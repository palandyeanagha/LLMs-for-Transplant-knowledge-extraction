Abstract
Background: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a common, progressive and invariably lethal interstitial lung
disease with no effective therapy. We hypothesised that KCa3.1 K+
 channel-dependent cell processes contribute to
IPF pathophysiology.
Methods: KCa3.1 expression in primary human lung myofibroblasts was examined using RT-PCR, western blot,
immunofluorescence and patch-clamp electrophysiology. The role of KCa3.1 channels in myofibroblast proliferation,
wound healing, collagen secretion and contraction was examined using two specific and distinct KCa3.1 blockers
(TRAM-34 and ICA-17043 [Senicapoc]).
Results: Both healthy non fibrotic control and IPF-derived human lung myofibroblasts expressed KCa3.1 channel
mRNA and protein. KCa3.1 ion currents were elicited more frequently and were larger in IPF-derived myofibroblasts
compared to controls. KCa3.1 currents were increased in myofibroblasts by TGFβ1 and basic FGF. KCa3.1 was
expressed strongly in IPF tissue. KCa3.1 pharmacological blockade attenuated human myofibroblast proliferation,
wound healing, collagen secretion and contractility in vitro, and this was associated with inhibition of TGFβ1-
dependent increases in intracellular free Ca2+
.
Conclusions: KCa3.1 activity promotes pro-fibrotic human lung myofibroblast function. Blocking KCa3.1 may offer a
novel approach to treating IPF with the potential for rapid translation to the clinic.

Introduction
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive fibrosing
interstitial pneumonia of unknown etiology [1]. The term IPF is
now restricted to patients with radiographic features consistent
with the histological pattern of usual interstitial pneumonia
(UIP). It occurs primarily in older adults [1] with an incidence of
16 per 100,000 person-years in the USA [2]. In the UK there
are over 4,000 cases diagnosed annually, which is an
equivalent disease burden with that of ovarian and kidney
cancers [3]. There is no effective treatment[1] and prognosis is
poor with a median survival of only 2-3 years from diagnosis
[3]. IPF therefore represents an important cause of morbidity
and mortality and novel approaches to treatment are required
urgently to address this unmet clinical need.
The pathogenic mechanisms involved in IPF initiation and
progression are poorly understood [4]. Myofibroblasts play a
critical role in tissue repair through cell-cell and cell-matrix
interactions [5], maintaining and regulating extracellular matrix,
interstitial fluid volume, and the extent of tissue contraction
needed for optimum function [6]. However, dysregulated or
inappropriate myofibroblast function leads to pathological
scarring and tissue fibrosis [7]. The myofibroblast is the
principle cell responsible for the synthesis and deposition of the
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 December 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 12 | e85244

fibrotic matrix in IPF and the associated tissue contraction [6].
Targeting pro-fibrotic myofibroblast activity therefore offers the
potential to slow down or halt the progression of IPF.
Ion channels are attractive therapeutic targets in many
chronic diseases. The Ca2+ activated K+
 channel KCa3.1 plays
an important role in Ca2+ signalling through its ability to
maintain a negative membrane potential during cell activation
[8]. The KCa3.1 channel modulates the activity of several
structural and inflammatory cells, including lymphocytes [9],
mast cells [10], and dedifferentiated smooth muscle cells [11],
through the regulation of cell proliferation [11], activation [9],
migration [10] and mediator release [12]. Pharmacological
inhibition or genetic deletion of KCa3.1 prevents surgically
induced renal fibrosis in mice by targeting myofibroblasts,
leading to reduced collagen deposition and fibroblast
proliferation while preserving renal parenchyma [13].
Both TGFβ1 and basicFGF are key growth factors which
drive myofibroblast-dependent fibrosis in IPF [5,6]. We
hypothesise that TGFβ1- and basicFGF-driven KCa3.1-
dependent cell processes are a common denominator in the
pathophysiology of IPF. In this study we have investigated the
expression and function of the KCa3.1 channel in primary
human lung myofibroblasts derived from both non-fibrotic and
IPF lungs.
Materials and Methods
Ethics statement
All patients donating tissue gave written informed consent
and the study was approved by the National Research Ethics
Service (references 07/MRE08/42 and 10/H0402/12).
Human lung myofibroblasts isolation and culture
Non-fibrotic control (NFC) myofibroblasts were derived from
healthy areas of lung from patients undergoing lung resection
for carcinoma at Glenfield Hospital. No morphological evidence
of disease was found in the tissue samples used for
myofibroblast isolation. IPF myofibroblasts were derived from
patients undergoing lung biopsy for diagnostic purposes at the
University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, and were shown to
have UIP on histological examination. Myofibroblasts were
grown from explanted lung tissue from both sources under
identical conditions, using Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
(DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS),
antibiotic/antimycotic agents and non-essential amino acids
[14,15]. The cells were cultured at 37°C in 5% CO2
/95% air.
Cells were studied at passages 4-5 for functional studies. All
NFC patients gave informed written consent and the study was
approved by the Leicestershire, Northamptonshire and Rutland
Research Ethics Committee 2. Written informed consent was
also obtained from all IPF subjects, in accordance with the
responsible University of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board.
Human myofibroblast characterisation using
immunofluorescent staining
Human myofibroblasts were harvested from 80-90%
confluent monolayers with 0.1% trypsin/0.1% EDTA. Cells were
seeded into 8-well chamber slides, grown to confluence, and
immunostained using the following antibodies: FITC￾conjugated mouse monoclonal anti-α-smooth muscle actin
(αSMA) (F3777, 10 µg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich, Poole, Dorset, UK)
and isotype control FITC-conjugated mouse IgG2a (X0933, 10
µg/ml, Dako, Ely, UK); mouse monoclonal anti-fibroblast
surface protein(FSP)(F4771, 4 µg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich) and
isotype control mouse IgM (M5909, 4 µg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich);
mouse monoclonal anti-fibroblast antigen THY-1 (CP28, 3
µg/ml, Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) and isotope control IgG1
(X0931, 3µg/ml, Dako); rabbit polyclonal anti-KCa3.1 (P4997, 8
µg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich; M20, a gift from Dr M Chen,
GlaxoSmithKline, Stevenage, UK), isotype control rabbit IgG
(550875, BD Pharmagen, 8 µg/ml). Rabbit polyclonal collagen
type 1 (550346, 20 µg/ml, Millipore, Watford, UK), isotype
control rabbit IgG (20 µg/ml). Monoclonal mouse CD68
antibody (6.4 µg/ml, Dako), isotype control IgG1 and CD34 R￾PE antibody (0.5 µg/ml, Catlag) and isotype control IgG1 R-PE
was also used. Secondary antibodies labelled with FITC or R￾PE (F0313, Dako) were applied and the cells counterstained
with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Sigma-Aldrich). Cells
were mounted with fluorescent mounting medium and cover￾slipped. Original images were captured on an epifluorescent
microscope (Olympus BX50, Olympus UK Ltd, Southend–on￾sea) and counted using Cell F imaging software (Olympus UK
Ltd). Matched exposures were used for isotype controls.
Immunohistochemistry on human lung tissue
Sections were cut at 4 µm from paraffin-embedded
diagnostic lung parenchymal biopsies or healthy control lung
obtained at cancer surgery, and immunostained using mouse
anti-αSMA mAb (1A4, 0.7 µg/ml, Dako), rabbit polyclonal anti￾KCa3.1 (AV35098, 5 µg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich), or appropriate
isotype control at the same concentration as the primary
antibody.
qRT-PCR
Myofibroblast RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Plus Kit
(Qiagen, West Sussex, UK) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. KCa3.1 gene expression was analyzed with the
gene-specific Quantitect Primer Assay (Qiagen, Hilden,
Germany), Hs_KCNN4_1_SG. The internal normaliser gene
used was β-actin (forward primer, 5’-
TTCAACTCCATCATGAAGTGTGACGTG-3’, reverse primer,
5’- CTAAGTCATAGTCCGCCTAGAAGCATT-3’). All
expression data was normalized to β-actin and corrected using
the reference dye ROX. Gene expression was quantified by
real-time PCR using the Brilliant SYBR Green QRT-PCR 1-
Step Master Mix (Strategene, Amsterdam, The Netherlands).
PCR products were run on a 1.5% agarose gel to confirm the
product amplified was the correct size: KCa3.1 130 base pairs
(bp), β-Actin 310 bp.
To study the effects of either TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml, R&D
Systems, Abingdon, UK) or bFGF (10 ng/ml, R&D Systems) on
KCa3.1 mRNA expression, cells were grown to confluence and
then serum starved for 24 h prior to growth factor exposure for
24 h.

Western blot
Human myofibroblasts were disrupted in lysis buffer and
soluble proteins from equivalent numbers of cells were
resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to an
immunobilon- P polyvinylidene difluoride membrane.
Membranes were blocked and incubated with rabbit polyclonal
KCa3.1 antibodies (Sigma antibodies P4997, AV35098 and
GSK gift antibody M20. Protein bands were identified by
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and
enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham, Little
Chalfont, UK). Immunolabelled proteins were visualized using
an ECL western blot detection system (GE Healthcare Life
Sciences, Buckinghamshire, UK).
Patch clamp electrophysiology
The whole cell variant of the patch clamp technique was
used as described previously[16,17]. The standard pipette
solution contained (in mM) KCl, 140; MgCl2
, 2; HEPES, 10; Na
+
-ATP, 2; GTP, 0.1 (pH 7.3). The standard external solution
contained (in mM) NaCl, 140; KCl, 5; CaCl2
, 2; MgCl2
,1;
HEPES, 10 (pH 7.3). For recording, myofibroblasts were
placed in 35-mm dishes containing standard external solution.
Whole-cell currents were recorded using an Axoclamp 200A
amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA), and currents
were evoked by applying voltage commands to a range of
potentials in 10 mV steps from a holding potential of –20 mV.
Drugs were added directly to the recording chamber. To elicit
KCa3.1 currents the KCa3.1 opener 1-ethyl-2-benzimidazolinone
(1-EBIO) (Tocris, Avonmouth, UK) was used at 100 µM. To
block KCa3.1 currents we used the specific KCa3.1 channel
blockers 1-[(2-chlorophenyl)diphenylmethyl]-1H-pyrazole
(TRAM-34) (200 nM)[18] and ICA-17043 (Senicapoc)(100 nM)
[19].
Human myofibroblast proliferation
Human lung myofibroblasts (n=4) were seeded into 6 well
plates, when 50% confluent cells were serum starved for 24h in
serum-free medium. Cells were then stimulated with serum￾free medium plus 0.1% DMSO, 10% FBS medium plus 0.1%
DMSO, 10% FBS plus TRAM-34 20 nM and 10% FBS plus
TRAM-34 200 nM. After 48h cells were mobilized with 0.1%
trypsin/0.1% EDTA and counted used a standard
haemocytometer. Cell viability was assessed by trypan blue
exclusion. Results were counted by 2 blinded observers with
excellent agreement (intra-class correlation of 0.969). All
conditions were performed in duplicate.
Wound healing assay
Human myofibroblasts were grown to confluence in 6 well
plates. After 24 h in serum-free medium, 3 artificial wounds
were scratched in each monolayer using a 200 µl pipette
creating a linear cell-free area. After washing, TRAM-34 (20
and 200 nM) and ICA-17043 (Senicapoc, a gift from Icagen Inc,
Durham, NC, USA) (10 and 100 nM) were added (final DMSO
concentration 0.1%), and the cells stimulated with either 10
ng/ml bFGF or 10% FBS alone for 48 h. Control wells
contained 0.1% DMSO and serum-free medium alone. Cells
migrating and proliferating into the wound were observed and
photographs taken over 48 h. Wound healing was analysed by
measuring the area of the scraped wound using Cell F software
by a blinded observer (Olympus, UK), and quantified as a
percentage of the starting area of the wound scraped. Data
presented represents the mean of the measurements from 2
different scratches. Results were measured by 2 blinded
observers with excellent agreement (intra-class correlation of
0.969).
Collagen Assay
Myofibroblasts were cultured in serum-free medium alone or
0.1% DMSO control, and stimulated with TGFβ1 10 ng/ml in
the presence of DMSO control, TRAM-34 (20 and 200 nM) and
ICA-17043 (10 and 100 nM) for 16 h. Soluble collagen released
by myofibroblasts was quantified using the Sircol collagen
assay (Biocolor, County Antrim, UK) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions [20,21].
Collagen Gel Contraction
Cells were pre-treated for 24 hours with serum-free media,
0.1% DMSO, TRAM-34 200 nM, ICA-17043 100 nM, TRAM-7
200 nM or TRAM-85 200 nM. Cells were detached and
collagen gels were set up as described in [22]. TGFβ1 and
bFGF were then added to appropriate wells to a final
concentration of 10 ng/ml. Photographs were taken at 0 h and
22 h. The surface area was measured at each time point using
ImageJ software (http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/) by 2 blinded
observers with excellent agreement (intraclass correlation of
0.974).
Calcium Imaging
Changes in [Ca2+]i were assessed with the use of a
flurometric Ca2+ probe Fura-2 (Sigma-Aldrich). Myofibroblasts
were grown on 35 mm fluorodish cell culture dishes (WPI,
Hertfordshire, UK) and when 40% confluent loaded with Fura-2
for 45 min at 37°C in normal physiological saline solution (140
mmol/L NaCl, 5 mmol/L KCl, 2 mmol/L CaCl2
, 1 mmol/L MgCl2
,
10 mmol/L HEPES, pH 7.4 with NAOH) containing 5 µmol/L
fura-2-acetoxymethyl ester and 2.5 mmol/L probenecid. The
cells were then washed and [Ca2+]i recorded using the single
cell recording system previously described [23]. Data
acquisition occurred at a rate of 1 dual wavelength image every
second and are presented as the 340 nm/380 nm ratio.
Statistical analysis
Experiments from an individual donor were performed either
in duplicate or triplicate and a mean value was derived for each
condition. Data distribution was tested for normality using the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. For parametric data the 1-way
ANOVA or repeated measures ANOVA for across-group
comparisons was used followed by the appropriate multiple
comparison post hoc test; otherwise an unpaired or paired t￾test was used. Where appropriate chi-squared tests were used.
For non-parametric data the Kruskal-Wallis test was used for
across group comparisons with the Dunn’s multiple comparison
post hoc test, or the Mann Whitney U test was used where

there were two unpaired groups. GraphPad Prism for windows
(version 6, GraphPad Software, San Diego California USA)
was used for these analyses. A value of P<0.05 was taken to
assume statistical significance.
Results
Characterization of human lung myofibroblasts
The clinical characteristics of the myofibroblast donors are
listed in Table 1. Cultured human lung myofibroblasts displayed
the typical morphology of fibroblast-related cells with a spindle
or stellate shape (Figure 1). No differences in THY-1, 1B10 and
αSMA expression were found between passages 2 and 4. At
passage 4, >98% of cells from all donors expressed the
fibroblast marker FSP, >97% expressed the fibroblast marker
THY-1, and >99% expressed αSMA, confirming that these cells
were almost exclusively myofibroblast in phenotype. Collagen 1
staining was present in 100% of cells (Figure 1). There was no
difference between NFC and IPF cells. No cells expressed the
macrophage/monocyte marker CD68 or mesenchymal cell
marker CD34. All isotype controls were negative (Figure 1).
Myofibroblasts express KCa3.1 channel mRNA, which is
up-regulated by TGFβ1
Human lung myofibroblasts (n=5 NFC, n=5 IPF) expressed
KCa3.1 mRNA (Figure 2a). No difference in KCa3.1 mRNA
expression was found between passages, but all experiments
were performed between passages 4 and 5 for consistency

(Figure 2b). KCa3.1 mRNA was significantly increased in cells
from NFC compared to IPF donors (Figure 2c). TGFβ1 (10
ng/ml) stimulation for 24h upregulated myofibroblast KCa3.1
channel mRNA relative to β-actin, which was significantly
greater in IPF compared NFC cells (Figure 2d). KCa3.1 mRNA
was up-regulated at least 8 fold in every IPF donor after TGFβ1
exposure (Figure 2e).
Myofibroblasts express KCa3.1 protein
KCa3.1 protein expression in human lung myofibroblasts was
identified by Western blot (n=6 NFC, n=5 IPF). The predicted
weight of KCa3.1 is 48kDa, but larger forms of ~53kDa and
several shorter splice variants exist [11,24-26]. Using two
different anti-KCa3.1 antibodies, M20 and P4997, a consistent
band of ~48kDa was observed (Figure 3a). M20 and P4997
also stained bands of 53kDa as described in human fibrocytes
and airway smooth muscle cells [11,26], and 39kDa consistent
with the presence of splice variants [25]. KCa3.1 protein
expression in myofibroblasts was also evident using
immunofluorescent staining (Figure 3b).
Myofibroblasts express KCa3.1 channel currents which
are increased in IPF
At baseline, myofibroblasts from NFC and IPF donors
demonstrated strong outwardly rectifying whole-cell currents,
and frequent inwardly rectifying currents with features of the
Kir2 family (confirmed by blocking with 10 µM barium, results
not shown). Interestingly, 69% of IPF cells had Kir2-like
currents at baseline as opposed to 42% of NFC cells
(P=0.0007, chi squared).
KCa3.1 currents in myofibroblasts were evoked using the
KCa3.1 opener 1-EBIO [27]. To block KCa3.1 we used two
distinct and selective KCa3.1 channel blockers, TRAM-34 (Kd
for KCa3.1 block 20 nM)[18] and ICA-17043 (Senicapoc)(Kd ~10
nM)[19]. KCa3.1 currents were not present at baseline but were
frequently elicited following the addition of 1-EBIO (100 µM),
and demonstrated the characteristic electrophysiological
features of KCa3.1 (Figure 3c and d). In addition, the 1-EBIO￾induced current was dose-dependently blocked by TRAM-34
(Figure 3c and d) and ICA-17043 (not shown) with complete
block at 200 nM and 100 nM respectively. DMSO vehicle (0.1%
final concentration) had no effect (not shown).
The addition of 1-EBIO elicited KCa3.1 currents in 59% of
NFC myofibroblasts (n=7 donors) and 77% of IPF
myofibroblasts (n=7 donors)(P=0.0411, Chi squared). Also, the
proportion of myofibroblasts per donor responding to 1-EBIO
was significantly increased in IPF compared to NFC cells
(P=0.0285)(Figure 4a), and the size of the currents induced by
1-EBIO was significantly greater in IPF compared to NFC cells
(P=0.0054, Mann Whitney test) (Figure 4b and c). Thus,
functional KCa3.1 channels were expressed more frequently
and the currents were larger in myofibroblasts derived from IPF
lung tissue compared to NFC tissue.
Measurements of myofibroblast capacitance were unreliable
due to the relatively large cell size, so it was not possible to
calculate current density.

from quantitative real-time PCR for KCa3.1 were visualized on a 1.5% agarose gel to confirm that only one product was amplified
and that it was the correct size (130 bp). β-Actin was used as the normalizing control (310bp). b) In preliminary experiments we
examined the mRNA expression levels of KCa3.1 in the NFC donors at passages 2, 4 and 7 and again found no significant
differences. To be sure that passage number had no effect all experiments were performed between passages 4 and 5. Data
represent mean±SEM. c) Quantitative real-time PCR showed that KCa3.1 mRNA expression was greater in NFC donors (n=5) than
IPF donors (n=5), P=0.0262 (unpaired t test). d) KCa3.1 mRNA expression increased after TGFβ1 stimulation (All groups; 1-way
ANOVA, P<0.0001), NFC donors (n=5), IPF donors (n=5). There was a highly significant increase in IPF myofibroblasts following
24h of TGFβ1 stimulation. P<0.0001 (corrected by Bonferroni's multiple comparison test). e) Quantitative real-time PCR
demonstrating the relative fold increase in NFC and IPF myofibroblasts after stimulation with TGFβ1. Following normalization with β￾actin there was a relative fold increase in KCa3.1 expression in all IPF donors. Results were calculated using the δδCT method. Data
represented as ±SEM for Figure 1b,c and d.

IPF donors have a relatively small inwardly rectifying Kir current (confirmed by blocking with 10 µM barium, results not shown).
Large currents with a negative reversal potential develop after the addition of the KCa3.1 opener 1-EBIO (100 µM), which are
blocked by the selective KCa3.1 blocker TRAM-34 (200 nM). Lower panels: The subtracted (1-EBIO minus TRAM-34) TRAM-34-

KCa3.1 Block Inhibits Myofibroblast Activity
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 8 December 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 12 | e85244

The proportion of myofibroblasts expressing KCa3.1
currents increases following mitogenic stimulation
After 24h of stimulation with 10 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth
factor (bFGF), a greater proportion of myofibroblasts from NFC
tissue expressed KCa3.1 currents in comparison to un￾stimulated cells (P=0.0035, corrected by Bonferroni’s multiple
comparisons test), indicating increased functional channel
expression. Similar results were seen in IPF myofibroblasts
using TGFβ1 (P=0.0336, corrected by Bonferroni’s multiple
comparisons test) (Figure 4d).
KCa3.1 immunoreactivity is expressed in IPF
parenchymal lung tissue
There was strong immunostaining for KCa3.1 in NFC lung
tissue (n=3), particularly in airway and alveolar epithelial cells,
but also in cells within the interstitium including vessels and
inflammatory cells (Figure 5a). KCa3.1 was also expressed
strongly in areas of parenchymal fibrosis in IPF and co￾localised with areas of αSMA positivity (n=5, IPF) (Figure 5b).
As there is no control for parenchymal fibrosis, we did not
compare the magnitude of KCa3.1 staining between NFC and
IPF tissue.
KCa3.1 channel inhibition inhibits myofibroblast
proliferation
Stimulation with 10% FBS for 48h significantly increased
myofibroblast proliferation over control (P=0.0040, corrected by
Bonferroni’s multiple comparisons test), in both NFC and IPF
donors, and to the same extent. However, KCa3.1 blockade with
TRAM-34 (200 nM) inhibited FBS-induced proliferation
(P=0.0076, corrected by Bonferroni’s multiple comparisons
test)(Figure 6a).
Selective pharmacological blockade of KCa3.1
attenuates wound healing
Myofibroblast wound healing was assessed in a 2-D scratch
assay (Figure 6b). Myofibroblasts stimulated with 10% FBS
showed enhanced wound repair compared to media alone
(P<0.0001, paired t-test). There was no difference between
NFC- and IPF-derived cells and all data are pooled (Figure 6c).
Wound healing in the absence of FBS or bFGF was not
affected by KCa3.1 blockade (Figure 6d) and no inhibition of
wound healing was seen with two structurally related molecules
without channel blocking activity, TRAM-85 and TRAM-7
(Figure 6e)[13,28].
FBS-induced wound repair was dose-dependently
attenuated by both TRAM-34 and ICA-17043 (repeated
measures ANOVA, P<0.0001 and P=0.0095 respectively)
(Figure 7a and b). Thus, in 10% FBS, total wound healing
decreased by (mean±SEM) 30.6±5.4% with TRAM-34 200 nM
and by 17.2±5.9% with ICA-17043 100 nM; this was equivalent
to inhibition of the FBS-dependent response by 75.7±10.9%
and 47.9±15.3% respectively.
Compared to unstimulated cells, bFGF (10ng/ml) also
increased myofibroblast wound healing over 48h in both NFC
and IPF donors (P=0.002, paired t-test). bFGF-induced wound
repair was dose-dependently attenuated by ICA-17043
(repeated measures ANOVA, P=0.0076)(Figure 7c). At 48 h,
total wound healing was reduced by 24.4±6.6% in the presence
of ICA-17043 100 nM compared to DMSO control (equivalent
to inhibition of the FGF-dependent response by 63.4±13.4%).
In summary, mitogen-induced wound healing of human lung
myofibroblasts is attenuated by KCa3.1 channel block.
TGFβ1-dependent collagen production in human
myofibroblasts is attenuated by KCa3.1 blockade
Myofibroblasts from both IPF and NFC lung secreted similar
amounts of collagen in response to TGFβ1 (10 ng/ml). This
was markedly attenuated by both TRAM-34 and ICA-17043
(Figure 8a and b), but was not affected by TRAM-85 or
TRAM-7 (Figure 8c).
KCa3.1 inhibition attenuates TGF-β1 and bFGF induced
myofibroblast contraction
Myofibroblasts cultured in collagen gels from both IPF and
NFC donors contracted following TGFβ1 stimulation and bFGF
stimulation (Figure 9). After dose response experiments were
performed, 10 ng/ml chosen as the optimal concentration for
each growth factor (Figure 9a and b). There was no difference
between NFC- and IPF-derived cells (Figure 9c,) and all data
are therefore pooled. TGFβ1 stimulation increased
myofibroblast contraction from (mean±SEM) 30.6±3.6% to
48.6±2.4%, and bFGF stimulation increased myofibroblast
contraction from 31.7±3.8% to 51.2±4.8%. Compared to DMSO
control, pre-treatment for 24 h in the presence of either
TRAM-34 200 nM or ICA-17043 100 nM almost completely
inhibited both TGFβ1- and bFGF-stimulated myofibroblast
contraction (Figure 10a-d). In contrast, the control molecules
TRAM-7 and TRAM-85 were without effect (not shown).
TRAM-34 and ICA-17043 did not inhibit baseline constitutive
myofibroblast contraction significantly in the absence of growth
factors (Figure 9d and e), indicating that TRAM-34 and
ICA-17043 only inhibit TGFβ1- or bFGF-dependent
myofibroblast contraction.
KCa3.1 regulates myofibroblast pro-fibrotic functions by
inhibiting TGFβ1 induced increases in [Ca2+]i
Open Kca3.1 channels hyperpolarise plasma membranes
which in turn promotes Ca2+ influx [12]. This is believed to
account for the ability of KCa3.1 inhibition to attenuate many
diverse cell responses. To investigate the underlying
mechanism behind the attenuation of pro-fibrotic myofibroblast
function with KCa3.1 blockers, we therefore investigated
whether changes in [Ca2+]i occur following stimulation with
TGFβ1. TGFβ1 (10 ng/ml) elicited an immediate, rapid rise in
[Ca2+]i in 100% of IPF cells and 53% of NFC cells. There was a
significant increase in [Ca2+]i for both IPF (n=33, P<0.0001) and
NFC (n=28, P<0.0001)(Figure 11a). In the IPF donors only,
TRAM-34 was added 5 minutes prior to the addition of TGFβ1
which inhibited the TGFβ1 induced rise in [Ca2+]i (Figure 11b).
The change in [Ca2+]i following TGFβ1 stimulation was
significantly reduced with 5 minutes pre-treatment of TRAM-34
200 nM compared to controls, P<0.0001 (Figure 11c). Cells
were also treated with 0.1% DMSO control which had no effect

Discussion
There are three major, novel findings from this study. Firstly
we have performed the first detailed electrophysiological

analysis of primary human parenchymal myofibroblasts from
both NFC and IPF lung, and show for the first time that these
cells express the Ca2+-activated K+
 channel KCa3.1 in both
health and disease. Secondly we demonstrate that
pharmacological blockade of KCa3.1 inhibits human lung
myofibroblast pro-fibrotic activity such as proliferation wound
healing, collagen secretion and growth factor-dependent
contraction. Thirdly, TGFβ1-induced myofibroblast pro-fibrotic
function is associated with KCa3.1-dependent regulation of
[Ca2+]i. These findings highlight the importance of the KCa3.1
channel and Ca2+ signaling in the growth factor-dependent pro￾fibrotic functions of human lung myofibroblasts.
The widely accepted markers of a myofibroblast are that it
co-expresses fibroblast-associated markers and αSMA fibres
[6]. The cells studied in these experiments were predominantly
of a myofibroblast phenotype, a finding consistent with the
parenchymal lung myofibroblast phenotype described by others
[29,30].
KCa3.1 channel mRNA, protein and functional channels were
expressed in myofibroblasts derived from both NFC and IPF
donors. Interestingly, KCa3.1 currents were present more
frequently in IPF lung myofibroblasts and these currents were
larger when compared to NFC lung myofibroblasts. This might
reflect KCa3.1 up-regulation driven by the initiating disease
insult in vivo, but the cells studied had been through 4
passages of culture, raising the possibility of an underlying
disease-predisposing difference in myofibroblast KCa3.1 activity
in patients with IPF. Surprisingly, although KCa3.1 currents were
increased in IPF myofibroblasts, KCa3.1 mRNA was decreased.
However, chronic exposure of cells to the KCa3.1 opener 1-
EBIO down-regulates KCa3.1 mRNA expression [31,32],
suggesting a negative-feedback mechanism which is perhaps
operative here. Whether the increased KCa3.1 plasma
membrane expression in IPF myofibroblasts represents
increased trafficking to the cell membrane or decreased
turnover requires further study.

TGFβ1 is a key mediator of fibrotic diseases, playing an
important role in myofibroblast differentiation [33], matrix
protein production [34], and possibly epithelial-mesenchymal
transition [35]. TGFβ1 stimulation increased myofibroblast
KCa3.1 mRNA expression, which was greatest in IPF-derived
myofibroblasts, and increased the frequency of cells
expressing functional membrane channels. bFGF, another key
mediator in fibrotic diseases, is a potent chemoattractant and
mitogen for myofibroblasts, and regulates extracellular matrix
production[34]. bFGF stimulation also increased the frequency
of cells expressing KCa3.1 currents (mRNA expression was not
studied). These observations are in keeping with bFGF- and
TGFβ1-dependent KCa3.1 upregulation in several cell types
[36].
The upregulation of functional KCa3.1 channels by both
TGFβ1 and bFGF suggests that the biological effects of these
growth factors might rely heavily on KCa3.1 channel activity.
This is supported by the observations that serum-dependent
proliferation, serum- and bFGF-dependent myofibroblast
wound healing, TGFβ1-dependent collagen secretion, and both
bFGF and TGFβ1-dependent myofibroblast contraction were
attenuated by two distinct and specific KCa3.1 blockers,
TRAM-34 and ICA-17043. Importantly, these ion channel
blockers inhibited these cell processes at physiologically
relevant concentrations. Thus it takes 5-10x the Kd
 to inhibit
almost all channels (Kd=concentration producing 50% block).
The Kd
 for TRAM-34 is 20 nM [11] and for ICA-17043 6-10 nM
[10]. At 10x the Kd
 for both blockers, myofibroblast wound

healing, collagen secretion and contraction were significantly
attenuated. At these concentrations both drugs are specific and
not known to affect other ion channels, receptors or
transporters [13]. Furthermore, the effects of TRAM-34 and
ICA-17043 on myofibroblast biology were not mimicked by
TRAM-7 or TRAM-85, two molecules of similar structure to
TRAM-34 which do not block KCa3.1 ion channels [13,28].
Upon TGFβ1 stimulation human lung myofibroblast exhibited
a rise in [Ca2+]i concentrations which was blocked by TRAM-34.
This demonstrates how both membrane hyperpolarization and
Ca2+ influx is critical for myofibroblast function in keeping with
observations in other cells types [10,11,26], and provides
mechanistic insight for the role of KCa3.1 in lung myofibroblast
responses.
Although KCa3.1 channels were more highly expressed in IPF
myofibroblasts than in NFC cells, the functional responses of
the cells to growth factors were largely similar irrespective of
their source. This is perhaps not surprising because membrane
hyperpolarization can be achieved with as few as 12 channels
per cell [32], meaning that Ca2+ dependent cell processes can
proceed with very low channel expression. Similar shifts in
membrane potential in NFC and IPF myofibroblasts are evident
in Figure 3c. However, the presence of significantly more
channels in IPF myofibroblasts suggests that it will be more
difficult for a physiological process to overcome the effects of
the increased channel activity. This however does not apply to
channel blockers which will inhibit 10 or 1000 channels equally
effectively. Therefore pharmacological KCa3.1 blockers are
attractive targets as they block all channels and will potentially
attenuate pro-fibrotic responses as shown in this study.
KCa3.1 was expressed in both NFC and IPF lung tissue,
supporting the relevance of our in vitro findings. In IPF tissue,

KCa3.1 was not only expressed in areas of αSMA positivity, but
also highly expressed in alveolar epithelial cells, vessels and
inflammatory cells. In addition to alveolar epithelial cells, both
mast cells and fibrocytes are implicated in IPF progression and
express KCa3.1 [10,26]. Targeting KCa3.1 in IPF may therefore
have additional benefits over and above those achieved
through the inhibition of myofibroblast function.
Our data indicate that the KCa3.1 channel may play a key role
in the development of lung fibrosis, in both IPF and other lung
disorders. KCa3.1 is an attractive pharmacological target as it
appears to play a minor role in healthy physiology, but

stimulation with TGFβ1 (10 ng/ml) both NFC (n=4 donor, n=28 cells) and IPF (n=3 donors, n=33 cells) donors showed a significant

cells), TRAM-34 (200 nM) was added 5 minutes prior to treatment with TGFβ1, which inhibited the rise in [Ca2+]i typically seen upon
TGFβ1 stimulation. c) The difference in [Ca2+]i following the different treatments were calculated and TRAM-34 significantly
decreased the change in [Ca2+]i, P<0.0001, Mann Whitney t-test.

contributes significantly to tissue remodeling and fibrosis [37]. It
has been suggested that KCa3.1 opening contributes to
pulmonary vascular relaxation in rats[38], but this was not the
case in human pulmonary vessels[39]. Importantly, KCa3.1
knockout mice are viable, of normal appearance, produce
normal litter sizes, and exhibit rather mild phenotypes [13].
High doses of TRAM-34 administered to rodents over many
weeks are well tolerated [13] and the orally available KCa3.1
blocker, ICA-17043, has been administered to humans in
phase 2 and 3 trials of sickle cell disease with minor side
effects [40]. There is therefore the potential for the rapid
investigation of KCa3.1 blockade in clinical trials of IPF and
other fibrotic lung diseases.
