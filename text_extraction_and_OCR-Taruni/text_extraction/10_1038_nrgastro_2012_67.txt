Introduction
End-stage liver diseases that are caused by 
chronic HCV infection are currently the 
leading indications for liver transplanta￾tion.1
 However, HCV reinfection of the 
graft occurs universally and often results 
in accelerated recurrence of liver fibrosis 
and early development of cirrhosis.2
 HCV 
infection is also the most frequent cause 
of liver disease after kidney transplanta￾tion and is an independent risk factor for 
graft loss.3
 In general, the current standard 
therapy for patients with HCV (PEG-IFN‑α 
in combination with ribavirin) is much less 
effective in patients who have had a liver 
transplant than in those who have not 
had a transplant.4
 An aggravated course of 
infection and increased resistance to anti￾viral therapy have been attributed to several 
host and viral factors, in particular the 
application of specific immunosuppressive 
medication.5
 Over the past five decades, the 
immunosuppressive regimen has evolved 
from being mainly based on glucocortico￾steroids, azathioprine and ciclosporin A to 
steroid-sparing regimens involving anti￾IL‑2 receptor antibody induction therapy, 
calcineurin inhibition by tacrolimus 
and the use of new-generation immuno￾suppressants—mycophenolate mofetil and 
rapamycin. The changes in drug types and 
drug combinations together with increases 
in the age of donors have probably contrib￾uted to the reported worsening of HCV 
recurrence since the early 1990s.6
 Although 
enormous efforts have been devoted to 
clinical research,7
 the choice of immuno￾suppressants in HCV-positive recipients is 
still a subject of debate.
The lack of good model systems ham￾pered HCV research in its early stages. 
However, this deficiency has improved 
dramatically in the past decade with the 
development of various in vitro systems 
of cell culture (Box 1). The HCV pseudo￾particles, the HCV replicons and the JFH‑1-
derived infectious HCV cell culture systems 
have all demonstrated their importance in 
studies on different aspects of the viral life 
cycle and pathophysiology, including viral 
entry, trafficking in the cell and assem￾bly and release of de novo virus particles.8
These models have enabled basic research 
to make considerable contributions to an 
improved understanding of how immuno￾suppressive compounds can actually influ￾ence HCV infection and the antiviral action 
of interferons.
In this article, we explore the potential 
molecular interaction of different immuno￾suppressants with HCV and interferon 
signalling. We also discuss how to extrapo￾late these laboratory findings into clinical 
practice and drug development.
Calcineurin inhibitors
The primary cellular targets of the calci￾neurin inhibitors are immunophilins. 
Ciclosporin A binds to cyclophilins, and 
tacrolimus (also known as FK506) binds 
to FK binding proteins (FKBPs); both 
events result in a profound inhibition of 
the phosphatase activity of calcineurin. 
Immunophilin-dependent signal transduc￾tion via calcineurin represents a key event 
in the activation of T‑cell proliferation 
by regulating expression of the gene that 
encodes IL‑2 (Figure 1a). Apart from their 
role in calcineurin signalling, immuno￾philins are catalysts of protein folding and 
as such have a supportive role in viral infec￾tion. Viruses, including HIV, herpes simplex 
virus, vaccinia virus, vesicular stomatitis 
virus and coronaviruses, take advantage of 
immunophilins for their replication, and 
this virus–host interaction is inhibited by 
ciclosporin A.9,10 Moreover, cyclophilin A 
can actually incorporate itself into these 
viral particles.9,11 For HCV, it is well estab￾lished that cyclophilins have an essential 
role in viral replication and de novo virus 
production. Early studies suggest that HCV 
replication is dependent on the interaction 
between cyclophilin B and nonstructural 
protein 5B (NS5B, HCV RNA polymerase) 
to stimulate its RNA binding activity and 
thereby promote the de novo synthesis of 
positive and negative stranded RNA.12,13
Ciclosporin A blocks the binding of cyclo￾philin B to NS5B RNA and thereby inhib￾its viral replication.12–14 Cyclophilin A 
also directly interacts with NS5B15 and is

insight into immunosuppression and HCV

Abstract | Liver transplantation is an effective treatment for end-stage liver disease 
that is attributable to chronic HCV infection. However, long-term outcomes are 
compromised by universal virological recurrence in the graft. Reinfection that 
occurs after transplantation has increased resistance to current interferon￾based antiviral therapy and often leads to accelerated development of cirrhosis. 
Important risk factors for severe HCV recurrence are linked to immunosuppression. 
Owing to the lack of good randomized, controlled trials, the optimal choice of 
immunosuppressants is still debated. By contrast, much progress has been made in 
the understanding of HCV biology and the antiviral action of interferons. These new 
insights have greatly expanded our knowledge of the molecular interplay between 
HCV and immunosuppressive drugs. In this article, we explore the effect of different 
immunosuppressants on the complex cellular events involved in HCV infection 
and interferon signalling. Potential implications for clinical practice and future drug 
development are discussed.

involved in modulating the polyprotein 
cleavage activity of NS2.16 In addition, 
cyclophilin A interacts with NS5A and 
stimulates its binding with HCV RNA.15,17
As ciclosporin A interacts with both 
cyclophilin A and cyclophilin B, it is con￾ceivable that it affects multiple steps in the 
virus life cycle (Figure 1b). The anti-HCV 
activity of ciclosporin A is not mediated by 
an interferon response and is independ￾ent of calcineurin signalling.14 Although 
studies showed a role for FKBP8 in HCV 
replication18 through interaction with 
NS5A,19 FKBP8 lacks several amino acid 
residues thought to be important for tac￾rolimus binding.18,20 No evidence exists that 
tacrolimus inhibits HCV replication.14
Several in vitro studies have shown 
that ciclosporin A can act in synergy with 
IFN‑α,
21–24 but clinical evidence to support 
these findings is still limited.25 The results of 
a prospective, randomized, controlled pilot 
study published in 2010 demonstrated that 
a switch from tacrolimus to ciclosporin A 
resulted in a modest drop in serum levels 
of HCV RNA and an enhancement of the 
response to antiviral interferon therapy in 
patients who had received a liver transplant.26
This finding supports those of a previous 
study that observed a benefit of converting 
from tacrolimus to ciclosporin A during 
pre-emptive IFN‑α and ribavirin antiviral 
therapy in patients who were HCV positive 
and had undergone liver transplantation.27
The mechanism by which ciclosporin A can 
promote the response to interferon is an 
intriguing issue. Hirano et al.28 suggested 
that tacrolimus, but not ciclosporin A, 
interferes with interferon signal transduc￾tion. However, a later study did not confirm 
this suggestion, instead demonstrating in 
two state-of-the-art cell culture models that 
tacrolimus does not interfere with either 
interferon signalling or the antiviral activity 
of interferon.29 Therefore, no further mecha￾nistic understanding has been unveiled on 
this issue.
In fact, the first in vitro evidence that 
ciclosporin A but not tacrolimus can inhibit 
HCV replication14 sparked the clinical 
debate on the possible differential effect of 
these two drugs on HCV recurrence.30 As 
HCV only infects humans and chimpanzees, 
small animal models for HCV infection are 
still difficult to create. One of the few estab￾lished experimental animal models to study 
HCV infection is the SCID/uPA (severe 
combined immunodeficient, urokinase 
plasminogen activator transgenic) mouse 
engrafted with primary human hepatocytes. 
A study published in 2011 by the group that 
pioneered the development of this mouse 
model has attempted to define the effect 
of ciclosporin A and tacrolimus on serum 
HCV titres and antiviral interferon therapy 
in vivo.
31 Although no statistically signifi￾cant differences were observed between 
ciclosporin A and tacrolimus either on 
HCV viral titres or the efficacy of interferon 
therapy, effects could have been masked by 
some technical limitations. Firstly, the base￾line HCV titres differed between the tested 
groups, with a trend toward higher base￾line HCV RNA levels in the ciclosporin A 
arms than in the tacrolimus arms. Secondly, 
the antiviral response to interferon in this 
model was much less robust than that 
observed in patients. Moreover, models 
in immunodeficient mice cannot evalu￾ate indirect effects of immunosuppressive 
drugs on antiviral immune responses unless 
one of the latest immunocompetent mouse 
models is used.32
The development of ciclosporin A deriva￾tives strongly indicates that ciclosporin A 
would have anti-HCV activity both in vitro
and in patients. Three cyclophilin inhibitors 
are currently being evaluated in preclinical 
and clinical studies: Debio‑025, NIM811 
and SCY‑635.33 These compounds are 
developed by structural modifications of 
ciclosporin A to enhance the antiviral activ￾ity and reduce the immunosuppression cap￾acity by increasing cyclophilin binding and 
abolishing calcineurin affinity, respectively. 
Debio‑025 has been the first to enter clinical 
trials and the first results are encourag￾ing. In a cohort infected with HCV and 
HIV, 2 weeks of treatment with Debio‑025 
decreased HCV viral load by more than 
3‑log, including in patients infected with 
HCV genotypes 1, 3 and 4. By contrast, 
the anti-HIV effects were much less pro￾nounced (1‑log reduction of viral load).34
In treatment-naive patients infected with 
just HCV, treatment with Debio‑025 alone 
resulted in a more than 2‑log reduction of 
viral load in those with genotypes 1 and 4, 
and a more than 4‑log reduction in those 
with genotypes 2 and 3.35 When combined 
with PEG-IFN‑α and ribavirin, additive 
antiviral effects were demonstrated.35
Glucocorticosteroids
Glucocorticosteroids have been used since 
the early years of organ transplantation. 
Prednisolone and its close analogue dexa￾methasone are potent suppressors of the 
immune system, as they modulate cellular 
and inflammatory responses via stimula￾tion or inhibition of gene transcription 
(Figure 1).36 Although evidence indicates 
that the oestrogen receptor is functionally 
involved in HCV replication by promoting 
NS5B association with the viral replication 
complex,37 the role of other glucocortico￾steroid receptors is largely unknown. A 
study using the HCV subgenomic replicon 
model38 found that both prednisolone and 
dexamethasone have no stimulatory effects 
on RNA levels, but rather have minor inhib￾itory effects.39 Using an infectious HCV 
model (the JFH1-derived chimera Jc1 in 
Huh‑7.5 cells), similar results were obtained 
showing ~50% inhibition of viral replication 
at high doses of prednisolone.40 However, 
in this infectious model, prednisolone 
stimulated HCV infection by enhancing 
virus entry.40 This specific enhancement 
was mechanistically linked to the upregu￾lation of the two essential HCV entry 
factors—occludin and scavenger receptor 
class B type I—at both mRNA and protein 
levels.40 On the basis of their observations, 
the authors speculated that treatment 
with a steroid bolus (>250 mg predniso￾lone per day) in patients with HCV might 
foster virus dissemination through facilita￾tion of virus entry into hepatocytes, thus 
aggravating HCV recurrence. Moreover, 
treatment with prednisolone probably sup￾presses the patient’s immune control of the 
HCV-infected cells, by effects on T cells41
and plasmacytoid dendritic cells,42 and 
thereby might indirectly accentuate infec￾tion.39 Plasmacytoid dendritic cells are

■ The first full-length HCV clones could 
infect chimpanzees but replication 
in vitro remained ineffective. By creating 
antibiotic-resistant HCV genomes, 
selection of replication-competent viral 
clones became possible. This advance 
led to the development of subgenomic or 
bicistronic (two cistrons) replicons, which 
mimic HCV replication. HCV replicons 
are most efficient in a human hepatoma 
cell line (Huh7), and can be linked to 
fluorescent or luminescent reporter genes

patient with fulminant hepatitis C. JFH‑1-

of particular interest in HCV infection, 
as they produce large amounts of IFN‑α; 
however, the capability of plasmacytoid 
dendritic cells to produce IFN‑α seems to 
be reduced in patients with chronic HCV.43
Experimental data from our group have 
shown that treatment with prednisolone 
abolishes the anti-HCV activity of plasma￾cytoid dendritic cells in vitro (P. E. de Ruiter, 
personal communication).
In liver transplantation, glucocortico￾steroids are often given as an induc￾t ion proto col dur ing surger y and 
low doses in combination with other 
immunosuppressants are used as mainte￾nance immune suppression after transplan￾tation. In cases of acute cellular rejection 
episodes, patients receive several boluses of 
methylprednisolone to reverse the rejection. 
The most compelling evidence that steroids 
affect HCV viral load actually came from 
studies in patients with HCV who did not 
undergo a liver transplant.44–46 In a trans￾plant setting, the general consensus is that 
steroid avoidance47 or slow tapering of the 
dose48 is associated with reduced disease 
recurrence, whereas boluses for treat￾ing acute rejection can increase the viral 
load.49,50 However, a randomized multi￾centre study comparing steroid-free therapy 
and standard immunosuppression showed 
no clear advantage of not using steroids in 
liver transplant recipients who had HCV.51

Two systematic Cochrane reviews with 
meta-analyses of randomized, controlled 
trials have been performed in the settings 
of chronic HCV52 and HBV53 infection 
to comprehensively assess the effects of 
glucocorticosteroids on interferon antiviral 
therapy. No statistically significant effect of 
steroids on the virological response at the 
end of treatment was found in patients 
with HCV.52 By contrast, pretreatment with 
steroids was associated with a considerably 
higher frequency of loss of hepatitis B e 
antigen and HBV DNA, although no statis￾tically significant effect on clinical outcomes 
was found.53 However, mechanistic studies 
have shown that glucocorticosteroids can 
interfere with signal transduction of the 
interferon receptor. The glucocorticosteroid 
receptor and type I interferon receptor sig￾nalling pathways share the cofactor gluco￾corticoid receptor-interacting protein 1 
(GRIP1).54,55 Glucocorticosteroids sup￾press interferon responses by antagonizing 
the heterotrimeric STAT1–STAT2–IRF9 
(ISGF3) activity via GRIP156 or attenuation 
of STAT1 activation through induction of 
SOCS1, which is a suppressor of cytokine 
signalling 1 (Figure 1).57 However, these 
events probably differ between cell types 
and no direct link between these molecular 
interactions and viral infection has been 
well established. Therefore, it is of particular 
relevancy to further investigate the actual 
effects of steroids on interferon antiviral 
response in HCV models.
MMF and MPA
Mycophenolic acid (MPA) is the activated 
form of the prodrug mycophenolate mofetil 
(MMF). MMF and MPA are part of the 
class of antimetabolite immunosuppressive 
agents that also includes azathioprine. The 
effect of azathioprine on HCV has not been 
extensively studied, despite one early study 
suggesting that this agent has antiviral 
effects on two Flaviviridae viruses.58
MMF is commonly used in kidney 
transplantation, but it is also approved by 
the FDA for the prophylaxis of allograft 
rejection after heart or liver transplanta￾tion.59 In addition to its potent immuno￾suppressive capacity, MPA also has a broad 
spectrum of antiviral activity in vitro
against numerous DNA and RNA viruses, 
including dengue virus,60 West Nile virus,23
yellow fever virus,61 Chikungunya virus,62
HBV63 and HCV.23 MPA is an uncompeti￾tive inhibitor of inosine monophosphate 
dehydrogenase (IMPDH), in particular the 
isoform IMPDH2. Inhibition of IMPDH 
decreases intracellular levels of guanosine 
nucleotide pools resulting in inadequate 
quantities for nominal DNA duplication, 
which was thought to be the antiprolifera￾tive and immunosuppressive mechanism 
of MPA (Figure 2a).64 This mechanism is 
probably also responsible for its antiviral 
effects against at least the West Nile,23 yellow 
fever61 and Chikungunya viruses,62 as sup￾plementation by exogenous guanosine 
almost completely overcomes these inhibi￾tory effects. By contrast, supplementation 
of guanosine had little effect on the inhibi￾tion of HCV replication.23,65 Consistently, 
ectopic expression of IMPDH2 mutants 
lacking the binding site for MPA largely 
restored its antiproliferative effect, but with 
only minor effects on HCV replication, sug￾gesting other mechanisms are involved in its 
anti-HCV action.66 Unexpectedly, MPA was 
found to induce the expression of impor￾tant antiviral interferon-stimulated genes 
in HCV cell culture models, including 
interferon regulatory factor (IRF) 1, IRF9 
and interferon-induced transmembrane 
protein 3 (IFITM3).66 Using an RNAi￾based loss-of-function approach, IRF1 was 
demonstrated to be directly involved in the 
anti-HCV activity of MPA.66
The expression of a panel of interferon￾stimulated genes was also considerably 
higher in peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells of patients who had received a kidney 
transplant and were maintained on MMF 
immunosuppression, compared with 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 
healthy control individuals.66 Similar results 
have been reported for ribavirin, which 
also induces expression of a broad spec￾trum of interferon-stimulated genes.67,68
Interestingly, like MPA, ribavirin is a known 
inhibitor of IMPDH.69 Inhibiting IMPDH 
and inducing the expression of interferon￾stimulated genes probably simultaneously 
contribute to the anti-HCV action of MPA 
(Figure 2b). Whether IMPDH by itself is 
involved in the induction of the expres￾sion of interferon-stimulated genes is not 
fully clear. However, supplementation with 
exogenous guanosine did not interfere with 
inducing the expression of these genes.66
Although the safety and efficacy of MMF 
as an immunosuppressive medication in 
patients with HCV who received a trans￾plant has been demonstrated, the exact 
effects on HCV recurrence have not been 
clearly studied in prospective, randomized 
and double-blinded trials. Results from 
prospective nonrandomized or retrospec￾tive studies remain controversial at this 
point of time. However, the in vivo effi￾cacy of many antiviral compounds (such 
as ribavirin) can be observed only when 
combined with other antivirals. Ribavirin 
has shown substantial anti-HCV activity 
in vitro but is generally considered to have 
little or no detectable antiviral activity as a 
monotherapy in patients.70 However, when 
combined with IFN‑α, ribavirin increases 
the sustained virologic response by three￾fold.71 Similarly, a previous clinical study 
showed that combined treatment with 
MMF and PEG‑IFN‑α in patients with 
chronic HCV resulted in a considerably 
improved end-of-therapy response rate in 
a difficult-to-treat population of previous 
nonresponders to standard therapy.72 The 
sustained virologic response of the IFN‑α 
and MMF combination group, however, was 
lower than that of the group treated with 
IFN‑α and ribavirin.72 A possible explana￾tion for these limited sustained virologic 
responses is that MMF interferes with a 
robust antiviral immune response required 
to eliminate HCV.23 Notably, MPA works 
in synergy with IFN‑α on HCV replication 
in vitro.
23 When combined with IFN‑α, 
MPA augments the transcription of mul￾tiple interferon-stimulated genes that are 
mediated by interferon-stimulated response 
elements.66 These latest findings have shed 
some light on the molecular basis of how 
MPA works in synergy with IFN‑α.
Rapamycin
Rapamycin, a new-generation immuno￾suppressant, has been gaining increas￾ing favour in the transplantation context, 
mainly attributable to its low nephrotoxicity 
and potential anticancer properties.73
Rapamycin engages the cytosolic protein 
FKBP12 to form a complex. This complex 
inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin 
(mTOR) pathway by directly binding to the 
mTOR complex 1, resulting in blockage of 
cell cycle progression at the G1 to S phase 
and thereby causing inhibition of T‑cell 
proliferation (Figure 2).
One particular interesting feature of 
rapamycin is that it induces autophagy by 
inhibition of mTOR. Autophagy is a process 
for catabolising organelles and other cyto￾plasmic components to balance cellular 
metabolism and to promote cell survival 
during stressful conditions. Autophagy is 
also an important event in regulation of the 
cellular response against viral infections.74
The role of autophagy is complex and can 
have both antiviral and proviral effects in 
different virus infections. During infection,

autophagy can be a surveillance mechanism 
that delivers viral antigens to endosomal 
compartments to stimulate innate immune 
signalling and to provide processed anti￾gens for presentation in the major histo￾compatibility complex. Virus infection can 
trigger the induction of autophagy, but can 
also block the function of the autophagy 
pathway or even subvert autophagy. By 
contrast, viruses can directly exploit the 
autophagy machinery to facilitate replica￾tion or to promote their maturation and the 
dissemination of virions.75
Several studies have shown that HCV 
infection induces autophagy in hepato￾cytes via the unfolded protein response.76,77
Howe ve r, t h e i n du c e d autoph a g y 
appears incomplete, as the maturation 
of autophagosomes to autolysosomes is 
blocked. Therefore, autophagosomes are 
not degraded but instead support viral 
replication.77 HCV viral proteins, such 
as NS5B, directly interact with the host 
proteins that are required for the induc￾tion of autophagy.78 In addition, induction 
of autophagy by HCV seems to facilitate 
infection by reducing the innate immu￾nity of host cells, including interferon 
responses79,80 Indeed, accumulating evidence 
exists for a direct link between the mTOR 
signalling pathway and interferon-activated 
JAK-STAT signalling.81–83 Type I interferon 
induces phosphorylation and activation of 
mTOR in a PI3-kinase-dependent manner.83
In addition, mTOR complex 1 was found to 
stimulate the production of type I inter￾ferons through activation of IRF5 and 
IRF7.82 On the basis of these mechanistic 
insights, it is conceivable that rapamycin 
could affect HCV recurrence and antiviral 
interferon therapy, though clinical evidence 
to support this theory is still limited.84,85

mycophenolic acid and rapamycin. 
Mechanisms shown in a | leukocytes and 
b | hepatocytes. The uptake of MPA by cells 
involves organic anion transporting 
polypeptides and probably other transporters 
as well. MPA is an uncompetitive inhibitor of 
IMPDH and results in the inhibition of de novo
nucleotide biosynthesis. Insufficient 
intracellular levels of guanosine nucleotide 
pools result in a defect of nominal DNA 
duplication that is thought to be the 
immunosuppressive mechanism of MPA. In 
hepatocytes, persistent attenuation of 
nucleotide biosynthesis by MPA partially 
contributes to the inhibition of HCV 
replication. In addition to this IMPDH￾dependent antiviral pathway, MPA also 
conveys a rapid antiviral effect mediated by 
induction of the expression of interferon￾stimulated genes. Through an unknown 
mechanism, MPA directly potentiates the 
activity of the ISRE promoter element both in 
the presence or absence of IFN‑α stimulation. 
Rapamycin engages the cytosolic protein 
FKBP12 to form a complex. This complex 
inhibits the mTOR pathway by directly binding 
to the mTORC1, resulting in blockage of cell 
cycle progression at the G1 to S phase and 
thereby causing inhibition of T‑cell

infection. The mTOR pathway directly interacts 
with interferon-activated JAK–STAT signalling.

Novel immunosuppressants
Despite the success of current immuno￾suppressive agents in reducing the incidence 
of acute cellular rejection, the toxicity asso￾ciated with these regimens has now become 
a major obstacle for positive long-term out￾comes of liver transplantation. Currently, 
novel agents, including small molecules, are 
at various stages of clinical development.86
These novel small molecules include the 
new generation ciclosporin A analogue, 
ISA247, the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibi￾tor, AEB071, and the selective Janus kinase 
inhibitor, CP‑690550.
Given the evidence for an important role 
of cyclophilins in the life cycle of HCV,12,15,16
investigation of the effects of ISA247 on 
HCV infection would be of particular inter￾est. ISA247 only differs from ciclosporin A 
by a single amino acid residue. The struc￾tural change induced by this substitution is 
considered to result in a greater calcineurin 
inhibitory potency and a more predict￾able pharmacokinetic profile than ciclo￾sporin A. An X‑ray crystal structure study 
has revealed the basis for the cyclophilin A 
binding affinity and immunosuppressive 
potency of ISA247.87 As cyclophilin A is 
a host factor that modulates infection of 
a number of viruses, it will be important 
to study the potential antiviral activity of 
ISA247 compared with ciclosporin A.
AEB071 is a small-molecule inhibitor 
that targets multiple members of the PKC 
family. PKC inhibition results in decreased 
T‑cell activation. Several members of the 
PKC family have been linked to both HCV 
infection and interferon signalling.88,89
Using cell culture models, however, no stim￾ulatory effect of AEB071 on HCV infection 
was observed; instead, at high drug concen￾trations a reduction in viral replication was 
found.90 This reduction might be related to 
inhibition of cell proliferation by AEB071. 
Therefore, it was concluded in this study 
that AEB071 had no direct effect on HCV 
infection.90 Further investigation is required 
to draw firm conclusions.
CP‑690550 was developed as a selective 
inhibitor of JAK3, which is predominantly 
expressed in immune cells and is only 
bound by γ-chain-bearing cytokine recep￾tors involved in the JAK–STAT signalling 
pathway.91 Some of the immunosuppressive 
mechanism of CP‑690550 can be explained 
as the result of IL‑2 inhibition, as JAK3 
functions in the receptor signalling pathway 
for this cytokine.92 However, CP‑690550 has 
also been shown to inhibit other members 
of the JAK family, including JAK1, JAK2 and 
TYK2.93 These pathways have considerable 
implications in both defence of virus infec￾tion and interferon responses. In addition, 
expression and activation of JAK3, which 
is involved in defence against dengue virus 
infection, have been reported in hepatic 
cells.94 Therefore, studying the effects 
and mechanisms of CP‑690550 on both 
HCV infection and interferon signalling 
would be highly relevant.
Conclusions
The development of subgenomic HCV 
cell culture models has greatly contributed 
to the discovery of the antiviral effects of 
ciclosporin A and MPA on viral repli￾cation. The use of a recently developed 
infectious culture model has revealed the 
negative effects of steroids, specifically on 
HCV entry.40 However, a common ques￾tion from transplant clinicians is why 
these clear in vitro effects of HCV are not 
univocally observed in clinical practice. 
For instance, the clear antiviral activity of 
ciclosporin A and MPA in vitro is yet to 
be confirmed in proper prospective clini￾cal studies, and retrospective data sketch a 
murky picture. One probable answer to this 
in vivo and in vitro discrepancy is that tam￾pering of the host immune system against 
the virus masks the direct antiviral effects 
of these immunosuppressive agents. The 
antiviral potency of particular immuno￾suppressants might not be strong enough 
to result in a dramatic effect on viral load, 
but could potentially be reflected in other 
parameters, such as slowing down fibrosis 
progression.95–98 Perhaps the potent effects 
of the derivates of ciclosporin A, such as 
Debio‑025, in patients were achieved by 
both deprivation of immunosuppressive 
properties and enhancement of cyclophilin 
binding affinity.34,35
A major new milestone for HCV treat￾ment is the approval of two protease 
inhibitors by the FDA in 2011. Although 
boceprevir and telaprevir are only approved 
in combination with PEG‑IFN‑α and riba￾virin for treating adults with chronic HCV 
genotype 1 infection who have compen￾sated liver disease, trials are expected to 
be designed to treat patients both before 
and after transplantation. As a caution, a 
phase I study found that telaprevir inter￾feres with the metabolism of both ciclo￾sporin A and tacrolimus by inhibition of 
cytochrome P450 3A enzymatic activity.99
Telaprevir caused a tremendous increase in 
blood concentrations of both these calci￾neurin inhibitors and could potentially 
lead to serious or even life-threatening 
adverse effects. Therefore, the interac￾tion of new antiviral compounds and 
immunosuppressants requires extensive 
studies of drug–drug interactions before 
designing any antiviral therapy trial in the 
post-transplantation setting.
In summary, progress in understanding 
HCV biology is important in evaluating 
the complex effects of immunosuppressive 
medication on HCV recurrence. Despite 
clear effects of ciclosporin A and MPA in 
HCV culture models, reliable clinical evi￾dence for their effect on HCV recurrence 
is still lacking. Inhibition of the immune 
response against HCV by immuno￾suppressants probably counteracts the 
direct antiviral effects. The effectiveness 
of interferon-based antiviral therapy is 
reduced after transplantation, but, to date, 
no concrete evidence from HCV culture 
models that immunosuppressive drugs 
interfere with interferon signal transduction 
exists. Immunosuppressive medication for 
transplant recipients who have HCV should 
be further improved. The application of 
newly registered anti-HCV compounds 
in transplant recipients should be care￾fully tested because of potential concerns 
regarding adverse drug–drug interactions 
with immunosuppressants.
Although basic science alone will never 
resolve the clinical debate, it already pro￾vides mechanistic insight into how par￾ticular immunosuppressants can affect the 
course of infection and outcomes of anti￾viral therapy. The knowledge gained in a 
liver-transplant setting will also definitely be 
a valuable reference for the management of 
patients who are HCV positive and receive a 
kidney transplant. Conceivably, these mech￾anistic understandings will promote future 
investment in the initiation of randomized, 
controlled studies and development of 
new-generation immunosuppressants for 
HCV-positive transplantation.
