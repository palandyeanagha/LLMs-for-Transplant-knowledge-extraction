Abstract
Micropuncture and morphologic studies were performed in
four groups of male Munich-Wistar rats after removal of the
right kidney and segmental infarction of two-thirds of the left
kidney. Groups 1 and 3 received no specific therapy. Groups
2 and 4 were treated with the angiotensin I converting enzyme
inhibitor, enalapril, 50 mg/liter of which was put in their
drinking water. All rats were fed standard chow. Groups 1 and
2 underwent micropuncture study 4 wk after renal ablation.
Untreated group 1 rats exhibited systemic hypertension and
elevation of the single nephron glomerular filtration rate
(SNGFR) due to high average values for the mean glomerular
transcapillary hydraulic pressure difference and glomerular
plasma flow rate. In group 2 rats, treatment with enalapril
prevented systemic hypertension and maintained the mean
glomerular transcapillary hydraulic pressure gradient at near￾normal levels without significantly compromising SNGFR and
the glomerular capillary plasma flow rate, as compared with
untreated group 1 rats. Groups 3 and 4 were studied 8 wk
after renal ablation. Untreated group 3 rats demonstrated
persistent systemic hypertension, progressive proteinuria, and
glomerular structural lesions, including mesangial expansion
and segmental sclerosis. In group 4 rats, treatment with
enalapril maintained systemic blood pressure at normal levels
over the 8-wk period and significantly limited the development
of proteinuria and glomerular lesions. These studies suggest
that control of glomerular hypertension effectively limits glo￾merular injury in rats with renal ablation, and further support
the view that glomerular hemodynamic changes mediate pro￾gressive renal injury when nephron number is reduced.
Introduction
The adaptive response to reduction of renal mass in the rat is
characterized by hyperfiltration in the remaining nephrons (1),
which results from elevations of the glomerular capillary

plasma flow rate and hydraulic pressure (2, 3). Recently, it has
been suggested that this glomerular hypertension and hyper￾perfusion may injure remaining glomeruli, and may thus be
responsible for the progressive azotemia, proteinuria, and
eventual glomerular sclerosis that follows extensive reduction
in renal mass (3, 4). Limitation of glomerular capillary pressures
and flows by dietary protein restriction has been shown to
slow the development of glomerular injury in rats with hyper￾filtration that resulted from 90% renal ablation and desoxy￾corticosterone-salt hypertension (3, 5).
Elevated systemic and glomerular pressures have been
associated with glomerular structural injury in "post-salt"
hypertensive rats (6, 7). In the rat with extensive renal ablation,
systemic hypertension develops early in the course (3, 8),
before extensive glomerular sclerosis can be demonstrated (3).
Reduction of systemic blood pressure with reserpine, hydro￾chlorothiazide, and hydralazine has been reported to afford
partial protection to remnant glomeruli (9), but the glomerular
hemodynamic consequences of systemic blood pressure reduc￾tion in this model have not been examined. In this study, we
sought to determine whether pharmacologic control of systemic
blood pressure following renal ablation in the rat would
effectively limit the adaptive increase in glomerular capillary
hydraulic pressure, and whether prevention of glomerular
capillary hypertension would slow the progression of hemo￾dynamically-mediated glomerular injury in the remnant kidney.
Methods
Four groups of male Munich-Wistar rats, with initial weights of 225-
245 g, were used in these studies. All rats were subjected to '/6 renal
ablation by removal of the right kidney and infarction of approximately
2/3 of the left kidney by ligation of two or three branches of the left
renal artery. All groups were fed standard rat chow (Wayne Rodent
Blox, Allied Mills, Chicago, IL), containing -24% protein by weight.
Groups 1 and 3 received no specific therapy. Groups 2 and 4 were
treated with the angiotensin I (AI)' converting enzyme inhibitor,
enalapril (Merck, Sharp & Dohme, West Point, PA), at a dose of 50
mg/liter in the drinking water that we began to administer 5-10 d
after ablation. Untreated group 1 rats (n = 7) and enalapril-treated
group 2 rats (n = 7) underwent micropuncture study 4 wk after
ablation. Groups 3 (n = 8) and 4 (n = 10) were followed for 8 wk
after ablation, at which time whole kidney and single nephron (SN)
glomerular filtration rate (GFR [also, SNGFR]) were determined, and
the remnant kidneys were perfusion-fixed for morphological exami￾nation.

Systolic blood pressure was measured weekly in all rats by the
awake tail cuff method (10). 24-h urinary protein excretion was
measured in groups 3 and 4 at 3, 6, and 8 wk after ablation. Effective
converting enzyme inhibition was confirmed by assessing the pressor
response to intravenous Al infusions in additional groups of rats. The
pressor response to increasing amounts of Al (25-200 ng) was measured
in intact rats (n = 5), intact rats treated with enalapril, 50 mg/liter in
the drinking water (n = 6), and rats with 5/6 nephrectomy, also treated
with enalapril (n = 4). The effect of enalapril treatment on plasma
renin concentration was determined in further groups of treated (n
= 6) and untreated (n = 6) rats, which were decapitated and whose
trunk blood was collected in EDTA 4 wk after renal ablation. For
comparison, plasma renin concentration was also measured in three
intact (two-kidney) rats fed standard chow, and in three intact rats fed
a sodium-deficient diet (ICN Nutritional Biochemicals, Cleveland, OH)
for 6 wk.
Micropuncture studies. For micropuncture study, rats were anes￾thetized with Inactin (100 mg/kg body weight i.p.), and placed on a
temperature-regulated micropuncture table. Immediately after the in￾duction of anesthesia, the left femoral artery was catheterized with PE￾50 polyethylene tubing, followed by a base-line collection of 210 Mtl of
arterial blood. This arterial catheter was used for subsequent periodic
blood sampling and estimation of mean arterial pressure (AP). AP was
monitored with an electronic transducer (model P23Db, Statham
Instruments Div., Gould Inc., Oxnard, CA) connected to a direct
writing recorder (Model 7702B, Hewlett-Packard Co., Palo Alto, CA).
After tracheostomy, polyethylene catheters were also inserted into the
left and right jugular veins for infusions of inulin and plasma.
Intravenous infusions of isoncotic rat plasma and 7% inulin solution
in 0.9% NaCI were started at rates of 6.0 and 1.2 ml/h, respectively.
The left kidney was then exposed by a subcostal incision and separated
from the adrenal gland and the surrounding perirenal fat. The left
ureter was catheterized with PE-10 tubing. The kidney was then
suspended on a Lucite holder, and its surface illuminated with a fiber￾optic light source and bathed with isotonic NaCl.
Since the plasma volume of rats prepared for micropuncture is
reduced by -20% (11), the following protocol for maintaining the
euvolemic state was employed. After insertion of the jugular catheters,
isoncotic rat plasma was infused over - 30 min, in a total amount
equal to 1% of body weight, followed by a reduction in infusion rate
to 0.41 ml/h for the remainder of each experiment to maintain the
base-line hematocrit (Hct) value obtained immediately after induction
of anesthesia.
Micropuncture measurements were carried out as follows. Exactly
timed (1-1.5-min) samples of tubule fluid were collected from surface
proximal convolutions of four to six nephrons for determination of
flow rate and inulin concentration, and calculation of SNGFR. Four
to eight samples of efferent arteriolar capillary blood were obtained for
determination of protein concentration. Coincident with these sample
collections, 140 Ml of femoral arterial blood were obtained in each
period for determination of Hct and plasma concentrations of protein
and inulin, and 15-20-min urine collections were obtained for deter￾mination of flow rate and inulin concentration. Time-averaged hydraulic
pressures were measured in surface glomerular capillaries, proximal
tubules, and efferent arterioles with a continuous recording, servo-null
micropipette transducer system (model 3; Instrumentation for Physiology
and Medicine, San Diego, CA). Hydraulic output from the servo
system was coupled electronically to a second channel of the Hewlett￾Packard recorder by means of a pressure transducer. Colloid osmotic
pressure of plasma entering and leaving glomerular capillaries was
estimated from values for protein concentration in femoral arterial
and surface efferent arteriolar plasma samples, by using the equation
derived by Deen et al. (12). Values for protein concentration, and thus
colloid osmotic pressure, for femoral arterial plasma are taken as
representative of values for these parameters for the afferent end of
the glomerular capillary network. These estimates of preglomerular
and postglomerular plasma protein concentration permit calculation
of single nephron filtration fraction, glomerular capillary ultrafiltration
coefficient (Kf), glomerular capillary plasma flow rate (QA), glomerular
and postglomerular blood flow rates and single afferent and efferent
arteriolar resistances, using equations described previously (12).
Morphology. Rats in groups 3 and 4, followed for 8 wk after
ablation, were prepared in similar fashion for micropuncture. Samples
of blood, urine, and proximal tubule fluid were obtained for measure￾ment of whole kidney and SNGFR, Hct, and plasma-urea-nitrogen
concentration, and the remnant kidneys were prepared for morphologic
examination. Kidneys were fixed by perfusion at the measured arterial
pressure with 1.25% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer (pH
7.4). After perfusion-fixation, one or two 3-4 mm thick coronal
sections through the mid portion of the remnant were postfixed in 4
g/100 ml buffered formaldehyde solution and processed for light
microscopy through paraffin embedding. Sections 3 Am in thickness
were stained with hematoxylin/eosin and by the periodic acid-Schiff
technique. The average glomerular tuft volume (VG) for each animal
was determined after the procedure described by Weibel (13). For this
purpose, the mean glomerular random cross-sectional area (AG) was
determined on 50 systematically sampled glomerular tuft profiles by
point counting at a final magnification of 200 using a 361-point ocular
grid covering a 369,664 gm2 microscopic field. VG was then calculated
as VG = (P/K) (A'G)32, where ft = 1.38 is the shape coefficient for spheres
(the idealized shape of glomeruli) and K = 1.1 is a size distribution
coefficient (13, 14). The frequency of focal and segmental glomerular
lesions was determined by examining all glomerular profiles (average,
119 profiles per animal) contained in one coronal section from each
animal. Segmental lesions were specifically defined as areas of the tuft
showing collapse of the glomerular capillaries, often accompanied by
hyaline deposition and/or adhesion of the tuft to Bowman's capsule.
For each animal, the number of glomeruli with segmental lesions was
expressed as a percentage of the total number of glomeruli counted.
Other glomerular changes, such as expansion of the mesangial areas
and abnormalities of arteries and arterioles, were assessed nonquanti￾tatively by light microscopy. Small, randomly selected fragments of
cortex were also processed by osmium postfixation and epoxy-resin
embedding. 1-Mm-thick epoxy-resin sections were stained with 1%
toluidine blue in 1% aqueous borax and examined by light microscopy,
for further delineation of glomerular lesions.
Analytical. The volume of fluid collected from individual proximal
tubules was estimated from the length of the fluid column in a constant
bore capillary tube of known internal diameter. The concentration of
inulin in tubule fluid was measured, usually in duplicate, by the
microfluorescence method of Vurek and Pegram (15). Inulin concen￾2251

trations in plasma and urine were determined by the macro-anthrone
method of Fuhr et al. (16). Protein concentrations in efferent arteriolar
and femoral arterial blood plasmas were determined, usually in duplicate,
using a fluorometric method developed by Viets et al. (17). Plasma￾urea-nitrogen concentration was measured using a Beckman Analyzer
2 (Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA). Urinary protein concentration
was measured by precipitation with 3% sulfosalicylic acid (18). Urinary
sodium concentration was determined by flame photometry. Plasma
renin concentration was determined by incubating 100 Ml of rat plasma
with 100 Ml rat anephric plasma and 400 Al of 0.2 M maleate buffer,
pH 6.0, at 37°C for I h. In treated rats with high renin levels, dilutions
were made using 10 Al rat plasma, 100 Ml rat anephric plasma, and
490 Ml maleate buffer. The generation of Al was then determined by
i-adioimmunoassay using commercially available reagents (New England
Nuclear, Boston, MA).
Statistical. Statistical analysis was performed by Student's t test for
comparisons between the means of two groups (19). Statistical signifi￾cance was defined as P < 0.05.
Results
Systemic blood pressure. In untreated rats, removal of 5/6 of
the renal mass resulted in the development of systemic hyper￾tension within 2 wk after ablation. As demonstrated in Fig. 1,
systolic blood pressure in group 3 rats averaged 169±7 (SE)
mmHg by the second week after ablation, and hypertension
was sustained throughout the observation period. Despite
equally extensive renal ablation, the development of systemic
hypertension was prevented in rats treated with enalapril.
Systolic blood pressure in these group 4 animals (Fig. 1) was
limited to - 130 mmHg, a level no higher than that obtained
in normal, intact rats in our laboratory (2, 5, 12, 20).
Micropuncture studies. Mean values for body weight, Hct,
plasma-urea-nitrogen concentration, whole kidney GFR, AP,
SNGFR, and the pressures, flows, and resistances governing
glomerular ultrafiltration for groups 1 and 2 are summarized
in Table I. Body weights were similar in the two groups. Hct
was slightly lower in the treated animals (P < 0.02). Mean
arterial pressure under anesthesia (AP) was markedly elevated
in untreated group 1 rats, averaging 151±6 mmHg, whereas
hypertension was absent in enalapril-treated group 2 rats, in
which AP averaged only 101±2 mmHg (P < 0.001). Despite
the lower renal perfusion pressure in the treated rats, values
for remnant kidney GFR did not differ significantly in the two
groups, averaging 0.91±0.04 ml/min in group 1 and 0.77±0.08
ml/min in group 2 (P> 0.05). Both groups of rats were
azotemic, with values of plasma-urea-nitrogen concentration
averaging 44±2 mg/100 ml in group 1 and 49±5 mg/100 ml
in group 2 (P > 0.05).
Single nephron hyperfiltration was evident in both groups,
with SNGFR values averaging 93.0±8.0 ni/min in group 1
and 81.6±7.4 nl/min in group 2 (P > 0.05). In the untreated
rats (group 1), in accord with previous hemodynamic studies
of rats with renal ablation (2, 3), hyperfiltration in the remnant
nephrons could be attributed to two factors. First, the glomer￾ular plasma flow rate, QA, was elevated on average to 324±26
nl/min, a value almost triple that seen in normal rats under
euvolemic conditions (20), due to marked reductions in afferent
and efferent arteriolar resistances. Second, the mean glomerular
transcapillary hydraulic pressure difference, AP, averaged 52±2
mmHg, a value considerably higher than that seen in normal
rats (20). This high average value for AP resulted from marked
elevation of the mean glomerular capillary hydraulic pressure,
PGC, which averaged 69±2 mmHg in the remnant glomeruli
(Table I). Values for proximal tubule and efferent arteriolar
hydraulic pressures were not different in the two groups.
Despite comparable reduction in renal mass, rats maintained
on antihypertensive therapy with enalapril (group 2) were
found to exhibit strikingly different glomerular hemodynamic
patterns from those seen in the untreated group 1 rats (Table
I). Values for SNGFR (81.6±7.4 nl/min), QA (334±43 nl/
min), and single nephron filtration fraction were not signifi￾cantly different in the treated animals. However, control of
systemic blood pressure was associated with prevention of
glomerular capillary hypertension, so that PGC (54±1 mmHg),
and therefore AP (35±1 mmHg), remained at levels comparable
to those seen in intact, two-kidney rats (20). Single nephron
hyperfiltration in the treated rats was therefore maintained
primarily by the elevated QA, but also by an increment in Kf.
Because all animals were in filtration pressure disequilibrium,
with values for rE/hAP < 1, unique values for Kfwere calculable.
In enalapril-treated rats, Kf averaged 0.0892±0.0159 nil
(s - mmHg), a value significantly higher than that observed in
untreated group 1 animals (0.0487±0.0043 nl/[s.mmHgJ) (P
< 0.05). Maintenance of the high glomerular plasma flow rate
in the treated rats despite the lower renal perfusion pressure
reflected marked arteriolar vasodilatation accompanying effec￾tive antihypertensive therapy with enalapril. Values for afferent
and total resistance to blood flow were significantly lower in
enalapril-treated than in untreated rats (Table I); the decline
in efferent arteriolar resistance was not significant statistically.

Values for afferent and efferent arteriolar protein concentration
and colloid osmotic pressure did not differ in the two groups.
Mean values for body weight, AP, Hct, GFR, SNGFR,
and plasma urea nitrogen concentration for groups 3 and 4
are summarized in Table II. Body weight gain over the 8-wk
course was comparable in the two groups. Mean arterial
pressure was markedly elevated in the untreated group 3 rats,
averaging 144±7 mmHg, while AP in the treated rats averaged
only 104±2 mmHg (P < 0.001). Again, despite the lower renal
perfusion pressure in the treated rats, average values for the
remnant kidney GFR and SNGFR were not significantly
different from those measured in the untreated rats.
Effectiveness of converting enzyme inhibition was confirmed
by assessing plasma renin concentrations and the pressor
response to Al infusions. Values for plasma renin concentration
in untreated rats subjected to S/6 nephrectomy averaged 5.4±1.4
ng AI/ml/h, a value similar to that measured in intact, two￾kidney rats (6.2±1.9 ng AI/ml/h) (P > 0.05) (Table III).
Inhibition of converting enzyme in rats with 5/6 nephrectomy
treated with enalapril resulted in a marked elevation of plasma
renin concentration to an average of 127.6±35.8 ng AI/ml/h
(P < 0.05 vs. all other groups). Treatment with enalapril also
markedly blunted the pressor response to infusion of exogenous
AI. At each dose of Al tested, the maximal rise in blood
pressure in enalapril-treated rats was no >35% of that seen in
untreated rats.2
Proteinuria. Exposure to sustained glomerular hypertension
in untreated rats was associated with glomerular injury, as
manifested by increasing levels of proteinuria. As demonstrated
in Fig. 2, untreated rats (group 3) excreted an average of 30±8
mg/24 h by the third week after ablation, and proteinuria
increased further throughout the observation period. With
only one-sixth the normal complement of glomeruli, remnant
kidneys in these animals excreted 66±8 mg/24 h by 8 wk after
ablation. In contrast, despite comparable ablation of renal
mass, control of systemic and glomerular hypertension in
enalapril-treated rats (group 4) was associated with considerably
less proteinuria at the initial determination (12±1 mg/24 h; P
< 0.05) and almost no increase in protein excretion thereafter.
2. Peak mean arterial pressure increments for the various doses of
Al were as follows: for 25 ng, 12±2, 3±1, and 4±1 mmHg for intact,
enalapril-treated intact, and enalapril-treated remnant kidney rats,
respectively; for 50 ng, 28±4, 6±1, and 5±1 mmHg; for 100 ng, 37±9,
12±2, and 12±1 mmHg; for 200 ng, 48±7, 17±3, and 17±2 mmHg.
By 8 wk after ablation, protein excretion in treated rats
averaged only 22±2 mg/24 h (P < 0.001).
Structural alterations. Morphologic studies confirmed that
limitation of proteinuria in the treated animals reflected pres￾ervation of glomerular structural integrity. In both groups, the
most prominent pathologic changes were observed in the
glomerular tufts. Glomeruli from untreated group 3 animals
displayed a wide range of morphologic abnormalities (Fig. 3).
Osmophilic droplets representing lysosomes containing reab￾sorbed protein were noted in epithelial cells. Vacuolization
and attenuation of the cytoplasm with bleb formation were
also apparent (Fig. 3 A). Segmental areas of collapsed capillaries
with accumulation of condensed hyaline material and adhesions
to Bowman's capsule (Fig. 3 B) were observed frequently. The
prevalence of these segmental lesions was significantly greater
in group 3. In untreated group 3 animals, with sustained
hypertension and heavy proteinuria, segmental lesions were
observed in 21.1±2.9% of glomeruli counted. Glomerular
injury was much less frequent in enalapril-treated group 4
animals, involving only 6.4±1.5% of glomeruli (P < 0.001).
Associated with these glomerular lesions were marked changes
in glomerular volumes. In untreated group 3 animals, the
average glomerular tuft volume (VG) was 2.143±0.149 X 106
,um3, a value more than triple that measured in kidneys from
intact animals in our laboratory (5). As is suggested by the
low power photomicrographs (Fig. 4), glomerular volumes in
enalapril-treated group 4 rats were significantly lower than
those in group 3, averaging 1.683±0.142 X 106 ,m3 (P
< 0.05). Extraglomerular lesions in both groups were limited
to occasional cast formation in thick ascending limbs of Henle,
and minimal interstitial inflammation. Prominent vascular
changes were not observed in either group.
Discussion
Removal of 5/6 of the renal mass resulted in sustained systemic
hypertension in untreated rats. While the mechanism of hy￾pertension associated with renal ablation remains unclear, it
is unlikely that stimulation of the renin-angiotensin system is
primarily responsible, since plasma renin concentration in
untreated animals in this study was within the normal range.
Our finding of normal renin concentration in untreated rats is
consistent with previous reports that subtotal nephrectomy in
the rat leads to plasma volume expansion (22) and suppression

of plasma renin (23). However, one cannot exclude the possi￾bility that there is a resetting of the sodium-volume renin
feedback mechanism, so that volume expansion does not fully
suppress renin release (24).
Treatment with the Al converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril
prevented the development of systemic hypertension in rats
subjected to reduction in renal mass. The sustained antihyper￾tensive effect of enalapril was confirmed by weekly systolic
blood pressure measurements in conscious animals, as well as
by the documentation of normal mean arterial pressure under
anesthesia at the time of micropuncture (at 4 and 8 wk
postablation). Neither diuretics nor sodium restriction were
required to initiate or to maintain the antihypertensive effect
of enalapril. Of note, the dose of enalapril used in this study
was considerably lower than that required to normalize blood
pressure in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (25, 26). The
efficacy of the lower dose in the present study may have been
due to impairment of renal excretion of the drug in the setting
of reduced GFR.
Control of systemic hypertension by therapy with enalapril
prevented glomerular capillary hypertension in the remnant
kidney. In the untreated animals, systemic hypertension and
arteriolar vasodilatation resulted in significant elevations of QA
and AP, which together were responsible for marked hyperfil￾tration in the remnant nephrons. In the treated animals,
normalization of systemic blood pressure resulted in reduction
of PGc and AP, without significant compromise of QA or
SNGFR. The QA was maintained despite reduction of AP
because of enhanced intrarenal vasodilatation. Thus, treatment
with enalapril resulted in values for afferent and total arteriolar
resistances that were even lower than those seen in the
vasodilated remnant kidneys of the untreated rats. Hyperfiltra￾tion in enalapril-treated rats was due largely to maintenance
of an elevated value for QA. Of note, an increase in Kf also
contributed to maintenance of SNGFR despite reduction of
renal perfusion pressure in enalapril-treated rats. This higher
Kf value in group 4 presumably reflects lesser capillary wall
damage. In addition, the rise in Kf may reflect inhibition of
the endogenous action of angiotensin II, which is known to
lower the glomerular capillary ultrafiltration coefficient under
certain circumstances (27). Alternatively, an inverse relationship
between AP and Kf has been demonstrated in an analysis of
the determinants of glomerular filtration (28). In enalapril￾treated animals, an augmentation of glomerular volume did
not appear to account for the rise in Kf, since the mean
glomerular tuft volume assessed in perfusion-fixed tissue was
in fact lower in treated than in untreated rats.
Prevention of glomerular capillary hypertension by enalapril
therapy was associated with slowing of glomerular functional
and structural deterioration, as manifested by lesser proteinuria
and fewer glomerular lesions in the treated group. The possi￾bility that the hyperfiltration (and/or the increased glomerular
pressures and flows determining the hyperfiltration) might be
the cause of the glomerular structural injury in this model has
been suggested by several previous studies (3, 29). Dietary
protein restriction has been shown to retard the development
of proteinuria and glomerular morphologic lesions in rats with
reduced renal mass (30-32). In micropuncture studies of rats
with extensive renal ablation, Hostetter et al. (3) related the
protective effect of dietary protein restriction on remnant
glomerular structure to near normalization of SNGFR, QA,
and AP in the remnant kidney. Subsequently, Dworkin et al.
(5) studied rats subjected to uninephrectomy and given weekly
injections of desoxycorticosterone pivilate and 1% saline to
drink. On a standard (24% protein) diet, these animals dem￾onstrated systemic hypertension with concomitant elevations
of SNGFR, QA, and AP. Proteinuria, glomerular hypertrophy,
and segmental structural lesions were evident within 2 wk. In
similarly prepared rats fed a low (6% casein) protein diet,
lowered values of AP were attended by lesser glomerular
structural injury.
Several important features differentiate the effects of ena￾lapril noted in the present study from those previously observed
with dietary protein restriction. Severe limitation of protein

intake results in retarded body growth (5), while enalapril￾treated rats in the current study maintained body growth rates
equivalent to those seen in untreated animals. Protein restriction
lowers systemic blood pressure in rats with desoxycorticoster￾one-salt hypertension (5, 33), but not in rats with renal ablation
(3, 31, 32). More important, enalapril therapy provided control
of glomerular capillary hypertension without significantly low￾ering remnant kidney and SN glomerular filtration rates.
Taken together, these observations suggest that elevation of
glomerular capillary hydraulic pressure may be an essential
hemodynamic derangement responsible for eventual glomerular
destruction in these models.
Studies in several other experimental models of hypertension
similarly suggest that renal hemodynamic alterations that
result in intraglomerular hypertension cause progressive glo￾merular injury. Azar and co-workers (6, 7) first demonstrated
an association between glomerular lesions and elevated glo￾merular capillary pressures and flows in rats with "post-salt"
hypertension. In contrast, early glomerular sclerosis is not
prominent in spontaneously hypertensive rats, which have
similarly elevated systemic pressures but more normal glomer￾ular capillary pressures and flows (34). Early proteinuria and
sclerosis in this strain are confined to juxtamedullary glomeruli
that have higher filtration rates and presumably higher pressures
and/or flows than those of the outer cortex (35, 36). In rats
with unilateral renal artery constriction, glomerular sclerotic
lesions develop in the unclipped kidney but not in the clipped
(nonhypertensive) kidney (37, 38). Micropuncture studies have
demonstrated that the unclipped kidney is exposed to aug￾mented glomerular capillary pressure and flows, whereas these
parameters are reduced in the clipped, "protected" kid￾ney (39).
Recent observations also suggest that glomerular hyperten￾sion may play an important role in the pathogenesis of the
glomerular injury seen in other forms of renal disease. Raij et
al. (40, 41) suggested that systemic hypertension in conjunction
with preglomerular afferent arteriolar vasodilation accelerates
glomerular injury in rats with ferritin-antiferritin immune
complex glomerulonephritis. In their studies, glomerular mor￾phologic injury was more severe in salt-sensitive Dahl hyper￾tensive rats than in spontaneously hypertensive rats or salt￾FM_AM .r

resistant Dahl rats, whose glomeruli are relatively protected
from high systemic pressures by afferent arteriolar vasocon￾striction (7). Similarly, reduction of glomerular capillary hy￾pertension may be the mechanism whereby antihypertensive
therapy retards glomerular injury in diabetic rats (42) and in
rats with experimental glomerulonephritis (43, 44). Indeed,
Zatz et al. (45) have recently demonstrated that pharmacologic
reduction of glomerular capillary hydraulic pressures with
enalapril limits albuminuria in the hyperfiltering kidneys of
normotensive rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes.
The current study raises two important questions concerning
the specific use of converting enzyme inhibitors. Since con￾verting enzyme inhibitors are capable of lowering systemic
blood pressure in many forms of human and experimental

moderate blood pressure control over periods of up to one
year have suggested that reduction of systemic blood pressure
may slow renal functional deterioration in patients with renal
insufficiency due to intrinsic renal disease or to essential
hypertension (51-53). Recent prospective studies of patients
with Type I diabetes mellitus offer further evidence that control
of systemic hypertension slows the progression of acquired
renal disease (54, 55). Our finding here, that control of systemic
and glomerular hypertension retards glomerular morphologic
injury when functioning nephron number is reduced, suggests
an explanation for the reported beneficial effect of antihyper￾tensive therapy in experimental and clinical renal disease, and
provides a rationale for the study of early and aggressive
control of blood pressure in the hypertensive patient with renal
disease.

hypertension through various pharmacologic effects (25, 46),
the mechanism whereby converting enzyme inhibition lowers
blood pressure in the setting of reduced renal mass remains
unclear. More important is the need to determine whether
other antihypertensive regimens, which have variable effects
on renal hemodynamics, afford equivalent reduction of glo￾merular as well as systemic pressures. Purkerson et al. (9)
found only a modest reduction in glomerular injury in rats
with renal ablation despite normalization of systemic blood
pressure with combination drug therapy (reserpine, hydro￾chlorothiazide, and hydralazine). Recently, Dworkin et al. (47)
have reported that antihypertensive therapy that controls sys￾temic hypertension but does not reduce glomerular capillary
hydraulic pressure, fails to protect rats with desoxycorticoster￾one-salt hypertension from glomerular structural injury.
Systemic hypertension develops in most patients with renal
insufficiency (48), just as it does in rats whose functioning
nephron number is reduced. While uncontrolled hypertension
hastens the decline in GFR that accompanies both normal
aging (49) and chronic renal disease (50), long-term studies of
the effect of strict blood pressure control on the progression of
renal disease remain to be performed. Studies evaluating

assistance.
