Abstract
Two young males with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD)
resulting from sarcoglycan deficiency died at 27 (patient 1) and 18
years (patient 2) of severe cardiomyopathy. Genetic analysis
showed that they were compound heterozygotes for mutations in
the β sarcoglycan gene. One of these mutations, an 8 bp duplication
in exon 3, was common to both patients. The second mutation in
patient 2 was a 4 bp deletion at the splice donor site of intron 2, not
reported previously. Patient 2 had more severe heart and skeletal
muscle defects with faster deterioration; no sarcoglycans were
detected in his skeletal muscle. The second mutation in patient 1,
inferred because the unaffected father carries the 8 bp duplication,
was not found. In patient 1, both heart and skeletal muscle were
analysed and showed reduction of all sarcoglycans in both tissues
and incorrect localisation of α and γ sarcoglycans in heart.
Therefore mutations in one sarcoglycan gene can disrupt the entire
sarcoglycan complex in both skeletal and cardiac muscle. Differing
expression patterns of sarcoglycan components in heart and skeletal
muscle could be the result of alternatively spliced transcripts in
these tissues. By sequencing an alternative transcript, highly
expressed in the heart and skeletal muscle of patient 1, we found an
87 bp cryptic exon not previously reported. Although
cardiomyopathy can result from mutations in α and γ sarcoglycans,
we show for the first time that the condition can also be caused by
mutations in the β sarcoglycan gene. This report therefore expands
the phenotype of sarcoglycanopathies and suggests that cardiac
function in LGMD patients with defective sarcoglycan expression
should be monitored.
