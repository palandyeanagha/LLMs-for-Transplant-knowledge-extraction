Joseph E. Murray
(1919–2012) 
First researcher to successfully transplant a human organ from a living donor.
J
oseph E. Murray performed the first 
successful human organ transplant from 
a living donor in December 1954. This 
feat, along with other transplants and his 
research on the use of irradiation and then 
drugs to prevent the rejection of introduced 
organs, ushered in a new era in medicine and 
won him a share of a Nobel prize in 1990. 
Murray died on 26 November at the 
Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, 
Massachusetts. He was born in 1919 in Mil￾ford, also in Massachusetts. After leaving 
high school, he went to the College of the 
Holy Cross in Worcester, where he received 
a bachelor’s degree in 1940, and then on to 
Harvard Medical School in Boston. 
He joined the army after a brief intern￾ship at the Peter Bent Brigham hospital 
(later called the Brigham and Women’s Hos￾pital), and was sent to Valley Forge Hospital 
in Pennsylvania. At the time, Valley Forge 
was dedicated to the care of injured soldiers 
returning from the Second World War. 
While at Valley Forge, Murray was involved 
in the treatment of burn victims. This often 
involved grafting skin — usually from the 
patients themselves, but sometimes from 
dead donors. Murray returned to Brigham to 
complete his general surgical residency after 
being discharged from the army in 1947. In 
1954, he was appointed to the hospital staff 
as a general and plastic surgeon. 
In the late 1940s and early 1950s, Brigham 
was a hive of activity in kidney transplanta￾tion. Two surgeons there, David Hume and 
Charles Hufnagel, had been transplanting 
kidneys in dogs. Hume had done several 
transplants using kidneys from deceased 
donors, and one of the introduced kidneys 
had survived for six months. Murray had 
been fascinated with transplantation since his 
work at Valley Forge, and when Hume was 
drafted during the Korean War, Murray took 
over the surgical laboratories at Brigham. 
While Murray was exploring ways to sup￾press people’s immune systems using treat￾ments that involved irradiating their entire 
bodies, a 23-year-old patient called Richard 
Herrick was admitted to Brigham for dialy￾sis, under the care of John Merrill. Richard 
was dying from chronic nephritis, a kidney 
disease. After Merrill learned that Richard 
had a twin, he, Murray and the hospital’s 
chief of urology, Hartwell Harrison, dis￾cussed the possibility (and ethics) of trans￾planting a kidney from Richard’s healthy 
brother, Ronald. 
Birth records confirmed that the twins 
had once been connected to the same 
placenta, and a skin graft from Ronald to 
Richard proved successful. Meanwhile, the 
Boston police department confirmed that 
the twins’ fingerprints were identical.
On 23 December 1954, Harrison and 
his team removed a kidney from Ronald. 
Murray then implanted it into Richard. The 
kidney functioned immediately. After Rich￾ard left the hospital, he married his nurse, 
fathered two children and lived in good 
health for eight years before dying from a 
recurrence of his original renal disease in 
the transplanted kidney.
In the years that followed, Murray did 
more transplants in identical twins. He hoped 
to establish a way to transfer organs between 
non-identical individuals and also did some 
kidney transplants using deceased donors, 
irradiating the patients’ bodies to suppress 
their immune system. With one exception, 
these early transplants failed, mainly because 
the irradiation slowed or stopped the bone 
marrow’s production of white blood cells, 
which in turn led to infection. 
Then in 1959, Robert Schwartz and 
William Dameshek, haematologists at the 
New England Medical Center (now Tufts 
Medical Center) in Boston, showed that 
an anticancer drug called 6-mercaptopu￾rine (6-MP), produced by Gertrude Elion 
and George Hitchings at the Wellcome 
Research Laboratories in New York, could 
prevent rabbits from producing antibodies 
in response to a foreign protein. The drug 
also prolonged the survival of foreign skin 
grafts between rabbits. Soon after this, Roy 
Calne, a young surgical trainee at London’s 
Royal Free Hospital, and Charles Zukoski 
and Hume, now chief of surgery at the Medi￾cal College of Virginia in Richmond, showed 
that 6-MP could prolong the survival of kid￾ney transplants in dogs. 
In 1960, just as Murray was planning to 
switch the focus of his lab work from irradia￾tion to 6-MP, Calne was awarded a Harkness 
Scholarship to join Murray’s laboratory at 
Brigham. By then, Elion and Hitchings had 
produced a derivative of 6-MP, called aza￾thioprine. They gave some to Calne, who 
had visited their lab on his way to Boston. 
Using azathioprine, Murray, Calne and 
other research fellows were able to dra￾matically improve the success of kidney 
transplants in dogs, and the field of organ 
transplantation exploded. The drug was 
first used in human kidney transplantation 
in 1963. 
Murray retired from the transplant 
programme in 1971. He remained chief of 
plastic surgery at the Brigham and Wom￾en’s hospital until 1986, and was also chief 
of plastic surgery at the Boston Children’s 
Hospital from 1972 to 1985. He corrected 
various craniofacial deformities in children, 
with some remarkably successful outcomes.
In 1990, Murray was awarded the Nobel 
Prize in Physiology or Medicine (along with 
Donnall Thomas) for his transplantation 
work. Among his numerous honours and 
awards, he was elected a member of the US 
National Academy of Sciences in 1993 and 
was a regent of the American College of Sur￾geons from 1970 to 1979. 
Joseph married his wife Bobby in 1945, 
and they had six children. He was a true gen￾tleman, and liked all outdoor activities. He 
was a very good athlete and a seriously good 
tennis player. ■
Peter Morris is emeritus Nuffield professor 
of surgery at the University of Oxford, 
founder of the Oxford Transplant Centre 
and director of the Centre for Evidence in 
Transplantation at the Royal College of 
Surgeons of England. He first met Murray 
in 1965 when he was a research fellow at the 
Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.
