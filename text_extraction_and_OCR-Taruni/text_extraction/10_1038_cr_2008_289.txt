Introduction
Nuclear receptors (NRs) are ligand-activated tran￾scription factors that have central roles in nearly every 
aspect of development and adult physiology [1]. This 
family contains 48 members in humans. Because of the 
importance of NR functions in different metabolic path￾ways, they have become attractive targets for drug dis￾covery.
Initially cloned and named as the farnesoid X recep￾tor (FXR, NR1H4) in 1995 [2], FXR belongs to a sub￾cluster of metabolic receptors that also include vitamin D 
receptor (VDR, NR1I1), constitutive androstane receptor 
Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand-activated transcription fac￾tors. As a metabolic regulator, FXR plays key roles in bile acid, cholesterol, lipid, and glucose metabolism. Therefore, 
FXR is a potential drug target for a number of metabolic disorders, especially those related to the metabolic syn￾drome. More recently, our group and others have extended the functions of FXR to more than metabolic regulation, 
which include anti-bacterial growth in intestine, liver regeneration, and hepatocarcinogenesis. These new findings 
suggest that FXR has much broader roles than previously thought, and also highlight FXR as a drug target for mul￾tiple diseases. This review summarizes the basic information of FXR but focuses on its new functions.

(CAR, NR1I3), pregnane X receptor (PXR, NR1I2), and 
liver X receptor alpha and beta (LXRα, NR1H3; LXRβ, 
NR1H2). As a transcription factor, it binds to DNA ei￾ther as a monomer or as a heterodimer with a common 
partner for NRs, retinoid X receptor (RXR, NR2B1), to 
regulate the expression of various genes involved in bile 
acid (BA), lipid, and glucose metabolisms [3]. FXR is 
highly expressed in the liver, intestine, kidney, and ad￾renals, but with lower expression in fat and heart [2, 4, 
5]. FXR protein has the typical NR structure composed 
of modular domains, the N-terminal ligand-independent 
transcriptional activation AF1 domain (AB), the DNA￾binding C-domain, a D domain and hinge region, and 
the C-terminal ligand-binding E domain containing the 
ligand-dependent AF2 activation domain [6-8]. There are 
two FXR genes (FXRα (NR1H4) and FXRβ (NR1H5)) 
in mammals [9]. FXRβ is a functional receptor in mice, 
rats, rabbits, and dogs, but constitutes a pseudogene in 
humans and primates [10]. The functional role of FXRβ
is not clear yet. A single FXRα gene encodes FXRα1 or 
α2 and FXRα3 or α4 isoforms resulting from the differ￾ential use of two promoters and an alternative splicing by 
using two different sites in exon 5 [5, 11, 12]. The four 
isoforms are expressed in a tissue-dependent manner [5]. 
FXRα is most abundantly expressed in the liver. FXRα1 
and FXRα2 are moderately expressed in ileum and adre￾nal gland. FXRα3 and FXRα4 are abundantly expressed 
in ileum, moderately in kidney, and at low levels in

stomach, duodenum, and jejunum [5]. By regulating the 
expression of genes involved in diverse metabolic path￾ways, FXR is becoming an attractive drug target for dif￾ferent metabolic diseases. More recently, we showed that 
FXR regulates liver regeneration, thereby linking BA 
signaling to liver re-growth [13]. In addition, FXR null 
mice spontaneously developed liver tumors as they aged 
[14, 15]. These new findings suggest that FXR has much

broader roles than previously thought.
In this review, we summarize the basic properties of 
FXR including its ligands and target genes, but focus on 
its new functions. Specifically, we will discuss the impact 
of these new findings on the studies of liver regeneration 
and hepatocarcinogenesis.
The ligands of FXR
Ligand identification for NRs always greatly facili￾tates their research. FXR was originally proposed to be 
a receptor for an intermediary metabolite, farnesol [2]. 
However, the supraphysiological concentrations required 
to activate FXR impede the use of farnesoid as a ligand. 
The major breakthrough in FXR biology was the discov￾ery that BAs are endogenous ligands for this NR [16-18]. 
In fact, both conjugated and unconjugated bile salts are 
able to activate FXR at physiological concentrations. The 
hydrophobic BA chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) is the 
most effective activator of FXR. Deoxycholic acid (DCA) 
and lithocholic acid (LCA) can both activate FXR, but 
to a much lesser extent than CDCA, whereas hydrophilic 
ursodeoxycholic (UDCA) and muricholic acids cannot 
activate FXR [17]. Recently, Deng et al. [19] and Wang 
et al. [20] reported that oxysterol 22(R)-hydroxycholes￾terol and androsterone are natural FXR ligands, respec￾tively (Table 1). However, whether they represent bona 
fide endogenous ligands of FXR and the physiological 
consequences of FXR activation by them remain to be 
established (Table 1). Some polyunsaturated fatty acids 
such as arachidonic acid and decosahexaenoic acid [21] 
and BA metabolites such as 26- or 25-hydroxylated bile 
alcohols [22] were also identified as weak FXR ligands. 
In addition, several synthetic FXR ligands have been 
generated. They include GW4064, 6ECDCA, AGN29 
[23], and AGN31 [23]. The most widely used FXR li￾gand is the non-steroidal isoxazole analog GW4064 
[24]. But the potential cell-toxic effect and uncertain 
bioavailability restrict its further use. Instead, 6α-ethyl￾chenodeoxycholic acid (6-ECDCA), a novel compound 
derived from the natural FXR ligand CDCA, has become 
an alternative agonist ligand for FXR [25-27].
FXR and its target genes
The function of FXR has been shown to be related to 
different diseases including cholestasis, diabetes, athero￾sclerosis, and cholesterol gallstone disease. A number 
of excellent reviews on roles of FXR in these diseases 
have been published recently [12, 28-31]. FXR fulfills its 
regulatory role by controlling the expression of a variety 
of genes in cognate metabolic pathways. Here we briefly 
summarize the identified FXR-binding elements and its 
target genes.
FXR regulates the expression of a wide variety of 
target genes by binding either as a monomer or as a het￾erodimer with RXR to FXR response elements (FXREs). 
Typical FXREs consist of an inverted repeat (IR) of the 
Figure 1 FXR regulates a large number of target genes involved in bile acid, lipoprotein and glucose metabolisms. FXR binds 
to DNA either as a heterodimer with RXR or as a monomer to regulate the expression of various genes.

canonical AGGTCA hexanucleotide core motif spaced 
by 0 bp (IR-0) [32] or 1 bp (IR-1) [33, 34]. IR-1 is the 
primary binding sequence for FXR. FXR regulates hu￾man intestinal bile acid binding protein (IBABP), small 
heterodimer partner (SHP), bile salt export pump (BSEP), 
BA-CoA:amino acid N-acetyltransferase (BAT) [35] 
and phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) via IR-1 ele￾ments in the promoters of these genes [36-39]. Besides 
IR-1, other FXREs include IR-0, direct repeat (DR), 
everted repeat [13] of the core motif separated by eight 
nucleotides (ER-8) and monomeric binding sites [32, 40-
43] (Table 1). In summary, FXR can bind to a variety of 
FXREs with varied affinities.
By binding to FXREs, FXR regulates many genes be￾longing to different metabolic pathways (Figure 1). Ac￾tivation of FXR alters the expression of different groups 
of genes involved in BA homoeostasis, lipid metabolism, 
and glucose balance. FXR is the primary sensor of BAs. 
FXR activates the expression of short heterodimer part￾ner (SHP), which in turn binds to and inactivates liver 
receptor homolog 1 (LRH-1, NR5A2), thus potently 
inhibiting the expression of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase 
(CYP7A1), the rate-limiting enzyme in BA biosynthesis 
[37, 44]. In addition, it is clear that BA activation of FXR 
in the intestine leads to the induction of mouse Fgf15 [45] 
or its human ortholog FGF19 [46], thereby suppressing 
CYP7A1 expression through a JNK-dependent signaling 
cascade. BAs are end products of cholesterol catabolism. 
As such, FXR also activates the expression of hepatic In￾sig-2, which represses cholesterol synthesis [47]. These 
findings indicate that FXR not only directly suppresses 
the synthesis of BAs, but also inhibits the synthesis of 
cholesterol, the precursor for BAs. A constant pool of 
BAs was maintained by enterohepatic circulation. In 
addition to regulating BA synthesis, FXR controls the 
recycling of BAs by regulating genes involved in BA 
secretion, transportation, absorption, conjugation, and 
detoxification [34, 42]. The remarkable ability of FXR to 
regulate BA metabolism is confirmed by loss-of-function 
studies on FXR in animal model [15, 48, 49]. Therefore, 
FXR is also called the BA receptor due to its master ef￾fect on BA homeostasis.
Analyses of FXR knockout animals also reveal an un￾expected role of FXR in lipid metabolism. It was shown 
that FXR also regulates a set of genes that participate in 
lipoprotein metabolism. These include genes for PLTP, 
SDC-1, the very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLD￾LR), apolipoprotein C-II, and apolipoprotein E [50-52]. 
All these genes are involved in the metabolism of plasma 
lipoproteins. In addition, activation of FXR leads to re￾pression of SREBP-1c, a transcription factor that controls 
genes involved in fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis [53, 
54]. Therefore, FXR plays an important role in regulat￾ing lipid metabolism.
Because of the intrinsic interaction between lipid 
and glucose metabolism, it was not surprising to find 
that FXR was also involved in the regulation of glucose 
levels. FXR regulates gene expression of phosphoenol￾pyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) [55], which is a key 
enzyme of the hepatic gluconeogenesis pathway, by cata￾lyzing a critical step in gluconeogenesis. However, re￾cent observations of glucose levels in FXR–/– mice have 
produced conflicting results. Glucose levels are shown 
to be unchanged [56], increased [57] or repressed [58] 
in FXR null mice compared to the wild-type littermates. 
This may be due to the different genetic backgrounds 
of experimental animals used or different experimental 
approaches. In contrast, two reports have provided con￾sistent results that activation of FXR in wild-type or dia￾betic [db/db or KKA-(y)] mice promotes hypoglycemia 
and increases insulin sensitivity [56, 57].
New functions of FXR
Recently, several new functions of FXR beyond its 
roles in metabolism were discovered. For example, 
activation of FXR induces the expression of several 
genes involved in enteroprotection, which may explain 
the previous observation that BAs can inhibit bacterial 
growth in the intestine [59, 60]. Because higher levels of 
BAs have been linked to human colon cancer, it will be 
interesting to know if FXR plays a role in colon carcino￾genesis. In addition, our group and others have identified 
novel functions of FXR in liver regeneration and hepato￾carcinogenesis.
FXR and liver regeneration
Liver regeneration after the loss of hepatic tissue is an 
important function of liver to repair injury. It is an adap￾tive response induced by specific external stimuli, and 
executed through subsequent sequential changes in gene 
expression, growth factor production, and morphologic 
reconstruction. Liver regeneration consists of several 
well-orchestrated phases, with rapid induction of pro￾liferative factors that activate the quiescent hepatocytes 
and prime their subsequent progression through the cell 
cycle, followed by re-establishment of normal liver size 
and renewed hepatocyte quiescence [6, 61]. Although 
many genes and signaling pathways are involved in 
liver regeneration, the essential circuitry required for 
this process is defined mainly by three major networks: 
cytokines, growth factors, and metabolic signaling [62]. 
Secretion of several growth factors and cytokines such 
as HGF, TGF-α, TNF-α, and IL-6 is an important early

response in liver regeneration. Activation of these potent 
signaling pathways increases expression of many down￾stream target genes via activation or induction of several 
transcription factors, including Stat3, NF-κB, AP-1, and 
c-Myc [61]. Compared to the cytokine and growth factor 
networks, little is known about the roles of metabolic sig￾nals in liver regeneration. It has been suggested that the 
increased metabolic demands on the residual hepatocytes 
after partial hepatectomy (PH) may be critical signals to 
activate the machinery specific for hepatocyte replica￾tion. Also, metabolic signals may function as a sensor 
that calibrates the regenerative response according to the 
body demands [62]. Therefore, identification of the key 
metabolic signaling pathways in liver regeneration will 
help us better understand the mechanism of this process 
and provide novel approaches to manipulate liver regen￾eration.
Normal liver regeneration is important for restoring 
the liver mass following liver injury. However, irregular 
regeneration of hepatocytes, which develops as a result 
of repeated cycles of necrosis and regeneration in chron￾ic hepatitis, has been reported as an important factor in 
hepatocarcinogenesis [63]. We will further discuss this 
issue later.
Previous reports indicate that 70% hepatectomy in￾creases BA flux and changes expression of several NRs 
and enzymes involved in BA metabolism [64-66]. We 
recently showed that normal liver regeneration is de￾pendent on and regulated by FXR [13]. Liver regenera￾tion was accelerated in mice in which BA pools were 
increased by feeding with a 0.2% cholic acid (CA) diet. 
In contrast, decreasing BA pool by feeding with a diet 
supplemented with the BA sequestering resin, cholestyr￾amine, strongly decreased the rate of liver regeneration. 
The effects of both CA and cholestyramine feeding on 
liver regeneration were absent in FXR–/– mice, suggest￾ing that FXR is the mediator of the effect of BA signal￾ing on liver regeneration. Furthermore, the rate of liver 
growth was much slower in the early stages of liver 
regeneration in FXR–/– mice. Activation of FXR by BAs 
increased the expression of a Forkhead Box transcription 
factor, FoxM1b, which was shown to regulate cell cycle 
progression during liver regeneration [67]. The results 
thus suggest that FXR is required for liver regeneration 
after damage possibly by regulating FoxM1b expression. 
However, whether FoxM1b is a direct target of FXR or 
indirectly regulated by FXR is still unknown. It is well 
known that FXR can activate FGF signaling in intestine, 
which consequently suppresses BA synthesis in liver [45, 
46]. However, the potential role of this FGF signaling 
axis in liver regeneration is still unclear. In addition, the 
relationship between the FXR-dependent BA signaling 
and cytokine or growth factor signaling pathways is also 
unclear. Nonetheless, the identification of a metabolic 
signaling pathway for liver regeneration suggests that 
releasing metabolic burden after liver injury could be a 
critical and integrated part of liver regeneration. It will be 
interesting in the future to further understand the impact 
of metabolic signals in liver regeneration. In addition, 
given the rapidly increasing demand of liver transplanta￾tion, targeting FXR pharmacologically may provide a 
novel approach to accelerate liver regeneration after liver 
transplantation or surgery.
We now have a more complete picture of FXR func￾tion in hepatoprotection. On the one hand, FXR controls 
the balance of liver metabolism, thereby preventing the 
deleterious effect of accumulation of toxic metabolic 
products in liver. On the other hand, once the liver has 
been subjected to injury, FXR will further participate 
in liver repair by promoting regeneration and helping 
restore organ homeostasis. This extraordinary power of 
hepatoprotection by FXR is essential for the maintenance 
of normal liver physiology and prevention of liver patho￾genesis. Indeed, in the absence of FXR, FXR–/– mice 
spontaneously developed liver tumors when they aged 
[14].
FXR and hepatocarcinogenesis
Liver cancer is one of the most common forms of 
cancer worldwide. In the United States, the incidence 
of liver cancer has doubled during the last two decades 
and liver cancer has become the most rapidly increasing 
form of cancer. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the 
primary liver tumor that accounts for more than 80% of 
all liver tumors. Among the major etiological causes of 
HCC, hepatitis B and hepatitis C infection, chemicals, 
alcoholic and nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases, and some 
metabolic genetic diseases including hemochromatosis 
and alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, have been implicated 
in liver cancer development, but the exact mechanism of 
hepatocarcinogenesis remains unknown [68, 69]. HCC 
is characteristically associated with the pathologically 
chronic liver diseases of hepatitis and cirrhosis, in which, 
triggered by chronic liver injury, hepatocytes proliferate 
continuously and at higher rates than normal liver cells. 
This uncontrolled proliferation or irregular liver regener￾ation is in contrast to normal liver regeneration, in which 
the liver resumes its normal size and stops cell prolifera￾tion within a short period of time. Therefore, irregular 
liver regeneration may constitute a common mechanism 
of hepatocarcinogenesis regardless of cancer etiology [35, 
63].
The development of cancer is a multi-step process. 
Recently, NF-κB and the inflammatory pathways have 

Farnesoid X receptor

npg

been shown to be involved in liver tumorigenesis [70]. 
In a chemical-induced hepatocarcinogenesis model, the 
role of NF-κB in hepatocyte protection is shown to be 
critical to prevent liver injury and the consequent ir￾regular liver regeneration [71-73]. In the absence of NF￾κB, the induced hepatocyte proliferation during irregular 
liver regeneration provides an HCC-promoting environ￾ment that favors the selection of transformed cells and 
promotes tumor formation. Similarly, several metabolic 
diseases have also been shown to result in chronic liver 
injury and irregular liver regeneration, thereby promoting 
hepatocarcinogenesis [68, 69, 74, 75]. These common 
pathological changes were also observed during hepato￾carcinogenesis in FXR–/– mice.
FXR–/– mice spontaneously developed liver tumors in￾cluding hepatocellular adenoma and carcinoma between 
13-15 months of age [14]. Both serum and liver BA lev￾els were significantly higher in FXR–/– mice compared 
to the wild-type controls. BAs have been implicated in 
the induction of liver apoptosis and injury [76]. BAs can 
promote liver tumors in a HBV transgenic mouse model 
and are thought to induce inflammation and liver tumori￾genesis in mdr-2 knockout mice [77-79]. This is now fur￾ther confirmed in our study as feeding of a cholic-acid￾diet promoted chemical-induced hepatocarcinogenesis 
[14].
In parallel, Kim et al. [15] reported very similar find￾ings that, at 12 months of age, both male and female 
FXR–/– mice had a high incidence of degenerative hepatic 
lesions, altered cell foci, and liver tumors including he￾patocellular adenoma, carcinoma, and hepatocholangio￾cellular carcinoma. The major findings between these 
two studies are very similar, especially the pathological 
changes of liver in FXR–/– mice including liver injury, 
irregular regeneration, and strong inflammation. These 
results suggest that FXR may provide an intriguing link 
between metabolic regulation and hepatocarcinogenesis. 
However, the mechanism by which FXR suppresses liver 
cancer remains to be investigated. The fact that FXR 
is required for both liver regeneration and protection 
against hepatocarcinogenesis suggests an intrinsic link 
between liver regeneration and hepatocarcinogenesis. We 
hypothesize that FXR has dual roles in helping the liver 
maintain normal homeostasis: one is by controlling the 
BA level in liver, the other is by promoting liver repair 
through regeneration (Figure 2). However, the FXR-de￾pendent liver regeneration is to prevent further liver in￾jury and proliferation. Therefore, FXR is rather working 
as a tumor suppressor. In the absence of FXR, the cycle 
of injury and compensatory liver regeneration (irregular 
liver regeneration) provides a tumor-prone environment. 
This is consistent with a recent report regarding the role 
of NF-κB in liver injury and hepatocarcinogenesis [70].
The precise roles of FXR in hepatocarcinogenesis 
need to be further defined. However, a potential contri￾bution of FXR in tumor suppression may be attributed to 
its anti-fibrosis function in liver [80, 81]. Chronic liver 
fibrosis has been linked to hepatocarcinogenesis when 
it finally develops into cirrhosis. Fiorucci et al. [80, 81] 
used a novel FXR ligand, 6-ECDCA, to demonstrate that 
activation of FXR in stellate cells inhibited pro-fibrosis 
gene expression in cooperation with two other NRs, Shp 
and PPARa.
The roles of FXR in carcinogenesis are not necessarily 
restricted to liver. FXR is expressed in non-enterohepatic 
tissues, including at high levels in the kidneys and ad￾renal gland, which are “non-classic” BA targets [4], and 
low levels in the heart, vascular tissue, thymus, ovary, 
spleen, testes, and adipose tissue [5, 82]. The functions of 
FXR in these non-enterohepatic tissues are poorly under￾stood, particularly in humans. It has been reported that 
FXR is expressed in human breast cancer tissues and cell 
lines [61,83]. Breast cancer is epidemiologically linked 
to high-fat diets and high levels of BAs in the body [84]. 
BAs are present at high concentrations in the plasma of 
postmenopausal women with breast cancer and in breast 
cysts. Swales et al. [83] showed that FXR activation by 
CDCA and GW4064 induced breast cancer cell apopto￾sis. In contrast, Journe et al. [61] showed that the FXR 
activator, farnesol, induced breast cancer cell growth.

We also found that FXR ligands CDCA and GW4064 
induced proliferation of MCF-7 breast cancer cells (un￾published data). Further studies are needed to understand 
FXR function in breast cancer cell growth and to deci￾pher the roles of FXR in breast cancer development.
Prospects
The function of FXR is expanded rapidly from initial 
roles in controlling metabolism to regulating cell growth 
and malignancy. The novel roles of FXR in promoting 
liver regeneration and protecting against hepatocar￾cinogenesis, however, are consistent with its previously 
defined functions in regulating BA metabolism and 
defending against BA toxicity. Therefore, we conclude 
that FXR is an important cell protector. We expect that 
further investigation of FXR function in these new areas 
will provide novel insights into the complex mechanism 
of liver regeneration and hepatocarcinogenesis.
