Abstract
Background: Primary and secondary aortopathy are frequently encountered in patients with congenital heart
disease. The aim of this study is to present our experience and the incidence of primary and secondary adult CHD￾associated aortopathy.
Methods: The cohort is comprised of adult patients with congenital heart disease from the registry of the Eastern
Slovakia Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases. Data from the last follow-up examinations are included in this study. In
the primary and secondary aortopathy groups were 35 and 12 patients respectively. As a control group were
selected 64 patients with non aortopathy associated congenital heart disease (atrial and ventricular septal defect).
Results: Patients with primary and secondary aortopathy had larger ascending aorta/aortic root diameters than the
control group (36.28 (26–49) mm vs 30.25 (21–41) mm p = 0.000113, 33.82 27–49) mm vs 29.03 (19–38)mm p =
0.000366 and 42.1 (30–50) mm vs 30.25 (21–41) mm, p = 0.000106, 35.67 (27–48) mm vs 29.03 (19–38) mm, p =
0.000119 respectively). Moreover, patients with secondary aortopathy had statistically significant larger ascending
aorta diameter compared to the patients with primary aortopathy (42.1 (30–50) mm vs 36.28 (26–49) mm p = 0.030).
During the follow-up period, were performed only in 2 patients (one from each group) operations on the aortic
root and the ascending aorta due to aortic root or ascending aorta dilatation.
Conclusion: More patients with secondary aortopathy had dilated ascending aorta/ aortic root, as well as larger
aortic diameters compare to the patients with primary aortopathy. Routine follow-up of these patients with
attention to aortic diameter is necessary.

Background
Dilatation of the aortic root and the ascending aorta is fre￾quently encountered in patients with congenital heart dis￾ease (CHD) at initial presentation and during follow-up.
Primary aortic dilatation is mainly associated with co￾arctation of the aorta (CoA), bicuspid aortic valve (BAV)
and conotruncal abnormalities such as tetralogy of Fallot
(TOF), pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect
(PA/VSD) or truncus arteriosus (TAC). The evolution of
the aortic size after birth will result from a combination
of intrinsic pathology, hemodynamic factors, associated
malformations, surgical or catheter interventions, and
control of risk factors later in life [1].
Secondary dilatation of the aortic root and to a lesser
extent of the ascending aorta, is seen after congenital
cardiac surgery, when the original aortic root is replaced
by a pulmonary autograft, as in the Ross procedure, or
modified as in the arterial switch operation (ASO) or in

systemic outflow tract reconstruction in single ventricle
(SV) patients. In these situations the neo-aortic root
consists mainly of pulmonary arterial root tissue intro￾duced in the high pressure left-sided system, often lead￾ing to dilatation in a time-dependent fashion [1].
The dilatation of the aorta or the neo-aortic root is
not a stand-alone characteristic, but needs to be
regarded as a part of the aorto-ventricular complex,
compromising the systemic ventricle, the aortic valve,
the aortic root, and the vascular wall. Each component
of this complex may by itself influence the other compo￾nents, thus introducing a dysfunction at multiple levels,
often defined as aortopathy [2].
CHD-associated aortopathy shows histological and func￾tional similarities like Marfan syndrome, such as degener￾ation of the aortic media (cystic medial necrosis) [3, 4].
The aim of this study is to present our experience and
the incidence of primary and secondary adult CHD￾associated aortopathy.
Methods
Patients and methods
This is a retrospective study and the cohort is com￾prised of adult patients with congenital heart disease
from the registry of the Eastern Slovakia Institute of
Cardiovascular Diseases and all the relevant data
were obtained from the medical records. Patients
with CHD at the age of 18 years old are included in
the adult CHD registry of the Eastern Slovakia Insti￾tute of Cardiovascular Diseases. In total 629 patients
with CHD are enrolled in this registry. The mean
follow-up duration of the entire cohort is 18,15
years. Regular annual follow-up examination with a
transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) of the ascend￾ing aorta and the aortic root was made in 127 pa￾tients. Data from the last follow-up examinations
which were done during the last year are included in
this study. The primary and secondary aortopathy
groups consisted of 47 patients in total, including 2
with CoA, 26 with BAV, 7 with TOF - (primary aor￾topathy group, 35 patients, which is 27,56% of all
regularly followed patients), 4 after a Ross procedure,
6 after an arterial switch operation due to transpos￾ition of the great arteries (TGA) and 2 after a Fon￾tan procedure - (secondary aortopathy group, 12
patients, which is 9,45% of all regularly followed pa￾tients). The control group was consisted of 64 pa￾tients with non aortopathy associated CHD (atrial
and ventricular septal defect). The diameter of the
aortic root and ascending aorta were measured by
TTE and all the evaluations were done according to
the standard techniques recommended by the Ameri￾can Society of Echocardiography [5]. The criteria for
intervention on the aortic root and ascending aorta
were according to the international guidelines and
recommendations [3].
An informed consent from the patients and approval
from the institutional review board were obtained in
order to present this study.
Statistical analysis
All variables were expressed as median and the qualita￾tive variables as numbers and percentages. A one-way
ANOVA and the Tukey’s range test paired were used to
compare the variables. A p value of less than 0.05 s was
considered statistically significant. The statistical ana￾lyses were performed using the StatSoft, Inc. (2007).

Results
The median age of the patients in the primary and sec￾ondary aortopathy and the control groups were 30.65
(18–60), 29.24 (18–44) and 36.35 (19–66) years old re￾spectively (Table 1).
Patients with primary and secondary aortopathy had
statistically significant larger aortic root diameter com￾pared to the control group (35.67 (27–48) mm vs 29.03
(19–38) mm, p < 0.001), and (33.82 (27–49) mm vs 29.03
(19–38) mm, p < 0.001) respectively (Fig. 1, Table 1).
Moreover, patients with secondary aortopathy had
also larger aortic root diameter than the patients with
primary aortopathy (35.67 (27–48) mm vs 33.82 (27–
49) mm p = 0.07), but with no statistical significance
(Fig. 1, Table 1).
Patients with secondary aortopathy had statistically
significant larger ascending aorta diameter compared to
the control group (42.10 (30–50) mm vs 30.25 (21–41)
mm, p < 0.001) as well as to the patients with primary
aortopathy (42.10 (30–50) mm vs 36.28 (26–49) mm,
p < 0.05) (Fig. 1, Table 1). Also, patients with primary
aortopathy had statistically significant larger ascending
aorta diameter compared to the control group (36.28
(26–49) mm vs 30.25 (21–41) mm, p < 0.001) (Fig. 1,
Table 1).
From the primary aortopathy group, 8 patients
(22.85%) had ascending aorta diameter between 35 and
40 mm and 9 patients (25.71%) > 40 mm, 7 patients
(20.00%) had aortic root diameter between 35 and 40
mm and 6 patients (17.14%) > 40 mm (Table 2).
From the secondary aortopathy group, 3 patients
(25.00%) had ascending aorta diameter between 35 and
40 mm, and 6 patients (50.00%) > 40 mm, 2 patients
(16.67%) had aortic root diameter between 35 and 40
mm and 4 patients (33.33%) > 40 mm (Table 2).
Nine patients (25.71%) from the primary aortopathy
group had undergone at least one prior operation. One
patient had a repair of CoA and later a reoperation due

to subvalvular aortic stenosis, 1 patient with BAV had
aortic valve replacement (AVR) and later a redo-AVR, 1
patient with BAV had replacement of the ascending
aorta due to aortic aneurysm, and 6 patients had repair
of TOF, where 3 of them had multiple reoperations.
All the patients in the secondary aortopathy group had
undergone at least one prior operation. Four patients
underwent a Ross procedure, where one of them later he
had reoperation and replacement of the neo-aorta due
to dilatation of the pulmonary homograft, 6 patients
underwent switch operation due to TGA, and 2 patients
had a Fontan procedure.
During the follow-up period, only 2 patients (one from
each group) were operated due to aortic root or ascend￾ing aorta dilatation. The rest of the patients are under
follow-up screening and so far they do not meet the in￾dications for any procedure on the aortic root and the
ascending aorta.
Discussion
Progressive proximal aortic (aortic root and ascending
aorta) dilatation is frequently found in adults with unre￾paired (primary aortopathy) or repaired (secondary aor￾topathy) CHD. In our study, in the primary aortopathy
group 25.71 and 17.14% of the patients had dilated as￾cending aorta and aortic root respectively. Similar results
are reported also by other authors. Steward et al. [6]
found dilated aortic root in 16%. There was a trend to a
more abnormally widened aorta in patients who had sur￾gery for repair of CoA later in life. Five of the patients in
their series with a history of hypertension that died from
aortic aneurysm rupture, had the original surgery at the
mean age of 19 years old. It is unclear if early repair of
CoA will always be able to prevent late aortic dilatation.
Even neonatal intervention does not prevent the occur￾rence of late hypertension, which by itself may trigger
aortic dilatation [7]. Biopsies studies of the aortic wall
found increased amount of collagen and a decreased
smooth muscle content in the pre-stenotic region [8]. In
our study, no patient after CoA repair needed interven￾tion on the aorta during the follow-up period due to
dilatation of the ascending aorta or the aortic root.
Concomitant aortic dilatation is seen in 80% of pa￾tients with BAV [9]. Studies showed that the dilatation
results from a combination of intrinsic aortic wall modi￾fications (genetic theory) and hemodynamic changes in￾duced by the bicuspid valve. The marked heterogenicity
of BAV disease leads to different phenotypes, resulting

in a large clinical variation of BAV patients [10, 11]. The
strong association of BAV with CoA may indicate that
BAV disease involves the ascending aorta and aortic arch
extending to the ligamentun arteriosum. Dilatation of
the ascending aorta occurs as a consequence of aortic
medial degeneration [12]. During the follow-up period
only one patient with BAV from our study group under￾went replacement of the ascending aorta due to aortic
aneurysm.
Dilatation of the proximal aorta is a common feature
in patients with unrepaired TOF. Corrective surgery has
dramatically improved long-term prognosis, and nearly
90% of the patients surviving well into adulthood [13].
However, persistent aortic root dilatation in increasingly
reported in adult patients, years after the corrective sur￾gery. In 1997 the first series of progressive aortic root
dilatation was published, where a substantial cohort de￾veloped subsequent aortic valve incompetence, necessi￾tating reoperation on the aortic root [14].
The underlying mechanism of the aortic dilatation in
TOF are both hemodynamic and intrinsic wall abnor￾malities like cystic medionecrosis as in Marfan syn￾drome. Presence of right to left shunt shunt, other
congenital anomalies, complete repair at older age and
even a genetic factor have been implicated in aortic dila￾tation in TOF [15–17]. In a homogenous cohort of TOF
repaired early in infancy, was found that the ascending
aortic size decreases with growth of the patient during
the first years after surgery, irrespective of the total hist￾ology score at surgery [18]. These findings support the
presumption that mitigation of the transaortic flow by
early surgical repair of TOF triggers a remodeling
process that may interrupt the progression of the limited
histological alterations of the aortic root, thus preventing
late aortic dilatation.
In a recent review by Mongeon et al. [19], in adult pa￾tients 35 years after repair of TOF at a mean of 7 years
of age, an aortic dimension of ≥40 mm was found in
29% and moderate to severe aortic regurgitation in 3.5%
of the patients. Only 3 cases of aortic dissection later
after TOF repair have been described, all in severely di￾lated aortas of ≥70 mm [1].
Moreover, in our study, in the secondary aortopathy
group, 50 and 33.30% of the patients had dilated ascend￾ing aorta and aortic root respectively.
After the Ross procedure, the neoaortic root dilates
mainly at the sinus portion and the sinotubular junction,
and less at the neo-aortic annulus itself. Dilatation oc￾curs rapidly within the first days after surgery, with a
further increase during the first year of follow-up, with￾out causing significant aortic regurgitation in the
medium phase term [20]. The postoperative distention
of the pulmonary autograft leads to remodeling of the
wall with intimal thickening, medial elastin fragmenta￾tion, hypertrophic smooth muscle cells and increased
medial and adventitial fibrosis [21]. Freedom from auto￾graft reoperation has been reported between 74 and 93%
at 10 years and between 65 to 82% at 15 years [1]. In our
study only one patient after the Ross procedure needed
reoperation due to pulmonary autograft dilatation dur￾ing the follow-up period.
In patients with TGA, after the arterial switch oper￾ation (ASO), the native pulmonary valve and root as￾sume the role of systemic arterial valve and root.
Progressive dilatation of the neo-aortic root exceeds
somatic growth during a long follow-up period. A di￾lated neoaortic root is seen in at least 50% of all pa￾tients after ASO [22]. Risk factors that are associated
with neo-aortic root dilatation after ASO include the
presence of a ventricular septal defect, previous pul￾monary artery banding, older age and surgical tech￾nical factors [1, 22, 23].
Also, adults patients with TGA after the atrial switch
operation have a greater incidence of dilatation of both
the pulmonary artery and aorta [24].
Freedom from aortic root reoperation was reported to
be between 83 and 97% after ASO [1], Moreover, only a
single case report of surgical repair of aneurysm of the
ascending aorta after atrial switch operation has been
described [25]. In our study group, no patient after ASO
or atrial switch operation needed reoperation on the as￾cending aorta.
Evidence of aortic dilatation has been reported in pa￾tients after the Fontan procedure. In a study with a me￾dian follow-up of 9 years neo-aortic root dilatation was
observed in 98% of the patients [26]. Histological ana￾lysis demonstrated findings seen in other forms of CHD￾associated aortopathies, such as fragmentation of elastic
fibers and deposition of myxoid material [27]. Aortic dis￾section in patients after the Fontan procedure was re￾ported in two patients with dilated aortic root [1]. In our
study group, no patient after the Fontan procedure
needed reoperation on the ascending aorta or the aortic
root.

One of the main finding of our study is that patients
with secondary aortopathy had larger ascending aorta
and aortic root dimensions than the patients with pri￾mary aortopathy. In the existing literature, so far there
are no studies with direct comparison of aortic dimen￾sions between the primary and secondary aortopathy. In
our opinion, secondary aortopathy in contrary to the pri￾mary aortopathy, the neo-aorta consists mainly of pul￾monary artery tissue introduced in the high pressure
left- sided system, often leading to more severe dilata￾tion in a time-dependent fashion than in the primary
aortopathy.
Regarding aortopathy-associated CHD other than
BAV, dissection risk is low [28]. Since, there are no spe￾cific guidelines recommendations [3], and no reports
suggesting high risk of aortic complications at neo-aortic
root/ascending aortic diameters < 55 mm, there is a
pragmatic attitude to these patients with a restrictive
policy following general aortic disease guidelines (55
mm) [3, 29]. On the other hand, because the time factor
is the principal determinant of late neo-aorta dilatation
and some cases of quickly progressive diameter increase
or fatal complications have been described, a close ob￾servation is warranted [3, 30]. In these patients, aortic
surgery was performed at lower aortic diameters, par￾ticularly if surgery was indicated for aortic valve dysfunc￾tion [28].
Regarding BAV the life risk of aortic dissection has
been reported to be 9 times higher than that of the gen￾eral population [1]. Moreover, Kuijpers JM et al. [28], re￾ported 10-year dissection incidence of 0.3%. This low
aortic-dissection risk in BAV is also reported in
population-based and post- AVR BAV cohorts [28].
Current guideline recommended aortic diameters
thresholds for prophylactic surgery in BAV is 55 mm or
50 mm with risk factors, and 45 mm at the time of AVR
for dysfunctional BAV [28]. Surgical treatment for as￾cending aortic dilatation in CoA may be considered
when the diameter is > 55 mm (> 27 mm/m2
) or if rapid
progression [31]. Moreover, the close association be￾tween BAV and CoA imply strategies established for
BAV may be appropriate [3].
In conclusion, progressive aortic root and/or as￾cending aorta dilatation is frequently found in adults
with repaired or unrepaired CHD. Primary aortopa￾thy is associated with BAV, CoA and conotruncal
abnormalities, where secondary aortopathy is after
congenital heart surgery, by which the original aotic
root/ ascending aorta is replaced by a pulmonary
autograft, as in Ross procedure or modified as in
ASO of Fontan procedure. It was observed that,
more patients with secondary aortopathy had dilated
ascending aorta and aortic root, as well as larger
aortic diameters compare to the patients with
primary aortopathy. Routine follow-up of these pa￾tients with attention to aortic diameter is necessary.
Conclusions
The incidence of primary and secondary aortopathy in
adults with CHD in our group of patients is 27,56% and
9,45% respectively. More patients with secondary aorto￾pathy had dilated ascending aorta/ aortic root, as well as
larger aortic diameters compare to the patients with pri￾mary aortopathy. Routine follow-up of these patients
with attention to aortic diameter is necessary.
