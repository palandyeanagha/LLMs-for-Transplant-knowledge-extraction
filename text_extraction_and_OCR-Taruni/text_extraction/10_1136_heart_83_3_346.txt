Abstract


OBJECTIVE To assess whether neopterin concentrations in women
with unstable angina differ from those in women with chronic
stable angina.
DESIGN Prospective cohort study.
SETTING University hospital in south west London.
PATIENTS 114 consecutive women with angina were studied: 82
had chronic stable angina (typical exertional chest pain, positive
exercise ECG testing, and/or abnormal myocardial scintigraphy;
symptoms stable for at least three months), and 32 had unstable
angina (Braunwald class III). All patients with chronic stable angina
(100%) and 18 with unstable angina (56.3%) underwent digital
coronary angiography; neopterin concentrations were determined
using a commercially available immunoassay.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Major clinical events during one
year follow up were readmission with Braunwald's class IIIb
unstable angina, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and cardiac death.
RESULTS Major events occurred in 12 women with chronic stable
angina (14.6%) and nine women with unstable angina (28.1%).
Mean (range) neopterin concentrations were significantly higher in
women with unstable angina than in those with chronic stable
angina (7.6 (5.1–11.5) nmol/l v 5.9 (4.4–7.5) nmol/l; p = 0.003),
even after adjustment for variables which were significantly
different on univariate analysis. In women with chronic stable
angina, baseline neopterin concentrations were higher in those with
cardiac events than in those without events (7.1 (5.9–9.1) nmol/l v
5.7 (3.9–7.3 nmol/l); p = 0.010), even after adjustment for
variables with significant differences between both groups on
univariate analysis.
CONCLUSIONS On average, women with unstable angina had
significantly higher neopterin concentrations than women with
chronic stable angina. Women with chronic stable angina with
events during follow up had higher neopterin concentrations than
those without events. Neopterin concentrations were similar in
patients with unstable angina and women with chronic stable
angina who developed events. Neopterin concentrations may


therefore be a marker of risk in women with coronary artery
disease.
