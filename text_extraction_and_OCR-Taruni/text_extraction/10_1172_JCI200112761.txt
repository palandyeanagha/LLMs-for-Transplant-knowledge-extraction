Introduction
Nitric oxide (NO) is a soluble gas that is continuously
synthesized in endothelial cells from the amino acid L￾arginine by the constitutive calcium and calmodulin￾dependent enzyme NO synthase and is a critical
endogenous vasodilator (1–4). The importance of
endothelium-derived NO in the regulation of coronary
and systemic vasodilator tone has been demonstrated
experimentally by inhibiting its regional synthesis.
Thus, NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA), which
competes with L-arginine as the substrate for NO syn￾thase but cannot be oxidized to form NO (5), decreases
coronary and systemic blood flow when infused intra￾arterially into regional vascular beds (6–9). Considerable
recent interest and controversy have focused on the role
of intravascular NO-derived molecules that conserve
and stabilize NO bioactivity and may contribute to
blood flow and oxygen delivery. Such molecules include
plasma low- and high-molecular-weight S-nitrosothiols
and nitrite (10, 11). In addition, NO reacts reversibly
with hemoglobin to form an NO-heme adduct, nitro￾syl(heme)hemoglobin, and can also nitrosate a surface
thiol on cysteine-93 of the β-globin chain to form S￾nitrosohemoglobin (SNO-Hb). The role of hemoglobin
as an NO transporter is particularly appealing in that
delivery of NO may be linked energetically to oxygen
binding, promoting the allosteric delivery of oxygen and
NO to regions with low oxygen tension (12–15).
The role of intravascular NO species in the regulation
of vascular tone is supported by studies of NO breath￾ing. Despite conventional wisdom that NO immedi￾ately reacts, with near-diffusion limited kinetics, with
oxyhemoglobin to form bioinactive nitrate, animal
studies have shown that NO breathing reduces sys￾temic vascular resistance (16), increases kidney filtra￾tion rates (17), increases aortic cyclic guanosine
monophosphate levels (18), and restores blood flow to
the intestine after infusion of a NO synthase inhibitor
(19, 20). While these observations are consistent with
intravascular biostabilization, transport, and delivery
of NO, the mechanism of such delivery and the rele￾vance to human physiology and therapeutics is
unknown. We therefore sought to determine whether
NO inhalation augments NO transport in blood and
increases blood flow in a regional vascular bed distant
from the lungs. We hypothesized that NO synthesis

Nitric oxide (NO) may be stabilized by binding to hemoglobin, by nitrosating thiol-containing plas￾ma molecules, or by conversion to nitrite, all reactions potentially preserving its bioactivity in blood.
Here we examined the contribution of blood-transported NO to regional vascular tone in humans
before and during NO inhalation. While breathing room air and then room air with NO at 80 parts
per million, forearm blood flow was measured in 16 subjects at rest and after blockade of forearm NO
synthesis with NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA) followed by forearm exercise stress. L-NMMA
reduced blood flow by 25% and increased resistance by 50%, an effect that was blocked by NO inhala￾tion. With NO inhalation, resistance was significantly lower during L-NMMA infusion, both at rest
and during repetitive hand-grip exercise. S-nitrosohemoglobin and plasma S-nitrosothiols did not
change with NO inhalation. Arterial nitrite levels increased by 11% and arterial nitrosyl(heme)hemo￾globin levels increased tenfold to the micromolar range, and both measures were consistently higher
in the arterial than in venous blood. S-nitrosohemoglobin levels were in the nanomolar range, with
no significant artery-to-vein gradients. These results indicate that inhaled NO during blockade of
regional NO synthesis can supply intravascular NO to maintain normal vascular function. This effect
may have application for the treatment of diseases characterized by endothelial dysfunction.

within the forearm endothelium would be sufficient to
maintain resting vascular tone, and thus NO delivery
from blood might be more readily appreciated during
regional inhibition of NO synthesis, pharmacological￾ly mimicking endothelial dysfunction. To determine
how NO is stabilized and delivered to the peripheral
vasculature, we measured all known bioactive NO
species, including low- and high-molecular-weight
plasma S-nitrosothiols, SNO-Hb, nitrosyl(heme)-
hemoglobin, and plasma nitrite.
Methods
The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review
Board of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute,
and informed consent was obtained from all volunteer
subjects. Eight men and eight women, with an average
age of 33 years (range 21–59 years), participated in the
study. Volunteers had a normal hemoglobin concen￾tration, and all were in excellent general health without
risk factors for endothelial dysfunction (smoking, fast￾ing blood sugar greater than 120 mg/dl, LDL choles￾terol greater than 130 mg/dL, blood pressure greater
than 140/80 mmHg). Subjects were placed on a nitrate￾restricted diet (<15 mg/day) for 3 days before the study
and fasted, except for water, after midnight of the study
day and during the study (diet described at
www.nhlbi.nih.gov/labs/7east/lowNdiet.htm).
Forearm blood flow measurements. Brachial artery and
antecubital vein catheters were placed in the arm, with
the intra-arterial catheter connected to a pressure trans￾ducer for blood pressure measurements and an infusion
pump delivering 5% dextrose in water at 0.5 ml/min.
After 20 minutes of rest, baseline arterial and venous
blood samples were obtained, and forearm blood flow
measurements were made by strain gauge venous-occlu￾sion plethysmography, as reported previously (8). A
series of seven blood flow measurements were averaged
for each blood flow determination. Forearm vascular
resistance was determined by dividing mean blood pres￾sure by forearm blood flow values. Intra-arterial L￾NMMA at 8 µmol/min then replaced 5% dextrose in
water at the same infusion rate of 0.5 ml/min. This
dosage was chosen because of our previous demonstra￾tion that vascular effects of L-NMMA in humans are
reproducible at this dosage when infusions are separat￾ed in time by approximately 1 hour (11). After 5 minutes
of intra-arterial L-NMMA, arterial and venous blood
samples were obtained and forearm blood flow was
measured. Forearm exercise was then initiated during
continued L-NMMA infusion, using a hand-grip
dynamometer, with one-third of the previously deter￾mined maximum grip strength sustained for 10 sec￾onds followed by relaxation for 5 seconds, in repetitive
cycles. After 5 minutes of exercise, arterial and venous
blood samples were obtained and forearm blood flow
was measured during continued exercise. Five percent
dextrose in water then replaced L-NMMA infusion into
the brachial artery. Inhaled NO was then delivered at 80
ppm by an anesthesia face mask with a reservoir bag
(INO Therapeutics Inc., Clinton, New Jersey, USA), with
continuous monitoring to assure oxygen delivery of
21%, as reported previously (15, 21). After 1 hour of NO
inhalation, arterial and venous samples and blood flow
measurements were obtained as described previously for
the measurements on room air.
Arterial and venous pH, pO2, and pCO2 were meas￾ured at the bedside using the i-STAT system (i-STAT
Corp., East Windsor, New Jersey, USA).
Methemoglobin concentration. Methemoglobin con￾centrations were measured by absorption spec￾troscopy at 700, 630, 576, and 560 nm using the Win￾terbourn relationship (22).
Hemoglobin preparation and ozone-based chemilumines￾cent detection of nitrosyl(heme)hemoglobin and S-nitrosohe￾moglobin. After measurement of methemoglobin con￾centration, pelleted red cell samples were lysed in
distilled water with 0.5 mM EDTA (1:2 dilution), and
200 µl of the hemoglobin lysate was added to 600 µl
of 0.2 M KCN/0.2 M K3FeIII(CN)6 with 0.5 mM EDTA
in PBS or to 600 µl of PBS with 0.5 mM EDTA and
incubated for 35 minutes. Treatment with 100-fold
molar excess of KCN and K3Fe(CN)6 selectively
removes NO from heme while preserving the S￾nitrosothiol bond (15). After the 35-minute incuba￾tion, 500 µl of the hemoglobin sample was passed

through an extensively washed (2-hour wash with 0.5
mM EDTA HPLC-grade water to remove column
preservatives), 9.5-ml bed volume Sephadex G25 col￾umn (17-0852-02; Amersham Pharmacia, Uppsala,
Sweden) to remove nitrite, small thiols, and the KCN/
K3FeIII(CN)6. The hemoglobin concentration of the
Sephadex G25 effluent was measured by conversion
to cyanomethemoglobin. Hemoglobin samples (200
µl) were reacted with I3
– to release NO for chemilumi￾nescent detection (15). The method for the measure￾ment of nitrite and S-nitrosothiols by reaction with
I3
– to release NO gas (21, 23) was applied to hemoglo￾bin that had been treated with and without KCN and
K3FeIII(CN)6. In brief, 7 ml of glacial acetic acid and 2
ml of distilled water were mixed with 50 mg of KI. A
crystal of I2 was added to yield a concentration of
6–20 mM.
(23). Helium was bubbled through the reac￾tion mixture, then through 1 N NaOH, and then into
the Sievers Model 280 NO analyzer (15, 21). The total
amount of SNO-Hb plus nitrosyl(heme)hemoglobin
was determined by directly adding hemoglobin sam￾ples to the I3
– solution without pretreatment with
KCN/ K3FeIII(CN)6. The background NO signal from
water collected from the washed G25 Sephadex col￾umn was subtracted from this signal.
SNO-Hb could be determined by first pretreating
hemoglobin samples with KCN/K3FeIII(CN)6, which
preserves SNO-Hb but removes NO from heme (15),
before addition to the I3
– solution. The quantity of
nitrosyl(heme)hemoglobin is therefore the difference in
amount of total SNO-Hb plus nitrosyl(heme)hemoglo￾bin, determined without pretreatment of KCN/
K3FeIII(CN)6, and SNO-Hb determined with KCN/
K3FeIII(CN)6 pretreatment. This value was divided by the
concentration of the hemoglobin, and the total
expressed as concentration in whole blood.
Ozone-based chemiluminescent determination of serum
nitrate, nitrite, and high-and low-molecular-weight S-nitrosoth￾iols. Blood samples were drawn into EDTA collection
tubes and centrifuged at 750 g for 5 minutes. Plasma
aliquots were removed and stored at –80°C until
assayed for nitrate, nitrite, and low-molecular-weight
S-nitrosothiols (LMW-SNO). These plasma samples
were later thawed, diluted 1:2 in 0.5 mM EDTA water,
and filtered through prewashed (four times with
nitrite-free water) 30,000 molecular-weight cut-off fil￾tration units. Samples were then injected in different
reductants in-line with the Sievers Model 280 NO ana￾lyzer. Nitrite was measured by reduction in acidified KI
(7 ml of glacial acetic acid, 2 ml of distilled water, 50 mg
of KI) (23). Nitrate was measured by reduction in vana￾dium (III) at 90°C (24). LMW-SNO was measured in
Cu+/L-cysteine, which does not release NO from nitrate
or nitrite (25). There is an approximately 25% loss of
LMW-SNO in plasma over 30 minutes, even in the pres￾ence of 0.5 mM EDTA, resulting in a measured limit of
sensitivity of the Cu+/L-cysteine–chemiluminescent
assay for S-nitrothiols in plasma of 25 nM. (Because
LMW-SNO was not detectable by our assay, we can
conclude that the levels of LMW-SNO in human plas￾ma are less than 25 nM.)
Because high-molecular-weight S-nitrosothiols
(HMW-SNO) are unstable in plasma, we immediately
analyzed plasma for this NO species. A 500-µl aliquot
of the unfrozen plasma was run on a 9.5-ml bed vol￾ume Sephadex G25 sizing column in a dark room with￾in 30 minutes of specimen collection. The 3- to 3.5-ml
elution volume containing plasma high-molecular￾weight proteins (albumin and immunoglobulins) was
collected, and 200 µl was reacted in I3
–. Injection of
samples into this I3
– reductant stoichiometrically pro￾duces NO from nitrosothiols (21, 23).

Statistical analysis. An a priori sample-size calculation
determined that 16 subjects would be necessary for the
study to detect a 25% improvement in forearm blood
flow during NO inhalation when forearm NO synthe￾sis had been inhibited by L-NMMA compared with
room air values (alpha = 0.05, power = 0.80). Two-sided
P values were calculated by paired t test for the pairwise
comparisons between baseline and L-NMMA infusion
values, between baseline and exercise values, and
between room air and NO inhalation values at compa￾rable time points of the study. Repeat measures
ANOVA was performed for artery-to-vein gradients of
NO species during basal, L-NMMA infusion, and exer￾cise conditions. Measurements shown are mean ± SEM.
Results
Forearm hemodynamics. L-NMMA infusion during room
air breathing significantly reduced forearm blood flow
(Figures 1a and Figure 2a) and increased forearm vas￾cular resistance (Figures 1b and Figure 2b) from base￾line values (both P < 0.001). This vasoconstrictor
response to L-NMMA was associated with significant
increases in the forearm artery-to-vein partial pressure
of oxygen (pO2) gradient (from 59 ± 4 to 64 ± 4 mmHg;
P = 0.044) and artery-to-vein pH gradient (from 0.029
± 0.008 to 0.051 ± 0.010 units; P = 0.031) due to reduc￾tion in venous pO2 (from 41 ± 4 to 35 ± 3 mmHg; P =
0.014) and pH (from 7.353 ± 0.008 to 7.338 ± 0.008
units; P = 0.084) levels from baseline (Figure 3). After
5 minutes of repetitive hand-grip exercise during con￾tinued L-NMMA infusion, blood flow increased near￾ly eightfold (Figure 1a and Figure 2c) and resistance
declined (Figure 1b and Figure 2d) from baseline val￾ues (both P < 0.001). This response was associated with
further widening of the artery-to-vein pO2 gradient (to
79 ± 2 mmHg; P < 0.001) and pH gradient (to 0.124 ±
0.012 units; P < 0.001) from baseline due to significant
reduction in venous pO2 (to 24 ± 1 mmHg; P < 0.001)
and pH (to 7.263 ± 0.011 units; P < 0.001) levels during
exercise (Figure 3).
After termination of exercise, L-NMMA infusion was
discontinued, 5% dextrose in water was resumed, and
inhalation of NO was initiated. After 1 hour of inhala￾tion, mean blood pressure tended to increase (from 80
to 85 mmHg; P = 0.067) compared with baseline meas￾urements on room air. NO inhalation did not signifi￾cantly alter blood flow from baseline room air values
(2.19 ± 0.24 vs. 2.56 ± 0.23 ml/min per 100 ml forearm
tissue, P = 0.083), and resistance values were similar
(32.5 ± 3.6 vs. 34.1 ± 3.1 mmHg/ml/min per 100 ml
forearm tissue; P = 0.652). The pO2 levels in the artery
(92 ± 2 vs. 100 ± 2 mmHg; P = 0.001) and vein (27 ± 2 vs.
41 ± 4 mmHg; P = 0.002) were significantly reduced
during NO breathing compared with room air values,
with a nonsignificant increase in the artery-to-vein pO2
gradient (66 ± 3 vs. 59 ± 4 mmHg; P = 0.115). NO
breathing did not change arterial pH (7.383 ± 0.007 vs.
7.382 ± 0.005 units; P = 0.910), venous pH (7.343 ±
0.007 vs. 7.353 ± 0.008 units; P = 0.151) or the artery-to￾vein pH gradient (0.039 ± 0.009 vs. 0.029 ± 0.008 units;
P = 0.272) compared with room air baseline values.
These results are consistent with minimal effects of
inhaled NO on basal blood flow in the arm, but an
increase in pulmonary blood shunting.
While there was minimal effect of NO inhalation on
baseline blood flow, the L-NMMA–induced decrease in
blood flow (Figure 1a and Figure 2a) and increase in
resistance (Figure 1b and Figure 2b) measured during
room air breathing were prevented by inhaled NO dur￾ing reinfusion of L-NMMA, resulting in lower absolute
resistance (Figure 1b). In contrast to the effect of L￾NMMA during room air breathing, there was no effect
of L-NMMA on artery-to-vein pO2 gradients (from 66
± 3 to 66 ± 4 mmHg; P = 0.889) and artery-to-vein pH
gradients (from 0.039 ± 0.009 to 0.057 ± 0.009 units; 
P = 0.132) compared with the baseline values after 1
hour of NO breathing.
During repetitive hand-grip exercise with continua￾tion of intra-arterial L-NMMA infusion and NO inhala￾tion, blood flow tended to increase to a greater extent
from the preceding baseline compared with the blood
flow response on room air (Figure 2c). The percentage
of change (decrease) in forearm vascular resistance with
exercise during NO inhalation was significantly greater
than the decrease in resistance on room air (Figure 2d)
and resulted in significantly lower absolute resistance

(Figure 1b). This increase in blood flow during NO
inhalation resulted in metabolic evidence of increased
oxygen delivery: The artery-to-vein pO2 gradient (76 ±
2 vs. 79 ± 2 mmHg; P = 0.162) and pCO2 gradient (–14
± 2 vs. –18 ± 2 mmHg; P = 0.096) during exercise with L￾NMMA infusion and NO inhalation tended to be less
than room air exercise values, with significantly lower
venous pCO2 (54 ± 2 vs. 58 ± 2 mmHg; P = 0.049) com￾pared with room air exercise values. The artery-to-vein
pH gradient during exercise and NO inhalation was
significantly less than room air exercise values (0.078 ±
0.015 vs. 0.124 ± 0.012 units, P < 0.001) due to signifi￾cantly higher venous pH during NO breathing (7.289 ±
0.012 vs. 7.263 ± 0.011 units; P = 0.013) (Figure 3).
NO species in blood. Consistent with the high affinity
of NO for the heme groups of hemoglobin and the
preponderance of oxyhemoglobin in the pulmonary
circulation, the primary reaction products during NO
inhalation were methemoglobin and nitrate (the by￾products of the reaction of NO and oxyhemoglobin).
Nitrate levels increased almost fourfold during NO
breathing (P < 0.001), but without significant artery￾to-vein gradients (Figure 4b). Methemoglobin levels,
converted to micromolar concentrations, were similar
to the nitrate concentrations: during room air breath￾ing, levels were 18.8 ± 2.4 µM, 18.8 ± 2.4 µM, and 18.1
± 2.3 µM at baseline during L-NMMA infusion and
subsequent exercise, respectively. During NO breath￾ing, levels were 106.3 ± 9.9 µM, 112.5 ± 10.0 µM, and
121.9 ± 10.1 µM at baseline, during L-NMMA infusion,
and subsequent exercise, respectively.
Forearm artery-to-vein gradients during room air
breathing were present for plasma nitrite (P < 0.001 by
ANOVA; Figure 4a) but not plasma nitrate (Figure 4b),
consistent with our previous studies (11). During NO
breathing, arterial nitrite levels increased by 11% to 868 ±
59 nM (P = 0.03), with artery-to-vein gradients observed
during all phases of the study (P < 0.001 by ANOVA).
Baseline HMW-SNO levels, measured immediately
upon sample collection in nine of the study subjects,
were nonsignificantly higher in the venous plasma than
the arterial plasma (35 ± 13 vs. 24 ± 9 nM, respectively;
P = 0.39) and did not significantly increase in venous (37
± 13 nM; P = 0.74)) or arterial (28 ± 10 nM; P = 0.85) plas￾ma with NO inhalation. Plasma LMW-SNO were not
detected either at baseline or during NO breathing.
We have reported previously that baseline arterial
levels of SNO-Hb and nitrosyl(heme)hemoglobin in
humans are 161 ± 42 nM and 150 ± 80 nM, respec￾tively, with no significant artery-to-vein gradients
(11, 15). In this study, these species were measured
only during NO breathing to allow for immediate
measurement without sample freezing (Figure 5, a
and b). SNO-Hb levels during NO breathing were not
significantly different from the previously reported
basal levels, and while trends toward artery-to-vein
gradients were measured, these did not achieve sta￾tistical significance (Figure 5a). In contrast, nitro￾syl(heme)-hemoglobin levels during NO breathing
rose approximately tenfold, compared with levels
determined previously by us in human subjects
breathing room air (15), to 860 ± 118 nM (P < 0.001
by nonpaired two-sided t test), and the arterial levels

rest, during L-NMMA infusion, and during exercise
(P < 0.001 by ANOVA; Figure 5b).
Discussion
NO inhalation has been shown to reduce pulmonary
vascular resistance in experimental models of lung injury
and to improve pulmonary hypertension and gas
exchange in patients after heart surgery and with acute
respiratory distress syndrome (26–29). These and
numerous other studies did not demonstrate systemic
blood pressure reduction during NO inhalation, sug￾gesting that the NO effect is local on the lung vascula￾ture, presumably because NO is inactivated by reaction
with oxyhemoglobin to form methemoglobin and
nitrate. Consistent with these findings, we saw minimal
effects of NO inhalation on forearm blood flow, vascu￾lar resistance, or blood pressure under physiological con￾ditions of local synthesis of NO by the endothelium of
the forearm vasculature. The absence of local vasodila￾tion in response to inhaled NO suggests that in healthy
vasculature, synthesis of NO by the endothelium masks
any contribution of intravascular-transported NO.
However, we found that when endothelial NO syn￾thesis was pharmacologically inhibited by an L-NMMA
infusion, inhaled NO exhibited potent vasoactive
effects, restoring blood flow and vascular resistance
toward basal levels. Furthermore, exercise performed
during forearm inhibition of endothelial NO synthesis
was associated with greater vasodilation during NO
breathing compared with room air breathing, with
metabolic evidence of improved tissue perfusion. This
finding suggests a significant contribution of NO to
exercise-induced vasodilation and is consistent with
the observation of reduced forearm blood flow with
forearm exercise after regional blockade of NO syn￾thase reported by Gilligan et al. (30). Accordingly, in
experimental (and potentially pathophysiological) con￾ditions associated with reduced regional endothelial
synthesis and release of NO, transport of NO from the
lungs to the peripheral circulation may assume physi￾ological importance. These data provide, to our knowl￾edge, the first evidence for the intravascular delivery of
bioactive NO species in humans and suggest that
inhaled NO may have application for the treatment of
diseases characterized by reduced regional NO pro￾duction, such as peripheral vascular disease and coro￾nary artery disease caused by atherosclerosis (8, 9, 31).
Because the effects of NO breathing on vasculature
constricted by other agonists (e.g., phenylephrine) with
regional NO synthesis intact was not determined in our
study, we cannot be certain that the vascular effects of
inhaled NO are specific to deficient regional NO syn￾thesis. However, a vasodilator effect of NO breathing in
vascular territories constricted by circulating or locally
synthesized agonists despite intact regional NO syn￾thesis could broaden the therapeutic potential of NO
inhalation and deserves further study.
These results are consistent with recent models of
intravascular biostabilization and delivery of NO
(10–15). While SNO-Hb levels are not significantly
higher during NO breathing compared with basal lev￾els, nitrosyl(heme)hemoglobin levels rose tenfold with
a significant artery-to-vein gradient, suggesting NO
metabolism and/or delivery. Additionally, arterial
nitrite levels increased, albeit to a lesser extent, with
significant artery-to-vein gradients. The observed
regional vasodilation during NO breathing when local
synthesis of NO was inhibited could therefore be
mediated by NO released by nitrosyl(heme)hemoglo￾bin, directly or via a SNO-Hb intermediate, or by
nitrite bioconversion to NO.
Consistent with the high affinity of NO for heme
groups (Ka of 107 M–1 s–1), our work suggests that dur￾ing NO breathing limited S-nitrosothiol formation
occurs while reactions with heme groups lead to large
increases in nitrosylated hemoglobin. However, in
sharp contrast with in vitro observations of the slow
off-rate of NO from hemoglobin iron groups (32), the
half-life of nitrosyl(heme)hemoglobin in vivo is con￾siderably less, with greater than 20% measured decrease
in the nitrosyl(heme)hemoglobin concentration from
artery to vein (approximately 10–30 seconds, assuming
60 seconds for red cell circulation). Such results could
be explained by rapid metabolism of the
nitrosyl(heme)hemoglobin to nitrate, release of NO
from heme to thiol groups (via intraerythrocytic glu￾tathione to form S-nitrosoglutathione or hemoglobin
β-chain cysteine-93 to form a SNO-Hb intermediate),
or via the release of NO directly from the heme group
of deoxygenated hemoglobin with diffusion in the
gaseous state to the vasculature.
From a biochemical standpoint, vasodilation medi￾ated by NO released from nitrosyl(heme)hemoglobin
is thought to be limited by the rapid reactions
between NO and both oxygenated and deoxygenated
hemoglobin. However, there exist mechanisms to
accelerate the release of NO from the heme group in
regions with low oxygen tension which exist even in
resting muscular tone. This release is possible because
in vivo, on average, only one NO molecule would be
expected to be bound to a hemoglobin tetramer
because of its very low concentration, with the
remaining heme groups carrying oxygen. With exten￾sive deoxygenation in regions of low oxygen tension,
the hemoglobin structural transition to the T state
would destabilize the remaining NO ligand. The dis￾sociation rate constants for NO are accelerated by at
least two orders of magnitude with the R-to-T transi￾tion [10–4 to 10–5 s–1 for R state (Hb4(O2)3NO) and 10–2
to 10–3 s–1 for T state (Hb4NO)] (32, 33). This rate is
further accelerated by heterotropic effectors, such as
protons and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate, with dissocia￾tion accelerating to seconds (34, 35).
Assuming a dissociation constant of 0.01, the half￾life of nitrosyl(heme)hemoglobin would be approxi￾mately 60 seconds, potentially allowing significant

Figure 6
A model of the mechanism of vascular transport of bioactive NO by red cells and plasma during NO inhalation (based on refs. 11–15). (a)
During NO inhalation, NO and oxygen in the pulmonary vasculature react to form nitrite (NO2
–). NO also binds to deoxyheme groups of
hemoglobin to form nitrosyl(heme)hemoglobin (FeII-NO) and possibly with oxyhemoglobin β-globin cysteine-93 to form S-nitrosohemo￾globin (β-cys93-S-NO). The major reaction of NO with oxyhemoglobin to form methemoglobin and nitrate (NO3
–) is not shown here but
accounts for the rise of methemoglobin from approximately 0.2% to 1% during NO inhalation. (b) In the partially deoxygenated red cell some
NO of nitrosyl(heme)hemoglobin will react with oxygen or with oxyhemoglobin to form nitrate and methemoglobin. (c) When hemoglobin
saturation and tissue pO2 are very low, these reactions are significantly reduced and NO release from the red cell becomes possible. The
hemoglobin structural transition from the oxy-state (R) to the deoxy-state (T) destabilizes the remaining NO ligand. This rate is further accel￾erated by heterotropic effectors, such as protons and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate, and requires a high-affinity acceptor for NO. It is possible
that transfer of NO (NO+) from heme to the hemoglobin β-chain cysteine-93 occurs to form a S-nitrosohemoglobin intermediate that then
releases NO by transnitrosation with glutathione (GSH). In addition, plasma nitrite may be converted to NO by disproportionation or by
metal- or enzyme-catalyzed (xanthine oxidoreductase) processes. Finally, plasma S-nitrosothiol proteins could bind and deliver NO. Most
of these pathways will occur preferentially in regions with low O2 tension and pH, resulting in delivery of NO to these sites.
dissociation of NO in the 10- to 30-second circulato￾ry time from artery to vein. The biochemical fate of
the NO released depends critically on it not reacting
with oxyhemoglobin to form bioinactive nitrate.
When hemoglobin saturation and tissue pO2 are low
(10–25% oxyhemoglobin saturation and tissue pO2 of
0–14 mmHg in metabolizing tissue (36, 37), these
reactions are significantly reduced, and NO release
from the red cell becomes possible. This release
requires a high-affinity acceptor; however, potential
high-affinity acceptors are ubiquitous in endotheli￾um (soluble guanylyl cyclase), smooth and striated
muscle (myoglobin), and brain (neuroglobin). Even if
less than 1% of our observed artery-to-vein gradients
in nitrosyl(heme)-hemoglobin during NO breathing
(176, 468, and 340 nM NO at baseline, L-NMMA and
exercise, respectively) were released and escaped reac￾tion with oxygen and oxyhemoglobin, this would
result in vasodilation. In this regard, the concentra￾tion of NO required to achieve 50% relaxation of aor￾tic ring bioassays (EC50) is approximately 5 nM (38).
Furthermore, L-NMMA treatment (and eNOS knock￾out) potentiates the sensitivity of soluble guanylyl
cyclase to NO, resulting in an EC50 of less than 1 nM
NO concentration.
Our observed artery-to-vein gradients in
nitrosyl(heme)hemoglobin during NO breathing and
the associated blood flow effects suggest the possibili￾ty that other high-affinity ligands may be delivered by
hemoglobin. In fact, carbon monoxide (CO) exists
bound to hemoglobin in concentrations of 0.3–1 % (30
µM to 100 µM) and has been found to participate in
blood flow regulation and cell-signaling pathways,
with distal effects observed during CO inhalation
The Journal of Clinical Investigation | July 2001 | Volume 108 | Number 2 285

(39–41). Published data suggest that direct allosteric
(oxygen-linked) release of CO from hemoglobin during
regional hypoxia (42) and exercise (43, 44) occurs and
is consistent with CO delivery from hemoglobin. These
experiments further support the notion that high￾affinity gas ligands, including NO, may be released
from hemoglobin to the tissues, particularly in hypox￾ic or relatively acidic vascular beds.
We did not observe an increase in HMW-SNO (SNO￾albumin) during NO breathing, suggesting that plas￾ma SNO compounds do not mediate the observed
blood flow effect. However, recent data suggest that the
SNO-albumin is unstable in plasma due to its break￾down in the presence of low-molecular-weight thiols
(45). While the rapid separation of the albumin from
the low-molecular-weight thiol pool (as we did in this
study) will conserve the HMW-SNO, it remains possi￾ble that an increase in HMW-SNO did occur during
NO breathing that we failed to detect. Newer method￾ologies to preserve plasma S-nitrosothiols are required
to answer this question.
While the nitrite concentration only increased by
approximately 90 nM, such a sustained increase over
1 hour could also potentially contribute to the
peripheral effects of NO inhalation. Unlike nitrate,
which is thought to be a biologically inactive end￾product of NO reactions with oxyhemoglobin, recent
data suggest that nitrite remains bioactive. We have
reported recently baseline arterial-venous nitrite gra￾dients in normal human volunteers, providing a
potential delivery source for intravascularly produced
NO (11). Under physiologic levels of acidity, nitrite
forms nitrous acid, which can react with nitrite again
to form N2O3. This reactive nitrogen species can
nitrosate thiols (which are vasoactive) or in the pres￾ence of an electron donor produce NO (46). NO gen￾eration has been documented in ischemic myocardi￾um; this requires low tissue pH, tissue reductants,
and/or nitrite disproportionation (47, 48). Alterna￾tively, this conversion could be metal or enzyme cat￾alyzed. For example, recent studies suggest that xan￾thine oxidoreductase, which is present in abundance
in vascular endothelium, may reduce nitrite to NO,
an effect that increases with decreasing pH, increas￾ing NADH concentration, and hypoxia (49–51). By
either mechanism, under acidic conditions poten￾tially associated with stress such as reduced blood
flow or exercise, the conversion of nitrite to NO
could also potentially augment regional blood flow
and oxygen delivery. Further experimental work in
animal models and in humans will be required to
determine the biological relevance of these potential
mechanisms. A schematic model of these proposed
mechanisms for red cell and plasma transport of NO
is shown in Figure 6.
In recent years, there has been increasing evidence for
depressed bioavailability of NO in syndromes associat￾ed with atherosclerosis and its risk factors, with defects
in both basal and pharmacologically stimulated
endothelial NO production reported (8, 9, 31). Our
observation that NO inhalation results in peripheral
vasodilation targeted to regions with pharmacologi￾cally reduced NO production may have therapeutic
applications in diseases characterized by regional NO
deficiency. The most fundamental and important
observation of this study is that NO gas introduced to
the lungs can be stabilized and transported in blood
and peripherally modulate blood flow.
