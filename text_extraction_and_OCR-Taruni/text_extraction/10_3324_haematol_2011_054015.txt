Introduction
Infections are an important cause of morbidity and the
leading cause of death in patients with multiple myeloma
(MM).
1 Recently, much attention has been drawn to the
changing spectrum of infections in MM, possibly related to
the more intensive treatment and new classes of therapeutic
agents of recent years.
2-4
According to recent studies, MM is always preceded by
monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance
(MGUS).
5 While patients with MGUS are asymptomatic,
they have increased morbidity and mortality compared to the
general population.
6-8 The risk of infections among patients
with MGUS has not been studied in great detail. Gregersen et
al. analyzed risk of bacteremia in 1,237 MGUS patients in
Denmark diagnosed from 1981 to 1993.
9 Based on 40
episodes of bacteremia, there was a 2.2-fold increase in risk
compared to the general population. In another study based
on screening data from Olmsted County in Minnesota, risks
of several different diseases, including some infectious disor￾ders, were analyzed among 605 MGUS patients and com￾pared to 16,793 controls.
8 An increased risk of upper respira￾tory bacterial infection, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and
mycobacterium infection was found. We previously showed
that MGUS patients had a higher mortality compared to
matched controls that was explained by the increased risk of
several different causes of death, including infections.
6 In
addition, there have been some smaller series and case
reports on associations between MGUS and selected infec￾tions.
10-12 To our knowledge, there has been no systematic
analysis of the risk of a broad span of bacterial and viral infec￾tions in a large population-based cohort of MGUS patients.
Using high-quality population-based data from Sweden,
we assessed the risk of bacterial and viral infections and indi￾Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and risk of infections:

No comprehensive evaluation has been made to assess the risk
of viral and bacterial infections among patients with mono￾clonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. Using pop￾ulation-based data from Sweden, we estimated risk of infec￾tions among 5,326 monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined
significance patients compared to 20,161 matched controls.
Patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined sig￾nificance had a 2-fold increased risk (P<0.05) of developing
any infection at 5- and 10-year follow up. More specifically,
patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined sig￾nificance had an increased risk (P<0.05) of bacterial (pneumo￾nia, osteomyelitis, septicemia, pyelonephritis, cellulitis, endo￾carditis, and meningitis), and viral (influenza and herpes
zoster) infections. Patients with monoclonal gammopathy of
undetermined significance with M-protein concentrations
over 2.5 g/dL at diagnosis had highest risks of infections.
However, the risk was also increased (P<0.05) among those
with concentrations below 0.5 g/dL. Patients with monoclonal
gammopathy of undetermined significance who developed
infections had no excess risk of developing multiple myeloma,
Waldenström macroglobulinemia or related malignancy. Our
findings provide novel insights into the mechanisms behind
infections in patients with plasma cell dyscrasias, and may
have clinical implications.

ABSTRACT

vidual infections in 5,326 MGUS patients compared to
20,161 population-based matched controls.
Design and Methods
The details of the study population have been described previ￾ously.
13 We established a nationwide MGUS cohort from a nation￾al hospital network including MGUS patients diagnosed in
Sweden between 1965 and 2005. All available information on
MGUS subtype and concentration of the M-protein at diagnosis
was included in the dataset. To minimize the influence of a poten￾tially undetected lymphoproliferative malignancy, MGUS patients
who were diagnosed with a lymphoproliferative malignancy
within six months of MGUS diagnosis were excluded from the
analysis. For each MGUS patient, 4 population-based controls
(matched by sex, year of birth, and county of residence) were cho￾sen randomly from the Swedish Population database. All controls
had to be alive and free of any preceding hematologic malignancy
at the time of MGUS diagnosis for the corresponding case.
Information on occurrence and date of infections was obtained
from the centralized Swedish Patient Registry that captures infor￾mation on individual patient-based discharge diagnoses and dis￾charge listings from inpatient (since 1964, with very high coverage
from 1987) and outpatient (since 2000) care. Through linkage with
the Cause of Death Register and the Register of Total Population,
we collected information on vital status until December 31, 2006.
Cox's proportional hazard models (adjusted for sex, age at diag￾nosis and year of diagnosis) were used to compare 5- and 10-year
risks of infections in MGUS patients compared to controls. Follow
up started at age at diagnosis of MGUS (age at registration for con￾trols) or January 1, 1987, if MGUS was diagnosed before that date.
Censoring events were death, emigration, the end of acquisition
period or diagnosis of a lymphoproliferative disorder. We exclud￾ed all infections occurring in the first six months from MGUS diag￾nosis (date of selection for controls). For sensitivity analyses, we
excluded infections occurring within 12 months of MM diagnosis.
The results were essentially the same.
Approval was obtained from the Karolinska Institutional
Review Board (IRB) for this study. Informed consent was waived
because we had no contact with study subjects. An exemption
from IRB review was obtained from the National Institutes of
Health Office of Human Subjects Research because we used exist￾ing data without personal identifiers.
Results and Discussion
A total of 5,326 MGUS patients and 20,161 matched
population-based controls were included in this study
(Table 1). The median age at diagnosis was 71 years, and
50% of patients were male. The MGUS isotype was avail￾able in 61% of patients, and was IgG, IgA, and IgM in
40%, 11%, and 10% of patients, respectively. Information
on the M-protein concentration at diagnosis was available
in 53% of patients; of these 60% had a value above and
40% below 1.0 g/dL.
A total of 377 MGUS patients (7.1%) and 550 controls
(2.7%) were diagnosed with more than one infection. The
average number of infections per MGUS patient was 0.34
and 0.17 per control. Median time from MGUS diagnosis
to first infection was 1,928 days.
At 5-year follow up, compared to controls, MGUS
patients had a 2.1-fold (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.0-
2.3) increased risk of developing any infection; at 10-year
follow up, the risk was very similar (hazard ratio
(HR)=2.2; 95% CI 2.0-2.3; Table 2). We further found
MGUS patients to have a 2.1-fold (95% CI 1.9-2.3) and a
2.2-fold (95% CI 2.0-2.4) increased risk of developing bac￾terial infections at five and ten years, respectively. When
we assessed risks of individual bacterial infections, at 10-
year follow up, we found an increased risk of pneumonia
(HR=2.4; 95% CI 2.2-2.6), osteomyelitis (HR=3.3; 95% CI
2.1-5.0), septicemia (HR=3.1; 95% CI 2.6-3.6),
pyelonephritis (HR=2.5; 95% CI 2.1-3.2), cellulitis
(HR=1.9; 95% CI 1.5-2.3), endocarditis (HR=2.2; 95% CI
1.2-3.9) and meningitis (HR=3.1; 95% CI 1.5-6.5) (Table
2). Our findings that MGUS patients are at a 2-fold
increased risk of a broad range of bacterial infections agree
with the results of the prior smaller study from Denmark,
9
and they support the hypothesis that MGUS is associated
with an underlying immunodeficiency. It is clear that the
major immunological defect in MM and Waldenström
macroglobulinemia (WM) patients is in the humoral sys￾tem, with a diminished production of polyclonal
immunoglobulins which leads to a defective antibody
response.
1,14,15 In MGUS, prior studies report that
hypogammaglobulinemia is present in 25-28% of the
cases.
9,16 Interestingly, in contrast to MM and WM, in the
MGUS study from Denmark, presence of hypogamma￾globulinemia was not associated with an increased risk of
bacteremia.
9 A limitation of our study was the lack of
quantitative data regarding immunoglobulins in the large
majority of the MGUS patients.
6
Regarding individual viral infections, compared to con￾trols, MGUS patients had a 2.7-fold (95% CI 2.1-3.6) and
2.7-fold (95% CI 2.2-3.3) increased risk of developing viral
infections at five and ten years, respectively. At 10-year
follow up, MGUS patients had an increased risk of
influenza (HR=2.7; 95% CI 1.9-3.9) and herpes zoster
(HR=2.8; 95% CI 2.0-3.9; Table 2). To our knowledge, this
is the first large population-based study that shows that

MGUS patients have an increased risk of viral infections.
Interestingly, this risk is similar to that we observed for
bacterial infections. MM and WM patients have an
increased risk of viral infections. However, this is mainly
related to the therapy given, e.g. herpes zoster infections
in patients treated with bortezomib.
17 In a case series,
MGUS was associated with an increased frequency of
Epstein-Barr infections.
18 In the study from the Mayo clin￾ic, no increase in several viral infections (chronic hepatitis,
cytomegalovirus infection, Epstein-Barr infection, hepati￾tis C, human immunodeficiency virus) was found among
patients with MGUS.
8
We found that the risk of infections was similar for the
different MGUS isotypes (IgG, IgA and IgM; Table 3) and
in an analysis stratified by M-protein concentration, the
risk of infection was similar among MGUS cases with an
M-protein of 1.0 g/dL and over, and less than 1.0 g/dL,
respectively (Table 3). MGUS patients with M-protein
concentrations over 2.5 g/dL at diagnosis had higher
(P<0.005) risks of infections compared to those with con￾centrations less than 0.5 g/dL. However, compared to con￾trols, the risk of infections was still significantly increased
among MGUS patients with concentrations less than 0.5
g/dL. The underlying mechanisms for these findings are
not clear, but it is known that higher M-proteins are asso￾ciated with hypogammaglobulinemia.
When we assessed the risk of developing MM (n=187),
WM or related malignancies (n=20) among MGUS
patients with (vs. without) an infectious event, we found
no statistical difference (HR=0.72; 95% CI 0.40-1.30). In a
sensitivity analysis, we also excluded MGUS patients who
developed myeloma and the risk estimates were similar
(data not shown). Prior studies have found a history of infec￾tious disease to increase the risk of developing MGUS and
MM suggesting that infections may trigger MGUS or MM
in susceptible patients.
19,20 Furthermore, low levels of poly￾clonal immunoglobulins in MGUS patients have been
found to be a risk factor for progression to MM or a relat￾ed lymphoproliferative malignancy.
21 Taken together, the
predisposing role of infections in MGUS and MM remains
for the most part unclear.
Lastly, when we stratified risk of infections by three cal￾endar time periods of MGUS diagnosis or selection
(<1987, 1988-1996, and >1997 ), MGUS patients had
somewhat different, but consistently increased risk of
infections for all calendar periods with HR=2.8 (95% CI
2.1-3.6, HR=1.9 (95% CI 1.7-2.3), and 2.1 (95% CI 1.9-2.4)
for before 1987, 1988-1996, and after 1997, respectively (P
heterogeneity <0.001).
Our study has several strengths, including its large sam￾ple size and the high-quality population-based data from
Sweden, including a population that had access to stan￾dardized medical care during the entire study period. As
reported previously,
22 the MGUS patients in our study
were diagnosed at hematology/oncology outpatient units
using standard criteria at the time of diagnosis. In accor￾dance with clinical practice in Sweden, most MGUS
patients typically underwent a bone marrow examination
as part of the clinical workup. In a recent validation study,
we have reported that ascertainment and diagnostic accu￾racy for lymphoproliferative disorders is very high (>90-
95%) in Sweden.
23 Limitations are the lack of information
on detailed clinical data including bone marrow examina￾tion and underlying diseases, and thus the observed excess
risks among MGUS patients may partly reflect various
underlying medical illnesses that led to the medical work￾up and the detection of the M-protein. To lessen the
impact of this problem, we excluded MGUS patients with

a diagnosis of a lymphoproliferative malignancy and infec￾tions diagnosed within six months following MGUS diag￾nosis from our analyses.
24 Since our controls were popula￾tion-based and not screened for M-protein, one has to be
cautious and consider possible bias. For example, given
the fact that MGUS patients are followed clinically, it may
have contributed to the reporting of more infections (i.e.
surveillance bias). One future strategy to assess the poten￾tial influence of detection and surveillance bias may be the
launching of a large record-linkage study based on a
screened MGUS population. Although the risk deter￾mined in a screened MGUS population is likely to be more
conservative and would also reflect the biological under￾pinning involved in infectious complications following
MGUS, this study is based on the general clinical setting.
Another limitation is that some of the controls are expect￾ed to have undiagnosed MGUS. Furthermore, there is also
the potential for inaccuracy and the lack of independent
validation of infectious diagnosis obtained from the cen￾tralized Patient Registry as the infections may not be
microbiologically verified. However, this problem should
affect MGUS cases and matched controls equally and thus
any bias should be towards a null association.
In summary, we found MGUS patients from a clinic￾based cohort to have a significantly increased risk of several
types of both bacterial and viral infections. High M-protein
concentration at diagnosis was associated with the highest
risks of infections. However, the occurrence of infection
was not associated with MM or lymphoproliferative dis￾ease progression. Our study provides novel insights into the
underlying mechanisms behind infections in patients with
plasma cell dyscrasias, and may have clinical implications
for treatment strategies, prophylactic measures and vacci￾nations, as well as surveillance of MGUS patients.
