Choice of direct acting antiviral (DAA) therapy for Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) in the
United Kingdom and similar settings usually requires knowledge of the genotype and, in
some cases, antiviral resistance (AVR) profile of the infecting virus. To determine these,
most laboratories currently use Sanger technology, but next-generation sequencing
(NGS) offers potential advantages in throughput and accuracy. However, NGS poses
unique technical challenges, which require idiosyncratic development and technical
validation approaches. This applies particularly to virology, where sequence diversity
is high and the amount of starting genetic material is low, making it difficult to distinguish
real data from artifacts. We describe the development and technical validation of a
sequence capture-based HCV whole genome sequencing (WGS) assay to determine
viral genotype and AVR profile. We use clinical samples of known subtypes and viral
loads, and simulated FASTQ datasets to validate the analytical performances of both
the wet laboratory and bioinformatic pipeline procedures. We show high concordance
of the WGS assay compared to current “gold standard” Sanger assays. Specificity
was 92.3 and 96.1% for AVR and genotyping, respectively. Discordances were due to
the inability of Sanger assays to assign the correct subtype or accurately call mixed
drug-resistant variants. We show high repeatability and reproducibility with >99.8%
sequence similarity between sequence runs as well as high precision for variant
frequency detection at >98.8% in the 95th percentile. Post-sequencing bioinformatics
quality control workflows allow the accurate distinction between mixed infections,
cross-contaminants and recombinant viruses at a threshold of >5% for the minority
population. The sequence capture-based HCV WGS assay is more accurate than legacy

pathway of England’s National Health Service HCV treatment programs, representing
the first validated HCV WGS pipeline in clinical service. The data generated will
additionally provide granular national-level genomic information for public health policy
making and support the WHO HCV elimination strategy.

INTRODUCTION
Nucleic acid sequencing assays have been used for direct patient
care in clinical virology for decades, for example, to inform
management of antiretroviral therapy in HIV-infected patients
(Hanna and D’aquila, 2001; Haubrich and Demeter, 2001).
Conventionally, this involves targeted amplification of specific
viral genes followed by sequencing using Sanger or recently,
next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies. However, this
approach has limitations when used for highly diverse viruses
such as hepatitis C virus (HCV), including the challenge of
developing pan-genotypic target specific amplification assays.
Thus, most available in-house and commercial assays are
genotype-specific and do not cover all known and unclassified
subtypes or recombinant virus strains (Rodriguez et al., 2018,
2019). For antiviral resistance (AVR), the assays require prior
knowledge of the subtype of infecting virus and, as antiviral
drugs target several viral gene products, multiple assays must be
performed, resulting in a stepwise process that is laborious and
not amenable to high throughput.
Recently, we showed that genotype-agnostic HCV whole
genome sequencing (WGS) assays using sequence capture target
enrichment provide genotype and AVR information in a single
test and are amenable to high throughput (Thomson et al.,
2016). Genetically, HCV is highly variable and, based upon
nucleotide sequence, is divided into eight genotypes (1–8) which
in turn are further subdivided into >90 subtypes (designated
by letters of the alphabet e.g., 1a for genotype 1 subtype a)
(Smith et al., 2014, 2019; Borgia et al., 2018). HCV strains
belonging to different genotypes differ at 30–35% of nucleotide
sites whereas strains that belong to the same subtype differ at
<15% of nucleotide sites. The target enrichment probe baits used
for the sequence capture assay are ∼120-bp long and can tolerate
up to 20% mismatch in target sequence allowing intra-subtype,
and in conserved regions, inter-genotype coverage; therefore, a
small number of pooled probe baits can be used to cover the
high diversity observed in HCV and detect unclassified subtypes
(Bonsall et al., 2015).
Clinically, it is well established that there are genotype￾or subtype-specific differences in response to treatment and
knowledge of the genetic composition of a patient’s HCV strain
is consequently of key importance for selecting the optimal
treatment regimen (European Association for the Study of the
Liver, 2018). Historically, HCV drug therapy was limited to
pegylated interferon-α and ribavirin, which were more effective
against genotypes 2 and 3 than other genotypes, required
a prolonged course sometimes exceeding a year, and were
associated with considerable toxicity. Furthermore, outcomes
were often poor, due to a sustained virological response (SVR) of
less than 50% in genotype 1-infected patients (Manns et al., 2001).
New direct acting antivirals (DAA) directly inhibit the function
of viral NS5a, polymerase (NS5b) or protease (NS3) and have
minimal side effects, shortened duration of therapy of weeks, and
yield SVR rates of >95% (Kohli et al., 2014). Notwithstanding
the high efficacy of DAA, many do not have a pan-genotypic
action and have mainly been evaluated against the common
subtypes prevalent in the Western world, these being 1a, 1b, and
3a. Furthermore, the current NHS England HCV treatment rate
card is predominantly genotype- and disease stage-specific, and
therefore HCV genotyping is a prerequisite for optimal regimen
determination (Hawkes, 2019).
The determination of HCV genotype has mostly been
performed using line probe-based assays, real-time PCR assays,
or partial genome sequencing of 50UTR, core and/or NS5b
domains. The third approach has been shown to be more
accurate, but occasionally misassigns the subtype, and cannot
identify recombinants unless several targets are used (Weck,
2005; Cai et al., 2013). These approaches are also unable to
identify mixed infections. Additionally, drug resistance testing
is recommended for the detection of key polymorphisms in
genotype 1a viruses that have a strong effect upon response to the
NS5a inhibitor elbasvir at baseline (Bradshaw et al., 2019). AVR
testing is frequently requested by clinicians to guide retreatment
strategy following treatment failure (Panel, 2018; Bradshaw et al.,
2019). Thus, the determination of genotype and/or AVR at
patient entry into care has clear and direct benefits. It enables
early selection of the most appropriate regimen with concomitant
reduction in the cost of treatment by avoiding the use of inferior
or more expensive options, or retreatment. Furthermore, WGS
provides refined genotyping data compared to current partial
genome sequencing and can detect where a patient is infected
with multiple strains or with a recombinant strain, data that are
not generated by current techniques.
There are unique quality assurance challenges posed by
viral NGS assays that often go unheeded and a paucity of
standardized technical validation protocols essential to fulfill
laboratory accreditation and regulatory requirements prior to
implementation in the clinical pathway. Here, we perform the
technical validation of a sequence capture HCV WGS assay
implemented for direct patient care in the United Kingdom.
We establish the quality metrics for consistent generation
of robust HCV sequence data as well as determine the
analytical performance of the assay. We also establish quality
control procedures for detection and distinction between

cross-contaminants, mixed infections and recombinant viruses
which are significant quality assurance challenges faced by
viral NGS assays.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Samples and Controls
Plasma samples submitted to Public Health England (PHE) for
HCV genotypic and/or drug resistance analysis were selected
for technical validation of the HCV Sequence Capture assay
described in this study. Samples comprising a variety of
genotypes and subtypes circulating in the United Kingdom and
worldwide, and a range of viral loads were included in the
validation of the assay.
Each MiSeq run was loaded with uniquely indexed, pooled
libraries constructed from 72 samples: 62 clinical samples, two
positive controls (PC), four negative human plasma (NHP,
provided by NHS Blood and Transplant) controls, and four
“no template controls” (NTC) of molecular grade water, were
extracted. Both sets of negative controls were expected to be
negative by HCV qPCR. The NHP controls were expected to have
a total library mass yield similar to other clinical samples included
in the experiment. In contrast, the total mass of the NTC libraries
was expected to be no larger than background measurements.
To monitor cross-contamination within or between
experiments, the positions of the control samples was shifted
between consecutive batches of 72 libraries, and two independent
sets of indexes were used in alternate runs.
Library Preparation
For each sample, 350 µl of plasma was extracted using automated
NucliSens easyMAG (BioMérieux) kits and eluted into a volume
of 25 µl elution buffer. The entire volume of each nucleic
acid extract was subjected to DNAse digestion with 0.25 U of
TURBO DNAse (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in 30 µl reactions
incubated for 30 min at 37◦C. Digestion products were cleaned
up using 2× AMPure XP Beads (Beckman Coulter) following
the manufacturer’s instructions, with a final elution volume of
10 µl nuclease-free water. The 10 µl volume of DNAse-digested
RNA extracts were used to generate DNA libraries with the
KAPA RNA HyperPrep Kit (Roche). The manufacturer’s protocol
recommends a minimum RNA input of 1 ng. As our inputs were
substantially lower, we made several modifications to the protocol
(Supplementary Table S1). For indexing, HT Dual Index Duplex
Adapters (Integrated DNA Technologies) were used.
QC Metrics for Library Prep and Target
Enrichment
To establish the quality control (QC) metrics for the consistent
generation of HCV-enriched DNA libraries, we quantify the
relative amount of HCV fragments in the RNA extracts and
their relative DNA libraries by HCV-specific qPCR assay using
the QuantiTect Virus kit (Qiagen) and the KAPA Probe Fast
Universal kit (Sigma Aldrich), respectively. Both qPCR assays
were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions
using previously described primers and probes targeting HCV
(Davalieva et al., 2014). Total mass of the libraries was determined
using Quant-it dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Invitrogen), following the
manufacturer’s specification.
Sequence Capture
Each HCV target enrichment experiment carried out during
the technical validation was performed using batches of 72
DNA libraries (which included two positive controls, four NHP
controls, and four nuclease-free water controls). Considering
the range of relative abundances of viral inserts in each
individual DNA library determined by HCV-specific qPCR,
each batch of DNA libraries were split into two groups:
Low HCV cycle threshold (Ct) and High HCV Ct. The
definition of “low” and “high” Ct was assessed individually
per experiment. Depending on the range of Ct values of
all libraries included in the experiment, a Ct value which
allows the samples to be divided into two pools with: (i) a
similar number of samples in each one; and (ii) the sample
library with lowest Ct is 6 to 10 Ct cycles different from
the library with higher Ct in the Low Ct pool and 10–20
in the High Ct Pool. DNA libraries assigned to each group
were pooled by mass as determined in section QC metrics for
library prep and target enrichment, adding the same number
of nanograms of each DNA library to the pool. A total of
500 ng of each pool were used to perform the subsequent capture
of HCV fragments.
The pooled DNA libraries were hybridized and captured
using 120-nt HCV-specific biotinylated oligonucleotide probes
targeted against genotypes 1–6 (Integrated DNA Technologies)
and NimbleGen SeqCap target enrichment reagents (Roche)
following manufacturer’s specifications, but instead of Multiplex
Hybridization Enhancing Oligo Pool, using xGen Blocking
Oligos (Integrated DNA technologies) (Bonsall et al., 2015).
To each pooled DNA library, we added 6 pmol HCV-specific
probes to the hybridization reaction, then incubated them in
a thermocycler at 47◦C (with the lid heated to 57◦C) for
24 h. Following hybridization, the HCV DNA libraries bound
to the biotinylated probes were partitioned using magnetic
streptavidin-coated beads and the “low” and “high” Ct pools
were subjected to a further 12 or 16 cycles of PCR amplification,
respectively. The concentrations of both amplified pools (ng/µl)
were determined as described above, and the two pools were
themselves pooled, adding the same relative quantity of HCV￾specific library per pool.
Next Generation Sequencing
Prior to sequencing, the final pool was quantified using
the KAPA SYBR FAST Universal qPCR Kit for Illumina
libraries (KAPA Biosystems) on a 7500 Real-Time PCR
System (Applied Biosystems), and analyzed for fragment size
distribution using the High Sensitivity DNA Kit (Agilent) on
a 2100 Bioanalyzer Instrument, both following manufacturers’
specifications. Sequencing was performed on an Illumina MiSeq
instrument using the MiSeq Reagent Kit V2 (300 cycles)
(Illumina), with the following minor modifications to the
manufacturer’s guidelines. The final pool was diluted to 2 nM

and denatured with 0.2 N sodium hydroxide for 2 min rather
than five, incubated for 4 min at 95◦C, and diluted in kit reagent
HT1 to produce 1 ml of a 20 pM solution. These were further
diluted to make 700 µl of a 9 pM solution, of which 10% was
substituted with 12.5 pM PhiX sequencing control V3 (Illumina).
A volume of 600 µl of this final solution was loaded onto the
MiSeq cartridge.
Amplicon-Based Sanger Sequencing
Viral RNA was extracted from 200 uL of plasma using QIAamp
UltraSens Virus Kit (QIAGEN) and eluted in a final volume
of 60 µL. A subtype-specific PCR assay was used to amplify
sequences in NS5A gene (positions 6095 to 7833) from subtype
1a samples. Briefly, cDNA was generated using 5 µL of viral
RNA extract and SuperScript II One-Step RT-PCR System with
Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen) followed by nested
PCR using Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen). Sanger
sequencing used the dideoxy ABI sequencing systems in both
directions using overlapping internal primers. Primers used for
RT-PCR, nested PCR and sequencing, and cycling conditions are
indicated in Supplementary Table S2. A previously described
pan-genotypic PCR assay was used to amplify a fragment
of the NS5B gene from samples of different genotypes and
subtypes (Mellor et al., 1995). Sequences were analyzed using
Sequencher software (Gene Codes) and aligned using subtype￾specific consensus sequences.
Sequences obtained from each method were compared
with those derived from NGS methods (global consensus),
and the numbers of nucleotide and amino acid sequence
differences were recorded.
Bioinformatic Pipeline
De-multiplexed, adapter-stripped, paired end FASTQs
were subjected to human read removal by
competitive mapping with SMALT (downloaded from
www.sanger.ac.uk/science/tools/smalt-0) against an index
compiled from a combined FASTA set containing both the
hg38 human genome reference and an HCV reference genome
set comprising 164 subtype-annotated HCV whole genome
sequences obtained from the Los Alamos sequence database
(Kuiken et al., 2005). Reads mapping to the human reference at
either end were discarded and surviving paired-end reads were
reconstituted using samtools v1.8 (Li et al., 2009) and mapped
to the HCV reference genome set, with the frequencies of hits to
each subtype recorded using “Splitpops” tool.1
FASTQs were subjected to de novo assembly using VICUNA
v1.3 (Yang et al., 2012). In cases where a complete genome
was not assembled directly, LASTZ v1.02 (Harris, 2007) used
the subgenomic contigs to select the best-matching reference
from the HCV reference set, and attempted to iteratively close
gaps between contigs with BWA MEM (Li, 2013). The final
BAM file was processed using an in-house C++ program
(QuasiBAM) (Penedos et al., 2015) to derive a consensus
sequence, and a tabular file recording nucleotide frequency,
depth and quality metrics for each nucleotide position in the
1https://github.com/camilla-ip/AnalysisTools
mapping process. Positions with mixtures greater than 15%
were coded as IUPAC ambiguities and those with depths of
coverage below 30 were considered to be unreliable and thus
coded as Ns. Regions containing Ns were not used in downstream
analyses. Output data was then submitted to Geno2pheno[hcv]
(Kalaghatgi et al., 2016) genotypic interpretation systems for
assignment of genotype and interpretation of resistance.
Generating Synthetic Quasispecies and
FASTQ Datasets
An in-house script was used to generate synthetic quasispecies,
expanding upon the approach described by Pandit and De
Boer (2014). These were used to validate components of the
bioinformatic pipeline. In brief, for a given HCV subtype, a multi￾sequence alignment (MSA) of whole genome sequences was
obtained from the Los Alamos HCV Sequence Database (Kuiken
et al., 2005). Shannon entropy scores of the base frequency
distributions for each column of the alignment were calculated
to make a “weighted sites array.” Selection of genome loci to be
mutated was by random sampling of this array, thus sites shown
to be variable (albeit at the population level) were more frequently
chosen than conserved regions. Furthermore, mutations at a
locus were enacted by randomly selecting a sequence from MSA
and substituting its base identity for the original, thus reinforcing
conserved/variable regions. Indel variations were mutated en bloc
rather than single sites.
A random sequence was selected from the MSA and by
sampling the weighted sites array a number of times equal
to 5% of the genome length and mutating these positions,
a “parent” node sequence was generated. Child nodes were
generated recursively, with the parental genome mutating
between generations. The number of children per node was
sampled from a normal distribution whose mean decreased as
a function of distance from the parent node, thus limiting the
number of generations and hence the size of the quasispecies.
The output of this process is a hierarchical tree representing
the relationships between each of the genome nodes, together
with an MSA of all the constituent genomes. The median
number of sequences per synthetic quasispecies was 1,579
(IQR 1,089-2,418).
To obtain quasispecies with specified characteristics, MSAs
were further modified, either by introducing RAS into a
selected percentage of lineage(s) (either linked or unlinked), by
recombining two quasispecies at a specified breakpoint, and/or
by randomly mixing quasispecies members at defined ratios to
simulate dual infections.
Synthetic FASTQ datasets were prepared from synthetic
quasispecies FASTA files using the open-source software tool
ART (Huang et al., 2012). Mean and standard deviation insert
size were specified from empirical data sets, and FASTA sampling
parameters were set to maximize homogeneous representation of
each input sequence. In-house scripts were used to mix synthetic
FASTQ sets with FASTQ sets obtained from NHP libraries
prepared as described above. To conceal their provenance, all
reads in the combined datasets were shuffled and renamed
prior to analysis.

RESULTS
Establishment of Library Prep QC
Metrics
DNA library preps made from RNA extracts of clinical samples
from HCV-infected individuals with HCV Ct value <23
reproducibly resulted in more than 10% of total reads mapping
to HCV with a genome coverage >90% at a read depth >30 after
enrichment with HCV-specific probe baits. The median of the
differential in HCV Ct values between the DNA library prep and
respective RNA extract was 9.96 cycles [9.0–10.78; IQR].
Sensitivity
We determined the limit of detection for AVR analysis in
NS3, NS5a, or NS5b genes and for genotyping using clinical
samples containing HCV of different subtypes and viral loads.
AVR data was generated in >90% and >50% of the samples
at a viral load of ≥5.6 and ≥4.5 log10 IU/mL, respectively
(Figure 1A). The limit of detection was lower for genotyping at
≥4.8 and ≥4.3 log10 IU/mL for >90 and >50% of the samples,
respectively (Figure 1B).
Accuracy
We determined the accuracy of the WGS assay by assessing the
degree of agreement between the consensus sequences generated
by the assay and the “gold standard” amplicon-based Sanger
assay. This showed that the positive percent agreement (PPA) was
99.5% [99.3–99.6] at the nucleotide level and 99.7% [99.5–99.9]
at the amino acid level for the NS5a region used for resistance￾associated substitutions (RAS) testing in 17 subtype 1a samples
(Figure 2A). Similarly, the PPA was 99.7% [99.5–99.8] at the
nucleotide level and 99.7% [99.3–99.9] at the amino acid level in
the NS5b region used for genotyping in 14 samples of varying
subtypes (Figure 2A). The discordances were all due to mixed
base sites where one method identified only one of two bases in
a mixture. The exceptions were one instance where two of three
bases were identified and one instance of complete discordance.
In total, mixed bases were called at 216 of 10,863 positions (2.0%)
and 39 of 4,606 positions (0.8%) in NS5a and NS5b, respectively.

FIGURE 2 | Determination of the accuracy of the HCV WGS assay. (A) Accuracy was assessed by determining the degree of agreement between the consensus
FASTA sequences generated by the assay at a variant frequency threshold of 15% compared with the consensus FASTA sequence generated by the “gold
standard” amplicon-based Sanger assay in NS5a and NS5b genes at nucleotide and amino acid level. (B) Determination of the variant frequency at discordant
positions as determined by the WGS assay where the variant was called by either WGS or Sanger assay.
Of these, 157 (72.7%) in NS5a and 26 (66.7%) in NS5b were
called by both methods. Of the total 72 mixed bases only called
by one method, 39 were called by Sanger (54.2%) compared to
33 (45.8%) by WGS. The median frequency of variants called
by WGS but not Sanger was 19.8% [17–28.4] and 32.5% [16.5–
46.9] compared to 8.8% [2.5–13] and 9.1% [0–13.5] for variants
called by Sanger but not WGS in NS5a and NS5b, respectively
(Figure 2B and Supplementary Table S3). Most of the discordant
mixtures (65/72; 90.3%) involved transition mutations (C↔T
or G↔A). The nucleotide discordances resulted in 8 of 3,195
(0.25%) and 4 of 1,417 (0.28%) amino acid discordances in NS5a
and NS5b, respectively.
Inclusivity and Specificity
We investigated the ability of the assay to specifically detect
genetic variations associated with AVR and the ability to
distinguish the subtype of infecting virus. We used samples with
known resistance markers and subtype that had been determined
using the current “gold standard” Sanger-based sequencing, real￾time PCR or probe-based assays. The genotyping sample panel
consisted of 120 specimens, the majority (72.5%; n = 87) were
of the most common subtypes in the United Kingdom, i.e., 1a,
1b, or 3a (Table 1). The remainder consisted of different “rare”
subtypes (24.2%; n = 29) or samples where the subtype could not
be determined by current methods (3.3%; n = 4). Overall, 116
of 120 samples, 96.7% [91.7–99.1], generated the same inferred
genotype/subtype as the current methods. For the most common
subtypes, the PPA between WGS and current methods was 98.9%
[93.8–100]. In three of the four discordant results the “gold
standard” methods assigned the wrong subtype whereas WGS
identified the samples as being novel or unclassified subtypes
(Table 2 and Supplementary Figure S1). In the remaining
discordant sample the “gold standard” method was unable to
assign a subtype whereas WGS did. In addition, there were
three samples where the “gold standard” methods identified the
correct genotype but were unable to assign a subtype and WGS

sequencing. WGS could detect 24 of the 26 RAS, yielding a
PPA of 92.3% [74.9–99.1]. The first RAS detected by Sanger
sequencing but not WGS was a mixture Y93CY in NS5a (Table 2).
Analysis of variant frequency from the WGS data showed that
the Y93C variant was present but at a frequency of 6%, below the
15% variant frequency threshold set for WGS assay. The second
discordant RAS was at position 28 in the NS5a gene of another
sample where Sanger sequencing detected a mixture of A and V
whereas WGS only identified V.
Precision and Linearity
To assess the degree to which repeated sequencing of a specimen
gave the same result, we performed intra-run and inter-run
repeatability testing. For intra-run repeatability, for each sample
three replicates of a DNA library were target-enriched separately
and sequenced in the same MiSeq run. Inter-run repeatability
was assayed firstly, by sequencing the same target-enriched DNA
library prep in separate MiSeq runs and secondly, by generating
replicate DNA libraries of the same specimen from different RNA
extracts on different days (reproducibility). There was a strong
positive correlation between median read depth of the replicates
for both repeatability (R
2 = 0.99) and reproducibility (R
2 = 0.76)
experiments (data not shown).
The mean genetic similarities for the intra- and inter-run
repeatability experiments was >99.9% and exhibited very low
measures of uncertainty with mean Shannon entropy <0.00017
(Table 3). Discordances were observed at ≤4 sites and were due
to sites where a mixture was detected in one run with only one of
the mixed bases present in the replicate or vice versa. The genetic
similarities for the reproducibility experiments were again very
high at >99.6%. However, the number of discordant sites was
slightly higher ranging from 0 to 63 sites, as was the measure of
uncertainty with mean Shannon entropy of 0.00178 (Table 3).
Next, we determined the consistency of detecting variant
frequencies in repeatability and reproducibility experiments.
The proportion of positions at which the difference in
observed variant frequency of the sequence replicates at
all nucleotides in the coding region of the HCV genome
was <1% ranged from 88.8 to 97.09% for reproducibility
and inter-run repeatability experiments, respectively. The
proportion of positions approached 100% when the difference
in variant frequency was <5%, ranging from 98.86 to 100%
for reproducibility and inter-run repeatability experiments,
respectively (Table 3). Regions with large differences in variant
frequencies between replicates were distributed throughout the
whole genome but were mostly associated with regions of
high diversity or homopolymers, such as the E1/E2 region
(Supplementary Figure S2).
We further assessed the linearity of the assay by determining
the effect of sampling bias on variant frequency detection.
Variant frequencies were analyzed across the whole genome
and specifically at drug resistance positions in serially diluted
clinical samples of a variety of subtypes. Five three-fold dilutions
were generated for four samples of subtype 1a, 2b, 3a, and
4a. As expected, overall genome coverage was 85–100% for the
neat and first three dilution series but subsequently decreased
across the dilution series (Supplementary Figure S3). We
observed that the proportion of nucleotide positions discordant
with the corresponding neat sample increased across the
dilution series (Figure 3). In contrast, the proportion of amino
acid discordances initially increased but eventually decreased
(Figure 3). When analysis was limited to the 39 resistance￾associated positions in NS3, NS5A, and NS5B, only a single
discordance was observed between the dilution series and their
corresponding neat sample. Position 31 in NS5A was mixed (M
and L) in all but the final dilution of sample 2, where only M was
detected. The frequency of M at this position varied across the
dilutions from 71.6% in the neat sample, through 58.7, 61.7, and
37.6% in the first three dilutions with read depths of 493, 3885,
860, and 668, respectively. The position was not covered in the
fourth dilution, and was present at 100% in the final dilution, at
a depth of 2085.
To assess the contribution of the bioinformatics pipeline to
the variability in variant frequency calling, we used simulated
FASTQ datasets generated from synthetic HCV quasispecies
with different RAS introduced at predetermined but varying
frequencies ranging from 1 to 100%. We then analyzed all
the positions where the RAS variant was present at <100%
(n = 94) and compared the bioinformatics pipeline outputs to
the expected results (Figure 4). This showed variation in variant
frequency calling of up to 8.6% above or below the expected value
resulting in two missed calls of mutations present at a frequency
greater than 15%. Both were of NS5a RAS in the same subtype 3a
quasispecies: A30K at 15.2% was reported at 12.9%, and Y93H at
16.6% was reported at 12.5%.
Post-sequencing Quality Control Checks
One of the biggest quality assurance challenges of WGS is cross￾contamination that can occur during the laboratory processing
of the samples, a phenomenon identified as a major issue
during the assay development phase (Thomson et al., 2016).
We used simulated FASTQ datasets generated from synthetic

HCV quasispecies and sequencing outputs from NHP libraries
mentioned above to determine the ability of the bioinformatics
pipeline to detect and distinguish between cross-contaminants,
mixed infections and recombinant viruses because no “gold
standard” reference standards currently exist.
Analysis of each synthetic subtype quasispecies datasets by
the Splitpops software of the bioinformatics pipeline yielded the
correct identification of a primary majority subtype population.
However, the pipeline also reported a secondary minority
population at <5% belonging to a different subtype but
same genotype as the majority population e.g., a 1c minority
population reported for a quasispecies simulated from a 1a
population (Supplementary Table S4A).
For mixed infection datasets, the ratios and subtypes of the
constituent populations were correctly estimated by the Splitpops
software down to approximately the 20:1 ratio, thus representing
a secondary population at ≥5% (Supplementary Table S4B).
Analysis of the recombinant virus datasets also resulted in
detection of the different subtypes constituting the recombinant
virus if the secondary subtype of the recombinant strain was
present at ≥9.6%; however, the Splitpops software was less
accurate at determining the exact ratios of constituent subtypes
making up the recombinant virus (Supplementary Table S4B).
When the synthetic datasets were mixed with background reads
containing human pegivirus, a virus distantly related to HCV
and associated with HCV infections (Bonsall et al., 2016; Wang
et al., 2018; Sridhar et al., 2019), Splitpops could identify the
primary infection in single infections and both subtypes in mixed
infections (Supplementary Table S4C). However, the percentage
of mapped reads belonging to HCV was always significantly
lower than expected (<82%); however, this was relative to the
percentage of background reads added and did not affect the
expected ratio of subtypes in the mixed infections.
Thus, we set a Splitpops threshold of >5% for the secondary
population and/or <85% for the primary population to flag
the presence of mixed infection, recombinant virus, unclassified
subtypes or cross-contamination in clinical samples. This
finding triggers the performance of additional bioinformatics
analyses to rule out cross-contamination and confirm any
finding of mixed infection or recombinant virus. This involved:
(i) phylogenetic reconstruction from individual HCV gene
regions of all sequences in the MiSeq run and previous five runs;
(ii) genome assembly from reads of the separate populations to
determine if full-length genomes are present; and (iii) similarity
plot analysis of the consensus whole genomes to determine
possible recombination break points or unclassified subtypes.

with samples that have a secondary population at >5% and/or

For mixed infection, two sequences were assembled from
sample 49-S64 (subtypes 2b and 1a) that were independently
located on the NS5b phylogenetic tree (Figure 5C) and were
not closely related to other sequences in the same or the five
previous runs. Further bioinformatic analysis showed a uniform
distribution of subtypes 2b and 1a across the whole genome
at proportions equivalent to those determined by Splitpops
(Figure 5D). This confirmed the sample as a mixed infection.
Lastly, with regards recombinant virus only one whole genome
sequence was assembled from sample 10-S43. Phylogenetic
analyses showed that the sequence clustered with subtype 2k
sequences in the core gene (Figure 6A) and other 50

DISCUSSION
We performed the technical validation of a genotype-agnostic
HCV WGS assay for the simultaneous detection of genotype and
AVR in the clinical pathway. An assessment of the analytical
performance characteristics of the assay showed comparable
and often superior results compared to current “gold standard”
assays. One exception was sensitivity, defined as the lowest
concentration of HCV in a clinical sample that generated
reportable sequence data in the clinically relevant regions.
This was determined to be approximately 4.3 log10 IU/mL
for genotyping and 4.5 log10 IU/mL for AVR for the HCV
WGS assay. As expected, this is higher than that of PCR￾based sequencing assays which can generate positive results on
samples with viral loads of 3.0 log10 IU/mL or less because they
employ gene-specific primers and significantly more cycles of
amplification. However, 4.3 and 4.5 log10 IU/mL are considerably
below the viral load of most blood samples from treatment-naïve
HCV-infected patients we routinely process which is usually over
tens of thousands IU/mL.
On the other hand, the WGS assay showed high specificity
and achieved a PPA of >99.6% at nucleotide level and ≥99.9%
at the amino acid level in the NS5a and NS5b genes of different
genotypes and subtypes compared to the current “gold standard”
Sanger sequencing assay. The few observed discordances were
due to mixed base positions where only one base of the mixture
was detected in one of the assays but with no specific trend.
A minority of the nucleotide discordances resulted in amino
acid changes (12/66, 18.2%), suggesting that they often occur
at synonymous sites where underlying quasispecies variation
is present and thus may be a result of stochastic sampling
rather than assay polymerase errors. This was further confirmed
by repeatability and reproducibility experiments where more
variation in variant frequency calls was observed for the latter
with the few differences again located at mixed base positions.
On average, 2 and 23 discordances were observed over the
whole genome for repeatability and reproducibility experiments,
respectively. However, the variant frequency differences between
duplicates were still very small, at ∼2% compared to ∼1% at the
95th percentile for reproducibility and repeatability experiments,
respectively, with the large differences in variant frequencies
mostly associated with regions of intrinsic high genetic diversity.
These data were further supported by high similarities in
sequence data generated by both experiments which was >99.6%.
However, precision experiments on variant frequency detection
using serial dilutions suggest sampling bias does significantly
affect the efficiency of detection of minor variants and could thus
be highly variable at low viral load.
Most importantly, the PPA for assignment of virus subtype
was 98.9% for the most common circulating subtypes in the
United Kingdom (subtypes 1a, 1b, and 3a) and 96.7% overall
compared to the current “gold standard” genotyping assays.
Discordances were either due to the WGS assay being able
to assign a subtype where the current genotyping couldn’t or
where current genotyping methods assigned wrong subtypes to
novel unclassified subtypes. In addition, the WGS assay identified

novel subtypes where the current assays could only assign
genotype. Thus, WGS is more accurate at assigning the subtype of
infecting virus compared to the current “gold standard” methods.
Similarly, the WGS assay had a PPA of 92.6% for detection of
AVR markers compared to Sanger sequencing assays. This was
assessed over 26 markers in NS3, NS5a or NS5b of subtype 1a
viruses. The two discordant results were due to the presence of
mixtures. In the first discordant sample, the Y93CY mixture in
NS5a gene was detected by the Sanger assay, which uses a variant
frequency threshold of 20%. However, the WGS assay detected
the Y93C variant at 6%, which is below the 15% variant threshold
used by the WGS assay and is recommended for interpretation
of NGS data (Zeuzem et al., 2017; European Association for
the Study of the Liver, 2018; Panel, 2018; Bradshaw et al.,
2019). We surmise that the Sanger assay inaccurately detected
this variant to be present at >20% as it estimates variant
frequencies from the height of chromatogram peaks whereas
the NGS method used by the WGS assay is based on clonal
sequencing and quantifies variant frequencies from individual
reads which is more accurate. A study comparing the accuracy
of Sanger sequencing at 20% variant frequency threshold to NGS
at 20% and 15% variant frequency thresholds showed a high
level of agreement at 99.6% [96.1–100%; range] and 99.4% [88.5–
100%; range], respectively (Parkin et al., 2020). For the second
discordant sample, the WGS assay detected the mixture M28MV
in the NS5a gene whereas the Sanger assay detected the mixture
M28AV. The M28MV mixture in WGS assay was represented
by two codons: ATG = M (21%) and GTG = V (79%). The
codon mixture in the Sanger assay was GYG giving the two
possible codons GTG = V and GCG = A. It is likely that the
G/A mixture at the first position was not detected by the Sanger
method as it is around the 20% variant frequency threshold
whereas the C/T mixture at the second position is a transition
mutation which is one of the most frequent PCR generated errors.
Sanger sequencing assays, which use gene-specific primers and
significantly more PCR cycles, are more likely to introduce errors

Manso et al. HCV WGS in Clinical Pathway
and sampling bias which may skew the exact variant frequency
in a sample. A recent study comparing sequence capture and
amplicon-based NGS methods has shown that the latter detects
more low-frequency variants than the former (Mbisa et al.,
2020). This is likely to be a result of an overcall of low￾frequency variants by amplicon-based methods rather than a
lack of sensitivity by sequence capture. However, this requires
further investigation using standard reference material with well￾characterized frequencies at mixed base positions.
Accuracy experiments provided further evidence for this
phenomenon. We observed high agreement at both nucleotide
and amino acid levels between WGS and Sanger (≥99.5%).
The discordances were mainly due to mixed bases where one
method called only one of the bases in a mixture with the
Sanger method slightly overcalling mixed bases compared to
WGS (39 vs. 33). Interestingly, the median variant frequency
at positions where mixed bases were called by WGS but not
Sanger was close to the 20% threshold of Sanger technology
(19.8 and 32.5% for NS5a and NS5b, respectively) whereas it
was significantly lower for the reverse scenario (8.8 and 9.1%
for NS5a and NS5b, respectively). This could be a result of PCR
errors and sampling bias of the Sanger method compared to the
WGS method. Most of the mixed bases involved transitions C/T
(Y) or A/G (R), the most common PCR errors most of which
did not result in amino acid changes and thus had minimal
impact on test accuracy which was >99.5%. Again, these data
show that the WGS assay is more accurate and thus superior
at detection of specific AVR markers and for determination of
consensus sequence composition compared to amplicon-based
Sanger sequencing assays.
One of the most significant quality assurance challenges
for the sequence capture HCV WGS assay, and NGS assays
in general, is cross-contamination from sequences within the
same run which can occur during sample handling or carryover
contamination as well as artifacts introduced by the Sequencer
(Nelson et al., 2014; Sehn et al., 2015; Seitz et al., 2015; Thomson
et al., 2016). On the other hand, it has been reported that
mixed infections and recombinant viruses can occur at high
frequencies depending on the characteristics of the infected
population (Mcnaughton et al., 2014, 2018; Susser et al.,
2017). Thus, in addition to implementing stringent laboratory
measures like unidirectional molecular workflows and robust
MiSeq maintenance washing and procedures, it is critical to
implement a bioinformatics solution that can accurately detect
mixed infections or recombinant viruses and distinguish these
incidences from cross-contamination (Lee et al., 2016). This is
because the former may require different therapeutic approaches
(Mcnaughton et al., 2014; Hedskog et al., 2015) whereas the
latter may result in reporting of the wrong result. To address
this quality assurance challenge, we used outputs from the
Splitpops software to determine thresholds for detection of the
different scenarios. Splitpops separates HCV reads generated
from the MiSeq run into respective HCV subtypes using a
reference sequence database according to genetic similarity. We
validated this functionality using simulated datasets of HCV
that mimicked mixed infections of different subtypes at different
frequencies and recombinant viruses with different breakpoints
observed in clinical samples. We then compared outcomes
from Splitpops to the expected results, an exercise that is not
possible using clinical samples with unknown composition.
Splitpops usually generates a secondary HCV subtype population
that constitutes <5% of total HCV reads belonging to the
same genotype as the primary population. This is due to
similarities of HCV genomes in 50
and 30 UTR regions within
genotypes and rarely across genotypes. Thus, the presence
of a secondary population within the same genotype as the
primary population present at >90% indicates a single subtype
infection. For samples where a secondary population is detected
at >5%, further bioinformatics analyses are then performed
to distinguish the origins of two or more populations. We
also show that the presence of background human pegivirus
reads can result in proportional reduction in the percentage
of total filtered reads mapping to HCV. Thus, a threshold of
<85% for the primary Splitpops population should also trigger
additional bioinformatics analysis to confirm the absence of
mixed infection or recombinant virus as the percentage of the
secondary population would be reduced. Using clinical samples,
we are able to show that this is an effective quality assurance
approach. Future quality improvements to the assay would
include: (i) the inclusion of probes targeting genotype 7 and 8
even though they are not genotypes commonly circulating in
the United Kingdom, and (ii) the use of HCV-GLUE, a recently
developed software for interpretation of genotypic resistance.
A significant advantage of HCV-GLUE is that it can process
individual reads submitted as BAM files thereby providing
accurate identification of amino acid frequencies and has a well￾curated resistance data schema. It thus represents the most
appropriate approach for interpreting viral deep sequencing
data (Singer et al., 2018, 2019). The software is also regularly
updated with emerging in vivo and in vitro evidence on HCV
drug resistance.
To summarize, we have developed an HCV WGS assay for
the simultaneous detection of genotype and AVR to be used
for direct patient care and performed the technical validation
of the assay’s analytical performance. The assay has several
advantages over current PCR-based Sanger sequencing or NGS
assays which include accurate genotyping, detection of mixed
infections, accurate detection of low frequency drug-resistance
variants, high-throughput and theoretically reduced costs. To our
knowledge, this is the first report of an end-to-end technical
validation of a viral WGS assay, and provides a benchmark for
clinical microbiology laboratories implementing viral NGS assays
as the technology gradually replaces Sanger sequencing.

Supplementary Figure S1 | Phylogenetic reconstruction of using WGS data of
samples used for genotyping technical validation. The polyprotein coding
sequences of the 120 clinical samples representing the subtype diversity in the
United Kingdom were aligned together with 166 HCV reference sequences from
the Los Alamos HCV database. The MSA was used for reconstruction of a
maximum-likelihood tree using FastTree software under GTR nucleotide
substitution model. Green branches = clinical sample sequences where subtype
assignment was concordant between WGS and “gold standard” methods; red
branches = clinical sample sequences where subtype assignment was discordant
between WGS and “gold standard” methods; blue branches = clinical sample
sequences where WGS classified it as “novel” subtype but “gold standard”
methods only identified the genotype but not the subtype; black
branches = reference sequences.
Supplementary Figure S2 | Variant frequency variability between replicates of
patient samples. Bars represent the largest difference in observed variant
frequency along the HCV genome of sample-specific reference sequence between
reproducibility–interrun–replicates (panel A) and repeatability–intrarun–replicates
(panel B) at minimum read depth of 30. Reproducibility experiments were
performed as duplicates whereas repeatability experiments as triplicates.
Supplementary Figure S3 | Genome coverage by serial dilution of clinical
samples used for linearity experiments. Bars indicate HCV polyprotein coverage
across neat (1) and four three-fold dilutions (2, 3, 4, and 5) of four clinical samples.
Blue = sample #1, orange = sample #2, gray = sample #3 and yellow = sample #4.
