INTRODUCTION
In mammals, liver is a central organ for controlling the metabol￾ic homeostasis for carbohydrates, lipid, and proteins. Dysregula￾tion of liver functions could lead to the metabolic disorder that is 
ultimately detrimental to the health of individuals. Recently, the 
increased incidence of obesity is recognized as a major cause for 
the promotion of metabolic diseases including non-alcoholic fatty 
liver diseases (NAFLD), which is not only linked with other meta￾bolic diseases such as diabetes, but also invoke more severe liver 
diseases including non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), hepatic 
cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).1
NAFLD can be characterized by the increased accumulation of 
lipid in the liver, which can be stemmed from the multiple factors. 
Increased lipolysis from the fat cells or the increased intake of di￾etary fat, followed by the enhancement of free fatty acids (FFA) 
can explain this phenomenon.2
 Mitochondrial dysfunction that is 
associated with insulin resistance, which normally precedes the 
NAFLD, could also cause lipid accumulation by impairment of fatty 
acid beta oxidation.3
 In addition, de novo lipogenesis in the liver 
contributes greatly to the hepatic steatosis.4
 Finally, reduction in 
lipid clearance that is often associated with insulin resistance can 
also exacerbate the condition (Fig. 1).5

Liver plays a central role in the biogenesis of major metabolites including glucose, fatty acids, and cholesterol. 
Increased incidence of obesity in the modern society promotes insulin resistance in the peripheral tissues in humans, 
and could cause severe metabolic disorders by inducing accumulation of lipid in the liver, resulting in the progression 
of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD, which is characterized by increased fat depots in the liver, could 
precede more severe diseases such as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), cirrhosis, and in some cases hepatocellular 
carcinoma. Accumulation of lipid in the liver can be traced by increased uptake of free fatty acids into the liver, impaired 
fatty acid beta oxidation, or the increased incidence of de novo lipogenesis. In this review, I would like to focus on the 
roles of individual pathways that contribute to the hepatic steatosis as a precursor for the NAFLD. (Clin Mol Hepatol

hepatic insulin resistance by generation of lipid-derived second 
messengers such as diacylglycerol (DAG) and ceramides.6
 Further￾more, lipid accumulation in the liver is also linked with the pro￾gression of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress), mitochondria 
stress, and impaired autophagy, resulting in the condition known 
as lipotoxicity.7
 This latter event can cause the immune response 
in the Kupffer cells and hepatic stellate cells, which leads to the 
progression of NASH, hepatic cirrhosis, and in some severe cases, 
hepatocellular carcinoma.
In this review, we would like to delineate the molecular mecha￾nism for lipid accumulation in the liver as a major precursor for the 
NAFLD. In particular, we will delineate the individual mechanisms 
for the triglycerides (TG) synthesis and clearance that is critical in 
mediating lipid homeostasis in the liver both under physiological 
conditions and pathological conditions. Understanding of the mo￾lecular basis of these pathways could shed the insight into the po￾tential therapeutics in the treatment of this disease.
Fatty acids uptake
Free fatty acids (FFA) in the plasma can be taken up by the liver, 
and serve as important sources for the TG synthesis in the liver. 
Normally, plasma FFA is generated by white adipocytes via lipoly￾sis, which is induced by beta adrenergic receptor agonists such as 
catecholamine under fasting conditions.8
 This process involves the 
regulation of protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent phosphorylation 
and activation of hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), a key rate limit￾ing enzyme in the lipolysis, to promote this pathway. This pathway 
is reversed by insulin under feeding conditions, limiting the libera￾tion of FFA and rather inducing de novo lipogenesis in this tissue. 
Upon insulin resistance that is associated with obesity, lipolysis is 
hyperactivated in adipocytes, resulting in the increases in plasma 
FFA.9
 In addition, since obesity is often associated with increased 
uptake of nutrition rich in lipid, we would expect to observe high￾er levels of precursors for TG synthesis in the liver. 
The main plasma membrane transporters for FFA are fatty acid 
transporter protein (FATP), caveolins, fatty acid translocase (FAT)/
CD36, and fatty acid binding protein (FABP). In mammals 6 mem￾bers of FATPs are found that contain a common motif for fatty 
acid uptake and fatty acyl-CoA synthetase function.10 Among fam￾ily members, FATP2 and FATP5 are highly expressed in the liver, 
and utilized as major FATPs for the normal physiological context. 
Indeed, FATP5 knockout mice showed resistance to diet-induced 
obesity and hepatic TG accumulation, although no clinical evi￾dence for the involvement of this FATP isoform in human obesity.11
Caveolins consist of three protein family members termed caveo￾lins 1, 2, and 3, and are found in the membrane structures called 
caveolae, which are important for protein trafficking and the for￾mation of lipid droplets.12 Caveolin-1 knockout mice exhibited 
lower TG accumulation in the liver and showed resistance to diet￾induced obesity, showing the importance of this protein in the TG 
synthesis under obesity. FAT/CD36 is a transmembrane protein 
that accelerates FA uptake via facilitated diffusion.13 Normally, this 
protein is not highly expressed in the liver, but is enhanced by diet￾induced obesity. The hepatic expression of CD36 was positively 
correlated with hepatic TG contents in NAFLD patients, underscor￾ing the potential importance of this transporter with this disease.14
FABPs are cytosolic lipid binding proteins that facilitate intracellu￾lar transport of FFAs.15 Among 9 isoforms, FABP1 and FABP5 are 
highly expressed in the liver. Mice with liver-specific deletion of 
FABP1 displayed resistance to diet-induced obesity, although he￾patic TG accumulation did not differ from that of wild type mice, 
suggesting that contributions from other FABPs might be critical in 
hepatic TG accumulation in this state.16 Indeed, expression of 
FABP4 and FABP5 in the liver was correlated with hepatic fatty in￾filtration in NAFLD patients.17 Further study is necessary to inte￾grate roles of these fatty acid transporters in the hepatic FFA up￾take under the physiological conditions and the pathological 
conditions.
Figure 1. Model for the TG accumulation in the liver in the early stage 
of NAFLD. Hepatic steatosis can be stimulated via increased fatty acid 
uptake, increased de novo lipogenesis, and decreased fatty acid 
oxidation followed by esterification for the TG synthesis. Additionally, 
decreases in VLDL secretion can also contribute to the lipid 
accumulation in the liver. See texts for the molecular mechanisms in 
detail.

De novo lipogenesis
De novo lipogenesis is an integrated metabolic pathway that 
comprises of glycolysis (conversion of glucose to acetyl-CoA), bio￾synthesis of saturated fatty acid followed by desaturation, and the 
formation of TG. Key rate limiting enzymes in the process include 
glucokinase and liver-type pyruvate kinase in the glycolysis, acetyl￾CoA carboxylase (ACC) and fatty acid synthase (FAS) in the fatty 
acid synthesis, long chain fatty acid elongase 6 (ELOVL6) and 
stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) in the formation of monounsatu￾rated fatty acids, and glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT), 
lipins, and acyl-CoA: diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) in the 
formation of TG.18
FAS is a rate-limiting enzyme in the fatty acid biosynthesis and 
catalyzes the last step in this pathway.19 Liver-specific knockout of 
FAS in mice, however, displayed fatty liver phenotypes upon high 
carbohydrate diet, perhaps due to the increase in hepatic malonyl￾CoA contents that would inhibit fatty acid beta oxidation.20 ACC 
not only catalyzes a key rate-limiting step in the fatty acid biosyn￾thesis, but also is involved in the control of fatty acid oxidation by 
synthesis of malonyl-CoA, an inhibitor for carnitine palmitoyl 
transferase 1 (CPT1).21 Indeed, inhibition of liver-specific isoform 
ACC1 in mice reduced hepatic TG levels in mice, by simultaneously 
inhibiting fatty acid biosynthesis and activating fatty acid beta oxi￾dation in the liver.19 SCD1 is a microsomal enzyme that catalyses 
the formation of monounsaturated long-chain fatty acids from 
saturated fatty acyl-CoAs (E.g. conversion of palmitoyl-CoA (16:0) 
to palmitoleoyl-CoA (16:1 n-7), and stearoyl-CoA (18:0) to oleoyl￾CoA (18:1 n-9)), and is predominantly expressed in the liver.22 De￾pletion of SCD1 in mice resulted in the reversal of hepatic steatosis 
under western diet due to the decreased lipogenesis and increased 
fatty acid beta oxidation.23 DGAT catalyzes the final step of TG 
synthesis by catalyzing the acylation of diacylglycerol (DAG).24 In￾activation of hepatic isoform DGAT2 in obese mice resulted in the 
significant reduction in hepatic TG contents, showing the in vivo 
evidence for the importance of this protein in the de novo lipogen￾esis.25
Two major transcription factors for lipogenesis, sterol regulatory 
element binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c) and carbohydrate response 
element binding protein (ChREBP), are involved in the transcrip￾tional activation of genes encoding aforementioned rate-limiting 
enzymes in the lipogenesis, and have been associated with in￾creased de novo lipogenesis in NAFLD.4
 SREBP-1c is a member of 
SREBP family that control transcriptional regulation of lipid metab￾olism.26 As ER-bound precursors, full-length SREBPs reside in the 
ER by using its transmembrane domain in the middle. Transport of 
SREBPs from the ER to the Golgi apparatus is mediated in part by 
nutrient sensors SCAP and Insig, and the mature form of SREBPs 
is generated by two consecutive proteolytic cleavages. The expres￾sion of SREBP-1c is highly induced by insulin under feeding condi￾tions and by saturated fatty acids upon high fat diet feeding in 
mice, and the liver X receptor alpha (LXR alpha) is shown to be 
critical in the transcriptional activation of SREBP-1c in this pro￾cess.27 The activity of SREBP-1c can be further activated by mam￾malian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, while it can be inhib￾ited by PKA, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and salt 
inducible kinases (SIKs).28-30 ChREBP was first identified as a regu￾lator for the hepatic glycolysis by activating transcription of L-PK 
gene, and was later shown to be involved in the regulation of oth￾er lipogenic genes in the pathway.31 At low glucose conditions, 
ChREBP is present in the cytosol by PKA-mediated phosphoryla￾tion, but undergoes dephosphorylation, association with its het￾erodimeric partner Mlx, and nuclear localization at high glucose 
conditions, resulting in the transcriptional activation of target 
genes in the liver. The additional role of AMPK in the regulation of 
ChREBP was also suggested, although the exact mechanism is still 
verified in vivo yet. In obese, insulin-resistant ob/ob mice, both 
SREBP-1c and ChREBP are highly abundant in the liver, and reduc￾tion of either factor was shown to be beneficial in relieving hepatic 
steatosis in mice, underscoring the importance of these lipogenic 
transcription factors in de novo lipogenesis and the TG accumula￾tion in the liver.32,33
Fatty acid oxidative pathways
Fatty acid beta oxidation in mitochondria is a process to shorten 
the fatty acids into acetyl-CoA, which can be later converted into 
ketone bodies (beta hydroxybutyrate or acetoacetate) or can be 
incorporated into the TCA cycle for the full oxidation.34 To initiate 
the process, fatty acyl-CoAs should be transported across the mi￾tochondrial membranes by activity of a couple of CPTs. Fatty acyl￾CoAs are converted to fatty acyl-carnitines by CPT1 in the mito￾chondrial outer membrane for the translocation into the 
intermembrane space. Fatty acyl-carnitines are then transported 
across the mitochondrial outer membrane by carnitine acylcarni￾tine translocase. CPT2 converts fatty acyl-carnitines to fatty acyl￾CoAs for the fatty acid beta oxidation inside the mitochondrial 
matrix. The first step involves the beta dehydrogenation of the ac￾yl-CoA ester by chain length-specific acyl-CoA dehydrogenases 
(e.g. VLCAD, LCAD, and MCAD). Indeed, mice deficient in MCAD

and VLCAD develop hepatic steatosis, supporting the role of these 
proteins and the fatty acid beta oxidation in the hepatic TG con￾tent.35 2-enoyl-CoA hydratase, 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase 
and 3-oxoacyl-CoA thiolase are subsequently involved in the fatty 
acid beta oxidation process to complete the conversion of acyl￾CoA ester into acetyl-CoA. 
Under fasting conditions, fatty acid beta oxidation is enhanced 
in part via inactivation of ACC, resulting in the reduced production 
of malonyl-CoA that serves as a potent inhibitor of CPT1.21 Chronic 
starvation also increases expression of beta oxidation genes via 
transcriptional mechanisms. Peroxisome proliferator-activated re￾ceptor (PPAR) alpha and its co-activator PPAR gamma co-activator 
1 (PGC-1) alpha are critical in enhancing expression of target 
genes including CPT1, LCAD, MCAD, and acyl-CoA oxidase 
(ACOX).36 Starvation-dependent activation of AMPK and sirtuins 
could also enhance expression of these genes by directly modify￾ing and activating PGC-1 alpha.37,38 The clinical implication of im￾paired mitochondrial beta oxidation on the progression of NAFLD 
is not conclusive, and contradicting reports have been published. 
Further study is necessary to delineate the role of fatty acid beta 
oxidation on hepatic lipid accumulation and the progression of 
NAFLD.39
TG secretion
In the liver, TG secretion is achieved via the formation of very 
low density lipoprotein (VLDL).40 VLDL consists of hydrophobic 
core lipids containing TGs and cholesterol esters, which is covered 
by hydrophilic phospholipids and apolipoprotein B (apoB) 100. 
ApoB 100 is a liver-specific ApoB that is critical in the VLDL as￾sembly, while apoB 48 in the intestine is associated with chylomi￾cron formation. The VLDL assembly process occurs initially in the 
rough ER during the translation and translocation of the apoB 
100, resulting in the formation of a partially lipidated apoB 100. 
The partially lipidated apoB 100, termed the pre-VLDL is then 
transported into the Golgi for the maturation, and subsequently 
released from the liver via exocytosis. Indeed, hepatic steatosis 
was reported in patients carrying mutations in apoB 100 (hypo￾betalipoproteinemia) and in MTP (abetalipoproteinemia), under￾scoring the importance of these proteins in the lipid homeostasis 
in humans.41,42
Anabolic hormone insulin is critical in the regulation of VLDL as￾sembly and secretion. Insulin plays a role in the degradation of 
apoB 100, perhaps utilizing an autophagy-dependent pathway.43 
Furthermore, insulin inhibits the transcription of MTP, by phospha￾tidylinositol 3 kinase/Akt-dependent regulation. Akt phosphory￾lates and inhibits transcription factor FoxA2, a critical forkhead 
box factor for activating expression of MTP at the transcription 
level.44,45 Upon insulin resistance, perturbation of this process re￾sults in hypertriglyceridemia via increased TG secretion. However, 
the rate of TG secretion cannot keep up with the increased rate of 
TG synthesis in this condition, resulting in the hepatic steatosis in 
spite of the increased VLDL secretion. Similar phenotype is ob￾served in NAFLD patients, which exhibit both hypertriglyceridemia 
and hepatic steatosis.46 Prolonged exposure of the liver to FFA 
would promotes ER stress and other oxidative stress in the liver, 
leading to the degradation of apoB 100, decrease in the VLDL se￾cretion, and worsening of hepatic steatosis. 
CONCLUSIONS
The balance between the TG uptake/synthesis and TG hydroly￾sis/secretion is critical in the maintenance of lipid homeostasis in 
the liver. Clearly, perturbation of any of these pathways could be 
detrimental to the lipid metabolism. In the case of NAFLD, the 
progression of hepatic steatosis can stem from the increased FFA 
uptake and de novo lipogenesis for the increased TG synthesis, 
and the decreased TG hydrolysis and fatty acid beta oxidation. Re￾duced TG secretion via VLDL could also promote hepatic lipid ac￾cumulation, although the VLDL secretion was rather increased in 
NAFLD patients. Understanding of molecular mechanisms of each 
pathway is critical in pursuing the development of therapeutics of 
NAFLD in the future.
