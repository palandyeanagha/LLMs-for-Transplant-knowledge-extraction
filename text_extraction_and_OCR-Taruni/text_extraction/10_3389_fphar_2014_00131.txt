Fibrosis is the excessive deposition of extracellular matrix proteins into tissues leading
to scar formation, disruption of normal tissue architecture and organ failure. Despite
the large clinical impact of fibrosis, treatment options are limited. Adhesion molecules,
in particular αvβ6 and α3β1 integrins and cadherin-11, have been demonstrated to be
important mediators of tissue fibrosis. These data are reviewed here and provide the
foundation for these molecules to be potential therapeutic targets for patients with fibrotic
diseases.

INTRODUCTION
Fibrosis is the excessive deposition of extracellular matrix proteins
into tissues leading to scar formation, disruption of normal tissue
architecture and organ failure (Wynn, 2008; Wei et al., 2011a).
Fibrosis is the final common pathway of a tissue’s response to
injury, including chemical exposures, infections, and autoimmu￾nity. Multiple tissues in the body can be affected by fibrosis,
with the majority of research focusing on lung, kidney, liver and
skin fibrosis. The overall clinical impact of fibrosis is large, with
some reports suggesting that up to 45% of deaths in the indus￾trial world can be attributed to fibrosis (Wynn, 2008). Despite its
importance, current treatment options are extremely limited and
largely supportive rather than curative. Pirfenidone has shown
promise in the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (Noble
et al., 2011) and other targets are at various stages of development
(Chakraborty et al., 2014). However, the clinical need for ther￾apeutic interventions in fibrotic diseases is still clearly present.
Therefore, understanding the cellular and molecular pathways
that lead to the development of tissue fibrosis is critical to identify
potential therapeutic targets
Current paradigms indicate that epithelial cells, macrophages,
T-cells, and fibroblasts all contribute to the development of tis￾sue fibrosis (Wynn, 2008; Wei et al., 2011a). Injured epithelial
cells become reprogrammed, initiating and propagating mes￾enchymal pathways, most notable of which are TGFβ related
pathways (Camelo et al., 2014). Macrophages also contribute
to the early inflammatory process and subsequently the fibrotic
process through the production of profibrotic cytokines and
growth factors, including TGFβ, that recruit and activate fibrob￾lasts (Denholm and Rollins, 1993; Atabai et al., 2009; Pesce et al.,
2009; Mathai et al., 2010). Ultimately these processes lead to the
accumulation of activated fibroblasts and myofibroblasts at the
sites of fibrosis. Myofibroblasts are key producers of the extracel￾lular matrix that is laid down during development tissue fibrosis
(Hinz et al., 2007; Wynn, 2008). The collagen and extracellular
matrix deposition replaces the normal tissue architecture which
in turn leads to organ dysfunction. The source of fibroblasts and
myofibroblasts is very controversial and potentially includes res￾ident fibroblasts, bone marrow derived mesenchymal precursors
(fibrocytes), and epithelial cells [via the process of epithelial-to￾mesenchymal transition (EMT)] (Kim et al., 2006, 2009a; Tanjore
et al., 2009; Degryse et al., 2010; Chapman, 2011; Rock et al.,
2011). The relative contributions of three potential sources may
differ depending on the underlying stimulus, the tissue undergo￾ing fibrosis and the mouse model of fibrosis. Regardless of the
controversy over cellular origins, the molecular pathways that
govern these processes are similar. TGFβ is considered to be
the central mediator of fibrosis, but the cytokines (IL4, IL-13,
IL-6), chemokines (CCL2), PDGF, Wnt signaling pathway, and
beta-catenin, also contribute to the fibrotic response (Varga and
Pasche, 2009; Varga and Whitfield, 2009; Lam et al., 2011; Wei
et al., 2011b, 2012). In the current review, we will discuss how the
cellular adhesion molecules, namely the integrins and cadherins,
may contribute to the development of tissue fibrosis.
CELLULAR ADHESION MOLECULES
The ability of cells to adhere to each other and to interact with
the extracellular matrix through cellular adhesion molecules is
important in regulating a variety of biological processes including
tissue remodeling and inflammation. Cellular adhesion molecules
have been classified into four families (selectins, immunoglobulin
superfamily, integrins, and cadherins) based on their molecular
structure. The current review will only focus on integrins and
cadherins as they relate to the development of tissue fibrosis. A
more detailed discussion of each family can be obtained in sev￾eral excellent reviews (Springer, 1994; Petruzzelli et al., 1999;
Hynes, 2002; Patel et al., 2002; Wheelock and Johnson, 2003a;
ffrench-Constant and Colognato, 2004; Humphries et al., 2006).
Integrins are a large family of transmembrane adhesive pro￾teins that influence a wide array of biologic processes including

tissue organization and inflammation (reviewed in Hynes,
2002; ffrench-Constant and Colognato, 2004). Integrins are het￾erodimeric glycoproteins consisting of an alpha- and a beta-chain.
Each subunit contains a long extracellular domain, a trans￾membrane region and cytoplasmic domain capable of connect￾ing to the actin cytoskeleton and triggering signal transduction
events into the cell. There are currently 18 alpha subunits and 8
beta subunits, which can combine to form 24 different integrin
heterodimers. Integrins can be further classified into: arginine￾glycine-aspartate (RGD) binding integrins, the α-4 integrins,
leukocyte adhesion integrins, laminin-binding integrins, and I￾domain collagen binding integrins. On the extracellular surface,
integrins can interact with other adhesion molecules, such as the
immunoglobulin superfamily members and cadherins, growth
factor receptors, and the extracellular matrix. In addition to link￾ing the extracellular environment of the cell to the actin cytoskele￾ton, the cytoplasmic tail of integrins also serves as an anchor for
a large number of signaling molecules. Therefore, integrins are
capable of regulating cell behavior through a number of differ￾ent pathways and mechanisms. As a result, integrins are involved
in a large spectrum of human health and diseases, including
thrombotic, infectious, malignant, and inflammatory diseases
(Goodman and Picard, 2012). We will discuss the importance
some of the integrins in the fibrosis.
Cadherins are a family of adhesion molecules that mediate
homophilic, calcium-dependent cellular adhesion by binding a
cadherin of the same type on an adjacent cell (homophilic adhe￾sion) (Takeichi, 1990; Wheelock and Johnson, 2003a; Goodwin
and Yap, 2004). Classical cadherins possess five extracellular
domains, a single pass transmembrane domain and a highly con￾served cytoplasmic tail (Boggon et al., 2002). The cytoplasmic tail
interacts with beta-catenin, which in turn binds alpha-catenin,
forming a linkage between the cadherin-catenin complex and the
actin cytoskeleton (Horikawa et al., 1999). The spatiotemporal
expression pattern of cadherins during embryogenesis is critical
in cell migration, cell differentiation and tissue morphogenesis.
In the postnatal environment, cadherins play a role in the main￾tenance of tissue architecture (Hermiston and Gordon, 1995).
Cadherins have functions that extend beyond cell-to-cell adhe￾sion. Cadherins are linked to multiple intracellular signaling
pathways, including WNT, PI-3 kinase/Akt and FGF pathways
(Nakagawa and Takeichi, 1998; Suyama et al., 2002; Tran et al.,
2002). Furthermore, cadherins have been implicated in malig￾nant transformation and tumor invasiveness (Shibata et al., 1996;
Hazan et al., 1997, 2000; Pishvaian et al., 1999; Tomita et al., 2000;
Wheelock et al., 2001).During the process of malignant transfor￾mation and EMT, epithelial cells become more invasive, which
is associated with the down-regulation of E-cadherin and up￾regulation of mesenchymal cadherins such as N-cadherin and
cadherin-11 (Hazan et al., 1997, 2000). Finally, cadherins have
also been implicated in regulating inflammation and cartilage
damage in mouse models of inflammatory arthritis (Lee et al.,
2007; Park et al., 2011). Together, these studies demonstrate an
important role for cadherins in health and diseases. In the cur￾rent review, we will discuss recent studies implicating cadherins
in the pathogenesis of fibrosis.
ALPHA-V INTEGRIN REGULATION OF TGFβ DURING
FIBROSIS
TGFβ is one of the key growth factors involved in the fibrotic pro￾cess. There are three isoforms of TGFβ (TGFβ1, −2, −3). The
gene for TGFβ encodes a precursor protein, consisting of a C￾terminal TGFβ molecule and an N-terminal region that encodes
a protein called the latency-associated peptide (LAP). The pre￾cursor protein is cleaved followed by a noncovalent association of
these peptides to form the small latent complex (SLC, Figure 1A).
The SLC subsequently associates with latent TGFβ–binding pro￾teins (LTBP) in the extracellular matrix to form the large latent
complex (LLC, Figure 1A). TGFβ in the context of the LLC is
secreted from the cell and remains hidden in its inactive state
in the extracellular matrix. Activation of TGFβ in the extracel￾lular matrix is required for TGFβ to activate its receptors and is
FIGURE 1 | Mechanisms of TGFβ activation by αvβ6 integrin. (A) LAP
forms a straightjacket around TGFβ in the small latent complex (SLC)
and binds to LTBP to for the large latent complex (LLC). The LTBP is
in turn tethered to the extracellular matrix. (B) The cell associated αvβ6
integrin binds to the RGD domains of LAP, pulling the LAP ope against
the resistance provided by the extracellular matrix/LTBP interaction. (C)
TGFβ is then released from the LAP, allowing it to interact with its
receptor.

thought to be an important regulatory step in the development
of fibrosis. Changes in pH, changes in temperature, reactive oxy￾gen species and protease activation by plasmin, thrombospondin
1 may activate TGFβ.
The effects of TGFβ are pleiotropic and can vary significantly
depending on the context within which it is expressed. During
the fibrotic process, TGFβ1 promotes collagen production by
fibroblasts, can induce EMT and myofibroblast differentiation,
and cellular migration. However, TGFβ1 deficient mice develop
diffuse, multifocal mononuclear inflammation resulting in mor￾tality due to cardiopulmonary complications (Shull et al., 1992).
Therefore, despite its critical importance in fibrosis, systemic
and direct inhibition of TGFβ in fibrosis may not be the ideal
approach to the treatment of fibrosis. Rather indirect approaches,
as discussed below, may allow more targeted inhibition of TGFβ
in fibrosis.
RGD-binding integrins, including the αv integrins, have been
reported to activate latent TGFβ (Munger et al., 1998, 1999).
Human LAP-β1 and LAP-β2 contains an RGD motif, suggest￾ing that they may interact with RGD-binding integrins. Indeed
several αv integrins, including αvb1, αvb3, αvb5, and αvβ6 inte￾grins, have been shown to bind to LAP-β1 and LAP-β2 (Munger
et al., 1998, 1999). Furthermore, αvβ6 integrin has been shown
to activate latent TGFβ The activation of TGFβ by αvβ6 is depen￾dent on an intact cytoskeleton, implying that mechanical force
generated by the integrin can alter the structure of the LAP in
the SLP of TGFβ. A recent crystallographic analysis of the SLC
of TGFβ confirmed this hypothesis (Figure 1) (Shi et al., 2011)
These data suggest that LAP forms a straightjacket around TGFβ
while binding to the LTBP via a disulfide bond. At the same time,
the LTBP interacts with the extracellular matrix. The cell asso￾ciated αvβ6 integrin binds to the RGD domains of LAP, pulling
the LAP open against the resistance provided by the extracellu￾lar matrix/LTBP interaction, activating TGFβ by releasing it and
allowing it to interact with its receptor.
The expression of αvβ6 integrin has been described on type
II alveolar epithelial cells of patients with idiopathic pulmonary
fibrosis and scleroderma lung fibrosis (Horan et al., 2008).
Murine studies have demonstrated αvβ6 integrin expression is
markedly upregulated by injury and inflammation in the lung
as well (Munger et al., 1999). The central importance of alveo￾lar epithelial cells in fibrosis has recently been reviewed (Camelo
et al., 2014). Consistent with a potential role for αvβ6 integrin on
epithelial cells in the development of fibrosis is the observation
that β6 null mice are protected from lung fibrosis in the intra￾tracheal bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis model, even though the
β6 null mice suffer from an exaggerated pulmonary inflammatory
response (Munger et al., 1999). These data were further confirmed
using an anti- αvβ6 integrin antibody, which attenuated collagen
expression and fibrosis in the intratracheal bleomycin-induced
lung fibrosis model (Horan et al., 2008). In addition an impor￾tant role for αvβ6 in the development of lung fibrosis has been
demonstrated using β6 null mice and an anti- αvβ6 integrin anti￾body in the radiation-induced lung fibrosis mouse model and the
TGFα induced lung fibrosis model (Puthawala et al., 2008; Madala
et al., 2014). Finally, the role of αvβ6 integrin in renal fibrosis in
the unilateral ureteral obstruction model and acute biliary fibrosis
has also been shown, once again demonstrating commonalities of
fibrosis in the different tissues (Ma et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2007).
The studies described above demonstrate an important role for
the αvβ6 intergin in the development of tissue fibrosis. However,
αvβ6 integrin may not be involved in all forms of fibrosis as
noted by the lack of an effect in the carbon tetrachloride (CCL4)-
induced liver fibrosis model. This may be due to the expression
pattern of αvβ6 integrin or the ability of multiple beta integrin
partners with the αv chain. It has been shown that myofibrob￾lasts express αv integrins not associated with the β6 chain, several
of which are capable of activating latent TGFβ. Accordingly, a
recent study reported that αv integrin depletion in liver hep￾atic stellate cells and myofibroblasts using the PDGF receptor
Cre promoter and loxP flanked αv integrin, protected mice from
CCL4-induced liver fibrosis (Henderson et al., 2013). These data
were confirmed using a small molecule inhibitor of αv inte￾grin. In addition, several studies have demonstrated expression
of αvβ3 and αvβ5 integrins on dermal fibroblasts and in skin
biopsies of systemic sclerosis patients, suggesting that multiple
αv integrins, other than only the αvβ6 intergin, may play a role
in skin fibrosis (Asano et al., 2005a,b, 2006a,b). Together these
studies identify αv integrins as important mediators of tissue
fibrosis through the activation of latent TGFβ and suggest that
αv integrins may be therapeutic targets in patients with tissue
fibrosis.
INTEGRIN-CADHERIN CROSS-TALK IN FIBROSIS
Injury to the alveolar epithelial cells is a key event in the develop￾ment of lung fibrosis (Camelo et al., 2014). As discussed above,
epithelial damage activates TGFβ through αv integrins. TGFβ
then drives fibrosis though activation of fibroblasts and myofi￾broblast differentiation. Whether epithelial cells are also directly
a source of myofibroblasts in the fibrotic tissue, through the pro￾cess of EMT, remains controversial. Inhibition of EMT has been
suggested as a therapeutic strategy but it remains unclear if the
success of EMT inhibition observed in vitro translates to the
in vivo (Wang et al., 2010; Jang et al., 2013). However, epithe￾lial cells in fibrotic lungs activate mesenchymal gene programs,
including the Wnt signaling pathway and β-catenin (Chilosi et al.,
2003; Konigshoff et al., 2008). Consistent with this, inhibition of
Wnt and β-catenin signaling decreases the development of tissue
fibrosis (Bayle et al., 2008; Bergmann et al., 2011; Beyer et al.,
2012; Wei et al., 2012).
Beta-catenin regulates cell-to-cell adhesion and gene tran￾scription through its interactions with cadherins and Wnt
signaling. In the absence of Wnt signaling, β-catenin is serine
phosphorylated by glycogen synthase kinase, which then des￾ignates it for proteosomal degradation. If the Wnt pathway is
activated, β-catenin translocates to the nucleus and activates gene
transcription. Beta-catenin also regulates cell-to-cell adhesion
through binding to a highly conserved region on the cytoplasmic
tail of cadherins. This association is reduced by tyrosine phos￾phorylation of β-catenin, which in turn makes β-catenin available
to join the cytoplasmic pool and translocate to the nucleus to
regulate gene transcription (Roura et al., 1999). Thus, a balance
between the cytoplasmic and the cadherin-associated pools of
β-catenin exists. Interestingly, TGFβ may alter this balance and

Agarwal Integrins and cadherins as therapeutic targets in fibrosis
has been shown to increase β-catenin mediated signaling in the
nucleus (Masszi et al., 2004).
More recently, the α3β1 integrin has also been shown to reg￾ulate the β-catenin pool through interactions with E-cadherin
(Kim et al., 2009a).Immune fluorescent studies demonstrated
that α3β1 integrin co-localizes with E-cadherin. Biochemical
studies in alveolar epithelial cells also have demonstrated that
α3β1 integrin physically associates with E-cadherin and the TGFβ
receptor (Kim et al., 2009a,b). This tri-molecular complex of
α3β1 integrin, E-cadherin and the TGFβ receptor results in the
tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin at position Y654, but not
serine phosphorylation. pY654 β-catenin subsequently associates
with pSmad2 (a TGFβ signaling molecule) and then translocates
to the nucleus where it can regulate transcription. Interestingly,
these pY654 beta-catenin-pSmad2 complexes have been identified
in mouse fibrotic lungs as well as fibrotic lungs from idiopathic
pulmonary fibrosis patients but not lungs from healthy or emphy￾sematous patients. These data suggest a role for α3β1 integrin
in the development of lung fibrosis through interaction with
E-cadherin and downstream β-catenin signaling.
Support for this hypothesis has come from both in vitro
and in vivo studies. In vitro studies have demonstrated that
alveolar epithelial cells from α3 integrin chain deficient mice
have decreased mesenchymal gene expression when plated on
fibronectin, a known inducer of EMT (Kim et al., 2009a,b).
Most important are the in vivo studies, which demonstrated that
mice with selective loss of expression of the α3 integrin chain
in epithelial cells have attenuated lung fibrosis in the intratra￾cheal bleomycin lung fibrosis model (Kim et al., 2009a). Together
these data support a role for the α3β1 integrin in fibrosis (likely
through its interaction with cadherins and β-catenin), and sug￾gest that α3β1 integrin targeting may be a therapeutic option in
fibrosis.
CADHERIN REGULATION OF FIBROSIS
Cadherins are important determinants of cell fate with impor￾tant roles during both development and postnatally (Wheelock
and Johnson, 2003a,b). E-cadherin is expressed on epithelial cells
while other cadherins, including N-cadherin and cadherin-11, are
expressed on mesenchymal cells including fibroblasts. Changes in
the expression patterns of cadherins are an important determi￾nant in the phenotype of malignant cells (Nieman et al., 1999;
Pishvaian et al., 1999). Accordingly, the expression of cadherin-11
and N-cadherin and the loss of expression of E-cadherin confers a
mesenchymal and invasive phenotype in breast cancer and other
cancer cell lines (Hazan et al., 1997; Nieman et al., 1999; Pishvaian
et al., 1999). EMT transition has been hypothesized to be one of
the mechanisms that underlie the cadherin switch in these cells.
With regards to fibrosis, the role of cadherins has been indi￾rectly considered and focused on E-cadherin, where its expression
is lost on epithelial cells during the development of fibrosis
(Tanjore et al., 2009). The increase in N-cadherin has also been
tracked in alveolar epithelial cells hypothesized to be undergo￾ing EMT (Tanjore et al., 2009). However, it is not clear from the
literature if the changes in E-cadherin or N-cadherin are mecha￾nistically involved in the development of fibrosis. More recently,
cadherin-11, another mesenchymal cadherin, has been shown to
be increased in fibrotic tissue and studied in the context of fibrosis
(Schneider et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2014).
Cadherin-11 is a type-II mesenchymal cadherin initially
identified in osteoblast cell lines but subsequently noted to be
expressed in neural tissue, lung, and kidney (Okazaki et al., 1994;
Hoffmann and Balling, 1995). Aberrant expression of cadherin￾11 in malignant cells, including breast cancer and prostate cancer,
is associated with a more invasive and metastatic phenotype
(Shibata et al., 1996; Pishvaian et al., 1999; Tomita et al., 2000).
Subsequent studies have also shown cadherin-11 expression
on fibroblasts within the synovial lining of joints where it may
regulate invasion and the production of interleukin-6 and matrix
metalloproteinases (Lee et al., 2007; Chang et al., 2011; Noss
et al., 2011). Interestingly, in vivo studies have demonstrated
that cadherin-11 deficient mice have an attenuation in synovial
inflammation in the KBxN serum transfer arthritis model,
suggesting that cadherin-11 may be a therapeutic target for
human inflammatory arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis (Lee
et al., 2007).
More recently, a potential role of cadherin-11 in lung and
dermal fibrosis has been postulated. This interest was stimu￾lated by observations that cadherin-11 is expressed on multiple
fibroblast populations, including dermal and lung fibroblasts, and
two independent microarray studies of systemic sclerosis skin
biopsies demonstrated increased cadherin-11 mRNA levels in
fibrotic skin (Whitfield et al., 2003; Gardner et al., 2006). The
increase in cadherin-11 expression in fibrotic tissue was subse￾quently confirmed using multiple techniques in systemic sclerosis
skin biopsies and fibrotic lung tissue from patients with idio￾pathic pulmonary fibrosis (Schneider et al., 2012; Wu et al.,
2014). Using murine models of skin and lung fibrosis, it is now
evident that the increase in cadherin-11 in fibrotic tissue, is mech￾anistically involved in the development of fibrosis. Accordingly,
cadherin-11 deficient mice have a significant decrease in der￾mal and lung fibrosis when challenged with subcutaneous or
intratracheal bleomycin (Schneider et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2014).
Importantly, anti-cadherin-11 monoclonal antibodies are also
effective in treating existing fibrosis in these models as well
(Schneider et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2014). These data suggest that
the inhibition of cadherin-11 is a potential therapeutic strategy in
patients with fibrosis.
The mechanism by which cadherin-11 regulates fibrosis
remains under investigation. Immunohistochemical studies
have demonstrated that cadherin-11 is not only expressed on
fibroblasts in fibrotic lung tissue, but also macrophages and
hyperplastic type II alveolar epithelial cells (Schneider et al.,
2012). In fibrotic skin, cadherin-11 was also confirmed on fibrob￾lasts and macrophages (Wu et al., 2014). Given the expression of
cadherin-11 on multiple cell populations involved in the develop￾ment of fibrosis, it is likely that cadherin-11 modulates multiple
steps of the fibrotic process, including the macrophage, epithelial
cell and fibroblast (Figure 2). For example, cadherin-11 deficient
macrophages produce less TGFβ, but similar amounts of TNFα,
compared to wild type macrophages (Schneider et al., 2012; Wu
et al., 2014). Furthermore, inhibition of cadherin-11 expression
in lung epithelial cell lines blocked mesenchymal gene expression
and EMT in vitro (Schneider et al., 2012). Finally cadherin-11 has

fibrosis cadherin-11 expression is noted on fibroblasts, myofibroblasts,

been shown to regulate dermal fibroblast migration and the levels
of β-catenin, both of which are important in the development
of tissue fibrosis (Wu et al., 2014). Therefore, combined with the
in vivo murine studies, cadherin-11 appears to be an important
mediator of tissue fibrosis and inhibition of cadherin-11 function
is a potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of tissue
fibrosis.
CONCLUSIONS
The understanding of the development of tissue fibrosis has
greatly expanded in recent years. Many of these pathways are
shared in the different tissues that develop fibrosis, including the
lung, skin, liver, and kidney. The clinical implications of fibrosis
are substantial, however to date disease-modifying therapies have
not been developed and approved. Integrins, in particular the αv
and α3β1 integrins, as well as cadherins, in particular cadherin￾11, appear to be important mediators of tissue fibrosis in mul￾tiple mouse models. Our understanding of how these adhesion
molecules modulates the behavior of key cells that contribute to
fibrosis, including the epithelial cell, macrophage, fibroblast and
myofibroblast continues to expand. The targeting of αv and α3β1
integrins and cadherin-11 may allow more targeted inhibition of
important fibrotic pathways such as TGFb and beta-catenin in
the fibrotic tissue, where as general inhibtion of these pathways
may result in too many unintended consequences. The transla￾tion of these observations into treatments is in various stages of
development and clinical trials. Until then, additional insight into
these pathways will continue to shed light into the development
of tissue fibrosis and position us to translate these findings to the
clinical arena as potential therapeutics for fibrotic diseases.
