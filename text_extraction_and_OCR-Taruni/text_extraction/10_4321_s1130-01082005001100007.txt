ABSTRACT
We report the case of a patient that developed hepatic hy￾drothorax as the first complication of liver cirrhosis. Due to the
lack of response to diuretics, pleurodesis and TIPS, treatment with
octreotide was started with resolution of hydrothorax. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the third reported case of refractory he￾patic hydrothorax with complete and sustained response to oc￾treotide.
Key words: Hepatic hydrothorax. Liver cirrhosis. Ascites. TIPS.

INTRODUCTION
Hepatic hydrothorax is an infrequent complication of
liver cirrhosis (5-10%) (1,2). It is defined as pleural effu￾sion greater than 500 ml in patients with liver cirrhosis
and portal hypertension without cardiopulmonary dis￾ease. There are many pathophysiologic theories that try
to explain the mechanism of hepatic hydrothorax. Cur￾rently, the most accepted mechanism, involves the pas￾sage of ascitic fluid from the peritoneal cavity into the
pleural space through diaphragmatic defects (2-4). Pleur￾al effusión meets transudative criteria and is located in
the right hemithorax in 85% of cases (2,3). It is usually
associated with ascites but there are cases of isolated hy￾drothorax (5-7). Initial treatment is similar to that of hy￾dropic decompensation and it consists of fluid and sodi￾um restriction and diuretics. Patients with hydrothorax
refractory to pharmacological treatment can be managed
with pleurodesis or transjugular intrahepatic portosys￾temic shunt (TIPS) (8-13), although liver transplantation
is the definitive treatment (14). Over the last few years,
two cases of successful treatment of hepatic hydrothorax
with octreotide have been reported. This led us to treat
our patient with this drug.
CASE REPORT
A 66-year-old woman, with a past medical history of
cigarette smoking and active alcohol consumption of 70
grams per day. Premature menopause treated with estro￾gens for more than 20 years. She was admitted to another
hospital the previous month with right hydrothorax. She
was diagnosed with hepatic hydrothorax with a liver
biopsy that revealed early micromacronodular cirrhosis,
with moderate activity and focal steatosis. Viral, meta￾bolic and autoimmune test were negative for the aetiolo￾gy of liver disease. Cardiopulmonary disease, as well as
infectious disease, tuberculosis and pleural or lung cancer
were excluded as the cause of the pleural effusion. Due to
the absence of response to fluid and sodium restriction
and diuretics she was submitted to thoracentesis and
chest tube insertion to alleviate symptoms. 
She was admitted to our hospital one month later with
recurrent right hydrothorax. Physical examination
showed decreased breath sounds over the right inferior
hemithorax. Blood cell count revealed leukocytosis of
20.500/µL with 77% of neutrophils. Other laboratory val￾ues were as follows: creatinine level 1.9 mg/dl, sodium
129 mEq/liter, potasium 5.4 mEq/liter, total protein 5.68

pleural fluid analysis met exudative criteria (total protein

albumin 1.82 mg/Dl, leukocytes 648 cel/mm3 with 50%
of neutrophils) with positive culture for coagulase-posi￾tive Staphylococcus aureus sensitive to oxacilin. Tuber￾culosis was excluded by the determination of alcohol￾acid resistant bacilli and gamma-interferon in pleural
fluid and negative mantoux. Moreover, malignancy was
ruled out by cytologic examination of pleural fluid and
pleural biopsy. Doppler ultrasound revealed signs of
chronic liver disease without morphologic nor hemody￾namic signs of portal hypertension, mild ascites and right
pleural effusion. On the basis of absence of response to
fluid and sodium restriction and diuretics, a chest tube
was placed to relieve symptoms, with drainage of 2000-
2500 cc of fluid per day. Pleural effusion was complicat￾ed by acute prerenal failure due to excessive fluid loss
and hypoproteinemia with hypoalbuminemia. In an at￾tempt to control pleural fluid formation, a minithoracoto￾my with talc pleurodesis was performed without success.
After pleurodesis failure, and with hemodynamic evi￾dence of mild portal hypertension (hepatic venous pres￾sure gradient: 13 mmHg) which suggested liver disease
as the cause of hydrothorax, TIPS placement was consid￾ered. There was a transient (2-3 days) decrease in chest
drainage volume. TIPS dysfunction was ruled out by
doppler ultrasound. Due to the severity of the disease and
the absence of other therapeutical options, treatment with
intravenous octreotide was started fifteen days later, at a
dose of 25 µg/h on the first day, 50 µg/h on the second
day and then 100 µg/h for five more days. The patient
had a good response to treatment with progressive de￾crease in chest tube drainage, allowing chest tube re￾moval without recurrence of pleural effusion. Before dis￾charge, a single dose of 10 mg subcutaneous octreotide
was administered. No recurrence of hydrothorax or as￾cites has occurred within six months of discharge with a
25 mg dose of aldactone daily. 
DISCUSSION
Hepatic hydrothorax is a rare complication of cirrho￾sis that is defined as accumulation of ascitic fluid in the
pleural space (> 500 ml), in a patient with liver cirrhosis
and portal hypertension, in the absence of cardiopul￾monary disease. The estimated prevalence of this compli￾cation in patients with liver cirrhosis is 5-10% (1,2,14).
Its pathophysiology is unclear and it involves movement
of ascitic fluid from the peritoneal cavity to the pleural
space through micro- or macroscopic diaphragmatic de￾fects (15-18). Pleural effusion is usually a transudate. In
our case, the presence of pleural exudate with positive
culture for coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus
was interpreted as empyema secondary to previous pro￾cedures. Findings allowed the exclusion of tumoral and
infectious diseases and the presence of signs of portal hy￾pertension led to the diagnosis of cirrhosis as the cause of
hydrothorax.
The management of this complication is usually diffi￾cult, with few therapeutical options. The aim of the
treatment is to decrease ascites formation and/or portal
hypertension. The only definitive treatment is liver
transplantation (19,20), and it must be always consid￾ered in these patients. Initial treatment is similar to that
of ascites and consists of fluid and sodium restriction
and diuretics (16,20). Refractory hepatic hydrothorax is
defined as pleural effusion that persists despite adequate
treatment with the highest tolerable dose of diuretics.
These are the most severely ill and difficult patients.
Management is dependent on respiratory symptoms
caused by hydrothorax (16) and consist of several thera￾peutic approaches: repeated thoracenteses, chest tube in￾sertion, pleurodesis and TIPS.
Patients with severe dysnea often require chest tube
placement, which is also used to treat iatrogenic or spon￾taneous infection of pleural effusion. This procedure has
many complications such as excessive protein, fluid and
electrolyte depletion. Chest tube removal is often impos￾sible due to high volume drainage. This has led many au￾thors to contraindicate chest tube placement in these pa￾tients (16).
There are some reported cases of successful treatment
with pleurodesis. Talc is administered during thora￾coscopy, performed to repair diaphragmatic defects if de￾tected. However, this treatment has a high morbimortality
rate as it is an invasive technique and it is usually per￾formed in severely debilitated patients (16,21). We con￾sidered this option for our patient due to the absence of
response to previous treatments and with the objective of
pleurodesis and detection of diaphragmatic defects, as
well as to perform a close examination of the thoracic
cavity, taking biopsy samples to definitely exclude malig￾nancy. The procedure was unsuccessful maintaining high
chest tube drainage that did not allow chest tube removal. 
According to literature, TIPS is the most effective
treatment for refractory hepatic hydrothorax and it is
considered one of the indications for this technique
(9,15,16). Apart from reducing hepatic venous pressure
gradient, it improves renal function (20). It has also been
reported to facilitate chest tube removal (15,18). Al￾though it is a safe, little-invasive and efficient procedure,
it has two major inconveniences: frequent obstruction of
the prosthesis and development of hepatic encephalopa￾thy (9). To prevent adverse outcomes after TIPS place￾ment, patients should be carefully selected, avoiding

those with hepatic encephalopathy or with Child C cir￾rhosis (16). After pleurodesis failure and once excluded
etiologies for hydrothorax other than liver disease, our
patient underwent a hemodynamic study. Based on he￾modynamic evidence of mild portal hypertension, TIPS
was performed. There was an initial response after the
procedure, with a decrease in chest drainage volume, that
did not allow chest tube removal. This response was tran￾sient as drainage volume subsequently increased despite
normal function of the prosthesis, as assesses by doppler
ultrasound. Besides, she developed hepatic encephalopa￾thy that responded to conventional treatment. There are
two reported cases of treatment of refractory hepatic hy￾drothorax with octreotide in patients without other inva￾sive options because of poor condition. Treatment with
octreotide was justified as it has the same effect as TIPS
in reducing portosystemic pressure gradient. This drug
has few and minor side effects (15,20). Based on good re￾sponse to octreotide treatment in these cases we consid￾ered this treatment for our patient. We administered the
same doses as those reported in the literature: 25 µg/h
on the first day, 50 µg/h on the second day and then
100 µg/h for five more days. In the reported cases, the
effect was dose dependent since higher doses led to
greater reduction of drainage volume. Our patient had
progressive improvement, allowing chest tube removal
after five days of treatment (Fig. 1). We decided to con￾tinue treatment for several days by subcutaneous admin￾istration before discharge. Hydrothorax has not recurred
within six months of discharge.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the third reported
case of refractory hepatic hydrothorax with response to oc￾treotide. Contrary to the two previous case reports (15,20),
our patient had failed to all available treatment options, in￾cluding pleurodesis and TIPS. It is possible that TIPS and
octreotide had a summatory effect on the decrease of portal
hypertension. Based on this favorable response to oc￾treotide, we think that splanchnic vasoconstrictors should
be considered in the treatment of serious complications
such as refractory hepatic hydrothorax and ascites.
