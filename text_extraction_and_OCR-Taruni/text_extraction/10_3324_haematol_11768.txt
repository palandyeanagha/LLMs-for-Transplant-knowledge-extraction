Brief Report
ABSTRACT
We studied the utility of pancreatic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 72 thalassemia major patients (21 diabetic, 51 normo￾glycemic). Diabetic patients were significantly older (p<0.0001) and had smaller pancreas volume (p<0.0001). The two groups were
comparable for ferritin and MRI-T2* heart, liver and pancreas. Pancreatic T2* signals were abnormal in 80% of both groups, and cor￾related with heart T2*. In normoglycemic patients, cardiac T2* and log-pancreatic T2* values correlated with homeostatic model
assessments HOMA-B (b cell reserve), HOMA-IR (insulin resistance) and fasting insulin/C-peptide levels. This suggested that improved
chelation may improve b cell reserve and prevent pancreatic atrophy.

Introduction
Thalassemia major patients require life-long transfusion chela￾tion to avoid premature death due to organ damage by hemo￾siderosis. The leading cause of death is cardiac failure, but many
patients also suffer from endocrine damage such as pituitary fail￾ure, hypogonadism, diabetes mellitus, and hypothyroid and
hypoparathyroidism. 
Even aggressive deferoxamine chelation, does not provide
complete cardiac and endocrine protection. The availability of
new oral iron chelating agents1, 2 and cardiac T2* magnetic reso￾nance imaging (MRI) has revolutionized thalassemia manage￾ment.3 There are still few reports, however, on the use of MRI to
study iron deposits in the endocrine organs. Pancreatic hemo￾siderosis can cause insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. 
This can be rapid in onset and is largely irreversible. The inci￾dence of impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes in thalassemia
major patients varied from 9% to 15%, depending on the age of
assessment, the intensity of chelation and transfusion and related
patient compliance.4,5 It is uncertain whether early assessment
and tailored chelation can prevent diabetes and preserve pancre￾atic reserve. The current study explores the utility of pancreatic
MRI in thalassemia major cases. 
Design and Methods
All MRI examinations were performed with a 1.5T scanner
(Sonata, Siemens Medical, Erlanger, Germany). T2* myocardium
was assessed by a cardiac gated single breath hold 8-echo
sequence (field of view: 400 mm, slice thickness 10 mm; time of
repetition: 160 ms; Time to echo: 2.6 ms, 4.6 ms, 6.6 ms, 8.7 ms,
10.7 ms, 12.7 ms, 14.7 ms and 16.7 ms; resolution: 256 x 256, flip
angle: 20; number of average: 1).6 Cardiac gated breath hold cine
true FISP sequence was performed and ejection fraction (EF) was
analyzed using Argus software (Siemens Medical Systems,
Erlangen, Germany). Analysis of the T2* values and T2 value of
the myocardium were performed with a dedicated software
(CMRtools; Cardiovascular Imaging Solutions, London, UK). A
true FISP breath hold sequence (field of view: 350 mm,
TR/TE=280.5/1.22 ms, flip angle: 650
; number of excitation+1,
slice thickness of 6 mm with gap of 1.5 mm) was used to cover
the whole abdomen, including the liver and pancreas. Analysis
was performed on raw values and after logarithmic transforma￾tion of T2* values of liver and pancreas. The area of the pancreas
was outlined by electronic caliper and the volume was calculated
by multiplying the total area by 7.5mm. The normal MRI T2*
values of pancreas were determined from 20 local age and sex

matched controls. For patients not on exogenous insulin,
fasting glucose, C-peptide and insulin levels were assessed,
and homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) indices for b￾cell function (HOMA-B: Insulin x 20/Glucose - 3.5, normal
130-400) and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR: Insulin x
Glucose/22.5, normal 0.8-1.6) were calculated. Statistical
analysis was performed using SPSS 13.0 (Chicago, IL, USA)
Results and Discussion
A total of 72 thalassemia major patients (median age: 27,
range 12-47, 31 males and 41 females) were recruited.
Their clinical details have been previously reported and are
representative of the local cohort.5,7 The median ferritin
level was 6,259 pmol/L (range 605-14,380). Subcutaneous
deferoxamine was used for life-long chelation in all cases,
but compliance was poor, with only 22% of cases main￾taining ferritin below 3,000 pmol/L. Short-term (3-6
months) free trial of deferiprone (n=18) and deferasirox
(n=16) was used in some cases. The mean number of units
of red cell transfused per month was 3.3 (range 2-5) and the
incidence of heart failure (EF<55%) and hypogonadism on
hormonal replacement were 20% and 62% respectively. A
total of 21 patients (29%) were already on insulin replace￾ment. Patients with diabetes were significantly older (32 vs.
24.4 years old, p<0.0001) and had lower pancreatic vol￾umes (p<0.0001, Table 1, online supplement) than patients
without diabetes. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
analysis showed < 3,705 mm3
was predictive of diabetes in
the cohort (p=0.0001) with a sensitivity of 80% (95% con￾fidence interval (CI): 52-95%) and a specificity of 92%
(95% CI: 78-98%). The median pancreas T2* was 12.2 ms
(range 1.3-61.9), significantly lower than 20 normal con￾trols (median 37.5 ms, range 21.3-53 ms, p<0.0001). The
incidence of abnormal T2* (taken as <21 ms) was 81%
among both diabetic and non-diabetic cases (p=0.9,
Wilcoxon test). The two groups were also comparable for
T2* of the heart (p=0.24) and liver (p=0.11), median ferritin
level (p=0.16) and median monthly volume transfused red
cells (p=0.22). The pancreatic T2* values increase with age
(r=0.27, p=0.028) and showed correlation with cardiac T2*
(p=0.008) and EF (p=0.024), but only a trend with liver T2*
(p=0.09). It did not relate to pancreatic volume (p=0.29) or
ferritin levels (p=0.45). The correlations were stronger after
logarithmic transformation of pancreatic T2* (Table 1) and
applied in both diabetic and non-diabetic cases. Bio￾chemical tests for sub-clinical pancreatic insufficiency were
further analyzed in 51 patients not on exogenous insulin
supplement. Although the fasting glucose, insulin and C￾peptide levels were mostly within normal range, abnormal
HOMA-B and HOMA-IR was found in 90% and 33% of
patients. The reduction in pancreatic b cell reserve
(HOMA-B) was predicted by abnormal T2* in the pan￾creas, liver (after log transformation) and especially abnor￾mal T2* of the heart, but not by pancreatic volume (Table
2, online supplement). The T2* of heart and log T2* of pan￾creas also showed significant correlation with reduced fast￾ing insulin and C-peptides, as well as insulin resistance, as
reflected by HOMA-IR. None of the biochemical measure￾ments showed significant correlation with age. On multi￾variate analysis, only T2* of the heart (but not log-liver T2*
or log-pancreas T2*) showed significant correlation with
HOMA-B (p<0.001) and HOMA-IR (p=0.009). It is known
that pancreatic hemosiderosis results in abnormal MRI sig￾nal intensity, and there is iron overload in the pancreas in
up to 75-100% of thalassemia major cases.7-9 The signal
intensity ratio results showed correlation with ferritin lev￾els9 and also related to iron load in other organs.7 They also
correlated with exocrine pancreatic secretion function9 and
endocrine function as assessed by oral glucose tolerance
test (OGTT).8 Pancreatic abnormalities in thalassemia
major patients can also be defined by other imaging modal￾ities such as ultrasound echogenicity.10 However, MRI has
become an integral part of iron assessment in thalassemia,
so new pancreatic MRI studies using other signal algo￾rithms are urgently needed. In the current study, the single
breath T2* assessment was also preferred for its short scan￾ning time. Similarly, a fasting blood sample was chosen
over OGTT (or the gold standard of euglycemic clamp)11
due to patient preference. Both insulin secretion capacity
(HOMA-B) and insulin sensitivity (HOMA-IR) are known
to be impaired in thalassemia major, even in apparently
normoglycemic cases.12 It is important, therefore, to corre￾late these pre-diabetic biochemical abnormalities with MRI
studies. Our results showed that hemosiderosis of the pan￾creas, as measured by MRI T2*, could not be predicted by
age or ferritin levels. This matches the low predictive value
of most forms of ferritin measurements.13 We also con￾firmed that pancreatic hemosiderosis did not correlate with
liver hemosiderosis.8 However, there was strong correla￾tion between hemosiderosis of the pancreas and heart.
This may be due to the same L-type calcium iron channels
in the two organs.14 This is of clinical importance. Firstly,
chelation regimens that fail to prevent cardiac siderosis
may also fail in the pancreas, and vice versa. Secondly,
without pancreatic MRI, cardiac MRI T2* becomes a surro￾gate assessment for pancreatic hemosiderosis. This is par￾ticularly relevant since we showed that cardiac T2* corre￾lated strongly with sub-clinical pancreatic impairment and
insulin resistance, in fact, even more so than pancreatic
T2*. Thirdly, in areas where even cardiac T2* is unavail￾able, biochemical measurements of HOMA-B may be used
for surrogate assessment of cardiac risk. Our study showed
that pancreatic atrophy (volume) was a better predictor of
diabetic status than pancreatic hemosiderosis (T2*). In
other studies, MRI documented pancreatic fatty replace￾ment has also been shown to predict diabetes8 Pancreatic
damage represents an irreversible, cumulative destruction
of b cells15 and pancreatic atrophy is a common finding in
all diabetes patients irrespective of etiology.16 Unlike the
heart or liver, the pancreas may not regenerate or remodel
even with reduction in hemosiderosis. Furthermore, there
are other causative factors for diabetes such as genetic pre-

disposition and immune damage which are unlikely to be
reflected by MRI T2* results.17 Thus, established diabetic
thalassemic patients seldom recover normal glucose toler￾ance.18 On the other hand, in normoglycemic patients, pan￾creatic hemosiderosis may affect b cell reserve and insulin
resistance. The latter was notably unrelated to liver hemo￾siderosis, and it is unclear whether insulin resistance in tha￾lassemics is related to iron in the fat or skeletal muscles.
Irrespective of the mechanism, these parameters are known
to improve with intense chelation, especially in patients
with impaired glucose tolerance.19 It is likely, therefore, that
advancement in iron assessment and chelation will not only
reduce cardiac morbidity but will impact on future diabetic

risks. Study limitations included the lack of biopsy data to
verify the pancreatic MRI T* signal, and the over-represen￾tation of poorly chelated patients. It is also possible that, as
in MRI assessment of liver iron load, other algorithms and
reading transformation may yield better correlations.20
Hopefully, these questions will be addressed by future
studies.
