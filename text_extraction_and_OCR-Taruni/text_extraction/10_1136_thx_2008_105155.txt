Abstract
Background: The epidemiology of respiratory viruses and their
potential clinical impact when recovered in lower respiratory
specimens has not been established in the hospital setting. A study
was performed to investigate the association between positive viral
detection and respiratory infection in an at-risk population.
Methods: 299 adult patients who underwent bronchoalveolar
lavage (BAL) procedures were enrolled in a hospital-based
prospective cohort study. Descriptive epidemiology is presented of
17 different respiratory viruses detected by reverse transcription-
polymerase chain reaction assays in BAL fluid specimens.
Multivariate analysis was conducted to identify the clinical
characteristics independently associated with the presence of virus.


Results: Of 522 BAL fluid specimens analysed, 81% were collected
in adult transplant recipients or other immunocompromised
patients. Overall, PCR assays identified viral nucleic acid in 91 BAL
fluid samples (17.4%). Similar rates of virus-positive BAL fluid were
found in the different subpopulations studied (p = 0.113).
Coronaviruses were the most frequent (32.3%), followed by
rhinovirus (22.6%), parainfluenza (19.5%), influenza (9.7%),
respiratory synctial virus (8.6%), human metapneumovirus (4.2%)
and bocavirus (3.1%). Multivariate analysis using mixed models
showed that respiratory viral infections were associated with a lack
of antibiotic treatment response (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.2 to 4.1) and the
absence of radiological infiltrate (OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.2 to 0.8). In
lung transplant recipients in whom a respiratory infection was
suspected, the respiratory viral detection rate was 24.4% compared
with 13.8% overall in other patients (p = 0.02).
Conclusions: In this cohort of hospitalised adults, respiratory
viruses detected in BAL fluid specimens were associated with
respiratory symptoms, absence of radiological infiltrates and a poor
response to antibiotic therapy.

JG participated in the development of the study design,
implemented the study, and was in charge of data
management and analysis and the writing and revision of the
manuscript. PMS assisted in the study design, supervised the
study in Geneva, collected data and participated in the
analysis and writing of the manuscript. J-DA assisted in the
study design, supervised the study in Lausanne, collected
data, participated in the analysis of the data and the writing
of the manuscript. TR participated in the study design, helped
to oversee the implementation, supported the recruitment of
the patients and assisted with manuscript preparation. PM
helped to process the samples and to implement the study in
Lausanne and assisted with manuscript preparation. YT was
in charge of the development of the molecular assays used,
supervised the laboratory analysis and assisted with
manuscript preparation. CT was in charge of the development
of the molecular assays used, supervised the laboratory
analysis and assisted with manuscript preparation. POB was
in charge of the data management, analysis and the statistical
methods, and participated actively in the writing and revision

study, designed the protocol, supervised the laboratory
analysis and was the recipient of the funding. He participated
in the data analysis, wrote the manuscript and revised article
drafts for publication. LK takes responsibility for the integrity
of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis. All authors
