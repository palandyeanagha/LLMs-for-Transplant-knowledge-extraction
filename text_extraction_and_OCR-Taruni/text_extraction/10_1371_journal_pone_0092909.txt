Abstract
Background: Clenbuterol (Cl), a b2 agonist, is associated with enhanced myocardial recovery during left ventricular assist
device (LVAD) support, and exerts beneficial remodelling effects during mechanical unloading (MU) in rodent heart failure
(HF). However, the specific effects of combined Cl+b1 blockade during MU are unknown.
Methods and Results: We studied the chronic effects (4 weeks) of b2-adrenoceptor (AR) stimulation via Cl (2 mg/kg/day)
alone, and in combination with b1-AR blockade using metoprolol ((Met), 250 mg/kg/day), on whole heart/cell structure,
function and excitation-contraction (EC) coupling in failing (induced by left coronary artery (LCA) ligation), and unloaded
(induced by heterotopic abdominal heart transplantation (HATx)) failing rat hearts. Combined Cl+Met therapy displayed
favourable effects in HF: Met enhanced Cl’s improvement in ejection fraction (EF) whilst preventing Cl-induced hypertrophy
and tachycardia. During MU combined therapy was less beneficial than either mono-therapy. Met, not Cl, prevented MU￾induced myocardial atrophy, with increased atrophy occurring during combined therapy. MU-induced recovery of Ca2+
transient amplitude, speed of Ca2+ release and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ content was enhanced equally by Cl or Met
mono-therapy, but these benefits, together with Cl’s enhancement of sarcomeric contraction speed, and MU-induced
recovery of Ca2+ spark frequency, disappeared during combined therapy.
Conclusions: Combined Cl+Met therapy shows superior functional effects to mono-therapy in rodent HF, but appears
inferior to either mono-therapy in enhancing MU-induced recovery of EC coupling. These results suggest that combined b2-
AR simulation +b1-AR blockade therapy is likely to be a safe and beneficial therapeutic HF strategy, but is not as effective as
mono-therapy in enhancing myocardial recovery during LVAD support.

Introduction
The use of LVADs in end stage HF continues to expand [1].
LVADs are used primarily as ‘‘bridge to transplantation’’. In a
minority of patients they have been used as a ‘‘bridge to recovery’’
(BTR), where sufficient functional recovery of the failing heart is
achieved, allowing device removal. However, explantation rates
remain universally low (#10%) [2,3].
HF-associated remodelling is a complex series of whole heart,
cellular, molecular, structural and functional changes affecting
various pathways, including EC coupling, the extracellular matrix
(ECM), apoptosis and adrenergic receptor signalling [4]. Previ￾ously thought to be uni-directional, such adverse remodelling is
now considered reversible, a process termed reverse remodelling.
Pharmacological intervention induces mild reversal of HF
remodelling, demonstrating functional and prognostic benefit [5–
7], however, a more substantial degree of reverse remodelling is
achieved via LVAD [8]. Despite profound LVAD-induced reverse
remodelling, functional myocardial recovery is rare. This disparity
is proposed to arise due to negative MU-induced changes
occurring during prolonged unloading [9,10]. Indeed, in animals
and humans, initial contractile recovery of failing hearts is seen to
subsequently worsen during prolonged MU [3,11]. Time depen￾dent worsening of EC coupling [12], Ca2+ handling [11] and
myocardial atrophy [13] are proposed negative drivers of
contractile performance.
‘‘Combination therapy’’ describes a strategy in which pharma￾cotherapy is combined with LVAD support, to enhance LVAD–
induced positive remodelling and/or combat LVAD-induced
‘‘negative’’ remodelling [10]. In our institute this strategy - the
‘‘Harefield Protocol’’ - successfully enhanced rates of functional
recovery (.63%) in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy [14,15].
In this unique protocol, the b2-adrenoceptor (AR) agonist Cl was
employed alongside conventional HF pharmacotherapy, primarily
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 September 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 9 | e92909

as an agent to prevent myocardial atrophy. Cl’s ability to induce
physiological cardiac hypertrophy [16] mandated its inclusion in
this protocol, but whether anti-atrophic properties contributed to
enhancing functional recovery is unclear [17]. Hence, Cl’s precise
role in enhancing functional recovery remains poorly defined and
controversial. Beyond hypertrophic effects, Cl demonstrates other
wide-ranging favourable whole heart/cellular functional, structur￾al, metabolic, cell-survival, EC coupling and gene expression
effects in non-failing [16,18], failing [19,20] and unloaded [19,21]
hearts.
BTR remains controversial, but the clinical success of combi￾nation therapy (14, 15) justifies continued scrutiny of this strategy.
Therefore, the search for other novel pharmacological strategies
aimed at enhancing LVAD-induced functional recovery continues,
and we have recently shown the pacemaker current inhibitor
ivabradine and Met to show positive effects on myocardial size,
EC coupling and the ECM during mechanical unloading in rodent
HF [22].
The efficacy of b-AR blockade in HF therapy is established
[4,6,23] and is predominantly secondary to blockade of detrimen￾tal b1-AR signalling [4]. Greater understanding of the roles played
by b1-/b2-AR signalling indicates distinct and often opposing
physiological and pathological actions on cardiac structure and
function [24], with chronic b1-AR signalling associated with pro￾apoptotic and maladaptive remodelling [25] and chronic b2-AR
signalling with cardio-protective actions, improved function and
myocyte viability [26,27]. Supporting this, combined b1-AR
blockade (Met) and b2-AR stimulation (fenoterol) has shown
synergistic beneficial remodelling effects in rodent HF [24],
although lack of synergy (Cl+Met) has also been demonstrated
[20]. These studies instituted pharmacotherapy early after LCA
ligation (,3 weeks) and combined drug effects in an established
rodent HF model remain unknown. b2-AR stimulation (Cl)
demonstrates positive effects during MU in rodent studies
[19,28], however, the specific effects of combined b2-AR
stimulation and b1-AR blockade remain unstudied within this
setting.
In this study, we report for the first time the chronic effects of
combined b2-AR stimulation (Cl) and b1-AR blockade (Met) on
reverse remodelling during MU in a rodent HF model. In
particular, we have examined the drug effects on whole heart/cell
size, function, EC coupling and T-tubule structure in a rat model
of established HF, 12 weeks post LCA ligation, and during MU
using HATx.
Methods
Ethics Statement
The investigation conformed to the Guide for the care and Use
of Laboratory Animals published by the US National Institutes of
Health (NIH publication No 85–23, revised 1996). Experiments
were approved by the Harefield Heart Science Centre ethics
review panel.
(For extended methods please refer to Methods S1).
Animal models
Induction of heart failure. HF was induced via permanent
LCA ligation as previously described [11,19–22,24]. Animals were
anaesthetised with isoflurane (5% induction, 1.5% maintenance)
mixed with O2 (2–3 L/min), intubated and mechanically venti￾lated via rodent ventilator, and a left thoracotomy performed. The
pericardium was opened and heart visualised, the proximal LCA
was identified and a suture (6–0 prolene) placed underneath the
artery and lightly tied. Heamostasis was achieved and the chest
closed. Sham operated animals underwent the identical protocol
but the suture was not tied. Acute 24 hour mortality was 25% in
the LCA ligation group and 0% in the sham group. Male
syngeneic Lewis rats (10 weeks old ,200 g, Harlan, UK) were
used for all experiments to avoid the need for immunosuppression
following subsequent heterotopic abdominal transplant (HATx) in
the mechanical unloading (MU) groups. 1 week after surgery LV
dimensions and function (ejection fraction (EF)) were assessed by
transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) (Acuson SequoiaTM 256;
Acuson, USA), as previously described [18–21,24]. LAD ligation
animals with an EF less than 40% were included in the study, as in
our experience animals with baseline function greater than this
were unlikely to develop severe dysfunction 12 weeks following
surgery. 12 weeks following LCA ligation the presence of severe
cardiac dysfunction was confirmed via repeat TTE, and animals
were randomised to groups (n = 8). All groups had similar average
EF and variability. 3 month mortality was 1% following LCA
ligation and 0% in sham group. TTE was performed under
general anaesthesia with isoflurane 1%, mixed with O2 (2–3 L/
min) to provide adequate sedation but minimal cardiac depression.
Experiments were not performed in non-failing hearts as these
show an exaggerated atrophic response during unloading com￾pared with failing hearts [29].
In order to test the effects of pharmacotherapy (Cl and/or Met)
in combination with MU, failing hearts (12 weeks after LCA
ligation) were transplanted into the abdomen of syngeneic male
Lewis rats (weight ,250 g) as previously described [11–13,19], for
a period of 4 weeks. In brief, both animals (recipient and donor)
were anaesthetised with isoflurane (5% induction, 1% mainte￾nance) mixed with O2 (2–3 L/min), and self-ventilated throughout
the procedure. The failing heart was removed from the donor
animal under cardioplegic arrest, and the donor aorta anasto￾mosed to the recipient abdominal aorta and the donor pulmonary
artery to the recipient inferior vena cava. Total ischaemic time was
,40 minutes and operative mortality ,4%, with no deaths
occurring in any of the treatment groups during the 4 week
treatment period.
Recipients were then assigned to 4 treatment groups: (1) Cl
(Sigma, England) 2 mg/kg/day via subcutaneous infusion using
osmotic minipump (Model 2002, Alzet), (2) Met (Sigma, England)
250 mg/kg/day in drinking water, (3) Met 250 mg/kg/day +Cl
2 mg/kg/day via drinking water and osmotic minipump respec￾tively, (4) no drug treatment (MUHF+Cl, MUHF+Met, MUHF+
MetCl and MUHF, respectively). Animals in Met-treated and
MUHF group also received an osmotic minipump containing
normal saline. All groups contained 8 animals and treatment
duration was 4 weeks. At end of treatment Cl levels in blood were
measured as previously described [18], with no difference between
the different groups treated (in mM: HF+Cl = 0.17+/20.01, n = 8;
MUHF+Cl = 0.17+/20.01, n = 8; HF+MetCl = 0.16+/20.01;
n = 8; MUHF+MetCl = 0.16+/20.02, n = 8; p = 0.93).
In order to test the effects of Cl and Met in non-transplanted
failing hearts, HF animals were randomly allocated to 4 treatment
groups: (1) Cl 2 mg/kg/day, (2) Met 250 mg/kg/day, (3)
combined Met+Cl treatment, (4) no drug treatment (HF+Cl,
HF+Met, HF+MetCl and HF, respectively). Drug administration
was via drinking water and osmotic minipump, exactly as
described above. At the end of the treatment period in vivo heart
function was measured via repeat TTE.
We have compared the effects of Met during mechanical
unloading with those of ivabradine in a previously published study
[22]. Therefore, we have included this data here for comparison
with the effects of Cl and combined MetCl therapy. The data
acquired from the Met group are contemporary and obtained in

otherwise identical conditions to the data for the Cl and MetCl
groups.
In-vivo assessment of heart rate. 4 animals per treatment
group received implantable ECG telemetry transmitters (CA-F40
Data Sciences International, Minneapolis, MN) on day 0 of the 4
week treatment period, for in vivo HR and arrhythmia studies.
Animals underwent continuous 24 hour ECG recording at weekly
intervals during the treatment period. In vivo ECG recordings
were acquired using Dataquest ART 3.1 software (Data Sciences
International, Minneapolis, MN), and offline HR/arrhythmia
analysis performed using ECG-Auto 2.4 software (EMKA,
France).
Animal anaesthesia, analgesia and
euthanasia. Adequacy of anaesthesia during all procedures
was monitored by loss of reflexes, degree of muscle relaxation and
respiration rate. Respiration rate and body temperature were
monitored throughout all procedures and body temperature
maintained at 37uC, via heating mat. Analgesia was provided by
subcutaneous (SC) injection of vetergesic (buprenorphine), just
prior to skin incision. For LCA ligation and implantation of
telemetry device a single dose of 0.03 mg/kg was utilised, and for
heterotopic abdominal heart transplant both the donor and
recipient received a single dose of 0.05 mg/kg. Post-operative
condition of the rats was monitored, and repeat SC injection
administered as required (0.01–0.05 mg/kg) every 12 hours
during the first week post-operative week. At the end of the 4
week treatment period animals were sacrificed via schedule 1
cervical dislocation. In each group, 4 hearts were utilised for acute
cellular experiments, and 4 for histological analysis.
Cardiomyocyte studies
LV cardiomyocytes were isolated by standard enzymatic
digestion for 8–10 minutes using collagenase (1 mg/ml, Worthing￾ton, USA) and hyaluronidase (0.6 mg/ml, Sigma, England) [19]
and used within 6 h.
Assessment of sarcomere shortening and calcium
handling. Simultaneous assessment of sarcomere shortening
and Ca2+ handling in field stimulated cardiomyocytes was
performed using an inverted microscope (TE 200), Ionoptix
system (Ionoptix Corporation, USA) and the Ca2+ sensitive, single￾excitation dual emission fluorescent dye Indo-1 AM (Molecular
Probes, USA). In addition, sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+
uptake (SERCA) and sodium-calcium exchanger (NCX) contri￾bution to Ca2+ extrusion were assessed using rapid caffeine
application as previously described [19].
Assessment of electrophysiological parameters. Cells
were studied using a MultiClamp 700A (Axon Instruments) in
whole cell patch configuration. Current-voltage relationships for
L-type Ca2+ current were studied and normalized to cell
capacitance, as previously described [19].
Assessment of cell volume, t tubules and calcium sparks
with confocal microscopy. Cell volume and t-tubule organi￾sation were studied using the membrane binding dye di-8-Anepps
(Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA) and the Zeiss Axiovert
microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) with an LSM 510
confocal attachment. In addition, local changes in Ca2+ levels were
assessed using the fluorescent dye Fluo-4 AM (Molecular Probes,
USA) and the same confocal microscope as previously described
[29].
Statistical analysis
Statistical comparison of data was performed using one-way
analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni post-hoc test for
individual significant differences, or Student’s t-test where
appropriate. All statistical analyses were performed using Prism
4 software (Graph-Pad Software, Inc.) and P,0.05 was considered
significant. Data are expressed as mean 6SEM [n], where n is the
number of cells unless otherwise specified. All of the experiments
were performed using a minimum of four animals, unless
otherwise stated.
Results
Heart rate
There was no difference in average HR between sham-operated
and HF group at any time point (mean HR (bpm) at 4 weeks:
sham 33264.8 vs. HF 32965.5; P.0.05). HR of transplanted
failing hearts (MUHF) was significantly lower (,20%) than that of
non-transplanted failing hearts at all time-points (Figure 1A). Cl
caused a consistent increase in HR (,12%) at all time-points
during MU, with Met either alone, or in combination with Cl
reducing HR by approximately 15% (Figure 1A). Assessment of
HR of non-transplanted failing hearts revealed similar drug effects:
Cl caused a significant increase in HR (,10%) compared to HF
group during first 3 weeks of therapy, but this effect was not
present at week 4. Met caused significant and equivalent HR
reduction (,20%) either alone, or in combination with Cl,
compared to HF group at all-time points (Figure 1B).
LV function
LCA ligation induced LV dysfunction after 12 weeks (time of
randomisation), characterised by reduced LVEF (%): sham
83.360.8 vs. HF 37.660.7; reduced LVFS (%): sham 48.360.7
vs. HF 16.660.5; and LV chamber dilatation (diastolic diameter
(cm)): sham 0.6060.03 vs. HF 0.9860.04, P,0.001 for all
parameters.
No difference in these parameters was detected between
treatment groups prior to commencing therapy (Figure 2A and
B). In-vivo function of transplanted failing hearts was not assessed,
but that of non-transplanted hearts was assessed via repeat TTE at
the end of the 4 week treatment period. Cl improved contractile
function of non-transplanted failing hearts, and improvement in
LVEF was enhanced further by combination with Met (Fig￾ure 2A and B). Met-induced increase in EF and FS was not
statistically significant.
Cardiac and cardiomyocyte size
LCA ligation induced cardiac and cellular hypertrophy, shown
by increased total HW, HW:BW ratio and cardiomyocyte
volumes, compared to sham-operated group (Table 1). MU of
failing hearts induced myocardial atrophy at whole heart and
cardiomyocyte level, with both HW and cardiomyocyte volumes
falling below those of sham values (Figure 3A and B). HW of
MUHF group was ,40% smaller than that of HF group and
,17% smaller than sham, with cell volume being ,55% lower
than in HF group and ,26% smaller than sham volumes. Cl had
no effect on myocardial atrophy. Met prevented both whole heart
and cellular atrophy, restoring mean HW and cardiomyocyte
volumes to sham values, whilst combined MetCl therapy worsened
MU-induced atrophy (Figure 3A and B).
In non-transplanted failing hearts Cl augmented cardiac
hypertrophy, an effect that disappeared during combined MetCl
therapy (Figure 3C). At a cellular level Met induced partial
regression of cellular hypertrophy, but this effect was also lost
during combined MetCl therapy (Figure 3D).

Cardiomyocyte EC coupling
MU-induced recovery of deranged EC coupling. LCA
ligation caused impaired cardiomyocyte contractility and de￾ranged Ca2+ cycling: speed of sarcomeric contraction, relaxation
and Ca2+ release, along with Ca2+ transient amplitude were all
decreased, sarcomeric contraction amplitude remaining un￾changed (Figure 4 A–E). MU normalised speed of sarcomeric
contraction and this effect was further enhanced by Cl, with Met
and MetCl therapy having no added effect (Figure 4B). MU
partially improved speed of relaxation, and this effect was
antagonised by Met, with no additional observed changes
following Cl and MetCl treatment (Figure 4C). In addition,
MU recovered Ca2+ transient amplitude, speed of Ca2+ release
and SR Ca2+ content, and this recovery was further enhanced by
both Cl and Met mono-therapy equally, but not by combined
MetCl treatment (Figure 4 D–F).
An increased SR Ca2+ leak, secondary to altered RyR function,
is one mechanism contributing to reduced SR Ca2+ load in HF
[30]. Ca2+ sparks are complex entities regulated by multiple
factors, and represent a measure of diastolic SR Ca2+ release [29].
Ca2+ spark frequency was increased in HF group compared to
sham group suggesting increased SR Ca2+ leak ((sparks/100 mm/
sec): sham 0.8060.17 [37] vs. HF 3.0060.34 [40]; P,0.001). MU
normalised HF-induced increase in Ca2+ spark frequency (sparks/
100 mm/sec): MUHF 0.8260.13 [36] vs. HF 3.0060.48 [40]; P,
0.001. This recovery was unaffected by either Cl or Met mono￾Figure 1. Average HR of mechanically unloaded failing hearts (MUHF) (A) and non-transplanted failing hearts (B) measured using

MUHF+MetCl [30] 3.5160.36; P,0.001 vs. MUHF and P.0.05
vs. HF. MU also caused recovery of HF-induced depression of L￾type Ca2+ current and t-tubule density (Figure 5). However, this
recovery was largely antagonised by all three drug treatments; with
only maintenance of L-type Ca2+ current recovery occurring in the
combined MetCl-treated group (Figure 5A and B).
Effects of Cl and Met on deranged EC coupling in non￾transplanted failing hearts. Met therapy, either alone or in
combination with Cl normalised speed of sarcomeric contraction,
relaxation and Ca2+ release, along with Ca2+ transient amplitude,
while Cl mono-therapy displayed no effect (Figure 6B–E). Met,
Cl and combined MetCl therapy all recovered SR Ca2+ content,

with the greatest improvement seen following Met therapy
(Figure 6F). Cl alone caused significant reduction in spark
frequency (HF+Cl 1.1060.17 [30]; P,0.01 vs. HF), whereas
spark frequency was no different to HF in the Met or MetCl￾treated groups (HF+Met 2.1060.22 [30] and HF+MetCl
2.0060.32 [32], both groups P.0.05 vs. HF). Drug therapies
had differing effects on L-type Ca2+ current and t-tubule density.
HF-induced depression of both these parameters was normalised
by Cl; Met therapy alone, or in combination with Cl showed no
effect (Figure 7).
Discussion
In the first part of this study we showed that Met but not Cl
prevented MU-induced myocardial atrophy, with combined
MetCl therapy worsening atrophic remodelling. MU induced
recovery of deranged EC coupling, with either Cl or Met mono￾therapy, but not combined MetCl therapy, broadly enhancing this
recovery. MU-induced recovery of Ca2+ transient amplitude,
speed of Ca2+ release and SR Ca2+ content was enhanced by Cl or
Met mono-therapy equally. However, these positive effects,
together with Cl’s enhancement of speed of sarcomeric contrac￾tion, were lost during combined MetCl therapy, along with MU￾induced recovery of Ca2+ spark frequency.
The second part of this study showed combined b2-AR
stimulation (Cl) and b1-AR blockade (Met) to improve depressed
whole heart function in HF, to a greater degree than either mono￾therapy. Cl’s improvement in LVEF was enhanced by Met, but
the mechanisms underlying this superiority appeared independent
of cellular EC coupling. Met and Cl mono-therapy displayed
distinct EC coupling effects. Met’s effects were more favourable
than those of Cl, with lack of evidence supporting additive or
synergistic benefit, and more suggestive of selected antagonism
during combined therapy. Met alone, and in combination with Cl
normalised speed of sarcomeric contraction, relaxation, Ca2+
release and Ca2+ transient amplitude, and enhanced SR Ca2+
content; whereas Cl mono-therapy improved SR Ca2+ content to a
lesser degree than Met, and normalised deranged Ca2+ spark
frequency, L-type Ca2+ current and t-tubule density, positive
effects that were lost during combined MetCl therapy. Of note,

unloading (MUHF), measured using Indo-1 and Ionoptix system. Cl’s enhancement of MU-induced recovery of speed of sarcomeric
contraction (B) and Met’s antagonism of MU-induced improvement in speed of relaxation (C) are shown. Cl and Met’s enhancement of MU-induced
recovery of Ca2+ transient amplitude (D), speed of Ca2+ release (E) and SR Ca2+ content (F), and lack of enhancement during combined MetCl therapy
is shown. *P,0.05, **P,0.01 and ***P,0.001. Representative traces of sarcomeric contractions (G) and Ca2+ transients (H) are shown.

undesirable Cl-induced hypertrophic/chronotropic effects were
prevented during combined therapy.
These results suggest that A) Cl’s success in enhancing
functional recovery in LVAD-supported patients is unrelated to
myocardial size, and reliant on positive EC coupling effects, B)
combined b2-AR stimulation +b1-AR blockade is likely to be a safe
and beneficial HF therapeutic pharmacological strategy and C)
either the strategy of b2-AR stimulation or b1-AR blockade is likely
to be superior to that of combined b2-AR stimulation +b1-AR
blockade in enhancing functional recovery during LVAD support.
This is, however, in contrast with the current clinical experience
with b1-AR blockade in patients with LVADs and could be
explained by the type and degree of adverse remodelling obtained
in our models. It cannot be excluded that subpopulations of
LVAD patients with specific, lower degrees of dysfunction may
benefit from this pharmacological treatment and more clinical
studies are warranted.
Combined b2-AR stimulation and b1-AR blockade during
mechanical unloading
Myocardial atrophy. LVAD-mediated unloading of failing
ventricles regresses cardiac and cellular hypertrophy [8]. Whether
such regression progresses during prolonged clinical LVAD
support towards myocardial ‘‘atrophy’’ i.e. decreased cardiac
and cell size to sub-normal values, remains controversial [31]. In
contrast, convincing experimental data derived mainly from
rodent studies employing HATx clearly demonstrate atrophy of
normal [13,28] and failing [11] hearts. It must be emphasised that
in this context atrophy relates to decreased size and not function.
A key question surrounding Cl is whether anti-atrophic
properties contributed to enhanced recovery rates produced by
the Harefield Protocol [18]. Findings of similar myocyte size in
both explanted and non-recovered patients treated by this
protocol, suggest Cl’s pro-recovery effects were unrelated to
myocardial size [17]. This present study reinforces this prospect.
We show Cl to be ineffective in preventing myocardial atrophy
associated with prolonged unloading (4 weeks), and this agrees
with previous work [28] in non-failing rat hearts undergoing 2
weeks unloading. In contrast, we previously showed Cl to limit
regression of rodent HF myocyte hypertrophy during short-term
unloading (1 week) [19]. However, such a brief period of MU,
during which atrophic remodelling is regarded as being sub￾maximal [11,13] was considered inadequate, and a poor
representation of prolonged clinical LVAD support.
As we have previously shown [22], Met prevented myocardial
atrophy, but this effect was lost during combined MetCl therapy

with actual worsening of atrophy. The latter observation is
unexpected, if compared with the effects of the combined therapy
in normally-loaded hearts; this can be due to additional
detrimental consequences of mechanical unloading and require
to be further studied. Atrophic remodelling is complex and the
multiple pathways involved poorly defined [32]. The ubiquitin
proteosome, calpain, lysosomal proteolysis and authophagy
systems, and mTOR IGF-1/PI3K/AKT and ERK-1 pathways
are all altered during MU [32]. These growth regulatory
pathways, along with the TGF-b, CAMKII and calcineurin/
NFAT hypertrophic signalling pathways, known components
under b-AR influence [33], may represent Met’s route of action,
and augmentation of myocyte number (not assessed in this study)
via regenerative mechanisms is another possibility. This finding is
particularly important as, to date, no pharmacotherapy has proven
effective in attenuating myocardial atrophy, with success via
haemodynamic loading strategies alone [34], re-emphasising the
critical importance of load in regulation of cardiac mass [13]. Such
loading, potentially brought about by HR reduction and
subsequent augmentation of LV filling, may have driven Met’s
anti-atrophic actions; but the lack of effect during combined
MetCl therapy, despite an equivalent reduction in HR, makes this
mechanism unlikely.
EC coupling during mechanical unloading. LVAD sup￾port induces reversal/alteration in expression and function of
numerous Ca2+ handling elements adversely remodelled during
HF. Recovery of SR Ca2+ content, L-type Ca2+ current fast
inactivation and Ca2+ transient amplitude is seen [35], and these
parameters show positive correlation with functional recovery in
patients treated with the Harefield Protocol [17]. LVAD-induced
enhanced SERCA 2A expression [36] and stabilisation of RyR
function [37] are potentially involved mechanisms.
In the present study, MU recovered HF-induced deranged EC
coupling with normalisation of Ca2+ transient amplitude, speed of
Ca2+ release and sarcomeric contraction, SR Ca2+ content, Ca2+
spark frequency, L-type Ca2+ current amplitude and t-tubule
density. Drug effects on this recovery were not clear-cut but
overall, the positive effects of either mono-therapy disappeared
during combined therapy. MU-induced recovery of Ca2+ transient
amplitude, speed of Ca2+ release and SR Ca2+ content, proven
markers of recovery during LVAD support [17], were equally
enhanced by Cl and Met mono-therapy, with Cl also enhancing
speed of sarcomeric contraction. These effects were lost during

combined therapy along with MU-induced recovery of RyR
function (normalised Ca2+ spark frequency).
Cl’s effects may originate from improved myofilament sensitivity
[19] and SERCA2a expression [28] previously shown during MU.
MU is associated with increased b2-AR mRNA expression [21]
and adenoviral mediated b2-AR overexpression with improved
function following MU [38]. These findings, coupled with
results from our study, re-enforce the rationale for the use of Cl/
b2-AR agonists during LVAD support. Specific study of b1-AR
blockade during MU is lacking. Hence, mechanisms driving
Met’s effects are speculative. Enhancement of MU-induced
recovery of b-AR responsiveness [35] and/or RyR and
SERCA/phospholamban function/phosphorylation/expression
[36,37], proven actions of b-blockers in non-unloaded failing
myocardium [4] may be involved. Despite mainly beneficial
effects during MU, the antagonism of L-type Ca2+ current and
t-tubule density recovery highlight potentially unwanted effects
of Cl and Met, the significance of which requires further
investigation.
Combined b1-AR blockade and b2-AR stimulation in heart
failure
b-adrenergic signalling. Deranged b-adrenergic signalling
is instrumental in HF pathogenesis [4]. Selective down-regulation/
de-sensitisation of b1-ARs promotes relative augmentation of b2:
b1-ARs ratio and signalling [4,39]. Down-regulation of b1-AR
signalling is thought protective against heightened sympathetic
stimulation, and the clinical efficacy of b1-AR blockade is proven
[4,6,23].
Augmented b2-AR signalling is also considered cardio-protec￾tive [24], and the idea that b2-AR agonism may be beneficial in
clinical HF is long-standing [40], but remains controversial and
poorly studied in humans. Undesirable b2-AR agonist effects such
as elevation of HR and arrhythmia risk shown by certain studies
[41,42], along with fears over increasing LV mass, both
independent prognostic risk factors in cardiac disease [43,44]
tempered enthusiasm for using b2-AR agonists in HF therapy.
These factors, coupled with expanding evidence supporting b￾blocker efficacy [4,6,23], and the phenomenon of b2-AR agonist
tachyphylaxis, rendered the notion of therapeutic b2-AR agonism
illogical and unsound. Hence, little clinical data exists regarding

b2-AR agonist administration within this context, with data
derived from a few small, non-randomised studies in HF patients
[45–46] and chronic lung disease patients with HF, receiving b2-
AR agonist therapy [42,47]. Results are unclear, showing both
sustained [42,45] and transient [46] improvements in cardiac
function, as well as negative functional effects [47].
This study re-enforces the concept that b2-AR agonism
represents a beneficial HF therapeutic strategy, albeit alongside
that of clinically proven b1-AR blockade [24]. Cl’s undesirable
effects of cardiac hypertrophy and tachycardia were inhibited by
Met with no evidence of pro-arrhythmic behaviour (Figure S1 in
Methods S1). Combined MetCl therapy displayed superior
improvement in whole heart systolic function to either mono￾therapy, although a cellular mechanism explaining this superiority
was not apparent. Met and Cl showed different positive EC
coupling effects with evidence of selected antagonism rather than
synergy. Met’s improvement of cellular contraction, relaxation,
Ca2+ release, Ca2+ transient amplitude, and SR Ca2+ was not
enhanced by Cl. T-tubule disruption uncouples the normally tight
relationship between L-type Ca2+ channels and RyRs, reducing
EC coupling efficiency [48]. Cl improved this coupling shown by
recovery of L-type Ca2+ current and t-tubule density, along with
RyR function (normalised Ca2+ spark frequency). Such improve￾ments appeared not to alter cellular contractility, but were
abolished by Met.
Additive anti-apoptotic effects of either Cl [20] or fenoterol [24]
in combination with Met, demonstrated by previous rodent HF
studies [20,24] may be responsible for the whole heart functional
effects. Such a mechanism is plausible, as opposing actions of the
two b-adrenergic signalling pathways on cell survival is recognised;
b1-AR signalling broadly promoting apoptosis [25] and b2-AR
signalling driving improved myocyte viability [26,27]. Restoration
of Ca2+ handling protein expression e.g SERCA2a or RyR
[18,20], myo-filament sensitivity [19] and myocardial stiffness/
diastolic function [49] represent other properties of Cl and Met,
that may underpin the augmented function seen during combined
therapy; and afterload (blood pressure (BP)) reduction is another.
However, at similar doses to those used in this study, chronic Met
[20,50], Cl [20] or combined therapy [20] has not been seen to
significantly alter BP. b2-AR agonist tachyphylaxis is recognised
following chronic administration [24,45]. Temporal functional
effects were not assessed in this study, and whether tachyphylaxis
occurred is unknown. The loss of Cl’s chronotropic effect at week
4 suggests it may have done. In a longer rodent HF study (1 year),
Met was shown to prevent b2-AR agonist (fenoterol) tachyphylaxis
(caused by decreased b2-AR density), producing extension of
fenoterol’s positive functional effects. Such a process may also
explain the findings from our, albeit shorter study.
Conclusions
In conclusion, our study shows that Met but not Cl prevented
MU-induced myocardial atrophy, with atrophic worsening during
combined therapy. Cl and Met broadly enhanced MU-induced
recovery of deranged EC coupling, but this enhancement was lost
during combined therapy. These results suggest that A) Cl’s
success in enhancing functional recovery in LVAD-supported
patients is unrelated to myocardial size and reliant on positive EC
coupling effects and B) either the strategy of b2-AR stimulation or
b1-AR blockade is likely to be superior to that of combined b2-AR
stimulation +b1-AR blockade in enhancing functional recovery
during LVAD support. Such findings warrant further investiga￾tion.
In the second part of this study, we show for the first time in a
model of established rodent HF that combined b2-AR simulation
(Cl) +b1-AR blockade (Met) displays superior functional effects to
either mono-therapy, and undesirable Cl-induced hypertrophic/
chronotropic effects are prevented by Met. Mechanisms underly￾ing this superiority appeared independent of cellular EC coupling
and require further investigation. These results suggest that this
pharmacological strategy is likely to be safe and beneficial in HF
therapy.
Limitations
Met was used in this study to facilitate comparison with previous
studies using this rodent HF model. Bisoprolol and not Met is used
in the Harefield Protocol. As such, findings from this study may
not be directly applicable to this specific clinical scenario.
