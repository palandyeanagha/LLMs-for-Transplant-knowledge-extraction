Abstract
Background: Since the inception of the GO annotation project, a variety of tools have been
developed that support exploring and searching the GO database. In particular, a variety of tools
that perform GO enrichment analysis are currently available. Most of these tools require as input
a target set of genes and a background set and seek enrichment in the target set compared to the
background set. A few tools also exist that support analyzing ranked lists. The latter typically rely
on simulations or on union-bound correction for assigning statistical significance to the results.
Results: GOrilla is a web-based application that identifies enriched GO terms in ranked lists of
genes, without requiring the user to provide explicit target and background sets. This is particularly
useful in many typical cases where genomic data may be naturally represented as a ranked list of
genes (e.g. by level of expression or of differential expression). GOrilla employs a flexible threshold
statistical approach to discover GO terms that are significantly enriched at the top of a ranked gene
list. Building on a complete theoretical characterization of the underlying distribution, called mHG,
GOrilla computes an exact p-value for the observed enrichment, taking threshold multiple testing
into account without the need for simulations. This enables rigorous statistical analysis of thousand
of genes and thousands of GO terms in order of seconds. The output of the enrichment analysis is
visualized as a hierarchical structure, providing a clear view of the relations between enriched GO
terms.
Conclusion: GOrilla is an efficient GO analysis tool with unique features that make a useful addition
to the existing repertoire of GO enrichment tools. GOrilla's unique features and advantages over
other threshold free enrichment tools include rigorous statistics, fast running time and an effective
graphical representation. GOrilla is publicly available at: http://cbl-gorilla.cs.technion.ac.il
Background
The availability of functional genomics data has increased
dramatically over the last decade, mostly due to the devel￾opment of high-throughput microarray-based technolo￾gies such as expression profiling. Automatic mining of
these data for meaningful biological signals requires sys￾tematic annotation of genomic elements at different lev￾els. The Gene Ontology (GO) project [1] is a collaborative

effort aimed at providing a controlled vocabulary to
describe gene product attributes in all organisms. GO con￾sists of three hierarchically structured vocabularies (ontol￾ogies) that describe gene products in terms of their
associated biological processes, cellular components and
molecular functions. The building blocks of GO are terms,
the relationship between which can be described by a
directed acyclic graph (DAG), a hierarchy in which each
gene product may be annotated to one or more terms in
each ontology.
Since its inception, many tools have been developed to
explore, filter and search the GO database. A comprehen￾sive list of available tools is provided at the Gene Ontol￾ogy web site http://www.geneontology.org. One of the
most common applications of the GO vocabulary is
enrichment analysis – the identification of GO terms that
are significantly overrepresented in a given set of genes
[2]. Enrichment may suggest possible functional charac￾teristics of the given set. For example, enriched GO terms
in a set of genes that are significantly over-expressed in a
specific condition may suggest possible mechanisms of
regulation that are put into play, or functional pathways
that are activated in that condition.
A large repertoire of tools for enrichment analysis has
been developed in recent years, including GoMiner [3],
FatiGO [4], BiNGO [5], GOAT [6], DAVID [7] and others.
In general, these tools accept as input a target set of genes
that is compared to a given background set of genes, or to
a default "complete" background set. Some subset of GO
terms from one or more of the three ontologies is scanned
for enrichment in the target set relative to the background
set, and terms for which significant enrichment is discov￾ered are reported. The statistical test used for enrichment
analysis is typically based on a hypergeometric or bino￾mial model.
The most common form of output is a list of enriched
terms. This simple approach allows the user to identify
terms that are most significantly enriched but may lose
substantial information regarding the relations between
these terms. A more informative approach is to present
the enrichment results in the context of the DAG structure
of the respective ontology. In a typical case, the list of sig￾nificantly enriched GO terms may include several related
terms at varying significance levels. Identifying the clusters
of enriched terms in the GO hierarchy becomes much
simpler if the DAG structure is made available. A few tools
visualize the results of enrichment analysis in the DAG
structure, including the downloadable version of GoM￾iner [3], the CytoScape plug-in BiNGO [5], GOLEM [8],
GOEAST [9] and GOTM [10]. A particularly friendly and
useful GO enrichment analysis tool is GO::TermFinder
which is provided at the Saccharomyces Genome Data￾base (SGD, [11]). This tool provides a color-coded map of
the enriched GO terms. It is, however, limited only to
analysis of S. cerevisiae genes and requires specifying an
explicit target set.
In many practical cases, functional genomic information
used as the input for the GO enrichment analysis may be
naturally represented as a ranked list. For most applica￾tions, the requirement for an input target gene set forces
the user to set some arbitrary threshold and define the tar￾get set as all genes with ranks above (or below) the thresh￾old. For example, genes may be naturally scored and
ranked according to their differential expression between
two conditions. However, defining the specific set of
genes that are differentially expressed requires setting an
arbitrary threshold. Unfortunately, the results of the
enrichment analysis may often depend on the specific
threshold that is set. Tools that use the simple hypergeo￾metric distribution require setting such a fixed threshold.
A few tools have been developed that use a threshold free
approach including GSEA [12], FatiScan [13], GO-stat
[14], GeneTrail [15] and iGA [16]. The widely used GSEA
tool uses a statistic that is similar to Kolmogorov-Smirnov
but assigns different weights to the occurrences of genes in
different ranks in the list. The tool is not specifically aimed
at GO enrichment, and therefore does not offer visualiza￾tion in terms of the GO DAG structure. In addition GSEA
does not provide an exact p-value and estimates the p￾value using permutations. The p-values assigned by GSEA
are therefore limited by the number of permutations per￾formed. FatiScan is another threshold free tool by the cre￾ators of FatiGO. It tests a number of thresholds
determined by the user (the default is 30 thresholds) and
then corrects for multiple testing using FDR. Again, this
tool does not provide an exact p-value. The iGA method
uses an iterative approach that circumvents the need for a
fixed cutoff by computing the hypergeometric score at all
possible cutoffs. iGA does not produce an exact p-value as
well. In [17] the authors study the advantages of sample
re-sampling. The sample permutation approach is appli￾cable for the analysis of differential gene expression data
but not in other applications of gene set enrichment
where ranking is inferred otherwise.
As a matter of practicality it is also important for GO
enrichment tools to perform in an interactive manner.
Many of the existing tools, in particular those based on
flexible thresholds that require time consuming simula￾tions, fall short on this desired property.
In this note we describe a web-server interactive software
tool, called GOrilla, that enables GO enrichment analysis
in ranked lists of genes. It is based on previous work [18],
in which we describe a statistical framework, called mHG,

for enrichment analysis in ranked lists. The method iden￾tifies, independently for each GO term, the threshold at
which the most significant enrichment is obtained. The
significance score is accurately and tightly corrected for
threshold multiple testing without the need for time con￾suming simulations. Consequentially GOrilla performs
the enrichment analysis on thousands of genes and thou￾sands of GO terms in a few seconds. In the Results section
we demonstrate how GOrilla can capture relevant biolog￾ical processes and visualize the results with an easy to use
graphical representation of the GO hierarchy, emphasiz￾ing on the enriched nodes.
Implementation
Enrichment Analysis
A standard approach for identifying enriched GO terms
uses the hypergeometric distribution (e.g. [8]). Given a
total number of genes N, with B of these genes associated
with a particular GO term and n of these genes in the tar￾get set, then the probability that b or more genes from the
target set are associated with the given GO term is given by
the hypergeometric tail:
If a ranked gene list: g1,...,gN is provided in place of a target
set, we define a label vector = 1,..., N ∈ {0, 1}N according
to the association of the ranked genes to the given GO
term, i = 1 iff gi is associated with the term. The minimum
hypergeometric (mHG) score is then defined as:
where . In words, the mHG score is the
optimal HGT probability that is found over all possible
partitions induced by the gene ranking. As such, this score
must be corrected for multiple testing. In previous work
we describe a dynamic programming algorithm for com￾puting the exact p-value of a given mHG score [18]. More
specifically, given a ranked list of genes, a GO term asso￾ciated with some of these genes and a corresponding
mHG score s, the mHG p-value tells us the exact probabil￾ity of observing an mHG score s' ≤ s under the null
assumption that all GO term occurrence configurations in
the ranked list are equiprobable. We describe various con￾siderations for efficient implementation of the mHG p￾value algorithm elsewhere [19].
Description of the Tool
GOrilla is publicly available as a web-based application at:
http://cbl-gorilla.cs.technion.ac.il. The application has
two modes of operation:
1. Discovery of enriched GO terms at the top of a ranked
list of genes using the mHG statistics (as explained in this
paper).
2. Discovery of enriched GO terms in a target set versus a
background set and using a hypergeometric model (as
commonly done in other applications). In this case the
ranking inside these lists is ignored.
The web interface of GOrilla is shown in Figure 1. The
input to the application is a ranked list or two sets
(depending on the mode of operation) that consist of
gene names in the following formats: gene symbol, pro￾tein RefSeq, Uniprot, Unigene or Ensembl. Gene duplica￾tion often occurs in such lists, which can lead to
statistically biased results. GOrilla automatically removes
duplicates keeping the highest ranking occurrence. This
includes dealing with duplicates that hide behind differ￾ent nomenclatures. GOrilla currently supports the follow￾ing organisms: human, mouse, rat, yeast, D. melanogaster,
C. elegans and Arabidopsis thaliana.
The output consists of a color-coded trimmed DAG of all
significantly enriched GO terms. The output also includes
a table consisting of the enriched GO terms (with web
links to additional information), the enrichment p-values
(computed under the null model as described above) and
the relevant annotated genes. The nodes of the resulting
DAG, which represent GO terms, are color-coded accord￾ing to the significance of the detected enrichment and
clickable, leading to the relevant entry in the above table.
Results can be exported to Excel. Figure 2 depicts an exam￾ple of the result of enrichment analysis, where the rela￾tions between enriched terms can be observed. To
generate the GO DAG visualization, GOrilla employs
AT&T's GraphViz tool [20].
Results and discussion
To test the performance of GOrilla we used the van't Veer
et al. breast cancer dataset [21], which is a landmark study
in clinical use of gene expression data. This dataset con￾sists of expression profiles containing 14,565 genes meas￾ured on 77 breast cancer patients. Different patients
showed various prognostic characteristics, 44 with more
than 5 years survival versus 33 patients with less than 5
years survival. All genes were ranked according to how
well they differentiate between the two groups using a
simple t-test. The top of the list contained the genes that
were the best separators between the two groups. The
ranked list was given as input to GOrilla with default run￾Prob HGT ( ) (; , , ) ,

How to use the Figure 1 GOrilla web user interface
How to use the GOrilla web user interface. To use the GOrilla web interface, the user is required to perform the follow￾ing four simple steps: (i) choose an organism; (ii) choose a running mode (either flexible threshold or fixed threshold mode) 
(iii) copy and paste a list (or upload a file) of genes in the case of a flexible threshold or two lists of genes – a target and a back￾ground – in the case of a fixed cutoff; (iv) choose an ontology.

ning parameters. The result is shown in Fig 2 and high￾lights a unique set of enriched GO terms that were
identified at different cutoffs. The enriched GO terms
include mitosis (p < 10-12, top 717 genes), cell cycle (p <
10-13, top 692 genes) and microtubule cytoskeleton
organization and biogenesis (p < 10-8, top 927 genes).
These enriched GO terms are attributed to genes that were
over expressed in patients with bad prognosis and under￾expressed in patients with good prognosis, which is in
accordance with biological common sense and supports
their relevance. The total analysis running time was less
than 10 seconds.
A comparison to other web-based tools was performed on
the same dataset using each software's default parameters.
Web-based tools have several advantages over standalone
An example of the Figure 2 GOrilla analysis output
An example of the GOrilla analysis output. 14,565 genes from the van't Veer dataset were ranked according to their dif￾ferential expression and given as input to GOrilla. The resulting enriched GO terms are visualized using a DAG graphical repre￾sentation with color coding reflecting their degree of enrichment. Nodes in the graph are clickable and give additional 
information on the GO terms and genes attributing to the enrichment. N is the total number of genes; B is the total number of 
genes associated with a specific GO term; n is the flexible cutoff, i.e. the automatically determined number of genes in the 'tar￾get set' and b is the number of genes in the 'target set' that are associated with a specific GO term. Enrichment is defined as (b/
n)/(B/N).

tools [2] and therefore we only compare GOrilla to other
web-based tools. The flexible threshold tools Fatiscan [13]
and GO-stat [14] were given the ranked list as input while
the fixed threshold methods GOEAST and DAVID were
given a target set containing all the genes with t-test p < 10-
3, which includes the top 124 genes, and a background set
containing the rest of the genes. We note that the p < 10-3
choice of fixed threshold for cutting the data, which is
often used for this type of tasks, is inherently arbitrary.
A summary of the comparison between the different tools
is given in Table 1. DAVID and GOEAST which use a fixed
threshold based approach, yielded a similar set of
enriched GO terms to the ones yielded by GOrilla. Most of
these terms were identified with less significant enrich￾ment scores presumably because these methods use an
arbitrary cutoff. The flexible cutoff based methods Fatis￾can did not identify any enriched GO term while the GO￾stat flexible method identified GO terms similar to the
ones obtained by GOrilla. Running time of different tools
varied considerably ranging from a few minutes up to 30
minutes per single analysis, which may be partially due to
Monte-Carlo simulations employed by some of the meth￾ods for assessing the p-value.
Conclusion
The main contribution of the application presented
herein are:
1. Most other approaches to GO enrichment analysis
assume that a target set and a background set are given or
evident to the process. It is often the case, however, that
genomic data which is the subject of the enrichment anal￾ysis step, is naturally represented as a ranked list of ele￾ments. GOrilla uses a statistical model that supports the
discovery of GO terms that are enriched at the top of a
ranked list, enabling a threshold to be determined in a
data driven manner. It also provides an exact p-value for
the observed event, which is not the case for most other
available flexible threshold tools.
2. GOrilla provides a simple and informative graphical
representation of the significantly enriched terms, in the
context of the complete DAG representation of the ontol￾ogy used in the analysis. This graphical representation is
color coded based on the p-value attained for each GO
term.

Different GO enrichment tools employ a wide range of statistics and yield different performances. The main features of five different web-based 
tools are compared to GOrilla. To enable a fair comparison all tools were used using default parameters via their web interfaces and applied on the 
van't Veer dataset. One exception is the SGD tool that only runs on yeast data and was therefore tested on a set of 543 yeast genes and the default 
background for running time characterization. The GOrilla running time for this yeast dataset was also 7 seconds. The running time was measured 
for the entire analysis, including uploading files and getting the results.

of a few seconds per analysis. This is achieved by using an
