Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a worldwide public health
problem. In the United States, between 1988–1994 and
2005–2010, the overall prevalence estimate for CKD, defined
by an estimation of glomerular filtration rate <60 ml/min per
1.73m2 or a urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio 30 mg/g, rose
from 12.3 to 14.0%. In 2010, overall per person per year costs
for patients with CKD reached $22,323 for Medicare patients
65 years and older, and the overall Medicare expenditure for
CKD was $41.0 billion, which consisted of 17% of the total
Medicare dollars allocated.1
Kidney transplantation is the treatment of choice for pa￾tients with end-stage renal disease and should be discussed
with patients with advanced CKD preparing for renal replace￾ment therapy.2 The annual number of kidney transplants in the
United States extends beyond 17,000 patients (deceased do￾nors to living donors), and potential candidates should be
referred promptly to a transplant center. Graft dysfunction
arising after renal transplant can be divided into urologic
(urine leaks or obstruction), vascular, perirenal fluid collec￾tions, and infectious complications. Perirenal transplant fluid
collections can develop in the immediate postoperative period
or over several months. The differential diagnosis of a perirenal
fluid collection immediately after surgery includes seroma,
hematoma, and urinoma, and fluid collections that develop in
a subacute fashion include abscess or lymphoceles.
Lymphoceles are a common and well-documented compli￾cation in renal transplant recipients, occurring in up to 26% of
patients.3 Usually they are found incidentally on routine
ultrasonography and require no additional management;
however, a small number are symptomatic due to mass effect
and require further definitive treatment. Treatment options
include laparoscopic/open surgical or percutaneous therapies
with each having different profiles of efficacy and complica￾tions. At my institution, we commonly use less invasive
percutaneous therapies initially, with surgical management
reserved for percutaneous treatment failure. Potential current
options for the interventional radiologist include simple aspi￾ration, catheter drainage, and sclerotherapy. In a recent sys￾tematic review of 52 retrospective case series (1113 cases of
primary lymphocele), treatment efficacy was evaluated and
demonstrated recurrence rates of 59% (141 cases; n ¼ 218),
50% (100 cases; n ¼ 195), and 31% (41 cases; n ¼ 155) with
aspiration, catheter drainage, and sclerotherapy, respectively.4
Patient Selection
Given the high recurrence rates with current available per￾cutaneous therapies, risk of complications from laparoscopic/
open surgical treatment modalities and need for hospitaliza￾tion with surgical management, we have recently used an
alternative percutaneous strategy in the management of
postrenal transplant lymphoceles. This technique involves
ultrasound and fluoroscopic-guided percutaneous transper￾itoneal balloon fenestration of the lymphocele. No specific
guidelines have been adopted for patient selection; however,
it is usually performed early in the work-up and diagnosis of
the lymphocele, and theoretically the procedure is more
efficacious with simple unilocular fluid collections. This
procedure can also be performed in angiography suites
with standard equipment and potentially reduces the dwell
time for drainage catheters. More traditional treatment mo￾dalities should be entertained if the perirenal lymphocele
recurs or resists percutaneous balloon fenestration.
Procedure
All available imaging modalities should be reviewed before
any intervention on a posttransplant fluid collection to assist
the operator in treatment. The diagnosis of a lymphocele is
usually suspected by ultrasound; however, the first step in
treatment of these collections is confirming the diagnosis
with aspiration and biochemical analysis of the fluid.
Under moderate sedation, focused ultrasound of the graft
is performed in the angiography suite under standard sterile
technique to determine the relationship of the fluid collection
in respect to the graft, urinary bladder, and adjacent vascular
structures. Under direct ultrasound guidance, access the
collection with either a 5F Yueh centesis catheter needle

(Cook Medical, Bloomington, IN) or an 18-gauge needle with
Chiba tip, and aspirate 5 mL of fluid for biochemical analysis.
Submit the fluid to the laboratory for creatinine level, routine
culture/gram stain, and cell count with differential. A lym￾phocele is diagnosed when the creatinine of the aspirated
fluid is similar to that of serum and when the specimen
contains predominantly lymphocytes. Culture results are
useful to diagnosis concomitant infection that may affect
the algorithm or timing of treatment.
Place a small-bore multipurpose pigtail drainage catheter
into the perigraft fluid collection using standard Seldinger
technique and fluoroscopic guidance. A small pigtail catheter
that is ethanol compatible such as the 8.5F Dawson-Mueller
drainage catheter (Cook Medical, Bloomington, IN) is pre￾ferred. This type of catheter gives you flexibility, permitting
sclerotherapy with ethanol to treat the fluid collection with￾out the need for a catheter exchange. Connect the catheter to
a Merit drainage depot bag (Merit Medical, South Jordan, UT)
left open to gravity drainage. The patient is instructed how to
care for the drainage catheter, asked to record daily outputs,
and scheduled for follow-up outpatient percutaneous thera￾py within 24 to 48 hours. This gives you time to obtain the
necessary laboratory studies, which will confirm the diagno￾sis, and to acquire a sense of the fluid collection outputs.
Once the diagnosis of a lymphocele is confirmed and after
discussion with the referring surgeon, proceed with image￾guided percutaneous transperitoneal balloon fenestration.
This technique is performed on an outpatient basis under
moderate sedation. The indwelling drainage catheter and
surrounding abdominal wall are sterilized in standard fash￾ion, and subsequently iodinated contrast (diluted with nor￾mal saline) is injected into the lymphocele through the
indwelling percutaneous catheter. It is helpful if the patient
does not void prior to the examination, allowing direct
ultrasound visualization and delineation of the lymphocele
with respect to the bladder (►Fig. 1).
Place an 18-gauge needle with Chiba tip into the lympho￾cele from a midline or paramedian approach, puncturing the
collection along its ventral surface. Using the Seldinger
technique, advance a 0.035 Bentson guidewire (Cook Medical,
Bloomington, IN) under fluoroscopic guidance coiled into the
fluid collection (►Fig. 2). Directional access into the fluid
collection at this point is important; the goal is to traverse the
intraperitoneal space with your wire. As discussed later, this

technique ultimately fenestrates the lymphocele with your
angioplasty balloon, thus creating a “window” that commu￾nicates with the intraperitoneal space. Careful ultrasound
access will allow you to avoid adjacent bowel and vascular
structures.
Over wire, I dilate the subcutaneous tissues and place a
standard 8F vascular sheath (Cordis Corp., Bridgewater, NJ)
with distal tip in the collection. Use a sheath to introduce the
angioplasty balloon, which theoretically decreases the risk of
rectus muscle trauma that could occur with a “bare-back”
balloon over-wire approach. Start with a 14F Conquest PTA
balloon (Bard Peripheral Vascular, Inc., Tempe, AZ) and
advance the device through the sheath. The location of the
balloon, with the distal portion in the fluid collection and
proximal portion outside the ventral wall of the fluid collec￾tion, should be confirmed by fluoroscopy and ultrasound
prior to high-pressure inflation. Retract the sheath to allow
full expansion of the device; insufflate the balloon for 60 sec￾onds and subsequently remove it over wire through the
sheath (►Fig. 3).
To evaluate for creation of a fenestration, inject the in￾dwelling small-bore drainage catheter with full-strength
contrast, and using digital subtraction angiography (DSA),
assess for intraperitoneal extravasation of contrast (►Fig. 4).
Perform this sequence of events two to three additional times
to create multiple fenestrations along the ventral wall of the
lymphocele. More fenestrations will optimize drainage, so at
this point either reaccess the lymphocele from a different
direction or remove the small-bore drainage catheter over
wire. Simply upsizing the angioplasty balloon will widen the
fenestration and potentially augment drainage. At the end of
the procedure, remove the wires and sheaths, and cap the
small-bore drainage catheter after aspirating all contents.
Typically the patient is scheduled to return to the inter￾ventional radiology department in 48 to 72 hours for ultra￾sound to assess the need for further treatment. If the
lymphocele is not visualized at that time, cut and remove
the drain (►Fig. 5). If the lymphocele remains, initiate a
second trial of percutaneous balloon fenestration.

Discussion
CKD is a worldwide public health problem, and the preva￾lence in the United States has been increasing over the last
2 decades. Kidney transplantation is the treatment of choice
for patients with end-stage renal disease with >17,000 renal
transplants performed in the United States alone. Interven￾tional radiologists are consulted to manage assorted renal
transplant complications including perirenal fluid collec￾tions. Lymphoceles are a common and well-documented
complication in renal transplant recipients with various
treatment modalities available including aspiration and
drainage (with or without sclerotherapy) and open surgery.
We have found that optimal treatment of these patients
requires collaboration with the referring transplant surgical
team. At my institution we have adopted an alternative
percutaneous method to treat lymphoceles with image-guid￾ed percutaneous transperitoneal balloon fenestration.
