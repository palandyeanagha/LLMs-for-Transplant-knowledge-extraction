Abstract. Chemoembolization with lipiodol (TACE) improves 
survival of selected patients with unresectable hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC), but results in substantial toxicity. To improve 
treatment tolerance, we conducted this phase II study using 
doxorubicin-loaded beads (DC Beads®) delivered by selective 
transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (DEB-TACE). We 
compared the results with those obtained with TACE in our 
historical controls. Thirty-five patients were recruited with 
diagnoses of HCC. Patients received DEB-TACE with doxo￾rubicin loaded on DC Beads. Computed tomography of the 
upper abdomen was performed one month after DEB-TACE. 
Historical controls were a group of 70 patients with matched 
characteristics treated with TACE. After a median follow-up 
of 14.1 months (range, 6-36 months), 22 patients (63%) had 
an objective response. There was a statistically significant 
decrease in liver enzymes (P<0.001), lactate dehydrogenase, 
(P<0.001) in DEB-TACE-treated patients compared to 
TACE-treated patients. DEB-TACE with doxorubicin-loaded 
DC Beads, a safe and reliable treatment for HCC, leads to 
decreased toxicity compared to TACE.
Introduction
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the fifth most common 
neoplasm and the third most common cause of cancer-related 
death, is an important health problem, with more than half a 
million new cases registered annually worldwide (1). Application 
of screening programs, advances in diagnostic imaging, and the 
increasing incidence of hepatitis C virus underlie the increasing 
incidence of HCC in Western countries and Japan (2). The HCC 
that develops in 80-90% of cases of cirrhotic liver is the main 
cause of death among cirrhotic patients (2).
The best therapeutic results occur after liver transplanta￾tion with resection of the entire potentially tumor-bearing liver 
and elimination of cirrhosis. However, transplantation can be 
offered only to a minority of patients due to the shortage of 
donors and the high cost of the procedure (3). Most patients 
are not amenable to potentially curative partial hepatectomy 
because the tumor is in an advanced stage and liver function 
is poor at the time of diagnosis (4). For this reason, various 
locoregional therapies are used for patients who are not surgical 
candidates as a result of the severity of the liver disease or 
advanced HCC stage. These modalities include local ablative 
therapy (radiofrequency ablation, microwave coagulation 
therapy, or percutaneous ethanol injection) and transarterial 
chemoembolization with lipiodol (TACE). In HCC, the hepatic 
artery provides 90-100% of the blood supply to the tumor and 
is used as a roadway for direct delivery of therapeutic agents 
to the tumor while the non-neoplastic liver is not damaged (4).
TACE has become the most popular modality for palliative 
treatment among non-surgical candidates. Two randomized 
trials from Europe and Asia confirmed better survival associ￾ated with TACE vs. conservative treatment in selected patients 
(5,6). In recent years, TACE with an emulsion of doxorubicin 
with lipiodol followed by embolization with a gelatin sponge 
has been used commonly for HCC treatment (7,8); however, 
the treated tumors exhibited a high frequency of recurrence 
after TACE (9-11). In addition, the most common complication 
of TACE is the post-embolization syndrome, which consists 
of fever, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, leukocytosis, and 
increased liver enzymes lasting from a few hours to a few 
days (10). The post-embolization syndrome has widely vari￾able manifestations, is experienced after 80-90% of TACE 
procedures, is treated symptomatically and, in most patients, 
decreases in severity with subsequent TACE but may prolong 
hospitalization (11). The chemotherapeutic and embolizing 
agents may also cause acute cholecystitis, biliary tract necrosis, 
pancreatitis, gastric erosions, or ulcers if they are inadvertently

injected into these organs. Infection of the necrotic tumor 
presenting as liver abscess can also occur (10).
Recently, microspheres (DC Beads®, Biocompatibles UK, 
Ltd., Surrey, UK) that can be labeled with antineoplastic drugs, 
delivered by selective transcatheter arterial chemoemboliza￾tion (DEB-TACE), have been utilized for the treatment of HCC 
(12,13). These particles provide two major advantages over 
conventional TACE. First, the drug attached to the particles 
is released to the surrounding tissue continuously during the 
first 10-12 days. Second, due to the sustained drug release, the 
plasma levels of the charged drug are supposed to be lower 
than in conventional TACE, resulting in fewer systemic side 
effects (13).
The primary endpoint of the present study was to 
prospectively assess the toxicity of DEB-TACE in a cohort 
of 35 patients with unresectable HCC and to compare it with 
the toxicity of TACE in 70 matched historical controls with 
comparable disease stage and age. The secondary endpoint 
was the assessment of DEB-TACE activity.
Materials and methods
Patient selection. Patients with a diagnosis of HCC who had 
no indication for surgical resection or local ablation therapy 
were enrolled in the present prospective case-control study. 
Inclusion criteria, that were common for the prospectively 
included patients and for the controls, included: age <80 years, 
adequate liver function, Karnofsky performance score >70%, 
no serious associated medical illness, no extrahepatic disease 
on preoperative investigations, no major vessel involvement 
by tumor including the main portal vein, main hepatic artery, 
hepatic veins or inferior vena cava.
HCC was diagnosed by ultrasonography, computed tomog￾raphy (CT), magnetic resonance imaging, angiography, and 
the measurement of serum levels of α-fetoprotein (AFP). A 
combination of AFP and imaging was used in 12 patients for 
whom histological examination was not performed.
Liver-function criteria for enrollment included Child A or 
B class, bilirubin <3 mg/dl, and aspartate aminotransferase 
(AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) <270 IU/l. None of 
the patients were candidates for liver transplantation. Patients 
with creatinine >2 mg/dl, port systemic shunts, hepatofugal 
blood flow, thrombosis of the main portal vein, extrahepatic 
metastases, and tumor burden (>50% of the liver volume) 
were excluded. Tumor stage was estimated by the Okuda￾Child classification (14). Informed consent was obtained from 
all patients. This study protocol was approved by the local 
Ethics Committee and was conducted in accordance with the 
Declaration of Helsinki.
Drug-eluting microspheres/beads. The DEB-TACE procedure 
was performed with local analgesia, antibiotic prophylaxis, 
and antiemetic drugs. Particular attention was paid to post￾embolization pain control with a combination of opioids and 
fans. Patients received DEB-TACE via DC Beads loaded with 
doxorubicin at a dose of 50 mg/m2
 (15). The microspheres were 
left in solution with doxorubicin over 2 h. Microsphere size was 
chosen according to the tumor size. For tumors >5 cm the size 
was between 500 and 700 µm, for tumors between 5 and 3 cm, 
the size was 300-500 µm, while for tumors <3 cm the size was 
300 µm. Prior to each embolization, angiography of the hepatic 
and mesenteric arteries was performed to demonstrate liver 
arterial anatomy and the feeding vessels of the tumor and to 
check for apparent venous shunts. DC Beads were then aspirated 
from the vial into a syringe and mixed with saline solution and 
non-ionic contrast medium (300-400 mg/ml iodine). Once the 
catheter was in place in the artery feeding the tumor, the DC 
Beads were infused selectively into the vessel until stasis was 
evident. Lobar or segmental embolization was performed in the 
case of diffuse tumors. If hepatic vein shunting was identified 
angiographically, larger particles or preliminary shunt embo￾lization were implemented to minimize the risk of non-target 
pulmonary embolization.
Follow-up. CT and contrast-enhanced ultrasound were used 
to assess results, while magnetic resonance imaging was used 
only to search for satellite lesions or new tumors that would 
modify the clinical decision. CT consisted of three phases 
performed on a spiral CT scanner. The scans were obtained 
through the liver in the craniocaudal direction with 5-mm 
collimation. For the three-phase CT, the hepatic arterial, 
portal venous, and delayed phases were scanned at 30, 60 and 
180 sec, respectively, after the start of the injection of 120 ml 
of non-ionic iodinated contrast material. Magnetic resonance 
imaging included T1 fat-suppressed images, T2 fat-suppressed 
sequences and dynamic fat-suppressed T1 sequences with 
gadolinium enhancement.
Modified response evaluation criteria in solid tumors 
(RECIST) criteria were used to evaluate responses to treatment 
(16). Imaging follow-up was scheduled at baseline (before the 
procedure) and 1 month after each treatment. Follow-up was 
performed 4, 7 and 9 months after procedures.
In each imaging evaluation the longest diameter of the 
tumor, the longest diameter of the enhancing/viable tumor, 
and the percentage of necrosis post-treatment were recorded. 
Necrosis was defined as a non-enhancing and low-fluid density 
intratumoral area.
Patients were evaluated for toxicity at each study visit 
according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity 
Criteria (NCI-CTC) Version 2.0.11. AFP levels were measured 
at follow-up, while ALT, AST and lactate dehydrogenase 
(LDH) levels were measured before and daily after the proce￾dure.
Statistical analysis. The primary objective of the study was 
to determine whether DEB-TACE with DC Beads produced 
a decrease in toxicity vs. TACE with lipiodol. The number of 
patients required to identify a statistically significant (P≤0.05) 
decrease of ≥25% in the post-embolization AST value was 
calculated to be 35 subjects in the experimental group and 
70 subjects in the control group providing a statistical power 
>90%. The results of the laboratory tests were expressed as 
the mean ± standard deviation of four determinations, and 
the differences were determined using a repeated-measure 
analysis of variance. Secondary endpoints were response, 
relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS). The 
RFS was defined as the time between the embolization to any 
relapse and the appearance of a second primary cancer or death, 
whichever occurred first. The OS was measured from study 
entry to death, or June 30, 2011 for censored patients. RFS and 

ONCOLOGY REPORTS 27: 1377-1383, 2012 1379
OS were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method (17). All 
comparisons were performed using Pearson's χ2
 contingency 
table analysis. The log-rank test was used to compare the RFS 
and OS of the two groups. Statistical analysis was performed 
with SAS statistical software (version 8.12, 2000; SAS Institute 
Inc., Cary, NC, USA).
Results
Patient characteristics. Between January 2008 and December 
2010, 35 patients were recruited (25 males and 10 females) 
with a median age of 72 years (range, 53-80 years). All patients 
had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) perfor￾mance status 0-1. The total number of lesions was 54 (range, 
1-3 per patient) with a median diameter of 4.12 cm (range, 1-9 
cm). Okuda-Child stages were determined to be 1A (n=6), 1B 
(n=8), 2A (n=6) and 2B (n=15) (Table I).
The control patients (n=70) possessed similar character￾istics regarding age, disease status, performance status, and 
number of hepatic lesions (Table I).
Tumor response and patient survival. After a median follow-up 
of 14.1 months (range, 6-40 months), a total of 61 DEB-TACEs 
were delivered (range, 1-4 treatments per patient). According 
to the modified RECIST criteria, an objective overall response 
rate was observed in 22 patients (63%): complete response 
in 7 patients (20%), partial response in 15 patients (43%), 
stable disease in 9 patients (26%), and progressive disease 
in 4 patients (11%; Table II). Seven partial responses were 
converted to complete responses after a second treatment, 
while five stable diseases were converted to partial responses 
(Table II). The median RFS was 13.1 months (range, 1-36+ 
months), while the median OS was 18.4 months. Two patients 
remained in complete response at the time of death caused by 
liver failure. Eleven patients (31%) were alive at the time of 
analysis with a significant (P<0.05) decrease of AFP level with 
respect to pretreatment values. Nine percent of the historical 
controls were alive at the time of this analysis; their median 
RFS was 8.4 months while their median OS was 11.4 months. 
There was no statistically significant difference in RFS or OS 
between the two groups of patients (Figs. 1 and 2).
Toxicity. Table III contains a summary of adverse effects in 
the two treatment groups. The incidence of nausea/vomiting 
in the TACE group was significantly higher than that in the 
DEB-TACE group (P<0.001). The median length of hospi￾talization was 4.7±0.7 days for TACE and 2.3±0.1 days for 
DEB-TACE (P<0.0001). Causes of hospitalization included 
fever and other treatment-related complications. Increases in 
the ALT and LDH levels were observed for 9 days and at 4 days 
for the TACE and DEB-TACE groups, respectively (data not 
shown). Mean baseline AST values did not statistically differ 
between groups: 109±12 (IU) for the TACE group and 116±31 
for the DEB-TACE group. After the procedures the difference 
between the mean AST values became statistically significant 
(P<0.05): 805±125 for TACE and 238±57 for DEB-TACE 
(Fig. 3). Similar observations were obtained for LDH levels;

ONCOLOGY REPORTS 27: 1377-1383, 2012 1381
baseline LDH values were 652±24 (IU) in the TACE group 
and 584±53 in the DEB-TACE group (P<0.1), and after the 
procedures, the mean LDH value increased to 5399±800 IU 
for the TACE group and 1153±251 for the DEB-TACE group 
(P<0.005; Fig. 4). No toxicity-related death was observed in the 
total pool of 105 patients treated with the two procedures. We 
observed hepatic artery damage in two patients treated with 
TACE and in no patients treated with DEB-TACE. No patient 
exhibited occlusion of the hepatic artery. No other serious 
complications or treatment-related deaths were observed in 
either group as shown in Figs. 5 and 6.
Discussion
Randomized trials have established that with respect to best 
supportive care, TACE prolongs the survival of a selected 
group of patients with unresectable HCC and is an effective 
palliative treatment (18,19). In addition, a large meta-analysis 
clearly demonstrated that in patients with unresectable HCC, 
chemoembolization significantly improved the overall 2-year 
survival compared with non-active treatment (20).
Loading the drug doxorubicin onto microspheres represents 
a new modality for precise delivery; once the microspheres are 
injected into the tumor, they slowly release doxorubicin over 
14 days, causing a prolonged, concentrated exposure to the 
drug, with increased cell death and decreased acute toxicity 
(12). A recent study reported a significantly decreased toxicity 
of DEB-TACE due to significantly lower plasma doxorubicin 
concentration with DC Beads (21). Conventional TACE delivers 
drugs less selectively into liver lesions and causes damage to 
the surrounding liver tissue, with elevation of liver enzymes 
and acceleration of underlying liver disease (22). Following 
refinement of the technique with superselective angiography, 
the drug is now precisely delivered to the lesion, is released 
slowly, and has an improved impact on the surrounding liver 
parenchyma.
In another clinical study, the authors hypothesized that 
DEB-TACE presented a better local response, fewer recur￾rences, and a longer RFS, due to complete devascularization 
of the lesion, leading to reduced neoangiogenesis (23).
The aims of this case-control study were the evaluation 
of DEB-TACE toxicity, its activity in 35 patients with unre￾sectable HCC and the comparison of these results with those 
obtained from a group of 70 TACE-treated controls with the 
same pathology. The historical controls were selected to have 
characteristics similar to our patients.
In our study, toxicity following DEB-TACE was signifi￾cantly decreased with respect to lipiodol chemoembolization. 
The length of hospital stay decreased from a mean of 5 days to 
a mean of 3 days (P<0.001), and postoperative complications 
also decreased significantly. The lowered toxicity was also 
observed for AST and LDH. In fact even if there was no statis￾tically significant difference between mean baseline values 
of both AST (P=0.7) and LDH (P=0.1), after the procedure 
the difference became statistically significant for both AST 
(P<0.05) and LDH (P<0.005) (Figs. 3 and 4).
Transcatheter therapy with DC Beads did not provide a 
statistically significant advantage in RFS (Fig. 1) or in OS

(Fig. 2) with respect to TACE in patients with unresectable 
HCC. However, few patients received a large benefit from 
either procedure. Prolonging the life expectancy of these 
patients led to the observation of unusual metastasis sites; 
two patients in each group developed several bone metastases 
three years after the procedure, while two other patients in 
each group died from brain metastases.
Several limitations of our study deserve discussion. 
Although our investigation was not a randomized study, our 
controls were carefully selected from a large pool of 110 
patients treated with TACE. The treating radiologists were 
the same (GP and PF) for all patients, providing uniformity of 
treatment for both groups. A recent retrospective trial exam￾ined a population of 150 patients with liver cirrhosis treated 
between 2002 and 2009 that included 50 patients treated with 
TACE and 32 patients treated with DEB-TACE (24). For the 
entire population the median survival was 32 months, while 
the median time to progression was 24 months. However, it 
must stressed that OS was calculated as the time between the 
date of radiological or histological diagnosis of HCC and the 
date of death or last follow-up, while the RFS was calculated as 
the time between the date of treatment and the date of progres￾sion or last follow-up. In a recently published study, a survival 
benefit was reported with transcatheter DEB-TACE therapy 
over conventional TACE for patients with unresectable HCC 
Although we observed that RFS improved from 8.4 months 
for TACE to 13.1 months for DEB-TACE, the difference was 
not statistically significant; similarly, OS improved from 11.4 
months for TACE to 18.4 months for DEB-TACE, but the 
difference was not statistically significant. The non-significant 
RFS and OS measurements in our study must be considered 
preliminary; further exploration will come after February 
2012 after completion of the prospective randomized study 
NCT00539643 by Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center 
evaluating the role of doxorubicin added to DC Beads in HCC 
treatment.
Recently, the orally available multi-targeted receptor 
tyrosine kinase inhibitor sorafenib demonstrated a statistically 
significant improvement in median OS after 3 months versus 
the placebo in patients with advanced HCC (25). In another 
randomized study of Asian patients with advanced HCC, 
sorafenib treatment led to a net survival gain of 2.3 months 
versus placebo (26). In the future, an active area of investiga￾tion will be the combination of TACE with these multi-targeted 
receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors.
