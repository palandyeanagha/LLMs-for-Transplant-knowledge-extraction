INTRODUCTION
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a
major health problem, highly prevalent
in the general population, and associated
with a high mortality rate mainly due to
cardiovascular complications (1). Several
animal models have been used to study
different features of CKD (2), and the use
of genetically engineered mice has
greatly expanded the utility of this
model in studying molecular mecha￾nisms underlying the renal response to
chronic insults (3). Specifically, unilateral
ureteral ligation (UUO) induces, after a
few hours, cellular infiltration into the
kidney, mainly macrophages that secrete
growth factors and cytokines that ulti￾mately induce disequilibrium between
apoptosis and proliferation of the tubular
cells, which favors fibroblast activation
and proliferation. Activated fibroblasts
secrete additional extracellular matrix
(ECM) components that accumulate in
the interstitium, and, as the obstruction
continues, ECM deposition becomes
massive, and the uncontrolled apoptosis
of cells results in tubular atrophy (3).
This matrix remodeling and cellular
stress can release molecules that finally
instigate an inflammatory response.
Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are an innate
family of receptors that can sense tissue

Inflammation contributes to the pathogenesis of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Molecules released by the inflamed injured tis￾sue can activate toll-like receptors (TLRs), thereby modulating macrophage and CD4+ T-cell activity. We propose that in renal fi￾brogenesis, M2 macrophages are recruited and activated in a T helper subset 2 cell (TH2)-prone inflammatory milieu in a MyD88-
dependent manner. Mice submitted to unilateral ureteral ligation (UUO) demonstrated an increase in macrophage infiltration with
collagen deposition after 7 d. Conversely, TLR2, TLR4 and MyD88 knockout (KO) mice had an improved renal function together with
diminished TH2 cytokine production and decreased fibrosis formation. Moreover, TLR2, TLR4 and MyD88 KO animals exhibited less M2
macrophage infiltration, namely interleukin (IL)-10+ and CD206+ CD11bhigh cells, at 7 d after surgery. We evaluated the role of a TH2
cytokine in this context, and observed that the absence of IL-4 was associated with better renal function, decreased IL-13 and TGF￾β levels, reduced arginase activity and a decrease in fibrosis formation when compared with IL-12 KO and wild-type (WT) animals.
Indeed, the better renal outcomes and the decreased fibrosis formation were restricted to the deficiency of IL-4 in the hematopoi￾etic compartment. Finally, macrophage depletion, rather than the absence of T cells, led to reduced lesions of the glomerular fil￾tration barrier and decreased collagen deposition. These results provide evidence that future therapeutic strategies against renal
fibrosis should be accompanied by the modulation of the M1:M2 and TH1:TH2 balance, as TH2 and M2 cells are predictive of fibro￾sis toward mechanisms that are sensed by innate immune response and triggered in a MyD88-dependent pathway.

damage and orchestrate a cascade of in￾flammation following obstruction. Re￾cent reports have shown reduced fibrosis
in TLR4-deficient mice in a renal (4) and
a hepatic (5) model of fibrotic diseases.
In addition, the obstructed kidneys of
TLR2-deficient mice demonstrated a de￾crease in the number of interstitial myo -
fibroblasts in the later phase of neph -
ropathy, even with no differences in
collagen deposition (6). TLR2 and TLR4
signal via the intracellular adaptor mole￾cule MyD88, although only a few studies
implicated a role for MyD88 in fibrosis
(7). TLRs modulate the immune system
through the production of different cy￾tokines, and influence the differentiation
of immune cells. In a lung model of
chronic disease, adaptive TH2 cell immu￾nity is essential to the promotion of fi￾brosis (8,9). In fact, cytokines are related
to the adaptive immune response out￾come in chronic inflammatory diseases,
whereas fibrosis is strongly linked to the
development of a TH2-biased response
(involving interleukin [IL]-4, IL-5 and 
IL-13) (10–12).
Macrophages are considered to play a
pivotal role in the development of renal
fibrosis (13,14). Recent studies raise the
possibility that the effector phenotype of
the recruited macrophages, rather than
their presence, determines the extent of
renal parenchymal injury (15,16). Macro￾phages are classified in distinct subpopu￾lations according to their response to in￾nate or adaptive immune signals. The
term “classically activated” has been
used to designate the effector macro￾phages that are produced during cell-
 mediated immune responses (17). Such
macrophages also are designated M1
macrophages and express iNOS, CXCL9,
CCR7, CXCL11, IL-12 and interferon
(IFN)-γ. On the other hand, one of the
first innate signals released during tissue
injury is thought to be IL-4, an inducer of
“alternatively activated” or M2 macro￾phages (18). Basophils and mast cells are
important early sources of innate IL-4
production, although other granulocytes
also might contribute (19). Besides IL-4,
IL-13 can induce arginase-1 and collagen
deposition (19,20). Imbalance in produc￾tion and catabolism of collagen, associ￾ated with prolonged IL-13 effects on
macrophages, promotes excessive fibro￾sis. M2 macrophages express CD206, 
IL-10, arginase-1, FIZZ-1, YM-1 and
RELM-α. One aspect to be elucidated is
to what extent TH2 cyto kines and M2
macrophages contribute to noninfectious
causes of fibrosis.
Since collagen deposition is a hallmark
of all chronic diseases, preceded by the
development of sterile inflammation
which can be modulated by the presence
of cytokines, here, we postulated that
MyD88-dependent pathways could be
involved in sensing these tissue alter￾ations and in favoring a TH2-prone profi￾brotic immune response.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animal Studies
Male TLR2, TLR4, MyD88, IL-4, IL-12
and Rag-1 knockout (KO) mice in H-2b
background and control C57Bl/6, aged 6
to 8 wks, were bred and housed in a
pathogen-free facility. They were kept on
a 12 h light:dark cycle in a temperature-
 controlled room at 21–23°C, with free
 access to water and food. Mice were
anesthetized with ketamine–xylazine
(Agribrands do Brazil, Sao Paulo,
Brazil). On d 0, UUO was performed by
complete ligation of the right ureter. For
each group, in a set of experiments, five
mice were subjected to UUO and five
used as sham mice. All procedures were
approved by the internal ethical commit￾tee of the University of Sao Paulo (no.
45/2009).
Renal Function Outcomes
Urinary protein:creatinine ratio was
measured in samples collected from the
obstructed pelvis and from the bladder at
7 d after surgery. All samples were ana￾lyzed by colorimetric assays using com￾mercially purchased kits for creatinine and
protein measurements (Labtest, Minas
Gerais, Brazil). The ratio was normalized
dividing the ratio at d 7 by the ratio before
surgery in each group of animals.
Fibrosis Quantification
Kidneys were collected in 10% buf -
fered formaldehyde for fixation. Sum￾marily, the slides were deparaffinized, re￾hydrated and immersed in saturated
picric acid solution for 15 min and then
in picrosirius for 20 more minutes. Coun￾terstaining was carried out with Harris
hematoxylin. Picrosirius-stained sections
were analyzed by an Olympus BX50 mi￾croscope with an Olympus camera at￾tached. Manual shots were taken of the
cortex, magnified 40×, and observed
under polarized light. Photos of at least
10 different fields in each slide were
taken, and structures such as the
glomeruli, subcapsular cortex, large ves￾sels and medulla were excluded. For the
morphometric analysis, the Image Pro￾cessing and Analysis portion in ImageJ
software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA;
http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/) was used.
The result of the analysis was repre￾sented by percentage, and refers to the
proportion of the volume to the total cor￾tical interstitial volume.
Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry was performed
using a microwave-based antigen re￾trieval technique. Previously, the slides
were deparaffinized, rehydrated and
submitted to Tris-EDTA, pH 9, antigen
retrieval solution at 95°C. The endoge￾nous peroxidase activity was blocked
with 3% hydrogen peroxide, and Protein
Block Solution (DAKO, Glostrup, Den￾mark) was added. The slides were incu￾bated with type I collagen (diluted 1:300;
Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) and
FSP-1 (diluted 1:600; A5114; DAKO, Ely,
UK) antibodies or a negative control
reagent, followed by incubation with the
labeled polymer (Dual Link System￾HRP; DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark) using
two sequential 30-min incubations at
room temperature. Staining was com￾pleted by performing a 1- to 3-min incu￾bation with 3,3-0-diaminobenzidine sub￾strate- chromogen, which results in a
brown-colored precipitate at the antigen
site. Hematoxylin counterstaining was
 performed.

MyD88 M2/T H 2 IMMUNE CELLS AND FIBROSIS DEVELOPMENT

Hydroxyproline Quantification
Aliquots of standard hydroxyproline
(Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) or kidney
samples were hydrolyzed in alkali. The
hydrolyzed samples then were mixed
with a buffered chloramines-T reagent,
and the oxidation was allowed to pro￾ceed for 25 min at room temperature.
The chromophore then was developed
with the addition of Ehrlich reagent and
the absorbance of reddish purple com￾plex was measured at 550 nm using a
spectrophotometer. Absorbance values
were plotted against the concentration of
standard hydroxyproline, and the pres￾ence of hydroxyproline was determined
using the standard curve (21).
Quantitative Real-Time
Total RNA was isolated from frozen
kidney tissue using the TRIzol Reagent
(Invitrogen; Life Technologies, Carlsbad,
CA, USA) and protocol according to In￾vitrogen. RNA concentrations were de￾termined by spectrophotometer readings
at absor bance 260 nm. First-strand
cDNAs were synthesized using the
MML-V reverse transcriptase (Promega,
Madison, WI, USA). Real-time poly￾merase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was per￾formed using the TaqMan real-time PCR
assay (Applied Biosystems, Life Tech￾nologies) for the following molecules:
HPRT (Mm01545399_m1), tumor necro￾sis factor (TNF)-α (Mm00443258_m1), 
TLR2 (Mm00442346_m1), 
TLR4 (Mm00445273_m1), 
MyD88 (Mm00440338_m1), 
GATA-3 (Mm01337569_m1), 
TBX21 (Mm00450960_m1), 
type 1 collagen (Mm00801666_g1), 
IL-4 (Mm00445259_m1), 
arginase 1 (Mm01190441_g1), 
TSLP (Mm00498739_m1), 
iNOS (Mm00440485_m1) and 
TGF-β (Mm03024053_m1). Cycling condi￾tions were as follows: 10 min at 95°C fol￾lowed by 45 cycles at 20 s each at 95°C,
20 s at 58°C, and 20 s at 72°C. Analysis
used Sequence Detection System (SDS)
software version 1.9.1 Applied Biosys￾tems, Life Technologies). mRNA expres￾sion was normalized to HPRT expression.
Flow Cytometry
Infiltrating cells were analyzed by
multicolor flow cytometry. The mono￾clonal antibodies used were F4/80
PerCP, CD11b PE, CD206 FITC, MIG PE,
IL-10 APC, p40 (IL-12/IL-23) PE, CD4
Pacific Blue, IL-4 PerCP, IFN-γ FITC (all
purchased from BD Biosciences,
Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). Samples
were acquired on a FACSCanto, using
FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences)
and then were analyzed with FlowJo
software (Tree Star, Ashland, OR, USA).
Fluorescence voltages were determined
using matched unstained cells. Two
hundred thousand events were acquired
in a live mononuclear gate, and the
compensation process was made accord￾ing to the “fluorescence minus one”
method.

Cytokines Determination by Enzyme￾Linked Immunosorbent Assay
Tissue protein lysates were prepared
by weighing frozen tissue and placing
the samples in an appropriate amount
of lysis buffer with protease inhibitors.
Protein concentrations were determined
using the Bradford protein assay
(Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA).
Total renal IL-13 (eBioscience, San
Diego, CA, USA) and TGFβ1 (TGFβ1
Emax ImmunoAssay Systems, Promega)
protein was measured according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The results
are presented as pg cytokine/mg of
total protein measured using the Brad￾ford assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA,
USA).
Arginase Activity
The kidney samples were homoge￾nized in lysis buffer and centrifuged for
30 min at 14000g at 4°C. Briefly, sam￾ples lysates were incubated with 10
mmol/L MnCl2 and 50 mmol/L Tris￾HCl (pH 7.5). The hydrolysis reaction of
L-arginine by arginase was performed
by incubating the mixture containing
activated arginase and was stopped by
adding acid solution. For calorimetric
determination of urea, α-isonitrosopro￾piophenone was added, and the mix￾ture was heated at 100°C for 45 min.
After placing the sample in the dark for
10 min at room temperature, the urea
concentration was determined spec￾trophotometrically by the absorbance at
550 nm.
Liposome Preparation and
Macrophage Depletion
Chlodronate (Bonefos, Schering, São
Paulo, Brazil) was entrapped in lipo￾somes by ether injection as described
previously (22). Typically, 0.5 mL of an
ether solution containing 50 mg phos￾phatidylcholine, and 8 mg cholesterol
was injected (0.2 mL/minute) into 5 mL
of a 50 mmol/L chlodronate aqueous
solution maintained at 42°C. The lipo￾some suspension was centrifuged at
22800g for 30 min (Hitachi Himac
CR20B2 centrifuge, Hitachi, Troy, MI,
USA) at 25°C. The liposome-containing
pellet was washed twice by centrifuga￾tion under the same conditions in NaCl
solution 0.9% (w/v). The final pellet
was resuspended in 2 mL of saline solu￾tion. Typically, the final phosphatidyl￾choline and chlodronate concentrations
in the liposomes were 10 mmol/L and
0.5 mmol/L, respectively. The yield of
entrapped clodronate was about 1% of
the initial quantity added. Mice were
injected intraperitoneally (IP) with 100
μL of liposome preparation (6 μg of clo￾dronate) 24 h before the UUO surgery.
In addition, 200 μL of liposome prepa￾ration (12 μg of clodronate), were ad￾ministered IP during surgery and 3 d
later.
Generation of BM Chimeric Mice
Male 6- to 8-wk-old IL-4 and IL-12
knockout (KO) mice were irradiated
(11 Gy total body irradiation during 
1,597 s). One h later, mice were reconsti￾tuted with 5 × 106 bone marrow (BM)
cells from either IL-12 or IL-4 KO male
donors. For the first 2 wks after BM
transplantation, mice received 0.2%
ciprofloxacin (Cip ronil; Farmabase,
Jaguariuna, Brazil) in their drinking

using analysis of variance (ANOVA)
(with Tukey post hoc test) and Student

RESULTS
TLR2, TLR4 and MyD88 are Involved in
Renal Fibrogenesis
Sterile inflammation and cell death are
present during remodeling of ECM in ex￾perimental models of CKD. Interestingly,
such processes can release molecules that
ultimately could be recognized by innate
immune receptors in infiltrating cells and
throughout the nephron (23). Thus, we
initially investigated the expression of
TLR2, TLR4 and MyD88 molecules in
wild-type (WT) mice subjected to urine
flow obstruction (Figures 1A–C). Since
we observed an enhanced expression of
those innate immune receptors, we next
questioned whether they could be in￾volved in renal disease progression.
When subjected to UUO, all animals
demonstrated a reduced proteinuria (Fig￾ure 1D), less deposition, protein and
mRNA expression of type 1 collagen and
lower infiltration of FSP1-positive cells as
compared with WT mice (Figure 1E–I).
UUO also enhances hydroxyproline
quantity, the main amino acid that con￾stitutes collagen (24). In this sense, TLR2,
TLR4 and MyD88 KO mice presented de￾creased hydroxyproline rate (Figure 1J)
compared with the WT mice. Altogether,
our data demonstrate that TLRs partici￾pate in renal fibrosis.
MyD88 Signaling Favors a TH2 Pattern
after UUO
Past studies have associated TLRs with
the TH2 immune response. In a pul￾monary model of chronic disease, TLR4
polarized toward a TH2 response by mod￾ulating dendritic cells (DCs) in both
hematopoietic and stromal compartments
(25). Thus, using our UUO model, we in￾vestigated whether the MyD88 pathway
was involved in renal fibrosis by favoring
a TH2-biased response. As shown in Fig￾ures 2A and 2B, UUO led to increased
mRNA levels of IL-4 and IFN-γ. Thus, we
examined the GATA3:Tbet ratio. Indeed,
this ratio was lower in TLR2 and MyD88
KO mice. Additionally, arginase-1,
GATA3, TSLP and Fizz-1 mRNA, all TH2
pattern-related molecules, were downreg￾ulated in MyD88 KO mice (Figures 2D–G).
However, there were no differences in
TBX21, TNF-α, iNOS and IL-6 mRNA in
TLR2, TLR4 and MyD88 KO compared
with WT mice (Figures 2H–K). We also
investigated MCP-1 mRNA in such ani￾mals, as shown in Figure 2L. TLR2- and
MyD88-deficient animals present de￾creased expression of MCP-1 mRNA
when compared with WT mice.
To confirm these results, we evaluated
the percentage of kidney-infiltrating cells
expressing TH1:TH2- and M1:M2-related
molecules in those animals. The gate strat￾egy to analyze cells is showed in Supple￾mentary Figure S1. As expected, MyD88
KO mice showed a decreased percentage
of IL-4+
CD4+ cells (Figure 3A). However,
the percentage of IFN-γ
+
CD4+ did not
change among all KO animals when com￾pared with WT mice (Figure 3B). Then, we
examined the IL-4/ IFN-γ ratio, and we ob￾served that MyD88 KO mice have the low￾est ratio (Fig ure 3C). Considering the infil￾tration of myeloid cells, MyD88 KO

animals showed a decreased percentage of
CD11bhigh and CD11blow cells (Fig ures 3D,
E). On the other hand, the percentage of
CD11bhigh cells expressing CCR7, an M1
marker, was increased in MyD88 KO ani￾mals (Figure 3F). CD11bhigh cells express￾ing CD206 and IL-10, both M2 markers,
were diminished in MyD88 KO, when
compared with WT animals (Figures 3G,
H). The percentage of CD11bhigh cells ex￾pressing IL-12 (p40) and MIG was equal
among all groups (Figures 3I, J). Alto￾gether, these data suggested that TLR2,
TLR4 and MyD88 KO mice are protected
against fibrosis through impairment in
mounting a TH2 immune response and by
favoring a M1 phenotype. This profile was
more prominent in MyD88 KO animals.
Involvement of the TH2-Driven Immune
Response in Fibrosis
Our data suggest that a TH2-biased im￾mune response was associated with renal
fibrosis. Thus, we investigated whether
an impaired TH2 immune condition
would protect mice against UUO. First,
we observed that IL-4 KO mice subjected
to urine flow obstruction did not increase
the production of IL-13 after UUO as WT
and IL-12 KO mice did (Figure 4A). Our
results also showed that IL-4 KO animals
have diminished mRNA and protein
TGF-β expression (Figures 4B, C). Fur￾thermore, IL-4 KO mice showed de￾creased arginase-1 activity when com￾pared with IL-12 KO mice (Figure 4D).
Indeed, IL-4 KO animals showed in￾creased infiltration of MIG+
CD11bhigh
cells (Figure 4E), whereas IL-12 KO ani￾mals showed increased infiltration of
CD206+
CD11bhigh cells in obstructed kid￾neys (Figure 4F). Despite physical dam￾age caused by ureteral obstruction, IL-4
KO mice had decreased proteinuria (Fig￾ure 5A). IL-4- deficient mice also showed
a decrease in hydroxyproline rate and in
type 1 collagen mRNA (Figures 5B, C)
when compared with controls. These data
corroborated Sirius red staining analysis
of renal tissue, where an increase in colla￾gen deposition in IL-12 KO mice was sig￾nificantly higher than those seen in IL-4
KO and WT mice (Figures 5D, E). Our

data confirmed the participation of the
TH2-related cytokines in the development
of fibrosis by different mechanisms.
Hematopoietic Source of TH2-Related
Cytokine and Macrophages Are
Responsible for Fibrosis Development
The microenvironment can modulate
the immune response and thus interfere
in macrophage and CD4 + T-cell activa￾tion. To determine whether the reduced
fibrosis observed in obstructed IL-4 KO
mice was due to IL-4 deficiency in
parenchyma cells or in infiltrating leuko￾cytes, we performed bone marrow (BM)
chimera studies. Irradiated IL-12 KO
mice were reconstituted with IL-4 KO
BM, whereas irradiated IL-4 KO mice
were reconstituted with IL-12 KO BM. As
shown in Figure 6A, chimeric IL-12 to 
IL-4 KO animals had better renal out￾comes, which were reflected by de￾creased proteinuria and a diminished fi￾brotic area (Figures 6B, C). In contrast,
chimeric IL-4 to IL-12 KO animals had
worse renal function.
To analyze the role of macrophages
and T cells in development of renal fibro￾sis, we used clodronate liposomes to de￾plete macrophages (Supplementary Fig￾ure S2), and T-cell-deficient mice,
respectively. Macrophages play a pivotal
role in the development of tubular apo￾ptosis and renal fibrosis (13,26). Clo￾dronate administration led to better renal
function (Figure 7A) and to a decreased
renal fibrotic area (Figure 7B, C). In con￾trast, the absence of T cells did not
change the proteinuria: creatininuria ratio
or collagen deposition. These data con￾firm that macrophages influence fibrosis
development in an UUO system.
DISCUSSION
Renal fibrosis is the result of an injury
that leads to the production of ECM
compounds. Because the obstruction is
continuous, ECM deposition becomes
massive, and the uncontrolled apoptosis
of tubular cells results in tubular atro￾phy (4). This matrix remodeling and cel￾lular stress release molecules that ulti￾mately activate an inflammatory
response through innate sensing recep￾tors. Some groups have demonstrated
the importance of TLRs in chronic kid￾ney injuries (5,7). TLR2, TLR4 and
MyD88 are able to sense signals that ul￾timately lead to extracellular matrix
deposition. We know TLR2 and TLR4-
deficient animals present less fibrotic￾associated process (4–6), however, it
was unclear, until now, how the stimu￾lation of such innate immune receptors
can lead to fibrogenesis. Indeed, it has
been proposed that TH2 cytokines are
implicated in fibrosis formation in lung
and hepatic models of chronic diseases
(10–12). Thus, we hypothesize that the
signaling pathway of TLRs led to renal
fibrosis development due to a polariza￾tion toward a TH2/M2-biased pheno￾type. Using an established experimental
model of renal fibrosis, we observed
that the absence of MyD88 signaling
culminated in a decreased TH2/ M2-
 related profile and protection against
renal fibrosis formation.
We explored the role of MyD88-
 mediated innate immunity and the
TH2/M2 immune deviated response, by
investigating the TH1:TH2 and M1:M2 bal￾ance in our model of disease. WT animals
exhibited a TH2 pattern following ureteral
obstruction, whereas TLR2, TLR4 and
MyD88 KO mice did not. In addition, we
observed an increase in TH1-related cy￾tokines in WT mice, but assumed that the
increase in TH2-related cytokines had bio￾logical relevancy in a profibrotic environ￾ment. Additionally, the decreased levels
of TGF-β, IL-13, IL-4, GATA-3, TSLP and
arginase-1 activity observed in the defi￾cient mice corroborated our hypothesis.
IL-13, a TH2 cytokine, promotes collagen
production by distinct but overlapping
mechanisms (27). IL-13 stimulates the
production of latent TGF-β by macro￾phages, directly activates the collagen￾producing machinery in fibroblasts and
promotes the activation of alternative
macrophages by upregulating arginase-1
activity (28). Members of the TGF-β su￾RESEARCH ARTICLE

perfamily are the most extensively stud￾ied macrophage-derived growth factors
that have been linked to renal fibrosis.
This cytokine is a potent chemoattractant
for macrophage/monocyte cells and can
induce myofibroblast transformation via
epithelial- or endothelial-to-mesenchymal
transitions (29). In our model, the expres￾sion of IL-13 and TGF-β was present in
all mice with increased collagen deposi￾tion. Finally, TSLP, which was reduced in
TLR2-, TLR4- and MyD88-deficient ani￾mals, is described as effective for the dif￾ferentiation of CD4+ TH2 cells. The combi￾nation of TCR stimulation and TSLP
signaling induce IL-4 transcription and
further TH2 polarization (30). Therefore,
the decreased levels of these TH2- related
products observed in protected mice
leads to the conclusion that ureteral ob￾struction induces fibrosis development in
a manner dependent on the TH2 immune
response.
Finally, to determine the source of the
TH2-related cells, we investigated the
contribution of infiltrating hematopoietic
and/or resident parenchymal cells in fi￾brosis formation. We performed chimeric
experiments and observed that recipient
IL-12 KO animals from IL-4 bone marrow
KO mice demonstrated better renal func￾tion and decreased collagen deposition,
which suggests a dependency of IL-4
from hematopoietic cells to generate fi￾brosis. T lymphocytes and macrophages
are included in such hematopoietic cells,
but the role of T lymphocytes in fibrosis
formation is controversial. Tapmeier et al.
stated CD4+ T cells have a pivotal role in
ureteric obstruction (31). However, this
group found no difference in tubular
damage, in the number of F4/80+ macro￾phages and TGF-β mRNA expression
when comparing Rag-1 KO and WT
mice, which leads us to argue that the re￾duction in Masson trichrome in Rag-1
KO mice could be the result of a less
profibrotic phenotype in the macrophage
infiltrate. Otherwise, Shappell et al.
demonstrated that the absence of T cells
does not change the tubular atrophy and
interstitial volume expansion when com￾pared with mice with T cells in a model
of obstructive nephropathy (32). Our
data corroborate Shappell’s study, indi￾cating the fibrotic response is an indirect
consequence of T cell-mediated renal in￾jury, rather than T cells being directly in￾volved in fibrosis. It seems T cells influ￾ence macrophage function and collagen
deposition by fibroblasts.
Macrophage infiltration of the kidney
is a prominent feature associated with
the severity of renal injury and progres￾sive renal failure (15). Several groups
have shown that systemic depletion of
phagocytes with liposomal clodronate in
different immune-mediated renal injury
models reduces morphologic kidney
damage (26,27,33). However, recent stud￾ies raise the possibility that the effector
phenotype of the recruited macrophages,
rather than their presence, determines
the extent of renal parenchymal injury
(34,35). Wang and colleagues demon￾strated that M1 infusion leads to worse
kidney parameters in a proinflammatory
model of renal disease (15). The presence
of proinflammatory macrophages in in￾jured organs has been shown to increase
the generation of reactive oxygen species
(ROS) and to induce the death of injured
tubular cells (36). Additionally, the popu￾lation of M2 macrophages increases
when cell proliferation occurs, mainly in
chronic models of injured kidney. Lee et
al. demonstrated that M1 macrophages
decrease iNOS expression and increase
M2 markers in contact with proximal
tubule cells either in an in vitro system or
with the injury becoming chronic in vivo
(34). However, more studies must be
conducted to clarify to what extent dif￾ferent macrophage subpopulations are
attracted to the kidney or to what extent
a single cell is able to cause damage or to
regulate the scar process. Based on the
wound healing process, Anders et al. pro￾posed four different types of macro￾phages: M1 macrophages induced by
renal infection and cell necrosis; M2c/
suppressor macrophages induced by up￾take of apoptotic cells; M2a/wound heal￾ing macrophages induced by abundant
growth factor secretion; and fibrolytic
macrophages, able to solve the scar pro￾cess (37). In the present study, we investi￾1238 | BRAGA ET AL. | MOL MED 18:1231-1239, 2012

gated the presence of M1 and M2a
macrophages, and we found a decreased
number of M2a macrophages in TLR2,
TLR4, MyD88 and IL-4 KO mice that, ul￾timately, presented less fibrosis.
CONCLUSION
Therefore, we propose that a urinary
obstruction flow model generates the re￾cruitment and the activation of M2 macro￾phages as well as the stimulation of a TH2
immune response, in a MyD88-dependent
manner. This process culminates in extra￾cellular matrix deposition and fibrosis for￾mation (Supplementary Figure S3). Taken
together, these results provide evidence
that future therapeutic strategies against
renal fibrosis should be accompanied by
the modulation of the M1:M2 and TH1:TH2
balance and this control appears to be es￾sential in chronic kidney disease, making
TH2 and M2 cells predictive of fibrosis.
