Background: Macroscopic vascular invasion (MVI) commonly occurs in patients with
advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) for which resection and sorafenib are the
common therapies prescribed. Here, we aimed to compare the survival outcomes of
these two therapies in HCC patients with MVI.
Methods: In total, 496 patients diagnosed with HCC and MVI without extrahepatic
metastasis, treated with resection (resection-based group, n = 388) and sorafenib
(sorafenib-based group, n = 108) were included in this study. A one-to-one
propensity score-matching analysis (PSM) was performed to minimize the effect of
potential confounders.
Results: The median OS in the resection- and sorafenib-based group was 20.7 months
(95% CI: 16.9–24.5) and 11.6 months (95% CI: 8.4–14.9) (p < 0.001), respectively. The
median PFS was 4.7 months (95% CI: 3.8–5.5) in the resection-based group and 4.4
months (95% CI: 3.6–5.2) in the sorafenib-based group (p < 0.001). After PSM, 72
patients from each group were matched. The median OS was 27.2 months (95% CI:
16.4–38.0) in the resection-based group and 13.0 months (95% CI: 9.6–16.3) in the
sorafenib-based group (p < 0.001). The median PFS was 5.3 months (95% CI: 3.2–7.4)
in the resection-based group and 4.8 months (95% CI: 3.6–6.0) in the sorafenib-based
group (p = 0.061).
Conclusion: Findings from this study showed that, compared with sorafenib-based
treatment, surgical resection might be associated with better survival benefits to HCC
patients with MVI.

Mei et al. Resection vs. Sorafenib for Advanced HCC
INTRODUCTION
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common
malignancies, and the fourth leading cause of cancer-related
deaths worldwide (1). Because of its concealed onset, HCC often
progresses to macroscopic vascular invasion (MVI) at the time
of diagnosis (2). Before new targeted drugs such as lenvatinib
and immune checkpoint inhibitors were available, the first-line
of treatment for HCC patients with MVI recommended by
the Barcelona guideline was systemic therapy with sorafenib
(3) and had a median overall survival (mOS) ranging from
5.6 to 8.1 months (4, 5). However, in the Asia-Pacific region,
some patients with MVI, especially those without extrahepatic
metastases, could still benefit from survival through resection,
with mOS ranging from 8.9 to 33 months (6–11). Therefore, the
optimal choice between the two therapies for HCC patients with
MVI was controversal.
To date, only a few studies have investigated the prognosis
of surgical resection in comparison to sorafenib in HCC
patients with MVI and inconsistent results have been reported,
possibly, due to imbalanced patients characteristics between the
investigated cohorts and a limited number of enrolled patients (8,
12). Nowadays, the vast majority of patients with MVI were not
in the initial treatment state when receiving surgery or sorafenib.
Late-stage HCC patients are referred to combined therapies,
instead of surgery or sorafenib alone. Therefore, relevant clinical
researches were valuable.
The purpose of this study was to compare the prognoses
of HCC patients with MVI undergoing surgical resection and
sorafenib, aiming to provide a reference for the treatment of
advanced HCC patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This study was conducted according to the ethical guidelines of
the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki. The analysis of the patient data
was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board
and Human Ethics Committee at the Sun Yat-sen University
Cancer Center (SYSUCC; Guangzhou, China).
Patients
The medical records of patients diagnosed with HCC and
MVI without extrahepatic metastasis who underwent surgical
resection or were prescribed sorafenib as part of standard therapy
at the Department of Liver Surgery (SYSUCC), between 2005
and 2017, were reviewed for eligibility. Some patients were
excluded based on the following criteria: (a) diagnosed with
malignant diseases other than HCC; (b) aged >80 or <18; (c)
had a performance status score >1; (d) had incomplete follow￾up or medical information; (e) had sorafenib treatment for <2
months. Those who first received surgical resection treatment
were classified into a resection-based group, while those who
first received sorafenib-based treatment were classified into a
sorafenib-based group. The patient enrolment and categorization
flow chart is shown in Figure 1. All laboratory serum test
data was collected within 3 days before treatment (resection
or sorafenib). Preoperative imaging examinations included
contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) or magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) within a week before treatment.
Treatment Procedure
Hepatic resection was performed as previously described (13).
Intraoperative ultrasound was routinely performed to evaluate
the tumor burden, remnant liver, and possibility of a negative
resection margin. Anatomic hepatectomy with mass tumor
thrombectomy was the preferred method of liver resection.
Depending on its location and extent, the tumor thrombus
was removed by en-bloc resected with the tumor tissue
or extracted from the lumen of the blood vessel. Tumor
thrombus was confirmed by rinsing with normal saline, and
the absence of tumor thrombus formation was confirmed by
intraoperative ultrasound.
Sorafenib (Bayer, Leverkusen, Germany) was initially orally
administered 200 or 400 mg twice daily and continued for at least
2 months. Withdrawal and reduction of the drug depended on
unacceptable toxicities or untreatable disease progression.
The final follow-up ended on July 31, 2019. Enhanced CT
or MRI was performed every 2 or 3 months after surgery or
sorafenib according to subsequent therapies. Follow-ups were
performed as previously described (14), unless judged otherwise
by the treating physicians.
Diagnosis and Definitions
The diagnosis of MVI was based on standard radiological
imaging prior to treatment (resection or sorafenib prescription)
(15, 16). Portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) was graded
according to the classification suggested by the Liver Cancer
Study Group of Japan (17). Based on liver vessel structure and
prognosis for different location of vascular tumor thrombus
(18), we combined hepatic vein tumor thrombus (HVTT)
into PVTT classification, based on which, Vp1 represented
the invasion of a third-order branch or distal to the second
branch of the portal vein; Vp2, invasion of a second-order
branch of the portal vein, or branch of the hepatic vein;
Vp3, invasion of in the first branch of the portal vein, or
hepatic vein trunk or the short hepatic vein; Vp4, invasion
of the main trunk/controlateral branch of the portal vein,
or inferior vena cava. Overall survival (OS) was defined
as the time interval from treatment initiation to cancer￾related death. Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined
as the time interval from treatment initiation to tumor
progression. For the resection-based group, tumor progression
was defined as intrahepatic recurrence or new intrahepatic or
extrahepatic lesions developed. For the sorafenib-based group,
progression was defined as progressive disease (PD) according
to the modified response evaluation criteria in solid tumors
(mRECIST) (19), progressive intrahepatic tumor thrombus or
extrahepatic metastasis.
Statistical Analysis
Categorical variables in baseline characteristics were compared
using the Pearson’s χ
2
test or Fisher’s exact test. To minimize
the influence of selection bias produced by preoperative factors
between the two groups, propensity score matching (PSM)

was conducted using a logistic regression model (20, 21).
Pre-treatment variables were entered into the PSM, comprising
of age (≤/>50 years old), gender (male/female), hepatitis B
surface antigen DNA (HBs DNA) (≤103/>103), liver cirrhosis
(None or mild/Moderate or severe), aspartate aminotransferase
(AST) (≤50/>50 U/L), albumin (ALB) (≤40/>40 g/L), total
bilirubin (TBIL) (≤20.5/>20.5 µmol/L), prothrombin time
(PT) (≤13.5/>13.5 s), Child-Pugh score (5/>5), tumor number
(1/>1), largest nodule (<5/5-10/>10 cm), distribution (Uni￾lobar/Bi-lobar), tumor thrombus (Vp1/2/3/4). PSM was
performed by a 1:1 matching method with a caliper width of
0.1. Survival analyses were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier
method and differences in survival curves were analyzed using
the log-rank test. All variables with a P < 0.1 in univariate
analyses were used in multivariate analyses using the Cox’s
proportional hazards models. The hazard ratio (HR) and
confidence intervals (CI) were also calculated. A value of
two-tailed P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
All data analyses were performed using SPSS 25.0 software
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) and GraphPad Prism (version 8.0;
GraphPad, Inc.).
RESULTS
Identification of Study Patients
From 2005 to 2017, 488 patients with HCC who underwent
surgical resection (n = 388) or sorafenib (n = 108)
treatment after a diagnosis of MVI without extrahepatic
metastasis were identified. Of note, all patients in the
sorafenib-based group were treated since January 2009
because sorafenib was available only from that year. In
the resection-based group, 88 (22.7%) patients underwent
surgical resection before January 2009 and the rest after
January 2009.

Characteristics of the Study Patients
Between 2005 and 2017, 691 patients were reviewed for eligibility
and 496 patients were ultimately included in this study (388 in
resection-based group, 108 in sorafenib-based group).
The clinical pre-treatment characteristics of the patients in the
resection-based and sorafenib-based groups are summarized in
Table 1. In general, patients who underwent surgical resection
had smaller tumor burden and better liver function. In the
resection-based group, a smaller proportion of patients had
severer liver cirrhosis (51.0 vs. 78.7%, p < 0.001), higher child￾pugh score (11.3 vs. 24.1%, p < 0.001), higher AST (61.1
vs. 75.0%, p = 0.008), and higher TBIL (13.7 vs. 28.7, p <
0.001), as compared to the sorafenib-based group. Meanwhile,
larger proportion of patients in the sorafenib-based group were
with multiple (67.6 vs. 32.2%, p < 0.001) or bilateral tumors
(50.9 vs. 9.5%, p < 0.001), and had higher tumor thrombus
grade (Vp3 and Vp4, 90.8 vs. 65.7%, p < 0.001). 313(80.7%)
patients received surgical resection as their first treatment in the
resection-based group, while only 40 (37.0%) patients were first
treated with sorafenib in sorafenib-based treatment. In this study,
25 (6.6%) patients received subsequent sorafenib treatment in

the resection-based group, while 3 (2.8%) patients chose surgical
resection afterward in the sorafenib-based group.
After a 1:1 PSM, 72 pairs of patients were selected. The
basic clinical characteristics between the two groups were almost
consistent (Table 2). Initially treated patients still differed, for
50 (69.4%) in the resection-based group and 20 (27.8%) in the
sorafenib-based group. As for additional treatments, 4 patients
received sorafenib after surgery and 3 patients received surgical
resection after sorafenib treatment.
Overall Survival Analysis
Before PSM, the median OS was 20.7 months (95% CI: 16.9–
24.5) in the resection-based group and 11.6 months (95% CI:
8.4–14.9) in the sorafenib-based group (p < 0.001). The median
PFS was 4.7 months (95% CI: 3.8–5.5) in the resection-based
group and 4.4 months (95% CI: 3.6–5.2) in the sorafenib-based
group (p < 0.001). The 6-, 12-, and 24-month OS rates in the
resection-based group were 74.0, 55.0, and 33.9%, respectively,
and in the sorafenib-based group they were 71.3, 45.4, and
13.0%, respectively. The 6-, 12-, and 24-month PFS rates in the
resection-based group were 41.8, 28.4, and 20.5%, respectively,
Frontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org 5 May 2020 | Volume 10 | Article 573

Mei et al. Resection vs. Sorafenib for Advanced HCC
and in the sorafenib-based group they were 33.3, 13.0, and 3.7%,
respectively. Survival graphs of the different groups of patients
are shown in Figure 2.
Survival Analysis in the Matching Cohort
After PSM, the median OS was 27.2 months (95% CI: 16.4–
38.0) in the resection-based group and 13.0 months (95% CI:
9.6–16.3) in the sorafenib-based group (p < 0.001). The median
PFS was 5.3 months (95% CI: 3.2–7.4) in the resection-based
group and 4.8 months (95% CI: 3.6–6.0) in the sorafenib-based
group (p = 0.061). The 6-, 12-, and 24-month OS rates in the
resection-based group were 80.6, 56.9, and 25.0%, respectively,
and in the sorafenib-based group, they were 72.2, 47.2, and
15.3%, respectively. The 6-, 12-, and 24-month PFS rates in the
resection-based group were 48.6, 26.4, and 11.1%, respectively,
and in the sorafenib-based group, they were 38.9, 13.9, and
5.6%, respectively. Survival graphs are shown in Figure 3.
Forest plot analyses of factors associated with OS showed that
resection provided a superior clinical benefit in most pre-planned
subgroups except in female patients and those with tumor size
<5 cm and Vp4 thrombus (Figure 4), as compared to sorafenib.
ForPFS, resection only benefited patients with a single tumor
(Figure S1).
Prognostic Factors Analysis of Matched
Patients
The risk factors for OS and PFS were analyzed in the matched
cohorts (Tables S1, S2). Multivariate analyses identified male
(HR = 4.199, 95% CI: 1.023–17.234, p = 0.046), patients with
ALB > 40 g/L (HR = 0.563, 95% CI: 0.357–0.889, p = 0.014),
and sorafenib-based treatment (HR = 2.310, 95% CI: 1.481–

= 0.063) was a unique factor for RFS in both the univariate and
multivariate analysis.
Progression Analysis of Matched Patients
The position of assessable tumor progression was analyzed in
the matched cohorts (Table S3). Patients treated with sorafenib
tended to have more intrahepatic progression (91.2 vs. 68.5%, p
= 0.003). However, there was no statistically significant difference
for extrahepatic progression between patients who underwent
resection and sorafenib treatment (40.7 vs. 26.3%, p = 0.107).
Survival Analysis of Confounding Factors
Due to the actual treatment, the proportion of initial treated
patients in the two groups was inconsistent. Thus, we further
explore the prognosis of primary and non-primary patients in the
two groups. Patients who underwent non-primary resection had
better OS (mOS, 34.0 vs. 18.2 months, p = 0.005) but similar PFS
(mPFS, 4.1 vs. 4.8 months, p = 0.885) as compared to those who
received primary resection (Figure S2). No significant survival
difference was found between patients received primary and non￾primary sorafenib treatment (mOS, 13.6 vs. 10.1 months, p =
0.565; mPFS, 5.0 vs. 3.9 months, p = 0.407; Figure S3). In the
resection-based group, 25 patients were treated with sorafenib
after surgical resection and our findings showed that they had
no superior OS or PFS (mOS, 24.1 vs. 20.7 months, p = 0.900;
mPFS, 3.7 vs. 4.7 months, p = 0.077) than those who did not take
sorafenib during the follow-up treatment (Figure S4).
DISCUSSION
At present, the optimal therapy for advanced HCC remained
uncertain. Although most European guidelines recommend
targeted therapy as the first-line therapy, there were still a large
number of studies confirming that surgery could bring survival
benefit (6–8, 17, 22). Our study proved that in the real world,
Frontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org 7 May 2020 | Volume 10 | Article 573

Mei et al. Resection vs. Sorafenib for Advanced HCC
for some selected patients with good liver function and low
tumor burden, surgical resection could have significant benefits
of survival and disease control. After PSM, in the two groups of
patients with similar baseline levels, surgery was still associated
with significant increase in OS.
To our knowledge, there are currently a few studies comparing
the efficacy of surgery with sorafenib. Costentin CE reported that
OS of patients with HCC and MVI undergoing surgical resection
was similar to that treated with sorafenib in a multicenter
retrospective study, but the tumor states of patients after
matching were not consistent and the result was based on a
small sample of patients (46 patients vs. 39 patients) (12). Lee
et al. and Wang et al. suggested that surgery offered more
survival benefits to advanced HCC patients than other treatments
including sorafenib and TACE (8, 23). Kokudo et al. reported
their results of surgery in a large cohort of more than 2,000
HCC patients with PVTT (17). The mOS in the resection group
was 0.88 years longer than that in the non-resection group (2.45
vs. 1.57 years) in a propensity score-matched cohort. However,
sorafenib was not included in the non-surgical treatments.
This study included initially treated and non-initially treated
HCC patients with MVI. In our study, there were more initially
treated patients who received resection than those who received
sorafenib, which was in line with the actual treatment process for
HCC patients in the Asia-Pacific region. In the sorafenib-based
group, initially or non-initially treatment had no effect on OS and
PFS. Several researchers indicated that proper therapies prior to
sorafenib led to better survival outcomes for HCC patients (24,
25). It implied that in the treatment strategy of advanced HCC,
multiple combinations of locoreginal and systemic modalities
treatment could be applied, which may have a beneficial
therapeutic impact. For the resection-based group, patients who
received non-first-line resection had better prognosis. This might
suggest that those patients who could undergo surgery could
benefit from preoperative neoadjuvant therapies.
Multivariate analysis showed that indicators of liver function
seemed to have a greater impact on prognosis than tumor burden,
distribution, and tumor thrombus levels. It was confirmed by
other researches that attention should be not only paid to tumor￾related conditions, but also to the liver function of patients
(26, 27).
The results of subgroup analyses showed that almost all
subgroups of patients could have greater overall survival benefits
from surgery, except for female patients. This was possibly
due to the limited number of identifiable and enrollable cases.
Patients with all tumor thrombus levels except Vp4 could
benefit from surgery and therefore, systemic therapy would be
recommendable for advanced patients with PVTT reaching the
main portal vein or HVTT reaching the inferior vena cava. It
was confusing that patients with tumor size within 5 centimeters
had not a significant OS benefit from surgical resection. Given
the relatively small number of patients with small tumors in the
analyzed two groups (resection vs. sorafenib, 17 vs. 16), it might
accidentally cause statistical bias. The wide range of CI (0.25–
1.61) indicated the poor sample representation, which probably
could not reveal a true clinical phenomenon. Thus, more cases
needed to be accumulated to confirm this part of the issue.
In this study, 25 patients received sorafenib after surgery but
their prognosis (mOS, 24.1 months, mPFS, 3.7 months) was not
significantly different from those who did not take post-operative
sorafenib. Bruix Jordi’s phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled
study showed sorafenib is not an effective intervention in the
adjuvant setting for HCC following resection or ablation (28). So,
the application of post-operative sorafenib was controversial.
To note, the characteristics showed that patients with a higher
tumor burden and more severe liver pathology were given
sorafenib-based treatment. This was also reflected by the result
that sorafenib-treatment as a negative prognostic factor for this
group of patients. So resection shall be given careful evaluation
for advanced HCC patients.
This study had some limitations. First, this was a retrospective
study and although PSM was applied, there may still be some
inevitable selection biases. Second, due to multidisciplinary
comprehensive treatment strategy for HCC with MVI, patients
included in this study had strong heterogeneity. The final
result could not get rid of the influence of confounding factors
including previous, concomitant and subsequent treatment
after surgery and sorafenib. In addition, after the PSM,
the number of cases was relatively small. Findings from
this study should be further expanded to multicenter to
obtain higher-level medical evidence. Besides, it was worth
noting that the analyzed patients were coming from an Asia￾Pacific region which was known to have a high incidence
of hepatitis B virus (HBV) associated HCCs. Given the
high prevalence of HBV associated HCC in Caucasians,
Hong Kong Liver Cancer (HKLC) score could be operation￾prone due to a better stratification for these patients, where
BCLC score might be conservative and unbefitting (29, 30).
To better manage the treatment for patients with advanced
HCC, especially in Caucasian, HKLC score was expected
to applied.
In conclusion, our study indicated that, compared with
sorafenib, surgical resection might be associated with better
survival benefits in resectable HCC patients with MVI and
adequate liver function, and should be considered as an
important reliable therapy.
