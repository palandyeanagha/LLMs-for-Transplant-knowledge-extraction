Tumour-associated angiogenesis is partly regulated by the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway. Endocrine tumours are highly
vascularised and the molecular mechanisms of their angiogenesis are not fully delineated. The aim of this study is to evaluate
angiogenesis and expression of HIF-related molecules in a series of patients with pancreatic endocrine tumours (PETs). The
expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), HIF-1a, HIF-2a and carbonic anhydrase 9 (CA9) was examined by
immunohistochemistry in 45 patients with PETs and compared to microvascular density (MVD), endothelial proliferation, tumour
stage and survival. Microvascular density was very high in PETs and associated with a low endothelial index of proliferation.
Microvascular density was significantly higher in benign PETs than in PETs of uncertain prognosis, well-differentiated and poorly
differentiated carcinomas (mean values: 535, 436, 252 and 45 vessels mm2
, respectively, Po0.0001). Well-differentiated tumours
had high cytoplasmic VEGF and HIF-1a expression. Poorly differentiated carcinomas were associated with nuclear HIF-1a and
membranous CA9 expression. Low MVD (P ¼ 0.0001) and membranous CA9 expression (P ¼ 0.0004) were associated with a
poorer survival. Contrary to other types of cancer, PETs are highly vascularised, but poorly angiogenic tumours. As they progress,
VEGF expression is lost and MVD significantly decreases. The regulation of HIF signalling appears to be specific in pancreatic
endocrine tumours.

Tumorigenesis is critically dependent on the development of a
vascular supply and the regulators of blood vessel growth have
been shown to play a coordinated role in the progression of a
variety of tumours (Bergers and Benjamin, 2003). Normal
endocrine tissues and endocrine-derived tumours are character￾istically highly vascular and possess a dense and specialised
permeable microvascular endothelium. Endocrine cells overpro￾duce the angiogenic peptide vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF), which is likely to play an important role in the angiogenic
process associated with endocrine tumorigenesis (Christofori et al,
1995; Terris et al, 1998; Katoh, 2003). Moreover, they also express
specific endothelial cell mitogens, such as endocrine-gland-derived
VEGF, (EG-VEGF) that may function in a complementary manner
(LeCouter et al, 2001). However, the local and highly specific
mechanisms acting to regulate the angiogenic process associated
with endocrine tumorigenesis are poorly understood.
Hypoxia and the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) pathway
regulate the expression of a diverse group of genes that promote
tumour growth and are involved in tissue invasion, angiogenesis,
cell proliferation, glycolysis and pH regulation (Semenza, 2001;
Wykoff et al, 2001; Harris, 2002; Maxwell and Ratcliffe, 2002; Pugh
and Ratcliffe, 2003). Under normal conditions, the HIF-1a subunit
is hydroxylated by proline hydroxylase in a reaction requiring
oxygen, undergoes ubiquitination by the von Hippel-Lindau
(VHL) protein and is then rapidly degraded in the proteosome.
Under conditions of hypoxia in many cancers, HIF-1a cannot be
degraded and increases in the nucleus, leading to the upregulation
of many hypoxia-response proteins, such as VEGF or EG-VEGF
and carbonic anhydrase 9 (CA9) (Pastorekova et al, 1992; Opavsky
et al, 1996; Wykoff et al, 2000; Loncaster et al, 2001; Hui et al,
2002). The Hif-2a subunit shows properties similar to Hif-1a, but
is mainly expressed in the stromal macrophages, and may mediate
a different response to hypoxia (Talks et al, 2000). The HIF-1
pathway can also be activated in the VHL syndrome as a

consequence of somatic VHL gene inactivation (Kaelin, 2002).
Pancreatic endocrine tumours can occur both sporadically and as
part of a VHL syndrome, which suggests that they may be a good
model for studying the potential role of the oxygen-sensing
pathway in endocrine tumours.
The aim of this study was to establish the expression pattern of
VEGF, HIF-1a, HIF-2a and CA9 in a series of pancreatic endocrine
tumours and to correlate the level of expression with clinico￾pathological charateristics, angiogenesis and survival.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Patients and tissues (Table 1)
Paraffin-embedded blocks from 45 pancreatic endocrine tumours
(PET) were retrieved, from 45 patients (37 patients undergoing
surgery, seven patients undergoing diagnostic biopsy and one
autopsy) followed at the Beaujon hospital between 1995 and 2001.
Surgery consisted of splenopancreatectomy in 17 patients,
pancreaticoduodenectomy in 12 and limited resection of the
pancreatic body and/or neck (n ¼ 4) or tail (n ¼ 4). Biopsy
specimen included five from liver metastases and two from
pancreatic tumours. One block was selected for each case,
containing the tumour and the peripheral nontumoral pancreas
when possible in large pancreatic resections (n ¼ 33). The
nontumoral pancreas consisted of chronic pancreatitis associated
with areas of normal pancreas in 24 cases. Tissue sections (4 mm)
were cut and flanking sections from each tumour sample were
studied for the expression of VEGF, HIF-1a, HIF-2a, CA9 and
CD34.
The clinicopathological characteristics of the 45 cases are
summarised in Table 1. Survival data were available for 43 out of
45 patients. One patient who died within 1 month after operation
was excluded to avoid bias from peri-operative death. The median
follow-up of surviving patients at the time of analysis was 32
months (range 2 –86 months). The following histopathological and
clinical data were recorded for surgical or autopsy material: age,
sex, functional status of tumours (hormonal syndrome (insulino￾ma, glucagonoma, somatostatinoma, VIPoma) or not), VHL
disease and type 1 multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN1)
syndrome. Tumours were classified in four groups according to
the WHO 2000 criteria (benign well-differentiated endocrine
tumours, reported as WHO-1, well-differentiated endocrine
tumours of uncertain behaviour, reported as WHO-2, well￾differentiated endocrine carcinomas, reported as WHO-3, and
poorly differentiated endocrine carcinomas, reported as WHO-4)
(Solcia et al, 2000). Most of the WHO-4 cases corresponded to
biopsy specimen because such cases which require chimiotherapy
are not surgically resected. VHL cases corresponded to WHO-1
(n ¼ 1), WHO-2 (n ¼ 3) or WHO-3 (n ¼ 4) tumours. In addition,
the size of the tumour, presence of necrosis, presence of a fibrotic
focus, number of mitoses (per 10 high power field), percentage of
cell nuclei stained for Ki-67 (MIB-1 antibody), vascular embolism
(not evaluated in the biopsy samples), lymph node metastasis and
liver metastasis were also recorded. Tumours with p5 mitoses per
10 high-power field or p5% Ki-67-positive cells were considered
at a low mitotic rate or low proliferative index, respectively. In
accordance with previously reported studies, both poorly differ￾entiated tumours and tumours with high proliferative index were
associated with poorer survival in our series (Po0.0001) (Gentil
Perret et al, 1998; Madeira et al, 1998).
Immunohistochemistry
Antibodies and immunohistochemical techniques The VEGF,
HIF-1a, HIF-2a, CA9, Ki-67 proteins and CD34 antigen were
detected using the following murine monoclonal antibodies: VG1
(that detects the 121, 165 and 189 VEGF isoforms), ESEE 122, Ep
190b, M75, MIB-1 (Dako) and QBEND10 (Dako), respectively
(Turley et al, 1998; Talks et al, 2000; Hui et al, 2002). The
methodology used is as described previously (Turley et al, 1998;
Hui et al, 2002). Briefly, sections were first placed in a 601C oven
for 10 min before deparaffinisation in Citroclear twice for 12 min
and rehydratation. Antigen retrieval consisted of pressure cooking
for 3 min in Tris-EDTA (pH 9) for VEGF, Ki-67 and CD34, and
601C waterbath overnight in 1 mM Tris-EDTA (pH 9) for HIF-1a
and HIF-2a. Permeabilisation was performed with 0.2% triton X￾100 for 10 min for HIF-1a and HIF-2a. Endogenous peroxidase was
then quenched with Dako peroxidase block solution applied for
5 min. The primary antibody was applied, rinsed in PBS and then
the secondary polymer from the Envision HRP kit (Dako) was
applied for 30 min. After the slides were washed in PBS, the colour
was developed by a 5-min incubation with 3,30
-diaminobenzidine
solution (Dako). Sections were counterstained with haematoxylin

and mounted. PBS was substituted for primary antibody as the
negative control. Positive controls consisted of serum in blood
vessel lumen (VEGF), HIF-1a transfected COS-1 cells (HIF-1a),
known positive tumour (HIF-2a) and clear cell renal carcinoma
(CA9).
Immunohistochemical double staining of CD34 and Ki-67 was
performed to detect proliferating endothelial cells. The immuno￾histochemical reaction against Ki-67 was revealed in brown with
3,30
-diaminobenzidine and was followed by the immunohisto￾chemical reaction against CD34 revealed in red with amino ethyl
carbazole. The brown nuclei of proliferating endothelial cells are
superimposed on the red colour of the cytoplasms.
Scoring methods All slides were evaluated independently by two
investigators (AC and KG) who were blinded to the patients’
clinical data. The differences in evaluation between the two
observers were resolved at a conference microscopy. The speci￾mens were scanned at a low optical power (  40) to study the
tissue distribution of staining and at a high optical power (  250)
to study the cellular staining patterns. The percentage of cells with
positive reactivity was scored. The pattern of expression (cyto￾plasmic, membranous or nuclear) and the intensity (negative
scored as 0, weak scored as 1, moderate scored as 2 and strong
scored as 3) were noted. A cytoplasmic score was calculated by
multiplying the percentage of cytoplasmic stained cells by their
staining intensity. For HIF-2a the presence or absence of positively
stained stroma was noted. The staining of the stroma was not
evaluated in biopsy cases because of the small size of these tissue
samples.
Microvessel counting Two areas of high vascularisation were
chosen for microvessel counting at a low optical power (  10
objective) after CD34 staining. The final microvessel density
(MVD) was the mean value of three appraised high power fields
(  25 objective, Leitz, field area 0.442 mm2
) in each area of high
vascularisation (total area: 2.65 mm2
). The vessel counts were very
homogeneous in all tumours and six fields were sufficient to obtain
reproducible results. In biopsy samples, the entire biopsy was
evaluated for microvessel counting. Vessels with a clearly defined
lumen or well-defined linear vessel shape were taken into account
for counting. Tumours with o200 microvessels mm2 were
considered as low microvessel density, whereas those with
4200 microvessels mm2 were considered as high microvessel
density.
Proliferating endothelial cells counting The percentage of pro￾liferating endothelial cells was determined in areas of high
vascularisation using a  40 objective. In all, 300 endothelial cells
were recorded as positive or negative for Ki-67 in each tumour. In
biopsy samples, the entire biopsy was evaluated for proliferating
endothelial cells counting.
Statistical analysis
Fisher’s exact tests examined relationships between categorical
tumour variables. Mann –Whitney nonparametric tests were
utilised to compare categorical with continuous tumour variables
where the number of categories was two; where the number of
categories was greater than two, Kruskall –Wallis nonparametric
tests were used instead. Spearman rank correlations were used to
investigate relationships between continuous patient and tumour
variables. P-values of o0.05 were considered significant. Survival
rates were calculated from the time of resection until the end of
follow-up period (July 2003) and curves were plotted using the
method of Kaplan and Meier. The log-rank test was used to
evaluate differences between life tables. These analyses were
performed using Statview 4.5 statistical analysis software (Abacus
Concepts Inc., CA, USA).
RESULTS
VEGF expression
In nontumoral pancreas, VEGF was detected in islets with a strong
intensity in all cases. Normal or reactive hyperplastic ducts and
acini were persistently negative.
Tumour cells had positive cytoplasmic staining in 33 (73%)
patients (weak intensity in 18 cases, moderate intensity in 10 cases
and strong intensity in four). The VEGF score ranged from 0 to 210
(mean 55; median 30).
VEGF expression correlated negatively with WHO disease stage
(Figures 1A, B and 2). Five of eight patients (62%) with negative
staining for VEGF had WHO-stage 4, five out of 18 (28%) WHO￾stage 3 and two out of 19 (11%) WHO-stage 1 –2. The VEGF score
was significantly higher in tumours with a low index of
proliferation or mitosis count, no necrosis, no fibrotic focus and
a high microvascular density (although this did not reach
significant levels; P ¼ 0.06). No difference in VEGF expression
was observed in endocrine tumours associated with VHL or not
(see values in Table 2). There was no association between VEGF
expression and survival.
HIF-1a expression
In nontumoral pancreas, HIF-1a was detected in islets with a high
cytoplasmic intensity in all cases and was expressed by nerves and
neurons.

The majority of endocrine tumours expressed high levels of
cytoplasmic HIF-1a. Only four cases (9%) showed no HIF-1a
cytoplasmic staining. Percentage values varied from 0 to 100% of
tumour cells (mean cytoplasmic score 167; median 180). The
intensity of cytoplasmic staining was moderate or strong in 35
cases. Nuclear staining was detected in 31 out of 45 (69%) of the
cases (percentage values ranged from 0 to 50%; mean 9.3%;
median 5%).
HIF-1a cytoplasmic expression was significantly higher in well￾differentiated benign tumours (Figure 1C) than in tumours of
uncertain behaviour or carcinomas (see values in Figure 3). The
HIF-1a cytoplasmic score was significantly lower in poorly
differentiated tumours, tumours of large size, with high mitosis
count, necrosis, lymph node metastasis, low MVD or VHL disease
(see values in Table 2).
HIF-1a nuclear expression was significantly higher in carcino￾mas (Figure 1D) than in tumours of uncertain behaviour and in
benign tumours (Figure 4). Presence of HIF-1a nuclear expression
was significantly associated with poor tumour differentiation, large
tumour size, higher mitosis count or index of proliferation,
presence of necrosis, of a fibrotic focus, of liver metastasis, low
MVD and VHL disease (mean values in Table 2). Presence of HIF￾1a nuclear expression was associated with shorter survival,
although this was not statistically significant (P ¼ 0.06).
HIF-2a expression
Nontumoral pancreatic islets showed a weak cytoplasmic HIF-2a
staining. Tumour cells were found to have cytoplasmic staining
(Figure 1E) in 13 cases (29%) and nuclear stainings in 13 (29%)
cases. Both stainings were not statistically associated. Percentage
staining of cytoplasm varied from 5 to 80% of PET cells (mean
cytoplasmic score 13; median 0). Nuclear staining was weak (range
1 –30%; mean 1.5%; median 0).
Stromal HIF-2a expression was observed in 12 out of 38 (32%)
of cases, detected in the cytoplasm of tumour-associated macro￾phages which were present in moderate to large numbers
(Figure 1F). None or few positive macrophages were considered
as negative.
There was no significant association of HIF-2a staining in
tumour cells or in macrophages with histopathological variables,
MVD, VHL disease or survival.
CA9 expression
In nontumoral pancreatic tissue, CA9 was detected in normal or
reactive hyperplastic ducts in 22 cases and in acini in 12 cases.
Islets were negative. Expression of CA9 in the normal pancreas was
stronger in areas of pancreatitis close to invading tumours.
CA9 expression was cytoplasmic (of weak or moderate intensity)
in nine tumours or membranous (of moderate or strong intensity)
in 12 tumours. No CA9 staining was seen in 25 out of 45 (53%) of

cytoplasmic staining varied from 5 to 60% (mean score 22;
median 0) and from 5 to 80% (mean score 15; median 0) of tumour
cells, respectively. Fibroblasts were positive in only one case, in the
tumoral stroma adjacent to a fibrotic area, in a case containing
membranous CA9 þ tumour cell areas.
CA9 membranous expression (Figure 5C) was significantly
higher in WHO-stage 4 or poorly differentiated tumours (see
values in Figure 6). Out of 12 PETs with CA9 membranous
staining, 10 contained necrosis either extensive or focal and CA9
expression was confined around areas of necrosis in seven of those
10 cases. Membranous expression of CA9 was significantly higher
in large tumours, in tumours with the presence of a fibrotic focus,
a high mitotic count or proliferation index, liver metastases, low
MVD and shorter survival (P ¼ 0.0004; Figure 7).
CA9 cytoplasmic expression (Figure 5E) was significantly higher
in tumours associated with VHL disease (values in Table 2) and in
tumours with a greater microvascular density. Cytoplasmic
staining was detected in eight out of eight VHL patients, whereas
36 out of 37 non-VHL patients were negative.
Microvessel counting
The microvessel density ranged from 26 to 792 vessels mm2
(mean 311; median 276). The mean values, (see Figure 8),
decreased with disease progression according to WHO classifica￾tion (Figure 5B and D). All well-differentiated tumours, both
benign and of uncertain behaviour, had 4200 vessels mm2 (in
contrast to the nine out of 18 well-differentiated carcinomas and
eight out of eight poorly differentiated carcinomas, which had
counts of less than 200 vessels mm2
). The MVD was higher in

large tumours, in tumours with necrosis, a fibrotic focus, a high
mitotic count or MIB1 index and presence of liver metastasis. A
high MVD was also associated with VHL cases (Figure 5F and
values in Table 2). Low tumour MVD (o200 vessels mm2
) was
significantly associated with shorter survival (P ¼ 0.001; Figure 9).
Proliferating endothelial cells counting
There was a mean endothelial proliferation index of 3.7% (range
0 –9.6%; median 3.8%). Endothelial proliferation did not differ
significantly between the different groups of the WHO classifi￾cation.
Co-expression of markers
Tumour HIF-1a nuclear expression was significantly correlated
with that of CA9 membranous expression and low MVD. High
cytoplasmic HIF-1a expression was correlated significantly with
VEGF expression and high MVD.
DISCUSSION
Currently, standard histology coupled with evaluation of mitotic
rates and proliferation index are essential in helping to predict the
biological behaviour of endocrine tumours and select appropriate
treatment strategies as a function of WHO disease stage. Such
methods are not always reliable and many tumours fall in-between
tumour stage, indicating that better markers of tumour aggres￾siveness are required. The fact that endocrine tumours are highly
vascular in nature renders analysis of angiogenesis as a prognostic
factor highly pertinent. To date, few data evaluating angiogenesis
in the progression of endocrine neoplasms are available and
mostly applies to pituitary tumours where results remain equivocal
(Erroi et al, 1986; Jugenburg et al, 1995; Sasano et al, 1998; Turner
et al, 2000a – c; Bernini et al, 2002). A high intratumoral MVD was
demonstrated in our study, much greater than those reported in
any type of tumours (Goulding et al, 1995; Fox, 1997; Prall et al,
2003). However, we found a wide range of MVD values according
to the malignant potential, undifferentiated carcinomas showing a
10 times lower MVD than benign tumours. A negative correlation
has previously been described between MVD and advanced
pituitary adenomas and carcinomas (Erroi et al, 1986; Jugenburg
et al, 1995; Bernini et al, 2002), and a recent study demonstrates
comparable results in PETs (Marion-Audibert et al, 2003). In our
series, a high MVD was found to correlate with previously
established markers of good prognosis (small tumour size, well￾differentiated tumours, low mitotic count and low proliferation
index) (Solcia et al, 2000; Hochwald et al, 2002). Moreover,
patients with low MVDs had a significantly shorter survival
(P ¼ 0.0001) and a higher risk of metastatic dissemination. These
observations appear to be tumour-specific and contrast with those
seen previously in most other epithelial cancers (Weidner et al,
1992; Maeda et al, 1995; Weidner, 1995, 1998; Pezzella et al, 1997;
Ellis et al, 1998; Eberhard et al, 2000). The specific vascular profile
observed in PETs may help to predict their prognosis. In fact,
prediction of the biological behaviour of PETs is difficult by
histological criteria alone and patients with metastatic disease may
have a prolonged survival. MVD may help in predicting long-term
prognosis in these patients. As MVD has also been shown to be
correlated with contrast enhancement on computed tomography in
PET (unpublished personal data), use of such a marker would not
be limited to post-operative scenarios.
We demonstrate in this study a specific pattern of expression of
VEGF, HIF-1a and HIF-2a in pancreatic endocrine tumours. VEGF
is upregulated in many human tumours and its expression has
usually been correlated with a high microvascular density and
poor clinical outcome (Itakura et al, 1997; Seo et al, 2000; Hui et al,
2002; Niedergethmann et al, 2002). In the present study, VEGF
expression detected in 78% of PETs, mainly in highly vascularised
benign cases, is in accordance with previous results (Terris et al,
1998; La Rosa et al, 2003). An interesting finding is that VEGF
expression was significantly lower in undifferentiated poorly
vascularised cases.
HIF-1a and HIF-2a are known to mediate the induction of the
HIF-regulated genes. Their nuclear expression has been demon￾strated in several tumours and is associated with an aggressive
phenotype (Zhong et al, 1999; Birner et al, 2000; Giatromanolaki
et al, 2001). Expression of such proteins in perinecrotic areas
supports evidence for microenvironmental mechanisms of activa￾tion secondary to hypoxia (Talks et al, 2000). To date, their
expression has never been described in endocrine tumours. We
have demonstrated a cytoplasmic distribution of HIF-1a in 91% of
PETs and HIF-2a in 29%, which has rarely been reported in other
human tumours (Zhong et al, 1999; Talks et al, 2000; Zagzag et al,
2000; Giatromanolaki et al, 2001; Hui et al, 2002). This expression
appears not to be related to a local hypoxic process, since there is a
high number of microvessels in these tumours. Moreover, it is not
known whether these cytoplasmic molecules are active or not. We
also demonstrated, as for VEGF, the cytoplasmic expression of
HIF-1a and HIF-2a in normal pancreatic islets. This specific
phenotype, which persists in benign PETs, is progressively lost
with disease progression. Endocrine blood vessels are numerous
and stabilised in normal endocrine tissue and probably retain
these properties in well-differentiated tumours. This is supported
by the low index of proliferation of endothelial cells, which
suggests that despite a high MVD there is a low neoangiogenesis in
these tumours. As suggested by the observation of low MVD in
advanced carcinomas, vessels progressively regress during tumour
progression. This is consistent with recently described animal
models showing loss of vessel differentiation and a decrease in
vessel density in pancreatic endocrine tumours as compared to the
normal islets (Ryschich et al, 2002). Expression of antiangiogenic
factors probably plays a role in this phenomenon (Holash et al,
1999; Bergers and Benjamin, 2003; Carmeliet, 2003). In advanced
PETs, low MVD associated with an increase in tumour-cell
proliferation may, beyond the limit of oxygen diffusion, lead to
hypoxia and activation of CA9. This pattern of expression
resembles that of most other carcinomas with strong and
membranous positivity for CA9 at the periphery of areas of
necrosis (Zhong et al, 1999; Wykoff et al, 2000; Loncaster et al,
2001; Hui et al, 2002). CA9 expression is consistent with the
upregulation of HIF-1a nuclear expression in poorly differentiated

tumours, recalling the situation observed in most carcinomas
studied so far. The value of membranous CA9 was underlined by
its strong associations with factors of poor outcome (tumour size
and differentiation), but especially with a shorter survival
(P ¼ 0.0004). A diffuse cytoplasmic CA9 pattern of expression as
a specific feature of VHL cases was observed in our series, differing
from the strong membranous staining that we found in
undifferentiated tumours. In most tumours, CA9 is a transmem￾brane enzyme with an extracellular active site, linked to aggressive
tumour behaviour (Opavsky et al, 1996; Wykoff et al, 2000;
Loncaster et al, 2001; Hui et al, 2002; Turner et al, 2002). The role
of cytoplasmic CA9, if any, is probably different in PETs. It does
not appear to be hypoxia-related, as it is correlated to VHL disease
in which PETs possess a significantly higher MVD but is likely to
be related to loss of VHL function. In cases of VHL disease,
hypoxia-inducible gene expression is constitutively upregulated
(Kaelin, 2002). This is consistent with the frequency of nuclear
HIF-1a that we found in VHL-related PETs. In renal cell
carcinomas, VHL inactivation occurs in most sporadic cases,
resulting in an accumulation of CA9, HIF-1a and HIF-2a (Ivanov
et al, 1998; Turner et al, 2002). Our results, showing no CA9
accumulation in well-differentiated, non-VHL tumours, are con￾sistent with the fact that VHL mutations have only been reported
in the initial progression of a small proportion of PETs (Chung
et al, 1997; Moore et al, 2001; Gumbs et al, 2002). Only one PET
expressed weak levels of cytoplasmic CA9 without any clinical
symptoms of VHL disease in our series. It could be hypothesised
that this case may represent a sporadic VHL mutation.
In conclusion, this study shows that as PETs progress there is
loss of the baseline VEGF expression and decresead MVD. There is
a partial switch to hypoxia pathways in malignant undifferentiated
tumours, but with an overall low angiogenic activity. Recent
experimental observations have shown the markedly different
effects of HIF on tumour biology in different tissues (Blouw et al,
2003). This is the first clinical study to demonstrate such effects in
the pancreatic endocrine tumour pathway, confirming the
existence of tissue and tumour-specific angiogenesis and pathway
of regulation of HIF signalling.
