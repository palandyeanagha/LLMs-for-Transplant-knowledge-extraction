Association of RNA Polymerase III Antibodies with
Scleroderma Renal Crisis
To the Editor:
The study by Cordullo, et al investigated the prevalence of systemic scle￾rosis (SSc)-related autoantibodies among SSc patients with scleroderma
renal crisis (SRC) in Italy. The authors report that the majority of the SRC
patients had anti-topoisomerase I (anti-topo I) antibody (30/46, 65%),
whereas a minority of patients (7/46, 15%) had anti-RNA polymerase III
(RNAP)1.
We reviewed cases of SRC in the Scleroderma Family Registry and
DNA Repository (Registry) in the USA, which consisted of 1029 patients
with SSc at the time of analysis. All patients fulfilled American College of
Rheumatology preliminary classification criteria2 or had at least 3 of the 5
features of CREST (calcinosis, Raynaud’s phenomenon, esophageal dys￾function, sclerodactyly, telangiectasia); the diagnosis was verified by med￾ical record review. The Registry database included demographic features,
clinical disease characteristics, including extent of skin involvement, and
autoantibody results. In addition, date of disease onset, defined as the time
of first non-Raynaud’s phenomenon symptom and time of SRC onset, was
abstracted. Methods for detecting autoantibodies were indirect immunoflu￾orescence on HEp-2 cells for antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and anticen￾tromere (ACA) antibodies, immunodiffusion against calf-thymus extract
for the presence of anti-topo I and anti-ribonucleoprotein (RNP) antibodies
(Inova Diagnostics, San Diego, CA, USA), and commercially available
enzyme-linked immunoassay for RNAP (MBL, Nagoya, Japan).
A total of 47 cases with SRC (5%) were identified in the Registry.
Ethnicities of SSc patients with SRC were 35 (74%) Caucasian, 3 (6%)
African American, and 8 (17%) Hispanic. As expected, there was a female
predominance (F:M ratio 6:1). Further, the majority of patients had diffuse
disease (39/47, 83%) and a positive ANA (39/47, 83%). Among patients
with SRC, RNAP III was present in the majority of cases (25/47, 52%),
while anti-topo I was detected in only 5 (11%) cases; further, only 2 (4%)
patients had anti-RNP antibodies, while none had ACA.
The prevalence of anti-topo I and RNAP III in the Registry in SSc
patients with SRC parallels other North American and European studies3,4.
Using chi-square, SRC was associated with RNAP III (p < 0.001, OR 6.4,
95% CI 3.4–12.2), while anti-topo I did not show a correlation with SRC
(p = 0.097) in the Registry, which is consistent with previous studies3,5. In
fact, there was a trend toward anti-topo I being protective against SRC (OR
0.45, 95% CI 0.14–1.15), although this was not statistically significant.
The median time between disease onset and occurrence of SRC was 12.97
months, with this time interval being shorter than 48 months in 69% of
cases. In addition, using Cox proportional hazards regression, the time
from disease onset to SRC was found to be shorter in patients with RNAP
III [p < 0.001, hazard ratio (HR) = 7.5, 95% CI 4.0–13.9], while time to
SRC was longer for patients with anti-topo I (p = 0.048, HR = 0.31, 95%
CI 0.09–0.99). This observation supports a similar finding by Cordullo, et
al1 indicating SSc patients with RNAP develop SRC earlier in the course
of their disease. However, our findings regarding prevalence of autoanti￾bodies in SRC were divergent from the reported study. Cordullo, et al did
not report any formal associations of these autoantibodies with SRC, pos￾sibly because their study was a case series and lacked a control group (SSc
patients without SRC)1. The difference in prevalence of autoantibodies
among SRC patients between the Italian and our population might origi￾nate from the lower prevalence of RNAP III among Italians as alluded to
by Cordullo, et al1. Bardoni, et al reported a prevalence of 8% for
anti-RNAP I-III autoantibodies in an Italian SSc sample6, which is lower
than the 12% reported by Bunn, et al in a British population5, and 17%
prevalence in our overall sample. It is conceivable that a large study of
Italian SSc patients with a greater number of RNAP-positive cases would
show a similar positive association of RNAP antibodies with SRC as
observed by ourselves and other groups.
