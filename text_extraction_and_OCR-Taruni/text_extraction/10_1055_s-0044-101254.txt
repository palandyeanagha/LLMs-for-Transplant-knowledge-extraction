ABSTRACT
The updated version of the EFSUMB guidelines on the applica￾tion of non-hepatic contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS)
deals with the use of microbubble ultrasound contrast outside
the liver in the many established and emerging applications.
ZUSAMMENFASSUNG
Die aktualisierte Version der EFSUMB-Leitlinien für die Anwen￾dung von nicht-hepatischem kontrastverstärktem Ultraschall
(CEUS) befasst sich mit der Verwendung von Mikrobläschen
Ultraschall-Kontrastmitteln außerhalb der Leber in zahl￾reichen etablierten und neu entstehenden Einsatzbereichen.
Introduction and general considerations
Previous contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) documents from
the European Federation of Societies for Ultrasound in Medicine
and Biology (EFSUMB) encompassing hepatic and non-hepatic
applications have been published with a statement on CEUS use
in pediatric applications. The present document reflects the
current applications in non-hepatic CEUS and updates the
previous EFSUMB guidelines published in 2012. The EFSUMB
guidelines on CEUS are intended to inform clinical practice rather
than to report on research projects. Thus, they are a digest of
current findings, formulated by a group of experts and are prima￾rily based on surveys of the published peer-reviewed literature
(so that abstracts and conference proceedings are excluded).
Levels of evidence (LoE) and grade of recommendation (GoR) are
formulated and presented to the reader to enable comprehensive
understanding of the current clinical status of each CEUS applica￾tion and based on the criteria used as in previous EFSUMB guide￾lines; levels of evidence and grades of recommendations are
assigned according to the Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Med￾icine criteria (http://www.cebm.net/oxford-centre-evidence￾based-medicine-levels-evidence-march-2009/). A consensus opi￾nion was established by vote as follows: strong consensus
(> 95 %), broad consensus (75 – 95 %), with approval, disapproval
or abstaining from each participant. It is important to consider
that nearly all applications contained in the current guidelines
are “off-label” and are likely to remain so for some time. This
does not present an impediment to the use of ultrasound contrast
agents (UCAs) when applied outside licensing, a topic detailed in
an accompanying article to previous guidelines. Indeed the
EFSUMB guidelines provide the evidence to incorporate UCAs
into clinical practice despite being “off-label”, influencing regula￾tory authorities to sanction use as recently demonstrated by the
Food and Drug Administration of the United States of America
approval of UCAs in pediatric practice.
In general, CEUS is most useful where an abnormality can be
displayed on B-mode ultrasound (US), and the better the quality
of the B-mode imaging, the better the quality of the CEUS ima￾ges. Importantly, CEUS is always used as an extension of conven￾tional US (B-mode and color Doppler). Contrast studies should
always be interpreted in the context of the overall clinical picture,
other imaging and laboratory tests.
Overall, UCAs are mainly used as vascular agents following
intravenous injection and they highlight the macro- and micro￾vascular systems. However, they can also be instilled into body
cavities, both normal and pathological. Instillation into the urinary
bladder for vesicoureteral reflux is a classic example. Other exam￾ples include instillation into drainage catheters to define their
position, the extent of the cavity and its continuity. Intradermal
injection is used as a form of lymphangiography, with the UCA
being spontaneously taken up into the lymphatics as an extension
of their normal particle trapping activity. It is used to highlight
sentinel lymph nodes, chiefly in breast cancer.
Investigator training
One of the central strategies of EFSUMB is to ensure high-quality
US education and sustain excellent professional standards in CEUS
training and practice. Previously, EFSUMB defined three levels of
training requirements in a minimal training standards document,
with specific reference to CEUS in Appendix 14. EFSUMB recom￾mends that CEUS should be performed by operators that have
achieved competence Level 1, as it has been recognized that the
diagnostic performance of CEUS is dependent on the observer’s
level of experience. Accordingly, appropriate training and educa￾tion is strongly advised for every investigator who performs CEUS
examinations. Furthermore, investigators should ensure that their
US scanning machine is optimized for CEUS acquisition and the
post-processing of data. The operator must gain sufficient knowl￾edge of indications and contraindications of CEUS and training in

ultrasound contrast agent administration and perform CEUS
within the medico-legal framework of each individual country.
RECOMMENDATION 1
The operator must gain sufficient knowledge and training in
CEUS, ultrasound contrast agent administration and contrain￾dications, and perform the examination within the medico￾legal framework of each individual country (LoE 5, GoR C).
Strong consensus (20/0/0, 100 %)
Terminology
Equipment
Ultrasound equipment based on contrast-specific ultrasound
modes is needed for CEUS examinations, based on the separation
between non-linear response induced by microbubble UCA oscil￾lations and linear US signal reflected by tissues. In order to
decrease the non-linear harmonic US signals generated by the tis￾sues themselves, a low acoustic pressure is generally used, based
on a low mechanical index (MI). Generally, a low MI examination is
typically considered below 0.3 in order to minimize microbubble
disruption, but also reduce tissue harmonics and artifacts. Never￾theless, most of the US systems are able to perform CEUS exami￾nations with lower values of the MI, even 0.08 or 0.05, and MI
values vary with the different US manufacturers.
Terminology
Ultrasound contrast agents are used for enhancement of the US
signal from flowing blood as they are limited to the blood vessels
(blood pool UCA). They were initially developed to enhance the
Doppler US signals, based on higher MI techniques as opposed to
the currently widely applied low MI specific modes. During high
MI Doppler modes, injection of a UCA as a bolus produces
“blooming”, due to flash or movement artifacts, which are not
visible using specific harmonic imaging modes. The CEUS acro￾nym has been introduced by EFSUMB and is generally accepted
as the official term describing contrast enhanced ultrasonography
techniques. Low MI techniques are preferred to the high MI tech￾niques based on Doppler or power Doppler modes. Most of the
ultrasound systems have a dual split-screen display setting, with
the low MI CEUS image shown alongside a conventional B-mode
image. In the CEUS window, only a few signals from intensely
reflective structures (e. g. calcifications or interfaces that
produce large differences in acoustic impedance) should be
seen, dependent on the settings of the MI and gain. Modes with
a single screen display can also be used, where the CEUS image is
displayed as a color overlay on the conventional B-mode image.
Each examined lesion should be described in terms of
enhancement, taking into account the temporal behavior, degree
of enhancement as compared with the surrounding tissues (non￾enhanced, hypo-enhanced, iso-enhanced or hyper-enhanced), as
well as the contrast distribution (homogeneity or heterogeneity).
Two phases are described for most organs that have a single arter￾ial blood supply (except the liver and lungs):
a) the arterial phase starts from around 10 – 20 seconds until
around 35 – 40 seconds after contrast injection, showing a
progressive degree of enhancement;
b) the venous phase starts from around 30 to 45 seconds after
contrast injection, showing a plateau and then a progressive
decrease.
Safety
UCAs are administered safely in various applications with minimal
risk to patients. They are not excreted through the kidneys, and
can be safely administered to patients with renal insufficiency
with no risk of contrast-related nephropathy or nephrogenic sys￾temic fibrosis. There is no need for blood tests prior to UCA injec￾tion, and there is no evidence of any effect on thyroid function, as
UCAs do not contain iodine. UCAs have a very low rate of anaphy￾lactoid reactions (1:7000 patients, 0.014 %), significantly lower
than the rate with iodinated state-of-the–art CT agents (35 –
95:100 000 patients, 0.035 – 0.095 %), comparable to the rate of
severe anaphylactoid reactions associated with gadolinium-based
contrast agents at 0.001 – 0.01 %. Serious anaphylactoid reactions
to UCAs are observed in approximately 1:10 000 exposures.
Data from 75 completed studies (pooled data from 6307 pa￾tients) in North America, Europe, and Asia showed that the most
frequent adverse events were headache (2.1 %), nausea (0.9 %),
chest pain (0.8 %) and chest discomfort (0.5 %). All other adverse
events occurred at a frequency of < 0.5 %. Most adverse events
were mild and resolved spontaneously within a short time without
sequelae. In most cases allergy-like events and hypotension oc￾curred within a few minutes following the injection of the UCA.
The overall reported rate of fatalities attributed to one UCA,
SonoVue™ (Bracco, Milan), is low (14/2447 083 exposed patients;
0.0006 %) and compares favorably with the risk for fatal events
reported for iodinated contrast agents (approximately 0.001 %).
In all reported fatalities after use of a UCA, in both cardiac and
non-cardiac cases, an underlying patient medical circumstance
played a major role in the fatal outcome. The intravesical adminis￾tration of UCAs has been evaluated in a total of 7082 children
described in 15 studies and in a European survey of 4131 children
with 0.8 % reported adverse events, mostly related to bladder
catheterization.
Contrast-enhanced ultrasound is also used off-label in the pe￾diatric population, and in renal assessment, and in numerous
other documented areas. The Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) in the United States of America (USA) recently approved
the use of Lumason™ (marketed as SonoVue™ Bracco, Milan, out￾side the USA) for pediatric liver imaging, which is an important de￾velopment for pediatric imaging. A significant reduction of ioniz￾ing radiation exposure can be achieved in many areas by using
CEUS in pediatric patients.

RECOMMENDATION 2
Intravenous CEUS use is safe and effective in both adult and
pediatric populations (LoE 2a, GoR B). Strong consensus (20/

Intracavitary use of ultrasound contrast agents is safe (LoE 1b,
GoR B). Strong consensus (20/0/0, 100 %)
Genitourinary
Bladder
Background
Noninvasive diagnostic imaging may play a role in urinary bladder
tumors, but cannot replace cystoscopy and pathologic staging.
The depth of wall invasion, the histological grade and the exten￾sion outside the bladder are main factors determining prognosis
and therapeutic approach.
Study procedure
Optimal bladder filling (approximately 2/3 of the total bladder
volume) is critical. Insufficient filling prevents lesion detection,
while excessive distension results in bladder wall thinning and
reduced conspicuity of the wall layer, making it difficult to differ￾entiate a superficial from an infiltrating lesion. The layers of the
bladder wall can be differentiated after UCA administration; the
mucosa, and particularly the submucosal layer, exhibit early and
intense enhancement that persists for 1 – 2 minutes, whereas the
muscular layer has lesser and delayed enhancement.
Image interpretation
Characterization of mural lesions
CEUS improves the differential diagnosis of intraluminal lesions,
allowing the detection of tumors, which are vascularized and en￾hance, in contrast to non-enhancing hematomas. In 35 patients
with cystoscopy and biopsy as the reference standard, CEUS
correctly assessed tumor presence or absence in 88 % of cases.
Bladder tumor staging
CEUS is superior to conventional B-mode US for identifying infil￾tration of the muscle layer, but magnetic resonance (MR) and
computed tomography (CT) imaging are essential for the local
staging of bladder tumors. The ability to predict tumor grading
based on the pattern of CEUS enhancement remains under evalu￾ation.
Limitations
In patients with anatomical circumstances leading to poor urinary
bladder visualization, CEUS cannot always provide the desired in￾formation. Similar to MR and CT imaging of bladder tumor detec￾tion, an important limitation of CEUS is the difficulty in identifying
both small (< 1 cm) lesions and large flat, plaque-like tumors.
Tumor position can affect the quality of CEUS depiction and the
accuracy of staging. Tumors in the anterior portion of the bladder
dome are sometimes difficult to visualize. Columnar hypertrophy
of the bladder wall and prostatic hypertrophy can hide or mimic
urothelial polypoid projections. Benign tumors and focal cystitis
are other uncommon conditions that present with focal bladder
wall enhancement and can mimic a malignant lesion. CEUS is
unable to provide a panoramic bladder view, as in the case of CT
and MR imaging.
RECOMMENDATION 4
The most useful application of CEUS is the differential diagno￾sis of bladder cancer from hematoma in patients with hema￾turia when the diagnosis is equivocal on conventional B-mode
and Doppler US (LoE 2b, GoR C). Strong consensus (20/0/0,
100 %)
Kidney
Background
Ultrasound is the preferred imaging modality in patients with
known or suspected renal disease for assessing renal size, detect￾ing focal lesions and obstruction of the collecting system and for
identifying vascular disorders but it cannot definitively distinguish
between benign and malignant lesions. Doppler US helps to char￾acterize renal blood flow, with limitations of attenuation, low sen￾sitivity for very slow blood flow, and angle dependency.
Study procedure
The kidneys enhance rapidly and intensely after UCA administra￾tion, with potential to assess both the macro- and the microvascu￾lature, the former immediately after UCA arrival. The arterial pedi￾cle and main branches enhance first, followed rapidly by the
segmental, interlobar, arcuate and interlobular arteries and then
complete cortical enhancement. Medullary enhancement follows,
with the outer medulla enhancing first, followed by gradual fill-in
of the pyramids. As UCAs are not excreted by the kidneys, there is
no UCA in the renal collecting system. With CEUS only two
enhancement phases occur: a cortical phase, 15 – 30 s after UCA
administration with cortical enhancement seen, and a parenchy￾mal phase, where both cortex enhancement and medulla
enhancement occur 25s – 4mins after UCA administration. There
is normally excellent depiction of renal perfusion throughout the
kidney, superior to Doppler US. Contrast enhancement is reported
to be less intense and fades earlier in patients with chronic renal
disease.

Renal Ischemia
Excellent diagnostic performance of CEUS in the detection of renal
parenchymal ischemia, similar to that of CT imaging and superior
to color Doppler US has been reported. Infarcts appear as wedge￾shaped non-enhancing areas within an otherwise enhanced kid￾ney. The excellent spatial resolution of CEUS allows clear differen￾tiation between renal infarction and cortical necrosis, which
appears as non-enhancing cortical areas with preserved hilar vas￾cularity. Differentiation between hypo-perfused and non-per￾fused areas is clear following UCA administration; only infarcted
areas completely lack contrast enhancement.
Renal Focal Lesions
Differential diagnosis between solid renal masses and
pseudotumors
CEUS is used to differentiate between renal tumors and mimick￾ing anatomical variations not characterized with B-mode and
conventional Doppler US. Pseudotumors have the same enhanc￾ing characteristics as the surrounding parenchyma in all phases,
while the enhancement in renal tumors in the majority of cases
differs from the surrounding parenchyma, with a difference in
the degree or distribution of enhancement in at least one vascular
phase. Renal tumors, however, do not show specific perfusion
patterns. Virtually iso-enhancing tumors in all vascular phases
are encountered in up to 5 % of solid renal lesions. A normal perfu￾sion pattern on CEUS is a major criterion for the differential diag￾nosis between an iso-enhancing renal lesion and a pseudotumor.
A pseudotumor demonstrates the vascular architecture of normal
renal parenchyma, displayed during the early arterial phase, with
branching from the hilum to the periphery without disruption of
vessels or aberrant vessels.
Characterization of complex cystic renal masses
CEUS is appropriate in the Bosniak classification of renal cysts and
is suggested to be superior to CT imaging for detecting additional
septa, thickening of the wall or septa, and solid components.
CEUS allows the characterization of renal cystic lesions as benign
or malignant with at least the same accuracy as CT imaging, but
CT remains the reference method for staging patients with malig￾nant cystic lesions. CEUS is well suited for the follow-up of non￾surgical complex cystic lesions and has potential to replace CT.
The absence of ionizing radiation is advantageous. The presence
of lesion calcification hampers CEUS evaluation of complex cysts
masses.
Characterization of indeterminate renal masses
In clinical practice, most abdominal CT imaging studies are not
performed with a specific renal protocol to characterize renal le￾sions, frequently indeterminate renal lesions are identified. Fol￾low-up US assessment should be comprehensive, including CEUS,
to obviate an unnecessary correctly protocoled repeat CT study. B￾mode US can determine the presence of a simple benign cyst.
CEUS is more sensitive than CT for detecting blood flow in hypo￾vascularized lesions and can be used to distinguish between com￾plex cysts and solid lesions, particularly those which remain unre￾solved after CT imaging, B-mode and color Doppler US.
Renal infections
The diagnosis of acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis is based on
clinical examination and laboratory findings. Conventional B￾mode US is used to exclude urinary obstruction and renal calculi.
Additional investigations should be considered if the patient re￾mains febrile following 72 hours of treatment. In these patients,
with complicated pyelonephritis, CEUS is effective in identifying
inflammatory involvement, characterized by round or wedge￾shaped hypovascular parenchymal areas, most conspicuous dur￾ing the parenchymal late phase. An abscess is manifested as a
non-enhancing area, with or without rim or septal enhancement,
solitary or within areas of pyelonephritis. CEUS can be used to
monitor the resolution of abscesses, which can be prolonged,
even with clinical improvement.
Evaluation of solid renal lesions
A number of studies have attempted to evaluate the differentia￾tion of renal tumors, particularly angiomyolipoma and renal cell
carcinoma, by means of different features of time-intensity curves
after UCA administration. The majority of angiomyolipomas are
reliably differentiated with CT or MR imaging and although results
are promising with CEUS, overlap with both qualitative and quan￾titative analyses with different tumors is evident. In expert hands,
CEUS may help identify renal vein invasion by cancer, as the arter￾ial vascularization of the thrombus may differentiate bland throm￾bus (non-enhancing) from tumor invasion (enhancing thrombus).

CEUS can be used to diagnose ischemic renal disorders, such
as infarction (LoE 1b, GoR A). Strong consensus (20/0/0,
100 %)

Vesicoureteral Reflux (VUR)
Background
Conventional voiding cystourethrography remains the gold stand￾ard for the detection of VUR, notwithstanding ionizing radiation
concerns, despite contrast-enhanced voiding urosonography
(ceVUS) being the superior option. Many early comparative stu￾dies between ceVUS and cystourethrography were obtained with
Levovist™ (Schering AG, Berlin), now no longer available UCA.
SonoVue™ (Bracco SpA, Milan), recently licensed for this purpose,
performs comparatively well, and has a favorable safety profile in
children with high diagnostic performance for the detection of
reflux and for assessment of the urethra.
Study procedure
The basic steps of ceVUS are:
a) B-mode US evaluation of the kidneys and bladder
b) Intravesical administration of UCA diluted in normal sterile
saline
c) Repeated imaging of the bladder and kidneys with CEUS dur￾ing and after bladder filling and while voiding
d) During voiding urethrosonography (transpubic and/or trans￾perineal) may be added.
UCA can be administered via a transurethral bladder catheter or
via suprapubic puncture (0.1 – 0.5 mL SonoVue™ in 500 mL 0.9 %
saline), by slow instillation during CEUS monitoring, until ade￾quate enhancement of the bladder content is achieved; dose
adjustment with excessive shadowing or insufficient signal. A full
bladder is necessary for suprapubic puncture.
Diagnosis of vesicoureteral reflux
Reflux is diagnosed when the UCA appears in one or both ureters
and/or the pelvicalyceal system. Vesicoureteral reflux is graded
I–V depending on severity, analogous to the international reflux
grading system of voiding cystourethrography. US imaging is con￾tinued during and after voiding with the child supine, prone,
sitting, or standing, always imaging the kidneys and bladder alter￾nately as the position allows.
Contrast-enhanced voiding urosonography has a higher rate of
vesicoureteral reflux detection compared to voiding cystourethro￾graphy, as ceVUS is more sensitive to the detection of small
amounts of refluxed UCA. Moreover ceVUS imaging is continuous,
while fluoroscopy is intermittent with cystourethrography, allow￾ing better detection of intermittent reflux on CEUS. Notably, re￾flux episodes missed on voiding cystourethrography but detected
with ceVUS tend to be higher grade, and of greater clinical
concern. The ability to detect clinically important reflux and the
lack of ionizing radiation, support the use of ceVUS for initial diag￾nostic and follow-up evaluation of VUR in boys and girls, as well as
screening of high-risk patients. A limitation of ceVUS is the inabil￾ity to image the entire urinary tract simultaneously. Furthermore
ceVUS is not recommended as the primary imaging modality for
reflux, if the bladder or one of the kidneys is not depicted on US,
for specific urethral and/or bladder functional and anatomical
evaluation and when imaging is required for detailed anatomical
assessment, e. g. in the evaluation of recto-urethral fistulas in
neonates with anorectal malformation. The urethra may also be
evaluated effectively both in girls and in boys. Although evidence
is limited, the technique is promising.
Contrast-enhanced voiding urosonography has been used for
vesicoureteral reflux in renal transplant recipients with recurrent
urinary tract infections, both in adults and children. In 23 adult re￾nal transplant recipients, ceVUS was compared with radionuclide
cystography, in 37 adult patients ceVUS was compared with con￾ventional voiding cystourethrography and in 27 patients (8 chil￾dren or adolescents, 19 adults) cycling ceVUS (i. e., obtained by
filling the bladder and having the patient void around the urinary
bladder catheter two times) was compared with ceVUS in the first
cycle. Results indicated that ceVUS was highly effective in detect￾ing vesicoureteral reflux in adult renal transplant recipients. Com￾pared to techniques involving exposure to ionizing radiation, the
sensitivity and specificity ranged between 75 % – 93 % and 71 % –
95 %, respectively. Compared with the first cycle, cyclic ceVUS did
not improve detection sensitivity for vesicoureteral reflux, but re￾vealed higher grades of reflux.
RECOMMENDATION 11
Contrast-enhanced voiding urosonography should be the ini￾tial examination for suspected vesicoureteral reflux in girls
(LoE 1a, GoR A) and in boys (LoE 2b, GoR B). Strong Consensus
(19/0/1, 100 %)
RECOMMENDATION 12
Contrast-enhanced voiding urosonography should be used in
the follow-up of vesicoureteral reflux in girls and boys after
conservative or surgical treatment. (LoE 1a, GoR A). Strong

RECOMMENDATION 13
Contrast-enhanced voiding urosonography should be used to
screen high-risk patients for reflux (e. g., siblings, transplan￾ted kidney) (LoE 1a, GoR A). Strong Consensus (19/0/1, 100 %)
Scrotum
Background
Despite US being the imaging modality of choice for examination
of the scrotum, findings may be equivocal and misinterpretation
can result in an unnecessary orchiectomy. A challenge is the
unequivocal differentiation between hypovascular and avascular
lesions, presuming that an avascular lesion implies benign dis￾ease, which may be impossible on color Doppler US. CEUS pro￾vides a practical solution by increasing the confidence of the inter￾pretation of lesion vascularity and of scrotal and cord vessels,
allowing for appropriate clinical management.
Study procedure
A B-mode and color Doppler US examination of the lesion with
linear high-frequency transducers should be performed to relate
to the subsequent CEUS findings. A higher UCA concentration is
required to examine the scrotal contents; typically 4.8 mL of
SonoVue™ (Bracco SpA, Milan). The arterial phase in CEUS is the
most important aspect of the examination. The testis and epididy￾mis enhance rapidly but the arrival time varies between individ￾uals. The arteries enhance first, followed within seconds by com￾plete parenchymal enhancement. The scrotal wall tends to
enhance to a lesser degree than the contents. There is no accumu￾lation of UCA in the parenchyma of the testis and the enhance￾ment declines over a variable period of time such that there is
minimal residual enhancement by three minutes.
Patterns of disease
Torsion of the spermatic cord
The sensitivity of color Doppler US with current equipment for the
identification and diagnosis of spermatic cord testicular torsion is
adequate, even in the small volume testes of children. In a small
series of men with spermatic cord torsion, CEUS confirmed the
absence of vascularization, but failed to add any clinically signifi￾cant information to unenhanced color Doppler US. There is no
data to recommend the use of CEUS in spermatic cord torsion,
although the absence of global vascularity can be clearly depicted.
Segmental Infarction
The appearance of acute segmental testicular infarction on con￾ventional B-mode and color Doppler US is variable. Often the be￾nign nature of the lesion is established by its wedge shape with
markedly diminished or absent color Doppler flow. The main con￾cern is the differentiation of a segmental infarction with a roun￾ded configuration from a poorly vascularized tumor. CEUS
improves the characterization of segmental infarction by demon￾strating one or more ischemic parenchymal lobules separated by
normal testicular vessels. Subacute segmental infarction charac￾teristically exhibits a perilesional rim of enhancement, which
diminishes over time and is eventually lost with changes in lesion
shape and shrinkage.
Trauma
Conventional B-mode and color Doppler assessment of the testis
in trauma is well established, but underestimates the extent of in￾jury. Besides integrity or interruption of the tunica albuginea, the
most important information for the surgeon is the extent of viable
testicular tissue, an evaluation which is often difficult with con￾ventional Doppler US because the injured testis is often hypovas￾cular even in viable regions, as a consequence of testicular edema
compromising vascular flow. CEUS allows delineation between
the non-enhancing devascularized tissue and the enhancing
viable parenchyma, enabling organ-sparing treatment. Moreover,
CEUS offers a clear delineation of fracture lines and intratesticular
hematomas.
Inflammation
Epididymo-orchitis is a clinical diagnosis and is usually easily con￾firmed on color Doppler US. Abscess formation is relatively com￾mon in cases of severe epididymo-orchitis, whereas venous infarc￾tion is exceedingly rare, thought to be a consequence of local
swelling occluding the venous drainage of portions of the testis
or of the entire testis. CEUS may be used in selected cases of
severe epididymo-orchitis. It allows unequivocal assessment of
the presence or absence of vascular supply within focal testicular
lesions. However, since both infarction and intratesticular abscess
lack internal vessels, absolute differentiation remains difficult.
CEUS may be able to determine the development of an abscess
at an earlier stage, or the complete extent of a large abscess, and
allow for prompt treatment.
Tumors and complex cysts
The current understanding is that testicular tumors with a diame￾ter of less than 1.5 cm may not show flow on color Doppler US and
thus may be misinterpreted as a benign lesion, the purported hall￾mark of malignancy being an increase in vascularity. Simple testi￾cular cysts are usually benign, but any wall irregularity or echo￾genic debris may be suggestive of a (rare) cystic testicular tumor.
CEUS is able to confirm the absence of vascularity in benign com￾plex cysts and epidermoid cysts. It is thought that virtually all tes￾ticular tumors display vascularization on CEUS, with the exception
of any cystic component and regions of necrosis. Very rare excep￾tions may be represented by extensively necrotic lesions, and by
the so-called “burned out” testicular tumor.
Evaluation of solid testicular lesions
Several investigators have discussed the possibility of differentiat￾ing testicular tumors with CEUS, particularly between a malignant
seminoma and a benign Leydig cell tumor. Using time-intensity
curves, evaluating the wash-in and washout curves may help dis￾tinguish malignant from benign tumors, with a prolonged wash￾out observed in Leydig cell tumors, and reported rapid wash-in

and raised enhancement for Leydig cell tumors in comparison
seminoma. Although these results are promising, both qualitative
and quantitative CEUS analyses overlap between different histolo￾gical types. Quantification of CEUS of testicular tumors remains a
research tool. There is limited use of CEUS in intrascrotal extrates￾ticular focal lesions, with no evidence regarding the usefulness for
the differentiation of solid lesions.
Spontaneous intratesticular hematoma
Testicular hematoma can rarely present with acute scrotal pain in
a patient with no history of trauma. US demonstrates an intrates￾ticular mass suggesting malignancy, but the lack of enhancement
is a good marker for the absence of vascularity and for a benign
lesion, leading to a presumptive diagnosis and conservative man￾agement.

Prostate Cancer
Background
Conventional B-mode and Doppler transrectal US imaging have a
limited role in the detection of prostate cancer because of poor
sensitivity and specificity (approximately 50 – 60 %) and B-mode
US is only used to guide prostate biopsies. There is a correlation
between angiogenesis, as represented by microvascular density,
and the presence of prostate cancer, its stage and survival. There￾fore, attempts have been made with contrast-enhanced color
Doppler US to improve the detection and diagnosis of prostate
cancer, with a reported increase in the detection rate of targeted
biopsies of nearly 50 % compared to systematic biopsies. Low MI
transrectal CEUS became available during the last decade when
contrast-specific modalities were also implemented on endocavi￾tary transducers, with further studies forthcoming.
Study procedure
Diagnostic CEUS is performed using transrectal US and typically a
bolus of 2.4 mL of SonoVue™ (Bracco SpA, Milan) is administered
to image particularly the inflow of UCA in a single plane. The most
useful characteristics for an area suspicious for prostate cancer are
a rapid inflow and/or an increased maximal enhancement com￾pared to the surrounding tissue. Multiple UCA injections (typically
four) are needed to image several planes. CEUS has been used for
follow-up of ablative treatments, with either a bolus injection or
an infusion of UCA used to visualize perfusion defects resulting
from the ablative therapy.
Image interpretation and limitations
Preliminary CEUS results appear to confirm the findings of con￾trast-enhanced Doppler US, with the lack of specificity of enhanc￾ing areas and of any other pattern suggesting cancer. The evi￾dence for the use of CEUS in the prostate remains limited and
the role of CEUS in prostate cancer should still be considered a
research subject. New improvements and new techniques are
becoming available with the potential to increase the role of
CEUS in prostate cancer detection and diagnosis. 4 D contrast￾enhanced transrectal US imaging has now been introduced and
objective quantification techniques are being developed. The first
use of targeted UCA in humans was reported for prostate cancer;
these VEGF-R2 targeted microbubbles were tested in a phase 0
trial in 24 patients (https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/
NCT01253213?term=BR55&rank=2?). The combination of CEUS
and other US modalities such as elastography, in multi-parametric
US could pave the way to a future clinically significant role for
CEUS in prostate cancer detection and diagnosis.
RECOMMENDATION 18
Although CEUS for the improvement of the prostate cancer
detection rate is an active research field, it currently cannot
be recommended for clinical use (LoE 5, GoR C). Strong Con￾sensus (16/0/4, 100 %)
Transplanted Kidney
All of the applications of CEUS in native kidneys also apply to renal
transplants. B-mode and Doppler US are the modalities of choice
for imaging transplanted kidneys but are limited in the assess￾ment of microcirculation and the characterization of focal masses,
inflammatory changes and complex cysts. CEUS can image the
microcirculation which is essential for assessing acute and chronic
graft dysfunction, and is sensitive in the diagnosis of infarction,
seen as a defect in all phases. The defect on CEUS is smaller than
on Doppler US, a manifestation of the imaging of smaller vessels
on CEUS. Cortical infarction and ischemia (absent flow compared

to hypoperfusion respectively) can be reliably differentiated on
CEUS, a feature not possible by conventional Doppler US. Differ￾ent quantitative functional data have been assessed on time￾intensity curves, all related to impaired parenchymal perfusion
(e. g. longer time to peak, lower wash-in slopes, longer mean￾transit time) and associated with a worse prognosis of graft func￾tion and survival. Although these preliminary results are promis￾ing, further studies are needed to assess whether the detection
of hemodynamic changes in renal grafts affects the management
of patients with poorly functioning transplants. Consequently the
quantification of CEUS is still considered a research field in trans￾plant assessment.

vascular complications (LoE 3b, GoR B). Strong consensus

RECOMMENDATION 22
CEUS can help evaluate patients with acute pyelonephritis
(LoE 3a, GoR B). Strong Consensus (18/0/2, 100 %)
Adrenal Glands
Conventional US is able to detect adrenal gland tumors, usually
readily on the right side, but characterization is more difficult.
Size, irregular contours, inhomogeneity, loss of normal adrenal
gland anatomy, and infiltration into adjacent organs, or the dia￾phragm, and vessels are criteria for malignancy. Malignant adrenal
tumors may infiltrate and occlude the adrenal vein; the vascularity
of a tumor thrombus may be demonstrated on CEUS. No CEUS
criteria can reliably differentiate between benign and malignant
adrenal gland tumors, with conflicting reports. Dynamic CEUS
using time-intensity curve analysis has been deployed in the inves￾tigation of adrenal gland tumors without clear differentiation. CEUS
may demonstrate characteristic hypervascularity of some adrenal
gland tumors, e. g., pheochromocytoma, which typically also have
necrotic regions with no contrast enhancement.
RECOMMENDATION 23
There is no evidence that CEUS can readily differentiate
benign from malignant adrenal gland tumors (LoE 2b,
GoR B). Strong consensus (20/0/0, 100 %)
Obstetrics and Gynecology
Obstetrics
The use of UCA in obstetrics is not indicated as there has been lim￾ited research related to the uncertainty of a possible underlying
harmful effect. No recent human or animal studies have been per￾formed. It is unknown whether the UCA passes through the pla￾centa, though this seems unlikely as previously suggested. CEUS
to assess a pregnant mother should be balanced against the risk
of other imaging modalities.
Gynecology
Uterus
Both endometrial and cervical tumors have been assessed with
CEUS. Perfusion differences between endometrial polyps and can￾cer have been documented, and CEUS during uterine artery
embolization to treat leiomyomas might be useful. Currently
there is some benefit to the CEUS diagnosis of endometrial carci￾noma. No prospective trials have confirmed the value of CEUS for
assessing uterine tumors and there is no proven clinical indication
for CEUS use in the examination of the endometrium or the myo￾metrium.
Adnexa
Differentiation of benign from malignant adnexal masses was
attempted by visual assessment of UCA distribution and by quan￾tification of enhanced Doppler signals, but despite some differ￾ence in average values for some variables, no feature with suffi￾cient clinical potential was obtained. By using CEUS, it was
demonstrated that adnexal masses without internal enhancement
are invariably benign, but the presence of enhancement is not a
specific sign of malignancy. CEUS does not greatly improve the
accuracy of color Doppler US for the diagnosis of malignancy in
adnexal masses. A multicenter study on the diagnosis of malig￾nancy in adnexal masses, including quantitative CEUS features,
confirmed that CEUS was not superior to conventional color
Doppler US. Although CEUS findings differed between benign
and malignant ovarian masses, there was substantial overlap
between benign and borderline tumors, although CEUS was able
to differentiate invasive malignancies from other tumors.
RECOMMENDATION 24
There are no recommended gynecological clinical indications
for the use of CEUS, despite the finding that the absence of
any enhancement in adnexal masses corresponds to benign
lesions (LoE 2b, GoR A). Strong consensus (19/1/0, 95 %)

Pancreas
Background
CEUS is not indicated for the detection of focal solid or cystic pan￾creatic lesions, but CEUS improves the characterization of lesions
seen on US.
Study Procedure
CEUS is superior to Doppler US techniques for the visualization of
intrapancreatic vessels. Enhancement begins immediately after
aortic enhancement, with an arterial phase (10 to 30 s), a venous
phase (30 to approximately 120 s). With a pancreatic mass, the
CEUS examination also aims to characterize and confirm peripan￾creatic vascular associations. The late venous phase begins about
120 seconds after the contrast injection and lasts for about 4 min￾utes. A late phase liver evaluation may identify possible metastatic
lesions.
Pancreatic Masses
The enhancement pattern of focal pancreatic lesions is compared
with the adjacent pancreatic tissue. The field of view should
include both. This is mandatory with an isovascular mass but not
essential with a hypovascular (hypoenhanced with few internal
microbubbles) or hypervascular (hyperenhanced) mass. CEUS
provides clear distinction between vascularized solid lesions and
cysts and provides information lesions indeterminate on CT, and
may aid targeting areas following a first negative biopsy.
Adenocarcinoma
Ductal adenocarcinoma, the most common primary malignancy,
is typically hypo-enhancing in all phases, because of the desmo￾plastic reaction with low vascular density that is present in 90 %
of cases. Lesion size, margins and the relationship with peripan￾creatic vessels are better visualized with CEUS. However, for asses￾sing resectability, B-mode and color Doppler US are also ade￾quate. CEUS is essential for lesion characterization and accurate
liver staging. CEUS can help with US-guided pancreatic biopsy.
Changes in pancreatic tumor vascularization during chemother￾apy have been documented with CEUS.
Neuroendocrine tumors
Neuroendocrine tumors typically present as hyper-enhancing le￾sions in the arterial phase of CEUS examinations, owing to their
abundant arterialization, often not seen on color Doppler US. Ne￾crotic avascular areas result in inhomogeneous enhancement in
larger tumors. Based on the ENETs Consensus Guidelines, CEUS is
reported as an imaging method for the diagnosis of neuroendo￾crine neoplasms.
Mucin-producing cystic tumors
CEUS improves the differentiation between pseudocysts and cys￾tic tumors of the pancreas by accurately demonstrating vascular￾ization of lesion septa or nodularity. Mucinous cystadenoma is po￾tentially malignant (may transform into cystadenocarcinoma),
and it is usually depicted as an unilocular round cystic lesion,
with particulate content, irregular thick walls, internal septa and
parietal nodules which enhance on CEUS. Intraductal papillary
mucinous neoplasms (IPMN) are divided into main duct and side
branch duct types. CEUS is helpful for differentiating between
perfused (nodules) and non-perfused (mucin plugs) areas. CEUS
can be employed in the follow-up of borderline cystic lesions of
the pancreas, if well visualized on US, in order to reduce the use
of MR imaging.
Serous cystadenoma
Serous cystadenoma is a benign cystic lesion, typically with a
lobulated microcystic appearance with thin and centrally oriented
septa, which are vascularized on CEUS. When the cysts are min￾ute, microcystic serous cystadenomas may mimic a solid lesion,
both on conventional US and CEUS, being hyperenhanced on
CEUS. Definitive differential diagnosis with respect to IPMN side
branch duct types is not possible on CEUS. Exclusion of the pres￾ence of communication between the cystic lesion and the main
pancreatic duct is required.
Pseudocysts
Pseudocysts typically contain non-vascularized debris, typically
found in the early stages. Pseudocysts do not enhance at any
phase with CEUS, even when heterogeneous on B-mode US. The
reported sensitivity and specificity of CEUS in characterizing pseu￾docysts is up to 100 %.
Pancreatitis
With acute pancreatitis, CEUS may delineate necrotic areas, which
do not enhance. If the pancreatic region is clearly visible on US,
CEUS can be used in the follow-up of acute pancreatitis following
CT staging, to reduce further CT examinations. Good accuracy of
CEUS for detecting necrotic lesions in acute pancreatitis (97.4 %)
has been reported. Significant correlation between CEUS and CT
was found for the pancreatitis CT severity index, extent of necrosis
and Balthazar grade, and as a predictor of severity in an episode of
acute pancreatitis. CEUS can be used as a follow-up imaging
method in patients with initial CT staging at admission. Focal
mass-forming pancreatitis and autoimmune pancreatitis have
been reported to have similar enhancement to that of the normal
pancreatic parenchyma and may be useful in to differentiate pan￾creatic cancer.
Pancreatic Transplant
As with renal allografts, US is the modality of choice for imaging
pancreatic transplants. CEUS can add extra value and diagnostic
confidence when assessing graft perfusion and vascular complica￾tions such as arterial and venous thrombosis, particularly in com￾plicated situations. CEUS can image the microcirculation to allow
evaluation of viability and may provide prognostic information.
Early quantitative functional data shows promise in the diagnosis
and management of rejection and represents a research field in
transplant assessment.

The Gastrointestinal Tract
Background
Ultrasound imaging of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract using
≥ 7.5 MHz transducers usually reveals 5 wall layers and can identi￾fy a thickened bowel wall and focal lesions. The imaging of the
bowel wall with CEUS requires a higher UCA dose, typically
4.8 mL of SonoVue™, a consequence of fewer microbubbles of
the appropriate size to resonate at higher frequencies. The time
of arrival of the UCA in the intestinal capillaries is usually 10 –
20 sec after injection, predominantly in the submucosal layer,
with maximum concentration (peak intensity) reached after 30 –
40 sec. The arterial phase (0 – 30 s) is followed by a venous phase
that lasts from 30 – 120 s.
Study procedure
The bowel should be examined in B-mode and Doppler US modes
to detect the distribution of the relevant pathology, allowing the
area of interest to be targeted for CEUS examination. A difference
in perfusion between healthy and diseased bowel can be recog￾nized by CEUS. CEUS examination allows arterial and venous pha￾ses to be examined for two minutes and the possibility for a late
phase liver examination for metastasis, if relevant.
Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)
CEUS enables quantification of bowel wall vascularity in patients
with Crohn’s disease and is used to evaluate adult and pediatric
IBD patients. CEUS correlates well with MR imaging of intestinal
wall enhancement.
Disease activity
CEUS can add to B-mode and Doppler US in the evaluation of dis￾ease activity in IBD. CEUS performs more reliably than power Dop￾pler in estimating disease activity in Crohn’s. Enhancement in dif￾ferent wall layers can be evaluated and quantified in Crohn’s
disease and correlates to a clinical activity index (CDAI) with
good sensitivity and specificity. In ulcerative colitis, CEUS param￾eters correlate well with histological markers of inflammation.
Quantitative measurements of bowel enhancement obtained by
164 Sidhu PS et al. The EFSUMB Guidelines… Ultraschall in Med 2018; 39: 154–180

CEUS also correlate with a severity grade determined at endosco￾py. Furthermore, histological markers of inflammation correlate
well with CEUS perfusion. Moreover, US evaluation of the changes
of bowel wall enhancement during anti-inflammatory therapy
may be useful for the clinical monitoring of Crohn’s disease activ￾ity. CEUS can also be used to assess postoperative recurrence of
Crohn’s disease. Two meta-analyses concluded that CEUS in the
assessment of IBD activity is accurate and a highly sensitive and
specific method.
Distinguishing between fibrous and inflammatory strictures
In patients with a stricture of the bowel and resultant bowel
obstruction, it is important to determine if there is active inflam￾mation at the site of stricture or if this segment is fibrotic. Preli￾minary studies indicate that the use of UCA appears to be effec￾tive in the recognition of predominantly cicatricial stenosis in
patients with Crohn’s disease, although data is conflicting. Using
CEUS, the active inflammatory components will enhance, whereas
the fibrotic stricture will not. Absolute values for blood volume,
flow and mean transit time of the bowel confirm that it is possible
to distinguish between fibrous and inflammatory strictures in
Crohn’s disease.
Abscesses
Distinguishing abscesses from inflammatory infiltrates is an
important clinical task in the management of Crohn’s disease. If
areas of a significant size close to an affected bowel loop are com￾pletely devoid of UCA signals, this lesion represents an avascular
abscess rather than inflammatory infiltrates.
Fistulas
By injecting a UCA mixed with saline into one of the orifices of a
fistula, it is possible to improve visualization of fistula routes in
Crohn’s disease, defining endocavitary and intraluminary loca￾tions. Fistulas from blood vessels to intestines can also be detect￾ed using conventional intravenous CEUS.
Intestinal Tumors
US is not the imaging modality of choice for detecting intestinal
polyps or tumors. Tumor vascularity can be evaluated by CEUS
and contrast enhancement of rectal cancer has been shown to
correlate with histological vessel density. Neuroendocrine tumors
and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) of the stomach and
small bowel are highly vascularized and CEUS can be applied for
perfusion analysis and planning of US-guided biopsies to avoid
punctures of necrotic tumor parts. Furthermore, the hypervascu￾lar (95 %) metastasis from neuroendocrine tumors to lymph nodes
and the liver can be detected and characterized by CEUS.
Transplanted bowel
CEUS allows the detection of hypoperfusion of a bowel transplant
graft. As in other bowel diseases, CEUS can be used to evaluate
the bowel wall perfusion as well as the patency of visceral vessels
with the advantage of bedside examination. CEUS can also diag￾nose other organ complications after bowel transplantation, e. g.
pancreatitis, when other imaging techniques cannot be per￾formed. CEUS also allows diagnosis and monitoring of treatment
response of intestinal acute graft versus host disease (I-aGVHD)
after allografting. The detection of transmural penetration of the
UCA into the bowel lumen indicates I-aGVHD.
Limitations
It is difficult to visualize all bowel segments using transabdominal
US. Intestinal peristalsis and luminal air will impair image quality
and reduce the repeatability of the quantitative measurement of
bowel enhancement patterns. Improved detection of intestinal
inflammation may be enabled with targeted specific ligands
attached to the UCA. However, more studies are needed to estab￾lish the exact role of CEUS in the imaging of gastrointestinal
pathology, and when performing multicenter studies, it is manda￾tory to standardize acquisition and software for quantification.

Spleen
Background
Splenic abnormalities are uncommon and frequently difficult to
detect and characterize with conventional US. The spleen is ideally
suited for CEUS due to its superficial location, homogeneous par￾enchyma, high vascularity, small size and long-lasting enhance￾ment profile. CEUS is a well-established technique for increasing
diagnostic confidence and accuracy in splenic US.
Study procedure
Although UCAs remain entirely intravascular, they are sequestra￾ted by the spleen, resulting in persistent late phase enhancement.
Enhancement is inhomogeneous in the arterial phase (“zebra
striped” pattern, similar to contrast-enhanced CT and MR ima￾ging) but becomes homogeneous within 60 seconds and usually
persists for longer than 5 minutes. The arterial (10 – 35 s) and
late parenchymal phases (3 – 5 min) are most valuable diagnosti￾cally. Scanning should be continuous during the arterial phase but
then intermittent to avoid UCA destruction. Enhancement of focal
lesions is compared to adjacent (enhanced) splenic parenchyma.
Deeper lesions can be obscured if a large volume of UCA is admi￾nistered. 1.2 – 2.4 mL of SonoVue™ is usually the optimal dose.
Indications and image interpretation
Abnormal splenic size
CEUS is not helpful in identifying the etiology of diffuse splenome￾galy. Reduced or absent enhancement in a small spleen may
indicate functional hypo/asplenia.
Lesion identification
Where the splenic parenchyma is inhomogeneous on B-mode US,
the addition of CEUS will frequently demonstrate focal lesions.
Ectopic splenic tissue
Ectopic splenic tissue will enhance with the same pattern as the
normal spleen. Late parenchymal enhancement will differentiate
splenunculi and splenosis from pathological masses.
Splenic infarction
Infarction may be difficult to detect on conventional US, particu￾larly when isoechoic in the acute stage. CEUS improves detection
and characterization by demonstrating avascular, usually wedge￾shaped, lesions. Enhancement will be absent in patients with total
splenic infarction. CEUS can identify asymptomatic splenic infarc￾tion in patients with pancreatitis and infective endocarditis.
Characterization of focal splenic lesions (FSL)
Cystic lesions
CEUS can be used in selected cases to show that complex cysts are
avascular and therefore likely to be benign. Rim or septal
enhancement may be a feature of splenic abscess formation.
Solid lesions
B-mode and color Doppler US have low accuracy for the diagnosis
of solid lesions. Small echogenic lesions are usually, but not
always, benign, while echo-poor lesions are more likely to be
malignant. Correlation with the clinical history and laboratory
tests is essential. Benign vascular tumors (BVT: hemangioma and
hamartoma) are the most common benign lesions and secondary
tumors (lymphoma and metastases) are the most common malig￾nant lesions. No enhancement (in any phase) or persistent late
phase enhancement is characteristic of benign lesions. Late phase
washout is a feature of malignant lesions, but less pronounced
washout is also seen in many benign lesions. Arterial phase
hyper-/isoenhancement is an independent predictor of a BVT,
more commonly seen in hemangiomas with an atypical appear￾ance on conventional US. Nodular peripheral enhancement with
progressive centripetal filling is unusual in splenic hemangiomas.
Intralesional vessels, heterogeneous enhancement, necrotic
regions and a dotted enhancement pattern favor a diagnosis of
malignancy.
Triage of patients with FSL
Lesions showing low-level arterial enhancement and progressive
late-phase contrast washout usually require further imaging or
biopsy, particularly in high-risk groups. FSL with benign enhance￾ment characteristics will usually be suitable for interval imaging.

abnormalities (LoE 2b, GoR B). Strong Consensus (19/0/1,

Peripheral Vascular System and Aorta
Background
The extracerebral vascular systems with indications for CEUS in￾clude the cervical carotid artery and the abdominal aorta, with
less emphasis on peripheral arterial disease. Conventional US
techniques are limited with respect to the demonstration of slow
flow, especially in small vessels such as the vasa vasorum or collat￾erals and flow in critical stenosis, and the addition of a UCA may
be useful.
Study Procedures
CEUS of the carotid and peripheral arteries is carried out with lin￾ear transducers (5 – 10 MHz) and the abdominal aorta is visualized
with convex transducers (2.5 – 9 MHz). For diagnostic views of the
vessels, 1.0 to 2.4 mL of SonoVue™ is intravenously administered
as a bolus injection, followed by 10 mL of 0.9 % normal saline solu￾tion.
Carotid Artery
Stenosis
Color and spectral Doppler US is the established imaging modality
for suspected carotid artery disease. CEUS improves the sensitivity
of Doppler US and can distinguish occlusion from tight subocclu￾sive stenosis, comparable to contrast-enhanced CT angiography.
CEUS improves the delineation of the endovascular border, char￾acterizing the geometry of pre-stenotic, intra-stenotic and post￾stenotic segments without the aliasing and blooming artifacts or
angle dependence issues of Doppler US. CEUS does not provide
flow information.
Follow-up after carotid stenting
CEUS is a reliable method for evaluating re-stenosis after internal
carotid artery stenting. CEUS has fewer intrastenotic flow artifacts
compared to Doppler US, resulting in improved visualization and
depiction of the complete length and morphology of the stenosis.
Dissection
CEUS has been used to identify carotid dissection. MR imaging
remains the reference standard in the diagnosis of cervical vessel
dissections. When it is contraindicated, the diagnostic accuracy of
US examinations can be improved by the use of CEUS.
Complications after vascular intervention
Post-surgical fistula track visualization can be difficult using Dop￾pler US but is improved with CEUS without artifacts. Additionally,
CEUS may help to image flow in false aneurysms with greater pre￾cision than Doppler US.
Plaque characterization
The accepted predictor of stroke risk is the degree of carotid
stenosis, with contributing imaging features recognized. Plaque
ulceration, which is a reliable marker of plaque vulnerability, can
be clearly imaged using CEUS, which has superior sensitivity and
diagnostic accuracy for the assessment of ulceration compared
with conventional Doppler US. Plaque neovascularization demon￾strated by CEUS correlates well with histological findings, depicts
inflammation as a marker of plaque vulnerability, and may be
used to predict cerebral ischemic events and stratify risk for cor￾onary artery disease. The role of CEUS in routine clinical practice
remains to be confirmed, particularly as objective assessment
with quantification tools remains to be standardized.
Large vessel vasculitides
CEUS can also be used for the evaluation of large-vessel vasculi￾tides, particularly to assess vascularization within the vessel wall.
It improves the visualization of the lumen border, and allows
dynamic assessment of carotid wall vascularization, which is a
potential marker of disease activity.
Vertebral artery
A hypoplastic vertebral artery is more frequently a risk factor for
vertebrobasilar ischemia. A narrowed restricted artery (in the
paired arteries) is more prone to closure, especially when other
risk factors are present. Under difficult examining conditions,
detection of low blood flow velocities in cases of hypoplasia can
be difficult using conventional Doppler US. CEUS may differenti￾ate between a hypoplastic vertebral artery and an occlusion at
the origin.
Abdominal aortic
CEUS can overcome some limitations of conventional US by im￾proving the delineation of the aortic lumen and the detection of
the main branching arteries. CEUS also improves the diagnosis of
aortic rupture by detecting contrast extravasation.
Aortic dissections
A dissection of the abdominal aorta is usually an extension of a
thoracic aortic dissection. In most cases, the true and false lumen
can be discriminated with CEUS, because both early (true lumen)
and late (false lumen) contrast enhancement can be detected,
provided the false lumen is not thrombosed.
Inflammatory Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm
Inflammatory aneurysm of the abdominal aorta is a variant of
atherosclerotic aneurysm that is characterized by inflammatory
and/or fibrotic changes in the peri-aortic region of the retroperito￾neum. CEUS of the inflammatory aneurysm improves differentia￾tion between covered rupture and inflammatory aortic aneurysm.
Endovascular Aortic Graft Endoleak
An endoleak, classified into subtypes depending on the site of the
leak, represents blood flow outside the stent graft lumen but
within the aneurysm sac and conventionally detected by CT an￾giography, although CT angiography is limited in the detection
of some endoleak subtypes. CEUS is able to identify and charac￾terize an endoleak more accurately than CT angiography, with
analysis of velocity and flow direction. CEUS is particularly useful
Sidhu PS et al. The EFSUMB Guidelines… Ultraschall in Med 2018; 39: 154–180 167
Downloaded by: NYU. Copyrighted material.

in the management of “endotension” often finding an occult en￾doleak, not seen on CT angiography. CEUS enhancement quantifi￾cation by time-intensity curves provides additional accuracy.
CEUS for the follow-up of patients with endoleak is possible.
Peripheral Vascular Disease
CEUS has been used to improve the diagnostic capabilities of per￾ipheral vascular US but has not demonstrated superiority. Doppler
US is the imaging modality of choice for the detection of compli￾cations after puncture of the femoral artery, with CEUS potentially
improving diagnosis. The detection and localization of small lower
leg arteries in patient with PVD requiring peripheral bypass graft
surgery is improved with CEUS.
Limitations
Limitations of CEUS exploration of the carotid artery and abdominal
aorta relate to any conditions that prevent adequate US penetration
and also limit conventional B-mode US exploration. Of particular re￾gard are extensive wall calcification and subcutaneous emphysema
after intervention or limited examination windows.
RECOMMENDATION 43

(LoE 3, GoR B). Strong consensus (17/0/0, 100 %)

repair (EVAR) for the detection and classification of endoleaks
(LoE 1a, GoR A,). Strong consensus (20/0/0, 100 %)
Cerebral Vessels
Background
The major indication for CEUS in the examination of cerebral ar￾teries is a poor signal with spectral Doppler US, preventing assess￾ment of flow characteristics. Contrast-enhanced transcranial col￾or-coded duplex sonography (CE-TCCS) is best for simultaneously
depicting B-mode brain anatomy as well as vessel detection and
flow spectral Doppler tracing.
Study procedures
Transducers for CE-TCCS are identical to that for TCCS (sector
1.5 – 5.0 MHz). There are two applications using UCAs: main ves￾sel, i. e. vascular imaging, and “perfusion imaging”. For vascular
imaging, UCAs are utilized to enhance Doppler signals in trans￾temporal or trans-nuchal transverse axial planes and coronal
trans-temporal planes. Technical artifacts may cause inaccura￾cies: 1) bolus injection results in a blooming artifact preventing
accurate Doppler spectral measurements. 2) UCA injection leads
to an artificial increase (1 – 36 %) in maximum blood flow velocity,
affecting stratification of a stenosis. In perfusion imaging, either
low or high MI CEUS is performed with trans-temporal insonation
in the axial plane, but other insonation planes may also be used.
Main intracerebral vessel imaging: interpretation and
evaluation
Vascular imaging
Most importantly, CE-TCCS is used to differentiate vessel occlu￾sion in poor insonation conditions, and to detect very slow blood
flow velocities and low flow volumes (small vessels, vessel pseu￾do-occlusion). The Doppler spectrum adds hemodynamic infor￾mation to the anatomical information provided by color Doppler
US.
Examination of the anterior circulation
A poor temporal bone window (45 % in the elderly) can usually be
overcome with CE-TCCS; over 85 % of the basal arteries of the cir￾cle of Willis can be depicted satisfactorily after UCA administra￾tion. CEUS infusion can be used in patients with poor acoustic win￾dows for transcranial Doppler monitoring to test cerebral
autoregulation as well as language lateralization for surgical plan￾ning.
Examination of the posterior circulation
CE-TCCS through the foramen magnum can increase the depth at
which the intracranial vertebral arteries, the basilar artery, and the
cerebellar artery segments can be identified and thus improve
diagnostic confidence.

Internal carotid artery stenosis
Characterization of flow in the circle of Willis in patients with in￾ternal carotid artery stenosis and poor bone windows is important
for estimating the risk of ipsilateral border zone infarction.
Patients without collateral flow are particularly vulnerable to
cross-clamping during carotid endarterectomy. The use of UCAs
in these patients can provide valuable information for patient
management.
Stroke patients
In acute stroke, the basal cerebral arteries can only be detected in
55 – 80 % of cases with unenhanced TCCS. Reliable diagnoses can
be obtained in > 85 % with CE-TCCS with correlative findings on
angiography in over 95 % of cases.
Perfusion imaging
CEUS is performed with transtemporal insonation in the axial
plane in perfusion imaging, although other insonation planes
may be used. After administration of a UCA, the perfusion deficit
can be detected according to the affected vascular territory in
stroke patients, and in patients with space-occupying intracranial
lesions. CEUS perfusion imaging has been shown to improve prog￾nostic assessment in the acute phase of cerebral ischemia and to
provide comparable results to CT and MR imaging. After bolus in￾jection, time-intensity curves can be generated to extract features
that describe the perfusion characteristics quantitatively in stand￾ardized regions of interest.
Sono-thrombolysis
The combination of systemic thrombolysis and repeated adminis￾tration of a UCA over an hour in patients with middle cerebral
artery occlusion accelerates recanalization but also increases
hemorrhage into the infarct. While of great interest as a method
to enhance therapy, the hemorrhagic risk with repeated CEUS
studies forced the two major sono-thrombolysis trials NOR-SASS
and CLOTBUSTER to be terminated.
Limitations
Despite UCA administration, only the proximal basilar artery can
be evaluated. The distal portion can be depicted transtemporally,
rendering the middle portion as a diagnostic gap for CE-TCCS. The
quality of transtemporal unenhanced imaging is strongly predic￾tive of the potential diagnostic benefit from the administration
of a UCA. In patients without visible intracranial structures and
vessels on conventional B-mode and Doppler US, there is little
benefit from the addition of a UCA. The clinical value of the quan￾tification of enhancement is limited by both physical and technical
factors, with reliable identification of the absence of enhance￾ment rather than the exact degree of blood supply impairment.
RECOMMENDATION 48
Contrast-enhanced transcranial Doppler/color duplex sono￾graphy (TCD/TCCS) improves the diagnostic capabilities of
the examination (LoE 1b, GoR A). Strong Consensus (18/0/2,
100 %)
Endoscopic
Contrast-Enhanced Endoscopic US (CE-EUS)
Background
Contrast-enhanced endoscopic ultrasound (CE-EUS) combines the
advantage of high-resolution US of the gastrointestinal wall, pan￾creas and other organs adjacent to the upper gastrointestinal
tract with the ability to delineate micro- and macrovasculature.
Two different techniques are available: with contrast-enhanced
Doppler EUS (CED-EUS), the intensity of Doppler signals (Color
Doppler, Power Doppler) is enhanced by the UCA, imaged at a
high MI, used to visualize slow, low-volume blood flow (e. g. tu￾mor vessels). Disadvantages of this technique include artifacts
caused by tissue motion and microbubble destruction. Contrast￾enhanced harmonic EUS (CEH-EUS) uses low MI techniques to
visualize flow in small vessels and is established as an evidence￾based technique complementary to B-mode EUS and possibly
EUS-elastography to differentiate solid appearing structures, to
characterize mass lesions, to improve staging of gastrointestinal
and pancreatobiliary cancer and for real-time guidance of diag￾nostic and therapeutic EUS interventions.
Study procedures
Contrast-enhanced high mechanical index EUS
In CED-EUS the color Doppler region of interest box should in￾clude the whole tumor where possible. CE endoscopic Doppler
US scanning takes an extra 3 – 4 min.
Contrast-enhanced low mechanical index EUS
“Peak-hold” techniques may be used to improve visualization with
low MI techniques. With the high-frequency transducers used in
EUS, a larger dose of UCA is used (e. g. 4.8 mL SonoVue™).
Applications in pancreatic lesions
Differential diagnosis of solid pancreatic lesions
CE-EUS can be used to differentiate between solid pancreatic le￾sions, mainly the hypoenhancing pancreatic ductal adenocarcino￾ma (PDAC) and iso- or hyper-enhancing solid pancreatic lesions
(e. g. neuroendocrine tumors, pancreatic metastases, mass-form￾ing focal pancreatitis, and serous microcystic cystadenoma).
Meta-analyses showed a pooled sensitivity of 94 % and a specifici￾ty of 89 % for the differential diagnosis of PDAC from non-PDAC
independent of the CE-EUS technique used.
Sidhu PS et al. The EFSUMB Guidelines… Ultraschall in Med 2018; 39: 154–180 169

PDAC is characterized by hypoenhancement, irregular vascu￾larization and a lack of venous vessels. Mass-forming focal pan￾creatitis exhibits netlike regular vascularization. Hypovascularity
was shown to have a high diagnostic value for the detection of
solid pancreatic masses ≤ 20 mm, and for the differentiation of
PDAC from inflammatory and non-PDAC neoplastic masses. For
small pancreatic tumors ≤ 20 mm, CED-EUS is significantly more
accurate than CE-CT.
CEH-EUS is the more widely used technique for the differentia￾tion of PDAC from other solid pancreatic lesions. With this tech￾nique, microvasculature and perfusion comparative qualitative or
quantitative (time intensity curves, TIC) analysis may be per￾formed. In general, heterogeneous hypoenhancement is typical
for PDAC, whereas almost all solid non-PDAC lesions exhibit iso￾or hyperenhancement. Hyperenhancement with slow washout is
a typical pattern of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (P-NET),
while filling defects are highly predictive of malignancy. In pseu￾do-tumoral chronic pancreatitis, isoenhancement and hyperen￾hancement are the most common patterns. Both focal and diffuse
autoimmune pancreatitis demonstrate hyper-enhancement with
CEH-EUS. Prospective studies indicate that the diagnostic accura￾cy of CEH-EUS and EUS-FNA is comparable. An accurate differen￾tial diagnosis of small solid pancreatic lesions is important. A ret￾rospective multicenter study showed a high accuracy (86 %) of
CEH-EUS for the differentiation of small solid pancreatic lesions
≤ 15 mm. Concomitant use of both EUS-FNA and CEH-EUS increas￾es the diagnostic yield and accuracy of EUS-FNA. In patients with
hypoenhancing solid pancreatic lesions and negative EUS-FNA,
continuing suspicion of PDAC demands repeat tissue sampling.
Staging in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
CEH-EUS may increase the accuracy of preoperative tumor stag￾ing and resectability evaluation of pancreatico-biliary malignan￾cies.
Characterization of cystic pancreatic lesions
Contrast enhancement of the wall, septations, nodules or solid
parts of cystic pancreatic lesions in CE-EUS reliably separates neo￾plastic pancreatic cysts from pseudocysts and non-neoplastic
cysts. However, differentiation between serous cystadenoma and
mucinous neoplastic cysts is not improved by CE-EUS. CE-EUS is
significantly more reliable for the differentiation of mural nodules
from intracystic mucus or debris than contrast-enhanced CT and
B-mode EUS. Further characterization of mural nodules by CE-EUS
(morphological type, height, degree of enhancement) has been
shown to be useful for risk stratification.
Applications in non-pancreatic lesions
Gallbladder lesions
CEH-EUS improves the diagnosis of malignant gallbladder polyps
and wall thickening over B-mode EUS. In gallbladder malignancy
(protruding lesions as well as circumferential wall thickening), a
heterogeneous enhancement pattern, the presence of perfusion
defects and an irregular vessel pattern were found to be typical
features with CEH-EUS. Homogeneous or absent enhancement
occurs with benign lesions.
Characterization of lymph nodes
Heterogeneous lymph node enhancement with focal filling de￾fects is present in lymph nodes with metastatic infiltration,
whereas the majority of benign lymph nodes demonstrate homo￾geneous enhancement. However, due to similar homogeneous
enhancement patterns of both benign lymph nodes and malig￾nant lymphoma, the sensitivity was not improved over B-mode
US. CEH-EUS had a similar accuracy as EUS-FNA for diagnosing
lymph node metastasis of pancreatobiliary cancer.
Gastrointestinal wall lesions
Assessment of the vascularization of gastric cancer is feasible
using CE-EUS. The intensity of enhancement is correlated with
pathological criteria of neo-angiogenesis (microvascular density;
vascular endothelial growth factor, VGEF). CEH-EUS allows the as￾sessment of treatment-induced changes of tumor vascularity in
gastric cancer. Differentiation between potentially malignant
GIST and benign sub-epithelial tumors of the upper gastrointes￾tinal tract can be improved by CE-EUS. Significantly stronger
enhancement was observed in GIST than in leiomyoma and
lipoma. The detection of irregular intratumoral vessels in the
arterial phase and a heterogeneous enhancement pattern are
highly predictive for intermediate or high-risk GIST.
Visceral vascular diseases
CE-EUS may be used to diagnose splanchnic arterial and venous
occlusive disease. Moreover, CE-EUS improves the visualization of
flow in esophageal varices, paraesophageal veins and perforating
veins.
RECOMMENDATION 49
Both low and high mechanical index (MI) contrast-enhanced
(CE)-EUS techniques can help the characterization of solid
pancreatic lesions (LoE 2a; GoR B), especially low MI CE-EUS
for small (≤ 20 mm) lesions (LoE 1b; GoR A). Strong consensus

Abdominal Trauma
Background
CT imaging remains the standard technique for evaluating hemo￾dynamically stable patients with high-energy multi-trauma, allow￾ing rapid triage and reducing morbidity and mortality. CT has in￾herent disadvantages, which restrict its adequacy in some clinical
scenarios: the patient needs to be stable and cooperative (seda￾tion may be required, particularly in pediatric patients), it utilizes
iodinated contrast media and carries the risks associated with
radiation exposure. The latter is an important limiting factor,
especially when a low-risk mechanism of injury and the patient’s
condition would not necessarily warrant a CT examination, even
though an imaging investigation is required. Focused Assessment
with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) has been widely used in the
diagnostic pathway of the trauma patient, with a sensitivity that
ranges from 63 % to 99 % for the detection of free fluid, but has
poor sensitivity in the diagnosis of parenchymal injuries. UCAs
have significantly improved the diagnostic performance of
B-mode US in the depiction of solid organ injuries, with perform￾ance close to that of CT: CEUS can achieve a sensitivity and speci￾ficity of 99 %, avoiding overutilization of CT.
Study procedure
Commencing from the side of clinical concern, the examination
should begin with the kidneys, their enhancement being the
most fleeting, followed by the adrenals, liver, pancreas and lastly
the spleen. The kidneys are studied during the arterial phase,
while the liver, spleen, pancreas and adrenals are studied in the
venous phases. Most commonly, the CEUS examination utilizes
two separate doses of intravenous UCA: one dose is used to eval￾uate the right kidney, right adrenal, liver and pancreas and the
second dose is aimed at the left kidney, left adrenal and spleen.
In follow-up CEUS examinations, the known injured organ is targe￾ted.
Image interpretation of abdominal injuries
On CEUS, lacerations and hematomas will show a complete lack of
enhancement and will be clearly demarcated against the normal
parenchyma, whereas areas of contusion may demonstrate faint
enhancement. CEUS may also readily depict areas of hyperemia,
infarct and active bleeding: any UCA pooling in the abdominal
cavity will indicate the presence of ongoing hemorrhage, mana￾gement becomes interventional. Crucial complications such as
devascularized parenchyma, pseudoaneurysm formation and
acute cortical necrosis of the kidney can also be promptly diag￾nosed on CEUS. CEUS can also allow further evaluation of abdom￾inal injuries where CT findings are uncertain due to artifacts or
where CT is discouraged e. g.in renal impairment and in children.
CEUS can confidently exclude major abdominal visceral injuries
and therefore, patients sustaining minor, low-energy trauma can
be discharged following a normal CEUS examination without the
need to perform a CT examination.
Limitations
CEUS cannot diagnose traumatic lesions of the pelvicalyceal sys￾tem, UCAs being purely intravascular and not excreted through
the renal collecting system. The limitations with respect to bowel
injury and a hemodynamically unstable patient would warrant a
CT examination rather than a CEUS examination.
RECOMMENDATION 53
CEUS can be used in hemodynamically stable patients with
isolated blunt moderate-energy abdominal trauma to evalu￾ate solid organ injury as an alternative to CT, particularly in
children (LoE 1b, GoR A). Strong consensus (20/0/0, 100 %)

Superficial Structures
Thyroid
Background
An increasing thyroid malignancy incidence (≤ 8 per 100 000 in
Europe) would benefit from a noninvasive diagnostic method
that allows reliable differentiation between malignant and benign
thyroid nodules, superior to the current B-mode US features.
CEUS is able to focus on the analysis of macro- and microvascular￾ization patterns.

Study procedure
Thyroid nodule assessment
Qualitative parameters
Qualitative parameters characterize nodule vascularization com￾pared to the surrounding tissue, defined as intensity, homogene￾ity, UCA uptake and washout rate. Hypoenhancement is the most
precise predictor of malignancy on CEUS with high sensitivity,
specificity and accuracy of 82 %, 85 % and 84 % respectively. A het￾erogeneous contrast enhancement pattern has a sensitivity,
specificity and accuracy of 88.2 %, 92.5 % and 90.4 %, respectively.
A ring enhancement pattern of a solid thyroid nodule is likely a be￾nign feature with a sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 83.0 %,
94.1 % and 88.5 %, respectively.
Quantitative parameters
Time-intensity curves (TIC) for quantitative analysis are generated
by placing the region of interest (ROI) in the nodule occupying the
largest possible nodule area and comparing it to the surrounding
tissues. The following parameters are evaluated: area of ROI,
wash-in slope, time to peak, peak intensity, area under the curve,
mean transit time and washout. Time-intensity curve patterns of
washout may appear as poly-phasic or mono-phasic related to the
heterogeneity of the nodule and histology, with a sensitivity,
specificity and accuracy of 76.9 %, 84.8 % and 82.6 %, respectively.
Size
Nodule size affects CEUS examination and interpretation. A no￾dule < 10 mm shows absent vascularization (incomplete neovas￾cularization), while larger nodules > 10 mm appear hypervascular.
Image interpretation
The diagnostic value of CEUS has been analyzed in a meta-analysis
showing high pooled accuracy of CEUS in the differentiation
between benign and malignant nodules. There is insufficient
evidence regarding the application of CEUS in the assessment of
thyroiditis.
Limitations
CEUS is a promising noninvasive method for the differential diag￾nosis of benign and malignant thyroid nodules. However, overlap￾ping data between CEUS qualitative and quantitative evaluation
parameters and criteria of benign and malignant nodules indicate
a limitation in the interpretation of tumor microvascularity. No
single indicator is sufficiently sensitive or specific. Therefore, the
results should be interpreted in conjunction with the clinical
data, conventional US and other imaging examination findings to
improve diagnostic accuracy in the assessment of thyroid
nodules.
RECOMMENDATION 56
CEUS for the characterization of thyroid nodules is an active
research field but at present cannot be recommended for clin￾ical use (LoE 2b, GoR C). Strong Consensus (19/0/1, 100 %)
Lymph Nodes
Background
The US discrimination between benign and malignant superficial
lymphadenopathy is dependent on shape, anatomical appearance
and vascular pattern with a wide range of sensitivities and specifi￾cities. UCAs have been shown to increase the accuracy of the anal￾ysis of the vascular pattern using the conventional color Doppler
mode.
Study procedure
Normal linear high-frequency transducers enabled for CEUS ex￾amination with higher doses of UCA administered, normally
4.8 mL of SonoVue™, as in other superficial structures, are used.
Image interpretation
Malignant neo-vascularization, demonstrated when vessels pene￾trate the capsule of the node away from the hilum, is a character￾istic feature of a metastatic lymph node. A benign reactive lymph
node has preserved morphology and vascular anatomy, with a sin￾gle vascular pedicle at the hilum, containing both arteries and
veins, regularly branching towards the periphery of the lymph
node. Display of the vascular anatomy can be facilitated by the
addition of UCA during color Doppler US. Using low MI CEUS tech￾niques further improves characterization with a sensitivity and
specificity of 93 % and 88 %, respectively.
US studies of lymph node vascularization have limitations, with
most studies undertaken in specialized units and in patients with
known head and neck cancer, melanoma or breast cancer. Vessel
distribution analysis is usually satisfactory if the whole lymph
node is involved but is less informative when focal lymph node
involvement or necrosis renders a CEUS examination (as well as
other imaging modalities) inconclusive. Lymph nodes with lym￾phoma infiltration are unique as the vascular pattern resembles
that of non-malignant nodes, with a reported “speckled” pattern
and a different configuration on time-intensity curves that may
help to improve diagnosis.
RECOMMENDATION 57
CEUS for the characterization of superficial lymphadenopathy
is an active research field but at present cannot be recom￾mended for clinical use (LoE 2b, GoR C). Strong consensus

Salivary Glands
Background
The B-mode US, Doppler US, elastography and CEUS appearance
of parotid gland lesions has been analyzed to discriminate benign
from malignant lesions. CEUS investigations were initially per￾formed with high MI US using color Doppler and later with low
MI techniques. The role of CEUS assessment of parotid gland
lesions is limited by a paucity of studies, and relies on expert
opinion.
Study procedure
Normal linear high-frequency transducers enabled for CEUS ex￾amination with higher doses of UCA administered, normally
4.8 mL of SonoVue™, as in other superficial structures, are used
but fractionated doses have also been used.
Image interpretation
Qualitative approach
Malignant lesions demonstrate chaotic vessel formation on color
Doppler US with increased enhancement with CEUS or with promi￾nent organized vessel formation combined with slight enhance￾ment on CEUS. Monomorphic adenomas showed vascularization
patterns of all other entities. Pleomorphic adenomas with minor
vessel identification on color Doppler US result in poor perfusion
on CEUS. All Warthin’s tumors show prominent internal vessel vi￾sualization on color Doppler US and increased enhancement with
CEUS. According to the morphologic and distribution features of
microvascularity, CEUS imaging of the lesions can be classified into
three types: diffuse homogeneous enhancement (type 1), hetero￾geneous enhancement (type 2) and no enhancement/iso-enhance￾ment (type 3). Types 1 and 3 are suggestive of benign tumors; Type
2 can indicate the presence of a malignant lesion.
Quantitative approach
Parotid gland lesions can be divided into different benign and ma￾lignant lesions by using specific time-intensity curve parameters
from CEUS measurements. Malignant lesions appear highly vascu￾larized, while benign lesions enhance less. The area under curve
(AUC) and mean transit time (MTT) show significantly higher
values for malignant lesions. The intratumoral time to peak in
pleomorphic adenoma appears markedly longer than in cystade￾nolymphoma.
RECOMMENDATION 58
CEUS for the characterization of salivary gland lesions cannot
be recommended for clinical use (LoE 2b, GoR C). Strong con￾sensus (20/0/0, 100 %)
Breast
Background
CEUS in the differential diagnosis of breast masses was an early
application, with encouraging initial results, but this early promise
has not been fulfilled, despite numerous studies using modern
methods including temporal accumulation methods (microvascu￾lar imaging). Studies relating CEUS, MR imaging and biological
factors and studies to obtain a precise qualitative and quantitative
vascular map of the tumor, which appears to correlate well with
prognostic factors or use CEUS to identify BI-RADS category 3 or
4 small breast lesions have all been conducted, without specific
patterns of CEUS enhancement of malignant lesions. A single
study documented characteristic CEUS enhancement patterns
which could be helpful for identifying papillary lesions and for pre￾dicting a potentially malignant papilloma. CEUS has been used to
estimate tumor size in invasive ductal cancer, which in turn pre￾dicted regional lymph node metastasis. Notwithstanding, no
specific pattern indicating malignancy has been identified and,
although an important research topic, cannot be recommended
for routine clinical use.
RECOMMENDATION 59
CEUS for the characterization of breast lesions is an active re￾search field but at present cannot be recommended for clini￾cal use (LoE 2b, GoR C). Strong consensus (20/0/0, 100 %)
Sentinel lymph nodes
CEUS can be used for detecting axillary sentinel lymph nodes in
cancer patients. SonoVue™ 1 mL (or 2 mL Sonazoid™) as the UCA
is injected intradermally into the locally anesthetized periareolar
skin towards the upper outer quadrant of the involved breast.
The UCA is taken up by the subdermal lymphatics and the
enhanced lymphatics can be traced to the sentinel node(s). Initial
experience indicates that the method is non-toxic and performs
as well as the blue dye or radioisotope methods. It enables core
biopsy of the sentinel node and, if positive on histology, is a reli￾able indicator of nodal involvement, directing patient counselling.
RECOMMENDATION 60
CEUS with intradermal injection of contrast agent to identify
the sentinel lymph node is an active research field but at pres￾ent cannot be recommended for clinical use (LoE 2b, GoR C).
Strong consensus (20/0/0, 100 %)

Inflammatory joint diseases
Background
Color or power Doppler US can detect the vascularity in the syno￾vial proliferation associated with inflammatory activity. However,
these US techniques have limited sensitivity and could benefit
from the addition of a UCA.
Study procedure
Reports on the use of UCAs in inflammatory joint disease detect
enhancement by conventional color or power Doppler US (CE
Doppler). A full dose of 4.8 mL (SonoVue™) is used with standard
transducers and equipment when investigating joints with CEUS.
Image interpretation
Arthritis and synovitis
Microscopic examination of synovial biopsies shows angiogenesis
from the earliest stages of inflammatory disease. Proliferation of
hypervascularized pannus can be detected before joint destruc￾tion. It correlates with disease activity and appears to be crucial
to its invasive and destructive behavior. The development of novel
biological therapies (e. g. tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors),
which target the microvasculature, needs more sensitive vascular
imaging to assess response to treatment. The addition of UCAs to
Doppler US significantly improves the detection of vascularity in
active rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis. There is also evi￾dence that CE power Doppler US helps to differentiate active from
inactive disease in subclinical juvenile rheumatoid arthritis of the
knee. CE Doppler correlates with the findings of CEMR imaging,
indicating the degree of inflammation in patients with synovitis.
CE Doppler is also more useful in the diagnosis of sacroiliitis than
conventional Doppler.
Differentiation between synovial pannus and fluid
Early detection of vascularized synovia is a primary goal of the as￾sessment of inflammation. CE Doppler US improves the differen￾tiation between active synovitis and other articular thickenings,
such as fibrotic pannus and articular fluid.
Bursae and tendon
Contrast administration can highlight peripheral enhancement on
Doppler US, corresponding to the vascularized synovial lining of
an inflamed bursa, and can better differentiate between fluid,
fibrous and hypervascular synovial thickening in comparison to
non-enhanced Doppler US.
Therapeutic follow-up
Successful treatment results in a decrease in synovial thickening
and necrosis of the pannus with reduction of vascularity and Dop￾pler US signals. The distinction between fibrous pannus and active
synovial proliferation is important during follow-up, because the
volume of the synovium itself is not clinically significant, as it
may contain varying amounts of fibrous tissue. Fibrotic pannus
shows no vascularity on conventional power Doppler US and lacks
enhancement on CEUS.
RECOMMENDATION 61
CEUS for the further assessment of the degree of vasculariza￾tion and for treatment monitoring in joints is an active re￾search field but at present cannot be recommended for clini￾cal use (LoE 2b, GoR C). Strong Consensus (18/0/2, 100 %)
Gallbladder diseases
Background
B-mode and color Doppler US are the first-line imaging modalities
for the diagnosis of gallbladder disease. The use of CEUS improves
the diagnostic accuracy of US in selected cases. CEUS is not indica￾ted if conventional US provides a clear diagnosis.
Study Procedure
For evaluation of the gallbladder wall, 1.2 – 2.4 mL of SonoVue™ is
used, unless a high frequency transducer is used when the dose is
increased to 4.8 mL, with the arterial phase (< 30 s) differentiated
from the venous phase (> 31 s). CEUS study of the gallbladder wall
evaluates perfusion, contrast kinetics, branching intramural
vessels and gallbladder wall integrity; with a late liver sweep for
malignant metastasis.
Cholecystitis
Acute cholecystitis is normally associated with cholelithiasis, acal￾culous cholecystitis accounts for the minority of cases, but is asso￾ciated with a higher incidence of gangrene and perforation. In
acute cholecystitis, the inflammatory process may involve the
adjacent liver tissue (“reactive hepatitis”) causing hepatic arterial
hyperenhancement on CEUS. Gangrenous cholecystitis, transmur￾al necrosis of the gallbladder wall, causes a discontinuous or irreg￾ular gallbladder on CEUS. CEUS should be considered in patients at
risk for complicated acute cholecystitis. Superficial or infiltrating
gallbladder carcinoma may mimic chronic cholecystitis, present￾ing with diffuse wall thickening, with stones or sludge obscuring
a malignant tumor. CEUS may help to detect a silent carcinoma.
Tumors of the gallbladder wall
Polypoid lesions
Polypoid gallbladder lesions are commonly seen on US (2.6 % –
12.1 % of cholecystectomy specimens). In primary sclerosing cho￾langitis and gastrointestinal polyposis syndromes, 60 % of gall￾bladder polyps are malignant. Malignancy in gallbladder polyps
between 6 – 10 mm is extremely rare, while polyps > 10 mm are
regarded as preinvasive adenomas and papillary neoplasms. Ade￾nomas have a wider vascular stalk, thought to be significant, that
is best seen on CEUS. It remains unclear if CEUS can contribute to
the differentiation between polyps, adenomas and noninvasive
174 Sidhu PS et al. The EFSUMB Guidelines… Ultraschall in Med 2018; 39: 154–180

gallbladder carcinoma. Polyps > 10 mm which show an iso- and
inhomogeneous enhancement pattern may be a criterion to
differentiate adenomas from cholesterol polyps.
Adenomyomatosis
Adenomyomatosis is a hyperplastic process of the gallbladder wall
affecting the complete gallbladder wall or parts of it, with the fun￾dus representing the most frequent site. No intrinsic malignant
potential has been described, but has been reported at 6.6 % in
Asia. On CEUS, the thickened wall demonstrates isoenhancement
with a small non-enhancement rim surrounding the gallbladder.
Adenocarcinoma of the wall
Adenocarcinoma is the most common malignancy of the gallblad￾der arising in the majority of cases from underlying chronic chole￾cystitis. Nonspecific clinical signs result in a late diagnosis with a
5-year survival rate of 5 %. Differentiation between benign and ma￾lignant gallbladder tumors cannot be made by hyperenhancement
during the arterial phase as gallbladder cancers (85 %) and benign
gallbladder diseases (70 %) both show hyperenhancement. The
CEUS features of washout within 35 s after UCA administration,
the destruction of gallbladder wall integrity and infiltration of the
adjacent liver tissue are highly suggestive features of malignancy
and highly suggestive of gallbladder cancer. CEUS can be used to
differentiate between GB tumors and biliary sludge. Gallbladder
wall destruction beneath a solid lesion and the infiltration of adja￾cent liver tissue are highly suggestive features of malignancy.
Gallbladder metastasis
Metastatic lesions of the gallbladder wall are rare with melanoma
accounting for > 50 %. On B-mode and CEUS, exophytic mural tu￾mor nodules extend into the lumen of the gallbladder, with CEUS
indicating a flow away from the wall.
RECOMMENDATION 62
CEUS can be used in acute cholecystitis to better detect local
complications (LoE 2b, GoR B). Strong Consensus (19/0/1,
100 %)
RECOMMENDATION 63
CEUS may differentiate chronic cholecystitis from gallbladder
carcinoma (LoE 2b, GoR B). Strong Consensus (19/0/1, 100 %)
RECOMMENDATION 64
CEUS is able to differentiate between a perfused gallbladder
lesion and motionless biliary sludge (LoE 4, GoR C). Strong
consensus (20/0/0, 100 %)
Neurosurgery
Background
Intraoperative CEUS (iCEUS) allows for excellent evaluation with
distinct enhancement phases and good delineation between
lesions/vessels and healthy structures. These iCEUS features, to￾gether with high temporal and spatial resolution, make iCEUS
invaluable in neurosurgery for vascular and oncological applica￾tions.
Study procedure
Ultrasound equipment
A contrast-enabled multi-frequency linear array transducer (3 –
11 MHz), most using frequently the UCA SonoVue™, is deployed.
Examination technique
Patient positioning and craniotomy must be designed to allow di￾rect contact of the transducer with the brain surface or the cavity
filled with saline, to allow transducer manipulation. A preliminary
CEUS examination is performed through the dura-mater after
bone flap removal, preceded by a B-mode US examination, allow￾ing identification of anatomical landmarks and lesion position/
relationships. A standard evaluation to identify principal arteries,
capillary and veins in the region of interest, evaluating the timing
distribution and degree of UCA enhancement, is required.
Intraoperative applications
Intraoperative evaluation of cerebral and spinal neoplastic
lesions
Neoplastic lesion identification
Standard B-mode US is able to visualize and delineate most neo￾plastic lesions, both intra- and extra-axial. In intrinsic tumors with
ill-defined borders or in the presence of brain edema, B-mode US
is insufficient to evaluate tumor morphology and borders. iCEUS
highlights the tumor parenchyma and the tumor-brain interface
accurately, relying on the abnormal density of capillaries between
the pathological tissue and the surrounding parenchyma.
Tumor characterization
The degree of contrast enhancement and distribution is related to
the density of capillaries in the region of interest. iCEUS allows
real-time characterization of different histological types and
grades dependent on timing, distribution and degree of contrast
enhancement.
Tumor vascularization and surgical strategy
The direct visualization of parental and surrounding vessels allows
determination of vessel location in the surgical field and optimizes
the surgical strategy, allowing for early tumor devascularization
before removal, thus reducing intraoperative bleeding.

Tumor resection control
Safe repeated iCEUS examinations during surgery allow visualiza￾tion of residual tumor within the surgical cavity, overcoming
B-mode US limitations. iCEUS also allows assessment of complete
tumor removal, showing no remaining enhancing areas and an
absence of abnormal venous drainage.
Intraoperative angio-sonography for cerebral and spinal
vascular lesions
Vascular malformations are identified with Doppler US. iCEUS al￾lows interpretation of the vascular tree prior to surgical exposure.
iCEUS is able to determine the location of a vessel and follow its
entire course and may be used with many different vascular ab￾normalities. iCEUS can also verify exclusion of the lesion from the
circulation at the end of the procedure, and can also asses flow
direction, vessel patency after aneurysm clipping, and brain
perfusion in the distal territories.
Intraoperative contrast-enhanced ultrasound in traumatic
brain surgery
iCEUS during surgery for trauma allows distinction between nor￾mal and injured brain tissue, more clearly than B-mode and color
Doppler US. This improves the accuracy of the classification
of traumatic brain injury, effectively removing hematoma and/or
infarcted brain while preserving healthy tissue.
Limitations
Operator training is paramount and the craniotomy has to be
large enough to allow free transducer movement. Transducer
pressure on neural structures must not damage vessels or the par￾enchyma. Static retractors must be temporarily removed during
iCEUS evaluation. The use of hemostatic materials must be limited
to prevent artifact formation and restriction of the field of view.
RECOMMENDATION 65
Intraoperative CEUS is indicated in neuro-oncological proce￾dures for tumor identification, assessment of boundaries, per￾fusion pattern and evaluation of residual tumor (LoE 4,
GoR C). Strong consensus (19/0/0, 100 %)
RECOMMENDATION 66
Intraoperative CEUS is indicated in angiosonography for
neurovascular procedures (LoE 4, GoR C). Strong consensus
(19/0/0, 100 %)
RECOMMENDATION 67
Intraoperative CEUS is indicated in traumatic brain surgery to
demonstrate tissue viability (LoE 4, GoR C). Strong Consensus
(18/0/1, 100 %)
Interventional CEUS
Background
CEUS has obvious potential during US-guided interventional pro￾cedures. Any CEUS guided intervention can be performed in a
similar manner to the routine US-guided version of the procedure.
It may be necessary to use two UCA injections, one to plan the
procedure and a second to perform it. Alternatively, infusion may
be used throughout the procedure. Besides the established use of
CEUS in relation to percutaneous ablation and the potential bene￾fit from intracavity CEUS, potential indications relate to accurate
delineation of tissue vascularization.
Avoiding biopsy of necrotic tissue
By directing the biopsy needle towards contrast enhanced areas
within the target lesion, sampling from necrotic parts of the
tumor can be avoided, resulting in an up to 15 % increase in diag￾nostic accuracy reported in large tumors and liver metastases and
in lung, neck and musculoskeletal tumors.
Biopsy of poorly visualized or “invisible” lesions
When a biopsy is required based on findings from CT, MR or PET￾CT imaging and the lesion is not clearly visualized or not visualized
with B-mode US, CEUS may be helpful in two different ways: the
target lesion suspected from previous imaging may become con￾spicuous on CEUS or additional lesions that are more accessible
for biopsy may be visualized and biopsied.
Further benefits from CEUS in interventional US
CEUS may be used to:
a) Diagnose and monitor all stages of bleeding related to inter￾ventional procedures and guide percutaneous local application
of hemostatic drugs.
b) Improve breast cancer staging by identifying and guiding
biopsy of the sentinel node after intradermal CEUS if axillary
B-mode US is normal.
c) Improve visualization of poorly depicted fluid collections.
d) Avoid biopsy of lesions if CEUS study unequivocally shows
benign lesion, e. g. hepatic hemangioma.
RECOMMENDATION 68
CEUS can be helpful in avoiding necrotic tissue or identifying
perfused tissue in the biopsy of tumors (LoE 2b, GoR C).
Strong consensus (19/0/0, 100 %)
RECOMMENDATION 69
CEUS can be helpful in identifying biopsy targets inconspicu￾ous on US (LoE 2b, GoR C). Strong Consensus (17/0/2, 100 %)

Interstitial Ablation Therapy
Background
Interstitial ablation treatments are nonsurgical options for the
management of confined tumors in the liver, kidney, prostate
and uterus. CT and MR imaging represent the standard imaging
modalities to assess therapeutic efficacy, but with evidence of
the useful role of CEUS in the detection, guidance and confirma￾tion of treatment success.
Kidney
Thermal ablation is an accepted treatment option for unresect￾able renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The American Urological Associa￾tion guidelines recommend ablation in patients with T1a disease
(< 4 cm) with high surgical risk, or in case of solitary kidney. Until
recently, both preprocedural diagnostic workup and postproce￾dural follow-up of patients referred for RCC ablation have included
CT and/or MR imaging, whereas conventional B-mode US is fre￾quently used for guidance during the ablation procedure. CEUS is
an important tool in the management of these patients and plays
a decisive role in all stages of percutaneous ablation therapies.
Study procedure
Pretreatment evaluation
Diffuse heterogeneous enhancement in the arterial phase, wash￾out in the late phase and perilesional rim-like enhancement are
typical features of renal malignancies. Identification of a pseudo￾capsule predicts improved ablation efficacy, and inclusion of CEUS
in the preprocedural imaging workup is useful to compare pre￾ablation and post-ablation tumor viability.
Intraprocedural evaluation
Intraprocedural ablation evaluation is important but CEUS can be
affected by gas artifacts of the ablation technique that can mask
evaluation of tumor necrosis. Normally a 10- to 15-minute post￾ablation period should be allowed before assessing the outcome.
CEUS has demonstrated high sensitivity, specificity and accuracy
for the early detection of residual un-ablated tumor, comparable
to CT and MR imaging.
Follow-up
Surveillance is recommended in patients who have undergone
ablation due to a high local recurrence rate for tumors > 3 cm,
with suggested imaging surveillance every 6 months as CEUS can
detect early recurrence not visible on B-mode US. For the evalua￾tion of residual or recurrent RCC, the sensitivity and specificity of
CEUS are 82.2 – 100 % and 96.6 – 100 %, respectively. The concor￾dance of CEUS with CT or MR imaging is between 80 % and 100 %.
Prostate
Interstitial ablation through high-intensity focused ultrasound
(HIFU) can be applied in localized prostate cancer in patients at
high surgical risk or for local recurrence after radiotherapy. There
is good concordance between MR and CEUS imaging, with CEUS
being able to clearly and correctly identify the devascularized
area of necrosis and the residual viable tissue, permitting immedi￾ate repeat treatment.
Uterus
CEUS in the intraprocedural evaluation of treatment response of
benign uterine fibroids to US-guided HIFU demonstrated that
CEUS correlated well with MR imaging. Four studies for the evalu￾ation of the therapeutic efficacy of uterine fibroids compared the
performance of CEUS to MR or unenhanced US with CEUS
performing well compared to MR and better than B-mode US.
RECOMMENDATION 70
CEUS may be used in the management of patients treated
with ablation therapies including renal cell carcinoma
(LoE 1b, GoR B), uterine fibroids (GOR C) and prostate cancer
(GOR C). Strong consensus (18/1/0, 95 %)
Miscellaneous
Intracavitary uses
Background
Extravascular or intracavitary administration of UCAs may be used
as a problem-solving tool, recognized in a number of reports as an
adjunct to US-guided interventional techniques, with practical ad￾vice detailing the available concepts and techniques.
Study procedure
No standard UCA dosage has been established for intracavitary
applications. The range reported is 0.1 mL – 1 mL SonoVue™
(or a few drops) diluted in ≥ 10 mL 0.9 % normal saline. A higher
UCA dose may be needed for high-frequency US transducers.
Injection into physiological cavities
Imaging of tubal patency
Originally performed using agitated saline infused into the uterine
cavity, hystero-salpingo-sonography has a 12 % false-negative pa￾tency rate. Contrast-enhanced hystero-salpingo-contrast sono￾graphy (CE-HyCoSy) with SonoVue™ provides better specificity,
but is low for the diagnosis of an occlusion. CE-HyCoSy should
only be performed if conventional hystero-salpingo-contrast
sonography does not show patency.
Detection of peritoneal-pleural communication
The detection of direct connections between the abdominal and
pleural cavities, hepatic hydrothorax, can be established in cirrho￾tic patients by injecting a UCA into the peritoneal cavity, early (< 2
days) after thoracentesis and demonstrating UCA passage into
the pleural cavity.

CEUS-guided percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography
CEUS-guided percutaneous cholangiography is able to delineate
the biliary tree via an indwelling T-tube in place of the convention￾al fluoroscopic techniques, with the advantage of 3 D techniques.
This technique allows for deployment at the point of care. UCA
for endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (CEUS-ERC) has been
reported.
Intracavitary CEUS for guiding percutaneous nephrostomy
Intracavitary CEUS can guide percutaneous nephrostomy and as￾sess complications and is able to confirm the needle or catheter
position, evaluate the site of obstruction and assess catheter￾related complications. Patients with contraindications to iodina￾ted contrast agents are suitable for this technique or at the point
of care.
Salivary glands
CEUS injected into the main duct of a salivary gland may be a di￾agnostic method to categorize obstructive diseases of the salivary
glands. The salivary gland is cannulated with appropriate dilata￾tors and the plastic tube of a peripheral vein catheter is inserted.
Injection into non-physiological cavities
CEUS for the imaging of fistula
CEUS detection and classification of fistulas, irrespective of the
underlying disease, is effective. The following conditions have
been reported: rectovaginal fistulas via a transvaginal approach,
vesico-intestinal fistulas via a transabdominal approach and anal
fistulas via the transrectal approach.
CEUS for the imaging of abscesses
Image-guided treatment of abscesses includes drainage with a
needle or catheter, plus lavage. Direct injection of a UCA through
the needle or catheter has been reported to facilitate confirma￾tion of correct needle or catheter position and allows evaluation
of any communication between cavities in complex abscesses.
RECOMMENDATION 71
Intracavitary CEUS allows identification of needle or catheter
position, delineation of any cavity or duct, improved tracking
of a fistula, optionally supplemented by intravenous CEUS
(LoE 3, GoR C). Strong consensus (19/0/0, 100 %)
Free Tissue Transplants
Background
Free flap reconstruction of complex defects after trauma, tumor
resection, burns, or poor wound healing is able to restore the in￾tegrity of the defect and provide return of function. Despite tech￾nical refinement, flap loss due to vascular compromise occurs and
is a serious complication. Early identification of vascular compro￾mise and prompt revision permits early flap salvage, with CEUS
being an ideal technique for the early detection of reduced vascu￾larization. CEUS is the only imaging method for the evaluation of
dynamic changes of microvascularization during surgery and
postoperative follow-up
Study procedure
High-frequency transducers (≥6 MHz) are used to evaluate the mi￾crocirculation of the cutaneous, subcutaneous, and deeper layers
of free flaps most frequently using 1.2 – 2.4 mL SonoVue™. Post￾operative TIC analysis allows calculation of peak and time to peak
of enhancement and regional blood volume.
Image Interpretation
Preoperative planning
The blood vessels in the transplanted free flap are small (1 –
2 mm). The surgeon needs to know the integrity of the flow, pre￾cise number, course and position of these blood vessels in order to
estimate the proportion with a good blood supply. Evaluation to
determine time to peak (TTP), relative blood flow (rBF) and
relative blood volume (rBV) as well as the evaluation of the critical
microvascularization in the different layers of the free flaps is
undertaken.
Intraoperative imaging
CEUS enables the identification of perforator vessels intraopera￾tively, detecting abnormalities, to allow a more accurate decision
as to whether the entire flap is perfused and if the estimated flap
size is correct.
Postoperative monitoring
The feeding vessels or, if there is a connection to a bypass, the
anastomosis, as well as the free flap vessels is examined identify￾ing thrombosis, embolism, twisting, kinking, or compression to
confirm successful surgical salvage.
Critical microvascularization
A significant difference between normally vascularized and com￾promised flaps can be observed most usefully with TTP and RBF.
For CEUS and CE-MRI, the mean signal increase of the TIC was sig￾nificantly higher in ROIs of normally perfused flaps compared
to compromised flaps. With CEUS, the exact size of the necrotic
regions, hematoma or seroma can be evaluated by analyzing
avascular areas.
Limitations
A limitation for the evaluation of flap perfusion is the time allowed
after a bolus injection of the UCA. Continuous infusion may im￾prove this, but this has not been evaluated.

RECOMMENDATION 72
CEUS may be used for the pre-, peri-, and postoperative eval￾uation of vascularization in free flap transplantation (LoE 2,
GoR B). Strong consensus (19/0/0, 100 %)
Lung
Background
US of parenchymal lung lesions targets only those lesions abutting
the pleura, and in this context, an accurate diagnosis is possible.
CEUS in the evaluation of lung lesions is less well investigated.
The lung parenchyma has a dual arterial system, the pulmonary
arteries and the bronchial arteries. The ratio between blood sup￾ply from pulmonary arteries and bronchial arteries varies depend￾ing on the etiology of the underlying disease.
Study Procedure
The administered dose varies (SonoVue™ 2.4, rarely 4.8 mL) fol￾lowed by a bolus of normal saline, with the enhancement continu￾ously observed for at least 30 seconds. A time to enhancement of
< 10 seconds is indicative of a predominant supply from pulmo￾nary arteries.
Clinical applications
CEUS might be a valuable tool to differentiate benign from malig￾nant lesions and in the assessment of pulmonary embolic consoli￾dation. Studies are limited, with few patients to allow for determi￾nation of the diagnostic value of CEUS in the evaluation of lung
lesions.
Pneumonia
Pneumonia is mainly supplied by the pulmonary artery, resulting
in early (< 10 seconds) homogenous enhancement. CEUS has also
been reported to be a valuable tool for detecting and guiding
drainage of abscess formation within pneumonia.
Pulmonary embolism
Embolic consolidations in patients with pulmonary embolism are
reported to show absent or non-homogenous enhancement on
CEUS, a consequence of variable degrees of bronchial arterial
supply. This feature could be helpful for distinguishing pulmonary
infarction from pneumonia or compression atelectasis.
Atelectasis
Compression atelectasis is mainly supplied by the pulmonary ar￾tery and demonstrates early, marked enhancement on CEUS,
whereas obstructive atelectasis presents with a delayed enhance￾ment pattern. Responsive vasoconstriction in obstructive atelec￾tasis is considered responsible for the differences in enhancement
pattern, but this is debatable.
Lung cancer
The enhancement pattern of lung cancer is variable, but there are
suggestions that delayed (> 7.5 seconds) enhancement in neo￾plastic lesions might be a useful characterization of malignant pul￾monary lesions. CEUS may be used to avoid areas of necrosis in
US-guided biopsies to increase diagnostic accuracy.
RECOMMENDATION 73
CEUS may be used to delineate lung abscesses (LoE 3b, GoR C)
and to guide US biopsy of non-necrotic areas of visualized
lung lesions (LoE 3b, GoR C). Strong Consensus (16/0/3,
100 %)
Tumor Response Assessment
Background
The advent of novel therapies targeting tumor angiogenesis and
vascularity has highlighted the need for accurate and reproduci￾ble quantitative techniques to assess early changes in tumor vas￾cularity. However, as these therapies are predominantly cytostat￾ic, current response assessment, which is based on interval
evaluation of the tumor size using the Response Evaluation Crite￾ria In Solid Tumors (RECIST), is inadequate as it reflects only late
changes and is unable to identify non-responders at an early
time-point.
Study procedure
Dynamic contrast-enhanced US (DCE-US) can be performed using
two different approaches with different results:
Bolus injection of a UCA with TIC analysis
Single plane imaging is usually performed at 10 – 20 frames per
second for the duration of the enhancement. The average intensi￾ty within a region of interest (ROI) can be displayed as a function
of time, i. e., a TIC which describes the wash-in and washout of the
UCA in the ROI. In addition, a second ROI can be placed in a refer￾ence tissue for comparison purposes. The majority of clinical stud￾ies to date are based on this method.
Intravenous infusion of a UCA with disruption-replenishment
analysis
The UCA is administered over 5 to 20 minutes. UCA is first imaged
without being disrupted at a low MI, then the MI is increased for a
few frames, causing microbubble disruption. Immediately after
that, the MI is returned to the non-disrupting level to observe the
replenishment of the microbubbles into the ROI. Various models
describe the echo-signal dynamics during the UCA-replenishment
phase, which can be used for flow analysis. Initially, monitoring for
tumor response with UCAs relied on qualitative analyses, but new
methodologies have been developed to produce more robust and
semi-quantitative indices. Analyses of the TIC, including wash-in
Sidhu PS et al. The EFSUMB Guidelines… Ultraschall in Med 2018; 39: 154–180 179

and washout times, can be performed with curve fitting to deter￾mine functional indices. The main indices include: peak intensity
(PI); area under the curve (AUC); area under the wash-in (AUWI);
area under the washout (AUWO; all corresponding to blood vol￾ume); time to peak intensity (TPI); slope of the wash-in (SWI;
both corresponding to blood flow); and mean transit time (MTT).
No permeability information can be obtained because of the pure
blood pool nature of microbubbles.
Clinical application
Early clinical trials employed qualitative analysis in the assessment
of the response of different tumors such as gastrointestinal stro￾mal tumor (GIST) or renal cell carcinoma. More recently, there
have been studies using semi-quantitative techniques with UCA
bolus injection in renal cell carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC) and GIST. Studies showed that two indices representing
blood volume correlated with the RECIST response; one study on
renal cell carcinoma demonstrated a correlation of such indices
with Progression Free Survival and Overall Survival. The results
could not be reproduced in a study tested the disruption-replen￾ishment technique versus Progression Free Survival assessed by
the RECIST method.
A multicenter study of various types of tumors treated with
anti-angiogenic therapies, such as metastatic renal cell carcino￾ma, GIST, colon cancer, melanoma, breast cancer and HCC, with
approximately half of the tumors being located outside the liver,
is currently being conducted in 539 patients with more than 2000
DCE-US scans. A quality score was proposed in a standardized ac￾quisition, with AUC being the best parameter. A decrease of 40 %
at one month was significantly correlated with Freedom From Pro￾gression (FFP) and also with Overall Survival which is the best end￾point for the validation of a biomarker. There is now emerging evi￾dence that DCE-US may be used with appropriate tools to differ￾entiate between responders and non-responders at an earlier
stage than conventional methods and this potentially allows tai￾loring of the treatment regimen, particularly changing treatment
for non-responders. DCE-US has been endorsed by the European
Medical Oncology Society to assess response under biological
therapy for GIST.
RECOMMENDATION 74
