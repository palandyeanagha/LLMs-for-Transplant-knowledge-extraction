Extract
Thirty-two children with phenylketonuria in whom dietary therapy was started prior to 6 months
of age are reviewed. Evidence of profound malnutrition during year 1 of life, demonstrated by defi￾cient growth, anemia, hypoproteinemia, roentgenographic bone changes, and various clinical symp￾toms, was found in three patients. In two of these patients, the malnutrition was quickly corrected;
present intelligence levels in these patients are dull normal. The third patient, however, suffered
prolonged malnutrition and the present IQ,is only 50. Signs of less severe but prolonged malnutrition
were found in 16 patients with phenylketonuria despite apparently adequate diets and adequate
levels of phenylalanine in serum. Three of these are retarded, five are borderline, six are in the dull
normal intelligence range, and two are normal.
In 13 recently diagnosed cases of phenylketonuria, more liberal amounts of phenylalanine and
protein were given that resulted in moderate elevation of phenylalanine levels in serum. No evidence
of malnutrition was found in these children and present IQ_ tests showed that none was testing retarded
or borderline; four were rated as dull normal and nine were normal.
Speculation
The possibility is raised that mental retardation was produced by early malnutrition from too vigorous
application of dietary therapy in phenylketonuria. It is suggested that more liberal diets would
prevent this malnutrition and that despite moderate elevation of phenylalanine levels in serum, ulti￾mate intellectual function will be improved.
Introduction now results in most patients beginning dietary treat￾ment during the first few weeks of life. Little attention
Many favorable reports have been published on the has been paid to the hazards of feeding a synthetic low
value of a low phenylalanine diet in the treatment of phenylalanine diet to young infants although at least
phenylketonuria (PKU) [2, 3, 8, 15,20, 34, 38, 39,41]. seven deaths [6, 21, 23, 24, 31, 48, 53] associated with,

red cell precursors in the bone marrow [35, 57], mega￾loblastic anemia [53], hypoglycemia [21, 23], hypo￾proteinemia [32], 'phenylalanine deficiency syndrome'
[11, 52, 63], poor weight gain [43, 63], cutaneous
lesions [52, 63], and impaired antibody responses [62].
A number of authors admit that weight gain and
linear growth of their treated patients has been re￾tarded [1, 6, 13, 35, 41, 57], while others state that
these indices have been maintained within the normal
range [7, 8, 32, 61]. Though it has been reported that
untreated patients with phenylketonuria are small in
stature [27, 36, 45], no data have been presented to
support this claim and others have even challenged
this statement [26, 56].
ROUSE [52] described two infants, erroneously fed
a low phenylalanine diet on the basis of false positive
screening tests, who later developed the 'phenyl￾alanine deficiency syndrome'. They were subsequently
found not to have phenylketonuria and were returned
to a normal diet. Despite improvement in nutritional
status, their intellectual progress has so far remained
slow.
In 1963-1965, a number of reports suggested that
malnutrition in the first 6 months of life resulted in
permanent subnormal mentality despite correction of
the malnutrition [12, 17, 18, 55, 60]. Malnutrition in
older children, however, did not induce this permanent
brain damage. We became concerned that these find￾ings might apply to our young (under 6 months) in￾fants receiving dietary treatment for PKU.
Evidence that malnutrition in the first 6 months of
life may produce permanent subnormal mentality
continues to accumulate [67, 68].
In late 1965, we became dissatisfied with the pro￾gress of our patients who had received early treatment
for phenylketonuria. Nearly all had poor weight gain
and linear growth despite diets that maintained the
phenylalanine levels in serum at concentrations con￾sidered adequate (table I). The intelligence quotients
were not as high as expected. Three patients developed
profound malnutrition before 6 months of age. We
wondered if our treatment was producing permanent
mental retardation due to malnutrition caused by too
vigorous restriction of phenylalanine and protein dur￾ing the early months of life.
This paper presents data on 32 patients in whom
dietary therapy was started prior to 6 months of age
and who are now 2 years of age or over.
Materials and Methods
Dietary treatment of phenylketonuria was started in
our clinic in 1958; at present we have in our care 89
patients, the 32 reported in this paper, 46 in whom
dietary treatment was not started until after 6 months
of age, and 11 who are at present too young (under 2
years) for adequate DQjIQ, assessment. During the
early stages of therapy, patients on diet therapy were
seen in the clinic every 1 or 2 weeks. The interval was
gradually extended to every 2 or 3 months in the older
child, depending on their control and response to treat￾ment.
Urine Phenistix [69] and Guthrie tests [28] using
heel-prick blood, as well as determination of quanti￾tative serum phenylalanine levels by the fluorometric
method of MCGAMAN and ROBBINS [42] were perform￾ed at each visit (before 1963 the method of UDENFRIEND
and COOPER [64,65] was used). For the past 18 months,
parents have cooperated by collecting blood speci￾mens for Guthrie tests twice weekly at home. In addi￾tion, levels of hemoglobin and serum proteins were
determined and long bone roentgenograms, and other
appropriate investigations were performed at various
intervals. The parents and patients were interviewed
by a nurse, a dietitian, a psychologist, and a pediatri￾cian during each visit. Psychological tests used were
the Cattell, the Stanford-Binet, and the Wechsler
scales [70].
From 1958 to 1963, the aim of our treatment was
to maintain the fasting phenylalanine levels in serum
within the normal range of 1-3 mg/100 ml; from 1963
to 1965 we allowed values up to 5 mg/100 ml. Early
studies [46] had suggested that the intake of 25 mg
phenylalanine/kg/24 h provided by Lofenalac [71]
alone would be sufficient to maintain these levels and
at the same time allow for optimal growth, but we
found that at least 50 mg phenylalanine/kg/24 h,
obtained by adding small amounts of whole milk, were
always necessary in young infants. Despite monitoring
the phenylalanine levels in serum every 1-2 weeks in
the early months, great difficulty was found in pre￾venting intermittent low phenylalanine readings.
Growth was not satisfactory.
Because of our observations in these early patients,
we changed our treatment in late 1965 to allow fasting
phenylalanine levels in serum between 5 and 15 mg/
100 ml. Most concentrations are now between 8 and
12 mg/100 ml. This was achieved by providing 50-100
mg phenylalanine/kg/24 h during year 1 of life.
Results
The 32 cases in this study can be considered conven￾iently in three groups (table I). Group 1, 3 infants who
manifested profound malnutrition during the early
treatment period; group 2, 16 infants, most of whom
showed less severe but nevertheless definite and pro￾longed evidence of malnutrition; and group 3, 13 in-

fants diagnosed within the past 3.5 years, who have
been given more liberal allowances of phenylalanine
and protein in their diets. In these we have found little
evidence of malnutrition.
Group 1
Case no. 1 (DJ). This infant had a positive Guthrie
screening test at 4 days of age; at 2 weeks of age, the
phenylalanine level in serum was 82 mg/100 ml. She
was fed a diet of Lofenalac and whole milk to provide
50 mg phenylalanine/kg/24 h and was discharged
from the hospital at 1 month of age with a phenylala￾nine level of 9.6 mg/100 ml.
She was readmitted at 3 months of age with anore￾xia, vomiting, diarrhea, and poor weight gain (fig. 1).
At this time she was receiving 35 mg phenylalanine/kg/
24 h. This was gradually increased to 60 mg/kg/24 h.
She became dehydrated and was in a state of electro￾lyte imbalance. Protein levels in serum fell to 3.72 g/
100 ml (albumin 1.14g/100ml, globulin2.58g/100 ml)
and her hemoglobin level dropped to 9.5 g/100 ml
despite supplemental iron. Long bone roentgenograms
revealed osteoporosis, metaphyseal cupping with spi￾cules, and marginal beaking. Her condition continued
to deteriorate and at 4 months of age she was fed whole
milk for a 2 -week period. During this time phenylalanine
concentration rose to 30 mg/100 ml, all clinical symp￾toms disappeared, and serum electrolyte, proteins, and
hemoglobin levels gradually returned to normal.

At the end of this period, a low phenylalanine diet
was reinstituted providing 100 mg phenylalanine/kg/
24 h. She has remained well and maintains phenyl￾alanine concentrations in serum from 5 to 10 mg/100
ml. Her most recent IQ,, at 3 years of age, was 86.
Case no. 2 (TRu). This patient, the sibling of a child
with phenylketonuria, had phenylalanine levels in
serum of 18 and 36 mg/100 ml on days 4 and 5 of life.
He was fed a diet containing 25 mg phenylalanine/kg/
24 h and 4 weeks later the phenylalanine was increased
to 50 mg/kg/24 h. Despite this increase he did poorly.
During the first 8 months of his life he suffered from
recurrent febrile episodes and required hospitalization
three times. At 6 months of age he was admitted with
vomiting, diarrhea, lethargy, skin rash, anorexia, and
edema. Protein levels in serum were 3.82 g/100 ml
(albumin 1.49 g/100 ml, globulin 2.33 g/100 ml) and
the hemoglobin level was 7.8 g/100 ml. Roentgeno￾grams of hands, wrists, and knees showed mild osteo￾porosis, cupping and lipping, and metaphyseal spicule
formation in the radius and ulna (fig. 2). When fed a
diet containing 75 mg phenylalanine/kg/24 h he grad￾ually improved. His most recent IQ,,at 6 years of age,
was 50. The home situation was poor in this family and
may well have been an additional contributing factor
to his poor development.
Case no.3 (CW). Phenylketonuria was detected at
2 months of age and she was fed a diet providing 40 mg
phenylalanine/kg/24 h. Her growth and development
appeared satisfactory until 6 months of age when she
suddenly developed a rash, edema, and failed to gain
weight. Levels of protein in serum were 3.8 g/100 ml
(albumin 1.5 g/100 ml, globulin 2.3 g/100 ml) and
phenylalanine concentrations ranged from 1 to 1.8 mg/
100 ml. She had hypochromic anemia with a hemo￾globin of 6.5 g/100 ml. Roentgenograms revealed
diffuse osteoporosis of radius and ulna with typical
spicular changes. The dietary phenylalanine was in￾creased to 75 mg and later to 100 mg /kg/24 h and at the
end of 2 weeks the level of proteins in serum had risen
to 5.2 g/100 ml and hemoglobin to 8.2 g/100 ml. She
improved gradually and her most recent IQ,, at
4 years of age, was 80.
Group 2
These infants showed less profound but definite evi￾dence of malnutrition; therefore, alerted by our experi￾ence with the infants of group 1, we looked, retro￾spectively, in 1965, at the remainder of our children
with phenylketonuria in whom treatment was started
early in life. Group 2 comprises the remaining 16 in￾fants treated prior to 6 months of age up to late 1965.
Evidence of malnutrition in early infancy in these
16 patients was revealed by the following (table I):
1) Growth retardation (defined here as weight and
height curves dropping below the 3rd percentile in
year 1 of life, or a drop of 25 or more percentile points
during this period), exhibited by 13 of 16 patients in
this group (fig. 3). 2) Episodes of vomiting, diarrhea
[10], anorexia, and unexplained fever found in 9 of
the 16 children. 3) Hypoproteinemia, in two of four
patients studied. 4) Seven of nine tested had refractory
anemia. 5) Fasting blood sugars were measured in four

Malnutrition in early treated phenylketonuria 323
infants on six occasions; all were normal. Extensive
investigations neither of levels of serum proteins and
amino acids nor of bone marrow were performed.
6) The most striking and consistent findings aside from
growth failure were the roentgenographic changes
(fig. 4). In three children no roentgenograms were
made until they were 2.5 years of age or older. At this
time, X-ray films showed only lines of growth retarda￾tion in two, and retarded bone age in one. Of the
remaining 13 patients, a) 4 had metaphyseal spicules
[25, 26], b) 10 had osteoporosis, c) 4 had retarded
bone age, d) 4 had lines of growth retardation, and
e) X-ray films made at the time of diagnosis (i.e.,
before treatment) in 12 children were normal. In short,
all but three of group 2 had roentgenographic evidence
of osteoporosis with or without other bony changes
during year 1 of life. Review of all phenylalanine deter￾minations in serum during year 1 of life showed that
14% were less than 1 mg/100 ml; 66% were between
1 and 4 mg/100 ml; and 20% were over 4 mg/100 ml
(also see table I).
When these moderately malnourished infants be￾came older the problems of anemia, diarrhea, and
vomiting resolved without special treatment and the
roentgenographic changes gradually disappeared.
Weight gain and linear growth improved, so that by
2 years of age most had reached at least the lower range
of normal for age. Phenylalanine requirements changed
at age 18-24 months to 25-30 mg/kg/24 h.
At present, the 16 patients of group 2 are 3-11 years
old and recent IQ_ testing has shown 2 to be in the nor￾mal range, 6 dull normal, 5 borderline and 3 retarded
(table II). The diagnosis of phenylketonuria was de￾layed in two (PF and TRo) of the three retarded
children. One child (PF), in whom the condition was
not diagnosed until 4 months of age, now has an IO_of
40. He may have suffered intrauterine brain damage
as his mother is a homozygous phenylketonuric.
Group 3
As a result of the findings in groups 1 and 2, we
changed our treatment in late 1965 to allow fasting
phenylalanine levels in serum to be maintained be￾tween 5 and 15 mg/100 ml. This required the provision
of 50-100 mg phenylalanine/kg/24 h during year 1
of life.
With this more liberal diet, 2 of the 13 patients in
group 3 have shown roentgenographic changes but
none have had hypoproteinemia or anemia. Two have
had brief episodes of deficient growth and one has had
episodes of diarrhea and anorexia quickly corrected
by dietary adjustments (usually made by adding more
whole milk to the formula preparation).
Intelligence quotient testing of patients in group 3,
at age 25-36 months, show nine normal, four dull
normal, no borderline, and no retarded children
(table II).
The improved results in these patients must be
interpreted with caution for several reasons. The IQ,
of the patients in group 3, still only 25-36 months of

age, may not be predictably valid. The average age
of diagnosis of the patients in group 3 was less than
those in groups 1 and 2, and 5 of the 13 infants in
group 3 are mild (atypical) phenylketonurics needing
only moderate dietary restriction. Indeed two of them,
25 and 33 months of age, respectively, are now fed an
unrestricted diet, and have blood phenylalanine levels
ranging from 8 to 18 mg/100 ml. These five mild
'atypical' patients, however, do not fulfill the present
criteria for atypical PKU (i.e., initial phenylalanine
values in serum of never over 20 mg/100 ml [32]) as
their initial levels were all over 30 mg/100 ml (31.8-
38.5 mg/100 ml).
Discussion
Of the three children showing major manifestations of
malnutrition, two suffered only for relatively brief
periods and malnutrition was quickly corrected. The
subsequent progress of these two has been fairly satis￾factory. Their intelligence so far is in the low normal
range. The third patient in group 1, TRu, had a more
prolonged and recurring problem (fig. 1) with mal￾nutrition and at present has an IQ, of 50, at 6 years of
age. His sibling, in whom the diagnosis was made at
2 months of age, has an IQ,of 74 at 7 years of age. Two
similar cases have been described in the literature [4,
57].
The 16 infants in group 2, though less seriously
affected, usually had evidences of prolonged nutri￾tional deprivation shown chiefly in their growth charts
and roentgenograms (figs. 2 and 3).
HOLT and ALLEN [30], in a study of 32 children who
were treated for phenylketonuria, noted osteoporosis
in one-half and retarded skeletal maturation in one￾third. Twelve of their cases under 3 years of age had
bony spicules, nine of these patients were under 1 year
of age.
That malnutrition in early infancy causes permanent
intellectual deficiency [12, 17, 18, 55, 60] is so far only
speculation. We cannot prove that the malnourished
state produced in the young infants we fed phenyl￾alanine-restricted diets has been harmful. A false
diagnosis of phenylketonuria in a number of infants
led to their being fed low phenylalanine diets for
periods of 12-24 months [4, 11, 16, 52, 54]. Mental
development in some of these children has been re￾tarded. It is possible that this is due to iatrogenic mal￾nutrition in the early months of life.
Experimental work has shown that poor myeliniza￾tion, one of the pathological findings resulting from
malnutrition, can be produced by subjecting animals
to minimal degrees of malnutrition during the period
of maximum myelinization [19]. Also, nutritional de￾privation during the early life of a rat is associated with
a decreased synthesis of sulfatide (a component of
myelin) and this decreased synthesis is not corrected
by refeeding [14].
BESSMAN [6] has pointed out that a much larger
number of untreated phenylketonurics than originally
estimated may have normal intelligence. Since severe
degrees of malnutrition in infancy may cause perma￾nent intellectual deficit, care should be exercised in
controlling the phenylalanine levels in serum to avoid
producing malnutrition lest the treatment be as dam￾aging as the disease.
During the early history of dietary therapy, some
authors [46] suggested that 25 mg phenylalanine/kg/
24 h were sufficient to maintain normal blood levels
and also normal growth in young infants with phenyl￾ketonuria. This has proved fallacious and most work￾ers now recommend an intake of at least 50 mg/kg/24 h
in the early months of life. Our experience indicates
that even this figure is often too low and that 50-100
mg/kg/24 h (and occasionally 125 mg) is necessary.
These figures are similar to the minimal phenylalanine
requirements for normal growth in nonphenylketon￾uric infants which were shown by SNYDERMAN and
HOLT [58] to be 47-90 mg/kg/24 h. The average nor-

Malnutrition in early treated phenylketonuria 325
mal 5-kg infant actually receives about 300-350 mg
phenylalanine/kg/24 h in the usual cows milk formula
with added cereal and strained foods.
Infants fed on a wholly synthetic diet do not grow
and thrive [58]. Cell growth is inhibited if the diet is
low in any single essential amino acid [22]. Since whole
milk must always be added to a Lofenalac diet during
the first 6-12 months of life to maintain a good nutri￾tional state, it is possible that this product is deficient
in some yet undetermined nutrient.
There is some indirect evidence that levels of serum
phenylalanine of up to 10-15 mg/100 ml may not be
harmful to young infants. As yet, mental retardation
in children with untreated transient hyperphenyl￾alaninemia has not been reported. Gross disruption of
related amino acids and metabolites does not occur
until the phenylalanine levels in serum are over 12—15
mg/100 ml. Many of the untreated phenylketonurics
with a high IQ, have relatively low phenylalanine
levels [33] and a number of these individuals have
given birth to normal children.
For these reasons we have permitted phenylalanine
levels in serum to reach 10-15 mg/100 ml without
being concerned. Perhaps as PARTINGTON [49] suggests,
the virtue of a low phenylalanine diet in the treatment
of phenylketonuria lies not so much in maintaining
normal levels of phenylalanine in the blood but in
avoiding gross elevations.
In our 32 patients with phenylketonuria, diagnosed
and treated prior to 6 months of age, we were unable,
with the therapeutic diet used, to maintain the fasting
phenylalanine levels at, or slightly above, the normal
range and at the same time avoid definite clinical,
laboratory, and radiological signs of malnutrition
during year 1 of life. It is possible that permanent
intellectual impairment was produced as a result of
this malnutrition. We suggest that malnutrition can
be avoided by allowing more liberal amounts of
protein and phenylalanine in the diet and that the
resulting moderate elevations of phenylalanine pro￾duced no impairment of intellect. We also suggest that
it is most important to monitor the phenylalanine
levels in serum once or twice weekly during the first
6-12 months of life, and also to watch for evidence of
malnutrition in roentgenograms, serum protein levels,
hemoglobin values, and growth and height gains.
More refined techniques for the evaluation of nutri￾tion, such as measurements of hydroxyprolines in
urine [66] and growth hormone studies [50], might
also be of value in assessing the efficacy of the dietary
treatment of this condition.
Summary
Studies of 32 patients with phenylketonuria, in whom
dietary treatment was started before 6 months of age,
are reported.'
Evidence of profound malnutrition during year 1
of life was found in 3 cases, and less severe but prolong￾ed malnutrition was found in most of the patients from
a group of 16 despite phenylalanine levels in serum
that were within the normal ranges.
In 13 cases that were recently diagnosed, more
liberal amounts of phenlyalanine and protein were
given that resulted in moderate elevations of phenyl￾alanine levels. No evidence of malnutrition was found
in these children, and their present IQ, test scores are
higher than those of the children who were fed the
more restricted diets.
The possibility is raised that mental retardation was
produced by early malnutrition from too vigorous
application of dietary therapy.
