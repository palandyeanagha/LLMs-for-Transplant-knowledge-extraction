Gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) and microaspiration are
implicated in the pathophysiology of asthma, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, interstitial lung disease and chronic lung
allograft dysfunction.1 2 Aspiration, which is often asymptomatic,


has been identified as a treatable allograft injury that may affect
mortality.1 2
The potential for thoracic mechanical changes caused by advanced
lung disease to predispose to reflux has been highlighted.2
Although aspiration could cause lung damage, alternatively reflux
might represent a secondary event. Longitudinal data are lacking,2
so we have undertaken a prospective study of reflux in lung
transplantation. This allowed investigations in patients where
thoracic mechanical changes associated with advanced lung disease
had improved. We hypothesised that reflux was prevalent and could
develop at different times following transplantation in patients with
good allograft function.
