Abstract
Background-6-Mercaptopurine (6-MP)
has confirmed short and longterm efficacy
in the treatment of IBD. However, the
relation between its metabolism, efficacy,
and side effects is not well understood.
Aims-To assay 6-MP metabolites and to
correlate levels with drug compliance,
disease activity, and adverse effects of
treatment.
Patients-Heparinised blood was obtained
prior to daily administration of6-MP in 25
adolescent Crohn's disease patients (14
ileocolitis, 11 colitis) receiving 1.2 (range
0.4-1.6) mglkg/day for a mean of 17 (range
4-65) months.
Methods-Erythrocyte free bases 6-thio￾guanine (6-TG) and 6-methyl-mercapto￾purine (6-MMP) were measured (pmol/
8X 108 red blood cells) using reverse phase
high performance liquid chromatography.
Results-Disease activity (modified
Harvey-Bradshaw index) improved signi￾ficantly with 6-MP (p=0.001). Clinical
remission was achieved in 72% ofpatients,
who stopped taking prednisone, or were
successfully weaned to a low alternate day
dose (<0.4 mglkg/OD). Remission corre￾lated weli with erythrocyte 6-TG (p<0.05),
but not 6-MMP levels. Neutropenia was
associated with 6-MP use (p<0.005), but
did not correlate with erythrocyte 6-MP
metabolite levels. One patient refractory
to 6-MP had 6-TG, but no measureable
6-MMP production, suggesting deficient
thiopurine methyl-transferase activity or
poor compliance. 6-MP induced compli￾cations (hepatitis, pancreatitis, and
marrow suppression) were generally asso￾ciated with increased 6-MMP levels.
Conclusions-These results suggest that
high performance liquid chromatography
measurement oferythrocyte 6-MP metab￾olites may provide a quantitative assess￾ment of patient responsiveness and com￾pliance to treatment. The data support an
immunosuppressive role for 6-TG, and
potential cytotoxicity of raised 6-MMP
levels.

6-Mercaptopurine (6-MP) and its parent drug
azathioprine are well known for their immuno￾suppressive and lymphocytotoxic properties.'
Consequently, these drugs are increasingly
used in the treatment of corticosteroid depen￾dent inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).' 2
6-MP eliminates the need for corticosteroids in
about 75% of patients, with a median response
time of three to four months.3' Furthermore,
when combined with prednisone, azathioprine
has recently been shown to induce remission
faster, more frequently, and at a lower corti￾costeroid dose than prednisone alone.3 These
immunosuppressants have also been shown to
improve Crohn's disease patients' quality of
life by decreasing symptoms from their
perianal disease.4 However, potential compli￾cations of treatment exist, including allergic
reactions, neoplasia, superinfections, hepatitis,
bone marrow suppression, and pancreatitis.'
Furthermore, not all patients respond
favourably, raising the possibility that altered
drug metabolism or patient compliance affect
efficacy and toxicity.3-7
The immunosuppressive properties of 6-MP
and azathioprine are most probably mediated
via their interference with protein synthesis
and nucleic acid metabolism in the sequence
that follows antigen stimulation, as well as by
their cytotoxic effects on lymphoid cells.8 9
This direct cytotoxicity against lymphoid cells
is the basis for their use in the treatment of
lymphoma and leukaemia.'0 As 6-MP is not
active, it must be transformed intracellularly
into a ribonucleotide, which functions as a
purine antagonist. However, 6-MP undergoes
rapid and extensive catabolic oxidation to
6-thiouric acid in the intestinal mucosa and
liver by the enzyme xanthine oxidase (Fig 1).9
As proof, the absolute bioavailability of 6-MP
ranges from 5-37O/o.ll The anabolic transfor￾mation of 6-MP into active metabolites occurs
intracellularly along the competing routes
catalysed by thiopurine methyl-transferase
(TPMT) and hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl
transferase (HPRT), giving rise to 6-methyl￾mercaptopurine (6-MMP), 6-methyl-thioino￾sine 5'-monophosphate (6-Me-tIMP), and
6-thioguanine nucleotides (6-TG), respect￾ively (Fig 1).
An apparent genetic polymorphism has been
observed in TPMT activity. Negligible activity
was noted in 0 3%, and low activities in 1 1O%
of subjects.'2 13 Indeed, low TPMT activity has
been associated with increased cytotoxicity, by
allowing 6-MP metabolism to be shunted
towards the excessive production of 6-TG
nucleotides.'3 To date however, no studies have
examined 6-MP metabolism in IBD patients to
correlate dose responsiveness to outcome and
toxicity. In view of recent reports showing a
low, but non-negligeable incidence of toxicity
with these drugs in IBD patients,' we
hypothesised that altered TPMT activity may

explain the refractoriness or toxicity, or both, to
6-MP or azathioprine. The aim of this study
was therefore to assay the 6-MP metabolites
6-TG and 6-MMP, and to correlate their intra￾cellular levels with drug efficacy and toxicity.
Methods
Patients
Adolescent Crohn's disease patients receiving
longterm treatment with 6-MP (>4 months)
followed up at the paediatric IBD Clinic at Ste
Justine's Hospital were recruited for study.
Entry criteria included Crohn's disease estab￾lished by standard clinical, radiological, and
histological findings and corticosteroid depen￾dent or refractory disease.' At the time of study
entry, the attending paediatric gastroenterologist
performed a complete history and physical
examination. Data were collected to complete a
modified Harvey-Bradshaw index (HBI) of
disease activity,' 4 as follows: (a) presence of
constitutional signs (anorexia, fatigue, fever
(score 1 per item)); (b) abdominal pain
(1 =mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe); (c) abdominal
mass (1=dubious, 2=definite, 3=definite and
tender); (d) stool pattern (number of liquid
stools >3/day, presence of urgency, tenesmus or
blood (score 1 per item)), and (e) complications
(articular, cutaneous, erythema nodosum,
aphthous ulcers, pyoderma gangrenosum),
ophthalmological, (uveitis), presence of fistula,
abscess or fissure (score 1 per item). The
maximum score obtainable was 20.
For the purposes of this study, successful
remission with 6-MP was defined as an HBI of
less than 5, in patients who were stable without
corticosteroids, or weaned to a low dose of
prednisone (<0 4 mg/kg/OD). An HBI less
than 5 correlates with a paediatric Crohn's
disease activity index (P-CDAI) below 150,
considered quiescent disease.'1416 The dur￾ation, dosage, and side effects of 6-MP were
recorded for each patient undergoing 6-MP
metabolite measurement. Each patient's HBI
and laboratory date (white blood cell, haemo￾globin, and serum albumin) were recorded and
compared before and with 6-MP treatment.
Drug related side effects were compared with
respect to individual metabolite levels. As well,
all concurrent medications were tabulated at
the time of the patients' visit to clinic. Patients
with 6-MP related complications had 6-MP
metabolite levels measured in clinic prior to
discontinuing 6-MP treatment. Informed
consent was obtained prior to study entry.
Blood sampling
Heparinised blood samples (5-10 ml) were
obtained immediately prior to the daily
administration of 6-MP, so as to measure pre￾dose drug metabolite activities. After washing
with phosphate buffered saline, red blood cells
were centrifuged (1000 g, 5 min) and their
numbers were determined from an aliquot.
The packed red blood cells were frozen at
-20°C until assayed.
6-MP metabolite assay
The determination of red blood cell free thio￾purines 6-TG, 6-MP, and 6-MMP was based
on a slight modification of a reversed phase
high performance liquid chromatography assay
developed by Lennard and Singleton.'7 In this
assay, the nucleoside and nucleotide mono-,

6-MP metabolism in IBD
di-, and triphosphate moieties are hydrolysed
back to their respective thiobases. Briefly,
thawed red blood cells were mixed well, and a
100 pl aliquot was added to 500 pl water and
300 ,ul DL- dithiotreitol (10 mM). To this was
added 500 plI sulphuric acid (1-5 M), and the
tubes were heated at 100°C for three hours in
a dry bath incubator (Fisher Scientific). After
cooling, 500 pl of 3.4 sodium hydroxide was
added, followed by 4 ml of 1mM phenyl￾mercuric chloride in methylene chloride. After
gentle shaking for 10 minutes and centri￾fugation, the organic layer was back extracted
with 200 gl of 0.1 N hydrochloric acid. For
6-TG and 6-MP determination, 100 pI of the
acidic extract was injected through a 506
autosampler (Beckman) onto a Waters Nova￾Pak C18 column (3.9X 150 mm). The analytical
column was protected by an in line filter (0.45
,um, SSI). The parent 6-TG and 6-MP were
detected using a programmable detector
module 166 (Beckman) set at 342 nm and the
chromatographic traces were stored on a
microcomputer for further analysis using
System Gold software (Beckman). A Model
126 programmable solvent module (Beckman)
was used for solvent delivery. The mobile
phase consisted of water containing 50 mM
orthophosphoric and 0.5 mM DL-dithio￾treitol. For 6-MMP determination, 50 gl ofthe
acidic extract was processed as indicated above
with the following modifications: the wave￾length was set at 314 nm, the mobile phase of
methanol:water (4:96, v/v) contained 150 mM
triethylamine and 0.5 mM DL-dithiotreitol,
and was adjusted to pH 3-2 with ortho￾phosphoric acid. Under these conditions, the
percentage of recovery for 6-TG or 6-MP was
over 85%, with a coefficient of variation of less
than 10%. Calibration curves were linear with
correlation coefficients of 0.998 for 6-TG and
0.999 for 6-MP and 6-MMP. The limit of
quantification was 35 pmo1/8X 108 red blood
cells for 6-TG, and 50 pmolI8X 108 red blood
cells for 6-MMP. The reproducibility of the
assay was evaluated by the intra-assay co￾efficient of variation, which was less than 4%.
Statistical methods
Non-parametric statistical analyses comparing
6-MP metabolite values to the patients' re￾spective HBI of disease activity were per￾formed using the Spearman rank correlation
coefficient. HBI of disease activity and corti￾costeroid dose before and with 6MP treatment
were compared with the Sign test. Laboratory
data (white blood cell, haemoglobin, and
serum albumin) were compared before and
with 6-MP treatment by the paired Student t
test. x2 Analysis was used to find out if con￾comitant drug treatment influenced 6-MP
metabolite activities.
Analysis of 6-MP metabolites was performed
once the assay was established and validated,
at the time of a clinic visit with other routine
blood testing. They had received an average of
1-2 mg/kg/day of 6-MP (range 0-4-1-6) for a
mean of 17 months (range 4-65). Ileocolitis
was present in 14, and colitis in 11 patients.
Overall, remission was achieved in 72% of
patients taking 6-MP, when analysed on an
intent to treat basis. This included 7 1/% and
73% of patients with ileocolitis and colitis,
respectively. A criteria of successful remission
in this study included the tapering of
prednisone to < 0.4 mg/kg/OD.
The HBI of disease activity improved signifi￾cantly (p=0.001) with the use of 6-MP (Fig 2).
A significant reduction in corticosteroid dose
was accomplished, from a mean of 0 53 to 0.20
mg/kg/day, (p<0.01). A comparison of before
and with 6-MP haemoglobin (1 19.4 (2.9),
123.9 (4.3) g/l) and serum albumin (40.3
(1.5). 40.7 (0.8) g/1) values did not show any
significant changes.
Disease activity and 6-MP metabolite values
Native 6-MP was detectable in just three
patients, and only in negligible quantities.
Median erythrocyte 6-TG and 6-MMP levels
(pmol/8X 108 red blood cells (range)) were 254
(64-1038) and 3486 (0-16 312), respectively.
6-TG values did not correlate with 6-MMP
levels, as measured by the Spearman rank
correlation coefficient, (Fig 3). In 15 patients,
serial 6-TG activities were measured on the
same dose of 6-MP, after a delay of 2-24
months. Initial median (range) 6-TG levels
(326 (126-452)) showed no significant varia￾bility when compared with follow up (263
(131-465)). Patients receiving sulphasalazine
or related salicylates (5-ASA) did not show
6-TG levels significantly above the median (X2
analysis, data not shown).
Erythrocyte 6-TG levels showed a significant
(p<005) inverse correlation with the HBI of
disease activity (Fig 4). On the other hand,
values of 6-MMP did not correlate significantly
with the HBI. However, the patient with the
highest index of disease activity had un￾detectable levels of 6-MMP. A 6-MMP level of
zero in a patient who is taking the drug, as
confirmed by measureable 6-TG levels (Fig 3),

marrow uptake, it serves to estimate the levels
of leucocyte incorporation and thus immuno￾suppression. The measure of leucocyte 6-TG
levels would theoretically allow a stronger
correlation to be drawn with clinical respon￾siveness. Alternatively, as the course of
Crohn's disease is extremely variable, we
cannot assume that the absence of disease
activity is due to the use of 6-MP, despite its
known efficacy.27
In one male adolescent, non-compliance was
suspected in view of very low 6-TG levels
(<75) on two separate occasions, with a high
HBI (>9). Although the patient had initially
denied poor compliance, he subsequently
confirmed this suspicion when confronted with
the pharmacological data. This case illustrates
the utility of measuring 6-TG bases (including
nucleoside and nucleotide moities) to verify
patient compliance to treatment. Further
prospective studies are needed to also confirm
whether physicians may be able to individually
tailor 6-MP dose, to achieve specific thera￾peutic metabolite ranges.
Median 6-TG levels in IBD patients were
slightly lower than those we have seen in
children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia
receiving 6-MP either orally (50 mg/m2/day)
for 14 days, or as an intravenous (50 mg/m2/h)
20 hour infusion.2' It has been shown that a
steady state is achieved after continuous daily
administration of 6-MP for more than two
months.22 In this study, serial measurements of
red blood cell 6-TG concentrations performed
in 15 Crohn's disease patients, showed no
significant variability over time, in contrast
with the study by Zimm et al.
6-MMP metabolite levels did not correlate
with disease activity, probably because of the
wide range of values detected. The large vari￾ation seen from the median in 6-MMP level is
probably a consequence of the genetic poly￾morphism of TPMT activity in the population
studied, as well as the unequal dose of drug
taken by patients. It remains unclear whether
intracellular levels of 6-MMP and 6-TG vary
accordingly with variations in TPMT activity.
Our study did not show a correlation between
erythrocyte 6-TG and 6-MMP levels. Simi￾larly, erythrocyte 6-MMP levels did not
correlate with 6-TG levels in our leukaemic
children receiving maintenance 6-MP treat￾ment, (unpublished data). Interestingly, the
patient with the highest index of disease
activity had no measureable 6-MMP, with
6-TG levels below the collective group median.
As undetectable 6-MMP levels may be
indicative of absent or decreased TPMT
activity, an increase in her 6-TG levels would
have been expected. Indeed, a patient with
TPMT deficiency showed myelosuppression
and elevated 6-TG levels even at a much
reduced 6-MP dose.23 Although the measure of
erythrocyte 6-MMP is a sensitive indicator of
TPMT activity, the quantitation of genetic
polymorphisms in TPMT activity is best
identified through direct enzymatic measure of
activity. This patient's refractoriness to 6-MP
treatment despite 6-TG values near the
median observed within the study group raises
the possibility of sub-optimal 6-MP dose (0-8
mg/kg/day), non-compliance or an immuno￾suppressive role for 6-MMP metabolites. The
principal transformation product measured by
the high performance liquid chromatography
technique is likely to be 6-Me-tIMP, a strong
inhibitor of phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate
amidotransferase, the first enzyme in purine de
novo synthesis.24 Recent data using the human
lymphoblastic T cell line showed that inhi￾bition of de novo purine synthesis by 6-Me￾tIMP was a crucial event in the mechanism of
6-MP induced cytotoxicity.25 The therapeutic
importance of methylated 6-MP metabolites in
Crohn's disease requires further study.
Complications of 6-MP treatment were seen
in 24% of our patients, clearly higher than that
previously reported in the literature.' This
discrepancy is a consequence of a selection bias
in the adolescent IBD population studied, as
patients suspected of toxicity to 6-MP were
preferentially refered for our metabolite assay.
Four patients had pancreatitis (only one of
whom was symptomatic), one other case each
had drug induced hepatitis or bone marrow
suppression. The dose of 6-MP used was not
different from the group of patients without
complications. As noted above, 6-MMP was
not detected in one of the four patients with
pancreatitis. In contast, the remaining five
patients with drug induced complications had
very high 6-MMP activities and comparably
lower 6-TG levels. Despite these 6-MP related
complications, these patients were in clinical
remission. Overall, our data support a per￾missive role for high methylated 6-MP meta￾bolite levels and 6-MP related complications.
However, pancreatitis may ensue despite the
absence of 6-MMP. A larger sample size will
be necessary to draw conclusions about speci￾fic metabolites and 6-MP induced complica￾tions.
It has been suggested that sulphasalazine
and related salicylate compounds have a direct
inhibitory effect on TPMT activity, shunting
6-MP metabolism into 6-TG production, thus
predisposing patients to cytotoxic 6-TG
levels.26 It is thus noteworthy that all patients
with 6-MP related complications were either
taking sulphasalazine or related salicylate com￾pounds. Nevertheless, this group was found to
have somewhat lower erythrocyte 6-TG levels.
6-TG levels were not significantly influenced
by sulphasalazine nor other salicylates in our
study.
As anticipated, neutrophil counts were signi￾ficantly lower after 6-MP treatment (p<0005).
However, severe neutropenia was not seen, nor
were cases of opportunistic infections en￾countered. Leucopenia has been associated

not correlate significantly with the leucocyte
count, in contrast with what has been
described in leukaemic patients treated with
higher 6-MP doses, where
a strong relation has
been shown between 6-MP dose, erythrocyte
6-TG nucleotide levels, and neutropenia.28
Clearly, the treatment of IBD does not
necessitate the same degree of 6-MP induced
leucocytotoxicity required in the treatment of
leukaemia. Future studies are needed to
identify
a therapeutic regimen for 6-MP treat￾ment to better delineate excessive cytotoxicity
from immunosuppression. The measure of
leucocyte 6-TG levels may help improve our
understanding of the beneficial leucocytotoxic
effects of 6-MP in Crohn's disease.
In conclusion, our data suggest that
measurement of erythrocyte 6-MP metabolites
can be useful in treating IBD patients, allowing
for the assessment of compliance and re￾sponsiveness to treatment. As 6-MP has been
shown to induce leucopenia, the measurement
of 6-MP metabolites (6-TG as well as 6-MMP
moieties) in leucocytes may eventually provide
further insight towards establishing
a
mechanism underlying their therapeutic effect.
Our recent preliminary investigative efforts to
measure 6-TG in leucocytes has shown
a
correlation between neutrophil 6-TG levels
and responsiveness to treatment, as well as
drug induced leucopenia.29 Further research is
needed to identify
a therapeutic regimen for
6-MP treatment allowing clinicians to establish a balance between drug responsiveness and
toxicity.
