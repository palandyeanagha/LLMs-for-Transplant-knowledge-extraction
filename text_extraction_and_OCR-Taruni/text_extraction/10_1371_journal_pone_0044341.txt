Abstract
Aims: To assess parental attitudes towards type 1 diabetes clinical trials (T1DCTs) and factors that impact willingness to
enroll their children with and without diabetes.
Methods: A cross-sectional survey of parents of children with type 1 diabetes was administered at an academic clinic and a
diabetes educational event.
Results: Survey response rate was 36%. Of 166 participating parents, 76% were aware of T1DCTs. More parents reported
willingness to enroll children with diabetes (47%) than unaffected children (36%). Only 18% recalled being asked to enroll
their children, and of these, 60% agreed to enroll at least some of those times. Less than 30% were comfortable with
placebos. Factors predicting willingness to enroll children with diabetes included healthcare provider trust, comfort with
consent by proxy, low fear of child being a ‘‘guinea pig,’’ and comfort with placebo. Factors predicting willingness to enroll
unaffected children were provider trust, comfort with consent by proxy, comfort with placebo, and perceived ease of
understanding T1DCT information.
Conclusions: Parents report moderate willingness to enroll children in T1DCTs. Willingness is diminished by common trial
methodologies. Although most parents recalled receiving trial-related information, significantly fewer recalled being asked
to participate. Efforts to optimize effective communication around identified areas of parental concern may increase T1DCT
participation.

Introduction
Clinical trials for type 1 diabetes (T1DCTs) can generate
medical knowledge and improve patient care. However, it remains
challenging to rapidly and optimally enroll target patient numbers
in clinical trials. Trials with fewer than required participants are
less likely to detect smaller, but clinically significant treatment
effects, and are a potential threat to the generalizability of results
[1]. Poor enrollment also leads to delayed trial completion, and
consequently, to delayed knowledge and delivery of novel
treatment approaches [2].
Because most initial T1D diagnoses are made in childhood, the
pediatric population is the primary target for T1DCTs. Recruit￾ment issues may be different for children and adults, and
recruitment of children to clinical trials is thought to be more
difficult [3]. Low accrual rates in pediatric trials relate to doctor,
parent, child, and trial factors [3,4,5]. Some of the challenges arise
because parents must ultimately decide about trial participation on
behalf of their children, adding complexity to the consent process
[3,5]. Additional data suggest that the balance of perceived
benefits, risks and barriers of participation influences parents’
willingness to participate [3,5,6,7].
Much of the research in trial participation has been performed
in cancer, an immediately life-threatening disease. Less is known
about parental attitudes towards enrolling their children in trials
for chronic diseases, particularly type 1 diabetes. Two studies have
examined the views of children themselves toward participation in
T1DCTs, and another study examined how mothers who had
enrolled children in the ABIS Study, a longitudinal research
screening for type 1 diabetes and other multifactorial diseases,
perceived trial-related information and the informed consent
process [8,9,10]. However, little is known about the attitudes of
parents/guardians towards enrolling their affected children and
their children at risk for diabetes, who are also important targets
for T1DCT participation. To identify factors that influence
parents’ decisions to enroll an at-risk or affected child in T1DCTs,
we developed and administered a survey that explores a wide
range of pontential influences over parental attitudes. Enhanced

understanding of perceived barriers and facilitators for enrollment
may aid the design of future studies and recruitment strategies,
thereby optimizing trial participation and study completion.
Results
Demographic and enrollment data
A total of 166 questionnaires were collected, with an overall
response rate of 36%. Of these, 21 questionnaires (12.7%) were
completed during Vanderbilt Diabetes Family Day while the
remainder was collected from clinic visits. Sociodemographic data
of the sample is summarized in Table 1. The majority of parents
who participated in our survey were White (90%) females (81%).
Our overall clinic population (n = 1867) from which this sample
was taken consists of 60% White, 10.4% Black or African
American, 1.6% Hispanic, 0.5% Asian or Pacific Islander, and
27.4% pediatric patients with unknown ethnic background. To
understand how our respondents related to actual clinical trial
participants at our institution, we examined the demographics of
the most recent enrollees at our Clinical Center in the Type 1
Diabetes TrialNet Pathways to Prevention, a longitudinal study of
at-risk relatives of children with diabetes. When we examined
demographics of the most recent 102 TrialNet enrollees younger
than 18 years of age at our institution, a similar 89% were White
and 5% were Black or African American. Most consent forms for
these individuals were signed by mothers or female guardians
(89%).76% of participants were aware that T1DCTs exist and
68% were aware of trials conducted locally. 66% recalled receiving
information about clinical trials, which most often came from
healthcare providers. The majority deemed the information
received to be completely or a great deal easy to understand,
although 38% reported at least some difficulty with comprehen￾sion. Only 18% recalled having been asked specifically to enroll
their child with diabetes or unaffected child into a trial. Of these,
62% and 60% agreed to enroll their child with diabetes and
unaffected child, respectively, at least some of the time. Parents
reported slightly higher willingness to enroll children with diabetes
(WTEDC, 47%) compared to unaffected children (WTEnDC,
36%). Most parents (81%) considered their child’s participation in
T1DCTs to be important. 67% disagreed that there is currently
sufficient enrollment in T1DCTs.
Parental Perceptions of Potential Trial Benefits
When asked about motivators for enrollment, most parents
reported that potential benefit for their own child (92%) and for
other children in the future (87%) were important. The
opportunity to contribute to science was a motivator for 43%.
31% were motivated to enroll a child by influences of family and
friends. Financial compensation and increased physician access at
no additional cost were motivators for 32% and 47%, respectively.
Highly desirable benefits of trial participation included findings
ways to cure (91%) and prevent (78%) diabetes, to improve
diabetes control (83%), and to determine risk of diabetes-related
complications (72%). Parents were relatively less interested in trials
designed to prolong the ‘‘honeymoon period (55%),’’ and to
determine the risk of diabetes in unaffected children (49%).
Effect of parent perceptions of risks and consent on
willingness to enroll
A summary of factors perceived to influence parental enroll￾ment decisions can be found in Figure 1. 57% expressed that the
risk of side effects associated with trial participation has a major
influence over enrollment decisions. Notably, 27% of parents
endorsed discomfort with consent by proxy, or making decisions
about trial enrollment on behalf of their children. Some parents
were concerned about potential costs associated with trial
participation –30% of parents expressed fear of having to pay
for research treatment, and 36% stated that the lack or cost of
transportation would influence enrollment decisions. Both fear of
having to pay for research treatment and the self-described
influence of transportation worries correlated with parental
income (r = 20.28 and r = 20.35, respectively; p,0.01.
Specific trial protocol elements, such as placebo and
vaccines, considerably influence parental willingness
Figure 2 shows attitudes towards trial participation in different
scenarios reflecting potential T1DCT protocols. The majority of
parents were completely or a great deal comfortable with enrolling
their children in T1DCTs that involve giving blood with a finger
prick, having blood drawn, and participating in exercises and
interviews (Figure 2a). Conversely, over half of parents expressed
they were only ‘‘a little’’ or ‘‘not at all’’ comfortable with trials
requiring blood transfusions, surgery, or exposure to animal tissue
and human stem cells (Figure 2a). 47% expressed comfort with
trials requiring their child to take oral medications (Figure 2a).
Only 23% of parents were comfortable with the prospect of
their child receiving placebo treatments (Figure 2a). As parents’
income increased, so did comfort with their child receiving
placebos (r = 0.21, p = 0.01). Parents who were comfortable with
placebos tended to be more altruistic, as they were motivated to
enroll their children by the opportunity to contribute to science
and to benefit other children (r = 0.28, p,0.001 and r = 0.2,
p = 0.01, respectively); however, no correlation between comfort
with placebo treatment and motivation to receive benefits for one’s
own child was observed. Parental comfort with placebo did not
correlate with lack of trust in research or with fear of child being a
‘‘guinea pig.’’
Immunomodulatory interventions for type 1 diabetes involving
‘‘vaccines’’ are currently under investigation [11]. Yet, only 29%
of parents are comfortable with enrolling their child in ‘‘vaccine’’
trials (Figure 2a). 19% of parents stated their decision to enroll a
child in studies would be influenced by their child’s fear of
receiving injections (Figure 1). There was a significant negative
correlation between degree of comfort with protocols involving
needles and endorsement of the child’s fear of needles. The
presence of fear of injections in a child negatively correlated with
comfort with vaccines (r = 20.42, p,0.001) and intravenous
injections (r = 20.41, p,0.001).
Comfort with all protocols surveyed positively correlated with
reported willingness to enroll a child with diabetes and a non￾affected child (r = 0.23–0.6, p,0.01). Thus, parental comfort with
the described trial elements was further broken down based on
degree of parental willingness to enroll a child with diabetes in
T1DCTs (Figure 2b and 2c). Breakdown for responses depending
on willingness to enroll an unaffected child are not shown as results
are similar. There were more protocol tasks with which greater
than 60% of parents were comfortable in the group who reported
willingness to enroll, as compared to parents who were less willing
to enroll (Figure 2b and 2c, green boxes). Parents who were willing
to enroll expressed intermediate comfort with several protocol
elements, and were only resistant (less than 30% reported comfort
with these tasks) to a few tasks (Figure 2b, purple box). Conversely,
parents reporting unwillingness to enroll accept only the most
modest protocols, and are unlikely to consider nearly all available
protocols (Figure 2c, purple box), including blood draws, which is
the cornestone of entry into the dominant current diabetes trial,
T1D TrialNet.

Development of a predictive model of willingness to
enroll children with and without T1D
None of the sociodemographic data examined correlated with
willingness to enroll, including parent age, sex, race, level of
education, or income. There was a positive correlation between
the perceived ease of understanding trial information and
willingness to enroll (WTEDC, r = 0.25, p = 0.01; WTEnDC,
r = 0.32, p,0.01).
Parents who reported greater willingness to enroll a child were
less likely to be influenced by fear of side effects (WTEDC,
r = 20.24, p,0.01; WTEnDC, r = 20.24, p = 0.01), and were
more likely to report comfort with all trial-related protocols
surveyed (Figure 2b). Willingness to enroll negatively correlated
with discomfort with consent by proxy (WTEDC, r = 20.42,
p,0.01; WTEnDC, r = 20.36, p,0.01).
The majority of parents (62%) agreed or strongly agreed that
healthcare providers have the best interest of patients in mind
when presenting options to enroll in studies. Trust in healthcare
providers positively correlated with willingness to enroll one’s
children (WTEDC, r = 0.36, p,0.01; WTEnDC, r = 0.33,
p,0.01). Moreover, few participants (11%) expressed that a lack
of trust in research influences their decision of enrollment
decisions. Those who reported trust in research to be an issue
were less likely to be willing to enroll their children in T1DCTs
(WTEDC, r = 20.28, p,0.01; WTEnDC, r = 20.26, p,0.01).
36% of parents revealed that a fear of their child being a ‘‘guinea
pig’’ would influence their decision, which negatively correlated
with willingness to enroll (WTEDC, r = 20.40, p,0.01;
WTEnDC, r = 20.30, p,0.01).
As parents reporting themselves as ‘‘willing to enroll’’ were open
to participation in substantially more protocols, we sought to
define predictors of WTEDC and WTEnDC by fitting ordinal
logistic models. Results are shown in Table 2.
We found that trust in healthcare providers, comfort with
placebo treatment, and lack of fear of one’s child serving as a
‘‘guinea pig’’ for research were significant positive predictors of
parental WTEDC (Table 2). Discomfort with consent by proxy
was a significant negative predictor of WTEDC (Table 2). Trust in
research, fear of side effects associated with research participation,
and perceived ease in understanding trial-related information were
not statistically significant predictors (Table 2).
Although trust in healthcare providers and comfort with
placebo treatment were significant positive predictors of
WTEnDC, the effects were not as strong as for WTEDC
(Table 2). This was similar for degree of comfort with consent
by proxy (Table 2). Unlike the model for WTEDC, parents
regarding T1DCT information they received as being only
somewhat easy to understand were significantly less likely to be
willing to enroll their unaffected children (Table 2). Results were
similar for those who received no information, albeit, the effect
was not as strong (odds ratio 0.4, CI: 0.17–0.97). Factors that did
not predict WTEnDC include degree of trust in research, fear of
side effects, and fear of child serving as a ‘‘guinea pig’’ (Table 2).
Discussion
Most of the parents surveyed (81%) believed their own child’s
participation in T1DCTs is important. Yet, less than 50% were
significantly willing to enroll their children. Although parents
described themselves as being more willing to enroll their children
with diabetes, for the 18% who recalled being approached about
enrollment, acceptance statistics were similar for both children
with and without diabetes.
While most participating parents stated they received informa￾tion about T1DCTs, the majority of parents did not recall being
asked specifically to enroll a child in T1DCTs. It is possible that
providers believed that they asked families, but that the phrasing
was not understood as a specific offer to participate. These findings

suggest that if we can reach the nearly 80% of parents who may
not yet have been approached, patient enrollment in T1DCTs
would increase.
A notable 36% of parents reported that the information they
received about trials was not entirely straightforward, which had
no correlation with parental education level. Perceived degree of
ease required for understanding trial information correlated with
WTEDC and WTEnDC, and it was a predictor for WTEnDC.
Interestingly, a previous report of a screening study for T1D
demonstrated that although a majority of mothers who enrolled
their children were satisfied with the information they received
about the study and regarded themselves as having understood the
information, a significant proportion were either unsure or
disagreed with several of the basic aims of the study [10]. These
findings highlights the importance of dedicating time to explain
the process of trial participation, to answer questions, and to allay
any misconcentions parents may have. It also suggests that
development of specific adjunctive tools, such as scripts, may aid in
communication and recruitment.
Although none of the sociodemographic data examined had a
statistically significant correlation with willingness to enroll,
financial concerns related to trial participation were of signifi￾cance. A significant number of parents expressed worries of having
to pay for research treatments and endorsed that lack or cost of
transportation would influence enrollment decisions. Parents with
lower income were more likely to endorse these concerns. These
concerns may be particularly important in trials involving longer
periods of time away from work and school such as trials with
multi-day infusions. Therefore, when approaching parents about
trial enrollment, it is worthwhile to discuss participation-related
costs, perhaps even in situations where no direct costs are involved.
Concerns about cost or lack of transportation also underscores the
importance of coordinating research activity with regular doctor
visits, and of offering any available assistance to minimize added
financial and commitment burdens associated with trial partici￾pation.
Safety and comfort issues related to trial participation are of
major concern for parents. Those who were more willing to enroll
their children were less likely to be influenced by fear of side effects
or to believe research may harm their children. Parents were less
comfortable with trials involving more invasive, potentially painful
protocols, or those that required tests and treatments that were not

part of routine diabetes care. We found that a child’s fear of
receiving injections had an important influence over enrollment
decisions for nearly 20% of parents. Injection fear in a child made
parents significantly less comfortable with protocols that may be
common aspects of T1DCTs such as blood draws, intravenous
injections, vaccines, and blood transfusions. Nevertheless, inter￾vention-specific fears may also contribute to discomfort with these
protocols. Vaccines, for example, have generated considerable
opposition among the public for complex reasons since their initial
introduction [12].

more about how specific tasks that may be part of a Type 1 diabetes clinical trial may influence your decision to enroll your child. How comfortable

willing to enroll a child with diabetes. Breakdown for reponses depending on willingness to enroll an unaffected child are not shown as results are
similar. Green box highlights tasks with which .60% of all parents were ‘‘a great deal’’ or ‘‘completely’’ comfortable. The purple box highlights tasks
with which ,30% of all parents were ‘‘a great deal’’ or ‘‘completely’’ comfortable. Comfort with all protocols surveyed had a statistically significant
positive correlation with both willingness to enroll a child with diabetes and a non-affected child (r = 0.23–0.6). This effect can be appreciated above
by the larger green and much smaller purple box among parents who reported willingness to enroll their children in T1DCTs.

Several studies have shown that parents generally have a poor
awareness and understanding of pediatric randomized clinical
trials [3,4,5,13,14,15,16]. Importantly, the rationale for the
random allocation of treatment and the use of placebo is generally
poorly understood not only by parents, but also by adult patients,
adult physicians, and pediatricians [3,4]. The implication is that
the presence of randomization and a placebo group, integral
aspects of high quality research, are often barriers to participation
[3,5,17]. Results from our study agree with these reports. Only a
minority of parents were comfortable with the possibility of their
child being randomised to a placebo arm. Comfort with placebos
had a strong positive correlation with and was predictive of
willingness to enroll both a child with diabetes and an unaffected
child in T1DCTs. Therefore, we need to address any existing
misconceptions about placebo allocation when discussing trials
with parents.
A previous study revealed that despite overall support for
pediatric research, many parents are reluctant to involve their own
children [5]. Although risk-benefit considerations were an
important aspect of decision-making regarding trial participation
[5,7], Caldwell and workers found that many parents struggled
with the responsibility of consent by proxy because of concerns
about the unknown or unexpected future side effects [5]. Likewise,
we observed a disconnect between parents’ overall belief in the
importance of trial participation and actual willingness to enroll
children in studies. In our study, we find that parents’ decisions
regarding trial enrollment are fundamentally driven by a desire to
balance potential benefits for their children with risks of side effects
or potential harm from trial participation. Nevertheless, some
parents were uncomfortable with the responsibility surrounding
consent by proxy, which negatively impacted willingness to enroll
their children. Furthermore, our results showed that discomfort
with consent by proxy was a strong predictor for willingness to
enroll. With regard to parents’ assessment of risk-benefit, one may
also hypothesize that this evaluation may be skewed immediately
after diagnosis. We did not administer the survey to parents at the
time of diagnosis, but many respondent families were within the
first year of diagnosis. We found no correlation between
willingness to enroll and the time since diagnosis. Thus, if attitudes
and trial acceptance are altered immediately post-diagnosis, this
effect wanes rapidly. This possible renormalization of attitudes
could relate to the extensive social network of established T1D
families that supports newly diagnosed families.
Our results emphasize the importance of a healthcare provider’s
role in the recruitment process for T1DCTs. In previous studies,
parents acknowledged seeking their pediatrician’s advice regarding
trial participation because they trust their opinion and medical
knowledge [5,7]. Tercyak and coworkers also found that provider
behavior influences adolescent acceptance of randomized clinical
trials for T1D [8]. In our study, parents reported the majority of
information they received about T1DCTs came from their
pediatric diabetes physician. Similar to previous reports, we saw
that most parents believe that doctors have the best interest of
patients in mind when approaching them about trial enrollment.
This belief was an important predictor of both WTEDC and
WTEnDC, further highlighting the importance of the relationship
between pediatricians and their patients’ families in T1DCT
enrollment.
Several limitations of the present study must be acknowledged.
Our study population was relatively homogenous. Similar to the
study reported by Caldwell et al. [5], respondents were largely
white females. Likewise, we also determined that most pediatric
TrialNet enrollees at our institution are White, and their
consenting parents were most often mothers. Therefore, we seem
to have captured the attitudes of parents with similar demographic
characteristics as those who enroll their children in observational
studies, but are reluctant to enter interventional trials. It is possible
that mothers are the parents who most frequently bring their child
to our diabetes clinic, and are thus more likely to be the ones
available to fill out surveys and sign consent forms for trial
enrollement. Nevertheless, fathers may influence decisions regard￾ing a child’s trial enrollment in ways that differ from that of
mothers, making it important to ascertain their attitudes and to
involve them in the educational and consent processes. It may also
be the case that fathers and ethnic minorities are in fact just as
likely to accompany their children to clinic, but are not asked as
often to participate in studies. This is less likely given that the
survey was made available to all parents and guardians who
brought their children to our clinic. Another possibility is that
fathers and ethnic minorities are less likely to be willing to
participate. If fathers, minorities, or other non-responders differ in
their attitudes towards T1DCTs compared to those who
responded, there may be non-response bias effects. Our study
was not powered to detect these differences. Although we have
limited representation of responses from racial and ethnic
minorities, we find it reassuring that recruitment rates for African
Americans in our study (7%) are very similar to the prevalence of
African American children with type 1 diabetes in the United
States, according to the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth Study
(9.2%) [18]. It should also be noted that our study population is
reflective of the patient population served by our institution, which
may not be universally applicable.

By undertanding parents’ attitudes, we can improve T1DCT
recruitment, both in the sense of attaining higher enrollment rates
and of making trial participation a positive experience, thereby
encouraging adherence to trial protocol and participation in future
studies. Although baseline willingness to enroll is not high, opinion
about T1DCTs may be improved by increasing education efforts.
We have identified several key modifiable parental factors
concerning T1DCTs: difficulty understanding information about
T1DCTs, parental concerns regarding potential costs associated
with participation, discomfort with placebo treatment, and fears of
their child serving as ‘‘guinea pigs’’ for research. Additionally,
communicating more clearly and openly with parents may help
address any potential conflict with consent by proxy or emotional
responses to their child’s illness, which has the potential to
positively impact T1DCT participation.
Materials and Methods
Questionnaire Development
A questionnaire was designed to assess parental attitudes toward
T1DCTs and to identify factors correlating with perceived
willingness to enroll a child. Input from local diabetes experts
was used to identify key domains expected to reflect dimensions of
influence over parental attitudes. Domains identified included
family sociodemographic background, child-specific characteris￾tics, perceived risks associated with diabetes, clinical trial
knowledge and experience, perceived risks and benefits associated
with trial participation, perceived trial-related commitment,
comfort with specific trial protocols, trust in healthcare providers
and research, and motivations to enroll children in trials. The
questionnaire was refined through feedback from two semistruc￾tured parent focus groups, and was piloted in 15 parents at Camp
Sugar Falls (http://www.diabetes.org/living-with-diabetes/
parents-and-kids/ada-camps/camps/2011/camp-sugar-falls￾2011.html). The final questionnaire consisted of 48 items including
open-ended, yes/no, and five-point Likert response formats
(Figure S1). To assess parental willingness to enroll their children
with diabetes (WTEDC) and their unaffected children (WTEnDC)
in T1DCTs, parents were asked to rate their willingness to enroll
each using the following scale: 1) not at all, 2) a little, 3) some, 4) a
great deal, or 5) completely. Ratings of 4 and 5 were considered to
represent significant willingness, and 1 and 2 ratings were
considered to represent unwillingness to enroll. The protocol
was approved by the Vanderbilt Institutional Review Board.
Study Participants
Participants were parents of children with type 1 diabetes.
Questionnaires were distributed at the Vanderbilt Diabetes Family
Day (n = 21), a yearly gathering for pediatric diabetes patients and
their families, and during routine visits at the Vanderbilt Eskind
Pediatric Diabetes Clinic (VEDC) between 11/12/08–11/21/08
(n = 67) and 02/06–03/27 (n = 77). Response rate was based on
number of questionnaires distributed as compared to returned at
Diabetes Family Day, and the number of type 1 diabetes patients
seen at the VEDC during the defined period.
To assess whether the demographic distribution our study
sample adequately reflects that of our clinic population, we
determined the demographic breakdown of our entire patient
population. We also determined the ethnic demographics of the
most recent 102 TrialNet enrollees younger than 18 years of age,
and the proportion of consent forms signed by their mothers or
female guardians versus fathers or male guardians.
Data Analysis
Statistics were performed using R: A Language and Environ￾ment for Statistical Computing (R Foundation for Statistical
Computing, Vienna, Austria) and significance was defined as
p#0.05. Percentages, frequencies, and Spearman’s correlations
were calculated to examine relationships between ordinal variables
probing domains discussed above and WTEDC and WTEnDC.
To determine predictors for WTEDC and WTEnDC, we fitted
two adjusted ordinal (logistic) proportional odds models. Variable
selection for the analysis was based on clinical relevance and
potential for future intervention while refraining from overfitting
the models using a limited sample size calculation based on a 10:1
ratio of predictor to outcome events [19]. The following variables
were included in the analysis for each of the two models:
perception of information obtained about trials as being easy to
understand, comfort with child receiving placebo treatment as part
of T1DCTs, belief that providers have the interest of patients in
mind when asking to enroll, belief that it should be child’s decision
to enroll in trials when old enough to do so (discomfort with
consent by proxy), fear of child being treated as a ‘‘guinea pig,’’
lack of trust in research, and fear child may suffer side effects from
trial participation.
