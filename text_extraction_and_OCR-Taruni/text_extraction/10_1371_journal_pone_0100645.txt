Abstract
Background: Molecular microbiological analysis of airway samples in asthma has demonstrated an altered microbiome in
comparison to healthy controls. Such changes may have relevance to treatment-resistant severe asthma, particularly those
with neutrophilic airway inflammation, as bacteria might be anticipated to activate the innate immune response, a process
that is poorly steroid responsive. An understanding of the relationship between airway bacterial presence and dominance in
severe asthma may help direct alternative treatment approaches.
Objective: We aimed to use a culture independent analysis strategy to describe the presence, dominance and abundance of
bacterial taxa in induced sputum from treatment resistant severe asthmatics and correlate findings with clinical
characteristics and airway inflammatory markers.
Methods: Induced sputum was obtained from 28 stable treatment-resistant severe asthmatics. The samples were divided
for supernatant IL-8 measurement, cytospin preparation for differential cell count and Terminal Restriction Fragment Length
Polymorphism (T-RFLP) profiling for bacterial community analysis.
Results: In 17/28 patients, the dominant species within the airway bacterial community was Moraxella catarrhalis or a
member of the Haemophilus or Streptococcus genera. Colonisation with these species was associated with longer asthma
disease duration (mean (SD) 31.8 years (16.7) vs 15.6 years (8.0), p = 0.008), worse post-bronchodilator percent predicted
FEV1 (68.0% (24.0) vs 85.5% (19.7), p = 0.025) and higher sputum neutrophil differential cell counts (median (IQR) 80% (67–
83) vs 43% (29–67), p = 0.001). Total abundance of these organisms significantly and positively correlated with sputum IL-8
concentration and neutrophil count.
Conclusions: Airway colonisation with potentially pathogenic micro-organisms in asthma is associated with more severe
airways obstruction and neutrophilic airway inflammation. This altered colonisation may have a role in the development of
an asthma phenotype that responds less well to current asthma therapies.

Introduction
Although for many years the lower airways were assumed to be
sterile, the recent application of molecular microbiological analysis
has identified that this is not the case. It is now appreciated that
there is a diversity of bacteria present within healthy airways and
that this may be disarranged in asthma [1–4]. By sampling the
lower airways by various methods, including bronchoalveolar
lavage [3], protected brushings taken at bronchoscopy [1,4] and
sputum induction [2], the asthmatic airways have been reported to
have an altered bacterial microbiota composition, as compared to
that in the healthy airways, though there are inconsistencies in the
details of these findings. This altered bacterial community
composition has been linked to bronchial hyper reactivity in
asthma [1] and, more specifically, the presence of Haemophilus
influenzae has been associated with altered macrophage activation
pathways in asthmatics who have relative steroid resistance [3].
Whilst the treatment-resistant severe end of the asthmatic
spectrum only represents 5–10% of asthmatics, their disease is
associated with disproportionately large healthcare utilisation costs
on account of inadequate disease control and frequent disease

exacerbations [5,6].This group, which represents the major unmet
clinical need in asthma, is appreciated not to represent a single
airway disorder, with induced sputum analysis identifying disease
heterogeneity. Both eosinophilic dominant and neutrophilic
dominant disease phenotypes are described [7,8], with neutro￾philic disease linked to a sub-optimal response to inhaled
corticosteroids [9,10]. Whilst eosinophilic disease has been
associated with T Helper 2 (Th2) high disease processes,
neutrophilic inflammation may be related to non-Th2 inflamma￾tion, such as that associated with activation of the innate immune
response [11,12], as bacteria and bacterial products are recognised
to be potent innate immune stimulants. Endotoxins, soluble
fragments of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from the outer membrane
of Gram negative bacteria, and Gram positive cell wall compo￾nents such as lipoteichoic acid (LTA), can act as pathogen
associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) which are recognised by
Toll-like receptors, CD14 and collectins. Activation of Toll-like
receptors leads to an inflammatory cascade resulting in production
of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-8, IL-1 and tumour necrosis
factor alpha (TNF-a), generating a shift toward a Th1 and Th17
response, neutrophil recruitment and a change in inflammatory
cell differential profile [13]. Consistent with this, there is evidence
in treatment–resistant severe asthma of increased TNF- a gene
and protein expression within the airways compared to that in
mild asthma [14]. There has thus been speculation that abnormal
airway bacterial colonisation may drive the switch to a neutro￾philic phenotype [1]. However, currently there has been no
examination of the airway microbiome in a population of severe
treatment resistant neutrophilic asthma, or an examination of any
differences existing between the microbiota present in patients
with severe asthma with different inflammatory phenotypes.
We hypothesised that there would be no difference between the
microbiota present in patients with treatment-resistant severe
asthma with different underlying inflammatory phenotypes and
that airway microbiota would not correlate with clinical measures
of disease severity. We therefore used culture-independent
Terminal Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (T-RFLP)
analysis [15–17] to profile the bacterial composition of induced
sputum samples from treatment-resistant severe asthmatics during
a non-exacerbation phase of their disease. We identified numer￾ically dominant bacterial taxa in these infections and assessed their
relationship with clinical measures of inflammation and disease.
We demonstrate that airway colonisation with Haemophilus spp.,
Streptococcus spp. or M. catarrhalis positively correlate with sputum
neutrophilia and lower FEV1, with M. catarrhalis the bacterial
species most associated with neutrophilic disease.
Materials and Methods
Ethics statement
The study was approved by the Southampton and South West
Hampshire Ethics Committee and all subjects provided written,
informed consent. Subjects were recruited from the Wessex Severe
Asthma Cohort.
Study design
Asthmatic subjects who had chronic persistent severe disease, as
defined by the American Thoracic Society workshop on refractory
asthma [18], were selected for study. All participants had disease
which fulfilled the following criteria: maintenance treatment with
high dose inhaled steroids plus at least 2 add on maintenance
therapies, including long acting beta-agonists, leukotriene receptor
antagonists and oral steroids at GINA/British Thoracic Society
asthma management steps 4 or 5 [19], persistent symptoms (6 part
asthma control questionnaire score(ACQ6) of . 1.5) that required
the need for short acting beta-agonist rescue medication for
symptom relief and a history of at least one disease exacerbation
within the last year that required a course of oral steroids or an
increase in dose of maintenance oral steroids to improve disease
control. Alternative causes for symptoms other than asthma had
been excluded. No selection restrictions were applied with respect
to gender or race. Current smokers, or those who had stopped less
than a year previously were excluded. All had been free from an
exacerbation for a minimum of six weeks and none were receiving
treatment with antibiotics. No patients had clinical or routine
immunological evidence of an underlying immune disorder or
evidence of clinically relevant bronchiectasis on chest radiographs
or lung computed tomography scanning. Detailed clinico-physi￾ological characterisation was undertaken (Table 1).
Sample collection and processing
Sputum was induced using hypertonic saline and collected in
accordance with the European Respiratory Society guidelines. If
participants failed to produce sputum, they were excluded from
the study, all sputum samples collected were analysed and the data
presented [20]. Sputum plugs were selected from expectorates and
divided for differential cell counting with the remainder stored at
280uC for subsequent molecular analyses. Sputa for differential
cell counts were immediately processed with dithioerythritol, to
separate cells from the fluid phase, homogenised, filtered using a
100 mm cell strainer (BD Falcon) to remove mucus, centrifuged at
10 G, the supernatant removed and the cell pellet resuspended in
phosphate buffered saline. A total cell count was made using a
haemocytometer and cell viability determined using trypan blue
exclusion.
Cytospins were prepared using 76104 cells and centrifuged at
450 rpm for 6 minutes (Shandon Cytospin 2). Cytospins were
fixed with and stained using Rapi-Diff I, II and III (DiaCheM Int.
Ltd, UK) and differential cell counts were obtained from 400 non￾squamous cells.
Sputum Supernatant and IL-8 Measurement
Interleukin-8 measurements were undertaken on the sputum
supernatant using the CXCL8/IL8 DuoSet ELISA kit (R&D
Systems, UK) as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
Terminal Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (T￾RFLP) Profiling
Sputum samples were processed for T-RFLP analysis as
described previously [16]. Briefly, nucleic acid was extracted
directly from induced sputum samples and a 927 base fragment of
the 16S rRNA genes amplified with a 59 IRD700-tagged primer.
Subsequently, the amplified 16S rRNA genes were digested with
CfoI and resolved on a IR2 automated DNA sequencer (LI-COR
Biosciences). T-RFLP profiles were analysed using Phoretix one￾dimensional Advanced software, v.5.10 (Nonlinear Dynamics,
Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK). T-RF band sizes were determined by
comparison with MicroSTEP-15a (700 nm) size marker (Micro￾zone, Lewes, UK). T-RF band volume was determined and
expressed as a percentage of the total volume of bands detected in
each electrophoretic profile. These percentages are reported here
as ‘‘relative abundance’’ T-RF bands from each sample profile
were rank ordered, with bacterial species from which the highest
percentage relative abundance band was derived classified as
‘‘dominant’’ within the airway microbiota.

Asthma Sub-typing
Subjects were defined as having neutrophilic asthma if the
sputum neutrophil differential cell count was greater than 61% of
non-squamous cells.
Statistics
Data were analysed using SPSS Statistics (IBM, New York,
USA). Non-normally distributed data were compared using the
Mann-Whitney U-test. Correlations between nonparametric data
were undertaken using Spearman’s rank correlation. Two-tailed
tests were used and the level of significance was taken as p = 0.05.
Results
Induced sputum was collected from 28 severe asthmatics for T￾RFLP analysis (Table 1). These comprised 7 men and 21 women
with a mean age of 47.7 yrs (range 19–75) and a mean (6SD)
disease duration of 25.4 (615.9) years. Fourteen subjects were life￾long non-smokers and 14 ex-smokers. Their mean post-broncho￾dilator FEV1 (6SD) was 74.8623.6 percent predicted and they
were all receiving high dose inhaled steroids with a mean daily
dose equivalent to 2189 mg of inhaled beclometasone. In addition,
13 subjects were receiving long-term maintenance therapy with
oral steroids. Eighteen subjects were atopic, 18 had disease of late
onset, as defined by onset after the age of 12 years, and all had
inadequate disease control (ACQ6.1.5) with a mean ACQ6 score
of 2.96 (61.1). In 2 of these 28 volunteers the sputum sample size
was insufficient to obtain a reliable differential cell count. The
appropriateness of the sputum samples obtained in the others was
indicated by a mean total differential cell squamous cell counts of
8.1% (611.5). Seventeen of these treatment-resistant severe
asthmatics had neutrophilic asthma.
16S rRNA gene T-RFLP analysis was used to profile the total
airway bacterial community in each sample. Whilst diverse,
samples analysed here were typically dominated by one bacterial
species that represented a majority of total bacterial abundance.
We therefore assessed the relationship between the identity of this
predominant species and clinical measures of disease, a technique
that has been used successfully to identify relationships between
infective microbes and disease course in non-cystic fibrosis
bronchiectasis [21].
The potentially pathogenic micro-organisms (PPMs), Haemoph￾ilus sp., Streptococcus sp., or M. catarrhalis were identified as the
numerically dominant species in the majority (17/28) of patients
(Table 2). Other dominant taxa (number of subjects) were,
Veillonella sp. (5), Neisseria sp. (2), Prevotella sp. (2), Pseudomonas
aeruginosa (1) and an unassigned species (1). The presence of these
defined PPMs - Haemophilus sp., Streptococcus sp., or M. catarrhalis - as
a dominant species was found to be significantly associated with
neutrophilic asthma (p = 0.008, Table 1). Dominant airway
colonisation with any of these three bacteria taxa was associated
with a higher neutrophil differential cell count (Median (IQR)
80% (67–83) vs 43% (29–67), p = 0.001, Table 1) and the relative
abundance of Haemophilus sp., Streptococcus sp., and M. catarrhalis

neutrophil differential cell count (p = 0.037, Figure 1).
In subjects where Haemophilus sp., Streptococcus sp., or M. catarrhalis
predominated within airway microbiota, post-bronchodilator
percent predicted FEV1 was significantly lower than in subjects
where any other bacterial species was dominant (Mean (SD)
68.0% (24.0) vs 85.5% (19.7), p = 0.025, Table 1). Dominance of
these species was also associated with longer disease duration (31.8

positively correlated with disease duration (p = 0.037, Figure 2).
Individually, M. catarrhalis was the bacterial species most associated
with sputum neutrophilia, with a mean sputum neutrophil count

compared to 57.6% (620.1) in subjects where it was not.

Sputum IL-8 concentration was determined in the 26 samples
where sufficient material was available. Sputum IL-8 concentra￾tion was higher where Haemophilus sp., Streptococcus sp., or M.
catarrhalis was dominant compared to subjects where another taxon
was dominant, although this did not reach standard statistical
significance (p = 0.08, Table 1). Sputum IL-8 concentration did,
however, correlate significantly with the total abundance of
Haemophilus sp., Streptococcus sp., and M. catarrhalis (r = 0.43,
p = 0.027, Figure 1). The strongest species correlation with sputum
IL-8 concentrations was with M. catarrhalis (r = 0.48, p = 0.014).
Sputum IL-8 also correlated with neutrophil count (r = 0.68,
p = 0.001, Figure 2) and lower FEV1 post bronchodilator (r =
0.43, p = 0.03, Figure 2). Raw data tables are available in
supporting information file Data S1.
Discussion
We demonstrate that potentially pathogenic bacteria are present
within the airways in severe asthma and that the predominance of
M. catarrhalis or members of the Haemophilus or Streptococcus genera is
associated with a neutrophilic airway phenotype in treatment￾resistant persistent asthma. These microorganisms have been
associated with an increased risk of wheeze and early life asthma,
when present in neonates [22], and with worse and progressive
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in cigarette
smokers [23]. Our findings in severe asthma, demonstrating the
relevance of altered airway colonisation with pathogenic bacteria,
are thus concordant with previous data in other airway diseases.
In stable, smoking-related COPD, the presence of these
bacterial taxa within the lower airway is associated with an
increase in absolute neutrophil counts [23] as well as higher
concentrations of the neutrophil chemoattractant IL-8 [24], TNF￾a [25], and endotoxin [23]. PPM detection in COPD is also
associated with worse clinical outcomes including health status
[25], exacerbation rates [26] and rate of FEV1 decline [24]. In our
study examining asthma, the identification of these species within
sputum samples was associated with significantly lower lung
function. In addition these species were associated with a non￾significant increase in exacerbation rate in the preceding 12
months. There is thus consistency with the findings from COPD,
suggesting that the findings in treatment-resistant severe asthma
could have relevance to an adverse clinical outcome and provide
an explanation for the inadequate response to standard asthma
therapy in this severe asthma group. In our study in asthma, none
of the subjects were current smokers although fourteen were ex￾smokers. There was, however, no difference between the life-long
non-smokers and the ex-smokers in their profile of bacterial
dominance or their sputum neutrophil counts to indicate the
relevance of cigarette smoking history to these findings in severe
asthma, it is possible, however that this lack of difference could be
explained by the small sample size examined here.
Non-eosinophilic, neutrophilic asthma represents up to 25% of
symptomatic asthma patients and 59% of patients on high dose
inhaled corticosteroids attending asthma clinics [10,12]. Whilst
asthma is considered predominantly a T Helper 2 (Th2)
lymphocyte driven disease, with Th2 cytokines driving eosinophilic
inflammation, innate immune mechanisms may lead to a shift
towards Th1 or Th17 mediated neutrophilic inflammation in a
significant group of patients with severe asthma. Increased airway
bacterial load and specific bacterial species will lead to increased
soluble bacterial cell wall fragments such as LPS from the outer
cell membrane of Gram negative bacteria within the airway. The
lipid portion of the molecule, unlike the polysaccharide, is not
antigenically specific and is able to bind to pattern recognition
receptors to trigger the innate response and neutrophil recruit￾ment. Previous studies in COPD have shown that Haemophilus sp.,
Streptococcus sp., and M. catarrhalis are associated with increased
markers of innate immune activation and there is biological
plausibility that these species may have a role in neutrophilic
asthma. Consistent with this is a previous study in chronic
persistent severe asthma (n = 9) which demonstrated increased
mRNA expression of the innate immune receptors TLR2, TLR4
and CD14, as well as the cytokines IL-8 and IL-1b in induced
sputum from patients with neutrophilic asthma [11]. In this study,
neutrophilic airways inflammation was associated with higher
airway LPS and potentially pathogenic bacteria were cultured in
43% of patients. Although previous culture independent microbi￾ology studies on the asthmatic airway have not reported any
differences in microbiota composition between inflammatory
phenotypes, these studies were not designed to examine severe
treatment-resistant disease [1,4]. Although there was no statisti￾cally significant difference in the doses of oral or inhaled
corticosteroids between the groups in our study based on
microbiota composition, there was a trend towards a difference.

This may reflect a worse disease phenotype caused by potentially
pathogenic bacteria, or the higher steroid doses could have
induced a selection pressure within the airway. Currently it is
unclear which, if either, of these mechanisms is most important;
prospective studies may provide an answer in due course.
Induced sputum is a well-recognised technique for examining
lower airway inflammation. Further, the suitability of induced
sputum as a basis for analysis of airway microbiota has been
demonstrated previously [27,28]. Although expectorated sputum
passes the oropharynx, which raises the potential for upper airway
contamination, it has been established that if there is low salivary
contamination of the sputum sample, as reflected by fewer than
25% squamous cells, that sputum is a reliable sample for analysis
as cultured bacterial species resemble those from a transtracheal
aspirate [29] and that contamination of sputum with bacteria
originating in the oral cavity is relatively low [30]. Similarly in
COPD it has been demonstrated using culture independent
techniques that sputum and bronchial aspirate samples are similar
to each other [31]. As the sputum samples analysed in our study
had a mean squamous cell count of 8.1%, these previous findings
would be supportive of their use in evaluating lower airway
bacterial colonisation.
If the airway microbiome is relevant in neutrophilic asthma, it
would be expected that antibiotic therapy might be of benefit.
Whilst studies of chronic stable asthma, undifferentiated by
inflammatory phenotype, have been disappointing [32], two
studies selecting or analysing by inflammatory phenotype have
shown encouraging results. In one, clarithromycin given orally for
8 weeks was reported to improve asthma quality of life scores and
reduce airway IL-8 in patients with non-eosinophilic airway
inflammation when compared to those with eosinophilic disease
[33]. In the other, adding azithromycin to standard therapy in
exacerbation prone asthma was only effective in reducing the rate
of severe exacerbations and lower respiratory tract infection in
patients with non-eosinophilic disease [34]. These studies provide
clinical support to our data suggesting that the airway microbiota
in non-eosinophilic (neutrophilic) asthma is different to eosino￾philic phenotypes, and may be manipulated to improve clinical
outcomes.
In using the identity of the numerically dominant bacterial
taxon as a basis for assessing relationships between airways
microbiology and disease, our aim was to focus on infective
populations most likely to give rise to altered inflammatory
responses; a strategy that has been applied successfully in other
respiratory contexts [21]. Assessing whether the composition of the
airway microbiota excluding the dominant species is distinct in
severe asthma was not performed here, but represents a further
area where important insight might be gained. A further
important area for investigation is the extent to which the
relationships between PPM predominance and disease severity
reported here might be causal, a question that might be addressed
through prospective longitudinal analysis within individual sub￾jects.
The present study provides evidence to implicate the presence
of airway pathogenic bacteria, in particular Haemophilus sp.,
Streptococcus sp. or Moraxella catarrhalis in neutrophilic treatment￾resistant severe asthma. Sputum IL-8 concentrations correlated
with the total abundance of PPMs, particularly Moraxella catarrhalis,
linking disease pathophysiology with this abnormal airway
colonisation. As asthma is a heterogenous disease, with neutro￾philic asthma being recognised to represent a more steroid
resistant phenotype, a greater understanding of the molecular
mechanisms involved in the development of this phenotype may
enable the development of improved targeted therapies that
reduce the airway colonisation and the abnormal airway
inflammatory response associated with this altered pathogenic
bacterial load.
