Abstract Introduction We aimed to assess health-related quality of life (HrQoL) in biliary
atresia (BA) patients, based on original data and a literature review, and to determine
factors associated with their HrQoL.
Materials and Methods We reviewed available studies describing HrQoL in BA
patients. We assessed HrQoL in Dutch BA patients (6–16 years) using the validated
Child Health Questionnaire. We compared HrQoL scores in BA patients with healthy
peers and with children who had undergone major surgery in infancy or children with
chronic conditions. We determined the relationship between specific patient-related
factors and HrQoL.
Results Literature data indicated that HrQoL in children with BA is lower than in
healthy peers. In Dutch BA patients (n ¼ 38; age 10  3 years), parent-proxy physical
HrQoL (48  11) was significantly lower compared with two reference groups of
healthy peers (59  4 and 56  6, respectively, each p < 0.001), and lower than in
children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (60  5), asthma (54  6),
attending a cardiology clinic (52  n/r), congenital diaphragmatic hernia (53  7) or
D-transposition of the great arteries (54  6; all p < 0.05). Psychosocial HrQoL (50  9)
was lower than in healthy peers (54  6, p ¼ 0.02, and 53  6, p ¼ 0.07) and children
with asthma (54  6, p ¼ 0.02), and largely comparable to children with other chronic
conditions. Parent-proxy physical HrQoL was adversely related to adverse medical
event in the past year, special education, and motor impairments; psychosocial HrQoL
was adversely related to behavioral problems.
Conclusion Children with BA are at risk of impaired HrQoL. Special attention is
warranted for children with adverse medical events and special education.

Introduction
The increased survival in children with biliary atresia (BA) has
allowed a shift in research focus from survival to a more
holistic approach, including long-term functional outcomes
and quality of life (QoL). Health-related quality of life (HrQoL)
reflects the perceived impact of a disease and its treatment on
well-being and functioning of the patient.1 Several studies
have shown a significantly impaired HrQoL in children with a
chronic condition2 or after major surgery for complex disease
in infancy, such as, congenital heart disease, necrotizing
enterocolitis, omphalocele, and esophageal atresia.3 Recently,
Parmar et al described impaired HrQoL in a systematic review
on pediatricliver transplantation (LTx) recipients, inwhich the
proportion of BA etiology per study ranged between 20 and
98%.4 These studies did not describe HrQoL in patients trans￾planted for BA specifically, although congenital disease was
associated with lower HrQoL in transplant recipients.4,5
Knowledge on factors associated with HrQoL in BA
patients is scarce. Devine et al described that the HrQoL in
LTx recipients is influenced more by behavioral indicators of
adherence and family conflict, than by medical or surgical
events.6 In children who underwent surgery for congenital
heart disease, neurodevelopmental deficits are associated
with worse psychosocial health status in adolescence.7 Re￾cently, we described significantly impaired neurodevelop￾mental outcomes in Dutch school-aged children with BA.8 As
impaired neurodevelopment might influence daily function￾ing we hypothesized that neurodevelopmental impairments
in children with BA might affect their HrQoL.
In this study, we first aimed to provide an overview of
recent literature on HrQoL in children with BA, both with
native liver and those who had undergone an LTx. Second, we
aimed to assess HrQoL in Dutch school-aged children with
BA, to determine differences in HrQoL as perceived by BA
patients and their parents, and to compare HrQoL of children
with BA with their healthy peers and with children who had
undergone other major surgery in infancy or with a chronic
condition. Third, we explored factors associated with HrQoL
in children with BA.
Materials and Methods
Literature Search
To provide an overview of literature on HrQoL in BA patients
we used the following predefined search terms in PubMed:
(“biliary atresia”[Mesh] OR biliary atresia [tiab]) AND (“Qual￾ity of life”[Mesh] OR Health-related quality of life [tiab]). We
searched the reference lists of the included studies for
additional studies that were eligible for inclusion. Inclusion
criteria were studies that reported on HrQoL in patients with
BA specifically, either with native liver or after having
undergone LTx, published between January 1, 2010 and
November 31, 2019. Exclusion criteria were unavailability
of full text articles, duplicates, manuscripts that were not
available in English language, review articles or case
reports/series, or studies that assessed HrQoL in LTx recip￾ients in general but that do not stratify on BA etiology.
As we hypothesized that neurodevelopmental outcomes
affect HrQoL in BA patients, we added search terms related to
neurodevelopment, i.e., cognition, motor skills and behavior.
However, this new search did not reveal studies on the
relation between neurodevelopmental outcomes and HrQoL
in BA patients.
We searched for studies on HrQoL in children who under￾went major surgery in infancy or with a chronic condition, that
used the Child Health Questionnaire, (CHQ), using the follow￾ing predefined search terms in PubMed: (“Child”[Mesh] OR
“Infant, Newborn”[Mesh] OR child
[tiab] OR youth[tiab]
OR infant
[tiab] OR newborn
[tiab]) AND (“surgery”[tiab] OR
chronic condition [tiab] OR chronic disease[tiab]) AND (“Quality
of life”[Mesh] OR Health-related quality of life[tiab]) AND (child
health questionnaire [tiab] OR CHQ [tiab]). Inclusion criteria for
reference groups were studies that reported the CHQ parent￾proxy physical or psychosocial HrQoL summary scores of
children with a mean age between 7 and 13 (within 1 standard
deviation [SD] of the mean age in the BA group).
Studies were independently and blindly screened by two
authors, L.H.R. and E.M.W.S. Observer agreement was calculated
and interpreted by means of Cohen’s Kappa.9 In case of dis￾crepancies a third author (J.L.M.B.) was consulted. Data extrac￾tion was performed by L.H.R. and crosschecked by E.M.W.S.
Data Collection in Dutch Children with BA
Children between 6 and 16 years eligible for inclusion were
identified using the Netherlands Study Group on Biliary
Atresia Registry (NeSBAR), a prospective database that con￾tains information of all children with BA in the
Netherlands.10 Exclusion criteria were presence of chronic
disease unrelated to BA and insufficient knowledge of the
Dutch language. Ethical approval was obtained from the
UMCG Medical Ethics Committee and the study was per￾formed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
Invitation letters were sent to all eligible children and their
parents, followed by a phone call to further explain the goal of
this study. After obtaining informed consent from either
parents or caregivers, and from children aged 12 years or
older, participants were asked to fill out the questionnaires.
Information on the health status of the children was obtained
from the electronic patient registry systems or the NeSBAR
database. These data included gender, age at LTx, and whether
the child had an adverse medical event related to BA in the past
year. Adverse medical events, directly or indirectly related to
liver disease or LTx included, but were not limited to, chol￾angitis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, portal hypertension,
hepatopulmonary syndrome, posttransplant lymphoprolifer￾ative disorder, portal vein thrombosis, stenosis of the biliary
anastomosis, and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
Measurements
A short questionnaire on demographic status was used. Ques￾tionsincluded educationallevel of the child, householdincome,
marital status, and highest educational level or work status of
parents or caregivers. Educational levels were classified in
accordance with the International Standard Classification of
Education Fields of Training and Education.11

To assess HrQoL in children with BA, we used the interna￾tionally validated CHQ.12,13 This questionnaire has been
developed to test both physical and psychosocial HrQoL of
children aged 5 years and older.14 The CHQ consists of a 50-
item parent-proxy form (CHQ-PF50), and an 87-item child￾reported form (CHQ-CF87) for children aged 10 years or
older.15,16 The CHQ assesses HrQoL on 15 different domains.
Higher domain scores indicate a better HrQoL. Reliability and
validity of the Dutch version of the CHQ are good.15–18
We used proportions of our previously published data
from partly the same patient cohort on IQ (Wechsler Intelli￾gence Scale for Children-III-NL), motor skills (Movement￾ABC), and behavior (Child Behavioral Checklist) to explore
the association of possible neurodevelopmental impair￾ments with HrQoL in children with BA.8
Reference Data
To compare HrQoL domain scores of children with BA with a
norm population of Dutch schoolchildren (aged 5–13) we
used reference data as reported by Raat et al.17,19 We also
compared the parent-proxy physical and psychosocial sum￾mary scores to more recently collected reference data on
Dutch schoolchildren (aged 4–11) without a chronic condi￾tion as described by Bai et al.2 These data were collected
using the shortened version of the CHQ parent-report form
(CHQ-PF28), of which the summary score is an acceptable
alternative for the longer version of the questionnaire (CHQ￾PF50).20 We compared the parent-proxy CHQ summary
scores of children with BA with children with major surgery
in infancy or chronic conditions as follows: attention-deficit
hyperactivity disorder,2 asthma,2 children attending a car￾diology clinic,21 chronic recurrent rhinosinusitis,22 congeni￾tal diaphragmatic hernia,23 D-transposition of the great
arteries,7,24 esophageal atresia,25 history of cancer,26 symp￾tomatic epilepsy,27 and tetralogy of Fallot.28 These reference
data were retrieved from studies that were identified by the
previously reported literature search. We included all studies
that used the CHQ to assess HrQoL in any chronic disease or
major surgery in infancy.
Data Analysis
Distribution of data is reported as number (%), mean  SD, or
median [range]. In case of >20% missing data on the CHQ
questionnaire the patient was excluded for analyses. In case of
nonunique answers, where a participant circled two answers
for one question, the least extreme answer was registered. Per
questionnaire, domain scores and summary or final scores
were calculated in accordance with the questionnaire man￾uals.29 We reported the percentage of children with the
maximum score to provide additional information about the
distribution of scores. We defined children with a summary
score of more than 1 SD below the population mean as “poor
HrQoL,” in accordance with previous publications from the
Childhood Liver Disease Research Network.30,31
Parametric and nonparametric analyses were applied as
appropriate. One-sample t-tests for normally distributed
data and one-sample Wilcoxon signed rank tests for non￾normally distributed data were used to compare children
with BA to the reference population. Intraclass correlation
coefficients (ICC) between parent- and child-reported do￾main scores were calculated using one-way random effects
models, based on absolute agreement. ICCs were designated
as poor (0.50), moderate (0.50–0.75), good (0.75–0.90), and
excellent agreement (0.90).32
Effect sizes were calculated for differences between the
study and reference population bymeans of a Cohen’s d ([Mean
of reference data  Mean of BA group]/SDpooled), where
SDpooled is the pooled estimate of the SD in the reference
population and study population. When there were substan￾tial differences between the study sample size and that of the
reference population, Hedges’ g effect sizewas calculated (with
pooling of weighted SD). Effect sizes are interpreted as small
(0.20), moderate (0.50), or large (0.80).33,34
Either independent t-test for normally distributed data or
Mann-Whitney U test for non-normally distributed data was
used to compare outcomes between subgroups, e.g., children
with nativeliver versus LTx. Chi-square or Fisher Exact analysis
were used to compare proportions. Univariable linear regres￾sion analysis was performed to determine factors that were
associated with HrQoL. Any factor associated with HrQoL with
a p-value <0.2 was included in a multivariable generalized
linear regression model. Backward selection method was
applied to select the most significant variables throughout
consecutive regression models. The regression models were
checked for regression assumptions, as well as for multicolli￾nearity and interaction terms. The effect of outliers on regres￾sion performance was checked using sensitivity analysis (by
comparing model performance before and after exclusion of
outliers). Data were captured in Redcap35 and analyzed using
IBM SPSS version 23. Throughout analyses, p-value <0.05 was
considered statistically significant.
Results
Literature Search on HrQoL in Children with BA
We included nine studies on HrQoL in BA patients (n ¼ 984
children, n ¼ 102 adults). Four studies assessed patients who
survived with their native liver,36–39 two studies assessed LTx
recipients with BA specifically,40,41 and three studies assessed
both30,42,43 (►Table 1). There was a moderate agreement
(Kappa 0.77) between the two screening authors L.H.R. and
E.M.W.S. as one author included three more studies than the
other. After discussion with the third author (J.L.M.B.), those
three articles were also included.We were unable to obtain the
full article of one abstract and, therefore, excluded that study.44
All studies on self-reported HrQoL in children with BA
described lower HrQoL compared with healthy peers.30,39,41
Parent-proxy based studies reported somewhat controver￾sial results, with one study describing similar HrQoL as
healthy peers37; however, the majority of parents also
reported impaired HrQoL in children.30,39,41 Four studies
included adult BA patients,36,38,42,43 who scored their
HrQoL as similar to healthy peers, except for general health
perception or physical QoL in studies on patients who still
had their native liver.38,42 Five studies investigated the
difference between children with native liver and LTx

recipients and all described similar HrQoL in both
groups30,37,39,42,43 (►Table 1).
HrQoL in Dutch Children with BA
For the analysis of HrQoL in Dutch children, 38 children with BA
were included (►Fig. 1). The CHQ parent-proxy form was filled
out for 35 children and 21 children filled out the child-report
form. Data of nine children (14%) were excluded from analysis
due to excessive missing data (accepted participation but no
completion of questionnaires, or >20% of missing answers).
In- and excluded patients did not significantly differ with regard
to gender (respectively 56% vs. 53% boys, p ¼ 0.80) or history of
LTx (respectively 76% vs. 88%, p ¼ 0.17). ►Table 2 shows the
characteristics of the 38 included children and their parents.
The parent-proxy physical HrQoL summary score in chil￾dren with BA (48  11), was significantly (p ¼ 0.001) lower
compared with reference data from healthy peers (56  6,
effect size g 1.21),19 as 43% of the BA children scored 1 SD or
more below the population mean, which we defined as poor
HrQoL. The parent-proxy psychosocial summary score of
50  9 in children with BA seemed (p ¼ 0.06) to be lower
than in healthy peers (53  6, effect size g 0.76),19 as 31% of
children scored 1 SD or more below the population mean.
Compared with more recently collected reference data of
Dutch schoolchildren without a chronic condition, children
with BA scored significantly lower on both physical (48  11
vs. 59  4, p < 0.001, effect size g 2.69) and psychosocial
HrQoL (50  9 vs. 54  6, p ¼ 0.02, effect size g 0.99).2 Sensi￾tivity analysis (i.e., exclusion of outlier) revealed comparable
results (data not shown).
Results on parent-proxy and child self-reported HrQoL are
presented in ►Table 3. All children aged 10 year or older
were asked to self-report their HrQoL. Overall parent–child
agreement was moderate to excellent for health perception,
physical functioning, emotional role functioning, self-es￾teem, and family activities. There was poor to moderate
agreement on behavior, behavioral/physical role function￾ing, bodily pain, mental health, and family cohesion.
Compared with reference data of healthy Dutch children,
almost all parent-proxy HrQoL domains were lower in BA.19
Two parents (5%) rated the global health of their child as poor,
and six parents (16%) as fair. The majority of parents (n ¼ 25,
66%) rated the health of their child to be similar to 1 year ago,
nine parents (23%) as improved, and four parents (11%) as
somewhat worse. None of the parents rated their child’s
current health to be much worse than 1 year earlier. Children
themselves reported significantly lower scores on physical
functioning and emotional role functioning than their healthy
peers (►Table 3). None of the children rated their global health
as poor and only three children (15%) as fair.
The comparison of parent-proxy physical and psychoso￾cial HrQoL summary scores in Dutch BA patients and children
with other major surgery in infancy or chronic condition is
reported in ►Table 4.

Factors Associated with HrQoL in Children
with BA
The most frequently reported factors in literature, that are
adversely associatedwith self-reported or parent-proxy HrQoL
in children with BA, include adverse medical events,30,40,42
higher number of types of prescribed drugs,40,41 and younger
age of child30,40 (►Table 1).
In multivariable regression analysis, parent-proxy physi￾cal HrQoL in Dutch children with BA was on average (β) 10.95
points (95% confidence interval [CI] 16.91, 4.99, p ¼ 0.001)
lower in children who had an adverse medical event in the
past year, 9.34 points (95% CI 16.90, 1.79, p ¼ 0.02) lower
in children who received special education, 0.55 points (95%
CI 0.93, 0.17, p ¼ 0.007) lower per point increase on motor
impairments, and 11.54 points (95% CI 6.13, 16.94, p < 0.001)
higher in children of whom at least one parent completed a
high household educational level, while adjusted for gender
(►Table 5). One child, who had an adverse medical event in
the past year, had a score of 10 on the physical HrQoL
summary scale and was considered an outlier. Sensitivity
analysis, by excluding this outlier, showed a change in the
magnitudes of the factors “adverse medical event in the past
year” (β 4.93 [10.56, 0.70], p ¼ 0.08) and “time passed
since LTx” (β 0.78 [0.01, 1.55], p ¼ 0.05).
After multivariable regression analysis, parent-proxy psy￾chosocial HrQoL significantly (p ¼ 0.002) decreased with
0.17 points (95% CI 0.28, 0.07) per every point increase
on child behavioral problems, while adjusted for gender
(►Table 5).
There were no statistically significant differences in
HrQoL between children with native liver and children
who had undergone a LTx.
Discussion
In this study we determined HrQoL in BA patients, based on
results from recent literature and from a cohort of Dutch
children with BA. Literature from the past decade shows
significantly lower HrQoL in children with BA compared with
their healthy peers. All studies on self-reported HrQoL and
the majority of studies on parent-proxy HrQoL reported
impaired HrQoL compared with healthy peers. Our findings

In our cohort of Dutch children with BA, parents reported
stronger family cohesion than parents of healthy peers. Previ￾ously, Lind et al found that adults with BA report higher scores
on the social domain.38 Thesefindings might be explained by a
higher involvement of family members or friends, or by
adapted expectations due to a patient’s chronic disease.38
Another aim of this study was to determine patient￾related factors that are associated with HrQoL in BA patients.

In our cohort, we did not find significant differences in HrQoL
between children who survived with their native liver and
children post-LTx. Our findings correspond with previous
studies, which also did not find significant differences be￾tween children with native liver or post-LTx.30,37,42,43 One
study found similar HrQoL in adult LTx recipients with BA
compared with healthy peers, but lower HrQoL in patients
who still had their native liver, although the differences
between the two patient groups did not reach statistical
significance.42 One has to bear in mind the small proportion
of children who survive with their native liver, which might
have masked any statistically significant differences between
the two patient groups. Both patient groups are at risk of
adverse medical events. However, native liver survivors
might be more frequently hospitalized due to ongoing liver
cirrhosis and portal hypertension, compared with LTx recip￾ients, which may influence their HrQoL.
The most frequent reported factors in literature that are
adversely associated with HrQoL include higher number of
prescribed drugs,40,41 adverse medical events,30,40,42 and
younger age of child.30,40 Although adult patients with BA
still report an impaired general health,38 several studies
showed that young adult BA patients, either with native liver
or after LTx, did not experience an impaired HrQoL compared
with their healthy peers.36,38,43 The findings of our literature
analysis support the concept that the negative effect of a
disease on HrQoL reduces as patients age. This phenomenon
might be explained by the “response shift,” a change in an
individuals’ perception of their QoL, based on their individual
experiences, which might have changed their internal stand￾ards or values.45 In a group of young LTx recipients (<5 years
of age), Cole et al showed that their physical abilities and
HrQoL improved in the first year after LTx.46 In our Dutch
cohort of BA patients, we did not find a significant association
between age and HrQoL. Another explanation could be that
the number of LTx-related complications decreases after a
certain period of time, which might cause an improvement in
HrQoL since data from our cohort showed a significant
association between adverse medical events in the past
year and physical HrQoL. Nevertheless, longitudinal studies
describing HrQoL trajectories in children with BA, with native
liver or transplantation, are scarce.4 Another possible expla￾nation for the differences in HrQoL as perceived by children
and adults with BA might be the different questionnaires that

associated with impaired HrQoL.8 In our present study, we
report strong support for this hypothesis and show that
children with BA who receive special education and children
who have impaired motor skills score lower on parent-proxy
physical HrQoL. In the Netherlands, special education is pro￾vided for those children who cannot participate in regular
education. The majority of children at special education suffer
from cognitive deficits, psychiatric or serious behavioral prob￾lems (e.g., autism) or have physical disabilities, or a chronic
illness that hinders regular education.47 We showed that
behavioral problems in children with BA are associated with
lower parent-proxy psychosocial HrQoL. This might be
explained by more limitations in schoolwork and activities
with friends due to behavioral difficulties. Our data implicate
that children with neurodevelopmental impairments are in￾deed at increased risk of impaired HrQoL. Furthermore, both
children and their parents reported limitations due to emo￾tional difficulties which might be caused by symptoms of
anxiety and depression.
Compared with children with other major surgery in
infancy or chronic conditions, children with BA scored
predominantly lower on physical HrQoL and largely com￾parable on psychosocial HrQoL. An explanation for the
lower physical HrQoL in children with BA compared with
other chronic conditions might be the higher burden on
a daily basis that accompanies BA. For example, children
with BA might suffer from more complications, experience
more bodily pain, or require a higher number of prescribed
drugs.
Previously, Sundaram et al assessed parent–child agree￾ment per age category and found higher agreement between
parents and older children (age > 7 years) than between
parents and younger children.30 In our cohort, agreement
(measured as ICC) on HrQoL domains between parents and
their child was moderate to high, with poorest agreement on
the behavioral scales. A systematic review of studies com￾paring parent-proxy and child self-reported HrQoL showed
that there are only moderate correlations between parent￾and child-reported domains, with a much greater agreement
in observable functioning (physical HrQoL), than in reports of
social or emotional HrQoL.48 Differences between parent and
child might be explained by the “disability paradox,” the
concept that having a chronic disease does not necessarily
mean that someone is unsatisfied with life, in contrast to
what others may anticipate.49
We are aware that our study has some limitations. First of
all, as BA is a rare disease, the sample size in the majority of
studies on HrQoL in BA patients was small. HrQoL summary
scores of children with BA were compared with summary
scores from children with chronic diseases as reported by
other studies, using t-tests. When performing multiple t-test,
the risk of a cumulative type I error increases. Therefore, the
comparison between the different patients’ groups has to be
interpreted cautiously. The majority of the studies on other
chronic diseases that used the CHQ were executed in the
United States or the Netherlands, which might have some￾what limited the representativeness of those studies. Cur￾rently, there is no validated summary score of the self￾reported CHQ domains. This hindered the exploration of
patient-related factors that might be associated with self￾reported HrQoL, and the comparison of self-reported HrQoL
between patients’ groups. We feel that international collab￾oration is warranted to confirm our findings in a larger and
longitudinal cohort of children with BA.
Conclusion
Children with BA are at risk of impaired HrQoL, especially
physical HrQoL. Special attention is warranted for children
with adverse medical events, motor impairments, or behav￾ioral problems, whom might be at increased risk of impaired
HrQoL. The results of this study will allow physicians to
provide patients and their caregivers/parents with informa￾tion on the long-term effects of BA. The development of an
intervention program to support children with BA at risk of
impaired HrQoL is warranted.
