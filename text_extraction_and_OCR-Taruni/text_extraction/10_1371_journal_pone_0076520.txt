Abstract
Gut microbiota play an important part in the pathogenesis of mucosal inflammation, such as inflammatory bowel disease
(IBD). However, owing to the complexity of the gut microbiota, our understanding of the roles of commensal and
pathogenic bacteria in the maintenance of immune homeostasis in the gut is evolving only slowly. Here, we evaluated the
role of gut microbiota and their secreting extracellular vesicles (EV) in the development of mucosal inflammation in the gut.
Experimental IBD model was established by oral application of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) to C57BL/6 mice. The
composition of gut microbiota and bacteria-derived EV in stools was evaluated by metagenome sequencing using bacterial
common primer of 16S rDNA. Metagenomics in the IBD mouse model showed that the change in stool EV composition was
more drastic, compared to the change of bacterial composition. Oral DSS application decreased the composition of EV from
Akkermansia muciniphila and Bacteroides acidifaciens in stools, whereas increased EV from TM7 phylum, especially from
species DQ777900_s and AJ400239_s. In vitro pretreatment of A. muciniphila-derived EV ameliorated the production of a pro￾inflammatory cytokine IL-6 from colon epithelial cells induced by Escherichia coli EV. Additionally, oral application of A.
muciniphila EV also protected DSS-induced IBD phenotypes, such as body weight loss, colon length, and inflammatory cell
infiltration of colon wall. Our data provides insight into the role of gut microbiota-derived EV in regulation of intestinal
immunity and homeostasis, and A. muciniphila-derived EV have protective effects in the development of DSS-induced
colitis.

Introduction
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a disease referring to the
chronic or recurring immune response and inflammation of the
intestines [1]. IBD comprises of two major types Crohn’s disease
and ulcerative colitis (UC). The cause of IBD has been elusive until
recent evidence gave substantial evidence regarding the relation￾ship between gut microbiota and the regulation of intestinal
immunity [2]. Currently, the pathogenesis of IBD is attributed to
an inappropriate and continuing immune response to normal
commensal bacteria in genetically susceptible individuals [3].
Microbiota, a diverse collection of microorganisms, appears to be
a source of antigens that the immune system responds to thus
inducing inflammation [4]. The specific antigenic properties of
microbiota and the exact mechanisms involved have yet to be
identified.
In normal individuals, gut microbiota and host create a
symbiotic relationship. The intestine is an open ecological system
that is constantly exposed to 500 to 1,000 species of commensal
bacteria [5]. It provides a suitable environment that accommo￾dates many flourishing gut microbiota communities of approxi￾mately 1014 organisms [6]. In return the microbiota acts as
moderators of a healthy epithelial gut barrier by participating in
several functions, including metabolic activities involved in
salvaging energy and absorbing nutrients, trophic effects on the
intestinal epithelial, promotion of gut maturation and integrity,
maintenance of intestinal immune homeostasis, and defense
against pathogenic bacteria [7]. Through a comprehensive
culture-independent metagenomic analysis, increasing evidence
has been found that there are significant differences in the
composition of microbiota in IBD patients and healthy individuals
[8]. Further investigation may present clues to causative and/or
protective features of microbiota in relation to IBD.
A key part to the puzzle may lie in the mechanisms of crosstalk
between microbiota and host that are involved in both health and
disease. Bacteria produce extracellular vesicles (EV), including gut
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 October 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 10 | e76520

microbiota [9]. Communication of Gram-negative bacteria is
commonly believed to occur through secretion of soluble
mediators and EV, also called by outer membrane vesicles
(OMV) [10]. Recent evidence also supports Gram-positive
bacteria to secrete EV similar to Gram-negative bacteria [11].
Collectively, EV from both Gram-positive and Gram-negative
bacteria may have a dualistic character regarding the host, some
proving to be beneficial while others detrimental. Accumulating
evidence gives support to the hypothesis that EV are involved in
the mechanisms of immunity and disease.
To our knowledge, studies on stool-derived EV have not been
reported yet. Moreover, there are no tracing data using bacterial
metagenomics. In the present study, we hypothesized that the gut
microbiota-derived EV are the key in modulating intestinal
homeostasis and dysregulation. Here, we provide evidence that
shows microbiota-derived EV to play a pivotal role in the
pathogenesis of IBD and microbiota-derived EV is an important
mediator in the maintenance of gut homeostasis.
Results
Characterization of stool EV from a dextran sulfate
sodium (DSS) colitis mouse model
Compared to other strains, C57BL/6 strain of mice shows a
higher susceptibility to DSS-induced colitis [12]. We administered
3% DSS solution to female C57BL/6 mice for a period of 5 days,
and then evaluated disease phenotypes (Fig. 1A). Starting from
the 6th day, mice treated with DSS began to lose weight rapidly so
that by day 8, the DSS treated mice showed an approximate 20%
loss of their initial body weight; the control mice showed no
significant change in weight. Compared to the average control￾group colon length of 8 cm, the average colon length of the 3%
DSS group, approximately 5 cm, was significantly shorter. Also,
disease activity index (DAI) score of the DSS group began to
increase from day 4 and rose to value of 3 by day 6. Collectively,
effective induction of colitis was achieved by administration of 3%
DSS solution to female C57BL/6 mice.
For the characterization of the gut microbe-derived fecal EV,
the EV collected daily from day 0 to day 5 were measured using
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and nanoparticle track￾ing analysis (NTA). TEM demonstrated the vesicular shape of the
samples (Fig. 1B). NTA showed that fecal EV constituted from
various origins, which explain the slight variation of average size
(Fig. 1C). Average protein yield and the protein pattern of stool￾derived EV were analyzed for the protein composition. As the days
progress from D1 to D5, there was an increase of stool-derived EV
protein yield (Fig. 1D) and protein bands in SDS-PAGE changed
(Fig. 1E) indicating a change in composition of the fecal EV.
The proportion of bacteria and bacteria-derived EV in
stools
Metagenomic analysis was used to evaluate the proportion of
bacteria and bacteria-derived EV in large intestines. Stool samples
were used to indirectly evaluate the proportion of bacteria and
bacteria-derived EV in large intestines. Since fecal EV comprise of
both host and bacteria derived EV, we amplified the EV using
indigenous 16S rDNA to exclude host cell-derived EV. Then, the
bacteria and bacteria-derived EV were assigned operational
taxonomic unit (OUT) using the amplified 16S rDNA. Over a
1000 bacterial OTU were detected; however, EV OTU stayed
well below 500 (Fig. 2A). This finding suggests that the intestines
are host to a great diversity of bacteria but not all these bacteria
produce EV, consequently bacteria-derived EV in the stools
yielding a lower diversity than its source bacteria.
The composition of fecal bacteria and EV collected on Day 0
and Day 5 were compared at taxonomic levels. In the phylum level
(Fig. 2B), there was a minor change in bacterial composition,
reflected by 16S rDNA sequencing. Actinobacteria increased from
11.1% to 18.5%, Bacteroidetes decreased from 39.7% to 35.6%,
TM7 decreased from 12.0% to 7.8%, and Firmicutes, Proteo￾bacteria, Tenericutes, Verrucomicrobia stayed relatively the same.
Interestingly, it was noted that compared to the slight shifts of
bacterial composition, stool-derived EV 16S rDNA showed more
drastic changes. Bacteroidetes decreased from 48.0% to 22.6% in
the first set and 39.4% to 4.5% in the second set; Verrucomicrobia
26.1% to 0.5% and 28.2% to 0.2%. TM7 increased from 14.3%to
56.5% in the first set and 9.6% to 56.3% in the second set. The
following showed less dramatic changes compared to the above:
Firmicutes, 8.6% to 6.1% and 0.6% to 8.6%; Proteobacteria 2.6%
to 13.8% and 22.0% to 29.2%; Tenericutes 0.2% to 0.4% and
0.0% to 0.8%. Actinobacteria EV showed almost no change. Even
though bacteria composition changed with induction of colitis, in
comparison the composition of fecal EV showed a more drastic
change.
In the level of genus and species, similar to the phylum level,
although bacteria showed shifts in composition, the change in EV
composition was more drastic (Fig. 2C and 2D). For the level of
genus and species, the vast diversity made it difficult to indicate all
the genus and species thus there was a cut-off of 1% bacterial
occupancy. In the genus level (Fig. 2C), bacterial composition that
increased in IBD included DQ532165_g, Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides,
Akkermansia, Prevotella, and EF406806_g. In contrast, EU381732_g,
EU381732_f_uc, Erysipelotrichi_uc_g, EF603943_g, Lactobacillus,
DQ326408_f_uc, EF602759_g, EF406830_g, and EF602759_f_uc
were decreased in the disease state. As for the composition of
bacteria-derived EV, DSS increased EU381732_g, EU381732_-
f_uc, EF406830_g, and Brevundimonas in one set; EU381732_g,
EU381732_f_uc, and EF406806_g in another set. In contrast, DSS
decreased EV from Bacteroides, Akkermansia, and EF602759_g in
both sets. In terms of species level (Fig. 2D), DSS increased
bacterial composition of Bifidobacterium pseudolongum, AY993113_s,
DQ532165_g_uc, and DQ815942_s; whereas decreased that of
DQ777900_s, EU381732_g_uc, Erysipelotrichi_uc_s, and
EF602759_f_uc_s. EV 16S rDNA that increased in stools included
DQ777900_s, AJ400239_s, EU381732_g_uc, EU381732_f_uc_s,
and DQ532165_g in both sets, and Brevundimonas intermedia in one
set. In contrast, oral application of 3% DSS for 5 days decreased
EV from Bacteroides acidifaciens (27.7% to 2.3% and 31.3% to 0.5%),
Akkermansia muciniphila (25.1% to 0.4% and 27.4% to 0.2%), and
EU505352_s (11.6% to 0.3% and 2.6% to 0.2%) in both sets,
The proportion of bacteria and bacteria-derived EV in
small intestinal fluids
For the characterization of EV in the small intestines, EV were
isolated from the small intestinal fluids on days 0 and 5. TEM
confirmed the vesicular shape of the EV, and protein bands in
SDS-PAGE were similar between small intestinal EV on days 0
and 5 (Fig. 3A).
Metagenome analysis was used to evaluate the proportion of
bacteria and bacteria-derived EV in small intestines. Over a 500
bacterial OTU were detected; however, EV OTU stayed below
300 (Fig. 3B). This finding suggests that the small intestines are
also host to a great diversity of bacteria, but not all these bacteria
produce EV. The composition of bacteria and EV in small
intestines collected on Day 0 and Day 5 were compared at
taxonomic levels. In the phylum level, there was a minor change in
bacterial and EV compositions on days 0 and 5; the proportion of
Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroides phyla on days 0 and 5

was 57.7% and 64.5%, 20.0% and 21.9%, and 22.0% and 11.4%,
respectively; however, the phylum Proteobacteria was the main
source of EV (97.1% and 95.5%) on days 0 and 5 (Fig. 3C).
In genus level (Fig. 3D), bacteria showed minor shifts in
composition. Predominant bacteria on both days were Turibacter
(54.2% and 54.1%), Pseudomonas (16.5% 15.3%), and EF406806_g

(6.1% and 8.1%); however, EF602759_f_uc decreased in the
disease state (9.2% to 0.7%). Similar to bacterial composition, the
change in EV composition was minor; Pseudomonas was predom￾inant (85.3% and 79.7%), and then Brevundimonas followed (4.6%
and 6.6%) on days 0 and 5. In terms of species level (Fig. 3E),
bacteria higher than a cut-off of 1% occupancy were AJ400262_s
(54.0% and 53.7%), Pseudomonas extremaustralis (9.5% and 8.2%),
EF6.2759_f_uc_s (9.2% and 0.7%), Pseudomonas panacis (5.0% and
4.5%), and Pseudomonas trivialis (1.1% and 1.2%) on days 0 and 5.
As for EV composition, EV from P. extremaustralis, P. cedrina, P.
panacis, P. trivialis, Brevundimonas vesicularis, and Escherichia coli
occupied higher than 1% of total EV; among these, EV from P.
cedrina decreased, whereas EV from P. extremaustralis, P. panacis, and
B. vesicularis mildly increased in the disease state.
Selection of candidate bacteria-derived EV based on
metagenomics
In order to visualize the distribution of bacteria and bacteria￾derived EV in stools, phylogenetic trees were drawn (Fig. 4A).
The branches were divided according to the similarity of their
sequences. The distribution and occupation of bacteria-derived
16S rDNA remained relatively unchanged. The level of EV￾derived 16S rDNA showed greater differences, compared to
bacterial 16S rDNA.
For statistical analysis of significant change in species compo￾sition, principal component analysis (PCA) was performed
(Fig. 4B). At a confidence interval of 95%, any score outside
the dotted line in the graph reflects statistical significance. 15
species were shown to have changed at a statistically significant
level. Induction of colitis similar to UC caused a greater shift in
composition of bacteria-derived EV in large intestines compared
to the minor shifts in composition of bacteria suggesting a stronger
association of IBD and EV from the gut microbiota. EV from 7
Gram-positive and 8 Gram-negative bacteria changed significantly
in the disease state. Among these, EV from B. acidifaciens (set one:
27.7% to 2.3%; set two: 31.3%to 0.5%) and A. muciniphila (set one:
25.1% to 0.4%; set two 27.4% to 0.2%) decreased at prominent
levels. In contrast, among EV from the TM7 phylum, EV derived
from species DQ777900_s and AJ400239_s increased drastically.
Bacteria-derived EV that increased as colitis progressed suggests a
complementary relationship between the disease and EV. Bacte￾ria-derived EV that had an inverse relationship with progression of
colitis may suggest a protective nature of bacteria-derived EV in
normal intestinal immunity. With the data we have presented so
far, it’s possible to conceive that in the progression of colitis, there
is a breakdown in normal immunity maintained by B. acidifaciens￾derived EV and A. muciniphila-derived EV.
The preparation and characterization of A. muciniphila￾derived EV
A. muciniphila-derived EV were chosen as our candidate in the
next part of the experiment as it is possible to culture the species in
vitro. A. muciniphila was cultured and then A. muciniphila-derived EV
were extravagated. For characterization of the EV, the EV
collected was evaluated using TEM (Fig. 5A) and NTA (Fig. 5B).
TEM showed the vesicular shape of the EV, and average size
measured using NTA was 198.13686.76 nm. To examine
immunogenicity, a murine peritoneal macrophage cell line (Raw
264.7) and gut epithelial cell line (CT26) were treated separately
with media, LPS 75 ng/ml, E. coli-derived EV 100 ng/ml, and A.
muciniphila-derived EV at concentrations of 10 ng/ml, 100 ng/ml,
and 1 mg/ml (Fig. 5C). A. muciniphila-derived EV generated
increasing IL-6 secretions in a dose-dependent manner. However,
the pro-inflammatory effect of E. coli-derived EV was much higher
than A. muciniphila-derived EV even at a greater concentration.
This indicates a pro-inflammatory effect of A. muciniphila-derived
EV; however it is weak in comparison to a pathogenic bacteria-EV
like E. coli-derived EV thus reflecting a weaker potency of A.
muciniphila-derived EV.
The protective effect of A. muciniphila-derived EV in IBD
pathogenesis
To elucidate the protective effects of A. muciniphila-derived EV, a
colon epithelial cell line (CT26) were treated with A. muciniphila￾derived EV at three different concentrations (10 ng/ml, 100 ng/
ml, and 1 mg/ml) for 12 hours, as shown in Fig. 5D. Each of the
pretreated cell line was then treated with 100 ng/ml of E. coli￾derived EV. Cells treated only with E. coli-derived EV induced a
much higher cytokine production compared to the cells pretreated
with A. muciniphila-derived EV. As the concentration of pretreated
A. muciniphila-derived EV increased, E. coli EV produced lower
amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokine.
To examine the in vivo protective effects of A. muciniphila-derived
EV on mice with colitis, 2% DSS was administered to female
C57BL/6 mice for 5 days. 2% was administered, not the original
3%, because 3% DSS proved to be too severe. There were 4 sets of
mice; mice treated only with water, treated only with 2% DSS,
treated with 2% DSS and A. muciniphila (56108 CFU/mouse), and
treated with 2% DSS and A. muciniphila-derived EV (AmEV,
100 mg/mouse). To analyze the severity of disease in each of these
sets, body weight loss, colon length at day 8, and DAI used.
Compared to the body weight loss of 2% DSS treated mice, the
DSS+AmEV group lost less weight while DSS+bacteria actually
showed more weight loss (Fig. 6A). DSS+AmEV group had a
longer colon length and a lower DAI score compared to the 2%
DSS group (Fig. 6B and 6C). Histology samples of each group
showed that epithelial stability and inflammatory cell infiltration of
the colon wall was ameliorated in the A. muciniphila-derived EV
treated group (Fig. 6D). The comparison of body weight loss,
colon length, DAI score, and histology indicated that administra￾tion of A. muciniphila-derived EV had a protective function that
ameliorated the severity of 2% DSS-induced colitis.
Discussion
Recently, we are flooded with evidence linking gut microbiota
and intestinal immunity [13–15]. Research shows a causal
relationship of dysbiosis of gut microbiota and IBD in genetically
susceptible individuals. However, there are currently no studies
involving bacteria-derived EV and its role in intestinal immunity
and IBD. Our study demonstrates that bacteria EV play an
important role as a mediator of gut immunity by presenting the
protective characteristic of bacteria EV through our candidate A.
muciniphila-derived EV in IBD. We are the first to use
metagenomic analysis to evaluate the composition and propor￾tional changes of gut bacteria-derived EV in the progression of
colitis. Using metagenomic analysis, we showed that the propor￾tions of gut bacteria-derived EV changes in the course of colitis
induced by DSS. In particular, our studies showed an inverse
proportion of stool bacteria and bacterial EV is displayed at the phylum (B), genus (C), and species (D) levels. As for genus and species, the proportion
less than 1% occupancy is noted as others.

relationship between A. muciniphila-derived EV and the severity of
colitis, suggesting an important role of A. muciniphila-derived EV in
the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis. Our studies show a
compositional change in bacteria-derived EV in the course of
colitis and suggest bacteria-derived EV profoundly influence host
immunity and participate in human health and disease.
The principles that govern host-microbiota relationship are the
focus of studies that increasingly suggest that gut microbiota￾derived EV influences intestinal immunity and participates in both
human health and disease [16]. With the complex mechanisms
involved in the host environment and microbial community
structures, it is difficult to understand this host-symbiont relation￾ship. A myriad of reports show that gut microbiota or EV have a
protective function in intestinal immunity [17–19]. Our present
study showed that compared to the control group (2% DSS treated
mice), mice treated with an oral application of 2% DSS and A.
muciniphila-derived EV showed a decrease in body weight loss,
increase in colon length, a lower DAI score, and histology that
revealed a better epithelial stability and less inflammatory cell
infiltration of the colon wall. Taken together, gut bacteria-derived
EV play an important role in maintenance of immune homeostasis
in the gut.

[20]. Many mucolytic bacteria like A. muciniphila thrive in healthy

human intestines; however, in CD and UC, there is a large
reduction in the number of these bacteria [21]. A. muciniphila is
already a well-known bacterium as a modulator for gut
homeostasis [22]. However, in our present study the DSS+bacteria
group interestingly showed an exacerbation of colitis compared to
the 2% DSS control group and DSS+AmEV group. DSS+AmEV
group showed a decrease in the severity of colitis while
DSS+bacteria group showed an increase in the severity. As
complex the interactions are between gut microbiota and host
environment, it is important to consider the reciprocal nature of
the regulation of the immune system and of microbial community
structures. In conditions of disease, as of colitis, there is a break in
the normal immunity like a disrupted gut barrier that allows
abnormal passage of gut microbiota into the host system. As in our
experiment, DSS treatments make the murine intestinal mucosal
layer thin and make the mucosal layer permeable to infiltrate
bacteria [23–26]. Gut microbiota like A. muciniphila that normally
have a protective function in gut immunity, may have a harmful
effect in conditions of a disrupted barrier. The role of microbiota
ultimately depends on the gut environment and in conditions of
colitis, application of A. muciniphila showed an adverse effect in the
progression of DSS-induced colitis. However, administration of A.
muciniphila-derived EV demonstrated a decrease in the severity of
DSS-induced colitis. While protective microbiota in normal
immune systems may have detrimental effect in disrupted host
immunity, microbiota-derived EV maintains its protective factor
in the disrupted host immunity. We are suggesting it is microbiota￾derived EV that ultimately contains the key component in
regulation of gut immunity and homeostasis.
As some bacteria are being investigated for its protective
qualities in regards to the human immunity, other microbiota have
generated interest in their pathogenic features that link them to
certain diseases [27]. The candidate division TM7 is a recently
described subgroup of Gram-positive uncultivable bacteria that
inhabit a wide range of environments [28]. Previous studies have
already shown an association of the TM7 bacterial division with
the inflammatory pathogenesis of periodontitis [29]. More recent
evidence reported a shift of TM7 bacteria in IBD patients when
compared to healthy controls [30]. It is suggested that TM7
bacteria may play an important role in IBD similar to that
previously described in oral inflammation. A change in the TM7
proportion was reflected also in our present metagenomic studies
of gut microbiota and gut microbiota-derived EV. Compared to
minor shift that occurred in bacteria composition through
metagenomic analysis, we were able to clearly show that there is
a far more dramatic increase of TM7-derived EV that suggests a
stronger correlation between colitis and bacteria-derived EV
rather than the disease and bacteria. Unfortunately, as TM7
bacterial phylum has no cultivable species, for the time being we
can only suggest the role TM7-derived EV may have in the
pathogenesis of IBD. Further studies will be needed to understand
the mechanisms that underlie the role of bacteria-derived EV in
pathogenesis of disease.
Metagenomics has emerged as a powerful tool to analyze
microbial communities and to survey the different microorganisms
in a specific environment [31,32]. Metagenomic analysis has been
previously done involving the microbial community of the
gastrointestinal tract. We are the first to use this technology to
analyze the composition of gut microbiota-derived EV. Before
metagenomics, microbes were identified by taxonomic techniques
that required cultivation of isolated strain in vitro. A majority of gut
microbiota including the TM7 phylum, are uncultivable and thus
metagenomics is a great leap into understanding genetic compo￾sition of the complete microbial population. We used metage￾nomics to survey the composition of microbiota-derived EV and
the shift in proportion of microbiota-derived EV after induction of
colitis by DSS. We were able to identify which microbiota-derived
EV increased or decreased significantly and this provided us with a
selection of candidate bacteria-derived EV.
In summary, to our knowledge we are the first use metage￾nomics analysis for a comprehensive evaluation of the gut
microbiota-derived EV composition. Our data provides insight
into the role of gut microbiota-derived EV has in regulation of
intestinal immunity and homeostasis. In an environment similar to
UC calibrated by DSS administration, some gut microbiota￾derived EV, like TM7 bacteria, proliferated indicating a patho￾genic nature and perhaps even a causal relationship with colitis.
Other gut microbiota-derived EV diminished, in particular A.
muciniphila- and B. acidifaciens-derived EV. A. muciniphila-derived EV
showed to have protective effects that staggered the severity of
colitis. Our study demonstrates the possibilities of stool-derived EV
as a biomarker and therapeutic agents. Further investigation will
lead to a more in depth understanding of the mechanisms
underlying complex interactions of microbiota-derived EV and
intestinal homeostasis and disease.
Materials and Methods
Ethics Statement
This study was carried out in strict accordance with the
recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals of the National Institute of Health. The
experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee at POSTECH, Pohang, Republic of
Korea (Permit Number: 2011-01-0027). All animal experiments
were planned in order to minimize mice suffering.
Mice
Specific pathogen free C57BL/6 mice were purchased from
Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME, US) and were bred in an
animal laboratory at POSTECH Biotech Center. Age-and sex￾matched mice were used for animal experiments.
A mouse model of DSS-induced colitis
To generate an acute colitis mouse model, DSS (36 k-50 kD;
MP Biomedicals, LLC, Illkirch, France) was added to drinking
water at a concentration of 2% or 3% (weight/volume) for mice.
Mice were exposed to DSS for 5 days. Healthy control animals
received the drinking water only. Disease activity index (DAI) was
performed in a previously published scoring system [33,34]. The
colonic tissues were processed in a paraffin cassette to stain with
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Histological activity index (HAI)
was scored in the previously described method [35]. Duplicate
experiments were performed to evaluate the therapeutic effects of
bacterial EV on the protection of IBD expression.
EV isolation and characterization
EV in small intestinal fluids, stools and culture media of A.
muciniphila were isolated by ultracentrifugation at 200,000 g for 2 h
at 4uC, as the previously described method [36]. EV was
characterized by TEM, NTA, and western blot. More details
can be found in Text S1.
Bacteria culture
A. muciniphila (ATCC BAA-835) was cultured in an anaerobic
condition that was maintained to 90% N2 and 10% CO2, the
method previously described [20].

In vitro evaluation of EV immunogenicity
Immunogenicity of EV was evaluated in colon carcinoma cells
(CT26 cells) and macrophage cell lines (Raw264.7 cells). More
details can be found in Text S1.
Metagenome sequencing
DNA was extracted from bacteria and EV in small intestinal
fluids and stools. Metagenomic studies were conducted through
high-throughput sequencing after amplification of the isolated
DNA using common bacterial 16S rDNA. More details can be
found in Text S1.
Bioinformatics
The proportion of bacteria and bacterial EV was evaluated by
phylogenetic tree generation from sequence reads. The signifi￾cance of taxonomic variation was then determined by PCA.
Statistical analysis
To confirm the difference between two groups, unpaired t-tests
were performed. For the statistical analysis to several groups, an
analysis of variance (ANOVA) and test of linearity were used. The
statistical significance was set a priori at p,0.05.
