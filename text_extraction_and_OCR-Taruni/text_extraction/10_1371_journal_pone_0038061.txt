Abstract
Renal involvement is a frequent consequence of plasma cell dyscrasias. The most common entities are light chain
amyloidosis, monoclonal immunoglobulin deposition disease and myeloma cast nephropathy. Despite a common origin,
each condition has its own unique histologic and pathophysiologic characteristic which requires a renal biopsy to
distinguish. Recent studies have shown urinary exosomes containing kidney-derived membrane and cytosolic proteins that
can be used to probe the proteomics of the entire urinary system from the glomerulus to the bladder. In this study, we
analyzed urine exosomes to determine the differences between exosomes from patients with light chain amyloidosis,
multiple myeloma, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, and non-paraproteinemia related kidney
disease controls. In patients with light chain amyloidosis, multiple myeloma and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined
significance, immunoreactive proteins corresponding to monomeric light chains were found in exosomes by western blot.
In all of the amyloidosis samples with active disease, high molecular weight immunoreactive species corresponding to
a decamer were found which were not found in exosomes from the other diseases or in amyloidosis exosomes from
patients in remission. Few or no light chains monomeric bands were found in non-paraproteinemia related kidney disease
controls. Our results showed that urinary exosomes may have tremendous potential in furthering our understanding of the
pathophysiology and diagnosis of plasma cell dyscrasia related kidney diseases.

Introduction
Immunoglobulin light chain (AL) amyloidosis is the conse￾quence of a plasma cell dyscrasia characterized by deposition of
amyloid fibrils composed of immunoglobulin light chain [1]. For
reasons incompletely understood, a small number of light chains
misfold and form protofilaments. The protofilaments then
assemble to form amyloid fibrils [2]. The processes of amyloid
formation and deposition are toxic to organs resulting in
progressive organ failure and eventual death if left untreated [3].
Since AL amyloidosis is dependent on the light chains, multiple
myeloma is not required for its development although ,20% of
AL amyloidosis cases will have .20% plasma cells in the bone
marrow. Because the source of amyloid formation is the mono￾clonal light chains, current treatments have focused on reducing
the plasma cell population [4].
Besides AL amyloidosis, the kidney can also be affected by other
plasma cell dyscrasias [5]. The most common diagnosis are
monoclonal immunoglobulin deposition disease (MIDD) and
myeloma cast nephropathy [6]. As in AL amyloidosis, the
properties of the monoclonal light chains and not the plasma cell
mass determine the kidney disease [7]. Therefore, the hematologic
parameters such as monoclonal (M) protein concentration and
bone marrow plasma cells percentage are not helpful in de￾termining the renal diagnosis. Even proteinuria and urine M￾protein spike may not accurately separate these diseases [8]. A
renal biopsy is the only certain method of making the diagnosis.
Urinary exosomes are small extracellular vesicles (,40–100 nm
in diameter) that originate from all renal epithelial cells including
glomerular podocytes, renal tubule cells and the cells lining the
ureter and bladder [9]. Exosomes are formed as part of the
multivesicular body (MVB) pathway in which intraluminal vesicles
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 June 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 6 | e38061

(ILVs) progressively accumulate during endosome maturation.
They are formed by inward budding and scission of vesicles from
the limiting endosomal membranes [10]. Exosomes are released
from the MVB lumen into the extracellular environment during
exocytosis. During this process, certain cytosolic proteins are
incorporated into the invaginating membrane and engulfed in
these vesicles, thereby maintaining the same topological orienta￾tion as the plasma membrane. Exosomes are thought to be
involved with the removal of unwanted proteins and as acellular
vehicles to transfer molecules among cells in normal and
pathologic states (e.g., HIV) [11], although the exact role of
urinary exosomes has not been elucidated yet. Numerous reports
have shown amyloidogenic precursors associated with exosomes.
Proteins associated with neurodegenerative disorders such as the
prion protein in transmission spongiform encephalopathies,
Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) in Alzheimer’s disease, and
mutations of cytosolic CuZn superoxide dismutase (SOD1)
involved in the familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) can
be incorporated into ILVs and released into the exosome-enriched
extracellular environment [10–14].
Urinary exosomes are rapidly becoming a powerful tool in the
study of renal disease. The fact that urinary exosomes are excreted
from every renal epithelial cells (from the glomerular podocytes to
the urinary epithelial cells lining the urinary drainage system)
provides us with an opportunity to study proteins once were either
difficult or impossible to reach [9,15]. Already, proteomics studies
are looking into ways of using urinary exosome to diagnose genetic
diseases and characterize disease biomarkers [16–19]. Given
exosomes’ unique insight into the intracellular environment, we
undertook this study to evaluate the possible differences that we
may observe among urinary exosomes from patients with different
plasma cells dyscrasias. Our goal is to assess the use of urinary
exosomes as a non-invasive, diagnostic tool for plasma cell
dyscrasias that will offer a snapshot of what is occurring in kidney
tissue.
Methods
Ethics Statement
Urine samples from patients with plasma cell dyscrasias were
collected. Urine came from the Myeloma Amyloid Dysproteine￾mia Disease Oriented Group urine bank that gathers waste urine
samples from patients who have given written consent for research
use of their specimens. Approval from the Mayo Institutional
Review Board was obtained in adherence with the Declaration of
Helsinki.
The urine samples were selected based on each patient’s
diagnosis. Because these were waste urine samples, the Mayo
Institutional Review board decided that no further/additional
consent was needed from the patients (after the patients signed the
initial consent form). These samples were analyzed anonymously.
This study was approved as a minimal risk study by the Mayo
Clinic Institutional Review Board.
Exosome Extraction and Fractionation
Exosomes were extracted and fractionated from urine collected
and processed as reported previously [17,20]. Briefly, 200 mL of
urine were dialyzed against distilled deionized water using
a dialysis membrane with 10,000 Da Molecular weight cutoff.
The urine was then filtered using 0.2 mm membrane and
a CompleteH EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablet and 0.02%
NaN3 were added before the sample was stored at 4uC until it
was processed the next day. The sample was then centrifuged at
45,000 rpm in a T-647.5 rotor for 2 hours at 4uC. The glassy
pellet was then resuspended in 0.25 mL of 0.25 M sucrose in
20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5 with CompleteH EDTA-free protease
inhibitor. The suspension was sonicated in a cup-horned
sonicator (550 sonic dismembranator) for 15 seconds. Crude
exosome samples were processed for further exosome fraction￾ation using a D2O sucrose gradient [17]. Two 5–30% sucrose
Deuterium oxide gradients were prepared and overlaid with
0.125 mL of crude exosome preparation and then centrifuged at
40,000 rpm for 24 hours. 6 mm fractions were removed from the
gradient using a Biocomp H Gradient Station (Biocomp,
Canada), the fractions were collected and aliquoted. A portion
of the fractions was stored at 4uC for immediate analysis while
most of the sample was stored at –80uC.
Western Blotting
We blotted the fresh fractions using the sheep free kappa or
lambda light chain antibodies (1:500) from The Binding Site, Inc.
(San Diego, CA). For polycystin 1, a mouse monoclonal antibody
generated in the Mayo Polycystic Kidney Disease laboratory,
antibody7e12 (anti-LRR PC1) (1:500) was used. Glomerular
exosomes were identified with the rabbit anti-podocin antibody
(1:2000) from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Intact immunoglobulins
(IgG) were identified using the polyclonal anti human-IgG-HRP
antibody from the SPIFE IgG IEF kit (Helena Laboratories,
Beaumont, Texas).
Immuno-gold Electron Microscopy
Immuno-gold electron microscopy was performed as previously
reported [21]. Freshly prepared exosome specimens were loaded
on 300 mesh copper formvar/carbon grids and incubated with
sheep anti human kappa or lambda free light chain antibody from
The Binding Site, Inc (1/10 and 1/20 dilution) in phosphate
buffered saline at 4uC overnight. The grids were then incubated
with a 10 nm anti-sheep immunoglobulin G gold secondary
antibody (1/30 dilution) for 2 hours at room temperature. After
washing, the specimens were further fixed in 1% glutaraldehyde/
PBS, and stained and embedded with 2% methylcellulose solution
containing 0.4% uranyl acetate for 5 min. Specimens then air
dried and were imaged with a JEOL 1400 transmission electron
microscope operating at 80 kV.
Proteomics Analysis
The SDS-PAGE gel bands are prepared for mass spectrom￾etry analysis using the following procedures. Silver stained gel
bands are destained with 15 mM potassium ferricyanide and
50 mM sodium thiosulfate in water until clear, then rinsed with
water several times to remove all color [22]. The bands are
reduced with 30 mM DTT/50 mM Tris, pH 8.1 at 55uC for
40 minutes and alkylated with 40 mM iodoacetamide at room
temperature for 40 minutes in the dark. Proteins are digested
in-situ with 30 mL (0.004 mg/L) trypsin (Promega Corporation,
Madison WI) in 20 mM Tris pH 8.1/0.0002% Zwittergent 3–
16, at 37uC overnight, followed by peptide extraction with
40 mL of 2% trifluoroacetic acid, then 60 mL of acetonitrile.
The pooled extracts are concentrated to less than 5 mL on
a SpeedVac spinning concentrator (Savant Instruments, Hol￾brook NY) and then brought up in 0.15% formic acid/0.05%
trifluoroacetic acid for protein identification by nano-flow liquid
chromatography electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (na￾noLC-ESI-MS/MS) using a ThermoFinnigan LTQ Orbitrap
Hybrid Mass Spectrometer (ThermoElectron Bremen, Germany)
coupled to an Eksigent nanoLC-2D HPLC system (Eksigent,
Dublin, CA). The digest peptide mixture is loaded onto
a 250 nL OPTI-PAK trap (Optimize Technologies, Oregon

City, OR) custom packed with Michrom Magic C8 solid phase
(Michrom Bioresources, Auburn, CA). Chromatography is
performed using 0.2% formic acid in both the A solvent
(98%water/2%acetonitrile) and B solvent (80% acetonitrile/10%
isopropanol/10% water), and running a 5%B to 45%B gradient
over 60 minutes at 350 nL/min through a Michrom Magic C18
(75 mm6150 mm) packed tip capillary column. The LTQ
Orbitrap mass spectrometer experiment is set to perform a FT
full scan from 375–1600 m/z with resolution set at 60,000 (at
400 m/z), followed by linear ion trap MS/MS scans on the top
four [M+2H] 2+ or [M+3H] 3+ ions. Dynamic exclusion is set to
2 repeats of the same ion which is then placed on an exclusion
list for 20 seconds. The lock-mass option is enabled for the FT
full scans using the ambient air polydimethylcyclosiloxane
(PCM) ion of m/z = 355.069933 for real time internal calibra￾tion giving ,2 ppm mass tolerances of the precursor masses
[23].
Database searching. Tandem mass spectra were extracted
and charge state deconvoluted by BioWorks version 3.2.
Deisotoping was not performed. All MS/MS samples were
analyzed using Mascot (Matrix Science, London, UK; version
2.2.04), Sequest (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA; version 27, rev.
12) and X! Tandem (www.thegpm.org; version 2006. 09.15.3). X!
Tandem was set up to search the SprotProt plus reverse database
(Feb. 22, 2008, 699052 entries) assuming the digestion enzyme
semiTrypsin. Sequest was set up to search the SprotProt plus
reverse database (Feb. 22, 2008, 699052 entries) also assuming
trypsin. Mascot was set up to search the SprotProt plus reverse
database (Feb. 22, 2008, 699052 entries) assuming the digestion
enzyme trypsin. Mascot and X! Tandem were searched with
a fragment ion mass tolerance of 0.80 Da and a parent ion
tolerance of 10.0 PPM. Sequest was searched with a fragment ion
mass tolerance of 0.80 Da and a parent ion tolerance of 0.011 Da.
Oxidation of methionine and iodoacetamide derivative of cysteine
were specified in Mascot, Sequest and X! Tandem as variable
modifications.
Criteria for protein identification. Scaffold (version Scaf￾fold-2_00_02, Proteome Software Inc., Portland, OR) is used to
validate MS/MS based peptide and protein identifications.
Peptide identifications are accepted if they can be established at
greater than 95.0% probability as specified by the Peptide Prophet
algorithm [24]. Protein identifications are accepted if they can be
established at greater than 95.0% probability and contain at least
2 identified peptides. Protein probabilities are assigned by the
Protein Prophet algorithm [25]. Proteins that contained similar
peptides and could not be differentiated based on MS/MS analysis
alone were grouped to satisfy the principles of parsimony. In the
case of AL-ex 1, the sequence obtained from the plasma cell
cDNA was incorporated into the database for more accurate
peptide identification.
Results
Urine samples were collected from 8 AL amyloidosis patients (4
with monoclonal IgG or IgM protein and 4 with either l or k
monoclonal protein), 5 MM patients and 5 control patients
(Table 1). The control group consisted of 1 normal, 2 patients
with monoclonal gammopathy with undetermined significance
(MGUS) and 1 patient with IgA nephropathy and 1 membranous
glomerulonephritis. The diagnosis for the AL amyloidosis was
confirmed by renal biopsy using standard immunohistochemistry
techniques. One MM patient had cast nephropathy confirmed on
her renal biopsy. The other MM patients with normal renal
function did not undergo a renal biopsy.
Fresh gradient fractions containing different populations of
exosomes were evaluated by Western blotting using free light

chain and other antibodies. Fraction 5 and 6 were positive for
podocin suggesting a glomerular origin (see figure S1). Pre￾viously published data had shown that fraction 2 corresponds to
collecting ducts with immunoreactivity to aquaporin-2 and
fractions 8–10 correspond to distal tubule exosomes with
polycystin-1 immunoreactive protein [17]. The polycystin-1
immunoreactivity was confirmed in one patient in this study
(data not shown).
The SDS-PAGE western blots showed that free light chains
were present in exosomes from all AL, MM, one of the proteinuria
patients, one of the MGUS patients, and the IgA nephropathy
control (Figures 1, 2, 3). Free light chain bands were not identified
in Control -ex4 and -ex5 (not shown). All samples showed that the
majority of the exosome fractions had the expected 25 kDa band
corresponding to the light chain monomer although the fractions
containing the highest concentration of monoclonal light chain
protein varied among the different diseases. The majority of AL
amyloidosis samples showed the highest concentration of light
chains in fraction 4–6. While the MM sample had the highest
concentration in fraction 2, control-ex1 (membranous glomerulo￾nephritis) has the highest concentration in fraction 5, while
Control-ex2 (IgGl MGUS) has high concentration in fractions 1
and 5. While the urine volume processed for each patient
remained constant, the crude exosome pellet appeared to be
different from sample to sample. It is also clear from figure 1 and 2
that the amount of immunoreactive protein found in the exosomes
varies from patient to patient. Some exosome samples caused large
perturbations in the gels (figure 2D, 2E, for example). These

perturbations may be caused by specific properties associated with
the exosomes from these particular patients.
Selective proteomics analysis was done analyzing slices from 1D
SDS-PAGE gels representing all molecular weights. We found
peptides corresponding to the monoclonal light chain in fraction 5
for AL-ex1 in all slices of the gel, while control-ex5 proteomic
analysis only showed polyclonal peptides, mostly corresponding to
the light chain constant domain in slices corresponding to
a molecular weight of 25 kDa.
In AL exosome samples AL-ex1-AL-ex5, high molecular weight
bands with immunoreactive for light chains were present in
fractions 4–6. The maximum molecular weight detected was
around 250 kDa corresponding to a light chain decamer. These
high molecular weight bands were not detected in the SDS-PAGE
western blots of the MM, MGUS or controls. For samples AL-ex6
and AL-ex7, these high molecular weight species were only found
in the crude exosome preparations. Occasionally, dimers
(,50 kDa) were detected in patients with monoclonal lambda
light chains which were expected since lambda can exist in dimeric
state. In order to ensure that the light chain species we observed
were not coming from the non-pathologic light chains, western
blots were performed using antibodies against the alternative light
chain (lambda for monoclonal kappa and kappa) for monoclonal
lambda) and no immunoreactivity was detected in the selected
samples tested, suggesting these bands were composed of the
monoclonal light chains (figure S2). Another important control we
ran was related to the high molecular weight bands that we
observed in the AL amyloidosis samples. In order to confirm that
these high molecular weight bands were composed exclusively of
immunoglobulin light chains and not heavy chains, 4–15%
polyacrylamide gradient gels were used on fraction 5 of selected
AL samples and fraction 2 of the MM samples to better separate
the high molecular weight bands. A western blot was then
performed using a polyclonal antibody against human IgG. IgG
was detected at 50 kDa (heavy chain only) and 150 kDa (intact
immunoglobulin) in the AL patients (AL-ex1, AL-ex2 and AL-ex4)
whose monoclonal protein contained a monoclonal IgG along
with a monoclonal light chain (figure S3). No bands were detected
at 250 kDa (which correspond to the light chain decamer). No IgG
molecules were detected in AL-3 (used as the lambda control), in
agreement with the finding that this patient only has monoclonal
lambda light chain. Faint cross reactivity with AL-ex5 (IgM heavy
chain) was detected, possibly due to the denaturing nature of the
SDS-PAGE gels. The 5 MM samples in our study did not show
any immunoreactivity with the IgG antibody by western blotting.
No high molecular weight bands were detected in AL-ex8. This
was a patient in complete hematologic and near complete renal
response 4 years after a successful autologous stem cell trans￾plantation.
Electron microscopy (EM) images of normal exosomes control￾ex5 showed that the morphology of these exosomes is similar to
the previously reported ‘deflated football’ with concave and
convex surfaces (Figure 4). Immuno-gold EM analysis using the
same free light chain antibodies used in the western blots showed
light chains on the surface of AL and MM exosomes. Fraction 5
and fraction 9 were imaged for AL-ex2 exosomes. In fraction 5,
where the SDS-resistant oligomeric species were found by western
blot, a high concentration of light chains was present on the
membrane of exosomes to the extent that it was difficult to find the
membrane limits. In most cases, there was a homogeneous free
light chain distribution on ‘deflated football’ AL exosomes
(Figure 5).
EM images of fraction 2, 5 and 8 of MM-ex1 exosomes were
taken for comparison. Fraction 2 had the highest concentration of
free light chain as observed by western blotting (Figure 2). It
correlated well with the amount of labeled free light chain
Figure 3. Western blot showing free light chain immuno-reactive proteins for controls. Control-ex1 is a patient with membranous
glomerulonephritis. Control-ex2 is a patient with IgGl+l MGUS. Control-ex3 is a patient with IgA nephropathy. No free light chains were detected for
control-ex4 (monoclonal l protein) or for a healthy normal control (control-ex5), so no blots are shown for these two control samples.

observed with western blot. Fraction 5 was imaged to compare it
with the fraction that contained oligomeric species in the AL
exosomes. There was much less free light chain labeling for the
MM-ex1 exosomes in this fraction compared to the AL exosomes,
and no accumulation in a particular region of the exosome
(Figure 6).
Discussion
Urinary exosomes are becoming an important tool in the study
of kidney disease [26]. In addition to their ability to enrich proteins
of interest, they provide a glimpse into regions of the kidney that
are otherwise difficult to access [27]. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first report of the use of urinary exosome in the study of
Figure 4. Collection of representative immuno-gold labeling images of patient AL-ex2 exosomes from fractions 5 and 9. Black arrows

patients with plasma cell dyscrasias, specifically patients with AL
amyloidosis.
Our study showed that urinary exosomes from patients with AL
amyloidosis and MM contain large amounts of free immunoglob￾ulin light chains, although each patient shows differences in the
amount of immunoreactive protein that appears to be consistent
with the serum free light chain protein concentration (table 1).
Controls samples from patients with MGUS, proteinuria and
healthy individuals comparatively had little to no light chain
present. The most interesting result however was the presence of
SDS-resistant high molecular weight oligomers in the exosomes of
the AL patients. These oligomers were found both in the crude
exosomal preparations (AL-ex6 and AL-ex7) as well as in the
fractions corresponding to the glomerular exosomes (AL-ex1 to
AL-ex5). Even more exciting was the lack of high molecular weight
oligomers in sample AL-ex8 who had a complete hematologic and
renal response after treatment. It suggests that high molecular
oligomers (up to a decamer) are found only in patients with active
AL amyloidosis. No high molecular weight species were found in
MM or MGUS urinary exosomes. These results are consistent
with known pathophysiology where light chains from MM stays in
its monomeric or dimeric forms while amyloidogenic light chains

form higher molecular weight structures [2,28]. In addition, the
location of light chains in the exosome fractions correlated with the
location on the site of kidney injury. Light chains were most
prominent in fraction 5 and 6 of AL exosomes which stained
positive for podocin indicating a glomerular origin. The exosomes
fraction in MM showed that most of the light chains were in the
distal tubular/collecting duct [28]. The control samples show
a more diverse phenotype, possibly due to the fact that these
samples came from patients with different conditions and
therefore, the fraction with the largest amount of light chain
reflected more of the unique condition the control patients suffer.
Our results also confirmed that the high molecular bands we
observed are made up of the pathologic light chain and not heavy
chain.
Our data were consistent the previous experimental results on
the trafficking of the glomerulopathic light chains in the kidney.
Keeling et al. showed that amyloidogenic light chains underwent
receptor mediated endocytosis and intracellular trafficking by
mesangial cells [29]. The immuno-gold and Western blot studies
clearly showed light chains were present on the surface of
exosomes. Interestingly, Keeling and co-workers also found that
amyloid fibrils were present extracellularly during their cell culture
studies [29]. This suggests that the light chains are internalized
into renal cells where the amyloid formation process begins and
the amyloid fibrils are then shuttled out of the cells. The images of
the large surface aggregates of light chains in AL exosomes may
represent this process.
The results from this study suggest that urinary exosomes may
be an excellent non-invasive tool for identifying patients with AL
amyloidosis because high molecular weight light chain oligomers
were found only in patients with AL. However, more studies are
needed to confirm our observations. Particularly, it would be
interesting to compare our results with patients with MIDD.
Unfortunately, the rarity of MIDD precluded us from including
these patients in this study. Currently, the diagnosis of AL requires
a renal biopsy. While it is generally safe, it may not always be
logistically feasible as patients may become coagulopathic from
medications [30]. Isolation of exosomes with high molecular
weight light chain oligomers would represent an enormous
advantage which can be obtained at any time. From a scientific
standpoint, the exosomes represent a miniature model of the
extracellular and intracellular processes. The oligomeric light
chain species may represent the initial steps of amyloidogenesis
captured in the urinary exosomes. When combined with mass
spectrometry and other proteomics techniques, urinary exosomes
represent tremendous potential to increase our understanding of
amyloidogenesis [27]. The potential of urinary exosomes in AL is
tremendous and deserves further studies.

Figure S3 Western blot using a polyclonal anti-IgG
antibody for selected samples. Bands of ,60 kDa,
,120 kDa and ,180 kDa were identified corresponding to
monomeric and dimeric forms of the heavy chain and intact
IgG in the control IgG sample. Bands were also identified in AL￾ex1, ex2 and ex4 in whom the monoclonal protein included the
heavy chain. In AL-ex4, who only had monoclonal l protein, no
band was identified. No immuno-reactive proteins were identified
in the MM samples.
