One of the consequences of the worldwide increase in 
overweight and obesity is the increased prevalence of non￾alcoholic fatty live disease (NAFLD). At present, the global 
prevalence of NAFLD is estimated to be ~25%, ranging 
from 31–32% in the Middle East and South America 
to 24–27% in Europe and Asia, while the prevalence in 
Africa is ~14%1
. NAFLD encompasses a spectrum of 
liver lesions that includes simple steatosis, steatohepatitis, 
fibrosis and cirrhosis. Steatosis is the main feature in the 
majority of patients with NAFLD, and these patients gen￾erally do not have a substantial risk of liver-related adverse 
outcomes2
. However, the development of nonalcoholic 
steatohepatitis (NASH) — defined by the combination of 
liver steatosis, parenchymal damage (hepatocyte apoptosis 
and ballooning, and focal necrosis), lobular and/or portal 
inflammation and a variable degree of fibrosis — occurs 
in about 20–30% of patients with NAFLD, and can lead 
to cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease2,3
. The presence 
of hepatic fibrosis is the strongest predictor of disease￾specific mortality in NASH, and the death rate ascribed 
to NASH-related cirrhosis is 12–25%3
. End-stage liver dis￾ease due to NASH is also an increasingly common indi￾cation for liver transplantation3
. Although progression of 
NAFLD to cirrhosis is more frequent among middle-aged 
(40–50 years old) and elderly people3
, NAFLD among 
obese children is associated with an increased risk of cir￾rhosis in adulthood4
. A further feature of NAFLD pro￾gression is its association with hepatocellular carcinoma 
(HCC)5,6
. NAFLD-related cirrhosis is a rising cause of 
HCC in Western countries, accounting for 10–34% of the 
known aetiologies for this cancer4
. Nonetheless, growing 
evidence suggests that ~13–49% of all HCCs develop in 
patients with noncirrhotic NASH6
. Together, these data 
indicate that NAFLD and NASH substantially contribute 
to the prevalence of cirrhosis and HCC worldwide. Such a 
scenario is forecast to worsen in the near future as a result 
of the expected rise in the prevalence of NAFLD7
.
At present, lobular inflammation that characterizes 
NASH is considered the driving force in the disease 
progression to fibrosis, cirrhosis or HCC. Nonetheless, 
the presence of steatohepatitis is also associated with an 
increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascu￾lar diseases, chronic kidney diseases and osteoporosis8
, 
suggesting that liver inflammation might also represent 
a specific contributor to extrahepatic complications. The 
current view is that innate immune mechanisms repre￾sent a key element in supporting hepatic inflammation 
in NASH9,10. However, increasing evidence points to the 
role of lymphocyte-mediated adaptive immunity as an 
additional factor that promotes liver inflammation. This 
Review discusses data regarding the role of B cells and 
CD4+
 and CD8+
 T cells in sustaining NASH progression, 
along with the possible mechanisms involved in triggering 
liver immune responses.
Innate immunity in NASH
Innate immune responses involved in NASH include the 
activation of resident Kupffer cells as well as the recruit￾ment of leukocytes, such as neutrophils, monocytes, 
natural killer (NK) and natural killer T (NKT) cells, to

Abstract | In the past decade, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become a leading cause 
of chronic liver disease and cirrhosis, as well as an important risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma 
(HCC). NAFLD encompasses a spectrum of liver lesions, including simple steatosis, steatohepatitis 
and fibrosis. Although steatosis is often harmless, the lobular inflammation that characterizes 
nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is considered a driving force in the progression of NAFLD. 
The current view is that innate immune mechanisms represent a key element in supporting hepatic 
inflammation in NASH. However, increasing evidence points to the role of adaptive immunity as 
an additional factor promoting liver inflammation. This Review discusses data regarding the role of 
B cells and T cells in sustaining the progression of NASH to fibrosis and HCC, along with the findings 
that antigens originating from oxidative stress act as a trigger for immune responses. We also 
highlight the mechanisms affecting liver immune tolerance in the setting of steatohepatitis that 
favour lymphocyte activation. Finally, we analyse emerging evidence concerning the possible 
application of immune modulating treatments in NASH therapy.

the liver. In turn, these cells contribute to inflamma￾tion by releasing cytokines, chemokines, eicosanoids, 
nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species9,10. It is out￾side the scope of this review to discuss in detail the 
role of innate immunity in NALFD. Nonetheless, a 
few aspects deserve a short mention in relation to the 
interplay between the mechanisms of innate and adap￾tive immunity. Several pro-inflammatory mechanisms 
operate in NAFLD and modulate its evolution9–11. For 
instance, as a result of insulin resistance, the excess 
of circulating free fatty acids and cholesterol directly 
stimulates Kupffer cells10–12. Within hepatocytes, free 
fatty acids not only cause endoplasmic reticulum stress 
and lipotoxicity13 but, by activating stress-responsive 
kinases (JNK1 and JNK2), favour the production of 
pro-inflammatory cytokines and microvesicles, which 
stimulate macrophage activation13–15.
Oxidative stress is also a common feature of NAFLD 
and NASH16, and reactive oxygen species can stimu￾late inflammasome activation17. In addition, lipid per￾oxidation products generated by oxidative stress act 
as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) 
in triggering Toll-like receptor signalling18. Moreover, 
studies have shown that gut dysbiosis associated with 
obesity promotes Kupffer cell activation through 
increased enteral absorption of bacterial products19. 
As a result, the release of chemokines (CC-chemokine 
ligand 1 (CCL1), CCL2 and CCL5) recruits infiltrating 
monocytes that further contribute to the production of 
pro-inflammatory mediators and to oxidative damage 
by differentiating into M1 activated macrophages20. 
In line with these findings, blocking CCL2 and CCL5 
signalling ameliorated experimental NASH21 and 
reduced fibrosis evolution in a phase II clinical trial22. 
On the other hand, blocking anti-inflammatory media￾tors that control macrophage responses worsens NASH 
evolution23,24. Although these pro-inflammatory mech￾anisms might contribute to the evolution of NAFLD11, 
they do not explain why only a fraction of patients with 
steatosis develop hepatic inflammation and they do not 
fully account for the increase in the risk of extrahepatic 
complications among patients with NASH.
Lymphocyte involvement in NASH
One of the histological features of NASH is diffuse 
lobular infiltration by lymphocytes25. These cells are 
also an important component of periportal infiltrates 
associated with NASH ductular reactions26. In ~60% of 
patients with NASH, B cells and T cells form focal aggre￾gates27, resembling ectopic lymphoid structures28 (Fig. 1). 
Interestingly, the size and prevalence of these aggregates 
positively correlate with lobular inflammation and fibro￾sis scores27. Hepatic infiltration by B cells and CD4+ and 
CD8+ T cells is also evident in different experimental 
models of NASH, in which it parallels with worsen￾ing parenchymal injury and lobular inflammation29–33. 
These T cells express the memory or effector markers 
CD25, CD44 and CD69, along with enhanced produc￾tion of the cytokine LIGHT (also known as TNFSF14), 
indicating their functional activation29,30,33. Conversely, 
steatosis, parenchymal injury and lobular inflammation 
induced by long-term feeding with choline-deficient 
high-fat diet are greatly reduced in Rag1–/– mice, which 
lack mature B cells, T cells and NKT cells and are 
unable to mount adaptive immune responses30. The pre￾vention of hepatic steatosis in Rag1–/– mice seems to be 
unrelated to metabolic abnormalities, insulin resistance 
or changes in gut microbiota, but instead is related to 
LIGHT-mediated stimulation of fatty acid uptake by 
hepatocytes30. Consistent with this finding, LIGHT 
deficiency improves insulin resistance, hepatic glu￾cose tolerance and reduces liver inflammation in mice 
receiving NASH-inducing diets30,31.
Liver lymphocyte infiltration and ectopic lymphoid 
structures are also evident in association with severe 
steatohepatitis and fibrosis following the administra￾tion of a high-fat diet to mice carrying a hepatocyte 
specific deletion of TCPTP (T cell protein tyrosine 
phosphatase) (AlbCre;Ptpn2fl/fl), which is responsible 
for the nuclear dephosphorylation of the transcription 
factors signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 
(STAT1), STAT3 and STAT5 (ref.
33). According to this 
study, liver lymphocyte recruitment in AlbCre;Ptpn2fl/fl
mice with NASH depends on the specific stimulation of 
hepatocyte STAT1 activity, which promotes production 
of the lymphocyte chemokine CXC-chemokine ligand 9 
(CXCL9)33. In this setting, reducing STAT1 but not 
STAT3 activation lowers CXCL9 expression, corrects 
the hepatic recruitment of activated CD4+ and CD8+
T cells and ameliorates fibrosis33. Interestingly, greater 
expression of CXCL9 as well as STAT1 and STAT3 target 
genes fibrinogen-like 1 (FGL1) and lipocalin-2 (LCN2) 
is observed in the livers of obese patients with NAFLD 
compared with those without steatosis, whereas expres￾sion of FGL1 and CXCL9 further increases in the livers 
of obese patients with NASH33. CD4+ T cell recruitment 
in NASH also involves the hepatic production of vascu￾lar adhesion protein 1 (VAP1), an amino-oxidase con￾stitutively expressed on human hepatic endothelium. 
Levels of circulating VAP1 are higher in patients with 
NASH than in patients with NAFLD or healthy control 
individuals, and are associated with increased severity of 
hepatic inflammation and fibrosis32.
Role of CD4+ T helper cells. The recruitment of CD4+
T helper cells to the liver is observed in several experi￾mental models of steatohepatitis as well as in patients 
with NASH29,30,32–37. From a functional point of view, the 
polarization of CD4+
 T cells as IFNγ-producing T helper 1 
(TH1) cells has been documented along with increased

expression of the TH1 transcription factor T-bet29,34
(Table 1). In the same vein, IFNγ-deficient mice develop 
less steatohepatitis and fibrosis than wild-type litter￾mates when fed with a methionine–choline deficient 
(MCD) diet35. These findings are supported by clinical 
observations that both paediatric and adult patients 
with NASH are characterized by an increase in levels of 
liver and circulating IFNγ-producing CD4+ T cells36,37. 
Moreover, in adult patients with NASH, plasma IFNγ 
levels positively correlate with the number and size 
of hepatic lymphocyte aggregates as well as with the 
severity of fibrosis27.
In response to inflammatory stimuli, CD4+
 T cells can 
also differentiate to type 17 T helper (TH17) cells, which 
are characterized by the expression of the nuclear recep￾tor retinoic acid-related orphan receptor-γt and by the 
production of IL-17 and, to a lesser extent, IL-21, IL-22, 
IFNγ and TNF38. The IL-17 family (IL-17A–F) is a group 
of structurally related cytokines that have been impli￾cated in the pathogenesis of both acute and chronic liver 
injury39. The possible involvement of TH17 cells in NASH 
emerges from the observation that liver and circulating 
TH17 cells are increased in patients with NAFLD and/or 
NASH along with levels of TH1 cells40. Interestingly, the 
progression from NAFLD to NASH is associated with a 
pronounced accumulation of TH17 cells in the liver, and 
these changes normalize 1 year after bariatric surgery in 
parallel with improvement in NASH40. In rodents receiv￾ing high-fat or MCD diets, a deficiency of IL-17A, IL-17F 
or IL-17A receptor (IL-17RA) results in increased stea￾tosis but reduced steatohepatitis41,42. This uncoupling of 
steatosis from steatohepatitis involves a decrease in T cell 
and macrophage recruitment to the liver and reduced 
production of pro-inflammatory mediators42. Similarly, 
TH17 cells and IL-17A are required for the development 
of fat inflammation, insulin resistance and steatohepa￾titis in mice overexpressing the hepatic unconventional 
prefoldin RPB5 interactor 1 (URI), which is postulated 
to couple nutrient surplus to inflammation43. In these 
animals, the capacity of inflammatory cells to respond to 
IL-17 seems to be critical, as genetic ablation of IL-17RA 
in myeloid cells prevents development of NASH43. 
On the other hand, IL-17+CD4+ T cells are unchanged 
in AlbCre;Ptpn2fl/fl mice with NASH despite exten￾sive liver infiltration by CD4+ TH1 cells and activated 
CD8+ T cells33.
The complex role of TH17 cells in NASH is further 
evidenced by time-course experiments in mice receiving 
the MCD diet. In these animals, the prevalence of liver 
TH17 cells fluctuates during disease evolution, peaking 
at the onset of steatohepatitis and then in the late phase 
of the disease44. Opposite variations are evident for intra￾hepatic IL-22-producing CD4+ T cells (TH22), which 
are prevalent between the first and second expansion of 
TH17 cells44. Extensive hepatic infiltration of TH22 cells is 
also evident in MCD-fed IL-17-deficient (Il17−/−) mice, 
which display milder steatohepatitis than wild-type 
MCD-fed mice44. These observations and the hepato￾protective action ascribed to IL-22 (ref.
39) suggest a 
possible antagonist action between TH17 and TH22 lym￾phocytes in modulating NASH. Indeed, IL-17 and IL-22 
deficiencies have been shown to exert opposite effects in 
the development of experimental fibrosis39. Moreover, 
in vitro, hepatocyte supplementation with IL-17 exac￾erbates lipotoxicity induced by palmitate, while IL-22 
prevents it by inhibiting JNK1 and JNK2 through the 
action of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). However, 
the effects of IL-22 are evident only in the absence of 
IL-17, as IL-17 upregulates the PI3K–AKT antago￾nist phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN)44. 
Consistently, Il-17−/− mice fed with the MCD diet dis￾play decreased activation of liver JNK1 and JNK2 and 
reduced expression of PTEN compared with wild-type 
mice44. Thus, the actual impact of TH17 cell responses in 
NASH evolution is probably influenced by the concom￾itant differentiation of CD4+ TH22 cells as well as by the 
fact that γδ T cells also account for the production of 
IL-17A in livers with steatohepatitis45. Altogether, these 
data indicate that hepatic infiltration by TH1 cells and 
possibly CD4+ TH17 cells can substantially contribute 
to the mechanisms supporting lobular inflammation 
during NASH evolution (Table 1).
Role of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. The evolution of NAFLD 
and NASH in both humans and mice is accompanied 
by an increase in the prevalence of activated cytotoxic 
CD8+ T cells in the liver29,30,33,46. These cells are mainly 
recruited in response to signals mediated by IFNα and 
they promote insulin resistance and liver glucose metab￾olism in mice receiving a high-fat diet46. In the same way, 
β2m–/– mice lacking CD8+ T cells and NKT cells are pro￾tected from both steatosis and NASH when fed with a 
choline-deficient high-fat diet, which is associated with 
reduced production of LIGHT by CD8+
 T cells and NKT 
cells30. The selective ablation of CD8+
 T cells is also effec￾tive in ameliorating steatohepatitis in wild-type mice 
receiving a high-fat, high-carbohydrate (HF–HC) diet47, 
suggesting an actual role in the pathogenesis of NASH 
(Table 1). Nonetheless, additional studies are required to

better characterize CD8+ T cell function in relation to 
disease progression.
Role of B cells. In addition to T cells, B cells are detectable 
within inflammatory infiltrates in liver biopsy samples 
from patients with NASH27,33. In mouse models of NASH, 
we observed that B cells were activated in parallel with 
the onset of steatohepatitis and matured to plasmablasts 
and plasma cells27. Mouse liver B cells mainly consist of 
bone-marrow-derived mature B220+IgM+CD23+CD43–
B2 cells resembling spleen follicular B cells. However, 
a small fraction of B220+IgM+CD23–
CD43+ B1 cells 
is also detectable48. The functions of these two B cell 
subsets are not overlapping. On antigen stimulation, 
B1 cells mature in a T cell-independent manner to 
plasma cells producing IgM natural antibodies49. Natural 
antibodies are pre-existing germline-encoded antibod￾ies with a broad specificity to pathogens, but which are 
also able to crossreact with endogenous antigens, such 
as oxidized phospholipids and proteins adducted by 
the end products of lipid peroxidation49. Conversely, the 
B2 subset requires T helper cells to proliferate and 
undergo antibody isotype class switching, which leads 
to plasma cells producing highly antigen-specific 
IgA, IgG or IgE49.
In mice with NASH, the B cell response involves 
CD43–
CD23+ B2 cells and is accompanied by upreg￾ulation of the hepatic expression of B cell-activating 
factor (BAFF)28, one of the cytokines that drives B cell 
survival and maturation49. Interestingly, circulating 
levels of BAFF are higher in patients with NASH than 
in those with simple steatosis, and levels correlate with 
the severity of steatohepatitis and fibrosis50. Selective 
B2 cell depletion in mice overexpressing a soluble form 
of the BAFF–APRIL receptor transmembrane activa￾tor and cyclophilin ligand interactor (TACI) prevents 
plasma cell maturation. Furthermore, these mice have 
mild steatohepatitis and less fibrosis when receiving 
NASH-inducing diets27. The contribution of B cells to 
the progression of NASH can be ascribed to the produc￾tion of pro-inflammatory mediators51 as well as to their 
antigen-presenting capabilities52 (Table 1). In this respect, 
B cell activation in patients with NASH is associated 
with upregulation of major histocompatibility class II 
molecules in plasmablasts and precedes the recruitment 
of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells to the liver, whereas inter￾fering with B2 cells reduces TH1 cell activation of liver 
CD4+ T cells and IFNγ production27. These observa￾tions are consistent with previous studies indicating that 
B cells contribute to autoimmune hepatitis53 and liver 
fibrogenesis48,54.
The pro-fibrogenic role of B cells is postulated to 
involve the production of pro-inflammatory medi￾ators that stimulate hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and 
liver macrophages54. In turn, activated HSCs support liver 
B cell survival and maturation to plasma cells by secret￾ing retinoic acid54. So far, the clinical relevance of these 
findings has not been investigated in detail. However, 
serum levels of IgA are more frequently elevated among 
patients with NASH than in patients with simple steato￾sis, and are also an independent predictor of advanced 
liver fibrosis55. Such upregulation of IgA directly relates 
to steatohepatitis given that IgA-producing plasma cells 
are detectable in the livers of AlbCrePtpn2fl/fl mice with 
NASH fed a high-fat diet33. Improved characterization of 
the origin and antigen specificity of NAFLD-related IgA 
might enable their use as possible serological markers for 
disease progression to cirrhosis.
Notably, the involvement of adaptive immunity in 
NASH (as outlined earlier) has many analogies with the 
data concerning the role of B cells and T cells in sup￾porting insulin resistance and visceral adipose tissue 
(VAT) inflammation in obesity56. In fact, obesity in both 
rodents and humans is associated with the expansion 
and activation of VAT CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, whereas 
T cell blockage or IFNγ neutralization reduce fat inflam￾mation and insulin resistance56. Similarly, B cells isolated 
from the VAT of obese mice show increased production 
of pro-inflammatory cytokines and promote T cell and 
macrophage activation, while a lack of B cells improves 
fat inflammation and insulin resistance56. These data 
might explain why, in several experimental models of 
NASH, interference with adaptive immunity ameliorates 
liver lipid metabolism and steatosis by improving insulin 
resistance. Altogether, these data suggest the possibility 
that, in patients with metabolic syndrome, lymphocytes 
might support VAT and liver inflammation through 
similar mechanisms.
Oxidative stress and NASH immunity
A key issue for understanding the contribution of adap￾tive immunity in the evolution of NAFLD to NASH is 
the characterization of the antigenic stimuli that trigger 
lymphocyte responses. As mentioned earlier, oxidative 
stress and lipid peroxidation are common features of 
NAFLD and NASH16. Oxidized phospholipids and reac￾tive aldehydes generated during lipid peroxidation, such 
as malondialdehyde, not only act as DAMPs in activating 
hepatic inflammation57 but also form antigenic adducts 
with cellular macromolecules known as oxidative stress￾derived epitopes (OSEs)58. OSEs are implicated in the 
stimulation of immune reactions responsible for plaque 
evolution in atherosclerosis58 and in the breaking of self￾tolerance in several autoimmune diseases such as rheu￾matoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus59. 
OSEs also include condensation products generated

by the interaction between malondialdehyde and acet￾aldehyde, known as malondialdehyde–acetaldehyde 
adducts (MAA)60.
The involvement of oxidative stress in driving 
NAFLD-associated immune responses came from 
observations that elevated titres of anti-OSE IgG were 
detectable in ~40% of adult patients with NAFLD or 
NASH in two unrelated cohorts28,61 and in 60% of chil￾dren with NASH62. In particular, anti-OSE IgGs in adults 
with NAFLD or NASH target the cyclic MAA adduct 
methyl-1,4-dihydroxypyridine-3,5-dicarbaldehyde61. 
In patients investigated so far, high titres of anti-OSE 
IgGs are associated with the severity of lobular inflam￾mation62, the prevalence of intrahepatic B cell and/or 
T cell aggregates28 and are an independent predictor of 
fibrosis61. The contribution of oxidative stress in stimu￾lating adaptive immunity in NASH is further supported 
by animal data demonstrating that humoral and cellular 
responses against OSEs are linked with hepatic inflam￾mation and parenchymal injury in a dietary rat model 
of NAFLD as well as in mice with NASH induced by the 
MCD diet29,63. In these settings, the increase in titres of 
anti-OSE IgG accompanies the maturation of liver B2 
cells to plasma cells27,29, whereas reducing lipid peroxida￾tion by supplementation with N-acetylcysteine or B2 cell 
depletion prevents antibody responses27,63. Conversely, 
mice preimmunized with malondialdehyde-adducted 
proteins, which also contain the MAA epitopes, before 
receiving the MCD diet have enhanced liver lymphocyte 
infiltration and more severe parenchymal injury, lobular 
inflammation and fibrosis29. Such an effect involves TH1 
cell activation of liver CD4+ T cells, which, by releasing 
CD40 ligand (CD154) and IFNγ, promote M1 activation 
of hepatic macrophages29. These results are consistent 
with clinical observations showing a positive correla￾tion between anti-OSE IgG and circulating IFNγ levels 
in human patients with NASH27 and strongly indicate 
that, by promoting OSE formation, hepatocyte oxidative 
stress represents an important trigger for both humoral 
and cellular immune responses in the liver (Fig. 2).
In contrast to the observations implicating OSE￾dependent immune responses in the pathogenesis 
of NASH, T15 natural IgM crossreacting with oxi￾dized phosphatidylcholine ameliorates NASH in LDL 
receptor-deficient (Ldlr–/–) mice receiving an HF–HC 
diet64. This effect seems to be related to the prevention 
of the pro-inflammatory activation of liver macrophages 
consequent to their engulfment of cholesterol-rich oxi￾dized LDLs64. An increase in IgM targeting oxidized LDL 
also accounts for the improvement in steatohepatitis 
observed in HF–HC-fed Ldlr–/– mice lacking the sialic 
acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin G (Siglec-G), 
a negative regulator of B1 cells65. Liver prevalence of B1 
cells, as well as circulating anti-OSE IgM titres, are not 
appreciably modified during the evolution of exper￾imental NASH27,29. Conversely, a study reported that 
levels of IgM targeting OSE-modified LDLs are lower in 
patients with NAFLD than in healthy control individu￾als66. The same study also showed that IgM titres against 
one of the OSE structures (P1 mimotope) inversely cor￾relate with markers of obesity, systemic inflammation 
and liver damage66.
These opposite actions of anti-OSE IgG and IgM 
show many analogies to that observed in atherosclerosis67
and obesity-associated VAT inflammation68. Thus, 
B1 and B2 cell responses might exert antagonist activi￾ties in the pathogenesis of NAFLD, with IgG-producing 
B2 cells being involved in promoting pro-inflammatory 
mechanisms, and IgM from B1 cells having a protec￾tive action (Table 1). In this scenario, reduced levels 
of anti-OSE IgM in combination with stimulation of 
OSE-responsive B2 cells and T cells might exert a syn￾ergistic action in the development of NASH-associated 
immune responses.
Innate and adaptive cell interplay
A role for adaptive immunity in NASH is compatible 
with observations concerning the importance of innate 
responses in the pathogenesis of steatohepatitis. In fact, 
the network of cytokines generated by TH1, TH17 and 
CD8+ lymphocytes provide a potent stimulus for the 
activation of M1 hepatic macrophages (Table 1) which, in 
turn, support lymphocyte functions through the release 
of a variety of mediators including IL-12, IL-23, CXCL9, 
CXCL10 and CXCL11 (ref.
20) (Fig. 2). Lymphocyte￾stimulated secretion of IL-15 and IL-18 by macrophages 
might also promote NK cell activation, which has been 
shown to modulate mechanisms of steatohepatitis 
and fibrogenesis69.
Another component of innate immunity implicated 
in NAFLD and NASH is NKT cells, which are a T cell 
subset characterized by the coexpression of T cell recep￾tor and NK cell surface receptors (NK1.1 in mice and 
CD161 or CD56 in humans)70. NKT cells recognize 
lipid antigens presented by CD1d-expressing antigen￾presenting cells (APCs) and secrete a variety of cytokines 
(IL-4, IL-10, IFNγ and TNF) that can promote TH1, TH2 
and CD4+
CD25+
 regulatory T (Treg) cell activities70. Thus, 
NKT cells can both stimulate and suppress immune 
and/or inflammatory responses. NKT cell prevalence 
within the liver varies during the course of the dis￾ease as signals mediated by IL-12 and the T cell mucin 
domain-3/galectin-9 dyad reduce the numbers of NKT 
cells in steatosis and during the early phases of steato￾hepatitis71,72. Conversely, NKT cell expansion is evident 
in advanced NASH30,73 concomitant with enhanced 
secretion of LIGHT, IFNγ, and IL-17A30,74. Interfering

improves hepatic parenchymal injury, inflammation 
and fibrosis in different experimental models of the dis￾ease30,47,74,75. The large majority (95%) of liver NKT cells 
is represented by type I or invariant NKT (iNKT) cells70. 
Interestingly, the lack of iNKT cells in Jα18–/– mice or 
their inhibition in wild-type animals treated with the 
retinoic acid receptor-γ agonist tazarotene reduces 
CD8+ T cell infiltration in the livers of these mice with 
NASH75, suggesting a strict interplay between cytotoxic 
T cells and iNKT cells in the mechanisms supporting 
steatohepatitis (Fig. 2). CXCL16 and IL-15 have been pro￾posed to expand the pool of liver NKT cells in NASH76,77, 
acting as a chemoattractant and differentiation and/or 
survival factor, respectively78. We have observed that 
boosting anti-OSE immunity in mice with NASH stimu￾lates an early expansion of the NKT pool by upregulating

hepatic expression of IL-1529. On the other hand, mice 
deficient for IL-15 or IL-15 receptor-α (IL-15Rα) are 
depleted of intrahepatic CD4+
, CD8+
 and NKT cells and, 
when receiving a high-fat diet, show milder steatosis and 
lobular inflammation than wild-type littermates79. Thus, 
IL-15 might act as a possible mediator in the signal net￾work linking adaptive and innate immune cell responses 
during the evolution of steatohepatitis (Fig. 2).

Fig. 2 | Role of oxidative stress in hepatic inflammation and parenchymal injury in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.
Liver dendritic cells and other antigen-presenting cells (APCs) present oxidative stress-derived epitopes (OSE) to CD4+
T helper (TH) cells in the context of major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II) molecules. This signal, together 
with enhanced expression of costimulatory molecules such as OX40, leads to the activation of CD4+ T cells and their 
TH1 cell or TH17 cell polarization. CD4+ TH cells also support both cytotoxic CD8+ Tcell responses and B cell maturation 
of plasma cells secreting anti-OSE IgG. In turn, B cells can promote immune-inflammatory processes by antigen 
presentation to CD4+ T cells and by producing inflammatory cytokines. IFNγ and TH1 cell cytokines also stimulate liver 
macrophages to release M1 pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (IL-12, CC-chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) and 
CXC-chemokine ligand 9 (CXCL9)) that further contribute to recruiting monocytes and lymphocytes. Macrophages 
and dendritic cells also release B cell stimulating cytokines such as B cell-activating factor (BAFF), which are critical for 
B cell maturation to plasma cells. IL-15 produced by both hepatocytes and liver macrophages favours the survival of 
CD8+ T cells and, together with CXCL16, is implicated in promoting liver natural killer T (NKT) cell differentiation and 
survival. NKT cells and CD8+ T cells can further contribute to steatohepatitis through the secretion of LIGHT and IFNγ.

Mechanisms promoting adaptive immunity
Under physiological conditions the liver has impor￾tant immunosuppressive functions inducing tolerance 
to autoantigens and antigens from ingested food or 
commensal bacteria80,81. These actions are mediated 
by a complex network of signals involving professional 
APCs, such as Kupffer cells and dendritic cells, as well 
as nonprofessional APCs including hepatocytes, hepatic 
sinusoidal endothelial cells and HSCs81. These cells pres￾ent antigens to T cells in a way that leads to T cell apop￾tosis, anergy or differentiation into CD4+CD25+FOXP3+
Treg cells81. Additional immunosuppressive signals can 
also derive from NKT and NK cells and myeloid sup￾pressor cells81. In view of the specificity of the liver envi￾ronment, the mechanisms responsible for subverting 
such tolerogenic milieu to trigger adaptive immunity in 
NASH remain underexplored.
Dendritic cells. Hepatic dendritic cells (HDCs) have an 
important role in orchestrating liver immunity. HDCs 
account for <1% of total liver myeloid cells82,83 and are dis￾tinguished into plasmacytoid and myeloid (or classical) 
subsets, with the latter further subgrouped into type 1 and 
type 2 HDCs82,83. During homeostasis, HDCs contribute 
to the tolerogenic environment of healthy livers83–85. 
However, the onset of NASH is associated with expansion 
of myeloid HDCs and acquisition of the capacity to spe￾cifically stimulate CD4+
 T cells82. This response involves a 
subset of HDCs with high lipid content86 and is probably 
triggered by Toll-like receptor 4 stimulation induced by 
HMGB1 protein released by damaged or dying hepat￾ocytes87. However, mice lacking type 1 myeloid HDCs 
display increased susceptibility to steatohepatitis88, sug￾gesting that different HDC subsets might be involved in 
disease evolution. In fact, characterization of myeloid 
HDCs expanding in NASH reveals that a substantial 
fraction of these cells expresses the fractalkine recep￾tor CX3CR1 (CX3C-chemokine receptor 1) along with 
monocyte markers, and produces high levels of TNF89, 
suggesting a role for monocyte-derived inflammatory 
dendritic cells in steatohepatitis90. In addition, interfering 
with CX3CR1 expression lowers the number of inflam￾matory HDCs and reduces both TNF production and 
hepatocyte death89. Although HDC expansion and/or 
activation probably have key roles in stimulating the 
adaptive immune response in NASH, some aspects of this 
mechanism need further clarification. A study reported 
that an unspecific HDC depletion (by administration of 
diphtheria toxin in transgenic mice expressing the toxin 
receptor under the control of the dendritic cell marker 
CD11c (CD11c-DTR)) worsens NASH-associated hepatic 
inflammation and liver injury91. These paradoxical results 
might be explained by the ablation of protective type 1 
myeloid HDCs88 or of other cells expressing CD11c, such 
as NK cells. Indeed, depletion of NK1+
DX5+
NKp46+
 NK 
cells worsens hepatic inflammation and fibrosis in mice 
receiving the MCD diet92.
A critical aspect of HDC action in NASH immu￾nity involves antigen presentation to CD4+ T helper 
cells, which, in turn, supports cytotoxic CD8+ T cell 
and B cell responses. In these settings, T cell receptor￾mediated signals are modulated by additional signals 
provided by costimulatory and coinhibitory molecules 
of the B7 and TNF families93. Although the activity of 
costimulatory molecules has an important role in trig￾gering T cell responses in VAT during obesity and in 
modulating anti-OSE immunity in atherosclerosis93,94, 
their actual role in NASH is still poorly characterized. 
In this respect, a study from 2018 (ref.
95) has shed some 
light on the involvement of OX40 (CD134) in NASH. 
OX40 is a costimulatory molecule of the TNF family 
that is largely expressed on activated T cells in both mice 
and humans96. Upon ligation by OX40 ligand (OX40L, 
CD252) which is present on APCs, OX40 promotes 
T cell responses96. In mice receiving a high-fat diet, 
OX40 and OX40L are upregulated in the livers of mice 
with NASH, and OX40 deficiency selectively lowers 
hepatic CD4+ T cell recruitment and TH1 and TH17 cell 
differentiation, ameliorating steatosis, and reducing the 
release of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate amino￾transferase and the prevalence of M1 macrophages95. 
Interestingly, levels of soluble OX40 are also increased 
in the plasma of patients with NASH, positively corre￾lating with the severity of steatohepatitis95. These data, 
along with the observation that OX40 promotes insulin 
resistance and obesity-induced CD4+ T cell responses 
in VAT97, suggest that OX40 and possibly other costim￾ulatory molecules can critically influence adaptive 
immunity in NASH.
Regulatory T cells in the liver. Treg cells in the liver have a 
key role in regulating liver immune tolerance by directly 
suppressing the proliferation and effector functions of 
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells through signals mediated by 
coinhibitory molecules such as cytotoxic T lymphocyte 
antigen 4 (CTLA-4) or by secreting IL-10 and trans￾forming growth factor-β80. Treg cells are a subset of CD4+
T cells that express the transcription factor Forkhead box 
protein 3 (FOXP3) and originate either in the thymus 
or peripheral organs. Within the liver, immunosuppres￾sive HDCs have an important role in directing naive 
CD4+ T cells to Treg cell differentiation by expressing 
membrane-bound programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 
(PD-L1) and by releasing IL-10 and kynurenine80. 
Treg cell analysis shows that levels of resting Treg cells are 
lower both in the circulation and the liver of patients 
with NAFLD than in healthy control individuals40. Such 
a reduction is more pronounced in patients with steato￾hepatitis than in patients with simple steatosis, par￾alleling TH1 and TH17 T cell expansion40. Conversely, 
levels of activated Treg cells in the liver are unchanged 
in NAFLD despite an increase in the circulating levels 
of these cells40. As a result, the liver TH17:resting Treg
ratio is able to discriminate patients with NASH from 
those with steatosis only, correlating with plasma lev￾els of cytokeratin 18 (ref.
40) (a marker of hepatocyte 
death)98. Interestingly, VAT inflammation in obesity 
is also associated with Treg depletion and TH17–Treg
cell imbalance56.
At present, the mechanisms responsible for reducing 
the numbers of Treg cells in NAFLD are poorly charac￾terized. In fatty livers, Treg cells are more susceptible to 
apoptosis in response to oxidative stress than in non￾fatty livers99. Additional mechanisms, including the

impairment of immunosuppressive functions of HDCs 
or interference with Treg cell differentiation signals medi￾ated by IL-33, might also be involved100. Imbalances in 
the secretion of adipokines by adipose tissue are addi￾tional factors that can affect Treg cells, as increased leptin 
production in obesity has been shown to reduce Treg cell 
differentiation whereas it stimulates dendritic cell acti￾vation and TH1 and TH17 polarization of CD4+ T cells101. 
The actual relevance of Treg cells in the pathogenesis of 
steatohepatitis currently remains uncertain in view 
of the conflicting data obtained in experimental stud￾ies. Reducing numbers of Treg cells in mice via combined 
deficiency of the costimulatory molecules CD80 and 
CD86 worsens adipose tissue inflammation and steato￾hepatitis induced by feeding with a high-fat diet102. By 
contrast, levels of Treg cells in the liver are unchanged in 
different models of NASH despite extensive lymphocyte 
TH1 and TH17 cell activation33,44.
Extrahepatic factors. Along with the changes in HDCs 
and Treg cells, studies in rodent models of NASH indicate 
that additional factors can affect hepatic immune toler￾ance. For instance, chronic liver inflammation induced 
by chronic CCl4 treatment or the MCD diet abolishes 
the capacity of Kupffer cells to promote liver Treg cell 
expansion and tolerogenic responses, favouring instead 
the immunogenic stimulation of antigen-specific CD4+
T cells103. Thus, by acting at the same time as DAMPs and 
immunogenic antigens, OSEs generated within hepato￾cytes can both dampen hepatic immune tolerance and 
promote their own presentation to lymphocytes by APCs, 
triggering both B cell and T cell activation18,58 (Fig. 2).
Additional mechanisms contributing to the impair￾ment of liver immune tolerance might involve altera￾tions to the gut microbiota (dysbiosis), which is evident 
in some patients with NAFLD and NASH19,104. During 
homeostasis, Kupffer cells and hepatic sinusoidal 
endothelial cells are known to respond to low levels of 
endotoxins in the portal blood by releasing IL-10 (ref.
80). 
However, intestinal bacterial overgrowth and increased 
endotoxin reabsorption into the portal circulation can 
subvert the anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive 
milieu by stimulating pro-inflammatory Kupffer cell 
activation, leading to a worsening of steatohepatitis105,106. 
Bacterial products can also directly promote hepatic 
CD8+ T cell accumulation and/or activation by inducing 
type I interferon production46. Further mechanisms by 
which dysbiosis might contribute to NASH-associated 
immune responses involve alterations in gut tolerance 
to autoantigens107 and the generation of short-chain fatty 
acids (such as acetate, propionate and butyrate) from 
carbohydrate fermentation19,83. Short-chain fatty acid 
production is increased in patients with NAFLD19,104, 
and increased faecal propionate and acetate levels are 
associated with reduced numbers of resting Treg cells as 
well as with a higher TH17:resting Treg cell ratio in the 
peripheral blood of patients with NAFLD108.
Altogether, the available evidence indicates that livers 
from patients with NAFLD might lose their tolerogenic 
environment in response to a variety of intrahepatic 
and extrahepatic stimuli (Fig. 3). In these circumstances, 
antigen presentation by both professional and non￾professional APCs, together with the upregulation of 
costimulatory signals and an inflammatory cytokine 
milieu, are the background for effective B cell and T cell 
stimulation.

Fig. 3 | Factors involved in stimulating the onset of adaptive immune responses during the evolution of nonalcoholic 
steatohepatitis. During the development of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, the combined action of damage-associated 
molecular patterns (DAMPs) released by damaged hepatocytes, oxidative stress-derived epitopes (OSEs) and pro￾inflammatory mediators affects the tolerogenic action of liver dendritic cells, Kupffer cells and sinusoidal endothelial 
cells. These changes contribute to a reduction in liver regulatory T (Treg) cells and favours the expansion and activation 
of dendritic cells. Alterations in the gut–liver axis due to dysbiosis and obesity-related changes in the adipokine network 
are additional factors that affect liver immune tolerance. As a result, enhanced antigen presentation to lymphocytes 
associated with increased expression of costimulatory molecules leads to the development of both cellular and humoral 
immune responses. APC, antigen presenting cell; SCFA, short-chain fatty acid; TH cell, T helper cell.

associated with cirrhosis5,6
. In these settings, chronic 
necroinflammatory liver damage promotes compen￾satory hepatocyte growth allowing the emergence of 
mutated cell clones that are further supported in their 
growth by inflammatory mediators109. Consistent with 
these mechanisms, steatohepatitis not only promotes 
carcinogen-induced HCCs110 but also leads to the 
spontaneous development of HCCs in mice receiv￾ing a choline-deficient diet30,111. In a similar manner, 
in transgenic mice overexpressing the urokinase 
plasminogen activator, the URI or the MYC onco￾gene, induction of NASH (via a high-fat diet) leads 
to HCC43,112,113. Unsurprisingly, adaptive immune 
responses involved in liver injury and inflammation 
also contribute to NAFLD-associated HCC. In fact, the 
lack of CD8+ T cells and NKT cells as well as interfer￾ence with LIGHT or IL-17 ameliorates both the severity 
of steatohepatitis and the prevalence of HCC in these 
mouse models30,43.
However, the overall picture is still quite confused 
owing to conflicting results. For instance, despite the 
association of CD4+ TH1 and TH17 cells with NASH 
inflammatory mechanisms27,33,35,41–44,95, one study has 
shown that the selective depletion of CD4+ T cells accel￾erates HCC growth when NASH is induced in mice 
with hepatocyte-specific overexpression of MYC113. 
In these animals, CD4+ T cell loss has been ascribed to 
mitochondrial oxidative stress resulting from disrupted 
lipid metabolism113. However, how these data relate to 
the expansion of CD4+ T cells observed in many differ￾ent models of NASH27,33,35,41–44,95, and how CD4+ T cell 
depletion can favour tumour growth, is not clear.
In a similar manner, the development of NASH￾associated HCCs in AlbCre;Ptpn2fl/fl mice carrying com￾bined STAT1–STAT3 overactivation is not corrected by 
blocking STAT1 activity, despite a dramatic reduction 
in CD4+ and CD8+ T cell recruitment and activation33. 
On the other hand, in the same strain, blocking STAT3 
prevents HCC without affecting immune responses33. 
Further conflicting data have been obtained with more 
specific reference to cytotoxic T lymphocytes. For exam￾ple, CD8+ T cell ablation promotes HCC in urokinase 
plasminogen activator-overexpressing mice receiving 
a high-fat diet114, whereas the lack of CD8+ T cells and 
NKT cells reduces tumour development in β2m–/– mice 
receiving the choline-deficient, HF–HC diet30. These 
discrepancies might be related to differences in the 
experimental models as well to the dual role played by 
immune mechanisms in HCC development. By support￾ing inflammation, adaptive immunity might contribute 
to cancer cell growth by promoting STAT3 activity in 
tumour cells. Nonetheless, tumour infiltrating T cells 
also perform important antitumoural actions that 
need to be overcome to allow cancer cell growth109. For 
instance, in both humans and mice, advanced NASH 
is characterized by the accumulation of IgA-producing 
plasma cells that suppress antitumour cytotoxic CD8+
T cells through the expression of PD-L1 and IL-10, thus 
favouring HCC emergence114. Similarly, genetic or pharma￾cological interference with IgA-producing plasma 
cells or PD-L1 blockade restores the cytotoxic activity 
of CD8+ T cells and attenuates hepatic carcinogenesis114. 
These data not only suggest a complex role of adaptive 
immunity in the pathogenesis of NAFLD-associated 
HCC, but also highlight the unresolved issue of how 
adaptive immunity is modulated at different stages of 
NASH evolution and whether immune checkpoints 
might affect disease progression.
Targeting adaptive immunity in NASH
The current development of therapies for NAFLD and 
NASH has mainly focused on modulating metabolic 
disturbances, oxidative stress and innate immunity115. 
Our knowledge regarding the involvement of B cells 
and T cells in inflammatory mechanisms of NASH is 
still incomplete, but a few studies have addressed the 
possibility of interfering with adaptive immunity as a 
novel approach for treating NASH. For instance, from 
the observation that the adhesion protein VAP1 pro￾motes liver lymphocyte recruitment in NASH, VAP-1 
neutralizing antibodies (BTT-1029) have been shown to 
reduce the severity of steatohepatitis and delay the onset 
of fibrosis in different experimental models of NASH32. 
However, this effect might also involve inhibition of 
the amine oxidase activity of VAP1 (ref.
116), which can 
promote cytotoxicity and oxidative stress by generating 
aldehydes and hydrogen peroxide. Studies have high￾lighted the role of B cells in NASH progression27 as well 
as the association between circulating levels of the B cell 
cytokine BAFF and the severity of steatohepatitis and 
fibrosis50. Notably, treatment with the BAFF-neutralizing 
monoclonal antibody Sandy-2 prevents hepatic B2 cell 
responses and ameliorates established NASH in mice27. 
The BAFF antagonist belimumab is already approved 
for the treatment of patients with systemic lupus ery￾thematous, and several other molecules with a similar 
action are under trial for the treatment of other B cell￾driven autoimmune diseases117. Thus, expanding our 
knowledge on the contribution of B cells to the patho￾genesis of NASH might lead to the use of some of these 
agents as therapeutic approaches for those patients 
with NASH in whom adaptive immune mechanisms 
contribute to hepatic inflammation.
A different approach for targeting adaptive immu￾nity in NASH relies on the possible applications of 
immunomodulatory treatments capable of stimulating 
Treg cells. For instance, the oral or nasal administration 
of antibodies targeting the T cell receptor-associated 
molecule CD3 has proved effective in ameliorating 
mouse autoimmune responses and atherosclerosis 
by inducing a specific subset of Treg cells that express 
latency-associated peptide (LAP)118,119. Accordingly, 
oral administration of the murine anti-CD3 mono￾clonal antibodies OKT3 plus β-glucosylceramide to 
obese leptin-deficient ob/ob mice induces LAP+ Treg cells 
and decreases adipose tissue inflammation along with 
liver steatosis and transaminase release120. In humans, 
OKT3 antibodies effectively downmodulate TH1–TH17 
cell responses with a concomitant increase in the expres￾sion of Treg cell markers121. Furthermore, a single-blind 
randomized placebo-controlled phase II clinical trial 
has shown that oral OKT3 administration to patients 
with biopsy-proven NASH and type 2 diabetes melli￾tus ameliorates alanine aminotransferase release, and

improves blood glucose and insulin levels121. Treg cell 
stimulation can also be achieved by the oral adminis￾tration of hyperimmune cow colostrum (Imm124-E), 
which improves insulin resistance and liver injury in 
ob/ob mice122. However, despite Imm124-E enhanc￾ing metabolic control in patients with NAFLD, it does 
not improve hepatic damage123. Altogether, these pre￾clinical and clinical data indicate that modulation of 
Treg cells has the potential to suppress inflammation in 
NASH. However, these studies are limited by the choice 
of the experimental models and the small number of 
patients investigated. Moreover, none of these studies 
has addressed the changes in immunological reactions 
associated with NASH.
The oral administration of antigens, a process known 
as oral tolerance, is emerging as an alternative way to 
downmodulate specific immune responses124. Immune 
cells of the intestinal mucosa and gut-associated lym￾phoid tissues are known to be implicated in controlling 
immune reactions to food-derived antigens and gut 
microbiota, but this ability might also be exploited to 
induce immune tolerance to specific antigens118,124. Oral 
tolerance has been used to prevent food allergies and coe￾liac disease through the stimulation of Treg cells and 
tolerogenic dendritic cells124. At present, the only report 
addressing the effects of oral tolerance in NASH concerns 
the observation that dietary supplementation of ob/ob
mice with proteins extracted from the liver of either 
ob/ob or wild-type mice improves insulin resistance and 
hepatic steatosis without affecting transaminase release 
and levels of circulating inflammatory cytokines125. 
Additional studies in this field are urgently needed, as 
induction of oral tolerance through the administration 
of suitable molecules or by modulating the gut micro￾biota might represent an effective approach for achieving 
long-term control of the immune and inflammatory 
mechanisms underlying NAFLD evolution.
Conclusions
So far, the available data point to the involvement of 
adaptive immunity in the evolution of NAFLD. CD4+
TH1 and TH17 cells are recruited within the liver at the 
onset of steatohepatitis; TH1 cytokines, and possibly 
TH17 cytokines, generated by these lymphocytes provide 
a potent stimulus for hepatic macrophages, further driv￾ing chronic liver inflammation. In turn, macrophages 
contribute to lymphocyte recruitment and/or activa￾tion through the release of IL-12, IL-23 and lympho￾cyte chemokines. In addition, effector CD8+ T cells and 
B2 cells are also involved, although the relative role of 
these cells is still not fully defined. At present, oxidative 
stress represents the best characterized trigger of NASH￾associated immune reactions. In this setting, the obser￾vation that anti-OSE IgGs are an independent risk factor 
for NASH progression to fibrosis61 suggests the possi￾bility that elevated levels of circulating anti-OSE IgGs 
can identify a subset of patients with NASH in whom 
adaptive immunity might have a key role in promoting 
steatohepatitis.
Nonetheless, several unresolved issues remain in 
understanding the mechanisms by which adaptive 
immunity can contribute to NAFLD evolution (Box 1). 
For instance, evidence suggesting that B cells and CD4+
T cells infiltrating the liver in NASH originate from mes￾enteric lymph nodes and inflamed mesenteric adipose 
tissue126,127 raises the question of how gut–liver interac￾tions influence NASH-associated adaptive immunity. 
In this setting, an additional question concerns the 
mechanism by which NAFLD affects the liver tolerogenic 
milieu to favour OSE presentation by APCs to B cells and 
T cells. Emerging evidence suggests the possibility that 
dysbiosis might have a role in this process. The charac￾terization of these mechanisms would shed some light 
on the factors that influence the interindividual vari￾ability in the onset of adaptive immune reactions among 
patients with NAFLD or NASH. In a similar manner, 
more information is required to better characterize the 
interplay between B cells, T cells and other liver myeloid 
cells including macrophages, NK and NKT cells as well as 
the possible interactions with γδ T cells, innate lymphoid 
cells and mucosal-associated invariant T cells45,128–132.
Another aspect of NAFLD-related immunity that 
deserves attention is the similarity of the antigens 
involved with those implicated in the pathogenesis of 
atherosclerosis58. In this respect, experimental stud￾ies have shown that Ldlr–/– mice fed a HF–HC diet, 
an established rodent model of atherosclerosis, also 
develop NASH. Notably, removing OSE-modified LDLs 
ameliorates both the diseases57,66,67. Given that NAFLD 
is increasingly recognized as an independent risk fac￾tor for cardiovascular diseases133, establishing whether 
anti-OSE antibodies might identify patients with 
NAFLD or NASH with specific risks for cardiovascular 
complications could be important.
In conclusion, clarifying the role of adaptive immu￾nity in NAFLD and NASH will not only enhance our 
understanding of disease pathogenesis, but will also
