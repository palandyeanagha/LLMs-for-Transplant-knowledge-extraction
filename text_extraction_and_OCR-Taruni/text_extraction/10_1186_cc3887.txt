Abstract
Introduction Goal-directed therapy (GDT) has been shown to
improve outcome when commenced before surgery. This
requires pre-operative admission to the intensive care unit (ICU).
In cardiac surgery, GDT has proved effective when commenced
after surgery. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of
post-operative GDT on the incidence of complications and
duration of hospital stay in patients undergoing general surgery.
Methods This was a randomised controlled trial with concealed
allocation. High-risk general surgical patients were allocated to
post-operative GDT to attain an oxygen delivery index of 600 ml
min-1 m-2 or to conventional management. Cardiac output was
measured by lithium indicator dilution and pulse power analysis.
Patients were followed up for 60 days.
Results Sixty-two patients were randomised to GDT and 60
patients to control treatment. The GDT group received more
intravenous colloid (1,907 SD ± 878 ml versus 1,204 SD ± 898
ml; p < 0.0001) and dopexamine (55 patients (89%) versus 1
patient (2%); p < 0.0001). Fewer GDT patients developed
complications (27 patients (44%) versus 41 patients (68%); p
= 0.003, relative risk 0.63; 95% confidence intervals 0.46 to
0.87). The number of complications per patient was also
reduced (0.7 SD ± 0.9 per patient versus 1.5 SD ± 1.5 per
patient; p = 0.002). The median duration of hospital stay in the
GDT group was significantly reduced (11 days (IQR 7 to 15)
versus 14 days (IQR 11 to 27); p = 0.001). There was no
significant difference in mortality (seven patients (11.3%) versus
nine patients (15%); p = 0.59).
Conclusion Post-operative GDT is associated with reductions
in post-operative complications and duration of hospital stay.
The beneficial effects of GDT may be achieved while avoiding
the difficulties of pre-operative ICU admission.
Introduction
Goal-directed therapy (GDT) is a term used to describe the
use of cardiac output or similar parameters to guide intrave￾nous fluid and inotropic therapy. When commenced in the pre￾operative period, this technique has been shown to improve
outcome after major general surgery [1-3]. Although the
number of post-operative deaths has changed little in recent
years [4,5], pre-operative GDT has not been introduced into
routine practice. The principal reason for this is likely to be the
limited availability of intensive care unit (ICU) facilities, but
there are also safety concerns regarding the use of the pulmo￾nary artery catheter to measure cardiac output [6].
In cardiac surgery, these problems have been addressed suc￾cessfully by commencing GDT in the immediate post-opera￾tive period [7,8] and by using the oesophageal Doppler probe
in place of the pulmonary artery catheter to measure cardiac
output [8]. Use of the oesophageal Doppler probe to guide
fluid administration during surgery is also associated with
improved outcome [9-13] Unfortunately the Doppler probe is
not readily tolerated by conscious patients, restricting use to
patients who are ventilated following surgery.
There is a need to establish whether GDT is effective when
commenced after major general surgery. This study was

undertaken to assess the effect of post-operative GDT on
complication rates and duration of hospital stay in high-risk
general surgical patients.
Materials and methods
Participants
Adult patients scheduled for major general surgery and
deemed to be at a high risk of post-operative complications
were enrolled in accordance with criteria similar to those used
in previous trials (see Additional file 1) [1,2]. Patients were
screened for eligibility by a member of the research team, who
obtained written informed consent before surgery. This study
was approved by the Local Research Ethics Committee of St
George's Healthcare National Health Service Trust.
Protocol
This was a randomised controlled, partly blind, single-centre
study conducted in the adult ICU at St George's Hospital,
London. The primary outcome measure was the incidence of
post-operative complications. Secondary outcome measures
were the duration of hospital stay and mortality. Patients were
assigned to GDT or control groups by computer-generated
random sequence. Study group assignments were placed in
serially numbered opaque envelopes. Randomisation was per￾formed by a member of the research team when surgery was
complete. Data were analysed on an intention-to-treat basis,
including all patients who were randomised (Figure 1).
Protocols for haemodynamic management during the first 8
hours after surgery are summarised in Figure 2. Patients in the
control group were administered 250 ml boluses of intrave￾nous colloid solution (Gelofusine; B Braun Medical Ltd., Shef￾field, UK) to achieve a sustained increase in central venous
pressure (CVP) of at least 2 mmHg for 20 minutes. GDT
patients received 250 ml boluses of intravenous colloid solu￾tion to achieve a sustained rise in stroke volume of at least
10% for 20 minutes. Fluid challenges were repeated if the tar￾get parameter subsequently decreased or if there was strong
clinical suspicion of persistent hypovolaemia. The GDT group
also received dopexamine up to a maximum of 1 µg kg-1 min-1
if oxygen delivery index (DO2I) did not reach 600 ml min-1 m-2
with intravenous fluid alone. The dose of dopexamine was
reduced or discontinued in patients who became tachycardic
(heart rate above 100 beats min-1 or an increase greater than
20% above baseline) or developed myocardial ischaemia
(clinical symptoms or electrocardiograph criteria). These treat￾ments were administered by a member of the research team
who was the only individual aware of study group allocation.
All other aspects of patient care were handled by clinical staff.
Dopexamine was prepared in a masked syringe for each
patient in the GDT group, while a dummy infusion (normal
saline) was prepared in a similarly masked syringe for all
patients in the control group. Cardiac output data were con￾cealed from non-research staff unless predefined criteria were
satisfied allowing the use of cardiac output data in deteriorat￾ing patients (Figure 2).
Assessments
The following parameters were monitored continuously during
the study period: electrocardiograph, pulse oximetry, invasive
arterial pressure, CVP and cardiac output. Lithium indicator
dilution and pulse power analysis was used to measure car￾diac output and to calculate DO2I (LiDCO plus system;
LiDCO Ltd., Cambridge, UK). This technique is minimally inva￾sive and well validated [14]. Arterial blood gas measurements
were performed hourly during the study period. P-POSSUM
(Portsmouth Physiologic and Operative Severity Score for the
enUmeration of Mortality and morbidity) and APACHE II
(Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II) scores
were calculated after admission to the ICU [15,16]. Patients
were followed up for 60 days. Diagnosis and management of
complications were undertaken by non-research staff. These
were verified, in accordance with predefined criteria, by a
member of the research team unaware of study group

allocation. This process involved inspection of notes, radiolog￾ical investigations, laboratory data and clinical assessment.
Statistical analysis
Assuming a two-sided type I error rate of 5% and a power of
80%, we calculated that a sample size of 300 patients would
be required to detect a reduction in the proportion of patients
developing complications from 50% in the control group to
34% in the GDT group. These values were based on the
observed incidence of complications in the control groups of
previous similar trials [1,3]. Arrangements were made pro￾spectively for interim analyses after the recruitment of 100 and
200 patients. To minimise the possibility of type I error at
interim analysis, a more stringent level of significance was
required (p < 0.01) for the trial to be stopped after interim anal￾ysis than that used for the initial power analysis (p < 0.05).
Data are presented as means (standard deviation) where nor￾mally distributed, and as median (interquartile range) where
not normally distributed. Relative risk is presented with 95%
confidence intervals. Categorical data were tested with
Fisher's exact test. Continuous data were tested with the t test
where normally distributed, and with the Mann–Whitney U test
where not normally distributed. Confidence intervals were
constructed for the difference in mean duration of stay
between the two groups by bootstrapping within treatment
groups [17]. Analysis was performed with GraphPad Prism
version 4.0. Significance was set at p < 0.05.
Results
A total of 122 patients were recruited between November
2002 and August 2004 (Figure 1). The study was stopped
early on the advice of the external safety assessor, after
assessment of data from the first 100 patients, because the
primary end-point had been achieved. By this time 62 patients
had been randomised to the GDT group and 60 patients to the
control group. The groups were well matched for age, sex,
blood loss, type of surgery and anaesthetic technique (Table
1).
The goal for DO2I was achieved by most patients in the GDT
group and spontaneously by a smaller proportion of the con￾trol group (49 patients (79%) versus 27 patients (45%); p =
0.0002; Figure 3). Patients in the GDT group received a
greater volume of colloid solution but a similar volume of blood
(Table 2). Dopexamine was administered to 55 patients in the
GDT group and, on the instruction of clinical staff, to one
patient in the control group. Despite receiving the maximum
therapy allowed by the protocol, 13 patients in the GDT group
did not achieve the goal for DO2I. In seven of these patients
the dose of dopexamine was reduced either because of tach￾ycardia (six patients) or myocardial ischaemia (one patient).
Fewer patients developed complications in the GDT group
(27 patients (44%) versus 41 patients (68%); relative risk
0.63; 95% confidence interval 0.46 to 0.87; p = 0.003). The
total number of complications per patient was also lower in the
GDT group (0.7 per patient (SD 0.9) versus 1.5 per patient
(SD 1.5); p = 0.002; Tables 3 and 4). The reduction in the
number of post-operative complications in the GDT group was
associated with a reduction in both mean duration of hospital

stay (17.5 days versus 29.5 days, 41% reduction (95% confi￾dence intervals 0 to 81); p = 0.001) and median duration of
stay (11 days (7 to 15) versus 14 days (11 to 27); p = 0.001).
There was no difference in duration of ICU stay (43 hours (24
to 102) versus 45 hours (25 to 99); p = 0.82). There were no
delays in discharge as a result of problems in organising nurs￾ing home placement or other social care. There were no signif￾icant differences in 28-day or 60-day mortality (Table 3). The
28-day mortality predicted with the P-POSSUM score was
higher for the GDT than for the control group (18.5% versus
13.7%; p = 0.09).
Discussion
This is the first study to investigate the effects of post-opera￾tive GDT in high-risk patients undergoing major general sur￾gery. The effect of the GDT protocol was to reduce the
number of patients developing complications and shorten their
hospital stay in comparison with a protocol designed to reflect
standard care. Thus, some of the beneficial effects of GDT
might still be achieved when pre-operative ICU admission is

not possible. In addition, the use of lithium indicator dilution
and pulse power analysis to measure cardiac output obviates
the need for insertion of a pulmonary artery catheter. The GDT
protocol used in this study is therefore a practical and effective
intervention.
The mortality in both groups was lower than had been pre￾dicted by the P-POSSUM score, suggesting that all patients
received a high standard of care. All patients in the control
group were admitted to the ICU and received intravenous fluid
resuscitation guided by CVP measurements. Rather than
apply an absolute target for CVP, a dynamic fluid response tar￾get of at least 2 mmHg was used. This provides a more reliable
guide to fluid requirements and avoids discrepancies arising
from differences in intrathoracic pressures between patients
who are ventilated and those who are not. In addition, cardiac
output was measured in all patients and was revealed to clini￾cal staff according to predefined criteria. It is difficult to design
a simple protocol that will account for all eventualities. Allow￾ance was therefore made for the administration of a fluid chal￾lenge where there was strong clinical suspicion of
hypovolaemia, but a fluid challenge was not mandated by the
protocol.
In several studies, GDT has been shown to improve outcome
when commenced before surgery [1-3]. However, a recent
multi-centre trial that randomised surgical patients to pulmo￾nary artery catheterisation or conventional management failed
to show a difference in outcome [18]. These findings might
have occurred as a result of several important methodological
flaws, which have been discussed elsewhere [19]. The impor￾tant differences between the present study and previous work
in general surgical patients are that the protocol was com￾menced after surgery, was only 8 hours in duration and did not
require the use of a pulmonary artery catheter. This design is
similar to two successful trials of post-operative GDT in
cardiac surgical patients [7,8]. A recent retrospective study
illustrates the continued interest in the use of peri-operative β￾blockade in high-risk surgical patients [20], although the
results of a multi-centre trial are still awaited [21]. The appar￾ent efficacy of GDT and β-blockade relates to effects on differ￾ent pathophysiological processes. Both treatments are likely

to have a role in the management of the high-risk surgical
patient.
The mechanism of the therapeutic effect of GDT remains
unclear. It may be that increased global oxygen delivery results
in increased tissue partial pressure of oxygen (PO2), with
improved tissue healing and reduced infection rates. There is
some evidence that additional intravenous fluid use improves
tissue PO2 during surgery [22] and that decreases in global
oxygen delivery and regional oxygen tension are associated
with poor tissue healing and infection [23,24]. The use of GDT
may also have financial implications. Previous studies have
shown peri-operative GDT to be associated with an overall
cost reduction [25,26]. In the present study, GDT was
associated with a 41% reduction in mean duration of hospital
stay. This suggests that the use of GDT might reduce the over￾all cost of surgical care.
There are some potential weaknesses in the design of this
study. It was a small single-centre study that was stopped
early after interim analysis of a composite end-point. These
factors limit the applicability of the findings. Recruitment was
possible only when a member of the research team was avail￾able to take informed consent before surgery and administer
the 8-hour study protocol. During the trial period, 979 surgical
patients were admitted to ICU, with a hospital mortality of
12.1%. Not all of these patients would have been eligible for
recruitment. Studies of any interventional protocol will require
at least one individual to be aware of study group allocation.
Although this does increase the possibility of bias, we took
several measures to conceal allocation from everyone except
the member of the research team delivering the protocol.
Masked infusions and identical monitoring equipment were
used for all patients. It would not have been possible for non￾research staff to identify study group allocation.
Conclusion
The use of post-operative GDT is associated with reductions
in complications and duration of hospital stay but avoids the
problems associated with pre-operative ICU admission and
pulmonary artery catheterisation. A large multi-centre trial
should be performed to validate the applicability of these find￾ings to a wider population.

Key messages
• Goal Directed Therapy has been shown to improve out￾come when commenced before surgery, but this 
approach has proved impractical.
• This study suggests that post-operative Goal Directed 
Therapy is also effective, but does not require pre-oper￾ative ICU admission.
