1. Introduction
!
The first studies on the clinical use of ultrasound contrast
agents (UCAs) with contrast specific imaging techniques were
published at the beginning of this century using Levovist® as
UCA [1, 2]. A couple of years later sulphur hexafluoride (Sono￾Vue®, Bracco, Milan) was marketed in Europe, opening the era
of real time low mechanical index (MI) contrast enhanced ul￾trasound (CEUS). The European Federation of Societies for Ul￾trasound in Medicine and Biology (EFSUMB) released the first
Guidelines on the use of CEUS in 2004 [3]. This document,
which focused mainly on liver applications, contributed to the
rapid expansion of CEUS and sanctioned the acronym “CEUS”.
CEUS was felt to be a revolutionary technique and many new
applications, besides those in the liver, were developed in the
following years. Therefore, in the update of the Clinical Recom￾mendations on the use of CEUS by the EFSUMB, published in
2008 [4], applications in some other organs were described.
Since then, there has been exponentially increasing interest in
the clinical applications of CEUS and new fields have been in￾vestigated, so that nearly all organ systems have now been
subjected to some kind of CEUS study. More than half of the
approximately 900 original investigative articles (editorials
and letters excluded) found in PubMed® under the search
term “Contrast Enhanced Ultrasound” by the end of 2010
were published after 2008, after the last update of the EF￾SUMB guidelines [4]. Therefore, in 2010 EFSUMB felt it was
the right time to start preparing a new update of the Guide￾lines. In the light of the expansion in CEUS usage, it was felt
that a new update on CEUS for liver applications would be
more beneficial to the clinical community if endorsed on a
worldwide basis. Therefore, an agreement was reached with
the World Federation of Societies for Ultrasound in Medicine
and Biology (WFUMB) to prepare joint guidelines with EF￾SUMB exclusively for liver applications, taking advantage of
its previous experience and of the previously published docu￾ment [4]. These are expected to be issued as double simulta￾neous publications in Ultraschall in der Medizin/European
Journal of Ultrasound and in Ultrasound in Medicine and Biol￾ogy. At the same time the EFSUMB Executive Bureau decided
that non-liver applications would be covered by a dedicated
ESFUMB document under the guidance of a steering commit￾tee. The steering committee chose a panel of authors on the
basis of their publication records in the various fields of inter￾est and their reputation as international experts in research
and teaching CEUS. By necessity, this list of co-authors could
include only a limited number of persons and we acknowledge
that many other highly qualified CEUS operators are active
throughout Europe and have published valuable scientific arti￾cles on different CEUS topics. EFSUMB regrets not being able
to include all of them in this process.
These Clinical Recommendations on the use of CEUS are based
on comprehensive literature surveys including results from
prospective clinical trials. In the case of topics for which no
or little significant study data were available, evidence was ob￾tained from expert committee reports or was based on the
views of experts in the field during a consensus conference
held in Frankfurt in April 2011.
As with the previous editions, these recommendations provide
general advice for the use of UCAs. They are intended to create
standard protocols for the use and administration of UCAs and
improve the patient management. Individual cases must be
managed on the basis of all clinical data available for that spe￾cific patient.
A few points are worth special mention. Many applications in￾cluded in this article continue to be off-label. UCAs registered
in Europe are licensed only for cardiac or, in the case of Sono￾Vue®, for liver, breast and vascular applications. Levovist® is
also registered for vesico-ureteric studies, but is practically no
longer marketed, and is expected ultimately no longer be
available. The current legal requirements for registration of
pharmaceutical products in Europe are strict. In order for a
new indication to be registered, the manufacturer must pro￾vide data on safety and efficacy, with a dedicated phase III
trial specifically designed to obtain that registration approval.
Diagnostic agents, including contrast microbubbles, are not ex￾empt from this rule, which is designed to protect patients
from misuse of drugs or diagnostic agents but, on some occa￾sions, may limit the potential benefit to patients. In fact, appli￾cations for indications not only follow clinical or scientific
needs, but also the financial expectations of the producer. Si￾milarly, for some products, the marketing forecast for income
from additional indications is lower than the cost of a registra￾tion trial, so that new indications, especially for some organs,
are highly unlikely to appear. However, lack of registration
does not mean lack of efficacy of a marketed compound. Hav￾ing said that, we must not forget that UCAs continue to be off￾label for many non-liver indications detailed in the present re￾commendations. This means that patients should be informed
and must consent to the investigation, and this is the respon￾sibility of the operator. Indeed, non-liver CEUS is frequently
performed on demand, to address specific questions raised in
the individual patient. This explains (and justifies!) why it is
not simple to write definitive guidelines and recommendations
for the extrahepatic applications of CEUS.
CEUS has a number of distinct advantages over CT and MRI. It
can be performed immediately, without any preliminary la￾boratory testing, and it can be carried out in a variety of sce￾narios (bedside, operating room, CT suite, etc.). Importantly
also, it operates in real time so that rapid changes can be cap￾tured.
What then is the role of the current document? Firstly, it ex￾plains rationale for proceeding with the investigation, both to
patients and clinicians, since for most situations the benefits
are clearly outlined in this article. Secondly, it reports on the
extremely rare and limited risks to which patients are exposed
when they undergo a CEUS examination. These two points to￾gether facilitate and expedite the explanation of the risk/bene￾fit ratio for the specific investigation to which a patient may
be asked to consent. One example of this is in paediatric appli￾cations, for which the EFSUMB officers have already expressed
a similar point of view [5].
Finally, based on the literature and the experts’ consensus, an
attempt was made to provide a recommendation level for each
indication. The British guidelines for reporting on this topic
have been used, as found at http://www.essentialevidence￾plus.com/product/ebm_loe.cfm?show = guidelines, accessed in
March 2011, in which the more detailed criteria of the Centre
for Evidence Based Medicine in Oxford have been incorporated
after slight adaptation (●▶ Table 1).
A: There is good research-based evidence to support the re￾commendation.
B: There is fair research-based evidence to support the recom￾mendation.

C: The recommendation is based on expert opinion and panel
consensus.
X: There is evidence that the intervention is harmful
0: We added level 0 for situations in which not enough infor￾mation was available to provide a recommendation.
In addition to the level of the recommendation (A, B, C, X or 0),
we reported the strength of the recommendation based on the
study with the highest quality supporting the recommenda￾tions, according to the classification detailed in ●▶ Table 1.
2. General Considerations
!
Any CEUS examination should be preceded by careful assess￾ment of the target with conventional B-mode US and, when
appropriate, with Doppler (spectral and/or colour/power). Be￾fore starting any CEUS examination, all relevant clinical infor￾mation, including laboratory tests and previous imaging inves￾tigations, useful for reaching the expected final diagnosis,
should be reviewed. This also helps to explain the expected
benefit of the proposed CEUS study to the patient, an impor￾tant step in obtaining consent.
Four transpulmonary UCAs are currently approved by the
European Medicines Agency for use in European countries.
The products and indications may vary on other continents.
▶ Levovist® (air with a galactose shell and palmitic acid as a sur￾factant) (Bayer-Shering Pharma AG, introduced in 1996). Pro￾duction of Levovist has been discontinued and its use is not
considered in these Recommendations.
▶ Luminity® (perflutren) (octafluoropropane with a phospholi￾pid shell) (Lantheus Medical Imaging, inc., introduced in
2006). Sole European indication to date is cardiac which is
outside the scope of these recommendations.
▶ Optison® (octafluoropropane – perflutren with an albumin
shell) (GE Healthcare Inc., introduced in 1998). Sole European
indication to date is cardiac which is outside the scope of these
recommendations.
▶ SonoVue® (sulfur hexafluoride with a phospholipid shell)
(Bracco Spa, introduced in 2001). Registered indications in
Europe are cardiac, macrovascular, liver and breast lesions.
This is the main agent in general use.
The composition, packaging, storage, indications and contrain￾dications of these agents are detailed in the respective web￾pages of the manufacturers, whose addresses can be reached
following the informations reported in Appendix 1.
Other UCAs are approved outside Europe and several more are
under investigation.
Dose of contrast agent and data storage. For SonoVue®, which
is the focus of the current document and which is the UCA used in
almost all of the referenced articles, the recommended dose is 2.4
mL. This can be increased to 4.8 mL or decreased to 1.0 mL or less
depending on the sensitivity of the equipment used, the type of
transducer and the organ under investigation. When using high￾er frequency transducers, a dose of 4.8 mL performs better. A
real-time videoclip should be recorded, preferably digitally, for
review and documentation. The clip should include at best the
whole examination or at least the most relevant parts, usually
corresponding to the initial 10 – 40 seconds starting at the onset
of enhancement with additional shorter clips taken at 2 – 3 min￾utes. Finally, either the entire clip (preferred choice) or at least
various selected most relevant frames should be stored perma￾nently [6–9].
3. Equipment
!
Contrast-specific US modes are required and are generally
based on the cancellation and/or separation of linear US sig￾nals from tissue and the utilisation of the non-linear response
from microbubbles.
The non-linear response from microbubbles arises from two
different mechanisms:

▶ Non-linear response from microbubble oscillations at low
acoustic pressure, chosen to minimize the disruption of the
microbubbles.
▶ High-energy broadband non-linear response arising from mi￾crobubble disruption.
Non-linear harmonic US signals also arise in tissues themselves
from distortion of the sound wave during its propagation
through the tissue. The extent of this tissue harmonic response
increases with the acoustic pressure, which is proportional to
the MI. The precise unit of measurement for acoustic pressure
is the Pascal, but the most common reference unit is the MI.
Minimisation of bubble disruption is the main reason for using
low MIs for real time imaging but it also reduces tissue harmo￾nics and artefacts, thus facilitating the separation of signals from
UCAs from those of tissue. Low MI is typically below 0.3, but
most equipments work well at MIs much below this (for details
see manufacturers’ recommendations or contact the manufac￾turers’ representatives). For the purpose of this document,
CEUS is defined as low MI real time contrast specific imaging,
unless otherwise specified. This is in agreement with the termi￾nology of the vast majority of the literature.
Technical information on US equipment capable of CEUS ima￾ging can be accessed via the respective webpages reachable
through the web address reported in Appendix 1. Updating
this information is the responsibility of the companies.
EFSUMB is unable to express any judgement on the quality of
particular scanners or transducers. However, the following fea￾tures should be kept in mind, as they characterise the quality
of the equipment used for CEUS examinations:
Sensitivity reflects the ability of a system to detect extremely
small amounts of microbubbles. Good sensitivity extends the
duration of useful enhancement.
When using high frequency probes, higher doses of UCA may
be needed to achieve a sufficient enhancement level, as these
frequencies are higher than those at which current UCAs reso￾nate most strongly.
The ability to image small differences in local contrast concen￾tration is a component of sensitivity. It reflects the dynamic
range of contrast performance.
Tissue suppression is mandatory to differentiate contrast en￾hancement from tissue echoes. Strongly reflective structures
such as vessel walls, the abdominal wall and gas-filled structures
can break through and appear on the CEUS part of the screen.
Resolution. As in B-mode, temporal and spatial resolution are im￾portant for CEUS imaging. Temporal resolution is defined by the
frame rate at a given line density, depth and width. A high frame
rate allows visualisation of the flow direction in arteries. It may
also produce more rapid destruction of bubbles within the acous￾tic field. Spatial resolution mainly refers to the ability to display
bubble echoes with optimal detail. Additionally, the image
should be homogeneous throughout.
Like all imaging techniques, CEUS has artefacts, mainly caused
by incorrect machine settings or UCA dosages [10]. The MI is
the most important setting for CEUS and gain is the second
one. Adequate training allows knowledge, recognition and pre￾vention of artefacts.
4. Investigator Training
!
Competence ensured by adequate training is a prerequisite to
achieve correct diagnoses when using ultrasonography and
especially CEUS. EFSUMB has defined three levels of training
in its minimal training requirements [11] (EFSUMB Appendix
14) [12] and recommends that CEUS should be performed
by operators at a competence level higher than Level 1. To en￾sure adequate training, EFSUMB started a new initiative to or￾ganise dedicated Euroson Schools on CEUS in 2009 [13].
EFSUMB advises that investigators intending to start using
CEUS spend some time under the supervision of an expert,
who is preferably at Level 3. It is important that there is a suf￾ficient number and variety of examinations in their own de￾partment. Investigators should also consult the manufacturers
to ensure that their scanner is optimised for CEUS examina￾tions. The practice of CEUS also requires knowledge of UCA
administration and contraindications and the skill to handle
possible side effects within the medico-legal framework of
their country.
5. Terminology
!
UCAs were initially developed to enhance Doppler US and any
scanner with Doppler facilities can be utilised for this. Conven￾tional Doppler US operates at a higher acoustic power than real￾time contrast-specific modes. Consequently microbubble dis￾ruption occurs at a high rate and the enhancement does not
last long (a few minutes) after bolus injection. Moreover, the
injection of contrast as a bolus often produces an initial
“blooming” effect (proportional to the amount of contrast uti￾lised), so that either smaller amounts or a continuous infusion
(1 – 2 ml per minute) may be preferable. This technique has
few applications nowadays since CEUS can provide information
either more accurately or in an easier way in most organs.
During CEUS, the screen should show only a few signals from
intensely reflective structures, such as signals generated by the
large difference in acoustic impedance between the lung and
the diaphragm (overload of the tissue suppression software).
This applies both to single-screen contrast-only displays and
to the split-screen display, where the CEUS image is shown
alongside a low MI version of conventional B-mode image. In
some equipment a single panel mixed mode is used. In these
cases, the underlying conventional B-mode image is seen, with
the CEUS overlay displayed in a different colour, potentially
with the addition of colour Doppler information.
The description of the behaviour of tissue or lesion under ex￾amination should be in terms of its enhancement, taking into
consideration its temporal behaviour, degree of enhancement,
and contrast distribution.
1. As regards the timing of enhancement, two phases are appar￾ent for most organs:
a) the arterial phase, starting from the first arrival of contrast
(usually in 10 – 20 seconds) until around 30 – 45 seconds, dur￾ing which the degree of enhancement increases progressively.
b) the venous phase which starts from approximately 30 – 45
seconds after contrast injection, during which the degree of
enhancement shows a plateau and then decreases progres￾sively until microbubble signals have disappeared completely
or fallen to the noise level. Most organs have a single blood
supply with a single inflow (namely arterial) phase, the excep￾tions being the liver, which is supplied by its artery and the
portal vein, leading to two distinct inflow phases (arterial
and portal venous) and the lungs, which are supplied by pul￾monary and bronchial arteries with different arrival times.
Piscaglia F et al. The EFSUMB Guidelines… Ultraschall in Med 2012; 33: 33–59
36 Guidelines
Downloaded by: NYU. Copyrighted material.

The liver and spleen are also exceptions in that they tend to
retain microbubbles longer than other organs, probably due
to the of trapping of microbubbles in their unique microcircu￾lations after clearance from the remainder of the macrovascu￾lature. Consequently, the wash-out phase in most organs is
shorter than in the liver and spleen, whose prolonged reten￾tion is termed the late phase. There is no precisely definable
event that allows an exact distinction between the arterial
and venous and late phases.
The time of contrast arrival is usually 10 to 20 seconds after
i. v. injection, but factors such as a slow injection of microbub￾bles in very peripheral small veins or cardiac diseases may
prolong it, whereas intracardiac or pulmonary shunting or a
hyperdynamic circulation may shorten it.
2. The degree of enhancement is difficult to assess, unless mea￾surements are made using in-built or off-line software, for ex￾ample, in the assessment of tumour response to antiangiogen￾esis treatment [14]. Generally, when the target of the study is
a focal region in a parenchymal organ, the degree of enhance￾ment should be compared to the surrounding parenchyma or
to the paired organ when available. The lesion might be rela￾tively hyperenhancing, isoenhancing, hypoenhancing or non￾enhancing and the pattern should be described separately for
the arterial and venous phases. The transition from hyper- or
iso-enhancement to hypoenhancement is commonly referred
to as “wash-out”. The use of this term for other enhancement
patterns creates confusion and should be avoided. EFSUMB re￾commends that reports on CEUS are made in terms of the de￾gree of enhancement. For targets that have no background tis￾sue to describe the relative enhancement (studies of large
vessels, endocavitary administration, or when a mass occu￾pies an entire organ, etc), it is important to describe the pre￾sence or absence of enhancement and its distribution (e. g. in
septa within a complex cystic mass or a fluid-containing struc￾ture, or blood flow where this is not expected to be present,
for instance outside an organ) whereas the degree of enhance￾ment is more difficult to assess.
3. Contrast distribution. When enhancement is seen, its distri￾bution should be described. The relevant terms have not
been predetermined and should be chosen with the aim of
characterising the tissue and reaching a diagnosis. The de￾scription of whether the enhancement is homogeneous or
heterogeneous and, in the latter case, if non-perfused regions
exist, should be included. Any further description of the en￾hancement pattern is left to the operator inspired by the re￾commendations for each organ. In general terms, the CEUS de￾piction of non-perfused (potentially necrotic or liquid) areas
might be relevant prior to any US-guided biopsy in order to
better identify the target.
6. Safety
!
In general, UCAs are very safe with a low incidence of side ef￾fects. They are not nephrotoxic and do not interact with the
thyroid gland and it is therefore not necessary to perform
laboratory tests before their administration. The incidence of
severe hypersensitivity or anaphylactoid reactions is lower
than with current X-ray agents and is comparable to that of
MR contrast agents. UCAs are not licensed in pregnancy.
Breastfeeding is a contraindication in some countries.
Life threatening anaphylactoid reactions have been reported
with a rate of less than 0.002% [15, 16]. Previous allergic/ana￾yphylactoid reaction to X-ray iodinated contrast agents does
not necessitate the prophylactic use of steroids or antihista￾mines prior to UCA injection since the two types of agent are
completely different.
There is a theoretical possibility that the interaction of diag￾nostic US and UCA could produce bioeffects. In vitro cellular
effects that have been observed include sonoporation, haemo￾lysis and cell death. Although observed in vitro, such bioeffects
may have relevance for the in vivo situation as they result
from interactions between gas bodies and cells. Data from
small animal models suggest that glomerular capillary hae￾morrhage and other microvascular rupture could occur when
microbubbles are insonated at high MI [16]. This could be in￾jurious in specific situations in which such vascular damage
would be clinically important such as in the eye and brain.
This potential for non-thermal bioeffects exists with all modes,
including conventional 2D imaging and 3D methods. The MI
provides a useful, albeit very rough, on-screen indicator of
the potential for non-thermal effects. Changes have been ob￾served in vivo in mammalian tissue models for diagnostic US
exposures with an MI greater than ~0.4 in the presence of
UCAs. In addition, premature ventricular contractions have
been described when high MI end systolic triggering is used
in echocardiography [17, 18].
Users should balance the potential clinical benefit of the use of
UCAs against the theoretical possibility of associated adverse
bioeffects in humans.
Some general recommendations are:
▶ Resuscitation facilities should be available.
▶ Caution should be exercised for off-label use of UCA in tissues
in which damage to the microvasculature may have serious
clinical implications, such as in the eye, the brain and in the
neonate.
▶ As in all diagnostic US procedures, the operator should be
mindful of the desirability of keeping the displayed MI low
and of avoiding unduly long exposure times. Caution should
be exercised when using UCAs in patients with severe coron￾ary artery disease and pulmonary hypertension. Unstable
ischaemic heart disease in the 7 days prior to administration
is a relative contraindication. Caution with respect to the use
of UCAs in these cardiac instances derives from an anecdotal
temporal, but unproven causal, association between contrast
injection and death in severely compromised cardiac patients.
However, in very large patient cohorts, the use of UCAs for
acute cardiac patients has been shown to be associated with
a decreased, not increased risk of death, thanks to the efficacy
of the modality [19, 20].
7. Paediatrics
!
The current use of CEUS in paediatric work-up in Europe is
peculiar. Two UCAs are registered for clinical non-cardiac use,
Levovist® and SonoVue®. However only Levovist® is approved
for use in children and adolescents and only for the indication
of vesico-ureteral reflux study. At the same time production of
Levovist® has ceased and it is no longer available. SonoVue®,
performs equally well for this particular indication, but has to
be used off-label, as previously mentioned.

CEUS in paediatric applications remains of critical importance,
because of its obvious benefits compared to alternative ima￾ging modalities, which in most cases necessitate exposure to
ionizing radiation and the use of potentially harmful contrast
agents. The benefit of avoiding ionizing radiation is clearly far
more important in children and adolescents than in adult pa￾tients. This important question was addressed recently in a Let￾ter to the Editor of Ultraschall in der Medizin/European Journal
of Ultrasound, with a reply from the EFSUMB Executive Board
[5]. There is no easy solution to this problem as strict rules and
regulations apply to the official registration of medical drugs,
which is of course for the safety of patients and thus to the
benefit of all, including the medical community and pharma￾ceutical producers. In some situations, however, strict regula￾tions may inhibit use of the most beneficial and simple techni￾ques or drugs, and CEUS is one such example.
8. Pancreas
!
8.1 Background
CEUS is not indicated for the detection of focal solid or liquid
pancreatic lesions, but can be utilised for the characterisation
of sonographically detected lesions [21–23]. The use of CEUS
improves the diagnostic accuracy of US in the study of pan￾creatic pathologies.
8.2 Study Procedure
CEUS is an accurate imaging method, superior to Doppler
techniques, for the visualisation of intrapancreatic vessels and
microvessels [24]. Enhancement of the pancreas begins imme￾diately after aortic enhancement. After this early arterial phase
(10 to 30 sec), there is a transient venous phase (30 to ap￾proximately 120 sec), as with other dynamic imaging modal￾ities [4].
The CEUS study of a pancreatic mass should aim at its charac￾terisation and the evaluation of its relationship with the peri￾pancreatic arteries and veins [21, 22, 25, 26]. After completion
of the pancreatic study, the liver should be assessed in the late
phase, exploiting the same contrast injection, searching for
metastases [22].
8.3 Pancreatic Masses
8.3.1 Image interpretation for lesion characterisation
The enhancement pattern of focal pancreatic lesions is usually
compared with the adjacent pancreatic tissue. Therefore, the
field of view should include the mass under investigation to￾gether with a portion of surrounding pancreatic parenchyma.
8.3.2 Adenocarcinoma
Ductal adenocarcinoma, the most common primary malignan￾cy of the pancreas, is typically hypoenhancing in all phases,
presumably because of the desmoplastic reaction and low
mean vascular density [27–29]. This pattern is reported in
about 90% of cases [23, 27, 30]. Lesion size and margins as
well as the relationship with peripancreatic vessels are better
visualised with CEUS than with conventional US [25, 26].
CEUS can demonstrate changes in pancreatic tumour vascular￾isation during chemotherapy [31, 32] raising a hope for future
use in clinical practice.
8.3.3 Neuroendocrine tumours
Neuroendocrine tumours typically present as hyperenhanced
masses in the arterial phase, owing to their abundant arterial
vascularisation, even when the Doppler study is negative [21,
33, 34]. In larger tumours necrotic avascular areas result in in￾homogeneous enhancement [33, 34].
8.3.4 Mucin-producing cystic tumours
CEUS improves the ultrasonographic differential diagnosis be￾tween pseudocysts and cystic tumours of the pancreas by ac￾curately revealing vascularisation of intralesional septa or no￾dules [22].
Mucinous cystadenoma is a potentially malignant lesion that
may transform into cystadenocarcinoma. Usually unilocular, it
appears as a round macrocystic lesion, with particulate con￾tent, irregular thick walls and internal inclusions which en￾hance on CEUS [30, 35]. In general, mucinous cystic pancreatic
tumours have vascularised septa and parietal nodules [22, 35].
Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN) are divided
into main-duct and side branch-duct types. CEUS is helpful
for differentiating between perfused (nodules) and non-per￾fused (clot) regions [36]. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
and endoscopic US (EUS) are the imaging methods of choice
for the study of this tumour to demonstrate the communica￾tion of the cystic lesion with the pancreatic ducts [37, 38].
CEUS can be employed in the follow-up of borderline cystic
lesions of the pancreas, if well visualised on US, in order to
reduce the use of MRI.
8.3.5 Serous cystadenoma
Serous cystadenoma is a benign cystic lesion, typically with a
lobulated microcystic appearance with thin and centrally ori￾ented septa, which are vascularized on CEUS [22]. When the
cysts are minute, microcystic serous cystadenoma may mimic
a solid lesion, both on conventional US and CEUS. They are hy￾perenhanced on CEUS [38].
8.3.6 Pseudocysts
Pseudocysts typically contain non-vascularised material (deb￾ris), with the exception of transversing vessels, which are typi￾cally found in the early stages. Pseudocysts do not show any
signal on CEUS and remain completely non-enhancing in all
phases, even when they are heterogeneous on US [30, 35].
The reported sensitivity and specificity of CEUS in characteris￾ing pseudocysts is up to 100% [35].
8.4 Pancreatitis
In severe acute pancreatitis, CEUS may help identify and de￾lineate necrotic areas, which do not enhance [39]. If the pan￾creatic region is clearly visible on US, CEUS can be used in the
follow-up of acute pancreatitis after CT staging, in order to re￾duce the number of CT examinations [39].
Focal mass-forming pancreatitis and autoimmune pancreatitis
have been reported to have similar enhancement to that of
the normal pancreatic parenchyma [27].
8.5 Recommended uses and indications
Focal pancreatic lesions identified with US can be studied with
CEUS in order to improve:
1. Characterisation of ductal adenocarcinoma. (Recommenda￾tion Level: A;1b)
Piscaglia F et al. The EFSUMB Guidelines… Ultraschall in Med 2012; 33: 33–59
38 Guidelines
Downloaded by: NYU. Copyrighted material.

2. Differential diagnosis between pseudocysts and cystic tu￾mours. (Recommendation Level: A;1b)
3. Differentiation of vascular (solid) from avascular (liquid/ne￾crotic) components of a lesion. (Recommendation Level: A;1b)
4. Defining the dimensions and margins of a lesion, including its
relationship with adjacent vessels. (Recommendation Level:
B;2b)
5. Management of the lesion with a better distinction between
solid and cystic lesions, thus providing information for the
choice of the next imaging modality (i. e. MRI and/or Endo￾scopic US for cystic lesions). (Recommendation Level: C;5)
6. Diagnosis in cases that are indeterminate on CT (vascularisa￾tion of solid pancreatic lesions; differential diagnosis between
pseudocysts and pancreatic cystic tumours, especially muci￾nous cystic tumour). (Recommendation Level: C;5).
9. Contrast Enhanced Endoscopic US (CE-EUS)
!
9.1. Background
Contrast enhanced endoscopic ultrasound (CE-EUS) is a newly
established method which combines the advantage of high re￾solution US of internal organs with the administration of UCAs
[38]. CE endoscopic Doppler US works at high MI that does not
require specific software and uses the UCA as a Doppler en￾hancing medium [40, 41]. Low MI CE-EUS has been introduced
recently using the same contrast-specific modes as for trans￾abdominal CEUS [42–44].
EUS will be performed first and CE-EUS can be added to char￾acterise internal vasculature, to differentiate benign from ma￾lignant masses, and to improve staging and real-time guidance
of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.
9.2. Study procedures
9.2.1. Contrast enhanced high mechanical index EUS
In CE endoscopic Doppler US the colour Doppler window
should include the whole tumour if possible. The Doppler fre￾quency should be as high as possible, depending on the dis￾tance to the tumour. The Doppler scale should be between 3
and 8 cm/s assuming an insonation angle of 0° if directional
colour Doppler is used [45]. The gain should be as high as
possible without inducing artefacts. The flow velocity range
(pulse repetition frequency, PRF) should be 5 – 15 cm/s if
pulsed wave Doppler is used. The technique is the same as
for transcutaneous US. CE endoscopic Doppler US scanning
takes an extra 3 – 4 min [46].
9.2.2. Contrast enhanced low mechanical index EUS
(low MI CE-EUS)
The technique is the same as described for the transcutaneous
route. However, there are various settings that should be
checked in accordance with the manufacturer. The MI used in
published feasibility articles was variable [42, 43, 47], ranging
from 0.08 to 0.3.
9.3. Image interpretation for pancreatic lesions
9.3.1 Discrimination of adenocarcinoma
CE endoscopic Doppler US can be used to differentiate be￾tween pancreatic neoplasms, mainly the hypoenhancing ductal
adenocarcinoma and the iso- or hyperenhancing neuroendo￾crine tumours but also pseudo-solid lesions like serous micro￾cystic cystadenoma [21, 37, 48]. The differential diagnosis
between ductal adenocarcinoma and mass-forming focal pan￾creatitis can be improved since adenocarcinomas mainly contain
arterioles and hardly any venules whereas in focal pancreatitis
both arterioles and venules are detectable during CE endoscopic
Doppler US [45, 49–51]. The method can be improved further
by estimation of the resistance index (RI) of the arterioles. The
cut-off RI for suspected malignant lesions is > 0.70 versus < 0.70
for non-malignant, inflammatory lesions [52]. As for all other
US applications, the limitations of CE endoscopic Doppler US
are extensive calcifications and poor B-mode depiction of the
lesion.
Low MI CE-EUS seems to be more powerful, but there is cur￾rently only minimal published data [53–55]. Analysis of the
microvessel architecture seems to be an advantage over trans￾cutaneous CEUS, e. g., the central feeding artery in serous cy￾stadenoma [21]. The technique can be used in cases in which
significant artefacts impede transcutaneous visualisation, espe￾cially for characterisation and follow-up of focal pancreatic le￾sions. The accuracy for the differential diagnosis of pancreatic
adenocarcinoma is reported to be over 85% [53, 55, 56].
9.3.2 Discrimination of pancreatic pseudocysts from cystic
tumours
Low MI CE-EUS can be also used for differential diagnosis in
cystic pancreatic lesions [57] as described in the transcuta￾neous section. EUS has a clear advantage in small cystic
lesions and in patients with impaired transcutaneous visibility.
9.4 Differential diagnosis of autoimmune pancreatitis
Both focal and diffuse autoimmune pancreatitis show hyperen￾hancement. Low MI CE-EUS is able to visualise hyperenhance￾ment to discriminate ductal adenocarcinoma (which does not
hyperenhance) from autoimmune pancreatitis [58] but experi￾ence is limited. 3D reconstruction might have a higher impact
because of better visualisation of vessel patterns [58].
Recommended uses and indications
CE-EUS can be recommended for:
1. Discrimination of hypoenhancing ductal adenocarcinoma of
the pancreas from other iso- or hyperenhancing lesions. Ex￾perience is mainly based on CE endoscopic Doppler US. (Re￾commendation Level: A;1b)
2. Discrimination of mass-forming chronic pancreatitis from
ductal adenocarcinoma in patients with chronic pancreatitis.
(Recommendation Level: A;1a)
3. Improved discrimination of cystic tumours from pancreatic
pseudocysts. (Recommendation Level: A;1b)
10. Gastrointestinal Tract
!
10.1 Background
When examining the intestines, it is preferable to use frequen￾cies above 7.5 MHz to enable optimal visualisation of wall lay￾ers, thickened bowel walls and lesions. Higher contrast doses
(e. g. 2.4 – 4.8 ml SonoVue®) should be used. The arrival time
in the intestinal capillaries is usually 10 – 20 sec after injection,
particularly in the submucosal layer [59]. Peak enhancement is
reached after 30 – 40 sec and this arterial phase is followed by
a venous phase that lasts from 30 to approximately 120 sec.

Guidelines 39

10.2 Study procedure
Before i. v. UCA administration, the intestines must be exam￾ined in B-mode and Doppler US to detect any pathology. The
difference in bowel wall microvascularity between healthy and
diseased intestines can be recognised by CEUS [60].
10.3 Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)
10.3.1 Image interpretation and evaluation
CEUS allows the quantification of bowel wall vascularity in pa￾tients with Crohn’s disease [61] and correlates well with MRI
of the intestinal wall [62, 63]. Additionally, CEUS visualises
the microvascularity of the tissue surrounding the intestines.
Time Intensity Curve (TIC) analysis may further help to quan￾tify disease activity.
10.3.2 Disease activity
US can be used to study disease activity in IBD using bowel
wall thickness and Doppler measurements as a marker of in￾flammation [64–66]. Adding a UCA improves reliability in es￾timating disease activity in Crohn’s disease [67, 68]. Enhance￾ment in different wall layers can be evaluated and quantified
in Crohn’s disease and correlates to clinical activity indices
with good sensitivity and specificity [69–71]. Quantitative
measurements of bowel enhancement obtained by CEUS also
correlate with endoscopic severity [72] and histopathologic
findings [71]. Furthermore, ultrasonographic evaluation of the
changes of bowel wall enhancement during biological therapy
(e. g. antiTNF agents) promises to be a useful and relatively
cheap imaging modality for the clinical monitoring of the ac￾tivity of Crohn’s disease [73].
10.3.3 Distinguishing between fibrous and inflammatory
strictures
Preliminary studies indicate that the use of UCAs is effective
for the recognition of predominantly cicatricial stenoses in pa￾tients with Crohn’s disease [74]. In patients with bowel stric￾ture and resultant obstruction, it is important to determine
whether there is active inflammation at the site of stricture
or if the stenotic segment is fibrotic. Using CEUS, the active in￾flammatory components enhance strongly whereas a fibrotic
stricture enhances poorly [75].
10.3.4 Abscesses
Distinguishing abscesses from inflammatory infiltrates is an
important clinical task in the management of Crohn’s disease.
If areas of a significant size close to or within an affected
bowel wall are completely devoid of microbubble signals, these
lesions likely represent abscesses rather than inflammatory in￾filtrates, particularly if adjacent tissue shows hyperenhance￾ment [61]. Similar findings also apply to abscesses caused by
other diseases, e. g. diverticulitis [76].
10.3.5 Fistula
Injecting a UCA into one of the orifices of a fistula improves
visualisation of the course of the fistula in Crohn’s disease
[77]. The UCA can be diluted manyfold with sterile saline be￾fore injection into orifices (see section on intracavitary appli￾cations).
10.4 Limitations
It is impossible to visualise all bowel segments using transab￾dominal US. Intestinal peristalsis can impair image quality and
the repeatability of quantitative measurement of bowel en￾hancement patterns. More studies are needed to establish the
exact role of CEUS in the imaging of GI pathology [78].
Recommended uses and indications
CEUS is indicated in the following clinical situations:
1. Estimation of disease activity in inflammatory bowel disease.
(Recommendation Level: B;1b)
2. Discerning between fibrous and inflammatory strictures in
Crohn’s disease. (Recommendation Level: C;4)
3. Characterisation of suspected abscesses. (Recommendation
Level: C;4)
4. Confirming and following the route of fistulas. (Recommenda￾tion Level: C;4)
11 Spleen
!
11.1 Background
The indication for CEUS investigation of the spleen, other than
in trauma (see section 15), is the characterisation of focal le￾sions [79]. Solid splenic lesions may be occasional incidental
US findings in asymptomatic subjects. In this setting and
when they are single or scanty, especially if they are hyper￾echoic on conventional US, they are benign in the large major￾ity of cases. However, in cancer patients, especially when le￾sions are multiple, hypoechoic and of recent onset, they tend
to be malignant. Unfortunately, the clinical information and
US findings are not usually sufficient to provide a reliable dis￾tinction between benign and malignant masses. Fine needle
biopsy of splenic masses may have complications, especially
peritoneal bleeding, making a noninvasive diagnosis highly de￾sirable. CEUS may increase confidence in suggesting a benign
nature.
11.2 Study procedure
The peculiar splenic vascularisation [80] leads to a rapid and
transiently inhomogeneous enhancement pattern, especially
in congestive splenomegaly, resembling the “zebra” pattern
seen on dynamic CECT or CEMRI. About 1 minute after injec￾tion, the parenchyma becomes homogeneous, showing strong
and persistent late phase enhancement that lasts longer than
5 minutes [81].
11.3 Image interpretation
CEUS is useful for characterising ectopic splenic tissue (acces￾sory spleens and post-splenectomy splenosis) [82]. Splenic hi￾lar lymph nodes, adrenal lesions, pancreatic tail tumours, me￾tastatic deposits, and other lesions show less enhancement
than the normal splenic parenchyma in the late phase. Acces￾sory spleens usually exhibit a typical location and appearance
and further imaging is necessary only in a minority of cases.
CEUS shows an enhancement pattern exactly paralleling that
of the adjacent spleen [83], i. e. more intense than that of
other organs in the late phase.
In splenic infarction, CEUS accurately demonstrates the shape
and extent of the lesion as a wedge-shaped, non-enhancing
area based on the spleen capsule and pointing towards the
hilum [84].
A splenic abscess is a poorly- or completely non-enhancing le￾sion, best recognised in venous phase images, with an enhanc￾ing rim and septa. No contrast enhancement is seen within
Piscaglia F et al. The EFSUMB Guidelines… Ultraschall in Med 2012; 33: 33–59
40 Guidelines

the internal fluid, debris, or necrotic components. Intermediate
and early stage lesions show mixed patterns, like those in the
liver [85].
Typical findings for benign splenic lesions include either no
contrast enhancement or rapid wash-in, followed by persistent
enhancement in the late phase. If CEUS findings are consistent
with a benign splenic lesion, CT seems to be of limited addi￾tional value [86]. In contrast, the combination of contrast en￾hancement (diffuse or peripheral) in the arterial phase fol￾lowed by rapid and marked wash-out is typical for malignant
lesions (metastases or lymphoma) [87–90]. However, the be￾haviour of malignant and some benign lesions partially over￾lap, since haemangiomas, hamartomas, as well as other un￾common splenic abnormalities, may show some degree of
wash-out, mimicking a malignant pattern [90, 91].
11.4 Differential diagnosis and limitations
In patients with left upper quadrant pain and splenic inhomo￾geneity on conventional US, CEUS allows visualisation of the
underlying splenic abnormalities [84] increasing operator con￾fidence in establishing a diagnosis [92]. CEUS is particularly
helpful when an infarcted region is barely recognisable on US
or it is spherical and simulates a focal lesion. Additionally,
CEUS can diagnose splenic tumour infiltration mimicking in￾farction on conventional US. Differentiating splenic abscesses
from necrotic lymphomatous lesions remains a challenge,
since both conditions may occur in the immunocompromised
patient.
CEUS may be helpful when a splenic cyst with ill-defined mar￾gins and/or inhomogeneous content is identified with US.
Echogenic splenic tumours incidentally found on US and asses￾sed by CEUS can be diagnosed as haemangiomas and can be
managed with follow-up examinations.
11.5 Splenic tumour detection
CEUS may aid in detecting focal lesions in the spleen [79]. Le￾sions that are not seen on baseline US can be revealed by
CEUS, which has been found to be 90% sensitive and 100%
specific compared to CT with respect to lesion detection in
lymphoma patients [93]. In a retrospective study on splenic
metastases, CEUS increased the detection rate by 38% [94]. Le￾sions found in patients with solid organ or haematological ma￾lignancies require whole-body imaging using CT and/or PET
[95], but CEUS can be useful if they are inconclusive, parti￾cularly to rule out lesions when PET shows “non-specific
uptake”. Finally, CEUS can be used in patients with splenic
malignancies to monitor their response to treatment. When
chemotherapy is successful, the lesion becomes almost non￾enhancing on CEUS with absence of any intra-nodular vessels
or microcirculation. These findings are seen early, paralleling
the PET response. Long-term follow-up shows progressive dis￾appearance of the lesions.
Recommended uses and indications
CEUS can be utilised:
1. To characterise splenic parenchymal inhomogeneity or sus￾pected lesions on conventional US. (Recommendation Level:
B;1b)
2. To confirm suspected splenic infarction. (Recommendation
Level: B;2b)
3. To characterize suspected accessory spleens or splenosis.
(Recommendation Level: B;2b)
4. To detect splenic malignant lesions in oncologic patients when
CT and/or MRI and PET are contraindicated or inconclusive.
(Recommendation Level: B;1b)
12. Kidney
!
12.1 Background and vascular anatomy
In most centres, ultrasonography is the preferred first imaging
modality in patients with known or suspected renal disease.
The main objectives are to measure renal size, to detect focal
lesions and obstruction of the collecting system and to look
for vascular disorders. However, US is not reliable in distin￾guishing between different types of tissue and benign and ma￾lignant lesions may be difficult to distinguish. Doppler helps to
characterise renal blood flow, with limitations because of at￾tenuation, poor sensitivity for very slow blood flow, and angle
dependency.
12.2 Study procedure
Kidneys enhance quickly and intensively after microbubble ad￾ministration. The arterial pedicle and main branches enhance
first, followed within a few seconds by complete fill-in of the
cortex. Unlike with Doppler US, signals from microbubbles are
independent of the angle of insonation, and depiction of renal
perfusion is excellent even at the renal poles. Medullary perfu￾sion follows cortical perfusion, with the outer medulla enhan￾cing first, followed by gradual fill-in of the pyramids [96].
There is no microbubble excretion into the urinary tract. As
contrast concentration in the general circulation decreases, en￾hancement fades. The expert opinion is that contrast enhance￾ment is less intense and fades earlier in patients with chronic
renal disease.
12.3 Renal ischaemia
Several investigations, both in animal studies and in humans,
have shown excellent diagnostic performance in the detection
of renal parenchymal ischaemia, similar to that of CECT [97]
and superior to colour Doppler US, making CEUS a recommen￾ded technique in case of suspicion of infarction. Infarcts ap￾pear as wedge-shaped non-enhancing areas within an other￾wise enhanced kidney. The excellent spatial resolution of
CEUS allows confident differentiation between renal infarction
and cortical necrosis, which appears as non-enhancing cortical
areas with preserved hilar vascularity [96, 98].
Another important application of CEUS in patients with renal
ischaemia is differentiation between non-perfused, infarcted
tissue and hypoperfused parenchymal regions. On Doppler
US, both appear as areas lacking colour signal, but only infarc￾ted areas completely lack contrast enhancement after micro￾bubble injection.
12.4 Renal artery stenosis
UCAs can be injected to improve the sensitivity of convention￾al colour Doppler US in identifying the renal arteries, with an
improvement of approximately 10% [99]. This allows correct
positioning of the sample volume for the detection of Doppler
spectral tracings with the aim of screening for renal artery
stenosis. Routine use of UCA offers no significant advantage
[99].

12.5 Renal focal lesions
12.5.1 Differential diagnosis between cystic and solid lesions
Thanks to its excellent sensitivity, CEUS is more sensitive than
CECT in detecting blood flow in hypovascularized lesions [100]
and can be utilised in the few cases in which the distinction
between solid hypovascular tumours (showing enhancement,
even if there is very little flow) and atypical cystic masses
(no contrast perfusion at all) remains unresolved after CT and
colour Doppler US.
12.5.2 Differential diagnosis between solid renal masses and
pseudotumours
The enhancement in renal tumours differs from the surround￾ing parenchyma, with a difference in degree or distribution of
enhancement in at least one vascular phase, in the majority of
cases. This helps differentiation between tumours and pseudo￾tumours, since the latter have the same enhancing characteris￾tics as the surrounding parenchyma in all phases [96, 101]. So￾lid renal tumours do not show diagnostic perfusion patterns
on CEUS, which is thus usually not able to differentiate be￾tween malignant and benign solid renal masses (e. g. carcino￾ma versus angiomyolipoma).
In expert hands, CEUS may help identify renal vein invasion by
cancers with an accuracy comparable to CECT [102]. In addi￾tion, in the opinion of the experts, the arterial vascularisation
of the thrombus in the renal vein promises to differentiate
bland thrombus (non-enhancing) from tumour invasion (en￾hancing thrombus), but further studies are necessary.
12.5.3 Characterisation of complex cystic renal masses
CEUS allows the characterisation of renal cystic lesions as be￾nign or malignant with at least the same accuracy as CECT. It
is more sensitive than CT in detecting enhancement of the
cystic wall, septa, and solid components [103–106]. Nonethe￾less, CT remains the reference method for staging patients
with malignant cystic lesions. CEUS is very well suited for the
follow-up of non-surgical lesions and might replace CT, in light
of its lack of contraindications, wide availability and lack of
ionizing radiation, all of which are particularly welcome in
this setting.
12.5.4 Renal infections
Following the European Urology Association guidelines, diag￾nosis of acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis is based on the
clinical picture and laboratory findings. Conventional B-mode
US is used to rule out urinary obstruction and renal stones.
Additional investigations should be considered if the patient
remains febrile after 72 h of treatment. These recommenda￾tions have a low level of evidence, and are made despite the
absence of directly applicable clinical studies of good quality.
As a consequence, the role of CEUS and of imaging itself in pa￾tients with uncomplicated pyelonephritis is debated and no
clear indications exist, despite the finding that CEUS depicts
renal abscesses as non-enhancing regions and can be used to
monitor their course [96].
12.6 Assessment of percutaneous ablation therapies
Percutaneous ablation plays an increasing role in the manage￾ment of patients with renal tumours. Diagnostic imaging in
these patients includes CECT and/or CEMRI imaging during
pre-treatment work-up and at distinct time points during fol￾low-up after treatment. Unenhanced US can be used to guide
ablation, but does not provide enough information about the
outcome of ablation treatments. There is increasing evidence
that, CEUS overcomes many of these limitations in patients
undergoing renal tumour ablation [107]. It provides important
information on lesion vascularity, and may improve visualisa￾tion of lesions that are poorly demonstrated on the baseline
US scan. Guidance of the ablation needle into the lesion and
assessment of the therapeutic results are improved [108,
109]. Similarly to the liver, the intra-procedural assessment
must be delayed by 5 – 10 minutes after the end of the abla￾tion to allow the heat-generated gas and the related artefacts
to dissipate. Any contrast enhancement within the ablation
zone is conventionally regarded as residual tumour. Larger
vessels surrounding the ablated region may be misinterpreted
as residual tumour. Meticulous comparison with pre-procedur￾al examinations and evaluation of lesion morphology are
therefore important to avoid misdiagnosis, since residual tu￾mour presents as nodular or crescent-like enhancing regions,
with enhancement remaining similar to what observed in the
tumour before treatment [110]. In two recent series of 28
[111] and 66 [110] renal tumours with sufficiently long fol￾low-up, CEUS provided similar overall accuracy to that of CT/
MRI in confirming the adequacy of treatment.
Recommended uses and indications
CEUS is recommended in the following clinical situations:
1. Suspected vascular disorders, including renal infarction and
cortical necrosis. (Recommendation Level: A;1a)
2. Differential diagnosis between solid lesions and cysts present￾ing with equivocal appearance at conventional US. (Recom￾mendation Level: B;2b)
3. Differentiation between renal tumours and anatomical varia￾tions mimicking a renal tumour (“pseudo-tumours”) when
conventional US is equivocal. (Recommendation Level: B;1b).
However, both CEUS and CECT have limitations in rare very
small isoenhancing tumours.
4. Characterisation of complex cystic masses as benign, indeter￾minate or malignant to provide information for the surgical
strategy. (Recommendation Level: A;1b)
5. Additional aid, when necessary, in the follow-up of non-surgi￾cal complex masses. (Recommendation Level: C;5).
6. Identification of clinically-suspected renal abscesses in pa￾tients with complicated urinary tract infection. (Recommen￾dation Level: C;5)
7. In patients undergoing renal tumour ablation under US guid￾ance, CEUS may be used to improve lesion visualisation in dif￾ficult cases and to detect residual tumour either immediately
or later after ablation. When CEUS is planned, pre-ablation as￾sessment of lesion vascularity is important. (Recommenda￾tion Level: B;1b)
13 Vesico-Ureteric Reflux (VUR)
!
13.1 Background
In addition to intravascular use, UCAs are suitable for intraca￾vitary administration. The intravesical administration of UCA
for the diagnosis of vesico-ureteric reflux, voiding urosonogra￾phy, has become a routine option that can completely replace
reflux examinations using ionizing radiation (i. e. voiding cy￾stourethrography) in girls. Comparative studies between void￾ing urosonography and cystourethrography have revealed sig￾Piscaglia F et al. The EFSUMB Guidelines… Ultraschall in Med 2012; 33: 33–59

nificantly higher sensitivity for urosonography in detecting re￾flux [112, 113].
Levovist® is licensed for VUR. SonoVue®, seems to perform at
least as well [114] although it is not licensed for this indica￾tion.
13.2 Study procedure
The basic steps of voiding urosonography [112] are:
(a) US evaluation of the kidneys and bladder;
(b) intravesical administration of UCA diluted in normal sterile
saline and
(c) repeated scanning of the bladder and kidneys at low MI
during and after bladder filling and, finally while voiding. Dur￾ing the last step, urethrosonography (transpubic and/or trans￾perineal) is added in some centres.
UCAs can be administered via a transurethral bladder catheter
or via suprapubic puncture (0.1 – 0.5 mL SonoVue® in 500 mL
0.9% saline [112, 115]), by slow instillation during CEUS mon￾itoring, until strong enhancement of the bladder content has
been achieved. The dose can be adjusted if there is excessive
shadowing or insufficient signal. A full bladder is necessary
for suprapubic puncture, and it is advisable to apply an anaes￾thetic plaster to the puncture site about one hour prior to the
examination.
13.3 Diagnosis of vesico-ureteral reflux
Reflux is diagnosed when microbubbles appear in one or both
ureters and/or the pelvicalyceal system. The severity of reflux
is graded using 5 degrees (grade I–V) [116] comparable to the
international reflux grading system of voiding cystourethro￾graphy. The US scan is continued during and after voiding
with the child supine, prone, sitting, or standing, always scan￾ning the kidneys alternately and also the bladder, if the pa￾tient’s position allows [112].
13.4 Voiding urosonography
Voiding urosonography is also helpful for studying the urethra
[117]. However, further studies on this application are needed.
Voiding urosonography can be considered the method of choice
for the initial study of suspected VUR in girls, in whom informa￾tion about the urethra is less important, whereas voiding cys￾tourethrography continues to be the first choice in boys, though
voiding urosonography also shows potential in this setting [117].
Conventional cystography remains the reference technique in pa￾tients with abnormal urethral findings and/or to plan surgery.
13.5. Limitations
Voiding urosonography is not recommended as the primary
imaging modality for reflux, if the bladder or one of the kid￾neys is not depicted on ultrasound and for specific urethral
and/or bladder functional and anatomical evaluation [113].
Recommended uses and indications
Voiding urosonography is recommended in the following clin￾ical situations:
1. First examination for vesicoureteral reflux in girls. (Recom￾mendation Level: A;1a)
2. Follow-up examinations for vesicoureteral reflux in girls and
boys after conservative or surgical therapy. (Recommendation
Level: A;1a)
3. Screening high-risk patients for reflux (e. g. siblings, trans￾planted kidney). (Recommendation Level: A;1a)
4. The CEUS assessment of urethra in boys appears feasible and
accurate, but not enough experience has been gained yet to
recommend it in routine clinical practice. (Recommendation
Level: 0;4)
14 Scrotum
!
14.1 Background
Ultrasonography is the imaging modality of choice for examina￾tion of the scrotum. Occasionally, however, sonographic findings
are equivocal and this may be important as a misinterpretation
can result in an unnecessary orchiectomy. A particular conun￾drum is the unequivocal differentiation between hypovascular
and avascular lesions, presuming that an avascular lesion im￾plies benign disease: this may be impossible using colour Dop￾pler US. CEUS provides a practical solution by increasing the
confidence of the interpretation of lesion vascularity and of
scrotal cord vessels, allowing for appropriate clinical manage￾ment.
14.2 Study procedure
A full B-mode and colour Doppler examination of the lesion
with linear high frequency transducers should be performed
and recorded to relate to the subsequent CEUS findings. The
arterial phase at CEUS is the most important aspect of the ex￾amination. The testis and epididymis enhance rapidly but the
arrival time varies between individuals. The arteries enhance
first, followed within seconds by complete parenchymal en￾hancement. The scrotal wall tends to enhance to a lesser de￾gree than the contents. There is no accumulation of microbub￾bles in the parenchyma of the testis and the enhancement
declines over a variable period of time such that there is mini￾mal residual enhancement by 3 minutes.
14.3 Patterns of disease
14.3.1 Torsion of the spermatic cord
CEUS may be used as a problem solving technique in children
with small testes where conventional Doppler imaging meth￾ods provide suboptimal assessment of flow. There is no firm
data currently to inform the use of CEUS in spermatic cord tor￾sion. In a small series of men with torsion, CEUS confirmed
absence of vascularisation, but failed to add any clinically sig￾nificant information to unenhanced colour Doppler US [118].
14.3.2 Segmental Infarction
The appearance of acute segmental testicular infarction on con￾ventional B-mode and colour Doppler US is variable. Often the
benign nature of the lesion is established by its wedge shape
with markedly diminished or absent colour Doppler flow [119].
The main concern is the differentiation of a segmental infarct
with a rounded configuration from a poorly vascularised tu￾mour [120]. CEUS improves the characterisation of segmental
infarction by showing one or more ischaemic parenchymal lo￾bules separated by normal testicular vessels [121]. Subacute
segmental infarction characteristically exhibits a perilesional
rim of enhancement, which diminishes over time and is even￾tually lost with changes in lesion shape and shrinkage [121].
14.3.3 Trauma
Conventional B-mode and colour Doppler assessment of the
testis in trauma is well established, but they under-estimate
Piscaglia F et al. The EFSUMB Guidelines… Ultraschall in Med 2012; 33: 33–59
Guidelines 43
Downloaded by: NYU. Copyrighted material.

the extent of injury. Besides integrity or interruption of the tu￾nica albuginea, the most important information for the sur￾geon is the extent of viable testicular tissue. CEUS adds to the
colour Doppler assessment with clear delineation of fracture
lines, intratesticular haematomas, and the amount of viable
testis [122].
14.3.4 Inflammation
Epididymo-orchitis is a clinical diagnosis and is usually easily
confirmed on colour Doppler US. CEUS may be able to deter￾mine the development of an abscess (appearing as a non-en￾hancing region) at an earlier stage, or the extent of a large ab￾scess, and allow for prompt treatment [118]. CEUS may be
utilised in selected cases to increase the sensitivity in detect￾ing thrombosis of the spermatic cord vessels, especially in fu￾niculitis, and in detecting post-inflammatory parenchymal
ischaemic changes.
14.3.5 Tumours and complex cysts
The current understanding is that testicular tumours with a dia￾meter of less than 1.5 cm may not show flow on colour Doppler
US and thus may be misinterpreted as a benign lesion, the pur￾ported hallmark of malignancy being an increase in vascularity.
Simple testicular cysts are usually benign, but any wall irregu￾larity or echogenic debris may be suggestive of a (rare) cystic
testicular tumour [123, 124]. It is thought that virtually all tes￾ticular tumours display vascularisation on CEUS, with the excep￾tion of any cystic component and regions of necrosis [125]. Ex￾perience suggests that CEUS is able to confirm the absence of
vascularity in benign complex and epidermoid cysts [126].
There is currently no evidence in the literature with regards to
these findings.
Recommended uses and indications
CEUS for the testis can be currently recommended for:
1. Discrimination of focal testicular lesions into those that are
vascular and those that show no enhancement, potentially
identifying lesions without malignant potential. (Recommen￾dation Level: B;2b)
2. Discrimination of areas of non-viable tissue in cases of testicu￾lar trauma. (Recommendation Level: B;4)
3. Detection and characterisation of segmental infarction. (Re￾commendation Level: B;2b)
4. Discrimination of abscess formation in severe epididymo-or￾chitis. (Recommendation Level: C;4)
15. Abdominal Trauma
!
15.1 Background
CECT is the modality of choice for the rapid detection and
grading of neurological, skeletal, and thoraco-abdominal inju￾ries in all cases of high-energy multitrauma. However, there
is a wide range of severity among trauma patients who are
admitted to an emergency unit, and the rate of positive find￾ings on CT decreases with lower energy trauma. This should
be weighed against the negative aspects of CT, including expo￾sure to ionizing radiation and injection of iodinated contrast
media. US is sensitive in detecting free peritoneal fluid as an
indirect sign of injury (Focused Assessment with Sonography
in Trauma – FAST) but it has poor sensitivity in detecting solid
organ trauma and is even less useful for hollow viscus trauma.
CEUS can increase the conspicuity of traumatic injuries, with a
closer correlation with CT [87, 127, 128]. In a large, multicen￾tre study [129], CEUS was more sensitive than US and pro￾vided sensitivities of 69% (renal), 84% (liver) and 93% (spleen)
compared to CT in the detection of solid organ injuries with
very high specificity (over 90%).
15.2. Study procedure
Contrast enhancement lasts long enough to allow an adequate
exploration of all parenchymal organs in the trauma patient.
The kidneys have the earliest and most transient enhancement
and the spleen is inhomogeneous initially and then becomes
persistently and homogeneously enhanced. Consequently the
examination sequence usually starts with the kidneys, then
moves to the liver, and finally examines the spleen. An alter￾native is to split the contrast dose in two, using the first to ex￾plore the right kidney and then the liver, and the second for
the left kidney and the spleen. However, in many instances
the CEUS study directly targets the organ suspected or known
to be injured.
15.3 Image interpretation of abdominal injuries
CEUS demonstrates the injuries as non-enhancing defects, shar￾ply demarcated from the intensely enhanced, undamaged tissue,
particularly during the venous phase. Contusion appears as an
ill-defined area of subtle hypoenhancement. Lacerations are de￾picted as markedly hypoechoic bands, usually oriented perpen￾dicular to the organ surface; sometimes the torn organ capsule
is seen as a discontinuity. A haematoma is recognisable as a
non-enhancing area without internal enhanced vessels. CEUS
can detect changes that are not apparent on conventional US,
such as infarcts, perilesional hyperaemia, pseudoaneurysm for￾mation, as well as contrast extravasation, which appears as a
pooling or as a jet of contrast enhancement outside blood ves￾sels. The spread of contrast enhanced blood into the parenchy￾ma, the peritoneal cavity, or the retroperitoneum is an impor￾tant finding since it indicates on-going haemorrhage and the
need for surgery. As shown both by experimental and clinical
studies, CEUS can detect ongoing bleeding from a variety of
traumatic and also non-traumatic sources [87].
Emergency CT scans of trauma patients can have artefacts and
CEUS may be useful for better assessing unclear findings. Fur￾thermore, CEUS may be used in patients not ideal for CECT,
such as children (see section 7). CEUS may decrease the num￾ber of repeat US examinations and expedite patient discharge.
Several published series have demonstrated that CEUS allows a
confident exclusion of major abdominal injuries. Hence, many
patients with minor trauma can be discharged after a period
of observation, without being submitted to CT at all.
15.4 Limitations
Since UCAs are not excreted in the urine, CEUS cannot be used
for detecting damage to the urinary excretory system.
Recommended uses and indications
CEUS can be employed consistently in trauma imaging, consid￾ering the wide spectrum of scenarios encountered in clinical
practice.
1. As an alternative to CT in stable patients with isolated blunt
moderate-energy abdominal trauma to rule out solid organ
injuries, especially in children (Recommendation Level: A;1b)
Piscaglia F et al. The EFSUMB Guidelines… Ultraschall in Med 2012; 33: 33–59
44 Guidelines
Downloaded by: NYU. Copyrighted material.

2. To further evaluate uncertain CT findings (Recommendation
Level: C;2b)
3. For the follow-up of trauma managed conservatively, because
it may make it possible to reduce in the number of CT scans
or increase confidence when the situation does not strictly
require a CT scan. (Recommendation Level: B;1b)
16. Lung and Pleural Lesions
!
16.1 Background
US imaging of the healthy lung is impossible because the US
beam is totally reflected at the lung surface. Consolidations
can be visualised when they reach the pleura, are accessible
via an acoustic window, and there is no subcutaneous emphy￾sema or pneumothorax [130]. CEUS assessment of the lung is
therefore addressed to lung consolidations.
Because of its dual arterial supply, the lung has similarities to
the liver and CEUS allows the differentiation of the pulmonary
from the systemic bronchial arterial supply of consolidations
by assessing the timing and extent of enhancement [131].
16.2 Study procedure
For lung consolidation, a conventional convex abdominal
transducer is most commonly used. Before injecting the UCA,
the best probe position to visualise the consolidation should
be determined using B-mode and colour Doppler US and then
observed for at least the first 30 s after contrast administration
[132].
16.3 Image interpretation
Contrast arrives in the right heart between 1 and 5 sec after
injection and immediately thereafter enters the pulmonary ar￾tery (indicating the beginning of the time window of pulmon￾ary arterial enhancement), and between 8 and 11 sec enters
the left heart (determining the start of systemic bronchial ar￾terial enhancement immediately thereafter) in healthy sub￾jects. An arrival time in the consolidation under study of less
than 10 seconds (“early arterial enhancement”) indicates pul￾monary arterial supply and a delayed arrival time over 10 sec￾onds (“late arterial enhancement”) indicates supply by the
bronchial arteries. In patients with cardiac and/or pulmonary
disease, the arrival time for pulmonary arterial supply may be
longer than 10 seconds [131].
16.3.1 Pneumonia
Contrast arrives early in pneumonia (10 sec) and enhancement
is marked [131] followed by a plateau caused by a combined
supply from pulmonary and bronchial arteries [132]. In addi￾tion, CEUS allows demarcation of necrosis or abscess forma￾tions in the infiltrated lung tissue as regions of absent en￾hancement [131].
16.3.2 Pulmonary embolism
In embolic pulmonary infarcts, the arrival time is delayed and
the degree of enhancement is minimal [131] within the first
30 seconds after UCA administration [132]. Such a decrease
in enhancement is most evident early after pulmonary embo￾lism and progressively recovers, so that infarctions are more
clearly recognisable early after their onset. Quantification of
contrast enhancement using dedicated software may provide
more consistent information. Pleurisy or pneumonia can be
clearly differentiated from pulmonary embolism by early and
intense pulmonary artery enhancement [131–133].
16.3.3 Pulmonary carcinoma and metastasis
The value of CEUS for lung cancer is the improved delineation
of viable from non-viable tissue before biopsy compared to
colour Doppler US [134]. Lung tumours may behave very vari￾ably as regards contrast distribution on CEUS, but on average
the time of arrival is late arterial as the arterial supply is
from the bronchial system and not from pulmonary arteries
[131, 132].
16.3.4 Atelectasis
In atelectasis, the CEUS pattern is similar to pneumonia with
early and marked enhancement (< 10 sec) followed by a pla￾teau [132]. An underlying central tumour may be better differ￾entiated from the atelectasis by late enhancement [134].
Recommended uses and applications (applicable only to
peripheral lesions visible on US)
1. CEUS is useful in differentiating inflammatory from embolic
lung consolidation, especially in patients with equivocal CT
findings. (Recommendation Level B;2b)
2. CEUS may be used in equivocal cases to diagnose lung absces￾ses within pneumonia, since CEUS appears better than con￾ventional B-mode US or X-ray. (Recommendation Level C;5)
17. Vascular
!
17.1 Background
There are two major extracerebral vascular systems with com￾mon indications for CEUS. One is the cervical carotid artery
and the other the abdominal aorta. Conventional US techni￾ques are limited in demonstrating slow flow, especially in
small vessels such as vasa vasorum or collaterals and flow in
critical stenoses. UCAs help to overcome some of these limita￾tions and might be used also in other extracerebral vascular
districts, but such usage is less well established and is not re￾ported herein.
17.2 Study Procedures
As for conventional investigations, CEUS of the carotid artery
is carried out with linear probes working in the range of
5 – 10 MHz and the abdominal aorta with convex probes at
2.5 – 5 MHz.
17.3 Carotid artery
17.3.1 Stenosis
Duplex US is the first line imaging modality for suspected car￾otid artery disease [135–138]. CEUS improves the sensitivity
of Doppler US and can be used for distinguishing occlusion
from tight sub-occlusive stenosis, even with conventional US
equipment. However, when a contrast-specific modality is
available, low MI CEUS can be utilised to further improve the
delineation of the endovascular border in difficult cases, mak￾ing it possible to detect the shape of pre-stenotic, intra-steno￾tic and post-stenotic segments, especially in elongated vessels
[139, 140]. This is also facilitated by the fact that high velocity
and low-velocity flow phenomena are registered at the same
time with CEUS without aliasing and blooming artefacts and
without any angle dependence, which all affect Doppler US
Piscaglia F et al. The EFSUMB Guidelines… Ultraschall in Med 2012; 33: 33–59
Guidelines 45
Downloaded by: NYU. Copyrighted material.

[139, 140]. However, CEUS does not provide flow information,
which may still be obtained by Doppler US, potentially facili￾tated by contrast injection. Plaque ulceration can be imaged
using CEUS [141].
17.3.2 Follow-up after carotid stenting
CEUS is a reliable method for evaluating re-stenosis after inter￾nal carotid artery stenting [142]. CEUS has fewer intrastenotic
flow artefacts compared to colour and power Doppler US, re￾sulting in better visualisation and detection of the complete
length and morphology of the stenosis [142].
17.3.3 Dissection
The pathognomonic imaging findings are mural haematomas
and the depiction of a true and false lumen and small flaps.
Blood flow is usually decreased in the false lumen [143], in￾creasing the risk of thrombosis, eventually resulting in com￾plete occlusion or emboli [144]. MRI is the reference standard
in the diagnosis of cervical vessel dissections; when it is con￾traindicated, the diagnostic accuracy of US examinations can
be improved by the use of CEUS [139, 140].
17.3.4 Complications after vascular intervention
Due to aliasing artefacts, correct visualisation of post-surgical
fistula tracks can be difficult using conventional colour Dop￾pler US. However, with CEUS, fistula tracks can be detected
without aliasing or overwriting artefacts [145]. Additionally,
CEUS may help to image flow in false aneurysms with greater
precision than colour Doppler US.
17.3.5 Plaque characterisation
The most widely accepted predictor of stroke risk is the degree
of carotid stenosis. However, other imaging features are becom￾ing recognised as significant factors [146]. Plaque neovasculari￾sation demonstrated by CEUS correlates well with histological
findings [147, 148] and is a potential additional predictor of cer￾ebral ischaemic events, best assessed by quantification software
[141, 147–150], but any role in daily clinical practice is still to
be demonstrated.
17.4 Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)
CEUS can overcome some limitations of conventional US by im￾proving the delineation of the aortic lumen and the detection of
the main branching arteries. CEUS also improves the diagnosis
of aortic rupture by detecting contrast extravasation [151].
17.4.1 Aortic dissections
Usually dissection of the abdominal aorta is an extension of
thoracic aortic dissection [151]. Up to 38% of aortic dissections
are missed on initial imaging examination and up to 28% of
aortic dissections remain undetected until autopsy [152–
155]. In most cases, the true and false lumen can be discrimi￾nated with CEUS, because both early (true lumen) and late
(false lumen) contrast enhancement can be detected, provided
the false lumen is not thrombosed [153, 155]. Vascular compli￾cations such as renal or splenic infarction can be evaluated
[139].
17.4.2 Inflammatory Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm
Inflammatory aneurysm of the abdominal aorta is a variant of
atherosclerotic aneurysm that is characterized by inflamma￾tory and/or fibrotic changes in the periaortic regions of the
retroperitoneum [156, 157]. The triad of a thickened aneurys￾mal wall, extensive perianeurysmal and retroperitoneal fibro￾sis, with adhesions to adjacent abdominal organs, should sug￾gest this diagnosis [158–160]. Contrast enhancement in the
inflammatory aneurysm improves differentiation between cov￾ered aortic rupture and inflammatory aneurysm [161].
17.4.3 Endoleaks
Early and midterm results of endovascular repair of AAA are
promising but long-term durability and outcomes of this tech￾nique are still unclear. Endoleaks represent blood flow outside
the stent graft lumen but within the aneurysm sac and are
conventionally detected by CT angiography, which however,
does not allow detection of some types of endoleak [162]. Sev￾eral authors have pointed out the usefulness of CEUS because
it seems to identify and characterise endoleaks better than CT
angiography, with analysis of velocity and flow direction
[163–169]. CEUS enhancement quantification by TIC provides
additional accuracy [168]. Once an aortic endoleak has been
detected, CEUS can be used for the follow-up of patients [170].
17.5 Limitations
Limitations in the CEUS exploration of the carotid artery and
abdominal aorta are any conditions which prevent adequate
US penetration and which also limit conventional B-mode US
exploration. Of particular regard are extensive wall calcifica￾tion and subcutaneous emphysema after intervention or lim￾ited examination windows.
Recommended uses and indications
CEUS is recommended for the following indications:
1. Differentiation between total carotid occlusion and residual
flow in tight stenoses by contrast enhanced Doppler or CEUS.
(Recommendation Level: B;3)
2. Improvement of lumen delineation in technically difficult car￾otid arteries (contrast enhanced Doppler US can also provide
useful information). (Recommendation Level: B;3)
3. Evaluation of carotid plaque neovascularisation. (Recommen￾dation Level: B;1b)
4. Improving the detection of dissection of the common and in￾ternal carotid arteries, vertebral artery and aorta. (Recom￾mendation Level: C;3)
5. Detection of aortic wall rupture. (Recommendation Level: B;3)
6. As an additional tool in the characterisation of suspected in￾flammatory AAA. (Recommendation Level: C;5)
7. Detection and characterisation of endoleaks after AAA repair.
(Recommendation Level: A;1a)
8. Follow-up of AAA endoleaks. (Recommendation Level: A;1a)
18. Cerebral Vessels
!
18.1 Background
The major indication for CEUS in the examination of cerebral
arteries is the poor signal-to-noise ratio using unenhanced
Doppler US, which can prevent measurement of the Doppler
traces for distinguishing no flow, slow flow or low flow [171].
Contrast enhanced transcranial colour-coded duplex sonogra￾phy (CE-TCCS) is the best modality for simultaneously depict￾ing B-mode brain anatomy as well as vessel detection and flow
tracings.

18.2 Study procedures
Transducers for CEUS are the same as for CE-TCCS, namely sec￾tor 1.5 – 4MHz probes. There are two applications using UCAs:
main vessel, i. e. vascular imaging, and “perfusion imaging”. For
vascular imaging, UCAs are utilised to enhance Doppler signals
in transtemporal or transnuchal transverse axial planes (insona￾tion depth 10 – 12 cm). Coronal transtemporal planes may also
be used. In order to obtain adequate information, some techni￾cal artefacts should be considered: 1) bolus injection may cause
blooming artefacts preventing accurate Doppler spectral mea￾surements. This artefact can be reduced by reducing the total
gain or by slow infusion of the UCA (1 – 2 mL SonoVue®/min￾ute). 2) UCA injection leads to an artificial increase (15 – 36%)
in maximum blood flow velocity [172]. This may affect velocity
criteria in the classification of stenoses. In perfusion imaging, ei￾ther low or high MI CEUS is performed with transtemporal inso￾nation in the axial plane with an insonation depth of 10 to
15 cm. Other insonation planes may also be used.
18.3 Main intracerebral vessel imaging: interpretation
and evaluation
18.3.1 Vascular imaging
Most importantly, CE-TCCS is used to differentiate vessel occlu￾sion in poor insonation conditions, and to detect of very slow
blood flow velocities and low flow volumes (small vessels, ves￾sel pseudo-occlusion). The Doppler spectrum adds haemody￾namic information to the anatomical information provided by
colour Doppler US.
18.3.2 Examination of the anterior circulation
A poor temporal bone window, as seen in up to 45% of elderly
patients, can usually be overcome with CE-TCCS. In over 85%
of such cases the basal arteries of the circle of Willis can be
depicted satisfactorily after UCA administration [173]. Accord￾ing to expert opinion, CEUS with SonoVue® infusion can be
used in patients with poor acoustic windows for transcranial
Doppler monitoring to test cerebral autoregulation as well as
language lateralisation for surgical planning.
18.3.3 Examination of the posterior circulation
CE-TCCS through the foramen magnum can increase the depth
at which the intracranial vertebral arteries, the basilar artery,
and the cerebellar artery segments can be identified and thus
improve diagnostic confidence [172].
18.3.4. UCAs in patients with internal carotid artery stenosis
Characterisation of flow in the circle of Willis in patients with
internal carotid artery stenosis and poor bone windows is im￾portant for estimating the risk of ipsilateral border zone infarc￾tion. Patients without collateral flow are particularly vulner￾able to cross-clamping during carotid endarterectomy. The
use of UCA in these patients can provide valuable information
for patient management [174].
18.3.5 UCAs in stroke patients
In acute stroke, the basal cerebral arteries can only be detected
in 55 – 80% of cases with unenhanced TCCS. Fortunately, reliable
diagnoses can be obtained in more than 85% of these patients
after contrast enhancement, with correlative findings on angio￾graphy (MR, CTA or conventional angiography) in over 95% of
cases [171].
18.4 Perfusion imaging
CEUS is performed with transtemporal insonation in the axial
plane with an insonation depth of 10 to 15 cm in perfusion
imaging. Other insonation planes may also be used. CEUS per￾fusion imaging has been shown to improve prognostic assess￾ment in the acute phase and to provide comparable results to
CT [175, 176] and MRI [177]. After bolus injection, TICs can be
generated to extract features (time to peak intensity, peak in￾tensity, area under the curve, etc.) that describe the perfusion
characteristics quantitatively in standardised regions of inter￾est [171, 178].
18.5 Limitations
Despite UCA administration, only the proximal basilar artery
can be evaluated. The distal portion can be depicted transtem￾porally, leaving the middle portion as a diagnostic gap for CE￾TCCS. The quality of transtemporal precontrast scans is strong￾ly predictive of the potential diagnostic benefit from the ad￾ministration of an UCA. In patients without visible intracranial
structures and vessels on conventional B-mode and colour
Doppler US, there is little chance that CEUS will provide satis￾factory diagnostic information.
The combination of systemic thrombolysis and repeated ad￾ministration of a UCA over an hour in patients with middle
cerebral artery occlusion accelerates recanalisation but also in￾creases haemorrhage into the infarct [179]. While of greatest
interest as a way to enhance therapy (which has not yet been
fully evaluated) this is a potential risk when repeated CEUS
studies are performed.
The clinical value of the quantification of enhancement is lim￾ited by both physical and technical factors. Up to now, they
can only reliably characterise the absence of enhancement ra￾ther than the exact degree of blood supply impairment.
Recommended uses and indications
1. Contrast enhanced transcranial colour duplex sonography can
be diagnostic in patients with unsatisfactory intracerebral in￾formation with non-enhanced transcranial colour duplex so￾nography. (Recommendation Level: A:1b).
2. CEUS perfusion imaging based on quantification of brain en￾hancement provides prognostic information in acute stroke.
(Recommendation Level: C;4).
19 Inflammatory Joint Diseases
!
19.1 Background
Colour/power Doppler US can detect the vascularity in syno￾vial proliferation reflecting inflammatory activity. However,
these techniques have limited sensitivity and they benefit
from the addition of UCAs.
19.2. Study procedure
Reports on the use of UCAs in inflammatory joint disease are
mainly about the enhancement of signals detected by conven￾tional colour/power Doppler US (CE Doppler US), rather than
by using low MI CEUS. The standard probes and equipment
used for the second level investigation of joints are also uti￾lised for CEUS.

19.3 Image interpretation
19.3.1 Arthritis and synovitis
Microscopic examination of synovial biopsies shows angiogen￾esis from the earliest stages of inflammatory disease. Prolifera￾tion of hypervascularised pannus can be detected before joint
destruction. It correlates with disease activity and appears to
be crucial to its invasive and destructive behaviour [180].
Moreover, the development of novel biological therapies (e. g.
tumour necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors), which target the mi￾crovasculature, have created a demand for more sensitive vas￾cular imaging in order to assess response to treatment [180–
184]. The addition of UCAs to Doppler US significantly im￾proves the detection of vascularity in active rheumatoid arthri￾tis [185, 186]. Following CE Doppler US, therapy was modified
in up to 24% of patients in a dedicated study [185]. There is
also evidence that CE power Doppler US helps to differentiate
between active and inactive disease in subclinical juvenile
rheumatoid arthritis of the knee [187]. CE Doppler US corre￾lates with the findings of CEMRI, indicating the degree of in￾flammation in patients with synovitis [188]. CE Doppler US is
also more useful in the diagnosis of sacro-iliitis than conven￾tional unenhanced Doppler US [182, 189]. Overall, improved
diagnostic accuracy in assessing the degree of inflammation
can be achieved by the addition of UCA in large and small
joints.
19.3.2. Differentiation between synovial pannus and fluid
MRI studies have demonstrated that the presence and amount
of synovitis is a prognostic factor for bone damage [190]: no
bone damage occurs in joints without synovitis. Therefore, early
detection of vascularised synovia is a primary goal in assess￾ment of inflammation. CE Doppler US improves the differentia￾tion between active synovitis and other articular thickenings
such as fibrotic pannus and articular fluid [191, 192].
19.3.3. Bursae and tendons
Contrast administration can highlight peripheral enhancement
on Doppler US corresponding to the vascularised synovial lin￾ing of an inflamed bursa and can better differentiate between
fluid, fibrous and hypervascular synovial thickening in com￾parison to non-enhanced Doppler US [193, 194].
19.3.4 Therapeutic follow-up
Successful treatment results in a decrease in synovial thickening
and necrosis of the pannus with reduction of vascularity and
thus of Doppler signals. The distinction between fibrous pannus
and active synovial proliferation is one of the most important
questions during follow-up, because the volume of the syno￾vium itself is not clinically significant, as it may contain varying
amounts of fibrous tissue [190]. On unenhanced power Doppler
US, fibrotic pannus shows no vascularity as also after addition
of UCA into fibrotic pannus shows no vascularity, as it also
does after the addition of UCA and, with CEUS, lacks enhance￾ment [195–199].
Recommended uses and indications
Contrast enhanced colour/power Doppler US:
1. Can be utilised for further assessment of the degree of vascu￾larisation in joints of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. (Re￾commendation Level: C;2b)
2. Repeat contrast enhanced Doppler US may provide useful in￾formation on the response to treatment, to guide therapeutic
strategy. The technique has the potential to be utilised within
dedicated centres using standardised methodology. (Recom￾mendation Level: C;2b)
20. Intracavitary Uses
!
20.1. Introduction
Reports on numerous off-label extravascular or intracavitary
administrations of SonoVue® have been published and those
considered of more general use and most consistent are re￾ported. Other potential applications have been occasionally de￾scribed as case reports and congress abstracts.
20.2. Study procedure
To date, no standard dosage of UCA has been established for
intracavitary injection. The reported range is 0.1 mL–1 mL
SonoVue® (most commonly just a few drops) diluted in
10 mL or more of 0.9% saline; a higher content of SonoVue®
may be needed for high frequency US probes.
20.3 Injection into Physiological Cavities
20.3.1 Voiding US for vesicoureteral reflux
This topic is described in section 13.4.
20.3.2 Imaging of tubal patency – contrast enhanced
hystero-salpingo-contrast-sonography (CE-HyCoSy)
Originally performed using shaken saline infused into the uter￾ine cavity, hystero-salpingo-sonography suffers from a false
negative rate of patency of about 12% [200]. CEUS with Sono￾Vue® provides better results [200–202] with higher specificity,
but the positive predictive value for the diagnosis of “occluded
tube” remains low [200]. The high negative predictive value of
conventional hystero-salpingo-contrast-sonography leads au￾thors to suggest performing contrast enhanced hystero-salpin￾go-contrast-sonography only if conventional hystero-salpingo￾contrast-sonography does not show patency.
20.3.3 Detection of peritoneo-pleural communciation for the
diagnosis of hepatic hydrothorax
The detection of direct communication between the abdominal
and pleural cavities is the main indication reported so far
[203, 204]. Confirmation of the suspected diagnosis of hepatic
hydrothorax can be established in cirrhotic patients by inject￾ing SonoVue® into the peritoneal cavity, at best early (< 2 days)
after thoracentesis and demonstrating its passage into the
pleural cavity.
20.3.4 Bile ducts
CEUS-guided percutaneous cholangiography was first de￾scribed in 2009 [205]. A later case report on UCA injection
into a surgically placed T-tube followed [206]. It is expert
opinion that the advantage of CEUS-guided percutaneous cho￾langiography and drainage is that external drainage for biliary
obstruction in patients with severe cholangiosepsis can be
performed in the intensive care unit without X-ray guidance.
UCA for endoscopic retrograde cholangiography has been
reported [207].
20.3.5 Salivary glands
UCA injected into the main duct of a salivary gland could be￾come a supplementary diagnostic method added to sialogra￾Piscaglia F et al. The EFSUMB Guidelines… Ultraschall in Med 2012; 33: 33–59

phy to classify obstructive diseases of the salivary glands. The
salivary gland is cannulated with appropriate dilatators and
the plastic tube of a peripheral vein catheter is inserted [208].
20.4 Injection into Non-Physiological Cavities
20.4.1 CEUS for imaging of fistula
CEUS detection and classification of fistulas, whatever the in￾itial disease, has been proven to be effective. The following
conditions have been reported: rectovaginal fistulas via a
transvaginal approach [77], vesicointestinal fistulas via a trans￾abdominal approach [209] and anal fistulas via the transrectal
approach [210].
20.5 Other intracavitary indications for CEUS
In principle, UCAs can be instilled into any sonographically ac￾cessible physiological or pathological body cavity to assess
morphology of the cavity and potential communications with
adjacent structures or organs. Clinical applications include: ab￾scesses, pancreatic pseudocysts and other complications of
pancreatitis, intestinal and other fistulas, gastro-oesophageal
reflux, gastric lumen and intestinal stenoses.
Recommended uses and indications
No definite recommendation can be made for these indica￾tions. Use of CEUS must be decided on a case-by-case basis,
usually resorting to CEUS because of inconclusive standard di￾agnostic techniques or when patients are not suitable for these
or because they have higher risks (for instance, use of ionizing
radiation on sensitive organs, or moving the patient out of in￾tensive care units) or more complex logistic situations.
21 Lymph Nodes
!
21.1 Background
The differential diagnosis of superficial lymphadenopathy in
cancer patients has been the object of various studies with
high-resolution US. Their shape, appearance and vascular pat￾tern have been analysed to discriminate benign from malig￾nant nodes, with a wide range of sensitivities and specificities
[211, 212]. CEUS has been shown to increase the accuracy of
the analysis of the vascular pattern (angioarchitecture) [213].
Contrast enhanced investigations were first performed with
high MI US using Doppler and later with low MI CEUS.
21.2 Study procedure
The same probes as for conventional B-mode US are utilised
but with contrast-specific modalities and a full vial of Sono￾Vue®, as for other superficial applications.
21.3 Image interpretation and differential diagnosis of
benign and malignant lymph nodes
Demonstration of malignant neovascularisation, seen as vessels
penetrating the node’s capsule away from the hilum, has been
used in most reports as the characteristic feature of metastatic
lymph nodes. Confirmation of the reactive nature of lymph
nodes relies on their preserved morphology and vascular anat￾omy, with a single vascular pedicle at the hilum containing ar￾teries and veins vessels, regularly branching towards the per￾iphery of the lymph node. Display of vascular anatomy can be
facilitated by the addition of UCAs during colour Doppler US.
Conventional CEUS using low MI can improve on the results
of Doppler US with a sensitivity, specificity and accuracy rate
of up to 84%, 79% and 80% [214–223].
However, the US study of lymph node vascularisation has lim￾itations. Most studies were made in special clinical settings
(known head and neck or gynaecologic cancer). Vessel distri￾bution analysis is usually satisfactorily informative if the
whole lymph node is involved. This is not always the case, be￾cause of the possibility of focal cancer metastases or necrosis.
Lymphoma must be considered separately because there is
evidence that the vascular pattern of lymphoma lymph nodes
resembles that of non-malignant nodes [224, 225].
21.4 Sentinel lymph nodes
CEUS can be used for detecting sentinel lymph nodes in cancer
patients. One mL of SonoVue® is injected subcutaneously near
the tumour site and the enhanced lymphatics are traced to the
sentinel node [226–231]. Initial experiences indicates that the
method is not toxic and performs as well as the blue dye or
radioisotope methods [231].
Recommended uses and indications
1. CEUS appears to be capable of discriminating benign from ma￾lignant superficial lymph nodes only in special clinical set￾tings. Therefore, despite some positive publications, it is the
opinion of the experts that CEUS is not recommended for rou￾tine discrimination of benign from malignant lymph nodes.
(Recommendation Level: C;5)
2. CEUS with subcutaneous injection of contrast agent to identify
the sentinel lymph node is a field of ongoing research and can
therefore not be recommended for clinical practice to date.
(Recommendation Level: C;5)
22. Tumour Response Assessment
!
22.1 Background
The advent of novel therapies targeting tumour angiogenesis
and vascularity has highlighted the need for accurate and re￾producible quantitative techniques to assess early changes in
tumour vascularity [232]. However, as these therapies are pre￾dominantly cytostatic, current response assessment which is
based on interval evaluation of the tumour size using the Re￾sponse Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours (RECIST) [233] is
inadequate as it reflects only late changes and is unable to
identify non-responders at an early time-point [234].
22.2 Study procedure
Dynamic contrast enhanced US (DCE-US) can be performed
using two different approaches with different results and evi￾dence produced so far:
(a) bolus injection of UCA with TIC analysis; single plane ima￾ging is usually performed at 10 – 20 frames per second for the
duration of the enhancement. The average intensity within a
region of interest (ROI) can be displayed as a function of time,
i. e. a TIC which describes the wash-in and wash-out of the
UCA in the ROI [235]. In addition, a second ROI can be placed
in a reference tissue for comparison purposes [236]. The major￾ity of clinical studies to date are based on this method.
(b) intravenous infusion of UCA with disruption-replenishment
analysis. The UCA is administered using a pump or drip over
5 to 20 minutes. UCA is first imaged without being disrupted
at a low MI, then the MI is increased for a few frames, causing
Piscaglia F et al. The EFSUMB Guidelines… Ultraschall in Med 2012; 33: 33–59
Guidelines 49

bubble disruption. Immediately after that, the MI is returned
to the non-disrupting level to observe the replenishment of
the microbubbles into the ROI. Various models describe the
echo-signal dynamics during the UCA-replenishment phase,
which can be used for flow analysis [237].
Initially monitoring for tumour response with UCAs relied on
qualitative analyses [238], but new methodologies have been
developed to produce more robust and semi-quantitative indi￾ces. Analyses of the TIC, including wash-in and wash-out
times, can be performed with curve fitting to determine func￾tional indices [239]. The main indices include: peak intensity
(PI); area under the curve (AUC); area under the wash-in
(AUWI); area under the wash-out (AUWO; all corresponding
to blood volume); time to peak intensity (TPI); slope of the
wash-in (SWI; both corresponding to blood flow); and mean
transit time (MTT). No permeability information can be ob￾tained because of the pure blood pool nature of microbubbles.
A more extensive EFSUMB introduction to quantitative en￾hancement indices is being prepared.
22.3 Clinical application of DCE-US
Early clinical trials employed qualitative analysis in the assess￾ment of the response of different tumours such as gastro￾intestinal stromal tumour (GIST) or renal cell carcinoma
[240–243]. More recently, there have been studies using
semi-quantitative techniques with UCA bolus injection in renal
cell carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and GIST
[244–246]. Studies from the French group showed that two
indices representing blood volume correlated with the RECIST
response. For one study on renal cell carcinoma the authors
demonstrated a correlation of such indices with Progression
Free Survival and Overall Survival [244]. The same results
could not be reproduced in a Canadian study using the disrup￾tion-replenishment technique tested versus Progression Free
Survival assessed by the RECIST method [237].
A French multicentre study of various types of tumours, ap￾proximately half of which were located outside the liver (in￾cluding more than 400 patients), such as metastatic renal cell
carcinoma, GIST, colon cancer, melanoma, breast cancer and
HCC, treated with anti-angiogenic therapies has been running,
but not yet reported in its complete form. The preliminary re￾sults found that the AUC is one of the features correlated to
response at 6 months in good and poor responders [247], but
the full results of the data set are not yet available. There is
now emerging evidence that DCE-US may be used with appro￾priate tools to differentiate between responders and non-re￾sponders at an earlier stage than conventional methods and
this potentially allows tailoring of the treatment regimen, par￾ticularly changing treatment for non-responders. DCE-US has
been endorsed by the European Medical Oncology Society to
assess response under biological therapy for GIST [248].
Recommended uses and indications
1. DCE-US can be utilised to assess response to biologic therapy
in metastatic GIST and other metastatic tumours, e. g. renal
cell carcinoma, in dedicated centres with appropriate soft￾ware for contrast signal quantification. (Recommendation
Level: A;1b)
23. Breast
!
The application of CEUS to the differential diagnosis of breast
masses was one of the first [249] and the initial results were
very encouraging. Sadly, this early promise has not been fulfil￾led, despite numerous studies using modern methods [250]
(summarised in [251]) including temporal accumulation meth￾ods (microvascular imaging) [252]. No specific pattern indicat￾ing malignancy has been identified. Thus, CEUS of the breast
remains an important topic for research but cannot be recom￾mended for routine clinical use. Among the different fields of
research, that on contrast quantification appears the most pro￾mising [253].
24. Adrenal Glands
!
So far, no CEUS criteria that can reliably differentiate between
benign (endocrine tumours and adenomas) and malignant
adrenal masses are known and indeed, the specificity of CEUS
in the diagnosis of malignant adrenal masses was reported to
be below 70% [254]. Malignant adrenal tumours may infiltrate
and occlude the adrenal vein. The vascularity of a tumour
thrombus can be shown by UCA and thus its charactar be de￾monstrated.
CEUS may demonstrate characteristic hypervascularity of some
adrenal gland tumours, e. g. pheochromocytoma, which typi￾cally also have necrotic regions with no contrast enhancement
[255].
25 Emerging Perspectives and Potential Future
Applications for CEUS
!
25A. Obstetrics and Gynaecology
25A.1 Obstetrics
The use of UCAs in obstetrics is not indicated because of lack
of testing and underlying fears of toxicity. There is older litera￾ture in humans on the topic but none that is recent in animal
models. It is unknown whether the microbubbles pass through
the placenta, though this seems unlikely. CEUS to assess a
pregnant mother should be balanced against the risk of other
modalities. The opportunities seem very limited and the sub￾ject is not considered further here.
25A.2 Gynaecology
25A.2.1 Uterus
Research has included uterine and cervical tumours [256],
flow differences between endometrial polyps and cancer
[257], and CEUS during uterine artery embolisation to treat
leiomyomas [258]. So far, no prospective trials confirm the
value of CEUS to assess uterine tumours and thus there is no
proven clinical indication for its use in examining the endo￾metrium or the myometrium.
25A.2.2 Adnexa
Differentiation of benign from malignant adnexal masses was
attempted by visual assessment of contrast distribution and
by quantification of enhanced Doppler signals but, despite
some difference in average values for some variables, no fea￾ture with sufficient clinical potential was obtained [259].
Piscaglia F et al. The EFSUMB Guidelines… Ultraschall in Med 2012; 33: 33–59
50 Guidelines
Downloaded by: NYU. Copyrighted material.

By using CEUS it was demonstrated that adnexal masses with￾out internal enhancement are invariably benign, and this fea￾ture was detected with high intra- and interobserver reprodu￾cibility [258], but the presence of enhancement is not a specific
sign of malignancy [256]. CEUS does not greatly improve the
accuracy of colour Doppler US for the diagnosis of malignancy
in adnexal masses [260]. A large multicentre study on the diag￾nosis of malignancy in adnexal masses, including quantitative
CEUS features, confirmed that CEUS is not superior to conven￾tional US, despite being statistically more accurate [260]. Both
also have difficulty in distinguishing between benign and bor￾derline tumours.
At present, there are no recommended gynaecological clinical
indications for the use of CEUS, despite the finding that ab￾sence of any enhancement in adnexal masses corresponds to
benign lesions. (Recommendation Level: A;2b).
25B. Perineum
CE perineal US is an effective, easily available but so far not
well known diagnostic tool. Perineal US is particularly useful
if clinical examination, endorectal US or MRI with endorectal
coils cannot be performed (e. g., due to severe pain when in￾troducing the probe). CE perineal US requires good knowledge
of the anatomy of the pelvic floor and the sphincters. No pa￾tient preparation is required. The location of inflammatory
and neoplastic lesions should be described in relation to the
sphincter apparatus. Fistulas can be further differentiated by
US examination into intersphincteric, transsphincteric and ex￾trasphincteric forms. Conventional B-mode perineal US is in￾adequate for complex fistulas, as its sensitivity for the complex
branching structure is poor. However, discrimination of fistu￾las and abscesses with CE perineal US is possible in most
cases, but studies have not been published so far. Additionally,
the extent of a fistula can be imaged by instillation of UCA
into its external ostium. CE Doppler US has shown a higher re￾sistance index (RI) in neoplasia compared to inflammation, but
further studies are needed.
25C. Urinary Bladder
25C.1 Background
In patients with urinary bladder tumours, noninvasive diag￾nostic imaging may play a role, even though it cannot replace
cystoscopy and pathologic staging. The depth of wall invasion,
as well as the histological grade and the extension outside the
bladder are the three main factors determining prognosis and
therapeutic approach.
25C.2 Study procedure
Optimal bladder filling (approximately two thirds of the total
bladder volume) is critical [261]. Insufficient filling prevents
lesion detection, while excessive distension results in bladder
wall thinning and reduced conspicuity of the wall layer and
may make it more difficult to differentiate a superficial tu￾mour from an infiltrating lesion.
The layers of the bladder wall can be differentiated after mi￾crobubble injection. The mucosa, and especially the submuco￾sal layer, exhibit early and intense enhancement that persists
for 1 – 2 minutes. The muscular layer has lesser and delayed
enhancement [261].
25C.3 Image interpretation
25C.3.1 Characterisation of mural masses
CEUS improves the differential diagnosis of intraluminal echoic
masses, allowing the detection of tumours, which are vascular￾ised and thus enhance [262], while clots do not enhance [263].
In a group of 35 patients in whom cystoscopic biopsy was the
reference standard, CEUS correctly assessed the presence or
absence of tumour in 88% of cases [263].
25C.3.2 Bladder tumour staging
CEUS is superior to conventional B-mode US in identifying in￾filtration of the muscle layer [261], but MRI and CT are the
imaging modalities of choice for local staging of bladder
tumours. Attempts to predict tumour grading by the pattern
of CEUS enhancement is still a research topic [262].
25C.4 Limitations
Similarly to other imaging modalities, the most important lim￾itation of CEUS in bladder tumour detection is the difficulty in
identifying subcentimetre lesions. Flat, plaque-like tumours
may also be difficult to detect, even when large. Tumour posi￾tion can affect the quality of depiction at CEUS, and therefore
the accuracy of staging. Tumours in the anterior portion of the
bladder dome are sometimes difficult to visualise. Columnar
hypertrophy of the bladder wall associated with benign pros￾tate hypertrophy can hide or mimic urothelial polypoid projec￾tions, as well as prostate hypertrophy itself [261]. Benign tu￾mours and focal cystitis are other uncommon conditions that
present with focal bladder wall enhancement and can mimic
a malignant lesion. Finally, CEUS is not panoramic as CT and
MR are.
To summarize, the most useful application of CEUS is the dif￾ferential diagnosis of bladder cancer from clots in patients
with haematuria when the diagnosis is equivocal on conven￾tional B-mode and Doppler US. (Recommendation Level:
C;2b). In patients with anatomical situations leading to poor
urinary bladder visualisation, CEUS often does not provide
the desired information. (Recommendation Level: X;5).
25D. Transplanted Kidney
Progressive vascular remodelling in the transplanted kidney,
from a variety of mechanisms, compromises renal perfusion
and accounts for the majority of allograft failures. CEUS has
the potential to investigate perfusion abnormalities in renal
transplants and to obtain information on blood flow based on
the quantification of contrast enhancement or on the depic￾tion of devascularised regions (the latter with the same signif￾icance as in native kidneys, so that CEUS use for this indication
can be considered as established also in transplanted kidneys).
Different quantitative features have been assessed, all related
to impaired parenchymal perfusion (e. g. longer time to peak,
lower wash-in slopes, longer mean-transit time) and associ￾ated with a worse prognosis of graft function and survival
[264].
Although these preliminary results are promising, further stu￾dies are needed to assess whether detecting haemodynamic
changes in renal grafts affects the management of patients
with poorly functioning transplants; consequently the quanti￾fication of CEUS is still considered a research field in trans￾plant assessment.

25E. Prostate Cancer
Conventional B-mode and Doppler transrectal US imaging have
a limited role in the detection of prostate cancer because of
poor sensitivity and specificity (approximately 50 – 60%). How￾ever, there is a correlation between microvascular density and
the presence of prostate cancer, its stage and survival. There￾fore, attempts were made with CE transrectal US with colour￾Doppler to improve the detection of additional cancer nodules;
with this modality the detection rate of targeted biopsies in￾creased by almost 50% compared to systematic biopsies in
some studies [265, 266]. Low MI transrectal CEUS became avail￾able only recently when contrast specific modalities were im￾plemented on endocavitary probes. Preliminary single centre re￾sults appeared to confirm the findings of CE Doppler US, despite
the lack of specificity of enhancing areas and of any other pat￾tern [267–269]. The evidence achieved so far with CEUS modal￾ities is, however, still too limited and not sufficiently confirmed
in clinical practice in other centres, so that the role of CEUS in
prostate cancer should still be considered a research topic, with
hopes of improvements as new techniques are becoming avail￾able, such as 4D contrast enhanced transrectal US imaging.
25F. Aorto-Caval Fistula
Perioperative mortality of abdominal aortal aneurysms compli￾cated by aorto-caval fistulas undergoing open surgery is up to
60% and the additional retroperitoneal rupture of the aneur￾ysm considerably raises the mortality [270]. The diagnosis
can be made by noninvasive testing, such as US scanning, in￾cluding CEUS, which improves visualisation of the fistula track
and of the number of fistulas, avoiding the aliasing or the
overwriting artefacts typical of Doppler US.
25.G Free Tissue Transplants
25G.1. Background
Free flap reconstruction of complex defects after trauma, tu￾mour resection, burns, or wound healing disturbances has re￾volutionized plastic, reconstructive, and microsurgery, giving
the unprecedented potential to provide form, function, and vo￾lume for defects in every body region. However, despite re￾finements in this technique over the last several decades that
have resulted in a decreased rate of flap loss of less than 5 –
10%, in general, the loss of free flaps because of vascular im￾pairment remains a serious complication. Early identification
of vascular deterioration and prompt revision could save up
to 33-57% of failing flaps. CEUS offers the possibility of earlier
detection [271–273].
25G.2 Study procedure
Standard doses (2.4-4.8 mL of SonoVue®) and administration
methods are used together with high frequency probes
(≥ 6 MHz) to evaluate the microcirculation of the cutaneous,
subcutaneous, and deeper layers of free flaps. Beside the stan￾dard visual evaluation, improved diagnostic assessment is ob￾tained by contrast specific software working on the acquired
information, including the production of TIC in different tissue
layers by demarcation of different ROIs to quantify enhance￾ment (274). Postoperative TIC analysis allows calculation of
peak and time to peak of enhancement and regional blood
volume. Exported cine-loops allow colour-coded depiction of
these features with dedicated software [275, 276].
25G.3 Image Interpretation
25G.3.1 Preoperative planning of tissue transplants
The blood vessels in the transplanted free flap are small (at
most 1-2 mm). The surgeon needs to know the precise number,
course and position of these blood vessels as well as the flow in
order to estimate the proportion with a good blood supply.
25G.3.2 Intraoperative imaging
CEUS enables the identification of perforator vessels intra￾operatively, and helps to determine if there are any abnormal￾ities. The surgeon can thus make a more accurate decision as
to whether the entire flap is perfused and if the estimated flap
size is correct.
25G.3.3 Postoperative monitoring of tissue transplants
The feeding vessels or, if there is a connection to a bypass, the
anastomosis, and the transplant’s own vessels can also be ex￾amined even if the vessel diameter is very small. CEUS can
provide valuable information about a vascular compromise
(thrombosis, embolism, twisting, kinking, or compression) and
demonstrate successful surgical salvage [274, 277].
25G.3.4 Critical microvascularisation of free flaps
A significant difference between normally vascularised and
compromised flaps can be observed and the Time to Peak
and Regional Blood Flow appear to be the most useful indices
[278]. For CEUS and CEMRI, the mean signal increase of the
TIC was significantly higher in ROIs of normally perfused flaps
compared to compromised flaps [275, 276, 279, 280]. With
CEUS, the exact size of the necrotic regions can be evaluated
by analysing the entire flap. A haematoma or seroma can be
detected early with CEUS, by the absent perfusion.
25G.4 Limitations
The main limitation for the evaluation of flap perfusion is the
fact that CEUS does not allow for continuous monitoring after
bolus injection. Continuous infusion might be a better method,
but remains to be explored.
To summarise, high-resolution CEUS is promising for confirm￾ing a clinical suspicion of malperfusion of free tissue trans￾plants as well as for determining the cause. (Recommendation
Level: B;2b).
25 H. Biliary disease
25 H.1 Background
The vascular phases of the gallbladder are different from those
of the liver because the blood supply is provided entirely by
the cystic artery and not by portal vein branches. The arterial
phase is followed by the venous phase, which is shorter than
that of the liver.
25 H.2. Image interpretation
25 H.2.1 Acute cholecystitis
In acute cholecystitis, the detection or exclusion of abscess for￾mation in the surrounding liver parenchyma is important and
can be performed with CEUS, but published evidence is sparse
so far. Interruption of the gallbladder wall suggests perfora￾tion, which can be confirmed by the absence of enhancement
of the perforated wall.

52 Guidelines

25 H.2.2 Extrahepatic biliary tumours
The absence of enhancement in biliary sludge (whether in the
gallbladder or in a dilated biliary tree) allows differentiation
from a tumour, which enhances, in almost all cases using
CEUS.
Gallbladder carcinomas are typically hyperenhancing in the ar￾terial phase and hypoenhancing in the venous phase. The dif￾ferentiation between benign and malignant lesions is mainly
determined by clinical features and size and enlargment of
polyps to > 10 mm is an indication for cholecystectomy. More
sophisticated classification of the vascular and enhancement
pattern of gallbladder lesions, including that provided by
CEUS, has not been introduced so far in the clinical routine
and CEUS currently has no role in differentiating benign from
malignant gallbladder polyps.
The most important task of CEUS and other imaging methods
is to detect infiltration of the surrounding liver parenchyma
and to exclude liver metastases.
Transabdominal CEUS has no proven role when extrahepatic
cholangiocarcinoma is suspected, although promising findings
have been observed e. g., determining the depth of wall infil￾tration and surrounding tissue mainly by using CE-EUS.
Intrabiliary administration of UCA is discussed in 20.3.4.
26. Use of CEUS in Patients with Renal Failure
!
The use of iodinated/Gadolinium-containing contrast agents
for CT and MR, respectively, potentially exposes patients with
renal failure to severe complications [281, 282]. Assay of se￾rum creatinine level and calculation of the estimated glomer￾ular filtration rate before injection is mandatory in patients
who may have impaired renal function (diabetes mellitus, age
> 70 years, history suggesting possible reduced eGFR, conges￾tive heart failure, intensive diuretic treatment, dehydration,
etc). Recommended guidelines to avoid contrast-induced ne￾phrotoxicity from iodinated contrast agents [281] are available.
However, none can guarantee completely successful preven￾tion.
The risk of nephrotoxicity is very low with MRI contrast
agents, even in patients with impaired renal function. How￾ever, these agents can induce nephrogenic systemic fibrosis
(NSF), a rare but severe complication [282]. The risk of NSF de￾pends upon the degree of impairment of the patient’s renal
function and the type of agent (stability of the Gadolinium
bound to chelate).
Thus in patients with renal failure, it is recommended to con￾sider an alternative imaging method that does not use iodina￾ted or Gadolinium-containing contrast media. Since UCAs are
not nephrotoxic (and no renal function assessment is re￾quired), CEUS should be considered in every case, especially if
it offers the possibility of achieving enough diagnostic infor￾mation, even with off-label CEUS uses. This is particularly the
case in patients with severe renal failure, in whom CT or MRI
should only be used in case of inconclusive examinations and
strong clinical need.
27. Technical Appendices
!
The number of systems capable of CEUS imaging has increased
greatly in recent years and almost all manufacturers have im￾plemented this technique in top level as well as, in many in￾stances, in lower level machines. The technical details of the
modalities which produce CEUS imaging are rapidly and con￾tinuously evolving so that any written list of information would
not be complete. Accordingly, it is preferable that readers access
such technical information directly from the websites of each
