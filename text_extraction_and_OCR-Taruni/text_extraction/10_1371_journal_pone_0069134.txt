Abstract
Background: Cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) have been proven suitable for stem cell therapy after myocardial infarction,
especially c-kit(+)CPCs. CPCs marker c-kit and its ligand, the stem cell factor (SCF), are linked as c-kit/SCF axis, which is
associated with the functions of proliferation and differentiation. In our previous study, we found that stromal cell-derived
factor-1a (SDF-1a) could enhance the expression of c-kit. However, the mechanism is unknown.
Methods and Results: CPCs were isolated from adult mouse hearts, c-kit(+) and c-kit(2) CPCs were separated by magnetic
beads. The cells were cultured with SDF-1a and CXCR4-selective antagonist AMD3100, and c-kit expression was measured
by qPCR and Western blotting. Results showed that SDF-1a could enhance c-kit expression of c-kit(+)CPCs, made c￾kit(2)CPCs expressing c-kit, and AMD3100 could inhibit the function of SDF-1a. After the intervention of SDF-1a and
AMD3100, proliferation and migration of CPCs were measured by CCK-8 and transwell assay. Results showed that SDF-1a
could enhance the proliferation and migration of both c-kit(+) and c-kit(2) CPCs, and AMD3100 could inhibit these
functions. DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) mRNA were measured by qPCR, DNMT activity was measured using the DNMT
activity assay kit, and DNA methylation was analyzed using Sequenom’s MassARRAY platform, after the CPCs were cultured
with SDF-1a. The results showed that SDF-1a stimulation inhibited the expression of DNMT1 and DNMT3b, which are critical
for the maintenance of regional DNA methylation. Global DNMT activity was also inhibited by SDF-1a. Lastly, SDF-1a
treatment led to significant demethylation in both c-kit(+) and c-kit(2) CPCs.
Conclusions: SDF-1a combined with CXCR4 could up-regulate c-kit expression of c-kit(+)CPCs and make c-kit(2)CPCs
expressing c-kit, which result in the CPCs proliferation and migration ability improvement, through the inhibition of DNMT1
and DNMT3b expression and global DNMT activity, as well as the subsequent demethylation of the c-kit gene.

Introduction
Ischemic heart disease remain the leading causes of mortality
and morbidity worldwide, and stem cell therapy may regenerate
cardiac tissue directly by inducing neovasculogenesis and cardio￾genesis. In 2003, cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) were first
reported to reside in the adult heart [1–3]. Resident CPCs may
be particularly suitble for resurrecting dead myocardium because
they are endogenous components of the adult heart and appear to
be respnsible for the physiological and pathological turnover of
cardiac myocytes and other cardiac cells. The heart have several
populations of CPCs, which are self-renewing, clonogenic, multi￾potent and have the ability to proliferate and differentiate into
functional cardiomyocytes, smooth muscle cells, and other kinds of
cells [2,4–6]. Among these CPCs, c-kit(+)CPCs are especially
suitable in cell therapy for the recovery of injured cardiomyocytes
[2,4]. c-kit(+)CPCs have the larger numbers than other types of
CPCs, and have stronger proliferation and differentiation ability to
repair the injured myocardium [7].
c-kit is a proto-oncogene and a tyrosine kinase growth factor
receptor, expressed on several types of cells, including CPCs [8–
11], with the stem cell factor (SCF) as its ligand. c-kit expression is
related to the regulation of cell proliferation, and migration [12–
15]. Stromal cell-derived factor-1a (SDF-1a) is a member of the
CXC chemokine family, and CXCR4 is its receptor, which are
expressed in a variety of cell types, including CPCs [16]. SDF-1a
expression has been reported to increase after an acute myocardial
infarction [17]. SDF-1a/CXCR4 axis could prompt stem cell
homing to damaged cardiac tissue [16,18]. AMD3100 is a specific
antagonist to SDF-1a, which binds to CXCR4 competitively for
preventing the combination of SDF-1a and CXCR4. Recent
studies have indicated that SDF-1a/CXCR4 and c-kit/SCF axes
are closely linked [19]. Our study found that SDF-1a could
enhance c-kit expression. However, limited information is known
on the regulation of SDF-1a on c-kit.
DNA methylation is one of the important research content of
epigenetics, which cytosine is methylated in a reaction catalyzed
by DNA methyltransferases (DNMT), with S-adenosyl methionine
(SAM) as a methyl donor [20]. In mammalian cells, three
DNMTs, namely, DNMT1, DNMT3a, and DNMT3b, are
responsible for DNA methylation. DNMT1 is a maintenance
type methyltransferase, responsible for copying DNA methylation

patterns during DNA replication, whereas DNMT3a and
DNMT3b are essential for de novo methylation [20–25]. DNA
methylation is an important method in the regulatory mechanisms
of gene expression [20–29]. In several diseases such as cancer,
gene promoter CpG islands result in abnormal silencing [27–29].
A recent study has found that TGFb1 could regulate CD133
expression through the inhibition of DNMT1 and DNMT3b
expressions, and subsequently, the demethylation of promoter-1
[30]. However, the influence of SDF-1a on the expression of c-kit
by DNA methylation is unknown.
The present study demonstrates that SDF-1a combined with
CXCR4 could up-regulate c-kit expression of c-kit(+)CPCs and
make c-kit(2)CPCs expressing c-kit, which result in the CPCs
proliferation and migration ability improvement, through the
inhibition of DNMT1 and DNMT3b expression and global
DNMT activity, as well as the subsequent demethylation of the c￾kit gene.
Materials and Methods
Ethics Statement
All animal studies were carried out using a method approved
by the the Care of Experimental Animals Committee of the
Southeast University, and conform with the guidelines of the
National Research Council (approval ID: SYXK-2010.3908).
Isolation and culture of CPCs
For the isolation and culture of CPCs in our laboratory [31],
CPCs were acquired from the hearts of two-month-old wild-type
male C57BL/6 mice (Yangzhou Laboratory Animal Center).
The hearts were acquired using a method approved by the Care
of Experimental Animals Committee of the Southeast University,
Nanjing, China (Laboratory Animal Center of Southeast
University). CPCs were isolated following the standard method
described previously. After one or two weeks of growth, a layer
of fibroblast-like cells were generated from the adherent
myocardial tissue. On these fibroblast-like cells, several small,
round, and phase-bright cells emerged, which were collected by
the digestion of accutase enzyme, which did not affect the cell
surface markers (at room temperature, under direct visualization,
for a maximum of 3 min). The obtained cells were separated by
magnetic-activated c-kit cell sorting magnetic beads (Miltenyi
Biotec Inc., GER) following the instructions of the manufactur￾ers. Cells were seeded at 26104 cells/ml on poly-D-lysine
(Sigma, USA) coated dishes in cardiosphere growing medium

100U/ml penicillinG [Hyclone, USA], and 100 mg/ml strepto￾mycin [Hyclone, USA]).
Characterization of CPCs
CPCs were characterized by phase-contrast microscopy that
evaluates morphology and flow cytometric analysis to examine the
expression of stem cell surface markers. In the flow cytometric
analysis, CPCs were trypsinized and re-suspended in phosphate
buffered saline (PBS) and blocked with 3% FBS for 15 min. CPCs
were then labeled with PE-conjugated rat anti-mouse c-kit. FITC￾conjugated rat anti-mouse Sca-1 (BD Biosciences, USA) was
obtained at 4uC in a dark room for 30 min and then washed twice
with cold PBS. Data were collected from 16105 cells on a
FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, USA) and analyzed
using the WinMDI software.
Quantitative real-time PCR
Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, CA) was used to isolate total RNA
from cells, according to the instructions of the manufacturer.
First Strand cDNA was obtained by reverse transcription using
the cDNA synthesis kit (Fermentas, CA), according to the
instructions manufacturer. The cDNA were stored at 220uC
until use. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) was performed
using IQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad, USA). qPCR
experiments were also performed using BIO-RAD MJ Mini
Opticon Real-Time PCR System, and the matching analysis
software was the BIO-RAD CFX Manager. Relative gene
expression levels were calculated by normalization to GAPDH.
Sequences of each primer were designed as follows: GAPDH

Western blotting
Western blotting was performed as described in the following
sentences. An equal amount of cell lysates (40 mg protein) was
denatured in 26 SDS-PAGE sample buffer and electrophoresed
for 3 h at 20 mA on 10% polyacrylamide gels. The separated
proteins were then transferred into polyvinylidene difluoride
(PVDF) membranes blocked by TBST solution (10 mM Tris￾HCl, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.05% Tween-20), containing 5%
nonfat dry milk for 4 h at room temperature. Subsequently, the
proteins were incubated with primary antibodies (Santa Cruz,
1:1000 dilution), and placed on a rocker at 4uC overnight.
Afterward, the proteins were washed three times with TBST for
15 min, and mixed with IgG-HRP (Santa Cruz, 1:5000) for 2 h at
room temperature, which was also washed three times with TBST
for 15 min. GAPDH was used as loading control (Santa Cruz,
1:1000). The membranes were incubated in an enhanced
chemiluminescence detection system for 5 min, and imaged using
a five- minute exposure film. Protein expression was quantified by
scanning densitometry.
CPCs proliferation and migration
Cell proliferation assay was performed using CCK-8 kit (cell
counting kit-8) (Dojido, Japan). According to the manufacture’s
instruction, 5,106103 cells were seeded into 96-well culture
plates. Adhesion was verified once (about 12 h later), the cells
were incubated with SDF-1a (100 ng/ml for 48 h, Sigma) and
AMD3100 (5 mg/ml for 48 h, Sigma). Next, cells in each well
were incubated with 10 ml of CCK-8 at 37uC for 2 h. Then the
optical density (OD) for each well was measured at 450 nm using
a microplate reader (Bio-Rad Model 550, CA).
A cell migration assay was performed in 24-well Transwell
plates (8.0 mm, pore size) (Millipore, Billerica). The cells after
intervented with SDF-1a and AMD3100 were seeded into the
upper chamber of the transwell system at a concentration of
26104cells/well in 100 ml medium, and the lower chamber was
filled with 100 ng/ml SCF (Sigma) in 600 ml medium. After 6 h
of incubation at 37uC, 5% CO2, the upper sides of the filters
were carefully washed with PBS, and cells remaining were
removed with a cotton wool swab. The cells that migrated to the

bottom side of the filter were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde
and stained using 0.1% crystal violet. The number of migrated
cells were manually counted in three random fields per filter at
6200 magnification by a phase contrast microscope.
Nuclear DNMT Activity Assay
CPCs were stimulated with 100 ng/ml SDF-1a for 48 h.
Nuclear protein was extracted using a nuclear extraction kit
(Epigentek, Brooklyn, NY), Approximately 5 mg of nuclear
protein was applied for the DNMT activity assay, which was
performed using an EpiQuik DNMT activity assay kit (Epigen￾tek), according to the instructions of the manufacturer.
Bisulfite sequencing analysis
Bisulfite treatment: Genomic DNA sodium bisulfate conver￾sion was performed using the EZ-96 DNA methylation kit (Zymo
Research). The instruction of the manufacturer was followed,
using 1 mg of genomic DNA and the alternative conversion
method (a two-temperature DNA denaturation).
Methylation analysis: Quantitative methylation analysis was
carried out with Sequenom’s MassARRAY platform, using
MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry in combined with RNA base￾specific cleavage (MassCLEAVE). When feasible, amplicons were
designed to cover CpGs in the same region as the 59 untranslated
regions (59UTR). PCR primers were designed using Methprimer
(www.urogene.org/methprimer/). For each reverse primer, an
additional T7 promoter tag for in vivo transcription was added,
whereas a 10-meter tag on the forward primer was used to adjust
melting-temperature differences. MassCLEAVE biochemistry was
performed as described previously [32]. Mass spectra was acquired
by a MassARRAY Compact MALDI-TOF (Sequenom) and their
methylation ratios were generated using the Epityper software v1.0
(Sequenom).
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS (v 11.5, SPSS
Inc.). All values were presented as mean6SD. The differences
between the two groups were analyzed using the student’s T-test.
All tests were two tailed and statistical significance was accepted
if P,0.05.

Results
CPCs generation and phenotypic characterization
CPCs were acquired from the hearts of adult C57BL/6 mouse
by mild enzymatic digestion. c-kit(+)CPCs and c-kit(2)CPCs were
separated by magnetic-activated cell sorting. After approximately
10 days of culture, a layer of fibroblast-like cells emerged from
adherent myocardial tissues, followed by small, round and phase￾bright cells (Figures 1A). The inverted phase-contrast microscope
examinations showed that CPCs presented clone-like proliferation
(Figure 1B). c-kit(+)CPCs and c-kit(2)CPCs were characterized by
flow cytometric analysis of the cell surface markers, namely, c-kit
and Sca-1 (Figure 1C and 1D).
SDF-1a up-regulates c-kit expression in CPCs
C-kit-positive CPCs were divided into three groups, namely,
control, SDF-1a (treated with 100 ng/ml SDF-1a for 48 h), and
SDF-1a + AMD3100 groups (treated with 100 ng/ml SDF-1a
and 5 mg/ml AMD3100 for 48 h). The groups were analyzed
using western blotting and qPCR to identify protein and mRNA
level. We found that SDF-1a could up-regulate c-kit expression
of c-kit(+)CPCs and make c-kit(2)CPCs expressing c-kit at both
protein and mRNA levels, whereas AMD3100 could inhibit this
function (Figures 2A and 2B).
SDF-1a enhances proliferation and migration of CPCs
To determine whether SDF-1a will influence CPCs prolifera￾tion and migration toward SCF, we performed an in vitro CCK-8
assay and migration assay, and CPCs were placed under SDF-1a
with or without the CXCR4 specific antagonist AMD3100. The
results indicated that c-kit(+)CPCs proliferation rates of SDF-1a
group (0.16260.008 OD) increase significantly, compared with
that of control group (0.11460.002 OD) and SDF￾1a+AMD3100group (0.12560.003 OD), and c-kit(2) CPCs
proliferation rates of SDF-1a group (0.13560.004 OD) increase
significantly, compared with that of control group (0.06360.004
OD) and SDF-1a+AMD3100group (0.08060.006 OD)
(Figure 3A). And c-kit(+)CPCs migration rates of SDF-1a group
(SCF+SDF-1a) (602.3620.0 cells) also increase significantly,
compared with that of control group (with SCF, without SDF￾1a) (85.0611.8 cells), and inhibition group (with SCF+SDF￾1a+AMD3100) (138.7614.6 cells), and c-kit(-)CPCs migration
rates of SDF-1a group (SCF+SDF-1a) (272.0650.7 cells) also
increase signicantly, compared with that of control group (with
SCF, without SDF-1a) (37.065.0 cells), and inhibition group (with

(n = 3, mean6SD, P,0.05).
SDF-1a inhibits DNMT1 and DNMT3b expression
CPCs were divided into three groups, namely, control, SDF￾1+AMD3100 and SDF-1a groups to examine whether DNMT
regulates c-kit expression through methylation of the promoter.
DNMT1, DNMT3a, and DNMT3b expression was examined in
each group. The results showed that DNMT expression, include
DNMT1, DNMT3a, and DNMT3b, was significantly higher in c￾kit(2)CPCs compared to c-kit(+)CPCs, and SDF-1a combined
with CXCR4 was able to reduce the DNMT1 and DNMT3b
expression (Figures 4A, 4B and 4C). Subsequently, global DNMT
activity in c-kit(+)CPCs nuclei was significantly reduced, from
0.3360.02 mmol/hr/mg in the untreated cells to 0.1060.03 mmol/
hr/mg, and SDF-1a+AMD3100 group was 0.2660.15 mmol/
hr/mg, while, in c-kit(2)CPCs, from 0.7260.04 mmol/hr/mg
in the untreated cells to 0.4760.04 mmol/hr/mg, and SDF￾1a+AMD3100 group was 0.6660.03 mmol/hr/mg (n = 3, mean6SD,
P,0.05) (Figure 4D).
SDF-1a induces demethylation of c-kit promoter
With the suppression of DNMT mRNA expression and activity
by SDF-1a, we investigated whether SDF-1a induces c-kit
expression through promoter demethylation. A total of 16 CpG
sites in the promoter were divided into 11 CpG sites. c-kit forward

then divided into two groups, namely, control and SDF-1a groups.

Discussion
The key findings in our study are listed as follows: (1) An
adequate amount of CPCs could be obtained from adult mouse
heart tissue using enzymatic digestion, and c-kit(+)CPCs and c￾kit(2)CPCs could be separated by magnetic-activated cell sorting,
(2) SDF-1a combined with CXCR4 could up-regulate c-kit
expression of c-kit(+) CPCs and make c-kit(2)CPCs expressing
c-kit, this regulation could be suppressed by ADM3100, an
inhibitor of SDF-1a, (3) SDF-1a combined with CXCR4 could
enhance the proliferation and migration abilities of CPCs, and
these fuctions could be suppressed by AMD3100, (4)SDF-1a
combined with CXCR4 could up-regulated c-kit expression
through the inhibition of DNMT1 and DNMT3b expression
and global DNMT activity, as well as through subsequent
demethylation of the c-kit gene.
In regenerating the functional cardiac tissue, stem cell therapy is
an effective method for the recovery of the injured myocardium.
We selected CPCs because of their incomparable cardiac
regenerative capacity [33–34]. Presently, CPCs are based exclu￾sively on the expression of a stem cell-related surface antigen,
namely, c-kit and Sca-1. CPCs are multipotent, self-renewing, and
clonogenic, which have the ability to transform cardiomyocytes in
normal, as well as in aging and diseased hearts. CPCs apparently
have a mixture of different subpopulations. Among these CPCs, c￾kit(+)CPCs showed better cardiac repair capability thus are
considered as the most suitable cells for myocardial regeneration
therapies [35]. Hence, in this study, we selected the marker, c-kit,
as the identification index of CPCs, as observed in the heart. Our
study verified that, an adequate amount of CPCs could be
acquired from an adult mouse heart through enzymatic digestion,
c-kit(+)CPCs and c-kit(2)CPCs could be separated by magnetic￾activated cell sorting. CPCs within 10 generations, which we had
actually examined for c-kit expression, were used for these
experiments. Researches showed that c-kit (+)CPCs could be
passaged to the 40 generation, and still had kept the stem cell
surface markers [36].
c-kit is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase factor receptor. Its
ligand, SCF, is an early hemopoietic growth factor. c-kit/SCF axis
supports the proliferation and migration of multiple hemopoietic
lineages [37–39]. SDF-1a belongs to the CXC subfamily, which
has the ability to facilitate the transmigration of hematopoietic
cells through endothelial cell barriers [40]. CXCR4 is its receptor,
a seven- transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor. SDF-1a
expression is aimed to protect against myocardial ischemic injury
[41], which is critical in progenitor cell tissue retention, trafficking,
and homing [42]. SDF-1a expression has been shown to enhance
the survival of progenitor cells in several stimuli such as in
ischemia/reperfusion injury [43–44], serum withdrawal and
apoptotic cell death, through interaction with CXCR4 [45].
AMD3100 is a specific antagonist to SDF-1a, which competitively
binds to CXCR4 to prevent the combination of SDF-1a and
CXCR4, effectively blocking.90% of binding SDF-1a [46]. A
recent study showed that AMD3100 with the concentration of
5 mg/ml could efficiently prevent the SDF-1a/CXCR4 axis [47].
In our study, we found that SDF-1a combined with CXCR4 could
up-regulate c-kit expression of c-kit(+)CPCs and make c￾kit(2)CPCs expressing c-kit, which result in the CPCs proliferation
and migration abilities improvement. Research showed
VEGFMSCs could induced SDF-1a and CXCR4 expression,
and promoted CSCs proliferation and migration, whereas
blockade of SDF-1a or its receptor CXCR4 by RNAi or
antagonist significantly diminished these beneficial effects of
VEGFMSCs [48]. Our results were similar to these results, and
the conclusion was that SDF-1a/CXCR4 axis could affect CSCs
proliferation and migration. However, the mechanism is not quite
clear.
DNA methylation is an important mechanism for gene
transcriptional silencing. CpG hypermethylation in DNA pro￾moter regions is responsible for gene silencing [49–51]. DNA
methylation status was regulated by DNMT, which has de novo
methylation activity. We found that SDF-1a combined with
CXCR4 could inhibit global DNMT activity. Furthermore,
DNMT expression, include DNMT1, DNMT3a, and DNMT3b,
was significantly higher in c-kit(2)CPCs compared to c￾kit(+)CPCs, and DNMT1 and DNMT3b expression was
suppressed by the stimulation of SDF-1a combined with
CXCR4. Therefore, DNMT1 and DNMT3b are critical
enzymes in the mechanism of SDF-1a combined with CXCR4
induced c-kit expression. Meanwhile, Bisulfite sequencing anal￾ysis was chosen to quantify the promoter methylation degree in
multiple CpG sites. Our data demonstrated that SDF-1a
significantly reduces c-kit promoter methylation of c-kit(+)CPCs
in five out of seven CpG sites, and all of seven CpG sites for c￾kit(2)CPCs. Therefore, the 7th and 15th CpG sites probably
play an important role in the expression of c-kit gene in c￾kit(2)CPCs. Although the effect of SDF-1a on methylation in
individual CpG sites is relatively small, the overall effect of
accumulated demethylation induced by SDF-1a in multiple CpG
sites has significant influence on c-kit transcription. Therefore,
SDF-1a induced demethylation in the c-kit promoter is
important in the regulation of c-kit transcription.
Our study demonstrated that SDF-1a combined with CXCR4
could regulate c-kit expression, which result in the CPCs
proliferation and migration ability improvement, and this function
could be suppressed by ADM3100. Furthermore, the up￾regulation of c-kit expression by SDF-1a combined with CXCR4
is through the inhibition of DNMT1 and DNMT3b expression
and the global DNMTs activity, as well as through the subsequent
demethylation of the c-kit gene. In summary, this study described
a mechanism by which SDF-1a combined with CXCR4 regulates
c-kit expression through promoter demethylation. However, no
clue about the mechanism of the inhibiting effect of SDF-1a
combined with CXCR4 to DNMT was found so far. We will
continue to search for the possible mechanism. Our current
findings provided a novel strategy for stem cell therapy in
recovering damaged myocardium through the modification of the
status of c-kit promoter methylation by potentially targeting SDF￾1a or DNMTs.
