Abstract
Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is used to treat biliary disorders; and, bile acids alter mast cell (MC) histamine release. MCs
infiltrate Mdr2−/− mice liver (model of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC)). MC-derived histamine increases
inflammation, hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation and fibrosis. The objective was to determine the effects of UDCA
treatment on MC infiltration, biliary damage, inflammation and fibrosis in Mdr2−/− mice and human PSC. Wild-type and
Mdr2−/− mice were fed bile acid control diet or UDCA (0.5% wt/wt). Human samples were collected from control and PSC
patients treated with placebo or UDCA (15 mg/kg/BW). MC infiltration was measured by immunhistochemistry and
quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) for c-Kit, chymase, and tryptase. The HDC/histamine/histamine receptor
(HR)-axis was evaluated by EIA and qPCR. Intrahepatic bile duct mass (IBDM) and biliary proliferation was evaluated by
CK-19 and Ki-67 staining. Fibrosis was detected by immunostaining and qPCR for fibrotic markers. Inflammatory
components were measured by qPCR. HSC activation was measured by SYP-9 staining. Inflammation was detected by
qPCR for CD68. In vitro, MCs were treated with UDCA (40 μM) prior to HA secretion evaluation and coculturing with
cholangiocytes or HSCs. BrDU incorporation and fibrosis by qPCR was performed. UDCA reduced MC number, the HDC/
histamine/HR-axis, IBDM, HSC activation, inflammation, and fibrosis in Mdr2−/− mice and PSC patients. In vitro, UDCA
decreases MC-histamine release, which was restored by blocking ASBT and FXRβ. Proliferation and fibrosis decreased after
treatment with UDCA-treated MCs. We conclude that UDCA acts on MCs reducing histamine levels and decreases the
inflammatory/hyperplastic/fibrotic reaction seen in PSC. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is used to treat biliary disorders;
and, bile acids alter mast cell (MC) histamine release. Following liver injury like primary sclerosing cholangitis in mice and
humans, MCs infiltrate. MC-derived histamine increases biliary damage, fibrosis, and inflammation. UDCA treatment
decreases these parameters via reduced MC activation.
Introduction
Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic chole￾static disease that damages bile ducts inside and outside the
liver. During PSC, bile ducts are inflamed, which leads to
scarring and narrowing resulting in fibrosis and cirrhosis of

the liver and, eventually, liver failure [1]. The only defini￾tive treatment to date is liver transplantation [1, 2]. Multi￾drug resistance-2 gene knockout mice (Mdr2−/−) develop
spontaneous liver fibrosis and mimic some features of
human PSC [3, 4]. Mdr2−/− mice have enhanced intrahe￾patic bile duct mass (IBDM), biliary proliferation and
hepatic fibrosis between 4 and 12 weeks of age [4, 5].
Within MCs are intact granules that carry inflammatory
mediators like histamine and various cytokines and che￾mokines [6–8]. MCs infiltrate the liver upon damage, sur￾round bile ducts increasing local histamine levels and
enhance biliary mass, proliferation, and hepatic fibrosis [5,
9]. In our previous work, we demonstrated that, in bile duct￾ligated (BDL) rats and Mdr2−/− mice treated with the MC
stabilizer, cromolyn sodium, there is reduced biliary
damage and liver fibrosis [5, 9]. In MC-deficient mice,
IBDM and hepatic fibrosis are reduced following BDL
compared to WT BDL mice [10]. In addition, when MC￾deficient mice were injected with cultured MCs, these
parameters increased demonstrating that MCs regulate
biliary injury and hepatic fibrosis [10].
Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is a natural bile acid that
forms about 1–3% of total bile acids in human bile [11]. To
date, UDCA (13–15 mg/kg/day) is the choice treatment for
primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) patients that have abnor￾mal liver enzymes; however, the role of UDCA in PSC has
remained elusive and conflicting [11]. In fact, at high doses
(28–30 mg/kg/day) UDCA can be harmful to PSC patients
and studies to demonstrate effectiveness at lower doses are
inconclusive [1]. UDCA exerts its anticholestatic effects by
lowering serum liver enzymes, improving histology and
increasing nontoxic bile acid pools, thus delaying the pro￾gression to liver transplant [2, 12, 13]. UDCA has been
shown to regulate inflammatory cytokine release during
cholestatic liver injury [14]. According to the 2009 Eur￾opean Association for the Study of Liver Disease (EASL),
UDCA is an approved therapy for PSC patients and
numerous patients are prescribed UDCA to ameliorate
uncomfortable side effects [15]. The purpose of our study is
to understand if UDCA acts on MCs or induces a synergistic
interaction between MCs, cholangiocytes and hepatic stel￾late cells. Since it is unknown if UDCA interacts with MCs
to alter PSC progression, we aimed to studied these para￾meters in both Mdr2−/− mice and human PSC.
Method and materials
Reagents and other materials
Chemical grade reagents were purchased from Sigma￾Aldrich Co (St. Louis, MO) unless stated otherwise. All
mouse and human primers and real-time PCR materials
were obtained from Qiagen (Fredrick, MD). Antibodies for
immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence were pur￾chased from Abcam (Cambridge, MA) or Santa Cruz
(Dallas, TX). Histamine EIA kits were purchased from
Cayman Chemical (An Arbor, MI) [5, 9, 10]. The apical
sodium-bile acid transporter inhibitor was obtained from
Tocris Bioscience (Minneapolis, MN) and the farnesoid X
receptor (FXRβ) inhibitor was obtained from Sigma￾Aldrich Co (St. Louis, MO). Kits to measure total bile
acids (TBAs) were purchased from Crystal Chemical, Inc
(Downers Grove, IL) [5].
In vivo models
We used the genetically modified mouse model of PSC,
Mdr2−/− mice on FVB/NJ background (wild-type, WT) [3,
5]. All mice were housed in the Baylor Scott and White
Health Animal Facility and given free access to drinking
water and standard chow. All animals were kept in a
temperature-controlled environment with a 12:12 light/dark
cycle, and all protocols strictly adhered to regulations as set
forth by the local IACUC committee. Male mice
(9–11 weeks of age) were fed a bile acid control diet (BAC,
which contains the same components as the UDCA chow
minus the bile acids)—or UDCA—enriched diet (0.5% wt/
wt) [16] for 1 week (10–12 mice per group). Diets were
obtained from Dyets, Inc. (Bethlehem, PA) and from all
animals we collected serum, isolated cholangiocytes (as
previously described [5, 10, 17]) and supernatants (collected
after 4–6 h of incubation at 37° [5, 9, 10]) and liver blocks
(frozen and paraffin-embedded). We performed hematox￾ylin and eosin (H&E) staining in livers to evaluate lobular
damage, hepatic necrosis and inflammation. TBAs were
measured in serum and/or snap liver as previously described
[5].
Human PSC sampling
Human liver sections from normal controls (collected as part
of liver cholangiocarcinoma resection and considered non￾diseased areas) and PSC patients treated with placebo or
UDCA (15 mg/kg/BW) were utilized (Supplementary
Table 1). PSC patients presented with a range of early to late
PSC as described in our previous work [5]. Liver sections
(4–5 μm thick) obtained by needle biopsies from three control
patients, three early stage PSC (with or without cirrhosis) and
three early stage PSC patients treated with UDCA (with or
without cirrhosis). The deidentified samples were provided by
Dr. Pietro Invernizzi under a protocol approved by Humanitas
Research Hospital; the protocol was approved by the Central
Texas Veteran’s Health Care System Institutional Review
Board and Research Development Committee. Using
acquired human tissue, H&E was performed to assess liver

damage that was evaluated by a blinded pathologist; patient
serum ALT levels were assessed via colorimetric analysis
with an AbCam ALT kit (ab105134).
Detection of MCs, MC markers, HR, and histamine
secretion
In all mice, MC presence was detected by immunohis￾tochemistry in liver sections (4–5 μM thick) for mouse MC
protease-1 (mMCP-1) and MC markers were measured in
total liver by real-time PCR [9, 18]. The HDC/histamine
receptor (HR)/HA-axis was measured by real-time PCR and
by EIA from all groups of mice [17]. We measured MC
number by toluidine blue staining in liver from normal rats
fed either taurocholate (TC) or taurolithocholate (TLC) [19,
20], and in BDL rats fed UDCA [21].
We measured the expression of MC presence by
immunohistochemistry for tryptase in human liver sections
from control and PSC patients treated with placebo or
UDCA. The gene expression of MC markers was also
measured in these livers. H1–H4HR expression was mea￾sured by real-time PCR and histamine secretion was eval￾uated by EIA in serum from all patient groups.
Evaluation of biliary damage in Mdr2−/− mice and
hepatic fibrosis/HSC activation in mice and human
PSC
In liver sections from all mice, we performed immunohis￾tochemistry for the biliary marker, CK-19 [9, 17] to
measure IBDM and Ki-67 [5] to detect the percentage
of proliferating cholangiocytes as previously described
by us. We measured fibrosis and HSC activation from
all mice and human tissues as previously described by
us [5, 9, 10].
Fibrosis was assessed by Masson’s Trichrome and Fast
Green/Sirius Red (along with semiquantification) [17]. In
total liver, we measured the following fibrotic markers by
real-time PCR: collagen type-1a and fibronectin-1[17].
TGF-β1 is a known regulator of HSC-driven fibrosis [5,
13]; therefore, we measured TGF-β1 expression by real￾time PCR in all groups of mice. To evaluate HSC activa￾tion, synaptophysin 9 (SYP-9) was measured by immuno￾fluorescence in all mice groups co-stained with CK-19 to
detect bile ducts [5, 10]. In human tissues, we measured the
gene expression of fibronectin-1 [22, 23] and performed
Masson’s trichrome.
Measurement of the effects of UDCA treatment on
inflammation and extracellular matrix proteins
We measured CD68 in our mouse tissues as an indicator of
inflammatory response by real-time PCR. TNF-α is released
from degranulated MC [18]; therefore, we evaluated the
expression of TNF-α in total liver from all mice by real-time
PCR. We measured MMP-2, -3, and -9 by real-time PCR in
total liver from WT, Mdr2−/− + BAC and Mdr2−/− +
UDCA.
In vitro evaluation of MC/cholangiocyte/HSC
interactions
To determine the direct effects of UDCA on (i) MC-derived
histamine release and (ii) biliary and HSC response, we
utilized cultured MCs, cholangiocytes, and human HSCs
(hHSCs).
Cultured MCs were obtained from ATCC (Manassas,
VA) and human HSCs from ScienCell, Carlsbad, CA.
Murine cholangiocytes have previously been used by us and
all cells were cultured according to previous protocols [5, 9,
10, 17].
To determine how bile acids interact with MCs, we
measured the expression of ASBT and FXRβ by immuno￾fluorescence in cultured MCs. The ASBT antibody was a
kind gift from Dr. Paul Dawson (Emory University School
of Medicine) and FXRβ antibodies were purchased from
Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Dallas, TX).
To demonstrate that bile acid treatment alters MC￾histamine release, MCs were treated with UDCA (40 μM,
30–120 min) in the absence or presence of specific
antagonists, guggulsterone (FXRβ inhibitor, 10 μM) and
SC-435 (ASBT inhibitor, 100 nM) and histamine release
was measured by EIA [10]. In separate experiments, MCs
were treated with different bile acids including TC (40 μM,
24 h) and TLC (40 μM, 24 h) as well as UDCA (40 μM,
120 min); MC activation, MMP-2, -3, and -9 and TNF-α
levels were evaluated by real-time PCR.
Next, cultured cholangiocytes or hHSCs were treated
with 0.1% BSA (basal), MC supernatants (basal-treated)
and MC supernatants collected following treatment with
UDCA (40 μM, 120 min). Biliary proliferation was eval￾uated by BrDU staining and fibronectin-1 was measured by
real-time PCR in treated HSCs [5, 10]. Biliary inflammation
was measured by real-time PCR in treated cells for TNF-α,
CCL-3, and IL-6.
In our final experiments, hHSCs were treated with 0.1%
BSA (basal) or cholangiocyte supernatants collected from
WT, Mdr2−/− + BAC and Mdr2−/− mice treated with
UDCA. Following stimulation for 24 h, the expression of
fibrosis markers including, TGF-β1, collagen type-1a and
fibronectin-1 were evaluated by real-time PCR.

analyzed or a two-way ANOVA when more than two
groups are analyzed, followed by an appropriate post hoc
test. p < 0.05 was considered significant.
Results
UDCA treatment ameliorates liver injury in Mdr2−/−
mice and human PSC
Extensive inflammation was found around bile ducts, which
was ameliorated in Mdr2−/− mice fed UDCA, which were
similar to WT (Fig. 1a). In Mdr2−/− mice fed UDCA, total
bile acid serum content decreased (Fig. 1b). According to
pathology reports, the WT mouse liver has no significant
histopathological findings; however, the Mdr2−/− mouse
fed BAC displays moderate to severe cholangitis with
prominent duct obliteration and bridging fibrosis that is
consistent with human PSC. Some bridging fibrosis and
inactive hepatitis was also noted in the Mdr2−/− mouse fed
BAC. Finally, in the Mdr2−/− mouse fed UDCA mild portal
inflammation was detected along with minimal bridging
fibrosis and mild cholangitis.
In human PSC, focal necrosis and inflammation
increased compared to controls, which were decreased in
PSC patients treated with UDCA (Fig. 1c). Further, serum
ALT levels increased in PSC patients compared to controls
and several patients treated with UDCA had decreased ALT
levels, although not all patients responded to UDCA
(Fig. 1d). For H&E staining, the pathology reports indicate
that there is mild steatohepatitis with limited fibrosis in the
human control sample, whereas the PSC liver displays bile
duct sclerosing cholangitis with bridging fibrosis and
potential bile duct obstruction. The PSC patient treated with
UDCA also displays mild sclerosing cholangitis; however,
no evidence of obstruction was noted.
To correlate our findings with human dosing, we esti￾mate that mice consumed a relative dose of 20–23 mg/kg
BW per day. This calculation was based on the amount of
UDCA in the diet, average weight of the mice, and average
chow consumed per day. As stated, normal/low dose
treatment is indicated at 13–15 mg/kg BW per day and
Fig. 1 a Mdr2−/− mice fed BAC displayed increased portal area
damage including inflammation, necrosis, and increased ductular
reaction compared to WT mice. b Total bile acids (TBAs) were
increased in serum in Mdr2−/− mice fed BAC compared to WT and
feeding with UDCA decreased TBAs in serum. c H&E in human
biopsies reveal increased inflammation and necrosis in PSC patients
compared to control, which are reduced in PSC patients treated with
UDCA. d Serum ALT levels are increased in patients with PSC
compared to control and ALT levels are decreased in two patients
treated with UDCA. Data are expressed as mean ± SEM of at least
eight experiments for TBA. *

higher doses are 28–30 mg/kg BW per day. Therefore, we
are slightly over the range of the lower human dose, but we
also recognize that there are multiple considerations that
might alter our calculations including changes in appetite,
which would influence the intake of the mouse.
UDCA treatment decreases MC presence/activation
and inhibits the HDC/histamine/HR-axis in Mdr2−/−
mice and human PSC
In Mdr2−/− mice, increased numbers of MCs (marked by
red arrows) are found in close proximity to bile ducts.
Further, UDCA treatment decreased MC number (Fig. 2a).
Semiquantification of the average number of MCs is also
shown. c-Kit, chymase and tryptase decreased in Mdr2−/−
mice fed UDCA (Supplementary Fig. 2a). In contrast, TC
and TLC feeding increased MC number (marked by red
arrows) in normal rats; whereas UDCA decreased MC
number in rats subjected to BDL (Supplementary Fig. 1A).
Patients with advanced PSC display a robust infiltration
of MCs (marked by red arrows) compared to control
(similar to our previous work no MCs were detected in
control [5], data not shown) and, in patients with PSC
treated with UDCA, there is a marked decrease in MC
presence (Fig. 2b). There is an upregulation of MC markers
in livers from PSC patients treated with placebo, which are
decreased in PSC patients treated with UDCA (Supple￾mentary Fig. 1B).
In Mdr2−/− mice fed UDCA, the HDC/HR/HA-axis
decreases (Figs. 3a and 4b). The expression of H1–H4HR
was upregulated in patients with PSC and treatment with
UDCA decreased H2, H3, and H4HR (Fig. 3c). We found
increased serum histamine levels in PSC patients, whereas
UDCA-treated PSC patients had reduced histamine levels
(Fig. 3d).
UDCA feeding ameliorates biliary hyperplasia,
proliferation, hepatic fibrosis, inflammation, and
HSC activation in Mdr2−/− mice and human PSC
We found that Mdr2−/− mice fed UDCA have decreased
IBDM (Fig. 4a), biliary proliferation (Fig. 4b), and collagen
deposition/fibrosis (Fig. 5a, b) compared to Mdr2−/− mice
fed BAC. Bridging fibrosis was increased in the Mdr2−/−
mouse fed BAC compared to WT and this was not as
prominent in the Mdr2−/− mouse fed UDCA. Activation of
HSCs was determined by SYP-9 staining and we found an
increase in qualitative SYP-9 expression in Mdr2−/− mice
fed BAC that was reduced in Mdr2−/− mice fed UDCA
(Fig. 5c). Further, the expression of collagen type-1a,
fibronectin-1 (Fig. 6a) and SYP-9 (Fig. 5c) significantly
decreased in Mdr2−/− mice fed UDCA.
Fig. 2 a Mast cell numbers are increased in Mdr2−/− mice fed BAC
compared to WT and UDCA feeding decreases the presence of mast
cells shown by immunohistochemistry for mMCP-1 (marked by red
arrows). Semiquantification demonstrates a significant increase in mast
cell number in Mdr2−/− mice fed BAC that is reduced in Mdr2−/−
mice fed UDCA. b By immunohistochemistry for tryptase there is an
infiltration of mast cells found surrounding bile ducts in PSC patients
treated with placebo compared to normal tissue that were void of mast
cells (data not shown). In PSC patients treated with UDCA there were
no visible mast cells surrounding the ducts. Images are 20×

found that bile duct mass (CK-19 staining, red arrows) and Ki-67
increased in Mdr2−/− mice fed BAC compared to WT mice, whereas
in Mdr2−/− mice fed UDCA, there was decreased bile duct mass (red
arrows) and a lower number of proliferating cholangiocytes (red
arrows). Data have been semi-quantified and are expressed as mean ±

secretion diminished in Mdr2−/− mice fed UDCA compared to BAC
fed Mdr2−/− mice. c In human patients with PSC, H1–H4HR
expression increased compared to controls and in PSC patients treated
with UDCA, there was a decrease in the expression of H2HR, H3HR,
and H4HR. d Histamine serum levels were increased in some patients
with PSC and levels were decreased in one patient treated with UDCA.

CD68 expression increased in Mdr2−/− mice fed BAC
compared to WT and Mdr2−/− mice fed UDCA had
decreased expression (Fig. 6b). TGF-β and TNF-α gene
expression increased in Mdr2−/− + BAC mice compared to
WT; and, when Mdr2−/− mice were fed UDCA, TGF-β and
TNF-α expression decreased (Fig. 6c, d). Finally, we found
that UDCA feeding decreased MMP-2, -3, and -9 in
Mdr2−/− mice compared to BAC feeding (Supplementary
Fig. 3A).
In human liver tissue fibronectin-1 expression increased
in patients with PSC compared to control. UDCA treatment
decreased this marker (Fig. 7a). Further, Masson’s tri￾chrome staining revealed increased collagen deposition in
PSC patients compared to control; that decreased in PSC
patients treated with UDCA (Fig. 7b).
UDCA acts on MCs and alters biliary proliferation
and HSC activation, in vitro
Cultured MCs express ASBT and FXRβ (Fig. 8a). When
MCs were treated with UDCA, histamine secretion sig￾nificantly decreased and treatment with SC-435 (blocks
ASBT) or gugglesterone (inhibits FXRβ) returned histamine
secretion to normal levels (Fig. 8b).
We found that UDCA decreased histamine secretion and
the expression of c-Kit, tryptase and chymase (Fig. 9a, b).
In contrast, treatment with TC, but not TLC increased the
expression of MC markers (Supplementary Fig. 4A).
Stimulation with basal-treated MCs induced biliary pro￾liferation, whereas when cholangiocytes were treated with
supernatant collected from MCs pretreated with UDCA
(Fig. 9c), biliary proliferation decreased (Fig. 9d). Similar to
cholangiocytes, fibronectin-1 decreased in HSCs stimulated
with UDCA-treated MC supernatants compared to MC
basal treatments (Fig. 6e). Further, in vitro, biliary inflam￾matory markers TNF-α, CCL-3, and IL-6 increased after
stimulation with MC supernatants (basal-treated) and were
reduced when cholangiocytes were stimulated with MC
supernatants pretreated with UDCA (Supplementary Fig. 5).
To demonstrate that MCs, cholangiocytes and HSCs
work synergistically during PSC, cultured hHSCs stimu￾lated with cholangiocyte supernatant from Mdr2−/− mice
fed BAC had increased TGF-β1, collagen type-1a and
fibronectin-1 expression compared to either basal or

treatment with WT cholangiocyte supernatants (Fig. 10a–c).
When hHSCs were stimulated with cholangiocyte super￾natants from Mdr2−/− mice fed UDCA, fibrotic markers
significantly decreased (Fig. 10a–c). Finally, in vitro UDCA
decreased MC expression of MMP-2, -3, and -9 and TNF-α
compared to basal treatment (Supplementary Fig. 3B and
C), whereas TC or TLC induced the expression of MMP-2,
but not MMP-3 or MMP-9 (Supplementary Fig. 4B).
Discussion
MCs infiltrate Mdr2−/− mice and human PSC; and, treat￾ment with UDCA decreases MC activation coupled with
reduced biliary damage, proliferation, inflammation and
hepatic fibrosis. Further, we found that UDCA reduces
histamine, TGF-β1 and inflammatory cytokine release from
MCs thus reducing PSC-associated liver injury. In vitro, we
found that MCs express specific bile acid transporters and
nuclear receptors and inhibition of these components
increases MC activity and subsequent histamine release.
Further, cholangiocytes induce a response in HSC activity
that can also be regulated by UDCA, in vitro.
We have previously reported that Mdr2−/− mice and late
stage PSC patients have increased MC numbers compared
to controls [5], and studies supporting our work show
increased MC number and activation in cholangiocarci￾noma, hepatocellular carcinoma, fatty liver disease and in
hepatitis [24–26]. UDCA also decreases inflammatory MC
number within gallbladders of patients with cholesterol￾induced gallstones [27]. Further, we found that, in normal
rats, TC and TLC increase MC number and in support of
our findings, a study found that TC activates ileal secretion
in WT mice via degranulation of MCs [28].
Alpini et al. [21] reported that, in BDL rats, UDCA
feeding decreased biliary mass, bile secretion, and cho￾langiocyte proliferation by activation of PKC-α. This was
further investigated in BDL-vagotomized rats demonstrat￾ing that both UDCA and its taurine conjugate, TUDCA
induced protective effects on the biliary tree via calcium￾induced signaling [29]. While these studies support the
concept that UDCA may reverse liver damage, Fickertt
et al. [16] described that UDCA feeding exacerbates hepatic
damage in Mdr2−/− mice; however, these studies were
performed in different aged mice (4 weeks of age) and there
was no evaluation of biliary damage. It is important to note
that we utilized 12 week old Mdr2−/− mice that display a
robust PSC phenotype when compared to earlier time points
[16].
Further, we found that UDCA decreases HSC activation,
TGF-β1 and TNF-α expression coupled with inhibition of
hepatic fibrosis. Our previous [5, 10] and current findings

fibrosis. In support of this, in rats with CCl4-induced liver
fibrosis, treatment with UDCA improved histopathological
scores, decreased tissue hydroxyproline and inhibited MMP
activation with overall amelioration of hepatic fibrosis [30].
Further, in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, UDCA was found
to be beneficial at repressing hepatic fibrosis and HSC
activation by counteracting intestinal barrier dysfunction
[31]. While the usage of UDCA for reducing fibrosis in PSC
has been controversial, UDCA is useful in PBC manage￾ment by decreasing inflammation and fibrosis [12]. Further,
the derivative of UDCA, nor-UDCA, shows promising
results in both animals and humans to reduce and ameliorate
fibrosis in PSC and PBC [1, 2].
MCs release numerous inflammatory mediators includ￾ing histamine, TGF-β1 and TNF-α, all of which were
reduced in Mdr2−/− mice fed UDCA. During ulcerative
colitis there is an increase in inflammatory cytokines, that
are mostly ablated in MC-deficient rats [32]. Further, TNF￾α increases in lung tissues following autologous liver
transplantation; however, when animals were treated with
the MC stabilizers, cromolyn sodium, or ketotifen prior to
transplantation, inflammatory mediators significantly
reduced [33]. Additionally, BDL rats treated with UDCA
displayed a significant decrease in TGF-β1 expression
compared to control rats [34] and He et al. [35] found that
the addition of retinoic acid to UDCA treatment decreased
TGF-β1 and collagen deposition in BDL rats. The link
between UDCA and inflammation has also been demon￾strated in fatty liver disease. Pathil et al. [36] found that

min had decreased histamine secretion compared to basal treatments. b
The expression of c-Kit, chymase, and tryptase decreased in mast cells
treated with UDCA (40 μM, 120 min) shown by real-time PCR. c Mast
cells were treated with 0.1% BSA (basal) or UDCA (40 μM, 120 min)
and conditioned medium was collected. Cholangiocytes and HSCs
were treated with conditioned medium and biliary proliferation and
activation were measured. d In cholangiocytes treated with mast cell
conditioned medium (basal) there was an increase in cholangiocyte
proliferation shown by BrDU staining, whereas cholangiocyte
proliferation decreased following treatment with conditioned medium
from mast cells treated with UDCA. e HSCs stimulated with condi￾tioned medium from basal-treated mast cells had increased expression
of fibronectin-1, which was decreased in HSCs treated with condi￾tioned medium from mast cells treated with UDCA. Data are

treatment with a conjugate of UDCA improved liver his￾tology, steatosis and decreased proinflammatory cytokines
in mice fed a high fat diet. In our study, we found that
UDCA decreased MMP expression. Similar to this, it has
been previously demonstrated that UDCA induced bene￾ficial effects on liver ALT levels and inhibited MMPs
leading to the destruction of extracellular matrix in the
damaged liver [14].

Fig. 11 Working model depicting a summary of the findings. Mdr2−/−
mice fed BAC have upregulated mast cell number, HDC/HA/HR-axis,
biliary hyperplasia, HSC activation, fibrosis, inflammation and serum
TBAs. These parameters are all reduced in Mdr2−/− mice fed UDCA.
Further, patients treated with UDCA have decreased mast cell number,
inhibited HA/HR axis, HSC activation and fibrosis and inflammation
compared to placebo-treated patients. Finally, in vitro, UDCA acts on
mast cells to decrease biliary proliferation and HSC activation

Cholangiocytes express FXRβ and ASBT [37]. Simi￾larly, we found that MCs express these components (along
with others, data not shown) and may use these to allow
UDCA (or other bile acids) to induce effects on MC
degranulation. Whereas, UDCA has been demonstrated to
be a weak ligand for FXR in some studies [38], in our
work, we found that blocking FXRβ restored MC￾histamine release (inhibited by UDCA treatment) sug￾gesting that, in MCs, the UDCA/FXR interaction is
important. Further, Mueller et al. [39] recently reported that
UDCA exerts FXR antagonistic effects on patients with
NAFLD. ASBT is a critical regulator of conjugated bile
acids especially in cholangiocyte regulation [40, 41] and
we demonstrated that inhibition of ASBT or FXR returns
histamine levels back to normal following UDCA treat￾ment. In support of our studies, it has been previously
demonstrated that bile acids influence MC degranulation
[42] and we found that UDCA decreases MC-histamine
release, MC marker expression, biliary proliferation, and
HSC activation, in vitro. Interestingly, a recent study has
shown that the ASBT inhibitor itself may be a promising
tool for reducing PSC progression and clinical trials are
underway [43]. In this work the authors find that treatment
with SC-435 decreases inflammation, damage and fibrosis
in the Mdr2−/− mouse model, which are interesting since
we found that blocking ASBT returns histamine levels
back to normal following UDCA treatment, in vitro.
Considering that the authors used in vivo models and our
studies on the ASBT inhibitor were in vitro, more experi￾mental analysis should be performed to fully understand if
ASBT alters MCs during disease progression.
In conclusion, our studies are the first to demonstrate that
UDCA decreases MC number and histamine release,
thereby inhibiting PSC-induced inflammation. Our novel
data suggest an alternative strategy for UDCA action that
also includes regulation of MC function (Fig. 11). Further
studies are warranted to fully understand the implications of
bile acid regulation on MC activation including determining
the effects of nor UDCA, which has been shown to be a
promising therapy for PSC patients [44].
