There were no obvious differences between the primigravidae and
multigravidae, and no apparent association between success and the duration
of pregnancy or estimated time since fetal death. Four out of six patients
with a missed abortion whose uterine size was below 14 weeks underwent
suction evacuation 24 hours after treatment, abortion having failed to occur.
All patients were well controlled with the analgesic used; only one needed
three injections, while most of those with uterine size below 29 weeks
needed none or one injection immediately before abortion. Four patients
vomited, two of whom had diarrhoea, and all were given 15 mg PGE2. No
other side effects were observed. There were no complications. Surgical
evacuation was performed on six patients, and one retained placenta was
removed manually. Four patients lost over 500 ml blood, and one required
transfusion. No patient was feverish, and none developed consumption
coagulopathy.
Conclusions
The results with vaginal PGE2 gel were comparable with those
obtained in this unit with extra-amniotic administration,2 31 patients
(62" ,) having aborted or delivered without further uterine stimula￾tion; in the remainder the oxytocin infusion generally rendered
expulsion of the conceptus inevitable within a few hours. The vaginal
route, however, is simpler than the intrauterine and avoids the risk of
sepsis without reducing therapeutic efficacy. Physical and emotional
distress were minimal, 11 patients not requiring analgesia and only
four suffering any gastrointestinal side effects. Abortion and delivery
times compared favourably with those of Southern et al,4 who used
repeated administration of 20 mg PGE2 vaginal pessaries, which
provoked diarrhoea in 42 7°o and vomiting in 56-4°o.
The 15 mg dose of PGE2 used for a uterine size below 29 weeks
seems appropriate; a larger dose, although possibly reducing the
need for oxytocin, would probably provoke more side effects. Success
was reduced when uterine size was 11-13 weeks; however, suction
evacuation was then easily performed and seems reasonable treatment
when the uterus is this small and the cervix already softened and
dilated. In more advanced pregnancies the larger dose to reduce the
need for oxytocin might be inappropriate. Violent labour in the
presence of a dead fetus incurs the risk of amniotic fluid embolism,
and any great increase in dosage might therefore be imprudent.
We thank Sister Anna Fry and Sister Sue Bradley for expert nursing
care, and the medical staff of the John Radcliffe Hospital for referring
patients.

Hyperparathyroidism-a reversible
cause of cimetidine-resistant gastric
hypersecretion
Cimetidine has been successfully employed in the long-term treatment
of gastrinoma.1-4 We report the case of a patient in whom changing
parathyroid function appeared to effect the course of acid-peptic
disease and the response to the drug.
Case report
A 55-year-old woman developed hyperparathyroidism in 1953. She did
well after parathyroidectomy (3 1/2 glands). In 1974 she developed Zollinger￾Ellison syndrome and a non-5 islet cell tumour was excised from her
pancreas (tail) without return of the serum gastrin concentration or gastric
hypersecretion to normal. During 1975 her serum calcium concentration rose
to 3-5-4-3 mmol/l (14-17 mg/100 ml) and parathyroid tissue was excised from
her mediastinum. Multiple pieces of parathyroid tissue were implanted into
the left forearm in November 1975. In February 1976 dyspepsia and diarrhoea
led to her admission to hospital. She had multiple peptic ulcers and watery
diarrhoea (3 1/day). Her fasting serum gastrin concentration was 550 ng/l
(normal < 150 ng/l) and basal acid output (BAO) was 50-60 mEq/h. Her
serum calcium concentration was normal (2.3 mmol/l (9 mg/100 ml).
Cimetidine (300 mg) by mouth reduced BAO to less than 10 mEq/h from the
second to the fifth hour after the dose3 (fig A). She was discharged taking
cimetidine 300 mg six-hourly. Six months later diarrhoea recurred. The
serum calcium concentration was 2 5 mmol/l (10.2 mg/100 ml). From
October 1976 to February 1977 her serum calcium concentration fluctuated
between 2-2 and 2 9 mmol/l (8 8 and 11-6 mg/100 ml). In June 1977

antecubital veins showed on the left 86 [egll and on the right 0 41 ttg/l
(normal <0 22 ,tgll), a highly significant difference. These figures established
the diagnosis of systemic hyperparathyroidism and the presence of
functioning tissue in the left arm. By July 1977, because of dyspepsia and
diarrhoea, the dose of cimetidine was increased from 1-2 to 1 8 g/day. In
October 1977 her BAO was reassessed 48 h after stopping cimetidine.4 The
effect of the drug on BAO was then recorded (fig B). Compared with
February 1976 the BAO had increased by about 50 o . Cimetidine (300 mg)
by mouth continued to cause an absolute reduction in BAO, quantitatively
similar to that achieved previously, but in the postdrug period acid secretion
greatly exceeded that measured 18 months earlier. Serum gastrin con￾centration at this time was 800-950 ng/l, and during the test the serum
calcium concentration was 2-7 mmol/l (11 mg/ 100 ml). The identifiable
parathyroid tissue was then excised from her left forearm and the serum
calcium concentration fell. On the fourth postoperative day the response to
cimetidine (300 mg) was again measured (fig C). At this time the serum
calcium concentration was 2-3 mmol/l and the serum gastrin concentration
had risen to 2400 ng/l. In spite of the hypergastrinaemia the BAO and drug
responses had returned to those of February 1976. Cimetidine 300 mg four
times a day abolished diarrhoea and dyspepsia.
Comment
This patient seemed to be "escaping from control" with cimetidine.
Development of hyperparathyroidism and hypercalcaemia was
accompanied by a sharp rise in BAO. Surgery, which corrected the
hypercalcaemia, rapidly reduced BAO to the initial level and abolished
symptoms. The absolute response to cimetidine did not change much
over the 18-month period, but the BAO rose by 50% when the
serum calcium and PTH concentrations rose. Since BAO is the
result of a number of stimuli, such as acetylcholine, histamine, and
gastrin, the increase in BAO, not blocked by cimetidine, may have
been mediated by a stimulus other than histamine.5 Altered response
to cimetidine may be important in hyperparathyroidism. Conversely,
patients with ulcer who deteriorate on cimetidine merit investigation
of their parathyroid state.

Anterior synovial rupture of ankle
joint presenting as deep venous
thrombosis
Posterior synovial rupture of the knee joint with resultant oedema and
swelling in the calf closely resembles deep venous thrombosis.' This
occurs most commonly in patients with rheumatoid arthritis but
occasionally in other forms of arthritis.1 2 We report a case of mono￾arthritis of the ankle joint presenting with acute swelling of the ankle
and calf due to anterior synovial rupture mimicking deep venous
thrombosis.
Case report
A 27-year-old woman presented to the casualty department with a
three-day history of painful swelling of the left ankle and calf. Deep crural
venous thrombosis was diagnosed, but closer questioning disclosed a three￾month history of intermittent painful swelling of the ankle after minor
trauma. Three days before admission the ankle had become hot, painful, and
swollen but she had continued to walk, though with difficulty, and the
swelling and pain had spread to the whole leg below the knee. Examination
confirmed swelling of the calf and ankle but with maximum tenderness
around the ankle joint, which was warm. Minimal calf tenderness was noted,
and there was pain in the calf on dorsiflexion of the foot (Homans's sign).
No other abnormalities were found apart from mild genu recurvatum.
After a period of bed rest the calf swelling had diminished considerably
and a fluctuant cystic swelling 5 cm in diameter could be palpated above and
anterior to the ankle joint; from this 20 ml of straw-coloured fluid was
aspirated, which contained 12 x 109 cells/l (12 000/mm3), mainly neutrophils,
but no crystals. Culture was negative. Synoviography of the ankle joint
showed a communication between the joint and the swelling but not into
the calf, with only minor leakage of contrast material (figure). We considered
that the calf swelling and pain were secondary to the release of some irritant
synovial fluid into the tissues of the leg consequent to joint rupture, the
rest of this fluid forming the cystic swelling. No localised swelling had been
previously noticed by the patient. Phlebography was not considered necessary
in view of the rapid clinical improvement.
Other investigations showed haemoglobin 12-1 g/dl; white cell count
7 x 1091/ (7000/mm3); plasma viscosity 1-70 cp; and urate concentration
0-31 mmol/l (5-2 mg/100 ml) (normal 0-09-0-36 mmol/l; 1-5-6-0 mg/100 ml).
An RA latex test was negative and antinuclear antibodies absent. An x-ray
film of the ankle showed a short segment of'periosteal reaction at the medial
aspect of the lower tibia; sacroiliac joints were normal. HLA antigens Al
and 32 and B8 and 15 were present.
Comment
Synovial rupture in inflammatory arthritis causes the release of
irritant synovial contents resulting in pain and swelling.' When the
knee joint is affected the resulting clinical picture closely resembles
Synoviogram of left ankle joint showing immediate com￾munication with synovial cyst.
that of deep venous thrombosis and is not uncommon in patients with
early rheumatoid arthritis.' Other joints may also rupture, including
the wrist, elbow, shoulder, and hip, but rupture of the ankle joint is
rare.3 Baker first reported a case of a large synovial cyst anterior to the
ankle joint causing swelling in 1885.4 Synoviography of the ankle
joint in rheumatoid arthritis has shown synovial outpouches and
connections with tendon sheaths but no large anterior cysts or
rupture.'
Studies of pressure in the knee joint show that enormous rises
occur during normal use when an effusion is present,' which are
highest in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. High pressures might
be expected in other weight-bearing joints such as the ankle, and it is
surprising that rupture is so rare.
We are unaware of any report of synovial rupture of the ankle joint
causing the degree of pain and swelling seen in this case and also
of such rupture occurring so early in a monoarthritis. Anterior
synovial -rupture of the ankle joint must be considered in the
differential diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis.
We wish to thank Dr A St J Dixon, consultant rheumatologist, for
permission to report this case.
