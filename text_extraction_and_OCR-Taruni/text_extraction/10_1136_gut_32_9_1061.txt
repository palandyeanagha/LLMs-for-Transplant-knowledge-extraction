Ursodeoxycholic acid in chronic liver disease
J S de Caestecker, R P Jazrawi, M L Petroni, T C Northfield
Abstract
The hydrophilic bile acid ursodeoxycholic
acid has recently been shown to reduce
biochemical markers of both cholestasis
and hepatoceliular damage in patients with
chronic liver diseases. The most compelling
evidence available is for chronic cholestatic
liver diseases, in particular primary biliary
cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, and
cholestasis associated with cystic fibrosis. The
effects may be less beneficial in patients with
advanced liver disease from these conditions.
Data from placebo controlled trials are now
available in support of earlier uncontrolled
observations, but it is not yet clear whether
short term benefit results in an improvement in
longterm prognosis. The mechanism of action
of the compound seems to reside in its dis￾placement oftoxic hydrophobic bile acids from
both the bile acid pool and hepatocellular
membranes. There may be an independent
effect on bile flow, which could be ofparticular
importance in cystic fibrosis, and possibly an
effect on the immune system. Ursodeoxy￾cholic acid should now be regarded as occupy￾ing a central place in the medical management
of chronic cholestatic liver diseases, in
particular primary biliary cirrhosis, because it
improves cholestasis and reduces hepato￾cellular damage and it is not toxic. Research
should now be targeted on whether treatment
with ursodeoxycholic acid, initiated early in
cholestatic liver conditions, improves the long￾term outcome.

The bile acid ursodeoxycholic acid occurs
naturally in small quantities in human bile (<4%
of total bile acids). It is formed by 7-,B epimerisa￾tion of the primary bile acid chenodeoxycholic
acid through the action of intestinal bacteria. It
was first isolated earlier this century from the bile
of the Chinese black bear, after which species it
was named.' Nearly 40 years ago it was manufac￾tured synthetically in Japan, finding use as a
treatment for a wide range of liver diseases. Its
popularity stemmed not from rigorous scientific
study but from a longstanding tradition of the
beneficial properties of black bear bile ('Yutan').'
More general interest in the compound was
aroused 15 years ago when Japanese investi￾gators reported that ursodeoxycholic acid
desaturated bile and dissolved cholesterol gall
stones. 2
Leuschner and colleagues were the first to
report in an English language journal improve￾ment in liver function tests in patients with liver
disease.3 As a chance finding, they observed this
improvement in a group of patients with chronic
liver disease who were receiving ursodeoxycholic
acid to dissolve gall stones. This report stimu￾lated interest in the compound as a treatment for
a variety of adult and childhood liver disorders,
principally those resulting in cholestasis. The
result has been a large number of uncontrolled
studies, with the preliminary results of control￾led studies now beginning to emerge. This
review attempts to place in perspective the role of
ursodeoxycholic acid in the treatment of liver
disease, with discussion of recent data on its
mechanism of action. The aim will be to con￾clude what implications arise for current clinical
practice and future research.
Clinical studies
PRIMARY BILIARY CIRRHOSIS
Primary biliary cirrhosis is an example of a
disease in which two different processes may be
injuring the liver.4 One is the immunological
injury to intrahepatic bile ducts by mechanisms
which are still poorly understood.5 Most drugs
that have been evaluated for treatment of
primary biliary cirrhosis have been used in an
attempt either to influence this abnormal
immunological response or to inhibit the fibrosis
consequent on chronic inflammatory damage.
Although some, such as colchicine, cyclosporin,
and methotrexate seem promising and are still
being evaluated, use of others such as penicilla￾mine and prednisolone has now been
abandoned.56
The second mechanism, possibly a conse￾quence of the first, .is the retention of hydro￾phobic endogenous bile acids, including
chenodeoxycholic, deoxycholic, and lithocholic
acids (see Figure). These are damaging to cellu￾lar membranes, such as the bile canalicular
membrane7 and may thus aggravate the
cholestasis.'4 Fisher and Paradine were the first
to report a beneficial effect of ursodeoxycholic
acid in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis,8
followed by Poupon and colleagues in a report
published in the Lancet and attracting much
interest.9 The latter group observed in an open
study improvement in both symptoms and
serum enzyme markers of cholestasis with
ursodeoxycholic acid given over a two year
treatment period, with subsequent deterioration
when it was discontinued. Several uncontrolled
studies have confirmed these original observa￾tions,""'4 but all have been small studies with
fewer than 20 patients. Nevertheless, there has
been a striking uniformity in these reports of
improvement in symptoms and serum transa￾minases as well as alkaline phosphatase and y
glutamyltransferase. All enzyme levels were
reported decreased to 30-70% of pretreatment
values. Glutamine dehydrogenase, a hepatocyte
mitochondrial enzyme and a specific indicator of
hepatocyte damage, is also decreased.'5 Thus,
serum enzyme markers of both cholestasis and
hepatocellular damage are reduced on treatment.

These encouraging results are now being con￾firmed in controlled studies,5-2 including three
large multicentre studies.'7202' The results from
four trials'5 16 1821 giving sufficient information
are summarised in the Table. These include the
two which have appeared as full papers and two
abstracts. Only in the two full papers'5 21 iS
sufficient information supplied to determine that
the active and placebo groups are well matched
(Table). Some of the reports are based on interim
analysis at an interval of six months'7202' and
others are only short term studies, though one
has given results after two years of treatment.'6
Although in some of the open studies symptoms
were reported to improve during ursodeoxy￾cholic acid treatment, several of the controlled
studies have found that symptoms such as
pruritus and fatigue, though reduced, are
diminished to the same extent with ursodeoxy￾cholic acid as with placebo.'5 17 21 The maximum
reduction in serum biochemical parameters
occurs during the first year of treatment. 16
Hadziyannis and colleagues found that, particu￾larly in patients with stages III and IV of the
disease, biochemical and symptomatic deteriora￾tion occurred during the second year of treat￾ment.'6 This complements other uncontrolled
observations that patients with late stage disease
either respond poorly or may even deteriorate on
ursodeoxycholic acid.2:3 Serum IgM decreases
during treatment,5 9-21 hinting at an effect of
ursodeoxycholic acid on the immune process,
although no changes in antimitochondrial anti￾body titre have been observed in these reports.
Finally, histological improvement in liver biopsy
specimens has been reported in four studies,
notably a reduction in inflammation, bile
ductular proliferation, and epithelial cell pro￾liferation (Table).'5 18 19 21
OTHER CHOLESTATIC LIVER DISEASES
Ursodeoxycholic acid treatment has been tried in
a variety of other liver conditions. Symptoms
and serum enzyme markers of cholestasis and
hepatocellular damage in primary sclerosing
cholangitis have been shown to improve in both
open24 25 and controlled studies.26 Inevitably,
numbers have been small in these studies
because the disease is rare. In the cholestatic liver
disease associated with cystic fibrosis, average
reductions in alanine transaminase of 60% and
alkaline phosphatase of 47% were observed after
six months of treatment with ursodeoxycholic
acid in an open study.27 This study also reported
an improvement in nutritional state on treatment
despite a lack of effect on steatorrhoea. The
improvement in transaminases in this condition
has been confirmed in a placebo controlled
trial.28 In patients undergoing surgery for
obstructive jaundice, a randomised trial of
ursodeoxycholic acid administration before
surgery did not show any benefit in terms of
endotoxaemia, renal failure, or postoperative
morbidity and mortality.29 A short term (three
months) controlled trial in children suffering
from a variety of cholestatic liver diseases was
reported to benefit neither symptoms nor
biochemical parameters.30
There are reports suggesting that ursodeoxy￾cholic acid may be administered with benefit to
children who have had biliary reconstructions

Ursodeoxycholic acid in chronic liver disease
for biliary atresia.3'II- These patients suffer from
recurrent cholangitis, and it has been found that
ursodeoxycholic acid may in some cases improve
bile flow,33 reduce episodes of cholangitis,34 and
result in improved weight gain."'3 Anecdotal
reports suggest a benefit of ursodeoxycholic acid
in cholestasis of pregnancy35 and benign
recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis.36
CHRONIC HEPATITIS
Ursodeoxycholic acid has also been observed
to reduce transaminase levels in patients with
chronic hepatitis.3 4 Two double blind control￾led trials have been reported: one, comprising 59
blood donors with raised alanine transaminase,
found a significant reduction in alanine trans￾aminase with ursodeoxycholic acid, with rever￾sion to baseline levels when treatment was
stopped.37 The other study found no benefit of
serum enzymes or liver histology in patients with
non-A non-B chronic hepatitis (85% had anti￾bodies to hepatitis C virus) followed up for one
year.38 This was a small trial (20 patients),
however, and large spontaneous fluctuations in
alanine transaminase are characteristic of such
patients.
Mechanisms of action of ursodeoxycholic acid
It is clear from the results of clinical studies that
ursodeoxycholic acid results in improvement of
enzyme markers reflecting hepatocellular necro￾sis as well as cholestasis. It is more hydrophilic
than the endogenous bile acids chenodeoxy￾cholic acid and deoxycholic acid, though
whether it is more hydrophilic than cholic acid is
debatable.2 It is less surface active than the more
hydrophobic bile acids2 and thus has less
tendency to partition into membranes and to
solubilise membrane lipids.394 Consequently, it
is less toxic to a variety of cells studied in vitro,
including mast cells,39 red blood cells,4' and
isolated hepatocytes.4243 The most hydrophobic
bile acids, as expected, are the most toxic.
Furthermore, ursodeoxycholic acid protects
against the cytotoxic effects of other hydro￾phobic bile acids both in vitro and in vivo4"3 by
stabilising the cell membrane into which bile
acids seem to be incorporated.'5
The effects of bile acids in intact animals have
been elegantly shown in a series of experiments
from Kitani's group,'6 who found that
infusions of hydrophobic salts in increasing
concentrations produced an initial choleresis
followed by profound cholestasis indicated by a
fall in bile flow and bile acid secretion rate.
Coadministration of ursodeoxycholic acid,
however, inhibited cholestasis even when a
hydrophobic bile acid was infused at high rates.
The same group observed that ursodeoxycholic
acid prevented biliary leakage of lactate dehydro￾genase and albumin induced by hydrophobic
bile acids in the rat, indicating that damage to
bile duct epithelium was being prevented.4 This
protective effect is still seen if the concentration
of ursodeoxycholic acid is a quarter that of the
hydrophobic bile salt, suggesting it is not simply
due to dilution of the more toxic bile sale.'
Prevention of cholestasis may simply be a result
of the more general membrane protecting effect
of ursodeoxycholic acid (discussed above)
exerted on the bile canalicular membrane.
Indeed, it protects artificial membranes only if
they are rich in cholesterol,4" as is the case for the
bile canalicular membrane.
Erlinger and Dumont have shown that uncon￾jugated ursodeoxycholic acid is capable of pro￾ducing a bicarbonate rich hypercholeresis,48
which could be the result of either cholehepatic
recycling of protonated ursodeoxycholic acid4 or
direct stimulation of hepatocyte bicarbonate
transport. '48 Unconjugated ursodeoxycholic
acid might be excreted by the hepatocyte when
supraphysiological doses have been given so that
the glycine/taurine conjugation mechanisms are
saturated. The fact that no increase in unconju￾gated ursodeoxycholic acid is found in duodenal
bile of patients treated with this compound49
does not contradict this hypothesis, since chole￾hepatic recycling does not require the unconju￾gated bile acid to appear in the final bile.48
What relevance does this have to human liver
disease? In primary biliary cirrhosis serum con￾centrations of hydrophobic bile acids, including
toxic atypical bile acids, are increased.5I'53
Administration of ursodeoxycholic acid results
in enrichment of the bile acid pool at the expense
of endogenous hydrophobic bile acids. The
mechanism probably involves competitive
inhibition of active terminal ileal transport
of conjugates of endogenous bile acids by
ursodeoxycholic acid conjugates, thus enhancing
faecal excretion of the former.4 It seems likely
that this is an important component of the
mechanism of action of ursodeoxycholic acid in
human liver disease, since cirrhotic patients with
primary biliary cirrhosis, who, as observed pre￾viously, respond poorly to ursodeoxycholic acid
treatment, do not show the expected decrease in
endogenous bile acids."3 The additional
protective effects seen in animal and in vitro
experiments contribute to the efficacy of
ursodeoxycholic acid. In this respect there is
emerging evidence that treatment results in more
rapid hepatic transit and biliary excretion of
endogenous bile acids in primary biliary
cirrhosis, as assessed by hepatic handling of the
taurocholate analogue selenium homocholic acid
taurine (75SeHCAT).54 The proposed mechan￾isms of action of ursodeoxycholic acid are
summarised in the Figure.
With regard to the hypercholeresis induced by
ursodeoxycholic acid, it has been suggested that
this could prevent sludging of bile in fine biliary
radicles.4 This mechanism might be particularly
important in patients with cholestatic liver
disease associated with cystic fibrosis in whom
bile ducts are plugged by viscid mucus. Interest￾ingly, it seems that much higher doses are
necessary for an effect in this condition than in
other cholestatic diseases.275 Some other effects
of ursodeoxycholic acid may be relevant clini￾cally. Thus it is known that hepatobiliary trans￾port of organic anions such as bilirubin is
enhanced by most bile acids,' which may explain
why many clinical trials have found a reduction
in serum bilirubin in patients with primary
biliary cirrhosis when on ursodeoxycholic
acid treatment (Table). Too heavy a load of

ursodeoxycholic *acid in severely jaundiced
patients may have the opposite effect, possibly
by non-competitive inhibition of hepatic
uptake.' This may in part explain the reduced
efficacy of the compound in late stage primary
biliary cirrhosis.
Finally, some intriguing work has suggested
that ursodeoxycholic acid might have another
completely different mechanism of action. It is
known that in cholestasis there is an increased
expression of HLA class
I antigens on hepato￾cytes and class II antigens on biliary epithelium.
Class II antigens are targets for cytotoxic
T cell
damage.56 Class
I antigen expression probably
also plays
a part in cell mediated cytotoxicity.
Calmus and his coworkers have found that
aberrant class
I expression on hepatocytes is
reduced by ursodeoxycholic acid treatment, and
they speculate that this might lead to
a reduction
in piecemeal necrosis.57 Thus there may be an
additional benefit from ursodeoxycholic acid
in reducing immunological injury in primary
biliary cirrhosis.
Conclusions and speculations
CURRENT CLINICAL ROLE OF URSODEOXYCHOLIC
ACID IN LIVER DISEASE
Ursodeoxycholic acid should now be regarded as
having
a central role in the medical management
of cholestatic liver diseases, in particular primary
biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis,
neonatal biliary atresia, and liver disease associ￾ated with cystic fibrosis. The reasons for this are
the strong evidence that ursodeoxycholic acid
improves cholestasis and reduces hepatocellular
damage in these conditions; the lack of adverse
effects of the compound; and the absence of
alternative treatments combining efficacy with
lack of adverse effects. The longterm effects on
liver histology and prognosis are not yet known,
but the available evidence suggests that histology
may improve with ursodeoxycholic acid.
Caution should be exercised in patients in late
stage primary biliary cirrhosis (stages III and
IV). The dosage of ursodeoxycholic acid should
be around 10 mg/kg/day for primary biliary
cirrhosis and sclerosing cholangitis,"8 though
higher doses may be appropriate in cystic
fibrosis.27 In chronic active hepatitis available
evidence does not presently support
a clinical
role for ursodeoxycholic acid, though it remains
to be determined whether
a subsidiary role exists
in conjunction with established treatments.
FUTURE RESEARCH
The results of large multicentre trials of
ursodeoxycholic acid currently in progress will
be needed before it is known whether liver
histology is improved in patients with primary
biliary cirrhosis. Longer term controlled studies
will then be necessary to determine if the short
term effect is maintained and whether there is an
effect on prognosis. These could be mounted
once the current trials are completed (assuming
a
beneficial effect in the medium term is con￾firmed). It seems reasonable to surmise that a
beneficial effect on prognosis would be to pro￾long the asymptomatic phase of the disease
rather than arrest it, slowing progress towards
cirrhosis and liver failure. Indeed, recent work
shows that, contrary to previously held beliefs,
asymptomatic primary biliary cirrhosis is associ￾ated with a reduction in life expectancy.59
Because of this, and being mindful of the long
experience of the use of ursodeoxycholic acid in
gall stone disease suggesting
a lack of adverse
effects, early treatment might be advocated to
achieve the maximum impact. This would also
be the period in which any effect on reduction of
immunological injury would be most produc￾tive. Therefore it should not be unethical to
mount longer term studies in asymptomatic
patients. Given the different mechanisms which
are thought to produce liver injury in primary
biliary cirrhosis, it may also be appropriate to
consider combining
a drug specifically targeted
at the immune system with ursodeoxycholic acid
in future trials.
Other cholestatic liver diseases, in particular
those associated with primary sclerosing
cholangitis and cystic fibrosis, are at present
virtually untreatable, so large multicentre con￾trolled trials are urgently needed. Since these
diseases share
a common feature with primary
biliary cirrhosis, namely accumulation of toxic
hydrophobic bile acids, it is not unreasonable to
hope that ursodeoxycholic acid treatment will be
beneficial. It will be interesting to discover
whether hypercholeresis has any relevance to
clinical efficacy, particularly in cystic fibrosis. It
would be useful to know whether ursodeoxy￾cholic acid is of value in chronic hepatitis when
given in combination with interferon alfa.
The emergence of ursodeoxycholic acid as
a
promising new treatment in
a variety of chronic
liver diseases is not only
a hopeful development
for clinical practice but also provides
a stimulus
to further research into the underlying mecha￾nisms of liver damage in cholestasis. The next
few years should provide some exciting new
insights, together with detailed clarification of
the clinical role, applications, and mechanisms
of action of the compound. 1 Kitani K. Hepatoprotective effect of ursodeoxycholic acid in
