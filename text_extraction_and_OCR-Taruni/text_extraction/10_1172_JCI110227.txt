A B S T R A C T We have previously reported that
mannitol strikingly increases blood flow to rat kidnevs
hypoperfused at 35-40 mm Hg. This vasodilator effect
is not due to volume expansion or alterations in plasma
osmolality. We have tested the hypothesis that the vaso￾dilatory effect of mannitol in the ischemic rat kidney
is mediated by one of the vasoactive renal hormone
systems: renin-angiotensin, kallikrein-kinin, or prosta￾glandins.
Rats were infused with 5% mannitol in 0.9% saline
to 3-5% of body weight. In agreement with our pre￾vious studies, RBF increased 1.3+0.1 ml/min despite
maintenance of perfusion pressure at 35-40 mm Hg.
The cyclooxygenase inhibitors, meclofenamate and
indomethacin had no effect on renal blood flow (RBF)
in hypoperfused kidneys. However, in rats pretreated
with these inhibitors, expansion with mannitol in￾creased RBF by only 0.37+0.02 ml/min, 28% of the re￾sponse in the untreated group (P < 0.001). Infusion
of prostacyclin (PGI2) into the renal artery during
reduced perfusion resulted in an increase in RBF of
1.0+0.1 ml/min. Subsequent expansion with mannitol
increased RBF by only 0.5±0.1 ml/min more, less than
one-half of the effect of mannitol in a concurrent
group of rats not treated with PGI2.
Unlike PGI2, prostaglandin E2 had only a minimal
vasodilator effect during hyperperfusion. Imidazole, an
inhibitor of thromboxane synthesis, did not alter RBF
or renal vascular resistance during hypoperfusion.
Treatment of rats during hypoperfusion with the
angiotensin-converting enzyme (kininase II) inhibitor
teprotide increased RBF by 1.1±0.3 ml/min. However,

teprotide did not alter the vascular response to man￾nitol: RBF increased 1.2+0.1 ml/min more when man￾nitol was infused into teprotide-treated rats.
The renal vascular response to mannitol was not
altered by treatment with aprotinin, an inhibitor of the
kallikrein-kinin system. Aprotinin was ineffective
whether given before or after the vascular response
to manniitol was established.
We conclude that the vasodilator response to man￾nitol in the ischemic rat kidney is mediated in large part
by increased prostaglandin (PGI2) activity. The failure
of converting enzyme inhibition and aprotinin to block
the vasodilator response to mannitol is evidence
against a role for the renin-angiotensin or kallikrein￾kinin systems in mediating the vasodilator response.
INTRODUCTION
Mannitol has been widely used to prevent and treat
experimental and clinical acute renal failure. The
mechanisms by which it may exert a beneficial effect
are uncertain. We have been studying this problem
in the hypoperfused rat kidney, a model of "prerenal
failure." This model seems especially suitable for
determining the possible value of mannitol in prevent￾ing the development of acute renal failure in the
ischemic kidney. In our previous study (1), we found
that expansion with mannitol elevated renal blood flow
(RBF)l and reduced renal vascular resistance (RVR)
in the rat kidney perfused at a fixed pressure of 35-40
mm Hg, principally by reducing afferent arteriolar
resistance. This effect correlated closely with restora￾tion of glomerular filtration, which is absent in this
model prior to treatment with mannitol (1, 2). The
specific mechanism by which mannitol reduces RVR is

unclear from these studies. However, since comparable
expansion with isotonic saline failed to reduce RVR,
the effect of mannitol appears to be independent of
the influence of volume expansion per se. Since
isotonic mannitol also reduced RVR, changes in extra￾cellular fluid osmolality, likewise, are not necessary
to elicit a change in RVR.
The kidney contains three potent vasoactive hor￾mone systems which appear to be important in con￾trol of renal function under a variety of physiologic
conditions (3-9): the renin-angiotensin system, the
kallikrein-kinin system, and the prostaglandins (PG).
The purpose of the present study was to determine
whether the vascular response of the hypoperfused
kidney to expansion with mannitol was mediated by
these vasoactive hormone systems. We have found that
a substantial fraction ofthe effect ofmannitol on RVR in
the hypoperfused kidney is mediated by increased PG
activity. In contrast, neither the renin-angiotensin nor
kallikrein-kinin systems appear to be importantly in￾volved in the mechanism by which mannitol vaso￾dilates the hypoperfused kidney.
METHODS
Male Charles River (Charles River Breeding Laboratories,
Wilmington, Mass.) CD rats, weighing 200-350 g, were
anesthetized intraperitoneally with Ketamine HC1 (100
mg/kg, Parke, Davis & Co., Detroit, Mich.) and Inactin (25
mg/kg, Byk Gulden, Konstanz, West Germany). Supplemental
doses of Inactin were given as needed. Body temperature
was maintained between 370 and 38°C. During the control
period, saline was continuously infused at 0.04 ml/min through
a catheter placed in the jugular vein. Renal perfusion pres￾sure (RPP) was monitored by means of a catheter placed in the
left femoral artery and connected to a strain gauge transducer
and recorder. The left renal artery was exposed through a
suprapubic incision and dissected free from its attachments
to the renal vein. Blood flow through the left renal artery
was measured continuously with an electromagnetic flow
probe (EP model 401.5) connected to a square-wave electro￾magnetic flowmeter (model 501, Carolina Medical Electronics,
King, N. C.). Validation of this technique has been previously
described (1).
After base-line measurements of RPP and RBF were
obtained, RPP was reduced to 35-40 mm Hg by means of
a clamp placed around the descending aorta, 5-10 mm above
both renal arteries. Since we have previously found that urine
flow is negligible during this hypoperfusion period (1, 2),
saline infusion was terminated to prevent excessive volume
expansion. After 30-45 min of hypoperfusion, the animals
were volume expanded with 5% mannitol in 0.9% NaCl (MS).
Perfusion pressure was maintained at 35-40 mm Hg. A
volume equal to 3-5% body weight was given in 10-15 min,
followed by a continuous infusion of MS at 0.1 ml/min.
To determine if the renal vascular effect of MS expan￾sion was mediated by increased renal PG synthesis, the
following experiments were performed. (a) Rats were treated
15 min before hypoperfusion with either of the cyclo￾oxygenase inhibitors, indomethacin or meclofenamate (10),
in a dose of 2 mg/kg, followed by a maintenance dose of 2
mg/kg per h. After 30 min of hypoperfusion the animals were
expanded with MS as described above. Since the vascular
response was similar in rats treated with indomethacin or
meclofenamate, the animals were subsequently considered as
one group, irrespective of which inhibitor they received. (b)
In a separate group of animals, we determined the effect of
indomethacin (2 mg/kg) on the renal vascular response to
expansion with MS at normal RPP. The protocol was identical
to the first study, except that aortic clamping was omitted. (c)
After 15 min ofhypoperfusion, prostacyclin (PGI2) was infused
through a glass micropipette into the renal artery in a dose of
0.3-0.45 ug/min. PGI2 was diluted in Tris buffer, pH 8.7, and
delivered at a rate of 0.01 ml/min. After an additional 30
min of hypoperfusion, the rats were volume expanded
with MS as described above. A control group of rats was
treated in a similar manner using Tris buffer alone. (d) We
also assessed the effect of PGE2 on renal vascular tone during
hypoperfusion. After 30 min of hypoperfusion, PGE2, 0.5
,ug/min, was infused into the renal artery, while RPP was
maintained at the reduced level. PGE2 was stored as a stock
solution of 10 mg/ml in 95% ethanol, and subsequently diluted
to desired concentrations with isotonic NaCl just prior to use.
To determine whether increased synthesis of thromboxanes
by the hypoperfused kidney altered its RVR, six additional
rats were treated with imidazole (Sigma Chemical Co., St.
Louis, Mo.), a specific inhibitor of thromboxane synthesis
(11). After 30 min of hypoperfusion, the rats were treated
with either a low (4-17 mg/kg per h) or high (185 mg/kg per
h) dose of the inhibitor dissolved in 0.9% NaCl and observa￾tions of RPP and RBF were made for the next 1-h period.
To determine if the MS effect was mediated by inhibition
of the renin-angiotensin system or stimulation of the kalli￾krein-kinin system, the following experiments were per￾formed. (a) After 30 min of hyperperfusion rats received 250
,ug of teprotide (SQ20881) intravenously. This substance
inhibits the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II,
and potentiates the kallikrein-kinin system by inhibiting
the catabolism of kinins (12). The same dose of teprotide was
repeated at 30-min intervals. 10 min after the first dose, the
animals were expanded with MS as described above. (b) Rats
were treated with aprotinin (Boehringer-Mannheim Bio￾chemicals, Indianapolis, Ind.) to inhibit kallikrein (13). A
priming dose of aprotinin in 0.9% NaCl equaling 15 x 103
kallikrein inhibitory units, was given 15 min before clamping
the aorta, followed by an intravenous maintenance infusion
of 150 kallikrein inhibitory units/min at a rate of 0.01 ml/min.
After 30 min of hypoperfusion, the rats were expanded with
MS as described above. In a second series, the rats were
treated with aprotinin after, rather than before, expansion with
MS. The effect of this treatment on renal hemodynamics was
assessed 30-40 min after the priming dose of aprotinin.
Time-control studies were performed in separate groups
of rats to evaluate the effect of continued hypoperfusion or
prolonged infusion of indomethacin, PGI2, teprotide, or
aprotinin. These experiments were conducted exactly as
above except that the rats were not expanded with MS.
Typically, three to five measurements ofRBF were made be￾fore, and a similar number 10-60 min after each of the
experimental manipulations described above. Observations
before and after each maneuver were averaged to obtain a
single value. Statistical probability in a group of animals each
treated with several agents-e.g., hypoperfusion, PGI2,
PGI2 plus MS-was determined by analysis of variance for
multiple treatments in a single animal (14). Where appropriate,
the means were tested by Student's t test for paired observa￾tions (14). One-way analysis of variance and Dunnett's t test
(15) were used to determine the significance of the difference
between the effect of the variance manipulations and that of
mannitol. A P < 0.05 was considered to be significant.

RESULTS
Renal hemodynamics were assessed in 40 rats at control
RPP and after 30-45 min ofhypoperfusion. When RPP
was reduced from 100±2 to 37±0.3 mm Hg, RBF fell
from 5.8±0.1 to 1.3±0.1 ml/min (P < 0.001), and RVR
rose from 17.4±0.4 to 30.4±1.6 mm Hg/ml per min (P
< 0.001). These changes are similar to those ofprevious
reports from our laboratory (1).
Table I, section A, summarizes the effect of inhibi￾tion of PG synthesis on the vascular response of the
hypoperfused kidney to expansion with MS. Treatment
with meclofenamate or indomethacin before hypo￾perfusion did not affect RBF during hypoperfusion.
RBF of the rats pretreated with these inhibitors was
1.4±0.1 ml/min, compared with 1.6±0.1 ml/min for non￾treated animals. Subsequent expansion with MS
increased RBF by only 0.37±0.02 ml/min in rats
treated with either of the inhibitors. This change
in RBF was significantly less than that caused by MS
in the control group of rats studied concurrently,
1.3±0.1 ml/min (P < 0.001, treated vs. nontreated).

RBF and RVR of the hypoperfused kidney remained
unchanged for 1 h during treatment with imidazole, a
specific inhibitor of the synthesis of thromboxanes,
which are potent vasoconstrictors. RBF after 30
min of hypoperfusion was 1.2±0.1 ml/min, and 1.3±0.2
ml/min after 1 h of imidazole infusion (n = 6). Cor￾responding values for RVR were 33.8±2.6 and 32.1±2.9
mm Hg/ml per min.
We also assessed the response of the renal vascula￾ture at normal perfusion pressure to expansion with MS
in indomethacin-treated and nontreated rats. (Table I,
section B). Expansion with MS resulted in an increase
in RBF of 1.2±0.5 ml/min, and a fall in RVR of 3.0±1.1
mm Hg ml per min in nontreated animals. In the indo￾methacin-treated animals, RBF rose 2.1±0.9 ml/min,
and RVR fell 3.4+1.4 mm Hg/ml per min. These
changes were not statistically different from those ob￾served in the nontreated group.
Table I, section C, summarizes the effect of infusion
of PGI2 on renal hemodynamics during hypoperfusion
and subsequent expansion with MS. Infusion of PGI2
into the renal artery after 15 min of hypoperfusion
increased RBF by 1.0±0.1 ml/min (P < 0.005). This
effect of PGI2 was not significantly different from that
caused by expansion with MS, 1.3+±0.1 ml/min, in a sep￾arate, concurrent series of rats. Subsequent expansion
with MS increased RBF by only 0.5±0.1 ml/min in rats
pretreated with PGI2. This additional effect of MS was
significantly less than its effect in the concurrent series
of rats not treated with indomethacin (P < 0.001). Infu￾sion of Tris buffer (the vehicle for PGI2) alone had
no effect on RBF or on the response to expansion
with MS (n = 5).
The left-hand bars of Fig. 1 compare the effects of
MS, PG inhibition, and PGI2 infusion on RBF in the
hypoperfused kidney. PG inhibition, although it had no
direct effect on RBF, decreased the renal vascular
response to MS expansion to -28% of the response in
nontreated rats. PGI2 increased RBF by nearly as much
as expansion with MS alone. The effect of subsequent

expansion with MS was significantly blunted by pre￾treatment with PGI2. The total vasodilatory effect of
PGI2 plus MS was not different from the effect of MS
expansion in nontreated rats.
We also assessed the response of the renal vascula￾ture to PGE2 infused into the renal artery during hypo￾perfusion (n = 5). PGE2 infusion increased RBF by
only 0.16+±0.05 ml/min. This change was significant
(P < 0.05), but was significantly less (P < 0.001) than
the increase in RBF caused by PGI2, 1.0±0.1 ml/min,
reported above.
Table II summarizes the effect of converting enzyme
(kininase II) inhibition on the hemodynamics of the
hypoperfused kidney, and on the response to sub￾sequent expansion with MS. In 18 rats, teprotide in￾creased RBF by 1.1±0.3 ml/min (P < 0.001). Sub￾sequent expansion with MS resulted in a further
increase in RBF of 1.2±0.1 ml/min (Fig. 1), a value
not significantly different from the effect of mannitol
alone (see Table I). As shown in the two right-hand
bars of Fig. 1, the combined effect of teprotide and MS
expansion was additive and significantly greater than
that of MS expansion alone (P < 0.001). Despite
maintenance of a greatly reduced RPP, the combined
vasodilator effect of these two agents increased RBF to
3.4±0.1 ml/min (Table II). This is 2.5 times the usual
value for RBF at RPP of 40 mm Hg, and 57% of the RBF
at normal RPP in the anesthetized rat (Table I).
Table III summarizes the effect of aprotinin treat￾ment on the renal vascular response to expansion with
MS. Aprotinin had no direct effect on RBF during
hypoperfusion; compare the RBF of 1.4±0.1 ml/min in
part A of the table to that for hypoperfusion alone,
1.5±0.1 ml/min, in part B. After treatment with apro￾tinin, MS expansion increased RBF by 0.91±0.09 ml/
min (Table III, A). This effect of MS was not different
from that of MS expansion in a concurrent series of four
rats not treated with aprotinin, 1.1±0.1 ml/min (Table
III, B). In addition, aprotinin, when given after the
vascular response to MS expansion was fully estab￾lished, did not reverse this effect (Table III, B).

The effect of time on RBF and RVR was observed in
rats undergoing hypoperfusion alone or during pro￾longed treatment with indomethacin, PGI2, teprotide,
or aprotinin. Continued hypoperfusion had no signif￾icant effect on RBF or RVR. After 30 min of hypoper￾fusion, RBF was 1.5+0.2 ml/min and RVR was 27.1+3.1
mm Hg/ml per min (n = 7). After 1.5-2 h of hypoper￾fusion, RBF was 1.3+0.2 ml/min and RVR was 29.3
±3.3 mm Hg/ml per min. Indomethacin had no effect
on RBF or RVR during the 1st h of infusion. RVR fell
slightly but significantly (P < 0.05) during the sub￾sequent 30-60-min period. RBF was 1.3+0.1 ml/min
5 min after beginning hypoperfusion, 1.6+0.2 ml/min
after 60 min, and 1.5+0.1 ml/min after 90-120 min.
RVR was 30.7±2.0 mm Hg/ml per min 5 min after
beginning hypoperfusion, 27.6±+3.3 mm Hg/ml per min
after 60 min, and 26.2+3.3 mm Hg/ml per min after
90-120 min (n = 4). PGI2 vasodilated the hypoper￾fused kidney during the 1st 30 min of infusion; there
was a tendency toward further reduction in RVR during
the subsequent 60-90 min, but this was not statistically
significant. RBF was 1.5+0.2 ml/min during hypoper￾fusion and rose to 2.3±0.1 ml/min after 30 min of PGI2
infusion (n = 4). Corresponding values for RVR were
33.7±5.3 mm Hg/ml per min and 17.8±+1.5 mm Hg/ml
per min. After a further 60-90 min of PGI2 infusion,
RBF was 3.1+0.4 ml/min and RVR was 13.8±1.9 mm
Hg/ml per min. There was a tendency for RBF to fall
and for RVR to rise throughout prolonged aprotinin
infusion. RBF was 1.7+0.1 ml/min after 30 min, 1.6
+0.1 ml/min after 60 min, and 1.4+0.1 ml/min after
90-120 min (n = 4). Corresponding RVR was 24.0
+2.0 mm Hg/ml per min, 24.1+2.3 mm Hg/ml per min,
and 30.1 ± 1.6 mm Hg/ml per min. Finally, in four rats
treated with teprotide, RBF and RVR did not change
between 30 and 120 min after treatment was begun.

RBF was 2.2±0.4 ml/min after 30 min and 2.4±0.6 ml/
min after 90-120 min. Corresponding values for RVR
were 17.0±2.0 mm Hg/ml per min and 16.7±3.2 mm
Hg/ml per min.
DISCUSSION
As in our previous study (1), volume expansion with
MS resulted in a significant elevation in RBF and
reduction in RVR in rat kidneys perfused at a fixed
pressure of 35-40 mm Hg. When rats were treated with
either indomethacin or meclofenamate to block PG
synthesis, the vascular response to expansion with MS
was significantly reduced. Moreover, the response
to MS expansion was greatly blunted when kidneys
were initially vasodilated by infusion of PGI2 (Table I).
In contrast, the vascular effect of MS expansion was not
altered by manipulation of the renin-angiotensin or
kallikrein-kinin systems. Teprotide (SQ20881) blocks
the renal vasoconstrictor effect ofthe renin-angiotensin
system by inhibiting conversion of angiotensin I to
angiotensin II. It potentiates the vasodilator effect of
the kallikrein-kinin system by inhibiting degradation
of kinins (12). Teprotide failed to alter the vascular
response to MS expansion even though this substance
when given alone increased RBF nearly as much as
expansion with MS (Table II, Fig. 1).2 In animals
treated with the kallikrein inhibitor aprotinin, to block
kinin production, MS expansion increased RBF to the
same extent as in nontreated animals (Table III).
From these observations, we concluded that the hemo￾dynamic response of the hypoperfused kidney to MS
expansion is mediated principally by stimulation of PG
synthesis. Stimulation of kinin production and inhibi￾tion of angiotensin II do not appear to be important
mechanisms in the vascular response of the hypo￾perfused kidney to MS expansion.
PGI2 infusion during hypoperfusion resulted in a sig￾nificant elevation in RBF, while vasodilation in
response to PGE2, although statistically significant, was
minimal. PGI2 has been shown to be the major end￾product of arachidonic acid metabolism in vascular
tissues (18), and a more potent vasodilator than PGE2
in rats and rabbits (8, 9). In fact, some investigators
have found that PGE2 causes vasoconstriction in rats
and rabbits (9, 19, 20). In addition, Whorton et al. (21)
2 Recent observations in rabbits (16) and man (17) suggest
that an increase in PG may mediate part of the vasodilatory
effect of converting enzyme inhibitors. It is possible that in￾creased PG activity may account for part of the vasodilator ef￾fect of teprotide in our experiments. However, the failure of
prior teprotide treatment to attenuate vasodilation by mannitol
argues against this. Teprotide may not stimulate PG in the
hypoperfused rat kidney or it may increase only PGE2, which
is not an effective renal vasodilator.
and Fitzpatrick et al. (22) have shown that PGI2 is made
by the renal cortex and may account for most ofthe renal
vasodilator effects of arachidonic acid metabolism in
dog and rabbit. Whereas PGE2 failed to cause vaso￾constriction in our studies, the renal vasculature of the
hypoperfused kidney appeared to be much less sensi￾tive to infusion of PGE2 than PGI2. These observa￾tions suggest that PGI2, rather than PGE2, is probably
the specific PG mediating the vasodilatory effect of MS
expansion.
We also considered the possibility that MS expansion
might be causing renal vasodilation by inhibiting the
production of thromboxanes, end-products of arachi￾donic acid metabolism with vasoconstrictor properties
(23, 24). This possibility seems unlikely, however,
because treatment with imidazole, which blocks throm￾boxane production, did not result in vasodilation of the
hypoperfused kidney.
A possible alternative explanation of our data is that
mannitol enhances the vascular responsiveness to
PG, which are elevated because of hypoperfusion.
Support for this interpretation comes from the observa￾tion that PGE-like material in the renal vein of the dog
is increased by hypoperfusion (25-27). Under these
conditions in the dog, inhibition of cyclooxygenase
markedly increases RVR (26-28). The failure of cyclo￾oxygenase inhibitors to increase RVR in our experi￾ments (Table I, A) argues against a high level of PG
activity in the rat kidney perfused at 40 mm Hg. These
observations agree with those of other investigators
(9, 29), who report that cyclooxygenase inhibition has
no effect on RVR in the rat at normal or moderately
reduced RPP. Nevertheless, the possibility that PG are
elevated in the ischemic rat kidney and that mannitol
acts, not by stimulating production, but by overcoming
vascular resistance to these hormones, can only be
ruled out by direct measurement of PGI2 production.
We were unable to directly measure PGI2 production
in this study. PGI2 itself is very unstable, and its
metabolism is usually monitored by measurement of its
more stable byproducts. In the rat, as many as seven
metabolites of PGI2 are produced, the major ones being
diketo derivatives (30, 31). Hence, although our data
strongly suggest that mannitol stimulates PGI2
synthesis or release in the hypoperfused kidney, they
are not unequivocal proof.
The fact that the vascular response to MS expansion
was not completely eliminated by inhibition of PG
synthesis or by prior administration of PGI2 may be
explained by one of several possibilities. First,
Zambraski and Dunn (32) have recently demonstrated
that meclofenamate and indomethacin to not block PG
synthesis completely. Doses ofthese inhibitors, similar
to those used in this study, inhibited secretion and
excretion of PGE2 by only 65-86%. This is one likely
explanation for the observation that these inhibitors

blocked only -70% of the vascular effect of MS expan￾sion in our studies. Second, our time-control studies
indicate a tendency for modest further vasodilation
during prolonged infusion of PGI2 and cyclooxygenase
inhibitors. It is possible, therefore, that part of the
residual response to MS in rats treated with these
agents was actually the effect of extended infusions of
the agents rather than a response to MS itself. Third,
a small portion of the vasodilatory effect of MS expan￾sion may be mediated by non-PG mechanisms. It has
been previously suggested that changes in viscosity
and hematocrit following MS expansion could account
for a small part of the increase in RBF (2, 33). It is
possible that the small increase in RBF that occurred
in response to MS expansion during blockade of PG
synthesis was the result of such a change in the
physical properties of the blood. Fourth, there might
be some minimum value for RVR at an RPP of 40
mm Hg. It might be argued, in the case of PGI2
infusion, that the initial vasodilation caused by this PG
may have limited the vascular response to mannitol, not
because of an interaction with the PG, but simply
because the absolute physical limit for vasodilation had
been reached. The results of the experiments with
teprotide indicate that this is probably not the case.
Initial vasodilation with this agent did not prevent full
expression of the vasodilator effect of mannitol. Thus,
the effect of PGI2 is specific, rather than a more
generalized response which would be true of any
vasodilator.
We were interested in determining whether the PG
system might mediate the vasodilator effect of MS
expansion on the renal vasculature at normal RPP. RBF
rose and RVR fell -20% in the normally perfused rat
kidney in response to our standard MS expansion
(Table I). Blockade of PG synthesis failed to reduce
the response to MS expansion. This suggests that en￾hanced PG synthesis is probably not an important part
of the mechanism by which mannitol can vasodilate
the kidney at normal RPP. It is worth emphasizing
that the vascular response of severely hypoperfused
kidney to vasoactive agents other than mannitol also
may differ significantly from that of the normally
perfused kidney. Kinins, acetylcholine, papaverine (1),
and furosemide (unpublished data), all potent dilators
at normal RPP, are ineffective in the hypoperfused
kidney.
In summary, we conclude that the renal vascular
response to MS expansion during hypoperfusion is
mediated, in large part, by an interaction with the renal
PG system. The likeliest explanation is that increased
PGI2 activity mediates this vasodilator response.
Studies in other laboratories have provided evidence
that treatment with either mannitol (1, 2) or PG (34)
may decrease renal insufficiency in a number of models
of acute renal failure. Our results suggest that both
agents may act, in part, by common vascular mechanisms
under those circumstances as well as in the hypo￾perfused kidney.
