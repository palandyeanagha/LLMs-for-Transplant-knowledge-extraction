Abstract
Background: Laboratory research and previous study suggest that aliskiren, a direct renin inhibitor, has anti-proteinuric
effects. We conducted a randomized crossover study to evaluate the anti-proteinuric effect of aliskiren in patients with
immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy.
Methods: We studied 22 patients with biopsy-proven IgA nephropathy and persistent proteinuria despite angiotensin
converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). Patients were randomized to either oral aliskiren
300 mg/day or placebo for 16 weeks and then crossed over to the other treatment arm after a washout period. Proteinuria,
estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), blood pressure, and serum potassium were monitored.
Results: After aliskiren treatment, there was a significant reduction in proteinuria in 4 weeks (1.7660.95 to 1.0360.69 g:g-Cr,
p,0.0001), which remained at a low level throughout the treatment period. There was a significant difference in proteinuria
between the aliskiren and placebo groups from 4 to 16 weeks after treatment (p,0.01 for all comparisons). After aliskiren
treatment, there were modest but statistically significant reductions in eGFR (57.2629.1 to 54.8629.3 ml/min/1.73 m2
,
p = 0.013) and diastolic blood pressure (72.6612.3 to 66.2611.2 mmHg, p,0.0001). None of the patient developed severe
hyperkalemia (serum potassium $6.0 mmol/l) during the study period.
Conclusions: Aliskiren has anti-proteinuric effect in patients with IgA nephropathy and persistent proteinuria despite ACE
inhibitor or ARB. Further studies are needed to confirm the renal protecting effect of direct renin inhibition in chronic
proteinuric kidney diseases.

Introduction
Immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy is the most common type
of primary glomerulonephritis worldwide [1]. It causes end stage
renal disease in 15 to 20% of individuals within 10 years of onset
[2], and in 30 to 35% of individuals within 20 years of onset.
Proteinuria, an elevated serum creatinine concentration, hyper￾tension, and advanced, chronic disease in kidney biopsy predict
progression [2,3].
The optimal therapy of IgA nephropathy remains unknown.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin
receptor blockers (ARB) reduce proteinuria in short-term trials [4–
7] and retard the rate of progression of renal function
deterioration in chronic, proteinuric nephropathy [7,8]. However,
ACE inhibitor and ARB may not accomplish enough among high￾risk patients because there exist bypass mechanisms and inhibition
of the renin-angiotensin axis (RAS) is usually incomplete [9].
Renin inhibition is a new option to block the RAS at the first
rate-limiting step. Preliminary data suggest a more complete
suppression of the intra-renal RAAS with direct renin inhibition
as compared with ARBs and ACE inhibitors [10]. Renin
inhibition with aliskiren lowers blood pressure in hypertensive
patients [11,12]. There is early evidence that direct renin
inhibitors may also have anti-proteinuric effect. In nondiabetic
hypertensive patients, renin inhibition with remikiren leads to
albuminuria reduction [13]. Recently, Persson et al [14] showed
that aliskiren, the only direct renin inhibitor on the market,
reduced 24-hour blood pressure, and this was associated with a
reduction in albuminuria in type 2 diabetic patients. However,
the efficacy of direct renin inhibitor for the treatment of non￾PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 May 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 5 | e62736

diabetic chronic proteinuric kidney diseases has not been
evaluated. The primary objective of the present study is to
evaluate the safety and short-term efficacy of aliskiren, a direct
renin inhibitor, on proteinuria reduction in patients with IgA
nephropathy.
Patients and Methods
The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist
are available as supporting information (see Figure S1, Checklist
S1 and Protocol S1). The study was approved by our local clinical
research ethics committee (Joint Chinese University of Hong
Kong-New Territories East Cluster Clinical Research Ethics
Committee). The study procedure was performed according to the
Declaration of Helsinki. Written consent was obtained from all
subjects.
Patient Selection
This is a randomized placebo-controlled cross-over study. We
recruited 22 patients with biopsy-proven IgA nephropathy from
January 2010 to June 2011. Inclusion criteria were adult patients
(aged 18 to 65 years) with renal biopsy-confirmed diagnosis of IgA
nephropathy and require anti-hypertensive therapy, proteinuria
.1 g/day (or proteinuria .1 g/g-Cr) in 3 consecutive samples
despite ACE inhibitor or ARB treatment for at least 3 months,
estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) .30 ml/min/
1.73 m2
, and willingness to give written consent and comply with
the study protocol. Renal biopsy specimens were assessed by a
validated disease damage index [15] as well as the Oxford
classification [16,17]. We excluded patients who are diabetic,
patients with systemic diseases that may cause IgA nephropathy or
another nephropathy.
Treatment Regimen
After informed consent, each patient was randomized to
receive either oral aliskiren 300 mg/day or placebo for 16
weeks, followed by a washout period of 4 weeks, and then
crossed over to either placebo or aliskiren for another 16 weeks
(Figure 1). The appearance, packaging and labelling of the study
medication and placebo were identical. Individuals were
randomised by a computer-generated list, which was used for
packaging of the study item and then maintained by a third
party that was not involved in the conduction of the study.
Marked drug packs (35 capsules for each 4 week supply) were
designated for each patient. During follow up visits, study drug
was dispensed by a dedicated research nurse. Both patients and
investigators were blinded from the treatment allocation. Results
of biochemical tests were completed before the randomisation
code was broken at the end of the study.
Follow Up Visits
Follow up visits took place at week –4 (screening), 0, 2, 4, 8, 12,
16, 20, 22, 24, 28, 32, 36 and 40 (final visit). During every visit, the
following parameters were measured: body weight, blood pressure,
pulse, adverse effects of treatment, complete blood picture,
differential white cell count, renal function test, liver enzymes,
serum calcium, phosphate, and early morning urine collection for
protein-to-creatinine ratio. Renal function was determined by the
estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) according to a
standardized formula validated in Chinese [18]. Serum fasting
glucose and lipid profile were measured at 0 and 16 weeks. Prior to
enrolment, all patients were taking a stable dose of ACE inhibitor
or ARB. Anti-hypertensive therapy was titrated throughout the
study period to maintain the blood pressure below 130/
80 mmHg.
Other Laboratory Tests
At week 0, 4, 16, 20, 24 and 36, serum level of TGF-b1 and
plasma renin activity (PRA) were also measured. Patients were
instructed to rest in a supine position in a quiet room for 30
minutes before each blood draw. The sample was separated within
20 minutes, and the plasma was then stored at –80uC before
transport, on dry ice, to the laboratory for assay. Serum TGF-b1
levels were quantified by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) kit from the R&D Systems, Inc. (Minneapolis, MN), with
a detection limit of 31.2 pg/ml. PRA was measured by a
radioimmunological microassay based on angiotensin I trapping
by antibody [19]. The inter- and intra-assay coefficients of the
PRA assay were between 5% and 9%.
End Points
Primary end point of the study is the change in proteinuria.
Average proteinuria level at –4 and 0 week was taken as the
baseline. Secondary end points include the change in eGFR and
blood pressure. Information about adverse event was also
recorded.
Statistical Analysis
The sample size is estimated by the Power Analysis and Sample
Size for Windows software (PASS 2000, NCSS, Kaysville, Utah).
A sample size of 57 would be needed to achieve 80% power to
detect a 20% reduction in proteinuria, with a significance level
(alpha) of 0.05, using a two-sided paired t-test. However, because
of the slow recruitment rate, only 22 patients were enrolled in the
designated recruitment period, with a statistical power of 39.3%
with the same assumptions.
Statistical analysis was performed by SPSS for Windows
software version 15.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). Data were
expressed in mean 6 SD. Data are compared by Chi-square test

or Student’s t-test as appropriate between groups. Correlations
between continuous variables were computed by the Pearson’s
correlation coefficient. Overall effect of the treatment was
determined by analysis of variance (ANOVA) for repeated
measures. Post hoc analysis for individual time point was
performed by paired Student’s t test with Bonferroni’s adjustment
for multiple comparisons. A p value of below 0.05 was considered
significant. All probabilities were two-tailed.
Results
We recruited 22 patients. The overall study design is
summarized in Figure 1. One patient withdrew consent before
treatment was actually started. The results of the remaining 21
patients are analyzed. Their baseline clinical characteristics are
summarized in Tables 1. There was no significant difference in the
histological grading between the groups (details not shown).
Amongst the 21 patients, 6 were taking lisinopril (18.367.5 mg/
day), 4 on ramipril (11.366.3 mg/day), 4 on losartan
(125.06119.0 mg/day), and 7 on valsartan (108.6650.1 mg/
day). All patients were advised on dietary sodium restriction
(sodium ,3 g/day); 9 patients also received diuretic therapy as
part of their anti-hypertensive regimen. None of the patient had
been treated with corticosteroid or fish oil.
Renal Response
After aliskiren treatment, there was a significant reduction in
proteinuria in 4 weeks (1.7660.95 to 1.0360.69 g:g-Cr,
p,0.0001), which remained at a low level throughout the
treatment period (Figure 2). In contrast, proteinuria was modestly
reduced after 4 weeks of placebo (1.7060.89 to 1.4760.97 g:g-Cr,
p = 0.049) and remained static. There was a significant difference
in proteinuria between the aliskiren and placebo groups from 4 to
16 weeks after treatment (p,0.01 for all comparisons).
After 2 weeks of aliskiren treatment, there was a modest but
statistically significant decline in eGFR (57.2629.1 to
54.8629.3 ml/min/1.73 m2
, p = 0.013) (Figure 3). The eGFR
then remained static throughout the treatment period. In contrast,
there was no significant change in eGFR throughout the period
treated with placebo (see Figure 3). At 8 weeks, the aliskiren group
had a slightly lower eGFR than the placebo group (53.6629.2 vs
58.0635.6 ml/min/1.73 m2
, p = 0.059), but the result did not
reach statistical significance. There was no significant correlation
between the change in eGFR and change in proteinuria (r = 0.252,
p = 0.3).
Effect on Blood Pressure
After 4 weeks of aliskiren treatment, there was a modest
reduction in systolic blood pressure (122.5617.5 to
118.1615.0 mmHg, p = 0.11) (Figure 4), but the difference did
not reach statistical significance. In contrast, there was no
significant change in systolic blood pressure throughout the period
treated with placebo (see Figure 4). Although the aliskiren group
had marginally lower systolic blood pressure than the placebo
group throughout the treatment period, the difference was not
statistically significant at any specific time point by post hoc
analysis (details not shown).
After aliskiren treatment, there was a significant reduction in
diastolic blood pressure in 2 weeks (72.6612.3 to
66.2611.2 mmHg, p,0.0001), which remained at that level
throughout the treatment period (Figure 4). In contrast, there was
no significant change in diastolic blood pressure throughout the
period treated with placebo. There was a significant difference in
diastolic blood pressure between the aliskiren and placebo groups
from 2 to 16 weeks after treatment (p,0.05 for all comparisons).
During aliskiren treatment, there was a modest but significant
correlation between the change in systolic blood pressure and
change in proteinuria (r = 0.491, p = 0.024). In contrast, the
change in diastolic blood pressure had no significant correlation
with the change in proteinuria (r = 0.387, p = 0.083). The change
in eGFR did not correlate with either systolic or diastolic blood
pressure (details not shown).
Other Biochemical Parameters
After 4 weeks of aliskiren treatment, there was a marked
reduction in plasma renin activity (5.5065.25 to 0.7660.73 ng/
ml/hr, p,0.0001), which remained at that level by 16 weeks
(Figure 5). In contrast, plasma renin activity remained static
throughout the period treated with placebo. Plasma renin activity
was significantly lower in the aliskiren group than the placebo
group at 4 and 16 weeks of treatment (p,0.001 for both
comparisons). The reduction in plasma renin activity during
aliskiren treatment did not correlate with the change in
proteinuria, eGFR, systolic or diastolic blood pressure (details
not shown).
During the study period, there was no significant change in
serum sodium level, liver enzymes, fasting glucose or lipid profile
(details not shown). There was also no significant change in serum
TGF-b level during the study period (details not shown).
Adverse Effects
The period of aliskiren treatment had a higher serum potassium
level than the placebo period at 2, 12 and 16 weeks (p,0.01 for all
comparisons). (Figure 6) During the period of aliskiren treatment,
4 patients had a total of 8 episodes of hyperkalemia; during the
period of placebo, 1 patient had one episode of hyperkalemia. All
responded to oral sodium bicarbonate and advise on low
potassium diet. None of the patient developed severe hyperkalemia
(serum potassium $6.0 mmol/l) during the study period.
In general, aliskiren was well tolerated. Three patients reported
dizziness, 2 during aliskiren treatment and 1 during the placebo
phase. Another patient from reported headache during aliskiren
treatment. None of the patients had severe adverse effect that
required hospital admission or discontinuation of the study
medicine.

Discussion
In the present study, we found that in patients with IgA
nephropathy and persistent proteinuria despite ACE inhibitor or
ARB therapy, aliskiren can effectively reduce proteinuria. Our
study indicates that, in additon to diabetic nephropathy, direct
renin inhibitor also has anti-proteinuric effect on non-diabetic
glomerular disease. In general, aliskiren is very well tolerated, and
its effects on blood pressure, renal function, and serum potassium
level are relatively modest.
The anti-proteinuric effect of aliskiren we observed is similar to
previous reports. For example, in an uncontrolled study on IgA
nephropathy, Tang et al [20] reported that after 14 weeks of
aliskiren treatment, proteinuria decreased from 1.73 to 1.27 g:g￾Figure 2. Serial change in proteinuria during the periods of aliskiren (closed circles) and placebo (open circles) treatment. Error bars

Cr. In patients with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy on losartan,
treatment with aliskiren for 12 months reduced the mean urinary
protein-to-creatinine ratio by 26.3% [21]. More recently, Chen
et al [22] also reported that add-on treatment of aliskiren reduced
proteinuria and attenuated the decline in renal function in non￾diabetic CKD patients who were receiving ARB. Although the
magnitude of proteinuria reduction seems consistent in all these, it
is interesting to note that proteinuria appears to be reduced within
4 weeks of treatment in the reports of Persson et al [14] as well as
our present study, while it takes 8 weeks in the report of Chen et al
[22], and 14 weeks in the study by Tang et al [20]. The reason of
this discrepancy is unknown.
In the present study, we observed that proteinuria also reduces
significantly during the period of placebo treatment, although the
degree of reduction was less as compared to the period during
aliskiren treatment. Our findings are in line with previous reports.
For example, Parving et al noted that in type 2 diabetic patients
with nephropathy, proteinuria was reduced by 50% or more in
12.5% of patients treated with placebo [21]. Previous studies on
diabetic nephropathy also showed that intensive care received by
patients in a clinical trial setting also reduced the rate of decline in
renal function, presumably by the optimization of all risk factors
[23].
We observe a modest but statistically significant reduction in
blood pressure during the period of aliskiren treatment. The
magnitude of blood pressure reduction is also consistent with
previous reports [20,21]. In theory, the anti-proteinuric effect of
aliskiren could be the result of its blood pressure lowering effect.
However, we found no correlation between the degree of blood
pressure reduction and the decrease in proteinuria. Previous
studies on diabetic nephropathy showed that the antiproteinuric
effects of aliskiren were independent of baseline blood pressure
[24]. Since this is a crossover study, it could be argued that the
anti-proteinuric effect during the phase of placebo treatment could
represent a carry-over effect of recent aliskiren treatment.
However, the anti-proteinuric effect during the phase of placebo
treatment was actually observed irrespective to the sequence of
treatment allocation (details not shown). Based on the result of a
previous study [14], a washout period of 4-weeks would be
sufficient and baseline proteinuria level could be re-established.

Contrary to two previous reports [20,25], we did not observe
any reduction in serum TGF-b level in response to aliskiren
treatment. It is interesting to note that our patients had much
lower pre-treatment serum TGF-b levels (around 16 pg/ml) than
those in Tang’s study (25 to 30 pg/ml) [20], suggesting some
difference in patient selection between the studies.
In the present study, hyperkalemia was uncommon and mild
during aliskiren treatment. It should, however, be noted that most
of our patients had stage 2 to 3 CKD, and the risk of hyperkalemia
should be considerably higher if the baseline renal function is
worse. Previous studies on diabetic nephropathy reported that
hyperkalemia developed in 22.5% of patients treated with aliskiren
[26]. A recent meta-analysis showed that aliskiren plus ACE
inhibitors or ARB increases risk for hyperkalemia more than
monotherapy with any of these agents [27].
We find that short term aliskiren treatment is well tolerated.
Currently the efficacy and safety of aliskiren is best tested in two
clinical trials in heart failure, namely, the Aliskiren Trial of
Minimizing OutcomeS for Patients with HEart failure (ATMO￾SPHERE) [28] and the Aliskiren Trial on Acute Heart Failure
Outcomes (ASTRONAUT) [29]. However, on 20 December
2011, the Aliskiren Trial In Type 2 Diabetes Using Cardio-Renal
Disease Endpoints (ALTITUDE) [30], was stopped on the
recommendation after the second interim efficacy analysis
[31,32]. In this study, aliskiren or placebo was randomly assigned
as an adjunct to an ACE inhibitor or ARB to type 2 diabetic
patients who are at high risk for cardiovascular and renal events.
Although the primary and secondary renal end points were similar
between the groups after a median follow-up of 32.9 months, and
the reduction in urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio was greater in
the aliskiren group, the proportions of patients with hyperkalemia
and hypotension were both significantly higher in the aliskiren
than the placebo group [32]. A similar problem has also been
reported by the ONTARGET study, which used dual blockade of
the renin-angiotensin system by combination therapy of ACE
inhibitor and ARB [33]. The long term safety and efficacy of
vigorous inhibition of the renin-angiotensin axis deserves further
studies.
There are a number of limitations of our study. The sample size
of the present study was small and we recruited patients, on
average, over 5 years after their renal biopsy. There was, as a
result, a possible selection bias that we enrolled patients with
persistent proteinuria but relatively stable function, while the
subgroup of IgA nephropathy patients with rapidly progressive
disease was not represented in our study population.
More importantly, the duration of study was short and the long
term efficacy of aliskiren in reducing proteinuria needs to be
confirmed. We observed a ‘‘rebound’’ in proteinuria soon after
aliskiren treatment was discontinued (see Figure 2). Because of the
short follow up and crossover design of our study, we cannot make
any conclusion on the effect of aliskiren on the rate of renal
function decline.
In summary, our study showed that aliskiren has anti￾proteinuric effect in patients with IgA nephropathy and persistent
proteinuria despite ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy. Further studies
are needed to confirm the renal protecting effect of direct renin
inhibition in chronic proteinuric kidney diseases.
