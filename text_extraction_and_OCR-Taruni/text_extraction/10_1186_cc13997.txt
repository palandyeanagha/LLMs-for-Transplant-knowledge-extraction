Abstract
Introduction: Circulatory failure during brain death organ donor resuscitation is a problem that compromises
recovery of organs. Combined administration of steroid, thyroxine and vasopressin has been proposed to optimize
the management of brain deceased donors before recovery of organs. However the single administration of
hydrocortisone has not been rigorously evaluated in any trial.
Methods: In this prospective multicenter cluster study, 259 subjects were included. Administration of low-dose
steroids composed the steroid group (n = 102).
Results: Although there were more patients in the steroid group who received norepinephrine before brain death
(80% vs. 66%: P = 0.03), mean dose of vasopressor administered after brain death was significantly lower than in the
control group (1.18 ± 0.92 mg/H vs. 1.49 ± 1.29 mg/H: P = 0.03), duration of vasopressor support use was shorter
(874 min vs. 1160 min: P < 0.0001) and norepinephrine weaning before aortic clamping was more frequent (33.8%
vs. 9.5%: P < 0.0001). Using a survival approach, probability of norepinephrine weaning was significantly different
between the two groups (P < 0.0001) with a probability of weaning 4.67 times higher in the steroid group than in
the control group (95% CI: 2.30 – 9.49).
Conclusions: Despite no observed benefits of the steroid administration on primary function recovery of
transplanted grafts, administration of glucocorticoids should be a part of the resuscitation management of
deceased donors with hemodynamic instability.
Introduction
Currently in France, increasing transplantation indica￾tions cannot be met because of graft shortage. It has
been proven that the amount of procured grafts can be
increased by an optimized management of brain-dead
patients [1-5]. Almost 80% of brain-dead patients exhibit
circulatory failure and it is commonly associated with
heart, lung, kidney, liver and pancreas dysfunction,
which compromises organ procurement in 10% to 25%
of cases [6]. Although circulatory failure is controlled in
more than 60% of brain-dead patients, primary function
recovery of the grafts, especially heart, liver and pancreas
grafts can be altered by increased vascular filling and ad￾ministered vasopressors [7-9].
Thyroid hormones and cortisol deficit have already
been identified as circulatory failure factors [10-12].
Thus, current British guidelines recommend giving thy￾roid hormones and corticosteroids to brain-dead pa￾tients with circulatory failure [13-15]. Several studies
showed an increased amount of procured grafts and less
primary dysfunction in transplanted heart grafts when
triple therapy with thyroid hormone, corticosteroids and
arginine vasopressin was used [6,16]. However, system￾atic triple therapy remains debated because these studies
are retrospective, whereas donor characteristics have
considerably evolved with time (mean age of included

patients in these studies is significantly inferior to the
mean age of present potential donors for example), be￾cause the groups are not comparable and because the re￾spective contribution of each agent of the triple therapy
administered remains controversial.
This prospective multicenter study aimed to demon￾strate that systemic administration of low-dose steroids
during resuscitation of brain-dead donors makes vaso￾pressor weaning possible in 25% of patients and also de￾creases by more than 15% the quantity of vasopressors
needed to control circulatory failure. It also aimed at
studying the impact of steroid administration on primary
function recovery of grafts and on the number of pro￾cured grafts compared to the amount of potential do￾nors who died with brain death.
Material and methods
The study was approved by the French human subject
protection committee (CPP OUEST III, number 061026),
which waived the need for written informed consent from
the family. In fact, French law entitles the conduct of ran￾domized studies among clinically deceased patients with￾out any informed consent from the family of the patient
concerned. The study was conducted in accordance with
the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinski as
well as the Declaration of Istanbul and in compliance with
French guidelines on organ procurement. The families of
the donors were informed of the study. The French
Registre National des Refus was consulted systematically
(mandatory in France) to eliminate any opposition of the
donor to participation in a clinical trial or organ donation.
The authors decided to conduct a prospective cluster
study involving 22 ICUs during 15 months to compare
two different resuscitation strategies: systematic hydrocor￾tisone supplementation (steroid group) or no supplemen￾tation (control group) in brain-dead patients who were
potential organ donors. Among the involved centers, 11
gave standard-care, low-dose hydrocortisone to brain￾dead patients before organ procurement and 11 did not
use that therapy. All the patients were treated in the same
way in a given center and all the centers introduced vaso￾pressor support on the same hemodynamic criteria so
minimizing the bias bound to the absence of randomiza￾tion and to the potential center effect.
Patients
All brain-dead patients, over 18 years old, hospitalized
in the involved centers and considered for organ pro￾curement were eligible for the study. Brain death was
determined according to the usual criteria of French law:
no motor response to nociceptive stimuli, no more brain
stem reflexes and no more spontaneous breathing,
which was confirmed with an apnea test when there
were no other confounding factors such as hypothermia,
collapsus and impregnation of the central nervous sys￾tem by depressant drugs. Patients were included once
the family has been informed about the study protocol.
Patients over 18 years old, who received corticosteroids
or had adrenal insufficiency before brain death, were ex￾cluded. Patients registered in Registre National des Refus
(in France, where refusals to donate organs are regis￾tered) were secondarily excluded from the study. Two
groups of equal numbers and patient ages could not be
obtained because of the illegality of randomization of
brain-dead patients in France and because of the cluster
distribution of recruited patients.
Hemodynamic evaluation
All patients were monitored through an artery catheter
and a central venous catheter in the superior vena cava.
Patients received controlled ventilation with a tidal vol￾ume (VT) of 7 to 10 ml/kg, positive end-expiratory pres￾sure (PEEP) of 0 to 5 cmH2O, and an adjusted rate to
maintain normocapnia. Hypotension was defined as
mean blood pressure <65 mmHg. Mean blood pressure
was set between 65 and 75 mmHg. The preload depend￾ence was evaluated with respiratory variation of pulse
blood pressure or with variation of subaortic doppler
speeds or echocardiography-measured vena cava diam￾eter; common threshold values previously defined in the
protocol were used [17]. Vascular filling was performed
with 500- to 1,000-ml aliquots of crystalloids adminis￾tered during 10 to 15 minutes. Norepinephrine therapy
was started if persistent hypotension and no preload de￾pendence criteria were noted. If the mean blood pres￾sure was superior to 85 mmHg, norepinephrine dose
was decreased until complete vasopressor weaning.
When diabetes insipidus (defined by diuresis >3 ml/
kg/h and urine density <1003 gm/cm3
) occurred, diur￾esis needed to be offset volume for volume and desmo￾pressin was administered to maintain diuresis between 1
and 3 ml/kg/h and natremia <160 mmol/L.
Study design
Administration of replacement dose of hydrocortisone
had to be started at a maximum 6 h after the diagnosis
of brain death. Adrenal stimulation by adrenocorticotro￾phic hormone (ACTH) (250 μg injection of tetracosactrin,
SynacthenR
; Novartis Pharma SAS, Rueil Malmaison,
France) was investigated. Adrenal insufficiency was de￾fined by plasma cortisol level inferior to 18 μg/dl at time
of injection (zero minutes, T0) and/or by a variation of
plasma cortisol level following ACTH injection (T60 to
T0) inferior to 9 μg/dl (so-called non-responding patients)
[18]. After ACTH injection, when plasma cortisol level
was superior to 9 μg/dl, patients were classed as respond￾ing. Patient then received a 50-mg injection of hydrocorti￾sone (Roussel-Uclaf, Romainville, France) followed by a
Pinsard et al. Critical Care 2014, 18:R158 Page 2 of 8
http://ccforum.com/content/18/4/R158

continuous infusion of 10 mg/h until the aortic clamping
was performed in the operating room during organ re￾trieval. Plasma cortisol assays were done before ACTH
injection (T0) and 60 minutes after injection (T60) by
electrogenerated chemiluminescence (Roche automat
modular). In the control group (patients did not receive
hydrocortisone), the physician in charge of the patient de￾cided whether or not to perform the ACTH test.
Appraisal criteria
The main appraisal criterion was the quantity of norepin￾ephrine weaning possible during resuscitation of brain￾dead donors, or the decrease of the quantity of vasopressors
needed to control circulatory failure. It was quantified with
the average dose per hour, the variation percentage and the
duration of administration of norepinephrine from the time
of inclusion into the study (when brain death was diag￾nosed) to the aortic clamping during organ procurement.
Secondary appraisal criteria were: number of recovered
organs compared with number of brain-dead donors
and with number of organs considered for procurement
when grafts were proposed to the Agence de la bioméde￾cine (French organization responsible for census of
brain-dead patients and for national distribution of
grafts). Another secondary criterion was the frequency
of delayed graft function (DGF) for each graft. For each
organ, DGF was determined from clinical and biological
data usually considered by French transplant physicians
(Table 1). Pancreas grafts were counted among recov￾ered organs but primary dysfunction analyses were not
studied since these organs were recovered for islets of
Langerhans transplantation and not for whole organ
transplantation. Finally, cold ischemia duration was reg￾istered for each recovered and transplanted organ.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using the SAS 9.2
software package (SAS Inc, Cary, NC, USA) and Stat￾view 5.0 software (SAS Institute, Berkeley, CA, USA).
Continuous variables were expressed as mean ± SD and
qualitative variables were expressed as absolute numbers
and percentages. Comparisons between the steroid group
and control group were performed using the Student t-test,
or Mann-Whitney U-test when appropriate for the quanti￾tative variables, and the chi-square test for the qualitative
variables. For paired donor-kidneys, comparison of DGF
between the two groups was adjusted for cold ischemia
duration, serum creatinine value, norepinephrine dose, and
simplified acute physiological score II (SAPSII), using lo￾gistic regression analysis with random effects to account
for impairment, performed using the PROC GLIMMIX
command in SAS. Kaplan-Meier curves were plotted to
describe the probability of norepinephrine weaning. Curves
were compared between groups using the log-rank test.
The corresponding hazard ratio (HR) was estimated using
a univariate Cox model. All statistical tests were two-sided
and were conducted using the 0.05 level of significance.
Results
During the study, 631 brain-dead patients were hospital￾ized in the 22 participating centers. Hemorrhage within
the brain or meninges represented 72% of the etiologies
of brain insult responsible for brain death (Table 2). Or￾gans were recovered from 304 patients (48%) and 259
donors (41%) were included in the study. Finally, 208
donors (33%) were analyzed: 128 brain-dead patients
were included in the control group and 80 in the steroid
group (Figure 1). The mean age of each group was simi￾lar but in the steroid group, the number of patients over
65 years old was significantly higher, with an initial se￾verity score represented by the highest SAPSII (Table 2).
The mean dose of hydrocortisone received in the steroid
group was 210 ± 35 mg.
The ACTH stimulation test was performed in the 80
patients in the steroid group and in 41 patients in the
control group; it revealed adrenal insufficiency in 94/121
brain-dead patients (78%). In the steroid group, the
mean time before administration of hydrocortisone was
168 ± 130 minutes after brain death diagnosis. The mean
quantity of hypotension episodes was comparable in
control group and steroid group (1.2 ± 1.4 versus 1.0 ±
1.6, P = 0.18). The mean vascular filling volume per hour
was similar in the two groups (179 ± 106 ml/h versus
219 ± 165 ml/h, P = 0.88). Although there were more pa￾tients in the steroid group who received norepinephrine
before brain death (80% versus 66%, P = 0.03), the mean
dose of vasopressor administered after brain death was
significantly lower than in the control group (1.18 ±
0.92 mg/h versus 1.49 ± 1.29 mg/h, P = 0.03), duration of
vasopressor support use was shorter than in control
group (874 minutes versus 1,160 minutes: P <0.0001)
and norepinephrine weaning before aortic clamping was
more frequent (33.8% versus 9.5%, P <0.0001) (Table 3).
Using a survival approach, probability of norepinephrine
weaning was significantly different between the two
groups (P <0.0001) with a probability of weaning 4.67

times higher in the steroid group than in the control
group (95% CI 2.30, 9.49) (Figure 2). For the sub-groups
of patients responding or non-responding to the ACTH
test, no significant differences in norepinephrine wean￾ing were noted (HR 1.84, 95% CI 0.67, 5.05, P = 0.23 and
HR 6.74, 95% CI 0.82, 55.19, P = 0.07, respectively).
The number of recovered organs compared to the
number of brain-dead patients was similar in the steroid
group and control group (3.31 ± 1.36 versus 3.51 ± 1.39,
P = 0.23) (Table 4). However, if compared to the number
of organs considered for procurement, the percentage of
recovered grafts in the steroid group was higher than in
control group, but it did not reach the significance
threshold (92% versus 88%, P = 0.07) (Table 4). There
was no significant difference in cold ischemia duration
between the two groups (Table 5).
Among the 714 recovered grafts, 72 grafts were not
transplanted (10.1%). Among the 642 transplanted and

studied grafts, we observed a DGF in one case out of
three (212/642). DGF of kidney graft was more frequent
in the steroid group (39% versus 28%, P = 0.03) (Table 6).
However this difference did not persist after adjustment
for the other variables: logistic regression with random
effects for donor showed that the probability of kidney
graft DGF increased with age of the donor (P = 0.0007),
and with serum creatinine value before procurement
(P = 0.006) and decreased with norepinephrine dose
(P = 0.03) but was not modified by the strategy (P = 0.26).
When SAPSII was considered in the model instead of age,
the only predictors of kidney graft DGF were serum
creatinine value (P = 0.04) and cold ischemia duration
(P = 0.01).
For the other grafts, DGF frequency was comparable
in both groups (Table 6).
Discussion
This multicenter prospective controlled study demon￾strates that systemic administration of low-dose steroids
during brain-death resuscitation of potential brain-dead
organ donors makes vasopressor weaning possible in
more than a third of patients (33.8%) and also decreases
by more than 20% the quantity of vasopressors needed
to control circulatory failure, allowing for a significant re￾duction in the need for inotropic support. This effect is
not related to adrenal insufficiency identified by ACTH
stimulation, but steroid administration alone fails to in￾crease the number of organ recovered for transplantation.
When an organ donor with brain-death is resuscitated,
one of the main objectives is to stabilize the hemo￾dynamic state in order to limit ischemia and inflamma￾tion as far as possible in the different organs. This goal
is usually achieved by a combination of fluid expansion
and inotrope administration. Norepinephrine is associ￾ated with a decreased rate of high-yield procurement
and it seems clinically relevant to reduce doses or use of
norepinephrine in brain-dead donors to increase the rate
of organ procurement. Thyroid hormones and cortisol
deficit have already been identified as circulatory failure
factors in brain-dead donors [10-12]. Our study confirms
that prescription of a replacement dose of hydrocorti￾sone during resuscitation of a potential brain-dead
donor makes vasopressor weaning possible and also de￾creases vasopressor doses, which are necessary to main￾tain a stable hemodynamic state in unweaned patients.
These results are in agreement with those of a single￾center observational cohort of 30 patients with brain
death who were administered 50 mg of hydrocortisone:
in 58% of patients norepinephrine doses were reduced
by 30% after three hours [19]. Another study compared
two groups of donors including during two consecutive
periods and studied the impact of high doses of methyl￾prednisolone (15 mg/kg) versus low doses of hydrocorti￾sone (300 to 500 mg): frequency of vasopressor weaning
was 39% in the first group and 47% in the second group,
with no significant difference between both groups [20].
Our results for hemodynamic stability and decrease in
vasopressor use following steroid administration are
similar to the results obtained in several studies, in
which identical doses of hydrocortisone were adminis￾tered in patients who were not brain-dead [21,22].

Although in our study, adrenal insufficiency frequency
(77.6%) was similar to the results of both studies cited
above [19,20], no significant difference was noted in the
frequency of vasopressor weaning of brain-dead patients
compared to plasma cortisol level at baseline or to initial
response to ACTH stimulation. Our results did not con￾firm those of Nicolas-Robin et al. [19], who suggested
that steroid administration would be more beneficial in
patients with documented adrenal insufficiency. How￾ever our results are consistent with other studies con￾ducted in different settings, such as in septic shock,
showing that the ACTH stimulation test had no predict￾ive value for hemodynamic response of patients receiv￾ing corticosteroids [23-26].
Several reports suggest that multimodal hormonal
therapy (thyroid hormone, corticosteroids and arginine
vasopressin) might have beneficial effects on recovery of
organs, with an increased amount of procured grafts and
less primary dysfunction in transplanted heart grafts
[6,16]; however, the respective contribution of each hor￾monal therapy remains controversial. Thyroid hormone
administration by itself has been considered either to be
beneficial, neutral or to have no significant impact on
organ procurement. In our study, no significant difference
was noted in the number of recovered organs per donor
in either group. The number of recovered organs com￾pared to the number of organs considered for procure￾ment was slightly higher in the steroid group than in the
control group, but the difference was not significant. DGF
frequency was similar in both groups regardless of the
grafted organ. Kidney grafts were the only exception with
primary dysfunction significantly more frequent in the
steroid group. Despite the benefits of a replacement dose
of hydrocortisone on vasopressor consumption, our study
did not demonstrate any benefits of steroid administration
for primary function recovery of transplanted grafts. Some
studies have either shown the absence of clinical impact of
a replacement dose of hydrocortisone on primary function
recovery of kidney [27], liver [28], heart and lung grafts;
for those grafts, only a decrease in systemic inflammatory
markers and their expression in tissue, and a decrease of
extravascular lung water accumulation were beneficial for
primary graft recovery [29,30].
Our study has several limitations: lack of randomiza￾tion of brain-dead patients, cluster distribution of re￾cruited patients, lack of data about receivers’ history,
and comorbidities of receivers and their consequences
for DGF. This might have limited our capacity to iden￾tify some potential beneficial effects of steroid adminis￾tration during brain-dead donor resuscitation and we
expect that practitioners would not change their usual
practice in brain-dead donor resuscitation.
Conclusion
Early substitutive administration of glucocorticoids in a
potential brain-dead organ donor with circulatory failure
makes it possible to significantly reduce the cumulative
dose and administration duration of vasopressors. What￾ever the case, based on our results we cannot reach a
conclusion as to whether or not the routine use of

steroids administration in potential brain-dead organ do￾nors should be supported, independently of documented
relative adrenal insufficiency, and no benefits for primary
function recovery of transplanted grafts were observed
in the study. Existing controversy in the literature sug￾gests that a multiple strategy is required to achieve
measurable effects in the standard care of organ donors.
Routine steroid administration is probably an important
component of that strategy to improve recovery of or￾gans following brain death, but should not be used alone
and probably should be considered along with other hor￾monal factors, for which the respective contribution re￾mains to be defined.
Key messages
 Steroids and norepinephrine are equally effective in
achieving hemodynamic stability in various different
groups of brain-dead organ donors.
 Steroid administration alone fails to increase the
number of organs recovered for transplantation.
 Steroid administration did not demonstrate any
benefits for primary function recovery of
transplanted grafts.
 The decision to use steroids or norepinephrine was
not observed to affect meaningful outcomes for
hemodynamically stable brain-dead organ donors.
