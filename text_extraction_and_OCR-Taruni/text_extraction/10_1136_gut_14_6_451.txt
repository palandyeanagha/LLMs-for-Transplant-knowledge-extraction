Serum complement in chronic liver disease
B. J. POTTER, ANGELA M. TRUEMAN, AND E. A. JONES
From the Department of Medicine, Royal Free Hospital, London
SUMMARY Total serum haemolytic complement activity (CH50) and the serum concentrations of
both the third and fourth components ofthe complement system (C3 and C4) have been measured in 29
control subjects, 92 patients with chronic hepatocellular disease, and eight patients with large duct
biliary tract obstruction. The mean C4 concentration was reduced in all types of chronic liver disease
studied. However, the mean CH50 and C3 values were increased in compensated primary biliary
cirrhosis, were relatively normal in non-cirrhotic chronic active hepatitis, and were decreased in
cryptogenic cirrhosis, particularly when ascites was present. There was a significant correlation
between CH50 and C3 in patients with chronic liver disease but no correlation between CH5o and
C4 or between C3 and C4. Raised values for CH50 and C3 in primary biliary cirrhosis may be due at
least in part to concomitant cholestasis since these values tend to be raised in patients with large duct
biliary tract obstruction. Although primary biliary cirrhosis, chronic active hepatitis, and cryptogenic
cirrhosis are considered to be part of a spectrum of chronic liver disease associated with disturbed
immunity, the results of this study emphasize that there are clearly definable differences between
these diseases in terms of the pattern of changes in serum complement.
Although some types of chronic liver disease, such
as chronic active hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis,
and cryptogenic cirrhosis are usually associated with
evidence of disturbed immunity, so far no immune
mechanism has been demonstrated to be of funda￾mental importance in the pathogenesis of these
diseases. One well established cause of cell lysis and
death involves the complement system, classically
activated by antigen-antibody interaction on a cell
surface (Rapp and Borsos, 1970). If this immune
process is responsible for liver cell injury in patients
with chronic liver disease, there may be associated
changes in serum complement. However, changes in
the complement system may also arise as a conse￾quence of the disease process itself.
It has previously been shown that patients with
chronic liver disease tend to have a reduced total
serum complement haemolytic activity (Goldner,
1929; Jordan, 1953; Asherson, 1960; Townes, 1967;

obtained for the two estimates in these studies were
correlated neither with the patients' clinical state
nor with the results of liver function tests. A com￾parison has been made between total serum comple￾ment haemolytic activity and the serum concentration
of individual components of the complement
system in patients with acute hepatitis (Alpert,
Isselbacher, and Schur, 1971) and serial measure￾ments of the serum concentration of C3 have been
made in patients with acute infectious hepatitis and
serum hepatitis (Kosmidis and Leader-Williams,
1972). We report here the results of measurements of
the total serum complement haemolytic activity
(CH5o) and the serum concentrations of both the
third and fourth components of the complement
system (C3 and C4) in control subjects and patients
with chronic liver disease, including, in particular,
patients with chronic active hepatitis, primary biliary
cirrhosis, and cryptogenic cirrhosis. The data have
been correlated both with the patients' clinical state
and with the results of routine tests of liver function.

cirrhosis, and cryptogenic cirrhosis are considered
to represent part of a spectrum of immunological

liver disease (Read, 1971), the results of the present
studies indicate that there are strikingly different
patterns of change in the complement system in each
of these disorders.
Patients and Methods
CONTROL SUBJECTS AND PATIENTS
The subjects investigated comprised 29 normal
healthy controls, 92 patients with chronic hepato￾cellular disease, and eight patients with cholestasis
unassociated with chronic liver disease. The patients
with chronic liver disease included 30 patients with
cryptogenic cirrhosis, 22 patients with chronic active
hepatitis, 32 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis,
and eight patients with cirrhosis of the alcoholic.
The diagnosis in all of the patients with liver disease
had been confirmed by needle biopsy of the liver.
The distribution of age in all groups was similar with
the exception of the group of patients with chronic
active hepatitis who had a younger mean age distri￾bution. There was a predominance of females in the
groups of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis and
chronic active hepatitis.
METHODS
Ten ml of clotted peripheral blood was obtained
from each subject. The serum was separated and
stored at -20°C. Estimations of CH50 and C3 and
C4 concentrations were made within 10 days of the
sample being taken.
Whole serum complement activity
Duplicate determinations of the whole serum comple￾ment activity were made by the method of Kabat
and Mayer (1961) as modified by Rapp and Borsos
(1970). Sheep red blood cells in Alsever's solution
(Burrough's Wellcome Ltd), after sensitization with
rabbit haemolysin (Burrough's Wellcome Ltd), were
incubated for one hour at 37°C with varying dilu￾tions of the test serum, made up to a total volume of
7.5 ml. The 50% lysis point was then determined by
means of a Van Krogh plot, using values (determined
spectrophotometrically) between 20 and 80% lysis.
The serum volume for 50% lysis was then expressed
as a reciprocal value to give CH50 units. All samples
were processed in parallel with a standard guinea-pig
complement source (Burrough's Wellcome Ltd). The
reproducibility of the method was better than ± 10%
The third component of complement (C3)
The serum C3 concentration was measured using the
single radial immunodiffusion method of Mancini,
Carbonara, and Heremans (1965) and antihuman C3
prepared in rabbits (Hyland immunoplates). Three
reference sera ofknownC3 concentration (50, 100, 300
B. J. Potter, Angela M. Trueman, and E. A. Jones
mg/100 ml) (Hyland Laboratories) were incubated
at room temperature for 16 to 24 hours, together with
each set of test sera. All estimates of C3 concentration
were made in duplicate. The reproducibility of the
method was ± 10% which is in satisfactory agree￾ment with the data of Kohler and Muller-Eberhard
(1967).
The Jourth component of complement (C4)
The serum C4 concentration was measured using the
single radial immunodiffusion method of Mancini
(Mancini et al, 1965) and an antihuman C4 anti￾serum prepared in rabbits (Behringwerke). A refer￾ence serum of known C4 concentration (18 mg/100
ml) (Behringwerke) was diluted to give several
solutions containing different concentrations of C4.
These solutions were incubated for 24 hours at room
temperature with each set of appropriately diluted
test sera. The concentration of C4 in diluted test
sera always fell within the linear portions of the
standard curve. All estimates of C4 concentration
were made in duplicate. The reproducibility of the
method was ± 15%.
Results
The table gives the mean, SEM, and the number of
estimates of CH50, C3, and C4 respectively for each
group of subjects studied. The values for each of the
three estimates obtained in normal subjects agree
satisfactorily with other similar data on normal
subjects obtained by others (Klemperer, Gotoff,
Alper, Levin, and Rosen, 1965; Kohler and Muller￾Eberhard, 1967; Alpert et al, 1971).
DIFFERENCES IN SERUM COMPLEMENT IN
DIFFERENT DISEASE GROUPS
The mean C4 concentration was significantly reduced
in all groups of patients with chronic liver disease:
in primary biliary cirrhosis (p < 0-0005), in chronic
active hepatitis (p < 0.0005), in cryptogenic cirrhosis
(p < 0.0005), and in alcoholic cirrhosis (p < 0.0005).
There were clearly defined differences in the mean
values for CH50 and C3 concentration in different
groups of patients.
Primary biliary cirrhosis
In patients with well compensated primary biliary
cirrhosis, whereas the mean C4 concentration was
significantly reduced (p < 0.05), the mean CH50 value
was increased (p <0.0025), and the mean C3 con￾centration was also increased (p < 0.0005) (fig 1).
However, in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis
who had developed ascites both the mean CH50
(p < 0-005) and the mean C3 concentration (p < 0-0005)
were decreased.

Chronic active hepatitis
In contrast to patients with primary biliary cirrhosis,
patients who had chronic active hepatitis that had
not progressed to cirrhosis had values for CH50 and
C3 concentration that were little changed from those
in normal subjects. However, in those patients with
chronic active hepatitis that had progressed to cir￾rhosis, the mean CH50 was significantly decreased
(p < 0 0005) and the mean C3 concentration was also
decreased (p < 00005).
Cryptogenic cirrhosis
In the group of patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis,
the mean values for both CH50 (p < 00005) and C3
concentration (P< 00005) were reduced. The mean
values for CH,0 and C3 were particularly low once
the patients had developed ascites (see table).
Cirrhosis of the alcoholic
The CH50 and C3 values in the small group of patients
with alcoholic cirrhosis were similar to those in
normal subjects.
Large duct biliary tract obstruction
In patients with cholestasis due to large duct biliary
tract obstruction, the mean CHr0 was little changed
but the mean C3 concentration was elevated
(p < 0.0005), as was the mean C4 concentration
(p < 0-0025).
CORRELATIONS BETWEEN CH10, c3, AND c4
There was a significant correlation between CH50
and C3 in patients with chronic liver disease (r =

significant correlation between CH50 and C4 or
between C3 and C4.
RELATIONSHIP OF SERUM COMPLEMENT TO
BIOCHEMICAL TESTS OF LIVER FUNCTION
The relationships between values of CH50, C3, and
C4, and the serum levels of bilirubin, alkaline
phosphatase, aspartate transaminase, gamma glob￾ulin, and albumin were examined. There were slight
but significant correlations between CH50 and serum
albumin (r = 0434, p<0001) and between C3 and
serum albumin (r = 0.277, p< 0.05) in the whole
group of patients with chronic liver disease.
There was a negative correlation between C4 and
serum gamma globulin in the whole group of patients
with chronic liver disease (r = 0-398, P<0-00l).
Thus a low C4 concentration tended to be associated
with a high gamma globulin concentration.
No other significant correlations were found. In
particular values for CH50 and C3 concentration in
patients with primary biliary cirrhosis and large duct
biliary tract obstruction did not correlate closely with
the degree of cholestasis as measured by the serum
levels of bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase.
OTHER OBSERVATIONS
No relationship was found between values of CH50
and C3 and C4 concentration and the titres of anti￾mitochondrial antibody, smooth muscle antibody,
and antinuclear factor.
Only four- patients' sera were positive for hepatitis￾associated antigen and the complement levels in these
patients were not obviously different from those in

Discussion
The studies reported here provide results of three
different measurements of serum complement in a
group of patients with different types of chronic liver
disease. Our studies supplement and extend the data
of Finlayson, Krohn, Fauconnet, and Anderson
(1972). Of particular interest is the finding that al￾though chronic active hepatitis, primary biliary
cirrhosis, and cryptogenic cirrhosis are considered
to be part of a spectrum of chronic liver disease
associated with disturbed immunity (Read, 1971),
the results of the current studies indicate that there
are clearly definable differences between these diseases
in terms of changes in serum complement. In some
of the diseases studied, values for CH50, C3, and C4
did not change in parallel. This observation is high￾lighted by the lack of correlation between CH50 and
C4 and between C3 and C4.
The pattern of values of serum complement in
patients with compensated primary biliary cirrhosis
was distinct. Whereas both the mean CH50 and the
mean C3 concentration were increased, the mean C4
concentration was reduced. These results are at
variance with those of Pagaltsos et a! (1971), who
found consistently low values for CH50 in patients
with primary biliary cirrhosis. However, these
authors did not state whether their patients were in a
well compensated phase of the disease. The values
for CH60 and C3 concentration did not correlate
closely with the degree of cholestasis as measured by
the serum levels of alkaline phosphatase and bili￾rubin. However, raised values for total haemolytic
complement activity have been found in patients
with cholestasis due to large duct biliary tract obstruc￾tion (Jordan, 1953; Mandel and Lange, 1955;
Asherson, 1960; Farini et al, 1970; Pagaltsos et al,
1971). The value for CH50 was also raised in a patient
with cholestasis due to chlorpromazine (Asherson,
1960). It would appear, therefore, that cholestasis
could be a non-immunological cause of an increase
in the total haemolytic complement activity.
The increased serum concentration of C3 in
patients with primary biliary cirrhosis is probably
associated with an increased synthetic rate of this
protein, and hence a higher catabolic rate. In one
patient with primary biliary cirrhosis and a raised
serum concentration of C3, highly purified radio￾2
455
iodinated C3 was injected intravenously and the
plasma disappearance curve of radioactivity was
defined. The calculated turnover rate of the
protein was 9.99% of the intravascular pool per
hour in the patient, compared with 1.87 % in a con￾trol subject who had received some of the same
labelled preparation (Potter, Trueman, and Jones,
1973).
An increased value for CH,50 may be associated
with an increased serum concentration of one or
more of the components of the complement system.
That an increased mean value for CH50 is associated
with a decreased mean C4 concentration in primary
biliary cirrhosis suggests that C4 is normally present
in excess in the serum for normal activation of the
complement system. Indeed, it has been suggested
that other components, C2 and CS, are rate limiting
in the complement cascade (Cooper and Muller￾Eberhard, 1970). The association of increased
concentrations of C3 with decreased concentrations
of C4 in primary biliary cirrhosis implies that there
are fundamentally different mechanisms involved in
the control of the serum concentrations of these two
proteins.
In contrast to CH50 and C3, the mean C4 concen￾tration was reduced in all groups of patients with
chronic liver disease. The observation that low C4
concentration tended to be associated with high serum
gamma globulin values suggests an association with
abnormal immunological activity but does not
necessarily imply the utilization of C4 in an immune
process.
There are a number of possible mechanisms which
could account for low values for serum complement
in patients with chronic liver disease. (1) If some
complement components are synthesized by the
hepatic parenchymal cells (Alper, Johnson, Birtch,
and Moore, 1969; Colten, 1972), their synthetic rate
may be reduced as a direct consequence of injury
and death of these cells. (2) If some complement
components are synthesized at extrahepatic sites
(Colten, Borsos, and Rapp, 1966; Littleton, Kessler,
and Burkholder, 1970), then their synthetic rate may
be reduced by the effect of metabolic disturbances
associated with liver failure on the synthetic mech￾anisms. (3) There may be circulating inactivators of
complement components (Spitzer, Vallota, Forristal,
Sudor, Stitzel, Davis, and West, 1969; Peters,
Martin, Weinstein, Cameron, Barratt, Ogg, and
Lachmann, 1972). (4) There may be increased
consumption by antigen-antibody complexes and
consequently increased activation of complement
(Lachmann, Muller-Eberhard, Kunkel, and
Paronetto, 1961; Wilson and Dixon, 1970; Kohler
and Ten Bensel, 1969). (5) There may be increased
endogenous catabolism or increased loss of these

components into the urinary or gastrointestinal
tracts. (6) Finally, the tendency for the plasma
volume to be increased in these patients could be a
contributory factor (Lieberman and Reynolds, 1967).
Further insight into the mechanisms responsible
for low values for serum complement in chronic
liver disease may come from studies of the metabolic
behaviour in vivo of purified radioiodinated comple￾ment components and the screening of sera from
these patients for conversion products of individual
components. In the present series the values for
serum complement tended to be particularly low
when there was evidence of severe hepatic decom￾pensation, such as ascites. Even in these patients or
in patients with massive hepatic necrosis (Fox,
Dudley, and Sherlock, 1971) it cannot be assumed
that low levels of serum complement can be attributed
wholly to a reduced synthetic rate by the liver. The
sites of synthesis of the various complement com￾ponents are not established with certainty and even
if their synthetic rate is reduced, there may be
concomitant increased consumption of these com￾ponents.
