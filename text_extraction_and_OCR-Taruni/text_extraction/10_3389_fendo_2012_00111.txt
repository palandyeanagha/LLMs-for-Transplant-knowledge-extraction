The deorphanization of the free fatty acid (FFA) receptors FFA1 (GPR40), FFA2 (GPR43),
FFA3 (GPR41), GPR84, and GPR120 has made clear that the body is capable of recognizing
and responding directly to nonesterified fatty acid of virtually any chain length. Colonic
fermentation of dietary fiber produces high concentrations of the short-chain fatty acids
(SCFAs) acetate, propionate and butyrate, a process which is important to health. The
phylogenetically related 7-transmembrane (7TM) receptors free fatty acid receptor 2 (FFA2)
and FFA3 are activated by these SCFAs, and several lines of evidence indicate that FFA2
and FFA3 mediate beneficial effects associated with a fiber-rich diet, and that they may be
of interest as targets for treatment of inflammatory and metabolic diseases. FFA2 is highly
expressed on immune cells, in particular neutrophils, and several studies suggest that the
receptor plays a role in diseases involving a dysfunctional neutrophil response, such as
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Both FFA2 and FFA3 have been implicated in metabolic
diseases such as type 2 diabetes and in regulation of appetite. More research is however
required to clarify the potential of the receptors as drug targets and establish if activation
or inhibition would be the preferred mode of action. The availability of potent and selective
receptor modulators is a prerequisite for these studies. The few modulators of FFA2 or
FFA3 that have been published hitherto in the peer-reviewed literature in general have
properties that make them less than ideal as such tools, but published patent applications
indicate that better tool compounds might soon become available which should enable
studies critical to validate the receptors as new drug targets.

INTRODUCTION
Fatty acids, mostly in esterified form, make up a fundamental
component in biology. It has long been recognized that certain
nonesterified fatty acids are involved in regulation of metabolism
and the immune system, for example, by conversion of arachi￾donic acid to potent signaling substances such as prostaglandins
and leukotrienes. The realization that saturated or unsaturated
free fatty acids (FFAs) of virtually any length can act directly
as signaling molecules through cell surface receptors is how￾ever much more recent, and came with the identification of
the 7-transmembrane receptors FFA1, FFA2, FFA3, GPR84, and
GPR120, all activated by FFAs of various chain length.
In 1997, the genes GPR40, GPR41, GPR42, and GPR43 were
discovered in the course of a search for novel subtypes of the
unrelated galanin receptor (Sawzdargo et al., 1997). The deor￾phanizations of the corresponding receptors GPR40, GPR41, and
GPR43 were reported in 2003, when it became clear that they all
respond to FFAs (Briscoe et al., 2003; Brown et al., 2003; Kotarsky
et al., 2003; Le Poul et al., 2003; Nilsson et al., 2003), and the
receptors were later renamed to FFA1, FFA3, and FFA2, respec￾tively (http://www.iuphar.org/). GPR42 was first believed to be
an inactive pseudogene, but was recently found to be a functional
polymorph of GPR41 with 98% overall identity and 100% iden￾tity in the transmembrane (TM) domains (Liaw and Connolly,
2009). Subsequently, the phylogenetically distinct FFA receptors
GPR84 and GPR120 have been identified (Hirasawa et al., 2005;
Wang et al., 2006).
FFAs are generally divided into short-chain fatty acids
(SCFAs), consisting of 1–6 carbon atoms, medium-chain fatty
acids (MCFAs), with 7–12 carbon atoms, and long-chain fatty
acids (LCFAs), with more than 12 carbon atoms. FFA1 (GPR40)
is highly expressed in the pancreatic β-cells and is activated by
saturated and unsaturated LCFAs and to a less extent by MCFAs,
resulting in enhancement of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion,
and was thus identified as a new potential target for treatment of
type 2 diabetes (Itoh et al., 2003). This observation has attracted
much attention, and several series of FFA1 ligands have been
identified (Briscoe et al., 2006; Garrido et al., 2006; Song et al.,
2007; Christiansen et al., 2008, 2010, 2011, 2012; Tan et al.,
2008; Tikhonova et al., 2008; Humphries et al., 2009; Negoro
et al., 2010, 2012; Sasaki et al., 2011; Houze et al., 2012; Mikami
et al., 2012), of which the most advanced compound has demon￾strated good efficacy in phase II studies and currently undergoes
phase III clinical trials (Burant et al., 2012). GPR84 and GPR120
respond to MCFAs and LCFAs, respectively. These receptors have
so far received less attention than FFA1 as potential drug tar￾gets, even though activation of GPR120 is associated with release
of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), increased insulin sensitivity

Ulven FFA2 and FFA3 as therapeutic targets
and repression of macrophage-induced inflammation (Hirasawa
et al., 2005; Oh et al., 2010). The recent finding that dysfunctional
GPR120 lead to obesity in both mouse and human is expected
to attract more attention to this receptor (Ichimura et al., 2012).
Only a few ligands with moderate potency have until now been
published on GPR84 and GPR120 (Briscoe et al., 2006; Wang
et al., 2006; Suzuki et al., 2008). The first potent and selective
GPR120 agonist was disclosed only recently (Shimpukade et al.,
2012). In contrast to the other fatty acid receptors, FFA2 and
FFA3 are activated by SCFAs. The receptors are phylogenetically
related to FFA1, and pharmacological profiles of the three recep￾tors have been thoroughly discussed in several excellent reviews
(Brown et al., 2005; Covington et al., 2006; Milligan et al., 2006;
Hirasawa et al., 2008; Stoddart et al., 2008b; Ichimura et al., 2009;
Wellendorph et al., 2009; Hudson et al., 2011). This review will
focus on the potential roles of the SCFA receptors FFA2 and FFA3
as targets for discovery of new therapeutics, and the currently
known ligands for the receptors will be examined.
THE POTENTIAL ROLES OF FFA2 AND FFA3 AS DRUG
TARGETS
FFA2 and FFA3 were deorphanized simultaneously by three inde￾pendent groups (Brown et al., 2003; Le Poul et al., 2003; Nilsson
et al., 2003). The receptors are activated by high micromolar or
millimolar concentrations of SCFAs, most notably acetate, propi￾onate and butyrate, which are produced in total concentrations
up to above 100 mM by colonic fermentation of dietary fiber
(Topping and Clifton, 2001). FFA3 responds somewhat more
strongly to the longer SCFAs, thus, formic acid (C1) and acetic
acid (C2) exhibit higher potency at the human FFA2, whereas
valeric acid (C5) and caproic acid (C6) have higher potency at
hFFA3 (Brown et al., 2003; Le Poul et al., 2003). Although FFA2
and FFA3 were deorphanized about at the same time as FFA1,
they have until now received less attention as drug discovery tar￾gets. One likely reason for this is that the indications that can be
targeted by FFA2 and FFA3 have been less clear-cut than for FFA1.
FFA2
FFA2 is expressed most highly in immune cells such as periph￾eral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and polymorphonuclear
cells (PMN) with an especially high expression found in neu￾trophils (Brown et al., 2003; Le Poul et al., 2003; Nilsson et al.,
2003). Several studies have demonstrated that FFA2 mediates the
chemotactic effects of SCFAs on neutrophils (Le Poul et al., 2003;
Maslowski et al., 2009; Sina et al., 2009; Vinolo et al., 2011).
These observations suggested that FFA2 could be of interests for
treatment of diseases associated with an excessive or defect neu￾trophil response, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or
alcoholism-associated immune depression.
A high intake of fiber is associated with decreased risk of and
beneficial effects on the IBDs ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease
(Hou et al., 2011). The recent observation that FFA2-deficient
mice show exacerbated or unresolving inflammation in mod￾els of colitis, arthritis and asthma, and that germ-free wild-type
mice, unable to convert fiber to SCFAs, show similarly exacer￾bated inflammatory conditions, indicate that SCFAs and FFA2
represents a link between a fiber-rich diet and its beneficial effects
on the immune system and inflammation (Maslowski et al.,
2009). These observations suggest that FFA2 agonists could be
of interest for the treatment of IBD. On the other hand, FFA2-
knockout mice exhibited diminished inflammatory response to
dextrane sodium sulfate-induced colitis, a common model of
IBD, and in particular exhibited reduced infiltration of PMNs
(Sina et al., 2009). These results indicate that antagonists of
FFA2 could have a role in treatment of intestinal inflammation.
PMNs however also protect against bacterial infection or translo￾cation, and there is a risk that FFA2 antagonists might interfere
with these protective effects. Thus, although a link between FFA2
and IBD has been established, it is at present unclear if ago￾nists or antagonists of FFA2 would be the preferred treatment.
A recent study found elevated expression of FFA2 and FFA3
in fetal membranes and placenta after onset of labor, and that
treatment of amnion explants with LPS significantly increased
FFA2 expression, whereas co-treatment with LPS and propionate
reduced the inflammatory response (Voltolini et al., 2012). These
results suggest that FFA2 agonists could reduce maternal and
fetal inflammation and might counteract preterm labor triggered
by this.
It is known that SCFAs have tumor suppressive properties,
effects that have been explained e.g., by inhibition of histone
deacetylase (Medina et al., 1997). A recent report shows that
FFA2 expression frequently is reduced or lost in colon cancer cells
(Tang et al., 2011). Restoration of FFA2 expression in the tumor
cells followed by propionate treatment induced G0/G1 cell cycle
arrest, activated caspases, upregulated p21, decreased cyclin D3
and cyclin dependent kinases 1 and 2, and increased apoptotic
cell death (Tang et al., 2011). The results suggest that FFA2 func￾tions as a tumor suppressor and provides a possible mechanism
for the putative connection between a high-fiber diet and lower
incidence of colon cancer.
FFA2 has also been proposed to play a role in regulation
of appetite and metabolism (Sleeth et al., 2010). A fiber-rich
diet is linked to lower body weight and lower incidence of dia￾betes (Psaltopoulou et al., 2010), and some evidence indicates
that SCFAs produced by colonic fermentation of fiber may be
responsible for this through FFA2 (Sleeth et al., 2010). High-fiber
diets are associated with increased levels of peptide YY (PYY),
a hormone known to decrease appetite (Karra and Batterham,
2010). FFA2 is found to be expressed in enteroendocrine L cells,
responsible for PYY secretion (Karaki et al., 2006, 2008). The L
cells are also responsible for GLP-1 secretion, a potent anorectic
incretin hormone which also regulate insulin secretion from pan￾creatic β-cells and increase insulin sensitivity in target tissue. It
was recently demonstrated that expression of FFA2 and FFA3 is
enriched in L cells and that FFA2 mediate SCFA-promoted GLP￾1 release from mixed colonic cultures in vitro (Tolhurst et al.,
2012). These observations indicate that FFA2 agonists can have
potential as therapeutics for treatment of type 2 diabetes and
related metabolic conditions. FFA2 is also expressed in the murine
pancreatic β-cell line MIN6 and isolated mouse islets (Kebede
et al., 2009; Halpern et al., 2012), but the role of the receptor in
β-cells is still unclear.
Also related to the effects of dietary fiber on body weight
are the observations that FFA2 is expressed in murine adipose
Frontiers in Endocrinology | Molecular and Structural Endocrinology October 2012 | Volume 3 | Article 111 | 2

Ulven FFA2 and FFA3 as therapeutic targets
tissue and that acetate and propionate affect adipogenesis and
adipocyte differentiation through FFA2 in mice (Hong et al.,
2005). Activation of FFA2 furthermore leads to inhibition of
lipolysis and suppression of plasma FFAs without the flushing
associated with nicotinic acid, and the receptor may thus rep￾resent a target for treatment of dyslipidemia (Ge et al., 2008).
The beneficial effects on high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels
observed after moderate alcohol consumption might be at least
partially a consequence of acetate, a metabolite of ethanol, on
FFA2. A recent study found that FFA2-deficient mice on a high-fat
diet exhibited improved glucose control, reduced body fat mass
and increased insulin sensitivity, indicating that FFA2 antago￾nists might be of interest for treatment of metabolic disorders
(Bjursell et al., 2011). Another recent study found that inulin-type
fructans, known to counteract high-fat diet-induced obesity and
other metabolic disorders, inhibited the FFA2 overexpression in
adipose tissue normally seen with high-fat diets (Dewulf et al.,
2011).
Thus, several lines of evidence link FFA2 to food intake, body
weight and metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes. More
research is however required to firmly conclude that FFA2 is an
attractive target for these conditions and clarify if agonists or
antagonists will be the preferred mode of treatment.
FFA3
FFA3 was deorphanized independently by two groups (Brown
et al., 2003; Le Poul et al., 2003). Both groups found FFA3 mRNA
broadly expressed in various tissue, including pancreas, PBMC,
spleen and adipose. Brown and co-workers found especially high
levels of FFA3 mRNA in human adipose tissue and confirmed
high expression in white adipose tissue with immunohistochem￾istry using an antibody specific for hFFA3 and hGPR42 (Brown
et al., 2003). Subsequently, expression of FFA3 in both human
and mouse adipose tissue was confirmed and it was found that
SCFAs stimulate production of the anorexigenic hormone lep￾tin in primary mouse white adipose tissue through FFA3 (Xiong
et al., 2004). Hong and co-workers (2005) were however unable
to detect FFA3 in murine adipose tissue or 3T3-L1 adipocytes,
but found high levels of FFA2. They found that blocking FFA2
expression with siRNA blocked adipocyte differentiation, and
concluded that the effects of SCFAs on adipocytes in mice are
mediated through FFA2 rather than FFA3 (Hong et al., 2005).
This conclusion was supported by Zaibi and co-workers (2010),
who also failed to detect FFA3 mRNA in mouse adipose tissue
and furthermore observed that FFA2 expression was consistently
reduced in adipose tissue of FFA3 knockout mice compared to
wild type mice. They confirmed SCFA-promoted leptin secretion
in wild-type mice and reduced secretion in the FFA3 knockout
mice, an effect which was explained by concomitant down￾regulation of FFA2 in the FFA3 knockouts (Zaibi et al., 2010).
These observations underline the need for selective tool com￾pounds in the further study of these receptors.
Like FFA2, FFA3 is expressed in enteroendocrine cells secret￾ing the satiety hormone PYY and may be implicated in its release
(Karaki et al., 2006). The receptor is also, like FFA1 and FFA2,
expressed in pancreatic β-cells (Kebede et al., 2009; Halpern et al.,
2012), but its role in these cells is at present unclear, although
a patent application indicates that FFA3 agonists inhibit insulin
secretion (see below). Samuel and co-workers found FFA3-
knockout mice to be significantly leaner than wild-type mice.
The difference disappeared in germ-free mice, indicating that the
effect depends on SCFAs produced by fermentation. Deletion of
FFA3 was associated with reduced secretion of PYY, but without
affecting the amount of chow consumed by the mice. This led
the authors to suggest that the reduction in weight is a result of
the increased gut motility by the lower PYY level, leading to a
reduced uptake of SCFAs (Samuel et al., 2008). The lean pheno￾type of FFA3 knockout mice is inconsistent with its suggested role
as mediator of leptin secretion. However, Zaibi et al. (2010) men￾tion unpublished observations that male FFA3 knockout mice are
obese rather than lean.
SCFAs and ketone bodies are found to regulate the sympa￾thetic nervous system directly through FFA3 at the sympathetic
ganglion. SCFAs stimulate the sympathetic outflow by activat￾ing FFA3, whereas β-hydroxybutyrate (1, Figure 1), a metabolite
produced during the ketogenic state of starvation or diabetes,
antagonize FFA3 and thereby suppress the sympathetic nervous
system (Kimura et al., 2011). Thus, FFA3 appears to contribute to
sympathetic activation in the fed state when glucose is the main
fuel and abundant production of SCFAs by colonic fermentation
of dietary fiber take place, whereas the receptor contributes to
energy conservation under ketogenic conditions during fasting.
This observation implicates that FFA3 agonists could represent a
potential treatment of obesity.
Several studies have connected FFA3 with metabolic regula￾tion and energy expenditure, but expression in adipose tissue
is controversial and the overall function of the receptor is still
unclear. Further research is therefore required to clarify the pic￾ture and selective tool compounds would be highly valuable to
this research.

Ulven FFA2 and FFA3 as therapeutic targets
LIGANDS FOR FFA2 AND FFA3
Although it is a decade since FFA2 and FFA3 were deorphanized,
few ligands have been reported for the receptors. The initial pub￾lications disclosed EC50 values for SCFAs in the high micromolar
and low millimolar range, corresponding to physiological concen￾trations (Brown et al., 2003; Le Poul et al., 2003; Nilsson et al.,
2003). The potency rank order of SCFAs for FFA2 is acetate (C2)
∼ propionate (C3) > butyrate (C4) > valerate (C5) > formate
(C1). The corresponding rank order for FFA3 was somewhat dif￾ferent, with propionate (C3) ∼ butyrate (C4) ∼ valerate (C5) >
acetate (C2) > caproate (C6). Thus, FFA2 has a preference for the
shorter SCFAs, whereas FFA3 prefer the longer SCFAs, with propi￾onate (C3) being among the most potent SCFA for both receptors
(Figure 1).
By site-directed mutagenesis, an arginine residue near the
top of TM helix 5 and another arginine at the top of TM 7
were found to be critical for the recognition of SCFAs for both
FFA2 (Arg1805.39, Arg2557.35) and FFA3 (Arg1855.39, Arg2587.35)
(Figure 2) (Stoddart et al., 2008a). Two corresponding residues in
FFA1 (Arg1835.39 and Arg2587.35) are likewise critical for recogni￾tion of LCFAs (Sum et al., 2007). Thus, the two arginines function
as conserved anchoring residues for the fatty acid carboxylate
group throughout the FFA1-3 receptor subfamily. In addition, the
mutation His(VI:20/6.55)Ala in hFFA2 or hFFA3 eliminated the
response to SCFAs (Stoddart et al., 2008a). The corresponding
residue in FFA1, Asn2446.55, is also critical for FFA recognition.
Furthermore, mutation of His1464.56 to alanine eliminated SCFA
response in FFA3, whereas the corresponding mutations in FFA2
(His1404.56) or FFA1 (His1364.56) only reduced the response to
SCFAs and LCFAs, respectively (Sum et al., 2007; Stoddart et al.,
2008a). Thus, the recognition of the fatty acid carboxylate group
appears to take place by a conserved mechanism in FFA1, FFA2,
and FFA3.
The low potency and selectivity of the SCFAs on FFA2
and FFA3 make them difficult starting points for optimization
and generally unsuitable as pharmacological tool compounds.
However, when their size is taken into account, the potency of
acetate and propionate on these receptors is quite impressive
and ligand efficiency calculations indicate that it is unrealistic to
expect higher potency without significantly increasing the size of
the compounds (Schmidt et al., 2011). To explore the structure￾activity relationships around the SCFAs on FFA2 and FFA3, a
diverse selection of small carboxylic acids with lipophilic tails,
including branched, cyclic and unsaturated, were selected and

Ulven FFA2 and FFA3 as therapeutic targets
characterized on hFFA2 and hFFA3. None of the compounds
exhibited higher potency than the most potent SCFAs, but the
study resulted in the elucidation of a general rule for predict￾ing the selectivity of small carboxylic acids for FFA2 or FFA3:
Ligands with substituted sp3-hybridized α-carbons preferentially
activate FFA3, while ligands with sp2- or sp-hybridized α-carbons
prefer FFA2 (Schmidt et al., 2011). For example, propiolic acid
(2), angelic acid (3) and (E)-2-methylcrotonic acid (4) are all
at least 10–100-fold selective for hFFA2 over hFFA3, whereas
1-methylcyclopropanecarboxylic acid (5), cyclopropylacetic acid
(6) and 2-methylbutyric acid (7) have distinct selectivity for
hFFA3 over hFFA2 (Figure 1). The compounds were inactive
on the Arg(V:05/5.39)Ala and Arg(VII:01/7.35)Ala mutants, con￾firming interaction at the orthosteric binding site. Moreover, by
swapping three nonconserved amino acid residues between FFA2
and FFA3 (Figure 2), the selectivity of 4 and 5 was inverted
(Schmidt et al., 2011). This thorough understanding of the bind￾ing site interaction and selectivity of the small carboxylic acids
makes a good basis for using these structures in the discovery of
selective FFA2 and FFA3 ligands, for example in a fragment-based
approach.
The bovine FFA2 is less sensitive to the shortest SCFAs and
responds most strongly to caproic acid (C6), probably reflecting
a digestion adapted for non-digestible carbohydrates and higher
levels of SCFAs (Hudson et al., 2012). Mutation of Cys1414.57 in
hFFA2 (Figure 2) to the Gly corresponding to the bovine recep￾tor transferred a similar ligand selectivity to the human receptor.
By introducing a second H242Q mutation in hFFA2, the receptor
lost its response to SCFAs, which was taken advantage of in the
construction of a receptor activated solely by a synthetic ligand
(RASSL) of FFA2 (Hudson et al., 2012).
Amgen has described two closely related phenylacetamides
as allosteric agonists of FFA2 (Figure 3). The compounds are
completely selective for FFA2 over FFA3 and FFA1, produce
full agonistic response alone, and act in a positively coop￾erative fashion with acetate or propionate. Both compounds
were shown to activate Gαi and Gαq pathways and to inhibit
lipolysis in adipocytes (Lee et al., 2008). The racemic compound
(rac-8) was identified by high-throughput screening, of which the
(S)-enantiomer AMG7703 (8, Figure 3) was found to be respon￾sible for the activity. Mutational studies have been performed to
identify the binding mode of 8 and related compounds, how￾ever, residues that interfere with 8 without significantly affecting
acetate or propionate activity have not been identified and the
exact binding of the ligands remains somewhat unclear (Lee et al.,
2008; Smith et al., 2011). It is however clear that the binding

of 8 does not depend on Arg1805.39 and Arg2557.35, both of
which serve as critical carboxylic acid anchoring points for the
SCFAs (Swaminath et al., 2010; Smith et al., 2011). Interestingly,
replacement of ECL2 of FFA2 by the corresponding sequence
from FFA3 did not affect the potency of 8 or propionate, but
resulted in reduced efficacy and abolishment of the cooperative
effect between the two compounds (Smith et al., 2011). Attempts
to optimize these compounds have been made, however, despite
the synthesis of a large number of analogs with modifications
introduced in all parts of the structure, it has turned out difficult
to significantly improve their relatively moderate potency (Wang
et al., 2010; Smith et al., 2011). Besides insufficient potency,
the compounds also suffer from moderate solubility and poor
pharmacokinetic properties (Wang et al., 2010), and are therefore
of limited use as tool compounds for in vitro and in vivo studies.
No FFA2 or FFA3 modulators with desirable potency and
properties have yet been reported in peer reviewed journals, but
FFA2 ligands of interest have been described in recent patent
applications. Euroscreen has patented a compound series of FFA2
agonists disclosing compounds with potency down to EC50 =
13 nM (Figure 4) and claims their use in treatment of metabolic
disorders (Hoveyda et al., 2010). A representative compound (12)
increases glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 cells in a dose dependent
manner. The increased glucose uptake was slight but significant
at 1μM and almost doubled at 30μM. The phenylacetamide
8 was not observed to increase glucose uptake in this assay.
Furthermore, 12 dose-dependently inhibited lipolysis in isolated
adipocytes. Again, 8 showed no effect in the assay. Compound 12
was also found to increase glucose uptake in isolated adipocytes
by 100% already at 1μM concentration. Another representative
FIGURE 4 | FFA2 agonists (Euroscreen). The EC50 values are from GTPγS
binding in a scintillation proximity assay (Hoveyda et al., 2010, 2011a,b,c,d).

FIGURE 5 | FFA2 antagonists (Euroscreen and Galapagos). The IC50
value of 17 is from a GTPγS assay in CHO cells expressing FFA2 using
propionate (600μM) as agonist (Brantis et al., 2011). The IC50 value of 18
reflects a calcium mobilization assay and a GTPγS assay (Saniere et al.,
2012).
(13) was found to increase GLP-1 secretion from NCI-H716 cells
(Hoveyda et al., 2010). Euroscreen has moreover claimed the
compound series for treatment of gastrointestinal disorders and
inflammatory diseases, including IBD, and has found representa￾tives to decrease colonic contractility and motility and to decrease
TNF-α and IL-6 release from PBMCs stimulated with LPS
(Hoveyda et al., 2011a,b). A series of constrained lactam analogs
has appeared in a recent patent application (Hoveyda et al.,
2011d), including compounds with EC50 down to 21 nM (14) and
one representative (15) demonstrated in concentrations from 0.1
to 30μM to significantly and dose dependently increased GLP-1
secretion from a rat lower intestinal cell preparation. A separate
series of 5-aryl-2-acylpyrrollidinecarboxylic acid FFA2 agonists
also patented by Euroscreen contains several members with
EC50 <200 nM. Of these, 16 was found to inhibit isoprenaline￾induced lipolysis in rat adipocytes and reduce the blood glucose
level in ob/ob mice after glucose challenge following 28 days of
chronic treatment (Figure 4) (Hoveyda et al., 2011c).
Euroscreen has furthermore patented a series of FFA2 antago￾nists for treatment or prevention of inflammatory, gastrointesti￾nal and metabolic disorders, including 17, which was disclosed
with IC50 = 10 nM in a calcium-based assay and 20 nM in a
GTPγS assay (Figure 5). Homologous competition binding stud￾ies with tritiated 17 exhibited pIC50 ∼8 in a human FFA2 recom￾binant cell line and pIC50 ∼6 in neutrophils. The radiotracer
was also displaced from the FFA2 transfected cells by propionate
with pIC50 ∼2.5, suggesting orthosteric interaction (Brantis et al.,
2011). This observation demonstrates that the orthosteric bind￾ing site can accommodate ligands that are larger than valeric acid
(C5, Figure 1). It indeed appears reasonable to hypothesize that
all ligands in Figures 4 and 5 act as orthosteric ligands and that
their carboxylic acid residues are engaged in interactions similar
to those of the endogenous SCFAs.
A series of azetidine FFA2 antagonists is claimed for treat￾ment of inflammatory conditions and autoimmune, infectious,
cardiometabolic, and proliferative diseases in a recent patent
application from Galapagos (Saniere et al., 2012). The represen￾tative compound 18 exhibited IC50 below 100 nM in a calcium
mobilization assay, a GTPγS binding assay, both using acetate at a
concentration corresponding to EC80, and a neutrophil migration
assay using acetate as chemoattractant.
There has been less activity directed toward development of
selective FFA3 modulators. An early patent application from
FIGURE 6 | FFA3 modulators (Arena) (Leonard et al., 2006).
Arena claims methods and compounds related to FFA3 (Leonard
et al., 2006). The application describes results showing that FFA3
is highly expressed in human and mouse pancreas, that the
receptor is upregulated in db/db mice, compared to wild-type
mice and leptin-deficient ob/ob mice, and that it is expressed
in the insulin-producing β-cell lines NIT-1, βTC-6, and MIN6.
Several compounds are disclosed as FFA3 agonists or antagonists.
Cyclopropanecarboxylic acid, a mixed FFA2/FFA3 agonist with
moderate selectivity for FFA3 (Schmidt et al., 2011), was found
to inhibit insulin secretion from the murine insulinoma cell line
MIN6. The patent application also discloses the structure of FFA3
agonists such as 19 (Figure 6) and FFA3 antagonists such as 20,
but no indication of their potencies is given. The FFA3 agonist 19
reverses the beneficial effect on oral glucose tolerance test of the
GPR119 agonist B111 (AR231453) in mice, which might imply
that agonism is not the preferred mode of action.
CONCLUSION
It is clear that the intestinal microbiome has a significant influ￾ence on health (Kau et al., 2011). An illustrative example of this is
provided by a recent study demonstrating that a lower number of
colonic bacterial species is associated with higher body weight in
pairs of lean and obese twins (Turnbaugh et al., 2009). A fiber￾rich diet has long been established as a significant contributor
to good health. The gut microbiome is responsible for the fer￾mentation of dietary fiber, which leads to production of SCFAs
and several beneficial health effects. Recent results suggest that
the SCFA receptors FFA2 and FFA3 are implicated in several of
these health effects.
FFA2 and FFA3 were deorphanized at the same time as FFA1,
but have received comparably less attention as drug targets.
Accumulating evidence however indicates that the receptors are
of interest as potential targets for treatment of various condi￾tions and diseases related to immunology and metabolism. FFA2
plays a role in certain immune diseases where neutrophils are
implicated, such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. Both
FFA2 and FFA3 have been implicated with weight regulation and
metabolic diseases like type 2 diabetes by several lines of evidence,
although some contradictory results blurs the picture for FFA3.
Both receptors are expressed in the intestines and it was recently
reported that FFA2 mediates SCFA-promoted GLP-1 release.
Results are described in recent patent applications indicating
that FFA2 agonists indeed promote GLP-1 release and that

Ulven FFA2 and FFA3 as therapeutic targets
they furthermore increase glucose uptake in adipocytes, thus
providing support for the notion that FFA2 agonists could
be of interest for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Although
the prospects look interesting, additional research is neces￾sary to firmly establish the receptors as drug targets and
the mode of action for drug candidates. Potent and selective
tool compounds will be required for such studies, and recent
patent applications indicate that such tools might soon become
available.
