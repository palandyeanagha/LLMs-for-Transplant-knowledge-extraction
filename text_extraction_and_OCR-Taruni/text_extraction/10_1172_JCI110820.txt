A B S T R A C T Micropuncture studies have shown that
glomerular filtration rate (GFR) falls in response to a
rise in Na' or Cl- concentrations in the loop of Henle,
whereas studies in isolated kidneys have shown that
GFR falls in response to osmotic diuresis. To define
the separate effects of an acute increase in plasma so￾dium (PNa), chloride (Pci) or osmolality (Posmoi), changes
in renal blood flow (RBF) and GFR were measured
during intrarenal infusions of hypertonic NaCl,
NaHCO3, Na acetate, dextrose, NH4Cl or NH4acetate
to denervated kidneys. The infusions raised Posmol at
the experimental kidney by 30-45 mosmol. RBF in￾creased abruptly by 10-30% with all hypertonic in￾fusions indicating that an acute increase in plasma to￾nicity causes renal vasodilatation. Renal vasodilatation
persisted or increased further during infusion of dex￾trose, NaHCO3 and Na acetate, but GFR was un￾changed. In contrast, during infusion of the two Cl￾containing solutions, vasodilatation was reversed after
1-5 min and RBF and GFR decreased (P < 0.01) below
preinfusion levels. Prior salt depletion doubled the
vasoconstriction seen with hypertonic NaCl infusions.
Overall, changes in RBF were unrelated to changes in
PNa or fractional Na or fluid reabsorption but corre￾lated with changes in P(:I (r = -0.91) and fractional
Cl- reabsorption (r = 0.94). The intrafemoral arterial
infusion of the two Cl-containing solutions did not in￾crease femoral vascular resistance. In conclusion, hy￾perchloremia produces a progressive renal vasocon￾striction and fall in GFR that is independent of the
renal nerves, is potentiated by prior salt depletion and
is related to tubular Cl- reabsorption. Chloride-in￾duced vasoconstriction appears specific for the renal
vessels.
INTRODUCTION
The maintenance of fluid and electrolyte balance by
the kidney is achieved by integrated adjustments in
glomerular filtration and tubular reabsorption. When

the adequacy of the extracellular volume (ECV)' is
threatened by salt depletion, impaired proximal tubule
reabsorption or a high perfusion pressure, renal va￾soconstriction restricts the volume of filtrate delivered
to the tubules (1-5). A mechanism that can relate glo￾merular filtration to distal fluid delivery has been iden￾tified in micropuncture experiments in which single
nephron glomerular filtration rate (SNGFR) has been
found to fall during a selective increase in the Na+ or
Cl- concentrations or osmolality of early distal tubule
fluid (6-8).
In previous experiments, we (9) and others (10, 11)
showed that intrarenal infusion of hypertonic NaCI
solution causes transient vasodilatation followed by
sustained vasoconstriction. Schnermann et al. (8) dem￾onstrated that retrograde injection of Cl-containing
solutions into the distal tubule regularly elicited a de￾crease in SNGFR, whereas similar injections of Na￾containing solutions did not. In contrast, in experi￾ments on the isolated kidney, Nizet (12-14) concluded
that there was no specific effect of increased Na+ or
Cl- concentration on renal vascular resistance but that
the GFR varied in direct proportion to tubular fluid
reabsorption. To settle these differences between the
responses of the isolated kidney and the nephron per￾fused retrogradely, changes in renal vascular resistance
of the intact kidney occurring in response to an acute
increase in plasma sodium (PNa), chloride (Pc1), or os￾molality (Posmoi) were investigated.

Dogs were anesthetized with intravenous pentobarbitol
and were ventilated mechanically (arterial blood pco2, 32-
42 mmHg). Mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) was re￾corded via a cannula in a femoral artery (as the damped
electrical output from a pressure transducer [Statham In￾struments, Inc., Oxnard, CA]).
The "experimental" kidney was denervated by autotrans￾plantation to the neck of the same dog by anastomosis to the
carotid artery and jugular vein as described previously (15,
16). The artery to the experimental kidney was encircled by
an electromagnetic flow probe connected to a pulsed-logic
blood flow meter (Biotronex Laboratory, Inc., Kensington,
MD). About 1 in. distal to the flow probe, the artery was
cannulated with an 18-gauge needle to infuse solution I (see
below). A tributary of the jugular vein was cannulated to
obtain samples of renal venous blood. The ureter was can￾nulated and urine flow rate was displayed graphically by a
drop counter (Devices Ltd., London, England) and its vol￾ume measured gravimetrically. The experimental kidney
was placed in a box filled with light liquid paraffin mineral
oil and maintained at 370C by a water jacket. The ureter
of the contralateral kidney was cannulated, but this kidney
was otherwise undisturbed.
Through a cannula inserted into a brachial vein, a solution
of two-thirds 0.154 M NaCl solution and one-third 1.10 M
mannitol was infused at a rate of 0.04 ml min-' kg body
wt-' (solution 2). The markers used to estimate GFR and
renal plasma flow rate (RPF) were added to this infusion.
During surgery, the animals received 500 ml of isooncotic
(6 g 100 ml-'), dextran (average molecular weight 110,000)
in 0.154 M NaCl solution (Dextraven 110, Fisons, Ltd., Lon￾don, England). Infusion I (intrarenal) was delivered at 0.1
ml min-' body wt kg-'. It was initially 0.154 M NaCl so￾lution. 1 h after completing surgery, urine was collected
from each kidney for a 15-min collection period and blood
samples (10-15 ml) were drawn from the femoral artery and
the renal vein at the midpoint. Dextraven 110 was infused
to replace blood losses.
Experimental protocol
Effects of hypertonic intrarenal infusions on renal func￾tion. The infusion into the artery of the experimental kid￾ney was changed from 0.154 M NaCI to either NaCl,
NaHCO3, Na acetate, NH4Cl NH4acetate or dextrose at
1.232 M for 30 min, but the rate of infusion was not changed.
Urine was collected for the last 15 min during which blood
samples were drawn. Thereafter, the infusion was returned
to 0.154 M NaCI solution for a further 30 min and urine was
collected for the last 15 min with a blood sample at the
midpoint.
Effects of prior salt depletion on renal hemodynamics during hypertonic NaCl infusion. In five experiments, the
dogs received furosemide (80 mg d-' with the food) for 2
d to cause ECV depletion. The second dose was given 18 h
before study and no further food or fluid was given. These
dogs received the intrarenal infusions of hypertonic NaCI
according to the protocol described above.
Effects of intraarterial infusions of hypertonic solutions
on femoral blood flow. In four dogs, the hypertonic solu￾tions used in protocol A were infused into a femoral artery
at 0.1 ml min-' kg body wt-'. These infusions were given s for '-15 min with 0.154 M NaCl infused for 15 min between
each one. Femoral blood flow (FBF) was assessed by a non￾cannulating blood flow meter placed around the femoral f
artery at least 1 in. proximal to the site of the infusion.
Laboratory methods
Details of the analytical methods have been described
previously (16). Measurements of Na+ and K+ concentrations
were made with an EEL flame photometer, Cl with a Corn￾ing chloride meter (Corning Medical, Corning Glass Works, Corning, NY), osmol with an Advanced osmometer (Ad- vanced Instruments, Inc., Needham Heights, MA), pH, pco2 and P02 of arterial and renal venous blood with a Radi￾ometer blood gas analyzer (Radiometer Co., Copenhagen, Denmark) and plasma HCO3 calculated from a standard
normogram (Siggaard-Andersen). Hematocrit (Hct) was es￾timated as the mean of two measurements with a micro￾hematocrit centrifuge. Plasma solid concentration (PS; in￾dicating plasma protein concentration) was estimated by dessicating a weighed quantity of plasma to constant weight and reweighing with correction for the measured content
of ions. The radioactivity of arterial and renal venous plasma and urine were counted with a Packard autogamma counter
(Packard Instruments, Inc., Downers Grove, IL). Calculation of results. The RPF was calculated as the
clearance of Hippuran corrected for renal extraction. The
renal blood flow (RBF) was calculated from RPF and Hct.
The electromagnetic flow meter was used to record the time
course of any changes in RBF. The GFR was calculated as
the clearance of EDTA and the filtration fraction (FF) cal￾culated as GFR/RPF. Paired comparisons were used and
values of 2P < 0.05 were taken as statistically significant.
RESULTS
Blood pressure and composition before and during
hypertonic infusions. Table I details the initial values
of MAP and blood composition at the experimental
kidney and the changes produced by the hypertonic
infusions. Since there were no differences in initial
values between groups, the mean starting values were
pooled. The MAP was not altered during any infusion.
The Posmoj at the experimental kidney was increased
-30-45 mosmol. Infusions containing Na+ or Cl- in￾creased PNa or Pci -20-25 mM. Infusion of NaCl,
dextrose and especially NH4Cl produced a systemic
metabolic acidosis; infusions of NaHCO3, and Na ac￾etate produced a systemic metabolic alkalosis. How￾ever, there were no differences between the pH in the
renal vein and the systemic circulation except during
intrarenal infusion of NaHCO3. The systemic plasma
hydrogen ion concentration (PH) was higher during the
infusion of NH4-containing solutions than during the
corresponding Na-containing solutions.
Steady-state changes in RBF, GFR and renal clear￾ance during intrarenal hypertonic infusions. The
renal function of the experimental kidney during the
initial infusion of 0.154 M NaCl and the relationship
of its function to that of the control kidney were
strictly comparable to that reported previously (16).
There were no differences between the RBF, RPF, or
fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) or chloride
(FEc1) between the experimental and control kidneys,

but the GFR and FF were slightly lower (average, 7%;
P < 0.01) at the experimental kidney.
The changes in renal hemodynamics 15-30 min af￾ter starting infusions of the four hypertonic solutions
that did not contain Cl- are shown in Table II. There
were significant increases in RBF and RPF for all save
NH4 acetate. There were no significant changes in
GFR and FF decreased with each infusion. All these
changes in RBF and RPF were reversible, except that
there was a persistent fall in FF after the infusion of
the two acetate-containing solutions. Thus, hypertonic
infusions that did not contain Cl- or NH4' led to re￾versible renal vasodilatation. The changes in renal he￾modynamics that occurred after 15-30 min of infusion
of hypertonic solutions containing Cl- were quite dif￾ferent (Table II). RBF, RPF, and GFR were all re￾duced significantly and these changes were greater
during the infusion of NH4C1 than NaCl (P < 0.05).
The FF was maintained during infusion of NaCl, but
it fell during NH4Cl. These changes (except for the
fall in GFR with NH4Cl) had reversed within 15-30
min after stopping the infusions. Thus, hypertonic Cl￾infusions produced renal vasoconstriction and a fall in
GFR that was more pronounced when NH4+ was the
cation.
In Fig. 1 are shown the percentage changes in RBF
of the experimental kidney alone and relative to the
control kidney during the different infusions. During
the infusion of Na acetate, dextrose, and NaHCO3,
RBF increased, whereas during the infusion of the two
Cl-containing solutions, it decreased. These changes
in RBF were also seen when the RBF of the experi￾mental kidney was expressed as a fraction of its control.
This indicates that the changes in the composition of
blood perfusing the experimental kidney caused the
changes in vascular resistance. However, the magni￾tude of the changes in RBF were generally reduced
when expressed as a fraction of the control-kidney,
indicating that the infusions caused similar, although
smaller, changes in RBF of the control kidneys, pre￾sumably in response to the small changes in compo￾sition of the systemic blood.
There was no significant correlation between the
group mean changes in RBF and changes in PN.
(r = 0.18; n = 6; NS). However, there was a very close
correlation between group mean changes in RBF and
changes in PcI (r = -0.91; n = 6; P < 0.01).
Relationships between changes in RBF and frac￾tional reabsorption of fluid, Na' or Cl-. To examine
the hypothesis that changes in GFR or RBF during
osmotic diuresis are mediated by inhibition of tubular
fluid reabsorption (12-14), the group mean changes
in RBF and GFR produced by the hypertonic infusions
were compared to changes in fractional reabsorption
of fluid (R/FH2O). No significant correlations were ap￾parent between group mean changes in R/FH.O and
either RBF (Fig. 2A) or GFR (r = 0.37; NS).
During osmotic diuresis or during administration of
NH4Cl or hypertonic NaCI administration, there is
considerable inhibition of proximal tubular reabsorp￾tion of fluid, Na+ and Cl- (17-22). Consequently, the
changes in the fractional reabsorption of sodium (R/
FN.) or chloride (R/Fcl) during these infusions indicate
the delivery of filtered Na+ and Cl- to the loop of
Henle. To examine the hypothesis that changes in GFR
or RBF were related to changes in the delivery of

Since all infusions increased Posmoi, yet some led to
renal vasodilatation and others to renal vasoconstric￾tion, it is clear that the steady-state changes in renal
vascular resistance were independent of PoSmol.

there was an increase in RBF without a rise in MAP
indicating renal vasodilatation. However, during the
subsequent 30 min, opposite changes in renal vascular
resistance occurred. Thus, with Na acetate, RBF in￾creased progressively from 220 to 380 ml min-'. In
contrast, with NH4Cl, RBF fell sharply from 480 to

min after stopping the hypertonic infusions. The in￾fusion of Na acetate reduced urine flow rate, whereas
the NH4Cl increased it initially, although by the end
of the infusion when GFR had fallen sharply, urine
flow rate also fell.
The time course of changes in RBF were assessed
from the electromagnetic flow meter records. Per￾centage changes in RBF at 1-2 min and at 30 min
after starting the infusions are shown in Table III.
Within 1-2 min of starting the infusions of the dif￾ferent hypertonic solutions, RBF increased in 45 of 46
experiments. Compared with the 10.3% mean increase
in RBF after 2 min of dextrose infusion, the rise of
35.2% with Na acetate was significantly greater
(P < 0.02), but the early increase in RBF with the other
solutions was not different. Thereafter, RBF increased
further during the infusion of dextrose and NaHCO3;
with Na acetate, the RBF increased further in six of
seven experiments. During NH4acetate, there was a
large initial rise in RBF that returned towards (but not
below) preinfusion values.
The infusion of the two Cl-containing solutions pro￾duced an early increase in RBF that was strictly com￾parable to that seen with the other hypertonic solu￾tions. In contrast, however, in each of the 21 experi￾ments, RBF declined over the period 1-30 min during
the infusion of the Cl-containing solutions. By 30 min,
RBF was reduced significantly below preinfusion lev￾els with both NaCl and NH4Cl; the fall in RBF was
greater with NH4Cl than with NaCl (P < 0.01).
Effects of prior salt depletion on hemodynamic re￾sponse to hypertonic NaCl infusions. The effects of
prior salt and fluid depletion on the renal hemody￾namic response to hypertonic NaCl infusions was as￾sessed by comparing the changes produced by intra￾renal infusion of hypertonic NaCl in 17 "euvolemic"
dogs with those of five "Na-depleted" dogs. As shown
in Table IV, the Na-depleted dogs had a higher FF
and a tendency for a lower RPF before the infusion.

FIGURE 3 Records of two experiments showing the mean RBF recorded with a flow meter,
mean BP and urine drop rate. An intrarenal isotonic NaCl infusion was switched to a 1.232-
M infusion of (a) Na acetate and (b) NH4Cl during the periods shown.
During NaCl infusion, the falls in RBF, RPF, and GFR
in the salt-depleted dogs were more than twice as great
as in the euvolemic dogs, but there were no changes
in FF or blood pressure (BP) in either group. Thus,
salt depletion augmented the renal vasoconstriction
that developed with hypertonic NaCl infusions.
FBF during intraarterial infusions of hypertonic
solutions. In four experiments, the same six hyper￾tonic solutions were infused into the femoral artery.
All six hypertonic solutions led to an abrupt increase
in FBF that was maintained for the 15-min infusion
periods. Since mean BP did not change, femoral vas￾cular resistance declined during the infusion of each
of the solutions.
DISCUSSION
Infusion of hypertonic solutions into the renal artery
caused a biphasic response in renal vascular resistance.
The hyperosmolality invariably led to an abrupt renal
vasodilatation. Acute vasodilatation, in response to
hyperosmolality, is seen at other vessels besides the
kidney (9-11, 23, 24), including the aorta (25), intact
and isolated muscle arteries (26-30), the pulmonary
(31), the mesenteric (10) and the coronary (30), al￾though this response is not always fully maintained
(30). Gazitua et al. (32) contrasted the changes in renal
vascular resistance produced by hypertonic dextrose
and NaCl. As in the present study, they found
that both produced an initial fall in resistance but,
whereas this vasodilatation was maintained during the
3-min infusion of dextrose, vasoconstriction developed
with NaCl. In the present study, only NaHCO3 failed
to elicit a significant early rise in RBF. This may
have been due to alkalosis since this has been shown
to potentiate calcium-activated vascular contraction
(33, 34).
The addition of hypertonic solutions to blood causes
an abrupt shrinkage of erythrocytes that restricts their
deformality and increases the blood viscosity (35, 36).
In the present experiment, however, an increase in
plasma tonicity led to an abrupt reduction in renal
vascular resistance and therefore, changes in blood
viscosity could only have limited the increase in RBF.
Late changes in renal vascular resistance. The
uniform early renal vasodilatation during intrarenal
infusions of various hypertonic solutions was suc￾ceeded by strikingly different patterns of renal vas￾cular resistance that depended on the composition of
the infusate. The infusion of dextrose, NaHCO3, and
Na acetate led to persistent or progressive renal va￾sodilatation; NH4acetate did not change renal vascular
resistance consistently. Thus, hypertonic solutions can
cause a sustained renal vasodilatation regardless of
whether they increase PNa. In marked contrast, in each
of the 21 experiments during which Pc1 was increased,
renal vasoconstriction occurred after the initial vaso￾dilatation.
We showed previously that the degree of renal va￾sodilatation that occurred during more prolonged in￾fusions of hypertonic NaCl was dependent upon the
accompanying metabolic acidosis (9). In the present

series, PH was higher and RBF was lower during the
infusions of the two NH4-containing solutions than
during the infusion of the corresponding Na-contain￾ing solutions. This suggests that the vasoconstriction
occurring with NH4' infusions could be related to
metabolic acidosis (21, 37). The same pattern of
changes in renal vascular resistance was apparent
when the RBF at the experimental kidney was factored
by that at the control kidney. This suggests that the
renal vasoconstriction during the infusion of Cl-con￾taining solutions was related to the local increase
in Pci that was potentiated by an accompanying
rise in PH.
Prior salt depletion doubled the renal vasoconstric￾tion that occurred during intrarenal hypertonic NaCl
infusion. Gerber et al. (10) showed that acute volume
expansion with isotonic saline abolished renal vaso￾constriction during hypertonic NaCl infusions. An un￾controlled salt intake might explain why renal vaso￾constriction was not seen with hypertonic NaCl infu￾sion in one previous study (24). Several other studies
have demonstrated vasoconstriction during infusion of
hypertonic NaCl solutions in intact and isolated kid￾neys (9-11, 32).
The intrarenal infusion of all the hypertonic solu￾tions that did not contain Cl- (except for NH4acetate)
produced an increase in RPF but no significant
changes in GFR; the FF fell in every case indicating
that the renal vasodilatation probably affected afferent
and efferent arterioles (38). In contrast, the GFR was
reduced during the intrarenal infusion of the two Cl￾containing solutions. With NaCl, the fall in GFR was
proportional to the fall in RPF and the FF remained
unchanged, suggesting that the vasoconstriction af￾fected afferent and efferent arterioles. With NH4Cl,
however, the FF fell considerably suggesting an ad￾ditional effect on the glomerular ultrafiltration coef￾ficient (39).
There are several similarities between the Cl-in￾duced fall in RBF and GFR observed in these exper￾iments and the "tubulo-glomerular feedback" mech￾anism identified at the single nephron level and that
is initiated by tubular Cl- reabsorption (8, 40-42).
Some experiments have indicated that tubular fluid
osmolality may also regulate the nephron feedback
response although this remains controversial (4, 43).
"Feedback inhibition" of SNGFR occurs during in￾fusion of hypertonic NaCl but not hypertonic NaHCO3
(44), is augmented by prior dietary salt restriction (45),
and is independent of the nervous system (46). In one
series, feedback inhibition of SNGFR was accompa￾nied by a rise in FF (47) but in a recent study, Ichikawa
has shown that although feedback inhibition of SNGFR
is accompanied by comparable increases in afferent
and efferent arteriolar resistance, the FF falls because
SNGFR is reduced not only by the fall in plasma flow
rate, but also by a large fall in the glomerular capillary
ultrafiltration coefficient (39). In the present series,
sustained renal vasoconstriction was specifically re￾lated to hyperchloremia, was related to Cl- reabsorp￾tion, was initiated by an intrarenal mechanism that
was independent of the nervous system, was poten￾tiated by prior salt depletion, was specific for the kid￾ney, and was accompanied by a fall in GFR. We ob￾served no change in FF during Cl-induced renal va￾soconstriction with NaCl infusion, but a fall in FF
during NH4Cl. The NH4Cl produced a hyperchloremic
acidosis, which has been found to impair proximal tu￾bule Na+-K+ transport (21, 22), leads to enhanced de￾livery of filtrate to the distal nephron (48) and in￾creases UNaV (21, 23, 37). The greater vasoconstriction
apparent with NH4Cl than with NaCl in the present
series and the potentiation of NaCl-induced renal va￾soconstriction by metabolic acidosis observed previ￾ously (49) may be related to inhibition of proximal
fluid reabsorption during metabolic acidosis with a
consequent increase in distal Cl- delivery and poten￾tiation of the feedback response. Thus, the present
studies extend the micropuncture findings to the whole
kidney level, demonstrate the specificity of hyper￾chloremic vasoconstriction for the kidney and indicate
a physiological role for the feedback mechanism in
regulating renal vascular resistance during hyper￾chloremia and metabolic acidosis.
The predominant effects of hypertonic infusions on
salt and water reabsorption should occur in the prox￾imal tubule. In the isolated tubule, an increase in the
NaCl concentration of the perfusate inhibits fluid reab￾sorption (20). In the intact animal, NH4Cl or hyper￾tonic NaCl inhibits proximal reabsorption of fluid, Na+
and Cl- and increases the early distal NaCl concen￾tration (48, 50) whereas hypertonic NaHCO3 decreases
early distal Cl- concentration (51). Thus, infusions of
NH4C1 or NaCl will increase substantially the fraction
of filtrate delivered to the loop of Henle (17, 21, 22).
Accordingly, changes in R/FNa or R/Fc, should indi￾cate changes in distal delivery of filtered Na+ and Cl-.
The changes in RBF and GFR were independent of
changes in R/FNa but were very closely correlated with
changes in R/Fc, (Fig. 2B and 2C), suggesting that
renal vascular resistance was related to the delivery
of Cl-, but not Na+, to the loop of Henle. Nizet found
that the GFR fell during osmotic diuresis or inhibition
of proximal-tubular function but that this was related
to a fall in R/FHo and was independent of Cl- reab￾sorption (12-14). His studies were conducted during
a considerable osmotic diuresis that may have in￾creased the intratubular and intrarenal pressures and
could have led to passive falls in GFR and RBF. In our
studies, the osmotic diuresis was less severe and
Regulation of RBF by Chloride 733

changes in GFR or RBF were independent of
R/FHso (Fig. 2A). Whereas Nizet (12) found that
Na2SO4, but not NaCl, reduced RBF, Sadowski (11)
obtained opposite results using rates of osmolar infu￾sion similar to those in the present experiments. Thus,
the mechanisms identified by Nizet to regulate GFR
and RBF probably operate at high rates of osmotic
diuresis. The present study demonstrates that the reg￾ulation of RBF and GFR by Cl- can override the ef￾fects of hyperosmolality on the renal circulation.
