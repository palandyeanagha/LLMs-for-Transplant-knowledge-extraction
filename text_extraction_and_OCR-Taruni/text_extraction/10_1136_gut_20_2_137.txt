SUMMARY We followed up 55 patients with proven primary biliary cirrhosis for several years or
until death. A graph of the level of serum bilirubin versus time that was constructed for each patient
shows an initial stable period of variable length in which the serum bilirubin level remained con￾stant. This was followed by a period of rapid rise in serum bilirubin which culminated in the patient's
death. Whenever two successive serum bilirubin values taken six months apart exceeded 34 gmol/l
(2.0 mg/dl) the patient had entered a late phase of disease and lived an average of 49 months.
Ninety-five per cent confidence limits on survival time were 32-74 months. If two successive six
month bilirubin values exceeded 102 ,umol/l (6.0 mg/dl), calculated survival time was 25 months,
and if two successive six month bilirubin values exceeded 170 ,umol/l (10.0 mg/dl), survival time was
17 months. Fifteen of the 41 living patients had two consecutive serum bilirubin levels greater than
34 jumol/l (2.0 mg/dl). However, the slope of the rising bilirubin in the living patients is only 25
,umol/l/yr (1.5 mg/dl/yr) compared with 42 ,mol/l/yr (2.5 mg/dl/yr) in the dead patients. This means
that patients with this disease now may be living considerably longer.
Primary biliary cirrhosis is a chronic progressive
liver disease that ultimately kills its victims. Its
pathogenesis is unknown (although antigen- antibody
complexes are thought to play a role) (Thomas et al.,
1977) and various methods of treatment have failed
to show a d.finite lengthening of lifespan. The length
of life after diagnosis, however, is highly variable.
Patients may die rapidly within one year or remain
asymptomatic for many years.
Although pathologically the disease is divided into
four stages (Rubin et al., 1965), these cannot be used
to predict prognosis. Also, no symptom, sign, or
laboratory test has been correlated with length of
life after diagnosis. As a result of our experience with
55 recent cases of primary biliary cirrhosis, we
indicate the potential use of serum bilirubin as a
predictor of prognosis.
Methods
Fifty-five patients with proven primary biliary
cirrhosis were used as the sample, 48 female, seven
male. At the time of diagnosis the patients' ages
Received for publication 8 September 1978
ranged from 26 to 69 years with the median age
being 49 years; the majority (69%) were in their
40s or 50s. The patients were followed up at three to
six month intervals for an average duration of 4-6
years. Fourteen of the patients were followed up
until death, which averaged 6.6 years from. diag￾nosis.
All patients had the following laboratory evalua￾tions: total serum bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase,
alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotrans￾ferase, cholesterol, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase,
immunoelectrophoresis, and mitochondriatantibody..
All patients had unobstructed biliary ducts. demon￾strated by intravenous cholangiography, endosop
retrograde cholangiopancreatography, or operative
cholangiography. No patient had been treated with
any medication which would alter the results of any
of the above tests.
Using a decision rule for indicating the beginning
of a rapid rise in bilirubin associated with death, the
geometric mean survival time was determined under
the assumption of a log-normal survival time distri￾bution (Aitchinson and Brown, 1957). Ninety-five
percent confidence limits on the true mean survival
time for these cohorts were obtained.

Results
PRESENTATION
Most patients (67 %) presented with pruritus or
fatigue or both. Nine patients (16%) had no symp￾toms and were found because of abnormalities in
routine blood chemistry tests performed for other
reasons.
Other modes of presentation included jaundice
(six patients), arthritis (one), Raynaud's pheno￾menon (one), and variceal haemorrhage (one).
Prognosis did not correlate with the mode of presen￾tation.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
Liver size, spleen size, or the initial presence of
jaundice did not correlate with length of life after
diagnosis.
OTHER LABORATORY TEST RESULTS
Eighty percent of the patients (44/55) had positive
immunofluorescence tests for mitochondrial anti￾body. All patients initially had raised activities of
alkaline phosphatase and gamma glutamyl-trans￾peptidase in serum; 87 % (48/55) had initially raised
aminotransferase activity; 54% (30/55) initially had
raised serum cholesterol concentration. None of
these abnormalities correlated with prognosis.
The blood tests were repeated each time the
patient was seen (except mitochondrial antibody)
and changes could not be correlated with length of
life from onset of symptoms or diagnosis.
SERUM BILIRUBIN
At presentation 69 % (38/55) had initial serum
bilirubin concentrations less than or equal to 34
,umol/l (2.0 mg/dl). Twenty-two per cent (12/55)
presented with values between 35 ,umol/l (2-1
mg/dl) and 68 ,umol/l (4-0 mg/dl). The remaining
five patients (9%) had initial serum bilirubin con￾centrations greater than or equal to 69 ,umol/l
(4-1 mg/dl).
Fourteen patients (25%) were followed up until
death, which averaged 6-6 years. Three had initial
serum bilirubin concentrations less than 34 ,umol/l
(2-0 mg/dl) (average time until death was nine
years), seven had values between 35 lsmol/l (2.1
mg/dl) and 68 ,umol/l (4-0 mg/dl) (average time until
death was 6-7 years), and four had initial values
greater than 69 ,umol/l (4.1 mg/dl) (average time
until death was 5-3 years). There was a trend
favouring longevity when initial serum bilirubin
concentrations were under 34 gmol/l (2.0 mg/dl) but
this did not reach significant levels (p > 0.1).
By plotting the values of the repeated serum
bilirubin determinations versus time; a bilirubin
graph was constructed for each patient. These plots
all had an initial stable period of variable length in
which the serum bilirubin remained fairly constant
(usually below 34 gmol/l (2-0 mg/dl). In the living
patients, this time period averaged three years.
After this came a period of rapid rise, in which the
serum bilirubin increased dramatically. It was after
this period of rapid rise that the patients invariably
died. Except for one patient who exsanguinated from
a massive upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage, no
patient died with a serum bilirubin below 204
gmol/l (12 mgd/l).
The important part in each patient's curve was the
change from the flat stable portion to the rapidly
rising portion. Analysis of the data indicated that
the earliest determinant of this change was when two
successive serum bilirubin values, taken at least six
months apart, exceeded 34 ,umol/l (2.0 mg/dl).
Using the occurrence of two successive serum
bilirubin values greater than 34 ,umol/l (2-0 mg/dl)
as an indicator of impending death, the survival time
distribution from this point on was assumed to be
log-normal. Analysis showed the geometric mean
survival time to be 49 months. A 95% confidence
interval for the true mean survival time was calcu￾lated to be 32-74 months (Table).
The above calculation was used for all patients in
the sample. However, we observed that if the first
two serum bilirubin values were both much above
34 umol/l (2.0 mg/dl), the patient was already on the
rapidly rising part of the curve and survival was
shorter. A mean survival time was calculated for two
successive serum bilirubin values greater than 102
gmol/1 (6.0 mg/dl). This equalled 25 months, with a
95 % confidence interval survival time of 19-32
months. When patients had two successive bilirubin
values greater than 170 gmol/l (10-0 mg/dl) esti￾mated survival time was 17 months with a 95%
confidence interval of 13-22 months (Table).

for the dead patients. Most of these patients pre￾sented already jaundiced, so no stable period is
shown, only the phase of rising serum bilirubin,
which averaged 42 tmol/l/yr (2.5 mg/dl/yr). The
graphs differ, with the slope of the curve for the
deceased patients greater than the slope for the live
ones. It now is taking the serum bilirubin longer
to rise from 34 ,umol/l (2.0 mg/dl) to 170 ,umol/l (10
mg/dl) and thus living patients will live longer.
Discussion
Death in primary biliary cirrhosis usually results
from hepatic insufficiency, portal hypertension with
resultant variceal haemorrhage, or sepsis. The
survival time from diagnosis until death is highly
variable. To define an approximate lifespan for
these patients would be important.
Of the 55 patients with proven primary biliary
cirrhosis whom we have been following up for long
periods of time, 14 have died with an average time
from diagnosis of 6.6 years. The behaviour in each
patient of serum bilirubin versus time is surpris￾ingly uniform. The usually normal initial serum
bilirubin values remain constant for several years.
This is followed by a phase of rapid increase in serum
bilirubin which invariably culminates in the patient's
death; patients rarely die of their disease before this
rapid rise. The change in slope of the bilirubin curve
is marked by two successive bilirubin values ex￾ceeding 34 ,umol/l (2.0 mg/dl).
We believe that this change in serum bilirubin
that occurs while the patient is being followed up is
an indication of the length of time that the patient
will survive. Using these changes in serum bilirubin
we have defined a prediction which states that when
two successive serum bilirubin values taken six
months apart both exceed 34 umol/l (2.0 mg/dl), the
patient has entered a late phase of the disease. Once
this has happened the patients lived an average of
four years with a range of three to six years.
When two successive serum bilirubin values ex￾cedeed 102 gmol/l (6.0 mg/dl) expected life was
shortened to 1.5 to 2.5 years with an average of two
years. With two successive bilirubin values greater
than 170 ,umol/l (10 mg/dl), lifespan for these
patients was further shortened, averaging less than
1.5 years.
One possible explanation of why the change in
serum bilirubin correlates with survival relates to
copper. Because of the damage to the bile ducts the
liver is unable to excrete the normal amount of
bile. Copper is absorbed from the gastrointestinal
tract and 80% of it is excreted in the bile (Cartwright
and Wintrobe, 1964). The normal route of excretion
becomes blocked in primary biliary cirrhosis and the
amount of copper increases in the hepatic paren￾chyma (Hunt et al., 1963). Copper is hepatotoxic in

both man (Chuttani et al., 1965; Sternlieb, 1972) and
experimental animals (Todd et al., 1962). The
accumulation of copper in the liver may be respon￾sible for the rapid final deterioration of patients with
primary biliary cirrhosis. The early promising results
using D-penicillamine, a copper chelating agent, in
treating patients with primary biliary cirrhosis
support this hypothesis (Deering et al., 1977;
Jain et al., 1977). This drug decreases hepatic copper
levels (Deering et al., 1977) but whether it will pro￾long life is not established.
The prognostic sign we have proposed needs to be
verified by following up more patients with primary
biliary cirrhosis from the very early stages of the
disease to death. The application of this rule to 41
living patients presently being followed up indicates
that 39 % (15 patients) are in imminent danger. The
average time between diagnosis and the change in
serum bilirubin for these patients was three years.
This differs from that in the dead patients whose
initial serum bilirubin averaged 51 umol/l (3 mg/dl).
The combined plots of both groups are seen in
Figs 1 and 2. The other difference is that the slope of
the bilirubin curve rises less steeply in the living
patients than in the dead ones-25 gmol/l/yr
(1.5 mg/dl/yr) as compared with 42 ,gmol/l/yr
(2.5 mg/dl/yr). This observation means that survival
is greatly increasing even after the late or jaundiced
phase of the disease has begun, possibly because
supportive therapy has improved. The extrapolated
duration of the accelerated phase is 51 years until
the serum bilirubin reaches 170 ,umol/l (10 mg/dl)
and therefore our expected survival for the living
patients just entering this phase is approximately
seven years.
