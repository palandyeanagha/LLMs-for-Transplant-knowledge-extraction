Although both extrinsic and intrinsic factors have been identified that orchestrate the differentiation and maturation of oligodendro￾cytes, less is known about the intracellular signaling pathways that control the overall commitment to differentiate. Here, we provide
evidence that activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is essential for oligodendrocyte differentiation. Specifically,
mTOR regulates oligodendrocyte differentiation atthe late progenitorto immature oligodendrocytetransition as assessed bythe expres￾sion of stage specific antigens and myelin proteins including MBP and PLP. Furthermore, phosphorylation of mTOR on Ser 2448
correlates with myelination in the subcortical white matter of the developing brain. We demonstrate that mTOR exerts its effects on
oligodendrocyte differentiationthroughtwo distinct signaling complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, defined bythe presence ofthe adaptor
proteins raptor and rictor, respectively. Disrupting mTOR complex formation via siRNA mediated knockdown of raptor or rictor signif￾icantly reduced myelin protein expression in vitro. However, mTORC2 alone controlled myelin gene expression at the mRNA level,
whereas mTORC1 influenced MBP expression via an alternative mechanism. In addition, investigation of mTORC1 and mTORC2 targets
revealed differential phosphorylation during oligodendrocyte differentiation. In OPC-DRG cocultures, inhibiting mTOR potently abro￾gated oligodendrocyte differentiation and reduced numbers of myelin segments. These data supportthe hypothesisthat mTOR regulates
commitment to oligodendrocyte differentiation before myelination.
Introduction
The differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs)
into mature oligodendrocytes is a complex process that requires
cell cycle exit and the coordinate expression of genes required for
maturation and myelination. Whereas several transcription fac￾tors have been identified that are essential for OPC differentia￾tion, intermediate signaling pathways that link external regula￾tors with the transcription factors that promote the transition
from a progenitor to a myelinating oligodendrocyte remain
unclear.
Several studies suggest that the PI3K/Akt pathway, which is
activated by growth factors and extracellular matrix (ECM) mol￾ecules, promotes oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelina￾tion. For example, deletion of the endopeptidase BACE1 in mice
causes hypomyelination because of the improper cleavage of neu￾regulin, which in turn leads to decreased phosphorylation of Akt
(Hu et al., 2006). Insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I, which pro￾motes sustained Akt phosphorylation in oligodendroglia (Ness
andWood, 2002), also has an essential role in CNS myelination in
vivo. IGF-I overexpression in mice causes CNS hypermyelination
(Carson et al., 1993). Conversely, genetic deletion of IGF-I sys￾temically (Beck et al., 1995; Ye et al., 2002) or of the IGF-IR in
OPCs (Zeger et al., 2007) results in decreased numbers of oligo￾dendrocytes and myelin. In a similar manner, laminin-2 pro￾motes myelin formation both in vitro and in vivo via a mechanism
that is sensitive to pharmacological inhibition of the PI3K/Akt
pathway and can be abrogated by a dominant-negative Akt mu￾tant (Chun et al., 2003). Direct evidence implicating Akt signal￾ing in OPC maturation derives from studies using targeted ex￾pression of a constitutive active Akt mutant in the
oligodendrocyte lineage that stimulates premature and enhanced
myelination of the CNS in the absence of an increased number of
OPCs (Flores et al., 2008). Despite the evidence that Akt is in￾volved in OPC maturation, the downstream targets of Akt that
promote oligodendrocyte development are unknown.
The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a serine￾threonine kinase that functions as a key regulator of cell growth in
response to PI3K/Akt stimulation and nutrient sensing. mTOR
forms two distinct signaling complexes, termed mTORC1 and
mTORC2, defined by its association with the adaptor proteins
raptor or rictor, which regulate kinase specificity toward distinct
downstream targets. mTORC1 is best characterized for its ability
to regulate cell growth and protein translation via the phosphor￾ylation of p70S6K1 and 4E-BPs (Kim et al., 2002; Hay and Sonen￾berg, 2004). Recently, mTORC2 was identified as the critical ki￾Received Jan. 15, 2009; revised March 22, 2009; accepted March 27, 2009.

nase for Akt Ser 473 phosphorylation (Sarbassov et al., 2005,
2006). mTORC2 also regulates the organization of the actin cy￾toskeleton in part by modulating the activity of PKC- (Sar￾bassov et al., 2004). Together, these studies demonstrate that
mTOR functions both as a signaling effector in response to PI3K/
Akt signaling, as well as a key modulator of Akt activity via
mTORC2.
In this study, we demonstrate that mTOR is essential for oli￾godendrocyte differentiation. mTOR is activated during OPC
differentiation in vivo and in vitro, and inhibiting mTOR arrests
oligodendrocyte differentiation at the late progenitor stage. Fi￾nally, we provide evidence that mTORC1 and mTORC2 promote
oligodendrocyte differentiation through distinct mechanisms.

Primary cortical oligodendrocyte progenitor cultures and differentiation
paradigm. All animal experimentation protocols were approved by the
University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey (UMDNJ) and Rut￾gers Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) and were
conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health guide￾lines for the care and use of laboratory animals. OPCs were purified from
cortical mixed glial cultures by established methods (McCarthy and de
Vellis, 1980). Briefly, brains were removed from postnatal day 0 –2
Sprague Dawley rat pups and the cortices were dissected. Cortical pieces
were enzymatically digested in 2.5% trypsin and Dnase I followed by
mechanical dissociation. Cells were resuspended in MEM-C, which con￾sists of minimal essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% FBS,
L-glutamine, and 1% Pen-strep, and plated onto T75 flasks. The resulting
mixed glial cultures were maintained for 10 d. Purified OPC cultures
were prepared by a differential shake (McCarthy and de Vellis, 1980).
Purified OPCs were seeded onto poly-D-lysine-coated T75 flasks at a
density of 2  104 cells/cm2 in a chemically defined medium (N2S). N2S
consists of 66% N2B2 (DMEM/F12 supplemented with 0.66 mg/ml BSA,
10 ng/ml D-biotin, 5 g/ml insulin, 20 nM progesterone, 100 M pu￾trescine, 5 ng/ml selenium, 50 g/ml apo-transferrin, 100 U/ml penicil￾lin, 100 g/ml streptomycin, and 0.5% FBS) supplemented with 34%
B104 conditioned media, 5 ng/ml FGF, and 0.5% FBS. Purified OPCs
were amplified for 4 –10 d in N2S, passaged once with papain, and plated
for experiments.
To initiate OPC differentiation, we followed an established mitogen
withdrawal protocol (Tokumoto et al., 1999). Briefly, OPCs were seeded
onto poly-D-lysine-coated dishes or round 12 mm poly-D-lysine/
laminin-coated cover-glass at a density of 2  104 cells/cm2 in N2S media
and allowed to recover overnight. The following day, N2S media were
replaced with mitogen free N2B2 media supplemented with 30 ng/ml
triiodothyronine (T3). For rapamycin treatments, a stock solution of
rapamycin resuspended in ethanol was diluted into N2B2T3 to a final
concentration of 15 nM. Control cultures received vehicle alone (0.002%
ethanol). N2B2T3 differentiation media with or without rapamycin
was replenished every 48 h during the course of experiments.
Immunocytochemistry and in vitro quantification. Purified OPCs were
plated onto round 12 mm poly-D-lysine/laminin-coated coverglass in
N2S media at a density of 2  104 cells/cm2 and allowed to recover
overnight. The following day, differentiation in the presence or absence
of rapamycin at the indicated doses was initiated by mitogen withdrawal
in N2B2T3 differentiation media. After 1, 2, 3.5, or 5 d of differentia￾tion, the coverslips were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 8 min
followed by three washes in PBS. A blocking step was performed by
incubating the coverslips in diluent (PBS containing 10% fetal calf serum
and 10% lamb serum) for 15 min. Detection of R24, O4, and GalC cell
surface antigens was performed by diluting supernatant from the R24
hybridoma, O4 hybridoma, and Ranscht hybridoma 1:2, 1:3, and 1:2
respectively in diluent and added to the coverslips for 45 min at room
temperature. Coverslips were washed again in PBS and incubated in
diluent containing 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride
(DAPI; 1:1000), goat anti-mouse-IgM fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC;
1:500), and goat anti-mouse-IgG3 tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate
(TRITC; 1:250) secondary antibodies for 45 min to detect O4 and GalC
or R24 respectively. Finally, coverslips were washed 3 times in PBS and
mounted on superfrost slides with Aquamount containing 2.5%
DABCO. To detect PLP, cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton
X-100 for 4 min after fixation in 2% paraformaldehyde. The anti-PLP
antibody (Millipore Bioscience Research Reagents) was diluted 1:100 in
diluent and incubated as described above, followed by incubation with
goat anti-mouse-IgG FITC secondary antibodies.
To quantify the number of O4 /GalC  immature oligodendrocytes
present in our cultures after 3.5 and 5 d of differentiation, cell counts
were performed on a minimum of 6 independent fields (2 fields/3 cov￾erslips/treatment) of photomicrographs captured with a 20 objective.
Total counts of O4- and GalC-immunoreactive cells were performed,
and the number of immature oligodendrocytes per culture was expressed
as the percentage of GalC  cells to total O4  cells.
Transfection of siRNA smart pools. For siRNA smart pool transfections,
5  106 OPCs were collected and resuspended in 100 l of rat oligoden￾drocyte nucleofector solution (Amaxa). Control, mTOR, rictor, or rap￾tor targeting siRNA smart pools (200 pmols) were added to the cell
suspension and transferred to an Amaxa certified cuvette. Cells were
electroporated with the Amaxa nucleofection device using a protocol,
O-17, optimized for the transfection of primary rat oligodendrocytes.
After electroporation, cells were resuspended in N2S media and plated
on poly-D-lysine-coated dishes. Cells were allowed to attach and recover
overnight in N2S media. The following day, differentiation was initiated
in N2B2T3 media, and cells were cultured for 4 or 5 d before protein
isolation.
Protein isolation and Western immunoblotting. After treatments, cells
were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and total cell lysates were harvested
in 2 SDS lysis buffer [125 mM Tris-HCl, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 100 mM
DTT, 1/50 protease inhibitor (PI) cocktail (Sigma)]. The lysates were
briefly sonicated and stored at 80°C before Western analysis. The
RC-DC protein assay (Bio-Rad) was performed to determine protein
concentration. 15 g of total protein per sample was aliquoted, boiled
for 5 min and separated by SDS-PAGE on Bis-Tris mini-gels (Invitro￾gen). Separated proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose mem￾branes and blocked in 5% milk/TBS-0.1% Tween for 1 h at room tem￾perature. Membranes were then incubated in the presence of primary
antibodies diluted in 5% milk/TBS-0.1% Tween overnight at 4°C. The
following day, membranes were washed 3 times for 5 min with TBS-0.1%
Tween and incubated for 1 h atroom temperature in 5% milk/TBS-0.1%
Tween containing goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse secondary anti￾bodies at a dilution of 1:5000. The detection of HRP conjugated second￾ary antibodies was performed by enhanced chemiluminescence using the
Ultra-LUM imaging device. Protein expression levels were quantified
using NIH Image 1.62.
RNA isolation and qPCR analysis. For RNA isolation, primary rat
OPCs were seeded onto poly-D-lysine-coated 150 mm dishes in N2S
media at a density of 2  104 cells/cm2
. The following day, differentia￾tion was initiated in the presence or absence of 15 nM rapamycin in

N2B2T3 differentiation media. On day 3 of differentiation, cells were
washed twice in PBS, harvested in 500 l of PBS, and pelleted by centrif￾ugation at 10,000  g for 10 min. The supernatant was aspirated and cell
pellets were stored at 80°C before RNA isolation.
Frozen cell pellets were briefly thawed on ice and resuspended in 1 ml
of Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). Total RNA was extracted following the
TRIZOLisolation protocol. Precipitated totalRNAwas resuspendedin 50l
of nuclease free water and stored at 80°C. RNA concentration was mea￾sured using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). One mi￾crogram of total RNA was treated with Dnase I (Invitrogen) and used to
generate cDNA. First strand cDNA was synthesized using Superscript III
reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Concentrations of cDNA were deter￾mined by spectrophotometry and stored at 20°C before qPCR analysis.
For qPCRs, 150 ng of cDNA was used as template in each reaction
containing 1 SYBR green detection master mix and 1 QuantiTect
primer mix to detect the mRNA expression levels of MBP, PLP, Ugt-8,
Sox10, Olig2, Nkx2.2, Tcf4, Id2, or Id4 (Qiagen). Amplification levels
were normalized to expression levels of -actin for each sample. The
qPCRs were performed on the Applied Biosystems 7900HT Fast Real￾time PCR system using associated Sequence Detection Systems Software
Version 2.2.2 (SDS2.2.2). The thermal reaction profiles for the PCRs
were performed as follows: 50°C for 2 min, 9°C for 10 min, 40 cycles of
95°C for 15 s, and 58°C for 1 min.
Coimmunoprecipitations of mTORC1 and mTORC2 complexes. Pri￾mary rat OPCs were plated on poly-D-lysine-coated 100 mm dishes in
N2S media. The following day, differentiation was initiated by mitogen
withdrawal in N2B2T3 differentiation media in the presence or ab￾sence of 15 nM rapamycin. On days 1 and 2 of differentiation, cells were
washed twice with cold PBS, harvested in 500 l of PBS, and pelleted by
centrifugation at 10,000  g for 5 min at 4°C. Cells from (6) 100 mm
dishes were pooled for each treatment group. Cell pellets were resus￾pended and lysed in 1 ml of immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer for 30 min
on ice. IP buffer was composed of 40 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 120 mM NaCl,
1 mM EDTA, 10 mM pyrophosphate, 50 mM NaF, 0.5 mM orthovanadate,
protease inhibitors, and 1% Triton X-100. A portion of the lysate was
used to determine protein concentration by the DC protein assay (Bio￾Rad). A total of 600 g of protein was used for each immunoprecipita￾tion per treatment group. The lysates were precleared by incubation with
30 l of protein A/G agarose at 4°C followed by centrifugation at
10,000  g for 5 min. Primary antibodies to mTOR (2 g total) were
added to the supernatants and incubated with gentle rotation overnight
at 4°C. The following day 30 l of protein A/G agarose beads was added
to the lysates and incubated for 4 h. Immune complexes were precipi￾tated by centrifugation at 8000  g for 5 min and washed three times with
ice-cold IP buffer. Immune complexes were resuspended in 30 l of 1
SDS lysis buffer and boiled for 5 min. Samples were separated on 3– 8%
Tris-acetate gels by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes
that were subsequently probed with antibodies to detect mTOR, raptor,
and rictor.
Delayed addition of rapamycin. Primary rat OPCs were plated on
round 12 mm poly-D-lysine/laminin-coated coverslips in 24 well dishes
in N2S media at a density of 2  104 cells/cm2
. The following day,
differentiation was initiated by the addition of N2B2T3 differentiation
media with or without 15 nM rapamycin. A total volume of 600 l of
media was added to each well. For delayed treatments, a 10 stock of
rapamycin or vehicle alone was prepared in DMEM/F12 that was diluted
directly into the media on 1, 2, 3, or 4 d of differentiation to achieve a final
concentration of 15 nM rapamycin. The media for each treatment group
were replenished every 48 h for the duration of the experiment. On day 5
of differentiation, coverslips were washed 3 times in PBS and prepared
for the immunocytochemical detection of O4 and GalC cell surface an￾tigens as described. Total numbers of GalC-positive immature oligoden￾drocytes were quantified as described in previous experiments.
IHC detection of p-mTOR Ser 2448 in vivo. For developmental analyses
of mTOR Ser 2448 phosphorylation in vivo, postnatal day 14, 18, and 21
rat pup littermates were anesthetized via IP injection of a 3:1 mixture of
ketamine and xylazine. Brains were fixed by transcardiac perfusion with
3% paraformaldehyde and extracted. Extracted brains were further im￾mersed in 3% paraformaldehyde for 4 h at 4°C. Brains were blocked in a
coronal plane, placed in tissue cassettes, and stored in 70% ethanol before
paraffin embedding. A total of 20 5 m sections, two per slide, were
prepared from each paraffin embedded tissue sample.
For IHC detection, sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated
through ethanols. Sections were then incubated in 3% hydrogen perox￾ide in methanol for 10 min at room temperature and rinsed several times
with Tris buffered saline (TBS). Antigen retrieval was performed by in￾cubation in proteinase K (5 g/ml) in 10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, for 10 min at
37°C. Next, the sections were rinsed in TBS and permeabilized in 0.3%
Triton X-100 in TBS for 30 min at room temperature. Sections were then
blocked in TGB superblock (0.5 M Tris PH 7.6, 10% BSA, 10% goat
serum, 0.05% NaN3) for 1 h at room temperature. Primary antibodies to
p-mTOR Ser 2448 (Cell Signaling; 1:250) were diluted in TGB diluent
(0.5 M TBS, 20% TGB superblock, and 0.2% Triton X-100) and incubated
overnight in a humid chamber at 4°C. The following day, sections were
washed and incubated in TGB diluent containing Goat anti-Rabbit bio￾tinylated secondary antibodies for 2 h at 37°C. Next, the sections were
washed and incubated in streptavidin-HRP in TBS plus 10% bovine
serum 2 h at 37°C. HRP detection was visualized with NovaRed substrate
(Vector Labs). Sections were briefly counterstained with hematoxylin,
dehydrated, and coverslipped with cytoseal mounting medium. Pho￾tomicrographs of each section were captured using a 20 objective.
Dorsal root ganglion neuron-OPC cocultures. Dorsal root ganglion
(DRG) neurons were dissected from E14.5-E16.5 rat embryos and were
dissociated in 0.25% trypsin (Invitrogen) for 30 min at 37°C. The disso￾ciated DRGs were plated onto 12 mm glass coverslips coated with growth
factor reduced Matrigel (1:10 dilution; Invitrogen) (1 DRG/coverslip) in
DMEM (Mediatech) and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Mediatech)
supplemented with 50 ng/ml nerve growth factor (NGF) (Harlan) in a
140 l droplet. To remove the proliferating non-neuronal cells, 6 – 8 h
after plating, the cultures were flooded in DMEM with 10% FBS supple￾mented with 50 ng/ml NGF containing 15 M fluorodeoxyuridine
(FUdR). Two days later, the media were replaced with Neurobasal me￾dium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2% B27 supplement mixture (In￾vitrogen) containing 10M FUdR. FUdR was removed from the medium
after an additional 2 d and cultures were maintained in Neurobasal me￾dium with the supplements for 2 d before switching to DMEM and 10%
FBS supplemented with 50 ng/ml NGF. Cultures were maintained under
the same condition for another 4 –5 d with the media changed every 2 d.
OPCs were purified from mixed glial cortical cultures as described
above. The OPCs were trypsinized and plated onto DRG neurons at a
density of 350,000 – 400,000 cells/coverslip in DMEM and 10% FBS sup￾plemented with 50 ng/ml NGF. Media were changed every 2 d and oli￾godendrocyte differentiation and myelination in the cocultures were as￾sessed on day 7 or day 18. After immunostaining, images from 30
random fields/coverslip were taken using a 60 objective. From each
image, the numbers of MBP-positive myelin segments, MBP-positive
oligodendrocytes, and DAPI-positive cells were determined. The level of
myelination was determined as total number of MBP-positive segments
as a percentage of total number of DAPI-positive cells per field. Differ￾entiation of oligodendrocytes was quantified by total number of MBP￾positive oligodendrocytes as a percentage of total number of DAPI￾positive cells.
Neurosphere preparation and differentiation. Normal Wistar pups
[postnatal day 2–7 (P2–P7)] were killed by decapitation and their brains
removed using aseptic techniques. The subventricular zones (SVZs) were
isolated and placed in dishes containing PGM solution (PBS with 1 mM
MgCl2 and 0.6% dextrose), where the SVZ was mechanically minced.
The pieces of tissue were collected and incubated in 0.05% trypsin solu￾tion at 37°C for 5 min. The tissue was dissociated in Pro-N media
(DMEM/F12 media containing 10 ng/ml D-biotin, 25 g/ml insulin, 6.29
ng/ml progesterone, 16.11g/ml putrescine, 5 ng/ml selenium, 50g/ml
apo-transferrin; Sigma Aldrich), 50 g/ml gentamycin (Invitrogen) us￾ing micropipettes. The cell suspension was then passed through a 40 m
Nitex screen to ensure an even single cell suspension and cells were
collected by centrifugation at 200  g for 5 min. The media were removed
and replaced with 10 ml of fresh media and the process repeated 3 times
to remove tissue debris. The number of viable cells was determined with
a hemocytometer by exclusion of 0.1% Trypan Blue dye. The cells were

then plated into 12-well tissue culture plastic
plates (BD Biosciences) at a density of 1  105
cells/ml in Pro-N media supplemented with 20
ng/ml EGF (R&D Systems) and 10 ng/ml FGF-2
(R&D Systems). Cell cultures were fed every 2
to 3 d. After 6 –7 d, the primary neurospheres
were collected and passaged to form secondary
neurospheres. Neurospheres were collected and
centrifuged at 200 g for 5 min. The media was
removed, replaced with Accutase (Innovative
Cell Technology) and incubated at 37°C for 5
min. The spheres were dissociated in Pro-N me￾dia using micropipettes. The cell suspension was
then passed through a 40 m Nitex screen and
cells were collected by centrifugation at 200  g
for 5 min. The media were removed and replaced
with 10ml offreshmedia and the process repeated
3 times. Viable cells were then plated into 60 mm
dishes (BD Biosciences) at a density of 1  105
cells/ml in 50/50 mixture of Pro-N media supple￾mented with 20 ng/ml EGF (R&D Systems) and
10 ng/ml FGF-2 (Alomone Labs, Israel) and neu￾rosphere conditioned Pro-N media. Cell cultures
were fed every 2 d. This protocol has been previ￾ously shown to yield NSPs (Felling et al., 2006).
For differentiation experiments, secondary
neurospheres were cultured for 10 d before be￾ing dissociated to ensure large neurospheres
that would contain neural progenitors. Neuro￾spheres were collected and centrifuged at 200 g
for 5 min. The media were removed, replaced
with Accutase (Innovative Cell Technology)
and incubated at 37°C for 5 min. The spheres
were dissociated in Pro-N media using mi￾cropipettes. The cell suspension was then passed through a 40 m Nitex
screen and cells were collected by centrifugation at 200 g for 5 min. The
media were removed and replaced with 10 ml of fresh media and the
process repeated three times. Viable cells were then plated into either 60
mm dishes (BD Biosciences) or chamber slides pretreated with poly-D￾lysine (20 g/ml)/laminin (10 g/ml) at a density of 5  105 cells/ml.
Secondary neurospheres were cultured in either N2B3 media or N2B3
media supplemented with 10 nM rapamycin for 7 d in vitro to allow for
complete differentiation. The cells were fed every second day.
Results
Phosphorylation of mTOR Ser 2448 correlates with
myelination in vivo
In response to PI3K/Akt stimulation, mTOR is phosphorylated
on serine 2448, which correlates with increased kinase activity
(Sekulic´ et al., 2000; Choe et al., 2003; Holz and Blenis, 2005). To
determine whether mTOR is active during OPC differentiation in
vivo, we detected phosphorylated mTOR on Ser 2448 by per￾forming IHC on the subcortical white matter (WM) during post￾natal rat CNS development (Fig. 1). p-mTOR Ser 2448 was ap￾parent in WM by postnatal day 14 (Fig. 1A), became more
abundant in subcortical and striatal WM by postnatal day 18 (Fig.
1B) and further intensified through day 21 (Fig. 1C). Thus,
mTOR phosphorylation increased as myelination peaked in the
forebrain (Hamano et al., 1996). In addition, p-mTOR is de￾tected in rows of interfascicular oligodendrocytes in the corpus
callosum and in MBP  cells (Fig. 1D,F), but is not detected in
GFAP  astrocytes (Fig. 1G).

Oligodendrocyte differentiation is characterized in part by the
transition from a simple bipolar morphology to a complex
branched morphology. To determine whether mTOR regulates
the morphological progression of OPCs during differentiation in
vitro, we examined cultures of OPCs by phase contrast micros￾copy. After 2 d of differentiation, control and rapamycin treated
cells displayed increased branching compared with undifferenti￾ated early progenitors (Fig. 2A,B). Control cultures contained a
mixed population of simple branched cells, characteristic of
O4 /GalC  late progenitors, as well as complex multipolar oli￾godendrocytes which extended an elaborate network of lacy pro￾cesses (Fig. 2A). However, very few complex multipolar oligo￾dendrocytes were observed in rapamycin treated cultures (Fig.
2B). Instead, rapamycin treated cells exhibited a simple multipo￾lar morphology characteristic of the late progenitor stage of
differentiation.
mTOR is required for the appearance of GalC 
oligodendrocytes in vitro
To determine directly whether inhibiting mTOR prevents oligo￾dendrocyte differentiation past the late progenitor stage, we per￾formed immunocytochemistry for the stage-specific cell surface
antigens O4 and GalC. Cortical OPC cultures were cultured in
the absence of mitogens  15 nM rapamycin for 3.5 d, and the
total numbers of O4 /GalC  late progenitors and O4 /GalC 
immature oligodendrocytes were quantified. Control and rapa￾mycin treated OPCs gained the expression of O4 by 3.5 d (Fig.
2E,F). In addition, 30% of cells in control cultures were iden￾tified as GalC  immature oligodendrocytes (Fig. 2C,G). How￾ever, inhibiting mTOR with rapamycin caused a significant re￾duction in the number of GalC  cells (1%, p  0.0001) (Fig.
2D,G), effectively blocking the progression of OPC differentia￾tion at the late progenitor stage.
To demonstrate that rapamycin blocked rather than delayed
differentiation, we repeated immunocytochemistry for O4 and

GalC after 5 d of differentiation. On day 5 of differentiation,
50% of the OPCs in control cultures reached the GalC  imma￾ture oligodendrocyte stage (Fig. 2H). However, 10% of the
OPCs treated with 15 nM rapamycin progressed past the late pro￾genitor stage (Fig. 2H) ( p  0.0001). In addition, we performed
a dose–response to determine the sensitivity of the transition to
the O4 /GalC  immature oligodendrocyte stage to mTOR in￾hibition. Doses of rapamycin as low as 0.15 nM caused a 28%
reduction ( p  0.0001) in the number of OPCs that progressed
past the O4 /GalC  late progenitor stage (Fig. 2H).
To demonstrate that inhibiting mTOR has no effect on early
stages of OPC differentiation, we performed immunocytochem￾istry for R24, which labels early progeni￾tors, and O4 after 1 and 2 d of differentia￾tion  15 nM rapamycin. The percentages
of R24  early progenitors and O4  late
progenitors were quantified. Rapamycin
had no effect on the numbers of R24  or
O4  cells in the cultures on day 1 (supple￾mental Fig. 1A–C, available at www.
jneurosci.org as supplemental material) or
day 2 of differentiation (supplemental Fig.
1D–F, available at www.jneurosci.org as
supplemental material).
mTOR regulates the expression of
myelin proteins MBP and PLP
To provide further evidence that mTOR
activation is required for OPCs to progress
past the late progenitor stage, we examined
the expression of MBP and PLP. By 5 d of
differentiation, a significant number of
PLP-positive oligodendrocytes were
present in control cultures (Fig. 3A,C).
However, inhibiting mTOR completely
blocked the acquisition of PLP (Fig. 3B,D).
Western blot analysis of MBP expression
during a differentiation time course
showed a robust increase in MBP expres￾sion in control cultures after 4 d of differ￾entiation that was completely abrogated
by mTOR inhibition (Fig. 3E).
Although rapamycin is a specific inhib￾itor of mTOR, we performed siRNA medi￾ated knockdown of mTOR expression to
independently confirm that the effects of
rapamycin on OPC differentiation were a
result of inhibiting mTOR activity. OPCs
were transiently transfected with either a
control or mTOR-targeting siRNA smart
pool. One day after transfection, the cells
were cultured for 4 d in differentiation me￾dium and levels of MBP expression were
quantified as an index of differentiation.
In cultures transfected with control siR￾NAs, marked MBP expression was appar￾ent by 4 d of differentiation (Fig. 3F). In
contrast, transfection with a siRNA smart
pool targeting mTOR inhibited MBP ex￾pression (Fig. 3F).
mTOR regulates mRNA expression of
myelin genes
Our previous studies demonstrated that inhibiting mTOR signif￾icantly reduced protein levels of MBP and PLP. To gain insight
into the mechanisms by which mTOR regulates myelin protein
expression, we measured MBP and PLP mRNA levels by quanti￾tative PCR. A previous report showed that the mRNA levels for
MBP and PLP are at or near peak levels by 3 d of differentiation in
vitro (Dugas et al., 2006). Thus, total RNA isolated from control
and rapamycin treated cultures after 3 d of differentiation was
used to generate cDNA that was subjected to a validated Quanti￾Tect primer assay (Qiagen) for MBP and PLP. Inhibiting mTOR
by rapamycin resulted in an 84% and 64% reduction in MBP and
PLP mRNA levels, respectively (Fig. 3G) (MBP, p  0.0032; PLP,

(data not shown).
In addition, we measured the mRNA levels of UDP glycosyl￾transferase 8 (Ugt-8) after 3 d of differentiation in the presence or
absence of rapamycin. Ugt-8 catalyzes the final step in the bio￾synthesis of cerebrosides (Koul et al., 1980), a major component
of myelin membranes, and also is upregulated during oligoden￾drocyte differentiation (Dugas et al., 2006). Inhibiting mTOR
decreased Ugt-8 mRNA by 58% after 3 d of differentiation (Fig.
3G) ( p  0.0014).
CNPase expression but not Tuj1 or GFAP expression
decreases in the presence of rapamycin
To determine whether mTOR participates in the differentiation
of neurons and astrocytes, we added rapamycin during the dif￾ferentiation of neural stem/progenitor (NSP) cells dissociated
from neonatal SVZ-derived neurospheres. After 7 d of differen￾tiation, CNPase expression was decreased whereas neither Tuj1
nor GFAP were altered (supplemental Fig. 2A–C, available at
www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). Consistent with
the reduction in CNPase, immunostaining for O1 was similarly

reduced in the NSPs differentiated in the presence of rapamycin
compared with controls (supplemental Fig. 2D,E, available at
www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material).
Inhibiting mTOR has no effect on OPC cell number
during differentiation
To determine whether inhibiting mTOR altered cell survival, we
quantified the total numbers of cells after 3.5 and 5 d of differen￾tiation in the presence or absence of rapamycin.We used O4 as an
index of cell number since all of the cells in our cultures acquired
O4 expression by these time points. After 3.5 and 5 d of differen￾tiation, we observed no change in the total number of cells in
cultures treated with rapamycin versus control cultures (supple￾mental Fig. 3A,B, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemen￾tal material).
To further evaluate cell viability, we measured changes in the
level of active caspase-3 during a time course of differentiation.
Inhibiting mTOR did not increase levels of active caspase-3 at any
time point (supplemental Fig. 3C,D, available at www.jneurosci.org
as supplemental material). In fact, rapamycin treatment caused
a significant reduction in the levels of active caspase-3 after
2 d of differentiation (supplemental Fig. 3D, available at www.
jneurosci.org as supplemental material) ( p  0.0375).
We also asked whether the differentiation block caused by
inhibiting mTOR was reversible. We transiently exposed cells to
rapamycin for 1–3 d, after which the culture medium was replen￾ished with rapamycin-free media for the remainder of the exper￾iment. On day 6 of differentiation, we quantified the number of
GalC  immature oligodendrocytes by immunocytochemistry.
Cultures transiently exposed to rapamycin for 1, 2, or 3 d showed
a significant increase in the numbers of GalC cells when compared
with cells treated with rapamycin for the duration of the experiment
(supplemental Fig. 3E, available at www.jneurosci.org as supple￾mental material) ( p  0.0001).
mTOR selectively regulates transcription factor activity
during oligodendrocyte differentiation
The observation that mTOR regulates the expression of several
myelin genes at the mRNA level suggests that mTOR regulates
the decision to commit to differentiation
rather than simply affecting myelin pro￾tein levels. One possible explanation is that
mTOR modulates the expression or activ￾ity of key transcription factors required for
differentiation.
Transcription factors involved in oligo￾dendrocyte specification and differentia￾tion include but are not limited to, the ba￾sic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family
members Olig1 and Olig2, SRY box con￾taining (Sox) family members Sox8, Sox9,
Sox10, and Sox17, the homeobox contain￾ing (Hox) transcription factor Nkx2.2, and
the zinc finger protein Yin Yang 1 (YY1).
The timing of OPC differentiation is also
regulated by several transcriptional inhib￾itors of myelin gene expression including
the inhibitor of DNA binding (Id) family
of proteins, Id2 and Id4, and transcription
factor 4 (Tcf4) (Kondo and Raff, 2000;
Wang et al., 2001; Marin-Husstege et al.,
2006; He et al., 2007). Therefore, we exam￾ined the effects of mTOR activation on the
expression of Olig2, Sox10, Nkx2.2, Id2,
Id4, and Tcf4 during oligodendrocyte differentiation in vitro. In￾terestingly, inhibiting mTOR did not significantly alter the
mRNA levels of Olig2, Sox10, or Nkx2.2 (Fig. 4A) and there
was no consistent trend suggesting an increase or decrease in
these mRNAs across multiple experiments. In contrast, inhib￾iting mTOR increased the mRNA levels of Id2, Id4, and Tcf4
by 2.7-fold, 3.8-fold, and 4.6-fold, respectively, relative to
control cultures (Fig. 4B: Id2, p  0.027;Id4, p  0.0259; Tcf4,
p  0.024).
Two distinct mTOR signaling complexes, mTORC1 and
mTORC2, are present in OPCs
mTOR interacts directly with the adaptor proteins raptor and
rictor to form two distinct signaling complexes, mTORC1 and
mTORC2 respectively, that control the activation of discrete
downstream signaling effectors (Kim et al., 2002; Sarbassov et al.,
2004). To define the repertoire of mTOR complexes present in
oligodendrocytes during differentiation, we performed coimmu￾noprecipitations with antibodies directed to mTOR after 1 and
2 d of differentiation in the presence or absence of 15 nM rapa￾mycin. Immune complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE fol￾lowed by Western blot analysis for mTOR, raptor and rictor.
Both mTORC1 and mTORC2 complexes formed during oligo￾dendrocyte differentiation (Fig. 5A). In addition, both mTORC1
and mTORC2 dissociated in response to rapamycin treatment
(Fig. 5A).
mTORC1 and mTORC2 complexes exert distinct effects on
OPC differentiation
To establish whether mTORC1 and mTORC2 complexes dis￾tinctly regulate oligodendrocyte differentiation, we performed
siRNA mediated knockdown of rictor and raptor. Specifically,
OPCs were transiently transfected with siRNA smart pools spe￾cific for mTOR, raptor, rictor, or with a control siRNA smart
pool. On day 5 of differentiation, MBP expression was quantified
by Western blot analysis. We observed a marked increase in MBP
expression in cells transfected with a control smart pool of siR￾NAs by 5 d of differentiation. In contrast, siRNA mediated

3.8-fold, and 4.6-fold increase inthemRNA levels of Id, Id4, and Tcf4,respectively(Id2, *p0.027; Id4, *p0.0259; Tcf4, *p

knockdown of rictor or raptor decreased
MBP expression by 44% and 31% respec￾tively. (Fig. 5B,C: rictor p  0.002, raptor
p  0.015).
To determine whether these complexes
were affecting mRNA expression or pro￾tein translation during OPC differentia￾tion, we measured the mRNA levels of
MBP and PLP on day 3 of differentiation
after transfection of siRNA smart pools
targeting raptor, rictor and mTOR. RNAi
mediated silencing of mTOR or rictor
caused a significant reduction in MBP and
PLP mRNA levels (Fig. 5D: mTOR siRNA
60%, p  0.006; rictor siRNA 37%, p 
0.45, PLP not shown). Interestingly, dis￾rupting mTORC1 by silencing raptor had
no effect on MBP or PLP mRNA levels.
mTORC1 and mTORC2 regulate
distinct downstream signaling targets
during OPC differentiation
To gain insight into the timing of their ac￾tivation during OPC differentiation, we
analyzed the phosphorylation of mTOR
and downstream targets. First, we evalu￾ated the phosphorylation of mTOR on Ser
2448 during OPC differentiation (Fig.
6A). We observed the sustained phos￾phorylation of mTOR during differentia￾tion, which was inhibited by rapamycin
(Fig. 6A).
Since Akt Ser 473 is a target of
mTORC2, we analyzed phosphorylation
at this site during OPC differentiation.
Phosphorylation of Akt Ser 473 was sustained during OPC dif￾ferentiation and was sensitive to rapamycin treatment (Fig. 6B).
Therefore, we quantified the levels of Akt Ser 473 phosphoryla￾tion in the presence or absence of rapamycin treatment on days 2
and 3 of differentiation (Fig. 6C). We focused on days 2 and 3 of
differentiation since: (1) Akt Ser 473 phosphorylation peaked
during these time points, and (2) progression to the immature
oligodendrocyte stage of differentiation coincides with 2 and 3 d
of differentiation in vitro. We observed a 58% and 61% reduction
in the level of Akt Ser 473 phosphorylation on days 2 and 3,
respectively, during rapamycin treatment (day 2, p  0.001; day
3, p  0.002) (Fig. 6C), consistent with a previous report showing
that the mTORC2 complex regulates phosphorylation of Akt
Ser473 (Sarbassov et al., 2005, 2006).
Next, we examined signaling targets regulated by the
mTORC1 complex. Specifically, we performed Western immu￾noblot analyses of the phosphorylation states of p70S6K1 and
4E-BPs. We observed an acute increase in the phosphorylation of
p70S6K1 Thr389 by 3 h of differentiation, which was maintained
through 24 h (Fig. 6D) but declined by 48 h (data not shown). We
then examined the phosphorylation states of 4E-BPs using an
antibody that recognizes both hypo- and hyper-phosphorylated
forms of 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2. Similar to the activation of
p70S6K1, hyperphosphorylation of 4E-BP peaked within the first
24 h of OPC differentiation and then declined through 48 and
72 h (Fig. 6E). Furthermore, rapamycin inhibited the phosphor￾ylation of p70S6K1 and 4E-BP at all time points (Fig. 6D,E).
mTOR activation is required during the transition to the
immature oligodendrocyte stage
Thus far we have shown that mTOR activity is required for OPC
differentiation past the late progenitor stage. Furthermore, we
showed that mTORC1 and mTORC2 complexes are formed and
activate downstream signaling targets during distinct phases of
oligodendrocyte differentiation. Specifically, the mTORC1 tar￾gets, p70S6K and 4E-BP, are activated early during oligodendro￾cyte differentiation and then decline by 48 h, while mTORC2
mediated phosphorylation of Akt is sustained through 96 h of
differentiation.
Because OPC differentiation in vitro takes place gradually over
the course of several days, we designed an experiment to deter￾mine whether the activation of mTOR is required acutely at the
onset of differentiation, or whether the activation of mTOR is
required specifically during the transition to the immature oligo￾dendrocyte stage. To define the time frame in which mTOR ac￾tivation promotes OPC differentiation, we delayed the addition
of rapamycin to cultures of differentiating OPCs. Specifically,
rapamycin was added to OPC cultures after 1, 2, 3, and 4 d of
differentiation. On day 5 of differentiation, the percentage of
GalC  immature oligodendrocytes was quantified by immuno￾cytochemistry and compared with untreated control cultures, or
cultures that were treated with rapamycin for the entire 5 d
period.
Consistent with previous experiments, we observed 55%
GalC  immature oligodendrocytes in control cultures, whereas
1% of cells treated with rapamycin for 5 d were GalC . The

addition of rapamycin to cultures after 1 and 2 d of differentia￾tion blocked GalC expression as efficiently as the addition of
rapamycin at the onset of differentiation (Fig. 6E). In contrast,
when rapamycin was added to cultures after 3 and 4 d in differ￾entiation media, we observed a 13-fold and 60-fold increase re￾spectively in the number of GalC  oligodendrocytes compared
with cells treated with rapamycin for5d( p  0.0001) (Fig. 6E).
Inhibiting mTOR prevents OPC differentiation in the
presence of DRG neurons
To determine whether OPC differentiation is dependent on the
activation of mTOR in the presence of signals derived from neu￾rons and to test whether inhibiting mTOR would reduce myeli￾nation, we performed a series of experiments using a coculture
system of OPCs seeded onto dorsal root ganglion neurons
(DRGs). Rapamycin was added to OPC-DRG cultures beginning
on day 2 after seeding to inhibit mTOR activation. After 7 or 18 d
of culture in the presence or absence of rapamycin, MBP staining
was performed and the number of MBP-positive oligodendro￾cytes as well as the number of myelin segments produced were
quantified.
Inhibiting mTOR significantly reduced the number of MBP 
oligodendrocytes generated in OPC-DRG cultures after 7 or 18 d
of differentiation for all doses of rapamycin tested (Fig.
7A,B,E,F). In addition, rapamycin decreased the extent of my￾elination in OPC-DRG cultures on day 7 as assessed by the ratio
of myelin segments to total cells (Fig. 7E). However, in longer
term OPC-DRG cocultures, a decrease in the extent of myelina￾tion was only observed in cultures treated with the higher doses of
rapamycin (Fig. 7F).
Discussion
The current studies demonstrate that the activation of mTOR
signaling is essential for differentiation of OPCs in vitro and cor￾relates with the development of myelinating oligodendrocytes in
vivo. Specifically, the activation of mTOR promotes the genera￾tion of GalC  immature oligodendrocytes in purified OPC cul￾tures and of MBP  oligodendrocytes in the presence of DRG
neurons. In contrast, the development of O4  late progenitors
from early OPCs is independent of mTOR signaling. Thus,
mTOR acts precisely during the transition to the immature oli￾godendrocyte stage, when OPCs commit to terminal differentia￾tion. Our data support the hypothesis that the expression of genes
required for OPC differentiation is regulated in distinct steps
during lineage progression that is dependent on a combination of
intrinsic and extrinsic cues. Whereas an intrinsic program may
drive progression to the later progenitor stage, our data suggest
that transition to the immature oligodendrocyte stage, and there￾fore the decision to commit to differentiation, is dependent on
extrinsic factors that activate mTOR signaling.
The extrinsic signals that activate mTOR during OPC differ￾entiation in vivo are currently unknown; however, factors that
potently stimulate the PI3K/Akt pathway are likely candidates.
For example, several studies have suggested that neuregulin,
IGF-I, and laminin-2 promote OPC differentiation and myelina￾tion through the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway. Of partic￾ular interest is IGF-I, which promotes OPC maturation. For ex￾ample, over-expressing IGF-I in transgenic mice results in a
hypermyelinated phenotype caused by increased myelin produc￾tion per oligodendrocyte (Carson et al., 1993). Conversely,
IGF-I/ mice exhibit hypomyelination characterized by a sig￾nificant decrease in myelin protein expression (Ye et al., 2002). In
vitro studies show that IGF-I has a profound effect on the gener￾Figure 6. Activation of mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling targets during OPC differentiation.

ation of GalC  oligodendrocytes by stim￾ulating the differentiation of O4/GalC
late progenitors (McMorris and Dubois￾Delcq, 1988). Furthermore, the media
used to initiate differentiation contain
micromolar levels of insulin, known to
stimulate the IGF-IR, and as such can be
considered IGF-I supplemented. In addi￾tion, a recent report by Swamydas et al.
(2008) showed that the neuroactive ste￾roids, progesterone and estrogen, potently
activate Akt/mTOR signaling in enriched
cultures of oligodendrocytes.
Our studies implicate Akt/mTOR sig￾naling as a critical pathway for the genera￾tion of mature oligodendrocytes. Interest￾ingly, recent studies demonstrated that
activation of the p38 MAPK pathway pro￾motes oligodendrocyte differentiation
(Bhat et al., 2007; Fragoso et al., 2007). Fu￾ture studies are required to determine
whether cross talk occurs between the p38
MAPK and Akt/mTOR pathways or
whether they act in a parallel manner to
promote OPC differentiation.
Our data demonstrate that mTOR reg￾ulates the expression of several key tran￾scriptional repressors during OPC differ￾entiation. Specifically, mTOR signaling
decreases the expression of Id2, Id4, and
Tcf4. Previous studies show that ectopic
expression of each of these transcriptional
repressors is sufficient to arrest OPC dif￾ferentiation at the late progenitor stage, ef￾fectively blocking the emergence of GalC 
immature oligodendrocytes (Kondo and
Raff, 2000; Wang et al., 2001; He et al.,
2007). These data suggest that a primary
function of mTOR activation during OPC
differentiation is to suppress the expres￾sion of transcriptional repressors, relieving their inhibition on
oligodendrocyte maturation. Because of the transcriptional con￾trol exerted by Id2, Id4, and Tcf4, we hypothesize that these fac￾tors are targets of the mTORC2 complex. Interestingly, a link
between mTOR and Id4 and Tcf4 may be explained by the ability
of mTOR to form a complex with and modulate the activity of the
transcription factor YY1, which has previously been shown to
regulate the expression of Id4 and Tcf4 during oligodendrocyte
differentiation (Cunningham et al., 2007; He et al., 2007).
Our data show that signaling through both mTORC1 and
mTORC2 is required during OPC differentiation, supporting the
conclusion that each complex contributes to the generation of
mature oligodendrocytes through distinct mechanisms. Disrupt￾ing mTORC1 or mTORC2 reduces the protein levels of MBP
during differentiation. However, only mTORC2 regulates the ex￾pression of the myelin genes MBP and PLP at the mRNA level.
These data suggest that mTORC2 transcriptionally controls key
genes required for OPC differentiation, whereas mTORC1 influ￾ences the generation of mature oligodendrocytes through an al￾ternate mechanism. Since mTORC1 targets, particularly 4E-BP,
mediate translation of specific mRNAs, it is likely that mTORC1
regulates the translation of myelin genes.
The observation that mTORC1 and mTORC2 phosphorylate
distinct downstream signaling effectors in a temporal manner
provides additional support for the hypothesis that each complex
exerts a unique role during OPC differentiation. Specifically, the
mTORC1 targets, p70S6K1 and 4E-BP, were phosphorylated
acutely during the onset of differentiation. However, the phos￾phorylation of these targets declined by 48 h. In contrast, the
phosphorylation of Akt Ser473, a substrate of the mTORC2 com￾plex, increased significantly by 24 h of differentiation and was
sustained through 96 h. Inhibiting mTOR completely abrogated
the phosphorylation of mTORC1 targets and partially, yet signif￾icantly, decreased the phosphorylation of Akt Ser473, represent￾ing an mTORC2-sensitive pool of Akt.
Our data suggest that the activation of mTORC1 targets,
while necessary, are not sufficient to promote OPC differenti￾ation. The delayed addition of rapamycin to cultures of differ￾entiating OPCs showed that the addition of rapamycin after
2 d of differentiation, subsequent to the peak activation of the
mTORC1 targets examined, was as effective at blocking the
generation of GalC  postmitotic oligodendrocytes as the ad￾dition of rapamycin at the onset of differentiation. Alterna￾tively, additional targets of the mTORC1 complex may exert
their effects during OPC differentiation. Furthermore, the
sustained activation of Akt, caused in part by signaling via

mTORC2, correlates directly with the transition to the imma￾ture oligodendrocyte stage.
Recent studies of transgenic mice that express a constitutively
active Akt (Akt-DD) in the oligodendrocyte lineage support a
role for mTOR signaling in OPC differentiation and myelination
(Flores et al., 2008). Specifically, PLP-Akt-DD mice exhibit an
increase in the generation of premyelinating oligodendrocytes by
postnatal day 14 and subsequent hypermyelination that persists
in adult mice. In addition, recent studies by the Macklin labora￾tory show a significant increase in the levels of phosphorylated
mTOR and p70S6K on postnatal day 21 and in actively myelinat￾ing adult oligodendrocytes in PLP-Akt-DD brains (Narayanan et
al., 2009). The administration of rapamycin to 6-week-old PLP￾Akt-DD mice inhibited the effect of active Akt on myelination.
Furthermore, postnatal day 21 old WT mice treated with rapa￾mycin exhibited a reduction in the PLP, MBP, CNP and MOG
protein and mRNA expression and decreased myelination. These
data are consistent with the hypothesis that the enhanced stimu￾lation of mTOR leads to the precocious development of myeli￾nating oligodendrocytes in vivo, and that mTOR signaling is es￾sential for normal myelination (Narayanan et al., 2009).
A central question in the development of myelinating oligo￾dendrocytes is whether the differentiation of OPCs and myelina￾tion are regulated by unique mechanisms (for review, see Rosen￾berg et al., 2007). Elegant studies of postnatal development in the
optic nerve demonstrate that the sequence of OPC differentiation
and myelination is temporally and spatially distinct, suggesting
that different signals are required to direct each process (Colello
et al., 1995). In addition, microarray studies suggest that the ter￾minal differentiation of oligodendrocytes occurs in a series of
sequential steps that includes at least two phases of myelin gene
induction regulated by independent sets of transcription factors
(Dugas et al., 2006). In OPC-DRG cocultures, inhibiting mTOR
blocked the appearance of MBP  oligodendrocytes, similar to
the effect seen in isolated OPC cultures. In contrast, the inhibi￾tion of mTOR at lower doses of rapamycin had a less pronounced
effect on myelination. These data support the idea that myelina￾tion is governed by a process distinct from that which regulates
differentiation. However, the possibility exists that low doses of
rapamycin were not sufficient to completely block activation of
mTOR, as a significant effect on myelination was observed for
cocultures treated with a high dose of rapamycin. In conclusion,
these data support a clear role for the activation of mTOR during
a critical stage of OPC differentiation, whereas a subsequent role
for mTOR in regulating the process of myelination during devel￾opment is less clear. On the other hand, the higher dose of rapa￾mycin did effect myelination in agreement with data showing
that overexpression of Akt/mTOR induces hypermyelination
(Narayanan et al., 2009).
The data presented here provide strong evidence to suggest
that mTOR signaling is a novel pathway required for OPC differ￾entiation. Most functional studies on the PI3K/Akt/mTOR path￾way have focused on its role in cell size and cell proliferation.
However, mTOR signaling has been implicated in the timing of
neuronal differentiation in the Drosophila eye and has been re￾ported to promote mammalian neurogenesis in response to
insulin/IGF-I mediated activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway
(Bateman and McNeill, 2004; Han et al., 2008). In our studies, the
mTOR pathway appears to selectively promote differentiation of
oligodendrocytes but not astrocytes or neurons. Accordingly, sig￾naling via mTOR represents an intriguing target for therapeutic
intervention to promote remyelination in disorders such as mul￾tiple sclerosis.
