Introduction The endothelial cell layer is 
the “guardian” of molecular traffic between 
the blood and surrounding tissue, and endothe‑
lial integrity plays a pivotal role in many aspects 
of vascular function, e.g., control of vasomotor 
tone and permeability. Cardiovascular risk fac‑
tors such as hypertension may cause endothe‑
lial dysfunction and even disintegration, finally 
resulting in small vessel disappearance (vascular 
rarefaction) and tissue hypoxia. In patients with 
chronic kidney diseases (CKD), ongoing endothe‑
lial damage in the capillary system of the renal 
medulla and accompanying vascular rarefaction 
are thought to be central processes toward pro‑
gressive kidney damage.1,2 Endothelial dysfunc‑
tion is highly prevalent in both cardiovascular 
disease and CKD.3‑5
Among various functions of the kidney, it is 
also an endocrine organ. In 2005, Xu et al.6 pre‑
sented in their landmark study the history of

Abstract
Introduction Renalase is an enzyme released by the kidneys, which breaks down catecholamines in 
the blood and thus may regulate blood pressure. In kidney transplant recipients, endothelial dysfunction 
is often present.
Objectives The aim of the study was to assess associations between renalase, blood pressure, and 
kidney function in kidney allograft recipients.
Patients and methods We studied 62 kidney allograft recipients. Complete blood count, urea and 
creatinine levels, serum lipids, and fasting glucose were measured by standard laboratory methods. We 
also assessed markers of coagulation: prothrombin fragments 1+2; fibrinolysis: tissue plasminogen ac￾tivator (tPA), plasminogen activator inhibitor, plasmin-antiplasmin complexes; endothelial function/injury: 
von Willebrand factor (vWF), thrombomodulin, intercellular adhesion molecule, vascular cell adhesion 
molecule (VCAM); and inflammation: high‑sensitivity C‑reactive protein and interleukin 6. Renalase levels 
were assessed using a commercially available kit.
Results Mean serum renalase levels in kidney allograft recipients correlated with age, time after 
transplantation, soluble CD44 (sCD44), VCAM, serum creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate 
(eGFR; measured by CKD‑EPI, MDRD, and Cockcroft‑Gault formulas), serum phosphate, urea, sCD146, 
vWF, and thrombomodulin and tended to correlate with tPA. In patients with eGFR above 60 ml/min, 
renalase was lower than in those with lower eGFR. In hypertensive allograft recipients, renalase was 
significantly higher than in normotensives. A multiple regression analysis showed that renalase was 
predicted in 58% by serum creatinine.
Conclusions Renalase, which is highly elevated in kidney transplant recipients, is dependent primarily 
on kidney function, which deteriorates with age and time after transplantation. Further studies are needed 
to establish the putative role of renalase in the pathogenesis of hypertension after transplantation and 
its possible use in novel targeted therapies.

systems, its dysfunction is not restricted ana‑
tomically to the heart, nor is it limited in disease 
scope to atherosclerosis. Considering the fact that 
endothelial dysfunction is present in kidney al‑
lograft recipients9 and renalase is expressed in 
the endothelium, the aim of the present study 
was to assess associations between renalase, and 
markers of endothelial dysfunction in kidney al‑
lograft recipients.
Patients and methods The study included 62 
kidney allograft recipients (47 men). Before trans‑
plantation, all kidney transplant recipients were 
on renal replacement therapy. The immunosup‑
pressive regimen of kidney transplant recipients 
consisted of calcineurin inhibitor, cyclosporine 
(mean levels, 162.60 ±52.71 ng/ml), in combina‑
tion with mycophenolate mofetil (2 g/d) and pred‑
nisone (median, 7.5 mg/d; ranges, 0–10 mg/d). 
They also received antihypertensive drugs, includ‑
ing calcium channel blockers (100%), β‑blockers 
(59%), angiotensin‑converting inhibitors (24%), 
diuretics (26%), together with statins (21%).
All patients maintained sufficient and stable 
graft function, showed no clinical signs of rejec‑
tion, or inflammation. All subjects gave written 
informed consent, and the protocol was approved 
by the Medical University Ethics Committee.
Blood was drawn in the morning when patients 
presented for routine control visits after an over‑
night fast. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was 
estimated using the simplified Modification of 
Diet in Renal Disease formula (MDRD; estimated 
GFR [eGFR] = 186.3 × serum creatinine [mg/dl]–1.14 
× age–0.203 × 0.742 if female × 1.21 if Afro‑Amer‑
ican)10 or the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemi‑
ology Collaboration (CKD‑EPI) equation.11 Crea‑
tinine clearance was estimated using the Cock‑
croft‑Gault formula.12 Complete blood count, urea, 
phosphate, and creatinine were measured by stan‑
dard laboratory methods in the central laborato‑
ry of the hospital. We evaluated thrombin activi‑
ty (prothrombin fragments 1+2, Enzygnost F1+2 
micro, Dade Behring, Marburg, Germany), and 
the degree of plasmin generation (plasmin‑an‑
tiplasmin complexes [PAP], Enzygnost PAP mi‑
cro, Dade Behring) by the use of commercially 
available kits. Markers of endothelial injury (von 
Willebrand factor [vWF], thrombomodulin) were 
measured using the commercially available kits 
from American Diagnostica, Greenwich, Con‑
necticut, United States, and adhesion molecules 
(inercellular adhesion molecule, vascular cell ad‑
hesion molecule [VCAM]) were measured using 
the kits from R&D Systems, Quantikine, Abing‑
don, United Kingdom. Tissue plasminogen acti‑
vator (tPA) and its inhibitor, plasminogen acti‑
vator inhibitor, were assayed using the kits from 
Bioopol, Umea, Sweden. High‑sensitivity C‑reac‑
tive protein (CRP) was measured using the com‑
mercially available assay from American Diagnos‑
tica and interleukin 6 (IL‑6) using the commer‑
cially available kit from R&D Systems. Renalase 
was assessed using the commercially available 
the discovery of renalase and its possible role in 
hypertension. Xu et al.6 reported that renalase 
had a flavin-adenine dinucleotide (FAD)‑binding 
domain, and that FAD was an essential cofactor 
for the stability and its monoamine oxidase activ‑
ity. Renalase is preferentially expressed in proxi‑
mal tubules, but also in the glomeruli and distant 
tubules, cardiomyocytes, liver, and skeletal mus‑
cles6 as well as in peripheral nerves, adrenals, en‑
dothelium, central nervous system, a 12.5‑day‑old 
rat embryo, and human adipose tissue.6,7 It de‑
grades catecholamines in vitro with a distinct sub‑
strate specificity and inhibitor profile, indicating 
that it represents a new class of flavin adenine 
dinucleotide-containing monoamine oxidases. It 
lowers blood pressure in vivo by decreasing car‑
diac contractility and heart rate and by prevent‑
ing the expected compensatory increase in pe‑
ripheral vascular tone.8

functional and highly distributed among all organ

kits from USCN Life Science Inc., Wuham, Chi‑
na. Healthy volunteers (n = 27) were included in 
the study to obtain normal ranges for renalase.
Statistical analysis Data were expressed as means 
± standard deviation (SD). The data given were 
analyzed using the Statistica 7.0. computer soft‑
ware. Normal distribution of variables was ana‑
lyzed using the Shapiro‑Wilk’s W test. The data 
were also logarithmically transformed to achieve 
normal distribution where possible. Normally dis‑
tributed data are reported as mean ± SD, nonnor‑
mally distributed data are expressed as a medi‑
an and minimal–maximal value. The Spearman or 
Pearson correlations were calculated as appropri‑
ate with P <0.05 considered statistically signifi‑
cant. The multiple regression analysis was used 
to determine independent factors affecting de‑
pendent variables. Factors showing a linear cor‑
relation with renalase (P <0.1) were included in 
the analysis.
Results Clinical and biochemical data of kid‑
ney allograft recipients are presented in TABLE 1. 
The mean serum renalase level in kidney al‑
lograft recipients was significantly higher com‑
pared with the control group (6.72 ±2.86 µg/ml 
vs. 3.86 ±0.73 µg/ml, P <0.001, respectively). In 
renal allograft recipients, renalase correlated with 
age (r = 0.29, P <0.05), time after transplantation 
(r = 0.34, P <0.01), CD44 (r = 0.49, P <0.0001), 
VCAM (r = 0.40, P <0.001) (FIGURE 1), serum crea‑
tinine (r = 0.49, P <0.001), eGFR (by CKD‑EPI for‑
mula, r = –0.44, P <0.0001; by MDRD, r = –0.43, 
P <0.001; by Cockcroft‑Gault, r = –0.39, P <0.01), 
serum phosphate (r = 0.33, P <0.05), urea (r = 0.41, 
P <0.01), CD146 (r=0.36, P <0.01), vWF (r = 0.26, 
P <0.06), thrombomodulin (r = 0.26, P <0.05) 
(FIGURE 2) and tended to correlate with tPA (r = 
0.24, P = 0.05). In a multiple regression analysis, 
renalase was predicted in 58% by serum creati‑
nine (β value, 0.33, P = 0.01), F = 4.49, SE = 2.12, 
and P <0.00029.
In patients with eGFR over 60 ml/min, renal‑
ase was significantly lower than in patients with 
eGFR below 60 ml/min (5.72 ±2.02 µg/ml vs. 7.63 
±3.22 µg/ml, P <0.001). In hypertensive kidney al‑
lograft recipients, renalase was significantly high‑
er than in normotensives (FIGURE 3).
Discussion Even a successful kidney transplan‑
tation did not restore normal kidney function and 
the majority of kidney allograft recipients had 
stage 2 or 3 CKD.13 It is known that CKD is relat‑
ed to increased cardiovascular mortality.14 Chron‑
ic renal failure has also been associated with im‑
paired immunity and subclinical inflammation in‑
volving cytokines derived from adipose tissue – ad‑
ipocytokines. Endothelial cell injury is a common 
finding in patients after kidney transplantation 
as shown previously.9 In humans, declining renal 
function may also affect the levels of inflammato‑
ry molecules, because serum CRP and IL‑6 levels 
are inversely correlated with creatinine clearance.15

dependent on kidney function. Due to wide tis‑
sue distribution of renalase, its function may be 
organ‑specific. Therefore, its synthesis and excre‑
tion might be related not only to kidney function. 
However, further studies are needed to prove 
a possible role of renalase in cardiovascular pa‑
thology, as well as in kidney allograft recipients 
and novel targeted therapies.

Worsening renal function may enhance overall in‑
flammatory responses because of the decreased 
renal clearance of factors that are directly or in‑
directly involved in inflammation and endotheli‑
al dysfunction.
We observed that renalase was significantly hi‑
gher in kidney transplant recipients than in heal‑
thy volunteers. In patients with eGFR over 60 ml/
min, renalase was significantly lower than in pa‑
tients with eGFR below 60 ml/min. In addition, 
renalase was related in the univariate analysis to 
kidney function, age, time after transplantation, 
and markers of endothelial dysfunction. Howe‑
ver, in the multiple regression analysis, renalase 
was predicted independently by kidney function. 
Only one clinical study, by Schlaich et al.,16 pre‑
sented also in the abstract form, showed that in 
patients with resistant hypertension (n = 22) ar‑
terial renalase was significantly higher in normo‑
tensive control subjects (n = 4, P <0.05). However, 
the whole body noradrenaline spillover tended to 
be higher in hypertensive patients, but without 
statistical significance (P = 0.12). Arterial rena‑
lase correlated negatively in univariate analysis 
with systolic blood pressure in the entire cohort 
(r = –0.52, P <0.05).
The association between renalase and hyper‑
tension was also observed by Zhao et al.,17 who 
were the first to show that in the Han Chinese 
population, the renalase encoding gene was a nov‑
el susceptibility gene for essential hypertension 
and its genetic variations might influence blood 
pressure. In Caucasian patients participating in 
the Heart and Soul Study, Farzaneh‑Far et al.18
reported that a functional missence polymor‑
phism (C allele) in renalase (Glu37Asp) was as‑
sociated with left ventricular hypertrophy, sys‑
tolic and diastolic dysfunction, poor exercise ca‑
pacity, and inducible ischemia; however, no as‑
sociation between this CC genotype and blood 
pressure in the population of stable coronary ar‑
tery disease was observed. In a recent paper, Stec 
et al.19 describes polymorphisms of renalase gene 
and their associations with hypertension in pa‑
tients on hemodialysis. We observed previously 
that diastolic blood pressure together with kid‑
ney function were predictors of renalase in kid‑
ney allograft recipients,20 but in the present study 
we could only notice that renalase was significant‑
ly higher in hypertensive kidney allograft recipi‑
ents than in normotensives.
This is the first report regarding the correla‑
tions between renalase and endothelium injury 
markers; however, renalase levels were predict‑
ed by kidney function. It results from the fact 
that as kidney function deteriorates, endothelial 
damage increases, which is reflected by the rise in 
vWF, thrombomodulin, and cytokines. It should 
be emphasized that renalase is secreted not only 
by the kidney, but also by cardiomyocytes, liver, 
adipose tissue, skeletal muscles, endothelium, 
and the central nervous system.
In conclusion, renalase, highly elevated in 
kidney transplant recipients, is predominantly

Streszczenie
Wprowadzenie Renalaza jest enzymem wydzielanym przez nerki, który powoduje degradację krążą￾cych we krwi katecholamin, przez co może mieć wpływ na regulację ciśnienia tętniczego. U chorych 
po przeszczepieniu nerki często występuje dysfunkcja śródbłonka.
Cele Celem pracy była ocena zależności pomiędzy stężeniem renalazy w surowicy, ciśnieniem tętniczym 
a czynnością nerek u chorych po przeszczepieniu nerki.
Pacjenci i metody Morfologia, stężenie mocznika i kreatyniny, lipidogram i glikemia na czczo zostały 
ocenione standardowymi metodami laboratoryjnymi. Oceniono również markery krzepnięcia: fragmenty 
protrombiny 1+2; markery fibrynolizy: tkankowy aktywator plazminogenu (tissue plasminogen activa￾tor – tPA), inhibitor aktywatora plazminogenu typu 1, kompleks plazmina–antyplazmina; markery funkcji/
uszkodzenia śródbłonka: czynnik von Willebranda (von Willebrand factor – vWF), trombomodulinę, czą￾steczki adhezyjne, cząsteczki adhezji komórkowej naczyń (vascular cell adhesion molecule – VCAM); 
markery stanu zapalnego: białko C‑reaktywne oznaczone metodą o dużej czułości i interleukina 6. Stężenie 
renalazy oceniono za pomocą powszechnie dostępnego zestawu.
Wyniki Średnie stężenie renalazy u chorych po przeszczepieniu korelowało z wiekiem, czasem po prze￾szczepieniu, sCD44, VCAM, stężeniem kreatyniny, oszacowanym przesączaniem kłębuszkowym (estimated 
glomerular filtration rate – eGFR; oszacowanym za pomocą wzorów: CKD‑EPI, MDRD, Cockcrofta i Gault), 
stężeniem fosforanów, mocznika, sCD146, vWF, trombomoduliny oraz wykazywało tendencję do kore￾lacji z tPA. U chorych z eGFR >60 ml/min stężenie renalazy było mniejsze niż u osób z niższym eGFR. 
U chorych po przeszczepieniu z nadciśnieniem tętniczym stężenie renalazy było większe niż u pacjentów 
bez nadciśnienia tętniczego. Analiza wieloczynnikowej regresji wykazała, że czynnikiem predykcyjnym 
poziomu renalazy było w 58% przypadków stężenie kreatyniny.
Wnioski Stężenie renalazy, znacznie zwiększone u chorych po przeszczepieniu nerki, w głównym stopniu 
zależy od czynności nerek, która pogarsza się z wiekiem i w miarę upływu czasu po przeszczepieniu. Istnieje 
potrzeba przeprowadzenia dalszych badań potwierdzających przypuszczalną rolę renalazy w patogenezie 
nadciśnienia tętniczego u chorych po przeszczepieniu nerki oraz jej ewentualnego wykorzystania jako 
celu terapeutycznego.
