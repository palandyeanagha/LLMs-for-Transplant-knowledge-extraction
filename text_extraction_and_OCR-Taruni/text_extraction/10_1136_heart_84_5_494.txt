Abstract
OBJECTIVE To characterise the severity and progression of cardiac
allograft vascular disease (CAVD) in a large patient cohort, and to
evaluate possible immunological and non-immunological risk
factors for progression.
DESIGN A prospective observational study using intravascular
ultrasound.
SETTING Two university hospitals.
PATIENTS AND MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Changes in focal
plaque, lumen, and total vessel area (worst site method) were
assessed at baseline and after 12.1 (2.8) months (mean (SD)) of
follow up in a cohort of 96 patients (79 male, 17 female; mean age
48.7 (9.6) years; time post-transplant 26.0 (32.4) months).
RESULTS Overall, the mean (SD) intimal index of worst sites
increased by 6.7 (8.8)%. The increase in the first 12 months was 7.5
(9.4)%, v 5.9 (8.0)% after the first year (NS). Analysing
immunological and non-immunological risk factors (age, underlying
disease, sex, donor age, immunosuppression, cytomegalovirus,
rejection episodes, cholesterol), low density lipoprotein (LDL)
cholesterol was found to be the most important predictor of severe
progression (as defined by an increase in intimal index of ⩾ 15% (p 
= 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS Progression of CAVD is characterised by a
continuing increase in intimal hyperplasia, especially within the
first year after heart transplantation. LDL cholesterol is an
important predictor of major progression.
