Despite a long-suspected role in the development of human colorectal cancer (CRC), the
composition of gut microbiota in CRC patients has not been adequately described. In this study,
fecal bacterial diversity in CRC patients (n ¼ 46) and healthy volunteers (n ¼ 56) were profiled by 454
pyrosequencing of the V3 region of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene. Both principal component analysis
and UniFrac analysis showed structural segregation between the two populations. Forty-eight
operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified by redundancy analysis as key variables
significantly associated with the structural difference. One OTU closely related to Bacteroides
fragilis was enriched in the gut microbiota of CRC patients, whereas three OTUs related to
Bacteroides vulgatus and Bacteroides uniformis were enriched in that of healthy volunteers. A total
of 11 OTUs belonging to the genera Enterococcus, Escherichia/Shigella, Klebsiella, Streptococcus
and Peptostreptococcus were significantly more abundant in the gut microbiota of CRC patients,
and 5 OTUs belonging to the genus Roseburia and other butyrate-producing bacteria of the family
Lachnospiraceae were less abundant. Real-time quantitative PCR further validated the significant
reduction of butyrate-producing bacteria in the gut microbiota of CRC patients by measuring the
copy numbers of butyryl-coenzyme A CoA transferase genes (Mann–Whitney test, Po0.01).
Reduction of butyrate producers and increase of opportunistic pathogens may constitute a major
structural imbalance of gut microbiota in CRC patients.

Introduction
Colorectal cancer (CRC), also known as large bowel
cancer, is one of the most common forms of cancer
and the third most common cause of cancer
mortality in the world (Jemal et al., 2011). Although
heredity is tightly associated with some forms of
CRC (Lynch and de la Chapelle, 2003), diet is
considered to be the most significant risk factor of
this disease by many researchers. Incidence of up to
80% of CRC has been attributed to dietary factors in
western populations by epidemiological surveys
(Bingham, 2000). High rates of CRC are found in
populations consuming diets high in animal fat, red
meat and processed meat, and low in unrefined
grains, dietary fiber and vegetables (Chan and
Giovannucci, 2010; Dahm et al., 2010).
A highly diverse and dense microbiota exists in
the lower part of the human gastrointestinal tract.
Recent studies have shown that diet has a dominat￾ing role in shaping the structure of gut microbiota
(De Filippo et al., 2010; Walker et al., 2010;
Zhang et al., 2010), which anaerobically ferments
dietary components that are not completely digested
and absorbed in the upper gastrointestinal tract (van
Hylckama Vlieg et al., 2011). Metabolites and
antigens produced by gut microbiota may have
significant roles in influencing CRC risk through
their interactions with host metabolism and immu￾nity (Davis and Milner, 2009; Saleh and Trinchieri,
2011).
The types of bacteria and their metabolites that
may affect the progression of CRC have long been of Received 26 April 2011; revised 5 July 2011; accepted 6 July 2011;

interest. For example, acetaldehyde-producing bac￾teria, sulphate-reducing bacteria and 7a-dehydrox￾ylating bacteria have been implicated as possible
contributing factors to the risk of CRC, due to their
metabolites possessing colonic inflammatory and
tumor-inducing toxicities, including acetaldehyde
(Homann et al., 2000), hydrogen sulfide (Huycke
and Gaskins, 2004) and secondary bile acids (Tong
et al., 2008; Bernstein et al., 2009), so on. On the
other hand, bacterial metabolites that may reduce
CRC risk include butyrate and other short-chain
fatty acids (Scharlau et al., 2009), and conjugated
linoleic acids (Palombo et al., 2002), so on. Produ￾cers of these compounds, identified by isolation and
in vitro characterization, have thus been regarded as
beneficial bacteria for human colon health. These
bacteria are widely distributed in different phyloge￾netic groups, including the butyrate producers in
the order Clostridiales (Louis and Flint, 2009) and
conjugated linoleic acids producers in the orders
Clostridiales, Lactobacillales, Bifidobacteriales, and
Actinomycetales, so on (Devillard et al., 2007).
Researchers have also made efforts to search for
gut bacterial types possibly related with CRC by
comparing their abundance between CRC patients/
high-risk populations and healthy populations.
Moore and Moore (1995) found through cultivation
of human fecal microbiota that Bacteroides vulgatus,
Eubacterium spp., Ruminococcus spp., Streptococ￾cus hansenii, Bifidobacterium spp. and Faecalibac￾terium prausnitzii were significantly higher in
people with high CRC risk, while species Lactoba￾cillus S06 and Eubacterium aerofaciens were sig￾nificantly higher in people with low CRC risk. Using
the same method, O’Keefe et al. (O’Keefe et al.,
2007) associated 7-a dehydroxylating bacteria to
high CRC risk populations and Lactobacillus plan￾tarum to low CRC risk populations. Using group￾specific quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays, fecal
amounts of Desulfovibrio sp. (Scanlan et al., 2009)
and Enterococcus faecalis (Balamurugan et al.,
2008) were found to be significantly higher in CRC
patients than in healthy controls, while Bacteroides/
Prevotella levels were significantly lower (Sobhani
et al., 2011). Differences were also observed in the
overall structure of the gut microbiota between
four healthy persons and four persons with colonic
adenoma (Shen et al., 2010), as well as between
six healthy persons and six CRC patients (Sobhani
et al., 2011).
However, adequate knowledge has not yet been
provided by previous studies due to the well-known
limitations of culture-based methods and DNA
fingerprinting techniques, or the small sample size.
With the development of high-throughput DNA￾sequencing technology and application of multi￾variate statistical tools, researchers are now able to
do a ‘microbiome-wide association study’ to reveal
microbial variations that are possibly linked to
environmental changes such as the host health
status, with higher resolution and fewer biases
(Andersson et al., 2008; Dethlefsen et al., 2008). In
this study, we employed this type of strategy to
reveal a significant segregation of the gut microbiota
of CRC patients from healthy volunteers, and
identified the bacterial phylotypes important for
this segregation.
Materials and methods
Sampling
All the 46 CRC patients, aged 42–77 years, were
from Shanghai Cancer Hospital, Shanghai Medical
College, Fudan University (Shanghai, China). All
patients were categorized according to histopatho￾logical features by TNM classification of malignant
tumors after surgery. None of the patients were on
any medication before sample collection. The 56
healthy volunteers, aged 40–54 years, were selected
as controls during a routine physical examination
and none of them had had gastrointestinal tract
disorders or any antibiotics in the past 3 months
before sample collection (Table 1). All participants
were local residents of Shanghai city for more than
10 years. Informed consent was given by all
individuals before participation. One fecal sample
was collected from each control, and from each
patient before surgery. Fecal samples were frozen
immediately after sampling and stored at 80 1C.
DNA extraction
Genomic DNA was extracted from each fecal sample
by bead-beating extraction and phenol–chloroform
purification, as described previously (Li et al.,
2008). The amount of DNA was determined by
Fluorescent and Radioisotope Science Imaging
Systems FLA-5100 (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan).
Integrity and size of DNA were checked by 0.8%
(w/v) agarose gel electrophoresis in 0.5 mg ml1
ethidium bromide. All DNA samples were stored
at 20 1C until further processing.
Pyrosequencing
The V3 region of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA)
gene from each DNA sample was amplified using

. The
NNNNNNNN was the sample-unique 8-base bar￾code for sorting of PCR amplicons into different
samples, and the underlined text indicates universal
bacterial primers for the V3 region of the 16S rRNA
gene (Muyzer et al., 1993). PCR amplification,
pyrosequencing of the PCR amplicons, and quality
control of raw data were performed, as described
previously (Zhang et al., 2010).
Bioinformatics and multivariate statistics
All reads were sorted into different samples according
to barcodes. After removal of barcodes, the sequences
were clustered using the program CD-HIT with 99.8%
similarity (Li and Godzik, 2006). The most abundant
sequence of each cluster was selected as a representa￾tive and aligned by NAST multi-aligner with template
length X100 bases and percent identity X75%
(DeSantis et al., 2006). RDP Classifier was used for
taxonomical assignments of all sequences at 80%
confidence level (Cole et al., 2009). Relative abun￾dances of different phyla and genera in each sample
were calculated and compared between healthy
volunteers and CRC patients using the Student’s t-test
(data of normalized distribution) or Mann–Whitney
test (data of non-normalized distribution) via software
SPSS 17.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA). All aligned
sequences were imported into ARB (Ludwig et al.,
2004) to construct a neighbor-joining tree. The tree,
together with sequence abundance data, was then
used for online Fast UniFrac analysis based on
weighted metric (Hamady et al., 2010). Operational
taxonomic unit (OTU) was classified with DOTUR
(Schloss and Handelsman, 2005). For each library,
OTUs defined at 98% similarity level were
used for coverage analysis using Good’s coverage by
[1 (n/N)] 100 (Good, 1953), and richness and diver￾sity estimations using Rarefaction analysis (aRarefact￾Win software, S Holland, Stratigraphy Laboratory,
University of Georgia, Athens, GA, USA, http://
www.uga.edu/strata/software), Shannon diversity
index (H’) (R package 2.7.1), as well as Simpson’s
diversity index (1-D), and Buzas and Gibson’s
evenness index (exp(H’)/S) (PAST software,
Ø Hammer, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway,
http://www.nhm.uio.no/norlex/past/download.html).
The most abundant sequence of each OTU (98%
similarity) was BLAST searched against the RDP
database (Release 10) to determine the phylogeny of
the OTU. Relative abundances of OTUs were used for
principal component analysis, multivariate analysis of
variance, and redundancy analysis via Matlab R2010a
(The MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA) and Canoco for
Windows 4.5 (Microcomputer Power, NY, USA).
Real-time qPCR
Fecal DNA from each sample was subjected to real￾time qPCR assays to determine the amounts of total
bacteria and Bacteroides spp. through detection of
16S rRNA genes, and the amount of butyrate-produ￾cing bacteria through detection of butyryl-coenzyme
A (CoA) CoA transferase genes. PCR reactions were
performed using iQ SYBR Green SuperMix (Bio-Rad,
Richmond, CA, USA) on a DNA Engine Opticon 3
system (MJ Research, Waltham, MA, USA). Each
25-ml reaction system contained 12.5 pmol of each
primer for amplification of 16S rRNA genes of total
bacteria, or 7 pmol of each primer for amplification of
Bacteroides spp. 16S rRNA genes, or 25 pmol of each
primer for amplification of butyryl-CoA CoA transfer￾ase genes. Primers and amplification conditions are
listed in Supplementary Table S1. For each reaction,
fluorescence detection was performed at the end of
each cycle at 80 1C for 5 s. After all cycles, amplifica￾tion specificity was monitored via dissociation curve
analysis of PCR end products by increasing the
temperature at a rate of 0.5 1C per 10 s from 60 to
95 1C with continuous fluorescence collection. Am￾plification efficiency was determined using Opticon
Monitor Software (Version 3.1, MJ Research) from the
slope of the line during the linear phase of the PCR
reaction. Reactions with efficiency of 1.8–2.2 were
selected for further analysis. A plasmid containing a
Bacteroides spp. full-length 16S rRNA gene from a
previous study (Li et al., 2008) was prepared using
the QIAGEN Plasmid Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden,
Germany) and diluted from 1 103 to 1 109
(copies ml
1
) to construct standard curves for the
detection of total bacteria and Bacteroides spp. A
plasmid containing a single butyryl-CoA CoA trans￾ferase gene amplicon was prepared and diluted from
1 103 to 1 109 (copies ml
1
) to construct standard
curves for the detection of butyrate-producing bacter￾ia. Reactions for standard samples were performed in
triplicate and others in duplicate. Copy number of the
targeting gene in each reaction was determined by
comparison to the standard curve via Opticon
Monitor Software. The Bacteroides spp. specific 16S
rRNA gene copy number or butyryl-CoA CoA trans￾ferase gene copy number in relation to total 16S rRNA
gene copy number was calculated for each sample,
and compared between healthy volunteers and CRC
patients by Mann–Whitney test as above. The
amounts of Bacteroides spp. measured by qPCR and
pyrosequencing were compared using Spearman’s
rank correlation coefficient via SPSS 17.0 (SPSS Inc).

reads per sample. After CD-HIT clustering and
NAST alignment, 21 043 unique representative
sequences were generated. OTUs were delineated
at 98% similarity level because higher thresholds
generated a dramatic increase of OTU numbers,
which might represent the microdiversity at sub￾species level (Supplementary Figure S3) (Zhang
et al., 2009). The total number of OTUs at 98%
similarity level was 4249 (Supplementary Table S2).
The values of Good’s coverage of all libraries were
above 94%. While no rarefaction curve plateaued
with the current sequencing, the Shannon diversity
estimates of all samples already reached stable
values at this sequencing depth, suggesting that
although new phylotypes would be expected with
additional sequencing, most diversity had already
been captured (Supplementary Figure S1). There
were no statistically significant differences with
Shannon diversity index, Simpson’s diversity index
or Buzas or Gibson’s evenness index between the gut
microbiota of healthy volunteers and CRC patients
(Student’s t-test, P40.05; Supplementary Table S3).
Taxonomy-based comparisons of gut microbiota at the
phylum and genus levels between healthy volunteers
and CRC patients
The amounts of different phyla and genera were
assessed by taxonomic assignment of all sequences
using RDP Classifier. Among all bacterial groups
revealed by the interpretable sequences, Firmicutes
was the most predominant phylum, contributing
57.2% and 63.1% of the gut microbiota in healthy
volunteers and CRC patients, respectively, followed
by Bacteroidetes, which contributed 32.0% and
22.7%, respectively. Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria
and Fusobacteria constituted the next most domi￾nant phyla, contributing 2.81%, 2.22% and 2.20%
of healthy volunteers, and 4.68%, 4.55% and 1.59%
of CRC patients, respectively (Supplementary Figure
S2). Microbial compositions showed high inter￾individual variability. For example, Firmicutes
accounted for 16.6–94.5%, and Bacteroidetes
0.13–75.0% among all individuals (Supplementary
Table S4). Bacteroidetes was statistically signi￾ficantly more abundant in the gut microbiota of
healthy volunteers than that of CRC patients, and
Proteobacteria significantly less abundant in the gut
microbiota of healthy volunteers (P ¼ 0.002 and
0.045, respectively).
At the genus level, Firmicutes in the gut micro￾biota of CRC patients mainly consisted of Faecali￾bacterium, Blautia, Enterococcus, Subdoligranulum,
Dorea, Roseburia, Megamonas, and Streptococcus,
each constituting more than 1% of total bacteria in
this population. Relatively abundant genera (41%)
in other phyla included Bacteroides, Prevotella,
Parabacteroides and Porphyromonas of Bacteroi￾detes; Bifidobacterium and Collinsella of Actinobac￾teria; and Escherichia/Shigella of Proteobacteria.
Statistically, the relative abundance of five genera:
Bacteroides, Roseburia, Alistipes, Eubacterium and
Parasutterella were found to be significantly higher
in healthy volunteers than CRC patients, whereas
another five genera: Porphyromonas, Escherichia/
Shigella, Enterococcus, Streptococcus and Peptos￾treptococcus were significantly lower in healthy
volunteers than CRC patients (Po0.05; Table 2).
Structural comparison of gut microbiota between
healthy volunteers and CRC patients with
multivariate statistics
Multivariate statistical analyses were performed to
compare the overall structure of gut microbiota of all
samples. Principal component analysis based on the
relative abundance of OTUs revealed a separation of
the healthy and CRC individuals on the basis of the

first two principal component (PC) scores, which
accounted for 15.31% and 12.37% of the total
variations (Figure 1a). A multivariate analysis of
variance test further indicated that the variation of
all individuals exhibited by the first two PC axes
was probably explained by disease status (P ¼ 0.002)
rather than gender (P ¼ 0.653) or age (age groups
of 40–49, 50–59, 60–69, 70–79 years, P ¼ 0.165).
Principal coordinate analysis based on weighted
UniFrac metric confirmed the above findings,
showing a significant separation of healthy volun￾teers and CRC patients (Figure 1b). At other
similarity level of OTUs (95%, 97%, 99% and
100%), consistent results of principal component
analysis and multivariate analysis of variance were
obtained (Supplementary Figure S4).
Redundancy analysis was performed using
healthy or diseased as constrained explanatory
variables and relative abundances of all OTUs as
response variables. Monte Carlo Permutation Test
showed that the constrained ordination model by
healthy or diseased was significant (P ¼ 0.002) and
5.3% of the variance in OTU abundance data can be
explained by the canonical axis. We identified 48
OTUs as key variables, which were well fitted by the
sample scores on the canonical axis; each had at
least 5% of the variability in its values explained by
this axis (Figure 2). On the redundancy analysis
ordination plot, 19 OTUs were enriched in the gut
microbiota of healthy volunteers, among which 10
OTUs belonged to the genera Alistipes, Phascolarcto￾bacterium, Oscillibacter, or unclassified genera of the
order Clostridiales; 4 OTUs belonged to the butyrate￾producing genus Roseburia, and 1 OTU was closely
related to the butyrate-producing bacterium A2-166
(100% similarity) of the family Lachnospiraceae. On
the contrary, 29 OTUs were enriched in the gut
microbiota of CRC patients, which mainly belonged
to genera Escherichia/Shigella, Klebsiella, or Citro￾bacter of the family Enterobacteriaceae, and genera
Streptococcus, Enterococcus, Peptostreptococcus,
Eggerthella, Fusobacterium, Gemella, or some other
bacteria of the order Clostridiales. Interestingly, two
OTUs closely related to B. vulgatus (100% and 98.7%
similarity, respectively) and one OTU related to
Bacteroides uniformis (97.5% similarity) were en￾riched in the gut microbiota of healthy volunteers,
while one OTU closely related to Bacteroides fragilis
(98.1% similarity) was enriched in that of CRC
patients. Two OTUs of the order Bifidobacteriales
were also enriched in the gut microbiota of CRC
patients (Figure 3). Mann–Whitney tests showed that
the relative abundances of 46 OTUs out of the 48 were
significantly different between healthy and CRC
individuals (Po0.05, Supplementary Table S5).
Real-time qPCR
Group-specific qPCR was used to determine the
relative amounts of Bacteroides spp. and butyrate￾producing bacteria in all samples (Supplementary
Table S6). Bacteroides spp. was found to be
significantly more abundant in healthy volunteers
than CRC patients (P ¼ 0.005). Quantification of
Bacteroides spp. by qPCR and pyrosequencing
showed a significantly high degree of consistency
(Spearman correlation, r ¼ 0.932, Po0.001), indicat￾ing that differences at genus level between healthy
volunteers and CRC patients found by pyrosequen￾cing are reliable. The abundances of butyrate￾producing bacteria, as represented by butyryl-CoA
CoA transferase genes, were significantly higher in
the gut microbiota of healthy volunteers than CRC
patients (P ¼ 1.5e–4).
Discussion
Gut microbiota interact extensively with the host
through metabolic exchange and co-metabolism of
substrates to maintain the normal functions and

health status of the intestinal tract and the whole
body (Nicholson et al., 2005). In this study, we
revealed differing gut microbiota structure patterns
in CRC patients compared with healthy persons.
Significance of the associated structural shift of gut
microbiota in the progression of human diseases has
been highlighted by several recent publications.
In our earlier study, we observed significant differ￾entiation of gut microbiota between healthy rats and
carcinogen-treated rats that developed colonic pre￾cancerous lesions, but were still apparently healthy
(Wei et al., 2010). Alterations of gut microbiota have
also been suggested to occur in Crohn’s disease
patients, ulcerative colitis patients (Frank et al.,
2007; Willing et al., 2009, 2010), children with
celiac disease (Nadal et al., 2007), and infants
suffering from allergic inflammation (Kalliomaki
and Isolauri, 2003).
An important part of the structural imbalance is a
significant depletion of butyrate-producing bacteria
in the gut microbiota of CRC patients. Adequate
amounts of butyrate has been implicated in the
protection against colitis and CRC by reducing
oxidative damage to DNA, inducing apoptosis in
DNA-damaged cells, inhibiting tumor cell growth,
and decreasing the activity of co-carcinogenic
enzymes (Pryde et al., 2002; Rose et al., 2007). The
in vivo supply of butyrate largely depends on the
butyrate-producing bacteria, which are mainly
classified into two groups: the Clostridium leptum
cluster (or clostridial cluster IV, represented by
F. prausnitzii) and the Clostridium coccoides cluster
(or clostridial cluster XIVa, represented by Eubac￾terium rectale/Roseburia spp.) of the phylum
Firmicutes (Louis and Flint, 2009). Here we showed
reduced amounts of C. coccoides (Roseburia spp.
and Eubacterium spp.) in the gut microbiota of CRC
patients by pyrosequencing analysis. We further
confirmed the depletion of butyrate producers in
CRC patients by measuring the levels of partial
butyryl-CoA CoA transferase gene, which is
involved in the butyrate formation pathway in the
majority of human colonic butyrate producers
(Louis and Flint, 2007).
Balamurugan et al.(Balamurugan et al., 2008)
found by qPCR assays that F. prausnitzii decreased
approximately fourfold in 20 CRC patients com￾pared with 17 healthy volunteers. In our study,
Faecalibacterium constituted more than 11% of
microbiota of either healthy volunteers or CRC
patients, with no difference in between. No OTU
related to F. prausnitzii was found to contribute to
the structural differentiation between CRC patients
and healthy controls. Instead, our results show that
a decrease in Roseburia spp. is more closely
associated with the occurrence of CRC. It has been
suggested by two dietary intervention studies that,
population densities of Roseburia/E. rectale spp.
have a strong correlation with fecal butyrate con￾centrations in response to altered carbohydrate
supply while F. prausnitzii does not (Duncan
et al., 2007; Ramirez-Farias et al., 2009). This
indicates the importance of Roseburia spp. and
E. rectale in the production of butyrate in vivo. A
culture-based study has also suggested that Rose￾buria spp. are the most important active conjugated
linoleic acids producers in the human gut (Devillard
et al., 2007). Our findings here have suggested
that Roseburia spp. may have important roles in
protecting hosts from CRC.
Another feature of the structural imbalance of gut
microbiota in CRC patients is the significant in￾crease in a variety of opportunistic pathogens. Some
researchers have proposed hypotheses for the
oncogenic potential of bacteria during the progres￾sion to CRC, while the mechanisms were suggested
to include induction of inflammation or production
of mutagenic toxins (Collins et al., 2010). Inflamma￾tion is commonly associated with CRC. Colitis￾associated cancer, a subtype of CRC, develops
directly from inflammatory bowel disease. Other
sporadic CRCs, which are not associated with
clinically detectable inflammatory bowel disease,
also display robust inflammatory infiltration and
increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines
(Terzic et al., 2010). Inflammation associated with
CRC has been suggested to be related to bacterial
infection. Through isolation and cultivation from
biopsy samples, Martin et al. (Martin et al., 2004)
have found increased proportion of hemagglutinin
expressing Escherichia coli in Crohn’s disease and
colon cancer patients compared with healthy con￾trols. It has also been suggested that enteropatho￾genic E. coli possesses the ability to downregulate
DNA mismatch repair proteins and, therefore,
promotes colonic tumorigenesis (Maddocks et al.,
2009). Streptococcus bovis promotes the progression
of preneoplastic lesions by increasing cell prolifera￾tion and interleukin-8 production in a rat model
(Ellmerich et al., 2000), and its wall-extracted anti￾gens promote carcinogenesis in Caco-2 (human
colorectal adenocarinoma epithelium) cells by over￾expression of cyclo-oxygenase-2 (Biarc et al., 2004).
E. faecalis produces extracellular superoxide that
damages colonic epithelial cell DNA both in vitro
and in vivo (Huycke and Moore, 2002; Huycke et al.,
2002), and its population was found to be signifi￾cantly higher in CRC patients compared with healthy
volunteers by qPCR assays (Balamurugan et al., 2008).
Both these studies and our results suggest that
Enterococcus, Streptococcus, and Escherichia/Shigella
may contribute to the differentiation of the gut
microbiota of CRC patients from healthy controls.
Previous studies have suggested that a significant
reduction of the phylum Bacteroidetes occurs in
Crohn’s disease/ulcerative colitis patients compared
with controls (Ott et al., 2004; Frank et al., 2007).
However, in our study, we have found different
changes among genera of this phylum that, Bacter￾oides decreased while Porphyromonas increased
significantly in the gut microbiota of CRC patients
compared with controls. Furthermore, key OTUs

in the genus Bacteroides also showed different
enrichments between healthy volunteers and CRC
patients. Previous studies have suggested that
different Bacteroides strains may influence the host
health in different ways. A B. vulgatus strain was
shown to protect against E. coli-induced colitis in
interleukin-2-deficient mice (Waidmann et al.,
2003), while interleukin-10 knockout (Il10/)
mice monoassociated with pig isolates of B. vulgatus
have significantly reduced colitis-associated color￾ectal tumor multiplicity compared with common
Il10/ mice (Uronis et al., 2009). In contrast, the
common colonic commensal, enterotoxigenic
B. fragilis was reported to trigger cellular prolifera￾tion, colonic colitis and strongly induce colonic
tumors in multiple intestinal neoplasia (Min) mice
(Wu et al., 2009). These studies are in agreement with
our finding that the OTU related to B. fragilis was
more abundant in CRC patients and the two related to
B. vulgatus were more abundant in healthy persons. It
is also reported that non-toxigenic human commensal
bacterium B. fragilis, which expresses a single
microbial molecule polysaccharide A, has the
potential to protect animals from experimental
colitis induced by Helicobacter hepaticus infection
(Mazmanian et al., 2008). The possible strain-specific
bioactivities of Bacteroides group members in human
gut suggest that more work at the gene or strain level
is still needed to identify the effects of gut microbes
relevant to the pathogenesis of CRC.
With this design of cross-sectional cohort study, it
is not possible to untangle the causal relationship
between gut microbiota and CRC. As samples were
collected from patients already diagnosed with CRC,
the changes of gut microbiota identified in this work
might be just a consequence of CRC. However, these
imbalanced changes might contribute to the further
progression of CRC through the possible mechanisms
discussed above. One way to help clarify the possible
roles of gut microbiota in CRC could be correcting this
structural imbalance by using designed nutritional
interventions or gut microbiota transplantation from
healthy donors (Borody et al., 2003).
In summary, by comparing the gut microbial
composition of CRC patients and healthy volun￾teers, we have identified a structural imbalance of
the gut microbiota, represented by the reduction of
butyrate producers and the increase of opportunistic
pathogens, which may be a significant feature of
human CRC. The structural imbalance of gut micro￾biota revealed in this work may provide insights for
in-depth analysis of host–microbe interactions and
determination of their roles in cancer development.
