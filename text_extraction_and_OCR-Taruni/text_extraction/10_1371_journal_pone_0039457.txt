Abstract
Background: Hyperuricemia is an independent risk factor of nephropathy, but its role in renal transplant recipients (RTRs) is
controversial.
Methods: Based on the methods of Cochrane systematic reviews, we searched MEDLINE (1948–2011.6), EMBASE (1956–
2011.6), CBM (Chinese Biomedicine Database) (1978–2011.6) to identify cohort studies assessing the association between
uric acid level and kidney allograft. Two authors independently screened the studies, assessed the risk of bias of included
studies and extracted data. Unadjusted odds ratio(OR), mean difference (MD), adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) and their
corresponding 95%CI were pooled to assess the effects of hyperuricemia on kidney allograft.
Results: Twelve cohort studies were included and the quality was moderate to high based on the NEWCASTLE-OTTAWA
quality assessment scale. RTRs with hyperuricemia had lower eGFR (P,0.0001, 95%CI216.34,6.14) and higher SCr
(P,0.00001, 95%CI 0.17,0.31) than those with normal uric acid level. Meta-analysis showed that hyperuricemia was a risk
factor of chronic allograft nephropathy (Unadjusted OR = 2.85, 95%CI 1.84,4.38, adjusted HR = 1.65, 95%CI 1.02,2.65) and
graft loss (Unadjusted OR = 2.29, 95%CI 1.55,3.39; adjusted HR = 2.01, 95%CI 1.39,2.94).
Conclusions: Current evidence suggests that hyperuricemia may be an independent risk factor of allograft dysfunction.
Hyperuricemia may modestly increase the risk of poor outcomes of RTRs. Future research is needed to verify whether
lowering uric acid level could improve the kidney function and prognosis of RTRs with hyperuricemia.

Introduction
Kidney transplantation has become a routine procedure in
patients with end-stage renal failure as the development of kidney
transplant technique and medicine. However, shortage of donors,
the long-term outcomes and morbidity of kidney transplant
patients are still remained problems [1]. Multiple factors
contribute to long-term function and survival of the allograft.
One study has shown that all kidney transplant recipients (RTRs)
inevitably have or will have chronic kidney disease (CKD) as a
result of the development of chronic allograft nephropathy(CAN)
[2].
Increasing experimental and epidemiological studies suggest
that hyperuricemia may play a role in the progression of
cardiovascular and renal diseases. UA induces endothelial cell
dysfunction, decreases nitric oxide production [3,4,5], stimulates
vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation [6,7], activates renin￾angiotensin system [8] and produces various inflammatory
mediators [9,10]. Studies have found an independent association
between hyperuricemia and hypertension, coronary heart disease,
ischemic stroke, chronic renal diseases and type 2 diabetes [11].
Hyperuricemia is common among kidney transplant recipients,
especially those on cyclosporine-based immunosuppressive regi￾mens [12]. The incidence of hyperuricemia in kidney transplant
patients, which was ,25% before the routine use of cyclosporine,
has increased to .80% with the widespread use of cyclosporine
[12]. Increased UA level has been shown to be predictive of
incident kidney disease and end-stage renal disease in those with
normal renal function and progression of disease in individuals
with kidney disease [13], while reduction of serum UA with
allopurinol has been associated with slowing of the progression of
renal disease [14]. Therefore, it has been proposed that
hyperuricemia may have clinical significance in RTRs, but studies
show conflicting results of the role of hyperuricemia in renal
allograft recipients. We conducted a systematic review and meta￾analysis of cohort studies to assess the association between serum
UA levels and graft function and survival after kidney transplan￾PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 June 2012 | Volume | Issue | e39457

tation in an effort to clarify whether early-onset hyperuricemia is
an independent predictor of long-term graft outcomes.
Methods
Searching
A comprehensive literature search was performed using
databases MEDLINE (Ovid) from1948 until June 2011, Medline
(R) in-process & other no-indexed citations (2011.5), EMBASE
from 1956 until June 2011 and CBM (Chinese Biomedicine
Database)from1978 until June 2011. The Medical Subject
Heading (MeSH) ‘urate’, ‘uric acid’, ‘hyperuric’, ‘hyperuricemia’,
‘gout’, ‘transplant’ , ‘transplantation’ and ‘graft’ were used as
English and corresponding Chinese search terms to identify studies
from above database. The search strategies were adjusted based on
the characteristics of each database. In addition, we searched the
reference lists of all identified relevant studies.
Selection
We only included prospective or retrospective cohort studies
investigating the association of hyperuricemia with RTRs’ kidney
function and long-term outcomes. Eligible studies must meet
following criteria: patients with age older than 18, maintained
intact renal function more than 6 months to minimize the effects of
decreased graft function on hyperuricemia, and only one kidney
transplanted. Patients were excluded if they had a history of
malignant tumor, acute inflammation, acute renal allograft
rejection and active liver disease.
Studies on drug trials, not published in English or Chinese,
letters and review articles, and studies without available data were
excluded.
Validity Assessment
Two reviewers rated the quality of the eligible studies
independently. Study quality was judged by using the NEW￾CASTLE-OTTAWA quality assessment scale. We assessed
included studies based on three aspects: the selection of the study
groups (0–4 points), the comparability of the groups (0–2 points),
and the ascertainment of either the exposure or outcome of
interest (0–3 points). The total score was 9. In case of
disagreement, consensus was achieved by discussion with a third
adjudicator.
Data Abstraction
Data were extracted by two reviewers independently. For each
study, we extracted information on author, publication year,
country, study design, sample size, age and sex of RTRs, the
definition of hyperuricemia, the length of follow-up and adjusted
factors. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and serum
creatinine (SCr) were as primary end-point, and CAN diagnosed
by biopsy and graft loss during follow-up were as secondary end￾point.
Quantitative Data Synthesis
Extracted information was put into a table to help us browse the
sample size, research design, quality and key features of each
included study.
RevMan5.0 was used to pool unadjusted odds ratio(OR) of
dichotomous variable, mean difference (MD) of continuous
variable and obtain their corresponding 95%CI while STATA10
was used to pool adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) and obtain 95%CI.
Chi-square test was used to assess the heterogeneity of included
studies. We adopted a p-value of #0.1 as evidence of heteroge￾neity. The random effects model was used to pool data if there was
heterogeneity, otherwise fixed effect model. A two-sided p value
less than 0.05 was regarded as significant for all analyses.
Subgroup analysis was performed to pool the effect size of
prospective and retrospective cohort studies separately. Sensitivity
analysis was performed by removing studies with distinctive
definition of hyperuricemia. Meta-regression was performed to
assess the effect of several clinical factors and study design on
outcomes.
Results
Flow of Included Studies
The primary search strategy identified 1417 articles. After
scanning the titles and abstracts, 1397 articles were excluded
(reasons stated in Figure 1). After reading the full text of remaining
studies and references tracing, 12 studies
[15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26] which met the inclusion
criteria were included in the review (Figure 1).
Study Characteristics and Quality
Table 1 summarized the characteristics of the included studies.
Among these studies, six were prospective and six were
retrospective cohort studies. The sample size ranged from 45 to
488. The studies were undertaken in U.S, China, Korea, Poland,
German, Canadian, Turkey and Saudi Arabia. Eight studies
[15,17,19,21,22,23,24,25] with 2045 participants assessed the
effects of UA on eGFR of RTRs; Five studies [18,20,21,22,23]
with 873 participants assessed the effects of UA on SCr of RTRs;
Five studies [19,20,21,22,24] with 1178 participants assessed the
effects of UA on CAN and 5 studies [15,16,22,24,26] with 1519
participants assessed the effects of UA on graft loss (including
death with functional graft). Follow-up time ranged from 1 to
10 years. All studies controlled the factors which had effects on

kidney function more or less, including age, race, sex, diabetes,
tumor, and medicines.
We assessed the quality of included studies critically using
NEWCASTLE – OTTAWA quality assessment scale. Two studies
[16,20] scored 9; two studies [17,18] scored 7; the rest scored 8
(table1). The subjects of all included studies were patients with
intact renal function for half a year after transplantation. Patients
with hyperuricemia or normal serum uric acid level were
comparable in baselines except 2 studies [17,18] which did not
report the relevant information. All studies except two [23,26]
described the definition of hyperuricemia. The follow-up of each
study was more than 1 year and the drop-out was described.
Hyperuricemia with eGFR
A total of 8 studies [15,17,19,21,22,23,24,25] provided data on
eGFR of RTRs with hyperuricemia versus normouricemia. There
was significant heterogeneity among studies (I
2= 95%,
p,0.00001). Random-effects meta-analysis showed that RTRs
with hyperuricemia had significantly lower eGFR than those with
normal serum uric acid level (MD = 211.24, 95% CI
216.34,26.14) (Figure 2).
We performed a subgroup analysis by pooling prospective and
retrospective studies separately and the results showed that there
were significant heterogeneity among both prospective cohort
studies (I2= 93%, p,0.0001) and retrospective cohort studies
(I
2= 85%, p,0.00001). Random-effects meta-analysis showed that
RTRs with hyperuricemia in both prospective and retrospective
studies had significantly lower eGFR than those with normal
serum uric acid level although the effect size of prospective cohort
studies (MD = 214.86, 95% CI 222.10,27.63) was larger than
that of retrospective cohort studies (MD = 29.99, 95% CI
215.00,24.98) (Figure 2).
Sensitivity analysis was performed by removing 3 studies
[22,23,24] with distinctive definition of hyperuricemia, there was
significant heterogeneity among studies (I
2= 95%, p ,0.00001).
Random-effects meta-analysis still showed that RTRs with
hyperuricemia had significantly lower eGFR than those with
normal serum uric acid level (MD = 213.48, 95% CI
219.15,27. 81).
A random model meta-regression analysis was performed using
the indicators of follow-up, race, definition of hyperuricemia, study
type (P = 0.0016). This led to a relative decrease in heterogeneity
(R2= 100%) with the residual of 0.00%. Meta-regression analysis
disclosed significant interactions between race (b = 28.492514,
P = 0.002), study type (b = 5.035018, P = 0.013), definition of
hyperuricemia (b = 10.0255, P = 0.006), and follow-up
(b = 13.37142, P = 0.002).
Hyperuricemia with SCr
We pooled the data of SCr of RTRs with hyperuricemia versus
normouricemia in 5 studies [18,20,21,22,23]. There was no
heterogeneity among these studies (I
2= 44%, P = 0.13). Fixed￾effect model meta-analysis showed that RTRs with hyperuricemia
had significant higher SCr than those with normal serum uric acid
level (MD = 0.24, 95%CI 0.17,0.31) (Figure 3).

Hyperuricemia with CAN
The number of patients who developed CAN during the follow￾up was available in 4 studies [19,20,21,22]. There was no
statistical significant heterogeneity among these studies (I
2= 26%,
p = 0.26). Fixed-effect model meta-analysis showed that RTRs
with hyperuricemia had significantly higher risk of developing
CAN than those with normal serum uric acid level (unadjusted
OR = 2.85, 95%CI 1.85,4.38) (Figure 4).
Two studies [19,24] reported the adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of
hyperuricemia with CAN of RTRs. There was no heterogeneity
among the studies (I
2= 0.0%, P = 0.444). Fixed-effect model meta￾analysis showed that hyperuricemia was an independent risk factor
of CAN of RTRs (aHR = 1.65, 95%CI 1.02,2.65) (Table 2).
Hyperuricemia with Graft Loss
Three studies [15,16,22] reported the number of patients who
suffered from graft loss. There was no heterogeneity among the
studies(I
2= 0%, P = 0.79). Fixed-effect model meta-analysis
showed that RTRs with hyperuricemia had significantly higher
risk of graft loss than those with normal serum uric acid level
(unadjusted OR = 2.29, 95%CI 1.55,3.39) (Figure 5).
Three studies [15,22,24] reported the aHR of hyperuricemia
with graft loss of RTRs. There was no heterogeneity among the
studies(I
2= 0.0%, P = 0.949). Fixed-effect model meta-analysis
showed that hyperuricemia was an independent risk factor of
graft loss of RTRs (aHR = 2.01, 95%CI 1.39,2.94) (Table 2).
Three studies [15,22,26] reported the aHR of increase 1 mg/dl
uric acid with graft loss of RTRs. There was no heterogeneity
among the studies (I
2= 0.0%, P = 0.649). Fixed-effect model meta￾analysis showed that uric acid was positively associated with graft
loss of RTRs independently (aHR = 1.21, 95%CI 1.08,1.37)
(Table 2).
Discussion
Relationship of Hyperuricemia with Kidney Function of
RTRs
Studies reported that UA may induce graft dysfunction, chronic
allograft nephropathy and accelerate the progress of the chronic
kidney disease through triggering inflammation, affecting vascular
endothelial function and inducing microvascular injury. Intracel￾lular uric acid could trigger oxidative stress reaction; activate
inflammatory mediators such as interleukin-6, tumor necrosis
factor-a, C-reactive protein [3,4,9,10] and renin-angiotensin
systems that finally lead to vascular endothelial dysfunction and
microvascular injury [27,28].
Our review found that eGFR in the hyperuricemia group was
significantly lower than that in normouricemia group while the
SCr level in the hyperuricemia group was significantly higher than
that in normouricemia group. Both unadjusted and adjusted
pooled effect size showed that the incidence rate of CAN and graft
loss in hyperuricemia group was significantly higher than that in
the normouricemia group, implying that hyperuricemia may be an
independent risk factor of graft dysfunction and could modestly
increase the risk of poor outcomes of kidney transplant receptors.

Hyperuricemia with Kidney Transplantation
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 5 June 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 6 | e39457

Clinical trials about the effects of urate-lowering therapy on
kidney transplant recipients can provide direct evidence that
higher uric acid is an independent risk factor of poor prognosis of
renal transplant recipients. RCT performed by Goicoechea et al
suggested that urate-lowering therapy slowed down renal disease
progression of patients with chronic kidney disease (In the control
group, eGFR decreased 3.3 6 1.2 ml/min per 1.73 m(2), and in
the allopurinol group, eGFR increased 1.36 1.3 ml/min per
1.73 m(2) after 24 months) [29]. However, there are only 2 trials
[30,31] reported the effects of urate-lowering therapy on kidney
transplant patients. Navascues et al reported that it is safe to use
allopurinol to low hyperuricemia of kidney transplant recipients,
but the SCr didn’t change significantly after treat￾ment(2.3560.92 mg/dl vs. 2.3961.03 mg/dl) [31]. Flury et al
compared the effects of allopurinol vs. benzbromarone in the
treatment of hyperuricemia after kidney transplantation, both
drugs effectively lowered serum uric acid concentrations by 19%
vs. 35% of pretreatment values [30]. Unfortunately, there is no
evidence to suggest that the allograft function of patients with
urate-lowering therapy is better than that of kidney transplant
recipients without urate-lowering drug. Therefore, high quality
evidence is needed to show that decreased uric acid level is related
to good prognosis of kidney transplant recipients.
Hyperuricemia and Graft Dysfunction, Cause or Effects?
Kidney is an important metabolic pathway of uric acid. When
kidney function is compromised, the excretion of uric acid
decreases while the level of serum uric acid increases. One study
reported that renal dysfunction is associated with higher UA levels,
but higher UA levels is not parallel with the progression of renal
dysfunction independently after kidney transplantation [32]. Min
et al found that recipients in the early-onset hyperuricemia (within
1 year after transplantation) had a stable graft function. The eGFR
are 58.7610.8, 58.9611.5 and 58.8610.7 ml/min/1.73 m2
,
respectively at detection of hyperuricemia, at 6 months post￾detection, and at 12 months post-detection [24]. Chung et al
found that UA-level of RTRs increased from 5.361.9 mg/dl to
6.361.7 mg/dl within 3 months post-transplant, but the eGFR
didn’t change significantly. The 1-year eGFR was significantly
lower in the hyperuricemic group (68.3 86 20.4 ml/min/1.73 m2
)
than that in the normouricemic group (77.9 8619.2 ml/min/
1.73 m2
) (p = 0.000) [15]. Haririan et al found that RTRs with
hyperuricemia during early post transplant period had significantly
higher 1-year SCr, lower eGFR, and worse graft survival when
compared with those with normal mean 6-month UA values [22].
The results of above studies in combination with our meta-analysis
indicated that hyperuricemia may be an independent risk factor of
graft dysfunction and may affect the life span of recipients of
kidney transplantation.
Dose-response Association of Uric Acid Level with Graft
Function
Min et al found that early-onset moderate-to-severe hyperuri￾cemia (defined as UA$8.0 mg/dl) was found to be a significant
risk factor for CAN (P = 0.035) and a poorer graft survival
(P = 0.026) by multivariate analysis, but not mild hyperuricemia.
In moderate-to-severe hyperuricemia group, the mean
eGFRMDRD (Modification of Diet in Renal Disease) at the
fourth post-transplant year were significantly lower than those at
1 year post-transplant(53.7615.2 vs. 61.9612.5). The impact of
hyperuricemia on RTRs was dependent on the duration of
exposure. Likewise, the detrimental effect of early-onset hyperuri￾cemia on the graft function was dependent on UA-level and
exposure time. After control of the baseline graft function by
analysis of only recipients with a good graft function at 1 year post￾transplantation (eGFR . 60 ml/min), moderate-to-severe early￾onset hyperuricemia was also a marker of long-term graft
dysfunction and failure [24]. Haririan et al found that higher
UA level had significant higher risk of graft loss compared to lower
UA level. Each 1 mg/dL increase of UA level was associated with
a 15% increase on average in the risk of graft loss during the study
period and seemed to be associated with increased risk of death
[26]. These two studies suggested that both higher UA-level and
longer duration of exposure have severe impacts on graft function.
Advantages and Limitations
This meta-analysis has some advantages. First, the samples of
included cohort studies came from Korea, China, Canada,
Poland, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, USA and German that would
have a good representative of race. Second, the effect of
Hyperuricemia on renal function is consistent regardless of
whether other confounding factors were adjusted or not. Third,
the included studies have moderate to high quality and good
internal validity.
Limitations of this study should be noted. First, the included
studies had potential risk of bias due to differences in complete
reporting of follow-up and judgment of outcomes. Second,
although included study adjusted confounding factors relevant to
renal function more or less, the number and types of adjusted
factors were different. There are maybe residual confounding
factors which have effects on outcomes. However, the pooled
estimates found that no matter confounding factors adjusted or un￾adjusted, no matter how many confounding factors were adjusted,
the conclusion that hyperuricemia is a risk factor of graft
dysfunction and poor prognosis is consistent. Third, as the sample

size of this meta-analysis was small, we can’t get the definitive
conclusions. Fourth, our review only included studies which have
been published in English or Chinese and did not search grey
literature, publication bias may exist. We could not assess the
publication bias precisely due to the limited number of included
studies for each outcome (,10).
Conclusions and Implications for Clinical Practice and
Research
Our systematic review shows that hyperuricemia has effects on
eGFR and SCr of RTRs and hyperuricemia may be an
independent risk factor of CAN and graft loss. Because this
review is based on observational studies, the number of included
studies and the sample size are limited and uric acid lowering
drugs have potential bad effects on kidney function, the
application of uric acid lowering drugs for RTRs with hyperuri￾cemia is not yet routinely recommended. Future cohort studies
need pay more attention to the representative of study people, the
comparable baselines of different groups, the adjustment of
confounding factors, long-term follow-up and assessment of
outcomes. High quality clinical trials are needed to verify whether
reducing the serum uric acid level can delay the kidney
dysfunction after kidney transplantation, the process of chronic
allograft nephropathy and the death of RTRs, and to provide basis
for the reasonable application of uric acid lowering drugs.
