Abstract
Background: Establishing who is at risk from a 
novel rapidly arising cause of death, and why, 
requires a new approach to epidemiological 
research with very large datasets and timely 
data. Working on behalf of NHS England we 
therefore set out to deliver a secure and 
pseudonymised analytics platform inside the 
data centre of a major primary care electronic 
health records vendor establishing coverage 
across detailed primary care records for a 
substantial proportion of all patients in England. 
The following results are preliminary.
Data sources: Primary care electronic health 
records managed by the electronic health 
record vendor TPP, pseudonymously linked to 
patient-level data from the COVID-19 Patient 
Notification System (CPNS) for death of 
hospital inpatients with confirmed COVID-19, 
using the new OpenSAFELY platform.
Population: 17,425,445 adults. 
Time period: 1st Feb 2020 to 25th April 2020.
Primary outcome: Death in hospital among 
people with confirmed COVID-19. 
Methods: Cohort study analysed by Cox￾regression to generate hazard ratios: age and 
sex adjusted, and multiply adjusted for co￾variates selected prospectively on the basis of 
clinical interest and prior findings.
Results: There were 5683 deaths attributed to 
COVID-19. In summary after full adjustment, 
death from COVID-19 was strongly associated 
with: being male (hazard ratio 1.99, 95%CI 
1.88-2.10); older age and deprivation (both with 
a strong gradient); uncontrolled diabetes (HR 
2.36 95% CI 2.18-2.56); severe asthma (HR 
1.25 CI 1.08-1.44); and various other prior 
medical conditions. Compared to people with 
ethnicity recorded as white, black people were 
at higher risk of death, with only partial 
attenuation in hazard ratios from the fully 
adjusted model (age-sex adjusted HR 2.17 
95% CI 1.84-2.57; fully adjusted HR 1.71 95% 
CI 1.44-2.02); with similar findings for Asian 
people (age-sex adjusted HR 1.95 95% CI 
1.73-2.18; fully adjusted HR 1.62 95% CI 1.43-
1.82). 
Conclusions: We have quantified a range of 
clinical risk factors for death from COVID-19, 
some of which were not previously well 
characterised, in the largest cohort study 
conducted by any country to date. People from 
Asian and black groups are at markedly 
increased risk of in-hospital death from COVID￾19, and contrary to some prior speculation this 
is only partially attributable to pre-existing 
clinical risk factors or deprivation; further 
research into the drivers of this association is 
therefore urgently required. Deprivation is also 
a major risk factor with, again, little of the 
excess risk explained by co-morbidity or other 
risk factors. The findings for clinical risk factors 
are concordant with policies in the UK for 
protecting those at highest risk. Our 
OpenSAFELY platform is rapidly adding further 
NHS patients’ records; we will update and
extend these results regularly.

Introduction
On March 11th 2020, the World Health 
Organisation characterised COVID-19 as a 
pandemic after 118,000 cases and 4,291 
deaths were reported in 114 countries.1 As 
of 30 April, cases are over 3 million 
globally, with more than 200,000 deaths 
attributed to the virus.2
In the UK, cases 
have reached 171,253, with 22,791 deaths 
in hospital.3
Age and gender are well-established 
risk factors, with over 90% of UK deaths to 
date being in people aged over 60 years, 
and 60% of deaths in men,4 consistent with 
global patterns. Various pre-existing 
conditions have been reported to correlate 
with increased risk of poor outcomes. In a 
re-analysis of a large aggregated case 
series dataset from the Chinese center for 
disease control and prevention (44,672 
patients, 1,023 deaths), cardiovascular 
disease, hypertension, diabetes, 
respiratory disease, and cancers were all 
associated with increased risk of death.5
These factors often correlate with age, but 
correction for age was not possible in the 
available data. More recently, a large UK 
cross-sectional survey describing 16,749 
patients already hospitalised with COVID￾19 showed higher risk of death for patients 
with cardiac, pulmonary and kidney 
disease, as well as malignancy, dementia 
and obesity (hazard ratios 1.19-1.39 after
age and sex correction).6 Obesity has been 
reported as a risk factor for treatment 
escalation in a French ITU cohort (n=124) 
and a New York hospital presentation 
cohort (n=3615).7,8 The risks associated 
with smoking are disputed: increased risks 
were initially reported; recent studies 
suggest that smokers are under￾represented among those with more 
severe disease; and a potential protective 
mechanism for nicotine has been 
suggested.9 Smoking prevalence among 
hospitalised patients was lower than 
expected in China (1,099 patients, 12.6%
vs 28% in the general population),10 and in 
a small French study (139 outpatients and 
343 inpatients; Standardized Incidence 
Ratios 0.197 and 0.246, respectively).11
People from black and minority ethnic 
(BME) groups are at increased risk of bad 
outcomes from COVID-19, but 
explanations for this association are 
unclear.12,13
We therefore set out to determine 
factors associated with risk of death from 
COVID-19 in England using a very large 
sample of the adult population, with deaths 
data linked to longitudinal primary care 
electronic health records. This is the first 
iteration, based on the currently available 
data; further updates and additional 
outcomes will be released as more data 
become available through the 
OpenSAFELY.org platform.
Methods
Study design 
We conducted a cohort study using 
national primary care electronic health 
record data linked to in-hospital COVID-19 
death data (see Data Source). The cohort 
study began on 1st February 2020, chosen 
as a date several weeks prior to the first 
reported COVID-19 deaths and the day 
after the second laboratory confirmed 
case;14 and ended on 25th April 2020. The 
cohort explores risk among the general 
population rather than in a population 
infected with SARS-COV-2. Therefore, all 
patients were included irrespective of their 
SARS-COV-2 test results. 
Data Source 
We used patient data from general practice 
(GP) records managed by the GP software 
provider The Phoenix Partnership (TPP), 
linked to COVID-19 inpatient hospital 
death notifications (CPNS) from NHSE/X, 
and Office for National Statistics (ONS) 
death data. CPNS provides the most 
current information on deaths of inpatients

with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 
occurring within NHS hospitals;15,16
whereas ONS includes information on all 
deaths, including those due to non-COVID￾19 causes, and was used for censoring. 
The data were accessed, linked and 
analysed using OpenSAFELY, a new data 
analytics platform created to address 
urgent questions relating to the 
epidemiology and treatment of COVID-19 
in England. OpenSAFELY provides a 
secure software interface that allows 
detailed pseudonymised primary care 
patient records to be analysed in near real￾time where they already reside, hosted 
within the EHR vendor’s highly secure data 
centre, to minimise the re-identification 
risks when data are transported off-site; 
other smaller datasets are linked to these 
data within the same environment using a 
matching pseudonym derived from the 
NHS number. More information can be 
found on https://opensafely.org/.
The dataset analysed with 
OpenSAFELY for this paper is based on 24 
million currently registered patients 
(approximately 40% of the English 
population) from GP surgeries using the 
TPP SystmOne electronic health record 
system. It extends to 20 billion rows of 
structured data characterising (for 
example) pseudonymised patients’ 
diagnoses, medications, physiological 
parameters, and prior investigations. Data 
extracted from TPP SystmOne have 
previously been used in medical research, 
as part of the ResearchOne dataset.17,18
 
Study Population and Observation Period
Our study population consisted of all adults 
(males and females 18 years and above) 
currently registered as active patients in a 
TPP general practice in England on 1st 
February 2020. To be included in the study, 
participants were required to have at least 
1 year of prior follow-up in the GP practice 
to ensure that baseline patient 
characteristics could be adequately 
captured, and to have a recorded sex and 
age.19 Patients were observed from the 1st 
of February 2020 and were followed until 
the first of either their death date (whether 
COVID-19 related or due to other causes) 
or the study end date, 25th April 2020. For 
this analysis, CPNS death data were 
available up to 25th April 2020; ONS death 
data (used for censoring individuals who 
died without the outcome) were available 
to 16th April 2020; patient censoring for 
deaths due to other causes was therefore 
not possible during the last 9 days of 
followup (see Discussion, weaknesses; a 
sensitivity analysis is presented with all 
data censored at 6th April 2020 in 
appendix Table A1).
Outcomes 
The outcome was in-hospital death among 
people with confirmed COVID-19, 
ascertained from the COVID-19 Patient 
Notification System (CPNS). 
Covariates
Potential risk factors included: health 
conditions listed in UK guidance on “higher 
risk” groups;20 other common conditions 
which may cause immunodeficiency 
inherently or through medication (cancer 
and common autoimmune conditions); and 
emerging risk factors for severe outcomes 
among COVID-19 cases (such as raised 
blood pressure). 
Age, sex, body mass index (BMI; 
kg/m2
), and smoking status were 
considered as potential risk factors. Where 
categorised, age groups were: 18-<40, 40-
<50, 50-<60, 60-<70, 70-<80, 80+ years. 
BMI was ascertained from weight 
measurements within the last 10 years, 
restricted to those taken when the patient 
was over 16 years old. Obesity was 
grouped using categories derived from the 
World Health Organisation classification of 
BMI: no evidence of obesity <30 kg/m2
; 
obese I 30-34.9; obese II 35-39.9; obese III 
40+. Smoking status was grouped into 
current, former and never smokers 
The following comorbidities were also 
considered potential risk factors: asthma, 
other chronic respiratory disease, chronic 
heart disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic

liver disease, chronic neurological 
diseases, common autoimmune diseases 
(Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), Systemic Lupus 
Erythematosus (SLE) or psoriasis), solid 
organ transplant, asplenia, other 
immunosuppressive conditions, cancer, 
evidence of reduced kidney function, and 
raised blood pressure or a diagnosis of 
hypertension.
Disease groupings followed national 
guidance on risk of influenza infection,21
therefore “chronic respiratory disease 
(other than asthma)” included COPD, 
fibrosing lung disease, bronchiectasis or 
cystic fibrosis; chronic heart disease 
included chronic heart failure, ischaemic 
heart disease, and severe valve or 
congenital heart disease likely to require 
lifelong follow up. Chronic neurological 
conditions were separated into diseases 
with a likely cardiovascular aetiology 
(stroke, TIA, dementia) and conditions in 
which respiratory function may be 
compromised such as motor neurone 
disease, myasthenia gravis, multiple 
sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, cerebral 
palsy, quadriplegia or hemiplegia, 
malignant primary brain tumour, and 
progressive cerebellar disease. Asplenia 
included splenectomy or a spleen 
dysfunction, including sickle cell disease. 
Other immunosuppressive conditions 
included HIV or a condition inducing 
permanent immunodeficiency ever 
diagnosed, or aplastic anaemia or 
temporary immunodeficiency recorded 
within the last year. Haematological 
malignancies were considered separately
from other cancers to reflect the 
immunosuppression associated with 
haematological malignancies and their 
treatment. Kidney function was 
ascertained from the most recent serum 
creatinine measurement, where available, 
converted into estimated glomerular 
filtration rate (eGFR) using the Chronic 
Kidney Disease Epidemiology 
Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation,22 with 
impaired kidney function defined as eGFR 
<60 mL/min/1.73m2
. Raised blood 
pressure (BP) was defined as either a prior 
coded diagnosis of hypertension or the 
most recent recording indicating systolic BP 
≥140 mmHg or diastolic BP ≥90 mmHg.
Asthma was grouped by use of oral 
corticosteroids as an indication of severity. 
Diabetes was grouped according to the 
most recent Hba1c measurement, where a 
measurement was available within the last 
15 months, into controlled (Hba1c < 58 
mmols/mol) and uncontrolled (Hba1c >= 
58 mmols/mol). Cancer was grouped by 
time since the first diagnosis (within the last 
year, 2-<5 years, >5 years).
Other covariates considered as 
potential upstream risk factors were 
deprivation and ethnicity. Deprivation was 
measured by the Index of Multiple 
Deprivation (IMD, in quintiles, with higher 
values indicating greater deprivation), 
derived from the patient’s postcode at 
lower super output area level for a high 
degree of precision. Ethnicity was grouped 
into White, Black, Asian or Asian British, 
Mixed, or Other. The Sustainability and 
Transformation Partnership (STP, an NHS 
administrative region) of the patient’s 
general practice was included as an 
additional adjustment for geographical 
variation in infection rates across the 
country.
Information on all covariates were 
obtained from primary care records by 
searching TPP SystmOne records for 
specific coded data. TPP SystmOne allows 
users to work with the SNOMED-CT 
clinical terminology, using a GP subset of 
SNOMED-CT codes. This subset maps on 
to the native Read version 3 (CTV3) clinical 
coding system that SystmOne is built on. 
Medicines are entered or prescribed in a 
format compliant with the NHS Dictionary 
of Medicines and Devices (dm+d),23 a local 
UK extension library of SNOMED. Code 
lists for particular underlying conditions 
and medicines were compiled from a 
variety of sources. These include BNF
codes from OpenPrescribing.net, 
published codelists for asthma,24–26
immunosuppression,27–29 psoriasis,30

SLE,31 RA32,33 and cancer,34,35 and Read 
Code 2 lists designed specifically to 
describe groups at increased risk of 
influenza infection.36 Read Code 2 lists 
were added to with SNOMED codes and 
cross-checked against NHS QOF 
registers, then translated into CTV3 with 
manual curation. Decisions on every code 
list were documented and final lists 
reviewed by at least two authors. Detailed 
information on compilation and sources for 
every individual codelist is available at 
https://codelists.opensafely.org/ and the 
lists are available for inspection and re-use 
by the broader research community.37
Statistical Analysis
Patient numbers are depicted in figure 1. 
The Kaplan-Meier failure function by age 
group and sex are shown in figure 2. For 
each potential risk factor, a Cox 
proportional hazards model was fitted, with 
days in study as the timescale, stratified by 
geographic area (STP), and adjusted for 
sex and age modelled using restricted 
cubic splines. Violations of the proportional 
hazards assumption were explored by 
testing for a zero slope in the scaled 
Schoenfeld residuals. All potential risk 
factors, including age (again modelled as a 
spline), sex, BMI, smoking, index of 
multiple deprivation quintile, and 
comorbidities listed above were then 
included in a single multivariable Cox 
proportional hazards model, stratified by 
STP. Hazard ratios from the age/sex 
adjusted and fully adjusted models are 
reported with 95% confidence intervals. 
Models were also refitted with age group 
fitted as a categorical variable in order to 
obtain hazard ratios by age group. 
In the primary analysis, those with 
missing BMI were assumed non-obese 
and those with missing smoking 
information were assumed to be non￾smokers on the assumption that both 
obesity and smoking would be likely to be 
recorded if present. A sensitivity analysis 
was run among those with complete BMI 
and smoking data only. Ethnicity was 
omitted from the main multivariable model 
due to 26% of individuals having missing 
data; hazard ratios for ethnicity were 
therefore obtained from a separate model 
among individuals with complete ethnicity 
only. Hazard ratios for other risk factors, 
adjusted for ethnicity, were also obtained 
from this model and are presented in the 
sensitivity analyses to allow assessment of 
the potential for confounding by ethnicity in 
the primary model. All multivariable models
excluded the very small number of patients 
(<1%) with missing IMD. 
The C-statistic was calculated as a 
measure of model discrimination. Due to 
computational time, this was estimated by 
randomly sampling 5000 patients without 
the outcome and calculating the C-statistic 
using the random sample and all patients 
who experienced the outcome, repeating 
this 10 times and taking the average C￾statistic. 
Information governance and ethics
NHS England is the data controller; TPP is 
the data processor; and the key 
researchers on OpenSAFELY are acting on 
behalf of NHS England. This 
implementation of OpenSAFELY is hosted 
within the TPP environment which is 
accredited to the ISO 27001 information 
security standard and is NHS IG Toolkit 
compliant;38,39 patient data has been
pseudonymised for analysis and linkage 
using industry standard cryptographic 
hashing techniques; all pseudonymised 
datasets transmitted for linkage onto 
OpenSAFELY are encrypted; access to the 
platform is via a virtual private network 
(VPN) connection, restricted to a small 
group of researchers, their specific 
machine and IP address; the researchers 
hold contracts with NHS England and only 
access the platform to initiate database 
queries and statistical models; all database 
activity is logged; only aggregate statistical 
outputs leave the platform environment 
following best practice for anonymisation 
of results such as statistical disclosure 
control for low cell counts.40 The

OpenSAFELY research platform adheres 
to the data protection principles of the UK 
Data Protection Act 2018 and the EU 
General Data Protection Regulation 
(GDPR) 2016. In March 2020, the Secretary 
of State for Health and Social Care used 
powers under the UK Health Service 
(Control of Patient Information) Regulations 
2002 (COPI) to require organisations to 
process confidential patient information for 
the purposes of protecting public health, 
providing healthcare services to the public 
and monitoring and managing the COVID￾19 outbreak and incidents of exposure.41
Taken together, these provide the legal 
bases to link patient datasets on the 
OpenSAFELY platform. This study was 
approved by the Health Research Authority 
(REC reference 20/LO/0651) and by the 
LSHTM Ethics Board (reference 21863). 
Software and Reproducibility
Data management was performed using 
Python 3.8 and SQL, with analysis carried 
out using Stata 16.1 / Python. All code for 
data management and analysis is archived 
online at 
https://github.com/ebmdatalab/opensafel
y-risk-factors-research. All clinical and 
medicines codelists are openly available 
for inspection and reuse at

Patient and Public Involvement
Patients were not formally involved in 
developing this specific study design. We 
have developed a publicly available 
website https://opensafely.org/ allowing 
any patient or member of the public to 
contact us regarding this study or the 
broader OpenSAFELY project. This 
feedback will be used to refine and 
prioritise our OpenSAFELY activities.
Results
17,425,445 adults were included (Figure 1). 
Table 1 shows distributions of 
demographics and baseline comorbidities. 
Figure 1. Flow diagram of cohort with numbers 
excluded at different stages and identification 
of cases for the main endpoints.
1,870,069 (11%) individuals had non-white 
ethnicities recorded. Missing data were 
present for body mass index (3,782,768, 
22%), smoking status (725,323, 4%), 
ethnicity (4,592,377, 26%), IMD (142,166, 
0.8%), and blood pressure (1,728,479, 
10%). 5683 of the individuals had a COVID￾19 hospital death recorded in CPNS.
The overall cumulative incidence of 
COVID-19 hospital death at 80 days from 
the study start date was <0.01% in those 
aged 18-39 years, rising to 0.35% and 
0.17% in men and women respectively 
aged ≥80 years, with a trend by age (Figure 
2).
Associations between patient-level 
factors and risk of COVID-19 hospital death 
are shown in Table 2 and Figure 3. 
Increasing age was strongly associated 
with risk, with the ≥80 years age group 
having more than 12-fold increased risk 
compared with those aged 50-59 years

(fully adjusted HR 12.64; 95% CI 11.19-
14.28). With age fitted as a flexible spline, 
an approximately log-linear relationship 
was observed (appendix Figure A1), 
equivalent to risk increasing exponentially 
with age. Male gender was associated with 
a doubling of risk (fully adjusted HR 1.99, 
1.88-2.10).
All non-white ethnic groups had higher 
risk than those with white ethnicity: HRs 
adjusted for age and sex only ranged from 
1.83-2.17 for Black, Asian/Asian British 
and mixed ethnicities compared to white; 
these attenuated to 1.62-1.71 on 
adjustment for all included risk factors. 
Increasing risks were seen with increasing 
levels of deprivation, and with increasing 
levels of obesity (BMI >40 fully adjusted HR 
2.27, 95% CI 1.99-2.58).
Both current and former smoking were 
associated with higher risk in models 
adjusted for age and sex only, but in the 
fully adjusted model there was weak 
evidence of a slightly lower risk in current 
smokers (fully adjusted HRs 0.88, CI 0.79-
0.99). In post-hoc analyses we added 
individual covariates to the model with age, 
sex and smoking to explore this further: the 
change in HR appeared to be largely driven 
by adjustment for chronic respiratory 
disease (HR 0.93, 0.83-1.04 after 
adjustment) and deprivation (HR 0.98, 
0.88-1.10 after adjustment). Other 
individual adjustments did not remove the 
positive association between current 
smoking and outcome. We also explored 
confounding by ethnicity, which was not 
adjusted in the primary model: among 
those with complete ethnicity, the current 
smoking HR adjusted for all variables 
except ethnicity was similar to in the full 
study population (0.88, 0.78-1.01) but this 
moved towards the null on adjustment for 
ethnicity (HR 0.94, 0.82-1.07).

increased risk up to 5 years from 
diagnosis, and nearly double the risk 
thereafter. For other cancers, HRs were 
smaller and risk increases were largely 
observed among those diagnosed in the 
last year. There was no association 
between hypertension (defined as a 
recorded diagnosis, or high blood pressure 
at the last measurement) and outcome (HR 
0.95, 0.89-1.01). However, in sensitivity 
analyses, diagnosed hypertension was 
associated with slightly increased risk (HR 
1.07, 1.00-1.15) while high blood pressure 
(≥140/90 mmHg) at the most recent 
measurement was associated with lower 
risk (HR 0.61, 0.56-0.67).

The average C-statistic was 0.78. 
Sensitivity analyses are shown in Table A1 
(appendix). Results were similar when 
restricted to those with complete BMI and 
smoking information, and when adjusted 
for ethnicity, among those with complete 
data. Violation of proportional hazards was 
detected in the primary model (p<0.001), 
so a further sensitivity analysis was run 
with earlier administrative censoring at 6th 
April 2020, since social distancing 
measures introduced across the UK in late 
March 2020 would not have been expected 
to impact on mortality rates at that time. 
There was no evidence of non-proportional 
hazards in this analysis (p=0.56). The 
overall pattern of results was similar to the 
primary model, though most HRs were 
somewhat larger in magnitude in the 
analysis restricted to this earlier period, 
while the effect of increasing deprivation 
appeared to be smaller (appendix Table 
A1).
Discussion
Summary
We have successfully delivered a secure 
analytics platform operating across almost 
24 million patient records for the Covid-19 
emergency, and used this to identify, 
quantify, and further explore a range of risk 
factors for death in hospital from COVID￾19 in the largest cohort study conducted by 
any country to date. Most comorbidities we 
studied were associated with increased 
risk, including cardiovascular disease, 
diabetes, respiratory disease including 
asthma, obesity, history of haematological 
malignancy or recent other cancer, kidney, 
liver, neurological and autoimmune 
conditions. People from Asian and black 
groups had a substantially higher risk of 
death from COVID-19, only partially 
attributable to co-morbidity, deprivation or 
other risk factors. Deprivation is also a 
major risk factor, which was only partly 
attributable to co-morbidity or other risk 
factors. 
Strengths and weaknesses
The greatest strengths of this study were 
speed and size. By building a secure 
analytics platform across routinely 
collected live clinical data stored in situ we 
have been able to produce timely results 
from the current records of approximately 
40% of the English population in response 
to a global health emergency. This scale 
allowed us to work with more precision, on 
rarer exposures, on multiple risk factors,
and to detect important signals as early as 
possible in the course of the pandemic. 
The scale of our platform will shortly 
expand further, and we will report updated 
analyses over time. Another key strength is 
our use of open methods: we pre-specified 
our analysis plan and have shared our full 
analytic code and all code lists for review 
and re-use. We ascertained patients’ 
demographics, medications and co￾morbidities from their full pseudonymised 
longitudinal primary care records, 
providing substantially more detailed 
information than is available in hospital 
records or data recorded at time of 
admission alone, and on the total 
population at risk rather than the selected 
subset presenting for treatment in hospital. 
Linkage to ONS allowed censoring of data 
in the control population for patients who 
had died outside hospital or from other 
causes. Analyses were stratified by area to 
account for known geographical 
differences in incidence of COVID-19.
We also identify important limitations. 
Using CPNS data alone relies on hospitals 
completing a new return under emergency 
conditions; furthermore COVID-19 deaths 
among people with false-negative tests 
and those untested may not have been 
included; we will validate CPNS against 
ONS data (which has a longer delay to 
reporting) as more cases arise. This initial 
analysis was focused on in-hospital death: 
our findings therefore reflect both an 
individual’s risk of infection, and their risk 
of dying once infected. We will explore 
patient trajectories in future research using 
test results and A&E presentation data

which are now being linked on the 
OpenSAFELY platform. 
Censoring patients at date of death 
from other causes, or outside hospital, was 
only possible until 16th April 2020, 9 days 
prior to study end. Rather than ending the 
study earlier, greatly reducing case 
numbers, we end at 25 April, 
acknowledging that censoring would be 
incomplete for the last 9 days. 
Consequently a small number of the 
sickest individuals, who died after being 
discharged from hospital, will have 
remained in the “at risk” group over the last 
few days of study time when they should 
be censored. This would most likely apply 
to those with risk factors present, and 
therefore attenuate HRs, but any impact is 
likely to be small: a sensitivity analysis with 
all data censored at 6 April showed minimal 
differences. 
Our analysis to date covers 40% of the 
population, but may not yet be fully 
representative as it currently includes only 
practices using the EHR software 
SystmOne: there is substantial geographic 
variation in choice of EHR system and in 
London, where many earlier COVID-19 
cases occurred, only 17% of general 
practices use SystmOne. Additionally it has 
been shown that the user interface of 
electronic health records can affect 
prescribing of certain medicines42–44 so it is 
possible that coding of conditions may 
vary between systems; again we will 
evaluate this further with more data.
Primary care records, though detailed 
and longitudinal, can be incomplete for 
data on risk factors and other covariates. In 
particular, ethnicity was not recorded in 
approximately 26% of patients included; 
prior research has shown that when 
ethnicity is recorded in EHR its distribution 
is very similar to that in census ethnicity 
data.45 Obesity and smoking were 
assumed absent if missing; patients with 
missing creatinine and blood pressure 
measurements were included in the 
categories denoting no evidence of 
reduced kidney function or high blood 
pressure respectively. We undertook a 
number of sensitivity analyses to assess 
robustness of these approaches, hazard 
ratios were similar across analyses. 
Deprivation score may be inaccurate for 
any patients without an up-to-date 
address, but this is unlikely to introduce a 
strong bias in any particular direction. 
Deviations from proportional hazards 
were detected. This could be partly or 
wholly due to the very large numbers 
included meaning small deviations are 
statistically significant, or due to 
unmeasured covariates. However, it may 
have been due to rapid changes in social 
behaviours following government advice 
on social distancing, shielding, and 
changes in the pattern and burden of 
infection across the UK, which may also 
have affected different patient groups 
differentially. A sensitivity analysis with 
early censoring at 6th April 2020 (before 
social distancing and shielding measures 
would be likely to affect mortality) showed 
no evidence of non-proportional hazards 
(p=0.56) and similar results to the primary 
model, but with larger hazard ratios for 
several risk factors. This is consistent with 
the hypothesis that the most at-risk 
patients may have been more compliant 
with social distancing and shielding 
policies introduced later. In contrast, the 
effect of increased deprivation appeared to 
be smaller in the earlier period, suggesting 
that the risk associated with deprivation 
may have increased over time. Subsequent 
analyses will explore different analytical 
approaches, including fitting interactions 
with time, and using accelerated failure 
time models, to further explore changes 
before and after national initiatives around 
COVID-19. 
Findings in Context
Our findings on age and gender are 
consistent with patterns observed 
worldwide in smaller studies on patients 
infected and/or dying from COVID-19. 
Compared to white people, people of Asian 
and Black ethnic origin were found to be at

a higher risk of death. Non-white ethnicity 
has previously been found to be 
associated with increased COVID-19 
infection and poor outcomes.12,13,46
Commentators and researchers have 
reasonably speculated that this might be 
due to higher prevalence of medical 
problems such as cardiovascular disease 
or diabetes among BME people, or higher 
deprivation. Our findings, based on more 
detailed data, show that this is only a small 
part of the excess risk. Other possible 
explanations for increased risk among 
BME groups relate to higher infection risk, 
including over-representation in ‘front-line” 
professions with higher exposure to 
infection, or higher household density. 
Addressing these questions will likely entail 
bespoke data collection on, for example, 
occupation among cases and controls. 
We also found a consistent pattern of 
increasing risk with greater deprivation, 
with the most deprived quintile having a HR 
of 1.75 compared to the least deprived, 
consistent with recent national statistics.47
Again, contrary to prior speculation, very 
little of the increased risk associated with 
deprivation was explained by pre-existing 
disease or clinical risk factors, suggesting 
that other social factors increase the risk of 
COVID-19 infection or death from infection. 
We found increased risk for the major 
included co-morbidities. The ISARIC study 
describing 16,749 hospitalised UK patients 
with COVID-19 also indicated increased 
risk of death among hospitalised patients 
with cardiac, pulmonary and kidney 
disease, malignancy and dementia.6
Cardiovascular disease, hypertension, 
diabetes, respiratory disease, and cancers 
were all associated with increased risk of 
death in a large Chinese study describing 
44,672 confirmed cases, but which lacked 
age-correction.5
Of particular note in our results is the 
association of asthma with higher risk of 
COVID-19 hospital death, with the HR 
increasing further for those having a recent 
oral corticosteroid (indicating greater 
severity of disease). This contrasts with 
previous findings: in several countries, 
asthma and other chronic respiratory 
diseases are underrepresented in 
hospitalised patients;48 and among the first 
few hundred cases in UK, a protective 
association with asthma was observed, 
although presence of asthma was 
ascertained differently for cases and 
controls which could be a source of bias.36
The ISARIC study reported 14% of 
hospitalised patients having asthma but no 
increased risk of death.6 However, in both 
the UK and China, COPD did appear to 
confer increased risk of death among 
hospitalised or confirmed cases, 
respectively.5,6 Our study design combines 
both risk of infection and risk of death once 
infected; it is also possible that our 
methodology captured more people with 
asthma and was better able to delineate 
more severe asthma than previous studies 
based on hospital records. We found no 
association between hypertension and 
death where hypertension was defined as 
a recorded diagnosis or high blood 
pressure at last measurement (HR 0.96, 
0.9-1.02). However when separated out in 
sensitivity analyses diagnosed 
hypertension was associated with slightly 
increased risk, whilst a high blood pressure 
measurement was associated with slightly 
reduced risk. Hypertension is very strongly 
associated with age and although we 
adjusted for this, disentangling the effects 
of each is difficult. 
We showed increasing risk of death 
with degree of obesity: fully-adjusted HR 
1.27 for BMI 30-34.9 kg/m2
, increasing to 
2.27 for BMI >=40 kg/m2
. Previous studies 
have shown increased risk with obesity 
among hospitalised patients: ISARIC, 
based on hospital survey data (2,212 
deaths), found a HR of 1.37 for death 
associated with clinician-reported obesity 
among 16,749 hospitalised patients, after 
age and sex correction (95% CI 1.16-
1.63)6

We found some evidence of increased 
risks in former smokers. In current smokers 
there was a slight protective effect, which 
was removed when fully adjusted for 
ethnicity. The risks associated with 
smoking have been disputed, with 
increased risks initially reported, but some 
more recent reports finding that smokers 
are under-represented in those with more 
severe disease, and a potential protective 
mechanism for nicotine has been 
suggested9,49: smoking prevalence was 
lower than expected among hospitalised 
patients in China,10 France11 and the USA.50
Even if smoking does have a small 
protective effects against COVID-19, this 
would still be massively outweighed by the 
well-established adverse health effects of 
smoking.
Policy Implications and Interpretation
The UK has a policy of recommending 
shielding (i.e. minimising face to face 
contact) for groups identified as being 
extremely vulnerable to COVID-19 on the 
basis of pre-existing medical conditions. 
We were able to evaluate the association 
between most of these conditions and 
death from COVID-19, and confirm that 
people with these conditions do have 
substantially increased mortality risk, 
supporting the shielding strategy. We have 
demonstrated - for the first time - that only 
a small part of the substantially increased 
risks of death from COVID-19 among non￾white groups and among people living in 
more deprived areas can be attributed to 
existing disease. Improved strategies to 
protect people in these groups from 
COVID-19 need urgent consideration. 
The UK has an unusually large volume 
of very detailed longitudinal patient data, 
especially through primary care. We 
believe the UK has a responsibility to the 
global community to make good use of this 
data, securely, and to the highest scientific 
standards. OpenSAFELY demonstrates 
the value of this data in practice. We will 
enhance the OpenSAFELY platform to 
further inform the global response to the 
COVID-19 emergency. 
Future Research
The underlying causes of higher risk 
among those from non-white 
backgrounds, and deprived areas, require 
further exploration; we would suggest 
collecting data on occupational exposure 
and living conditions as first steps. The 
statistical power offered by our approach 
means that associations with less common 
risk factors can be robustly assessed in 
more detail, at the earliest possible date, as 
the pandemic progresses. We will 
therefore update our findings and address 
smaller risk groups as new cases arise over 
time. The open source re-usable codebase 
on OpenSAFELY supports rapid, secure 
and collaborative development of new 
analyses: we are currently conducting 
expedited studies on the impact of various 
medical treatments and population 
interventions on the risk of COVID-19 
infection, ITU admission, and death, 
alongside other observational analyses. 
OpenSAFELY is rapidly scalable for 
additional NHS patients’ records, with new 
data sources progressing. 
Conclusion
We report early data on risk factors for 
death from COVID-19 using an 
unprecedented scale of 17 million patients’ 
detailed primary care records in the 
context of a global health emergency; we 
will update our findings as new data arises.
