One of the most common tumors in the world is hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and its
mortality rates are still on the rise, so addressing it is considered an important challenge for
universal health. Despite the various treatments that have been developed over the past
decades, the prognosis for advanced liver cancer is still poor. Recently, tumor
immunotherapy has opened new opportunities for suppression of tumor progression,
recurrence, and metastasis. Besides this, investigation into this malignancy due to high
immune checkpoint expression and the change of immunometabolic programming in
immune cells and tumor cells is highly considered. Because anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte–
associated protein (CTLA)-4 antibodies and anti-programmed cell death protein (PD)-1
antibodies have shown therapeutic effects in various cancers, studies have shown that T
cell immunoglobulin mucin-3 (TIM-3), a new immune checkpoint molecule, plays an
important role in the development of HCC. In this review, we summarize the recent
findings on signal transduction events of TIM-3, its role as a checkpoint target for HCC
therapy, and the immunometabolic situation in the progression of HCC.

INTRODUCTION
Primary liver cancer is the sixth most frequent type of cancer and the second or third most common
cause of cancer-related death globally with about 782,500 deaths per year. The term “hepatobiliary
cancer” refers to primary malignancies in the liver, either hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or the
intra- and extra-hepatic biliary ductal system, giving rise to biliary tract carcinomas (BTC). HCC is
the predominant type of primary liver cancer, which comprises approximately 90% of cases,
whereas BTCs are rare tumors (1–3). Surgery plays a substantial role in the cure in the early stages of
the disease and is restricted to a minority of patients with localized diseases; however, most HCC
patients are diagnosed at advanced stages when therapeutic options are limited, and apart from
locoregional or systemic therapies, recurrence happens in most of them within 5 years. Currently,
sorafenib and lenvatinib, which are oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors, as the first-line treatment have
shown efficacy in late stages of HCC and provide a short increase of median overall survival for

patients. Also, other angiogenesis inhibitors, such as
cabozantinib; regorafenib; and ramucirumab, a monoclonal
antibody directed against the vascular endothelial growth
factor receptor (VEGFR2), are second-line therapeutic options
(1, 4).
Despite the various treatments that have been developed over
the past decades, the prognosis for advanced liver cancer is still
poor. Therefore, new approaches are needed to treat liver cancer
(5, 6). In recent years, tumor immunotherapy has been proposed
as a promising method for suppression of tumor progression,
recurrence, and metastasis (3). In particular, most recent studies
have focused on the role of the immune system in HCC (1).
“Immunometabolism” is a term that has been recently proposed,
and it points to the functional intracellular metabolic changes
that occur within different immune cells. Understanding the
immunometabolic situation of T lymphocytes and other immune
cells, along with the metabolic behavior of cancer cells, can help
us to design new therapeutic approaches against cancers (3, 5).
On the other hand, the role of the immune system and immune
checkpoint inhibitors in HCC is taken into consideration in
recent studies, and they have shown significant progress in the
last few years (1, 2). Accordingly, one of the main strategies to
improve the specific immune response to the tumor is to use
monoclonal antibodies to block the immune checkpoint (1, 3).
The most recognized immune checkpoint proteins include
cytotoxic T lymphocyte–associated protein 4 (CTLA-4),
programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), PD-L1, V-domain Ig
suppressor of T cell activation (VISTA), T cell immunoglobulin
and mucin domain-containing protein 3 (TIM-3), lymphocyte
activating 3 (LAG-3), and OX40. Among these, CTLA-4 and PD￾1 inhibitors have been well characterized and are approved by the
FDA for treating melanomas with some progress for application
in treating HCC (3). Apart from important results that have
already been obtained by some studies on immunotherapy for
HCC, future studies must present more specific immune targets
and novel immune checkpoints (3). TIM-3 is a less investigated
immune checkpoint molecule that plays important and complex
roles in regulating immune responses and in inducing immune
tolerance (7). Therefore, investigating the expression pattern and
the detailed role of TIM-3 in the metabolic alteration of tumor￾infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) as well as the tumor cells of HCC
is of critical importance in finding more specific and effective
therapeutic approaches in the future. Here, we review
the cutting-edge findings of signal transduction events in TIM￾3, its role as a checkpoint target for HCC therapy, and
its immunometabolic situation in the progression of HCC.
This would help in understanding whether the TIM-3
immunometabolic checkpoint molecule could be recognized as
a potential target for HCC therapy or not.
THE STRUCTURE OF TIM-3 AS A
CHECKPOINT MOLECULE
Innate and adaptive immune cell activation is highly regulated by
a series of surface receptor–ligand pairs or immune checkpoints
that affect signaling events. Because these molecules have a key
role in T cell activation, tolerance, and exhaustion, nowadays,
their therapeutic modulation provides effective new treatment
strategies in infectious diseases, autoimmunity, allogeneic
transplantation, and cancer (8). Although substantial clinical
responses have been achieved in cancer patients treated with
antibodies against the CTLA-4 and PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoints,
only a small portion of patients have responded to such therapies
in several cancers. Thus, exploring novel co-inhibitory molecules
and immune checkpoints for cancer treatment is urgently
required, and TIM-3 is a potential candidate (9–11).
The TIM gene family, which includes 8 members (TIM-1 to
-8) in mice on chromosome 11B1.1 and 3 members (TIM-1,
TIM-3, and TIM-4) in humans on chromosome 5q33.2, was first
discovered in 2001 and identified as immune checkpoints that
play a vital role in immunoregulation. These molecules are
normally expressed as type I surface glycoproteins containing
an amino-terminal immunoglobulin variable domain (V
domain) with five noncanonical cysteines, a mucin stalk, a
transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail. Among this
family, TIM-3, encoded by the HAVCR2 gene and its ligands, is
presently attracting increasing attention because of its potential
as a target for immunotherapy of different diseases, such as
cancers (9, 11, 12).
LIGANDS OF TIM-3
TIM-3 as a co-inhibitory molecule plays important and complex
roles in regulating immune responses and in inducing immune
tolerance (7, 13). The extracellular part of TIM-3 includes a
mucin domain and an IgV domain, which have glycosylated
sites and bind to ligands of TIM-3 (12, 14, 15). Emerging
evidence has shown that TIM-3 has several ligands,
including C-type lectin galectin-9 (Gal-9), phosphatidylserine
(PtdSer), carcinoembryonic antigen cell adhesion molecule 1
(CEACAM1), and high-mobility group protein 1 (HMGB-1)
(Figure 1). Gal-9 was identified as the first TIM-3 ligand that is
highly expressed in immune system tissues, such as lymph nodes,
bone marrow, thymus, and spleen, and can also be secreted by
tumor cells, endothelial cells, and other cells and interacts with
oligosaccharides on the TIM-3 IgV domain (7, 14, 16). The TIM￾3–Gal-9 interaction plays significant roles in the consequences of
infection, inflammation, peripheral tolerance, tumor immunity,
and autoimmunity, and evidence shows that this interaction
suppresses the response of immune cells (14, 17). Also, TIM-3
signaling induced by Gal-9 ligation causes exhaustion and
apoptosis of antigen-specific Th1 cells and CTLs through the
calcium-calpain-caspase-1 pathway, which correlates with the
impaired antitumor immune response (7, 13, 18). Collectively,
data show that the TIM-3–Gal-9 interaction can act via different
mechanisms and on different cell types to suppress
immune responses.
The TIM-3 expressed on monocytes, macrophages, and DCs
acts as a phagocytic receptor for apoptotic cells and enhances the
phagocytosis of apoptotic cells via interaction with PtdSer,

thereby boosting antigen cross-presentation (Figure 1A) (19).
The biological relationship between the TIM-3 and PtdSer in T
cells is unknown as T cells do not have a role in removing
apoptotic bodies, but it seems that the interaction of TIM-3 with
PtdSer can be effective in the production of IL-10 by T cells
because IL-10 has been demonstrated to be expressed by TIM-3+
T cells (Figure 1B) (20). The HMGB1 as a damage-associated
molecular pattern (DAMP) that binds to DNA released from
dying cells boosts nucleic acid sensing by toll-like receptors
(TLRs), but during chronic infection and cancers, due to
HMGB1 binding to TIM-3 expressed on APCs, it seems that
this interaction suppresses innate immune responses to the
nucleic acid (Figure 1A) (13, 21). CEACAM1 is another newly
identified ligand for TIM-3 that is co-expressed with TIM-3 in T
cells and also is expressed by DCs and other APCs (Figure 1B).
Therefore, the TIM-3 and CEACAM1 form an axis that can
inhibit immune responses either in cis or trans T cells and
myeloid cells, thereby downregulating their antitumor
immunity. The stability of mature TIM-3 on the cell surface is
promoted via cis interaction, and both cis and trans interactions
mediate the inhibitory function of TIM-3 (16, 22).
SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION EVENTS
OF TIM-3
In contrast to other co-stimulatory and co-inhibitory molecules
on immune cells, TIM-3 does not have a classical
immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition (ITIM) or
immunoreceptor tyrosine-based switch (ITSM) motif in its
cytoplasmic tail; however, it contains five tyrosine residues that
are conserved between humans and mice. In humans,
phosphorylation of two of the tyrosine residues, Y265 and
Y272 (Y256 and Y263 in mice), has been shown to be critically
important for triggering downstream signaling pathways. Van de
Weyer et al. demonstrated that Y265 of human TIM-3 is
specifically phosphorylated by the enzyme interleukin
inducible T cell kinase (ITK) from the TEC family of kinases
when TIM-3 has an interaction with Gal-9 (23). Another study
using the Jurkat, D10, and HEK293T cell lines, has shown that
the Src family of kinases, Fyn and Lck, can phosphorylate a TIM￾3 cytoplasmic portion (15, 24). Intriguingly, evidence suggests
that TIM-3 may act as a constitutive positive regulator of T cell
function and enhance signaling pathways that lead to T cell
activation, at least under conditions of acute stimulation. J. Lee
et al. reported that the recruitment of SH2 domain-containing
proteins, including the p85 of PI3K and PLC-g1 to the
phosphorylated tail of TIM-3 in the Jurkat T cell line
stimulated by TCR/CD3 and CD28, enhances the secretion of
IL-2 and the induction of transcription factors important for T￾cell activation, i.e., NFAT, AP-1, and NF-kB via interaction of the
components of the TCR signaling pathway, such as Zap-70 and
SLP-76 (24). Also, it has been reported that TIM-3 expression
has been associated with the generation of short-lived effector
CD8+ T cells in an mTOR-dependent manner, which was
considered a sign of co-stimulation by TIM-3 (16, 25). These
observations led to the ongoing debate of whether TIM-3 is a co￾stimulatory or co-inhibitory receptor. The results in the
following demonstrate that the pro-inflammatory profile of T
cells expressing ectopic TIM-3 was abrogated in the presence of
an agonistic TIM-3 antibody (24). It seems that any co￾stimulatory function of TIM-3 could be reversed in the
presence of its ligand(s) (25). Finally, studies have illustrated
that, when TIM-3 is not bound by a ligand, the HLA-B associated
A BC
FIGURE 1 | TIM-3, its ligands, and signal transduction events. Gal-9, PtdSer, CEACAM1, and HMGB-1 are the most important ligands for TIM-3. HMGB1 can bind
to TIM-3 expressed on APCs and suppress innate immune responses. PtdSer and TIM-3 interaction leads to an increase in the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells (A).
Binding of TIM-3 to Gal-9 and other TIM-3 ligands leads to phosphorylation of Y256 and Y263 by the tyrosine kinase ITK or Fyn and release of Bat3 from the TIM-3
tail, which promotes TIM-3-mediated T cell inhibition (B). When TIM-3 is not bound by a ligand, Bat3 links to the C-terminal tail of TIM-3 (the Tyr 256 and Tyr 263 in
the C-terminal tail) and blocks SH2 domain-binding sites in its tail and recruits the active catalytic form of LCK that promotes T cell signaling (C). Bat3, HLA-B

transcript 3 (Bat3) links to the C-terminal tail of TIM-3, blocks
SH2 domain-binding sites in its tail, recruits the active catalytic
form of LCK that promotes T cell signaling, and represses TIM￾3-mediated cell death and exhaustion (Figure 1C). On the other
hand, Gal-9 and CEACAM-1 binding to TIM-3 leads to
phosphorylation of Y256 and Y263 by the tyrosine kinase ITK
or Fyn and release of Bat3 from the TIM-3 tail. This, in turn,
promotes TIM-3-mediated T cell inhibition by facilitating the
binding of Src kinases and subsequent regulation of TCR
signaling (Figure 1B) (8, 15, 20, 26). Fyn can potentially
contribute to TIM-3-mediated inhibitory signaling as it is
known to bind to the same domain in the cytoplasmic tail of
TIM-3 as Bat3, indicating potential competition between Fyn
and Bat3 for TIM-3 binding, a likely molecular switch between
TIM-3/Bat3, and TIM-3/Fyn might change the TIM-3 function
from being permissive to TCR signaling to suppression of TCR
signaling. TIM-3 can also bind to receptor phosphatases CD45
and CD148 and interrupt immunological synapses, which has
been suggested as an additional mechanism of T cell inhibition
(16). It can be concluded that TIM-3 acts like a checkpoint
inhibitor when it is bound to its ligands. Based on the
abovementioned studies, TIM-3 transduces co-stimulatory
signals when it is not bound to its ligands. For immunotherapy
of cancers, we suggest that using an antagonist of TIM-3 ligands
may have more beneficial effects than blocking TIM-3. It is an
idea that should be studied in the future.
THE EFFECT OF TIM-3 ON ADAPTIVE AND
INNATE IMMUNE CELLS
It has been shown that the expressed TIM-3 on immune cells can
regulate both innate and adaptive immune responses via either
positive or negative effects depending on the cells expressing
this receptor, its connection to its ligands, and also its
microenvironment (27). TIM-3 was initially identified as a T
cell marker for Th1 and CD8+ T cells in the EAE model (28), and
it was later shown that TIM-3 is expressed by human Th1 and
Th17 cells (29) and also other cells including DCs, macrophages,
microglial cells, mast cells, and NK cells.
THE EFFECT OF TIM-3 ON ADAPTIVE
IMMUNE CELLS
Signaling via TIM-3 after binding to the ligand plays a key role in
the regulation of immune responses via negatively regulating
Th1 cell viability and secretion of cytokines, such as TNF and
IFN-g, and this, in turn, leads to immune tolerance (20, 30). It
has been reported that TIM-3 also has a role in regulating Th17
cells and suppresses their activation and cytokine secretion (9,
20). However, altered TIM-3 expression was reported to occur in
various human diseases. For instance, TIM-3 has been
recognized as a negative regulator of antitumor immunity. The
expression of TIM-3 on both CD4+ and CD8+ TILs could induce
T cell exhaustion and promote the expansion of the
immunosuppressive cell population (12). Recent studies have
shown that TIM-3 expressed on T cells and cancer stem cells also
suppresses immune responses through inducing the
development of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) that
are a heterogeneous CD11b+
Gr-1+ myeloid cell population.
Blocking of TIM-3 has been shown to reduce the number of
MDSCs; increase the production of IL-6, IFN-g, and TNF-a; and
restore effector functions of exhausted CD8+ T cells and their
antitumor activity (13, 19, 31). Furthermore, TIM-3 is expressed
on Foxp3+ Tregs, and the interaction of Gal-9 with TIM-3+ in
these cells enhances the regulatory function of Tregs, such as the
robust expression of IL-10, perforin, granzyme A, granzyme G,
and CD39 (9, 18, 20). On the other hand, Gal-9 expression on
Tregs suppresses TIM-3+ effector T cell function, so TIM-3 has
been identified as a marker of Tregs in tumors (16, 25). Also,
with the expression of TIM-3 on Tfh cells, it was reported in the
tumor microenvironment that te TIM-3+ Tfh cells produce less
of the chemokine CXCL13 and cytokine IL-21 and have less
proliferating potential than TIM-3− Tfh cells (32). Accordingly,
blocking the TIM-3–Gal-9 pathway entails a palpable decrease in
the suppressive activity of Tregs in vitro (9). It has been
demonstrated in some tumors, including ovarian carcinoma,
that blockade of TIM-3 has reversed Treg-mediated immune
suppression (18).
Expression of TIM-3 on CD8+ T cells is closely associated
with other immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-1,
CD160, 2B4, and lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG3), and
their chronic persistence is associated with an exhaustion status.
In comparison with PD-1, single positive CD8+ T cells, TIM-3+
PD-1+ CD8+ T cells represent an “extremely” exhausted T cell
population that exhibits a lower secretion of IFN-g and the
expression of CD107a, and also the expression of MHC-I on
these lymphocytes decreased (9, 20, 33). Dolina et al. have
reported that TIM-3+ CD8+ T cells induced in the liver during
adenovirus infection exhibit suppressive “Treg” function. On
these suppressive CD8+ T cells, TIM-3 acts as a “sink” to uptake
HMGB1, preventing HMGB1 from activating hepatic CD8+ T
cells via TLRs (20, 34). Based on this, high levels of TIM-3
expression on CD8+ T cells have been reported to be associated
with a poor prognosis for tumor progression (18). Based on the
expression of TIM-3 in TME and its suppressive effect on
adaptive immune cells, it can be suggested that blocking PD-1,
which is used as an immunotherapy for a few cancers, may not
have a sufficient effect in contrast to blocking PD-1 and TIM-3
together (Table 1).
THE EFFECT OF TIM-3 ON INNATE
IMMUNE CELLS
As mentioned earlier, TIM-3 is also expressed on innate immune
cells, and after the attachment to its ligand, it regulates the
activation of these cells through a mechanism usually studied in
T cells. Of note, TIM-3 plays a much more complex role in
innate immunity than in adaptive immunity. Zhang et al. have
reported that, in autoimmune diseases, TIM-3 expression is
Ganjalikhani Hakemi et al. TIM-3 in Hepatocellular Carcinoma
Frontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org 4 December 2020 | Volume 10 | Article 601661

increased on macrophages. Moreover, it has been shown that
M2-like macrophages show higher levels of TIM-3 expression
than M1-like macrophages, and this increased expression of
TIM-3 on M2 macrophages participates in immune regulation
by suppressing macrophage activation (18, 20). In humans,
constitutive expression of TIM-3 on monocyte/macrophages
inhibits IL-12 secretion. Although studies about how TIM-3
affects monocytes and macrophages are infrequent, it is known
that some mechanisms can be regulated by TIM-3 in these cells
in different pathologic conditions, such as infections,
autoimmunity, and cancers (15). There appears to be a close
connection between TIM-3 expression and the modulation of
TLR activation in myeloid cells. Monocytes/macrophages have a
high expression of TIM-3 with low cytokine production in a
quiescent state, but when these cells are stimulated with TLR, the
TIM-3 expression is reduced, and subsequently, the IL-12
production is enhanced. In macrophages, Gal-9–TIM-3
interaction downregulates TLR signaling, leading to a decrease
in IL-12 and IL-1b production; an increase of IL-23, IL-6, IL-8,
and IL-10 production; and reducing phosphorylation of STAT-1
while enhancing activation of STAT-3, so TIM-3 is a negative
regulator of the TLR response (9, 15). According to studies, it
seems that TIM-3 can also have TLR-independent effects on
macrophages. Xingwei Jiang et al. have reported that TIM-3,
through residues Y256 and Y263, binds to STAT1 and inhibits
STAT1 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. This leads to
the inhibition of the STAT1-miR-155 signaling axis and
enhances the function of SOCS1 in macrophages. As a result,
this promotes M2 macrophage polarization (57). Furthermore,
studies have shown that TIM-3 is involved in M2 polarization in
both TGF-b-dependent and -independent manners and
promotes tumor growth through the NF-kB/IL-6 axis (20, 47,
58). TIM-3, except for inhibiting the activation of macrophages,
can contribute to the efferocytosis process, which refers to the
mechanism of eliminating the damaged cells and apoptotic
bodies that happen after binding PtdSer to TIM-3 (15, 20). As
the interaction of PtdSer with TIM-3 is the principal signal for
the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, blocking this interaction can
induce immunological abnormalities, such as generating
autoantibodies (15). Conclusively, TIM-3 can simultaneously
enforce and regulate multiple important functions in
macrophages, such as the endocytosis of apoptotic bodies and
activation in response to TLR stimuli and mechanisms
after activation.
The constitutive expression of TIM-3 is found on DCs and
may be positively correlated with DC activation. In vitro
experiments have shown that the stimulation of TIM-3 with
Gal-9 on DCs can result in the production of pro-inflammatory
cytokines, such as TNF-a and DC maturation. Additionally,
TIM-3 signaling activated by Gal-9 in tumor-bearing animal
models can increase the number of mature DCs and improve the
antitumor immune response. Nevertheless, some researchers
have reported opposing results, demonstrating that TIM-3 may
also be a negative regulator of DCs. For example, it has been seen
that TIM-3 negative bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs), in
comparison with TIM-3+ DCs, show an impaired function
phenotype and exhibit a much poorer capacity to express IFN￾b1, IFN-a, and IL-6 cytokines (9, 20). Also, in TME, TIM-3
expression is induced on resident DCs so TIM-3+ myeloid cells
may act as a molecular sink for HGMB1, which can also be
secreted by tumor cells (13, 21). When TIM-3 binds to HMGB1,
the transport of nucleic acids into endosomes is blocked; thus,
the pattern-recognition receptor-mediated innate immune
responses against tumor-derived nucleic acids is suppressed
(55). Interestingly, tumor-infiltrating DCs in TME express a
higher amount of TIM-3 than DCs in normal tissues. Thus, TIM￾3 plays a role in tumor pathogenesis. These findings suggest that
TIM-3, which acts as a negative regulatory checkpoint, is

associated with both T cell exhaustion and inhibition of innate
immune responses (20). The regulatory effect of TIM-3 on DCs
is alternating, and other factors, such as different ligands of TIM￾3, can modulate the regulatory effect of TIM-3 on DCs.
Moreover, as mentioned, it seems that the microenvironment
has a key role in the function of TIM-3 expressed on the DC
surface. For example, the ratio between GAL-9 and HMGB1 in
the tumor microenvironment plays an important role in
determining whether TIM-3 expression on DCs can be
beneficial or detrimental to the tumor.
Recent data have shown that the highest TIM-3 expression
level in human PBMCs is on NK cells, particularly on all mature
CD56dimCD16+ NK cells. Also, cytokines such as IL-12, IL-15,
and IL-18 could induce TIM-3 upregulation on immature
CD56brightCD16− NK cells. Furthermore, interaction with Gal￾9–TIM-3 in NK cells improves NK cell–mediated cytotoxicity
and IFN-g production. Thus, TIM-3 can be considered as a
marker of full maturation and function in NK cells.
Paradoxically, in other reports, NK cell responses may be
downregulated if NK cells encounter target cells expressing
related ligands of TIM-3. For example, in advanced melanoma
patients, NK cells expressing high levels of TIM-3 are
functionally exhausted, and its upregulation on NK cells is
associated with poor prognosis (9, 12, 20). Also, Liu Yuan
et al. have shown that blockade of TIM-3–Gal-9 interaction
can induce enhanced cytotoxicity and upregulates IFN-g
production in both NK cells from patients with chronic
hepatitis B and NK92 cell lines. These observations strongly
suggest that, although TIM-3 can be considered as a marker of
NK cell activation, its overexpression may also disrupt the
function of NK cells in certain situations (9, 20) (Table 1).
All in all, apart from the public attention that TIM-3 has
gained as an inhibitory immune regulator, its role in regulating
the host immune response is complicated and remains
controversial in many fields such as liver cancer.
TIM-3 AND HCC
The association of tumors and TIM-3 has been considered for
many years (9). The expression of TIM-3 has been found in
various types of cells in TME, including on TILs, cancer cells, and
endothelial cells (ECs). Upregulated expression of TIM-3 in
tumor tissue samples has been demonstrated in melanoma,
prostate cancer, colon cancer, bladder urothelial carcinoma,
cervical cancer, gastric cancer, liver cancer, and lung cancer
cells. In all of these cancers, a higher TIM-3 expression level is
correlated with poor prognosis (20, 30). Moreover, it was
reported that prolonged exposure to the PD-1-blocking
antibody upregulates the expression of TIM-3 in therapeutic
antibody-bound CD4 and CD8 T cells in the TME (59). On the
other hand, TIM-3 blockade in some cancers has been shown to
downregulate CTLA-4 and TIGIT expression levels and
significantly decrease the development of cancer (18). Given
the recent success of immune checkpoint therapy in cancer,
currently, TIM-3 has received increasing attention (9). However,
the exact role of TIM-3 in liver cancer is still unclear.
Several studies demonstrate that the expression of TIM-3 in
HCC cells is induced due to the presence of cytokines, such as IL￾4, TGF-b, and IL-6 in the TME (60). The expression of TIM-3 in
HCC cells is accelerated tumor growth via autosecretion of IL-6,
and this also increases the metastatic ability of HCC cells by
promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (Figure
2) (61).
On the other hand, TIM-3 expression is also induced on
immune cells due to chronic stimulation and the cytokine milieu
FIGURE 2 | TIM-3 expression in HCC. Signaling via TIM-3 after binding to a ligand regulates immune responses via negatively regulating Th1 cell viability and
secretion of cytokines, such as TNF and IFN-g, and this, in turn, leads to immune tolerance. Gal-9–TIM-3 interaction downregulates TLR signaling, leading to a
decrease in IL-12 and IL-1b production and increase of IL-4, IL-6, TGF-ß, and IL-10 production. Due to the presence of cytokines, such as IL-4, TGF-b, and IL-6 in
the TME, TIM-3 expression is induced in HCC cells, and this upregulation leads to tumor growth through autosecretion of IL-6 and enhancement in the metastatic
ability by promoting EMT. TIM-3–Gal-9 interaction can decrease cytotoxicity in NK cells. EMT, epithelial-mesenchymal transition; Gal-9, galectin-9; HCC,

in the TME (60). Wu et al. find that TIM-3 expression is
increased on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells during chronic hepatitis,
which leads to decreasing plasma IFN-g and T-bet mRNA levels
in these cells (Figure 2). Moreover, the TIM-3 expression level is
associated with the severity of the disease and is positively
correlated with alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate
aminotransferase (AST), the international normalized ratio
(INR), and total bilirubin (TB) (62). Also, accumulating
evidence supports the possibility of a regulatory role for TIM-3
on TILs, leading to immunosuppression in HCC TME.
Accordingly, Yan W et al. have detected increased TIM-3
expression levels on CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells from peripheral
blood of HCC patients (47). Moreover, Liu Y et al. demonstrate
that the expression of TIM-3 is elevated on CD4+ and CD8+ T
cells infiltrating tumor tissues in comparison with those cells
infiltrating the neighboring tissues (9, 47). Also, Jie Ji et al. have
reported that the expression of Lnc-TIM-3 was highly
upregulated in the TILs of HCC patients. This LncRNA binds
to the intracellular tail of TIM-3, so it suppresses the downstream
signaling pathway NFAT1 and AP-1 due to the release of Bat3
from the TIM-3 tail in CD8 T cells (63). Zhou G et al.
demonstrate that T cells expressing PD-1 and TIM-3 display
the lowest level of granzyme B, IFN-g, and TNF-a and, hence,
suggest that PD-1 and TIM-3 play a key role in T cell suppression
in the HCC microenvironment (64). In accordance, the
frequency of TIM-3 positive tumor-infiltrating T cells is
correlated with a poor prognosis, and TIM-3–Gal-9 signaling
promotes T cell senescence. In the HCC, Kupffer cells have the
highest level of Gal-9 expression due to their response to IFN-g
derived from TILs and are co-localized with TIM-3 positive T
cells (Figure 2). Blocking of the TIM-3–Gal-9 signaling pathway
reactivates T cell–mediated antitumor immunity as confirmed by
the enhanced proliferation of T cells and increased cytokine
production in the HCC microenvironment. Therefore, TIM-3
might be a great potential target in HCC therapy by stimulating
both innate and adaptive immune responses (9, 12, 47). The
results of these studies suggest that, in HCC, it is better to use
blocking antibodies against PD-1 and TIM-3 together for
significant results in the immunotherapy of HCC.
Recent studies have shown that, due to the presence of
enhanced TIM-3 on monocytes in chronic hepatitis B patients,
this molecule plays a key role in the pathogenesis of chronic
hepatitis B (65). According to these results, it is reported that the
TIM-3 expression on peripheral blood monocytes is higher in
patients with HCC compared to controls, and there is a negative
correlation between TIM-3 expression and a patient’s survival.
Wenjiang Yan et al. show that enhanced expression of TIM-3 on
tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in hepatocellular
carcinoma is triggered by tumor-derived signals, including
TGF-b (11, 20, 47). Interestingly, the expression of TIM-3 is
even higher in M2 monocytes, which are traditionally described
as inducers of tumor progression (9, 47, 58). A TIM-3
knockdown assay in LPS/IL-4-stimulated bone marrow-derived
monocytes (BMDMs) has shown that, in either TGF-b￾dependent or -independent pathways, TIM-3 can induce
polarization toward M2 macrophages. Recently, the important
role of NF-kB in maintaining the M2 phenotype and protumoral
function of TAMs has been emphasized in various cancers,
including HCC. Yan W et al. show that TIM-3 mediates the
activation of the NF-kB pathway in TGF-b or IL-4-stimulated
macrophages. In one study, blockade of TIM-3 expression on
macrophages led to the inhibition of HCC growth both in vitro
and in vivo, which is probably due to the reduced production of
IL-6 by macrophages (47). Also, it was reported that tumor￾infiltrated conventional NK (cNK) and liver resident NK (LrNK)
cells showed elevated TIM-3 expression in HCC patients (Figure
2), which, in turn, suppresses their cytokine secretion and
cytotoxicity because TIM-3 disrupts the downstream Akt/
mTORC1 signaling in NK cells (66). Indeed, TIM-3 is not only
expressed on immune cells, but is also expressed in HCC cells
and serves as an oncoprotein in these cells (9, 47). These novel
data propose that TIM-3 may have other functions in addition to
the inhibition of immune responses. All of these results further
emphasize the important role of TIM-3 as a new player in HCC
progression and a potential target in HCC immunotherapy.
CLINICAL STUDIES ON TIM-3 IN HCC
AND OTHER CANCERS
Different studies have shown that TIM-3 expression is correlated
with HCC outcome. Hang Li et al. showed that the higher
number of TIM-3+ TIL T cells in HCC tissue is correlated with
shorter survival of patients (67). Besides this, there are positive
correlations between TIM-3 expression on CD14+ monocytes
with tumor grade and TIM-3 expression on TAMs with poor
prognosis in HCC patients (47). It is also shown that TIM-3
expression in PBMCs may predict recurrence in therapeutic
liver-restricted HCC patients (68). Also, studies demonstrate
that polymorphism in the promoter region of the TIM-3 gene
can predispose HBV-related cirrhosis and HCC (69, 70) because
the level of TIM-3 expression, remarkably, is correlated with its
gene polymorphisms (71). Overall, an increase in TIM-3
expression in PBMCs, TAMs, and TIL T cells in HCC
indicates poor prognosis, more advanced tumor grades, shorter
survival, and a higher probability of recurrence. These findings
support that the use of antibodies against TIM-3 can restore
responses of HCC-derived T cells to tumor antigens and improve
overall survival and treatment response in HCC patients.
There are a few clinical trials about the use of antagonistic
anti-TIM-3 monoclonal antibodies in cancers, especially HCC,
that have been registered on ClinicalTrials.gov. MBG453 is an
anti-TIM-3 mAb for which the efficacy and safety have been
evaluated in first clinical trials as a single agent or in combination
with PDR001 (anti-PD-1 mAb) in advanced malignancy patients
(NCT02608268). It was also conducted in patients with acute
myelocytic leukemia or high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes
(NCT03066648) (72). TSR-022 is another anti-TIM-3 mAb for
which its efficacy and safety were assessed in patients with an
advanced solid tumor alone or in combination with TSR-042
(NCT02817633). There are also two other clinical trials on TSR￾022 (NCT03680508, NCT03307785) (73, 74). NCT03680508 is a

phase II trial that is studying the effect of TSR-022 in
combination with TSR-042 (anti-PD-1 antibody) in the
treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic liver
cancer, and it has begun recruitment. Sym023 is another anti￾TIM-3 mAb in phase I clinical trials in patients with metastatic
cancer, solid tumor, and lymphoma (NCT03489343). There are
other TIM-3 inhibitors in the phase I trial, such as BMS986258,
LY3321367, SHR1702, and INCAGN2390 (61, 75). RO7121661
is a bispecific antibody targeting TIM-3 and PD-1 and has been
used in patients with advanced and/or metastatic solid tumors in
a phase 1 study; results are awaited in May 2023 (NCT03708328)
(76). In a meta-analysis by Qin et al., a total of 3072 patients were
included, and their results suggested that TIM-3 protein
overexpression was relevant to poor overall survival. They also
showed that TIM-3 was connected with tumor grade, PD-1
expression, and lymph node metastasis. Finally, they concluded
that TIM-3 has the potential to be a prognostic marker and a
valuable therapeutic target in solid tumors (77).
METABOLIC SITUATION IN HCC AND THE
ROLE OF TIM-3
The metabolism, phenotype, and function of immune cells are
affected by the presence and level of the nutrition molecules in
the TME, such as fatty acids and glucose, which is the concept of
“immunometabolism.” Glucose deficiency and lactic acid
abundance in the TME limit the activity of CTLs, and
enhancement of fatty acid oxidation (FAO) blocks the
cytotoxicity of CTLs in tumors, whereas Treg cells use FAO
instead of glycolysis, so these cells survive in glucose-deficient
and hypoxic environments and suppress the tumor-killing
function of CTLs (1, 2, 5). Elevated aerobic glycolysis,
gluconeogenesis, and b-oxidation of fatty acids, along
with reduced TCA cycle activity, are major metabolic
alterations in liver cancer. Thus, similar to effector T cells,
liver cancer tumor cells predominantly use glycolysis even in
the presence of sufficient oxygen pressure. On the other hand,
lactate is released into the extracellular environment by
monocarboxylate carriers (MCT) as a result of increased
glycolysis activity, and accordingly, an overexpression of
MCT4 has been reported in HCC samples (78). A high rate of
lactic acid production by liver cancer cells through glycolysis is
another nonnegligible issue when considering the metabolic
reprogramming of liver cancer–associated immune cells.
Lactate can increase the number of MDSCs, thereby
influencing the other cell types and also inhibiting the function
of NK cells. The immunosuppressive functions of MDSC are also
regulated by other metabolites, such as fatty acids (78). In liver
cancer, an elevated b-oxidation fatty acid compensates energy
deficiency and also reduces tumor dependence on glucose (5).
However, deregulation of mitochondrial b-oxidation and many
enzymes involved in fatty acid oxidation in HCC tumor cells has
been reported (78, 79). Some convincing evidence shows that the
oxidative metabolism of MDSCs is increased by the
accumulation of lipids, which also, in turn, activates their
immunosuppressive mechanisms (78). M2 polarized
macrophages need oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and
FAO to obtain the required energy and exert their protumor
function in various conditions, such as liver cancer (5, 78).
Accordingly, patients with obesity, diabetes, and hepatic
steatosis demonstrate an increased risk of HCC pathogenesis
as the liver plays a key role in the metabolism of lipids and
lipoproteins (78, 80). PD-1 signaling switches T cell metabolism
from glycolysis to FAO by reducing AKT activation and, thus,
suppressing mTOR activity (81, 82). Also, PD-1 signals inhibit
the expression of key metabolic regulator peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator 1-alpha
(PGC1a), the overexpression of which in tumor antigen–
specific CD8+ T cells could enhance antitumor responses by
promoting mitochondrial biogenesis (83). However, the exact
mechanisms through which TIM-3 alters T cell metabolic
program remains to be elucidated. TIM-3–Gal9 interaction
targets the main metabolism-associated signaling pathways,
such as PI3K/Akt/mTOR, and is highly expressed on
dysfunctional or exhausted T cells in TILs in various types of
cancers. TIM-3–mediated effects may alter the metabolism of
effector T cells in a way similar to PD-1 (8).
Also, increasing evidence has shown that TIM-3 expressed on
tumor cells and tumor-associated immune cells have pleiotropic
functions that affect several immunologic and biologic aspects of
different types of cells (30). For example, in AML cell lines (HL￾60), it is shown that TIM-3, through moderate activation of the
mTOR, can activate HIF-1a, which upregulates glycolysis and
expression/secretion of the pro-angiogenic vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF) (15, 31, 84). Because TIM-3 is an
important immune checkpoint in HCC, knowing the
immunometabolism pathways that are affected by TIM-3 is an
interesting subject that should be studied in the future. These
studies may help us to discover better immunotherapy targets
in HCC.
CONCLUDING REMARKS
Increasing the percentage of patients who may respond to
anticancer therapies is one of the main challenges in
immunotherapy. An accumulating body of evidence confirms the
importance of TIM-3 as an immune checkpoint in various human
cancers, including HCC. Although its roles as an immune
checkpoint in immune and tumor cells have gained much
attention, the role of TIM-3 in metabolic reprogramming of
immune and cancer cells in the context of HCC has not yet been
thoroughly investigated. Based on the importance of HCC as a
severe problem in global health and also because of the paucity of
information about the role of TIM-3 as a metabolic checkpoint, the
investigation and determination of the expression pattern of TIM-3
and its ligands in the HCC TME are of importance. The expression
of TIM-3 and its ligands on cancer and immune cells have been
shown in HCC TME. Because interaction of TIM-3 to its ligands
makes an immunosuppressive situation in TME, blocking the TIM￾3 or its ligands can be a promising target for immunotherapy in

HCC. In addition, determining the role of TIM-3–Gal-9 interaction
versus TIM-3 inhibition on TIL, M2, MDSC, and tumor cell
metabolic reprogramming in order to define the crosstalk
between metabolic reprogramming of immune cells and cancer
cells in this malignancy is highly recommended.
