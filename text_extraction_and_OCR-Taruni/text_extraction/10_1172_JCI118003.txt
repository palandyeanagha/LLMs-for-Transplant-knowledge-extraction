Abstract
The development of arteriosclerotic lesions in the Lewis to
F344 rat model of chronic cardiac rejection is characterized
by macrophage adhesion to the vessel lumen and macro￾phage infiltration in the neointima prior to smooth muscle
cell accumulation. We report the cloning and characteriza￾tion of allograft inflammatory factor-i (AIF-1), a novel
cDNA that is expressed early and persistently in chronically
rejecting cardiac allografts but is absent in cardiac syngrafts
and host hearts. The full-length cDNA codes for a hydro￾philic polypeptide of 17 kD that contains a 12-amino acid
region similar to an EF-hand (calcium-binding) domain. In
cardiac allografts AIF-1 transcripts and protein localized
to infiltrating mononuclear cells. Analysis of isolated cell
populations confirmed that AIF-1 was selectively expressed
in macrophages and neutrophils and demonstrated that
AIF-1 transcripts could be upregulated by sixfold after stim￾ulation with the T cell-derived cytokine IFN-y. Treatment
with a diet deficient in essential fatty acids (which attenuates
arteriosclerosis) or CTLA-4 Ig (which blocks lymphocyte
activation) significantly decreased AIF-1 transcript levels.
Upregulation of AIF-1 in the setting of T cell activation
suggests that it may play a role in macrophage activation
and function. (J. Clin. Invest. 1995. 95:2954-2962.) Key

Introduction
The major manifestation of chronic cardiac rejection is trans￾plant arteriosclerosis (1-3). It is the leading cause of graft
failure and retransplantation after the first postoperative year.
Little is known about the pathogenesis of this diffuse, concentric
intimal thickening that affects a spectrum of vessels in trans￾planted hearts. Because arterial lesions typically occur in donor
vessels and are absent in recipient vessels, the development of
arteriosclerosis appears to reflect a localized immune-mediated
process. The most widely held hypothesis is that an alloimmune
response involving activated inflammatory cells and vascular
cells produces cytokines and growth factors that in turn mediate
smooth muscle-cell migration and proliferation.

Animal models of cardiac transplantation have provided a
way to evaluate the cellular and molecular components of trans￾plant arteriosclerosis (4, 5). Detailed immunocytochemical
analyses of specific inflammatory cell types that are present at
various times in the Lewis to F344 rat cardiac allograft model
point to a key role for the macrophage (6, 7). Arteriosclerotic
lesions in vessels from Lewis to F344 rat cardiac allografts
develop in stages. The earliest (7-14 d) involves the adhesion
of mononuclear cells to the vessel lumen. By day 30 an early
neointima forms that is composed predominantly of infiltrating
macrophages with some T lymphocytes. Between days 30 and
75 a actin-positive smooth muscle cells appear in the thickened
neointima interposed among the inflammatory cells. Neointimal
expansion is most striking after 100 d at which point it is often
obliterative, with a predominance of smooth muscle cells and
diminishing numbers of inflammatory cells.
Recent studies completed in our lab have examined the role
of macrophages in the pathogenesis of chronic rejection and
have demonstrated that macrophage activation occurs within
the transplanted heart in concert with increased expression of
inducible effectors such as monocyte chemoattractant protein￾1, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and galactose/N-acetylgalac￾tosamine macrophage lectin (8-10). Macrophage activation
and diversity are regulated in part by alterations in gene expres￾sion ( 11). Thus, one of our goals has been to study the macro￾phage directly in the transplanted heart as a way of preserving
the multiple cell types and stimuli that regulate its functional
state. One approach has involved using differential mRNA dis￾play to identify genes whose expression increases in cardiac
allografts undergoing chronic rejection in comparison with car￾diac syngrafts (12). These studies resulted in the identification
of a novel cDNA fragment that we termed allograft inflamma￾tory factor-I (ALF-1).' The purpose of the present study was
to isolate the full-length AIF-1 cDNA and characterize its ex￾pression in vivo during various stages of chronic rejection and
in vitro after cytokine stimulation. We demonstrate that the
T cell-derived cytokine IFN-y up-regulates ALF-1 expression,
suggesting a possible functional role for AIF-1 in macrophage
activation and function.
Methods
Lewis to F344 rat cardiac transplantation. The heterotopic abdominal
cardiac transplantation samples used in this study were originally pro￾cured in experimental sets described previously (9, 13, 14). For alloge￾neic combinations, F344 rats were used as recipients and Lewis rats
were used as donors. For syngeneic combinations Lewis rats served as
recipients and donors. At the time of harvest both the host (recipient)
heart, which served as a reference exposed to the same circulation, and

the transplanted heart were collected for histologic analysis and RNA
extraction.
Inflammatory cell populations. A lymphocyte-enriched cell popula￾tion was obtained by purifying isolated splenocytes on nylon wool (9).
Peritoneal inflammatory rat macrophages were elicited with thioglyco￾late medium or the bacille Calmette Guerin as described (9, 15). Rat
bone marrow-derived macrophages were obtained by growing femoral
bone marrow cells from Lewis rats in tissue culture medium containing
murine macrophage colony stimulating factor- 1 for 1 wk (9). More
than 95% of these cells stained positive for ED-l and were thus judged
to be of a monocyte/macrophage lineage. Culture medium was replaced
with medium not containing macrophage colony stimulating factor- 1 24
h before stimulation. Rat peritoneal neutrophils were obtained by casein
elicitation according to a protocol originally described for Guinea pigs,
except that 9% casein was used (16). Aortic smooth muscle cells de￾rived from Sprague-Dawley rats were the generous gift of Masao Yoshi￾zumi (Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, MA). Murine and
human cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collec￾tion (Rockville, MD).
Cloning. A 3' partial AIF-I cDNA fragment (382 bp) was identified
previously by differential mRNA display on the basis of increased ex￾pression in allogeneic hearts compared with syngeneic hearts ( 12). This
partial 3' cDNA fragment was then used to screen - 200,000 plaques
from a bacteriophage lambda, Uni-ZAP cDNA library prepared from
14-d cardiac allograft poly(A)+ RNA (Stratagene Inc., San Diego,
CA). Positive clones were isolated and rescued as plasmids, and their
identity was verified by demonstration of allograft-specific hybridization
on Northern blot analysis. DNA sequencing of both sense and anti￾sense strands was performed with the Sequenase 2.0 kit (United States
Biochemical, Cleveland, OH) on double-stranded plasmid DNA clones
and subclones. Nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequence searches
of the GenBank (release 84.0) and EMBL (release 36.0) databases
were performed with the GCG software package, and motif searches
were completed with the Prosite (release 92) data base. A hydrophilicity
profile was generated by using the MacVector software and the Kyte￾Doolittle algorithm.
Northern and genomic Southern analysis. Total RNA was isolated
with RNAzol B (Tel-Test, Friendswood, TX). Northern blots were
prepared with 20 ug of total RNA as described (12). Genomic DNA
was isolated and digested with the indicated restriction endonucleases,
electrophoresed through 0.8% agarose gels, and transferred to nitrocellu￾lose (Micron Separations, Westboro, MA) by capillary transfer as de￾scribed (17). Hybridization with cDNA probes labeled with 32P dCTP
by random priming (Boehringer-Mannheim Corp., Indianapolis, IN)
and high-stringency washes (0.2xSSC, 0.1% SDS at 60°C) were per￾formed as described (12).
Semiquantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR assay. To conserve
RNA, we used a modified reverse-transcriptase PCR technique to study
AJF-1 transcript levels instead of Northern blot analysis (9, 18). These
reverse-transcriptase PCR assays are sensitive, require only 2.5 /ig total
RNA, and permit replicates to be performed from a single cDNA prepa￾ration (18). cDNA synthesis was completed with random primers (2.5
/g of total RNA per reaction). Oligonucleotides were synthesized by
Genosys Biotechnologies, Inc. (The Woodlands, TX). To amplify rat
cDNAs we used the 5' primer GTCAATTCGCTATGAGCCAGA￾GCAAG and the 3' primer GAAGAAGCAGTTGTGAGCGTCGAC￾CAA, a combination that resulted in a 543-bp product. For murine and
human cDNAs we used an internal set of primers, 5' ATCCCAAGT￾ACAGCAGTGATGAGG and 3' GTCCCCCAGCCAAGAAAGCTA￾TTT, which generated a 329-bp PCR product. Reaction conditions were
as described (9). The thermal cycling parameters were denaturation at
94°C for 15 s, annealing at 56°C for 20 s, and extension for 60 s (with
a final extension of 7 min at the end of all cycles). For quantitative
PCR analyses, 150,000 cpm of 32P-dCTP were included in the PCR
reaction. The products were separated on 1% agarose gels, which were
dried and exposed to PhosphorImaging screens for 24 h, and the amount
of 32p incorporated in the amplified product bands was measured by
volume integration (Imagequant software; Molecular Dynamics, Sun￾nyvale, CA).
To identify the optimal PCR conditions for accurate measurement
of gene transcript levels, we established the linear assay ranges with
respect to cycle number and starting template concentration for various
dilutions of cDNA. Measurement of AIF-1 transcript levels was then
completed within these ranges (23 cycles and cDNA dilutions of 1.25
41 for both primer combinations). PCR analyses were completed on
each set of cDNA at least three times. PCR amplification with G3PDH,
a ubiquitously expressed gene, was used as a control to assess variations
in total RNA or cDNA loading between samples. Corrected AIF-1 values
were derived by dividing the measured amplified product value by the
mean of the G3PDH value obtained for that cDNA from at least three
analyses. Results were subjected to multivariate analysis of variance
without replication (10). If a difference was significant, individual com￾parisons were corrected by the Bonferroni method. Although there were
variations in absolute values derived from different experiments, relative
differences between cDNA sets analyzed at the same time were pre￾served.
In situ hybridization. In situ hybridization was completed as de￾scribed (19), using 5-psm frozen sections obtained from 28-d cardiac
allografts and paired host hearts and spleens. To generate radiolabeled
antisense and sense transcripts, we linearized the full-length AIF-1
cDNA and transcribed it with T7 or T3 polymerase in the presence of
35S-UTP. The specificity of the riboprobes was confirmed by Northern
analysis. The antisense probe hybridized to 0.7-kb transcripts in lanes
with cardiac allograft total RNA but not in lanes with day-0 heart total
RNA. The sense probe did not hybridize.
Protein expression studies. Recombinant ALF-1 was generated as a
fusion protein using the pMAL-c2 (New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly,
MA) or the pFLAG-l (International Biotechnologies, Inc., New Haven,
CT) expression vector according to the manufacturers' instructions. The
purified protein was used as an immunogen to generate a polyclonal
rabbit antiserum (East-Acres Biologicals, Southbridge, MA). Tissue or
cellular extracts were prepared by homogenization in 50 mM Tris (pH
8.0), 500 mM NaCl, 20% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, and 0.5 mM PMSF.
To determine whether ALF-1 was present in conditioned supernatant,
we concentrated the proteins in the supernatant by ultrafiltration (Micro￾con 10 ultraconcentrator; Amicon, Beverly, MA). Protein extracts (25
jtg) were separated on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to
polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA).
Immunostaining was performed with an enhanced chemoluminescence
detection kit (ECL; Amersham Corp., Cleveland, OH) according to the
manufacturer's directions, at primary antiserum dilutions of 1:3,000.
Negative controls included omission of the primary antibody or use of
preimmune serum. Immunohistochemical staining of frozen sections
from 28-d cardiac allografts, host hearts, and spleens was completed at
an antiserum dilution of 1:500 (1 h, 25°C) as described (9). Negative
controls included omission of the primary antiserum, use of preimmune
serum, and use of an irrelevant primary antiserum.
In vitro and in vivo regulation of AIF-J transcript levels. In vitro
stimulation studies of various macrophage cells or cell lines were com￾pleted using rat IFN-y (100 U/ml) (GIBCO BRL, Gaithersburg, MD),
phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate (50 ng/ml) (Sigma), or LPS (100 ng/
ml) (Escherichia coli serotype 011 1:B4; Sigma). To study whether
strategies that impair T cell activation in vivo would alter AIF-1 tran￾script levels, we evaluated cDNA samples from two series of transplants
performed previously. In the first series the cDNAs were prepared from
transplanted and host hearts harvested at day 7 and 28 from recipients
fed an anti-inflammatory, essential fatty acid-deficient (EFAD) diet or
a control diet (13). In the second transplant series the recombinant
fusion protein CTLA4 Ig (Bristol-Myers Squibb, Seattle, WA), which
blocks the CD28/B7 costimulatory pathway, was used to inhibit T cell
activation in chronic cardiac rejection (14). These cDNA samples were
prepared from 75-d cardiac allografts treated with (a) a single dose
of CTLA-4 Ig, which reduces mononuclear cell infiltration (0.5 mg
intraperitoneally, n = 3), (b) a single dose of CTLA-4 Ig (0.5 mg
intraperitoneally) combined with an intravenous injection of donor
splenocyte cells, which almost completely eliminates mononuclear cell
infiltration (n = 3), or (c) a single dose of cyclosporine A, which
is associated with significant mononuclear cell infiltration (5 mg/kg

cluster over regions of inflammatory cell infiltrates in cardiac
allograft sections, and they do not cluster over myocytes. Posi￾tive hybridization was predominately in the interstitium and

with ALF-1 mRNA were identified primarily in regions within
the red pulp (not shown). There was no significant hybridiza￾tion to host hearts (not shown) or when the sense probe was
used (Fig. 5 B). In sections from rat and mouse testis, silver

AIF-I transcript levels in inflammatory cell populations. To

Northern blotting (Fig. 6, A and B). AIF-1 transcripts were
expressed by bone marrow-derived macrophages, bacille Cal￾mette Guerin-elicited peritoneal macrophages, and casein-elic￾ited peritoneal neutrophils but not significantly by nylon wool￾purified lymphocytes, aortic smooth muscle cells, or bone mar￾row stem cells. In other studies (not shown), AIF-1 transcripts
were detected in thioglycolate-elicited peritoneal macrophages
and adherent splenocytes. By the reverse-transcriptase PCR
assay, AIF-1 transcripts were also present at low levels in a
variety of unstimulated murine and human myeloid cell lines

including J774A.1, RAW264.7, P388D.1, HL60, U937, and
THP-1. Transcripts were not detected in lymphocytic leukemia
cell lines (Jurkat or MOLT-4). Thus, AIF-1 appears to be ex￾pressed predominately by cells of the myeloid lineage (mono￾cytes/macrophages and neutrophils).
Immunoblotting with anti-AIF-I serum. A single band of
17 kD was detected with polyclonal rabbit anti-AIF-1 serum
in extracts from cardiac allografts, splenic tissue, and bone mar￾row-derived macrophages propagated in vitro (Fig. 7). How￾ever, AIF-1 was not detected in extracts from the conditioned
supernatant of resting or IFN-y-stimulated bone marrow-de￾rived macrophages or J774A.1 cells (not shown), demonstra￾ting that it is not released into the media. The presence of AIF￾1 protein in cardiac allografts and its absence in host hearts,
lymphocytes, and bone marrow cells (by immunoblotting) re￾produced the patterns shown for gene transcripts.
Immunohistochemical localization ofAIF-J antigen in car￾diac allografts. Immunostaining identified a subset of positively
labeled mononuclear cells within cardiac allografts (Fig. 8 A).
The positive cells showed a cytoplasmic staining pattern and
were found in regions of perivascular and interstitial infiltration.
Besides these inflammatory mononuclear cells, none of the pa￾renchymal cell types within the cardiac allograft stained posi￾tive. In splenic tissue scattered positive cells were identified
predominately in the red pulp (Fig. 8 B). There was also a rim
of positive cells just adjacent to the white pulp. In testis the
AIF-1 antigen localized predominately to germ cells and occa￾sionally to monocyte/macrophages (not shown), suggesting
that it may play a distinct role in this tissue-perhaps in germ
cell differentiation. In all cases, no significant staining was seen
when the primary antibody was omitted or when preimmune
serum was used.
In vitro upregulation ofAIF-J transcripts in IFN-y-treated
macrophages. We have recently shown that the expression of
the T cell-derived cytokine IFN-y is persistently upregulated in
chronically rejecting cardiac allografts (14). To examine

whether IFN-y is involved in the regulation of AIF-1 expres￾sion, we performed in vitro stimulation studies with various
rodent macrophage-like cell lines or isolated macrophage popu￾lations. In these studies IFN-y stimulation increased AIF-1
mRNA expression in mouse J774A. 1, RAW264.7, and P388D. 1
cell lines, as well as in rat bone marrow-derived macrophages.
The basal level of AIF-1 expression varied among the cell popu￾lations, as did the peak expression level in response to IFN-y
stimulation (three- to sixfold). In a representative study of
J774A.1 cells (Fig. 9 A), AIF-1 transcript levels increased sig￾nificantly (fivefold) 24 h after stimulation with IFN-y in com￾parison with cells stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate-13-ace￾tate or LPS (P < 0.0001). In contrast, the addition of LPS
antagonized IFN-y-induced expression of AIF-1, as has been
reported for other macrophage factors (24, 25 ). AIF-1 transcript
levels did not change significantly at 4 and 10 h with any of
the stimulants studied. A more detailed time-course study of
the IFN-y response showed that the increase in AIF-1 tran￾scripts was delayed, peaking in J774A.1 cells at 36 h after
stimulation (Fig. 9 B). The most effective dose of IFN-y was
100 U/ml of medium (Fig. 9 C). Immunoblotting confirmed
these time- and dose-dependent increases in AIF-1 expression
(data not shown). This late increase in AIF-1 expression sug￾gests that its up-regulation by IFN-y may be an indirect effect.
In vivo modulation of T cell activation reduces AIF-J tran￾scripts in cardiac allografts. To study the regulation of AIF-1
expression in vivo we applied strategies that attenuate T cell
activation and reduce IEN-y expression. Modulation of the in￾flammatory response with an EFAD diet decreases expression
of IFN-y at day 28, reduces mononuclear cell infiltration, and
attenuates arteriosclerotic development in Lewis to F344 cardiac
allografts (13). Here we show that ALF-1 transcript levels in
28-d cardiac allografts on the EFAD diet were reduced signifi￾cantly in comparison with those in allografts from recipients
fed a control diet (P < 0.0001) (Fig. 10 A). In contrast, at day
7 (before the EFAD diet has its effect), there was no significant
difference in AIF-1 transcript levels in allografts on the EFAD
diet versus the control diet. AIF-1 transcript levels in host hearts
were uniformly low.

cells (left panels) are visible in the interstitium of a 14-d cardiac allograft (A x940) and in the splenic red pulp (B x80 and C x940). No staining

Preliminary studies from our laboratory indicate that
blocking the CD28/B7 costimulatory pathway of T cell activa￾tion with CTLA-4 Ig prolongs allograft survival, reduces mono￾nuclear cell infiltration, and prevents T cell and macrophage
activation in the Lewis to F344 rat model ( 14). AIF-1 transcript
levels were reduced significantly in cardiac allografts from re￾cipients treated with CTLA-4 Ig in comparison with untreated
allografts or cyclosporine A-treated (single dose on day 2) allo￾grafts (P < 0.0001) (Fig. 10 B). The most dramatic decrease
was seen in the group that received CTLA-4 Ig in addition to
donor cells on the day of engraftment. AIF-1 transcript levels
in this group were significantly lower than those in cardiac
allografts that received CTLA-4 Ig alone (P < 0.0001) and
similar to those seen in control syngrafts. The decrease in AIF￾1 expression in cardiac allografts treated with the EFAD diet
and with CTLA-4 Ig corresponded to a reduction in the number
of ED-l -positive macrophages. Thus, in cardiac allografts
treated with CTLA-4 Ig there was a decrease in AIF-1 tran￾scripts that reflected the decrease in macrophage density. How￾ever, a direct or indirect effect of CTLA-4 Ig on AIF-1 expres￾sion may also contribute.
Discussion
Here we report the cloning of AIF-1 cDNA and the characteriza￾tion of its expression in vivo and in vitro. The 3' portion of the
AIF-l cDNA was originally identified in a screen for differen￾tially expressed genes present in cardiac allografts compared
with reference syngrafts (12). The strategy was to analyze
cDNAs from the cardiac allografts directly, as a way of preserv￾ing the infiltrating macrophages and the allogeneic microenvi￾ronment that regulated their functional state. Our further charac￾terization of AIF-1 has demonstrated that it is a novel factor
selectively expressed by inflammatory cells of the monocyte/
neutrophil lineage and up-regulated by IFN-y, although not
necessarily specific for allogeneic inflammation. The high levels
of AIF-1 in allografts reflected in part the high density of infil￾Cloning and Characterization of Allograft Inflammatory Factor-i 2959

HLA class Im region because it aligns with genomic sequences
in a 90-kb segment that had been sequenced in- a systematic
mapping effort (20). However, no coding sequences have been
reported to date in the homologous region. The presence of an
EF hand-like motif within the AIF-1 amino acid sequence is
intriguing. Two or more EF-hand domains are typical of the
family of intracellular calcium-binding proteins that includes
calmodulin and troponin C (26). However, AIF-1 deviates from
this family because it contains only a single EF-hand and, in
spite of the overall conservation in the EF-hand domain, it lacks
a conserved amino acid residue required for Ca binding. Thus,
the relation of AIF-1 to the EF-hand family remains to be estab￾lished.
Analysis of AIF-1 gene transcript and product expression
confirmed and extended our original finding that it is present
in rat cardiac allografts undergoing chronic rejection but absent

in syngrafts and paired host hearts (exposed to the same circula￾tion but with normal vessels) (12). More extensive studies
completed with a series of cardiac transplants harvested at vari￾ous time points showed that AIF-l transcripts increased signifi￾cantly in allografts by day 7 and remained elevated through
days 28 and 75. In contrast, AIF-1 levels were low in paired
host hearts. This early and sustained expression of ALF-1 is
consistent with an ongoing allogeneic inflammatory stimulation,
as might be expected in chronic rejection.
In cellular localization studies performed with cardiac allo￾graft and splenic tissue sections, AIF-1 localized to mononu￾clear cells and was found predominantly in regions occupied
by macrophages. In cardiac allografts, ED-i -positive macro￾phages have been shown to be the predominant infiltrating cell
type in the interstitium and perivascular space (7). Hence, the
AIF-l -positive cells described here are most likely macro￾phages. In the spleen AIF-1 staining was found in the red pulp
within a subset of cells with macrophage features, and in cells
forming a rim in the white pulp typical of marginal macrophages
(27). In contrast, in the testis there was a very high level of
expression of AIF-1 mRNA and antigen by differentiating germ
cells (data not shown), suggesting that AIF-l has a distinct
role in spermatogenesis as opposed to inflammation. In vitro
studies of isolated cells and cell lines from rats, mice, and
humans also confirmed the selective expression of AIF-1 by
cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage, in comparison with
cells of the lymphoid lineage. AIF-l was also expressed by
elicited neutrophils, a cell type seen infrequently in cardiac
allografts and spleen.
Myeloid specificity is a feature shared by other members of
the EF-hand family. The best studied examples are MRP8/
MRP14, which have been associated with a number of acute
and chronic inflammatory diseases (28), and murine CP-10, a
chemotactic protein for neutrophils and monocytes (29). Like
AIF-1, these proteins lack classic signal sequences. This lack
raises questions about whether they attain extracellular bioactiv￾ity at cell death or through alternative transport mechanisms.
Studies in vitro and in vivo have shown that the hinge region
between the two EF-hands of CP-10 contributes significantly
to its chemotactic activity (30). Further studies will be needed
to determine whether AIF-1 functions in the recruitment of cells
to sites of injury.
We also studied the regulation of AIF-1 expression in vitro
and in vivo. We have shown that a number of inflammatory
mediators associated with T cell activation (IFN-y) and macro￾phage activation (monocyte chemoattractant protein-i and in￾ducible nitric oxide synthase) are up-regulated in Lewis to F344
rat cardiac allografts undergoing chronic rejection (8, 10, 18).
IFN-y, a cytokine secreted by activated T lymphocytes and
natural killer cells, is a potent activator of macrophages and
affects a variety of macrophage properties and functions (31).
In this report we demonstrate in vitro that IFN-y up-regulates
expression of AIF-1 in various macrophage populations (up to
sixfold). The delayed increase in AIF-1 expression-it occurs
24 to 36 h after stimulation-suggests that the up-regulation is
an indirect effect that could involve intermediate steps. Interest￾ingly, we found that LPS antagonized the induction of ALF-1
in macrophages by IFN-y, as has been reported for MHC class
II and iNOS expression in macrophages (24, 25). We did ob￾serve that these same cells increased iNOS expression and ni￾trate production synergistically in response to the combination
of LPS and IFN-y (data not shown), indicating that the cells
can be responsive to LPS. This suggests that ALF-I transcription
might be suppressed (directly or indirectly) by LPS through
another pathway that may involve a different route of signal
transduction. Nonetheless, given the high expression of IFN-y
in the interstitium and vessels of Lewis to F344 rat cardiac
allografts undergoing chronic rejection (18), one can speculate
that the increase in AIF-1 expression may stem in part from
local up-regulation by IFN-y within the graft.
It has been shown that the expression of IFN-y in Lewis to
F344 cardiac allografts is down-regulated by treatment with an
EFAD diet or by blockade of T cell activation with CTLA-4
Ig ( 13, 14). We examined whether these two different strategies
would affect the levels of AIF-1 transcripts in vivo. The anti￾inflammatory effect of the EFAD diet results from defects in
arachidonate metabolism and leukotriene production (which im￾pair leukocyte chemotaxis and function) in rodent models of
inflammation that include glomerulonephritis (32). In Lewis to
F344 rat cardiac allografts the EFAD diet reduces mononuclear
cell infiltration, the severity of intimal thickening, and the num￾ber of vessels with intimal thickening that develop at early (day
28) as well as late (day 120) stages ( 13, 33). In this report we
show that there was a significant reduction in the number of
AIF-1 transcripts in day 28 cardiac allografts treated with the
EFAD diet in comparison with day 28 allografts on a control
diet. This reduction in AIF-I transcripts could be due to attenua￾tion of leukocyte infiltration or to leukocyte activation and pro￾duction of cytokines such as IFN-y, or both.
CTLA-4 Ig is a recombinant fusion protein that inhibits
the CD28/B7 costimulatory pathway required for activation of
lymphocytes (34). CTLA-4 Ig has been shown to prolong graft
survival in rat and mouse acute rejection models (35, 36), but
little is known about its effect on macrophages. We show here
that cardiac allografts treated with CTLA-4 Ig had lower AIF￾1 transcript levels (correlating with a reduction in mononuclear
cell infiltration) than transplants receiving the control treatment
(a single dose of cyclosporine A) and untreated animals. The
perioperative administration of donor cells in addition to CTLA￾4 Ig was associated with minimal mononuclear cell infiltration,
and it resulted in a further decrease in AIF-1 transcripts, to
levels similar to those seen in syngrafts. The effect of CTLA￾4 Ig alone may be incomplete, that is, it may only delay inhibi￾tion of T cell activation and require repeated administration.
However, with the increased availability of alloantigen supplied
by donor cells it may be possible to produce a long-lasting
tolerance due to clonal deletion of the alloantigen-specific T
cell population. Our observation that expression of AIF-1 was
attenuated by CTLA-4 Ig treatment in Lewis to F344 rat allo￾grafts suggests that T cell activation regulates this macrophage
component of the alloimmune response associated with chronic
cardiac rejection.
The identification of the novel myeloid factor AIF-1 in the
cytokine-rich milieu of cardiac allografts links it to the alloim￾mune response associated with chronic rejection and highlights
the prominence of macrophages in this process. From a practical
standpoint, measurement of AIF-I transcript or expression lev￾els may be useful in evaluating macrophage infiltration, and it
may serve as a clinical marker of chronic cardiac rejection.
Our in vitro studies provide evidence that AIF-I is a cytokine￾responsive molecule that can be upregulated by IFN-y, a prod￾uct of activated T cells. The in vivo studies demonstrate that
AIF-1 transcript levels decrease in accord with monocyte infil￾tration when IFN-y expression is attenuated in cardiac allografts
treated with CTLA-4 Ig or the EFAD diet. This modulation of
AIF-I expression may be an indirect result of alterations in
Cloning and Characterization of Allograft Inflammatory Factor-i 2961

expression of cytokines or chemokines such as IFN-y within
the graft. Alternatively, these treatments may have direct effects
on AIF-1 transcription. The next step will be to determine
whether the effect of these treatments is due to alterations in
the degree of macrophage infiltration or impaired macrophage
activation. Additional strategies for inhibiting various compo￾nents of T cell activation in vivo will be helpful in determining
the specific factors that regulate AIF-1 expression and, ulti￾mately, its functional role in macrophage biology.
