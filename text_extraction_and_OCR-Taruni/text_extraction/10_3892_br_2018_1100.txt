Abstract. In the present meta‑analysis, the efficacy and 
safety of orlistat in the treatment of non‑alcoholic fatty liver 
(NAFLD) and non‑alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) were 
evaluated. PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Web of 
Science, and Wan Fang data were searched for controlled 
trials of orlistat in patients with NAFLD or NASH, published 
before August 2017. Three randomized controlled trials and 
four single‑arm trials were included. The involved participants 
with NAFLD or NASH (330 patients) were analyzed for 
clinical outcomes including alteration in hepatic histological 
variables and biomarkers of liver function. Improvements 
were observed in levels of alanine aminotransferase [standard 
mean difference (SMD)=‑1.41; P=0.01], aspartate aminotrans￾ferase (SMD=‑2.06; P=0.0005), γ‑glutamyl transpeptidase 
(SMD=‑1.91; P=0.05), glucose [mean difference (MD)=‑0.51; 
P=0.01], triglycerides (MD=‑0.93; P=0.01), homeostasis 
model assessment of insulin resistance index (MD=‑1.05; 
P=0.04) and body mass index (MD=‑1.97; P=0.02), but not 
in liver fibrosis score (SMD=‑0.14; P=0.71). On sub‑analyses 
of the different patient groups, no significant differences were 
observed in patients with NASH. Taken together, these find￾ings demonstrate that orlistat could serve as a therapeutic drug 
to improve biochemical indicators of liver damage, but not as 
first‑choice drug for the management of NAFLD or NASH; 
thus suggesting a novel palliative drug only for the treatment 
of NAFLD.
Introduction
Non‑alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a chronic liver 
disease characterized by hepatic fat accumulation in patients 
with little to no history of alcohol consumption (1). Up to 30% of 
the worldwide population is affected by NAFLD, among which 
populations in developed countries are particularly affected, 
including those in the United States (2,3). The occurrence 
and development of NAFLD are associated with metabolic 
syndrome, which comprises a group of disorders including 
obesity, increased plasma triglycerides (TGs) and reduced 
insulin sensitivity (4). More specifically, Li et al (5) reported 
that obesity may be an independent risk factor for NAFLD. 
NAFLD is considered a public health concern due to its 
potential to progress to non‑alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), 
fibrosis, cirrhosis and even hepatocellular carcinoma (6,7). 
The primary therapy for NAFLD is lifestyle management to 
prevent obesity; however, long‑term changes in eating habits 
and weight loss are difficult to achieve and maintain (8). Due 
to the lack of effective therapy options and consequences of 
disease progression, the development of novel pharmacological 
treatments for NAFLD should be actively pursued.
Orlistat is among the few types of over‑the‑counter diet pill 
available worldwide, and is a potent and long‑lasting gastrointes￾tinal lipase inhibitor that directly blocks intestinal absorption of 
dietary fat, and thus promotes weight loss(9,10). In clinical trials, 
patients treated with orlistat exhibited lower fasting glucose, 
fasting insulin, TGs, insulin resistance as assessed via the 
homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA‑IR) 
and body mass index (BMI), along with greater weight loss 
compared with those treated with placebo (11‑13). Furthermore, 
orlistat was demonstrated to reduce transaminase levels (14), 
commonly used as biomarkers to assess liver damage (14,15). 
As an inhibitor of gastroenteric lipase, the long‑term applica￾tion of orlistat is considered to have no toxic side effects (16); 
additionally, any adverse effects in the contexts of cardiovascular 
outcome and carcinogenesis are as yet unreported.
For these reasons, orlistat is expected to be an effective drug 
for the management of NAFLD; however, its efficacy remains 
controversial. Zelber‑Sagi et al (17) identified that, compared

with placebo, orlistat did not cause a significant reduction in 
body weight in patients with NAFLD. Thus, the purpose of the 
present systematic review and meta‑analysis was to evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of orlistat in patients with NAFLD or NASH.
Materials and methods
Protocol. The meta‑analysis was conducted by two investiga￾tors independently. Any differences in opinion were resolved 
by consensual agreement. The methods used adhered to 
the criteria of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic 
Reviews and Meta‑Analyses guidelines (18).
Literature search strategy. In August 2017, a computer‑assisted 
search was performed of PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/pubmed), Embase (https://www.embase.com/#search), 
Cochrane Library (https://onlinelibrary‑wiley‑com.webproxy.
potsdam.edu/cochranelibrary/search), Web of Science (http://
isiknowledge.com) and Wan Fang data (http://www.wanfangdata.
com.cn/index.html) using the following combinations of terms: 
‘THLP’ or ‘tetrahydrolipastatin’ or ‘Xenical’ or ‘Roche brand 
of orlistat’ or ‘Hoffmann‑La Roche brand of orlistat’ or ‘Alli’ 
or ‘GlaxoSmithKline brand of orlistat’ and ‘non‑alcoholic fatty 
liver disease’ or ‘NAFLD’ or ‘nonalcoholic fatty liver disease’ or 
‘fatty liver, nonalcoholic’ or ‘fatty livers, nonalcoholic’ or ‘liver, 
nonalcoholic fatty’ or ‘livers, nonalcoholic fatty’ or ‘nonalcoholic 
fatty liver’ or ‘nonalcoholic fatty livers’ or ‘nonalcoholic steato￾hepatitis’ or ‘nonalcoholic steatohepatitides’ or ‘steatohepatitides, 
nonalcoholic’ or ‘steatohepatitis, nonalcoholic’.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria. Database search results were 
screened using the following inclusion criteria: i) NAFLD or 
NASH diagnosed using results of liver biopsy or imaging; 
ii) orlistat prescribed to patients with NAFLD or NASH; iii) if 
present, controls were placebo, energy‑controlled diet and/or 
vitamin E; and iv)the study classified as a randomized controlled 
trial (RCT) or an observational study. Exclusion criteria were: 
i) The use of animal or cell models; ii) orlistat prescribed in 
combination with other therapeutic drugs; iii) the study classi￾fied as a review or case report; and iv) treatment of sub‑cohort 
groups with orlistat. No language restrictions were set.
Data extraction and quality assessment. The following data 
were extracted from the included studies: The first author, 
year of publication, sample size, length of follow‑up, patient 
characteristics (country, sex ratio, mean age and obesity status), 
intervention (dose, duration and diet), control (placebo or other), 
liver histological variables and biomarkers for liver function 
[alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase 
(AST), γ‑glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), TGs, glucose and 
HOMA‑IR]. Extracted data were verified by an independent 
investigator and any disagreements were resolved through discus￾sion with a second investigator until a consensus was reached. 
The Cochrane Risk of Bias tool (19) and the Newcastle‑Ottawa 
Quality Assessment Scale (20) were used to evaluate RCTs and 
observational studies, respectively. Safety was assessed based 
on reported treatment‑related adverse events.
Statistical analysis. RevMan software (version 5.3; Cochrane, 
London, UK) was used for statistical analysis. Post‑treatment 
and baseline values were extracted as means ± standard devia￾tions. For combined analyses, the mean difference (MD) or 
standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence 
interval (CI) to pool the extracted variables. The heteroge￾neity between studies was determined using the I2 statistic; 
I2 values of 25, 50 and 75% represented low, moderate and 
high heterogeneity, respectively (21). In cases with I2 <50%, 
a fixed‑effects model was used, whereas a random‑effects 
model was used if I2 >50%. P<0.05 was considered to indicate 
statistical significance.
Results
Literature search. The database searches yielded 75 studies, 
of which 14 were excluded due to duplication. Following 
screening of titles and abstracts for eligibility, 43 additional 
studies were excluded. Of the remaining 18 studies, 11 were 
excluded following assessment of the full‑text: Two confer￾ence abstracts, two duplicate protocols, one review, one case 
report, one study with sub‑cohort treatment with orlistat and 
four studies with no outcomes of interest. Ultimately, seven 
studies were analyzed (11‑13,17,22‑24) (Fig. 1).
Trial characteristics. Trial characteristics of the seven 
included studies are summarized in Table I. Briefly, the 
trials were published between 2004 and 2017 and included 
330 participants. The mean age of participants ranged from 
36.5 to 58.5 years, and in all but one trial, the obesity rate 
was 100%. The duration of orlistat intervention ranged from 
16 to 36 weeks, and in all studies, the dose administered was 
120 mg three times a day. The study by Fan et al (22) analyzed 
two treatment durations (12 and 24 weeks); due to more 
comprehensive reporting on the 24‑week data, the 24‑week 
group was selected for inclusion in the meta‑analysis.
Quality assessment. Quality assessment of the three included 
RCTs (11,17,23) was performed using the Cochrane Risk of 
Bias tool (Fig. 2). Overall, all three studies had a low risk of 
Figure 1. Flowchart of the literature search and study selection process.

92 BIOMEDICAL REPORTS 9: 90-96, 2018
bias in selective reporting and other areas. Additionally, two 
of the studies (17,23) had low risk of bias in random sequence 
generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and 
personnel, and blinding of outcome assessment. The number 
and cause of dropouts were identified for each study.
Quantitative data synthesis
ALT. ALT levels were reported in all included studies. 
Although between‑study heterogeneity was high (I2
=95%), 
orlistat post‑treatment significantly reduced ALT levels 
compared to baseline [SMD=‑1.41; 95% confidence interval 
(95% CI)=‑2.52 to ‑0.30; P=0.01]. Specific subgroup analysis 
indicated no significant improvement in ALT levels in patients 
with NAFLD (SMD=‑1.17; 95% CI=‑2.55 to 0.21; I2
=96%; 
P=0.1) or NASH (SMD=‑1.80; 95% CI=‑4.46 to 0.86; I2
=96%; 
P=0.18; Fig. 3A).
AST. AST levels were reported in six of the seven studies 
analyzed. Compared to baseline, orlistat treatment significantly 
reduced AST levels (SMD=‑2.06; 95% CI=‑3.23 to ‑0.89; 
P=0.0005); however, between‑study heterogeneity was high 
(I2
=93%). In the subgroup analysis, significant difference in 
AST was identified in patients with NAFLD (SMD=‑2.42; 
95% CI=‑3.95 to ‑0.90; I2
=93%; P=0.002), but not in those 
with NASH (SMD=‑1.75; 95% CI=‑4.17 to 0.67; I2
=95%; 
P=0.16; Fig. 3B).
GGT. The effect of orlistat on GGT levels reported in three 
studies was analyzed. Orlistat treatment significantly reduced 
GGT levels compared to baseline (SMD=‑1.91; 95% CI=‑3.79 
to ‑0.03; P=0.05); however, between‑study heterogeneity was 
high (I2
=96%; Fig. 3C).
Liver histology. In four studies included in the meta‑analysis, 
liver biopsies were administrated on admission and iterated 
following the treatment with orlistat. Fibrosis was scored on 
a scale from 0 to 4 (25). No significant differences between 
post‑treatment and baseline scores were observed (SMD=‑0.14; 
95% CI=‑0.88 to 0.60; P=0.71) in patients treated with orlistat. 
Between‑study heterogeneity was high (I2
=77%; Fig. 3D).
Glucose. Orlistat treatment caused significant reduction in 
fasting plasma glucose levels compared to baseline in patients

Plasma triglycerides. The effect of orlistat on TG levels 
in five studies was analyzed. Overall, despite high hetero￾geneity (I2
=88%), TG levels were significantly reduced 
following orlistat treatment compared to baseline (MD=‑0.93;

Mild gastrointestinal discomfort symptoms, including nausea, 
abdominal cramps, fecal urgency, fecal incontinence and 
increased defecation were also reported (11,12,17,22,24). No 
serious treatment‑related adverse effects on cardiovascular 
outcome or carcinogenesis were reported in any of the included 
studies.
Discussion
The present study to the best of our knowledge is the first 
systematic review and meta‑analysis investigating the efficacy 
and safety of orlistat intervention in patients with NAFLD or 
NASH. Following a review of the literature, seven trials were 
identified that satisfied the inclusion criteria. Although the 
results of the current analysis are limited by the relatively small 
number of studies included, the data suggest improvements in 
biochemical, metabolic and anthropometric indicators of liver 
disease and in overall safety by orlistat treatment in patients 
with NAFLD or NASH.
In the studies analyzed, orlistat improved biochemical 
markers of liver disease. Orlistat treatment reduced the levels 
of ALT, AST and GGT compared to baseline in patients with 
NAFLD; however, the subgroup analysis did not reveal signifi￾cant differences in patients with NASH. Aminotransferases 
are sensitive indicators of liver damage and cellular integrity 
and are mainly located in hepatocytes (14,15,26). When hepa￾tocytes are damaged, for example during liver disease, blood 
aminotransferase levels increase (15). It is considered that 
orlistat may reduce damage to hepatocytes by decreasing fat 
accumulation in the liver, and thereby decrease aminotrans￾ferase levels (23).
However, the effect of orlistat on liver histological variables 
remains unclear. Overall assessment of the four studies noting 
liver fibrosis score revealed no significant changes in the scores 
following treatment with orlistat compared to baseline. These 
results are consistent with those of Tilg and Moschen (27) who 
demonstrated that orlistat failed to improve the histopathology 
of NAFLD. Therefore, orlistat should not be considered as a 
medication for alleviating fibrosis in patients with NAFLD or 
NASH.
As an anti‑obesity drug, orlistat has been demonstrated to 
reduce postprandial lipid levels following high‑fat meals. A 
study by Gabriel et al (28) identified that administration of 
orlistat suppressed the postprandial rise of TG levels in healthy 
adult volunteers following consumption of meals with 50% fat. 
Nakou et al (29) observed a greater decrease in TG levels with 
ezetimibe plus orlistat therapy compared with monotherapy 
with ezetimibe alone. In the current meta‑analysis, TG 
levels were markedly improved following orlistat treatment 
compared to baseline, suggesting that orlistat may alleviate 
lipid accumulation, although statistical significance was not 
achieved in patients with NASH.
The present results also indicated that orlistat treatment 
reduced plasma glucose levels compared to baseline in patients 
with NAFLD and NASH. Kujawska‑Łuczak et al (30) observed 
similar results while examining the effect of orlistat on glucose/
insulin homeostasis in obese premenopausal women. Orlistat 
has been further indicated to improve glycemic control and 
insulin resistance, as well as reduce body weight gain and BMI, 
in patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes (31,32). Based on 
these data, the effect of orlistat on insulin resistance and BMI 
in patients with NAFLD was analyzed. HOMA‑IR was used to 
evaluate insulin resistance and BMI substituted for incomplete 
data on body weight. As expected, improvement in BMI was 
associated with improved insulin resistance, and HOMA‑IR 
scores and BMI were significantly lower following orlistat 
treatment compared to baseline.
Previous results have indicated that hepatic steatosis and 
inflammation may be improved by weight loss or reduction 
of BMI (33). However, Harrison et al (23) reported that no 
significant differences in hepatic steatosis and inflammation 
were found between orlistat/diet/vitamin E and diet/vitamin E 
groups. The limited information collected on this aspect in 
our included studies hampered analysis of hepatic steatosis, 
necroinflammation and ballooning. Of the included studies, 
only two reported on steatosis and inflammation (23,24), and 
one on ballooning (23). Thus, further studies are required to 
investigate whether orlistat may improve liver histology.
Several limitations of the current analysis should be noted. 
First, a relatively small number of studies and sample sizes 
were included in the meta‑analysis. Second, a high heteroge￾neity was observed, probably in part due to the small sample 
sizes, inconsistent duration of treatment, and lack of control 
groups, which prevented the evaluation of clinically significant 
conclusions. Third, only three studies investigated liver histo￾logical variables in patients with NAFLD and NASH.
In conclusion, the present systematic review and 
meta‑analysis assessed the effect of the anti‑obesity drug orli￾stat on various disease biomarkers in patients with NAFLD 
and NASH. The results suggest that, although orlistat does not 
consistently reverse liver fibrosis, it appears to improve other 
biochemical, metabolic and anthropometric indicators and to 
a certain extent, may contribute to prognosis. However, due to 
the limited sample size and high heterogeneity, these findings 
did not prove statistically significant in all subgroup analyses. 
Nonetheless, the data support the use of orlistat as a therapeutic 
strategy to improve biochemical indicators of liver damage, 
but not as a drug of choice for the management of NAFLD or 
NASH. Larger sample sizes and additional liver histological 
parameters (including hepatic steatosis, ballooning, necro￾inflammation and fibrosis) should be assessed over a longer 
follow‑up period in future studies.
