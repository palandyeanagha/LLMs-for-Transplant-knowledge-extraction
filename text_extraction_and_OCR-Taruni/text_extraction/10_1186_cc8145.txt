Abstract
Introduction While propofol is associated with an infusion
syndrome (PRIS) that may cause death, the incidence of PRIS
is unknown. Determining the incidence of PRIS and the
frequency of PRIS-related clinical manifestations are key steps
prior to the completion of any controlled studies investigating
PRIS. This prospective, multicenter study sought to determine
the incidence of PRIS and PRIS-related clinical manifestations
in a large cohort of critically ill adults prescribed propofol.
Methods Critically ill adults from 11 academic medical centers
administered an infusion of propofol for [>/=] 24 hours were
monitored at baseline and then on a daily basis until propofol
was discontinued for the presence of 11 different PRIS￾associated clinical manifestations and risk factors derived from
83 published case reports of PRIS.
Results Among 1017 patients [medical (35%), neurosurgical
(25%)], PRIS (defined as metabolic acidosis plus cardiac
dysfunction and [>/=] 1 of: rhabdomyolysis,
hypertriglyceridemia or renal failure occurring after the start of
propofol therapy) developed in 11 (1.1%) patients an average of
3 (1-6) [median (range)] days after the start of propofol. While
most (91%) of the patients who developed PRIS were receiving
a vasopressor (80% initiated after the start of propofol therapy),
few received a propofol dose >83 mcg/kg/min (18%) or died
(18%). Compared to the 1006 patients who did not develop
PRIS, the APACHE II score (25 +/- 6 vs 20 +/- 7, P = 0.01) was
greater in patients with PRIS but both the duration of propofol
use (P = 0.43) and ICU length of stay (P = 0.82) were similar.
Conclusions Despite using a conservative definition for PRIS,
and only considering new-onset PRIS clinical manifestations,
APACHE: acute physiology and chronic health evaluation; CPK: creatinine phosphokinase; FDA: Food and Drug Administration; ICU: intensive care 
unit; PRIS: propofol-related infusion syndrome.

the incidence of PRIS slightly exceeds 1%. Future controlled
studies focusing on evaluating whether propofol manifests the
derangements of critical illness more frequently than other
sedatives will need to be large. These studies should also
investigate the mechanism(s) and risk factors for PRIS.
Introduction
Propofol has been commonly used as a sedative in the inten￾sive care unit (ICU) for more than 20 years and, when pre￾scribed based on product labeling recommendations, is
generally considered safe [1]. Nevertheless, a troubling syn￾drome known as the propofol-related infusion syndrome
(PRIS) exists, which was first reported 17 years ago in five
pediatric ICU patients who developed metabolic acidosis,
bradyarrhythmias and progressive myocardial failure after
receiving propofol at a high dose [2]. Since this initial report,
78 additional cases of PRIS have been published with a mor￾tality rate exceeding 80% [3-57]. In addition, a recent analysis
of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) MEDWATCH sys￾tem identified a further 1139 suspected cases of PRIS that
were associated with 30% mortality [58]. Postulated risk fac￾tors for PRIS include use of a high propofol dose (>83 μg/kg/
min), a duration of therapy less than 48 hours and concomitant
vasopressor therapy [59-61].
Despite an increasing awareness among clinicians regarding
this syndrome, and the large number of recent publications
surrounding it, a number of unresolved questions exist. For
example, the clinical manifestations that make up PRIS remain
vague because many of these reflect either common pharma￾cologic manifestations of propofol (e.g. bradycardia) or com￾mon manifestations of critical illness (e.g. metabolic acidosis)
[60,61]. Furthermore, the incidence of PRIS among critically ill
adults is currently unknown given the voluntary nature by
which adverse events are reported to the FDA MEDWATCH
system, the propensity for only those cases associated with a
poor outcome (e.g. death) to be reported and the total number
of patients exposed to propofol that these PRIS cases repre￾sents is unknown [58].
Determining the incidence of PRIS and the frequency of PRIS￾related clinical manifestations in a large cohort of critically ill
patients is a crucial step when designing large, controlled
studies investigating PRIS (e.g., propofol vs. non-propofol reg￾imens). We therefore sought to: identify the incidence of PRIS
in a large cohort of critically ill adults receiving propofol for
more than 24 hours; determine the frequency by which individ￾ual PRIS clinical manifestations and risk factors occur; and
estimate sample size requirements for future controlled stud￾ies surrounding PRIS.
Materials and methods
This prospective, observational study was approved by the
Institutional Review Board at each of the 11 academic medical
centers where it was conducted and the need for informed
consent was waived at each site. From 1 April to 30 Novem￾ber, 2008, adults admitted to an ICU and treated with propofol
for at least 24 hours were evaluated. Patients were excluded if
they had rhabdomyolysis (creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) ≥
10,000 IU/L) prior to propofol exposure, an admission history
of familial mitochondrial disease, a prognosis considered to be
hopeless by the admitting physician or who had prior exposure
to propofol during the current hospital admission.
At the time of enrollment, the following baseline demographic
data was collected: age, gender, past medical history, ICU
admitting service, primary ICU admitting diagnosis and the
Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II
score at ICU admission [62]. The specific PRIS-associated
clinical manifestations and risk factors used in this study were
identified from PRIS published case reports [2-57]. These
case reports were identified from a MEDLINE search (1980 to
December 2007), using the following search terms: propofol,
propofol infusion syndrome, propofol-related infusion syn￾drome, PRIS, rhabdomyolysis and adverse drug events. This
strategy is similar to that used in a recent evaluation of the FDA
MEDWATCH database [58].
Based on the above analysis, PRIS-associated clinical mani￾festations were grouped under nine categories and defined as
follows: rhabdomyolysis (CPK ≥ 10,000 IU/L); hypotension
(systolic blood pressure ≤ 90 mmHg or current use of a vaso￾pressor agent); hepatic transaminitis (increase in the aspartate
aminotransferase and/or alanine aminotransferase ≥ 3 times
above baseline); metabolic acidosis (arterial pH ≤ 7.30 along
with a serum bicarbonate ≤ 18 mg/dL); hypertriglyceridemia
(serum triglyceride concentration ≥ 400 mg/dL); hypoxia (par￾tial pressure of arterial oxygen ≤ 60 mmHg); hyperthermia
(temperature ≥ 38.3°C); cardiac dysfunction that included a
Brugada-like ECG pattern, asystole, pulseless electrical activ￾ity, ventricular fibrillation, sustained ventricular tachycardia of
30 seconds or longer, myocardial failure (ejection fraction ≤
40%), or bradycardia (heart rate ≤ 50 bpm not felt to be
related to a medication other than propofol); and renal failure
that included oliguria (urine output ≤ 0.5 mL/kg/hr for ≥ 6
hours), anuria (urine output ≤ 10 mL/hr for ≥ 6 hours), elevation
in serum creatinine (increase of ≥ 1 mg/dL from baseline), or
hyperkalemia (serum K+ ≥ 6 mg/dL (excluding other known
causes or hemolyzed specimens)). A patient was deemed to
have experienced a particular manifestation category if they
experienced any manifestation within the category. The pres￾ence of known risk factors for PRIS (i.e., a high propofol dose
(= 83 μg/kg/min (5 mg/kg/hr)) at any time point and concom￾itant vasopressor therapy) were also identified [59-61].

Patients were monitored daily for the presence of each PRIS
manifestation and risk factor by an experienced critical care
pharmacist at baseline, during the period of propofol adminis￾tration (up to 30 days), and then for 24 hours after propofol
was discontinued. The presence of each PRIS clinical mani￾festation predefined by specific clinical and laboratory values
was based on the worst value for each value in the prior 24
hours. Although all progress notes, ICU flow sheets and med￾ication administration records were reviewed, use of additional
laboratory testing and/or diagnostic assessment outside of
that which occurred as a part of routine clinical practice was
not mandated as part of the study. The pharmacists who col￾lected data were instructed not to share any information
related to the data they collected with the clinical team nor
make interventions pertaining to propofol therapy. All data
were recorded on a study case report form and then entered
into a secure web-based database.
For the purposes of this study, PRIS was defined as the devel￾opment of metabolic acidosis and cardiac dysfunction along
with at least one of rhabdomyolysis, hypertriglyceridemia or
renal failure after the initiation of propofol therapy. This defini￾tion was based on a review of 83 published reports of PRIS,
incorporated each pertinent PRIS-associated clinical manifes￾tation listed above and was finalized through investigator con￾sensus. The presence of hypotension, hepatic transaminitis,
hypoxia and hyperthermia were not included in the PRIS defi￾nition given the low incidence by which they are reported in
published case series and the fact that they are commonly
observed in the critically ill. Other analyses compared demo￾graphic factors, the duration of both propofol use and ICU
stay, and patient outcome between PRIS and non-PRIS
patients. Additionally, the number of new-onset PRIS-related
clinical manifestations experienced per patient, the manner
and timing by which the PRIS definition was met, the fre￾quency of each PRIS-related clinical manifestation and the
number of PRIS-related clinical manifestations for each day of
therapy was determined.
Patient characteristics and outcomes were expressed as
mean ± standard deviation, median and interquartile range
(IQR) or percent where appropriate. Comparisons between
groups were performed using the Student's t-test, Mann-Whit￾ney U test or the chi-squared test with the Yates correction
where appropriate. A P value of less than 0.05 was consid￾ered significant for all analyses. All statistical analyses were
performed using SPSS 16.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA).
Results
Among the 1017 patients followed, 1.1% (11/1017) devel￾oped PRIS as it was defined for the purposes of the study (i.e.,
development of metabolic acidosis and cardiac dysfunction
along with at least one of: rhabdomyolysis, hypertriglyceri￾demia or renal failure after the initiation of propofol therapy).
The development of metabolic acidosis, cardiac dysfunction
and renal failure after the start of propofol therapy accounted
for the definition of PRIS being met in all patients where PRIS
was identified. One of the PRIS patients also developed
hypertriglyceridemia. None of the patients who met our defini￾tion for PRIS had rhabdomyolysis nor did their cardiac dys￾function consist of a Brugada-like ECG pattern. Most (91%)
of the 11 PRIS patients received vasopressor therapy. In 80%
of cases, vasopressor therapy was initiated after propofol ther￾apy was started. Few of the PRIS patients (18%) were admin￾istered a dose of propofol that exceeded 83 μg/kg/min at any
point over the course of therapy.
Relative to the start of propofol therapy, the first two PRIS￾defining clinical manifestations (i.e. metabolic acidosis, car￾diac dysfunction, or renal failure), on average, occurred at
[median (range)] 1 (1 to 3) days with the third (and defining)
PRIS clinical manifestation occurring at a median of 3 (1 to 6)
days (Figure 1). Two of the 11 patients with PRIS experienced
all three PRIS-defining clinical manifestations on the first day
after propofol was started with 10 of 11 patients experiencing
all three manifestations within three days. Among the 11
patients only patients number 6 and number 11 died and only
patients number 6 and number 8 were exposed to a propofol
dose exceeding 83 μg/kg/min. Demographic variables and
clinical outcomes were similar between the 11 patients who
experienced PRIS and the 1006 patients who did not with the
exception that the 11 patients with PRIS had a higher
APACHE II score at ICU admission (P = 0.03) and were more
likely to be admitted to a surgical service other than trauma or
neurosurgery (P = 0.04; Table 1)
The frequency of each PRIS-associated clinical manifestation,
stratified by whether it was present at baseline or developed
after the start of propofol therapy, is presented in Figure 2a. In
addition, the frequencies of the individual cardiac and renal
PRIS clinical manifestations are presented in Figure 2b. Inter￾estingly, among the total cohort of patients followed, 30% did
not experience a new-onset PRIS clinical manifestation after
propofol therapy was started (Figure 3). However, for the 70%
of patients who experienced one or more new-onset PRIS￾associated clinical manifestation, 57.4% (410/710) experi￾enced two or more manifestations. The cumulative average
number of new-onset PRIS clinical manifestations, on a per￾patient basis, when censored to the number of days that pro￾pofol was administered, increased each day over the first 10
days of propofol therapy (Figure 4).
Discussion
Our study is the first large, prospective study to identify the
incidence of PRIS in critically ill adults administered propofol
for longer than 24 hours. Although other reports have tried to
characterize PRIS and identify the incidence of this syndrome,
the conclusions that can be drawn from these reports are lim￾ited due to their retrospective nature, the fact that they
included either patients who were not critically ill or who

received propofol for only a short duration
[11,13,14,28,31,32,34,35,37,46,52,63]. Given the increas￾ing number of often fatal case reports of PRIS that have been
published involving critically ill adults, this study provides valu￾able insight into a complex and poorly characterized syn￾drome. Although our study suggests that the incidence of
PRIS is low, the actual number of cases that occur in the
United States each year may be substantial given that five mil￾lion patients are admitted to an ICU each year and that propo￾fol is the preferred sedative for critically ill adults by up to 80%
of clinicians [64,65].
Our study also provides clinicians with valuable information
towards the design of future controlled studies investigating
PRIS. Based on the estimate of PRIS we identified in our
study, and assuming a power of 80% and a P < 0.05, a future
comparative (i.e., propofol vs. non-propofol) trial would require
2068 patients in each arm to detect a 70% relative decrease
in the incidence of PRIS and 10,795 patients in each group to
detect a 25% relative decrease in the incidence of PRIS.
PRIS was first defined by Bray in 1998 as a sudden onset of
marked bradycardia, resistant to treatment, with progression
to asystole plus one of the following: hyperlipidemia, fatty infil￾tration of the liver, severe metabolic acidosis, or muscle
involvement with evidence of rhabdomyolysis or myoglobinuria
[10]. Other definitions have been proposed that incorporate a
combination of PRIS symptoms or just a single PRIS manifes￾tation but a lack of consensus surrounding a definition for
PRIS exists [17,60,63]. The definition chosen to define PRIS
in our study is consistent with published PRIS case reports
[10,57,59,60,66]. Among the 83 published PRIS case
reports, the most common first-reported signs of PRIS are
new-onset metabolic acidosis (86%) and cardiac dysfunction
(88%) [2-57]. The occurrence of other manifestations is less
frequent and includes new-onset rhabdomyolysis (45%), renal
failure (37%), and hypertriglyceridemia (15%) [2-57]. There￾fore, we feel that our definition of PRIS is both evidence-based
and conservative. However, it must be acknowledged that
there may be a wide variation in the true incidence of PRIS
depending on how PRIS is defined in terms of either the
number and/or type of PRIS-related clinical manifestations
experienced by the patient.
Many differences exist between our cohort and published
case reports [2-57]. For example, among the 71 published
PRIS cases where the dose of propofol was provided, 86%
received a dose exceeding 83 μg/kg/min whereas among the
11 patients in our cohort who developed PRIS, a dose this
high was administered in only 18% [2,4,8,20,23,26,28,29,34,
42-45,47,51,52,55-57,60,63,66,67]. This is surprising given
the relatively high severity of illness of our cohort and the fact
that 25% of the patients were admitted to a neurosurgical
service - a population of patients that frequently requires pro￾pofol at high doses for a prolonged period of time [68]. It may
be possible that the patients who developed PRIS were being
administered far greater doses of propofol than was docu￾mented in the patient record given recent reports of intrave￾nous smart pump practices demonstrating that propofol is the
most likely drug to be delivered as a bolus in the ICU [65].
Another possible explanation for the low use (10%) of high￾dose propofol in our overall cohort may relate to the fact that
sedation guidelines advocating a maximum dose of propofol
ranging from 60 to 83 μg/kg/min were in place at 10 of the 11

institutions who participated in the study and that a critical
care pharmacist promoted these guidelines on a daily basis.
The fact that the time from the start of propofol to the time
PRIS was identified is longer in published PRIS case reports
(median 2.5 days) than our study is likely attributable to the
fact that monitoring for PRIS occurred immediately after pro￾pofol was started in our study and that the clinicians caring for
our patients in our study may have been more aware of PRIS
given the numerous recent publications surrounding it.
A third important difference between our 11 patients with
PRIS and published case reports of adults developing PRIS
relate to the fact that none of our PRIS patients developed
rhabdomyolysis. Possible reasons for this disparity include the
fact that the definition we chose for rhabdomyolysis in our
study was frequently more stringent than the definition
employed in the 45% of the adult case reports where rhab￾domyolysis occurred. Other potential reasons for the lack of
identified rhabdomyolysis in our 11 patients include the fact
that CPK monitoring was not mandated as a part of our study
and the fact that neurosurgical patients (an adult population
with the highest incidence of rhabdomyolysis) only made up
one-quarter of our cohort.
The mortality rate among our PRIS patients (18%) was mark￾edly lower than that reported in published case reports or that
predicted by their ICU admission APACHE II score (53%)
[60,62,66,69]. Potential reasons for this discrepancy include
the fact that only case reports resulting in the worse outcome
(e.g. death) are usually published, that pediatric patients were
excluded from our analysis (a population with worse outcomes
from PRIS than adults), that only one-quarter of our cohort was
admitted to a neurosurgical service (a population of patients
who have a baseline mortality rate of more than 50% and who
frequently require propofol at high doses for a prolonged dura￾tion), and that APACHE II score may overestimate patient mor￾Figure 2

tality given the improvements in ICU care that have occurred
over the 25 years since it was first validated [68,70,71].
Recent evidence suggests that PRIS may occur from an over￾lap of priming (i.e. baseline critical illness) and triggering (i.e.
use of high-dose propofol) factors [60]. For example, a patient
with cardiac dysfunction prior to the start of propofol therapy
may be at greater risk for experiencing hypotension, renal fail￾ure and metabolic acidosis after propofol therapy is initiated.
When we included patients who experienced PRIS manifesta￾tions both in the 24 hours prior to the start of propofol therapy
and after propofol therapy was initiated, the incidence of PRIS
increased to 4.7%. Although the incidence of PRIS is very
unlikely to be as high as 4.7%, further research is required to
determine the influence that a PRIS clinical manifestation
present prior to the start of propofol therapy plays in causing
PRIS.
There are a number of potential limitations to our study. By not
evaluating a control group of patients receiving a non-propofol

sedation regimen(s), it remains unclear if the clinical symptoms
of PRIS that were identified were truly a result of propofol ther￾apy or related to some other manifestation of critical illness
and thus our reported incidence of PRIS may be greater than
what truly exists. The specific cause for each PRIS-associated
clinical manifestation (e.g. unexplained metabolic acidosis)
was not investigated (e.g. additional diagnostic testing) out￾side of that which would occur in routine clinical practice. The
incidence of PRIS may have been higher than our reported
value if laboratory monitoring was required to determine PRIS
manifestations such as rhabdomyolysis and hypertriglyceri￾demia. Finally, we did not mandate the discontinuation of pro￾pofol as a part of the study when PRIS was detected and thus
cannot reliably estimate the resolution of PRIS in these situa￾tions.
Conclusions
In summary, the incidence of PRIS in a heterogeneous popu￾lation of critically ill adults prescribed propofol for more than
24 hours is approximately 1% and can occur soon after the ini￾tiation of propofol therapy and at low doses. In contrast to
most of the published PRIS case reports, most of the patients
in our cohort who developed PRIS survived and rhabdomyoly￾sis did not occur. Data from both our study and previously pub￾lished reports of PRIS suggest that PRIS may occur when
propofol is administered at a low dose (<83 μg/kg/min) or for
a short duration [11,13,14,28,31,32,34,35,37,39,46,52,63].
This suggests that clinicians should monitor patients for signs
of PRIS from the time that propofol is initiated regardless of
the propofol dose that is administered and over the entire
course of propofol therapy. Based on the findings of our study,
future controlled studies investigating PRIS will need to be
large (at least 2,000 patients per arm). In addition, future stud￾ies will need to explore the mechanisms and risk factors asso￾ciated with PRIS and investigate whether propofol manifests
the derangements of critical illness more than other sedatives
(e.g. benzodiazepines, dexmedetomidine).

Key messages
• This study was the first to prospectively evaluate a large 
population of critically ill adults receiving longer-term 
propofol and to use an evidence-based and conserva￾tive definition for PRIS, and identified PRIS in 1.1% of 
patients.
• Compared with the 43 published case reports of PRIS 
in adults, our patients who developed PRIS developed 
it both faster after the start of propofol and at a lower 
propofol dose, had a lower mortality rate, and were less 
likely to experience rhabdomyolysis.
• Future comparative (i.e. propofol vs. non-propofol) trials 
surrounding PRIS will need to be large (from 2068 to 
10,795 patients in each arm) depending on what the 
difference in PRIS between groups is deemed to be 
clinically significant.
