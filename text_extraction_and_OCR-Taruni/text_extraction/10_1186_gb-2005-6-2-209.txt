Summary
Vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) are a family of secreted polypeptides with a highly
conserved receptor-binding cystine-knot structure similar to that of the platelet-derived growth
factors. VEGF-A, the founding member of the family, is highly conserved between animals as
evolutionarily distant as fish and mammals. In vertebrates, VEGFs act through a family of cognate
receptor tyrosine kinases in endothelial cells to stimulate blood-vessel formation. VEGF-A has
important roles in mammalian vascular development and in diseases involving abnormal growth of
blood vessels; other VEGFs are also involved in the development of lymphatic vessels and
disease-related angiogenesis. Invertebrate homologs of VEGFs and VEGF receptors have been
identified in fly, nematode and jellyfish, where they function in developmental cell migration and
neurogenesis. The existence of VEGF-like molecules and their receptors in simple invertebrates
without a vascular system indicates that this family of growth factors emerged at a very early
stage in the evolution of multicellular organisms to mediate primordial developmental functions.

The formation of a vascular system is a prerequisite for ver￾tebrate embryogenesis and involves two fundamental
processes: vasculogenesis, defined as the differentiation of
endothelial cell progenitors and their assembly into the
primary capillary plexus, and angiogenesis, the sprouting of
new capillaries from pre-existing vessels [1]. In the adult,
angiogenesis is also essential during pregnancy and in tissue
growth and repair, and is a key underlying process in the
pathogenesis of several major human diseases, including
cancer. Since its discovery in 1983 [2] and the subsequent
cloning of the gene in 1989 [3,4], vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF-A, also called VEGF or vascular perme￾ability factor) has emerged as the single most important reg￾ulator of blood vessel formation in health and disease; it is
essential for embryonic vasculogenesis and angiogenesis,
and is a key mediator of neovascularization in cancer and
other diseases [1]. VEGF-A is the prototypical member of a
family of related growth factors that includes placental
growth factor (PLGF), VEGF-B, VEGF-C, and VEGF-D (also
known as c-Fos-induced growth factor, FIGF), and the viral
VEGF-Es encoded by strains D1701, NZ2 and NZ7 of the
parapoxvirus Orf (which causes pustular dermatitis) [5,6].
The biological functions of the VEGFs are mediated by a
family of cognate protein tyrosine kinase receptors
(VEGFRs) [7-9]. VEGF-A binds to VEGFR2 (also called
KDR/Flk-1) and VEGFR1 (Flt-1); VEGF-C and VEGF-D bind
VEGFR2 and VEGFR3 (Flt4); PLGF and VEGF-B bind only
to VEGFR1; and VEGF-E binds only to VEGFR2. In addition,
certain VEGF family isoforms bind to non-tyrosine kinase
receptors called neuropilins (NRPs) [10,11].
Gene organization and evolutionary history 
Evolution 
VEGFs belong to the VEGF/PDGF (platelet-derived growth
factor) group of the cystine-knot superfamily of hormones
and extracellular signaling molecules [12], which are all
characterized by the presence of eight conserved cysteine

residues forming the typical cystine-knot structure (named
after cystine, a dimer of two cysteines linked by a disulfide
bond). The VEGF/PDGF group is evolutionarily related to
other groups within the cystine-knot superfamily, notably
the glycoprotein hormone and mucin-like protein families
and, more distantly, the transforming growth factor- (TGF-
) family. The absence of any of these proteins in unicellular
eukaryotes such as yeast suggests that the cystine-knot
structure evolved to perform hormonal and extracellular￾signaling functions in multicellular organisms with tissue￾level organization. 
The known members of the human VEGF family are shown
in Table 1. VEGFs have been found in all vertebrate species
so far examined and are highly conserved between species.
VEGF-A has been found in teleost fish (the zebrafish Danio
rerio and the pufferfish Fugu rubripes), frogs (Xenopus
laevis), birds (Gallus gallus), and mammals (Table 1). The
sequence and genomic organization of the vertebrate VEGF￾A genes is highly conserved between teleost fish and
mammals, even though separation of these two groups from
their common ancestor occurred around 450 million years
ago: pufferfish VEGF-A shows 68% and 69.7% amino-acid
identity with human and mouse VEGF-A, respectively [13].
VEGF-like proteins emerged relatively early in the evolution
of multicellular animal life, as indicated by their presence in
several invertebrate species. Invertebrate VEGF/VEGFR
systems have been identified in fly (Drosophila
melanogaster), nematode (Caenorhabditis elegans) and,
most recently, jellyfish (Podocoryne carnea). Drosophila has
three PDGF/VEGF-like factors (PVFs), which act through a

single receptor, PVR [14-16]. In C. elegans, four VEGFRs,
VERs (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor related) 1,
2, 3 and 4, have been identified [17]. Definitive identification
of a VER ligand is awaited, although a putative homolog of
Drosophila PVF1 was revealed by a survey of the C. elegans
genome [17]. A single VEGF/VEGFR system has been found
in P. carnea [18], with the VEGF being a possible homolog of
Drosophila PVF1. In all cases, the invertebrate ligands appear
to be more closely related to the VEGFs than to the PDGFs.
Alignment of the VEGF/PDGF homology domains (VHD) of
VEGFs, PDGFs and PVFs, encompassing the residues
making up the cystine-knot structure, reveals a high degree
of regional conservation (Figure 1a). The eight cysteine
residues of the cystine-knot structure are highly conserved,
except in Drosophila PVF2, which lacks cysteine 2, and
human PDGF-C and PDGF-D, which both lack cysteine 4.
Phylogenetic analysis of these sequences reveals that the
VEGF/PDGF family tree is essentially composed of two
branches evolved from a putative common ancestor, a VEGF
branch comprising VEGFs A-D, PLGF, Orf virus encoded
VEGF-Es and Drosophila PVFs 1-3, and a PDGF branch,
comprising PDGFs A-D (Figure 1b). Within the human
VEGF family, VEGF-A is most closely related to PLGF (53%
amino-acid identity within the VHD [19]). The Orf virus￾encoded VEGF-Es segregate into two groups, with VEGF￾E(D1701) and VEGF-E(NZ2) most closely related to VEGF-A and
PLGF, and VEGF-E(NZ7) more similar to VEGF-C and VEGF￾D. The Drosophila PVFs are more closely related to the
VEGFs than the PDGFs, albeit distantly, with PVF1 most
closely related to VEGF-C and VEGF-D (Figure 1b).
Gene structure and alternative splicing
The gene structures and encoded functional domains of
human and Drosophila VEGFs are shown in Figure 2. The
human VEGF genes are characterized by a highly conserved
seven exon structure, with the exception of VEGF-A, which
has eight exons. Alternative splicing of the human VEGF-A
gene gives rise to at least six different transcripts (Table 2),
encoding isoforms of the following lengths (in amino acids,
excluding the signal peptide): 121 (120 in mouse), 145, 165
(164 in mouse), 183, 189 and 206 [20]. All transcripts
contain exons 1-5 and 8, with diversity generated through
the alternative splicing of exons 6 and 7. A hydrophobic
signal sequence essential for secretion of VEGF-A is encoded
within exon 1 and a small region of exon 2, and the VHD is
encoded by exons 3 and 4. Human VEGF-A121 and VEGF￾A165 and their equivalents in other species are the two major
isoforms in mammals; VEGF-A121 lacks exons 6 and 7, and
VEGF-A165 lacks exon 6 (Table 2). Exon 6 encodes a heparin￾binding domain, while exons 7 and 8 encode a
NRP1/heparin-binding domain; with the exception of
VEGF-A121, all isoforms are thought to bind the polysaccha￾ride heparin. VEGF-A165 binds to NRP1 and NRP2, whereas
VEGF-A145 binds only to NRP2 [10,11]. Recently, another
splice variant of human VEGF-A was identified, VEGF-A165b,
which lacks exon 6 and contains an alternative exon 8
encoding a novel carboxy-terminal sequence, thereby raising
the possibility of the existence of a family of sister isoforms
containing this novel carboxyl terminus [21].
Human PLGF exists in four isoforms, PLGF-1 to PLGF-4,
with PLGF-1 and PLGF-2 believed to be the major isoforms.
The PLGF-1 and PLGF-2 transcripts encode isoforms
(excluding signal peptide) of 131 and 152 amino acid
residues, respectively. PLGF-2 is able to bind heparin and
NRP1 through an exon 6 encoded heparin-binding domain
[22]; PLGF-1 lacks exon 6 and is thus unable to bind heparin
[19]. PLGF-3 also lacks exon 6 but additionally contains a
216-nucleotide insertion between exons 4 and 5. PLGF-4
consists of the same sequence as PLGF-3, plus the heparin￾binding domain encoded by exon 6. PLGF-3 and PLGF-4
may function similarly to the larger VEGF-A isoforms,
VEGF-A189 and VEGF-A206. In mice, PLGF-2 is the only
PLGF isoform identified so far.
Alternative splicing of the human VEGF-B gene gives rise to
two transcripts, encoding isoforms (excluding signal
peptide) of 167 and 186 amino acid residues, differing only
in their carboxy-terminal domains [23,24]. VEGF-B186 tran￾scripts contain the entire exon 6 and encode a soluble
isoform. In VEGF-B167 transcripts, the use of an alternative
splice acceptor site in exon 6 introduces a frameshift, result￾ing in an alternative exon 6 (referred to as exon 6b in [23]),
encoding an NRP1/heparin-binding domain similar to that
encoded by exons 7 and 8 in VEGF-A165.
Little is known about alternative splicing of human VEGF-C
and VEGF-D, although multiple isoforms of mouse VEGF-D
have been described [25]. VEGF-C and VEGF-D are closely
related, both structurally and functionally. Both are ligands
for VEGFR2 and VEGFR3 and are initially synthesized as
disulfide-linked polypeptides containing amino- and
carboxy-terminal propeptide extensions not found in other
VEGF proteins, flanking a central receptor-binding VHD.
The unprocessed full-length forms preferentially bind
VEGFR3 and have low affinity for VEGFR2, whereas the
fully processed forms have increased affinity for VEGFR2
[26,27]. VEGF-C and VEGF-D lack the NRP/heparin￾binding domain found in some VEGF isoforms and appear to
be unable to bind NRPs.
Characteristic structural features 
The crystal structure of VEGF-A8-109, comprising the VHD,
has been determined [28] and subsequently refined to a res￾olution of 1.93 Å. These studies show that VEGF-A consists
of two monomers, each containing a core cystine-knot struc￾ture held together by three intrachain disulphide bonds as in
the structure of PDGF; the monomers are arranged head-to￾tail in a homodimer with two interchain disulphide bridges.
Mutational analysis has revealed that symmetrical binding

sites for VEGFR2 are located at each pole of the homodimer
and has identified key residues in each site involved in
ligand-receptor interactions [28]. The crystal structure of
PLGF19-116, comprising the VHD, bound to the second
immunoglobulin-like loop of VEGFR1 reveals that PLGF and
VEGF-A bind to the same region of VEGFR1 in a very similar
manner [29], despite only modest sequence conservation
(50%) between the two ligands. 
The binding of VEGFs to NRP1 appears to be mediated by
two distinct domains. In VEGF-A, these correspond to the
basic heparin-binding domain encoded by exon 6 and the
NRP1/heparin-binding domain encoded by exons 7 and 8
[10]. The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) structure of
the 55 carboxy-terminal residues of VEGF-A165, containing
the NRP1/heparin-binding domain encoded by exons 7 and
8, reveals this region to be composed of two subdomains,

each containing two disulphide bridges and a short two￾stranded antiparallel  sheet, with the carboxy-terminal sub￾domain additionally containing a short  helix [30].
VEGF-B167 also binds NRP1 via an NRP1/heparin-binding
domain [31], encoded by an alternative exon 6 and part of
exon 7; this has strong similarity to the domain encoded by
exons 7 and 8 in VEGF-A165 (Figure 2). PLGF-2 binds NRP1
through its exon-6-encoded basic domain, which is similar
to that encoded by exon 6 of VEGF-A. The VEGF-A145
isoform, which lacks exon 7, binds NRP2, presumably
through its exon-6-encoded domain [11].
Localization and function 
Cellular localization, expression patterns and
regulation
The VEGFs are all secreted proteins. VEGF-A121 and VEGF￾A165 are secreted as covalently linked homodimeric proteins,
whereas the larger isoforms, VEGF-A189 and VEGF-A206,
although believed to be secreted, are not readily diffusible and
may remain sequestered in the extracellular matrix (Table 2).
VEGF bioavailability may be regulated by plasmin-mediated
proteolysis in the carboxy-terminal domains of the larger
matrix-bound VEGF isoforms, such as VEGF-A189, to release
more diffusible, biologically active species [32]. Human
VEGF-A165, the most abundant and biologically active form, is
glycosylated at Asn74 and is typically expressed as a 46 kDa
homodimer of 23 kDa subunits. VEGF-A121 has biological
activity in endothelial cells, but has lower potency than VEGF￾A165. The amino- and carboxy-terminal propeptide domains of
VEGF-C and VEGF-D are proteolytically cleaved, possibly by
plasmin, releasing the VHD during or after secretion to gener￾ate a fully processed mature form, which forms noncovalent
homodimers of approximately 21 kDa that bind VEGFR2 with
greatly increased affinity [26,27]. 
Most information on the localization and expression of
VEGFs has been derived from studies on VEGF-A. During
embryogenesis in the mouse, VEGF-A can be detected from
embryonic day 7 (E7) in the extra-embryonic and embryonic
endoderm, and by E8.5 it is present at high levels in the tro￾phoblast surrounding the embryo and in the embryonic
myocardium, gut endoderm, embryonic mesenchyme and
amniotic ectoderm. Later in development, VEGF-A is
expressed in the mesenchyme and neuroectoderm of the
head [33]. VEGF-A expression declines in most tissues in the
weeks after birth and is relatively low in most adult organs,
except in a few vascular beds, including those of the brain
choroid plexus, lung alveoli, kidney glomeruli and heart.
VEGF-A expression is also upregulated during specific physi￾ological processes such as development of the endocrine
corpus luteum in pregnancy, wound healing and tissue
repair, and in diseases associated with neovascularization
(formation of new blood vessels). VEGF-A is produced by
diverse cell types, including aortic vascular smooth muscle
cells, keratinocytes, macrophages and many tumor cells [34].
Oxygen tension is a key physiological regulator of VEGF-A
gene expression [35]. The VEGF-A gene contains hypoxia￾responsive enhancer elements (HREs) in its 5 and 3 UTRs
[36,37], the 3 enhancer being similar to sequences within
the HRE of the gene encoding the hormone erythropoietin.
Transcriptional regulation of the VEGF-A gene by hypoxia is
mediated by binding of the transcription factor HIF-1
(hypoxia-inducible transcription factor 1) to the HRE. HIF-1
is a heterodimer composed of HIF-1 and HIF-1 subunits,
both of which are members of the basic helix-loop-helix-PAS
family [38]. HIF-1 is normally very labile, but under
hypoxic conditions, it accumulates because proteasomal
degradation is inhibited: at normal oxygen tension, proline
hydroxylation targets HIF-1 for proteasomal degradation,
but is inhibited by hypoxia because of the requirement of the
responsible prolyl hydroxylases for molecular dioxygen. The
product of the Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor-suppressor
gene is also required for proteasomal proteolysis: a genetic
deficiency of this protein causes VHL disease, a condition
characterized by retinal and cerebellar capillary heman￾gioblastomas (small, highly vascular tumors). In addition,

VEGF-A mRNA is stabilized under conditions of low oxygen
tension as a result of binding of unidentified factors to its 3
UTR. VEGF-A gene expression is also upregulated by a
variety of growth factors and cytokines, including PDGF-BB,
TGF-, basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2), interleukin￾1 and interleukin-6, some of which can act synergistically
with hypoxia [1].
Function
All of the vertebrate VEGFs and their cognate receptors
studied so far are able to regulate angiogenesis, and several
have key biological roles in the formation of vascular struc￾tures either during development or in the adult. VEGFR
function and signaling is reviewed extensively elsewhere
[1,39,40] and is not discussed in this article. The pivotal role
of VEGF-A in embryonic vascular development was demon￾strated by the remarkable discovery that targeted inactiva￾tion of a single VEGF-A allele in mice caused a lethal
impairment of angiogenesis, resulting in death between E11
and E12 [41,42]. The importance of larger VEGF-A isoforms,
including VEGF-A165, was confirmed by the finding that
mice expressing only VEGF-A120 - and lacking the longer
heparin-binding isoforms - die within 2 weeks of birth owing
to haemorrhage and ischemic cardiomyopathy (heart failure
due to lack of blood supply to the heart muscle) [43]. A car￾diomyocyte-specific VEGF-A gene knockout generated using
Cre-lox technology results in reduced body weight and thin￾walled, dilated, poorly vascularized hearts [1].
Studies involving inducible VEGF-A gene inactivation or
administration of soluble (s) forms of the receptor Flt-1 to
inhibit VEGF-A function have established that VEGF-A con￾tinues to be critically important during post-natal growth
and organ development [1]. Inducible Cre-lox-mediated dis￾ruption of the VEGF-A gene in early post-natal life causes
increased mortality, reduced body growth, and impaired
organ development, particularly of the liver. Inhibition of
VEGF-A by treatment of mice with sFlt-1 between 1 and 8
days after birth results in a more severe effect, characterized
by growth arrest and lethality, but the effect of VEGF-A inhi￾bition became less drastic if initiated at progressively later
times in post-natal life. Inhibition of VEGF-A with sFlt-1
shows that VEGF-A-driven vascularization is also essential
for endochondral bone formation and development of the
corpus luteum during pregnancy [1].
VEGF-A-driven angiogenesis has a major role in the patho￾genesis of diverse human diseases, including cancer, eye dis￾orders and rheumatoid arthritis [44]. Recognition of the
importance of VEGF-A for the development of several
important classes of cancer recently culminated in the
approval of Avastin, a humanized monoclonal antibody to
VEGF-A, for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer
[45]. There has also been great interest in using VEGF-A for
the treatment of ischemic heart disease, where the aim is to
promote blood-vessel formation and thereby provide a ‘bio￾logical bypass’ for diseased arteries. Despite abundant pre￾clinical data suggesting that VEGF-A protein or gene therapy
could be effective in treating ischemic heart disease, clinical
trials have not so far yielded definitive evidence in support of
this approach [1].
VEGF-A was originally identified as vascular permeability
factor (VPF) as a result of its potent ability to increase vascu￾lar permeability, resulting in leakage of proteins and other
molecules out of blood vessels [2,34]. The physiological sig￾nificance of the permeability-increasing effect of VEGF-A
remains unclear, but it is important in mediating some path￾ogenic consequences of VEGF-A overexpression in disease,
an example being brain edema (swelling and build-up of
fluid) following cerebral ischemia [1].
In addition to its major role in angiogenesis, VEGF-A prob￾ably has functions that are independent of both endothelial
cells and blood-vessel formation. A growing body of evi￾dence indicates that VEGF-A has neurotrophic and neuro￾protective activities in vitro and in vivo [46,47]. It has also
been implicated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), an
incurable degenerative disorder of motor neurons. Reduced
VEGF-A expression resulting from deletion of the HRE
from the VEGF-A promoter predisposes mice to ALS-like
motor-neuron degeneration, and mice can be protected
against ALS by treatment with VEGF-A [48]. Furthermore,
humans with particular VEGF-A promoter haplotypes have
an increased risk of ALS associated with lower circulating
levels of VEGF-A [49].
The VEGFR1-specific ligand, PLGF-1, appears to be weakly
angiogenic when acting alone, but VEGF-A-PLGF het￾erodimers can bind to VEGFR2, are mitogenic for endothe￾lial cells, and stimulate angiogenesis in vivo [50]. Though
mice lacking PLGF are viable and develop normally, they
have reduced angiogenesis in pathophysiological situations
such as ischemia. PLGF-deficient mice also have delayed col￾lateral artery growth following blockage of an artery, and
PLGF stimulates collateral vessel growth. PLGF stimulates
monocyte chemotaxis through VEGFR1, and there is
increasing evidence that the biological effects of PLGF are
mediated by mobilization of bone-marrow-derived
haematopoietic progenitors.
A biological role for VEGF-B has not yet been clearly estab￾lished. VEGF-B knockout mice are viable, healthy and
fertile, but whereas Bellomo et al. [51] reported that VEGF￾B-null mice have smaller hearts and recover more slowly
from cardiac ischemia than wild-type littermates, Aase et al.
[52] observed no effect of loss of VEGF-B on cardiac size or
development and instead found a specific defect in atrial
conduction in the adult. VEGF-B-deficient mice also have
impaired development of pathophysiology when arthritis or
hypoxic pulmonary hypertension are experimentally
induced [53].

VEGF-C and its receptor, VEGFR3 (Flt-4), are strongly
implicated in the formation of the lymphatic endothelium
(lymphangiogenesis). Transgenic mice overexpressing
VEGF-C in keratinocytes of the skin epidermis develop
enlarged lymphatic vessels, while mice overexpressing
VEGF-A164 in the same location show only blood-vessel
hyperplasia [54]. VEGF-C also stimulates angiogenesis in
the mouse cornea [55], however, and also in rabbit models of
ischemia in the hindlimb. VEGF-D is mitogenic in endothe￾lial cells and promotes angiogenesis in vitro and in several
models of angiogenesis in vivo [56]. VEGF-D also stimulates
lymphangiogenesis in mice when overexpressed in skin ker￾atinocytes and tumors [57], and it induces the survival and
migration of lymphatic endothelial cells.
The viral VEGF-Es encoded by different strains of the para￾poxvirus Orf appear to be important for viral infection and
its associated pathology. Viruses of the Orf genus cause a
contagious pustular dermatitis in sheep and goats, which is
transmissible to humans, and produces lesions characterized
by extensive neovascularization, vascular dilation, and epi￾dermal proliferation. VEGF-E(NZ2) induces dermal vascular￾ization and epidermal proliferation in sheep, and disruption
of the VEGF-E(NZ2) gene resulted in a marked decrease in the
vascularization of viral lesions without impairing viral repli￾cation in the early stages of infection [58].
Drosophila PVFs and their receptor, PVR, have key roles in
cell migration during two developmental processes [14-16].
Firstly, PVR is expressed by the border cells, a cluster of
somatic follicle cells that migrate towards the oocyte during
oogenesis; PVF1 is produced by oocytes and acts as a guid￾ance cue for the PVR-expressing border cells during their
migration [14]. Secondly, though devoid of endothelial cells
or blood vessels, Drosophila does possess blood cells or
hemocytes, and the PVF/PVR system is involved in the
migration of these cells. PVR is expressed in the developing
hemocytes during Drosophila embryogenesis, whereas
PVF1, PVF2 and PVF3 are expressed along the hemocyte
migratory route; inactivating mutations in either PVR or all
three PVFs arrests hemocyte movement [16]. 
In C. elegans, which lacks a vascular system, the VEGFR-like
VER proteins are localized to cells of neural origin, suggest￾ing a role in neurogenesis [17]. The recently identified VEGF
and VEGFR homologs in the jellyfish P. carnea [18] are
expressed in tubular structures of the gastrovascular system
and in the endoderm during development at the stage when
undifferentiated cells migrate and differentiate into plate
cells. In this process, the differentiating plate cells interact
with matrix and smooth muscle cells, a process analogous to
the interaction of endothelial and vascular smooth muscle
cells in angiogenesis. As nematodes and jellyfish lack both a
vascular circulatory system and blood cells, the discovery of
VEGF and VEGFR-like molecules in these species suggests
that these proteins performed primordial functions in tubu￾logenesis and neurogenesis at an early evolutionary stage
and only later developed more specialized roles in
hematopoiesis and vascular development in more complex
organisms. The role of VEGFs and VEGFRs in cell migration
appears to be fundamental to their biological functions in
invertebrate and vertebrate species.
Frontiers
Although significant progress has been made towards eluci￾dating the mechanisms mediating the angiogenic effects of
VEGF-A, several formidable challenges lie ahead. The bio￾logical and signaling roles of the VEGF receptors, particu￾larly VEGFR1 and neuropilin-1, have not yet been fully
defined. Another key goal is the identification of the mecha￾nisms underlying the role of VEGF-A in endothelial cell dif￾ferentiation and early vascular development. An emergent
area of interest is the study of VEGF and VEGFR homologs
in invertebrates. A better understanding of how VEGF
ligand-receptor systems function in Drosophila and C.
elegans will shed light on the ancestral function of this
family of molecules and may also generate novel insights
into their biological roles in vertebrates. Another major goal
in the future will be to clarify the distinct biological functions
of different members of the VEGF family.
A key area of ongoing research will be the role of VEGFs in
human disease. As recent work on ALS demonstrates
[48,49], it is likely that new insights into the importance of
VEGFs for disease will continue to be generated. Conse￾quently, the scope for using anti-VEGF approaches thera￾peutically will grow, and the challenge will be to develop
more effective and economic ways to prevent VEGF-driven
pathophysiological angiogenesis or to correct VEGF deficits.
The future use of VEGF therapy for cardiovascular disease
remains an enticing prospect but awaits confirmatory data
from clinical studies.
