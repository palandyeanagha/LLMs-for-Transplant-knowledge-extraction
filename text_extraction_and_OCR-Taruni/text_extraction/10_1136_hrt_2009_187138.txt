ABSTRACT
Background Idiopathic recurrent acute pericarditis
(IRAP) is a rare disease of suspected, yet unproved,
immune-mediated origin. The finding of serum heart￾specific autoantibodies in IRAP would strengthen the
autoimmune hypothesis and provide aetiology-specific
non-invasive biomarkers.
Objective To assess frequency of serum anti-heart
(AHA), anti-intercalated-disk (AIDA) and non-cardiac￾specific autoantibodies and their clinical and instrumental
correlates in patients with IRAP.
Patients 40 consecutive patients with IRAP, 25 male,
aged 37616 years, representing a large single-centre
cohort collected at a referral centre over a long time
period (median 5 years, range 1e22 years). Control
groups included patients with non-inflammatory cardiac
disease (NICD) (n¼160), ischaemic heart failure
(n¼141) and normal subjects (n¼270).
Methods AHA (organ-specific, cross-reactive 1 and 2
types) and AIDA were detected in serum samples from
patients, at last follow-up, and control subjects by indirect
immunofluorescence (IIF) on human myocardium and
skeletal muscle. Non-cardiac-specific autoantibodies were
detected by IIF, and anti-Ro/SSA, anti-La/SSB by ELISA.
Results The frequencies of cross-reactive 1 AHA and of
AIDA were higher (50%; 25%) in IRAP than in NICD (4%;
4%), ischaemic (1%; 2%) or normal subjects (3%; 0%)
(p¼0.0001). AHA and/or AIDA were found in 67.5%
patients with IRAP. Of the non-cardiac-specific
antibodies, only antinuclear autoantibodies at titre $1/
160 were more common in IRAP (5%) versus normal
(0.5%, p<0.04). AIDA in IRAP were associated with
a higher number of recurrences (p¼0.01) and
hospitalisations (p¼0.0001), high titre (1/80 or higher)
AHA with a higher number of recurrences (p¼0.02).
Conclusions The detection of AHA and of AIDA
supports the involvement of autoimmunity in the majority
of patients with IRAP.
INTRODUCTION
Pericarditis may account for about 5% of presen￾tations to emergency departments for non￾ischaemic chest pain.1 Recurrences occur in up to
15e32% of patients.2e7 Recurrent acute pericarditis
is generally idiopathic or post-cardiac injury, and is
often a frustrating problem, for both patients and
doctors.2e7 Idiopathic recurrent acute pericarditis
(IRAP) is a disease of suspected, yet unproved,
immune-mediated pathogenesis.8e11
Patients with autoimmune conditions have
a high frequency of circulating autoantibodies to
the diseased target organ as well as other unaffected
tissues.12 Serum anti-heart (AHA) and anti-inter￾calated disk autoantibodies (AIDA) detected by
indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) represent auto￾immune markers in patients with biopsy-proven
myocarditis, dilated cardiomyopathy and in their
relatives.13e18 We assessed the frequency of AHA,
AIDA and of other non-cardiac-specific autoanti￾bodies in a consecutive Italian series of patients
with IRAP, as potential autoimmune markers.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patients and inclusion criteria
Sixty-three consecutive patients with recurrent
acute pericarditis who fulfilled the inclusion criteria
were assessed. Patients were included if they
presented with a first attack of acute pericarditis
defined by all the following features: typical chest
pain (with or without a pericardial friction rub),
suggestive electrocardiographic (ECG) changes,
pericardial effusion, normal creatine kinase-MB and
increased C-reactive protein.10 19 The minimum
criteria for diagnosis of recurrences were the
combination of typical chest pain, increased
C-reactive protein, ECG and/or echocardiographic
alterations. C-reactive protein had to be elevated in
all cases during an acute attack.10 19 Only two
patients were lost to follow-up; 13 patients had
a post-cardiac injury syndrome; in five patients,
initially labelled as ‘idiopathic’, a diagnosis of
rheumatoid arthritis in one case and of Sjögren
syndrome in four patients was made. In 43 patients
the pericarditis remained ‘idiopathic’ at the end of
a very long follow-up (mean 8.3 years, range
2e43 years); serum at last follow-up was available
in 40 of them for autoantibody testing; these 40
patients are included in this study (25 men, aged at
onset 37616, range 13e67 years).
We used a previously detailed multidrug treatment
protocol: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs at
high dosages (indometacin 75e150 mg, or aspirin
1500e2400 mg, or ibuprofen 1200e1800 mg/day);
a very slow tapering of the corticosteroid if a steroid
had already been started; colchicine (0.5e1 mg/day)
if tolerated; immunosuppressive agents in selected
cases.10 19 20
AHA and AIDA testing by standard indirect
immunofluorescence
Serum samples from patients with pericarditis,
taken at the last follow-up evaluation, were tested
for AHA and AIDA by IIF at 1/10 dilution on 4 mm
thick unfixed fresh frozen cryostat sections of blood

group O normal human atrium and skeletal muscle; AHA- and
AIDA-positive sera were subsequently titrated to end point by
double dilutions.13e17 Organ-specific and cross-reactive 1 AHA
patterns were classified as described.13e17
Briefly, organ-specific AHA gave diffuse cytoplasmic staining of
atrial myocytes, but were negative on skeletal muscle; cross￾reactive 1 or partially organ-specific AHA gave a fine striational
staining on atrium, but were negative or only weakly stained
skeletal muscle; cross-reactive 2 AHA gave a broad striational
pattern on longitudinal sections of heart and skeletal muscle.13e17
Absorption studies with relevant tissues had confirmed the organ￾specificity and cross-reactivity of the AHA patterns.13
AIDA gave a linear staining of the intercalated disks between
cardiac myocytes (figure 1). Two serum samples were used as
standard positive and negative controls and titrated in every
assay. All sera were read blindly against these standards using
a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss Axioplan 2 imaging; Zeiss, New
York, USA). An additional positive control serum was titrated to
assess reproducibility. Endpoint titres for this serum were
reproducible within one double dilution in all assays.14e17 The
frequency of AHA and of AIDA in pericarditis was compared
with that observed in our established control groups of subjects
with non-inflammatory cardiac disease (n¼160, 80 male, aged
37617 years, of whom n¼55 had rheumatic heart disease, n¼67
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, n¼38 congenital defects),
ischaemic heart disease (n¼141, 131 male, aged 44614 years)
and normal subjects (n¼270, 123 male, age 35611).14e17 Forty￾one of the 141 ischaemic patients, aged 47612 years, 28 male; 31
in New York Heart Association (NYHA) III and 10 in NYHA IV,
had had a myocardial infarct 6 months to 10 years (median
2 years) previously; ejection fraction ranged from 16% to 44%
(mean 3067).14e17
Non-cardiac-specific autoantibody tests
Antinuclear antibodies were tested by IIF on HEp2 cells and
anti-mitochondrial antibodies by IIF on rat liver and kidney.
Other non-cardiac-specific autoantibodies, including anti￾thyroid, anti-gastric parietal cell, anti-islet cell, and anti-adrenal
cell were tested by IIF on rat thyroid gland, rat stomach, human
pancreas, human adrenal gland, respectively. For all these anti￾bodies, 375 healthy subjects, 211 male and 164 female, aged
38612 years were considered as controls.
Anti-Ro/SSA (52 kDa and 60 kDa) and anti-La/SSB antibodies
were tested using a commercially available ELISA (INOVA
Diagnostics, San Diego, California, USA); controls included 75
subjects, 46 male, aged 3763.

Statistical analysis
Results for quantitative features are given as means 6 SD.
Student t test, one-way analysis of variance, c2 (with Yates’s
correction) or Fisher’s exact test was used as appropriate. All p
values were two tailed; p values <0.05 were considered to
indicate statistical significance. All antibodies were tested in the
same sample (eg, at the same time point). All statistical analyses
were performed using the StatView software version 5.0 for
Apple Macintosh (SAS Institute).
RESULTS
Clinical and diagnostic features in patients with IRAP
Main clinical and diagnostic features of the patients with IRAP
are detailed in table 1. At the time of last follow-up, when serum
was taken for the immunological antibody tests, 21 (52%) were
still receiving treatment as detailed in table 1, all but one were in
NYHA class I, one was mildly symptomatic (class II), with
a normal echocardiographic left ventricular ejection fraction.
Frequency of AHA, AIDA and other autoantibodies in IRAP
The frequency and AHA of IgG class in IRAP and controls is
shown in table 2. Representative examples of AHA and AIDA
patterns are shown in figure 1. The frequencies of cross-reactive
1 AHA and AIDA were higher in IRAP than in control subjects
(p¼0.0001). Conversely, the frequencies of cross-reactive 2 and
organ-specific AHA were similar in IRAP, and control subjects
respectively (p¼NS). AHA of any type and/or AIDA were found
in 27 (67.5%) patients with pericarditis; AHA of the cross￾reactive 1 type and/or AIDA were found in 22 (55%). AHA titres
among the 25 antibody positive sera were as follows: 1/10 in
eight (32%), 1/40 in 10 (40%), $1/80 in seven (28%). AIDA titres
among the 10 antibody-positive sera were as follows: 1/10 in six
(60%), 1/40 in three (30%) and 1/80 in 1 (10%).
The frequency of other autoantibodies in the study groups is
shown in table 3. The frequency of positive (titre $1/160) anti￾nuclear antibody was higher in pericarditis than in normal
subjects (p<0.04). Other non-cardiac-specific antibodies were all
negative in IRAP, but two were parietal cell antibody positive and
one anti-Ro/SSA positive. The patient who was anti-Ro/SSA
positive did not have Sjögren syndrome. None of the patients with
IRAP with non-cardiac-specific antibodies had co-occurring
autoimmune conditions. Overall 27 (67.5%) patients with IRAP
were positive for AHA, AIDA and/or other autoantibodies.
Clinical correlates of AHA, AIDA and other autoantibodies in
IRAP
Comparison of clinical and diagnostic features in relation to
AHA and AIDA status is shown in tables 4e6. There were no
differences between patients with AHA and those without
(table 4). AHA-positive patients tended to be more frequently
receiving combined drug treatment at last follow-up compared
with those without (p¼0.07). Conversely, patients with high
titre ($1/80) AHA had longer symptom duration (p¼0.006),
higher number of recurrences (p¼0.02), higher end-diastolic
posterior wall thickness (p¼0.02) and tended to have longer
follow-up (p¼0.06) and more frequent treatment with
combined treatment at the last follow-up (p¼0.08) compared
with those with low-titre (<1/80) or negative AHA (table 5).
AIDA-positive patients had a higher number of recurrences
(p¼0.01) and of hospitalisations (p¼0.0001); AIDA-positive
status tended to be more common among patients with
refractory symptoms, treated at some stage during follow-up
with immunosuppressive drugs and/or pericardiocentesis or
pericardiectomy (p¼0.05) (table 6). Sensitivities, specificities,
positive and negative predictive values for the various AHA and
AIDA patterns in IRAP are shown in table 7.

subjects, in keeping with autoimmune involvement in at least
55% of patients. Cross-reactive 1 AHA, which are increased in
IRAP, have partial cardiac specificity and are also more
frequently found in myocarditis or dilated cardiomyopathy than
in controls.13e18 Since true IRAP is a rare disease, the series
reported here is the largest single-centre cohort collected at
a referral centre during a long period and the first to undergo
immunological screening for cardiac autoimmunity. Other
previously recognised autoimmune features in IRAP12 include its
chronic/recurrent course; detection of proinflammatory cyto￾kines in the pericardial fluid but not in plasma, suggesting a local
inflammatory reaction8
; familial aggregation and a weak asso￾ciation with the HLA-B14 and DRB1*01 alleles that have been
associated with other immune-mediated conditions9 21; and
efficacy of anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive
treatments.9e11 20e23
In this study positive AIDA status was associated with a high
number of relapses, hospitalisations and refractory symptoms,
suggesting higher immune activation during the “hot” phases of
pericardial inflammation. In addition, higher AHA titres were
associated with longer symptom duration and high number of
recurrences. These findings further reinforce the autoimmune
hypothesis in IRAP. Cross-reactive 1 AHA and AIDA frequency
was high in spite of a long duration of symptoms and in some
instances of immunosuppressive treatment. However, most
immunosuppressive drugs do not lower autoantibody titres.24 In
keeping with this, we have recently reported that positive AHA
status is an independent predictor of high rejection burden in
patients with a longstanding heart transplant receiving chronic
dual or triple immunosuppressive regimens comparable to those
used in IRAP.25
Surprisingly, the frequency of organ-specific AHA was similar
in patients with IRAP and in controls, whereas in biopsy-proven
myocarditis and in dilated cardiomyopathy, organ-specific AHA
frequency is increased compared with control groups.13e18 There
are possible explanations for the discrepancy. First, in autoim￾mune disease, different antibody specificities are associated with
distinct clinical phenotypes12; thus cross-reactive 1 AHA may be
more prevalent in pericarditis, organ-specific AHA in
myocarditis. This view is supported by earlier reports of serum
cross-reactive AHA in other forms of suspected immune-medi￾ated pericarditisdfor example, the post-pericardiotomy
syndrome or the Dressler syndrome.26 27 Second, in autoimmune
disease some autoantibodies are detected earlier in the disease
course and others in advanced phases and/or during relapses.28
Longitudinal studies in IRAP should clarify the temporal
sequence of appearance of each autoantibody specificity; it may
be that organ-specific AHA are early markers, followed by AIDA
and cross-reactive AHA in advanced IRAP. This would mirror
the temporal sequence observed in patients with dilated
cardiomyopathy, where organ-specific AHA are early markers
that become undetectable in advanced disease.13e15 29
Three of the autoantigens recognised by the AHA detected by
IIF in dilated cardiomyopathy were identified by us as a and
b myosin heavy chain and myosin light chain-1v isoforms by
western blotting30 and confirmed by others.31 32 It is highly
likely that the same autoantigens are also responsible for AHA
and AIDA found in IRAP, since AHA and AIDA in IRAP
(figure 1) and in biopsy-proven myocarditis with or without
concurrent pericarditis16 or in dilated cardiomyopathy sera13 14 17
exhibit the same localisation patterns by IIF. The autoantigen(s)
responsible for AIDA have not yet been identified, but there are
many candidates.33 So far this is the first study showing increased
AHA and AIDA in IRAP. Small variable amounts of sera were

available. This prevented us from further testing for autoantigen
specificity.We aim at identifying additional autoantigens in newly
diagnosed patients; in keeping with other autoimmune diseases,
autoantigens involved in early disease stages are more closely
related to primary pathogenetic mechanisms and are more likely
to be pathogenetically relevant than those which have a role in
secondary immunopathogenesis.12 The search for additional
antibodies should be extended using pericardial substrate, though
it is cumbersome to obtain normal pericardial tissue for analysis.
For this reason it is presently unknown whether AHA and AIDA
cross react with pericardial tissue.
So far, evidence for a direct pathogenic role of the AHA and
AIDA detected by IIF in patients with myocarditis or dilated
cardiomyopathy is lacking.13e17 34 However, animal data as well
as in vitro and early clinical observations suggest that some of
the antibodies (eg, anti-b1 adrenergic receptors, anti-myosin,
anti-troponin) detected by other immunological techniques may
have a functional role in a patient subset.34e46 Further work is
needed to clarify this issue in IRAP, although the lack of clinical
and echocardiographic evidence of ventricular dysfunction in our
patients at the time of serum testing argues against a direct
pathogenic role of AHA or AIDA.
Study limitations
It is not known if myocarditis was associated with pericarditis
in our patients. None of the patients had echocardiographic
findings suggestive of myocardial involvement (regional or
global wall motion abnormalities, increased wall thickness) or
increased creatine kinase-MB,47 but endomyocardial biopsy was
not performed. Since the diagnosis of myocarditis is based on
endomyocardial biopsy, myocarditis cannot be theoretically
excluded.48 49 However, typical acute pericarditis findings as
those described in this study for the first episode were
uncommon in our recent large prospective series of biopsy￾proven myocarditis.16 In addition, biopsy-proven myocarditis
leads to death or heart transplantation in 27% of patients at
6 years16; conversely, IRAP has a benign prognosis, as confirmed
in the present cohort with a long follow-up.19 In support of our
conservative approach, none of the patients with IRAP described
here presented with one of the clinical scenarios (eg, heart failure
or life-threatening arrhythmia) that warrant endomyocardial
biopsy according to the recent guidelines.50 Our hypothesis, in
keeping with previous observations,5 7 is that myocarditis is
unlikely to be present in IRAP.
Current guidelines suggest that the diagnosis of autoimmune
pericarditis should be based upon pericardial/epicardial biopsy
findings.6 A limitation of our study is that pericardial biopsy was
not performed. However, experts advocate that once collagen
vascular disease, previous cardiac surgery or myocardial infarc￾tion are ruled out, as for our patients, relapsing pericarditis is
almost invariably immune-mediated with or without a viral
trigger.457 Pericardial biopsy is not widely used.457 Last but not
least IRAP has a benign prognosis, as reported1 19 45 and
confirmed here, thus an invasive approach may not be justified,
at least in the majority of patients.457
CONCLUSION
The high prevalence of AHA and AIDA shown here strongly
suggests that IRAP is an autoimmune disease in a large subset of
patients. Whether or not these autoantibodies may provide
clinically useful biomarkers of pericarditis relapses and/or non￾invasive tools to tailor immunosuppressive treatment warrants
