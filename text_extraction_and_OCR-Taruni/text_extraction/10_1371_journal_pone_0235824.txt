Abstract
Pulmonary hypertension due to left heart disease (PH-LHD) is a momentous pulmonary
hypertension disease, and left heart disease is the most familiar cause. Mechanical stretch￾ing may be a crucial cause of vascular remodeling. While, the underlining mechanism of
mechanical stretching-induced in remodeling of pulmonary vein in the early stage of PH￾LHD has not been completely elucidated. In our study, the PH-LHD model rats were suc￾cessfully constructed. After 25 days, doppler echocardiography and hemodynamic exami￾nation were performed. In addition, after treatment, the levels of matrix metalloproteinase-9
(MMP-9) and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) were determined by ELISA, immuno￾histochemistry and western blot assays in the pulmonary veins. Moreover, the pathological
change of pulmonary tissues was evaluated by H&E staining. Our results uncovered that
left ventricular insufficiency and interventricular septal shift could be observed in PH-LHD
model rats, and the right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) and mean left atrial pressure
(mLAP) were also elevated in PH-LHD model rats. Meanwhile, we found that MMP-9 and
TGF-β1 could be highly expressed in PH-LHD model rats. Besides, we revealed that
stretch-activated channel (SAC)/mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) signaling path￾way could be involved in the upregulations of MMP-9 and TGF-β1 mediated by mechanical
stretching in pulmonary vein. Therefore, current research revealed that mechanical stretch￾ing induced the increasing expressions of MMP-9 and TGF-β1 in pulmonary vein, which
could be mediated by activation of SAC/MAPKs signaling pathway in the early stage of PH￾LHD.

Introduction
Pulmonary hypertension due to left heart disease (PH-LHD) belongs to type II pulmonary
hypertension (PH) and is the most common type of PH in clinical practice [1, 2]. It is usually
initiated by left ventricular dysfunction, which results in increased left ventricular end-dia￾stolic pressure, increased left atrial pressure, and finally increased pulmonary venous pressure.
This eventually leads to PH and pulmonary artery revascularization [1, 3]. Thus pulmonary
vascular remodeling is the pathological basis of PH-LHD [4]. Study has demonstrated that the
earliest pathophysiological change occurs in the pulmonary veins during the disease process of
PH-LHD [5]. Whether pulmonary venous hypertension in the early stage of the disease partic￾ipates in pulmonary artery remodeling has not been reported.
Cell adhesion, spreading, growth and differentiation can be regulated by various physical
and chemical factors, among which mechanical factors have a great influence on these biologi￾cal behaviors of cells [6, 7]. Previous studies have indicated that the stretch of cell membrane
and its surface receptors can cause the changes of cell morphology and nuclear position, thus
affecting cell growth [8, 9]. Research has also testified that cell morphology and spreading
degree can affect gene expression and even determine cell survival and death [10, 11]. Cur￾rently, Mechanical stretching has become a crucial factor in regulating the structure and func￾tion of mammalian cells and tissues, but excessive mechanical stretching will cause vascular
remodeling [12]. Nevertheless, the functions and mechanisms of mechanical stretching on
PH-LHD has not been entirely elucidated.
Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), also known as gelatinase-B, is one of the most crucial
members of the MMPs family [13]. Long-term hypertension can lead to vascular endothelial
damage and stimulate smooth muscle to produce MMP-9 [14]. MMP-9 can also degrade the
vascular extracellular matrix (ECM), damage the vessel wall and lead to vascular remodeling
[15]. Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), as a pleiotropic factor, is the most dominant
subtype of TGF-β [16, 17]. TGF-β1 has been proven to protect the aorta and other blood ves￾sels from damage caused by factors such as high blood pressure and high cholesterol [18, 19].
Researches have shown that MMP-9 and TGF-β1 play vital roles in pulmonary vascular
remodeling [14, 20, 21]. Study showed that the enhanced TGF-β-driven smad-2/3 signaling
promoted pulmonary vascular remodeling in inflaming lungs [22]. Study proved that the
increased activity and expression of MMP-9 in Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH),
and effective blocking of MMP-9 could provide an option in the therapeutic intervention of
human PAH [23].
SAC, serves a mechanically-sensitive ion channel, can be regulated by the changes in the
tension of a cellular scaffold or lipid membrane coupled with channel proteins [24]. It was
reported that SAC has significant effect in the electrophysiological changes of the myocardium
during stimulation [25]. MAPK pathway is proven to be involved in various physiological pro￾cesses, such as cell growth, development and inter-cell function synchronization, which also
can be closely related to the regulation of inflammation and stress response [26, 27]. Studies
also testified that mechanical stretching can activate the phosphorylation of the MAPK path￾way [28, 29]. Also, studies have shown that the expression of MMP-9 and TGF-β1 in tissues
may be related to stretch-activated channel (SAC) and mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK) signaling pathway [12, 30, 31]. Therefore, we speculated that SAC and MAPK signal￾ing pathway may be potential regulatory molecules in PH-LHD.
In this study, the isolated pulmonary veins of PH-LHD rats were mechanically stretched
and the expression of MMP-9 and TGF-β1 that corresponded to the early stage of the dis￾ease was evaluated. Also, the roles of SAC and MAPK signaling pathway on the expression
of MMP-9 and TGF-β1 were explored to investigate the possible mechanism of pulmonary

vascular remodeling. The study may shed new light on the prevention and treatment of
PH-LHD.
Materials and methods
Animals
Male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats (3–4 weeks old and weighing 80–100 g; license number SCXK
(Hu) 2017–0005) were provided by the Shanghai Slack Laboratory Animal Co. (Shanghai,
China). Before the experiment, all rats were kept adaptively for one week, fed a standard diet
and fed free water. All rats in this study have been approved by the ethics committee of Fujian
Medical University. All animal experiments were in compliance with the Guide for the Care
and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the US National Institutes of Health and the Ani￾mal Care and Use committees of Fujian Medical University (NO. FJMU IACUC 2018–067).
Establishment of PH-LHD model
PH-LHD model was established by banding procedure described by Siegfried Breitling [32].
Banding is a coarctation procedure used for the ascending aorta above the coronary artery.
It is an ideal method to establish model for congestive heart failure and pulmonary arterial
hypertension caused by left heart disease [32–34]. It is widely used in experimental research of
PH [35–38]. The rats were intraperitoneally injected with 2% sodium pentobarbital (0.3 ml/
100 g) and subject to non-invasive nasal mask ventilation. The thorax was opened at the sec￾ond intercostal space on the left side of the sternum to expose the ascending aorta. The metal
titanium clip (Hemoclip1; Weck Closure System, Research Triangle Park, NC) with a preset
internal diameter of 0.8 mm was used to clamp the ascending aorta. During the first three days
after surgery, subcutaneous injection of Carprofen (4 mg/kg bw; Rimadyl TM, Pfizer Gmb H,
Karslruhe, Germany) was given daily for postoperative analgesia. The rats in the sham group
also underwent operation to expose the ascending aorta. But the ascending aorta was not
clamped. The remaining postoperative treatment was the same as in the model group. When
the rats reached the humane end, they were euthanized through decapitation.
Mechanical strength
The isolated vascular tone tester 620M bath (Danish Myo Technology A/S, Denmark) was pre￾heated to 37˚C with 8 ml of K-H solution. Pulmonary vein ring was hanged on the stainless
steel hook and adjusted to zero calibration. The K-H solution was changed every 15 minutes
during the experiment and a continuous mixture of 95% O2 and 5% CO2 were provided. the
vessel rings were first kept in K-H solution for 60 minutes. And then a mechanical strength of
2.0 g was applied for 60 minutes, while in the S1 and M1 groups no mechanical strength was
applied. Finally, the above treated pulmonary vein rings were collected and stored in a -80˚C
freezer.
Group of experiments
A total of 48 SD rats were randomly divided into the sham group (n = 12) and the PH-LHD
group (n = 36). Corresponding to different inhibitors and mechanical strength used to treat
pulmonary venous rings, the sham group was further divided into two subgroups: Sham 1 (S1,
mechanical strength: 0 g) and Sham 2 (S2, mechanical strength: 2.0 g); and the PH-LHD group
was also further divided into 2 subgroups: Model 1 (M1, banding+0 g), Model 2 (M2, banding
+2.0 g). In addition, a broad spectrum inhibitor of MEK1 and MEK2 (U0126, HY-12031 Med￾Chem Express, USA), p38 MAPK inhibitor (SB203580, HY-10256 MedChem Express, USA),

SAC inhibitor (Streptomycin, HY-B0472 MedChem Express, USA) and broad-spectrum
inhibitor of JNK1, JNK2, and JNK3 (SP600125, HY-12041 MedChem Express, USA) were dis￾solved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, HY-10999 MedChem Express, USA), and diluted with
K-H solution to 250 μmol/L, 200 μmol/L, 1000 μmol/L, and 250 μmol/L, respectively [12].
Specifically, the pulmonary veins were immersed in the K-H solution containing the corre￾sponding inhibitors (SB203580, SP600125, U0126 or Streptomycin) at 37˚C under the condi￾tion of continuous oxygen infusion for 60 mins, and then was stretched with 2.0 g mechanical
strength for 60 mins.
Doppler echocardiography
On day 25 after surgery, Doppler echocardiography was performed to confirm that the metal
titanium clip did not fall off or displaced. The diameter of the pulmonary artery and the right
ventricular end-diastolic diameter were measured and the left cardiac function was evaluated.
Right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) was monitored with a right heart catheter (RHC),
mean left atrial pressure (mLAP) was monitored directly, and data was collected by BL-420S
experimental system of biological function (Chengdu Taimen Software Co., Ltd). PH-LHD
was confirmed by left heart failure and increased RVSP.
Sample preparation
On day 25, all rats were anesthetized with 2% pentobarbital sodium (ip., 0.3 ml/100 g) after
Doppler echocardiography and hemodynamic examination. The blood of inferior vena cava
was collected and centrifuged (2000 ×g, at 4˚C for 5 mins), and then the collected serum was
stored in the refrigerator at -80˚C. The chest was opened in the middle to confirm that the
metal titanium clip was on the ascending aorta. The prepared PBS at 4˚C was slowly injected
from the right ventricle, and then to the left atrium through the pulmonary circulation; and
then the remaining blood in the rat pulmonary circulation was discharged until the pulmonary
lobe became white. The heart was quickly separated, dried and weighed. Besides, the pulmo￾nary vein, pulmonary artery, and lung tissue were removed, and the pulmonary vein was
placed in a Krebs-Henseleit solution (118 mmol/L NaCl, 4.70 mmol/L KCl, 1.20 mmol/L
MgSO4, 25.00 mmol/L NaHCO3, 1.20 mmol/L KH2PO4, 11.0 mmol/L glucose, 0.50 mmol/L
EDTA-Na2, and 2.50 mmol/L CaCl2) at 4˚C. The peripheral tissues of the pulmonary veins
were removed under a microscope and 4-mm pulmonary venous rings were prepared (S1 Fig).
Pulmonary artery, pulmonary vein and peripheral lung tissues were collected and stored in a
-80˚C freezer. Moreover, the pulmonary lobes were removed and immobilized in 4% parafor￾maldehyde for 24 h and transferred to 75% alcohol.
Western blotting analysis
For measuring the levels of MMP-9 and TGF-β1, tissues were fully ground into homogenate
with RIPA buffer and protease inhibitor (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, China) and
centrifuged for 20 min at 12000 rpm at 4˚C. The supernatant was collected and the protein
concentration was measured using a BCA protein assay Kit (Beijing Solarbio Science & Tech￾nology Co., Ltd. China). Protein samples (40 μg for each) were separated by SDS-PAGE and
then transferred onto the PVDF membranes. After being blocked in 5% BSA in TBS buffer
for 2.0 hrs, the membranes were incubated with the primary antibodies (MMP-9 or TGF-β1,
1:1000, rabbit polyclonal antibody, Abcam) overnight at 4˚C. After washing 3 times with 1×
TBST, the membranes were incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:5000, Affinity) for 1.0
hours at room temperature. The specific bands were developed after washing 3 times by

1 × TBST. Finally, the bands were visualized by ChemiDoc Imaging Systems, and the intensity
of protein bands were quantified using Image J software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA).
ELISA assay
Immediately after removal on day 25, venous blood samples were centrifuged for 20 min
(1200 revolutions/ min [rpm], 4˚C), and serum was stored at –20˚C until analysis. Serum
MMP-9 and TGF-β1 levels were determined with a commercial immunoassay kit specifc to rat
MMP-9 and TGF-β1 (Neobioscience, Inc., CN) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. This
kit is a highly sensitive two-site enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for measuring
MMP-9 and TGF-β1. All experiments were performed in triplicate.
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay
The lung tissues were dipped into 10% Formalin solution for 24 h. The monoclonal antibody
against MMP-9 or TGF-β1 (1:200, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) and the goat anti-rabbit￾IgG (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) were used for immunostaining. Negative and positive
controls were used for both staining procedures.
Hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining
The lung tissues were dehydrated in ethanol solution, and transparentized in dimethylben￾zene. After paraffin embedding, tissues were cut into slices. Then slices were roasted, dewaxed
and hydrated, incubated in hematoxylin solution, cultured in alcohol and hydrochloric acid
and cultured in Scott blue buffer. Finally, they were dehydrated, transparentized, mounted,
and observed under a microscope (CKX41, Olympus, Japan). Each tissue of model group and
sham group photographed with 200-fold and 400-fold field of view.
Statistical analysis
The data were expressed as mean ± Standard Error of Mean (mean±SEM), and the unpaired
t-student tests or one-way ANOVA were used to compare the data in our study. P<0.05 was
considered to be statistically significant. The statistical analysis and mapping were performed
using the SPSS17.0 and Graph Pad Prism 5.0.
Results
Establishment of PH-LHD model
According to previous reports [32–34], PH-LHD model was established using the banding.
Firstly, we exhibited the position of the titanium clip in the ascending aorta above the coronary
artery during surgery (Fig 1A). After 25 days, the position of metal titanium clip was evaluated
using the Doppler echocardiography, and the graphical result displayed that we have success￾fully established the PH-LHD model rats by putting the metal titanium clip in the right place
(Fig 1B).
Doppler echocardiography of left cardiac function in PH-LHD model rats
In addition, to further determine the changes of left cardiac function in PH-LHD model rats,
doppler echocardiography was adopted to assess the left ventricular dysfunction and the
change of interventricular septum. As presented in Fig 2 and Table 1, the diastolic ventricular
septum (IVSd), diastolic left ventricular posterior wall (LVPWd), diastolic left ventricular
inner diameter (LVDd) and systolic left ventricular inner diameter (LVDs) in the PH-LHD

group were greater than those in the sham group (P<0.05). The ejection fraction (EF) in the
PH-LHD group was lower than that in the sham group (P<0.05). There were no significant
differences in heart rate (HR), ascending aorta diameter (AAO), diastolic left atrial inner diam￾eter (LADd), diastolic right ventricular inner diameter (RVDd), and pulmonary artery inner
diameter (Pad) between the PH-LHD group and the sham group (P>0.05).
RVSP and mLAP were determined in PH-LHD model rats
Increased pulmonary arterial pressure is the gold standard for the diagnosis of PH. Right heart
failure occurs as a late complication of PH. RHC was used to measure RVSP and evaluate the
degree of PH [39]. On day 25 after banding, RVSP and mean left atrial pressure (mLAP) in the
PH-LHD group was higher than those in the sham group (P<0.05). In addition, compared
with the sham group, rats in the PH-LHD group demonstrated a significant increase in the
heart weight and heart weight/body weight ratio (P<0.05), and a significant decrease in the
body weight (P<0.05). And They are similar in the Right ventricular/(left ventricular+ inter￾ventricular septum) (P<0.05, Fig 3 and Table 2).
The pathological changes of pulmonary tissues in PH-LHD model rats
Subsequently, the pathologic structures of pulmonary tissues were identified by H&E stain￾ing in PH-LHD model rats after 25 days. Our results exhibited that in the sham group, there
were smooth wall of small pulmonary artery, thin pulmonary artery walls, large lumen,
evenly distributed cells, and no inflammatory infiltration around the blood; in the PH-LHD
group, we discovered that the walls of the small pulmonary artery were slightly thickened,
the cells were orderly, and a small amount of inflammatory cells were observed around the
vessels (Fig 4).
High expressions of MMP-9 and TGF-β1 in pulmonary veins
On the mechanism, we then investigated the MMP-9 and TGF-β1 expressions in pulmonary
artery, pulmonary vein and pulmonary tissue. And the results of western blotting analysis
uncovered that the levels of MMP-9 and TGF-β1 were prominently elevated in pulmonary
vein relative to pulmonary artery or pulmonary tissue (P<0.01, P<0.001, Fig 5).

MMP-9 and TGF-β1 were highly expressed in PH-LHD model rats
Our previous experiments prove that MMP-9 and TGF-β1 were highly expressed in pulmo￾nary veins, and we further explored the expressions of MMP-9 and TGF-β1 in mechanical
stretching-induced remodeling of pulmonary veins in the early stage of PH-LHD. Firstly, we
certified that the venous blood of rats was collected for ELIAS assay, and the results showed
that the expressions of MMP-9 and TGF-β1 were significantly higher in the PH-LHD group
than those in the sham group on day 25 after banding (P<0.01, P<0.001, Fig 6A). Secondly,
immunohistochemical results of pulmonary tissues also showed that the expression levels of
MMP-9 and TGF-β1 were significantly increased in the pulmonary tissues of the PH-LHD
group with respect to that in the sham group. Besides, in the sham group, a few alveolar epithe￾lial cells were positively expressed, with a low degree of staining; in the PH—LHD group, large
Numbers of MMP-9 and TGF-β1 positive cells were observed around the pulmonary vein (Fig
6B). Finally, we disclosed that MMP-9 and TGF-β1 expressions were remarkably increased in

the pulmonary vein tissues of the PH-LHD group with versus that in the sham group, and 2.0
g intension was more significant for the MMP-9 and TGF-β1 expressions than the 0 g inten￾sion (P<0.05, Fig 6C and 6D).
Mechanical stretching upregulated MMP-9 and TGF-β1 in pulmonary vein
by SAC/MAPKs signaling pathway
To further inquiry the underlining mechanism of mechanical stretching on the upregulations
of MMP-9 and TGF-β1 in pulmonary vein, we adopted MAPK pathway inhibitors (SB203580,
SP600125, U0126) and stretch-activated channel (SAC) inhibitor (streptomycin). The results
of western blotting analysis uncovered that compared with the control group, the levels of
MMP-9 and TGF-β1 were notably reduced in PH-LHD model rats after treatment with
SB203580, SP600125, U0126 and Streptomycin (P<0.01, P<0.001, Fig 7). The results sug￾gested that mechanical stretching of pulmonary vein increased the expressions of MMP-9 and
TGF-β1, while the inhibitors of SAC/MAPKs signaling pathway (SB203580, SP600125, U0126
and streptomycin) could reverse the increases of MMP-9 and TGF-β1 expressions. Therefore,
we revealed that SAC and MAPKs signaling pathways might be participate in the promoting
effects of mechanical stretching of pulmonary vein on the pulmonary hypertension.
Discussion
PH-LHD is the most common type of PH. Due to its unclear pathogenesis and complicated
pathophysiological process [5], there is still no effective treatment available. Pulmonary vein
hypertension is the earliest pathophysiological change in the development of PH-LHD. It is
hypothesized that early changes of pulmonary vein wall will promote subsequent pulmonary
vascular remodeling in PH-LHD. If this hypothesis is confirmed, it will provide novel targets
for the early prevention and treatment of PH-LHD.
Previously Breitling et al found that distinct vascular remodeling occurred in the pulmo￾nary artery within two months after banding [38]. In the present study, Doppler echocardiog￾raphy on day 25 after banding confirmed the presence of left heart failure in rats, as indicated

by increased left ventricular pressure, increased left ventricular diameter, interventricular sep￾tum shift, and decreased ejection fraction. Meanwhile, RVSP and mLAP were increased. Thus,
although pulmonary blood vessels have not been remodeled at this time point, pulmonary
artery pressure has increased. Therefore, we collected pulmonary veins on day 25 after band￾ing, which corresponds to the early stages of PH-LHD, and explore their effects on pulmonary
vascular remodeling and possible mechanisms.
Studies have demonstrated that MMP-9 and TGF-β1 are also important molecules in the
pathogenesis of PH [23, 40]. The former is involved in the fibrosis and remodeling of pulmo￾nary blood vessels, while the latter is involved in pulmonary vascular remodeling and pulmo￾nary hypertension by regulating smooth muscle cell proliferation and fibroblast phenotypic
conversion [23, 41]. Therefore, in hypoxia-induced PH, the expression of MMP-9 and TGF-β1
in the pulmonary arteries increases [41, 42]. In PH-LHD, during the early stages of PH, the
pulmonary arteries have not yet undergone vascular remodeling. Increased mechanical

tension in the pulmonary vein wall is caused by blockage of blood flow in the pulmonary vein
in the left heart disease, i.e., pulmonary venous hypertension. Is there any pathological change
in pulmonary vein tissue at this time that contributes to the later pulmonary artery vascular
remodeling? We found that on day 25 after banding, the expression levels of MMP-9 and
TGF-β1 in the pulmonary vein tissue increased compared to the sham group. Shear stress,

produced various molecules, including MMP-9 and TGF-β1, that acted on themselves to
maintain and adapt to the pathological changes of vascular structure and function [43].
Recently, Qiu et al demonstrated that mechanical stretching could up-regulate the expres￾sion of MMP-9 in the smooth muscle cells from animals with aortic dissection through SAC/
NF-κB signaling pathway [30]. The mechanical stress of the vascular wall during aortic dissec￾tion may influence the structure and function of cells, tissues and organs [44]. Once this is
sensed by cells, it is then transmitted to the nucleus through intracellular signaling pathways,
thereby causing the expression of related genes and leading to different physiological or patho￾logical responses [45]. So, does this mechanism of stretch also occur during the increased
mechanical tension in the pulmonary vein wall in PH-LHD? In order to explore this assump￾tion, we applied mechanical stretching to pulmonary vein rings of PH-LHD rats. The results
showed that there was no significant difference in the expression of MMP-9 and TGF-β1 in
the pulmonary veins from rats of the sham group even a force of 2.0 g was applied. However,
the expression of MMP-9 and TGF-β1 in the pulmonary veins of PH-LHD rats was up-regu￾lated when a force of 2.0 g was applied. These results indicate that during the development of
PH-LHD, as the pulmonary vein wall was continuously stimulated by increased mechanical
tension, the cells became sensitive to the mechanical tension and the expression of MMP-9
and TGF-β1 in the pulmonary vein rings were further increased once they were subject to the
mechanical stress in vitro.
Mechanical stretching has been shown to activate multiple signaling pathways that are
related to some pathophysiological processes. For example, Ghantous and his colleagues

demonstrated that mechanical stretching induced leptin synthesis by activating the ROS sig￾naling pathway, which in turn caused vascular smooth muscle cell remodeling [46]. Seo et al.
found that mechanical stretching induced MMP-2 overexpression by activating the vascular
smooth muscle Akt signaling pathway and participated in vascular remodeling [47]. Ishise
et al. found that mechanical stretching induced fibronectin expression by activating the
TRPC3-NF-kappa B axis, resulting in a troublesome wound contracture [48]. The SAC/
MAPKs signaling pathway is thought to regulate the development of a variety of cardiovascular
diseases [49, 50]. SAC was first discovered in the skeletal muscle cells by Guharay and Sachs. It
is an ion channel that is widely found in various cells [51]. MAPKs are a class of serine/threo￾nine protein kinases widely found in mammalian cells, including extracellular signal-regulated
kinase (ERK1/2), p38 MAPK, and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK). Shaw et al. demonstrated
that mechanical stretching activated SAC on vascular smooth muscles, causing a series of
responses that led to vascular smooth muscle migration and apoptosis [44]. Liu et al. demon￾strated that mechanical stretching mediated vascular remodeling by activating the MAPK sig￾naling pathway in human aortic smooth muscle cells [52]. In the present study, we showed
that 1) inhibition of p38 MAPK or JNK signaling pathway can significantly reverse the
increased expression of MMP-9 in mechanical stretching-induced PH-LHD pulmonary vein;
and 2) inhibition of SAC or JNK signaling pathway can significantly reverse the increased

expression of TGF-β1 in mechanical stretching-induced PH-LHD pulmonary vein. Thus
increased mechanical tension of the pulmonary vein wall in PH-LHD may activate the SAC/
MAPKs signaling pathway, which regulate the expression of genes involved in PH-LHD, lead￾ing to cell proliferation, differentiation, or apoptosis [53–55]. More importantly, functional
changes in the early pulmonary veins of PH-LHD have a subtle influence on subsequent vascu￾lar remodeling. If the remodeling of pulmonary arteries during the later stages of the disease
can be blocked by early inhibition of MMP-9 and TGF-β1 expression mediated by SAC/
MAPKs signaling pathway deserves further study. Besides, in future research, it is also very sig￾nificant to further explore the specific regulatory mechanisms of SAC/MAPKs signaling path￾way on the MMP-9 and TGF-β1 in pulmonary vein after Mechanical stretching.
Conclusions
During the early stages of PH-LHD, increase in the mechanical tension of the pulmonary vein
wall may cause high expressions of MMP-9 and TGF-β1 in the pulmonary vein tissue through
the SAC/MAPKs signaling pathway. Therefore, increased expressions of MMP-9 and TGF-β1
might participate in the subsequent pulmonary artery vascular remodeling. This provides new
targets for the early interventions of PH-LHD.
