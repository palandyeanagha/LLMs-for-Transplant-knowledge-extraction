We screened 1,200 living heart, lung, liver, and kidney 
transplant recipients for hepatitis E virus infection by reverse 
transcription PCR. In 12 (1%) patients, hepatitis E virus 
infection was identifi ed; in 11 patients, chronic infection 
developed. This immunocompromised population is at risk 
for hepatitis E virus infection.
Hepatitis E virus (HEV) can cause acute or chronic 
infection in humans. Four genotypes have been 
identifi ed in humans. HEV genotype 3 predominantly 
infects pigs and deer, but is also recognized as a zoonotic 
agent. As awareness increases, more reports of HEV 
infection among humans, especially immunocompromised 
persons, have been published (1,2).
Analysis of exposure histories of persons with HEV 
genotype 3 infections has demonstrated its underdiagnosis, 
and a source was not identifi ed for most cases (3). Because 
HEV has been reported as a cause of liver disease in solid 
organ transplant (SOT) recipients (4), we screened all 
living recipients of SOTs during 2000–2011 at Erasmus 
Medical Center, the largest SOT center in the Netherlands, 
for HEV RNA. This study was designed to identify SOT 
recipients with acute or chronic HEV infection. 
The Study
A cross-sectional study was performed of all living 
adult SOT recipients for whom serum or EDTA-plasma 
samples were available in the Erasmus Medical Center 
biobank (stored at –20°C and –80°C, respectively, and 
collected during previous routine visits to the outpatient 
clinic; complete methods are described in detail in 
the online Technical Appendix, wwwnc.cdc.gov/EID/
pdfs/11-1712-Techapp.pdf). Some recipients eventually 
had been referred to peripheral hospitals. A Laboratory 
Information Management System database search was 
performed for availability of the most recent follow-up 
sample. Thirty-nine HEV RNA–positive samples in the 
center’s biobank from non-SOT patients were genotyped 
and used as reference for phylogenetic analysis. Samples 
were screened for HEV RNA by using real-time reverse 
transcription PCR (RT-PCR) (5) with primers detecting 
all 4 genotypes and validated according to International 
Standards Organization guidelines 9001 and 15189 (www.
iso.org/iso/search.htm). HEV IgM and IgG were detected 
by using the PE2 HEV-IgM and IgG ELISA (Wantai 
Biological Pharmacy Enterprise Co., Ltd., Beijing, 
People’s Republic of China). A case of HEV infection was 
defi ned by the following criteria: an HEV RNA–positive 
sample, confi rmed either by presence of HEV IgM or IgG 
or HEV RNA in sequential samples. Chronic infection 
was diagnosed by retrospective testing of stored samples 
and defi ned as HEV RNA positive for >6 months. We 
retrospectively tested samples from HEV RNA–positive 
patients so the antibody kinetics and viremia levels could 
be studied. For calculating phylogenetic relationships, HEV 
open reading frame (ORF) 1 sequences were generated with 
primer set MJ-C (6). All viral sequences were deposited 
into GenBank (accession nos. JQ015399–JQ015448).
The 1,200 SOT recipients consisted of 259 heart 
transplant (HTX), 53 lung transplant (lungTX), 300 liver 
transplant (LTX), 574 kidney transplant (NTX), and 
14 multiple SOT recipients (4 HTX–NTX, 1 lungTX–
NTX, and 9 LTX–NTX). Twelve HEV-infected patients 
were identifi ed: 5 HTX, 1 lungTX, 3 LTX, and 1 NTX 
recipients and 2 multiple SOT-recipients (1 HTX–NTX 
and 1 LTX–NTX). For 11 patients, HEV infection was 
chronic (Table 1). The median age of the HEV-infected 
patients was 56.9 years (range 19.9–63.5 years); 9 (75%) 
were men. In 10 HEV patients, immunosuppression was 
achieved by using prednisolone and tacrolimus, combined 
with mycophenolate mofetil (n = 3) or everolimus (n = 
2). Two patients received regimens of cyclosporine and 
prednisolone or mycophenolate mofetil and prednisolone.

All patients who had chronic HEV infection had 
elevated liver enzyme levels; bilirubin levels were elevated 
in 45.5% of the patients (Table 2). Although it proved 
diffi cult to identify abnormal liver functions uniquely 
related to the HEV infection, HEV RNA detection always 
coincided with or was followed by an increase in alanine 
aminotransferase. Apparently no overt clinical symptoms 
were associated with infection; however, such symptoms 
are diffi cult to recognize in immunosuppressed SOT 
recipients. Infl ammation compatible with viral hepatitis was 
shown in 8 of 9 patients with chronic infection for whom 
liver biopsy specimens were available. Other fi ndings 
were F0–F2 fi brosis, steatosis 1–2 (Brunt classifi cation), 
cholestasis, and Councilman bodies.
Samples from all 12 HEV patients were tested for HEV 
RNA and HEV IgM and IgG. One infection was traced to 
2003 (lungTX), 1 to 2008 (NTX), 1 to 2009 (multiple SOT 
recipient, NTX–HTX), 7 to 2010 (5 HTX, 1 LTX and 1 
multiple SOT recipient, NTX–LTX) and 3 to 2011 (all 
LTX). Among the patients, 1 LTX recipient had an acute 
HEV infection and cleared the virus within 6 days. Because 
HEV IgM and IgG were detected 4 years before HEV 
RNA detection, both reactivation and reinfection should 
be considered. The median span of HEV RNA-positive 
time period of chronic HEV cases was 16 months (range 
6–55) with a median peak cycle threshold value of 20.0 
(range 16.7–26.6). HEV RNA was detected during viremia 
(median cycle threshold value 19.9, range 15.5–28.3) in 
feces from 8 patients with chronic illness.
To assess the value of diagnostic techniques for 
detection of HEV infection in SOT recipients, we studied 
antibody kinetics (HEV IgM and IgG) and viremia. The 
median time from RNA positivity to IgM detection was 
32 days (range 0–826 days). Five patients had detectable 
HEV IgM at the time of HEV RNA positivity. In 1 case, no 
HEV IgM was detected. HEV IgG titers were detectable 
an average of 124 days later than HEV RNA (range 
0–826 days). HEV IgG was absent in 2 samples, and in 
4 samples, HEV IgG was detectable when HEV RNA 
was detected. The median time between transplantation 
and fi rst HEV RNA-positive result was –0.3 to 20.0 years 
(median 1.99 years).
Viruses isolated from samples from 11 HEV-infected 
patients were all within the genotype 3 group. Because no 
ORF1b sequences from the Netherlands were available 
in GenBank, ORF1b sequences were determined from 
samples from non-SOT HEV-infected patients in the 
Netherlands (Figure). No indications for a common or 
nosocomial source of HEV transmission were found.
Conclusions
Recent HEV infections in SOT recipients (4,7–9) 
prompted us to perform a survey among SOT recipients 
admitted to the largest transplantation center in the 
Netherlands. Our fi ndings showed that they are at risk 
for HEV infection. Nine of 12 case-patients were treated 
postoperatively with a tacrolimus-based regimen, which has 
been associated with increased risk for HEV infection (9).
The cross-sectional RT-PCR screening detected 12 
HEV infections but could not provide information about 
previously acquired and cleared HEV infections. Real￾time RT-PCR screening was performed for 2 reasons. 
First, because a patient received immunosuppressive 
drugs, specifi c antibodies against HEV might be absent. 
Second, ELISAs have been developed to detect antibodies 
to genotypes 1 (Myanmar) and 2 (Mexico) and might not 
be sensitive enough to detect antibodies to genotype 3 or 
4 (10). Information about results of serologic assays to 
validate HEV genotype 3 is limited, and seroprevalence 
measured can vary with the assays used (11–13). 
Furthermore, independent studies found that sensitivity and 
specifi city of HEV RNA assays from laboratories in the 
Netherlands (S.D. Pas and B. Hogema, unpub. data) and 
other European countries (14) differ greatly. Therefore, 
international standardization should be encouraged.
Although the observed 1% of HEV-infected SOT 
recipients may seem low, HEV infection may be life 
threatening in immunocompromised patients. Misdiagnosis 
of HEV infection as drug-induced liver injury or auto￾immune hepatitis has been reported (15); empirical treatment 
of these misdiagnoses by raising immune suppression 
would exacerbate the condition. Temporary reduction of 
immunosuppression resulted in immune-mediated control 
and clearance of HEV in 30% of cases (9).

Hepatitis E among Solid Organ Transplant Recipients
This study also found that in patients with chronic HEV 
infection, HEV RNA was detected an average of 32–124 
days before HEV IgM and IgG, respectively. Therefore, 
in SOT recipients with elevated liver enzymes (alanine 
aminotransferase), the diagnosis of HEV infection should 
be considered and verifi ed by detection of HEV RNA.
This systematic survey of HEV infections among 
SOT recipients in a major transplant center shows that 
this population is at risk for HEV infection. Given the 
consequences of HEV infection, SOT recipients with liver 
function impairment of unknown etiology should be tested 
for HEV RNA.
