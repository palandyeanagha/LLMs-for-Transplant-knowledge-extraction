In 2020, the Noble Prize for Medicine jointly went to three scientists for hepatitis C virus-related discoveries. Earlier in 1976, an American scientist 
won this award for the discovery of hepatitis B virus. The Noble Prize, constituted as per the will of Alfred Noble, is awarded every year for 
achievements that benefit human beings in the best possible way. Although humans have known hepatitis as a deadly disease for hundreds 
of years, it was the discovery of hepatitis B and C viruses that changed the way we knew the hepatitis viruses forever and paved the way for 
saving millions of lives all over the world, the reason why the Noble Committee has on two different occasions picked up the great minds 
behind the discovery of these two hepatitis viruses and recognized them by conferring them with the highest recognition that one dreams of.
Keywords: Hepatitis B virus, Hepatitis C virus, Nobel prize.

Alfred Nobel was born to a Swedish family of engineers on 21 October 
1833. He developed a carrier as a chemist, engineer, and inventor. 
He gathered a fortune from the patent of the 355 inventions he had 
to his credit, the one that made him most famous being dynamite. 
He lost his brother Ludvig in 1888. Mistaking his brother as him, a 
French newspaper made a headline, which read, “The merchant 
of death is dead”. On reading this newspaper report, Alfred Noble 
rewrote his will and donated his fortune to create a number of prizes, 
which would confer “greatest benefit on mankind”. Noble donated 
US$ 186 million, which was 94% of his assets.
A Br i e f Hi s to ry in Ti m e
The history is not at all brief. There is mention of viral hepatitis in the 
Old Testament and in clay tablets founding Babylon. Our current 
knowledge of viral hepatitis is the culmination of research by many 
over the last 150 years. The first scientist to discuss hepatitis is 
perhaps Hippocrates who discussed and defined causes as well as 
treatment of what he called ikteros.

 In 1865, based on his autopsy 
findings in a patient with obstructive jaundice, the pathologist 
Rudolf Virchow described inflammation of duodenal mucosa as 
the cause of jaundice.2
 However, it was much later in 1944 that Sir 
William Osler endorsed Virchow’s concept and the term catarrhal 
jaundice, initially proposed by Rudolf Virchow, made its way into 
medicine.3
 There was significant advancement in the modern 
understanding of jaundice during World War I, when autopsies 
carried on soldiers who had fallen from catarrhal jaundice revealed 
that not the duodenal mucosal inflammation, but inflammation 
of the liver was the underlying cause of jaundice. However, this 
concept was not well established until the groundbreaking study by 
a group of Danish researchers who biopsied 38 patients of catarrhal 
jaundice and conclusively demonstrated that diffuse hepatitis and 
injury to the hepatic parenchyma was to be blamed.4
Our quest for viral etiology of jaundice possibly dates back 
to the 1930s when it was discovered that certain viruses could be 
transmitted vertically and later to the findings of research in the 
1950s when we learnt that viral transmission was also possible 
through the feco-oral route.5
Vaccination was used against small pox in the 1790s, but it was 
first brought to the notice of scientists when mass vaccination of 
the workers at a shipyard in Bremen, Germany, almost a 100 years 
later, resulted in outbreak of jaundice.6
 The Germans experienced 
a similar outbreak of jaundice the same year at a mental asylum 
in Merzig.7
 There are reports of other incidences where outbreak 
of jaundice occurred following administration of injectable 
medications in the early 20th century: For example the Mayo Clinic 
experience of jaundice following treatment of syphilis8
 and in 
Sweden when there was an outbreak of jaundice in a diabetes clinic 
following repeated use of lancets for collecting blood samples.9
 In 
1944 Beattie and Marshal proposed the use of individual syringe 
for every syphilis patient, as to their observation the cause of 
jaundice in them was not the drug but the syringes contaminated 
with infected sera.10 In the 1930s there were at least two outbreaks 
of hepatitis in children following vaccination against mumps and

measles that reminded the scientific community of the German 
experience of 1885 and strengthened the belief that it was the 
syringe and not the drug or the vaccine that was to be blamed.11,12
And when during World War II, when more than 100 British soldiers 
developed jaundice after administration of convalescent serum of 
mumps that was almost conclusive.13 There are numerous reports 
of such outbreaks of jaundice ever since following vaccination in 
the world literature dating back to the 1940s and 1950s.
Th e Di s cov e ry o f Hepat i t i s B Vi r u s
With this background, Blumberg and colleagues discovered 
hepatitis B virus (HBV) in the USA almost half a century ago. 
However, this landmark discovery of outcome is of unrelated 
research. In their pursuit to unearth the cause of transfusion￾associated jaundice, they came across a protein in the stored serum 
of an Australian aborigine, which they subsequently identified as 
the HBV surface antigen (HBsAg).
Blumberg was a unique character. He started his academic 
carrier in mathematics, but eventually switched to medicine. The 
reason for this change in carrier was simple—medicine offered more 
travelling opportunities! He got interested in infectious diseases 
from his experience in Surinam, where he spent a summer as a third￾year medical student. His first published paper was on the diversity 
of the clinical course of filariasis among different populations.14 Later 
he concentrated on starch gel electrophoresis of serum samples 
collected from different population groups and animal species 
to demonstrate the differences in mobility and concentration of 
different serum proteins. In the course of this research, in 1964 he 
discovered in the serum of that Australian aborigine suffering from 
leukemia that stained red with azocarmine, instead of taking up 
Sudan black indicating high protein content.15 Blumberg and 
colleagues failed to identify this particular antigen in 700 healthy US 
blood donors, but did pick it up in 8 out of 70 leukemia patients.16
At that time, it was believed that leukemia was a viral disease and 
following the above observation, it was believed for some time that 
this antigen may belong to the leukemia virus.
However, the concept of leukemia virus was challenged when 
this antigen was found in 30% of Down’s syndrome patients with 
leukemia staying in larger institutions compared to only 3% of them 
staying in smaller facilities.17 This association between the presence 
of antigen in serum and social setting led to the suggestion that 
overcrowding and poor sanitation may be the reason and therefore 
that the antigen may be infectious in origin. In the subsequent years, 
studies from different parts of the world revealed that patients of a 
wide variety of illnesses ranging from leukemia, hemolytic anemia, 
hemophilia, chronic renal failure, etc. requiring multiple blood 
transfusions more frequently have the antigen in their serum.5
The antigen was studied under an electron microscope which 
suggested that it was likely to be a virus capsid,18,19 which was later 
confirmed by Dane and colleagues.20
Blumberg’s discovery was important for two reasons: firstly 
it gave a conclusive answer to the decade-old quest of so many 
researchers to identify a viral cause of hepatitis. More importantly 
it demonstrated that there are millions asymptomatically, but 
chronically, infected across the globe who are potential candidates 
for developing liver cirrhosis and even liver cancer. Blumberg was 
amply rewarded for his groundbreaking discovery when he was 
decorated with the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1976.
Th e Di s cov e ry o f Hepat i t i s C Vi r u s
The discovery of hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a more recent 
development. Screening tests for HAV and HBV made it possible 
in the mid-1970s to examine cases of transfusion-associated 
hepatitis (TAH) and to demonstrate that only approximately 
25% resulted from HBV and that none were related to HAV. 
Consequently, approximately 75% of TAH became classified as 
non-A, non-B hepatitis (NANBH). Subsequently, chimpanzee studies 
demonstrated that NANBH was a result of a transmissible agent. 
Alter and colleagues at the National Institute of Health in the USA 
had, by then, identified that a new form of hepatitis existed, which 
was caused neither by HAV nor by HBV and termed it non-A, non-B 
(NANB) hepatitis. However, it was Houghton and colleagues from 
Chiron Corporation who identified this NANB hepatitis virus and 
termed the new agent as hepatitis C virus (HCV).21 Subsequently 
the HCV genome sequence was mapped and seven genotypes of 
the virus were identified. The discovery of HCV not only allowed 
the development of HCV detection assays but also facilitated 
identification of potential targets of HCV antivirals. In the absence 
of a vaccine against HCV, it would have been impossible for mankind 
to tackle this deadly virus without the advent of the directly acting 
antivirals (DAAs).22,23
This year the Nobel Prize in Medicine was jointly awarded to 
three scientists from two ends of the Atlantic, two from the USA 
and one from the United Kingdom for their collective efforts is 
cracking HCV. They are Harvey J. Alter, Michael Houghton, and 
Charles M. Rice. Earlier the discovery of HBV only led to the reduction 
of TAH, but not its elimination. The pioneering work of these three 
Noble Laureates not only led to the discovery of a new TAH virus, 
but also allowed the development of screening methods that 
have significantly curtailed the risk of acquiring hepatitis from 
contaminated blood as well as the development of antiviral drugs, 
ultimately saving the lives of millions across the globe.
Conc lu s i on
One organ, the liver, one disease, chronic liver disease, two viruses, 
HBV and HCV, and “the recognition”, the Noble Prize is unique 
and possibly there is no second example of this. Superficially it 
may seem bit unusual for the Noble Committee to recognize the 
discovery of two different viruses with similar implication in modern 
technological age. However, as we dig deep and take a brief journey 
in time, it becomes evident that not only have these discoveries 
a long-lasting impact on our civilization, such discoveries were 
also not made overnight. It took us centuries to identify these two 
invisible enemies and no doubt that these discoveries will go a long 
way in ensuring sustainable development for our next generations. 
Although Nobel prizes have been awarded for HBV (1976) and HCV 
(2020), the Nobel Committee has mentioned that the prize in 1976 
was awarded for “for their discoveries concerning new mechanisms 
for the origin and dissemination of infectious diseases” and that 
paved the way for Nobel Prize in 2020 by elaborative studies 
about mechanisms underlying disease pathogenesis and drug 
development.
