Abstract
Background: Viral hepatitis due to hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus are major public health
problems all over the world. Traditional detection methods including polymerase chain reaction
(PCR)-based assays and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) are expensive and time￾consuming. In our assay, a protein chip assay using Nano-gold Immunological Amplification and
Silver Staining (NIASS) method was applied to detect HBV and HCV antibodies rapidly and
simultaneously.
Methods: Chemically modified glass slides were used as solid supports (named chip), on which
several antigens, including HBsAg, HBeAg, HBcAg and HCVAg (a mixture of NS3, NS5 and core
antigens) were immobilized respectively. Colloidal nano-gold labelled staphylococcal protein A
(SPA) was used as an indicator and immunogold silver staining enhancement technique was applied
to amplify the detection signals, producing black image on array spots, which were visible with
naked eyes. To determine the detection limit of the protein chip assay, a set of model arrays in
which human IgG was spotted were structured and the model arrays were incubated with different
concentrations of anti-IgG. A total of 305 serum samples previously characterized with commercial
ELISA were divided into 4 groups and tested in this assay.
Results: We prepared mono-dispersed, spherical nano-gold particles with an average diameter of
15 ± 2 nm. Colloidal nano-gold-SPA particles observed by TEM were well-distributed, maintaining
uniform and stable. The optimum silver enhancement time ranged from 8 to 12 minutes. In our
assay, the protein chips could detect serum antibodies against HBsAg, HBeAg, HBcAg and HCVAg
with the absence of the cross reaction. In the model arrays, the anti-IgG as low as 3 ng/ml could be
detected. The data for comparing the protein chip assay with ELISA indicated that no distinct
difference (P > 0.05) existed between the results determined by our assay and ELISA respectively.
Conclusion: Results showed that our assay can be applied with serology for the detection of HBV
and HCV antibodies rapidly and simultaneously in clinical detection.

Background
The hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV)
often cause persistent infection, leading to chronic liver
diseases, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma [1,2].
Given the burden of these diseases and the current poten￾tial for cure, there is a compelling need for diagnosis of
active HBV and HCV infection. A variety of HBV and HCV
markers have been used to detect HBV and HCV infection.
Gene amplification tests, such as PCR-based [3-7] assays
are used to diagnose and monitor the efficacy of treat￾ment. However, these methods require cumbersome pro￾cedures and expensive equipment, thus requiring
considerable skills and high costs. Immunoassays are gen￾erally easy and inexpensive. So far, some immunological
methods such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays
(ELISA) and rapid diagnostic paper have been used in
clinical practice. While the value and significance of these
methods are beyond argument, they suffer from several
disadvantages, mainly their inability to produce results
simultaneously. Ruo-Pan Huang [8] has detected multiple
cytokines and antibodies simultaneously on nitrocellu￾lose membrane, utilizing horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-
conjugated antibodies as detecting reagents and visualiz￾ing the signals with an enhanced chemiluminescence
(ECL) system. However, this method is time-consuming
and requires expensive set-up, limiting its large-scale
application. Mezzasoma et al. [9] have detected serum
antibodies against the TORCH antigens on amino-silane￾activated glass slides with fluorescently labelled secondary
antibodies. Unfortunately, this method is also limited in
clinical applications due to the cost of the assay.
In the past few years, protein chip and microarray technol￾ogy has shown its great potential in the functional analy￾sis of the proteome, clinical diagnostics and drug
discovery. It allows fast, easy and parallel detection of
thousands of addressable elements in a single assay. For
instance, the potential of this technology to diagnose
human diseases, such as leukemia, breast cancer and,
potentially, heart failure, has stimulated much interest. In
our previous studies, we established a platform on which
gene chips with a high sensitive visual detection based on
two-probe sandwich hybridization/nanoparticle amplifi￾cation have been employed, and HBV and HCV gene frag￾ments were detected on a glass slide by visual inspection
[10,11]. In this paper, we developed a protein chip tech￾nology based on NIASS method. A protein chip was
devised to detect antibodies of HBV and HCV easily and
simultaneously. In this assay, the enhancing solution was
the physical developer that contained both silver ions and
a reducing agent, buffered to an acidic pH. During silver
enhancement, the colloidal nano-gold served as a nuclea￾tion site for the deposition of metallic silver and the par￾ticles grew in size, giving an intensely dark signal which
could be visualized with the naked eyes. Colloidal nano￾gold labelled SPA was used as a detecting reagent which
could bind specifically to the Fc portion of immunoglob￾ulin from many mammals. The clinical performance of
this assay was validated with a collection of serum sam￾ples previously characterized with commercial ELISA for
their reactivity against the selected antigens. The data dis￾played that no distinct difference (P > 0.05) existed
between the results determined by our assay and ELISA
respectively. In a preliminary test, our assay detected up to
3 ng/ml anti-IgG, which was close to that in the fluores￾cent detection method.
Methods
Preparation of nano-gold particles
Colloidal nano-gold solutions were prepared by the cit￾rate reduction of HAuCl4 according to the literature [12],
filtered through a 0.45 µm nylon filter, and stored at 4°C.
Prior to use, all glassware was immersed in cleaning solu￾tion (200 g potassium dichromate and 500 ml of concen￾trated sulfuric acid dissolved in distilled water to the
volume of 2000 ml) for 24 hours, rinsed 3 times with
ddH2O and then dried in oven. A transmission electron
microscope (TEM, HITACHI H-8100, Japan) was used to
determine the size of the colloidal nano-gold particles and
UV-Vis spectrum was used to analyze the uniformity of
the nano-gold particles.
Determination of the optimum ratio of colloidal nano-gold 
solution to SPA concentration
Prior to the preparation of colloidal nano-gold labelled
SPA, the optimum ratio of colloidal nano-gold solution to
SPA concentration should be determined. Colloidal
nano-gold solution was centrifuged (500 g) for 15 min￾utes, and the precipitate was eliminated. Serial volume
SPA solution (0.05 mol/L) was added to 1000 µl of the
colloidal nano-gold solution which had been adjusted to
pH 5.5 with 0.2 M potassium carbonate, followed by
incubation for 15 minutes at room temperature. After 100
µl of 10% (w/v) NaCl solution was added to the mixture,
the absorbance at 520 nm was measured, and the SPA
solution volume showing maximum absorbance was
regarded as the optimum. The volume of SPA solution in
practical operation generally increases 10%–20%.
Preparation of nano-gold-SPA probes
Thirteen microlitres of a SPA solution was incubated with
1000 µl of the colloidal nano-gold solution (pH 5.5) for
15 minutes at room temperature, followed by addition of
5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) solution to a final
concentration of 1%. The mixture was allowed to stand
for over 15 minutes, and was centrifuged (50000 g, 4°C)
for 45 minutes twice. After each cycle, the supernatant was
eliminated and the red precipitate was washed with 20
mmol/L Tris buffer (pH6.5, filtrated through a 0.22 µm
membrane) including 1% (w/v) BSA and 0.02% (w/v)

NaN3. Following the final cycle, the precipitate was sus￾pended in the same buffer and stored at 4°C.
Preparation of the protein chip
Super-flat optic glass slides (BAIO, China) were prepared
according to the literature [13]. Briefly, the slides were
soaked in 10% (w/v) NaOH and then 0.1 M HCl for 2
hours, respectively. After a thorough rinsing with ddH2O
and boiling for 1 hour, the glass slides were set in 1% (v/
v) 3-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane (GOPTS) solution
(GOPTS dissolved in 95% ethanol) at 37°C for 6 hours,
followed by drying and incubating at 135°C for 1 hour,
and finally stored at 4°C.
Nought point one microlitres of the antigen solution (100
µg/mL) was manually printed onto the chemically deri￾vated slide. Arrays included four antigens (HBsAg, HBeAg,
HBcAg and HCVAg which was a mixture of NS3, NS5 and
core antigens) printed in four replicates. SPA and
HIVEnv36 were used as positive and negative control
respectively. All the antigens were diluted with phosphate￾buffer saline (PBS, 137 mmol/L NaCl, 2.7 mmol/L KCl,
10 mmol/L Na2HPO4, 2 mmol/L KH2PO4, adjusted to
pH7.4 with HCl) with 40% glycerol to the final concentra￾tion. In the assay of evaluating the detection limit of the
protein chip technology, SPA, human IgG and HIVEnv36
(100 µg/mL) were spotted onto the GOPTS-activated
slides in four replicates to prepare a set of model arrays.
The slides were placed at 37°C with the humidity main￾taining at 90% for 1 hour, followed by rinsing three times
with PBS to remove the unbound proteins.
Blocking of the protein chip
The chip was immersed in 1% (w/v) BSA (dissolved in
PBS) solutions for 30 minutes with gentle shaking, rinsed
three times with PBST solution (Tween-20 dissolved in
PBS to a final concentration of 0.05%) and finally rinsed
twice with PBS.
Detection of antibodies in patients' sera
Forty microlitres of the colloidal nano-gold-SPA solution
was mixed with 10 µl of serum sample. The mixture was
diluted with PBS buffer, bringing the total volume to 1000
µl, and incubated for 30 minutes at 37°C. The mixed solu￾tion was placed on the surface of the chip for 30 minutes
at 37°C with the humidity maintaining at 90%. The chip
was rinsed three times with PBS, dried and covered with
silver enhancer solution, which was composed of 700 µl
of citric acid buffer (2.55 g citric acid and 2.35 g sodium
citrate dissolved in 1000 ml of ddH2O, pH3.5), 300 µl of
hydroquinone solution (1.7 g hydroquinone dissolved in
30 ml of ddH2O) and 20 µl of silver nitrate solution (2.5
mg silver nitrate dissolved in 100 µl of ddH2O). After
treatment with the silver enhancer solution, the chip was
rinsed with water, and then air-dried.
Data collection and analysis
The slides were analyzed with a scanner (FOUNDER,
China) and the density of each spot was determined by
the software taken by the scanner.
To compare the protein chip assay with ELISA, a total of
305 serum samples showing different activities in the
ELISA (low, medium and high) collected from Xiehe Hos￾pital (Wuhan, China) were detected. The use of the serum
samples was approved by the patients. The sera were
divided into 4 groups (Table 1) and each sample was
assayed individually. The sera were stored at -4°C and pre￾viously characterized with commercial ELISA (KHB,
China), which were performed according to the manufac￾turer's instructions. The results were collected and
analyzed.
Results
Size and configuration of colloidal nano-gold and nano￾gold-SPA
A TEM was used to determine the size distribution of the
colloidal nano-gold particles. The resulting particles
remained stable and formed uniform spheres. At least 200
particles were measured with TEM, of which the average
diameter was 15 ± 2 nm.
The so prepared nano-gold-SPA particles were stained by
phosphate tungstate and observed by TEM, shown in Fig￾ure 1. Colloidal nano-gold particles surrounded by SPA
were still well-distributed, maintaining uniform and
stable.
Comparison of UV-Vis spectra between colloidal nano￾gold and nano-gold-SPA
A UV-Vis spectrophotometer (UNICO™, China) was
employed to scan the absorbance of colloidal nano-gold
in the range of 500-550 nm with a scanning precision of
1 nm. Only one peak was displayed in the scanning curve
(figure not shown), which indicated that so prepared col￾loidal nano-gold was uniform. This method was also used
to scan the absorbance curve of colloidal nano-gold and
colloidal nano-gold-SPA in the range of 400-700 nm with
a scanning precision of 6 nm. The results were shown in
Figure 2, in which the peak wavelength was 520 nm,

whereas that of nano-gold-SPA was 526 nm. Still only one
peak was displayed in the scanning curve. The shift of
λmaxwas not due to the surface modification of colloidal
nano-gold, but to the change in gold particle distribution
during centrifugation of colloidal nano-gold-SPA. It
meant that λmax of colloidal nano-gold didn't shift along
with the mutual reaction between nano-gold and SPA.
The optimum ratio of colloidal nano-gold solution to SPA
concentration was determined in the wavelength of 520
nm. According to the Figure 3, the optimum volume of
SPA solution was about 12-14 µl (0.05 mol/L).
The effects of various silver enhancement time on signal 
intensity (relative density)
Immunogold silver staining enhancement technique was
applied to amplify the detection signals, which greatly
enhanced the sensitivity of the assay. Therefore, the results
could be visualized by the naked eyes because the small
nano-gold particles could easily be grown to a useful size.
The data in Figure 4 indicated that the detected results
were related to the silver enhancement time. The opti￾mum time ranged from 8 to 12 minutes. When the time
exceeded 15 minutes, the background darkened in a
decrease in signal intensity which was determined by both
spot intensity and background intensity.
Detection limit of the protein chip assay
The detection limit of the protein chip assay was demon￾strated by incubation of model arrays with different con￾centrations of anti-IgG. The experiment was for guidance
only. As shown in Figure 5, the anti-IgG as low as 3 ng/ml
could be detected, such a sensitivity was close to that in
the fluorescent detection method (1 ng/ml) [14].
Comparison of protein chip assay and ELISA
The results for comparison of the protein chip assay with
ELISA were shown in Table 2, 3 and 4. Paired chi-square
test indicated that no distinct difference (P > 0.05) existed
between the results determined by our assay and ELISA
respectively. While with ELISA formats, each analyte was
detected in a separate assay, thereby increasing time and
costs.
Furthermore, no reactivity was detected against HBeAg,
HBcAg, HCVAg and negative control in Group-1, against
HBsAg, HCVAg and negative control in Group-2, against
HBsAg, HBeAg, HBcAg and negative control in Group-3,

The structure of halo disturbance surrounding the nano-gold 
was SPA proteins. In keeping the objective of reacting with 
antibodies, SPA was chosen, for that, SPA could be site-spe￾cifically attached to Fc region of antibody, preserving its anti￾gen-combining activity. And nano-gold clustered for silver 
enhancement.

was about 27.55%, which was due to centrifugation during 
preparation of nano-gold-SPA probes.

and against HBsAg, HBeAg, HBcAg HCVAg and negative
control in Group-4, thus indicating the absence of cross
reaction in the assays (Figure 6).
Discussion
The preparation of colloidal nano-gold-SPA was a key
process of the entire experiment. Many different routes to
produce colloidal nano-gold particles have been reported
[15-19]. The vast majority of processes involved the reduc￾tion of gold compounds in both aqueous and nonaque￾ous media. In our assay, we applied a versatile
precipitation method capable to generate mono-dis￾persed, spherical nano-gold particles using aqueous solu￾tion of gold chloride and sodium citrate as the reducing
agent. During the manipulation of preparing the nano￾gold-SPA, pH of the gold solution was carefully
controlled. Excessively acidic or basic conditions could
easily cause the nano-gold-SPA to deposite. Colloidal
nano-gold particles carried positive charges at acidic con￾dition, allowing attachment of SPA through steric interac￾tion. Therefore, adjusting pH to or above the isoelectric

solution added into each tube of colloidal nano-gold solution, 
while the value of ordinate denoted O.D value of each tube

the adding of SPA solution, and reached the maximum when 
colloidal nano-gold was saturated by SPA.

signal intensity. The concentration of antigens spotted on 
the slides was 100 µg/ml. The silver enhancement time varied 
from 5 to 15 minutes. The result indicated the optimum time 
for silver development ranged from 8 to 12 minutes. Both 
too short (less than 5 minutes) and too long (more than 15 
minutes) development might bring on darkened background.

point of SPA could increase negative charges on SPA sur￾face. In our assay, Tris buffer was undertaken to store the
nano-gold-SPA. And the stability of nano-gold-SPA
solution could be destroyed at room temperature or fro￾zen condition. Four centigrade was becoming to store the
nano-gold-SPA solution.
Actually silver enhancement reaction processes rapidly.
Silver ions in solution nucleate around nano-gold parti￾cles and precipitate as silver metal. Particle grows in size
with time of development. It was of importance to control
the reaction time because both too short and too long
development might bring on darkened background.
Besides, the distribution of nano-gold on the chip and the
uniformity of nano-gold played a part in the enhance￾ment result.
Protein A is a cell wall component of Staphylococcus aureus
that binds specifically to the Fc portion of
immunoglobulin from many mammals [20,21]. And the
binding does not interfere with antigen-antibody reac￾tion. Also SPA can bind to colloidal nano-gold through
static interaction, forming the labelling probes. In our
assay, the well-prepared colloidal nano-gold-SPA could
be preserved for over 1 year, keeping stable and active.
Compared with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
antibodies and fluorescently labelled secondary antibod￾ies [8,9], the colloidal nano-gold-SPA was more econom￾ical and convenient, thus reducing the cost of the assay
and simplifying the manipulation of the experiment.
The common supports used for immobilization are either
glass microscope slides or membranes; however, glass is

preferred because it is more amenable to automation and
exhibits a lower background signal [22]. To attach pro￾teins to a solid substrate, the surface of the substrate has
to be modified to achieve the maximum binding capacity.
Coating the glass surface with poly-L-lysine (PLL) is a con￾venient method which is also applied in DNA microarrays
[23]. The attached proteins are passively adsorbed to the
surface in random orientation through non-specific inter￾actions and can be washed off under stringent washing
conditions [24]. There are several methods available for
the surface activation of glass slides, many of which have
been described [25-33]. Most methods introduced a
chemical group onto the surface of the glass and then react
with active groups of protein molecules. In our assay, the
glass slides were activated by GOPTS. The preparation of
the slides was convenient while the immobilization effi￾ciency was high. The use of the chemically derivated slides
coupled with printing solutions whose concentrations
were optimized in our assay allowed us to generate visible
results suitable for a study aimed at assessing the clinical
performance of the protein chip assay.
We compared the detection results tested by the protein
chip assay and ELISA, respectively. In Group-1, 4 samples
were detected as HBsAb negative. This might be due to the
very low concentration of HBsAb in serum samples which
could not be detected by the protein chip assay. The same
applied to Group-2 and Group-3. Paired chi-square test
indicated that no distinct difference (P > 0.05) existed
between the results determined by the two methods.
While the protein chip assay could detect in parallel anti￾bodies on one chip without non-specific reactions, thus it
is more convenient and costs less time than ELISA. More￾over, it required small quantity of both samples and rea￾gents, which made it economical and useful for those
conditions when large quantities of samples were not easy
to get. Furthermore, it is cheaper and safer than the
fluorescent and isotope ones. The well-prepared protein
chip could be preserved for over 1 year without losing of
activity.
Conclusion
The protein chip assay described is sensitive and specific,
easy to perform, and could provide results in less than 40
minutes. In addition, several kinds of antibodies could be
detected simultaneously without cross reaction. The
results of this study suggest that there is potential for the
application of our method in clinical diagnosis of various
infectious diseases.
