Abstract
Background: Rifampicin and protease inhibitors are difficult to use concomitantly in patients with HIV-associated
tuberculosis because of drug-drug interactions. Rifabutin has been proposed as an alternative rifamycin, but there is
concern that the current recommended dose is suboptimal. The principal aim of this study was to compare bioavailability of
two doses of rifabutin (150 mg three times per week and 150 mg daily) in patients with HIV-associated tuberculosis who
initiated lopinavir/ritonavir-based antiretroviral therapy in Vietnam. Concentrations of lopinavir/ritonavir were also
measured.
Methods: This was a randomized, open-label, multi-dose, two-arm, cross-over trial, conducted in Vietnamese adults with
HIV-associated tuberculosis in Ho Chi Minh City (Clinical trial registry number NCT00651066). Rifabutin pharmacokinetics
were evaluated before and after the introduction of lopinavir/ritonavir -based antiretroviral therapy using patient
randomization lists. Serial rifabutin and 25-O-desacetyl rifabutin concentrations were measured during a dose interval after
2 weeks of rifabutin 300 mg daily, after 3 weeks of rifabutin 150 mg daily with lopinavir/ritonavir and after 3 weeks of
rifabutin 150 mg three times per week with lopinavir/ritonavir.
Results: Sixteen and seventeen patients were respectively randomized to the two arms, and pharmacokinetic analysis
carried out in 12 and 13 respectively. Rifabutin 150 mg daily with lopinavir/ritonavir was associated with a 32% mean
increase in rifabutin average steady state concentration compared with rifabutin 300 mg alone. In contrast, the rifabutin
average steady state concentration decreased by 44% when rifabutin was given at 150 mg three times per week with
lopinavir/ritonavir. With both dosing regimens, 2 – 5 fold increases of the 25-O-desacetyl- rifabutin metabolite were
observed when rifabutin was given with lopinavir/ritonavir compared with rifabutin alone. The different doses of rifabutin
had no significant effect on lopinavir/ritonavir plasma concentrations.
Conclusions: Based on these findings, rifabutin 150 mg daily may be preferred when co-administered with lopinavir/
ritonavir in patients with HIV-associated tuberculosis.

Introduction
In 2011, there were an estimated 34 million adults and children
living globally with HIV/AIDS and an estimated 8.7 million new
cases of tuberculosis: 1.1 million persons had HIV-associated
tuberculosis and 430,000 persons with HIV-associated tuberculosis
died [1,2].
Since 2003, there has been a remarkable scale up of
antiretroviral therapy with 8 million people estimated to be on
therapy by the end of 2011 [1]. The most recent data show that
97% of adults and children on antiretroviral therapy are taking a
first-line regimen, in general consisting of two nucleoside reverse
transcriptase inhibitors and one non-nucleoside reverse transcrip￾tase inhibitor [3]. The remainder is on a second-line regimen,
usually consisting of a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor
backbone and a protease inhibitor. The low number of patients on
second-line treatment reflects the poor availability of viral load
monitoring during antiretroviral therapy in resource-limited
countries, and thus a limited ability to correctly diagnose
treatment failure and switch patients accordingly to more effective
therapy. With the development of point-of-care tests for viral load
under the World Health Organization (WHO) new Treatment 2.0
initiative [4], and recommendations from the WHO that 12-
monthly viral load monitoring should become the norm for
monitoring antiretroviral therapy [5], it is likely that increasing
numbers of patients will be identified with treatment failure and
will need switching to a second-line regimen with a protease
inhibitor. While this is a welcome move, this change will have
implications for the care and treatment of patients with HIV￾associated tuberculosis.
Observational studies have clearly shown that antiretroviral
therapy improves the prognosis of patients with HIV-associated
tuberculosis [6], and clinical trials have also established the
importance of early initiation of antiretroviral therapy in reducing
early mortality [7,8,9]. While first-line antiretroviral therapy using
efavirenz is safe and effective when combined with rifampicin￾based anti-tuberculosis treatment [10], there are challenges when
it comes to using second-line regimens. The combination of
rifampicin and protease inhibitors is problematic because rifam￾picin significantly reduces the bioavailability of all known protease
inhibitors by 75% to 95% by induction of cytochrome 3A4
(CYP3A4) enzymes [11]. Attempts to overcome this adverse drug￾drug interaction by either increasing the dose of the protease
inhibitor or altering the dose of rifampicin have been thwarted by
hepatotoxicity and other problems with tolerance [12], and such
approaches are anyway incompatible with large-scale and
decentralised public sector roll-out of ART.
Rifabutin is an attractive alternative to rifampicin as it is a less
potent inducer of CYP3A4 [13], and the drug can safely be
combined with ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors without
protease inhibitor dose adjustment. Rifabutin is recommended at
a standard dose of 300 mg daily for the prophylaxis and treatment
of Mycobacterium avium complex and for the treatment of drug￾susceptible tuberculosis. Plasma concentrations of rifabutin are
increased in the presence of protease inhibitors [11], and therefore
dose adjustments are recommended. Guidelines from the Centers
for Disease Control (CDC, Atlanta, USA) recommended in 1998
that the dose of rifabutin be reduced from 300 mg to 150 mg in
the presence of a protease inhibitor [14], and the guidelines further
recommended in 2004 that the dose be reduced to 150 mg three
times a week (TPW) when used in combination with lopinavir/
ritonavir (LPV/r) [15]. However, two recent reports have
suggested that rifabutin given at a dose of 150 mg TPW in
combination with LPV/r in patients with HIV-positive tubercu￾losis may result in inadequate rifamycin levels [16,17]. Case
reports of tuberculosis relapse in patients administered rifabutin
150 mg TPW with LPV/r [18] and further data showing that low
rifamycin concentrations are associated with acquired rifamycin
resistance in patients taking intermittent doses of rifabutin [19] all
add to concerns that rifabutin given intermittently with protease
inhibitor-based antiretroviral therapy is sub-optimal.
The present study was therefore undertaken with the primary
objective of comparing the pharmacokinetic parameters of two
doses of rifabutin (150 mg TPW and 150 mg daily) in patients
with HIV-associated tuberculosis in Vietnam who initiated
antiretroviral therapy with LPV/r. Secondary objectives were to
investigate (i) the pharmacokinetics of LPV/r in combination with
RBT, and (ii) the safety and toxicity of rifabutin in combination
with antiretroviral therapy during the initial phase of anti-TB
treatment.
Methods
The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist
are available as supporting information; see Checklist S1 and
Protocol S1.
Ethics Statement
The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board and
Ethical Review committee at Pham Ngoc Thach Hospital, the
Health Department of Ho Chi Minh City and the Ministry of
Health, Vietnam, as well as the Union Ethics Advisory Group of
the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease,
Paris, France.
Study design
This study was a randomized, open-label, multi-dose, two-arm,
cross-over trial, conducted in Vietnamese patients with HIV￾associated tuberculosis - Clinical trial registry number:
NCT00651066.
Study setting
The study was carried out in Pham Ngoc Thac Hospital, Ho
Chi Minh, Vietnam, a tertiary care facility that has 800 beds and
cares for TB patients, about 10% of whom have associated HIV￾infection. In Vietnam, patients with suspected tuberculosis are
investigated according to National Tuberculosis Guidelines [20]
which are based on smear microscopy for acid-fast bacilli and
Rifabutin and Lopinavir/Ritonavir Interactions

chest radiography for those with pulmonary disease. Anti￾tuberculosis treatment is given for 6 months and consists of a 2-
months initial phase of rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide and
ethambutol given as fixed dose combination tablets under direct
observation, followed by 4-months continuation phase with
rifampicin and isoniazid as fixed dose combination tablets. HIV
testing is done at the time of tuberculosis registration [20], and
HIV-positive patients are assessed with a CD4 lymphocyte count
and started as soon as possible on a standard first-line antiretro￾viral therapy regimen - usually consisting of stavudine or
zidovudine – lamivudine – efavirenz as a standard fixed dose
combination.
Patient recruitment
Study patients were adults aged 18 – 65 years, HIV-positive,
with a CD4 count less than or equal to 250 cells/mL and with
newly diagnosed tuberculosis. Eligibility requirements included:-
provision of written informed consent; having a firm home address
that was readily accessible; if female, having a negative pregnancy
test on day of enrolment; having a diagnosis of pulmonary
tuberculosis confirmed by smear microscopy, culture or a chest
radiograph compatible with active tuberculosis and associated
with a typical clinical history and two negative sputum smears; no
previous history of antiretroviral therapy; weight $40 kg; a
Karnofsky score Q $80%; no grade 3 or 4 clinical or laboratory
findings according to Division of AIDS tables [21]. Patients with
the following conditions were excluded from the trial: a previous
episode of tuberculosis within the last 12 months, a history of prior
treatment for multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (resistant to at least
rifampicin and isoniazid), concomitant opportunistic infection
requiring additional anti-microbial treatment, a formal contrain￾dication to any trial medication including hypersensitivity, diabetes
mellitus requiring treatment, recreational drug or alcohol abuse,
mental illness, total neutrophil count ,1200 cells/L, hemoglobin
,6.8 g/dL, or liver function tests . grade 2 (according to DMID
tables). Pregnant or lactating women or women unwilling to use
appropriate contraception were also excluded. Patients were
recruited to the study between 27 September 2011 and 27 March
2012.
Randomization
Patients were randomized to receive one of two individual
treatment arms on the day of enrolment. Randomization lists were
produced prior to the start of the trial by the Medical Research
Council in South Africa (ratio 1:1, mixed size blocks). The clinical
research team in Vietnam used pre-prepared envelopes in
chronological order, indicating to which treatment arm the patient
should be assigned.
Treatments under study
The detailed planned trial timeline describing the intended
allocation of treatments in the two arms of the trial in relation to
the initial and continuation phases of anti-tuberculosis treatment
and randomization is shown in Figure 1. As no wash out period
was possible, all pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated at
steady state, at least 2 weeks after initiation of rifabutin treatment
or with the new dosing regimens. At enrolment into the trial,
patients were started on rifabutin 300 mg once a day (OD), in
combination with standard doses of isoniazid, pyrazinamide and
ethambutol. After two weeks (representing the first 2 weeks of the
initial phase of treatment) the first pharmacokinetic study (PK1)
was done. Patients were continued on the same anti-tuberculosis
treatment and at two weeks from the start of anti-tuberculosis
treatment were started on antiretroviral therapy with stavudine￾lamivudine-lopinavir/ritonavir (d4T/3TC/LPV/r – standard
doses of stavudine 30 mg/lamivudine 150 mg/lopinavir/ritonavir
400 mg/100 mg – taken twice daily) and randomized to one of
two arms:- Arm A = Rifabutin 150 mg TPW or Arm B =
Rifabutin 150 mg OD. After a further three weeks, the second PK
(PK2) study was done and the treatments crossed-over: patients on
the ‘‘A’’ dose of Rifabutin were switched to the ‘‘B’’ dose and vice
versa. Patients remained on these doses along with isoniazid,
pyrazinamide and ethambutol and antiretroviral therapy for a
further three weeks and the third PK study (PK3) done. After PK3,
the patients stopped rifabutin and started the continuation phase
of anti-tuberculosis treatment with rifampicin and isoniazid under
the care of the National Tuberculosis Program. They were also
referred to the National AIDS Program to be treated according to
standard care with stavudine/lamivudine/efavirenz. Patients were
followed up to the end of anti-tuberculosis treatment for another
16 weeks. Physical examinations and laboratory investigations
were done at every PK study.
Laboratoires SERB supplied rifabutin 150 mg capsules for oral
administration (Ansatipine 150 mg, Pfizer) and the new film￾coated tablet formulation of LPV/r, AluviaH was purchased from
Abbott Laboratories (USA).
Sample size
Based on the area under the curve (AUC0-24) for rifabutin
determined in previous studies [19], it was estimated that a sample
size of 12 participants had a power of 80% to detect a 20% relative
change between the geometric means of the AUC0-24 for the
participants taking rifabutin without antiretroviral therapy and the
AUC0-24 for the participants taking rifabutin when combined with
antiretroviral therapy. To provide a target of 12 evaluable patients
in each arm, because patients with low CD4 cell counts recruited
into the study might experience high mortality and morbidity
resulting in a high attrition rate, it was decided that 32 patients
should be enrolled (16 in each arm).
Pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling and drug analysis
All patients were admitted to the Clinical Trial Unit facility the
night before each PK study and were fasted from midnight. On
the morning of the PK sampling day, serial blood samples were
obtained. The first blood sample (0 h) was drawn prior to
administration of study drugs and a standard hospital breakfast
was served exactly two hours (2 h) after drug ingestion.
Subsequent bloods were drawn at 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 24 and
48 h (in the case of intermittent RBT dosing) after drug ingestion.
The samples were placed on ice immediately and centrifuged at
3000 rpm at 4uC for 10 minutes within 30 minutes of collection.
Separated plasma was transferred to polypropylene tubes and
stored immediately at -70uC until analysis. The drug assays for
RBT and its metabolite (25-O-desacetylrifabutin) as well as
lopinavir and ritonavir are described in the following section [22].
Drug analyses for rifabutin, 25-O-desacetylrifabutin,
lopinavir and ritonavir. Rifabutin and 25-O-desacetylrifabu￾tin were analyzed simultaneously with a validated HPLC assay.
Rifabutin and 25-O-desacetylrifabutin standards were kindly
provided by Pfizer. In brief, after addition of medazepam as
internal standard both chemicals were extracted from 0.2 mL of
plasma with a hexane/dichloromethane solution (6/4 v/v). After
vortex and centrifugation, the organic phase was evaporated to
dryness. Dry residue was reconstituted with 100 mL of mobile
phase constituted of [Phosphate mono potassic dihydrogen
solution 0.05 M, pH = 3,85]/acetonitrile: 600/400 (v/v). 50 mL
is injected onto the Eclipse XDB RP-C18, 15064, 6 mm, 5 mm –
Agilent column. The spectrophotometer for UV detection was set

at 272 nm. Lower limits of detection were 12.5 ng/mL and
6.25 ng/mL for rifabutin and desacetyl rifabutin respectively.
Linearity of standard curves was demonstrated up to 500 ng/mL
and 250 ng/mL for rifabutin and desacetyl rifabutin respectively.
Variability of day to day quality controls inserted in each
analytical run was lower than 9% for median and high
concentrations and lower than 15% for low concentrations. The
accuracies (as % of nominal value) for rifabutin and 25-O￾desacetylrifabutin were between 97% and 106% at low, medium
and high QC levels during inter-run validation.
Plasma lopinavir and ritonavir concentrations were quantified
by a validated reverse phase HPLC method as described elsewhere
[22] with slight modifications. The limit of quantification was
50 ng/mL for lopinavir and ritonavir. Linearity of standard curves
was demonstrated up to 10000 ng/mL and 5000 ng/mL for
lopinavir and ritonavir respectively. Variability of day to day
quality controls inserted in each analytical run was lower than 6%
for median and high concentrations and lower than 9% for low
concentration. The accuracies (as % of nominal value) for
lopinavir and ritonavir were between 98% and 110% at low,
medium and high QC levels during inter-run validation. Asqualab
quality controls (France) were inserted in each lopinavir and
ritonavir analytical runs.
Pharmacokinetic analysis
The main pharmacokinetic measures for rifabutin, 25-O￾desacetylrifabutin and lopinavir were derived by non-compart￾mental analysis using WinNonLin software (Pharsight, USA). The
peak concentration (Cmax), and time to Cmax (Tmax) were obtained
directly from the concentration-time profiles. Drug concentrations
at the end of a dosing interval were reported as Cmin and pre-dose
concentrations on the day of pharmacokinetic evaluation reported
as C0. The steady-state AUC (AUCt) during a dosing interval t
24 hours or 48 hours for rifabutin and 12 hours for lopinavir/
ritonavir were calculated for each drug by the linear up/log down
trapezoidal method. As an index of exposure during a dosing
interval, the average concentration at steady state (Cave) was
calculated for rifabutin and its metabolite as Cave = AUCt/t
where t is the dosing interval. The metabolite ratio was calculated
as the ratio of metabolite to parent drug AUCs.
Analysis and statistics
The steady state pharmacokinetics of rifabutin and 25-O￾desacetylrifabutin were determined at each of the three pharma￾cokinetic evaluations and the pharmacokinetics of lopinavir were
determined after the second and third pharmacokinetic evalua￾tions. In order to identify an effect of sequence randomization on
the pharmacokinetic measures, a linear mixed effects regression
model using baseline dose considered as reference (rifabutin
300 mg daily) as a covariate was applied. As no sequence or day
effect was found, the drug groups were pooled and dose levels were
compared. Rifabutin parameters for assessing the interaction when
combined with LPV/r were Cmax, C0, and Cave. These
parameters were logarithmically (log) transformed and a linear
mixed model fit was used which included treatment, period and
sequence as fixed effects and the patient as a random effect. Ninety
percent confidence intervals (90% CIs) for the difference in mean
log-transformed (log) PK parameters for a particular rifabutin
combination therapy (150 mg OD or 150 mg TPW) compared to
rifabutin monotherapy (300 mg OD) were calculated. These
differences in mean log PK parameters and 90% CIs were back
transformed and presented in their original units as geometric
means and 90% CIs. The geometric mean ratio presented in
Table 1 can be interpreted as a relative change (either fold or
percentage) in geometric mean PK parameters for a particular
combination therapy compared to rifabutin monotherapy The
rifabutin regimen combined with LPV/r was deemed equivalent
to rifabutin alone when the 90% CI for the ratio fell within the

equivalence interval of 0.80% to 1.25%. Baseline and final viral
loads and CD4+ counts were compared using t-tests. A p value
,0.05 was considered significant.
Results
Patient flow chart
Thirty nine patients were assessed for eligibility for the trial,
with Figure 2 showing the numbers randomized, allocated to
interventions in Arm A and B, followed-up and subsequently
having blood measurements for pharmacokinetic analysis. Alto￾gether 33 patients were randomized. One patient in Arm B did not
receive the allocated intervention due to early consent withdrawal,
leaving 16 to receive the allocated intervention in each arm. In
Arm A, four patients discontinued the intervention – one due to
consent withdrawal and three due to serious adverse events (one
with cryptococcal meningitis and two with hepatitis in the first two
months of treatment. In Arm B, three patients discontinued the
intervention – one due to impossible venous puncture as a result of
being a previous intravenous drug user, one due to severe anaemia
and one starting antiretroviral therapy in another setting before
the first PK analysis. Thus, 25 patients underwent the three
pharmacokinetic visits (12 in Arm A and 13 in Arm B). One
patient in Arm B was lost-to –follow-up after the pharmacokinetic
analysis, leaving 24 to complete anti-tuberculosis treatment.
Patient demographic and clinical characteristics
Table 2 shows the baseline characteristics of the 33 patients
and the 25 who completed the PK analyses. Of the 25 patients
who completed PK analyses, all had a Karnosky score of 90.
There were 14 who had smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis
and 11 who had smear-negative pulmonary tuberculosis. In 18 of
these patients, Mycobacterium tuberculosis was isolated from sputum,
and in one of these patients resistance to rifampicin and isoniazid
was diagnosed after completing the initial phase of treatment.
Patients were on no other drugs except for anti-tuberculosis drugs
and ARV drugs.
Rifabutin and 25-O-desacetylrifabutin pharmacokinetics
Plots of mean concentrations of rifabutin and its desacetyl
metabolite against time are shown in Figure 3. Plasma
concentrations of 25-O-desacetylrifabutin were always lower than
those of rifabutin concentrations at whatever dose of rifabutin
used. Concentrations of rifabutin and 25-O-desacetylrifabutin
were higher when rifabutin was combined with LPV/r compared
with when it was administered alone, and higher concentrations
were observed with the 150 mg OD dose compared with the
150 mg TPW dose. Pharmacokinetic parameters of rifabutin and
25-O deacetyl rifabutin are compared in Table 3. Morning pre￾dose trough (C0) concentrations were higher when rifabutin was
administered OD with LPV/r compared with TPW. The peak
concentrations (Cmax) and the area under the curve (AUCt) were
similar whatever the dosing regimen, although slightly higher
levels were observed with rifabutin 150 mg OD. Overall, a large
inter-individual variability in pharmacokinetic parameters of
rifabutin was observed. Individual metabolic ratios (25-O￾desacetylrifabutin/rifabutin) showed a similar pattern with higher
ratios observed when rifabutin was combined with LPV/r
(medians 0.57 and 0.64 for 150 mg OD and 150 mg TPW
respectively compared with when rifabutin was used alone with a
median of 0.13) The geometric mean ratios of rifabutin and 25-O￾desacetylrifabutin are shown in Table 1. When rifabutin 150 mg
OD was combined with lopinavir/ritonavir, Cmax was only
slightly lower than when rifabutin was administered alone, and a 2
to 3-fold increase in trough concentrations was observed. With the
TPW dosing, a 35% decrease in Cmax was observed although pre￾dose concentrations were close to meeting equivalence with
rifabutin monotherapy. Assuming that the average concentration
at steady state (Cave) represents plasma exposure, the two tested
rifabutin dosing regimens combined with lopinavir/ritonavir failed
to show bioequivalence. Only rifabutin at 150 mg OD with LPV/
r led to a significantly 32% higher rifabutin Cave compared with
when it was administered alone. Rifabutin Cave reached after the
TPW regimen was lower compared with rifabutin alone. A large
increase in 25-O desacetyl rifabutin concentrations was observed
when rifabutin was co-administered with lopinavir/ritonavir. Cave
was increased by a factor of two to five with the OD and TPW
dosing respectively.
Lopinavir and ritonavir pharmacokinetics
The median trough and peak concentrations (C0 and Cmax) of
lopinavir and ritonavir with rifabutin 150 mg OD and 150 mg
TPW are shown in Table 4. There was again wide inter￾individual variation in individual trough concentrations, which
were similar across rifabutin dose regimens. The study design did
not allow comparison of lopinavir and ritonavir concentrations
when combined with and without rifabutin.
Adverse events
The 33 enrolled patients had a total of 124 adverse events (all
grades together). Eighty percent of the adverse events were low
grade (grades 1 and 2). Hepatic events with raised levels of liver
enzymes were the commonest adverse events with 56 events
occurring in 25 patients. Of these, seven were grade 3 or 4. Of
these hepatic events, 33 occurred in the first 2 months and 23 after
rifabutin was stopped; their average duration was more than 66
days. There was one case of IRIS (immune reconstitution
inflammatory syndrome) grade 3 and no uveitis. There were 4
cases of neutropenia but only one that was grade 3 and none that
was grade 4. Serious adverse events are shown in Table 5.
Response to treatment
Among the 24 patients who completed anti-tuberculosis
treatment with all PK visits scheduled, 22 (92%) had negative
cultures for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and 2 had positive cultures
(one patient was sputum smear negative but had drug-resistant TB
with resistance to isoniazid and rifampicin and one patient was
sputum-smear positive for acid-fast bacilli with the culture

patients, the median (IQR) increase in CD4 cells/mm3 was 127

Discussion
This is one of the first studies to investigate whether doses of
rifabutin at 150 mg once daily or 150 mg three times per week are
suitable in combination with the tablet formulation of LPV/r in an
antiretroviral therapy regimen in the treatment of patients with
HIV-associated tuberculosis. The main findings were that peak
concentrations (Cmax) and the area under the curve (AUCt) of the

drugs were in the same range, regardless of the dose used. There
was a significant and almost one third higher average concentra￾tion at steady state of rifabutin when used with LPV/r at a dose of
150 mg daily compared with 300 mg alone. The intermittent
dosing of rifabutin co-administered with LPV/r led to a lower
average concentration compared with 300 mg alone, although
pre-dose concentrations remained in the same range. The different
doses of rifabutin had no significant effect on the concentrations of
lopinavir or ritonavir. Although there were a large number of
recorded adverse effects, these were largely low grade and mainly
related to an increase in serum liver enzyme levels. Of the 24
patients who completed the pharmacokinetic studies and who
completed six months of anti-tuberculosis treatment, over 90%
had negative Mycobacterium tuberculosis cultures, all but two patients
had a measurable increase in CD4 cell counts and over 70% of
patients had undetectable viral loads.
There have been previous studies assessing the pharmacokinetic
interaction of rifabutin with ritonavir-boosted HIV protease
inhibitors (fosamprenavir, darunavir, atazanavir and saquinavir
[23,24,25,26]. All these studies were conducted in healthy
volunteers with various rifabutin dosing regimens, 150 mg or
300 mg OD when rifabutin was administered alone and 150 mg
once every other day, twice weekly or every 3 days when
combined with a protease inhibitor. All these studies showed that
when the rifabutin dose was reduced in the presence of a potent
drug metabolizing enzyme inhibitor (namely a protease inhibitor)
this led to unchanged or moderate increases in rifabutin
concentrations and a large increase in rifabutin metabolite
concentrations. Interestingly, the steady state concentrations seen
with the daily dose of rifabutin in the absence of antiretroviral
therapy were in the same range as or somewhat lower than those
described in our Vietnamese population [25,26]. There have not
been previous published studies assessing these drug-drug inter￾actions when using the tablet formulation of LPV/r (Aluvia),
which is now the most widely used protease inhibitor formulation
in global HIV programs due to its heat stable properties [22].
A different version of the current study was carried out in South
Africa from 2008 to 2010, in which the start of antiretroviral

therapy was at 10 weeks after the start of anti-tuberculosis
treatment when the patient was in the continuation phase on
rifabutin and isoniazid [27]. In the South African study, it was
found that the peak concentrations of rifabutin were significantly
reduced in patients taking rifabutin three times a week, and,
furthermore, over 85% of patients on the intermittent dose had
areas under the curve less than 4.5 mg.h/mL, levels which have
previously been associated with acquired rifamycin resistance.
Interestingly, rifabutin concentrations were higher in our Viet￾namese population, and only one patient had a Cmax less than
0.3 mg/mL on the 150 mg TPW regimen. The AUCt of rifabutin
during the dosing interval were higher than those measured in the
South African population (median levels for the 300 mg OD dose
were 5640 ng.h/mL in Vietnam compared with 3053 ng.h/mL in
South Africa). These differences may be due to ethnic differences
or other differences in the two populations – for example, the
median body mass index was 18 in Vietnam and 23 in South
Africa. In both Vietnam and South Africa, LPV/r led to a
significant increase in rifabutin concentrations with the 150 mg
OD regimen and a decrease in rifabutin concentrations with the
150 mg TPW regimen. As a consequence of higher rifabutin
concentrations in Vietnam, only one patient had an AUCtless
than 4.5 mg.h/mL on the 150 mg OD regimen compared with
four on the 150 mg TPW and six with the 300 mg OD regimen.
Although the study was not designed to compare lopinavir and
ritonavir concentrations on and off anti-tuberculosis treatment,
trough lopinavir concentrations were higher than those observed
in previous studies [22]. There have been reports for example of
increased lopinavir concentrations on rifabutin which have
decreased once rifabutin was discontinued [28]. Importantly in
our study, the findings showed that lopinavir/ritonavir concen￾trations were not reduced during rifabutin therapy.
It was initially planned that the same study design run in South
Africa would be implemented in Vietnam. However, for various
reasons implementation of the Vietnam study was delayed, and by
the time patients were being recruited, the WHO had released
their 2010 Guidelines for ART, recommending that antiretroviral
therapy should start between 2 – 8 weeks after the start of anti￾tuberculosis treatment [29]. Investigators in the Vietnam study felt
that the Vietnam study protocol starting antiretroviral therapy at
10 weeks was in conflict with recommended international best
practice [30]. The trial was stopped and an amended study
protocol with patients starting antiretroviral therapy two weeks
after start of anti-tuberculosis treatment as presented in this paper
was developed and implemented instead.
Although we were only able to study the effect of rifabutin with
LPV/r in the intensive phase of anti-tuberculosis treatment, we
continued with the cross-over design to ensure that if there was
any sequence effect of the different rifabutin doses on pharmaco￾kinetic measures this would be identified. In the event, no
sequence or day effect was found, and the drug groups could
therefore be pooled and dose levels compared. There is still
controversy over whether Cmax or AUCt is the best pharmaco￾dynamic measure for rifamycins in general. Some studies on

guinea pigs have found Cmax to be the critical pharmacokinetic
parameter [31,32], while other studies on mice and using hollow
fibers have found that AUCt is a superior parameter [33,34]. For
these reasons, both parameters were measured and reported on in
this study, showing that rifabutin and 25-O-desacetylrifabutin
levels were higher using the daily dose with LPV/r than without,
and with the average concentration at a steady state being one
third higher using 150 mg daily and 40% lower using 150 mg
TPW compared with rifabutin alone. A limitation of this study is
that we cannot provide answers about the toxicity or efficacy of
single dose rifabutin, and a more formal clinical trial is warranted
to determine whether daily rifabutin with an increase in rifabutin
concentrations is associated with improved efficacy and acceptable
adverse effects.
In conclusion, this study supports the use of rifabutin given at a
dose of 150 mg once daily when combined with LPV/r based
antiretroviral therapy, at least in patients with a low body mass
index. It is not possible to generalize the results of this study to
other ethnic groups outside of South-East Asia who may differ in
their body mass index and in the way in which they metabolize
drugs. The WHO Guidelines for the treatment of HIV-associated
tuberculosis [10] recommend that treatment is given daily
throughout the intensive and continuation phases of anti￾tuberculosis treatment. Giving rifabutin as a daily dose is in line
with these recommendations. This would facilitate the important
programmatic issue of combining rifabutin with other anti￾tuberculosis medications as a fixed-dose combination pill to be
taken on a daily basis, a necessary measure if the results of this and
other research are going to reach patients being managed
routinely within general health service care.
