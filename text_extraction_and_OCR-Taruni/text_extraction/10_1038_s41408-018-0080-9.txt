Immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis
diagnosis and treatment algorithm 2018
Morie A. Gertz1
Abstract
Immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis (AL) should be considered in any patient that presents to a cancer care
provider with nephrotic range proteinuria, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, non-diabetic peripheral
neuropathy, unexplained hepatomegaly or diarrhea. More importantly, patients being monitored for smoldering
multiple myeloma and a monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) are at risk for developing AL
amyloidosis. MGUS and myeloma patients that have atypical features, including unexplained weight loss; lower
extremity edema, early satiety, and dyspnea on exertion should be considered at risk for light chain amyloidosis.
Overlooking the diagnosis of light chain amyloidosis leading to therapy delay is common, and it represents an error of
diagnostic consideration. Algorithms will be provided on how to evaluate patients with suspected AL amyloid as well
as how to manage patients referred from other medical specialties with biopsy-proven amyloid. An organized
stepwise approach to the treatment of patients with light chain amyloidosis, including established and investigational
therapies, will be reviewed.
Patient 1
A 78-year-old female was found to have an IgA Κ
monoclonal protein in April of 2016. Her hemoglobin was
16.8. The M spike was 1.3 g/dL. Her IgA was 1960 mg/dL,
κ free light chain 4.57 mg/dL, λ 1.32 mg/dL, ratio 3.46. She
was reassured that this was a monoclonal gammopathy of
undetermined significance (MGUS) with no evidence of
multiple myeloma. One year later, she was seen at the
Mayo Clinic because of a progressive decline. Her weight
had fallen from 68 to 48 kg. She complained of numbness
in her feet. She had multiple syncopal episodes and
intractable diarrhea. Her blood pressure was 94/64. This
constellation of weight loss, neuropathy, orthostatic
hypotension, and diarrhea led to a bone marrow biopsy, a
fat aspirate, and a lip biopsy, all of which demonstrated
amyloid deposits. Due to her frail state, melphalan and
dexamethasone were recommended. She died three
months later. Comment: This would be a typical patient
being monitored with MGUS for the development of
multiple myeloma when she had AL amyloid for a year
before treatment was initiated. By the time the diagnosis
was established, the disease was advanced and interven￾tion was unlikely to provide benefit.
Introduction
The incidence of AL amyloidosis is estimated to be
three to five patients per million per year1
. This statistic
would make it approximately one-fifth as common as
multiple myeloma2
. In the United Kingdom, the incidence
is ~1 per 100,0003
. The Medicare claims database sug￾gests that the mean age of AL amyloidosis at diagnosis is
63 with an incidence of 10–14 patients per million per
year with a prevalence higher in males4
. It is estimated
that there are 12,000 adults in the United States currently
living with AL amyloidosis. Wild-type TTR may be pre￾sent in a quarter of the elderly at post mortem and is seen
in 13–19% of patients with heart failure and preserved
ejection fraction, likely making it the most common form
of systemic amyloidosis5
.
The diagnosis of AL amyloidosis should be considered
by a cancer care provider in any patient seen with

nephrotic range proteinuria, heart failure with preserved
ejection fraction6
, non-diabetic peripheral neuropathy7
,
unexplained hepatomegaly8
, or diarrhea. This is much
easier to list than it is to recognize in practice. Heart
failure with preserved ejection fraction, one of the most
common manifestations of AL amyloidosis, can be mis￾diagnosed because the echocardiogram has nonspecific
findings. Wall thickening can be misinterpreted as
hypertension with hypertrophy or hypertrophic cardio￾myopathy9
. Although cardiac magnetic resonance ima￾ging with gadolinium can be quite specific, this test is
often not ordered unless the diagnosis is suspected10. A
pseudoinfarction pattern seen on the EKG could be
misinterpreted as true ischemic disease. Patients with
peripheral neuropathy and a monoclonal gammopathy are
frequently misdiagnosed as CIDP (chronic inflammatory
demyelinating polyneuropathy)11. These patients can
undergo months of immunoglobulin infusions or plasma
exchange before a diagnostic evaluation for AL amyloi￾dosis is initiated. Monitoring for the physical signs of AL
amyloidosis, such as tongue enlargement or periorbital
purpura, is not adequate as these are found in only 15% of
patients. Although these findings are highly specific for
AL amyloidosis, they are very insensitive and their
absence should never be used to exclude a diagnosis of AL
amyloidosis.
For the cancer provider following patients with MGUS
or smoldering multiple myeloma, it is important to keep
in mind that these patients are not monitored solely for
the development of myeloma. Some develop lymphoma or
Waldenström macroglobulinemia, and a small percentage
develop light chain amyloidosis12. At Mayo Clinic, 9% of
all patients seen with a monoclonal gammopathy are
ultimately proven to have light chain amyloidosis. Even
adjusting for referral bias, 3–4% of all patients with
monoclonal proteins seen have light chain amyloid. Fur￾thermore, if a provider does not see one patient with AL
amyloidosis for every five patients with multiple myeloma,
it is likely the diagnosis is being overlooked13.
Evidence that delays in diagnosis have not, as yet, been
overcome is reflected by early mortality statistics for
newly diagnosed AL amyloidosis patients at Mayo
Clinic14. Nearly 20% of patients succumb to the disease
within 6 months of diagnosis, and this statistic has shown
no improvement in 40 years, suggesting, as in patient 1,
that patients who are diagnosed at an advanced state
cannot be helped despite major advances in therapy for
this disease.
An online survey from the Amyloid Research Con￾sortium indicates that 37% of patients are diagnosed over
one year from the onset of initial symptoms with a median
of three physician visits before a diagnosis is established.
Cancer care providers constitute 34% of the specialists
that are diagnosing this disorder, far greater than
nephrologists, cardiologists, and gastroenterologists15.
If AL amyloidosis is suspected, particularly in patients
who have multi-organ dysfunction, biopsies are not the
first step in screening. Currently, 71% of patients that are
seen have cardiac involvement, 58% have renal involve￾ment, 23% have nerve involvement, and 16% have liver
involvement. Despite these numbers, the majority of
patients with cardiac, renal, hepatic, and nerve problems
will not have AL amyloidosis. The first screening test for
these patients, as shown in an algorithm (Fig. 1), would be
serum immunofixation and an immunoglobulin free light
chain assay for k and λ immunoglobulin light chains16
and, if the patient has cardiac dysfunction, a pyropho￾sphate scan17, which should be available in virtually every
hospital in the United States. If these screening tests are
positive, the diagnostic pathway is clear. For patients with
immunoglobulin light chain abnormalities, doing a simple
subcutaneous fat aspirate (https://www.youtube.com/
watch?v=tctYTmxd9gQ) and a bone marrow biopsy will
demonstrate amyloid in over 85% of patients. Only if the
index of suspicion is high would the patient next move to
direct organ biopsy of the heart, liver, kidney, nerve, etc.
Patients with echocardiographic evidence suggesting
cardiac amyloidosis, usually demonstrating thickened
ventricular walls, Doppler evidence of poor diastolic filling
and abnormal longitudinal strain need to undergo a pyr￾ophosphate scan which if positive should be considered
TTR and not light chain amyloidosis. These patients
should be referred to a cardiologist for tissue sampling to
validate amyloidosis.
Classification of amyloid
Accurate typing of the protein subunit responsible for
amyloid deposition is important since it directs treatment.

syndrome compatible with systemic amyloidosis

Only systemic immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis is
treated with chemotherapy or stem cell transplantation.
In all other forms of amyloid, be it systemic or localized,
chemotherapy is contraindicated. Historically, we used
immunohistochemistry18,19 and immunofluorescence20 to
classify the amyloid. These techniques have major draw￾backs. In light chain amyloidosis, commercial antisera
purchased to detect κ and λ immunoglobulin light chains
are usually directed against epitopes on the constant
region of the immunoglobulin light chain. When amyloid
light chains are deposited in tissues, usually only a frag￾ment of the intact light chain is deposited, typically the
variable portion (VL) with a molecular weight of ~12 kd. A
normal intact light chain has a molecular weight of 25 kD,
suggesting there has been deletion of the constant portion
of the light chain, making the immunoglobulin fragment
unrecognizable to commercial antisera. Secondly, the
light chains of amyloid are known to misfold, and the
potential of a previously exposed epitope no longer being
accessible to the commercial antibody exists, rendering it
unidentifiable21. Finally, there are at least 30 different
types of amyloid proteins, and few centers are equipped
with such a large panel of antisera, making it next to
impossible to identify rare forms of amyloidosis, such as
fibrinogen, LECT2, apolipoprotein, and lysozyme.
The gold standard for typing is laser capture mass
spectroscopic proteome analysis22. In this technique,
amyloid deposits are directly removed from a glass slide,
and the technique can be performed on archived paraffin￾embedded tissues. Peptides are sequenced by a mass
spectrometer and then compared with libraries of pro￾teins for identification. In addition to specifically identi￾fying the subunit protein, the technique serves as a
positive control since it will also detect associated proteins
always seen in amyloid deposits, such as serum amyloid P,
vitronectin, and apolipoprotein E23. Although expensive
and not available in all laboratories, proteomic analysis
with mass spectroscopy remains the gold standard for
identification of the amyloid protein subunit.
In a review of over 4000 proteomic analyses of amyloid
deposits, 62% were of immunoglobulin origin. However, a
full 38% were not of immunoglobulin origin, and che￾motherapy would have been contraindicated. Non￾immunoglobulin forms of amyloidosis included AA
amyloid, ALECT2, A-insulin, A-fibrinogen, and A￾gelsolin (Kurtin P. personal communication).
Patient 2
The patient was a 71-year-old male diagnosed with
renal AL amyloid nephrotic syndrome in March of 2007
and underwent a stem cell transplant in December of
2007, obtained an organ response with urinary protein
falling from 10.5 g/24 h to 1.5 g/24 h. The patient devel￾oped congestive heart failure in July of 2013 and
underwent an endomyocardial biopsy that demonstrated
amyloid. Proteomic typing demonstrated that this patient
had TTR cardiac amyloid, and genetic studies demon￾strated the TTR gene to be wild-type, so-called senile
cardiac amyloidosis. He died at the age of 79 of pro￾gressive heart failure 39 months following the diagnosis of
TTR cardiac amyloidosis. Comment: This patient had two
types of amyloidosis. He had AL amyloidosis successfully
treated and had not relapsed after 9.5 years but subse￾quently developed age-related cardiac amyloidosis that
could have easily been misdiagnosed as relapsing AL if
cardiac biopsy and proteomic analysis had not been done.
Over 15 years ago, it was common to identify amyloid in
a patient with a monoclonal gammopathy and assume
that this was AL type. However, in 81 patients with TTR
amyloidosis, an M protein was found in 20 of the 81 and
an abnormal free light chain ratio in 8 of the 8124. A
second study of wild-type TTR amyloidosis also demon￾strated a monoclonal protein in 25% of patients25. Finally,
even when AL is diagnosed with proteomic analysis, this
does not indicate whether the amyloidosis is localized or
systemic. Attention must be given, particularly to those
patients who present with amyloid in a skin biopsy,
bladder biopsy, laryngeal biopsy, or at the edge of a
colonic ulcer or polyp, that the amyloid may be a localized
AL amyloidosis that requires no intervention26.
Patient is referred from a specialist with biopsy-proven
amyloid
Many specialists, when encountering a patient with
biopsy of an organ containing amyloid, refer to a cancer
care provider uncertain of the type of amyloidosis. The
first step for all biopsied tissues, shown in an algorithm
(Fig. 2), would be mass spectroscopic analysis. In patients
with AL amyloidosis, measurement of bone marrow
plasma cells27 and FISH genetics28, as would be done in
multiple myeloma patients, are indicated. For staging
purposes, one needs to know the NT-proBNP, troponin,
and the difference between the involved and uninvolved

immunoglobulin free light chain16. If not already done,
echocardiography or magnetic resonance imaging of the
heart is required since the extent of cardiac involvement is
important for prognosis29. For patients with light chain
amyloidosis in the absence of symptoms, the role of
routine skeletal imaging, as is done in multiple myeloma,
is not well defined due to a lack of high quality evidence.
If ATTR is identified by mass spectroscopic analysis,
this patient should have presented with peripheral neu￾ropathy or cardiomyopathy. The next step in evaluation
would be pyrophosphate scanning of the heart (Fig. 3). A
strong positive scan would suggest that the amyloid is of
TTR origin30. Any patient with TTR amyloid should have
gene sequencing of the TTR gene to distinguish wild-type
TTR, as is seen in senile cardiac amyloidosis, from the
very rare mutations of TTR that lead to inherited amy￾loidosis31. Since familial amyloidosis is not treated with
chemotherapy, these patients should be referred for
genetic counseling, consideration of liver transplant,
diflunisal32,33 or doxycycline therapy34, or one of the
expanded access programs for agents that suppress
translation of liver TTR messenger RNA35,36 into the
fully-formed TTR protein. Patients with wild-type TTR
amyloidosis are usually over the age of 70, 90% are men,
and half have carpal tunnel syndrome37. Currently, there
is no standard of therapy. Although the evidence is weak,
trials of diflunisal and doxycycline should be considered
(rationale discussed below).
Staging of AL amyloidosis is based on a four-point
system where one point is assigned for a DFLC > 18 mg/
dL, a cardiac troponin T > 0.025 mcg/L, or an NT￾proBNP ≥ 1800 ng/L. This provides a staging system of I,
II, III, IV based on the number of points assigned (0, 1, 2
or 3). The staging system has been validated in multiple
datasets, including patients treated with stem cell trans￾plantation, patients on clinical trials, and non-transplant
patients treated with standard chemotherapy38. Other
effective staging systems include a European staging sys￾tem where Mayo 2004 stage 3 was sub-classified into 3
sub-stages using systolic blood pressure and NT-proBNP
at 100 mm Hg39 and 8500 ng/mL40, respectively and a
model based on the number of involved organs, creating a
4-stage model (1 organ, 2 organs, 3 organs, 4 or more
organs; organ model).
Therapy of amyloidosis
The first successful treatment for AL amyloidosis was
melphalan and prednisone introduced in 197241. Auto￾logous stem cell transplantation was reported in 199642.
High-dose dexamethasone was introduced in 199743.
Melphalan and dexamethasone was reported in 200444.
There have been multiple reports on the use of thalido￾mide45,46, lenalidomide47,48, and pomalidomide49,50, as
well as combinations of IMIDs with alkylating agents51,
but IMIDs are poorly tolerated in patients, particularly
those with cardiac AL amyloidosis52,53. The first step in
assessing therapy for an AL amyloid patient, as shown in
an algorithm (Fig. 4), is determination of their eligibility
for stem cell transplantation. Using transplantation in AL
amyloid is theoretically better than it is for multiple
myeloma. Unlike multiple myeloma, the tumor mass
being treated is less with a median of approximately 10%
plasma cells at diagnosis and a median dFLC of only
24 mg/dL. Unfavorable genetics, seen in nearly a quarter
of patients with multiple myeloma [such as 1q+, t(4;14),
and −17p] are present in <5% of patients with light chain
amyloidosis. The proliferative rate of plasma cells is lower
in AL amyloidosis patients, suggesting that once a
response is obtained, it is likely to be more durable than is
seen in multiple myeloma54. In fact, in the pre-novel agent

era, ten-year survival of patients with AL amyloidosis
undergoing stem cell transplantation was 43%55. A pro￾spective randomized trial of melphalan and dex￾amethasone with stem cell transplant also favored stem
cell transplantation, although the comparator arm did not
contain novel agents56. With careful patient selection, the
therapy-related mortality has been reduced to approxi￾mately 2%57. Patients that do not achieve greater than a
VGPR can have bortezomib-based consolidation post￾transplant, which significantly upgrades treatment
response post-transplant58. A prospective randomized
trial demonstrated an improved survival outcome with
bortezomib-dexamethasone prior to stem cell trans￾plant59. The current policy at Mayo Clinic is to give
induction chemotherapy for patients who have >10%
plasma cells prior to proceeding to stem cell transplant
(Fig. 4).
Even with the strong preference for autologous stem
cell transplant, no more than 25% of newly diagnosed
patients are eligible by virtue of age, renal function, and
extent of cardiac failure. The remaining 75–80% are
candidates for chemotherapy. Melphalan and dex￾amethasone demonstrates impressive survival in patients
that are capable of receiving full-dose therapy with a
median survival of just less than 8 years60. There have
been reports of cyclophosphamide-thalidomide￾dexamethasone61, lenalidomide-dexamethasone, melpha￾lan-dexamethasone-lenalidomide, cyclophosphamide￾lenalidomide-dexamethasone62, but none of these are
currently used in the Mayo Clinic algorithm due to
toxicity and the preference for bortezomib. It should be
noted that lenalidomide raises the NT-proBNP in AL
patients63. CyBorD or VCD (cyclophosphamide-bortezo￾mib-dexamethasone) was first reported to be effective in
2012. In the original iteration, cyclophosphamide was
given orally weekly, dexamethasone orally weekly, and
bortezomib subcutaneously weekly. In this original trial,
17 patients were treated, 10 with symptomatic cardiac
involvement with a 94% response rate and 71% complete
response rate with an additional 3 patients who were
previously deemed ineligible for stem cell transplant to
become eligible64. These results were validated in over
230 patients with AL amyloidosis, demonstrating a med￾ian survival in excess of six years, with all patients sur￾viving in stage 1 disease and a median survival of less than
one year in stage 4 disease40. Survival was dependent on
response depth, with patients achieving a VGPR or better
having the best outcome. Achievement of a VGPR is used
in the algorithm to determine whether second-line ther￾apy should be considered. In using bortezomib-based
therapy, one needs to be aware that response rate is poor
in patients with t(11;14)65, a genetic abnormality seen in
nearly 50% of patients with AL amyloidosis. The presence
of t(11;14) should lead one to strongly consider stem cell
transplantation over bortezomib, since this genetic
abnormality does not have an unfavorable impact in
transplanted patients. Predictors of early death after
therapy initiation include the Mayo stage and greater than
two organs involved. The value of cyclophosphamide
when combined with bortezomib remains unproven66.
Daratumumab, approved for the treatment of relapsed
multiple myeloma as a single agent as well as in combi￾nation with lenalidomide or bortezomib, clearly shows
activity in the treatment of patients with AL amyloidosis67
and appears to have a low-toxicity profile. In 2017, 24
patients with light chain amyloidosis were reported, and
only 5 failed to achieve a PR or better; 9 of the 24 achieved
a complete response68. ClinicalTrials.gov lists two phase 2
trials assessing daratumumab in the treatment of AL
amyloidosis (NCT02841033 and NCT02816476). The
combination of VCd and daratumumab is also recruiting
as a phase 3 trial (NCT03201965).
Venetoclax and new proteosome inhibitors
Because of the high prevalence of t(11;14) in AL amy￾loidosis patients, Venetoclax69, which has activity in
multiple myeloma, particularly in those with the t(11;14),
would be a natural candidate for the treatment of AL
amyloidosis. It is given orally three days a week and does
not appear to have cardiac toxicity70. There is a phase 1
trial underway in patients ClinicalTrials.gov
(NCT03000660).
Carfilzomib, the second-generation proteasome inhi￾bitor, has been tested71. A high incidence of cardiac
involvement with AL amyloid makes it a challenging
agent to use. Traditional pre- and post-hydration can
aggravate patients predisposed to congestive heart failure.
Carfilzomib is associated with cardiotoxicity in nearly 10%
of patients. A review of Medicare admissions presented at
the American Society of Hematology showed that
carfilzomib-treated patients had a higher risk of hospita￾lization72. Hematologic responses have been reported, but
its potential cardiotoxicity may be a barrier for wider
implementation of this agent. Ixazomib has been the
subject of a phase 2 trial with manageable toxicity and no
cardiorespiratory toxicity (NCT01659658). A phase 3 trial
of ixazomib-dexamethasone vs. physician-selected stan￾dard of care is underway (NCT01864018).
Diflunisal and doxycycline
Diflunisal plays no role in the treatment of AL amyloi￾dosis but may play a role in the treatment of wild-type and
mutant TTR amyloidosis by preventing destabilization of
the TTR tetramer73. A phase 3 trial demonstrated benefit
in patients with mutant TTR neuropathy74. Given its
efficacy, it is a consideration off label for patients with
wild-type TTR amyloid and TTR cardiac amyloid.
Gertz Blood Cancer Journal (2018) 8:44 Page 5 of 8
Blood Cancer Journal

Doxycycline has been used in patients with both AL75
and TTR76–78 amyloidosis with cardiac involvement. In
vitro, doxycycline appears to disaggregate formed fibrils79.
A trial from Mayo Clinic demonstrated that patients who
achieved a hematologic response to stem cell transplant
had a significantly longer overall survival post stem cell
transplantation when given doxycycline compared to
those receiving penicillin80. In a second study, which was
case control, 26 patients receiving doxycycline were
matched to 50 controls. The response rate was sig￾nificantly higher in the doxycycline compared to controls,
and the 12-month survival was 84 vs. 58%. Although there
is no high-quality evidence and it has not been validated
in a prospective randomized trial, doxycycline is a con￾sideration if no other therapies are feasible.
Monoclonal antibodies to dissolve amyloid
Although chemotherapy can effectively reduce the light
chain burden and disrupt further deposition of AL amy￾loid, it does nothing for resident amyloid in tissues. Three
monoclonal antibodies are undergoing studies now in
patients with light chain amyloidosis that have derived
maximal benefit from chemotherapy but have persistent
organ dysfunction. The NEOD antibody was administered
to a total of 69 patients. Among 14 cardiac evaluable,
there were 8 responders. Among 15 renal evaluable, there
were 9 responders81,82. The manufacturer discontinued
the development of NEOD001 for AL Amyloidosis
because the Phase 2b PRONTO study did not meet its
primary or secondary endpoints. In addition the Phase 3
VITAL study was discontinued based on futility analysis.
The murine monoclonal antibody, 11-1F4, recognizes an
amyloid-associated conformational epitope83. In 26
patients, 8 were evaluable for organ response and 5
achieved this. No toxicity >grade 3 was recognized. This
trial is ongoing84,85. The third antibody approach is tar￾geting serum amyloid P component, which has the
potential to disaggregate the amyloid fibril. Pretreatment
with Miridesap depletes serum amyloid P so that the
antibody dezamizumab can access amyloid in tissues86.
This antibody may be applicable to all forms of amyloid,
not just AL or TTR. It has been demonstrated to reduce
the stiffness of the liver, and SAP scanning has shown
regression of deposits87. Amyloid fibril targeted therapy
with monoclonal antibodies is promising for the man￾agement of all forms of amyloidosis. Dissolution of amy￾loid fibrils can improve organ function.
Organ transplantation
In AL amyloidosis, selected patients may successfully
undergo renal or cardiac transplantation to assist with
organ recovery. For patients that have single-organ
involvement and control of the plasma cell proliferative
process, organ transplantation may be considered. Stem
cell transplantation can be safely performed in patients
with dialysis-dependent88 renal failure89. Failure to
achieve a complete response is no longer considered a
contraindication to organ transplantation because of the
increased availability of therapeutic options and direct
organ donor programs. Once the patient has an estab￾lished complete response, consideration of renal trans￾plantation may be undertaken. Cardiac transplantation
has also been performed in patients with AL amyloi￾dosis90. However, most patients with advanced cardiac AL
amyloidosis are not candidates for high-dose therapy and
may tolerate standard-dose chemotherapy poorly. In these
patients, it may be appropriate to do cardiac allografting
and then follow with autologous stem cell transplanta￾tion91–93. Long-term survivorship has been reported in
highly selected patients who fulfill the criteria of deep
hematologic response and single-organ involvement94.
Lenalidomide therapy is best avoided in organ transplant
recipients that are considered for post organ transplant
chemotherapy95.
Conclusion
The most important first step is suspicion of the diag￾nosis of AL amyloidosis. That would allow earlier diag￾nosis when therapeutic intervention is most likely to be
efficacious. Patients diagnosed with late cardiac disease
will not benefit from any form of therapy due to their
advanced degree of organ dysfunction. Once AL amyloid
is suspected, the diagnosis can usually be made non￾invasively, and deep organ biopsy is not generally
required. Mass spectroscopic analysis should be standard
for all newly diagnosed patients with amyloidosis to
ensure correct classification of the protein subunit. All
patients with light chain amyloidosis need cardiac bio￾markers, free light chain measurements, and a bone
marrow, with a thorough cardiac evaluation. The treat￾ment of choice remains stem cell transplantation, but this
is applicable to only the minority of patients. Patients who
are candidates for stem cell transplant need evaluation for
induction chemotherapy. For patients that are not trans￾plant eligible, the standard of care for fit and unfit patients
would be bortezomib-based. For very frail patients, all oral
therapy with melphalan and dexamethasone is appro￾priate. Second-line therapy can include
immunomodulatory-based therapies, but daratumumab
seems to have a very high response rate and is likely to be
used earlier in the disease. Anti-amyloid antibodies are
likely to have a potential role in the future management of
these patients.
