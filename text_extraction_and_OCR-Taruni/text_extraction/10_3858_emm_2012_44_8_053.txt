Abstract
Most of the previous studies on immune dysregulation 
in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) have focused on T 
cell immunity. We investigated B cell subpopulations 
in ESRD patients and the effect of hemodialysis (HD) 
on B cell-associated immune profiles in these patients. 
Forty-four ESRD [maintenance HD patients (n = 27) 
and pre-dialysis patients (n = 17)] and 27 healthy vol￾unteers were included in this study. We determined the 
percentage of B cell subtypes, such as mature and im￾mature B cells, memory B cells, and interleukin (IL)-10+
cells, as well as B cell-producing cytokines (IL-10, IL-4 
and IL-21) by florescent activated cell sorting (FACS). 
B cell-associated gene expression was examined us￾ing real-time PCR and B cell producing cytokines 
(IL-10, IL-4 and IL-21) were determined using an en￾zyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The per￾centage of total B cells and mature B cells did not differ 
significantly among the three groups. The percentages 
of memory B cells were significantly higher in the 
pre-dialysis group than in the HD group (P ＜ 0.01), but 
the percentage of immature B cells was significantly 
lower in the pre-dialysis group than in the other groups. 
The percentages of IL-10-expressing cells that were 
CD19+
 or immature B cells did not differ significantly 
(P ＞ 0.05) between the two subgroups within the 
ESRD group, but the serum IL-10 concentration was 
significantly lower in the pre-dialysis group (P ＜
0.01). The results of this study demonstrate sig￾nificantly altered B cell-associated immunity. 
Specifically, an imbalance of immature and memory B 
cells in ESRD patients was observed, with this finding 
predominating in pre-dialysis patients.

Introduction
Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) have 
altered immunity compared to the general population 
(Girndt et al., 1999). These alterations are charac￾terized by impaired defensive immune cells, despite 
evidence of activation of markers by immune￾competent cells. Previous studies reported that 
impairment of T cell function is important in the 
development of immune-dysregulation in ESRD 
patients. For example, various types of effector T 
cells such as Th1/Th2 cells, memory T cells, and 
regulatory T cells are associated with altered 
immunity in ESRD patients (Vanholder et al., 1991; 
Haag-Weber and Horl, 1993; Alvarez-Lara et al., 
2004; Yoon et al., 2006). We previously reported that 
IL-17-producing effector memory T cells were 
significantly increased in ESRD patients (Chung et 
al., 2012).

Table 1. Baseline and laboratory characteristics of the patient population
 Much evidence indicates that B cell impairment is 
also involved in immune dysregulation in ESRD 
patients. For example, only 50-75% of adult ESRD 
patients develop protective antibodies against the 
hepatitis B virus surface antigen after vaccination 
(de Graeff et al., 1985), and this clinical finding is 
supported by experimental evidence (Meuer et al., 
1987; Girndt et al., 1993). However, only a few 
studies investigated the effect of ESRD on B cells 
(Raskova et al., 1987; Pahl et al., 2010). In addition, 
little is known regarding the effect of hemodialysis 
on B cell-associated immune profiles of ESRD 
patients. 
 The aim of this study was to investigate the 
B-lymphocyte immune profiles of a group of ESRD 
patients. In addition, we evaluated the effects of 
maintenance hemodialysis (HD) on immune cells by 
comparing the immune profile of maintenance HD 
patients and pre-dialysis patients. 
Results
Baseline and laboratory findings of the patient 
population
Serum creatinine (Scr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), 
and intact parathyroid hormone (i-PTH) levels were 
significantly higher, and hemoglobin levels sig￾nificantly lower, in the ESRD group compared to the 
healthy control group (P ＜ 0.05, respectively). In 
contrast, leukocyte and lymphocyte counts and 
C-reactive protein (CRP) did not differ significantly 
between the two groups. In the comparison between 
the HD and pre-dialysis groups, only the BUN levels 
were slightly higher in the pre-dialysis group; 
differences between other parameters were not 
significant (Table 1). 
Comparison of B cell subtypes (CD19+
 total B cells, 
memory B cells, mature B cells, and immature B cells) 
between the three groups
As shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2, the percentage of 
circulating memory B cells was significantly higher in 
the pre-dialysis group than in the HD group. The 
values were 34.6 ± 12.4 in the pre-dialysis group (P
= 0.008 as compared with HD), 20.1 ± 7.5% in the 
HD group (P = 0.007 as compared with healthy 
controls), and 27.2 ± 6.2% in the healthy controls. 
By contrast, the frequency of CD19+
 total B cells did 
not differ significantly between the three groups (HD, 
20.1 ± 7.5%; pre-dialysis, 34.6 ± 12.4%; healthy, 
27.2 ± 6.2%). The frequency of immature B cells 
was also significantly higher in the HD group as 
compared with the pre-dialysis group: HD, 8.5 ±
4.2% (P = 0.045 as compared with pre-dialysis) and 
healthy controls (5.0 ± 2.3%). However, the frequency 
of mature B cells did not differ between the HD and 
pre-dialysis patients (P ＞ 0.05).
Comparison of total IL-10+
 B cells, immature IL-10+
 B 
cells, and regulatory T cells between the three groups
As shown in Figure 3, the percentage of IL-10+
/ 
CD19+
 B cells did not differ significantly between the 
HD group (1.2 ± 0.5%) or pre-dialysis group (1.1 ±
0.4%) as compared with the healthy controls (1.4 ±
0.4%; Figure 3A). Additionally, the percentage of 
IL-10+
 immature B cells and regulatory T cells 
(CD25high Foxp3+
/CD4+
) did not differ significantly 
between the HD group (IL-10+
 immature B cells, 4.2
± 3.3%; regulatory T cells, 7.8 ± 1.3%) or pre￾dialysis group (IL-10+
 immature B cells, 4.7 ± 2.1%; 
regulatory T cells, 7.0 ± 2.5%) as compared with 
the healthy controls (IL-10+
 immature B cells, 5.8 ±
3.2%; regulatory T cells, 9.6 ± 2.6%; Figures 3B 
and 3C).

B cell subsets. PBMCs were stained 
with anti-CD19 FITC, anti-CD24 PE, 
anti-CD38 PerCP cy5.5, and anti￾IL-10 APC. CD19+ cells were gated 
for further analysis. B cells were div￾ided into subpopulations according to
the expression of CD24+, CD38+, and
IL-10+
; CD19+CD24+CD38- (memory 
B cells), CD19+CD24+CD38inter 
(mature B cells), CD19+CD24+CD38+ 
(immature B cells).
Expression of TCL1A, MS4A1, and BLNK mRNA 
measured by real-time PCR in PBMCs of healthy 
controls and HD and pre-dialysis patients 
After peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) 
of the three groups were stimulated with phorbol 
12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and ionomycin, 
expression levels of TCL1A, MS4A1, and BLNK 
mRNA were determined using real-time polymerase 
chain reaction (PCR). As shown in Figure 4, BLNK 
mRNA levels were significantly higher in the HD and 
pre-dialysis groups as compared with the healthy 
controls: HD, 1.2 ± 0.4 (P = 0.027 as compared 
with healthy controls); pre-dialysis patients, 1.3 ±
0.1 (P = 0.030 as compared with healthy controls); 
and healthy controls, 0.6 ± 0.2. However, TCL1A 
and MS4A1 mRNA expression levels did not differ 
between HD and pre-dialysis patients (P ＞ 0.05).
Comparison of cytokine production between the 
three groups
Within the three groups, IL-10 production was 
significantly lower in the pre-dialysis group (6.1 ±
1.4%) as compared with HD patients (4.4 ± 0.5%; P
= 0.007; Figure 5A). As shown in Figures 5B and 
5C, IL-21 production did not differ between the 
ESRD patients and healthy controls. IL-21 
production values were as follows: HD group, 3.2 ±
1.3%; pre-dialysis group, 2.6 ± 0.4%; and healthy 
control group, 3.4 ± 1.0%. Within the three groups, 
IL-4 production was significantly higher in the HD 
group (101.7 ± 13%) as compared with the healthy 
control group (56.4 ± 15.8%; P = 0.014; Figure 5C).

In this study, we evaluated the B lymphocyte-

associated immunological profile of ESRD patients 
as compared with the general population. Our 
results showed that the distribution of B cell subsets 
had significantly different patterns in each group. 
The most prominent finding in this study was the 
decrease in immature B cells and the increase in 
memory B cell in pre-dialysis patients.
 Our finding of an imbalance between immature B 
cells and memory B cells in the pre-dialysis group 
compared to the HD group is significant. In a 
previous report (Pahl et al., 2010), reported a 
diffuse reduction of B cell subpopulations, including 
memory B cells, in maintenance HD patients in spite 
of an elevation in B cell growth and an increase in 
differentiation and survival factors (Pahl et al., 
2010). In this study, there was a significant decrease 
in memory B cells in the HD group compared to the 
healthy control group, consistent with the previous 
report. However these cell types were significantly 
increased in the pre-dialysis group compared to the 
HD group, which suggests that the immune system 
was activated. 
 In addition, we investigated CD19+
CD24hiCD38hi 
B cells that have previously been identified as an 
immature transitional B cell (Sims et al., 2005; Plebani 
et al., 2007). Of note, this cell type has regulatory 
capacity. In previous reports, it significantly inhibited 
the differentiation of pro-inflammatory cytokine￾expressing CD4+
 T cells in a dose- and contact￾dependent manner (Blair et al., 2010). However, 
whether this cell type was dysregulated in ESRD 
patients has not been investigated. 
 In this study, a significant decrease in immature B 
cells was found in the pre-dialysis group compared 
to the HD group, which suggests that there is 
defective regulatory activity in pre-dialysis patients, 
potentially due to their uremic state. Resolution of 
uremic toxicity by hemodialysis can recover the B 
cell balance, thereby increasing the percentage of 
immature B cells in the HD group. As expected, the 
uremic state was more severe in the pre-dialysis 
group, as reflected by the higher BUN levels. 
Combined with the increase in memory B cells, the 
decrease in immature B cells may reflect the

imbalance of effector and regulatory capacity in the 
pre-dialysis group.
 There were no significant differences in these 
cells between the pre-dialysis group and healthy 
controls. The reason for this is unclear, but we 
postulated that the characteristics of memory B cells 
and immature B cells in the pre-dialysis group may 
differ from those of the healthy controls. ESRD 
patients have non-specific immune activation in 
spite of susceptibility to pathogens (Vanholder et al., 
1991; Haag-Weber and Horl, 1993). Therefore, it is 
possible that the extra memory B cells in the 
pre-dialysis group are not immune-competent cells 
sensitized to a pathogenic challenge, but represent 
non-specifically activated cells due to the severe 
uremic conditions. 
 We further investigated the transcriptional 
expression of markers associated with B cell 
development and differentiation using real time 
PCR. In previous reports, BLNK mRNA expression 
levels were highest in the spleen, with lower levels 
of expression in the liver, kidney, pancreas, small 
intestines, and colon (Fu et al., 1998). Analysis of 
BLNK protein expression levels in hematopoietic 
and fibroblast cell lines of human, mouse, or rat 
origin demonstrated their preferential expression in 
human and mouse B cells. While all human B cells 
examined expressed BLNK and BLNK-s, mouse B 
cells expressed only one detectable form of the 
BLNK protein. Hence, BLNK protein expression 
among hematopoietic cells appears to be limited to 
the B cell lineage, with human B cells expressing 
two alternatively spliced forms and mouse B cells 
expressing a single form (Minegishi et al., 1999; 
Pappu et al., 1999; Chiu et al., 2002). We found 
significantly increased expression of BLNK in the 
HD and pre-dialysis groups. BLNK regulates 
biological outcomes of B cell function and 
development. The BLNK gene encodes a cytoplasmic 
linker or adaptor protein that plays a critical role in B 
cell development. This protein bridges B cell receptor￾associated kinase activation with downstream 
signaling pathways, thereby affecting various 
biological functions. BLNK is a pivotal adapter 
protein in signal transduction from the pre-BCR and 
BCR. It contains multiple tyrosine phosphorylation 
sites that provide binding sites for key signaling 
proteins, such as PLCγ, Btk, and Vav (Kurosaki and 
Tsukada, 2000). BLNK mutations cause a complete 
block in B cell development at the pro-B cell to pre-B 

470 Exp. Mol. Med. Vol. 44(8), 465-472, 2012
cell transition in humans (Minegishi et al., 1999; 
Newell et al., 2010). In BLNK-null mutant mice, the 
developmental block is partial, resulting in the 
accumulation of pre-BCR+
 large pre-B cells in the 
bone marrow and a reduced number of mature B 
cells in the periphery (Jumaa et al., 2005). 
 B lymphopenia in end stage renal disease may be 
partially attributed to an increased susceptibility to 
cell death by apoptosis that is associated with a 
decreased expression of Bcl-2 (Fernandez-Fresnedo 
et al., 2000).
 BCR signaling leads to growth arrest and apoptosis 
in immature B cells, whereas it promotes survival 
and proliferation of mature B cells via activation of 
Rel-dependent antiapoptotic and proproliferative 
genes (Grumont et al., 1998; Tumang et al., 1998). 
Both BLNK and BCAP play important roles in BCR 
signaling (Tan et al., 2001; Simeoni et al., 2004). 
The long isoform of BLNK was also implicated in 
promoting BCR-induced apoptosis (Grabbe and 
Wienands, 2006).
 As shown in Figure 4, BLNK mRNA levels were 
significantly higher in the HD and pre-dialysis 
groups as compared with the healthy controls. BCR 
signaling growth arrest and apoptosis in immature B 
cells, whereas it promotes survival and proliferation 
of mature B cells.
 Tcl1, which is abundantly expressed in immature 
and IgM+
 memory B cells, respectively, plays a 
crucial role in regulating Akt activation, thereby 
affecting B cell survival and death via the 
Bcl-2-regulated pathway. In Tcl1-deficient mice, the 
number of splenic follicular, germinal center, and 
marginal zone B cells is reduced (Kang et al., 2005). 
CD20 belongs to the MS4A family of molecules with 
multiple membrane-spanning domains, and is 
expressed on pre-B and mature B cells, but is lost 
upon differentiation into plasma cells. CD20 is 
unlikely to have a natural ligand, but in vitro studies 
with CD20 monoclonal antibodies have demonstrated 
its involvement in the regulation of B cell activation 
and proliferation (Kuijpers et al., 2010). The 
expression of Tcl1 and MS4A1 did not differ among 
the three groups, which suggests that they are not 
involved in immune impairment in ESRD patients.
 The cytokine IL-10, which is known to be 
associated with the function of regulatory B cells, 
was significantly reduced in the pre-dialysis group. 
However IL-10 producing immature B cells did not 
differ between the three groups, which suggests that 
the major cell population contributing to the reduced 
IL-10 levels in the pre-dialysis group is not B cells. 
IL-21, which is associated with growth and 
differentiation of B cells, did not differ between the 
three groups either (Ettinger et al., 2008). The 
effects of IL-21 on B cells vary depending on the 
context, e.g., whether in vivo or in vitro (Ozaki et al., 
2002, 2004), suggesting that IL-21 influences 
multiple aspects of B cell differentiation. The results 
of this study suggest that IL-10 and IL-21 are not 
associated with B cell-associated immune impairment 
in ESRD patients. To determine which cytokine is 
associated with the defects in regulatory B cells 
found in this study, further investigations may be 
required. IL-4, which is a major Th2-associated 
cytokine, were significantly increased in the HD 
group. In our previous study, we reported an 
increase in Th2 cells in the HD group, and it was 
consistent with the increased levels of IL-4 found in 
this study (Chung et al., 2012).
 In conclusion, this is the first report demonstrating 
that number of B cells with regulatory function was 
significantly decreased, and the expression levels of 
markers associated with this cell type were reduced 
in ESRD patients. This may explain one of the 
underlying mechanisms of immune dysregulation in 
ESRD patients. We anticipate that the results of this 
study may contribute to the development of 
therapeutic options for immune dysregulation in 
ESRD patients. 
Methods
Patients and clinical information
The patient population was comprised of 44 ESRD patients 
(27 patients on hemodialysis and 17 patients with stage 5 
chronic kidney disease, but not on HD) and 27 healthy 
controls. In HD patients, samples were taken in the morn￾ing, one day after HD. All of the laboratory and immuno￾logical results were measured in blood specimens taken at 
the same time. This study was approved by the Institutional 
Review Board of the Catholic University (KC10SISI0235), 
and we obtained informed consent from all patients.
Isolation of human cells
PBMCs were prepared from heparinized blood by 
Ficoll-Hypaque (SG1077) density-gradient centrifugation. 
Cell culture was performed as described previously 
(Alvarez-Lara et al., 2004). In brief, the cell suspension 
was adjusted to a concentration of 106
/ml in RPMI 1640 
medium supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 U/ml penicillin, 
100 mg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mM L-glutamine. The cell 
suspension (1 ml) was dispensed into 24-well multi-well 
plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark). For cytokine detection 
at the single-cell level, PBMCs were stimulated with 50 
ng/ml PMA and 1 μg/ml ionomycin for 4 h (Woo et al., 
2011).
FACS analysis
For analysis of human intracellular cytokine production, 
PBMC were stimulated with GolgiStop (BD Biosciences, San 

 B cell profiles in chronic renal failure 471
Diego, CA) added in the final 4 h, along with PMA and 
ionomycin. For intracellular staining, cells were stained with 
combinations of the following monoclonal antibodies (mAbs): 
CD4-PE/Cy7 (RPA-T4, IgG1; BioLegend, San Diego, CA); 
CD25-APC (M-A251, IgG1, κ; PharMingen, San Diego, CA); 
CD38-PerCP cy5.5 (HIT2, IgG1, κ; PharMingen); CD19-FITC 
(SJ25-C1, IgG1; SouthernBiotech, Birmingham, Alabama); 
and CD24-PE (ML5, IgG2a, κ; PharMingen). Cells were 
washed, fixed, permeabilized, and stained to detect intra￾cellular cytokines with mAbs to Foxp3-FITC (PCH101, 
IgG2a, κ; eBioscience); and IL-10-APC (JES3-19F1, IgG2a, 
κ; PharMingen). Appropriate isotype controls were used for 
gate-setting for cytokine expression. Cells were analyzed on 
a FACS calibur flow cytometry system (Becton Dickinson 
Systems).
Real-time PCR
After incubation for 4 h with PMA and ionomycin, mRNA 
was extracted using RNAzol B (Biotex Laboratories, 
Houston, TX) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 
Reverse transcription of 2 μg total mRNA was performed at 
42o
C using the SuperscriptTM reverse transcription system 
(Takara, Shiga, Japan). PCR was performed in a 20 μl final 
volume in capillary tubes using a LightCycler instrument 
(Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). The reaction 
mixture contained 2 μl of LightCycler FastStart DNA 
MasterMix for SYBRⓇ Green I (Roche Diagnostics), 0.5 
μM of each primer, 4 mM MgCl2, and 2 μl of template DNA. 
All capillaries were sealed, centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 s, 
and then amplified following denaturation (95o
C for 10 
min), followed by 45 cycles of 10 s at 95o
C, 10 s at 60o
C 
(β-actin) or 57o
C (TCL1A, MS4A1, BLNK), and 10 s at 
72o
C. The temperature transition rate was 20o
C/s for all 
steps. The double-stranded PCR product was measured 
during the 72o
C extension step by detection of fluo￾rescence associated with the binding of SYBR Green I to 
the product. Fluorescence curves were analyzed with the 
LightCycler software v. 3.0 (Roche Diagnostics). The 
LightCycler was used to quantify TCL1A, MS4A1, and 
BLNK mRNA. The relative expression level of each sample 
was calculated as the level of TCL1A, MS4A1, and BLNK 
normalized to an endogenously expressed housekeeping 
gene (β-actin). Melting curve analysis was performed im￾mediately after the amplification protocol under the follow￾ing conditions: 0 s (hold time) at 95o
C, 15 s at 71o
C, and 0 
s (hold time) at 95o
C. The rate of temperature change was 
20o
C/s, except for 0.1o
C/s in the final step. The generated 
melting peak represented the amount of specific amplified 
product. The crossing point (Cp) was defined as the max￾imum of the second derivative from the fluorescence curve. 
Negative controls were also included and contained all ele￾ments of the reaction mixture except template DNA. All 
samples were processed in duplicate (Jeong et al., 2011).
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
In brief, a 96-well plate (Nunc) was coated with 4 μg/ml 
monoclonal antibodies against IL-10, IL-21, and IL-4 (R&D 
Systems) at 4o
C overnight. After blocking with PBS/1% 
BSA/0.05% Tween 20 for 2 h at room temperature 
(22-25o
C), test samples and the standard recombinant 
IL-10, IL-21, and IL-4 were added to the 96-well plate and 
incubated at room temperature for 2 h. Plates were wash￾ed four times with PBS/Tween 20 and then incubated with 
500 ng/ml biotinylated mouse monoclonal antibodies 
against IL-10, IL-21, and IL-4 for 2 h at room temperature. 
After washing, streptavidin-alkaline phosphate-horseradish 
peroxidase conjugate (Sigma) was added, and the plate 
was incubated for 2 h. The plate was washed again and in￾cubated with 1 mg/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma) dis￾solved in diethanolamine (Sigma) to develop the color 
reaction. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 M 
NaOH, and the optical density of each well was read at 
405 nm. The lower limit of IL-10, IL-21, and IL-4 detection 
was 10 pg/ml. Recombinant human IL-10, IL-21, and IL-4 
diluted in culture medium were used as the calibration 
standards whose concentrations ranged from 10 to 2000 
pg/ml. A standard curve was drawn by plotting optical den￾sity against the log of the concentration of recombinant cy￾tokines and was used to calculate the IL-10, IL-21, and 
IL-4 concentrations in the test samples.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS soft￾ware (version 16.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Continuous 
variables were compared using Student’s t-testor one-way 
analysis of variance (ANOVA). For categorical variables, 
chi-square frequency analysis was used. The results are 
presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD). P values ＜
0.05 were considered statistically significant.
