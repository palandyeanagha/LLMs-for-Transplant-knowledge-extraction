Abstract
Background: The LACE index has been used to predict the risk of unplanned readmission within 30 days after
hospital discharge in both medical and surgical patients. The aim of this study is to validate the accuracy of using
the LACE index in CHF patients.
Methods: This was a retrospective study. The LACE index score was calculated on each patient who was admitted
to hospital due to an acute CHF exacerbation. Operational and clinical variables were collected from patients including
basic clinical characteristics, length of hospitalization, comorbidities, number of previous ED visits in the past 6 months
before the index admission, and the number of post discharge ED revisits at 30, 60, and 90 days. All variables were
analyzed by multivariate logistic regression to determine the association between clinical variables and the hospital
unplanned readmissions. C-statistic was used to discriminate those patients with high risk of readmissions.
Results: Of the 253 patients included in the study, 24.50% (62/253) experienced unplanned readmission to hospital
within 30 days after discharge. The LACE index was slightly higher in patients readmitted versus patients not
readmitted (12.17 ± 2.22 versus 11.80 ± 1.92, p = 0.199). Adjusted odds ratios based on logistic regression of all clinical
variables showed only the number of previous ED visits (OR 1.79, 95% CI 1.30-2.47, p < 0.001), history of myocardial
infarction (OR 2.51, 95% CI 1.02-6.21, p = 0.045), and history of peripheral vascular disease (OR 10.75, 95% CI 1.52-75.73,
p = 0.017) increased the risk of unplanned readmission within 30 days of hospital discharge. However, patients with
high LACE scores (≥10) had a significantly higher rate of ED revisits (15.04% vs 0%) within 30 days from the index
discharge than those with low LACE scores (p = 0.030).
Conclusion: The LACE index may not accurately predict unplanned readmissions within 30 days from hospital
discharge in CHF patients. The LACE high risk index may have utility as a screening tool to predict high risk ED
revisits after hospital discharge.
Background
Readmission is considered a second admission to hos￾pital within a short period of time (usually within 30 days)
from hospital discharge and has been considered both
costly and an indication of poor health care quality deliv￾ery [1,2]. A recent study reported 30 days hospital re￾admission of approximately 20% among all Medicare
patients with an estimated cost of 17.4 billion US dollars
[3]. In order to properly use and reduce the significant
healthcare cost, a number of interventions designed to
prevent and reduce hospital readmissions were reported
by different studies. However, the success of these studies
was largely dependent on proper identification of patients
at high risk for readmission [4-6]. Several scoring systems
have been reported to predict unplanned readmissions
and the LACE index is one of the most commonly used
systems in the US [1,7-9].
The LACE index has been used to predict the risk of
unplanned readmission or death within 30 days after
hospital discharge in both medical and surgical patients.
It includes the length of hospitalization stay (“L”), acuity
of the admission (“A”), comorbidities of patients (“C”),
and emergency department use of patients (“E”). Studies
of the LACE index showed that higher LACE scores pre￾dicted higher patient readmissions (see detail in Table 1).
In general, the LACE index score of greater than ten is
considered patients at high risk for unplanned hospital

readmissions [8]. However, the results of the LACE
index in predicting readmissions were controversial in
different studies, especially lack of validation if applied
to a particular patient population [10,11].
Congestive heart failure (CHF) is one of the most
common and severe diseases seen in the Emergency De￾partment (ED) and is associated with very high hospital
admissions and readmissions [12,13]. Previous studies in
CHF showed readmissions might be associated with length
of hospitalization, medical comorbidities, frequent ED re￾visits, low literacy skills, and severity of illness [14-16]. In
order to reduce high readmissions, it is suggested that high
risk CHF patients need to be identified earlier and be linked
to some intervention programs upon discharge [13,17].
Therefore, the aim of this observational study was to
externally validate the accuracy of using the LACE index
to predict 30 days readmissions in CHF patients. Our
secondary goal was to determine the potential independ￾ent risk factors that are predictive of readmission if the
LACE index was determined unreliable.
Methods
Study Design and Population: This was a retrospective
study of adult patients who presented to an urban pub￾licly funded hospital ED with CHF exacerbations be￾tween June 2012 and June 2013. The study population
included patients greater than 18 years of age. All pa￾tients were admitted to hospital from the ED due to

CHF exacerbation. Patients receiving a discharge diagnosis
of CHF based on criteria from the 9th edition of inter￾national classification of disease (ICD-9) code were in￾cluded. The diagnosis of CHF was confirmed by cardiology
consult notes, ICD-9 code discharge diagnosis, or recent
echocardiography report. Recent echocardiography was de￾fined as a study performed at either the index admission or
within 6 months. For patients admitted more than once
during the study period, only the initial admission was in￾cluded. Study excluded patients who died in hospital or
whose primary diagnosis was not CHF exacerbation. Study
also excluded patients that were not admitted directly from
ED due to an extreme small sample size (only 5 patients)
likely causing significant bias. Hospital readmission was de￾fined as all cause patient readmission from the ED for the
second time within 30 days of the index admission. It is as￾sumed that patient readmissions had not been arranged or
planned if they presented directly to the ED prior to hos￾pital readmission. This study was approved by the local
John Peter Smith Health Network Institutional Review
Board.
Clinical variables and data collection: Patient demo￾graphic data and their medical history records were
reviewed using the electronic health record. Variables in￾cluding age, gender, ethnicity, the number of previous
ED visit within 6 months, the length of hospitalization
stay (LOS), and the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI)
were collected. The LACE index was then calculated as
reported in previous studies [14-16]. Thirty days read￾missions, mortality, and post discharge ED visits were
also obtained from the electronic health record.
Statistics: Univariate comparisons between patients that
were readmitted to hospital within 30 days versus those
not readmitted were analyzed. The student t test was used
for continuous data and the χ2 test was used for categorical
data. To exclude potential confounding factors, all variables
were then analyzed using multivariate logistic regression.
C-statistic (area under the receiver operating characteris￾tics) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was used to assess
the discriminatory power of the model and compare good￾ness of fit for logistic regression. A value of 0.5 indicates
the model is no better than chance for making a prediction.
A value of 0.7 or higher is considered statistically significant
to identify a difference between groups. All other tests were
two-sided with p value less than 0.05 considered statisti￾cally significant. Stata 12.0 statistical software (Stata Corp,
College Station, TX, USA) was used for statistical data
analysis.
Results
The LACE index may not accurately predict unplanned
readmissions.
Between June 2012 and June 2013, a total of 343 patients
were admitted to hospital with the primary admission
diagnoses of CHF exacerbations. Among all these 343
patients, 5 patients were directly admitted from outside
ED and the other 85 patients were admitted to hospital
multiple times with CHF exacerbations. Therefore, a
total of 253 patients were included in this study. The
rate of unplanned readmission to hospital within 30 days
of index discharge for this group was 24.50% (62/253).
The average Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) score was
4.56 ± 0.98 and average LACE index score was 11.89 ±
2.00. Considering a higher LACE index (LACE ≥10) indi￾cates higher unplanned readmissions, patients were di￾vided into two groups based on their LACE index scores.
There were no statistical significant difference on patient
basic characteristics between these two groups including
age, gender, and ethnicity (p > 0.05). However, our results
also show no significant difference in readmissions be￾tween these two groups as well (High LACE group:
24.34% versus Low LACE group: 25.93%, p = 0.856). This
indicates that a value of 10 may not accurately differenti￾ate the low limit index score in terms of predicting un￾planned readmissions in our CHF patients. In order to
determine whether the LACE index itself is a reliable clin￾ical decision tool and what is an accurate low limit index
score above which the predictability of readmissions
among high risk patients is improved, patients were strati￾fied into two groups based on whether or not they experi￾enced unplanned readmissions within 30 days of index
discharge. The results of our study show the LACE index
is slightly higher in patients that experienced readmissions
versus those that did not (12.17 ± 2.22 versus 11.80 ± 1.92,
p = 0.199).The LACE index in both groups was higher
than 10 and no statistically significant difference was
reached (Table 2). In addition, the C-statistic of logistic re￾gression for the LACE index was 0.5610 (95% CI: 0.4771-
0.6447) which was again not discriminative for predicting
readmissions in the study population regardless whether
or not patients achieved a high risk LACE index.
Therefore, our results suggest that the LACE index
may not accurately predict for unplanned readmissions
in CHF patients.
Frequent ED visits before the index admission and his￾tory of myocardial infarction or peripheral vascular dis￾ease might increase the risk of readmission within
30 days from index discharge in CHF patients.
All clinical variables were analyzed to determine po￾tential independent risk factors that could predict re￾admission more accurately than the LACE index. In
order to avoid confounding factors, a multivariate logis￾tic regression model was used for variable analysis. Our
results showed only three clinical variables demonstrate
significant differences between patients readmitted within
30 days of discharge versus those not readmitted. These
independent risk factors included (1) the number of ED
visits in the past 6 months before the index admission

(adjusted OR = 1.79), (2) history of myocardial infarction
(MI, adjusted OR = 2.51), and (3) history of peripheral vas￾cular diseases (PVD, adjusted OR = 10.75). Table 3 shows
the adjusted odds ratios of clinical variables between the
readmission versus non-readmission groups. Our findings
suggest frequent prior ED visits and history of MI or PVD
might increase the risk of readmissions within 30 days
from hospital discharge in CHF patients.
LACE index can predict ED revisits more accurately than it
predicts unplanned readmissions
Patients were followed up after 30, 60, and 90 days from
the index discharge. Unplanned readmissions, deaths,
and post discharge ED revisits were reviewed. We ana￾lyzed the role of the LACE index in the prediction of
both unplanned hospital readmissions and post dis￾charge ED revisits. Our results showed high risk patients
(LACE ≥10) had slightly lower unplanned readmissions
within 30 days from index discharge, however no signifi￾cant statistical difference was reached between groups.
Only one patient died within 30 days of hospital dis￾charge and this patient fell into the high risk LACE
index group. In addition, when extending unplanned
readmissions analysis to 60 and 90 days, the LACE index
again demonstrated poor prediction of readmissions.
When ED revisits after the index hospital discharge were
evaluated, our results show that patients with a high
LACE score (≥10) had a higher rate of ED revisits
(15.04%) within 30 days from index discharge, whereas,
no patient with a low LACE score visited the ED within
30 days. The results were also consistent when extended
up to 90 days from index discharge (Table 4). Using the

LACE index to predict likelihood of ED revisits at 30,
60, and 90 days post discharge the odds ratios were 1.42,
1.29, and 1.23 separately (p < 0.01). The C-statistics asso￾ciated with the LACE index were 0.66, 0.63, and 0.60 re￾spectively (Figure 1). Taken together, our study shows
the LACE index can predict ED revisits more accurately
than unplanned readmissions after the index discharge.
Discussion
Unplanned hospital readmissions are considered a marker
of the quality of hospital care based on the underlying rea￾son that return visits were related to premature discharge
and inadequate treatment [18,19]. This occurs commonly
in the CHF population [20]. The LACE index is an easy
to use scoring tool that was reported by several studies
to be accurate for predicting the risk of early death or
unplanned readmission after discharge from hospital
[17,21,22]. However, other studies showed poor per￾formance of the LACE index in different patient popu￾lations [16,23,24]. Our results also show that use of the
LACE index to identify high risk CHF patients for read￾missions is not reliable.
Our study population had a high Charlson comorbid￾ity index score (mean CCI = 4.56) resulting in a higher
average LACE score (mean LACE score = 11.89). How￾ever, the population examined whereby the LACE index
was initially derived had a mean CCI score of 0.5 and a
mean LACE score of 6.0 which was much lower than
our study population [14]. This may, in part, explain the
inconsistency of using the LACE index to predict read￾missions in our study. In addition, our study population
had relatively high psychosocial risks including transpor￾tation challenges, active psychiatric problems, lacking pri￾mary care physicians, less commercial insurance coverage,
or no insurance which could lead to frequent ED visits.
This phenomenon not only occurred in patients with
frequent readmissions, it also occurred commonly in pa￾tients with no readmissions showing the high consistency
in this study population (Table 2). Similar results from
other studies showed the high occurrence of medication
noncompliance, a lack of primary care follow up, and/or a
lack of family support placed patients into a high risk
group more likely to develop chronic disease exacerba￾tions resulting in more frequent hospital readmissions
[25-27]. Taken together, it is noted that due to significant
differences in study populations, the LACE index may not
reliably predict hospital readmissions accurately.
An independent risk factor that demonstrated reliable
predictability of readmissions in our study was number
of ED visits prior to the index admission. This suggests
that frequent ED visits may result in a higher frequency
of hospital readmissions. This could be related to a
higher burden of chronic illness among these patients.
Patients having chronic medical conditions may experi￾ence a higher frequency of ED visits, higher rates of hos￾pital admissions, and more lengthy hospital stays [27,28].
It could also be attributed to the extreme age reported in
some studies [28,29]. Our study results showed length of
hospital stay, age, and CCI score had no significant differ￾ence regardless as to whether patients were readmitted or
not. Further review of chronic illnesses in the study popu￾lation showed that patients with a history of MI or PVD
tended to have more hospital readmissions. Similar re￾sults are found within Medicare data reporting comor￾bidities including history of diabetes, MI, PVD, and
stroke could predict a higher risk of readmissions in
CHF patients [30]. Previous studies found MI and CHF
were the two most common diseases associated with
high admissions and readmissions [31]. The coexistence
of these two chronic conditions is high [32]. Our study
confirmed the hypothesis and showed that CHF patients
with history of MI experienced higher readmissions but

did not discriminate as to whether or not MI was a conse￾quence of CHF.
To the best of our knowledge, there is no previously
published study that investigates the link between the
LACE index and post index discharge ED revisits. Our
study found that the LACE index can predict post
discharge ED revisits more accurately than it predicts
hospital readmissions though this predictability is not
overwhelming (c < 0.7). A high LACE index predicts a
high risk of post discharge ED visits when patients are
followed up to 90 days post index discharge. Addition￾ally patients with a low LACE index experienced no ED
revisits within 30 days post index discharge. Our study
also showed CHF patients with history of prior frequent
ED visits are highly likely to have the same pattern of
frequent ED revisits during the post index discharge
period. This could be due, at least partially, to the high
psychosocial risks and associated comorbidities in our
study population. These patients tend to use the ED as
their primary resource for health care. In addition, given
the fact of other comorbidities affecting hospital read￾missions indicates its complexity and multifactory. Since
the LACE index is a user friendly tool, it is practical to
screen CHF patients before hospital discharge to identify
relatively high risk patients. With limited health care re￾sources at their disposable, these CHF patients with a
high risk LACE index can be prioritized to services link￾ing them to community intervention programs. Several
CHF intervention programs are now in place in our
community providing an alternate resource for these pa￾tients and curbing ED overuse for health maintenance
needs among them.
Limitation
This is a retrospective study from a single urban tertiary
care publicly funded hospital with a special patient popu￾lation. Retrospective methodology limits its applicability
in a way that includes bias regarding the accuracy of infor￾mation, potential selection bias due to one institutional
database, incomplete follow up data, and incomplete

regression for the LACE index to predict post discharge 30 days ED revisits is 0.6637 (95% CI: 0.5750-0.7523), 60 days post discharge ED revisits is
0.6307 (95% CI: 0.5485-0.7128), and that of the post discharge 90 days ED revisits is 0.6029 (95% CI: 0.5248-0.6809) which was more accurate than
predicting hospital readmissions at the same time period in the study population though still not overwhelming (C-statistic <0.7).

inter-subject data for analysis. In addition, as this study
examines data associated only with patients admitted from
the ED and excludes patients admitted from other primary
care services this might also lead to patient selection bias.
Second, all readmissions were reviewed and collected
from hospital electronic health records. Patients that may
have been admitted to other hospitals were not included
in this study. This may contribute to incomplete follow up
data. We did monitor other measures during the patient
post-discharge period, such as follow up visits with pri￾mary care physicians and ED revisits. With many high risk
psychosocial patients in our study population a certain
number of them were lost to follow up which may also
lead to incomplete and/or inaccurate analysis of data. A
multicenter prospective study is required to more accur￾ately identify CHF patients at high risk of hospital re￾admission and ED revisits and to further validate the
results of this study.
Conclusion
In conclusion, our study shows application of the LACE
index to identify CHF patients at high risk for unplanned
readmissions within 30 days of discharge may not be re￾liable. Better predictors of high risk readmissions among
CHF patients may be 1) number of previous ED visits,
2) history of MI, 3) and/or history of PVD. A LACE high
risk index may have the best application in predicting
the likelihood of ED revisits in the post index discharge
period and therefore be of particular interest in linking
these patients to alternate community healthcare services
thereby curbing ED overuse among this population.
