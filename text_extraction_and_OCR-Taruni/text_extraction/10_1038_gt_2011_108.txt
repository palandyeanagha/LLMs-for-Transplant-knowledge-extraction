Gene therapy in a murine model of methylmalonic acidemia
using rAAV9-mediated gene delivery

Methylmalonic acidemia (MMA), an inherited metabolic disorder caused by deficient activity of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase,
carries a poor prognosis for long-term survival. While administration of a recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 8 vector
(rAAV8) can rescue Mut/ mice from neonatal lethality and provide sustained phenotypic correction, translation of gene therapy
to human subjects will likely require multiple rounds of systemic administration and, ideally, the use of a vector that transduces
the kidney. To examine the effectiveness of alternative rAAVs in the treatment of MMA, a serotype 9 rAAV expressing the Mut
cDNA was constructed and delivered to newborn Mut/ mice (n¼11). rAAV9 gene therapy directed hepatic transgene
expression within 24 h and effectively rescued the Mut/ mice from lethality, conferred long-term survival, markedly improved
metabolism and resulted in striking preservation of renal function and histology. Systemic readministration of the vector at a
dose similar to that used in human clinical trials (2.5109GC of rAAV9 per gram) to older, treated Mut/ mice (n¼5) lowered
circulating metabolites, increased in vivo propionate oxidative capacity and produced transgene expression in the kidney and
liver. Our data support the use of an rAAV9 vector in the acute and chronic treatment of MMA, and highlight the renal tropism
afforded by this novel serotype.

INTRODUCTION
Methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) is an autosomal recessive inborn
error of organic acid metabolism characterized by severe metabolic
instability, multiorgan pathology and a poor prognosis for long-term
survival.1–7 This disorder is most commonly caused by deficient
activity of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase,1 the 5¢-deoxyadenosylcobala￾min-dependent enzyme that isomerizes L-methylmalonyl-CoA into
succinyl-CoA in the mitochondrial inner space.
Current management approaches for vitamin B12 (hydroxoco￾balamin) non-responsive MMA patients include dietary restriction of
propiogenic amino acids, nutritional supplement administration and
vigilant monitoring. Liver or combined liver/kidney transplantation
have been used to treat those with the most severe clinical manifesta￾tions.8–17 Patients with MMA, even those who have received liver
transplants, can develop progressive renal dysfunction,11 pathologically
characterized by tubulointerstitial nephritis,18,19 and eventually require
kidney transplantation.20 Whether circulating metabolite(s) and/or a
cell intrinsic defect underlies the renal pathology of MMA remains
unknown.21 The disease manifestations seen in the patient population,
even those who have been intensively treated, demonstrate the need for
new therapies, ideally ones that could target both the liver and kidney,
to increase stability and protect from renal insufficiency.
We have previously demonstrated that a recombinant adeno￾associated virus serotype 8 (rAAV8) vector expressing the murine
Mut gene under the control of the cytomegalovirus enhancer/chicken
b-actin promoter could rescue newborn Mut/ mice from neonatal
lethality and provide long-term phenotypic correction.22 Although
neonatal rAAV8 gene therapy effectively targeted numerous tissues in
Mut/ mice, particularly the liver and skeletal muscle, transgene
expression was not detectable in the kidney and decreased in other
tissues over time. This suggests that translation to human subjects
would likely require multiple rounds of gene delivery throughout life.
Alternative rAAV vectors that could provide enhanced renal tropism
with the potential to be administered in the setting of an immune
response to rAAV8 may be required for effective gene therapy
application in humans.
AAV serotypes are numerous, exhibit distinct tissue tropism and
offer the potential for optimization of gene delivery to specific target
tissues and/or cell types.23,24 Among the naturally occurring adeno￾associated viruses isolated from simian and human tissues, serotype 9
has recently been recognized as superior in the ability to direct hepatic
and renal gene transfer in a mouse model of renal tubulointerstitial
fibrosis.25 These properties, coupled with previous studies showing
that rAAV9 vectors exhibit rapid and widespread transgene expression
in mice and larger animals,26–28 suggest that a serotype 9 rAAV vector
would be promising in gene therapy applications for MMA.25–31 To
explore the use of this novel serotype in the treatment of mice with
MMA, we developed and characterized an AAV serotype 9 vector,
rAAV9-CBA-mMut, to express Mut from the enhanced, chicken
b-actin promoter.32 Intrahepatic delivery of rAAV9-CBA-mMut
effectively rescued Mut/ mice from neonatal lethality, provided
immediate and persistent expression of the transgene, and after

low-dose systemic reinjection at 1 year, directed expression of the
transgene in the liver and kidney. These studies highlight the novel
characteristics of rAAV9-mediated gene delivery as a treatment for
MMA, particularly rapid transgene expression in vivo and tropism for
the kidney, an organ involved in the pathophysiology of many
hereditary and acquired disorders.
RESULTS
Gene therapy with low-dose AAV9 rescues the lethal Mut/
phenotype
Mut/ mice received a single dose of 11010 vector genome copies of
rAAV9-CBA-mMut by intrahepatic injection at birth (n¼11). While
two treated Mut/ mice died within the first 48 h, 82% of the mice
that received rAAV9-CBA-mMut gene therapy survived 1 year post
treatment (Figure 1). All of the untreated Mut/ mice died by day
of life 72, with more than 90% mortality occurring by day of life
24 (Figure 1). In contrast, at 1 year, 89% of the injected hetero￾zygous control littermates were alive. Deceased mice were autolysed,
cannibalized or entirely missing from their cages.
rAAV9 gene therapy vector leads to rapid and high-level expression
of the mutase transgene
To examine the expression kinetics of the viral transgene in the
immediate pre-injection period, livers from treated newborn Mut/
mice were collected at 24 and 72 h after treatment with either
11010GC of rAAV9-CBA-mMut or rAAV2-CBA-mMut, a serotype
that has well-studied uncoating properties in the murine liver.33
Untreated Mut+/ and Mut/ littermate livers were harvested in parallel
and served as controls. There was no detectable level of immunoreactive
mutase enzyme in untreated Mut/ mice (Figure 2). However, as early
as 24 h after injection, rAAV9-CBA-mMut-treated Mut/ mice demon￾strated hepatic Mut protein at levels similar to those seen in untreated
Mut+/ animals (Figure 2). By 72 h, Mut expression continued to
increase in the rAAV9-CBA-mMut-treated Mut/ mice (Figure 2).
In contrast, Mut was absent in Mut/ mice similarly treated with rAAV2-
CBA-mMut (Figure 2) at both times, demonstrating the influence of
the serotype and tropism on early transgene expression in the liver.
Growth improvement after gene therapy
Although untreated Mut/ and Mut+/ mice are indistinguishable at
birth, the rare Mut/ animals that survive neonatal lethality present
signs of severe growth retardation.34 By 2 months of age, untreated
Mut/ mice weigh less than one third as much as sex-matched
Mut+/ littermates, appear grossly abnormal and uniformly perish by
72 days.22 In contrast, Mut/ mice treated with rAAV9-CBA-mMut
were significantly larger than untreated Mut/ mice (Figure 3a;
***Po0.001). They appeared and behaved in an identical manner as
treated control littermates, but were slightly smaller than heterozygous
littermates, even after vector readministration (Supplementary
Figure 1). Furthermore, treated Mut/ mice thrive on a regular
diet, unlike untreated Mut/ mice that have to be maintained on a
high-fat and carbohydrate diet.
Restoration of Mut function and activity
In order to study the efficacy of gene therapy, we analyzed various
parameters that reflect the Mut enzymatic activity and function,
including metabolite concentrations and ability of the treated
Mut/ mice to oxidize 1-13C-sodium propionate into 13CO2.
Compared with controls, plasma MMA levels remained significantly
elevated at all times in the treated Mut/ mice, and stabilized at
323 mmol l1 (±30 mmol l1) by 1 year of life (Figure 3b).
Mice with functional hepatic Mut activity can oxidize 1-13C-sodium
propionate into 13CO2.
22 This activity is markedly reduced in
untreated Mut/ mice (Figure 3c). At 9 months, rAAV9-CBA￾mMut-treated Mut/ mice and heterozygous littermates were
injected with 1-13C-sodium propionate and breath samples were
collected while the CO2 production rate was measured. Mut+/
mice convert B50% of 1-13C-sodium propionate into 13CO2 in
25 min (n¼3) whereas untreated Mut/ mice (n¼6) oxidize only
B10% of the injected dose (Figure 3c). At 9 months post treatment,
1-13C-propionate oxidation was significantly increased above the
untreated state in the rAAV9-CBA-mMut-treated Mut/ mice
(n¼5; Figure 3c), demonstrating that the Mut transgene was
persistently expressed and functional in vivo.
rAAV9 gene therapy preserves the glomerular filtration rate and
kidney cytoarchitecture
Because human MMA patients suffer from kidney failure and previous
studies have established that older, untreated Mut/ mice exhibit
severe and widespread tubulointerstitial changes,34 we examined
the effect of gene therapy on kidney function and histology in the

rAAV9-CBA-mMut-treated Mut/ mice. The measured glomerular
filtration rate (GFR) did not significantly differ between the rAAV9-CBA￾mMut-treated Mut/ (n¼3) and Mut+/ mice (n¼3; Figure 3d). As the
untreated Mut/ littermates perish, GFR measurements values for
untreated, matched mutant controls are not available for comparison.
Kidney histology was next examined in rAAV9-CBA-mMut-treated
Mut/ mice (n¼6) and compared with Mut+/ littermates (n¼3).
Consistent with the GFR measurements, renal histology in the rAAV9-
CBA-mMut-treated Mut/ mice was unremarkable, without
characteristic tubulointerstitial changes, and appeared identical to
the rAAV9-CBA-mMut-treated Mut+/ control mice (Supplementary
Figure 2).
Low-dose systemic reinjection of rAAV9-CBA-mMut at 1 year results
in metabolic improvements and transgene expression in the kidney
One year after neonatal injection, a set of treated rAAV9-CBA-mMut
Mut/ mice (n¼5) were reinjected with a low dose of rAAV9-CBA￾mMut (2.5109GC gram1) delivered by the retro-orbital route.
Measurement of the concentration of methylmalonic acid in the
plasma, and whole-body 1-13C-sodium propionate oxidative capa￾city monitored the metabolic effects of reinjection. Within 3 days
after readministration of rAAV9-CBA-mMut, the plasma methyl￾malonic acid concentrations significantly decreased to 126 mM
(±11 mM; Po0.001) compared with pretreatment levels of 323 mM
(±30 mM; Figure 4a), and 1-13C-sodium propionate oxidative
capacity increased (Figure 4b). The extent of metabolic improve￾ment remained stable 1 month after reinjection, the plasma
methylmalonic acid was unchanged (Figure 4a) and 1-13C-sodium
propionate oxidation was equivalent between the reinjected rAAV9-
CBA-mMut Mut/ mice (n¼5) and heterozygote controls (n¼3;
Figure 4b).

1 year of age. After 1 year, the level of immunoreactive Mut in the liver
of a rAAV9-CBA-mMut-treated Mut/ mouse was similar to that
seen in an untreated Mut+/ control (Figure 4c), and showed
persistent expression at 1 and 2 months after reinjection with
rAAV9-CBA-mMut (Figure 4c). Mut was not present in a kidney
extract prepared from a Mut/ mouse that was treated only with a
single neonatal injection of rAAV9-CBA-mMut, but was readily
detected 1 month after systemic reinjection (Figure 4d). Further
analysis using quantitative PCR confirmed that Mut mRNA was
present in the kidney of the re-treated rAAV9-CBA-mMut Mut/
mice, but at levels well below those measured in heterozygous
littermates (data not shown). Western analysis using liver and kidney
extracts from reinjected rAAV9-CBA-mMut Mut/ mice were also
examined 2 months after reinjection and yielded similar results to
those seen at the earlier 1 month time point. This supports the
observation that there is Mut expression in the kidney following
systemic gene therapy with rAAV9-CBA-mMut (Figure 4d).
DISCUSSION
In this study, we demonstrate the efficacy of an rAAV9 vector to treat
MMA in a mouse model that replicates the features of severe human
disease. Consistent with reports showing that serotype 9 AAV vectors
are highly efficacious gene delivery agents in mice,26 we have achieved
long-term correction of the neonatal lethal phenotype seen in the
untreated Mut/ mice using a 10-fold lower dose than that pre￾viously used with rAAV8 vectors.22,35 Early and long-term transgene
expression, proven by expression of Mut gene in the liver of Mut/
mice as early as 24 h post treatment with persistence to 1 year and
beyond, likely contributes to the biological efficacy of this gene therapy
approach. The rescued Mut/ mice were vigorous and appeared
well, tolerated a non-restricted diet and had markedly improved
metabolic parameters compared with the untreated state. Like
patients who receive liver and combined liver/kidney transplants,8
the circulating metabolites were not normalized in the treated mice.

was measured and used to determine the percent of the administered 1-13C-propionate dose that was oxidized. Error bars surround the 95% confidence

prepared from Mut+/ and Mut/ mice after systemic readministration of rAAV9-CBA-mMut. In all, 30 mg of clarified whole-liver extracts was analyzed for
transgene expression by western blotting. The same membranes were probed with either anti-methylmalonyl-CoA mutase antibody (labeled Mut) or an anti￾ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase antibody (labeled complex III) to control for loading and mitochondrial content. Immunoreactive Mut enzyme is
present in the untreated Mut+/ extract, and in Mut/ mouse that was treated with rAAV9-CBA-mMut 1 year after neonatal injection (lane 4), 1 month after
reinjection (lane 5) and 2 months after reinjection (lanes 6 through 9). The mitochondrial loading control shows approximately the same intensity in each
sample. (d) Mut expression in kidney extracts prepared from Mut+/ and Mut/ mice after systemic readministration of rAAV9-CBA-mMut at 1 year of life.

exactly the same manner as for the liver extracts. Immunoreactive Mut enzyme is present in the untreated Mut+/ extract, but not in an untreated Mut/
animal (lane 3) or Mut/ mouse that was studied 1 year after receiving a single neonatal injection of rAAV9-CBA-mMut (lane 4). However, in the Mut/
mice that received a second injection of rAAV9-CBA-mMut 1 year after birth, immunoreactive enzyme was detected 1 month (lane 5) and 2 months (lanes 6,

endured throughout life, as the animals appeared and acted in a
manner identical to control littermates.
Recently, the potential of rAAV9 to transduce the kidney and
provide biological efficacy in a genetic mouse model of tubulointer￾stitial renal disease has been established.25 As kidney failure is a well￾recognized and devastating complication of MMA, we also examined
fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-inulin clearance in the treated
Mut/ mice to measure the GFR, a sensitive measure of renal function.
No significant differences were observed between Mut+/ and rAAV9-
CBA-mMut-treated Mut/ mice in our GFR study. Although the
manifestations of renal disease in mouse models of MMA are not
fully explored, previous studies have established that tubulointerstitial
nephritis, similar to what has been documented in MMA patients,
does occur in older, untreated Mut/ mice that escape lethality.34
In the small number of rAAV9-treated Mut/ mice that were killed
after GFR studies were performed at 1 year of age, renal histology
was similar to that seen in treated controls and showed no tubuloin￾terstitial changes (Figure 3d and Supplementary Figure 2). That
the treated Mut/ mice studied here tolerated a non-restricted
diet, have normal glomerular kidney function and have no evidence
of tubulointerstitial changes suggest that rAAV9 gene therapy has
ameliorated the progression of MMA-associated kidney damage,
either by transduction of a critical renal cellular element, such
as the proximal tubule, or by reducing the ‘nephrotoxic’ metabolite
load.
In light of the published data showing that rAAV9 can be read￾ministered and still mediate high levels of transgene expression,
even in the presence of neutralizing antibodies,36 a subset of treated
Mut/ mice were reinjected at 1 year of age. A dose of rAAV9-CBA￾mMut similar to that used in human clinical trials with other rAAVs
(2.5109GC gram1)37 was systemically delivered. As early as 3 days
post injection, the reinjected Mut/ mice exhibited improved
metabolism and the response persisted for at least 1 month post
treatment, despite the fact that the circulating metabolites remained
substantially increased in re-treated Mut/ mice. These findings
demonstrate that a second round of gene delivery can substantially
replenish Mut enzymatic activity in vivo and can be readily measured
using a combination of circulating and whole-body metabolic
parameters.
In order to determine whether a systemic rAAV9-CBA-mMut
readministration resulted in a greater transgene expression in the
liver and kidney, tissues were harvested 1 or 2 months after reinjection,
analyzed by western blotting and quantitative PCR, and the results
were compared with that of mice that had received only a single
rAAV9-CBA-mMut treatment at birth. Mut/ mice that received only
a single injection at birth had hepatic Mut protein levels comparable
to treated heterozygous littermates. In Mut/ mice that received a
second injection of rAAV9-CBA-mMut at 1 year, transgene expression
further increased in the liver (Figure 4c). Although one otherwise
asymptomatic treated Mut/ mouse had elevated LFTs before vector
readministration (Supplementary Figure 3) for an unknown reason,
liver function tests in the multiply treated animals did not reveal
AAV9-associated transaminitis. As rAAV9 has been reported to trans￾duce the kidney in mice,25,26 we next examined whole-kidney extracts
prepared from mice at 1 month and 2 months after systemic
reinjection. Immunoreactive enzyme was apparent in the Mut/
kidneys studied after re-treatment, compared with undetectable levels
present before reinjection. These data establish that a second injection
of rAAV9-CBA-mMut, systemically delivered at a dose equal to that
used in human trials for other AAV serotypes, resulted in significantly
increased Mut expression in both the liver and the kidney.
The studies presented here clearly demonstrate the therapeutic
potential of a serotype 9 rAAV vector to effectively deliver the Mut
gene in a mouse model of MMA that faithfully replicates the severe
human phenotype. The rapid hepatic transgene expression we have
documented in rAAV9-CBA-mMut-treated neonatal Mut/ mice
suggests that a rapidly uncoating rAAV vector33 might be used to
treat MMA patients acutely in the setting of metabolic decompensa￾tion, perhaps as early as the newborn period. Transduction of the liver,
and especially the kidney, further supports the consideration of AAV
serotype 9 gene therapy vectors for future use in the treatment of
patients with MMA.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Murine model of MMA
Mut/ mice contain a deletion of exon 3 in the methylmalonyl-CoA mutase
gene, display neonatal lethality and exhibit massive elevations of methylmalonic
acid in the blood, urine and tissues.38 Mut RNA, protein and enzymatic activity
are undetectable in Mut/ mice. Mut+/ mice have biochemical parameters
identical to Mut+/+ mice and were used as controls throughout the study.22,38
rAAV9 construction, production and delivery
The murine Mut cDNA was cloned into the pAAV2-CI-CB7-RBG expression
plasmid to generate rAAV9-CBA-mMut. pAAV2-CI-CB7-RBG contains the
transcriptional control elements from the cytomegalovirus enhancer/chicken
b-actin promoter, cloning sites for the insertion of a complementary DNA and
the rabbit b-globin polyA signal flanked by AAV2 terminal repeats.32 rAAVs
were subsequently packaged with either AAV9 or AAV2 capsid, purified by
cesium chloride centrifugation or column chromatography, and titered by
quantitative PCR as previously described.39 rAAV9-CBA-mMut had a titer
of 1.381012GC ml1; rAAV2-CBA-mMut had a titer of 5.521012GC ml1.
In all, 11010GC of the viral vector was delivered to neonatal mice via
intrahepatic injection immediately after birth.22 At 1 year of age, a subset of
mice that had been injected in the neonatal period were re-treated with
2.5109GC per gram body weight rAAV9-CBA-mMut delivered via
retro-orbital injection. The National Human Genome Research Institute
Animal User Committee approved all animal studies.
Western blotting
Tissue samples were homogenized in T-PER tissue protein extraction buffer
(Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL, USA) in the presence of Halt protease
inhibitor cocktail (Pierce Biotechnology) using a 2-ml Tenbroeck tissue grinder
(Wheaton, Millville, NJ, USA). Protein extracts were analyzed by western blot
and probed with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against the Mut enzyme.22
Mitochondrial loading control was detected with mouse monoclonal antibo￾dies against complex III core II (SKU# A-11143, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,
USA). The anti-Mut antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:1000 and the anti￾Complex III Core II antibody was used at a dilution of 1:3000. Horseradish
peroxidase–conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (NA934; GE Healthcare Life Sciences,
Piscataway, NJ, USA) or anti-mouse IgG (NA931; GE Healthcare Life Sciences)
were used as secondary antibodies and visualized after chemiluminescence
detection (Pierce Biotechnology).
Metabolic studies
Blood samples were collected from treated mice by orbital bleeding. Plasma was
isolated by centrifugation, diluted in water and stored at 801C in a screw-top
tube. Methylmalonic acid concentrations in plasma were measured by gas
chromatography–mass spectrometry.40,41 To determine 1-13C-propionate oxi￾dation in vivo, mice were placed into a respiratory chamber after intraperitoneal
injection of 200 mg of 1-13C-sodium propionate.22,42 Breath samples from
mutant, control and treated mice were collected at 5, 15 and 25 min after
injection and the isotope ratio (13C/12C) of the expired gas was measured with a
gas isotope ratio mass spectrometer (Metabolic Solutions, Nashua, NH, USA).
The percent dose oxidized at each time point was calculated as:
% dose oxidized ¼ total 13C excreted ðmmol=doseðmmolÞ100%Þ

Glomerular filtration rate
The GFR was measured using the FITC-labeled inulin clearance method.43
Experiments were performed on age- and sex-matched Mut+/ (n¼3) and
Mut/ mice (n¼3) at 1 year of age. All of the mice had received a single
neonatal intrahepatic injection of rAAV9-CBA-mMut. Under isoflurane
anesthesia, mice were given a single retro-orbital bolus injection of 5%
FITC-labeled inulin (3.74 ml per gram body weight). Heparinized serial blood
collections were performed from tail cuts at 3, 7, 10, 15, 35, 55 and 75 min after
inulin administration and the plasma was subsequently removed. As pH affects
FITC fluorescence values, each plasma sample was buffered by mixing 1 ml
plasma with 9 ml of 500 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid
solution (pH 7.4). The amount of FITC label present in the samples was then
measured using a fluorospectrometer at 538 nm emission (NanoDrop 3300,
Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE, USA). A two-compartment clearance model
was used to calculate the GFR. Plasma fluorescence data were fit to a two-phase
exponential decay curve using nonlinear regression (GraphPad Prism, GraphPad
Software, San Diego, CA, USA). GFR (ml min1) was calculated using the
equation: GFR¼I/(A/a+B/b). I is the amount of FITC-inulin delivered by
injection, A and B are the y-intercept values of the two decay rates, and a and b
are the decay constants for the distribution and elimination phases, respectively.
Statistical analyses
Differences in the survival between treated and untreated groups were analyzed
using a w2-test. Differences in weight, metabolite levels and GFRs were assessed
using a Student’s t-test. The Kruskal–Wallis test was used to determine the
statistical significance in measured propionate oxidation rates between groups
at 25 min after injection. P-values o0.05 were considered significant.
