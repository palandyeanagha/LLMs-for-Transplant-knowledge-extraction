Abstract
Background: Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) covers a spectrum of rare congenital anomalies characterised
by a non-apex forming left ventricle and stenosis/atresia of the mitral and aortic valves. Despite many studies, the
causes of HLHS remain unclear and there are conflicting views regarding the role of flow, valvar or myocardial
abnormalities in its pathogenesis, all of which were proposed prior to the description of the second heart field. Our aim
was to re-evaluate the patterns of malformation in HLHS in relation to recognised cardiac progenitor populations, with a
view to providing aetiologically useful sub-groupings for genomic studies.
Results: We examined 78 hearts previously classified as HLHS, with subtypes based on valve patency, and re-categorised
them based on their objective ventricular phenotype. Three distinct subgroups could be identified: slit-like left ventricle
(24%); miniaturised left ventricle (6%); and thickened left ventricle with endocardial fibroelastosis (EFE; 70%). Slit-like
ventricles were always found in combination with aortic atresia and mitral atresia. Miniaturised left ventricles all had
normally formed, though smaller aortic and mitral valves. The remaining group were found to have a range of aortic
valve malformations associated with thickened left ventricular walls despite being described as either atresia or stenosis.
The degree of myocardial thickening was not correlated to the degree of valvar stenosis. Lineage tracing in mice to
investigate the progenitor populations that form the parts of the heart disrupted by HLHS showed that whereas Nkx2–5-
Cre labelled myocardial and endothelial cells within the left and right ventricles, Mef2c-AHF-Cre, which labels second
heart field-derived cells only, was largely restricted to the endocardium and myocardium of the right ventricle. However,
like Nkx2–5-Cre, Mef2c-AHF-Cre lineage cells made a significant contribution to the aortic and mitral valves. In contrast,
Wnt1-Cre made a major contribution only to the aortic valve. This suggests that discrete cardiac progenitors might be
responsible for the patterns of defects observed in the distinct ventricular sub-groups.
Conclusions: Only the slit-like ventricle grouping was found to map to the current nomenclature: the combination of
mitral atresia with aortic atresia. It appears that slit-like and miniature ventricles also form discrete sub-groups. Thus,
reclassification of HLHS into subgroups based on ventricular phenotype, might be useful in genetic and developmental
studies in investigating the aetiology of this severe malformation syndrome.

Background
Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) is the term ap￾plied by Noonan and Nadas [1] to a range of rare congeni￾tal malformations initially described by Lev [2], which are
characterised by a non-apex forming left ventricle and a
narrowed ascending aorta. Additional key features of mi￾tral and aortic valve atresia or stenosis provide the basis of
a descriptive clinical classification. Exclusion criteria in￾clude double outlet right ventricle, atrioventricular septal
defects and large ventricular septal defects [3]. Despite im￾proved survival since the introduction of staged uni￾ventricular surgical repair by Norwood [4] the aetiology of
HLHS still remains unclear. Non-genetic causes, such as
solvent exposure [5], viral infection [6] and disturbances
of intra-cardiac blood flow [7] have been suggested. Based
on its familial recurrence, a genetic component has been
recognised [8–10] but genome-wide association studies
(GWAS) have not yielded novel candidate genes [11].
Similarly, a small number of well-known genes involved in
cardiogenesis, such as GJA1 [12, 13], HAND1 [14, 15],
NOTCH1 [16], NKX2–5 [15, 17] and GATA4 [15] have
been suggested but have not been confirmed as being sig￾nificant causes of HLHS.
In contrast to the limited progress in finding the
causes of HLHS, there has been a revolution in our
understanding of cardiac morphogenesis since the de￾scription of the second heart field (SHF) in 2001. The
previous theory proposing segmental patterning within
the primitive heart tube was an attractive one, not least
because it apparently explained many heart defects in￾cluding HLHS. We now know it to be incorrect. Instead,
it is recognised that a single atrial and ventricular cham￾ber are initially formed from the first heart field (FHF),
but that consequent addition of cells from the surround￾ing SHF produce parts of the atria, the right ventricle
and the outflow tract (reviewed in [18]). Studies using
knockout and transgenic mice have indicated the im￾portance of other multipotent progenitor populations in
forming the heart including: neural crest cells; mesen￾chymal cells formed by endothelial to mesenchymal
transformation (EndoMT); smooth muscle cells and fi￾broblasts derived by epithelial to mesenchymal trans￾formation (EMT) from the epicardium (reviewed in
[19]). It is an appropriate moment, therefore, to re￾evaluate HLHS from a developmental perspective.
In this study, we take a novel approach to understand￾ing HLHS, initially by reviewing the intra-cardiac
morphology of hearts appropriately coded as HLHS,
looking specifically for patterns of abnormalities that
would correlate with disturbance of known developmen￾tal processes. Then, using genetic lineage tracing with
Cre-lox mice, we ask if the features of HLHS subtypes
can be adequately explained by abnormalities attribut￾able to specific progenitor populations. We demonstrate
three discrete ventricular phenotypes, but note that these
are associated with a broad range of abnormalities affect￾ing the aortic and mitral valves suggesting that HLHS may
be the result of distinct developmental sequences. In some
situations, valvar abnormalities might be the initiating
abnormality, whilst in others the primary issue most likely
lies in abnormal endocardial or myocardial growth or sig￾nalling. This study indicates how the heterogeneity of
phenotype in HLHS can be grouped in studies aiming to
explain the pathogenesis of HLHS.
Methods
Archival hearts
The congenitally malformed heart archive at Birming￾ham Children’s Hospital contains approximately 2000
specimens collected since 1939. Permission to study the
collection was granted by the R&D department at
Birmingham Children’s Hospital NHS Foundation Trust
and the Custodian Committee of the collection. Seventy￾eight un-operated hearts, in good condition and fulfilling
the accepted criteria for HLHS [3], were identified. The
hearts had been already prosected, fixed and stored in
formalin; it was not permissible to undertake further
prosection. Demographic data such as age and sex were
not available. Measurements of the hearts were made
using Vernier callipers (Fisher Scientific), with photog￾raphy carried out using a digital single lens reflex camera
with macroscopic lens (Nikon 3100, Nikon, Japan) or
stereomicroscope (MZ16, Leica, Germany).
Animals
Mef2c-AHF-Cre, Wnt1-Cre, Nkx2–5-Cre, and Tie2-Cre
[20–23] mice, together with ROSAeYFP and mTmG re￾porter lines were used in these experiments. Specificity
of expression of these Cre drivers in our hands has been
confirmed in previous studies [24, 25]. The studies were
approved by the Newcastle University Animal Welfare
and Ethical Review Board and conformed to the Animals
(Scientific) Act 1986 (UK) and Directive 2010/63/EU of
the European Parliament.
Staining and immunohistochemistry
Mouse embryos were collected at embryonic (E) days
10.5 and E15.5. Immunohistochemistry was carried out
as described previously [24, 26]. Alexa 488 or Alexa 594
(Life Technologies) secondary antibodies were used for
immunofluorescence. Images were acquired using an
Axioimager II and Apotome II (Zeiss, Jena, DE).
Statistics
Comparisons were made using ANOVA (SPSS 14.0, IBM)
assuming non-parametric distributions. Post Hoc testing
with Dunn’s test allowed for unequal group size.

Results
Based on macroscopic examination and probe patency,
we sub-classified 78 hearts with a previous diagnosis of
HLHS (Fig. 1), focussing on the ventricular phenotype.
All hearts had normal arrangements and connections
between the atria, ventricles and great vessels. The right
ventricles and connected valves were normal and in all
cases a patent foramen ovale guarded by a patulous,
probe patent, flap valve was found. It was not possible to
reliably identify the attachment of the pulmonary veins
or the presence of persisting left-sided superior caval
veins due to previous dissection.
Three distinct subgroups of left ventricular phenotype
Examination of the left ventricles in HLHS specimens
revealed three different appearances (Fig. 2). A distinct￾ive subset, that we labelled as “slit-like ventricle”, was
seen in 19/78 (24%) hearts and was characterised by a
flattened left ventricle contained within the left-posterior
aspect of the ventricular mass. The presence of the ven￾tricle was suggested by delimiting coronary vessels and
in all 19 hearts, a cross sectional incision revealed a thin
parietal left ventricular wall and a slit-like cavity. All of
these hearts had mitral atresia and aortic atresia (MA/
AA, Fig. 2a, d, h, i). In contrast, the left ventricles in 5/
78 (6%) hearts were almost normal in size and mural
thickness, but did not form the cardiac apex (Fig. 2b, h, i).
Although smaller than their right-sided counterparts, the
aortic and mitral valves were anatomically normal. The
remaining 54 hearts (70%) had a small left ventricular
cavity, with the right ventricle forming the apex to the
heart, but their left ventricular walls were markedly thick￾ened (Fig. 2c, h, i). Of this group with “thickened parietal
walls” 35/54 of these hearts were classified as examples of
mitral stenosis/aortic stenosis (MS/AS), whilst 19/54 were
considered as exhibiting mitral stenosis and aortic atresia
(MS/AA; Fig. 2). Endocardial fibroelastosis (EFE), recog￾nisable as a firm and pitted layer on the left ventricular
endothelial surface, was present in 50/54 hearts with a
thickened left ventricular parietal wall (Fig. 2e), but was
not found in any of the hearts with slit-like or minia￾turised left ventricles. Notably, although length of the left
ventricle relative to the right ventricle was not a useful
measure (Fig. 2h), the thickness of the left ventricular
parietal wall (Fig. 2i) was a more pronounced method of
distinguishing between the subgroups, particularly in
combination with the presence or absence of EFE.
Aortic and mitral valve phenotypes overlap between the
three ventricular subgroups
We next examined the aortic and mitral valves in more
detail, relating them with the ventricular phenotypes as
described above. Of the 24 hearts with aortic stenosis,
all five with miniaturised ventricles contained remark￾ably large and well-formed aortic valves with three thin
leaflets (Fig. 3a). The remaining 19/24 hearts with aortic
stenosis had thick left ventricular walls and contained
small and/or abnormal aortic valves (Fig. 3b, c, k). There
were 54/78 hearts with aortic atresia and 19/54 of these
had slit-like left ventricles. In 16/19 of these hearts it
was not possible to identify the aortic valve (arrow in
Fig. 4a), although a small area of white fibrous tissue
was seen at the anticipated site of the leaflets in 2/19.
Small, imperforate bicuspid leaflets were seen in the last
case. No aortic valvar tissue could be found in the 28/35
of the remaining aortic atresia hearts with thickened
ventricular wall. In the remaining 7/35 there was either
an area of fibrous tissue (Fig. 3d, e) or fused valve
leaflets. It was not possible to distinguish unicuspid from
bicuspid valves with certainty, but the sizes of the im￾perforate valve were proportionate to the size of the
aortic root.
Although a range of abnormalities was seen in the mi￾tral valves, there was a general relationship between the
size of papillary muscles, length of tendinous chords and
the degree of leaflet formation. The largest valves with
well-formed thin leaflets, fine separate tendinous cords,
and prominent papillary muscles, were found in the five
hearts with miniaturised ventricles (MS/AS) (Fig. 3g, k).
In 15/19 of the hearts with slit-like ventricles (MA/AA),
the mitral valves were either absent or represented by a
small nodule of white tissue (Fig. 3f ). The remaining 4/
19 slit-like ventricles contained identifiable mitral valve
structures. In three cases, they were either small or

dysplastic, although in one the valve was of moderate
size, but with fused leaflets. The remaining 35 hearts
with aortic atresia had thickened left ventricular walls.
They exhibited a wide range of mitral valve appearances
including moderate sized valves with cords but usually
no papillary muscles; smaller valves with thin leaflets,
small cords, and no papillary muscles; and thickened or
nodular dysplastic valves (Fig. 3h-k). There was some
correlation between aortic and mitral valve appearances.
The hearts with miniaturised ventricles tended to con￾tain the largest and relatively best-formed mitral and
aortic valves (Fig. 3g, k), whereas the hearts with slit-like
ventricles contained the most rudimentary of valvar ap￾pearances (Fig. 3f, k). In general, the malformation of
the aortic valve was more severe than that of the accom￾panying mitral valve (Fig. 3k).
The ascending aorta dimensions relate to flow through
the aortic valve
The ascending aorta was narrow in comparison to the
pulmonary trunk in all the hearts (Fig. 4). The ratio of
the aorta:pulmonary trunk hemi-circumference (Ao:PT
ratio) appeared to reflect the likelihood and magnitude
of forward flow through this segment. Thus, the smallest
dimensions were seen in hearts with MA/AA (Fig. 4a),
with the collapsed left ventricular chamber indicative of
absence of any appreciable forward-flow through the as￾cending aorta. This was followed by the group with MS/

(median and interquartile range). However, the miniature ventricles had
longer ventricular cavities. i The LV/RV wall ratio in slit-like ventricles was
reduced in comparison with other groups. Hearts with mitral stenosis/
aortic atresia and mitral stenosis/mitral stenosis demonstrated LV wall
thickening of similar extent. The LV and RV wall thicknesses were equal
in hearts with miniaturised ventricles. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01,

AA (Fig. 4b, c). In contrast, the hearts with miniaturised
left ventricles and (mild) MS/AS had the largest aortic seg￾ments, in keeping with their large valves and relatively
well-formed left ventricular chambers. The remaining
hearts with thickened ventricles fell between these groups
(Fig. 4b). Paraductal coarctation was also commonly seen
in these hearts (Fig. 4d). However, it was not possible to ac￾curately determine the frequency of this as in many cases
the historical dissection of the aorta and ductus arteriosus
had confused the positioning of these ductal spillages.
Lineage contributions to the ventricles in the context of
HLHS
To investigate the developmental mechanisms underpin￾ning the miniaturised, slit-like, and thickened with EFE
categories of HLHS described above, we used Cre-lox
based lineage tracing in transgenic mice to determine
the progenitor contributions and developmental pro￾cesses common to the left-sided structures of the heart,
focussing on stages prior to and following cardiac sept￾ation (embryonic day (E) 10.5 and E15.5 respectively).
Discrimination of FHF cells from SHF cells was per￾formed by comparing the expression patterns of GFP
reporter constructs in transgenic mice containing
Nkx2–5-Cre that identifies all cardiomyocytes [22], with
that generated using Mef2c-AHF-Cre, which specifically
labels SHF-derived cardiomyocytes [20]. At E10.5,
whilst Nkx2–5-Cre identified cardiomyocytes in the
right and left atria and ventricles (Fig. 5a, c), Mef2c￾AHF-Cre was restricted to the myocardium of the right
ventricle and outflow tract, together with a region in
the roof of the right atrium (Fig. 5b, d). The Tie2-Cre
transgene labels all endocardium ([23]; Fig. 5e, g),
whilst in contrast, Mef2c-AHF-Cre labels only SHF￾derived endocardium (Fig. 5f, h). As with the myocar￾dium, SHF-derived endothelial cells predominated in

the right ventricle and outflow vessels (including the
mature aorta), with very few Mef2c-AHF-Cre-labelled
endocardial cells seen in the left ventricle (Fig. 5i, j; this
was the only labelled patch of Mef2c-AHF-Cre labelled
cells in the LV, found in the parietal wall, close to the
mitral valve).
Lineage contributions to the aortic and mitral valves in
the context of HLHS
Mef2c-AHF-Cre labelling showed that leaflets of both
the mitral and aortic valves had an endothelial covering
and contained interstitial cells of SHF-derived endothe￾lial origin, that had undergone EndoMT (Fig. 6c, d;
[23]). Cells within both the mitral and aortic valve were
also identified by lineage tracing with Mef2c-AHF-Cre,
indicating that the SHF makes a contribution to these
endocardial-derived cells (Fig. 6c, d). Although Wnt1-
Cre-labelled neural crest cells [21] were also abundant in
the aortic valve and ascending aorta (Fig. 6e, f, h) there
were none in the left ventricle. However, close examin￾ation of the mitral valve revealed a few cells derived
from this lineage (Fig. 6e).
Discussion
Whilst heterogeneity of phenotype in HLHS is accepted
[27] the possibility that HLHS is a collection of entirely
separate entities has not, to the best of our knowledge,
been mooted. In this study, which represents the
spectrum of disease from the slit-like ventricle with
MA/AA to the miniaturised left ventricle with mild MS/
AS, we have shown how the conventional valve-based
classification can be mapped to three distinctly different
left ventricular phenotypes (Fig. 7). Furthermore, the pa￾rameters of wall thickness, LV cavity length and macro￾scopic evidence of EFE support this alternative view.
This leads us to new hypotheses within the subgroups
that are potentially testable and informative of aetiology.
For example, it is possible that the slit-like ventricles
arise due to a combined primary defect in the mitral and
aortic valves. This then results in secondary failure of
left ventricular development due to absent blood flow,
combining a primary abnormality in valve development
with the “no flow, no grow” hypothesis. Alternatively,
the primary issue may lie in endothelial and/or myocar￾dial signalling pathways promoting growth. This directs
investigation towards understanding the nature of the
fetal left ventricular myocardium in HLHS, both in slit￾like ventricles and in those with thickened parietal walls,
at early stages prior to secondary changes. Limited histo￾logical analyses have shown myofibrillar disarray in the
thickened ventricular walls [28], but other studies have
suggested common senescent changes [29]. Such early
fetal samples, taken before secondary changes have be￾come established are rare, but do occur. The timing of
developmental aberrations also appears to be important
in HLHS. Completion of ventricular septation prior to
development of the valvar abnormalities may be an es￾sential feature in the formation of the collapsed, slit-like
ventricle in MA/AA [7], rather than leading to isolated
mitral atresia with ventricular septal defect and

maintained ventricular cavity volume. Ventricular sept￾ation is an early event, taking place in the 7th week of
human embryonic development, thus placing the patho￾logical mechanism underlying slit-like ventricle within a
limited time window. In contrast, pre-natal diagnosis
indicates that the thickened and miniaturised ventricular
phenotypes can appear at different stages during the
second and third trimester of pregnancy. These hearts
exhibited a wide variety of aortic root and valve
appearances. Some aortic valves were remarkably normal
but within small roots, whereas others demonstrated
markedly abnormal leaflets. This latter group may relate
more strongly to familial aortic valve disease [9]. The
hearts with miniaturised left ventricles, examples of the
hypoplastic left heart complex [30], with only mildly￾affected valve structures again form a phenotypically dis￾tinct group, The phenotype in this case is more in keep￾ing with a generalised subtle limitation of growth of the
left side of the heart, which could be due to endothelial
sensing, communication or myocardial response. Thus,
at this time, it appears that the slit-like ventricle, which
fully maps to MA/AA, represents the most homoge￾neous group and therefore most suitable for initial gen￾omic analyses. If genetic findings in this group can then
be confirmed or otherwise in the other phenotypes this
will be important in understanding pathogenesis and
refining classification. It should be noted that all of the

hearts examined here had probe-patent unrestricted
intra-atrial communication and normal right-sided
structures. This may be because the anatomical collec￾tion used in this study is biased to configurations that
allowed initial postnatal survival. With this caveat, it is
possible that other distinct sub-types might be present,
that these additional features are variations based on the
developmental sequence, or that they represent the ef￾fects of modifying mutations. In any event, identification
of genetic pathways causing the principle ventricular
HLHS phenotypes should clarify this. Similarly, we did
not note macroscopic evidence of sinusoidal connections
between the left ventricular cavity and coronary circula￾tion [31], although this may have been apparent if histo￾logical examination was undertaken.
This study has emphasised the limitation of EFE to
thickened ventricles, hearts conventionally described as
severe MS/AS and MS/AA. Although sub-myocardial is￾chaemia has been proposed as a cause of EFE, analysis
of coronary vasculature in HLHS has not supported this
proposal [32, 33]. Recent studies have suggested that
EFE results from excessive or ectopic endocardial to
mesenchymal transformation [34, 35]. It is unclear
whether this is therefore a specific element in the patho￾genesis of this phenotype, in contrast to the miniaturised
or slit-like ventricles, or represents a situation where
there is reduced but present flow, signalling EFE
formation as a secondary response. Our data suggests
that the degree of ventricular wall thickening in the
HLHS hearts did not correlate with the presence of aor￾tic stenosis versus atresia, suggesting that these features
are not directly linked. A correlation was seen between
the diameter of the ascending aorta and aortic valve pa￾tency however, as has been described previously [36]. Al￾though a significant role for flow in the growth of the
ascending aorta has been suggested, and demonstrated
in manipulations of embryonic circulation [7], the find￾ing that the reduction in aortic dimensions in the minia￾turised hearts was similar to that in hearts with
thickened and extremely diminished left ventricular cav￾ities was unexpected. The atretic ascending aortic seg￾ment develops from the aortic sac and shares SHF
endothelial and smooth muscle contributions with the
aortic root and valve. This raises the possibility that
there may a developmental failure in growth of the as￾cending aorta in HLHS subgroups, that has not been
distinguished from growth failure due to reduced flow.
To explore these concepts of embryonic origins further,
we carried out a developmental analysis using Cre-lox
based lineage tracing in mice. Mice are considered to be
the best animal model for studying congenital heart dis￾ease on account of their close similarity in structure and
developmental processes to human embryos. Indeed,
where differences exist, they are associated with atrial and

venous structures [37]. Recently, HLHS has been
described in mice [38] although these mutant animals did
not conform to the accepted human classifications [3], all
presenting with double outlet right ventricle in combin￾ation with small left ventricles and hypoplastic aortas.
Cre-lox technology has played a crucial role in uncovering
the complex developmental roles of different cell lineages
during heart development [18, 19]. The lines that we have
utilised label all cardiomyocytes (Nkx2–5-Cre), second
heart field-derived cells (Mef2c-AHF-Cre), endocardial
cells (Tie2-Cre) and neural crest cells (Wnt1-Cre) [20–23]
and were selected because they are reliable and reprodu￾cible and have been widely used, including by us, to inves￾tigate the roles of specific genes in these lineages (for
example, [24, 25]). Although not analysed in our study,
the epicardium is also an important cell population that
contributes cells to the ventricular wall and atrioventricu￾lar valves, although no differences in distribution over the
ventricular surfaces have been described [39]. Thus, there
are a range of cell types that could be responsible for the
phenotypes seen in HLHS. Our data supports the idea that
some aspects of HLHS are likely to represent a develop￾mental sequence rather than a co-existing series of
primary defects [27]. Thus, in cases where there are iso￾lated aortic valve abnormalities associated with thickened
left ventricular parietal wall and EFE, an anomaly in the
SHF or NCC cell types is extremely plausible, as these cell
types make significant contributions to the forming aortic
valve. Alternatively in other hearts in this same group it is
possible that a primary myocardial (FHF) dysfunction
could lead to myocardial thickening and secondary failure
of aortic valve development consequent on reduced flow.
In slit-like ventricles, the absence of normal mitral devel￾opment, with or without normal aortic valve development,
could lead to the collapsed left ventricle as these struc￾tures are adjacent in the early heart, abutting the inner
curvature. The miniaturised ventricle phenotype supports
the likelihood of a generalised anomaly in growth of the left
side of the heart, involving both FHF-derived left ventricu￾lar endothelium and/or myocardium, as well as SHF￾derived aortic endothelium. It seems unlikely that abnor￾malities in either the SHF or NCC could explain the pheno￾type in these hypoplastic left heart complex cases, and may
explain why many succeed with biventricular repair [30].
Conclusions
The new classification proposed in this study is not
intended to replace conventional descriptions that are based
on the valvar pathology. The conventional classification of
HLHS has important clinical implications. For example,
hearts with mitral stenosis and aortic atresia are associated
with adverse clinical outcome due to sinusoidal connections
between the coronary circulation and the left ventricular
cavity [31, 40]. However, developmentally expressed genes
can be restricted to first and second heart field lineages, as
well as left and right-sided structures (reviewed in [19]). We
suggest that the investigation of candidate HLHS genes
suggested via genomic studies, should be studied within the
context of progenitor contributions to specific affected
structures. HLHS subgroups with a strong inheritance
pattern may result from multigenic inheritance [9] or alter￾natively a simpler Mendelian inheritance complicated by
incomplete penetrance and, as noted in previous studies,
difficulties with heterogeneity of case selection [11].
