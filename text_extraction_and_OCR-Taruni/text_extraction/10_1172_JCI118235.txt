Abstract
Blood pressure, heart rate, sympathetic nerve activity, and
polysomnography were recorded during wakefulness and
sleep in 10 patients with obstructive sleep apnea. Measure￾ments were also obtained after treatment with continuous
positive airway pressure (CPAP) in four patients. Awake
sympathetic activity was also measured in 10 age- and sex￾matched control subjects and in 5 obese subjects without a
history of sleep apnea.
Patients with sleep apnea had high levels of nerve activ￾ity even when awake (P < 0.001). Blood pressure and sym￾pathetic nerve activity did not fall during any stage of sleep.
Mean blood pressure was 92±4.5 mmHg when awake and
reached peak levels of 116±5 and 127±7 mmHg during
stage II sleep (n = 10) and rapid eye movement (REM)
sleep (n = 5), respectively (P < 0.001). Sympathetic activity
increased during sleep (P = 0.01) especially during stage
II (133+9% above wakefulness; P = 0.006) and REM
(141±13%; P = 0.007). Peak sympathetic activity (mea￾sured over the last 10 s of each apneic event) increased to
299+96% during stage H sleep and to 246±36% during
REM sleep (both P < 0.001). CPAP decreased sympathetic
activity and blood pressure during sleep (P < 0.03).
We conclude that patients with obstructive sleep apnea
have high sympathetic activity when awake, with further
increases in blood pressure and sympathetic activity during
sleep. These increases are attenuated by treatment with
CPAP. (J. Clin. Invest. 1995. 96:1897-1904.) Key words:

Introduction
Patients with obstructive sleep apnea are at increased risk for
hypertension, myocardial ischemia, and stroke ( 1-5 ), and have
an increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality (6, 7).
They also have a high incidence of electrocardiographic changes
suggestive of ischemia during sleep; these changes are largely

Autonomic and hemodynamic responses to obstructive sleep
apnea (9) are complex and include the effects of apnea, hyp￾oxia, hypercapnia, the Mueller maneuver (inspiration against
a closed glottis), and arousal. Hypoxia and hypercapnia act
synergistically to increase sympathetic activity (10, 11); this
increase is especially marked during apnea when the sympa￾thoinhibitory influence of the pulmonary afferents is eliminated
(12, 13).
Sleep, by contrast, is associated with a marked decline in
both blood pressure and sympathetic activity during non-rapid
eye movement (REM) sleep (14-16). Thus, chemoreflex-me￾diated sympathetic excitation and blood pressure increases dur￾ing apneic episodes ( 17) might be opposed by sympathoinhibi￾tory and blood pressure-lowering mechanisms that govern non￾REM sleep.
To investigate the net effect of these opposing autonomic
and hemodynamic influences, we measured blood pressure,
heart rate, and sympathetic nerve activity during wakefulness
and sleep in patients with obstructive sleep apnea. We also
examined the effects of treatment with CPAP.
Methods
We studied 18 patients (14 males, 4 females) referred for evaluation
of sleep apnea. Informed written consent was obtained from each sub￾ject. These studies were approved by the institutional Human Use Com￾mittee. Technically excellent recordings of sympathetic activity during
wakefulness and sleep were obtained in 10 subjects (7 males, 3 females;
age - 45±12 yr). Patient characteristics are described in Table I. Stud￾ies were abandoned in six subjects because of inability to obtain nerve
recordings (n = 3) or instability of nerve recordings during the early
stages of sleep (n = 3). Two subjects did not have obstructive sleep
apnea. Recordings during wakefulness were also obtained in 10 age￾and sex-matched control subjects. These subjects denied symptoms of
obstructive sleep apnea, were free of significant medical illness, and
were on no medications, except for one subject with glaucoma (on
Timolol eye drops). Volunteers of the same sex and of similar age
to patients with obstructive sleep apnea underwent microneurographic
recordings of sympathetic nerve activity. If a successful nerve recording
was obtained, these subjects then underwent polysomnography to rule
out significant sleep apnea (i.e., apnea-hypopnea index > 10). We
also obtained measurements of sympathetic activity and blood pressure
during sleep in three of these control subjects. In addition, we obtained
measurements of sympathetic activity during wakefulness in five obese
subjects, who were free of symptoms suggestive of obstructive sleep
apnea.
Experimental methods and data analysis were similar to those used
in an earlier study on sleep in normal subjects (16). Studies started at
about 10 p.m. and finished at about 4 a.m. Sympathetic nerve activity

was measured using direct multiunit intraneural recordings of efferent
sympathetic discharge to muscle blood vessels (microneurography) (18,
19). A tungsten microelectrode (shaft diameter 200 ttM and tip of 1-
5 1.M) was inserted into the sympathetic nerve fascicles in the peroneal
nerve posterior to the fibular head. A reference electrode was inserted
subcutaneously - 3 cm away. Electrical signals obtained from the sym￾pathetic nerve fascicles were amplified (50,000-90,000 times), filtered
(bandpass filter, band width of 700-2,000 Hz), and passed through a
resistance-capacitance integrating network with a time constant of 0.1
s, providing a mean voltage display of sympathetic nerve activity. Sym￾pathetic bursts were identified by inspection of the mean voltage neuro￾gram, and sympathetic activity was calculated as bursts per minute, and
bursts per 100 heart beats, and by measurements of total burst amplitude
per minute, expressed as arbitrary units (19). Measurements of bursts
per 100 heart beats allows a comparison of baseline sympathetic nerve
activity levels between subjects (20-25).
Measurements of sympathetic nerve activity were normalized so that
the mean value for wakefulness was 100%. Measurements of nerve
activity for the different sleep stages were expressed as a percentage of
the values for wakefulness (16). Measurements of nerve activity during
sleep were made throughout a given sleep stage (overall nerve activity)
as well as during the last 10 s of each apneic event during a given sleep
stage (peak nerve activity).
Heart rate was measured using an electrocardiogram. Continuous
measurements of beat-by-beat blood pressure were obtained by intraart￾erial measurement (n 3) or using the Finapres system (26). Measure￾ments obtained using this system have been shown to correspond closely
to intraarterial blood pressure measurements both at rest and during rapid
changes in blood pressure (27). Subjects were fitted with a Finapres cuff
appropriate to finger size. The recording atm position was fixed with
the aid of sand bags and an arm board. The Finapres was switched off
for - 5- 10 min every 2 h for subject comfort.
Complete polysomnographic recordings were obtained including ox￾ygen saturation, nasal and oral air flow (measured by temperature￾sensitive thermocouples), chest movement, electromyogram, electroen￾cephalogram, and electrocardiogram. All variables in this study were
recorded continuously. Severity of sleep apnea was defined on the basis
of the apnea-hypopnea index. Apnea refers to cessation of both nasal
and oral airflow, and hypopnea refers to a reduction in airflow to < 50%
of baseline in association with oxygen desaturation. To be considered
significant, abnormal respiratory events had to persist for a maximum
of 10 s or had to occur in association with an arousal and/or a decrease
in oxygen saturation by 3% or more. Obstruction was confirmed by
persistent respiratory effort recorded by thoracic-abdominal strain
gauge and the electromyogram. The apnea-hypopnea index indicates
the number of respiratory irregularities per sleep hour and is calculated
as follows (28): (total number of apneas + hypopneas)/(total sleep
time in minutes) X 60/1. An index of <5 is normal, 5-20 suggests
mild sleep apnea, 20-50 is moderate, and >50 indicates severe sleep
apnea.
Sleep stages were scored based on the recommendations of Re￾chtstaffen and Kales (29). Normal sleep consists of REM and non￾REM sleep. Non-REM sleep is further subdivided into stages I, II, III,
and IV, indicating progressively deeper levels of sleep and characterized
by progressively slower frequency and increased voltage activity on the
electroencephalogram. REM sleep is characterized by the onset of low
voltage mixed frequency activity on the electroencephalogram, associ￾ated with loss of muscle tone and intermittent discrete episodes of rapid
eye movements (30-32).
Because of frequent and often continuously repetitive apneic epi￾sodes, all subjects exhibited brief arousals from sleep on termination of
apnea. The arousals prevented progression to deeper sleep stages in five
subjects, who remained in stage II sleep for prolonged periods. Four
subjects progressed to stages HI, IV, and REM sleep. Because of fre￾quent momentary arousals secondary to apneic episodes, it was not
possible to clearly separate stages III and IV sleep and these stages
were analyzed together and are referred to as stage IV sleep. In one
subject, REM sleep, with persistence of obstructive apneas, was
achieved after administration of low grade CPAP at 6 mmHg and lasted
only 5 min. Thus, measurements for stage I and II sleep were obtained
in all 10 subjects, for stage IV sleep in 4 subjects, and for REM sleep in
5 subjects. Duration of sleep during which complete data were obtained
averaged 2.4+0.4 h per subject. In four subjects with moderate to severe
obstructive sleep apnea, measurements were also taken during therapeu￾tic levels of CPAP administered the same night. Duration of recordings
during CPAP administration averaged 2.1±0.5 h per subject.
Data were analyzed from 4-min periods of wakefulness, stage II,
stage IV, and REM sleep (16). Because of the shorter duration of stage
I sleep, 2-min periods of this stage were analyzed. Three randomly
selected 4-min epochs (2-min epochs for stage I) were analyzed for
each of these sleep stages. Thus, for each subject, measurement for each
of wakefulness, stage II, stage IV, and REM was calculated from a total
of 12 min of measurement for each stage in each subject (6 min for
stage I). The exception was in the one subject in whom REM sleep
lasted only 5 min. Thus, only one 4-min epoch could be obtained during
REM sleep for this subject.
Sympathetic nerve recordings remained remarkably stable through
the night despite the arousals, and segments of data analyzed were
interrupted by minor adjustment of the recording electrode on only
1.6+0.4 occasions per subject (including CPAP recordings). This stabil￾1898 V. K. Somers, M. E. Dyken, M. P. Clary, and F. M. Abboud

ity was achieved by careful stabilization of the leg from which re￾cordings were obtained, based on our experience in earlier studies ( 16).
In addition, because many patients were obese, a specially designed
elongated (50 mm) electrode was used. This was inserted into the nerve
at an acute angle to the skin, thus enabling most of the electrode to be
embedded in subcutaneous tissue, providing very stable recordings de￾spite frequent arousals. Studies were discontinued in patients in whom
nerve site recordings were unstable during wakefulness or early stages
of sleep.
We noted high levels of sympathetic burst frequency in patients
with sleep apnea. We therefore further examined whether obesity could
be the explanation for this. We obtained measurements of sympathetic
nerve activity in five obese subjects, four males and one female, 31±7
yr old, with body mass index of 40.3±3.2 kg/m2, similar to the body
mass index of the patients with sleep apnea (41.6±2.3 kg/M2). All
obese subjects denied a history suggestive of obstructive sleep apnea
and were on no medications. One obese subject had mild hypertension.
Statistical analysis was conducted using a two-way ANOVA. The
two factors in the analysis were subject and sleep stage with more than
one observation per stage per subject. Comparisons of interest were
tested by defining mean contrasts. These were then tested using the t
test statistic with standard errors for the test computed from variance
estimates derived from the ANOVA (33). Comparison of wakefulness
measurements between sleep apneic and normal control subjects and
between sleep apneic and obese control subjects was conducted using
an unpaired t test. The P values reported were based on a two-tailed
test. Significance was assumed at the 5% level. Results are expressed
as mean±standard error.
Results
Sympathetic burst frequency when awake was higher in patients
with obstructive sleep apnea (59±14 bursts/min or 76±5
bursts/ 100 heart beats) than in normal controls (34±3 bursts/
min or 50±4 bursts/100 heart beats; P < 0.001) (Fig. 1).
Sympathetic burst frequency during wakefulness was also
higher in patients with obstructive sleep apnea than in obese
controls, in whom burst frequency was 24+5 bursts/min or
34±8 bursts/ 100 heart beats (both P < 0.001) . Repetitive epi￾sodes of apnea occurred continuously throughout all of sleep
in most patients with obstructive sleep apnea, resulting in large
oscillations in blood pressure and sympathetic activity synchro￾nous with the apneas (Figs. 2 and 3). As apnea progressed,
blood pressure rose gradually, in association with increasing
sympathetic activity. On termination of apnea, sympathetic ac￾tivity ceased abruptly, and blood pressure increased, reaching
levels as high as 240/130 mmHg in some subjects. Termination
of apnea was also accompanied by transient increases in muscle
tone and evidence of brief arousal on the electroencephalogram
(Fig. 3). Only one patient had no apneas for substantial periods
of sleep (during stage IV). These oscillations and arousals were
absent during this time.
Because of the blood pressure oscillations, we measured
average blood pressure during sleep as well as peak (highest
blood pressure) for each minute analyzed. Because of continu￾ous occurrence of apneas throughout sleep, almost all nerve
activity occurred during the periods of apnea with suppression
of sympathetic activity on release of apnea, when blood pressure
reached peak levels. Despite periods of sympathetic activity
suppression and despite the already high levels of sympathetic
activity during wakefulness, sympathetic activity measured for
all of sleep increased to 125±+9% of levels measured during
wakefulness (P = 0.01).
Analysis of individual sleep stages showed that the sympa￾thetic activity increases occurred mainly during stage II
(133+9%; P = 0.006) and REM sleep (141+13%; P = 0.007),
when apnea severity and oxygen desaturation were greatest
(Fig. 4). Oxygen saturation was 96±3% when awake and fell
significantly during all sleep stages. Peak sympathetic activity,
at the end of each apneic event, reached 198±55% during stage
I, 299±96% in stage II, 212±24% in stage IV, and 246±36%
in REM (all P < 0.002) (Fig. 4). It is unlikely that changes
in recording electrode position contributed to our findings since
electrode repositioning was required on less than two occasions
per subject, and burst frequency (adjusted for heart rate ] 18 [)
remained stable from wakefulness through the different sleep
stages. Burst frequency was 59±3 bursts/min when awake and
53±3, 52±3, 52±4, and 55±4 bursts/min during stages I, II,
IV, and REM, respectively (all not significant except for stage
II where P = 0.04). Heart rate fell from 77±2.4 beats/min
when awake to 73+2.4, 72±2.4, 71±2.8, and 72±2.7 beats/
min during stages I, II, IV, and REM, respectively (all P
< 0.04). Burst frequency per 100 heart beats was 76±3.4 when
awake and 72+3.5, 73±3.4, 73±4.7, and 76±4.3 during stages
I, II, IV, and REM, respectively (all not significant).
The peak levels of sympathetic activity occurred toward the
end of apnea and immediately before surges in blood pressure.
Blood pressure did not fall during sleep. Mean blood pressure
averaged 92±4.5 during wakefulness, 95±4.5 in stage I, 96±4.5
in stage II, and 89±5.2 in stage IV (Fig. 4). Stage IV data
include measurements from the one patient relatively free of
apneas during stage IV sleep, in whom blood pressure during
stage IV sleep was 14 mmHg lower than when awake. Mean
blood pressure during REM sleep increased to 104±5 mmHg
(P = 0.003) (Fig. 4). Peak mean blood pressure was higher
than wakefulness for all sleep stages, reaching levels of 116±5
mmHg during stage H and 127±7 mmHg during REM (both
P < 0.0001).

Blood pressure, heart rate, and sympathetic activity were
also recorded during sleep in three of the normal control sub￾jects. Changes in these variables during sleep were qualitatively
consistent with changes reported in earlier studies (14-16).
Compared with wakefulness, during non-REM slow-wave
sleep, mean blood pressure fell from 90±6 to 83±7 mmHg,
heart rate fell from 62±4 to 59±2 beats/min, sympathetic burst
frequency fell from 32±2 to 20±7 bursts/min, and sympathetic
burst amplitude decreased to 52±20% of values recorded during
wakefulness.
In four patients with moderate to severe sleep apnea, sub￾jects were awakened after several hours of sleep and treatment
with CPAP was instituted the same night. Airway pressure lev￾els were gradually increased during sleep to minimize episodes
of obstructive apnea. Oxygen saturation during sleep (with cor￾rection for sleep stage) was 20±5.5% higher with CPAP (P
= 0.04) and remained above 90% for all sleep stages. In these

peak blood pressure increased by 36±4 mmHg (P < 0.001).
Average and peak sympathetic activity during sleep were
120±11 and 190±15% of wakefulness values, respectively.
Blood pressure and sympathetic activity measured at the start
of the study, before sleep, did not differ significantly from mea￾surements when awake before starting CPAP. After treatment
with CPAP, average blood pressure increased during sleep by
only 4±3 mmHg and peak blood pressure increased by only
10±4 mmHg (both not significantly different from wake￾fulness). Average and peak sympathetic activities decreased
during sleep and were 30+10 (P = 0.02) and 4±14% less than
wakefulness values, respectively (Figs. 5-7).
Discussion
These studies indicate that sympathetic nerve discharge is very
high in sleep apneic patients even when awake. The sympathetic
nerve and blood pressure profile during sleep is dominated by
responses to episodes of obstructive sleep apnea that occur con￾tinuously throughout sleep. The organized pattern of sleep
stage-related changes in blood pressure and sympathetic activ￾ity evident during sleep in normal humans ( 14-16) is disrupted.
Despite sleep stage and the higher blood pressure during sleep,
there is an increase in sympathetic activity during sleep in pa￾tients with sleep apnea, even though these patients already have
very high levels of nerve activity when awake. Apneic episodes
result in progressive increases in sympathetic nerve activity,
these increases being most marked toward the end of the apnea.
With cessation of apnea and resumption of breathing, there is
an abrupt termination of sympathetic activity and increases in
blood pressure. In contrast to sleep in normal humans, when
blood pressure and sympathetic nerve activity decline signifi￾cantly during non-REM sleep (14-16, 34), both sympathetic
activity and blood pressure reach very high levels during sleep
in patients with sleep apnea. Attenuation of obstructive apneas
by treatment with positive airway pressure limits oxygen desatu-

ration and attenuates both sympathetic activity and blood pres￾sure increases during sleep.
Several reports have described transient increases in blood
pressure during sleep apneic episodes (35, 36). There are few
studies of neural mechanisms in sleep apnea. In a qualitative
report on daytime studies in sleep apneic patients, Hedner et al.
(17) reported high and fluctuating levels of sympathetic activ￾ity, associated with blood pressure oscillations. Sympathetic
activity during wakefulness was higher than that in age-matched
controls. Sleep stages were not reported.
Potential limitations of our study include, first, drug therapy
in some of our subjects. However, high levels of activity during
wakefulness and sleep were also evident in the seven patients
who were not on vasoactive medications. Furthermore, chronic
antihypertensive treatment with beta blockade does not increase
nerve activity (37). The effect of chronic antihypertensive med￾ication on blood pressure responses to apnea is not known.
Second, although microneurographic recordings of sympa￾thetic nerve activity were obtained from a single limb, there is
a remarkable and pronounced synchrony in simultaneous mea￾sures of nerve activity from different sympathetic fascicles re￾gardless of which limb or muscle bed the fascicles innervate
(20). This is true at rest and during apnea (20, 21). Thus
microneurographic measurements reliably indicate the central
drive to post-ganglionic sympathetic neurons to the vascular
bed of skeletal muscle, which constitutes 45% of body mass
and thus plays a key role in regulating arterial pressure (38).
Microneurographic measurements of burst frequency correlate
with plasma norepinephrine levels between individuals (39) and
have the crucial advantage of providing continuous moment-by￾moment measures of sympathetic activity.
The reason for the very high levels of sympathetic discharge,
even in the awake state, in sleep apneic patients is not clear.
Factors such as age, obesity, mild oxygen desaturation, carbon
dioxide retention, and hypertension may be implicated. Age and
hypertension alone may not fully explain the high levels of
activity (17). In a study investigating age-related changes in

sympathetic activity in patients with sleep apnea. However,
body mass index has been shown to correlate inversely with
plasma norepinephrine levels in humans and animals (40). In
obese subjects without a history of sleep apnea, sympathetic
burst frequency when awake is significantly lower than levels
seen in patients with sleep apnea. Thus, obesity alone is unlikely
to explain the increased sympathetic activity noted in patients
with sleep apnea. Even if obesity does contribute significantly
to high levels of sympathetic activity when awake, obstructive
sleep apnea results in even higher levels of sympathetic activity
(and blood pressure) during sleep. These increases are partially
corrected by CPAP therapy, indicating that it is obstructive
sleep apnea, rather than obesity per se, that induces sympathetic
activation and blood pressure increases during sleep. Carbon
dioxide tension was measured in six of our sleep apneic subjects
(by blood gas or end tidal methods) and ranged between 39 and
44 mmHg. Oxygen saturation in our subjects averaged 96+3%.
Oxygen desaturation to levels of 91% do not elicit increases in
sympathetic activity in humans (10). We have shown pre￾viously that hypoventilation-induced hypercapnia (increases of
8 mmHg in pCO2) and accompanying oxygen desaturation to
97% have little effect on sympathetic nerve activity (41). Thus,
hypoxia and hypercapnia are not likely explanations for high
levels of sympathetic activity during wakefulness in our sub￾jects.
The oscillations in sympathetic discharge and blood pressure
during sleep are explained by chemoreflex mechanisms and
their interactions with baroreflexes and the pulmonary afferents
( 10, 11, 42). Oxygen desaturation and carbon dioxide retention
during sleep apnea both act to increase sympathetic discharge
by stimulation of the peripheral and central chemoreflexes ( 11).
With progression of apnea, both of these stimuli increase in
intensity, resulting in increased sympathetic discharge to muscle
(and probably splanchnic and renal) vascular beds. This vaso￾constriction also helps to maintain blood pressure during the
apneic episode when cardiac output is decreased because of
decreased venous return due to cessation of breathing and the
Mueller maneuver (43, 44). With termination of apnea and
resumption of breathing, there is a tachycardia and an increase
in venous return to the heart and, thus, increased cardiac output
(43). This increased cardiac output is superimposed upon pe￾ripheral vasoconstriction resulting in surges in blood pressure
to levels of 240/130 mmHg in some subjects. The abrupt termi￾nation of sympathetic activity during resumption of breathing

is probably due to a combination of factors. First, breathing and
stimulation of the pulmonary afferents inhibit sympathetic nerve
activity (10-12). Second, the blood pressure increase acting
via the baroreflexes further suppresses sympathetic discharge
(42). Third, resumption of breathing diminishes hypoxic and
hypercapnic chemoreflex stimulation. Fourth, we have shown
previously that during REM sleep in normal humans brief in￾creases in muscle tone are associated with abrupt sympathetic
inhibition (16). Similar, but more marked increases in muscle
tone at the end of apneic events may, at least during REM,
contribute to sympathetic inhibition in patients with sleep apnea
(Fig. 3). Thus, reflex and hemodynamic interactions involving
the chemoreflexes, the pulmonary afferents, the Mueller maneu￾ver (45), venous return, cardiac output, muscle tone, and the
baroreflexes all interact to result in repetitive and potentially
harmful fluctuations in blood pressure and sympathetic dis￾charge. Arousal from sleep for a brief period at the end of apnea
may also be implicated in the responses we describe (46).
The increased sympathetic nerve activity during sleep oc￾curs mainly during apnea episodes and is most intense toward
the end of the apnea when hypoxia, hypercapnia, and respiratory
acidosis are most profound and immediately before rapid
changes in cardiac afterload. These findings suggest an explana￾tion for recurrent episodes of pulmonary edema in patients with
obstructive sleep apnea (47). Chronic exposure to these neuro￾humoral stresses, occurring repetitively each night, may result
in adverse cardiac and vascular alterations over many years.
Treatment of obstructive apnea by CPAP attenuates blood
pressure and sympathetic increases during sleep. Although
CPAP blunts the blood pressure increase during sleep, blood
pressure does not fall to below wakefulness levels, as is seen
in sleep in normal subjects (14-16). This may be due to CPAP
attenuating, but not eliminating, the obstructive apneas. Never￾theless, the lower blood pressure and sympathetic activity and
higher oxygen saturation after CPAP indicate a likely mecha￾nism to explain the beneficial effects of CPAP in preventing
electrocardiogram changes suggestive of ischemia in patients
with sleep apnea (8) and improving cardiac function in heart
failure patients with obstructive sleep apnea (48).
