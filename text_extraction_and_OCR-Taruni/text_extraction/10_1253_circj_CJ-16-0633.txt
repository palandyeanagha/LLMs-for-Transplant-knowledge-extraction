Several reports on clinical outcomes after pericardiec￾tomy have been published, mainly from Europe and the 
USA.4–6,11 With respect to Japanese populations, Tokuda 
et al have reported on the short-term surgical outcome of 
pericardiectomy,12 but there are few reports about long￾term clinical outcomes after pericardiectomy.
The purpose of the present study was to clarify the long￾term clinical outcomes and prognostic factors after peri￾cardiectomy for CP among a Japanese population.
Methods
Study Population
We retrospectively investigated 48 consecutive patients 
who underwent pericardiectomy for CP between 1985 and 
2014 at Tenri Hospital.
Among these 48 patients, 3 who had significant valvular 
Constrictive pericarditis (CP) is characterized by 
impaired diastolic filling of the ventricles as a result 
of scarring and consequent loss of the normal elas￾ticity of the pericardial sac, which leads to heart failure.1,2
Pericardiectomy is considered to be the mainstay of CP 
treatment. However, medical therapy may be used to opti￾mize hemodynamics preoperatively and for palliative con￾trol of symptoms in patients who are not candidates for 
surgery.3
Long-term clinical outcomes after pericardiectomy for 
CP vary according to the etiology.4–7 In “developed” coun￾tries, the most common causes of CP are idiopathic, post￾cardiac surgery (CS), and post-radiation. Tuberculosis (TB) 
is a rare cause of CP in developed countries, whereas it is a 
major cause of CP in “developing” countries.8,9 Therefore, 
there may be ethnic differences in the etiology and progno￾sis of CP.10

Background: Constrictive pericarditis (CP) is characterized by impaired diastolic cardiac function leading to heart failure. 
Pericardiectomy is considered effective treatment for CP, but data on long-term clinical outcomes after pericardiectomy are limited.
Methods and Results: We retrospectively investigated 45 consecutive patients (mean age, 59±14 years) who underwent pericar￾diectomy for CP. Preoperative clinical factors, parameters of cardiac catheterization, and cardiac events were examined. Cardiac 
events were defined as hospitalization owing to heart failure or cardiac death. Median follow-up was 5.7 years. CP etiology was 
idiopathic in 16 patients, post-cardiac surgery (CS) in 21, tuberculosis-related in 4, non-tuberculosis infection-related in 2, infarction￾related in 1, and post-radiation in 1. The 5-year event-free survival was 65%. Patients with idiopathic CP and tuberculosis-related 
CP had favorable outcomes compared with post-CS CP (5-year event-free survival: idiopathic, 80%; tuberculosis, 100%; post-CS, 
52%). Higher age (hazard ratio: 2.51), preoperative atrial fibrillation (3.25), advanced New York Heart Association class (3.92), and 
increased pulmonary artery pressure (1.06) were predictors of cardiac events. Patients with postoperative right-atrial pressure 
≥9mmHg had lower event-free survival than those with right-atrial pressure <9 mmHg (39% vs. 75% at 5 years, P=0.013).
Conclusions: Long-term clinical outcomes after pericardiectomy among a Japanese population were related to the underlying etiology 
and the patient’s preoperative clinical condition. Postoperative cardiac catheterization may be helpful in the prediction of prognosis 
after pericardiectomy.

Long-Term Prognosis After Pericardiectomy 207
ation with CABG. “Constriction with a previous history of 
chest radiation” was defined as post-radiation CP. Additional 
possible etiologies of CP were infectious (bacterial and 
fungal) or infarction-related CP. Furthermore, infectious 
CP was divided into TB-related CP or non-TB-related CP. 
“Idiopathic CP” was defined as constriction after previous 
viral infection. Patients who could not be classified into 
any of the groups described were also considered to have 
idiopathic CP.
“Total pericardiectomy” was defined as resection of the 
anterior pericardium between the 2 phrenic nerves, the 
basal aspect of the pericardium over the diaphragm, the 
posterior part of the pericardium over the diaphragm lying 
on the left and right ventricles, and the pericardium over 
the great arteries and both atria. “Partial pericardiectomy” 
was defined as any pericardial excision that did not meet 
the criteria for total pericardiectomy.
disease (2 with mitral regurgitation; 1 with mitral stenosis) 
and underwent concomitant replacement of the mitral 
valve at pericardiectomy were excluded. Hence, 45 patients 
were enrolled.
The diagnosis of CP was based on clinical features, char￾acteristics of transthoracic echocardiography, parameters 
of right-heart catheterization, and other imaging modali￾ties (chest radiography, computed tomography, magnetic 
resonance imaging). Clinical outcomes and their predictors 
were evaluated. The study protocol was approved by the 
Institutional Ethics Committee at Tenri Hospital (Nara, 
Japan).
Etiologies of CP and Pericardiectomy
In accordance with previous reports, the etiology of CP 
was determined from the medical history of the patient.5,6
“Postoperative constriction” was defined as post-CS CP, 
and prior CS was classified as follows: coronary artery 
bypass grafting (CABG); valve operation; and valve oper￾Table 1. Baseline Characteristics of the CP Patients at Pericardiectomy

Cardiac Events
The median follow-up period was 5.7 (range, 0.8–10.3) 
years. Overall cardiac event-free curves and survival curves 
from cardiac death are shown in Figure 1A and 1B, respec￾tively. Perioperative mortality rate was 6.7%, and the cause 
of perioperative death was progressive heart failure in all 
patients. Respective cardiac event-free survival and sur￾vival from cardiac death were 65% and 84% at 5 years, and 
55% and 80% at 7 years.
Figure 1C and 1D show the cardiac event-free survival 
and survival from cardiac death based on the underlying 
etiology, respectively. Idiopathic CP and TB-related CP 
showed favorable outcomes compared with post-CS CP 
(5-year cardiac event-free survival: idiopathic, 80%; TB￾related, 100%; post-CS, 52%). The number of patients with 
non-TB-related and infarction-related CP was very small, 
but none experienced a cardiac event, whereas 1 patient 
with post-radiation CP died from congestive heart failure 
<1 year after pericardiectomy. Survival from cardiac death 
elicited similar results (5-year survival: idiopathic, 92%; 
TB-related, 100%; non-TB-related, 100%; infarction-related, 
100%; post-CS, 73%; post-radiation, 0%).
Predictors of Cardiac Events
Table 2 details the results of the univariate analysis to 
identify predictors of cardiac events. Univariate analysis 
showed higher age (≥65 years, P=0.033), preoperative AF 
(P=0.006), preoperative advanced NYHA class (P=0.013), 
and increased systolic pulmonary artery pressure (P=0.047) 
to be significant predictors of cardiac events.
Freedom from cardiac events was lower in patients with 
preoperative AF (n=19) than in those without AF (n=26) 
(41% vs. 86% at 5 years; P=0.005) (Figure 2A). Freedom 
from cardiac events was also lower in patients with preop￾erative advanced NYHA class (III–IV) (n=32) than in 
those with NYHA class I–II (n=13) (58% vs. 88% at 5 
years; P=0.021) (Figure 2B).
Postoperative Changes in Clinical Status and 
Hemodynamics
Preoperative and postoperative NHYA classes are shown 
in Figure 3. A total of 32 patients (71%) were in NYHA 
class III–IV preoperatively, which improved to NYHA class 
I–II (n=38, 84%) after pericardiectomy. However, 16% 
remained in NYHA class III even after pericardiectomy.
For 26 patients who underwent postoperative cardiac 
catheterization, we compared preoperative and postopera￾tive RAP and CI. Postoperative RAP decreased signifi￾cantly (P<0.01). CI also increased postoperatively, but the 
change was not significant (P=0.12) (Figure 3). Cardiac 
event-free survival was significantly lower in patients with 
postoperative RAP ≥9mmHg (n=13) than in those with 
RAP <9mmHg (n=13) (39% vs. 75% at 5 years; P=0.013) 
(Figure 4A). A subgroup of patients with postoperative CI 
<2.2L/min/m2 (n=9) also had lower cardiac event-free sur￾vival compared with those with CI ≥2.2L/min/m2 (n=17), 
but the difference was not significant (56% vs. 59% at 5 
years; P=0.051) (Figure 4B). Furthermore, there was no 
significant difference in surgical strategy (partial or total 
pericardiectomy) among these subgroups. Surgical strategy 
was not directly related to improvement in hemodynamics, 
such as postoperative RAP and CI. These cutoff values 
were determined by median values or clinically meaningful 
reference values, as described in the Methods.
Cardiac Events After Pericardiectomy and Predictors
“Cardiac events” were defined as either hospitalization 
owing to heart failure or cardiac death. “Cardiac death” 
was defined as sudden death or death from congestive 
heart failure. “Perioperative mortality” was defined as 
death during hospitalization for pericardiectomy.
To analyze the predictors of cardiac events, we examined 
the clinical factors, preoperative clinical condition, and 
preoperative parameters of cardiac catheterization. Clinical 
factors were age, sex, and underlying disease. Underlying 
disease included hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipid￾emia, coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation (AF). 
Hypertension was defined by a systolic blood pressure (BP) 
≥140mmHg and/or a diastolic BP ≥90mmHg, or use of 
antihypertensive medications. Dyslipidemia was defined as 
a serum cholesterol level ≥220mg/dL or use of cholesterol￾lowering medications. Diabetes mellitus was defined as 
hyperglycemia that necessitated use of medications. 
Coronary artery disease was defined by previous history of 
angina, myocardial infarction, or percutaneous coronary 
intervention, or a significant stenosis in a coronary artery 
revealed by coronary angiography. Preoperative clinical 
condition was evaluated by New York Heart Association 
(NYHA) class based on reporting of symptoms by the 
patients. Data on cardiac catheterization included systolic 
BP, systolic pulmonary artery pressure, mean right-atrial 
pressure (RAP), mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, 
cardiac output, and the cardiac index (CI).
Effectiveness of Pericardiectomy
To evaluate the effectiveness of pericardiectomy, we also 
analyzed preoperative and postoperative changes in clini￾cal status (NYHA class) and hemodynamics (RAP and CI). 
Postoperative cardiac catheterization was undertaken 
before hospital discharge.
Furthermore, we divided the patients into 2 groups based 
on their postoperative RAP or CI and compared cardiac 
event-free survival. The cutoff value of postoperative 
RAP was determined by the median value. Postoperative 
CI was dichotomized using a clinically meaningful refer￾ence value.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were carried out using JMP v8 (SAS 
Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Continuous variables are 
presented as the mean±SD or median and interquartile 
range. Event-free survival is shown by Kaplan-Meier curves, 
and comparisons between several groups were done using 
a log-rank test. Relative risk and 95% confidence intervals 
were calculated using Cox proportional hazard analysis. 
P<0.05 was considered significant.
Results
Baseline Characteristics of Patients (Table 1)
The study population comprised 34 men and 11 women 
with a mean age of 59±14 years at the time of pericardiec￾tomy. Etiology of CP was idiopathic in 16 patients (36%), 
post-CS in 21 patients (47%), TB-related in 4 patients (9%), 
non-TB-related in 2 patients (4%), infarction-related in 1 
patient (2%), and post-radiation in 1 patient (2%). Among 
the 21 patients with post-CS CP, prior CS was CABG in 
11 patients, valve operation in 9 patients (mitral valve, 4; 
aortic valve, 2; mitral and aortic valves, 3), and valve 
operation with CABG in 1 patient.

are related to the underlying etiology.4–7,16 Bertog et al5
reported that survival at a median follow-up of 6.9 years 
was 63% among 163 patients undergoing pericardiectomy. 
Idiopathic CP was related to the best survival (88%), fol￾lowed by post-CS CP (66%) and post-radiation CP (27%). 
Szabó et al found that idiopathic CP and TB-related CP 
had a good prognosis (81% and 80%, respectively) followed 
by post-CS (50%), and post-radiation (0%), at 5 years after 
pericardiectomy.6 In the present study, overall event-free 
survival and survival from cardiac death at a median 
follow-up of 5.7 years were 62% and 84%, respectively. 
Post-CS CP showed a poor prognosis compared with 
idiopathic CP and TB-related CP. Our study population 
included only 1 patient with post-radiation CP, but this 
patient died <1 year after pericardiectomy, our result was 
substantially similar to the reports mentioned above.
Preoperative clinical status, not only the etiology of CP, 
might affect the prognosis after pericardiectomy. Studies 
have reported higher age and pulmonary hypertension to 
be related to poor clinical outcomes,4,5 which is consistent 
with our study. Pulmonary hypertension is considered to 
reflect the severity of constriction and concomitant myo￾cardial dysfunction.5
Discussion
In the present study, we examined the etiology of CP, long￾term clinical outcomes, and prognostic factors after peri￾cardiectomy among a Japanese population. Long-term 
clinical outcomes were affected by etiology, and post-CS 
CP had a higher event rate than idiopathic CP or TB-related 
CP. Higher age, preoperative AF, advanced NYHA class, 
and pulmonary hypertension were related to poor clinical 
outcomes.
Surgical Mortality
Surgical removal of the pericardium is associated with a 
considerable (6–12%) mortality rate.13–15 In our study, the 
perioperative mortality rate was 6.7%, which was in accor￾dance with previous studies. The most common cause of 
operative death is low-output heart failure.5,10 In agree￾ment with previous studies, the cause of death was progres￾sive heart failure in all 3 patients who died perioperatively 
in the present study.

cells may develop during long-term compression by the 
pericardium. NYHA class is thought to reflect the clinical 
condition. Therefore, pericardiectomy should be under￾taken as early as possible after the diagnosis of CP is made 
before multi-organ dysfunction and/or myocardial atrophy 
A correlation between preoperative NYHA class and the 
prognosis after pericardiectomy is well known, as shown in 
the present study.4,6 Multi-organ dysfunction may progress, 
alongside a longer period of time with pericardial constric￾tion and low output. Furthermore, atrophy of myocardial

diastolic mitral inflow velocity and postoperative persistent 
abnormal diastolic filling pattern on Doppler echocardiog￾raphy are related to poor prognosis.18,19 However, our 
study included old data and several CP patients after 
mitral valve replacement, so the E velocity and diastolic 
filling pattern could not be assessed. Furthermore, because 
of the study’s retrospective nature, serial transthoracic 
echocardiography had not been performed in all the 
patients. Therefore, the chronological change in the dia￾stolic filling pattern also could not be evaluated.
Effectiveness of Pericardiectomy
It has been reported that pericardiectomy can provide 
symptom relief and hemodynamic improvement in most 
patients, but a certain proportion of patients do not show 
any postoperative improvement.6
In our study, the number of patients in NYHA class 
occurs beyond the point of reversibility.
Furthermore, preoperative AF was related to a high 
prevalence of cardiac events. The present study is the first 
to demonstrate the relationship between AF and the prog￾nosis of CP. In early diastole, blood stored in the left 
atrium is driven into the left ventricle by the high early 
diastolic atrial-ventricular pressure gradient. At end-diastole, 
atrial contraction occurs, forcing blood to fill the left ven￾tricle.17 The left atrium contributes considerably to cardiac 
function. Among CP patients with AF, the loss of atrial 
contraction at end-diastole, in addition to the impaired 
diastolic filling of the left ventricle caused by a constricted 
pericardial sac, might have a further influence on cardiac 
filling and output, which may be related to poor clinical 
outcomes.
Regarding the transthoracic echocardiographic charac￾teristics, previous studies report preoperative high early (E)

III–IV decreased from 32 (71%) to 7 (16%) postopera￾tively, and RAP and CI also improved. However, 16% of 
the study patients remained in NYHA class III even after 
pericardiectomy. This finding may be related to incomplete 
removal of the pericardial sac, involvement of visceral 
epicardium, or myocardial atrophy.4
As for surgical strategy (partial or total pericardiec￾tomy), its effect on long-term outcomes remains controver￾sial.12,14,16,20 In the present study, Cox proportional hazard 
analysis did not identify surgical strategy as a predictor of 
cardiac events. However, the patients with post-CS CP 
showed poorer prognosis and higher rate of partial peri￾cardiectomy than the other groups of CP patients. There￾fore, it is possible that partial pericardiectomy is related to 
the poor prognosis of post-CS CP.
Clinical Implications of Postoperative Cardiac 
Catheterization
In the present study, the subgroup of patients with post￾operative RAP ≥9mmHg had low cardiac event-free sur￾vival in comparison with those with RAP <9mmHg. The 
subgroup of patients with CI ≥2.2L/min/m2 also had low 
cardiac event-free survival compared with those with CI 
<2.2L/min/m2. Our study suggests that patients who achieve 
release of constriction by pericardiectomy and experience 
marked improvement in hemodynamics have a good prog￾nosis, whereas those who do not have a release of con￾striction have a poor prognosis. Therefore, postoperative 
cardiac catheterization may be helpful in the prediction of 
long-term clinical outcome after pericardiectomy.
Study Limitations
This is the first study to summarize the long-term clinical 
outcomes after pericardiectomy for CP among a Japanese 
population. However, the present study has 3 main limita￾tions.
First, the prevalence of CP was low, therefore, the total 
number of patients was relatively small. Second, our study 
population consisted mainly of those with idiopathic CP or 
post-CS CP, and the number of patient with post-radiation 
or TB-related CP was limited. This was a single-center 
retrospective cohort study, and this deviation in etiology 
was inevitable, and might have affected our results. Third, 
there was a limited number of patients, so we could not 
undertake a multivariate analysis to identify prognostic 
factors after pericardiectomy.
Conclusions
Long-term clinical outcomes after pericardiectomy for CP 
among a Japanese population were related to the underly￾ing etiology and preoperative clinical condition. Postop￾erative cardiac catheterization may be helpful in predicting 
prognosis after pericardiectomy.
