Abstract
Background: To report our experience with SBRT in primary and secondary liver tumors.
Methods: We retrospectively analysed 55 patients (70 lesions) with a median follow-up of 10 months (range 1–57)
treated from 2011 to 2016. All patients had not been eligible for other local treatment options. Median age was
64 years and 64% were male. 27 patients (36 lesions) suffered from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC, Child A:78%,
Child B:18%, Child C:4%), 28 patients (34 lesions) had oligometastatic liver disease (MD). Treatment planning was
based on 4D-CT usually after placement of fiducials. Dose and fractionation varied depending on localization and
size, most commonly 3 × 12.5 Gy (prescribed to the surrounding 65%-isodose) in 56% and 5x8Gy (80% isodose) in
20% of the treated lesions.
Results: Local recurrence was observed in 7 patients (13%) and 8 lesions (11%), resulting in estimated 1- and 2-year local
control rates (LC) of 91 and 74%. Estimated 1- and 2-year rates of Freedom from hepatic failure (FFHF) were 42 and 28%.
Number of lesions was predictive for LC and FFHF in the entire cohort. Estimated 1- and 2-year overall survival (OS) was
76 and 57%. OS was significantly affected by number of treated lesions and performance status. In the HCC subgroup,
pretreatment liver function and gender were also predictive for OS. Maximum acute non-hepatic toxicity was grade 1
in 16% and grade 2 in 10% of the patients. Three HCC patients (11%) developed marked deterioration of liver function
(grade 3/4).
Conclusions: SBRT resulted in high local control and acceptable survival rates in patients with HCC or MD not
amendable to other locally-ablative treatment options with limited toxicity. Care should be taken in HCC patients
with Child B cirrhosis.

Background
Primary and metastatic liver tumors are among the most
common malignancies and tumour-related causes of death
worldwide [1, 2]. Treatment paradigms have changed dra￾matically in the last decades in favor of local treatments in
primary liver cancers and oligometastatic (especially
liver-confined) disease because of the evolving evidence for
possible cure or at least long-term survival [3, 4].
Treatment options range from liver transplantation (for
HCC) or extended surgical resections (for MD) to less inva￾sive techniques like radiofrequency ablation (RFA), transar￾terial chemoembolization (TACE) or selective internal
radiotherapy (SIRT). However, the potential benefit of such
treatment options needs to be weighed against the possibil￾ity that local treatment results in impairment of liver func￾tion or liver failure, especially in the presence of an
underlying liver disease, which is the background upon
most primary malignancies arise [4]. Moreover, any of the
mentioned treatments has its limitations. For example sur￾gery is often limited by comorbidities or poor liver function
[4] while lesions directly adjacent to major vessels or bile

ducts are not well suited for RFA [5] and patients with por￾tal vein thrombosis are not eligible for TACE [6].
Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is a highly
conformal technique of percutaneous radiation therapy
delivered in a small number of large fractions [7]. It suf￾ficiently spares dose to adjacent organs at risk due to its
sharp dose fall-off outside the target, while adequate
tumor control is maintained due to the enhanced bio￾logical effectivity of the large single doses. Stereotactic
radiation approaches have been already successfully in￾troduced into the treatment of primary and secondary
brain and lung tumors and have shown to result in low
toxicity and at least comparable outcome with regard to
surgery [7–10]. Several groups have shown that SBRT
can also be effectively employed with acceptable toxicity
for the treatment of liver malignancies [11]. However, no
randomized trials comparing SBRT to other local treat￾ment options have been conducted so far, and only
scarce prospective data on the employment of SBRT in
the treatment of liver lesions are available. Moreover, no
generally accepted criteria for patient selection or a gen￾erally accepted dose and fractionation concept exists.
Therefore we report our experience with SBRT for pri￾mary and secondary liver tumors.
Methods
In our institution, SBRT has been used for the treatment
of malignant liver lesions for the first time in 2011. Since
then, an increasing number of patients have been treated
each year (fig. 1). For the current analysis, we retrospect￾ively selected and analyzed all patients affected by HCC
or MD who underwent SBRT to 1–3 liver lesions. Indi￾cation for SBRT was seen in patients not eligible for
other local treatment options according to multidiscip￾linary evaluation. Pretreatment investigations included
MRI and/or contrast-enhanced biphasic liver CT, liver
function tests for HCC patients and additional CT/
PET-CT staging for MD patients.
Patient characteristics
The entire cohort consisted of 55 patients with 70
treated lesions. Median age was 64 years (31–83), 64%
were male and the median Karnofsky performance score
(KPS) was 90% (60–100%). 28 patients showed MD in
whom 34 lesions were treated. Most of them suffered
from colorectal cancer (32%) followed by NSCLC (14%)
and soft-tissue sarcomas (14%). 27 patients showed HCC
in whom 36 lesions were treated. Underlying liver cir￾rhosis was present in all HCC patients, caused by viral
hepatitis (B and C) in 10 patients (37%), alcohol con￾sumption in 5 (19%), autoimmune hepatitis in 1 (4%)
and by unknown reason in 11 patients (41%). Liver func￾tion was moderately restricted in the majority of them
(Child A: 21[78%], Child B: 5[18%], Child C: 1[4%]),

with good performance score and was listed for liver

transplantation, therefore our interdisciplinary tumor￾board opted for SBRT as bridging.
Treatment characteristics
Treatment in HCC patients consisted of SBRT alone in
12 patients while 15 patients received selective TACE to
the same lesions upfront to SBRT (within 6 weeks). Five
patients received additional RFA treatments to different
lesions prior to SBRT (within 6 weeks). 23/27 patients
had a median of 2 (range 1–8) previous local treatments
(surgery, RFA, TACE or SIRT). Treatment of metastatic
patients consisted of SBRT alone in 25 patients or SBRT
combined with surgery or RFA to different lesions
(within 6 weeks) in 3 patients. Primary tumor was con￾trolled in all patients with MD at the time of SBRT.
Additive systemic therapy within three months from
SBRT was given to 1 patient with HCC and 8 patients
with MD.
SBRT
Prior to SBRT, 42 patients received CT-guided implant￾ation of 1–3 fiducials (Visicoil™, IBA dosimetry or
MPB™, MPB Scherer Medizinprodukte) per lesion unless
enhancement of lipiodol in patients with prior TACE
(n = 8) or the presence of surgical clips (n = 5) were
deemed sufficient to guide the procedure. Patients were
immobilized using a vacuum pillow in combination with
an alpha-cradle. Abdominal compression was used since
2014 (n = 26, 47%). Treatment planning was based on
contrast-enhanced 4D-CT. Gross tumor volume (GTV)
was contoured as the visible tumor on the free-breathing
CT and on all respiratory phases of the 4D-CT supple￾mented by information from MRI if available. An in￾ternal target volume (ITV) was constructed and
enlarged by an isotropic margin of 6 mm to obtain the
planning target volume (PTV). Dose was prescribed to
the PTV surrounding isodose in all patients. Prescription
isodose, single dose and number of fractions depended
on size and location of the lesions. Number of lesions
did not influence prescription dose in general. The most
common schemes were 3 × 12.5 Gy (65%-isodose) in
56% and 5x8Gy (80%-isodose) in 20% of the treated le￾sions delivered every other day. Implanted fiducials or
lipiodol enhancement were contoured accordingly to re￾ceive a fiducial or lipiodol ITV, which was used for daily
patient set-up. Treatment was performed using daily
CBCT image-guidance.
Statistical and legal considerations
Regular follow-up examinations (including physical
examination, laboratory tests (liver function and tumor
marker tests), MRI/CT of the liver) took place at our de￾partment or the departments of gastroenterology/oncol￾ogy every three months for one year, every 6 months for
the second and annually thereafter. Toxicity was scored
retrospectively according to CTCAE v4.03. Because of
the retrospective nature not all patients had received
exactly the same laboratory tests. Therefore changes in

hepatic laboratory tests without symptoms were not
counted as toxicity. Marked deterioration of liver func￾tion was defined as change in CHILD-Pugh class from A
to B or B to C in HCC patients or symptomatic changes
in liver function in MD patients. Biological effective dose
(BED) of the maximum PTV dose was calculated ac￾cording to the LQ formalism: BED = n*d*(1 + d/{α/β})
with n being the number of fractions, d the daily single
fraction dose and alpha-beta for tumor tissue of 10 Gy.
Local control (LC) was defined as absence of tumor pro￾gression in the region of the treated lesion. Freedom
from hepatic failure (FFHF) was defined as absence of
tumor progression in the liver. All time-to-event data
was calculated from the first day of SBRT using the
Kaplan-Meier method. All endpoints and subgroup ana￾lyses are reported referring to patients (not lesions) if
not otherwise specified. Differences in subgroups were
assessed by the logrank test for univariate analysis. Due
to the low number of events multivariate analysis was
not performed. The pearsons test was used for evalu￾ation of possible correlations between parameters. A
p-value of < 0.05 was defined as statistically significant.
The analysis was in accordance to the declaration of
Helsinki in its latest version and was approved by our in￾dependent Ethics committee.
Results
Median follow-up in all patients was 10 months (1–57)
and 13 months in survivors. Since implementation of
the technique at our center in 2011 we have seen a con￾tinuous increase in patient numbers per year resulting in
56% of the included patients treated in 2015/16 (fig. 1).
Median GTV (measured on free-breathing CT) per pa￾tient was 14.6 ccm (0.4–204) and 6.6 ccm per lesion
(0.2–204) and median PTV was 75.5 ccm (17.7–511.6)
per patient and 59 ccm (15–512) per lesion.
LC
Local recurrence was observed in 7/55 patients (13%)
translating into estimated 1- and 2-year LC-rates of 91
and 74% (fig. 2). Median time to local failure in these 7
patients was 8 months (2–39). In univariate analysis,
only the number of lesions was predictive for LC
(1-year-LC single 97% vs. multiple 67%,p = 0.011, Fig. 2,
Table 2). In the HCC group we observed estimated 1-
and 2-year LC-rates of 92%. The number of lesions was
the only factor with significant impact on LC (1-year-LC
single 100% vs. multiple 71%,p = 0.024). No significant
difference was observed comparing patients with TACE
+SBRT versus SBRT alone. In the MD group, we ob￾served estimated 1- and 2-year LC-rates of 89 and 64%.
Improved LC was significantly associated with treatment
of a single lesion (1-year-LC 95% vs. 0%,p = 0.027),
BED>150Gy (1-year-LC 100% vs. 82%,p = 0.036) and fe￾male gender (1-year-LC 100% vs. 78%,p = 0.039). We
further analyzed possible associations between the num￾ber of lesions and dose parameters (BED maximum, pre￾scription dose) but did not find any significant
correlations (data not shown).
If LC was analysed per lesion, we observed local fail￾ures in 8/70 lesions (11%), translating into 1- and 2-year
LC-rates of 91 and 74%. No factors with significant im￾pact on LC could be identified for the entire cohort or
the HCC subgroup. However, regarding the MD sub￾group, we observed a significant association of LC with
GTV volume (1-year LC GTV ≤6.25ccm 100% vs. 80%
with GTV > 6.25ccm;p = 0.041).
FFHF
29/55 patients (53%) showed hepatic failure of whom only
1 had an isolated local failure, while 22 showed isolated fail￾ures outside the treated volume and 6 had combined fail￾ures. Estimated 1- and 2-year FFHF-rates were 42 and 28%
(fig. 3). Again, only the number of lesions (1-yr-FFHF single
49% vs. 19% multiple,p = 0.047) was predictive for FFHF

(Fig. 3, Table 2). In the HCC subgroup, we observed esti￾mated 1- and 2-year FFHF-rates of 41%. FFHF was signifi￾cantly affected by the number of lesions (1-year-FFHF
single 53% vs 15% in multiple,p = 0.01). In the MD sub￾group we found estimated 1- and 2-year FFHF-rates of 40
and 25%. FFHF was significantly associated with perform￾ance status (1-year-FFHF KPS ≤ 70 0% vs. 43% with KPS >
70,p = 0.006).
OS
16 patients (29%) have died, translating into estimated
1- and 2-year OS-rates of 76 and 57% (Fig. 4). Prognos￾tic factors regarding OS were number of treated lesions
(1-yr-OS single 88% vs 40% in multiple,p < 0.001, Fig. 4)
and performance status (1-yr-OS KPS > 70 79% vs 50%
KPS ≤ 70,p = 0.028, Fig. 4), see Table 2. A trend was also
observed for gender (1-yr-OS male 83% vs 67% female,
p = 0.055). In the HCC subgroup we observed estimated
1- and 2-year OS-rates of 68 and 57%. OS was signifi￾cantly associated with number of treated lesions
(1-year-OS single 84% vs 39% multiple,p < 0.001), pre￾treatment liver function (1-year-OS Child-Pugh A 76%
vs. Child-Pugh B 28%,p = 0.036) and gender (1-year-OS
male 83% vs. female 43%,p = 0.049). In the MD subgroup
we observed estimated 1- and 2-year OS-rates of 84 and
67%. OS was significantly associated with performance
status (1-year-OS KPS > 70 90% vs. 33% KPS ≤ 70,p <
0.001) and number of treated lesions (1-year-OS single
90% vs. 42% multiple,p = 0.036).
Toxicity
CT-guided fiducial placement was feasible without any
complications. SBRT treatment could be performed as
planned in all except one patient (2%) who prematurely
finished radiation treatment due to humerus fracture.
Maximum acute toxicity was grade 1 in 9 patients (16%),

grade 2 in 6 (10%), grade 3 in 2 (4%) and grade 4 in 1
patient (2%), see Table 3. The most frequent side effects
were fatigue and gastrointestinal symptoms like mild
nausea or diarrhea. Three patients with HCC (11%) de￾veloped marked deterioration of liver function without
disease progression. Two had a decline in Child-Pugh
stage from A to B. One patient with Child-Pugh C cir￾rhosis developed hepatic failure (grade 4) shortly after
SBRT which was successfully treated by liver
transplantation.
Discussion
Outcome with SBRT
Regarding LC, we observed 1- and 2-year-rates of 91
and 74% for the entire cohort. LC seemed slightly im￾proved in the HCC group with 1- and 2-year-rates of
92% compared to the MD group with 1- and
2-year-rates of 89 and 64%, although this difference did
not reach statistical significance. These results are in line
with other series including both primary and secondary
liver tumors treated with similar concepts. For example
Mendez-Romero et al. [12] described their results of a
phase I-II trial including 25 patients with HCC or MD
treated mainly with a 3 × 12.5Gy concept and found 1-
and 2-year LC-rates of 91 and 82%. If HCC and MD are
considered separately, our results are still in the pub￾lished range of 75–100% 1-year-LC in HCC [4] and 71–
94% 1-year-LC in MD patients [13] reported in recent
major series (Table 4).
With regard to OS, we observed 1- and 2-year-rates of
76 and 57% for the entire cohort. OS seemed to be
slightly better in the MD group with 1- and 2-year
OS-rates of 84 and 67% compared to the HCC group
with 1- and 2-year OS-rates of 68 and 57%, although this
difference did not reach statistical significance.
Mendez-Romero et al. [12] described similar outcomes
with 1- and 2-year OS-rates of 82 and 54% for the whole
group, 85 and 62% for patients with MD and 75 and
40% for patients with HCC. Moreover, our results are in
the range of published results focusing on primary or
secondary liver tumors with 1- and 2-year OS-rates of
62–85% and 38–70% in metastatic patients [3] and 55–
100 and 53%–69% in HCC patients [4].
In contrast to the encouraging rates for LC and OS,
we observed rather poor 1- and 2-year FFHF-rates of 42
and 28% for the entire cohort, which were mainly driven
by intrahepatic outfield failures indicating a high risk for
the development of new lesions in these heavily pre￾treated patients. This pattern was seen in patients with
HCC (1- and 2-year FFHF 42%) as well as in patients
with MD (1- and 2-year FFHF 40 and 25%) although
more pronounced in the latter group. Similar results
have been reported by others for both entities. For ex￾ample Yoon et al. [14] found a crude rate of 63% intra￾hepatic outfield failures and 71% hepatic failures in total,
translating into a 1-year hepatic-failure-free-survival-rate
of 52% in their cohort of 92 patients with HCC treated
with SBRT. Chang et al. [15] reported a crude rate of

Prognostic factors
We analyzed our entire cohort and both subgroups
(HCC and MD) with regard to possible prognostic fac￾tors for each endpoint. Regarding LC, lesion size [16–
18] and dose of SBRT [5, 15, 16, 18–20] have been the
most consistently reported prognostic factors for both
groups. Although a variety of definitions and tresholds
have been used and some studies did not found any as￾sociations at all [19–22]. We could not confirm a statis￾tically significant association of GTV volume or BED
with LC regarding the entire cohort and the subgroup of
HCC patients. However, we observed a significantly re￾duced LC-rate with lower BED and larger GTV volume
in the subgroup of patients with MD, thus emphasizing
the findings of others suggesting a relationship between
LC and lesion size and/or dose at least in metastatic pa￾tients. Interestingly, the number of lesions was the main
factor in our study with a significant impact on LC,
however this might be simply due to statistical reasons
as patients with more lesions obviously have a high
probability to fail at least in one.
Regarding OS, an even larger variety of factors with
possible impact have been described in the literature, in￾cluding gender [23], number of lesions [22], lesion
diameter [15, 23], GTV volume [16, 17] and dose [24]
for HCC and/or MD as well as Child-Pugh stage for
HCC [17, 24] and histology for MD [16, 22]. However,
the prognostic value of those factors is far from being
consistently evident as negative or even opposing results
have been reported also for any of the mentioned factors
[15, 16, 20, 21, 23, 25]. In our study, we identified the
number of lesions and performance status as factors as￾sociated with OS for the entire cohort. In the HCC sub￾group Child-Pugh stage and gender were additional
factors with significant impact. Although conflicting data
exists, it seems reasonable to assume that patients with
multiple lesions are at higher risk for the development
of consecutive lesions with consequently reduced sur￾vival, especially in a patient group like ours with limited
salvage options. This is further supported by our data
with regard to the clearly reduced FFHF in patients with
multiple lesions. The same assumption seems true for
performance status which has been shown in many
other oncological situations to be a key factor in predict￾ing outcome [26, 27]. Regarding the HCC subgroup, it
has been shown that OS is clearly associated with
Child-Pugh stage [28]. It therefore seems no surprise
that OS of patients with HCC lesions (which developed
on the basis of advanced liver cirrhosis) is affected by
the severity of the underlying cirrhosis. In contrast, the
observed negative influence of female gender on OS of

HCC patients is difficult to explain. Huertas et al. [23]
reported a similar result in their HCC series even ac￾cording to multivariate analysis, however Yamashita et
al. [25] found the opposite association leaving this ques￾tion unanswered.
Toxicity
Given the high rate of outfield failures with the need for
salvage treatments, toxicity and preservation of liver
function are of important value in the decision process
for locally-ablative treatments. With our approach, we
observed high treatment compliance with predominantly
mild toxicities mainly including fatigue and nausea.
Three patients with HCC (11%) developed marked de￾terioration of liver function. Similar results have been
published in most other series. For patients treated for
MD, acute and late grade3+ toxicities are reported in the
range of 0–16% and 0–5% [3]. Similar to our results,
Andratschke et al. [16] reported mild side effects mainly
consisting of fatigue and nausea but no grade3+ reac￾tions in their series of 74 patients treated with compar￾able dose and fractionation concepts. In patients with
HCC higher complications rates have been observed.
Acute grade3+ toxicities ranged from 5 to 37% including
up to 7% deaths [4], mainly in Child-Pugh B patients.
Decline in Child-Pugh class has also been reported in
13–29% [12, 20, 24], although some authors described a
marked recovery over time [20]. Our toxicity rate seem
to compare favorably with those rates, however some of
these studies included larger lesions resulting in more
dose to normal liver tissue and a higher percentage of
Child-Pugh B patients. Both factors have been shown to
be associated with toxicity [24, 29]. For example Ando￾lino et al. [24] described progressive liver dysfunction in
4/8 patients with Child-Pugh≥8 of whom 2 could be sal￾vaged by transplant but 2 died. They concluded to fur￾ther treat Child-Pugh B patients only if listed for
transplantation. Lasley et al. [29] observed grade 3/4
liver toxicity of 11% in patients with Child-Pugh A com￾pared to 38% in Child-Pugh B patients and further ex￾cluded patients with Child-Pugh≥8 from treatment.
Finally, Culleton et al. [30] analyzed specifically patients
with Child-Pugh B/C and described a decline of ≥2
points in 63% at 3 months. Therefore SBRT treatment
should be used with caution or restricted in dose in pa￾tients with already restricted pretreatment liver function
(Child Pugh B) while SBRT seems to be generally well
tolerated in patients with Child Pugh A or in patients
with MD. Moreover, a recent systematic review includ￾ing 5 studies with 392 patients suffering from primary
and secondary liver tumors treated with SBRT demon￾strated well-preserved post-treatment quality-of-life at
least comparable or even favorable compared to other
surgical or non-surgical approaches [1].
Limitations
Clearly our analysis has some limitations, namely its
retrospective nature, the small sample size, the mixed
cohort and the rather short follow-up. However, in the
absence of prospective randomized trials and only a lim￾ited number of prospective studies reported in the litera￾ture our experience may help clinicians and researchers
to guide their further decisions.
Conclusions
SBRT resulted in high LC and acceptable survival rates
in patients with HCC or MD not amendable to other
locally-ablative treatments. However, especially patients
with multiple lesions are at high risk for intrahepatic
outfield failures indicating a possible need for additional
therapies. OS was predicted by number of lesions and
performance status as well as pretreatment liver function
in HCC patients. Toxicity was generally mild. High
grade toxicity was restricted to patients with HCC suf￾fering from underlying cirrhosis Child-Pugh class B indi￾cating the need for special attention in those patients.
