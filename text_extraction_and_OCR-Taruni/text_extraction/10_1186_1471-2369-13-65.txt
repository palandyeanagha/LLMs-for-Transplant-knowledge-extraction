end-stage renal disease: a population-based
case–control study

Abstract
Background: Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) have elevated cancer risk. Cancer risk increases with age,
but associations of ESRD with specific malignancies are incompletely studied for older individuals.
Methods: We conducted a population-based case–control study (1,029,695 cancer and 99,610 controls) among the
U.S. elderly using SEER-Medicare linked data. We defined ESRD as presence of dialysis claims in the 3 months prior
to selection.
Results: Although ESRD was not associated with excess cancer risk overall (odds ratio 1.02; 95%CI 0.91-1.14), risk
was specifically increased for cancers of the stomach (1.45; 1.16-1.81), small intestine (1.92; 1.27-2.92), colon (1.17;
1.00-1.36), liver (1.53; 1.16-2.01), biliary tract (1.78; 1.20-2.65), lung (1.17; 1.02-1.34), cervix (2.12; 1.39-3.23), kidney (2.42;
2.01-2.92), and for multiple myeloma (1.77; 1.40-2.24) and chronic myeloid leukemia (1.74; 1.08-2.80). The association
between liver cancer and ESRD was attenuated upon adjustment for hepatitis B and C infection or diabetes
mellitus. Multiple myeloma risk was highest with short ESRD duration (p < 0.0001), possibly reflecting reverse
causality, while kidney cancer risk showed a borderline rise over time (p = 0.08).
Conclusions: Among elderly individuals with ESRD, the excess risks for some cancers may reflect immune
dysfunction or a high prevalence of other risk factors, such as viral infections or diabetes mellitus. Our results
underscore the need for studying biological pathways of carcinogenesis in ESRD.

Background
In 2009, a total of 571,414 people within the U.S. were
living with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) [1]. ESRD in￾cidence increases with age, and therefore the prevalence
of ESRD is growing most quickly among individuals
aged sixty five and older, such that 36% of individuals
living with ESRD in the U.S. in 2009 were at least
65 years old [1]. ESRD patients are at high risk of
hospitalization and death due to infection, especially
related to vascular access, septicemia, and pneumonia;
uremia; and cardiovascular disease, which might be
attributed to immune system abnormalities in ESRD
patients [2,3].
In addition, ESRD patients seem to a have modestly
increased risk of cancer, with overall standardized inci￾dence ratios (SIRs, which measure risk relative to the gen￾eral population) ranging from 0.9 to 1.5 [4-10].
Malignancies for which risk may be more substantially
increased include cancers of the kidney, bladder, and thy￾roid; multiple myeloma; and virus-related malignancies,
specifically Kaposi sarcoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma,
and Hodgkin lymphoma. A large multi-national study
used U.S. data from the United States Renal Disease Sys￾tem (USRDS) and incorporated Medicare claims records
to ascertain the occurrence of cancer [5]. This approach
was limited by potential inaccuracies in Medicare claims
for cancer diagnoses, leading to possible confusion be￾tween incident and prevalent cancers [11]. The study

reported an elevated risk for cancer among individuals
with ESRD and documented attenuation with advancing
age in the magnitude of this association. However, the
authors did not present results for individual cancer types
separately for people who were age 65 years or older [5].
The potential association of ESRD and cancer risk is
particularly important for the elderly, because with the
aging of the U.S. population, there is an increase in the
number and proportion of older adults living with ESRD,
and also because the incidence of most cancers increases
with age. However, because the epidemiology of cancer
among elderly ESRD patients has not been evaluated in
detail, it is unclear whether ESRD increases cancer risk
in this population, and if so, for which cancers the in￾crease is present. We therefore conducted the present
study, using linked data from cancer registries and
Medicare, to assess cancer risk related to ESRD among
elderly individuals in the U.S.
Methods
SEER-Medicare dataset
This study evaluates cancer risk in elderly ESRD patients
living in Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results
(SEER) cancer registry areas. The National Cancer
Institute oversees and supports the SEER program
(http://seer.cancer.gov/) which is a consortium of U.S.
population-based cancer registries. SEER originated in
1973 and over time expanded registry coverage to
nearly 26% of the U.S. population. Medicare is a fed￾erally sponsored insurance program that provides pri￾mary health insurance for approximately 97% of the
U.S. population aged 65 years and older. In addition,
Medicare covers individuals with ESRD or disability
regardless of their age (http://www.cms.hhs.gov/).
Details of the SEER-Medicare dataset (http://healthser￾vices.cancer.gov/seermedicare/) have been published
elsewhere [11]. Briefly, the SEER-Medicare database
links data on SEER cancer cases with Medicare to re￾trieve claims data on Medicare-covered individuals. The
SEER registry data contain demographic and clinical
information on all incident cancer cases. Medicare data
include claims from 1986 forward for inpatient hospitali￾zations (Part A), and 1991 forward for physician and
outpatient services (Part B). These claims use Inter￾national Classification of Diseases (ICD-9), current pro￾cedures terminology (CPT-4) codes, and revenue center
codes to bill for services and related diagnoses. Compar￾able Medicare data are also available for a cohort of
cancer-free individuals comprising a 5% random sample
of Medicare beneficiaries residing in SEER areas.
Study design and subject selection
We used the SEER-Medicare data to conduct a
population-based case–control study of risk of cancer
among the elderly. As described in detail elsewhere [12],
this study design is equivalent to a cohort study of Medi￾care recipients, from which we selected all cancer cases
and a random sample of cancer-free individuals, and it
has the advantage of computational efficiency. Thus, we
identified all cancer cases from individuals diagnosed in
SEER with a first malignancy during 1992–2005 who
were aged 66–99 years at diagnosis. Cases were required
to have at least 12 months of Medicare data prior to
diagnosis (1 year of prior Part A, Part B Medicare cover￾age while not enrolled in a health maintenance orga￾nization [HMO]) so that there was sufficient time in
which to identify ESRD information prior to the cancer
diagnosis. We excluded individuals whose cancer was
diagnosed only on autopsy or death certificate, since
these cases might be incidental or have atypical behavior.
We excluded cancer cases from the analysis if they had a
prior Medicare claim indicating a history of organ trans￾plant or were ever infected with human immunodefi￾ciency virus, to assure that cases were not due to known
causes of immunosuppression. Cancers were classified
using International Classification of Diseases for Oncol￾ogy (third edition, ICD-O3) topography and morphology
codes and grouped using the SEER “site recode with
Kaposi sarcoma and mesothelioma.”
We randomly selected 100,000 controls from the 5%
sample of Medicare beneficiaries living in SEER areas to
match the total group of cancer cases. Specifically, con￾trols were required, as of July 1 in the calendar year of
selection, to be alive, free of any SEER-reported malig￾nancies, and have at least 12 months of prior non-HMO,
Part A, Part B Medicare coverage. From this eligible
group, we then selected controls who were frequency
matched to the entire group of cancer cases by individ￾ual calendar year of diagnosis, gender, and age in five
categories (66–69, 70–74, 75–79, 80–84, 85–99 years). A
subject could be selected as a control multiple times for
cases in different calendar years and could later become
a cancer case. Following selection of 100,000 controls,
we excluded individuals if they had a prior Medicare
claim of organ transplant or were ever infected with
human immunodeficiency virus.
Ascertainment of ESRD and other medical conditions
For each case and control subject, we defined ESRD to
be present based on Medicare claims for chronic dialysis
care that was consistent with ESRD. We used this ascer￾tainment tactic because there were no ICD-9 diagnosis
codes in the Medicare claims files specific to ESRD. Spe￾cifically, we required that a claim from a physician or
hospital outpatient facility include one of the following
codes: CPT-4 code for dialysis of 90925 (ESRD service
for full month), 90935–90937 (hemodialysis service with
physician evaluation), 90945–90947 (dialysis [other than
Shebl et al. BMC Nephrology 2012, 13:65 Page 2 of 8
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2369/13/65

hemodialysis] service with physician evaluation), 90966
(services for home dialysis), or 90997–90999 (hemoper￾fusion, unlisted dialysis procedure); or revenue center
codes 0821–0825, 0829–0835, 0839–0845, 0849–0855,
or 0859. We required a minimum of one ESRD or dialy￾sis claim in each of the three months immediately prior
to cancer diagnosis or control selection. Our list of
codes is similar to those used previously by Taneja et al.
to study the distribution of cancer stages among ESRD
patients [13], but it is more restrictive, because Taneja
et al. required the presence of codes for both chronic
renal disease and dialysis, whereas we did not require
both types of codes but required repeated claims over
three months.
For each individual, we searched Medicare claims files
for other conditions related to ESRD or specific cancers.
These conditions included obesity (ICD-9: 278.0x),
diabetes mellitus (250.0x), hypertension (401.x-405.x),
peptic ulcer (531.x-534.x), alcoholic liver disease (571.0-
571.3), hepatitis C virus infection (HCV, 070.41, 070.44,
070.51, 070.54, 070.70, 070.71, V02.62), hepatitis B virus
infection (HBV, 070.2, 070.3), hemochromatosis (275.0),
cholelithiasis (574.x), pernicious anemia (281.0, 281.1),
regional enteritis (555.x), ulcerative colitis (556.x), di￾verticular disease (562.x), and various kidney diseases
(753.x, 580.x-584.x, 587). Conditions were determined
to be present based on Medicare claims in inpatient,
outpatient, or physician files. We excluded the 3-year
period prior to cancer diagnosis/selection to focus on
conditions that were longstanding and therefore most
likely relevant to modify the association between ESRD
and cancer risk.
Statistical analysis
To compare ESRD prevalence in cancer cases and con￾trols, we utilized unconditional logistic regression mod￾els to obtain odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence
intervals (CIs). We fitted separate logistic models for
each cancer type and used all controls in each analysis.
For cancers that were found to be associated with ESRD,
we assessed cancer risk according to the apparent dur￾ation of ESRD based on the date of the earliest support￾ing Medicare claim. We also evaluated models that
adjusted for the presence of other medical conditions
related to ESRD or the cancers of interest.
All logistic models were adjusted for age, gender, cal￾endar year of cancer diagnosis/control selection, and
race. In addition, we adjusted the OR variance to accom￾modate the repeated selection of individuals as controls,
and the selection of some controls who later served as
cases [12]. To avoid sparse data and because the SEER￾Medicare data use agreement prevents presenting results
for 10 subjects or fewer, we did not analyze data for can￾cers with fewer than 3000 cases (based on an ESRD
prevalence of 0.3% in controls, this number corresponds
to an expected 10 cancer cases with ESRD under the
null hypothesis of no association). For prostate cancer,
we also show associations with ESRD stratified by stage
of cancer diagnosis and according to whether a prior
Medicare claim for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test￾ing was present.
Results
The study included 1,029,732 cancer cases and 99,615
controls (Table 1). Cases and controls were well￾matched on age, gender, race/ethnicity, and calendar
year. The majority of subjects were non-Hispanic whites
(cases 86%, controls 84%), with a median age of 76 years
in cases and 75 years in controls.
ESRD was reported in 3,582 (0.35%) cancer cases and
357 (0.36%) controls. ESRD was thus not associated with
an overall increase risk of cancer (OR 1.02, 95% CI 0.91-
1.14; Table 2). Based on the earliest Medicare claim for
ESRD or dialysis, the median duration of ESRD was
25 months (interquartile range 12–45) in cases and
25 months (interquartile range 14–43) in controls.
Nonetheless, with respect to specific cancers (Table 2),
ESRD was associated with significantly elevated risk for
cancers of the stomach (OR 1.45), small intestine (1.92),
colon (1.17), liver (1.53), biliary tract (1.78), lung (1.17),
and cervix (2.12), as well as for multiple myeloma (1.77)
and chronic myeloid leukemia (1.74). As shown in

Table 2, elevated risk was present for cancers of the kid￾ney and renal pelvis (OR 2.31), but this increase was lim￾ited to cancers of the kidney itself (OR 2.42) and was
not significant for the renal pelvis (OR 1.13). Among the
kidney cancers, 18,707 (90.4%) were renal cell carcin￾omas, 633 (3.1%) were transitional cell carcinomas, and
1,344 (6.5%) were other/unspecified subtypes. Among
renal pelvis cancers, 2,164 (93.5%) were transitional cell
carcinomas, and 115 (5.0%) were other/unspecified sub￾types. Analysis of these specific histologic subtypes of
kidney and renal pelvis cancers revealed an excess risk
for renal cell carcinoma in association with ESRD
(N = 18,743 cases, OR 2.38, 95% CI 1.96-2.89), but not
for transitional cell carcinoma (N = 2,797 cases, OR 0.93,
95% CI 0.46-1.87). In contrast, ESRD was associated
with reduced risk for prostate cancer (OR 0.42) and
non-Hodgkin lymphoma (OR 0.77) (Table 2).
Of all these cancers, only multiple myeloma showed a
significant change in risk with duration of ESRD. For
multiple myeloma, there was a substantial decline with
prolonged ESRD, such that risk was highest immediately
after the first Medicare claim for dialysis, with ORs of
3.74 in the 0–12 months, 1.89 in the 12–25 months,
0.89 in the 25–44 months, and 0.79 in the 44+ months
after first claim (p < 0.001). There was a borderline trend
of increasing risk of kidney cancer with longer duration
of ESRD (ORs 1.85 in the 0–12 months, 1.75 in the12-
25 months, 1.61 in the 25–44 months, and 3.57 in the
44+ months after first claim, p = 0.08).
We evaluated whether associations with ESRD were
affected when we adjusted for the presence of other
medical conditions. Adjustment for the presence of
obesity did not change the observed associations with
ESRD for any cancers (data not shown). Likewise, asso￾ciations with ESRD were not materially affected when
we made the following model-based adjustments (data
not shown): risks of stomach and esophagus cancers
when adjusted for history of peptic ulcer or pernicious
anemia; risk of colon cancer when adjusted for diverticu￾lar disease, ulcerative colitis or regional enteritis; risks of
renal and urinary bladder cancers when adjusted for his￾tory of kidney disease or hypertension; and risk of biliary
tract cancer upon adjusting for the presence of
gallstones.
For liver cancer, the association with ESRD remained
significant after adjustment for alcoholic liver disease or
hemochromatosis (data not shown). However, the asso￾ciation between ESRD and liver cancer was attenuated
after adjustment for HBV, HCV infection, or diabetes
mellitus (adjusted ORs 1.25, 1.13, and 1.15 respectively).
We also examined associations with ESRD for prostate
cancer according to cancer stage. ESRD patients mani￾fested a reduced risk of localized/regional cancer (OR
0.34), but not risk of distant/metastatic (OR 0.89) or
unstaged cancer (OR 0.84) (Table 3) Among controls,
men with ESRD were less likely than men without ESRD
to have a claim for a PSA test in the one-year period
prior to selection (24.1% vs. 35.5%, OR 0.58, 95% CI

0.43-0.78). Among prostate cancer cases, a claim for
PSA testing was present in the year prior to diagnosis in
59.2% and 67.9% (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.55-0.85) of those
with and without ESRD, respectively. Risk of prostate
cancer (in particular, localized/regional cancer) was sig￾nificantly lower among individuals with ESRD compared
to controls regardless of their screening status (Table 3).
Discussion
In this population-based case–control study among eld￾erly adults, we found that ESRD was not associated with
an overall increased risk of cancer. These results differ
from those seen in most previous studies [5,6,14], which
have shown a modest overall increased risk of cancer.
This difference may be explained by the restriction of
our study to elderly adults. As noted above, Maisonneuve
et al. reported an attenuation with age in the association
between ESRD and cancer risk, such that in the U.S. the
overall SIR for cancer declined from 4.6 for those whose
age at first dialysis was <35 years to 1.1 for individuals
who were age 65 years or older [5]. This overall attenu￾ation could be due to the increase of background cancer
rates with age, but the results likely differ for individual
cancer types.
Indeed, although overall cancer risk was not elevated
in association with ESRD, we did see increased risks for
certain cancers such as cancers of stomach, small intes￾tine, colon, liver, biliary tract, lung, cervix, and kidney,
as well as for multiple myeloma and chronic myeloid
leukemia, where risks were elevated 1.16 to 2.40-fold.
Among cancers of the kidney and pelvis, we found an ap￾proximately 3-fold excess of renal cell carcinoma but no
increase for transitional cell carcinoma. Previous studies
reported an excess risk of several of these malignancies,
including multiple myeloma and bladder and kidney can￾cers [4-6,15,16]. Some prior studies found increased risks
for other cancer that we did not find associated with
ESRD, including thyroid cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma
(for which we found a modest inverse association),
Hodgkin lymphoma, and Kaposi sarcoma [5,14]. Again,
the differing magnitudes of association between prior
studies and our study could potentially be attributed to
our subjects’ advanced age, while other studies included
a wider age range.
Notably, the increased risks that we observed for sev￾eral infection-related cancers (i.e., liver, stomach, and
cervical cancers) could reflect immunodeficiency asso￾ciated with ESRD. Chronic uremia leads to metabolic
abnormalities that alter the immune response such that
antigen-presenting cell (APC) function is impaired,
lymphocyte survival is shortened, proliferation of T-cells
is impaired, together with an increased suppressor T-cell
activity, decreased helper T-cell (Th) activity, and
increased Th1/Th2 ratio [2,3]. Nutritional abnormalities
that are prevalent among individuals with ESRD, such as
selenium deficiency, reduced glutathione peroxidase ac￾tivity, and vitamin D deficiency [17-20] could also play a
role in development of cancer, particularly for colon can￾cer [21-23]. Individuals with ESRD commonly receive
erythropoietin for treatment of anemia, which might be
implicated in carcinogenesis and could potentially ex￾plain some of the observed excess cancer risk among
individuals with ESRD [24].
However, arguing against a biological effect underlying
some of these associations, we did not observe an in￾crease in cancer risk with longer duration of ESRD. An￾other possibility is that, rather than reflecting the effects
of ESRD itself, the high risk of some cancers may arise
from a high prevalence of established cancer risk factors
(e.g., infections with human papillomavirus [cervical
cancer], HBV and HCV [liver cancer], or tobacco use
[lung cancer]) [25-28]. Indeed, this possibility is sup￾ported by our observation that the association between
ESRD and liver cancer was attenuated after we adjusted
for HCV infection, HBV infection, or diabetes mellitus.
In addition, excess risks were observed for malignan￾cies (i.e., bladder and kidney cancers, multiple myeloma)
that could directly lead to ESRD or are related to such
conditions. Cancers of the renal pelvis and bladder may
be attributed to excess analgesic consumption, a cause
of renal failure [9,29,30]. Likewise, polycystic kidney dis￾ease, a cause of renal failure, predisposes to renal cell
carcinoma [31,32]. Nonetheless, ESRD itself probably
causes some kidney cancers, as the development of

multiple renal cysts during dialysis, with the subsequent
occurrence of renal cell carcinoma, is well-described
[33-40]. This notion is further supported by the study of
Maisonneuve et al. [5] that detected an increased risk of
kidney cancer with increasing duration of dialysis.
In contrast, the strong increase in multiple myeloma
risk in the first 1–2 years after ESRD diagnosis, and de￾clining risk over longer time intervals, could be attribu￾ted to reverse causality, such that multiple myeloma
leads to renal failure. This situation could arise if mul￾tiple myeloma was undiagnosed at initiation of dialysis,
or if the diagnosis date is in error in the cancer registry
due to delayed reporting. Maisonneuve et al. also noted
the excess of multiple myeloma cases and likewise attrib￾uted this observation to prevalent cases [5]. Finally,
treatment of glomerulonephritis with azathioprine or
cyclophosphamide may predispose to certain types of
cancers such as kidney cancer, bladder cancer, and mul￾tiple myeloma [41,42].
Our findings of markedly low risk of prostate cancer
deserve comment. A biologically protective effect of
ESRD seems unlikely, because the inverse association
was present only for localized cancer and not for distant/
metastatic cancer. We believe that the inverse associ￾ation instead may be a manifestation of screening.
Recommendations for prostate cancer screening using
PSA testing and digital rectal examination are presently
in flux, but screening has typically been considered only
for men who have an extended life expectancy. One pos￾sibility is that, due to their lower life expectancy, men
with ESRD do not receive screening with the PSA test as
frequently as other men, which could lead to an appar￾ent deficit of prostate cancer. Indeed, it is estimated that
40% of prostate cancer cases in the U.S. are detected
through PSA testing [43]. Among controls, we found a
lower prevalence of claims for testing among men with
ESRD, which supports that the apparent diminished risk
is partly due to lack of screening. However, we also
found a lower risk for prostate cancer associated with
ESRD among men who received PSA testing, which
could potentially be explained by decreased sensitivity of
PSA testing in men with ESRD. This notion is supported
by Bruun et al. [44], who reported that individuals with
chronic kidney disease have elevated levels of free PSA,
which is interpreted (when the total PSA is elevated) to
indicate the presence of benign prostate disease. In
addition, the association between ESRD and reduced risk
of prostate cancer among apparently unscreened men
may partly reflect confounding due to unmeasured
screening that we did not capture. In summary, we be￾lieve that the reduced risk of localized/regional prostate
cancer in men with ESRD may be explained by less fre￾quent screening or reduced sensitivity of screening.
However, we do not advocate for increasing the
frequency of screening among men with ESRD. Recently
the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF),
opposed the use of PSA for prostate cancer screening re￾gardless of age because the harms overweigh the benefits
[45]. Given, the overall poor survival of men with ESRD,
PSA-based prostate cancer screening will not be of add￾itional value.
Our study has several important strengths, including
the ability to assess all type of cancers and its large size.
Our study is representative of the elderly U.S. popula￾tion, since it includes all cancers from SEER cancer
registries and a random sample of controls with Medi￾care from the same geographic areas [12]. The use of
SEER allowed comprehensive ascertainment of the oc￾currence of cancers, since these cancer registries achieve
largely complete surveillance and provide high-quality
data on incident cancers.
Limitations of our study should also be noted. For in￾stance, SEER does not capture squamous cell and basal
cell carcinoma of the skin. In addition, we were unable
to assess cancer risk in people younger than 66 years
old, so our results are not generalizable to a younger
population. Furthermore, because ESRD is somewhat
uncommon, we may have missed some associations with
cancer. Ascertainment of ESRD in our study was likely
complete, because Medicare pays for dialysis care for
most U.S. ESRD patients. Our use of Medicare claims is
supported by the similar prevalence of ESRD among our
controls and reported by the USRDS program for the
same age group (0.31% of our controls vs. 0.21-0.44%
during 1992–2005) [46]. However, because we used dia￾lysis claims to identify people with ESRD, we may have
inadvertently included some people with less severe kid￾ney disease. In addition, we did not have the capability
to fully determine duration of ESRD because Medicare
claims were only available starting in 1991. Another
limitation that should be considered is the possibility
that competing mortality from secondary complications
of dialysis would attenuate the association between
ESRD and cancer. This effect would occur in any study
of the ESRD population, and the results should be inter￾preted to reflect risk of cancer among surviving patients.
A final limitation is that we made multiple comparisons,
and some associations might be due to chance. Fewer
associations would be statistically significant using a
conservative p-value threshold of 0.002 (based on a Bon￾ferroni correction for 31 cancer types, see Table 2).
Our results may help inform clinical decisions about
cancer screening. Given the lower risk of prostate can￾cer in men with ESRD, and the lower life expectancy of
these men relative to the general population there is no
indication that men with ESRD should receive PSA
testing. These findings also do not support more ag￾gressive screening for other common cancers, because
Shebl et al. BMC Nephrology 2012, 13:65 Page 6 of 8
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2369/13/65

there was no increased risk for breast cancer, and only
a modest increase in colon cancer risk. Similarly, others
have suggested that in the circumstances of high mor￾bidity and mortality from other diseases, screening for
kidney cervical, colon, and breast cancers is less cost￾effective than other health interventions in the ESRD
population [47-49].
Conclusions
In conclusion, we conducted the first comprehensive
population-based study of cancer risk associated with
ESRD in the elderly. Our results document an elevated
risk of some types of malignancy. Additional research on
the etiologic roles of disturbed immunity, viral infec￾tions, and the biological pathways underlying the devel￾opment of cancer in ESRD is needed.
