A review and selection of simple laboratory methods
used for the study of glycosaminoglycan excretion
and the diagnosis of the mucopolysaccharidoses

From the Department of Child Health, University of Bristol
smNopsis The current state of knowledge on the biochemical abnormalities in the mucopoly￾saccharidoses is reviewed. Methods for the estimation and identification of glycosaminoglycans
excreted in the mucopolysaccharidoses are discussed and a selection of simple and reliable methods
of value in a small hospital laboratory have been given in detail in an appendix.
The mucopolysaccharidoses are a rare group of
inherited disorders of connective tissue metabolism
of which the condition most familiar to clinicians is
Hurler's syndrome (previously given the unpleasant
name 'gargoylism' due to the unusual facial appear￾ance). The clinical features have been reviewed by
McKusick and others (McKusick et al, 1965;
McKusick, 1969, 1972). These disorders have long
been known to be associated with excessive muco￾polysaccharide excretion (Dorfman and Lorincz,
1957; Meyer et al, 1958). The term mucopoly￾saccharide, although still retained in medical litera￾ture, does lead to confusion between polysaccharides
containing both hexosamines and hexuronic acids
and a variety of mucins and other mucosubstances
which do not contain hexuronic acids. Jeanloz (1960)
introduced the term glycosaminoglycuronans (GAG)
for the acidic polysaccharides only, and the current
nomenclature and suitable abbreviations for these
compounds are given in table I. Knowledge of the
detailed structure of these compounds has been re￾viewed by Muir (1969) and Dorfman and Matalon
(1972) and is sununarized in table II. The amino
sugar residues may be N-acetylated, N-sulphated or
0-sulphated at carbon 4 or carbon 6. In the interests
of clarity, the trivial names of the residues will be
used throughout the rest of this article, for example,
2-acetamido-2-deoxy-ot-D-glucopyranose will be
referred to as N-acetylglucosamine.
In 1964 Van Hoof and Hers identified the muco￾polysaccharidoses as lysosomal storage disorders by
electron microscopy, and since that date it has be￾come increasingly apparent that they are due to
genetic defects in the synthesis and activity of

cultured fibroblasts from patients with mucopoly￾sacchridoses, in the presence of 35S-labelled sul￾phate, and showed increased accumulation and de￾layed release of label in abnormal cells compared
with normal controls and concluded that this indi￾cated defective degradation of synthesized GAG.

cell type to the other; these factors were found in the
supernatant fluid and have since been isolated from

normal human urine. Their enzymic nature was sug￾gested by Cantz et al (1970, 1972) and Bach et al
(1972).
Recently, a number of specific enzyme defects
have been identified and have led to a slight modifica￾tion of the earlier classifications (McKusick, 1972).
The current state of knowledge on enzyme defects
is summarized in table III. The importance of these
recent enzyme discoveries is threefold:
1. With suitable assay procedures they should enable
an unequivocal diagnosis of the different muco￾polysaccharidoses to be made.
2. Enzyme assays on cultured amniotic fluid cells
will enable early intrauterine diagnosis to be
made.
3. Suitable enzyme-replacement therapy may be
possible.
However, at the time of writing, enzyme assays are
not widely used for diagnosis because suitable sub￾strates are not readily available (with the exception
of p-nitrophenyl-o-D-glucosamine for type III B),
and substrate preparation and the culture of tissue
cells are difficult and time-consuming. Urine
analysis for excessive and abnormal GAG excre￾tion is, therefore, likely to remain important for some
time to come as the initial diagnostic test.
An extensive literature has developed in recent
years on methods used for detection and evaluation
of abnormal GAG excretion. Most have been
developed in research laboratories and require
special apparatus and expertise not usually available
in clinical chemistry departments. As a result many
laboratories are reluctant to enter this field owing to
a belief that the methodology required is too elabo￾rate. It is the purpose of this article to discuss a
number of simple procedures which are reliable and
adequate for diagnostic purposes and to recommend
those which the author has found to be most useful.
The latter are described in detail in the appendix.
The Sample
The diagnosis of mucopolysaccharidoses is most
likely to be required in early childhood when 24-
hour specimens of urine are difficult to collect. The
problem of incomplete collections may be overcome

Simple laboratory methods usedfor the study ofglycosaminoglycan excretion
by relating GAG excretion to creatinine excretion,
and this may be done on random samples of urine
collected from outpatients. Although creatinine
excretion varies during a 24-hour period and the
GAG/creatinine ratio is increased at night (Di
Ferrante and Lipscomb, 1970), the excretion of both
substances remains fairly constant during waking
hours (say 0900-1800 hours) and the GAG/creatinine
ratios in samples obtained during this period are
similar to those obtained on complete 24-hour urine
collections (Pennock et al, 1973).
Infected samples should not be used, but some
preservatives may interfere with the analyses, eg,
thymol interferes with some screening tests and
toluene lowers the efficiency of precipitation methods
(Di Ferrante, 1967). Their use is best avoided if
possible, and the author prefers samples to be frozen
solid as soon as possible after collection, and kept
frozen during transport to the laboratory and while
awaiting analysis. However, freezing is not essential,
and adequate diagnostic information can be gained
from the analysis of samples which have been sent
through the post provided the sample is not
infected. For postal delivery, the author requests
three or more random samples of urine collected at
different times; all non-infected samples can be
pooled, and this usually gives enough material for a
full qualitative analysis if necessary (see below).
Some urine samples may be very concentrated,
which may lead to inadequate isolation of GAG and
hence error in quantitative analyses (Di Ferrante,
1967). The sample should be diluted with distilled
water to lower the specific gravity to below 1020
before any tests, including estimation of creatinine,
are done. Very dilute samples of low specific gravity
and creatinine content should be discarded since
small errors in the estimation of the latter may give
false positive or false negative results.
Screening Tests
The main objectives in selecting any chemical screen￾ing test should be that the test (1) should never give
a false negative result, (2) is easy and quick to per￾form, and (3) gives a minimum number of false
positive results which would require further analysis.
Although a large number of screening tests have been
devised, the majority fail on at least one of these
criteria, mainly because they take no account of
urine concentration. If an identical volume of urine
is used in each case, a concentrated urine from a
normal individual may give a false positive result
while a dilute urine from a patient with a mucopoly￾saccharidosis will give a false negative result.
Screening tests fall into two main categories, paper
spot tests based on the interaction of urinary GAG
with a suitable cationic dye, and precipitation tests
based on the interaction of GAG with acidified
albumin, quaternary ammonium compounds, or
alcian blue.
Spot Tests
A number of paper spot tests have been described
in which a fixed volume of urine is applied to filter
paper, dried, and stained with a solution of suitable
dye. The dyes used have included toluidine blue
(Berry and Spinanger, 1960), alcian blue (Carson and
Neill, 1962; Procopsis et al, 1968), and azur A
(Berman et al, 1971). None of these tests takes urine
concentration or age-related changes in GAG excre￾tion into account. Carter et al (1968) found 31-5 Y.
false negative results using toluidine blue to test 54
urine samples from patients with Hurler's syndrome,
and Procopsis et al (1968) found a false negative
result using alcian blue. Allowing for the urine
concentration by spotting a urine volume containing
a fixed amount of creatinine does not climinate
false negative results. The method using azur A
(Berman et al, 1971) was based on a study of only 17
samples. This test does not take urine concen￾tration into account, and the recommended pro￾cedure seems unlikely to be an improvement on the
other screening tests.
In view of the high incidence of false negative
results, paper spot tests should not be used as screen￾ing tests for the mucopolysaccharidoses.
Precipitation Tests
The interaction of GAG with acidified bovine
albumin to form a flocculent precipitate has also
been used as a screening test (Dorfman, 1958;
Denny and Dutton, 1962). This test also does not
take urine concentration into account, and false
negative results have been found in three patients
with Hurler's syndrome and three patients with
Sanfilippo syndrome using the test in its original
form (Pennock et al, 1973). Even when refined by
quantitative measurement of the turbidity (Steiness,
1961) false negative results have also been found in
9-2% of samples from patients with Hurler's syn￾drome (Carter et al, 1968) and in patients with
Sanfilippo syndrome (Lewis et al, 1974).
The observation that GAG will react with quater￾nary ammonium compounds to give a precipitate
(Scott, 1960) has also been used as a screening test.
Renuart (1966) added a buffered solution of cetyl￾trimetryl ammonium bromide (CTAB) to urine and
observed a flocculent precipitate after 30 minutes in
samples with high GAG content. In the author's
experience this test is often difficult to interpret since

normal urines frequently give a peculiar precipitate
and a true flocculent precipitate is so rarely seen that
it is difficult to explain to an inexperienced observer
what to look for.
A semiquantitative test in which cetylpyridinium
chloride (CPC) is added to urine and the turbidity
recorded was described by Manley and Hawksworth
(1966). They found that timing was critical since
aggregation of particles occurred after four minutes.
They also found that results changed with age
throughout childhood, but again this test does not
take urine concentration into account.
Precipitation of GAG with CPC or CTAB is
affected by ionic strength and pH (Scott, 1960) as
well as by concentration and, if these factors are not
taken into account, urine samples may give false
positive or false negative results. The effects of ionic
strength and pH can be overcome by buffering the
CPC solution, and the use of citrate buffer at pH
4-8 (Pennock, 1969) also overcomes the critical time
dependence of the CPC test as described by Manley
and Hawksworth (1966). The inclusion of standards
enables a quantitative result to be obtained. It is
essential that allowance is made for urine concentra￾tion effects by relating the results to the creatinine
content of the sample, and that it is appreciated that
GAG excretion changes with age throughout child￾hood so that the correct normal range can be used
(Pennock, 1969). The CPC citrate test has the follow￾ing advantages over other screening tests:
1. The effects of differences in ionic strength and
pH of the sample are overcome.
2. The precipitate is stabilized so that timing of
the reaction is less critical.
3. It is quantitative and thus lends itself to quality
control.
4. By relating results to creatinine, account is
taken of urine concentration.
5. It may be applied to random urine samples.
6. The test has not been known to give false
negative results even in patients with Sanfilippo
syndrome when other screening tests have failed
(Pennock, 1973; B. Turner-personal communica￾tion).
7. The incidence of false positive results is ac￾ceptable; 5% in the first year of life and 2.6% in
older children were found in one study of 3000
children (Pennock et al, 1973) and 3-6% in another
study of 1000 children (Valdivieso et al, 1973).
It is for these reasons that the CPC citrate test is
given in more detail as the screening method of
choice in the appendix.
Quantitative Estimtion of Urinary GAG
Quantitative estimation is based on measurement of
hexuronic acid residues which all the GAG contain,
except keratan sulphate. Separation of GAG from
interfering substances has been achieved in a number
of ways. Hexuronic acid may be measured on the
dialysed sample directly (Segni et al, 1964;
Rosenfeld, 1971) or after a further purification step,
such as fractionation on ECTEOLA cellulose
columns, which enables sulphated and non-sulphated
GAG to be measured separately (Wessler, 1967;
Blackham and Raine, 1970), or by precipitation with
CTAB or CPC (Thompson and Castor, 1966; Teller
et al, 1962) or aminoacridine (Bitter et al, 1970;
Dean et al, 1971). CPC and CTAB are poor pre￾cipitants of GAG in the absence of salts, and it is
preferable to use the method described by Di
Ferrante and Rich (1956) in which these agents are
added to untreated urine. CPC is the best of the three
precipitants in the presence of urinary salts (Di
Ferrante, 1967) although glycoproteins tend to be
co-precipitated. The latter problem is easily over￾come as a higher concentration of precipitant
than recommended by Di Ferrante (1967) leaves
glycoproteins in solution (Goldberg and Cotlier,
1972; Pennock, 1973). Aminoacridine has not been
widely used because, in addition to being less efficient
than CPC, the method is more time consuming.
Column chromatography of either dialysed or
CPC precipitated samples has held an important
place in research into GAG excretion patterns but
is time consuming and results in a large number of
fractions for further analysis. However, the addition
of urine directly to an ECTEOLA cellulose column
and elution of GAG with a single solvent gives
the same results as CPC precipitation (Di Ferrante,
1967).
The amount of hexuronic acid containing material
present after dialysis varies with the duration of
dialysis, the number of changes of distilled water,
and pore size of the membrane, and considerable
losses of GAG may occur (Rosenfeld, 1971). This
applies particularly to samples from patients with
Hurler's syndrome in which up to 50 % of the GAG
may be dialysable compared with i1i% in samples
from normal subjects (Constantopoulos, 1968);
similar losses have been found in Scheie's syndrome
even when Visking dialysis tubing was heated to
reduce the pore size (Pennock, 1973).
However, despite losses, the hexuronic acid con￾tent of a dialysed sample is usually, but not always,
greater than that recovered by CPC precipitation of
untreated urine. The CPC precipitable hexuronic
acid was found by Rosenfeld (1971) to be 25-55 % of
non-dialysable hexuronic acid in normal adults and
70% in children, and a similar range of 11-65 % in
adults but a greater range of 71-156 % in children was
found by Pennock et al (1975), ie, in samples from

Simple laboratory methods used for the study ofglycosaminoglycan excretion
some normal children a large portion of CPC pre￾cipitable material will be lost on dialysis. This has
also been observed in some patients with mucopoly￾saccharidoses (see above). It is not known whether
the high results in some dialysed samples are due to
interfering chromogens, as suggested by Manley et
al (1968), or to the presence of GAG which is not
CPC precipitable, as suggested by Rosenfeld (1971).
Rosenfeld (1971) has shown the presence of at
least three GAG types and suggested the possibility
of a fourth. GAG may be: (1) high molecular weight,
non-dialysable but CPC precipitable; (2) low mole￾cular weight, ultrafilterable, and thus lost on
dialysis but CPC precipitable; (3) very low molecular
weight, ultrafilterable and lost on dialysis, and not
CPC precipitable; (4) low molecular weight and
attached to proteins which are neither dialysable nor
precipitable. Di Ferrante et al (1972) have confirmed
that low molecular weight GAG exist which are not
CPC precipitable and which will pass through a
Visking dialysis membrane even after reduction of
pore size with heat treatment. However, the actual
concentration of these low molecular weight GAG
in patients with mucopolysaccharidoses is the same
as in normal children so that the estimation of this
fraction is of little diagnostic value, although further
research into their nature could be enlightening. It is
important to emphasize that precipitation of GAG
with CPC from untreated urine gives the same re￾sults as isolation by ECTEOLA cellulose chromato￾graphy. The former is the simpler of the two methods
and is therefore described in the appendix. Because
the proportion of CPC precipitable GAG which is
lost on dialysis varies among normal individuals and
patients with mucopolysaccharidoses one must
reiterate the comment made by Di Ferrante (1967),
'One cannot be too emphatic in discouraging dialysis
of urine prior to precipitation'.
Once a suitable GAG preparation has been
isolated the estimation of hexuronic acid presents
little problem and it may be measured by the carba￾zole-sulphuric acid method (Dische, 1947) or the
borate modification of that method (Bitter and
Muir, 1962). The latter gives almost equal colour
yield for glucuronic and iduronic acid and may be
carried out as a single step reaction in the modified
manner described in the appendix.
Whiteman (1973a, b) has described a quantitative
test in which GAG are precipitated with alcian blue
and the dye is ultimately eluted from the precipitate
and measured colorimetrically. This test may offer
advantages over CPC precipitation in that the colour
yield for equal amounts of different GAG is almost
identical and keratan sulphate is precipitated. Re￾sults by this method tend to be slightly higher than
those obtained by measuring CPC precipitable
hexuronic acid, and this may be due to other un￾known reactants but there is a reasonable correlation
between the two methods (Whiteman, 1973b). Full
details of this test as an alternative to the CPC citrate
test are not included in the appendix since it has
been used in only a few laboratories and its true value
has not yet been fully assessed. The precipitate is
often very finely dispersed and often difficult to
harvest without centrifugation at least at 2000 RCF
for 15 minutes, facilities for which may not be
available in many small clinical laboratories. It may
prove to be of special value in the study of Morquio's
disease if it proves more reliable than CPC for the
isolation of keratan sulphate (vide infra).
Identification of Type of GAG excreted
The major GAG excreted by normal individuals is
chondroitin-6-sulphate (Di Ferrante, 1969) whereas
heparan sulphate, dermatan sulphate, and keratan
sulphate are excreted in excess in patients with
mucopolysaccharidoses (see interpretation of GAG
excretion pattern below and table IV).

'Pattern may be equal amounts of both GAG or, more often, difficult
to distinguish from type I (see text).
Identification of GAG excretion pattern requires
simple methods for separating and assessing the
relative proportions of heparan, dermatan, and
keratan sulphates. Most investigations have used
column chromatography but separations are often
imperfect (Kaplan, 1969). Full identification requires
hydrolysis of the appropriate fractions and structural
identification by defining the principal hexosamines
(see table II) by further column chromatography
which is not only time-consuming but often affords
inadequate separation. These methods are quite
unsuited to the small hospital laboratory.
Electrophoretic separation may be done in barbi￾tone buffer (Manley and Hawksworth, 1966). Al￾though this method does not separate dermatan

sulphate (DS) from the chondroitin sulphates (CS)
nor heparan sulphate (HS) from keratan sulphate, it
is a useful method since galactosamine containing
GAG and glucosamine containing GAG migrate as
two separate bands. Other separations have been
described which are based on GAG structure and
include electrophoresis in barium acetate (Wessler,
1968) in which keratan sulphate separates poorly
from chondroitin sulphates, and electrophoresis in
cupric acetate (Hata and Nagai, 1972) and zinc
sulphate (Hardingham and Phelps, 1970), both of
which fail to separate heparan and keratan sulphates,
and the poorly defined separations of other GAG
are more difficult to interpret than those achieved in
barbitone or barium acetate (Pennock, 1973).
Barium acetate gives good separation of DS and HS
(Lewis et al, 1974), and this method has been selected
and described in the appendix because of its speed
and simplicity.
Thin layer chromatography of GAG has been
used by Wusteman et al (1966) who found difficulty
in separating dermatan sulphate, and by Teller and
Ziemann (1969) who were unable to separate keratan
sulphate from other GAG. The best method de￾scribed so far is that based on the relative solubility
of different GAG, as their calcium salts, in alcohol
using a sequence of solvents which affords a very
rapid and efficient separation of all GAG (Lippiello
and Mankin, 1971; Humbel and Chamoles, 1972).
The method is included in the appendix with com￾ments on intepretation of patterns of GAG excre￾tion. This is the only method which clearly separates
keratan sulphate from other GAG and is thus in￾valuable in the diagnosis of Morquio's disease.
In summary, the simple tests required include:
1. A reliable screening test for which the CPC
citrate test is recommended.
2. Isolation of GAG and estimation as hexuronic
acid.
3. Isolation of GAG and identification of excre￾tion pattern by thin layer chromatography and/or
electrophoresis.
In most urines, these methods enable a diagnosis
to be made but rarely equivocal results may be
obtained, and in these cases a more elaborate pro￾cedure is necessary such as measuring the proportion
of hyaluronidase resistant GAG (Pennock et al,
1973), estimation and identification of hexosamine
content by gas liquid chromatography (Murphy et al,
1974), specific estimation of dermatan sulphate
(Di Ferrante et al, 1971), estimation of amino
sulphate as a measure of heparan sulphate
(Lagunoff et al, 1967) or measurement of keratan
sulphate as galactose (Robertson and Harvey, 1972).
All of these methods are rarely required and are not
included in the appendix.

Interpretation of Results and Diagnostic Difficulties
False positive CPC citrate screening tests may be
found in some patients on certain drugs such as
barbiturates, phenytoin, and penicillins but the
mechanism is not understood (Pennock et al, 1970).
Patients with renal disease and mucoproteinuria will
also give false positive results, since mucoproteins
precipitate with CPC, but CPC precipitable hexu￾ronic acid is usually within normal limits.
Any patient with excessive connective tissue
destruction may give a positive CPC citrate screening
test and an increased excretion of CPC precipitable
hexuronic acid. Notable examples include rickets
(Valdivieso et al, 1973), malabsorption syndromes
with gross osteomalacia, malignant disorders with
extensive secondary deposits (including leukaemia),
and patients with disseminated lupus erythematosus
(Di Ferrante et al, 1957); some patients with rheuma￾toid arthritis (Di Ferrante, 1957; Thompson and
Castor, 1966) and some with Marfan's syndrome
(Berenson and Dalferes, 1965; Bitter et al, 1970) as
well as a few other rare disorders (Brimacombe and
Stacey, 1964). Qualitative examination of excreted
GAG shows that chondroitin sulphates predominate
and hence the excretion pattern is similar to normal
excretion and easily differentiated from the pattern
in the mucopolysaccharidoses.
Patients with one of the mucopolysaccharidoses
excrete excessive amounts of heparan, dermatan or
keratan sulphates, and the excretion patterns are
shown in table IV. The excretion pattern in Hurler's,
Scheie's, and Maroteaux-Lamy syndromes is con￾sistent and easy to interpret. In a detailed study of
excretion patterns, Kaplan (1969) found roughly
equal amounts of heparan sulphate in patients with
Hunter's syndrome. Others have failed to confirm
this, finding that the pattern in Hunter's syndrome
more frequently resembles the pattern in Hurler's
syndrome (Maroteaux, 1970; Pennock, 1973). There￾fore, these two conditions cannot always be dis￾tinguished by the simple methods described. This
does not detract from the value of the simple
methods since distinction is also difficult to
make using more sophisticated techniques, and
furthermore the problem is not usually great since
distinction between the two syndromes may be made
on clinical grounds. Similar comments apply to
Scheie's syndrome (MPS Type IS) where the enzyme
defect and excretion pattern are identical with those
of Hurler's syndrome (Wiesmann and Neufeld, 1970)
but the clinical features are distinctly different
(McKusick, 1972)

Simple laboratory methods used for the study ofglycosaminoglycan excretion
be distinguished by electrophoresis (Lewis et al,
1974). However, by thin layer chromatography one
type shows a heparan sulphate fraction which
migrates in the same position as heparan sulphate
from normal urine while the other type shows a
heparan sulphate fraction which behaves as if it
were chondroitin-4-sulphate. However, the pattern
is still distinct from normal and gives no problem in
interpretation if electrophoresis in barium acetate is
also done when any doubt exists.
The diagnosis of Morquio's disease, although it is
clearly a mucopolysaccharidosis with abnormal
keratan sulphate metabolism (Robins et al, 1963),
should be regarded as a separate problem. This is
mainly because keratan sulphate excretion may
sometimes be normal, especially in adult life
(Maroteaux and Lamy, 1967; Linker et al, 1970;
Jenkins et al, 1973). When keratan sulphate excre￾tion is increased the CPC citrate screening test is
usually positive and usually there is also an increase
in CPC precipitable hexuronic acid since there is a
parallel increase in chondroitin sulphate excretion
(Pennock, 1973). Although it has been disputed
that keratan sulphate is precipitated by CPC, it is
now clear that although precipitation is difficult
from aqueous solutions it is readily achieved in urine
(Di Ferrante, 1967). Indeed the first demonstration
of increased keratan sulphate excretion in Morquio's
disease by Pedrini et al (1962) was achieved using
quatemary ammonium precipitants. Furthermore, it
seems likely that most of the keratan sulphate is
actually excreted as a complex with chondroitin
sulphate similar to the form in which it exists in
cartilage although probably of reduced molecular
size. Since it is only soluble in excess CPC when it is
totally released from its hybrid chondroitin sulphate
complex (Goldberg, 1973; Kaplan et al, 1968), most
urinary keratan sulphate would precipitate with the
chondroitin sulphate fraction. Recently the excre￾tion of keratan sulphate throughout childhood has
been studied by Robertson and Harvey (1972),
using ion-exchange chromatography followed by
GAG precipitation and estimation of keratan sul￾phate as galactose. This is a potentially useful
method for the study of Morquio's disease and other
spondyloepiphyseal dysplasias. This disease clearly
requires further study, and its separation from the
other mucopolysaccharidoses in this sense appears
justified.
One final problem is worthy of mention. It is often
difficult to distinguish high abnormal GAG excre￾tion from normal results in the neonatal period since
GAG excretion in relation to creatinine is high at
this time of life even in normal individuals (Pennock
et al, 1971). A request for examination of urinary
GAG in the first year of life should, therefore, be
2
completed by qualitative examinationof the excretion
pattern since the latter is usually abnormal from
birth in the mucopolysaccharidoses even when total
GAG excretion as hexuronic acid is within normal
limits, and well before radiological changes are
demonstrable (Pennock, 1973).
In conclusion, the methods outlined in the
appendix are adequate for the diagnosis of the
various mucopolysaccharidoses provided note is
taken of the difficulties which may be encountered
and which have been discussed in the preceding para￾graphs. The methods are simple and require the
minimum of apparatus and technical skill and
should, therefore, be easily performed in any hospital
or laboratory. They will remain of value in the in￾vestigation of the mucopolysaccharidoses until such
time as suitable enzyme substrates are made available
commercially. More specialized or new methods are
required for the study of keratan sulphate excretion
and the identification of patients with Morquio's
disease.
I am indebted to Dr G. Walters for helpful advice
during the preparation of this review.
APPENDIX
Details of methods suitable for a simple study of
excess glycosaminoglycan (GAG) excretion for the
diagnosis of mucopolysaccharidoses
A. COLLECTION AND PREPARATION OF
THE SAMPLE
Early morning specimens should not be used for
screening tests, and infected samples collected at any
time are unsuitable for analysis. Either single speci￾mens passed between 0900 and 1800 hours or com￾plete 24-hour specimens should be collected without
preservative and stored frozen until analysed.
(Freezing is not absolutely essential provided the
sample does not become secondarily infected.)
The specific gravity of the sample should be
measured and adjusted to less than 1 020 with dis￾tilled water if necessary. The sample should be
centrifuged and the supernatant used for the estima￾tion of creatinine and for the following tests.
B. SCREENING TEST
(CPC-citrate turbidity: Pennock, 1969)
Principle
Under controlled conditions of pH and electrolyte
concentration cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) reacts
with GAGs to form an insoluble precipitate. In the
presence of a citrate buffer at pH 4-8 this precipitate

is sufficiently stabilized and dispersed to measure
the absorbance at 680 nm in a spectrophotometer of
filter colorimeter or its turbidity may be measured
using a nephelometer.
Reagents
1. Citrate buffer pH 4 8 (0-1 M). Dissolve 9-68 g of
citric acid (AR) and 15 88 g of trisodium citrate
(AR) in 1 litre of deionized water. Adjust the pH to
4-8 using a pH meter (little adjustment is usually
required as this pH is close to the pK2 of citric
acid).
2. CPC reagent. Dissolve 1 g of cetylpyridinium
chloride in 1 litre of the above buffer. Store at room
temperature-shelf life at least one year.
3. Standards. Prepare standard aqueous solutions of
chondroitin sulphate (CS) (Calbiochem Ltd) to
contain 50 and 100 mg per litre. Store at 40C.
Method
1. Centrifuge the sample and use the supernatant for
the test. Allow standards and samples to reach room
temperature (20-25°) before testing. (This is ex￾tremely important as CPC comes out of solution at
low temperature and will do so if added to a
cold sample, thus giving a falsely high turbidity.)
2. Mix 1 ml of sample with 1 ml of citrate buffer
as a blank.
3. Mix 1 ml of sample with 1 ml of CPC reagent for
the test.
4. Mix 1 ml of standard with 1 ml of CPC reagent.
5. Allow to stand at room temperature for at least
30 minutes, remix, and read absorbance of blanks,
tests, and standards at 680 nm. (Lower wave
lengths, but not less than 450 nm, or filter instru￾ments may be used.) Absorbance (OD) is linear up to
a concentration of 100 mg/l.

One CPC unit is equivalent to the absorbance given
by a solution containing 10 mg CS per litre. The

results are finally expressed as CPC units per gram
of creatinine or per mole of creatinine. The normal
range at different ages throughout childhood is
given in table I. The uppper limit in the first year of
life is an arbitrary one chosen to ensure detection
of abnormal samples but which gives a slightly

C. QUANTITATIVE ESTIMATION OF GAG BY
MEASUREMENT OF HEXURONIC ACID
CONTENT
Principle
All the glycosaminoglycans, except keratan sulphate,
contain hexuronic acids as part of the molecule.
This will react with carbazole in the presence of
concentrated sulphuric acid to give a magenta
coloured product. The GAGs must first be isolated
from other hexuronic acid-containing metabolites,
and this is simply achieved by using CPC as pre￾cipitant.
Reagents
The following reagents are used for isolation of GAG
(Di Ferrante, 1967) and estimation of hexuronic
acid (Bitter and Muir, 1962).
1. CPC reagent. Dissolve 100 g of cetylpyridinium
chloride in 1 litre of deionized water. Store at room
temperature. The CPC is only poorly soluble and
solution can be achieved by gentle agitationinawarm
water bath at approximately 40°C. Excessive heating
should not be used since the CPC will be degraded.
2. Potassium acetate in ethanol. Dissolve 10 g of
potassium acetate in 1 litre of absolute ethanol.
3. Borate-sulphuric acid reagent. Dissolve 9-5 g of
sodium tetraborate decahydrate (AR) in 1 litre
concentrated sulphuric acid (AR). Store at 4°C￾shelf life in excess of one year.
4. Carbazole reagent. Dissolve 1 25 g carbazole in Protected by copyright, including for uses related to text and data mining, AI training, and similar technologies. .

Simple laboratory methods used for the study ofglycosaminoglycan excretion
1 litre of 95 % ethanol (AR). (In practice it is best to
prepare a smaller volume and store in a dark bottle
as the shelf life does not exceed three months.)
5. Hexuronic acid standards. Dissolve glucurono￾lactone (previously dried in a vacuum desiccator
over phosphorus pentoxide for three days) in a
solution containing 30 g of benzoic acid per litre, to
give final concentrations of 100, 80, 60, 40, 20 mg/l
or prepare a stock solution containing 1-7613 g/l
(10 mM) and dilute to give standards containing 500,
400, 300, 200, 100 pLM/litre of benzoic acid solution.
Method
(a) Isolation of GAGs
1. Place 5 ml of filtered sample prepared as described
in section A in a 15 x 90 mm disposable poly￾styrene tube (Metal Box Co Ltd) and add 0-2 ml of
CPC reagent. Mix well and stand overnight at 4°C.
2. Centrifuge for 15 minutes in a standard bench
centrifuge at 3 000 rev/min. Carefully remove super￾natant with a Pasteur pipette and discard.
3. Add 5 ml of potassium acetate in ethanol to the
precipitate, mix well, and stand overnight at 4°C.
Centrifuge again at 3000 rev/min for 15 minutes,
discard supernatant, and invert the tube on filter
paper to drain. (The precipitate should be sufficiently
well packed not to become dislodged.)
4. Add 1 ml of deionized water and mix well to
dissolve the precipitate. (If the screening test result
was very high add 5 ml of water.) If the precipitate
does not dissolve immediately, leave at room tem￾perature for 1 hour with frequent mixing. Centrifuge,
if necessary, to remove insoluble material and use
supernatant for hexuronic acid assay.
(b) Hexuronic Acid Assay
1. Place 0O2 ml of the final sample in a 15 x 125 mm
Pyrex tube.
2. Add 0 2 ml of carbazole reagent.
3. Add 2-0 ml of cold borate-sulphuric acid reagent.
4. Stopper the tubes. Mix well (at least 15 seconds on
a vortex mixer). The mixing is extremely important.
If narrower bore tubes are used, adequate mixing is
difficult owing to the viscosity of the sulphuric acid.
5. Set up water (blank) and standards in the same
way.
6. Transfer to a vigourously boiling water bath for
7 minutes (the time is not critical between 7 and 10
minutes). Deionized water should be used in the
water bath since chlorine in tap water may affect
the reaction and give a green product.
7. Remove from water bath, cool to room tempera￾ture, and read the absorbance in a 1 cm light path
cuvette at 530 nm. (The colour is stable for several
hours if stored in the dark.)
8. Calculate the concentration per litre from the

original urine concentration if 1 ml of water was
added at step 4 of the isolation procedure and is
equal to the original urine concentration if 5 ml was
added. Results are expressed in relation to the crea￾tinine content of the urine sample, and the normal
range is given in table II.
D. IDENTIFICATION OF GAG EXCRETION
PATTERN
1. Isolation of GAG
Isolation of GAG is achieved by the method de￾scribed in section C using 100 ml of urine (SG ad￾justed to less than 1020) and increasing the CPC
reagent volume to 4 ml. The larger volumes in￾volved may present difficulties in centrifugation if
only a standard bench centrifuge is available. In
the author's laboratory the precipitation is usually
done in 25 ml aliquots of urine, adding 1 ml of CPC
reagent, in universal glass specimen collection con￾tainers. After CPC precipitation overnight at 4°C the
harvested precipitate is mixed with 2-3 ml of
potassium acetate in ethanol, and the precipitates
are pooled from all bottles and transferred to a single
bottle. A further aliquot of alcohol reagent is added
to wash final traces from each bottle, and the
washings are added to the final bottle. The final
volume is made up to approximately 25 ml with more
alcohol reagent and left overnight at 4°C. The pre￾cipitate is harvested by centrifugation and washed
once with a few millilitres of diethyl ether, dried, and
taken up in deionized water. Sufficient water should
be added to give a final GAG concentration in the
region of 2-5-5 mM per litre in terms of hexuronic
acid. This volume is calculated from the known
concentration of CPC precipitable hexuronic acid

in the original urine. The final solution is centri￾fuged and the supernatant is used for electrophoresis
and chromatography.
2. Electrophoresis (based on Wessler (1968))
Electrophoresis is done on any type of cellulose
acetate membrane. (In the author's laboratory 5 x
18 cm strips of Oxoid cellulose acetate are used.
Other workers prefer Sepraphore III which gives
slightly better separation. The running times given
below apply to Oxoid cellulose acetate and may need
to be shortened for other types of cellulose mem￾brane.) The membrane is soaked in the electrolyte
solution for at least 20 minutes before use. It should
be floated on the surface to allow electrolyte solu￾tion to soak up through the membrane before full
submersion, since immediate submersion will result
in uneven wetting of membrane and ultimate poor
separations. The membrane is then blotted between
Whatman No. 1 filter paper to remove excess elec￾trolyte and then placed across a Shandon electro￾phoresis tank with a 10 cm bridge gap. Conducting
wicks are made of Whatman No. 1 filter paper.
Current should be applied to the membrane for
about 10 minutes, before application and separation
of the sample, in order to obtain an even distribution
of electrolyte and water through the membrane.
The sample is applied with a 20 H1d pipette, using a
ruler as a guiding edge, and approximately 10 yul
is applied as an even streak approximately 2 cm in
length and 3 cm from the anode. A marker solution
containing 2 mg of chondroitin sulphate and 2 mg
of heparin per ml should be applied to a separate
strip.
Electrophoresis is done in 01 M barium acetate
at 2 mA/cm constant current for three hours. The
strips are stained as described below.
Staining of Separated GAG
Electrophoretic strips are stained for 30 minutes in
1 00 alcian blue in 2500 acetic acid. The strips are
floated onto the stain to allow complete uptake of
dye before full submersion. The strips are then
washed in running tap water until a clear white
background is achieved. They may be inspected
visually or dried between Whatman No. 1 filter
paper overnight, cleared in Whitmor transparency
oil (Shandon Southern Ltd) and scanning using a
scanning densitometer.
Electrophoresis in barium acetate gives separation
with the following order of decreasing mobility￾CS, KS, DS, HS, Hep. KS separates poorly from CS,
HS separates poorly from DS, and HA migrates
with DS. Some samples of heparin contain an HS
fraction but neither Hep nor HA are prominent
fractions in normal urine. This electrophoretic
method is not perfect but, taken in conjunction with
thin layer chromatography, sufficient data are
obtained for reliable interpretation.
3. Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) (Humbel and
Chamoles, 1972)
This method is based on the differences in solubility
of the calcium salts of GAG in different concentra￾tions of alcohol. The thin layer plate is chromato￾graphed through six separate solutions of decreas￾ing alcohol concentration. Cellulose plates 01 mm
thick, 20 x 20 cm (Polygram CEL 300 Camblab,
Cambridge), are marked with a soft pencil at 2 cm
distances from the bottom of the plate. Approxi￾mately 10 ,il of GAG solution is applied on the
first line in a thin streak, 1-2 cm in width, and dried.
The plate is then placed in the first solvent and this is
allowed to ascend to the second line. The plate is
then removed, excess solvent being quickly re￾moved by touching the bottom of the plate on
Whatman No. 1 filter paper, and transferred to the
second tank containing solvent 2, which is then
allowed to ascend to the third line. This sequence is
repeated until all six solvents have been used. If
insufficient tanks are available, two may be used, and
the tank not in use at any one time can be cleaned
out and the next solvent added. Fifty millilitres of
solvent is adequate for each tank and the solvent
concentrations are as follows:
1. 25 g calcium acetate per litre of
70o% v/v ethanol in 0 5 M acetic acid
2. 50 g calcium acetate per litre of
5000 v/v ethanol in 0-5 M acetic acid
3. 50 g calcium acetate per litre of
400% v/v ethanol in 0 5 M acetic acid
4. 50 g calcium acetate per litre of
30 % v/v ethanol in 0-5 M acetic acid
5. 50 g calcium acetate per litre of
20% v/v ethanol in 0 5 M acetic acid
6. 50 g calcium acetate per litre of
100% v/v ethanol in 0 5 M acetic acid
The first solution has a slightly higher concentra￾tion of alcohol than that used by Humbel and
Chamoles (1972) and affords a better separation of
KS. The solvents must be prepared fresh for each
separation.
After the chromatography is complete the plate is
dried and stained for 10 minutes in 1 % alcian blue
8GX in 7000 ethanol-acetic acid mixture (95/5/v/v).
The plate is washed with 10% acetic acid to remove
as much excess dye as possible.
If the individual solvent fronts are numbered 1 to 6
from the origin, the migration position of different
GAG in relation to these fronts is as follows:
DS(1-2), HS(2-3), C4S(4), C6S(4-5), and KS(5-6).
Interpretation is easier than with electrophoresis.

Simple laboratory methods used for the study of glycosaminoglycan excretion
Normal urines contain predominantly chondroitin￾6-sulphate with trace amounts of other GAG. DS
and HS are well separated from each other and from
other GAGs, and their relative proportions may be
used to establish a diagnosis in line with the results
shown in table IV of the main text. The method is
excellent for detection of KS in patients with
Morquio's disease. HS in some patients with
Sanfilippo syndrome migrates a little further than
HS in patients with Hurler's syndrome. This is
clearly the best simple method for qualitative GAG
identification described up to the present time.
