Abstract Activation of endogenous cardiac stem/progenitor
cells (eCSCs) can improve cardiac repair after acute myocardial
infarction. We studied whether the in situ activation of eCSCs by
insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and hepatocyte growth
factor (HGF) could be increased using a newly developed
hydrogel in chronic myocardial infarction (MI). One-month
post-MI pigs underwent NOGA-guided intramyocardial injec￾tions of IGF-1/HGF (GF: both 0.5 μg/mL, n =5) or IGF-1/HGF
incorporated in UPy hydrogel (UPy-GF; both 0.5 μg/mL, n =5).
UPy hydrogel without added growth factors was administered to
four control (CTRL) pigs. Left ventricular ejection fraction was
increased in the UPy-GF and GF animals compared to CTRLs.
UPy-GF delivery reduced pathological hypertrophy, led to the
formation of new, small cardiomyocytes, and increased
capillarization. The eCSC population was increased almost four￾fold in the border zone of the UPy-GF-treated hearts compared
to CTRL hearts. These results show that IGF-1/HGF therapy led
to an improved cardiac function in chronic MI and that effect
size could be further increased by using UPy hydrogel.

Introduction
Despite early revascularization, acute myocardial infarction
leads to irreversible loss of cardiomyocytes. As a conse￾quence, the increased workload on the surviving
cardiomyocytes often initiates a cascade of additional cardio￾myocyte loss, myocardial remodeling, until the vicious circle
ends in chronic heart failure (CHF) [1]. In the USA alone,
approximately 5.7 million patients have CHF accounting for
roughly US $30 billion annually in health care costs in 2008,
which are predicted to triplicate by 2030 [2]. Given the initial
loss of functional cardiomyocytes as the trigger of adverse
remodeling processes that eventually lead to CHF [1], it is
imperative to develop new low-cost, widely available treat￾ments that are able to ameliorate the natural disease progres￾sion following a myocardial infarction (MI) to reduce the
occurrence of post-MI heart failure.
One of the emerging therapeutic approaches relies on
the notion that the adult mammalian heart fosters an
innate capacity for cardiomyocyte regeneration, and dif￾ferent approaches to upscale this phenomenon to a clinically
relevant level of myocardial regeneration are under intense
investigation [3, 4].
The presence of tissue-specific, endogenous cardiac stem/
progenitor cells (eCSCs) that reside in the heart and, upon
activation, can create progeny that mature into functional
cardiomyocytes and vasculature has been put forward as the
causal agent for the regenerative capacity of the heart [5–7].
Recently, accumulating evidence supported the notion that the
regenerative response of eCSCs toward the ischemic myocar￾dium can be stimulated by means of in situ administration of
various growth factors, such as insulin-like growth factor 1
(IGF-1) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) [8–10]. We
have previously shown that the co-administration of IGF-1
and HGF led to the activation of eCSCs, increased
cardiomyogenesis, and significantly improved cardiac func￾tion [9]. Yet, like previous studies, these results were
reported on animal models addressing the acute phase of
the MI, which, by itself, is a complex and powerful
initiator of numerous molecular signaling processes in
response to the ischemic insult [11]. Given the unmet
clinical need for the development of new therapeutics to
treat post-MI heart failure, we investigated whether the
effect of IGF-1/HGF therapy is also effective in the
post-MI heart, in which cardiac adverse remodeling is
already an active process. To this end, we used the pig
model of chronic MI as the pig heart closely resembles
the human size and hemodynamics.
Besides the validation and identification of growth factors
and signaling pathways that can stimulate cardiac repair, novel
drug delivery systems such as biomaterials are extensively
being studied to increase effect size. Previous reports showed
that by combining growth factors with an injectable biomaterial,
the biomaterial could serve as a controlled drug release plat￾form, thereby improving functional outcome [10, 12]. There￾fore, we investigated the added value of incorporating the
growth factors within a smart hydrogel that can serve as a
release scaffold upon catheter-based delivery in the infarcted
heart to generate sustained GF levels at the site of dysfunction
over time. Recently, we have reported on a new pH-switchable
and self-healing hydrogel carrier that could be injected in the
heart by transendocardial delivery using the NOGA™ cath￾eter system (Biosense Webster, Johnson & Johnson Co.). We
have previously shown that the release kinetics in vitro
showed a 4-day time span for both IGF-1 and HGF in the
absence of protein degradation based on the increased pH of
the hydrogel [13]. Furthermore, IGF-1/HGF-loaded hydrogel
injections in the border zone of the infarct created an effec￾tive spatial gradient of growth factors within the heart in
which growth factor concentrations increased toward the site
of injection [13].
Here, we present the first results on the efficacy of this
new hydrogel system in combination with growth factors
IGF-1/HGF on cardiac function and the progression of
post-MI adverse remodeling in the pig chronic MI model.
Methods
A detailed method section can be found in the Electronic
supplementary material (ESM). Briefly, MI was induced by
75-min intracoronary balloon occlusion of the left circumflex
(LCx) followed by reperfusion in 6-month-old female Dalland
landrace pigs (∼70 kg). Four weeks later, ten intramyocardial
injections of 0.2 mL each were placed in the infarct border zone
with either IGF-1/HGF in 0.9 % saline (GF: both 0.5 μg/mL),
IGF-1/HGF in UPy hydrogel (UPy-GF; both 0.5 μg/mL), or
UPy hydrogel alone as a control (CTRL). Four weeks after
treatment, cardiac function was assessed with 2D and 3D
echocardiography and pressure volume loop analysis. Regional
microvascular resistance was quantified by simultaneous
assessment of the intracoronary pressure/and flow velocity
parameters. Cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, cell proliferation,
new cardiomyocyte and capillary formation, c-kitpos CD45neg
eCSC number, and their committed progeny were characterized
by immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy.
Results
Mortality and Procedural Data
A schematic of the study design is depicted in Fig. 1a. Three
animals died during the induction of ischemia by LCx occlu￾sion as a consequence of refractory ventricular fibrillation.
One animal died 4 weeks later, prior to the intervention. Of

the surviving 14 animals, five animals were randomly allocated
to UPy-GF, five animals to GF, and the remaining four animals
to UPy hydrogel alone, serving as controls.
IGF-1/HGF Administration Improves Cardiac Function
in Chronic MI
First, the controls, UPy hydrogel without growth factors, were
compared against a historical cohort of identical MI procedure
and NOGA injections with phosphate-buffered saline 1 month
after MI. There were no differences in any echocardiographic
or PV loop-derived parameters (ESM Fig. 1). Thus, with
no indication that the UPy hydrogel by itself influenced
post-MI remodeling, we considered the empty UPy hydro￾gel as negative controls. As a reference value, prior to MI,
the left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) was on
average 81.2±6 mL. Two months after MI, there was a
slight increase in LVEDV by ∼15 % in all groups, but it
did not differ between treatment groups (CTRL vs. GF vs.
UPy-GF, 94.9±10.8 vs. 94.0±8.9 vs. 92.4±6.6 mL, respec￾tively, p =0.915; Fig. 2a). On the other hand, the mean
change relative to baseline in LV end-systolic volumes
(ESV) was significantly improved in the UPy-GF group
compared to GF-treated animals and controls (−1.1±2.3 vs.
−10.3±9.9 vs. −9.5±4.6 mL, p =0.03; Fig. 2b). Likewise,
progressive deterioration in left ventricular ejection fraction
was also significantly reversed in the UPy-GF group (mean
change, +2.8±2.7 %; Fig. 2c) compared to CTRL animals
(−5.9±3.8 %, p =0.02; Fig. 2d), but did not significantly
differ from the GF group (0.8±2.0 %, p =0.410; Fig. 2c).
Fractional area shortening (ESM Fig. 2) was significantly
improved in both the GF and UPy-GF groups compared to the
CTRL animals (+2.3±1.8 vs. +4.2±2.0 vs. −2.6±3.6 %,
p =0.008; Fig. 2d). With regard to diastolic function of
the heart, the ratio of transmitral flow velocity to annu￾lar peak diastolic velocity (E/E′) was preserved in the
IGF-1/HGF-treated animals (GF, 7.7±0.3; UPy-GF, 7.4±1.1)
compared to CTRLs (9.3±0.6, p =0.04).
Targeted Intramyocardial IGF-1/HGF Delivery Attenuates
Cardiomyocyte Hypertrophy and Fibrosis in Chronic MI
Histological analyses have been summarized in Table 1.
As a reference, average cardiomyocyte diameter in the
healthy pig heart was 18±3 μm. Four weeks after the
NOGA-guided injections, histological analysis revealed
significant cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in the border zone
of the CTRL hearts (Fig. 3a and Table 1). In contrast,
both GF and UPy-GF treatments attenuated cardiomyocyte
hypertrophy as well as increased the number of relatively
small (<18 μm) cardiomyocytes compared to CTRL
(18.47±2.56 vs. 16.04±1.85 vs. 21.20±2.81 μm for GF,
UPy-GF, and CTRL, respectively, p =0.04; Fig. 3b, i). In
line with previous pilot data [13], both the GF- and the
UPy-GF-treated hearts showed a trend toward reduction in
fibrosis, shown by picric Sirius red staining (Fig. 3c–h and
Table 1), compared to the CTRL group (p =0.27).
Intramyocardial IGF-1/HGF Administration Leads
to the Formation of New Cardiomyocytes
Immunohistological analyses have been summarized in
Table 1. Different myocardial cell types express growth
factor receptors for IGF-1 and/or HGF. Thus, we sought to
investigate the level of cell proliferation in the border zone
of the chronic MI after GF treatment. Even 30 days after
the injection procedure, an increased proliferation rate
assessed by Ki67 expression was present within the GF￾treated hearts, which was greater in the UPy-GF-treated
hearts (Fig. 4a, b and Table 1). In particular, the border
zone of the GF- and UPy-GF-treated animals harbored
newly formed, small, immature Ki67pos cardiomyocytes,

which amounted to ∼1 every 1,000 cardiomyocytes
(Fig. 4c). These small Ki67pos cardiomyocytes accounted
for >10 % of the total proliferating Ki67pos cells in the
GF-treated hearts, making their existence physiologically
significant. Although Ki67pos cardiomyocytes were also
observed in the CTRL hearts, these were only witnessed
in ∼1 every 3,000 cardiomyocytes (p =0.016). To verify
that these Ki67pos cardiomyocytes were newly formed, we
measured their size and compared this with Ki67neg
cardiomyocytes. Indeed, the Ki67pos cardiomyocytes were
on average smaller (12.52±3.97 μm; Fig. 4e) compared to
their Ki67neg counterparts (17.48±3.85, p =0.0006; Fig. 4e),
suggestive of a newly formed and immature cardiomyocyte
subpopulation [6, 9].
IGF-1/HGF Delivery Leads to the Formation of New
Capillaries in the Infarct Borderzone
The IGF-1/HGF treatment led to an increased number of
capillaries in the infarct border zone, favoring the UPy-GF
group (8.6±0.9/0.2 vs. 7.8±0.9/0.2 vs. 6.3±0.8/0.2 mm2 for
UPy-GF, GF, and CTRL, respectively, p =0.022; Fig. 5a, b
and Table 1). Consistent with the increased capillarization,
the hyperemic microvascular resistance index (HMR; a
simultaneously measured intracoronary pressure and flow
velocity-derived parameter) was decreased in the infarct￾related artery in the UPy-GF group compared to the HMR
value measured just prior to the intramyocardial treatment
delivery (p =0.053; Fig. 5c).

IGF-1/HGF Administration Leads to Expansionary Growth
of the epCSC Compartment and Induces Cardiogenic
Precursors
To elucidate potential mechanisms governed by IGF-1/HGF
stimulation that are responsible for the observed new cardio￾myocyte and capillary formation, we determined the number
and precursor state of the previously described c-kitpos
CD45neg epCSCs [9]. We found increased c-kitpos cells in
the infarct and border zone with GF treatment; however,
∼73 % of all c-kitpos cells also co-expressed CD45, identifying
cardiac mast cells (iii in Fig. 6a and ESM Fig. 3) [9]. Further￾more, there was an infiltration of CD45pos c-kitneg cells into
the infarct and border zone (ii in Fig. 6a). c-kitpos CD45neg
epCSCs (i in Fig. 6a, b) had a relatively small cytoplasm￾to-nuclei ratio, and in the infarct zone, the total number of
epCSCs was increased fourfold by IGF-1/HGF delivery
compared to CTRL hearts (0.37±0.09 vs. 0.43±0.14 vs.
0.12±0.07 %, respectively, p =0.004; Fig. 6c and Table 1).
With regard to the border zone, the highest increase in c￾kitpos epCSC number was observed in the UPy-GF group
(0.24±0.06 %; Fig. 6c and Table 1) compared to GF or CTRL
hearts (0.14±0.06 vs. 0.12±0.01 %, p =0.03; Fig. 6c). Of
those epCSCs, sustained IGF-1/HGF release induced a modest
increase in the number of progenitor epCSCs (∼40 %) that co￾expressed the early cardiac transcription factor Nkx2.5, indic￾ative of their commitment toward the cardiomyogenic lineage
(Fig. 6d, e and Table 1). Furthermore, another subset of
epCSCs expressed the transcription factor Ets-1, indicative
of their commitment to the endothelial lineage and the gener￾ation of capillaries (Fig. 6f and Table 1) [9].
Discussion
In the present study, we sought to investigate the functional and
histological/cellular effects of the intramyocardial administra￾tion of IGF-1/HGF in chronic MI in the pig. We show that
improved delivery of IGF-1/HGF by a newly developed UPy
hydrogel carrier holds potential as a novel treatment for chronic
MI. Four weeks after delivery, UPy-IGF-1/HGF treatment led
to a reduction in pathological cardiac remodeling, activated
and increased the number of epCSCs, and led to the formation
of new cardiomyocytes and capillaries. Importantly, the repair
and regeneration of the damaged myocardial tissue was asso￾ciated with a significant improvement in cardiac function.

Heart Regeneration and eCSCs
To date, the presence of endogenous mechanisms for cardio￾myocyte renewal in the postnatal heart remains a subject of
intense debate [14]. Our findings presented here challenge the
prevalent view that the adult mammalian heart, at best, can
only increase its myocyte volume by means of a hypertrophic
response of existing cardiac myocytes in the absence of new
myocyte formation. Here, we show that the adult infarcted pig
heart contains immature cardiac myocytes that are substan￾tially smaller than normal, non-hypertrophied myocytes and
do not reside in the quiescent G0 phase of the cell cycle, as
would be expected given the hypothesis that the heart is a
post-mitotic organ. Importantly, this regenerative potential of
the adult heart could be effectively boosted by sustained
release of the growth factors IGF-1 and HGF. These findings
further ascertain the definitive presence of cardiomyocyte
renewal in the adult mammalian heart as deducted from elab￾orate pulse-chase experiments published by various indepen￾dent research groups [3, 7, 15–17].
Secondly, our present findings document that following
IGF-1/HGF administration, the number of resident c-kitpos
epCSCs in the peri-infarcted area increased (Fig. 6) analo￾gously to the increase in the presence of newly formed imma￾ture Ki67pos cardiomyocytes (Fig. 4). Indeed, the majority of
eCSCs in the peri-infarct region also co-expressed the nuclear
transcription factors Nkx2.5 and Ets-1, indicative of their
commitment toward the myogenic and vasculature lineage,

respectively. However, as to what extent these newly formed
cardiomyocytes reflect the differentiated progeny of eCSCs
[7, 15] or whether they are the result of an endogenous
regeneration mechanism that was indirectly mediated by para￾crine actions [18, 19] could not be answered in this transla￾tional large animal model.
Growth Factors to Stimulate Endogenous Cardiac Repair
Recently, essential growth factor/signaling pathways for
cardiomyogenesis during the embryonic period have been sum￾marized [20]. Various growth factors have been identified as
potential candidates to guide postnatal stem progenitor cells
toward a cardiomyogenic fate [8, 9, 21–23]. In a recent report
by Chimenti and co-workers [19], the possibility was raised that
eCSCs are not just mere consumers of growth factors but
actively secrete a wide range of growth factors themselves,
providing intricate networks of autocrine and paracrine feed￾back loops. We have previously documented that the effects of
a single administration of IGF-1/HGF is still measurable
2 months after its application, suggesting the existence of a
feedback loop triggered by the external stimuli that activates the
production of growth and survival factors by the targeted cells,
which explains the persistence and long duration of the regen￾erative myocardial response [9]. Since here we have observed
effects on cell proliferation detectable 1 month after the delivery
of a single dose of IGF-1/HGF, we speculate a similar
autocrine/paracrine feedback loop that leads to sustained
epCSC activation and proliferation and resultant cardiomyocyte
formation, long after the primary stimulus has disappeared.
Sustained Release of GF Using a Bioscaffold
Previous proof-of-concept experiments validating the UPy
hydrogel showed that the hydrogel created a successful gra￾dient of growth factors toward the infarcted area [13]. As a
next step, the present study was undertaken to determine the
therapeutic value provided by the sustained release of IGF-1/
HGF using the UPy hydrogel carrier. This subsequent report
advances initial findings by showing that IGF-1/HGF incor￾porated in the UPy hydrogel increased the effect of IGF-1/
HGF therapy, but did not show statistical significance com￾pared to equal concentrations of IGF-1/HGF dissolved in
saline in both functional and histological endpoints (Fig. 2
and Table 1). However, when comparing the different growth
factor-treated groups to the control-treated animals, only
UPy-GF-treated animals showed improvement with statis￾tical significance as opposed to the GF group in which
significance was not reached for ESV and EF as well as
several histological outcomes (i.e., CM hypertrophy, eCSC
numbers in the MI border zone). Altogether, there is a
highly consistent trend visible showing that the UPy-GF￾treated animals outperformed the GF-treated animals on all
levels of outcome measures (i.e., cardiomyocyte formation,
number of c-kitpos eCSCs, cardiac function).
Clinical Perspective
By avoiding myocardial biopsies to extract eCSCs that need
ex vivo upscaling to acquire clinically relevant numbers for
subsequent delivery, one escapes from several drawbacks of
Fig. 6 IGF-1/HGF treatment increases the epCSC compartment and

various cell types, such as (i) c-kitpos CD45neg epCSCs, (ii) c-kitneg

cellular products as a novel treatment for ischemic heart
disease [24, 25]. First and foremost, cellular therapy requires
dedicated clinical centers that have both the expertise and
high-cost resources for isolating, culturing, and handling stem
cell products to pursue cardiac repair. Secondly, it relies on an
available time span necessary for culturing stem/progenitor
cells that is not present as in the case of acute myocardial
infarction. Therefore, in situ activation of the eCSC compart￾ment could bypass the aforementioned limitations of exoge￾nous stem cell therapy. This holds true in particular for the
chronic MI patients, in which aging and comorbidities also
reduce the potency of the eCSC compartment. One particular
aspect is the dramatic increase in cellular senescence of eCSCs
to ∼70 % of all eCSCs in aged mice [26]. Work by Torella and
colleagues [26] further showed that growth factors such as
IGF-1 are capable of reversing this process in aged mice and
restoring the function of aged senescent eCSCs.
Previous work on the therapeutic efficacy of IGF-1/HGF
relied on transepicardial injections during open-chest surgery
as the route of delivery [8, 10, 27]. In contrast, we used a
percutaneous approach with the NOGA catheter system to
acquire information on the infarct location and used the
MYOSTAR catheter for targeted intramyocardial delivery in
the peri-infarct/border zone of the chronic MI. As a conse￾quence, the entire study protocol employed in this present
work is clinically feasible and can be performed at a conven￾tional catheterization laboratory. Work to address the use of
UPy hydrogel synthesized under GMP conditions for human
use is currently in progress.
Limitations
Given the dynamicity in the temporal expression pattern of
Ki67 in cycling cells, our histology, at best, provides a
“snapshot” of cellular homeostasis in the post-MI heart at
1 month follow-up [28]. Therefore, we cannot draw inferences
on the absolute number of newly formed cardiomyocytes in
any of the treatment groups. Although we specifically char￾acterized the contribution of tissue-specific c-kitpos CD54neg
eCSCs, we cannot exclude that other stem/progenitor cell
populations or other mechanisms of cardiomyogenesis con￾tributed to new cardiac cell formation and, if so, to what
extent. Furthermore, given the immature nature and low num￾bers of small, newly formed cardiomyocytes, the increase in
cardiac function is most likely also caused by numerous other
unknown factors, commonly designated as “paracrine effects”
[29, 30]. The identification of these biological processes can
provide further clues to improve growth factor-mediated car￾diac repair and regeneration. Unraveling hereof is warranted
in order to advance the cardioregenerative field to clinically
relevant levels of myocardial regeneration.
Last, although experimental in vitro work on release by
UPy hydrogel showed an ∼3-day sustained release of both
IGF-1 and HGF, extrapolation toward the in vivo situation
warrants certain caution. Since we did not choose to kill
additional animals shortly after the GF injections, we cannot
conclude whether the highest improvement in LV function
seen in the UPy-GF group was actually caused by the
sustained release of growth factors, or that the hydrogel
was capable of retaining higher initial levels of growth
factors compared to the saline solution. Despite careful
placement of the intramyocardial injections, there is con￾siderable backflow into the left ventricular cavity and/or
venous drainage that could be potentially be minimized by
the UPy hydrogel.
Conclusion
In summary, four major conclusions can be deducted from this
study: (1) targeted intramyocardial IGF-1/HGF injections at￾tenuated pathologic cardiac remodeling and increased the
formation of small, newly formed cardiomyocytes in the
border zone of the infarct scar in the post-MI adult pig heart;
(2) IGF-1/HGF admission gave rise to a robust increase of the
c-kitpos epCSC compartment of the heart and increased their
commitment toward the cardiomyogenic and vasculature
lineage; (3) intramyocardial IGF-1/HGF injections in the
border zone of the infarct scar led to an improvement in
cardiac systolic and diastolic function when compared to
control-treated hearts; (4) the use of a smart hydrogel
carrier that acts as a sustained-release platform increased
the effectiveness of growth factor therapy as a treatment
for chronic MI. Taken together, these results provide a
rationale to further develop experimental work on growth
factor therapy for myocardial repair and regeneration.
Moreover, these findings identify the UPy hydrogel carrier
system as a practical, affordable, and widely applicable
therapeutic strategy designated to counteract the adverse
remodeling and natural disease progression in the post-MI
heart that would otherwise lead to congestive heart failure.
