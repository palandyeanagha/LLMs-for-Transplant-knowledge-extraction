Abstract
A 44-year-old woman with iron deficiency anemia was on a continuous course of intravenous saccharated
ferric oxide (SFO). She came to our hospital because of right hip joint pain. She was found to have hypo￾phosphatemia caused by impaired phosphorus resorption and her fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) levels
were elevated. Therefore, she was diagnosed with FGF-23-related osteomalacia due to SFO administration.
Discontinuation of the SFO treatment rapidly improved the impaired phosphorus resorption and also normal￾ized the blood levels of phosphorus and FGF-23. During the treatment with SFO, it is important to regularly
measure the blood levels of phosphorus in order to prevent the occurrence of osteomalacia.

Introduction
Although saccharated ferric oxide (SFO) is frequently
used to treat iron deficiency anemia in Japan, reports have
indicated that long-term treatment can lead to osteomala￾cia (1, 2). Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) has recently
been identified as a new factor involved in phosphorus regu￾lation, and has been reported to be involved in various
phosphorus-related metabolic disorders (3). We herein report
a case of osteomalacia caused by long-term administration
of SFO, which led to elevated blood FGF-23 levels, in
which discontinuation of SFO ultimately both normalized
the FGF-23 levels and mitigated the osteomalacia.
Case Report
The patient was a 44-year-old woman who had visited
our hospital for a consultation, complaining of pain between
the ribs and in the right hip joint. She had grown and devel￾oped normally as a child, and neither drank nor smoked.
She had been sufficiently exposed to the sun. In her 20s, she
was diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia due to uterine
fibroids. She could not take oral iron supplements because
of the gastrointestinal side effects; therefore, her treatment
has consisted of continuous intravenous SFO administration.
When the anemia worsened in 2007, the SFO dose was in￾creased to 120 mg/week. Around November 2007, she de￾veloped pain between the ribs and in the right hip joint with
no particular provocation, and by June 2008, she had diffi￾culty walking because of the right hip joint pain. She had
visited another hospital to undergo orthopedic surgery at
that time. However, when blood testing revealed hypophos￾phatemia, she was admitted to our hospital to undergo a de￾tailed examination.
The physical findings at the time of admission were as
follows: height, 159.8 cm (no loss of height); weight, 54.8
kg; body temperature, 36.1℃; and blood pressure, 109/69
mmHg. Her overall appearance did not indicate any bone
deformity. Her palpebral conjunctivae appeared anemic, and
there was tenderness around the right hip joint. Although
she had received intravenous SFO until three weeks prior to
the presentation, her blood findings showed iron-deficiency
anemia (hemoglobin, 9.9 g/dL; mean corpuscular volume,
92.8 fL; serum iron, 27 μg/dL; total iron binding capacity,
301 μg/dL; transferrin saturation 9.0%; ferritin, 58 ng/mL).
The results of the biochemical analyses were as follows:
calcium, 8.2 mg/dL; phosphorus, 1.1 mg/dL; intact parathy￾１The First Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Occupational and Environmental Health, Japan and ２Division of

roid hormone, 106 pg/mL, which indicated secondary hyper￾parathyroidism. It is noteworthy that, despite the presence of
hypophosphatemia, the maximal tubular phosphate reabsorp￾tion corrected for the glomerular filtration rate (TmP/GFR)
was low at 0.95 mg/dL, the 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin [1,25
(OH) 2D] level was relatively low at 20 pg/mL, and FGF-23
was elevated at 30.2 pg/mL. She was also vitamin D defi￾cient, with levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] at 14
ng/mL. In terms of bone metabolism markers, the levels of
alkaline phosphatase (206 IU/L), bone-specific alkaline
phosphatase (24.7 ng/mL), and urinary type I collagen
cross-linked N-telopeptide (27.1 nM for bone collagen
equivalents/mM creatinine) were all within the normal
physiological ranges.
During the imaging studies, bone X-ray radiography (ver￾tebra, thigh bone) revealed no evidence of bone thinning or
fractures, and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry of the lum￾bar vertebrae showed that the bone density was preserved,
with a bone mineral density of 1.067 g/cm2 and a T-score of
0.5. On the other hand, bone scintigraphy showed abnormal
accumulation in the ribs and right femoral neck consistent
with the sites of pain (Fig. 1), and magnetic resonance im￾aging (MRI) also showed a fractured right femoral neck
(Fig. 2).
The above results suggested hypophosphatemic osteo￾malacia caused by SFO, and the first step of treatment was
to discontinue the SFO. Two weeks after discontinuation of
SFO, the TmP/GFR had normalized to 4.20 mg/dL and the
blood phosphorus levels had improved to 1.9 mg/dL. More￾over, two months after SFO had been discontinued, the
phosphorus level was found to have normalized to 3.5 mg/
dL, while the FGF-23 level had also normalized to 8.6 pg/
mL. These findings suggest that, at the time of admission,
transitional secretion of FGF-23 was caused by SFO, and
this had been involved in the hypophosphatemia. Nine
months after SFO had been discontinued, the femoral neck
fractures had been improved, as determined by MRI
(Fig. 2). At that time, the patient’s pain had almost disap￾peared, and she was able to continue walking and engaging
in her hobby, golf, without difficulty. In addition, her 1,25
(OH)2D level was normalized to 53.8 pg/mL, suggesting
that FGF-23 leads to a decrease in the serum 1,25(OH)2D
levels. On the other hand, the low 25(OH)D level persisted
unaltered, suggesting that her vitamin D deficient state was
independent of the effects of SFO. She also underwent a
radical hysterectomy to treat the uterine fibroids causing her
iron-deficiency anemia.
Discussion
Osteomalacia is the pathological state of decreased bone
strength occurring when vitamin D deficiency or chronic hy￾pophosphatemia impairs bone calcification (4). In cases with
adult-onset, the disease causes pain in the musculoskeletal
system and decreases muscle strength, and bone fractures
and deformities can develop as the disease progresses. Al￾though no bone biopsy was taken in the present case, a
clinical diagnosis of osteomalacia was reached on the basis
of the blood levels of calcium, phosphorus, the bone scintig￾raphy findings, and the MRI findings of the hip joint.
The known factors causing osteomalacia include insuffi￾cient dietary vitamin D intake, vitamin D dependence, and
chronic hypophosphatemia caused by renal tubular dam￾age (4). Some reports have implicated the long-term admini￾stration of SFO and iron polymaltose as being iatrogenic
causes of osteomalacia via the induction of chronic hypo￾phosphatemia (1, 2, 5). SFO has been suggested to cause
hypophosphatemia via decreased phosphorus resorption by
the renal tubules, thus resulting in it being filtered out from
the glomeruli and deposited in the tubular epithelium, pro-

voking tubular damage (6). However, histological testing in
rat and human kidneys has not found iron deposition or
other abnormalities in the tubules, leading to the hypothesis
that there is a mechanism other than decreased phosphorus
resorption that underlies this condition (7, 8).
FGF-23 has been identified to be a new peptide that acts
as a phosphorus regulation factor (9). It is composed of 227
amino acids, and is secreted from osteocytes. It inhibits
phosphorus resorption by decreasing the expression of type
IIa and type IIc Na-P cotransporters in the renal proximal
tubules (10). FGF-23 also decreases the expression of 25
(OH)D-1α-hydroxylase, which is a vitamin D-metabolizing
enzyme in the renal tubules, while also promoting the ex￾pression of 25(OH)D-24-hydroxylase. This leads to a de￾crease in the 1,25(OH)2D levels in the blood, and subse￾quently decreases the phosphorus absorption by the
bowel (10).
Accordingly, an excessive expression of FGF-23 over the
long term can lead to hypophosphatemic osteomalacia
(FGF-23-related osteomalacia). The types of FGF-23-related
osteomalacia include tumor-induced osteomalacia, X-linked
hypophosphatemic osteomalacia, autosomal dominant and
recessive hypophosphatemic osteomalacia, McCune-Albright
syndrome, and hypophosphatemic osteomalacia caused by
fibrous dysplasia (3). Recent reports have shown that intra￾venous administration of SFO elevates the FGF-23 concen￾tration in the blood and can lead to the onset of hypophos￾phatemic osteomalacia, and SFO-induced osteomalacia has
been categorized as a FGF-23-related osteomalacia (11). Be￾cause hypophosphatemic osteomalacia is provoked by nei￾ther chondroitin sulfate iron colloid nor cideferron, which
are also intravenous iron supplements, it seems unlikely that
it is the iron itself that is active in promoting FGF-23 secre￾tion, and much remains unclear about the mechanism under￾lying the condition. The present case also exhibited hypo￾phosphatemia and an inappropriate amount of FGF-23 secre￾tion following the intravenous administration of SFO. The
fact that the phosphorus levels and FGF-23 secretion quickly
normalized after the discontinuation of SFO suggest that this
was a case of FGF-23-related osteomalacia caused by SFO
administration. When hypophosphatemia is present with a
value of less than 2.5 mg/dL, if the level of FGF-23 is
higher than 30 pg/mL, the condition is diagnosed as FGF￾23-related hypophosphatemia (12).
The present case also included confirmation of a de￾creased 25(OH)D level in the blood, which persisted for
nine months after SFO was discontinued. This suggests that
the circumstances of the present case included a vitamin D
deficiency that was independent of the dynamics of FGF-23.
We explored the possibility of administering activated vita￾min D, but given that the patient’s symptoms had improved
and it was undesirable to begin administration of a new
drug, a dietary treatment was introduced instead, and her
progress is currently being monitored.
We herein summarized our experience with a case in
which long-term administration of SFO had led to FGF-23-
related osteomalacia. SFO is frequently used to treat iron
deficiency anemia, but appropriate management must be un￾dertaken to ensure bone health, and the treatment should be
discontinued if necessary. If long-term administration is un￾avoidable, it is very important to utilize the minimum re￾quired dose and for the shortest duration necessary, and to
regularly measure the blood phosphorus levels to avoid the
onset of osteomalacia.
