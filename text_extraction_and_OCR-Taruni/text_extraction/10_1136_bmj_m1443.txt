Abstract
Objective
To evaluate viral loads at different stages of disease 
progression in patients infected with the 2019 severe 
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS￾CoV-2) during the first four months of the epidemic in 
Zhejiang province, China.
Design
Retrospective cohort study.
Setting
A designated hospital for patients with covid-19 in 
Zhejiang province, China.
Participants
96 consecutively admitted patients with laboratory 
confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection: 22 with mild disease 
and 74 with severe disease. Data were collected from 
19 January 2020 to 20 March 2020.
Main outcome measures
Ribonucleic acid (RNA) viral load measured in 
respiratory, stool, serum, and urine samples. 
Cycle threshold values, a measure of nucleic acid 
concentration, were plotted onto the standard 
curve constructed on the basis of the standard 
product. Epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory 
characteristics and treatment and outcomes data 
were obtained through data collection forms from 
electronic medical records, and the relation between 
clinical data and disease severity was analysed.
Results
3497 respiratory, stool, serum, and urine samples 
were collected from patients after admission and 
evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 RNA viral load. Infection 
was confirmed in all patients by testing sputum 
and saliva samples. RNA was detected in the stool 
of 55 (59%) patients and in the serum of 39 (41%) 
patients. The urine sample from one patient was 
positive for SARS-CoV-2. The median duration of virus 
in stool (22 days, interquartile range 17-31 days) was 
significantly longer than in respiratory (18 days, 13-29 
days; P=0.02) and serum samples (16 days, 11-21 
days; P<0.001). The median duration of virus in the 
respiratory samples of patients with severe disease 
(21 days, 14-30 days) was significantly longer than 
in patients with mild disease (14 days, 10-21 days; 
P=0.04). In the mild group, the viral loads peaked in 
respiratory samples in the second week from disease 
onset, whereas viral load continued to be high during 
the third week in the severe group. Virus duration was 
longer in patients older than 60 years and in male 
patients.
Co nclusion
The duration of SARS-CoV-2 is significantly longer in 
stool samples than in respiratory and serum samples, 
highlighting the need to strengthen the management 
of stool samples in the prevention and control of the 
epidemic, and the virus persists longer with higher 
load and peaks later in the respiratory tissue of 
patients with severe disease.
Introduction
A novel human coronavirus first detected during an 
unexplained cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, 
China in December 2019 has spread globally.1 2 As 
of 22 March 2020, the newly emerged severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 
(genus Betacoronavirus, family Coronaviridae) has 
been reported in 190 countries with more than 300000 
confirmed cases and 14510 deaths.
3
 A predominant 
number of cases has occurred in China,4
 with early 
clinical characterisation showing that 13.8% of those 
infected developed severe disease, and death occurred 
in 2.3% of the cases.
Viral load measurements from tissue samples are 
indicative of active virus replication and are routinely 
used to monitor severe viral respiratory tract infections,

What is already known on this topic
As of 9 April 2020, more than 1.5 million people globally have been affected by 
covid-19, and the numbers continue to increase rapidly
SARS-CoV-2 viral loads have been reported from respiratory, stool, serum, and 
urine samples in a small number of patients; however, changes in viral load 
during disease progression of different severities is not known
What this study adds
The duration of SARS-CoV-2 is significantly longer in stool samples than 
in respiratory and serum samples, highlighting the need to strengthen the 
management of stool samples in the prevention and control of the epidemic
The virus persists longer with higher load and peaks later in the respiratory 
tissue of patients with severe disease
To prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 it is therefore necessary to carry out strict 
management during each stage of severe disease

including clinical progression, response to treatment, 
cure, and relapse.5-7 One study described changes in 
viral loads in samples from the upper respiratory tract 
of 18 patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19, 
an infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2), 
showing that the viral loads were equally high among 
asymptomatic patients and those with symptoms.8
However, the viral load dynamics in lower respiratory 
tract and other tissue samples and the relation 
between viral load and disease severity is unknown—
information that are important for the formulation of 
disease control strategies and clinical treatment.
We systematically estimated the viral loads in more 
than 3000 samples collected from 96 patients after 
admission who were infected with SARS-CoV-2, and 
analysed the temporal change in viral loads and the 
correlation between viral loads in different sample 
types and disease severity.
Methods
Study design
This was a retrospective cohort study of patients with 
laboratory confirmed covid-19 admitted consecutively 
to the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, 
Zhejiang University from 19 January 2020 to 15 
February 2020. This major general hospital has 3000 
beds and serves as a designated hospital for patients 
with covid-19 in Zhejiang province.
Sample collection and laboratory confirmation
After admission, respiratory, serum, stool, and urine 
samples were collected daily whenever possible to 
determine the amount of SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid 
(RNA) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. 
Sputum samples were collected from the respiratory 
tract of patients with sputum, and saliva after deep 
cough was collected from patients without sputum.9
Blood samples were collected in a special whole blood 
collection tube, and urine and stool samples were 
collected in a special sterile container. All medical staff 
were equipped with personal protection equipment for 
biosafety level 3 during sampling, including solid front 
wraparound gowns, goggles, and N95 respirators.
Viral RNA was extracted using the MagNA Pure 96 
(Roche, Basel, Switzerland), and quantitative reverse 
transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed using 
a China Food and Drug Administration approved 
commercial kit specific for SARS-CoV-2 detection (BoJie, 
Shanghai, China). The detection limit of the ORFab1 qRT￾PCR assays was about 1000 copies per millilitre. Samples 
with cycle threshold (Ct) values of ≤38.0 were considered 
positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Samples with Ct values 
>38.0 were repeated, and samples with repeated Ct 
values of >38.0 and samples with undetectable Ct values 
were considered negative. Viral load was calculated by 
plotting Ct values onto the standard curve constructed 
based on the standard product.
Data collection
The research team of the First Affiliated Hospital, 
College of Medicine, Zhejiang University analysed the 
medical records of patients. Epidemiological, clinical, 
and laboratory characteristics and treatment and 
outcomes data were obtained through data collection 
forms from hospital electronic medical records. A 
trained team of doctors reviewed the data. The clinical 
data included personal characteristics, comorbidities, 
date of symptom onset, symptoms and signs, timing of 
antiviral treatment, and progression and resolution of 
clinical illness. Comorbidities documented included 
diabetes mellitus, heart disease, chronic lung disease, 
renal failure, liver disease, HIV infection, cancer, and 
receipt of immunosuppressive treatment, including 
corticosteroids. We considered that the symptoms 
started when any of fever, cough, chills, dizziness, 
headache, and fatigue appeared.
The severity of illness was evaluated according to 
the sixth edition of the Guideline for Diagnosis and 
Treatment of SARS-CoV-2 issued by the National Health 
Commission of the People’s Republic of China.10 Mild 
cases include non-pneumonia or mild pneumonia. 
Severe disease refers to dyspnoea, respiratory rate ≥30/
min, blood oxygen saturation ≤93%, partial pressure 
of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio 
<300, or lung infiltrates >50% within 24 to 48 hours. 
Patients who test negative for SARS-CoV-2 for two 
consecutive days in respiratory samples are considered 
to be clear of infection.
Statistical analysis
For most variables, we calculated descriptive statistics, 
such as medians with interquartile ranges (for data with 
skewed distribution) and proportions (percentages). 
Statistical comparisons between the mild and severe 
groups were evaluated by t test, analysis of variance, 
Mann-Whitney U tests, and Kruskal-Wallis tests when 
appropriate. To explore the variation of viral load 
across the days since symptom onset, we calculated 
the median of viral load each day, followed by fitting 
smooth lines using a loess method.11 For this analysis, 
we only included patients with viral loads monitored 
for more than five days in respiratory and stool 
samples. Statistical analyses were performed using 
the R software package, v3.6.2. A P value of <0.05 was 
considered significant.
Patient and public involvement
This was a retrospective case series study and no 
patients were directly involved in the study design, 
setting the research questions, or the outcome 
measures. No patients were asked to advise on 
interpretation or writing up of results.
Results
Table 1 shows the clinical characteristics of 96 patients 
with confirmed covid-19: 22 with mild disease and 
74 with severe disease. The median age was 55 years 
(interquartile range 44.3-64.8). Of the patients infected 
in Wuhan, a significantly higher proportion were in 
the severe group (35%) than in the mild group (9%). 
Hypertension (36%) and diabetes mellitus (11%) 
were the most common underlying disease. Most of

the patients developed fever (89%) and cough (56%). 
Overall, 78 (81%) patients received glucocorticoids 
and 33 (34%) antibiotic treatment. All patients 
received antiviral treatment comprising interferon α
inhalation, lopinavir-ritonavir combination, arbidol, 
favipiravir, and darunavir-cobicistat combination. 
Among them, 63 (66%) started antiviral treatment 
within five days from illness onset and 29 (30%) more 
than five days after illness onset. Thirty (41%) patients 
with severe disease were admitted to the intensive 
care unit. By 20 March, all patients tested negative for 
SARS-CoV-2, nine (9% of all patients) patients with 
severe disease were still in hospital, and no deaths 
had occurred. Supplementary figure S1 shows the 
outcome among patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, 
and supplementary table S1 the laboratory findings.
SARS-CoV-2 detection rates during disease 
progression and between sample types
A total of 1846 respiratory samples (668 sputum 
and 1178 saliva) were collected (average 18 samples 
per patient (range 3-40 samples)); 842 stool samples 
(7 samples per patient (1-32 samples)); 629 serum 
samples (7 samples per patient (1-20 samples)), and 
180 urine samples (1 sample for each patient (1-6 
samples)). Supplementary figure S2 shows the daily 
collection of different sample types.
SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed in all 96 
patients by testing respiratory samples. Of these 
patients, viral nucleic acid was detected in the stool 
samples of 59% and serum samples of 41%. Rates 
of SARS-CoV-2 detection in the respiratory samples 
gradually decreased from 95% in the first week of 
symptom onset to 54% in the fourth week, with 
subsequent respiratory samples showing negative 
results, whereas the positive rate in stool samples and 
serum samples gradually increased from the first week 
and then decreased from the third week. In addition, 
the rate of detection in serum samples was higher in 
patients with severe disease than in patients with 
mild disease (45% v 27%), but the difference was not 
significant. The detection rate in stool did not differ 
between patients with mild disease and patients with 
severe disease. Only one urine sample collected from 
a critically ill patient on day 10 was positive for SARS￾CoV-2 (table 2).

Correlation between viral duration in different 
sample types and disease severity
The median duration of virus in stool samples (22 days, 
interquartile range 17-31 days) was significantly longer 
than in respiratory (18 days, 13-29 days; P=0.02) and 
serum samples (16 days, 11-21 days; P<0.001) (fig 
1). In the respiratory samples, the median duration of 
virus in patients with severe disease (21 days, 14-30 
days) was significantly longer than in patients with 
mild disease (14 days, 10-21 days; P=0.04) (fig 1), 
whereas no significant difference was observed in the 
duration of virus between stool and serum samples 
among patients with different disease severities (fig 1). 
Supplementary figures S3-S5 show the duration of 
virus in different sample types in each patient.
Correlation between viral load in different sample 
types and disease severity
Viral load differed significantly by sample type, with 
respiratory samples showing the highest, followed by stool 
samples, and serum samples showing the lowest (fig 2). 
In respiratory samples, patients with severe disease had 
significantly higher viral loads than patients with mild 
disease (fig 2). Viral loads in stool and serum samples 
showed no significant difference between patients with 
mild disease and patients with severe disease (fig 2).
Using a loess regression analysis, we found that in 
the mild group, the viral load in respiratory samples 
was greater during the initial stages of the disease, 
reached a peak in the second week from disease onset, 
and was followed by lower loads (fig 3). In the severe 
group, however, the viral load in respiratory samples 
continued to be high during the third and fourth 
weeks after disease onset (fig 3). The viral load of stool 
samples was highest during the third and fourth weeks 
after disease onset (fig 3).
Factors associated with duration of virus and viral 
load
We found that types and timeliness of antiviral 
treatments had no overall effect on the duration of the 
virus and viral load. In the severe group, the duration 
of the virus was significantly higher in patients treated 
with glucocorticoids continuously for more than 10 
days than in patients treated with glucocorticoids 
continuously for less than 10 days, whereas different 
treatments had no effect on viral load (supplementary 
table S2). When patients with severe disease were 
stratified, the duration of the virus was significantly 
longer in men than in women, and significantly longer 
in patients older than 60 years than younger (fig 4).
Discussion
We have systematically described the clinical charac￾teristics of 96 patients with covid-19 and described 
the dynamic changes of severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) loads and 
disease progression in 3497 samples of multiple 
types, revealing the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 
replication and clearance by host defence mechanisms. 
The median duration of virus in respiratory samples 
was 18 days, which was consistent with the median 
duration of 20 days for Middle East respiratory 
syndrome (MERS).12 Peak viral shedding in respiratory 
specimens of patients with severe acute respiratory 
syndrome (SARS) occurred after about 10 to 12 days 
from symptom onset,13 14 which is similar to the peak 
observed for SARS-CoV-2 in our study. Consistent 
with earlier reports of SARS-CoV-2,15 we found 
differences in the viral load in patients with different 
disease severities, those with severe disease showing 
a significantly higher viral load than those with mild 
disease, which suggests that viral load can be used to 
assess prognosis.
Studies have found that the peak load of SARS￾CoV-2 in upper respiratory tract specimens was during 
the early stages of the disease8 16; however, we found 
that the duration of virus shedding in lower respiratory 
tract samples was longer, and peak viral shedding 
occurred after about two weeks from symptom onset. 
These findings are important for effective control 
and prevention of the epidemic as it suggests strict

management of the whole disease process in patients 
with SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we also found that 
the viral load in patients with severe disease was 
significantly higher than in patients with mild disease, 
suggesting that high viral load might be a risk factor for 
severe disease.
Active replication of SARS in the gut has been 
shown through live virus isolation.17 During 2003, 
the prevalence of SARS RNA in stool samples was so 
high that testing of stool was proposed as a reliable 
and sensitive way to routinely diagnose the disease,18 
19 whereas MERS RNA was found in only 15% of stool 
samples, with a low RNA concentration.20 In this 
study, we detected SARS-CoV-2 in the stool samples 
from 59% of patients and found that the duration of 
virus was longer and viral load peaked later in stool 
samples compared with respiratory samples. Based on 
this study, we think the role of faecal excretion in the 
spread of SARS-CoV-2 cannot be ignored; however, the 
importance of high detection in stool samples in the 
prevention and control of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic 
requires comprehensive and careful evaluation. We 
rarely found SARS-CoV-2 RNA in urine samples in this 
study, although viral RNA detection rates of up to 50% 
have been found in the urine of patients with SARS.18 19
A clear difference between SARS and SARS-CoV-2 
was in the detection of viral RNA in serum. Evidence 
has been found of SARS virus replicating in circulating 
lymphocytes, monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic 
cells, albeit at low levels.21-23 In some studies, up to 
79% of serum samples were found to contain SARS 
RNA during the first week of illness, and around 50% 
during the second week.24-26 The rates were similar in 
MERS.20 In this study, we found that the detection rate 
of SARS-CoV-2 in serum was only 41%.
At present, the therapeutic effect of glucocorticoids 
and antiviral drugs in patients with SARS-CoV-2 is 
unclear.27 28 We found that the duration of treatment 
with glucocorticoids was positively correlated with 
viral duration in patients with severe disease. As we 
did not analysis the type and dose of antiviral drugs 
and glucocorticoids, however, we cannot evaluate 
the effect of antiviral drugs and glucocorticoids. 
Monitoring the effectiveness of antiviral drugs and 
glucocorticoids needs to be validated by multicentre 
randomised studies.
A sex dependent increase in disease severity after 
infection with pathogenic coronavirus was reported for 
both SARS and MERS,29 30 and this was also found for 
SARS-CoV-2.31 In this study, we found that the duration 
of virus was significantly longer in men than in 
women. Our results shed light on the causes of disease 
severity in men in terms of the duration of the virus. In 
addition to differences in immune status between men 
and women, it has also been reported to be related to 
differences in hormone levels.32 In this study, we also 
found a correlation between age and duration of virus, 
which partly explains the high rate of severe illness 
in patients older than 60 years. This is partly because 
of immunosenescence.33 Another reason is that older

people have higher levels of angiotensin converting 
enzyme 2 in their alveoli,34 which is thought to be a 
receptor for novel coronaviruses.
Limitations of this study
Our study has several limitations. Firstly, this study is 
a single centre cohort study, and the sample size was 
insufficient to compare treatment effects in different 
subgroups, which could lead to an unbalanced 
distribution of confounders when evaluating viral 
shedding and viral load. Secondly, viral load is 
influenced by many factors. The quality of collected 
samples directly affects the viral load, so the study of 
viral load only partly reflects the amount of virus in the 
body. Thirdly, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) cannot 
distinguish between viable and non-viable virus and 
does not reflect the replication level of the virus in 
different tissue. However, PCR has higher sensitivity, 
is easy to perform, and is widely used in the detection 
of viral load.35 In addition, only collecting samples 
from patients who remain in hospital could overinflate 
estimates of viral load and duration at a later time 
point. Finally, since accurate diagnosis was not 
available during the early stages of the epidemic, stool 
and urine samples of the earliest infected patients were 
not collected until early February, hence we recruited 
patients with positive respiratory samples and could 
not evaluate patients with negative respiratory samples 
against other sample types.
Conclusion
The duration of SARS-CoV-2 is significantly longer in 
stool samples than in respiratory and serum samples, 
highlighting the need to strengthen the management 
of stool samples in the prevention and control of the 
epidemic, especially for patients in the later stages of 
the disease. Compared with patients with mild disease, 
those with severe disease showed longer duration of 
SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory samples, higher viral load, 
and a later shedding peak. These findings suggest 
that reducing viral loads through clinical means and 
strengthening management during each stage of severe 
disease should help to prevent the spread of the virus.
