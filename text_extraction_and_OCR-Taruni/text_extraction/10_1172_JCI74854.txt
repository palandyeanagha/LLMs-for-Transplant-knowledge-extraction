The lymphatic vasculature revisited

Lymphatic vessels constitute a ubiquitous countercurrent system to the blood vasculature that returns interstitial 
fluid, salts, small molecules, resorbed fat, and cells to the bloodstream. They serve as conduits to lymph nodes and 
are essential for multiple physiologic activities. However, they are also hijacked by cancer cells to establish initial 
lymph node metastases, as well as by infectious agents and parasites. Despite these obvious important functions in 
human pathologies, a more detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of the 
lymphatic vasculature has trailed that of the blood vasculature for many years, mainly because critical specific char￾acteristics of lymphatic endothelial cells were discovered only recently. In this Review series, several major aspects 
of the active and passive involvement of the lymphatic vasculature in human disease and physiology are presented, 
with a focus on translational findings.
Many scientific fields develop in waves that vary in frequency and 
amplitude, with rapid progress initiated by serendipitous find￾ings in seemingly unrelated fields. Research on the structure and 
function of the lymphatic vasculature exemplifies this model. As 
presented in this Review series, novel insights into the involvement 
of lymphatic vessels in human disease and physiology have not 
only provided additional information on pathogenesis, but have 
changed the prevailing paradigms of disease mechanisms as a pre￾lude to improved targeted therapies.
Historically, the identification of lymphatic vessels relied on 
their content, known as “white blood” (1). Their macroscopic 
visualization was made possible by intradermal injection of col￾loid tracers in fresh cadavers, and striking examples of the results 
are provided by the anatomical wax models produced in Florence 
around 1770 and on display in the Josephinum in Vienna (www.
josephinum.ac.at). A model of the cervical lymphatic network is 
depicted on the cover of this series. These techniques primarily 
detect large branches of the lymphatic system, i.e., the collecting 
vessels that serve as peristaltic pumps to move the lymphatic fluid 
toward the thoracic duct by a precisely coordinated contraction of 
the smooth muscles in their media, while strategically positioned 
valves prevent reflux. Recent advances in our understanding of 
smooth muscle contraction (2) and formation and stability of the 
valves (3) have clarified these processes. In this series, Eva Sevick￾Muraca and colleagues (4) summarize the current state of in vivo 
visualization that reveals the lymphatic vasculature in much bet￾ter resolution. Though our understanding of the collecting ves￾sels has improved, we are progressively gaining detailed knowledge 
concerning the initial microvascular segment, which is arguably 
the most functionally relevant part of the vascular lymphatic 
tree and hence the topic of most Reviews in this series. Under the 
microscope the initial lymphatic capillaries are composed of sacs 
of endothelial cells and are devoid of pericytes. These capillaries 
merge into a precollector vessel segment with few pericytes that 
opens into the collectors (Figure 1).
At the center of the current increase in lymphatic research are 
new insights into the biology of the lymphatic endothelial cells 
(LECs). This phase was heralded by detailed ultrastructural inves￾tigations of initial lymphatic vessels (5). The critical breakthrough 
to a functional understanding was achieved with the discovery of 
the main lymphangiogenic growth factor, VEGFC, and its recep￾tor, VEGFR3 (6). This was followed by the identification of pro￾teins that discriminate between endothelial cells of the lymphatic 
and blood vessel lineages (7) that can serve as selective markers 
for the localization and isolation of LECs (8, 9), a development 
reviewed by Kari Alitalo and colleagues in this series (10).
Since the lymphatic system is as branched and widely distributed 
as the blood vasculature, it is not surprising that it is involved in 
most disease processes, ranging from inflammation to metastatic 
spreading of cancers. It is becoming increasingly clear that the lym￾phatics do not just serve as passive conduits for interstitial fluid 
and cells, but are actively involved in disease, as reviewed in detail 
in this series. Below, I highlight a few selected aspects of current 
research that could become clinically relevant in the coming years.
Variability of microvascular LECs
Two populations of LECs that differ in their content of the mem￾brane mucoprotein podoplanin were identified in the dermal 
microvasculature (11, 12): endothelial cells expressing high levels 
of podoplanin are localized to the initial capillaries, while those 
with lower levels of podoplanin are found in precollector segments. 
Interestingly, these two populations are different lineages that dif￾fer in gene expression. This is presumably of functional impor￾tance, as the podoplanin-rich cells produce CCL21 that would 
attract, among others, dendritic cells, while the podoplanin-low 
cells in the precollectors secrete CCL27, which attracts CCR10+
inflammatory and neoplastic T lymphocytes. These two lymphatic 
endothelial sublineages also express different levels of Notch, 
which regulates podoplanin expression (13). These results provide 
the first indication for potential functional specialization of LECs 
in different parts of the lymphatic vasculature that could poten￾tially be exploited to re-route inflammatory and immune cells.
The role of macrophages in lymphangiogenesis
The perplexing plasticity of monocytes/macrophages has been 
extended to their involvement in neolymphangiogenesis. They 
contribute in at least two ways, namely as a source of VEGFC after 
appropriate stimulation, or by transdifferentiation into LECs that 
integrate into the growing capillaries (ref. 14 and Figure 2). This 
was originally shown for tumor-associated macrophages (15) and 
in kidney transplants in the course of organ rejection (16). Most 
impressively, transdifferentiation was demonstrated by direct 
observation in the inflammatory model of corneal wounding, in

which lymphangiogenesis was abolished when macrophages were 
depleted (17). As potential lymphangioblastic precursors, a large 
pool of about 50% of CD14+ monocytes was identified in the cir￾culation. These monocytes were found to constitutively express 
VEGFR3 and turn on expression of podoplanin and several other 
lymphatic markers when cultured for a prolonged period (16). 
Recent evidence indicates that cells of the adaptive immune sys￾tem are able to increase (18) or suppress (19) lymphangiogenesis, 
as reviewed by Gou Young Koh and colleagues (20) in this series. 
These findings are of potential practical importance, as they could 
provide the basis for novel therapeutic strategies to support pre￾cisely targeted neolymphangiogenesis. An in-depth understanding 
of the development of the lymphatic vasculature, as presented here 
by Ying Yang and Guillermo Oliver (21), might also provide fur￾ther clues on how to regrow lymphatic vessels after interruptions. 
A practical example is the treatment of secondary lymphedemas 
that still are a threat after axillary lymphadenoectomy in breast 
cancer surgery, as detailed in this series by Peter Mortimer and 
Stanley Rockson (22).
Lymphatics in hypertension and hypercholesterolemia
A major development of clinical relevance was initiated by the 
finding that lymphangiogenesis is causally involved in the regula￾tion of Na+ storage in the skin and that Na+ overload is associated 
with massive lymphatic neoangiogenesis (23). In rodent models of 
Na+-induced hypertension, macrophages are attracted to the der￾mis and start to produce VEGFC. This is driven by the macrophage 
transcription factor TonEBP, which serves as a specific membrane 
“osmometer” for Na+ hyperosmolality and binds to the promoter 
of the VEGFC gene in macrophages. Depletion of macrophages or 
blocking of lymphangiogenesis by specific trapping of VEGFC by a 
soluble VEGFR3 ectodomain fusion protein resulted in massively 
increased sensitivity to dietary Na+ overload and severe hyperten￾sion (24). These results have been extended to humans, as hyper￾tensive patients exhibit high levels of Na+ in the skin by NMR and 
high levels of VEGFC in the circulation (25). This somewhat unex￾pected finding promises to change the paradigm of the pathogen￾esis of hypertension and may provide novel therapeutic targets for 
this common disease.
In this series, Gwendalyn Randolph and Norman Miller (26) pres￾ent another groundbreaking concept that assigns the lymphatic 
microvasculature a key role in the transport of cholesterol-rich lipo￾proteins from the interstitium to the circulation. Predictably, these 
results will be of relevance for controlling hypercholesterolemia.
Lymphangiogenesis in transplant rejection
A previously unknown and poorly understood phenomenon is the 
massive growth of lymphatic vessels in the rejection of kidney (27) 
and heart (28) transplants. The contribution of lymphatic vessels 
to the reorganization of the inflammatory rejection infiltrates in 
the formation of tertiary lymphatic organs particularly requires 
clarification, as clinicopathological studies have documented the 
counterintuitive positive correlation between lymphatic vessel 
density and clinical outcome in human renal transplants (29). In 
this series, Nancy Ruddle (30) and Melody Swartz and colleagues 
(31) discuss the roles of the lymphatic system in the formation of 
tertiary lymphatic organs and more generally in the development 
of the adaptive immune response, respectively. Understanding and 
exploiting the underlying mechanisms that regulate the traffic of 
immune cells across lymphatic vascular walls may contribute to 
the support of graft tolerance and to the course of inflammation 
and immune responses in general.
Lymph node metastasis
Carcinomas invariably form the first detectable metastases in 
regional (sentinel) and subsequently post-regional lymph nodes. 
It is established that this predicts the formation of distant organ 
metastases and thus the patient’s outcome. Despite the obvious 
clinical importance of tumor cell invasion into lymphatic vessels 
and colonization of the lymph nodes, current knowledge relies 
primarily on correlative studies. Mechanistic insights are only 
just beginning to emerge and comprise a better understanding 
of functions of the tumor microenvironment (32), the biochem￾istry of tumor cell invasion into lymphatics (33), and the transfor￾mation of the lymph node sinus into labyrinths that are lined by 
lymphatic endothelial-like cells (34), as reviewed in this series by 
Sinem Karaman and Michael Detmar (35). The knowledge in this 
field is not yet sufficiently developed to design targeted therapies 
against tumor spreading.
Perspective
The few areas of lymphatic research mentioned above and pre￾sented in the Reviews in this series are far from a complete list of 
Figure 1
Basic design of the initial segment of the lymphatic microvasculature 
of the dermis. The initial capillaries start as blind sacs. Their LECs 
form overlapping junctions, express large amounts of the membrane 
mucoprotein podoplanin (green), and release the chemokine CCL21. 
This attracts CCR7+ immune cells, such as dendritic cells and Tregs. 
The precollectors contain LECs with low amounts of podoplanin, and 
the LECs produce CCL27, which attracts inflammatory CCR10+ T lym￾phocytes. This precollector segment opens into the collecting vessels 
that are endowed with podoplanin-low endothelial cells and that form 
valves. Pericytes/mural cells partially cover the precollectors and com￾pletely ensheath collecting vessels.

fundamental biological aspects and associations with human dis￾eases. Practical medical applications are still to be expected and 
may derive from an improved understanding of (a) the relation of 
lymphatics with adipocytes, (b) the mechanisms of inflammatory 
cell attraction and migration in lymphatics, and (c) the attrac￾tion and transport of infectious agents, ranging from bacteria 
to helminthes. In regenerative medicine, new concepts of treat￾ment are required for nonsurgical therapy of lymphangiomas 
and secondary lymphedemas caused by surgical interruption of 
the lymphatic vasculature. Induction of lymphangiogenesis by 
transplantation of conditioned lymph nodes to surgically dis￾rupted areas has already reached the clinic (36).
In more general terms, lymphatics are the first barrier for anti￾gen-presenting cells that are transported into the next lymph 
node to initiate an adaptive immune response (31). Facilitating 
their entry could potentially improve the efficiency of vaccination. 
Since lymphatics also serve as conduits for tumor cells in meta￾static spreading (35), specific interference could reduce or prevent

macrophages that induce growth of existing lymphatic vessels (right; green arrows). Reproduced from the Journal of Clinical Investigation (14).

tumor cell entry and implantation into the lymph node sinus. To 
mention yet another field, the significance of the lymphatic vascu￾lar system in diabetes has also just begun to emerge (37). Finally, 
there are several diseases that are caused by genetic or neoplastic 
alterations of the LECs, including genetic forms of lymphedema, 
as presented in the Review by Miikka Vikkula (38).
These examples for potential clinical applications of insights 
into lymph vessel biology and pathology are the beginning of an 
even longer list of applicable possibilities to modify diseases that 
will keep investigators engaged for years to come. The purpose of 
this Review series is not only to summarize the rapid development 
of the field of lymphatic vessel biology over the last 15 years and to 
emphasize its relevance to human disease, but also to impress on 
the reader how much uncharted scientific territory remains to be 
explored in this still nascent field.
