Abstract
Background: Adverse fibrotic remodeling is detrimental to myocardial health and a reliable method for monitoring
the development of fibrotic remodeling may be desirable during the follow-up of patients after heart transplantation
(HTx). Quantification of diffuse myocardial fibrosis with cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) has been increasingly
applied and validated histologically in adult patients with heart disease. However, comparisons of CMR findings with
histological fibrosis burden in children are lacking. This study aimed to compare native T1 times and extracellular
volume fraction (ECV) derived from CMR with the degree of collagen on endomyocardial biopsy (EmBx), and to
investigate the association between myocardial fibrosis and clinical as well as functional markers in children after HTx.
Methods: EmBx and CMR were performed on the same day. All specimens were stained with picrosirius red. The
collagen volume fraction (CVF) was calculated as ratio of stained collagen area to total myocardial area on EmBx.
Native T1 values and ECV were measured by CMR on a mid-ventricular short axis slice, using a modified look-locker
inversion recovery approach.
Results: Twenty patients (9.9 ± 6.2 years of age; 9 girls) after HTx were prospectively enrolled, at a median of 1.3 years
(0.02–12.6 years) post HTx, and compared to 24 controls (13.9 ± 2.6 years of age; 12 girls). The mean histological CVF
was 10.0 ± 3.4%. Septal native T1 times and ECV were higher in HTx patients compared to controls (1008 ± 32 ms vs
979 ± 24 ms, p < 0.005 and 0.30 ± 0.03 vs 0.22 ± 0.03, p < 0.0001, respectively). CVF showed a moderate correlation with
native T1 (r = 0.53, p < 0.05) as well as ECV (r = 0.46, p < 0.05). Native T1 time, but not ECV and CVF, correlated with
ischemia time (r = 0.46, p < 0.05).
Conclusions: CMR-derived fibrosis markers correlate with histological degree of fibrosis on EmBx in children after HTx.
Further, native T1 times are associated with longer ischemia times.

Background
In spite of substantially improved survival following
paediatric heart transplantation (HTx) over the past two
decades [1], significant morbidity still prevails, some of
it limiting the survival of the graft organ [1, 2].
Ventricular dysfunction in HTx recipients has been
linked to previous or acute episodes of organ rejection
and to coronary allograft vasculopathy (CAV). Both rejec￾tion and CAV are suspected to cause myocardial fibrotic
remodeling [3–5] which, in turn, results in ventricular
dysfunction [6, 7]. Ultimately, adverse fibrotic remodeling
is detrimental to myocardial health [8, 9]. Since the devel￾opment of fibrosis has implications for long term graft
function and survival [10, 11], a non-invasive reliable
method to monitor graft fibrosis may be clinically useful
during the follow-up of patients at risk, including HTx
recipients.
Histological evaluation of tissue is the gold standard
and has been the only available method for quantification of
myocardial fibrosis. However, its invasive nature and the ex￾posure to ionizing radiation during cardiac catheterization
represent significant barriers to serial endomyocardial
biopsies (EmBxs), especially in children. Furthermore,
the biopsied region may not be representative of the
majority of the myocardium and may be affected by
scarring due to previous sampling in the same location.
More recently, cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR)
techniques based on T1 relaxometry have been refined
and applied in adults with a variety of cardiac diseases, in￾cluding in HTx recipients [12–20]. CMR-derived markers
include native T1 times and extracellular volume fraction
(ECV), both of which have been validated histologically in
adults [16, 21–26], and both of which are predictive of
heart failure onset and mortality in adults with ischemic
and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy [27, 28]. However, nei￾ther native T1 nor ECV has been histologically validated
against EmBx in children and adolescents. We hypothe￾sized that native T1 and ECV are associated with the
histological degree of fibrosis within the myocardium of
pediatric HTx recipients.
The aims of this study in children after HTx were 1)
to compare CMR native T1 times and ECV with the de￾gree of fibrosis on histological samples and 2) to investi￾gate the association between the histological degree of
fibrosis and CMR-derived fibrosis markers on the one
hand and markers of cardiac health and transplant-related
factors on the other.
Methods
Study protocol and population
Following approval by the Hospital for Sick Children Re￾search Ethics Board (project # 1000013662), all HTx
children and adolescents who were scheduled for a clin￾ical EmBx for rejection surveillance in asymptomatic
patients between April 2010 and October 2011 were in￾vited to participate in the study. Following informed
written consent by the patients and/or their legal guard￾ian(s), patients underwent a research CMR immediately
prior to the catheterization with the EmBx procedure.
CMR studies were also performed in 24 controls, con￾sisting of children with a family history of arrhythmogenic
right ventricular cardiomyopathy or with non-specific
chest pain who were referred for anatomical coronary ar￾tery imaging. Only children who had an entirely normal
CMR examination as well as normal results on all other
tests were included.
Magnetic resonance image acquisition
The CMR examinations were performed using a 1.5 Tesla
system (‘Avanto’, Siemens Healthcare Sector, Erlangen,
Germany). Ventricular volumes were assessed with a stack
of multiphase short axis slices, acquired with a steady￾state free-procession (SSFP) sequence in the routine
clinical fashion [29]. A modified Look-Locker inversion
recovery (MOLLI) sequence was used to measure native
and postcontrast longitudinal relaxation T1 times of myo￾cardium and within the blood pool of the LV cavity as has
been described [30]. The sequence included two inversion￾recovery prepared, electrocardiogram synchronized Look￾Locker experiments with inversion pulses of 100 ms and
150 ms, respectively, with three and five single-shot images
after each of these inversion pulses. Other imaging pa￾rameters were as follows: Repetition and echo times
2.53 ms and 1.08 ms, respectively; in-plane resolution,
1.7 × 1.7 mm; slice thickness, 8 mm; flip angle, 35°.
Images were acquired in diastole at a single mid￾ventricular short axis slice before and 10 min after the ad￾ministration of 0.2 mmol/kg gadopentetate dimeglumine
(‘Magnevist’, Bayer, Leverkusen, Germany). Breathholds
were used in awake and cooperative patients; all other pa￾tients and anaesthetized patients were scanned during free
breathing or ventilation. The presence of late gadolinium
enhancement (LGE) was assessed qualitatively on long
and short-axis phase sensitive inversion recovery images
in the usual clinical fashion.
Magnetic resonance image analysis
T1 times and ECV
Longitudinal relaxation times (T1 times) were measured
using a curve-fitting algorithm within commercially avail￾able software (CVI42, Circle Cardiovascular Imaging,
Calgary, Canada). Regions of interest were drawn manu￾ally on the raw images of MOLLI mid-ventricular short
axis slices to represent the interventricular septum (IVS)
(equivalent to segments 8 and 9 of the American Heart
Association 17 segments left ventricular (LV) model [31])
and the entire LV myocardial circumference (representing
segments 7–12). To avoid partial volume effects at
Ide et al. Journal of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (2017) 19:10 Page 2 of 11

myocardial borders, regions of interest were confined
to the central two thirds of the myocardium, and were
manually adjusted on each raw image in order to compen￾sate for inter-image variability in diaphragm position
(Fig. 1). Pre- and postcontrast blood T1 times were mea￾sured in regions of interest manually drawn in the center
of the LV cavity so as to avoid trabeculations or papillary
muscles (Fig. 1). A second observer (LGW), who was
blinded towards the results by observer 1 (ER), measured
pre- and postcontrast T1 within the IVS and blood. Extra￾cellular volume fraction was calculated from pre- and
postcontrast T1 times for each region as well as the
hematocrit [15] which was obtained on the same day
according to the established formula [16].
Feature tracking
Feature tracking analysis was performed with the TomTec
2D CPA MR software (TomTec Imaging Systems,
Unterschleissheim, Germany) using standard SSFP cine
images, with 20 phases per cardiac cycle, as previously
described [32]. In brief, endocardial borders were
manually drawn in the end-diastolic frame, and then were
automatically propagated through the cardiac cycle. The
four-chamber view cines were tracked to derive global LV
longitudinal strain and strain rate, while short-axis cines
were used to derive global LV circumferential and radial
strain and strain rate in the same location as the T1 and
ECV measurements, i.e. at the level of the papillary mus￾cles of the LV.
Ventricular volumes and function
Ventricular volumes were obtained from the cine short
axis stack using dedicated software (QMass, version 7.2;
Medis, Leiden, The Netherlands) according to the Society
for Cardiovascular MR guidelines for reporting cardiovas￾cular MR examinations [33]. Ventricular volumes and LV
mass were indexed by body surface area and ejection
fractions were calculated from enddiastolic and endsys￾tolic ventricular volumes.
Histological analysis
Transvenous right ventricular biopsies were obtained
from the right ventricular aspect of the IVS immediately
following the CMR in the routine clinical fashion. Three
to six samples were taken in each individual. Samples
(100 in all) were immediately fixed in 10% buffered formalin,
processed and embedded in paraffin, and serially sec￾tioned, with every second slide stained with hematoxylin
Fig. 1 Quantification of T1 times. Regions of interest were drawn within the blood pool (yellow), the interventricular septum (orange), left ventricular
free wall (blue), entire left ventricular circumference (not shown) (panel a) and blood pool on each of the 8 source images (panel b), taken at different
inversion times. A curve fitting algorithm computed the T1 times for each region of interest (panel c)

and eosin as per standard protocol. A mid-level unstained
section was selected and stained with picrosirius red for
the analysis of collagen. Stained sections were digita￾lized with a Pannoramic 250 Flash IIslide scanner
(3DHISTECH, Budapest, Hungary). Low-power views
were was used to select appropriate areas for analysis,
excluding superficial endocardial fibrous tissue and
sites of scarring from previous biopsies at the discretion
of the interpreting pathologist (Fig. 2). Specimens were
photographed at ×20 magnification in all appropriate
myocardial regions.
The photographs were analyzed with automated image
analysis software (macro written in ‘Image J’, National In￾stitutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA), quantifying
the total area of stained collagen and that of myocardium,
excluding areas of white backgrounds in each sample
(Fig. 3). This method for the assessment of collagen
volume fraction (CVF) as a percent of the total tissue
sampled has been shown to correlate well with the de￾gree of fibrosis quantified by stereology and polarized light
microscopy [34]. Collagen volume fraction was averaged
among all biopsy specimens from each individual.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using JMP pro version
11 software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina,
USA). Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation or
median with range, as appropriate; categorical variables
are reported as number and percentage. Paired compar￾isons were performed by using Student t test or the
Mann-Whitney U test for non-normally distributed
data between patients and controls, and between groups
of patients, where applicable. Linear regression analysis
was performed by using the Pearson correlation coeffi￾cient for normally distributed data. Correlations were ana￾lyzed with use of Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient
test for non-normally distributed data. Interobserver vari￾ability for native T1 times and ECV were assessed using
the Bland-Altman method. All p values are two sided.
Statistical significance was defined as p ≦ 0.05.
Results
Patient population
Patient characteristics are summarized in Table 1.
Twenty patients (45% female) who had undergone HTx
at a median age of 8.6 years (range, 0.02–16 years), and 24
controls were enrolled. Some of the results in a subgroup
of patients were reported previously as part of a different
study, exploring the association between CMR-derived fi￾brosis markers and cardiac function by echocardiography
[17]. Patients were younger at the time of CMR than con￾trols (p < 0.05). However, the organ age which was calcu￾lated as the sum of the donor age at demise and the time
since HTx, was similar between the two groups. (Table 1)
In terms of immunosuppressive medication, at the time of
the CMR, 16 patients received tacrolimus and mycophe￾nolate mofetil, two tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil
in addition to prednisone, one tacrolimus monotherapy,
and one sirolimus with mycophenolate mofetil. Three pa￾tients had previously taken Cyclosporine. Other medica￾tions included statins (n = 10) and amlodipine for arterial
hypertension (n = 6). No patients were treated for diabetes
mellitus. No patient had coronary angiography performed
within 6 months of CMR.
Imaging markers of fibrosis and histological validation
Myocardial biopsy was collected without complication in
all subjects. The mean histological CVF in all patients
was 10 ± 3.4% (Fig. 4). The average CVF in all 100 biop￾sied specimens are shown in Additional file 1. MOLLI
was acquired during breathholding in six patients (30%).
Native T1 times and ECV were higher in HTx patients
compared to controls within the IVS (p < 0.005 and p <
0.0001, respectively, Table 2) (Fig. 5a). Patients also had
higher ECV values in the entire LV myocardium as com￾pared to controls (p < 0.0001, Table 2, Fig. 5b). Histo￾logical CVF showed a moderate correlation with native

T1 times as well as ECV within the IVS (r = 0.53, p < 0.05
and r = 0.46, p < 0.05, respectively, Fig. 6). There was no
significant association between CVF and native T1 times
or ECV within entire LV. Neither patients nor controls
presented with evidence of focal scarring by LGE.
Interobserver variability
Bland-Altman plots, along with mean bias, coefficient of
variation, standard deviation and limits of agreement of
interobserver variability for native T1 times and ECV in
the IVS are shown in Fig. 7.
Association between histological and CMR-derived fibrosis
markers and clinical parameters
No correlation existed between CVF and heart age at
the time of CMR or between either native T1 values or
ECV and heart age. At the time of CMR, no patient had
clinically significant rejection as per EmBx on the same
day (ISHLT grade 0 R; n = 9; grade 1 R; n = 11). Seven
patients (35%) had had at least one previous episode of
acute cellular rejection (ACR) with an ISHLT grade ≥ 2
R. No differences in CVF, native T1 time, or ECV were
identified between patients with and without previous 2
R ACR (p = 0.78). One patient had experienced an episode
of antibody-mediated rejection 2.8 years after transplant￾ation and 2.2 years before CMR, requiring extracorporeal
membrane oxygenation and intensification of immuno￾suppression. This patient had the second highest CVF
of all patients with 15.2% and highest native T1 time
with 1070 ms, both in the IVS.
The authors’ center routinely performs ABO incom￾patible HTx in infants and young children. Five patients
out of the eight patients who had undergone HTx before
their second birthday had donor/recipient ABO incom￾patibility. No differences in CVF, native T1 time, or ECV
were observed between patients with and without ABO
miss-match.
No correlation existed between organ ischemia time
at the time of HTx and CVF. Native T1 time, but not
ECV, in the IVS correlated with ischemia time (r = 0.46,
p < 0.05).
The six patients on antihypertensive medications did
not have different CVF, native T1 or ECV in any of the
investigated regions (IVS and entire LV) as compared to
normotensive patients (p = 0.12 for CVF, p = 0.63 for
native T1 in IVS, p = 0.51 for native T1 in entire LV,
p = 0.98 for ECV in IVS, and p = 0.91 for ECV in entire
LV respectively). No significant difference existed in LV
mass between patients with and without antihypertensive
medications (69 ± 18 g/m2 vs 63 ± 4 g/m2
, p = 0.43).
Four patients underwent CMR within the first 90 days
after HTx (median duration, 23 days; range, 9–51 days).
The ‘early’ group did have higher ECV in the IVS and
the entire LV, while CVF was not different in these 4 pa￾tients as compared to the other HTx patients who were
investigated at least three months after HTx. (Table 3).

No correlation was observed between N-terminal-pro￾brain-natriuretic peptide and CVF, native T1 or ECV in
the patient group.
Coronary angiography was not performed in close
proximity to CMR and EmBx for ethical reasons. How￾ever, 15 patients underwent coronary angiography after
CMR (median duration, 3.0 years; range 1.0– 4.6 years).
One patient had ISHLT grade 1 CAV 1 year after CMR
and deceased 1.5 years after coronary angiography. An￾other patient demonstrated ISHLT grade 2 CAV three
years after CMR. The remaining 13 patients had normal
coronaries at the time of coronary angiography.
Relationship of CMR myocardial strain with histological
and CMR-derived fibrosis markers
Global LV radial strain and strain rate were higher in
HTx patients compared to controls (p < 0.0001 and p <
0.0005, respectively, Table 2). No differences in global
LV longitudinal and circumferential strain and strain rate
were identified between patients and controls. (Table 2)
No association existed in the patients between any of the
global strains or strain rates and CVF, native T1 or ECV
measured within the entire LV and IVS.
Relationship of ventricular size and function with
histological and CMR-derived fibrosis markers
The results of ventricular size, mass, and ejection fraction
analysis are summarized in Table 2. Patients after HTx
had higher LV mass and LV mass-to-volume ratio as
compared to controls. (Table 2) Thirteen patients dem￾onstrated an LV ejection fraction below 55%, albeit under
general anaesthesia. Eight patients had a right ventricular
(RV) ejection fraction below 45%. No difference existed in
CVF, native T1 times and ECV between patients with and
without reduced CMR LV or RV ejection fraction. Left

ventricular mass, as well as the ratio of LV mass to end￾diastolic volume, showed no correlation with CVF, native
T1 time or ECV. During a follow-up period of 7.8 ±
2.9 years, no patient underwent re-HTx and three patients
died. One of them, who died from post-transplant lym￾phoproliferative disorder, was also the only one who had
suffered from severe antibody-mediated rejection before
CMR with the second highest CVF and highest septal na￾tive T1 time. The remaining two patients who’s CVF, na￾tive T1 time and ECV were below the cohort mean died
from rejection or renal failure.
Discussion
Despite a variety of candidate etiologies the morpho￾logical substrate for graft dysfunction following HTx is
incompletely understood. Adverse fibrotic myocardial
remodeling is a suspected longterm sequelae of HTx.
However, until recently, it has not been feasible to quan￾tify myocardial fibrosis non-invasively. The present study
adds the following to our understanding of myocardial
health in paediatric patients after HTx:
1.) Native T1 time and ECV in the IVS correlate with
histological degree of fibrosis in EmBx specimens.
2.) Septal native T1 times are higher in patients with
longer ischemia times at the time of transplantation.
Both ECV and native T1 times have been validated
against the histological gold standard in adults with valvu￾lar heart disease, as well as ischemic and non-ischemic
cardiomyopathy [16, 21, 23–25]. This is the first histo￾logical validation of markers of diffuse myocardial

patients compared to controls in interventricular septum (IVS). The patient group showed significantly higher native T1 times in the IVS than in

fibrosis by CMR relaxometry in children and the first
study to validate ECV and T1 against CVF by RV sep￾tal EmBx in any age group. The correlations between
histological CVF and native T1 times as well as ECV
were modest. The level of agreement is in keeping
with a study of postcontrast T1 vs. CVF in adult heart
failure patients who underwent RV septal EmBx [22].
Studies in adults with myocardial biopsies from the
LV, either by EmBx [26], intraoperative deep myocar￾dial needle biopsy [21, 23, 25], surgical sampling [16] or
analysis of the entire heart at the time of death or retrans￾plantation [24], showed better agreement between CMR
and histology than for the RV. The weaker agreement
between RV tissue and LV T1 times and ECV is not
surprising as there may be differences between RV and LV
fibrosis and an RV septal sample may not be representa￾tive of LV myocardium [35]. In fact, one of the few studies
which quantified ECV in congenital heart disease found
higher RV than LV ECV in the same individual [36]. Some
experts argue that findings on EmBx, right or left,
may not be a representative of fibrotic changes found
‘deep’ within the allograft of end-stage post-transplant
paediatric patients [6]. There are other potential explana￾tions for the sub-optimal correlation between EmBx and
CMR in our study and the one by Sibley and colleagues
[22]: Although we strove to exclude all previous biopsy
sites from analysis there remains the possibility that scar￾ring from earlier procedures may have affected CVF quan￾tification. Furthermore, the small size of the EmBx
specimens may have served to reduce their representative
value for the entire myocardium, despite our attempts to
limit the effects of the small tissue size: CVF was assessed
across each entire specimen, using automated quantifica￾tion systems and uniform magnification, in contrast to
earlier studies [16, 21, 23, 24]. It is interesting to note that
native T1 times and ECV showed moderate correlation
with CVF only in the IVS, but not for the entire LV.
This may suggest that a) EmBx from the RV aspect
of the interventricular septum are more reflective of
the IVS than other parts of the LV, and that b) there is
heterogeneity with regards to the degree of fibrotic re￾modeling throughout the LV. In fact, previous studies
showed substantial segmental variation in T1 values and
ECV [24, 37, 38]. It must be remembered that both
T1 and ECV by CMR are only approximations of ‘fi￾brosis’ amounts and that both are affected by other myo￾cardial processes, including edema.
In the present study as in other validation studies,
ECV measured by CMR was higher than the histological
CVF. Picrosirius red stains collagens which are the most
abundant macromolecules in extracellular matrix. On
the other hand, ECV depends on the uptake of gadolin￾ium in the entire extracellular space. As such, it is a
marker for the relative size of the extracellular matrix
which contains other proteins like elastin, adhesive gly￾coproteins and proteoglycans in addition to collagen, as
well as vascular volumes. As a result, although there is
an association between the two ECV exceeds CVF. The
average ECV in our paediatric controls was 0.22 ± 0.03,
as compared to 0.25 ± 0.04 in adults [39]. These levels

are in in keeping with in vivo studies using extracellular
markers including 14C inulin or 14C mannitol in a rat
model [40].
We demonstrated that ECV was significantly higher in
patients early after HTx as compared to remaining pa￾tients. Exposure to cardiopulmonary bypass, reperfusion
injury of the organ and other perioperative factors as
well as possible episodes of early ACR are all factors
which potentially promote myocardial edema as well as
fibrotic remodeling [41].
Fibrosis within cardiac allografts is a well-documented
phenomenon in adults [42, 43]. The results of increased
septal native T1 time and ECV in children after HTx as
compared to controls suggests that the same is true for
paediatric patients. In a study evaluating serial EmBxs in
50 post-transplant adult patients, Armstrong et al. [43]
showed that myocardial fibrosis develops as early as two
months after transplant. Gramley et al. observed that fi￾brotic bundles form soon after HTx [44]. These two
studies indicate that peri-transplant factors play a role in
initiating a profibrotic cascade. Inflammation, recurrent
episodes of rejection, metabolic disturbances and CAV
[45] have all been proposed as promotors of adverse
fibrotic remodeling. In the current study, septal T1
times were associated with longer graft ischemia times
suggesting that minimizing them may lead to improved
graft health [4, 46]. This association is in keeping with a
correlation of cardiopulmonary bypass and aortic cross￾clamp times with ECV in patients after Tetralogy of Fallot
repair [47]. Larger prospective studies with a longitudinal
component are necessary to answer the prognostic value
of ECV and native T1.
We did not observe a relationship between LV or RV
ejection fraction and histological or CMR markers of fi￾brosis, however, ejection fraction is a relatively insensi￾tive marker of a decline in myocardial function [48].
Children and adolescents after HTx had reduced global
radial strain and strain rate as compared to controls
using CMR. The reduction in longitudinal strain in HTx
patients was not significant. Of note, images for longitu￾dinal strain analysis were available in only 9 controls,
limiting the power of this comparison. This finding cor￾roborates a report by Eleid et al. [49] who found reduced
radial strain by speckle tracking in adult HTx patients
irrespective of rejection. Similarly, Kailin and colleagues,
also by speckle tracking [50], reported abnormal longitu￾dinal, but not circumferential strain in paediatric HTx
patients. Their study did not investigate radial strain.
There was no association with CMR and histological
myocardial fibrosis markers and strain or strain rate in
the present study.
Bland-Altman analyses revealed only a small bias but
relatively wide limits of agreements between the two
observers. Breathholds were used for the MOLLI
acquisition in 30% of patients, and a motion correction
algorithm was not available at the time of data acquisi￾tion. In fact, Fig. 7 demonstrates that agreement was
better for patients who were scanned during with
breathholds, particularly for native T1.
Limitations
First, the modest sample size of this pilot study may
have obscured further differences between controls and
patients as well as associations between fibrosis markers
and other parameters. Second, T1 and ECV were measured
on a single short axis slice and the assumption that these
values are representative of the LV myocardium from base
to apex may be erroneous. Third, it is possible that the dif￾ference in T1 and ECV between patients and controls was
amplified by the lower hematocrit levels in HTx recipients,
given the linear relationship between lower hematocrit
and higher T1 and due to the fact that all myocardial
regions of interest also sample small volumes of
blood within the intramyocardial capillaries. However,
if hematocrit, and not expansion of the extracellular
space, was the primary determinant of T1, one would
expect a correlation between hematocrit and native
myocardial T1. No association between T1 and hematocrit
was present, in the patient cohort. Furthermore, when
comparing patients in the highest T1 quartile with those
in the lowest T1 quartile we did not see a difference
in hematocrit. Therefore, we do not believe that the
differences in T1 and ECV are entirely or mainly due to
variations in hematocrit. Finally, coronary angiography
was not available in close proximity to CMR and EmBx
for ethical reasons. Therefore, CAV, one of the candidate
etiologies of fibrotic myocardial remodeling, could not be
investigated.
Conclusion
Native T1 time and ECV correlate with histologically
determined collagen volume in paediatric patients after
HTx. The graft organs in children after HTx undergo
accelerated myocardial fibrotic remodeling, and higher
native T1 times are associated with longer ischemia times.
