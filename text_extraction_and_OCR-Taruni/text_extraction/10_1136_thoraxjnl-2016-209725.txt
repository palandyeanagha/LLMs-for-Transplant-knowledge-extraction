Abstract
Treatment of acute emergencies in patients with pulmonary arterial
hypertension (PAH) can be challenging. In the UK and Ireland,
management of adult patients with PAH is centred in eight
nationally designated pulmonary hypertension (PH) centres.
However, many patients live far from these centres and physicians
in local hospitals are often required to manage PAH emergencies. A
committee of physicians from nationally designated PH centres
identified the ‘most common’ emergency clinical scenarios
encountered in patients with PAH. Thereafter, a review of the
literature was performed centred on these specified topics and a
management approach was developed based on best available
evidence and expert consensus. Management protocols were
developed on the following PAH emergencies: chest pain (including
myocardial ischaemia), right ventricular failure, arrhythmias,
sepsis, haemoptysis (‘CRASH'), as well as considerations relevant to
surgery, anaesthesia and pregnancy. Emergencies are not
uncommon in PAH. While expertise in PAH management is
essential, all physicians involved in acute care should be aware of
the principles of acute management of PAH emergencies. A
multidisciplinary approach is necessary, with physicians from
tertiary PH centres supporting care locally and planning safe
transfer of patients to PH centres when appropriate.
