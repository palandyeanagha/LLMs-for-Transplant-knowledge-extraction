Renal function in patients over 40 with homozygous
sickle-cell disease
A G MORGAN, G R SERJEANT
Abstract
Renal function was examined in 25 patients aged 40-64
with homozygous sickle-cell (SS) disease. Investigations
included intravenous urography and measurement of
blood urea and creatffine concentrations and creatinine
and protein excretion in 24-hour collections of urine.
Serum creatinine concentrations did not differ sig￾nificantly from those of 25 other patients with SS disease
aged 18-39 years, but serum urea concentrations were
significantly higher (p <0 001). Intravenous urography
showed loss of caliceal cupping (nine patients), irregular
renal outline (five), and cystic extension from the calix
(one). Six patients had creatinine clearances below the
fifth percentile for age and sex. Proteinuria was more
common in these patients, and haemoglobin concentra￾tions were much lower than in the 19 patients without
renal insufficiency (mean 5-6 v 8-2 g/dl; p <0 001).
Haemoglobin concentration was strongly correlated
with creatinine clearance (r-0170), particularly with
clearances below 100 ml/min/1 73 m2 (r =- 0-96; p <0 001).
A possible mechanism of renal insufficiency in SS
disease is cortical scarring, which is asymptomatic, not
associated with hypertension, and accompanied by
only minor proteinuria. A falling haemoglobin con￾centration is a sensitive and early indicator of renal
impairment in SS disease.

disease' but glomerular function is usually well maintained. In
children and young adults glomerular filtration rates exceed
normal2 but may fall at later ages.3 The contribution of deterior￾ating glomerular function to morbidity and mortality in older
patients with SS disease4 is not widely recognised. It is a
clinical impression that renal failure is common in such patients
in Jamaica, and a necropsy survey of the University Hospital
of the West Indies indicated that renal failure contributed to
or caused death in 11 out of 49 (22%) patients aged over 30 years
(unpublished observations). We report renal function in 25
unselected patients aged 40 years or over.
Patients and methods
Among patients attending the sickle-cell clinic of the University
Hospital of the West Indies in a six-month period there were 25
(12 men, 13 women) aged 40-64 years who consented to this study.
The diagnosis of SS disease was based on a single major haemoglobin
(Hb) band in the position of HbS on cellulose acetate and agar-gel
electrophoresis, compatible HbA2 concentrations, and family study
where possible. All patients were admitted to a metabolic ward for
four days, and none had been given a blood transfusion in the pre￾ceding four months.
Routine haematological procedures were used. Other investigations
included intravenous urography after overnight fluid restriction,
bacteriological examination of midstream urine, measurement of
blood electrolyte, urea, and creatinine concentrations, and two
24-hour urine collections for creatinine and protein excretion. The
mean of two determinations of creatinine clearance was corrected
for surface area derived from height and weight. Routine parametric
statistical procedures were used, and the skewed distributions of
serum urea and creatinine were corrected by log transformation
before further analysis.
Results
CLINICAL
Twenty-four patients denied acute symptoms, though 16 had
mild breathlessness on exertion. One 64-year-old woman with
known renal failure had severe effort dyspnoea intermittently relieved
by transfusion. Other clinical features were compatible with SS

disease. All patients took analgesics (usually paracetamol) but none
exceeded 10 tablets monthly.
Physical examination showed cardiomegaly in all cases; ejection
systolic murmurs were common, and the jugular venous pulse was
raised in two. No patient was hypertensive, and blood pressure was
generally low for age (mean 117 ± SD 9 mm Hg systolic, 65 ±7 mm Hg
diastolic). In no patient were the kidneys palpable.
HABMATOLOGICAL
Haemoglobin values (range 4-3 to 11 4 g/dl) showed a weak
negative correlation with age (r = - 0-41; p < 0 05) and no significant
sex difference. Reticulocyte counts (range 3-8% to 20 5%) showed
no significant relation with age and sex.
RENAL STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION
Mean kidney length was 12-3 cm (range 10-1 to 14-8 cm), or 7-5%
(range 6-3% to 9 2%) of standing height, and correlated with
creatinine clearance when corrected for surface area (r=0-61; p<
0-001). Morphological abnormalities included loss of caliceal cupping
in nine patients and irregularities of the renal outline in five. One
patient had a cystic extension from one calix, but no other features
of papillary necrosis occurred and no patient had any features of
lower urinary tract obstruction. Midstream urine cultures were
sterile in all cases and no excess of pus cells was found.
Serum creatinine concentration exceeded the upper normal limit
(124 ianol/l; 1-4 mg/100 ml) in three patients, and serum urea
exceeded the upper normal limit (5 5 mmol/l; 33 mg/100 ml) in

seven. Serum urea concentrations were higher than those of a group
of 25 randomly selected patients with SS disease aged 18-39 years
(geometric mean 5-5 v 2-9 mmol/l (33-1 v 17-5 mg/100 ml); p < 0 001)
but there was no significant difference in serum creatinine values.
Creatinine clearance varied widely (mean 116 ml/min/1-73 M2;
range 11-204 ml/min/1-73 m2) and was below 80 ml/min/1-73 M2 in
six patients, who were considered on this basis to have renal in￾sufficiency. In all six creatinine clearance was below the fifth per￾centile for age and sex in a normal population.5 Comparison of these
patients with the rest of the group failed to disclose differences in
age, clinical features, blood pressure, symptoms of renal failure, or
reticulocyte count, though differences were apparent in proteinuria,
haemoglobin concentration, and findings on intravenous urography.
Proteinuria greater than 100 mg/day was more common in renal
insufficiency (p = 0 04), but only one patient lost over 1 g/day.
Haemoglobin values were significantly lower in the group with
renal insufficiency (mean 5 6 ± SD 1 1 g/dl v 8-2 ±1-2 g/dl; p < 0 001),
and there was a strong positive correlation between the haemoglobin
concentration and creatinine clearance (r=0070; p<0001; fig 1),
which was particularly striking in patients with creatinine clearance
below 100 ml/min/1-73 m2 (r=0-96; p<0001). Renal insufficiency
was significantly associated with irregularity of the renal outline in
the intravenous urogram (p=00008) but not with caliceal clubbing

(p = 0 09). Though ages of patients with and without renal insufficiency
were not significantly different, there was a negative correlation
between creatinine clearance and age in the entire group, but this
was weak (r= -047; p<0-05; fig 2).

Discussion
This study shows that high glomerular filtration rates,
which are uniform in young patients with SS disease,2 may
persist into adult life in some patients but not in others. Con￾trary to the gradually falling glomerular filtration rate observed
with age in the normal population,' there was only a weak
negative correlation with age, and two patients over 60 had
creatinine clearances of 120 ml/min/1-73 m2 or more. On the
other hand, six of the 25 unselected patients with SS disease
had creatinine clearances below the expected fifth percentile
for age and sex, supporting the suggestion that renal failure is
an important factor in mortality.' The mechanism for this
reduction in glomerular function is not clear. Younger adults
with SS disease may be susceptible to the nephrotic syndrome
complicated by uraemia,6 but since none of our patients had
been nephrotic or had heavy proteinuria it seems unlikely that
the glomerular disorder associated with this syndrome7 could
have been responsible for renal insufficiency. Published work
on the histological structure of the kidney in SS disease does
not include patients of the age we studied, but we assume that
if the interstitial and minor glomerular changes described in
younger adults with normal glomerular function" became more
pronounced reduction of glomerular function might result.
Alternatively a third pattern of damage, cortical scarring,
which has been recorded in sickle haemoglobin C disease,9
might also produce renal failure. Necropsy in one patient in
our study, who died in renal failure (creatinine clearance
28 ml/min/1 73 m2), showed small kidneys with areas of cortical
atrophy surrounding islands of preserved parenchyma in a
pattern corresponding to the irregularity of renal outline seen
on intravenous urography. The association of this radiological
abnormality with renal insufficiency and its tendency to be
more common in older patients10 suggest that this patchy
process may be responsible for reduction of creatinine clearance.
Whatever the process causing renal insufficiency it is clinically
asymptomatic, without hypertension, associated with minor
proteinuria, and generally signalled only by a falling haemo￾globin concentration.
The correlation between haemoglobin value and creatinine
clearance was striking. Anaemia alone is not associated with a
significant reduction in glomerular filtration,11 and it seems likely
that renal insufficiency caused the falling haemoglobin con￾centration since this occurs in patients with SS disease and
obstructive uropathy (unpublished observations) and in normal
people with renal insufficiency. Anaemia in renal insufficiency
in patients without SS disease, however, does not usually occur

until creatinine clearance12 falls below 60 ml/min/173 m2 or
the serum urea concentration13 exceeds 8-3 mmol/l (50 mg/
100 ml), whereas haemoglobin concentrations fall in SS disease
with higher clearances and occasionally normal urea values. One
explanation for this difference would be that the greatly ex￾panded erythron in SS disease is very dependent on erythro￾poietin and readily reflects reduced production associated with
mild renal disease.
The results show that a fall in steady-state haemoglobin
concentration is a sensitive and early indicator of renal im￾pairment. The high prevalance of renal insufficiency in older
patients with SS disease suggests that renal function and
haemoglobin values should be monitored carefully.

Rapid improvement in abnormal pulmonary epithelial
permeability after stopping cigarettes
BARBARA D MINTY, C JORDAN, J G JONES
Abstract
A new, non-invasive method of measuring pulmonary
epithelial damage in man was compared with traditional
tests of small-airway function. Pulmonary epithelial
permeability was expressed as the half-time clearance
from the lung into blood of 99mTc-diethylene triamine￾penta-acetic acid (9mTc-DTPA) deposited predominantly
in the alveoli from an inhaled aerosol.
Recovery from abnormal pulmonary permeability
was recorded after stopping smoking for 21 days in a
group of young symptomless cigarette smokers. Before
stopping smoking there was a significant correlation
between half-time lung clearance of 99mTc-DTPA and
carboxyhaemoglobin concentration (r=0 69; p <005).
There was no correlation between carboxyhaemoglobin
value and closing volume, the only other abnormal test
of airway function. Twenty-four hours after stopping
smoking the mean half-time lung clearance of 9mTc￾DTPA had increased significantly (p <0 001) from a
baseline of 15 8 min (SEM 1 3 min) to 25 5 min (SEM
2 5 min). The mean half-time clearance continued to
increase to a maximum of 35 5 min (SEM 3-1 min) at
seven days, but was significantly less than the reported
half-time clearance for non-smokers (59 min, SEM

5 min). There was no significant change in half-time
clearance in six subjects who continued to smoke over a
similar period. For individuals the greater the perme￾ability the smaller was the recovery in the non-smoking
period. There were no significant changes in results of
any other tests of small-airway function.
This index of pulmonary permeability is a very sen￾sitive test of damage to lung epithelium caused by
smoking. It shows both severity and recovery of function,
which are not detectable by conventional tests.
Introduction
We recently described a new test of pulmonary function which
is used to derive an index of altered permeability of the
pulmonary epithelium to the chelate 99mTc-diethylene triamine￾penta-acetic acid (99mTc-DTPA).l We assumed that the
permeability of the walls of small airways and alveoli is the
major determinant of this index because an aerosol of 99mTc￾DTPA, particle size 1 ,um, will deposit predominantly in the
alveolated airways.2 During the development of this technique
we noticed that a group of symptomless cigarette smokers had
a significantly greater permeability than non-smokers. One of
these subjects with increased permeability gave up smoking
and we observed a reduction of the permeability defect." We
designed the present study to investigate in more detail the
relation between cigarette smoking and pulmonary epithelial
permeability, and to examine the time course and degree of
reduction in permeability after stopping cigarette smoking. We
compared the changes in permeability after stopping smoking
with the results of sequential measurements of small-airway
function using traditional tests and a new test developed in our
laboratory.4
