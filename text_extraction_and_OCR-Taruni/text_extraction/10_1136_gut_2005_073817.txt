Background and aim: A role for the intestinal microbial community (microbiota) in the onset and
chronicity of Crohn’s disease (CD) is strongly suspected. However, investigation of such a complex
ecosystem is difficult, even with culture independent molecular approaches.
Methods: We used, for the first time, a comprehensive metagenomic approach to investigate the full range
of intestinal microbial diversity. We used a fosmid vector to construct two libraries of genomic DNA
isolated directly from faecal samples of six healthy donors and six patients with CD. Bacterial diversity was
analysed by screening the two DNA libraries, each composed of 25 000 clones, for the 16S rRNA gene
by DNA hybridisation.
Results: Among 1190 selected clones, we identified 125 non-redundant ribotypes mainly represented by
the phyla Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes. Among the Firmicutes, 43 distinct ribotypes were identified in the
healthy microbiota, compared with only 13 in CD (p,0.025). Fluorescent in situ hybridisation directly
targeting 16S rRNA in faecal samples analysed individually (n = 12) confirmed the significant reduction in
the proportion of bacteria belonging to this phylum in CD patients (p,0.02).
Conclusion: The metagenomic approach allowed us to detect a reduced complexity of the bacterial phylum
Firmicutes as a signature of the faecal microbiota in patients with CD. It also indicated the presence of new
bacterial species.
Under certain circumstances, the indigenous gut
microbes will be determinant in the onset and
maintenance of inflammatory bowel disease, especially
Crohn’s disease (CD), to which genetic susceptibility and
disorders in mucosal immunity could also be implicated.1
Mutations in the CARD15/NOD2 gene have been associated
with a higher risk of CD.2 Similarly, dysbiosis has recently
been coined as a trait linked to CD.3
As most intestinal commensals cannot be cultured,4 5
genomic strategies have therefore been developed to over￾come this limitation. Using classical techniques, such as
temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis6 and single
strand conformation polymorphism,7 a few studies have
shown alteration in the diversity of the microbiota in CD but
the precise microbial species or metabolites involved remain
unknown.
The metagenomic approach, in which the microbial
community is studied as a single dynamic entity, has been
used to investigate complex environments such as water and
soil,8 9 but has not yet been applied to the human intestinal
microbiota. In metagenomics, microbial genomes are frag￾mented and cloned in order to obtain a single library
representing the microbiome (genomes of a complex com￾munity). Whereas former researches focused on comparisons
of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) derived 16S rDNA
libraries, metagenomic libraries similarly permit comparison
of species diversity based on a PCR independent approach but
also a complete description of genes based on genomic
sequence analysis and thereby a full description of function￾alities of the whole ecosystem.
Here we present the first metagenomic approach to
investigate the faecal bacterial composition in CD. We
isolated genomic DNA directly from faecal samples of six
healthy donors and six CD patients, and used the pooled DNA
to construct one library for each group of subjects. The
libraries were then screened for 16S rRNA genes by DNA
hybridisation, and microbial diversity was determined by 16S
rRNA gene sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. The
metagenomic results were confirmed by using a fluorescent
in situ hybridisation (FISH) method applied to individual
faecal samples from the same subjects.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Methodology
We extracted genomic DNA from faecal samples of six
healthy individuals and six patients with CD. We used the
pooled DNA to construct two metagenomic libraries for each
group of subjects. Each library contained 25 000 clones. Two
macroarrays were built after fosmid extraction and DNA
spotting on nylon membranes for each library. In order to
analyse microbial diversity, 16S rRNA genes were screened by
DNA hybridisation and sequenced, and phylogenetic analysis
was performed (fig 1).
Patients and samples
None of the patients or healthy subjects had received
antibiotics for at least three months before sampling. The
six patients with CD were five women and one man, aged 18–
44 years. Patients were in remission (with a CD activity index
,150). All had ileal disease; four patients had associated
lesions in the duodenum, caecum, left colon, and anus (one
case for each associated lesion). Two patients received no
treatment at the time of sampling; two received 5-ASA (2 or
3 g/day) and two received azathioprine (150 mg/day). The six
healthy volunteers were one woman and five men, aged 29–
43 years.

Faecal samples were collected from the 12 subjects and
were processed in less than three hours in order to preserve
strictly anaerobic bacteria from oxygen. Bacterial cells were
recovered by Nycodenz density gradient centrifugation10 and
then washed twice with phosphate buffered saline (10 min￾utes at 8000 g). Cell pellets were then incorporated in agarose
before gentle bacterial lysis10 and DNA digestion by the
enzyme Sau 3AI.

Library construction
High molecular weight bacterial DNA fragments (38–48 kbp)
were isolated as previously described.10 Metagenomic DNA
was then cloned into fosmid, a bacterially propagated
phagemid vector system suitable for cloning genomic inserts
approximately 40 kilobases in size, using the EpiFos library
production kit (Epicentre Technologies, Madison, Wisconsin,
USA), as recommended by the manufacturer (fig 1).
Macroarray preparation
Screening for 16S rRNA genes in the fosmid libraries involved
extraction of the recombinant fosmids in order to remove the
16S rRNA gene of Escherichia coli used in the cloning system.
Extraction was performed with a NucleoSpin 96 Flash kit, as
recommended by the manufacturer (Macherey-Nagel,
Hoerdt, France). Between 2 and 4 ng of each extracted
fosmid was spotted on nylon membranes measuring
22622 cm (Amersham Biosciences, Orsay, France) in a 565
format, using the Qbot robot (Genetix, Saint-Marcel,
France); approximately 50 000 spots can be deposited on
each membrane.
Macroarray probe preparation
In order to screen for 16S rRNA genes using the most
universal probe, we used whole DNA directly extracted from
faecal samples12 as a template to generate a mixed probe by
PCR amplification. Primers used for amplification (ACM 008
F and EUB 338; table 1) generated PCR products of
approximately 330 bp in length, representative of the
diversity of the original ecosystem. Faecal samples were
collected from the six healthy individuals used to construct
the metagenomic library, and from two other healthy
individuals. PCR was run with a Peltier PTC-100TM
Thermal Cycler (MJ ResearchTM, Inc., Massachusetts, USA)
at 94˚C for 10 minutes, nine cycles: 92˚C for one minute; 58˚C
for one minute; 72˚C for one minute; and 72˚C for
10 minutes. Forward and reverse primers were ACM 008 F
and EUB 338, respectively (table 1). Concentrations of PCR
products were evaluated on the basis of band intensities after
gel electrophoresis. PCR products (30 ng) were labelled with
[a￾33P]dATP using the Megaprime DNA labelling System
(Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden).
Macroarray hybridisation
The spotted membranes were first incubated in prehybridisa￾tion solution (66 saline sodium citrate (SSC), 1% sodium
dodecyl sulphate (SDS), 106 Denhardt, 50% formamide) at
42˚C for two hours. Then, a 33P-labelled probe (106 cpm/ml)
and sonicated salmon sperm DNA (100 mg/ml, denatured for
10 minutes at 100˚C) were added to the prehybridisation
solution and incubation was continued at 42˚C overnight.
After hybridisation membranes were washed once in 26SSC,
0.1% SDS at 42˚C for 10 minutes, once in 26SSC, 0.1% SDS
Figure 1 Construction and screening of metagnomic libraries. Bacterial cells were recovered by Nycodenz density gradient centrifugation from faecal
samples of six healthy subjects and six patients with Crohn’s disease in remission. High molecular weight bacterial DNA fragments (38–48 kbp) were
isolated. Metagenomic DNA was then cloned into fosmids. Screening for 16S rRNA genes in the fosmid libraries was performed by DNA hybridisation
on membrane nylon. All sequences were determined using four primers (ACM 008 F, ADM 330 F, SSM 1100 R, and TTM 1517 R) specific for bacteria
(table 1). Assembled sequences covering approximately positions 200–1300 were selected for subsequent phylogenetic analysis. For each library,
sequences were aligned using the ClustalW v1.83 program. Distance matrices were computed with DNADIST v3.6 and trees were constructed with
NEIGHBOR v3.6.

for 10 minutes, and once in 0.16 SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65˚C for

with the Molecular Dynamics Storm system and analysed
with Xdigitise software (http://www.molgen.mpg.de/,xdigi￾tise/).
Sequences
All sequences were determined by Genoscope (Evry, France)
on an ABI 3730 DNA sequencer using four primers (ACM 008
F, ADM 330 F, SSM 1100 R, and TTM 1517 R) specific for
bacteria (table 1). The 16S rRNA gene was sequenced in four
fragments which were then quality controlled using the
PHRED v0.020425.c program and assembled with the PHRAP
v0.990319 program. Assembled sequences covering approxi￾mately positions 200–1300 were selected for subsequent
analysis. For each library, sequences were aligned using the
ClustalW v1.83 program.13 Highly variable regions of the
multiple alignment were removed, and conserved regions
were selected with Gblocks,14 using parameters optimised for
rRNA alignments.15 The use of this computerised method
avoids the manual refinement of multiple alignments.
Distance matrices were computed with DNADIST v3.616 and
trees were constructed with NEIGHBOR v3.6.17 Unrooted
trees were drawn with Treeview.18 We defined an operational
taxonomic unit (OTU) as a cluster of 16S rDNA sequences
sharing at least 98% similarity.19 A single representative
faecal clone was selected for each OTU or ribotype. This clone
was used as a reference sequence for calculating phylogenetic
distances from other aligned sequences. Chimeric sequences
were checked using the RDP CHECK_CHIMERA program
(RDP-II release 8.1). The stability of branches was assessed
by the bootstrap method with 1000 replicates. The term
‘‘uncultured OTUs’’ refers to species recovered by molecular
methods only. Unidentified species (or totally novel species)
correspond to microorganisms that match no available
sequences in public databases (NCBI and RDP-II release
9).20 We used phylum and group level nomenclatures, as
defined in Berguey’s Manual of Systematic Bacteriology (second
edition) and the RDP Naive Bayesian classifier, respectively.
The representative nature of our libraries was estimated using
Good’s coverage formula.21
Good’s coverage was calculated as [12(n/N)]6100, where
n is the number of single clone OTU and N is the total
number of sequences for the analysed sample.
Fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH)
FISH combined with flow cytometry was used to analyse the
composition of faecal samples, targeting the 16S rRNA of
three major groups of bacteria.22 The 16S rRNA specific
oligonucleotide probes used in this study are listed in table 1.
Probes EUB 338 and NON 338 were used as positive and
negative controls, respectively. Probes Bac 303, Erec 482, and
Clep 866 were used to detect the Bacteroides, Clostridium
coccoides, and Clostridium leptum groups, respectively. The
specificity of probe Clep 866 was optimised by using
unlabelled mismatched oligonucleotides as competitors
(table 1). Faecal samples stored at 270˚C were fixed in
paraformaldehyde and hybridised with specific probes, and
positive signals were detected by flow cytometry as previously
described.22
Statistical analysis
Data were analysed using the x2 test or Student’s t test for
two independent sets of samples. A p value ,0.05 was
considered to denote a significant difference.
RESULTS
Metagenomic libraries
Bacterial fractions from the six healthy individuals and the
six CD patients were pooled to build a healthy subject DNA
library (HSL) and a Crohn’s patient DNA library (CPL). Each
metagenomic DNA library contained 25 000 fosmid clones.
The cumulative size of the inserts spanned 2 Gbp, corre￾sponding to approximately 500 times the size of the E coli
genome (4.16106 bp). The very low redundancy of the cloned
fragments, as determined by randomly searching for cloned
inserts having similar end sequences (data not shown),
confirmed that major biases can be avoided by using this
method. The DNA macroarrays were constructed after fosmid
DNA extraction from the 50 000 recombinant clones and
spotting on two nylon membranes, one for HSL and one for
CPL (fig 1).
16S rRNA screening and sequencing, and
bioinformatics analysis
Among the 50 000 clones, 1520 were positive for 16S rRNA
sequences (650 from HSL and 870 from CPL). Each clone was
sequenced with a set of four universal bacterial primers
spanning the 1500 bp of the 16S rRNA gene sequence. After
quality control and assembly, 1190 clones yielded sequences
of more than 1000 informative base pairs suitable for
phylogenetic analysis (536 for HSL and 654 for CPL).

Composition of the healthy and CD microbiota
Analysis of the 1190 clones identified 125 non-redundant
OTUs (or ribotypes; GenBank accession Nos AY850400 to
AY850541). According to public nucleotide databases (NCBI
and RDP-II), 95 OTUs corresponded to species that are not
contained in current culture collections (figs 2, 3). All of the
molecular species thus recovered fell into four phylogenetic
phyla: Bacteroidetes (53 OTUs; Gram negative bacteria),
Firmicutes (54 OTUs; low GC Gram positive bacteria),
Actinobacteria (nine OTUs; high GC Gram positive bacteria),
and Proteobacteria (nine OTUs; Gram negative bacteria).
Sixty six OTUs appeared completely novel, being unrelated to
previously cultured microorganisms or to cloned rRNA
sequences. The 89% coverage provided by the 1190 clones
indicated that any new clone sequenced only had an 11%
chance of corresponding to an unknown species. Hence our
metagenomic libraries covered nearly 90% of the dominant
species that could be cloned from the faecal ecosystem.
Comparison of the CD and healthy libraries
Coverage values of the two libraries were not significantly
different (90% and 87% for HSL and CPL, respectively). The
same four dominant phyla were found in the two groups of
subjects (fig 4). Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes accounted for
the largest number of ribotypes, as shown by the 16S rRNA
phylogenetic trees (figs 2, 3). The total number of
Bacteroidetes OTUs was similar in the two groups, while
differences in the Prevotella and Bacteroides fragilis subgroups
were found. In addition, one ‘‘unclassified
Porphyromonadaceae’’ species was observed only in the CD
library and represented as much as 8.7% of the clones. The
most striking difference was a global loss of microbial
diversity in CD (88 ribotypes in healthy subjects, 54 in CD
patients). This was essentially due to far fewer Firmicute
ribotypes in CD patients (fig 3). Indeed, 43 Firmicute OTUs
were found in healthy subjects compared with only 13 in the
CD patients (p,0.005) (fig 4). The number of ribotypes
shared by the two libraries was also significantly lower in this
phylum (2/13, 15%) than in the Bacteroidetes group (13/33,
39%).
Confirmation by FISH results
The next question to be addressed was whether this
reduction in diversity in Firmicutes could be due to one

patient or would it be found in every patient in the study. To
address this question, we applied a FISH method to each of
the 12 faecal samples individually. FISH combined with flow
cytometry was used to count viable bacteria with ribosomal
RNA transcription activity. Specific probes against the three
major bacterial groups (table 1) revealed a significant relative
reduction in the Clostridium leptum group in CD patients
compared with healthy subjects (p,0.02) whereas the
proportions of Clostridium coccoides and Bacteroides groups were
similar in the two groups of subjects (fig 5). The results
obtained by FISH and the metagenomic approach were
highly consistent, showing a marked reduction in the
number of active cells and in the diversity of the Clostridium
leptum group in patients with CD.
DISCUSSION
This study suggests that the faecal microbiota of patients
with CD contains a markedly reduced diversity of Firmicutes.
In particular, the Clostridium leptum phylogenetic group was
significantly less abundant in CD patients than in healthy
subjects. This observation among patients in remission
suggests that it could correspond to a primary modification
(that is, a modification of the faecal microbiota that may
exist before the onset of the disease and/or in the absence of
major perturbations caused by the inflammation process).
We focused on patients in quiescence because during the
active phase of the disease the microbiota is remodelled6 and

alterations in its composition could be a consequence more
than a cause of inflammation.
A previous analysis of amplified and cloned rRNA gene
libraries from healthy volunteers (n = 3) and CD patients
(n = 3)23 also indicated that the Firmicutes (Clostridium
leptum and Clostridium coccoides groups) had significantly
lesser complexity in CD (25 v 73 OTUs) (Ire`ne Mangin,
personal communication). These results were obtained
whether the subjects were considered individually or pooled.
As in the present study, the number of ribotypes in the
phylum Bacteroidetes was similar in the two libraries.
Although the cause of inflammatory bowel disease remains
unknown, the indigenous intestinal microbiota is considered
a major if not the main trigger of inflammation, both in
animal models and in humans.24 A genetically determined
abnormal response to indigenous bacteria is suspected, as
well as dysbiosis.3 24 However, the precise microbial species or
metabolites involved remain unknown. We share the current
concept that the onset of CD could be due to an altered
microbiota and that a dysbiosis could enhance the risk of
disease. In that respect, the reduction in proportion of one
microbial group is expected to be compensated for by a
greater representation of others. In the present study, the less
diverse and less represented microbial species in CD patients
were Gram positive anaerobic bacteria that usually account
for a major fraction of the faecal microbiota of healthy
subjects. These species may provide CpG DNAs with
immunomodulatory activities.25 A reduced proportion of
Firmicutes may also be compensated for by an increased
representation of Gram negative bacteria which are known to
express more proinflammatory molecules such as lipopoly￾saccharide. In agreement with the latter point, we observed a
specific association of Gram negative species of the
Porphyromonadaceae family in CD patients.
In both of our libraries, the Firmicutes comprised mainly
the Clostridium leptum and Clostridium coccoides groups, along
with a number of unidentified species. These two groups
have been described as essential components of the human
indigenous intestinal microbiota.22 26 They contain all known
microorganisms, producing large amounts of butyrate, which
is not only the main energy source for colonic epithelial cells27
but also inhibits proinflammatory cytokine mRNA expression
in the mucosa, by nuclear factor kB activation and IkB
degradation.28 Loss of butyrate producers observed here could
upset the dialogue between host epithelial cells and resident
microorganisms, hence contributing to the development of
CD associated ulcerations.
Our results emphasise the advantages of molecular
methods over culture based approaches for comprehensive
description of complex microbial communities.29 Indeed, we
found 69% totally novel OTUs in CD patients, compared with
34% in healthy subjects, further supporting the existence of
microbial dysbiosis in CD1 23 (figs 1, 2, respectively). Known
OTUs identified in this study (corresponding to previously
cultured microorganisms) corresponded to species known to
reside in the human29 and pig30 intestinal tract. These results
are in good agreement with previous studies of human faeces
using molecular approaches.23 Together, 16S rRNA sequence
based studies of the human intestinal microbiota have led to
the recognition of more than 50% totally novel species,31 32
suggesting that this community may be far more complex
than previously thought.6
Our use of a DNA macroarray based strategy to analyse two
large metagenomic libraries yielded evidence that CD may be
characterised by a reduction in normal anaerobic bacterial
diversity, especially among the Firmicutes, and did not
support the role of a specific pathogen.
Although our study only involved a limited number of
subjects (six healthy volunteers and six patients), our results
were the same whether samples were pooled in the
metagenomic approach or taken individually using the
FISH method. Our observations point to formerly unrecog￾nised specificities of the faecal microbiota of CD patients.
Nevertheless, the number of subjects analysed was small as
the metagenomic approach cannot be applied to a large set of
samples. Our results should be confirmed by an epidemio￾logical investigation focusing on the reduction in Firmicutes
as well as over representation of species such as ‘‘uncultured
Porphyromonadaceae’’. Specific diagnostic tools could be
designed to detect these. In addition, these would allow a
more targeted use of antimicrobials or probiotics.
Genetic exploration of metagenomic libraries will provide
access to the identification of genes and functionalities
specific for CD. This is currently under investigation.

Figure 5 Fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) of faecal samples,
coupled to flow cytometry. The 16S rRNA of the three major groups of
bacteria was targeted by FISH. Faecal samples from six healthy donors
and six Crohn’s disease (CD) patients were analysed independently.
Mean bacterial percentages are reported for healthy donors and CD
patients. Healthy subjects and CD patients were compared using the
Student’s t test for two independent sets of samples. *p,0.02, significant
difference between healthy subjects and CD patients for the Clostridium
leptum group.

EDITOR’S QUIZ: GI SNAPSHOT ..................................................................
Robin Spiller, Editor Blurred vision: cause?
Clinical presentation
A 46 year old man was found to have abnormal liver function
tests. He had a history of high alcohol intake and intravenous
drug abuse. His work up showed him to be infected with the
hepatitis C virus, genotype 3a. Human immunodeficiency
virus testing was negative. There was no other past medical
history. The patient abstained from alcohol and was
commenced on interferon (Viraferon) and ribavirin. In the
final month of treatment the patient complained of blurred
vision in the right eye. Visual acuity was reduced in the right
eye at 36/60, with normal acuity in the left eye. Blood
pressure was 200/140. Fundoscopic image is shown (fig 1).
Question
What is the cause of the patient’s visual disturbance?
