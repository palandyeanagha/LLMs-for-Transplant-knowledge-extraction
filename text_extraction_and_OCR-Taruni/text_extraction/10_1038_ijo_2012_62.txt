Obesity and the risk and outcome of infection
R Huttunen1 and J Syrja¨nen2
The interactions between obesity and infectious diseases have recently received increasing recognition as emerging data have
indicated an association between obesity and poor outcome in pandemic H1N1 influenza infection. Obesity is an established
risk factor for surgical-site infections, nosocomial infections, periodontitis and skin infections. Several studies indicate that acute
pancreatitis is more severe in the obese. Data are controversial and limited as regards the association between obesity and the risk
and outcome of community-acquired infections such as pneumonia, bacteremia and sepsis and obesity and the course of HIV
infection. As the cause–effect relationship between obesity and infection remains obscure in many infectious diseases, further
studies are warranted. The consequences of obesity may have substantial effects on the global burden of infectious diseases.

INTRODUCTION
The incidence of obesity has increased rapidly during recent
decades. More than 30% of Americans are obese, as are more than
a quarter of men and women in several European countries.1
According to the World Health Organization definition, a person is
considered overweight if her/his body mass index (BMI) is 425,
and obese if BMI is X30.2 A recent study on the Framingham
Cohort indicated that the number of years lived with obesity is
directly associated with the risk of mortality.3
Emerging data indicate an association between obesity and
infectious diseases.4 Although the mechanism underlying these
findings is not well established, a number of potential factors
may be involved (Table 1).5 Obesity may influence either the
risk of getting an infection or the outcome of an infection once
it is established. Obesity-related immune system dysregulation,
decreased cell-mediated immune responses, obesity-related co￾morbidities, respiratory dysfunction and pharmacological issues
have been proposed as possible mechanisms.4,6 In the absence
of sufficient scientific evidence, no dosing guidelines of anti￾microbials for obesity have been published, although such would
be eagerly awaited.7
The evidence would appear more substantial regarding the
association between nosocomial as opposed to community￾acquired infections, except for the recent findings in influenza
pandemics. This may be due to the fact that the BMI is recorded
routinely only in patients undergoing invasive and surgical
procedures, which enables study of this association retrospec￾tively, whereas the BMI is not usually recorded in hospital/health
care admissions for other reasons or in the case of community￾acquired infections.4 This may cause bias when evaluating the
potential impact of obesity in community-acquired as compared
with nosocomial infections.
Studies on the interactions between obesity and infection have
used heterogeneous materials and the reporting of methods how
BMI data were obtained are variable. Obesity is associated with
multiple comorbidities such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension,
which may contribute to outcomes.8 These factors may cause
considerable variation between different studies in this field
and the composition of multivariate models vary. Large
epidemiological studies have studied the potential association
between obesity and increased pneumonia risk showing
controversial results.8–10 Kornum and associates documented
that adjustment for major chronic diseases eliminated the
association between obesity and pneumonia risk documented in
an univariate model in one large epidemiological study.8 One
possible bias in pneumonia studies is a misclassification bias due
to difficulties in interpreting X-ray photographs of overweight
persons.11 BMI data may be obtained by objective measurement
on hospital admission or by inquiry of patient or closest relative.
An important factor contributing to our knowledge on the
convergence of obesity and infection is that excpecially the
earliest studies in this field have used variable BMI cut offs to
define obesity.12,13
The present article has its emphasis on reviewing current
knowledge regarding the association between obesity and the risk
and outcome of several infectious diseases. Areas with limited or
controversial data are summarized in Table 2. The findings here
would indicate that the association between obesity and
infections has not been comprehensively established in a wide
range of infectious diseases.
THE MECHANISMS OF OBESITY IN INFECTIOUS DISEASES
Obesity has been shown to have substantial effects on immune
surveillance.14 Immune system cells and adipocytes evince
similarities in structure and function such as the production of
various inflammatory mediators.14,15 Adipose tissue mediates
immune system and adipose tissue interactions by the secretion
of adipokines, for example, leptin.15 The differentiation of macro￾phages has been shown to be affected by the presence of obesity

and complex interactions take place between immune cells and
metabolic cells.15 Obesity violates the well-balanced system of
adipocytes and immune cells, with subsequent disturbance to
the immune surveillance system. This leads to dysregulated
immune response, impaired chemotaxis and altered macrophage
differentiation (Figure 1).14,15
The adipocyte derived cytokine leptin is a link between
inflammation and metabolic alterations. Circulating leptin levels
have been shown to reflect adipose tissue mass and nutritional
status in noncritically ill individuals.16 Serum adiponectin, which
also originates from adipose tissue, has been shown to predict
mortality in critically ill patients upon admission to the intensive
care unit (ICU).17 Obesity has been shown to be strongly
associated with circulating levels of C-reactive protein and
fibrinogen, and chronic inflammation has been considered to be
one pathophysiological mechanism explaining the increased risk
of atherosclerotic disease associated with obesity.18
Although obesity involves a risk of complications, prolonged
hospitalization and need for mechanical ventilation following
major trauma,19 the development of acute respiratory distress
syndrome20 and constitutes a risk factor for prolonged
hospitalization associated with critical illness,21 the impact of
obesity on intensive care-related mortality is controversial.21
Obesity has been shown to have an effect on pulmonary
function22 and wound healing.23 It is somewhat surprising, how
little is known as to the appropriate dosing of antimicrobials in
obesity and there are no antimicrobial treatment guidelines for
the obese.4,7
INFLUENZA
Interest in the interactions between obesity and infection has
been prompted by the influenza H1N1 pandemic, which has
shown that obesity affects the disease course and increases the
mortality rate in this condition.24–32 Half of Californians X20 years
of age hospitalized with the 2009 H1N1 infection were obese.24
One prospective, observational and multicenter study undertaken
in 144 ICUs in Spain indicated that obesity was associated with
higher ICU resource consumption and longer ICU length of stay in
H1N1 influenza.33 One review of studies originating from the
Southern hemisphere indicated that obesity and morbid obesity
were more commonly reported as the level of health care
increased in patients with H1N1 infection.29 Interestingly, obesity
has been shown to be a particularly significant risk factor among
patients o60 years of age.25 Obesity has also been shown to be a
risk factor for mortality in patients with H1N1 infection-related
community-acquired bacterial pneumonia.34 A recent systematic
review and meta-analysis including a total of 3059 subjects
confirmed findings in individual cohort studies indicating that
obesity is associated with higher risks of ICU admission or death in
patients with influenza A (H1N1) infection.35 One recent global
study conducted by World Health Organization included 70 000
laboratory confirmed cases with H1N1 from nearly 20 countries
indicated a clear association between obesity and poor outcome
in H1N1.36
Data on the impact of obesity on the outcome of influenza virus
infections other than H1N1 are scant. A recent cohort study by
Kwong et al.
37 over 12 influenza seasons aimed to examine the
association between obesity and respiratory hospitalizations
during seasonal influenza epidemics. They showed that severely
obese patients are at increased risk for respiratory hospitalization
during influenza seasons. BMI data in this study were based on
self-reported height and weight.
The mechanisms underlying these findings have not been fully
established. Excessive proinflammatory cytokine release is a key
determinant in severe H1N1 infection,38 and the pathogenesis of
severe influenza infection shares properties similar to those in
sepsis syndrome. One recent study has shown that the obese
evince more intense interleukin-8 release in H1N1 infection as
compared with normal-weight individuals.38 Sheridan et al.
39 have
shown that obesity is associated with impaired immune response
to influenza vaccination in humans. In animal studies diet induced
obese mice have been shown to be more susceptible to morbidity
and mortality during influenza infection than lean mice due to
altered innate immune responses characterized by minimal
induction of interferon-alpha/beta, delayed expression of
proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, impaired natural
killer cytotoxicity and impaired dendritic cell presentation. Thus,
obesity interferes with cellular responses during influenza
infection, leading to alterations in the T-cell population that
ultimately may be detrimental to the host.40
The impact of obesity on infection susceptibility in H1N1
infection has not been established. As most patients with

influenza have mild-to-moderate disease with no need for
hospitalization or contact with health care, the effect of obesity
on the susceptibility to influenza has been difficult to assess.
Influenza pandemic has shown that BMI is not a measure routinely
recorded on patients admitted to hospital or health care
institutions.
In conclusion, obesity has been shown to be associated with
adverse outcome in pandemic H1N1 infection. There are no data
on the association between obesity and the risk of influenza virus
infection.
URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS
Several studies have studied the risk of urinary tract infection (UTI)
in obese. The earliest study in this field did not indicate an
association between obesity and increased risk of UTI; a large
epidemiological study conducted in the 1980s of 17 032 women
taking part in the Oxford Family Planning Association contra￾ceptive study indicated that obesity was associated with a
decreased risk of UTI.13 Vessey et al.13 used BMI X24 as an
obesity definition, which differs from the current obesity
definition. Recent studies have consistently shown that obesity
increases the risk of UTI. A recent cohort study by Semins et al.41
with a total of 95 598 subjects indicated that obesity is a risk
factor for UTI. As regards pyelonephritis, the obese were nearly
five times more likely to be diagnosed than were the nonobese;
females were at particularly higher risk.41 Obesity proved to be a
risk factor for UTI in a cohort study of male patients with diabetes
mellitus42 has been shown to predispose to UTI after traumatic
injury43 and ICU-acquired UTIs.44 Obesity has been shown to
be a risk factor for UTI in pregnant woman45 and during the
postpartum period.46 A retrospective review and analysis of
adult postoperative complications after noncardiac moderate
or major surgery indicated that obesity confers a risk factor
for UTI in these patients.47 In conclusion, several recent studies
have shown an association between obesity and an increased
risk of UTI. One large epidemiological study conducted in the
1980s showed opposing results, which may originate from
methodological differences. There are no data on the effect of
obesity on the outcome of UTI.
PERIODONTITIS
Obesity has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of
periodontitis,48 having been shown to predict it independently of
smoking.48 A recent meta-analysis has likewise indicated a
statistically significant positive association between overweight
and obesity and the risk of periodontitis.49 One other recent meta￾analysis also indicated a consistently positive association with
obesity in the development of periodontal disease. The authors
concede that with few high-quality longitudinal studies it is not
possible to distinguish the temporal order of events, this limiting
the evidence that obesity is a risk factor for periodontal disease or
in conversely, that periodontitis might increase the risk of weight
gain.50
Interestingly, in animal models (for example, rats) chronic admin￾istration of lipopolysaccharide and proteases induces periodontal
inflammation and hepatic steatosis,51 and one cohort study has
indicated that the severity of periodontal disease is associated with
the development of glucose intolerance in non-diabetics.52
NOSOCOMIAL INFECTIONS AND SURGICAL INFECTIONS
Nosocomial infections incur substantial clinical and economic
costs.53 Cohort studies indicate an association between obesity
and the risk of nosocomial infections.12,54 A recent retrospective
case–control study has shown obesity to be an independent
predictor of nosocomial bloodstream infection in older adults.54

ICU AND TRAUMA PATIENTS
In retrospective and prospective studies, obesity has been shown
to be an independent risk factor for infection after trauma.43,55,56
Obese patients had a more than twofold increase in the risk of
acquiring a bloodstream, urinary tract or respiratory infection in a
prospective cohort study of critically ill trauma patients.43
Obesity has been shown in several cohort studies to have an
impact on the infection risk in critically ill ICU patients.43,57–59
Obesity has been shown to be an independent risk factor for ICU￾acquired catheter and blood stream infections in one prospective
observational study.57 The authors concluded that one reason for
this observation may be explained by the relative difficulty in
obtaining venous access in these patients.57 A large multicenter
prospective study of nearly 200 ICUs in 24 European countries
showed that obese and very obese patients more frequently
developed ICU-acquired infections than patients in lower BMI
categories.58 In this study by Sakr et al.
58 BMI was prospectively
measured at admission to the study ICU. One risk-adjusted
matched cohort study indicated that obesity was associated with
an increased risk of ICU-associated infections such as septic shock
and ventilator-associated pneumonia.59 However, obesity was
not associated with any increased risk of infection-related case
fatality in these patients.59 One prospective multicenter matched
epidemiologic study, again, indicated no association between
obesity and the risk of catheter-related infection or ventilator
associated pneumonia.60 However, the study in question
compared severely obese (BMI X35) with nonobese (BMIo30)
leaving the group of those with BMI X30 to o35 out of the
study. In this study, patients were weighed at ICU admission
(lift bed scale).
In conclusion, several studies indicate an association between
obesity and the risk of ICU-related or posttraumatic infections, but
not all have confirmed this. One potential bias in studies of this
field is the challenges in obtaining BMI data in critically ill patients,
and weight measured at admission may not reflect patients’ real
weight because of vascular fluid volume depletion.
SURGICAL INFECTIONS
Prospective and retrospective cohort studies have indicated that
obesity is associated with a significantly increased risk of skin and
soft-tissue infection (SSI) after surgery.61–64
INFECTIONS FOLLOWING GASTROSURGERY
Overweight and obesity have been shown to be a risk factor for
infection after pancreatoduodenectomy in cohort studies.65,66
Obesity has been shown to be associated with a higher risk of
post-operative pelvic abscesses after cancer surgery67 and a
predictor for surgical-site infection after hepatic resection.68
In laparoscopic bariatric procedures, the super obese group
proved to have a significantly greater incidence of postoperative
complications, including superficial and deep wound infections,
sepsis, septic shock and 30-day mortality.69 One study of patients
undergoing colectomy has shown that morbidly obese patients
had a higher risk of surgical-site infection as compared with
normal-weight subjects, whereas the occurrence of pneumonia,
UTI or 30-day mortality did not differ significantly by BMI.70 Gervaz
et al.
71 have shown that obesity was strongly associated with
postoperative SSI after colon or rectum surgery and a simple
clinical score based on four preoperative variables including
obesity data was clinically useful in predicting the risk of SSI in
these patients.71
INFECTIONS FOLLOWING VASCULAR AND CARDIAC SURGERY
Obesity has been in one large cohort study shown to almost
double the risk of postoperative SSI after lower extremity bypass.72
However, the risk of sepsis or septic shock was not affected by
obesity.72 Several cohort studies indicate an association between
obesity and the risk of sternal wound infection, mediastinitis
and bacteremia after cardiac surgery.73–77 In one retrospective
cohort study, obese diabetic patients had a 7.7-fold increased
risk of deep chest infections after controlling for confounders
and an independent risk factor for superficial surgical-site
infections.78 A recent nested case–control study indicated
that obesity is a risk factor for SSI after central venous catheter￾related infection in cardiac surgery.79 Several cohort studies
have identified as an independent risk factor for leg-harvest-site
infection.80,81
INFECTIONS FOLLOWING ORTHOPEDIC SURGERY
Morbid obesity and obesity combined with diabetes are risk
factors for periprosthetic infection after total knee arthroplasty.82
Cohort and case–control studies indicate that obesity increases
the risk of prosthetic hip infection.83,84 In a case–control study of
pediatric patients undergoing spinal surgery, obesity was a risk
factor for SSI.85
In conclusion, several studies indicate that obesity increases the
risk of surgical infections. The association seems to be most
evident in vascular, cardiac and orthopedic surgery.
OBESITY AND THE OUTCOME OF NOSOCOMIAL AND
SURGICAL INFECTIONS
The impact of obesity on the outcome of various surgical or
nosocomial infections remains obscure. One retrospective cohort
study in appendicitis patients indicated that the outcome of
appendicitis pre- or postoperatively did not differ between obese
and non-obese subjects. Only the length of stay in hospital in
those with perforation was adversely affected by obesity.86
One recent study on patients with durable mechanical support
at a single institution from January 2000 to December 2008
showed that obese patients, as compared with the non-obese,
had higher incidence rates of sepsis (64.5% vs 34.7%, respectively,
P ¼ 0.006) and reoperation for infectious complications (34.2% vs
13.3%, respectively, P ¼ 0.014).87
PANCREATITIS
Data on the potential effect of obesity on the risk of acute
pancreatitis are scant. One large epidemiological study has
indicated that obesity is a risk factor for gallstones, gallbladder
disease and pancreatitis.88
Several studies indicate an association between obesity and
severe pancreatitis. Obesity has been shown to predispose to
local complications of pancreatitis such as pancreatic pseudo￾cysts, abscess and necrosis.89,90 Visceral obesity and adipose
tissue have proved particularly important as underlying factors
in the pathophysiology of severe diseases. It has been shown
that adipokines secreted from adipose tissues enhance and
maintain systemic inflammation in acute pancreatitis.91,92
The severity of acute pancreatitis in obese patients and in
patients with central fat distribution seems to be related to the
amplification of systemic inflammatory reaction.91 A meta-analysis
published in 2004 indicated that severe acute pancreatitis is
significantly more common in the obese, and that obesity is
associated with systemic and local complications.89 However,
mortality was not significantly higher in obese than in non-obese
subjects.89 On the other hand, an updated meta-analysis of
the same group in 2006 indicated that obesity was signifi￾cantly associated with increased mortality in acute pancreatitis.90
In conclusion, obesity is a risk factor for severe pancreatitis but
data on the potential effect of obesity on the risk of acute
pancreatitis are limited.

SKIN INFECTIONS AND CELLULITIS
Obesity causes changes in skin barrier function, the lymph system,
collagen structure and function, and wound healing. Evidence
suggests that the vascular supply is impaired in obese persons and
obesity affects both macro- and microcirculation. Obesity is
associated with a wide range of skin diseases.23
Case–control studies indicate an increased risk of cellulitis and
skin infections in the overweight93 and obese.94,95 Bjo¨rnsdottir
et al.
96 in a prospective case–control study showed obesity to
constitute a risk factor for cellulitis in a univariate model, but
in a multivariate model the finding no longer persisted after
controlling for other factors. However, several studies have
indicated that obesity predisposes to erysipelas independently
of potential confounders.93,94 One prospective cross-sectional
study has indicated that obesity is a frequent disease in patients
with erysipelas.97 Data indicate that obesity predisposes to a
significantly increased risk of recurrent soft-tissue infections.94,98
Data on the association between obesity and the outcome
of skin infections are limited. A prospective cohort study has
indicated the outcome of cellulitis to be worse in the morbidly
obese as compared with non-obese subjects.99
To summarize, several well-conducted case–control studies
indicate an association between obesity and the risk of cellulitis,
but the data on the association between obesity and the outcome
of skin infections are limited.
VIRAL HEPATITIS
Cohort studies have shown obesity to be related to an increased
risk of hepatic steatosis and fibrosis in non-diabetic patients with
chronic hepatitis C infection.100,101 Overweight has been observed
to have an adverse effect on the progression of chronic HCV liver
disease, with diminished response to antiviral therapy.100,101
Interestingly, significant changes in insulin resistance and
adipocytokines have been noted to occur under viral treatment,
irrespective of virological outcome.100 Experimental and clinical
evidence has proved the contribution of HCV in the development
of insulin resistance and diabetes in human HCV infection.102,103
A recent cohort study has indicated that compared with subjects
with seroprotective titers from hepatitis B vaccination, those without
protective titers of anti-HBs after vaccination or those with natural
infection with hepatitis B have a higher risk of metabolic syndrome.104
The study in question was limited by the cross-sectional design and
did not answer the causal relationship between the status of
hepatitis B immunity and metabolic syndrome.104 In conclusion,
obesity is associated with an increased risk of hepatic steatosis
in patients with chronic hepatitis C infection.
ANTIMICROBIAL DOSING IN OBESITY
The data on right dosing of antimicrobials in obesity are limited.
Whereas there are clear recommendations for antimicrobial
dosing in children, no such data are available for obese patients.7
A correct understanding of the influence of obesity on anti￾microbial drug dosing is crucial to achieve maximum safety and
effectiveness in therapy. Changes in the pharmacodynamics of
drugs in obese are highly variable and depend on multiple factors,
including degree of obesity, organ function and on drug charac￾teristics.105 Obesity affects volume of distribution (Vd) of drugs
and thus increases the Vd of lipophilic drugs (for example,
fluoroquinolones) and decreases the Vd of hydrophilic drugs (for
example, amikacin and tobramycin).105 Several studies indicate
that physicians frequently underdose antimicrobials in obese
patients.106,107
Choosing appropriate antibiotic dosages is extremely challen￾ging when treating obese patients with severe, deep-seated
infections and multiple organ failure.108 Previous data indicate
that the penetration process of antimicrobials into the interstitial
space fluid is impaired in obese subjects.109 There are some data
on the appropriate dosing of antimicrobials, which require
drug concentration monitoring such as vancomycin and
aminoglycosides, but the right dosing of most antimicrobials is
unclear.7 Data indicate inadequate plasma concentrations for
obese patients, when standard treatment doses of vancomycin are
used.107 A recent multicenter study indicated that vancomycin
concentration in obese subjects was o30% of optimal therapeutic
concentrations when a standard dosing (2 g per day) was used.107
One recent report by Pea et al.
108 introduced the use of real-time
therapeutic drug monitoring by high-performance liquid
chromatography system and showed that this approach would
be invaluable in ensuring rapid clinical response and preventing
drug-related toxicity in a morbidly obese patient with live￾threatening cellulitis and organ failure treated with high-dose
daptomycin plus continuous infusion meropenem. The authors
stressed the point that in considering dosing strategies for
hydrophilic antimicrobials in obese patients, clinicians should
bear in mind that standard methods of estimating renal function
are inaccurate.108 Rapid and easy methods for bedside monitoring
of drug concentrations and toxicity in the case of obese patients
are eagerly awaited. Some data indicate that plasma drug
concentrations may not predict tissue concentrations and that
therefore dosing on the basis of weight-correction factors may
potentially result in subtherapeutic concentrations of the drug in
tissues.109 Morbid obesity has been shown to affect the blood and
tissue levels of prophylactic antimicrobials.110
After the association between obesity and poor outcome in
H1N1 infection became evident, one study has investigated the
appropriate dosing of oseltamivir in obesity. The OPTIMO trial was
a single-center, non-randomized, open-label pharmacokinetic
study of single-dose and steady-state oral oseltamivir phosphate
and its carboxylate metabolite in healthy, morbidly obese and
healthy, non-obese subjects. With single and multiple dosing, the
systemic exposure to oseltamivir was decreased but that of
oseltamivir carboxylate was largely unchanged. The authors
concluded that an oseltamivir dose adjustment for body weight
would not be needed in morbidly obese individuals.111 Studies
that correlate clinical outcomes with plasma concentrations of
oseltamivir and viral susceptibility are needed in the future.
One recent study investigated the pharmacokinetics of
intravenous levofloxacin administered at 750 mg in obese adults.
The peak concentrations of levofloxacin were comparable to those
seen with normal-weight individuals. However, the area under the
concentration–time curve and clearance were quite variable.112
Another recent study showed that obese patients with severe
infections caused by high-minimal inhibitory concentration may
require greater ciprofloxacin dosages.113
Many Gram-negative bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa
and Stenotrophomonas maltophila survive with inadequate blood
antimicrobial drug concentrations and may develop antimicrobial
resistance. Thus, some authors recommend using more frequent
dosing intervals in obese patients in the treatment of organisms
with high minimal inhibitory concentration.7,114 However, these
recommendations are based on single patient cases and no
randomized studies have been conducted to make firm
conclusions on this topic.
In conclusion, obesity has been shown to alter the pharmaco￾kinetics and pharmacodynamics of antimicrobials, and several
studies indicate that underdosing antimicrobials is common in the
treatment of obese patients with infection. However, there are no
guidelines or randomized studies on this topic. Further studies
should focus on the use of antimicrobials in obesity.
CONCLUSIONS
The recent pandemic influenza epidemic and studies on several
other infectious diseases have drawn our attention to the

association between the obesity epidemic and infectious diseases.
However, the associations have not been assessed in a wide range
of infectious conditions. The exact mechanisms underlying
obesity-related changes in the course of infectious diseases are
not established. Multiple factors may be involved, for example,
obesity-related comorbidities, immunological effects and pharma￾cological issues. As the cause–effect relationship between obesity
and infection remains obscure in many infectious diseases, further
studies are warranted. Current data indicate that obesity has
adverse effects on the disease course of pancreatitis and H1N1
infection, and increases the risk of postsurgical and nosocomial
infections. With increasing rates of obesity, we may expect the
mortality and morbidity in infectious diseases to increase. Routine
measurement of BMI in patients visiting outpatient clinics and
in hospitalized patients would potentially increase research
possibilities in this area. As the systematic evaluation of drug
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in obese patients are
limited, this should be incorporated into the drug development
process.
