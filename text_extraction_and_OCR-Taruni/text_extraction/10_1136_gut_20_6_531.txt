SUMMARY We report the cases of two renal transplant recipients suffering from idiopathic portal
hypertension, a condition characterised by increased portal venous pressure in the absence of both
histological lesion of the liver and obstruction of the portal vein. In these two patients, perisinusoidal
fibrosis, invisible by light microscopy, was demonstrated by electron microscopy; it is suggested
that partial obstruction of hepatic sinusoids by perisinusoidal fibrosis could be the mechanism for
increased portal venous pressure in all the patients with idiopathic portal hypertension. In these two
patients, who received 6-mercaptopurine and azathioprine, perisinusoidal fibrosis might be the
consequence of prolonged administration of these drugs.
Idiopathic portal hypertension is a condition charac￾terised by increased portal venous pressure in the
absence of both histological lesion of the liver and
obstruction of the portal vein. The purposes of this
paper are (1) to point out that idiopathic portal
hypertension can develop in renal transplant
recipients, (2) to show that the increase in portal
venous pressure results from perisinusoidal fibrosis,
invisible by light microscopy and demonstrable
only by electron microscopy, and (3) to offer the
hypothesis that perisinusoidal fibrosis might be the
consequence of prolonged administration of 6-
mercaptopurine and azathioprine or of immune
reactions related to renal transplantation.
Case reports
CASE 1
The patient, suffering from renal failure due to
chronic pyelonephritis, was treated by renal trans￾plantation in 1964, when he was aged 23 years.
After transplantation, he received betamethasone,
10-30 mg per day, and azathioprine, 100-150 mg
per day, until November 1974. In October 1971 he
had an episode of gastrointestinal bleeding due to

ruptured oesophageal varices demonstrated by
endoscopy. In June 1973 transient ascites occurred.
From November 1974 renal failure developed
progressively as the consequence of chronic re￾jection of the renal transplant; administration of
betamethasone was maintained until September
1975. In August 1975 the patient suffered a second
episode of gastrointestinal bleeding; the size of
the liver was clinically normal; the liver function
tests were normal, except for a slight increase in
serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (42 IU,
normal: 5-20) and a decrease in BSP fractional
clearance (0-060 min-', normal: 0.110-0-180);
hepatitis B surface antigen and antibody, looked
for by radioimmunoassay, were absent; the
venous phase of coeliac and supramesenteric
arteriography showed large oesophageal and gastric
varices and a patent portal vein. In September 1975
a third and a fourth episode of gastrointestinal
bleeding occurred: endoscopy showed that bleeding
was due to ruptured oesophageal varices; end-to￾side portacaval shunt was performed. At surgery,
a large liver specimen was taken: light microscopy
showed normal liver histology (Fig. 1); electron
microscopy demonstrated fibrosis within all the
spaces of Disse which were examined (Fig. 2). Since
October 1975, the patient had suffered from severe
renal failure and was treated by haemodialysis. In
December 1975, hepatic vein catheterisation was

Idiopathic portal hypertension (perisinusoidal fibrosis) after renal transplantation
performed; free and wedged hepatic venous pres￾sures were 2 and 11 mm Hg, respectively; the
difference, 9 mm Hg, is distinctly higher than the
upper limit of the normal range (1-3 mm Hg); light
microscopic examination of a liver specimen taken
by needle biopsy demonstrated fibrosis (Fig. 3).
Until December 1977 no other episode of gastro￾intestinal bleeding occurred.
CASE 2
In September 1970, when the patient was aged 23
years, he was recognised to be suffering from focal
glomerulonephritis and was treated with predni￾solone, 50 mg per day, and 6-mercaptopurine, 75 mg
per day, until December 1972. Then, the adminis￾tration of both drugs was interrupted and treatment
by haemodialysis was started. In January 1974,
renal transplantation was performed. After trans￾plantation, the patient received azathioprine, 100-
150 mg per day, and prednisone, 15-25 mg per day,
or betamethasone, 10 mg per day, until December
1977. In October 1975, an episode of massive
gastrointestinal bleeding occurred; endoscopy
showed that bleeding resulted from ruptured
oesophageal varices; the liver function tests, in￾cluding serum glutamic pyruvic transaminases and
BSP fractional clearance, were normal; hepatitis B
surface antigen and antibody, looked for by radio￾immunoassay, were absent; the venous phase of
coeliac and supramesenteric arteriography showed
large oesophageal varices and patent portal vein.
In December 1975 end-to-side portaval shunt was
performed. Light microscopy of a liver specimen
taken at surgery showed normal liver histology
(Fig. 4); electron microscopy demonstrated fibrosis
within almost all the spaces of Disse which were
examined (Fig. 5). From December 1975 to
December 1977, no further episode of gastrointes￾tinal bleeding occurred.
Discussion
Idiopathic portal hypertension is defined by the
association of (1) increased portal venous pressure,
(2) patent portal vein, and (3) histologically normal
liver. Cases meeting these criteria have been reported
under various designations: essential portal hyper￾tension (Benhamou et al., 1962), sinusoidal portal
hypertension (Kluge et al., 1970), intermittent
portal hypertension (Mendenhall et al., 1974), non￾Fig. 3 Case 1. Liver specimen taken four months after the specimen shown in Fig. 1. Light

Idiopathic portal hypertension (perisinusoidal fibrosis) after renal transplantation
cirrhotic portal hypertension (Morris et al., 1974),
non-cirrhotic portal fibrosis (Sama et al., 1971),
portal hypertension in the presence of normal liver
morphology (Iber, 1970), portal hypertension in the
absence of both liver disease and vascular obstruc￾tion (Miller and Brandt, 1962). The prevalence of
idiopathic portal hypertension seems to be low in
Europe (Lortat-Jacob et al., 1967; Kluge et al.,
1970; Morris et al., 1974) and North America
(Tisdale et al., 1959; Mikkelsen et al., 1965; Boyer
et al., 1974; Villeneuve et al., 1976), but much higher
in India (Boyer et al., 1967; Sama et al., 1971) and
Japan (Imanaga et al., 1962).
The main clinical manifestations of idiopathic
portal hypertension are splenomegaly and bleeding
oesophageal varices. Ascites is uncommon and, when
present, is moderate and transient (Boyer et al.,
1967; Kluge et al., 1970; Sama et al., 1971). Hepatic
encephalopathy, jaundice, and spiders are absent.
Liver function tests are usually normal, except for
BSP elimination.
The mechanism for increased portal venous
pressure in idiopathic portal hypertension is con￾troversial. It has been suggested that portal hyper￾tension could result from the effect of vasoactive
substances on the intrahepatic portal venous
network (Iber, 1969; Mendenhall et al., 1974); the
nature, the source and even the existence of these
vasoactive substances are, in fact, entirely con￾jectural; moreover, the paucity of the smooth
muscular component in the wall of the intrahepatic
branches of the portal vein (Rappaport, 1975)
makes vasoconstriction an unlikely mechanism for
portal hypertension. It has been hypothesised that
idiopathic portal hypertension could be the con￾sequence of thrombosis of intrahepatic portal
venules; this hypothesis is based on angiography
showing interruption of these vessels (Villeneuve et
al., 1976); however, in most patients with idiopathic
portal hypertension, obstruction of the intra￾hepatic venules has not been histologically demon￾strated, even in large liver specimens such as those
obtained from our patients; nevertheless, thrombosis
of the intrahepatic portal venules has been found at
necropsy in a certain number of patients with
idiopathic portal hypertension (Boyer et al., 1974);
we suggest that the absence of obstruction of the
intrahepatic portal venules in the liver specimens
taken by biopsy and their presence at necropsy
might be explained by thrombosis being a complica￾tion of the end stage, and not the cause of, idiopathic
portal hypertension.
We propose the hypothesis that idiopathic portal
hypertension could be due to partial obstruction of
hepatic sinusoids by perisinusoidal fibrosis, invisible
by light microscopy and demonstrable only by
electron microscopy. This hypothesis is consistent
with, and is reinforced by, the following observa￾tions: (1) perisinusoidal fibrosis has been
demonstrated in our two patients as well as all the
reported cases in which electron microscopic
examination has been performed (Kluge et al.,
1970; Tandon et al., 1970; Sama et al., 1971);
(2) increase in wedged hepatic venous pressure,
observed in our two patients and in some reported
cases (Boyer et al., 1967; Iber, 1970; Sama
et al., 1971; Mendenhall et al., 1974; Villeneuve
et al., 1976), may be reasonably ascribed to perisinu￾soidal fibrosis and would be hardly compatible with
obstruction of the intrahepatic portal venules;
(3) in our patient 1, perisinusoidal fibrosis, initially
demonstrable only by electron microscopy, was
followed by more marked fibrosis, then visible by
light microscopy. It is conceivable that perisinusoidal
fibrosis and hepatoportal sclerosis (Mikkelsen et al.,
1965) may represent the early and the late stage of a
unique entity; this concept offers an explanation
for the existence of intermediates between these two
liver lesions and for the parallelism in the geographic
distribution of idiopathic portal fibrosis and hepato￾portal sclerosis (Imanaga et al., 1962; Boyer et al.,
1967; Iber, 1970; Sama et al., 1971).
Decrease in BSP clearance, a disorder which was
present in our patient 1 and in several reported
cases (Tisdale et al., 1959; Iber, 1970; Sama et al.,
1971; Morris et al., 1974; Villeneuve et al., 1976),
could be ascribed to perisinusoidal fibrosis impeding
the transfer of the dye from blood to hepatocytes
across the spaces of Disse. The other possible
mechanisms for the decreased BSP clearance￾namely, hepatocytic dysfunction and reduced liver
blood flow-are unlikely, as the hepatocytes are
morphologically normal and liver blood flow has
been found to be not or only slightly diminished
(Benhamou et al., 1962; Iber, 1970; Huet et al.,
1975; Villeneuve et al., 1976) in idiopathic portal
hypertension.
The cause of perisinusoidal fibrosis in our patient
is uncertain. The fortuitous coincidence of renal
transplantation and perisinusoidal fibrosis cannot
be ruled out, but is unlikely, as renal transplantation
and idiopathic portal hypertension are very un￾common conditions in the general population in
France. In a small number of patients with idiopathic
portal hypertension or hepatoportal sclerosis, the
liver lesion has been attributed to prolonged
administration of arsenic (Morris et al., 1974; Huet
et al., 1975) or methotrexate (Talerman and
Thompson, 1966; Podurgiel et al., 1973), hyper￾vitaminosis A (Russell et al., 1974), inhalation of
vinyl chloride (Thomas et al., 1975; Smith et al.,
1976); none of these factors was implicated in our

patients. Hepatic fibrosis has been reported in a few
patients receiving 6-mercaptopurine (Lascari et al.,
1968) or azathioprine (Zarday et al., 1972; Du Vivier
et al., 1974; Freiberger et al., 1974), two chemically
related compounds which were administered to
our patients; if, according to our hypothesis, peri￾sinusoidal fibrosis and hepatoportal sclerosis are two
stages of a unique entity, these reports strongly
suggest that 6-mercaptopurine and azathioprine
might be the cause of the liver lesion and portal
hypertension in our patients. The role of renal
transplantation itself in the determination of peri￾sinusoidal fibrosis, although conjectural, cannot be
excluded. It may be relevant to mention that, in
schistosomiasis Mansoni with specific lesions confined
to the portal tracts, non-specific perisinusoidal
fibrosis affecting the whole length of the sinusoids
has been demonstrated and attributed to deposition
of complexes of antibody and antigen produced by
the parasites (Grimaud and Borojevic, 1977);
similarly, perisinusoidal fibrosis after renal trans￾plantation might result from deposition of immune
complexes the presence of which is common in these
patients (Palusuo et al., 1976).
