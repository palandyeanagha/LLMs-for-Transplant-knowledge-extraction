ABSTRACT
Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway plays essential roles in heart development as 
well as cardiac tissue homoeostasis in adults. Abnormal regulation of this signaling 
pathway is linked to a variety of cardiac disease conditions, including hypertrophy, 
fibrosis, arrhythmias, and infarction. Recent studies on genetically modified cellular 
and animal models document a crucial role of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in the molecular 
pathogenesis of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (AC), an inherited disease of 
intercalated discs, typically characterized by ventricular arrhythmias and progressive 
substitution of the myocardium with fibrofatty tissue. In this review, we summarize 
the conflicting published data regarding the Wnt/β-catenin signaling contribution to AC 
pathogenesis and we report the identification of a new potential therapeutic molecule 
that prevents myocyte injury and cardiac dysfunction due to desmosome mutations 
in vitro and in vivo by interfering in this signaling pathway. Finally, we underline 
the potential function of microRNAs, epigenetic regulatory RNA factors reported to 
participate in several pathological responses in heart tissue and in the Wnt signaling 
network, as important modulators of Wnt/β-catenin signaling transduction in AC.
Elucidation of the precise regulatory mechanism of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in 
AC molecular pathogenesis could provide fundamental insights for new mechanism￾based therapeutic strategy to delay the onset or progression of this cardiac disease.
INTRODUCTION
The Wnt pathway is a highly conserved signaling 
pathway throughout evolution. It controls numerous stages 
of embryo development and adult tissue homeostasis 
through atiming- and location-specific activation [1, 2]. 
The pathway a timing is closely controlled by an 
overabundance of potential ligands, receptors, inhibitors, 
and second messengers acting as transcriptional regulators 
or post-translational modifiers. Thus, alterations of Wnt 
activity are often associated with developmental disorders 
and diseases, including cancer, neuronal diseases, and 
skeletal disorders [3–10]. Over the last decade, the role 
of Wnt signaling has been recognized also in cardiac 
pathophysiology and its dysregulation can result in 
processes leading to cardiac dysfunction, such as cardiac 
hypertrophy, fibrosis, arrhythmias, and infarction 
[11–13]. More recently, increasing evidence has indicated 
that the canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway is implicated 
in the molecular pathogenesis of arrhythmogenic 
cardiomyopathy (AC) [14–15].
In this review, we aim to introduce the Wnt signaling 
pathway and to discuss its involvement in AC, together 
with the development of more selective therapeutic 
approaches based on Wnt targeting therapies.
The Wnt signaling cascade
The Wnt pathway is coupled to a highly conserved 
family of secreted protein growth factors (cysteine-rich 
glycoproteins) known as Wnt proteins, that have been 
identified in animals from Hydra to Human [2, 16, 17]. The 
name Wnt, used in mammals, arises from the combination 
and the relationship between the Drosophila melanogaster 
segment polarity gene Wingless and its vertebrate 
orthologous, Int-1, a proto-oncogene discovered in 1984

in mouse [2, 18, 19]. At present, about 100 Wnt genes 
have been identified in various species, and 19 diverse 
Wnt proteins have been isolated in humans [16, 20–22]. 
Although Wnt family members show a high degree of 
sequence similarity, the expression of specific Wnt growth 
factors can lead to largely different signaling cascades [23].
At the cell membrane, Wnt ligands bind the Frizzled 
receptors (Fzd) as well as low-density Lipoprotein 
Receptor-related Protein-5 or -6 (LRP5/6) co-receptors. 
Fzd receptor family includes eleven members in Humans, 
which show seven transmembrane-spanning regions, 
an extracellular N-terminus Wnt-binding domain, and 
an intercellular C-terminal tail, crucial in the signal 
transduction [12, 24, 25]. 
Different Wnt ligands activate different intracellular 
signal transduction pathways, including the canonical 
β-catenin-dependent Wnt pathway, and the non-canonical 
β-catenin-independent Wnt/Planar cell polarity and Wnt￾calcium/protein kinase C pathways [4, 26–28]. Wnt/Planar 
cell polarity (Wnt/PCP) and the Wnt/β-catenin pathway 
primarily regulates cell cycle-related proteins that are cell￾type and context dependent [29], where as the Wnt/PCP 
is responsible for sensory cell orientation, cytoskeleton re￾organization and directed migration [30]. The biological 
function of the Wnt/Calcium pathway, resulting in increased 
cytosolic Ca2+ concentration and activating Ca2+-sensitive 
proteins, is unclear, but it seems to be also involved in the 
controlling of cell fate and cell migration [26, 31].
In this review, we focus on the canonical Wnt 
pathway.
Canonical Wnt pathway
The β-catenin protein is the main signal transducer 
in the canonical Wnt pathway (Figure 1). β-catenin 
is an Armadillo multifunctional protein that can 
play different roles in the cell, combining one as the 
crucial transcriptional activator mediating Wnt signal 
transduction, and another as a structural protein at cell￾cell adhesion junctions [32].
In the canonical Wnt pathway, the absence of Wnt 
ligands determines the rapid phosphorylation of the 
cytosolic β-catenin protein by a cytoplasmic destruction 
complex. This complex consists of the scaffolding 
protein axin, adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumour 
suppressor protein, glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), 
directly responsible for β-catenin phosphorylation at key 
amino-terminal Ser33, Ser37 and Thr41 residues, and 
casein kinase 1 (CK1), which phosphorylates β-catenin 
at the amino acid Ser45 [22, 33]. The post-translational 
phosphorylation of the protein leads to its ubiquitination 
and subsequent proteosomal degradation thus preventing 
its translocation in the nucleus, where, as a consequence, 
the binding of Groucho to T cell factor/lymphoid 
enhancer-binding factor (Tcf/Lef) blocks the transcription 
of Wnt responsive genes [34, 35] (Figure 1).
When Wnt ligands bind to Fzd receptor and LRP5/6 
co-receptors, the Wnt signaling is activated. The binding 
of Wnt recruits the cytoplasmic protein dishevelled (Dvl) 
to the cell membrane, thus sequestering the rate-limiting 
components axin and GSK3β from the degradation 
complex and determining the destruction of the complex 
[36, 37]. The hypo-phosphorylated/stabilized form of 
cytosolic β-catenin accumulates and translocates to the 
nucleus, where Wnt responsive genes transcription is 
activated [22, 34] (Figure 1). Multiple target genes include 
WNT1-inducible signaling-pathway protein 1 (WISP1), 
cell cycle-related proteins (c-Myc, cyclin D1) and the 
negative regulator Axin2 [12].
Wnt/β-catenin in the heart
Wnt signaling in heart development
Heart development and morphogenesis are 
meticulously controlled by the relationship of several 
signaling pathways that cooperate to provide cell fate 
specification. The rigorous expression of Wnt growth 
factors, together with several families of secreted 
factors including TGFbs (Transforming Growth Factor￾Betas), FGFs (Fibroblast Growth Factors), BMPs (bone 
morphogenetic proteins), Notch and Hippo proteins, is 
essentially responsible for heart processes, including 
myocardial specification and proliferation, cardiac 
septation, chamber and cardiac valve formation, as well as 
endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation 
[1, 11, 38–40].
Knocking out β-catenin results in mouse embryonic 
defects at gastrulation, not allowing the investigation 
of a possible Wnt function during cardiogenesis [41]. 
Additional developmental studies using inducible 
promoters to activate or repress Wnt/β-catenin signaling 
in zebrafish embryos at different times of development 
and studies in mouse and human embryonic stem cells 
demonstrate opposite and temporally distinct effects 
for Wnt/β-catenin signaling during early cardiogenesis. 
Wnt/β-catenin signaling at pregastrula stages appears to 
be required for subsequent heart precursor specification, 
whereas this pathway inhibits heart formation during 
gastrulation. This suggests that cells destined to become 
cardiomyocytes are redirected by Wnt signaling towards 
an alternate mesoderm fate [42–44]. On the other hand, 
premature suppression of the Wnt signaling prevents 
the proper formation of endocardial cushions and heart 
valves, and can also result in malformation of the outflow 
tract, including lack of septation of the large arterial 
trunks, transposition of the great arteries or double outlet 
right ventricle [45, 46]. An upregulation of specific 
Wnt ligands has been observed during differentiation of 
embryonic cardiomyocytes into Purkinje fibres, suggesting 
a regulative role of the Wnt signaling in the proper 
development of the cardiac conduction system [11].

A delicate balance between canonical and 
noncanonical Wnt pathways has been implicated in cardiac 
precursor differentiation, as well as in epicardium formation 
and differentiation. The canonical Wnt signaling appears 
to retain the cardiac precursors in a proliferative and 
precursor state [43], whereas the noncanonical signaling 
promotes their differentiation [47, 48]. In the epicardium 
organization, the Wnt/β-catenin signaling is essential in 
pro-epicardial and epicardial cell expansion and Wnt/PCP 
signaling in epicardial-derived cell differentiation [49].
The Wnt/β-catenin signaling also controls 
cardiomyocyte proliferation [50]. In vitro treatment 
of neonatal and adult rat cardiomyocytes with BIO, 
a pharmacological agent inhibiting GSK3, results in 
increased β-catenin activity and promotes cell proliferation 
and mitosis. Thus, the activation of canonical Wnt signaling 
participates in controlling the proliferative capability of the 
differentiated cardiomyocytes by promoting maintenance 
of stem cell properties [51]. In embryonic mouse hearts, 
the inactivation of Hippo, a cardiomyocyte growth and 
Figure 1: Schematic representation of β-catenin–mediated canonical Wnt pathway. (Left) In the absence of Wnt ligands, 
the Wnt signaling is suppressed. Cytosolic β-catenin is phosphorylated by a destruction complex composed of Axin, APC, GSK3β and 
CK1 and then ubiquitinated and targeted to proteasomal degradation. Into the nucleus, the transcription of Wnt target genes is repressed 
by Groucho binding to Tcf/Lef. (Right) Wnt activation. The binding of Wnt ligands to their receptors Fzd/LRP5/6/Dvl, determines the 
disruption of the β-catenin destruction complex, thus inducing the stabilization of the protein, which can translocate into the nucleus, 
function as a cofactor for Tcf/Lef and activate Wnt target genes (APC, adenomatous polyposis coli; β-cat, β-catenin; CK1, casein kinase 
cell factor/lymphoid enhancer-binding factor).

organ-size control pathway, leads to overgrown hearts due 
to increased stimulation of cardiomyocyte proliferation. 
In such hearts β-catenin and Wnt target genes are 
overexpressed, indicating that Wnt/β-catenin signaling 
might regulate pro-growth genes transcription, under an 
accurate control of Hippo pathway [52].
Wnt/β-catenin reporter mice unveiled the spatial and 
temporal distribution of the endogenous status of β-catenin 
activation in several tissues. Transgenic animals exhibit an 
evident reporter gene activity in the cardiac region, where 
it persists up to E10.5, whereas the Wnt/β-catenin pathway 
appears not active in the adult heart [53]. Therefore, 
while the key role of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in several 
processes of early stages of cardiac development has been 
well documented, its activation in the adult heart is mainly 
associated with pathological conditions.
Wnt/β-catenin signaling in cardiac disease and repair 
The adult mammalian heart includes interacting 
populations of cells, predominantly myocytes, fibroblasts, 
smooth muscle cells, endothelial and epicardial cells, all 
arranged in a precise three-dimensional network. Under 
pathological conditions, they can interact with each other 
directly or indirectly, through the expression of growth 
factors and cytokines, to affect a physiological cardiac 
response. 
In terminally differentiated cardiomyocytes, the 
canonical Wnt signaling is normally quiescent [53], but 
it becomes reactivated upon pathological stress, including 
hypertrophy. Cardiac hypertrophy is characterized by 
an increase in cell size and upregulation of fetal-gene 
expression [54]. It can arise from physiological myocyte 
growth or, on the other hand, from pathological cardiac 
remodelling induced by cardiovascular diseases, often 
resulting in fibrosis substitution, diastolic dysfunction, 
and, eventually, heart failure [55–57]. Suppression of the 
signaling by overexpressing GSK3β, the key molecule 
regulating canonical Wnt transduction, attenuates the 
stress-induced hypertrophic response of ventricular 
cardiomyocytes in transgenic mice and leads to the 
development of smaller heart with markedly depressed 
contractility [58]. Both myocyte-specific deletion of 
β-catenin and lack of the Dvl-1 protein gene, responsible 
for the interruption of the Wnt pathway, also result in a 
significantly decreased hypertrophic response to pressure 
overload in transgenic mice, when compared with wild￾type littermates [59, 60]. On the contrary, inhibition of 
GSK3β or overexpression of Dvl-1leads to augmented 
hypertrophy, severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction and 
progressive heart failure, in a pressure overload rat model 
and in transgenic mice, respectively [56, 61].
Many studies have emphasized an important role 
for the canonical Wnt signaling in cardiac fibrogenesis 
[49, 62, 63]. Fibrosis deposition can result from both 
cardiac repair post myocardial infarction and cardiac 
diseases, and it generally impedes electrical wave 
propagation, potentially causing arrhythmias [64, 65]. The 
aberrant activation of Wnt signaling by overexpression 
of Wnt ligands or nuclear accumulation of β-catenin 
in different experimental models, suggests that the 
canonical Wnt signaling alone is sufficient to promote the 
expression of a fibrogenic program in fibroblasts of several 
tissues [66, 67]. In epicardial cells of post myocardial 
infarcted heart, Wnt signaling is enhanced and promotes 
epithelial–mesenchymal transition into fibroblasts [49]. 
Accordingly, in paediatric heart allographs with diastolic 
dysfunction and severe epicardial fibrosis involving either 
epicardial surface or underlying adipose tissue or both, 
immunohistochemical investigation revealed nuclear 
accumulation of β-catenin and TCF4 (T-cell factor 4, the 
main Wnt pathway effector) in fibroblasts, consistent with 
the activation of Wnt signaling in these cells [63].
Moreover, Wnt signaling has been suggested to 
inhibit the apoptotic process involved in the transition 
from hypertrophy to heart failure. Indeed, in heart from 
patients who have developed heart failure, Akt activation 
and consequent GSK3β inhibition seem to protect cardiac 
cells from apoptosis [68].
Wnt1, a major element of the early Wnt/β-catenin 
signaling, is a specific and potent inducer of connexin-43 
expression in cardiomyocytes. This effect results in 
enhanced accumulation of connexin-43 protein and 
formation of functional gap junction channels, supporting 
the hypothesis that dysregulated signaling contributes 
to altered impulse propagation and arrhythmia in the 
myopathic heart [69].
In conclusion, the Wnt/β-catenin signaling is a 
very complex system involved in a variety of cardiac 
pathologies with quite varied effects, according with the 
cell system and timing of intervention. For this reason, 
it can offer possibilities for new insights into disease 
pathogenesis and identification of new therapeutic targets.
Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy
Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (AC) is a rare, 
inherited cardiac disease characterized by ventricular 
arrhythmias, right ventricular dysfunction and sudden 
cardiac death [70, 71]. It has a prevalence between 
1:2000 and 1:5000 and accounts for up to 10% of deaths 
from undiagnosed cardiac disease in the < 65 age group 
[72, 73]. Clinical diagnosis of AC is often difficult because 
of the non-specific nature of the disease features and the 
broad spectrum of phenotypic expressions, ranging from 
concealed to severe forms.
The early “concealed” phase is characterized 
by propensity toward ventricular tachyarrhythmia in 
the setting of well-preserved structural morphology 
and ventricular function. As the disease progresses, 
however, myocyte loss, inflammation, and accumulation 
of fibrofatty scar tissue become evident [74]. The 
typical pathological profile consists of the progressive 

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget 60644 Oncotarget
replacement of the myocardium by fatty or fibrofatty 
tissue, starting from the epicardium or midmyocardium 
and then extending to became transmural. The infiltration 
may be diffuse or regional and is located at the angles of 
the so-called “triangle of dysplasia”, including the inferior, 
apical and infundibular walls [75]. Recent observations in 
genotyped AC patients revealed a characteristic pattern of 
cardiac disease that involves the epicardial surface of the 
basal right ventricle and lateral left ventricle, displacing 
the right ventricular apex [76].
A scoring system to establish the diagnosis of AC 
has been developed on the basis of the fulfilment of major 
and minor criteria encompassing structural, histological, 
electrocardiographic, arrhythmic and genetic features of 
the disease [77, 78].
AC is an inherited cardiomyopathy characterized by 
incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity and it is 
usually transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait, even 
though recessive forms have been reported [15]. Since 
1994, when the first locus was mapped [79], 13 disease 
genes have been identified [80] (Table 1). One or more 
disease-causing mutations are detected in about 60% of 
the patients [81] and most of them affect genes encoding 
for mechanical junction proteins, including desmoplakin 
(DSP) [82], plakophilin-2 (PKP2) [83], desmoglein-2 
(DSG2) [84], desmocollin-2 (DSC2) [85], plakoglobin 
(JUP) [86] and alpha-T catenin (CTNNA3) [87]. In 
cardiomyocytes, mechanical and electrochemical coupling 
between adjacent cells relies on complex entities called 
intercalated discs (IDs), which in turn comprise different 
kinds of junctional apparatuses, namely desmosomes, gap 
junctions and the recently described area composita (this 
latter found only in cardiac muscle) [88] (Figure 2). The 
main components of cardiac desmosomes are two types of 
cadherins, desmocollin-2 and desmoglein-2, two armadillo 
proteins, plakoglobin and plakophilin-2, and desmoplakin. 
Function-wise, desmosomal cadherins are responsible 
for the cell-cell adhesion via their extracellular domains, 
while their cytoplasmic domains interact with the armadillo 
proteins. These latter interact with desmoplakin, which in 
turn binds desmin intermediate filaments, thereby creating 
a continuous link between the cytoskeletons of adjacent 
cardiomyocytes. The area composita comprises some 
of the desmosomal proteins described above as well as 
proteins normally found in adherens junctions. Amongst 
these, N-cadherin interacts with the adjacent cell via its 
extracellular domain and, on the cytoplasmic side, is 
indirectly linked to α-catenin via β-catenin or plakoglobin. 
In turn, α-catenin binds the F-actin cytoskeleton through 
vinculin [88].
As mentioned above, AC is often caused by 
mutations in genes involved in cell-cell adhesion. Indeed, 
a recent report has demonstrated that siRNA-mediated 
silencing of the PKP2 gene in neonatal rat ventricular 
myocytes subjected to mechanical stress led to a much 
greater destabilization of the monolayer structure, thereby 
indicating weakened cell-cell junctions [89]. However, 
other recent evidences suggest that the pathogenetic role of 
ID genes’ mutations in AC does not originate exclusively 
from the mechanical alteration of the junctions but also 
from alterations in the signal transduction processes. For 
example, mutations in several of the ID genes have been 
associated to perturbation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling 
(see below for specific references).

Figure 2: Models of AC pathogenesis. AC gene mutations involve area composita and desmosome proteins (asterisks) and lead to 
abnormalities in intercalated disc (ID) consisting of cell adhesion defects, gap junction and ion channel remodelling. (A) Mutations in ID 
proteins can result also in the perturbation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling. (B) Wnt/β-catenin signaling is suppressed in concomitance with 
the activation of Hippo pathway [93]. The impaired localization of phosphorylated protein kinase C-α to the perturbed IDs is associated 
with activation of neurofibromin 2 (NF2) and results in cascade phosphorylation leading to increased phospho-Yes-associated protein 
(pYAP) and its retention in the cytoplasm. pYAP interacts with β-catenin (β-cat), which is not able to translocate into the nucleus and, as a 
consequence, the expression of the effectors of both Hippo and canonical Wnt pathways (TEAD and Tcf/Lef, respectively) is suppressed and 
adipogenesis is enhanced (B1). Other experimental data reveal that loss of plakoglobin leads to the activation of AKT and the subsequent 
inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) resulting in the stabilization of β-cat and its translocation in the nucleus. Here, β-cat 
interacts with Tcf/Lef causing the increase of the expression of c-myc, c-fos, and cyclin D1, as well as cardiac hypertrophy [98] (B2). The 
disruption of junction integrity can result in increased presence of β-catenin at IDs without the involvement of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. 
However, increased expression of transforming growth factor β-1 (TGFβ1), phospho-SMAD2 (pSMAD2), and Pai1 is consistent with the 
activation of TGFβ pathway responsible for the progressive fibrosis in AC hearts [99] (B3) (DSC2, desmocollin-2; DSG2, desmoglein-2;

Wnt signaling in AC: conflicting evidences
In the last years, studies on zebrafish and mouse 
models and on cultured cell lines, such as induced 
pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from affected patients, 
revealed the involvement of the canonical Wnt signaling 
in the molecular pathogenesis of AC (Table 2).
The progressive replacement of the cardiomyocytes 
by adipocytes and fibrosis is the pathological hallmark of 
AC, which contributes to both cardiac dysfunction and 
arrhythmias. In this regard, in addition to the inactivation 
of junctional mechanical functions, which is supposed to 
lead to myocyte death under physical stress, the alteration 
of canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling could act as a major 
transcriptional switch regulator of myogenesis towards 
adipogenesis [90].
Several studies from Marian’s group demonstrated 
the suppression of Wnt/β-catenin/Tcf/Lef pathway in AC 
due to nuclear translocation of plakoglobin [14, 91, 92]. 
Plakoglobin, also known as γ-catenin, is highly 
homologous to β-catenin, the effector of the canonical 
Wnt signaling, and shares with β-catenin common protein 
partners thus fulfilling some of the same functions [32]. 
Suppression of desmoplakin expression in cultured atrial 
myocytes and in mouse hearts causes the impairment 
of junction assembly and frees plakoglobin from the 
cell membrane. Consequently, plakoglobin translocates 
into the nucleus where it interferes with β-catenin/Tcf 
transcriptional activity leading to an adipogenic switch 
and explaining enhanced adipogenesis, fibrogenesis, 
and myocyte apoptosis observed in human AC [14]. 
Thereafter, through a series of genetic-fate mapping 
experiments, the same group indicated that cardiac 
progenitor cells of the embryonic second heart field 
represent a cell source for excess adipocytes observed 
in the heart of Dsp+/− mouse model for AC [91]. Direct 
evidence for the essential function of nuclear plakoglobin 
in repressing Wnt signaling in cardiac progenitor cells and 
inducing differentiation to adipocytes was demonstrated 
in hearts from transgenic mice overexpressing cardiac 
truncated plakoglobin [92]. Furthermore, the activation 
of Hippo pathway, another regulator of cellular 
differentiation and proliferation, was identified as 
the mechanism for suppression of the canonical Wnt 
signaling in AC. Pathogenic activation of the Hippo kinase 
cascade, resulting from perturbations in ID attributable 
to AC gene mutations, leads to phosphorylation and 
cytoplasmic retention of the transcriptional coactivator 
Yes-associated protein (YAP), that can sequester β-catenin 
and plakoglobin, thus resulting in a reduction of both 
β-catenin/TCF and YAP/TEAD transcriptional activities 
and enhanced heart adipogenesis [93] (Figure 2).
Very recently, a conditional mouse with cardiac 
deletion of Dsp was crossed to the PDRFRA (platelet￾derived growth factor receptor-α)-Cre deleter mice in 
order to obtain a novel mouse model with traceable 
cardiac fibroadipocyte progenitors (FAPs) lacking of 
Dsp. These mice showed increased fibroadipogenesis in 
the heart and mild cardiac dysfunction, if compared with 
control mice. FAPs isolated from the same mouse hearts 
showed enhanced differentiation to adipocytes through a 
Wnt-dependent mechanism [94]. 
Finally, Wnt pathway perturbation, due to reduced 
AKT and GSK3β activation, has been recently associated 
to exercise-induced acceleration of AC phenotype in mice 
overexpressing a mutant form of desmoplakin and exposed 
to a daily running [95]. The identification of a Wnt pathway 
activator as the molecule that can rescue the features of the 
AC phenotype both in a zebrafish and in additional mouse 
models [96, 97] strongly supports the association between 
AC and suppression of this signaling pathway.
On the other hand, conflicting evidences have been 
reported about the canonical Wnt signaling involvement 
in AC pathogenesis. In a conditional mouse model with 
cardiac-restricted JUP deletion showing cardiac alterations 
and dysfunctions similar to those of AC patients, the 
remodeling of the IDs causes an increased β-catenin 
stabilization associated with activated AKT and consequent 
inhibition of GSK3β. In these animals, a Wnt/β-catenin 
signaling activation was suggested to contribute to the 
AC cardiac phenotype [98] (Figure 2). On the contrary, 
in a different mouse model with stable cardiac-restricted 
JUP deletion, the increase of β-catenin levels at IDs of 
cardiomyocytes does not affect the canonical Wnt signaling; 
the TGFβ pathway, mainly involved in the regulation of 
myocyte cell death, including both apoptosis and necrosis, 
and influencing cardiac fibrosis and hypertrophy, results 
upregulated during the early stages of the disease in 
mutant hearts [99] (Figure 2). A 50% increase in levels 
of β-catenin protein, that resulted mislocalized to the 
endoplasmic reticulum, is also observed in heart samples 
from Boxer dogs affected with AC, a natural animal model 
for the disease, compared to non-AC dogs, suggestive of a 
perturbation of the canonical Wnt pathway [100]. 
Up to now, several in vitro studies examined the 
effect of point mutations in the PKP2 gene using iPSC￾derived cardiomyocytes (iPS-CMs) from patient affected 
with AC [101–104]. In all of the cases, mutant iPS-CMs 
appear unable to reproduce the pathologic phenotype in 
standard cardiogenic conditions, but they are inclined 
to lipid accumulation following different treatment 
with adipogenic stimuli, displaying a functional pro￾adipogenic state. Electron microscopy analysis showed 
larger AC iPS-CMs containing lipid droplets compared 
with controls, thus suggesting an increased adipogenic 
potential in these cells. The adipogenic stimuli on the 
mutant cardiomyocytes seemed to be prevented by GSK3β 
inhibitor, thus supporting the possible role of the canonical 
Wnt pathway in AC pathogenesis [103].
Altogether, these findings suggest a central role of 
the Wnt/β-catenin signaling in the disease pathogenesis 
and appear to expand the cellular spectrum of AC,

commonly recognized as a disease of cardiac myocytes, 
towards nonmyocyte cells in the heart. However, the direct 
causal relationship between mutant junctional proteins and 
perturbed Wnt pathway remains poorly understood.
Development of Wnt activators as therapeutics 
for AC
The intricate involvement of Wnt signaling in 
so many biological processes and disease conditions 
made this pathway an obvious but yet difficult target for 
therapeutic intervention. Numerous fields of study have 
investigated both natural and synthetic compounds able 
to induce or inhibit Wnt at multiple stages within the 
pathway. However, despite the evidence of successful 
methods to rapidly screen thousands of compounds to 
identify Wnt pathway modulators, unfortunately these 
molecules cannot be translated yet into the clinical 
practice [105].
To discover potential chemical modifiers in AC, 
a zebrafish model with cardiac-specific expression of 
a truncated form of plakoglobin and manifesting a fully 
penetrant cardiomyopathy, has been generated and used 
to screen a library of bioactive compounds for disease 
modifiers [96] (Table 2). SB216763 molecule has been 
identified as a compound able to prevent heart failure 
and to reduce mortality in the fish model. It also rapidly 
reverses the highly abnormal action potential and corrected 
the marked decreases in INa and IK1 exhibited by mutant 
fish myocytes. Interestingly, SB216763 is annotated as 
an inhibitor of GSK3β thereby increasing canonical Wnt 
signaling [106]. Additional experiments performed in 
neonatal rat ventricular myocytes expressing the same 
mutant plakoglobin and in iPS-CMs from two AC probands 
with PKP2 mutations supported the SB216763 efficacy 
in the reversion or prevention of AC pathobiological 
features. In particular, the distribution of connexin-43 
appears to be restored to normal in truncated plakoglobin–
expressing cells exposed to SB216763, consistent with 
previous studies showing the connexin-43 up-regulation 
by activation of the canonical Wnt pathway [96]. 
More recently, the SB216763 molecule has been 
reported to prevent myocyte injury and cardiac dysfunction 
in vivo in two murine models of AC at baseline and in 
response to exercise (Table 2). GSK3β inhibition improves 
left ventricle function and survival in sedentary and 
exercised mice and normalizes ID protein distribution in 
mutant mouse cardiomyocytes. Redistribution of GSK3β 
to cardiac IDs appeared to be specific for AC, as it was 
not evident in myocardia from patients with dilated, 
hypertrophic or ischemic cardiomyopathy, cardiac 
sarcoidosis, or giant cell myocarditis. Cytoplasmic 
distribution of GSK3β was restored in all in vivo and in 
vitro models treated with SB216763 Collectively, these 
data suggest a key role for aberrant GSK3β signaling in 
the final common disease pathway in AC [97]. However, 
how localization and activity of GSK3β relate to each 
other and how the pharmacologic inhibition of this kinase 
could affect its localization remain to be clarified.
The identification of a molecular activator of the 
canonical Wnt signaling as a promising pharmacological 
agent for AC open the door for new mechanism-based 
therapeutic strategies for patients affected with this 
disease. Such advances would provide a welcome 
alternative to current reliance on traditional therapeutic 
tools (life-style modification, devices, anti-arrhythmic 
drugs, endocardial and epicardial catheter ablation, 
implantable cardioverter defibrillator and transplantation) 
targeting life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias and 
congestive heart once they occur.
MicroRNAs: potential linkers between Wnt/β￾catenin signaling and AC?
Tissue development, physiology, and functions 
are strictly regulated by multiple factors. Among them, 
microRNAs (miRNAs) have been recently described 
as 22–25 nucleotides long noncoding RNAs which 
regulate gene expression at post-transcriptional level. 
This is achieved through imperfect base-pairing with 
complementary sequences in the 3’UTR of their target 
mRNA, leading to translational repression or transcript 
degradation [107]. A single miRNA can regulate multiple 
genes and, in Human, among the 1,800 detected miRNAs, 
800 have been found expressed in the heart [108]. 
Increasing evidence indicates that miRNAs 
participate in signaling networks, such as the canonical 
Wnt/β-catenin signaling, and in promoting or inhibiting 
the progression of many human diseases, including 
cardiomyopathies. In the last years, several studies 
described the correlation between miRNA expression level 
and the regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling, mostly

during cardiac differentiation. Overexpression of miR-499 
in rat bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells is 
sufficient to induce cardiac differentiation, as indicated by 
increased expression of cardiac specific markers Nkx2.5, 
GATA4, MEF2C, and cTnl, through Wnt/β-catenin 
signaling pathway [109]. In particular, miR-499 drives the 
activation of β-catenin, as shown by the decreased ratio 
of phosphorylated/dephosphorylated (Ser33/37/Thr41) 
β-catenin, but the detailed mechanisms involving the Wnt 
pathway haven’t been identified yet [109].
Among the most expressed miRNAs in the heart, 
miR-1 is known to promote cardiomyocyte differentiation. 
Lu and colleagues showed that this miRNA suppresses 
the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling in human iPSCs by 
targeting the receptor Fzd7 and antagonizing the ligand 
Wnt3A. As a consequence, cardiomyocyte differentiation 
is promoted and endothelial cell commitment from 
multipotent cardiovascular progenitors is suppressed [110]. 
Moreover, several papers reported miR-19b as 
a negative regulator of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling. 
Overexpression of miR-19b has been shown to cause 
aberrant heart tube and chamber development and to 
regulate the contractile function of the heart in zebrafish 
embryos by inhibiting the Wnt signaling pathway 
directly targeting Ctnnb1β [111]. Furthermore, inhibition 
of GSK3β leads to β-catenin accumulation, together 
with a partial rescue of the cardiac phenotype [111]. In 
multipotent murine P19 cells, miR-19b overexpression is 
responsible for cellular proliferation and differentiation 
into myocardial cells, and apoptosis inhibition with the 
parallel decrease of Wnt/β-catenin signaling activation 
[112]. In this study, luciferase assays show the direct link 
between the overexpression of miR-19b and the reduction 
of the expression of WNT1 [112]. Accordingly, miR-19b 
knock-down results in the inhibition of proliferation and 
apoptosis of C19 cells, together with the increase of Wnt1 
protein levels/β-catenin signaling expression levels [113]. 
Less frequently, miRNAs have been described to 
modulate Wnt/β-catenin signaling also during cardiac 
diseases. Gain and loss of function studies show that 
miR-145 overexpression leads to an increase in Wnt/β￾catenin signaling activity and the downregulation of 
Dab2, a TGFβ receptor adaptor protein required for 
cardiac protein expression in mesenchymal stem cells, 
in response to TGFβ1 [114]. Interestingly, miR-145 is 
found downregulated in acute myocardial infarction, in 
association with an increase in Dab2 expression level in 
cardiomyocytes in the infarct border zone. These results 
suggest that the Wnt/β-catenin signaling is downregulated 
in cardiomyocytes after acute myocardial infarction, 
but further studies are required to clarify the underlying 
associated mechanism [114].
Interestingly, the expression profile of miRNAs 
recently performed by qRT-PCR in 24 heart samples from 
AC patients revealed that miR-21-5p and miR-135b, which 
are correlated with Wnt and Hippo pathway in cancer, are 
significantly associated with both the myocardium adiposis 
and fibrosis, and might to be useful as therapeutic targets 
[115]. On the other hand, the pathogenic downregulation 
of miR-184 has been identified in PKP2-deficient cell 
lines and mouse models of AC [116]. Overexpression 
of miR-184 had no discernible effects on the transcript 
levels of selected canonical Wnt signaling targets such as 
CTNNB1 and TCF7L2 in HL-1 cells and, vice versa, the 
activation of the canonical Wnt signaling does not affect 
miR-184 levels in the in vitro model. The authors show 
the relationship between the downregulation of miR-184 
and perturbations in E2F1 pathway, suggesting a novel 
mechanism concurring to AC development [116].
Taken together, all these data underline the crucial 
function of miRNAs in the regulation of theWnt/β-catenin 
signaling and are suggestive of a potential role of these 
small RNAs in the pathogenesis and the phenotypic 
variability of cardiac diseases such as AC. Further efforts 
will be needed to find out whether miRNAs represent the 
link between the perturbations at the IDs and the alteration 
of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling activity observed in AC.
Concluding remarks 
Increasing evidence from experimental studies defines 
the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling as a critical player 
in the regulation of cardiac function and dysfunctions. To 
date, the function of this pathway in cardiac hypertrophy, 
fibrosis and arrhythmias have been well established, 
however further investigations are required to unravel its 
role in other pathological conditions. Controversial results 
have been reported about the involvement of Wnt/β￾catenin pathway in the development of AC, an inherited 
cardiomyopathy determined by mutations mostly in genes 
encoding for ID proteins and typically characterised by 
the fibrofatty replacement of the myocardium. Current 
investigations in zebrafish and mammalian models of AC 
mainly indicate that suppression of the canonical Wnt/β￾catenin signaling promotes cardiac remodelling in affected 
hearts. The dual function of β-catenin and plakoglobin both 
in cadherin-mediated adhesion and in gene transcription 
determines a highly regulated and complex protein 
network seemingly able to integrate disease signals from 
the membrane with cellular programs of target gene 
transcription. However, there are still some questions to 
be answered, particularly, which signal molecule(s) can 
play a dominant role in Wnt/β-catenin downregulation 
upon molecular destabilization of ID junctional structures. 
A more comprehensive understanding of the dynamics of 
this signaling in AC cardiomyocytes is therefore required, 
also for the design of safe and effective drug molecules. 
Recently, a small molecule activating the Wnt pathway 
has been experimented and it appears to be remarkably 
effective in preventing or reversing selected features of 
the molecular AC pathology. Based on these promising 
results, Wnt signaling components could represent 

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget 60650 Oncotarget
interesting therapeutic targets for novel treatment strategy 
in AC, hopefully in the near future. Furthermore, a deeper 
investigation on the cross-talk between Wnt and other 
cellular pathways, such as Hippo or TGFβ, may explain 
other molecular mechanisms leading to AC and assist the 
design of efficient combinatorial therapeutic protocols. 
In addition, the relationship between miRNAs-mediated 
regulation of Wnt signaling, and vice versa, needs to be 
further investigated to contribute in the understanding not 
only of AC pathogenesis, but also of other, more common 
forms of heart disease, as well as to provide the basis to 
develop mechanism-based therapies to treat or prevent 
diseases at high risk of sudden death.
