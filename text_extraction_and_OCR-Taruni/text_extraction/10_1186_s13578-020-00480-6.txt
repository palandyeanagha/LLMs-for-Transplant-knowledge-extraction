Mesenchymal stem cell therapy for liver 
disease: full of chances and challenges
Xue Yang, Yan Meng, Zhipeng Han, Fei Ye, Lixin Wei and Chen Zong*
Abstract
Liver disease is a major health problem that endangers human health worldwide. Currently, whole organ allograft 
transplantation is the gold standard for the treatment of end-stage liver disease. A shortage of suitable organs, high 
costs and surgical complications limit the application of liver transplantation. Mesenchymal stem cell therapy has 
been considered as a promising alternative approach for end-stage liver disease. Some clinical trials have confirmed 
the effectiveness of MSC therapy for liver disease, but its application has not been promoted and approved. There are 
still many issues that should be solved prior to using MSC therapy in clinical applications. The types of liver disease 
that are most suitable for MSC application should be determined, and the preparation and engraftment of MSCs 
should be standardized. These may be bottlenecks that limit the use of MSCs. We investigated 22 completed and 
several ongoing clinical trials to discuss these questions from a clinical perspective. We also discussed the impor￾tant mechanisms by which MSCs play a therapeutic role in liver disease. Finally, we also proposed novel prospective 
approaches that can improve the therapeutic effect of MSCs.

Background
With high morbidity and mortality, liver disease presents 
a major threat to human health. Many stimuli, such as 
viral hepatitis, alcohol abuse, drugs, metabolic diseases, 
and autoimmune attack, can trigger chronic/acute liver 
injury and inflammation, which result in liver failure, cir￾rhosis and associated hepatocellular carcinoma. Ortho￾topic liver transplantation is the only effective treatment 
for liver cirrhosis and liver failure. However, the number 
of suitable donor organs is very limited. Adults on the 
waiting list for liver transplantation suffer from a mor￾tality rate of almost 11% [1]. Patients are too weak to 
wait for suitable donor organs, so the best opportunity 
for treatment is missed. In addition, liver transplanta￾tion is expensive and not available for all patients. There 
is an urgent need to search for a more effective and 
feasible treatment for patients with liver cirrhosis and 
liver failure.
At present, cell therapy with hepatocytes, hemopoietic 
cells, immune cells, endothelial progenitor cells and mes￾enchymal stem cells has been suggested to be a promis￾ing candidate therapy for liver diseases [2]. A large body 
of studies investigated their advantages and disadvan￾tages (Table  1). Among the cell types, MSCs have been 
the most promising cells because of their many advan￾tages. (1) MSCs can be isolated easily from a wide variety 
of tissues and can be expanded in vitro without changing 
their properties. (2) MSCs can be injected into patients 
by allogeneic transplantation because of their low immu￾nogenicity. Therefore, we can generate reserves of MSCs 
that we can give to patients at any time. (3) MSCs have 
the properties of self-renewal and can differentiate into 
multiple cell types. (4) Researchers have also shown 
the robust immunomodulation of MSCs. (5) MSCs 
can also produce secretomes, including soluble factors 
and exosomes, which can favor regeneration and injury 
repair. (6) Most importantly, MSCs can migrate to injury

sites where they can exert protective effects. Therefore, 
MSCs have been used to treat various tissue injuries and 
immune-related diseases in clinical trials. To date, 321 
completed clinical trials using MSCs were summarized in 
Fig. 1 according to the website https://clinicaltrials.gov/. 
Among them, bone/cartilage, brain/Nero and immune￾related diseases account for almost 50% of all MSC-based 
clinical trials. In addition, we have noticed that 16 clini￾cal trials are related to liver-related diseases. For liver 
diseases, however, both tissue damage and overactivation 
of inflammation always go hand in hand. Therefore, from 
every perspective, MSCs would be the best candidate 
for cell therapy of liver diseases. However, there are still 
many issues, and any confusion should be resolved before 
MSC application in the clinic.
In this review, several issues that must be addressed 
during clinical treatment of MSCs are discussed from 
clinical perspectives. (1) Which kind of liver disease is 
most suitable for MSC application? (2) How should we 
choose the best source of MSCs, best doses of MSCs 
and best engraftment route of MSCs? (3) What are the 
mechanisms by which MSCs play a therapeutic role in 
liver disease? (4) Finally, we propose potential approaches 
to enhance the therapeutic effect of MSCs, including the 
use of modified MSCs, pretreated MSCs and cell-free 
therapy with MSCs. To address these issues, we exam￾ined both ongoing and published clinical trials of MSC 
applications in liver diseases. Some preclinical tests were 
also used to assist in drawing a conclusion. We would like 
to clear up any confusion about MSC applications in liver 
diseases and help patients receive more appropriate treat￾ment. This review is intended to be beneficial for creating 
a new strategy for MSC application and enhancing the 
therapeutic effect of MSCs. It will also help to develop a 
more specific standard for MSC application.
Which kind of liver disease is most suitable for MSC 
application in the clinic?
MSCs have been shown to exert beneficial effects in 
a range of clinical settings, including the treatment of 
degenerative and immune-mediated diseases while also 
being reported to ameliorate liver injury in the setting of 
both acute and chronic liver damage. However, whether 
MSC-based therapy is more effective than conventional 
treatment and which type of liver disease is best suitable 
for MSCs application in clinic remained unclear.
To find out the indications of MSCs in the treatment 
of liver disease. In this review, we collected a total of 22 
clinical trial articles on MSCs treatment for liver disease 
published from 2007 to 2018 (Table 2). As shown in the 
pie chart in Fig. 2a, 14 of them are about MSCs therapy 
for liver cirrhosis. The other five articles are related to 
liver failure, and three of them are related to complica￾tions after liver transplantation. We found that most of 
these diseases have a common feature, that is, they are

all end-stage liver diseases. And for them, the only effec￾tive approach is organ transplantation, but its practical 
application is constrained by some well-known reasons 
such as the limited availability of donor organs, surgi￾cal complications, immunological side effects, and high 
medical cost [3]. The development of alternative methods 
for treatment of liver disease is highly requested. There￾fore, stem cell therapy, and regenerative medicine are 
being investigated to improve the prognosis of patients 
with those end-stage liver diseases. Evaluation of the end 
points in these studies revealed the safety and efficacy of 
human MSC transplantation. While there are some dif￾ferences in the therapeutic effects of different types of 
liver diseases.
MSC therapy for liver cirrhosis
Liver cirrhosis (LC) is a complication of liver disease that 
involves the loss of liver cells and irreversible scarring of 
the liver. In the 14 articles, patients with cirrhosis caused 
by many forms of liver disease, such as chronic viral 
hepatitis (n=5), chronic alcohol abuse (n=2), primary 
biliary cirrhosis (n=1), autoimmune hepatitis (n=1) 
and other conditions (n=5 heterogeneous cirrhosis), 
were included. We believe that the experimental results 
related to LC caused by viral hepatitis are the most con￾vincing because 4 articles contained large samples of data 
and control groups. In two of the clinical studies men￾tioned above that were published in 2012, 30 patients 
with chronic hepatitis B-related LC and 15 patients with 
chronic hepatitis C-related LC received MSC transfu￾sion. In both studies, compared to the control group, the 
patients transplanted with MSCs showed significantly 
improved liver function, as indicated by the elevation of 
serum albumin levels, a decrease in total serum biliru￾bin levels, and a decrease in the sodium model for end￾stage liver disease score (MELD score) [4, 5]. Consistent 
with the above study, two other clinical trials related to 
LC caused by hepatitis B were carried out by different 
research institutes and clarified that MSC transplanta￾tion further improved the liver function, MELD scores 
and Child–Pugh classification of patients [6, 7]. In the 
trials conducted by Fang, as many as 103 patients were 
recruited to participate in the studies; 50 were in the 
transplant group, and the other patients were in the 
control group. Controlled trials with larger cohorts of 
patients have further confirmed the feasibility of MSC 
transplantation therapy for virus-related cirrhosis.
However, not all studies have revealed MSCs to have 
the desired treatment effect on liver cirrhosis. Moham￾adnejad et  al. [8] enrolled a total of 27 patients with 
decompensated cirrhosis and ruled out viral-associated 
cirrhosis. The patients in this pilot study were hetero￾geneous regarding the etiology of liver cirrhosis. The 
results showed that at the 12 months follow-up, the abso￾lute changes in the Child scores, MELD scores, serum 
albumin, international normalized ratio (INR), serum 
transaminases and liver volumes did not differ signifi￾cantly between the MSC and placebo groups. This indi￾cates that based on this randomized controlled trial, 
autologous bone marrow MSC transplantation through 
the peripheral vein probably has no beneficial effect in 
cirrhotic patients. However, based on the above discus￾sion, MSC therapy has a positive effect on patients with 
viral-associated cirrhosis. Thus, we speculated that there 
may be a certain correlation between the therapeutic 
effect of MSCs and the cause of cirrhosis. Interestingly, 
previous work reported in 2009 by the same author 
showed that 2  months after MSC injection, all patients 
had an improved general condition, quality of life and 
liver function [9]. Why are the results of these two stud￾ies completely contradictory? We note that the beneficial 
effects of MSC transplantation shown in the report pub￾lished in 2009 are based on the absence of control experi￾ments. Even if we observed improvement, we could not

Yang et al. Cell Biosci (2020) 10:123 Page 7 of 18
claim that such improvement is definitely related to MSC 
transplantation. It proved that the controlled trial is criti￾cal to the reliability of clinical trial results. Thus, clinical 
trials associated with heterogeneous LC that lack a con￾trol group have not been explored in depth here.
Furthermore, another phase 2 trial with a control group 
was related to alcoholic cirrhosis. Fifty-five patients (18 in 
the control group, 18 in the one-time MSC group, and 19 
in the two-time MSC group) completed the study. In the 
fibrosis quantification (before versus after), the one-time 
and two-time BM-MSC groups were associated with 25% 
and 37% reductions in the proportion of the collagen area 
following BM-MSC therapy, respectively. While no sig￾nificant change in fibrosis quantification was observed in 
the control group. These results were further confirmed 
by the Laennec fibrosis score and Child–Pugh score [10]. 
In summary, judging from existing clinical trial articles, 
MSC treatment may serve as a potential supplementary 
therapeutic tool to improve liver function in patients 
with viral-related cirrhosis and alcoholic cirrhosis.
To date, only a few large controlled trials have been 
conducted to treat liver cirrhosis patients with MSC 
transplantation. Several articles related to LC with a small 
amount of data or a lack of a control trial also showed 
positive treatment effects for MSCs, which indicated 
that MSC therapy is also promising for the treatment of 
cirrhosis induced by other factors, such as autoimmune 
hepatitis and primary biliary cirrhosis; however, larger 
samples and double-blind controlled trials are needed for 
further verification [11, 12].
MSC therapy for liver failure
Liver failure is a major health problem worldwide due to 
the variety of acute or chronic injuries that are induced 
by alcohol consumption, hepatotoxic drugs, autoimmune 
attack of hepatocytes, or infection with viruses, such as 
hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) [13]. 
In China, HBV infection accounts for the highest pro￾portion of liver failure cases. Therefore, Peng et  al. [14] 
enrolled 53 patients with liver failure caused by hepati￾tis B, who underwent MSC transplantation (105 patients 
served as the control group). The results showed that 
MSC transplantation is safe for patients with liver fail￾ure caused by chronic hepatitis B. The short-term effi￾cacy was favorable, but long-term outcomes were not 
markedly improved. This is in agreement with the results 
of Shi et  al. and Lin et  al. who reported trials of MSC 
transfusion for acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) 
patients in 2012 and 2017, respectively. In both trials, all 
the patients tolerated the transplantation well until the 
end of the follow-up period. MSC infusion is conveni￾ent for patients with HBV-related ACLF and significantly 
increases the survival rate by improving liver function 
and decreasing the incidence of severe infections [15, 16].
In addition to hepatitis B, hepatitis C is also a major 
form of viral hepatitis that has a very high incidence in 
Egypt. Therefore, a research institute in Egypt reported 
a trial that used autologous MSC-derived hepatocyte-like 
cells for end-stage liver failure therapy. The transplanta￾tion group showed improved liver function, including 
increases in serum albumin, Child–Pugh scores, MELD 
scores, and performance status, versus the controls [17]. 
Additionally, for patients with HCV-related end-stage 
liver disease, another study in Egypt provided evidence 
that administration of MSCs followed by granulocyte col￾ony stimulating factor (GCSF) mobilization is excellent 
for liver stem cell therapy to retain liver mass and restore 
liver functions [18]. In summary, the above large con￾trolled trials demonstrated that MSCs play a supportive 
role in the treatment of liver failure and show satisfactory 
tolerability and beneficial effects on liver synthetic func￾tions and hepatic fibrosis resolution.
MSC therapy for complications of liver transplantation
Orthotopic liver transplantation is the only curative 
measure for patients with end-stage liver failure. How￾ever, the risk of complications after liver transplantation 
is still high, even with increases in surgical expertise. 
Two of the most common complications following liver 
transplant are rejection and infection. MSCs offer new 
therapeutic opportunities to prevent and treat solid 
organ transplant rejection. A recent pilot study demon￾strated that UC-MSC therapy can alleviate liver dam￾age and improve allograft histology in liver transplant 
patients with acute graft rejection who did not respond 
to immunosuppressive agent dose adjustments. However, 
the study was not carried out long enough to determine 
whether decreased infection resulted from MSC infusion 
[19].
However, in the same year, Detry et al. [20] enrolled 
10 liver transplant patients to receive MSCs infu￾sion and another 10 patients acted as controls. It was 
shown that no difference in the overall rates of rejec￾tion or graft survival was observed between the MSC 
infusion group and the control group. And Month-6 
biopsies did not demonstrate a difference between 
groups. The study indicated that the immunosuppres￾sion weaning in MSC recipients was not successful. 
The results are completely different and contradictory 
compared to those of the above pilot study. We ana￾lyze that the possible reason might be that the aim and 
experimental design of the two studies were different. 
The pilot study aimed to examine the clinical feasibil￾ity of MSC infusion as a therapeutic option for liver 
allograft rejection, and all patients were treated with 

Yang et al. Cell Biosci (2020) 10:123 Page 8 of 18
conventional immunosuppressive agents in both the 
experimental and control groups, showing the sup￾portive effect of MSC infusion. The study reported by 
Detry et al. aimed to evaluate the feasibility and toler￾ability of a single infusion of MSCs in liver transplant 
recipients, and progressive immunosuppressive with￾drawal was attempted in stable patients who received 
MSCs, which ultimately failed to promote tolerance. 
Therefore, we speculate that perhaps in the presence 
of immunosuppressive agents, MSCs can enhance the 
overall immunosuppressive effect; when the immuno￾suppressive agents are withdrawn, MSCs cannot serve 
alone as an alternative treatment. Another reason for 
this may be that the enrolled patients in the two studies 
were not truly similar. In the pilot study, the patients 
were considered suitable if their liver function did not 
respond to adjustment of immunosuppressive agents. 
These patients may be more sensitive to MSC applica￾tion. Therefore, in the clinical application of MSCs, not 
only the use of an appropriate disease type but also the 
use of appropriate enrolled patients and a reasonable 
experimental protocol design should be considered.
Besides, 56 establishment of practical applications of 
MSCs involve clinical trials to investigate their thera￾peutic potential for treatment of liver disease, which 
also almost including decompensated liver cirrhosis, 
liver failure and complications after liver transplan￾tation, according to ClinicalTrials.gov (Fig.  2b). And 
Based on the data from the published clinical trials 
we discussed above, combined with the relevant basic 
research we have carried out and some of the currently 
approved MSC-based products for clinical applications, 
we believe that MSCs are likely to be more effective in 
the treatment of inflammation-related liver diseases 
and liver transplant rejection complications.
Preparation and engraftment of MSCs
Sources of MSCs
Mesenchymal stem cells were first obtained from bone 
marrow (BM) in 1970 [21], and they are now found to 
reside in various tissues apart from BM, including adi￾pose tissue [22], umbilical cord (UC) [23], umbilical cord 
blood [24], placenta [25], amniotic fluid [26], amniotic 
membrane [27], dental pulp [28], synovium [29], periph￾eral blood, liver, lung [30], skeletal muscle [31, 32], hair 
follicles [33] and many others. Currently, MSCs applied 
for liver disease treatment in the clinic are isolated mostly 
from the umbilical cord and bone marrow, and in only a 
few cases adipose and menstrual  blood-derived MSCs 
have been used (Fig.  3a). This is probably because BM￾MSCs and UC-MSCs are most thoroughly studied types 
of cells, and BM and UC are relatively easy to obtain. 
However, there is still no definite standard for which 
source of MSCs should be used for clinical application. 
Many factors should be considered.
BM-MSCs are most suitable for autologous transplan￾tation. However, BM-MSCs have several limitations that 
should be considered. First, the invasive isolation method 
is a risk to patients, even to healthy donors, because inva￾sion causes an injury that could lead to inflammation. 
The proportion of MSCs in bone marrow is not always 
very high, and they are difficult to proliferate in  vitro 
[34]. In addition, fresh bone marrow from young donors 
is very limited. Most BM-MSC injections involve autolo￾gous transplantation in the clinic. Thus, the condition of 
patients also limits the number and potential of MSCs. 
For instance, age-related declines in proliferation and dif￾ferentiation may weaken the therapeutic effect of MSCs 
[35].
However, UC-MSCs have many advantages. The iso￾lation process used to obtain MSCs from UC does not 
cause damage, and it allows for utilization of tissue that

might otherwise have been thrown away. It has been 
reported that the proliferation ability of UC-MSCs is 
much higher than that of BM-MSCs, [36] which fulfills 
the need for the large quantities required in the clinic. UC 
is at an early phase of organic development, so UC-MSCs 
show higher self-renewal and differentiation capacity 
[37]. Thus, there is no need to be concerned about age￾related issues. On the other hand, UC-MSCs are better 
for liver failure treatment because of higher differentia￾tion capacity. In addition, it has been demonstrated that 
the immunogenicity of UC-MSCs is lower than that of 
BM-MSCs [38, 39]. Thus, for patients with liver trans￾plantation, autologous BM-MSCs and allogenic UC￾MSCs are more appropriate. Adipose tissue is also easy to 
obtain, and the isolation method is very simple. However, 
AD-MSCs have been shown to have poor proliferation 
and self-renewal ability. Their anti-inflammatory ability 
is lower than that of BM-MSCs [40]. In conclusion, UC￾MSCs are a prominent and preferred candidate for clini￾cal application.
During clinical treatment, the choice between autolo￾gous or allogeneic transplantation is a source of confu￾sion for doctors. For autologous transplantation, the type 
and amounts of MSC-derived tissues are very limited. 
Therefore, it will take a long time to obtain a sufficient 
number of MSCs for transplantation. The wait for cells 
might cause doctors to miss the window for treatment 
for liver diseases such as liver failure and acute liver fail￾ure. Obviously, the process of obtaining tissue also causes 
injury to patients. On the other hand, due to their lower 
immunogenicity, allogeneic MSCs can be injected with￾out rejection risk, and an enough MSCs can be obtained 
very quickly. We can also choose the MSCs with the best 
properties. Therefore, allogeneic MSCs may be much 
better than autologous MSCs.
Routes of MSC transplantation
In clinical trials, MSCs have been transplanted into 
patients via various available routes; most are trans￾planted by intravenous injection, followed by intrahe￾patic injection (including via the portal vein and hepatic 
artery), and the least used method is intrasplenic injec￾tion (Fig. 3b). Which route is the best and most beneficial 
for therapy? How can the best route be chosen from all 
routes? It is indeed necessary to explore this question.
There are only a few completed clinical trials that have 
used multiple infusion routes simultaneously. In one 
clinical trial that used BM-MSCs to treat end-stage liver 
failure that was performed in Egypt, MSCs were injected 
into patients by the portal vein and intrasplenic injec￾tion, and the effects of these two injection routes for 
6 months after transplantation were compared [17]. As a 
result, it was found that portal vein injection was more 
effective than intrasplenic injection, as indicated by the 
fatigue impact scale and MELD score. However, this 
effect was observed only in the first month, and the dif￾ference disappeared in the following days. This suggests 
that portal injection favors faster engraftment of injected 
cells but does not affect the total number of engrafted 
cells. Splenic injection is much easier than intrahepatic 
injection technically. However, we need to consider the 
complications induced by intrasplenic injection. Seventy 
percent of patients with intrasplenic injection had fever 
after cell transplantation, and 30% of patients had fever 
after intrahepatic injection. Thus, we prefer portal vein 
injection between these two injection routes.
Apart from portal vein injection, the hepatic artery can 
be used for intrahepatic injection. Hepatic artery injec￾tion is used more often than portal vein injection dur￾ing MSC transplantation in clinical trials. However, is 
hepatic artery injection better than portal vein injection? 
Sang et al. concluded that intraportal injection was better 
for repairing liver injury in swine with ALF than hepatic 
intra-arterial injection, peripheral intravenous injection 
and in  situ intrahepatic injection, as indicated by the 
increase in survival time and the decrease in liver injury 
[41]. Another study showed that transplantation via the 
hepatic artery was not beneficial for the transdifferentia￾tion of MSCs.
Intravenous injection is the most popular route for 
clinical therapy because of its convenience. Is it the opti￾mal method for cell transplantation? We must look for 
evidence from preclinical trials because there are no 
clinical trials comparing the effectiveness of intravenous 
injection and other routes. Animal studies have shown 
that cells transplanted via intravenous injection will accu￾mulate in the lung. E. Eggenhofer demonstrated that in 
the first few hours, 60% of MSCs injected intravenously 
accumulated in the lungs and did not move to the liver 
afterward. These cells were probably cleared by immune 
cells [42]. Higashimoto et  al. [43] showed that, after 
intravenous injection in mice with ConA induced hepa￾titis, GFP-labeled MSCs were found only in the lung but 
not in the liver. Cao et al. [44] determined that intrapor￾tal injection of MSCs restored hepatic function in ALF 
pigs, while transplantation of MSCs via the jugular vein 
did not. Li et  al. [45] also administered MSCs via the 
peripheral vein and intraportal route into ALF pigs. They 
reported that the injection of MSCs via a peripheral vein 
did not rescue ALF pigs, while most of the ALF pigs sur￾vived for over 6 months after transplantation of MSCs via 
intraportal injection.
Intraportal injection is obviously the optimal route 
for MSC transplantation to treat liver diseases because 
of faster engraftment and the avoidance of off-target 
accumulation. In fact, we must evaluate the condition of 

Yang et al. Cell Biosci (2020) 10:123 Page 10 of 18
patients and the potential risk of using a specific route 
before choosing the injection route. For instance, we need 
to know if there is thrombosis in the portal vein or tech￾nical issues. If there are difficulties involved in intraportal 
injection, intrasplenic injection or intravenous injection 
is probably a widely accepted  alternative  approach, and 
more MSCs are suggested to be prepared.
Doses used for MSC transplantation
The doses of MSCs applied in clinical therapy were not 
exact. It is very difficult to assess an optimal dosing 
strategy for MSC transplantation because most of the 
recent clinical trials were aimed at observing the effi￾ciency of MSC therapy but did not determine the opti￾mal dose. Even so, we can still provide some guidance 
based on these clinical trials. Most clinical trials apply 
MSCs according to the body weight of patients (n=9, 
0.5–3×106
/kg as a single dose), while others apply MSCs 
according to the total quantity of cells (n=7, 1–20×107
). 
According to other medicine dosing strategies, injection 
according to body weight may be more reasonable. An 
Egypt study in 2013 involving transplanting MSCs into 
patients with liver cirrhosis showed that as few as 1×107
MSCs were effective for 6  months without any side 
effects [46]. In the same year, another study used MSCs 
in patients with liver cirrhosis and found that 2×108
MSCs showed no significant effect after 12 months com￾pared with placebo [8]. However, there are other effec￾tive clinical trials that used more than 2×108
 MSCs. It 
is important to bear in mind that we cannot draw a con￾clusion from different trials. There are other parameters 
involved in this process, such as the condition of patients, 
progression of diseases and treatment regimens. Among 
the recent clinical trials involving applying MSCs to 
treat liver diseases, the total number of MSCs used was 
from~107
−  ~109
, regardless of which method was cho￾sen to deliver the dose. The large range of doses used is 
hard to explain because there are few studies involving 
comparisons of different doses in the same clinical trial. 
However, we know that as few as 1×107
 cells can be 
helpful.
Most completed clinical trials injected MSCs only 
once, and others injected MSCs multiple times, with 
up to 9 injections in one experiment [ClinicalTrials.gov
NCT02223897]. How long would one dose of MSCs be 
effective? Is it necessary to inject MSCs several times? 
One study that used MSCs for liver cirrhosis treatment 
showed that MSCs could improve liver function over two 
years. No difference was observed between the control 
group and MSC group after two years [17]. As a result, 
the effect of one injection will not last that long. How￾ever, another clinical trial involving treatment for liver 
cirrhosis showed that there was no significant difference 
between the effect of one or two injections during a year 
[10]. This is probably because the second injection was 
performed only one month after the first injection. From 
these two studies, we can conclude that a longer interval 
for the second injection is probably beneficial for improv￾ing the therapeutic efficiency of MSCs.
Mechanism of MSC therapy for liver disease
In order to elucidate how MSCs play a positive role in the 
treatment of the above-mentioned liver diseases, we pre￾sent the current findings regarding the molecular mecha￾nism involved in the MSC-dependent modulation of liver 
diseases via a brief overview. A large number of stud￾ies have reported that MSC transplantation could pro￾mote partial recovery of liver function and alleviate liver 
inflammation in several animal models of liver fibrosis 
or cirrhosis. The mechanisms of the effects of MSCs on 
treating liver diseases have been evaluated from various 
perspectives in basic studies.
Immunomodulation capacity of MSCs
Most previous studies have shown that MSCs could 
improve or repair injured tissue by modulating tissue 
immune responses through direct cell-to-cell interaction 
or paracrine secretion. MSCs could modulate innate and 
adaptive immune responses.
The induction of CD4+CD25+FoxP3+  regulatory T 
cells (Tregs) is critical for MSC-mediated immunomod￾ulation. Previous studies indicated that an imbalance in 
Treg/Th17 cells may be associated with liver diseases, 
such as autoimmune hepatitis, chronic hepatitis B, and 
alcoholic liver disease. A random trial reported that com￾pared with those in the control group, the serum levels 
of interleukin-17 (IL-17), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF￾α), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were significantly lower in 
the transplantation group. Furthermore, a significant 
increase in Tregs and a marked decrease in Th17 cells 
were observed in the transplantation group, indicat￾ing that BM-MSCs exhibit potent immunosuppressive 
and anti-inflammatory effects through the regulation of 
serum levels of inflammatory cytokines [6]. In line with 
the above study, Shi et al. [19] reported a pilot study using 
MSCs for treating liver transplant recipients. The data 
showed that after MSC infusion, Tregs in the liver were 
upregulated, whereas Th17 cells were downregulated. 
They also found that the percentage of HLA-DR+ CD4+
T cells was significantly decreased after UC-MSC infu￾sions, which may facilitate the suppression of alloreac￾tive responses. To date, only a few clinical protocols have 
included ex  vivo immunologic studies to gain insight 
into the mechanistic effects of MSC therapy in liver dis￾ease. There is an increasingly large body of work that 
supports the immunoregulatory capacity of transferred 

Yang et al. Cell Biosci (2020) 10:123 Page 11 of 18
MSCs in rodent models of liver disease. In nonclini￾cal experiments, several different molecules secreted by 
MSCs have been reported to have an immunomodula￾tory effect on T cell activities, including inducible nitric 
oxide synthase (iNOS), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), 
prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and transforming growth fac￾tor (TGF)-β [47, 48]. Another study demonstrated that 
MSCs can secrete matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), 
such as MMP-2 and MMP-9, that suppress T cell activa￾tion by cleaving surface CD25 molecules on T cells [49]. 
Furthermore, MSCs have also been shown to promote 
the generation and development of Tregs by secreting 
TGF-β. Of note, TGF-β is a two-edged sword in that it 
has immunosuppressive effects that alleviate liver inflam￾mation [50] but can also promote the progression of liver 
fibrosis [51, 52].
In addition, MSCs are reported to exhibit immu￾nomodulatory effects in macrophages, which play a cen￾tral role in both fibrosis and fibrotic resolution in the 
liver. Watanabe et al. found that MSCs could change the 
polarity of macrophages toward an M2 anti-inflamma￾tory phenotype, which involves the secretion of various 
anti-inflammatory factors, including chemokine ligand 
1 (CCL-1) and IL-10, increases the production of matrix 
metalloproteinases to decrease ECM, and increases the 
phagocytosis of hepatocyte debris (during this process, 
macrophages increase the levels of pro-regenerative fac￾tors) [53]. Similar to the above study, murine adipose￾derived MSCs were found to significantly increase the 
proportion of M2-like cells by increasing the production 
of IL-10 and arginase 1 activity [54]. In a mouse model 
of ischemia/reperfusion (IR)-induced  sterile inflamma￾tory injury of the liver, we found that adoptive transfer of 
MSCs reduced hepatocellular damage and shifted  mac￾rophage  polarization from the M1 to M2 phenotype by 
increasing YAP and β-catenin nuclear translation in mac￾rophages. Further research found that MSCs enhance the 
activity of the macrophage Hippo pathway, which in turn 
controls NLRP3 activation through a direct interaction 
between YAP and β-catenin and regulates XBP1-medi￾ated NLRP3 activation, leading to reprogramming  of 
macrophage  polarization toward an anti-inflammatory 
M2 phenotype [55].
Direct and indirect effects of MSCs on the fate of activated 
HSCs
Inflammation and fibrosis have a very close relation￾ship in liver disease. When the liver is damaged, quies￾cent hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) transdifferentiate into 
proliferative myofibroblastic/activated HSCs, which 
are the main contributors to liver fibrosis. Investigators 
have tried to determine the methods by which MSCs 
may influence the fate of myofibroblasts/activated HSCs. 
Reported hypotheses include a direct effect by cell–cell 
contact and MSC-secreted cytokines/growth factors 
or an indirect effect by cellular mediators, such as mac￾rophages or even hepatocytes. Regarding the indirect 
effects, MSCs can regulate the activities of HSCs by 
modulating immune cell activity. For example, MSCs can 
induce changes in the cytokine profile of activated mac￾rophages by increasing the production of IL-10, PGE2 
and matrix metalloproteinases and thereby promote 
the resolution of fibrosis [56]. On the other hand, MSCs 
can degrade ECM directly by secreting matrix metallo￾proteinases, such as MMP-13 and MMP-9 [57]. In vitro 
experiments have also demonstrated that after coculture 
with MSCs, the proliferation and activation of HSCs was 
inhibited by ADSCs, and the apoptosis of HSCs was pro￾moted [58, 59]. Furthermore, a recent study reported that 
tumor necrosis factor-inducible gene 6 protein (TSG￾6), a cytokine released from MSCs, could suppress HSC 
activation and induce the expression of stem cell mark￾ers in these cells. Then, the stem cell-like cells derived 
from HSCs treated with TSG-6 can form organoids that 
contribute to liver regeneration [60]. The milk fat glob￾ule-EGF factor 8 (MFGE8) was identified by Su et al. [61] 
as a novel key antifibrotic factor based on its role in the 
modulation of TGF-β signaling. In an in vivo analysis of 
mice, hUC-MSC secretomes were injected into mice with 
fibrosis, which led to a significant inhibition of liver fibro￾sis. MFGE8 is an antifibrotic protein in MSC secretomes 
that strongly inhibits TGF-β signaling and reduces extra￾cellular matrix deposition and liver fibrosis in mice [62].
Differentiation of MSCs into Hepatocyte‑like Cells
A majority of in vitro studies demonstrated that MSCs 
had the capacity to differentiate into hepatocyte-like 
cells with liver-specific morphology and function 
with the help of specific growth factors, such as HGF, 
EGF, FGF, and OSM [63–66]. Furthermore, Yan et  al.
[67] showed that by mimicking the microenvironment 
of liver fibrosis using 50  g/L rat fibrotic liver tissue 
extracts, hUC-MSCs were stimulated to differentiate 
into hepatocyte-like cells in a shorter period of time. 
Similar results have been confirmed by in vivo experi￾ments. Interestingly, Park et  al. [68] previously trans￾planted human MSCs into rats with a fibrotic liver. 
Then, 21  days after transplantation, human albumin￾positive cells were detected in the MSC infusion group, 
which suggested that the transplanted MSCs could dif￾ferentiate into albumin-secreting hepatocyte-like cells 
in the damaged livers of the rats. In line with these 
findings, Zhang et al. [69] reported that the expression 
of human ALB, AFP, CK18 and CK19 were detected in 
the liver tissue of fibrotic and cirrhotic rats after hUC￾MSC transplantation, suggesting that transplanted 

Yang et al. Cell Biosci (2020) 10:123 Page 12 of 18
hUC-MSCs could migrate into the injured liver, where 
they could differentiate into hepatocyte-like cells. Fur￾thermore, they also demonstrated that hUC-MSCs did 
not directly differentiate into functional hepatocytes; 
they first differentiated into epithelial cell-like cells and 
subsequently differentiated into hepatocyte-like cells. 
All the above findings indicated that MSCs could dif￾ferentiate into hepatocyte-like cells through exposure 
to the liver fibrosis microenvironment both in  vitro 
and in  vivo. However, there are also many research 
reports that indicate that the trans-differentiation of 
MSCs into hepatocytes has rarely been observed (less 
than 1% of the total liver mass) in animal models after 
MSC infusion [70]. Similarly, menstrual blood-derived 
stem cells were demonstrated to improve liver func￾tion by eliminating collagen deposition and inhibiting 
proliferative HSCs via paracrine mediators, but few of 
the transplanted cells were found to differentiate into 
functional hepatocyte-like cells [71]. Based on the 
above studies, MSCs are believed to exhibit a positive 
treatment effect in two ways: directly by cell differenti￾ation and indirectly by paracrine effects. Many studies 
have attempted to use exosomes or culture superna￾tants of MSCs to achieve therapeutic effects [72–74], 
indicating that the success of MSC therapy does not 
completely correlate with the efficiency of cell engraft￾ment and replacement. For treatment, it is likely that 
the paracrine effects of MSCs play a more vital role. 
Furthermore, we believe that in some cases, alternative 
treatments, such as MSC exosomes or MSC culture 
supernatant therapy, may be more effective than treat￾ment with MSCs themselves, as MSCs have robust 
plasticity, differentiation characteristics and immu￾nomodulatory properties. Infusion of MSCs in differ￾ent microenvironmental conditions may change their 
immunoregulatory characteristics, thereby affecting 
the stability of their therapeutic effects.
In conclusion, the treatment mechanisms mentioned 
above do not necessarily appear in the process of treat￾ing the same disease at the same time. According to 
the basic characteristics of different liver diseases, the 
role of MSCs in the treatment process may be focusing 
effect. For example, in applying for treatment inflam￾mation related liver disease, such as hepatitis induced 
cirrhosis or complications of liver transplantation, 
the immunomodulatory function of MSCs may play a 
more vital role. However, for liver cirrhosis, the effects 
of MSCs on the fate of activated HSCs may also take 
part in the treatment process. In another hand, the 
efficacy of MSCs treatment in liver failure may mainly 
depend on its property of differentiation into hepato￾cyte-like cells.
Modification of MSCs for therapy
Conventional unmanipulated MSCs have been the main￾stay of therapeutic studies, and more efforts need to be 
made to enhance their efficacy. In fact, priming of MSCs 
before use is intended to enhance their biological prop￾erties and function in some animal models. This may 
involve the combination of MSCs with other factors, pre￾treatment and genetic modification of MSCs, and the use 
of secretomes of MSCs.
Pretreatment of MSCs
Pretreatment of MSCs may improve their potential to 
treat liver diseases by increasing their homing, differen￾tiation and immunoregulation capacity. Pretreatment of 
MSCs with zeaxanthin dipalmitate (ZD) could increase 
the cell survival rate and enhance the capacity of MSCs to 
differentiate into hepatocytes. In addition, ZD-pretreated 
MSCs ameliorated liver injury to a great extent [75]. The 
anti-inflammatory property of MSCs could be modulated 
by the inflammatory microenvironment. Thus, pretreat￾ment with inflammatory factors such as TNF-α com￾bined with IFN-γ may promote the anti-inflammatory 
ability of MSCs and shorten the functioning time in vivo 
[76]. However, the anti-inflammatory effect of MSCs 
is probably repressed after differentiation. Should we 
enhance the differentiation ability or immune regulation 
ability of MSCs by priming? This may depend on the spe￾cific disease type. In addition to MSC priming, the pre￾treatment of MSC recipients also exerted a similar effect 
in  vivo. Pretreatment of recipients with both anti-PMN 
[77] and IL-1β siRNA [78] could promote the therapeu￾tic efficacy of MSCs. Dexamethasone has been dem￾onstrated to repress the repair capacity of MSCs [79]. 
Thus, dexamethasone should be withdrawn before MSC 
administration.
Genetic modification of MSCs
In addition to MSC pretreatment, genetic modifica￾tion of MSCs may be another powerful approach for 
disease therapy. To date, there have been many genetic 
modifications targeting MSC therapy in animal mod￾els. Both c-Met [80] and CXCR4 [81] overexpression 
could enhance the migration and engraftment of MSCs 
into injured sites and thus promote liver injury repair. 
In addition to showing the enhancement of homing, 
IGF-1-modified MSCs were found to have an enhanced 
anti-fibrotic ability compared to normal MSCs [82]. In 
fact, a large proportion of gene modifications of MSCs 
have been applied in liver cancer treatment. MSCs 
can deliver cytokines, such as IFN-β [83, 84], IFN-α2b 
[85], tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis induc￾ing ligand (TRAIL) [86, 87] and IL-12 [88], to inhibit 

Yang et al. Cell Biosci (2020) 10:123 Page 13 of 18
hepatocarcinogenesis. MSCs also deliver the immune 
effector molecule CD3scfv to stimulate antitumor immu￾nity [89]. In addition, MSCs can deliver the suicide gene 
HSV-Tk to induce cytotoxicity in hepatoma cells [90]. 
Overall, MSC-delivered cytokines could be more sta￾ble and longer lasting than pure cytokines and produce 
reduced side effects. Moreover, the use of genetically 
modified MSCs would be more safe than transfecting 
viruses directly into the body. However, considering the 
potential of MSCs to promote tumor growth, a safety 
evaluation should be carried out strictly before clinical 
application.
Cell‑free therapy with MSCs
The status of transplanted cells in vivo and the potential 
tumorigenic risks of MSCs have raised concerns about 
their effectiveness and safety. MSCs have been shown 
to exert their anti-inflammatory and tissue repair func￾tions through the paracrine effects of cytokines and other 
secretomes. As a result, increasing evidence has con￾firmed the efficacy of conditioned medium (CM) and 
exosomes of MSCs in animal models of liver disease. 
MSC-CM exerts anti-inflammatory functions via pro￾duction of anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-10, 
IL-13, and IL-27 [91], and contributes to the expansion of 
immune-suppressive T cells (Tregs) [92]. MSC-CM also 
restored liver function by promoting hepatocyte pro￾liferation and inhibiting hepatocyte apoptosis through 
HGF and VEGF secretion [93]. Moreover, Li et  al. [72] 
found that UC-MSC-derived exosomes inhibited liver 
fibrosis by repressing EMT of hepatocytes and collagen 
production in a mouse model. Exosomes also inactivate 
the TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway, which is involved 
in fibrogenesis. On the other hand, miRNAs in exosomes 
contribute to inhibiting fibrosis formation [94]. Thus, 
the use of the MSC secretome as an acellular therapeu￾tic agent could provide several advantages over the use of 
cell-based therapies for liver diseases.
Prospective of clinical application of MSCs
MSC therapy has been generally regarded as a safe and 
promising therapeutic strategy in clinical trials for 
patients with liver disease, including complications due 
to liver transplantation, liver failure, cirrhosis due to alco￾hol, HBV, or HCV, and primary biliary cholangitis. How￾ever, the application of MSCs for the treatment of related 
diseases has not been approved by official agencies such 
as the FDA, and this therapeutic strategy has not been as 
popular as expected. We speculate that this is probably 
because there are still some vital problems that have not 
been solved in the application of MSC therapy (Fig.  4). 
In addition, the inconsistency and ambiguity of MSCs as 
a type of stem cells may be one of the main reasons for 
the limited application of MSCs. The creator of the term 
"MSC", Arnold Caplan, recommended using "Medicinal 
Signaling Cells" instead of "Mesenchymal stem cells" to 
best describe these cells [95]. MSCs have been found as 
stem cells at first because of their self-renewal and multi￾differentiation. However, their application will be greatly 
limited if we treat MSCs only as stem cells. MSCs also 
have some properties beyond stemness, such as migrat￾ing to injury sites and immunoregulation. These prop￾erties are important for liver disease therapy. Balancing 
different views of using MSCs as stem cells or other cell 
type will improve application of MSCs in liver disease 
therapy.
First, it is important to maintain the quality and stabil￾ity of MSCs used for disease therapy. Based on the clini￾cal trials mentioned above, there is no uniform standard 
for evaluating the quality of MSCs in each trial. The char￾acteristics of MSCs from autologous bone marrow from 
different patients are likely to be quite different due to 
the diversity of factors such as patient age, gender, dis￾ease status, and other factors. For instance, a researcher 
in Brazil reported that MSCs isolated from multiple scle￾rosis patients have distinct gene expression profiles and 
functional defects implicated in MSC immunomodula￾tory and immunosuppressive activity compared with 
those from their healthy counterparts [96]. Another 
group also demonstrated that MSCs derived from hepa￾titis B patients proliferated slowly and tended to undergo 
senescence [97]. Therefore, we believe that the establish￾ment of a complete MSC quality standard evaluation sys￾tem is needed. Based on such a standard, we can know 
which MSCs from autologous patients are qualified or 
meet the standards and which should be eliminated and 
replaced with allogenic MSCs for treatment.
For the treatment of disease, the optimal dose of 
MSCs and the number of infusions is not well defined. 
To date, a very few articles have examined how many 
doses of MSCs could produce the best effect and 
whether transplanting more MSCs results in a better 
treatment effect. Therefore, we also have no idea what 
the optimal number of injections and interval times 
would be. By integrating data from the different clinical 
trials mentioned above, we believe that MSCs should 
be effective when the number of administered MSCs is 
within a certain range. Freshly isolated MSCs showed 
better homing than cultured cells [98]. Thus, the most 
suitable dose should be determined based on balanc￾ing the corresponding therapeutic effect and the time 
and economic costs required to obtain the correspond￾ing dose of MSCs. Furthermore, as we mentioned in the 
third part of the review, it is not effective to perform 
multiple repeated MSC injections in a short period of 
time, such as within 6 months. In conclusion, low doses 

Yang et al. Cell Biosci (2020) 10:123 Page 14 of 18
and multiple injections with longer intervals are proba￾bly the most effective and economical strategy for MSC 
application.
Judging from the large number of in  vivo studies of 
MSCs, regardless of whether MSCs were obtained from 
autologous or allogenic sources or from bone mar￾row, umbilical cord or fat, MSC therapy did not cause 
serious adverse reactions, tumor formation or trans￾plant-related deaths in clinical trials. Thus, the source 
of MSCs that should be used depends on the specific 
situation. For instance, allogeneic MSCs, compared 
with autologous MSCs, have more potential advantages 
for the treatment of ACLF. Because a characteristic 
of ACLF is its rapid progression, the use of allogeneic 
MSCs may be preferred because of their immediate 
availability, while it always needs to take longer time 
for culturing autologous MSCs to obtain a sufficient 
quantity.
Of note, another central issue for the future success of 
cell transplantation is the ability to noninvasively assess 
the fate, migration patterns, and survival of trans￾planted cells. If we can track the fate of the transplanted 
MSCs, we could know the proportion of cells that home 
in and engraft in the liver and the way that cells exert 
their therapeutic effects. The classic method of MSCs 
labelling uses retroviral vectors to express fluorescent 
protein or gene-modified animal models to track MSCs 
in vivo [99, 100]. However, the visualization of cells that 
home in in different organs requires sacrificing of the 
animal, as the tissue penetrability of fluorescence is

Yang et al. Cell Biosci (2020) 10:123 Page 15 of 18
limited. Therefore, these technologies are not suitable 
for clinical applications. More noninvasive techniques 
have been employed constantly. Endomicroscopy was 
reported as a clinically available noninvasive cellular 
tracking method used to track cell fate in  vivo [101]. 
Furthermore, cellular magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) using fluorine- or iron-based nanoemulsions is 
also regarded as a great means to detect transplanted 
cells in vivo because of its high specificity and precise 
quantification [102, 103]. However, the potential limita￾tions of these tracking tools are the possibility of trans￾ferring the label to local bystander cells and the effect 
of the label on MSC basic feature. More advanced and 
improved technology for transplanted cell tracking 
needs to be employed.
Conclusions
According to clinical trials, MSC therapy has been 
regarded as a safe and promising therapeutic strategy for 
patients with end-stage liver disease, including liver cir￾rhosis, liver failure, and complications after liver trans￾plantation. However, for MSCs to become a routine 
treatment for these liver diseases and to be widely used, 
further studies with larger samples and double-blind con￾trolled trials are needed to increase the safety and effi￾cacy of MSCs in the clinic. Furthermore, studies on the 
optimal MSC transplantation route, minimum effective 
number of MSCs, and tracking of MSCs are needed to 
provide more references and guidance for specific future 
clinical treatment programs. In addition to the use of 
conventional unmanipulated MSCs, derived MSC thera￾pies, such as the use of primed MSCs or gene-modified 
MSCs or cell-free therapy, may be promising and practi￾cal treatments in the future.
