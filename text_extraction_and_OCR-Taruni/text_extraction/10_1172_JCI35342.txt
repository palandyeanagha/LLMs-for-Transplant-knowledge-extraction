A fraction of liver transplant recipients are able to discontinue all immunosuppressive therapies without
rejecting their grafts and are said to be operationally tolerant to the transplant. However, accurate identifica￾tion of these recipients remains a challenge. To design a clinically applicable molecular test of operational
tolerance in liver transplantation, we studied transcriptional patterns in the peripheral blood of 80 liver trans￾plant recipients and 16 nontransplanted healthy individuals by employing oligonucleotide microarrays and
quantitative real-time PCR. This resulted in the discovery and validation of several gene signatures comprising
a modest number of genes capable ofidentifying tolerant and nontolerant recipients with high accuracy. Mul￾tiple peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets contributed to the tolerance-associated transcriptional patterns,
although NK and γδTCR+ T cells exerted the predominant influence. These data suggest that transcriptional
profiling of peripheral blood can be employed to identify liver transplant recipients who can discontinue
immunosuppressive therapy and that innate immune cells are likely to play a major role in the maintenance
of operational tolerance in liver transplantation.
Introduction
Maintenance of a normal allograft function despite complete
discontinuation of all immunosuppressive drugs is occasionally
reported in clinical organ transplantation, particularly following
livertransplantation (1–9). Patientsspontaneously accepting their
grafts are conventionally considered as “operationally” tolerant
and provide a proof of concept that immunological tolerance can
actually be attained in humans. We and others have documented
differences in the phenotype and gene expression of PBMCs
obtained from operationally tolerant liver recipients as compared
with patients requiring ongoing pharmacological immunosup￾pression (10–12). While these observations have provided valu￾able information on the cellular and molecular basis of human
operational tolerance, the translation of this information into a
clinically applicable molecular diagnostic test capable of identify￾ing tolerance remains a challenge. In the current study, we have
employed gene-expression profiling technologies to construct
and validate a series of genomic classifiers of operational toler￾ance in liver transplantation. Thus, we have analyzed peripheral
blood specimensfrom 38 adult livertransplantrecipients employ￾ing oligonucleotide microarrays and quantitative real-time PCR
(qPCR) and have identified several predictive models containing
very low numbers of genes whose mRNA levels accurately identify
operationally tolerant liver recipients. This genomic footprint of
operational tolerance has been compared with gene-expression
patterns obtained from healthy individuals, validated in an inde￾pendent cohort of 23 additional liver recipients, and employed to
estimate the prevalence of tolerance among stable liver transplant
recipients receiving maintenance immunosuppressive drugs (STA
recipients). In addition, the influence of potentially confounding
clinical variables and specific PBMC subsets on tolerance-related
gene signatures has been thoroughly assessed. Our data suggest
that measurement of the expression of a modest number of genes
in peripheral blood could constitute a robust noninvasive diagnos￾tic test of operational tolerance in clinical liver transplantation.
Results
Candidate gene discovery and internal validation of microarray data. To
assess differential gene expression between tolerant and nontol￾erant recipients, oligonucleotide microarray experiments were
conducted on PBMCs obtained from 17 tolerant liver transplant
(TOL) and 21 nontolerant liver transplant (non-TOL) recipients
(Table 1 and Figure 1). An initial comparative statistical analysis
employing significant analysis of microarrays(SAM) yielded a total
of 2,482 probes (corresponding to 1,932 genes and 147 expressed
sequence tags) with a false discovery rate (FDR) of less than 5%
(Figure 2). To identify the minimal set of genes capable of predict￾ing the tolerantstate, predictive analysis of microarrays(PAM) was
performed in parallel on the same 2 groups of samples, resulting
in the identification of a subset of 26 probes corresponding to 24
genes (all of them present in the SAM list; Figure 3A) capable of
correctly classifying tolerant recipients, with an overall error rate

of 0.026 (sensitivity, 1; specificity, 0.944). Multidimensional scal￾ing analysis was then performed to visually represent the proxim￾ity between TOL and non-TOL samples according to the expres￾sion of the 26 probes. As depicted in Figure 3B, TOL and non-TOL
samples appeared as 2 clearly separated groups. Overall, analysis
of microarray-derived expression data results in the identification
of a genetic classifier that exhibits high accuracy in discriminating
TOL from non-TOL samples.
Prediction of tolerance in STA recipients under maintenance immu￾nosuppression employing microarray expression data. To estimate the
proportion of potentially tolerant individuals among STA recipi￾ents and thus externally validate the tolerance-related 26-probe
microarray signature, we employed PAM to classify a cohort of 19
STA patients under maintenance immunosuppressive therapy into
TOL and non-TOL categories. Tolerance was predicted in 26% of
cases. This rate ranged from 21% to 31% when 3 other prediction
algorithms, namely supervector machine learning using the ker￾nel radial basisfunction (SVM-rbf) or linear kernel (SVM-lin), and
K-nearest neighbors, were employed (data not shown). This esti￾mation is concordant with the rate of successful weaning we have
observed in similarly selected STA recipients (5, 8). Furthermore,
STA recipients identified as tolerant based on microarray expres￾sion patterns exhibited a higher proportion of peripheral blood
Vδ1TCR+ T cells and Vδ1/Vδ2 T cell ratios than those identified
as nontolerant recipients (Figure 4A), which is in agreement with
2 previous immunophenotyping studies (10, 11). Multidimen￾sional scaling was next employed to plot TOL, non-TOL, and STA
samplestogether based on the PAM-derived microarray expression
signature. Notably, STA samples were grouped together with TOL
or non-TOL samples in concordance with their predicted clinical
phenotype (Figure 4B).
Validation of microarray expression data by qPCR. We employed
qPCR to confirm the expression of the target genes identified by
microarrays and to compare the expression measurements obtained
from liver recipients with those from nontransplanted healthy
individuals (CONT). Selected target genes for qPCR experiments
included the 24 genes selected by PAM, 44 genes selected among
those most highly ranked in the SAM-derived gene list, and 6 genes
(UBD, HLA-DOB, FOXP3, LTBP3, MAN1A1, LGALS3) previously
reported to be associated with allograft tolerance (Table 2). Periph￾eral blood samplesfrom 16 TOL, 15 non-TOL, and 16 CONT indi￾viduals were employed for these experiments. TOL and non-TOL
samples differed in the expression of 34 genes (Table 3 and Fig￾ure 5A). Thirty genes were differentially expressed when assessed
by microarrays but not by qPCR. Among these, PCR primers
and microarray probes did not recognize the same transcripts in
11 cases. Hence, qPCR could confirm the differential expression
of 64% of the genesselected by microarrays. The reproducibility of
qPCR expression values was assessed by computing interpatient
and interassay variation. Interpatient variation (median SD of
ΔCt = 0.68) greatly exceeded interassay variation (median SD of
ΔCt = 0.21). This suggests that the variability of the qPCR is small
enough to reliably detect differences in gene expression between
TOL and non-TOL recipients. Although target genes had been
selected on account of their differential expression between TOL
and non-TOL samples, there were 26 genes differentially expressed
between TOL and CONT samples as well (Table 3 and Figure 5A).
The similarities between TOL, non-TOL, and CONT expression
patterns were then assessed in an unsupervised manner through
multidimensionalscaling analysis. Thisresulted in CONT samples
being clustered in between TOL and non-TOL groups(Figure 5B).
Taken together, qPCR expression results confirmed the validity of
most genes identified by microarrays and revealed that tolerance￾related expression patterns differ from those of both non-TOL
recipients and nontransplanted healthy individuals. Expression
patterns of TOL recipients, however, appear to be closer to those
of healthy individuals than to those of non-TOL recipients.
Prediction of tolerance in an independent validation test employing qPCR￾derived gene models. Among the candidate biomarkers identified in
qPCR experiments on the basis of their differential expression
between TOL and non-TOL samples, we searched for those that
would form optimal parsimonious models capable of predicting
tolerance statusin an independent validation set. This was accom￾plished by utilizing a novel classification modeling approach
based on the misclassified penalized posterior (MiPP) algorithm
and incorporating an independent cohort of 11 TOL and 12 non￾Table 1

TOL recipients not previously employed for data analysis and
from whom no microarray data were available. MiPP selected 3
signatures of 2, 6, and 7 genes (altogether comprising 12 different
genes), and these signatures were capable of correctly classifying
samplesincluded in both the training and validation sets(Table 3).
These experimentsindicate that qPCR can be employed on periph￾eral blood samplesto derive robust,reproducible, and highly accu￾rate gene models of liver operational tolerance.
Identification of clinical variables implicated in the tolerance-associated 
gene signature. We performed globaltest to assess the influence
of age, sex, type of immunosuppression, time from transplanta￾tion, peripheral blood leukocyte counts, and HCV infection sta￾tus on peripheral blood microarray gene-expression patterns. No
significant correlation was found between the tolerance-related
expression profile and patient age, sex, pharmacological immu￾nosuppression, and peripheral blood lymphocyte, neutrophil,
and monocyte numbers (data not shown). Time from transplan￾tation was marginally associated with the PAM-derived 26-probe
signature (P value < 0.042) but not with the 2,462-probe set iden￾tified by SAM. HCV infection, in contrast, had a major impact
both on global gene-expression patterns and on the tolerance￾related expression signatures (P < 0.0003 and P < 0.0033 for the
26- and the 2,462-probe sets, respectively). To further dissect the
effects of HCV infection on gene-expression patterns following
transplantation, we compared samples from chronically infected
patients(HCV-positive) with those of noninfected (HCV-negative)
recipients employing SAM. This resulted in the identification of
4,725 differentially expressed probes (FDR < 5%; data notshown).
Further, we used SAM to compare TOL and non-TOL samples
stratified on the basis of HCV infection status. HCV-negative
TOL and non-TOL individuals differed in 117 probes, while 528
probes were differentially expressed between HCV-positive TOL
and non-TOL recipients (FDR < 5%; Figure 6A). HCV infection
was also found to influence the expression of 12 out of the 26
probes included in the PAM-derived microarray genetic classifier,
although correlation was tighter with tolerance than with HCV
infection (Figure 6B). This is concordant with our finding that
the 26-probe set classifies TOL and non-TOL samples regardless
of HCV infection status (Figure 3B). Thus, while HCV infection
has a major influence on peripheral blood gene expression follow￾Figure 1
Study outline. Peripheral blood samples were obtained from a total of 80 liver transplant recipients and 16 healthy individuals. Samples from TOL 
and non-TOL recipients were separated into a training set (38 samples) and a test set (23 samples). Differential microarray gene expression 
between TOL and non-TOL samples in the training set was first estimated employing SAM. This was followed by a search to identify genetic 
classifiers for prediction employing PAM, which resulted in a 26-probe signature. The PAM-derived signature was then employed to estimate the 
prevalence of tolerance among a cohort of 19 STA recipients. Next, among the genes identified by SAM and PAM, 68 genes were selected for 
validation on a qPCR platform, and the 34 validated targets were employed to identify additional classifiers employing MiPP. The 3 signatures 
identified by MiPP on the qPCR data set were then used to classify samples in the independent test of 11 TOL and 12 non-TOL recipients. None 
of the samples from the test set were employed for the genetic classifier discovery process.

ing liver transplantation, this does not prevent accurate discrimi￾nation between TOL and non-TOL recipients.
PBMC subsets involved in the tolerance-related gene-expression footprint.
In a previous report (11), we investigated in detail the differences
in PBMC subsets between TOL and non-TOL liver recipients (this
report included 32 out of the 38 TOL and non-TOL recipients
incorporated in our current microarray study). TOL recipients
exhibited an increased number of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+, γδTCR+,
and δ1TCR+ T cells. In contrast, no differences were observed in
the frequency or absolute numbers of other T cell subsets, B, NK,
and NKT cells(11). To determine the contribution of these PBMC
subsets to tolerance-associated expression patterns, we employed

globaltest to correlate cell-subset frequencies with microarray￾derived expression levels. All 57 patients from whom microarray
data were available (including TOL, non-TOL, and STA recipients)
were employed for this study. First, we computed the number of
probes from the SAM-derived 2,482-probe list whose expression
correlated with the frequency of each specific PBMC subset. NK,
Vδ1TCR+, and total γδTCR+ T cells influenced 314, 296, and 438
probes, respectively, although statistical significance was only
reached for NK (P < 0.0032) and γδTCR+ T cells (P < 0.0271). For
comparison, a similar analysis was then conducted on the 4,725-
probe list differentiating HCV-positive from HCV-negative sam￾ples. This analysisidentified CD8+ T cells asthe lymphocyte subset
influencing the greatest number of genes, although this did not
reach statistical significance (328 probes; P < 0.14). NK, γδTCR+,
and Vδ1TCR+ peripheral blood lymphocyte proportions also cor￾related with the expression of multiple individual genes included
in the PAM-derived 26-probe set (Figure 6C), although only
γδTCR+ T cell frequency was shown to be significantly associ￾ated with the 26-probe set as a whole (P < 0.0154). The results
of these analyses indicate that both NK and γδTCR+ T cells
influence tolerance-associated peripheral blood expression
patterns. Considering that TOL and non-TOL recipients dif￾fer in the number of peripheral blood γδTCR+ T cells(11), it is
clearthat tolerance-related differential gene expression can be
attributed, at least in part, to an increased number of γδTCR+
T cells in TOL recipients. Regarding NK cells, which are pres￾ent in similar numbers in TOL and non-TOL recipients, we
hypothesized that the significant correlation observed might
be due to changes in their transcriptional program. To test
this hypothesis and further assess the contribution of other
PBMC subsets, we conducted qPCR experiments to measure
the expression of the 22 most significant genes from Table 3
on cell subsets sorted from a selected group of 5 TOL and
5 non-TOL patients. The set of 22 genes was predominantly
expressed by CD8+, γδTCR+, and non–T cell mononuclear cells
(Figure 7 and Table 4). Comparison of TOL and non-TOL
samples revealed significant expression differences in CD4+,
CD8+, γδTCR+, and non–T cell subsets (Figure 7 and Table 4).
In addition, protein levels of IL-2RB, KLRB1, CD244, CD9,
KLRF1, CD160, and SLAMF7 were assessed by flow cytometry
on CD4+, CD8+, γδTCR+ T, NK, CD19+, and NKT cells from
6 TOL, 6 non-TOL, and 5 healthy individuals. These proteins
were mainly expressed on NK, NKT, and γδTCR+ T cells, with
significant differences being noted between TOL, non-TOL,
and CONT individuals (Supplemental Figure 1, A and B;
supplemental material available online with this article;
doi:10.1172/JCI35342DS1). These findingsindicate that TOL
and non-TOL recipients differin the expression program ofseveral
PBMC subsets, mainly Vδ1TCR+ T cells and NK cells, and that in
many cases these expression changes are unique to the tolerant
state. Thus, tolerance-associated expression patterns appear to be
shaped both by differences in γδTCR+ T cell number and by func￾tional changes in a variety of PBMC subsets.
Discussion
We have previously reported that gene-expression profiling employ￾ing peripheral blood specimens and oligonucleotide microarrays
constitutes a high-throughput approach to dissect the biology
underlying operational tolerance in human liver transplantation
(11). The current study was designed to determine whether this
approach could be employed to identify genomic classifiers that
would (a) comprise modest numbers of genes, (b) provide high
diagnostic accuracy in the identification of tolerant recipients,
and (c) yield reproducible results across different transcriptional

platforms. We first analyzed peripheral blood samples obtained
from operationally tolerant liver recipients and from nontolerant
recipients requiring maintenance immunosuppression employ￾ing Affymetrix microarrays. The diagnostic applicability of the
resulting 26-probe genetic classifier was tested on an indepen￾dent cohort of 19 STA recipients. These patients were selected
according to the clinical criteria most commonly used to enroll
patients in immunosuppressive weaning trials (1) and are there￾fore representative of the diversity of patients to whom a diagnos￾tic test based on the identified gene signature would be applied if
adopted for broad clinical use. Prediction of tolerance status based
on the identified gene signature resulted in the identification of
4 of 19 potentially tolerant recipients (26%), which matches the
prevalence of operational tolerance observed in patients selected
according to the above clinical criteria (1, 5, 8). The most infor￾mative genes selected in the microarray experiments were then
validated on a qPCR platform. This resulted in the identification
of 3 qPCR-derived composite models incorporating 2–7 genes
exhibiting remarkable accuracy at discriminating TOL from non￾TOL samples in both training and independent validation sets.
qPCR experiments incorporated an additional group of samples
collected from healthy nontransplanted individuals(CONT). This
allowed comparison of TOL and CONT expression patterns. While
tolerance-related expression signatures resembled CONT more
than non-TOL patterns, half of the genes differentially expressed
between TOL and non-TOL samples were also significantly differ￾ent when comparing TOL and CONT samples. Thisindicatesthat
a substantial proportion of identified genetic classifiers are very
likely to be tolerance specific.
The potential impact on tolerance-related gene-expression pat￾terns of clinical variables such as age, time from transplantation,
type of immunosuppressive therapy, and HCV status was specifi￾cally addressed on the microarray dataset. HCV infection had a
striking impact on peripheral blood gene-expression patterns,
markedly outweighing the effect of tolerance itself in terms of the
number of genes influenced. The effect of HCV infection on the
set of genes most strongly associated with tolerance was, however,
weak, which explains why the 26-probe microarray signature could
correctly identify tolerant recipients regardless of HCV-infection
status. Time from transplantation was found to be marginally
associated with the PAM-derived 26-probe signature. This is con￾cordant with the clinical observation that liver recipients with a
longer posttransplant follow-up are more likely to become opera￾tionally tolerant (1) but clearly does not account for the expres￾sion differences between TOL and non-TOL recipients detected
in our study population. A significant effect of pharmacological
immunosuppression on tolerance-related gene-expression pat￾terns was excluded by the negative result of the globaltest asso￾ciation analysis and by our finding that STA recipients predicted
to be tolerant were grouped together with TOL recipients, which
suggests that a common expression signature prevails regardless
of the use of immunosuppressive drugs. Hence, we provide here

a series of robust predictive models containing a strikingly small
number of features capable of accurately discriminating between
operationally tolerant liverrecipients and those requiring ongoing
pharmacological immunosuppression on the basis of peripheral
blood gene-expression patterns.
The underlying biology of operational tolerance in humans is
still largely unknown. In the current work we have conducted a
whole genome gene-set analysis to gain unbiased insight into the
mechanisms of operational tolerance following liver transplanta￾tion (see Supplemental Data). This analysis has revealed that the
expression signature associated with operational liver allograft tol￾erance is mainly characterized by enrichmentin genes encoding for
a variety of NK cell–surface receptors expressed by NK, CD8+, and
γδTCR+ T cells. The influence of NK and γδTCR+ T cells on toler￾Table 3

ance-related expression patterns has been further confirmed by the
demonstration of a significant association between the expression
levels of the most informative genes and peripheral blood NK and
γδTCR+ T cell frequencies and by the finding that, in TOL recipi￾ents, both γδTCR+ and NK cells (together with other PBMC sub￾sets) exhibit unique expression markers. There are 2 main γδTCR+
T cellsubsetsin human peripheral blood: Vδ1 and Vδ2. In healthy
individuals, Vδ2TCR+ T cells largely predominate in peripheral
blood (>80%), while Vδ1TCR+ T cells are the major subtype in tis￾suessuch asintestine, liver, and spleen (13). In operationally toler￾ant liver recipients, in contrast, peripheral blood Vδ1TCR+ T cells
expand and typically outnumber Vδ2TCR+ T cells (10, 11). Our
current analysisindicatesthat Vδ1TCR+ T cells are the only γδTCR+
T cell subset clearly influencing tolerance-related transcriptional
signatures. In addition, we provide evidence that peripheral blood
Vδ1TCR+ T cells from tolerant liver recipients exhibit unique
expression and cell-surface traits that distinguish them from
those present in either nontolerant recipients or nontransplanted
healthy individuals. Vδ1TCR+ T cells have been reported to exert
immunoregulatory functions in a variety of nontransplantation
experimental and clinicalsettings(14–19). In livertransplantation,
further studies are needed to dissect the functional properties of
Vδ1TCR+ T cells and to determine whether these cells have direct
suppressive abilities on alloaggressive lymphocytes or act by pro￾Figure 6

ducing growth factors and repairing tissue damage, as has been
shown for the intestinal mucosa (18, 20–22).
On the basis of gene expression and flow cytometry data pre￾sented here, it is clear that tolerant liver recipients are distinct not
only from recipients requiring maintenance immunosuppression
but also from nontransplanted healthy individuals. This suggests
that in liver transplantation, achievement of operational toler￾ance is unlikely to be due to a “reinitialization” of the immune
system resulting in recognition of the transplanted graft as “self.”
On the contrary, tolerant liver recipients appear to have developed

tolerogenic pathways not readily detectable in peripheral blood
of healthy individuals but capable of ensuring the protection of
the liver allograft.
Functional profiling of human kidney allograft tolerance
employing peripheral blood samples has been previously reported
by Brouard et al. (23) utilizing a 2-color cDNA microarray platform
(lymphochip) mainly containing immune-related genes(24). While
it would be critical to find common features between operationally
tolerant kidney and liver recipients, comparison of both studies is
problematic. First, the 2 array platforms employed (lymphochip
and Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 arrays) have only 4,733 probes in
common, with just 543 of them being present in the SAM-derived
2,482-gene list discriminating between TOL and non-TOL liver
recipients(data obtained employing the MatchMinertool;ref. 25).
This number is very low for detailed evaluation of genome-wide
transcriptionalsimilitudes, particularly when comparing 2 distant
clinical settings and utilizing 2 different expression platforms.
Second, the 2 studies analyze different patient groups (i.e., our
study is focused on identifying tolerant individuals among STA
recipients while Brouard et al. compare tolerant kidney recipients
with chronic rejectors). Despite these limitations, a comparison
restricted to functional pathway profilessuggeststhat the mecha￾nisms accounting for operational tolerance in liver transplan￾tation are distinct from those active in kidney recipients. Thus,
operationally tolerant kidney recipients appear to be character￾ized by a state of immune quiescence with marked downregula￾tion of genes involved in lymphocyte trafficking and activation
and upregulation of genesresponsible for cell-cycle control (23). In
contrast, in operationally tolerant liver recipients, there is a mani￾fest influence on expression patterns of cellular components of the
innate immune cells while changes in proinflammatory pathways
are barely noticeable except for HCV-positive recipients.
Furthermore, a role for B cells in liver allograft toler￾ance is not supported by either immunophenotyping
or gene expression data, in contrast to what has been
reported in kidney transplantation (26, 27).
In short, our study reveals that measurement of the
expression levels of a small set of genes in peripheral
blood could be useful to accurately identify liver recipi￾ents who are able to accept their grafts in the absence
of pharmacological immunosuppression. Validation of
our findings in prospective immunosuppression wean￾ing trials would open the doorto the possibility of with￾drawing immunosuppressive drugs in recipients with
high likelihood of being tolerant. Further, functional
analysis of expression patterns suggests that molecular
pathways involved in the activation and effector func￾tion of innate immunity cell types (NK and γδTCR+
T cells) are central to the maintenance of operational
tolerance following liver transplantation. Altogether,
our work highlights the value of peripheral blood tran￾scriptional profiling in the immune monitoring of
liver transplantrecipients and providesinsight into the
pathogenesis of human allograft tolerance.
Methods
Patients. Peripheral blood samples were collected from a cohort
of 28 TOL recipients and 33 liver recipients in whom drug
weaning was attempted but led to acute rejection, requir￾ing reintroduction of immunosuppressive drugs (non-TOL).
TOL recipients had been intentionally weaned from immunosuppressive
therapy under medical supervision. Criteria employed in selecting patients
for immunosuppression weaning in the participating institutions were as
follows: (a) more than 3 years after transplantation; (b) single-drug immu￾nosuppression; (c) absence of acute rejection episodes in the previous
12 months; (d) absence ofsigns of acute/chronic rejection in liver histology;
and (e) absence of autoimmune liver disease before or aftertransplantation.
In TOL recipients, blood was collected more than 1 year after successful
immunosuppressive drug discontinuation, while in non-TOL recipients,
specimens were harvested more than 1 year after complete resolution of
the acute rejection episode (at the time of blood collection, all non-TOL
recipients had normalized liver function tests and were receiving low-dose
immunosuppression in monotherapy). Additionally, peripheral blood sam￾ples were also obtained from 16 age-matched healthy controls(CONT) and
19 STA recipientsthatfulfilled the aforementioned clinical criteria for drug
weaning. In patients fulfilling these criteria, the prevalence of operational
tolerance ranges between 20% and 30% (5, 8). Clinical and demographic
characteristics of patientsincluded in the study are summarized in Table 1.
The study was accepted by the Institutional Review Boards of all partici￾pating institutions, and informed consent was obtained from all patients.
A report containing blood-cell immunophenotyping findingstogetherwith
preliminary microarray gene expression data obtained from a subset of the
patients enrolled in the current study has been recently published (11).
Microarray experiments. Microarray experimentswere conducted on PBMCs
obtained from 21 non-TOL, 17 TOL, and 19 STA recipients. PBMCs were
isolated employing a Ficoll-Hypaque layer (Amersham Biosciences), total
RNA was extractedwith TRIzolreagent(Life Technologies), and the derived
cRNA sampleswere hybridized onto AffymetrixHuman Genome U133 Plus
2.0 arrays containing 54,675 probes for 47,000 transcripts (Affymetrix).
Sample handling and RNA extraction were performed by the same investi￾gator in all cases (M. Martínez-Llordella).

Microarray data normalization. Microarray data from 57 samples (21 non￾TOL, 17 TOL, and 19 STA) were normalized using the guanidine-cytosine
content-adjusted robust multiarray algorithm, which computes expression
valuesfrom probe-intensity valuesincorporating probe-sequence informa￾tion (28). Next, we employed a conservative probe-filtering step excluding
those probes not reaching a log2 expression value of 5 in at least 1 sample,
which resulted in the selection of a total of 23,782 probes out of the origi￾nal 54,675 set. In order to eliminate nonbiological experimental variation
or batch effects observed across successive batches of microarray experi￾ments, we applied ComBat approach, which uses nonparametric empirical
Bayes frameworks for data adjustment (29).
Differential expression assessment and prediction. An outline of the study
design is depicted in Figure 1. We first used SAM (30) to identify genes
differentially expressed between the TOL and non-TOL groups (17 and
21 samples, respectively) within the filtered 23,782-probe set. SAM uses
modified t test statistics for each gene of a dataset and a fudge factor to
compute the t value, thereby controlling for unrealistically low standard
deviations for each gene. Furthermore, SAM allows control of the FDR by
selecting a threshold for the difference between the actual test result and
the result obtained from repeated permutations of the tested groups. For
the current study, we employed SAM selection using FDR of less than 5%
and 1,000 permutations on 3 comparison groups: TOL versus non-TOL,
TOL HCV-positive versus non-TOL HCV-positive, and TOL HCV-negative
versus non-TOL HCV-negative. Differential gene expression was further
explored by using the nearestshrunken centroid classifierimplemented in
the PAM (31) package to identify within the 23,782-probe set the minimal
set of genes capable of predicting the tolerant state with an overall error
rate of lessthan 5%. This method incorporates an internal cross-validation
step during feature selection in which the model is fit on 90% of the sam￾ples and then the class of the remaining 10% is predicted. This procedure
isrepeated 10 timesto compute the overall error(10-fold cross-validation).
The PAM classifier was then used on the 38-sample set to perform mul￾tidimensional scaling analysis on the basis of between-sample Euclidean
distances as implemented by the isoMDS function in R. This method is
capable of visualizing high-dimensional data (such as multiple expression
measurements) in a 3D graph in which the distances between samples are
kept as unchanged as possible. Finally, the PAM classifier was employed to
predict classin the set of 19 samples obtained from STA patients. Detailed
information on the microarray expression dataset in available online
(http://bioinfo.ciberehd.org/asf/).
Correlation of microarray data with clinical variables and PBMC subsets. The
globaltest algorithm (32) from the Bioconductor package (http://bio￾conductor.wustl.edu/BioC2.1/bioc/html/globaltest.html) was employed
to determine whether potentially confounding clinical variables such as
patient age, sex, time from transplantation, HCV status, immunosuppres￾sive therapy (tacrolimus, cyclosporine A, or mycophenolate mophetil), and
peripheral blood monocyte, lymphocyte, and neutrophil counts could be
influencing gene-expression levels. The same strategy was employed to esti￾mate the correlation between microarray expression data and the propor￾tion of peripheral blood CD4+CD25+, CD4+Foxp3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD19+,
NKT, total γδTCR+, Vδ1TCR+, and Vδ2TCR+ T cells. Globaltest is a method
to determine whether the expression pattern of a prespecified group of
genesis related to a clinical variable, which can be either a discrete variable
or a continuous measurement. This test is based on an empirical Bayes￾ian generalized linear model, where the regression coefficients between
gene-expression data and clinical measurements are random variables. A
goodness-of-fit test is applied on the basis of this model. The globaltest
method computes a statistic Q and a P value to measure the influence of
our group of genes on the clinical variable measured. For each probe, the
influence (Q) in predicting measured clinical variable is estimated against
the expected value, and ranked among the probes understudy. The weight
of each probe is also assessed by the z-score considering the standard devia￾tion of each probe in all samples used in the analysis.
qPCR experiments. The expression pattern of a group of 68 target genes
and 4 housekeeping genes (18S, GUS, HPRT1, and GAPDH) was measured
by qPCR employing the ABI 7900 Sequence Detection System and LDA
microfluidic PCR cards(PE Applied Biosystems) on peripheral blood sam￾ples obtained from 15 non-TOL, 16 TOL, and 16 CONT individuals. Select￾ed target genes included the 24 genes identified by PAM, 44 genes selected
among those most highly ranked in the SAM-derived gene list, and 6 genes
(UBD, HLA-DOB, FOXP3, LTBP3, MAN1A1, LGALS3) selected on the basis
of previous reports (11, 23, 26, 33, 34). To quantify the levels of mRNA, we
normalized the expression of the target genes to the housekeeping gene
HPRT1 (which was found to be the most stably expressed gene among the
4 housekeeping genesselected) and presented the results asrelative expres￾sion between cDNA of the target samples and a calibrated sample accord￾ing to the ΔCt method. All qPCR experiments were performed in duplicate.
Total RNA wastreated with DNAse reagent (Ambion; Applied Biosystems),
and reverse transcription performed using Multiscribed Reverse Transcrip￾tase Enzyme (PE Applied Biosystems). Results were analyzed employing
standard 2-class unpaired t test. Reproducibility of gene expression mea￾surements was assessed by comparing interpatient and interassay variation
in a set of qPCR experiments that included 22 genes and samples from 16
recipients. Forthese experiments, 2 peripheral blood samples collected at 2
separated time points (mean, 57 days; range, 11–244 days) were employed.
Interassay variation was defined as the variation between PCR runs car￾ried out employing the 2 different peripheral blood samplesfrom the same
patient. To construct classification models containing a minimal set of
features (genes) with the lowest possible classification error both in train￾ing and independent test sets, we employed MiPP (35) on the 34 target
genes differentially expressed between TOL and non-TOL samples (t test;
P < 0.05). MiPP is a recently developed method for assessing the perfor￾mance of a prediction model that computesthe sum of the posterior classi￾fication probabilities penalized by the number of incorrectly classified sam￾ples. The MiPP application performs an exhaustive search for gene models
by sequentially selecting the most predictive genes and automatically
removing the selected genes in subsequent runs. For our analysis, we con￾ducted 10 sequentialruns and employed all predictive algorithmsincluded
in the MiPP application (linear discriminant analysis, quadratic discrimi￾nant analysis, support vector machine learning, and logistic regression).
Internal computational validation was performed employing both 10-fold
cross-validation and random-split validation (number of splits = 100).
The composite models obtained were then employed to predict tolerance
in the independenttestset of 11 TOL and 12 non-TOL samplesfrom which
no microarray data were available. The 3 models with a lower classification
error rate (in training set and test set) were selected.
Peripheral blood immunophenotyping. Flow cytometry immunophenotyping
data from PBMCs obtained from 16 TOL and 16 non-TOL recipients have
been reported elsewhere (11). In the currentstudy, we assessed the propor￾tion of CD4+CD25+, CD4+Foxp3+, total γδTCR+, δ1 γδTCR+, δ2 γδTCR+,
CD19+, NK, and NKT cellsubsets on peripheral blood specimens obtained
from 19 STA recipients and from 1 TOL and 5 non-TOL recipients (from
whom no previous data were available). Immunophenotyping resultsfrom
all 57 recipients were employed to correlate PBMC subset frequencies with
microarray expression data. Foxp3 fluorescent monoclonal antibodies
were purchased from eBioscience. Allremaining antibodies were purchased
from BD Biosciences.
Peripheral blood cell sorting experiments. Positive selection of CD4+, CD8+,
and γδTCR+ T cell subsets from Ficoll-isolated PBMCs was performed
employing Miltenyi magnetic beads according to the manufacturer’s

instructions. Purity of sorted cell populations was consistently greater
than 90%. Total RNA was extracted from CD4+, CD8+, γδTCR+, and
non–T mononuclear cell subsets employing TRIzol reagent, and gene
expression quantification was conducted employing qPCR as described.
Peripheral blood samples from 5 TOL and 5 non-TOL patients were
employed for these experiments.
Statistics. Two-tailed Student’s t test was employed to compare qPCR
gene expression levels and immunophenotyping data. Statistical signifi￾cance was defined as P < 0.05.
