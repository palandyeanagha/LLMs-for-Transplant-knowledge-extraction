Abstract
Background Percutaneous mitral valve repair (MVR) using the
MitraClip system has become a valid alternative for patients with
severe mitral regurgitation (MR) and high operative risk.
Objective To identify clinical and periprocedural factors that may
have an impact on clinical outcome.
Design Multi-centre longitudinal cohort study.
Setting Tertiary referral centres.
Patients Here we report on the first 100 consecutive patients
treated with percutaneous MVR in Switzerland between March
2009 and April 2011. All of them had moderate–severe (3+) or
severe (4+) MR, and 62% had functional MR. 82% of the patients
were in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III/IV, mean left
ventricular ejection fraction was 48% and the median European
System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation was 16.9%.
Interventions MitraClip implantation performed under
echocardiographic and fluoroscopic guidance in general
anaesthesia.
Main outcome measures Clinical, echocardiographic and
procedural data were prospectively collected.
Results Acute procedural success (APS, defined as successful clip
implantation with residual MR grade ≤2+) was achieved in 85%
of patients. Overall survival at 6 and 12 months was 89.9% (95% CI
81.8 to 94.6) and 84.6% (95% CI 74.7 to 91.0), respectively.
Univariate Cox regression analysis identified APS (p=0.0069) and
discharge MR grade (p=0.03) as significant predictors of survival.
Conclusions In our consecutive cohort of patients, APS was


achieved in 85%. APS and residual discharge MR grade are
important predictors of mid-term survival after percutaneous MVR.
