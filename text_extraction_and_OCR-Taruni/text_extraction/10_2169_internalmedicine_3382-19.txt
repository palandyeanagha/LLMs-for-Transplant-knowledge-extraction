Abstract:
Objective The influence of interferon (IFN)-free direct-acting antiviral (DAA) on hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC) recurrence remains unclear. Previous retrospective analyses revealed that the time interval between
HCC curative treatment and IFN-free DAA induction is the critical factor affecting HCC recurrence. Thus,
this study aimed to examine the influence of DAA therapy on HCC recurrence considering this interval.
Methods Factors contributing to HCC recurrence were retrospectively analyzed using a landmark time
analysis and time-dependent extended Cox proportional hazards model.
Patients After screening 620 patients who were diagnosed with primary HCC from January 2001 to De￾cember 2016, 76 patients with early-stage (primary and solitary) disease who received curative treatment and
were positive for serum hepatitis C virus RNA were included.
Results HCC recurrence was observed in 8 of 17 (47.1%) patients who had received IFN-free DAA therapy
and 45 of 59 (76.3%) who had not. No significant difference was seen between the IFN-free DAA (-) and
IFN-free DAA (+) groups in the landmark time and time-dependent Cox proportional hazards model analy￾ses. However, IFN-free DAA therapy tended to decrease the HCC recurrence rate after curative treatment for
primary HCC in patients with chronic hepatitis. In addition, IFN-free DAA therapy tended to decrease the
second HCC recurrence rate after treatment for the first HCC recurrence.
Conclusion Our results, with a consideration of the time interval between HCC curative treatment and IFN￾free DAA induction, showed that IFN-free DAA therapy was not associated with early-stage HCC recurrence
after curative treatment.

Introduction
Interferon (IFN)-free direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy
has replaced IFN as the standard treatment for hepatitis C
virus (HCV) infection based on its high efficacy and toler￾ability (1, 2). It has also been actively used after curative
treatment in patients with concurrent hepatocellular carci￾noma (HCC). It is well-characterized that chronic inflamma￾tion due to HCV infection accelerates hepatic fibrosis,
which promotes HCC development (3-5). Furthermore, sev￾eral molecular studies have shown that the presence of HCV
infection or HCV proteins themselves are involved in he￾patic carcinogenesis (6-8). Therefore, the elimination of

HCV by IFN-free DAA therapy is believed to suppress he￾patic carcinogenesis, and its use in patients with HCC to
prevent recurrence after curative treatment is acceptable.
However, a controversial Spanish study published in 2016
raised concerns that IFN-free DAA therapy may promote the
progression of HCC (9). Since this report, many studies
have investigated the influence of IFN-free DAA therapy on
HCC progression. Several systematic reviews and meta￾analyses have shown that IFN-free DAA therapy does not
affect HCC recurrence (10-13). In contrast, single-center
studies have shown that IFN-free DAA therapy may have
either promotive or suppressive effects on HCC recur￾rence (14-18). Thus, the studies reported to date present
conflicting data.
When investigating HCC recurrence, it is appropriate to
analyze the period from the time of curative treatment to re￾currence (19). However, several problems plague retrospec￾tive analyses on the effect of IFN-free DAA treatment on
HCC recurrence. First, various factors must be considered at
the primary HCC stage. Even after curative treatment, the
risk of HCC recurrence is thought to differ among patients
with single or multiple tumors and those with primary or re￾current tumors. Second, the interval between curative treat￾ment and IFN-free DAA therapy is different. HCC recur￾rence rates are believed to differ according to this
recurrence-free interval. When analyzing the effect of IFN￾free DAA treatment on HCC recurrence, it is necessary to
consider these factors and to adjust for them accordingly.
With the aforementioned gap in research, this study aimed
to delineate the effect of IFN-free DAA therapy on HCC re￾currence considering the above-mentioned factors. We lim￾ited the study to patients with primary and solitary HCC
curatively treated with surgery, radiofrequency ablation
(RFA), and stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT). Furthermore, to
adjust for differences in the recurrence-free interval, we used
a landmark time analysis and the time-dependent extended
Cox proportional hazards model to retrospectively analyze
the effect of IFN-free DAA therapy on HCC recur￾rence (20, 21).
Materials and Methods
Study design and subjects
This study was approved by the Graduate School of Na￾gasaki University’s Research Ethics Committee. Informed
consent was obtained from most of the study’s participants
in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and for
those from whom we did not have the opportunity to obtain
informed consent, the retrospective nature of the study en￾abled us to provide information about the research on the
hospital’s web page and to guarantee these patients the op￾tion to refuse participation in the research.
A total of 620 patients who were diagnosed with primary
HCC from January 2001 to December 2016 at the Depart￾ment of Gastroenterology and Hepatology in Nagasaki Uni￾versity Hospital were screened. The diagnosis of HCC was
based on the typical findings detected by ultrasonography
(US), dynamic computed tomography (CT), magnetic reso￾nance imaging (MRI), abdominal angiography, and/or bi￾opsy findings. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (i) pri￾mary and solitary HCC without metastasis and vessel inva￾sion, (ii) positivity for serum HCV RNA at treatment for
primary HCC, and (iii) primary HCC treated with surgery,
RFA, and SRT curatively. The exclusion criterion was a
follow-up period after curative treatment of <6 months.
Curative treatment with surgery was confirmed by find￾ings of resection with a comfortable margin and the absence
of HCC recurrence within six months after treatment. Cura￾tive treatment with RFA was confirmed by tumor findings
contained within the ablation area on either enhanced CT or
MRI at one to two weeks after treatment and the absence of
HCC recurrence within six months after treatment. Similarly,
curative treatment with SRT was confirmed by tumor find￾ings contained in the cautery region on enhanced CT or
MRI at three to six weeks after treatment and absence of
HCC recurrence within six months after treatment. HCC re￾currence was defined as the appearance of enhancement in
the arterial phase on either dynamic CT or MRI, and the
recurrence-free period was calculated based on the interval
between curative treatment and confirmation of recurrence
by imaging.
HCC recurrence was investigated by reviewing patients’
medical records up to August 2019. Underlying liver dis￾eases, such as chronic hepatitis (CH) and liver cirrhosis
(LC), were diagnosed comprehensively based on blood labo￾ratory examinations and US, CT, MRI, and endoscopy find￾ings. The Fib-4 index was calculated based on the blood ex￾amination data at the curative treatment for primary
HCC (22). The history of antiviral therapy after treatment
for primary HCC, including IFN-based and IFN-free DAA
therapy, was also extracted from the medical records. Anti￾HCV therapy was initiated based on the attending physi￾cians’ discretion. Regarding the components of the anti￾HCV therapy, IFN-based anti-HCV therapy was given until
August 2014, and IFN-free DAA therapy was given after
September 2014.
To determine the influence of IFN-free DAA therapy on
HCC recurrence, we compared the recurrence rate between
patients who received IFN-free DAA therapy and those who
did not. The factors contributing to HCC recurrence were
also examined.
Statistical analyses
To compare the patients’ baseline characteristics, categori￾cal data were summarized by the frequency and rate and
analyzed using Fisher’s exact test, whereas numerical data
were summarized by the median and analyzed using Wil￾coxon’s rank sum test.
To compare the recurrence rate after curative treatment in
the presence or absence of IFN-free DAA therapy, a land￾mark time analysis was conducted to adjust for the differ-

ence in the recurrence-free interval after curative HCC treat￾ment (23). The analysis was performed by setting the land￾mark time to 1 year and 2 years. To determine the factors
contributing to HCC recurrence, a time-dependent, extended
Cox proportional hazards model was developed. The time
period between primary HCC treatment and HCC recurrence
was set as the objective variable, while the age, sex, primary
HCC diameter, underlying liver disease (CH and/or LC),
treatment for primary HCC (surgery, RFA, or SRT), admini￾stration of IFN-free or IFN-based anti-HCV therapy after
primary HCC treatment, and the presence of early enhance￾ment of primary HCC were set as explanatory variables. The
administration of IFN-free DAA therapy was set as the time￾dependent explanatory variable (20, 21, 24). The time￾dependent expanded Cox proportional hazards model was
analyzed as follows:
h(t, X(t))= h0(t)exp [β1*Age (years)+β2*Gender (Man/
Woman)+β3*HCC diameter (cm)+β4*Underlying liver dis￾ease (CH/LC)+β5*therapy (Operation/ RFA/ SRT)+β6*IFN￾free DAA therapy (t)+β7*IFN-based therapy+β8*early
phase enhancement of primary HCC]
The software programs SAS for Windows Release ver. 9.4
(SAS Institute, Cary, USA) and R version 3.3.1 (R Founda￾tion for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) were used
for the analyses. A two-tailed p<0.05 indicated a significant
difference.
Results
Characteristics of the study population
A total of 76 patients met the inclusion criteria and were
included in the final analysis (Fig. 1). The baseline charac￾teristics of the patients are presented in Table 1. IFN-free
DAA therapy was administered to 17 patients (22.4%) dur￾ing the follow-up period [IFN-free DAA (+) group] but not
to the remaining 59 patients (77.6%) [IFN-free DAA (-)
group]. Within the IFN-free DAA (+) group, 8 patients re￾ceived daclatasvir and asunaprevir combination therapy for
24 weeks and 9 received sofosbuvir and ledipasvir combina￾tion therapy for 12 weeks. The median duration from cura￾tive treatment for primary HCC to induction of IFN-free
DAA therapy was 0.72 (0.31-10.4) years. All patients com￾pleted their course of treatment and achieved a sustained vi￾rologic response (SVR). No significant differences in the
sex, age at the diagnosis with primary HCC, underlying
liver disease, or Fib4 index were found between the two
groups. The diameter of the primary HCC in the IFN-free
DAA (+) group was significantly less than that in the IFN￾free DAA (-) group. Furthermore, no significant difference
in the treatment for primary HCC was found between the
groups. IFN therapy was administered to 8 of 59 patients
(13.6%) in the IFN-free DAA (-) group and 1 of 17 (5.9%)
in the IFN-free DAA (+) group during the follow-up period.
Two patients in the IFN-free DAA (-) group achieved SVR
by IFN therapy.
Influence of IFN-free DAA therapy on recurrence af￾ter curative treatment for primary HCC
HCC recurrence was observed in 45 of 59 (76.3%) pa￾tients in the IFN-free DAA (-) group and in 8 of 17 (47.1%)
in the IFN-free DAA (+) group. The median periods from
curative treatment for primary HCC to recurrence in the
IFN-free DAA (-) and IFN-free DAA (+) groups were 1.72
and 3.10 years, respectively.
Fig. 2 shows the landmark time analysis of the recurrence
rates in the two groups. The landmark time of Fig. 2A was
set at one year. Sixty-one patients had no HCC relapse for
one year after the curative treatment. Among them, eight pa￾tients were treated with IFN-free DAA therapy during that
time. Similarly, the landmark time of Fig. 2B was set at two
years. Thirty-nine patients had no HCC relapse for two
years after the curative treatment. Among them, seven pa￾tients were treated with IFN-free DAA therapy during that
time. Furthermore, no significant difference was found be￾tween the IFN-free DAA (-) and IFN-free DAA (+) groups
in the landmark time analysis set at 1 year and 2 years.
Influence of IFN-based therapy on recurrence after
curative treatment for primary HCC

for primary HCC (25-27). In this study, nine patients re￾ceived IFN-based therapy after curative treatment for pri￾mary HCC, and only two patients achieved SVR. Among
them, one patient with chronic hepatitis did not develop
HCC recurrence after IFN-based therapy. The other patient
with liver cirrhosis developed HCC at 6.5 years after cura￾tive treatment (4.5 years after the IFN treatment); however, a
second instance of recurrence was not observed in the sub￾sequent 2.4 years. In contrast, HCC continued to recur dur￾ing the follow-up period in patients who did not achieve
SVR by IFN-based therapy, except for in one patient who
subsequently received IFN-free DAA therapy. No recurrence
has been observed in patients who received both IFN-based
and IFN-free DAA therapies. On comparing the recurrence
rates after curative treatment for primary HCC by the land￾mark time analysis set at 1 year, no significant difference in
the recurrence rate was found between patients treated with
IFN-based therapy and those without IFN-based therapy (p=
0.319, data not shown).
The analysis of risk factors for HCC recurrence after
curative treatment
We analyzed the factors contributing to HCC recurrence
using a time-dependent expanded Cox proportional hazards
model that considers the time to induction of IFN-free DAA
therapy. Multivariate analysis results are shown in Table 2.
No significant factors, including a history of IFN-free DAA
therapy, were found among the study participants.
In addition, we analyzed the influence of IFN-free DAA
therapy on HCC recurrence according to the subgroup
analysis using a time-dependent extended Cox proportional
hazards model. As shown in Fig. 3, IFN-free DAA therapy
was not significantly associated with HCC recurrence after
curative treatment in any of the subgroups. However, IFN￾free DAA therapy in the presence of CH exhibited a trend
towards decreased HCC recurrence rates (hazard ratio=
0.142, p=0.372).
Influence of IFN-free DAA therapy on second HCC
recurrence after curative treatment for primary HCC
Some previous studies reported that anti-HCV therapy fol￾lowing HCC treatment prevented a second HCC recurrence
but not a first recurrence (25, 27-31). We therefore analyzed
the period until the second recurrence after treatment for
first HCC recurrence in our study population.
The period until the second recurrence after treatment for
first HCC recurrence was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier
method in patients followed for more than six months after
the treatment for the first recurrence. As shown in Fig. 4A,
no significant difference was found between the IFN-free
DAA (-) and (+) groups (p=0.068). Similarly, no significant
difference was noted in those who had received curative
treatment for the first HCC recurrence (p=0.115) (Fig. 4B).
However, IFN-free DAA therapy tended to reduce the fre￾quency of a second HCC recurrence.
Discussion
In the present study, we analyzed the effect of IFN-free
DAA therapy on HCC recurrence in patients with primary,
solitary tumors that had been treated curatively. Although
several studies have investigated this issue, to our knowl￾edge, none have limited their analysis to patients with pri￾mary, solitary HCC. Our results showed that IFN-free DAA

therapy did not have a significant effect on early-stage HCC
recurrence. However, IFN-free DAA therapy tended to re￾duce the HCC recurrence rate after curative treatment for
primary HCC in patients with CH and a second instance of
HCC recurrence after treatment for the first HCC recurrence.
The precise effects of IFN-free DAA therapy on HCC re￾currence after curative treatment remain unclear. Some retro￾spective studies have shown that the progression of hepatic
fibrosis, tumor-specific factors at the time of curative treat￾ment (such as numbers and size), and number of previous
treatments sessions are associated with the HCC recurrence
rate after IFN-free DAA therapy (17, 18, 32). In this study,
we limited the analysis to patients with primary, solitary
HCC cases that had been treated curatively to minimize the
influence of tumor-specific factors. Therefore, although the
sample size was limited, the analysis focused more on the
effect of IFN-free DAA therapy itself on HCC recurrence
than other studies.
In addition, in a systematic review and meta-analysis of
24 studies (1,820 subjects) conducted by Saraiya (33), the
risk of HCC recurrence after IFN-free DAA therapy was
higher in patients with a short interval between curative
treatment for HCC and IFN-free DAA therapy initiation
than those with a long interval. Therefore, assessing the tim￾ing of IFN-free DAA therapy after HCC curative treatment
is extremely important when retrospectively analyzing the
effect of IFN-free DAA therapy on HCC recurrence (19). To
take this factor into account, we used a landmark time
analysis and time-dependent extended Cox proportional haz￾ards model with this between-treatment interval as the time￾dependent variable and showed that IFN-free DAA therapy
did not have a significant influence on early-stage HCC re￾currence. If conventional Kaplan-Meier and Cox propor￾tional hazards model analyses had been used, we would
have concluded that IFN-free DAA decreased the HCC re￾currence (data not shown). This discrepancy may be ex￾plained by bias during selection for the induction of IFN￾free DAA therapy. In other words, IFN-free DAA therapy is
more easily given to patients who have survived and re￾mained recurrence-free for a long time and are at a low risk
of recurrence. Attention must be given to conventional
Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards model analyses
when retrospectively analyzing the effect of IFN-free DAA
therapy on HCC recurrence.
In the stratified analysis, the presence of CH exhibited a

was analyzed by a Kaplan-Meier analysis (A) in all patients
with a first HCC recurrence (n=25) and (B) in the patients who 
had received curative treatment for the first HCC recurrence 
(n=17). The patients who received IFN-free DAA therapy [IFN￾free DAA (+) group] are represented as a bold line, and those 
who had not received [IFN-free DAA (-) group] are presented

trend toward decreased HCC recurrence rates. This may be
due to a halt in genetic mutations after IFN-free DAA ther￾apy in the context of CH, in contrast to LC, where such mu￾tations would have already accumulated. In addition, despite
the small sample size, the second recurrence rate after treat￾ment for the first HCC recurrence tended to be lower in pa￾tients who had been treated with IFN-free DAA therapy af￾ter curative treatment for primary HCC than those without
IFN-free DAA therapy (Fig. 4). This is similar to the reports
that IFN treatment after curative HCC treatment did not af￾fect the first HCC recurrence rate but did have a suppressive
effect on the second HCC recurrence rate (25, 27, 28, 30).
However, some limitations associated with this study
should be noted. First, IFN-free DAA therapy was initiated
based on the attending physicians’ discretion. In addition,
selection bias cannot be denied for cases receiving IFN-free
DAA therapy considered to have a reduced risk of HCC re￾currence. Second, as we limited the analysis to patients with
primary, solitary tumors, the sample size was relatively
small. A prospective study based on large, evenly matched
patient groups (in terms of tumor size) is required to defini￾tively determine the effect of IFN-free DAA therapy on
HCC recurrence. However, conducting such a study prospec￾tively may face ethical issues due to the efficacy of IFN-free
DAA therapy in inhibiting liver function deterioration, lead￾ing to an improved HCC prognosis.
Conclusion
IFN-free DAA therapy did not contribute to early-stage
HCC recurrence after curative treatment according to a time￾dependent extended Cox proportional hazards model analy￾sis. However, a potential promotive effect cannot be defini￾tively excluded, and future studies with larger numbers of
patients are required. The time interval between curative
treatment for HCC and IFN-free DAA therapy must be
taken into account in retrospective analyses, which can be
achieved using a landmark time analysis and time-dependent
