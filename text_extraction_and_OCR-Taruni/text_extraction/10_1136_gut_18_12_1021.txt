Pathophysiology of hypotension in patients with
fulminant hepatic failure
P. N. TREWBY AND ROGER WILLIAMS
From the Liver Unit, King's College Hospital and Medical School, London
SUMMARY Studies on the incidence and pathophysiology of hypotension in fulminant hepatic
failure showed that 82 out of 94 patients developed arterial hypotension with a systolic blood
pressure of less than 80 mmHg. Such episodes accounted for 16 % of the total time spent in grade IV
coma. Factors such as haemorrhage, cardiac or respiratory abnormalities, extracorporeal perfusion,
or hypotension which occurred during the terminal stages of the illness, could be implicated for
only 400% of this time, leaving 600% as unexplained. Further investigation of these unexplained
factors showed that peripheral vasodilatation rather than primary heart failure was responsible,
and in all but three patients construction of ventricular function curves showed a normal ventricular
response to volume expansion with a corresponding increase in blood pressure. A small, but sig￾nificant, slowing of the heart rate occurred during these periods of unexplained hypotension. This,
together with the association that was found between the occurrence of hypotension and cerebral
oedema with coning, suggests that central vasomotor depression may be important in its pathogenesis.
Although the occurrence of hypotension in fulminant
hepatic failure is well recognised (Ritt et al., 1969;
Rueff and Benhamou, 1973), there is little published
information concerning its pathogenesis or even its
frequency. Its importance lies in the secondary
hypoxic brain damage that may ensue from the
associated reduction in cerebral blood flow and
cerebral oxygen delivery. The present analysis is
based on a series of 94 patients in whom we have
documented the total duration of the hypotension,
its significance in relation to the patient's clinical
course, and the apparent factors underlving it.
Particular attention has been paid to those patients
in whom hypotension could not be explained on the
basis of blood loss, respiratory difficulties, or
cardiac arrhythmias. The cardiac output and
indirect left atrial pressure have been measured in
these patients and ventricular function curves
constructed to determine the relative roles of heart
failure and peripheral vasodilatation. The possibility
of a central origin for the hypotension, perhaps
related to the cerebral oedema which appears so
frequently in this condition, was also investigated
(Gazzard et al., 1975).
Methods
The 94 patients were admitted to the Liver Failure
Received for publication 30 May 1977
Unit between 1974 and 1976, and all of them had
deteriorated to grade IV coma (Trey and Davidson,
1970) by the time of investigation. Aetiology of
fulminant hepatic failure included HBsAg negative
hepatitis (28 patients), HBsAg positive hepatitis (11),
paracetamol overdose (42), and 13 patients with
miscellaneous causes, including anaesthetic and
drug reactions, fatty liver of pregnancy, and Amanita
phalloides toxicity. The patients were treated with
standard supportive therapy which included 10%
dextrose infusions, oral lactulose, magnesium
sulphate enemata, and vitamin supplements. In
addition, 52 of them received temporary liver
support, 42 by perfusions of whole blood through
activated charcoal for a period of four hours daily
(Gazzard et al., 1974), and 10 by haemodialysis
using a polyacrylonitrile membrane and a Rhone￾Poulenc dialyser (RP6) (Silk et al., 1977) for a
period of four to eight hours daily.
Plasma electrolyte and arterial blood gas con￾centrations and liver and renal function were
measured at least once a day, and blood, urine, and,
where possible, sputum were cultured daily. A central
venous pressure line was inserted on admission and
its position was checked radiographically. The pulse,
blood pressure, respiratory rate, and central venous
pressure (cm water from the sternal angle), as well
as the clinical condition of the patient were then
recorded every hour.
Hypotension was defined as a systolic blood

pressure of less than 80 mmHg lasting longer than
one hour. Patients were grouped according to
whether hypotension had occurred afterhaemorhage,
a respiratory arrest or episode of hypoxaemia, a
cardiac arrest or cardiac arrhythmia, or in associa￾tion with extracorporeal perfusion, or whether it had
started only in the last 12 hours of life. Hypotension
in the remaining cases was classed as 'unexplained'.
CIRCULATORY ASSESSMENT
The cardiac output was measured in the first four
patients using dye dilution with indocyanine green
(Hamilton, 1962), and in the subsequent 12 patients
using thermodilution with a Swan-Ganz thermo￾dilution catheter (Ganz and Swan, 1962). The mean
of three readings for the cardiac output was taken,
and the cardiac index calculated from the equation:
Cardiac index (1 min-' m-2) =
cardiac output (I min-1)
body surface area (m2)
The indexed systemic peripheral resistance was
derived from the equation:
Indexed systemic peripheral resistance (dyne. s cm-5
m-2) =
Mean blood pressure (mmHg) x 80
Cardiac index (1 min-'m-2)
(Wood, 1956), where mean blood pressure =
diastolic blood pressure + 1/3 pulse difference.
The indirect left atrial pressure was measured using
a flow-directed, balloon-tipped catheter (Ganz and
Swan, 1962), and the effect of rapid infusion of
500 ml of fresh frozen plasma on the indirect left
atrial pressure and cardiac output was determined
in selected patients. The left ventricular stroke work
index was calculated in these patients before and
after fluid infusion from the formula:
Left ventricular stroke work index =
Cardiac index x mean blood pressure x 13-5 gmm-2
Heart rate x 1000
(Carey et al., 1967). The two values for left ventri￾cular stroke work index for each patient were
plotted against the indirect left atrial pressure to
obtain the ventricular function curve. The effects
of five minute infusions of isoprenaline (10 mg/min)
and dopamine (120 mcg/min) on left ventricular
function were also studied in one patient.
Results
Hypotension was recorded on at least one occasion
in 82 of the 94 patients while they were in grade IV
coma. Each patient had two episodes of hypotension
on average (range one to four), and spent a mean
of 18-8 hours with a systolic blood pressure of less
than 80 mmHg. This represented 16-3 % of the total
time in grade IV coma (Table 1). When the time
spent hypotensive was analysed according to the
most likely cause, only 25 % could be accounted for
on the basis of either haemorrhage, hypoxia,
respiratory arrest, cardiac arrhythmia, or cardiac
arrest. Four per cent could be explained on the
basis of extracorporeal haemoperfusion and of the
19 patients with this complication it was the only
cause of the hypotension in five, and in the remaining
14 it represented the first episode of hypotension.
A further 11 % of the time spent hypotensive could
be accounted for by those episodes of hypotension
which developed during the last 12 hours of life.
The remaining 60% of the total time could therefore
not be explained on the basis of the above factors.
Individual consideration of the patients showed that
in 56 of the 94 there were one or more episodes of
unexplained hypotension, their average total dura￾tion being 17 hours, which represented 15% of the
total time that each of the 56 patients spent in
grade IV coma. Only four of these 56 patients
survived to leave hospital, while 11 of the 38 not
developing episodes of unexplained hypotension
made a complete recovery (X2 = 6-48, p < 0 02).
Hypotension due to known causes was also assoc￾iated with a bad prognosis, with only two of these
20 patients surviving, compared with nine of 18
who remained normotensive throughout their illness,
or in whom hypotension developed only terminally
(X2 = 5-55, p < 005).
There was no evidence to implicate fluid depletion
in the pathogenesis of the unexplained episodes of
hypotension, as, during the 24 hours before its
development, the mean positive fluid balance for
these patients was 1288 ml, and only three of the
patients had been maintained in a negative fluid
balance because of previous fluid overload or a high
central venous pressure. Infection could not be
implicated either, for in only three patients was there
bacteriological evidence of infection at the time of
the fall in blood pressure.
The maximum prolongation of the prothrombin
time, which was taken as an indication of the
severity of liver damage, was found to be signifi￾cantly longer in those patients with unexplained
hypotension than in those who either remained
normotensive throughout their illness or in whom
the development of hypotension had been precipi￾tated by known factors, the mean values being
98 ± 6 seconds and 68 ± 5 seconds respectively
(mean ± 1 SEM, P<0-001). There was no difference
in the severity of renal failure in those with un￾explained hypotension as compared with those
without, the mean values for serum creatinine being

HAEMODYNAMIC CHANGES DURING UNEX￾PLAINED HYPOTENSION
There was no consistent evidence of heart failure in
the 56 patients with unexplained hypotension. Thus,
serial measurements of central venous pressure gave
a mean value of 2-1 cm H20 immediately before the
onset of hypotension and 0-82 cm H20 afterwards.
The mean cardiac index measured in 16 patients
during an episode of unexplained hypotension was
3-32 ± 1 SEM 0-30 1 min-1 m-2, which was within
the accepted normal range (Doyle et al., 1953)
(3-2 ± 2 SD 0 4), and this was reduced in only three
of the hypotensive patients (Table 2). In two of the
five patients in whom it was measured both before
and during the period of hypotension, the cardiac
output actually increased (Fig. 1), whereas in all
five patients the derived peripheral resistance fell.
An unexpected observation was that with the
development of hypotension the heart rate fell

In the 11 patients in whom it was measured during
an unexplained episode of hypotension, the indirect
left atrial pressure was found to be normal with a
mean value of 2-2 mmHg (range 0-7T5 mmHg).
Assessment of left ventricular response to fluid infus￾ion showed that in eight of these lIthe left ventricular
stroke work index increased markedly after infusion
of 500 ml plasma (Fig. 2), and the systolic blood
pressure rose from a mean of 63 mmHgto 102mmHg.
Although seven of these eight patientseventuallydied,
and four of them had between one and four further
hypotensive episodes before death, in all but two of
them the blood pressure responded again to volume
expansion, and the conscious level in two patients
showed a definite improvementafterthe restoration of
a normal blood pressure. In three of the 11 patients
there was evidence of heart failure with flat ventri￾cular function curves (Fig. 2). The indirect left atrial
pressure in these patients was higher than in the
remainder before volume expansion, although values
for venous pressure were similar. Two of the three
had been hypotensive for more than 18 hours before
investigation and had ischaemic changes on the
electrocardiogram with ST depression and T-wave
inversion. The third patient, who had been hypo￾tensive for only two hours, had a normal electro￾cardiogram and, after a five minute infusion of
isoprenaline (10 mg/min), a moderate increase in
left ventricular stroke work index and blood pressure
occurred (Table 3), but the heart rate rose to 160/min.
When dopamine (0-12 mg/min) was infused for five
minutes there was a greater increase in left ventri￾cular stroke work index with a heart rate of only
110/min (Table 3). Furthermore, urine output,
which had been zero for the previous four hours,
increased to 50 ml/h. With continuous infusion of
dopamine the patient's cardiovascular status re￾1023

Pathophysiology ofhypotension in patients with fulminant hepatic failure
With respect to cerebral oedema and coning, 11
out of the 22 patients who had had episodes of
unexplained hypotension during life and in whom
the brain was examined at necropsy, had evidence
of brainstem coning with temporal lobe or cerebellar
herniation. By contrast, cerebral oedema of this
degree was present in none of the 16 patients who
had not developed unexplained hypotension during
life and in whom the brain was examined at necropsy
(X2 = 6-30, p < 0 02).
Discussion
The increased mortality in the patients who became
hypotensive during the course of their illness is
perhaps not surprising. The associated reduction in
cerebral, as well as myocardial, renal, and hepatic
perfusion may have resulted in secondary ischaemic
damage in these organs, and in an animal model of
hepatic failure we have recently demonstrated that
when the systolic blood pressure falls to only
90 mmHg there is a significant reduction in both the
cerebral blood flow and the cerebral metabolic rate
for oxygen (Trewby et al., 1978). An alternative
explanation is that the hypotension may not in itself
have affected the mortality but merely reflected a
more severe underlying hepatic necrosis. The sig￾nificantly longer prothrombin time in the patients
with episodes of unexplained hypotension was in
keeping with this explanation and suggested a
greater impairment of liver function in these patients.
In the patients with unexplained hypotension the
combination of a low blood pressure and a normal
cardiac output suggests that inappropriate vaso￾dilatation, rather than primary myocardial pump
failure, was responsible. This was supported by the
normal or low pulmonary artery wedge pressure
and central venous pressure. Furthermore, the
ventricular function curve was normal in seven out
of 11 of the patients in whom it was measured, and
in two of the three patients in whom it was abnormal
myocardial damage may have occurred as a result
of the prolonged hypotension.
With respect to the possible causes of this vaso￾dilatation, the significantly slower heart rate in the
patients when hypotensive than when normotensive,
and the association between the unexplained hypo￾tension and cerebral oedema with coning, suggests
a central mechanism. However, not all the patients
who became hypotensive had evidence of coning,
and in 11 of 22 patients examined at necropsy the
brain was macroscopically normal. In these patients
it is possible that a metabolic insult to the vasomotor
centre, not in itself of sufficient severity to cause
macroscopic structural changes or cerebral oedema,
could nevertheless result in damage to the vasomotor
centre.
Alternatively, vasodilatation may be consequent
on the appearance of vasoactive compounds in the
circulation which may fail to be metabolised by the
necrotic liver, or are released from it. In favour of
this mechanism was the correlation found between
unexplained hypotension and the severity of the
hepatic necrosis as assessed by the prothrombin time.
One such vasoactive compound, endotoxin, has
been demonstrated in the serum of 64% of patients
with fulminant hepatic failure (Wilkinson et al.,
1974), and injection of endotoxin experimentally
leads to the opening up of peripheral arteriovenous
shunts (Liehr et al., 1975). In this respect it is of
interest that intrapulmonary shunts of up to 39%
of the cardiac output have been demonstrated in
patients with fulminant hepatic failure with a corres￾ponding increase in peripheral vasodilatation
(Trewby et al., 1976). Vasointestinal peptide,
bradykinin, and histamine could all act in a similar
way. Alternatively, weak sympathetic neurotrans￾mitters may accumulate in hepatic failure and result
in a diminished peripheral resistance by competitive
inhibition of noradrenaline. Octopamine is one such
putative false neurotransmitter, but in a recent
investigation we found the highest serum concen￾trations in the normotensive, and not in the hypo￾tensive, patients (Trewby et al., 1977). This could
be explained if octopamine were released from sym￾pathetic nerve terminals along with noradrenaline
and if sympathetic drive were increased in the
normotensive patients but it does not suggest a
causative role for octopamine in the genesis of the
hypotension.
With regard to treatment, there was a satisfactory
increase in left ventricular stroke work index and
blood pressure in response to volume expansion in
eight out of 11 patients studied. The danger of
volume expansion is that it may predispose to
pulmonary oedema, especially in the presence of
coexistent renal failure. Although pulmonary oedema
was seen on the chest radiographs of three patients,
in one this had developed before the onset of
hypotension, and in the other two the pulmonary
artery wedge pressure was within normal limits when
pulmonary oedema was first noticed, suggesting that
fluid overload was not the cause of the oedema. In
the few patients with evidence of myocardial failure,
dopamine proved superior to isoprenaline as an
inotropic agent. Experimentally, dopamine not only
improves myocardial function but also results in
dilatation of both splanchnic and renal vascular
beds (Goldberg, 1972), and in one patient urine
output increased to normal after infusion of
dopamine. In two patients there was a convincing
improvement in mental state when normal blood
pressure had been restored. However, it might be

more beneficial if episodes of hypotension, with all
their potentially damaging consequences, could be
prevented, but we are hindered by the inevitable
primary role of cerebral oedema, which represents
a major problem, both with respect to pathogenesis
and its control by therapy, in the syndrome of
fulminant hepatic failure.
