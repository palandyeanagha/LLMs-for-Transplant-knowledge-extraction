Activation of the innate immune system plays a key role in exacerbations of chronic lung disease, yet the potential
role of lung fibroblasts in innate immunity and the identity of epithelial danger signals (alarmins) that may contribute to
this process are unclear. The objective of the study was to identify lung epithelial-derived alarmins released during
endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress) and oxidative stress and evaluate their potential to induce innate immune
responses in lung fibroblasts. We found that treatment of primary human lung fibroblasts (PHLFs) with conditioned
media from damaged lung epithelial cells significantly upregulated interleukin IL-6, IL-8, monocyte chemotactic
protein-1, and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor expression (Po0.05). This effect was reduced
with anti-IL-1a or IL-1Ra but not anti-IL-1b antibody. Costimulation with a Toll-like receptor 3 ligand, polyinosinic–
polycytidylic acid (poly I:C), significantly accentuated the IL-1a-induced inflammatory phenotype in PHLFs, and this
effect was blocked with inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase subunit beta and TGFb-activated kinase-1 inhibitors.
Finally, Il1r1  /  and Il1a  /  mice exhibit reduced bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) neutrophilia and collagen
deposition in response to bleomycin treatment. We conclude that IL-1a plays a pivotal role in triggering proinflammatory
responses in fibroblasts and this process is accentuated in the presence of double-stranded RNA. This mechanism may
be important in the repeated cycles of injury and exacerbation in chronic lung disease.
INTRODUCTION
Clearance of invading pathogens and effective tissue repair is
managed in the respiratory tract by tightly controlled immune
responses involving the regulated recruitment, activation, and
subsequent resolution of inflammatory cells.1 In chronic lung
disease where there is dysregulation of repair processes
resulting in failure to fully resolve inflammation, further
bystander tissue damage can result from the cytotoxic proper￾ties of soluble proteases and reactive oxygen species released
from activated neutrophils and macrophages.2–5 This chronic
response can lead to the development of fibrosis, characterized
by intensive fibroproliferation and activation of airway or
parenchymal fibroblasts.
Fibroblasts constitute up to 30% of cells in the normal lung
interstitum, and in the diseased lung can account for 50% of
cells.6 The role of activated fibroblasts as the major fibrogenic
cell of the lung is well characterized, but less is known about the
potential for these cells to contribute to innate immune and
inflammatory responses.
A common pathological feature of chronic inflammatory
lung diseases is epithelial damage that may lead to release of
alarmins (damage-associated molecular patterns) that trigger
further inflammation and mediate recruitment of immuno￾cytes to the site of injury. Epithelial damage may result from a
variety of causes including microbial attack, proteolytic
damage, the effects of bystander reactive oxygen species,7,8
and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress.9,10 Two factors that
may contribute to ER stress in chronic inflammatory and
fibrotic lung diseases are oxidative stress induced by cigarette
smoke11 and viral infections that trigger ER stress and unfolded

protein response in an inositol-requiring enzyme 1-dependant
manner.12 On the cellular level, ER stress is caused by
accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins that may
be a consequence of a mutation or intensified translation of
proteins that cannot be folded in an efficient manner.13 In
addition, recent studies revealed that oxidative stress may also
trigger the unfolded protein response by upregulating glucose￾regulated protein 78 (GRP78) and protein ubiquitination.14 ER
stress activates unfolded protein response that may trigger
prosurvival mechanisms such as ER stress-associated protein
degradation or may promote apoptotic mechanisms, including
caspase-1 activation.14 Although the activation of unfolded
protein response has been demonstrated in several chronic
inflammatory diseases including chronic obstructive pulmon￾ary disease (COPD),9 it is unclear as to how ER stress may
contribute to inflammatory responses.
Here we show that conditioned media from primary human
bronchial epithelial cells (PBECs) damaged with ER stress or
oxidative stress are able to trigger a proinflammatory
phenotype in primary human lung fibroblasts (PHLFs). We
demonstrate that interleukin (IL)-1a (and not IL-1b) is the
critical innate immune trigger released by stressed lung
epithelial cells, and we show that PHLFs are characterized
by responsiveness to selected pathogens and damage-associated
molecular patterns that is distinct from that of macrophages.
We reveal the potential for synergistic proinflammatory actions
of Toll-like receptor 3 agonists and IL-1a on fibroblasts that are
likely to be highly relevant in viral-driven exacerbations of
chronic lung disease. Finally, we demonstrate that Il1a  / 
and Il1r1  /  mice exhibit reduced bronchoalveolar lavage
(BAL) neutrophilia and collagen deposition in response to
bleomycin treatment.
RESULTS
Conditioned media from epithelial cells damaged with ER
stress and oxidative stress trigger a proinflammatory
phenotype in lung fibroblasts
To determine the potential for damaged epithelial cells to
influence fibroblast behavior, human bronchial epithelial cells
(16HBE14o  ) were damaged by pulsing for 2 h with
thapsigargin (TG) to induce ER stress or H2O2 to induce
oxidative stress. After 2 h, the culture medium was replaced,
and following 24 h of incubation it was collected and used
to treat human lung fibroblasts (MRC5) for 5 h. Both TG
(Figure 1c) and H2O2 (Supplementary Figure S1A online)
treatment significantly reduced epithelial cell viability. The
induction of ER stress following TG treatment was confirmed
by XBP-1 (X-box binding protein 1) splicing (Figure 1a) and an
increase in GRP78 gene expression (Figure 1b). Control media
from 16HBE14o  had a modest influence on the expression of
transcripts for IL-6 and IL-8 in MRC5 cells. In contrast, media
from TG (Figure 1d,e) or H2O2 (Supplementary Figure
S1B,C)-damaged 16HBE14o  strongly induced transcripts
for each cytokine. To explore signaling pathways through
which these effects may be mediated, we determined pattern
recognition receptor (PRR) gene expression in MRC5 cells and
PHLFs. Quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction
revealed high expression of IL-1R in PHLFs that was con￾firmed at protein level by western blot and immuno￾fluorescence (Supplementary Figures S2A–C), whereas
Toll-like receptors were expressed at considerably lower or
undetectable levels. An analogous pattern of PRR expression
was found with MRC5 cells (Supplementary Figure S2D),
confirming that this cell line can be employed as a model for
PHLF innate immune signaling. However, a different pattern
of PRR expression was found for THP1 macrophages
(Supplementary Figure S2E), indicating that PHLFs and
MRC5 cells have a PRR distinct expression profile compared
with classical immunoregulatory cells.
ER stress- and oxidative stress-induced epithelial damage
leads to release of damage-associated molecular patterns
From the data above we hypothesized that IL-1R signaling
could be required for the stimulation of an inflammatory
phenotype in fibroblasts induced by damaged epithelia. IL-1a
and IL-1b are two major cytokines able to activate IL-1R, and
both of them may be released by stressed cells. Therefore, to
establish whether ER stress and oxidative stress may trigger
release of these cytokines, PBECs were exposed to varying doses
of TG (Figure 2) or H2O2 (Supplementary Figure S3).
Induction of ER stress in PBECs was confirmed by XBP-1
splicing (Figure 2a) and an increase in GRP78 gene expression
(Figure 2b). TG induced a dose-dependent decrease in PBEC
cell viability (Figure 2c) and led to release of IL-1a (Figure 2d)
and high-mobility group protein B1 (HMGB1), a classical
marker of cellular damage (Figure 2e). IL-1b release was also
detected in conditioned media from TG-damaged PBECs, but
its concentration was significantly lower compared with IL-1a
levels (Figure 2d). HMGB1 release was strictly associated with
cell death, whereas elevated levels of IL-1a could be detected
even after treatment with TG doses (7.5–10 mM) that did not
cause detectable decrease in PBEC cell viability. An analogous
pattern of PBEC cell death and alarmin release was observed in
response to H2O2-induced oxidative stress (Supplementary
Figure S3). Pretreatment of PBECs with N-acetyl-L-cysteine, a
potent antioxidant, inhibited H2O2-induced IL-1a release and
cell death (Supplementary Figure S4). Furthermore, IL-1a
was localized by immunohistochemistry to the human bron￾chial and alveolar epithelium in tissue sections, confirming its
presence in the epithelium of the human lung (Supplementary
Figure S5).
IL-1a is the predominant epithelial damage-associated
molecular pattern triggering a proinflammatory phenotype
in lung fibroblasts
From the data above we hypothesized that IL-1a/IL-1R
signaling could be required for stimulation of an inflammatory
phenotype in fibroblasts by damaged epithelia. To test this
hypothesis, PHLFs were treated with conditioned media from
ER stress-damaged PBECs that had been preincubated with
neutralizing antibody (NAb) for IL-1a or IL-1b. To establish a

requirement for IL-1R, similar experiments were carried out in
PHLFs pretreated with IL-1R antagonist (IL-1Ra). IL-1a NAb
and IL-1Ra significantly reduced induction of IL-6, IL-8,
monocyte chemotactic protein-1, and granulocyte macrophage
colony-stimulating factor gene expression in PHLFs treated
with conditioned media from PBECs damaged with TG
(Figure 3). In contrast, IL-1b NAb had mild influence or
was without significant effects. In all cases, the treatment with
IL-1a NAb resulted in reduction of the measured cytokine
expression close to control level (untreated fibroblasts),
suggesting IL-1a is the predominant epithelial cell-derived
factor responsible for inducing an inflammatory phenotype in
fibroblasts. In addition, IL-1a NAb and IL-1Ra blocked IL-6,
IL-8, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, and granulocyte macro￾phage colony-stimulating factor gene expression in fibroblasts
treated with conditioned media from oxidative stress-damaged
PBECs (Supplementary Figure S6). The efficacy of IL-1a NAb,
IL-1b NAb, and IL-1Ra was verified with a functional assay
using IL-6 gene expression as a surrogate of IL-1R activation
(Supplementary Figure S7).
PHLFs show unique responsiveness to danger signals
To confirm the observations described above, PHLFs were
treated for 24 h with increasing doses of IL-1a, after which
conditioned media from the cells were collected and subjected
to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for IL-8. The
analysis revealed that IL-1a treatment significantly increased
the amount of released IL-8 protein from PHLFs (Figure 4a).
Interestingly, neither IL-1a nor IL-1b treatment resulted in
increased secretion of IL-8 from primary human alveolar
macrophages (Figure 4b).
Bacterial and viral infections have been recognized as
important risk factors in exacerbations of chronic fibrotic
lung diseases. Therefore, we investigated the responsiveness of
PHLFs to bacterial lipopolysaccharide and polyinosinic–
polycytidylic acid (poly I:C)—an analog of viral RNA. PHLFs
moderately responded to poly I:C, as demonstrated by a
significant upregulation of IL-6 gene expression, but showed
only a weak responsiveness to bacterial lipopolysaccharide and
no response to another Toll-like receptor 4 ligand, HMGB1
(Figure 4c–f).

Figure 3 Interleukin-1a (IL-1a) is the key alarmin released from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-damaged epithelial cells that activates
expression of proinflammatory cytokines in primary human lung fibroblasts (PHLFs). PHLF’s were treated for 5 h with conditioned media from
untreated primary human bronchial epithelial cells (UT PBECs) or PBECs pulsed for 2 h with 7.5 or 20 mM thapsigargin (PBEC TG) and collected after a
further 24 h. Before adding to the PHLFs, the conditioned media were preincubated for 1 h at 37 1C in the presence or absence of IL-1a (4 mg ml  1
) or IL-1b
(4 mg ml  1
) neutralizing antibody (NAb). To inhibit IL-1R signaling, PHLFs were pretreated for 1 h with IL-1Ra (500 ng ml  1
) after which the culture
media were replaced with conditioned media from damaged epithelial cells containing the same concentration of IL-1Ra. Following 5 h of treatment,
samples were collected for RNA. IL-1a NAb and IL-1Ra significantly reduced gene expression of (a) IL-6, (b) IL-8, (c) monocyte chemotactic
protein-1 (MCP-1), and (d) granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) induced following treatment with conditioned media

Poly I:C synergizes with IL-1a to stimulate fibroblast
cytokine expression via TGFb-activated kinase-1/inhibitor
of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase subunit beta signaling
As primary human lung fibroblasts strongly respond to
IL-1a and poly I:C, we investigated the potential for an
additive or synergistic effect of these two factors. PHLFs were
treated with poly I:C or IL-1a alone or in combination for 24 h
before quantification of IL-6 and IL-8 expression. The
immunocytofluorescent analysis showed that combined IL￾1a and poly I:C treatment markedly stimulated accumulation
of IL-6 within intracellular granules of fibroblasts (Figure 5a),
as well as increased IL-6 and IL-8 gene expression (Figure 5b–
e) and protein secretion (Supplementary Figure S8). Inhibitors
of TAK1 and IKK2 kinases blocked the individual and
combined effects of IL-1a and poly I:C on both IL-6 and
IL-8 gene expression (Figure 5b–e) and protein release
(Supplementary Figure S8). From these data we conclude
that a TGFb-activated kinase-1/inhibitor of nuclear factor
kappa-B kinase subunit beta signaling pathway mediates IL-1a
and poly I:C stimulation of a proinflammatory phenotype in
lung fibroblasts.
Il1r1  /  and Il1a  /  mice exhibit reduced BAL
neutrophilia and collagen deposition in response to
bleomycin treatment
C57Bl/6 wild-type, Il1r1  /  , and Il1a  /  mice were
intratracheally instilled with bleomycin sulfate (0.15 U) and
killed on day 7 or day 21. Saline-treated C57Bl/6 mice were used
as a control. Bleomycin has previously been shown to induce
significant levels of oxidative stress in lung epithelial cells,15 and
treatment withN-acetyl cysteine, a potent antioxidant, has been
shown to reduce bleomycin-induced fibrosis.16 Bleomycin
treatment of C57Bl/6 mice increased the levels of peroxir￾edoxin-SO3, a marker of induction of oxidative stress, in lung
epithelial cells (Figure 6a) and induced a marked influx in both
the frequency (Figure 6b,c) and number (data not shown) of
Ly6G þ neutrophils into the BAL 7 days after treatment.
This influx is significantly reduced in both Il1r1  /  and
Il1a  /  mice. In addition, bleomycin treatment of C57Bl/6
mice induced dramatic tissue remodeling and collagen
deposition by day 21 (Figure 6d,e). Again, both tissue
remodeling and collagen deposition were significantly
reduced in both Il1r1  /  and Il1a  /  mice.

DISCUSSION
Repetitive damage to the airway or alveolar epithelium,
associated with inflammation and tissue remodeling, are
common features of many chronic respiratory diseases
including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis,17 COPD,7 asthma,14
and bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS).18 Chronic
inflammation, characterized by intensive protein production,
may also cause ER stress and an unfolded protein response that
may lead to programmed cell death.19 The lung epithelium is
the first point of contact for inhaled oxidants/free radicals and
these species are normally neutralized by antioxidants present
in epithelial lining fluid.7,20 Defining how oxidant and ER
stress-induced epithelial cell damage stimulates inflammation
and identifying the molecular mediators that cross-talk
between damaged and dying epithelial cells and the immune
system are important goals necessary to improve our knowl￾edge of the pathophysiological events that underlie chronic
pulmonary disease.
Epithelial injury is a well-recognized histological feature in
patients with chronic inflammatory lung diseases including
COPD and BOS, and both alloimmune and nonalloimmune
insults to the airway epithelium after lung transplan￾tation have been associated with an increased incidence of
BOS.21 Our work described here makes the case for a new
paradigm, specifically that bronchial epithelium damaged with
ER or oxidative stress can induce sterile innate immune
signaling in lung fibroblasts, resulting in a phenotypic
switch toward a highly proinflammatory state. We have shown
that the proinflammatory lung fibroblasts secrete vast quan￾tities of the neutrophil chemokine IL-8 and the pleiotropic
cytokine IL-6 that can induce T-cell22 and monocyte23
differentiation.
Previous reports indicate that fibroblasts from chronically
inflamed tissues, such as synovial fibroblasts from arthritic
joints, show alterations in inflammatory gene expression and
signaling cascades in comparison with fibroblasts from normal
tissue, and that this modified phenotype may be maintained
for many passages in vitro,
24 suggesting that fibroblasts may
play an important role in the switch from acute to chronic
inflammation. Here, we were able to show that a single alarmin,
IL-1a, is both necessary and sufficient for the epithelial
damage-induced phenotypic switch of lung fibroblasts to
their inflammatory state. We have also demonstrated that
Il1r1  /  and Il1a  /  mice exhibit reduced BAL neutro￾philia and collagen deposition in response to bleomycin
treatment. Our observations are in agreement with those in
a recent study by Tracy et al.,
25 showing that IL-1a is the major
epithelial alarmin released from lung epithelial cells to induce
inflammatory mediators in fibroblasts during photodynamic
therapy. The implication of IL-1a in chronic lung diseases is

Figure 5 Interleukin (IL)-1a and polyinosinic–polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) synergize in the induction of IL-6 and IL-8 expression in primary human lung
fibroblasts (PHLFs). Cotreatment of PHLFs for 24 h with IL-1a (500 pg ml  1
) and poly I:C (10 mg ml  1
) markedly enhanced accumulation of
(a) intracellular IL-6 protein and (b–e) gene expression of IL-8 and IL-6 in comparison with treatment with IL-1a or poly I:C alone. Pretreatment for 1 h with
(b, c) TAK1 (1 mM) or (d, e) IKK2 (1 mM) inhibitors significantly reduced IL-6 and IL-8 gene expression by PHLFs in response to treatment with IL-1a and
poly I:C individually or in combination. Relative gene expression was measured by qRT-PCR using glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH) as a housekeeping gene. Intracellular IL-6 protein was visualized by immunocytofluorescence. IKK2, inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase

additionally supported by the recent discovery of anti-IL-1a
autoantibodies in the blood of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
patients17 and increased levels of IL-1Ra in lung allograft
recipients who developed BOS,18 suggesting that extracellular
IL-1a is an undesirable and potentially harmful factor in
fibrotic lung diseases. In addition, IL-1a is upregulated in
the lungs of patients with COPD,26 and fibroblasts isolated
from the lungs of patients with COPD secrete increased levels
of proinflammatory factors compared with normal fibro￾blasts.27 Taken together, these observations build a case for
investigating the therapeutic potential of biologics that
attenuate IL-1a/IL-1R signaling in these chronic lung diseases
that are associated with significant morbidity and premature
mortality.
Our observation that poly I:C acts in synergy with IL-1a
raises the intriguing possibility that the degree to which
fibroblasts affect lung inflammation may be influenced
by respiratory viral infections. Conditions such as COPD
and asthma are exacerbated by community-acquired viral
respiratory tract infections, and such infections also trigger
immune-mediated epithelial injury in posttransplant patients
associated with the development of BOS.28 Furthermore,
respiratory viruses have been implicated with acute exacer￾bations in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis that are
associated with significant mortality in this group.29 Extra￾cellular double-stranded viral RNA molecules released from
dying or damaged viral-infected lung epithelial cells would, as
shown here with poly I:C, be able to enter lung fibroblasts and
synergize with IL-1a/IL-1R signaling to exert a powerful
proinflammatory effect.
In addition, our observations suggest that fibroblasts show a
unique and distinct PRR expression profile and responsiveness
to PRR ligands than alveolar macrophages, suggesting that
these two cell types may play different roles in the recognition of
danger signals and triggering innate immune responses during
infection and trauma.
Figure 6 Il1r1  /  and Il1a  /  mice exhibit reduced bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) neutrophilia and collagen deposition in response to
bleomycin treatment. C57Bl/6 (wild-type (WT) Bleo), Il1r1  /  (Il1r1  /  Bleo), and Il1a  /  (Il1a  /  Bleo) mice were intratracheally
instilled with bleomycin sulfate (0.15 U) or saline as a control and killed on day 7 or day 21. Bleomycin treatment of WT mice induced an increase in
the levels of the oxidative stress marker (a) peroxiredoxin-SO3 and a (b, c) marked influx of Ly6G þ neutrophils into the BAL on day 7 (d7) after
treatment. This influx is significantly reduced in Il1r1  /  and Il1a  /  mice. In addition, bleomycin treatment of WT mice induced dramatic
(d) tissue remodeling and (e) collagen deposition (as measured by hydroxyproline) by day 21. Both remodeling and collagen deposition were significantly
reduced in Il1r1  /  and Il1a  /  mice. Data represented by mean±s.e.m.; n ¼ 7–9 per group. *Po0.05, **Po0.01.

In summary, we have presented data revealing an IL-1a and
double-stranded RNA signaling network that operates to
trigger a powerful proinflammatory phenotype in lung
fibroblasts in response to ER stress- and reactive oxygen
species-induced epithelial cell damage.We suggest this network
may facilitate the establishment of a chronic inflammatory
disease state in the lung and that targeting its different
components individually or in combination may be of benefit
in the prevention of tissue destruction in patients with chronic
lung disease.
Study approval
All participants provided informed consent before participa￾tion in this study. All aspects of the study were approved by
Newcastle and North Tyneside Local Research Ethics Com￾mittee (Ref. 2001/179).
METHODS
Antibodies. Antibodies used for immunoblotting and immuno￾fluorescence were as follows: IL-1R1 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA), IL-6
(R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), IL-1a (Abcam), fibronectin
(Abcam), peroxiredoxin-SO3 (Abcam), and E-cadherin (BD
Bioscience, San Jose, CA). Neutralizing antibodies were as follows:
anti-human: IL-1b and IL-1a (R&D Systems).
Chemical inhibitors. TAK1i ((5Z)-7-Oxozeaenol) and IKK-2i IV
(5-(p-Fluorophenyl)-2-ureido]thiophene-3-carboxamide) were pur￾chased from Calbiochem (Nottingham, UK). Human recombinant
IL-1Ra was obtained from R&D Systems.
Primers. The quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction primers
have been listed in Supplementary Table S1 online.
Primary cell isolation and culture. Human PBECs were obtained by
bronchial brushings from stable posttransplant patients and were
cultured on 0.5% Purecol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA)-coated dishes in
SABM medium containing 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U ml  1
penicillin, and 100 mg ml  1 streptomycin (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland).
PHLFs were isolated using collagenase II digestion technique. Briefly,
lung tissue pieces were minced, washed on a 40 mm filter with
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium/F12 (Sigma, St Louis, MO), and
digested with 0.2% type II collagenase (Worthington Biochemical,
Lakewood, NJ) at room temperature for 2 h. After washing with
1  phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), the cells were filtered through
large gauze followed by 100 mm filter. The cells were collected
by centrifugation at 300 g and plated at a density of 80,000 cells cm 2
in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium/F12 (Sigma) supplemented
with 10% FBS, 1% L-glutamine, 100 U ml  1 penicillin, and
100 mg ml  1 streptomycin. The cells were then left to attach for 1 h,
after which they were washed with 1  PBS and fresh culture medium
was added.
Primary alveolar macrophages were obtained from BALs
of stable lung transplant recipients. The BALs were centri￾fugated at 1,500 g for 5 min, after which the pellets were washed
twice with PBS and suspended in RPMI medium containing 10%
FBS (Sigma).
Cell line culture. MRC5 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s medium/F12 (Sigma) containing 10% FBS, 1% L-glutamine,
100 U ml  1 penicillin, and 100 mg ml  1 streptomycin.
The 16HBE14o  cells were maintained in MEM/EBSS (Thermo
Scientific, Logan, UT) supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% L-glutamine,
100 U ml  1 penicillin, and 100 mg ml  1 streptomycin.
THP-1 cells were maintained in RPMI medium (Sigma) supple￾mented with 10% FBS, 1% L-glutamine, 100 U ml  1 penicillin, and
100 mg ml  1 streptomycin.
All cells were maintained at 37 1C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2.
Mice. C57Bl/6 (WT) mice were purchased from Taconic Farms
(Hudson, NY). Il1r1  /  mice on the B6 background were obtained
through a supply contract between the National Institute of Allergy
and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and Taconic Farms. Il1a  /  mice
were originally derived by Y. Iwakura (Tokyo University, Tokyo,
Japan) and are maintained on a B6 background under specific
pathogen-free conditions at the National Institutes of Health in an
American Association for the Accreditation of Laboratory Animal
Care–approved facility. The NIAID animal care and use committee
approved all experimental procedures and mice were used at 8–10
weeks of age for experiments.
Bleomycin. Single intratracheal instillation of saline (30 ml) or
bleomycin sulfate (0.15 U in 30 ml of saline) were administered to C57Bl/
6, Il1a /  , and Il1r1 /  mice. Half of the mice were killed by
pentobarbital overdose on day 7 and their tracheas cannulated with an
Insyte venous catheter (BD Bioscience). BAL was performed with ice￾cold PBS supplemented with 5 mM EDTA and the frequency of
neutrophils determined using flow cytometry. The remaining mice were
harvested at day 21. For histological analyses, matched lung lobes were
washed with PBS, inflated with Bouin’s fixative, and stained with
Masson’s trichrome. For assessment offibrosis, matched lung lobes were
weighed and digested with 2 ml of 6 N HCl to measure the quantity of
hydroxyproline as described in Wynn et al.30
Immunoblotting. Proteins were separated using 4–12% gradient
sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen). The
separated proteins were transferred overnight to polyvinylidene
difluoride membranes (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ), immuno￾blotted with an appropriate primary antibody, and probed
with a corresponding horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary
antibody.
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Sandwich ELISA: IL-6
and IL-8 concentrations in cell culture media were measured
with sandwich ELISA (R&D Systems) according to the manu￾facturer’s instructions. Detection limits for these assays were
10 pg ml  1
.
HMGB1 direct ELISA: HMGB-1 concentrations in conditioned
media were measured with a direct, home-made ELISA. A total of
100 ml of neat sample or human recombinant HMGB1 (R&D Systems)
was added to a 96-well plate and incubated overnight at
room temperature. The plates were blocked with 3% bovine serum
albumin in PBS and the antigen detection was performed using
2 mg ml  1 of anti-human HMGB1 antibody (mouse monoclonal;
R&D Systems) followed by an anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase￾linked IgG (1:2,000; Sigma). Plates were developed with sub￾strate reagent (R&D Systems) and the reactions were stopped
with 1 M H2SO4. Optical density was measured at the wavelength
of 450 nm using MRX microplate reader (Dynex Technologies,
Chantilly, VA). HMGB1 concentration in samples was calculated
against a seven-point standard curve prepared by performing twofold
serial dilutions of human recombinant HMGB1 with the highest point
of 1 mg ml  1
.
PCR. Quantitative reverse transcription–PCR: RNA extraction was
performed using Absolutely RNA MicroPrep Kit (Stratagen, La Jolla,
CA) or the MagMAX Total Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Reverse transcription–PCR was carried out with Affi￾nityScript Multiple Temperature cDNA Synthesis Kit (Stratagene).

Relative gene expression was measured using SYBR Green JumpStart
Taq ReadyMix.
XBP-1 splicing assay: Total RNA (1 mg) was reverse-transcribed with
AffinityScript Multiple Temperature cDNA Synthesis Kit (Stratagene)
and 20 ng of complementary DNA was amplified with JumpStart Taq
polymerase using a pair of primers covering a 26-nucleotide intron
(nucleotides 531–556) that is spliced out by inositol-requiring enzyme 1
following ER stress induction. DNA fragments were separated on 2%
agarose gel.
Immunofluorescence. Following sample fixation and perme￾abilization, antigens were detected using appropriate primary anti￾bodies. Proteins were visualized using a corresponding secondary
antibody conjugated with FITC, TRITC (DAKO, Glostrup,
Denmark), or Alexa Fluor 633 (Jackson Immuno Research
Laboratories, West Grove, PA). The cell nuclei were stained with
DAPI (Vectra Shield, Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA). Samples were
analyzed using a Leica TCS-SP-2UV confocal microscope (Milton
Keynes, UK).
Flow cytometry. Human epithelial cells: Flow cytometric analysis
was performed to assess the viability of epithelial cells. Cells
were pelleted, resuspended in 300 ml Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium phenol red-free media (Invitrogen), and incubated for 30 min
at 37 1C. Immediately before analysis, the cells were stained with
propidium iodide at a final concentration of 100 mg ml  1
. Analysis
was performed using a FACScan Cytometer (BD Bioscience) and data
were processed with CellQuest Software (BD Bioscience).
Mouse BAL cells: To assess the frequency of neutrophils in BAL,
cells were stained with antibodies specific for CD45 (104), CD11b (M1/
70), and Ly6G (1A8) (all from Biolegend, San Diego, CA). Ultraviolet
fixable live–dead cell stain was purchased from Molecular Probes–
Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA) and used in accordance with the
manufacturer’s protocol. All samples were acquired on a LSRII
flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and analyzed with FlowJo software
(Tree Star, San Carlos, CA).
Statistical analysis. In vitro data were analyzed using Kruskal–Wallis
test followed by Mann–WhitneyU-test or one-way analysis of variance
test followed by unpaired Student’s t-test as appropriate. In vivo
data were analyzed using Mann–Whitney U-test. All results are
reported as mean±s.e.m. Po0.05 was considered to be statistically
significant.
