Abstract
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease with
highly variable clinical presentation. Patients suffer from
immunological abnormalities that target T-cell, B-cell and accessory
cell functions. B cells are hyperactive in SLE patients. An adapter
protein expressed in B cells called BANK1 (B-cell scaffold protein
with ankyrin repeats) was reported in a previous study to be
associated with SLE in a European population. The objective of this
study was to assess the BANK1 genotype–phenotype association in
an independent replication sample. We genotyped 38 single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in BANK1 on 1892 European-
derived SLE patients and 2652 European-derived controls. The
strongest associations with SLE and BANK1 were at rs17266594
(corrected P-value=1.97 × 10−5, odds ratio (OR)=1.22, 95% CI
1.12–1.34) and rs10516487 (corrected P-value=2.59 × 10−5,
OR=1.22, 95% CI 1.11–1.34). Our findings suggest that the
association is explained by these two SNPs, confirming previous
reports that these polymorphisms contribute to the risk of
developing lupus. Analysis of patient subsets enriched for


hematological, immunological and renal ACR criteria or the levels
of autoantibodies, such as anti-RNP A and anti-SmRNP, uncovers
additional BANK1 associations. Our results suggest that BANK1
polymorphisms alter immune system development and function to
increase the risk for developing lupus.
