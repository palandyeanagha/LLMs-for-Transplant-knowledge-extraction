Abstract
BK polyomavirus (BKV or BKPyV) associated nephropathy affects up to 10% of kidney transplant recipients (KTRs). BKV
isolates are categorized into four genotypes. It is currently unclear whether the four genotypes are also serotypes. To
address this issue, we developed high-throughput serological assays based on antibody-mediated neutralization of BKV
genotype I and IV reporter vectors (pseudoviruses). Neutralization-based testing of sera from mice immunized with BKV-I or
BKV-IV virus-like particles (VLPs) or sera from naturally infected human subjects revealed that BKV-I specific serum
antibodies are poorly neutralizing against BKV-IV and vice versa. The fact that BKV-I and BKV-IV are distinct serotypes was
less evident in traditional VLP-based ELISAs. BKV-I and BKV-IV neutralization assays were used to examine BKV type-specific
neutralizing antibody responses in KTRs at various time points after transplantation. At study entry, sera from 5% and 49%
of KTRs showed no detectable neutralizing activity for BKV-I or BKV-IV neutralization, respectively. By one year after
transplantation, all KTRs were neutralization seropositive for BKV-I, and 43% of the initially BKV-IV seronegative subjects
showed evidence of acute seroconversion for BKV-IV neutralization. The results suggest a model in which BKV-IV-specific
seroconversion reflects a de novo BKV-IV infection in KTRs who initially lack protective antibody responses capable of
neutralizing genotype IV BKVs. If this model is correct, it suggests that pre-vaccinating prospective KTRs with a multivalent
VLP-based vaccine against all BKV serotypes, or administration of BKV-neutralizing antibodies, might offer protection
against graft loss or dysfunction due to BKV associated nephropathy.

Introduction
The process of kidney transplantation has been revolutionized
since the first successful case in identical twins more than 5
decades ago [1,2]. Since then, the use of immunosuppressants such
as cyclosporine has made renal allografts a viable clinical option
[3], but the process still has many challenges, including the
management of chronic and acute immune-mediated rejection of
the allograft, nephrotoxicity from immunosuppressants and
antiviral drugs, and controlling opportunistic infections. To
balance these factors, clinical guidelines for the treatment of
kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) generally suggest the use of
intensive immunosuppression during the initial stages of the
process, followed by a diminished dose of immunosuppressants if
there are no signs of acute rejection by 2–4 months after
transplantation [4].
In addition to the potential problem of immunological rejection
of the allograft, between 1 and 10% of KTRs develop
nephropathy associated with a non-enveloped DNA virus species
called BK polyomavirus (BKV or BKPyV) [5–8]. Serological and
PCR-based studies indicate that nearly all human beings are
chronically infected with BKV [9,10]. Although chronic BKV
infection of the urinary tract is not known to be associated with
overt clinical symptoms in healthy individuals, opportunistic
replication of the virus in KTRs can lead to graft dysfunction or
loss [11]. BKV can also cause a bladder condition known as
hemorrhagic cystitis in bone marrow transplant recipients and in
cancer patients treated with the immunosuppressant cyclophos￾phamide [12,13]. Clinical guidelines for these conditions therefore
recommend regular monitoring of serum or urinary BKV viral
load and reduction of immunosuppression if signs of uncontrolled
BKV replication are observed [4].
In pediatric KTRs, being BKV seronegative prior to transplan￾tation correlates with the risk of developing BKV associated
nephropathy (BKVN) [14]. In adult KTRs, at least one study
suggested a significant correlation between donor BKV seroreac￾tivity and the risk of urinary shedding of BKV in KTRs [15].
However, BKV seroprevalence is high in most adult populations
and a variety of other studies have not uncovered clear
correlations between KTR seroresponsiveness to BKV and
resistance to BKV viremia or BKVN [16–18] and reviewed in
[19]. Monitoring of pre-transplant BKV serology is not usually

performed, based largely on the idea that it is not an effective
indicator of susceptibility to BKVN. This logic has also been used
to infer that vaccine-induced boosting of BKV-specific antibody
responses in prospective KTRs would be unlikely to confer
protection against BKVN.
BKV isolates can be grouped into four genetically distinct
subspecies (genotypes) [20–22]. While chronic infection with BKV
genotype I (BKV-I) is believed to be common almost to the point
of ubiquity in all human populations worldwide, PCR-based
studies suggest that BKV genotypes II, III, and IV only infect a
minority of adults. The incidence of BKV-IV infection varies
among different populations, with estimates ranging from ,5% of
BKV isolates detectable in urine specimens contributed by Sub￾Saharan African subjects to 54% of detected isolates from
Northeast Asian subjects [23]. The prevalence of BKV genotypes
II and III appears to be lower than BKV-IV [9]. However, a
complicating factor in these studies is that many commonly-used
PCR primer pairs detect BKV genotype I more efficiently than
other genotypes [24].
The extent of serological cross-reactivity among BKV genotypes
is unclear. Prior serological studies of KTRs have monitored
BKV-specific serum antibody responses using ELISAs where the
target antigens are recombinant virus-like particles (VLPs)
assembled from the BKV major capsid protein VP1. A recent
study [25] using VLPs based on a BKV-III isolate reported
serological findings similar to earlier studies using BKV-I VLPs
[19]. Furthermore, one VLP-based study found a significant
correlation between BKV-II and BKV-III seroresponsiveness in
human subjects [26].
Although past serological studies might seem to suggest a lack of
distinct BKV serotypes, a limitation of VLP ELISAs is that they
simultaneously detect antibodies that can neutralize BKV
infectivity and non-neutralizing antibodies. Viruses are thought
to be under greater selective pressure to accumulate evasive
mutations in capsid epitopes recognized by antibodies that can
neutralize infectivity. In contrast, there is presumably less selective
pressure for viruses to accumulate mutations in virion surfaces
recognized by antibodies that don’t neutralize infection. Conse￾quently, epitopes bound by non-neutralizing antibodies are more
likely to be conserved among related viral genotypes, while
neutralizable epitopes are more likely to be divergent. This poses a
problem for ELISA methodology, since measurement of non￾neutralizing antibody binding may obscure the existence of a
subset of serotype-specific neutralizing antibodies. Consistent with
this theory, we have previously shown that serological assays that
monitor antibody-mediated neutralization of a different family of
non-enveloped viruses, the Papillomaviridae, offer a more effective
way to discriminate among human papillomavirus (HPV)
serotypes than VLP-based ELISAs [27]. Neutralization-based
serological methods also appear to offer an accurate reflection of
the clinical efficacy of recently developed VLP-based vaccines
against HPV [28,29].
In a 1989 study using various cell culture-adapted BKV isolates,
Knowles and colleagues demonstrated that serum antibodies from
animals immunized with virions of one BKV genotype are less
effective for in vitro neutralization of BKV isolates from the other
three genotypes [22]. Whether this serological difference also holds
true for people with chronic BKV infections is not known. For
example, some people with HIV-1 infections eventually develop
antibody responses capable of blocking the infectivity of a wide
range of HIV-1 genotypes. Such broadly cross-neutralizing
antibody responses generally take many years to develop and are
not typically observed in acutely immunized animals (reviewed in
[30] and [31]).
To investigate whether BKV genotypes can be divided into
distinct neutralization serotypes in naturally infected humans, we
developed high-throughput serological assays to monitor antibody￾mediated neutralization of the infectivity of BKV-I and BKV-IV
reporter vectors (pseudovirions). Our results show that BKV-I and
BKV-IV are distinct serotypes with respect to functionally
neutralizing serum antibodies.
Using neutralization assay methodology, we monitored the
development of BKV-I and BKV-IV seroresponsiveness in a
cohort of KTRs. The data show that a substantial fraction of
KTRs who lacked detectable BKV-IV neutralizing antibody
responses one week after transplantation experienced acute BKV￾IV-specific seroconversion during the first year after transplanta￾tion. This may reflect a de novo BKV-IV infection arising from the
engrafted kidney. The findings raise the possibility that VLP-based
vaccination of candidate organ transplant recipients who are
initially naı¨ve against specific BKV serotypes might confer
protection against pathological forms of BKV replication that
are sometimes associated with the implementation of immuno￾suppressive therapy.
Results
BKV type-specificity of ELISAs versus neutralization-based
serological assays
Virus-like particles (VLPs), including BKV VLPs [32], can be
potently immunogenic when administered as vaccines in animal
model systems (reviewed in [33]). To generate BKV VLP vaccine
immunogens, we co-expressed the VP1, VP2 and VP3 capsid
proteins of the BKV-I isolate KOM-5 or the BKV-IV isolate A￾66H via transfection of the human embryonic kidney-derived cell
line 293TT [34–37]. The resulting VLPs were purified by
ultracentrifugation through Optiprep gradients. Five mg of purified
BKV-I or BKV-IV VLPs were mixed with complete Freund’s
adjuvant and administered separately to sets of six mice. Serum
antibody responses were assayed four weeks after a single
vaccination using ELISA plates coated separately with BKV-I or
Author Summary
Serological studies have shown that nearly all humans are
chronically infected with BK polyomavirus (BKV). The
infection isn’t usually associated with noticeable symp￾toms. However, opportunistic replication of BKV in
therapeutically immunosuppressed kidney transplant re￾cipients (KTRs) can lead to dysfunction or loss of the
engrafted kidney. BKV associated nephropathy can occur
even in KTRs with high levels of anti-BKV antibodies that
might be expected to neutralize the virus. In this report we
provide a possible explanation: we show there are at least
two BKV genotypes, which are distinct serotypes with
respect to antibody-mediated neutralization. Using a novel
neutralization-based approach, we found that about half
of 108 KTRs did not have detectable levels of antibodies
capable of neutralizing BKV genotype IV (BKV-IV) at the
time of transplantation. Of these initially BKV-IV naı¨ve KTRs,
about half experienced acute BKV-IV specific seroconver￾sion during the first year after transplantation. This likely
reflects a de novo BKV-IV infection arising from the
engrafted kidney. In a pilot study, we show that
recombinant BKV-IV VLPs can induce high levels of BKV￾IV-neutralizing antibodies in vaccinated animals. Our
results suggest that administration of a BKV VLP-based
vaccine to prospective KTRs might protect against the
development of opportunistic BKV replication.

BKV-IV VLPs. All the mice showed high titer serum antibody
responses in ELISAs against the cognate BKV VLP type, except
for one BKV-I vaccinated mouse which appeared to be relatively
non-responsive (Figure 1, top panel). The sera exhibited varying
amounts of cross-reactivity against the non-cognate BKV. The
average ratio of cognate BKV to non-cognate BKV titer was 21
for mice immunized with BKV-I and 110 for mice immunized
with BKV-IV (Figure 1, bottom panel).
It has recently become possible to generate reporter vectors (also
known as pseudoviruses) based on BKVs [35,36]. These
recombinant production systems made it possible for us to
generate infectious capsids composed of the VP1/2/3 capsid
proteins of BKV primary isolates of genotypes I and IV that are
not otherwise culturable. Using reporter vector-based assays, we
titered the neutralizing potency of sera from BKV-I or BKV-IV
vaccinated mice. As expected, the neutralization assays showed a
significantly greater degree of BKV type-specificity compared to
the ELISAs. The median cognate versus non-cognate neutralizing
titer ratio was 910 for mice immunized with BKV-I and 620 for
mice immunized with BKV-IV (Figure 1). A comparison of ELISA
values to neutralization assay values is shown in Figure S1.
To test the possibility that a booster vaccination might alter the
degree of cross-neutralization of the two BKV types, we
administered the mice a second dose of cognate VLPs in
incomplete Freund’s adjuvant one month after priming. We then
performed repeat serology a total of two months after the initial
priming dose. Hyperimmune sera from the boosted animals
showed neutralizing titer ratios similar to the initial testing (data
not shown), suggesting that boosting did not have a major effect on
cross-neutralization profiles.
Anti-BKV serological titers in healthy adults
Sera from 48 healthy adults with a median age of 52.5 years
were assessed for reactivity to BKV-I and BKV-IV in ELISAs.
Eighty-three percent of the volunteers were seropositive in the
BKV-I ELISA (Figure 2, top panel), a prevalence similar to what
has been reported in the literature [9,10]. Sixty-five percent of
volunteers scored seropositive in the BKV-IV ELISA. This is in
contrast to the purportedly much lower prevalence of BKV-IV
infection, but is consistent with the possibility that the BKV-IV
ELISA detects cross-reactive antibodies elicited by BKV-I
infection (and perhaps vice versa) [31]. The significant correlation
between individual subjects’ BKV-I and BKV-IV ELISA titers
(Spearman r = 0.69, p,0.0001) is also consistent with the
possibility that the BKV-I and BKV-IV ELISAs exhibit a
significant degree of cross-reactivity when used for analysis of
human sera.
We next applied the BKV-I and BKV-IV neutralization assays
to the human serum samples. Only 3 volunteers (6%) were
negative for BKV-I neutralization, while 37 (77%) volunteers
scored seronegative in the BKV-IV neutralization assay (Figure 2,
bottom panel). The increased rate of seropositivity for BKV-I
compared to ELISA suggests that the neutralization assay is more
sensitive. In contrast to the ELISA results, there was not a
statistically significant correlation between the subjects’ BKV-I
and BKV-IV neutralizing titers. There were two individuals with
BKV-I neutralizing titers of .100,000 whose sera did not
detectably neutralize BKV-IV at the lowest tested dilution
(1:100). This indicates that these individuals displayed BKV
type-specificity ratios of at least 1,000. Overall, the results for the
human sera appear to confirm the observations using murine sera,
showing that neutralization assays offer a greater degree of
sensitivity and specificity for serological analysis of exposure to
BKV-I and BKV-IV.
Sequence analysis
To gain insight into which VP1 amino acids might dictate BKV
neutralization serotypes, we aligned full-length non-identical VP1
peptide sequences available via GenBank (Figure S2). With respect
to the BKV-I consensus, BKV-IV isolates tend to carry a variety of
substitutions: E61N, N62D, F66Y, K69R, S71T, N74T, D75A,
S77D, E82D, Q117K, H139N, I178V, F225Y, A284P, R340Q,
K353R, and L362V. Mapping of these BKV-I/BKV-IV variant
residues onto homologous positions in the X-ray crystal structures
of JCV [38] and SV40 [39] suggests that, with the exception of
positions 117, 225, 284, and 340, each of these BKV-I/BKV-IV
variant residues is likely to be exposed on the exterior surface of
the capsid. With the exception of residues 353 and 362, which are
exposed along the floor of the canyons between capsomer knobs,
all the exposed variations map to sites on the apical surface and
apical rim of the capsomer knob. Many of the variations are
adjacent to residues predicted to be involved in binding the
cellular glycolipids that serve as receptors during BKV infectious
entry [40,41]. This is consistent with the idea that BKV-I/BKV￾IV variations may alter epitopes recognized by antibodies that
neutralize infectivity via steric occlusion of the receptor binding
site.
In addition to the differences between BKV-I and BKV-IV, we
noted several positions that differ stereotypically among BKV-I
subtypes. For example, BKV subtype Ib-2 isolates tend to carry
V42L, E82D, D175E, V210I, R340K, and L362V differences,
with respect to subtypes Ia and Ib-1. Likewise, subtype Ic isolates
frequently carry E20D, F225L, and R340K differences. Although
these intra-genotype-I surface variations are chemically subtle, it is
conceivable that the differences reflect selective pressure to escape
neutralizing antibodies. An important goal of future studies will be
investigation of the possibility that BKV genotype I encompasses
more than one neutralization serotype. It will also be interesting to
learn whether the reportedly less prevalent BKV genotypes II and
III are serologically distinct from one another and/or distinct from
genotypes I and IV.
BKV type-specific seroconversion among kidney
transplant recipients
Sera collected from 108 KTRs at time points of roughly 1, 4,
12, 26 and 52 weeks post-transplantation were tested using the
BKV-I and BKV-IV neutralization assays. Testing of more than
500 samples at a full set of 10 serial dilutions would be expensive
and logistically challenging. Therefore each serum sample was
tested at 4 dilutions: 100, 500, 5,000, and 50,000. Because of this
Figure 1. Immunization of mice with BKV-I and BKV-IV VLPs. Six mice were immunized with BKV-I (red circles) or BKV-IV (blue squares) VLPs.
In the top panel, sera were serially diluted and tested in separate BKV-I (x axis) or BKV-IV (y axis) VLP ELISAs. A data point from one relatively non￾responsive animal is shown as an open circle. The middle panel depicts BKV type-specific neutralizing titers for the same set of mice. The gray
diagonal line depicts a theoretical 1:1 correlation (i.e., perfect cross-reactivity) between BKV-I and BKV-IV titers. The bottom panel shows the ratio of
the neutralizing titer for the BKV type administered as a vaccine versus the neutralizing titer for the heterologous BKV type for individual animals. The
wide bar represents the geometric mean and the error bars show the 95% confidence interval. Since the BKV-IV ELISA titer of the non-responsive
animal could not be calculated, this animal was excluded from the analysis in the bottom panel.

lack of full serial dilution, we elected to use a more stringent 95%
neutralization cutoff of for individual data points. Neutralization
assay results for individual subjects are shown in Figures 3 and S3.
At study entry only 5 (5%) patients scored seronegative (i.e., ,95%
neutralizing at the 1:100 serum dilution) in the BKV-I
neutralization assay (Table 1). In contrast, there were 53 (49%)
initially BKV-IV seronegative patients.
In an initial analysis, seroconversion was defined as a change
from seronegative at study entry to at least 95% neutralization at
the 1:500 serum dilution at any subsequent time point. By this
standard, all 5 (100%) of the initially BKV-I seronegative patients
seroconverted for BKV-I, while 23 (43%) of the initially BKV-IV
seronegative patients seroconverted for BKV-IV (Table 1).
The average BKV type-specificity ratio for sera from immu￾nized mice was 1,359 (Figure 1). Two human subjects likewise
showed type-specificity ratios .1000 (Figure 2). To address the
possibility that BKV-IV neutralization might be partly attributable
to cross-reactivity of high titer antibody responses elicited by BKV￾I, we applied a more stringent definition of seroconversion, in
which the ratio of the BKV-I titer versus the BKV-IV titer must be
1,000 or less to be considered a clear type-specific seroconversion
event. Using these stricter criteria, 12 (23%) of the initially BKV￾IV negative patients seroconverted within a year of transplantation
(Table 1).
Based on the results shown in Figures 1 and 2, the occurrence of
BKV type-specificity ratios of 10 or less seems highly unlikely. Five
patients (5%) underwent BKV-IV-specific seroconversion by the
extremely strict criterion of having a BKV-I to BKV-IV titer ratio
#10.
A previous study of this set of subjects used nested PCR followed
by restriction fragment analysis to determine which BKV genotype
was shed in the urine or blood of a subset of patients who became
viruric during the course of the study [15]. Two of four patients
previously found to have shed BKV-IV DNA in their urine during
or after the onset of viruria seroconverted for BKV-IV
neutralization by the extremely strict definition of seroconversion
(Figures 3 and S3). Interpretation of the BKV genotyping data is
restricted by two caveats. First, the nested PCR method used for
the genotyping is likely to detect only the most abundant BKV
genotype present in the sample. This problem has recently been
highlighted by Luo and colleagues in a report showing that BKV￾IV and chimeric quasispecies containing BKV-IV-related se￾quences are often present as minority sequences in urine samples
from KTRs and healthy subjects with viruria [42]. An additional
problem for BKV genotype analysis is that virions found in blood
or urine may originate from the recipient’s bladder epithelium
[43–45] or original kidneys. Such virions might not reflect the
infection status of the engrafted kidney. Interestingly, Randhawa
and colleagues have reported a higher prevalence of BKV
genotype IV (5/25 (20%)), as well as ambiguous BKV genotypes
(5/25 (20%)) in biopsy material from engrafted kidneys affected by
interstitial nephritis [46]. Establishing clear relationships (or lack
thereof) between BKV type-specific serological titer and the
presence of various BKV genotypes in patients at risk of BKVN
will likely require deep sequencing of BKV DNA amplified using
primers that target conserved portions of the BKV genome [24].
Ideally, such analyses would include biopsy specimens from
engrafted kidneys.
On average, the patients’ BKV-I and BKV-IV neutralizing
titers both increased substantially by one year after renal
transplantation (Figure 4). In some instances, titer increases
occurred even in patients who showed moderate neutralizing
antibody titers at study entry (Figures 3 and S3). This result
mirrors data that Bohl and colleagues obtained for this same set of
sera using BKV-I VLP ELISAs [16]. It is unclear whether these
titer increases reflect new cycles of infectious cell-to-cell spread or
emergence of virion production from a latent reservoir, perhaps
arising from the recipient’s bladder epithelium or original kidneys.
Discussion
In this report, we show that BKV-I and BKV-IV are distinct
serotypes with respect to neutralizing antibody responses in human

subjects. Until now, this concept would have been obscured by
that fact that traditional VLP-based ELISAs, which have been
used for prior investigations of BKV serology in human subjects,
do not offer an accurate measurement of BKV serotype-specific
neutralizing antibody responses.
Our longitudinal neutralization-based analysis of archived sera
from 108 KTRs indicates that roughly half of the subjects were
initially BKV-IV naı¨ve at the time of transplantation. Roughly half
of the initially seronegative subjects went on to show evidence of
BKV-IV-specific seroconversion during the first year after
transplantation. A simple model for this result would be that half
of all adults are latently infected with BKV-IV and transplantation
of a latently BKV-IV-infected kidney leads to opportunistic viral
replication in BKV-IV-naı¨ve KTRs. The concept that BKVN is a
consequence of a de novo BKV infection arising from the engrafted
kidney could help explain why the condition rarely affects
recipients of other organ types, despite the use of similar
immunosuppressive regimens [15].
An important implication of our findings is the possibility that
induction of an effective BKV-IV-neutralizing antibody response
prior to transplantation might protect some KTRs against
outgrowth of BKV-IV harbored in the engrafted kidney. This
might, in turn, prevent the development of pathological forms of
BKV replication. The idea that BKV-IV may be disproportion￾ately involved in BKVN is supported by studies showing that BKV
viremia and viruria in KTRs is frequently attributable to BKV-IV
[47–50].
Our results show that a single adjuvanted dose of BKV-IV
VLPs can induce high titer BKV-IV-neutralizing antibody
responses in experimentally vaccinated mice. This suggests that
a BKV-IV VLP vaccine would likely be an effective way to elicit
neutralizing antibody responses in prospective KTRs prior to the
implementation of immunosuppressive therapy.
The potential value of pre-vaccination of KTRs could also
extend to instances where donors and recipients are discordant for
other BKV serotypes. In theory, elicitation of a broadly
neutralizing antibody response against all BKVs might be
accomplished using a vaccine containing VLPs based on multiple
BKV serotypes. A precedent for this idea can be found in the
vaccines Cervarix and Gardasil, which elicit neutralizing antibody
responses against multiple HPV serotypes using mixtures of VLPs
(reviewed in [51]). The clinical efficacy of current HPV vaccines
correlates strongly with serological measurements using HPV
neutralization assays [29]. This suggests that BKV neutralization
assays, such as those reported here, could likewise serve as a useful
proxy for the efficacy of candidate BKV vaccines.
Several previous studies have employed intravenous infusions of
purified immunoglobulins (IVIG) in an attempt to suppress
humoral responses to the engrafted organ and to possibly offer
antibody-based suppression of BKV replication. The results of
IVIG studies have been mixed [52–54]. In theory, this may have
been due to differing levels and serotype specificities of BKV￾neutralizing antibodies in various immunoglobulin preparations. A
possible alternative approach to polyclonal IVIG would be to
administer a cocktail of humanized monoclonal antibodies (mAbs)
capable of neutralizing all BKV serotypes. Neutralization-based
serology approaches should be useful for future determination of
the total number of BKV serotypes and for the development of
candidate anti-BKV therapeutic antibodies.

Committee of the NCI, according to the guidelines of the
Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory
Animal Care International. Procedures were carried out in
accordance with the eighth edition of the National Research
Council of the National Academies’ Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals. All efforts were made to minimize animal
suffering.
Mice and immunization
Eight week old female BALB/cAnNCr mice were immunized
once subcutaneously with 5 mg of BKV-I or BKV-IV virus-like
particles (VLPs, see below) emulsified in complete Freund’s
adjuvant (CFA, Sigma). Sera were collected four weeks after
immunization. The animals were kept under specific pathogen￾free conditions in compliance with institutional guidelines at the
National Cancer Institute (NCI).
Sera
The clinical protocols used in this study have previously been
described in detail [15,17,55]. Briefly, patients were given an
immunosuppressive regimen, which was reduced if viremia was
detected. Serum samples were collected at roughly 1, 4, 12, 26 and
52 weeks post-transplantation. None of the patients were observed
to suffer from BKVN during the course of the collection period.
A previously-described set of sera from healthy subjects visiting
U.S. plasma donation centers were purchased from Equitech Bio
and Innovative Research [56].
urine (superscript u) or blood (superscript b). The subject denoted I/IVu showed urinary shedding of BKV-I at week 5 and urinary shedding of BKV-IV at
week 16. The patterns of 12 representative patients are shown. Results for all 108 study subjects are shown in Figure S3.

Reporter vectors and VLPs
BKV reporter vectors (pseudovirions) were generated as
previously described [56]. BKV-I reporter vectors were produced
using plasmid pCAG-BKV [35], which encodes the capsid
proteins of BKV isolate KOM-5. KOM-5 is classified as a BKV
type I subtype b-1 (Ib-1) genotype [57]. For BKV-IV particles, the
sequence of BKV isolate A-66H (subtype IVc-2) [58] was used to
design synthetic codon-modified VP1, VP2 and VP3 genes [36].
Capsid protein expression plasmids were co-transfected with a
reporter plasmid encoding Gaussia luciferase (phGluc) into 293TT
cells [34]. Forty eight hours after transfection, the cells were
suspended at .100 million cells/ml in PBS and lysed by addition
of 0.5% Triton X-100, and RNase A/T1 cocktail (Ambion). The
lysate was incubated at 37uC overnight to allow capsid maturation,
then clarified at 5,0006g. Reporter vector particles were purified
out of the clarified supernatant by ultracentrifugation through a
27–33–39% iodixanol (Optiprep, Sigma) step gradient [59].
For generation of VLPs, 293TT cells were transfected with
VP1/2/3 expression plasmids without any reporter plasmid. Two
days after transfection, the cells were lysed with 0.5% Triton X￾100 in DPBS supplemented with 25 mM ammonium sulfate,
Benzonase (Sigma), Plasmid Safe (Epicentre) and 1.2 U/ml
neuraminidase V (Sigma #N2876) [60,61]. The lysates were
incubated at 37uC overnight, then adjusted to 0.85 M NaCl,
clarified as above and subjected to purification over Optiprep
gradients.
Maps of the plasmids used in this work and detailed protocols
for reporter vector and VLP production can be found at the
following website: ,http://home.ccr.cancer.gov/LCO/.. Plas￾mids are available through ,http://www.AddGene.org/..
ELISAs
Immulon H2B plates (Thermo) were coated with 15 ng/well of
VLPs in PBS overnight. PBS with 1% non-fat dry milk (blotto) was
used to block the coated plates for 2 hours at room temperature,
with orbital rotation. Sera from mice and healthy human subjects
were serially diluted in blotto and incubated on blocked plates at
room temperature for 1 hour, with orbital rotation. Washing was
performed with PBS. Horseradish peroxidase conjugated goat
anti-mouse IgG (BioRad) or donkey anti-human IgG (Jackson)
secondary antibody diluted 1:7500 in blotto was used to detect
bound antibodies. The plates were incubated with ABTS substrate
(Roche) and absorbance was read at 405 nm with a reference read
at 490 nm. The effective concentration 10% (EC10) was calculated
using Prism software (GraphPad) to fit a curve to the OD values
for each serially diluted serum sample. The top of each dose￾response curve was constrained based on the average of the
calculated plateau maximum (Bmax) values for strongly reactive
sera. The Bmax value was typically an OD of around 2.0, such
that the EC10 value can be considered comparable to an OD
cutoff value of 0.2.
Neutralization assays
Neutralization assays were performed using previously reported
methods [56]. Briefly, 293TT cells were seeded at a density of
36104 per well and allowed to attach for 3–5 hours. Sera from
mice and human subjects were serially diluted, and sera from renal
transplant patients were tested in separate assays at 4 different
dilutions: 1:100, 1:500, 1:5,000 and 1:50,000. Dilutions were
performed in cell culture medium (DMEM without phenol red
supplemented with 25 mM HEPES, 10% heat-inactivated fetal
bovine serum, 1% MEM non-essential amino acids, 1% Glutamax
and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic, all from Invitrogen). Twenty-four
ml of diluted sera were mixed with 96 ml of diluted reporter vector
stock and placed at 4uC for 1 hour. One hundred ml of this
mixture were added to the cells for 72 hours. Conditioned
supernatants (25 ml) were harvested into white 96-well lumino￾metry plates (Perkin Elmer). Fifty ml of Gaussia Luciferase Assay Kit
substrate (NEB) were injected immediately prior to luminometry
using a BMG Labtech Polarstar Optima luminometer. For sera
from mice or from healthy human subjects, 50% neutralizing titers
(EC50) were calculated based on dose-response curves with top and
bottom values constrained to the average values of ‘‘no serum’’
and ‘‘no reporter vector’’ control wells, respectively. For transplant
patients, the following criteria for seropositivity and seronegativity
were adopted: sera were considered negative at entry if the 1:100
dilution did not mediate at least a 95% reduction in Gaussia
luciferase activity (measured in relative light units, RLUs) relative
to the no serum control condition (i.e., .95% neutralization of the
reporter vector). Seroconversion refers to subjects who scored
seronegative at study entry but whose sera became .95%
neutralizing at the 1:500 dilution at any subsequent time point.
A stricter definition of seroconversion, accounting for the possible
low-level cross-type neutralization, added the stipulation that the
95% neutralizing titer for BKV-IV differed from the BKV-I
neutralizing titer by less than 1,000-fold.
Sequence analysis
VP1 protein sequences from BKV strains indicated in Figure S2
were downloaded from GenBank. ClustalW alignments were
performed with MacVector software version 11.1.2 using a
Gonnet series matrix. Structural modeling of BKV VP1 amino
acid variations was performed by aligning the sequences of JCV or
SV40 VP1 to BKV, followed by inspection of homologous
positions of interest in the JCV or SV40 VP1 X-ray crystal
structures (PDB ID accession codes 3NXD and 1SVA, respec￾tively). Structure inspections were performed using Swiss PDB
Viewer [62].
