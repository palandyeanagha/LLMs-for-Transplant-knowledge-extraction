Abstract. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a clinical syndrome 
associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. It has 
previously been reported that stem cells may be considered a 
potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of AKI. The 
present study aimed to determine whether administration of 
urine‑derived stem cells (USCs) to rats with ischemia/reperfu￾sion (I/R)‑induced AKI could improve renal function. USCs 
were isolated and cultured from 8 healthy men. Subsequently, 
USCs transduced with green fluorescent protein were mixed 
with hydrogel and were injected into rats with renal I/R 
injury. Renal tubular injury, proliferation and apoptosis were 
detected in the I/R model. Hematoxylin and eosin staining 
was used to detect the morphological of kidney injury. 
Immunohistochemistry and TUNEL kits used to evaluate 
the proliferation and apoptosis of the I/R model. The results 
demonstrated that USCs could be detected in the tubular 
epithelial lining of the rats and administration of USCs was able 
to improve renal function in the I/R model. The USCs‑treated 
group exhibited significantly reduced serum creatinine and 
blood urea nitrogen levels, decreased tubular injury score, 
an increased number of proliferating cells and a decreased 
number of apoptotic cells. Compared with the control group, 
the mRNA expression levels of the anti‑inflammatory factors 
interleukin (IL)‑10 and transforming growth factor‑β1 were 
significantly upregulated, whereas the expression levels of the 
proinflammatory factors interferon‑γ and IL‑1β were signifi￾cantly reduced in the USCs‑treated group. These findings 
suggested that USCs may promote kidney repair and improve 
function following ischemic AKI, which may be useful in 
treating human kidney disease.
Introduction
Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a multifactorial syndrome, which 
is classically described as a rapid and progressive loss of renal 
function. Despite improvements in intensive care and dialysis, 
the prevalence of cardiovascular disease and sepsis has 
increased, and the rates of mortality and morbidity associated 
with AKI remain elevated, which may be attributed to an ageing 
population (1). Between 1988 and 2002, the incidence of AKI 
in America rose from 61 to 288 per 100,000 individuals (2) 
and in England it was 577 per 100,000 in 2015 (3). Patients 
with AKI who are treated with renal replacement therapy 
still have a mortality rate between 50 and 60% (4). Therefore, 
the generation of more effective therapeutic strategies for the 
treatment of AKI is required.
Renal tubular impairment is thought to be the main patho￾logical alteration associated with AKI. The regeneration of 
necrotic tubular epithelial cells directly affects the prognosis 
of patients with AKI. In recent years, novel strategies have 
been explored that promote the repair of renal tubular epithe￾lial cells. Stem cells or progenitor cells, such as embryonic 
stem cells (ESCs), bone marrow‑derived mesenchymal stem 
cells (BMSCs), adipocyte‑derived mesenchymal stem cells 
(AMSCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), are 
considered a promising strategy in kidney regeneration (5‑8). 
ESCs are an inexhaustible source for cell replacement therapy; 
however, the use of human ESCs is controversial due to the 
opposition surrounding use of embryos. In addition, isolation 
of BMSCs and AMSCs is painful and also raises ethical issues. 
iPSCs are easily generated from human cells, without fear 
of immunological rejection; however, their safety is questio￾nable due to the risk of teratoma formation. Therefore, a more
reliable method for generating in vitro stem cells is required.
Urine may be a convenient source of stem cells, which 
could be obtained noninvasively. Urine‑derived stem

cells (USCs) belong to a stem cell population that exhibits 
self‑renewal and multilineage differentiation abilities. USCs 
are isolated from voided urine, which may be considered 
for tissue engineering applications in urology. Due to the 
differentiation potential of USCs, they could be considered 
a potential therapy for the treatment of kidney disease (9‑11). 
The present study aimed to test the hypothesis that treatment 
with USCs could improve renal function and attenuate tubular 
injury in rats with ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)‑induced AKI. 
If found effective, USCs may be considered useful for the 
development of bioartificial organs or cell‑based therapies in 
kidney disease treatment.
Materials and methods
Ethics statement. The individuals recruited to the present study 
provided written informed consent prior to donating urine 
for stem cell generation. All experiments involving human 
subjects and animals were approved by the Ethics Committee 
and Medical Laboratory Animal Center of Shanghai Jiao 
Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital (Shanghai, 
China).
Isolation and proliferation of USCs. Urine samples were 
donated from 8 healthy men with a mean age of 25 years 
(age, 22‑28 years). USCs were collected, cultured and iden￾tified as previously described (12). Cells were cultured in 
Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; 11960‑051; 
Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) 
supplemented with 2% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Gibco; 
Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.), 10 ng/ml human epidermal 
growth factor (Peprotech, Inc., Rocky Hill, NJ, USA), 
2 ng/ml platelet‑derived growth factor (EMD Millipore, 
Billerica, MA, USA), 1 ng/ml transforming growth factor 
(TGF)‑β (Peprotech, Inc.), 2 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth 
factor (bFGF; Sigma‑Aldrich; Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, 
Germany), 0.5 µM cortisol (Sigma‑Aldrich; Merck KGaA), 
25 µg/ml insulin (Humulin; Eli Lilly and Company, 
Indianapolis, IN, USA), 20 µg/ml transferrin, 549 ng/ml 
adrenaline, 50 ng/ml triiodothyronine, 4 mM L‑glutamine 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) and 20 units/ml PEN/STREP 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). Cells from passage 4 were 
used for subsequent experiments.
Flow cytometry. Cell surface marker proteins of USCs were 
detected using flow cytometry, according to a previously 
reported method (12). The following monoclonal antibodies 
were used: Cluster of differentiation (CD) 29‑phycoerythrin 
(PE; 561795; BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA), 
CD34‑allophycocyanin (cat. no. 560940; BD Biosciences), 
CD45‑PE (560975; BD Biosciences), CD73‑PE (cat. 
no. 561014; BD Biosciences), CD90‑FITC (cat. no. 561969; BD 
Biosciences) and human leukocyte antigen (HLA)‑DR‑PE (cat. 
no. 560943; BD Biosciences).
USCs transduction. USCs at logarithmic growth phase, 
with a density of 30‑50% in a 25‑cm2 flask were transduced 
with green fluorescent protein (GFP) using a GFP lenti￾virus (Shanghai GeneChem Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) 
according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, the GFP 
lentivirus (1x107 TU/ml) was suspended in 100 ml DMEM, 
and the cells were cultured at 37˚C in an incubator containing 
5% CO2 for 4 h. Subsequently, the supernatant was discarded 
and the cells were further cultured for 24‑48 h.
Rat model of renal I/R injury. A total of 36 healthy Male 
Sprague‑Dawley rats (weight, 180‑200 g; aged 8‑10 weeks) 
were provided by Shanghai Jiao Tong University Medical 
Laboratory Animal Center (Shanghai, China). During 
the experiment, the rats were housed at 20‑25˚C and 
40‑70% humidity, with a 12‑h light/dark cycle. All rats had 
free access to standard rat chow and water. To generate an AKI 
rat model, following a mid‑abdominal laparatomy, the kidneys 
were exposed and the right kidney was removed. The left renal 
pedicle was dissected to expose the left renal artery, which was 
clamped with an atraumatic vascular clamp for 45 min under 
a surgical microscope. Then the artery clamp was loosened 
and the hydrogel injected. The wound was sutured immedia￾tely after confirming that there was no active bleeding in the 
abdominal cavity, ~2 min.
30 rats were randomly divided into the treated and control 
groups (n=15 rats/group), the other 6 rats were considered as 
sham‑operated group. In the treated group 1x105 USCs mixed 
with 50 µl sucrose solution (10%, w/v), 50 µl hydrogel and 
100 µl PBS were immediately injected into the upper, middle, 
and lower cortex of the left kidney. Then 5 rats were sacrificed 
at 1, 7 and 14 days following the injection and blood and kidney 
tissues were collected. The blood serum creatinine (Scr) and 
blood urea nitrogen (Bun) levels were detected by fully auto￾matic biochemical analyzer (AU2700; Olympus Corporation, 
Tokyo, Japan). In the control group, rats were treated identi￾cally; however, the rats were treated with mixture of 50 µl 
sucrose solution (10% w/v), 50 µl hydrogel and 100 µl PBS. 
Sham‑operated rats underwent similar operative procedures 
but without clamping of the left renal artery and right kidney 
nephrectomy.
Tubular injury morphological evaluation. Kidney samples 
were fixed by 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h at room tempera￾ture immediately after separation off the organism, dehydrated 
by a graded series of ethanol, embedded in paraffin and then 
sectioned at 5 µm. The sections were stained with hematoxylin 
and eosin (H&E) and the degree of tubular injury was scored 
according to a previously reported method (13). The observa￾tion and image collection were performed using an inverted 
microscope (DM4000B; Leica Microsystems GmbH, Wetzlar, 
Germany) For each kidney, 100 cortical tubules from ≥10 
different areas were scored; the maximum score per tubule 
was 10 and higher scores indicated more severe damage. Points 
were given for the presence and extent of tubular epithelial cell 
flattening (1 point), brush border loss (1 point), cell membrane 
bleb formation (1 or 2 points), interstitial edema (1 point), cyto￾plasmic vacuolization (1 point), cell necrosis (1 or 2 points) 
and tubular lumen obstruction (1 or 2 points).
Immunohistochemistry. The fresh kidney tissues were frozen to 
‑25˚C using a freezing microtome (CM1520; Leica Microsystems 
GmbH), embedded in OTC tissue freezing medium (0201 
08926; Leica Microsystems GmbH). When the OCT embedded 
sections turned into a white solid, the embedded tissue blocks 

MOLECULAR MEDICINE REPORTS 16: 5541-5548, 2017 5543
were sectioned at 5‑7 µm. Then the sections were fixed in 
4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. The 
paraffin‑embedded kidney sections were deparaffinized with 
xylene and rehydrated in a graded series of alcohol and water. 
Successive incubations in 3% H2O2‑methyl alcohol solution 
(IHC WORLD, LLC, Woodstock, MD, USA) for 10 mifn and 
in 5% BSA‑PBS solution (IHC WORLD, LLC) for 30 min at 
room temperature were used to blocking the endogenous peroxi￾dase and nonspecific proteins, respectively. The kidney sections 
were incubated at 4˚C overnight with the following antibodies: 
Anti‑rat proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA; ab29; 1:200; 
Abcam, Cambridge, UK) and anti‑rat GFP (ab290; 1:75; Abcam) 
were used as the primary antibodies, and goat anti‑mouse IgG 
(H + L) (ab96879; 1:500; Abcam) with was used as the secondary 
antibody. Following washing in PBS, the kidney sections were 
incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 h at room tempera￾ture. The sections were visualized with 3,3‑diaminobenzidine 
(DAB; ZLI‑9019; OriGene Technologies, Inc., Beijing, China). 
PCNA‑positive cell scoring was performed by counting the 
number of positive nuclei in 10 random sections in the cortex 
and outer medulla under magnification, x40. The observation 
and image collection were performed using a fluorescence 
microscope (DMI6000B; Leica Microsystems GmbH).
Tubular epithelial cell apoptosis was quantitated using 
a TUNEL assay (G3250; Promega Corporation, Madison, 
WI, USA), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 
kidney sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated, digested 
with protein K and labeled with TUNEL reaction mixture 
for 60 min at 37˚C. Then the sections were stained by DAB 
and the reaction was terminated when a brown background 
was observed under the microscope (DMI6000B; Leica 
Microsystems GmbH). Subsequently, TUNEL‑positive cells 
were counted in 20 random sections in the cortex and outer 
medulla under magnification, x40. The number of apoptotic 
cells, as defined by nuclear fragmentation, was counted.
Reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction 
(RT‑qPCR). Total RNA was extracted from the kidney tissues 
using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, 
Inc.). Subsequently, 1 µg RNA was reverse transcribed using 
the Fermentas RevertAid™ First Strand cDNA Synthesis kit 
(Fermentas; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Pittsburgh, PA, 
USA) according to the manufacturer's protocols. RT‑qPCR 
was performed on a 7900 Real‑Time PCR system using 
TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Roche Diagnostics, 
Indianapolis, IN, USA). The thermocycling conditions were 
95˚C for 60 sec, followed by 40 cycles of 95˚C for 15 sec, 60˚C 
for 15 sec and 72˚C for 45 sec. Primer sequences used for 
RT‑qPCR are presented in Table I. GAPDH expression was 
used as an endogenous control and the 2‑ΔΔCq method was 
used to quantified to the results (14).
Statistical analysis. Data of 3 times repeated experiments are 
presented as the mean ± standard error of the mean. Statistical 
analyses were performed using SPSS version 11.0 (SPSS, 
Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and GraphPad Prism 5.0 (GraphPad 
Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA). The Mann‑Whitney U test 
was used to statistically analyze the results. P<0.05 was 
considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.

5544 TIAN et al: HUMAN USCs CONTRIBUTE TO REPAIR OF ISCHEMIC ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY IN RATS
USCs exhibited typical fibroblast‑like morphology, exhibited 
proliferative capabilities and reached 80‑90% confluence 
after 10 days. USCs retained their elongated morphology after 
numerous passages.
Cell surface marker expression in USCs. Among the 
predefined CD markers, USCs exhibited positive expression 
of CD29, CD73 and CD90 antigens, and negative expression 
of CD34, CD45 and HLA‑DR (Fig. 1). The present study 
demonstrated that USCs have similar surface antigen markers 
to ASCs.
Treatment with USCs improves kidney function following I/R 
injury. Administration of USCs improved renal function in 
rats at day 1 and 7 (Fig. 2). Serum creatinine (Scr) and blood 
urea nitrogen (Bun) levels were significantly decreased in the 
treated group at day 1 (Fig. 2B and C). As determined by H&E 
staining, tubular necrosis with lumen expansion, flattened 
tubular epithelial cells and brush border loss were observed 
in the treated and control groups, compared with in the 
sham‑operated rats (Fig. 2A). However, tubular injury scores 
in the treated group were significantly lower than in the control 
group (Fig. 2D).
Apoptosis and proliferation of tubular epithelial cells. The 
apoptosis and proliferation of tubular epithelial cells from the 
kidneys of control and USCs‑treated rats were subsequently 
determined. Tubular epithelial cells from the kidneys of 
USCs‑treated rats exhibited a lower apoptotic index compared 
with the control rats, as determined by TUNEL assay (Fig. 3A 
and B). In addition, administration of USCs simultaneously 
increased the number of PCNA‑positive cells compared with 
in the control group (Fig. 3C and D). However, no apoptosis 
and proliferation were found in the tubular epithelial cells of 
the sham group.
mRNA expression levels of inflammatory factors. To further 
investigate the potential underlying mechanisms of USCs, 
kidneys underwent RT‑qPCR to determine alterations 
in the expression levels of growth factor‑associated and 
inflammatory‑associated genes. The genes assessed included 
anti‑inflammatory cytokines [interleukin (IL)‑10, bFGF, 
TGF‑β1] and proinflammatory cytokines (TNF‑α, IFN‑γ, 
IL‑1β).
Kidneys of the rats treated with USCs exhibited a 
significant reduction in the mRNA expression levels of the 
proinflammatory cytokines IFN‑γ and IL‑1β, whereas the

total of 7 days after USCs administration, GFP was detected 
(Fig. 5A). Immunohistochemistry of kidney specimens 
demonstrated that GFP‑positive staining was present in tubular 
epithelial cells, not in glomerular cells (Fig. 5B).
Discussion
The present study demonstrated that administration of USCs 
was able to improve renal function in an I/R model. Following 
injection of USCs into the kidney of a rat model, USCs were 
detected in the tubular epithelial lining. The USCs‑treated 
group exhibited significantly reduced Scr and Bun levels, a 
decreased Paller's tubular injury score, an increased number 
of proliferating cells and a reduced number of apoptotic cells. 
Compared with the control group, in the USCs‑treated group, 
the mRNA expression levels of the anti‑inflammatory factors 
IL‑10 and TGF‑β1 were significantly upregulated, whereas the 
expression levels of the proinflammatory factors interferon 
(INF)‑γ and IL‑1β were significantly reduced.
I/R injury largely contributes to AKI in clinical prac￾tice, and the main pathological alterations are acute tubular 
necrosis, apoptosis and inflammation. At present, renal 
replacement therapy remains the standard treatment for renal 
I/R injury (15). Recovery from renal I/R injury depends 
predominantly on the replacement of necrotic tubular epithe￾lial cells with functional cells. However, the kidney itself has 
a limited regenerative capacity for increasing the number of 
tubular cells after AKI (16,17). Although numerous drugs 
and biological factors have been revealed to be effective in 
the amelioration of AKI in animal models, there remains no 
significantly effective novel therapy that has been applied in 
clinical practice (18). Notably, the present study demonstrated 
that GFP‑labeled USCs were localized to the tubular epithe￾lial lining, indicating that some USCs may differentiate into 
tubular epithelial cells and participate in reconstruction of the 
injured kidney, thereby restoring renal function.
In the present study, USCs markedly promoted kidney 
tubular cell proliferation to repair I/R injury, as suggested 
by the increased number of PCNA‑positive cells detected 
in the USCs‑treated rats compared with the control group 
rats that were administered hydrogel with sucrose solution. 
Furthermore, reductions in Paller's tubular injury score and 
the number of TUNEL‑positive apoptotic cells indicated that 
USCs could alleviate renal tubular epithelial cell injury and 
apoptosis, thereby ameliorating I/R injury.
The specific mechanisms underlying renal I/R injury have 
yet to be fully elucidated (19,20). Previous studies regarding 
the pathogenesis of I/R injury have focused on the following 
aspects: Mechanisms of action of inflammatory cytokines, 
and the function of neutrophils, oxygen‑free radicals and 
other factors (21‑25). Among these aspects, the production of 
inflammatory cytokines is considered an important factor in 
the development of I/R injury. Numerous studies have reported 
that BMSCs are effective in the treatment of AKI (6,26,27). 
The effects of MSCs are primarily mediated via complex para￾crine actions, including the secretion of beneficial factors and 
the activation of signal proteins (28). In addition, a previous 
report indicated that adipose derived stem cells (ASCs) 
therapy may improve functional parameters and reduce the 
progression of renal fibrosis during the early and late stages 
following injury, decrease the expression levels of IL‑6 and 
TNF, and increase the expression levels of IL‑4, IL‑10 and 
heme oxygenase‑1 (29).
Our previous study demonstrated that USCs have similar 
surface antigen markers to ASCs (12). However, to the best

of our knowledge, the beneficial effects of USCs on kidney 
disease have yet to be thoroughly investigated. USCs have 
numerous advantages to MSCs and ASCs, as they have a 
rich source, and are non‑invasive and low cost. Therefore, the 
present study focused on the mechanism of action of USCs on 
AKI.
The present study observed significant differences in 
the expression of inflammatory cytokines, including IL‑10, 
TGF‑β1, IFN‑γ and IL‑1β, in kidneys from USCs‑treated 
rats compared with control rats. It is well known that IL‑10 
and TGF‑β1 exert protective effects on I/R injury. It has been 
reported that deficiency in TGF‑β1 expression may increase 
the severity of renal injury, as indicated by more severe renal 
tubular damage, and increased levels of Scr and Bun, and 
TGF‑β1 deficiency may result in an increased risk of renal 
I/R injury (30). In addition, it has been demonstrated that 
increased IL‑10 production may protect animals from renal I/R 
injury (31). IL‑10 may attenuate inflammation by suppressing 
the activation of nuclear factor‑κB, which is involved in renal 
I/R injury (32). IFN‑γ is an important signal in I/R injury, 
which contributes to reperfusion injury, as well as IL‑1β. 
Day et al reported that CD4+ T lymphocytes were important 
in the early stage of reperfusion‑induced inflammation, and 
IFN‑γ was an essential mediator of CD4+
 T cell‑induced 
reperfusion injury (33). Previous studies have demonstrated 
that AKI was associated with increases in the levels of IL‑1β
in the kidney, and IL‑1β has been revealed to act as a proximal 
mediator of inflammatory events associated with infection, 
sepsis and ischemia (34).
The present study demonstrated that administration 
of USCs is associated with increased expression of the 
anti‑inflammatory factors IL‑10 and TGF‑β1, and decreased 
expression of the proinflammatory cytokines IL‑1β and IFN‑γ, 
in the kidney. These findings suggested that the mechanism 
by which USCs protect the kidney against I/R injury may be 
associated with the promotion of IL‑10 and TGF‑β1 expres￾sion, and the inhibition of IL‑1β and IFN‑γ expression.
In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that USCs 
could differentiate into renal cells and alleviate renal I/R 
injury in rats. The effects of USCs were mediated by their 
anti‑apoptotic and mitogenic actions, and their effects on 
cytokine production. The successful treatment of I/R injury 
with USCs strongly indicates that USCs may be considered 
a well‑suited type of stem cell for the treatment of kidney 
disease.
