ABSTRACT
When very large hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) and intrahepatic 
cholangiocarcinoma (IHCCs) with insufficient future liver remnants are treated using 
associating liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy (ALPPS), the 
outcome is often poor. We therefore tested the efficacy of a modified version of that 
technique, tourniquet-ALPPS. A review of the literature examining outcomes of HCC 
and IHCC patients treated with ALPPS revealed the incidences of morbidity ≥ III and 
postoperative mortality to be respectively 20.7% and 16.1% among HCC patients and 
50% and 45.4% among IHCC patients. In the present case series, in which HCC and 
IHCC patients were treated with tourniquet-ALPPS, median tumor size was 100 mm 
(range: 70–200 mm). After surgical stage I, there was no morbidity, no mortality and 
the median future liver remnant had increased at day 7 by 76%. In surgical stage 
II, 100% of tumors were resectable (8 right trisectionectomies, 5 with inferior vena 
cava resection). Two patients experienced serious morbidity ≥ IIIB and 1 patient 
died (11%). One- and 3-year overall survival was 75% and 60%, respectively. Thus 
tourniquet-ALPPS appears to be an effective alternative to classical ALPPS for the 
treatment of patients with HCC or IHCC.

INTRODUCTION
Patients with very large hepatocellular carcinoma 
(HCC) or intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (IHCC) 
occupying the entire right hepatic lobe require extensive 
liver resection but are at risk of posthepatectomy liver 
failure (PHLF) because they have an insufficient future 
liver remnant (FLR) [1–12]. In these cases, portal vein 
embolization (PVE) [2, 13, 14] induces increases in 
volume of between 30% and 50% after 4–8 weeks, but 
increases the risk of drop-out by up to 30% [13, 15–19]. 
On the other hand, associating liver partition and portal 
vein ligation for staged hepatectomy (ALPPS) [20–24]
induces hypertrophy faster than PVE (by more than 60% 
in only 7 days), but with higher morbidity and mortality 
[25–36]. Indeed, outcomes of ALPPS for malignant liver 
tumors are discouraging [26], with recent publications 
in the ALPPS Registry [36–39] reporting the poorest 
results for HCC, IHCC and perihilar cholangiocarcinoma 
(PHCC). There is thus no consensus regarding the 
indications for ALPPS in these cases. 
We have developed an original variant of classical 
ALPPS, which we call “ALTPS” (associating liver 
tourniquet and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy) 
[40] or tourniquetALPPS [41]. This technique entails 
a lower surgical risk during the first stage since liver 
bipartition is not performed. In this report, we provide a 
systematic literature review of postoperative morbidity 
and mortality in HCC and IHCC patients treated with 
ALPPS and present postoperative results and oncological 
outcomes in cases of very large HCC (advanced stages of 
Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer) (BCLC) [42] and IHCC

involving the right lobe with a left insufficient FLR treated 
using tourniquet-ALPPS as a hypertrophy technique.
RESULTS
Systematic review of the literature
Hepatocellular carcinoma
Among a total of 101 HCC cases reviewed (Table 1) 
[29, 43–62], 11 patients were female and 90 were male.
Median tumor size was 8.6 cm (range: 3.1–19.4 cm), 
and median age was 56 years (range 32–83). The short￾term outcomes showed that among the 69 patients who 
were ultimately included in the bibliography review, 
36 had at least one complication (52.1%); of those 21 
patients (20.7%) had complications ≥ stage III. Ninety￾day mortality (excluding patients from Serenari et al., 
for whom 1-year mortality was determined) was 16.1% 
(15 patients). Data extracted from the case series [43–55] 
showed one patient who died postoperatively, and there 
were no data available for one other patient. 
Regarding the long-term oncological outcomes of 
the remaining 12 patients, one was lost during follow￾up, and 11 were alive after 2–34 months of follow-up. In 
the hospital series [29, 56–62] and the World Registry of 
ALPPS publications [37, 38, 63], Overall survival (OS) 
and disease-free survival (DFS) ranged from 50–68.6 % 
and 50–87 %, respectively, though follow-up was less than 
18 months (Table 1). 
Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma
Of 12 patients studied in a case series [18, 57, 
64–68] and hospital series [59] (Table 2), 7 were female 
and 5 were male. Median tumor size was 13.5 cm (range: 
7–18 cm), and the median age of the patients was 61.5 
years (range: 46–72 years). Among the short-term 
outcomes of these patients, 11 (91.6%) had postoperative 
complications, 6 of which were considered severe (50%), 
and 5 patients died (41.6%). Long-term oncological 
outcomes published in the World Registry of ALPPS 
series [37, 63] reported the OS and DFS to be 73% and 
31%, respectively, after 1-year of follow-up.
Case series
Demographic data
The patients included 6 men and 3 women with a 
median age of 60 years (range: 45–72). Median tumor size 
was 100 mm (range: 70–200 mm) (Table 3). There was 
retrohepatic vena cava invasion (IVC) of more than 50% 
of its circumference in 5 patients (2 HCC and 3 IHCC). On 
patient with IHCC exhibited invasion of the right portal 
vein and the bile duct causing jaundice (total bilirubin: 
12.3 mg/dl), necessitating insertion of a percutaneous 
preoperative biliary drain. 
Short-term outcomes
Surgical stage 1 was performed without the Pringle 
maneuver. Median blood loss was 50 ml (range: 50–600 ml), 
and surgical time was 125 min (range: 90–150 min). There 
was no morbidity or mortality, and the hospital stay was 
6 days (range: 4–8 days). Median preoperative FLR was 
25% (range: 11–33 %). By postoperative day 7, FLR had 
increased to 45% (range: 31–69 %). The median increase in 
FLR was 76% (range: 50–187.5 %), which corresponds to 
a daily increase of 28.5 ml/day (range: 7.5–110.7 ml/day). 
The preoperative FLR/body weight ratio increased from 
0.40 (range: 0.17–0.62) to 0.77 (range: 0.49–1.18).
Surgical stage 2 was carried out a median of 
13 days (range: 10–15 days) after stage 1, and the 
resectability was 100%. No Pringle maneuver was 
needed in any case. In the 2 HCC patients with hepatitis 
B viral cirrhosis, a right hepatectomy was performed 
in one case and a right trisectionectomy in the other. 
In the remaining 7 patients, a right trisectionectomy 
was performed, associating caudate lobe resection 
and IVC resection in 5 patients (2 HCC and 3 
IHCC) (Table 3). The median blood loss was 750 ml 
(range: 100–1500 ml), and 5 patients were transfused. 
The surgical time was 285 min (range: 150–360 min). 
The median hospital stay was 9 days (range: 5–40 days). 
Five patients had complications ≥ stage IIIA, and 2 were 
≥ stage IIIB Table 3). Two patients presented with PHLF 
and fulfilled International Study Group of Liver Surgery 
(ISGLS) criteria grades A and C. One 58-year-old woman 
with IHCC died due to sepsis and PHLF. She developed 
acute cholangitis caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa
infection on postoperative day 20 due to stenosis of the 
Roux H-Y requiring reoperation. 
Long-term oncological outcome
None of the 3 HCC patients received adjuvant 
treatment, whereas 3 IHCC patients received 6 cycles 
of gemcitabine plus cisplatin. With a median follow￾up time of 46 months (range: 4–60 months), the 1-year 
and 3-year OS were 75% and 60%, respectively. During 
follow-up, there was a recurrence in the lung in an IHCC 
patient alive at 60 months and receiving chemotherapy. 
Two patients died during follow-up: one HCC patient 
with IVC resection died after 5 months due to urinary 
sepsis, one IHCC patient died after 25 months due to 
acute myocardial infarction. Three of the 4 HCC patients 
remain alive after 60, 54 and 4 months, respectively; while 
3 of the 5 IHCC patients remain alive after 60, 54 and 8 
months, respectively.

DISCUSSION
Currently available evidence indicates the incidence 
of morbidity and mortality is high among HCC and IHCC 
patients treated using ALPPS [26, 27, 38, 49, 50, 52, 54, 
57, 58, 69, 70]. In the first edition of the ALPPS World 
Registry [37], the 90-day mortality was reported to be 9%, 
but it was higher for HCC (12%), IHCC (13%), perihiliar 
cholangiocarcinoma (27%) and gallbladder carcinoma 
(33%) than in cases of colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM)

(8%). For that reason, subsequent editions of the ALPPS 
World Registry attempted to identify factors contributing 
to a poor prognosis, either preoperatively or after the 
first surgical stage, in order to prevent futile second 
interventions [39, 63]. 
Treatment of early stage HCC is liver resection or 
transplantation, whereas for patients with BCLS stage B 
HCC, the recommended treatment is TACE or palliative 
treatment. However, recent reports suggest surgical 
treatment can achieve prolonged survival in advanced 
HCC patients [71, 42, 72–74], even patients with IVC 
invasion, as occurred in a patient in this series (60 months 
survival). These findings may justify an aggressive 
surgical approach and support the use of ALPPS in 
patients with BCLC stage B HCC. However, D’Haese 
et al. [38] reported higher 90-day mortality among HCC 
patients than among those with CRLM (31% vs. 7%). 
They concluded that the risk associated with ALPPS 
remains prohibitive for most HCC patients and that 
ALPPS should only be performed in a highly select group

of HCC patients younger than 60 years and with a low 
fibrosis grade. Similar results were obtained by Vennarecci 
et al. [57], who reported a postoperative mortality rate of 
23.1%. In our literature review, we also found mortality 
to be high among both HCC (16.1%) and IHCC (45.4%) 
patients treated with ALPPS. 
Several alternatives to the classical technique have 
been developed in an effort to reduce ALPPS-related 
morbidity [30, 40, 51, 53, 61, 75–78], especially to reduce 
the aggressiveness of stage 1. We started using tourniquet￾ALPPS in our Department in 2011. With this technique, 
stage 1 does not include bipartition of the liver so as to 
minimize blood loss and substantially shorten the surgical 
time. In the present series, despite the large size of their 
tumors, no patient experienced any complications after 
stage 1, and all achieved sufficient hypertrophy after 7 
days to perform stage 2, with no tumor progression. To 
avoid tumor growth after surgical stage 1, 4 HCC patients 
we administered 2 sessions of preoperative transarterial 
chemoembolization (TACE). The surgery in stages 1 and 2 
was performed without using the Pringle maneuver, which 
is used in 24% of patients treated with ALPPS [37]. This 
is because liver partition was not performed in surgical 
stage 1, and in stage 2 the bipartition was carried out on 
the ischemic line left by the tourniquet. During stage 2, 
5 patients were transfused but this was mainly related to 
the extreme liver surgery performed with complete IVC 
resection. 
ALPPS-related mortality is also decreasing (from 
17% to 4% in 2015), especially at centers with experience 
in the technique. Independent factors associated with 
mortality include risk adjustment in patient selection 
(P < 0.001) and use of less invasive techniques in stage 1 
surgery (P = 0.019) [77]. Although our small sample size 
is a limitation, it is noteworthy that there was no mortality 
among the HCC patients in the present series, despite 
performance of a more aggressive surgical technique. The 
only patient who died was diagnosed with IHCC with 
portal vein and IVC invasion, who was a high-risk patient 
due to preoperative jaundice and Roux H-Y anastomosis.
Theoretically, HCC has a lower regenerative 
capacity because it usually arises against a background of 
cirrhosis or fibrosis. However, an earlier study showed that 
ALPPS is technically feasible and safe in HCC patients 
with cirrhosis, in whom it induces significant volume 
increases [57, 79]. D’Haese et al. [38] reported that 
hypertrophy was lower in HCC patients than in CRLM 
patients (47 vs. 76 %; p < 0.002) and was negatively 
correlated with the degree of fibrosis. But surprisingly, 
Vennarecci et al. [57] found that hypertrophy at 7 days was 
greater in cirrhotic patients than in normal liver (71.7% vs 
64.8%, respectively). In the 3 HCC patients treated with 
tourniquet-ALPPS, the increase was 187.5%, 51.7%, and 
42.4%, respectively.
There is currently no general recommendation 
about adjuvant chemotherapy for IHCC [80, 81]. Some 
authors suggest adjuvant chemotherapy in cases with 
lymphovascular and perineural invasion or positive 
resection margins. In the present study, the decision in 
favor of adjuvant chemotherapy (gemcitabine/cisplatin) 
was taken by our interdisciplinary tumor board considering 
tumor staging (large tumors and IVC invasion).
D´Haese et al. [38] reported that after ALPPS, 
OS for HCC patients was significantly shorter than for 
CRLM patients, with a DFS of 8 months for CRLM 
and 12 months for HCC. In a study from Vennarecci et 
al. [57], who reported only a short median follow-up (15 
months), the 1-year OS and DFS for HCC were 74% and 
42%, respectively. The median DFS was only 9 months, 
and 3 of 8 HCC patients experienced tumoral recurrence. 
Schadde et al. [37] reported a 1-year OS of 61% for HCC. 
The results for IHCC were worse, with a 1-year DFS rates 
of 31% (with R0 resectability of 86%). In the present 
series with tourniquet-ALPPS, 1- and 3-year OS for IHCC 
were 75% and 60%, respectively. One patient experienced 
recurrence in the lung at 50 months, but is alive at 60 
months and is currently receiving chemotherapy. In 
the literature review, with a follow-up of less than 18 
months for both HCC and IHCC, DFS was 50% and 31%, 
respectively. 
This study has several limitations in line with 
previously published articles. They are related primarily 
to its retrospective nature and small sample. In the 
present study, however, patients received more aggressive 
treatment due to the higher rate of IVC resection than in 
previously published studies. 
In conclusion, despite the aforementioned 
limitations, tourniquet-ALPPS appears to be a feasible 
option for treatment of patients with HCC beyond BCLC 
classification and with IHCC frequently involving the 
IVC. Tourniquet-ALPPS induces sufficient hypertrophy 
after 7 days with no tumor progression, and it enables 
acceptable long-term outcomes. More studies with larger 
numbers of patients are needed to confirm these results.
METHODS
Systematic review
A systematic review of the English language 
literature was performed based on recommendations of 
the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews 
and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement [84], the 
Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies 
in Epidemiology statement [82], and the Assessment of 
Multiple Systematic Reviews tool [83].
Information sources and database searching 
A medical librarian developed the systematic 
strategy utilized to search the Medline/PubMed, 
EMBASE, Scopus, ClinicalTrials.gov, the Cochrane 

www.oncotarget.com 28273 Oncotarget
Database of Systematic Reviews and the Cochrane Central 
Register of Controlled Trials. The search terms included 
a combination of standardized index terms and plain 
language to cover the terms “ALPPS”, “associating liver 
partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy” 
and “in situ split” as comprehensively as possible. 
Searches were limited to studies published in English 
using the standard limitations provided by the respective 
databases. Key review articles were identified, and their 
reference lists examined for relevant articles. The final 
search was performed in July 2017. Two researchers (VL 
& AN) independently screened bibliographies of relevant 
review articles and publications in the field. The same two 
researchers together screened titles and abstracts from the 
publications. In the event of disagreement, a third reviewer 
(RR) was involved. Refer to Figure 1 for a detailed flow 
schema, which was in accord with PRISMA guidelines. 
Quality assessment
Study quality was assessed with the Cochrane risk 
of bias tool [84] using the following domains: sequence 
generation and allocation concealment; performance 
and detection bias; incomplete outcome data; selective 
outcome reporting; and other bias. Understandably, it 
is not feasible to conduct fully blinded studies for this 
research question, as both the patients and staff know 
the nature of the intervention. Given these difficulties, if 
a study did not mention any blinding of staff or patients 
and it was not possible to contact the authors, the study 
was assumed to be unblinded and therefore at high risk of 
performance and detection bias. It was, however, possible 
for detection bias to be reduced by using standardized 
criteria for complications and discharge and for outcome 
assessors to be unaware of the patients’ allocation.

Data extraction
Data were systematically extracted under the 
following headings: Study Design (e.g., Randomized 
Controlled trial, Registry review, Cohort study, etc), Study 
Population (Dates of recruitment, Number of patients, Age, 
Sex), Indications for HCC and IHCC, Surgical Procedures 
performed, morbidity, mortality and follow-up period.
Data synthesis
Data synthesis was performed using narrative 
methods. Because of the small number of studies assessed 
for methodological quality and the variety of outcome 
measures used, a meta-analysis was not possible.
Case series
Patient selection
Between September 2011 and July 2017, we 
performed one classical ALPPS and 50 tourniquet￾ALPPS. Among the patients treated with tourniquet￾ALPPS, 9 with HCC or IHCC were included in this 
study. Informed consent to be included in the study was 
obtained from all study participants. Tumor staging was 
carried out using the corresponding tumor markers (CEA, 
Ca 19.9, alpha-fetoprotein), CT (Figures 2 and 3), MRI 
and PET-scan. Exclusion criteria included the presence of 
extrahepatic disease and poor performance status (ECOG 
≥ 2, ASA IV). Patients with HCC underwent TACE [85]. 
We assessed 90-day morbidity and mortality and long￾term results. Morbidity was classified using Clavien￾Dindo criteria [86], while PHLF was classified using 
ISGLS criteria [87]. 
Total liver volume (TLV), tumor volume, FLR 
(ml and percentage) and the FLR/body weight ratio 
were calculated. A FLR lower than 25% in patients with 
healthy livers or less than 50% in cirrhotic patients with 
intermediate stage or Child A cirrhosis were considered 
insufficient. A FLR/body weight ratio of less than 0.5 in 
patients with a healthy liver or less than 0.7 in those with 
a cirrhotic liver was considered insufficient.
Surgical technique
 Tourniquet-ALPPS has been described previously 
[40]. In stage 1, after ligation of the right portal vein, we 
do not perform the liver partition. The tourniquet is placed 
within the umbilical fissure or main portal fissure and 
is tightened enough to occlude vascular communication 
between both lobes (which avoids liver transection but 
leads to the desired liver hypertrophy before resection is 
performed). The patients can usually be discharged a few 
days after the first stage. CT scan volumetry is performed 
on the 7th postoperative day (Figures 2 and 3) to assess the 
increase in FLR and FLR/body weight ratio. 
In stage 2, we use the inserted tourniquet as an aid 
for the hanging maneuver, after which liver bipartition is 
performed using an anterior and in situ approach along 
the ischemic line caused by the tourniquet. In case of 
IVC invasion, after resection of the IVC, it was replaced 
with a 2-cm ringed Gore-Tex® graft (Gore®, Newark, DE, 
USA) (Figure 2). Once the patients recovered from the 
surgery, those with IHCC received adjuvant chemotherapy 
in consultation with an oncologist. No patient with HCC 
received adjuvant chemotherapy. 
Statistical analysis 
Statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS 
Statistics 22.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). 
Kaplan-Meier curves were used for survival assessment.
