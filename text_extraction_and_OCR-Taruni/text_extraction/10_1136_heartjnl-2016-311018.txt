Abstract
Objectives Macrophages play a central role in the 
cellular inflammatory response to myocardial infarction 
(MI) and predict subsequent clinical outcomes. We aimed 
to assess temporal changes in cellular inflammation 
and tissue oedema in patients with acute MI using 
ultrasmallsuperparamagnetic particles of iron oxide 
(USPIO)-enhanced MRI.
Methods Thirty-one patients were recruited following 
acute MI and followed up for 3 months with repeated 
T2 and USPIO-enhanced T2*-mapping MRI. Regions of 
interest were categorised into infarct, peri-infarct and 
remote myocardial zones, and compared with control 
tissues.
Results Following a single dose, USPIO enhancement 
was detected in the myocardium until 24 hours 
(p<0.0001). Histology confirmed colocalisation of iron 
and macrophages within the infarcted, but not the non￾infarcted, myocardium. Following repeated doses, USPIO 
uptake in the infarct zone peaked at days 2–3, and 
greater USPIO uptake was detected in the infarct zone 
compared with remote myocardium until days 10–16 
(p<0.05). In contrast, T2-defined myocardial oedema 
peaked at days 3–9 and remained increased in the 
infarct zone throughout the 3-month follow-up period 
(p<0.01).
Conclusion Myocardial macrophage activity can be 
detected using USPIO-enhanced MRI in the first 2 weeks 
following acute MI. This observed pattern of cellular 
inflammation is distinct, and provides complementary 
information to the more prolonged myocardial oedema 
detectable using T2 mapping. This imaging technique 
holds promise as a non-invasive method of assessing 
and monitoring myocardial cellular inflammation with 
potential application to diagnosis, risk stratification 
and assessment of novel anti-inflammatory therapeutic 
interventions.

Introduction
More than one person every minute suffers a 
myocardial infarction (MI) in the USA.1
 Despite 
improved interventional and medical treatments, 
mortality rates following MI remain high and many 
develop heart failure.1
 Postinfarct inflammation 
plays a key role in the recovery of cardiac func￾tion,2 3 and it is a target for therapeutic manipula￾tion to improve clinical outcomes.
After early neutrophil infiltration, monocyte￾derived macrophages dominate the cellular 
infiltrate in the first 2 weeks following MI and 
sequentially coordinate digestion of damaged tissue 
and promotion of infarct healing.2 3 Optimal post-MI 
recovery is determined by the balance between 
proinflammatory and reparative macrophages, with 
uncontrolled early inflammation leading to adverse 
functional recovery.2–5
Ultrasmall superparamagnetic particles of 
iron oxide (USPIO) consist of an iron oxide core 
surrounded by a carbohydrate or polymer coating 
and are small enough to extravasate through 
diseased microvessels, where they are engulfed 
and concentrated by tissue-resident macrophages.6
Accumulation of USPIOs reduces T2* decay time 
and creates signal deficits that can be quantified 
and visualised using T2* MRI.7 8 Thus, USPIO￾enhanced MRI can detect tissue-resident macro￾phage activity and identify cellular inflammation 
within tissues.
In current practice, T2-weighted MRI is used to 
evaluate myocardial oedema after MI.9 10 However, 
these imaging techniques assess myocardial free 
water content and not active cellular inflammation. 
Development of a reliable non-invasive imaging 
technique capable of directly detecting myocardial 
cellular inflammation would be a major advance 
and could potentially facilitate risk stratification 
and therapeutic targeting of macrophages immedi￾ately after MI. Furthermore, this technique could 
provide diagnostic information, serial disease moni￾toring and a measure of treatment response in other 
conditions mediated by inflammatory cell infiltra￾tion of the heart.
In a recent proof-of-principle pilot study,7
 we 
successfully detected inflammation following acute 
MI using USPIO-enhanced MRI. USPIO uptake, 
defined as the increase in R2* (1/T2*) 24hours 
following administration, was seen in the infarct 
zone within the heart. In this study, we hypothe￾sised that we could track the time course of cellular 
inflammation in the 3-month period following acute 
MI using USPIO-enhanced MRI. Our primary aims 
were, first, to determine the duration and distribu￾tion of USPIO enhancement in tissues following a

single infusion and, second, to assess the duration of macrophage 
infiltration of the heart by tracking myocardial USPIO enhance￾ment using repeated USPIO administration, and compare this to 
measures of myocardial oedema using T2 mapping.
Methods
This was an open-label observational cohort study. Patients were 
recruited within 7 days of acute MI. The study was performed 
in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, the approval of 
the local research ethics committee and the written informed 
consent of all participants.
Subjects
Participants were aged 18–80 years and had sustained a recent MI 
according to the third universal definition of MI,11 with 12-hour 
plasma troponin I concentration ≥5000 ng/L. Exclusion criteria 
were known critical stenosis (>95%) of left main stem, ongoing 
symptoms of angina, heart failure (Killip class ≥2), renal failure 
(estimated glomerular filtration rate <30mL/min/1.73m2
) and 
contraindication to MRI or ferumoxytol infusion.
Ultrasmall superparamagnetic particles of iron oxide
Intravenous infusion of USPIO (ferumoxytol, Fe core 3.25nm, 
total particle diameter 17–31nm, 4mg/kg; Rienso, Takeda 
Italia, Italy) was performed immediately following the baseline 
magnetic resonance scan over at least 15min using a concen￾tration of 2–8mg/mL, diluted in 0.9% saline or 5% dextrose. 
Haemodynamic monitoring was conducted throughout.
Study protocol
MRI and tissue histology were performed as described in the 
online supplementary material. A variable study protocol was 
used that was purposely designed for imaging at different time 
points after acute MI. Over a 3-month period following MI, 
patients received up to seven MRI scans and up to three infu￾sions of USPIO. Two principal analyses were performed using 
data from the same participants.
First, to assess the duration of a single dose of USPIO, R2* 
values of only the participants who first received USPIO within 
7 days of MI (21/30) were included in this analysis. They were 
followed on all subsequent MRI scans prior to receiving any 
further doses of USPIO (figure 1A). On receiving further USPIO, 
data were censored from the point of the second USPIO admin￾istration, hence the reduction in numbers during the course of 
the study.
Second, to assess the duration of myocardial macrophage 
activity, USPIO uptake was compared using repeated USPIO 
infusions over the 3-month follow-up period. All patients 
were included in this analysis. USPIO uptake was calculated 
by subtracting the baseline R2* value from values obtained at 
24hours following USPIO infusion (figure 1B). This allowed 
repeated assessment of myocardial USPIO uptake.
Following clinical guidance for the administration of feru￾moxytol, participants were allowed a maximum of two doses 
of USPIO in a 1-month period, and a total of three over the 
3-month follow-up period to prevent iatrogenic iron over￾load. Therefore, USPIO-enhanced data were collected up to 
three times for each patient, and it was not possible to perform 
repeated USPIO-enhanced imaging at every time point in the 
same patient.
Finally, to assess myocardial oedema, T2 values were 
compared on unenhanced scans (prior to and at least 7 days 
following USPIO administration). All patients were included in 
this analysis.
Image analysis
All T2*-weighted multigradient-echo images for each patient 
were analysed using Circle CVI software (Circle CVI42, 
Canada). An experimentally determined threshold used in 
previous work7
 for the coefficient of determination (r2
>0.85) 
was used to exclude data that did not have an acceptable expo￾nential decay when signal intensity was plotted against echo 
time. The relaxation rate, R2*, is the inverse of the mean T2*, 
and was calculated to assess the uptake of USPIO for each region

Special populations
of interest (ROI), where the higher the value, the greater the 
USPIO accumulation.
Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE), ventricular volume 
and functional analyses were determined manually using 
QMass software (Medis Medical Imaging Systems, Leiden, The 
Netherlands).
ROI selection
LGE images at the 3-month time point were used to determine the 
distribution and anatomy of the myocardial infarct, and served 
as reference images to which each series of T2 and T2* scans 
at each separate visit could be visually coaligned. This allowed 
myocardial ROIs to be selected on the reference short-axis LGE 
images and manually applied to T2* images corresponding to 
(1) infarct zone (defined by the short axis slice showing greatest 
LGE volume), (2) peri-infarct zone (half segment width imme￾diately adjacent to LGE), and (3) remote myocardium (at least 
half segment width, opposite the infarct zone on the same short 
axis slice, and at least one full segment clear of any LGE). Other 
selected regions included (4) liver, (5) spleen, (6) bone marrow, 
(7) kidney, (8) blood pool, (9) aortic wall (inside arch) and (10) 
skeletal muscle.
T2 values were measured immediately prior to USPIO 
administration. USPIO-enhanced data were collected 24hours 
following USPIO administration.
Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism, 
V.6 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, California, USA). To 
assess the duration of USPIO enhancement in tissues following 
single administration in the first week after MI, R2* values on 
subsequent MRI scans (prior to any further USPIO dosing) were 
compared using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with 
Tukey’s post hoc test for multiple comparisons.
To assess variation and duration of myocardial inflammation, 
USPIO uptake (R2* increase from pre to 24hours following 
USPIO) was compared using one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post 
hoc test for multiple comparisons (repeated measures where 
appropriate). As a further method to assess USPIO accumula￾tion within the heart, post-USPIO R2* 24hours after adminis￾tration (without baseline R2* subtraction) was compared in the 
same way.
Finally, to assess variation and duration of myocardial oedema, 
T2 values for infarct, peri-infarct and remote myocardium were 
compared again using one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc 
test for multiple comparisons (repeated measures where appro￾priate). Statistical significance was defined as two sided, p<0.05.
Results
Thirty-one patients were recruited although 1 patient was 
excluded due to claustrophobia. A total of 147 MRI scans and 
54 infusions of ferumoxytol were completed during the course 
of the study. Administration of ferumoxytol was well tolerated 
with no adverse reactions reported during or immediately after 
administration.
Participants were predominantly middle-aged men with 
current or previously diagnosed hypercholesterolaemia or 
smoking habit (table 1). Around half of the participants were 
hypertensive and had a family history of premature coronary 
heart disease. Twenty-five patients had ST-segment elevation 
MI, 5 patients had non-ST-segment elevation MI, 26 underwent 
percutaneous coronary intervention, and 4 had coronary artery 
bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. The mean elevation in plasma 
troponin was 31200ng/L.
Enhancement after single USPIO dose
Twenty-one of the 30 participants received USPIO in the first 
week after MI and were included in this analysis.
USPIO was detected by an increase in R2* in all myocardial 
regions, blood pool, kidney and aortic wall until 24hours, being 
cleared by 4–9 days (figure 2, online supplementary figure 1 
and online supplementary table 1). USPIO was detected in bone 
marrow until 4–9 days and in liver and spleen until 13–21 days. 
There was no change in R2* following USPIO infusion in skel￾etal muscle.
Myocardial biopsies were taken from three of four patients 
undergoing CABG and revealed an abundance of inflammatory 
cells and early granulation tissue in keeping with a region of 
healing myocardium from around the infarct zone. Histological 
staining revealed colocalisation of the presence of iron (Prussian 
blue) and macrophages (CD68). No staining for iron or macro￾phages was seen within the adjacent regions of healthy myocar￾dium (figure 2).
Time course of enhancement with repeated USPIO 
administration
There were no differences in baseline (pre-USPIO) R2* value 
between infarct and remote myocardium at all time points. Time 
course variation in USPIO uptake was seen in the infarct zone 
over the 3-month period, peaking at days 2 and 3 (figures 3a, 4
and online supplementary table 2a). There was no time course 
variation in USPIO uptake in the peri-infarct and remote 
myocardium or extra-cardiac tissues over the 3-month follow-up 
period.

Discussion
For the first time, we have simultaneously investigated cellular 
inflammation and tissue oedema for 3 months following acute 
MI using USPIO-enhanced T2* and T2-mapping MRI. We 
have demonstrated that while tissue oedema persists for at 
least 3 months, cellular inflammation in the infarct zone is 
transient and lasts for only 2 weeks following MI. The time 
course of USPIO uptake following MI demonstrates a pattern 
of macrophage inflammation that is distinct to tissue oedema 
caused by the loss of capillary integrity. This suggests that while 
capillary integrity may take several months to resolve, cellular 
inflammation and specifically macrophage activity predominates 
in the first 2 weeks following MI.
USPIO can be used as an MRI contrast agent as it is 
immediately apparent in the blood pool following intravenous 
administration.12 Tissue enhancement with USPIO following 
inflammation has been suggested to occur as a result of either 
partitioning of USPIOs into the tissues because of the loss of 
capillary integrity alone or as a result of macrophage phago￾cytic activity clearing tissue-resident particles.8
 We here provide 
confirmatory evidence that USPIO enhancement predominantly 
occurs as a result of cellular inflammation within the myocar￾dium. We used T2 mapping to describe the loss of capillary 
integrity following MI. Using this comparator, we demonstrate 
that there is a discontinuity between the prolonged (up to 3 
months) T2-defined time course of tissue oedema, and the brief 
(first 2 weeks) T2*-defined time-limited cellular inflammation. 
This observed USPIO uptake in the infarct zone for up to 2 
weeks following MI is consistent with data from previous studies 
demonstrating that tissue-resident macrophages are active and

predominate within the infarcted myocardium in the first 2 
weeks after MI.3 5 In addition, we obtained myocardial biopsies 
in patients undergoing CABG surgery within 2 weeks of MI and 
24hours after USPIO administration. We demonstrated marked 
colocalisation of iron staining with tissue-resident macrophages 
in infarcted but not in non-infarcted tissue. It is not possible to 
resolve specific USPIOs on histology, and we cannot discount 
the possibility that there is some contribution from postinfarct 
haemosiderin staining. However, we would contend that the 
majority of iron staining is attributable to USPIO uptake given 
the selective, transient and marked R2* enhancement on MRI, 
and the relatively constant contribution from haemosiderin 
during the period of assessment. Moreover, we did not detect 
substantial quantities of iron that were free in the extracel￾lular space and were not associated with areas of macrophage 
infiltration.
Following a single infusion in the first week after MI, USPIO 
enhancement is seen in all regions of the myocardium, but 
greatest within the infarct zone, after 24hours. USPIO enhance￾ment is also observed until 4–9 days in bone marrow and until 
13–21 days in the liver and spleen. Therefore, the duration 
of USPIO enhancement is longest in the mononuclear phago￾cyte-rich reticuloendothelial system. It is likely that resident 
phagocytes within these organs ingest USPIOs from circulating 
blood. Efflux of myocardial macrophages containing USPIO 
may also contribute to the reticuloendothelial system T2* signal. 
Ultimately, once within macrophages, the iron oxide core is 
broken down by lysosomes, providing a supply of iron ions for 
haemoglobin synthesis.13 14
The observed duration of enhancement following a single 
infusion of USPIO in tissues helped guide the minimum time 
interval between repeated USPIO administrations. Complete 
washout of the previous dose of USPIO, allowing baseline R2* 
to return to normal, is required to reassess uptake of USPIO 
accurately, without influence from previous USPIO administra￾tion. We have shown that USPIO is no longer detectable in the 
myocardium at 1 week following intravenous administration, 
and we suggest that 1 week is the minimum interval between 
repeated doses of USPIO.
USPIO is detectable in the peri-infarct and remote myocar￾dium, kidney and aortic wall at 24hours following administra￾tion. However, the amplitude of R2* change is less than that of 
blood pool, suggesting this is likely to be due to a diluted effect 
of blood-pool USPIO and not macrophage uptake of USPIO

in infarct and peri-infarct T2 was seen in the 3-month period following

Special populations
within these tissues. Although there appears a trend to suggest 
that the peri-infarct zone displays an early relative increase in 
USPIO uptake compared with remote myocardium, this failed to 
reach statistical significance.
Previous studies have suggested that the remote myocar￾dium may exhibit USPIO and macrophage accumulation.7 8 15
We have shown here that there is no time course variation in 
USPIO uptake in remote myocardium after MI, and the small 
R2* increase following USPIO is likely to be reflective of intra￾vascular capillary-bed blood-pool USPIO rather than more wide￾spread macrophage activity throughout the myocardium. This is 
consistent with our recent report of similar R2* increases in the 
myocardium of healthy volunteers which we again attribute to 
the blood pool signal of USPIO.16
Although no patients in this study displayed imaging evidence 
of myocardial haemorrhage, we were able to account for the 
presence of microscopic iron due to haemorrhage by subtracting 
baseline R2*. Therefore, any R2* increase detected is due to 
accumulation of USPIO and not iron from myocardial haem￾orrhage. We acknowledge that intramyocardial haemorrhage 
occurring between the pre and 24hours post USPIO scans could 
theoretically increase R2*, but the earliest we imaged patients 
was at least 24hours after MI, by which time haemorrhage is 
likely to have taken place.
We chose T2 mapping to assess myocardial oedema as it 
provides improved sensitivity and addresses some of the problems 
with subjective image interpretation using traditional T2-weighted 
techniques.17 18 The finding of ongoing myocardial oedema in the 
infarct zone at 3 months after MI may at first appear surprising. 
However, several groups have described the long-lasting presence 
of myocardial oedema, often up to 6 months after MI.19 20 This 
suggests that it may take many months for complete resolution of 
injury and return of normal vascular homeostasis and function.
What are the clinical applications of our technique? We have 
here used the ‘model’ of acute MI and demonstrated the predicted 
time course of tissue-resident macrophage uptake using USPIOs. 
We therefore suggest that this technique has utility in defining 
the extent of myocardial cellular inflammation that has potential 
utility in risk stratification. Perhaps more importantly, USPIO-en￾hanced MRI may prove a useful tool to assess the response to novel 
anti-inflammatory interventions targeted at reducing myocardial 
cellular inflammation to improve clinical outcomes. Such a study 
was carried out at our centre and has recently been published.21
Currently, there is no USPIO licensed as a contrast agent for 
routine clinical MRI, which limits its widespread use. However, 
the most exciting application would be to extend this technique to 
help diagnose, monitor disease progression and assess therapeutic 
intervention in myocardial diseases associated with and mediated 
by macrophage infiltration. Such diseases include myocarditis, 
cardiac transplant rejection and cardiac sarcoidosis, and a multi￾centre study is currently under way to assess this (EUDRACT 
2013-002336-24). This would be important given the lack of 
simple definitive diagnostic tests in these conditions, the challenges 
of unreliable cardiac biopsies, and the need for rapid assessments 
of disease progression and therapeutic interventions.
In conclusion, we have successfully imaged, quantified and 
validated macrophage inflammation and myocardial oedema 
over 3 months in patients following MI using USPIO-enhanced 
T2* MRI and T2 mapping. This technique can provide a 
non-invasive method for the diagnosis and monitoring of tissue 
inflammatory macrophage activity in the heart. It also provides 
a potential platform on which to assess existing and novel thera￾peutic interventions that might modify the inflammatory process 
after MI and in other inflammatory processes affecting the heart.

Key messages
What is already known on this subject?
► Ultrasmall superparamagnetic particles of iron oxide (USPIO) 
are ingested by tissue macrophages that can be visualised 
using MRI to highlight areas of inflammation after myocardial 
infarction (MI).
What might this study add?
► The pattern of cellular inflammation after MI is distinct to 
tissue oedema. Myocardial macrophage activity is evident for 
2 weeks after MI compared with the more prolonged period 
of myocardial oedema.
How might this impact on clinical practice?
► USPIO-enhanced MRI may be of value in diagnosing active 
MI and ultimately may provide an additional diagnostic tool 
or provide risk stratification and serial imaging in assessing 
inflammatory processes affecting the heart.
