Abstract
The relationship between physical activity
and risk of symptomatic diverticular
disease has not been investigated directly.
This association was examined in a
prospective cohort of 47 678 American
men, 40 to 75 years of age, and free of
diagnosed diverticular disease, colon
or rectal polyp, ulcerative colitis, and
cancer before 1988. During four years of
follow up, 382 newly diagnosed cases of
symptomatic diverticular disease were
documented. After adjustment for age,
energy adjusted dietary fibre, and energy
adjusted total fat, overall physical activity
was inversely associated with the risk of
symptomatic diverticular disease (for
highest versus lowest extremes, relative
risk (RR)=0-63 (95% confidence interval
(CI) 0.45, 0.88). Most of the inverse
association was attributable to vigorous
activity, for extreme categories RR=0.60
(95% CI 0-41, 0.87). For activity that was
not vigorous the RR was 0.93 (95% CI 0-67,
1.69). Several specific activities were
inversely associated with the risk of
diverticular disease, but jogging and
running combined was the only individual
activity that was statistically significant (p
for trend=0.03). For men in the lowest
quintile for dietary fibre intake and total
physical activity (compared with those
in the opposite extreme), the RR was 2.56
(95% CI 1.36, 4.82). Physical activity,
along with a high fibre diet, may be an
important factor in the prevention of
symptomatic diverticular disease.

Diverticular disease is one of the most
common disorders of the colon among the
elderly in western societies,l where it is
estimated to occur in one third of people older
than 45 years of age and in two thirds of those
aged more than 85 years.2 In most cases
the condition is asymptomatic,3 and only
between 10 and 25% of those affected develop
symptoms.2 Symptomatic diverticular disease
results in 200 000 admissions to hospital in the
USA annually.4
Earlier this century diverticular disease
was widely believed to be rare, and was
regarded as a pathological curiosity. This
prompted Burkitt and Painter to call it 'a
20th century problem' or 'a disease of
Western civilisation',5 6 in contrast to its rarity
in many developing countries.7 This sharp
contrast was largely attributed to dietary
differences, mainly in the decline of dietary
fibre intake from cereal grains.5 The dietary
fibre hypothesis is supported by human8-13
and animal studies.14-16 Previous case-control
studies have found that patients consumed
less fibre than controls, and we observed
similar findings in the prospective health
professionals follow-up study (unpublished).
However, other potential risk factors, such as
physical activity, body composition, smoking,
alcohol, coffee drinking, total energy intake,
and other dietary components, might also
explain the difference in rates between
developed and developing countries. Several
studies,'7-20 reported an effect of physical
activity on colonic functions, particularly a
reduction in transit time, suggesting that
activity might also reduce the risk of divertic￾ular disease. This hypothesis, however, has
not been prospectively investigated.
Methods
STUDY POPULATION
The health professionals follow-up study
is a prospective study of heart disease and
cancer among 51 529 US male health profes￾sionals, aged 40-75 years in 1986. The
study began in 1986 when cohort members
completed a detailed food frequency question￾naire and provided information about medical
history, age, weight, height, smoking, alcohol
consumption, physical activity, and history of
professionally diagnosed medical conditions.
Every two years (1988, 1990, 1992) follow
up questionnaires have been sent to update
information on potential risk factors and to
identify newly diagnosed cases of various
diseases. The 1990 and 1992 follow up
questionnaires contained specific questions
regarding diverticular disease.
We excluded a priori from this analysis men
whose average daily energy intake, calculated
from the food frequency questionnaire, was
outside the range of 3.35 to 17.6 MJ (800 to
4200 kcal), and those who left blank 70 or
more food items on the dietary questionnaire.
We also excluded men who reported previous
cancer (other than non-melanoma skin can￾cer), colon or rectal polyp, ulcerative colitis,
and diverticular disease before 1988. After
exclusions, the eligible baseline population
consisted of 47 678 men.

Prospective study ofphysical activity and the risk of symptomatic diverticular disease in men
ASSESSMENT OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY
The 1986 baseline questionnaire included a
self reported assessment of mainly recreational
physical activity. The reliability and validity of
using questionnaires to assess physical activity
have been investigated,21 23 and a similar
questionnaire to the one used in this cohort
was validated in a cohort of US women.24
Eight moderate or vigorous activities were
listed on the questionnaire and participants
were asked to report the average time per week
spent at each activity: there were 10 possible
responses ranging from 0 min to - 11 h/wk.
We also inquired about the number of flights of
stairs climbed daily, usual walking pace and, in
the 1988 follow up questionnaire, about the
time spent watching video and television:
there were six possible responses ranging
from 0-1 h/wk to ¢41 h/wk. Subjects who
completed none of the activity responses were
excluded from the analysis. The contribution
of each activity was based on its energy
expenditure requirements in METs,25
multiplied by the duration of the activity. One
MET is defined as the energy expended sitting
quietly which is equivalent to 3.5 ml of oxygen
uptake per kg of body weight per minute for a
70 kg adult. Body weight was not included
in the derivation of energy expenditure of
physical activity (kcallwk), because this could
induce confounding by body weight, which is
itself usually associated with physical activity.
If more than one published intensity level was
available for a given activity, the moderate or
general MET value was chosen. An average
MET value was assigned for the categories that
listed more than one activity (for example,
rowing and callisthenics, or squash and
racquetball). The contributions from each
activity were summed to give a physical activity
index in total METs expressed as h/wk.
We further classified sports and other
recreational activities into vigorous and non￾vigorous activities according to their intensity.
Sports with a score of MET value <6 METs
were considered non-vigorous, and those
scoring 2,6 METs as vigorous. Accordingly, the
non-vigorous activities included walking or
hiking outdoors, and stair climbing. The
vigorous activities included jogging (slower than
10 min/mile), running (10 min/mile or faster),
bicycling (including stationary machines). lap
swimming, calisthenics or rowing, squash or
racquetball, and tennis.
OTHER VARIABLES
To assess dietary intake, we used a semiquan￾titative food frequency questionnaire that was
validated in this cohort.26 The questionnaire
included 131 food items plus vitamins and
mineral supplements that collectively account
for over 90/o of the major nutrients consumed
by participants. The values for dietary fibre
were based on the work of Southgate et al.27 28
The body mass index (BMI) was computed in
metric units (by dividing the weight in kg by
the height in m2) from the participants' reports
in the 1986 baseline questionnaire of their own
height in inches and weight in pounds. Total
energy intake was computed from the
participants' reported intake of food items and
alcohol on the food frequency questionnaire.26
IDENTIFICATION OF DIVERTICULAR DISEASE
CASES
Follow up questionnaires were sent to all
study participants in 1988, 1990, and 1992.
In the 1990 and 1992 questionnaires we
asked whether diverticular disease had been
diagnosed during the previous two years
(diverticular disease was not a specified end
point in the 1988 follow up questionnaire).
After up to six mailings for each follow
up period, the response rates were 96% in
1990 and 94°/O in 1992 (as of the time of this
analysis). When diverticular disease was
reported on the follow up questionnaire, we
mailed the cohort member a supplementary
questionnaire to confirm the reporting, and to
ascertain the date of diagnosis, the presence
and nature of any symptoms, the procedure
performed to confirm the diagnosis (for exam￾ple, barium study or endoscopy), treatment,
and whether there were any dietary changes

induced by symptoms which occurred before
the diagnosis. We obtained 182 medical
records from a sample of participants who
reported diverticular disease to assess the
validity of self reporting, and to ascertain the
site of the diverticula. The records confirmed
the self reporting in 95% of the cases. We
therefore accepted the other self reports of
diverticular disease as valid. In addition, 96%
of the cases were located in the left colon
(sigmoid, descending, or mid-transverse
colon), as would be expected in a predomi￾nantly white population.29 We included in
the analysis the cases diagnosed during the
four years of follow up - 1 February 1988 to
31 January 1992.
In the population eligible for analysis,
we identified 500 newly diagnosed cases of
diverticular disease. Of these, 382 were
classified as symptomatic (presenting with
pain, change in bowel habits, or bleeding),30
and 118 cases were classified as asymptomatic
(the diverticula were discovered during a
routine screening). To reduce the possibility
of detection bias, we used symptomatic
diverticular disease as our primary end point.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Participants were categorised according to
quintiles of total physical activity, non￾vigorous activity, BMI, height, and total
energy intake, and by four categories of
vigorous activity (58% of participants were
engaged in vigorous activities). For each
participant, the follow up time was calculated
as the number of months between 1 February
1988 and the date of diagnosing diverticular
disease or death, or 31 January 1992,
whichever came first. The relative risk - the
incidence among the men in different exposure
categories divided by the corresponding rate in
the reference category - was used as the
measure of association.3' Age adjusted rates
were calculated with the use of five year
categories. The Mantel extension test32 was
used to evaluate linear trends across categories
of different variables. Other potentially
confounding variables were modelled with
multiple logistic regression. These variables
included alcohol consumption, smoking,
coffee intake, and other dietary variables (such
as total fat and saturated fat). The variables
were derived from the baseline questionnaire
completed by the participants in 1986.
The p values are all two tailed, and for all
relative risks we calculated the 95% confidence
interval.33
Results
During 187 439 person years of follow up over
a period of four years, 382 cases of sympto￾matic diverticular disease were documented in
this cohort. The predominant symptoms were
abdominal pain (63%), bleeding (18%), and
change in bowel habits (8%). Age adjusted
total energy intake and height were not signifi￾278

cantly associated with the risk of diverticular
disease (p for trend=0.47 for energy, 0.31 for
height) (see Table I). We observed a positive
association between the age adjusted BMI and
the risk of symptomatic diverticular disease
(p for trend=0.05) (see Table I). The associa￾tions between total energy intake, BMI, height,
and risk of symptomatic diverticular disease
were attenuated, when assessed separately in
multivariate models with age, physical activity,
energy adjusted dietary fibre, and energy
adjusted total fat, and none was statistically
significant (see Table I).
We examined the relationships of age
adjusted total physical activity, vigorous
activity, and non-vigorous activity with the risk
of symptomatic diverticular disease. Total
physical activity was inversely associated with
the risk of symptomatic diverticular disease.
Compared with men in the lowest quintile of
physical activity, those in the highest quintile
had a relative risk of 0 57 (95% CI 0.41, 0.79).
Nearly all of this inverse association was attrib￾utable to the vigorous activities. The RR
comparing extreme categories of vigorous
activity was 0 53 (95% CI 0.37, 0 75).
In contrast, non-vigorous activity was not
appreciably associated with risk of sympto￾matic diverticular disease (RR=0.93, 95% CI
0-67, 1.30) (see Table II). When we analysed
separately total physical activity, vigorous
activity, and non-vigorous activity in multi￾variate models with age, energy adjusted
dietary fibre, and energy adjusted total fat, our
findings did not change appreciably from those
in the age adjusted model (see Table II).
When we included vigorous activity and
non-vigorous activity simultaneously in the
multivariate model with age, energy adjusted
dietary fibre, and energy adjusted total fat, our
findings did not change appreciably (RR for
vigorous activity=0-60, 95% CI 0.41, 0.87;
RR for non-vigorous activity=0-93, 95% CI
0.67, 1-29). Vigorous activity accounted for
61 % of the total physical activity score.
Television viewing or video watching, an
important indicator of inactivity,34 was
positively associated with the risk of sympto￾matic diverticular disease (p for trend=0.006)
(see Table II).
We also examined the various specific sports
and recreational activities on the list in relation
to the risk of symptomatic diverticular disease
(see Table III). Several specific activities
tended to be inversely associated with the risk
of symptomatic diverticular disease, though
most were not statistically significant. Age
adjusted jogging and running combined,
cycling, and racquet sports were the only sport
activities that were statistically significant

(p for trend=0.007 for jogging and running;
p for trend=0.03 for cycling; p for trend=0.03
for racquet sports). When cycling, racquet
sports, and jogging and running were analysed
separately in a multivariate model including
age, energy adjusted dietary fibre and energy
adjusted total fat, cycling and racquet sports
were no longer significant, while jogging
and running retained statistical significance
(see Table III). The associations between total
and vigorous activity and risk of symptomatic
diverticular disease were stronger among
men under the age of 65 years (RR for total
physical activity=0.49, 95% CI 0.33, 0.74;
RR for vigorous activity=0.49, 95% CI 0-32,
0 77).
Using a multivariate model controlling for
age and energy adjusted total fat, we examined
the risk of symptomatic diverticular disease
among the subjects classified jointly according
to their intake of dietary fibre, and physical
activity. For men in the lowest quintile for both
dietary fibre and physical activity (compared
with those in the opposite extreme), the
relative risk of symptomatic diverticular
disease was 2.56, 95% CI 1.36, 4.82 (see
Figure). The association between a low level of
physical activity and the risk of symptomatic
diverticular disease was strongest among men
with low intake of fibre. However, the inter￾actions between total or vigorous activity and
dietary fibre were not statistically significant
when examined in a multivariate model that
also included age and energy adjusted total fat
(for interaction, p=0.33 with total physical
activity; p=0.38 with vigorous activity).
To evaluate the possibility that biased
detection of diverticular disease might have
occurred among individuals who had an
endoscopic procedure for routine screening or
for gastrointestinal conditions unrelated to
diverticular disease, we restricted our analysis
to the 3484 participants who reported that they
had colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy, or both,
between 1988 and 1992. Among these men,
the relationships between physical activity and
the risk of symptomatic diverticular disease,
were similar to those in the analysis including
all men. In this limited subset, we used the
same multiple logistic regression model with
age, energy adjusted dietary fibre, energy
adjusted total fat, and compared the effect of
high versus low levels of physical activity, using
the same cut points as in the analysis. For total
physical activity, the RR was 0.45 (95% CI
0.26, 0.78).
Discussion
These prospective data suggest that physical
activity, in general, and vigorous activity, in
particular, reduce the risk of symptomatic
diverticular disease. Risks were more notably
raised among men with both low dietary fibre
consumption and low physical activity. To
our knowledge, a prospective assessment of
physical activity has not been considered in
previous studies of diverticular disease.
Apart from reports of higher prevalence of
diverticular disease in urban settings, or among
sedentary occupations,35 the role of physical
activity and its association with diverticular
disease has not been explored in detail in
previous studies.
In our data, there was a weak positive
association between increasing BMI and the
risk of symptomatic diverticular disease. In a
recent study, more severe diverticular disease
was reported to occur in young (<40 years)
obese men.36 We could not address this
hypothesis, since the participants in our study
are all over the age of 40 years.
We observed a reduced risk of symptomatic
diverticular disease with increasing physical
activity level particularly vigorous activity.
Jogging and running were the only specific
activities that were individually statistically
significant after controlling for age, energy
adjusted dietary fibre, and energy adjusted
total fat. However, in these data, all the
vigorous activities had a trend toward reduced
risk, and it seems that the overall level of
vigorous physical activity is the dominant
factor and not any specific exercise.
A limited number of studies have addressed
the effect of physical activity on colonic
function, despite the widely held belief of a
beneficial effect of exercise on gastrointestinal
functions. A reduction in transit time was the
consistent finding in most of the studies that
addressed the effect of exercise on colonic
function,18 19 although some did not observe
such an effect.37 An increase in colonic motor
activity has been postulated; however, the
exact mechanism of this effect is still not clear.
Some authors have suggested that the effect
might be multifactorial, involving hormonal,
vascular, and mechanical aspects.18 Whether
physical activity influences diverticular disease
through any of these or other mechanisms, and
whether specific exercise (for example, jogging
and running) has specific effects on colonic
functions needs to be explored.
It has been argued that the abdominal pain
associated with diverticular disease is a result
of existing irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
Since both conditions are common, some
overlap between them might exist. How￾280

Prospective study ofphysical activity and the risk of symptomatic diverticular disease in men 281
ever, the prevailing understanding is that
diverticula can cause symptoms which vary
from a mild left quadrant pain to severe
abdominal pain,30 and in extreme cases
perforation and bleeding. Moreover. IBS has a
gradual onset as early as adolescence,38 com￾pared with the much later and shorter
presentation of symptomatic diverticular
disease. In addition, patients with IBS have a
much higher measure of anxiety and obses￾sion,39 which is not a common finding in
symptomatic diverticular disease. There are no
concrete and uniform criteria which define IBS,
and the only diagnostic criterion which is
accepted is the absence of an organic lesion,40
making IBS a diagnosis of exclusion, which is
not the case in symptomatic diverticular disease.
Since most cases of diverticular disease cases
are asymptomatic, and diagnosis is made when
affected individuals develop symptoms, we
explored the possibility that the associations
we observed were due to detection bias related
to the participants' level of physical activity.
We restricted the study population to subjects
who had had endoscopies within our follow
up period to eliminate the possibility of any
spurious associations due to any relationship
between physical activity and the rate of
endoscopy. Among the subpopulation of men
with recent endoscopies, our findings were not
appreciably different from those in the eligible
cohort; indeed, the association was even
slightly stronger, though this difference was
not statistically significant. We also examined
the possibility that the rate of endoscopies for
abdominal symptoms among our participants
(excluding symptomatic diverticular disease
cases), might be related to their level of
physical activity (for example, people who
are not physically active might have more
abdominal symptoms, and hence more
endoscopies). However, the opposite was
found, in that those participants who reported
having endoscopies for abdominal symptoms
(unrelated to diverticular disease) were in fact
exercising more and eating more fibre. We
therefore conclude that detection bias is
unlikely to have appreciably influenced our
results.
Because we relied mainly on self report
rather than obtaining complete medical
records for all the positive respondents, we
could not exclude right sided diverticulosis
from our cases. However, among the 108 cases
from whom we obtained medical records,
exclusively right sided diverticulosis was pre￾sent in less than 4%, which is what is expected
in a western population.29 This is in contrast
to the orient where diverticular disease is
predominantly right sided.41-43
Biased recall of physical activity was
unlikely, because the physical activity data
were collected before the diagnosis of sympto￾matic diverticular disease. We have controlled
for potential risk factors such as age, dietary
fibre, total fat, types and sources of fat,
smoking, alcohol, and socioeconomic status by
the nature of our population of male health
professionals. We recognise that some degree
of misclassification in physical activity is
inevitable. However, the prospective design of
this study means that any misclassifica￾tion would be random with regard to case
status, and hence would tend to attenuate any
association. Our findings are most directly
generalisable to US men 40 years and older.
Apart from reports of higher preponderance of
diverticular disease in women,2 we have no
reason to believe that the relations we observed
in men would be different.
Our findings suggest that increasing levels of
physical activity reduce the risk of sympto￾matic diverticular disease. They also provide
evidence that the combination of low physical
activity and a diet low in fibre particularly
augments the risk.
