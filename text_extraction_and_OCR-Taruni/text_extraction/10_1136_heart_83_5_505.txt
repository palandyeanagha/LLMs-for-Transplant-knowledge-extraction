Abstract
OBJECTIVE To describe the survival of a population based cohort
of patients with incident (new) heart failure and the clinical
features associated with mortality.
DESIGN A population based observational study.
SETTING Population of 151 000 served by 82 general practitioners
in west London.
PATIENTS New cases of heart failure were identified by daily
surveillance of acute hospital admissions to the local district general
hospital, and by general practitioner referral of all suspected new
cases of heart failure to a rapid access clinic.
INTERVENTIONS All patients with suspected heart failure
underwent clinical assessment, and chest radiography, ECG, and
echocardiogram were performed. A panel of three cardiologists
reviewed all the data and determined whether the definition of
heart failure had been met. Patients were subsequently managed by
the general practitioner in consultation with the local cardiologist
or admitting physician.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Death, overall and from
cardiovascular causes.
RESULTS There were 90 deaths (83 cardiovascular deaths) in the
cohort of 220 patients with incident heart failure over a median
follow up of 16 months. Survival was 81% at one month, 75% at
three months, 70% at six months, 62% at 12 months, and 57% at 18
months. Lower systolic blood pressure, higher serum creatinine
concentration, and greater extent of crackles on auscultation of the
lungs were independently predictive of cardiovascular mortality (all
p < 0.001).


CONCLUSIONS In patients with new heart failure, mortality is high
in the first few weeks after diagnosis. Simple clinical features can
identify a group of patients at especially high risk of death.
