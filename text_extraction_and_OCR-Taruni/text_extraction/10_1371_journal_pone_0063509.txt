Abstract
Background: Recently, Cipriani and colleagues examined the relative efficacy of 12 new-generation antidepressants on
major depression using network meta-analytic methods. They found that some of these medications outperformed others
in patient response to treatment. However, several methodological criticisms have been raised about network meta-analysis
and Cipriani’s analysis in particular which creates the concern that the stated superiority of some antidepressants relative to
others may be unwarranted.
Materials and Methods: A Monte Carlo simulation was conducted which involved replicating Cipriani’s network meta￾analysis under the null hypothesis (i.e., no true differences between antidepressants). The following simulation strategy was
implemented: (1) 1000 simulations were generated under the null hypothesis (i.e., under the assumption that there were no
differences among the 12 antidepressants), (2) each of the 1000 simulations were network meta-analyzed, and (3) the total
number of false positive results from the network meta-analyses were calculated.
Findings: Greater than 7 times out of 10, the network meta-analysis resulted in one or more comparisons that indicated the
superiority of at least one antidepressant when no such true differences among them existed.
Interpretation: Based on our simulation study, the results indicated that under identical conditions to those of the 117 RCTs
with 236 treatment arms contained in Cipriani et al.’s meta-analysis, one or more false claims about the relative efficacy of
antidepressants will be made over 70% of the time. As others have shown as well, there is little evidence in these trials that
any antidepressant is more effective than another. The tendency of network meta-analyses to generate false positive results
should be considered when conducting multiple comparison analyses.

Introduction
Recently, Cipriani and colleagues [1] examined the relative
efficacy of 12 new-generation antidepressants on major depression.
They applied a random-effects meta-analytic model that used a
Bayesian approach [2] (often referred to as network meta-analysis)
to examine 117 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and
concluded, ‘‘Mirtazapine, escitalopram, venlafaxine, and sertraline
were significantly more efficacious than duloxetine ([estimated]
odds ratios [OR] 1.39, 1.33, 1.30 and 1.27, respectively),
fluoxetine (1.37, 1.32, 1.28, and 1.25, respectively), fluvoxamine
(1.41, 1.35, 1.30, and 1.27, respectively), paroxetine (1.35, 1.30,
1.27, and 1.22, respectively), and reboxetine (2.03, 1.95, 1.89, and
1.85, respectively) [and that] reboxetine was significantly less
efficacious than all the other antidepressants tested’’ (pgs. 746). If
these results are reliable, this meta-analysis would have important
implications for clinical practice.
Determining the relative efficacy of competing treatments for a
particular disorder is of critical importance in evidence-based
medicine for improving the quality of care and reducing costs.
Cipriani et al.’s efforts to use a sophisticated method to determine
which antidepressants are more effective than others is commend￾able. Nevertheless, a number of concerns have been raised with
regard to network meta-analysis [3–6]. For example, Trinquart,
Abbe, and Ravaud [3] showed that reporting bias had a
particularly pernicious effect on the results of network meta￾analyses because the bias extended to treatments for which there
was no bias; in this way the reporting bias of a particular treatment
affected the ranking of all treatments, regardless of whether there
was bias for the other treatments. Further, in antidepressant
research, selective publication of results from placebo-controlled
trials has been well-documented [7]. Across the medical literature
in general, including head-to-head antidepressant trials, reporting
bias occurs frequently [8–11]. Indeed, the reported superiority of
escitalopram over citalopram reported in Cipriani et al. was
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 June 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 6 | e63509

partially driven by the exclusion of a head-to-head study in which
mean change on the two drugs was nearly identical yet in which
response rates were not reported, thus making it ineligible for
inclusion in their analysis (study MD-02) [11]. One critical letter to
the editor [10] suggested that ‘‘Meta-analysis of published plus
industry-furnished data could spuriously suggest that the best
drugs are those with the most shamelessly biased data.’’ (pgs.
1759–1760).
Another critical issue with regard to network meta-analysis is
that statistically significant differences detected among pairs of
treatments produced by this type of meta-analyses may have a
high probability of occurring by chance [5]. Recently, Wampold
and Serlin [5] examined two statistical models for testing the null
hypothesis that the true difference between any pair of treatments
from a set of treatments is zero (i.e., a null of no treatment
differences among a set of k treatments) and found that both
models appropriately protected error rates and were adequately
powered to detect alternative hypotheses for rather small effects
under various scenarios. When these methods were used to test the
null hypothesis that there were no differences among the 12
antidepressants using Cipriani et al.’s [1] data, Wampold and
Serlin found that there was insufficient evidence to reject the null
that any of the antidepressants was more effective than any other.
Given k = 12 antidepressants, there are k(k21)/2 = 66 pairwise
comparison and it appears that the observed differences among
the antidepressants may have occurred by chance and were not
due to systematic differences among the antidepressants, a result
that is consistent with other analyses of the same antidepressant
trials [12] but inconsistent with Cipriaini et al.’s conclusion. In
fact, the size of the effects produced by the RCTs were
considerably less that would be expected under the null hypothesis
of no differences [5].
The possibility that the statistically significant differences among
the antidepressants found by Cipriani et al. were spurious creates
the concern that the stated superiority of some antidepressants
relative to others is unwarranted. Indeed, a recent network meta￾analysis failed to replicate the results of Cipriani et al. [12]. This
may relate to Cipriani et al. only including comparative antide￾pressant trials in their analyses whereas Gartlehner et al. also
included placebo-controlled trials, or alternatively, the discrepancy
may be due to spurious findings.
The purpose of the present study was to conduct a Monte Carlo
study that mimicked the data from Cipriani et al. under the null of
no antidepressants differences to determine how likely it is produce
one or more spurious results.
Materials and Methods
A Monte Carlo simulation was conducted that involved
replicating Cipriani’s network meta-analysis under the null
hypothesis (i.e., no true differences between antidepressants). An
overview of the simulation strategy is as follows: (1) 1000
simulations were generated under the null hypothesis of no
differences among the 12 antidepressants, (2) each of the 1000
simulations were network meta-analyzed, (3) the total number of
false positive results from the network meta-analyses were
calculated.
One-thousand simulated datasets were generated that were
equivalent to Cipriani’s dataset in all aspects (viz., sample size,
antidepressants, and treatment comparisons). The response for
each participant in each study was randomly generated under a
null hypothesis of no differences in which the probability of a
positive response was equal to the response rate for the total
sample reported in Cipriani et al. The studies in Cipriani’s meta￾analysis included 25,928 participants, of whom 0.57 had a positive
response to treatment. Consequently, in each of the simulations,
the probability that an individual participant, regardless of arm in
the study, would have a positive response was set at 0.57 prior to
running the simulations. A 1 was assigned for a positive response,
and 0 otherwise, such that P(response = 1) = 0. 57. Then the
response of all participants in the 117 trials were randomly
repeated 1000 times under the null hypothesis that the probability
of a response was not conditioned on the antidepressant
administered.
The simulated data were then analyzed with network meta￾analysis using the ‘gemtc’ network meta-analysis package in the R
statistical software program [13]. Odds Ratios (OR) were
calculated from the resulting logistic point estimates, along with
the log odds of the standard errors. Before conducting the
simulation study, the software was validated by analyzing the
results of the 117 RCTs and we found that the results were in
accord with Cipriani et al. at a level of precision of 60.01. For
each of the 1000 simulations, the OR as well the standard error for
each of the k(k21)/2 = 66 comparisons between pairs of the k = 12
antidepressants were used to determine the statistical significance
of the pairwise comparisons: A false positive occurred when the
95% confidence interval for the OR did not include 1, indicating
that one antidepressant was considered to be superior to the
comparison.
Results
For each of the 1000 replications, let x be the number of false
positives (i.e., falsely concluding that antidepressant A was superior
to antidepressant B based on a = 0.05) obtained for that
replication. The values of x range from 0 (for that replication,
there were no statistically significant differences) to 66 (all pairwise
comparisons for the replication yielded statistical significance). A
frequency f(x) for each value of x was constructed to indicate the
number of replications that produced that value of x. The
probability distribution X was determined by computing f(x)/1000
for each value of x. That is, P(X = x) = f(x)/1000, which is the
probability of obtaining x number of significant comparisons. If
network meta-analysis maintains the proper family-wise error
rates, the probability of obtaining one or more false positives
would be less than 0.05 (i.e., P(X§1)v0:05). The probability
distribution of X is shown in Figure 1, truncated at X = 18. For
this distributionP(X§1)~0:72; thus, in more than 7 times out of
10, the network meta-analysis resulted in one or more comparisons
that indicated the superiority of at least one antidepressant when
no such true differences among them existed.
The expectation of the probability distribution of X was equal
to 2.68 (i.e, E(X)~S66
i~1xiP(xi)~2:68). On average, it is expected
that 2.68 significant differences will be detected by chance.
Interestingly, if the 66 comparisons were conducted independently
as a binomially distributed random variable with parameters
n = 66 comparisons and probability of false rejection of p = 0.05,
the expectation would be np = 3.30. Consequently, network meta￾analysis offers some protection, in that the expected number of
false positives was reduced from 3.30 to 2.68. However, the
relative reduction is not comforting as there remains a probability
of 0.72 of detecting one or more differences by chance.
Discussion
Based on the results of their network meta-analysis, Cipriani
et al. [1] concluded, ‘‘Our findings might help to choose among
new-generation antidepressants’’ (p. 753). Conclusions about the

relative efficacy of medical antidepressants should only be made if
the null hypothesis of no treatment differences is rejected,
conventionally based on an error rate of 0.05. Based on our
simulation study, the results indicated that under identical
conditions to those of the 117 RCTs with 236 treatment arms
contained in Cipriani et al.’s meta-analysis, one or more false
claims about efficacy will be made over 70% of the time. As others
[5], [6], [12] have shown, the pattern of results in the 117 RCTs
are consistent with the null hypothesis that the 12 antidepressants
are equally efficacious, so the findings of those analyses and our
simulation suggest that Cipriani et al.’s conclusions should not be
relied upon to make clinical decisions.
The results of the simulation study are specific to the parameters
of the RCTs in the Cipriani meta-analysis in terms of number of
trials, number of participants per trial, and response rate.
Consequently, network meta-analyses may perform differently
under different scenarios. However, it is clear that the use of
network meta-analysis to examine all k(k21)/2 pairwise compar￾isons of k treatments with conventional alpha levels is problematic.
The implications of conducting multiple statistical tests on the
family-wise error rates are well known [14].
If one is interested in the comparison of two particular
treatments, say Treatment A and Treatment B, and there are
insufficient number of trials comparing A and B, then the use of a
method that increases the power of the comparison by incorpo￾rating information from indirect paths, in the way that network
meta-analysis does, may be warranted. In that way, the method is
used to test a focused hypothesis with a powerful meta-analytic
strategy [15–17]. One of the advantages of Bayesian MTC
methods over conventional meta-analysis is that one can examine
and take into consideration the likelihood of the alternative
hypothesis (i.e., estimate the probability that a treatment should be
preferred). For example, conducting a rank probability test using
MTC methods will estimate the probability of each treatment to
be superior to other treatments (i.e., the probability of treatment A
ranking first, ranking 2nd, etc and the probability of treatment B
ranking first, and so on).
If one wanted to extend the method to compare one treatment,
say treatment A, to various other treatments, say B, C, and D, then
one could compare A to the effects of B, C, and D pooled,
although the details of how this would work in the context of
network meta-analysis has not yet been derived. In the antide￾pressant trials reviewed in Cipriani et al., reboxetine appears to be
inferior to other antidepressants, a result that has been meta￾analytically examined and confirmed [9]. If this is the conjecture
of interest, then the analysis should be focused on the relative
efficacy of reboxetine versus other antidepressants. Indeed, we
examined the 8 trials in Cipriani et al. that directly compared
reboxetine to one of the other 12 antidepressants and conducted a
standard meta-analysis. A restricted maximum likelihood univar￾Figure 1. Probability of Significant Contrasts from Simulation (66 Contrasts). The y-axis represents the probability of significant contrasts.

iate meta-analysis [18–20] of these 8 trials reveals that reboxetine
was inferior to the other antidepressants (OR = 0.81, [0.68, 0.98],
p = .03), suggesting in this case that utilizing the indirect paths was
not needed to reach this conclusion and emphasizing the
importance of using statistical power to focus on a particular
conjecture.
If one wishes to consider all pairwise comparisons, as Cipriani
et al. did, family-wise error rates must be considered. One way to
control the family-wise error rate would be to use a Bonferroni
correction for Type I error, although this is a fairly conservative
approach [21]. The Bonferroni correction involves altering the
alpha-level based on the total number of comparisons by dividing
the alpha by the number of comparisons. For example, in the
present case, 66 pairwise comparisons with an alpha of 0.05 yields
a Bonferroni correction of 0.05/66 = 0.0008 for each comparison,
although less conservative options might be available [21].
However, in the case of Cipriani et al., it is critical to keep in
mind that the omnibus test of the null hypothesis of no true
differences among any of the antidepressants was not rejected,
making the search for pairwise differences unwise [5].
The purpose of network meta-analysis is to identify which
antidepressants from a set of antidepressants are more effective
than others. We have shown in one case that caution must be used
when applying this method, as the probability of false positive is
unacceptably high. Such analyses do not address whether the set of
antidepressants is effective, evidence for which would be estab￾lished by conventional meta-analyses of the antidepressants versus
placebo controls.
Conclusion
The results of this simulation indicated that under identical
conditions to those of Cipriani et al.’s meta-analysis, one or more
false claims about efficacy will be made 71% of the time. As other
research has shown, the pattern of results in the 117 RCTs is
consistent with the null hypothesis that the 12 antidepressants are
equally efficacious. The findings of those analyses and our
simulation suggest that Cipriani et al.’s conclusions should not
be relied upon to make clinical decisions, although the inferiority
of reboxetine was confirmed by a meta-analysis of direct
comparisons.
