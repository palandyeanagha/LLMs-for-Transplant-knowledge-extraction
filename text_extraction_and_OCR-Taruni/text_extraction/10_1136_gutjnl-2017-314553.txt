Abstract
Background and aims Interruption of the 
enterohepatic circulation of bile acids (BAs) may protect 
against BA-mediated cholestatic liver and bile duct injury. 
BA sequestrants are established to treat cholestatic 
pruritus, but their impact on the underlying cholestasis is 
still unclear. We aimed to explore the therapeutic effects 
and mechanisms of the BA sequestrant colesevelam in a 
mouse model of sclerosing cholangitis.
Methods Mdr2−/− mice received colesevelam for 8 
weeks. Gene expression profiles of BA homeostasis, 
inflammation and fibrosis were explored in liver, 
intestine and colon. Hepatic and faecal BA profiles and 
gut microbiome were analysed. Glucagon-like peptide 
1 (GLP-1) levels in portal blood were measured by 
ELISA. Furthermore, Mdr2−/− mice as well as wild-type 
3,5-diethoxy-carbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine-fed mice were 
treated with GLP-1-receptor agonist exendin-4 for 2 
weeks prior to analysis.
Results Colesevelam reduced serum liver enzymes, BAs 
and expression of proinflammatory and profibrogenic 
markers. Faecal BA profiling revealed increased levels of 
secondary BAs after resin treatment, while hepatic and 
biliary BA composition showed a shift towards more 
hydrophilic BAs. Colonic GLP-1 secretion, portal venous 
GLP-1 levels and intestinal messenger RNA expression 
of gut hormone Proglucagon were increased, while 
ileal Fgf15 expression was abolished by colesevelam. 
Exendin-4 treatment increased bile duct mass without 
promoting a reactive cholangiocyte phenotype in mouse 
models of sclerosing cholangitis. Microbiota analysis 
showed an increase of the phylum δ-Proteobacteria 
after colesevelam treatment and a shift within the phyla 
Firmicutes from Clostridiales to Lactobacillus.
Conclusion Colesevelam increases faecal BA excretion 
and enhances BA conversion towards secondary 
BAs, thereby stimulating secretion of GLP-1 from 
enteroendocrine L-cells and attenuates liver and bile duct 
injury in Mdr2−/− mice.
Introduction
Bile acid (BA) sequestrants such as colesevelam 
are anion exchange resins that complex BAs in the 
intestinal lumen, thus decreasing BA reuptake and 
enterohepatic circulation. BA sequestrants have 
been primarily used for lowering serum cholesterol 
and treatment of cholestasis-associated pruritus1
 as 
well as BA-induced diarrhoea.2
 Interestingly, cole￾sevelam has been reported to improve serum BA 
levels3
 and colestyramine to improve cholestatic 
liver enzymes in patients with primary sclerosing 
Significance of this study 
What is already known on this subject?
► Bile acid (BA) sequestrants (resins) are used 
to treat cholestatic pruritus; in single cases, 
improvement of cholestasis was observed. 
► Resin-bound BAs stimulate the G-protein￾coupled BA receptor Takeda G protein-coupled 
receptor 5 (TGR5) which increases glucagon￾like peptide 1 (GLP-1) secretion. 
► GLP-1 signalling was shown to stimulate 
cholangiocyte proliferation and to protect bile 
duct epithelia against apoptosis. 
What are the new findings?
► Colesevelam treatment improved hepatic 
inflammation, fibrosis and ductular proliferation 
in the Mdr2−/− mouse model of sclerosing 
cholangitis.
► Colesevelam feeding reduced colonic farnesoid 
X receptor messenger RNA and protein 
expression in Mdr2−/− mice. 
► Colesevelam feeding result in detoxification 
of the hepatic as well as the biliary BA 
composition.
► Colesevelam feeding changed faecal BA profiles 
towards TGR5 signalling favouring increased 
colonic expression of GLP-1 and increasing its 
levels in portal blood, potentially contributing 
to the improvement of cholestatic liver injury in 
Mdr2−/− mice.
How might it impact on clinical practice in the 
foreseeable future?
► Beyond their current use in pruritus BA 
sequestrants (with a longstanding and excellent 
safety track record) may represent a cheap 
and readily available treatment strategy for 
underlying cholestatic liver injury.

cholangitis (PSC),4
 suggesting potential anticholestatic and bile 
duct-protective properties. Resins stimulate BA signalling via the 
Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (TGR5)5
 while repressing 
colonic farnesoid X receptor (FXR),6
 thereby promoting secre￾tion of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) from enteroendocrine 
L-cells.6
 Notably, the GLP-1 analogue exendin-4 has also cholan￾gioprotective effects in primary cholangiocytes as well as in bile 
duct ligated rats,7 8 in addition to its beneficial metabolic effects.9
Although both inhibitions of apical sodium-dependent bile salt 
transporter (ASBT) as well as administration of BA sequestrants 
result in interruption of enterohepatic circulation of BAs and 
improvement of cholestatic features,4 10 11 their mechanism of 
action may differ. In contrast to complex binding of BAs through 
resins, the recently developed inhibitors of ASBT enhance the 
excretion of unbound BAs into intestine, where they can signal 
intracellularly via FXR, thereby inhibiting GLP-1 expression/
secretion.6
 We hypothesise that BA resin treatment results in 
reduced liver and bile duct injury in the Mdr2−/− mouse (as a 
model of sclerosing cholangitis) by modulating faecal as well 
as biliary BA content and composition, favouring formation of 
endogenous BAs that stimulate TGR5, which in turn induces 
cholangioprotective GLP-1 production. 
Materials and methods
Animals
FVB/N wild-type (WT) and Mdr2−/− mice obtained from 
Jackson Laboratory (Bar Habor, Maine, USA) were housed in a 
12hours light/dark house facility with water and standard chow 
diet (SSNIFF, Soest, Germany) ad libitum.
Feeding protocols
Colesevelam (BA sequestrant) was a generous gift from Dr Alan 
F Hofmann. Eight weeks old male Mdr2−/− mice received either 
control diet or a diet supplemented with 2% (w/w) colesevelam 
for 8 weeks.
In another series, Mdr2−/− mice were injected once daily 
with exendin-4 (Sigma-Aldrich, Vienna, Austria) (0.1µg/kg) for 
2weeks. Eight-week-old male FVB/N WT mice receiving 0.1% 
3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine (DDC) for 17 days 
were injected with exendin-4 (0.1µg/kg) once daily. The exper￾imental protocols were approved by the local Animal Care and 
Use Committee (BMWFW-66.009/0315- WF/3b/2014).
Routine serum biochemistry and histology
Serum biochemistry and histological staining was performed as 
described previously.10
Immunohistochemistry
Detection of hepatic cytokeratin (CK) 19, F4/80, Ki67, vascular 
cell adhesion protein 1 (VCAM-1) and osteopontin (OPN) was 
performed as described previously.12 13 Immunohistochemistry 
(IHC) was also performed for GLP-1 in colon slices. In Mdr2−/−
mice, CK19, VCAM-1, OPN and GLP-1 IHC positive areas 
were quantified by ImageJ software V.1.47v (National Institute 
of Health). In WT DDC-fed mice, gene expression profiles were 
used for quantification of these markers since DDC feeding 
results in accumulation of protoporphyrin plaques in bile ducts 
that give false positive areas with computational quantification.

Results
Colesevelam treatment improves cholestatic liver injury in 
Mdr2−/− mice
Colesevelam was well tolerated in Mdr2−/− mice without affecting 
animal behaviour, food intake or body weight after 8 weeks 
of administration (see online supplementary figure 1). Impor￾tantly, mice did not develop diarrhoea. Colesevelam treatment 
even reduced the daily stool volume from 1.52g/mouse/day to 
1.03g/mouse/day (cumulative output). Liver histology revealed 
complete reversion of bile duct injury (pericholangitis and onion 
skin type of biliary fibrosis) in colesevelam-treated Mdr2−/− mice 
(figure 1A, all mice shown in online supplementary figure 3). 
Additional experimental series confirmed that colesevelam treat￾ment in Mdr2−/− mice led to complete reversion of the liver 
phenotype similar to that of WT mice (online supplementary 
figure 2). Accordingly, serum parameters ALT, AST and BAs as 
well as liver to body weight ratios of treated Mdr2−/− mice were 
in the same range as in WT mice (figure 1 and online supple￾mentary figure 2). Importantly, resin treatment reduced bile duct 
proliferation as determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) 
(figure 2A) and messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of CK 19 
(figure 2B). Together, these findings implicate a beneficial role of 
BA sequestrant feeding on cholestatic liver and bile duct injury in 
a mouse model of sclerosing cholangitis (figures 1 and 2).
Colesevelam treatment attenuates hepatic inflammation and 
fibrosis in Mdr2−/− mice
Because the reactive cholangiocyte phenotype in cholangiopa￾thies is associated with development of hepatic inflammation 
and fibrosis, markers for both key processes in the progression 
of liver injury were investigated (figures 3 and 4). Representative 
images of F4/80 IHC displayed reduced numbers of macrophages 
in livers of Mdr2−/− mice fed with colesevelam (figure 3A). 
Accordingly, F4/80 mRNA levels were reduced in the treatment 
group in comparison to Mdr2−/− control mice (figure 3B). Gene 
expression profiles of Mcp1 and Vcam-1 (two proinflammatory 
markers of liver injury in Mdr2−/− mice) also revealed profound 
reduction of these genes in colesevelam fed mice (figure 3B). 
Sirius red staining (figure 4A) displayed a marked reduction of 
fibrosis in Mdr2−/− mice subjected to colesevelam. Accordingly, 
transcription of profibrogenic genes such as Col1a1 and Col1a2
were considerably reduced in the treatment group (figure 4B). In 
line, hepatic hydroxyproline content as well as α-SMA protein 
levels were attenuated in the colesevelam fed Mdr2−/− mice 
(figure 4C and online supporting figure 4A).
Colesevelam feeding alters bile acid homeostasis in Mdr2−/−
mice
In line with effective BA depletion, colesevelam feeding reduced 
hepatic FXR protein expression (figure 5A) and increased mRNA 
expression of Cyp7a1 (the rate limiting enzyme in BA synthesis)

sevenfold in Mdr2−/− mice (figure 5B). Notably, the sinusoidal 
BA uptake machinery Na+/taurocholate cotransporting polypep￾tide was increased at protein level by colesevelam feeding while 
expression of the canalicular BA export pump bile salt export 
pump did not differ between the groups (see online supporting 
figure 4B). Ileal mRNA expression of Fxrα (figure 5C), its target 
hormone Fgf15 and Proglucagon was also assessed (figure 5D). 
Ileal Fxrα mRNA expression was reduced by colesevelam and 
in line, Fgf15 mRNA was completely abolished under resin 
treatment, while Proglucagon was induced fivefold (figure 5D), 
indicating that colesevelam feeding may have differential impact 
on FXR and TGR5-dependent regulation of gene expression. 
Notably, gene expression of the inflammatory marker Mcp1
was reduced in the terminal ileum of colesevelam fed Mdr2−/−
mice (figure 5D). Of particular interest, Proglucagon mRNA 
expression is also increased in the colon of colesevelam-treated 
Mdr2−/− mice (figure 5E).
Bile flow as well as biliary HCO3
-
 and BA output were not 
influenced by colesevelam feeding (figure 6A-C). Rather, hepatic 
and biliary BA concentrations increased, 8-fold and 1.4-fold 
(data not shown), respectively, while their profiles showed a shift 
towards a more hydrophilic BA composition with taurine-conju￾gated muricholic acids (MCAs) consisting 51% and 56%, respec￾tively (figure 6D and E).
Colesevelam treatment modifies faecal BA output and 
composition
Resin feeding profoundly increased faecal BA output (1276.8 
µmol/day in Mdr2−/− control mice and 6656.3 µmol/day in 
Mdr2−/− colesevelam-fed mice; cumulative faeces output). 
Importantly, in spite of a fivefold increase in faecal BA output 
Mdr2−/− mice subjected to colesevelam did not develop diar￾rhoea. At the same time, the resin significantly altered faecal 
BA composition by increasing concentrations of primary BAs α/
βMCA, cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid as well as 
of secondary BAs lithocholic acid (LCA) and deoxycholic acid 
(DCA) (table 1). Of note, the two most potent endogenous TGR5 
ligands, LCA and DCA,19 represented 51% of total BAs in the 
faeces of colesevelam fed Mdr2−/− mice, compared with 19% in 
the untreated group. Moreover, colesevelam-fed Mdr2−/− mice 
had 91% unconjugated BAs in the faeces compared with 83% in 
Mdr2−/− control mice (table 1).
Colesevelam treatment modifies gut microbiome
16srRNA microbiome analysis revealed an increase in the phylum 
Proteobacteria in Mdr2−/− mice treated with colesevelam (9% vs 
5% in the control group) (see online supplementary figure 5A). 
More specifically, this increase resulted from elevated abundance

of the class δ-Proteobacteria (order Desulfofibronales, family 
Desulfovibronacae) (see online supplementary figure 5B). 
Despite unchanged Firmicutes levels (Mdr2−/− control group 
38%; Mdr2−/− colesevelam group 36%), in the colesevelam fed 
group a shift within the phylum Firmicutes was seen, from the 
class Clostridiales to the class Bacilli, more specifically from the 
order Clostridiales to the order Lactobacillales, known to consist 
several species exerting bile salt hydrolase (BSH) activity, such as 
Lactobacillus20 (see online supplementary figure 5B). Also the 
phylum Bacteriodetes remained unchanged in Mdr2−/− control 
and colesevelam fed mice (56% vs 54%) (see online supplemen￾tary figure 5A). Of particular interest, although we see increased 
levels of secondary BAs in the faeces of colesevelam-fed Mdr2−/−
mice, the class Clostridia (containing bacteria exhibiting 7α
dehydroxylase activity) was predominant in untreated Mdr2−/−
control mice (see online supplementary figure 5B).
Colesevelam treatment increases colonic GLP-1 signalling in 
Mdr2−/− mice
Since increased mRNA levels of small intestinal and colonic 
Proglucagon and elevated secondary BAs LCA and DCA in 
colesevelam-fed Mdr2−/− mice point towards an augmented 
TGR5–GLP-1 signalling, colonic GLP-1 expression was assessed 
by IHC. Mdr2−/− mice fed with colesevelam exhibited increased 
numbers of GLP-1 secreting enteroendocrine L-cells (figure 7A). 
Accordingly, GLP-1 concentrations in portal blood of BA resin 
fed animals tended to be increased (figure 7B). Importantly 
(given the differential impact of FXR vs TGR5 on GLP-1 secre￾tion), mRNA (figure 7C) as well as protein expression levels 
of (proximal) colonic FXR were reduced in colesevelam-fed 
Mdr2−/− mice compared with controls (figure 7D). Also, the 
expression of the FXR downstream target Ibabp was reduced at 
mRNA level (data not shown).
GLP-1 receptor agonist exendin-4 promotes bile duct 
formation
To further address a potential role of GLP-1 in improvement of 
liver and biliary injury,7 8 we treated Mdr2−/− mice and WT mice 
fed with DDC13 (as mouse models of sclerosing cholangitis) with 
exendin-4 as GLP-1 receptor agonist.7
 In both models, exendin-4 
increased expression of CK19 and Ki67 (see online supplemen￾tary figures 6 and 8), while at the same time VCAM-1 and OPN 
remained unchanged (see online supplementary figures 7 and 9).

Discussion
In this study, we uncover that the BA binding resin cole￾sevelam reverses cholestatic liver and bile duct injury in the 
Mdr2−/− mouse model of sclerosing cholangitis (figure 1 and 
online supporting figures 2 and 3). Our findings provide strong 
evidence that resins such as colesevelam may have important 
implications as potential therapeutic strategies for cholestatic 
liver disease beyond their role in the treatment of pruritus. In 
this study, we now provide a potential mechanistic explanation 
for anecdotal clinical observations that resins may in addition 
to itch also improve cholestasis.1
 Importantly, these mechanisms 
appear to be different from more costly and side effect prone 
ASBT inhibitors that recently were propagated for the treatment 
of cholestatic pruritus.21 22
The improvement of the cholangiopathy in the Mdr2−/−
mouse subjected to colesevelam may at least in part be explained 
by interruption of the enterohepatic circulation with reduced 
output of potentially toxic BAs.10 11 Importantly, faecal BA 
analysis showed profound increases in BA excretion due to 
colesevelam treatment and enhanced conversion of primary to 
secondary BAs (table 1) with subsequent effects on BA signal￾ling in the gut. As such, we observed markedly increased GLP-1 
expression in enteroendocrine L-cells (figure 7A) and elevated 
GLP-1 levels in portal blood of colesevelam fed Mdr2−/−
mice (figure 7B), pointing towards increased TGR5 activity 
as a result of increased formation of secondary BAs. Notably, 
enteroendocrine L-cell FXR activity and TGR5-mediated GLP-1 
secretion appear to be inversely related.5 6 Mice lacking FXR 
showed elevated levels of Proglucagon mRNA and elevated 
serum GLP-1 levels.6
 Moreover, colesevelam treatment of ob/
ob mice was found to inhibit Fgf15 mRNA expression in ileum 
(further arguing for reduced FXR activity) and increased colonic 
Proglucagon expression.6
 In line, in our study small intestinal 
and colonic FXR mRNA and protein expression was reduced in 
Mdr2−/− mice subjected to colesevelam feeding while at the same 
time colonic GLP-1 expression and portal blood levels of this 
hormone were increased (figures 5 and 7).
GLP-1 released from the colon, entering the liver via portal 
blood, may bind to its receptor at cholangiocytes and modulate 
their adaptive response to cholestasis, by reducing cholangio￾cyte apoptosis while at the same time favouring their prolif￾eration, thereby preventing ductopaenia, a unifying event in 
cholangiopathies.7 8 23 This phenomenon would be predicted to 
protect cholangiocytes from BA-induced stress. GLP-1 docking 
to its receptor increases cAMP production, which results in an 
anti-inflammatory response due to the inhibition of NFκB and 
STAT1 expression, thereby reducing expression of inflammatory 
cytokines and chemokines as well as adhesion molecules such 
as Tnfα, Vcam-1 and Mcp1,
24 known to contribute the reactive 
cholangiocyte phenotype.25 This hypothesis is at least partially 
supported by our findings in Mdr2−/− mice as well as in DDC-fed 
WT mice which were injected with the GLP-1 receptor agonist

were increased due to exendin-4 injection while at the same time,

proliferation without promotion of a reactive cholangiocyte 
phenotype could be viewed as a potentially protective mecha￾nism counteracting ductopaenia.
In addition to increased GLP-1 signalling, also changes in 
hepatic and biliary BA composition due to colesevelam feeding 
may add to the overall beneficial effect seen in livers of resin￾treated Mdr2−/− mice. As such, colesevelam feeding led to a 
‘hydrophilisation’ (thereby detoxification) of hepatic as well as 
biliary BA composition with predominance of taurine-conju￾gated α-MCAs, β-MCAs and ω-MCAs (figure 6). Interestingly, 
this ‘hydrophilisation’ was not seen in Mdr2−/− mice treated with 
an ASBT inhibitor,10 as reflected by the negligible concentration 
of biliary hydrophilic muricholic acid species while concen￾tration of hydrophobic TDCA was increased.10 In addition to 
differences of GLP-1 signalling between ASBT inhibition and 
resin feeding, these divergent effects on biliary BA composi￾tion may significantly contribute to the mechanistic differences 
between these two treatment strategies.
The divergent effects on GLP-1 secretion might be explained 
by the fact that in ASBT inhibition, largely unmodified BAs enter 
the colon which can be reabsorbed and then activate intracellular 
FXR-dependent signalling pathways reported to suppress GLP-1 
expression.6
 Resin-bound BAs cannot be reabsorbed to the same 
extent and thus are still able to signal via the G protein-coupled 
receptor TGR5, thereby stimulating GLP-1 secretion. In line 
with this hypothesis, we found reduced colonic FXR expres￾sion in colesevelam-treated Mdr2−/− mice (figure 7C,D), which 
could contribute to increased GLP-1 expression,6

to stimulation via TGR5.26 Therefore, in the context of choles￾tatic liver disease, inhibiting FXR and stimulating TGR5 in the 
colon seems to have beneficial effects. Interestingly, colonic FXR 
expression remained unaffected in Mdr2−/− mice treated with 
the ASBT inhibitor A4250 (data not shown). Together, these 
observations suggest that changes in colonic BA signalling are 
specific for the BA resin therapy in Mdr2−/− mice and explained 
at least in part the more pronounced improvement of cholestatic 
liver injury in Mdr2−/− mice in comparison to reported effects of 
ileal ASBT inhibitors.10 11
Since BAs are potential regulators of microbiota, we performed 
a 16S rRNA analysis to determine microbiota composition. 
Although elevated concentrations of secondary BAs may impli￾cate a shift towards the phylum Firmicutes (since they include 
bacteria responsible for secondary BA production27), the abun￾dance of Firmicutes remained unchanged under colesevelam 
treatment (see online supplementary figure 5A) and the class 
Clostridia (which contains bacteria exhibiting 7α-dehydroxylase 
activity) was even predominant in the untreated Mdr2−/− control 
group (see online supplementary figure 5B). However, 7α-de￾hydroxylation is restricted to taurine-deamidated BAs. Indeed, 
primary BAs need to be deconjugated before transformation to 
secondary BAs.28 In line, Mdr2−/− mice fed with colesevelam 
have more unconjugated BAs in faeces than Mdr2−/− control 
mice (Mdr2−/− control mice 83% versus Mdr2−/− mice fed with 
colesevelam 91%). Interestingly, the family Lactobacillaceae, 
containing the genus Lactobacillus which is known to exert BSH 
activity20 was predominant in colesevelam-treated Mdr2−/− mice 
(see online supporting figure 5B). Furthermore, increased BA 
deconjugation may also explain the elevated amount of the class 
δ-Proteobacteria which consists of bacteria having desulfatation 
properties, since taurine contains a sulfonic moiety,20 which 
might represent a growth factor for these bacteria. In this context, 
δ-Proteobacteria produce hydrogen sulfide which was shown to 
have anti-inflammatory properties since it is relevant for the 
release of trefoil factor 3, which may play a key role in mucosal 
regeneration and repair processes,29 although this is discussed 
controversially.30 Another reason for increased concentration of 
faecal secondary BAs could be a prolonged transit time of resin￾bound BAs in the colon, which would provide the bacteria more 
time for metabolism of BAs.
Extending the use of BA sequestrants that have a long￾standing and excellent safety track record may represent a cheap 
and readily available approach in the treatment of cholestatic 
liver injury beyond pruritus. Cholestyramine has been shown 
to improve liver enzymes in PSC patients.4
 Furthermore, BA 
sequestrants are the first-line treatment for BA-induced diar￾rhoea,31 a side effect that was seen both in phase I and phase 
II clinical trials22 with ASBT inhibitors.21 While 'older resins' 
formulated as powders were poorly tolerated because of consid￾erably large doses and poor taste, the newer compounds can be 
formulated as pills or gels which may improve patients accep￾tance and compliance.
In conclusion, our study demonstrates that interruption 
of the enterohepatic circulation of BAs with colesevelam 
improves sclerosing cholangitis in the Mdr2−/− mouse by 
altering hepatic and biliary BA composition towards a more 
hydrophilic configuration. Moreover increasing faecal BA 
excretion and modulating the faecal BA composition towards 
more abundant TGR5 ligands results in increased colonic 
levels of GLP-1. Therefore, our results suggest that reduc￾tion of ileal BA reuptake by BA sequestrants may open new
