ABSTRACT
Aims: To assess the technical feasibility of a new mini-invasive sling procedure (MiniArc®) and present short-term results 
in the treatment of female urinary incontinence.
Materials and Methods: A total of 97 women with mixed or stress urinary incontinence (SUI) were treated by placement of 
the new single-incision sling. Pelvic organ prolapse was graded using the POP-Q system (pelvic organ prolapse quantification 
system). Preoperative workup included urodynamic evaluation, cough stress test and introital ultrasound. Postoperatively, 
introital ultrasound was performed to determine residual urine and check tape position. Quality of life was measured using 
King’s Health Questionnaire. A voiding diary and pad count served to verify the patients’ subjective complaints.
Results: The MiniArc® single-incision sling procedure was the initial intervention in 37 (38.2%) patients and the second 
intervention in 60 (61.7%) patients with recurrent incontinence. The cough stress test was negative in 79 (83.1%) women 
6 weeks after the sling procedure and in 74 (77.8%) at 12 months. De novo urge occurred in 32 (36.8%)women. Quality of 
life was significantly improved at 12-month follow-up in 65 (69.1%) patients (p < 0.001). The number of pads decreased 
significantly from 2.2 to 0.6 (p < 0.001) after the procedure. One patient developed an hematoma and bladder perforation 
occurred in another.
Conclusions: Our short-term clinical results suggest that the MiniArc® is a safe and effective minimally invasive sling 
procedure for treating female SUI. Randomized comparative controlled trials and long-term results are still required to define 
the role of the new sling system in comparison to established mid-urethral tape techniques for treating incontinence.

INTRODUCTION
As the population is aging, the medical com￾munity is increasingly challenged with the problem 
of urinary incontinence. More women (prevalence 
of 31% to 63%) are affected than men (1). Urinary 
incontinence can severely restrict patients in their 
daily activities and social life. The costs in terms of 
healthcare expenditure are a burden on the National 
Health System.

 Medical advances in the prevention, diag￾nosis, and treatment of urinary incontinence mean 
an improved quality of life for a large number of 
women.
 Open colposuspension and conventional tape 
procedures are considered the most effective interven￾tions for treating female stress urinary incontinence 
(SUI) to date. Good long-term results have been 
reported for both interventions (2). The TVT (ten￾sion-free vaginal tape) procedure is the most widely

used technique for tape placement worldwide. The 
operation was first described by Ulmsten et al. in 1996 
and aims at restoring continence by placement of a 
monofilament polypropylene mesh under the mid￾urethra (3). Various complications have been reported 
in association with the TVT procedure including 
bladder perforation, voiding dysfunction, retropubic 
hematoma, and injuries to structures of the true pelvis. 
A second generation of tapes has been applied using 
the transobturator approach, which was developed by 
Delorme (4) and De Leval (5). This approach avoids 
the retropubic space, thereby reducing the risk of 
inadvertent bladder and intestinal injury. Moreover, 
no adhesions are induced in the retropubic space, 
which could be important for the feasibility of future 
interventions. Transobturator tapes have since been 
established as the second tape procedure in addition 
to the TVT (6,7).
The new MiniArc® single-incision sling 
procedure is comparatively less invasive and is used 
to reduce complications such as bladder perforation, 
injury to structures in the true pelvis, and postopera￾tive pain in the region of the adductor muscles. The 
MiniArc® mini-sling is an approved medical device 
manufactured by American Medical Systems. Data on 
the outcome of the mini-sling procedure is still sparse. 
Tasinen et al. (8) have reported very poor results one 
year after surgery using a mini-invasive collagen sling 
to treat neurogenic urinary incontinence. Neuman 
has reported a failure rate of 7% in a study of 100 
women who underwent TVT-SECUR insertion (9) in 
13 hospitals. Transobturator tapes have since become 
established and are not inferior to the TVT (10).
 The aim of our study was to assess the techni￾cal feasibility of a new mini-invasive sling procedure 
(MiniArc®) and present short-term results in the 
treatment of female urinary incontinence.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
 We studied 97 women with mixed or stress 
urinary incontinence based on reported subjective 
complaints (voiding diary, pad count) and objective 
workup by means of urodynamic evaluation as well 
as physical and imaging examination, that included: a) 
tonometry - premature urge at less than 200 mL blad￾der filling, b) bladder capacity - reduced to less than 
350 mL, c) compliance - reduced at a bladder pressure 
increase of over 2.6 cm H2
0 per 100 mL bladder filling 
(11), d) profile at rest - low-pressure urethra defined 
as urethral pressure < 10 cm H2
0, e) profile during 
straining, f) cough stress test, g) pelvic examination, 
POP-Q (pelvic organ prolapse quantification system) 
(10), and h) introital ultrasound (12,13). The patients 
were operated on between January 2007 and July 
2008. The women with pure stress urinary inconti￾nence had undergone prior conservative treatment 
with biofeedback, electrostimulation, and duloxetine 
hydrochloride between January 2007 and July 2008 
(Tables-1 and 2).
 Of the 97 patients, 79 (81.4%) had pure 
SUI, 18 (18.6%) mixed urinary incontinence. All pa￾tients with mixed incontinence had sensory urgency 
(premature first urge without detrusor contraction). 
Urodynamically proven urethral insufficiency and a 
positive cough stress test were present in all cases. 
Tonometry findings were unremarkable in all patients 
without sensory urge.
 Four (4.2%) women had a cystocele (AaBa > 
+1) based on the POP-Q system, but, based on their 
symptoms, only required sling insertion.
 Since it was our intention not to select patients 
as regards constitution, prior surgery, concomitant 
disease, and urodynamic findings, a retrospective 
design appeared to be the most suitable approach.
 The MiniArc® sling investigated in our 
study was 8 cm in length and has self-fixating tips 
for anchorage in the obturator internus muscle and 
membrane (Figures-1 and 2).

Mini-Invasive Sling in The Treatment of Urinary Incontinence
 All patients were comprehensively informed 
about the new procedure by the same person. The 
transobturator tape was offered as an alternative ap￾proach, and it was emphasized that long-term expe￾rience with the MiniArc® is still lacking. Drawings 
were presented to the patients to illustrate the two 
approaches. Patients were not influenced and could 
freely select the method they preferred.
 All patients were operated on at the German 
Pelvic Floor Center in Berlin. Two experienced op￾erators performed all sling procedures included in the 
analysis. Each of them had previously performed the 
new procedure in 10 patients not included in the study 
to become familiar with the technique. The women 
included in the study underwent isolated minimally 
invasive sling insertion without additional prolapse re￾pair in order to exclude other factors that might impact 
the outcome. Patients with mixed urinary incontinence 
were initially treated for the urge component using 
electrostimulation and/or anticholinergic medication 
(Table-3).
 All surgical interventions were performed 
in the lithotomy position under general anesthesia

orifice. Next, the paraurethral tissue was dissected 
with scissors, creating a tunnel up to the inferior ramus 
of the pubic bone. The sling was then advanced into 
the obturator internus muscle and obturator membrane 
below the inferior pubic ramus with a needle. Tension￾free positioning of the sling was ensured by inserting 
a forceps handle between the tape and the urethra. 
The insertion angle was 45 degrees in the direction 
of the adductor longus muscle tendon (Figure-3). The 
vaginal incision was closed with vicryl sutures.
 Upon completion of the procedure, the cath￾eter was removed and the patient had to void sponta￾neously within the next four hours. The hospital stay 
was two days. Postoperative evaluation comprised 
of the patients’ subjective assessment (voiding di￾ary, pad count) and quality of life questionnaire. The 
clinical evaluation included a pelvic examination, a

cough stress test, and introital ultrasound to measure 
the postvoid residual urine volume and determine the 
sling position.
 Follow-up examinations were performed 
directly postoperatively as well as 6 weeks and 12 
months after tape insertion.
 Therapeutic failure was defined as persistent 
SUI that impaired the patient’s quality of life and was 
confirmed by the clinical findings.
 A pad count and a voiding diary served to 
objectively ascertain restored continence.
RESULTS
 Thirty-seven (38.2%) patients underwent the 
MiniArc® procedure as a primary intervention, 60 
(61.7%) for recurrent urinary incontinence. Outcome 
differed between these two groups (Table-4).
 A low-pressure urethra was diagnosed in 23 
patients (24.2%) and was found to significantly (p 
< 0.001) correlate with outcome. Thirteen of the 23 
patients (56.5%) in this subgroup were therapeutic 
failures with persistent SUI.
 The intra- and postoperative complications in 
the study population are summarized in (Table-5).
 Postoperative voiding dysfunction was de￾fined as a residual urine volume greater than 100 mL 
and was treated by alpha-blocker administration and 
catheterization.
 Patients who developed bladder infection 
received cephalosporin for one week.
 De novo urge symptoms were treated by an￾ticholinergic medication in 20 (20.6%) patients and 
by physical therapy in 12 (12.4%).
 The preoperative urge component present in 
18 (18.6%) patients persisted after conservative treat￾ment and the sling procedure in five (27.8%) cases.
 The cough test was negative in 79 (83.1%) 
women at 6-week follow-up and in 74 (77.8%) women 
at 12-month follow-up. The test was positive in 16 
(16.8%) women at 6 weeks and in 20 (21.3%) women 
at 12 months.
 At 12-month follow-up, 77.8% (n = 66) of the 
women reported to be continent while 21.3% (n = 20) 
reported persistent urine loss during physical activ￾ity. These results were also reflected in self-reported 
quality of life questionnaires.
 Significant improvement in quality of life was 
observed for 66 (68.0%) patients at 6-week follow￾up (p < 0.001) while 22 (22.7%) had an unchanged 
quality of life, and 9 (9.4%) reported deterioration 
compared with their situation before the intervention. 
At 12-month follow-up, there was persistent improve￾ment for 65 (69, 10%) patients (p < 0.001), unchanged 
quality of life for 17 (17.5%), and deterioration for 15 
(15.5%) women. The number of pads used decreased 
significantly from 2.2 before to 0.6 (p < 0.001) after 
the sling procedure.
 The patients who reported deterioration after 
the intervention used more pads than preoperatively, 
had greater involuntary urine loss (based on the

dure can also be performed with local anesthesia and 
analgesia. Further advantages over the transobturator 
tape are that there is no risk of obturator nerve damage 
or adductor muscle pain. Postprocedural symptoms 
of overactive bladder are most likely attributable to 
the anchorage of the tape. In contrast to TVTs, the 
self-fixating tip of the MiniArc® sling does not al￾low much correction after placement. This is why the 
MiniArc® sling should be placed at a distance of 0.5 
cm from the mid-urethra (i.e. the distance between the 
tape and the urethra) without further intraoperative 
tensioning after placement.
 The high rate of de novo urge is probably 
due to the mode of anchorage of the new tape, which 
has self-fixating tips. As a result, tension-free tissue 
integration is a challenge and depends on numerous 
factors such as tissue properties, insertion technique, 
tape position and retraction. Despite the standardized 
technique used in our study, it was not possible to 
eliminate de novo urge.
 In the patients included in our study, de novo 
urge was treated with a combination of anticholinergic 
medication and physical therapy. Our findings do not 
allow any final conclusions to be drawn as to whether 
the rather high rate of de novo urge might be lowered 
by changing the insertion technique. The cure rates of 
83.1.0% after six weeks and 77.8% after 12 months 
are good but not comparable to the rates achieved 
with established tape procedures. The poorer outcome 
may be attributable to the large proportion of patients 
with recurrent incontinence in our population and the 
inclusion of 13 (13.6%) patients with low-pressure 
urethra. Recurrent incontinence is likely attributable 
to scar formation or even rigid tissue integration of 
the tape, suggesting that the tape does not provide 
adequate dynamic support of the urethra. Another 
possible contributing factor is neurogenic damage. 
Established tape procedures are also known to have 
poorer results in patients with a low-pressure urethra 
(17-20), Outcome was poorer in women with prior 
incontinence surgery compared with the women who 
underwent the MiniArc® procedure as a primary in￾tervention. We did not include a control group because 
we wanted each patient to have a choice to opt for any 
of the conventional treatments after comprehensive 
information about the new sling procedure. This is 
also why we chose a retrospective design.
voiding diary entries), and developed de novo urge 
(voiding frequency > 10/day).
 Ultrasound was performed to evaluate the 
postoperative tape position. The tape was in the area 
of the mid-urethra in 82 (84.5%) women, under the 
distal urethra in 9 (9.3%) women, and close to the 
bladder neck in 6 patients (6.2%). There was no corre￾lation between tape position and de novo urge. There 
was also no correlation between the tape position at 
ultrasound and subjectively reported deterioration 
of incontinence after surgery. The mean length of 
surgery was 6 ± 3.5 minutes and the mean blood loss 
was 10 ± 25 mL.
DISCUSSION
 The results we achieved with the MiniArc® 
sling system in treating female urinary incontinence 
are representative of the short-term outcome of this 
new minimally invasive sling procedure. The long￾term success rates (5-10 years) reported in the litera￾ture are 78 % (14) to 90% (14) for colposuspension 
and 81% for the TVT (15). The outcome reported for 
transobturator tapes is comparable to that of the TVT 
procedure (16). A new method should be similar or 
superior to established therapies and/or be safer and 
technically easier to handle.
 We encountered only one intraoperative 
hemorrhage, which did not require blood transfusion, 
and one bladder perforation, which was most likely 
due to scar formation as this patient had already un￾dergone multiple prior operations. On the whole, the 
new sling was easy to insert and the duration of the 
procedure was very short compared to existing tech￾niques. When the procedure is properly performed, 
the risk of injury to the bladder, intestine, or urethra 
is negligible. Since the needle is very thin and can 
be inserted at different angles, proper advancement 
requires strict adherence to anatomic structures, 
which is why physicians require a training course 
before performing the procedure in patients. As with 
transobturator tapes, the retropubic space is avoided, 
which is an advantage if patients need future surgery. 
Since all interventions were performed in the setting 
of a workshop, we opted for standardized anesthesia 
with a laryngeal mask. The MiniArc® sling proce-

340
Mini-Invasive Sling in The Treatment of Urinary Incontinence
 The MiniArc® sling can be placed with 
minimal tissue injury and is easy to use. However, the 
instrument design leaves the surgeon with little control 
over tape positioning and injury cannot be excluded. 
Our preliminary experience suggests that the new tape 
appears to be associated with fewer complications 
in terms of organ damage and bleeding compared 
with established tape procedures for treating urinary 
incontinence.
 The indications for MiniArc® insertion will 
be defined by its minimal invasiveness and the lower 
complication rates.
 Further studies are needed to determine 
whether the new tape is beneficial in women with re￾current urinary incontinence or a low-pressure urethra. 
Future studies must also elucidate the causes of the 
high rate of de novo urge. Prospective randomized 
comparative controlled trials and long-term follow￾up are needed to define the relative place of the new 
sling system in comparison with other mid-urethral 
tape techniques used for anti-incontinence surgery.
 The patients who reported deterioration after 
the intervention used more pads than preoperatively, 
had greater involuntary urine loss (based on the 
voiding diary entries), and developed de novo urge 
(voiding frequency > 10/day).
 Thirty-seven (38.2%) patients underwent the 
MiniArc® procedure as a primary intervention, 60 
(61.7%) for recurrent urinary incontinence. Neverthe￾less, there were differences in outcome between these 
two groups.

EDITORIAL COMMENT
The evolution of anti-incontinence surgery 
has evolved from the retro-pubic colposuspension to 
the retro-pubic TVT, then to the trans-obturator TVT 
and now, possibly, to the mini sub urethral slings. The 
background rationale for these changes is the desire to 
maintain and further improve the therapeutic results, 
while reducing the operative related complications. 
Given that the current operations for the treatment 
of female urinary stress incontinence are far from 
being perfect in terms of cure and related complica￾tions, and that the industry is moving faster than the 
clinical trials, one is required to make personal deci￾sions regarding the exact procedure for their patients 
with no sufficient data to rely on. Thus, one should

misleading to believe that they the mini-sling is a very

crucial as well, and this might be achieved by doing

EDITORIAL COMMENT
The introduction of the intravaginal sling 
(IVS) in 1996 has revolutionized the surgical treat￾ment for female stress urinary incontinence (SUI) (1). 
Subsequent the minimal invasive suburethral slings 
replaced the colposuspension as surgical gold stan￾dard for SUI (2). In recent years, various slings with 
minor and major modifications have been introduced. 
The first major modification was the transobturator 
slings with reduced rates of bladder perforation (3,4). 
Lately the mini-slings followed. However, do we need 
this further modification to the existing and what is 
possible to improve?
 With the mini-slings, external incisions can 
be eliminated, only a single vaginal incision is neces￾sary. The mesh became shorter and no mesh lateral 
to the obturator is needed. Thus, the tissue trauma 
can be reduced and maybe also postoperative pain. 
The procedure time can possibly be shorten and 
less anesthesia are necessary. It is postulated, that 
the minis-lings are more minimal invasive than the 
retropubic and transobturatoric slings.
 However, for a new surgical treatment of a 
non-life-threatening disease like SIU, the most impor￾tant issue is to show better results, lower complication 
rates and a higher postoperative quality of life and 
patients´ satisfaction as the established treatment 
options.
 The first mini-sling, the TVT-secure, showed 
a steep learning curve but with some implant chal￾lenges and a high variability in efficacy (5,6).
 In the article of Gauruder-Burmester and 
Popken results after the implantation of the newest 
mini-sling, the MiniArc, with a follow-up until 12 
months postoperatively were published. The new 
sling seems to be very safe, but the cure rate is not 
better than the established gold standard. In addition, 
the authors report a high rate of de-novo-urgency. 
However, its cause remains unclear.
 In total, the results look promising, but we 
need more data especially long-time data for a final as￾sessment. Thus, prospective comparative randomized 
controlled trials with a long follow-up and evaluation 
of the quality-of-life and of the postoperative pain are 
necessary to determine its true efficacy.
