Portal vein interventions in liver transplant recipients
represent a group of interventions in the management of
several disease entities, including portal vein stenosis, portal
vein thrombosis, and recurrent liver cirrhosis with portal
hypertension with and without gastric varices. The proce￾dures performed in these patient populations include portal
vein angioplasty with or without stent placement for portal
vein stenosis, portal vein thrombolysis with or without stent
placement for portal vein thrombosis, transjugular intra￾hepatic portosystemic shunts (TIPS) or splenic embolization
for cirrhosis, and balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous
obliteration (BRTO) for gastric varices. This article
discusses these disease entities and the minimal invasive
procedures used in their management.
Portal Venous Stenosis
Incidence and Presentation
Overall, portal venous stenosis (PVS) is uncommon and occurs
in 5% of all liver transplants.1–4 However, PVS occurs more
commonly in transplants using split grafts (4% in adult split
grafts and 7 to 27% in pediatric split grafts).5–8 PVS is rare
(<1 to 2%) in adult whole liver grafts.7,9 In a study by Khalaf,
whole grafts versus living related split grafts had a PVS rate of
0% versus 4.3%, respectively.9 As a result, most of the PVS cases
in the literature have been reported in pediatric liver trans￾plant recipients.5,6,10–14 PVS almost always occurs at the
surgical anastomosis,15 and its distance from the portal
bifurcation depends on the length of the graft portal vein
stump (distance between the surgical anastomosis and the
graft portal bifurcation).15 If there is a negligible length to the
graft stump, then the stenosis occurs right at the portal vein
bifurcation/trifurcation (►Fig. 1).

Split grafts (particularly pediatric left lobe split grafts)
have a higher risk of developing portal venous stenoses
because the recipient portal vein usually has a small diame￾ter; this is technically challenging and usually requires surgi￾cal plication of the relatively larger donor portal vein,
predisposing to anastomotic stenoses.3,7,13 Furthermore, in
living donor split hepatic grafts, the portal vein anastomosis is
technically challenging because the donor portal vein seg￾ment(s) is relatively short and not infrequently requires
interposition grafts or multiple/complex anastomotic recon￾structions.5,16 Other known risk factors for developing PVS
after transplantation are prior splenectomy (increases risk
fivefold) and the Mayo management protocol for
cholangiocarcinoma.4,7,17
Early portal venous stenoses (occurring within 6 months
after transplantation) are probably due to technical rea￾sons.15 Most portal venous stenoses, however, occur late
(after 6 months).11,12,15,18,19 In three studies evaluating the
diagnosis of PVS in adult whole grafts (total of eight patients),
the average time lapse between the liver transplant and
portal vein stenosis was over a year (range: 1 to
31 months).7,20 Such delayed PVS is due to scarring/fibrosis
with neointimal hyperplasia.7
Posttransplant portal vein stenoses have a variable pre￾sentation. Severe PVS can lead to portal vein thrombosis,
although it can also be asymptomatic with or without abnor￾mal liver function tests. It can also present with uncompen￾sated portal hypertension symptoms (ascites, variceal
bleeding) and/or lower limb edema with hepatic graft failure
(clinical hepatic failure).7,8,11,12,18,19,21 In three studies eval￾uating adult whole grafts with portal vein stenoses (total of
24 patients), 10 patients (42%) had ascites, 8 patients (33%)
had variceal bleeding, and 6 patients (25%) were asymptom￾atic with abnormal laboratory liver function tests only.7,20–22
Imaging Diagnosis
Significant posttransplant PVS is difficult to evaluate by cross￾sectional studies such as computed tomography (CT) and
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Both of these are not
typically dynamic imaging modalities.15 It is particularly
difficult to assess the portal anastomosis accurately when
there is an angulation and/or a size mismatch between the
diameter of the native and donor portal veins.23 For this
reason, because Doppler ultrasound offers a hemodynamic
assessment, it may be the most accurate noninvasive modali￾ty for evaluating and diagnosing PVS.15 Doppler ultrasound
findings suggestive of a significant PVS include peak portal
velocities that are three- to fourfold higher at the anastomo￾sis, a focal increase of portal velocity greater than threefold,
and a peak velocity >125 cm/second.23–25 These Doppler
findings have a sensitivity and a specificity for PVS of 73%
and 95 to 100%, respectively.23–25
Transcatheter portography remains the most accurate and
gold standard examination because of its ability to directly

performed.

visualize the anastomosis as well as to perform portal pres￾sure gradient measurements across the anastomosis.23,24,26
However, the gradient that signifies a significant anastomotic
stenosis is unknown, is controversial, and there are no stand￾ards reported.5,7,15 Most operators use a gradient >4 to 5 mm
Hg as an indication for a significant PVS, although some use
3 mm Hg or 8 mm Hg gradients as a threshold.5,27 In my
opinion,15 there are several reasons for these discrepant
reports. First, the case numbers are small and there are
numerous variables with liver transplantation. This is com￾plicated by the fact that normalization of the graft dysfunc￾tion after treatment may not occur quickly and may be
coincidental, if it occurs at all. Second, it is difficult to make
a threshold gradient cutoff of a relative measurement, partic￾ularly when there can be considerable variations in the portal
pressure that affect the measurements. Third, there maybe
portosystemic collaterals (including splenorenal or gastro￾renal shunts; see later) that decompress the portal circulation
of the recipient distal to the anastomosis, and as a result they
reduce the portal pressure gradient across the portal anasto￾mosis. Fourth, there is shunting of blood from the hepatic
artery to the portal vein, mediated by the hepatic artery
buffer response, when there is reduction of flow in the portal
vein (due to the stenosis). This may alter pressures and may
even redirect normal portal blood flow from hepatopetal to
hepatofugal (see article in this issue on nonocclusive hepatic
artery hypoperfusion syndrome).15
Management
Traditionally, the management of portal vein stenoses was
surgical, either by primary repair after resecting the adhesed
and scarred anastomosis or by retransplantation.7,28 Howev￾er, in 1990 Olcott and coworkers reported the first docu￾mented posttransplant PVS balloon dilation.7,29 From then
on, there has been a paradigm shift in which surgery has been
largely replaced by catheter-directed endovascular proce￾dures, due to the latter's less invasive nature and reduced
periprocedural morbidity.7
The percutaneous transhepatic approach is preferred over
the TIPS approach for portal vein access.7,15,23 The TIPS
approach has been described elsewhere.7,30–32 However,
this approach takes longer, is more cumbersome, and does
not give enough “running room” to the portal anastomoses
because the TIPS portal access site is usually close to the
PVS.15 Moreover, the TIPS approach is almost always mala￾ligned with the long axis of the portal vein, making trans￾catheter manipulations more difficult.15 Alternatively, most
portal veins are easily accessed under ultrasound and/or
fluoroscopy via a percutaneous transhepatic approach, which
is directly in line with the long axis of the portal vein as well as
a more appropriate distance from the puncture to the anas￾tomosis.15 The direct tract through the liver provides the best
mechanical advantage for negotiating severe stenoses.11,23
The right percutaneous intercostal approach is more com￾mon than a left-sided subxiphoid approach in whole grafts.
However, the right intercostal approach likely has a higher
risk of bleeding and pleural injury compared with the left
portal approach.15 Intravenous heparin may be given to help
reduce the risk of thrombosis during the angioplasty, and
postangioplasty anticoagulation is given for 24 to 72 hours
after the procedure. Long-term postangioplasty anticoagula￾tion is typically unnecessary.11 If placement of a stent be￾comes necessary, self-expanding bare stents are usually
used.11
Funaki and coworkers found that a third of 30 patients
undergoing percutaneous intervention had intraprocedural
recoil immediately after angioplasty, requiring immediate
stent placement. Of the remaining two-thirds of patients
with adequate response to balloon angioplasty, half (one
third of the overall population) restenosed 1 to 31 months
(mean: 6 months) after the initial angioplasty.11 Failures of
angioplasty (intraprocedural or delayed restenoses) were
treated with stent placement with good long-term results.11
Two complications (7%), both portal vein thromboses, oc￾curred in their experience;11,23 however, both patients re￾sponded favorably to transcatheter thrombolysis.11,23 When
considering the long-term success of a single balloon dilation
without stent placement, the results are variable with a long￾term patency/success of 36 to 71% at 2 to 3 years.6,11 When
distinguishing pediatric split grafts and adult whole liver
grafts, the reported restenosis rates following balloon angio￾plasty alone are 29 to 37% versus 20%, respectively.7,20,33
From a conservative standpoint, stents are usually consid￾ered only for intraprocedural recoil and early restenosis
(within 6 months) after a technically successful angioplasty.15
This is because stents may impede future surgeries (retrans￾plantation) and, in the pediatric recipient population, may
cause focal narrowing at the stent edge due to graft and
recipient growth (stents do not grow with the patient and
graft, and thus they may form a relative narrowing).5,8 The
patency results of stents in portal veins is scant. Most stents
are self-expanding, and the patency is reported to be as high
as 100% over 3 to 5 years.11,33 Complications from portal vein
angioplasty or stent placement include portal vein thrombo￾sis, hemoperitoneum, and hemothorax.7,11,23,33
Portal Vein Thrombosis
Incidence and Presentation
Portal venous thrombosis (PVT) is an uncommon complica￾tion, occurring in 1 to 4% of transplants.6,9,11,34 PVT can be
classified as early (within a month after transplant) or late
(more than a month after transplant) (PVS2). Most PVTs occur
within a month after from the transplant.11,23,34,35 It is likely
that >80% of PVT cases are diagnosed within a month (early
PVT) from the transplant.9 Early PVT is more likely to cause
graft loss than late PVT.9 Hypothetically, the causes of early
PVT include suboptimal grafts, hypercoagulable states, portal
venous stasis, and possibly underlying anatomical defects
such as a PVS or kinks. Late PVT may actually be early PVT that
was overlooked or thrombosis due to portal vein stenosis and/
or kinks. PVT has been described as iatrogenic from intra￾procedural angioplasty11 or secondary to previously placed
stents for PVS.14
Similar to severe PVS, PVT may present with signs of portal
hypertension. If asymptomatic, nonspecific liver function test

abnormalities may be encountered.18,23,35 Early PVT has a
poor prognosis, with up to 100% of cases leading to graft loss.9
Overall, PVT leads to a reduction in 5-year graft survival when
compared with liver transplant recipients without portal vein
complications.16
Imaging Diagnosis
Doppler ultrasound may demonstrate lack of flow, or echo￾genic thrombus may be seen.23,36 Power Doppler should be
used to increase the sensitivity of Doppler because conven￾tional Doppler ultrasound may mistakenly perceive very slow
flow in the portal vein as PVT. Acute thrombus may cause an
increase in the diameter of the portal vein, which can also be
observed on Doppler ultrasound, CT, or MRI.
Management
Unlike PVS, where percutaneous transhepatic access is most
commonly used, the portal venous approach for PVT varies
from one operator/institution to another and can vary from
one circumstance to the other.15 The advantages of the TIPS
approach is that it may reduce the risk of intraperitoneal
bleeding.15 In addition, establishing a TIPS shunt can provide
outflow to the portal vein, especially if the intrahepatic portal
branches are thrombosed with a clot that is recalcitrant to
fibrinolysis.15 Furthermore, a TIPS provides a larger caliber
access that allows larger platforms to be introduced to the
portal vein. As a result, percutaneous thrombectomy can be
performed through the TIPS from a transjugular approach by
pulling a Fogarty catheter from the portal vein and into the
inferior vena cava.15 The disadvantages of a TIPS approach is
that a TIPS is a more involved procedure that takes longer, has
more complications, may need anesthesia, and provides little
“running room” to the portal vein anastomosis in case a stent
needs to be placed.15
The advantages of the percutaneous transhepatic ap￾proach were discussed earlier. The disadvantage of this
approach is that it may have an increased bleeding risk
with the use of thrombolytics/fibrinolytics.15 Various combi￾nations of mechanical and pharmaceutical thrombolytic de￾vices, drugs, and techniques can be utilized. Adjunct stent
deployment has been used to minimize, if not avoid, phar￾maceutical fibrinolysis and thus reduce the length of the
procedure and the risk of bleeding.37 The additional advan￾tage of stent placement in the setting of PVT is that it
addresses underlying portal venous stenosis, if any is to be
found.11,37
The experience in transcatheter management of PVT in
liver transplant recipients is very scant in the
literature.6,11,18,29,34–39 As a result, definitive conclusions
cannot be drawn regarding complications, technical suc￾cesses, and longevity of successful procedures. Transcatheter
management is most likely applicable to late symptomatic
PVT. The technical success is probably 55 to 70% and the
mid- to long-term patency is probably on the order of 50 to
60%.6,35 Iatrogenic PVT following balloon angioplasty for
portal vein stenosis is very successful when performed within
the same session. It can typically be performed without the
use of infusion catheter thrombolysis because the clot is fresh
and the underlying PVS has already been identified and
treated.11,15
Recurrent Portal Hypertension or
Consequences of Pretransplant Portal
Hypertension
Recurrent portal hypertension after liver transplantation is
commonly due to recurrent hepatitis C, late graft failure
(primary unexplained hepatic graft failure with cirrhosis),
and possibly poor grafts in the first place.40–42 However, one
must understand that the presence of portosystemic collat￾erals after transplantation, gastric varices with their gastro￾renal shunts included, is not necessarily evidence of
posttransplant portal hypertension recurrence but may in￾stead be a product of pretransplant portal hypertension. In
this setting, one possibility is that the portosystemic collat￾erals simply did not resolve and were not ligated by the
transplant surgeons. It is the case, however, that posttrans￾plant portal hypertension can develop, if not promote, these
collaterals.
Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunts
TIPS is the most common interventional radiology procedure
performed for portal hypertension recurrence after liver
transplantation. TIPS is performed in up to 2% of transplant
recipients, and TIPS in transplanted livers represents up to 5
to 6% of all TIPS.41 The primary leading causes of requiring a
TIPS is viral hepatitis recurrence (especially hepatitis C) and
primary hepatic graft failure.40–42 Approximately 80 to 90% of
transplants undergoing TIPS are placed due to a transudative
complication (ascites and/or hepatic hydrothorax) of portal
hypertension.40,41
There are no great differences in the technical steps of a
TIPS in a transplanted liver compared with TIPS in a native
liver. Furthermore, TIPS in transplanted whole grafts appears
to be no more technically challenging than TIPS in native
livers41 However, TIPS in whole grafts may be more challeng￾ing in institutions where piggyback anastomoses (end-to￾side cava-to-cava hepatic graft venous outflow anastomosis)
are performed commonly, especially when the piggyback is
angulated downward.41 TIPS in split grafts, especially left lobe
split grafts in children, are also typically more challenging
than in native livers.40,41,43 This is due to several reasons: split
grafts are small livers with less distance to enter the portal
vein target; the orientation is backward in left-sided grafts,
and interventionalists are used to a right lobe orientation;
undersized grafts (typically split grafts) undergo compensa￾tory hypertrophy that is not necessarily uniform and thus the
grafts grow nonuniformly; and the graft is rotated, causing
unconventional portohepatic venous orientations.41,43
The clinical outcomes of TIPS in transplants appear to be
worse when compared with native livers.40,41 First, TIPS in
transplants appear to lead to a worse response in the treat￾ment of ascites when compared with native livers.40,41 Sec￾ond, hepatic grafts appear to be more susceptible to the post￾TIPS changes in portal hemodynamics. The MELD (Model for
End-Stage Liver Disease) score threshold for livers that do well

after TIPS appears to be lower in transplants (MELD of 15 to
17) compared with native livers (MELD of 17 to 19).41,43,44
Balloon-Occluded Retrograde Transvenous
Obliteration (BRTO)
BRTO of gastric varices, or any form of embolization of porto￾systemic collaterals in liver transplant recipients, have rarely
been reported in large numbers within case series to draw any
definite conclusion regarding liver transplantation per se.
The indications for BRTO in the treatment of gastric varices/
splenorenal shunts in liver transplant recipients includes gas￾tric variceal bleeding or impending bleeding; encephalopathy;
portal venous steal from the hepatic graft (significant portal
hepatofugal flow); and as an adjunct to other portal vein
procedures for posttransplant portal vein complications (PVS
or PVT).45 Although the first two indications are not specific to
the transplant population, the last two indications are. The
concept of occluding large or hemodynamically significant
portosystemic shunts while managing portal vein stenosis is
to optimize hepatopetal flow in the stenotic portal vein to the
portal-venous deprived hepatic graft, and to maintain patency
of the portal vein by reducing the risk of PVT.
However, using BRTO in the treatment of patients with
PVT poses a dilemma. On one hand, closure of a large
hepatofugal portosystemic collateral diverts blood toward
the liver and maximizes the inflow to the recently opened
portal vein, reducing the risk of rethrombosis. However, on
the other hand, the large hepatofugal portosystemic collateral
may be the only outflow of the mesenteric veins in the
presence of portal vein rethrombosis. In that scenario (throm￾bosed portal vein and loss of the “back-up” spontaneous
hepatofugal mesenteric outflow), patients may present
with mesenteric engorgement, ischemia, and/or thrombosis.
Because all spontaneous portosystemic shunts are extrahe￾patic, there are no differences in the technical aspects of BRTO
in a transplanted liver compared with BRTO in a native liver.
Conclusion
Portal complications after liver transplantation are rare.
Minimally invasive image-guided transcatheter techniques
are technically and clinically effective in managing posttrans￾plant portal complications. TIPS in whole-graft transplants is
technically no more challenging than TIPS in native livers;
however, TIPS in split grafts may be more technically chal￾lenging. Moreover, TIPS has a lesser clinical response in
patients with transplants compared with patients with native
(nontransplanted) liver cirrhosis. Technically, BRTO is no
different in native livers and nontransplant recipients be￾cause it is by definition an extrahepatic procedure. However,
the scarcity of reporting of BRTO in transplants in the litera￾ture does not enable us to define clinical outcomes.
