Abstract
Intracardiac grafts comprised of genetically modified skele￾tal myoblasts were assessed for their ability to effect long￾term delivery of recombinant transforming growth factor￾j3 (TGF-8) to the heart. C2C12 myoblasts were stably
transfected with a construct comprised of an inducible me￾tallothionein promoter fused to a modified TGF-131 cDNA.
When cultured in medium supplemented with zinc sulfate,
cells carrying this transgene constitutively secrete active
TGF-fi1. These genetically modified myoblasts were used to
produce intracardiac grafts in syngeneic C3Heb/FeJ hosts.
Viable grafts were observed as long as three months after
implantation, and immunohistological analyses of mice
maintained on water supplemented with zinc sulfate re￾vealed the presence of grafted cells which stably expressed
TGF-fi1. Regions of apparent neovascularization, as evi￾denced by tritiated thymidine incorporation into vascular
endothelial cells, were observed in the myocardium which
bordered grafts expressing TGF-fi1. The extent of vascular
endothelial cell DNA synthesis could be modulated by alter￾ing dietary zinc. Similar effects on the vascular endothelial
cells were not seen in mice with grafts comprised of non￾transfected cells. This study indicates that genetically modi￾fied skeletal myoblast grafts can be used to effect the local,
long-term delivery of recombinant molecules to the heart. (J.

Introduction
Cellular grafting has emerged as an accepted approach for the
delivery of therapeutic agents to patients. For example, intrace￾rebral grafting of fetal adrenal tissue in Parkinson's patients has
gained support as an effective means to supplement dopamine
levels (for review see reference 1). More recently, the use of
genetically modified cells for the delivery of recombinant mole￾cules has emerged as a powerful approach for ex vivo gene
therapy. Several experimental animal models which use a vari￾ety of cell types to deliver recombinant molecules to the brain,
thymus, and hematopoietic system have recently appeared (for
review see references 2-5). Using an analogous approach in
humans, autologous transplantation of bone marrow cells

transfected with an adenosine deaminase expression construct
has been used in an attempt to treat patients lacking this enzyme
(6). More recently, ex vivo gene therapy with autologous hepa￾tocytes has been successfully used to target expression of re￾combinant LDL receptor in a patient with familial hypercholes￾terolaemia, resulting in an improved plasma LDL/HDL ra￾tio (7).
Skeletal myoblasts possess several attributes which have
proven to be beneficial for grafting experiments, particularly
into muscle beds. For example, primary myoblasts can be iso￾lated from numerous species including humans; the use of autol￾ogous grafts comprised of amplified primary myoblasts could
eliminate immune rejection. In addition, skeletal myoblasts are
genetically tractable, thereby allowing the introduction of re￾combinant genes in vitro. When engrafted into the skeletal mus￾cle beds of mdx mice, primary myoblasts from normal mice
differentiated and fused with diseased host myotubes (8). The
resulting heterokaryons expressed dystrophin. Heterokaryon
formation in these models was dependent upon the ability of
myoblasts to traverse the basal lamina of pre-existing myotubes
(9). These later observations suggested that myoblast grafting
might constitute a potential therapeutic intervention for Duchen￾ne's patients. Although initial efforts to treat patients with this
approach appear to have attained some degree of success in that
a limited number of dystrophin-positive cells could be detected
in muscle biopsies from engrafted patients (10), the procedure
is not without controversy (11).
Genetically modified skeletal myoblast grafts have been suc￾cessfully used to deliver recombinant proteins in experimental
animals. Stably transfected myoblasts injected intramuscularly
into the limbs of mice effectively elevated plasma growth hor￾mone levels for up to 80 d after grafting (12, 13). In more
recent studies primary myoblasts transfected with a tyrosine
hydroxylase expression construct have been engrafted into the
brain of rats with unilateral striatal denervation (14). Dopamine
and L-DOPA secretion from the grafted myocytes correlated
inversely with rotational behavior in this surgical model of Par￾kinson's disease.
The use of intracardiac grafting to effect long-term delivery
of recombinant proteins could induce a beneficial response in
the myocardium. For example, grafts expressing angiogenic fac￾tors might induce neovascularization. Grafts expressing neuro￾trophic agents near an infarcted region might ameliorate the
arrhythmogenesis associated with the border zone (15). Given
the potential therapeutic value of long-term recombinant protein
delivery in the heart, we initiated a series of experiments aimed
at identifying cell types capable of forming stable grafts in the
myocardium. Our initial study used AT-I cells, a differentiated
cardiomyocyte tumor line derived from transgenic mice which
express the SV40 large T antigen oncogene in the atrium (for
review see reference 16). AT-1 cardiomyocytes formed long￾term, differentiated intracardiac grafts when introduced into the
myocardium of syngeneic animals (17). Moreover, no deleteri￾114 Koh et al.

ous effects on host cardiac function were observed. Unfortu￾nately, because AT-i cardiomyocytes are transformed, their
utility for producing long-term intracardiac grafts is somewhat
limited. Subsequent studies utilized C2C12 myoblasts to form
intracardiac grafts (18). Grafted myoblasts differentiated and
fused to form nascent myotubes within the host myocardium.
Furthermore, grafted C2C12 myoblasts withdrew from the cell
cycle upon myodifferentiation; consequently, proliferation of
graft myocytes was not an issue with this model.
The present study examined the capacity of genetically engi￾neered myoblasts to effect long term delivery of recombinant
protein to the heart. C2C12 myoblasts were stably transfected
with a fusion gene comprised of the metallothionein promoter
and a TGF-,31 cDNA. TGF-fi I's activity as an angiogenic factor
in vivo is well characterized (19). Moreover, it has recently
been suggested that TGF-f31 exhibits cardioprotective proper￾ties (20). Recombinant TGF-,f1 expression was readily detected
in grafts generated with modified C2C12 myoblasts, but not in
control grafts. Furthermore, evidence for enhanced neovascu￾larization was observed in the myocardium bordering grafts
expressing TGF-,3 1. The implication of these results with re￾spect to the potential long-term delivery of recombinant proteins
to the heart is discussed.
Methods
C2C12 cell culture and transfection. C2C12 myoblasts (American Type
Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) were maintained in the undifferenti￾ated state by culturing at low density in high glucose DME supplemented
with 20% fetal bovine serum, 1% chicken embryo extract, 100 U/ml
penicillin, and 100 /ig/ml streptomycin. For some studies, myogenic
differentiation was induced by culturing in DME supplemented with
2% horse serum and antibiotics.
Transfections utilized pPK9a, a TGF-,61 expression vector under
the control of the metallothionein promoter, kindly provided by P. Kon￾daiah (21). pPK9a was stably cotransfected with the neomycin resistance
gene into C2C12 cells by the calcium phosphate precipitation method.
Neomycin-resistant colonies were screened for expression of the recom￾binant TGF-31 transcripts in the presence of 100 uM zinc sulfate.
Myocardial grafting protocol. Immediately before injection,
transfected and control myoblasts were harvested with trypsin, washed
three times with serum-free DME, and directly injected into the ventricu￾lar myocardium of adult syngeneic C3Heb/FeJ mice (Jackson Labora￾tories, Bar Harbor MA) under open heart surgery as described (17, 18).
4-10 x 10' cells were injected in a volume of 2-3 MI using a plastic
syringe fitted with a 30-gauge needle. 1 mo after surgery, graft bearing
animals were given heavy metal (25 mM zinc sulfate in drinking water),
and treatment was continued until the termination of the experiment
(7-50 d).
Northern blot analysis. Cells were plated onto 150-mm tissue plates.
At 70-80% confluence, TGF-,l6 secretion was induced by 100 MM zinc
sulfate. After 24 h of incubation, total RNA was isolated as described
(22). 10 pg of each sample of total RNA was run on a 1.0% agarose,
1.1 M formaldehyde gel, and blotted onto a Duralon-UVTM membrane
(Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Prehybridization, hybridization, and washing
of the filters were as described (23). RNA blots were hybridized with
probes corresponding to the rat TGF-,51 cDNA (24) and glyceraldehyde￾3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)' cDNA (25).
Preparation of conditioned medium and CCL64 mink lung growth
inhibition assay. Cell lines were cultured in 100-mm tissue culture plates
in high glucose DME supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum. At

70-80% confluency, cells were washed once with serum-free medium
and then cultured in DME supplemented with 100 tg/ml BSA fraction
V for 24 h with or without either 50 or 100 ILM zinc sulfate. Conditioned
media were centrifuged, and then 1 pg/ml aprotinin, 2 pg/ml leupeptin,
and 120 ,g/ml PMSF were added. The amount of TGF-,B being secreted
into the medium was determined by the CCL64 growth inhibition assay
as described (26). TGF-,/ monoclonal antibody (Genzyme Corp., Cam￾bridge, MA) which neutralizes all three TGF-,1 forms (TGF-131, TGF-
/32, and TGF-/3) was used to block the biological activity of TGF-,3s.
Histology. For paraffin sections, hearts were initially fixed in 10%
neutral buffered formalin followed by Bouin's fixative, dehydrated
through graded alcohols, and infiltrated with paraffin under standard
procedures. Tissue blocks were then sectioned at 6 Jsm. Hematoxylin
and eosin (H and E) staining was performed directly after deparaffination
according to manufacturer's specifications (Sigma Diagnostics, St.
Louis, MO). Immunohistologic analysis of TGF-/i1 expression was as
described (27). Briefly, deparaffinized sections were hydrated and
blocked with phosphate buffered saline containing 1% BSA and 5%
goat serum. Sections were then incubated with anti-TGF-,f1 antibody
(CC-1-30-1), and signal developed with an avidin-biotin (ABC) kit
(Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA). For [3H]thymidine incor￾poration, mice were given a single injection of isotope (400 ACi at 28
Ci/mM; Amersham, Arlington Heights, IL) and sacrificed 14 h later.
The heart was removed and processed for paraffin embedding as de￾scribed above. For autoradiography, deparaffinized sections were stained
with H and E, and coated with a thin layer of photographic emulsion
(Ilford L.4; Polysciences Inc., Warrington, PA) diluted 1:1 with distilled
water. Sections were exposed for 5-7 d at 4C, and developed in Kodak
D-19 (Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY) at 20C for 4 min, washed
with distilled water for 1 min, fixed in 30% sodium thiosulfate for 10
min, and washed in distilled water. Immunohistologic analyses with
anti-von Willebrand Factor (vWf) antibody (Dako Corp., Carpinteria,
CA) was used to localize vascular endothelial cells according to the
supplier's recommendations. Monoclonal antibody against the common
leukocyte antigen (CD25; antibody M1/9.3HL; Boehringer Mannheim,
Indianapolis, IN) was used to monitor immune rejection of the targeted
recombinant TGF-#1. This antibody recognizes all lymphoid and hema￾topoietic cells, including B and T lymphocytes, monocytes, and granulo￾cytes. After treatment with primary antibody, sections were incubated
with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-rat antisera (Boeh￾ringer Mannheim), and visualized by the ABC kit according to the
manufacturer's protocol (Vector Laboratories, Inc.).
Assessment of myocardial vascular endothelial cell DNA synthesis.
To quantitate vascular endothelial DNA synthesis, samples were moni￾tored via a Sony CCD television camera mounted on a Leitz Labrolux
microscope, and images were displayed on a video monitor. The number
of synthetic vascular endothelial cells, as evidenced by tritiated thymi￾dine incorporation, which resided within 500 [.m of the graft/myocar￾dium border were counted. The cumulative length of the graft/myocar￾dium border for each experimental series was also determined. Results
are expressed as the ratio of the total number of synthetic vascular
endothelial cells divided by the cumulative length (arbitrary units) of
graft/myocardium border. Data is presented as means ± standard error.
A nested group t test was used for statistical analyses.
Results
A fusion gene comprised of the metallothionein promoter driv￾ing a modified TGF-f31 cDNA was described previously (21).
Transcriptional activity of the metallothionein promoter can be
regulated by modulating the heavy metal content of cell culture
medium. The TGF-,il cDNA carried site-directed mutations
which resulted in the conversion of cysteine223 and cysteine225
to serines. This modification (28) results in the elaboration of
a TGF-,61 molecule in which the portion of the prepro domain
which is processed to the latency associated protein (LAP) is
unable to form dimers, and consequently cannot confer latency

on mature TGF-P. Cells expressing the modified cDNA consti￾tutively secreted active TGF-/31 (21). The metallothionein￾TGF-,61 fusion gene was introduced into C2C12 myoblasts by
calcium phosphate transfection; stable transfectants were se￾lected by virtue of co-transfection with an SV40-neor transgene.
Four independent clones were isolated by this approach, and
presence of the transgene was confirmed by Southern blot analy￾sis (not shown). The relative levels of TGF-f31 expression in
the different clonal cell lines was initially assessed by Northern
blot analysis, and one line, designated C2(280), was selected
for subsequent experiments.
Expression of recombinant TGF-P1 in response to heavy
metal induction was examined in C2(280) myoblasts and myo￾tubes. Transgene transcripts (1.8 kb) were readily distinguished
from those originating from the endogenous TGF-,f1 gene (2.5
kb) by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 1 A). Addition of heavy
metal to the culture medium resulted in a marked increase of
recombinant TGF-f31 transcripts in C2(280) myoblasts and my￾otubes. As indicated above, modified TGF-,lf expressed by
C2(280) cells should have constitutive biological activity. To
directly test this, conditioned medium from C2(280) myoblasts
and myotubes was examined by the CCL-64 growth inhibition
assay (26). When induced, C2(280) cells secreted TGF-f3 at a
rate of 31 ng/106 cells/24 h, 9.6-fold more than in the uninduced
state (Fig. 1 B). Furthermore, after zinc sulfate treatment, a
very high proportion of the TGF-,f (49%) was active in neutral
conditioned medium and did not require acid activation.
C2(280) myoblasts were used to produce intracardiac grafts
in syngeneic C3Heb/FeJ mice. The presence of grafts was
readily detected in H and E stained sections (Fig. 2 A). 100%
of the animals receiving intracardiac injections of C2(280) cells
went on to develop grafts. Interestingly, H and E analysis sug￾gested that the C2(280) grafts were somewhat less differentiated
as compared with those produced with unmodified C2C12 cells
(compare Fig. 2, A and C; see also reference 18, Discussion).
The differentiated state of the engrafted C2(280) cells was fur￾ther explored by immunohistologic analysis with a monoclonal
antibody specific for skeletal myosin heavy chain; nascent myo￾tubes appeared somewhat disorganized in C2(280) grafts as
compared with control C2C12 grafts (data not shown).
Graft transgene expression was assessed by immunohistol￾ogy with an anti-TGF-fl1 antibody (27). TGF-f31 expression
was readily detected in C2(280) grafts when the host animal was
maintained on zinc supplemented water (Fig. 2 B). Furthermore,
removal of zinc resulted in a marked decrease in graft TGF-,61
expression (data not shown). As a negative control, TGF-PI1
expression was assessed in grafts produced by untransfected
C2C12 myoblasts (Fig. 2 D). As expected, TGF-fil expression
was virtually undetectable in the C2C12 grafts (Fig. 2 D). Al￾though surface electrocardiograms of either C2C12 or C2(280)
engrafted mice were normal, the relatively high heart rate in
mice might render these animals resistant to experimentally
induced arrhythmia. As such, potential arrhythmogenic effects
of chronic TGF-f61 delivery might not be detected in this model.
Given that TGF-f31 is a well known angiogenic factor (19),
several experiments were initiated to determine if augmented
blood vessel growth could be detected in the myocardium bor￾dering C2(280) grafts. The initial study employed immunohisto￾logical analysis of vWf expression. vWf is a well-established
marker for vascular endothelial cells; assessment of vWf immu￾noreactivity consistently revealed a marked tendency towards
greater capillary density in the myocardium bordering the TGF-

density observed in the myocardium bordering C2(280) and
C2C12 grafts, respectively.
The vWf immunohistological results suggested the possibil￾ity of enhanced myocardial angiogenesis in the TGF-/31 ex￾pressing animals. However, given that the heart is highly vascu￾larized to begin with, it was difficult to objectively ascertain
the extent of neovascularization using an assay measuring blood
vessel density. An assay able to monitor blood vessel growth
would provide a more useful assessment of the in vivo effects
of targeted TGF-f31 expression. Since blood vessel growth is
dependent upon the proliferation of all cellular components of
the vessel, we reasoned that assessment of [3H]thymidine incor￾116 Koh et al.

vivo effects of recombinant protein expression.
Accordingly, mice engrafted with either C2C12 or C2(280)
myoblasts were maintained on normal rodent chow without zinc
supplement for a period of 1 mo to allow the myoblasts to
terminally differentiate (given that there are trace levels of zinc
in both the drinking water and food, we have designated this
as a low zinc diet). Animals were then placed on a high zinc
diet (25 mM zinc sulfate supplement in the drinking water) for
a period of either 1 or 6.5 wk. On the final day of the procedure,
animals were given a bolus injection of [3H]thymidine, and
sacrificed 14 h later. Fig. 2 shows a representative section of
the heart from one of the C2(280) engrafted animals. The sec￾tion was stained with an anti-vWf antibody and then processed
for autoradiography. Immunofluorescence photomicroscopy
clearly revealed the presence of a large blood vessel in the
myocardium bordering the TGF-L31 expressing graft (Fig. 2 G).
Bright field analysis of the same field indicates that six of the
endothelial cells in this blood vessel were actively synthesizing
DNA, as evidenced by the presence of nuclear-localized silver
grains in the autoradiograph (Fig. 2 H). Thymidine incorpora￾tion was also evident in the underlying media; however, given
the ease with which vascular endothelial cells can be identified
in H and E stained sections, assessment of DNA synthesis in
these cells was used for quantitation purposes. As indicated

endothelial cell DNA synthesis was observed for the C2(280)
engrafted animals maintained on low dietary zinc, the differ￾ences did not reach statistical significance with the limited num￾ber of animals employed in this.study.
The TGF-/31 cDNA used in this study was isolated from a
porcine cDNA library (21). Given that this protein is foreign,
experiments were initiated to determine if an immunologic re￾sponse could be detected in C2(280) engrafted hearts. H and E
analyses failed to detect obvious monocyte infiltration in TGF-
/31 expressing C2(280) grafts (Fig. 4 A). This observation was
confirmed by immunohistology with antibody specific for the
common leukocyte antigen CD25. This antibody recognizes all
lymphoid and hematopoietic cells, including B and T lympho￾cytes, monocytes and granulocytes. No immunoreactivity was
observed in the TGF-f31 expressing C2(280) grafts from animals
maintained on high dietary zinc for a period of 6.5 wk (Fig. 4
B). Strong anti-leukocyte signal was observed in a remote blood
vessel, providing a positive control for the experiment. The
absence of a detectable immune response further supports the
contention that the observed in vivo effects in the C2(280)
engrafted hearts is due to the biological activity of TGF-,B1, as
opposed to an auto-immune phenomenon. Finally, it should be
noted that thymidine incorporation also revealed that low levels
of C2(280) myocyte DNA synthesis could be detected in ani￾mals maintained on both low and high dietary zinc. This obser￾vation is consistent with the known inhibitory effect of TGF-
/B1 on myodifferentiation (30, 31), and most likely accounts
for the somewhat undifferentiated appearance of the C2(280)
grafts mentioned above. Similar levels of DNA synthesis were
not apparent in the control C2C12 grafts which do not ex￾press recombinant TGF-fi1, in agreement with our previous
results (18).
Discussion
This study demonstrates that intracardiac grafts produced with
genetically altered C2C12 myoblasts can be used to effect long￾term delivery of recombinant proteins to the heart. C2C12 cells
transfected with a modified TGF-/31 cDNA constitutively se￾creted biologically active protein. Intracardiac grafts comprised

of these cells expressed recombinant TGF-f31 as evidenced by
immunohistologic analyses. Increased vascular endothelial cell
DNA synthesis at the graft-myocardium border accompanied
TGF-P1 expression in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting
that therapeutic responses could potentially be induced in the
myocardium using this approach.
Although this study indicates that cellular grafting ap￾proaches can be used for the long-term delivery of recombinant
molecules to the heart, the model is not without flaws. Specifi￾cally, the subpopulation of C2(280) myoblasts failing to un￾dergo terminal differentiation, as evidenced by tritiated thymi￾dine incorporation, deserves mention. It is well known that
exogenous growth factors, including both TGF-,31 and a- and
/3-fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), can interfere with myogenic
differentiation in culture (30-32). A recent study has shown
that activated protein kinase C (PKC) mimics the effects of
TGF-f31 and FGFs on myodifferentiation (33). This study fur￾ther demonstrated that FGF stimulation induced PKC-mediated
phosphorylation of myogenin, a modification which renders the
protein unable to bind to DNA and thus unable to actuate the
myodifferentiation program. Consequently, the observed effect
of metallothionein/TGF-,6l transgene expression on graft myo￾differentiation in vivo was not surprising. Indeed, the appear￾ance of thymidine incorporation in graft myocytes is indicative
of their failure to achieve complete terminal differentiation in
this model, and is in contrast to our previous results (18) as
well as with the nontransfected control grafts in this study.
Although the effects of TGF-/31 on the myodifferentiation
of engrafted cells precludes the use of myoblast-mediated deliv￾ery in a clinical setting, it is nonetheless noteworthy that vascu￾lar endothelial cell DNA synthesis was markedly increased in
hearts with C2(280) grafts as compared with the C2C12 con￾trols. Recent studies suggest that vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF) is rapidly induced in response to TGF-,3 stimula￾tion (Kari Alitalo, personal communication). Thus, VEGF may
mediate the apparent TGF-,61 induced angiogenesis seen in this
model. VEGF is an hypoxia-induced angiogenic factor which
is thought to play a critical role in tumor growth (for review
see reference 34). Unlike other putative angiogenic factors, the
mitogenic activities of VEGF appear to be endothelial cell spe￾cific (35). It has been recently shown that VEGF is a high
affinity ligand for a receptor tyrosine kinase known as flk- I (for
fetal liver kinase-l, see reference 36). In situ analyses show
correlations in the spatial and temporal patterns of VEGF and
flk-l expression in developing mouse embryos, lending further
support to the notion that VEGF is a major regulator of angio￾genesis. Given these considerations, long-term expression of
VEGF in intracardiac grafts might induce neovascularization in
the adult myocardium without the deleterious effects on myodif￾ferentiation observed with TGF-,61 in the present study.
Several other approaches to effect long-term delivery of
recombinant molecules to the myocardium have recently been
described. One approach is based on the observation that DNA
injected directly into skeletal muscle beds is expressed in vivo
(37). Subsequent studies from several groups have shown that
this approach is also viable in the heart (38, 39). Although the
injected DNA exhibited relatively low transfection efficiencies
and a highly variable half-life in the initial studies, reporter
gene expression as long as 19 mo after injection into skeletal
muscle has recently been reported (40). The injected DNA re￾mained episomal and did not replicate in this study. A second
approach being explored for myocardial gene therapy relies
on the use of recombinant adenovirus. Cardiomyocytes can be
efficiently transfected in vitro with recombinant adenoviruses
(41). Moreover, long-term reporter gene expression was ob￾served in both skeletal and cardiac muscle following intrave￾nous delivery of recombinant virus in mice (42). In other stud￾ies, adenovirus was readily delivered to both the coronary vas￾culature and to heart muscle via cardiac catheterization in
rabbits (43). These approaches hold great promise for the deliv￾ery of gene products to the myocardium, although problems are
currently encountered with both temporal limitations of
transgene expression and "down-streaming" effects (i.e., vi￾ruses delivered to the myocardium can find their way to other
organs via the blood stream). This latter problem might be
solved by the use of cell type-specific promoters.
Myocardial gene therapy via intracardiac grafting may offer
several technical advantages over these alternative approaches.
For example, since transgene expression can be assessed in
vitro before grafting, and since the transfected DNA is stably
integrated, recombinant protein delivery should not be subjected
to the temporal limitations currently encountered with direct
DNA injections and adenoviral transfections. Indeed, in this
study high levels of TGF-,31 expression were observed as long
as 3 mo after grafting, the latest time point assessed to date. In
addition, packaging constraints impose limits on the size of
viral recombinant genes. Such constraints are not encountered
with myoblast transfection. Consequently, large genes (or alter￾natively a number of different genes) can be expressed in en￾grafted myotubes. Although the grafting of autologous my￾oblasts should reduce immune rejection concerns, the frequency
at which clonal lines of transfected primary cells can be gener￾ated remains to be established. In the event that batch transfec￾tions of primary myoblasts are used, prescreening for high levels
of transgene expression is not practical. Finally, conditional
cell-lethal transgenes (as for example, a herpes TK transgene)
can be incorporated into grafted myocytes to facilitate reversible
delivery, provided that elimination of the engrafted cells does
not induce overt scar formation.
The first report of successful intracardiac myoblast grafting
utilized unmodified C2C12 myoblasts. Engrafted cells were
identified by immunohistological staining with an anti-skeletal
myosin heavy chain antibody (18). Although unlikely, it re￾mained a formal possibility that the intracardiac grafts observed
in this previous study may have arisen as a consequence of
C2C12 myoblast-mediated induction of myogenic differentia￾tion in host cardiac fibroblasts. In contrast, the present study
used genetically modified myoblasts. The observed expression
of recombinant TGF-f31 confirms that the grafts did not arise
via a mechanism relying on the myoconversion of cardiac fi￾broblasts.
In summary, this study demonstrates that genetically modi￾fied skeletal myoblasts can successfully target long-term expres￾sion of biologically active recombinant protein when grafted
into the myocardium. Long-term expression of recombinant
TGF-fi1 was accompanied by increased DNA synthesis in vas￾cular endothelial cells, consistent with a sustained angiogenic
response. In addition, several other approaches are currently
being developed to effect cardiac gene therapy. In now remains
to be determined if local, long-term delivery of therapeutic
agents via somatic cell gene therapy is superior to traditional
pharmacological approaches.
