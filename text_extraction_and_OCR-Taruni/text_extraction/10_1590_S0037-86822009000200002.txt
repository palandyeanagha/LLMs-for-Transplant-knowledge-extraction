Abstract
A study was conducted on all newborns from mothers with Chagas disease who were attended at Hospital Donación F. Santojanni between January 
1, 2001, and August 31, 2007. Each child was investigated for the presence of Trypanosoma cruzi parasitemia through direct examination of blood 
under the microscope using the buffy coat method on three occasions during the first six months of life. Serological tests were then performed. Ninety￾four children born to mothers infected with Trypanosoma cruzi were attended over the study period. Three of these children were born to mothers 
coinfected with the human immunodeficiency virus. Vertical transmission of Chagas disease was diagnosed in 13 children, in all cases by identifying 
parasitemia. The overall Chagas disease transmission rate was 13.8% (13/94). It was 100% (3/3) among the children born to mothers with HIV 
infection and 10.9% (10/91) among children born to mothers without HIV [Difference = 0.89; CI95 = 0.82–0.95; p = 0.0021]. We concluded that 
coinfection with HIV could increase the risk of vertical transmission of Chagas disease.

Resumo 
Foi realizado um estudo com todos os recém nascidos de mães chagásicas atendidas no Hospital Donación F. Santojanni, no período de1 de janeiro de 
2001 a 31 de agosto de 2007. Cada criança foi submetida a pesquisa de parasitemia por Trypanosoma cruzi através do exame microscópico direto 
do sangue pelo método buffy coat, em três oportunidades, nos primeiros seis meses de vida. Após, foram realizados exames sorológicos. Foram 
avaliadas 94 crianças nascidas de mães infectadas com Trypanosoma cruzi durante o período do estudo. Três destas crianças eram filhas de mães 
co-infectadas pelo vírus da imunodeficiência humana. A transmissão vertical de doença de Chagas foi diagnosticada em 13 crianças, todos os casos 
por identificação de parasitemia. A taxa de transmissão global de doença de Chagas foi de 13,8% (13/94); 100% (3/3) entre os recém nascidos de 
mães infectadas com HIV e de 10,9% (10/91) entre as crianças nascidas de mães sem HIV [Diferenta=0,89; IC95=0,82–0,95; p=0,0021]. Concluímos 
que a co-infecção com HIV pode aumentar o risco de transmissão vertical de doença de Chagas.

Chagas disease is a major source of morbidity and mortality 
in Latin America. The World Health Organization (WHO) has 
estimated that 16 to 18 million people are currently infected with 
Trypanosoma cruzi and that nearly 300,000 patients become 
infected and 21,000 die each year (UNICEF, UNDP, World Bank, 
WHO Special Program for Research and Training in Tropical 
Diseases: Chagas disease; accessed at http://www.who.int/tdr/
diseases/chagas/diseaseinfo.htm).
Because of vector control efforts in several countries, 
transmission through insect bites is decreasing. Thus, vertical 
transmission has become more important today. In fact, it is 
estimated that in Argentina vertical cases are at least 10 times more 
frequent than are acute cases due to vector transmission3
. 
Overlapping of human immunodeficiency virus and 
Trypanosoma cruzi infection occurs not only in endemic areas 
but also in non-endemic areas of North America and Europe. 
Reactivation of Chagas disease in individuals with human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and chronic Trypanosoma 
cruzi infection has been reported but no experiences of vertical 
transmission in such settings have yet been communicated. 
We conducted a study in an area without the risk of Chagas 
disease transmission through vectors or transfusion, to see 
whether coinfection with the human immunodeficiency virus could 
affect vertical transmission of American trypanosomiasis. 
Material and MethodS
We conducted a study on all children born to mothers with 
Chagas disease who were attended at Hospital Donación F. Santojanni 

108
Scapellato PG et al
between January 1, 2001, and August 31, 2007. The mothers’ 
serological status of Chagas disease was studied by means of indirect 
hemagglutination, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and latex 
agglutination. Positive test results from two methods were required for 
a diagnosis of Chagas disease in the mothers to be made. HIV status was 
assessed by means of the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; positive 
tests results were confirmed using Western blot.
Trypanosoma cruzi parasitemia was investigated in the children 
through direct examination of blood under the microscope using 
the buffy coat method on three occasions over the first six months 
of life. Serological tests were then performed.
Children were diagnosed as cases of vertically transmitted 
Chagas disease if they presented either parasitemia or two positive 
serological tests after six months of life.
Results
Ninety-four children were born to mothers with chronic 
Trypanosoma cruzi infection over the study period. Three of these 
children were born to one mother presenting HIV coinfection. The 
remaining mothers tested negative for HIV.
Vertical Chagas disease transmission was diagnosed in 13 
children. All of them were diagnosed through parasitemia. 
All of the 81 children who were negative for parasitemia 
presented negative serological tests at the age of six months. 
The overall Chagas disease transmission rate was 13.8% 
(13/94). It was 100% (3/3) among the children born to the 
mother with HIV infection and 10.9% (10/91) among the children 
born to mothers without HIV [difference = 0.89; CI95 for difference 
= 0.82 – 0.95; p = 0.0021].
Symptoms of acute Chagas disease were present in 1/3 
children born to the mother with HIV and in 2/10 children born 
to non-HIV mothers.
The prevalence of low birth weight among the Chagas disease 
children was 2/3 among the children born to the mother with HIV 
and 2/10 among the children born to mothers without a diagnosis 
of HIV [p = ns].
The prematurity rate at birth was 2/3 among the children 
born to the HIV-positive mother and 3/10 among the children with 
Chagas disease born to HIV-negative mothers [p = ns].
Among the children born to HIV-negative mothers, eight of 
them were four pairs of siblings, and another three were siblings 
born to one mother. In only one case did one of the two siblings 
acquire Chagas disease while the other did not.
None of the children born to the mother with HIV acquired it.
Discussion
Several authors have reported vertical Trypanosoma cruzi
transmission rates ranging from 2% to 10.4%2
. The factors 
associated with vertical Chagas disease transmission are not well 
understood.
Geographical issues (probably relating to the regional 
distribution of different strains of Trypanosoma cruzi) were 
considered. The rates of vertical Chagas disease transmission are 
higher in Argentina than in Brazil2
. 
Prematurity and low birth weight could be important for 
determining the risk of vertical Chagas disease transmission2 3 4. 
We did not find any difference regarding either of these factors 
between the children with Chagas disease born to HIV-infected 
mothers and those born to mothers without HIV.
The strain of Trypanosoma cruzi could be an important factor 
in mother-to-child transmission of American trypanosomiasis. In a 
study conducted on mice, Andrade found that the placental infection 
rate was influenced by the strain of Trypanosoma cruzi1
.
The three children born to an HIV-infected mother were 
siblings, and therefore we cannot dismiss the possibility that 
intrinsic maternal factors could be involved. In an epidemiological 
study, Sánchez-Negrete et al4
 found that siblings of an infant 
infected with Trypanosoma cruzi were at high risk of infection 
themselves4
. We could not clarify this point because of the small 
size of our sample, but the only sibling of a child with Chagas 
disease born to a mother without HIV infection in our sample did 
not acquire Chagas disease.
The level of parasitemia could be a major factor determining 
the risk of mother-to-child transmission. Storino et al reported a 
vertical transmission rate of 71% in rare cases of acute maternal 
Chagas disease2
, i.e. much higher than the rates of 5% to 10% 
communicated in cases of chronic maternal trypanosomiasis.
The level of parasitemia was higher in the individuals 
coinfected with HIV. In a study conducted by Sartori, Trypanosoma 
cruzi parasitemia was detected significantly more frequently 
in HIV-positive than in HIV-negative subjects, and HIV-infected 
patients also had higher levels of parasitemia5
.
We think that high levels of parasitemia, as found in HIV￾infected patients, could favor higher rates of vertical transmission 
of Chagas disease, as seen among children born to mothers with 
acute American trypanosomiasis.
Even if Chagas disease transmission via breastfeeding can 
be disregarded, this is an exceptional means of infection6
. The 
children born to the HIV-infected mother were not breastfed.
This was a small and retrospective report, but we think 
it provides an initial piece in the puzzle of elucidating the 
interactions between the human immunodeficiency virus and 
Trypanosoma cruzi within the setting of vertical transmission 
of Chagas disease.
