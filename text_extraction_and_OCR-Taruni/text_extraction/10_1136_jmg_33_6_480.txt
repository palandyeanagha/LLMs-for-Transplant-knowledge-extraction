A cross sectional study of renal involvement in
tuberous sclerosis
J A Cook, K Oliver, R F Mueller, J Sampson
Abstract
Renal disease is a frequent manifestation
oftuberous sclerosis (TSC) and yet little is
known about its true prevalence or natural
history. We reviewed the notes of 139
people with TSC, who had presented with￾out renal symptoms, but who had been
investigated by renal ultrasound. In￾formation on the frequency, type, and
symptomatology of renal involvement was
retrieved.
The prevalence ofrenal involvement was
61%. Angiomyolipomas were detected in
49%, renal cysts in 32%, and renal car￾cinoma in 2-2%. The prevalence of an￾giomyolipoma was positively correlated
with age, compatible with a two hit aeti￾ology. Renal cysts were the commoner
lesion in young children, and their pre￾valence did not appear to be age related.
Renal investigation in people with TSC
had been inconsistent and limited. We sug￾gest guidelines for renal investigation in
those with TSC.
(7Med Genet 1996;33:480-484)
Key words: tuberous sclerosis; angiomyolipoma; renal
cyst.
There are two characteristic types of renal
involvement in persons with TSC. (1) An￾giomyolipomas. These are benign neoplasms
composed of mature adipose tissue, thick
walled blood vessels, and smooth muscle in
varying proportions. In the general population
they are a rare finding affecting predominantly
women (80%) in the third to fifth decade.
About 50% of people with angiomyolipomas
have no stigmata of TSC and usually have
a large, single angiomyolipoma.6 In TSC the
angiomyolipomas tend to be small, multiple,
and bilateral.7 Stillwell et al7 suggested that
there was an increase in the prevalence of
angiomyolipomas with age but only a limited
number of persons with TSC were studied.
(2) Renal cysts. These have a characteristic
histology in TSC. They are lined with a hy￾perplastic epithelium consisting of eosinophilic,
columnar cells with a "piled up" appearance.
This allows them to be differentiated from both
autosomal recessive and autosomal dominant
polycystic kidney disease. They can arise from
all portions of the nephron and are char￾acteristically bilateral, multiple, and of variable
Q
size.
A number of reports have also suggested that
there may be an increased incidence of renal
carcinoma in TSC.7

Tuberous sclerosis (TSC) is an inherited auto￾somal dominant neurocutaneous syndrome
and figures suggested for the incidence of TSC
vary from 1 in 6000 to 1 in 15000.1 The
clinical manifestations result from hamartomas
involving multiple organ systems, including the
brain, skin, eye, lung, heart, and kidney. The
involvement in persons with TSC can vary
from very mild (a few skin lesions, a specific
neuroradiological finding of TSC on CT scan,
but no evidence of fits or mental retardation)
to severe with fits which are difficult to control,
mental retardation, and severe skin and visceral
involvement.2
TSC exhibits locus heterogeneity with clin￾ically indistinguishable disease being caused by
mutations in two different genes. One gene
(TSC2) has been identified on chromosome
16' and a second gene (TSC1) has been loc￾alised on chromosome 9.4
Renal disease is the second commonest cause
of death in patients with TSC after central
nervous system causes and the commonest
cause of death in those over the age of 30.' If
better management of neurological com￾plications through improved imaging, anti￾epileptics, and neurosurgery improves survival,
renal involvement might be expected to become
a more important medical complication of
TSC.
Methods
A renal database for TSC was created. In order
to be added to the renal database, people with
TSC had to fulfil the following criteria: (1)
they met the definitive diagnostic criteria for
TSC2; (2) the date of birth was known; (3) the
patient had had a renal ultrasound, the results
were accessible, and the date of the scan was
known.
In an attempt to eliminate possible bias,
patients who presented because of symptoms
owing to renal involvement before the diagnosis
of TSC was made were not included. Over 450
sets of case notes were reviewed in the two
centres (Leeds and Cardiff) which led to 139
persons with TSC being added to the database.
The information that was extracted from the
notes included the reason for initial referral
and symptoms and signs of TSC, including
renal symptoms and signs. Results and timing

A total of 139 patients (57 male and 82 female)
were entered on the database. Their ages
ranged from 1 month to 66 years (mean age
19, median age 19). The reasons for referral
for these patients are listed in table 1. Of these
139 patients, 116 were probands and 23 were

secondarily ascertained affected relatives. It had
been hoped to compare data from the two
groups, as secondarily ascertained relatives with
TSC often have milder involvement than prob￾ands. However, the group was too small for
meaningful comparison.
Of the 139 patients studied, 85 (61%) had
renal lesions, 58% of the males and 63% of
the females. Of these, 12 had also had renal
CT scans which had confirmed the findings on
ultrasound. Most patients with renal lesions
were asymptomatic. Only 13 out of 85 patients
(15%) had any symptoms (table 2). The com￾monest symptom was frank haematuria which
occurred in 9/13 symptomatic patients (9.4%
of all patients with renal lesions). Haematuria
was associated with angiomyolipomas in the
majority of cases (8/9). The incidence ofmicro￾scopic haematuria may be much greater than
this but, almost invariably, routine urine micro￾scopy was not carried out.
Other symptoms included abdominal pain
and recurrent urinary tract infections. Ab￾dominal pain occurred in four patients, all of
whom had angiomyolipomas. Blood pressure
was only recorded in one set of notes. Of the
139 patients' notes we examined, only 45 had
a documented urea, creatinine, and electrolyte
result. Only four patients had a serum cre￾atinine level outside the normal range and none
had reached end stage renal failure. Creatinine
clearance levels had been performed for two of
these patients and were impaired in both. There
was an equal distribution of angiomyolipomas
and cysts among the four patients with impaired
renal function, two had both angiomyolipomas
and cysts, one had angiomyolipomas only, and
one had cysts only.
Two patients had required embolisation of
bleeding angiomyolipomas and one had re￾quired a nephrectomy because of massive
haemorrhage from an angiomyolipoma leading
to necrosis of the kidney. A second patient
had a nephrectomy because massive kidney
enlargement from angiomyolipomas within the
kidney and in the perirenal fat was thought to
have led to portal vein obstruction. This case
is complicated as the patient also has protein
C deficiency and it is unclear whether the
obstruction was the result of thrombosis or an
external pressure effect from the angio￾myolipomas.
We analysed the prevalence and type of renal
involvement by sex (table 3). The proportion
of males and females with renal lesions did not
differ significantly. Angiomyolipomas were the
commonest lesion, occurring in 49% of all
patients. Of those with angiomyolipomas, 91%
had multiple lesions and 84% had bilateral
lesions (table 4). Cysts occurred in 32% of all
patients, with 91% having multiple cysts and
82% having bilateral cysts (table 4). Angio￾myolipomas and cysts occurred together in
20% of all patients.
The data were also analysed by age at time
of radiological examination (tables 5 and 6, figs
1 and 2). The incidence of renal angio￾myolipomas increased with age. The product
moment correlation coefficient'0 was 0-91
(p<005) indicating significant positive cor￾481

of angiomyolipoma. The incidence of renal
cysts did not show a significant positive cor￾relation with age (correlation coefficient 0 79,
0-1<p<0.2).
Three cases of renal carcinoma were iden￾tified among the 139 patients (table 7). Only
one of these patients died from his tumour and
this was the only death in the group from renal
complications.
The prevalence of other features of TSC was
investigated to see if any were associated with
renal disease. The prevalence of facial angio￾fibromas in patients with renal involvement
was 64% compared to the reported incidence
in TSC of 70 to 83%.2 The prevalence of
mental retardation in patients with renal in￾volvement was 49% compared to the reported
incidence in TSC of 38%." These figures
would suggest that renal involvement occurs
independently of other manifestations of TSC.

Discussion
Our study confirmed that renal involvement in
tuberous sclerosis is common; 61% of patients
had renal lesions detectable by renal ultrasound
scan. However, since we did not have a large
number of secondarily ascertained patients,
this figure may still not be an accurate rep￾resentation ofthe true incidence ofrenal disease
in TSC. Most patients with renal involvement
were asymptomatic. In general, renal symp￾toms were only recorded in the notes if vo￾lunteered by the patient rather than being
specifically elicited. The incidence of renal
symptoms may be higher, particularly in the
mentally handicapped who may not be aware
of symptoms referrable to the renal tract. How￾ever, of 68 patients with angiomyolipomas,
eight (12%) had frank hiematuria and two
required embolisation to control the haem￾orrhage. This was performed percutaneously
via the femoral artery. Two further patients had
nephrectomies.
Only a third of the patients in this study had
had any investigation of renal function. In most
of these cases, urea, creatinine, and electrolytes
had been measured. A large proportion of renal
function is lost before these indices become
abnormal, but more sensitive tests of renal
function such as creatinine clearance had not
been performed in the majority of patients.
Hypertension might also be anticipated in a
group of patients with extensive renal disease,
but virtually none of the patients had had
routine blood pressure measurements. This
may reflect a lack of awareness of renal com￾plications in TSC.
Angiomyolipomas were the commonest type
of renal lesion, occurring in 49% of patients.
They were usually both multiple and bilateral.
A study by Stillwell et afi suggested that the
prevalence of angiomyolipomas increases with
age. Our study has confirmed this finding.
Although our data are limited, they indicate
that females with TSC develop angiomyo￾lipomas at a younger age than the males. This
was also suggested by the smaller study ofWebb
et al.'2 The results from our study, however,
are not statistically significant (0.5<p<O0 1) and
greater numbers are needed to confirm or refute
this suggestion. It may be relevant that an￾giomyolipomas in non-TSC patients (which
are generally solitary) are also much commoner
in females than males.6 Although hormonal
factors are a possible explanation for this ob￾servation, it is not clear why females with TSC
have a greater likelihood of developing an￾giomyolipomas compared to males, under the
age of 10.
Green et al"3 have suggested that a two hit
mechanism involving somatic loss ofthe normal
TSC allele leads to formation of angio￾myolipomas and other hamartomatous lesions
seen in TSC. While an age related increase in
prevalence of angiomyolipomas is consistent
with this model, the sex difference observed in
angiomyolipomas indicates that other factors
are also involved.
As most angiomyolipomas in TSC are bi￾lateral and multiple, management needs to be
as conservative as possible. Current re￾482

A cross sectional study of renal involvement in tuberous sclerosis
commendations take account of their size and
the presence or absence of symptoms.'4 Van
Baal et al'5 reported a relationship between
the size of angiomyolipomas and their risk of
bleeding. They suggested that small, asymp￾tomatic tumours should be monitored regularly
and recommended an aggressive approach of
prophylactic selective embolisation for tumours
greater than 3 - 5 cm before they bleed. If surgery
has to be performed to control bleeding this
should be a partial nephrectomy if possible.
The prevalence of renal cysts in our study
was 32% and the prevalence did not show
a correlation with age, suggesting a different
developmental basis to that of angiomyo￾lipomas. The incidence of renal cysts did rise
in the over 30 age group, but so does the
incidence of renal cysts in the general popu￾lation"6 and this may be complicating the pic￾ture. Two of the patients in this age group had
single cysts.
In children under the age of 5 years cysts were
a more common lesion than angiomyolipomas.
Renal cysts in TSC have been reported ante￾natally'7 and in a neonate at birth, when they
were seen to enlarge over a period of months.'8
Because other features of TSC are frequently
absent in infancy some cases have initially and
erroneously been diagnosed as having auto￾somal recessive polycystic kidney disease or
infantile presentation of autosomal dominant
polycystic kidney disease.'9 More recently,
some infants with severe polycystic kidneys
have been shown to have a contiguous deletion
of the TSC2 gene and the adjacent autosomal
dominant polycystic kidney disease gene,
PKD 1 .20
Yu et al2' and Okada et al22 have suggested
that the major predisposing factor in the de￾velopment of renal failure in people with TSC
is the presence of cystic disease. In our series
only four patients had recognised renal im￾pairment. Of these two both had angiomyo￾lipomas and cysts, one had angiomyolipomas
only, and one had cysts only.
Three patients in the study developed renal
cell carcinoma, all three having coexisting an￾giomyolipomas and cysts. The incidence of
renal cell carcinoma in the general population
is 7-5/100 000. When Washecka et at' reviewed
published reports on malignant tumours in
TSC, they noted that half the tumours reported
were bilateral compared to the population in￾cidence of bilateral tumours which is 1-6 to
3 - 8%. The median age for development ofrenal
carcinoma in the general population is about
60. In our study the patients were aged 27, 35,
and 65 years. Although our numbers are small
they would appear to add to the body of evi￾dence suggesting that there is an increased
incidence of renal cell carcinoma in TSC.
None ofthe patients in our study had reached
end stage renal failure, but both dialysis and
renal transplantation have been undertaken
successfully in patients with TSC."3 Most TSC
patients receiving renal replacement therapy
have had only minor CNS dysfunction, possibly
reflecting the unwillingness of doctors to take
on dialysis and transplantation in the mentally
handicapped patient. In view of the apparent
increased risk of renal carcinoma in TSC it
has been suggested that bilateral nephrectomy
should be performed before transplantation. If
this is not done the native kidneys should be
routinely evaluated with ultrasound.
This study has shown that a majority of
patients with TSC develop renal involvement
and that in a minority of cases this results in
significant morbidity. However, we have found
that comprehensive renal assessment is rarely
undertaken. The study highlights the need for
a large longitudinal study on which recom￾mendations for renal surveillance can be based.
We are now collecting data prospectively and
are using the following guidelines. We un￾dertake a baseline ultrasound of the kidneys in
all patients. In those without evidence of renal
involvement, we suggest that renal ultrasound
should be repeated at least every five years. Van
Baal et all5 have suggested that, in cases with
renal disease, follow up scans be performed at
six monthly intervals. However, in their study
only 20% of patients with angiomyolipomas
showed an increase in size of the lesions after
five years of follow up. We are adopting a more
conservative regimen and perform follow up
scans every one to two years. If there is any
doubt about the nature of a lesion a CT or
MRI scan can help to differentiate between
angiomyolipoma and carcinoma.
Regular blood pressure measurements and
tests of renal function should be performed if
there is extensive renal involvement. Ifpossible,
episodes of bleeding should be treated con￾servatively by embolisation ofindividual lesions
and, if this is not possible, by partial neph￾rectomy rather than total nephrectomy.
Prophylactic embolisation of large angio￾myolipomas may be considered but more data
on the risk of haemorrhage are required before
guidelines can be drawn up. Dialysis and trans￾plantation should be considered for patients in
end stage renal failure.
Further work needs to be done to assess
whether specific subgroups of TSC patients are
at risk of developing renal insufficiency. Serial
renal ultrasounds will provide further information
on the natural history of renal disease in TSC
and this may allow future modification of the
suggested surveillance protocols. Longitudinal
studies may also provide insights into the aeti￾ology of renal carcinoma in persons with TSC.
