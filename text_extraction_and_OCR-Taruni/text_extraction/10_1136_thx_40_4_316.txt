Multiple microscopic pulmonary arteriovenous connections in the lungs
presenting as cyanosis

Pulmonary arteriovenous fistulae have been well described
in the published reports'; the right to left shunt produces
arterial oxygen desaturation, cyanosis, finger clubbing, and
murmurs over the lung fields. Most arteriovenous fistulae
are relatively large and can be diagnosed by pulmonary
angiography.' Multiple small pulmonary arteriovenous
fistulae, or telangiectasia, are rare,2 and usually occur in
hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (Osler-Rendu￾Weber syndrome). Very rarely these fistulae are minute
and may not be recognised by pulmonary angiography.3
The association between chronic liver disease and multiple
pulmonary arteriovenous anastomoses is also well recog￾nised.4 5
The patient reported here is unusual in that he presented
with cyanosis and finger clubbing without apparent cause.
A subsequent diagnosis of multiple minute arteriovenous
fistulae was made on physiological and pathological
grounds, with the later discovery of underlying juvenile
hepatic fibrosis with aberrant connections between the sys￾temic arterial and pulmonary venous circulations.
Case report
A 19 year old boy had first presented in 1977 aged 14 after
his relatives had noticed that his lips had become blue in
the preceding three months. He was symptom free, led a
healthy and unrestricted life, and was a keen competitive
sportsman. He gave no relevant family history. He was
thin, of average height for his age, and deeply cyanosed
and had gross finger clubbing. No other abnormality was
noted on detailed systematic examination.
The haemoglobin was 15.0 g/dl and the packed cell vol￾ume 0.43. No abnormal haemoglobin pigments were
detected. Results of liver function tests and the electrocar￾diogram and chest radiograph were normal. Vital capacity
was reduced (2.12 1, predicted 3.55 1). TLco was reduced
to 36% of the predicted value. Remaining lung volumes
were normal. Pao2 was 7.7 kPa (58 mm Hg), Paco2 4.0
kPa (30 mm Hg), pH 7.48. Right and left heart catheterisa￾tion, the latter via a patent foramen ovale, showed normal
pressures and no evidence of an intracardiac shunt. Pul￾monary angiography showed nothing was abnormal.
Breathing 100% oxygen for 15 minutes produced on arter￾ial oxygen saturation of 100% and a Pao2 of 47.6 kPa (357

mm Hg). A ventilation lung scan with xenon 131 was nor￾mal, as was the perfusion lung scan using technetium 99m
labelled macroaggregates (labelling efficiency 95%) except
that an outline of the kidneys was noted.
The patient remained symptom free but in 1978
developed splenomegaly confirmed by liver and spleen
scintigraphy. The liver was small but showed a normal dis￾tribution of isotope. The serum bilirubin concentration was
now raised at 22 mmol/l (1.29 ,ug/100 ml), as was the
alkaline phosphatase activity at 240 units/l, which was due
to bone isoenzyme; alanine aminotransferase was normal.
Laparoscopic liver biopsy confirmed an enlarged spleen
and a small liver. The histological appearances of the liver
were compatible with very mild portal fibrosis.
As there was no definite cause for this young man's
cyanosis an open lung biopsy (lingula) was performed and
histological examination was considered initially to show
mild non-specific scarring with a histiocytic infiltrate and
occasional lymphocytes and plasma cells in the lung
stroma. The features were non-specific and not diagnostic.
The patient remained well but, because the diagnosis
was uncertain, further cardiac catheterisation was per￾formed in 1980, which again showed no evidence of an
intracardiac shunt. Pulmonary angiography showed
nothing abnormal. When the patient was at rest breathing
100% oxygen full arterial oxygen saturation could be
achieved; appreciable desaturation to 60% was induced by
exercising when breathing air, however, and this could not
be fully corrected when he breathed 100% oxygen. A
further radionuclide examination was performed with
99mTc labelled microspheres. There was no evidence of an
intracardiac shunt but activity was detected in the left ven￾tricle after passage through the lungs (fig 1). Shortly after￾wards considerable activity was detected in the kidneys and
brain. As labelling efficiency was 98% the passage through
the lungs indicated intrapulmonary "shunting' or passage
through vessels with a diameter greater than 30 (fig 1).
Because of these findings the lung biopsy material was
re-examined. Leashes of vessels running into the alveolar
walls were seen (fig 2). The vessels were excessive in size,
diameter, and number, consistent with minute arterioven￾ous fistulae. If such vessels were present diffusely through￾out the lungs, they would explain the clinical picture.
In 1982 the patient became dyspnoeic on exercise and
developed polycythaemia (Hb 17.3 g/dl; red cell mass 0.49
1/kg (normal range 0.027-0.035 1kg)). There were no new
clinical findings. The arterial Pao2 was now 5.9 kPa (44.2
mm Hg) and pulmonary arterial pressure was again nor￾mal.

in an intracardiac shunt. The curve from the right ventricle is normal. In the lung ifall the microspheres had impacted there
would be no reduction in radioactivity and a plateau would have been achieved. In this case there was considerable loss of
radioactive counts before a plateau was achieved, suggesting that a proportion ofmicrospheres had entered the lung but had
not lodged. Similar curves were obtained from upper middle and lower zones of both lungs.

fibrosis, the serum bilirubin was now raised at 42 mmol/l

dence in the peripheral blood of hypersplenism, an assess￾ment of liver haemodynamics was carried out. Portal ven￾ous pressure was raised (260 mm saline) with a normal
wedged hepatic venous pressure. Contrast injected in to
the splenic vein showed normal splenic blood flow with
patent hepatic and portal veins. Coeliac and mesenteric
angiography showed appreciable splenomegaly with a
small liver and without oesophageal varices. These results
indicate intrahepatic, presinusoidal portal hypertension,
consistent with the diagnosis of congenital hepatic fibrosis.
Finally, anomalous supply to the pulmonary veins was
noted from a branch of the left gastric artery and from an
enlarged inferior phrenic artery.
The effect of oxygen on the patient's dyspnoea was com￾pared in blind fashion at a flow rate of 3 I/min via nasal
cannulas at rest and during exercise. Arterial oxygen sat￾uration rose from 68% to 91%, and Pao2 from 5.1 to 8.8
kPa (38 to 66 mm Hg) when breathing oxygen at rest. The
12 minute walking distance increased from 576 to 650
metres when the patient breathed oxygen. He has been
supplied with portable liquid domiciliary oxygen to be used

Discussion
We have been able in this case to diagnose multiple minute
pulmonary arteriovenous anastomoses on both physiologi￾cal and pathological grounds. This is a great rarity, for
although there have been many reports of arteriovenous
fistulae only 20 cases of multiple small arteriovenous
fistulae have been described.368 Most have been visual￾ised by pulmonary angiography, and in only four previ￾ously reported cases has the angiogram been normal as in
our case. Breathing of 100% oxygen failed to reveal a right
to left shunt in our patient. This method has been shown to
underestimate the size of the shunt in patients with larger
multiple pulmonary arteriovenous anastomoses6 since, in
contrast to air breathing, at high oxygen tensions the
abnormal vessels can take part in gas exchange. The use of
injected radioisotope labelled microspheres showed in our
case intrapulmonary shunting in all regions of the lungs
and has helped in the diagnosis in two previously reported
cases.67 We had, however, additional pathological
confirmation of the diagnosis in life.
A further feature of this case is the presence of liver
disease, which can also produce cyanosis4 and pulmonary
arteriovenous fistulae.' Arterial desaturation associated
with liver disease is usually slight,5 even in the most
severely cirrhotic patients. Our patient had mildly
impaired liver function and moreover presented with
appreciable hypoxaemia before any liver dysfunction was
present, making a causal association between the two
unlikely.
The abberant connections between intra-abdominal
arteries and pulmonary veins may have resulted from the
development of cirrhosis, or arisen as a consequence of the
pulmonary telangiectasia, but they could not have contri￾buted appreciably to the hypoxaemia.
