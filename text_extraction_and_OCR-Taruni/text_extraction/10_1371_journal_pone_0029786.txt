Abstract
Background: The contribution of hypercoagulability to the pathophysiology of sickle cell disease (SCD) remains poorly
defined. We sought to evaluate the association of markers of coagulation and platelet activation with specific clinical
complications and laboratory variables in patients with SCD.
Design and Methods: Plasma markers of coagulation activation (D-dimer and TAT), platelet activation (soluble CD40
ligand), microparticle-associated tissue factor (MPTF) procoagulant activity and other laboratory variables were obtained in
a cohort of patients with SCD. Tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity was determined by Doppler echocardiography and the
presence/history of clinical complications was ascertained at the time of evaluation, combined with a detailed review of the
medical records.
Results: No significant differences in the levels of D-dimer, TAT, soluble CD40 ligand, and MPTF procoagulant activity were
observed between patients in the SS/SD/Sb0 thalassemia and SC/Sb+ thalassemia groups. Both TAT and D-dimer were
significantly correlated with measures of hemolysis (lactate dehydrogenase, indirect bilirubin and hemoglobin) and soluble
vascular cell adhesion molecule-1. In patients in the SS/SD/Sb0 thalassemia group, D-dimer was associated with a history of
stroke (p = 0.049), TAT was associated with a history of retinopathy (p = 0.0176), and CD40 ligand was associated with the
frequency of pain episodes (p = 0.039). In multivariate analyses, D-dimer was associated with reticulocyte count, lactate
dehydrogenase, NT-proBNP and history of stroke; soluble CD40 ligand was associated with WBC count and platelet count;
and MPTF procoagulant activity was associated with hemoglobin and history of acute chest syndrome.
Conclusions: This study supports the association of coagulation activation with hemolysis in SCD. The association of D￾dimer with a history of stroke suggests that coagulation activation may contribute to the pathophysiology of stroke in
clinically severe forms of SCD. More research is needed to evaluate the contribution of coagulation and platelet activation to
clinical complications in SCD.

Introduction
Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) have an increased risk of
stroke, pulmonary hypertension, avascular necrosis of large joints,
and pregnancy-related complications, all of which may be due, at
least in part, to thrombotic vascular occlusion [1]. They also appear
to have a higher risk of pulmonary embolism as well as pregnancy￾related venous thromboembolism compared with race-matched
controls without SCD [2,3]. In addition to these thrombotic
complications, patients with SCD manifest alterations in platelet
function, as well as changes in the procoagulant, anticoagulant and
fibrinolytic systems in the direction of a procoagulant phenotype [4].
Furthermore, tissue factor (TF) antigen and TF procoagulant activity
are reported to be elevated in the circulation of SCD patients when
compared with normal controls [5–7]. As a result of these findings,
SCD is frequently referred to as a ‘‘hypercoagulable state.’’
Despite the abundant laboratory evidence of hypercoagulability
observed in these patients, it still remains uncertain whether the
observed platelet activation, as well as increased thrombin and
fibrin generation contributes to the vascular occlusive episodes that
characterize SCD or are rather simple epiphenomena.
In the present study, we sought to evaluate the association of
markers of coagulation and platelet activation with specific SCD￾related clinical complications and laboratory variables in a cohort
of patients followed at an adult sickle cell clinic. In addition, we
evaluated the relationship between microparticle-associated tissue

factor procoagulant activity, plasma markers of coagulation
activation and platelet activation.
Methods
Patients and Study Design
The study subjects represent a cohort of patients followed at the
Adult Sickle Cell Clinic at the University of North Carolina
(UNC), Chapel Hill. The data were collected as part of an ongoing
study to investigate the pathophysiology of pulmonary hyperten￾sion in SCD. Sixty four patients with SCD were included in the
analyses that assessed the associations of plasma markers of
coagulation and platelet activation with both SCD-related clinical
complications and laboratory variables. Patients with SCD were
assessed while in the non-crisis, ‘‘steady state’’ (no current acute
painful episode or illness and none requiring medical intervention
for at least 1 week); had not experienced an episode of acute chest
syndrome in the 4 weeks preceding enrollment; and had no clinical
evidence of congestive heart failure. None of the patients was on
chronic red blood cell transfusion therapy. This study was
approved by the Institutional Review Board at UNC, Chapel
Hill and all subjects gave written informed consent to participate
in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
Blood Sample Collection and Preparation. The samples
from the study group were obtained during research visits while in
the non-crisis, ‘‘steady state.’’ Blood samples were obtained via
venipuncture using a 21-gauge needle and drawn into citrate￾containing tubes. Plasma samples were prepared in a manner that
minimized platelet activation as previously described [8]. The
plasma samples were aliquoted and frozen immediately at 280uC
for subsequent analysis.
Microparticle-Associated Tissue Factor (MPTF) Procoagulant
Activity. Platelet-free plasma was obtained from citrated whole
blood by centrifugation at 1,500 g for 15 minutes, followed by a
clearing spin of 13,000 g for 2 minutes. Microparticles were
isolated from platelet-free plasma by centrifugation at 21,000 g
for 30 minutes. The pellet was re-suspended in HBSA (20 mM
HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum
albumin) and re-centrifuged at 20,000 g for 30 minutes, before
the final re-suspension in 250 mL HBSA, and MPTF proco￾agulant activity was measured as previously described using a
chromogenic assay [9,10].
Plasma Markers of Thrombin Generation, Platelet
Activation and Endothelial Activation
Quantification of D-dimer (DiaPharma, Westchester, OH),
thrombin-antithrombin (TAT) complexes (Dade Behring, Marburg,
Germany), soluble CD40 ligand (R&D systems, Minneapolis, MN)
and human soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (soluble
VCAM-1) (R&D systems, Minneapolis, MN) was accomplished
using commercially available ELISA kits. Samples were assayed in
duplicate and according to manufacturer’s instructions. Measure￾ments of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP)
and other routine laboratory studies were performed by the
McClendon Clinical Laboratory at UNC Hospitals.
Sickle Cell Disease-Related Clinical Complications
The presence or history of clinical complications in SCD
patients was ascertained from a history at the time of evaluation,
combined with a detailed review of the medical records. Acute
pain episodes (or crises), acute chest syndrome, stroke and other
SCD-related complications were defined using standard defini￾tions [11–14]. Based on a modification of the definition from both
the Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease [11] and the
Multicenter Study of Hydroxyurea [12], acute pain episodes
referred to episodes that required a visit to a medical facility for
acute sickling-related pain for which treatment with a parenterally
administered analgesic was needed. Tricuspid regurgitant jet
velocity was measured by Doppler echocardiography as previously
described [15].
Statistical Analysis
Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used to compare distributions of
continuous variables in two groups. Fisher’s exact tests were used
to compare categorical variables. Spearman rank correlations were
used to identify associations between markers of coagulation
activation and specified variables (a= 0.05). Reported p-values are
considered ‘nominal’ and are for individual tests, unadjusted for
multiple comparisons because of the exploratory nature of this
study. Multivariate analyses were performed using multiple
regression to assess the associations between clinical and
laboratory variables that were found to be associated with markers
of coagulation and platelet activation (TAT, D-dimer, soluble
CD40 ligand and MPTF procoagulant activity) in univariate
analyses (P,0?15). Backwards elimination using Akaike’s Infor￾mation Criterion (AIC) was used to select the best model.
Statistical analyses were performed using R statistical software
(www.r-project.org).
Results
Demographic and Laboratory Characteristics
Sixty four patients with SCD (SS: 47; SC: 7; Sb0 thalassemia: 4;
Sb+ thalassemia: 5; and SD: 1) were evaluated. Due to the clinical
heterogeneity of SCD, the patients were arbitrarily categorized
into 2 groups based on presumed disease severity - SS/SD/Sb0
thalassemia and SC/Sb+ thalassemia. The demographic and
baseline laboratory characteristics of all the study subjects are
shown in Table 1. As expected, patients in the SS/SD/Sb0
thalassemia group had significantly lower hemoglobin values
(8.9 g/dL vs. 10.65 g/dL, p,0.0001), but higher platelet counts
(4126109
/L vs. 320.56109
/L; p = 0.0058), reticulocyte counts
(6.6% vs. 3.25%; p = 0.0011), total bilirubin (2.2 mg/dL vs.
0.95 mg/dL; p,0.0001), indirect bilirubin (2.11 mg/dL vs.
0.86 mg/dL; p,0.0001) and lactate dehydrogenase (894 U/L
vs. 641 U/L; p = 0.0011) than patients in the SC/Sb+ thalassemia
group. No significant differences were observed in the WBC count
or in the level of soluble VCAM-1 when patients in both groups
were compared.
Correlation of Markers of Coagulation and Platelet
Activation with Laboratory Variables
No significant differences in the levels of D-dimer (1424 ng/mL;
interquartile range [IQR], 745–2536 ng/mL vs. 1533.4 ng/mL;
IQR, 591–2006 ng/mL, p = 0.47), TAT (5.63 ng/L; IQR, 3.62–
8.9 ng/L vs. 4.86 ng/L; IQR, 3.91–6.19 ng/L, p = 0.59), soluble
CD40 ligand (0.453 ng/mL; IQR, 0.339–0.60 ng/mL vs.
0.409 ng/mL; IQR, 0.201–0.60 ng/mL, p = 0.24), and MPTF
procoagulant activity (0.145 pg/mL, IQR 0.094–0.265 pg/mL,
vs. 0.115 pg/mL, IQR 0.056–0.173 pg/mL, p = 0.17) were
observed when patients in the SS/SD/Sb0 thalassemia group
were compared with patients in the SC/Sb+ thalassemia group.
We observed a significant correlation between TAT and D-dimer
(r = 0.66; p,0.0001) (Figure 1). However, no correlations were
observed between TAT and soluble CD40 ligand (r = 0.016,
p = 0.91) or between TAT and MPTF procoagulant activity
(r = 0.064, p = 0.63). Similarly, no correlations were observed
between D-dimer and soluble CD40 ligand (r = 20.17; p = 0.19)

or between D-dimer and MPTF procoagulant activity (r = 0.11,
p = 0.40).
The plasma markers of coagulation activation, TAT and D￾dimer, were associated with laboratory measures of hemolysis
(Table 2). There was a correlation between TAT and lactate
dehydrogenase (r = 0.57, p,0.0001) (Figure 2), with borderline
correlations between TAT and total bilirubin (r = 0.25; p = 0.054),
indirect bilirubin (r = 0.26, p = 0.051), and hemoglobin (r = 20.24;
p = 0.071). TAT was also correlated with the absolute monocyte
count (r = 0.27; p = 0.035) and NT-proBNP (r = 0.35; p = 0.005).
Similarly, D-dimer was correlated with lactate dehydrogenase
(r = 0.56; p,0.0001) (Figure 3), indirect bilirubin (r = 0.26;
p = 0.048), hemoglobin (r = 20.32; p = 0.012), NT proBNP
(r = 0.42; p,0.0001), with borderline correlations with absolute
monocyte count (r = 0.23; p = 0.074). Both TAT (r = 0.37;
p = 0.004) and D-dimer (r = 0.49; p,0.0001) (Figure 4) were also
correlated with soluble VCAM-1.
Soluble CD40 ligand was correlated with WBC count (r = 0.30;
p = 0.018) and platelet count (r = 0.40; p = 0.0014), but was not
correlated with lactate dehydrogenase, total bilirubin, indirect
bilirubin or hemoglobin (Table 3). No correlations were observed
between MPTF procoagulant activity and measures of hemolysis
or other measured laboratory variables.
When the analyses were limited to only patients in the SS/SD/Sb0
thalassemia group, there was a significant correlation between TAT
and lactate dehydrogenase (r = 0.62, p,0.0001), indirect bilirubin
(r = 0.296, p = 0.044), and NT-proBNP (r = 0.32, p = 0.026), with
borderline correlation with total bilirubin (r = 0.28, p = 0.053) and
absolute monocyte count (r = 0.25, p = 0.089). Similarly, we observed
significant correlations between D-dimer and lactate dehydrogenase
(r = 0.60, p,0.0001), hemoglobin (r = 20.29, p = 0.039), fetal
hemoglobin (r = 20.31, p = 0.035), and NT-proBNP (r = 0.49,
p,0.0001), with borderline correlations with platelet count
(r = 20.28, p = 0.053), total bilirubin (r = 0.24, p = 0.093) and indirect
bilirubin (r = 0.26, p = 0.07). Soluble CD40 ligand was correlated

(r = 0.31, p = 0.034), but not correlated with measures of hemolysis or

Association of Measures of Coagulation and Platelet
Activation with Clinical Complications. The level of TAT
was significantly higher in patients with a history of retinopathy
compared to those without this complication (6.05 ng/L; IQR,
4.91, 10.98 ng/L vs. 4.52 ng/L; IQR, 3.22, 7.33 ng/L, p = 0.023)
(Table 4). In addition, the level of TAT was lower in patients on
hydroxyurea therapy compared to those not on such therapy
(4.39 ng/L; IQR, 3.25, 8.77 ng/L vs. 6.5 ng/L; IQR, 5.08,
8.76 ng/L, p = 0.044). D-dimer appeared to be associated with a
history of stroke (3003.1 ng/mL [FEU]; IQR, 1513, 3067 ng/mL
[FEU] vs. 1399.5 ng/mL [FEU]; 648.8, 2217 ng/mL [FEU],
p = 0.062), although the difference was not statistically significant.
When those patients with a measurable tricuspid regurgitant jet
velocity were evaluated (N = 43), there was no correlation between
D-dimer and tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity (r = 0.25, p = 0.10).
There was an association between MPTF procoagulant activity
and a history of acute chest syndrome (0.1445 pg/mL; IQR, 0.11,
0.268 pg/mL vs. 0.07 pg/mL; IQR, 0, 0.149 pg/mL, p = 0.045)
(Table 5). Finally, soluble CD40 ligand appeared to be associated
with the frequency of pain episodes (,3 episodes vs. $3 episodes
in the past year: 0.406 ng/mL; IQR, 0.428, 0.677 ng/mL vs.

4.465 ng/L; IQR 3.215, 7.332, p = 0.018), and soluble CD40
ligand and frequency of pain episodes (,3 episodes vs. $3
episodes in the past year: 0.398 ng/mL; IQR 0.308, 0.568 ng/mL
vs. 0.543 ng/mL; IQR 0.434, 0.730 ng/mL, p = 0.039), but the
previously observed association between MPTF procoagulant
activity and acute chest syndrome was no longer significant
(0.148 pg/mL; IQR 0.115, 0.274 pg/mL vs. 0.094 pg/mL; IQR
0.047, 0.155 pg/mL, p = 0.32). There appeared to be a correla￾tion between tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity and D-dimer
(r = 0.3, p = 0.067), although this was not statistically significant.
Multivariate Analyses
Clinical and laboratory variables were selected for use in the
multivariate model via a backwards elimination procedure using
AIC as the fit criterion. The clinical variables were history of
stroke, retinopathy, avascular necrosis, history of leg ulcers, and
history of acute chest syndrome. The laboratory variables were
lactate dehydrogenase, hemoglobin, reticulocyte count, white
blood cell count, absolute neutrophil count, platelet count, total
bilirubin, direct bilirubin, and NT-proBNP (Table 6). In this
multivariate model, D-Dimer was associated with reticulocyte
count (estimate: 92.56, p = 0.04), lactate dehydrogenase (estimate:
1.22, p = 0.0002), NT-proBNP (estimate: 0.44, p,0.0001) and
history of stroke (estimate: 984.01, p = 0.051). This means that for
continuous variables such as lactate dehydrogenase, we expect an
increase in D-dimer by 1.22 units for every 1 unit increase in
lactate dehydrogenase. For binary responses such as history of
stroke, the estimated value of 984.01 indicates that having a
history of stroke is predicted to result in an increase in D-dimer of
984.01 ng/mL [FEU] compared to no history of stroke. Soluble
CD40 ligand was associated with WBC count (estimate: 0.04,
p = 0.05), and platelet count (estimate: 0.001, p = 0.0016). Finally,
MPTF procoagulant activity was associated with hemoglobin
(estimate: 0.024, p = 0.023), and history of acute chest syndrome
(estimate: 0.103, p = 0.029).
Discussion
Although SCD is characterized by hypercoagulability [1,4], the
contribution of coagulation and platelet activation to disease
pathophysiology remains poorly defined. Plasma levels of TAT,
prothrombin fragment 1.2 and D-dimer are increased in patients
with SCD during the non-crisis, ‘‘steady state’’ and are further
increased during acute pain episodes [16]. D-dimer levels are
reported to correlate with the frequency of pain episodes measured
during the following year [16] as well as the interval for
development of pain episodes, suggesting that coagulation
activation may contribute to vaso-occlusion in SCD. Platelets
are also activated in SCD during the non-crisis, ‘‘steady state,’’
with further activation during acute pain episodes [7,16]. In
addition, platelet activation, marked by activated fibrinogen
receptor, has been reported to correlate with echocardiography￾derived tricuspid jet regurgitant velocity suggesting an association
with pulmonary hypertension in SCD [17].
In our present cross-sectional study, we observed no differences
in markers of coagulation and platelet activation when patients in
the SS/SD/Sb0 thalassemia group were compared to patients in
the SC/Sb+ thalassemia group. Patients with sickle cell anemia
(HbSS) have previously been reported to have higher plasma levels
of markers of coagulation activation compared to patients with
HbSC disease [18]. The reason for the absence of a difference
between the groups in our study is uncertain, but may be related to
the arbitrary grouping of the various genotypes based on the

presumed severity of disease. Furthermore, as patients with more
‘‘severe’’ genotypes are more likely to be treated with hydroxy￾urea, it is possible that the lack of a difference may be due to a
decrease in disease severity following hydroxyurea therapy. This
presumption is supported by our finding of an association between
TAT and hydroxyurea use on univariate analysis. In addition,
hydroxyurea has previously been reported to decrease D-dimer
levels in patients with SCD [19], suggesting that this drug may
decrease the coagulation activation observed in SCD.
As expected, we observed significant correlations between TAT
and D-dimer. This is consistent with previous reports in SCD [16].
Similar to previous publications by our group and others [15,20],
our finding of correlations between both TAT and D-dimer with
measures of hemolysis extends and confirms the contribution of
hemolysis to coagulation activation in SCD. Heme, an inflamma￾tory mediator and a product of hemolysis, has been shown to
induce TF expression on the surface of both macrovascular and
microvascular endothelial cells in a concentration-dependent
manner [21]. In addition, heme produces an upregulation of the
expression of TF mRNA, TF protein, and TF procoagulant
activity in endothelial cells in a time-dependent manner, effects
that may be mediated, at least in part, by the transcription factor,
NFkappaB. Thus, heme-induced endothelial TF expression may
provide a pathophysiologic link between hemolysis and the
coagulation activation in SCD. Unlike a previous report that
suggested an association between hemolysis and platelet activation
[17], no correlation was observed between soluble CD40 ligand
and measures of hemolysis in our study. Surprisingly, no
correlations were observed between the measured plasma markers
of coagulation activation (TAT and D-dimer) with either soluble
CD40 ligand or MPTF procoagulant activity in our study. As
CD40 ligand is known to induce the expression of TF in SCD [7],
the reason for the lack of association between the plasma markers
of coagulation activation and soluble CD40 ligand is uncertain.
Furthermore, although MPTF procoagulant activity has previous￾ly been reported to correlate with plasma markers of coagulation
activation in SCD [22], a recent report showed that while whole
blood TF procoagulant activity was correlated with TAT, D￾dimer, as well as markers of hemolysis, inflammation and
endothelial activation, no such correlations were observed between
MPTF procoagulant activity and any of these markers [23]. As a
result, the contribution of MPTF procoagulant activity to
coagulation activation in SCD remains uncertain.
The correlation of both TAT and D-dimer with soluble VCAM-1
suggests a relationship between activation of the coagulation system
and endothelial activation in SCD. Furthermore, the correlation of
TAT (and possibly D-dimer) with the absolute monocyte count
suggests that monocytes may play a role in the coagulation
activation in SCD. Monocytes are activated [24], abnormally
express TF [5] and are a source of TF-positive microparticles [22] in
SCD. There is increasing evidence of a crosstalk between
coagulation activation and inflammation [25]. SCD is often referred
to as a chronic inflammatory disease [26,27] and circulating
endothelial cells in SCD patients are reported to express TF [28].
While the observed association between plasma markers of
coagulation activation and measures of inflammation in our study
does not prove causality, the inflammatory state in SCD may indeed
contribute to hypercoagulability in SCD. Studies in transgenic SCD
mice demonstrate that the induction of ischemia-reperfusion injury
by exposure of the mild sickle-cell phenotype, NY1DD mice, to a
hypoxic environment followed by a return to ambient air resulted in
increased TF expression in the pulmonary veins [29].
The association between D-dimer and a history of stroke suggests
that coagulation activation may contribute to the pathogenesis of
stroke in SCD. Although the pathophysiology of stroke in SCD is
complex, large vessel arterial obstruction with superimposed
thrombosis is commonly observed in patients with thrombotic stroke
[30]. Despite the absence of a significant association between
coagulation activation and echocardiography-derived tricuspid
regurgitant jet velocity in our study, autopsy series show the presence
of in situ thrombosis in the pulmonary vasculature of patients with
SCD-related pulmonary hypertension [31]. A recent study evaluating
the relative role played by cells and plasma in the hypercoagulability
observed in b thalassemia patients showed evidence of hypercoag￾ulability based on thromboelastometry evaluation, but thrombin
generation determined in platelet-poor plasma was not significantly
different from healthy individuals [32]. With the known contribution
of red blood cells and other cellular elements to hypercoagulability in
SCD, this finding suggests that much like in b thalassemia, evaluation
of whole blood may be required to accurately demonstrate
associations between coagulation activation and clinical complica￾tions in SCD. The absence of an association between coagulation
activation and echocardiography-derived tricuspid regurgitant jet
velocity in our study may also reflect the small number of patients
with catheterization-proven pulmonary hypertension in our cohort.
Indeed, a recent multicenter study found no evidence of pulmonary
hypertension following right heart catheterization in 72 of 96 patients
with elevated tricuspid regurgitant jet velocities on echocardiography,
suggesting that Doppler echocardiography may overestimate the
prevalence of this condition [33].
The association between soluble CD40 ligand and the
frequency of pain episodes in the past year in the SS/SD/Sb0
thalassemia group suggests that platelet activation may contribute
to the pathogenesis of acute pain episodes in SCD. This finding is
consistent with a previous report showing a correlation between
platelet procoagulant activity assessed by annexin V binding and
the frequency of pain episodes measured during the following year
[16]. Platelet-derived CD40 ligand has been shown to induce
tissue factor expression, endothelial cell expression of ICAM-1 and
B-cell proliferation in SCD [7] and as such may play a role in
disease pathophysiology.
Our study has several limitations. The patients were recruited
from a specialty clinic at a tertiary care medical center, and may not
represent all patients with SCD. The study population is relatively
small, while the number of comparisons made is relatively large. We
have reported only nominal p-values for each statistical test, with no
adjustment made for multiple comparisons, reflecting the explor￾atory nature of this study. As with all cross-sectional studies, this
analysis demonstrates associations, but cannot prove causation.
In summary, our study supports and extends the association of
coagulation activation with hemolysis in SCD. TAT was associated
with D-dimer, but these markers of coagulation activation were not
associated with soluble CD40 ligand or MPTF procoagulant activity.
We also show that D-dimer is associated with a history of stroke in
patients with clinically severe forms of SCD. More research is needed
to evaluate the pathophysiology of coagulation and platelet activation
and their contribution to clinical complications in SCD.
