Hepatitis syndrome in infancy-an epidemiological
survey with 10 year follow up
M C DICK AND A P MOWAT

SUMMARY Fifty four infants with hepatobiliary disease and conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia of
more than two weeks' duration were identified in a defined area of south east England in a
prospective study between January 1971 and December 1973. The overall incidence was one case
per 2500 live births. The cases were regularly reviewed and all survivors except one were assessed
at age 10 years.
Nine of 11 with extrahepatic biliary atresia died from liver disease by 2 years of age, one died at
5 years, and the survivor has cirrhosis with portal hypertension. Four out of seven with a1
antitrypsin deficiency died aged 1 to 3 years from liver disease and one of the survivors has
cirrhosis. All three infants with intrauterine infection and one with chromosomal abnormality
died in infancy. Three children with other associated factors, choledochal cyst, galactosaemia,
and rhesus isoimmunisation, recovered completely with no persisting liver disease. Two of 29
with cryptogenic hepatitis died, but only a further two have signs of persisting liver disease.
Perinatal complications were more common in this group. Four of the 27 children surviving to the
age of 10 years are educationally subnormal. Prognosis for infants with intrahepatic liver disease
in the absence of known associated factors is good and every effort should be made to minimise
the short term effects of cholestasis.
An increasing number of structural abnormalities,
metabolic factors, and infective agents have been
recognised in association with hepatobiliary dis￾orders in early infancy.' 2 These factors clearly
influence the prognosis for affected infants. The
incidence of persisting hepatic abnormalities re￾ported in children in whom no associated features
were found is controversial ranging from 10 of 70
patients in Odievre's series3 to 21 of 59 in Danks'
series.4 Such variation in outcome may be due to
case selection, referral patterns, and completeness
of follow up.
To assess the relative incidence of the various
causes and factors associated with hepatobiliary
disease in infancy and their influence on the long
term prognosis, a prospective study of all such
infants in a defined area of south east England was
carried out between January 1971 and December
1973.5 The cases identified have been regularly
reassessed up to the age of 10 years.
Patients and methods
The area studied was a NHS administrative region
in south east England approximately 70 miles long
and 50 miles wide. It includes a quadrant of inner
London, the predominantly industrial southern
shore of the Thames estuary, and a largely agricul￾tural area extending down to the south east coast.
The total population is approximately 3½/2 million,
with 134 000 births during the three year period of
the study. Criteria for inclusion in the study were (1)
conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia lasting for more
than two weeks in the first four months of life and
(2) biochemical features of hepatocellular necrosis.
The latter were confirmed by percutaneous liver
biopsy performed in 90% of cases.
All 16 paediatric units in the region cooperated in
the study by identifying and notifying cases. To
ensure complete reporting, all units were visited and
staff interviewed regularly. The paediatricians were

informed of the progress of the study by letters and
clinical meetings. Forty per cent of patients were
fully investigated in the peripheral paediatric unit,
clinical responsibility being retained by the local
consultant.
Appropriate samples for viral and bacterial causes
of the syndrome, a1 antitrypsin phenotype, galacto￾suria, and serum and urinary amino acids were
taken in all patients. Where indicated chromosomal
analysis, sweat electrolytes, and ''131Rose-Bengal
faecal excretion were performed. Extrahepatic bili￾ary atresia was confirmed at laporotomy. Patency of
the extrahepatic biliary system in other patients was
confirmed by subsequent clearing of the jaundice in
all but two. One of these had operative cholan￾giography and in the other patient extrahepatic bile
ducts were found at necropsy.
The frequency of clinical assessment with bio￾chemical tests of liver function using standard
laboratory methods was determined by the condi￾tion of the patient but occurred in all cases at 1, 3, 5,
and 10 years of age. Follow up liver biopsies were
only carried out in those children in whom there was
clinical or biochemical evidence of continuing liver
disease.
Results
The number of cases reported in each of the three
years was 19, 20, and 15 giving an overall incidence
of 1 case per 2500 live births. Details of diagnostic
categories are given in Table 1. The three with
intrauterine infection had cytomegalovirus, rubella,
and toxoplasmosis, the latter infant also having
Down's syndrome. For 29 of the 54 cases no cause or
associated disorder was found, giving an incidence
of idiopathic 'hepatitis' of 1 per 4800 live births.
Two girls with idiopathic hepatitis each have one
sibling who also had hepatitis in infancy-one an
affected brother, the other an affected sister. There
was no parental consanguinity. None of the parents

were reported as having had hepatitis in infancy,
although in 15 out of 54 families there was a history
suggestive of acute viral hepatitis in one or both
parents many years before.
The total series included 31 boys and 23 girls. The
ratio in extrahepatic biliary atresia was eight boys to
three girls; in a1 antitrypsin deficiency, four boys to
three girls; and in idiopathic hepatitis 17 boys to 12
girls.
Previous obstetric difficulties were more common
in the mothers of those with idiopathic disease, five
having had previous miscarriages or stillbirths and
three having had terminations. There was one
previous stillbirth in a mother of an infant with
biliary atresia.
Preterm deliveries (five infants) and infants small
for gestational age (11 infants) were common in the
idiopathic group. Perinatal problems such as res￾piratory distress, hypoglycaemia, and convulsions
occurred in 10 of the idiopathic group. There were
no cases of preterm deliveries or infants light for
gestational age in either the biliary atresia or the a1
antitrypsin deficient groups. All the infants with
intrauterine infections and chromosomal abnor￾mality were light for gestational age.
Ventricular septal defect occurred in one infant
with biliary atresia and one child with idiopathic
hepatitis. Dextrocardia and pulmonary stenosis
were detected in one other infant with biliary
atresia, and congenital heart block in one infant with
idiopathic hepatitis.
Bacterial infections occurred in all diagnostic
categories. Three infants, including one with
cytomegalovirus infection, had septicaemia, nine
had a urinary tract infection, and nine had signs
suggestive of infection which improved on antibiotic
treatment, although bacteriological investigations
were negative. In neither of these categories did
antibiotic treatment clearly improve liver function.
Pathogens were isolated in specimens from 13 other
patients but none of these had symptoms or signs of
infection. It is not known whether infection was
causal or coincidental in any of these.
Outcome (Table 2).
Extrahepatic biliary atresia
Nine of the 11 cases died by 2 years of age after
surgery had been ineffective. None had undergone
portoenterostomy. One survived with partial bile
drainage until 5 years of age. The sole survivor is
aged 11 years and is leading a normal life, although
mildly jaundiced with gross splenomegaly and
abnormal liver function tests. He had an oeso￾phageal resection for repeated haematemeses due to
varices in 1976, and in 1984 required injection of
varices because of recurrent bleeding.

Four of the seven cases have died aged between 1
and 3 years, all with cirrhosis at death. Of the three
surviving, one has cirrhosis, one has no clinical or
biochemical evidence of liver disease, and the other
is alive and well but is the only patient not seen at
age 10 years. At 5 years he had marginally raised
gammaglutamyl transferase activity but no other
signs of liver disease.
Miscellaneous causes
The three patients with intrauterine infection and
one with chromosomal abnormality all died during
the first three months of life with other organs
affected as well as the liver. The children with
galactosaemia, choledochal cyst, and rhesus disease
are all well with no biochemical signs of liver
disease.
Idiopathic hepatitis
Two children have died in this group. Both were
jaundiced with acholic stools which persisted until
death at the age of 4 and 5 months respectively.
One, who had no necropsy examination, had
undergone a laporotomy at 5 weeks of age to
exclude extrahepatic biliary atresia. The cause of
death in this infant is uncertain. In the other infant
necropsy showed pneumonia.
The duration of jaundice varied from two to 26
weeks with a mean and median of 10 weeks. Twelve
had acholic stools but these persisted for over a
month in only four patients. The two infants who
died had acholic stools for more than one month but
in other respects, such as presenting features and
biochemical tests, did not differ from the remainder
of the idiopathic group or from the others with
acholic stools of more than one month's duration.
In the 27 survivors, jaundice gradually subsided
by 1 year of age. At 1 year, two had hepatomegaly,
six splenomegaly, and 12 still had a raised aspartate
aminotransferase activity (greater than 40 IU/l),
four of these being twice the upper limit of normal.
At 3 years, two had hepatomegaly and one had
splenomegaly, all three having raised aspartate
aminotransferase activity. Two others were below
the third centile for both height and weight but these
and the remainder had no clinical or biochemical
features of liver disease.
At 5 years one had hepatomegaly, one had
hepatosplenomegaly with raised aspartate amino￾transferase, and one other had raised aspartate
aminotransferase activity.
At 10 years one has hepatosplenomegaly and
cirrhosis on liver biopsy and one has hepatomegaly,
but none have abnormal biochemical tests of liver
function. Repeat liver biopsies have been performed
in five, two of whom had an affected sibling, the
others having features of liver disease at 3 and 5
years of age. A liver biopsy at 8 weeks of age from
one of those with an affected sibling showed severe
cholestasis with moderate portal tract fibrosis and
inflammatory cell infiltrate in the portal tract and
hepatic parenchyma, with piecemeal necrosis. This
persisted in repeat biopsies at 2 and 6 years of age,
the most recent showing established post necrotic
cirrhosis. The initial biopsies of the other girl with
an affected sibling and the other three children were
essentially similar to the above except two showed
prominent giant cell transformation of hepatocytes,
but the portal tract fibrosis was mild in all. Repeat
liver biopsies at 8, 11, 11, and 12 years respectively
showed no evidence of cholestasis, hepatocellular
necrosis, or cellular infiltrate but all showed persist￾ing mild increase in fibrosis both intralobularly and
in the portal tract. The severity of liver disease in
infancy in the two patients with persisting hepatic
abnormalities when compared with the 25 who
recovered completely was similar, as assessed by the
duration of jaundice, period of acholic stools, and
the degree of abnormality of biochemical tests of
liver function. The initial biopsy in one of those with
persisting liver disease had, as detailed above,
increased fibrosis but in the other findings were
similar to those who recovered completely.

Four of the 25 without liver disease, attend
schools for the educationally subnormal. Two of
these were light for gestational age and one was
diagnosed as having congenital hypothyroidism at 6
months of age. One child is below the third centile
for both weight and height and one is below the
third centile for weight only. Both were light for
gestational age. The remaining children are nor￾mally grown and leading normal lives.
Discussion
The stimulus to undertake this study was the
observation that children referred with chronic liver
disease have frequently presented in early infancy
with jaundice associated with some form of 'hepa￾titis syndrome'. The frequency of this liver disease in
infancy is clearly dependent on the criteria used in
identifying these patients, modes of case ascertain￾ment, and referral patterns as well as the frequency
of genetic or environmental causes in the commun￾ity studied. By including only infants who have had
conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia for at least two
weeks we hoped to identify infants who should be
referred and who might develop chronic liver disease.
Infants with transient cholestasis associated with
treatable bacterial infections or metabolic disorders
such as galactosaemia, which had been effectively
treated would not necessarily have been included.
The incidence of this disorder, 1 per 2500 live births,
must be considered in respect of these criteria.
Incidence figures quoted in other studies1 2 6 have
ranged from 1 in 500 in the UKto 1 in 9000 in Norway.
In the former study duration of jaundice was not
indicated, so possibly included transient mild cases,
while the latter was limited to infants with persistent
complete cholestasis who were referred for con￾sideration of biliary atresia.
Infective, genetic, and structural factors associ￾ated with hepatobiliary disease were identified in
25% of the cases in this series. The cause of liver
disease in most is largely unexplained. Impaired
blood supply to the biliary system7 may be one
factor which initiates the inflammatory destruction
of bile ducts in biliary atresia. Reovirus infection8
has been implicated in both intrahepatic and biliary
disease. An increasing number of metabolic dis￾orders and infective agents have been associated
with liver disease but the mechanism of liver injury
is uncertain. This is so even where the association
with liver disease is strong as in a, antitrypsin defi￾ciency in which only 50% have abnormal liver function
as infants and only 10% have clinically evident liver
disease.9 10
The high incidence of obstetric problems, in￾trauterine growth retardation, and perinatal difficul￾ties in those with idiopathic disease is striking, but
whether the liver damage had the same primary
cause or was a sequel to these problems could not be
determined. Only two sibships with affected infants
were identified in contrast to Danks' and Henrik￾sen's series where familial occurrence was much
higher.1 2 A high incidence of bacterial infection was
observed in all diagnostic categories. It was imposs￾ible to ascertain whether the infection was causal,
opportunistic, or coincidental. Unexpectedly, there
was a high mortality in infants with systemic viral
infection in contrast with the more favourable
outcome in 22 infants reported by Danks, of whom
only five died and three survivors had abnormal
liver function.4 The dismal prognosis for infants with
extrahepatic biliary atresia before the introduction
of successful portoenterostomy" is reflected in this
series, with only one of 11 surviving. Currently, with
an experienced surgeon, over 70% of those oper￾ated on by 50 days of age may be expected to
become jaundice free, and survival with a good
quality of life into the third decade of life hias been
recorded. 12
The high mortality in early childhood seen in the
seven patients with a1 antitrypsin deficiency is
greater than that reported in the only other
epidemiological study in which only three of 14 with
prolonged neonatal cholestasis developed cirrhosis.9
In that study, however, liver biopsy was not used to
assess the severity of liver disease and the incidence
of cirrhosis may be underestimated. In two large
series of cases presenting with jaundice in infancy,
25% had already died from cirrhosis by the age of 17
years, a further 25% had cirrhosis, while approxi￾mately 30% had persisting liver disease.13 1
The prognosis of infants with cryptogenic in￾trahepatic disease has been encouragingly good with
only two deaths and two with signs of persisting liver
disease. A similarly low incidence of persistent
abnormality has been reported in Japan,15 but other
groups have reported more severe disease.24 In
these series not only did intrahepatic disease carry a
worse prognosis but those who also had a family
history of the syndrome fared badly. In our series
one of two infants from families with a positive
history developed cirrhosis. It seems likely that the
familial cases may be attributable to some unrecog￾nised genetic or metabolic factor. No infants with
intrahepatic bile duct hypoplasia, a cause of chronic
liver disease, were identified, although possibly the
two infants who died might ultimately have de￾veloped features of this disorder.
The prognosis in this series did not seem to be
related to the duration or intensity of jaundice or the
presence of acholic stools. Nor did it seem related to

the nature of the histological change in the early
liver biopsy.
The possible deleterious effect of laparotomy on
the long term prognosis of cholestatic liver disease in
infants remains controversial3 16-18 and whether it
contributed to the death of one of the two infants
with intrahepatic disease in this series is uncertain.
Laporotomy is now rarely required for diagnosis,
which is fortunate, as the findings at laporotomy
may be difficult to interpret'9 and inappropriate
destructive surgery undertaken.20
None of the survivors in this series has sympto￾matic liver disease, although one has inactive
cirrhosis on liver biopsy. Sixteen per cent have
intellectual retardation, possibly related to perinatal
problems. Of these, one child had congenital
hypothyroidism. At the time of the study the
association of hypothyroidism with conjugated
hyperbilirubinaemia had not been recognised. The
prognosis therefore for intrahepatic liver disease in
the absence of known genetic, infectious, or struc￾tural factors or a positive family history is good and
every effort should be made to minimise the short
term effects of cholestasis with fat soluble vitamins
and dietary supplements, and identify and amelio￾rate associated problems such as intellectual re￾tardation.
