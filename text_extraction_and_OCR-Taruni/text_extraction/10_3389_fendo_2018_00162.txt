Objective: Osteoporosis and fragility fractures represent serious complications for the 
solid organ transplant population. The recommended osteoporosis therapy for organ 
recipients involves supplementation with calcium and vitamin D and bisphosphonate 
administration. However, these options can prove limited for patients with impaired renal 
function. An alternative therapy option is offered by denosumab, a monoclonal antibody 
that targets receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand.
Patients and methods: We evaluated 63 patients with osteoporosis (23 males and 40 
females, age 56.4 ± 13.1 years) following solid organ transplantation (15 diabetic patients 
after simultaneous transplantation of the kidney and pancreas, 34 patients after kidney 
transplantation, and 14 patients with liver grafts). Osteoporosis was diagnosed accord￾ing to standard DEXA examination using the Lunar Prodigy apparatus. Transplanted 
patients with impaired renal function were treated for osteoporosis of the lumbar spine 
(L-spine) and/or proximal femur with calcium and vitamin D supplementation and 60 mg 
of denosumab every 6 months between the years 2012 and 2017. The mean duration 
of the therapy was 1.65 ± 0.7 years.
Results: After denosumab therapy, L-spine T-scores improved across the whole group, 
ranging from −2.7 ± 0.09 to −1.8 ± 1.0 (p < 0.001). T-score values for the proximal 
femur increased from −2.5 ± 0.8 to −2.0 ± 0.7 after the therapy (p < 0.01). We observed 
only a mild, statistically insignificant improvement in distal forearm T-scores. The mean 
increase in L-spine bone mineral density (BMD) was 11.5 ± 6.2% in subjects with oste￾oporosis at this site and 10.4 ± 6.1% in the case of all patients. BMD of the proximal 
femur increased by 10.4 ± 8.3% in patients with osteoporosis and by 7.5 ± 7.3% in all 
patients. Denosumab therapy decreased the prevalence of osteoporosis in the L-spine 
from 75 to 27% (p < 0.001) and proximal femur osteoporosis from 54 to 36% (p < 0.05). 
Denosumab therapy reduced elevated levels of osteocalcin and beta-crosslaps (βCTX) 
in comparison with baseline levels (p < 0.001) across the whole group of graft recipients.
Conclusion: Denosumab therapy was well-tolerated and improved bone density in our 
group of solid organ transplant recipients. The indications are that denosumab could 
be a viable therapeutic option for transplanted patients with osteoporosis, especially in 
those with renal function impairment or bisphosphonate intolerance.

INTRODUCTION
Osteoporosis is among the complications that have become 
more prevalent with the increased survival of patients after 
solid organ transplantation (Tx). The main consequence of 
osteoporosis is bone fracture, which is associated with increased 
morbidity and mortality rates. The pathogenesis of transplant￾associated osteoporosis is multifactorial and involves altered 
bone metabolism during the pre-transplant period, posttrans￾plant bone loss caused by immunosuppressive therapy and 
corticosteroids, persistent hyperparathyroidism (in renal graft 
recipients), and vitamin D deficiency (1). Currently used immu￾nosuppressive agents have yielded favorable survival outcomes. 
However, the common complications of immunosuppressive 
therapy include the following: infections, malignancies, kidney 
damage, and skeletal impairment with increased risk of bone 
fracture (2–4). Posttransplantation bone loss is greatest in the 
first 6–12  months and, according to some studies, incidence 
of fractures can exceed 40% (5). The use of glucocorticoids, 
especially at high doses during the early posttransplant period, 
leads to a decrease in bone density, early osteoblast apoptosis, 
a reduction in the bone formation rate, and prolonged miner￾alization lag time (6, 7). Bone disease after liver transplantation 
can cause high incidence of skeletal fractures, ranging from 24 
to 65% depending on the series (8). In the later posttransplant 
period, bone mineral density (BMD) can stabilize or even 
improve depending on allograft function (9). However, further 
bone loss is associated with persistent hyperparathyroidism, 
which mainly occurs in kidney graft recipients (10), vitamin 
D deficiency, rejection episodes, and persistent impairment of 
graft function (11, 12). The recommended osteoporosis therapy 
for organ recipients involves supplementation with calcium 
and vitamin D and administration of bisphosphonates (2, 
13). Unfortunately, one limitation of bisphosphonate therapy 
is that it can impair renal function, which is frequent during 
the posttransplant period. A possible solution is treatment 
with denosumab, a monoclonal antibody that targets receptor 
activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL). The aim 
of our study was to provide data on the efficacy of denosumab 
treatment in subjects after solid organ transplantation and to 
redress the scarcity of investigative data on its use in these 
subjects thus far (14, 15).
PATIENTS AND METHODS
In this retrospective study, we evaluated 63 patients (23 males and 
40 females, aged 56.5 ± 13.1 years) after solid organ transplanta￾tion. The patients were treated for osteoporosis with 60  mg of 
denosumab every 6  months between the years 2012 and 2017. 
The period of time since previous transplantations ranged 
between 0 and 24 years (mean 6.4 ± 6.3 years) upon beginning 
denosumab therapy. Fifteen diabetic patients underwent simul￾taneous transplantation of the kidney and pancreas, 34 patients 
underwent kidney transplantation, and 14 patients underwent 
liver transplantation. All patients were treated with immunosup￾pressive agents, including a calcineurin antagonist, mycophe￾nolate mofetil, sirolimus, and glucocorticoids in various doses 
following the transplantation. A recommended daily corticoid 
dose of 2.5–10 mg of prednisone was administered as a treatment 
for 39/63 (62%) patients at the time of introducing denosumab 
therapy. The average prednisone dose was 5 mg/day in the case of 
26/39 treated subjects.
Osteoporosis was confirmed by standard dual energy X-ray 
absorptiometry (DXA) examination using the same device 
and software (Lunar Prodigy Primo, GE Healthcare Lunar, 
Madison, WI, USA) over the whole study period. Instrument 
quality control on the DXA scanner was performed by daily 
scanning of a spine phantom (QA Phantom BMD 1.002 g/cm2
, 
BMC 25.07 g, area 25.01 cm2
) as a routine procedure, with an 
absence of machine drift throughout the study and with a BMD 
coefficient variation of 0.31–0.32%. Scan time and radiation 
dosage were as follows: AP lumbar spine (L-spine): 60  s and 
42 μGy; proximal femur: 60  s and 42 μGy. The coefficients of 
variation for BMD measurements were 1% for the L spine and, 
again, 1% for the proximal femur. The results were expressed 
as T-scores (the SD from the mean BMD for a young healthy 
population) in accordance with World Health Organization 
criteria for the definition of osteoporosis (T score ≤ −2.5 SD) 
and osteopenia (T score < −1 and > −2.5 SD). BMD evaluation 
by DXA examination was performed for all treated patients in 
12-month intervals.
History of osteoporotic fractures applied to 26/63 (41.3%) 
graft recipients. Vertebral fractures were recorded in 3 patients, 
hip fractures in 6 patients, and rib fractures in 3 patients, while 
5 patients had history of pelvic fracture. Peripheral fractures 
(ankle, foot, and forearm) applied to 12 patients, while 3 patients 
suffered from multiple fractures (both central and peripheral). 
Seventeen fractures had occurred before denosumab therapy 
and 12 fractures during treatment, most of which were non￾vertebral (11/12). Seven patients had peripheral fractures, two 
had hip fractures, one had a pelvic fracture, and another a rib 
fracture.
The criterion for the introduction of denosumab therapy was 
the presence of low BMD values with a T-score ≤ −2.5 SD at 
the site of the L-spine or total proximal femur, thereby impairing 
renal function and preventing the administration of bisphospho￾nates. Patients with severe graft function impairment (CKD G5) 
were not considered for denosumab therapy due to the risk of 
severe hypocalcemia. Denosumab injections were administrated 
in 6-month intervals to all patients; the minimum treatment 
duration was 1  year, while the mean duration of therapy was 
1.65 ± 0.7 years. Calcium and vitamin D supplementation com￾prised an essential part of all patients’ regimes both before and 
during therapy with denosumab. Calcium was administered in a 
daily dose of 500–1,000 mg and vitamin D orally in a daily dose 
of 800–1,000  IU, eventually in combination with 1,25(OH)2D3
(0.25–0.50 μg/day). Calcitriol was added to the regime in the case 
of 28/63 (44%) subjects, while 13/63 (21%) patients were treated 
with paricalcitol.
Laboratory Measurements
Demographic and clinical data were obtained from charts and 
records at the beginning and at the end of denosumab therapy as 
well as during the year 2017. Blood samples were taken according

to standard clinical praxis after overnight fasting. Biochemical 
tests were measured before denosumab therapy and at the end of 
treatment. In patients who were still using denosumab in 2017, 
tests were carried out after the final injection.
Retrospective analysis of biochemical results was performed 
as follows: Total serum calcium (s-Ca) (normal values 2.15–
2.55 mmol/L) and creatinine (normal values 49–90 µmol/L) were 
analyzed spectrophotometrically using automated analyzers. 
Kidney function was determined by measuring serum creatinine 
and estimated GF as CKD-EPI values. Estimated GF was calcu￾lated according to the CKD-EPI formula (16). Intact parathyroid 
hormone (PTH) (normal values 1.6–6.9 pmol/L) was analyzed by 
electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. Osteocalcin (normal 
values 15–46  µg/L) and beta-crosslaps (βCTX) (normal values 
0.330–0.782  µg/L) were also analyzed by electrochemilumi￾nescence immunoassay using the Cobas e 801 analyzer (Roche 
Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim). Normal values for biochemical 
variables were taken from those indicated by the kit manufac￾turers. Vitamin D concentration was applicable for 46 patients, 
with calcitriol concentration applicable for 33 patients. 25-OH 
vitamin D (normal values 23–113  nmol/L or 9.2–45.2  µg/L) 
and the active metabolite 1,25-OH vitamin D -1,25(OH)2D3
(1,25-OH-vitamin D; calcitriol) (normal values 47–130 pmol/L 
or 19.6–54.3 ng/L) were measured by the RIA method (kits from 
DIAsource ImmunoAssays S.A., Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium and 
Immunodiagnostic Systems, Boldon, UK).
The results of serum 25-OHD3 were classified according to the 
Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (K/DOQI) clinical 
practice guidelines for bone metabolism and chronic kidney 
disease. Therefore, vitamin D deficiency was defined as a serum 
level <40 nmol/L (<16 μg/L), with insufficiency between 40 and 
75 nmol/L (16–30 µg/L) (13).
Statistical Analysis
Results were analyzed using JMP statistical software. Continuous 
variables displaying normal distribution are expressed as 
mean ± SD, with others as median and range. Categorical vari￾ables are described based on absolute and relative frequencies. 
For before and after comparisons, the paired t-test or one-sample 
Wilcoxon signed rank test was used based on data distribution 
for continuous variables. For discrete variables, McNemar’s test 
was applied. A two-tailed p-value of less than 0.05 was considered 
statistically significant.
RESULTS
The laboratory data of patients at baseline and after treatment 
are summarized in Table  1. Graft recipients in all groups had 
increased levels of creatinine and PTH, neither of which differed 
before or after denosumab therapy. The creatinine level was low￾est in patients after liver Tx but the difference was not significant. 
The median estimated glomerular filtration rate measured in 
all patients at the beginning of the therapy [0.55 mL/s/1.73 m2
(95% CI 0.48–0.61)] did not differ from the median CKD-EPI 
values measured at the end of denosumab administration 
[0.55 mL/s/1.73 m2
 (95% CI 0.40–0.61)]. A significant decrease in 
the level of osteocalcin and beta-crosslaps (βCTX) was observed 
after the therapy in comparison with baseline levels (p < 0.001) 
across the whole group of graft recipients (Table  2). Statistical 
significance was also reached in the smaller separate groups: 
(βCTX) difference (p < 0.01) for liver and simultaneous pancreas 
and kidney graft recipients (p < 0.01) and osteocalcin (p < 0.01) 
in both groups. Patients after isolated kidney Tx for βCTX 
(p < 0.001) and for osteocalcin (p < 0.001). A low level of vitamin 
25-OHD3 < 40 nmol/L (<16 μg/L) was observed in the case of 
7/46 (15.2%) tested patients at the beginning of therapy, but this 
finding only applied to 1/44 (2.3%) by the end of the therapy. An 
insufficient level of 25-OHD3 40–75  nmol/L (16–30  µg/L) was 
found in 13/46 (28.2%) patients at the beginning of denosumab 
therapy and in 15/44 (34%) patients upon termination of deno￾sumab therapy.
Bone Mineral Density
Osteoporosis of the L-spine (BMD T score ≤ −2.5) was the most 
frequent finding, applying to 47/63 (74.6%) subjects. Osteoporosis 
of the proximal femur applied to 34/63 (54%) patients and osteo￾porosis of the distal radius (33% radius; BMD T score ≤ −2.5) 
applied to 40/63 (63.5%) patients. Osteopenia (BMD T score <−1 
and > −2.5) of the L-spine occurred in 13/63 (20.6%) patients, of 
the proximal femur (BMD T score < −1 and > −2.5) in 28/63 
(44.4%) patients, and of the distal radius in 17/63 (27%) patients. 
Normal bone density of the L-spine was observed in 3/63 (4.8%) 
patients, of the proximal femur in only 1/63 (1.6%) patients and of 
the distal radius in 6/63 (9.5%) subjects. A BMD T score ≤ −2.5 
for both the L-spine and proximal femur was the case for 19/63 
(30.1%) subjects and for all three examined sites (L-spine, proxi￾mal femur, distal radius) in 17/63 (27%) subjects.

Lumbar spine osteoporosis mainly affected liver and kidney 
graft recipients; 14/14 (100%) and 28/34 (82.3%) patients, respec￾tively. Osteoporosis of the proximal femur was the most prevalent 
in patients after simultaneous pancreas and kidney transplanta￾tion [14/15 patients (93.3%)]. The presence of CKD-MBD and 
osteoporosis in kidney recipients after simultaneous pancreas 
and kidney transplantation could not be excluded because both 
diseases mostly coexist after transplantation. This is also applied 
to BMD measurements.
The mean T-score value of the osteoporotic L-spine at base￾line was −3.1 ± 0.6 and in all patients −2.7 ± 0.9. The proximal 
femur T-score was −3.6 ± 0.6 in patients with BMD < −2.5 and 
−2.5 ± 0.8 in all patients. For the distal radius, the pretreatment 
T-score was −3.6 ± 1.7 at the osteoporotic site and −2.8 ± 1.2 
in all patients. The T-score for patients with osteoporosis in all 
groups exceeded a −3.0 value, while the worst T-score results 
were for the distal radius in simultaneous kidney and pancreas 
recipients and kidney graft recipients (T-scores of −4.4 ± 1.2 and 
−3.7 ± 1.4, respectively).
After the therapy, the L-spine T-score improved, reach￾ing −1.8 ±  1.0 in all patients (p <  0.001). Hip T-score values 
increased to −2.0.1 ± 0.7 after the therapy (p < 0.01). There was 
only a mild, statistically insignificant improvement in the distal 
radius T-score after the therapy, reaching −2.6 ± 1.5 (p = 0.119) 
(Table 3).
Lumbar spine BMD improved in all treated patients, BMD 
of the proximal femur in 59/63 (94%) patients, and BMD of the 
distal radius increased in 33/63 (52%) subjects.
The mean BMD increase was 11.5 ±  6.2% for the L-spine 
with a T-score ≤ −2.5 and 10.4 ± 6.1% in all patients. BMD of 
the proximal femur increased by 10.4 ±  8.3% in patients with 
BMD  ≤ −2.5 (T-score at this site) and by 7.5  ±  7.3% in all 
patients. For the distal radius with BMD ≤ −2.5, the T-score was 
3.96 ± 10.1% and, in all patients, BMD increased to 2.34 ± 8.6% 
(Table  4). The best responders to denosumab therapy were as 
follows: (1) patients after liver transplantation localized to the 
L-spine, where the presence of osteoporosis decreased from 
14/14 to 4/14 cases, followed by (2) kidney graft recipients also 
at the L-spine site and (3) patients after simultaneous pancreas 
and kidney transplantation localized to the L spine and proximal 
femur (Table 5).
Denosumab therapy decreased the prevalence of osteoporosis 
(determined according to T-scores—WHO classification) in

proximal femur from 54 to 36% (18% decrease) (p < 0.01), and 
in the distal radius from 63 to 52% (11% decrease).
DISCUSSION
In this retrospective study, we analyzed the results of denosumab 
therapy in patients after solid organ transplantation. Osteoporosis 
and osteopenia are common complications in cases of long-term 
graft transplantation survival (17, 18). The different mechanisms 
of action offered by existing anti-osteoporotic drugs provide 
alternative strategies for osteoporosis treatment. Some suc￾cessfully transplanted patients exhibit impaired renal function. 
However, bisphosphonate therapy is not recommended in such 
cases, as bisphosphonates are not tolerated due to their adverse 
side effects. Reduced renal function occurs not only in renal 
grafts but can also appear in patients after liver or heart Tx. Until 
recently, osteoporosis therapy of patients with renal impairment 
was limited to the adjustment of calcium-phosphate metabolism 
and vitamin D levels, to the management of secondary hyper￾parathyroidism and to optimizing the maintenance of immu￾nosuppressive therapy. Now, however, innovative therapeutic 
strategies such as denosumab therapy offer promising solutions 
for osteoporosis treatment in these patients (19). Clinical stud￾ies indicate that long-term treatment with denosumab causes 
a continuous increase in BMD with low incidence of adverse 
effects. Denosumab has been successfully used for several years 
in postmenopausal osteoporosis therapy with proven lowering 
of bone reduction, increased BMD, and decreased vertebral and 
non-vertebral fracture risk (20). In contrast to other drugs that 
reduce bone resorption such as third-generation bisphospho￾nates, denosumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets RANK 
ligand. RANKL, which is mainly produced by osteocytes, sup￾ports osteoclast formation and activity. When denosumab binds 
to RANKL, it blocks its activity, decreasing the formation, func￾tion, and survival of osteoclasts and, therefore, bone resorption. 
These actions result in an increase in BMD and an improvement 
in bone strength (21). Denosumab may also have a favorable 
effect on posttransplant bone loss due to the effect of calcineurin 
inhibitors on osteoclast activity and glucocorticoid activation of 
the RANKL system (2). A significant advantage of denosumab 
therapy is that it can be used in patients with impaired renal 
function, and it is not known to exhibit any adverse interaction 
with other medications currently in use. Moreover, subcutaneous 
administration of denosumab every 6 months is a less burden￾some option for post-Tx patients who are administered large 
daily doses of various medications.
Despite reports that denosumab successfully improves BMD 
in patients with impaired renal function (CKD G 2–4) (22), cur￾rently, only a few reports concerning the use of denosumab in 
osteoporosis treatment of solid organ recipients exist (23–25). 
In the POSTOP study, denosumab was administered to newly 
transplanted kidney patients to prevent bone loss, even in 
subjects without osteoporosis, in the early posttransplant period 
(14). In our patients, the time elapsed since their previous 
transplantations was between 0 and 24 years (mean 6.4 years), 
with almost 1/3 (l9/63) patients surviving for more than 10 years 
after Tx survival. All of them were known to have osteoporosis 
(defined as a persistent low BMD with a T score ≤ −2.5 and/or 
a significant decrease of BMD compared to osteoporotic values) 
and 41% had undergone at least one recent osteoporotic fracture. 
Impaired renal function in these patients did not permit bispho￾sphonate therapy, while standard calcium/vitamin D combina￾tion therapy was not effective enough to improve bone density. 
Although we were aware of the heterogeneity concerning the 
pre-transplant history in our transplanted patients—duration 
of renal failure and dialysis, attempts to treat bone loss prior 
to transplantation, years elapsed since Tx, number of rejec￾tion episodes, menopausal status in women, and the variety of 
immunosuppressive medications used, including glucocorticoid 
dosage—we considered the introduction of denosumab therapy 
the only solution to prevent further bone loss. The therapy 
was well-tolerated in the first patients treated and, moreover, 
they showed significant improvement in BMD. The number of 
treated patients gradually increased, with 60% of them currently 
continuing with denosumab treatment. The mean increase in 
BMD for the whole group was more than 10% for the L-spine 
and 7–10% for the proximal femur during the relatively short 
period of treatment.
The risk factors associated with antiresorptive therapy using 
denosumab include hypocalcemia, osteonecrosis of the jaw, 
and increased incidence of infection (2). Hypocalcemia mainly 
jeopardizes patients with more advanced renal impairment (CKD 
G 4–5) (26). In our study, all patients were placed on a course 
of calcium and/or vitamin D substitution therapy. A low level of 
25OHD3 was found only in one patient on ongoing denosumab 
therapy. Mild hypocalcemia occurred in one patient with a pro￾gressive decline in renal function, but was successfully treated 
with a temporary increase in the usual daily calcium dose. No 
other person displayed clinical or laboratory signs of hypocal￾cemia during denosumab administration. Creatinine levels were 
stable up to 200  µmol/L in most of our transplanted patients 
throughout the course of therapy. Hypocalcemia occurs mainly 
during the first weeks after denosumab injection and, therefore, 
calcium levels should be measured thereafter. We usually monitor 
calcium levels within 1 month after the injection, especially in 
patients newly administered denosumab therapy and in those 
with unstable or higher creatinine values (CKD G 4), in order to 
negate the eventual decrease in calcium levels.

Osteonecrosis of the jaw was not observed among our deno￾sumab-treated graft recipients. Denosumab-associated incidence 
of jaw osteonecrosis in patients with osteoporosis is generally 
very low (0.15–0.001% of persons per year of therapy). The vast 
majority (>90%) of cases occur in oncology patients receiving 
high doses of intravenous bisphosphonates or subcutaneous 
denosumab (27). Additional risk factors include periodontal 
disease, oral surgical procedures, radiation and chemotherapy, 
diabetes, glucocorticoid use, and smoking. The non-occurrence 
of jaw osteonecrosis in our monitored patients can be explained 
by the fact that all transplantation candidates underwent a dental 
sanitation programme, followed by regular dental check-ups. 
None of our patients suffered subtrochanteric fractures during 
denosumab treatment.
A recently published study (28) reported more frequent 
episodes of urinary infection (cystitis) in denosumab-treated 
de novo kidney transplant recipients (34.9%) versus 25.2% in 
non-treated patients; no difference was found among other 
infections. We did not observe any increased incidence of 
infections in denosumab-treated patients in comparison with 
other graft recipients monitored at our institute. Neither did 
we consider it apt to perform a comparative study because of 
the heterogeneity of our graft recipient population. In most of 
our patients, a significant period of time had elapsed since their 
last Tx (there were only three newly transplanted patients) and, 
consequently, all had a history of various previous infectious 
complications since then. We did not observe any episode of 
urinary infection in the three patients who were put on deno￾sumab therapy during the first year after Tx, even though it 
must be stated that this number is too small to be statistically 
significant.
Approximately 60% of patients are still undergoing deno￾sumab therapy. In the case of 11 patients, treatment was 
terminated due to a substantial increase in BMD compared to 
non-osteoporotic values, while in three patients, an improvement 
in renal function enabled the use of bisphosphonates. The BMD 
development in this latter group of patients will be the subject 
of further investigation. Denosumab therapy was discontinued 
in the case of three patients who were due to resume dialysis, 
while another set of three patients were later treated without 
denosumab in another hospital. Of the 63 patients in our group, 
5 died while still on therapy: 3 from neuro/cardiovascular causes 
and 2 polymorbid patients from sepsis. Initially, we were not 
sure whether to prolong denosumab therapy in transplanted 
patients beyond a period of 2 years or in cases where there had 
been an improvement in the T-score above −2.0, as the data on 
application of the therapy in these instances are threadbare. On 
the other hand, the discontinuation of denosumab frequently 
leads to BMD loss and vertebral fractures. The deaths caused 
by sepsis in our group did not represent a difference with the 
usual number of fatal complications reported for those that 
are immune-compromised and (frequently) for polymorbid 
patients.
Bone density improved mainly in the L-spine across all graft 
recipient groups, with the highest increase at osteoporotic sites. 
BMD also significantly increased in the proximal femur locality. 
From a relative perspective, the weakest effect of denosumab was 
recorded in the distal forearm, in which case, BMD increased 
in 61% of patients and decreased or remained unchanged in 
39%. However, osteoporosis at this site is generally difficult to 
modify using accessible antiresorptive therapy. Furthermore, 
parathyroid hormone (PTH) values, which remained increased 
in all patients, preferentially exert a catabolic effect on the corti￾cal bone. PTH decreases by 50% about 6 months after kidney 
Tx but remains high in nearly 45% of graft recipients 2 years 
after transplantation (29). The main causes of persistent PTH 
elevation in transplanted patients are low vitamin D levels, 
hyperplasia, or adenoma of the parathyroid gland (which 
mainly affects kidney graft recipients) and impaired renal func￾tion. The mildly increased PTH levels observed in our study 
probably reflected our patients’ impaired renal function, with 
no significant difference observed after denosumab therapy. 
The modest increase in PTH may represent an appropriate 
adaptive response to declining renal function due to phospha￾turic effects and increased bone resistance to PTH (30). We did 
not observe the parathyroid adenomas associated with more 
severe hyperparathyroidism. Parathyroid adenomas, which 
are less common in kidney graft recipients, have recently been 
successfully prevented with paricalcitol therapy introduced 
during the pretransplant period. We observed no significant 
changes in parathormone or creatinine levels as a result of 
denosumab therapy. On the other hand, the decrease of acceler￾ated bone turnover markers (BTM) was significant, a finding 
that correlated with improvement in bone density after therapy. 
Monitoring these markers is restricted by the fact that there 
are currently no reference standards for transplanted patients. 
Additionally, BTM are impacted by a number of factors such as 
age, gender, medication, and renal impairment (2). The eleva￾tion of mean BTM in our patients before denosumab therapy 
along with the relatively non-suppressed osteocalcin and βCTX 
levels below expected subnormal values were influenced by 
impaired renal clearance and, therefore, could not completely 
reflect bone turnover. However, comparing these values can be 
a valuable additional method in the early assessment of treat￾ment responses.
CONCLUSION
Denosumab therapy markedly improved BMD in solid organ 
recipients. A significant increase in T-scores was observed in 
the L-spine and hips. The prevalence of osteoporosis (diag￾nosed according to T-score values) in the L-spine decreased 
by 48% and in the hips by 18%, even following the relatively 
short duration of therapy. Denosumab therapy was well￾tolerated, and we did not observe any serious complications 
such as osteonecrosis of the jaw or subtrochanteric fractures, 
or indeed, any particular increase in infectious complications. 
These findings indicate that denosumab could be a possible 
useful option for osteoporosis therapy in the organ trans￾plant population, especially in those with renal impairment. 
Nevertheless, further designated studies must be conducted 
to demonstrate its long-term safety and the probable ben￾eficial effects on fracture risk in transplanted patients with 
osteoporosis.

ETHICS STATEMENT
This study was retrospective, and we analyzed results of patients 
who were already treated in past or currently for osteoporosis 
with denosumab at our Endocrine and Nephrology out-patient 
clinics. The therapy with Denosumab was introduced in sub￾jects with renal impairment and with osteoporosis of L spine 
and/or hips as an alternative treatment to bisphosphonates. 
More than 40% of those patients had a history of fragility frac￾ture. All patients were regularly physically examined and their 
laboratory results were controlled. All patients treated in our 
hospital gave routinely informed consent with examination 
and treatment. The data for our manuscript were retrospec￾tively collected from patients’ files. However, biochemical and 
DEXA results were strictly anonymized during the evaluation 
process. The data are presented as means and medians eventu￾ally in percentage and, therefore, the individual patients are 
not absolutely traceable.
