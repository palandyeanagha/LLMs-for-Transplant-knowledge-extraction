ABSTRACT
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is becoming one of the most important causes for chronic liver 
disease and also hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Sri Lanka. This tendency is also recognized worldwide. 
More than half of the middle-aged and elderly adults in urban Sri Lanka have ultrasonic evidence of NAFLD. 
The NAFLD is also identified in population from rural areas of Sri Lanka and also in children. Nonalcoholic 
steatohepatitis (NASH) cirrhosis is the most common cause of referral for liver transplantation in Sri 
Lankans. The NASH is also the most common cause for rejecting potential donors for liver transplantation 
in Sri Lanka. Patients who underwent liver transplantation for cryptogenic cirrhosis developed evidence 
of NASH following liver transplantation. Recent evidence suggests that there is a genetic component to 
NAFLD. PNPLA3, a single gene polymorphism linked to the short arm of chromosome 22, is associated 
with the severity of NAFLD. The presence of this genetic polymorphism appears to carry higher risk of 
patients with NAFLD developing NASH with fibrosis cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. In a large 
population-based study from Sri Lanka, there was a tendency to develop NAFLD associated with this 
genetic polymorphism. In a population-based study, NAFLD was identified as an independent risk factor 
for development of diabetes. This association is recognized worldwide now. Most patients with HHC in 
Sri Lanka developed it on a back ground of cryptogenic cirrhosis. At the same time, the prevalence of the 
markers for hepatitis B and C was rare in Sri Lankan patients with HCC.

INTRODUCTION
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is one of the most 
important health-related issues in Sri Lanka. Available 
evidence suggests that NAFLD is the most common 
chronic liver diseases in the country. In a large hospital￾based study carried out recently, cryptogenic cirrhosis 
and alcoholic liver disease were found to be the two 
predominant etiological factors for cirrhosis in Sri Lanka.1
Many consider NASH, the severe form of NAFLD with 
hepatic inflammation, to be the predominant etiology 
for cryptogenic cirrhosis. Currently, NASH is believed 
to be responsible for the most number of patients with 
cryptogenic cirrhosis worldwide. In a more recent study, 
cryptogenic cirrhosis was the predominant cause for 
listing for liver transplantation in Sri Lanka.2
 Cryptogenic 
cirrhosis is also considered to be the most common 
etiology responsible for HCC in Sri Lanka.3
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease represents a spectrum 
of liver disease encompassing simple fatty infiltration of
the liver parenchyma (steatosis), fatty infiltration and 
inflammation NASH, and cirrhosis, in the absence of 
excessive alcohol consumption.4,5 Nonalcoholic fatty 
liver disease is now considered to be the most common 
chronic liver disease in the world.6
 The worldwide 
prevalence of NAFLD varies between 15 and 40% in 
different populations. However, since the diagnosis of 
NASH requires histological assessment, the prevalence of 
NASH is unclear and is estimated to be around 10 to 30% 
of NAFLD patients. A percentage of patients with NASH 
will end up with end-stage liver disease and HCC. It is 
now recognized that NAFLD is the most common cause 
of liver dysfunction in developed countries. Nonalcoholic 
fatty liver disease is on the increase in the developing 
countries as well. This is most likely due to improving 
living standards, increasing prevalence of unhealthy 
eating habits, and sedentary lifestyles. Nonalcoholic 
fatty liver disease is now considered to be the hepatic 
component of the metabolic syndrome. Risk factors

for NAFLD such as diabetes mellitus and obesity are 
rapidly on the rise worldwide, resulting in the increasing 
prevalence of NAFLD.
In South Asia, traditionally the chronic liver disease 
burden has been due to hepatitis B and C virus. 
Surprisingly, this trend has not been identified from Sri 
Lanka where the burden of chronic viral hepatitis has 
always been low. Many factors would have contributed 
to this tendency. These include the centrally controlled 
blood banks by the state sector, early introduction of 
the use of disposable needles to the country, and the 
relatively low popularity of the intravenous drug abuse in 
the country. Low popularity of the use of intramuscular 
route of injections among general practitioners and 
the public would also have contributed to this trend. The 
established trend of viral hepatitis in South Asia as the 
predominant form of chronic liver disease is expected to 
reverse toward metabolic liver disease, predominantly 
toward NAFLD in the near future. This is mainly to due 
to advances in the field of therapeutics in hepatology. This 
trend is already visible in other South Asian countries like 
Nepal and India. Improving healthcare facilities would 
also have contributed immensely to this change. With the 
advances in the field such as the universal immunization 
against hepatitis B, and the availability of the cheaper 
and effective antiviral for hepatitis C, the prevalence of 
chronic viral hepatitis is expected to go down further 
gradually, and NASH is expected to become the dominant 
chronic liver disease in the region in the future.
The prevalence of NAFLD among adults in Sri Lanka 
is high. In a large population-based study from urban 
Sri Lanka, among 2,985 adults (aged 35–64 years), 974 
(32.6%) were found to have NAFLD on ultrasonography.7
The presence of NAFLD was strongly associated with 
the constituents of the metabolic syndrome. In a similar 
study, performed in a rural tea-cultivating, physically 
active, low-income population of adults, the prevalence 
rate was predictably lower than the urban figures but still 
significant at 18%.8
 The urban cohort, when followed up 
for 7 years and subjected to ultrasonography of the liver 
again, showed their prevalence of NAFLD had increased 
dramatically to nearly 66% in this now aging (42–71 
years) population.9
 The annual incidence of NAFLD in 
this population was 6.6%.
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease was the most common 
cause among patients undergoing liver biopsies for 
unexplained elevation of liver enzymes in a hospital￾based study from Sri Lanka. Of the liver biopsies 
performed on 296 patients with unexplained elevation 
of liver enzymes, 100 (35.1%) had NASH.10 Although 
traditionally NASH is considered a disease of obese 
females, there were significant proportion of lean males 
with NASH in this group. The clinical biochemical and 
histological features of NASH in this group were similar 
to features of NASH that were reported in patients from 
the Western countries. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease
is a significant issue among children in Sri Lanka and 
worldwide. Advanced hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis have 
been reported in Sri Lankan children with NASH.11
Recent evidence also suggests that NAFLD is a 
multisystem disease.12 Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease 
patients carry a higher risk for developing diabetes 
mellitus, ischemic heart disease, and chronic kidney 
disease. Majority of patients with NAFLD die of 
cardiovascular causes. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease 
increases the risk of diabetes approximately twofold. In 
a large population-based study from Sri Lanka, patients 
with ultrasonically diagnosed NAFLD when followed 
up for 3 years had higher risk of developing diabetes 
compared with patients without NAFLD.13 Here NAFLD 
was an independent risk factor for the development 
of diabetes mellitus. This is considered to be due to 
hepatic lipid accumulation leading to insulin resistance. 
It appears as if more severe the NAFLD, the greater the 
risk of developing diabetes.
Energy excess alone cannot explain NAFLD and 
NASH always. It is well established that some patients 
develop these disease entities without demonstrable 
risk factors like diabetes or obesity, either central or 
abdominal. Familial clustering of NAFLD is very well 
recognized. Recently, possible predisposition to fat 
accumulation in the liver and the progression of liver 
disease have been demonstrated in individuals with 
certain genetic polymorphisms. Patients carrying these 
genes are shown to have severe forms of the illness more 
often. This predisposition is demonstrated throughout 
the entire spectrum of NAFLD, from simple steatosis to 
NASH, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and HCC. This predisposition 
for NAFLD appears to be expressed even in the absence 
of the traditional risk factors for NAFLD like obesity and 
diabetes. Patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing 
protein 3 (PNPLA3) is one of the genetic polymorphisms 
most widely studied. There is very robust evidence for 
this genetic polymorphism for its association with NASH 
cirrhosis since it was first described in 2008.14 Some 
researchers consider this PNPLA3-associated NASH 
to be a distinct entity from the common NAFLD that 
we encounter in patients with multiple metabolic risk 
factors.15 This genetic polymorphism has been described 
in patients with NAFLD worldwide including South 
Asia. In a large population-based study from Sri Lanka, 
a significant association was observed for PNPLA3 
polymorphism and susceptibility to NAFLD.16 This 
gene is localized in the long arm of chromosome 22. The 
genetic defect results in the loss of enzyme activity of 
triacyl glycerol lipase, resulting in the accumulation of

fat in adipocytes and also in hepatocytes. Many other 
genes that increase the susceptibility to NAFLD have 
been described since then.
As mentioned earlier, cryptogenic cirrhosis is the 
predominant etiology for cirrhosis in patients listing 
for liver transplantation in Sri Lanka. In patients not 
receiving a liver transplantation, the survival rates 
among cryptogenic cirrhosis patients and alcoholic 
cirrhosis patients are similar.1
 Living donor liver 
transplantation has become an effective alternative 
to cadaveric organ shortage in Asia. Preliminary 
experience from Sri Lanka shows that NAFLD is one of 
the main reasons for rejecting potential donors of liver.17
This is experienced at other liver transplant centers 
from the region as well. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is 
well recognized to recur in patients who undergo liver 
transplantation for cryptogenic cirrhosis. In five patients 
transplanted for cryptogenic cirrhosis, all had evidence 
of recurrence of varying stages of NAFLD on biopsy 
during follow-up.18
Although hepatitis B and C are the leading causes for 
HCC worldwide, HCC risk is also higher in other forms 
of cirrhosis like alcoholic cirrhosis and hemochromatosis. 
The exact reason for higher risk for HCC in alcoholic 
cirrhosis is not very well established. It is well recognized 
that NASH cirrhosis also carries a higher risk of HCC. 
It is also well recognized that HCC could complicate 
NASH with fibrosis even in the absence of cirrhosis. 
Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis cirrhosis appears to be 
the predominant etiology for HCC in Sri Lanka. In a 
hospital-based study from Sri Lanka, of the 150 patients 
with HCC, 61 had alcohol-related cirrhosis and 89 had 
cryptogenic cirrhosis. None of the patients with HCC 
were positive for hepatitis B s antigen or hepatitis C 
antibody.3
 However, in a previous study, 16% of patients 
with HCC showed evidence of the presence of hepatitis 
B and C when investigated for the evidence of molecular 
markers for hepatitis B deoxyribonucleic acid and 
hepatitis C ribonucleic acid respectively.19 Data from our 
study suggest that HCC in cryptogenic cirrhosis may be 
behaving differently to other types of HCC. In our cohort 
of patients, more single nodular type of HCC was seen 
in cryptogenic cirrhosis, and diffuse-type tumors were 
more common in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis.
Our research findings reveal that NAFLD is the 
predominant liver disease burden in the country. Un￾fortunately, with rising diabetes and obesity, the trend is 
expected to worsen in the future. Nonalcoholic fatty liver 
disease is a major problem in the community in both adults 
and children. In the absence of an accepted therapeutic 
option other than weight reduction and lifestyle modifi￾cations, the emphasis should be on preventive strategies 
initiated from childhood.
