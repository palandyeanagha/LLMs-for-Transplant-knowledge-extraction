Abstract
Background: Urinary tract infection (UTI) occurs in 30%-50% of individuals with autosomal dominant polycystic
kidney disease (ADPKD). However, the clinical relevance of asymptomatic pyuria in ADPKD patients remains
unknown.
Methods: We retrospectively reviewed medical records of 256 ADPKD patients who registered to the ADPKD clinic
at Seoul National University Hospital from Aug 1999 to Aug 2010. We defined the asymptomatic pyuria as more
than 5-9 white blood cells in high-power field with no related symptoms or signs of overt UTI. Patients were
categorized into 2 groups depending on its duration and frequency: Group A included non-pyuria and transient
pyuria patients; Group B included recurrent and persistent pyuria patients. The association between asymptomatic
pyuria and both the development of overt UTI and the deterioration of renal function were examined.
Results: With a mean follow-up duration of 65.3 months, 176 (68.8%) out of 256 patients experienced 681 episodes of
asymptomatic pyuria and 50 episodes of UTI. The annual incidence of asymptomatic pyuria was 0.492 episodes/patient/year.
The patients in group B showed female predominance (58.5% vs. 42.0%, P=0.01) and experienced an upper UTI more
frequently (hazard ratio: 4.612, 95% confidence interval: 1.735-12.258; P=0.002, adjusted for gender and hypertension).
The annual change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (ΔeGFR) was significantly larger in magnitude in group B
than in group A (-2.7±4.56 vs. -1.17±5.8, respectively; P=0.01). Age and Group B found to be the independent variables
for ΔeGFR and developing end-stage renal disease (16.0% vs. 4.3%, respectively; P=0.001).
Conclusions: Chronic asymptomatic pyuria may increase the risk of developing overt UTI and may contribute to
declining renal function in ADPKD.

Background
Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD)
is the most prevalent hereditary kidney disease with the
incidence of 1 case per 400-1,000 live births [1]. ADPKD
is the 4th most common cause of end-stage renal disease
(ESRD), occurring in 4%-10% of ESRD patients who
initiate renal replacement therapy. However, patients
exhibit renal function impairment only when their
kidneys are loaded with cysts [1,2].
Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common
renal complications in ADPKD. Approximately 30%-50%
of ADPKD patients experience an episode of UTI in their
lifetime. UTI is more prevalent in females, and a gram￾negative enteric bacterium is the most common pathogen
[2-5]. Aside from cystitis, upper UTIs—including renal cyst
infection and acute pyelonephritis (APN)—are serious

enough to result in long-term hospital care and call for
aggressive antibiotic therapy. Despite careful management,
UTI often recurs or results in treatment failure [4-6].
Moreover, asymptomatic pyuria is frequently observed in
ADPKD patients and often persists or relapses without
treatment [7]. However, the clinical implications of asymp￾tomatic pyuria in ADPKD have not been investigated.
Risk factors for kidney failure in ADPKD patients have
been suggested to include the PKD1 gene mutation,
hypertension, large kidney size, male gender, proteinuria,
and a younger age at diagnosis [8,9]. However, some
studies have investigated the impact of UTI on renal
function in ADPKD patients [9,10]. In 2006, Ahmed
et al. reported that UTI is a risk factor for deteriorating
renal function in ADPKD patients along with other trad￾itional risk factors [9]. In another retrospective study,
UTI was suggested to be a cause of renal deterioration
based on the finding that renal function was preserved
better in the group of patients who used prophylactic
antibiotics than in the control group [10].
In the present study, we investigated the impact of
asymptomatic pyuria on the development of overt UTI
and the deterioration of renal function in ADPKD patients.
Methods
Study population
This study was performed as a retrospective, single-center,
case–control study. Among the patients who registered at
the ADPKD clinic at Seoul National University Hospital
from Aug 1999 through Aug 2010, we retrospectively
reviewed medical records of 311 individuals and collected
data from 256 adult patients who received ≥ 2 urinalysis
tests during their follow-up period. Patients were seen in
the clinic based on their renal function: every 3-6 months
for those in CKD stage I-II, every 2-3 months for those in
CKD stage III, and every 6-8 weeks for those in CKD stage
IV. In addition to the disease severity, we followed up
patients more frequently after overt UTI episodes or when
they needed acute managements such as high blood pres￾sure or new onset hematuria. Patients with either an esti￾mated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of < 15 ml/min/
1.73m2 or receiving renal replacement therapy were
excluded from the analysis (n = 17). Patients with a brief
follow-up duration of < 6 months (n = 38) were also
excluded from the analysis.
Definition
ADPKD was diagnosed according to the Unified Criteria
for Ultrasonographic Diagnosis of ADPKD as proposed
by Pei et al [11]. We defined asymptomatic pyuria as
higher than 5-9 white blood cells/high-power field
(WBC/HPF) in a random urine sample without symp￾toms related to overt UTI. The duration of pyuria epi￾sode was defined from detection to resolution of pyuria
in a subsequent urinalysis.
We categorized the patients into following 4 groups
depending on the duration and frequency of the asymp￾tomatic pyuria: no pyuria, transient pyuria, recurrent
pyuria, and persistent pyuria. The no pyuria group
included patients who did not experience pyuria during
the study period. The transient pyuria group included
patients who had fewer than 3 episodes of pyuria and
patients who had ≥ 3 episodes of pyuria with inter￾episode intervals longer than 6 months. Recurrent pyuria
was defined as ≥ 3 episodes of pyuria within 6 months.
The persistent pyuria group was defined as patients who
had pyuria for ≥ 1 month. After this classification, the no
pyuria and transient pyuria groups were classified as group

A, and the recurrent pyuria and persistent pyuria groups
were classified as group B (the chronic pyuria group).
To evaluate the effect of pyuria on the occurrence of
subsequent UTI or renal function decline, we addition￾ally divided the patients into two groups based on the
number of pyuria episodes in the first year of follow up.
Groupno pyuria/1st year was defined as the group who did
not experience any pyuria episodes, and Group1-4 pyuria/
1st year was the sum of patients who experienced 1-4
pyuria episodes during the first year of follow up.
Acute cystitis was diagnosed based on the presence of
lower urinary tract symptoms such as dysuria, a burning
sensation upon voiding, frequency, urgency, or suprapu￾bic pain with no clinical evidence of an upper urinary
tract infection. Upper UTI included both APN and renal
cyst infection. The APN was diagnosed clinically when
patients develop rapid urinary symptoms with high fever
and flank pain and the urinalysis shows signs of urinary
tract infection [12]. Cyst infection was confirmed if a cyst
aspirate shows definite microorganism or neutrophils deb￾ris. In addition, cyst infection was clinically suspected
when fever >38.5°C develops without definite pyuria, focal
tenderness over the suspected cyst, positive blood culture
without urine culture positivity [13]. The imaging tools
such as magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasonography,
computed tomography, or positron emission tomography
were taken to supplement the diagnosis of cyst infection.
Serum creatinine (sCr) was measured using the Jaffe
method [14]. The Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology
(CKD-EPI) equation was used to calculate eGFR [15,16].
The onset of ESRD was defined as the time at which
renal replacement therapy (hemodialysis, peritoneal dia￾lysis, or transplantation) was initiated [17].
Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS ver￾sion 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Continuous
variables were expressed as the mean ± standard devi￾ation. The independent t-test or Mann–Whitney U test
was used to compare the continuous variables among
the groups, and the Chi-square test was used to analyze
the categorical variables. The one-way analysis of vari￾ance (ANOVA) was used to compare the continuous
variables among the 3 groups. The log rank test was
used to compare UTI occurrence between group A and
group B, and the multiple Cox regression model was
used to identify risk factors. Differences with P < 0.05
were considered to be statistically significant.
This study was approved by the Institutional Review
Board of Seoul National University Hospital (H-0901-
046-269). Informed consent was obtained from the sub￾jects in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
Results
Clinical Characteristics Associated with Asymptomatic
Pyuria in ADPKD Patients
The baseline characteristics of the 256 patients are pre￾sented in Table 1. The age of the study participants was
48.1 ± 12.8 years, and almost the same numbers of male
and female subjects were enrolled. The mean follow-up
duration was 65.3 ± 43.2 months, and the initial eGFR
was 91.1 ± 29.2 ml/min/1.73m2
. Asymptomatic pyuria
was observed in 26.2% of the patients at their first office
visit. The incidence of asymptomatic pyuria was 0.492 epi￾sodes/patient/year. One hundred and seventy-six patients
(68.8%) experienced ≥ 1 episode of asymptomatic pyuria
during the course of their follow-up. Asymptomatic pyuria
accounted for 93.2% of the total number of infection epi￾sodes (Table 2). The patients in group B (n = 94, 36.7%)
comprised a higher percentage of females (58.5% vs. 42.0%
for group A; P = 0.01) and had a longer follow-up duration
(88.5 ± 37.8 vs. 51.8 ± 40.4 months for group A; P < 0.001).
The prevalence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and
urinary stones did not differ between the groups (Table 1,
P > 0.05).
Urine culture was performed in only 4.6% of the patients
with asymptomatic pyuria. In most of asymptomatic pyuria
cases (95.4%), urine culture was not performed. Among
those who underwent urine culture study, 6.5% showed
negative results. The most common microorganisms were

Escherichia coli (34.5%), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae
(13.8%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (11.6%), Streptococcus

Streptococcus agalactiae (7.0%), Serratia marcescens (3.4%),
Corynebacterium species (3.4%), and Staphylococcus aureus
(3.4%).
Association of Asymptomatic Pyuria with Overt UTI
During the observational period, 33 (12.9%) patients deve￾loped an overt UTI. The follow-up duration was longer for
the overt UTI group than for the patients without an overt
UTI (81.6 months vs. 62.4 months, respectively; P = 0.01).
More patients in group B experienced an overt UTI during
their follow-up than the patients in group A (66.7% vs.
32.3%, respectively; P < 0.001; Table 3). Age, gender,
diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and urinary stones did not
increase the risk of developing an overt UTI. Compared to
group A, group B had shorter periods of overt UTI-free
survival and shorter periods of upper UTI-free survival
(Figure 1). In addition, when we used prospective groups
(Groupno pyuria/1st year and Group1-4 pyuria/1st year) based on
the number of pyuria episodes in the first year of follow
up, the Group1-4 pyuria/1st year demonstrated the even
shorter periods of both overt UTI-free survival and upper
UTI-free survival (Additional file 1: Figure S1). A Cox
regression analysis was performed to determine whether
group B is an independent factor for overt UTI and upper
UTI. The forward stepwise method was used, and age, gen￾der, hypertension, urinary stones, group B, and initial eGFR
were included in the final analysis. In the univariate
analysis, group B and lower initial eGFR were the factors
associated with overt UTI. Multiple Cox regression analysis
revealed that group B is an independent factor for overt
UTI (hazard ratio 4.636, 95% confidence interval 1.898 to
11.323; P = 0.001; Table 4). In addition, group B independ￾ently increased the risk of upper UTI compared to group A
(hazard ratio 4.612, 95% confidence interval 1.735 to
12.258; P = 0.002; Table 5). Because the incidence of acute
cystitis was low, a Cox regression analysis for acute cystitis
was not performed.
Clinical Manifestations of Overt UTI in ADPKD
Among 33 patients with an overt UTI, 4 experienced both
acute cystitis and an upper UTI, 6 had only acute cystitis
and 23 had only upper UTI. The incidence of acute cystitis
was 0.012 episodes/patient/year, and the incidence of
upper UTI was 0.023 episodes/patient/year. A total of 27
patients experienced 33 episodes of upper UTI (13 epi￾sodes of APN and 20 episodes of renal cyst infection). The
most common pathogen associated with upper UTI was
E. coli (24.2%), followed by K. pneumoniae (9.1%). One
patient had a renal abscess without a cyst infection, and
this was categorized as APN. All four patients (14.8%) who
experienced repeated upper UTI episodes were in group B.
Annual Reduction Rate of eGFR in ADPKD Patients with
Asymptomatic Pyuria
The initial eGFR at the first office visit did not differ
between group A and group B. However, the final eGFR in
group B was significantly lower than that in group A
(63.3 ± 37.0 vs. 85.5 ± 31.7 ml/min/1.73m2
, respectively;
P < 0.001). Because the follow-up duration can affect the
final eGFR value, we compared the annual change in eGFR
(ΔeGFR) between group A and group B and found that
group B showed a faster decline in eGFR than group A
(-2.7 ± 4.56 vs. -1.17 ± 5.8 ml/min/1.73m2 per year,

respectively; P = 0.01; Figure 2). When we performed a
subgroup analysis in baseline CKD stage I-II, group B
showed even greater annual decline of eGFR compared to
group A in CKD (-3.36 ± 3.47 vs. -1 ± 5.97 ml/min/1.73m2
per year, P = 0.002, Additional file 2: Figure S2). However,
when we performed the independent t-test in the prospect￾ive groups based on the number of pyuria episodes in the
first year (Groupno pyuria/1st year and Group1-4 pyuria/1st year),
the difference in GFR decline rate disappeared (Additional
file 3: Table S1 and Additional file 4: Table S2).
To analyze the risk factors that are associated with
ΔeGFR, we performed a linear regression analysis. In a
univariate analysis, age, diabetes mellitus, hypertension,
overt UTI, and group B were associated with ΔeGFR. In
a multiple linear regression model, group B was revealed
as an independent risk factor for a faster decline in
eGFR (B = -1.53, 95% confidence interval -2.904 to -0.155;
P = 0.03; Table 6). More patients in group B (n = 15,
16.0%) reached ESRD during observational period com￾pared to the patients in group A (n = 7, 4.3%; P = 0.001;
Figure 2).
Annual eGFR Reduction Rate in the ADPKD Patients with
Chronic Pyuria
To control for the possible confounding effects of overt
UTI in group B, we excluded patients who experienced
overt UTI from both group A and group B. The subse￾quent cohorts were renamed group AUTI- and group
BUTI-
, respectively. The patients who experienced overt
UTI were separately classified as the overt UTI group
irrespective of whether they were in group A or group B.
A total of 151 patients in group AUTI-, 72 patients in
group BUTI-, and 33 patients in the overt UTI group were
included in the analysis. The group BUTI- patients exhibited
a greater ΔeGFR compared to group AUTI- (-2.6 vs. -0.9
ml/min/1.73m2 per year, respectively; P = 0.009; Figure 3).
The overt UTI group patients exhibited an even greater
ΔeGFR at 1 year after their UTI episode (-3.6 ml/min/
1.73m2 per year). The clinical characteristics, including
ΔeGFR, were compared between the groups (Table 7).
There were statistically significant differences in gender,
follow-up duration, final eGFR, ΔeGFR, and the incidence
of ESRD between group AUTI- and other groups. However,
the differences between group BUTI- and the overt UTI
group were not statistically significant.
Discussion
Although asymptomatic pyuria is quite common in
patients with ADPKD, its etiology, incidence, and clinical
implications are poorly documented. We observed that
chronic asymptomatic pyuria (group B) was associated
with an increased incidence of overt UTI and ESRD and

with greater ΔeGFR. In addition, group B was an inde￾pendent risk factor for ΔeGFR when adjusted for age,
follow-up duration, and comorbidity.
In our study, chronic asymptomatic pyuria was as￾sociated with overt UTI. The group B showed higher
occurrence rate of overt UTI and upper UTI. This was
true when we performed the analysis in the prospective
cohort based on the number of pyuria episodes in the
first year of follow up. The patients who have experi￾enced pyuria in the first year showed higher incidence of
overt and upper UTI in the following periods. Although
urine culture was performed in very few cases, our study
result suggests that asymptomatic pyuria is the risk fac￾tor for subsequent UTI events and therefore ADPKD
patients with pyuria should be closely monitored in the
Figure 2 Renal outcomes of patients according to asymptomatic pyuria. There was no significant difference between group A and group B in
initial eGFR (92.5 ± 27.1 vs. 88.7 ± 32.5 ml/min/1.73m2
; P=0.35). However, the final eGFR was significantly lower in group B than in group A (63.3 ± 37.0

respectively; P=0.01). The incidence of ESRD was also significantly higher in group B than in group A (n = 15, 16.0% vs. n=7, 4.3%; P=0.001). eGFR,

outpatient clinic. In our study, a total of 50 episodes of
overt UTI occurred in 33 (12.9%) patients over approxi￾mately 5 years. The incidence of overt UTI (0.014 epi￾sodes/patient/year) in our patients was similar to the
incidence that was reported recently by Sallee et al.
(0.011 episodes/patient/year) [13].
Chronic asymptomatic pyuria and overt UTI were also
associated with ΔeGFR in the ADPKD patients. The
patients in group B exhibited a greater ΔeGFR (-2.7 ± 4.56
vs. -1.17 ± 5.8 ml/min/1.73m2 per year; P = 0.01) and a
higher incidence of ESRD (16.0% vs. 4.3%, P = 0.001) than
the patients in group A. There have been some reports
about the proportion of asymptomatic pyuria in normal
population. However, it has not been studied how chronic
asymptomatic pyuria affects renal functions [18,19]. The
finding that the microorganism grown in the urine cultures
of asymptomatic pyuria patients was similar to the
common pathogen found in urinary tract infections may
suggest that asymptomatic pyuria may be a type of subclin￾ical bacterial infection. Because chronic infection is a risk
factor for renal function deterioration, chronic asymptom￾atic pyuria may be a form of undetected subclinical bac￾terial infection that causes progressive renal function
deterioration.
Another explanation may be that chronic asymptom￾atic pyuria or overt UTI is a direct cause of cystogenesis.
Many hypotheses have been proposed for the generation
and progression of renal cysts in ADPKD patients. The
two-hit model that was proposed by Germino et al. sug￾gested that a somatic mutation on the opposite allele
might lead to a loss of heterozygosity [20-24]. In their
theory, the 1st hit refers to the germline mutation, and
the 2nd hit refers to the somatic mutation. However, the
2nd hit does not always lead to an instant renal cyst for￾mation [25-27]. The partial loss of the protein polycystin

overt UTI and pyuria type. To Evaluate the effects of
asymptomatic pyuria and overt UTI on ΔeGFR, the incidence of UTI
and the pyuria type divided into 3 groups. Group AUTI-, non-pyuria
or transient pyuria without an overt UTI episode; group BUTI-,
recurrent or persistent pyuria without overt UTI; overt UTI, at least
one episode of UTI. UTI, urinary tract infection.

in primary cilia did not induce a change in adult renal
tubular epithelial cells. However, when a 3rd hit such as
ischemic damage [25,27] or nephrotoxic injury [26] was
applied to the renal tubular epithelial cells, abnormal cel￾lular proliferation and the cyst formation were observed
[10,28,29]. A previous study of germ-free Sprague–Dawley
rats found that endotoxins and nordihydroguaiaretic acid
can induce renal cystic disease and leukocyte-mediated
renal damage independent of a secondary infection [30].
In addition, the roles of TNF-alpha in cyst formation [31]
and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in renal deterioration by
peritubular capillary dysfunction [32] have been reported.
Therefore, inflammation caused by overt UTI or chronic
asymptomatic pyuria itself can serve as the 3rd hit and may
lead to the cellular proliferation, cyst formation and fibro￾sis. However, there is still a possibility that asymptomatic
pyuria is merely a marker of renal progression rather than
a risk factor for future GFR decline. In order to elucidate
causal relationship between asymptomatic pyuria and GFR
decline, a well-designed prospective study is warranted.
The limitation of this study is that it was a single-center,
retrospective study. Because the number of episodes of
overt UTI was low, we could not detect a statistically
significant difference in ΔeGFR between the chronic py￾uria and overt UTI groups. Among the overt UTI epi￾sodes, 7 out of 20 cases were not associated with a loss of
eGFR. Therefore, further prospective studies are needed
to determine how chronic asymptomatic pyuria and overt
UTI may cause a loss of eGFR. Moreover, we did not
measure either cyst volume or kidney volume as an out￾come. However, measuring total kidney volume should be
considered in the future studies, as this parameter has
been used as a surrogate marker for renal function deteri￾oration in the early stage of the disease [33,34]. Finally,
urine culture study was only performed in very few cases
of pyuria. Whether asymptomatic pyuria is a form of in￾flammation or asymptomatic bacteriuria should be docu￾mented in further studies.
The present study shows that chronic asymptomatic
pyuria increases the incidence of overt UTI and may
contribute to declining renal function in ADPKD patients.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report that
chronic asymptomatic pyuria may precede overt UTI and
renal function deterioration in ADPKD patients. Our
results support a previous report by Idrizi et al., which
suggested that chronic treatment with antibiotics can
preserve renal function. Although the mechanism of renal
function deterioration with chronic pyuria is unclear, it is
worthwhile to attempt to control chronic pyuria in
ADPKD patients.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we found that chronic asymptomatic pyuria
may increase the risk of developing overt UTI and may
contribute to declining renal function in ADPKD. Further
prospective study is warranted to reveal the causal rela￾tionship between chronic pyuria and the development of
overt UTI and renal function deterioration.

Additional file 1: Figure S1. Higher incidence of overt urinary tract
infection (UTI) and upper UTI in the pyuria group in the first year. The
group of patients with 1–4 pyuria episodes in the first year of follow up
(Group1-4pyuria/1st year) had higher incidence of overt UTI and upper UTI
compared to the no pyuria group (Groupno pyuria/1st year).
Additional file 2: Figure S2. Chronic pyuria group (Group B) shows
greater annual decline of eGFR in the conserved renal function group
(chronic kidney disease stage I-II). In CKD I-II group, chronic pyuria group
(group B) showed much greater annual decline of eGFR compared to
group A (−3.36 ± 3.47 vs. -1 ± 5.97 ml/min/1.73m2 per year, P = 0.002).
The follow up duration between the groups were significantly different
(Group A vs. Group B, 54.12 ± 41.0 vs. 95.08 ± 34.3 months).
Additional file 3: Table S1. Frequency of pyuria in the 1st year of
follow up. Among 256 patients, 129 patients did not experienced any
pyuria episode in the 1st year of follow up. The other 127 patients
experienced ≥1 episode of pyuria in the initial year.
Additional file 4: Table S2. Greater annual eGFR decline in the initial
pyuria group (Group1-4pyuria/1st year) compared to the no pyuria group
(Groupno pyuria/1st year). Although statistically insignificant, the initial
pyuria group (Group1-4pyuria/1st year) showed greater annual eGFR decline
rate compared to the no pyuria group (Groupno pyuria/1st year)
(−2.25 ± 6.38 vs. -1.21 ± 4.24 mL/min/1.73m2
