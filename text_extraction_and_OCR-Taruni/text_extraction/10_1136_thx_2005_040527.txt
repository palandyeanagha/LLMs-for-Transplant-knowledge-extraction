Abstract
Background: Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD) often present with severe acute exacerbations requiring
hospital treatment. However, little is known about the prognostic
consequences of these exacerbations. A study was undertaken to
investigate whether severe acute exacerbations of COPD exert a
direct effect on mortality.
Methods: Multivariate techniques were used to analyse the
prognostic influence of acute exacerbations of COPD treated in
hospital (visits to the emergency service and admissions), patient
age, smoking, body mass index, co-morbidity, long term oxygen
therapy, forced spirometric parameters, and arterial blood gas
tensions in a prospective cohort of 304 men with COPD followed up
for 5 years. The mean (SD) age of the patients was 71 (9) years and
forced expiratory volume in 1 second was 46 (17)%.
Results: Only older age (hazard ratio (HR) 5.28, 95% CI 1.75 to
15.93), arterial carbon dioxide tension (HR 1.07, 95% CI 1.02 to
1.12), and acute exacerbations of COPD were found to be
independent indicators of a poor prognosis. The patients with the
greatest mortality risk were those with three or more acute COPD
exacerbations (HR 4.13, 95% CI 1.80 to 9.41).
Conclusions: This study shows for the first time that severe acute
exacerbations of COPD have an independent negative impact on
patient prognosis. Mortality increases with the frequency of severe
exacerbations, particularly if these require admission to hospital.
