Abstract
Background: Infection with bacteria such as Pseudomonas is
common in lung allograft recipients, particularly during chronic
rejection. Analysis of sputum samples from patients with cystic
fibrosis infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Burkholderia
cepacia has indicated the presence of bacterial N-acylhomoserine
lactones (AHLs) quorum sensing signalling molecules. AHLs not
only control the expression of bacterial virulence genes but are also
involved in stimulating the maturation of antibiotic resistant
biofilms and host chemokine release. It was hypothesised that AHLs
may be detected even in clinically stable lung transplant recipients
free of clinical infection or rejection.
Methods: Three 60 ml samples of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)
fluid were taken from nine stable lung transplant recipients 3–12
months after transplantation. Detection of AHLs was carried out on
dichloromethane extracted supernatants using the bioluminescence
based AHL reporter plasmid pSB1075. This responds to the presence
of AHLs with long acyl chains (C10–C14), generating light.
Synthetic AHLs were included as positive controls.
Results: Five of the nine BAL fluid supernatants exhibited AHL
activity, suggesting the presence of AHLs with long N-acyl chains.
There was no correlation between the levels of AHLs detected or
their absence and BAL fluid microbiology or diagnosis before
transplantation.


Conclusions: This is the first evidence for the presence of AHL
quorum sensing signals in human lung allograft recipients, even in
subjects with no rejection or apparent infection. Further
longitudinal follow up of these preliminary findings is required to
elucidate potential links with infection, rejection, and allograft
deterioration.
