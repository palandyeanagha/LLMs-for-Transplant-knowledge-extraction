Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV), associated with 
Merkel cell carcinoma, was detected in 27 of 635 nasopha￾ryngeal aspirate samples by real-time PCR. MCPyV was 
more commonly found in adults than in children. Presence 
in the upper respiratory tract may be a general property of 
human PyVs.
Polyomaviruses (PyVs) are highly prevalent, small 
DNA viruses, capable of persistence in the host. To 
date, 5 human PyVs have been described: JC (JCPyV), BK 
(BKPyV), KI (KIPyV), WU (WUPyV), and Merkel cell 
(MCPyV). The discovery of KIPyV and WUPyV in respi￾ratory tract samples has led to many studies of the role of 
these viruses in respiratory tract disease (1–4). Moreover, 
JCPyV and BKPyV viral DNA has been detected in tonsils 
(5,6), and BKPyV has been found in respiratory tract secre￾tions (7). MCPyV was reported in 2008 and was identifi ed 
in Merkel cell tumors, a rare form of skin cancer (8). We 
hypothesized that presence in the upper respiratory tract is 
a trait shared by all human PyVs and investigated whether 
MCPyV could also be found in respiratory secretions.
The Study
We used 635 of 637 NPA extracts that had been col￾lected and stored as part of a previous study. Two extracts 
were insuffi cient for analysis. A total of 340 samples were 
from children (median age 5 months, range 10 days–3 
years), and 295 samples were from adults (median age 59 
years, range 16–93 years). The samples had been sent to 
Karolinska University Hospital for diagnosis of respira￾tory tract infections in 2004–2005. Patient identifi ers were 
removed, and the only available clinical information was 
the patient’s age and sex, month of sampling, and name of 
referring clinic.
An initial screening by nested PCR with the published 
MCPyV primer sets LT3, LT1, and VP1 (8) identifi ed a 
strongly positive sample, NPA370, that was used as a posi￾tive control for subsequent experiments. Two hydrolysis 
probe–based, real-time PCRs (rtPCRs) were designed to 
target the large T antigen (LT) gene and the capsid VP1 gene 
of MCPyV. Primers and probe targeting the LT gene were 
(LT.1F) 5′-CCACAGCCAGAGCTCTTCCT-3′, (LT.1R) 
5′-TGGTGGTCTCCTCTCTGCTACTG-3′, and (LT 
probe) 5′-FAM-TCCTTCTCAGCGTCCCAGGCTTCA￾TAMRA-3′. The resulting amplicon was 146 bp. Prim￾ers and probe targeting the VP1 gene were (VP1.1F) 
5′-TGCCTCCCACATCTGCAAT-3′, (VP1.1R) 5′-
GTGTCTCTGCCAATGCTAAATGA-3′, and (VP1 probe) 
5′-6FAM-TGTCACAGGTAATATC-MGBNFQ-3′. The 
resulting amplicon was 59 bp. Reactions were performed 
in 20 μL of 1×TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Ap￾plied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), 900 nmol/L of 
LT.1 primers or 450 nmol/L of VP1.1 primers, 250 nmol/L 
of LT probe or 500 nmol/L of VP1 probe, and 5 μL of tem￾plate. Cycling conditions were 50°C for 2 min, 95°C for 10 
min, 45 cycles at 95°C for 5 s, and 60°C (LT assay) or 58°C 
(VP1 assay) for 1 min in a Roche Lightcycler 480 (Roche, 
Basel, Switzerland).
Due to a limited amount of the positive sample 
NPA370, control plasmids were constructed for both assays 
by cloning amplicons of NPA370 into pCR4-TOPO (Invit￾rogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA): pMCPyVLT.1 containing a 
258-bp LT gene amplicon (FJ472933) and pMCPyVVP1.1 
containing a 179-bp VP1 gene amplicon (FJ472932). Se￾rial dilutions of the plasmids were used to determine as￾say sensitivity, and pMCPyVLT.1 was also used to deter￾mine a genome copy number correlate for the LT assay. 
In both assays, plasmid control with 2 copies/reaction was 
reproducibly positive, corresponding to 400 copies/mL of 
sample. Specifi city of both assays was assessed by a range 
of templates: a plasmid containing the complete KIPyV ge￾nome; a WUPyV-positive sample NPA213; 4 urine sam￾ples positive for either BKPyV or JCPyV; and a panel of 
samples containing respiratory syncytial virus, infl uenza A 
and B viruses, adenovirus, bocavirus, parainfl uenza virus, 
metapneumovirus, herpes simplex virus type 1 and 2, va￾ricella-zoster virus, human herpesvirus 6, parvovirus B19, 
cytomegalovirus, echovirus 30, Mycoplasma pneumonie, 
Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophila. 
All the above samples were negative by LT and VP1 as￾says. To check for contamination, we included at least 4 
water controls per run of 10–86 samples; no amplifi cation 
was observed.
Of the 635 NPA samples, 44 (6.9%) were positive for 
MCPyV DNA by the LT assay, 84 (13.2%) were positive 
by the VP1 assay, and 27 (4.3%) were positive by both as￾says. With a few exceptions, viral DNA copy numbers were 
low, as determined by cycle threshold values (mean LT/
VP1 = 38.6/39.0) and plasmid equivalent counts of the LT 
assay (Table). To further validate these fi ndings, 10 dou￾ble-positive samples and all LT-positive (+)/VP1-negative

(–) samples were amplifi ed by conventional PCR using the 
LT primers. All double-positive samples gave the expected 
146-bp product, which was confi rmed to have MCPyV se￾quence (FJ472034–43), but the LT+/VP1– samples did not 
generate specifi c products. Whether this was due to lower 
sensitivity of the conventional PCR or occasional unspecif￾ic amplifi cation in the LT rtPCR could not be determined. 
The VP1 PCR product was too short to enable direct se￾quencing. Therefore, only samples positive by both assays 
were considered positive for MCPyV.
By these criteria, 25 of 295 samples from adults and 
2 of 340 samples from children were positive. Therefore, 
signifi cantly more adults than children were MCPyV posi￾tive (p<0.001, χ2
 test). MCPyV was particularly prevalent 
among the elderly. The median age for MCPyV carriers 
was 74 years. A skew in gender in MCPyV carriers was 
not statistically signifi cant. None of the MCPyV-positive 
samples were positive for KIPyV or WUPyV.
Conclusions
MCPyV DNA was detected in 4.3% of NPA samples 
from patients with respiratory disease as determined by 
combined results of 2 rtPCRs. Viral DNA was detected in 
low copy numbers, which makes reproducibility of posi￾tive results challenging (9). Therefore, a prevalence rate of 
4.3% is probably an underestimation of samples contain￾ing MCPyV DNA at concentrations below the reproducible 
detection limit. A similar result of discordant LT and VP1 
positive Merkel cell tumor samples has been reported (8). 
Contamination by the plasmid template is unlikely because 
water controls were consistently negative and LT and VP1 
positivity were signifi cantly associated (p<0.001, χ2
 test). 
Notably, both assays were easily reproducible for the 5 
samples that had relatively high copy numbers (Table).
The prevalence of MCPyV in this collection of NPA 
samples is higher than that of KIPyV and WUPyV (10). 
Also, signifi cantly more adults (particularly the elderly) 
were MCPyV positive than were children. This result is in 
contrast to results with KIPyV and WUPyV, which have 
mainly been found in children (1,2). Possible reasons for 
this age-related prevalence include incidence increases with 
exposure time, activation of latent virus increases with age, 
and possible previous exposure to transmission of MCPyV 
that is no longer in effect (11). Alternatively, a larger num￾ber of adult patients may be immunosuppressed than are the 
children. However, most MCPyV-positive samples (22/27) 
were sent for infl uenza diagnostics from the infectious dis￾eases unit, not a hematology or oncology unit; hence, pa￾tients were probably not severely immunosuppressed.
The presence of MCPyV in respiratory secretions in￾dicates that it is shed into the respiratory tract or present in 
cells of the respiratory tract, similar to KIPyV, WUPyV, 
BKPyV, and possibly JCPyV. Its presence also suggests 
that the respiratory tract may be a route of transmission. 
The use of stored nucleic acid extracts did not allow us to 
determine whether detected MCPyV DNA was intracellu￾lar or virion-associated. Thus, the newly discovered human 
PyVs can all be found in the respiratory tract. Conclusions 
about their primary target organs and pathogenicity cannot 
be drawn without epidemiologic support and further inves￾tigation on different sample types.
