Mice carrying the recessive locus for peripheral T cell deficiency (Ptcd ) have a block in thymic egress, but the mechanism
responsible is undefined. Here we found that Ptcd T cells had an intrinsic migration defect, impaired lymphoid tissue trafficking
and irregularly shaped protrusions. Characterization of the Ptcd locus showed a point substitution of lysine for glutamic acid
at position 26 in the actin regulator coronin 1A that enhanced its inhibition of the actin regulator Arp2/3 and resulted in its
mislocalization from the leading edge of migrating T cells. The discovery of another coronin 1A mutant during an N-ethyl-N￾nitrosourea-mutagenesis screen for T cell–lymphopenic mice prompted us to evaluate a T cell–deficient, B cell–sufficient
and natural killer cell–sufficient patient with severe combined immunodeficiency, whom we found had mutations in both
CORO1A alleles. Our findings establish a function for coronin 1A in T cell egress, identify a surface of coronin involved in
Arp2/3 regulation and demonstrate that actin regulation is a biological process defective in human and mouse severe
combined immunodeficiency.
After developing in the thymus, mature thymocytes upregulate sphin￾gosine 1-phosphate receptor type 1 (S1P1) and exit into the circulation
to populate the naive T cell compartment. S1P1 and its ligand,
sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), are required for the egress of mature
thymocytes1. FTY720, a small-molecule immunosuppressant being
tested in clinical trials for the treatment of autoimmune disease,
inhibits egress by modulating S1P1 function1. Beyond the requirement
for S1P1, little is understood about how T cells migrate from
the thymus.
The cataract Shionogi (CTS) strain was initially isolated in the
1960s from a closed colony of ICR mice on the basis of its cataracts
and microphthalmia2. The CTS strain was later established to have a
defect in thymic egress3 after it failed to reject major histocompat￾ibility complex–disparate skin grafts4. The nature of this recessive
defect, called ‘peripheral T cell deficiency’ (Ptcd), and its function in
thymic egress have remained unclear.
Coronins are actin regulators found in all eukaryotes5. In addition
to binding F-actin, coronin proteins associate with and inhibit the
nucleation-promoting Arp2/3 complex. Seven coronin family mem￾bers exist in mammals, including coronin 1A (Coro1A), which is
expressed mainly in hematopoietic cells. Coro1A-deficient mice have
fewer peripheral T cells due to more apoptosis6,7, and one study has
attributed this to an excessive accumulation of F-actin6. T cell
migration is also reported to be defective6,7, but this has been called
into question8. Those last authors have also questioned whether
Coro1A deficiency alters F-actin dynamics and instead link the greater
apoptosis to a T cell antigen receptor (TCR) signaling defect8. These
conflicting reports of Coro1A-deficient mice have complicated the
understanding of the function of this actin regulator in T cell biology.
Here we report that Ptcd T cells had an intrinsic migration defect
that impaired thymic egress and trafficking through lymph nodes. We
‘narrowed’ the Ptcd locus and identified a point mutation in the gene
encoding Coro1A (Coro1a) that resulted in mislocalization of the
protein in T cells and greater inhibition of Arp2/3 by Coro1A in
biochemical assays. In a parallel effort to identify additional traffic￾king mutants by screening mice carrying N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea
(ENU)-induced mutations for altered peripheral T cell numbers, we
identified a strain with 90% less Coro1A and a phenotype similar to
that of Coro1A-knockout mice. Comparison of Ptcd and Coro1A￾deficient T cells allowed us to separate the defect in TCR-induced

calcium signaling from the diminished thymocyte survival. In addi￾tion to yielding new alleles of Coro1a, our mouse forward-genetics
approach led us to identify a T cell–deficient, B cell–sufficient and
natural killer cell–sufficient (T–B+NK+) patient with SCID who has
Coro1A deficiency.
RESULTS
Ptcd is an intrinsic T cell–migration defect
To characterize the cellular basis of the Ptcd defect, we first backcrossed
the Ptcd locus onto the C57BL/6 (B6) strain and confirmed the accu￾mulation of mature single-positive (SP) thymocytes (CD69loCD62Lhi)
and associated lower number of peripheral T cells (Fig. 1a and Supple￾mentary Fig. 1 online). Irradiated wild-type mice that had been
reconstituted with Ptcd bone marrow cells also had an accumulation
of mature thymocytes and few circulating T cells (Fig. 1b), whereas
reciprocal bone marrow chimeras did not have such defects (Supple￾mentary Fig. 2 online). These results localized the Ptcd defect to a
hematopoietic lineage–derived cell and indicated that impaired egress
of mature thymocytes from the thymus is a pathogenic mechanism.
Although normal amounts of S1P1 were expressed on Ptcd mature
SP thymocytes (Fig. 1c), S1P1 function was impaired. In Transwell
migration assays, Ptcd mature CD4 SP thymocytes were less efficient
in migrating toward S1P than were cells from control heterozygous
littermates (Fig. 1d). The cells also migrated less efficiently toward the
chemokines CCL21 and CXCL12. The response of Ptcd CD4+CD8+
double-positive thymocytes to CXCL12 was similarly lower (Fig. 1e),
and the migration of naive Ptcd splenic T cells was impaired, whereas
B cells migrated normally (Fig. 1f). The expression of CCR7 and
CXCR4, the respective chemokine receptors that recognize CCL21 and
CXCL12, was similar in Ptcd and control cells (Supplementary Fig. 3
online). These results indicate that T cells in Ptcd mice have a general,
cell-intrinsic migration defect that impairs S1P1 responsiveness and
blocks thymic egress.
Ptcd T cells have entry, egress and motility defects
To test for peripheral trafficking defects, we transferred Ptcd and
control T cells together into wild-type recipients. At 1 h after transfer,
the ratio of Ptcd T cells to control T cells was lower in peripheral and

mesenteric lymph nodes and higher in blood (Fig. 2a), which
indicated that Ptcd cells were less efficient in entering lymph nodes.
Next we tested lymph node egress with two approaches. First, we
transferred Ptcd and control T cells together at a ratio of 3:1 to achieve
equal proportions in the lymph nodes. At 24 h after transfer, we found
a much lower proportion of Ptcd cells in lymph than in lymph nodes
(Fig. 2b), which was consistent with a diminished ability to exit
into lymph. As an additional approach, we assessed the retention of
Ptcd T cells in lymph nodes. After transferring Ptcd and control T cells,
we blocked entry into lymph nodes for 20 h with integrin-neutralizing
antibodies. Roughly 60% of Ptcd T cells were retained in the
lymph nodes, compared with just 20% of control T cells (Fig. 2c).
These results collectively demonstrate that Ptcd T cells are defective
in exiting lymph nodes.
Two-photon microscopy of explanted lymph nodes from mice that
had received fluorescence-labeled cells showed that whereas control
cells moved at a median velocity of 9.5 mm/min, Ptcd cells moved at a
lower median velocity of 6.6 mm/min (Fig. 2d and Supplementary
Movie 1 online). In addition, Ptcd cells had larger turning angles
(Fig. 2e), indicative of less-directed paths, and the cells failed to
efficiently displace over time (Fig. 2f). These results demonstrate that
in addition to blocking thymic egress, the Ptcd defect impairs
trafficking through lymph nodes.
Coro1a is mutated at the Ptcd locus
The Ptcd locus has been mapped to a 10.9-megabase region of
chromosome 7 containing over 300 open reading frames9. To refine
the locus, we did a mapping cross between CTS and B6 mice, using
thymocyte accumulation to phenotype mice (Fig. 3a). We noted that
the cataracts and microphthalmia were present in F1 hybrids
and failed to segregate together with the recessive Ptcd trait
(data not shown), consistent with an early report that these eye traits
are autosomal dominant10. After analyzing over 900 meiosis events,
we further mapped the Ptcd locus to a critical interval of 950 kilobases
(Fig. 3b). This gene-rich interval contained 37 open reading frames,
including Coro1a (Supplementary Fig. 4 online). Coro1a was a likely
candidate gene for Ptcd because of its abundance in T cells11 and the
association of coronin family molecules with actin-based motility5
.
Sequencing of Ptcd DNA showed a G-to-A mutation in exon 2 of
Coro1a (Fig. 3c), which resulting in a nonconservative glutamic
acid–to lysine substitution at residue 26 in the b-propeller domain
of the protein (Coro1AE26K; Fig. 3d). This residue was conserved in all
annotated Coro1A sequences and the charge of the residue was also
conserved in a large number of orthologs (Supplementary Fig. 5
online) and was in a surface-exposed loop12 adjacent to a region that
in the close relative Coro1B has been indicated to be an actin-binding
site13. Immunoblot analysis showed that the abundance of Coro1A in
total thymocytes did not vary between Ptcd and controls (Fig. 3e).
To exclude the possibility that substitutions other than Coro1AE26K
were responsible for the Ptcd phenotype, we tested for genetic
complementation by crossing Ptcd mice with Coro1a+/– mice. As
expected, the Coro1a wild-type allele complemented Ptcd defects
in T cell lymphopenia and F-actin accumulation, whereas the
Coro1a-null allele failed to complement (Supplementary Fig. 6a,b
online). In addition, mature thymocyte numbers were slightly higher
in Ptcd/– mice than in Ptcd/+ mice (Supplementary Fig. 6c).
Although these studies do not exclude the possibility that the
Ptcd interval contains additional genetic modifiers, the inability of
the Coro1a-null allele to ‘rescue’ several of the Ptcd defects provides
strong evidence that the Coro1AE26K substitution results in the
Ptcd phenotype.
ENU-mutant Koyaanisqatsi is a Coro1A hypomorph
In parallel to the studies reported above, we did an ENU-mutagenesis
screen to identify regulators of lymphocyte trafficking and egress. We
initially identified ‘Koyaanisqatsi’ (Koy) as a recessive mutant strain of
mice with a circulating T cell deficiency (Fig. 4a). Further character￾ization of Koy mice showed that they had fewer mature thymocytes
and peripheral T cells (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig. 7 online). In
Transwell migration assays, Koy thymocytes and naive T cells migrated

much less efficiently than did cells from littermate control mice
(Fig. 4c). These findings in Koy mice, along with more phalloidin
staining of Koy mature thymocytes (Fig. 4d), resembled those
reported for Coro1a–/– mice generated by gene targeting6. After
sequencing Koy DNA, we identified an A-to-T substitution in exon
7 of Coro1a (Fig. 4e) that resulted in an aspartic acid–to–valine
substitution at residue 278. This residue is located at a contact surface
predicted to be critical for the proper assembly and stability of
Coro1A12, and immunoblot analysis of total thymocytes showed
that Koy cells had roughly one tenth as much Coro1A as wild-type
cells had (Fig. 4f). These data indicate that Koy is a hypomorphic
mutant of Coro1A.

Survival and Ca2+ flux of Coro1A mutants
Direct comparison of Ptcd, Koy and Coro1a–/– mice confirmed that the
E26K substitution was not a phenocopy of the Coro1A-deficient state.
Although Ptcd mutants had an accumulation of mature thymocytes
(Fig. 1a), Coro1A-deficient mice had fewer mature thymocytes
(Fig. 4b) due to reduced cell survival6. Analysis of cell viability by
measurement of loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (Fig. 5a)
and annexin V staining (Fig. 5b) showed that mature thymocytes
from Ptcd mice were similar to those from wild-type control mice,
whereas mature thymocytes from Coro1a–/– mice were less viable.
However, Ptcd splenic T cells had a survival defect similar to that of
Coro1a–/– cells (Fig. 5a,b).
A published study has attributed the survival defect of Coro1a–/–
T cells to ‘downstream’ effects of excessive accumulation of F-actin6.
Consistent with that interpretation, mature Ptcd thymocytes had only
slightly more F-actin, as assessed by phalloidin staining (Fig. 5c),
whereas mature Coro1a–/– thymocytes and the similarly apoptosis￾prone Ptcd and Coro1a–/– splenic T cells all had approximately twofold
more phalloidin staining (Fig. 5c). However, the correlation between
F-actin accumulation and less viability did not seem to hold true for
Ptcd/– T cells, as they had more phalloidin staining similar to that of
Coro1a–/– T cells and yet were not fewer in number in the thymus
(Supplementary Fig. 6). A study has suggested that the lower viability
of Coro1a–/– cells reflects a requirement for Coro1A in TCR-induced
Ca2+ flux rather than in F-actin regulation8
. However, Ptcd and
Coro1A-deficient mature CD4 SP thymocytes showed similar defects
in Ca2+ flux after CD3 crosslinking (Fig. 5d). Furthermore, both Ptcd
and Coro1A-deficient cells showed minimal defects compared with
wild-type cells after combined crosslinking of CD3 and CD4 (Fig. 5d),
a treatment that may more closely mimic major histocompatibility
complex class II–peptide engagement14. These findings dissociate the
function of Coro1A in TCR-induced Ca2+ signaling from its func￾tion in thymocyte viability but leave unclear whether Coro1A acts
through F-actin regulation or by some other mechanism to promote
T cell survival.
Coro1AE26K is mislocalized in Ptcd T cells
Coro1B regulates F-actin dynamics at the leading edge of migrating
fibroblasts15, and we found that in migrating wild-type T cells,
Coro1A was situated in F-actin-rich and Arp2/3-rich leading-edge
protrusions (Fig. 6a,b). The distribution of Coro1AE26K in migrating
Ptcd T cells was considerably altered and little of the protein could be
detected at the leading edge (Fig. 6a), whereas Arp2/3 continued to
concentrate in this region (Fig. 6b). Coro1AE26K also similarly mis￾localized when expressed in fibroblasts (Supplementary Fig. 8 online),
which indicated an intrinsic failure to distribute at the leading edge.
Real-time live cell imaging showed that protrusions from migrating
Ptcd T cells were irregularly shaped and often larger in size than

protrusions from wild-type cells, consistent with a failure to
properly regulate the actin cytoskeleton (Fig. 6c and Supplementary
Movies 2–4 online). We noted similarly dysmorphic protrusions
from Ptcd/– compound mutant T cells (Supplementary Fig. 6d).
The short in vitro survival of Coro1A-deficient T cells made
assessments difficult, but these cells seemed more severely compro￾mised in their migration than Ptcd T cells were (Supplementary
Movie 5 online). These results collectively establish that Coro1AE26K
fails to distribute correctly in migrating T cells and that the cells have
aberrant shape regulation.
Coro1AE26K enhances Arp2/3 inhibition
To understand the biochemical effect of the E26K substitution, we first
assessed the ability of Coro1A to bind F-actin. In cosedimentation
assays, Coro1AE26K associated normally with F-actin (Fig. 6d). In
contrast, Arp2/3 coimmunoprecipitated more Coro1AE26K than wild￾type Coro1A from cell lysates (Fig. 6e). The corresponding substitu￾tion in Coro1B also resulted in more association with Arp2/3
(Supplementary Fig. 9 online). Consistent with more interaction
with Arp2/3, Coro1AE26Kwas more efficient than wild-type Coro1A in
inhibiting Arp2/3 activity in actin-polymerization assays (Fig. 6f).
To examine how this biochemical gain-of-function substitution
manifested as a recessive Ptcd allele, we analyzed T cells from Ptcd/+
and Ptcd/– mice. As expected, the Coro1A distribution in Ptcd/–
T cells (Fig. 6g) was similar to that in Ptcd/Ptcd T cells (Fig. 6a). In
Ptcd/+ T cells, Coro1A was both present at and mislocalized away
from the leading edge (Fig. 6g). These results suggest that in Ptcd/+
cells, wild-type Coro1A can access the leading edge to regulate actin
dynamics. In summary, these biochemical studies indicate that the
highly conserved Glu26 residue in Coro1A is important for the
regulation of Arp2/3.
Coro1A is deficient in a T–B+NK+ patient with SCID
After finding that point mutations in Coro1a resulted in severe
T lymphopenia in both Ptcd and Koy mice, we sought to determine
whether CORO1A mutations could also be responsible for human
cases of primary T cell immunodeficiency with undefined etiologies.
Thus, we sequenced CORO1A in DNA from 16 SCID patients lacking
mutations in previously recognized genes associated with T–B+NK+
SCID. Although we failed to detect any CORO1A mutations in 15
samples, we did identify a single patient with a two-nucleotide
deletion in exon 3 (deletion of CT between nucleotides 248 and 249
in the coding DNA sequence; Fig. 7a) that resulted in a frame shift and
premature stop codon in the area encoding the Coro1A b-propeller
domain (with the first amino acid affected by the frame shift being a
substitution of arginine for proline at position 83, and the creation of
a new reading frame that ended at the first stop codon at position 10
(with arginine now amino acid 1)). Consistent with a destabilizing
truncation, immunoblot analysis of Epstein Barr virus (EBV)-immor￾talized B lymphoid cell lines derived from the patient’s peripheral
blood showed an absence of Coro1A protein (Fig. 7b). When this
patient was 13 months old, she was hospitalized with a severe varicella
infection after vaccination; she was later diagnosed as an atypical
T–B+NK+ patient with SCID and was treated by allogeneic bone
marrow transplantation. We found that her father was heterozygous
for the two–base pair deletion in CORO1A but her mother and sister
were not (Fig. 7a).
To assess the gene-copy number of CORO1A in the patient, we did
quantitative PCR of genomic DNA with nonoverlapping primers
spanning intron 1 through exon 11 of CORO1A and noted 50% less
product relative to that of a healthy control (Fig. 7c). In contrast,
signals for the human genes encoding S1P1, on chromosome 1, and
coronin 7, located telomeric to CORO1A on chromosome 16p, did
not differ from the quantitative PCR signal in control cells. Along with
reports of copy-number variation in chromosome 16p11.2, where
CORO1A is located16–18, these data suggest that our patient, who
inherited a two–base pair paternal deletion in one allele of CORO1A,
also has deletion of the other CORO1A allele.
DISCUSSION
Using a forward-genetics approach, we have identified a unique
Coro1a allele that allowed us to establish a requirement for this
actin-regulatory protein in the egress of T cells from the thymus
and lymph nodes. Two-photon microscopy showed that Coro1A was
needed for normal T cell motility in the lymph node, and in vitro
motility studies indicated its involvement in regulating cell shape.
Moreover, this mutation identified a site on Coro1A critical for Arp2/3
regulation and for controlling Coro1A distribution in the cell. Finally,
we demonstrated that Coro1A deficiency in a human was associated
with a peripheral T cell deficiency of sufficient severity to cause
T–B+NK+ SCID.
The identification of a critical function for Coro1A in egress from
the thymus and lymph nodes provides evidence that migration from
these tissues depends on proper regulation of Arp2/3-mediated actin
branching, most likely in response to S1P. The protein mDia1, a
member of the formin family of actin-nucleating proteins that
promote the formation of unbranched actin filaments, is also needed
for thymic egress19. Thus, the formation of both correctly branched as
well as unbranched actin networks seems to be required for exit from

this organ. The function of mDia1 in lymph node egress has not been
assessed. The small G proteins Rac and Cdc42 induce activation of the
Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein–Arp2/3 system and, consistent
with our results here, the Rac activator Dock2 is needed for lymph
node egress20. Although the function of Dock2 in thymic egress has
not been determined, given the need for Coro1A, we anticipate that
Dock2 is also involved. Lymphocyte protrusions initiate diapedesis21,
and our findings suggest that Coro1A-dependent control of actin may
be critical in the formation of protrusions during T cell egress.
The requirement for Arp2/3-mediated actin branching for T cell–
migration responses to chemoattractants has been supported by
findings obtained with cells deficient in Dock2, Wiskott-Aldrich
syndrome protein and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein–interacting
protein20,22,23 as well as Coro1A-deficient cells6,7. Our results obtained
with Ptcd T cells add to those findings and suggest an important
function for Coro1A-mediated Arp2/3 regulation in the control of
T cell shape. A published study has argued that F-actin dynamics are
unaltered in Coro1A-deficient T cells, although cell migration in
response to chemoattractants was not examined8. The basis for
these discrepant findings is unclear, but it seems possible that the
very poor survival of Coro1A-deficient naive T cells and their
consequent depletion from T cell preparations relative to effector
and/or memory T cells confounded some of the comparisons. In our
studies here, we were careful to exclude both dead cells and effector or
memory cells from our analysis of naive T cells. Although the
migration of Ptcd T cells was much lower in vitro and in the lymph
node, it was not absent, and this might explain the continued ability of
the Ptcd mouse thymus to organize into cortex and medulla3. It seems
likely that the lack of notable defects in Ptcd and Coro1A-deficient
B cells is due to redundancy with other coronin family members, and
this adds to other data establishing differences in requirements for
B cell and T cell motility19,24,25. Whether substitutions in Coro1A or
other actin-regulatory molecules cause defects in common lymphoid
progenitors remains to be determined. Although bone marrow chi￾mera–reconstitution efficiencies were similar for Ptcd and control
donors, our studies did not formally address whether the entry of early
thymic precursors is impaired. Future studies should include com￾petition assays with mixed–bone marrow chimeras to evaluate the
proportion of Ptcd-derived cells in bone marrow and thymus.
Leukocyte migration in lymphoid tissue has been described as phases
of force-generating actin protrusions followed by myosin-dependent
contractions26 that aid the squeezing of the cell nucleus through three￾dimensional matrices. In this context, it is notable that Ptcd T cells not
only had large and dysmorphic protrusions but also failed to elongate
their nuclei. Thus, remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton by Coro1A
may contribute to both protrusion and contraction during the
migration of T cells through lymphoid tissues.
The mechanism by which coronin proteins inhibit Arp2/3-
mediated actin branching is complex and incompletely understood.
Although several studies have shown that coronin proteins are able to
directly bind Arp2/3 and possibly inhibit function before F-actin
binds27,28, work with Coro1B in fibroblasts suggests that it acts by
displacing Arp2/3 from actin branch points29. We have demonstrated
that a Coro1A surface proximal to the predicted F-actin-binding
region13 was involved in Arp2/3 regulation. Our findings emphasize
the importance of characterizing the highly conserved Glu26-
containing surface of the type I coronin subfamily in future struc￾ture-function studies focusing on how an oligomeric coronin complex
dislodges Arp2/3 from F-actin. The failure of Coro1AE26K to localize
normally to the leading edge of migrating cells has identified what may
be another level of coronin regulation. Further studies are needed to
determine whether interactions with the cofilin phosphatase slingshot5
or other still-unknown coronin-binding partners are altered by
the substitution.
Coro1A deficiency caused a substantial defect in T cell survival, but
the basis for this effect is not yet resolved. Although the Ptcd is an
important allelic comparison that ‘disconnected’ the survival and
Ca2+-flux defects, the greater phalloidin staining of Ptcd/– mature
thymocytes also failed to support the idea of a simple correlation
between survival and F-actin accumulation. The possibility remains
that Coro1A directly affects cell survival independently of effects on
F-actin, and analysis of additional Coro1A substitutions may yield
new allelic insights. The continued ability of Ptcd thymocytes to
maintain nearly normal total cellular F-actin despite mislocalization
of Coro1A might be explained by an ongoing association of low but
sufficient amounts of Coro1AE26K to achieve partial regulation of
Arp2/3 at the leading edge, or it might reflect correspondingly greater
actin-debranching and depolymerization in the cell body. Alterna￾tively, the in vitro assay for examining colocalization of Arp2/3 and
Coro1A may not accurately reflect how these proteins distribute
in vivo in migrating thymocytes. The similar partial deficiencies in
TCR-induced Ca2+ flux in Coro1AE26K and Coro1a–/– T cells are in
agreement with emerging evidence that an intact actin cytoskeleton is
important for Ca2+ flux30. However, our finding that CD3-CD4 co￾crosslinking led to equivalent Ca2+ flux in wild-type, Coro1AE26K and
Coro1a–/– thymocytes, along with a published report of normal
proliferation of Coro1a–/– T cells stimulated by antigen-presenting
cells6, suggests that Coro1A may have a limited function in TCR
signaling during encounters with cognate antigen. We anticipate that
single-cell analysis of the release of Ca2+ stores and the activity of Ca2+
release–activated channels in Ptcd and Coro1A-deficient mature thy￾mocytes and T cells, along with similar studies of T cells with other
defects in actin-regulatory proteins, will add to the understanding of
how the actin cytoskeleton contributes to calcium signaling.
An important challenge of studies of mouse models is ‘translation’
of the findings to humans. The identification of a patient with a
peripheral T cell deficiency who lacks expression of Coro1A suggests
that Coro1A has similar functions in humans and mice. Although the
human X-linked Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome has long associated actin
biology with hematopoietic cell dysfunction, the Coro1A-deficient
patient we studied here allowed us to link regulation of the actin
cytoskeleton with SCID31. T–B+NK+ SCID has been defined before by
mutations resulting in impaired TCR or interleukin 7 receptor
signaling32. Other forms of SCID involve defects in purine metabo￾lism, DNA recombination or cytokine signaling33. Mutations in genes
involved in these pathways result in apoptosis through purine toxicity,
deficient cytokine signaling or failure to rearrange a signaling-compe￾tent antigen receptor. Given the results of our study of Coro1A
deficiency, we can also include apoptosis via actin dysregulation as a
cause of SCID. A report classifying a Coro1a-null allele as an auto￾immune-suppression locus in mice7 is consistent with the idea that
Coro1A defects cause immunodeficiency. We predict that substitu￾tions in other hematopoietic cell–specific actin-associated molecules
will be found to cause SCID. Because the pericentromeric segment of
human chromosome 16 that contains CORO1A is prone to copy￾number variation16–18, we also anticipate that additional cases of
patients with lower T cell function will involve CORO1A mutations.

from Jackson Laboratories. Cataract-Shionogi (CTS/Shi) mice were from TGC.
Ptcd was backcrossed six to ten generations onto the B6 strain with single￾nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers as described below. Coro1a–/– mice,
which were backcrossed ten generations with B6 mice, were generated as
described6. Koy mice were identified by an ENU-mutagenesis screen done as
described34 with B6 mice in a colony maintained at the Australian National
University. Male B6 mice were treated with three doses, 1 week apart, of 100 mg
ENU (Sigma) per kg body weight in 10% (vol/vol) ethanol in citrate buffer,
pH 5.0, to produce G0 mice. After a refractory period of 8 weeks, these G0
males were mated with B6 females to generate G1 offspring. Two unrelated
G1 mice were crossed, producing G2 mice, which were then intercrossed to yield
G3 mice. Screening of these G3 mice by flow cytometry identified the Koy
phenotype. All mice were housed in specific pathogen–free conditions, and all
protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
of the University of California, San Francisco, or the Animal Experimentation
Ethics Committee of Australian National University. Bone marrow chimeras
were generated with 2  106 to 3  106 bone marrow cells from donor mice
transplanted intravenously into lethally irradiated congenic host mice.
Chimeras were given prophylactic water containing antibiotics and were
analyzed 8–12 weeks after transplantation.
Flow cytometry, intracellular staining and measurement of Ca2+ flux.
Polyclonal antibody to S1P1 (anti-S1P1) has been described35. Phalloidin–
fluorescein isothiocyanate was from Sigma. Indo-1 was from Invitrogen. Kits
for intracellular staining and annexin V staining were from BD Biosciences. The
JC-1 mitochondrial membrane potential assay kit was from Cayman. All other
antibodies used for flow cytometry were from BD Biosciences, Invitrogen,
eBiosciences or BioLegend. Ca2+-flux assays were adapted from published
methods for thymocytes14. Cells were loaded for 30 min at 30 1C with Indo-1 in
the presence of biotinylated anti-CD3 (2C11; BD), fluorescein isothiocyanate–
anti-CD8 (53-6.7; BD) and Alexa Fluor 647–anti-CD4 (M4-5; BD). Thymo￾cytes were additionally stained with phycoerythrin–anti-CD62L (Mel14; BD)
and splenocytes were additionally stained with phycoerythrin–anti-CD44 (IM7;
BD). Cells were washed and kept on ice until analysis. For crosslinking of CD3
and CD4, cells were additionally pretreated for 5 min with biotinylated anti￾CD4 (RM4-4; BD). Cells were mixed with prewarmed media containing
propidium iodide for exclusion of dead cells and were warmed to 37 1C.
Baseline Ca2+ concentrations were assessed for 30 s before crosslinking with
streptavidin (50 mg/ml; Pierce). All flow cytometry was done on a FACSCalibur
or an LSRII (BD).
Purification of recombinant protein. Coronin recombinant protein was
expressed and purified with a mammalian expression system as described
for Coro1B15. Purified protein was quantified by absorbance at 280 nm and
the predicted extinction coefficients of 62,910 M–1cm–1 (Coro1A) and
65,890 M–1cm–1 (Coro1B).
Immunoprecipitation. Cells were washed twice with PBS and were lysed with a
KCl buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 100 mM KCl, 0.5% (vol/vol) Nonidet P-40,
1 mM EDTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg/ml of 1,10-phenan￾throline, 10 mg/ml of aprotinin, 10 mg/ml of leupeptin, 10 mM sodium fluoride
and 2 mM sodium orthovanadate). Lysates were cleared for 5 min at 13,000g
and were incubated with 0.5 mg primary antibody for 16 h at 4 1C, followed by
the addition of 20 ml of a slurry of ImmunoPure-immobilized protein A/G
beads (Pierce) and further incubation for an additional hour at 4 1C. Immune
complexes were collected, were washed three times with KCl buffer, were
separated by SDS-PAGE and were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride
membranes (Bio-Rad) for immunoblot analysis.
Actin-assembly assay. Arp2/3-nucleation reactions induced by the verprolin
homology, cofilin homology, acidic domain were done as described15: recom￾binant coronin and Arp2/3 (20 nM) were mixed in MKEI-50 buffer (20 mM
imidazole-KOH, pH 7.0, 50 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2 and 1 mM EGTA) and were
incubated for 5 min at 25 1C; reactions were initiated by the simultaneous
addition of 1.5 mM actin (5% labeled with pyrene, primed for 90 s with 1 mM
EGTA and 0.1 mM MgCl2) and 1 nM glutathione S-transferase–verprolin
homology, cofilin homology, acidic domain. The delay between mixing of
reactants and recording of fluorescence was 15 s. Fluorescence was converted to
the molar concentration of F-actin according to the fluorescence of completely
polymerized actin (24 h after reaction) and unpolymerized actin, with the
assumption a critical concentration of 0.1 mM.
Immunoblot analysis. Lysates from mouse thymocytes and human EBV￾immortalized cell lines were prepared in radioimmunoprecipitation buffer
(1% (vol/vol) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% (wt/vol) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% (vol/
vol) SDS, 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl and 0.02 NaN3) and were resolved
by PAGE (NuPage; Invitrogen), then were transferred (XCell; Invitrogen) to
Immobilon-FL membranes (Millipore), were blocked and probed with LICOR
buffer and were analyzed on an Odyssey infrared imager (LICOR). Anti-Coro1A
(07-493) was from Upstate Biotechnology, anti-actin (A2066) was from Sigma,
and secondary IRDye antibody (611-730-127) was from Rockland.
Transwell migration. Thymocytes and splenocytes collected in migration
medium (RPMI medium (Cellgro) supplemented with 10 mM HEPES,
pH 7.2 (Cellgro), 100 U/ml of penicillin-streptomycin (Cellgro) and 0.5%
(vol/vol) fatty acid–free BSA (Calbiochem)) were used for assays of migration
through Transwells (5 mm; Corning). For analysis of migration to S1P,
thymocytes were assayed immediately after isolation. For analysis of migration
to chemokines, thymocytes or splenocyte samples in which erythrocytes were
lysed were resensitized in migration media for 30 min at 37 1C. S1P (Sigma),
the human chemokine SDF-1a (Peprotech) and mouse CCL21 and CXCL13
(R&D Systems) were used at various concentrations.
Adoptive cell transfer and treatment. Thymocytes were labeled with the
cytosolic dye CFSE (carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl diester) or
CellTracker orange CMTMR ((5-(and-6)-(((4-chloromethyl)benzoyl)amino)-
tetramethylrhodamine); Molecular Probes) as described36. For adoptive transfer,
mice were injected intravenously with about 1  107 to 3  107 cells in about
0.3 ml media. For homing assays, mice were analyzed 1 h after transfer. For
assays of peripheral egress, mice were analyzed 24 h after transfer or were treated
intravenously for 20 h with entry-blocking antibodies and were analyzed after
44 h. Antibodies used for in vivo entry blockade have been described37.
Two-photon microscopy. Thymocytes from donor mice were isolated and were
labeled with CellTracker orange CMTMR (Invitrogen-Molecular Probes) as
described38, then were injected intravenously into B6 recipient mice along with
thymocytes from UBC-GFP mice. After 12–24 h, inguinal lymph nodes were
isolated for two-photon microscopy, and axillary and brachial lymph nodes
were isolated for flow cytometry. Flow cytometry confirmed that over 90% of
CMTMR+ cells in lymph nodes were mature SP thymocytes (CD4+CD8–
CD69loCD62Lhi or CD4–CD8+CD69loCD62Lhi). Explants were prepared as
described39. Inguinal lymph nodes were perfused with RPMI medium (Cellgro)
at 36–37 1C, were aerated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 and were imaged from the
cortical side of the lymph node through the capsule. A ‘custom’ two-photon
microscope system was used for imaging, with the 5-W MaiTai TiSapphire laser
(Spectra-Physics) tuned to an excitation wavelength of 890 nm. Images were
captured with Video Savant software (IO Industries). For time-lapse imagery,
30–36 planes 3 mm apart were collected every 20 s. Each xy plane spanned
240 mm  288 mm at a resolution 0.6 mm per pixel. Data were further processed
with MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices). Imaris software (Bitplane AG)
was used for three-dimensional volume rendering and cell tracking. Matlab
software was further used to calculate cell velocities, turning angles and
displacement. Statistical significance was evaluated with a paired two-tailed
Student’s t-test.
Genetic mapping, SNP analysis, human samples and sequencing. CTS/Shi
mice were crossed with B6 mice to generate an F1 generation. The Ptcd locus
was mapped with mutant F2 progeny of F1 intercrosses, F1 mice backcrossed to
nonparental CTS mice, or mutant F2 mice crossed with nonparental F1 mice.
Mice were phenotyped by analysis of thymocyte subset frequencies by flow
cytometry. Genomic DNA was isolated from tail tissue (Wizard Genomic kit;
Promega) and the Amplifluor HT kit (Chemicon, Millipore) and an ABI7300
(Applied Biosystems) were used according to the manufacturers’ instructions
for SNP reactions. Mapping SNPs were selected on the basis of polymorphisms
between B6 mice and BUB/J, a strain closely related to CTS/Shi. SNP primers
were designed on the AssayArchitect website. Patients with SCID and their

parents, where available, were enrolled with informed content in studies with
Institutional Review Board–approved protocols for determination of genotype
and genotype-phenotype correlations. Blood samples were immortalized with
EBV to create B cell lines. Human genomic DNA was isolated from buccal
swabs or EBV-immortalized lines with a Puregene kit (Gentra Systems). An
ABI7300 was used for quantitative PCR of genomic DNA. Human CORO1A
and mouse Coro1a exons and surrounding splice regions were amplified by
PCR from genomic DNA, were resequenced and were analyzed on 4Peaks
software (mekentosj) relative to the reference human genomic and cDNA
sequences NM_007074 and NM_007074.2, respectively (primers, Supplemen￾tary Table 1 online).
Brightfield and immunofluorescence microscopy. For fixed immunofluores￾cence imaging, 1  106 to 2  106 lymphocytes from peripheral and mesenteric
lymph nodes were seeded onto chambered coverslips (Lab-tek, Nunc) pre￾coated with recombinant mouse intercellular adhesion molecule 1–Fc fragment
(10 mg/ml; R&D Systems) and were allowed to settle and migrate for 1 h at
37 1C in the presence of CCL21 (1 mg/ml; R&D Systems) in RPMI medium
(Cellgro) supplemented with 1% (vol/vol) FCS (Invitrogen), 10 mM HEPES,
pH 7.2 (Cellgro) and 100 U/ml of penicillin-streptomycin. Cells were then fixed
with 4% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde (Sigma) and were made permeable with
0.5% (vol/vol) Triton-X100 (Sigma) in PBS. Coverslips were then stained with
a combination of the following: anti-Coro1A (rabbit polyclonal antibody;
07-493; Millipore, Upstate) or anti-p34Arc (rabbit polyclonal antibody to the
Arp2/3 subunit p34; 07-227; Millipore; Upstate), fluorescein isothiocyanate–
conjugated phalloidin (Sigma), Alexa Fluor 647–conjugated anti-CD4 (RM4-5;
BD), Alexa Fluor 647–conjugated anti-CD8 (53-6.7; BD), biotinylated
goat anti-rabbit (BD), streptavidin-indocarbocyanine (Jackson Immuno) or
4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Molecular Probes). The z-stacks were captured
on an Axiovert Z1 (Zeiss) and were deconvoluted with Axiovision Software
(Zeiss). For real-time imaging, 5  105 lymphocytes from peripheral and
mesenteric lymph nodes were stained with phycoerythrin-conjugated anti￾CD19 (1D3; BD) and Alexa Fluor 647–conjugated anti-CD4 and anti-CD8 and
were seeded on intercellular adhesion molecule–coated chambered coverslips
with CCL21 as described above with the addition of 0.1% (wt/vol) NuSieve
GTG Low Melt agarose (FMC BioProducts) and 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole.
Cells were maintained at 37 1C and 5% CO2 during the 3–4 h of imaging in an
environmentally controlled stage on an Axiovert Z1. Each 5-minute movie was
generated at time-lapse intervals of 10 s, with assembly of a z-stack at each time
point from six brightfield xy views with a z-step of 0.5 mm. After the time lapse,
a fluorescence image was captured to identify live T cells. Movies and images
were processed with Axiovision (Zeiss) and were exported for annotation and
splicing with AfterEffects (Adobe).
