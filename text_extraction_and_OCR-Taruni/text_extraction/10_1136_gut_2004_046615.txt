Background: Inflammatory bowel disease associated with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC-IBD) may
have a high prevalence of rectal sparing, backwash ileitis, and colorectal neoplasia.
Aims: To describe the clinical features and outcomes of PSC-IBD and compare these to a group of chronic
ulcerative colitis (CUC) patients.
Methods: The medical records of all patients with PSC-IBD evaluated at the Mayo Clinic Rochester between
1987 and 1992 were abstracted for information on endoscopic and histological features, colorectal
neoplasia, surgery, and other clinical outcomes. Patients referred for colorectal neoplasia and those who
did not undergo colonoscopy with biopsies were excluded. A control group of CUC patients matched for
sex, duration of IBD at first clinic visit, and calendar year of first clinic visit was identified, and similar
information was abstracted.
Results: Seventy one PSC-IBD patients and 142 CUC patients without PSC were identified. Rectal sparing
and backwash ileitis were more common in the PSC-IBD group (52% and 51%, respectively) than in
controls (6% and 7%, respectively). Overall, colorectal neoplasia developed in 18 cases and 15 controls,
including 11 cancers (seven cases and four controls). An increased risk of colorectal neoplasia or death
was not detected in a matched analysis. Although the cumulative incidence of colorectal neoplasia was
higher in cases (33%) than in controls (13%) at five years, this was of borderline statistical significance
(p = 0.054, unmatched log rank test). Overall survival from first clinic visit was significantly worse among
cases (79% v 97%) at five years (p,0.001, unmatched log rank test).
Conclusion: PSC-IBD is frequently characterised by rectal sparing and backwash ileitis. Colorectal
neoplasia develops in a substantial fraction and overall survival is worse. PSC-IBD may represent a distinct
IBD phenotype.
P
rimary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic chole￾static disease of unknown aetiology, characterised by
inflammation and fibrosis of the biliary tree.1–3 PSC may
eventually progress to hepatic cirrhosis and subsequent liver
failure, and is accompanied by an increased risk of
cholangiocarcinoma.4 5 PSC may occur in the presence or
absence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The prevalence
of IBD (typically chronic ulcerative colitis (CUC)) among PSC
patients is approximately 70–80% while only 2–7.5% of
patients with CUC will develop PSC.6
IBD associated with PSC (PSC-IBD) remains poorly
defined although at least one preliminary report has
suggested a high prevalence of pancolitis, with both rectal
sparing and ‘‘backwash ileitis’’.7 Higher rates of pouchitis
following proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis
(IPAA) have also been identified in this population of
patients.8 9 PSC may be an independent risk factor for
colorectal dysplasia or cancer in patients with CUC but the
magnitude of and mechanism of action for this potential risk
factor remains unclear.10–24 While several studies have shown
an increased prevalence of PSC or abnormal hepatic
biochemistries in patients with CUC who develop colorectal
neoplasia,10 12 or an increased risk of neoplasia among CUC
patients with PSC compared with those without,13 16 18–20 22 24
others have not.11 14 17 21 Differing sample sizes, end points,
and comparison groups may have contributed to these
disparate results.25 26 These distinguishing clinical features
between PSC-IBD and CUC suggest that PSC-IBD may be a
unique phenotype of IBD.
We addressed these issues by conducting a matched
case control cohort study comparing the endoscopic and
histological characteristics of IBD in a series of PSC-IBD
patients with a matched (two controls per case) group of CUC
patients without PSC. We also compared the cumulative
incidence of colorectal neoplasia, surgery, and overall survival
in these two groups.
METHODS
The Institutional Review Board of the Mayo Foundation
approved the study. A centralised diagnostic index was
utilised to identify all patients with PSC and concomitant IBD
(cases) evaluated at the Mayo Clinic Rochester between
January 1987 and December 1992, and their medical records
were reviewed. Conventional colonoscopic and histological
criteria were used to diagnose IBD. All cases were required to
have had at least one colonoscopy with biopsies at the Mayo
Clinic. Conventional radiographic criteria of beading, duct
ectasia, and stricturing of the intra- or extrahepatic bile ducts
were used to diagnose PSC.27 All patients were required to
have had a cholangiogram (either retrograde or percuta￾neous) performed or interpreted at the Mayo Clinic. Liver
biopsy findings or elevated hepatic biochemistries alone were
not sufficient for a diagnosis of PSC. Cases who had
undergone colectomy prior to a diagnosis of PSC or first
Mayo visit were excluded from the study. Likewise, cases that
had been diagnosed with colorectal dysplasia or cancer
elsewhere prior to evaluation at our institution were

excluded. The control group consisted of CUC patients
without PSC evaluated at the Mayo Clinic between 1976
and 1993. Controls were matched to cases for sex, calendar
year of first visit to the Mayo Clinic (¡10 years), and
duration of IBD prior to first visit (¡5 years).
This study was constructed as a matched case control
cohort design where PSC-IBD patients were considered cases
and CUC patients without PSC were controls. Both the case
and control patients were followed prospectively (through
their medical record) for colorectal neoplasia, surgery, and
death. This is in contrast, for example, with a retrospective
matched case control design where cases were identified as
patients with colorectal neoplasia and controls did not have
neoplasia.
Medical records were abstracted for the following data:
demographic information; duration, extent, and treatment of
IBD; duration, extent, and treatment of PSC; colorectal
neoplasia (dysplasia and cancer); surgical treatment for IBD;
surgical complications such as pouchitis and parastomal
varices; orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT); hepatobiliary
complications such as cholangiocarcinoma and hepatic fail￾ure; duration of follow up; vital status at last follow up; and
cause of death. Extent of colitis was defined as the most
proximal involvement of inflammatory disease based on
histology or endoscopy at any time during the study period.
Rectal sparing was rectal mucosa that was either endo￾scopically or histologically normal, or endoscopically and
histologically less inflamed than more proximal mucosa.
Backwash ileitis was defined endoscopically as a patulous
ileocaecal valve with increased granularity of the terminal
ileal mucosa. A normal ileal biopsy excluded the diagnosis of
backwash ileitis even if the above endoscopic findings were
noted. For patients diagnosed with ‘‘Crohn’s disease’’ (CD) or
‘‘indeterminate colitis’’ (IC), endoscopic and histological
features of all available colonoscopies or sigmoidoscopies
were re-reviewed for evidence of CD or IC.
The association of clinical characteristics which might have
an association with PSC case status was assessed by
conditional logistic regression models using a generalised
estimating equations approach in SAS procedure proportional
hazards regression (PHREG) to account for the potential
correlations within matched sets of cases and one or more
controls (using a simple modification of the SAS procedure
PHREG28).
For survival, cases were considered to be ‘‘at risk’’,
beginning at their analysis start date (the latest of the
following three dates: first Mayo Clinic visit, diagnosis of
IBD, or diagnosis of PSC). Controls were considered ‘‘at risk’’
beginning at the later of first Mayo Clinic visit or diagnosis of
UC. This date is subsequently referred to as the ‘‘observa￾tional start date.’’
The primary analysis examined survival free of an event for
these four outcomes: (1) colorectal cancer alone; (2) colo￾rectal cancer or dysplasia; (3) subsequent proctocolectomy;
and (4) patient death. Each analysis accounted for the
matching of PSC-IBD cases to CUC controls using survival
models for a matched case control design (SAS procedure
PHREG28 with case control matched sets as strata). For three
end points (colorectal cancer alone, colorectal cancer or
dysplasia, and subsequent proctocolectomy), the additional
relevant covariates of patient age, duration of IBD, and date
of IBD diagnosis were included in the models. (Although the
latter two factors were used to match a case to two controls,
they were not exactly matched.) For overall survival, as there
were only 15 events, a model including both age and case
control status failed to converge. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95%
confidence intervals (CI) were computed from the estimated
coefficients in the PHREG models. In this analysis of overall
survival, follow up was censored at the time of the last follow
up or at OLT. (Censoring overall survival data at the time of
liver transplantation is appropriate as this procedure sig￾nificantly alters the ‘‘natural history’’ of chronic liver diseases
such as PSC.)
Secondary analyses of event free survival ignored the
matching between cases and controls and also used Cox
PHREG models29 (SAS procedure PHREG28). However, to
assess whether a diagnosis of PSC was significantly
associated with each outcome, these analyses also included
the potential effect modifiers of age at observational start
date, calendar year of start date, duration of IBD at start date,
and the presence of rectal sparing as additional covariates
(predictor variables) in each event type model. The cumula￾tive probability of colorectal neoplasia, subsequent proctoco￾lectomy, and overall survival, separately for cases and
controls, were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier product
limit method,30 and a univariate comparison of these groups
was examined using the two sample log rank test. In the
unmatched analysis of overall survival, follow up was
censored at the time of the last follow up or at OLT.
RESULTS
Demographics and extent of colitis
In total, 71 patients with concurrent PSC and IBD were
identified, and these were matched with 142 UC patients
without liver involvement. Of 71 cases, 61 (86%) had CUC,
five were diagnosed with CD (7%), and five patients had IC
(7%). Table 1 displays the features of the three IBD
subgroups. As noted in the footnote to table 1, only two of
five patients carrying a diagnosis of CD had clearcut evidence
of this (colonic stricture and perianastomotic ulcers in one,
and perianal fistula and ileal stricture in the other). The other
three ‘‘CD’’ patients had in fact indeterminate features, and

pancolitis was noted in two. Two, possibly three, of the five
‘‘IC’’ patients had features leaning strongly towards CUC. In
all three groups of PSC-IBD patients, the prevalence of rectal
sparing and backwash ileitis was high.
Table 2 illustrates the matched characteristics of cases and
controls. Both groups were matched equally for sex, with a
resulting 65% male predominance. Median age at IBD
diagnosis was slightly older in the PSC-IBD group (32 years
(range 9–73) v 31 years (range 6–80) in the control IBD
group). Cases and controls were reasonably well matched
with respect to calendar year of diagnosis of IBD (mean (SD)
case-control difference, 1.5 (3.3) years) and duration of IBD
at the observational start date (mean (SD) case-control
difference, 0.8 (2.9) years). Median age at PSC diagnosis in
the cases was 42 years (range 10–71). In the cases, median
number of years from IBD diagnosis to PSC diagnosis was
8.2 years (range 10.9 years (PSC first) to 32.3 years). The
prevalence of pancolitis was 87% in the PSC group and 54%
in the control CUC group (p,0.001). Rectal sparing was
noted in 52% in the PSC-IBD group versus 6% of the CUC
control group (p,0.001). Importantly, no patient with rectal
sparing was being treated with topical enema preparations
which might have explained this distribution of colitis.
Likewise, ‘‘backwash ileitis’’ was noted significantly more
frequently in the PSC-IBD group (51% of the 45 in whom the
ileum was viewed v 7% in the control group) (p,0.01).
Follow up (ignoring matching between cases and
controls)
Subsequent colorectal neoplasia was observed more often in
the PSC group (table 2). Seven cases (10%) and four controls
(3%) developed colorectal cancer, three cases (4%) and four
controls (3%) developed high grade dysplasia, and eight cases
(11%) and seven controls (5%) developed low grade
dysplasia. In the cases, two cancers were right sided (39%)
versus two cancers in controls (50%). In PSC-IBD cases
developing cancer or dysplasia, the median interval from
diagnosis of IBD to development of dysplasia or cancer was
12.7 years (range 0.3–41). Median interval from first Mayo
visit to dysplasia or cancer was three years in PSC-IBD cases
(range 8 days–8.5 years). Median time interval from PSC
diagnosis to development of dysplasia or cancer was 4.9 years
(range 11 days–20 years).
In those cases who did not develop dysplasia or cancer, the
median interval between the observational start date (latest
of first Mayo visit, IBD diagnosis, or PSC diagnosis) and last
follow up or surgical treatment (whichever came first) was
2.0 years (range 1 day–11.4 years). In contrast, the median
interval in controls was 0.2 years (range 1 day–15.5 years) in
CUC controls. Considering the time period prior to the first
Mayo visit, the median interval from IBD diagnosis to last
follow up or surgery was 14.0 years (range 26 days–
39.7 years) in cases and 10.9 years (1 day to 45.4 years) in
controls.
IPAA was performed in 14 PSC-IBD patients (13%) and 43
controls (30%). Pouchitis occurred at least once in 10 PSC￾IBD patients (71% of those with IPAA) and 13 controls
(30%). Brooke ileostomy was undertaken in five cases (7%)
and 21 controls (15%) while seven PSC-IBD patients (4%)
underwent subtotal colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis
(compared with none of the control patients). Three of five
PSC patients who underwent Brooke ileostomy formation
developed parastomal varices (60%) versus none of the 21
controls who underwent this procedure.
A total of 17 deaths occurred (12 cases, five controls).
There were four deaths in the PSC-IBD group from IBD

related causes (all from metastatic carcinoma) and five
deaths from PSC related causes (decompensated liver failure,
cholangiocarcinoma, and hepatorenal syndrome). There were
three unrelated deaths in the PSC-IBD group, and all five
deaths in the control group were unrelated to IBD.
Overall, 23 PSC-IBD cases (32%) underwent OLT for
treatment of PSC. Of these, six (26%) developed colorectal
neoplasia compared with 12 non-OLT patients (25%) who
developed colorectal dysplasia or cancer. Bile duct cancer or
gall bladder cancer occurred in five patients (7%). Two of
these patients (40%) also developed colorectal neoplasia
versus a colorectal neoplasia frequency of 22% in those cases
without hepatobiliary cancer.
Primary analysis retaining matching between cases
and controls
Adjusting for patient age, duration of IBD, and date of IBD
diagnosis, a diagnosis of PSC was suggested as a risk factor
for colorectal dysplasia or cancer but this was not statistically
significant (HR 1.7 (95% CI 0.6–4.9); p = 0.29). The associa￾tion between PSC and development of cancer alone was also
not significant (HR 1.9 (95% CI 0.3–11.9; p = 0.53). A PSC
diagnosis was significantly associated with a lower risk for
subsequent proctocolectomy (HR 0.3 (95% CI 0.1–0.7);
p = 0.004). In the univariate analysis, both patient age and
a PSC diagnosis were significantly associated with reduced
patient survival. However, the limited number of events (only
15 deaths) among the 213 patients precluded including both
as variables in the model. Results for overall survival are only
given for the unmatched analysis below.
Secondary analysis ignoring matching between cases
and controls
The cumulative probability of colorectal dysplasia or cancer
from the observational start date was borderline significantly
higher in PSC patients (p = 0.054, log rank) (fig 1). Five years
after the index date, the cumulative probability of dysplasia
or cancer was 33% at five years (95% CI 17–46%) for cases
compared with 13% at five years (95% CI 4–21%) for controls.
However, the cumulative probability of cancer alone was not
significantly different between the two groups (14% at five
years for cases (95% CI 3–25%) v 4% at five years for controls
(95% CI 0–10%); p = 0.13, log rank).
The PHREG model, incorporating age at the observational
start date, calendar year of start date, duration of IBD at start
date, and presence of rectal sparing as potential confounders,
indicated that PSC was a borderline significant independent
risk factor for the development of dysplasia or cancer (HR 2.1
(95% CI 0.9–4.7); p = 0.07). Analysis of survival free of cancer
alone showed a significantly elevated risk ratio for PSC (HR
4.5 (95% CI 1.1–18.4); p = 0.03).
The cumulative probability of proctocolectomy was lower
for the PSC group (26% by five years (95% CI 13–38%)
compared with 56% by five years in the UC group (95% CI 45–
65%); p,0.0001, log rank). However, the PHREG model,
adjusting for important covariates, indicated that PSC was a
borderline significant protective factor (HR 0.5 (95% CI 0.3–
1.0); p = 0.054).
Overall survival was significantly worse in the PSC-IBD
group compared with CUC controls (p,0.001, log-rank)
(fig 2). Overall survival among cases five years from the
observational start date was 79% (95% CI 65–94%) compared
with 97% at five years in controls (95% CI 93–100%). (If
follow up was not censored at the time of liver transplanta￾tion, the results were not appreciably different—five year
survival of 81% among cases versus 97% among controls.)
The PHREG model adjusting for age at observational start
date, calendar year, duration of IBD, and presence of rectal
sparing indicated that this association was statistically
significant (HR 9.7 (95% CI 2.3–41); p,0.01).
DISCUSSION
In this referral centre based study, inflammatory bowel
disease associated with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC￾IBD) was characterised by a high prevalence of pancolitis
with rectal sparing and backwash ileitis. The study findings
were suggestive (but not definite) that PSC-IBD patients
were at higher risk for colorectal neoplasia. The primary
analysis, based on the matched case control design, failed to
indicate a significant increased risk. However, the secondary
unmatched analysis adjusting for age, calendar year, and
duration of IBD suggested that the presence of PSC was a
significant independent risk factor for the development of
cancer alone and was suggestive for the development of
colorectal neoplasia (cancer or dysplasia). Although PSC-IBD
patients were less likely than those of the comparison CUC
group to undergo colectomy, the frequency of certain
postoperative complications, such as pouchitis or parastomal
varices, was higher in these patients. Finally, PSC-IBD
patients were also observed to have a reduced survival
compared with controls. Again, the matched analysis failed
to confirm this while the unmatched analysis indicated that
the presence of PSC was a significant independent risk factor
for death adjusting for several potential confounders. All of
the above distinguishing characteristics suggest that PSC-IBD
may be a distinct IBD phenotype.
Most large case series of PSC patients have focused on the
hepatobiliary manifestations of the condition, and there are
surprisingly few details about the extent of PSC-IBD.1 2 31–33
Most PSC-IBD patients have extensive colitis, with or
without ileal involvement. The prevalence of isolated ileal
involvement is quite low. The high prevalence of rectal
sparing in PSC-IBD has been reported in preliminary
fashion.7 In many series, this subtype of IBD is thought to
represent ‘‘IC’’ on the basis of either ileal involvement or
rectal sparing. The prevalence of CD reported in the same
series ranges from 0% to 17%, with an average of 8%.1 2 31–33
Where specified, most of these patients with ‘‘CD’’ have
colonic involvement. Most of these patients do not appear to
have features that are strongly suggestive of CD, such as
fistulas, deep ulcers, or granulomas. It is not clear if the
variance in prevalence of IBD subtypes is related to a true
difference in prevalence or a misclassification of subtype. At
our institution, PSC patients with rectal sparing or mild ileitis

colitis or IC, but rather CUC with rectal sparing, or ‘‘PSC￾IBD.’’
Our study findings do not resolve the issue of whether PSC
could be an independent risk factor for colorectal neoplasia in
IBD. In an earlier cohort study from our institution, the
number of colorectal cancers in a cohort of PSC patients
(which did not overlap with the cohort in the present study)
was compared with that expected based on rates of colorectal
cancer in a Swedish population based cohort.17 The use of
population based controls from another country for referral
based cases may not have been appropriate. In addition, the
cumulative colectomy rate was quite high (38%) and this
may have masked the propensity for development of
neoplasia.17 In the present study, we utilised a comparison
CUC group selected from the same referral population as the
PSC-IBD cases. In a previous case control study from our
institution, the prevalence of PSC among CUC cases with
colorectal cancer was compared with that among CUC
controls without colorectal cancer.21 The adjusted odds ratio
for colorectal carcinoma with PSC was 1.23 (95% CI 0.62–
2.42). However, the fact that our institution serves as a major
referral centre for PSC may have artificially inflated the
prevalence of PSC among CUC controls.
The mechanism by which PSC could be associated with an
increased risk of colorectal neoplasia in IBD remains unclear.
Increased duration and extent of colitis are well recognised
risk factors for dysplasia and cancer, and there is a high
prevalence of pancolitis in PSC-IBD. After adjusting for
duration of IBD, the association of PSC with the development
of dysplasia and cancer was only of borderline statistical
significance. Disease activity of IBD in PSC patients is often
mild and occasionally completely asymptomatic.7 34 35 Indeed,
in one study, PSC patients without bowel symptoms were
found to have not only pancolitis but also indefinite or low
grade dysplasia, suggesting that the pancolitis was long￾standing.34 Therefore, it is possible that PSC serves as a
surrogate marker for longstanding but asymptomatic CUC.
Other possible mechanisms for the association may include
alterations in the bile salt pool or folate deficiency. The
intriguing finding of lower rates of colorectal neoplasia
among PSC patients treated with ursodeoxycholic acid
suggests that bile acids indeed may play a role in the
pathogenesis,36 37 and this warrants further study. What is
not in doubt is the 10-fold increased risk of colorectal cancer
in PSC patients relative to the general population.38 For the
clinician, it seems prudent to recognise that PSC-IBD patients
clearly have a substantial risk of colorectal dysplasia or
cancer, regardless of the mechanism of action, and such
patients should be enrolled in a colonoscopic surveillance
programme immediately on diagnosis of PSC.
The difference in the rates of colectomy between cases and
controls suggests a milder course of colitis in PSC-IBD
patients compared with UC patients, which has been noted
previously,7 34 35 but it is conceivable that referral bias
influenced the results. Pouchitis following IPAA appeared
to be more common in PSC-IBD cases, confirming previous
observations.8 9 The mechanism for the association between
PSC and pouchitis remains unclear. The high rate of
parastomal varices in those cases that underwent Brooke
ileostomy formation is more easily explained on the basis of
portal hypertension. Surgical revision of the stoma alone is
usually unsuccessful, and these patients usually require a
procedure to address the underlying portal hypertension,
such as TIPS, surgical shunting, or liver transplantation.8
The increased mortality in the PSC group can be explained
mostly by IBD and PSC related causes (colorectal cancer,
hepatic failure, and cholangiocarcinoma). Cholangiocar￾cinoma remains an important cause of morbidity and
mortality in PSC; bile duct cancer developed in 7%, similar
to other studies.4 5
Several weaknesses of our study deserve comment. Firstly,
our study relied on review of the medical records of patients
retrospectively identified from diagnostic indices. Therefore,
endoscopic surveillance for neoplasia was not performed on a
protocol basis and was variable in frequency. Secondly,
because PSC is a disease with an insidious onset and a
presumable lengthy asymptomatic phase, the date of
diagnosis of PSC is to some extent driven by the awareness
and diagnostic aggressiveness of individual physicians.
Therefore, patients in whom colorectal cancer was diagnosed
several years before or simultaneously with a diagnosis of
PSC may actually have had asymptomatic PSC for years.
Thirdly, because the subclinical phase of PSC-IBD may be
longer than previously appreciated, the duration of colitis in
the PSC population may have been similarly underestimated.
Fourthly, the high prevalence of pancolitis, short median
interval from diagnosis of IBD to development of neoplasia,
and the high cumulative incidence of colectomy in CUC
controls suggests that our referral centre based controls may
not be representative of CUC in the general population.
Finally, the high colectomy rate and shorter follow up after
the first Mayo visit in CUC controls may explain in part the
differences in results in the matched and unmatched
analyses—in the primary analysis, follow up of all members
of a case-control pair or trio was censored at the earliest loss
of follow up of any member.
Given the high frequency of asymptomatic colitis, rectal
sparing, and colorectal neoplasia among PSC-IBD patients,
flexible sigmoidoscopy or barium enema would appear to be
insufficient means of evaluating the colon. All patients with
PSC, even those who are asymptomatic, should undergo full
colonoscopy with biopsies to detect subclinical IBD and/or
neoplasia. Given the high cumulative incidence of colorectal
neoplasia, and short mean interval between PSC diagnosis
and development of neoplasia, PSC-IBD patients should
consider immediate entry into a surveillance colonoscopy
programme. By targeting the subset of patients with CUC at
highest risk for dysplasia, surveillance with biopsies may
provide the highest yield of patients who have potentially
curable disease. Data from this study would suggest that
patients with PSC-IBD represent such a subset of patients
and require thorough colonoscopic surveillance with exten￾sive biopsy sampling.

EDITOR’S QUIZ: GI SNAPSHOT ..................................................................
Answer
From question on page 77
The diagnosis is strongyloidiasis hyperinfection. Duodenal biopsy (fig 1A, B) shows crypt
hyperplasia and villous atrophy. Numerous rhabditiform larvae are seen within the crypts.
There is mild to moderate infiltrate of polymorphs in the lamina propia.
Strongyloidiasis stercoralis is a cosmopolitan nematode commonly known as human
threadworm. Chronic infection is often asymptomatic and may persist for years or even
decades due to the ability of the worm for autoinfection. In an immunocompromised host,
the organism multiplies, leading to overwhelming parasitic load (hyperinfection). The
treatment of choice in the hyperinfection state is thiabendazole 25 mg/kg twice a day for
7–10 days.1
Strongyloidiasis stercoralis should be considered if at risk patients are commenced on
immunosuppressive treatment and fail to improve or deteriorate. The role of duodenal
biopsy in the diagnosis of this disease is not well established but it proved to be of great
value in our case.
