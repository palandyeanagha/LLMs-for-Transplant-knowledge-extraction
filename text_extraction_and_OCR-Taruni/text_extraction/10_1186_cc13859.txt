Abstract
Introduction: The study was designed to assess the impact of fluid loading on lung aeration, oxygenation and
hemodynamics in patients with septic shock and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
Methods: During a 1-year period, a prospective observational study was performed in 32 patients with septic shock
and ARDS. Cardiorespiratory parameters were measured using Swan Ganz (n = 29) or PiCCO catheters (n = 3). Lung
aeration and regional pulmonary blood flows were measured using bedside transthoracic ultrasound. Measurements
were performed before (T0), at the end of volume expansion (T1) and 40 minutes later (T2), consisting of 1-L of saline
over 30 minutes during the first 48 h following onset of septic shock and ARDS.
Results: Lung ultrasound score increased by 23% at T2, from 13 at baseline to 16 (P < 0.001). Cardiac index and cardiac
filling pressures increased significantly at T1 (P < 0.001) and returned to control values at T2. The increase in lung
ultrasound score was statistically correlated with fluid loading-induced increase in cardiac index and was not associated
with increase in pulmonary shunt or regional pulmonary blood flow. At T1, PaO2/FiO2 significantly increased (P < 0.005)
from 144 (123 to 198) to 165 (128 to 226) and returned to control values at T2, whereas lung ultrasound score
continued to increase.
Conclusions: Early fluid loading transitorily improves hemodynamics and oxygenation and worsens lung aeration.
Aeration changes can be detected at the bedside by transthoracic lung ultrasound, which may serve as a safeguard
against excessive fluid loading.
Introduction
Optimization of cardiac preload by fluid loading is a key
issue in the treatment of septic shock. However, fluid
administration may contribute to pulmonary edema in
critically ill patients with acute respiratory distress syn￾drome (ARDS) whose alveolar-capillary permeability is
increased. A positive hemodynamic response to fluid
defined by a 10 to 15% increase in cardiac index (CI)
[1,2], could be associated with arterial oxygenation de￾terioration and loss of lung aeration.
Two mechanisms may deteriorate gas exchange: in￾crease in pulmonary shunt resulting from the increase in
cardiac output (CO) and decrease in ventilation perfu￾sion ratio induced by pulmonary edema resulting from an
increase in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP)
[3,4]. On the other hand, because hypoxic pulmonary va￾soconstriction is markedly impaired by lung and systemic
inflammation [3], increase in venous mixed oxygen satur￾ation (SvO2) may improve arterial oxygenation if pulmo￾nary blood flow does not increase in non aerated lung

regions. Therefore, the effects of fluid loading on arterial
oxygenation are difficult to predict.
PCWP, SvO2, CO and intrapulmonary shunt (QVa/Qt)
can be assessed at the bedside invasively, using a fiber
optic Swan-Ganz catheter. Interstitial-alveolar edema,
lung aeration and their variations can be assessed non￾invasively using bedside transthoracic lung ultrasound
[5-7]. Changes in pulmonary blood flow supplying non
aerated lung regions can be evaluated using bedside
Doppler lung ultrasound [8-11].
There are clear recommendations for fluid loading at
the initial phase of septic shock [12] and a general agree￾ment for restricting fluid intake at the early phase of
ARDS. A retrospective study has suggested that adequate
initial fluid resuscitation during the first 2 days followed
by conservative late fluid management is essential for im￾proving final outcome of patients with septic shock and
ARDS [13]. No study however, has assessed the immediate
effects of fluid administration on gas exchange and lung
aeration. The primary objective of this study performed in
patients with septic shock and ARDS was to evaluate the
effects of fluid loading on lung aeration assessed by lung
ultrasound. Secondary objectives were to assess concomi￾tant changes in arterial oxygenation and hemodynamics.
Material and methods
Patients
This prospective observational study was performed in
the multidisciplinary ICU of La Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital.
The protocol was approved by the local Ethical Commit￾tee (Comité de Protection des Personnes, Ile de France
VI, Groupe Hospitalier Pitié-Salpêtrière, Paris, France,
session nº18/2011) who considered the study an integral
part of care provided to patients with ARDS and septic
shock and waived the need for patients to give written
informed consent. In our ICU, such patients are rou￾tinely monitored using a PiCCO or a fiber optic Swan￾Ganz catheter [14-16] and transthoracic lung ultrasound
is a common procedure to assess changes in lung aera￾tion [6,7,17]. Thirty-two mechanically ventilated patients
were included within 48 h following onset of septic shock
and ARDS, defined according to referent recommenda￾tions [18,19]. Patients’ relatives were orally informed of
the study, including the results.
Exclusion criteria were age under 18 years, past history
of chronic lung disease, active bleeding, ARDS and sep￾tic shock lasting more than 48 h, body positioning in the
prone position, left ventricular ejection fraction lower
than 50%, PCWP ≥18 mmHg, cardiogenic shock as the
possible etiology, and pregnancy.
Protocol
In each patient, fluid loading was directed by the attend￾ing physician following the criteria recommended by the
Survival Sepsis Campaign: [12] within 6 h following on￾set of septic shock, 20 mL.kg−1 of saline were rapidly ad￾ministered before norepinephrine administration; during
the next 48 h, fluid loading was continued to obtain a
central venous pressure (CVP) ≥12 mmHg and reduce
the level of vasopressor support. At the time of inclu￾sion, none of the patients had CVP ≥12 mmHg, thereby
justifying the fluid loading they received. Patients were
included between the 24th and the 48th hour. Twenty￾nine patients included were previously monitored with
an arterial catheter and a fiber optic pulmonary arterial
catheter (Swan-Ganz Standard Thermodilution Pulmo￾nary Artery Catheter, Edwards Lifescience, Irvine, CA,
USA) and three with the PiCCO system (PULSION med￾ical systems AG, Munich, Germany).
Respiratory, hemodynamic, echocardiographic and lung
ultrasound measurements were performed at baseline be￾fore loading (T0). Then 1,000 mL of saline were infused
over 30 minutes and, respiratory, hemodynamic and lung
ultrasound parameters were measured at the end of vol￾ume expansion (T1) and 40 minutes later (T2). Arterial
and mixed venous blood gas, red blood cell count, he￾matocrit and blood lactate were also measured at T0, T1
and T2.
All patients were sedated using midazolam 0.15 mg.

using atracurium 50 mg.h−1 whenever it was needed
[20]. Patients were ventilated using a volume-control
mode with a constant inspiratory flow and a tidal volume
of 5 to 6 mL.kg−1
, the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2)
was maintained at 0.6 or above if the arterial oxygen
saturation (SaO2) remained <95%, the respiratory rate was
optimized according to previous studies and recommen￾dations [21] and the inspiratory/expiratory ratio was fixed
at 0.5 (0.33 to 0.50). Positive end-expiratory pressure
(PEEP) was set according to lung morphology as pre￾viously described [22,23]. Plateau pressure, PEEP and auto
PEEP were recorded throughout the study. Ventilation
settings were kept constant throughout the study.
Measurements
Arterial pressure was continuously measured and re￾corded from the arterial line. In patients equipped with a
fiber optic Swan-Ganz catheter pulmonary arterial pres￾sure and right atrial pressure were continuously re￾corded on MetaVision Clinical Information Management
System for ICUs (ICU electronic medical records sys￾tem, iMDsoft, Tel-Aviv, Israel) and PCWP and CVP was
intermittently measured at end-expiration. CO was mea￾sured with simultaneous withdrawing of systemic and
pulmonary arterial blood samples within 1 minute. Ar￾terial oxygen tension (PaO2), arterial carbon dioxide ten￾sion (PaCO2) and pH, hemoglobin and methemoglobin
concentrations and arterial and mixed venous oxygen

saturations were measured using an ABL 825 hemoxi￾meter (Radiometer Copenhagen, Denmark). Standard
formulas were used to calculate the CI, the systemic vas￾cular resistance index (SVRI), pulmonary vascular resist￾ance index (PVRI), the QVa/Qt, oxygen delivery (DO2),
and oxygen consumption (VO2). In patients equipped
with a PiCCO catheter, QVa/Qt and left ventricular car￾diac filling pressures could not be measured.
In patients lying in the supine position or in the semi￾recumbent position who were hemodynamically stable,
echocardiographic measurements were performed off￾line, by an experienced observer with level-3 certifica￾tion, who was unaware of the clinical data and other
hemodynamic measurements. All measurements were
made at end-expiration over five consecutive cardiac
cycles. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed
using a Siemens Acuson CV70 (Siemens Healthcare,
Erlangen, Germany) and images were stored digitally for
later playback and analysis. Left ventricular ejection
fraction was assessed using the Simpson modified bi￾plane method. Transmitral flow was recorded by pulsed
Doppler with the sample volume placed at the mitral
valve tips. Mitral inflow velocity was analyzed for peak
velocity of early (E) and late (A) filling and deceleration
time (DT) of E was measured. In the presence of
arrhythmia, the peak velocity of early mitral inflow (E)
was measured over five cardiac cycles [24]. Velocities of
mitral annulus were recorded by a tissue Doppler im￾aging program with a 5-mm sample volume placed at
the lateral corner of the mitral annulus. The early dia￾stolic (E/e’) velocity of mitral annular displacement was
measured from the tissue Doppler imaging recording.

Right (R, gray bars) and left (L, gray bars) lungs at baseline and 40 minutes after fluid loading (red bars). As shown in (B) and (C), in each patient,
six regions of interest were examined on each side, delineated by parasternal line (PSL), anterior axillary line (AAL), posterior axillary line (PAL) and
paravertebral line (PVL): 1 = anterior and superior lung region; 2 = anterior and inferior lung region; 3 = lateral and superior lung; 4 = lateral and
inferior lung region; 5 = posterior and superior lung region (the acoustic window is located in intercostal spaces between the scapula and
vertebrae); 6 = posterior and inferior lung region. Each region of interest is characterized by the worst ultrasound pattern detected allowing the
calculation of a regional ultrasound score: Normal = 0, interstitial edema (spaced B1 lines) = 1, interstitial-alveolar edema (coalescent B2 lines) = 2,
lung consolidation = 3. The lung ultrasound score (LUS) is calculated as the sum of each individual score, ranging between 0 and 36 [27]. On the
Y axis, the mean score per region of interest is indicated ± SD.

Transthoracic lung ultrasound was performed offline
by an experienced investigator with level-3 certification
[25], who was unaware of any other hemodynamic mea￾sures. A Siemens Acuson CV70 and a 2- to 4-MHz
round-tipped or convex probe were used. As shown in
Figure 1B and 1C, 12 regions of interest were examined
and the quantification of aeration was calculated applying
a lung ultrasound score (LUS) as previously described
[26,27]. For a given region of interest, all intercostal spaces
were carefully and extensively examined. Four ultrasound
patterns corresponding to different degrees of aeration
loss were looked for in each intercostal space: 0) normal
aeration, characterized by the presence of lung sliding
with horizontal A lines and, occasionally, one or two iso￾lated vertical B lines; 1) moderate loss of lung aeration:
either multiple well-defined and spaced B1 lines, issued

and superior lung region with the presence of lung sliding and A lines; (B) the image obtained 40 minutes after fluid loading, shows the
presence of B1 lines in the same lung region. In the second patient, (C) the image obtained before fluid loading shows normal aeration in the
left lateral and inferior lung region with the presence of lung sliding and A lines; (D) the image obtained 40 minutes after fluid loading, shows
the presence of B2 lines in the same lung region. In the third patient, (E) the image obtained before fluid loading shows B1 lines in the right
lateral and inferior lung region; (F) the image obtained 40 minutes after fluid loading, shows the presence of B2 lines issued from a juxtapleural
consolidation in the same lung region.

from the pleural line or from small juxtapleural consolida￾tions and corresponding to interstitial edema; or coales￾cent B2 lines, issued from the pleural line or from small
juxtapleural consolidations, present in a limited portion of
the intercostal space and corresponding to localized alveo￾lar edema; 2) severe loss of lung aeration, characterized by
multiple coalescent vertical B2 lines issued either from the
pleural line (Figure 2D) or from juxtapleural consoli￾dations (Figure 2F), detected in the whole area of one or
several intercostal spaces and corresponding to diffuse al￾veolar edema; 3) complete loss of lung aeration resulting
in lung consolidation and characterized by the presence of
tissue pattern containing either hyperechoïc punctiform
images representative of static air bronchograms, or hy￾perechoïc tubular images, representative of dynamic air
bronchograms. The worst ultrasound pattern observed in
one or several intercostal spaces was considered as charac￾terizing the region of interest. A value (0, 1, 2 or 3) was
attributed to each region examined and the LUS was cal￾culated as the sum of the 12 regions examined. More de￾tailed information on transthoracic lung ultrasound can
be obtained online [28] by clicking on Basic skills in trans￾thoracic lung ultrasound to download the corresponding
PowerPoint presentation. Using Doppler with color-flow
mapping, regional pulmonary blood flow present within
consolidated lung areas was assessed as previously de￾scribed [29]. Pulmonary arterial and venous blood flow
signals were obtained by positioning the sample volume
into the center of the lumen of the detected vessel and
placing the ultrasound beam as parallel as possible to the
flow. The spectral waveforms were considered good if 1)
pulmonary artery blood flow could be differentiated from
pulmonary vein blood flow; 2) the resolution was ad￾equate for serial measurements. As previously described
[9] arterial waveform consists principally of a rapid systolic
acceleration phase, followed by rapid deceleration. Peak

velocity, mean velocity and velocity time-interval were
measured before and after fluid loading in the pulmonary
artery supplying a consolidated lung region and character￾ized by a biphasic flow (Figure 3).
Statistical analysis
The primary endpoint of the study was the increase in
LUS after fluid loading. In a previous study, patients
with ARDS had a mean LUS of 15 ± 4.8 [7]. Expecting a
30% increase in LUS resulting from fluid loading, we cal￾culated that 31 patients would be needed based on 90%
statistical power and an actual alpha value of 0.05. The
secondary endpoints were changes in regional pulmon￾ary blood flow, heart rate, mean arterial pressure, mean
pulmonary arterial pressure, PCWP, right atrial pressure,
CI, SvO2, systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance in￾dices, arteriovenous oxygen difference, oxygen delivery,
oxygen consumption, lactate, hemoglobin, PaO2/FiO2
and QVa/Qt. Data are expressed as mean ± SD or me￾dian and interquartile range (25 to 75%) according to
the data distribution. Cardiorespiratory variables, LUS,
peak velocity, mean velocity and velocity time-intervals
measured at T0, T1 and T2 were compared using one￾way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for repeated mea￾sures or Friedman repeated measures ANOVA on ranks
followed by post hoc Tukey test, using software Sigma￾stat 3.1 e Sigmaplot 11.0 (Systat Software Inc., Point
Richmond, CA, USA). The statistical significance level
was fixed at 0.05.
Results
Clinical and cardiopulmonary characteristics of the pa￾tients are summarized in Table 1. According to the
Berlin definition [19] 8 patients had mild ARDS, 21
moderate ARDS and 3 severe ARDS. Causes of ARDS
were community-acquired pneumonia (n = 1), ventilator￾associated pneumonia (n = 22), aspiration pneumonia (n =
1), pulmonary contusion (n = 2) and extrapulmonary
ARDS (n = 6). Causes of septic shock were pneumonia
(n = 26), peritonitis (n = 5) and necrotizing fasciitis (n = 1).
As previously reported in patients with ARDS using
computerized tomography [30,31], loss of lung aeration
was predominantly found in dependent posterior lung re￾gions and similarly distributed on both sides (Figure 1A).
Fluid loading-induced aeration loss observed between T0
and T2 was mainly due to the onset of coalescent B lines
in initially normally aerated lung regions or regions with
interstitial edema characterized by B1 lines (Figure 1A).
As shown in Figure 4, LUS significantly increased by 8%
between T0 and T1 (P = 0.01), and by 23% between T0
and T2 (P <0.001). New consolidations appeared only in
13% of lung regions concerned by aeration loss. Illustrative
images of these changes are shown in Figure 2.
Table 2 summarizes hemodynamic changes observed
between T0 and T2. CI, aortic velocity time-integral, mean
arterial pressure, mean pulmonary artery pressure, PCWP,
CVP, DO2 and VO2 increased significantly at T1 and
returned to control values at T2 suggesting a redistribu￾tion of the fluid out of the vascular compartment. Con￾comitantly, systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance
indices, arteriovenous oxygen difference, hemoglobin and
lactates significantly decreased at T1 and returned to con￾trol values at T2.
As shown in Figure 5, the PaO2/FiO2 ratio significantly
increased at T1 and returned to control values at T2,

whereas QVa/Qt remained unchanged (Table 2). Con￾comitantly, CI significantly increased at T1 and returned
to control values at T2 (Figure 6A), whereas right and
left velocity time intervals measured in the pulmonary
arteries supplying non aerated lung regions, remained
unchanged (Figure 6B). There was significant but weak
correlation between the increase in LUS at T1 and the
increase in CI at T1 (R = 0.4, P = 0.04).
The results were not influenced by the hemodynamic
response to fluid loading. The increase in PaO2/FiO2
and LUS were not different between 13 patients whose
CI increased by less than 10% and 19 patients whose CI
increased by more than 10%.
Discussion
The present study performed in patients with septic
shock and ARDS shows that the hemodynamic benefit
of fluid loading is associated with worsened lung aer￾ation that does not match a decline in oxygenation. Fol￾lowing goal-directed fluid loading, CI and cardiac filling
pressures immediately increased and rapidly returned to
control values. It induced an immediate, slight but sig￾nificant loss of lung aeration that worsened over time,
whereas pulmonary shunt as well as regional pulmonary
blood flow did not change. Arterial oxygenation in￾creased at the end of fluid loading and returned to con￾trol values 40 minutes later.
Fluid loading-induced loss of lung aeration was de￾tected by transthoracic ultrasound as an increase in
LUS. In 87% of lung regions demonstrating ultrasound
changes following fluid loading, new B lines appeared
immediately or 40 minutes after volume expansion. B
lines are vertical artifacts resulting from the abnormal
interface existing between alveolar gas and excess of
lung water (or tissue) and can be used for tracking aer￾ation change [32]. Rapid appearance of multiple B lines
(B1 lines) following fluid loading is strongly evocative of
interstitial edema, whereas appearance of coalescent B
lines (B2 lines) is suggestive of interstitial-alveolar ede￾ma. In the present study these changes were observed in
less than 20% of examined lung areas, suggesting that
fluid loading-induced interstitial-alveolar edema had a
regional and heterogeneous distribution. Interestingly,
the occurrence of regional lung edema was not associ￾ated with an increase in pulmonary shunt. As shown in
Figure 6, despite the increase in CI, regional pulmonary
blood flows within consolidated lung regions did not
change, suggesting a predominant distribution in pul￾monary vessels supplying normally aerated lung regions.
As a matter of fact, between 40 and 50% of lung regions
were normally aerated before fluid loading, leaving the
possibility of a predominant distribution of the increase
in CI in these regions.
Immediately after fluid loading, CI and arterial oxyge￾nation significantly increased without change in pulmon￾ary shunt. In fact, fluid loading-induced improvement in
arterial oxygenation was related to a reduction in ar￾teriovenous oxygen difference [33], whereas the most
likely mechanism explaining fluid loading-induced de￾terioration of lung aeration was the slight but significant
increase in PCWP in patients with injury of the alveolar
capillary membrane. Many studies have demonstrated
that even modest changes in PCWP can limit or pro￾mote the formation of interstitial-alveolar edema in ex￾perimental ARDS [32].
What are the clinical implications of our findings?
When septic shock is associated with ARDS, the opti￾mum fluid strategy remains uncertain and controversial:
early vascular filling is critical for supporting hemody￾namics and improving outcome in septic patients [12],
whereas fluid loading may be deleterious for lung func￾tion [34-37]. A study performed in patients with acute
lung injury secondary to septic shock, has proposed a bi￾phasic fluid strategy [13]: fluid loading based on hemo￾dynamic and oxygenation targets during the first 48 h
and fluid restriction during the following days. The pre￾sent study shows, however, that early fluid loading only

transitorily improves hemodynamics and oxygenation,
whereas it induces a progressive decrease in lung aer￾ation detected by transthoracic LUS. This unexpected
result confirms experimental data showing that LUS is
much more sensitive than oxygenation changes to detect
loss of lung aeration [38]. Therefore, by detection of aer￾ation loss at the bedside, lung ultrasound could be a sen￾sitive tool to assess the risk/benefit ratio of fluid loading
in patients with septic shock and ARDS. Late conse￾quences of fluid loading-induced worsening of lung aer￾ation were not assessed in the present study. Three
studies, however, have reported increased mortality as￾sociated with positive fluid balance at the early phase
of ARDS. In the ARDSnet tidal volume study cohort,
higher mortality was observed in patients with a positive
fluid balance observed at day 1 and persisting at day 4
[36]. Higher mortality was also observed in patients with
an increase in extravascular lung water indexed to pre￾dicted body weight at day 1 [39,40].
Several methodological limitations are to be discussed.
First, the enrolled population was characterized by mild
to moderate ARDS associated with septic shock caused
mainly by ventilator-associated pneumonia observed pre￾dominantly in surgical patients. Extrapulmonary ARDS
was present in less than 20% of patients. As previously
demonstrated, ventilator-associated pneumonia is made
of disseminated foci of pneumonia associated to large con￾solidations predominating in the lower lobes [6,41,42].
Therefore, the results of the present study may not
apply to other causes of medical ARDS where high
permeability-type alveolar edema is predominant or to
more severe and extended forms of the disease. Sec￾ond, measurements were time-limited and the late conse￾quences of fluid loading-induced decrease in lung aeration
were not assessed. The fact that lung aeration continued
to decrease 40 minutes after the end of fluid loading, des￾pite return to control values of hemodynamic parameters,
indicates that fluid penetration within interstitial and al￾veolar spaces is a slow process. Third, the investigator
who performed the three transthoracic ultrasound exami￾nations was not aware of any other cardiorespiratory pa￾rameters but was not blind to the protocol timing. An
overestimation of LUS could have then resulted. A ma￾jority of lung ultrasound examinations were recorded. A
posteriori examination of videos by a second investiga￾tor unaware of protocol timing did not reveal any substan￾tial bias. Fourth there are potential sources of error in
counting B lines. Assessment of B lines depends on the

type of probe, wavelength emission frequency and filter
technique for artifact suppression. Therefore, LUS is only
a semiquantitative evaluation of lung water and interstitial
syndrome [32]. Last but not least, the high level of expert￾ise required to detect small changes in LUS together with
operator dependence may limit the clinical applicability of
bedside transthoracic lung ultrasound for determining
detrimental fluid loading.
Conclusions
In summary, when septic shock is associated to ARDS,
fluid loading performed within 48 h of onset transitorily
improves hemodynamics and oxygenation. Ultrasound
and hemodynamic data suggest that fluid loading pro￾duces regional interstitial-alveolar edema caused by an
increase in pulmonary microvascular hydrostatic pres￾sure. Due to the increase in cardiac index and the lack
of increase in pulmonary shunt, arterial oxygenation in￾creases, concealing from the clinician, the deterioration
of lung aeration. As a consequence, transthoracic lung
ultrasound may serve as a safeguard against excessive
fluid loading.
Key messages
 Transthoracic lung ultrasound is a non invasive,
easily repeatable and useful diagnostic tool at the
bedside in critically ill patients.
 At the early phase of ARDS associated with septic
shock, bedside transthoracic lung ultrasound detects
early worsening of lung aeration resulting from fluid
loading.
 Simultaneously, hemodynamics and oxygenation
improve and lung ultrasound may serve as a
safeguard against excessive fluid loading.
Figure 5 Effects of fluid loading on arterial oxygenation in 32
patients with septic shock and acute respiratory distress
syndrome. Individual changes in arterial oxygen tension/fraction of
inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) are represented. Red dots represent
median values. P = 0.005 at the top of the figure indicates a
statistically significant difference between the three time points
using Friedman repeated measures analysis of variance on the ranks.
Comparisons between two time points were performed using the
post hoc Tukey test. *P <0.05, baseline versus end of 1,000 mL
fluid loading.
Figure 6 Effects of fluid loading on cardiac index and
pulmonary arterial blood flow supplying consolidated lung
regions in 32 patients with septic shock and acute respiratory
distress syndrome. (A) Changes in cardiac index and (B) velocity
time-interval of pulmonary arterial flow supplying consolidated
lung regions following a 1,000-mL fluid loading are represented
(mean ± SD or median and interquartile range, 25 to 75% according
to distribution). P <0.001 at the top of the figure indicates a
statistically significant difference between the three time points
using analysis of variance for repeated measures. Comparisons
between two time points were performed using the post hoc Tukey
test. *P <0.05, baseline versus end of a 1,000-mL fluid loading and
the end of 1,000-mL fluid loading versus 40 minutes after the end of
fluid loading.
