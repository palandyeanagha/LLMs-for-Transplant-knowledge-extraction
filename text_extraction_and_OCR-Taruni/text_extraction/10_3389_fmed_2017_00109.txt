Background: Chronic lung allograft dysfunction and its main phenotypes, bronchiolitis 
obliterans syndrome (BOS) and restrictive allograft syndrome (RAS), are major causes 
of mortality after lung transplantation (LT). RAS and early-onset BOS, developing within 
3 years after LT, are associated with particularly inferior clinical outcomes. Prediction 
models for early-onset BOS and RAS have not been previously described.
Methods: LT recipients of the French and Swiss transplant cohorts were eligible for 
inclusion in the SysCLAD cohort if they were alive with at least 2 years of follow-up but 
less than 3 years, or if they died or were retransplanted at any time less than 3 years. 
These patients were assessed for early-onset BOS, RAS, or stable allograft function by 
an adjudication committee. Baseline characteristics, data on surgery, immunosuppres￾sion, and year-1 follow-up were collected. Prediction models for BOS and RAS were 
developed using multivariate logistic regression and multivariate multinomial analysis.
results: Among patients fulfilling the eligibility criteria, we identified 149 stable, 51 BOS, 
and 30 RAS subjects. The best prediction model for early-onset BOS and RAS included 
the underlying diagnosis, induction treatment, immunosuppression, and year-1 class

II donor-specific antibodies (DSAs). Within this model, class II DSAs were associated 
with BOS and RAS, whereas pre-LT diagnoses of interstitial lung disease and chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease were associated with RAS.
conclusion: Although these findings need further validation, results indicate that spe￾cific baseline and year-1 parameters may serve as predictors of BOS or RAS by 3 years 
post-LT. Their identification may allow intervention or guide risk stratification, aiming for 
an individualized patient management approach.

INTRODUCTION
Chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) is the principal cause 
of poor long-term survival in lung transplantation (LT) and, 
although no international consensus definition has been developed 
to date, CLAD refers to the persistent decline of the forced expira￾tory volume in one second (FEV1) that cannot be attributed to a 
specific cause other than chronic graft rejection (1, 2). Bronchiolitis 
obliterans syndrome (BOS) and restrictive allograft syndrome 
(RAS) are considered to be the two main phenotypes of CLAD 
(2, 3). BOS is characterized by persistent airflow obstruction in 
the absence of a restrictive ventilation defect and imaging studies 
that may be unremarkable or show air trapping (4). Early-onset 
BOS, developing within 2 or 3 years after LT, is associated with 
particularly unfavorable outcomes, resulting in high morbidity 
and mortality soon after LT (5, 6). For RAS, various diagnostic 
criteria have been used in different studies, but overall, RAS is 
characterized by a restrictive ventilation defect and radiological 
signs of fibrosis or infiltrates (7–9). Prognosis is worse for RAS 
than BOS, and for RAS, time of diagnosis after transplant does not 
seem to influence survival (10). Diagnosis of BOS or RAS requires 
exclusion of alternative diagnoses, and this may be challenging (1).
Although the pathogenic mechanisms and the risk factors 
implicated in BOS and RAS are not fully elucidated (4, 11), 
recent literature provides increasing evidence and novel insights. 
Concerning BOS, most studies emphasize the role of multiple 
allo-immune and non-immune mechanisms (4, 11–13), but 
information on the risk factors of RAS or a comparative analysis 
of RAS and BOS is limited (10, 14). Identification of clinical risk 
factors associated with specific CLAD phenotypes is of particular 
clinical importance as it may assist patient risk stratification, 
optimize follow-up, or allow early intervention for potentially 
modifiable factors.
Multivariate prediction models are being increasingly 
developed to help health-care providers estimate the prob￾ability of a future disease (15). A few studies described clinical 
predictive models for BOS (16–19), but to our knowledge, no 
study has used this approach for BOS and RAS. The SysCLAD 
(systems prediction of CLAD) study is a collaborative project 
merging data from two large European LT cohorts. It aims 
to develop prediction models for early-onset BOS and RAS 
by implementing a multilevel approach and incorporating 
multiple clinical and laboratory parameters (20). The present 
study concerns the clinical arm of SysCLAD and describes the 
development of a multivariate predictive model for early-onset 
BOS and RAS. Our methodology and findings are reported in 
accordance with the TRIPOD recommendations (15). Some 
of the results of this study have been previously reported as 
conference abstracts (21, 22).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Population
This multicenter cohort study used data from two prospec￾tive European LT cohorts, the French–Belgian Cohort of LT 
(COLT) and the Swiss Transplant Cohort Study (STCS). COLT 
includes 11 French centers (Bordeaux, Grenoble, Lyon, Marseille, 
Nantes, Georges Pompidou Hospital, Hospital Bichat in Paris, 
Centre Chirurgical Marie Lennelongue in Le Plessis-Robinson, 
Strasbourg, Toulouse, Foch Hospital in Suresnes) and the Erasme 
center in Brussels, Belgium. It was established in October 2009. 
STCS is a multicenter cohort collecting data from all Swiss trans￾plant programs (23, 24). The two Swiss LT centers, Zurich and 
Lausanne/Geneva, participate in STCS since its establishment in 
April 2008.
COLT and STCS patients were eligible for the SysCLAD 
cohort if they were alive with at least 2 years of follow-up but less 
than 3 years, or if they died or were retransplanted at any time less 
than 3 years. Only patients with a first LT were included in the 
study. Data collection concerned the periods between October 
2009 (for COLT) or April 2008 (for STCS) and February 2014 
(for both cohorts). Data harmonization, completion, and quality 
control were performed during the following 1.5 years. The cor￾responding national and local ethics committees approved the 
study protocol, and all participants provided written informed 
consent.

Assessment by the Adjudication 
Committee
Outcomes were established by an adjudication committee of LT 
specialists (Antoine Magnan, Christophe Pison, Antoine Roux, 
Martine L. Reynaud-Gaubert, Laurent P. Nicod, John D. Aubert, 
and Christian Benden) who evaluated pulmonary function tests 
(PFTs), imaging studies, and confounding factors. This commit￾tee formed a group opinion and identified LT recipients who 
remained stable or developed a definite BOS or RAS. Actions 
to blind assessment included data anonymization and an initial 
evaluation of the PFTs before assessment of imaging studies and 
confounding factors.
Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome was defined as the persistent 
drop of FEV1 in the absence of a restrictive defect and in the absence 
of confounding factors (4, 8). RAS was defined as the persistent 
decline of FEV1 in the presence of a restrictive defect [i.e., decline 
of total lung capacity (TLC) and/or forced vital capacity (FVC)] 
and in the absence of confounding factors (8, 25). Imaging studies 
compatible with RAS were used as an additional diagnostic crite￾rion. Patients were censored either at death/retransplantation or 
they were scored as uncensored at their last available assessment 
between 2 and 3 years of follow-up. More details on the elements 
assessed are presented below.
Pulmonary Function Tests
In addition to specific time-point values recorded in the databases, 
PFTs were retrieved from LT centers. Spirometry was performed 
at every patient visit. The frequency of TLC measurements varied 
among centers: Zurich conducted TLC measurements at each 
patient visit, whereas in other centers, this was done at predefined 
assessment visits and when clinically indicated.
All hospitals calibrated their spirometers and body plethys￾mographers routinely according to the ATS/ERS guidelines. 
Home spirometry measurements were not used for diagnostic 
purposes in the present study. All pediatric patients included 
were able to perform PFTs reliably.
Imaging Studies
Chest X-rays and chest CT scans of patients with declining PFTs 
were assessed to identify confounding factors for this decline or to 
support the PFT-based diagnosis of BOS or RAS. Unremarkable 
imaging studies or signs of air trapping (4) were considered sup￾portive of BOS, whereas fibrosis, pleural thickening, or infiltrates 
in the absence of a confirmed infection were considered sup￾portive of RAS (8, 25).
Confounding Factors
Before establishing the diagnosis of BOS or RAS, we excluded 
allograft or extra-allograft factors that could cause the decline of 
PFTs (1, 4). Anastomotic, parenchymal, or thoracic wall abnor￾malities were identified using imaging studies and bronchoscopy 
reports. Whenever necessary, LT centers were contacted to obtain 
additional information.
Establishment of the Diagnosis
A flow chart diagram of the assessed population is shown in 
Figure 1. During level-1 analysis, FEV1 baseline was calculated 
as the mean of the two best FEV1 measured 3 weeks apart. At the 
last assessment time-point, FEV1% of baseline was calculated to 
identify two groups of patients: (1) LT recipients without a per￾sistent FEV1 decline (stable patients) and (2) LT recipients with 
a persistent decline of FEV1 < 80% of baseline. In the absence of 
confounding factors the diagnosis of CLAD was established and 
PFTs within 6 months were assessed to confirm the diagnosis.
During level-2 analysis, among CLAD cases, a decline of TLC 
to <90% of baseline was used to indicate RAS (8). When the 
number of available TLC values was insufficient for a confident 
diagnosis, a decline of FVC to <80% of baseline was used in 
combination with compatible imaging studies. For RAS cases, 
the FEV1/FVC ratio was calculated to identify a purely restrictive 
(≥0.70) or mixed ventilation defect (ratio <0.70). The final study 
population was re-assessed for an improvement of FEV1 of ≥10% 
after 3 months of macrolide therapy.
Patients were characterized as “Not stable/No definite CLAD” 
if: (1) they were not stable but did not have CLAD, i.e., deceased 
or retransplanted patients for causes other than CLAD (including 
patients who died within 3  months after LT) and (2) they had 
one or more confounding factors contributing to the decrease 
of PFTs. Cases with confounding factors were assessed in detail 
by the adjudication committee and whenever possible patient 
evolution was followed over time. These cases were characterized 
as “no definite CLAD” when the predefined diagnostic criteria of 
BOS or RAS were not met despite this detailed assessment. After 
this evaluation, three groups (stable, BOS, and RAS) were created 
and used as outcomes for the multivariate models.
Collection of Predictors
Clinical variables were chosen for their relevance regarding 
CLAD (1, 12), and subsequent data harmonization targeted 
to overcome discrepancies between the cohorts and among 
different centers. With a focus on those objectives, the follow￾ing variables were collected and served as predictors in the 
multivariate models: (a) recipients’ baseline characteristics, 
(b) donors’ baseline characteristics, (c) data on induction treat￾ment and surgery, and (d) data on follow-up: stage 3 primary 
graft dysfunction (PGD), maintenance immunosuppression, 
number of treated acute cellular rejection episodes during year 
1 (Y1 t-AR), number of treated infections during year 1 (Y1 
t-infections), number of treated CMV infections during year 1 
(Y1 t-CMV), and donor-specific antibodies (DSAs). Details for 
specific variables are provided below.
Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) mismatches concerned 
the sum of A1, A2, B1, B2, DR1, and DR2 mismatches between 
recipients and donors (maximum possible sum: 6). Baseline DQ 
mismatches were not included in this sum as they were not avail￾able for all patients since the creation of the two cohorts.
Regarding PGD, for each patient, the worse stage developing 
within the first 72 h post-operatively (26, 27) is captured in the 
databases. Charts were reviewed to confirm accurate characteri￾zation according to established criteria (PaO2/FiO2 ratio < 200, 
radiological infiltrates and/or ECMO). Although we were able to 
confirm severe PGD, milder PGD stages were difficult to estab￾lish unequivocally in all cases and for that reason they were not 
included in the analysis.

Y1 t-AR refers to the total number of treated events of grade 
A rejection or lymphocytic bronchiolitis (biopsy proven or 
clinically suspected). For harmonization reasons, we used this 
parameter instead of the cumulative A score [the latter depended 
on the frequency of conducted biopsies and the occurrence of Ax 
(inconclusive) results which were variable among centers].
Y1 t-infections refer to the total number of treated microbial, 
viral, and fungal infections (pulmonary and extra-pulmonary). Data 
collection especially for viral infections was not consistent between 
the databases and among centers, and for this reason, we did not use 
this variable. However, data on treated infections (including treated 
CMV infections) were recorded consistently and in detail.
Donor-specific antibody measurements were conducted at 
each study center. In order to alleviate methodological discrepan￾cies, DSAs were considered positive when the result was validated 
as such by the corresponding immunology laboratory and no 
unique cut-off for mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) was used 
(Table S1 in Supplementary Material).
For some parameters, clinical practices, definitions, or data 
collection were very heterogeneous or inconsistent among cent￾ers, not allowing harmonization under one common definition. 
These parameters did not pass the quality control to be included 
in the analysis and were considered missing variables. Diagnosis 
of antibody-mediated rejection was not possible to establish 
with certainty for all patients since the creation of the cohorts, 
not only due to the evolving definition criteria but also due to 
the variability of clinical practices among centers and over time. 
The lack of an international standardization during data collec￾tion [International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation 
(ISHLT) guideline published in 2016 (28)] led to subsequent 
discrepancies in the interpretation and management of positive 
results. Investigations and definitions of gastroesophageal reflux 
varied significantly among centers, depending on different local 
clinical practices and era of transplant. For that reason, it was not 
possible to harmonize this variable under one common definition.
Data Quality Control and Harmonization
Data quality control strategies were implemented by three teams: 
(a) COLT coordinators, COLT datacenter (Informatique Données 
Base Centralisées—IDBC, St Luce/Loire), (b) STCS coordinators, 
STCS datacenter (Basel, Switzerland), and (c) SysCLAD coordi￾nators, SysCLAD datacenter (Biomax, Germany).
Within each cohort, data were collected prospectively by 
the clinical research assistants according to the cohort-specific 
data dictionary and a predefined acquisition methodology. The 
corresponding datacenters conducted regular, automatic data 
quality validation assessments including but not restricted to: 
completeness, availability of the required data, data type check, 
data ranges based on realistic expected values, and rule-based 
inconsistency checks (e.g., diagnosis of “stable” is in conflict with 
an FEV1 < 80% of baseline). Database coordinators addressed 
datacenter originating queries to verify or complete data.
To identify inconsistencies in the definitions and in data 
completion between COLT and STCS, a harmonization work￾ing group (Christophe Pison, Laurent P. Nicod, Pierre J. Royer, 
Angela Koutsokera, and Andreas Fritz) defined which data were 
sufficiently harmonized, which needed refinement or completion 
before achieving harmonization, and which were not possible to 
harmonize (latter considered as missing variables). The conclu￾sions and suggestions of this working team were presented 
at a regular basis to the SysCLAD consortium members who 
validated the final decisions. Details on the collected clinical 
parameters, quality control, and missing variables are reported 
in Tables S1–S3 in Supplementary Material.
Statistical Analysis
Continuous variables were reported as median (IQR) and cat￾egorical as n (%). Mann–Whitney U-test was used for two-group 
comparisons, Kruskal–Wallis for three groups, and chi-square for 
categorical variables.
Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses 
(LRAs) were used to develop a prediction model for early-onset 
CLAD. Univariate and multivariate multinomial analyses were 
used to develop a prediction model for early-onset BOS or RAS. 
Independent explanatory variables were identified by backward–
forward and forward–backward elimination techniques (29). The 
entry and removal criteria from the equation were a probability 
of likelihood ratio <0.05 and >0.10, respectively. The “center of 
transplantation” was coded as an indicator variable and, during 
multivariate analysis, systematically forced into the model as one 
of the explanatory variables to provide adjustment for center 
effect. For model performance and to test the overall fit of the 
models, we used the Hosmer–Lemeshow goodness-of-fit and 
the R2
 (Cox–Snell and McFadden) tests. Results were reported as 
odds ratios (ORs, 95% CI).
Variables of the best performing multivariate LRA model were 
used to create a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The 
equation for the prediction of CLAD corresponding to this ROC 
curve was created for the studied population. Probabilities of stabil￾ity, BOS, or RAS were calculated for all modalities of each significant 
independent variable in the multivariate multinomial analysis.
Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to identify risk fac￾tors for mortality in the studied population. Variables with p-value of 
0.1 or less in the univariate analysis were included in the multivariate 
model. A backward/forward selection procedure with Akaike infor￾mation criterion was used to identify risk factors for mortality, and 
survival curves were obtained from Kaplan–Meier estimates.
Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05. All statistical 
analyses were performed using R 3.2.0 and SPSS 22 software 
versions.
RESULTS
Study Population and Subgroups of 
Patients
As shown in Figure  1, from 1,263 LT included in COLT and 
STCS, 422 adult and pediatric recipients fulfilled the SysCLAD 
eligibility criteria. Following adjudication, a definite diagnosis was 
established for 230 subjects, transplanted in 12 different centers, 
and these patients were analyzed further. Patients’ characteristics 
are presented in Table 1.
The following groups were analyzed: (1) stable recipients 
(n = 149), CLAD (n = 81), and (2) CLAD patients were further

subcategorized as BOS (51) or RAS (n = 30). Among the BOS 
patients, 17.6% were stage 1, 29.4% stage 2, and 53% stage 3. 
Concerning RAS, 37% (n =  11) had a FEV1/FVC ratio <0.70 
indicating a mixed pattern (example case in Supplementary 
Material).
The final study population was assessed for an FEV1 improve￾ment of at least 10% after 3 months of macrolide therapy (either 
azithromycin or clarithromycin). FEV1 of all CLAD patients 
remained below the 80% of baseline threshold, but six (7.4%) had 
a reversibility of at least 10% after 3 months of macrolides. Within 
the stable population, 74 (49.7%) received macrolides for at least 
3  months (either for a non-sustained decline of FEV1 after an 
acute event, or as part of a treatment for non-tuberculous myco￾bacteria). Twenty-two patients (14.8% of the stable patients) had 
an improvement of at least 10% of FEV1 at 3 months of treatment. 
In all stable patients, FEV1 remained above the 80% of baseline 
threshold. In macrolide-responsive cases, the improvement of 
FEV1 could not be attributed to macrolides alone, since during 
the same period, most patients had concomitant treatments for a 
viral or bacterial infection or an acute cellular rejection.
Among the CLAD patients, 35 died (for 19, BOS or RAS was the 
main cause of death) and 8 were retransplanted (5 due to BOS and

147 patients who died or were retransplanted for causes other than 
CLAD and 45 patients with at least 1 confounding factor contribut￾ing to the decrease of FEV1 and/or TLC (detailed in Figure 1).
Model Development and Model 
Regression Diagnostics
The parameters tested by backward–forward and forward–
backward elimination techniques to identify independent explana￾tory variables were the following: recipient’s age, donor’s age, differ￾ence of recipient and donor’s age, underlying diagnosis, recipient’s 
smoking history before LT, recipient’s body mass index (BMI), stage 
3 PGD, max cold ischemia time, number of HLA mismatches, induc￾tion treatment, maintenance immunosuppression (cyclosporine vs. 
tacrolimus), Y1 t-AR, Y1 t-infections, Y1 t-CMV infections, DSAs 
before LT, Y1 DSAs, Y1 DSAs class I, and Y1 DSAs class II.
For the analyzed parameters, only a small number of data was 
missing (Table S2 in Supplementary Material). Single imputation 
was used to handle missing data. For nominal variables, missing 
values were replaced by the variable mode (i.e., most frequent 
value), and for numerical variables, missing values were replaced 
by the median value. The only exception was “DSAs before LT” 
which had the most missing data (23 of 230). In this case, missing 
data were coded as unknown.
For induction treatment, we used “basiliximab” as the baseline 
and for “underlying diagnosis” we chose “CF.” For the former, a 
preliminary exploratory univariate analysis using “none” as the 
baseline did not provide statistically significant differences [basi￾liximab vs. none OR (95% CI) 0.882 (0.763, 1.020), p = 0.09 and 
rabbit antithymocyte globulin (rATG) vs. none 1.113 (0.941, 1.315), 
p= 0.214]. We considered that the statistically significant difference 
observed using basiliximab as the baseline was of clinical interest. In 
addition, basiliximab was the most frequently used induction agent 
within this study (Table S3 in Supplementary Material). The choice 
of CF as the baseline for the “underlying diagnosis” was done for 
the same reasons (statistical significant results in the preliminary 
analysis, most frequent diagnosis in the study population). We con￾sidered that this comparison would be of particular clinical interest.
With regard to model regression diagnostics: (a) the dependent 
variable was either binary (stable, BOS) or ordinal (stable, BOS, 
and RAS), (b) the dependent variables were coded appropriately, 
(c) the model fitted correctly after using a stepwise method, the 
Hosmer–Lemeshow goodness-of-fit and the R2
 test, (d) the data 
originated from independent samples (no paired samples) and we 
used the stepwise approach to avoid multicollinearity, (e) linearity 
of independent variables and log odds was observed in the graph￾ics diagnostics, and (f) we used a sample size of 230 cases to test 
18 variables (i.e., more than 10 samples per independent variable).

model for early-onset CLAD were used to create a multivariate 
prediction model for estimating probability of developing early￾onset CLAD. The variables included recipient age, underlying 
diagnosis, induction treatment and presence of Y1 class II DSAs, 
and the prediction model generated a ROC curve (Figure 2A) 
with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.766. The equation cor￾responding to this ROC curve, its limitations, and some clinical 
examples for the prediction of early-onset CLAD in the studied 
population are presented in Table S4 in Supplementary Material. 
The ROC curve of the same model but without using Y1 class II 
DSA provided an AUC = 0.730. The difference between the AUC 
of the complete model and the model without Y1 class II DSA did 
not reach statistical significance (p = 0.074, Figure 2B).
Of note, increasing recipient age had a weak protective effect 
over CLAD development (OR 0.971, p = 0.102 in the multivariate 
LRA, factor −0.03 in the ROC curve equation). A graphic repre￾sentation of early-onset CLAD diagnosis according to recipient 
age showed a tendency for a U-shaped distribution. However, 
when the recipients’ age was tested for a quadratic (i.e., non￾linear) effect, p-value was not statistically significant (Figure S1 
in Supplementary Material).
Prediction Models for Early-Onset BOS
or RAS
Tables 3 and 4 present the results of the univariate and multivari￾ate multinomial analysis. The multivariate multinomial predic￾tive model included the underlying diagnosis, maintenance 
immunosuppression, induction treatment, and Y1 class II DSAs. 
Within the model, Y1 class II DSAs were associated with BOS 
(OR 3.83) and RAS (OR 6.97). Compared to CF, interstitial lung 
disease/idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (ILD/IPF) (OR 5.47) and 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (OR 3.86) were 
associated with a higher risk for RAS. Induction treatment and 
maintenance immunosuppression were included in the best 
prediction model, although they were not statistically significant. 
Probabilities for BOS and RAS for each significant independent 
variable are shown in Figure 3.
Survival Analysis
Risk factors for mortality within 3 years after LT are shown in 
Table S5 in Supplementary Material, and survival curves obtained 
from Kaplan–Meier estimates are displayed in Figure S2 in 
Supplementary Material. In the multivariate analysis, the recipi￾ent previous smoking status, a diagnosis of IPF/ILD as compared 
to a diagnosis of CF, the sum of HLA mismatches, and the pres￾ence of DSA during year 1 (either class I or II) were associated 
with a higher risk of mortality.
DISCUSSION
This study analyzed clinical data of two large European LT 
cohorts aiming to develop multivariate prediction models for 
early-onset BOS or RAS. The created models provide prob￾abilities for a binary outcome (stable vs. CLAD), not taking into 
account the probability of being in the “not stable/not CLAD” 
group. Our main findings are: first, the multivariate prediction 
model for CLAD included recipient age, underlying diagnosis, 
type of induction treatment, and Y1 class II DSAs. A model, 
using baseline variables only (i.e., exclusion of Y1 class II DSAs), 
had a predictive capacity similar to the complete model. Second, 
the multivariate prediction models for BOS and RAS included 
underlying diagnosis, type of induction treatment, maintenance 
immunosuppression, and Y1 class II DSAs, but were not identi￾cal. Year-1 class II DSAs were associated with both BOS and 
RAS, whereas pre-LT diagnoses of ILD/IPF and COPD were 
associated with RAS.

Establishment of a definite diagnosis of BOS or RAS is often 
challenging. Despite the detailed evaluation by the adjudication 
committee, 10% (n = 45) of the assessed patients had confound￾ing factors not allowing a definite diagnosis. For the differential 
diagnosis of BOS and RAS, TLC is considered the gold standard; 
however, in case of insufficient TLC values, FVC may be used 
(1, 8, 25). Imaging studies are not included in the current diag￾nostic algorithms, but may support or contradict the PFT-based 
diagnosis. This may be particularly helpful when FVC decrease 
is associated with air trapping (pseudo-restriction) (30). The 
isolated evaluation of the FEV1/FVC ratio in these cases may 
be misleading and not allow identification of mixed ventilation 
defects. In our study, 37% (n = 11) of RAS patients had an FEV1/
FVC ratio <0.70 suggesting a mixed PFTs pattern.
Prognostic prediction models for LT outcomes may assist 
patient risk stratification and improve follow-up strategies. 
Some previously described predictive models identified donor￾specific risk factors for BOS (age ≥60 years, high PaO2, smoking,

pulmonary infection, and HLA mismatch) (16) or recipient￾related acute events occurring during follow-up (acute cellular 
rejection, infections, and fungal pathogens) (18, 19) as risk factors 
for BOS. So far, no study described a prediction model specifically 
for early-onset BOS and RAS. In our study, although factors of the 
BOS and RAS models were the same, significant differences were 
observed within the models. Y1 class II DSAs were associated 
with RAS and BOS, but the OR were 6.97 and 3.83, respectively. 
Compared to CF, ILD/IPF was COPD were associated with RAS. 
In the univariate analysis, use of rATG (vs. basiliximab) was a 
statistically significant risk factor for BOS, whereas tacrolimus 
was protective for RAS. Although neither induction nor main￾tenance immunosuppression were statistically significant in the 
prediction model, they both participated in it.
To date, no definite association between BOS development 
and underlying diagnoses has been established, but a shorter 
time to BOS has been reported for emphysema patients as 
compared to CF (31). Interestingly, IPF was associated with 
worse pulmonary function after BOS onset (32) and patients 
undergoing retransplantation for RAS were less likely to have CF 
and more likely to have IPF (33). In our study, as compared to 
CF, ILD/IPF (OR 5.467) and COPD (OR 3.857) were associated 
with RAS. To our knowledge, the later finding regarding COPD 
has not been previously described. Further studies are needed 
to confirm the underlying mechanisms of this association, but it 
can be hypothesized that pathological remodeling processes, as, 
for example, TGF-β signaling pathways or circulating fibroblasts, 
associated with ILD/IPF (34, 35) or COPD (36–39), may persist 
or be activated in some patients after LT and thus contribute to 
the higher risk of RAS.
Concerning recipients’ age and CLAD, different cutoff points 
have been used with discordant results (40–43). Data from the 

11
Koutsokera et al. Prediction Models for Early-Onset BOS and RAS
Frontiers in Medicine | www.frontiersin.org July 2017 | Volume 4 | Article 109
ISHLT Registry showed that 5-year incidence of BOS was 35.9% 
in pediatric and 41% adult patients (44, 45). In our study, the 
pediatric population was too small (3.5%) to be analyzed sepa￾rately. A graphic representation of early-onset CLAD diagnosis 
according to recipient age showed a tendency for a U-shaped 
distribution, but this was not statistically significant. In the final 
model, increasing recipient age had a weak protective effect 
for CLAD, suggesting that age-related factors, such as worse 
adherence in children and adolescents or functional changes in 
the immune system during growth, may influence alloreactivity 
(46, 47). However, recipients’ age was not a component of the 
best predictive model for BOS or RAS. Regarding donors’ age, 
it was not associated with BOS/RAS or mortality; and, although 
literature is inconclusive (31, 48, 49), the observed lack of associa￾tion in our cohort study is reassuring in regard to current donor 
selection criteria.
Evidence is not conclusive concerning induction treatment 
and the risk for CLAD (42, 43, 50–53), but recent data indicate 
that induction with basiliximab (or alemtuzumab) may be 
protective against BOS (54). In our study, use of basiliximab, as 
compared to rATG was also protective against BOS. It may be 
assumed that center effect or patient selection bias (e.g., high-risk 
patients receiving rATG) could account for the observed results. 
However, this factor remained significant even after controlling 
for center effect and independently of other perioperative risk 
factors (pre-LT DSAs, HLA mismatches, or cold ischemia time). 
Based on our results, causality cannot be established, but differ￾ences in the mechanisms of action of these molecules may explain 
our findings. The characteristics of post-depletion T cells and the 
susceptibility of individual T-cell subsets may vary between these 
agents (55–59). These results need to be further investigated as 
they concern a potentially modifiable factor.
Growing evidence suggests that DSAs are a risk factor for BOS 
and BOS-related mortality (31, 60, 61). DSAs that develop early 
after LT and persistent DSAs have been associated with worse 
outcomes (31). In our study, detection of type II DSAs at least once 
during year-1 was a risk factor of CLAD, BOS, and RAS consist￾ently. As previously mentioned, important discrepancies existed in 
DSA measurements among different centers, reflecting a common 
problem of multicenter studies. In order to alleviate these discrep￾ancies, we used the interpretation of the corresponding specialized 
laboratory rather than MFI cutoff points. Ongoing data collection 
in our cohort, specifically focusing on this parameter, is expected 
to provide additional information on this factor.
In line with evidence from transplantation of other solid 
organs, recent studies indicate that total HLA mismatches are 
associated with an increased risk for CLAD (54, 62). Hayes et al. 
described an increased risk for BOS, with HLA-A mismatches 
being associated with a greater hazard (54), whereas Walton et al. 
demonstrated the importance of eplet mismatches as a risk factor 
for RAS (62). In our study, HLA mismatches were an independent 
risk factor of mortality in the multivariate model but not for BOS 
or RAS. The observed discrepancy in these results may be due 
to differences in the definition of HLA mismatches and notably 
the non-inclusion of baseline DQ mismatches in our study since 
they were not available for all patients since the creation of the 
two cohorts.
Concerning other parameters, such as BMI (54), infections 
(63), or stage 3 PGD (64) and their association with BOS or 
RAS, data are limited. Clear associations may be hampered by 
the use of preemptive therapy or the decreased number of severe 
PGD survivors studied longitudinally. Acute cellular rejections 
(42, 65) and lymphocytic bronchiolitis (14, 66, 67) have been 
associated with BOS, but different definitions have been used 
in the literature. Concerning maintenance immunosuppression, 
two prospective studies showed a higher risk of BOS for cyclo￾sporine vs. tacrolimus (68, 69). In our study, none of these clinical 
parameters had statistically significant associations with CLAD, 
with the exception of BMI and tacrolimus. BMI was associated 
with RAS in the univariate analysis but not in the multivariate 
analysis. For tacrolimus, a protective effect over RAS was shown 
in the univariate analysis, and this variable participated in the 
multivariate prediction model. Finally, for harmonization 
purposes, Y1-treated acute cellular rejections and lymphocytic 
bronchiolitis were studied together and Y1 t-AR was not an 
independent risk factor for BOS or RAS.
Our study has limitations. First, the choice of a 2-year 
minimum follow-up resulted in the exclusion of a large patient 
population from both cohorts. Although this approach may be 
associated with a patient selection bias, it allowed an unequivocal 
diagnosis in a number of patients sufficient for the construction 
of the models, while avoiding a bias associated with diagnostic 
uncertainty. Second, a specific time-point analysis was chosen 
over a time-dependent design to facilitate the subsequent mul￾tilevel clinical and laboratory data integration of the SysCLAD 
project. Follow-up was limited at 3 years because the main focus 
was early-onset CLAD. Although for RAS outcome seems to be 
inferior independently of the time-point of onset after LT, early 
BOS development has been associated with worse outcomes 
compared to late-onset BOS. Collectively, early-onset CLAD 
is associated with increased morbidity and mortality making 
the identification of associated risk factors even more clinically 
relevant. Finally, although there was not a significant number of 
missing values during model construction, very heterogeneous 
variables were not possible to harmonize (missing variables). 
These discrepancies reflect daily clinical practice and need to be 
taken into account when designing and analyzing multicenter 
databases. Adjudication of study patients and rigorous data har￾monization are two of the main strengths of this project which 
differentiate it from registry studies handling more heterogeneous 
and difficult to control data (70). These results will need valida￾tion in a separate group of patients for whom data collection is 
ongoing within both cohorts.
In conclusion, the initial clinical data analysis of the 
SysCLAD cohort identified clinical factors as potential predic￾tors of early-onset CLAD within 3 years post-LT. Among these 
factors, the underlying diagnosis, induction treatment, and the 
presence of Y1 class II DSAs were consistently associated with 
the development of CLAD and its main phenotypes, BOS or 
RAS. Validation of these results in subsequent patient popula￾tions and integration in the ongoing genetic, biological, and 
microbiological analyses of the SysCLAD project may assist 
patient risk stratification allowing a better understanding of the 
mechanisms propagating CLAD.
