do septo mucoso entre a cavidade abscedada peri-bolsa 
gástrica e a própria luz do órgão (septotomia ou septoplastia 
ou “drenagem endoscópica interna”). Ela foi realizada com 
catéter de argônio a 2 l/m e 90 w , afim de evitar sangramento 
desta área inflamada e hipervascularizada (Figura 3). O dreno 
que comunicava a cavidade peri-bolsa com a pele foi retirado 
no mesmo procedimento por considerar-se epitelizado o 
trajeto fistuloso pelo tempo de evolução da fístula. A dieta 
líquida foi iniciada em 24 h.
FIGURE 3 - Evolution of the healing process: A) initial

opening; B) final appearance in endoscopic 
control on day 30 post-septotomy
Endoscopic control was done after five days for completion 
of septoplasty with argon, observation of the incisura angularis and 
if the gastric pouch axis was already rectified. The fistula stopped 
draining to the skin on the 7th day after the start of endoscopic 
treatment. The pre-endoscopic cavity formed by the fistula had its 
full resolution at 30 days (Figure 3), although the patient already 
carry out her activities and feeding with no problems.
DISCUSSION
Currently the author has treated 10 such cases with 
complete resolution in all no later than 60 days after the start 
of endoscopic treatment. 
The proposed combination - dilation and septotomy with 
argon - unlike other services of bariatric endoscopy over the 
country, allows earlier resolution of post-sleeve gastrectomy 
fistulas, thus reducing the length of hospital stay, the need for 
enteral nutritional support or prolonged parenteral nutrition, 
as well as the need for reoperation and the risk of unfavorable 
outcome. The author do not makes the opening of the fistula 
before the 30th postoperative day, because before this time 
there is the possibility of inexistence of healing blockage of 
the fistula area and the risk of penetration into free abdominal 
cavity with endoscopic devices. Generally with the more 
“forced” dilations mucosal laceration may occurs, but with only 
minor bleeding, not requiring hemostasis.

INTRODUCTION
Obesity is a major public health problem 
worldwide; a quarter of the world’s population 
is in the range of overweight and 10% are 
considered obese. In Brazil, half the population is overweight 
(BMI>25 kg/m2
) and 17.5% is obese (BMI>30 kg/m2
)
1
. Bariatric 
surgery is the most effective method of treatment of severe 
or morbid obesity (BMI>40 kg/m2
 or BMI>35 kg/m2
 with 
comorbidities), presenting superior results with respect to 
weight loss, control of comorbidities, improved quality of 
life and survival compared to medical treatment2
. 
Hepatobiliary complex interventions in severely obese patients 
are associated with increased risk of bleeding, postoperative 
complications and mortality, due to the technical difficulty 
(exposure) and higher incidence of clinical comorbidities3

Morbid obesity is a relative contraindication to liver 
transplantation for the same reasons. Furthermore, long￾term survival of transplanted obese patients is also reduced. 
Nevertheless, in the United States, 7% of patients undergoing 
liver transplantation are obese4
. Some centers determine 
BMI less than 35 as a precondition for liver transplantation5
. 
Furthermore, up to one third of patients undergoing 
liver transplantation become obese within three years 
postoperatively. The factors associated to this phenomenon 
are: sedentary lifestyle, improvement of appetite, change in 
eating habits (abandonment of the pre-transplant rigid diet), 
history of obesity and use of immunosuppressant, particularly 
corticosteroids6
. Part of these individuals may become morbidly 
obese, and in some cases the development of steatosis in the 
transplanted liver, may even compromise the function of the 
graft. In this situation there is also an increase in the incidence of 
other comorbidities, such as type II diabetes. Patient education 
and dietary treatment are the key measures of prevention 
and treatment of obesity after liver transplantation7
. In some 
situations, bariatric surgery may be indicated in order to delay 
or inhibit this evolution. There are few studies on the surgical 
treatment of morbid obesity after liver transplantation, all 
made in small series8,9,10. 
Here is reported the case of one patient who 
underwent a laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy 15 months 
after orthotopic liver transplantation, who developed stenosis 
of the biliary anastomosis and weight gain postoperatively. 
CASE REPORT
 Female of 33 years old with a history of obesity since 
childhood, was submitted in December 2012 to a liver transplant 
by piggyback technique, cadaver donor for autoimmune 
hepatitis and hepatitis C. The MELD score was 31; the patient 
had ascites and was admitted for treatment of spontaneous 
bacterial peritonitis and clinical compensation for two weeks 
prior to the transplant. In the day before the transplantation, 
she has shown little swelling, her weight was 106 kg, height 1.69 
m and BMI 37.1 kg/m2
. She received 10U of cryoprecipitate, 
10 platelet apheresis and 650 ml of autotransfusion through 
the cell saver. The early postoperative outcome was without 
any clinical or surgical complications. In the late postoperative 
period (after three months) she started to gain weight, reaching 
134 kg after 10 months (BMI=47 kg/m2
), associated with onset 
of hypertension and type II diabetes. She has received dietary 
counseling, managing to reach 112 kg (BMI=39 kg/m2
) and 
stabilizing at that level, with partial improvement of diabetes 
and hypertension (still in need of medication for the treatment 
of both). Concomitantly, the patient developed stenosis of 
the biliary anastomosis, initially treated by percutaneous 
external drainage and later by combined internal and external 
drainage (rendezvous). For the definitive treatment of the biliary 
stenosis, a coledochal-jejunal anastomosis was proposed. Due 
to the degree of obesity presented by the patient, presence of 
comorbidities and risk of reoperation on the biliary tract in obese 
patients, bariatric surgery was proposed, so that the patient 
could have good weight loss, better control of comorbidities 
and better surgical conditions for the revisional procedure on 
the bile duct. After 15 months of transplantation, the patient 
underwent a laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. The operation 
began by lysis of adhesions and the separation of the left lobe 
of the liver, firmly attached to the anterior wall of the stomach 
(Figure 1). Stapling was started at 4.0 cm from the pylorus, and a 
32 Fr “bougie” was used for calibration. Was used green cartridge 
for the first staple line (Ethicon®), gold for the second and blue 
in three subsequent shots (five in total, all 60 mm). Oversuture 
of the staple line was held with Vicryl® 2.0 line, a distance of 
about 5 cm from the esophagogastric angle, and thereafter 
continuous transfixing suture of the staple line (hemostatic) until 
the end of it (Figure 2). Was performed fixation of the omentum 
along the staple line with the objective of reducing adhesions 
and help prevent rotation of the stomach and drained the cavity 
with silicone tube. The surgical time was 120 minutes, anesthetic 
time of 150 minutes. There was no need for transfusions and 
the patient had a good postoperative course. The abdominal 
drain was removed on the 7th day after radiological evidence 
of the absence of fistula. There was good food adaptation and 
resumption of oral immunosuppressive medication from the 2nd
postoperative day. The patient has lost 30 kg during the first 150 
days post-operatively, which represented 75% of excess weight. 
There was good control of diabetes and hypertension, with 
discontinuation of medication for both. There was no change 
in liver function throughout evolution, so far. The definitive 
treatment of the biliary stenosis through biliary-digestive 
anastomosis is now being programmed.

liver to the anterior gastric wall

DISCUSSION 
In recent years, improvements in perioperative care has 
enabled an increase in survival of transplant patients, which 
reaches levels of 85 to 90% at one year and 70-80% after 
five years in high volume centers11. Nevertheless, the impact 
of obesity on long-term results of liver transplantation has 
become increasingly evident, associated with recurrence of 
NASH and increased incidence of diabetes, dyslipidemia and 
cardiovascular disease, jeopardizing the survival of these 
patients12. In this sense, although it is a big risk, treating obesity 
in these patients is warranted, including surgical procedures. 
For this reason, Heinbach et al.13 performed orthotopic liver 
transplants associated with sleeve gastrectomy in seven patients 
with BMI>35 kg/m2
. There was one fistula, with good evolution, 
and no mortality or graft loss in any case. No patient developed 
steatosis or type II diabetes in the late follow-up. In the other 
hand, in a group of 34 patients with similar characteristics, 
submitted to isolated transplantation, steatosis was observed 
in 12/34, and type II diabetes has been diagnosed in 21/34 
patients13. Others have used the same technique in obese 
patients in a liver transplantation program, but prior to the 
transplant, with low morbidity and no mortality14,15. In the

presented case, the patient was obese since childhood and 
unresponsive to dietary treatment. She was transplanted with a 
high BMI, but in a situation that would certainly not enable prior 
treatment for weight loss, given the complications (ascites, SBP) 
and high MELD. 
Sariatric surgery after liver transplantation was first 
described by García Duchini and Brunson in 20018
, who 
performed conventional gastric bypass in two patients, with 
good results (weight loss, normalization of blood glucose levels, 
regression of steatosis). The first case of laparoscopic gastric 
bypass was described by Tichanski and Madan in 2005, also with 
a good outcome15. However, a retrospective study conducted 
at the University of Minnesota, which evaluated seven patients 
who underwent conventional bypass after liver transplantation 
between 2001 and 20099
, revealed that two patients died 
six and nine months after bariatric surgery of multiple organ 
failure and metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, 
respectively. Another patient had the operation reversed for 
severe malnutrition and four patients had good results (57%).
More recently, Lin et al.10 performed sleeve 
gastrectomy in nine patients with a past of liver transplantation, 
eight by videolaparoscopy and one by laparotomy. The mean 
operative time was 165 min and the mean hospital stay was five 
days. One patient operated by videolaparoscopy developed a 
biliary fistula from the liver surface and required reoperation 
for drainage; and another had postoperative dysphagia which 
was also treated surgically. There was no mortality. Eli et al.16
performed the same procedure by robotics, with good results. 
In this case, the most laborious surgical time was certainly 
detachment of the left lobe of the liver adhered to the anterior 
wall of the stomach. Was carry out drainage routinely in 
patients undergoing sleeve gastrectomy because is believed 
that it can contribute to the early diagnosis of a fistula, avoid 
reoperation and it do not add morbidity to the procedure. 
The small number of studies and cases operated in the 
described situation, do not allow a conclusion or consensus 
as to the optimal bariatric technique after liver transplant. 
Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is associated with malabsorption of 
micronutrients (iron, calcium, zinc, copper) and vitamins (B12 
and D) and can affect the absorption of immunosuppressive 
drugs, which could theoretically compromise the evolution 
of the patients17. The adjustable gastric band, which has 
also been used18 is the insertion of a foreign body that can 
cause an increased risk of infection in immunocompromised 
patients. Sleeve gastrectomy has occupied the space of the 
adjustable gastric band, promotes greater weight loss, do 
not demand the maintenance required by the band and also 
does not compromise the absorption of either nutrients 
or medications19. For this reason, it has been the preferred 
technique by most authors for the treatment of morbid obesity 
in patients with liver disease before or after liver transplantation. 
However, more studies are needed to assess the progress and 
long-term complications in transplant patients undergoing 
bariatric surgery, as well as the best technique for treating this 
group of patients.
