Abstract
Background: Macrolides reduce exacerbations in patients with COPD. Their effects on health status has not been
assessed as primary outcome and is less clear. This study assessed the effects of prophylactic azithromycin on
cough-specific health status in COPD-patients with chronic productive cough.
Methods: In this randomised controlled trial 84 patients met the eligibility criteria: age of ≥40 years, COPD GOLD
stage ≥2 and chronic productive cough. The intervention-group (n = 42) received azithromycin 250 mg 3 times a week
and the control-group (n = 42) received a placebo. Primary outcome was cough-specific health status at 12 weeks,
measured with the Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ). Secondary outcomes included generic and COPD-specific
health status and exacerbations. Changes in adverse events and microbiology were monitored.
Results: Mean age of participants was 68 ± 10 years and mean FEV1 was 1.36 ± 0.47 L. The improvement in LCQ
total score at 12 weeks was significantly greater with azithromycin (difference 1.3 ± 0.5, 95% CI 0.3;2.3, p = 0.01)
and met the minimal clinically important difference. Similar results were found for the domain scores, and
COPD-specific and generic health status questionnaires. Other secondary endpoints were non-significant. No
imbalances in adverse events were found.
Conclusions: Prophylactic azithromycin improved cough-specific health status in COPD-patients with chronic
productive cough to a clinically relevant degree.

Background
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of
the leading causes of death [1], with an estimated world￾wide prevalence of up to 10.1% [2] and it is expected to
increase over the coming decades [3]. Important and com￾mon symptoms in patients with COPD are chronic cough
and sputum production, or chronic bronchitis [4]. Add￾itionally, approximately up to 50% of patients with moder￾ate to severe COPD have bronchiectasis at least to some
degree and this is associated with a poorer prognosis [5,6].
Chronic cough and sputum production are caused by in￾flammation due to smoking or inhaled other irritants [7].
Mucus hypersecretion by itself facilitates bacterial prolifer￾ation and colonization which in turn contributes to
chronic inflammation [8,9]. Chronic obstructive bronchitis,
i.e. COPD, is associated with progressive lung function
loss, more frequent exacerbations, and hospitalisations [8].
The latter lead to a deterioration of health status [10]. Im￾proving health status is an important goal in the treatment
of COPD patients [3]. Inhaled glucocorticoids, long-acting
beta2-agonists, and long-acting anticholinergics have all
been shown to reduce exacerbation frequency in COPD,

but despite these therapies, the average frequency of acute
exacerbations still remains approximately 1.4 each year
[11]. An addition to the usual therapy is long-term macro￾lide use, of which the mechanism of action is attributed to
the immunomodulatory effects as well as to diverse actions
that suppress microbial virulence factors beyond their anti￾bacterial effects [12-14]. In several studies [15-21] macro￾lides have been demonstrated to reduce the frequency of
COPD exacerbations of which four studies [16,18,19,21]
examined disease specific and generic health status as a
secondary outcome only. None of these studies addressed
cough-specific health status specifically. We were inter￾ested in cough because it is very relevant to patients’ daily
life and chronic cough and sputum production are also risk
factors for worse outcomes in COPD patients [22]. The
impact on cough-specific health status in these patients is
largely unknown. The Leicester Cough Questionnaire
(LCQ) is a cough-specific health status questionnaire
which is originally validated for a population of general pa￾tients presenting with chronic cough [23]. Recently, the
LCQ was validated to measure cough-specific health status
in patients with COPD and chronic bronchitis [24].
Hence, the primary hypothesis was that prophylactic
azithromycin improves cough-specific health status in
patients with COPD and chronic productive cough. Im￾portant secondary hypotheses were that it also leads to
improvements in generic and COPD-specific health
status.
Methods
Study design
The study was designed as a single-centre parallel group
randomised double-blind placebo controlled trial. It was
carried out in the Isala klinieken, a large teaching hospital
in Zwolle, the Netherlands. Approval of the local ethics
committee was received (NL19886.075.07, local number:
07.0971) and the study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov
(NCT01071161). All participants provided written in￾formed consent.
Participants
Eligible patients were ≥ 40 years, had a clinical diagnosis
of COPD GOLD stage ≥2 (defined as a post bronchodila￾tor of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) <80%
and a ratio of FEV1 to forced vital capacity of <70%), and
were suffering from chronic productive cough, defined as
cough for at least the last 12 weeks, in two subsequent
years. Exclusion criteria were a prior history of asthma;
use of intravenous or oral corticosteroids and/or antibi￾otics for an exacerbation three weeks before inclusion;
other relevant lung or liver diseases at the discretion of
the treating physician; pregnancy or lactation; use of
macrolides in the last six weeks prior to inclusion; allergy
or intolerance to macrolides; or use of other investiga￾tional medication started two months prior to inclusion.
Long term treatment with aerosolized antibiotics, in￾haled corticosteroids, and/or bronchodilators was permit￾ted during the trial, provided that it was kept constant.
Randomisation and blinding
Patients were randomly assigned, without stratification,
to receive azithromycin 250 mg three times a week or an
identical appearing placebo for 12 weeks. Randomisation
codes were generated using a computer allocation pro￾gram, with a 1:1 ratio and a permutated block size of 4.
Investigators, research nurses, and participants were
masked to treatment allocation until final analyses of the
data were performed.
Procedures
Patients were instructed to take the study medication
weekly on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Study medi￾cation was prepared by Central Hospital Pharmacy, The
Hague, the Netherlands and was distributed by our hos￾pital pharmacy. During the first outpatient visit, baseline
spirometry, smoking status, pulmonary medication, and
laboratory blood values (aspartate transaminase (ASAT),
alanine aminotransferase (ALAT), and C-reactive protein
(CRP)), and a spontaneous sputum sample for culture of
respiratory pathogens were collected. Patients were asked
to complete the LCQ [23,24], SGRQ [25], and SF-36 [26],
to assess cough-specific, disease-specific (COPD), and gen￾eric health status, respectively. At two, six, nine, and eight￾een weeks, telephone calls were scheduled to collect data
on adverse events, concomitant medication, and to ask the
patient to complete the LCQ and return it by mail. At 12
weeks a second outpatient visit was planned at which spir￾ometry was done and blood laboratory values, and a spon￾taneous sputum sample were collected. Also, the LCQ,
SGRQ, and SF-36 were repeated. Adherence was assessed
by counting the unused pills. All participants were analysed
for bronchiectasis by high resolution CT-thorax at baseline.
Criteria for the diagnosis of bronchiectasis were lack of ta￾pering, visibility of bronchi within 1 cm of the pleura and
bronchial dilatation (bronchial diameter larger than that of
the accompanying pulmonary artery while avoiding slices
close to bronchial bifurcations) [6].
Endpoints
The primary endpoints were mean LCQ total and do￾main scores at 12 weeks. The LCQ total scores vary
from 3 to 21 and the domain scores vary from 1 to 7,
with a higher score signifying better health status, the
MCID is 1.3 [23,24]. The secondary endpoints at 12
weeks were: St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire
(SGRQ) total score (range from 0-100, a low score indi￾cates a good health status, the MCID is 4 [25,27]), Short

Form 36 (SF-36) score (range from 0-100, higher scores
represent better health status, the MCID is 4 [26,28,29]),
post-bronchodilator spirometry (FEV1, FEV1%predicted),
blood values, and microbiology. Other endpoints in￾cluded time to first exacerbation of COPD, defined as a
sustained worsening of the patient’s condition, from the
stable state and beyond normal day-to-day variations,
that necessitates treatment with prednisolone, antibiotics
or a combination of both [30], as well as exacerbation
and hospitalization rates for COPD, and adverse events,
during 18 weeks.
Sample size considerations
Sample size calculation was based on LCQ total scores. At
the time of designing the study no MCID estimate of the
LCQ was available. Therefore, a difference between the
study groups in mean LCQ total score of at least 1.5 (SD =
2.0) points at 12 weeks was chosen. To be able to demon￾strate this difference with a power of 90% and a two-sided
α level of 0.05, 42 patients were needed in each group (tak￾ing into account a drop-out rate of 10%).
Statistical analyses
Primary and secondary analyses were done according to
the intention-to-treat principle. Missing LCQ data at 12
weeks were imputed using the last observation carried
forward, from 9 weeks, when possible. Normal distribu￾tions of outcomes were checked using histograms. Base￾line characteristics, microbiology outcomes, and blood
values at baseline and at 12 weeks were examined with
descriptive statistics. Differences in primary and continu￾ous secondary outcomes (i.e. SGRQ scores, SF-36 scores,
and spirometry) were tested using ANCOVA, adjusting for
baseline values. Interaction terms between treatment group
and baseline value were checked to explore whether the ex￾tent of treatment response varied dependent on the value of
the baseline value. A log-rank test was used to test differ￾ences in time to first exacerbation between study groups
which were graphically presented by Kaplan-Meier curves.
Between-group comparisons of proportions were performed
using Chi-squared tests. P-values <0.05 were considered sig￾nificant. Analyses were performed using SPSS-Statistics ver￾sion 19.0 (IBM corporation, Armonk, NY, USA).

are shown in a consort flow chart, Figure 1. Baseline
characteristics were similar between the groups, except
for a small difference in proportion of patients using in￾haled corticosteroids and the LCQ total score, Table 1.
Adherence with study medication was high during the
study. On average, 85% and 92% of the patients used all
weekly dosages in the azithromycin and placebo groups,
respectively (p = 0.48 for difference).
Primary outcome
A significantly greater mean increase in LCQ total score
after 12 weeks was found in the azithromycin group com￾pared with placebo, 1.3 ± 0.5 (95% CI 0.3; 2.3, p = 0.01).
Significant differences were also found for the different
domain scores of the LCQ, Table 2.
Repeated measurements analysis over the full treatment
period also showed that the mean differences between
groups for the LCQ total score were significant (p = 0.01),
in favour of the azithromycin group (Figure 2). According
to the study protocol prophylactic azithromycin was
stopped at 12 weeks which resulted in a decrease of the
LCQ total score in the azithromycin group, whereas in the
control group this decrease already started at 9 weeks.
As described in the methods, the interaction term be￾tween study group and baseline value was checked in
the ANCOVA analysis. In all models including LCQ
total and domain scores, significant interaction was
present. In other words, treatment responses varied
dependent on the value of the baseline LCQ total score.
To investigate the impact of interaction the study popu￾lation was divided according to the median of baseline
LCQ total score which was 14.1, since no meaningful
cut-off values have so far been proposed in literature.
The improvement with azithromycin compared to pla￾cebo in total LCQ score in the complete population
proved to be due almost entirely to the patients with a
low LCQ total score (<14.1). The difference over 12
weeks for the azithromycin group with a low LCQ total

score at baseline was 2.6 ± 0.8 (95% CI 1.0;4.2, p = 0.002)
and for the azithromycin group with a high LCQ total
score at baseline (≥ 14.1) was 0.1 ± 0.6 (95% CI -1.1;1.2,
p = 0.90).
Secondary outcomes
SGRQ and SF-36
The improvement in SGRQ total score over 12 weeks
was greater with azithromycin than with placebo: mean
difference was -7.4 ± 2.5 (95% CI -12.5; -2.5 p = 0.004).
The improvements in the SGRQ domain scores symp￾toms and impact were also significant, Table 3. Similar
to the primary outcome the improvements in SGRQ
scores also proved to be due almost entirely to the pa￾tients with a low LCQ total baseline score (<14.1). The dif￾ference of the SGRQ total score after 12 weeks in patients
with a low LCQ total baseline score was -13.8 ± 4.1 (95%
CI -22;-5.5 p = 0.002) in favour of the azithromycin group.
On the contrary, the difference of the SGRQ total score
for patients with a high LCQ baseline score was -1.6 ± 2.9
(95% CI -7.5;4.4 p = 0.59). Significant mean differences at
12 weeks in favour of the azithromycin group were found
in the SF-36 scores: general health, role physical, social
functioning, and mental health, see Table 3. Comparable
with the primary and the SGRQ findings, patients with a
low LCQ baseline score showed a greater difference after
12 weeks in the SF-36 domain general health (14.1 ± 5.0
(95% CI 4.0;24.3 p = 0.01)) in favour of the azithromycin
group than patients with a high LCQ baseline score (2.4 ±
4.2 (95% CI -6.2;11.0 p = 0.57)). Analysis of the other SF￾36 domain scores follows the same tendency, except for
role physical.
Exacerbations
A COPD exacerbation occurred in 10 (23.8%) patients in
the azithromycin group and 17 (40.5%) in the placebo
group, p = 0.10.
Because less than 25% of the patients in the azithro￾mycin group had an exacerbation in 18 weeks the 20th
percentile time to the first exacerbation was calculated,
which was 105 ± 30 days in participants receiving azi￾thromycin compared with 66 ± 21 days in the placebo
group (p = 0.13; log-rank test), Figure 3.

Four (9.5%) patients in the azithromycin group and 5
(11.9%) patients in the placebo group were hospitalized
for COPD.
Analogous to the other outcomes there was a trend to￾wards a lower exacerbation frequency in the patients with a
low LCQ baseline total score which received azithromycin.
Spirometry, blood, sputum and adverse events
There were neither statistically significant nor clinically
relevant differences in FEV1.
ASAT and ALAT were similar in both groups at base￾line with no relevant changes in either group after 12
weeks. Furthermore, no individual changes above nor￾mal values in ASAT and ALAT were found.
A reduction of respiratory pathogens was seen in the
azithromycin group after 12 weeks, Table 4.
Adverse events were comparable in both groups
(Table 5). In the azithromycin group three patients with
adverse events stopped using study medication, two pa￾tients had diarrhoea, and one patient had disturbance of
taste. In the placebo group one patient stopped study
medication because of disturbance of taste.
Discussion
Our study is the first randomised placebo controlled trial
to evaluate the effect of prophylactic azithromycin on
cough-specific health status (LCQ) in COPD patients
with chronic bronchitis. Cough-specific health status, as
well as disease specific (SGRQ), and generic (SF-36)
health status improved statistically significantly with azi￾thromycin compared to placebo, with improvements
equal to or exceeding the MCID. Moreover, there was a
clear trend for azithromycin to increase the time to the
first exacerbation compared to placebo. Adverse events
were similar in both groups, which indicated azithromy￾cin was well tolerated.
The beneficial effect of azithromycin was apparent for
the study population as a group, but patients with a high
baseline LCQ total score experienced no effects of azi￾thromycin on cough-specific health status and the other
efficacy outcomes at all. Although all patients recruited
for this study met the predefined definition of chronic
productive cough, it appears that the LCQ could dis￾criminate between patients who respond to azithromycin
and those who did not. Perhaps, COPD patients with
chronic cough are more heterogeneous than expected,
depending on the degree of impairment of cough￾specific health status, the LCQ might discriminate
between different types or severity of cough in COPD pa￾tients. It has been shown before that chronic cough with
persistent symptoms has a larger impact on activities of
daily life than morning cough or incidental cough [31].
Recent studies [15-21] assessing the effect of prophylactic
antibiotics in patients with COPD and chronic bronchitis
focused particularly on reducing exacerbations. Six of these
studies used macrolides i.e. erythromycin, clarithromycin,
and azithromycin respectively. These antibiotics belong to
the same category, US FDA approved, and can thus be
compared [32]. Four studies explored health status as a sec￾ondary outcome [16,18,19,21], of which one study did not
include concurrent controls [18]. In these studies the dis￾ease specific and generic health status were measured as a

secondary outcome only and findings were inconsistent.
None of these studies addressed cough-specific health sta￾tus specifically.
In one large clinical trial [16] the dose of azithromycin
was 250 mg a day for one year, resulting in development
of nasopharyngeal colonization with azithromycin￾resistant pathogens, 81% versus 41% for the azithromy￾cin group and the placebo group respectively. It has
been suggested that the daily dose might be more than
needed, especially given these resistance problems. In
our study, with azithromycin 250 mg three times per
week, only one patient developed an azithromycin￾resistant Haemophilus Influenzae, although the follow
up period was only three months. Our lower dose of azi￾thromycin of 250 mg of three times a week seemed
equally effective and sufficient.
Another important question is the optimal duration of
treatment. In our study we chose to treat patients for 3
months. In 2 recent studies [16,33] patients were treated
with prophylactic azithromycin for 6 months and for 1
year respectively. It is interesting to note that in both
studies the largest effect was seen in the first 3 to 4
months, afterwards a more equal exacerbation rate was
noticeable for both the azithromycin and the control
group. Perhaps, an alternate treatment scheme of
prophylactic azithromycin, e.g. every other 3 months, is
preferable over continuous use, and thus preventing un￾necessary treatment with long-term antibiotics, which
has important consequences with respect to side effects,
and bacterial resistance.
One obvious limitation of our study was the small
group, though the study was sufficiently powered for the
primary outcome, LCQ scores at 12 weeks. However, the
primary outcome was missing in ten patients; in five cases
data from nine weeks could be imputed which probably
underestimated treatment response at 12 weeks. We
chose to impute data with the last observation carried for￾ward approach to increase power and precision, though
there also limitations to this approach [34,35]. Another
limitation is the MCID of the LCQ is not yet established
in COPD patients with chronic cough; therefore the
MCID in patients with chronic cough was used in this
study. It will be clinically useful to determine a MCID of
the LCQ specifically in COPD patients with chronic
cough. Finally, since objective cough frequency does not
always correlate with symptoms or cough-specific health
status, the use of cough recorders at home to objectively
assess cough would have been an interesting but costly ad￾junct to the study [36].
Conclusions
In conclusion, this study showed that prophylactic azi￾thromycin of 250 mg, three times a week for three
months, provided significant and clinically relevant
improvements in cough specific health status in patients
with COPD and chronic productive cough. This was
supported by improvements in disease specific and gen￾eric health status parameters, and although not powered
to assess a reduction in exacerbation rate, the tendency
was nevertheless clear. The effects were largely limited
to those with a high burden of cough specific complaints
at baseline. Interesting next steps would be studies lim￾ited to patients with a high LCQ, perhaps assessing also
the level of airway inflammation. We believe it is an in￾teresting thought to further elaborate on duration of
macrolides treatment and whether it should be continu￾ous or recurrent.
