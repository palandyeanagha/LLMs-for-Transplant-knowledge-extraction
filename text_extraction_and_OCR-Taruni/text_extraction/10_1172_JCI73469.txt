The pathogenesis of mucoinfective lung disease in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients likely involves poor mucus 
clearance. A recent model of mucus clearance predicts that mucus flow depends on the relative mucin concen￾tration of the mucus layer compared with that of the periciliary layer; however, mucin concentrations have 
been difficult to measure in CF secretions. Here, we have shown that the concentration of mucin in CF sputum 
is low when measured by immunologically based techniques, and mass spectrometric analyses of CF mucins 
revealed mucin cleavage at antibody recognition sites. Using physical size exclusion chromatography/differ￾ential refractometry (SEC/dRI) techniques, we determined that mucin concentrations in CF secretions were 
higher than those in normal secretions. Measurements of partial osmotic pressures revealed that the partial 
osmotic pressure of CF sputum and the retained mucus in excised CF lungs were substantially greater than 
the partial osmotic pressure of normal secretions. Our data reveal that mucin concentration cannot be accu￾rately measured immunologically in proteolytically active CF secretions; mucins are hyperconcentrated in CF 
secretions; and CF secretion osmotic pressures predict mucus layer–dependent osmotic compression of the 
periciliary liquid layer in CF lungs. Consequently, mucin hypersecretion likely produces mucus stasis, which 
contributes to key infectious and inflammatory components of CF lung disease.
Introduction
Despite an in-depth understanding of the genetic and molecular 
basis of cystic fibrosis (CF), the pathogenesis of CF mucoinfective 
lung disease remains unclear (1). The mechanical clearance of bac￾teria from the lungs is mediated by cilia- and cough-dependent 
clearance of mucus (2, 3), and there are data suggesting that 
defects in mucus clearance occur early in CF pathogenesis (4, 5). 
Additionally, there are reports of an impairment of antimicrobial 
killing in the surface liquid of CF airways that is potentially pH 
dependent (6, 7). However, based on the likelihood that bacterial 
selection will quickly generate organisms resistant to airway sur￾face liquid (ASL) killing mechanisms, it is probable that mechani￾cal clearance of bacteria is central to lung defense (8).
The mucus that constitutes the mobile mucus layer covering 
human airways is a complex mixture of mucins, globular pro￾teins, antimicrobial proteins and peptides, salts, and water. The 
gel-forming mucins MUC5B and MUC5AC, however, are the 
major macromolecular contributors to the non-Newtonian prop￾erties of mucus responsible for transport of this layer (2, 9–11). 
Secreted gel-forming mucins are large, polymeric, glycosylated 
proteins, with molecular weights ranging from approximately 2 to 
50 MDa, and up to 80% of their mass is carbohydrate. Of the 
secreted mucins, MUC5AC and MUC5B are the dominant secreted 
mucins in both normal and diseased human airways (12, 13). 
Recent data have suggested that the transportability of the mucus 
layer is heavily dependent on the concentration of mucins in the 
mucus layer, which in overlap (semi-dilute) conditions theoretically 
generates partial (i.e., mucin-dominated) osmotic pressures that 
are a function of the mucin concentration to the power of 2.5 (2). 
In CF, an increase in mucin concentration and partial osmotic 
pressure would be predicted to result from a decrease in airway 
surface liquid volume and/or an increase in mucin secretion, slow￾ing mucus clearance and producing mucostasis (14).
However, few studies have measured MUC5AC and MUC5B 
mucin concentrations in normal or CF airway secretions (10, 15–17). 
In one recent report, Henke et al. suggested that there may be 
no difference, or a dramatic decrease rather than increase, in the 
concentrations of the secreted mucins MUC5AC and MUC5B in 
CF mucus depending on Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) 
infection status (10, 16–18). Importantly, Henke et al. used solely 
antibody-dependent analyses of agarose gel Western blots as the 
basis for mucin quantitation in their studies. Thus, the reports of 
Henke et al. suggest that CF mucus is dominated by macromole￾cules other than mucins, e.g., DNA, that determine its biophysical 
properties and modulate its transport (17, 19).
In the present study, we sought to measure mucin concentra￾tions in normal and CF pulmonary secretions using a combina￾tion of techniques. Based on previous reports of mucin proteolysis

in airway secretions (10, 18, 20) and our own preliminary data, 
we first investigated the hypothesis that immunologically based 
quantitation methods are inaccurate for mucin quantitation in 
CF airway secretions due to proteolytic degradation of exposed 
epitopes within mucin molecules (18). Second, we compared phys￾ical versus immunologic methods for mucin quantitation using a 
combination of size exclusion chromatography coupled to differ￾ential refractive index measurement (SEC/dRI) techniques to mea￾sure mucin concentrations in samples from normal and CF sub￾jects and from cell cultures. Third, we asked whether an increase 
in mucin concentration in CF secretions may, in part, reflect an 
increase in airway epithelial mucin gene transcription and/or 
mucin secretory cell numbers. Finally, because the partial osmotic 
pressure of mucus may be predictive of mucus flow versus no flow, 
a novel technique for measuring the partial osmotic pressure of 
mucus was developed and applied to normal and CF samples (2).
Results
Immunologic measurements of mucins in CF versus normal 
secretions and analyses of mucin epitope integrity
Measurements of MUC5B in CF versus normal sputum. To quantitate 
MUC5B mucin concentrations in samples similar to those of 
Henke et al. (17), sputum samples were obtained from CF and 
normal subjects, solubilized in GuHCl, and analyzed via agarose 
gel electrophoresis under both whole (unreduced) and reduced 
conditions. As seen in Figure 1, whole CF sputum exhibited an 
approximately 40% reduction in MUC5B antibody immunoreac￾tivity compared with that in whole normal sputum. There was a 
further substantial decrease in the MUC5B antibody immunoreac￾tivity in all CF samples when these samples were reduced.
Measurements of mucins and lactoferrin in pediatric BAL. We also 
performed immunologic quantitation of mucins was in pediatric 
BAL. We hypothesized that all macromolecules secreted by airway 
epithelia and/or glands would be concentrated in CF mucus secre￾tions harvested by BAL from pediatric patients. Accordingly, we 
analyzed BAL samples from non-CF disease control and CF sub￾jects for lactoferrin, an index of gland antimicrobial protein secre￾tion, and used immunologic techniques to analyze the secreted 
gel-forming airway mucins MUC5AC and MUC5B (Figure 2). As 
predicted, lactoferrin concentrations were increased in CF BAL 
samples as compared with those found in disease control sam￾ples (Figure 2A). In the non-CF disease controls, MUC5B was the 
dominant secreted mucin (Figure 2B). Like Henke et al. (17) and 
as shown in Figure 1, MUC5B levels appeared to be reduced in CF 
samples compared with normal samples when mucin quantitation 
was determined by immunodetection. We found that MUC5AC 
levels were not significantly lower in the CF samples.
Protease effects on mucin concentrations and macromolecular 
mass measured by immunologic techniques in CF versus normal 
airway secretions
Assessment of the effect of trypsin and human neutrophil elastase on mucin 
immunoreactivity. CF sputum typically exhibits substantial quan￾tities of free neutrophil elastase (NE) (21). To elucidate the effect 
of proteases including elastase on immunodetection of mucin, 
purified mucins were subjected to controlled proteolysis in vitro 
over a 5- to 240-minute time course. We measured the proteolytic 
effects on mucin antibody reactivity with 2 different antibodies. 
Probing with a polyclonal MUC5B antibody (MAN5BIII) revealed 
that trypsin treatment substantially reduced the antibody reac￾tivity over the 240-minute incubation (Figure 3A). In compari￾Figure 1

son, incubation with NEs at concentrations mimicking those in 
CF sputum (1 μg/ml) (22) virtually abolished antibody reactivity 
within 5 minutes (Figure 3A). Studies of immunoreactivity using a 
monoclonal MUC5B antibody (EU-MUC5Ba) indicated that both 
elastase and trypsin abolished mucin detection after 20 minutes 
of exposure (Figure 3A).
Assessment of human NE on mucin molecular mass and integrity. Mul￾tiangle light scattering coupled to size exclusion chromatography 
(SEC/MALS) measurements to determine the macromolecular 
integrity of purified salivary MUC5B indicated that after 60 min￾utes of elastase exposure, at least 80% to 90% of the mucins main￾tained a molecular weight of approximately 38 MDa (Figure 3B), 
i.e., that typical of purified MUC5B (23, 24). A typical dRI trace 
(solid lines) and the molecular mass distribution (dotted lines) 
in the void (Vo) volume region are shown in Figure 3B. The total 
mucin mass in the Vo volume was monitored by dRI and was 
slightly decreased from 28.4 μg (± 1.2 μg) (blue line, PBS control) 
to 25.6 μg (± 0.9 μg) after a 20-minute elastase incubation (green 
line) and to 24.2 μg (± 0.8 μg) after a 60-minute elastase incuba￾tion (magenta line). Corresponding molecular mass calculations 
showed that control mucins exhibited an average molecular 
mass of approximately 38 MDa (± 6.2%) (blue dotted line), which 
slightly increased to approximately 44 MDa (± 4.2%) after 20 min￾utes (green dotted line) and 60 minutes (magenta dotted line) of 
elastase incubation. These findings suggest that relatively short (up 
to 60-minute) incubation periods of NE with these samples did not 
affect the macromolecular integrity of the MUC5B macromolecule, 
despite dramatically affecting the antibody reactivity.
In parallel experiments, whole HBE mucus (2.5%) 
was incubated with human NE and PBS. We per￾formed cone and plate rheometry measurements 
and detected no differences in viscosity profiles 
for elastase versus PBS incubation over the same 
60-minute time period (Supplemental Figure 2; 
supplemental material available online with this arti￾cle; doi:10.1172/JCI73469DS1). These data also sug￾gest that elastase did not affect the macromolecular 
properties of mucus responsible for key biophysical 
parameters, i.e., viscosity.
P. aeruginosa affects MUC5B antibody detection. Because 
P. aeruginosa has been reported to cause proteolytic deg￾radation of mucins (16, 25), we next tested whether its 
presence is also a contributor to the proteolytic deg￾radation of mucins in CF sputum samples. We tested 
antibody reactivity by comparing the biochemical and 
immunologic features of mucins in sterile human 
bronchial epithelial (HBE) mucus in sputum from a 
P. aeruginosa–infected CF patient and in sterile mucus 
of varying concentrations generated from HBE cultures 
with or without exposure to P. aeruginosa. Two different 
concentrations of HBE mucus (2.5% approximating 
normal; 8% approximating CF) were incubated for 
72 hours with a laboratory strain of P. aeruginosa (PAO1) 
or a mutant form of P. aeruginosa (PAO-JP1) (26), which 
lacks the lasI quorum-sensing gene that controls 
P. aeruginosa elastase gene expression and therefore 
expresses minimal elastase activity (27). After initial 
seeding, we observed by microscopy that the bacteria 
were growing as biofilms in 8% mucus, but not in 2.5% 
mucus, within 24 to 48 hours (not shown). Following 
the 72-hour culture interval, we investigated the immunologically 
detected integrity of the mucins in the HBE cell culture samples 
and CF sputum samples using agarose gel electrophoresis and 
immunoblotting (Figure 4). The top panel (Figure 4A) represents 
whole samples (no reduction prior to loading the agarose gel); 
the bottom panel (Figure 4B) represents the samples that were 
reduced with DTT prior to loading into the agarose gel.
Analyses of the whole (unreduced) samples demonstrated that 
the P. aeruginosa–infected CF sputum (Figure 4A, lane 1) migrated 
into the gel faster than did the sterile (non–P. aeruginosa–contain￾ing) HBE culture mucus (Figure 4A, lane 2). The PAO-JPI HBE cul￾ture (mutant P. aeruginosa with minimal elastase; Figure 4A, lane 3) 
exhibited a profile similar to that of the sterile mucus (Figure 4A, 
lane 2). In contrast, we found that the addition of PAO1 to 8% 
mucus, which produced biofilms and elastase, was associated with 
the absence of detectable MUC5B (Figure 4A, lane 4). Exposure of 
PAO1 to 2.5% mucus, which did not support biofilm formation, 
was associated with decreased proteolysis compared with exposure 
of PAO1 to 8% mucus (Figure 4A, lane 5). Reduction accentuated 
the effects of proteolysis on the immunodetection of MUC5B, 
with only mutant P. aeruginosa (with minimal elastase) and nor￾mal HBE samples exhibiting detectable MUC5B after reduction 
(Figure 4B, lanes 2 and 3). As expected with reduction, these 
2 lanes exhibited further migration into the gel after reduction. 
Even though the cell culture with PAO1 in 2.5% mucus did not 
form biofilms and hence maintained immunodetection before 
reduction, the presence of P. aeruginosa was sufficient to result in 
loss of immunodetection after reduction.

mucin. MUC5B levels were reduced in CF versus normal samples when mucin 
quantitation was determined by immunodetection. MUC5AC levels were not signifi￾cantly lower in CF samples. Data represent the mean ± SEM (*P < 0.01).

Mass spectrometry demonstrates proteolytic cleavage of MUC5B in native 
CF sputum and HBE cell culture samples containing P. aeruginosa. Anal￾ysis of the tryptic peptides from both normal sputum and HBE 
mucus indicated that the secreted mucins MUC5B and MUC5AC 
were the major molecules in the density gradient CL-2B void frac￾tions with few other globular proteins detected (data not shown).
The tryptic peptide coverage we obtained for MUC5B isolated 
from normal induced sputum samples was extensive (~20%) and 
widely dispersed throughout the molecule (Figure 5). Analyses of 
MUC5B isolated from normal saliva revealed a similar comprehen￾sive coverage (not shown). However, our analysis of the MUC5B 
mucin isolated from CF sputum revealed a much more restricted 
coverage (~8%) of the molecule, with notable loss of coverage in the C 
terminus, Cys-rich regions, and especially in the N termini (Figure 5).
We next tested whether the presence of P. aeruginosa could repro￾duce this cleavage pattern of mucin molecules by comparing non￾treated (sterile) with P. aeruginosa–treated 8% HBE mucus samples. 
The coverage of MUC5B isolated from the sterile mucus was com￾plete and similar to that of normal sputum (20%). In contrast, 
coverage of P. aeruginosa–treated CF-like mucus was also heavily 
restricted (8%), and the pattern of loss of coverage was similar to 
that observed in CF sputum (Figure 5).
Separation and identification of the oligomeric state of gel-forming 
mucins in CF versus normal sputum by CL-2B chromatography
The oligomeric integrity of the mucin molecules in normal 
and CF samples was next characterized by CL-2B gel filtration 
chromatography and immunoblotting (Figure 6). In the normal 
samples, the whole (unreduced) MUC5AC and 5B molecules ran 
in the exclusion limit, i.e., Vo fractions, of the CL-2B chroma￾tographic column, as expected for airway mucins (ref. 28 and 
Figure 6, A and B). In contrast, reduced samples exhibited more 
included volume (Vinc) distributions for MUC5AC and MUC5B 
proteins in the column, as predicted for structures of lower 
molecular weight (Figure 6, A and B).
The analyses of whole (unreduced) CF samples revealed a rel￾atively intact molecular size for MUC5AC. There was some evi￾dence for increased penetration into the included volume for 
MUC5B, but the pattern was generally similar to that of MUC5B 
obtained from normal sputum (Figure 6, C and D). In contrast, 
our analysis of reduced CF mucus samples demonstrated 2 fea￾tures that were strikingly different from those of the normal 
samples. First, reduction completely abolished antibody reactiv￾ity to MUC5AC (Figure 6C). Second, the size of immunoreactive 
MUC5B molecules after reduction was significantly smaller than 
that of the normal samples (Figure 6, B and D). For example, we 
observed no immunoreactivity of CF MUC5B between fractions 
10–20 (Figure 6D), in which monomers were found in the nor￾mal samples (Figure 6B). These findings suggest that reduction 
revealed proteolytic cleavages of protein monomers in CF sam￾ples. Importantly, the integrity of mucin oligomers in CF sputum 
in the whole (i.e., unreduced) state suggests that disulfide bonds 
preserve the oligomeric forms of mucins and maintain key bio￾physical properties of mucins (Figure 6, C and D).

The effect of proteases on mucin epitopes and polymeric structure. (A) Isolated MUC5B (100 μg) was incubated with either trypsin (1 μg) or 
elastase (1 μg) for increasing periods of time (5 minutes to 4 hours). Unreduced aliquots of the samples were subjected to agarose gel electro￾phoresis and probed with MAN5BIII or EU-MUC5Ba antibodies. MAN5BIII immunoreactivity was completely abolished by the NE within 5 minutes, 
while trypsin treatment substantially reduced the antibody reactivity. EU-MUC5Ba immunoreactivity was lost within 20 minutes of exposure to 
both trypsin and elastase. (B) An aliquot from the NE-treated samples was subjected to SEC/MALS/dRI measurements using a Sepharose CL-2B 
(2 × 5 ml) column to determine molecular weight (dotted lines) and sample concentrations (solid lines), respectively. The total mucin mass under 
the curve was slightly decreased from 28.4 μg (blue line, PBS control) to 25.6 μg after a 20-minute elastase incubation (green line) and to 24.2 μg 
after a 60-minute elastase incubation (magenta line). Molecular mass measurements were plotted across the mucin peak: control mucins had 
an average molecular mass of approximately 38 MDa (blue dotted line) and had an average molecular mass of approximately 44 MDa after 
20 (green dotted line) and 60 (magenta dotted line) minutes of elastase incubation, indicating a slight increase in molecular weight.

Measuring gel-forming mucin gene expression in normal and CF 
lung tissues
To test whether there was increased mucin synthesis by CF air￾way epithelia, total mRNA was extracted from normal (n = 14) 
and CF (n = 10) bronchi ex vivo, and mucin gene expression was 
measured via real-time PCR. Since small changes in Ct (threshold 
or inflection cycle, also called cross-point) lead to marked differ￾ences in fold changes, results are shown as the relative changes 
in cross-point (Ct) values for MUC5AC and MUC5B mRNA lev￾els. We found that both MUC5AC and MUC5B mRNA levels were 
increased in CF lungs as compared with the levels in non-CF 
lungs (Figure 7). Fold-change calculations by the 2–averageΔΔCt for￾mula revealed a 4.5- and a 2.6-fold increase in CF for MUC5AC and 
MUC5B gene expression, respectively. For this experiment, prim￾ers for MUC5AC and MUC5B were designed to exhibit compara￾ble efficiency (~2). On average, MUC5AC cross-point values were 
lower than those for MUC5B, indicating that MUC5AC was the 
dominant mucin expressed in airway cell surfaces. Note that all 
“normal,” non-CF lungs were subjected to mechanical ventilation 
for 1 to 3 days prior to dissection, which is known to stimulate 
mucin gene expression as well as absolute values in MUC5AC and 
MUC5B and their ratios (15). Hence, this intervention may have 
led to an underestimation of CF fold changes in this data set.
Immunohistochemical detection of intracellular mucins in normal 
and CF airways
Airway secretions stained with Alcian Blue-PAS (AB-PAS) revealed 
evidence for goblet cell hyperplasia in CF bronchi and bronchioles 
compared with that observed in normal airway epithelia (Figure 8A), 
as previously reported (15). In addition, intense AB-PAS staining 
was detected in the lumens of CF bronchi and bronchioles, but 
not in normal airways. MUC5AC and MUC5B immunostaining 
of CF airways confirmed the increase in airway epithelial goblet 
cells in CF airways (Figure 8B). The acellular material in the lumen 
stained less intensely than did the intracellular materials in the 
airway epithelial cells, consistent with proteolytic cleavage. In nor￾mal conducting airways, MUC5AC is mostly expressed in surface 
epithelium, while MUC5B is expressed in submucosal glands (29).
Direct comparison of immunologic versus biophysical measurements 
of newly secreted mucins added to CF airway supernatant 
mucopurulent material
To determine whether the apparent loss of immunoreactivity 
observed for mucins sampled from CF sputum could be repro￾duced in vitro, we treated HBE cultures for 72 hours with CF 
supernatant mucopurulent material (SMM) to replicate the 
mucin hypersecretory environment of CF (30) and then sequen￾tially exposed the cultures to ATPγS (100 μM, 60 minutes), fol￾lowed by exposure to fractionated SMM on PBS for 2 hours 
(see Methods). We analyzed MUC5B in the secretions harvested 
from the cultures by agarose Western blotting (Figure 9A) or SEC/
dRI (Figure 9B). The apparent mucin concentration in the frac￾tionated SMM–exposed samples measured by immunologic tech￾niques was significantly decreased in comparison with that in the 
PBS samples (Figure 9A). However, analyses by SEC/dRI revealed 
that total mucin secreted in response to ATPγS stimulus was sim￾ilar in samples exposed to filtered SMM and PBS (6 ± 2 mg/ml). 
The observation that total mucin concentrations, as measured by 
immunologic techniques, decreased when fractionated SMM was 
added to ATPγS-treated cultures, rather than not being changed 
as measured by physical techniques, strongly argues that the 
proteolytic activities in fractionated SMM prevented accurate 
measurements of mucin concentrations. Thus, a direct compar￾ison of immunologic versus physical techniques in a controlled 
environment indicated that immunologic measurements were 
not accurate in CF-like environments.
Mucin concentration in CF versus normal sputum as measured by a 
physical (refractometry) approach
Based on the data shown in Figure 9 that biophysical measure￾ments are required to accurately measure mucin concentrations in 
infected sputum, sputum samples from 10 CF individuals (spon￾taneously produced) and 8 normal subjects (via induction) were 
collected, solubilized in 6 M GuHCl, diluted in PBS with DNase

reactivity in P. aeruginosa–exposed samples. P. aeruginosa-JP1 sam￾ples (lanes 3 in A and B) maintained some antibody reactivity, as this 
P. aeruginosa mutant exhibited much lower elastase production, sug￾gesting that the P. aeruginosa proteolysis caused the absence of anti￾body staining in these gels. Origins of the loaded samples are indicated 
by the dashed lines. Gels shown are representative of at least 3 inde￾pendent experiments. PsA, P. aeruginosa.

Peptide coverage comparison of MUC5B isolated from normal and CF sputum and HBE secretions with and without P. aeruginosa. Mucins were 
isolated from normal and CF sputum and PaO-treated and nontreated HBE cell culture mucus samples using density gradient centrifugation. 
Mucins were then digested with trypsin, and peptides were identified by LC-MS/MS analysis. The coverage map indicates that most of the pep￾tides from the N terminus region, including vWF domains, were not readily detectable in CF sputum and PaO-treated HBE mucus, suggesting that 
the integrity of these regions was affected by the proteolytic activity. Mucin domains are shown as (von Willebrand) D1, D2, D3, D4, C domains, 
cystein-rich (Cys), and O-glycosylated tandem repeat mucin domains (MD). Dotted arrows illustrate repeating positions of the epitope (RNRE￾QVGKFKMC) for one of the MUC5B antibodies used (and the antibody used in the study by Henke et al.; ref. 17). The solid arrow illustrates the 
positions of the epitope (CSWYNGHRPEPGLG) for the other MUC5B antibody used. See Table 1 for antibody details.

as described in Methods, and subjected to Sepharose 2B column 
refractometry–based (SEC/dRI-based) total mucin quantita￾tion analyses (Figure 10A). The total mucin contents of the nor￾mal sputum samples were distributed between 1,014 μg/ml and 
4,755 μg/ml (average: 2,710 μg/ml). The mucin concentrations of 
sputum from CF samples ranged between 3,484 and 8,902 μg/ml, 
with 6,454 μg/ml being the average total mucin concentration. 
The differences in the values among the 2 groups were statisti￾cally significant (P = 0.001). Analyses of the efficacy of DNase 
treatment revealed that virtually 100% of DNA was removed from 
the measured sample (see Supplemental Figure 1). Thus, 
these data suggest that mucin concentrations in whole CF 
secretions were higher than normal.
Measurements of mucus partial osmotic pressure
Sputum samples and mucus obtained directly from CF 
lungs at transplantation were subjected to combined mea￾surements of mucus concentration (percentage of solids, 
hereafter referred to as % solids), performed gravimetri￾cally, and of partial osmotic pressures. We found that nor￾mal sputum exhibited % solids values of 1.15 ± 0.29 SD 
and partial osmotic pressures of 75 ± 24 Pa SD, both within ranges 
predicted for normal subjects (ref. 2 and Figure 10B). For refer￾ence, the predicted osmotic pressure of the periciliary liquid layer 
(PCL) is noted by the dashed line at approximately 500 Pa (2). 
In contrast, the CF sputum % solids values were 5.61 ± 1.92 SD, 
approximately 5-fold higher than normal, and the partial osmotic 
pressures averaged 541 Pa ± 206 Pa SD. Importantly, the mean par￾tial osmotic pressure increased by approximately 7-fold compared 
with normal pressure. Finally, mucus retained in the CF lung 
exhibited % solids values of 12.12 ± 1.97 SD and partial osmotic

pressures of 2,152 Pa ± 1,118.1 Pa SD, higher than those found 
in either CF or normal sputum. Overall, there was a good agree￾ment (correlation coefficient = 0.928) between sample % solids 
concentration and mucus partial osmotic pressure over the whole 
range of samples studied.
To allow comparisons of the relationships between % solids and 
partial osmotic pressures and mucin concentrations, we measured 
both % solids values and mucin concentrations by SEC/dRI in nor￾mal and CF sputum samples. As shown in Supplemental Figure 3, 
we observed a linear relationship (R2 = 0.9855) between % solids 
values of mucus and mucin concentrations.
Discussion
It is critical that mucus be continually cleared from airway surfaces 
for host defense of the lung. The transportability of mucus is highly 
dependent on the non-Newtonian biophysical properties of mucus 
that are governed by the concentration of mucins in the mucus layer (2). 
As mucin concentrations increase, changes in the viscoelastic prop￾erties of the layer emerge, slowing mucus clearance (9). However, the 
probable key step in the pathogenesis of airway diseases is mucus 
stasis and mucus adherence to airway surfaces (31, 32). Recent evi￾dence suggests that a biophysical parameter that predicts stasis is the 
partial osmotic pressure of the mucus layer (2). As with viscoelastic 
properties, the partial osmotic pressure of the mucus layer is a func￾tion of the mucin concentration. Therefore, in evaluating the role of 
abnormal mucus transport in the pathogenesis of CF lung disease, 
knowledge of the absolute mucin concentration and partial osmotic 
pressures of CF and normal airway secretions is required.
Historically, there have been technical difficulties in measur￾ing mucin concentrations even in normal biologic fluids, in large 
part reflecting the enormous size of mucin macromolecules and 
the fact that the protein backbone is heavily shielded by O-linked 
sugars. As shown in Figure 5, mucins have “naked” terminal pro￾tein regions that are important for dimerization, higher-order 
multimerization, and protein-protein interactions. Typically, it is 
these exposed regions in the N and C termini and the Cys region 
of MUC5AC and MUC5B against which antibodies have been 
generated for immunologic quantitation of mucins. A problem 
is that these regions are also the regions exposed to endogenous 
(17, 33) and exogenous (25) proteolytic activities, which have been 
reported to cleave these regions of mucin macromolecules (18, 25). 
Thus, these considerations suggest that there may be major techni￾cal difficulties measuring mucin concentrations by immunologic 
techniques in biologic solutions containing active proteases.
Like Henke et al. (17), our immunologically based quantitative 
analyses of mucins revealed decreased levels of whole and reduced 
MUC5B in adult P. aeruginosa–infected CF sputum compared with 
levels in normal sputum (Figure 1). Our data from BAL samples 
from pediatric control versus pediatric CF patients revealed the 
predicted increase in concentrations of the globular protein lacto￾ferrin in CF but, like Henke et al. reported, decreased concentra￾tions of MUC5B (Figure 2). Because of the reported presence of 
NE in CF airway secretions early in life (34), we directly tested the 
hypothesis that human NE (HNE) could proteolytically attack the 
“naked” protein regions of MUC5AC and 5B, the regions against 
which our antibodies were directed. As shown in Figure 3, we 
observed time-dependent decreases in immunoreactive MUC5B 
following exposure to HNE or trypsin. Importantly, there was rel￾atively little change in the molecular mass of mucins following this 
exposure. These findings raised the possibility that elastase cleav￾ages affect sites in mucin monomers not critical for oligomeric 
(macromolecular) behavior (see below).
We also investigated the possibility that bacterial proteases con￾tribute to proteolysis of antigenically exposed sites of MUC5B. 
These studies revealed that P. aeruginosa, growing in thick mucus 
with a biofilm physiology, produced an elastase-like activity that 
cleaved mucin macromolecules and reduced their immunologi￾cally measured concentrations (Figure 4). PAK bacteria genetically 
deficient in the capacity to produce biofilms and secrete elastase 
did not exhibit this activity. In contrast to the data for sputum￾or saliva-exposed HNE, P. aeruginosa–secreted proteases produced 
a greater reduction in mucin molecular mass, suggesting that 
P. aeruginosa proteases may not be the dominant mucin-cleaving 
proteases in vivo (compare Figure 4 with Figure 1).
The mass spectrometric analyses comparing the mucins in CF 
versus normal sputum revealed key data that accounted for this 
apparent reduction in mucin concentrations in CF sputum as 
measured immunologically. The mass spectrometric studies pro￾duced evidence for mucin proteolysis centered on the “naked” 
N and C termini, which was revealed by the absence of peptide 
coverage in these regions (Figure 5). Similar mass spectrometric 
analyses of sterile HBE culture secretions (control) versus HBE 
mucus samples that were P. aeruginosa exposed revealed a virtually 
total absence of peptide coverage from the MUC5B N terminus 
and a significant reduction in peptide coverage from Cys-rich and 
C terminus regions in the PAK-exposed samples compared with 
control HBE samples. These are the regions against which most 
of the MUC5B antibodies were directed, including those used by

Henke et al. (17) and ourselves. Thus, these data suggest that there 
will be a general problem with respect to antibody-dependent mea￾surement of mucins in CF secretions in which free proteases can 
cleave the antigenically exposed regions of mucins.
The column chromatographic analyses of mucins from nor￾mal whole, i.e., nonreduced, samples revealed the expected high 
molecular weight forms for MUC5AC and MUC5B (Figure 6, 
A and B). Importantly, we found that the high molecular weight 
oligomeric structure was preserved in MUC5AC and MUC5B 
from nonreduced CF samples (Figure 6, C and D). However, in 
CF samples, we observed a dramatic reduction in MUC5B size 
and a complete loss of antigenicity of MUC5AC under reducing 
conditions. These data suggest that despite mucin intramolecular 
proteolytic cleavage, mucins in CF secretions under physiologic, 
nonreducing conditions maintain their oligomeric structure 
by intra- and intermolecular disulfide (S-S) bonds (Figure 11). 
Exposure of HBE mucus samples to HNE did not reduce sheer 
dependent viscosity, consistent with the presence of oligomeric 
mucin structures after proteolytic cleavage (Supplemental 
Figure 2). Hence, intramolecular cleavage may not affect the 
important biophysical properties of mucins that determine key 
viscoelastic and osmotic properties of mucus.
Physical and biophysical methods have been developed to measure 
mucin concentrations by antibody-independent approaches (35). 
These approaches use size-selective gel filtration techniques to iso￾late high molecular weight polymers in Vo volumes, followed by 
analysis of the molecular size and concentration of mucins by light 
scattering and refractometry, respectively. These approaches can 
underestimate mucin concentrations in proteolyzed sputum. In 
contrast, the concentration of mucins can be overestimated by the 
coelution of other large molecular weight polymers, e.g., DNA, in 
the Vo, as may be a problem for CF secretion quantitation. The pre￾dominant elution of MUC5B and MUC5AC from non￾reduced CF samples in the Vo fraction suggests that 
underestimation was not a major problem (Figure 6). 
Our approach to the DNA overestimation problem 
was to cleave all DNA with exogenous DNase prior 
to running the sample on the column. Our internal 
controls suggest that DNase treatment was effective 
in removing DNA from the Vo volume prior to densi￾tometric quantitation, indicating that there was not a 
DNA-dependent overestimation of mucin concentra￾tions (Supplemental Figure 1).
We also used an HBE model system to compare 
immunologic versus physical measurements of mucin 
concentration in control (PBS) versus proteolytic (frac￾tionated SMM) environments (Figure 9). The physical 
SEC/dRI approach detected equivalent mucin concen￾trations in both fractionated SMM and PBS environ￾ments, whereas values measured by immunologic techniques in 
parallel samples were reduced in fractionated SMM versus PBS 
samples, consistent with SMM-mediated proteolytic cleavage of 
mucin epitopes. Therefore, we posited that data from SEC/dRI 
would yield more accurate measurements of mucin concentra￾tions in CF sputum than in normal sputum.
Using biophysical measurement techniques, CF airway secre￾tions contained approximately 3-fold higher concentrations of 
secreted mucins than did normal airway secretions (Figure 10A). 
Note that the normal samples were obtained by sputum induc￾tion, as required for sputum sampling in this subject popula￾tion. Previous unpublished data in chronic obstructive pul￾monary disease (COPD) subjects have suggested that sputum 
induction may underestimate spontaneous mucus weight per￾centages (wt%) by approximately 25%. Conversely, CF lung dis￾ease is heterogeneous, with diseased areas admixed with appar￾ently normal areas. Further, CF patients have areas of their 
lungs in which mucus is so adherent that it cannot be cleared 
by coughing and, hence, are underrepresented in a sputum sam￾ple (see Figure 10B, below). Thus, wt% of CF secretions could 
be underestimated by this heterogeneity. On balance, it appears 
likely that diseased areas in the CF lung are characterized by 
mucin hyperconcentration.
However, it was important to test whether CF mucins 
remained sufficiently intact to exert the predicted pathophys￾iologic defects from increased concentrations. In a new formu￾lation describing the biophysical basis of mucus transport, the 
transportability of the mucus layer in health requires that the 
partial osmotic pressure of the mucins in the mucus layer be 
lower than the partial osmotic pressure of the high molecular 
weight polymers in a newly defined periciliary gel layer (2). In 
Figure 8

of mucus plugs and intracellular mucins in CF lungs.

mucins were expressed by airway goblet cells and partic￾ipated in mucus plugs. Scale bars: 100 μm (Bronchi and 
Bronchiole columns); 25 μm (Epithelium column).

vitro data have suggested that the periciliary gel is composed of 
tethered mucins and other high molecular weight glycoconju￾gates that are, surprisingly, denser than the secreted mucins in 
the normal mucus layer (2, 36). This notion is consistent with 
the observation that the partial osmotic pressure of the peri￾ciliary layer is approximately 500 Pa as compared with approx￾imately 100 Pa predicted for a normal mucus layer. This new 
paradigm predicts that as the hydration of the airway surface 
decreases, as with CF, water preferentially leaves the mucus 
layer, and its partial osmotic pressure rises. When the osmotic 
pressure of the mucus layer approximates that of the PCL, the 
mucus layer begins to compress the PCL, and ciliary beating and 
mucus transport become unstable. At levels at which the partial 
osmotic pressure of the mucus layer greatly exceeds that of the 
PCL, cilia collapse, and the mucus layer is compressed onto the 
CF airway surfaces and becomes adherent, even in response to 
coughing. Thus, a key question with respect to our studies was 
whether the mucins in the CF lung with an actively proteolytic 
environment maintained their osmotic properties.
A technique to measure osmotic pressures of the mucins (par￾tial osmotic pressures) had been developed and was modified for 
measuring partial osmotic pressures in sputum samples (2). As 
shown in Figure 10B, the partial osmotic pressure of induced 
sputum from normal subjects was approximately 100 Pa, closely 
approximating the values suggested by modeling studies and 
studies of normal HBE cultures in vitro. The partial osmotic 
pressure of the sputum obtained from CF subjects was in the 
500-Pa range, close to the partial osmotic pressure of the PCL. 
This is precisely within the range that might be predicted for 
mucus to be poorly cleared and moderately adherent, but able to 
be cleared by coughing. Importantly, CF airway secretions that 
could not be cleared by coughing, i.e., those obtained from direct 
removal of secretions from CF lungs excised at transplantation, 
exhibited very high partial osmotic pressures, i.e., pressures 
greater than 1,000 Pa. Note that the partial osmotic pressures 
were a direct function of the mucus % solids, an accurate index 
of mucin concentration, as shown in Supplemental Figure 3. 
Thus, these data suggest that CF secretions exhibit the osmotic 
pressures predicted by mucin concentrations, i.e., mucin polymer 
osmotic properties and are not grossly affected by proteolysis. 
The analysis of the ability of CF mucus to be cleared based on 
% solids and/or osmotic pressure may serve as a useful biomarker 
for novel therapies to treat CF lung disease.
Based on these data, we hypothesize that the following scenario 
may occur in the CF airway. Initially, CF mucins are likely het￾erogeneously concentrated by the volume depletion that results 
from absent CFTR function and an exogenous stress, e.g., viral 
infection or aspiration (37). Concentrated mucins produce mucus 
adhesion to airway surfaces with resultant bacterial infection and 
inflammation. With persistent bacterial infection and consequent 
inflammation, CF airway epithelia remodel to exhibit goblet cell 
hyperplasia and consequent increased mucin gene transcription. 
This latter notion is consistent with the measured elevation in 
mucin mRNA for MUC5AC and MUC5B, as shown in Figure 7. 
Mucin RNA transcripts are translated into MUC5AC and MUC5B 
proteins that are O-glycosylated and stored. Although there have 
been reports of an absence of goblet cell hyperplasia in CF (38), 
our data (Figure 8) and those of others (15) would suggest that the 
increase in MUC5B and MUC5AC in RNA is associated with goblet 
cell hyperplasia. The secreted MUC5AC and MUC5B proteins are 
attacked in the lumen by proteolytic enzymes released by inflam￾matory cells and bacteria, and the naked epitopes are degraded, 
but the macromolecules are held in place by the persistence of 
disulfide bonds between intra- and intermolecular cysteines. This 
latter notion rests on the relative absence of a change in size versus 
a large loss of immunoreactivity when comparing unreduced and 
reduced CF samples by Sepharose chromatography (Figure 6) and 
on the maintenance of molecular mass following elastase exposure 
(Figure 3B). These data would therefore suggest that non-New￾tonian properties will be maintained by intact mucin macromol￾ecules in infected CF mucus (Supplemental Figure 2). Thus, the 
increased CF mucin concentrations will exert increased osmotic 
effects (Figure 10B) and abnormal viscoelastic properties (39) at 
both the early preinfected and the later mucoinfected stages of CF.

(100-kDa cutoff) and analyzed for MUC5B by agarose Western blotting (A) or SEC/dRI (B). Note the apparent decrease in MUC5B content in 
the sample incubated with fractionated SMM, as measured by immunoreactivity (*P = 0.01; n = 6) and the lack of a difference by refractometry 
measurements (P > 0.5). Mean and SEM values are indicated by major and minor horizontal bars, respectively.

In summary, mucin concentrations in CF secretions from 
young adults are approximately 3 times higher than normal 
controls as measured by physical techniques. Immunologic tech￾niques are likely not suitable for measuring mucin concentra￾tions in airway environments characterized by free proteolytic 
activities. Despite proteolysis, CF mucins appear to retain their 
polymeric structure and biophysical properties, in particular, 
their increased osmotic activity (~5 times), which may be a key 
biophysical step in achieving mucus stasis. These findings point 
to the need to measure the mucin concentrations in the hetero￾geneously affected diseased area early in the pathogenesis of CF 
lung disease, i.e., in neonates, to definitively identify the role of 
excessively concentrated mucus in initiating CF lung disease. The 
recent reports on free HNE and BAL of CF neonates suggest that 
biophysical approaches will be required for these measurements 
(34). Finally, these data suggest that logical therapies for CF lung 
disease would include means to dilute the mucins in CF secre￾tions so their osmotic pressures fall below those of the PCL and/
or reduce the rates of mucin secretion.
Methods
Collection of sputum and BAL
Samples were collected as detailed in the Supplemental Methods. Briefly, 
spontaneous sputum was collected from anonymized CF subjects or 
consented CF subjects with P. aeruginosa infection. In addition, induced 
sputum was collected from consented normal volunteers as previously 
described (35). The demographic data for each patient group are presented 
in Supplemental Table 1. Pediatric BAL samples were obtained during 
bronchoscopy for clinical indications using standard methods of collec￾tion (ref. 40 and Supplemental Methods).
Freshly excised normal and CF lungs for immunohistochemical and molecular 
measurements of mucin mRNA expression and mucin secretory cell numbers. Four￾teen non-CF and 10 CF lungs were analyzed by real-time PCR for MUC5B
and MUC5AC mRNA expression and immunochemical localization of 
MUC5AC and MUC5B (Figure 7 and Figure 8). Non-CF lung specimens 
were collected postmortem from head trauma victims after 1 to 3 days of 
mechanical ventilation. All CF specimens were collected at lung transplan￾tation without prior mechanical ventilation. Organ harvest and acceptabil￾ity criteria have previously been described in detail (41).
HBE cultures
Cartilaginous bronchi were obtained from normal lungs not eligible for 
transplantation. Cells were isolated by protease digestion, expanded on 
tissue culture plastic in bronchial epithelial growth medium, and then 
plated on an air-liquid interface (ALI) system with ALI media as previously 
described (41). The cultures were used both as a source of mucus and for 
the mucin secretion measurements (see below).
Immunological and physical measurements of mucin properties in 
sputum and cell culture samples
Reduction of samples. Samples were reduced in 10 mM DTT at 37°C for 
2 hours. Iodoacetomide (20 mM) was then added to samples for car￾boxymethylation at room temperature, in the dark for 30 minutes. The 
samples were then analyzed by slot blot or agarose gel electrophoresis 
(see below). For descriptive purposes, these samples will subsequently be 
referred to only as “reduced,” although they were also carboxymethylated.
Gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. Pediatric BAL fluid, sputum, and 
cell culture mucus samples were loaded at a constant volume (usually 
30 μl, undiluted) onto a 0.7% agarose gel in a 1X Tris-acetate-EDTA (TAE) 
buffer with 1% SDS and electrophoresed in a horizontal gel apparatus as 
previously described (42). After electrophoresis, the gel was reduced in 
10 mM DTT for 20 minutes prior to vacuum transfer onto a nitrocel￾lulose membrane. The proteins were transferred by vacuum transfer in 
4× saline-sodium citrate (SSC) buffer at 45 mbar for 1.5 hours. Mem￾branes were then probed for mucins using specific antibodies raised 
against MUC5AC (12) and MUC5B (43).
MUC5B purification and incubation with proteases
MUC5B was isolated from saliva, collected anonymously from nor￾mal volunteers (IRB exempted), as previously described (24). Purified 
MUC5B (100 μg/ml) was dialyzed against PBS, preheated to 37°C, and

was used to determine changes in values between normal and CF 
samples, indicating a significant increase in total mucin concentration 
in CF samples (*P = 0.001). (B) Relationship between the osmotic

CF lungs at the time of transplantation (black triangles). Red dashed 
line represents the best fit with a log-log correlation coefficient of 0.928. 
Black horizontal dashed line represents the predicted osmotic pres￾sure of the PCL. Note that mucus osmotic pressures above the black 
dashed line are predicted to produce PCL collapse.

Mass spectrometry of mucins to determine protein integrity
Mass spectrometric analyses of purified mucins were performed as 
described previously (35). Mucins were first purified from sputum or cell 
culture mucus samples by isopycnic density gradient centrifugation with a 
starting density of 1.45 g/ml. Samples were subjected to ultracentrifugation 
at 145,000 g for approximately 65 hours. The samples were then unloaded 
into 2-ml fractions (total of 20 fractions) and analyzed via slot blot and gel 
electrophoresis. PAS-rich mucin fractions were pooled, reduced, alkylated, 
and subjected to trypsin digestion. Tryptic peptides were subjected to liq￾uid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in a Waters 
Micro-Q mass spectrometer for mucin coverage (33, 35, 45).
Column chromatography for characterization of mucin oligomeric 
state in whole versus reduced conditions
Unreduced and reduced sputum or cell culture samples were diluted and 
fractionated on a Sepharose CL-2B column. Fractions were collected and 
subjected to PAS and mucin immunoblotting by slot blot analyses as 
described previously (46).
Measurement of mucin concentrations using SEC/dRI
Sputum samples were diluted 1:5 in PBS containing DNase (10 units) and 
CaCl2 (1 mM) and incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature. Samples 
were then mixed 1:1 with 6 M GuHCl before analysis. In brief, an aliquot 
(100 μl) of the diluted sputum samples was chromatographed on a Sephar￾ose CL-2B size exclusion column (15 × 2.5 cm) and eluted with 0.2 M NaCl 
(with 10 mM EDTA) at a flow rate of 500 μl/minute. The column effluent 
was passed through an in-line enhanced optimal system laser photometer 
(Dawn; Wyatt Technology) coupled to a digital signal-processing inferom￾etric refractometer (Optilab; Wyatt Technology) to continuously measure 
light scattering and sample concentrations, respectively. Note that molec￾ular size, as measured by light scattering, was used to identify and define 
the mucin peak. The captured data were integrated and analyzed with the 
Astra software provided with the Dawn laser photometer. Optimum dilu￾tions were sought by trial and error, and then paired values were obtained 
to check reproducibility, which was within 5% on average. Absolute values of 
mucin concentration were determined from the differential refractometry by 
measuring the specific refractive index increment called dn/dc that reflects 
the deviation of the refractive index by concentration. A dn/dc of 0.165 ml/g 
was used for mucins, which was used previously for the same (47).
incubated with proteases, 1 μg/ml trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich, modified 
from porcine pancreas), and 1 μg/ml human elastase from human neu￾trophils (MP Biomedicals) for 5, 20, 60, and 240 minutes. SDS-PAGE 
running buffer (in 8 M urea) was added to the samples to stop the reac￾tion at each time point. An aliquot from the starting sample treated 
with PBS served as a control. Samples were then subjected to agarose gel 
electrophoresis and immunoblotted with 2 different MUC5B antibod￾ies, including a monoclonal antibody (44) and polyclonal antisera (43). 
Also, an aliquot from samples was subjected to SEC/MALS/dRI analy￾ses. Samples were chromatographed on a Sepharose CL-2B (2 × 5 ml) 
column and eluted with PBS at a flow rate of 400 μl/minute. The col￾umn effluent was passed through an online Dawn (Wyatt Technology) 
MALS instrument coupled to a Wyatt Optilab inferometric refractome￾ter to measure molecular mass and mucin concentration, respectively. 
The captured data were integrated and analyzed with the Astra software 
provided with the Dawn instrument.
“Normal” versus concentrated mucus harvested from HBE cell 
cultures with and without exposure to P. aeruginosa
Mucus was harvested from HBE cell cultures and concentrated to 2.5% sol￾ids (i.e., “normal” concentration) or 8% solids (“CF-like” concentration) as 
previously described (26). These 2 different concentrations of HBE mucus 
were incubated for 72 hours with a lab strain of P. aeruginosa (PAO1, 5 × 103
CFU) or a mutant form of P. aeruginosa (PAO-JPI, 5 × 103 CFU) lacking the 
lasI quorum-sensing gene, which controls P. aeruginosa elastase gene expres￾sion and therefore expresses minimal elastase activity (27). Mucus was then 
harvested at 72 hours for mucin analyses by agarose Western blotting and 
for peptide coverage by mass spectrometry.
Measurement of lactoferrin
The lactoferrin content of pediatric BAL fluids was measured by a sand￾wich ELISA using a lactoferrin IgG for capture (Accurate Chemical) and 
lactoferrin IgG-HRP for detection (Cappel, MP Biomedicals). After coat￾ing with lactoferrin IgG, the microtiter plates were washed and blocked 
with 2% BSA and 0.1% Tween-20 in PBS, and 90 μl of BAL fluid was added 
to each well for a 30-minute incubation at room temperature. The plates 
were washed with PBST and developed with o-phenylenediamine dihydro￾chloride. Standards, consisting of commercial human lactoferrin (L4040; 
Sigma-Aldrich) were applied to the same plates as the samples.

Proposed effect of proteolytic cleavages on mucin integrity. Two mucin monomers are depicted, with glycosylated tandem repeat mucin domains 
depicted in green and “naked” Cys domains and N and C termini depicted in gray. Enlargements (below) show naked N- and C-terminal protein 
regions, where the molecules that are susceptible to proteolysis (highlighted by lightning bolts) oligomerize (C- to C- and N- to N-) and cystein-rich 
regions that are also protease targets. Depending on the cleavage site(s), antibody immunoreactivity will be affected by these cleavages. Con￾versely, macromolecular integrity of the mucins are not immediately affected by cleavage, since the oligomers are held together by disulfide bonds.

designed direct-membrane osmometer. For these studies, a 25-mm￾diameter, 10-kDa molecular weight cutoff polyethersulfone membrane 
(Millipore) separated the test chamber from the reference chamber that was 
filled with PBS. This membrane allowed salt and small peptides and pro￾teins to freely permeate, while retaining larger proteins, including mucins. 
To permit direct comparisons of mucus % solids and mucin concentrations, 
both measurements were made in a series of sputum samples collected from 
normal and CF subjects. The complex viscosity of the NE-treated samples 
(Supplemental Figure 2) was determined by shear dependence of the viscos￾ity on a rheometer as detailed in the Supplemental Methods.
Reagents used for the experiments
Reagents used for the experiments include the following: DTT, sodium 
metabisulfite solution (0.4 g metabisulfite per 400 ml water with 4 ml HCl), 
periodic acid solution, 10× TBST (12.1 g Tris HCl, 87.6 g NaCl, and 5.0 g 
Tween-20), 50× TAE (242 g Tris, 57.1 g acetic acid, 14.61 g EDTA), 20× SSC 
(350.6 g sodium chloride, 176.4 g trisodium citrate), SDS, and guanidine 
hydrochloride (GuHCl) solubilizing solution (0.1 Tris-HCl, 5 mM EDTA in 
6 M GuCl, pH 8.0). Antibodies to detect mucins are shown in Table 1, with 
references. EU-MUC5Ba antibody was a gift from Karine Rousseau (Faculty 
of Life Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom).
Statistics
Results of relative mucin gene mRNA expression were expressed as means 
and individual values. Statistical analyses were performed using standard￾ized 2-tailed t tests. A P value less than 0.05 was considered the minimum 
acceptable probability for the difference between the means. Mucin con￾centrations, intensities of mucin immunoreactivity, and osmotic pressure 
between groups were compared for significance by independent samples 
2-tailed t tests using MedCalc statistical software.
Study approval
All human experimental protocols, including tissue procurement, were 
approved by the IRB of the University of North Carolina, with the excep￾tion of the anonymized CF samples. These were exempted from formal 
IRB review due to lack of patient identifiers and the intention of being 
otherwise discarded.

Measurements of airway mucins MUC5AC and MUC5B in mRNA 
and mucin secretory cell numbers
Mucin mRNA by quantitative PCR. Total mRNA was extracted from CF 
(n = 10) and non-CF (n = 14) cartilaginous mainstem bronchi (~0.8 cm 
in diameter). Cross sections of mainstem bronchi were carefully dis￾sected free and opened longitudinally. Surface cells were gently scraped 
(excluding submucosal glands as verified by histology), placed in RNAl￾ater (Ambion), and processed for mRNA extraction according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions. Total mRNA quality was determined using 
an mRNA bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). The following prim￾ers were used for MUC5AC: 5′-AGCTACCCTGCTCCTGGAAT-3′ and 
5′-GTGGGAGCTGGTTCTTGTTC-3′. The following primers were used 
for MUC5B: 5′-CTGGCACCTGCTCTGTGCA-3′ and 5′-CACTGCTTT￾GAGGCAGTTCT-3′. Analysis of mRNA amplification was conducted via 
a LightCycler 480 II (Roche Diagnostics) reading SYBR green signal.
Immunocytochemical analysis of lung tissues. Cross sections of mainstem 
bronchi (~0.8 cm) and bronchioles (<0.5 mm) were fixed and processed for 
histologic analyses. Consecutive sections of these specimens were stained 
by AB-PAS or immunolabeled with an anti-MUC5AC (48) (45M1; Santa 
Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) or an anti-MUC5B (MUC5B222) antibody (49). 
Signal was revealed via DAB and detected via a transmitted light micro￾scope (Nikon Microphot) and captured with a Nikon DXM 1200 camera.
Direct comparison measurements of mucin concentration by 
immunologic and biophysical techniques following mucin secretion 
into an SMM from excised CF lungs
SMM, a gift from Carla Ribeiro (UNC CF Center, Chapel Hill, North 
Carolina, USA), was generated by aspirating the intraluminal mucopu￾rulent material from freshly excised CF lungs at the time of transplanta￾tion (30). The harvested material was then ultracentrifuged and filtered 
through 0.45-μm membranes to remove bacteria. This “neat” SMM was 
used in 72-hour HBE exposures. A second aliquot of SMM was further 
fractionated through “fractioned” 100K cutoff membranes to remove 
the endogenous mucins and other high molecular weight substances 
that would add background to measurements. HBE cultures grown at 
an ALI were treated with SMM for 72 hours to induce inflammation and 
mucin secretory cell hyperplasia (30). The SMM-treated cultures were 
then washed free of SMM with PBS and challenged for 1 hour with a 
mucin secretagogue, ATPγS (100 μM), in a small volume of PBS (60 μl). 
After this 1-hour incubation, the cultures were exposed to an additional 
30 μl PBS (control) or 30 μl of fractionated SMM, incubated for 2 hours, 
and the apical surface was then sampled and aliquots reserved for mucus 
quantitation by Western blotting and SEC/dRI.
Measurement of mucus solids content, osmotic pressure, mucin 
concentrations, and viscosity
The percentate of solid content of mucus, an index of hydration, was cal￾culated by measuring wet/dry weights with a microbalance (UMX2; Met￾tler Toledo) (2). The osmotic pressures of normal sputum, CF sputum, 
and secretions from excised CF lung samples were measured with modi￾fications of previously described techniques (2). Briefly, a 300-μl aliquot 
of each sample was gently placed on the membrane surface of a custom￾1. Davis PB. Cystic fibrosis since 1938. Am J Respir Crit
