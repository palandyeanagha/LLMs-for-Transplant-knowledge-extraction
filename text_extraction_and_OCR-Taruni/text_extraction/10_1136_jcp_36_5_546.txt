Abstract
The histopathological changes in the lungs of 32 patients who died
after bone marrow transplantation for leukaemia have been studied
and compared with those found in 21 patients treated by
conventional chemotherapy. The transplanted patients exhibited a
higher incidence of interstitial pneumonitis, vascular lesions and
viral infections, particularly cytomegalovirus (CMV), although
bacterial and fungal diseases were commoner in the non-grafted


subjects. The pathogenesis of interstitial pneumonitis is discussed
with specific reference to the possible roles of irradiation,
chemotherapy, viruses and the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin
A. Ten patients died of a syndrome characterised clinically by fever,
skin rash, fluid retention, uraemia, low serum albumin
concentrations, low central venous pressure and acute pulmonary
oedema. These patients exhibited intra-alveolar haemorrhagic
fibrinous exudation with or without interstitial changes. The
aetiology of this syndrome is not known but it occurs more
frequently in recipients of mismatched grafts and evidence is
presented suggesting that viruses may play a significant causative
role. No lesion was identified that could be directly attributed to
Graft-versus-Host disease.
