Flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood
lymphocytes in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease
M Senju, F Hulstaert, J Lowder, D P Jewell
Abstract
Using two colour immunofluorescence with
fluorescein isothiocyanate and phycoerythrin
labelled monoclonal antibodies, multi￾parameter flow cytometry was used to examine
the antigenic characteristics of peripheral
blood lymphocytes in whole blood of patients
with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease who
were not taking immunosuppressive drugs.
The numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ lympho￾cytes in patients with ulcerative colitis and
Crohn's disease remained unchanged so that
the CD4/CD8 ratio was the same as that of
normal control subjects. In Crohn's disease
there were many activated T cells (CD3+,
CD25+). Although natural killer cells in active
Crohn's disease were lower than in normal
control subjects, cytotoxic T lymphocytes, as
defined by CD3+, CD16+, did not differ in
patients with inflammatory bowel disease com￾pared with normal control subjects. For B cell
subsets, there were differences in Leu-1 + B
cells, Leu-8+ B cells, FceR+B cells
(Leu-16+, Leu-20+), and activated B cells
(Leu-12+, Leu-21+) between patients with
inflammatory bowel disease and normal con￾trol subjects. These differences are compatible
with local activation of B cells in the inflamed
colon.

Although the aetiology and pathogenesis of in￾flammatory bowel disease are still unknown,
immunological factors seem to be involved.'
Inflammatory bowel disease shows a variety of
prominent immunological abnormalities.
The development of monoclonal antibodies to
cell surface antigens has allowed detail charac￾terisation of subpopulations of lymphoid cells.
Surface marker identification can be performed
by immunofluorescence and immunoperoxidase
techniques on tissue sections or on isolated
lymphoid cells. Flow cytometry utilises rapid
automated counting of large numbers of cells,
which permits multiple surface markers to be
analysed. Flow cytometry can also provide a
quantitative measurement of fluorescence in￾tensity which may be related to receptor density.2
Monoclonal antibodies and immunofluorescence
analysis by flow cytometry provide a highly
sensitive and specific approach to phenotypic
analysis of human lymphocyte subsets. The use
of simultaneous two colour immunofluorescence
that utilises two different antibodies, one labelled
with fluorescein isothiocyanate, the other with
phycoerythrin, has added a new dimension to
this type of analysis. Furthermore, the use of a
whole blood assay avoids the use of density
gradient centrifugation, which might potentially
alter the ratios of lymphocyte subsets.
The aim of the present study was to investigate
lymphocyte subpopulations in whole blood of
patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's
disease, who. were not taking immunosuppres￾sive treatment. Two colour immunofluorescence
staining and multiparameter flow cytometry
were used.
Methods
PATIENT POPULATION
Peripheral blood was obtained from 60 patients
with ulcerative colitis and 31 patients with
Crohn's disease. The diagnosis was based on
clinical, endoscopic, histological, and radio￾logical features of the disease. The mean age of
the patients with ulcerative colitis (30 men, 30
women) was 47 years (range 17-85 years).
Disease activity of ulcerative colitis was assessed
by the method of Truelove and Witts.3 The
colitis was active in 41 patients and inactive in 19.
The mean age of the 31 patients with Crohn's
disease (12 men, 19 women) was 48 years (range
22-81 years). The criteria of de Dombal et al
were used to determine disease activity.4 Twelve
patients had active disease, while in 19 patients it
was quiescent. No patient had been treated with
steroids within one month of entry to the study
nor had immunosuppressive treatment within
six months of entry.
NORMAL CONTROL SUBJECTS
Twenty three healthy subjects (15 men, 8 women)
with a mean age of 33 years (range 20-47 years)
were studied.

MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES
Fifteen pairs of monoclonal antibodies con￾jugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate and
phycoerythrin were used. All monoclonal anti￾bodies were prepared at the Becton Dickinson
Monoclonal Center (Mountain View, CA). The
specificities of the reagents used in this study are
given in Table I. They were all directly conju￾gated with fluorescein isothiocyanate or
phycoerythrin.
TWO COLOUR DIRECT IMMUNOFLUORESCENCE
STAINING OF WHOLE BLOOD
Whole blood collected by venepuncture with
ethylenediamine tetra-acetate was used for
staining; 100 1d of anticoagulated whole blood
was placed into 12 x 75 mm polystyrene tubes
(Falcon Plastics, Oxnard, CA); 20 >d of each
monoclonal reagent was added to each tube. The
tubes were incubated for 15 minutes at room
temperature in the dark. 2 ml of 1 x FACS
Lysing Solution (Becton Dickinson) was added
to each tube. The samples were then agitated and
incubated for 10 minutes. The samples were
washed once in Dulbecco's modified phosphate
buffered saline without calcium and magnesium
(Gibco, UK) containing 0. 1% sodium azide. The
cell sediment was resuspended in 0 5% para￾formaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline. The
fixed cells were stored at 4°C in the dark until
analysis.

performed with a FACScan (Becton Dickinson,
FACS Division, Sunnyvale, CA). SimulSET
software (Becton Dickinson) was used for the
flow cytometric data acquisition, data analysis,
and report generation in two colour flow cyto￾metric experiments and lymphocyte subset
analysis. SimulSET software uses a LeucoGATE
(HLe-1 FITC+Leu-M3 PE, Becton Dickinson
Immunocytometry Systems, Mountain View,
CA) sample to compute the optimum lympho￾cyte gate for an individual patient. Subsequent
samples for the same patient are analysed using
this gate. In determining the quadrant markers,
SimulSET software uses the second sample in
the panel of monoclonal antibodies, stained with
Simultest Control reagent (lgGl FITC+lgG2
PE, Becton Dickinson) to compute the optimum
fluorescence quadrant markers for the patient.
Each sample following LeucoGATE and Simul￾test Control is automatically gated, and the data
are analysed and reported. Percentages are calcu￾lated based on the number of lymphocytes found
in each quadrant and corrections are made
to account for non-lymphocyte contamination
within the lymphocyte gate.
STATISTICAL METHODS
Statistical analysis of results was performed by
using Student's paired or unpaired t test, and a
probability of less than 5% was considered to be
significant.
Results
Tables II and III show the percentages and
absolute numbers (mean (SD)) of singly
fluorescent peripheral blood lymphocytes
expressing monoclonal antibodies, Leu-4 (CD3),
CD4, CD8, Leu-12 (CD19), and the CD4/CD8
ratio in normal control subjects and patients with
ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. There was
a significant decrease in the proportion of B cells
in patients with inactive disease. There was a
higher proportion of CD8 + lymphocytes in
inactive ulcerative colitis but the CD4/CD8 ratio
did not change significantly.
The phenotype of CD8+ cells and CD4+ cells
was further investigated using two colour
immunofluorescent staining (Table IV). The
proportion of CD8+, Leu-8- cells was higher in
patients with inactive ulcerative colitis (p<0-0 1).
CD8+, Leu-8+ cells collaborate with CD8+,
Leu-8- cells to generate suppression of B cell
differentiation.5
The percentages of CD4+, Leu-8+ cells
(suppressor-inducer T) and CD4+, Leu-8-
cells (helper-inducer T) remained unchanged in
inflammatory bowel disease. These subpopula￾tions of CD4+ cells were also detected using the
CD4, Leu-18 (CD45R) combination. CD4+,
CD45R+ lymphocytes (suppressor-inducer T)
were lower in inactive ulcerative colitis. The
percentage of CD4+, CD45R- cells (helper￾inducer T) in inactive disease groups was signifi￾cantly increased (p<0-01) (Table IV).
The percentage of activated T cells (CD3+,
IL-2R+) in Crohn's disease was significantly
increased compared with control subjects (p<0Q05). Although CD3+, HLA-DR+

increased compared with control subjects, this
difference was not significant (Table V).
Cytotoxic lymphocyte subsets identified by
monoclonal antibodies Leu-7, Leu-11 (CD16),
and Leu-19 were also investigated (Table VI).
There was no significant difference in the pro￾portion of cytotoxic T lymphocytes between
control subjects and patients with inflammatory
bowel disease. Natural killer cells (CD3-,
CD16+, Leu-19+) were significantly decreased
in patients with active Crohn's disease (p<005).
The proportion of Leu-7+, CD8+ lymphocytes
and Leu-7+, CD3+ cells was significantly
higher in inactive disease groups than in control
subjects (inactive ulcerative colitis: p<OOOl,
inactive Crohn's disease: p<O005).
Examination of B cell subsets showed a
decrease in the proportion of Leu-1+ (CD5) B
cells (Table VII). A significantly lower propor￾tion of Leu-8+ B cells was present in inactive
Crohn's disease compared with control subjects
(p<0O 1). Loss of Leu-8 antigens has been
shown to be associated with initial activation of B
cells. In active inflammatory bowel disease, there
was no difference in the proportion of B cells
expressing FceR (CD23), but in inactive
disease the proportion of these cells was signifi￾cantly decreased compared with that in control
subjects (inactive ulcerative colitis: p<O005, in￾active Crohn's disease: p<OO1). Leu-21 recog￾nises an antigen expressed by activated B cells.

Discussion
Lymphocyte subsets in whole blood of normal
subjects and of patients with active and inactive
ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease were in￾vestigated by using monoclonal antibodies and
multiparameter flow cytometry. There have
been several studies of peripheral blood lympho￾cyte subsets in patients with ulcerative colitis and
Crohn's disease. The initial study by Selby and
Jewell showed that, although the absolute
numbers of T lymphocytes might be low, there
was no change in the proportion of CD4+ and
CD8+ cells.6 Subsequently, not all studies have
agreed with this, as shown in Table VIII. The
reasons for the discrepancies have been
attributed to the small numbers of patients
studied in some series, the different methods
used, and the possible effect of treatment. There￾fore, the aim of this study was to use a whole
blood assay (to avoid artefacts created by density
gradient solution procedures), to use a highly
sensitive technique with double labelling, and to
investigate patients who had not received corti￾costeroid or immunosuppressive drugs within a
defined period of time. B cell markers were also
investigated.
In many patients with autoimmune disorders,
the CD4/CD8 ratio is increased, reflecting a
relative or absolute deficiency of CD8+ cells. 16 17
Although CD8+ lymphocytes were low in
inactive ulcerative colitis, the CD4/CD8 ratio did
not change.
In previous studies cells with the CD4+,
Leu-8- phenotype have been shown to contain
the majority of helper function involved in B cell
differentiation into plaque forming cells.' In
patients with inflammatory bowel disease the
ratio of CD4+ Leu-8- to CD4 Leu-8+ cells
remained unchanged. The CD4+ cells can be
subdivided by monoclonal antibodies reacting
with different epitopes of the high molecular
weight T200 common leucocyte antigen
(CD45R). These monoclonal antibodies are
Leu-18,'8 2H4,'9 and 3AC5 and G1-5.20 The
CD4+ cells expressing the CD45R antigen have
been reported to possess a T suppressor-inducer
function, whereas those helper cells lacking
CD45R show a CD4+ inducer function.'9 The
percentage of cells with the CD4+, CD45R+
phenotype from patients with inactive ulcerative
colitis was decreased with a corresponding in￾crease in the CD4+, CD45R- phenotype. The
slightly different results between CD4, Leu-8
and CD4, CD45R phenotypes of the present
study may be explained by the different distribu￾tion of the Leu-8 antigen and CD45R antigen. '`
Our findings differ slightly from those of James
et al,2 who found no major differences of CD4
subpopulations defined by 2H4 (CD45RA+)
comparing Crohn's disease with control subjects.
The number of T cells expressing HLA-DR
class II molecules (CD3+, HLA-DR+) in in￾flammatory bowel disease was increased, but not
significantly. Selby and Jewell6 found that HLA￾DR antigens were detected on circulating T
lymphocytes in nine of 16 normal subjects, and

only three patients with inflammatory bowel
disease had a higher proportion of HLA-DR+ T
cells than controls. Yu et aP1 found a similar
increase in four of seven patients with Crohn's
disease. This difference might be ascribed to the
sensitivity between fluorescence microscopy and
flow cytometry. CD3+, IL-2R+ T lymphocytes
from patients with inflammatory bowel disease
were significantly increased, suggesting that cir￾culating T lymphocytes in this disorder are
activated.
The Leu-7 cell subset comprises two essen￾tially non-overlapping subpopulations, depend￾ing on whether cells are coexpressing the natural
killer cell marker CD16 (Leu-7+, CD16+
phenotype) or the pan-T cell marker CD3 (Leu￾7+, CD3+ phenotype).22 It is possible to split
Leu-7+, CD3+ cells into two subsets as follows:
about 80% of Leu-7+, CD3+ express CD8
antigen, whereas 20% express CD4 antigen.22 A
rise in these phenotypes is associated with
aging. In inactive inflammatory bowel disease
both Leu-7+, CD3+ cells and Leu-7+, CD8+
cells were increased compared with normal
control subjects. The mean age of the patients
with inactive inflammatory bowel disease is
greater than that of the control population so
these results might be attributed to aging.
Although natural killer cells are heterogeneous
with respect to expression ofcell surface differen￾tiation antigens, it has been clearly established
that the majority of peripheral blood lympho￾cytes mediating non-major histocompatibility
complex restricted cytotoxicity express the
CD1624 and Leu-19 (NKH-1) antigens.23 The
CD3+, CD16+, Leu-19+ population is a
unique subset of non-major histocompatibility
complex restricted cytotoxic CD3+ T lympho￾cytes, and CD3-, CD16+, Leu-19+ natural
killer cells are the most abundant and the most
efficient cytotoxic effectors.2526 Cytotoxic CD3+
T lymphocytes from patients with inflammatory
bowel disease showed no change, but natural
killer cells in active Crohn's disease were
decreased.
A detailed study of the phenotype of lympho￾cyte subpopulations in ulcerative colitis and
Crohn's disease has shown only minor changes in
patients compared with normal control subjects
when the disease is in remission. The importance
of the decrease in suppressor-inducer cells
(CD4+, Leu8+) in patients with inactive ulcera￾tive colitis can only be fully assessed when the
results of functional studies are known. In active
disease the phenotypic changes are compatible
with T and B cell activation.
