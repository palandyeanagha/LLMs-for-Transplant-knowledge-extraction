ABSTRACT
Objective Heart failure (HF) is one of the most
important complications in pregnant women with heart
disease, causing maternal and fetal mortality and
morbidity.
Methods This is an international observational registry
of patients with structural heart disease during
pregnancy. Sixty hospitals in 28 countries enrolled 1321
women between 2007 and 2011. Pregnant women with
valvular heart disease, congenital heart disease,
ischaemic heart disease, or cardiomyopathy could be
included. Main outcome measures were onset and
predictors of HF and maternal and fetal death.
Results In total, 173 (13.1%) of the 1321 patients
developed HF, making HF the most common major
cardiovascular complication during pregnancy. Baseline
parameters associated with HF were New York Heart
Association class ≥3, signs of HF, WHO category ≥3,
cardiomyopathy or pulmonary hypertension. HF occurred
at a median time of 31 weeks gestation (IQR 23–40)
with the highest incidence at the end of the second
trimester (34%) or peripartum (31%). Maternal mortality
was higher in patients with HF (4.8% in patients with
HF and 0.5% in those without HF p<0.001).
Pre-eclampsia was strongly related to HF (OR 7.1, 95%
CI 3.9 to 13.2, p<0.001). Fetal death and the incidence
of preterm birth were higher in women with HF
compared to women without HF (4.6% vs 1.2%,
p=0.001; and 30% vs 13%, p=0.001).
Conclusions HF was the most common complication
during pregnancy, and occurred typically at the end of
the second trimester, or after birth. It was most common
in women with cardiomyopathy or pulmonary
hypertension and was strongly associated with
pre-eclampsia and an adverse maternal and perinatal
outcome.
OBJECTIVES
Pregnancy may be considered as a physiological
stress test, revealing latent medical conditions such
as hypertension and diabetes.1 This is particularly
true for women with underlying heart disease,
where pregnancy may cause a deterioration of a
known heart condition or precipitate the presenta￾tion of an undiagnosed heart problem.1 During
pregnancy, cardiac output increases by 30–50%,
where increase in plasma volume leads to increase
in stroke volume and heart rate.2 The increase in
cardiac workload may precipitate heart failure
(HF),3–5 which is associated with significant mater￾nal and fetal morbidity and mortality.6
Despite the poor prognosis associated with the
diagnosis of HF during pregnancy, there is very
little information in the literature on the subject.
The onset of HF during pregnancy may differ
according to the underlying heart disease, and may
be related to the physiological changes during preg￾nancy, but data in the literature are scarce.
Peripartum cardiomyopathy is a pregnancy-specific
type of cardiomyopathy, where HF by definition
occurs towards the end of pregnancy or in the
months following delivery.7 In pregnant women
with valvular heart disease (VHD), HF has been
described both during pregnancy and after deliv￾ery.8–10 Labour and delivery are considered a par￾ticularly high-risk period because of cardiac stress
and changes in cardiac output caused by pain,
anxiety and exertion, uterine contractions, bleed￾ing, anaesthesia, autotransfusion from the involut￾ing uterus, and resorption of oedema.6 8–13
In pregnant women with underlying heart disease,
the risk of developing complications depends on the
type and severity of cardiac disease.2 5 9 14–19 Large
cohort studies have focused on prediction of a com￾posite endpoint of cardiac events (arrhythmia, HF
and other cardiovascular complications).2–4 This
approach fails to distinguish between the relatively
easily managed complications, such as most supra￾ventricular arrhythmias, and the more severe com￾plications, such as HF. Therefore, in this study, we
focus on HF during pregnancy. We have investigated
the timing of the diagnosis of HF, its associations
and the factors which predict its occurrence in a
large cohort of pregnant women with structural or
ischaemic heart disease (IHD).
METHODS
Study design
The Registry On Pregnancy And Cardiac disease
(ROPAC) was established in 2007 (see online
appendix for more information). Sixty hospitals in
28 countries enrolled 1321 pregnant women with
structural heart disease (valvular or congenital
heart disease (CHD) or cardiomyopathy) or IHD.
Enrolled patients underwent pregnancy sometime
between 2007 and June 2011.
Data
The study protocol with definitions and the first
results of this registry were published previously.19

HF was defined in these patients with various underlying heart
diseases, according to ACC/AHA guidelines, as a clinical syn￾drome that is characterised by specific symptoms (dyspnea and
fatigue) in the medical history and signs (of fluid retention, such
as oedema, rales) on the physical examination as judged by the
treating cardiologist.20 The HF episode was only registered
when signs or symptoms of HF were present which required
new treatment, change of treatment or hospital admission.
Pulmonary hypertension was judged as such by the including
cardiologist. Countries were divided into developed or develop￾ing according to the International Monetary Fund
Classification.21 Other definitions have been described in the
overview paper which has been previously published.19 Onset
of HF in terms of gestational age was calculated using the
expected term date. When a patient developed HF after deliv￾ery, we described the timing as the number of weeks after deliv￾ery. In patients with HF during and postpregnancy, only the first
manifestation of HF was used to compute the time of HF. For
the calculation of median time of HF per diagnosis, we added
the number of weeks after delivery to 40 weeks when HF
occurred after delivery. For example, HF occurring 6 weeks
after delivery in a woman delivered at 38 weeks is calculated as
HF at 46 weeks.
We stratified the patients into four risk groups using a modi￾fied WHO risk classification for pregnant women with cardiac
disease. Dependent on diagnosis and severity of disease, risk
classification ranges from class I (low risk), to class IV (contra￾indication for pregnancy).5 22 CHD patients were further classi￾fied by complexity of heart disease, according to a generally
accepted classification.23 Diseases that were not accounted for in
this classification were scored by two authors (TPER and PGP).
Additionally, the type of heart lesion was classified into left￾sided lesions (such as aortic valve disease, mitral valve disease
and most cardiomyopathies), right-sided lesions (such as
Ebstein’s anomaly, tetralogy of Fallot, pulmonary stenosis) and
shunt lesions (such as atrial or ventricular septal defects).
The primary study end point was HF, and secondary study
endpoints included: birth weight, fetal death (defined as fetal
death after 22 weeks of pregnancy or birth weight 500 g), neo￾natal death, low birth weight (<2500 g), premature birth
(<37 weeks of gestation) or Apgar score <7. Other complica￾tions collected included symptomatic supraventricular tachycar￾dia (either paroxysmal or permanent), symptomatic ventricular
arrhythmias (excluding ventricular extra beats), thromboembolic
complications (including mechanical valve thrombosis, venous
thromboembolism and cerebrovascular event) and bleeding
complications (requiring transfusion). This study focuses on HF.
Data on follow-up was complete in 96% of patients. More
detailed information on maternal and fetal outcome, in general,
can be found in the overview article.19
Statistical methods
Categorical data are presented as frequencies (numbers) and per￾centages. One-sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests and histo￾grams were used to check normality of continuous data.
Normally distributed continuous data are presented as mean
values±one SD, whereas data which were not normally distribu￾ted were presented as medians with IQR. Differences in categor￾ical data between independent patient groups were compared by
χ2 tests. Fisher’s exact tests were applied if any expected cell
count was less than five. Differences in continuous data between
independent patient groups were compared by Student t tests.
Adjusted birth weight was calculated using a linear regression,
and was adjusted for gestational age, smoking, fetal sex,
maternal age, diabetes and pre-eclampsia. Univariable logistic
regression analysis was performed to identify baseline patient
characteristics (before pregnancy) associated with HF. The fol￾lowing baseline variables were assessed: CHD, VHD, cardiomy￾opathy, IHD, right-sided lesion, left-sided lesion, shunt lesion,
NYHA (New York Heart Association) class ≥3, modified WHO
class ≥3, atrial fibrillation (either paroxysmal or permanent),
nulliparity, hypertension (hypertension (systolic >140 mm Hg
or diastolic >90 mm Hg before pregnancy or the use of antihy￾pertensive treatment), smoking (before and during pregnancy),
developing versus developed countries (according to
International Monetary Fund classification), signs of HF, pul￾monary hypertension, mechanical valves and the use of any
medication before pregnancy. Echocardiographic data (fractional
shortening <30% or systolic ventricular function (qualitatively
scored with eyeballing) normal/moderate/severely impaired: sys￾temic or pulmonary) were used only in the univariable regres￾sion, since adequate data were only available in 259 patients.
Parameters developing during pregnancy, such as diabetes and
pre-eclampsia were not taken into account in this univariable
and multivariable analysis, since the goal was to construct a pre￾pregnancy risk model. We excluded patients with a first mani￾festation of peripartum cardiomyopathy in the current
pregnancy for the univariable and multivariable analysis only,
since we intended to predict the occurrence of HF from baseline
data in women with known structural or IHD, while women
with a first manifestation of peripartum cardiomyopathy were
by definition healthy at baseline. Variables that were associated
with an increased incidence of the studied endpoints (p<0.15)
entered the multivariable analysis. Unless specified otherwise, p
values <0.05 (2-sided test) were considered statistically signifi￾cant. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS V.20.0
(SPSS, Chicago, USA).
RESULTS
Baseline characteristics
Of the 1321 enrolled patients, 173 (13.1%) developed HF during
pregnancy or after delivery, including 16 cases of HF during delivery
not included in the previous publication.19 Baseline characteristics of
patients with and without HF are shown in table 1. There was a sig￾nificant difference in type of lesion (p<0.001), with more women
with HF having left-sided lesions (68% vs 45%). By contrast, fewer
women with HF had a right-sided lesion (12% vs 27%) or a shunt
lesion (20% vs 27%). Of all shunt lesions 35% of patient had uncor￾rected shunts and 10% of patients had some degree of pulmonary
hypertension. Different diagnoses are displayed in figure 1. In total,
71 patients with HF had CHD, 64 had VHD and 36 had CMP. In
patients with available echocardiographic data, patients with HF had
a lower mean fractional shortening at baseline than patients without
HF (31% vs 36% p=0.007).
Predictors of HF
The results of the univariable and multivariable logistic regres￾sion are shown in table 2. Independent baseline parameters
associated with HF were NYHA class ≥3 and signs of HF prior
to pregnancy, WHO category ≥3, cardiomyopathy or pulmon￾ary hypertension. During pregnancy, a diagnosis of pre￾eclampsia was related to the occurrence of HF with an OR of
7.1 (95% CI 3.9 to 13.2 p<0.001). Of all patients in the regis￾try who developed pre-eclampsia, 30% developed HF as well.
Of patients with pre-eclampsia and HF, 29% had peripartum
cardiomyopathy, 29% mitral valve disease, 14% other cardiomy￾opathies and 14% an ASD. In the univariable analysis, CHD
was associated with a lower risk of HF than other diagnoses

with an OR of 0.3 (95% CI 0.2 to 0.4). When corrected for
other univariable predictors of HF in a multivariable model,
this was still significant with an OR of 0.40 (95% CI 0.23 to
0.62 p<0.001). Uncorrected shunts were not a significant pre￾dictor in neither univariable nor multivariable analysis. HF
occurred more often in patients with shunt lesions who had pul￾monary hypertension (7% vs 41% p<0.001). Concomitant
valvular disease did not contribute to HF in patients with shunt
lesion. Of patients with persistent duct, 23% had HF, these
were mainly patients with pulmonary hypertension, or an
uncorrected shunt or concomitant valvular disease. In patients
with mitral stenosis and/or mitral regurgitation HF occurred
relatively often (table 3); 35% of these patients had pulmonary
hypertension.
Onset of HF
Median onset of HF was at 31 weeks of gestation (IQR 23–40). Of
all patients with HF, 106 (61%) had HF only during pregnancy, 40
(23%) only after delivery and 27 (16%) during pregnancy and after
delivery. HF occurred in 7% in the first trimester, 34% occurred in
the second trimester, 28% in the third trimester, 10% at delivery
and 21% postpartum. More detailed timing of HF is displayed in
figure 2. There is a peak in weeks 23–30 of gestation, and in the
first weeks after delivery. Of the 20 patients with postpartum HF,
61% occurred in the first week after delivery; in 11 of these
patients (55%), HF occurred in the first 24 h after delivery.
Postpartum HF was encountered in peripartum cardiomyopathy
(21%), mitral regurgitation (14%), other cardiomyopathies
(10.5%) and Tetralogy of Fallot (6%). There were large differences
in frequency and timing of HF in different patient groups (table 3).
HF was common in patients with a cardiomyopathy, and occurred
mainly in the weeks around delivery. In VHD, patients HF
occurred throughout pregnancy. In patients with shunt lesions, HF
typically occurred around 25 weeks of gestation and was more
common in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. Patients
with pulmonary hypertension had HF at a mean of 29 weeks of
gestation, whereas patients without pulmonary hypertension had
HF at a mean of 31 weeks of gestation (p=0.33).
Maternal and fetal outcome
The diagnosis of HF was associated with a significantly higher
maternal mortality (p<0.001). In all but one of the patients
who did not survive, the reason of death was cardiac failure,
either acute of chronic. The patient who did not have a cardiac
reason, died of bronchopneumonia. Obstetric complications
were also more common in these patients, as shown in table 4.
Mode of delivery in patients with HF, was by emergency caesar￾ean section in 22%, by elective caesarean section in 36% and
vaginally in 40%; in 3%, mode of delivery was not recorded.
Overall, 58% of patients with HF were delivered by caesarean
section compared to 38% in patients without HF (p<0.001).
Caesarean section was for cardiac reasons in 57% of all HF
patients with a caesarean section, versus 29% in patients
without HF (p<0.001).
Fetal death occurred more often in patients with HF
(p=0.001). Birth weight was lower than 2500 g in 24% of
patients with HF, and in 13% in patients without HF
(p<0.001). Of these children, 33 (80%) were born prematurely.
Median time of delivery was 38 weeks (IQR 36–39) for patients
with HF, and 39 weeks (IQR 37–40) in patients without HF
(p<0.001). There was no correlation between onset of HF and
timing of delivery (R2
=0.003) nor was there a correlation
(R2
=0.023) between onset of HF and birth weight (corrected
for time of delivery).
DISCUSSION
In this large worldwide registry of pregnant women with under￾lying cardiac disease,19 we investigated timing and predictors of
HF. HF was the most common complication, occurring in 13% of
the patients.19 We showed that the onset of HF depended on the
underlying cardiac diagnosis, with HF most frequently diagnosed
in the second or third trimester, or shortly after delivery. HF was
found most often in women with poor prepregnancy cardiac func￾tion, with a diagnosis of cardiomyopathy or pulmonary hyperten￾sion. Patients with HF had a higher rate of adverse maternal and
fetal outcomes. Furthermore, this is the first study to identify spe￾cific predictors for the occurrence of HF.
Rate of HF in relation to different underlying cardiac diagnoses
In this registry, the rates of HF in various diagnoses slightly
differ from reported rates in the literature. For simple diagnoses,
such as mitral regurgitation, aortic coarctation, aortic abnormal￾ities and shunt lesions, rates of HF are high in this registry when
compared to the literature.24 25 This may be partially explained
by the high percentage of pulmonary hypertension in some of
the lesions, such as mitral stenosis and/or regurgitation and
uncorrected shunt lesions. Yap et al26 27 described a higher rate

of complications in patients with uncorrected shunts, in patients
with atrial septal defects and ventricular septal defect, but none
of the women developed HF. We reported a HF rate of 3.8% in
patients with atrial switch procedure for transposition of the
great arteries which is relatively low compared to previously
reported rates of 2.7%, 4.1% and 7.1%.28–30
Predictors
In our univariable analysis, several factors were associated with an
increased or low risk of HF (table 2). The factors cardiomyopathy,
NYHA class ≥3, WHO ≥3, pre-pregnancy HF and pulmonary
hypertension remained significantly associated in the multivariate
analysis. The presence of a left-sided lesion and medication use
prior to pregnancy showed a weak association. The loss of several
of the factors of the univariable analysis suggests that their risk was
indirectly mediated through a second factor. For example, the rela￾tionship of HF with developing countries was probably due to
more severe disease, including a higher prevalence of pulmonary
hypertension. Of those factors that remained significant, the stron￾gest were prepregnancy HF and poor functional class and, in add￾ition, high risk of pregnancy as represented by high WHO class.
These are useful parameters in counselling of women with heart
disease considering pregnancy. Interestingly, WHO class was a pre￾dictor of HF in the multivariable analysis, even though this classifi￾cation was designed to predict the risk of any cardiovascular
complication and not just of HF. In the prospective study of Siu
et al, EF <40% predicted complications. We found that EF and
fractional shortening were strong univariable predictors of HF in
the subgroup of patients in which these data were available,
however, these variables could not be tested in the multivariable
model due to missing data. Pulmonary hypertension has also been
recognised as a high-risk condition and predictor for cardiovascu￾lar events in previous studies,31 32 However, pulmonary
hypertension did not predict complications in the studies of
Drenthen et al and Siu et al, probably because few patients with
pulmonary hypertension were included in their studies.3 4 In this
registry, we included patients from developing countries where the
prevalence of pulmonary hypertension is relatively high, therefore,
we could identify pulmonary hypertension as a predictor of HF.
In our series, the presence of a mechanical valve was not a
predictor of HF, but these patients are mainly at risk for other
complications, such as haemorrhage and valve thrombosis.
Similarly, IHD was not a predictor of HF, possibly because left
ventricular function may have been almost normal in most of
these patients. The number of IHD patients was very small and
more data are needed to draw conclusions regarding this patient
group. Patients with CHD had a lower risk than patients with
VHD, IHD or cardiomyopathy, but compared with the rate of
HF in the normal healthy population, this risk is still increased.
Patients with right-sided lesions and cyanotic lesions (mostly
corrected) had a lower risk than patients with left-sided lesions.
Biomarkers, such as B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), are estab￾lished markers of HF.33 However, their role during pregnancy in
women with heart disease is incompletely studied. In the study by
Tanous et al.34 BNP levels were associated with cardiovascular
events during pregnancy. Importantly, BNP levels lower than
100 pg/mL had a negative predictive value of 100% for identifying
events during pregnancy. However, since in a large proportion of
patients the BNP level was only measured at time of the event and
not before this, additional studies are clearly warranted to show
the value of BNP in prepregnancy risk models. In this registry, we
did not collect data on biomarkers.
Timing
To date, data on the timing of HF in pregnant women with
heart disease are scarce. The peripartum period is regarded as
Figure 1 Diagnosis in patients with heart failure. In green shades, cardiomyopathy (n=36); in red shades, valvular heart disease (n=64); in other
shades, congenital heart disease (n=71).

high-risk period because of cardiac stress due to pain and
anxiety as well as fluid overload.11 While peripartum cardio￾myopathy by definition occurs in the months around delivery,
patients with VHD are reported to present with HF during
pregnancy as well as in the peripartum period.7
–10 In our
study, there appeared to be two peaks, one at the end of the
second and beginning of the third trimester, and the other
around delivery. Within this pattern, there were distinct clusters
of diagnostic groups. Women with abnormalities causing pul￾monary hypertension, such as shunt lesions and mitral stenosis,
typically went into HF before 30 weeks gestation. In those
with most forms of cardiomyopathy, HF was diagnosed peri￾partum. The first peak, corresponding to 23–30 weeks
occurred when most of the important haemodynamic changes
had taken place. Stroke volume then has reached its maximum
(up to 130% of normal) for a number of weeks, but heart rate
is just starting to increase. The second peak occurred around
delivery, corresponding with peripartum haemodynamic
changes. Peripartum cardiac output increases with an additional
25%, and after delivery, autotransfusion from the uterus will
further increase circulatory volume thereby stressing both the
left and RV. Firm conclusions for all diagnostic groups cannot
be made, some of the diagnostic groups were small.
Pregnancy outcome in patients with HF
Pre-eclampsia during pregnancy was associated with HF with an
OR of 7.1. In previously healthy women who develop pre￾eclampsia, diastolic and systolic left ventricular function abnor￾malities have been demonstrated, but these rarely develop into
HF.35 However, in women with pre-existing heart disease, the
added strain of pre-eclampsia precipitates HF resulting in a rate
as high as 30% of the patients. This is an important novel
finding of our study, which indicates that patients with heart
disease who develop pre-eclampsia should be monitored care￾fully for the development of HF. One-third of the HF associated
with pre-eclampsia was in patients with peripartum cardiomyop￾athy, which is a known association.35 36 However, two-thirds of
the HF occurring in patients with pre-eclampsia occurred in
patients with other underlying diseases. HF was also associated
with endocarditis, which likely was a cause of HF. Caesarean
section rates were high in patients with HF, with the majority
having a CS for cardiac reasons. Women with HF were often
delivered preterm probably to shorten the period of volume
load and to be able to institute more aggressive therapy for the
treatment of HF, however, the decision for early delivery may
have a negative impact on the offspring in the longer term.37

retardation occurred more often in patients with HF, which may
keenly illustrate the difficult balance between early delivery and
prolonging pregnancy in this high-risk situation. Reassuringly,
neonatal death rates were not different.
Limitations
Some of the parameters previously described in the literature
were not collected in this database, such as the severity of left
ventricular outflow tract obstruction (peak aortic gradient
>50 mm Hg or aortic valve area <1.0 cm2
). Therefore, we could
neither confirm nor contradict the value of these previously iden￾tified predictors. Echocardiographic and laboratory data (such as
right ventricular systolic pressure) were not available in a major￾ity of the patients and, therefore, could not be involved in the
multivariable analysis. As with other international registries, the
input and quality of data was checked in only 5–10% of cases.
Additionally, some centres had much higher volumes than others.
Since our dataset had limitations, necessarily some of the defini￾tions (such as pulmonary hypertension) deviated from current
guidelines, therefore, all data and comments on this matter must
be seen in this perspective. We did not collect detailed
information on the severity of HF, although we do know that all
patients needed treatment. Details on type of treatment and
length of hospital stay could, however, not be analysed.
Importantly, the use of predictors has limitations in estimating
the risk of pregnancy in individual patients. Always, predictors
identified in multiple studies must be taken into account together
with the results of disease-specific studies. Although we showed
that timing of HF was dependent on underlying heart disease,
some of the subgroups were small. Consequently, our findings
need to be confirmed in future large studies. As with all registries,
there was some missing information, this was about 4%.
CONCLUSION
HF was the most common complication in this pregnancy regis￾try. Timing of HF was dependant on the underlying cardiac
diagnosis, with HF in the second trimester occurring mainly in
patients with shunt lesions or VHD. By contrast, patients with
cardiomyopathy and IHD developed HF shortly after delivery.
In addition to the previously recognised risk factors such as pre￾pregnancy signs of HF, high NYHA class or WHO category ≥3,
we discovered new predictors for HF: cardiomyopathy or

Key messages
What is already known about this subject
Heart failure is one of the most important complications in
pregnant women with heart disease, causing maternal and fetal
mortality and morbidity.
What this study adds
Heart failure was the most common complication in pregnant
women with underlying heart disease. Women with signs of
heart failure prior to pregnancy, NYHA ≥3, WHO ≥3,
cardiomyopathy or pulmonary hypertension are especially at
risk. In our study, there appeared to be two peaks for onset of
heart failure: the first peak at the end of the second and
beginning of the third trimester, and the second peak around
delivery. Women with heart disease who develop pre-eclampsia,
have a risk of 30% to develop heart failure during their
pregnancy.
