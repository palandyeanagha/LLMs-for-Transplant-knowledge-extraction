Abstract
Background: Bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) is a rare but severe disease in children. Currently, there is no consensus
on the treatment for BO with respect to the systemic use of corticosteroids. Here we report on the follow-up of
children with a diagnosis of BO who were treated with corticosteroid pulse therapy.
Methods: Forty patients fulfilling the BO diagnosis criteria were treated with methylprednisolone pulse therapy in
monthly cycles until clinical improvement. After the pulse therapy began, we analyzed the clinical and laboratory
data at intervals. Statistical analyses were performed using non-parametric tests to compare repeated measures
(Friedman, Wilcoxon) or paired nominal data (McNemar) (α = 5%).
Results: The frequency of wheezing exacerbations and hospitalizations was reduced (p = 0.0042 and p < 0.0001,
respectively) and oxygen saturation improved (p = 0.0002) in the pulse therapy-treated patients. Prolonged oral
corticosteroid therapy was discontinued in 83% of these patients. The mean Z-score length for age improved from
-1.08 to -0.63, and the mean Z-score weight for age improved from -0.91 to -0.59. The adverse effects during the
infusion were temporary and none were serious.
Conclusions: Our data suggest that pulse corticotherapy could be a safe alternative to prolonged systemic oral
corticotherapy in children with BO, thus minimizing the adverse effects of the oral therapy. New prospective
controlled studies are required to confirm this proposition.

Background
Bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) is a rare form of chronic
obstructive lung disease that follows an infection-induced
injury to the lower respiratory tract. This condition results
in partial or complete obliteration of the small airways
[1-3]. Although the first description of clinical cases of
bronchiolitis obliterans is credited to Lange in 1901, many
aspects of this disease remain unknown [4-6].
Bronchiolitis obliterans is an uncommon disease, but a
growing number of reports in recent decades have resulted
in a greater awareness of the condition [2,3]. Although
there are no worldwide studies of the prevalence of post￾infectious BO, it has mainly been reported in the southern
hemisphere (Argentina, Chile, southern Brazil, Australia
and New Zealand) [1,2,7].
No universally accepted protocol has been established
for the treatment of BO [6,8]. Corticosteroid therapy seeks
to modify the fibroblastic response in the early phase of
illness. This approach is based on a study conducted in
1958 in which steroids were administered to rabbits to
prevent development of BO [9]. Others studies have
reported variable efficacy of corticosteroid therapy in
patients with BO [1,5,10].
Methylprednisolone intravenous pulse therapy has
been proposed to enhance the therapeutic effects and
reduce the side effects of corticotherapy, and it is an
alternative treatment for patients with more severe disease

[1,7,10]. The aim of the present study was to review the
clinical, laboratory and radiological data collected before
and after treatment from patients with bronchiolitis oblit￾erans who were treated with methylprednisolone pulse
therapy.
Methods
Forty children of both genders aged 5 months to 13 years
and diagnosed with BO were followed up retrospectively
at the Pediatric Pulmonology Unit of the Instituto da
Criança, Hospital das Clínicas, University of São Paulo.
The diagnosis of BO was made according to clinical cri￾teria (acute lower respiratory tract infection associated
with persistent obstructive respiratory disease after the ini￾tial event, which was not responsive to treatment for a
period longer than 6 weeks), the results of high resolution
computerized tomography of the thorax (mosaic pattern
and/or bronchiectasis) and in some patients, with lung bi￾opsies (obliterative bronchiolitis). Other causes of chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, including cystic fibrosis,
bronchopulmonary dysplasia, pulmonary tuberculosis,
α1-antitrypsin deficiency, immunodeficiencies, aspiration
of foreign bodies and cardiac diseases, were excluded.
The cases included all patients who received at least
six cycles of treatment with intravenous corticosteroid
pulse therapy (methylprednisolone 30 mg/kg/BW per
day for three days) from 1996 to 2007. The criteria for
beginning corticosteroid pulse therapy in the patients
with BO was the severity of the condition as indicated
by difficulty in the removal of the prolonged oral corti￾costeroids and/or hypoxemia requiring home oxygen
therapy.
This pulse regimen (30 mg/kg/day for 3 days) is
already used in other childhood diseases such as renal
and rheumatologic diseases [11-15]. The corticosteroid
dose of 10 mg/kg/day is classically used in restrictive
interstitial lung diseases, but we chose the 30 mg/kg/day
dose due to the clinical severity of the disease in our
patients. Recently, the 30 mg/kg/day pulse regimen has
also been used in children with pneumonia caused by
Mycoplasma pneumoniae [16].
The initial cycles of pulse therapy were repeated on a
monthly basis. As clinical improvement was demonstra￾ted, the cycle interval was increased to two months, and
pulse therapy was later discontinued. All of the clinical
and radiological data regarding the patients’ medical his￾tories, such as duration of gestation, breast feeding, paren￾tal smoking and family history of asthma, were obtained
from previous medical records.
Statistical analysis
Clinical and laboratory data were analyzed at intervals
after the pulse therapy began, and non-parametric statis￾tical tests were used to compare repeated measures
(Friedman, Wilcoxon) or paired nominal data (McNemar).
A Dunn post-test with statistical significance defined
as α = 5% was performed for multiple comparisons.
Ethical approval
The ethics committee for analysis of clinical research pro￾jects of Hospital das Clinicas - University of São Paulo
(CAPpesq) approved this research, protocol number
0695/07.
Results
Characteristics of the patients
Table 1 shows the characteristics and history of the 40
patients. Our study sample consisted of 30 (75%) boys
and 10 (25%) girls, ranging in age (at diagnosis) from 5
months to 13 years. At diagnosis, the time elapsed since
the episode of acute illness was between 1 and 134 months
(mean 24.6 months, median 12.5 months). The average
number of previous hospitalizations was 4 per year.
Twenty-one patients (52.5%) required mechanical ventila￾tion during a previous hospitalization, and 8 (20%) needed
domiciliary oxygen therapy.
Table 2 shows that the most common symptoms and
signs of the 40 patients diagnosed with BO were wheez￾ing, dyspnea and cough.
Table 3 shows that the most frequent findings of the
chest HRCT were a mosaic perfusion pattern and bron￾chial wall thickening.
Etiology
The presumed etiology was post-infectious in 37 pa￾tients. Because viral identification for the acute bron￾chiolitis was not performed in all patients referred to the
hospital, viral identification by paired serology was only
available for 5 patients: 2 with adenovirus, 1 with respi￾ratory syncytial virus (RSV), and 2 with adenovirus plus
RSV. The other 32 patients had typical histories of previ￾ous severe acute bronchiolitis (most with hospitalization
and even requiring mechanical ventilation) and after this
event, the airway obstruction persisted for a period longer
than 6 weeks. On this basis, these patients were consid￾ered to have post-infectious BO.
Two patients had histopathological findings consistent
with obliterative bronchiolitis and indicative of aspiration
syndrome. One patient had a history of acute viral bron￾chiolitis with persistence of airway obstruction and severe
gastro-esophageal reflux. For this patient, we considered
that viral infection and aspiration could be both associated
with the etiology.
Pathologic findings
Open lung biopsies were performed in 18 patients. In 14
of these, the pathologic findings were consistent with
obliterative bronchiolitis. The histological patterns were:

constrictive in 13 patients; proliferative in 1 patient; and
inconclusive in 4 patients.
Lung function measurements
Most patients did not perform a lung function test
because they were under 6 years of age. Spirometry,
including a bronchodilator response test, was performed
in only 8 patients (ages 6-14, mean age 9.6 years). The
means of the initial spirometry parameters, expressed as
percentages of the predicted values, were: FVC: 77.2%;
FEV1: 55.3%; FEV1/FVC: 67.4% and FEF25-75%: 35.7%.
Three patients responded significantly to bronchodilation
according to criteria from the American Thoracic Society
and the European Respiratory Society [17].
Because patient follow-up was performed for many
years, the first spirometry results were available for 24
patients (age 6-8 years, mean 7.2 years) after pulse ther￾apy (mean time 27 months), with parameter means as
follows: FVC: 66.8%; FEV1: 47.7%; FEV1/FVC: 65.6% and
FEF25-75%: 26.6%. Five of these patients had a response
to bronchodilation according the American Thoracic
Society and the European Respiratory Society criteria [17].
Follow-up
Clinical follow-up
The patients were followed for an average of 51.6
months (ranging from 23 to 93 months), and 24 patients
are still being observed (Table 4). The total number of
treatment cycles with pulse therapy ranged from 6 to 40
(mean 20.2, median 18.5).

In addition to the systemic corticosteroid therapy, all
40 patients received inhaled corticosteroids to reduce
airway hyperreactivity for the entire follow-up period.
Other medications used by the patients during the pulse
therapy period included: long-term beta-2-agonist bron￾chodilators in 23 patients (57.5%); anti-gastroesophageal
reflux drugs in 23 (57.5%); antibiotic prophylaxis in 19
(47.5%); anti-hypertensive drugs in 21 (52.5%); digoxin
in 2 (5%); and diuretics in 13 (32.5%).
Development
The clinical data were analyzed at intervals before and
after pulse therapy began (every 6 months, before and
after therapy). The frequency of the wheezing exacerba￾tions (Figure 1a) was significantly reduced after 24 months
of pulse therapy relative to the baseline (6 months before
therapy) (p = 0.0042). The frequency of hospitalization
after 18 months of pulse therapy (Figure 1b) was signifi￾cantly reduced compared to the baseline (6 months before
therapy) (p < 0.0001).
The initial transcutaneous oxygen saturation measure￾ments (Figure 1c and d) showed hypoxemia (<95%) in
29 patients (n = 35). The level of oxygen saturation impro￾ved compared to the baseline in the first (p = 0.0002) and
second years (p = 0.0005) following pulse therapy.
The mean length-for-age Z-score (Figure 2a) improved
compared to the baseline and after the end of pulse ther￾apy, from -1.08 to -0.63 (p = 0.015). The mean weight-for￾age Z-score (Figure 2b) was also improved at the end of
pulse therapy compared to the baseline: from -0.91 to -0.59
(p = 0.039).
Spirometry was performed in 8 patients before pulse
therapy. Only 5 patients repeated the exam after 1 year
of treatment. The mean of the spirometric results 1 year
before and 1 year after treatment were, respectively: FVC:
72.6%/78.9%; FEV1: 48.8%/52.6%; FEV1/CVF: 62.5%/63%
and FEF25-75%: 24.2%/22.9%. Only an evaluation of the
means is presented because it was not possible to perform
a statistical analysis due the small number of patients.

During follow-up, chest tomography was repeated in
37 patients, and the initial abnormalities, such as bronchi￾ectasis, bronchial wall thickening and mosaic perfusion
patterns, remained in all of these patients. Normalization
of tomographic alterations was not achieved during the
follow-up period.
Before pulse therapy, 23 patients received continuous
oral corticosteroid therapy. However, 24 months after
starting pulse therapy, 19 patients (83%) were able to
discontinue the oral corticosteroids at an average of 12.4
months (Table 5). The difference between the frequency
of use of oral corticosteroids before and 24 months after
pulse therapy is statistically significant (McNemar test,
p <0.001).
Prior to pulse therapy, 20 patients required supplemen￾tal oxygen therapy due to low oxygen saturation levels on
room air and/or cor pulmonale (Table 5). The hypoxemia
improved during follow up, and as a result, twenty-four
months after starting the pulse therapy, the administration
of oxygen therapy was totally discontinued in 5 patients
(25%), while oxygen therapy was modified from full-time
to overnight-only in another 5 patients (25%). The differ￾ence between the frequency of use of oxygen before and
24 months after pulse therapy is statistically significant
(McNemar, p <0.029).
Echocardiograms showed evidence of pulmonary hyper￾tension - mean pulmonary artery pressure above 25
mmHg at rest or above 30 mmHg in exercise, or systolic
pulmonary artery pressure above 30 mmHg at rest or
above 35 mmHg in exercise [18] - in 27 patients before
pulse therapy. All patients with abnormal echocardio￾grams were referred to the Pediatric Cardiology Unit for
evaluation. The cardiologist performed a physical exam
with echocardiography and electrocardiography. Twenty￾four months after starting pulse therapy, the cor pul￾monale abnormalities disappeared in 12 patients (Table 5).
The difference between the frequency of pulmonary
hypertension before and 24 months after pulse therapy is
statistically significant (McNemar, p <0.001).
Comparison of patients with and without prolonged oral
corticosteroids
Because 23 patients were already on continuous oral cor￾ticosteroid therapy at the beginning of the pulse therapy
treatment and 17 were not, we compared the outcomes of
the two groups.
Survival curves to compare the pulse duration of the
patients who were on prolonged oral corticosteroid ther￾apy and of the patients who were not given this therapy
were produced (Figure 3a). The difference between the
curves resulted not statistically significant (Log-rank test,
p = 0.297).
Analysis of the frequency of wheezing exacerbations
and hospitalizations showed a decrease in the number of
hospitalizations in the group with prolonged oral cor￾ticosteroid therapy after pulse therapy compared to
the baseline (6 months before therapy) (p < 0.001)
(Figure 3b). Furthermore, the median number of hos￾pitalizations before pulse therapy differed from the
medians at all other times (6, 12, 18 and 24 months).
However, no statistically significant differences among the
median numbers of exacerbations were found (p = 0.127)
(Figure 3c).

After pulse therapy, the group without prolonged
oral corticosteroid therapy had a decrease in the
number of exacerbations when compared to the baseline
(6 month before therapy) (p < 0.031) (Figure 3e). Add￾itionally, the median number of exacerbations before
pulse therapy differed from the medians at all other
times (6, 12, 18 and 24 months). However, no sta￾tistically significant differences among the median
numbers of hospitalizations were found (p = 0.144)
(Figure 3d).
Adverse effects
Adverse effects during the infusion
All of the adverse effects during methylprednisolone
intravenous infusion were temporary (Table 6). The
most common adverse effect was hyperglycemia (9.1% of

cycles), but none of these patients developed diabetes
mellitus. Of the 19 episodes of acute hypertension, 10
occurred in patients with a prior diagnosis of systemic
hypertension.
Adverse effects of prolonged corticosteroid therapy
Bone mineral density was measured in 25 patients. The
results were normal in 13, abnormal in 11 and border￾line in 1 case. The patients who were considered to be
abnormal or borderline were referred to the pediatric
rheumatology unit, where 8 were diagnosed with osteo￾porosis (1 with hypophosphataemic rickets and salt-losing
tubulopathy) and 4 were treated with alendronate.
Fundoscopy examinations were performed in 28 pa￾tients, and the results were abnormal in 4. Two presented
systemic-hypertension-related lesions, 1 presented with a
toxoplasmosis scar and 1 developed a cataract 1 year after
the termination of pulse therapy. Urinary tract ultra￾sounds were performed in 37 patients and were found to
be abnormal in 7 patients. Two presented with nephro￾lithiasis, 4 with nephrocalcinosis and 1 with a small pyelo￾caliceal dilatation.
None of the patients were diagnosed with diabetes
mellitus. Three were referred to the pediatric endocrin￾ology unit due to multiple hyperglycemic episodes. Each
of these patients had normal levels of fasting plasma
glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin.
Sixteen patients were diagnosed with systemic hyper￾tension, but 9 of these were diagnosed before beginning
pulse therapy.
Discussion
Bronchiolitis obliterans has a number of causes, includ￾ing connective tissue disorders, occupational inhalation
injuries, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, drugs, radiation,
Stevens-Johnson syndrome and lung, heart/lung or bone
marrow transplantation [1,3,4].
In childhood, BO occurs most commonly after a severe
lower respiratory tract infection and is considered a long￾term sequela of viral infections [1,5,19]. Several agents
have been associated with the development of post￾infectious BO, such as adenovirus (types 3, 7 and 21),
respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza, parainfluenza,
measles and Mycoplasma pneumoniae [5,10,20]. Adeno￾virus infection and the severity of acute illness (hospital
days, intensive care unit admission, mechanical
ventilation, oxygen use, corticosteroid treatment and β2-
agonist administration) are the most significant risk fac￾tors for developing post-infectious BO in children
[2,19,21]. This is consistent with our study, in which the
presumed etiology was post-infectious in 37 patients,
based on histories of prior infection and/or positive viral
serology findings.
The diagnosis of BO was based on clinical criteria,
findings on HRTC scans and/or open lung biopsies
[7,10,22-25]. Although lung biopsy is the gold standard
for diagnosis, the sensitivity is low due to the heteroge￾neous distribution of airway involvement throughout the
lung parenchyma [1,3,10]. Lung biopsies are not usually
needed when clinical conditions suggestive of post-infec￾tious BO and specific HRCT scan abnormalities (mosaic
perfusion, bronchiectasis) are present, once other possible
causes of chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases have
been excluded [1,7,22-24]. All 37 post-infectious BO pa￾tients in our study had histories of obstruction of the
airways that persisted over 6 weeks after the initial event
and had suggestive CT scans. Other diseases were exclu￾ded. Fourteen patients had open lung biopsies with patho￾logic findings consistent with obliterative bronchiolitis
(2 with signs of aspiration).
Mauad et al. [26] studied the histopathological features
of 34 pediatric patients with a diagnosis of BO and
showed that childhood bronchiolitis obliterans is histo￾logically characterized mainly by a constrictive pattern
(97%), which is in agreement with the findings in our
sample (13 constrictive patterns from 18 biopsies).
Pulmonary function tests in children with post-infec￾tious BO typically show severe airway obstruction with
small responses to bronchodilation, increased resistance,
normal or increased total lung capacity (TLC) and ele￾vated residual volume (RV) due to hyperinflation and
air trapping [1,10,23,24]. In our study, all of the tested
subjects had patterns of pulmonary function charac￾terized by mild to severe obstruction and significantly
diminished FEV1.
There is no consensus on to the optimal treatment for
BO [6,8]. General supportive measures include avoidance
of tobacco smoke and other inhaled irritants, the use of
influenza vaccination, chest physiotherapy, adequate nu￾tritional intake and the administration of supplemental
oxygen for hypoxemic patients [1,10].
Although systemic corticosteroids are frequently used,
their effectiveness in improving the outcomes for patients
with BO, as well as the best route of administration, is
controversial [1,23]. Some clinicians opt for the systemic
use of corticosteroids rather than delivery by inhalation
because the obliterative lesions in the small airways can
interfere with the deposition of aerosol [8,23,25]. Others
prefer inhaled corticosteroids to minimize the adverse sys￾temic effects and to reduce airway hyperreactivity [6,19].

The advantages of intravenous pulse therapy are the
enhancement of the therapeutic effect and reduction of
the side effects caused by the intermittent administration
of high doses of drugs [27-29]. Corticosteroid pulse ther￾apy is arbitrarily defined as more than 250 mg prednis￾one or its equivalent per day [29]. The first reported use
of a high-dose intravenous corticosteroid was in 1969,
when it was used to successfully prevent renal allograft
rejection [29]. Since then, high-dose intravenous cortico￾steroids have come to be used in a variety of inflamma￾tory conditions [27-30].
In the field of pulmonology, pulse therapy has been
effective in the treatment of other inflammatory lung
diseases, such as chronic interstitial lung diseases [31,32].
There are limited reports of its use in patients with post￾infectious BO [8]. Recently, it has been administered to
pediatric patients with post-transplant BO. Ratjen et al.
[33] studied nine children who were treated with pulse
methylprednisolone therapy after being diagnosed with
BO subsequent to bone marrow transplantation. The oxy￾gen saturation in all of these individuals increased signifi￾cantly and was normalized at the end of therapy. In 5 of
the 9 patients, the treatment led to stabilization of the
lung function without further deterioration during the
follow-up period, but normalization of the pulmonary
function was not achieved.
In our study, the children with BO who were treated
with the high-dose methylprednisolone pulse therapy
displayed clinical improvements as demonstrated by
decreased wheezing exacerbations and improved oxygen
saturation. The numbers of hospitalizations were reduced
as a consequence. These data suggest that this therapy
may be a valuable treatment option for children with BO.
Twenty-four months after the beginning of the pulse
therapy, 83% of patients who received prolonged oral
corticosteroid therapy were able to stop this prolonged
therapy. Twenty-five percent of hypoxemic patients com￾pletely discontinued supplemental oxygen therapy, and in
another 25% of patients, oxygen therapy was modified
from full-time administration to overnight-only. Approxi￾mately 52% of the patients with evidence of pulmonary
hypertension by echocardiogram exhibited normalization
following the pulse therapy. In our opinion, the most
important reason for recommending pulse therapy in
patients with BO should be a dependence on oral cor￾ticosteroid therapy and a need for domiciliary oxygen
therapy.
Comparing patients with and without prolonged oral
corticosteroid therapy, we found that the difference in
pulse therapy duration was not significantly different.
The group with oral corticosteroids had a decrease in
the number of hospitalizations but not of exacer￾bations, indicating that the exacerbation severity was
reduced but not the frequency. The group without
oral corticosteroids had a decrease in the number of
exacerbations but not hospitalizations. The median
hospitalization before the pulse therapy was already
zero, indicating that exacerbations were less severe in
this group.
With regards to safety, the toxicity of corticosteroids is
manifested mainly by disturbances in electrolytes, sup￾pressed growth, loss of bone mass, cushingoid appear￾ance, gastrointestinal bleeding, neural complications,
metabolic toxicity, renal complications, cardiac toxicity,
ophthalmic problems and damage to the immunological
system, which result in an increased susceptibility to
infections [27-30,34,35]. In patients with normal kidney
function, the renal effects of pulse therapy seem to be
minimal. However, in nephritic patients they can lead to
renal deterioration [36].
In our sample, all the acute effects during the methyl￾prednisolone intravenous infusion were transient, and
none were serious. Hyperglycemia occurred in 9% of
cycles, hypernatremia in 1.7% and acute hypertension
in 2.3%.
In our study, 8 patients presented with osteoporosis
(1 had hypophosphatemic rachitis with phosphorus￾losing tubulopathy), 1 developed a cataract one year after
pulse therapy, 7 had abnormal urinary tract ultrasounds
(2 cases of nephrolithiasis, 4 cases of nephrocalcinosis
and 1 case of small pyelocaliceal dilatation), and 16
presented with systemic hypertension (9 of whom exhi￾bited this condition prior to pulse therapy). None of the
patients were diagnosed with diabetes mellitus.
Nevertheless, the adverse effects of corticosteroids are
dose and time-dependent, so it is impossible to discrimin￾ate between prolonged corticosteroid therapy side effects
due to pulse therapy and/or those due to any oral cortico￾steroid that the patients received for wheezing exacerba￾tions. It is important to note that 23 patients were already
on continuous oral corticosteroid therapy at the beginning
of this treatment.
There is a general concern regarding the effect of cor￾ticosteroids in pediatric patients. However, in our study,
the pulse therapy did not appear to have interfered with
growth. Indeed, we observed improvements in height
and weight, possibly because of the clinical stabilization.
After pulse therapy, the mean Z-score of length by age
improved from -1.08 to -0.63 and the mean Z-score of
weight by age improved from -0.91 to -0.59.
As far as we know, this is the largest series of pediatric
BO patients treated with methylprednisolone pulse ther￾apy that has been reported to date. However, we are
aware that the present study has a number of limitations.
First, this study did not include a control group and there￾fore cannot definitively prove that treatment altered the
natural course of the disease. Additionally, it is well
known that the small airways are disproportionately

narrow in the early years of life. However, lung growth
increases peripheral airway conduction, which reduces
airway resistance. The airways consequently become less
vulnerable to obstruction [23]. Therefore, the clinical im￾provement observed in our sample of patients may be due
to the physical increase in the sizes of the peripheral air￾ways, which is the consequence of normal lung growth
and does not necessarily represent regression of the path￾ology [19,23]. Finally, our cohort was relatively small
because of the low frequency of this disease in pediatric
patients. A multicenter approach would be needed to
sample a larger patient cohort.
In contrast to the high mortality rate for post￾transplantation BO (25-56%) [4,37,38], post-infectious BO
tends to show clinical improvement after 2-3 years of
supportive therapy, although clinical, radiological and
spirometric changes might persist [8,19,23-25]. As shown
in a study by Zhang et al. [23] of 31 patients with post￾infectious BO, clinical remission was found in 22.6% of
the patients, 67.7% had persistent respiratory signs and
symptoms, and 9.7% of the patients died. In another study
of 20 post-infectious BO patients [25], no improve￾ment was evident in 40% of patients, 55% had partial
remission of symptoms, 5% died of the disease and
none recovered completely after 3 years of follow-up.
In a Brazilian study of 48 patients with post-infectious BO
[39], there was partial clinical improvement in 65% of
patients, but 35% had no improvement at all after 3 years
of follow-up.
However, the most worrisome results were found in
the study by Cazzato et al. [40]. In this study, eleven
patients with post-infectious BO were followed up for a
mean period of 10.2 years, and FEV1 and FEF25-75% fell
at rates of -1.01% and -1.04% per year, respectively.
These results suggest that childhood post-infectious BO
can be a progressive lung disorder with increasing lung
function impairment. Consequently, patients may need
an anti-inflammatory treatment to prevent the progres￾sion of the lesions.
Conclusions
In conclusion, our results suggest that intravenous
methylprednisolone pulse therapy appears to be useful
and fairly safe in pediatric patients with bronchiolitis oblit￾erans. This treatment can modify the progress of the
disease and may be an alternative option for administering
systemic corticosteroids and thereby avoiding the side
effects associated with continuous oral corticotherapy.
Further prospective controlled studies are necessary to
confirm these findings.
