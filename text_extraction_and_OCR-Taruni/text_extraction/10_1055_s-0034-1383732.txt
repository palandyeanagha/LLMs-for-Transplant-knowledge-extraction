Summary (140 words)
Anti-mitochondrial, anti-gp210, anti-sp100, and anti-centromere 
antibodies are specifically detected in PBC. In clinical practice, they are useful for the 
diagnosis of PBC or for evaluating disease severity, clinical phenotype, and long-term 
outcome. In the typical or classical form of PBC which shows slow progressive loss of 
small bile ducts with a parallel increase in liver fibrosis, anti-gp210 antibodies are a 
strong risk factor for progression to jaundice and hepatic failure, while the presence of
anti-centromere antibodies is a risk factor for progression to cirrhosis and portal 
1

hypertension. Of note, the autoimmune repertoire, which is established during the early 
stage of the disease process, can influence the clinical phenotype and the long-term 
prognosis of PBC. Since the natural course of PBC is being altered by treatment with 
ursodeoxycholic acid, the clinical significance of these PBC-specific autoantibodies 
awaits re-evaluation in various ethnicities.

Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC)
I. Introduction
Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is a chronic, progressive cholestatic autoimmune 
liver disease characterized by destruction of intrahepatic bile ducts, portal hypertension, 
and development of cirrhosis and hepatic failure [1]. Although the prognosis of PBC has 
improved markedly since the introduction of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), disease 
2

progression remains highly variable. Approximately 10 to 20% of patients do not 
respond to treatment and eventually progress to end-stage hepatic failure [2,3,4]. 
More than 60 distinct autoantibodies have been identified in PBC [5-9]. 
Some of them are specific to PBC and are useful not only for the diagnosis of PBC, but 
also for the assessment of disease severity, clinical phenotype, and long-term prognosis 
(Table 1) [5-11]. Some autoantibodies are specific for concomitant autoimmune 
diseases such as Sjogren’s syndrome, chronic thyroiditis, systemic sclerosis (SSc), and 
autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) [5-7]. Other autoantibodies seem to be less important in 
clinical practice because of their low specificity or low sensitivity [6,7,8].
In the present review article, we focus on several PBC-specific 
autoantibodies, including anti-mitochondrial antibodies (AMAs) and anti-nuclear 
antibodies (ANAs) in a nuclear envelope (NE) staining pattern, multiple nuclear dot 
(MND) pattern, and centromere pattern (CENP) (Table 1 and Figure 1). We discuss 
their clinical significance in association with disease phenotype and long-term outcome 
[12]. 
II. Anti-mitochondrial antibodies (AMAs)
AMAs are highly PBC-specific autoantibodies that have been detected in 
3

more than 90% of PBC patients but less than 1% of normal controls (Table 1 and 
Figure 1A, 1B) [5,6,7]. AMA-positivity constitutes one of the three major diagnostic 
criteria for PBC [2,3,4]. 
The autoantigens targeted by AMAs consist of E2 components of the
2-oxoacid dehydrogenase family of enzyme complexes (2-OACD), including pyruvate 
dehydrogenase complex (PDC-E2), branched chain 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase complex 
(BCOADC-E2), 2-oxo-glutarate dehydrogenase complex (OGDC-E2), the E1α subunit 
of PDC, and E3 binding protein (protein X) [7,13-16]. These enzymes are located on the 
inner mitochondrial membrane and catalyze the oxidative decarboxylation of keto-acid 
substrates [7]. In PBC, PDC-E2 is the primary autoantigen to which more than 90% of
the antibodies in the patient’s serum react [7]. In addition, approximately 50–80% of 
PBC patients have serum that reacts to BCOADC-E2, 20–60% react to OGDC-E2, 
5–25% react to E1α, and 10% react to E3 binding protein (Table 1) [13-16].
Various methods have been used for detecting AMAs, including IIF
using sections of rat kidney, stomach, or liver or HEp-2 cells, as well as immunoblotting
using purified or recombinant mitochondrial antigens [17-20]. To increase the 
sensitivity of AMA detection, sensitive ELISA systems have been developed using M2 
antigens (recombinant PDC-E2), M3 antigens (recombinant proteins co-expressing the 
4

immunodominant epitopes of PDC-E2, BCOADC-E2, and OACD-E2), and a sensitive 
bead assay [17,18,19]. With advances in the methods for detecting AMAs, the
proportion of AMA-negative PBC patients has dropped below 5%. Furthermore, 
approximately half of AMA-negative PBC patients are positive for at least one of the
three PBC-specific ANAs, either anti-gp210, anti-SP100, or anti-promyelocytic 
leukemia (PML) antibodies [20,21,22].
The prevalence of AMAs in the first-degree relatives of PBC probands is 
as high as 13.1%, whereas the prevalence is only 1% in controls matched by gender, age, 
race, and residence, suggesting that environmental and genetic risk factors are involved 
in the pathogenesis of AMA production [23]. In addition, AMAs are detected in the 
serum years before clinical manifestations or biochemical abnormalities, indicating that 
the immune response to mitochondrial antigens has been initiated before clinical 
manifestations of PBC develop [24,25]. Although the characteristics of AMAs found in 
healthy subjects may differ from those found in PBC patients [26], AMA positivity in 
healthy subjects is potentially a risk factor for future development of PBC [24,25].
AMA titers do not change over time and are not associated with disease 
severity or progression [27,28]. The clinical course of AMA-positive and 
AMA-negative PBC patients are similar [29,30,31]. These findings suggest that AMA is 
5

not useful for monitoring the severity or progression of PBC. On the other hand, there 
have been some reports indicating some differences between AMA-positive and 
AMA-negative PBC patients [32-34]. A large Japanese retrospective database study 
suggested that pruritus is less frequently observed in AMA-negative patients as 
compared to AMA-positive patients [33]. Levels of ALP and IgM were also 
significantly lower in patients in the AMA-negative group as compared to the 
AMA-positive group. The degree of bile duct damage around the portal area was 
significantly milder in the AMA-positive group [34]. 
In addition, Poupon et al reported that AMA titers decrease with 
treatment with UDCA [35]. We recently observed several cases of early-stage PBC in 
which AMA titers became negative after treatment with UDCA, indicating the presence 
of immunological complete remission after UDCA therapy (unpublished data). Further 
prospective studies are needed to clarify the clinical significance of AMA levels over
time with UDCA or bezafibrate therapy and to determine whether immunological 
complete remission can be achieved with treatment during an early stage of the disease, 
especially in AMA-positive subjects without any biochemical abnormalities. 
III. Anti-nuclear antibodies (ANAs)
6

ANAs are detected by IIF in 30–50% of PBC patients [5,6,8,9,36,37]. 
ANAs detected by IIF using HEp-2 cells show various staining patterns, depending on 
the corresponding nuclear antigens (Figure 1 and Table 1) [8,36,37]. These antigens 
include components of (1) the NE pore complex (gp210 and p62), which correspond to 
a dotted NE or rim-like/membranous pattern (Figure 1C); (2) lamin A, B, C, and lamin 
B receptor, which correspond to a smooth NE pattern (Figure 1F); (3) sp100, PML 
proteins, sp140, and small ubiquitin-related modifiers (SUMOs), which correspond to a 
multiple nuclear dot (MND) pattern (Figure 1D); and (4) centromere A, B, and C
proteins, which correspond to a centromere (CENP) pattern (Figure 1E) [8,37].
1: Anti-gp210 antibodies
Gp210 is an integral glycoprotein of the nuclear pore complex consisting of 
three main domains: a large glycosylated luminal domain, a single hydrophobic 
transmembrane segment, and a short cytoplasmic tail [38,39]. The main gp210 epitope 
recognized by anti-gp210 autoantibodies is a 15 amino acid stretch in the cytoplasmic, 
carboxyl-terminal domain of the protein, which is widely used for the detection of 
anti-gp210 antibodies in ELISAs [39,40,41]. Antibodies to gp210 are highly specific for 
PBC and are detected in 20–40% of PBC patients [39,40,41]. Itoh et al were the first to 
7

report an association between anti-gp210 antibodies and disease severity in 1998 [42].
Subsequently, the clinical significance of anti-gp210 antibodies and antibodies to 
nuclear pore complexes in general has been described by several investigators [43-48]. 
Nakamura et al made serial ELISA measurements of serum levels of
antibodies to the terminal peptide of gp210-C 1863–1887
(PTSPNALPPARKASPPSGLWSPAYASH) in a large Japanese cohort of PBC patients
[41,48,49]. Results obtained so far indicate that (1) serum titers of anti-gp210 antibodies 
change from negative to positive or vice versa depending on disease activity or stage 
progression; (2) anti-gp210 antibody positivity is associated histologically with more 
severe interface hepatitis, lobular inflammation, and ductular reaction; (3) persistently 
positive anti-gp210 antibodies are a strong risk factor for progression to end-stage 
hepatic failure (jaundice-type progression); and (4) the prognosis is most favorable in 
PBC patients who were initially seropositive for anti-gp210 antibodies but became 
negative after UDCA treatment. A good immunological response, as determined by 
anti-gp210 antibody levels, is the most significant protective factor associated with
disease progression, in addition to other recently well described protective factors based 
on a good biochemical response to UDCA treatment [50,51,52]. A significant 
association between anti-gp210 antibody status and severity or progression of PBC has 
8

been supported by other recent cohort studies in Japan and China [22,53]. Since UDCA
therapy was introduced into clinical practice for PBC, the natural course of PBC has 
changed dramatically in patients who are positive and negative for anti-gp210 
antibodies. However, anti-gp210 antibody positivity remains the strongest risk factor for 
progression to hepatic failure in PBC patients in the latest Japanese cohort study [54]. 
To better understand the clinical significance of anti-gp210 antibodies, further study is 
needed in association with other factors that may influence anti-gp210 antibody 
production such as HLA, as well as environmental and genetic factors in patients of
various ethnicities [49,55-57].
2: Anti-sp100 and anti-PML antibodies
The nuclear protein sp100 is a transcription factor that co-localizes with 
PML, another transcription coactivator [37,38,39]. Antibodies to sp100 and PML are 
detected in a dot-like distribution within the nucleus (MND pattern) with IIF (Figure 
1D) [8,37,58]. Anti-sp100 and anti-PML antibodies are highly specific for PBC, with a
prevalence of approximately 20–40% and 15–20%, respectively, in PBC patients
(Table1) [37,58-62]. Antibodies to sp100 and PML typically co-exist in PBC; however, 
they do not cross-react [58]. In addition, approximately 74% of PBC patients with 
9

urinary tract infections are positive for anti-sp100 antibodies, but only 4.8% of PBC 
patients do not have urinary tract infections [61]. These findings may support the 
hypothesis that some bacteria such as Escherichia coli are involved in the induction of 
autoantibodies in PBC [61]. Anti-sp100 or anti-PML antibody positivity is associated 
with disease severity and poor prognosis in European populations [59,60,62]. However, 
the significance of these antibodies remains to be determined in different ethnicities,
including the Japanese population [48].
3: Anti-centromere antibodies (ACAs)
Kinetochore is the protein structure on the centromere, which is 
composed of more than 100 distinct proteins. It is the site to which spindle fibers attach 
during cell division to pull sister chromatids apart [9]. ACAs, which were originally 
found in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc), are found in a discrete speckled pattern 
of nuclear staining in HEp-2 cells (Figure 1E) [9,37,63]. Kinetochore proteins,
including CENP-A (17 kDa), CENP-B (~80 kDa), and CENP-C (140 kDa), are the 
major autoantigens recognized by ACAs [9]. ACAs are detected in approximately 90% 
of patients with limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis (LcSS, formerly known as CREST
syndrome: calcinosis, Raynaud’s phenomenon, esophageal dysmotility, sclerodactyly, 
10

and telangiectasia). ACAs are detected in up to 30% of patients with diffuse cutaneous 
SSc (dSSc) [63,64]. ACAs are also found in other autoimmune diseases including
Sjogren’s syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and PBC [9]. 
Of note, ACA is detected in 10 to 30% of PBC patients without any 
apparent clinical manifestations of concomitant SSc [5,6,37,48,49,53,65]. The 
prevalence of ACAs in PBC patients is much higher than in patients with both PBC and 
SSC (1–2%) [66], indicating that ACAs are present in the serum of PBC patients 
without evidence of co-existing SSc. In addition, ACAs are significantly associated with 
the pathogenesis of PBC along with other PBC-specific autoantibodies such as AMA, 
anti-gp210, and anti-sp100.
One clinically relevant question is whether ACAs are a pre-clinical 
marker of future SSc in patients with PBC alone, or whether ACA-positive PBC 
patients have a subclinical form of the disease. To address this, ACA-positive PBC 
patients have been studied with regards to disease severity, prognosis, and clinical 
phenotype [48,49]. The results from one Japanese cohort so far indicate that (1) ACSs, 
in contrast to anti-gp210 antibodies, are detected before the onset of PBC, and ACA 
titers are stable (i.e., they do not change from positive to negative or vice versa over
time); (2) PBC patients who are positive for ACAs are at high risk for progression to 
11

cirrhosis and portal hypertension, but not to persistent jaundice and hepatic failure; (3) 
ACA positivity is histologically associated with more severe ductular reaction [48,49]. 
These findings are supported by additional studies [46, 53], but there are also reports 
indicating that ACA-positive PBC patients do not differ from ACA-negative PBC 
patients [65,66]. Since ACAs and anti-gp210 antibodies tend to be mutually exclusive,
the significance of ACAs in the progression of PBC must be carefully evaluated in 
association with other risk factors including HLA and the presence of anti-gp210 
antibodies [49]. SSc patients who are positive for ACAs invariably have Raynaud’s 
phenomenon. ACAs are also associated with an elevated risk of pulmonary 
hypertension but not pulmonary fibrosis, indicating that ACAs can be a marker for 
differentiating between clinical phenotypes of SSc [63]. The mechanism of ACA 
production and its clinical significance as a marker for differentiating between clinical 
phenotypes in PBC remain important issues to be addressed.
4: Other ANAs detected in PBC
Autoantibodies to SUMOs and sp140, which appear in a MND pattern, 
and autoantibodies to p62 and lamin B receptor, which appear in a NE, are detected in 
2–9%, 15%, 10–30%, and 2–9 %, respectively, of PBC patients in a disease-specific 
12

manner (Table 1) [37,38,39,45,68,69]. However, the clinical significance of these 
autoantibodies remains to be determined in patients of different ethnicities. 
IV. Three types of PBC progression 
Three major forms of PBC were identified by Poupon et al [2]: (1) the
typical or classical form, represented by a slow, progressive loss of small bile ducts and 
parallel increase in liver fibrosis, leading to biliary cirrhosis over a period of 10 to 20 
years; (2) fluctuating or persistent presence of AIH features associated with early 
development of liver fibrosis and liver failure, seen in 10–20% of patients; and (3) the 
so-called premature ductopenic variant seen in 5–10% of patients, represented by a very 
rapid onset of ductopenia and severe icteric cholestasis with progression to cirrhosis and 
liver failure in less than 5 years. Within the typical or classical variant of PBC described 
above, we found that there are three types of clinical evolution in a large cohort study in 
Japan: (1) minimum to very slow progression over time, (2) relatively slow progression 
to cirrhosis or portal hypertension without the development of persistent jaundice or
hepatic failure (portal hypertension-type progression), and (3) relatively rapid 
progression to jaundice and hepatic failure (jaundice-type progression) (Figure 2)
[10,11,48,49]. Based on this classification, anti-gp210 antibody positivity is the strong 
13

risk factor for jaundice-type progression, while ACA positivity is a risk factor for portal 
hypertension-type progression (Figure 2) [10,11,48,49]. Since the natural course of 
PBC is being altered by treatment with UDCA, the clinical significance of these 
PBC-specific autoantibodies awaits re-evaluation in prospective studies in various 
ethnicities.
V. Conclusion
It is of note that the autoimmune repertoire as represented by 
autoantibody status, which is established during the early stages of the disease process, 
can influence the clinical phenotype and long-term prognosis of PBC. In addition, this 
autoimmune status can be normalized by treatment with UDCA, given that anti-gp210 
antibodies can become negative with UCDA therapy; even AMAs can become negative
with UDCA therapy in some patients in an early phase of the disease [41,48,49,54]. To
understand the mechanisms of autoantibody production (i.e. AMAs, anti-gp210
antibodies, anti-sp100 antibodies, and ACAs) and its clinical significance, further 
studies are needed in association with environmental and genetic factors that might 
influence the production of these autoantibodies in PBC.

Figure 1 AMAs and ANAs detected in PBC. 
A: AMAs detected by IIF using sections of rat kidney and stomach. Positive 
immunofluorescence is observed in the mitochondria-rich kidney (left) and the parietal 
cells of the stomach (right), but not in the smooth muscle of the stomach (middle).
B: AMA detected by IIF in HEp-2 cells. The mitochondria in the cytoplasm are 
positively stained.
C: Nuclear envelope (NE) pore complexes (gp210, p62) are positively stained in a NE
pattern.
D: Nuclear proteins (sp100, PML, sp140, SUMO) are positively stained in a multiple 
nuclear dot (MND) pattern.
E: Centromere proteins (centromere protein A, B, C) are positively stained in a discrete 
speckled pattern (centromere pattern).
F: Nuclear lamina (lamin A, B, C, and lamin B receptor) are positively stained in a
smooth rim-like pattern.

Anti-gp210 antibody positivity is a risk factor for hepatic failure-type progression, 
while anti-centromere antibody positivity is a risk factor for portal hypertension-type 
progression in Japanese cohort studies [10,11,41,48,49].
