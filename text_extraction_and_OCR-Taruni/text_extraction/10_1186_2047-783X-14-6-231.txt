Abstract
Objective: Pneumatosis intestinalis has been increas￾ingly detected in recent years with the more frequent
use of computed tomography for abdominal imaging
of the intestine. The underlying causes of the gas
found during radiographic studies of the bowel wall
can vary widely and different hypotheses regarding its
pathophysiology have been postulated. Pneumatosis
intestinalis often represents a benign condition and
should not be considered an argument for surgery.
However, it can also require life-threatening surgery in
some cases, and this can be a difficult decision in some
patients.
Methods: The spectrum of pneumatosis intestinalis is
discussed here based on various computed tomograph￾ic and surgical findings in patients who presented at our
University Medical Centre in 2003–2008. We have also
systematically reviewed the literature to establish the
current understanding of its aetiology and pathophysi￾ology, and the possible clinical conditions associated
with pneumatosis intestinalis and their management.
Results: Pneumatosis intestinalis is a primary radi￾ographic finding. After its diagnosis, its specific patho￾genesis should be ascertained because the appropriate
therapy is related to the underlying cause of pneu￾matosis intestinalis, and this is sometimes difficult to
define. Surgical treatment should be considered urgent
in symptomatic patients presenting with an acute ab￾domen, signs of ischemia, or bowel obstruction. In
asymptomatic patients with otherwise inconspicuous
findings, the underlying disease should be treated first,
rather than urgent exploratory surgery considered. Ex￾tensive and comprehensive information on the patho￾physiology and clinical findings of pneumatosis in￾testinalis is provided here and is incorporated into a
treatment algorithm.
Conclusions: The information presented here allows a
better understanding of the radiographic diagnosis
and underlying aetiology of pneumatosis intestinalis,
and may facilitate the decision-making process in this
context, thus providing fast and adequate therapy to
particular patients.

1. INTRODUCTION
Pneumatosis intestinalis is an imaging phenomenon
representing the presence of gas in the bowel wall. It
was first recognized by DuVernoi in 1730 during a ca￾daver dissection, and there have since been numerous
reports of various underlying diseases [1–7]. Pneu￾matosis intestinalis was defined as a radiographic diag￾nosis by Lerner and Gazin as early as 1946 [8]. The
clinical relevance of pneumatosis intestinalis varies
widely and ranges from benign to life-threatening con￾ditions depending on the underlying cause of pneu￾matosis intestinalis [4, 7]. The latter can entail high
mortality if exploratory surgery is delayed [4, 6, 7, 9].
The incidence of pneumatosis intestinalis is not yet
precisely known, but it is increasingly reported because
of the more frequent use of computed tomographic
abdominal studies and recent improvements in imaging
techniques [4, 7, 9]. Conversely, many new surgical pro￾cedures, medications, and medical treatments have con￾tributed to the increase in this particular radiographic
phenomenon. However, based on autopsy studies, its
incidence in the general population has been estimated
as three per 10,000 individuals [4]. Pneumatosis intesti￾nalis can occur at any age, depending on the underlying
cause. However, it is seen more frequently in older pa￾tients than in young adults or infants. The sex-specific
distribution of this entity has not yet been described in
the literature. So far, over 60 possible causative diseases
have been proposed as contributing to gas accumula￾tion within the bowel wall [6, 7]. Most patients with a
diagnosis of pneumatosis intestinalis can be managed
without surgery by treating the causative disease. In
1998, Pear introduced a classification of the major
pathogenic mechanisms causally involved in intramural
gas formation, which included (i) bowel necrosis, (ii)
mucosal disruption, (iii) increased mucosal permeabili￾June 18, 2009

ty, and (iv) pulmonary disease [6]. Of these possible ae￾tiologies, bowel necrosis appears to be the most com￾mon and life-threatening cause of intramural gas for￾mation. In such cases, portal venous gas embolisation
may be present because of a denuded mucosa [6]. Dif￾ferent types of gas formation occur, including bubble￾and linear-shaped patterns, and some authors have at￾tempted to assign these to one of the pathogenic caus￾es discussed above, but with no confident results [4, 6,
10–17]. It is imperative that the imaging finding of
pneumatosis intestinalis is carefully correlated with the
clinical findings of a physical examination, clinical his￾tory, and laboratory test results to determine which pa￾tients can be managed medically by treating the under￾lying disease and which will require emergency surgery.
This decision-making process is critical and can be dif￾ficult because the origin of the gas is often unclear and
the patient’s symptoms can be volatile, presenting a ma￾jor dilemma for the surgeon in charge. Here, we ad￾dress these issues with respect to the nature and patho￾physiology of pneumatosis intestinalis and extend our
knowledge by reviewing the current literature. Al￾though descriptive radiological reviews and various case
reports of pneumatosis intestinalis are available, includ￾ing case-related therapies and outcomes, there is a lack
of information with regard to an acceptable structured
treatment-directed process [4, 6, 7]. Therefore, based
on our own experiences at the Department of Surgery
at the Ludwig-Maximilians University, Munich, and a
critical review of the literature, we provide a treatment
algorithm for the better and faster management of pa￾tients with a radiographic diagnosis of pneumatosis in￾testinalis.
2. MATERIAL AND METHODS
A systematic literature search was performed using
PubMed, with the key words pneumatosis intestinalis
and mucosal gas, in conjunction with aetiology, patho￾physiology, risk factors, and surgery. We also searched
the in-hospital database for patients with diagnoses of
pneumatosis intestinalis presenting in 2003–2008 and
reviewed the patients’ histories, therapies, courses, and
outcomes.
3. RESULTS
We present the different typical computed tomograph￾ic and intra-operative findings of patients treated for
pneumatosis intestinalis at the Division of General
and Visceral Surgery, Department of Surgery, Ludwig￾Maximilians University, Munich. Representative opera￾tive and computed tomographic findings were selected
and are given in Figure 1-4. The present selection
demonstrates the wide range of diseases associated
with pneumatosis intestinalis. Moreover, extended in￾formation was collected with regard to the nature and
pathophysiology of this primary radiographic diagno￾sis with a PubMed database search, which was used as
the basis for the decision-making process presented
here. The in-hospital review of patients with a diagno￾sis of pneumatosis intestinalis, the diagnostic process,
and their therapies and outcomes have been incorpo￾rated into the algorithm presented here.
3.1. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Pneumatosis intestinalis is defined as the presence of
gas in the bowel wall [4,6,7]. The gas inclusion can oc￾cur to various extents in the small or large bowel, or
even in both. The intramural gas may appear cystic,
bubbly, curvilinear, or linear [6]. A pneumoperi￾toneum, pneumoretroperitoneum, or even portal ve￾nous gas inclusions can also be present [6]. Different
theories have been proposed to explain the nature and
pathophysiology of intramural gas [2, 4, 6, 7, 18–26].
However, the exact cause of the gas remains unknown
[4]. In 1998, Pear classified the causes of pneumatosis
intestinalis into four essential pathologies: bowel
necrosis, mucosal disruption, increased mucosal per￾meability, and pulmonary disease [6]. Two main theo￾ries of the pathophysiology of gas formation in the
bowel wall have been proposed in recent years, based
on a mechanical or a bacterial cause [4, 26]. The me￾chanical theory hypothesizes that the gas moves into
the bowel wall from either the intestinal lumen or the
lungs via the mediastinum by different mechanisms,
leading to an increase in pressure. The bacterial theory
proposes that the gas is produced by gas-forming bac￾teria that enter the mucosal barrier through mucosal
rents or increased mucosal permeability and produce
the gas within the bowel wall [4, 26]. In contrast to
those theories, St. Peter and co-workers have suggest￾ed that the pathophysiology of pneumatosis intesti￾nalis convincingly reflects the origin of the gas, postu￾lating the three major sources: (i) intraluminal gas￾trointestinal gas, (ii) bacterial gas production, and (iii)
pulmonary gas. These are summarized below [7].
(i) Intraluminal gas
An increase in intraluminal pressure, which may occur
with blunt trauma, pyloric stenosis in infants, or bowel
obstruction, can cause pneumatosis intestinalis,
whether or not the mucosal barrier is intact. However,
at least some degree of associated mucosal injury is
most likely when blunt trauma precedes pneumatosis
intestinalis. Here, enhanced gut permeability to gas
may be induced by defects in the mucosa, the immune
barrier, or both. A reduced mucosal barrier and nor￾mal luminal pressure are seen, for instance, in congeni￾tal or acquired immunodeficiency, and in patients re￾ceiving immunosuppressive therapy. In these patients,
bacterial intrusion or gas diffusion into the bowel wall
is more likely to occur.
(ii) Bacterial gas
In recent years, several authors have suggested that
bacterial gas production is a relevant factor in pneu￾matosis intestinalis, and this is supported by reports of
the disappearance of the gas after antimicrobial drug
therapy. Bacterial gas can accumulate after the direct
invasion of the bowel wall by bacteria or by their alter￾ation of the intraluminal gas content. Gas-producing
bacteria reach the intramural compartment because of
an increase in intramural pressure, mucosal injury, or a
combination of these factors. This possible mecha￾nism is supported by the theory of counter perfusion su￾persaturation, whereby the intraluminal bacterially pro￾duced hydrogen tension exceeds the nitrogen tension
232 EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL RESEARCH June 18, 2009

in the blood, causing a hydrogen diffusion gradient to￾wards the submucosal vessels. This theory may also
explain the pneumatosis observed near blood vessels
along the mesenteric border.
(iii) Pulmonary gas
Another possible source of pneumatosis intestinalis is
pulmonary gas. It has been postulated that alveolar rup￾ture can result in the movement of air along vascular
channels in the mediastinum, tracking caudally via the
retroperitoneum and to the mesentery of the bowel.
Pulmonary gas migration to the subserosal layer of the
intestine has been observed in patients with pulmonary
disease. It is more likely that the gas migrates along
these vessels in these patients than that it has a trans￾mural origin. Conversely, many of these patients show
no signs of interstitial lung or mesenteric emphysema,
prompting the theory that in this population, the gas is
caused by an increase in intra-abdominal pressure re￾sulting from pulmonary obstruction, together with a re￾duced barrier function caused by corticoid therapy.
3.2. CLINICAL SPECTRUM
Pneumatosis intestinalis is a radiographic phenome￾non produced by underlying diseases or conditions,
which can vary widely [4, 6, 7]. It has been shown that
the pattern or extent of pneumatosis intestinalis does
not necessarily correlate with the severity of the
symptoms or underlying disease [7, 25, 27]. Mesen￾teric ischemia, bowel obstruction, and bowel necrosis
represent the most life-threatening causes of pneu￾matosis intestinalis [4, 7, 9, 28]. In this context, it
must be noted that proven pneumatosis intestinalis in
conjunction with a serum lactic acid level exceeding 2
mmol/L entails a high rate of fatal outcomes, of over
80% [9, 29]. However, pneumatosis intestinalis may
also be the result of numerous non-ischemic and
non-obstructive conditions, most of which are appar￾ently not associated with unfavourable outcomes [4, 7,
17, 30]. Thus, in recent years, over 60 causative dis￾eases and conditions have been identified in this con￾text [7]. We must be aware that a number of causes
can be both benign and life threatening, depending on
the circumstances [4, 7]. It is often challenging in clin￾ical practice to distinguish those patients who defini￾tively require surgery and those who can be observed
or managed conservatively with the appropriate treat￾ment of the underlying disease without any need for
exploratory surgery.
Pneumatosis intestinalis can originate from pul￾monary, systemic, or intestinal bowel diseases and con￾ditions. Moreover, numerous iatrogenic causes have
been described in the literature. Other major causes, in￾cluding medication-associated or even postoperative
aetiologies, have been described. Vascular diseases or
their associated diseases and conditions contribute
substantially to the life-threatening causes of pneu￾matosis intestinalis, as discussed above. Finally, idio￾pathic forms of pneumatosis intestinalis are described
in literature and account for about 15% of all cases.

and conditions associated with pneumatosis intestinalis
[4–7, 31–66]. Some causes of pneumatosis intestinalis
can be classified as both benign and life-threatening
conditions [4].
The benign causes of pneumatosis intestinalis usu￾ally result in only mild or even no abdominal symp￾toms. Patients usually display cardiopulmonary stabili￾ty, with lactate levels within the normal limits, and do
not present with septic signs or respiratory acidosis
[9]. In these patients, there is often no computed to￾mographic abnormalities other than the diagnosis of
pneumatosis. In contrast, patients with life-threatening
causes of pneumatosis intestinalis usually display peri￾toneal symptoms. A retrospective analysis of 919 doc￾umented cases of pneumatosis intestinalis identified
diarrhoea, bloody stools, abdominal pain, constipa￾tion, weight loss, and tenesmus as the most common
related symptoms, in descending order [30]. Another
retrospective analysis of a 10-year period at a single in￾stitution found, with a multivariable analysis, that age
≥ 60 years, the presence of emesis, and a white blood
cell count of > 12 c/mm3 were independently associ￾ated with surgical management, and that pre-existing
sepsis correlated with a higher risk of death in this
context [9].
3.3. DIAGNOSIS AND THERAPY
The diagnosis of pneumatosis intestinalis is made, in
general, by computed tomography or plain radiogra￾phy of the abdomen, although computed tomography
is the most sensitive imaging modality [4]. After the
identification of pneumatosis intestinalis, a prompt
further evaluation of the patient should be made. This
should include concomitant radiographic findings,
such as wall thickening, the presence of portal venous
gas, and free intra-abdominal air. The morphological
signs of gas formation in the bowel wall can be classi￾fied as: (i) cystic or bubbly, if consisting mainly of iso￾lated bubbles of air; or (ii) curvilinear or linear, if con￾sisting of continuous bands of air in the bowel wall [6,
28]. Linear or curvilinear pneumatosis is thought to be
more characteristic of bowel ischemia, and of the
presence of portal venous gas, than is bubbly pneu￾matosis, which may be more often benign, although
this cannot be considered a rule [4, 7, 9–12, 14, 17].
The radiographic location and appearance of the gas
may be helpful, but they do not represent pathognom￾ic features for the diagnosis of its origin. A strong in￾dicator of the presence of mesenteric infarction or
segmental ischemia, and therefore an indication for

emergency exploratory surgery, is the association of
pneumatosis intestinalis with portomesenteric venous
gas [4, 6, 9, 10, 21]. However, pneumatosis and por￾tomesenteric venous gas can also occur together in a
variety of non-ischemic conditions that are not associ￾ated with an unfavourable outcome [10, 12, 16, 67,
68]. Signs of bowel perforation or peritonitis also war￾rant emergency surgery. However, in asymptomatic
patients with radiographic signs of pneumatosis in￾testinalis but no concomitant signs of bowel obstruc￾tion or free peritoneal air, emergency exploratory
surgery is not indicated [2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 17, 50]. It is most
often appropriate that these patients are observed and
treated conservatively.
The therapeutic management of pneumatosis in￾testinalis must focus on the underlying disease rather
than on the radiographic sign itself [4, 6, 7]. Thus, the
medical history of the patient and his/her current
medications should be evaluated carefully to guide fur￾ther decision processes. In this context, it is advisable
to enquire about the different categories of associated
conditions, such as pulmonary, gastrointestinal, au￾toimmune, infectious, pulmonary, iatrogenic, drug-in￾duced, or transplantation-related conditions, as shown
in Figure 1. Thus, the survey should determine any
types of pulmonary disease, recent gastrointestinal in￾tervention or surgery, inflammatory bowel disease, his￾tory of gastrointestinal complaints such as gastroen￾teritis symptoms, autoimmune disease, infectious dis￾ease, or any type of vascular disease. Queries about
currently used medications should be included in the
interview, especially any cytotoxic, immunsuppressive,
or corticosteroid drugs, and the use of lactulose, sor￾bitol, or glucosidase inhibitors. The core temperature
should be measured by rectal probe and the patient
asked to relate any recent history of fever or shivering,
or current emesis. During the physical examination,
the extent of the abdominal complaint should be eval￾uated. The examination must include bowel sounds,
any palpable resistance indicative of an abdominal
mass, and signs of peritonism. The heart rate and
blood pressure must be documented, together with
the respiration rate and volume, and oxygen supplied
as needed. Routine laboratory tests should be made,
including a blood count, test for coagulation, elec￾trolytes, serum creatinine, C-reactive protein, and lac￾tic acid, and liver and pancreatic indices. The decision￾making process is the culmination of the findings ob￾tained during the survey described here, and will in￾clude three possible treatment options: (i) emergency
surgery, (ii) observation, followed by later re-evalua￾tion, and (iii) medical treatment of the underlying dis￾ease. Figure 5 summarizes the queries and the results
obtained, and provides support for each particular de￾cision level with a formal treatment algorithm.
4. DISCUSSION
This paper provides detailed information on our cur￾rent understanding of pneumatosis intestinalis with re￾gard to its natural history, clinical spectrum, and med￾ical management. We searched the current literature
and reviewed the patients evaluated for pneumatosis
intestinalis within the last five years at our Department
of Surgery. There are numerous reports, especially case
reports and some structured reviews, in the literature
dealing with pneumatosis intestinalis, and the question
can be raised whether there is a need for the present
paper [31–66]. However, there is a lack of information
regarding the medical management of particular pa￾tients presenting with pneumatosis intestinalis. More￾over, current reviews usually focus on the findings of
apparative diagnostics, e.g., computed tomography and
plain radiography from a radiological point of view,
rather than on the provision of support for clinical
management [4–7]. To the best of our knowledge, only
a few available papers address these issues [9, 29, 69].
It must be stressed that the underlying cause of pneu￾matosis intestinalis is the most important factor, in
conjunction with its clinical presentation and laborato￾ry results, in the management of patients with radi￾ographically demonstrable pneumatosis intestinalis [4,
9, 7, 28]. Three possible decisions can be made from a
surgical point of view: (i) does the patient require
emergency surgery? (ii) can the patient be simply ob￾served, with later re-evaluation? or (iii) can the patient
be managed conservatively by treating the underlying
disease? This decision process is crucial because any
delay will probably affect the patient’s outcome. It is
clear from the literature that the underlying disease not
only determines this outcome but also the length of
time available until exploratory surgery is performed.
Greenstein and co-workers observed in their recent
study a trend to a lower mortality rate in patients re￾ceiving operative therapy with a delay of < 6 h after
the diagnosis of pneumatosis intestinalis [9].
We have described the different pathogenic theories
of pneumatosis intestinalis and its associated clinical
features. However, pneumatosis intestinalis remains
incompletely understood and seems to be a multifac￾torial entity. In general, two theories have been pro￾posed, the mechanical and the bacterial, which can be
further divided by detail. It is most likely that pneu￾matosis intestinalis is a combination of both causes.
We must be aware that the pattern or extent of pneu￾matosis intestinalis does not necessarily correlate with
the severity of the symptoms or the underlying disease
[7, 27]. There is a long and confusing list of disorders
and conditions associated in the literature with pneu￾matosis intestinalis. Therefore, to minimise confusion,
it is important to sort these into the eight major cate￾gories: (i) pulmonary, (ii) gastrointestinal, (iii) autoim￾mune and systemic, (iv) infectious, (v) iatrogenic, (vi)
drug induced, (vii) post-transplantational, and (viii) id￾iopathic.
Life-threatening conditions are most often associat￾ed with mesenteric ischemia, bowel necrosis, or bowel
obstruction. These patients often present with signs of
sepsis and symptoms of shock. An acute abdomen is
often the predominant clinical feature and the out￾come for these patients is the most unfavourable
among patients with pneumatosis intstinalis. In im￾munocompromised patients, those receiving steroids,
those at early presentation, or multimorbid patients,
the diagnosis can sometimes be difficult because only
discrete symptoms may be present. In these patients,
further radiographic signs, like bowel-wall thickening
or the whirlpool sign and the presence of concomitant
June 18, 2009 EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL RESEARCH 237

portal venous gas or free intra-abdominal air, should
also be taken in account, together with their laboratory
results. The combination of pneumatosis intestinalis
and portal venous gas is associated with bowel is￾chemia in about 70% of cases [14, 16]. In this context,
Greenstein and co-workers showed with multivariable
analysis that an age of ≥ 60 years, the presence of
emesis, and a white blood count of > 12 c/mm3 are
independent factors associated with surgical manage￾ment in patients with pneumatosis intestinalis [9].
Moreover, a serum lactate concentration of ≥ 2.0
mmol/L is associated with an unfavourable outcome,
as is the presence of sepsis, hypotension, metabolic
acidosis, or a thickened bowel wall. Although the pres￾ence of portal venous gas in combination with pneu￾matosis intestinalis can occur in benign conditions, its
presence is an indication for surgery if iatrogenic
causes can be excluded, because bowel ischemia is
most likely and a delay in exploratory surgery will
worsen the patient’s outcome [9, 10]. When non-surgi￾cal management is undertaken initially, the patient
should be subsequently re-evaluated, with exploratory
surgery performed if he/she does not respond to
medical therapy or the condition worsens [7].
We have here provided a treatment algorithm for
patients with a diagnosis of pneumatosis intestinalis,
based on our own experiences with pneumatosis in￾testinalis and the findings of a literature search. Rather
than being a strict instruction guide, this structured al￾gorithm supports the decision-making process. It may
help to reduce the rate of patients with benign forms
of pneumatosis unnecessarily subjected to exploratory
surgery and reduce the delay in surgical therapy for
those patients who would profit from early surgical in￾tervention [9, 17].
