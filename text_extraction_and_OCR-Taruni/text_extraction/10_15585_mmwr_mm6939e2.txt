On September 28, 2020, this report was posted as an MMWR
Early Release on the MMWR website (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr). 
Approximately 56 million school-aged children (aged 
5–17 years) resumed education in the United States in fall 2020.* 
Analysis of demographic characteristics, underlying conditions, 
clinical outcomes, and trends in weekly coronavirus disease 
2019 (COVID-19) incidence during March 1–September 19, 
2020 among 277,285 laboratory-confirmed cases in school-aged 
children in the United States might inform decisions about 
in-person learning and the timing and scaling of community 
mitigation measures. During May–September 2020, average 
weekly incidence (cases per 100,000 children) among adolescents 
aged 12–17 years (37.4) was approximately twice that of children 
aged 5–11 years (19.0). In addition, among school-aged chil￾dren, COVID-19 indicators peaked during July 2020: weekly 
percentage of positive SARS-CoV-2 test results increased from 
10% on May 31 to 14% on July 5; SARS-CoV-2 test volume 
increased from 100,081 tests on May 31 to 322,227 on July 12, 
and COVID-19 incidence increased from 13.8 per 100,000 on 
May 31 to 37.9 on July 19. During July and August, test volume 
and incidence decreased then plateaued; incidence decreased further 
during early September and might be increasing. Percentage of 
positive test results decreased during August and plateaued during 
September. Underlying conditions were more common among 
school-aged children with severe outcomes related to COVID-19: 
among school-aged children who were hospitalized, admitted to 
an intensive care unit (ICU), or who died, 16%, 27%, and 28%, 
respectively, had at least one underlying medical condition. Schools 
and communities can implement multiple, concurrent mitigation 
strategies and tailor communications to promote mitigation strat￾egies to prevent COVID-19 spread. These results can provide a 
baseline for monitoring trends and evaluating mitigation strategies.
School-aged children were stratified by age into two groups: 
children aged 5–11 years and adolescents aged 12–17 years. 
Confirmed COVID-19 cases were identified from individual￾level case reports submitted by state health departments for the 
weeks beginning March 1–September 13, 2020.† Confirmed 
cases had a positive real-time reverse transcription–polymerase 
chain reaction (RT-PCR) test result for SARS-CoV-2, the virus

that causes COVID-19. COVID-19 case data for all children 
were analyzed to examine demographic characteristics, under￾lying conditions,§ hospitalization, ICU admission, and death. 
Trends were analyzed using CDC report date¶ to calculate a 
a daily 7-day moving average, aggregated by week. Analyses 
are descriptive; statistical comparisons were not performed.
To examine trends in laboratory testing volume and percent￾age of positive test results, data from COVID-19 electronic 
laboratory data were used. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test results 
were obtained for the weeks beginning May 31–September 13, 
2020 from COVID-19 electronic laboratory reporting data 
submitted by state health departments (37 states); when age 
was unavailable in state-submitted data, information from data 
submitted directly by public health, commercial, and refer￾ence laboratories (13 states, Puerto Rico, and the District of 
†During the COVID-19 pandemic, CDC receives both aggregate and individual 
(i.e., line-list) counts of cases and deaths from reporting jurisdictions. CDC official 
counts of cases and deaths, released daily at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-
ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html, are aggregate counts from reporting 
jurisdictions. Some jurisdictions electronically submit standardized information for 
individual cases of COVID-19 to CDC using the Human Infection with 2019 
Novel Coronavirus Case Report Form (COVID-19 Case Report Form) developed 
for the CDC COVID-19 response (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/
php/reporting-pui.html) or the CDC National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance 
System (NNDSS) (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/covid-19-response.html). 
Individual-level case report data were available for approximately 69% of the 
aggregate number of confirmed cases. Cases reported without sex or age data and 
in persons repatriated to the United States from Wuhan, China, or the Diamond 
Princess cruise ship were excluded from this analysis.
§Underlying conditions were defined based on the categories included in the 
COVID-19 Case Report Form including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, severe 
obesity (body mass index [BMI] ≥40 kg/m2), cardiovascular disease, chronic renal 
disease, chronic liver disease, chronic lung disease (asthma, emphysema, and 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD]), other (specified) chronic 
diseases, other (specified) underlying condition or risk behavior, immunosuppressive 
conditions, autoimmune conditions, being a current or former smoker, substance 
abuse or misuse, disability (neurologic, neurodevelopmental, intellectual, physical, 
vision or hearing impairment, and psychological/psychiatric condition). Although 
obesity in children is not generally defined using BMI, these data are drawn from 
the NNDSS case report form in which severe obesity is defined as noted.
¶CDC report date is the date the case was reported to CDC by the state health 
department. If CDC report date was missing, report date was populated with the 
earliest date in a series of variables submitted by the jurisdiction, including hospital 
or ICU admission and discharge date, diagnosis date, symptom onset and resolution 
dates, and positive specimen dates. As of August 9, 2020, approximately 10% of 
reported COVID-19 confirmed cases in the 50 states and District of Columbia 
had no available date information; it cannot be estimated when these were reported 
to CDC during May–August 2020 (the analytic period for this study).

Columbia) were used.** Data represent test results, not number 
of persons tested; specimen collection date or test order date 
was used for analysis.†† The weekly percentage of positive 
SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test results was calculated nationally for 
each U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) 
Region§§ as the number of positive test results divided by the 
sum of positive and negative test results.
During March 1–September 19, 2020, a total of 277,285 
laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in school-aged 
children were reported in the United States, including 101,503 
(37%) in children aged 5–11 years and 175,782 (63%) in 
adolescents aged 12–17 years (Table). Overall, 50.8% were 
in females (aged 5–11 years = 49.4%; aged 12–17 = 51.6%). 
Among 161,387 (58%) school-aged children with COVID-19 
and complete information on race/ethnicity, 42% were 
Hispanic/Latino (Hispanic), 32% were non-Hispanic White 
(White), and 17% were non-Hispanic Black (Black). Hispanic 
children accounted for 46% of cases among younger children 
and 39% among adolescents; White children accounted for 
26% of cases in younger children and 36% in adolescents.¶¶
Weekly incidence among school-aged children increased from 
March 1, peaking at 37.9 cases per 100,000 the week of July 19 
** COVID-19 Electronic Laboratory Reporting data submitted by state health 
departments from all laboratories performing SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing 
were used for 37 states (Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, 
Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, 
Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, 
Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, North Carolina, 
Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, 
Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wisconsin). SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR 
testing data from a subset of public health, commercial, and reference 
laboratories were used for the District of Columbia and 14 states/territories 
(California, Delaware, Maine, Mississippi, Missouri, New Mexico, New York, 
North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, Washington, 
and Wyoming). The data from the public health, commercial, and reference 
laboratories represent approximately 50% of all tests. The data might not 
include results from all testing sites within a jurisdiction (e.g., point-of-care 
test sites) and therefore reflect the majority of, but not all, SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR 
tests in the United States. The data represent laboratory test totals, not 
individual persons tested, and exclude antibody and antigen tests.
†† For COVID-19 electronic laboratory reporting data, state was assigned using 
the state health department reporting the test (available for 100% of tests), 
and specimen collection date was used to assign date (available for 
approximately 98% of tests); those with missing specimen collection date 
were excluded. Within data submitted directly by public health, commercial, 
and reference laboratories, state was assigned using patient location for 96% 
of tests; provider location was substituted for 1%, and records with both 
location fields missing (3%) were excluded; order date was used for 80% of 
tests, specimen collection date was substituted for 19%, and records with both 
date fields missing (1%) were excluded.

5–11 years and 24% of adolescents aged 12–17 years; children of non-Hispanic 
Black race comprised 14% of children aged 5–11 years and 14% of adolescents 
12–17 years; and children of non-Hispanic White race comprised 50% of 
children aged 5–11 years and 52% of adolescents aged 12–17 years in the United

(aged 5–11 years = 25.7; aged 12–17 years = 51.9), plateaued 
at an average of 34 per 100,000 during July 26–August 23, 
decreased to 22.6 per 100,000 the week of September 6, and 
rebounded to 26.3 per 100,000 the last week for which data 
are available (Figure 1) (Supplementary Figure 1, https://stacks.
cdc.gov/view/cdc/94150). Trends in incidence were similar 
among both age groups. Incidence among adolescents was 
approximately double that among younger children through￾out the reporting period. During May–September, average 
weekly incidence among adolescents was 37.4 cases per 100,000 
compared with 19.0 per 100,000 for younger children.
Weekly SARS-CoV-2 laboratory test volume among 
school-aged children more than tripled, from 100,081 tests 
performed during the week beginning May 31 to a peak of 
322,227 during the week beginning July 12, then decreased 
to approximately 260,000 during August and rebounded in 
September; test volume was higher among adolescents than 
younger children (Figure 2) (Supplementary Figure 1, https://
stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/94150) (Supplementary Figure 2, 
https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/94151). The percentage of 
positive SARS-CoV-2 laboratory test results increased for both 
age groups from May 31 and peaked during the week beginning 
July 5; percentage of positive test results then decreased among 
both age groups. Since August 23, the percentage of positive 
SARS-CoV-2 laboratory test results plateaued at 7% among 
adolescents and continued to decrease among younger children.
HHS Regions 6, 4, and 9 had the highest weekly percent￾age of positive test results, peaking during the week of July 5 
at 24% (Region 6), 18% (Region 4), and 17% (Region 9), 
and all declined to approximately 8% the week beginning 
September 13 (Supplementary Figure 2, https://stacks.cdc.gov/
view/cdc/94151). In Region 1, weekly percentage of positive 
tests decreased from 8% during the week beginning May 31 to 
<2% during the week beginning September 13. In Region 9, 
the percentage of positive test results was similar over time in 
both age groups; in Regions 5 and 7, although the percentage 
of positive test results were initially similar in both age groups, 
beginning in early June (Region 7) and mid-June (Region 5), 
the percentage of positive test results in adolescents exceeded 
that among younger children.
Among school-aged children with laboratory-confirmed 
COVID-19, 58% reported at least one symptom, 5% reported 
no symptoms, and information on symptoms was missing or 
unknown for 37% (Table). Overall, 3,240 (1.2%) school-aged 
children with COVID-19 were hospitalized, including 404 
(0.1%) who required ICU admission. Fifty-one (<0.01%) 
school-aged children died of COVID-19. Among school-aged 
children with complete information on race/ethnicity who 
were hospitalized (2,473 [76%]) or admitted to an ICU (321 
[80%]), Hispanic ethnicity was most commonly reported (45%

Discussion
As education resumes and some schools begin in-person 
learning for the 2020–21 academic year, it is critical to have 
a baseline for monitoring trends in COVID-19 infection 
among school-aged children. Since March, a period during 
which most U.S. schools conducted classes virtually or were 
closed for the summer, the incidence among adolescents was 
approximately double that in younger children. Although 
mortality and hospitalization in school-aged children was low, 
Hispanic ethnicity, Black race, and underlying conditions were 
more commonly reported among children who were hospital￾ized or admitted to an ICU, providing additional evidence 
that some children might be at increased risk for severe illness 
associated with COVID-19 (1–4).††† Acute COVID-19 and 
††† https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/other￾at-risk-populations.html.
multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) have 
been reported to disproportionately affect Hispanic and Black 
children (3,4). Implementing multiple, concurrent mitigation 
strategies and tailored communications about the importance 
of promoting and reinforcing behaviors that reduce spread of 
COVID-19 (e.g., wearing masks, maintaining a social distance 
of ≥6 feet, and frequent handwashing) can reduce COVID-19 
spread in schools and communities.
Monitoring trends in multiple indicators of COVID-19 
could inform mitigation measures to prevent COVID-19 
spread.§§§ COVID-19 incidence increased from March to 
July, and SARS-CoV-2 test volume and weekly percentage 
of positive test results among school-aged children increased 
from late May to July. During March through May, widespread 
shelter-in-place orders were in effect, and most U.S. schools 
transitioned to online learning. In June and July, when com￾munity mitigation measures were relaxed in some areas, inci￾dence increased more rapidly. Recent evidence that monthly 
COVID-19 incidence increased approximately threefold 
among persons aged 0–19 years since May and was highest

among young adults aged 20–29 years during July, suggests that 
young persons might be playing an increasingly important role 
in community transmission (5,6). The percentage of positive test 
results in school-aged children also varied within and across HHS 
regions. Variations in percentage of positive tests might indicate 
differences in community transmission rates. School studies sug￾gest that in-person learning can be safe in communities with low 
SARS-CoV-2 transmission rates¶¶¶ (7) but might increase trans￾mission risk in communities where transmission is already high.****
The findings in this report are subject to at least four limi￾tations. First, these data might underestimate the actual inci￾dence of disease among school-aged children, because testing 
was frequently prioritized for persons with symptoms, and 
asymptomatic infection in children is common (8). These data

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Children aged <10 years can transmit SARS-CoV-2 in school 
settings, but less is known about COVID-19 incidence, charac￾teristics, and health outcomes among school-aged children 
(aged 5–17 years) with COVID-19.
What is added by this report?
Since March, 277,285 COVID-19 cases in children have been 
reported. COVID-19 incidence among adolescents aged 
12–17 years was approximately twice that in children aged 
5–11 years. Underlying conditions were more common among 
school-aged children with severe outcomes related to 
COVID-19. Weekly incidence, SARS-CoV-2 test volume, and 
percentage of tests positive among school-aged children varied 
over time and by region of the United States. 
What are the implications for public health practice?
It is important for schools and communities to monitor multiple 
indicators of COVID-19 among school-aged children and layer 
prevention strategies to reduce COVID-19 disease risk for 
students, teachers, school staff, and families. These results can

mitigation strategies. 
are also from a single reporting system and therefore might not 
represent the total number of cases and deaths in school-aged 
children reported in the United States (1). Second, findings on 
race/ethnicity, symptom status, underlying conditions, and out￾comes should be interpreted with caution; these data had high 
rates of missing or unknown values. Third, because of delays in 
reporting, trend data might lag behind actual disease transmis￾sion dates. Because of missing symptom onset and specimen 
collection dates, COVID-19 cases are presented by the date each 
case was reported to CDC, and surveillance artifacts can exist as 
a result of batch reporting by states.†††† Finally, laboratory data 
presented here underrepresent the volume of laboratory tests 
reported in some states, because state reporting of laboratory 
data and case surveillance is not uniform.§§§§ 
These findings can provide a baseline for monitoring 
national trends. Monitoring at the local-level could inform 
decision-makers about which mitigation strategies are most 
effective in preventing the spread of COVID-19 in schools 
and communities (6,9). CDC’s considerations for schools 
outline important mitigation strategies for safer reopening 
for in-person learning.¶¶¶¶ Schools and communities should

directly to CDC from public health laboratories and a sample of six large 
commercial laboratories.

in CDC’s Community Mitigation Framework: promote behaviors that 
prevent spread, maintain healthy environments, maintain healthy 
operations, and prepare for when someone gets ill. https://www.cdc.gov/

implement multiple concurrent preventive strategies and 
adjust mitigation depending on local levels of transmission to 
reduce COVID-19 disease risk for students, teachers, school 
staff members, families and the community.
