Abstract
Background: Kidney transplantation is the best treatment for patients with end-stage renal failure, but uncertainty
remains about the best immunosuppression strategy. Long-term graft survival has not improved substantially, and
one possible explanation is calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) nephrotoxicity. CNI exposure could be minimized by using
more potent induction therapy or alternative maintenance therapy to remove CNIs completely. However, the safety
and efficacy of such strategies are unknown.
Methods/Design: The Campath, Calcineurin inhibitor reduction and Chronic allograft nephropathy (3C) Study is a
multicentre, open-label, randomized controlled trial with 852 participants which is addressing two important
questions in kidney transplantation. The first question is whether a Campath (alemtuzumab)-based induction
therapy strategy is superior to basiliximab-based therapy, and the second is whether, from 6 months after
transplantation, a sirolimus-based maintenance therapy strategy is superior to tacrolimus-based therapy.
Recruitment is complete, and follow-up will continue for around 5 years post-transplant. The primary endpoint for
the induction therapy comparison is biopsy-proven acute rejection by 6 months, and the primary endpoint for the
maintenance therapy comparison is change in estimated glomerular filtration rate from baseline to 2 years after
transplantation. The study is sponsored by the University of Oxford and endorsed by the British Transplantation
Society, and 18 centers for adult kidney transplant are participating.
Discussion: Late graft failure is a major issue for kidney-transplant recipients. If our hypothesis that minimizing CNI
exposure with Campath-based induction therapy and/or an elective conversion to sirolimus-based maintenance
therapy can improve long-term graft function and survival is correct, then patients should experience better graft
function for longer. A positive outcome could change clinical practice in kidney transplantation.

Background
Kidney transplantation is well established as the best
treatment for patients with end-stage renal failure [1].
Despite significant advances in short-term graft survival
over the past two decades, these have not been matched
by improved long-term graft survival [2]. Long-term
graft survival has many implications both for individual
patients (who generally enjoy a better quality of life than
when on dialysis) and for healthcare providers (after the
initial cost surrounding the operation, the cost of
maintaining a graft is less than that of dialysis). The
1-year graft survival rates are now more than 90%, so
there is considerable interest in strategies that can
maximize the life span of renal transplants.
There are many potential causes of late graft failure,
with the most common being interstitial fibrosis/tubular
atrophy (IF/TA) [3]. IF/TA is believed to be the end
result of various types of graft damage, including preser￾vation damage, rejection, calcineurin inhibitor (CNI)
toxicity, hypertensive vascular disease, and viral infec￾tion. Functional studies significantly underestimate the
incidence of histological graft injury, with one study
showing that 94% of grafts had histological evidence of
IF/TA at one year [4]. This same study concluded that
much of the chronic damage is due to CNI toxicity, even
though the levels of these drugs in the study had been
maintained within the target range. For this reason,
many recent studies have focused on reducing exposure
to CNIs, and these have generally shown that this strat￾egy produces better medium-term outcomes (for ex￾ample, graft function at 1 year) [5]. There are two
potential strategies to minimize CNI exposure: more po￾tent induction therapy could be used safely to allow dose
reduction or avoidance of CNIs, or CNIs could be re￾placed by a different class of immunosuppressant that is
less likely to damage the kidney.
Campath is a potent induction agent
Campath (alemtuzumab) is a humanized monoclonal
antibody directed against CD52, and causes depletion of
lymphocytes. It was first studied in kidney transplant￾ation as a potential treatment for acute rejection. In a
small non-randomized pilot study of 12 patients, it
appeared to be effective, but was associated with severe in￾fective episodes [6]. The dosage was revised from seven
daily doses of 10 mg each to five daily doses of 6 mg each,
and no further severe infections occurred in the five pa￾tients who received the less potent regimen. It has since
been used as induction therapy in many centers; over
1,500 transplants in the USA received Campath induction
during the 2-year period of 2003 to 2004 [7].
Until recently there have been very few data on the
safety and efficacy of Campath from randomized con￾trolled trials. A systematic review of Campath as
induction therapy identified five studies comparing
Campath with interleukin-2 receptor antagonist induc￾tion, and identified a significant reduction in the risk of
acute rejection (relative risk (RR) = 0.54; 95% confidence
interval (CI) 0.37 to 0.79), but no effect on short-term
graft survival (RR = 1.06; 95% CI 0.64 to 1.78) [8]. How￾ever, there were only 659 patients in total included in
these trials, so substantial uncertainty remains over the
efficacy and safety of Campath. The largest trial to date
was the INTAC (Induction with TACrolimus) trial,
which compared Campath with basiliximab in 335 low￾risk patients (defined by non-black ethnicity, first trans￾plant, and panel reactive antibody (PRA) level <20) [9].
At 1 year, the rate of biopsy-proven acute rejection was
3% in participants allocated Campath versus 22% in
those allocated basiliximab (P<0.001). There was a small
excess risk of serious infection in participants allocated
Campath (57 versus 38 events, P = 0.02), but not of any
infection (129 versus 123 events, P = 0.17). However, the
INTAC trial did not attempt to spare CNI after
Campath: all participants received the same maintenance
immunosuppression of tacrolimus (target trough con￾centration 7 to 14 ng/ml for 6 months then reducing to
4 to 12 ng/ml), mycophenolate mofetil (2 g/day) and
corticosteroids (1 g or less prednisolone equivalent dur￾ing the first 5 days), so substantial uncertainty remains
over the safety and efficacy of Campath as part of a
CNI-minimization strategy.
Sirolimus as a potential replacement for calcineurin
inhibitors
Sirolimus is a macrocyclic lactone, and has a different
mechanism of action to CNIs. It blocks the mammalian
target of rapamycin pathway, thus inhibiting cellular
proliferation. Sirolimus has been used in a variety of
strategies for kidney transplantation. It was initially used
de novo (in conjunction with ciclosporin) but is not as
effective as CNIs during the high-risk post-operative
period, and the doses required to prevent rejection
(including a high loading dose) were associated with un￾acceptable adverse effects [10]. Trials of late conversion
to sirolimus failed to show any benefit [11], but more
recently trials of early (that is, within 3 to 6 months
post-transplant) conversion to sirolimus have shown po￾tential. The CONCEPT study randomized 192 kidney￾transplant recipients to remain on a ciclosporin-based
regimen or to switch to a sirolimus-based regimen at 3
months after transplantation. The patients allocated to
sirolimus had better graft function at 1 year compared
with the ciclosporin-allocated group (Cockcroft-Gault
glomerular filtration rate 68.9 versus 64.4 ml/min,
P=0.017) with no significant excess of acute rejection
[12]. A similarly designed study using everolimus (initi￾ated at 4.5 months post-transplant) in 300 patients also
Haynes et al. Transplantation Research 2013, 2:7 Page 2 of 9
http://www.transplantationresearch.com/content/2/1/7

showed a highly significant increase in eGFR at 1 year
after transplant (eGFR 71.8 versus 61.9 ml/min/1.73m2
,
P<0.0001) [13]. The benefits appear to be durable in the
medium term [14], but whether these translate into dif￾ferences in clinical outcomes such as graft failure re￾mains uncertain.
Campath and sirolimus in tolerance
The combination of Campath and sirolimus may enable
exposure to CNIs to be reduced or eliminated. This
could be favorable because CNIs are nephrotoxic and
may interfere with tolerogenesis [15]. It is known that
ischemia-reperfusion injury occurring during organ im￾plantation enhances the activation of the immune sys￾tem [16]. Depleting induction agents profoundly reduce
the number of circulating lymphocytes capable of
mounting an immune response during this period. It has
been suggested that by the time the peripheral lympho￾cytes return, the graft may have recovered from the in￾jury, and will therefore be immunologically quiescent
[17]. Studies examining the use of Campath followed by
either tacrolimus [18] or sirolimus [19] monotherapy
have had encouraging results, consistent with (but not
yet proving) the concept of donor-specific hyporespon￾siveness suggested by Calne when he proposed the term
prope (almost) tolerance [20].
Sirolimus is also potentially tolerogenic; it increases
the number of CD4+ cells with a regulatory phenotype
(Treg cells) [21]. Treg cells dampen the effector re￾sponse to antigenic challenge and are a crucial element
of peripheral tolerance. Furthermore, in addition to its
effects on tolerance-promoting Treg cells, sirolimus
facilitates the deletion of effector alloreactive T cells [22].
In combination, Campath and sirolimus have been
shown to induce donor-specific hyporesponsiveness, as
assessed by in vitro tests [23]. This is obviously encour￾aging, and merits further investigation.
Based on these observations, we have designed a clin￾ical trial with the purpose of testing whether Campath
and/or sirolimus can improve long-term outcomes after
kidney transplantation.
Methods/Design
Basic protocol overview
The 3C Study is an open-label, randomized multi-center
trial comparing 1) Campath-based and basiliximab￾based induction therapy strategies; and 2) from about 6
months after transplantation, sirolimus-based and
tacrolimus-based maintenance therapy strategies. The
study is planned to take about 7 years, with recruitment
of the 852 participants taking 2 years, followed by a
5-year follow-up period.
Participants will be randomly allocated to receive either
Campath-based or basiliximab-based induction therapy
before transplantation. All participants will then receive 6
months of tacrolimus-based maintenance therapy before
being randomized again (if they remain willing and eli￾gible) to either sirolimus-based or tacrolimus-based long￾term maintenance therapy (Figure 1).
Inclusion criteria
The 3C Study includes all patients eligible for kidney
transplantation, including those receiving kidneys from
deceased donors (brain or circulatory death) and living
donors, as well as highly sensitized (defined as calculated
reaction frequency >85%) and previously transplanted
recipients. The specific inclusion criteria are recipients
of a kidney-only transplant aged over 18 years.
Exclusion criteria
Patients will be excluded if they: are pregnant; are receiv￾ing multi-organ transplants (including kidney-pancreas
transplants); have previously been treated with Campath;
have active infection including HIV or viral hepatitis; have
a history of anaphylaxis to humanized monoclonal
antibodies; have a history of malignancy (except non￾melanoma skin cancer) that was diagnosed or recurred in
the previous 5 years; have lost a previous kidney transplant
within 6 months not due to technical reasons; or have a
medical history that might limit their ability to take trial
treatments for the duration of the study.
Participants are eligible for the maintenance therapy
randomization (sirolimus or tacrolimus) if: 1) at about 6
months after transplantation, their urine protein excre￾tion rate is below 800 mg/day (urine protein:creatinine
ratio <80 mg/mmol or albumin:creatinine ratio <50 mg/
mmol); and 2) they have not had biopsy-proven acute
rejection (Banff grade >1) in the previous 30 days.
Study objectives
The primary aims of the 3C Study are to assess the differ￾ences in 1) biopsy-proven acute rejection among partici￾pants allocated Campath-based versus basiliximab-based
induction therapy (assessed at 6 months); and 2) graft
function among all those allocated tacrolimus-based ver￾sus sirolimus-based maintenance therapy (assessed at 2
years after transplantation).
Secondary aims include assessments of the study treat￾ments (Campath versus basiliximab, and tacrolimus ver￾sus sirolimus) on: 1) graft-related outcomes (including
graft survival, rates of biopsy-proven rejection); and 2)
safety outcomes (including infection [particularly oppor￾tunistic infections], malignancy and overall survival).
Randomization and treatment scheme
Participants will be randomized by an internet-based sys￾tem before transplantation. After the participant is regis￾tered on the internet-based system, they are assigned a
Haynes et al. Transplantation Research 2013, 2:7 Page 3 of 9
http://www.transplantationresearch.com/content/2/1/7

unique identifier (participant ID), and once randomized,
the assigned treatment group is displayed on the screen.
Participants assigned Campath-based induction will re￾ceive Campath 30 mg (intravenously or subcutaneously)
after reperfusion of the transplant (and a further 30 mg 24
hours later if they are ≤60 years old). Before the first dose
of Campath, patients will be given 500 mg methylprednis￾olone and 10 mg chlorphenamine intravenously, but no
further steroids will be given. Maintenance oral immuno￾suppression will consist of mycophenolate sodium (360
mg twice daily) and tacrolimus (starting at 2 mg twice
daily from day 3, aiming for target trough concentration 5
to 7 ng/ml). After 12 months, the mycophenolate sodium
dose will be reduced to 180 mg twice daily. Participants
assigned basiliximab-based induction will receive 20 mg
basiliximab intravenously pre-operatively and on day 4,
oral mycophenolate sodium (540 to 720 mg twice daily)
and oral tacrolimus (0.05 to 0.10 mg/kg twice daily, aiming
for target trough concentration 5 to 12 ng/ml). Patients
will be given 500 mg methylprednisolone intravenously
pre-reperfusion and maintenance oral corticosteroids,
starting at 15 to 20 mg prednisolone, to be reduced or
withdrawn completely in accordance with local practice
(avoiding complete withdrawal 5 to 7 months post￾transplantation; that is, around the time of the mainten￾ance therapy randomization).
Participants can enter the maintenance-therapy rando￾mization between 5 to 7 months after transplantation, as￾suming no exclusion criteria apply. Participants allocated
tacrolimus-based maintenance therapy will continue their
current therapy and the target trough concentration is 5
to 7 ng/ml in all participants. Participants assigned
sirolimus-based maintenance therapy will stop tacrolimus
after an evening dose and start sirolimus the next morning
at 3 mg daily (unless they weigh <60 kg, when 2 mg daily
will be used). Target trough concentration is 6 to 12 ng/ml
for the first 6 months, then reducing to 5 to 10 ng/ml. Ad￾vice will be given on mouth, care and a short course of
low-dose prednisolone can be used to cover the conver￾sion period if the local investigator considers it necessary.
Mycophenolic acid levels are not routinely monitored in
the UK, so are not specified in this protocol.
Both randomizations use a minimization algorithm
that ensures balance for recipient age, ethnicity, type
of transplant, human leukocyte antigen mismatch,
sensitization status (and for maintenance randomization,
allocated induction therapy).
Other treatments (including cytomegalovirus and
Pneumocystis prophylaxis) will be left to the discretion
of the local investigator. A summary of the treatment
scheme and flow of participants through the trial is
shown in Figure 1.

Follow-up and documentation
During the first year after transplantation, all participants
will be followed up at discharge after transplantation and
at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after transplantation. Data will
be collected on all serious adverse events (which include
all episodes of rejection and opportunistic infection for
the purposes of this study), current medication (including
doses of immunosuppressive drugs), non-serious adverse
events considered to be related to one of the study treat￾ments, along with blood pressure and weight, and relevant
laboratory values (including serum creatinine, full blood
count, lipid profile, and urine protein/albumin to creatin￾ine ratio). Data will also be collected on healthcare usage
and quality of life to allow health economic analyses to be
conducted.
On a yearly basis, all participants will be sent an an￾nual questionnaire to collect information on serious ad￾verse events, study treatments, healthcare usage, and
quality of life. In addition, all participants will be flagged
with a number of national registries so that their rou￾tinely collected data can be used for long-termfollow-up.
These registries include the UK Transplant Registry
(which collects data on graft survival and function),
Office for National Statistics (which collects data on
death), National Health Service (NHS) Information
Centre (which collects data on cancer), and the Hospital
Episode Statistics registry (which collects data on all
hospital admissions).
Endpoint definition
The primary endpoint of the induction therapy compari￾son will be biopsy-proven acute rejection during the first
6 months after transplantation. The Banff classification
definition (including those of the various subtypes) will be
used. The histological appearances of cellular rejection
after depleting induction with alemtuzumab are usually
typical (despite the profound lymphopenia) [24]. All re￾ports of rejection (including events that may yield a diag￾nosis of rejection (for example, transplant biopsy) will be
adjudicated by trained clinicians, blinded to study treat￾ment allocation, at the coordinating center. The date of
the rejection will be the date of the diagnostic biopsy.
The primary endpoint of the maintenance therapy
comparison will be change in graft function (estimated
using the four-variable Modification of Diet in Renal
Disease (MDRD) formula [25]) from 6 months to 2 years
after transplantation.
Secondary endpoints for both comparisons will include
safety outcomes (including infection and cancer) and
long-term outcomes (including graft and patient survival).
Trial organization
The 3C Study is an investigator-initiated trial. Preliminary
investigator meetings were organized by the University of
Oxford, which is the sponsor of the study. The trial is
funded by grants from the UK National Health Service
Blood and Transplant Research and Development fund,
Pfizer (Collegeville, PA, USA), and Novartis UK.
Participating centers
Major kidney transplant centers from the UK (18 sites in
total) will be participating in the study. Such a collabor￾ation is required in order to recruit the planned number
of kidney-transplant patients needed to provide statisti￾cally reliable and clinically meaningful results.
Drug supply
Study drugs will be purchased by participating hospitals,
and the Campath will be relabeled by local hospital
pharmacies in accordance with the EU Clinical Trial
Directive. The other investigation medicinal products
(basiliximab, tacrolimus, and sirolimus) will be exempt
from the EU Clinical Trial Directive requirements for
labeling and accountability, as they will be used within
the terms of the marketing authorization. All treatments
will be used on an open-label basis.
Monitoring
Before recruitment started, all sites were visited by the
sponsor in order to train the relevant staff in the study
procedures. Recruitment rates and completeness of
follow-up data will be monitored closely by the sponsor.
Sites will be monitored during recruitment and follow￾up through a combination of on-site visits from the
sponsor and central statistical monitoring. An independ￾ent data monitoring committee (DMC) has been con￾vened (see below).
Ethics and safety
The most recently approved version of the protocol is
version 5, which was approved by the Nottingham 2 Re￾search Ethics Committee on 28 February 2012. Trust
management approval has been granted by each trans￾plant center. The 3C Study complies with the principles
of Good Clinical Practice. Written informed consent will
be obtained from each participant before randomization,
after a discussion with the local investigator or their nomi￾nated deputy. Unblinded interim analyses of all relevant
data will be reviewed twice a year by the independent
DMC, which can advise the study steering committee if
the study protocol needs to be amended in any way, or if
they recommend early termination of the study.
Sample size
The sample size for the 3C Study was determined by the
maintenance therapy allocation. A meta-analysis of the
effect of conversion to sirolimus-based maintenance
therapy showed an improvement in eGFR of 6.4 ml/
Haynes et al. Transplantation Research 2013, 2:7 Page 5 of 9
http://www.transplantationresearch.com/content/2/1/7

min/1.73m2 (95% CI 1.9 to 11) in the group assigned to
sirolimus [26]. The trials included in that meta-analysis
varied in duration, with most patients followed up for 1
year. If these differences were maintained, it would be
reasonable to anticipate a 10 ml/min/1.73m2 difference
in eGFR 2 years after conversion to sirolimus (that is,
median follow-up at least 2.5 years after transplantation).
We assumed that the adherence to sirolimus therapy
would be around 75% (that is, approximately 25% of
patients allocated sirolimus in randomized trials discon￾tinue it [26]), and further it was estimated that about
two-thirds of participants would be willing and eligible
to be randomized at 6 months after transplantation.
Thus, of 800 patients entering the study, about 530
(two-thirds) would be re-randomized at 6 months. This
number of participants would provide excellent power
(>90%) with α = 0.05 and good power (>80%) with
α = 0.01 to detect such a difference (even if adherence
to allocated treatment was only 75%). If the self￾correlation between baseline eGFR (that is, before
re-randomization at 6 months) and eGFR 2 years later is
>0.5, then comparing the change from baseline in eGFR
will provide even better power for these analyses.
Having 800 patients would also provide good power
(90%) with α = 0.05 to detect a halving in the acute rejec￾tion rate at 6 months (from 15% to 7.5%), which is the
primary comparison in the induction-therapy comparison.
Statistical evaluation
The primary endpoint of the induction-therapy compari￾son (biopsy-proven acute rejection occurring before
maintenance-therapy randomization or at 6 months
post-transplant (whichever occurs first) will be com￾pared using the log-rank test, with average event rate
ratios derived using standard methods [27]. Secondary
endpoints of the induction-therapy comparison will be
analyzed in an exploratory manner, as there is a poten￾tial for bias in endpoints that occur after the main￾tenance-therapy randomization (if inclusion in the
maintenance-therapy comparison is not balanced be￾tween the two induction-therapy groups).
The statistical analysis of the primary endpoint of the
maintenance treatment will depend on the self￾correlation of eGFR at baseline (that is, at randomization
into the maintenance comparison) and at 2 years. This
will be performed by investigators blinded to treatment
allocation and, if the self-correlation is >0.5, the analysis
will be of the difference in the mean change from base￾line between the two groups using analysis of covariance
methods, as this will provide greater power for the ana￾lysis (analyses of other datasets suggests this is likely,
but if the self-correlation is less than 0.5 then the ana￾lysis will be of the difference in mean eGFR at 2 years).
All analyses will be intention to treat, and will include
all randomized participants who are transplanted. The
small number of participants who are randomized but
not transplanted will be censored at day 0 for the pur￾poses of analysis.
Secondary endpoints for which time-to-event data are
available will be compared with the log-rank test,
whereas other categorical endpoints will be compared
with χ2 tests. Continuous variables will be compared
with t-tests (after logarithmic transformation if necessary
for skewed variables). Tertiary endpoints (that is, sub￾group analyses of the primary endpoint in different types
of participants) will be interpreted cautiously, as the
power to detect true differences between subgroups will
be limited. Subgroups will be compared by testing for
heterogeneity of the treatment effect across subgroups.
Discussion
Late graft loss (that is, more than 1 year after transplant￾ation) is a major issue for kidney-transplant recipients.
Despite improvements in short-term graft survival, long￾term graft survival has not improved substantially [2].
The commonest reason for such late graft failure is IF/
TA. Data from serial protocol biopsies previously sug￾gested that CNI nephrotoxicity was an important cause
of IF/TA [4], although this has been debated more re￾cently [28,29]. Previous CNI minimization studies have
not been large enough or of sufficient duration to detect
benefits in terms of long-term graft function and sur￾vival. Two potential strategies to reduce exposure to
CNIs are Campath as a more potent induction therapy,
and conversion to a sirolimus-based maintenance regi￾men. Given the favorable effects of both treatments on
markers of tolerance [30], the 3C Study has been
designed to test both strategies to investigate whether
they could improve both short-term and long-term
outcomes.
The 3C Study deliberately includes a wide range of
kidney-transplant recipients. as all transplants are vul￾nerable to the nephrotoxic effects of CNIs, and it is im￾portant to ensure that the results will be applicable to as
many kidney-transplant recipients as possible. Many
previous trials have only included low-risk transplant re￾cipients, and therefore uncertainty remains about the ap￾plicability of such treatments to higher-risk recipients.
Using broader exclusion criteria and conducting a small
number of carefully pre-specified subgroup analyses will
provide reliable information about whether any effect of
either strategy is modified by certain baseline character￾istics. One such key subgroup analysis will be whether
there is an interaction between the two randomizations;
for example, whether induction therapy based on
Campath modifies the treatment effect (possibly by
improving compliance) of sirolimus-based maintenance
therapy.

The protocol is intended to be pragmatic and easy to
implement at local transplant centers. Considerable
effort has been made to make the control treatment as
similar to current European practice as possible to
ensure that centers would be willing to deliver it to par￾ticipants and to ensure that the results will be relevant
to current practice. Prednisolone withdrawal, precise
mycophenolate dosing, and infection prophylaxis will be
left to the local investigator’s discretion, in order to limit
the effects of the study on routine practice and thus
facilitate recruitment. 852 participants have been ran￾domized into the study (of whom 355 have been
re-randomized into the maintenance comparison at the
time of submission). The safety analysis (once all partici￾pants have completed the 1-year follow-up) will there￾fore be conducted in early 2014.
An important and novel aspect of the 3C Study design
is linkage with registries. In the UK, data will be rou￾tinely collected on patient survival and certified cause of
death (by the Office for National Statistics), cancer inci￾dence (by the NHS Information Centre), hospital admis￾sion or outpatient evaluation (by the Hospital Episode
Statistics registry), and transplant function, rejection and
survival (by the UK Transplant registry). Specific
approval to flag all 3C Study participants with these
registries has been obtained, and these will therefore
provide a cost-efficient means of collecting data on all
the relevant outcomes for the lifetime of the participant
(unless they withdraw consent). It will therefore be pos￾sible to investigate the very long-term effects of the
study treatments reliably at reasonable cost. For ex￾ample, graft failure and cancer (with the possible excep￾tion of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder) will
be uncommon during the first few years after transplant￾ation, when most studies cease follow-up. However, the
3C Study will continue follow-up for many more years,
and therefore will accrue substantially more events and
thus allow more reliable conclusions to be drawn.
