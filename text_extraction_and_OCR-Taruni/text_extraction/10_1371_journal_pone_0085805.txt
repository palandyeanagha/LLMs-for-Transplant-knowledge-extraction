Abstract
Background: An association between testosterone therapy (TT) and cardiovascular disease has been reported and TT use is
increasing rapidly.
Methods: We conducted a cohort study of the risk of acute non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) following an initial TT
prescription (N = 55,593) in a large health-care database. We compared the incidence rate of MI in the 90 days following the
initial prescription (post-prescription interval) with the rate in the one year prior to the initial prescription (pre-prescription
interval) (post/pre). We also compared post/pre rates in a cohort of men prescribed phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors
(PDE5I; sildenafil or tadalafil, N = 167,279), and compared TT prescription post/pre rates with the PDE5I post/pre rates,
adjusting for potential confounders using doubly robust estimation.
Results: In all subjects, the post/pre-prescription rate ratio (RR) for TT prescription was 1.36 (1.03, 1.81). In men aged 65
years and older, the RR was 2.19 (1.27, 3.77) for TT prescription and 1.15 (0.83, 1.59) for PDE5I, and the ratio of the rate ratios
(RRR) for TT prescription relative to PDE5I was 1.90 (1.04, 3.49). The RR for TT prescription increased with age from 0.95 (0.54,
1.67) for men under age 55 years to 3.43 (1.54, 7.56) for those aged $75 years (ptrend = 0.03), while no trend was seen for
PDE5I (ptrend = 0.18). In men under age 65 years, excess risk was confined to those with a prior history of heart disease, with
RRs of 2.90 (1.49, 5.62) for TT prescription and 1.40 (0.91, 2.14) for PDE5I, and a RRR of 2.07 (1.05, 4.11).
Discussion: In older men, and in younger men with pre-existing diagnosed heart disease, the risk of MI following initiation
of TT prescription is substantially increased.

Introduction
Testosterone therapy (TT) has been used in healthy older men
to treat diminished extremity strength and physical function
associated an age-related decline in serum testosterone. [1]
Recently TT has been increasing extraordinarily rapidly, includ￾ing among younger men and among those without hormone
measurement, suggesting that the indications for prescription have
likely markedly expanded. [2,3] Three recent studies have raised
some concerns about possible adverse cardiovascular outcomes
associated with TT. In 2010 a small randomized trial of
testosterone gel on muscle function in men 65 years of age or
older was discontinued due to an excess of a variety of
cardiovascular events in the testosterone arm. [4] This was
followed by a meta-analysis of a number of a number of very small
trials in predominantly older men which also suggested excess
cardiovascular risk. [5] Recently, a study in the Veteran’s
Administration health care system of men average age over 60,
80% of whom had documented coronary disease, reported an
excess of a category of events that included death and
cardiovascular disease in those receiving TT. [6] In the two
studies assessing timing of the increase, it was noted to appear very
soon following initiation of therapy. [4,5] While this has raised
public health concerns [2,5,7], significant questions remain. In all
3 studies, combined cardiovascular disease endpoints were used
since individual outcomes, particularly severe events, were too few
to evaluate. Perhaps because of this, or for other factors, the point
estimates of risks were also divergent among the studies, with
hazard ratios ranging from less than 1.3 to greater than 5.0. All of
these studies also recognized the importance of evaluating risk
among those men with and without preexisting heart disease, but
did not have sufficient numbers of subjects to adequately assess this
issue. All three studies were also predominantly of older men, and
unable to address risks in younger men where the increases in

prescriptions have been the most dramatic. Therefore, using a
large healthcare database, we evaluated the hypotheses that TT
might increase the risk of acute non-fatal myocardial infarction
(MI), and that this effect might also be particularly strong in those
with pre-existing cardiac disease. We also explored whether these
same effects might apply to younger men as well.
Methods
Data Source
The Truven Health MarketScanH Commercial Claims and
Encounters Database includes employees, dependents and retirees
with commercial or Medicare insurance whose employers license
healthcare data to Truven Health Analytics (Truven). The
MarketScan data contributors include Fortune 500 employers
(60 percent) and health plans covering numerous other companies
and unions (40 percent). The data include diagnoses, procedures,
and prescriptions for all enrollees. Enrollees in 2011 are distributed
regionally within the U.S. as Northeast (24 percent), North Central
(37 percent), South (20 percent), and West (19 percent). We used
the data from 2006 to 2010, including patient-specific enrollment
history, year of birth, gender, inpatient and outpatient diagnoses
(ICD-9 codes) and treatments, and outpatient prescriptions. [8] No
data were available on indications for TT prescription, race,
laboratory findings, occupational, environmental, or lifestyle
factors.
The data for the study were hosted in secure facilities of
Consolidated Research, Inc. (CRI), as required by the Agreement
between CRI (Los Angeles, California) and Truven Health
Analytics (Ann Arbor, Michigan). We received IRB exemption
for this study from the NIH Office of Human Subjects Research
Protections (OHSRP) since the study was conducted in claims data
that were anonymized or de-identified by Truven prior to release.
The database is available from Truven under licensing agreements
similar to ours.
Cohort Formation
We formed cohorts from the database from men with a
minimum of 22 months of continuous enrollment for analyses with
post-prescription follow-up intervals of 90 days, and 25 months for
analyses with post prescription follow-up intervals of 91 to
180 days. From this cohort, we selected men who filled a first
prescription for any of several TT prescriptions not containing
estrogen (N = 55,593) and, for a comparison population, men who
filled a first prescription for phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors
(PDE5I; sildenafil or tadalafil, N = 167,279), between January 1,
2008 and September 30, 2010. We did not have data on how
much of the prescribed medication was consumed. The most
common TT prescriptions were testosterone gel, testosterone
micronized, testosterone cypionate, and testosterone transdermal
system. We selected men receiving PDE5I prescriptions as a
comparison group because some indications for prescription are
similar to those for TT prescription. In addition, PDE5I is
commonly prescribed to older men, does not have androgenic
effects, and is not metabolized to other sex steroid hormones, such
as dihydrotestosterone or estrogens. Also, while PDE5I is
recommended for men healthy enough to engage in sexual
activity, the drugs themselves, after extensive scrutiny, have not
been associated with adverse cardiovascular events [9].
The covariates were those recorded in the 18 to 12 month
interval prior to the initial prescription for TT prescription or
PDE5I. The pre-prescription interval was the one year prior to the
initial prescription, the post-prescription interval was 90 days
following the initial prescription, thus the prescription cohorts
were restricted to those men with a minimum of 18 months
enrollment prior to and three months after their initial prescrip￾tion. In the post-prescription interval, patients were followed until
a diagnosis of acute non-fatal myocardial infarction, refilled first
prescription, or 90 days following initial prescription, whichever
occurred first.
For those who did not refill their initial prescription, we
analyzed an additional 90-day interval (91–180 days post￾prescription), a time when this group likely had minimal use of
these drugs. A refill and a subsequent prescription were treated
equally in the analysis. Patients with first prescriptions for both TT
prescription and PDE5I during follow-up were excluded from this
analysis.
Outcome
The study outcome was a diagnosis of acute MI (ICD-9: 410).
Men with a history of MI prior to the first prescription for TT or
PDE5I were excluded from the post-prescription analyses.
Covariates
Age at the time of initial prescription was included as a
covariate. Diagnostic covariates were identified by the ICD 9
codes recorded for inpatient or outpatient diagnoses, reported to
be associated with MI, [10] including angina, arrhythmia, heart
disease, prior MI, heart failure, hypertension, hyperlipidemia,
stroke, peripheral vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease,

inhibitors (SSRIs), corticosteroids, insulin, diuretics, and anti￾diabetes drugs. All of these were included for analysis, but we
restrict descriptive tabulations included in the manuscript to
exposures that were $2%. Full descriptive tabulations are
provided as supplementary material.
Analyses
We examined risk of MI with TT prescription in all subjects.
Since previous studies indicated that cardiovascular events
appeared early in treatment, we focused on the 90 day interval
following the filling of a first prescription. For those who did not
refill their prescription, we also assessed the interval of 91–
180 days. To examine potential effect modification by pre-existing
disease, we estimated the effect of TT prescription by prior history
of a heart disease diagnosis (ICD-9: 404, 414–414.07, 420–429).
We also examined the RR for PDE5I and compared the RRs in
the TT prescription and PDE5I cohorts.
Statistical Methods
We examined the effect of the medications by estimating the
ratio of the MI incidence rate in the post-prescription interval to
the MI incidence rate in the pre-prescription interval (post/pre
RR). To estimate the effect of TT prescription relative to PDE5I,
we weighted the PDE5I patients with weights derived from
propensity scores, specifically their estimated odds of being
prescribed TT prescription rather than PDE5I. [11] This
weighting aligns the distribution in the comparison cohort of the
variables used in the prescription-probability model to match the
distribution in the TT prescription cohort. These weights were
then used in a Poisson regression model for the MI rate to obtain
doubly robust estimates of effect. [12] These estimates are
unconfounded by the adjustment variables if the prescription￾odds model or the outcome-regression model is specified correctly.
[13] To the extent that either model is approximately correct, any
channeling bias due to the adjustment variables would be removed
by this adjustment process. [13] In addition, we computed the
weights so that they would result in equal pre-prescription MI
incidence rates in the TT and PDE5I cohorts.

We also estimated the ratio of rate ratios (RRR). [13] The
numerator of the RRR is the rate ratio for TT prescription relative
to PDE5I in the post-prescription interval, and the denominator is
the rate ratio for TT prescription relative to the PDE5I in the pre￾prescription interval. This measure adjusts the post-prescription
rate ratio for the corresponding rate ratio in the pre-prescription
interval, and also controls for any differences in ascertainment
between the pre- and post-prescription periods. It is intended to
account for otherwise uncontrolled differences in the baseline rates
of the cohorts. We estimated RRR from a Poisson regression
model with MI as the outcome, log-exposure time as an offset, a
drug indicator, and the patient features listed above. Since pre￾prescription rates were weighted to be identical, the coefficient of
the product of the indicator variables for the prescription type is
the natural logarithm of RRR. All statistical analyses were
conducted using the STARx and SAS software packages (STARx,
CRI, Los Angeles, California, SAS 9.2, SAS Institute Inc., Cary,
NC).
Results
For all TT prescription subjects combined, the post/pre
prescription rate ratio for MI (RR)was 1.36 (1.03, 1.81) (Table 1).
In men aged 65 years and older the RR was 2.19 (1.27, 3.77),
while in men under age 65 years the RR was 1.17 (0.84, 1.63). The
difference in RR between men 65 and older and those under 65
reflects a broader trend of increasing RR with increasing age. The
RRs were 0.95 (0.54, 1.67) under 55 years, 1.35 (0.77, 2.38) at 55–
59, 1.29 (0.71, 2.35) at 60–64, 1.35 (0.44, 4.18) at 65–69, 1.62
(0.51, 5.16) at 70–74, and 3.43 (1.54, 7.66) at 75 years and older
(ptrend= 0.03). Men aged 65 years and older, whose follow-up was
not right-censored because they did not refill their prescription,
were followed for an additional 90 day period (91–180 days post￾prescription) during which the RR was 0.98 (0.43, 2.23). In men
under age 65 the corresponding RR was 1.15 (0.79, 1.68).
For the comparison group of PDE5I users, the baseline
distributions of prior cardiovascular diagnoses, risk factors, and
medication use were less common than in the TT prescription
cohort, but after weighting, the distributions of covariates in each
prescription cohort were nearly identical (Table 2). This procedure
also resulted in the same adjusted pre-prescription rates of MI in
both prescription groups: 3.48 per 1,000 person-years (PY). The
adjusted post/pre RR for PDE5I across all ages was 1.08 (0.93,
1.24) (Table 3). When the data were stratified into ages 65 years
and older and less than age 65 years, weighting also achieved
nearly identical distributions of the covariates between the TT and
PDE5I cohorts for each age group (Tables S1 and S2). In men
aged 65 years and older, the adjusted RR for PDE5I was 1.15
(0.83, 1.59), and in those under age 65 years it was 1.06 (0.91,
1.24) (Table 3). The adjusted ratio of the rate ratios (RRRs)
comparing those for TT prescription to those for PDE5I were 1.27
(0.94, 1.71) for all subjects, 1.90 (1.04, 3.49) for those aged 65 years
and older and 1.10 (0.78, 1.56) for those under age 65.
The data for both prescription groups were also divided into
men with a previously recorded diagnosis of any heart disease, and
those without (Table 4). For TT prescription, in men under age 65
years, the RR was 2.90 (1.49, 5.62) for those with a history of heart
disease and 0.90 (0.61, 1.34) for those without. In men aged
65 year and older, the RR was 2.16 (0.92, 5.10) for those with a
history of heart disease and 2.21 (1.09, 4.45) for those without. The
comparable RRs for PDE5I for those under age 65 years were
1.40 (0.91, 2.14) with a history of heart disease and 0.99 (0.84,
1.17) for those without. For PDE5I among those aged 65 years and
older, the RR was 1.13 (0.68, 1.88) for men with a history of heart
disease, and 0.92 (0.60, 1.39) for those without. The corresponding
RRRs for TT prescription compared to PDE5I were 2.07 (1.05,
4.11) for those under age 65 years with a history of heart disease
and 0.91 (0.60, 1.37) for those without, and 1.90 (0.66, 5.50) for
those aged 65 years and older with a history of heart disease, and
2.41 (1.12, 5.17) for those without.
As odds-of-treatment weighting is less familiar than unweighted
regression methods, we also examined the effect of controlling for
the covariates using an unweighted Poisson regression. In subjects
aged 65 years and older, the RRR was 2.27 (1.17, 4.43), about 20
percent higher than the weighted estimate of 1.90, and in those
under age 65 years with a history of heart disease, the RRR was
2.33 (1.01, 5.35), about 13 percent higher than the weighted
estimate of 2.07. The lower estimates suggest that weighting in the
primary analysis helped reduce possible upward confounding.
Discussion
Among men aged 65 years and older, we observed a two-fold
increase in the risk of MI in the 90 days after filling an initial TT
prescription, the risk declined to baseline in the 91 to 180 days
after initial TT prescription, among those who did not refill their
prescription. Since we censored follow-up at the first refill, and the
supply for most prescriptions was 30 to 90 days, it is likely that
there was little use of the medication in the 91 to 180 day post￾prescription interval when the risk declined. Thus, the pattern of
change in risk by supply of testosterone is consistent with an effect
of the drug, and underscores the concerns raised by three recent
studies in predominantly older men [4–6].
Among younger men with a history of heart disease, we
observed a two to three-fold increased risk of MI in the 90 days
following an initial TT prescription and no excess risk in younger
men without such a history. Among older men, the two-fold
increased risk was associated with TT prescription regardless of
cardiovascular disease history, although this analysis was based on
Table 3. Rates of myocardial infarction per 1,000 persons per
year (PY) in men under age 65 years and those age 65 years
and older, in pre- and post-prescription intervals for an initial
prescription for PDE5I with adjusted* rate ratios (RR), and 95%
confidence intervals (CI).

relatively small numbers of MI cases in each subgroup. More
relevant perhaps is the rapid increase with age in the prevalence of
diagnosed and undiagnosed coronary artery disease reported from
autopsy studies, both overall and among accident victims, [14,15]
so that advanced age may be a more sensitive indicator of
coronary disease prevalence than prior diagnoses. The recent
study of TT within the VA healthcare system detected no change
in the rate ratio for TT and coronary disease in the presence of
existing coronary disease (‘‘interaction’’ P = 0.41) [6]. However,
since that study had less than 200 men with normal coronary
arteries, they likely had insufficient statistical precision to address
this question. Overall, our own findings appear consistent with a
higher frequency of thrombotic events following TT prescription
among men with more extensive coronary vascular disease.
Our findings are consistent with a recent meta-analysis of
placebo-controlled randomized trials of testosterone therapy
lasting 12 or more weeks among mainly older men, which
reported that testosterone therapy increased the risk of adverse
cardiovascular-related events (OR = 1.54, 95%CI:1.09, 2.18), as
well as serious adverse cardiovascular-related events (OR = 1.61,
95%CI:1.01, 2.56) which included myocardial infarction along
with other conditions. [5] This association appeared unrelated to
average baseline testosterone level (p = 0.70) but varied by source
of funding (p = 0.03), with a stronger summary effect in a meta￾analysis of studies not funded by the pharmaceutical industry
(OR = 2.06, 95%CI:1.34, 3.17) compared with studies funded by
the pharmaceutical industry (OR = 0.89, 95%CI:0.50, 1.60). A

Testosterone Therapy and Myocardial Infarction
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 5 January 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e85805

androgen levels were deemed to be below normal physiological
levels (hypogonadism).
Taken together, the evidence supports an association between
testosterone therapy and risk of serious, adverse cardiovascular￾related events–including non-fatal myocardial infarction–in men.
However, there is some evidence that low endogenous testosterone
levels may also be positively associated with cardiovascular events
[16,17]. But, as extensively reviewed by Xu et al. [5], effects of
endogenous and exogenous testosterone may differ. Exogenous
testosterone (TT) is associated with physiologic changes that
predispose to clotting and thrombotic disorders including
increased blood pressure [18], polycythemia [19], reductions in
HDL cholesterol [18,20], and hyperviscosity of the blood and
platelet aggregation. [20–23]; TT also increases circulating
estrogens [24,25] which may play a role in the observed excess
of adverse cardiovascular-related events, given that estrogen
therapy has been associated with this excess in both men and
women. [26–29] The mechanisms linking estrogens to thrombotic
events may be related to markers of activated coagulation,
decreased coagulation inhibitors, and activated protein C resis￾tance [30].
Despite plausible biologic mechanisms linking TT prescription
to an elevated risk of MI, our study has limitations related to use of
a health-care database that did not include information on the
serologic or diagnostic indications for treatment. It also identified
only subjects with non-fatal MIs, typically representing about 75%
of the total incidence, and was based on the diagnosis of an
attending physician, rather than a structured evaluation as might
occur in a randomized trial. However, the accuracy of an MI
diagnosis is considered to be reliable in such databases, [31] and
the established risk factors for MI apply to both fatal and non-fatal
events. [32] We were also unable to examine whether this excess
was related to indications such as level of serum testosterone or
hypogonadism.
We addressed potential confounding from measured and
unmeasured risk factors by using each treated group as its own
control, comparing risk before versus after the start of medication
use during the short time-frame of our study, and by controlling
for differences in the prevalence of risk factors between the two
treatment groups. In the prescription-odds weighted regressions,
we found no association between PDE5I prescriptions and the risk
of MI, suggesting that the TT prescription-related risk of MI is
more likely a drug effect, rather than a result of behavioral or other
factors associated with prescription.
Furthermore, there is no reason to suspect that physicians
excluded high-risk individuals from TT prescription or monitored
them more closely, since the hypothesis relating TT prescription to
adverse cardiovascular events was not widely known during the
study period. Indeed, the initial prescription for over 90 percent of
the patients in our study occurred prior to publication of this
potential concern, [4] and subsequent prescribing information and
advertisements for these products have not referred to adverse
cardiovascular risks.
Further study is needed to examine the risk of a variety of
specific serious adverse cardiovascular events in relation to TT
dose and duration, and to assess if the risks of TT vary by level of
serum testosterone and presence or absence of hypogonadal
disease. The observed excess MI risk in younger men with a
history of heart disease is a particular public health concern, as
about 10 percent of the men in our study under age 65 years with
a TT prescription had a history of heart disease.
Given the rapidly increasing use of TT, the current results,
along with other recent findings emphasize the urgency of the
previous call for clinical trials adequately powered to assess the
range of benefits and risks suggested for such therapy. Until that
time clinicians might be well advised to include serious cardiovas￾cular events in their discussions with patients of potential risks,
particularly for men with existing cardiovascular disease.
