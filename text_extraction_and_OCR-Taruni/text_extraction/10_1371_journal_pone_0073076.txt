Abstract
Urine has long been a ‘‘favored’’ biofluid among metabolomics researchers. It is sterile, easy-to-obtain in large volumes,
largely free from interfering proteins or lipids and chemically complex. However, this chemical complexity has also made
urine a particularly difficult substrate to fully understand. As a biological waste material, urine typically contains metabolic
breakdown products from a wide range of foods, drinks, drugs, environmental contaminants, endogenous waste
metabolites and bacterial by-products. Many of these compounds are poorly characterized and poorly understood. In an
effort to improve our understanding of this biofluid we have undertaken a comprehensive, quantitative, metabolome-wide
characterization of human urine. This involved both computer-aided literature mining and comprehensive, quantitative
experimental assessment/validation. The experimental portion employed NMR spectroscopy, gas chromatography mass
spectrometry (GC-MS), direct flow injection mass spectrometry (DFI/LC-MS/MS), inductively coupled plasma mass
spectrometry (ICP-MS) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) experiments performed on multiple human
urine samples. This multi-platform metabolomic analysis allowed us to identify 445 and quantify 378 unique urine
metabolites or metabolite species. The different analytical platforms were able to identify (quantify) a total of: 209 (209) by
NMR, 179 (85) by GC-MS, 127 (127) by DFI/LC-MS/MS, 40 (40) by ICP-MS and 10 (10) by HPLC. Our use of multiple
metabolomics platforms and technologies allowed us to identify several previously unknown urine metabolites and to
substantially enhance the level of metabolome coverage. It also allowed us to critically assess the relative strengths and
weaknesses of different platforms or technologies. The literature review led to the identification and annotation of another
2206 urinary compounds and was used to help guide the subsequent experimental studies. An online database containing
the complete set of 2651 confirmed human urine metabolite species, their structures (3079 in total), concentrations, related
literature references and links to their known disease associations are freely available at http://www.urinemetabolome.ca.

Introduction
Metabolomics is a relatively young branch of ‘‘omics’’ science
concerned with the systematic study of the chemical products or
metabolites that cells and organisms generate. Because metabolites
are the downstream products of numerous genome-wide or
proteome-wide interactions, the metabolome (the sum of all
metabolites in an organism) can be a very sensitive measure of an
organism’s phenotype. This fact has made metabolomics partic￾ularly useful in the study of environment-gene interactions
[1,2,3,4], the identification of disease biomarkers [5,6,7,8,9] and
the discovery of drugs [10]. Unlike its older ‘‘omics’’ cousins,
where complete or near-complete coverage of the genome or
proteome is fairly routine, metabolomics still struggles to cover
even a tiny fraction of the metabolome. Indeed, most human
metabolomic studies published today, even those exploiting the
latest and most sensitive LC-MS/MS technologies, typically
succeed in identifying or characterizing fewer than 100 com￾pounds [11,12,13,14]. This corresponds to less than 1% of the
known human metabolome [15], [16]. In an effort to help improve
this situation, we (and others) have started to undertake the
systematic characterization of various human biofluid metabo￾lomes. This includes the human cerebrospinal fluid metabolome
[17], [18], the human saliva metabolome [19], and the human
serum metabolome [20]. We have now turned our attention to
characterizing the human urine metabolome.
Urine, as produced by mammals, is a transparent, sterile,
amber-colored fluid generated by the kidneys. The kidneys extract
the soluble wastes from the bloodstream, as well as excess water,
sugars, and a variety of other compounds. The resulting urine
contains high concentrations of urea (from amino acid metabo￾lism), inorganic salts (chloride, sodium, and potassium), creatinine,
ammonia, organic acids, various water-soluble toxins and
pigmented products of hemoglobin breakdown, including urobilin,
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 September 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 9 | e73076

which gives urine its characteristic color. Urination is the primary
route by which the body eliminates water-soluble waste products.
The average adult generates between 1.5–2.0 liters of urine per
day, which over the course of their lifetime would be enough to fill
a small backyard swimming pool (5 X 8 X 1.5 m).
While largely viewed as a waste product, urine has considerable
value as a diagnostic biofluid. Indeed the analysis of urine for
medical purposes dates back to ancient Egypt [21,22,23,24].
Hippocrates largely legitimized the medical practice of uroscopy
(the study of urine for medical diagnostics) where examination of
the color, cloudiness, smell and even the taste of urine was used to
identify a variety of diseases. Throughout the Byzantine era and
well into the Middle Ages, urine color wheels (a diagram that
linked the color of urine to a particular disease) were commonly
used by physicians to make diagnoses [21], [25]. A brownish color
would indicate jaundice, a red hue (blood) might indicate urinary
tract tumors, absence of color would be indicative of diabetes and
foamy urine would indicate proteinuria. With the advent of
modern clinical techniques in the middle of the 19th century,
uroscopy largely disappeared. However, urine has continued to be
an important cornerstone to modern medical practice. In fact, it
was the first biofluid to be used to clinically diagnose a human
genetic disease - alkaptonuria [26]. Even today urine analysis is
routinely performed with dipstick tests that can readily measure
urinary glucose, bilirubin, ketone bodies, nitrates, leukocyte
esterase, specific gravity, hemoglobin, urobilinogen and protein.
More detailed urinalysis can be also used to study a variety of renal
conditions, such as bladder, ovarian and kidney diseases
[27,28,29,30].
Being an important and easily accessible biological fluid, urine
has been the subject of detailed chemical analysis for more than
100 years [31], [32]. Extensive tables of normal reference ranges
have been published for more than 100 urine ions and metabolites
[33,34,35,36,37]. In addition to these referential clinical chemistry
studies, several groups have applied various ‘‘global’’ metabolomic
or metabolite profiling methods to urine, such as high resolution
nuclear magnetic resolution (NMR) spectroscopy [38,39,40], high
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) [41], high perfor￾mance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC￾MS/MS) [42], ultra high performance liquid chromatography￾high resolution orbitrap mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS)
[43], ultra high performance liquid chromatography (UPLC-RP)
[31], [44], fast atom bombardment ionization coupled with mass
spectroscopy (FAB-MS) [35], two-dimensional gas chromatogra￾phy coupled to quadrupole mass spectrometry (GCxGC-MS) [32]
or time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GCxGC-TOF-MS) [37],
nanoflow liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem
mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) [33] and liquid chromatog￾raphy coupled with electrospray quadruple time-of-flight mass
spectrometry (LC/QTOF-MS) [36]. A combination of two or
more profiling methods has also been used by many research
groups to help improve metabolite coverage [34], [40].
A comprehensive list of methods used to analyze urine and the
numbers of metabolites identified and/or quantified by these
methods (along with references) is provided in Table 1. As seen
from this table, it is possible to (tentatively) identify up to 294
different metabolites in human urine. However, quantification is
somewhat more difficult, with the largest number of quantified
metabolites ever reported in human urine being slightly less than
100. In addition to these global metabolomic studies, hundreds of
other ‘‘targeted’’ or single-metabolite studies have been conducted
on human urine that have led to the identification and
quantification of hundreds of other urine metabolites. Unfortu￾nately, this information is not located in any central repository.
Instead it is highly dispersed across numerous textbooks and
periodicals [16].
To facilitate future research into urine chemistry and urine
metabolomics, we believe it is critical to establish a comprehensive,
electronically accessible database of the detectable metabolites in
human urine. This document describes just such a database, one
that contains the metabolites that can, with today’s technology, be
detected in human urine along with their respective concentrations
and disease associations. This resource was assembled using a
combination of both our own experimental and literature-based
research. Experimentally, we used high-resolution NMR spectros￾copy, gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS), direct
flow injection tandem mass spectrometry (DFI/LC-MS/MS),
inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and high
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with ultraviolet (UV)
or fluorescence detection (FD) techniques performed on multiple
human urine samples to identify 445 metabolites or metabolite
species and quantify 378 of these compounds. To complement
these ‘‘global’’ metabolic profiling efforts, our team also surveyed
and extracted metabolite and disease-association data from more
than 3000 books and journal articles that had been identified
through computer-aided literature and in-house developed text￾mining software. This ‘‘bibliomic’’ effort yielded data for another
2206 metabolites. The resulting Urine Metabolome Database
(UMDB - http://www.urinemetabolome.ca) is a comprehensive,
web-accessible resource containing a total of 2651 confirmed urine

Results and Discussion
The Content of the Human Urine Metabolome – The
Urine Metabolome Database
The Urine Metabolome Database (UMDB: http://www.
urinemetabolome.ca) contains a complete list of all (to the best
of our knowledge) possible metabolites that have been detected in
human urine using current technologies. The UMDB is freely
available, easily queried, web-enabled database which provides a
list of the metabolite names, level of verification (confirmed or
probable), normal and disease-associated concentration ranges,
associated diseases and corresponding literature references for all
human urine metabolites that have ever been detected and/or
quantified in the literature. The UMDB also contains concentra￾tion data compiled from the experimental studies described here.
Each urine metabolite entry in this database is linked to a
MetaboCard button [15], [16] that, when clicked, brings up
detailed information about that particular entry. This detailed
information includes nomenclature, chemical, clinical and molec￾ular/biochemical data. Each MetaboCard entry contains up to
120 data fields many of which are hyperlinked to other databases
(KEGG [45], PubChem [46], MetaCyc [47], ChEBI [48], PDB
[49], UniProt [50], and GenBank [51] as well as to GeneCard IDs
[52], GeneAtlas IDs [53] and HGNC IDs [54] for each of the
corresponding enzymes or proteins known to act on that
metabolite). Additionally, the UMDB through its MetaboCard/
HMDB links includes nearly 450 hand-drawn, zoomable and fully
hyperlinked human metabolic pathway maps (SMPDB: http://
www.smpdb.ca/). These maps are intended to help users visualize
the chemical structures on metabolic pathways and to get detailed
information about metabolic processes [55]. These UMDB
pathway maps are quite specific to human metabolism and
explicitly show the subcellular compartments where specific
reactions are known to take place.
The UMDB’s simple text query (TextQuery) supports general
text queries including names, synonyms, conditions and disorders.
Clicking on the Browse button (on the UMDB navigation panel)
generates a tabular view that allows users to casually scroll through
the database or re-sort its contents by compound name or by
concentration. Users can choose either the ‘‘Metabolite View’’,
‘‘Concentration View’’ or ‘‘Diseases View’’ to facilitate their
browsing or searching. Clicking on a given MetaboCard button
brings up the full data content (from the HMDB) for the
corresponding metabolite. Users may also search the database
using a variety of options listed uner the ‘‘Search’’ menu. For
instance, the ChemQuery button allows users to draw or write
(using a SMILES string) a chemical compound to search the
UMDB for chemicals similar or identical to the query compound.
ChemQuery also supports chemical formula and molecular weight
searches. The Sequence Search button allows users to conduct
BLAST sequence searches of the 4075 protein sequences
contained in the UMDB. Both single and multiple sequence
BLAST queries are supported. ‘‘Advanced Search’’ which is also
located under the ‘‘Search’’ menu is the most sophisticated search
tool in the UMDB and opens an easy-to-use query search tool that
allows users to select or search over various combinations of
subfields. The UMDB’s ‘‘MS Search’’ allows users to submit mass
spectral peak lists that will be searched against the Human
Metabolome Database (HMDB)’s library of MS/MS spectra. This
potentially allows facile identification of urine metabolites from
mixtures via MS/MS spectroscopy. UMDB’s NMR Search allows
users to submit peak lists from 1
H or 13C NMR spectra (both pure
and mixtures) and have these peak lists compared to the NMR
libraries contained in the HMDB. This allows the identification of
metabolites from mixtures via NMR spectral data. The Download
button provides links to collected sequence, image and text files
associated with the UMDB. In the About menu, the ‘‘Data Fields
Explained’’ button lists source data used to assemble the UMDB.
Currently the UMDB contains information on 2651 detectable
metabolites or metabolite species (which corresponds to 3079
metabolites with precisely defined structures) and 3832 concen￾tration ranges or values associated with 220 different conditions,
diseases and disorders. The number of metabolites in the UMDB
is not a number that will remain unchanged. Rather it reflects the
total number of metabolites – most of which are endogenous - that
have ever been detected and/or quantified by ourselves and
others. Certainly as technology improves, we anticipate this
number will increase as other, lower abundance, metabolites are
detected and added to future versions of the UMDB. Likewise, if
the list was expanded to include intermittent, exogenous
compounds such as all possible drugs or drug metabolites or rare
food additives and food-derived phytochemicals, the database
could be substantially larger.
Inspection of the on-line tables in UMDB generally shows that
human urine contains a substantial number of hydrophilic
molecules. This is further reiterated in Table 2, which provides
a listing of the chemical ‘‘superclasses’’ (using the HMDB
definitions) in human urine and the number of representative
compounds that can be found in this biofluid. Excluding lipids
(which are in very low concentration), human urine is dominated
by amino acids and derivatives, carbohydrates and carbohydrate
conjugates. This simply reinforces the fact that urine is a key
carrier of hydrophilic waste products. Other small molecule
components found in high abundance in urine include hydroxy
acids and derivatives (such as citric acid), urea, ammonia,
creatinine and hippuric acid. A more detailed description of both
our literature and experimental findings is given in the following 7
sections covering: 1) Literature Review/Text Mining; 2) NMR; 3)
DFI/LC-MS/MS; 4) GC-MS; 5) ICP-MS; 6) HPLC/UV and 7)
HPLC/FD.
Metabolite Concentration in Urine – Literature Survey
In addition to the experimentally derived values obtained for
this study, the urine metabolome database (UMDB) also presents
literature-derived concentrations of urine metabolites with refer￾ences to either PubMed IDs or clinical textbooks. In many cases,
multiple concentration values are given for ‘‘normal’’ conditions.
This is done to provide users/readers with a better estimate of the
potential concentration variations that different technologies or
laboratories may measure. As a general rule, there is good
agreement between most laboratories and methods. However, the
literature results presented in the UMDB do not reflect the true
state of the raw literature. A number of literature-derived
concentration values were eliminated through the curation process
after being deemed mistaken, disproven (by subsequent published
studies), mis-typed or physiologically impossible. Much of the
curation process involved having multiple curators carefully
reading and re-reading the primary literature to check for unit
type, unit conversion and typographical inconsistencies.

abundant organic metabolites found in urine (based on average
values) are urea (22.5 6 4.4 mM/mM creatinine), creatinine (10.4
6 2.0 mM), hippuric acid (298.5 6 276.8 mM/mM creatinine)
and citric acid (280.6 6 115.2 mM/mM creatinine). The least
abundant (detectable) metabolites in urine include oxytocin (0.9 6
0.1 pM/mM creatinine), angiotensin II (1.2 6 0.2 pM/mM
creatinine), 15-deoxy-d-12,14-PGJ2 (2.3 6 1.0 pM/mM creati￾nine) and melatonin (3.3 6 2.7 pM/mM creatinine). This shows
that the current lower limit of detection for metabolites in urine is
in the low pM/mM creatinine range and that the concentration
range of analytes in urine spans nearly 11 orders of magnitude.
One point that is particularly interesting is the fact that the
concentration (scaled to creatinine) of the average metabolite in
normal urine varies by about 6 50%, with some metabolites
varying by as much as 6 350% (such as normetanephrine
(0.00085 6 0.00317 mM/mM creatinine), pipecolic acid (0.03 6
0.07 mM/mM creatinine), enterodiol (0.032 6 0.072 mM/mM
creatinine), tungsten (0.010 6 0.022 mM/mM creatinine) and
chlorogenic acid (0.0014 6 0.0029 mM/mM creatinine). There￾fore, drawing conclusions about potential disease biomarkers
without properly taking into account this variation would be ill￾advised. We believe that these relatively large metabolite
concentration ranges are due to a number of factors, including
age, gender, genetic background, diurnal variation, health status,
activity level and diet [56,57,58,59]. Indeed, some UMDB entries
explicitly show such variations based on the populations (age,
gender) from which these metabolite concentrations were derived.
Clearly more study on the contributions to the observed variations
in urine is warranted, although with thousands of metabolites to
measure for dozens of conditions, these studies will obviously
require significant technical and human resources.
Experimental Quantification and Identification of Urine
Metabolites – NMR
A representative high-resolution NMR spectrum of urine from a
healthy individual is shown in Figure 1. As can be readily seen
from this figure, urine NMR spectra are very information-rich and
surprisingly complex, with thousands of resolved peaks. From the
22 healthy control urine samples analyzed, we could identify a
total of 209 unique compounds with an average of 167 6 19
compounds being identified per sample. Every compound was
unequivocally identified and quantified using spectral fitting (via
Chenomx) and/or spike-in experiments with authentic standards.
The concentration of each metabolite was normalized to each
urine sample’s corresponding creatinine value to compensate for
variations in urine volume (the concentration of metabolites is
expressed as mM/mM creatinine).
The 209 compounds identified and quantified from these NMR
studies represent a ‘‘high-water’’ mark for NMR-based metabo￾lomics. Previous studies have reported up to 70 compounds being
identified and/or quantified in human urine [40]. Indeed,
compared to other platforms previously used to analyze human
urine (Table 1), it appears that NMR may currently be the most
comprehensive and certainly the most quantitative approach to
characterizing this biofluid. Based on the fitted area under each
urinary NMR spectrum and the number of unidentified peaks we
estimate that more than 96% of the spectral area and more than
92% of all NMR-detectable compounds in our human urine
samples are listed in Table 3. In other words, for NMR-based
metabolomics, human urine is essentially ‘‘solved’’. The same
‘‘solved’’ status has already been achieved for human serum (with
49 definitive compounds, [20]) and for human cerebrospinal fluid
(with 53 definitive compounds, [17]). Knowing the expected or
detectable composition of these biofluids should open the door to
automated NMR-based metabolomics [60].
Based on these NMR studies, the most abundant constituents
(based on average values) of urine from a healthy individual are
urea (12.3 6 14.5 mM/mM creatinine), creatinine (14.7 6
9.8 mM), hippuric acid (229 6 160 mM/mM creatinine) and
citric acid (203 6 129 mM/mM creatinine). The least abundant
compounds were trans-ferulic acid (1.2 mM/mM creatinine),
phosphorylcholine (1.1 6 0.7 mM/mM creatinine), 4-ethylphenol
(0.9 6 0.1 mM/mM creatinine), 2-methylglutaric acid (0.8 6
0.4 mM/mM creatinine). The lowest concentrations that could be
reliably detected using NMR were 0.4 6 0.1 mM/mM creatinine
(for maleic acid), 0.5 6 0.2 mM/mM creatinine (for alpha￾ketoisovaleric acid and N-acetylputrescine) and 0.7 6 0.4 mM/
mM creatinine (for fumaric acid). The complete list of average
compound concentrations (including their range), literature￾reported concentrations (for healthy adult) and the frequency of
their occurrence is shown in Table 3. In general, there is good
agreement between the NMR-measured concentrations and those
reported in the literature (often obtained by other analytical
techniques).
However, not all of the NMR-derived urine concentrations
agree with literature-derived values. A total of 34 compounds had
average concentrations somewhat higher (.1 SD) than previously
reported values (for example, 1, 3-dimethyluric acid, glucaric acid,
L-aspartic acid, mannitol), while 21 compounds had average
concentrations lower (,1 SD) than previously reported (for

Another 7 metabolites also exhibited somewhat greater range in
concentrations than those previously reported in the literature.
These included: acetic acid, butyric acid, isovaleric acid, lactose,
phenylglyoxylic acid, proline-betaine and trans-ferulic acid. Some
of these discrepancies are likely due to differences in diet,
physiological status, pharmacological effects and the age of the

to storage effects, sample preparation methods and the analytical
methods being used. As a rule, NMR concentration determina￾tions are very accurate since they involve direct measurement of
the compound, as opposed to an indirect measurement of a
derivative compound. Therefore we are quite confident in the
NMR concentration values reported in Table 3 and would tend to
view these as more reliable than those measured via other
technologies.
A number of the compounds exhibiting higher-than or lower￾than-reported concentrations appear to be associated with dietary
intake. For example, mannitol is a sugar alcohol that is poorly
absorbed by humans but its presence in urine can be explained by
its occurrence in commonly consumed foods such as apples,
pineapples, asparagus and carrots. Likewise, the urinary excretion
of trans-ferulic acid (a polyphenolic derivative) increases after the
ingestion of breakfast cereals [61] and chocolate. The relatively
low value we measured is likely due to the fact that the literature
value of trans-ferulic acid reported in Table 3 was measured for
people on a special diet [62]. Also, the low level of proline-betaine
we measured in urine may be due to a lower frequency of exposure
to dietary citrus fruits in our population sample [63]. Proline￾betaine is an osmoprotectant found in citrus fruit and urinary
excretion of this metabolite is increased after consumption of fruits
such as orange juice [64]. Similarly the higher levels of dimethyl
sulfone we detected in urine could be attributed to dietary sources
that contain DMSO [65]. For example, onions contain many
sulfoxides including DMSO which can be oxidized in the liver and
kidneys to produce dimethyl sulfone [66], [67]. The consumption
of meat could also significantly increase the concentration of some
metabolites in urine as reported in the case of 1-methylhistidine
[68]. 1-methylhistidine is produced from the metabolism of
anserine (a dipeptide) which is commonly found in meats [69],
[70]. In addition to diet, metabolite levels in urine can also be
affected by physiological status. For instance, the level of 3-
hydroxybutyric acid in urine increases during fasting and can
range from 0 to 200 mM/mM creatinine, with the maximum level
reported in the literature (200 mM/mM creatinine) corresponding
to healthy male after 35 h of fasting [50].
Some of the metabolites we measured by NMR did not have
any previously reported literature values. For example, glucuronic
acid is usually reported as total glucuronic acid (the free acid plus
glucuronide conjugates) after hydrolysis [71], [72]. Here we report
the concentration of free glucuronic acid, as indicated in Table 3.
Another example, 2-methylerythritol, was previously detected in
human urine but no concentration was reported [73]. The urinary
excretion of 2-methylerythritol is most likely a result of dietary
consumption of fruits or vegetables containing 2-methylerythritol
and/or 2-methylerythritol-4-phosphate. 2-methylerythritol-4-
phosphate is an intermediate in isoprenoid biosynthesis [74] and
has been found to be quite abundant in certain plants [75].
A number of compounds we measured by NMR appear to be
normal constituents of human urine but seem not to have been
previously reported as being detectable by NMR (a total of 42
compounds) or reported as detected but not-quantified by any
other method (a total of 8 compounds). The identification of these
‘‘NMR-novel’’ compounds was aided by their prior identification
by GC-MS and DI-MS (see following sections) and through a
careful literature analysis of compounds that had previously been
detected in human urine via other methods. The list of detected
but not previously quantified by NMR compounds includes: 2-
hydroxy-3-methylpentanoic acid, 2-methyl-3-ketovaleric acid, 2-
methylerythritol, glucuronic acid, monomethyl glutaric acid, N￾methylhydantoin, phosphorylcholine and scyllitol. All of these
compounds were confirmed using authentic standards.
This NMR study also revealed a number of common
identification errors made in previously published NMR-based
human urine metabolomic studies. In particular, several earlier
reports identified phenylacetylglycine [76], N-acetylglutamic acid

[77], cresol [78], isonicotinic acid [78], yellow 7.1 [79], meta￾hydroxyphenylpropionic acid [80], 2-oxoisocaproic acid [81],
urocanic acid, glycylproline and ornithine [80] as being detectable
by NMR in human urine. Using our NMR instrument and the
samples available to us, we were unable to detect any of these
compounds, even after performing multiple spike-in experiments
using authentic compounds. While some of these metabolites have
been previously reported to be in human urine, they were reported
at concentrations far below the lower limit of detection of modern
NMR instruments (which is , 1 mM). Due to their chemical shift
similarity, phenylacetylglycine (which is found only in rats and
mice) and N-acetylglutamic acid appear to be commonly mistaken
for phenylacetylglutamine. We also noticed that, isonicotinic acid
(a breakdown product of isoniazid and hydrazine derivatives,
which is found only in individuals that have taken isoniazid and
other hydrazine derivatives as a drug) appears to be mistaken for
trigonelline. Likewise cresol (water-insoluble) appears to be
frequently mistaken for cresol-sulfate (water-soluble), while the
compounds yellow 7.1, meta-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid and 3-
(p-hydroxyphenyl)-propionic acid appear to be commonly mistak￾en for 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-3-hydroxypropanoic acid (HPHPA).
In addition to correcting these compound identification errors,
we also observed some significant gender-related effects on
creatinine levels in our urine samples. Since males generally have
a greater mass of skeletal muscle than females, they tend to have
higher urinary levels of creatinine than women. This was clearly
evident in our samples as the average male creatinine level was
20 mM while the average female creatinine level was 11 mM. In
addition, increased dietary intake of creatine or a protein-rich diet
can increase daily creatinine excretion [82].
Quantification and Identification of Urine Metabolites –
GC-MS
As seen in Table 1, GC-MS methods have long been used to
comprehensively characterize the chemical content of human
urine. For our studies a total of 4 different GC-MS analyses were
performed. The first method employed polar solvent extraction
and derivatization to achieve broad metabolite coverage of polar
metabolites, the second was more selective and targeted organic
acids, the third targeted volatiles, while the fourth targeted bile
acids. Representative high-resolution GC-MS total ion chromato￾grams are shown in Figures 2–4 for each of these analyses (except
for the bile acids). Combined, the 4 GC-MS methods allowed us
to identify 179 and quantify a total of 85 compounds. Table 4
shows the identified polar, organic acid extracts and bile acids (127
in total), Table 5 shows the identified volatile metabolites (52 in
total) while Table 6 shows the 85 fully quantified compounds from
all 4 techniques. These numbers actually represent the highest
number of urine metabolites both identified and quantified by
GC-MS to date. As seen in Table 1, previous GC-MS studies have
reported up to 258 unique compounds being identified (but none
quantified) [83] and approximately 95 compounds quantified in
human urine [84]. Relative to NMR (see previous section) and
other methods used to analyze human urine (Table 1), it appears
that a multi-pronged GC-MS analysis is an excellent approach to
characterize this biofluid. However, unlike NMR where nearly all
detectable peaks are identifiable, metabolite coverage by GC-MS
tends to be relatively incomplete. As seen in Figure 2, only 60% of
the peaks could be identified using as reference the 2008 NIST
library and other home-made GC-MS metabolite libraries.
Likewise, in Figure 3, we see that only 65% of the organic acid
peaks could be identified while in Figure 4, just 60% of the volatile
compound peaks could be identified.
Incomplete compound identification is a common problem with
global or untargeted GC-MS metabolomics. This may be due to
any number of factors including spectral overlap due to
incomplete separation, poor signal to noise for low intensity peaks,
the lack of reference GC-MS spectral data for certain metabolites
(especially unusual dietary sources), or the presence of spectral
artefacts such as derivatization by-products or degraded metab￾olites in the GC-MS spectrum. For our GC-MS studies we used
the NIST library supplemented with a home-made GC-MS
reference library of known urine compounds assembled from the
Human Metabolome Library [16]. No doubt the use of other
commercially available reference GC-MS libraries such as the
Fiehn GC-MS library from Agilent or the GOLM metabolome
database library [85] might have allowed us to further increase our
coverage. Likewise the use of a faster scan rate and/or a more
sensitive GC-TOF instrument (instead of a slower scanning

quadrupole GC-MS) certainly would have increased overall
coverage.
Nearly all of the non-volatile metabolites (87) identified by our
GC-MS analyses were also identified by NMR. Some of the
exceptions were oxalic acid, phosphate and uric acid, each of
which was detected by GC-MS but not by NMR. These
compounds do not have NMR-detectable protons at physiological
pH, making them essentially ‘‘NMR invisible’’. Other compounds
seen by GC-MS but not by NMR included metabolites that were
generally below the detection limit of NMR (,2 mM/mM
creatinine) such as indolelactic acid and 2,4-dihydroxybutanoic
acid. For our non-targeted GC-MS analysis, the lower limit of
detection was 1 mM/mM creatinine (for 2,4-dihydroxybutanoic
acid), while for our targeted organic acid GC-MS analysis the
lower limit of detection was 0.7 mM/mM creatinine (for m￾chlorobenzoic acid). Overall, our data suggests that the sensitivity
of a standard single quadrupole GC-MS instrument is perhaps
1.5–2X better than a 500 MHz NMR instrument for water￾soluble metabolites. It is also important to note that the level of
water-soluble, non-volatile metabolite coverage obtained by GC￾MS is not as great as seen with NMR (127 cmpds vs. 209 cmpds).
The limited coverage of GC-MS is partly due to the fact that not
all compounds can be readily extracted, easily derivatized or
routinely separated on a GC column. Furthermore, when
analyzing urine by GC-MS there is a need to pretreat the sample
with urease (to reduce urea levels) that can diminish the
abundance of some metabolites [86]. While GC-MS may not be
the best method for analyzing water-soluble metabolites, it
certainly excels at the detection of volatile metabolites. Indeed,
only one of the volatile metabolites identified by GC-MS is
identified by NMR (phenol). This certainly underlines a key
strength of GC-MS relative to other metabolomics platforms.
When comparing NMR to GC-MS we found that NMR is
capable of detecting 121 compounds that the 4 combined GC-MS
methods cannot detect while the combined GC-MS methods can
detect 91 compounds that NMR cannot routinely detect. Overall,
these data suggest that GC-MS and NMR appear to be
complementary methods for the identification and quantification
of small molecules in urine.
Among the 58 metabolites quantified by both GC-MS and
NMR we found very good overall agreement, with the majority of
measured concentration values falling within 20 6 11% of each
other. The concentration patterns and rankings of the most
abundant to the least abundant compounds were also largely
identical for the two platforms. A total of 12 metabolites exhibited
somewhat larger concentration discrepancies between GC-MS
and NMR (i.e; L-arabinose, L-serine (lower in GC-MS vs. NMR),
4-hydroxybenzoic acid and tyrosine (higher in GC-MS vs NMR).
Some of these concentration differences may be due to the
extraction or derivatization process needed to conduct GC-MS
analyses. This can lead to unspecified compound losses, unusual
derivatives or unrecognized fragmentation patterns. Therefore we
would have expected at least a few GC-MS concentration values
to be slightly lower than those seen by NMR. Likewise, it is
important to remember that there are inherent errors (5–10%) in
measuring peak areas (i.e. compound concentrations) both in GC￾Figure 3. Typical GC-MS total ion chromatogram of organic acids extracted from human urine. Numbers indicate the following

MS and NMR due to peak overlap, uneven baselines and spectral
noise.
Nearly all of the compounds we detected or quantified in
human urine by GC-MS have been previously described or
mentioned in the GC-MS literature. One compound (scyllitol),
however, appears not to have been previously detected by GC￾MS. The identification of this compound by our GC-MS method
was aided by its prior identification by NMR (see previous section).
Additionally, a careful literature analysis also indicated the scyllitol
is a normal constituent of human urine and has previously been
detected in human urine via other methods.
As we noted with our NMR studies earlier, there are a few
previously reported GC-MS detectable metabolites in human
urine that appear to be artefacts. These artefactual metabolites
may arise from extractions with different solvents, pre-treatment
with urease, and chemical derivatization. For example, Shoemaker
et al [84], reported the presence of bisethane in human urine. We
also detected bisethane, but it appears to be artefact of chemical
derivatization and is not a urine metabolite.
Quantification and Identification of Urine Metabolites –
Combined Direct Flow Injection and LC-MS/MS Assay
Direct flow injection (DFI) MS/MS or DFI-MS/MS is
another commonly used global metabolic profiling method
[87]. When isotopic standards are used along with multiple
reactions monitoring (MRM), it is also possible to perform
targeted metabolomics with very accurate concentration mea￾surements. For our urine studies, we employed a combined
DFI/LC-MS/MS approach, based on the commercially avail￾able AbsoluteIDQ p180 Kit (BIOCRATES Life Sciences AG,
Innsbruck). When applied to urine, we were able to identify and
quantify a total of 127 metabolites or metabolite species,
including 34 acylcarnitines, 21 amino acids, 15 biogenic amines,
creatinine, hexose, 35 phospatidylcholines, 15 sphingomyelins

and 5 lysophosphatidylcholines. The amino acids and biogenic
amines are analyzed by an LC-MS/MS method, whereas all
other metabolites are analyzed by DFI-MS/MS as indicated in
Table 7. DFI-MS/MS identifies lipid species (as opposed to
specific lipids) using their total acyl/alkyl chain content (i.e. PC
(38:4)) rather than their unique structure. Therefore each lipid
species identified by the BIOCRATES kit typically corresponds
to 5–10 possible unique lipid structures. Consequently, the total
number of phosphatidylcholines, sphingolipids and lysophospha￾tidylcholines structures identified by this method was 458, 19
and 6, respectively. Therefore, combining these probable lipid
structures (483 in total, based on the known fatty acid and lipid
composition in human serum) with the other 72 confirmed non￾lipid metabolites, the DFI-MS/MS method yields 555 con￾firmed and probable metabolites or metabolite structures. All of
these compounds, along with their corresponding estimated
concentrations have all been entered into the UMDB.
Our results show very good agreement with the previous studies
conducted by BIOCRATES on human urine samples (Biocrates
Application Note 1005-1). We found that the lower limit of
quantification by DFI MS/MS based on the AbsoluteIDQ kit was
0.1 nM/mM creatinine for certain phosphatidylcholine species
(i.e. PC aa C40:3) and 0.1 nM/mM creatinine for certain
sphingomyelin species (i.e. SM 26:1). Comparison of our lipid
results with literature data was difficult as relatively few papers
report urine lipid concentration data. Indeed, the presence of
lipids in urine is a little unexpected, but not entirely unreasonable.
It is likely that urea, a well known chaotrope, facilitates the
dissolution of small amounts of fatty acids and other lipid species in
urine.
Many of the compounds we measured with this kit assay appear
to be normal constituents of human urine but have not been
previously reported (quantified and/or detected) in the scientific
literature (with the exception of the BIOCRATES Application
Note). In total, 53 compounds are being reported here for the first
time as being normal constituents of human urine, while 68
compounds are being robustly quantified in human urine for the
first time. The vast majority of these compounds are lipids.
Based on our results, the combined DFI/LC-MS/MS method
detected 98 compounds or compound species that GC-MS and
NMR methods could not detect, while GC-MS detected 161
compounds and NMR detected 181 compounds that DFI/LC￾MS/MS could not detect. The 3 methods were able to detect a
common set of 17 compounds including creatinine, L-glutamine,
L-tryptophan, L-tyrosine and L-valine. Interestingly, the con￾centrations measured by DFI/LC-MS/MS, NMR and GC-MS
(across the shared set of 17 compounds) showed generally good
agreement (within 19 6 7% of each other). The relatively small
overlap, in terms of compound coverage, between the 3
platforms is a bit of a surprise and certainly serves to emphasize
the tremendous chemical diversity that must exist in urine.
Overall, by combining these 3 platforms, we were able to
identify 295 and quantify 231 unique or non-overlapping
metabolites or metabolite species. These data suggest that
DFI/LC-MS/MS, GC-MS and NMR are highly complemen￾tary techniques for the identification and quantification of
metabolites in human urine.
Quantification and Identification of Urinary Trace Metals
– ICP-MS
To determine the trace elemental composition of urine, we used
inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). ICP-MS
is widely considered to be one of the best techniques for the
characterization of the trace element composition of biological
samples [88], [89]. Indeed, none of the other methods (1
H-NMR,
GC-MS and DFI/LC-MS/MS) are suited for measuring trace
element composition or concentrations. Our multi-elemental
analysis of urine using ICP-MS provided quantitative results for
a total of 40 metals or trace minerals (Table 8). Based on their
frequency of occurrence and overall abundance, all 40 trace

The Human Urine Metabolome

elements appear to be normal constituents of human urine. Of
these, 2 have previously not been quantified for healthy adults.
As far as we are aware, this is the first multi-elemental study of
urine that has been performed by ICP-MS. As seen in Table 8,
there is generally good agreement between the values measured by
ICP-MS and those previously reported in literature, with
differences generally being less than 22 6 10%. Larger differences
are seen for gallium (Ga), lead (Pb), Neodymium (Nd), titanium
(Ti) and vanadium (V), but these may be due to the effects of age,
diet, local environment (minerals in local water) or diurnal
variation. Alternately they may reflect real differences in the
sensitivity or accuracy of the instruments being used. As a general
rule, ICP-MS is considered as a gold standard for the identification
and quantification of trace metals [18], so we would tend to place
higher confidence in the values derived via ICP-MS over those
measured by other technologies. By our measurements, the most
abundant metals/salts are sodium (Na) (12.5 6 10.6 mM/mM
creatinine) and potassium (K) (3.6 6 2.5 mM/mM creatinine) – as
expected, while the least abundant was rhenium (Re) with a lower
limit of quantification by ICP-MS of 96 pM/mM creatinine.
Quantification and Identification of Urine Metabolites –
Targeted HPLC Assays
The inventory of metabolites we detected and quantified by 1
H
NMR, GC-MS, DFI/LC-MS/MS and ICP-MS covers a signif￾icant portion of all chemical classes. However, these methods
sometimes lack the necessary sensitivity, the appropriate instru￾mental configuration or detection capabilities and therefore fail to
detect/quantify a variety of important compound classes. This
includes a number of molecules that are normal constituents of
urine such as thiols and isoflavones. To identify and quantify these
2 classes of metabolites we decided to employ High Performance
Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). HPLC assays are the method of
choice for detecting isoflavones and thiols as they are sensitive,
precise and can be easily coupled with sensitive detection
methodologies such as fluorescence and ultraviolet detection. In
our studies, fluorescence and ultraviolet detection were used for
the identification and quantification of urinary thiols and
isoflavones, respectively.
Biological thiols, or mercaptans, are very active metabolic
products of sulfur and play a central role in redox metabolism,
cellular homeostasis and a variety of physiological and patholog￾ical processes. In urine, the most important thiols are L-cysteine
and L-cysteinylglycine [90,91,92,93]. Isoflavones or phytoestro￾gens form or constitute another important class of urinary
metabolites [90]. Humans are exposed to these biologically active
phytochemicals mainly through food intake via vegetables, fruit
and wheat/bread products [94]. For the detection of thiols we
developed assays to measure L-cysteine, L-cysteineglycine, L￾glutathione and L-homocysyeine, while for isoflavones we
developed assays to measure biochanin A, coumesterol, daidzein,
equol, formonentin and genistein. Using these HPLC assays, we
measured a total of 4 thiols and 6 isoflavones in urine (Table 9).
As seen in Table 9, there is generally good agreement between
the values measured by these targeted HPLC assays and those
previously reported in literature, with differences generally being
less than ,30%. Only one of these metabolites (L-cysteine) was
measured independently on one of our other platforms (NMR)
and the NMR concentration was found to be 25% lower than the
HPLC assay. A possible explanation for this discrepancy is that
cysteine measured by HPLC-FD yields total L-cysteine including
the free form and L-cystine reduced to L-cysteine during the
reaction [95]. On the other hand, NMR can distinguish between
L-cysteine and L-cystine.
The Composition of Human Urine – Comparison with
Other Biofluids
By combining a systematic computer-aided literature survey
with an extensive, quantitative multiplatform metabolomic anal￾ysis we have been able to comprehensively characterize the human
urine metabolome. Our data suggests that there are at least 3079
detectable metabolites in human urine, of which 1350 have been
quantified. At least 72 of these compounds are of microbial origin,
1453 are endogenous while 2282 are considered exogenous (note
some compounds can be both exogenous and endogenous),
coming from diet, drugs, cosmetics or environmental exposure.
Using a chemical classification system developed for the HMDB
[15] we found that human urinary metabolites fall into 230
different chemical classes (25 ‘‘super classes’’, Table 2). Given that
there are only 356 chemical classes in the entire human
metabolome [16], this certainly demonstrates the enormous
chemical diversity found in urine. As might be expected, most
urinary metabolites are very hydrophilic, although there are
clearly trace amounts of lipids and fatty acids that contribute a
significant number of chemicals to the urinary metabolome (836
fatty acids and lipids). This is in rather striking contrast to the
composition of serum [20] which is particularly rich in lipids (i.e.
.17000 lipids and fatty acids). Relative to other biofluids such as
CSF [18] or saliva [19], urine contains significantly more
compounds (5–10X) and exhibits significantly more chemical
diversity (2–3X). On the other hand, we know that every
compound that is found in human urine is also found in human
blood. In other words, the human urine metabolome is a subset of
the human serum metabolome, both in terms of composition and
chemical diversity [20]. However, more than 484 compounds we
identified in urine (either experimentally or via literature review)
were not previously reported to be in blood. The fact that so many
compounds seem to be unique to urine likely has to do with the
fact that the kidneys do an extraordinary job of concentrating
certain metabolites from the blood. Consequently compounds that
are far below the limit of detection in blood (using today’s
instrumentation) are well above the detection limit in urine. In

fact, concentration differences between the two biofluids some￾times exceed 1000X for certain compounds, such as histamine,
androsterone, normetanephrine, testosterone 13, 14-dihydro-15-
keto-PGE2, m-tyramine and aldosterone. So, while the number of
water-soluble compounds in blood and urine may be almost
identical, the concentrations of these compounds are often
profoundly different. This difference, combined with the ability
of the kidney to handle abnormally high or abnormally low
concentrations of metabolites, makes urine a particularly useful
biofluid for medical diagnostics. In fact, according to our data in
the UMDB, urinary metabolites have been used to characterize
nearly 220 diseases. Furthermore, the ability of the kidneys to filter
toxins or xenobiotics makes urine a particularly useful biofluid for
diet and drug monitoring and for assessing chemical or pollutant
exposure [96].

One of the central motivations behind this work was to ascertain
the strengths and weaknesses of several common metabolomic
platforms for characterizing human urine. We employed 6
different analytical platforms: NMR; GC-MS; DFI/LC-MS/MS;

The Human Urine Metabolome

derived knowledge about the composition of human urine, along
with custom-derived spectral libraries and targeted assays we were
able to ‘‘push the limits’’ in terms of number of compounds that
could be identified and/or quantified via each platform. In total,
we identified 445 and quantified 378 distinct metabolites using
these 6 different systems. According to Table 1, this is the largest
number of urine metabolites ever identified and/or quantified in a
single study. NMR spectroscopy was able to identify and quantify
209 compounds; GC-MS was able to identify 179 and quantify 85
compounds; DFI/LC-MS/MS identified and quantified 127
compounds; ICP-MS identified and quantified 40 compounds;
while customized HPLC assays (with UV or FD detection)
identified and quantified 10 compounds. The number of urinary
metabolites we identified/quantified for NMR, GC-MS, DFI/LC￾MS/MS and ICP-MS all represent ‘‘records’’ for these platforms.
In terms of platform overlap and compound complementarity,
NMR and GC-MS were able to identify a common set of 88
metabolites; NMR and DFI/LC-MS/MS were able to identify
and quantify a common set of 28 metabolites, while NMR, GC￾MS and DFI/LC-MS/MS were able to identify a common set of
17 metabolites (15 amino acids, creatinine and hexose/glucose).
All of these results are summarized in a Venn diagram (Figure 5).
As might be expected, metabolite coverage differs from one
analytical technique to another. These are difference mostly due to
the intrinsic nature of the devices or platforms used. In particular,
significant differences exist between these platforms in terms of
their sensitivity or separation and/or extraction efficiency.
Likewise the use of targeted vs. non-targeted methods along with
issues related to compound stability, solubility and volatility led to
some significantly different platform-dependent results.
Given that the known, quantifiable urine metabolome consists
of ,2651 known metabolites and metabolite species (correspond￾ing to 3079 distinct structures), we can calculate that NMR is able
to measure ,8% (209/2651) of the human urine metabolome;
GC-MS is able to measure ,7% (179/2651); DFI/LC-MS/MS is
able to measure ,5% (127/2651); ICP-MS/MS is able to
measure ,1.5% (40/2651); HPLC/UV is able to measure
,0.2% (6/2651); while HPLC/FD is able to measure ,0.15%
(4/2651) of the urine metabolome. When combined, the 6
analytical techniques are able to cover .16% of the known
urinary metabolome (.445/2651). If we re-evaluate this fraction
in terms of total metabolite structures (corresponding to known
and highly probable metabolites), the urine metabolome consists of
3079 compounds. From this total we can calculate that NMR is
able to measure ,7% (209/3079) of the human urine metabo￾lome; GC-MS is able to measure ,6% (179/3079); DFI/LC-MS/
MS is able to measure ,18% (555/3079); ICP-MS/MS is able to
measure ,1.3% (40/3079); HPLC/UV is able to measure ,0.2%
(6/3079); while HPLC/FD is able to measure ,0.13% (4/3079) of
the urine metabolome. When combined, the 6 analytical
techniques are able to cover .28% of the known and probable
or putative urinary metabolome (.873/3079). In terms of
chemical class coverage, NMR detects compounds from 15 of
the 25 major chemical superclasses in urine, GC-MS detects
compounds from 14 of the 25, DFI/LC-MS/MS detects 6 of the
25, ICP-MS detects 1 of the 25 while the targeted methods for
thiols and isoflavones detect just 1 of each.
From these data we can conclude that NMR is currently the
best method for identifying and quantifying urinary compounds.
Not only does it permit measurement of the largest number of
metabolites (209) but it also yields the greatest chemical diversity.
Furthermore, NMR is non-destructive so that the same sample can
be subsequently re-used for GC-MS, LC-MS or ICP-MS analyses.

collection for NMR also make it much more appealing for urine
metabolomics, although the spectral analysis can be quite slow
(,1–2 hours per sample). While GC-MS is a close second in terms
of overall coverage (179 metabolites, 14 chemical superclasses),
these numbers represents the result of 4 different analyses
performed on 2 different GC-MS instruments. Many labs would
not have these multiple configurations available or the resources to
routinely run these types of analyses. Likewise each sample
required many hours of preparation, sample collection and data
analysis. In this regard, multi-platform GC-MS is definitely not a
high-throughput metabolomics technique. Relative to NMR and
GC-MS, DFI/LC-MS/MS also performs well, with 127 com￾pounds being quantified. However, DFI/LC-MS/MS provides
very limited chemical diversity (only 6 chemical superclasses). On
the other hand, DFI/LC-MS/MS requires very little sample
volume (10 mL) and it is a very low-cost, largely automated, high￾Table 8. Concentrations of ions (mmol/mmol creatinine) as determined by ICP-MS.

throughput route for measuring metabolites. The other techniques
(HPLC, ICP-MS) we employed in this study, while useful, do not
come close to matching the coverage or diversity of NMR, GC￾MS or DFI/LC-MS/MS.
While we certainly went to considerable lengths to use current
or cutting edge technologies to characterize the urine metabolome,
it is also important to note that there is always potential for future
improvement. Using higher field (900–950 MHz) NMR instru￾ments, employing newer model GC-MS instruments or more
sensitive GC-TOF instruments, using more than 3 derivatization
or extraction steps for our GC-MS analyses, employing the latest
version of the NIST database or a larger collection of GC-MS
databases, implementing more sophisticated or targeted detection
and separation techniques, using various commercial immunode￾tection kits or employing the latest LC-MS/MS techniques
coupled to FT-MS or orbitraps – all of these could have added
to the quantity and diversity of metabolites detected or quantified.
However, like many laboratories, our resources are somewhat

The Human Urine Metabolome

limited. Furthermore, in this study we wanted to address the
question of how well a cross-section of commonly accessible
metabolomic methods or platforms could perform in identifying
and quantifying metabolites in urine.
While being able to quantitatively compare metabolite coverage
and chemical diversity amongst the major metabolomics platforms
(NMR, GC-MS and DFI/LC-MS/MS) is important, it is also
useful to compare their consistency or reproducibility in terms of
metabolite quantification. In particular we decided to assess the 3
major platforms in terms of their ability to identify and quantify a
common group of compounds, namely the amino acids. Overall
we found that the measured concentrations are in relatively good
agreement (Table 10). However, a few exceptions are evident. For
example, the NMR and DFI/LC-MS/MS concentrations of
glycine and serine are higher than the GC-MS values (note that
glycine exhibits the highest concentration among urinary amino
acids). For serine, after the silylation reaction using MSTFA, we
obtained serine-2TMS (13.9 min) and serine-3TMS derivatives
(16.6 min). The chromatographic peak corresponding to serine￾2TMS is weak and overlaps slightly with the urea peak. This
overlap and the corresponding difficulty in peak integration may
explain the quantitation differences compared to other analytical
assays. Neither L-glutamine nor L-glutamic acid could be
accurately quantified or identified by GC-MS. In our case, the
glutamine peak co-elutes with glycerol-3-phosphate. Other inves￾tigators have noted that glutamine can also be hydrolyzed and
converted to glutamic acid [97], or to pyroglutamic acid during
derivatization [95]. As a result, only pyroglutamic acid could be
identified in our GC-MS assay. The identification of glutamic acid
and pyroglutamic acid can be complicated [97], which explains
our failure to identify glutamic acid by GC-MS. L-arginine could
not be detected by GC-MS, because it is converted to ornithine
during derivatization [98], which probably explains the slightly
higher concentration of ornithine measured by GC-MS, compared
to the one determined by DFI/LC-MS/MS. Finally, L-cysteine
and L-cystine can only be identified and quantified by NMR and
targeted HPLC/FD because the identification and quantification
of theses metabolites is not possible with the Biocrates kit. With
GC-MS it has often been noted that L-cystine can be converted to
L-cysteine during derivatization, while L-cysteine might be
oxidized to L-cystine during prolonged storage of the standard
solution [95], confounding the identification of L-cystine and L￾cysteine.
Conclusion
Using a combination of multiple experimental assays supple￾mented with an extensive computer–assisted literature survey we
were able to identify a total of 2651 metabolites or metabolite
species (corresponding to 3079 distinct structures) that can be or
have been identified and/or quantified in human urine using
today’s technology. This information, which includes both normal
and abnormal (disease or exposure-associated) metabolites has
been placed into a publicly accessible web-enabled database called
the Urine Metabolome Database (UMDB). To assess the validity
of the literature data and to further investigate the capabilities of
existing metabolomics technologies we conducted a comprehen￾sive, quantitative analysis of human urine from 22 healthy
volunteers. A total of 6 different platforms: NMR, GC-MS,
DFI/LC-MS/MS, ICP-MS, HPLC/UV and HPLC/FD were
used in this analysis. From this experimental work we were able to
identify a total of 445 and quantify 378 metabolites or metabolite
species. This corresponds to 873 unique structures (identified) and
806 unique structures (quantified). A total of 53 compounds or
compound species are being reported here for the first time as
being normal constituents of human urine, while 77 compounds or
compound species are being robustly quantified in human urine
for the first time. All of the metabolites that we experimentally
identified and/or quantified have been added to the UMDB.
Based on the information in the UMDB, our experimentally
acquired data corresponds to 16% of the human urine
metabolome (or 28% if we include probable or putative
metabolites).
Considering the level of coverage, the diversity of chemical
species and the ease with which analyses can be performed, we
have determined that NMR spectroscopy appears to be the
method of choice for global or untargeted metabolomic analysis of
urine. On the other hand, the kit-based combined DFI/LC-MS/
MS methods appear to be optimal for a targeted metabolomic
approach. Using a multi-pronged GC-MS approach for urine
metabolomics appears to be very promising in terms of coverage,
but is not ideal for high-throughput analyses. All methods used in
this study appear to be quite complementary with relatively little
compound overlap. This strongly suggests that if sufficient time
and resources are available, multiple methods should be used in
urine metabolomic studies.
If additional resources had been available, we would have liked
to assess other technologies (GCxGC-MS, FT-MS, isotope
labeled-LC-MS) and to compare the level of metabolite coverage
and chemical diversity attainable with these methods. However,

The Human Urine Metabolome
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 24 September 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 9 | e73076

this study is not intended to be the ‘‘final’’ word on urine or urine
metabolome. Rather, it should be viewed as a starting point for
future studies and future improvements in this field. Indeed, our
primary objective for undertaking these studies and compiling this
data was to help advance the fields of quantitative metabolomics,
especially with regard to clinically important biofluids such as
urine. Experimentally, our data should serve as a useful
benchmark from which to compare other technologies and to
assess coming methodological improvements in human urine
characterization. From a clinical standpoint, we think the
information contained in the human urine metabolome database
(UMDB) should provide metabolomic researchers as well as
clinicians and clinical chemists with a convenient, centralized
resource from which to learn more about human urine and its
unique chemical constituents.
Methods
Ethics Statement
All samples were collected in accordance with the ethical
guidelines mandated by the University of Alberta as approved by
the University’s Health Research Ethics Board. All individuals
were over 18 years of age. All were approached using approved
ethical guidelines and those who agreed to participate in this study
were required to sign consent forms. All participants provided
written consent.
Collection of Urine Samples
Human urine samples (first pass, morning) were collected from
22 healthy adult volunteers (14 male, 8 female) in 120 mL sterile
urine specimen cups. The average age of the volunteers was 30
(range 19–65) for females, and 32 (range 21–67) for males. Upon
receipt (typically within 1 hour of collection), all samples were
immediately treated with sodium azide to a final concentration of
2.5 mM. After centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 10 min to remove
particulate matter, the urine samples were stored in 2 mL aliquots
in falcon tube at 220uC until further use. Prior to each analysis,
the samples were thawed at room temperature for 30 minutes and
filtered for a second time via centrifugation.
NMR Compound Identification and Quantification
All 1
H-NMR spectra were collected on a 500 MHz Inova
(Varian Inc., Palo Alto, CA) spectrometer using the first transient
of the tnnoesy-presaturation pulse sequence. The resulting 1
H￾NMR spectra were processed and analyzed using the Chenomx
NMR Suite Professional software package version 7.0 (Chenomx
Inc., Edmonton, AB), as previously described [17]. Additional
NMR spectra for 39 compounds were added to the Chenomx
Spectral Reference Library using the company’s recommended
spectral acquisition and formatting protocols. Further details on
the NMR sample preparation, NMR data acquisition and the
customized spectral library are provided in Method S1.
GC-MS Compound Identification and Quantification
Twenty-two urine samples were extracted separately to obtain
separate pools of polar, organic acid, bile acid (3 of the 22 urine
samples were chosen for analysis and aliquots from these provided
an additional ‘‘pooled normal’’ sample) and volatile metabolites
using different protocols. The polar metabolites were extracted
with cold HPLC grade methanol and double-distilled water after
pretreatment with urease, followed by derivatization with MSTFA
(N-Methyl-N-trifluoroacetamide) with 1% TMCS (trimethylchlor￾osilane). For organic acids, the ketoacids were converted first to
methoxime derivatives, followed by derivatization with BSTFA
(N,O-Bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide) after two successive
extractions by ethyl acetate and diethyl ether. The bile acids were
eluted with methanol through a SPE column (Bond Elute C18),
followed by two different derivatization steps. First the bile acid
extracts were esterified using 2% sulfuric acid in methanol, then
after phase separation, the esterified bile acids were converted to
the corresponding methyl ester-trimethylsilyl ether derivatives
using MSTFA with 1% TMCS. Each set of extracted/derivatized
metabolites (polar metabolites, organic acids, bile acids) was
separated and analyzed using an Agilent 5890 Series II GC-MS
operating in electron impact (EI) ionization mode.
The volatile compound extraction and analysis by GC-MS was
far different from the other protocols. The pooled urine samples
were acidified using HCl and transferred to a SPME (solid phase
microextraction) vial (75 mm Carboxen/PDMS from Supelco),
and then introducing the SPME fiber assembly into the GC-MS
injector port according to procedures described elsewhere [99],
[100]. The fibers were conditioned prior to use according to the
manufacturer’s instructions by inserting them into the GC injector
port. Further details on the extraction, derivatization, separation
and GC-MS data analysis for the 4 separate groups of urine
metabolites are provided in Method S2.
Direct Flow Injection/LC-MS/MS Compound
Identification and Quantification
To assess the performance of direct flow injection DFI-MS/MS
methods in urine metabolomics and to determine the concentra￾tion ranges of a number of metabolites not measurable by other
methods, we used the commercially available Absolute-IDQ p180
Kit (BIOCRATES Life Sciences AG - Austria). The kit, in
combination with an ABI 4000 Q-Trap (Applied Biosystems/
MDS Sciex) mass spectrometer, can be used for the targeted
identification and quantification of 187 different metabolites or
metabolite species including amino acids, biogenic amines,
creatinine, acylcarnitines, glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids
and hexoses. This method involves derivatization and extraction
of analytes from the biofluid of interest, along with selective mass
spectrometric detection and quantification via multiple reactions
monitoring (MRM). Isotope-labeled internal standards are inte￾grated into the kit plate filter to facilitate metabolite quantification.
Metabolite concentrations were expressed as ratios relative to
creatinine to correct for dilution, assuming a constant rate
creatinine excretion for each urine sample (see Method S3 for
additional information).
Trace Element Analysis Using ICP-MS
Before trace elemental analysis by ICP-MS was performed, 22
urine samples were processed as described previously [101]. The
concentrations of trace elements were determined on a Perkin￾Elmer Sciex Elan 6000 quadrupole ICP-MS operating in a dual
detector mode. Blank subtraction was applied after internal
standard correction (see Method S4 for additional information).
The accuracy of the ICP-MS analytical protocol was periodically
evaluated via the analysis of certified reference standard materials
(whole rock powders) BE-N and DR-N available from the SARM
laboratory at the CRPG (Centre de Recherches Pe´trographiques
et Ge´ologiques).
Characterization of Isoflavones from Urine
We processed 22 urine samples as described previously [102],
[103]. The isoflavones were isolated and concentrated by solid￾phase extraction (Bond Elut C18 column). The elutes were
hydrolyzed enzymatically as the urinary isoflavones occur

predominantly as glucuronate and sulfate conjugates. The analysis
were performed on an Agilent 1100 HPLC system using NovaPak
C18 reversed-phase column connected to Agilent G1315B diode
array detector with signals scanned between 190 and 400 nm (see
Method S5 for additional information).
Characterization of Thiols from Urine
To extract urinary thiols, we derivatized all 22 urine samples as
described previously [104]. A mixture of reagent was used for the
reduction and derivatization (with bromobimane) of thiols. The
derivatized thiols were injected immediately into a hypersil-ODS
HPLC Column connected to Agilent fluorometer operating at an
excitation wavelength of 485 nm and emission wavelength of
510 nm (see Method S6 for additional information).
