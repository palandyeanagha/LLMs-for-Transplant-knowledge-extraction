Abstract
Background: Vasopressin is widely used for vasopressor support in septic shock patients, but experimental
evidence suggests that selective V1A agonists are superior. The initial pharmacodynamic effects, pharmacokinetics,
and safety of selepressin, a novel V1A-selective vasopressin analogue, was examined in a phase IIa trial in septic
shock patients.
Methods: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter trial in 53 patients in early septic
shock (aged ≥18 years, fluid resuscitation, requiring vasopressor support) who received selepressin 1.25 ng/kg/
minute (n = 10), 2.5 ng/kg/minute (n = 19), 3.75 ng/kg/minute (n = 2), or placebo (n = 21) until shock resolution or a
maximum of 7 days. If mean arterial pressure (MAP) ≥65 mmHg was not maintained, open-label norepinephrine
was added. Co-primary endpoints were maintenance of MAP >60 mmHg without norepinephrine, norepinephrine
dose, and proportion of patients maintaining MAP >60 mmHg with or without norepinephrine over 7 days.
Secondary endpoints included cumulative fluid balance, organ dysfunction, pharmacokinetics, and safety.
Results: A higher proportion of the patients receiving 2.5 ng/kg/minute selepressin maintained MAP >60 mmHg
without norepinephrine (about 50% and 70% at 12 and 24 h, respectively) vs. 1.25 ng/kg/minute selepressin and
placebo (p < 0.01). The 7-day cumulative doses of norepinephrine were 761, 659, and 249 μg/kg (placebo 1.25 ng/
kg/minute and 2.5 ng/kg/minute, respectively; 2.5 ng/kg/minute vs. placebo; p < 0.01). Norepinephrine infusion was
weaned more rapidly in selepressin 2.5 ng/kg/minute vs. placebo (0.04 vs. 0.18 μg/kg/minute at 24 h, p < 0.001),
successfully maintaining target MAP and reducing norepinephrine dose vs. placebo (first 24 h, p < 0.001).
Cumulative net fluid balance was lower from day 5 onward in the selepressin 2.5 ng/kg/minute group vs. placebo
(p < 0.05). The selepressin 2.5 ng/kg/minute group had a greater proportion of days alive and free of ventilation vs.
placebo (p < 0.02). Selepressin (2.5 ng/kg/minute) was well tolerated, with a similar frequency of treatment￾emergent adverse events for selepressin 2.5 ng/kg/minute and placebo. Two patients were infused at 3.75 ng/kg/
minute, one of whom had the study drug infusion discontinued for possible safety reasons, with subsequent
discontinuation of this dose group.

Background
Norepinephrine has traditionally been the vasopressor of
choice in the treatment of septic shock, recommended
as the first-line vasopressor in the Surviving Sepsis
Guidelines [1]. However, vasopressin infusion has been
used to replace norepinephrine to maintain adequate
systemic arterial pressure (e.g., in patients refractory to
norepinephrine) [2–4]. In a large, multicenter, random￾ized, double-blind, norepinephrine-controlled trial (the
Vasopressin and Septic Shock Trial [VASST]), vasopres￾sin decreased mortality compared with norepinephrine
in patients with less severe septic shock, although the
overall mortality was not different [5]. The researchers in
the VAsopressin versus Noradrenaline as Initial therapy in
Septic sHock (VANISH) randomized controlled trial of
vasopressin vs. norepinephrine found no differences in
rates of acute kidney injury, the primary endpoint [6].
Vasopressin infusion is currently recommended as a
second-line vasopressor for septic shock in the Surviving
Sepsis Guidelines [1] and is used clinically [7].
Selepressin, a novel, selective vasopressin V1A receptor
agonist, is a potent vasopressor, and it has also been
shown to reduce fluid requirements and limit edema for￾mation in animal septic shock models [8–11] and is now
in clinical development for the treatment of septic
shock. In a phase I first-in-human trial, selepressin infu￾sion in 30 healthy subjects with infusion rates up to
3.0 ng/kg/minute for 6 h showed V1A-agonistic vaso￾pressor properties, was safe and well tolerated, and
showed no signs of vasopressin V2 activity (Ferring Phar￾maceuticals A/S, unpublished data). In this first-in￾patient pilot phase IIa randomized, placebo-controlled
trial, the hypothesis was that selepressin maintains ad￾equate arterial pressure in the absence of norepinephrine
and shortens the duration of organ dysfunction in pa￾tients with early septic shock.
Methods
Study design
This was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized,
placebo-controlled phase IIa trial investigating three as￾cending doses of selepressin in patients with early septic
shock. Patients were recruited into the trial between
2009 and 2011 in Belgium, Denmark, and the United
States in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki
and the principles of good clinical practice. The study
protocol and informed consent documents were ap￾proved by the independent ethics committees or re￾search ethics boards of all participating institutions, and
written informed consent was obtained from all patients,
their next of kin, or another surrogate decision maker as
appropriate prior to enrollment. The study was approved
by the competent regulatory authorities of each country
participating in the trial. An independent data safety and
monitoring committee evaluated the safety of the dose
regimens prior to escalating to the next dose level.
At each dose level, patients were randomized to con￾stant intravenous infusion of selepressin or placebo in a
ratio of 2:1. Open-label norepinephrine was concomi￾tantly administered to maintain the treatment target
MAP of ≥65 mmHg. Study drug infusion continued as
long as arterial pressure support was deemed necessary,
but no longer than 7 days. Patients needing vasopressor
support after 7 days were switched from study drug infu￾sion to norepinephrine or another vasopressor. Assess￾ments were performed during study drug treatment and
up to 4 weeks after study drug initiation.
Study population
Patients with hypotension in early septic shock, defined
as hypotension not responding to infusion of fluid and
requiring at least 0.1 μg/kg/minute norepinephrine for
at least 2 h, with a proven or suspected site of infection
and at least one sign of tissue hypoperfusion (oliguria,
decreased Glasgow Coma Scale score, decreased ratio of
partial pressure arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired
oxygen, or increased arterial blood lactate) could be in￾cluded. To be eligible, patients had to be shifted to the
open-label norepinephrine and randomized to a constant
intravenous infusion of selepressin or placebo within
24 h of meeting the inclusion criteria. Briefly, exclusion
criteria (see Additional file 1: Table S1 for details) were
acute coronary syndrome; hypovolemia suspected on
clinical grounds; cardiac failure; pregnancy or breast￾feeding; hypotension other than septic shock; use of
vasopressin or terlipressin during the current hospital
admission; acute mesenteric ischemia; episode of septic
shock within 1 month; death anticipated within 24 h;
chronic heart disease, including heart failure and sec￾ond- and third-degree atrioventricular block without
pacemaker; hyponatremia; brain injury; burn; peripheral
vascular disease; previously randomized in this trial;

intake of an investigational drug within the last 3 months;
participation in another clinical trial; and considered un￾suitable to participate in the trial for any other reason.
Sample size and randomization
The study design comprised four treatment cohorts at
three ascending infusion rate levels, the first three co￾horts with ten receiving active treatment and five receiv￾ing placebo. The last cohort comprised active and
placebo to finally reach 20 patients at the maximum tol￾erated infusion level and 20 patients receiving placebo.
The randomization process was a computer-generated
random listing of the treatment allocations, stratified by
center and in variable permuted blocks of 2, 4, or 6.
Infusion of study drug and norepinephrine
The investigated starting and maximal infusion rates of
selepressin were 1.25 ng/kg/minute, 2.5 ng/kg/minute,
and 3.75 ng/kg/minute, with the patient’s body weight
being measured or estimated. Selepressin or placebo was
infused via a central venous catheter at the constant ini￾tial rate in addition to open-label norepinephrine target￾ing a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of ≥65 mmHg.
When patients were hemodynamically stable, open-label
norepinephrine was tapered while maintaining target
MAP with study drug. When the MAP was stable for
4 h without norepinephrine, study drug was weaned
stepwise according to the protocol (Additional file 1:
Table S2). If weaning resulted in hemodynamic instabil￾ity, the study drug was reinstituted, and, if needed,
open-label norepinephrine was restarted. Open-label nor￾epinephrine was adjusted to maintain the MAP
≥65 mmHg if blinded study drug was insufficient. Patients
received study drug until shock resolution (i.e., no vaso￾pressor support) or a maximum of 7 days unless discon￾tinued for safety reasons (Additional file 1: Table S3).
Open-label norepinephrine was supplied in the United
States and Canada as norepinephrine bitartrate 1 mg/ml
(Levophed, norepinephrine base; Hospira, Lake Forest,
IL, USA) diluted in 5% dextrose and in Europe as
Norepinephrine 1:1000 (norepinephrine tartrate;
(Cardinal Health Ltd., Basingstoke, UK) 2 mg/ml (1 mg/
ml norepinephrine base) diluted in 5% glucose. A tight
protocol and accurate pumps (Braun Perfusor® Space; B.
Braun Melsungen AG, Melsungen, Germany) were used
to calculate open-label norepinephrine delivered.
Study outcomes
The co-primary endpoints were stabilization of MAP as
determined by proportion of patients maintaining a
MAP >60 mmHg without open-label norepinephrine at
12, 24, 48, and 96 h, and day 7; infusion rates and cumu￾lative dose of open-label norepinephrine; and proportion
of patients maintaining a MAP >60 mmHg at 12, 24, 48,
and 96 h, and day 7, regardless of open-label norepin￾ephrine administration. The limit for maintained MAP
was defined as 60 mmHg to prevent small variations
around the clinical treatment target of 65 mmHg having
disproportional impact on the overall evaluation.
Secondary endpoints included pharmacodynamics,
pharmacokinetics, safety (vital signs, central venous
pressure, central venous oxygen saturation, electrocar￾diographic and cardiac function, respiratory function,
clinical chemistry, hematology, hemostasis, and urinaly￾sis), organ dysfunction, an indirect measure of vascular
leakage (i.e., fluid balance), and morbidity. Treatment￾emergent adverse events (occurrence from start of study
drug to 48 h after infusion was stopped) were collated
and evaluated. Morbidity and organ dysfunction were
evaluated by time course of Sequential Organ Failure
Assessment (SOFA) scores; days alive and free of organ
dysfunction (using SOFA); proportion of patients off all
vasopressors; days alive and out of intensive care unit
(ICU); days alive and free of vasopressors; corticoste￾roids for sepsis treatment, dialysis, or mechanical venti￾lation at days 7, 14, and 28; ICU and hospital (up to day
28) lengths of stay; and plasma C-reactive protein (CRP),
tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10,
and IL-1ra levels.
Pharmacokinetics
Because the study drug infusion was administered ac￾cording to need, the pharmacokinetic parameters steady￾state concentration, total systemic clearance, distribution
volume at steady state, and half-life were calculated by
modeling using a two-compartment population pharma￾cokinetic model with random subject effects on clear￾ance and distribution volume using WinNonlin®Pro
(Pharsight Corp., Cary, NC, USA). Actual blood sam￾pling time points were used for the calculations.
Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using SAS version
9.2 for Windows software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC,
USA). The first two co-primary endpoints were compared
using a logistic regression model. The rates and cumula￾tive amounts of open-label norepinephrine administered
were compared between treatment groups by using a re￾peated measures analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model
with treatment, time, and treatment by time interaction as
factors; baseline rate of norepinephrine as a covariate; and
subject as the experimental unit. The analyses were done
for both the full analysis set and the per-protocol analysis
set. For both analysis sets, the analyses were presented for
the whole analysis set and those alive (and not discontin￾ued) at the time of the measurement. The selepressin
groups were compared individually with the placebo
group in an analysis of variance model.
Russell et al. Critical Care (2017) 21:213 Page 3 of 10

Changes in vascular leakage endpoints (i.e., fluid bal￾ance), as well as changes from baseline in cytokines and
SOFA scores, were compared between treatment groups
using the same ANCOVA model as for norepinephrine.
Patients were categorized as free of organ dysfunction if
all six individual SOFA scores were 0. Percentage days
alive and free of organ dysfunction/ICU/hospital (i.e.,
number of days/7 observation days × 100) were analyzed
between treatment groups using nonparametric
Wilcoxon tests. The treatment differences between the
selepressin groups and placebo were estimated using the
Hodges-Lehmann estimator for independent samples. The
proportions of patients alive were analyzed between treat￾ment groups on days 7, 14, and 28 using a logistic regres￾sion model. Confidence intervals (Clopper-Pearson) were
calculated for mortality rates and for the ORs of mortality
rates.
Results
Study population
Fifty-three patients were randomized, and 52 subjects
were dosed; 10 subjects received 1.25 ng/kg/minute, 19
subjects received 2.5 ng/kg/minute, 2 subjects received
3.75 ng/kg/minute, and 21 subjects received placebo. All
randomized patients were included in the intention-to￾treat dataset. Two patients were infused at 3.75 ng/kg/
minute, one of whom had the study drug infusion dis￾continued for possible safety reasons, with subsequent
discontinuation of this dose group. Owing to the small
sample size and short duration of infusion in this group,
efficacy analyses were not possible. A Consolidated Stan￾dards of Reporting Trials diagram of the study is shown
in Fig. 1.
There were essentially no differences between sele￾pressin- and placebo-treated patients in baseline charac￾teristics, apart from a lower baseline norepinephrine
dose in the 1.25 ng/kg/minute than in the 2.5 ng/kg/mi￾nute and placebo groups (Table 1). The most common
underlying organ dysfunctions were gastrointestinal,
metabolic and nutritional, respiratory, and renal
(Table 1). The primary infection was predominantly ab￾dominal (40%) or pulmonary (31%).
MAPs during the 7-day assessment period were simi￾lar between groups at approximately 70 mmHg initially
and increasing over 2 days to approximately 80–
85 mmHg (Additional file 1: Figure S1).
Effect of selepressin on norepinephrine requirement and
duration of septic shock
The mean total selepressin infused doses were 6.1 and
8.7 μg/kg infused over 3.6 and 3.2 days in the 1.25 and
2.5 ng/kg/minute dose groups, respectively. The swift
Fig. 1 Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) diagram of patient flow through the study

onset of action of selepressin was illustrated by the high
proportion of patients receiving 2.5 ng/kg/minute sele￾pressin who early on maintained MAP >60 mmHg with￾out norepinephrine (about 50% at 12 h and 70% at 24 h)
(Fig. 2). In contrast, in the placebo and 1.25 ng/kg/mi￾nute selepressin groups, no patient was free of norepin￾ephrine at 12 h and ≤20% were free of norepinephrine at
24 h (p < 0.01). However, over time, the differences de￾creased as more patients recovered also in the latter
groups.
The 7-day baseline adjusted mean cumulative doses of
open-label norepinephrine were 761, 659, and 249 μg/kg
for the placebo, 1.25 ng/kg/minute, and 2.5 ng/kg/mi￾nute groups, respectively (p < 0.001 for 2.5 ng/kg/minute
vs. placebo groups) (Fig. 3a). Furthermore, the
norepinephrine mean infusion rate was initially reduced
more rapidly in the selepressin 2.5 ng/kg/minute group
than in the placebo group; at 24 h, the infusion rates
were 0.04 vs. 0.18 μg/kg/minute (p < 0.005) (Fig. 3b).
As expected, there were no differences between treat￾ment groups in the proportions of patients who main￾tained MAP >60 mmHg regardless of norepinephrine,
meaning that the patients were generally treated equally
(Additional file 1: Table S4). Selepressin at 2.5 ng/kg/mi￾nute appeared to result in a faster recovery from shock
(off vasopressors, including selepressin) than 1.25 ng/kg/
minute and placebo, but without statistical significance
(58% vs. 29%, p = 0.11, at 48 h) (Additional file 1: Figures
S2 and S3). There was no significant difference between
groups in 28-day mortality rates (placebo 4 [21%] of 19,

2.5 ng/kg/minute 1 [5%] of 19).
Effect of selepressin on mechanical ventilation, fluid
balance, and other morbidity
The proportion of days alive and free of ventilation was
greater in the selepressin 2.5 ng/kg/minute group than
in the placebo group (54% vs. 23%, p < 0.02) over the 7-
day treatment period. There was no difference between
the 1.25 ng/kg/minute (31%) and placebo groups (Add￾itional file 1: Figure S4).
Selepressin at 2.5 ng/kg/minute decreased the cumula￾tive net fluid balance over the treatment period com￾pared with the 1.25 ng/kg/minute and placebo groups
(from about 9 L to 6.5 L, p = 0.1) (Fig. 4), and compared
with placebo, the difference was significant (p < 0.05)
from day 5 (94 h) onward. The differences in fluid bal￾ance appeared to be due to fluid input rather than to
urine output because there were no differences between
groups in urine output (Additional file 1: Figure S5).
There were no significant differences between groups
in length of stay in the ICU or hospital up to 28 days; in
plasma CRP, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10, or IL-1ra levels; or in
any other secondary morbidity endpoint.
Pharmacokinetics
The mean steady-state concentrations of selepressin
(0.50 and 0.99 ng/ml) were proportional to the initial in￾fusion rates of 1.25 and 2.5 μg/kg/minute, with a time to
steady-state concentration of approximately 7 h. The
modeled mean total systemic clearance values were 10.0
and 13.1 L/h, respectively, increasing with body weight
and being higher in men than in women. The terminal
half-life was approximately 2.5 h in both dose groups,

with an initial distribution/elimination phase half-life of
approximately 10 minutes. The distribution volume at
steady state was 18–31 L, indicating extravascular distri￾bution (Additional file 1: Table S5).
Safety
Selepressin was well tolerated, with no difference be￾tween selepressin dose groups and placebo in terms
of treatment-emergent adverse events. The high-dose
group was stopped after two patients because of po￾tential adverse events in the second patient. The most
frequent adverse events were atrial fibrillation, brady￾cardia, and hypertension (six subjects on seven occa￾sions), equally distributed across treatment groups.
The severe treatment-emergent adverse events were
generally single observations attributable to the
underlying disease (Additional file 1: Table S6). Nine
treatment-emergent adverse events (in eight subjects)
were regarded by the investigator to be related to
treatment; one, four, and four treatment-emergent ad￾verse events were regarded as mild, moderate, and se￾vere, respectively (Table 2). Four of the adverse drug
reactions in three patients were judged as serious:
myocarditis and peripheral ischemia (one patient in
the 2.5 ng/kg/minute group), myocardial ischemia
(3.75 ng/kg/minute group), and atrial fibrillation (pla￾cebo group). There were no deaths related to ische￾mic event(s) attributable to selepressin.
There were no regional or global signs of hypoper￾fusion, as suggested by similar decreases of lactate
levels (Additional file 1: Figure S5) and serum creatin￾ine (Additional file 1: Figure S6), with no significant
differences between study groups during the treat￾ment period.
Discussion
In this phase IIa trial in patients in septic shock, the se￾lective V1A agonist selepressin was shown to be an ef￾fective vasopressor because infusion of 2.5 ng/kg/minute
maintained an adequate MAP, increased the proportion
of patients weaned off norepinephrine during the first
24 h, and decreased the mean cumulative dose of nor￾epinephrine, thus demonstrating rapid onset and sus￾tained activity. Moreover, 2.5 ng/kg/minute selepressin
could possibly mitigate lung dysfunction because it was
associated with a higher proportion of days alive and
free of ventilation over 7 days than placebo. It is well
known that long duration of mechanical ventilation in￾creases the risk of nosocomial pneumonia, neuromuscu￾lar weakness, and death. Also, although not statistically
significant, twice as many patients were out of shock
within 48 h with selepressin 2.5 ng/kg/minute compared
with placebo, suggesting potential clinical benefit. Thus,
selepressin appears to shorten duration of shock and the
time with mechanical ventilation and may be expected
to potentially improve the overall treatment outcome.
Increased vascular leakage due to increased endothelial
permeability in septic shock results in edema and organ
dysfunction, and increased positive net fluid balance is
directly associated with long duration of mechanical
ventilation [12] and increased mortality in sepsis and
septic shock [13–15]. An indirect marker of vascular lea￾kage—cumulative fluid balance over 7 days—was lower
with selepressin 2.5 ng/kg/minute than with placebo, a
result that is consistent with animal models of septic
shock [8–11]. In a prospective randomized study in an
ovine Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia model of
septic shock of selepressin vs. Vasopressin, researchers
found that selepressin blocked vascular leak better than
vasopressin did and that the decreased vascular leakage

was reversed by adding the V2 agonist ddAVP to sele￾pressin [9]. Taken together, these results suggest that se￾lective vasopressin V1A agonism may protect against
increased vascular leakage in septic shock.
The V1A-selective activity of selepressin may also have
other advantages compared with nonselective vasopres￾sin agonists in septic shock. Terlipressin is more of a
V1A receptor agonist than vasopressin, but it is also a
V1B and V2 receptor agonist, whereas selepressin is a
highly selective V1A receptor agonist. In contrast to
vasopressin and terlipressin, selepressin does not activate
the vasopressin V2 receptors that are mediating anti￾diuretic effects [16], release of von Willebrand factor
[16, 17], and vasodilation by stimulation of nitric oxide
production [18, 19], all of which might be harmful dur￾ing septic shock due to exacerbation of oliguria, procoa￾gulation, and vasodilation.
Selepressin at 1.25 ng/kg/minute had only very limited
pressor effects, suggesting that 2.5 ng/kg/minute was re￾quired for an effective discontinuation of norepinephrine
infusion. There was no difference between selepressin
dose groups and placebo in terms of treatment￾emergent adverse events. However, the highest-dose
group was stopped after two patients because of adverse
events in one of the patients that were regarded to be
possibly related to selepressin. Because selepressin
3.75 ng/kg/minute was discontinued following only two
patients with short infusion times, it was not possible to
assess the safety and efficacy of this dose. However,
3.75 ng/kg/minute and higher infusion rates did not
raise any safety concerns in a separate uncontrolled,
multicenter, open-label trial in which all 30 patients re￾ceived selepressin at infusion rates of 3.75 ng/kg/minute
and higher (Ferring Pharmaceuticals A/S, unpublished
data). Further assessment of the safety and efficacy of sele￾pressin (at infusion rates of 1.7–7.5 ng/kg/minute) vs. pla￾cebo is currently ongoing in the phase IIb/III Selepressin
Evaluation Programme for Sepsis-Induced Shock -
Adaptive Clinical Trial (SEPSIS-ACT; clinicaltrials.gov/
ct2/show/NCT02508649?term = selepressin&rank = 1).
Selepressin clearance was about 30% lower in septic
shock patients than in healthy subjects. Because pep￾tides similar in size are eliminated predominantly by
peptidase degradation and excretion in the kidney,
the decreased clearance in septic shock may be ex￾plained by reduced renal function. Accordingly, the
terminal half-life of selepressin was longer in septic
shock patients (2.5 h) than in healthy subjects (1.5 h)
(Ferring Pharmaceuticals, unpublished data). The lon￾ger half-life of selepressin than of norepinephrine
would potentially limit rapid adjustment of the
selepressin-induced vasopressor support, especially
after steady state has been established. However, the
selepressin initial distribution/elimination phase half￾life was short (10 minutes), enabling rapid selepressin
dose adjustment during the early phase. Weaning of
vasopressor support is generally not rapid; there were
no indications that the terminal half-life caused un￾due vasopressor-related events. In comparison with
vasopressin (short half-life) and terlipressin (long half-life)
[20, 21], selepressin’s half-life is intermediate [22, 23].
Infusion of selepressin at 2.5 ng/kg/minute appeared
safe and was well tolerated, as shown by the similar
frequency of treatment-emergent adverse events in
the selepressin at 2.5 ng/kg/minute and placebo
groups. The treatment-emergent adverse events re￾lated to selepressin could generally be attributed to
vasoconstriction and were similar in the selepressin
and placebo groups, as were occurrence of severe and
serious adverse events. There were no differences be￾tween groups in indirect markers of regional or global
signs of hypoperfusion (lactate and serum creatinine
levels). The pooled mortality of the selepressin groups
was 20%, very similar to the 21% placebo group mor￾tality rate and consistent with mortality rates in re￾cent trials in septic shock [24]. The small sample size
and the wide variability in clinical presentations and
outcomes of septic shock prevented any conclusions
on mortality, but none of the deaths was regarded as
related to selepressin.
This was the first trial in patients, and the overall
goal of the trial was to determine whether and to
what degree selepressin could decrease the dose of
norepinephrine in septic patients requiring vasopres￾sor support. Reducing the dose of norepinephri￾ne—so-called “de-catecholaminization” [25]—could in
itself be advantageous because it could decrease the
adverse effects of norepinephrine, including excessive
prearteriolar vasoconstriction (compared with vaso￾pressin [26] and possibly selepressin) and tachyar￾rhythmias; it could have beneficial effects on fluid
balance and vascular leak [8, 9]; and it could possibly
have more adverse effects on immunity [27] than
selepressin’s selective V1A agonism.
It remains to be determined whether rapid and full
substitution of norepinephrine with selepressin is su￾perior to cotreatment with norepinephrine and sele￾pressin. That will be assessed in the ongoing phase
IIb/III SEPSIS-ACT trial. The combination of vaso￾pressin and norepinephrine possesses synergistic ef￾fects, and the two different modes of action together
may be superior to aiming to reach target MAP fully
with either strategy alone. However, the potential add￾itional benefits of selepressin compared with vaso￾pressin, such as reduction of capillary leakage and
lack of V2-mediated antidiuresis and procoagulation
activity, may justify earlier use and fuller substitution
of norepinephrine with selepressin.

Strengths and weaknesses of this trial
Strengths of this trial include the randomized, concealed,
placebo-controlled design; generalizability (multicenter
in Europe and North America); precision of the co￾primary endpoints; the inclusion of patients with rela￾tively early septic shock; the novel selective V1A agonist
selepressin; and administration of a tight protocol in
critically ill septic shock patients. Limitations of this trial
include the small sample size due to the early stage in
selepressin’s clinical development in a limited number of
centers (that may limit the overall impact), but they were
suitable for initial assessment of selepressin in human
septic shock. The fluid input was not controlled, and we
do not have information about the different solutions
used (crystalloids, colloids, blood products), which
might, at least in part, have influenced the amount of in￾fused fluids, a potential limitation in interpreting the
fluid balance. Although the addition of selepressin
allowed sparing of norepinephrine and some would
argue that one is simply substituting one vasopressor
(selepressin) for another (norepinephrine), the beneficial
effects on ventilation and fluid balance suggest add￾itional nonvasopressor benefits of selepressin vs. nor￾epinephrine. The pharmacodynamic effects of
selepressin should be interpreted with caution owing to
the small sample size of this phase IIa trial. We did not
measure cardiac output, so we cannot comment on sele￾pressin vs. norepinephrine effects on this parameter. Of
note, vasopressin and norepinephrine had similar
effects—no decrease in cardiac output in VASST [28].
Interaction of vasopressin and corticosteroids has been
reported elsewhere, but owing to the small sample size,
it was not possible to assess the potential interaction of
corticosteroids and selepressin in this trial.
Conclusions
The novel selective vasopressin V1A receptor agonist sele￾pressin at an infusion rate of 2.5 ng/kg/minute rapidly re￾placed norepinephrine while maintaining target MAP and
may have improved fluid balance and shortened the time
of mechanical ventilation. Further studies of selepressin’s
mechanism of action and additional larger randomized
controlled trials to investigate its efficacy are needed and
ongoing to assess its ability to improve the treatment out￾come of patients in septic shock.
