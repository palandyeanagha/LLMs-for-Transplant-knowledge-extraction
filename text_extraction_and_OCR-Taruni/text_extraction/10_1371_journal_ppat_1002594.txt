Abstract
The mechanism underlying persistent hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains unclear. We investigated the role of innate
immune responses to persistent HBV infection in 154 HBV-infected patients and 95 healthy controls. The expression of
NKG2D- and 2B4-activating receptors on NK cells was significantly decreased, and moreover, the expression of DAP10 and
SAP, the intracellular adaptor proteins of NKG2D and 2B4 (respectively), were lower, which then impaired NK cell-mediated
cytotoxic capacity and interferon-c production. Higher concentrations of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-b1) were
found in sera from persistently infected HBV patients. TGF-b1 down-regulated the expression of NKG2D and 2B4 on NK cells
in our in vitro study, leading to an impairment of their effector functions. Anti-TGF-b1 antibodies could restore the
expression of NKG2D and 2B4 on NK cells in vitro. Furthermore, TGF-b1 induced cell-cycle arrest in NK cells by up-regulating
the expression of p15 and p21 in NK cells from immunotolerant (IT) patients. We conclude that TGF-b1 may reduce the
expression of NKG2D/DAP10 and 2B4/SAP, and those IT patients who are deficient in these double-activating signals have
impaired NK cell function, which is correlated with persistent HBV infection.

Introduction
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infects more than 350 million people
worldwide, accounting for over 1 million deaths annually due to
immune-mediated chronic liver damage [1–3]. The course of
HBV infection is complicated. Three phases of chronic HBV
(CHB) infection are now widely accepted: 1) an immune tolerant
(IT) phase, characterised by an HBV DNA concentration
.200,000 IU/mL, normal alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels,
normal liver biopsy or only minimal inflammation and perinatal
infection of infants born to HBsAg/HBeAg-positive mothers; 2) an
immune active (IA) phase, which is also referred to as the ‘‘chronic
hepatitis B phase’’ or the ‘‘immune clearance phase’’, charac￾terised by an HBV DNA concentration .20,000 IU/mL, elevated
ALT levels and active hepatic inflammation on biopsy; and 3) an
inactive (IN) phase, characterised by HBV DNA levels
,2000 IU/mL, normal ALT levels and minimal or absent
hepatic inflammation [4]. During the IA phase, the immune
system of the host recognises the virus as foreign and initiates the
immune clearance response, which results in hepatocyte damage.
After one or more episodes of reactivation to the IA phase, patients
begin the IN phase [5–7]. Patients in the IT phase have normal
ALT levels and elevated levels of HBV DNA, commonly well
above 1 million IU/mL; this phase can last anywhere from a few
to .30 years [8]. The IT phase has been suggested to occur most
frequently in patients who were infected via perinatal transmission
from HBeAg-positive mothers [9]. In China, approximately 2
million infants are infected with HBV via perinatal transmission
from HBsAg/HBeAg-positive mothers annually, and many of
them are at high risk of developing chronic liver inflammation
resulting in cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in later
life [10–13]. The risk of developing HCC with HBV infection is
higher in East Asian countries than in Western countries, possibly
due to the frequency of earlier viral infection [14]. During the IT
phase of CHB infection, the virus evolves strategies to evade
immune clearance in the majority of patients. However, the
tolerance mechanism of the IT phase has not been widely studied.
Due to their normal ALT levels, there is no available treatment to
reduce the very high HBV DNA levels or alleviate psychological
pressure in IT-phase patients. The development of an anti-HBV
therapy for such patients will require insight into the mechanisms
of HBV persistence.
The innate immune system provides the first line of defence in
antiviral responses and activates adaptive immune responses. NK
cells have been viewed as the most important effectors of the initial
antiviral innate immune system [15–16]. Previous investigations
have demonstrated that NK cells may be particularly important in
patients with CHB. NK cells are highly enriched in the liver, and
the site of HBV replication, and they are partially functionally
tolerant in CHB [13,17]. The substantial quantity of NK cells in

the liver suggests that they act as ‘‘watcher cells’’, surveying the
liver for indications of cellular stress and implying that HBV has to
evade NK cell-mediated immune responses to establish a
persistent viral infection. The evidence shows that the cytotoxic
capacity of NK cells is retained. Moreover, the activation of NK
cells and the secretion of IFN-c are strongly inhibited during CHB
infection [18]. Blockage of IL-10 with or without TGF-b1 can
restore the capacity of NK cells to produce the antiviral cytokine
IFN-c in CHB patients [19]. NKG2D, the activating receptor of
NK cells, is constitutively expressed on human NK cells and CD8+
T cells [20]. The importance of the NKG2D pathway is
highlighted by evidence that tumours and viruses have developed
distinct escape mechanisms to avoid NKG2D-mediated recogni￾tion [21–26]. The signalling lymphocyte activation molecule
(SLAM)-related receptor 2B4 is predominantly expressed on
human NK cells and CD8+ T cells. The immunoregulatory role
of 2B4 as an activating or inhibitory receptor depends on three
factors: 1) surface expression, because costimulatory qualities are
associated with low expression and inhibitory qualities are
associated with high expression; 2) the coexpression of additional
inhibitory molecules; and 3) the presence of the intracellular
adaptor protein SLAM-associated protein (SAP) [18,27–30].
NKG2D and 2B4 are the main triggering receptors of NK cells
[31]. Many studies have provided evidence for a functional
dichotomy in patients with chronic HBV that may contribute to
virus persistence [32]. NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity is efficiently
initiated by the NKG2D activation signal on NK cells. NKG2D
recognises pressure-induced antigen signals on a target cell,
whereas 2B4 receives the costimulatory signal. Therefore, these
two molecules play a key role in NK cell activation and function.
The tolerance mechanism of HBV persistence and the contribu￾tion of the NKG2D/DAP10 and 2B4/SAP pathways to the
control of persistent HBV infection are unclear. Here, we show
that NKG2D/DAP10 and 2B4/SAP are down-regulated on
circulating NK cells and are associated with the impaired
functionally of NK cells in IT-phase patients. Moreover, this
defect is mediated by TGF-b1, which causes NK cell-cycle arrest
by inducing high expression of p15 and p21. These findings may
contribute to our understanding of immune tolerance mechanisms
and may aid in the development of novel therapeutic methods to
clear the viral infection during the initial phase.
Results
Expression levels of NKG2D and 2B4 on circulating NK
cells were decreased during the IT phase of hepatitis B
virus infection
The multiple functions of NK cells, such as cytotoxicity and
cytokine secretion, can be induced through interactions between
inhibitory and activating NK receptors and their respective ligands
[15]. NKG2D is constitutively expressed on NK cells and is one of
the main triggering receptors of NK cells. NK cell-mediated
cytotoxicity is efficiently initiated by engaging the NKG2D￾DAP10 receptor complex on NK cells [31]. To explore the
effector potential of NK cells during persistent HBV infection, we
first analysed the frequency of NKG2D expression on NK cells in
93 patients with HBV infection compared to 63 healthy gender￾and age-matched controls. Due to the restricted availability of
fresh, persistently HBV-infected liver samples from which to
isolate infiltrating NK cells, we examined the expression of
NKG2D on circulating NK cells. HBV-infected patients were
classified into three phases based on their natural histories: the IT
phase, the IA phase and the IN hepatitis B phase [4,33–34]. The
proportion of circulating NKG2D+ NK cells was significantly
decreased in patients in the IT phase relative to healthy controls
(P,0.0001) and patients in either the IA phase (P = 0.04) or the IN
(P = 0.001) phase (Figure 1.A, B). The proportion of total NK cells
in IT-phase patients was also lower than in CHB patients in other
phases or in healthy controls (Figure S3.B). More importantly, we
observed that both the percentage of circulating NKG2D￾expressing NK cells and the absolute count of NKG2D+ NK cells
were significantly lower in IT-phase patients than in healthy
controls (P,0.0001) or patients in the IN (P = 0.019) but not
patients in the IA (P = 0.303) (Figure 1.D).
To explore whether other activating NK receptors were
expressed at low levels in the IT patients, we quantified another
NK cell-activating receptor, 2B4, using flow cytometry. The
proportion of circulating 2B4+ NK cells displayed significantly
lower levels in the IT patients than in healthy controls (P,0.0001)
and in patients in the IN (P = 0.022) (Figure 1.A, C). Similarly, the
absolute number of 2B4-expressing NK cells in patients in the IT
phase was lower than in healthy controls (P,0.0001) (Figure 1.E).
Upon further analysis, a linear relationship was observed between
the percentage of 2B4 and NKG2D on NK cells (r = 0.7695,
P,0.0001) (Figure 1.F). We also analysed the frequency of the
expression of other NK cell activation receptors (NKp30, NKp44,
NKp46, CD16, CD27 and CD226) on circulating NK cells from
healthy controls and CHB patients, but there were no significant
differences in their expression levels on NK cells between patients
and healthy controls (Figure S2.A,B). The levels of NKG2D and
2B4 did not correlate with age, HBV viral load or ALT/AST
levels (data not shown), and NKG2D (P = 0.0112) and 2B4
(P = 0.0101) expression levels were lower in females than males
(Figure S3.A).
NKG2D and 2B4 reductions in IT patients are associated
with deficient NK cell function
The activation of NK cells depends on the integration of signals
from co-activation receptors, and the cytotoxic effects of NK cells
on target cells are tempered by a request for combined signals
from multiple activating receptors, such as NKG2D and 2B4
[16,35–36]. Therefore, we hypothesised that these phenotypic
changes might be paralleled by functional alterations in NK cells.
Author Summary
NK cells have been viewed as the most important effectors
of the initial antiviral innate immune response. Their
activation depends on the integration of signals from ‘‘co￾activation’’ receptors, and the cytotoxic effects of NK cells
on target cells are tempered by a need for combined
signals from multiple activating receptors, such as NKG2D
and 2B4. In this study, we showed that NKG2D and 2B4
expression levels were decreased on NK cells from patients
in the IT phase of HBV infection. We further demonstrated
that lower levels of intracellular adaptor proteins (DAP10
and SAP) were associated with lower surface expression of
NKG2D and 2B4. As a result, the synergistically co-activated
signalling pathway initiated by NKG2D and 2B4 did not
operate properly in IT-phase patients. We demonstrated
that high levels of soluble TGF-b1 were associated with the
reduction of NKG2D and 2B4 in patients. In addition, we
showed that TGF-b1 causes the cell-cycle arrest of NK cells
by up-regulating the levels of p15 and p21 in NK cells from
IT patients. Collectively, these findings may contribute to
our understanding of the immune tolerance mechanism
and aid in the development of novel therapeutic methods
to clear HBV infection during the initial phase.

To determine whether NK cells in IT-phase patients have an
intrinsic defect in cytolytic activity, NK cell cytotoxicity was
evaluated by measuring the lysis of 51Cr-labelled K562 cells. To
ensure that there was no other cellular factor that could influence
NK cell cytotoxicity, we purified NK cells from PBMCs by
negative selection. IT-phase patients were deficient in K562
killing compared to healthy controls and patients in the IA or IN
phase (Figure 2.A). Across multiple evaluations, the IT patients
had a mean of 23.665.5% K562 lysis at a 5:1 E:T ratio
compared with 51.467.7% for the controls (P = 0.0384). No
significant difference in NK cell cytotoxicity was detectable
between patients in the IA or IN phases and healthy controls
(Figure 2.B). These data demonstrate that patients in the IT
phase have a specific defect in NK cell cytotoxic activity.
Furthermore, a positive correlation was observed between the
cytotoxicity of NK cells and the percentage of NKG2D+
NK cells
(r = 0.7264) and the percentage of 2B4+
NK cells (r = 0.4183)
(Figure 2.C). To further evaluate the potential function of NK
cells in IT-phase patients, we examined their capacity to produce
cytokines by measuring IFN-c expression following stimulation
with IL-12. There was a significant reduction in the production of
IFN-c produced by NK cells from patients in the IT phase
compared with healthy controls and IA- and IN-phase patients
(Figure 2.D, E). There was also no change in T-bet expression in
NK cells from patients and healthy controls (Figure S4.A, B).
To further determine whether the defect in NK cell function
could be reversed during antiviral therapy, PBMCs from patients
at the onset of inflammation and after treatment were stimulated
with IL-12 for 16 h, and IFN-c, and CD107a production was
determined. As shown in Figure 2, the production of IFN-c (F) and
CD107a (G) was higher in NK cells from patients after treatment
compared with before treatment, suggesting that NK cell function
could be reversed by antiviral therapy. To further validate this
hypothesis, ex vivo NK cell cytotoxicity against K562 cells was
measured (Figure 2.H). Our results demonstrated that NK cell
cytotoxic activity was strengthened after antiviral therapy. These
results suggest that in vivo administration of nucleoside analogues
partially overcomes the deficit in NK cell function in CHB
patients.
Reduced expression of DAP10 and SAP on NK cells from
IT-phase patients
We observed that both the percentage and the absolute count of
NKG2D and 2B4 were decreased on circulating NK cells during
IT-phase HBV infection. We then asked whether the decreased
expression of activating receptors on NK cells was paralleled by
functional alterations. There is a consensus that the NKG2D￾DAP10 receptor complex on human NK cells efficiently initiates
cell-mediated cytotoxicity [31]. When NK cells encounter target
cells expressing CD48, the 2B4-SAP–Fyn complex is responsible
for the activation of NK cells. To test this hypothesis, we measured
the expression of the intracellular adaptor protein DAP10 and the
two members of the SAP family of adaptors that are expressed in
humans: SAP (also known as SH2D1A or DSHP) and Ewing’s
sarcoma-activated transcript-2 (EAT-2, also known as SH2D1B).
The mRNA expression levels of DAP10, SAP and EAT-2 in NK
cells were investigated in HBV patients and compared to healthy
controls. As shown in Figure 3.A., our results demonstrated that
the mRNA expression levels of DAP10 and SAP were lower in NK
cells from IT patients than in those from IA patients and healthy
controls; there were no differences between IA patients and
healthy controls. Moreover, there were no significant differences in
EAT-2 mRNA expression levels in NK cells between patients and
healthy controls. To further investigate the signalling potential of
activating NKRs within NK cells, we assessed the protein
expression levels of DAP10 and SAP in NK cells. Due to having
access to limited numbers of NK cells from blood samples, we
investigated the expression of DAP10 and SAP in NK cells by
immunofluorescence. As shown in Figure 3.B, we found fewer
DAP10+ NK cells in samples from IT-phase patients than in those
from patients in other phases and healthy controls. The proportion
and absolute numbers of circulating DAP10+ NK cells were also
lower in the IT patients compared with the patients in other
phases and healthy controls (Figure 3.C, D). No significant
differences in DAP10+ NK cells were detectable between patients
in the IA and IN phases (Figure 3.C, D). Upon further analysis, the
percentages of SAP-expressing NK cells were similar in HBV
patients and healthy controls (.95% of NK cells in all four
groups). However, a decreased MFI was detected in SAP+ NK
cells from IT patients compared with healthy controls and IA or
IN patients (Figure 3.G). No significant difference in SAP+ NK
cells was detectable between patients in the IA and IN phases
(Figure 3.F, G). Furthermore, to verify whether SAP proteins were
reduced or not, we examined the expression of SAP in NK cells
using western blotting (Figure S5). Our new data demonstrated
that considerably low levels of SAP on NK cells from IT patient
samples and relatively low levels of SAP in IA, IN patients
compared with healthy controls. These data suggest that the loss of
NKG2D+ and 2B4+ NK cells in IT patients may be accompanied
by the loss of DAP10+ and SAP+ NK cells. To verify whether this
phenomenon was associated with functional consequences, we
specifically silenced DAP10 (si-DAP10) or SAP (si-SAP) in NK92
cells using RNA interference (RNAi). As shown in Figure 4A, B,
the mRNA expression levels of DAP10 and SAP on NK92 cells
were significantly lower after transfection with either siRNA.
Furthermore, we chose siR-SAP-214 and siR-DAP-501 to
investigate the functional consequences. As expected, compared
with NK92 cells transfected with the negative control siRNA
(siR.NC), NK92 cells transfected with either DAP10 siRNA (siR￾DAP) or SAP siRNA (siR-SAP) resulted in a much stronger
deficiency in NK cell cytotoxicity (Figure 4.D). These results
demonstrate that DAP10 and SAP, at least in part, mediate the
effects of NK92 cell cytotoxicity.
Down-regulation of the synergistic activation of Ca2+ flux
by co-crosslinking NKG2D and 2B4 in primary NK cells
from IT patients
To evaluate the functional consequences of the reduction of the
double-activating signals (NKG2D and 2B4), secondary cross￾linking goat anti-mouse F(ab’)2 antibody was added to NK cells

obtained from fresh peripheral blood samples and preincubated
with activated mAbs for NKG2D and 2B4 to investigate the
mobilisation of Ca2+ triggered by NKG2D and 2B4 synergy [37].
Because the supply of freshly isolated NK cells from patients and
healthy controls is quite limited and because in vitro expansion of
NK cells in the presence of cytokines changes their signalling
properties, we performed confocal microscopy experiments to
follow intracellular Ca2+ responses in 500 NK cells after the
receptors were co-crosslinked. Recordings of NK cells revealed
that NKG2D and 2B4 cross-linking elicited distinct responses in
cells from different sources (Figure 5). In the NK cells from healthy
controls and IA-phase patients, cross-linking induced a sharp and
sustained increase in intracellular Ca2+ (Figure 5.A, B). Notably, in
NK cells from IT-phase patients, there was no significant increase
in intracellular Ca2+ flow (Figure 5.C). The Ca2+ mobilisation
induced by NKG2D and 2B4 synergy in .100 NK cells from
representative healthy controls or patients at 200 (Figure 5.D) and
500 s (Figure 5.E) was analysed. Altogether, these results suggest
that the synergistic co-activation signalling pathway activated by
NKG2D and 2B4 may not operate properly in IT-phase patients
due to the reduction in NKG2D and 2B4 expression in NK cells.
Soluble TGF-b1 was associated with the reduction in
NKG2D and 2B4
Surface expression of NKG2D has been shown to be down￾regulated by TGF-b and IL-21 [38–40]. During chronic HCV
infection, TGF-b down-modulates the expression of NKG2D on
NK cells, leading to the impairment of their function [26].
Therefore, to verify whether there are also elevated levels of TGF￾b1 in patients with persistent HBV infection, we used a cytometric
bead array (CBA) inflammation kit and ELISA technology to
simultaneously quantify the presence of multiple cytokines in sera
from HBV patients and healthy controls. The cytokines analysed
were IL-1a, IL-1b, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, TNF,
IFN-c and TGF-b1. The peak concentrations of TGF-b1 in IT
patients were far in excess of those observed for the other ten
cytokines; this cytokine was also present at significantly higher
concentrations than those measured in healthy controls and
patients in other phases of infection (Figure 6.A). In addition, an
inverse linear relationship was observed between TGF-b1
concentration and the percentage of circulating NKG2D-express￾ing NK cells (Figure 6.B, C). An identical relationship was
identified with the proportion of 2B4-expressing NK cells
(Figure 6.D, E). These data demonstrate a correlation between
the down-regulation of activating NK receptors and high levels of
TGF-b1 and suggest a role for the influence of soluble TGF-b1 on
NK cells in IT-phase HBV patients.
Anti-TGFb1 partially restored surface expression of
NKG2D and 2B4 on NK cells
Down-modulation of expression is associated with elevated
levels of TGF-b1 and has also been observed in cancer patients
[39,41–45]. Therefore, we hypothesised that TGF-b1 might
modulate NKG2D surface expression. We investigated whether
the altered expression of activating NK cell receptors was induced
by TGF-b1. To test this possibility, we used NK cells from healthy
control peripheral blood preincubated with TGF-b1 for 3 days.
The percentage of NKG2D and 2B4 levels on NK cells, as
monitored by flow cytometry, were markedly down-regulated
(Figure 7A, B). Fresh NK cells were also cultured with sera from
healthy controls and patients in different immune states. After 3
days, the surface expression of NKG2D on NK cells preincubated
with sera from IT patients (Figure 7.C, red lines) was markedly
lower than on NK cells preincubated with sera from healthy
controls (black lines). Furthermore, anti-TGF-b1 partially restored
the expression of NKG2D on NK cells co-cultured with sera from
IT-phase patients (Figure 7.D, blue lines). In contrast, there were
no significant changes in NK cells preincubated with isotype
control Abs (green lines) (Figure 7.D). In the same cell culture
experiments, NK cells isolated from healthy controls were
stimulated with TGF-b1 or sera from various sources. The
proportion of 2B4 levels on NK cells decreased when co-cultured
with TGF-b1 or sera from IT patients (Figure 7.B, E, red lines).
Similarly, the expression levels of 2B4 recovered when the
incubation was performed in the presence of a neutralising anti￾TGF-b1 antibody (Figure 7.F, blue lines). Cumulative data shown
in Figure 7.G, H indicate that the percentage of NKG2D and 2B4
levels on NK cells decreased significantly after co-culture with sera
from IT patients, and minor reductions were observed when NK
cells were cultured with sera from IA- or IN-phase patients. The
expression of NKG2D was partially restored and 2B4 expression
recovered when NK cells were incubated with neutralising anti￾TGF-b1 antibody. There were no significant changes in NK cells
preincubated with isotype control Abs. Taken together, these data
indirectly suggest that the expression levels of NKG2D and 2B4 on
NK cells were suppressed by high levels of TGF-b1 in IT-phase
patients.
Anti-TGFb1 partially restored Ca2+ flux in NK cells from
healthy controls incubated with sera from IT patients
During chronic HCV infection, TGF-b1 down-modulates the
expression of NKG2D on NK cells, leading to the impairment of
their function [26]. Inhibition of TGF-b1 restores the ability of
NK cells from both the peripheries and livers of patients with CHB
infection to produce antiviral IFN-c [19]. Anti-TGF-b1 partially
restored NKG2D and 2B4 surface expression on NK cells from IT
patients. We then postulated that high levels of TGF-b1 might
affect the functions of NK cells in IT patients. To investigate this
hypothesis, we used in vitro experimental models. First, NK cells
obtained from healthy controls were stimulated with sera from IT
patients plus anti-TGF-b1 antibodies or isotype control Abs for
72 h to imitate a physiological state. The Ca2+ mobilisation
induced by synergism between NKG2D and 2B4 on NK cells was
then assessed. As observed in Figure 8.A, sera from IT-phase
patients abrogated the Ca2+ mobilisation potential of NK cells
from healthy controls. Additionally, anti-TGF-b1 partially re￾stored Ca2+ flux in NK cells from healthy controls that had been

NK cells incubated with sera from different patients and anti￾TGF-b1 Abs revealed distinct responses. In some patients (Pt508),
NKG2D+2B4 cross-linking induced a sharp, oscillating rise in

TGF-b1 inhibited the cell-cycle in NK cells in vitro
Interestingly, four activating NK cell molecules (NKG2D/
DAP10 and 2B4/SAP) have been found to be expressed at low
levels in IT patients, and this phenotype was associated with high
levels of TGF-b1, reminiscent of the cell-cycle arrest induced by
TGF-b1. Therefore, we next examined whether high levels of
TGF-b1 in IT patients could facilitate cell-cycle arrest in NK cells.
An important role of TGF-b1 involves restricting the growth of
neuronal, epithelial and hematopoietic cells. Key elements of this
mechanism are the expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase
inhibitors p15INK4b and p21 (also called WAF1/CIP1) [46–47].
These proteins play an important role in restraining cell-cycle
progression. Substantial evidence indicates that TGF-b1 partici￾pates in blocking the development of T-lineage acute lympho￾blastic leukaemia by suppressing T-cell proliferation [48]. It has
also been shown that the effect of TGF-b1-mediated depression of

NKG2D surface expression may only depend on the transcription
levels of NKG2D [39]. Due to the limited supply of fresh NK cells
from patients, NK cells from healthy controls were stimulated with
TGF-b1 or serum from various sources (IA, IT and IN patients) in
the presence or absence of anti-TGF-b1Ab. Strikingly, NK cells
preincubated with serum from IT patients exhibited both
significantly decelerated cell proliferation and G1 cell-cycle arrest
(Figure 9). Conversely, preincubation of NK cells with sera from
IT patients plus anti-TGF-b1Ab resulted in the restoration of cell
proliferation and a decrease in the cell population in G1 phase
(Figure 9).
p21 and p15 were elevated in IT patients and arrested
the NK cell cycle
The TGF-b-Smad signal-transduction pathway is an important
tumour growth-suppressor pathway. Binding of TGF-b to the
functional TGF-b1RII in NK cells induces the phosphorylation of
the signalling molecule Smad2 and initiates signalling in the TGF￾b-Smad pathway [46–47,49]. The cyclin-dependent kinase
inhibitors p15 and p21 play important roles in restraining cell
cycle progression [46]. To further substantiate our finding that
high levels of TGF-b1 inhibited the NK cell cycle in IT patients,
we examined the expression of Smad-2, phosphorylation of Smad2
(Smad-2P) and expression of p15 and p21 in NK cells using
western blotting. First, NK cells were stimulated for 30 min, 12 h
and 72 h with TGF-b1. As shown in Figure 10.A, TGF-b1 was
able to induce Smad-2P in NK cells from controls at 30 min and
72 h. p21 was undetectable in NK cell extracts, and p15 was able
to be induced only after a 72-h incubation with TGF-b1. Next,
NK cells were preincubated with sera from IT patients or with
hepatitis ascites with or without anti-TGF-b1Ab for 72 h. As
expected, sera and ascites were able to induce the expression of P￾Smad-2 and p15 but had no effect on the expression of p21. In
comparison, our analysis of NK cells preincubated with anti-TGF￾b1 Ab confirmed the absence of P-Smad-2 and the reduced levels
of Smad2 and p15 in the absence of TGF-b1 signalling
(Figure 10.B). We then assessed the endogenous status of Smad2,
P-Smad-2, p15 and p21 in patients. Fresh NK cells obtained from
the peripheral blood of three IT patients were analysed using
western blotting (Figure 10.C). Relatively high levels of Smad-2P,
Smad2 and p15 on NK cells were observed in IT patient samples.
In particular, the levels of p21 exhibited considerable enhance￾ment in IT patients (Figure 10.C).
Altogether, these data demonstrate that TGF-b1 signalling is
responsible for the defects in NK cell phenotypes and performance
in IT-phase patients, and the defective NK cells found in patients
facilitate persistent HBV infection.
Discussion
There are over 350 million persistent HBV carriers worldwide,
and approximately 90% of children become chronic carriers after
HBV infection [1,3]. Immune tolerance is a serious problem in
CHB carriers, who are at high risk of developing cirrhosis and
HCC later in life [4,10]. HBV persistence is thought to result from
inefficiencies of innate and adaptive immune responses. NK cells
are a major component of innate immunity. Accumulating
evidence has suggested a role for NK cells in the fight to control
persistent virus infection [15,50–52]. However, the tolerance
mechanisms of HBV persistence have not been well explored. For
the first time (to our knowledge), we demonstrated that NKG2D/
DAP10 and 2B4/SAP were down-regulated on circulating NK
cells. Consequently, these NK cells were functionally impaired in
IT-phase patients. The loss of these molecules was mediated by
TGF-b1, which resulted in cell-cycle arrest due to the induction of
p15 and p21. Our results indicated that NKG2D and 2B4
expression were decreased on circulating NK cells from IT-phase
patients but not CHB patients in other phases or healthy controls.
Furthermore, DAP10 and SAP, the intracellular adaptor proteins
of NKG2D and 2B4 in humans, were also significantly reduced in
NK cells from IT patients. It has been reported that NK cell
cytotoxicity towards target cells is tempered by a request for
combined signals from multiple activating receptors, such as
NKG2D and 2B4 [16,35–36]. To evaluate the functional
consequences of the observed reduction in the proportion of
NKG2D and 2B4, Ca2+ mobilisation triggered by the double￾activating signals was analysed. Our data revealed that the down￾regulation of Ca2+ flux was induced by synergism between
NKG2D and 2B4 in NK cells from IT patients but occurred at
normal levels in IA patients and healthy controls. In addition, NK
cell cytotoxicity and IFN-c production were decreased in IT
patients compared to healthy controls and IA patients. Anti-TGF￾b1 Abs could partially restore Ca2+ flux in NK cells from healthy
controls incubated with sera from IT patients. Moreover, anti￾TGF-b1 also restored NKG2D and 2B4 surface expression on NK
cells incubated with sera from IT patients. p21 and p15 were
elevated in IT patients and induced the arrest of the NK cell cycle.
Taken together, these results suggest that TGF-b1 reduces
NKG2D/DAP10 and 2B4/SAP expression on NK cells during
persistent HBV infection and suppresses innate antiviral immunity
by blocking the cell cycle, which would eventually provide an
additional HBV strategy to avoid NK cell-mediated recognition.
Our results suggest that NK cells may be functionally impaired
in IT patients. This conclusion is supported by at least four
important findings. First, the percentage of NKG2D and 2B4
levels was lower on NK cells from patients in the IT phase
compared to patients in other phases and healthy controls, which
indicates an activation defect in circulating NK cells. Second,
lower levels of intracellular adaptor proteins were associated with
lower surface expression levels of NKG2D and 2B4, which implies
that the signalling pathways leading to NK-cell activation might be
impeded. Specific silencing of DAP10 or SAP led to deficient NK￾cell cytotoxicity. Third, patients in the IT phase had a specific
defect in NK cell cytotoxic activity. Moreover, there was a
significant reduction in the production of IFN-c by NK cells from
patients in the IT phase compared to healthy controls and IA- and
IN-phase patients. Fourth, NKG2D and 2B4 receptor synergy
down-regulated the mobilisation of Ca2+ in primary NK cells from
IT patients. These observations indicate that NK cells are not
completely functional during the IT phase, which may contribute
to the persistence of HBV infections. In our study, IT-phase HBV
patients were characterised by lower levels of NKG2D and 2B4
10% FBS in the presence of IL-15 (10 ng/ml) and IL-2 (100 U/ml)) (black lines) and TGF-b1 (1 ng/ml) (red lines). NK cells from healthy controls were
cultured with healthy control sera (black lines), sera from IA-phase patients (blue lines) or sera from IT-phase patients (red lines) for 3 days. Surface
expression of NKG2D (C) and 2B4 (E) were assessed at 72 h using flow cytometry. Histograms showing NKG2D (C) and 2B4 (E) surface expression on
NK cells from one representative donor out of three studied are shown. Freshly isolated NK cells from healthy controls co-cultured with sera from IT￾phase patients alone (red lines) or with anti-TGF-b1 Ab (blue lines) or isotype control Ab (green lines). The expression levels of NKG2D (D) and 2B4 (F)
were analysed using FACS. The results are representative of three independent experiments. Cumulative data are shown (G, H).

compared with healthy individuals. To our knowledge, this is the
first report of reduced expression of NKG2D/DAP10 and 2B4/
SAP in IT patients, thus indicating that the function of NK cells
was impaired due to deficiencies in the double-activating signals.
In this context, abundant data in cancer patients has shown that
impaired NK function can be attributed to the down-modulation
of activating receptors, such as NKG2D, which can be inhibited
via TGF-b1 [42–44]. Notably, NKG2D-dependent NK cell
functions are also modulated during chronic HCV infection
[26]. These findings provide further evidence for our observation

that NKG2D was down-regulated during the IT phase of HBV
infection. The increased expression of 2B4 on virus-specific CD8+
T cells, both in the peripheral blood and in the liver, is believed to
mediate inhibitory signalling in the absence of SAP during CHB
infection [53], but this has not been evaluated in NK cells in the
presence of HBV infection. Interestingly, the absence of 2B4
resulted in diminished LCMV-specific CD8+ T cell responses and
prolonged viral persistence in mice persistently infected with
LCMV. Additionally, long-lasting viral persistence was regulated
by 2B4-deficient NK cells acting early in infection. These
observations illustrate the value of NK cell self-tolerance to
activated CD8+ T cells in early infection, similar to the IT phase of
HBV infection; these results also demonstrate how NK cells can
regulate a persistent infection that appears to be dependent on T
cell responses [54]. We also analysed the frequency of NKp30,
NKp44, NKp46, CD16, CD27 and CD226 expression in
circulating NK cells from healthy controls and CHB patients.
We observed that the frequency of NKp30 was slightly decreased
in patients in the IT phase relative to the healthy controls. No
statistical differences existed on other receptors between patients
and healthy controls. It has been previously shown that TGF-b1
can down-regulate NKp30 and NKG2D in vitro, suggesting that
slightly decrease of NKp30 in IT-phase patients may related to the
high levels of TGF-b1 [39]. Evidence from previous studies
suggested that SAP deficiency could lead to the inhibition of NK
cytotoxicity in humans [28,55–56]. It has also been shown that in
the absence of SAP, lymphoma development would normally be
eliminated by apoptosis in patients with X-linked lymphoprolifer￾ative disease [57]. However, the analysis of potential apoptosis
caused by reducing expression of SAP indicated that the deficiency
of SAP would not lead to the significant apoptosis of NK92 cells
(Data not show). Here, we show that the expression of SAP is
deficient in NK cells from patients in the IT phase, suggesting that
2B4 receptors may become inhibitory, rather than activating,
during the IT phase of HBV infection due to the absence of SAP.
2B4 molecules with inhibitory functions are responsible for the
inability of NK cells to kill virus-infected cells. This feature may
further compromise NK cell function in IT patients in the absence
of SAP, which implies a positive regulatory role for SAP during
NK cell activation. Furthermore, TGF-b down-modulates
NKG2D expression on NK cells, leading to the impairment of
their cytolytic activity and ability to produce IFN-c during HCV
infection [26]. Therefore, we suggest that there may be a
functional impairment in NK cells in patients in the IT phase of
HBV infection.
T and B cells each possess a single antigen receptor, which
regulates their development and activation. Signals initiated
through antigen receptors need co-stimulatory molecules to
augment the signals. In contrast, NK cells do not possess one
dominant receptor but instead depend on synergistic co-activation
by NK cell receptors to initiate effector functions. In our studies,
we have observed that Ca2+ mobilisation cannot be induced by
NKG2D and 2B4 synergy in NK cells from IT patients, providing
an explanation for the dominance of the double-activating signals
in controlling NK cell activation. Strikingly, the deficiencies of the
double-activating signals may be significant with respect to NK￾cell tolerance. TGF-b1 inhibits NK cell activity and cytotoxicity by
down-regulating NKG2D, as originally proposed in various cancer
fields [42–44]. It has also been observed that TGF-b can impair
NK cell cytolytic activity and IFN-c production during HCV
infection [26]. However, the role of TGF-b1 in blocking NK-cell
function during the IT phase of HBV infection has not yet been

well defined. Our data demonstrate that TGF-b1 can down￾regulate NKG2D and 2B4 surface expression and restrain the
Ca2+ mobilisation triggered by NKG2D and 2B4 receptor
synergy. Moreover, anti-TGF-b1 Abs can restore NKG2D and
2B4 expression and also partially restore Ca2+ flux. HCV infection
can induce TGF-b1, which can regulate HCV RNA replication
[58]. HCV-specific Th17 cells are suppressed by virus-induced
TGF-b [59–60]. Furthermore, the HBV X protein significantly
up-regulates the expression of TGF-b1 and TGF-bRII in the LX￾2 human hepatic stellate cell line [61]. The HBV-encoded pX
oncoprotein amplifies TGF-b signalling [62], and HBV X antigen
promotes TGF-b1 activity [63]. These findings suggest that during
the IT phase of HBV infection, there may be a similar mechanism
by which the virus evades host-protective immune responses.
NK cell function can be regulated by TGF-b [49] and by CD4+
CD25+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) through a TGF-b-dependent
mechanism in both humans and mice [64–65]. We surmised that
in IT patients, Treg cells might be the source of high levels of
TGF-b. In a similar mechanism, Treg cells expressing membrane￾bound TGF-b directly down-regulated the expression of
NKG2D/2B4 on NK cell surfaces and inhibited NK cell effector
functions [64]. Previous studies have reported that cancer￾expanded myeloid-derived suppressor cells can directly contact
NK cells and induce anergy via membrane-bound TGF-b1 [66],
though other studies have found that Treg cells are the main
negative regulators of NK cell function in tumours [64]. In our
study, anti-TGF-b1 did not completely restore Ca2+ flux and cell￾cycle arrest, suggesting that some other inhibitory molecules such
as IL-10, which is also produced by regulatory CD8+ T cells [67],
may also play a role in NK impairment during the IT phase of
chronic HBV infection. Moreover, recent studies have shown that
the partial functional tolerance induced in NK cells by the

immunosuppressive cytokine environment in CHB can be
corrected in vitro by the specific blockage of IL-10 and TGF-b
[19]. These findings support our results for IT phase patients and
suggest that regulatory CD8+ T cells may also influence NK cells
in IT-phase patients by producing IL-10. Furthermore, our results
demonstrate that the level of IL-10 in IT-phase serum was higher
than in sera from healthy controls and IN-phase patients but lower
than in sera from IA-phase patients. However, the levels of IL-10
in the sera were significantly lower than the levels of TGF-b1,
which suggests that TGF-b1 was the predominant suppressive
factor in IT-phase patients.
Our results suggest that the in vivo administration of nucleoside
analogues partially overcomes the defect in NK cell function in
patients. In addition, we observed that NK cell function was
significantly lower at the onset of inflammation in IT patients,
suggesting that some other inhibitory factors may restrain NK cell
function during the initial phase of liver inflammation. Some studies
have found that reduced IFN-c production by NK cells in HBV
infection independent of the IT phase [32], we believe this is due to
different methods of classifying patient groups. Another interesting
finding of our study was the observation that p21 and p15 were
obviously elevated on NK cells from IT patients. The cyclin￾dependent kinase inhibitors p15 and p21Waf1/Cip1 acted as
inhibitors of cell-cycle progression [46]. Relatively high levels of
Smad-2P and Smad2 were observed in NK cells from IT-phase
patients, implying that TGF-b1 had the potential to arrest the NK
cell cycle. High rates of p15 methylation in HCCs have been shown
to be associated with HCV infection. TGF-b-dependent inhibition
of HCV replicons was also associated with cell-cycle arrest in a
Smad-dependent manner [68]. Furthermore, the expression of p21
during liver cirrhosis is related to the persistence of infection with
HBV [69], which suggests that p21 plays an important role in the
progression of HBV. However, one study has shown that the HBV
X protein overcomes cellular senescence by down-regulating levels
of p16 and p21 via DNA methylation [70]. In that study, HepG2
cells were used, which may explain why their findings differed from
our own. Some previous studies reporting persistent HBV infection
have focused on genetic variants [71–74]. Unfortunately, this study
was limited by the supply of freshly isolated NK cells from patients
and healthy controls, and therefore, our analysis was restricted to
the circulating compartment only. A more detailed investigation of
the frequency and function of intrahepatic NK cells in IT patients
should be performed.
In summary, our findings demonstrate that high levels of TGF￾b1 are associated with reduced NKG2D and 2B4 expression, the
functional impairment of NK cell function, and consequently, with
the development of persistent HBV. Our study provides a basis for
improving current therapies for IT patients by blocking TGF-b1
inhibitory pathways, which could result in additive efficacy at
eliminating the virus during the initial phase of CHB infection.
Materials and Methods
Ethics statement
Peripheral blood samples and clinical assessments were obtained
during routine hepatitis follow-ups. In accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki and the Ethical Board of the Institutional
Review Board of the University of Science and Technology of
China, all participants provided written informed consent, which
was obtained before enrolment in the study.
Patients, healthy subjects and treatments
Peripheral blood samples were obtained from the Department
of Infectious Diseases of the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui
Medical University. The patient characteristics are listed in
Table 1. There were no significant differences in demographic
variables (gender/age) between the patient and the healthy control
groups (Table 1). Blood samples were processed within 4 h of
collection. Among the 249 clinical samples, 65 were diagnosed as
IT phase, 48 were diagnosed as IA phase, and 41 were diagnosed
as IN phase. The diagnostic criteria for the clinical terms of HBV
infection were adopted from the National Institutes of Health
(NIH) conferences on the management of hepatitis B in 2000 and
2006 [4,10]. Detailed characteristics of the patients are shown in
Table S1. Peripheral blood samples obtained from 95 healthy
donors at Hefei Blood Bank and Anhui Provincial Hospital served
as controls. All patients were negative for anti-hepatitis C and anti￾human immunodeficiency virus antibodies and were treatment
naı¨ve. All patients were treated with anti-viral therapy consisting of
nucleoside analogues (lamivudine, adefovir dipivoxil, and enteca￾vir) without immunomodulators.
Flow cytometric analysis
Fresh human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)
were isolated from peripheral blood by Ficoll-Isopaque (Solarbio,
China) gradient centrifugation. NK cells were freshly purified from
PBMCs by negative selection using magnetic microbead separa￾tion kits (Miltenyi Biotec), resulting in .90% purity. Human
PBMCs and NK cells were prepared and stained with monoclonal
antibodies (mAbs). Fc receptors (FcRs) were blocked using normal
mouse serum or rat serum. Abs against the following proteins were
used for staining human PBMCs: CD3 (SK7), CD56 (B159),
CD16 (3G8), CD27 (M-T271), CD226 (DX11), NKp30 (p30-15),
NKp44 (p44-8.1), NKp46 (9E2/NKP46), NKG2D (1D11) (BD
PharMingen) and 2B4 (eBioC1.7) (eBioscience). For intracellular
cytokine assays, PBMCs were fixed in 2% formaldehyde after
surface protein staining. After washing, PBMCs were permeabi￾lised with 0.5% saponin, and the cells were then incubated with
FITC–anti-IFN-c (BD PharMingen) or PE–anti-T-bet
(eBioscience). For CD107a analysis, PBMCs were cultured with
IL-12 (10 ng/ml, R&D systems) and phycoerythrin-conjugated
anti-CD107a (BD Bioscience) for 16 hr. Then, the cells were
washed, blocked and stained with surface antibodies for ordinary
FACS staining. For direct immunofluorescence staining of human

whole blood, the appropriate volume of fluorochrome-conjugated
monoclonal antibody was added to 100 mL of whole blood, which
was then incubated in the dark at room temperature (20u to 25uC)
for 30 min. Next, 2 mL of 16 RBC Lysis Buffer (Biolegend) was
added, and the solutions were incubated for 10 min in the dark at
room temperature. They were then centrifuged at 5006 g for
5 min, and the supernatants were removed. After washing once,
0.5 mL of 1% paraformaldehyde was added to the solution, which
was mixed thoroughly. The solutions were stored at 2 to 8uC until
analysis. Appropriate isotype controls were used in all experiments
to estimate background fluorescence. Stained cells were analysed
using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson), and the
data were analysed using FlowJo analysis software 7.6.1 (Treestar).
For the cell-cycle analysis, cells were seeded in 12- or 24-well plates
at 60 to 70% confluency. After a 72-h incubation with patient
serum, NK cells were harvested, washed in PBS and fixed
overnight in 70% ethanol. The next day, the cells were collected,
washed in PBS, incubated at 37uC for 10 min with PBS containing
100 mg/mL RNase A and 25 mg/mL propidium iodide (PI)
(Sigma-Aldrich) and analysed using flow cytometry (BD Biosci￾ences, San Jose, CA, USA). Data analysis was performed using
ModFit LT software for Win32 3.1 (Verity Software House, PO
Box 247, Topsham, ME 04086, USA).
In vitro cell culture, stimulation and transfection
NK cell populations were enriched from whole blood by negative
selection using an NK Cell Isolation Kit (Miltenyi Biotec). A total of
16106 human NK cells were cultured in 24-well plates at 37uC in a
5% CO2 incubator. The cells were incubated in medium alone or
with TGF-b1 (1 ng/ml; R&D systems) and then with IL-15 (10 ng/
ml; PeproTech) plus IL-2 (100 U/ml) for 72 h. In another culture
model, NK cells were cultured in the presence of 20% healthy
control serum, IT patient serum or IA/IN patient serum with or
without anti-TGF-b-neutralising Ab (10 mg/ml; R&D systems) for
72 h. For the detection of T-bet expression, PBMCs were cultured
in the presence of IFN-c (10 ng/ml, R&D systems) and IL-12
(5 ng/ml, R&D systems) for 0, 12, or 72 h. For intracellular IFN-c
detection, PBMCs were cultured with RPMI 1640 supplemented
with 10% FBS in the presence of IL-12 (10 ng/ml, R&D systems)
for 12 h. And then monensin (10 mg/ml, Sigma) was added to
prevent the secretion of the induced cytokines for 4 h. Transfection
of NK92 cells was performed using an Amaxa Cell Line
Nucleofector Kit R VCA-1001(Lonza Swiss). The transfection
procedure was performed according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Unless otherwise indicated, cells were transfected with
200 nM siRNAs. siRNA duplex homologous in sequence to HCST￾119,214,356 and SH2D1A-459,501,674, as well as scrambled
negative control constructs, were synthesised and purified by
Shanghai Gene-Pharma Co. (Shanghai, China). The primers been
used are as follows: HCST-homo-119: (59- UCC AUG UGG GUC
ACA UCC UTT AGG AUG UGA CCC AGA UGG ATT-39);
HCST-homo-214: (59- GGC ACU UCA GGC UCU UGU UTT
AAC AAG AGC CUG AAG UGC CTT-39); HCST-homo-356:
(59- GGC AAA GUC UAC AUC AAC ATT UGU UGA UGU
AGA CUU UGC CTT-39); SH2D1A-homo-459: (59- AGG CGU

SH2D1A-homo-674: (59- GUC CUC AGC UAG AAG UAC ATT
UGU ACU UCU AGC UGA GGA CTT-39).
Determination of serum cytokine concentrations
Serum cytokine concentrations were analysed using a CBA
Inflammation Kit (BD Biosciences) according to the manufactur￾er’s protocols. In brief, 50 ml of patient serum or a standard
recombinant protein dilution was added to a mixture of capture
beads coated with mAb to a group of cytokines (IL-1a, IL-1b, IL￾2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, TNF and IFN-c) and a PE￾conjugated detection reagent. After 3 h, the capture beads were
washed and acquired by a flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San
Jose, CA, USA). Using the recombinant standards and FlowJo
analysis software 7.6.1 (Treestar), cytokine concentrations were
quantified for each serum sample. Serum TGF-b1 was assayed
using a standard sandwich ELISA Kit (CSB-E04725h) (Cusabio),
in which 80 ml of patient serum was analysed according to the
manufacturer’s high sensitivity protocol. To activate latent TGF￾b1 to the immuno-reactive form, serum was incubated with 1N
HCL for 10 min at room temperature.
Analysis of mRNA expression by real-time quantitative
RT-PCR
Total RNA was prepared from NK cells from healthy controls
and HBV patients using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen, CA)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cellular RNA was
used for cDNA synthesis. Semi-quantitative real-time RT-PCR was
performed using a SYBR Premix Ex Taq Perfect Real Time Kit
(TaKaRa) and a sequence detector (Rotor Gene 3000, Corbett
Research). The oligonucleotide primers used to amplify DAP10
were DAP10-F (59-GGC TGC AGC TCA GAC GAC-39) and
DAP10-R (59- AGG AGC GGC AGA GAG AGG-39). The primers
used to amplify SAP were SAP-F (59-GAC GCA GTG GCT GTG
TAT-39) and SAP-R (59-TCA TGG GGC TTT CAT TTC AGG
CAG ACA TCA GG-39). The primers used to amplify EAT-2 were
EAT-2-F (59-AGA CAG CGA GTC GAT ACC AG-39) and EAT￾2-R (59-CCG TGT TTC TCT CTG AAG ATT CG-39). A
negative control without cDNA template was performed with every
assay. The transcript copy number per subject was calculated by
normalisation to GAPDH expression.
Immunofluorescence analysis
Primary NK cells (56104 cells) were allowed to adhere to poly-L￾lysine-coated slides before fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde for
20 min. Slides were then washed with TBST buffer (10 mM Tris￾HCl, 0.1% Tween-20, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5) three times for 5 min
each and permeabilised with 0.5% saponin (Sigma-Aldrich). After
blocking with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in TBS for 1 h, the
slides were then washed three times in TBST for 5 min and
incubated with a primary antibody (anti-DAP10 (FL-93) sc-25623;
anti-SAP (C-18) sc-8639, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) diluted 1:100
for 1 h. Afterwards, the slides were washed three times again in
TBST for 5 min, incubated for 30 min with the secondary antibody
(donkey anti-goat IgG-FITC, sc-2024 or goat anti-rabbit IgG-FITC,
sc-2012, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at a dilution of 1:1,000 and
stained with DAPI (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 min. A final
wash in PBS was performed, and the slides were then mounted on
coverslips in VECTASHIELD (Vector Laboratories) anti-fade
solution. All procedures were performed at room temperature.
Images were acquired on a Zeiss 510 Meta multi-photon confocal
microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Analysis was performed
using LSM510 META software (Zeiss) and a JD801 Morphological
Image Analysis System (JSJD Tech Inc., China). The analysis was
performed on five confocal images from 200 cells per experiment in
images using channels that showed the co-stained proteins of interest.
Ca2+ flux analysis
NK cells were resuspended (16106 cells/mL) in culture medium
containing 0.2 M Fluo-4 AM (Invitrogen, USA) and 1 M Fura Red

AM (Invitrogen, USA) and incubated at 37uC for 30 min. The
cells were then washed once with HBSS supplemented with 1%
FBS and resuspended at 16106 cells/mL in 0.5 mL HBSS plus
1% FBS. They were then added to poly-L-lysine-coated (Sigma)
wells attached to Lab-Tek II chambered coverslips (Thermo Fisher
Scientific Inc.). The NK cells were allowed to settle onto the
coverslips at 37uC for 15 min. Then, the medium was replaced
with 300 mL cold HBSS plus 1% FBS containing 3 g each of the
mAbs specific for NK receptors. The cells were incubated on ice
for 30 min. The cells were then washed once in 1 mL HBSS plus
1% FBS, and 300 mL cold HBSS with 1% FBS was placed into
each chamber. The chamber was warmed in a 37uC, 5% CO2
incubator for 5 min. Data were captured on a Zeiss LSM510
confocal microscope using a 206 objective (Zeiss, Oberkochen,
Germany). The microscope was set to scan mode to acquire
wavelengths from 499 to 670 nm in a single pass, and the scan
speed was set to ensure that one scan was completed every 4 s.
Sixty seconds after the beginning of the acquisition process,
secondary cross-linking goat anti-mouse F(ab’)2 antibody (Jackson
Immuno Research, West Grove, PA) was added at a final
concentration of 13 mg/mL. Scanning continued for 10 min. The
data were analysed by linear unmixing, using control spectra
acquired from cells loaded with either Fluo-4 or Fura-Red. After
unmixing, the cells were processed to yield ratios of Fluo-4
fluorescence to Fura Red fluorescence for the entire time series.
Cytotoxicity assay
The cytotoxicity of primary NK cells or NK92 cells against target
cells was measured using a standard 4-h 51Cr release assay, as
previously described [75]. Primary NK cells or NK92 cells were used
as effector cells. 51Cr-labelled K562 cells (an NK cell–sensitive
erythroleukaemia cell line) were used as target cells at effector-to￾target cell (E:T) ratios of 20:1, 10:1, and 5:1. Target cells (16106
)
were labelled with 200 mCi sodium [51Cr] chromate (PerkinElmer)
for 1 h at 37uC and then washed 3–4 times with PBS. Individual
assays were performed in triplicate with 16104 target cells in 96-well
V-bottom plates. Maximum 51Cr release was determined by
incubating target cells with 2% Triton X-100. For spontaneous
51Cr release, the targets were incubated without effector cells in assay
medium alone. All samples were assayed in triplicate. Plates were
briefly spun down and incubated at 37uC for 4 h. After 4 h, the cells
were pelleted, and 100 ml of supernatant was counted by a gamma
counter. The percentage of specific 51Cr release was calculated using
the formula ([experimental release-spontaneous release]/[maximum
release-spontaneous release])6100%. Spontaneous release did not
exceed 10% of the maximum release in all experiments.
Western blotting
After NK cell purification using MACS (magnetic-activated cell
sorting), NK cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE under non￾reducing conditions on a 12% polyacrylamide gel. After electro￾phoresis, the proteins were transferred onto PVDF membranes
(Millipore) by electroblotting using vertical buffer tanks. The
membranes were blocked with blocking buffer (5% non-fat dry
milk in wash buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.9% NaCl, and
0.1% Tween 20)) overnight at 4uC and then incubated with the
primary antibodies (at the recommended dilutions) for 1.5 h at
room temperature. The membranes were then washed with wash
buffer six times and incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary
antibodies for 1 h. After washing six times with wash buffer, protein
bands were visualised using an enhanced chemiluminescent system
(Pierce). The primary antibodies used [(Smad2 (D43B4), Phospho￾Smad2 (Ser465/476), p15INK4B and p21Waf1/Cip1 (DCS60)] were all
obtained from Cell Signaling Technology.
Statistical analysis
The data are expressed as the mean 6 SEM. One-way
ANOVA was used to compare the differences among three or
more groups, followed by the Bonferroni post hoc test. The analysis
was completed using SPSS for Windows (version 10.1; SPSS). In
all analyses, P-values,0.05 were considered statistically signifi￾cant.
