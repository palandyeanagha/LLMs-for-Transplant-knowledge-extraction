Gastric acid secretion and gastrin production in the
short bowel'syndrome
N S WILLIAMS, P EVANS, AND R F G J KING
From the University Department of Surgery, The General Infirmary, Leeds
SUMMARY Excess gastric acid secretion and gastrin production may occur in patients with the
short bowel syndrome but the two measurements have never been made simultaneously in man in
response to a food stimulus. Using the technique of intragastric titration, this was carried out in
eight patients after extensive small bowel resection resulting mainly from vascular occlusion and
in eight matched normal control subjects. Basal acid output and peak acid output in response to
pentagastrin was also measured separately. Although peak and integrated serum gastrin
concentrations were significantly greater in patients (450±SE 109 pg/ml; 113±2*9x 10-3
pg/ml/min) compared with control subjects (174±98 pg/ml; 6 1 +2*Ox 10-3 pg/ml/min p<005), no
concomitant increase in acid secretion was shown either during intragastric titration or in
response to pentagastrin. These findings indicate that there is no rationale for treating these
patients with long term anti-ulcer therapy.
Excessive secretion of gastric acid has been shown
after extensive small bowel resection in both man
and experimental animals.14 This abnormality is
considered to play an important role in the short
bowel syndrome because it impairs intraluminal
digestion. The low pH inactivates lipase, precipi￾tates bile salts and damages small bowel mucosa.5
The effects of acid hypersecretion are considered to
be so deleterious that in the past some surgeons
recommended that vagotomy should be carried out
simultaneously with the intestinal resection.6 7 With
the advent of H2 receptor antagonists a more
conservative approach is now suggested.8
The acid hypersecretion is usually explained on
the basis of raised concentrations of serum gastriil
which have been found by some investigators.9_
This explanation can only remain a supposition,
however, as these two measurements have never
been made simultaneously in man in response to a
meal stimulus.
The present study has used the method of
intragastric titrationlz to achieve this aim. In addi￾tion the opportunity was taken to confirm a previous
report4 which showed in man that acid hypersecre￾tion occurred in response to pentagastrin.

bowel resection were compared with a group of
normal control subjects. In view of the possible
influence that residual Crohn's disease in the small
bowel might have on gastric secretion, most of the
patients studied had undergone resection as a result
of vascular occlusion.
Methods
PATIENT AND CONTROL SUBJECTS
Informed consent was obtained from all subjects.
Eight patients (four men and four women) were
studied and compared with eight normal subjects
(four men and four women) without gastrointestinal
disease, matched carefully for age (patients 60±SE
4.5 years; normal subjects 63±4 years) and body
weight (patients 62±3*0 kg; normal subjects 64±4*6
kg). Each patient had undergone extensive resection
of the distal small bowel, a mean of 5 3 years (range
1-16 years) previously. The reason for excision was
vascular occlusion either because of thrombus or
embolus (five patients), strangulation within an
incisional hernia (one patient) or pressure from a
mesenteric cyst (one patient). One patient who was
considered to have ischaemic bowel at operation,
has since been shown to have Crohn's disease. The
mean length of bowel resected was 2*3 metres
(range 1*4-3*8 m) as measured at operation and 1.6
metres (range 1-0±3-0 m) as measured from the
pathological specimen. Most patients had been

Gastric acid secretion and gastrin production in the short bowel syndrome
maintained on total parenteral nutrition for a
variable period after operation although this had
ceased at the time of the study. Each patient did,
however, complain of chronic diarrhoea.
INTRAGASTRIC TITRATION STUDY
After an overnight fast, a double lumen nasogastric
tube was passed into the stomach and its position
verified by the water recovery test. Basal gastric
secretion was aspirated by continuous suction at
7-12 mm Hg negative pressure with a vacuum
pump. Residual juice was collected for 15 minutes
and discarded, basal secretion was then collected for
four 15 minute periods. Basal acid concentration
was determined by titration of 0.2 ml of juice with
0.2 N NaOH to pH 7-0.
A liquid test meal was prepared'2 by dissolving
four standard red Oxo cubes (Brooke Bond Group
plc) in 400 ml of water at 370 giving a 6 25% wv
solution. The pH was adjusted to 5.5 by addition of
0-2 N NaOH if required. Validation experiments
showed that the osmolarity of the meal and the
concentration of its constituents were reproduci￾ble. The coefficients of variation in the content of
sodium, fat and nitrogen after solution, were 2 3%,
7 8% and 4.3% respectively.
Each meal was instilled into the stomach through
one limb of the nasogastric tube by gravity over two
minutes. After each meal, gastric acid secretion was
measured for 60 minutes by the technique of intra￾gastric titration13 as modified by Lam et ai14 (Fig. 1).
Briefly this involved continually mixing the gastric
contents by removing and reinstilling 30 ml aliquots
seven times per minute with an automatic syringe.
The gastric contents were passed over a combined
pH and reference electrode and intragastric pH was
maintained at 5-5 with an automatic titrator which
instilled 0 5 mol/l NaOH from an automatic burette
through the other limb of the nasogastric tube. The
number of mmol of HC1 secreted was assumed to be
equal to the number of mmol of NaOH necessary to
maintain intragastric pH at 5 5.
After 60 minutes gastric contents were completely
aspirated and the residual volume measured. Six
millilitre samples of blood were taken from an
antecubital vein at 0, 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, and 60
minutes. Each specimen was allowed to clot in a
glass tube for one to two hours at room tempera￾ture. The clots were rimmed, the tube centrifuged
and an aliquot of serum was stored at -200C for
subsequent assay. The procedure used was that
described by Stadil et al and under these condi￾tions no alteration in gastrin content occurs because
of either temperature or protease activity before
separation and storage.16 Serum gastrin was mea￾sured by radio immunoassay using the unique high

titre antiserum (AB4362) found by Rehfeld.17 This
antibody has a high specificity for both the G17 and
G34 forms of gastrin.
ASPIRATION STUDY
On a separate day basal acid output (BAO) was
measured as previously described and in addition
pentagastrin acid output (PAO) in response to 6
ug/kg of pentagastrin administered subcutaneously
was determined.18
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Differences in serum gastrin concentration and acid
output between the two groups were analysed by the
Wilcoxon's sum of ranks test for unpaired data.
Correlation between measurements were analysed
by Spearman's rank correlation.'9 All results were
expressed as mean±SE.

Discussion
It is generally believed that after extensive resection
of the small intestine in man there is an increase in
the amount of gastric acid secreted. The abnormal￾ity has been explained by the finding that serum
gastrin is raised in these patients. The results of our
study although confirming the rise in serum gastrin

Gastric acid secretion and gastrin production in the short bowel syndrome
previously observed have been unable to show that
this is associated with a concomitant increase in acid
secretion.
The evidence for increased acid production has
primarily been derived from animal experi￾ments.1 20-22 Although several case reports docu￾ment acid hypersecretion after extensive small
bowel resection in man few studies have measured
acid production in a controlled manner. Thus, Aber
et a!2 carefully documented gastric secretion, urinary
net hydrogen ion excretion and extracellular acid
base state in one patient and concluded that acid
hypersecretion resulted from resection. Similar con￾clusions were drawn by Krone et a!23 who found that
the pH of jejunal contents in six patients after
intestinal resection was low. Fielding et aP in a more
detailed study showed that BAO and PAO in
response to pentagastrin were significantly increased
in eight male patients who had had 60 cm or more of
their distal ileum resected for Crohn's disease
compared with four patients who had an intact
gastrointestinal tract. It is not stated if the two
groups were similar with respect to age, sex, or body
weight, factors which are of great importance in the
interpretation of data from acid secretion studies.24
Our results are at variance from those reported by
Fielding et a4 in so far as no significant difference in
BAO and PAO could be shown between our two
groups of subjects. Differences in study design
might explain this discrepancy. First, our patients
and control subjects were very carefully matched
not only for age and sex but also for body weight. In
addition seven of our eight patients did not have
Crohn's disease and if the one exception is excluded
the conclusions remain unchanged. In studies which
include patients with Crohn's disease it is not
possible to be sure if observed differences between
groups are because of resection of small bowel or
because of the presence of residual disease. It
should be noted, however, that although acid
studies do not seem to have been undertaken in
patients with Crohn's disease, several studies have
shown normal fasting and postprandial concentra￾tions of gastrin.25 26
Although several canine studies3 27-29 have ex￾amined acid output in response to a meal stimulus
after small bowel resection, similar studies have not
previously been done in man. Using the technique
of intragastric titration we were able to do this, but
as with measurements of PAO and BAO, we were
unable to confirm those animal studies which
showed hypersecretion. Although the method used
did not utilise a solid meal, the meal stimulus did
contain a balanced proportion of nutrients which are
known to stimulate acid production by similar
mechanisms.30 The technique of intragastric titra￾tion can naturally be criticised as it manipulates
intragastric pH and maintains it at a constant level.
Nevertheless, it is more 'physiological' than aspira￾tion techniques because not only can it measure acid
secretion in response to food but it is not affected by
changes in gastric emptying.31 The latter is of
particular relevance in patients after ileal resection
as recent studies suggest that the distal small bowel
may control emptying by an inhibitory feedback
mechanism.32 33 It is of interest that in a recent
canine study which used a similar method of
intragastric titration to measure acid secretion in
response to liver extract, massive small bowel
resection caused gastric acid hyposecretion. In
addition the same study showed that pentagastrin
stimulated acid secretion remained unchanged after
resection.
Since some reports22 27 28 34 35 have shown that
proximal resection was more likely to increase acid
output than distal resection it might be considered
that any discrepancy between our results and those
of others was related to this factor. Most of our
patients, however, had considerable lengths of small
bowel removed and although the distal ileum had
always been resected a significant proportion of
jejunum had also been excised. With regard to the
length and site of resection, therefore, our patients
were similar to experimental animals that showed
hypersecretion.36 21 Furthermore, in Fielding's
study in man,4 hypersecretion occurred after 60 cm
or more of distal small bowel had been resected.
Allied to this point are the findings of Windsor et a!3
who could not correlate the extent of resection with
the hypersecretion which occurred in their patients.
The finding of increased concentrations of serum
gastrin are in agreement with other studies.9 11 The
cause is obscure. The fact that the concentration of
gastrin is greater in arterial blood than in mesenteric
veins draining the distal small bowel37 suggests that
the small bowel may be necessary for the metabol￾ism of gastrin and that raised gastrin concentrations
may be secondary to impaired degradation in this
part of the gut. This hypothesis, however, seems
unlikely. If there was a decreased degradation rate
of gastrin in the patients there would be a prolonged
delay involving the peak gastrin concentration and
in its return towards basal levels. Yet the peak
gastrin concentrations were achieved at the same
time as in the control group and the subsequent fall
off appeared similar in the two groups. Similar
findings were noted by Strauss et at9 who, in fact,
postulated that the cause for the hypergastrinaemia
in their four patients might be because of the
absence of an inhibitor in the small intestine. The
likely candidates were considered at that time to be
secretin, gastrointestinal inhibitory polypeptide and

cholecystokinin (CCK). As the former two hor￾mones have been shown to be localised rimarily in
the duodenum and proximal jejunum it seems
unlikely that they are implicated. On the other hand
CCK has recently been shown to be present
throughout the small bowel39 40 and this hormone
may be culpable. Similarly, somatostatin, another
inhibitor of gastrin41 which is found throughout the
ileum may also be involved.32
Whatever the cause of the raised concentrations
of gastrin it is clear that in our patients they were not
associated with acid hypersecretion. On the face of
it this conclusion is further emphasised by the
finding that whereas in normal subjects a positive
correlation between serum gastrin and acid output
existed this was not the case in the patients.
Because, however, the correlation between these
measurements in normal subjects was dependent on
the one 'outlier' we are reluctant to draw firm
conclusions from these data. The finding that acid
secretion in resonse to exogenous pentagastrin was
no different in patients and controls suggests that
the fault is not an insensitivity of the parietal cell
mass to endogenous gastrin. It may be that either an
inhibitory substance to endogenous gastrin is pre￾sent after resection or that the gastrin that is
released is ineffective. The assay we used measured
both G17 and G34. Because G17 is mol for mol six
times more potent in stimulating acid secretion than
G34,42 a rise in the latter of the magnitude found in
our patients without a concomitant rise in G17 would
be unlikely to significantly affect acid secretion. This
explanation would of course be dependent on the
half lives of the two gastrins being identical in the
resected group and the control group. This situation
has been found to be the case in patients with
chronic renal failure.43
It is difficult to understand the purpose of the
raised serum gastrin in these patients. It was
considered at one time that because gastrin was
trophic to gastrointestinal mucosa, 45 it might play
a role in the conpensatory changes which occur in
the residual small bowel.46 47 Current evidence,
however, suggests that gastrin does not fulfil either
a physiological or pathophysiological role in the
medication of these changes.
From a clinical standpoint our findings are clear.
Although no comment can be made about changes
in the short term after extensive small bowel
resection, in the long term acid hypersecretion does
not occur. This finding also receives support from
the fact that there is no clinical evidence which
suggests an increased incidence of peptic ulceration
in these patients. It therefore seems unnecessary to
keep patients who have undergone this type of
surgery on maintenance anti-ulcer therapy.
