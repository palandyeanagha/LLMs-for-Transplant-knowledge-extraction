Shahrzad M Lari1*, Francois Gonin2 and Arlette Colchen2
Abstract
Background: Airway complications following lung transplantation remain a significant cause of morbidity and
mortality. The management of bronchial complications in Bronchus Intermedius (BI) is challenging due to the
location of right upper bronchus. The aim of this study was to analyze the results of BI Montgomery T-tube stent
in a consecutive patients with lung transplantations.
Methods: Between January 2007 and December 2010, 132 lung transplantations were performed at Foch Hospital,
Suresnes, France. All the patients who had BI Montgomery T-tube after lung transplantation were included in this
retrospective study. The demographic and interventional data and also complications were recorded.
Results: Out of 132 lung transplant recipients, 12 patients (9 male and 3 female) were entered into this study. The
indications for lung transplantation were: cystic fibrosis 8 (67%), emphysema 3 (25%), and idiopathic pulmonary
fibrosis 1 (8%). Most of the patients (83%) had bilateral lung transplantation. The mean interval between lung
transplantation and interventional bronchoscopy was 11.5 ± 9.8 (SD) months. There was bronchial stenosis at the
level of BI in 7 patients (58.3%). The Montgomery T-tube number 10 was used in 9 patients (75%). There was
statistically significant difference in Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV1) before and after stent
placement (p = 0.01). The most common complication after stent placement was migration (33%).
Conclusion: BI complications after lung transplantation are still a significant problem. Stenosis or malacia following
lung transplantation could be well managed with modified Montgomery T-tube.
Background
Airway complications are still a potential cause of mor￾bidity and mortality after lung transplantation even with
the considerable improvements in anastomotic techni￾ques and immunosuppressive drugs [1,2]. The reported
incidence of airway complications is about 7 to 18%
with a mortality rate of 2 to 4% [3].
Since systemic arterial blood flow is not preserved dur￾ing engraftment, lung transplantation is completely differ￾ent from other transplantations [4]. Revascularization of
the bronchial arterial flow may take up to 4 weeks [3,5].
Thus the viability of donor’s bronchus is completely
dependent to the retrograde collaterals from low pressure
pulmonary circulation [3,6]. During this period, the
anastomotic site is prone to ischemia and may develop
varying degrees of necrosis and dehiscence [7]. Therefore
airway complications have been mainly attributed to ische￾mia of donor bronchus during the immediate post trans￾plant period [3,8]. Other attributing factors like primary
graft dysfunction [9], pre and post pulmonary infection
[3,10], rejection [4], intense immunosupression [4], and
prolonged mechanical ventilation [11] are associated with
increased risk of anastomotic airway complications.
The clinical presentation of airway complications var￾ies from focal infection, necrosis, dehiscence, and granu￾lation tissue formation to stenosis and malacia [7].
The Bronchus Intermedius (BI) is especially prone to
ischemia after lung transplantation [7]. Different therapeu￾tic modalities, like endobronchial dilatation, laser, cryosur￾gery, and endobronchial stents, are used for the treatment
of BI stenosis depending on the severity of stenosis. The
main problem with stent placement in BI is the possible

obstruction of right upper lobe orifice [7] or restenosis at
the upper part of the stent. In Foch Hospital, the modified
Montgomery T-tube (Novatech, France) as shown in
Figure 1 was applied as stent for BI stenosis or malacia. In
this technique, after measuring, cutting, and manual
smoothening the distal ends, the tracheotomy arm of the
T tube is placed in the upper lobe bronchus to maintain
its patency.
The purpose of this study was to analyze the results of
the modified Montgomery T-tube in BI of lung trans￾plant patients over the past 4 years.
Materials and methods
We reviewed the data of all the lung transplantations
which were performed in the Lung Transplantation and
Thoracic Surgery department of Foch Hospital, Sur￾esnes, France between January 2007 and December
2010. All the patients with Montgomery T-Tube in BI
location were entered into this retrospective study.
Heart lung, bilateral lung, and single lung transplanta￾tion were performed according to the standard methods
[2,12]. End-to-end anastomosis with no revascularization
techniques had been applied.
All of the patients received triple immunosuppressive
therapy consisting of cyclosporine, azathioprine or
mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisone. Also chemopro￾phylaxis against pneumocystis jiroveci, and cytomegalo￾virus were given to the patients.
Surveillance bronchoscopy and transbronchial lung
biopsy were performed immediately after transplantation
and subsequently on postoperative day 7, month 1, 2, 3,
6, 9, 12, 18, and 24.
The severity of bronchial ischemia at the level of ana￾stomosis was assessed as following:
0: No ischemia.
1: Mild ischemia (one isolated ischemic patch or one
at the level of anastomosis)
2: Moderate ischemia (circumferential anastomotic
ischemia)
3: Severe ischemia (circumferential anastomotic ische￾mia and ischemia in segmental bronchi with or without
dehiscence)
In the case of airway complications including stenosis,
malacia, or obstructive necrotic tissues, rigid bronchoscopy
(KARL STORZ, Germany) was applied. It was performed
under general anesthesia and jet ventilation. Depending on
the pathological finding, the suitable interventions includ￾ing mechanical dilatation, laser, and cryotherapy were per￾formed. The dilatation was used when there was a
significant decline in forced expiratory volume in one sec￾ond (FEV1) with no other etiology or narrowing of the air￾way > 50% of predicted diameter. Additionally, the
Montgomery T-tube with appropriate size was inserted
when there was significant stenosis or malacia (Figure 2, 3)
but not necessarily after the first dilatation.
Spirometry was performed within 1 month intervals
and also before and after any bronchial interventions
when it was possible.
Statistical analysis
The data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for
Social Sciences (Version 14.0; SPSS
Inc., Chicago, IL). The variables are presented as per￾centages and means ± standard deviations. Descriptive

statistics were used to summarize the demographic
characteristics of the patients. For comparison of the
variables T-test was applied. P values less than 0.05
were considered significant.
Results
Out of 132 lung transplantations, 12 patients (male/
female: 9/3) with mean age of 37 ± 13.89 years were
enrolled into our study. The indications for lung trans￾plantation were: cystic fibrosis 8 (67%), emphysema 3
(25%), and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis 1 (8%). Most of
the patients (10/12) had bilateral lung transplantation.
The frequency of severe bronchial ischemia in one
month after transplantation was 41.5% in comparison of
8% in 7 days after operation (p = 0.03). The main clini￾cal data of the patients are shown in Table 1.
There was bronchial stenosis at the level of BI in 7
patients (58.3%). The Montgomery T-tube was placed in
all of the patients. Out of 12 patients, 3 (25%) had the
size of 12 and others (75%) size 10. The left side stent
was placed in 3 (25%) patients.
The data about rigid bronchoscopy are shown in
Table 2. The mean total times of 7.4 ± 2.6 rigid
bronchoscopy were performed in patients. There was
statistically significant difference between the mean
FEV1 before and after the stent placement (1762 ±
586.70 and 2351 ± 681.34 respectively, p = 0.01)

The minimum duration of follow up was 6 months.
The most common complication after stent placement
was migration of the stent (33%). The Montgomery T￾tube was extracted in 9 patients (75%). Seven patients
(58.3%) needed a new stent.
Discussion
Despite the progressions of surgical methods in lung
transplantation during recent years, airway complica￾tions are still a major concern in this field. The airway
complications after lung transplantation can be divided
in two phase: the early phase (during the first month
after transplantation) including anastomotic infection,
necrosis, or dehiscence which is mainly due to bronchial
ischemia and the late phase including excess granulation
tissue, bronchomalacia, and airway stenosis [3,7].
As we mentioned earlier, the main mechanism of
bronchial ischemia is the interruption of bronchial
blood flow after anastomosis [6,13]. Bronchial stenosis is
the most common airway complication and often occurs
in patients who have experienced anastomotic necrosis,
dehiscence, or infection [3,14]. In our study, overall 10
patients (84%) had significant stenosis.
During recent decades, many surgical methods have
been proposed for preventing of bronchial ischemia
[3,15], but only end-to-end anastomosis is the recom￾mended technique for it [3]. In our study, all of the lung
transplantation was performed with end-to-end anasto￾mosis method.
Since bronchial ischemia is a main underlying factor
in occurrence of airway complications, assessment of
the severity of ischemia seems to be necessary. We
designed a classification staging according to the severity
of ischemia on bronchoscopy. In our study 10 patients
(83%) had moderate to severe bronchial ischemia one
month after transplantation. The comparison of bron￾chial ischemia in day 7 and month 1 after transplanta￾tion showed the progressive nature of ischemia.
It is well documented that most airway complications
after lung transplantation occur at the anastomotic site
but sometimes nonanastomotic bronchial stenosis may
also occur [16]. Although the exact pathogenesis of this
type of stenosis is not clear, but alloreactive injury,
ischemic damage, and infection may concern [16]. Sev￾eral cases of bronchial stenosis distal to the anastomotic
site in the BI have been reported [17]. In our study, 59%
of bronchial stenosis was in BI without involvement of
anastomosis. This type of stenosis is known as the van￾ishing bronchus intermedius syndrome that may be
detected as late as 12 months post transplant [7,17].

The mean interval between transplantation and stent
placement was 11.5 months in this study.
Management of the bronchial stenosis depends on
severity of narrowing. Different modalities like mechani￾cal dilatation, laser, cryotherapy, and stent are applied in
appropriate indications [18]. In the case of nonanasto￾motic bronchial stenosis, the therapeutic options are not
different. But it is necessary to keep a stent in the cor￾rect position without occlusion of the right upper lobe
bronchus. We used modified Montgomery T-tube as
shown in Figure 1, 2, and 3. By this method, the right
upper bronchus will be kept open.
In our study, the most common complication was
migration. If we could use an appropriate diameter T￾tube stent which is fit to the BI, the complication may
be lowered. The special designed T-tube stents suitable
for BI in diameter may lower the risk of complications
like migration.
Conclusions
Airway complications after lung transplantation are still
a managing problem; especially when they are located in
BI. For maintaining the patency of BI, especial stents are
required because of the position of right upper
bronchus. We used modified Montgomery T-tube for
this purpose. But due to complications like migration,
especially designed stents compatible with diameter of
BI and main bronchus are nowadays applied. So we
expect that the efficiency of this endoscopic procedure
will be increased because there is no real efficient treat￾ment of this type of post lung transplantation bronchial
complication.
