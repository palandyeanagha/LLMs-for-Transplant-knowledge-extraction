Introduction
The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), consisting of ulcerative 
colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD), are characterized by chronic 
inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract in genetically suscepti￾ble individuals exposed to environmental risk factors. The etiology 
of IBD has been extensively investigated in the past few decades, 
but its pathogenesis is not fully understood (1–3). While the study 
of IBD has been largely focused on the roles played by the classi￾cal components of the immune system, other reports have called 
attention to the significant contribution of nonimmune cells, such 
as epithelial, endothelial, mesenchymal, and vascular cells (4–6). In 
particular, there is a growing body of evidence showing that IBD is 
associated with the development of new blood (angiogenesis) and 
lymph (lymphangiogenesis) vessels from the existing vascular net￾work (7–10). Although the pathogenic role of angiogenesis in IBD 
is well understood (11), whether lymphangiogenesis plays a pro￾tective or pathogenic role is still unknown. Recent studies demon￾strated that lymphatic vessels (LVs) are functionally important 
for the resolution of intestinal inflammation. For example, mice 
deficient for angiopoietin-2 show intestinal lymphatic dysplasia 
and exacerbated colitis in the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) colitis 
model (12, 13), while selective ablation of the LVs leads to distortion 
of the intestinal villi architecture and severe bowel inflammation 
(14). Although the precise pathophysiology of IBD is unknown, 
LV obstruction and dysfunction are long-recognized features 
observed in humans with this disease (15, 16). The existence of an 
abnormal lymphatic system is further supported by a recent article 
describing defective drainage capacity of LVs in human CD bowel 
strictures (17). Moreover, among patients with CD, relatively lower 
LV density was associated with a higher risk of endoscopic disease 
recurrence after surgery, suggesting that patients could benefit 
from improved lymphatic flow (18). In an animal model of intes￾tinal ileitis, impaired contractile function of mesenteric collecting 
lymphatics was observed both in vivo and in vitro, again showing a 
strong correlation with the degree of mucosal inflammation (19). 
Nevertheless, together with LV dysfunction, macrophages (MΦs) 
may also have a fundamental contribution to IBD pathogenesis. 
They have been found to play opposing roles in experimental mod￾els of intestinal inflammation, such as the DSS and IL-10–KO mod￾els of colitis (20, 21). In fact, while classically activated M1 MΦs 
contribute to the pathogenesis of these 2 models of experimental 
colitis primarily by secreting proinflammatory cytokines, such as 
IL-6, TNF-α and IFN-γ, and causing tissue damage (22), alterna￾tively activated M2 MΦs contribute to the resolution of colitis pri￾marily by expressing low levels of proinflammatory cytokines, but 
high levels of arginase 1 (Arg-1), FIZZ1, YM-1, and IL-10 (20, 23, 
24). Thus, the factors that modulate MΦ polarization could affect 
the severity of human and experimental colitis. These observa￾tions suggest that resolution of chronic inflammation may require 
restoration of proper lymphatic function and proper MΦ activation 
Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) of unknown etiology that are 
associated with an aberrant mucosal immune response. Neoangiogenesis and vascular injury are observed in IBD along with 
increased lymphangiogenesis. While the pathogenic role of angiogenesis in IBD is well characterized, it is not clear how or 
if increased lymphangiogenesis promotes disease. Here, we determined that enhancing lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic 
function reduces experimental IBD. Specifically, we demonstrated that adenoviral induction of prolymphangiogenic factor 
VEGF-C provides marked protection against the development of acute and chronic colitis in 2 different animal models. 
VEGF-C–dependent protection was observed in combination with increased inflammatory cell mobilization and bacterial 
antigen clearance from the inflamed colon to the draining lymph nodes. Moreover, we found that the VEGF-C/VEGFR3 
pathway regulates macrophage (MΦ) plasticity and activation both in cultured MΦs and in vivo, imparting a hybrid M1-M2 
phenotype. The protective function of VEGF-C was meditated by the so-called resolving MΦs during chronic experimental 
colitis in a STAT6-dependent manner. Together, these findings shed light on the contribution of lymphatics to the 
pathogenesis of gut inflammation and suggest that correction of defective lymphatic function with VEGF-C has potential as a 
therapeutic strategy for IBD.

groups (Figure 1C, lower panel), and for this reason, it was subse￾quently excluded from the study. Frozen sections double-stained 
with anti-LYVE1 and anti-VEGFR3 Abs showed increased 
VEGFR3+
 vessel density in inflamed tissue compared with that 
seen in quiescent LVs in control sections (Figure 1, D and E). Coex￾pression of VEGFR3 and LYVE1 was quantified using the method 
described by Tammela et al. (36), which measures the fluorescent 
intensity of target expression normalized per vascular area. This 
revealed a lymphatic-specific increase in VEGFR3 (Figure 1F), 
but not LYVE1 (Figure 1G), in CD and UC sections compared with 
that seen in control tissues, suggesting that inflammation also 
increases VEGFR3 expression in individual vessels. Collectively, 
these data demonstrate that mucosal lymphatic vascularization is 
increased in active IBD–involved tissues and suggest that chronic 
inflammation stimulates the VEGF-C/VEGFR3 pathway, a finding 
compatible with inflammation-associated lymphangiogenesis.
Role of VEGFR3 signaling in human intestinal lymphatic endo￾thelial cell behavior in vitro. Proliferation, migration, and capillary 
reorganization are all processes necessary for lymphatic regener￾ation (37). To assess the role of VEGFR3 and its ligand VEGF-C 
in human intestinal lymphatic endothelial cell (HILEC) behavior, 
these cells were isolated from normal and IBD mucosa, as described 
in the Supplemental Information (supplemental material avail￾able online with this article; doi:10.1172/JCI72189DS1), and their 
biological functions were characterized in vitro. Medium supple￾mented with VEGF-C promoted the proliferation (Supplemental 
Figure 1A), migration (Supplemental Figure 1B), and capillary 
formation (Supplemental Figure 1, C and D) of both control (NL) 
and IBD HILECs, with a significantly greater response by IBD 
HILECs when compared with that by NL cells. VEGF156 mutant, 
a selective agonist that specifically binds VEGFR3, induced sim￾ilar results, indicating that the effects of VEGF-C do not require 
VEGFR2 binding. After 96 hours of VEGF-C/VEGF156 treatment, 
blocking the activation of VEGFR3 (SAR131675) (38) significantly 
inhibited both basal and VEGF-C– or VEGF156-induced prolifer￾ation (Supplemental Figure 1A), migration (Supplemental Figure 
1B), and tube formation (Supplemental Figure 1, C and D), with 
similar effects in NL and IBD HILECs, showing that VEGFR3 acti￾vation is necessary for these biological functions. We found that 
cell lysates from VEGF-C–stimulated NL and IBD HILECs dis￾played increased VEGFR3 phosphorylation (p-Tyr), which in turn 
was inhibited upon SAR131675 treatment (Supplemental Figure 
1E). Moreover, overexpression of VEGFR3 in IBD HILECs con￾firmed what we observed by immunofluorescence (see Figure 1) 
and demonstrated that our method of isolation could represent a 
novel tool for in vitro study of lymphatics in IBD.
Systemic delivery of VEGF-C significantly improved experimen￾tal colitis both clinically and histologically. Since VEGFR3 signaling 
is essential for lymphangiogenesis in various conditions (26, 39), 
we sought to determine whether the pathway was also important 
for lymphangiogenesis in chronic experimental colitis. For this 
purpose, we studied the functional role of the VEGF-C/VEGFR3 
pathway in vivo by systemic inhibition of VEGFR3 (15) or by deliv￾ery of the human lymphangiogenic factor VEGF-C in DSS and 
IL-10–KO models of chronic colitis using a blocking Ab or adeno￾viral transfer, respectively. Mice undergoing 2 cycles of DSS treat￾ment and 15-week-old IL-10–KO animals with established colitis 
because of the essential importance of maintaining normal flow 
balance and removing inflammatory cells, mediators, and bacterial 
antigens away from inflamed sites (25).
Lymphangiogenesis is mediated by binding of the lymphatic 
vascular endothelial selective growth factors VEGF-C and VEGF-D 
to VEGFR3 (26, 27). VEGFR3, also known as Flt4, was the first lym￾phatic-specific growth factor receptor identified (28), and its neu￾tralization by specific antibodies reduces bacterial infection asso￾ciated–airway inflammation (29) and surgical blockade–induced 
lymphangiogenesis (30, 31). Moreover, antilymphatic treatment 
with anti-VEGFR3 antibodies in an animal model of IBD aggravates 
inflammation and submucosal edema, increases leukocyte infiltra￾tion, and causes the LVs to become tortuous (13, 32). VEGF-C is also 
chemotactic for MΦs during pathological conditions, and its recep￾tor VEGFR3 is expressed by a substantial fraction of peripheral 
blood monocytes and activated tissue MΦs (33, 34). Overall, these 
studies have established a direct role for VEGF-C/VEGFR3 sig￾naling in inflammation-induced lymphangiogenesis and immune 
response and suggest that therapies aimed at promoting lymphatic 
function, e.g., with prolymphangiogenic factors, such as VEGF-C, 
may provide a novel strategy for the treatment of inflammatory con￾ditions, including IBD. In the current study, we examined the effect 
of stimulating lymphatic function and adaptive immune response 
via VEGF-C/VEGFR3 signaling on the severity of intestinal inflam￾mation, on lymphatic drainage, as well as on bacterial antigen clear￾ance and MΦ activation during inflammatory conditions. Further￾more, we evaluated the mechanism through which this pathway 
acts in experimental disease progression.
Results
LV density and the VEGF-C/VEGFR3 pathway are altered in active 
IBD–involved colons. To assess whether lymphangiogenesis occurs 
in human IBD, we performed immunohistochemical staining of 
control and active CD– and UC–involved colons with antibodies 
recognizing podoplanin, a widely accepted marker of lymphatic 
vasculature (9, 10, 35). Normal colon mucosa only showed spo￾radic, thin LVs in the lamina propria and submucosa, whereas CD 
and UC tissues contained numerous, readily detectable dilated LVs 
(Figure 1A). Quantitative analysis of the same sections revealed 
that the total number of LVs per field in the lamina propria and sub￾mucosa of both CD and UC specimens was significantly increased 
compared with that of the control non-IBD tissue (Figure 1B), thus 
confirming the occurrence of lymphangiogenesis in IBD patients.
The molecular mechanisms of inflammation-induced lymph￾angiogenesis remain largely unknown. Reports showing inhibition 
of LV growth by blockade of VEGFR3 signaling demonstrate the 
involvement of this receptor in inflammation-driven lymphangio￾genesis (29). To verify whether the VEGF-C/VEGFR3 pathway is 
involved in intestinal inflammation–dependent lymphangiogene￾sis, control and active CD– and UC–involved colons were analyzed 
for the expression of these 2 molecules. Figure 1C (upper panel) 
shows that compared with control tissues, VEGF-C expression 
was upregulated in the mucosal extracts of patients with IBD. 
The higher VEGF-C levels observed in UC patients compared 
with those in CD patients may be the result of a greater degree 
of mucosal inflammation in the UC samples. Notably, the other 
VEGFR3 ligand VEGF-D showed comparable amounts in all

with that of control groups (only DSS-treated and IL-10 WT mice). 
Notably, DSS-treated mice showed similar effects also in the acute 
phase of inflammation (Figure 2, A and E, and Supplemental Fig￾ure 2, B and D). Protection against chronic colitis by VEGF-C in 
these 2 experimental models was paralleled by histological exami￾nation, in which we also observed reduced inflammatory cell infil￾tration into the intestinal mucosa and diminished submucosal 
edema (Figure 2, D and E).
The VEGF-C/VEGFR3 pathway is required for lymphangiogenesis 
in experimental colitis. Lymphatics expanded dramatically during 
DSS-induced acute and chronic colitis. Frozen sections from the 
colon of control (untreated) or DSS-treated (colitic) mice were dou￾ble stained with anti-LYVE1 and anti-VEGFR3 Abs, and VEGFR3+
LVs were quantified in 10 regions per section. The results showed 
an increase in VEGFR3+
 vessel density in inflamed tissues com￾pared with LVs in control tissues (Supplemental Figure 3, A and B). 
were injected with adenoviruses encoding human VEGF-C (Ad￾hVEGF-C) or with the anti-VEGFR3 Ab mF431C1. Western blot 
and immunoprecipitation analyses of tissue lysates obtained from 
the colons of each experimental group clearly showed the efficient 
inhibition of VEGFR3 phosphorylation and upregulation of Ad￾hVEGF-C at the indicated time points (Supplemental Figure 2A and 
data not shown). Notably, in the DSS model, we found that VEGFR3 
protein levels were increased during both the acute and chronic 
phases of intestinal inflammation (Supplemental Figure 2A).
Systemic delivery of Ad-hVEGF-C significantly reduced the 
severity of chronic intestinal inflammation in both experimental 
models in terms of percentage of body weight (Figure 2, A and B), 
endoscopic evaluation (Figure 2C and Supplemental Figure 2B), 
and disease activity index (DAI, a combinatorial score including 
stool blood, form, and body weight) (Supplemental Figure 2, C 
and D), whereas mF431C1 worsened the clinical course compared

observed in control tissues, suggesting that inflammation also 
increases VEGFR3 levels in individual vessels. In parallel, protein 
extracts from the colon of colitic mice showed increased VEGF-C 
expression levels compared with those in healthy animals (Supple￾Coexpression of VEGFR3 and LYVE1 was quantified, and the flu￾orescent intensity of target expression was normalized per vascu￾lar area. This revealed a lymphatic-specific increase in VEGFR3

colons of WT and colitic IL-10–KO mice were also double stained 
with anti-LYVE1 and anti-CD31 Abs (Figure 3C), and LYVE1+
 LVs 
were counted in 10 regions per section at the indicated time points. 
Our results showed that while systemic delivery of VEGF-C sig￾nificantly increased LV density, mF431C1 reduced the number of 
LVs per area compared with that in the WT control group (Figure 
3D). Notably, neither systemic inhibition of VEGFR3 nor delivery 
of the human lymphangiogenic factor VEGF-C affected the num￾ber of CD31+
 blood vessels in the inflamed colon (Figure 3E and 
data not shown). This indicates that this pathway does not influ￾ence angiogenesis during experimental colitis. Besides, except 
for increased lymphangiogenesis in various organs, such as the 
mental Figure 3D), as observed in human tissues (see Figure 1). We 
obtained Similar results with IL-10–KO animals (data not shown).
Whole mounts of proximal, distal, and rectal colonic seg￾ments from DSS-treated and untreated mice were stained with 
Abs against LYVE1 and CD31 to measure the area density and 
dimension of LVs during acute and chronic colitis. We found that 
systemic delivery of VEGF-C significantly increased lymphangio￾genesis at the indicated time points, both in terms of LV density 
(Figure 3, A and B) and size (Supplemental Figure 3E) in compar￾ison with the DSS-only control group. In contrast, mF431C1 had 
an inhibitory effect on LV dimension (Supplemental Figure 3E) 
and the number of LVs per area (Figure 3B). Frozen sections from

liver and spleen, we failed to find any evidence of inflammation or 
organ failure (data not shown), thus allowing us to conclude that 
no major systemic effects are expected upon treatment with this 
prolymphangiogenic factor. To determine the proliferative status 
of LVs at different stages of intestinal inflammation, untreated 
and VEGF-C– or mF431C1-treated colitic mice were injected 
with BrdU 2 hours prior to sacrifice. We costained the control and 
inflamed sections for BrdU in combination with anti-LYVE1 Ab 
and quantified the number of BrdU+
 cells per LV (Figure 4A). The 
results showed that systemic delivery of Ad-hVEGF-C enhanced 
LV proliferation in both the acute and chronic phases of DSS￾induced colitis (Figure 4B) and in colitic IL-10–KO animals (Fig￾ure 4C) when compared with control groups (UN and WT, respec￾tively). In contrast, mF431C1 treatment completely inhibited LV 
growth in both experimental models (Figure 4, B and C). LV mod￾ulation correlated with disease activity and weight loss, demon￾strating that the VEGF-C/VEGFR3 pathway is not only required 
for proper lymphangiogenesis during intestinal inflammation, but 
that lymphangiogenesis per se might be important for the resolu￾tion of inflammation.
Exacerbation of experimental colitis by VEGFR3 blockade is 
associated with decreased afferent lymph flow and inflammatory 
cell migration to draining nodes. Studies reporting abnormalities, 
such as submucosal edema, extensive dilation of lacteals (40, 41), 
lymphangitis, immune cell trafficking, and lymphangiogenesis 
(9, 42) in IBD patients suggest impaired lymph drainage and lym￾phatic pumping, implicating the lymphatic system as a player in 
various inflammatory disorders, including IBD. For this reason, 
we next investigated whether inhibition of lymphangiogenesis in 
mF431C1-treated mice is related to reduced lymphatic drainage 
and decreased inflammatory cell mobilization from the inflamed 
tissue to the draining lymph nodes (DLNs). To this end, we injected 
10 μg of Evans blue dye into the colonic mucosa of Ad-hVEGF-C–
treated and mF431C1-treated mice undergoing 2 cycles of DSS 
treatment, using DSS only–treated mice as a control group. Evans 
blue dye, which is specifically taken up by the lymphatic vascu￾lature (43), was then extracted 16 hours after its injection. The 
extraction of Evans blue dye from distal colons of comparable 
weight revealed that although lymphatic drainage was decreased 
in the chronic phase of colitis when compared with healthy 
(untreated) mice, it was enhanced by systemic delivery of VEGF-C 
(Figure 5A). By contrast, mF431C1-treated mice had significantly 
more dye remaining in the inflamed tissue than did mice treated 
with DSS alone (Figure 5A), suggestive of reduced lymphatic clear￾ance function. We obtained similar results with Ad-hVEGF-C– and 
mF431C1-treated IL-10–KO mice, using WT animals as a control 
group (Supplemental Figure 3F). We further determined the rate of 
inflammatory cell mobilization from healthy and inflamed colons 
to the DLNs by intramucosal injection of GFP+
 inflammatory cells 
(Figure 5B). Quantification of GFP+
 cells in the DLNs by immu￾nofluorescence (Figure 5C, upper panels) or FACS analysis (Fig￾ure 5C, lower panels) showed that systemic delivery of VEGF-C

(n = 10 fields/section for each group), and data are reported as the mean ± SEM. Black dashed lines represent the 2 DSS cycles. Red and green dashed lines 
indicate the first VEGF-C and mF431C1 administration, respectively. Scale bar: 28 μm. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.001 versus DSS alone.

considerably increased inflammatory cell migration, whereas sys￾temic inhibition of the receptor VEGFR3 reduced the mobilization 
rate of inflammatory cells from the inflamed colon (Figure 5, C and 
D). Overall, these data suggest that during experimental chronic 
colitis, the VEGF-C/VEGFR3 pathway plays a fundamental role 
in increasing lymph flow and inflammatory cell mobilization from 
the inflamed site to the DLNs, both of which are important events 
for inflammatory resolution.
Systemic delivery of VEGF-C accelerates antigen clearance from the 
inflamed colon to the DLNs through macrophage mobilization. One of 
the etiological theories on the pathogenesis of IBD is the impaired 
clearance of foreign material, leading to a sustained activation of 
innate immune cells and a compensatory induction of the adaptive 
immune response (44, 45). Indeed, delayed or ineffective clearance 
of bacteria that penetrate the intestinal mucosal barrier could pro￾long innate immune responses and enhance the presentation of 
bacterial antigens to facilitate the development of adaptive immune 
responses. Thus, while IBD may be due to an aberrant immune 
response against intestinal bacteria, slow or ineffective eradication 
of local bacteria may also be a key associated event contributing 
to disease pathogenesis (46). To ascertain whether the VEGF-C/
VEGFR3 pathway is involved in antigen clearance through local 
LVs and DLNs during intestinal inflammation, we administered a 
single intramucosal injection of carboxylated crimson fluorescent 
LPS–coated beads into colitic mice untreated or treated with Ad￾hVEGF-C and mF431C1 and monitored the clearance of the LPS￾coated beads into the DLNs 1 and 3 days after injection. Two differ￾ent populations of MΦs and DCs were characterized based on the 
expression of CD11b, CD11c, F4/80, and CD103, and, to avoid over￾estimation due to cells that had taken up more beads, we selected 
only cells that had taken up 1 bead over all bead+
 cells (Figure 6A). 
While systemic delivery of VEGF-C accelerated the clearance of 
single-bead+
 cells from the inflamed colon (Figure 6, B and C, left 
panels) to the DLNs (Figure 6, B and C, right panels) both 1 and 
Figure 5. Systemic delivery of VEGF-C markedly increases lymphatic drainage and mobilization of inflammatory cells from the inflamed colon to DLNs.
(A) 10 μg of Evans blue dye was injected into the colonic mucosa of healthy (UN, n = 4/time point), Ad-hVEGF-C– (n = 5/time point), and mF431C1-treated

monitored after treatment with clodronate-containing liposomes 
(CDLs), which have previously been shown to deplete MΦs in 
mouse colons (23, 24, 47). As shown in Supplemental Figure 5A, 
CDLs were effective at depleting different MΦ subpopulations 
when compared with PBS-injected mice. Interestingly, while in 
healthy mice, none of the MΦ subpopulations expressed VEGFR3, 
during inflammation, both CD11c–
 and CD11c+
 MΦs upregulated 
receptor levels on the cell membrane (Supplemental Figure 5, B 
and C), whereas DCs did not, thus explaining the specific effect 
of VEGF-C on the biological functions of these cells. While deple￾tion of MΦs by CDLs in VEGF-C–treated mice did not affect DSS￾induced LV size (Figure 7A), number (Figure 7B, left panel), or 
lymph flow (Figure 7B, right panel), it did partially restore the 
phenotype of untreated colitic animals in terms of DSS-induced 
weight loss (Figure 7C), histological score (Figure 7D and Supple￾mental Figure 6A left panel), and DAI (Supplemental Figure 6A, 
right panel). This indicates that the denser and larger VEGF-C–
stimulated LV network in the gut is not sufficient per se to resolve 
inflammation but is accompanied by the role of MΦs. We achieved 
comparable results with IL-10–KO animalas (data not shown).
3 days after injection, systemic inhibition of VEGFR3 blocked this 
effect. As a control, we also determined whether the uptake of 
coated beads differed between the various cell populations. Coated 
beads were taken up efficiently by both CD45+
 intestinal MΦs and 
DCs 12 hours after the injection (Supplemental Figure 4A).
We then analyzed the phenotype of cleared LPS-coated 
bead+
 cells in the DLNs 3 days after injection and found that 
systemic delivery of Ad-hVEGF-C accelerated the migration of 
both CD11c–
 and CD11c+
 MΦs, but had no effect on CD11b– and 
CD11b+
 DCs (Supplemental Figure 4, B and C). In contrast, block￾ing of VEGFR3 activation led to the inhibition of both CD11c–
 and 
CD11c+
 MΦ migration toward the DLNs without influencing DC 
clearance (Supplemental Figure 4, B and C), thus demonstrating 
the specific role of the VEGF-C/VEGFR3 signaling pathway in 
bacterial antigen clearance by MΦs.
Depleting MΦs eliminates protection in VEGF-C–treated mice 
during chronic experimental colitis. To determine whether the pro￾tection seen in VEGF-C–treated mice during disease progression 
was at least in part the result of VEGF-C–induced MΦ activa￾tion, clinical parameters, lymph flow, and edema formation were

ure 8A), but these MΦs also expressed high levels of typical M1 
markers, such as Cox2, MHCII, iNOS, and CD80 (Figure 8B), thus 
reflecting a hybrid phenotype. When we examined the expression 
levels of intracellular cAMP, typically increased in this hybrid so￾called “resolution-phase” subpopulation (48), we found that they 
were significantly elevated in MΦs isolated from VEGF-C–treated 
colitic mice compared with the levels detected in their untreated 
counterparts (Supplemental Figure 6C), confirming the presence 
of a “resolving” MΦ subpopulation. As shown in Figure 8, A and 
B, and Supplemental Figure 6C, MΦs isolated from the colons of 
mF431C1-treated mice revealed an opposite effect. We obtained 
similar results with IL-10–KO animals (data not shown).
To assess the putative mechanism by which VEGF-C mediates 
MΦ plasticity and polarized activation, we subjected BM-derived 
MΦs from healthy untreated animals to in vitro M1 (by LPS) and 
M2 (by IL-4) polarization and VEGF-C stimulation. Our results 
The VEGF-C/VEGFR3 pathway regulates in vivo and in vitro 
MΦ plasticity and activation. Assessing the putative phenotype of 
VEGF-C–induced MΦs in colitic mice, we compared our in vivo–
derived colonic MΦs from VEGF-C–treated animals with those 
from untreated mice, both in the inflammatory phase of colitis. 
The release of IL-6, TNF-α, and IFN-γ was significantly lower in 
the culture of colonic MΦs from VEGF-C–induced animals com￾pared with that in the untreated colitic controls, in which cyto￾kine levels were expectedly elevated (Supplemental Figure 6B). In 
contrast, MΦs isolated from the colons of mF431C1-treated mice 
revealed an opposite effect (Supplemental Figure 6B). This is con￾sistent with the protective role of the VEGF-C/VEGFR3 pathway 
in experimental colitis induced by DSS. Interestingly, MΦs from 
VEGF-C–treated mice were alternatively activated, producing 
increased levels of the M2 markers Ym1, Fizz1, Arg1, and IL-10 
compared with those detected in untreated colitic animals (Fig￾Figure 7. MΦ depletion using CDL reduces protection of VEGF-C–overexpressing mice during DSS-induced colitis. Mice undergoing 2 cycles of DSS

showing that the VEGF-C/VEGFR3 pathway directly modulates 
STAT6 activation during experimental colitis and in cultured BM–
derived MΦs. In addition, inhibition of STAT6 in VEGF-C–treated 
cells using a specific siRNA abolished the effect of this growth factor 
on the expression of M2- (Figure 9B and Supplemental Figure 7A) 
and M1- (Figure 9C and Supplemental Figure 7B) associated genes 
and on MΦ migration through matrigel-coated filters (Supple￾mental Figure 7C), whereas the scramble control did not, demon￾strating that the VEGF-C/VEGFR3 pathway directly controls MΦ
plasticity and migration in a STAT6-dependent manner. Finally, 
since we demonstrated that the protection seen in VEGF-C–
treated mice during disease progression was at least in part the 
result of resolving MΦ activation, we investigated the mechanism 
through which this pathway confers protection during DSS-in￾duced colonic inflammation. For this purpose, we injected in vitro 
VEGF-C–induced rMΦs isolated from the BM of GFP mice into the 
rectal mucosa of colitic mice every 96 hours and monitored the 
clinical parameters at different time points for the entire experi￾ment (Figure 9D). Notably, 48 hours after the injection, we still 
found GFP+
 MΦs in the colons of colitic mice, while we no longer 
detected these cells after 96 hours (data not shown), thus allowing 
us to determine the injection intervals. These animals showed ame￾liorated clinical parameters in terms of body weight (Figure 9E), 
showed that VEGF-C alone strongly increased both M1 and M2 
gene expression, almost comparable to that seen in control cells 
stimulated with LPS or IL-4 alone (Figure 8C and Supplemental 
Figure 6D); these outcomes were abolished upon treatment with 
the anti-VEGFR3 Ab (Figure 8C and Supplemental Figure 6D). 
Overall, these data confirm the induction of a unique in vitro 
mixed M1-M2 subpopulation, as observed in vivo, and demon￾strate a direct effect of the VEGF-C/VEGFR3 pathway not only on 
MΦ-mediated bacterial antigen clearance (Figure 6) but also on 
MΦ plasticity and polarization (Figure 8).
Resolving MΦs mediate the protective role of the VEGF-C/
VEGFR3 pathway during chronic experimental colitis in a STAT6-
dependent manner. At the transcriptional levels, IL-4–induced 
differentiation of alternatively activated MΦs and the expression 
of genes such as MHC class II are mediated by the transcription 
factor STAT6 (49, 50). For this reason, we asked whether VEGF-C 
induced the expression and/or activation of STAT6 in the resolu￾tion-phase subpopulation of MΦs (rMΦs). Upon VEGF-C treat￾ment, the amount of total STAT6 remained comparable to that in 
the untreated cells, whereas increased levels of phosphorylated 
STAT6 (p-STAT6) were detected, in both in vivo– (Figure 9A, left 
panel) and in vitro BM–derived differentiated MΦs (Figure 9A, 
right panel). This effect was inhibited by mF431C1 (Figure 9A),

and submucosal edema is a typical feature of IBD tissues despite 
early abundant lymphatic vasculature. Nevertheless, only limited 
information is available on the clearance capacity of LVs in IBD 
(17), and some of the lymphatics might be immature or nonfunc￾tional, as appears to be the case in tumor-associated lymphangio￾genesis (51, 52). Recent work by Tammela et al. (53) demonstrated 
that by stimulating the VEGFR3 tyrosine kinase by treatment with 
the lymphangiogenic factor VEGF-C, it is possible to regener￾ate functional collecting LVs in mice following lymph node (LN) 
dissection. As VEGFR3 activity plays important roles in both the 
maintenance and survival of lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) 
and vascular integrity, decreased VEGFR3 expression or signal￾ing might alter many lymphatic functions, leading to increased 
gut injury. Indeed, antilymphatic treatment with anti-VEGFR3 
antibodies aggravated inflammation and submucosal edema, 
increasing leukocyte infiltration in an animal model of IBD (13). 
In the current study, we demonstrate activation of the VEGF-C/
VEGFR3 pathway in the actively inflamed mucosa of patients with 
IBD. Except for VEGF-D, another VEGFR3 ligand whose levels 
remain stable in actively inflamed intestinal tissues, expression of 
both VEGF-C and VEGFR3 was significantly increased in biopsy 
DAI (Figure 9F), and colon length (Supplemental Figure 7D) when 
compared with those of the untreated animals. This protective role 
was abolished by STAT6-silenced VEGF-C–induced MΦs (Fig￾ure 9, E and F, and Supplemental Figure 7D), demonstrating, for 
the first time to our knowledge, one of the mechanisms of action 
through which VEGF-C/VEGFR3 signaling abates the severity 
of experimental colitis.
Discussion
In this study, we report that the specific promotion of LV function 
limits experimental chronic intestinal inflammation in mice that 
is mediated by a unique MΦ polarization and activation and mod￾ification of the tissue cytokine milieu. These novel findings are 
important because, although the precise pathophysiology of IBD 
is unknown, LV obstruction and dysfunction are long-recognized 
features observed in humans with this disease (15, 16), and nor￾malizing gut lymphatics with prolymphangiogenic factors such 
as VEGF-C may improve disease activity. Consistent with altered 
lymphatic contractile function reported in an animal model of acute 
intestinal inflammation (19), intestinal lymphatics are known to be 
grossly abnormal in the gut of CD patients (10). Moreover, mucosal

role in mediating post-resolution innate lymphocyte repopulation 
and restoring tissue homeostasis (48, 68). We show that adoptive 
transfer of VEGF-C–differentiated resolving MΦs in colitic mice 
inhibited the clinical parameters of DSS-induced chronic colitis, 
in agreement with reports demonstrating that in vitro–differenti￾ated monocytes have antiinflammatory properties or enhance the 
resolution of inflammation (23, 69). In addition, we discovered 
that the polarization and resolving actions of MΦs are mediated 
by the VEGF-C/VEGFR3 pathway through STAT6 activation. 
This is intriguing, because some reports suggest that there may 
be a dysregulation of STAT6 signaling in the ungoverned immune 
response associated with colitis (70–72), and this transcription fac￾tor plays a regulatory role in the pathogenesis of IBD (73),
Although not assessed in our study, it would be of interest 
to investigate the in vivo beneficial effects of VEGF-C–activated 
MΦs in terms of T cell immunosuppression and the potential role 
of DLN lymphangiogenesis in the control of intestinal inflamma￾tion (74, 75). The increased drainage capacity and resolution of 
chronic intestinal inflammation might, at least in part, be medi￾ated by enhanced VEGF-C–induced DLN lymphangiogenesis in 
addition to the increased lymphangiogenesis we observed in the 
inflamed colon itself. Nevertheless, we cannot fully exclude the 
possibility that other VEGF-C activities, including other direct 
effects on the inflamed lymphatic vasculature, are involved in the 
antiinflammatory properties of VEGF-C.
In conclusion, our study provides the first proof of concept 
to our knowledge that it may be possible to treat chronic gastro￾intestinal inflammatory disorders by stimulating LV functions to 
promote drainage and bacterial antigen clearance, together with 
adaptive immunity, effects achievable through modulation of the 
VEGF-C/VEGFR3 pathway. In fact, increased VEGF-C expres￾sion levels found in mucosal extracts of patients with IBD could be 
insufficient to promote proper lymphatic function and MΦ-polar￾ized activation and migration. VEGF-C gene therapy can induce 
growth of new LVs in the skin of Chy mice, suggesting that some 
forms of lymphedema might be treated by similar approaches in 
humans (59). In addition, use of VEGF-C plasmid in rabbit ear and 
mouse tail lymphedema models results in amelioration of lym￾phatic function and alleviation of the signs of lymphedema (61). 
Thus, these and our own observations support the potential use of 
lymphangiogenic growth factors as a novel therapeutic approach 
for the treatment of IBD and other chronic inflammatory diseases.
Methods
Patients
Intestinal tissues from involved areas were obtained from surgical 
specimens of patients with CD and UC. Healthy tissues from the 
intestine of patients admitted for bowel resection due to colon cancer, 
polyps, or diverticulosis were used as controls. Specimens were for￾malin fixed and paraffin embedded or frozen in Cryoblock Compound 
(DiaPath) on dry ice and stored at –80°C.
Mice
Mice used in this study were male or female C57BL/6 (Charles 
River Laboratories) or Il10tm1Cgn (IL-10–KO) and IL-10 WT mice on a 
C57BL/10 background and were provided by Giovanni Pietrogrande 
specimens from inflamed bowel segments when compared with 
those in controls, a finding compatible with inflammation-associ￾ated lymphangiogenesis. Similarly, we found that the expression 
of VEGF-C and its receptor, both expressed in colon tissue under 
physiologic conditions, was markedly enhanced during experi￾mental colitis in 2 different animal models: the chronic DSS and 
the IL-10–KO models, (54, 55). Thus, these models offer a good 
platform for manipulating the VEGF-C/VEGFR3 pathway and 
verify its effect on the course of experimental intestinal inflamma￾tion. Indeed, we demonstrated that systemic inhibition of VEGFR3 
blocked lymphangiogenesis, reducing both area density and LV 
dimension and growth, while significantly increasing inflamma￾tory edema formation and inhibiting disease resolution, as also 
observed by Jurisic et al. (13). In contrast, lymphatic drainage was 
enhanced by systemic delivery of VEGF-C, which in turn signifi￾cantly induced LV density and proliferation, improving intestinal 
inflammation. The drainage-promoting function of VEGF-C in 
our models is in agreement with recent findings showing that the 
inhibition of VEGF-C by soluble VEGFR3 (sVEGFR3) significantly 
decreased lymph flow in a model of bacterial skin inflammation 
(56) and that genetic overexpression of sVEGFR3 in the skin of 
mice resulted in a lymphedema-like phenotype (57). Conversely, 
the application of VEGF-C or tumor-derived VEGF-C enhances 
lymphatic function and flow, respectively (53, 58–61).
As reported by others (62, 63), we did not detect any changes 
of the blood vasculature in VEGF-C–treated mice. Therefore, the 
improvement of experimental colitis mediated by systemic deliv￾ery of Ad-hVEGF-C is likely not caused by effects on blood ves￾sels. Interestingly, the enhanced lymphatic drainage by VEGF-C 
was observed in combination with increased inflammatory cell 
mobilization and bacterial antigen clearance, all LV functions 
that we found to be inhibited by VEGFR3 blockade. VEGF-C–
dependent antigen clearance was a MΦ-specific (both CD11c–
and CD11+
) effect, supported by the fact that these cells express 
VEGFR3 on the cell membrane during inflammation, whereas 
DCs do not. Such results suggest a potential role for VEGFR3 sig￾naling in immunity by mediating antigen-presenting cell (APC) 
trafficking through MΦ recruitment. The most intriguing and 
novel finding in this study is that the protection we observed in 
VEGF-C–treated mice during disease progression was not only 
a consequence of increased lymphangiogenesis and enhanced 
lymphatic flow and function, including mobilization of inflam￾matory cells and bacterial antigen clearance, but was also a result 
of a previously unknown direct VEGF-C–induced MΦ activation 
through STAT6 signaling. The MΦ has long been considered part 
of the destructive force behind IBD as a result of its involvement 
in regulating inflammation through the production of inflamma￾tory cytokines and chemokines (64–66). When activated, MΦs 
can be functionally divided into the classically activated, or M1, 
type and the alternatively activated, or M2, type in response to 
the different stimuli of the local microenvironment (67). Our 
data show that administration of VEGF-C activates a hybrid MΦ
phenotype, with a direct effect on cell migration and expression 
of both M1 and M2 markers, with opposite effects observed upon 
blocking of VEGFR3. This specific subpopulation has already been 
observed in a peritoneal model of inflammation, in which the so￾called rMΦs expressed a unique mixed M1-M2 phenotype, with a

later. Mice were killed at the indicated time points (Supplemental 
Figure 3), and mucosal extracts were analyzed by Western blotting to 
determine VEGF-C expression and inhibition of VEGFR3 activity. All 
experiments were performed twice, using 4–8 mice per experimen￾tal group. Adenoviral preparation was free from contamination with 
helper viruses, bacteria, or LPS.
Immunostaining of human and murine colonic tissues
Human. To quantify LV density, the number of podoplanin+
 LVs was 
assessed in inflamed areas of surgical specimens from patients with 
CD and UC (IBD). Normal areas of the intestine from patients admitted 
for bowel resection due to colon cancer, polyps, or diverticulosis were 
used as controls (NL). Tissues were fixed in 10% buffered formalin, pro￾cessed, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin or immunostained with 
specific Abs. Sections (2-μm-thick) of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embed￾ded tissues were deparaffinized in Bioclear (Bioptica) and rehydrated in 
a descending ethanol series. Following antigen retrieval by heating for 
10 minutes in a microwave with EDTA buffer (pH 8.0; 0.25 mM), sec￾tions were incubated for 20 minutes with peroxidase 1 solution (Biocare 
Medical) to quench endogenous tissue peroxidase. Tissue slides were 
then incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature (RT) in a humid 
chamber with mouse anti-human podoplanin mAb (clone D2-40, 
1:100; ABD Serotec), and staining was completed using the Biocare 
Medical HRP-conjugated mouse detection kit and DAB chromogen 
as a substrate, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Last, sec￾tions were counterstained with CAT Hematoxylin (Biocare Medical) for 
5 minutes. After staining, the slides were dehydrated through graded 
alcohols and mounted with a coverslip using Eukitt Quick Hardening 
Mounting Media (Fluka Analytical, Sigma-Aldrich). Negative controls, 
with omission of the primary incubation, were also included. The slides 
were analyzed randomly by 2 of the authors blinded to the clinical data.
LV density was quantified in the submucosal and subserosal lay￾ers, both areas that are richly vascularized by lymphatic capillaries. 
Only vessels stained with podoplanin and visible lumina were con￾sidered countable, because small nerve fibers and fibroblasts also 
expressed podoplanin (81) and potentially could be confused with col￾lapsed lymphatic capillaries. The mean vessel density of 10 areas with 
an elevated number of LVs in the ×20 magnification objective field 
were assessed separately using VS-ASW software (Olympus).
Mouse. To achieve labeling of LECs undergoing DNA synthesis, 
untreated and treated mice subjected to the DSS protocol or WT and 
IL-10–KO treated animals received an i.p. injection of 100 mg/kg 
BrdU 2 hours prior to sacrifice. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded 
colon sections (2-μm), at the indicated time points (Figure 4), were 
double-stained for LYVE1 and BrdU after antigen retrieval for 30 min￾utes at 98°C in citric buffer (10 mM, pH 6.0). Following endogenous 
peroxidase blocking with peroxidase 1 solution for 20 minutes at RT, 
tissues were washed in TBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 instead of 
PBS to reduce alkaline phosphatase aspecific staining. Upon incuba￾tion with the goat anti-mouse LYVE1 (1:100; R&D Systems) primary 
Ab for 90 minutes at RT, sections were stained with rat anti-BrdU Ab 
(1:600; AbD Serotec) for 40 minutes at 4°C (Biocare Medical). A rat 
HRP polymer kit (Biocare Medical) was used to detect BrdU using DAB 
(Biocare Medical) as chromogen, followed by the Goat AP-Polymer Kit 
(Biocare Medical) to detect LYVE1 with Warp Red (Biocare Medical) as 
an alkaline phosphatase substrate. Tissue sections were then counter￾stained with CAT Hematoxylin (Biocare Medical), dried overnight in a 
(Ospedale San Raffaele, Milan, Italy). All animals were maintained 
under pathogen-free conditions. 
Induction and evaluation of colonic inflammation
As reported previously (54), 3- to 4-week-old IL-10–KO mice consis￾tently develop colitis at 10 to 12 weeks of age when transported from 
the ultrabarrier facility (UBF) to conventional housing. Clinical signs of 
inflammation are diarrhea, perianal ulceration, intestinal bleeding, and 
occasional rectal prolapse (76, 77). Intestinal histopathology of IL-10–
KO mice shares some features with human CD. The inflammatory pro￾cess is indeed characterized by focal transmural inflammation, mucosal 
proliferation, focal ulceration, and extensive infiltration of lymphocytes, 
plasma cells, MΦs, and scattered neutrophils. IL-10 WT animals were 
used as controls. A slightly modified version of the previously described 
DAI (54) was calculated by scoring 1 point for the appearance of each of 
the following: occult fecal blood, as determined on a Hemoccult SENSA 
Card (Beckman Coulter), rectal prolapse, diarrhea, or more than 5% 
weight loss. A 5-point (0–4) DAI was thus obtained.
For the DSS-induced chronic colitis model, 8- to 12-week-old 
female mice were subjected to 2 oral cycles of 2.5% DSS (molecular 
mass, 40 kDa; MP Biomedicals), each cycle characterized by 10 days 
of DSS exposure followed by 11 days of filter-purified water (78). The 
control mice group received water without DSS. In this model, the DAI 
scale is based on the evaluation of different parameters characterizing 
experimental colitis induction and progression. Body weight, presence 
of gross blood in the feces, and stool consistency were recorded at the 
indicated time points (Figure 2 and Supplemental Figure 2). According 
to the criteria proposed by Cooper et al. (79), the DAI was determined 
by scoring changes in: weight loss (0 = none, 1 = 1%–5%, 2 = 5%–10%, 
3 = 10%–20%, 4 = >20%); stool consistency (0 = normal, 2 = loose, 
4 = diarrhea); and rectal bleeding (0 = normal, 2 = occult bleeding, 
4 = gross bleeding). A 5-point (0–4) DAI was thus obtained.
For both models, mice were sacrificed at the indicated time points 
(Figure 2), and grading of intestinal inflammation was confirmed 
histologically in a blinded fashion, as previously described (8, 80). 
Colons of colitic mice and healthy controls were evaluated for histo￾logical analyses using 2-μM paraffin-embedded sections, stained with 
hematoxylin (Dako) and eosin (Diapath). A blinded pathologist evalu￾ated the degree of inflammatory cell infiltration and mucosal damage, 
as previously described (8). In parallel experiments, colonic biopsies 
were embedded in Cryoblock Compound for immunofluorescence 
studies or immediately frozen on dry ice for Western blot analyses.
VEGFR3 Ab blockade. Fifteen-week-old IL-10–KO and WT mice 
(not shown) with fully established colitis, as determined by weight 
loss, diarrhea, bloody stools, and rectal prolapse, were given i.p. injec￾tions of an anti-VEGFR3 Ab, mF431C1 (clone 31C1, 800 μg/100 μl of 
PBS per mouse; ImClone Systems) (27), or PBS alone 3 times per week 
for a period of 5 weeks. In the DSS model of colitis, mF431C1 or PBS 
was administered i.p. 3 times per week for the entire experiment, start￾ing from the first day of DSS administration.
Ad-hVEGF-C administration. Fourteen-week-old IL-10–KO and 
WT mice (not shown) with fully established colitis were given i.v. 
injections of an engineered Ad-hVEGF-C or a control virus encoding 
GFP (Ad-GFP) (5 × 108
 PFU per mouse; ViraQuest). A second dose of

30 minutes at RT with Alexa Fluor 647–conjugated anti-mouse (1:1,000; 
Invitrogen), followed by incubation with DAPI (1:25,000; Invitrogen). 
DLN tissues were then mounted with ProLong Gold mounting medium 
(Invitrogen) and analyzed with a laser-scanning confocal microscope 
(FluoView FV1000). Images were acquired with FluoView software, 
and GFP+
 cells were counted in the entire section and expressed as the 
mean number of GFP+
 cells/mm2
. In the FACS data, the histogram num￾bers represent the percentage of GFP+
 cells.
Lymph flow assessment using Evans blue dye
Ten micrograms of Evans blue dye (Sigma-Aldrich) in 10 μl of PBS was 
injected into the rectal mucosa of anesthetized untreated and treated 
mice subjected to the DSS protocol or WT and IL-10–KO treated ani￾mals (n = 5 mice per experimental group) using a Hamilton syringe. 
After 16 hours, mice were sacrificed, and Evans blue dye was extracted 
from distal colons of comparable weight by incubating the tissues at 
55°C overnight in formamide (Sigma-Aldrich). The background-sub￾tracted absorbance was measured with a Versamax microplate reader 
(Molecular Devices) at a wavelength of 620 to 740 nm. The concen￾tration of dye in the extracts was calculated from a standard curve of 
Evans blue in formamide and presented as the absolute amount of dye 
that remained in the colons.
Monitoring bacterial antigen clearance
Coating of beads with LPS. Carboxylated crimson fluorescent 1-μm 
beads (Molecular Probes) were coated with LPS from E. coli 0127:B8 
(Sigma-Aldrich), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. All 
steps were performed in glass tubes. LPS was dissolved at a concen￾tration of 2.5 mg/ml in 50 mM MES buffer (pH 6) and incubated for 
15 minutes at RT with 5 ml of a 2% aqueous suspension of microspheres. 
1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide was then added at a 
concentration of 5 mg/ml. Upon adjustment of the pH to 6.5 using 1 M 
NaOH, the solution was incubated for 2 hours at RT on a rocker. Coated 
beads were washed 3 times and resuspended in PBS with 1% BSA.
Intramucosal administration of LPS beads. Untreated and treated 
mice subjected to the DSS protocol or WT and IL-10–KO treated animals 
(n = 5 per experimental group) were intramucosally administered 50 μl 
LPS-coated bead or uncoated bead (not shown) solution containing 
3.6 × 109 beads using an insulin U-100/0.3 ml syringe (Terumo). Three 
days after injection, the animals were sacrificed, and the colons and 
DLNs were collected for analysis of both phenotype and migration 
patterns. For colons, tissues were cut and washed in HBSS buffer con￾taining 5% FCS, 20 mM HEPES, 100 Unit/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml 
streptomycin. DTT (1 mM) was then added for 2 minutes to remove 
mucous. Colons were cut in small pieces and incubated for 1 hour at 37°C 
in an enzymatic solution containing 120 Units of collagenase type II 
(Worthington), 5 mM CaCl2
 (VWR International), and 20–50 μg/ml 
DNAse I (Roche). Tissues were then filtered and washed in RPMI 
medium supplemented with 10% FCS and 20 mM HEPES. DLNs were 
smashed through a 70-μm filter (BD Falcon) with a 1-ml syringe plunger 
and washed with 10 ml RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FCS and 
20 mM HEPES. The uptake of beads by MΦs and DCs and the effects on 
their phenotype were analyzed by flow cytometry. For this purpose, cells 
were centrifuged and resuspended in PBS supplemented with 0.5% BSA 
and 0.005% NaN3
 (FACS buffer) and incubated for 30 minutes on ice 
with the following Abs: PE-conjugated anti-CD103 (clone M290;1:100; 
BD Pharmingen), PerCP-conjugated anti-CD45 (clone 30-F11; 1:100; 
37°C oven, and mounted in Eukitt Quick Hardening Mounting Media. 
Images were acquired with a VS120 Dot Slide System (Olympus), and 
BrdU-LYVE1+
 cells were counted in consecutive and randomly selected 
fields (n = 10 fields/section for each group) at the indicated time points 
shown in Figure 4 using VS-ASW software.
Morphometric and immunofluorescence intensity measurements
Morphometric analysis of colon whole mounts was performed by 3D 
visualization of LVs. Images were taken as a z series stack using a ×10 
objective and analyzed by Imaris Bitplane software, thus allowing 
visualization of the LVs in the submucosal and serosal-muscular lay￾ers. For each colon analyzed (n = 5–8 mice each experimental group), 
LV density and size were measured in 10 randomly chosen regions 
covered by vessels (each 1.0 mm2
 in area) and were represented as 
the average number of vessels per area (mm2
) and the mean value of 
diameters (μm), respectively.
The number of LYVE1–
, VEGFR3–
, or CD31+
 vessels in single- and 
double-stained human and murine colon tissues was established by 
stereological point counting of 10 regions per section (mucosal, sub￾mucosal, and serosal layers), each 1.5 mm2
 in area, using FluoView 
software (Olympus). Values are expressed as the mean number of 
positive vessels per mm2
.
Analysis of human and mouse VEGFR3 and LYVE1 double staining 
was performed as described by Tammela et al. (36), with slight modifi￾cations. In brief, murine colon sections were double stained with rabbit 
anti-LYVE1 (1:400; Abcam) and goat anti-VEGFR3 (1:50; R&D Sys￾tems) primary Abs, while staining of human colon sections is described 
above. Fluorescent images were acquired at a constant exposure time at 
×20 magnification on a laser-scanning confocal microscope (FluoView 
FV1000). Colons stained with secondary Abs alone were used to set the 
exposure time. Vascular structures with a lumen were analyzed with 
FluoView software, and all images were within a linear intensity range 
of 0 to 6,231. To exclude nonspecific staining, structures less than 8 μm 
(1 μm = 6.8 pixels) in diameter were excluded. To calculate mean ves￾sel intensity, the sums of pixel intensities per vessel were divided by the 
total vessel area (μm2
). The vessel mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) 
from 5 to 10 images per colon (n = 5–8 mice per experimental group) 
was averaged and compared between the treated and control groups.
Assay for inflammatory cell migration from the site 
of inflammation to the DLNs
GFP+
 mice were injected i.p. with 1 ml 3% thioglycolate (Sigma-Aldrich) 
in saline, and inflammatory cells were collected 3 days later by perito￾neal washing with ice-cold DMEM culture medium. Approximately 106
GFP+
 inflammatory cells in 10 μl PBS were adaptively transferred by 
injection into the noninflamed and inflamed rectal mucosa of untreated 
and treated mice subjected to the DSS protocol (at day 5 after the second 
DSS cycle) or into the noninflamed and inflamed rectal mucosa of WT 
and IL-10–KO treated animals (at day 21 after the first administration of 
Ad-hVEGF-C). Twelve hours later DLNs, including the mesenteric and 
lumbar LNs, were collected, frozen in Cryoblock Compound and sec￾tioned for immunofluorescence, and a cell suspension was obtained by 
smashing through a 70-μm filter (BD Falcon) with a 1-ml syringe plunger 
and washed with 10 ml RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FCS 
and 20 mM HEPES. Frozen sections of DLNs were fixed and blocked 
as described above and incubated with rabbit anti-LYVE1 primary 
Ab (1:400; Abcam) for 1 hour at RT. Sections were then incubated for

cated, and significant differences between the means were analyzed 
with a 2-tailed, unpaired Student’s t test. A P value of less than or equal 
to 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Adoptive transfer of VEGF-C–induced MΦs in colitic mice
BM-derived MΦs were flushed from the femurs and tibia of 7- to 
12-week-old GFP+ mice and treated as described in the Supplemen￾tal Information. Fully differentiated monocyte-derived MΦs were 
transfected with STAT6 or scramble siRNA (all from Santa Cruz 
Biotechnology Inc.) using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitro￾gen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Seventy-two 
hours after transfection, cells were either left untreated or were 
stimulated with VEGF-C (100 ng/ml; R&D Systems) or mF431C1 
(300 μg/ml; ImClone) for 24 hours. MΦs were then retrieved, and 
1.0 × 106 cells were injected into the rectal mucosa of anesthetized 
DSS-treated mice (n = 4–6/group) using an insulin U-100/0.3 ml 
syringe (Terumo), starting from day 4 and then every 4 days for the 
entire experiment. Clinical parameters such as body weight, DAI, 
and colon length were evaluated as described above.
