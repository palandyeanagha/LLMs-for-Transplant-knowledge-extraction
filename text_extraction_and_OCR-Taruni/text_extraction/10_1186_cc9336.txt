Abstract
Introduction: The identification of patients at highest risk for adverse outcome who are presenting with acute
dyspnea to the emergency department remains a challenge. This study investigates the prognostic value of
Copeptin, the C-terminal part of the vasopressin prohormone alone and combined to N-terminal pro B-type
natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) in patients with acute dyspnea.
Methods: We conducted a prospective, observational cohort study in the emergency department of a university
hospital and enrolled 287 patients with acute dyspnea.
Results: Copeptin levels were elevated in non-survivors (n = 29) compared to survivors at 30 days (108 pmol/l,
interquartile range (IQR) 37 to 197 pmol/l) vs. 18 pmol/l, IQR 7 to 43 pmol/l; P < 0.0001). The areas under the
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) to predict 30-day mortality were 0.83 (95% confidence interval (CI)
0.76 to 0.90), 0.76 (95% CI 0.67 to 0.84) and 0.63 (95% CI 0.53 to 0.74) for Copeptin, NT-proBNP and BNP,
respectively (Copeptin vs. NTproBNP P = 0.21; Copeptin vs. BNP P = 0.002). When adjusted for common
cardiovascular risk factors and NT-proBNP, Copeptin was the strongest independent predictor for short-term
mortality in all patients (HR 3.88 (1.94 to 7.77); P < 0.001) and especially in patients with acute decompensated
heart failure (ADHF) (HR 5.99 (2.55 to 14.07); P < 0.0001). With the inclusion of Copeptin to the adjusted model
including NTproBNP, the net reclassification improvement (NRI) was 0.37 (P < 0.001). An additional 30% of those
who experienced events were reclassified as high risk, and an additional 26% without events were reclassified as
low risk.
Conclusions: Copeptin is a new promising prognostic marker for short-term mortality independently and additive
to natriuretic peptide levels in patients with acute dyspnea.
Introduction
Acute dyspnea is a frequent clinical presentation in the
emergency department (ED). Cardiac and pulmonary
disorders account for more than 75% of patients pre￾senting with acute dyspnea to the ED [1,2]. The identifi￾cation of acute dyspneic patients at highest risk for
death, particularly regarding short-term mortality
remains a challenge. Patient history and physical exami￾nation remain the cornerstone of clinical evaluation [3],
while disease specific scoring tools [4,5] and biomarkers
such as natriuretic peptides have been introduced to
assist the clinician in the diagnostic and prognostic
assessment [6-10].
The arginin-vasopressin system plays a crucial role in the
regulation of the individual endogenous stress response
[11]. Levels of arginin-vasopressin have been shown to be
elevated in heart failure [12] and in different states of
shock [13], but investigation of the vasopressin system was
limited so far due to the fact that vasopressin is unstable
(half-life 5 to 15 minutes) and largely attached to platelets
[14,15]. Copeptin, the c-terminal part of the vasopressin
prohormone, is secreted stoichiometrically with vasopres￾sin from the neurohypophysis and is much more stable,
thus overcoming the limitations and difficulties assessing

the arginin-vasopressin-system [16]. Recently, several stu￾dies investigated the prognostic role of Copeptin in various
diseases [17-23], but little is known about the prognostic
value of Copeptin in a typical ED population, for example,
the patient group admitted with acute dyspnea. In clinical
practice, the identification of dyspneic patients at highest
risk for adverse outcome remains challenging. Therefore,
we tested the prognostic value of Copeptin together with
established markers such as BNP and NT-proBNP in an
effort to better understand the role of Copeptin in this
setting.
Materials and methods
Study population
The study population consisted of unselected patients
presenting to the emergency department of the Univer￾sity Hospital of Basel, Switzerland, with a chief com￾plaint of acute dyspnea. From April 2006 to March
2007, 292 patients (out of 327 patients screened) were
prospectively enrolled. Exclusion criteria were age
younger than 18 years, an obvious traumatic cause of
dyspnea and patients on haemodialysis. 287 of the 292
patients had complete copeptin data at presentation and
were considered as the study population. The study was
carried out according to the principles of the Declara￾tion of Helsinki and approved by the local ethics com￾mittee. Written informed consent was obtained from all
participating patients.
Clinical evaluation and follow-up
Patients underwent an initial clinical assessment includ￾ing clinical history, physical examination, electrocardio￾gram, pulse oximetry, blood tests including BNP, and
chest X-ray. Echocardiography, pulmonary function tests
and other diagnostic tests like CT-angiography were
performed according to the treating physician. CT￾angiography was the imaging modality of choice in
patients with suspected pulmonary embolism. To assess
the dyspnea severity we used the NYHA (New York
Heart Association) classification with NYHA II as ‘dys￾pnea while walking up a slight incline’, III as ‘dyspnea
while walking on level ground’ and IV as ‘dyspnea at
rest’.
Two independent internists blinded to Copeptin
reviewed all medical records including BNP levels and
independently classified the patient’s primary diagnosis
into seven categories: acute decompensated heart failure
(ADHF), acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pul￾monary disease, pneumonia, acute complications of
malignancy, acute pulmonary embolism, hyperventila￾tion, and others. In the event of diagnostic disagreement
among the internist reviewers, they were asked to meet
to come to a common conclusion. In the event that
they were unable to come to a common conclusion, a
third-party internist adjudicator was asked to review the
data and determine which diagnosis was the most
accurate.
The endpoint of the present study was defined as 30-
day all-cause mortality. Each patient was contacted for
follow-up, via telephone, by a single trained researcher
after 30 days. Regarding mortality data, referring physi￾cians were contacted or the administrative databases of
respective hometowns were reviewed, if necessary. Of
note, one patient was lost to follow-up, so mortality
analyses were performed in 286 patients.
Laboratory measurements
Blood samples for determination of Copeptin, BNP and
NT-proBNP were collected at presentation into tubes
containing potassium EDTA. After centrifugation, sam￾ples were frozen at -80°C until assayed in a blinded
fashion in a single batch using a novel commercial sand￾wich immunoluminometric assay (B.R.A.H.M.S LUMIt￾est CT-proAVP, BRAHMS AG, Hennigsdorf/Berlin,
Germany) as described in detail elsewhere [16]. Since
this initial publication, the assay was modified as fol￾lows: The capture antibody was replaced by a murine
monoclonal antibody directed to amino acids 137 to 144
(GPAGAL) of pro-Arginin-Vasopressin. This modifica￾tion improved the sensitivity of the assay. The lower
detection limit was 0.4 pmol/L and the functional assay
sensitivity (< 20% inter assay CV) was <1 pmol/L. Med￾ian Copeptin levels in 200 healthy individuals was 3.7
pmol/l and the 97.5th percentile was 16.4 pmol/L. NT￾proBNP levels were determined in a blinded fashion by
a quantitative electrochemiluminescence immunoassay
with CVs claimed by the manufacturer were 1.8% to
2.7% and 2.35% to 3.2% for within-run and total impre￾cision, respectively (Elecsys proBNP, Roche Diagnostics
AG, Zug, Switzerland) [24] and BNP was measured by a
microparticle enzyme immunoassay at the hospital
laboratory with a CVs claimed by the manufacturer of
4.3% to 6.3% and 6.5% to 9.4% for within-run and total
imprecision, respectively. (AxSym, Abbott Laboratories,
Abbott Park, IL, USA) [25].
Statistical analysis
Continuous variables are presented as mean ±SD or
median (with interquartile range), and categorical vari￾ables as numbers and percentages. Univariate data on
demographic and clinical features were compared by
Mann-Whitney U-test or Fisher’s exact test as appropri￾ate. Correlations among continuous variables were
assessed by the Spearman rank-correlation coefficient.
Plasma levels of Copeptin, NT-proBNP and BNP were
log-transformed to achieve a normal distribution. Thus,
hazard ratios refer to a 10-fold rise in the levels of these
markers. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves

were utilized to evaluate the accuracy of Copeptin, NT￾proBNP and BNP to predict death. Areas under the curve
(AUCs) were calculated for all markers. AUCs were com￾pared according to the method by Hanley and McNeil
[26]. We calculated the Net reclassification improvement
(NRI) per Pencina et al. [27]. This index sums up the dif￾ference in proportions of patients that are reclassified to a
higher or lower risk group predicted in terms of their
actual outcome by adding Copeptin to the existing model
with NT-proBNP and confounders. Cox regression analy￾sis was assessed by univariate and multivariate analysis to
identify independent predictors of outcome. In multivari￾ate analysis, each of the three biomarkers (BNP, NT￾proBNP and Copeptin) was included to the adjusted
model including age, gender, a history of heart failure, glo￾merular filtration rate, diabetes and systolic blood pres￾sure. In the next step, NT-proBNP or Copeptin was added
to the adjusted model as dependent variable to examine
the independent value of each biomarker. The Kaplan￾Meier cumulative survival curves were compared by the
log-rank test. Glomerular filtration rate was calculated
using the abbreviated Modification of Diet in Renal Dis￾ease (MDRD) formula. Data were statistically analysed
with SPSS 15.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and
the MedCalc 9.3.9.0 package (MedCalc Software, Maria￾kerke, Belgium). All probabilities were two tailed and P <
0.05 was regarded as significant.
Results
Patient characteristics
The baseline characteristics of the 287 patients present￾ing with acute dyspnea are described in Table 1. Overall,
mean age was 74 ± 12 years (median 77 years, inter￾quartile range (IQR) 68 to 83 years), 52% were men and
80% were in NYHA functional class III and IV. The pri￾mary diagnosis was ADHF in 154 (54%) patients, acute
exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
in 57 (20%) patients, pneumonia in 32 (11%) patients,
acute pulmonary embolism in 8 (3%) patients, acute
complications of malignancy in 7 (2%) patients, hyper￾ventilation in 5 (2%) patients, and other causes such as
interstitial lung disease, asthma, or bronchitis in 24 (8%)
patients. Differences between patients with ADHF ver￾sus patients without ADHF are depicted in Table 1.
Copeptin levels and prognostic value of Copeptin on
short-term outcome
The median Copeptin concentration was 21 pmol/l
(IQR 8 to 52 pmol/l) in all patients. Concentrations of
Copeptin were significantly higher in those dyspneic
patients with ADHF versus those without (34 pmol/l,
IQR 13 to 71 pmol/l vs.11 pmol/l, IQR 6 to 31 pmol/l;
P < 0.0001). There was only a modest correlation
between concentrations of log-transformed Copeptin
and BNP (r = 0.42, P < 0.001) or NT-proBNP (r = 0.53,
P < 0.001).
At 30 days, 29 patients (10.1%) had died. Non-survivors
had significantly higher Copeptin levels than survivors
(108 pmol/l, IQR 37 to 197 pmol/l) vs. 18 pmol/l, IQR 7
to 43 pmol/l; P < 0.0001). Among those subjects with
ADHF, non-survivors (n = 21) had higher Copeptin levels
than survivors (n = 133) (140 pmol/l, IQR 60 to 236
pmol/l vs. 28 pmol/l, IQR 11 to 55 pmol/l; P < 0.0001)
and also in patients without ADHF the levels of Copeptin
were higher in non-survivors (n = 8) than in survivors
(n = 125) (61 pmol/l, IQR 18 to 112 pmol/l vs. 10 pmol/l,
IQR 6 to 30 pmol/l; P = 0.007; Figure 1).
In Figure 2 the AUC to predict mortality are illu￾strated for Copeptin, NT-proBNP and BNP. The ROC
analyses demonstrated an AUC of 0.83 (95% confidence
interval (CI) 0.76 to 0.90) for Copeptin to predict
30-day mortality, with an optimal cut-point of 59 pmol/
l. NT-proBNP had an AUC of 0.76 (95% CI 0.67 to
0.84) and BNP of 0.63 (95% CI 0.53 to 0.74) for 30-day
mortality. Copeptin had a significantly higher AUC
compared with BNP (P = 0.002) but not compared to
NT-proBNP (P = 0.21). In patients with ADHF the
AUC were 0.84 (95% CI 0.76 to 0.92) for Copeptin, 0.72
(95% CI 0.59 to 0.84) for NT-proBNP and 0.55 (95% CI
0.40 to 0.69) for BNP (Copeptin vs. NT-proBNP P =
0.098; Copeptin vs. BNP P < 0.001).
Kaplan-Meier curves showed that patients in the high￾est quartile (Q4) had a significantly increased mortality
compared with the other quartiles (Q1 to Q3) (Q1 =
1.2%, Q2 = 3.2%, Q3 = 6.8%, Q4 = 30%; P < 0.0001)
(Figure 3). This pattern of increased mortality according
to quartiles remained true for patients with ADHF but
not for patients without ADHF (P < 0.0001 and P =
0.121, respectively). Patients in the highest quartile more
often required admission to the hospital (99% vs. 83% in
Q1 to Q3; P < 0.001), more often required admission to
the intensive care unit (ICU) (16% vs. 6% Q1 to Q3, P =
0.011) and had higher in-hospital mortality (19% vs. 3%
in Q1 to Q3, P < 0.0001).
Univariate Cox regression analysis showed that plasma
levels of Copeptin, NT-proBNP, glomerular filtration
rate and systolic blood pressure were predictors of 30-
day mortality in all patients, regardless of whether they
had ADHF or not. Copeptin was the strongest predictor
of mortality in all patients (HR 5.28, 95% CI 3.08 to
9.06, P < 0.0001) and in patients with ADHF (HR 5.36,
95% CI 2.82 to 10.19, P < 0.001). BNP showed only a
limited prognostic value in all patients and no value in
the subgroups (Table 2).

(age, gender, history of heart failure, glomerular filtra￾tion rate, diabetes, systolic blood pressure). Copeptin
remained the strongest independent predictor for 30-
day mortality in all patients (HR 4.58, 95% CI 2.29 to
9.13; P < 0.001), especially in a patient with ADHF (HR
6.51, 95% CI 2.83 to 14.95; P < 0.0001). Even when NT￾proBNP was included in this model, Copeptin kept its
prognostic value in all patients (HR 3.88, 95% CI 1.94 to
7.77; P = 0.0001) and even more in patients with ADHF
(HR 5.99, 95% CI 2.55 to 14.07; P < 0.0001). NT￾proBNP was not significantly associated with mortality
in patients with ADHF after including Copeptin in the
model (HR 2.78, 95% CI 0.78 to 10.60; P = 0.11). The
addition of Copeptin to the adjusted model including
NT-proBNP resulted in reclassification of 37% of the
patients. The NRI for events was 0.21 and the NRI for
non-events was 0.16, achieving an NRI for the entire
study cohort of 0.37 at 30 days (P < 0.001). Overall, 13

patients (30%) of those who experienced events were
reclassified as high risk, and an additional 64 patients
(26%) without events were reclassified as low risk.
Combined prognostic value of Copeptin and NT-proBNP
Mortality rates in all dyspneic patients as a function of
Copeptin and NT-proBNP concentrations were examined
and showed in Figure 4. Those with low Copeptin concen￾trations (lowest three quartiles) had lower rates of death in
the first 30 days, irrespective of NT-proBNP concentra￾tion. Those patients with elevations (highest quartile) in
both, Copeptin and NT-proBNP had the highest rates of
death (15 out of 37 patients, 40.5%) at 30 days. Consider￾ing those patients with ADHF, similar to the group as a
whole, the same relationship between Copeptin, NT￾proBNP and outcome was observed. Those patients with
low rates of Copeptin had low rates of death, irrespective
of NT-proBNP levels at 30 days. In those patients with an
elevation of both, Copeptin and NT-proBNP, the mortality
rate was 42.9%, with 12 deaths out of 28 patients at
30 days.
Discussion
The early risk stratification of patients with acute dys￾pnea admitted to the ED is an unmet clinical need to
improve the patient care in the first days of hospitalisa￾tion. Therefore, we investigated the role of Copeptin to
predict short-term mortality in patients presenting with
acute dyspnea to the ED. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first study analysing Copeptin plasma levels
and their additive value to natriuretic peptides in a
broader patient population like the typical ED popula￾tion admitted with acute dyspnea.
We report five major findings. First, Copeptin levels
were significantly higher in patients with ADHF than in
patients with other diagnoses responsible for acute

dyspnea. Second, Copeptin was significantly higher in
non-survivors compared to survivors at 30 days, regard￾less of whether ADHF was present or not. Third, Copep￾tin is a new promising prognostic marker for short-term
mortality independent of natriuretic peptide levels in
patients with acute dyspnea and even more in patients
with ADHF. Fourth, patients in the highest quartile of
Copeptin levels had the highest mortality rate. Fifth, and

of most importance, because both Copeptin and NT￾proBNP were independent predictors of death, we also
showed that the elevation of both markers was associated
with the highest rates of death at 30 days in the entire
patient cohort as well as in patients with ADHF. Further￾more, patients with low Copeptin levels had an excellent
short-term prognosis even if NT-proBNP levels were
high. These findings have major clinical implications. In
clinical practice, the identification of dyspneic patients at
highest risk for adverse outcomes remains difficult and
largely depends on the underlying cause. Adding to this
complexity is the fact that acute dyspnea is often due to
multiple reasons like cardiac, pulmonary or inflammatory
causes. Specific markers of the cardiovascular system like
natriuretic peptides may therefore not be ideal to predict
the outcome of patients with acute dyspnea in the ED.
Katan et al. showed in a small study that Copeptin is
a good marker of the individual stress level comparing
three groups of patients with increasing stress levels
(healthy controls without apparent stress, hospitalized
medical patients with moderate stress and surgical
patients 30 minutes after extubation, with maximal
stress) [28]. Taking this into account, it seems reason￾able that patients with acute dyspnea and apparently in
a stress situation could have higher Copeptin levels.
Recent studies by our group and others have suggested
Copeptin and, therefore, the vasopressin system to be
major determinants of outcome in patients where dyspnea
is often the major symptom such as in acute myocardial
infarction, in chronic heart failure and even in patients
with community-acquired pneumonia and exacerbated
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [17-22,29].
Copeptin release in acutely dyspneic patients is most
likely related to three possible mechanisms. First,
vasopressin release in heart failure is mainly driven by
arterial underfilling caused by cardiac output failure,
which activates the baroreceptors in the carotid sinus and
the aortic arch. Volume overload and hyponatremia
might also stimulate the release of vasopressin [30,31].
Second, vasopressin has been shown to have vasocon￾strictive effects, which may correlate to the hypoxia
induced-vasoconstriction in severe chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease [32,33]. Increased concentrations of
vasopressin may compensate for vasopressin (V1) recep￾tor down-regulation following exposure to sustained
hypoxemia [34]. Third, Copeptin is significantly increased
in bacterial infection and febrile conditions [13,35]. In the
present study, the main causes of acute dyspnea were
ADHF (54%), acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (20%) and pneumonia (11%). There￾fore, the above mentioned mechanisms of Copeptin
release reflect the broad spectrum of our acutely dyspneic
patients and our findings corroborate that Copeptin may
be a new promising candidate for the prediction of short￾term mortality in this patient population. One could
argue that Copeptin is another unspecific marker of
inflammation. We, therefore, also compared the prognos￾tic value of Copeptin with CRP and found that Copeptin
was superior to CRP, an established inflammatory and
also prognostic marker (AUC 0.83 (95% CI 0.76 to 0.90)
vs. 0.71 (0.63 to 0.80), P = 0.04). Further studies should
investigate whether Copeptin might help physicians tailor
the therapy in view of the relative risk and allocate
resources accordingly and whether this risk-stratification
guided strategy might affect outcome. Additionally, it
should be investigated whether serial copeptin testing
further improves the risk stratification of acute dyspneic
patients.

There are several limitations to our study. First, data
derived from a single-centre study always need to be
replicated in larger multicentre studies. However, our
cohort is representative because patient characteristics
are comparable to multicentre studies of acute dyspnea
[1,36]. Second, we assessed all-cause mortality because
classification of death in clinical practice can sometimes
be difficult and unreliable [37]. However, exact numbers
of all different causes of death could have provided
more interesting insights into the pathophysiological
role of the biomarkers. And finally, the diagnosis of
ADHF remains challenging even with the use of BNP
and the diagnostic classification was possibly not 100%
accurate. It is possible that some patients have had
latent or mild heart failure, even though they were clas￾sified in the ‘no ADHF’-group because other informa￾tion (for example, a history of chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, pulmonary infiltrates on chest x-ray)
may have suggested that the diagnosis was not ADHF.
However, our classification was obtained by experienced
physicians, suggesting that our results are valid.
Conclusions
Our study suggests that Copeptin alone or combined
with NT-proBNP has a potential to assist clinicians in
risk stratifying patients presenting with acute dyspnea
regarding short-term mortality.
Key messages
• In patients with acute dyspnea, Copeptin levels are
elevated in non-survivors compared to survivors.
• Copeptin is a new promising prognostic marker for
short-term mortality independently of natriuretic
peptide levels.
• The elevation of both Copeptin and NT-proBNP
was associated with the highest rates of death at 30
days.
• Patients with low Copeptin levels had an excellent
short-term prognosis even if NT-proBNP levels were
high.
