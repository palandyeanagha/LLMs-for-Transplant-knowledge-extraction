Abstract
Invariant NKT (iNKT) cells can be activated to stimulate a broad inflammatory response. In
murine models of sickle cell disease (SCD), interruption of iNKT cell activity prevents tissue
injury from vaso-occlusion. NKTT120 is an anti-iNKT cell monoclonal antibody that has the
potential to rapidly and specifically deplete iNKT cells and, potentially, prevent vaso-occlu￾sion. We conducted an open-label, multi-center, single-ascending-dose study of NKTT120
to determine its pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and safety in steady-state patients
with SCD. Doses were escalated in a 3+3 study design over a range from 0.001 mg/kg to
1.0 mg/kg. Twenty-one adults with SCD were administered NKTT120 as part of 7 dose
cohorts. Plasma levels of NKTT120 predictably increased with higher doses. Median half￾life of NKTT120 was 263 hours. All subjects in the higher dose cohorts (0.1 mg/kg, 0.3 mg/
kg, and 1 mg/kg) demonstrated decreased iNKT cells below the lower limit of quantification
within 6 hours after infusion, the earliest time point at which they were measured. In those
subjects who received the two highest doses of NKTT120 (0.3, 1 mg/kg), iNKT cells were
not detectable in the peripheral blood for a range of 2 to 5 months. There were no serious
adverse events in the study deemed to be related to NKTT120. In adults with SCD,
NKTT120 produced rapid, specific and sustained iNKT cell depletion without any infusional
toxicity or attributed serious adverse events. The next step is a trial to determine NKTT120’s
ability to decrease rate of vaso-occlusive pain episodes.

Introduction
Vaso-occlusion (VO) of post-capillary venules is the predominant cause of morbidity and
mortality for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) [1]. More than just the occlusion of sickle
erythrocytes, VO involves multi-cellular interactions between leukocytes, platelets, endothelial
cells, as well as normal and sickle-shaped erythrocytes [2]. Pro-inflammatory cytokines pro￾mote these interactions through activation of vascular endothelium and leukocytes, along with
the recruitment of additional cells to the site of VO [3]. Invariant NKT (iNKT) cells, a cell type
known to produce significant amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines, may be of particular
importance in the pathogenesis of VO [3].
Resident in the peripheral blood as well as many organs (liver, spleen, lymph nodes, omen￾tum, lung, eye and kidney), iNKT cells are a unique subset of lymphocytes with characteristics
of innate and adaptive immunity [4]. Similar to cells of the adaptive immune system, such as
conventional T cells, iNKT cells are activated by T cell receptor (TCR) engagement of antigens
displayed on antigen presenting cells (APCs). Unlike conventional T cells, which express a
broad TCR repertoire and recognize specific pathogenic proteins, the TCR of iNKT cells is
invariant (Vα24Jα18Vβ11) and recognizes the non-specific pattern of glycolipids presented
by CD1d, an MHC class 1-like molecule expressed on antigen presenting cells [5]. Although
these glycolipids may be derived from microbes, in the pathogenesis of SCD they are likely
endogenous [6]. One mechanism is thought to involve danger-associated molecular patterns
(DAMPs), which may be generated during VO and can activate toll-like receptors on APCs to
synthesize and present glycolipids to iNKT cells [6]. Another potential mechanism of iNKT
cell activation in SCD is through interactions between secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2), a
lipid elevated in the plasma of patients with SCD, and phosphotidylserine (PS), a lipid abnor￾mally exposed on the outer membrane of sickle erythrocytes [7]. Elevated sPLA2 in the plasma
of patients with SCD may localize to PS on sickle erythrocytes and generate iNKT cell-activat￾ing phospholipids [8–11]. Regardless of the mechanism, once activated, iNKT cells promptly
secrete cytokines (interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), interleukin-4 (IL-4) and others) that can activate
downstream effector cells and vascular endothelium as well as proteolytic enzymes, such as
perforin and granzymes, which can produce tissue injury [12]. This rapid, non-specific activa￾tion, akin to the activation of innate immune cells, enables iNKT cells to instigate and sustain a
broad inflammatory response that is characteristic of SCD and critical to pathogenesis of VO.
Evidence for a role of iNKT cells in VO comes from mice and patients with SCD, both of
which demonstrate a higher percentage of activated iNKT cells in the tissues or peripheral
blood compared to controls [13]. In mice, an accumulation of iNKT cells has also been
observed in target organs, particularly the lung, with further increases noted after VO. Inter￾ruption of iNKT cell activity in mouse models of SCD with an anti-CD1d antibody, an anti￾iNKT cell monoclonal antibody, or an adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR) agonist prevents VO￾induced lung inflammation and injury [13–16]. Based on these preliminary data, we per￾formed a phase 1 study of the A2AR agonist, regadenoson, in 27 adults with SCD. Regadeno￾son, administered as a 24-hour infusion during VO, was shown to decrease iNKT cell activity
by 50% [17]. A phase 2 randomized-controlled trial of regadenoson to determine its efficacy
for the treatment of a VO crisis is underway [3]. There are limitations, however, to the regade￾noson approach. First, regadenoson’s short half-life necessitates an infusion to treat an acute
VO event, which is far less optimal than the prevention of one. Second, regadenoson was only
shown to decrease iNKT activity by 50%. The iNKT cell activity that remains may still contrib￾ute to VO.

[18]. Prior to a phase 2/3 clinical trial of this promising agent, we conducted a study to deter￾mine its pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and safety. Our objective was to identify an
appropriate dose of NKTT120 that safely depletes iNKT cells for 3–6 months. The ultimate
goal of iNKT cell depletion would be a reduction in the systemic inflammatory state that is
characteristic of SCD in order to prevent or decrease the severity of VO and, ultimately, pre￾serve organ function.
Materials and methods
This study was approved by the Human Research Protection Program at Medical College of
Wisconsin, the Human Research Protection Office at Washington University in St. Louis, the
IRB and the Office of Human Research Ethics at the University of North Carolina, and the
Institutional Review Board at Oakland Children’s Hospital. Written consent was obtained
from all subjects prior to participation and all study activities were performed according to the
principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki. The study was registered on clinicaltrials.
gov (NCT01783691).
Eligibility
Eligible subjects were adults, aged 18 to 60 years, with HbSS/HbSβ-thalassemia0
, who were at
steady-state in the month prior to enrollment without pain events, transfusions, changes in
medications or evidence of active infection. All subjects were required to be up to date with
CDC-recommended immunizations for asplenic patients. Key exclusion criteria included
chronic transfusion therapy, >10 hospital admissions for pain in the year prior to enrollment,
asthma, pregnant or nursing, and a history of stem cell transplant. After enrollment, two iNKT
cell measurements were obtained (at -4 and -2 weeks) to ensure that subjects had detectable
iNKT cell levels before dosing. In order to be eligible, both measurements were required to be
above the lower level of quantification (LLOQ).
Study design
In this study, steady-state adult subjects with SCD were intravenously dosed with NKTT120
over ten minutes without premedication. Doses were escalated in over a range of 0.001 mg/kg
to 1.0 mg/kg (0.001, 0.003, 0.01, 0.03, 0.10, 0.3, 1.0), based on estimates from prior studies of
NKTT120 in cynomolgus monkeys, using a 3+3 design [18]. A 3+3 design examines 3 subjects
per dose cohort, sequentially. If none experience a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), the dose is
considered safe and dose escalation may occur. If 1/3 subjects experiences DLT, 3 additional
subjects are examined, and, if more than 1 subject experiences a DLT, further dose escalation
is not pursued. The highest dose with  1 subject experiencing a DLT was defined as the maxi￾mum tolerated dose (MTD). Doses were increased until a MTD, or a dose that depleted iNKT
cells for 3 to 6 months, was reached. The latter would then be the recommended dose level
(RDL) for the phase 2 trial. Notably, in the initial study design, there were 5 doses (0.001–0.10
mg/kg). However, since the MTD was not achieved at 0.10 mg/kg, and some subjects recov￾ered iNKT cell prior to 30 days after dosing, two additional dose cohorts were added (0.30 and
1.0 mg/kg). Subjects were monitored for 6 hours post-infusion and safety laboratory tests were
obtained at 6 hours, day +1, day +2, day +7, day +14 and then monthly. Physical examination
was performed on day +7, day +14 and then monthly. All subjects were followed for at least 2
weeks or until iNKT cells were detectable in circulation.

Laboratory methods
Blood samples were collected for safety labs (CBC, reticulocyte count, chemistries, hepatic
function), as well as pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses, which, in addition to
iNKT cell measurement, included an assessment of B and T cells by FACS. Pharmacokinetic
samples were stored as serum and frozen at -70˚C prior to analysis.
Pharmacokinetic assay
Pharmacokinetic analyses were performed with a validated capture assay at MPI Research
(Mattawan, MI). A rabbit polyclonal anti-NKTT120 IgG was used as both the capture and
detection antibody; the detection antibody was also labelled with biotin. Dilutions were then
performed to generate a calibration curve after which optical density was measured at 450 nm.
Data was analyzed with SOFTmax Pro GxP Version 5.3 (Molecular Devices, Inc, Sunnyvale,
California), Watson LIMS Version 7.4 (Thermo Scientific, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) and
ExyLIMS Version 3.0 (MPI Research, Mattawan, Michigan).
FACS analyses. FACS analyses were performed at the BloodCenter of Wisconsin (Mil￾waukee, WI). Red blood cells were lysed and analyzed as two panels on a FACSCanto™, which
is capable of analyzing 6 colors. The first panel differentiated NK cells, B cells, and T cells
and identified CD4+/CD8+ positive subsets with the antibodies: CD3-PE.Cy7, CD20-APC,
CD56-PE, CD4-PerCPCy5.5, and CD8-FITC. The second panel identified iNKT cells and acti￾vated subsets with the antibodies: CD3-PE.Cy7, CD20-APC, CD4-PerCPCy5.5, CD69-APC.
Cy7, Vα24-PE, and Vβ11-FITC. Controls were also run with the antibodies: CD3-PE.Cy7,
CD20-APC, CD4-PerCPCy5.5, IgG-APC.Cy7, Va24-PE, and Vb11-FITC, and were used to
determine CD69 cutoff. A minimum of 200,000 CD3+ events were acquired. The limit of sen￾sitivity for iNKT cell detection was 0.01% of CD3+ T cells. See S1 Fig for gating strategy.
Outcome measures
Pharmacokinetics. Pharmacokinetics of NKTT120 was determined by plasma measure￾ments of NKTT120 pre- and post-dose at 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 3 hours, 6 hours,
day +1, day +2, day +3, day +7, day +14, and at each monthly visit.
Pharmacodynamics. iNKT cell depletion and recovery was assessed after dosing with
NKTT120 at 6 hours, day +1, day +2, day +7, day +14, and at each monthly visit. Recovery was
defined as return at or above the LLOQ of 0.01%.
Safety. Adverse events of interest were defined as: 1) any adverse event that occurred
within 2 weeks of dosing with the exception of VO pain episodes, 2) any adverse event grade 3
or higher on NCI CTCAE version 4.03, especially study-specific events: cytopenias, infections
and cytokine storm, 3) sickle cell-specific adverse events (hemolysis, VOC within 6 hours or
increased pain within 72 hours of dose). All events of interest were considered potential DLTs
and were reviewed by a scientific review committee that determined attribution of the event to
NKTT120. A DLT was an event of interest attributed to NKTT120.
Data analysis
Sample size. Sample size was determined by the 3+3 study design and the number of
dose-level cohorts (up to 5 to 6 cohorts were initially planned; when MTD was not reached,
additional cohorts were added). Between 2 and 30 subjects were expected to be dosed in the
trial, with 3 to 6 subjects per cohort. In addition, a dose-level cohort that represented the MTD
was to be expanded to 6 subjects to confirm MTD.

Analysis of outcomes
Descriptive statistics of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data was provided. Differ￾ences between lower and upper dose cohorts of NKTT120 was measured with Chi-Square or
Fisher’s exact tests for categorical variables and Student’s t or Mann-Whitney U tests for con￾tinuous variables that were normally or non-normally distributed, respectively. When appro￾priate, non-normally distributed variables were log transformed. Spearman’s correlation was
used to determine the relationship between baseline iNKT cell values. Mann-Whitney U test
was used to compare iNKT cell number between those with and without hydroxyurea.
Results
Subjects
A total of 21 subjects were enrolled into 7 cohorts ranging in dose levels between 0.001 mg/kg
and 1.0 mg/kg (Fig 1, Table 1). Approximately half (n = 11) of the subjects had a history of
acute chest syndrome and fewer had the co-morbid conditions of stroke, avascular necrosis,
gall bladder disease or splenic sequestration. Fourteen of the subjects (67%) were treated with
hydroxyurea and 13 subjects (62%) had reported one or more VO pain episode that required
contact with a medical facility in the 12 months prior to study start.
When the recent histories of those in the lower dose cohorts were compared to those in the
higher dose cohorts, there were significantly higher white blood cell and reticulocyte counts in
the subjects assigned the higher dose cohort (Table 1). There were also more pain episodes in
the past year in the higher dose cohorts compared to the lower dose cohorts, as well as a higher
prevalence of avascular necrosis and cumulative number of morbidities (these did not achieve
statistical significance). Although hydroxyurea use was not statistically different between those
in the lower and higher dose cohorts, its use was not equally distributed across dose cohorts.
All subjects in dose cohorts 1, 3, 4, and 6 were prescribed hydroxyurea, as opposed to 1 of 3

subjects in dose cohort 2 and 7, and no subjects in dose cohort 5. The small numbers in each
dose cohort make it difficult to determine the effect of hydroxyurea, if any, on iNKT cell recov￾ery after dosing.
Pharmacokinetics
After a single intravenous dose of NKTT120, the maximum plasma concentration and area
under the curve increased in a dose-proportional manner (Fig 2). NKTT120 was eliminated
from serum in a biphasic manner, with a relatively short distribution phase (about 3 days) and
median terminal half-lives of 263 hours (range: 98–386 hours).
Pharmacodynamics
In the two pre-drug measures, iNKT cell levels within a subject were highly correlated (r = 0.9,
P<0.01). Pre-drug iNKT cell numbers were not affected by hydroxyurea use (median pre-drug
iNKT cell number for those who used hydroxurea was 0.05% T cells compared to 0.045% T
cells for those who did not, P = 0.3). After a dose of NKTT120, all subjects’ iNKT cell levels
decreased, although the degree and duration of the decrease varied with the dose administered
(Fig 3A). Subjects with higher baseline iNKT cell levels were less likely to deplete iNKT cells
after a given dose, especially in lower dose cohorts, and experienced re-appearance of iNKT
cells in the peripheral blood occurred more quickly (Fig 3B).

In each of the 4 lower dose cohorts (0.001 mg/kg to 0.03 mg/kg), 2 of 3 subjects’ iNKT cell
values dropped below LLOQ within 6 hours. Of these subjects who dropped below LLOQ,
iNKT cell recovery varied from 1 day to 2 months. All subjects in dose cohort 5 (0.1 mg/kg), 6
(0.3 mg/kg) and 7 (1 mg/kg) decreased iNKT cells below LLOQ within 6 hours (Fig 3A). One
subject in dose cohort 5, however, rose above the LLOQ by day 7. The longest time to iNKT
cell recovery above LLOQ was a subject in dose cohort 5 who required 5 months. In dose
cohort 6, 2 subjects rose above the LLOQ by month 2, with the third rising briefly to the mini￾mum detectable level at month 4, but then returned below LLOQ from months 5 through 8.
Of note, although iNKT cells returned at the LLOQ in month 4, the investigators elected to
continue with monthly iNKT cell measurements in the subject since their values were border￾line detectable and their re-appearance was later than others in the study (up to that point). In
dose cohort 7, subjects recovered at 2, 4 and 5 months after NKTT120 administration.
After recovery of iNKT cells in the peripheral blood, subjects were followed for 1 additional
month. At the end-of-study measurement, it was notable that subjects with high starting levels
of iNKT cells (>0.03%) usually did not recover to their baseline levels. This suggests that for
patients with higher starting levels of iNKT cells more complete depletion may be achieved
with subsequent doses.
No evidence was seen for the theoretical concern that NKTT120 could activate iNKT cells.
Post-dose cytokine measurements were generally low and showed no indication of iNKT cell
activation. There was also no indication of significantly increased iNKT cell activity after
recovery. Of the 7 dose cohorts, only 2 subjects from dose cohort 3 and those in dose cohort 5
showed an increase in the percent of CD69+-activated iNKT cells when end-of-study samples
were compared to pre-drug samples. These differences were not statistically significant. There
were no changes in T or B cell percentages by FACS analysis after treatment with NKTT120 at
any dose (data not shown).
Safety
Subjects were followed for at least 2 weeks after iNKT cell recovery (minimum 2 weeks, maxi￾mum 8 months). No DLTs were experienced in 21 subjects. Seventeen subjects (81%) experi￾enced a total of 69 AEs, of which 57 (83%) were grade 1 or 2 (S1 Table). The most frequently

reported was VOC and fatigue. Seven subjects (33%) had treatment-related AEs, but none were
grade 3 or higher. An increased occurrence of AEs, including treatment-related AEs, was seen
in the higher dose cohorts, although this may be expected since the duration of follow-up was
significantly longer. Also, patients in the higher dose cohorts may have had more severe or
poorly-controlled disease to begin with. There were more VO events on average in the year
before study entry among the higher compared to the lower dose cohort (0.8 VO events/year in
cohorts 1–4 versus 1.6 VO events/year in cohorts 5–7) and less hydroxyurea use (44% versus
83%). Importantly, regardless of dose cohort, there were no documented infections observed
during the course of the study. Cases occurred in which antibiotics were initiated, but no subject
completed a course of antibiotics. In all cases antibiotics were stopped per the discretion of the
treating physician, likely because no organisms were isolated on microbiology testing. Finally,
the formation of auto-antibodies to NKTT120 or otherwise were a theoretical concern, but there
were no anti-NKTT120 antibodies detected and no signs autoimmune disease in any subject.
Discussion
An intravenous bolus of NKTT120 produced rapid, specific and sustained iNKT cell depletion
without any infusional toxicity or attributed SAEs. Depletion and recovery of iNKT cells was
related to the pre-drug levels in circulation and the dose of NKTT120. At higher doses (0.1,
0.3, 1 mg/kg), all subjects were depleted of iNKT cells within 6 hours, but the length of time
they remained depleted varied between subjects. It could not be determined from this study
whether iNKT cell depletion with NKTT120 decreased the rate of VO pain episodes. A ran￾domized trial, in which repeated therapeutic doses of NKTT120 are administered with the aim
of iNKT cell depletion for long periods, will be required to test NKTT120’s efficacy.
If NKTT120 is to prevent VO, iNKT cells must be reduced in the tissues as well as in the cir￾culation. Peripheral blood iNKT cells represent only a fraction of the total iNKT cell popula￾tion in humans; the remainder resides outside the circulation in the tissues where most iNKT
cell activity occurs [19,20]. Though VO initiates as a vascular event, iNKT cells amplify the cri￾sis at the tissue level. If NKTT120 does not achieve tissue depletion, the target cells will either
re-equilibrate into circulation or promote the process of VO through cytokine production
from the tissues. In the lower 4 dose cohorts, re-equilibration from tissues likely occurred as
there was rapid recovery of circulating iNKT cells. In contrast, the 3 higher doses of NKTT120
produced sustained iNKT cell depletion that lasted beyond the time when NKTT120 could be
detected in the peripheral blood. Here, the target cells were likely depleted in the tissues as well
as the circulation, in which case recovery is a function of the drug’s half-life and the rate of
regeneration for iNKT cells.
iNKT cells are continuously regenerated in the thymus in a unique developmental process
that differs from conventional T cells [21]. Unlike conventional T cells, which mature and
acquire a memory phenotype after exposure to foreign antigens, iNKT cells are constantly
regenerated in the thymus by recognition of endogenous antigens, without the requirement
for prior exposure to a foreign antigen [22]. Thus, after depletion with NKTT120, the popula￾tion of iNKT cells would be expected to completely reconstitute with the same function as
before treatment. In fact, we demonstrated the normal function of iNKT cells upon return
after depletion in non-human primate toxicology studies. iNKT cells from 6 animals from the
highest NKTT120 dose groups that had recovered iNKT cells (0.1 mg/kg and 0.3 mg/kg,
respectively) were compared to iNKT cells in samples from 2 naïve control animals following
treatment with an iNKT cell activating glycolipid, α-galactosylcerimide. iNKT cells were acti￾vated to the same degree in recovered animals and control animals, as reflected by up-regula￾tion of the early activation marker CD69 (unpublished observation).
NKTT120 depletes iNKT cells in SCD

In contrast, if a clonally-expanded population of memory T cells is pharmacologically
depleted, they can only recover when new emigrants from the thymus, with identically rear￾ranged TCRs, are exposed to similar or identical pathologic antigen as the original insult. This
clonal loss or diminution of memory T cells, a well-known complication of pan-lymphocyte or
T cell-depleting antibodies, can leave holes in immune systems and patients susceptible to
infections. NKTT120, on the other hand, could be dosed repeatedly without permanent effects
on immunity because no loss of memory phenotype is associated with depletion of iNKT cells.
In our study, a dose of 1 mg/kg (dose cohort 7), which depleted all subjects for at least 2
months, would facilitate an every 3 month dose schedule to keep iNKT cells depleted chroni￾cally in both the peripheral blood and the tissues. And, because recovery was defined as return
of iNKT cells above the LLOQ as opposed to pre-NKTT120 levels, fewer iNKT cells will be
present when subjects are re-dosed. Therefore the impact on tissue depletion would be
expected to be greater with multiple doses than with a one-time dose.
No SAEs were attributed to NKTT120 as part of this study, but there are theoretical con￾cerns about long-term iNKT cell depletion: cancer, autoimmunity and infection [23–25]. Mice
with an absence of iNKT cells have a normal life expectancy and normal fertility. They do not
develop cancer, but autoimmune nephritis has been reported [26]. In regards to infection risk,
there is no clear evidence to suggest these mice are predisposed to infections. Studies of iNKT
cell-deficient mice, either CD1d-/- or Jα18-/-, show variable responses when infected with sev￾eral types of bacteria, as well as fungi, protozoa and viruses [27–30]. Absence of iNKT cells
sometimes worsens outcomes and sometimes improves outcomes with no clear relationship to
the nature of the pathogen [27–36]. In humans, there are no reports of a patient with a pure
deficiency of iNKT cells. The evidence to suggest an increased risk of infections due to iNKT
cell deficiency is descriptions of patients with combined deficiencies. One case of disseminated
varicella observed after administration of a live vaccine in a patient with an NKT cell deficiency
has been reported [37]. In this patient, it is not clear whether the deficiency was restricted to
iNKT (Type 1 NKT targeted by NKTT120) cells or included Type 2 NKT (not targeted by
NKTT120) cells as well. In addition, patients with a combined defect in NK and NKT cells
have been reported to have an increased susceptibility to infections with the human herpes
virus family [38]. It is unclear whether the absence of NKT cells contributes to this susceptibil￾ity, though, as patients with a pure defect in NK cells are known to be at risk for infections
with the human herpes virus family. In patients with cancer and autoimmune disease, lower
levels of iNKT cells have been reported, but whether this is a cause or effect of the condition is
not known [39–41].
There were limitations to our study. First, NKTT120 was administered to subjects once.
Longer term studies will be required to assess the risk of NKTT120 therapy. Two subjects,
however, were depleted of iNKT cells for 5 months or greater with no SAEs attributed to
NKTT120. Regardless of the study’s duration, the theoretical risks of the drug must be weighed
against the real risks of VO: the average life expectancy for an adult with SCD is less than 50
years, largely because of VO [1]. Second, the current study only determined pharmacokinetics,
pharmacodynamics and safety. It was not designed to determine the clinical efficacy of
NKTT120. There were admissions for VO pain in our study, even among subjects whose
iNKT cells were depleted. In fact, subjects in the higher dose cohorts, who were depleted for
longer, accounted for the majority of the pain events. However, compared to subjects in the
lower dose cohorts, those in the higher dose cohorts were also followed for a significantly lon￾ger period of time. Additionally, their disease was likely more poorly-controlled and their
phenotype more severe than the lower dose cohorts. Those in higher dose cohorts had less
hydroxyurea use, a higher white blood cell and reticulocyte count, a higher historical rate of
pain admissions, and a higher prevalence of avascular necrosis and cumulative number of

morbidities compared to the those in the lower dose cohorts. Given the differences between
subjects and lack of a control group, these events provide little insight into NKTT120’s poten￾tial as therapeutic for SCD. NKTT120’s ability to decrease VO and reduce the rate of pain and
inflammation will need to be determined in future studies, with appropriate controls, when
repeated doses of NKTT120 deplete iNKT cells for a length of time sufficient to capture differ￾ences in VO rate. And regardless, no therapy, short of a cure, will likely prevent all episodes of
pain. Hydroxyurea, a highly efficacious therapy for SCD, reduces VO pain rate by 50%, a
reduction in VO which confers a significant mortality benefit [42,43]. If NKTT120 could dem￾onstrate a reduction in pain events similar to hydroxyurea, patients with SCD would benefit
tremendously.
NKTT120 has the potential to impact clinical care for patients with SCD. Through a reduc￾tion in inflammation and prevention of VO events, NKTT120 would add to the limited arma￾mentarium of treatments for patients with SCD. Hydroxyurea is currently the only therapy
approved to prevent VO, but, unfortunately, it’s ineffective in up to 50% patients, mostly
because of the need for daily doses [44]. NKTT120’s dose regimen of every 3 month infusions
in the clinic is a major advantage. Providers will be ensured of patient’s receipt of the drug and
patients will not burdened by a daily medicine. This study determined that up to a 1 mg/kg
dose of NKTT120 could be administered safely with a rapid, yet sustained, effect on iNKT cell
depletion. The next step is a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial to determine the
ability of repeat-dose NKTT120 to decrease the rate of VO pain, as well as determine the risks,
if any, to long-term iNKT cell depletion.
