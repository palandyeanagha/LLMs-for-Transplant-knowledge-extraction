Abstract
Background: Since the term chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN) was removed from the Banff scheme in 2005,
transplant glomerulopathy (TG) has been regarded as a clinicopathological entity that is one of the major causes of
graft loss. To assess the distinction between CAN and TG, we performed a comprehensive evaluation comparing TG
with traditional CAN.
Methods: We compared the clinicopathological features of 43 cases of TG with 43 matched cases of non-TG CAN
(non-TG group) after renal transplantation. TG was diagnosed by light microscopy based on the double contours of
the glomerular basement membranes, and the Banff 97 classification system was used to score TG severity (cg0-3).
Results: Compared to the control group, we found a significantly higher incidence of positivity for human
leukocyte antigen class-I and II antibodies, a higher incidence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, and poorer graft
survival in TG patients. Clinically, TG was associated with a higher prevalence of proteinuria, hematuria, anaemia and
hypoalbuminemia. Histologically, TG strongly correlated with antibody related microcirculatory injuries, including
glomerulitis, peritubular capillaritis and peritubular capillary (PTC) C4d deposition. Interestingly, the TG patients
showed a significantly higher incidence of IgA deposition than the control patients. C4d-positive TG was correlated
with higher TG and PTC scores, and PTC C4d deposition was correlated with a more rapid progression to graft
dysfunction. TG accompanied by HCV infection was associated with heavier proteinuria, higher TG and C4d scores,
and poorer graft survival.
Conclusions: TG presents clinicopathological features that are distinct from non-TG cases and leads to poorer
outcomes. PTC C4d deposition is related to a more rapid progression to graft loss, suggesting ongoing antibody
reactivity. HCV-positive TG is a more severe sub-entity, that requires further investigation.

Background
Transplant glomerulopathy (TG), a pathologic condition
of renal allografts that was first described 40 years
ago, was considered to be a feature of chronic allograft
nephropathy (CAN) for decades. However, emerging evi￾dence suggests that TG is a pathologic entity that is dis￾tinct from other forms of CAN. Since the elimination of
the term CAN [1] by the Banff working group in 2005,
TG has been recognised as a lesion with a specific
morphology showing a strong association with immune
mechanisms [2]. The characteristic thickened capillary
walls and double contours of the glomerular basement
membrane (GBM) after periodic-acid-Schiff and/or silver
staining can be observed using light microscopy. Clini￾cally, TG is characterised by proteinuria, hypertension
and declining graft function. In addition, TG is often
associated with indicators of antibody-mediated rejec￾tion (AMR) such as the presence of donor-specific anti￾bodies (DSAs) and positive peritubular capillary (PTC)
C4d staining, and it is therefore considered to be an ex￾ample of chronic AMR. * Correspondence: zhihong–liu@hotmail.com †

Previous studies have demonstrated that TG is strong￾ly associated with circulating alloantibodies [3,4], posi￾tive PTC C4d staining [5], and prior AMR [6]. These
findings substantiate the hypothesis that humoral im￾munity plays a key role in the pathogenesis of TG. How￾ever, PTC C4d deposition is not necessary for diagnosis
of TG [7], and the significance of PTC C4d deposition in
TG remains unclear, as the data reported from different
studies are highly variable [7,8].
Recent studies investigating kidney transplant failure
have focused on the role of humoral rejection. A num￾ber of the observed lesions are considered to represent
antibody-mediated injury, such as PTC C4d deposition,
glomerulitis, peritubular capillaritis, PTC basement mem￾brane multi-layering, and even TG. Interestingly, lesions
such as antibody-mediated microcirculation injuries were
recently reported to be the major causes of late kidney
transplant failure [9]. As TG is believed to be a result of
antibody reactivity, it will be interesting to determine the
relationship between TG and other antibody-mediated
microcirculatory injuries.
In this study we compare the clinicopathological fea￾tures of TG patients with traditional CAN patients. Our
data show that TG strongly correlates with antibody￾mediated microcirculation injury. Furthermore, PTC
C4d deposition is associated with a more rapid progres￾sion to allograft dysfunction, and we propose that this is
due to ongoing antibody reactivity. We also describe, for
the first time, IgA deposition in the mesangial area of
TG patients. We further propose that hepatitis C virus
(HCV)-positive TG is a more severe sub-entity that
requires further investigation.
Methods
Patient selection and evaluation
From January 2004 to December 2008, 327 renal allo￾graft biopsies were performed at our institute. The biop￾sies were performed to investigate worsening renal
function and/or proteinuria. Among these cases, 43 pa￾tients had been diagnosed with TG based on pathological
duplication of the GBM, after exclusion of other condi￾tions that might result in similar histological changes,
such as recurrent membranoproliferative glomerulone￾phritis and thrombotic micro-angiopathies.
The TG patients were matched with 43 cases of
non-TG traditional CAN (non-TG group) as controls
for post-transplantation observation. The selection of
the control group was based on the following criteria:
(1) transplantation was performed in the same period;
(2) non-TG traditional CAN was confirmed by biopsy;
(3) no duplication of the GBM was observed; and (4)
patients were followed-up with for more than a year
after the biopsy was performed. Patients who suffered
from acute rejection at the time of biopsy were
excluded from both groups. Written informed consent
was obtained from all patients. The Human Subjects
Committee of Jinling Hospital, Nanjing University
School of Medicine approved all study protocols.
An electronic patient follow-up system has been used
to record information at each follow-up appointment
since 2000. Clinical and laboratory data on the patients
were extracted from their medical records, including
their age, gender, primary disease, post-transplantation
day at biopsy, serum levels of creatinine and albumin,
proteinuria, hematuria, and HCV infection status at
biopsy, type of immunosuppressive drugs used, history
of biopsy-proven acute rejection episodes and graft
outcome.
Immunosuppressants
Two main immunosuppressive protocols were employed:
1) cyclosporine A (CsA), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)
and steroids; and 2) Tacrolimus (Tac), MMF and steroids.
The initial dose of MMF was 1.5 g/day. The maintenance
doses were adjusted to trough levels of 6–12 ng/ml
during the first 6 months and 4–8 ng/ml during the
second 6 months for Tac, or 150–250 ng/ml during the
first 6 months and 100–200 ng/ml during the second
6 months for CsA. The maintenance dose of corticoste￾roid was 5 mg/day 1 year after transplantation. Initially,
some patients were given azathioprine instead of MMF.
Histopathology
The biopsies were evaluated via light microscopy, im￾munofluorescence (IF) and electron microscopy. IF mi￾croscopy was employed for the detection of IgG, IgM,
IgA, C3, C4, and C1q (DAKO, Denmark). C4d staining
was routinely performed using an indirect IF technique
in frozen sections with a primary affinity-purified mo￾noclonal mouse anti-human antibody (dilution 1:50;
1.5 hours incubation at room temperature; Quidel San
Diego, CA) and a FITC-labelled affinity-purified secon￾dary rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:20; 40-minutes
incubation at room temperature; DAKO, Denmark).
Staining was performed according to standard proce￾dures. All of the biopsies contained at least 10 glomeru￾lar and 2 arterial sections. The biopsies were diagnosed
and scored according to the Banff classification [10]. TG
was diagnosed via light microscopy based on double con￾tours of the GBM, supported by IF analyses, showing
mesangial IgM and/or C3 or negative IF findings. The
electron microscopy results also corresponded to a diag￾nosis of TG. The Banff 97 classification system was used
to score TG severity (cg0-3). PTC inflammation was
scored based on the Banff 2007 classification system [11].
To assess cellular infiltration in graft tissues, 2 μm
sections were deparaffinised with xylene and rehy￾drated using graded ethanol concentrations. Antigen

retrieval was performed by applying steam for 5 minutes
(a heat-induced epitope retrieval method). Immunohisto￾chemical staining was conducted using the avidin-biotin￾peroxidase technique employing 3,3-diaminobenzidine
as the chromogen with the automated BioTek system
(Ventana/BioTek Solutions, Tucson, AZ). All stainings
were performed using rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Dako,
Trappes, France) at a 1:100 dilution. CD3, CD4, and
CD8 were employed as markers for T lymphocytes,
and CD68 was used as a marker for macrophages (all
antibodies were obtained from Dako).
Several histopathological parameters were studied, in￾cluding transplant glomerulopathy, glomerulitis, peritub￾ular capillaritis and mesangial matrix (MM) expansion.
Interstitial fibrosis (ci), tubular atrophy (ct), and fibrous
intimal thickening (cv) were used to characterise chronic
lesions, and all of the lesions were scored based on the
Banff 1997 and/or Banff 2007 classification systems.
Anti-HLA antibody analysis
Patients were screened for human leukocyte antigen
(HLA) class I and class II antibodies using FlowPRAW
(One Lambda, USA) at the time of biopsy. Sera showing
>10% FlowPRAW class I and/or II reactivity were consid￾ered anti-HLA antibody-positive. All of the patients
PRA test were negative prior to renal transplantation.
Additional sera were stored for future use.
Statistical analysis
Measurement data were expressed as the means ± SD.
Differences between groups were analysed with the Stu￾dent’t test, and the Student-Newman-Keuls method was
used for multiple comparisons. Qualitative data were
described as percentages and analysed using the Chi￾square (χ2
) test as indicated. Survival curves were cal￾culated via the Kaplan-Meier survival analyses and
compared using the log-rank test. The reported P value
is two-sided, and the values less than 0.05 were consid￾ered statistically significant. All analyses were performed
using SPSS software (Version 13.0, SPSS Inc., USA).
Results
Clinical findings
The demographic and clinical details of the two groups
are outlined in Table 1. There were no significant differ￾ences between the demographic characteristics of the
groups. Allograft biopsies were performed at 4.93 ± 2.72
and 4.53 ± 2.52 years post-transplantation in the non-TG
and TG groups, respectively. All of the patients were on
triple immunosuppressive medications with calcineurin
inhibitors, MMF, and prednisone.
TG was correlated with a higher incidence of protein￾uria (40/43, 93.0% vs. 20/43, 46.5%, P < 0.001) and
hematuria (13/43, 30.2% vs. 5/43, 11.6%, P = 0.034).
Almost all of the patients in the TG group suffered from
proteinuria, which was significantly heavier compared to
the control group (2.01 ± 1.60 g/d vs. 0.89 ± 0.96 g/d,
P = 0.001). In the TG group, the majority of the patients
(30/43, 69.8%) had urine protein levels of over 1 g/day,
whereas the percentage of patients showing such levels
was only 25.5% (11/43) in the non-TG group (P < 0.001).
TG was also correlated with higher incidences of an￾aemia (37/43, 86.0% vs. 28/43, 65.1%; P = 0.022) and
hypoalbuminemia (26/43, 60.5% vs 5/43, 11.6%,
P < 0.001). The mean haemoglobin level in the TG group
was significantly lower than the non-TG group
(9.48 ± 2.18 vs. 10.66 ± 2.01 P = 0.011). We also observed
a higher prevalence of HCV infection in TG group than
in the non-TG group (Table 2). Interestingly, graft func￾tion and previous acute rejection episodes were similar
in the two groups.
Anti-HLA antibodies
An anti-HLA antibody test was performed at the time of
the biopsy in 30 patients with TG and in 23 patients
with non-TG, and significantly more patients in the TG
group were classed as positive (>10% FlowPRAW class I
and/or II reactivity) for anti-HLA antibodies (20/30,
66.7% vs. 5/23, 21.7%; P = 0.001). Among these patients,
15% were positive for class I, 55% for class II and 30%
for both class I and class II antibodies. The incidence of

positivity was significantly higher in the TG group for
both HLA-I and II antibodies.
Pathologic features
All of the patients were subjected to an ultrastructural
histological examination, and patients with a confoun￾ding diagnosis of immune complex glomerulonephritis
were excluded. The diagnosis of TG was confirmed via
electron microscopy. Compared to the non-TG group,
TG was strongly correlated with hallmarks of antibody￾mediated lesions (Table 3), such as peritubular capillaritis
(40/43, 93.0% vs. 15/43, 34.9%; P < 0.0001), glomerulitis
(40/43, 93.0% vs. 27/43, 62.8%; P = 0.001), and PTC C4d
deposition (30/43, 69.8% vs. 14/43; 32.6%, P = 0.001). In
addition, the samples from the TG group received signifi￾cantly higher scores of C4d (1.91 ± 1.32 vs. 0.58 ± 0.96;
P < 0.0001), PTC (1.88 ± 0.79 vs. 0.49 ± 0.73; P < 0.0001),
glomerulitis (1.35 ± 0.69 vs. 0.79 ± 0.74; P < 0.001) and
MM expansion (1.58 ± 0.62 vs. 1.07 ± 0.63, P < 0.001).
Interestingly, we also noted a higher incidence of IgA
staining in the TG group (44.2% vs 16.3%; P = 0.005). The
incidences and degrees of chronic tubular, interstitial,
and vascular sclerosis were similar between the TG and
non-TG groups. In the case of glomerulitis, the majority
of infiltrating cells were CD68+, with the next most
prevalent groups being CD4+ and CD8+ cells. CD4+
cells were significantly more abundant in the samples
from the TG group, compared to the non-TG group
(P = 0.002). Similarly, labelling the PTC via CD31 staining
revealed that CD68+ cells were also the major cause of
PTC inflammation (data not shown).
Graft survival
Figure 1 shows the Kaplan-Meier survival curves for
death-censored graft outcomes in the two groups. Sig￾nificantly more patients in the TG group lost their grafts
(44.2% vs. 18.6%; P = 0.05) during the follow-up period.
The median graft survival was 115.4 months in the TG
group, compared to 170.4 months in the non-TG group.
Graft survival was also worse in the TG group when
measured from the time of biopsy (34.1 months vs.
38.1 months; P = 0.04) (Figure 2).
PTC C4d deposition in TG
Our data revealed a high incidence of PTC C4d deposition
in samples from the TG group; however, PTC C4d depos￾ition is not necessary for diagnosis of TG. Tables 4 and 5
allow comparison of the clinical and histological features
between the C4d-positive (n = 30) and C4d-negative

(n = 13) TG patients. C4d-positive TG was associated with
a higher TG score (2.07 ± 0.89 vs. 1.44 ± 0.66, P = 0.018)
and PTC score (2.10 ± 0.48 vs. 1.38 ± 1.12; P = 0.044). Sig￾nificantly more individuals were positive for HLA-II anti￾bodies among the C4d + TG patients vs. C4d- TG patients
(14/19, 73.6% vs. 3/11, 27.3%; P = 0.018). Although there
were no statistically significant differences detected, we
observed a trend towards increased hypoalbuminemia and
a higher incidence of HCV infection in the C4d + group.
HCV infection in TG
We observed that the incidence of HCV infection in the
TG patients was significantly higher compared with
the non-TG patients (34.9% vs. 7.0%; P = 0.003). As the
characteristics of HCV-positive TG are not clear, we
compared the clinical and pathologic features of HCV￾positive and HCV-negative patients. The HCV-posi￾tive patients exhibited significantly heavier proteinuria
(2.74 ± 1.71 vs. 1.65 ± 1.36; P = 0.029), lower serum albu￾min (31.15 ± 6.12 vs. 35.13 ± 3.28; P = 0.009) and poorer
liver function. Pathologically, the HCV-positive samples
received a higher C4d score (2.53 ± 1.06 vs. 1.57 ± 1.34,
P = 0.021) and a higher TG score (2.27 ± 0.79 vs.
1.68 ± 0.81; P = 0.029) (Table 6), but the distribution of
IgA staining did not differ between the HCV-positive
and HCV-negative TG patients. In terms of graft sur￾vival (Figure 3 and 4), HCV-positive TG was associated
with poorer graft survival. Furthermore, it is further not￾able that HCV-positive TG was correlated with a higher
incidence of hematuria (46.7% vs. 21.4%; P = 0.087) and
PTC C4d deposition (86.7% vs. 60.7%; P = 0.075).
Discussion
In this report, we describe the clinicopathological fea￾tures of patients with TG, C4d-positive TG and HCV￾positive TG. Compared to the non-TG group, we find
that: (1) TG is correlated with high incidences of pro￾teinuria, anaemia and hypoalbuminemia and poorer graft
survival; (2) TG is strongly correlated with antibody￾mediated microcirculatory injury, especially in cases of

glomerulitis and peritubular capillaritis; (3) TG accom￾panied by HCV infection is a more severe sub-entity and
correlates with a poorer graft survival; and (4) TG is
associated with a high incidence of IgA deposition in the
mesangial area.
Our data show that TG patients present unique clini￾copathological characteristics compared to non-TG
patients. Clinically, TG was correlated with higher inci￾dences of proteinuria, hematuria and hypoalbuminemia.
While proteinuria was also observed in half of the
non-TG patients, the amount of urine protein was sig￾nificantly lower compared to the TG group. Similarly,
anaemia was more common and severe in the TG
group, and TG was associated with both reduced graft
function and reduced graft survival [12]. Moreover, TG
was correlated with the presence of anti-HLA antibodies,
especially anti-HLA class-II antibodies [13]. Taken
together these findings suggest that TG is a clinical entity
that is distinct from non-TG cases. Notably, there was a
significantly higher incidence of anaemia in the TG
group, suggesting that other factors beyond the absence
of TG are responsible for anaemia in TG patients.
In addition to its clinical features, TG differs from
non-TG cases with respect to histological features.
Patients suffering from TG exhibited a higher incidence
of peritubular capillaritis, glomerulitis, and PTC C4d de￾position. These lesions, which are thought to be caused
by antibody reactivity, have previously been described as
antibody-mediated microcirculatory injuries [9]. Our
data revealed a predominance of microcirculatory injur￾ies in the TG group, supporting the hypothesis that TG
is mediated by donor-specific antibodies. Almost all TG
patients showed signs of glomerulitis, and/or peritubular
capillaritis, and/or PTC C4d deposition (Figure 5). As
the scores for chronic lesions, such as ci, cv and ct, were
similar between the TG and non-TG groups, it is pos￾sible that the severe microcirculatory injuries observed
in TG patients contribute to their poor graft outcomes.
While PTC C4d deposition has been regarded as a
marker of in situ antibody reactivity [14], the reported
incidences of PTC C4d deposition in TG patients are
quite variable between different studies [15,16]. In the
present cohort, C4d-positive TG is correlated with a
higher incidence of positivity for HLA-II antibodies and
lower levels of serum albumin. We did not find signifi￾cant differences in other clinical features between cases
of TG with or without PTC C4d deposition. Previous
studies have shown that PTC C4d deposits are more
common in TG than other glomerular diseases that
occur after transplantation, and it has been suggested
that PTC C4d deposits may indicate that in situ humoral
rejection is relevant for the development of TG [17,18].
PTC C4d deposition has been shown to be correlated

with circulating donor-specific antibodies, that induce
endothelial cellular apoptosis independent of the action
of the complement system [19]. Further data revealed
that graft survival is significantly poorer in TG than in
non-TG patients; more than 50% of patients diagnosed
with TG achieved an end point of allograft loss or loss of
>50% of the glomerular filtration rate over 36 months
after transplantation [20]. Interestingly, C4d positivity
was associated with a more rapid rate of transplant func￾tion decline [21,22]. Taken together, these findings sug￾gest that PTC C4d deposition is very likely to be
correlated with on-going alloantibody reactivity.
Our study revealed a higher incidence of PTC C4d
staining, glomerulitis, and peritubular capillaritis com￾pared to earlier reports. This finding is most likely due
to a bias in patient selection; in the present cohort, all
of the biopsies were for-cause biopsies, while earlier
studies also included protocol biopsies [13]. Other pos￾sible reasons for these findings are that 1) after an
acute antibody-mediated injury, the progression of ca￾pillary lesions does not involve complement activation;
and 2) the interactions between antibodies and the
endothelium are episodic and not continuous, making
C4d an inconstant marker [4]. The cohort studies
described here reflect an active process of TG, which
may explain why patients showing PTC C4d deposition
suffer from more rapid graft loss. Based on current evi￾dence, we hypothesise that the development of TG is a
long-term process, and that the associated doubled
contour is most likely not (or not easily) reversible.
However, active immunological responses to antibody
reactivity might disappear, and we suggest that control￾ling active lesions after remission may slow graft
dysfunction.
One-third of the TG patients included in this study
suffered from HCV infection. This high incidence of
HCV infection is concordant with previous studies
[23,24]. As observed in the present study, HCV-positive
TG is characterised by heavier proteinuria, lower serum
albumin, higher TG and C4d scores, and poorer graft
survival. These findings are supported by the results of
Baid-Agrawal et al. [25], who demonstrated that graft
survival in TG patients is poorer when they are HCV￾positive. HCV infection may increase humoral immune
alloreactivity in some patients, which is important for
the development of TG. Based on the features described
above, we thus conclude that HCV-positive TG is likely
to be a more severe subtype of TG. It is possible that
HCV infection can induce an aggressive process that
leads to graft failure. As strong immunosuppressants
usually stimulate the proliferation of HCV, these patients
require careful observation.
The present study unexpectedly revealed a higher inci￾dence of IgA deposition in the mesangial area in TG
patients. To our knowledge, this is the first report de￾scribing an association of increased IgA deposition with
TG. Because IgA deposition was similar in HCV-positive
and HCV-negative patients, the increased incidence of
glomerular IgA deposition in patients with TG appears
to have no correlation with HCV infection. This inter￾esting finding is supported by recently reported genome￾wide analysis data showing a strong association between
HLA and IgA nephropathy [26]. This study, identified
three independent loci in the major histocompatibility
complex, and the strongest HLA signal was identified in
the region of HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQB1. Another
study further showed that the HLA region contains the
strongest common susceptibility alleles that predispose
Figure 5 TG is strongly correlated with the antibody and antibody-related lesions: the incidence of HLA antibodies (HLA-I antibodies:
30% vs. 4.3%, P = 0.018; HLA-II antibodies: 56.7% vs. 17.4%, P = 0.004), PTC C4d deposition (69.8% vs. 32.6%, P = 0.001), PTC
inflammation (93.0% vs. 34.9%, P < 0.001) and glomerulitis (93.0% vs. 62.8%, P = 0.001) were higher in TG patients.

patients to IgA nephropathy [27]. Taken together, these
studies suggest a correlation between HLA antibodies
and the development of IgA nephropathy, which may
explain the high incidence of IgA deposition observed in
our study. The role of HLA antibodies in IgA nephro￾logy should be investigated in future studies.
Conclusion
In conclusion, we demonstrate that TG patients exhibit
significantly higher incidences of proteinuria, anaemia,
hypoalbuminemia, positivity for HLA- II antibodies and
HCV infection. TG is strongly correlated with antibody￾mediated microcirculation injury, especially in cases of
glomerulitis and peritubular capillaritis. The graft sur￾vival rate in TG patients is poorer compared with con￾trol patients. PTC C4d deposition is associated with a
more rapid progression to allograft dysfunction, sugges￾ting on-going antibody reactivity. HCV-positive TG is a
more severe sub-entity that requires further investiga￾tion. Similarly, IgA deposition in the mesangial area was
commonly found in TG patients, and determination of
its role in TG requires further study.
