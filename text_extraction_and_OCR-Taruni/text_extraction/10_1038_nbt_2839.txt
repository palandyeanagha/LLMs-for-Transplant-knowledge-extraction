To the Editor
There is a growing trend toward public dissemination of proteomics
data, which is facilitating the assessment, reuse, comparative
analyses and extraction of new findings from published data1,2. This
process has been mainly driven by journal publication guidelines
and funding agencies. However, there is a need for better
integration of public repositories and coordinated sharing of all the
pieces of information needed to represent a full mass spectrometry
(MS)–based proteomics experiment. An editorial in your journal in
2009, 'Credit where credit is overdue'3, exposed the situation in the
proteomics field, where full data disclosure is still not common
practice. Olsen and Mann4 identified different levels of information
in the typical experiment: from raw data and going through peptide
identification and quantification, protein identifications and protein
ratios and the resulting biological conclusions. All of these levels
should be captured and properly annotated in public databases,
using the existing MS proteomics repositories for the MS data (raw
data, identification and quantification results) and metadata,
whereas the resulting biological information should be integrated in
protein knowledge bases, such as UniProt5. A recent editorial6 in
Nature Methods again highlighted the need for a stable repository
for raw MS proteomics data. In this Correspondence, we report the


first implementation of the ProteomeXchange consortium, an
integrated framework for submission and dissemination of MS-
based proteomics data.
