To determine whether hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a cause 
of hepatitis among HIV-infected persons, we evaluated 
1985–2009 data for US military benefi ciaries. Evidence of 
acute or prior HEV infection was detected for 7 (4%) and 5 
(3%) of 194 HIV-infected persons, respectively. HEV might 
be a cause of acute hepatitis among HIV-infected persons.
Among immunosuppressed persons in industrialized 
countries, hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a cause of 
sporadic acute viral hepatitis and chronic hepatitis (1,2). In 
the United States, liver test results are often abnormal for 
HIV-infected persons; however, few studies have evaluated 
whether HEV is a cause of hepatitis in this population (3).
The Study
We retrospectively evaluated HIV-infected persons 
for whom alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels had 
increased acutely (>5 × the upper limit of normal) during 
the HIV epidemic (1985–2009). Eligible participants were 
US military benefi ciaries (persons entitled to receive care 
at a military treatment facility) for whom a stored serum 
specimen, collected from 3 days before ALT increase 
through 180 days after ALT increase, was available for 
HEV testing. A case of acute HEV infection was defi ned 
as a sample with HEV RNA and/or IgM against HEV or 
evidence of IgG seroconversion. All samples collected 
at the time of ALT increase were tested for IgM and IgG 
against HEV by using commercially available enzyme 
immunoassays (Diagnostics Systems, Nizhniy Novgorod, 
Russia) (4) and PCR for HEV RNA (5). The testing strategy 
is shown in Figure 1. All positive results were verifi ed by 
retesting. 
Statistical analyses included descriptive statistics 
presented as numbers (percentages) for categorical 
variables and medians (interquartile ranges [IQRs]) for 
continuous variables. The percentage of participants with 
HEV infection was defi ned as the number with an initial 
positive result for IgM or IgG against HEV divided by 
the total number of evaluable study participants. To 
compare characteristics among those with and without 
HEV infection, we used Fisher exact testing for categorical 
variables and rank-sum testing for continuous variables. A 
multivariate logistic regression model was used to identify 
factors associated with HEV infection. All analyses were 
performed by using Stata version 10.0 (StataCorp LP, 
College Station, TX, USA).
Among 4,410 HIV-infected persons, 458 (10%) had 
increased ALT levels at least 1 time during 32,468 person￾years of follow-up. Among these, serum samples were 
available for HEV testing for 194 (42%) participants, 
among whom median age was 34 (IQR 30–40) years, 95% 
were male, and 42% were white (Table 1). The median 
ALT level was 440 (IQR 322–812) IU/mL. At the ALT 
spike, participants had been infected with HIV for a median 
duration of 5 (IQR 2–9) years; median CD4 cell count was 
436 (IQR 239–627) cells/mm3
, median plasma HIV RNA

level was 13,581 (IQR 762–71,586) copies/mL, and 28% 
of participants were receiving antiretroviral therapy.
Samples for HEV testing were available at a median of 
27 (IQR 0–104) days after the increase in ALT level. For 
13 (6.7%) participants, IgM and/or IgG against HEV were 
present at the time closest to the ALT increase; antibody 
prevalence among those with elevated ALT levels did not 
increase during the HIV epidemic (χ2
 0.76, p = 0.68). The 
13 HIV-infected persons who were HEV seropositive (IgM 
or IgG at ALT spike) were similar to the 181 who were 
HEV seronegative in terms of demographics, military duty 
status, laboratory data, and overseas travel (Table 1). HEV￾seropositive persons had higher plasma HIV RNA levels 
(4.7 vs. 4.1 log10 copies/mL, p = 0.04) and the association 
with lower CD4 cell counts was borderline (median 217 
vs. 439 cells/mm3
, p = 0.07). In the multivariate logistic 
regression model adjusted for age, plasma HIV RNA levels 
remained signifi cantly associated with HEV seropositivity 
(odds ratio 1.96 per log10, 95% CI 1.04–3.71, p = 0.04).
Additional testing was conducted for all 13 participants 
with IgM or IgG against HEV or with HEV RNA at the 
time of ALT increase (Figure 1). HEV RNA was detected 
in 1 participant who also seroconverted (IgG) at the time 
of ALT increase. According to samples collected at or 
near ALT spike and after ALT spike, 5 more participants 
seroconverted. One participant had IgM detectable in all 
3 samples (at or near ALT spike, after ALT spike, and at 
follow-up); the participant did not seroconvert, and HEV 
RNA was not detectable in any sample. In total, 7 (3.6%, 
95% CI 1.6%–7.6%) of the 194 HIV-infected persons had

evidence of acute HEV infection at time of ALT spike 
(Figure 2). HEV was deemed not to be the cause of the 
ALT spike for 5 participants with evidence of prior HEV 
infection because IgG positivity preceded the ALT increase.
For 1 participant, IgM was found in only 1 sample; all 
other samples were negative for IgM, IgG, and HEV RNA. 
Because of unconfi rmed positive follow-up results, this 
participant was excluded from further analysis.
For the 7 participants with acute HEV infection
(Table 2), HEV was not considered during the ALT 
increase, and HEV testing was not conducted as part 
of clinical care. No signifi cant differences in clinical 
or laboratory characteristics were found among the 7 
participants with acute HEV infection and those without 
evidence of HEV infection (data not shown). Chronic 
HEV infection did not develop in any participant.
Conclusions
HEV infection accounted for 4% of acute liver 
abnormalities among HIV-infected persons. Overall, HEV 
was detected in 6% of HIV-infected participants, similar 
to the 5%–21% reported earlier from the United States 
(1,6). Because study participation was limited to persons 
who had a sample available for HEV testing near the time 
of ALT increase, we might have missed cases of HEV 
infection. Overall, on the basis of our study and data from 
other industrialized countries (7,8), HEV is a cause of liver 
abnormalities in HIV-infected persons but does not seem 
to be more common in this population than in the general 
population.
HEV seropositivity did not increase over the course of 
the HIV epidemic. Despite increasing reports of HEV among 
HIV-infected persons and the general population (1,3,7–
10), this increase is probably associated with increased 
recognition and testing. Recent studies in the United States 
and Europe have shown that HEV seroprevalence is stable 
or decreasing (1,11).
HEV infections among HIV-infected persons have 
been reported (3,7–9,12); however, whether this population 
is at increased risk for HEV infection remains uncertain. 
Recent studies from Europe suggest that HIV-infected 
persons or other immunocompromised persons are not 
at increased risk of acquiring HEV infections (7–9,12). 
Nonetheless, these groups are at higher risk for chronic 
HEV infection (2,7,13).
We propose that a diagnosis of HEV infection be 
considered for persons with viral-like hepatitis. Serologic 
test results may be negative despite ongoing HEV infection; 
hence, for HIV-infected persons (especially those with low 
CD4 cell counts), PCR testing for HEV RNA should be 
conducted (7). Because HEV infection may be fulminant in 
the presence of underlying liver disease (common among 
HIV-infected persons) (14) and may lead to chronic infection 
in immunosuppressed persons (2,13), testing should be 
considered for these persons as treatment options for HEV 
infection evolve. Moreover, chronic HEV infection may be 
averted by reducing the level of immunosuppression (15) 
and use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (3,8), but 
more data are needed to support these measures.
HEV infection is a newly defi ned cause of acute liver 
dysfunction among HIV-infected persons in the United 
States. HEV infections do not seem to preferentially occur 
among HIV-infected persons, suggesting that HIV itself 
may not be a risk factor for HEV acquisition. HEV infection
