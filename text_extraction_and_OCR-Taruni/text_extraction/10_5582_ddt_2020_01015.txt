SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, remdesivir, safety, effect
The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 rapidly spread across China and worldwide. Remdesivir had been 
proposed as a promising option for treating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We provided a 
rapid review to critically assess the potential anti-coronavirus effect of remdesivir on COVID-19 
and other coronaviruses based on the most up-to-date evidence. Even though remdesivir was 
proposed as a promising option for treating COVID-19 based on laboratory experiments and reports 
from compassionate use, its safety and effect in humans requires high-quality evidence from well￾designed and adequately-powered clinical trials for further clarification.
1. Introduction
In early December 2019, a novel coronavirus named 
as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 
(SARS-CoV-2) occurred in Wuhan city located in Hubei 
province, China (1). Similar to previously identified 
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 
(SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus (MERS-CoV), SARS-CoV-2 is the third 
coronavirus that severely infects humans or even causes 
death (2). Initially, several SARS-CoV-2-infected 
pneumonia (coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19) 
were identified in Wuhan. Shortly afterwards, the 
outbreak of COVID-19 has rapidly spread across China 
and worldwide, which now becomes a serious threat 
to global public health (3,4). While there is no specific 
therapy for COVID-19 available, supportive care and 
sometimes combined with broad-spectrum antivirals 
and corticosteroids remain the mainstay as the standard 
practice (4). Therefore, it is urgently needed to identify 
more effective therapeutic options in response to the 
rapid propagation of SARS-CoV-2. Several medications 
have been proposed to be tested for the prevention and 
treatment of COVID-19, among which remdesivir (GS￾5734) has attracted substantial attention.
Remdesivir is a nucleotide analog prodrug that 
exhibits effective antiviral activity against a broad 
spectrum of human and zoonotic coronavirus in cell 
cultures and mouse models including SARS-CoV, 
MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. In addition, a recent 
case report of COVID-19 indicated the recovery of a 
35-year-old patient probably due to the administration 
of remdesivir, while no adverse events related to 
remdesivir was found (4). Other evidence also implicated 
that remdesivir may be an effective option to treat 
COVID-19. Therefore, in this rapid review we aimed to 
summarize the evidence of antiviral effect of remdesivir 
on the coronaviruses, and to discuss the potential 
application to COVID-19, after systematically searching 
the databases of PubMed and MEDLINE with the 
keywords related to remdesivir.
The potential mechanism of remdesivir for 
coronavirus remains unclear. Several reasons have been 
proposed to interpret the effect of remdesivir. First, 
remdesivir can interfere with the nsp12 polymerase even 
when the exoribonuclease proofreading activity is intact 
(5). Furthermore, remdesivir can efficiently generate 
pharmacologically active nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) 
that acts as an alternative substrate and RNA-chain 
terminator. Subsequently, NTP can inhibit coronavirus 
by incorporating active triphosphates into viral RNA 
(6). Additionally, there is a high genetic barrier to 
achieve resistance of coronavirus to remdesivir, which 
suggests that remdesivir can maintain the effectiveness 
of coronavirus therapies (7).
As a broad-spectrum antiviral agent, remdesivir 
has been reported to be effective against a group of 
coronavirus including alphacoronavirus (NL63) and

several SARS/MERS-CoV-like bat coronavirus (8). 
Below we summarized the most up-to-date evidence of 
remdesivir for SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and the SARS￾CoV-2 of concern (Table 1).
2. MERS-CoV
A recent study compared antiviral effect on MERS￾CoV of several medications including remdesivir, 
lopinavir (LPV), ritonavir (RTV) and interferon beta 
(IFN-β) and the combination of LPV/RTV-IFN-β (9). 
The prophylactic and therapeutic effect of remdesivir 
on MERS-CoV was found to be superior to the other 
medications. Specifically, results from the in vitro
experiments showed that remdesivir had superior 
antiviral effect with a selectivity index (concentration 
causing a 50% reduction in replication/concentration 
causing a 50% cytotoxication) > 100 on Calu-3 cells, 
which was significantly higher than IFN-β (> 16), LPV 
(> 4.3) and RTV (> 2). Likewise, findings from the 
animal experiments demonstrated that prophylactic 
remdesivir could significantly inhibit MERS-CoV 
replication and diminish the pathological features of 
acute lung injury (ALI) in MERS-CoV-infected Ces1c-/-
mice, while only minimal effect was found in other 
antiviral medications. When the agents were given on 
the first day after low-dose infection (5E + 04 pfu), 
improved pulmonary functions were observed in both 
remdesivir and LPV/RTV-IFN-β groups. Nevertheless, 
reductions in several indices (including virus lung 
titers, viral antigen labeling in lung tissue sections, 
body weight loss, lung hemorrhage and signs of ALI) 
were only detected in the group treated with remdesivir. 
Furthermore, when a lethal dose of MERS-CoV (5E + 
05 pfu) was used, a reduced lung viral load in infected 
mice was only observed in remdesivir group, while no 
effect was found in other groups.
3. SARS-CoV-2
Wang et al. conducted an experiment to evaluate the 
anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect of remdesivir (10). In time￾of-addition assay using Vero E6 cells, remdesivir was 
found to be effective when administered 2 hours after 
infection at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.05. 
However, no prophylactic effect was observed when 
remdesivir was administered prior to the SARS-CoV-2 
infection. The concentration for 90% of maximal effect 
(EC90) value of remdesivir against SARS-CoV-2 was 
found to be 1.76 μM. This study also revealed that 
remdesivir could inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection in 
human liver cancer Huh-7 cells.
The recent case report recorded the administration 
of compassionate-use remdesivir on the 35-year-old man 
with COVID-19 in the United States (4). The patient 
had initial symptoms of mild cough and low-grade 
intermittent fevers; subsequently his nasopharyngeal 
and oropharyngeal swabs were tested positive for 
SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse-transcriptase￾polymerase-chain-reaction assay. His vital signs and 
respiratory status remained largely stable before the 9th
day of COVID-19 except for intermittent fevers and 
nonproductive cough. Since from day 9, the patient 
began to develop atypical pneumonia, with worsening 
chest radiograph, decreasing oxygen saturation values 
and substantial rales in both lungs. With remdesivir

 Experimental studies
• Remdesivir prophylactically inhibited SARS-CoV 
replication in human airway epithelial cell cultures. 
Prophylactic and early-stage therapeutic (within 1 
day after infection) effects against SARS-CoV were 
demonstrated in animal experiments (8).
• Calu-3 cell cultures and animal experiments indicated 
the prophylactic and therapeutic effects of remdesivir on 
MERS-CoV, and the effects were found to be superior to 
the other anti-viral medications (9).
• In time-of-addition assay using Vero E6 cells, 
remdesivir therapeutically (administered 2 hours after 
infection) inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication, while no 
prophylactic effect was found. Remdesivir could inhibit 
SARS-CoV-2 infection in human liver cancer Huh-7 cells 
(10).
 Human studies
• No evidence in human was reported.
• No evidence in human was reported.
• A case report in the United States of COVID-19 indicated 
the recovery of a patient probably due to the administration 
of remdesivir (4).
• A study of compassionate-use remdesivir reported clinical 
improvement in 68% of the 53 recruited patients who had 
severe COVID-19 (11).
• As of 28th April 2020, seven RCTs have been initiated, 
aiming to evaluate the benefit and harm effects of 
remdesivir for COVID-19 patients. No results have been 
available in the literature.

at the early stage of infection (before the initiation 
of the immunopathological phase of pneumonia) (8). 
By contrast, another study showed that remdesivir 
was found to be functional for SARS-CoV-2 when 
administered 2 hours after infection (10). These results 
indicated the benefit of remdesivir may heavily depend 
on the time of administration. No predefined plans of 
trial designs or statistical analyses are given in their 
protocols related to the optimum time of administration. 
Thirdly, the current evidence was insufficient to support 
the safety of remdesivir in humans. Even though some 
cytotoxicity tests suggested that remdesivir could be 
effective at a relatively low micromolar concentration 
compared with its cytotoxic concentration (8,9), 
the safety test in humans is still ongoing currently. 
Moreover, a previous randomized controlled trial 
reported that in patients with Ebola virus disease, the 
overall mortality was even higher in remdesivir group 
(53%) than the control group (a triple monoclonal 
antibody agent; 50%), although without significance 
(14). Therefore, extreme cautions and monitoring should 
be taken in the ongoing trials for COVID-19 given the 
safety of remdesivir remains largely unconfirmed and 
unknown. 
To summarize, even though remdesivir was proposed 
as a promising option for treating COVID-19 based on 
laboratory experiments and reports from compassionate 
use, its safety and effect in humans requires high-quality 
evidence from well-designed and adequately-powered 
clinical trials for further clarification. Similar to the 
inconclusive effect on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, 
the impact of remdesivir on the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak 
should not be overestimated in the current clinical 
practice. Further explorations remain urgently needed to 
treat the COVID-19 and bring the SARS-CoV-2 under 
control.

administered on day 11, significant improvements in 
oxygen saturation values, rales and other symptoms 
were observed on day 12, indicating the rapid benefit 
of remdesivir. Subsequently, the patient returned 
to be afebrile, and all symptoms had resolved with 
the exception of mild cough. Besides, a recently 
published study revealed results of compassionate 
use of remdesivir for patients with severe COVID-19 
(11). In 53 patients who received at least one dose 
of remdesivir, 36 (68%) had clinical improvements, 
including changes on oxygen-support and extubation 
of mechanical ventilation. The mortality of the patients 
was 13%, which was lower than the general mortality 
of severe patients with COVID-19 (over 50%), as 
reported by the WHO (12).
The current evidence on experimental studies and 
clinical observation indicated that remdesivir has the 
potential for treating COVID-19. Nevertheless, findings 
from the compassionate-use study were not adequately 
powered with a randomized controlled design to assess 
the safety and efficacy of remdisivir in patients with 
severe COVID-19. Therefore, more evidence from 
randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of high quality is 
eventually needed to confirm its safety and efficacy. 
Two phase III clinical trials had been launched in 
Hubei and Beijing in China in early February 2020, 
aiming to evaluate the safety and efficacy of remdesivir 
for adult patients with COVID-19 and with mild￾moderate (NCT04252664, sample size: 308) and 
severe (NCT04257656, sample size: 452) symptoms. 
Subsequently, other five RCTs with similar objectives 
were further registered on clinicaltrials.gov. However, 
as of 28th April 2020, there has not been published 
results available in the literature. Therefore, it remains 
largely unknown currently regarding the benefit-harm 
profile of remdesivir for COVID-19.
In brief, remdesivir has been found to inhibit 
coronavirus and improve pulmonary functions 
prophylactically and therapeutically (in early stage of 
infection) based on evidence from both in vitro and in 
vivo experiments. However, evidence in patients with 
COVID-19 remained limited and sparse.
The ongoing clinical trials will provide more 
high-quality evidence on the benefit-harm effect of 
remdesivir. Nevertheless, there are several issues of 
concern regarding their protocols. First, the inclusion/
exclusion criteria and the outcome measurements do not 
include chest radiography that is one of the key elements 
for disease diagnosis and criteria for recovery according 
to Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Novel 
Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) Infection by the National 
Health Commission (Trial Version 5) published by 
National Health and Health Commission of the people's 
Republic of China (13). Thus, it may incur selection 
and reporting bias to weaken the results. Secondly, 
based on the previous experiments on SARS-CoV, 
remdesivir was effective only when it was administered
