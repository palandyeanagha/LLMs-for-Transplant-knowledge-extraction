Abstract
During the last years, tissue engineering-based therapies have been introduced in clinical practice
in the head and face area. The regeneration of complex tissue structures for all sites of the body is
envisioned for the future. In the present situation, specialists of the different fields publish excellent
research papers in specialised journals. As a result, the scientific community, seperated towards
distinct sub-specialities, has difficulties in communication. To overcome this problem, the
demanding, complex and interdisciplinary aspects of tissue engineering has to be approached from
new ways. We have conceptualised Head & Face Medicine therefore as a thematically broad ranged
journal, including all disciplines involved in the head and neck area. We hope this journal will attract
basic researchers and clinicians who are involved in investigating and applying complex themes
(examplified by tissue engineering) in the head and face region and will contribute to a gain in
scientific information, communication, and collaboration in order to improve the outcome of
patient treatments.
Tissue engineering is a new and fast growing branch of
medicine that has now been introduced in clinical prac￾tice. The regeneration of various tissues for all sites of the
body is envisioned for the future. The artificial generation
of hard and soft tissues offers clinicians new tools in the
treatment of various diseases of the head and face region.
On the other hand, tissue engineering poses significant
challenges, which needed to be overcome before this
treatment option can be routinely performed.
One of the reasons for the fast growth of tissue engineer￾ing is the high number of excellent research papers, pub￾lished in a wide array of (material-, biological-,
biomedical-, biophysical-, and clinical-based) journals,
covering all aspects of basic research, preclinical testing
and clinical application. Additionally, numerous high
quality books are available describing in detail the differ￾ent aspects of tissue engineering. Despite the fact that var￾ious journals publish excellent research papers focusing
on specialised areas of tissue engineering, we decided to
also include papers on such specialties in our journal,
Head & Face Medicine. There were two reasons for this
decision: during the phase of establishment of tissue engi￾neering in our clinics on an experimental and clinical
level, we observed that many specialists of the different
fields involved in approaching tissue engineering, had dif￾ficulties in overviewing the complexity of the field. Sec￾ondly, as tissue engineering forces basic researchers,
mainly having a biological, biophysical or material sci￾ence oriented background, to closely collaborate with
clinically oriented physicians, we found that they had dif￾ficulties in communication. The basis for the problems in
'intra-interdisciplinary' [1] research seem to be related to
a great extent to the restriction of scientists to involve

themselves in other fields, thereby loosing the ability to
open their minds towards other scientific branches. To
overcome this problem, the demanding, complex and
interdisciplinary aspects of tissue engineering has to be
approached from new ways.
We have conceptualised Head & Face Medicine therefore as
a thematically broad ranged journal, including all disci￾plines involved in the head and neck area. By publishing
the various aspects of, for example tissue engineering in
one journal the reader can gain an overview of the whole
field. Research papers are intended to provide extended
information for the specialist. On the other hand, we
think that interested readers from other disciplines will be
able to extract the data to an extent, that enable them to
understand the most relevant informations.
To induce a learning curve from the acquisition of frag￾mented, but detailed information, to the ability to criti￾cally overview over the complex field of tissue engineering
is a vision of Head & Face Medicine. We hope this journal
will attract basic researchers and clinicians who are
involved in investigating and applying tissue engineering
in the head and face region and will contribute to a gain
in scientific information, communication, and collabora￾tion in order to improve the outcome of patient treat￾ments.
