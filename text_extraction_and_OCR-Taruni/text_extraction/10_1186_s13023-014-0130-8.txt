Abstract
Methylmalonic and propionic acidemia (MMA/PA) are inborn errors of metabolism characterized by accumulation
of propionic acid and/or methylmalonic acid due to deficiency of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MUT) or propionyl-CoA
carboxylase (PCC). MMA has an estimated incidence of ~ 1: 50,000 and PA of ~ 1:100’000 -150,000. Patients present
either shortly after birth with acute deterioration, metabolic acidosis and hyperammonemia or later at any age with
a more heterogeneous clinical picture, leading to early death or to severe neurological handicap in many survivors.
Mental outcome tends to be worse in PA and late complications include chronic kidney disease almost exclusively in
MMA and cardiomyopathy mainly in PA. Except for vitamin B12 responsive forms of MMA the outcome remains poor
despite the existence of apparently effective therapy with a low protein diet and carnitine. This may be related to under
recognition and delayed diagnosis due to nonspecific clinical presentation and insufficient awareness of health care
professionals because of disease rarity.
These guidelines aim to provide a trans-European consensus to guide practitioners, set standards of care and to help
to raise awareness. To achieve these goals, the guidelines were developed using the SIGN methodology by having
professionals on MMA/PA across twelve European countries and the U.S. gather all the existing evidence, score it
according to the SIGN evidence level system and make a series of conclusive statements supported by an associated
level of evidence. Although the degree of evidence rarely exceeds level C (evidence from non-analytical studies like
case reports and series), the guideline should provide a firm and critical basis to guide practice on both acute and
chronic presentations, and to address diagnosis, management, monitoring, outcomes, and psychosocial and ethical
issues. Furthermore, these guidelines highlight gaps in knowledge that must be filled by future research. We consider
that these guidelines will help to harmonize practice, set common standards and spread good practices, with a positive
impact on the outcomes of MMA/PA patients.

Introduction
Methylmalonic and propionic acidemia (MMA/PA) are
autosomal recessive disorders of propionate catabolism
caused by defects in the enzymes methylmalonyl-CoA
mutase (MUT) or propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC) char￾acterized by accumulation of metabolites of branched￾chain amino acid catabolism such as 3-hydroxypropionic
acid, methylcitric acid and/or methylmalonic acid in plasma,
urine and other body fluids.
Mitochondrial propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC, EC
6.4.1.3) is an α6β6 dodecamer composed of PCCA and
PCCB subunits catalyzing the reversible biotin-dependent
conversion of propionyl-CoA to D-methylmalonyl-CoA.
This is racemised to its L-enantiomer, L-methylmalonyl￾CoA which is reversibly isomerised to succinyl-CoA,
catalyzed by L-methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MUT, EC
5.4.99.2) which requires vitamin B12 (cobalamin) in
the form of adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl) as cofactor
(Figure 1). These reactions represent crucial steps in
propionate catabolism, funneling metabolites from the
breakdown of the amino acids valine, isoleucine, me￾thionine and threonine, odd-chain fatty acids and the side
chain of cholesterol into the tricarboxylic acid cycle. While
mutations in either the PCCA or PCCB gene cause pro￾pionic acidemia (MIM# 606054), isolated methylmalonic
acidemia is caused either by a genetic defect in the MUT
enzyme itself (MIM# 251000, MMA mut type), or in one
of the proteins (MMAA, MMAB, MMADHC) involved
in the synthesis of its active cofactor, adenosylobalamin
(MMA cblA type, MIM# 251100; MMA cblB type, MIM#
251110; MMA cblD-variant 2 MIM# 277410) [1]. The
MUT apoenzyme deficiencies are subdivided into two
subgroups, the mut° defect with virtually undetectable
MUT activity and the mut− defect with low to moderate
residual MUT activity in the presence of high concentra￾tions of AdoCbl. Defects in cobalamin metabolism may
also manifest as combined methylmalonic aciduria and
homocystinuria (cblC, cblD, cblF and cblJ defects) [2,3].
MMA and PA are rare disorders and the true incidence in
Europe is unknown [4]. Estimates of incidence in Western
populations range from 1:48,000 to 1:61,000 births for
MMA [5] and from 1:50,000 to 1:500,000 births for PA.
Overall incidence is believed to be ~ 1: 50,000 for isolated
MMA and ~ 1:100’000 to 150,000 for PA [6]. In some pop￾ulations across the world, the incidence is much higher.
For example, PA incidence in Saudi Arabia is reported to
be much higher at 1 in 2,000 to 5,000 live births [7].
Patients with a complete enzyme deficiency present in
the first days to weeks of life with acute deterioration of
their general clinical condition, metabolic acidosis and
hyperammonemia, progressing to coma and death, if un￾treated. Late-onset cases of MMA and PA may present
at any age, i.e. in infancy, childhood or even later with a
more heterogeneous clinical picture. Mental outcome
tends to be worse in PA and late complications include
chronic kidney disease almost exclusively in MMA and
cardiomyopathy mainly in PA. The overall outcome re￾mains poor despite the existence of apparently effective
therapy with a low protein diet and carnitine except for
vitamin B12-responsive forms of MMA (mainly cblA type
MMA), which have a better outcome if diagnosed timely
and treated adequately. Since prognosis is strongly influenced

by the duration of coma and peak blood ammonia con￾centrations, especially in neonates [8-10], patients must be
identified and adequately treated as soon as possible. In
view of the complexity of the resources required for rapid
diagnosis, efficient timely management and intense moni￾toring of treatment, sufficient experience in the diagnosis
and treatment (including extracorporeal detoxification) of
inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) with supporting la￾boratory resources available 24 h/7 d is essential. However,
the rarity of MMA/PA prevents single centers or even
countries from having all the expertise for evidence-based
management.
Currently, different guidelines for the diagnosis and
treatment of MMA and PA are in place in some European
institutions/countries, but there is no consensus on how
to diagnose and treat patients with suspected or con￾firmed MMA/PA [11]. Therefore the aim of this consen￾sus guideline is to standardize, systematize and harmonize
the diagnosis, therapy and long-term management of
MMA/PA in Europe based on the highest level of evi￾dence, by pooling all the published evidence and experi￾ence of leading centers from several European countries
and the U.S. These guidelines, developed using the SIGN
methodology (Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network,
http://www.sign.ac.uk), are intended for metabolic special￾ists, pediatricians, dietitians, neonatologists, intensive care
specialists, adult physicians, obstetricians, nurses and psy￾chologists involved in the care of MMA/PA patients.
Methodology and objectives
Guideline development
The process leading to this guideline was started at the
annual symposium of the “Society for the Study of
Inborn Errors of Metabolism” (SSIEM) held in Geneva
in August 2011. Three further meetings were held in
Zurich (March 2012), Birmingham (September 2012),
and again in Zurich (January 2013). In the Geneva meet￾ing the guideline development group (GDG) was trained
on methodology to ensure standardized literature evalu￾ation and working groups were established, focusing on
specific guideline topics. Thereafter GDG members per￾formed a systematic literature review, drafted the guideline,
discussed it with all other GDG members in subsequent
meetings, and also discussed the revisions of the guide￾line draft made by external consultants specialized on
neonatology/intensive care (Jochen Meyburg, Heidelberg,
child neurology (B. Plecko-Startinig, Zurich), nephrology
(C.P. Schmitt, Heidelberg), and a patient group representa￾tive (S. Hannigan, London). Furthermore, revisions of the
guideline were made by the GDG based on the judgments
of two highly renowned external reviewers (M. Duran,
Amsterdam, biochemist with specific expertise in organic
acidurias; J. Walter, Manchester, experienced metabolic
pediatrician, editor of the standard text book Inborn
Metabolic Diseases – Diagnosis and Treatment (5th ed.
2012), Springer, Berlin).
The GDG consisted of pediatric metabolic specialists
(D. Ballhausen, M. R. Baumgartner [chairman], A. B. Burlina,
A. Chakrapani [co-chairman], K. Chapman [representing PA
guideline group from USA], C. Dionisi-Vici, S. C. Grünert,
S. Grünewald, F. Hörster [secretary], T. Honzik, D. Karall,
S. Scholl-Bürgi, F. Skovby, V. Valayannopoulos, F. Wijburg),
biochemical geneticists/clinical biochemists (B. Fowler, B.
Merinero, C. Pérez-Cerdá, J. O. Sass), specialist metabolic
dieticians (A. MacDonald, M. Assoun, S. Dubois [Paris], E.
Müller, Heidelberg), pediatric neurologists (G. Haliloglu,
D. Martinelli), a psychologist/metabolic pediatrician
(M. Huemer), and an adult metabolic specialist (M. Hochuli).
The guideline group meetings were supervised by a mod￾erator (M. Summar, Washington) whose role was to over￾see the discussion without directly contributing to the
content of the guideline. The practical applicability of this
guideline has been pilot-tested and supported by 3 pedia￾tricians in training (P. Forny, A. Lämmle, A. Schumann)
who were asked to read it and to provide comments. The
final guideline will be sent to all European societies for in￾born errors of metabolism for endorsement.
Systematic literature review and evidence grading
The methodology used for collecting the evidence base
for this guideline is essentially that used by the Scottish
Intercollegiate Guideline Network (SIGN, http://www.
sign.ac.uk). A systematic literature review on MMA/PA
from the time of description of each disease until
December 2011 was carried out using mainly Medline,
Embase, the Cochrane Library, MedLink, and Orphanet.
A few papers which were published later and were consid￾ered by the group as important were included after that
time point. Searches also included websites of inter￾national and national societies and parent groups for inborn
errors. Relevant papers were evaluated by a minimum of
two members of the GDG before conclusions were consid￾ered as evidence.
Evidence levels were classified in accordance with the
SIGN methodology (Table 1) and recommendations given
in the guideline were graded depending on their level of
evidence (Table 2).
Disclaimer
These guidelines are intended to help decision making in
MMA/PA patient care. Although based on the best avail￾able evidence, the consensus recommendations often only
represent expert opinion and are meant to be followed
flexibly applying own experience and considering the indi￾vidual patient. Guidelines cannot guarantee satisfactory
diagnosis and outcome in every patient. Furthermore, al￾though as exhaustive as possible, these guidelines cannot
include all possible methods of diagnostic work-up and

care and may inadvertently omit some acceptable and
established procedures. Although they should help to
optimize the care of individual patients and assist de￾cision making by basing clinical practice on scientific
and medical knowledge the guidelines should not sub￾stitute well-informed, prudent clinical practice.
Diagnosis (and differential diagnosis)
Clinical signs and symptoms - conditions raising the
suspicion of MMA/PA
Clinical signs and symptoms of MMA/PA are nonspecific.
Patients may present with acute or chronic symptoms at
any age (Table 3). Some of the signs and symptoms are
common, others are uncommon and a few are only de￾scribed in single cases.
In the classical, neonatal onset form of MMA/PA, symp￾toms start as early as the second day of life with acute
deterioration of the general clinical condition, vomiting,
dehydration, weight loss, temperature instability, neuro￾logical involvement with muscular hypo- or hypertonia,
irritability, lethargy progressing to coma and seizures
(Table 3). At presentation, laboratory findings include se￾vere and persistent metabolic acidosis and ketosis, ele￾vated anion gap and hyperammonemia. As in any sick
newborn, sepsis and other more common conditions such
as birth trauma, gastrointestinal obstruction, and cardiore￾spiratory difficulties should be excluded [7,12,13].
Statement #1: Grade of recommendation C In new￾borns with clinical distress and/or suspicion of sepsis or￾ganic acidemias must be considered in the differential
diagnosis from the outset (see Tables 3 and 4 and section
on laboratory diagnosis).
After the neonatal period, symptoms of MMA/PA may
vary considerably and affect different organ systems such
as the nervous system, gastrointestinal tract, immune
system, heart (mainly in PA) and kidney (mainly in
MMA). Importantly, metabolic crises are frequently trig￾gered by catabolic events, protein overload or certain
drugs. Symptoms may also mimic other more common
conditions such as diabetic ketoacidosis with hypergly￾cemia [15-19] or Reye syndrome [20]. Common nonspe￾cific symptoms/conditions include encephalopathy or
unexplained coma [21-23], failure to thrive [21-33], mus￾cular hypotonia [21-23,27,30,34], epilepsy [13,23-28,35],
neuropsychiatric symptoms [36,37], cardiomyopathy and
prolonged QTc interval (the latter only in PA) [21,38-45],
and progressive renal insufficiency [25,26,46-54].
Statement #2: Grade of recommendation C After the
neonatal period, the clinical presentation of MMA/PA
may mimic other more common conditions. Affected sys￾tems are (see Table 3):
 Gastrointestinal tract: recurrent vomiting with
ketoacidosis, abnormal feeding behavior, failure to
thrive, constipation, pancreatitis.
 Nervous system: acute encephalopathy, hypotonia,
seizures, developmental delay, movement disorders/
stroke-like events, psychiatric symptoms.
 Hematologic findings: neutropenia, involvement of
bone marrow.
 Heart: cardiomyopathy, prolonged QTc interval
(mainly in PA).
 Kidney: chronic renal failure in MMA.
Published reports on the natural history of MMA/PA do
not usually differentiate between clinical presentation
leading to the diagnosis and symptoms appearing during
the course of the disease. The frequency of different signs
and symptoms are listed in Table 5. It must be noted that
some rare symptoms may be over represented and some
common symptoms under-represented in the literature
implying a significant publication bias.

Statement #3: Grade of recommendation C Rare(r)
clinical symptoms or manifestations of MMA and PA as a
single (presenting) symptom or in combination with other
symptoms have been described. They should be consid￾ered in the diagnosis of MMA/PA and must be considered
in the follow-up and monitoring of previously diagnosed
patients.
A careful medical and family history is mandatory and
should include questions about unexplained neonatal
deaths or neurological disorders in the family, consan￾guinity, evidence of protein avoidance in the patient and
siblings, and drug intake by the patient.
Laboratory findings
Baseline laboratory tests raising suspicion of MMA or PA
MMA and PA should be considered in any newborn/
child (whether critically ill or not) with unexplained
– Metabolic acidosis (with elevated anion gap)
– Elevated lactate
– Hyperammonemia
– Leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia [27] and/or
– Urine ketone bodies (acetoacetate, dipstick) [80]
Statement #4: Grade of recommendation C Metabolic
acidosis (with elevated anion gap), elevated lactate, hyper￾ammonemia, elevated urinary ketone bodies (in particular
in newborns) are laboratory hallmarks of MMA and PA
and therefore should be investigated in any critically ill pa￾tient or unexplained condition.
If hyperammonemia is present, determination of plasma
amino acids, blood or plasma acylcarnitines and urinary
organic acids and orotic acid should be urgently requested
together with basic laboratory investigations. Treatment
must be commenced immediately on presentation without

waiting for these results, which must be available within
24 hours. When samples are taken after recovery from an
acute episode, urinary organic acids may be especially
helpful for diagnosis. In patients with a fatal outcome, a
skin biopsy is recommended for the establishment of cul￾tured fibroblasts, along with anticoagulated blood for DNA
isolation/immortalization of lymphocytes and stored fro￾zen aliquots of plasma, serum and urine [81].

generally differentiate between hyperammonemia due to
inborn errors and that due to other conditions such as liver
failure. Table 4 lists inborn errors of metabolism leading to
acute deterioration with encephalopathy and hyperammo￾nemia guiding bedside differential diagnosis (for further
reading see also [14]). Metabolic acidosis, elevation of
lactate and anion gap, and disturbances of glucose me￾tabolism may help to differentiate MMA/PA from other
disorders presenting with acute deterioration and enceph￾alopathy. Lack of megaloblastic anemia with increased
MCV and elevated plasma homocysteine differentiates
from vitamin B12 deficiency and disorders of intracellular
cobalamin metabolism.
Specialized biochemical investigations
Subsequent investigations include determination of organic
acids in urine, amino acids in blood (plasma, drawn ideally
after 3-4 hours fasting), urine and CSF, acylcarnitine profile
in blood (dried blood or plasma) and total plasma homo￾cysteine which is essential in order to differentiate the vari￾ous types of MMA [1]. Methylmalonic acid is not elevated
in PA and thus allows distinction between MMA and PA
[1] using urinary organic acid analysis. While methylcitrate
and 3-hydroxypropionic acid are present in both disorders,
N-propionylglycine, N-tiglylglycine, 2-methyl-3-oxovaleric
acid, 3-hydroxy-2-methylbutyric acid, 2-methyl-3-oxobutyric
acid, 3-hydroxy-n-valeric acid, 3-oxo-n-valeric acid, are
detectable in PA only [18,27]. In the acylcarnitine profile
propionylcarnitine (C3) is elevated [34,82], but this is not
specific and does not help to differentiate between MMA
and PA [34]; elevated methylmalonylcarnitine (an isomer
of C4DC) can be found in MMA [83,84]. Amino acid ana￾lysis usually shows elevated glycine and lysine concentra￾tions in blood, urine [27] and CSF, but normal glycine
CSF/plasma ratio [35]. Determination of odd numbered
long-chain fatty acids (OLCFA) in erythrocyte membranes
[85,86] or plasma [87,88] is an additional diagnostic
aid but is not routinely used and only performed in few
laboratories.
Statement #6: Grade of recommendation B-C Deter￾mination of organic acids in urine and the acylcarnitine
profile in blood are the most commonly used investiga￾tions to detect MMA and PA. Determination of amino
acid concentrations may help in diagnosis and treat￾ment. In addition total plasma homocysteine allows dif￾ferentiation between the various types of MMA.
Confirmation of diagnosis by enzyme and molecular
genetic investigations
The complexity of inherited isolated MMA/PA usually re￾quires characterization of the underlying defect in cultured
skin fibroblasts and/or lymphocytes and/or molecular gen￾etic analysis. A favored approach is initial measurement of
the overall conversion of propionate to succinate by the in￾corporation of label from [14C] propionate into cell pro￾teins in normal and vitamin B12 supplemented medium
[89]. For MMA the ratio of activity in B12-supplemented
versus unsupplemented medium can allow distinction of
mut° and some cases of cblB (ratio below 1.5) from mut−
and cblA (ratio higher than 1.5) [90]. Measurement of
specific activity of MMCoA mutase in the presence and
absence of Ado-Cbl [91] is needed in cases that remain
unclear. This approach allows selection of the appropriate
gene for mutation analysis. In some cases such as a known
mutation in a family member or common mutation in a
particular population this approach may be rationalized by
early or direct performance of mutation analysis.
For PA, assay of PCC in lymphocytes and/or cultured fi￾broblasts is the more reliable and rapid (in lymphocytes)
method to confirm the disease. Either complementation
or mutation analysis confirms the genetic defect which is
essential to offer prenatal diagnosis to the families.
Statement #7: Grade of recommendation B/D Enzym￾atic studies and/or molecular genetic analyses should be
performed to confirm diagnosis (B). This is ideally done
in specialized laboratories (D).
For MMA, knowledge of the underlying enzymatic de￾fect [25,92] and the underlying genotype (mut0
, mut−
,
cblA, cblB or cblD-variant 2) [1,87,90,93-95] is of great
importance since residual enzyme activity and vitamin
B12-reponsiveness influences the clinical course and can
be associated with a better long term outcome.
The spectrum of genetic defects and the range of
causative mutations are different in different populations
of MMA [90,95-97] and PA patients [32,94,97-102]. A few
common mutations are found in each defect; however,
most mutations are private. The identification of disease￾causing mutations facilitates accurate prenatal diagnosis,
determination of carrier status for family members, gen￾etic counseling and in some cases genotype-phenotype
correlations [48,90,94,95,103].
Statement #8: Grade of recommendation C-D Defects
in different genes can cause isolated methylmalonic acid￾uria. The clinical phenotype is influenced by the underlying
enzymatic defect (mut0
, mut−
, cblB, cblA and cblD-variant 2)
and genotype (mut, MMAA, MMAB, MMADHC).
Statement #9: Grade of recommendation B No clear￾cut genotype-phenotype correlations have been found
in PA.
Prenatal testing
Prenatal testing in both diseases is feasible. Prior to test￾ing, it is desirable that the index case has been confirmed
biochemically and/or genetically, and the carrier status of

http://www.ojrd.com/content/9/1/130

the parents has been confirmed by mutation analysis
[104,105]. Mutation analysis in fetal DNA is the method
of choice. To improve reliability or if mutation analysis of
the index case is not available additional tests may be car￾ried out including determination of metabolites in amni￾otic fluid (methylcitrate and/or propionylcarnitine in PA;
methylmalonic acid/methylcitrate in amniotic fluid or am￾niotic fluid dried on filter paper in MMA) [106] or activity
assay in amniocytes or intact native or cultured chorion
villi. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) has been
reported as a reproductive option for couples affected
with PA [107].
Statement #10: Grade of recommendation D Prenatal
testing in both diseases is feasible. Prior to testing, it is desir￾able that the index case has been confirmed biochemically
and/or genetically, and the carrier status of the parents has
been confirmed by mutation analysis.
Newborn screening (NBS)
Newborn screening for MMA and PA is technically feas￾ible using propionylcarnitine and methionine and has
been implemented in some countries (e.g. Austria, U.S,
Spain, Italy), but not in others (e.g., Germany, France, U.K,
Netherlands). Because both markers lack disease specifi￾city, several attempts using analyte ratios and 2nd tier test￾ing have been undertaken to differentiate between false
and true positives [34,108-110] but so far yielded conflict￾ing results in patient studies [111,112]. Promising results
regarding false-positive rate and positive predictive value
were obtained in a study using a 2nd tier method for the
detection of total homocysteine, methylmalonic acid and
methylcitrate [113].
The most comprehensive study investigated 55 PA pa￾tients 20 of which were diagnosed via newborn screening
[21]. 63% of the newborn screening patients were already
symptomatic at the time of diagnosis. The authors con￾clude that early diagnosis of PA through newborn screen￾ing seems to be associated with a lower mortality rate.
However, no significant benefit could be shown for surviv￾ing patients with regard to their clinical course, including
the number of metabolic crises, physical and neurocogni￾tive development, and long-term complications [21,22].
Statement #11: Grade of recommendation C-D New￾born screening for MMA and PA is technically feasible.
So far available data about outcome has not answered the
question as to whether newborn screening in MMA/PA is
of long-term clinical benefit.
Acute management
Initial management
Since the long-term neurodevelopmental outcome is
strongly influenced by the duration of coma and peak
blood ammonia concentrations [114-116], therapy must
not be delayed and therefore the diagnostic workup and the
initial medical treatment should proceed simultaneously:
1) Stabilize the patient.
2) Stop protein intake.
3) Start intravenous glucose.
4) Seek expert metabolic advice.
5) Initiate first-line treatment as outlined in Table 6.
6) Collect samples (blood spot, plasma and urine) for
diagnostic purposes.
While waiting for the laboratory diagnosis, treatment
should be started without delay with medications as out￾lined in Table 7.
Statement #12: Grade of recommendation C-D One
of the most severe life threatening events in MMA and
PA is hyperammonemia. The acute management differs
depending on whether the cause of hyperammonemia is
known or not. The differential diagnosis should include
urea cycle defects and some other inherited disorders
(see Table 4). The start of ammonia detoxification and
measures to reverse catabolism must not be delayed.
Medications and rationale in acute hyperammonemia
Table 7 gives an overview of drugs to be administered in
a patient with acute hyperammonemia. It reflects the
consensus of this guideline working group and is sup￾ported by several publications (see Häberle et al. (2012)
for review [14]).
L-carnitine is given to compensate for secondary carni￾tine deficiency caused by urinary loss of carnitine-bound
to organic acids. L-carnitine therapy is considered safe.
Ammonia scavengers are drugs that allow bypassing of
the urea cycle, by conjugation of benzoate with glycine
to generate hippurate, and of phenylacetate (phenylbuty￾rate is the precursor of phenylacetate) with glutamine to
generate phenylacetylglutamine. The use of ammonia
scavengers, which represents the mainstay of therapy for
detoxification of ammonia in urea cycle defects, is still de￾bated in MMA and PA as there is the theoretical risk of
increasing intramitochondrial accumulation of CoA esters
and of further depleting free CoA availability [4,117-119].
However, sodium benzoate has been reported to be safe
and efficacious to treat hyperammonemia [120] and many
metabolic centers regularly use this drug in organic acid￾urias. The use of sodium phenylbutyrate in MMA and PA
raises further concern because in these diseases hyperam￾monemia is usually associated with decreased levels of
glutamine, because the mechanism producing hyperam￾monemia differs from urea cycle defects. Due to the risk
of further depletion of the glutamine/glutamate pool, the
routine use of sodium phenylbutyrate or phenylacetate to
Baumgartner et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases 2014, 9:130 Page 8 of 36
http://www.ojrd.com/content/9/1/130

treat hyperammonemia should be considered with ex￾treme caution in MMA and PA [117-119]. Once the diag￾nosis of organic acidemia is established, phenylbutyrate/
acetate should be discontinued [9].
Arginine administration aims at maximizing ammonia
excretion through the urea cycle. After the diagnosis of
MMA or PA is confirmed L-arginine treatment can be dis￾continued but arginine levels should still be monitored.
Vitamin B12 responsiveness should be systematically
tested but is more likely in late-onset MMA forms than
in patients presenting in the newborn period. Vitamin
B12, the cofactor precursor of methylmalonyl-CoA mu￾tase, should be tried in all suspected cases by giving 1mg
hydroxocobalamin i.m. (for more details see [1]; cyano￾cobalamin is less efficient but may be used temporarily
until OHCbl is available). Biotin is the treatment of
choice in both holocarboxylase synthetase (HCS) and bi￾otinidase deficiency while there are doubts whether biotin￾responsive forms of PA truly exist.
N-Carbamylglutamate is an analogue of N-acetylglutamate
that allosterically activates carbamylphosphate synthetase
I in the urea cycle. This drug has been utilized in MMA and
PA for its ability to antagonize propionyl-CoA induced hyper￾ammonemia. The dose selection of N-carbamylglutamate,
which is so far only available as an oral medication, differs
in the literature [4,9,10,16,121-128]; we recommend to use
the doses as suggested by Häberle et al. (2012) [14].
Statement #13: Grade of recommendation C-D Initial
management includes stopping protein intake and starting
intravenous glucose. Combined treatment including par￾enteral L-carnitine, hydroxocobalamin, sodium benzoate,
L-arginine, and oral biotin and N-carbamylglutamate
should be given while waiting for the laboratory diagnosis.
In diagnosed PA patients the continuation of biotin treat￾ment is questionable because there are doubts whether
biotin-responsive forms of PA truly exist.
Promotion of anabolism
The aim is to prevent endogenous catabolism, in particu￾lar protein catabolism, whilst providing enough energy to
meet metabolic demands [129]. Intravenous fluids con￾taining 10% glucose or higher concentration should be in￾fused according to the patient’s age (Table 8). Insulin can
be carefully used to promote anabolism while maintaining
normoglycemia [4,9,130]. Patients on insulin and high glu￾cose infusion should be monitored for increases of lactic
acid due to a potential interference with Krebs cycle entry

and inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase by toxic metabo￾lites [127]. The dose of insulin, starting from 0.01-0.02
units/kg/h, must be adjusted frequently in order to control
glycemia. Sustained normalization of blood glucose levels,
which is an indirect marker of effective anabolism, allows
insulin withdrawal. Caution in the use of insulin is recom￾mended when lactic acidosis is present (plasma lactate >5
mmol/L). Lipid emulsion should be commenced early to
provide additional calories at a dose of up to 2 g/kg/day.
Platelets and triglycerides should be monitored during lipid
treatment.
Following improvement of metabolic and clinical ab￾normalities, natural protein preferably, should be rein￾troduced rapidly with the aim of meeting safe levels of
protein intake (FAO/WHO/UNU 2007) and not with￾held more than 24(-48) hours. Enteral feeding should be
started as soon as the clinical condition allows.
Statement #14: Grade of recommendation C-D To re￾verse endogenous catabolism, in particular protein ca￾tabolism, it is necessary to provide enough energy to
meet the metabolic demands. Intravenous fluids contain￾ing glucose should be infused and insulin may be used
to promote anabolism; after exclusion of a fatty acid oxi￾dation disorder lipid emulsion should be commenced early
to provide additional calories. Following improvement of
metabolic and clinical abnormalities, protein should be
rapidly reintroduced. Enteral feeding should be started as
soon as possible.
Parenteral nutrition
Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is the method of choice
in infants with severe illness. An amino acid free parenteral
solution is suitable for the first 24-48 h but protein
must then be added using commercially available stand￾ard amino acid-solutions (containing essential and non￾esential amino acids) [117]. NaCl and KCl should be
progressively decreased to 2 g/l and 1.5 g/l, respectively
[117]. Initially, amino acids are introduced in an amount
sufficient to meet the age dependent safe levels of protein
intake (FAO/WHO/UNU 2007), and then titrated accord￾ing to biochemical monitoring of amino acids (see section
on metabolic follow-up and monitoring). The minimal
isoleucine requirement in neonates is at least equal to that
of valine, but many i.v. amino acid solutions provide less
of the former than the latter. Consequently, when the
TPN solution only provides the minimal requirement for
L-valine, additional oral supplementation of L-isoleucine
(25–100 mg/day) is often necessary. Vitamins, minerals
and micronutrients must always be provided to prevent
selective deficiencies.
Statement #15: Grade of recommendation D Paren￾teral nutrition is indicated, when enteral feeding cannot be
established within 24-48 h. Amino acids are gradually in￾troduced to meet safe levels of protein intake (see section
on dietary treatment). An additional oral supplementation
of L-isoleucine is often necessary. Vitamins, minerals and
micronutrients must always be provided to prevent select￾ive deficiencies.
Extracorporeal detoxification
Extracorporeal detoxification should be started in neonates
and children who have blood ammonia levels >400-500
μmol/l, or if there is an inadequate response to medical
therapy after 3-6 hours (this is the estimated time needed
for preparing dialysis, including vascular access [8-10]). In
late childhood or in adults, given the high susceptibility to
developing severe brain edema, dialysis should be started
earlier, i.e. if ammonia exceeds 200 μmol/l [14].
Statement #16: Grade of recommendation C-D Extra￾corporeal detoxification is commonly used in severely
decompensated patients. Persistent hyperammonemia,
metabolic acidosis and severe electrolyte imbalances are
indications for extracorporeal detoxification. Extracor￾poreal detoxification should be considered and prepar￾ation started in neonates and children who have blood
ammonia levels >400-500 μmol/l. In late childhood or in
adults dialysis should be considered even at lower am￾monia levels.
The method of choice for extracorporeal detoxification in
neonates and infants is continuous veno-venous hemodia￾filtration (CVVHDF) [8,10]. In adults, either CVVHDF or
hemodialysis (HD) are recommended. CVVHDF is a con￾tinuous procedure with excellent ammonia clearance and is
usually well tolerated in infants. HD is an intermittent tech￾nique and provides the highest ammonia extraction, but its
use in infants can cause severe technical and hemodynamic
complications. In centers with less experience in extracor￾poreal detoxification, peritoneal dialysis can be utilized as
first line intervention. However, its use is less effective in
the acute setting compared with CVVHDF and HD [8].
The start of extracorporeal detoxification must not be
delayed unless a decision for withdrawal of treatment and
for palliative care is made.
Statement #17: Grade of recommendation C-D The
method of choice for extracorporeal detoxification in ne￾onates and infants is continuous veno-venous hemodia￾filtration (CVVHDF). In adults, both CVVHDF and
hemodialysis (HD) are recommended. The mode of
dialysis should be adjusted to the local experience and

facilities. Whenever possible patients should be transferred
to qualified centers.
General critical care management
The severity of metabolic decompensation does not de￾pend on hyperammonemia alone but also other factors
have to be taken into account, monitored and treated ac￾cordingly. Neonates and infants with organic acidurias
and severe ketoacidosis present with intracellular dehy￾dration that is often underestimated. In this situation,
aggressive rehydration with hypotonic fluids and alkali￾zation may cause or exacerbate pre-existing cerebral
edema. Therefore, rehydration should be planned over a
48-h period, with a fluid infusion of about 150 ml/kg/24 h
[117]. Acidosis can be cautiously corrected with i.v. bicar￾bonate, especially if it does not improve with the first mea￾sures of toxin removal. However, aggressive therapy with
repeated boluses of i.v. bicarbonate may induce hyperna￾tremia, cerebral edema, and even cerebral hemorrhage.
Proposal of a precise dosage and timing of bicarbonate
therapy is inappropriate since patients in metabolic crisis
often present with severe blood electrolyte and osmolar
abnormalities whose correction is managed by intensive
care physicians. Furthermore, there are no criteria which
define the degree of decompensation by clinical and la￾boratory parameters as severe, moderate, or mild in an or￾ganic aciduria. The severity of acidosis (pH ≤ 7.1) and level
of ammonia (≥400/500 μmol/L) have been considered as
the main discriminating variables, but other laboratory
values (e.g. blood glucose, electrolyte and trace element
levels, blood osmolarity, liver and kidney function, etc.) or
clinical findings (e.g. degree of dehydration, cardiac and
hemodynamic status, presence of pancreatitis, severity of
the neurological picture) may contribute to an overall as￾sessment of the level of severity. The supportive measures
are applied in parallel to the procedure for toxin removal
that, in addition to the dialysis of the toxic organic acids,
can compensate for some of the fluid and electrolyte im￾balance and allow for nutritional support.
Statement #18: Grade of recommendation D Neonates
and infants with organic acidurias and severe ketoacido￾sis present with intracellular dehydration that is often
underestimated. Therefore adequate rehydration is es￾sential. However, over aggressive hydration and alkalini￾sation may cause or exacerbate cerebral edema.
Additional treatments (under metabolic expert guidance)
In MMA, forced diuresis and alkalinisation of urine with
sodium bicarbonate may help to eliminate methylmalo￾nic acid due to its high renal clearance.
Glutathione deficiency and oxoprolinuria have been
reported in a decompensated patient with MMA [131]
and in another case high-dose ascorbate therapy (120
mg/kg/day) was effective in reducing lactic acidosis and
oxoprolinuria [132].
Metabolic decompensation may be complicated by se￾vere lactic acidosis due to thiamine deficiency, requiring
vitamin supplementation.
No data exist in literature about neuroprotection in
acute management in MMA/PA patients. Hypothermia,
anti-inflammatory agents and NMDA receptor blockers
are now routinely used as a neuroprotective strategy in
several emergency conditions and their use in MMA
and PA needs exploration [133].
Statement #19: Grade of recommendation C-D In
MMA, forced diuresis and alkalinisation of urine with
sodium bicarbonate may help to eliminate methylmalo￾nic acid. No data exist in the literature about neuropro￾tection in acute management in MMA/PA patients.
Acute decompensation in known patients with MMA/PA
In MMA and PA, the aim is to stabilize patients on a diet
that maintains metabolic homeostasis whilst allowing nor￾mal growth and development. Episodes of catabolic stress
are associated with rapid production and accumulation
of toxic metabolites which can cause decompensation,
and lead to life threatening complications. Table 9 shows
the triggers, clinical signs & symptoms and common bio￾chemical signs of acute decompensation in MMA/PA.
Triggers of acute decompensation include any circum￾stances inducing catabolism. It is important to recognize
the signs and symptoms that indicate the need for intensi￾fication of therapy in order to prevent serious complica￾tions. The presence of any one or more of such clinical
signs and symptoms compared to the individual patient’s
base line should trigger further evaluation and potential
adjustment of therapy and monitoring in order to prevent
complications.
Statement #20: Grade of recommendation D The
presence of any one or more of the clinical or biochem￾ical signs listed in Table 9 compared to the individual
patient’s baseline should trigger further evaluation and
potential adjustment of therapy and monitoring in order
to prevent complications.
It must also be noted that there are a few well￾documented cases of complications (such as basal ganglia
damage) following acute illnesses without biochemical
disturbances. Therefore, any intercurrent illness in MMA
and PA must be treated as a potential trigger for serious
and potentially fatal complications regardless of additional
signs and symptoms.
Statement #21: Grade of recommendation D Any
acute intercurrent illness must prompt closer monitor￾ing and evaluation.

For emergency management in the hospital see Tables 6,
7 and 8 above.
Indications and courses for intravenous fluid therapy
The purpose of IV fluid therapy is to provide sufficient
calories to reverse or prevent catabolism as well as fluids
and electrolytes when enteral feeding is not possible.
Initial IV therapy with 10% glucose with added elec￾trolytes does not contain protein and the caloric in￾take provided is insufficient to maintain homeostasis in
the long term. Therefore, IV fluids therapy with glucose
and electrolytes should not be used for more than 24-48
hours. If enteral protein-containing feeds cannot be rein￾troduced within this time, parenteral nutrition should be
commenced.
Indications for IV fluid therapy in the acute setting
may include:
– Any acute presentation with vomiting
– Intolerance of emergency diet given enterally
– Refusal of feeds if nasogastric feeds or gastrostomy
are not available/possible
– Suspected pancreatitis or gut pathology
– Prospective management of surgery
– Post operatively during reintroduction of feeds
Some patients require a central line to maintain ad￾equate access during illness; this needs to be carefully
weighed against the risk of infection. In the only report
available on individuals with central lines, all three re￾quired removal for infection [134].
Statement #22: Grade of recommendation D Because
of the risk of infection, determination of the need for
central lines should be approached with caution and on
a patient to patient basis.
Nutritional composition of home emergency feeds
During mild illness and without gastrointestinal symptoms,
energy intake is often suboptimal and resting energy ex￾penditure may be increased by 30% to 40% during acute
decompensation [135]. To prevent acute decompensation
home enteral emergency feeding is appropriate. The aim is
to provide adequate energy to meet increased metabolic de￾mands and to prevent endogenous protein catabolism.
Table 10 gives the nutrient composition of an emergency
feed regimen based on a glucose polymer (±long chain fat;
note that fat tolerance may be poor during illness) for pa￾tients with MMA and PA. It may be necessary to adminis￾ter suitable enteral feeds continuously via a gastrostomy or
nasogastric feeding tube to ensure feed tolerance. Care￾givers require appropriate training to conduct this [136].
The minimum amount of energy required to reverse catab￾olism varies between individual patients and according to
the severity of the illness. Pre-measured sachets of emer￾gency glucose polymer have been shown to improve reli￾ability of emergency feed preparation [137]. It is commonly
advocated to temporarily stop or reduce natural protein
intake but this should be for minimal duration only, and
reintroduced within 24(-48) hours to prevent potential ca￾tabolism from protein deficiency. The role of MMA/PA
precursor-free amino acids during acute management is
controversial; it is thought that they may help to minimize
catabolism. However, MMA/PA precursor-free amino acids
will also increase the feed osmolarity, thereby potentially in￾creasing emergency feed intolerance; moreover, they should
be avoided with hyperammonemia (Table 10).
Additional water is required particularly during inter￾mittent febrile illnesses and with increased stool losses.
In MMA, dehydration with loss of sodium and potas￾sium is a common problem particularly in the presence
of renal disease and polyuria. Renal function commonly
deteriorates during acute decompensation. Fluid and elec￾trolyte intake require careful management.

Caregivers should not commence an emergency feed
without consultation with the inherited metabolic disease
(IMD) team. Because the clinical condition may rapidly de￾teriorate, caregivers require regular contact with the IMD
team for assessment of symptoms, energy and fluid intake.
For vomiting, diarrhea or any signs of clinical deterior￾ation, patients should be assessed and treated in hospital
(see above). Prolonged and frequent use of emergency
feeds may lead to protein deficiency.
Statement #23: Grade of recommendation D During
mild illness and without gastrointestinal symptoms, home
enteral emergency feeding management is appropriate.
There should be provision of adequate energy to meet in￾creased metabolic demands and prevent endogenous pro￾tein catabolism. Regular review should be conducted by
the inherited metabolic disease team.
Treatment of fever
Since fever is one of the main factors that can trigger a
metabolic decompensation, it is essential to start imme￾diate treatment with antipyretics (e.g. paracetamol, ibu￾profen) when body temperature exceeds 38°C.
Laboratory investigations to guide acute treatment
Acute treatment is mainly based on commonly available la￾boratory investigations. Ammonia, acid-base balance and
anion-gap are important biochemical parameters that may
help to identify an impending metabolic decompensation
[138]. Other tests should include urine ketones, glucose,
electrolytes (Na, K, Cl, phosphate and HCO3), lactate, cre￾atinine, urea, uric acid, albumin, amylase and lipase, and
blood cell count. Since these patients are often immuno￾compromised, blood cultures and CRP should be consid￾ered. Specific laboratory investigations include amino acids
in plasma/serum to evaluate nutritional supplementa￾tion. Additional tests (organic acids, namely methylmalo￾nic acid, propionylcarnitine and free carnitine) are of little
benefit in acute management, provided that the diagnosis
is already established.
Statement #24: Grade of recommendation D Specific
investigations beyond routine tests and amino acids in
plasma/serum are of limited help in guiding acute treat￾ment, provided that the diagnosis is already established.
Statement #25: Grade of recommendation D Unless
the confirmation of the diagnosis with MMA/PA is still
pending, no banking of samples during acute treatment

The goals of long-term management are to achieve nor￾mal development and to prevent episodes of metabolic de￾compensation, whilst providing good quality of life and
avoiding side-effects and complications [139]. Standard
therapy includes:
 L-carnitine
 antibiotics to reduce intestinal flora
 vitamin B12 in responsive MMA patients
 low-protein diet
 precursor-free amino acid and/or isoleucine/valine
supplementation
 vitamin and mineral supplementation
 caring for special situations and provision of
emergency regimen in intercurrent illnesses
A detailed, written day to day treatment plan and emer￾gency regimen (see home emergency feeds above), includ￾ing instructions on when and how to contact the metabolic
team or the local hospital should be given to parents/
caregivers and to the child’s nursery or school.

in long-term treatment of MMA/PA are L-carnitine, an￾tibiotics to reduce intestinal flora and vitamin B12.
Statement #27: Grade of Recommendation D Regular
follow-up visits to the general pediatrician are recom￾mended. Patients with MMA/PA should receive all regu￾lar vaccinations including vaccinations against influenza
and rotavirus. Early antipyretic treatment (>38°C) should
be given.
Pharmacotherapy for long-term treatment
L-carnitine enhances propionyl group elimination [140],
regenerates CoA and transforms toxic CoA esters into
less toxic carnitine esters [141] that can be eliminated in
urine [142-144]. Supplementation restores plasma carni￾tine levels [42,145]. L-carnitine seems to contribute to
the reduction of hyperammonemia in PA patients [118]
and demonstrates antioxidant capacity [146]. It is a well￾tolerated treatment with few side effects including tran￾sient nausea and vomiting, abdominal cramps, diarrhea,
fishy body odor. No risks related to high levels of free
and total carnitine have been reported. The recom￾mended doses for L-carnitine vary from 100 to 300 mg/
kg/d [4,11,121,139]. It is recommended that plasma free
and total carnitine levels be regularly monitored to as￾sess compliance and to optimize doses.
Statement #28: Grade of recommendation C-D L￾carnitine (100-200 mg/kg/d in 2-4 doses) is useful in the
long-term treatment of patients with MMA and PA.
Doses should be adapted according to clinical response
and carnitine levels.
Metronidazole greatly reduces the production of propionyl￾CoA derived from anaerobic bacterial fermentation of car￾bohydrates in the gut, which may account for a large pro￾portion of total body propionate [147,148]. Intermittent
courses of metronidazole may be as effective as continu￾ous treatment [149,150]. Metronidazole, 10–20 mg/kg/
day divided in 2-3 times alone or alternating with other
antibiotics (e.g. amoxicillin or cotrimoxazole) should be
used [4,121,139,151]. In order to avoid the development of
drug-resistant colonies, 1-2 weeks of therapy alternating
with 2-3 weeks off or alternating every month is advisable.
It may be useful to supplement probiotics (avoiding those
containing propionic acid producing bacteria) to restore
and balance intestinal flora.
Statement #29: Grade of recommendation C-D The
use of oral antibiotics continuously or intermittently to
control intestinal propionic acid producing bacteria is use￾ful in patients with MMA/PA. The most frequent dosing
schemes use metronidazole (10–20 mg/kg/d in 2-3 doses)
for 1-2 weeks alternating with 2-3 weeks off or alternating
every month with other antibiotics.
In MMA, long-term prognosis correlates with vitamin
B12 (cobalamin) responsiveness [25,26,92], which has al￾ways been found in cblA patients, less commonly in cblB
and mut− patients and almost never in mut° patients.
Every patient should be tested carefully using a stan￾dardized protocol [1] to avoid misclassification of pa￾tients with a mild response such as some cblB patients
[25]. Hydroxocobalamin is preferred over cyanocobala￾min [1,11]. Doses range from 1 to 14 mg/week (IM or
IV) and 5 to 21 mg/wk (oral). Parenteral treatment
should be tried first followed by combined parenteral/
enteral treatment or oral-only treatment depending upon
the biochemical response.
Statement #30: Grade of recommendation C-D Re￾sponse to vitamin B12 should be assessed in every MMA
patient. For responders hydroxocobalamin should be used
as long-term treatment. Doses of hydroxocobalamin have
to be tailored individually depending on the clinical and
biochemical results.
Growth Hormone (GH) therapy has been used in pa￾tients with MMA/PA showing clinical and biochemical im￾provement, probably due to an anabolic effect [47,74,152].
However the effect appears to be lost at higher dosage. GH
may also be of benefit in the treatment of chronic kidney
disease in MMA, although no specific studies are available.
A lipolytic effect is also seen but seems not to be detrimen￾tal on metabolite excretion [153].
Statement #31: Grade of recommendation C-D
Growth hormone (GH) has been used in patients with
MMA/PA displaying severe growth retardation associ￾ated with an abnormal response to GH stimulation tests.
Careful monitoring of metabolic parameters under GH
therapy is required due to its potential lipolytic effects.
Among the ammonia scavengers, sodium benzoate (150-
250 mg/kg per day) has been used for the long-term treat￾ment of chronic hyperammonemia in MMA/PA patients
[139,154]. There is no clear evidence of the benefits of this
therapy in the chronic setting. Sodium-phenylbutyrate is
not advisable because it lowers the glutamine/glutamate
ratio. N-Carbamylglutamate was shown to enhance urea
genesis in patients with PA suggesting a potential role in
treating hyperammonemia in PA patients [155]. However
there is no clinical evidence for long-term use of this ther￾apy in MMA/PA.
Statement #32: Grade of recommendation C-D Chronic
hyperammonemia indicates metabolic imbalance and re￾quires investigation and treatment of the underlying
cause. Sodium benzoate has been used to treat long￾term hyperammonemia in MMA/PA patients.

Drugs to be avoided
Steroids administered by a systemic route should only be
used in emergency situations in patients with MMA/PA
due to their catabolic effects on the muscle. However, in
exceptional cases such as West syndrome, the manage￾ment of MMA with concurrent steroid therapy is possible
and beneficial [156]. Inhaled steroids are devoid of cata￾bolic effects and seem safe for MMA/PA patients.
Statement #33: Grade of recommendation D Steroids
administered by a systemic route should be avoided if
possible, or if unavoidable, should be used with caution.
Inhaled steroids seem safe.
Contraindicated drugs
Drugs containing pivalic acid (antibiotic) and valproate
decrease L-carnitine concentration in plasma and tissues
by urinary excretion of acylcarnitine as pivaloylcarnitine
and valproylcarnitine respectively [157]. Sodium valpro￾ate should be used with great caution due to its interfer￾ence with intermediary metabolism unless there are no
other antiepileptic drug alternatives. Nephrotoxic drugs
should be avoided in patients with MMA due to their
potential to precipitate or aggravate renal disease. Im￾munosuppressive drugs (e.g. cyclophosphamide) should
be used with caution. Medications known to prolong
the QTc-interval (such as prokinetic drugs) should be
avoided if possible.
Statement #34: Grade of recommendation D Drugs
containing propionate, valproate, pivalic acid, nephro￾toxic drugs and chemotherapy agents should be avoided
or used with great caution in patients with MMA/PA.
Medications known to prolong the QTc-interval (such as
prokinetic drugs) should be avoided if possible.
Dietary management of MMA/PA
Low protein diet
The basic principles of dietary management are similar for
MMA and PA patients. The mainstay of nutrition therapy
is a low protein intake, limiting but ensuring essential re￾quirements of the propionic acid precursor amino acids,
isoleucine, valine, methionine, and threonine to reduce el￾evated concentrations of metabolites [151]. The amount
of natural protein prescribed is determined by age, growth,
metabolic stability and severity of condition. Ideally, when
using exclusively natural protein, the FAO/WHO/UNU
(2007) safe levels of protein intake should be the ultimate
aim (Table 11). Many but not all centers provide add￾itional precursor-free amino acids that supplement natural

*The FAO/WHO/UNU (2007) have set safe levels of protein intake titrated as an age adjusted mean + 2 SD. Values for safe levels of protein intake apply to males
and females.

protein intake in order to achieve protein requirements
[11,121]. The source of natural protein is important. If
only cereal and vegetable protein sources (low biological
value) are consumed, additional protein may be required
to compensate [158]. Protein intake should be evenly dis￾tributed throughout the day. Patients with mild forms of
MMA/PA may tolerate a natural protein intake that is
equal to or exceeds the FAO/WHO/UNU (2007) safe
levels of protein intake. Occasionally it has been reported
that natural protein is enhanced with both precursor-free
amino acids and additional single isoleucine and valine
[30] supplements but no studies have reported the safety
and efficacy of such an approach. Careful monitoring
of plasma amino acids, in particular branched chain, are
thus required.
Statement #35: Grade of recommendation C-D Dietary
management of MMA/PA aims at metabolic stability
and normal growth. Protein tolerance should be titrated
individually. It is based on adequate energy supply com￾bined with avoidance of prolonged fasting and reduced in￾take of precursor amino acids through a restricted natural
protein diet, commonly supplemented with precursor-free
synthetic amino acids. The FAO/WHO/UNU (2007) safe
levels of protein intake provide a useful guide for protein
prescription.
Amino acid supplements
Although supplementary, precursor free amino acids
are commonly used to contribute to the total protein
intake; their efficacy has not been fully assessed [151]
and the amount prescribed in cross sectional and cohort
studies varies between 15-50% of total protein intake
[11,23,25,151,159,160], partly influenced by metabolic sta￾bility, natural protein intake tolerated, patient age, dis￾order severity and local practice. There is debate about
the amount of any extra precursor free amino acid that
should be prescribed to account for any inefficiency in its
absorption and catabolic rates. In other amino acid disor￾ders, allocation of an extra factor of 20% is given to com￾pensate for ineffective amino acid utilization [161].
Statement #36: Grade of recommendation C-D MMA/
PA precursor free amino acid supplements should form
part of the total protein intake if natural protein toler￾ance is below FAO/WHO/UNU (2007) safe levels of
protein intake and thereby make up any protein deficit
to meet requirements.
Energy requirements
Little is known about energy requirements in MMA/PA.
Whilst this should be individually determined, there should
be a balance between preventing catabolism and overfeed￾ing, particularly if there is decreased physical activity. The
FAO/WHO/UNU (2007) recommendations can be used
to guide energy requirements (Table 11). Overweight has
been reported in MMA and PA children despite energy
intakes lower than recommended for age [162]. There
have been conflicting reports on resting energy expend￾iture (REE) in MMA [163-165]. In contrast, energy re￾quirements during illness are increased coupled with an
increase in resting energy expenditure [135].
Statement #37: Grade of recommendation C-D Intake
of energy is initially guided by energy requirements for
normal healthy children but it should be adjusted for
age, gender, mobility, physical activity and clinical condi￾tion of the child. During metabolic decompensation or
intercurrent illness, especially with fever, energy require￾ments are increased and additional energy supply should
be provided.
Practical aspects of dietary management
There are few published reports of successful demand
breast feeding in MMA/PA [166-168] and some do not
advocate this in MMA/PA [169]. Expressed breast milk
should be encouraged if demand breast feeding is imprac￾ticable. For MMA/PA particular breast milk advantages
include its low protein and amino acid content, protection
against infection, and reduction in gut propionate.
Statement #38: Grade of recommendation C/D Breast
feeding or breast milk with or without MMA/PA precursor￾free amino acids may be considered in the dietary treat￾ment of newly diagnosed neonates/infants.
In bottle fed infants with MMA/PA, natural protein re￾quirements are met from measured amounts of standard
whey dominant infant formulas. To ensure nutritional re￾quirements are fully met, supplementary precursor-free
infant amino formula or protein-free infant formula is
used to provide precursor-free amino acids and/or energy
and micronutrients.
Weaning, usually with fruits and vegetables, is com￾menced at the usual age. Due to the development of po￾tential feeding problems, it is important that early feeding
is supported by speech and language therapy in addition to
dietary care.
In infants with severe phenotypes, tube feeding is com￾monly used early on to deliver the majority of nutritional
requirements [159,160] and prevent nighttime fasting ca￾tabolism. Although there are no controlled studies to sup￾port this, it has been shown to have a positive effect on
morbidity [30,159]. Tube feeding has several advantages
[30] as it
 Helps ensure optimal nutritional intake.
 Overcomes severe anorexia and feeding difficulties,
which commonly occur within the first year of life.
Baumgartner et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases 2014, 9:130 Page 17 of 36
http://www.ojrd.com/content/9/1/130

 Prevents prolonged fasting with release of
propiogenic odd chain fatty acids derived from
lipolysis [170,171].
 Ensures even distribution of natural protein and
energy intake over 24 h.
 Helps to administer medications.
 Permits delivery of prescribed emergency feeds.
 Allows home management of minor illnesses and
decreases hospital admissions.
If tube feeding is needed in the long-term, gastrostomy
is recommended [172]. Enteral feed composition is usually
complex, requiring an individualized protein and energy
profile commonly consisting of separate (or combined)
modules of sources of protein, fat, carbohydrate, vitamins
and minerals. It is essential that all caregivers administer￾ing enteral feeding receive professional instruction in safe
feed production and that their feed preparation technique
is reviewed on an annual basis [136,172-174].
Statement #39: Grade of recommendation C-D Tube
feeding may be necessary to avoid catabolism/prolonged
fasting, achieve nutritional adequacy, administer medica￾tions and supplements and maintain metabolic stability.
Continuous training of parents and health care profes￾sionals to prepare and administer tube feeding is necessary
to minimize safety risks such as incorrect tube position,
dislodgement or wrong feed preparation.
Feeding difficulties are commonly reported in MMA
and PA [173]. It is estimated that about 55% of MMA chil￾dren had intermediate to major feeding problems [151] at
three years of age. Chronic anorexia, oral hypersensitivity,
dysphagia and hyperactive gag reflex are commonly seen.
As there are commonly feeding safety issues and delays in
feeding development, early assessment, advice and sup￾port from a speech and language therapist is important.
Statement #40: Grade of recommendation C-D Feeding
problems are common in children affected by MMA and
PA. Therefore referral to a special feeding clinic with ac￾cess to a speech and language therapist may be beneficial.
Over restriction of natural protein can result in poor
weight gain, poor growth and poor wound healing. Eight
individuals with MMA or PA have been reported with
acrodermatititis enteropathica-like skin complications,
which were associated with low levels of isoleucine.
Consequently it is necessary to ensure adequate levels of
isoleucine in feeds [152,175-177].
Statement #41: Grade of recommendation B-D Dietary
treatment requires careful nutritional supplementation
with clinical, biochemical and dietary monitoring to
prevent nutritional imbalance. Provision of adequate iso￾leucine/branched chain/essential amino acids is needed
with the aim of maintaining essential amino acid levels
within in the normal range for the local laboratory.
Patients with organic acidemias are at risk of osteopenia
and osteoporosis [30,31] which is aggravated as a result of
renal dysfunction in MMA. The metabolic diet used in
MMA and PA may be low in calcium and vitamin D levels
both of which are essential for good bone health. Therefore,
it is important that a complete vitamin and mineral supple￾ment is given if dietary requirements are not achieved from
natural protein sources and precursor-free amino acid sup￾plements. Single case reports of other nutritional deficien￾cies have been described [178-181].
Statement #42: Grade of recommendation C MMA/PA
patients are at increased risk for osteoporosis. Recommen￾dations for bone health include optimizing nutrition, en￾suring adequate calcium and vitamin D. Baseline DEXA
is recommended at 10 years and follow-up according
to bone-health status. Extra attention should be paid to
MMA patients with chronic kidney disease.
Vomiting is a frequent symptom of MMA/PA and may
contribute to metabolic instability or aggravate anorexia.
Central antiemetic agents such as ondansetron or chlor￾promazine may be used with caution. Prokinetic drugs
may contribute to prolonged QTc interval. Constipation is
another chronic manifestation in MMA/PA patients that
should be treated promptly as it has been shown that en￾hancement of gut motility can improve metabolic stability
in patients with PA [182].
Statement #43: Grade of recommendation D Vomiting
and constipation are common problems in MMA/PA.
They may contribute to metabolic instability and should
be anticipated and treated.
Metabolic follow-up, monitoring of diet and nutritional
status and monitoring of long term complications
MMA/PA patients require lifelong monitoring by the
entire metabolic team. Clinical, nutritional, biochemical,
neurodevelopmental and psychological assessment should
aim at optimizing patient development and perform￾ance with age-adapted dietary and drug treatment. Regu￾lar monitoring of metabolic parameters, growth, along
with measures of protein nutrition and overall nutritional
status, as well as regular monitoring for long term compli￾cations are indicated (Table 12). Intervals between visits
should be decided individually on the basis of age, growth,
severity, metabolic stability and compliance with diet
and therapy.
Management of MMA/PA patients during surgical
procedures or prolonged fasting
During general anesthesia or any prolonged fasting it is
important to follow an appropriate protocol, minimizing
Baumgartner et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases 2014, 9:130 Page 18 of 36
http://www.ojrd.com/content/9/1/130

catabolism by providing adequate amounts of calories
(Table 13).
Statement #44: Grade of recommendation D Patients
with MMA/PA, who are usually well controlled, can eas￾ily decompensate during surgery, precipitated by a com￾bination of stress and fasting. Elective surgery in these
patients is usually best done at a hospital with an on site
metabolic unit.
Organ transplantation in MMA/PA patients
The role of organ transplantation in the treatment of
MMA and PA is currently evolving. Transplantation in
MMA and PA should be considered in patients with fre￾quent metabolic decompensations where the clinical con￾dition is difficult to stabilize with dietary/pharmacological
treatment [183,184]. Earlier, liver transplantation was as￾sociated with high mortality rate [185]. This problem has
diminished in more recent years and there have been sev￾eral reports on successful liver transplantations with a
drastic decrease of hospital admissions and improvement
in quality of life [186-189]. The most important concerns,
particularly in MMA are neurologic complications, such
as basal ganglia and cerebellar stroke, movement disor￾ders, tremor and sensorineural hearing loss, occurring
even after liver or combined liver and kidney transplant￾ation [190-195]. Thus transplantation can only be consid￾ered as a symptomatic treatment aiming at improvement
of quality of life, but not as a definitive cure of the disease.
Liver/combined liver-kidney transplantation in MMA
Solid-organ transplantation, such as single liver (LT) or
kidney transplantation (KT), or combined liver/kidney
transplantation, has become an effective alternative treat￾ment option in recent decades [192,195,196]. Isolated liver
transplantation should be performed early in life to main￾tain normal renal function [186]. In liver transplanted
MMA patients, decreased but not completely corrected
plasma and urine levels of methylmalonate have been ob￾served [191,197]. At more advanced age kidney function
will likely continue to decline after LT thus necessitating
secondary KT [70,192,193,198]. Renal failure is sometimes
even accelerated by the use of immunosuppressive drugs
after LT (unpublished but shared expert experience). The

perioperative treatment needs to prevent catabolism to
avoid metabolic decompensation. Lactate seems to be the
most reliable parameter for control [183]. MMA and
methylcitrate levels in CSF samples after transplantation
remained high [191,193], most probably explained by the
presence of the metabolic defect also in the central ner￾vous system (CNS) [199]. Patients thus remain at risk of
developing acute or chronic neurological complications
after transplantation. It is yet not clear if the continuation
of restricted protein intake and medication can prevent
these complications.
Liver transplantation in PA
LT in PA has been proposed to minimize the risk of fur￾ther decompensations and to improve the quality of life
[12]. However, experience with LT in PA is still limited.
Recent case studies have reported clinical improvement,
including significant decrease of episodes of metabolic de￾compensation, better feeding, and improved neurological
development after LT [187,200]. Moreover, LT has been
shown to effectively reverse cardiomyopathy [44,201].
The effect on the central nervous system remains unclear.
There is one report on improved EEG after LT [202], but
basal ganglia strokes have also occurred after LT [184,203].
The observation of severe metabolic acidosis 3 years after
successful LT without protein restriction [204] and a less
significant reduction of circulating metabolites after LT
and increased protein intake [205] suggest that a certain
level of protein restriction and carnitine supplementation
may be indicated even after LT.
Statement #45: Grade of recommendation C-D Liver
and/or kidney transplantation should be considered as
an alternative therapy to conventional medical treatment
in MMA and PA patients with frequent metabolic decom￾pensations where the clinical condition is difficult to
stabilize. Ideally, it should be performed before appearance
of severe neurologic damage and under stable metabolic
Table 13 Considerations and management of general anesthesia
Elective procedures Emergency operations and major procedures (>30 minutes)
- Check that the child is healthy 48 hours before surgery. If not,
postpone the operation.
- Seek specialist advice
- Last metabolic work-up must have taken place less than 3 months - On admission
• Check plasma ammonia, pH, blood gases
• If ammonia >100 μmol/l, pH < 7.30 or base deficit > 10 mmol/l) or the
child is unwell, cancel elective procedures and/or seek specialist advice
Management
- Stop feeds according to minimal anesthetic requirements and replace by clear carbohydrate containing fluids or intravenous 10% glucose
and appropriate electrolytes at a rate allowing to block lipolysis:
• 8-10 mg/kg/min for neonates and infants
• 6-7 mg/kg/min for children
• 5-6 mg/kg/min for adolescents
• 4-5 mg/kg/min for adults
- For B12 responsive patients administer hydroxocobalamin 1mg parenterally 24 h before and on the day of the procedure
- Add intravenous L-carnitine: 100 mg/kg/ day (max. 12 g for adults)
The infusion and treatment should be maintained during the whole surgical procedure. The use of intravenous lipid solution may be considered
for longer procedures (1 to 2 g/kg/day IV).
Post-operative management
- Following the operation, feed depending on metabolic stability at the time you would feed any other patient following an equivalent procedure.
- Give whatever oral medicines the patient may be due at the same time
- Discontinue the intravenous infusion ONLY after the child has been seen to tolerate food.
- Remove the cannula ONLY when normal feeding has been achieved.
- If recovery is delayed or complicated by vomiting:
• check blood gases, electrolytes and ammonia
• consider using antiemetic drugs (ondansetron, avoid metoclopramide)
• continue glucose and L-carnitine infusion and add IV lipids (1-2 g/kg/d)
• IV amino acids should be added if the patient cannot be fed (0.5-0.8 g/kg/d)
- Discharge ONLY after full recovery and normal metabolic results. This will often be the following day.

conditions. However, transplantation only partially corrects
the enzymatic defect; renal and neurological complications
may still occur afterwards. Due to the persistent risk of
neurological degeneration and/or metabolic decompensa￾tion and in the absence of scientific data, maintenance of
protein restriction and L-carnitine supplementation after
transplantation seems to be warranted. Any indication for
transplantation must be decided on an individual patient
basis taking into account the balance between expected
improvement of life quality and the morbidity/mortality
risk related to the procedure.

, cblA and cblB defects [206,207]. Sur￾prisingly, these patients showed a significant improvement
in quality of life with less metabolic decompensations and
reduced plasma levels of pathological metabolites after
KT [206,208-212]. Since it has been observed that urinary
MMA excretion decreased even more significantly after
KT or combined liver/kidney transplantation than after
single LT, it has been suggested that KT not only corrects
renal dysfunction but may also be sufficient to ensure par￾tial correction of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase activity to
prevent metabolic decompensation. Thus, it seems that
the small amount of enzyme activity gained by KT is suffi￾cient to improve the metabolic balance of MMA patients.
Despite some postoperative complications after transplant￾ation [213], the outcome of single LT has been associated
with a higher mortality and its effectiveness was hampered
by severe post-transplant complications [190]. KT might
thus be a safer and more satisfactory treatment option for
MMA patients. As to the time point when to perform kid￾ney transplantation, it should be noted that a decrease of
urinary excretion of MMA (even erroneously interpreted
as a stabilization of metabolic control) and an increase of
plasma concentrations is often seen before end stage renal
disease is reached. This results in an increased risk of
neurologic damage and further impaired kidney function.
The decision for KT should be individualized and made
jointly between the metabolic and nephrology teams.
Statement #46: Grade of recommendation D For MMA
patients in end stage renal failure combined liver/kidney
transplantation has been mostly used so far. However, sev￾eral reports on isolated kidney transplantation evoke this
procedure as an alternative and safer strategy as it seems
to restore sufficient enzyme activity and also improves the
quality of life of patients.
Type of liver transplant, donor and ethical issues
Standard orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is pre￾ferred to auxiliary LT because it has been associated with
fewer complications [197]. Transplantation of liver lobes
from living relatives can reduce waiting times and gives
results comparable to those obtained with cadaveric or￾gans, albeit with a small risk for donors [197]. Heterozy￾gosity for the disease in the living related donor is not a
contraindication. The benefits of organ transplantation
must be individually and meticulously weighed against
the risk of perioperative complications, including renal
and neurological progressive impairment in the post￾transplant period. Decisions on whether or not to per￾form LT entail ethical considerations requiring individu￾alized decision, in particular when the child is already
neurologically impaired or when living donor LT is con￾sidered [214].
Statement #47: Grade of recommendation D If liver
transplantation is considered, the recommended procedure
is orthotopic liver transplantation. Ethical issues concerning
the risk for the recipient and for living donors make careful
pre- and post-transplantation counseling obligatory.
Experimental therapies
Liver cell transplantation and liver progenitor cell trans￾plantation have been proposed to restore some of the
lacking enzyme activity in the liver by infusion of either
liver cells or liver progenitor cells [215-218]. Clinical trials
testing the safety and efficacy of the procedures in urea
cycle disorders are ongoing. Application in patients with
other inborn errors of metabolism (including MMA/PA)
is planned for a second phase.
Proof of principle for a nonsense read-through therapy
in PA [219] and for chaperone therapy in MMA [220] has
been achieved in cellular models.
Successful gene therapy has been reported for adeno￾associated viral gene delivery in the lethal Mut-/- mouse
model [221-223]. No clinical trial has been performed in
humans so far.
From a pathophysiological point of view the use of an￾tioxidants to reduce oxidative stress may be indicated in
MMA and PA [224-231]. So far evidence for clinical effi￾cacy is lacking and no systematic study or treatment trial
has been performed. The choice of antioxidant substance(s)
and dosage, particularly in the pediatric age group, remains
to be determined.
Statement #48: Grade of recommendation D The ad￾ministration of antioxidants is potentially beneficial for
MMA and PA patients, but needs to be confirmed in
prospective clinical studies. The use of liver cell trans￾plantation or liver progenitor cell transplantation is not
presently a therapeutic option for MMA and PA patients
since no clinical experience is available for these disor￾ders. Treatment strategies based on gene therapy and
read-through/chaperone therapy show promising results
Baumgartner et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases 2014, 9:130 Page 21 of 36

in preclinical studies and might become interesting op￾tions in the future.
Long-term complications and management
Long-term survival in MMA/PA has significantly improved
over the last twenty years [21,25,26]. Therefore long-term
complications become increasingly apparent and pose new
challenges in patients’ care.
For an overview on metabolic follow-up, monitoring of
diet and nutritional status as well as monitoring of long
term complications please see Table 12.
Cognitive development and health related quality of life
Data on the extent and characteristics of mental devel￾opment and intellectual disability in both diseases are
presented non-uniformly in the literature, i.e. a variety of
evaluation instruments and test batteries have been used
in different studies. Furthermore, patient populations, as
well as cut-off values for normal development were spe￾cified differently and patients were tested at different
points of time.
In MMA, vitamin B12 non-responsiveness [232], early
onset of disease [121,159], the presence of hyperammone￾mia at diagnosis or a history of seizures [58], as well as a
mut° phenotype [25,48,233] were associated with more se￾vere cognitive impairment. A significant deficit of process￾ing speed seems to be a general feature [58].
Statement #49: Grade of recommendation C Vitamin
B12 non-responsiveness, early onset of disease, hyperam￾monemia at onset, a history of seizures, as well as mut°
as underlying cause of MMA are risk factors for signifi￾cant impairment of cognitive development.
PA seems to be associated with cognitive impairment
in a significant number of patients which in most studies
exceeds 50% of included patients [23,30,33,121,160,232].
At present it remains unclear whether the early onset
form results in more severe impairment of cognitive func￾tions than the late onset form.
Statement #50: Grade of recommendation C PA
seems to be generally associated with significant cogni￾tive impairment.
Several prospective and retrospective studies on PA
[30,234] and MMA [48,235] indicate that developmental
delay and intellectual disability may not be prevented by
(early) treatment. This observation is supported by a re￾cent study showing that early diagnosis of PA through
newborn screening seems to be associated with lower
mortality but does not result in improved neurocognitive
development [21].
Statement #51: Grade of recommendation C-D Despite
intensive medical treatment, MMA and PA are associated
with a high frequency of intellectual disability. Cognitive
impairment seems to become pronounced from the sec￾ond year of life.
Monitoring of cognitive development and health-related
quality of life
Besides clinical assessment, a wide variety of evaluation
instruments and test batteries at different measurement
points have been reported in the literature. Thus no rec￾ommendation of specific tests or measurement intervals
can be deduced.
Statement #52: Grade of recommendation D Intellec￾tual abilities and cognitive development should be assessed
early and reliably to allow timely referral for therapeutic
and rehabilitative intervention. Testing should be age￾appropriate using standardized instruments. Culturally
appropriate and language-free methods are recommended
for patients with impaired speech or command of the
language.
Statement #53: Grade of recommendation D Health
related quality of life, stress and psychosocial factors are
meaningful outcome parameters which have not been
investigated systematically in MMA/ PA patients and
their caregivers so far, but should be considered and ad￾dressed in the future. Standard settings of care in terms
of a multidisciplinary approach including social workers,
psychologists, dieticians, rehabilitation services and spe￾cialized physicians should be defined.
Neurological complications
Neurological symptoms are frequent in MMA/PA at the
beginning and during the course of the disease (see also
Tables 3 and 5). Regarding diagnosis, management and
monitoring of long-term neurological complications see
also Table 12.
Statement #54: Grade of recommendation D Neuro￾logical examination with detailed history of developmental
milestones should be a routine part of evaluation in every
visit to the metabolic clinic. Input from a pediatric neur￾ologist should be considered in case of acute neurological
presentation (encephalopathy/coma, seizures), any suspi￾cion of developmental delay, spasticity/dystonia and move￾ment disorder, epilepsy, hearing or visual field defects.
Seizures/Epilepsy can be an acute or chronic manifest￾ation of MMA and PA. In early childhood seizures tend to
be generalized or myoclonic, and during later childhood
generalized or absence in nature [24,28,35,139,236,237]
Patients should be referred to a pediatric neurologist at
the time of a seizure event. Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs)
should be introduced according to seizure semiology
and EEG findings [24,28,237]. Corticosteroids have been
Baumgartner et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases 2014, 9:130 Page 22 of 36
http://www.ojrd.com/content/9/1/130

successfully used in the management of a patient with
MMA and infantile spasms with a hypsarrythmia pattern
on EEG [156].
Statement #55: Grade of recommendation D Epilepsy
is common in MMA and PA patients. In patients with
clinical suspicion of seizures an EEG should be performed.
Referral to a pediatric neurologist is recommended in the
case of a seizure event, and/or if epileptiform activity is
detected in the EEG. AEDs for epileptic seizures must be
chosen according to seizure types and EEG abnormalities.
Valproate is not contraindicated but is associated with a
risk of hyperammonemia.
Movement disorders are frequent, being reported in
19-45% of patients with MMA and PA [25,28,33].
L-Dopa/Carbidopa, trihexylphenidyl, clonazepam, baclofen
(oral, continuous intrathecal, ventriculoperitoneal shunt)
treatments can be effective in patients with acute/chronic
dyskinesia and movement disorder [238,239]. For the long
term monitoring of patients with extrapyramidal symp￾toms (dyskinesia, myoclonus, choreoathetosis), and pyram￾idal tract involvement (spasticity), functional scales such as
Barry-Albright scale for dystonia, and Ashworth scale or
Gross Motor Function Measure for spasticity may be help￾ful to objectively monitor patients and effectiveness of
treatment protocols [238,240]. A multidisciplinary team in￾volving physical and rehabilitation therapists, and pediatric
neurologists should evaluate patients with extrapyramidal
symptoms and spasticity [139].
Metabolic stroke-like events involving the basal gan￾glia have been described in about 10 MMA and PA pa￾tients [21,35,55,60-63] and these have usually occurred
during or shortly after metabolic decompensation. How￾ever, several cases of PA have been published with purely
neurologic presentation without the expected heralding
ketoacidotic attacks [7,20,35,59,64,65].
Adequate fluid and caloric intake and symptomatic
treatment of focal neurological deficits and altered men￾tal status during stroke-like episodes is crucial [139].
Statement #56: Grade of recommendation C-D Move￾ment disorders are frequent in MMA and PA and may
be associated with stroke-like events and basal ganglia
necrosis. Treatment is symptomatic.
Optic neuropathy has been reported as a late com￾plication in at least fourteen patients with MMA or PA
[31,66-69,241]. Acute or chronic visual loss due to optic
neuropathy may be a rare complication. Antioxidant drugs
have been used to treat optic neuropathy with improved
visual acuity reported in one patient treated with high
dose vitamin E and Coenzyme Q10 [66]. Consequently,
ophthalmologic evaluation by an ophthalmologist in￾cluding visual acuity as well as visual examination of the
anterior chamber, and dilated evaluation of the fundus
should be routinely performed [139].
Statement #57: Grade of recommendation D Ophthal￾mologic assessment (fundoscopy, visual acuity and visual
field) and a formal examination by an ophthalmologist
to exclude optic neuropathy should be a part of routine
evaluation in MMA and PA patients at baseline, at any
time of concern and yearly after 6 years of age. Antioxi￾dant drugs have been used experimentally in the treat￾ment of optic atrophy.
Neuroimaging provides information about the timing,
extent, reversibility, and possible mechanisms of neural
injury, and can be used as a complementary tool to track
the course of the disease in MMA and PA patients. Rou￾tine neuroimaging in the absence of neurological find￾ings is not necessary [237] and risks of sedation and
anesthesia for the imaging procedure should be consid￾ered. In a patient with neurological symptoms at presen￾tation and/or any time during the course of the disease,
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the preferred im￾aging technique. MRI sequences should ideally include
diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), apparent diffusion co￾efficient (ADC) maps, axial T2 and FLAIR, sagittal and
axial T1.
Neuroimaging findings are similar in MMA and PA.
Typically, there is symmetric involvement of basal ganglia,
with selective pallidal involvement reported in MMA
[242]. Edema, sometimes with restricted diffusion suggests
a cytotoxic insult and is a well-documented phenomenon
in PA in the acute phase, most frequently found in basal
ganglia, but also in the cerebral cortex [242,243]. Reso￾lution of findings on routine T2W images, DWI and ADC
[60,243,244] usually corresponds to improvement of clin￾ical symptoms and biochemical parameters. Figures 2, 3, 4
and 5 show typical (as judged by the guideline group) neu￾roimaging findings at the time of acute clinical and/or
metabolic decompensation in MMA (Figures 2 and 3) and
PA (Figures 4 and 5).
During the first year of life there is moderate to severe
widening of sulci and fissures more commonly reported
in PA patients. Resolution with treatment is reported in
MMA patients, and there is mild to moderate delay in
myelination [242,245]. Thin corpus callosum and brain￾stem atrophy have also been described [246]. It should
also be recognized that, the brain parenchymal metabol￾ite profile may be affected without significant metabolic
decompensation, and even without structural changes
on neuroimaging patients may develop movement disor￾ders [35]. 1HMagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) is a powerful
clinical tool as a complementary method to MR imaging to
understand disease process in the brain, particularly by
in vivo demonstration of brain metabolites [245,247]. MRS
Baumgartner et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases 2014, 9:130 Page 23 of 36
http://www.ojrd.com/content/9/1/130

in acute phases demonstrated decreased NAA and in￾creased lactate peaks, and normalization of values
with treatment, in parallel with improvement of clinical
symptoms and biochemical parameters [234,247,248]. Ab￾normal MRS in the presence of negative MRI findings
may help to define the region vulnerable and at risk for
damage in the CNS [234,245,249].
In the research setting, advanced imaging such as mag￾netic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), diffusion-tensor im￾aging (DTI), and functional imaging studies (PET) may
provide useful and sensitive complementary informa￾tion for the assessment of brain damage and follow￾up [244,248,250,251].
Statement #58: Grade of recommendation D Routine
screening MRI in the absence of changes in neurological
symptoms is not necessary and may expose the patient
to additional risks related to anesthesia. Conversely, at
the time of newly appearing neurological complications
MRI may be indicated.
Visual evoked potentials (VEP) should be included in oph￾thalmological evaluation as a complementary tool since acute
or chronic visual loss due to optic neuropathy is possible dur￾ing the course of the disease (see above). Hearing loss can be
a rare complication of MMA/PA [236]. Evaluation of hearing
(brainstem auditory evoked response (BAER) and/or audio￾metric tests) should therefore be performed as indicated.
Statement #59: Grade of recommendation D Evoked
potentials (visual evoked potentials: VEP; brainstem
auditory evoked responses: BAER or audiometry) should
be considered if clinically indicated.
Renal complications
All individuals with isolated MMA, even those who are
mildly affected, are thought to be at risk of developing
Figure 2 Neuroimaging finding in MMA: Male child with MMA (cblA defect). An MRI study was obtained at the age of 6 months because
of irritability, feeding difficulties, developmental delay, encephalopathy and metabolic decompensation. The caudate and lentiform nuclei are
swollen and hyperintense on axial T2-weighted (W) turbo spin-echo (SE) image (A) with restricted diffusion suggested by hyperintensity on trace
diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) (B) and low signals on ADC map (C). Proton MR spectroscopy (TE:135ms) performed from the lesions reveals
decreased N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA), increased choline (Cho) and presence of lactate (D).

shows residual T2 hyperintensity in the caudate nuclei and necrosis in the lentiform nuclei with reversal of abnormalities in the globus pallidi (A).
There is CSF-like unrestricted diffusion in the lentiform nuclei on DWI (B) and ADC map (C) and elevated Cho on MR spectroscopy (D).

renal insufficiency [252]. Chronic kidney disease (CKD)
occurred in 47% of patients with a median age of onset
at 6.5y [48] and was found most frequently in mut°
(61%) and cblB (66%), less frequently in cblA (21%) and
mut− (0%) patients [25]. CKD was predicted by the urin￾ary excretion of methylmalonic acid and the disease course
was further aggravated by secondary complications of CKD,
such as anemia, arterial hypertension, renal osteodystrophy,
and hyperparathyroidism [25]. CKD often remained stable
for several years, sometimes even until adulthood; pro￾gression to end-stage renal disease occurred in 12-14% of
patients [25,48]. A recent study reported that the rate of
increase of kidney growth significantly decreased in pa￾tients with MMA over time and was predicted by height,
serum cystatin C, and serum methylmalonic acid concen￾tration [253].
In patients with MMA two main pathologies have
been reported, chronic tubulo-interstitial nephritis [49],
and renal tubular acidosis [254,255].
On renal biopsy chronic tubulo-interstitial nephritis
with mononuclear cell infiltration, interstitial fibrosis
and tubular atrophy has been demonstrated [53]. The
precise pathogenesis remains obscure, but recent studies
suggest that proximal tubular mitochondrial dysfunction
and increased serum methylmalonic acid levels are key
pathogenic mechanisms in MMA-associated kidney dis￾ease [229,230,256].
In PA, renal insufficiency has been reported in 3 pa￾tients [27,70,257].
Statement #60: Grade of recommendation C One of
the most severe long-term complications in MMA is
chronic kidney disease (CKD). The two most frequent
complications reported are chronic tubulo-interstitial
nephritis and renal tubular acidosis. CKD is character￾ized by progressive functional abnormality leading to
chronic renal failure. The precise pathogenesis remains
obscure but proximal tubular mitochondrial dysfunction
Figure 4 Neuroimaging finding in PA: Male child with PA, symptomatic from day 4 of life, diagnosed at the age of 4 months. An MRI
was obtained at the age of 5 years when he developed acute encephalopathy. Cerebral cortices especially of the temporal and occipital lobes
and the basal ganglia (caudate and lentiform nuclei) are swollen and mildly hyperintense on axial T2W TSE (A). Hyperintensity on trace DWI
(B) and low intensity on ADC maps (C) suggestive of restricted diffusion are seen in those affected regions.
Figure 5 Neuroimaging finding in PA: Male child with PA, symptomatic from day 4 of life, diagnosed at the age of 4 months. A week
later a repeat MR study showed more intense T2 signal changes in the involved regions, more prominent in the putamina (A). Although a higher
signal intensity of the cortices and basal ganglia on trace DWI (B), with disappearance of low signal of the cortices and presence of higher signal
intensity on ADC maps (C) there’s pseudonormalization of diffusion restriction.

and increased serum MMA levels have been proposed as
key pathogenic mechanisms in MMA-associated kidney
disease. In PA renal failure has been reported anecdotally.
Management of long-term renal complications
Standard medical treatment and follow-up of CKD fol￾lows the established general therapeutic principles of pa￾tients without an inborn error of metabolism [258]
including control of blood pressure, electrolytes, second￾ary hyperparathyroidism, and renal anemia and associ￾ated osteodystrophy. Experience with renoprotective
measures in the pediatric population has not been thor￾oughly studied. In case of microalbuminuria or protein￾uria in association with hypertension, ACE inhibitors or
angiotensin receptor antagonists are recommend with
the aim of reaching age adjusted targets of blood pres￾sure control [259].
Treatment with oxygen radical scavengers, such as co￾enzyme Q10, glutathione, MitoQ might be beneficial
[230]. Further therapeutic strategies that aim at decreas￾ing toxic metabolites, including dietary restriction of
precursor amino acids or an enhanced tubular excretion
of toxic compounds, may also protect the kidney. Like
for other CKD, growth hormone may also be of benefit,
although no specific studies are available.
Renal replacement therapy, including hemodialysis/
hemodiafiltration or peritoneal dialysis, is not only im￾portant for long-term treatment of end-stage renal disease
but also as a preoperative measure before organ transplant￾ation or to treat severe hyperammonemia during acute
metabolic crisis, especially in neonates.
Finally, it has been suggested that kidney transplantation
not only corrects renal dysfunction but may also provide
partial correction of the enzymatic defect and improve
metabolic control (see above).
Statement #61: Grade of recommendation C-D The
management of the long-term renal complications is based
on adequate hydration, drug therapy, hemo- or peritoneal
dialysis and ultimately kidney transplantation.
Diagnostic tests to monitor renal long-term complications
Renal function should be carefully monitored (see also
Table 12) because of the risk of developing end-stage
CKD requiring hemodialysis and kidney transplantation
[26]. Serum creatinine-based glomerular filtration rate
(GFR) estimates may overestimate true GFR due to low
muscle mass [46] and low protein intake. Cumulative
urinary MMA excretion over time (measured in repeti￾tive spot urines) correlates with the risk of CKD and has
been proposed as a follow-up parameter for renal func￾tion [25]. However, with declining kidney function urin￾ary MMA ceases to be a reliable marker and should be
replaced by plasma MMA. Thus GFR estimates that
include serum cystatin C (and creatinine) as well as
plasma MMA appear to be the most accurate [253].
Ideally inulin or iohexol clearance should be measured.
Statement #62: Grade of recommendation C-D Regular
measurements of glomerular filtration rate and plasma
and urinary MMA are recommended as parameters in
the follow-up of patients with MMA. With declining
kidney function urinary MMA ceases to be a reliable
marker and should be replaced by plasma MMA. Plasma
creatinine levels may be less reliable in these patients
due to the poor muscle mass and the low protein intake
and may be complemented with cystatin C, however
trends can still be informative.
Cardiac complications
Cardiomyopathy [21,23,26,31,39,43,44,71,148,260] and pro￾longed QTc interval [21,31,38,40,41,56] are emerging as
potentially lethal complications in MMA and, more prom￾inently, PA. Additionally there are several reports of heart
failure in patients with MMA and PA who did not have
cardiomyopathy [187,261,262]. Median age of presenta￾tion of cardiomyopathy was 7 years [44]. The etiology of
prolonged QTc interval is not well understood but sudden
death has been described in this patient population
[38,40]. Liver transplantation has been shown to improve
cardiomyopathy in 3 PA patients, one of which had severe
heart failure [44,261].
Statement #63: Grade of recommendation C-D Cardiac
complications include cardiomyopathy and prolonged
QTc interval which may be life-threatening and may occur
in MMA and PA patients with increasing frequency with
age. Therefore ECG and heart ultrasound (echocardiog￾raphy) are recommended every year. If cardiomyopathy
or long QTc is present standard cardiac therapy should be
undertaken and metabolic treatment and monitoring should
be optimized. Liver transplantation has been reported to re￾verse cardiomyopathy in PA.
Pancreatitis
Acute, recurrent acute and chronic pancreatitis are pos￾sible long-term complications of MMA [72,73] and PA
[75,76,263]. The pathogenesis is unclear.
Statement #64: Grade of recommendation C-D Acute,
recurrent acute and chronic pancreatitis may develop in
MMA and PA, independently from metabolic decompen￾sations and metabolic control. Clinical presentation of
pancreatitis is similar to individuals without MMA/PA,
but can mimic features of metabolic decompensation.
Baumgartner et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases 2014, 9:130 Page 26 of 36
http://www.ojrd.com/content/9/1/130

Diagnostic tests and investigations to monitor pancreatic
long-term complications
(see also Table 12) Similar laboratory changes [72,73,75,76,263]
and radiographic signs [72] to those seen in any patient
with pancreatitis have been reported including elevated
blood glucose, lipase and amylase (may be normal in the
beginning) and lowered calcium. Acidosis and ketonuria
have also been reported, but not hyperammonemia. Amyl￾ase and lipase may be elevated in patients with renal insuf￾ficiency and have been reported in a single PA patient
during metabolic decompensation but without evidence of
pancreatitis on ultrasound [263]. Measurement of lipase
and amylase is recommended at annual intervals (espe￾cially if chronic renal failure develops) and whenever pan￾creatitis is suspected. If pancreatitis is suspected MRI/
MRCP or CT scan should be performed as recommended
in patients without metabolic disease.
Statement #65: Grade of recommendation C-D Diag￾nosis of acute or chronic pancreatitis follows the same
principles as in any other case of pancreatitis.
Management of long-term pancreatic complications
Acute pancreatitis should be managed as in any other
case of pancreatitis including fluid resuscitation and pain
management. Enteral (jejunal) nutrition is preferred [264].
The only specific recommendation for MMA/PA patients
has been made for carnitine supplementation in PA pa￾tients [139].
Statement #66: Grade of recommendation D Manage￾ment of acute pancreatitis follows the same principles as
in any other case of pancreatitis. Adequate carnitine sup￾plementation is recommended.
Hematological and immunological complications are
common in MMA and PA. Pancytopenia at initial pres￾entation has been described in a number of patients
[21,31,265-270]. Moreover, signs of immunodeficiency, espe￾cially neutropenia, are quite common also during the course
of disease [7,23,31] and these may resolve with aggressive
therapy [31,271]. Isolated thrombocytopenia may occur dur￾ing any metabolic decompensation [7,21,31,265,272].
There are several reports of infections with numerous types
of pathogens and death by sepsis [7,160,266,267,270,273].
Moreover, central line placement has been compromised
by infection [134]. There is very little experience with
granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and/or
intravenous immunoglobulin in this patient population
[31]; indication for treatment with G-CSF therefore re￾mains unclear.
Despite a concern about immunological dysfunction,
patients with inborn errors of metabolism are not at in￾creased risk of metabolic decompensation following ap￾propriate vaccinations [274] and thus all childhood
immunizations should be undertaken. In addition, in￾fluenza vaccine should also be given.
Statement #67: Grade of recommendation C Pancyto￾penia (especially neutropenia) is frequent in MMA and
PA and may respond to improved metabolic control.
Evaluation with a low threshold to treat infections as
well as infection control practices should be performed
according to institutional guidelines early in neutropenic
patients. Standard immunizations should be given.
Risk of cancer and liver cirrhosis
Despite the association of cancers with mutations in
genes coding for Krebs cycle enzymes, there is only one
case of cancer (hepatoblastoma) in the literature, which
occurred in a MMA patient 2 years after a renal trans￾plant and 3 years after growth hormone therapy [213].
To our knowledge, liver cirrhosis has been found in 2
PA patients and in one MMA patient. However these
have not yet been reported in the literature.
Special issues in adult care
Women’s health and pregnancy
Pregnancy issues, contraception and sexual health should
already be discussed during adolescence [275,276]. No
disease-specific contraindications to the use of hormonal
contraceptives in MMA and PA patients have been re￾ported. In some cases, hormonal contraceptives may be
used to prevent perimenstrual metabolic instability. For pa￾tients with functional amenorrhea hormone replacement
therapy or hormonal contraceptives should be offered.
Successful pregnancies have been reported in rela￾tively mild cases of MMA (mut− or vitamin B12-responsive)
[232,275,277-279] and PA [275,280]. These patients remained
metabolically stable throughout pregnancy with delivery
of healthy children. However, there may be a reporting
bias. Based on the few case reports available, methylmalo￾nic acid does not appear to be teratogenic [279], and this
presumably holds true for other metabolites accumulating
in stably controlled MMA or PA.
Pregnancy should be planned ahead and metabolic
control optimized prior to conception.
During pregnancy, the protein demand/tolerance and
carnitine requirements may increase and treatment should
be adapted accordingly. The carnitine dose should be in￾creased according to measured free carnitine levels. Due
to the risk of protein energy malnutrition and micronu￾trient deficiency, regular nutritional assessment during
pregnancy is mandatory. Morning sickness (or hyperem￾esis) with nausea and vomiting must be taken seriously, as
it constitutes a risk of metabolic decompensation and/or
protein energy malnutrition, and treatment (e.g. potent
antiemetics) should be initiated early.
Baumgartner et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases 2014, 9:130 Page 27 of 36
http://www.ojrd.com/content/9/1/130

During labor and delivery there is a higher energy de￾mand and supplemental calories should be supplied to
minimize the risk of metabolic decompensation, using
intravenous glucose (e.g. 10% 2 ml/kg/h = 200 mg/kg/h)
[275,276]. Postpartum catabolism constitutes a risk of
metabolic decompensation due to a massive internal
protein load with the involution of the uterus and thus
demands close monitoring and intervention. However,
no serious problems have been noted in the reported
cases of mild MMA and PA. Breastfeeding also increases
energy demands and adequate energy intake should be
insured.
Statement #68: Grade of recommendation D Pregnancy
should be planned ahead and metabolic control optimized
prior to conception. Regular nutritional assessment and
metabolic monitoring during pregnancy is mandatory. An
increase in protein demand/tolerance and carnitine re￾quirements may occur and treatment should be adapted
accordingly.
Supplemental calories, intravenous glucose and carni￾tine should be supplied peripartum to minimize the risk
of metabolic decompensation. Postpartum catabolism
constitutes a risk of metabolic decompensation and de￾mands close monitoring.
Transition and social issues
Literature specifically addressing social issues and long￾term needs of adult patients with MMA or PA is scarce.
The majority of MMA and PA patients surviving into
adulthood are not able to live independently and need
some kind of social support [232]. However, some pa￾tients with mild and/or late onset disease and normal
psychomotor development may reach independence and
higher education. Continuing from childhood to adult
life, appropriate services and structures should be pro￾vided to support psychosocial development and special
educational needs. Transition of a young patient from
pediatric to adult services should begin early to prepare
a teenager (and their family) for the move to adult ser￾vices, with encouragement of independence and self￾confidence. Adult patients with chronic disease are at risk
for developing mood disorders, which may complicate
treatment. Depressive disorders should be recognized and
appropriate treatment provided.
Statement #69: Grade of recommendation D Transi￾tion from pediatric to adult services should begin early
and be well coordinated with encouragement of inde￾pendence and self-confidence. The majority of patients
surviving into adulthood need some kind of social sup￾port. Services and structures should be provided to sup￾port psychosocial development and special educational
needs beyond childhood throughout adult life.
Recommendations for long-term follow-up (see long term
complications above)
Adult patients with MMA or PA have multisystem problems
and require coordinated, multidisciplinary care, with emphasis
on monitoring and management of long-term complications
(e.g. renal, bone, cardiac, neurological, ophthalmological,
see Table 12). In general, protein tolerance may improve
in adulthood and hospitalizations tend to be less frequent
[232]. However, prevention of chronic protein-malnutrition
and micronutrient deficiencies is essential and regular nu￾tritional assessments are recommended.
Anorexia and feeding problems are frequent in adult pa￾tients, with some still requiring nocturnal tube feeding or
energy supplements during the day to maintain satisfac￾tory nutritional status. Many have short stature and low
bone mineral density. There are no formal recommenda￾tions for protein intake in adult patients with organic acid￾emias. There are reports of protein tolerance increasing
and hospitalizations for metabolic decompensation occur
less frequently. Many patients may follow a self-restricted
protein intake with between 0.5 and 1.1g/kg per day [232].
For osteopenia or osteoporosis, treatment decisions
need to be individualized, integrating measured parame￾ters of bone metabolism and including secondary hyper￾parathyroidism in patients with chronic renal failure. In
patients with renal failure, the diagnosis of osteoporosis
should be made only in the absence of renal osteodystro￾phy. The role of antiresorptive drugs (e.g. bisphosphonates)
for treatment or prevention of osteoporosis has not been
studied in MMA/PA; thus, treatment decisions need to be
made individually (after excluding renal osteodystrophy).
Tools assessing fracture risk (such as FRAX) [281,282] are
not designed or validated for this patient group, and there￾fore are not suitable for guiding treatment decisions. The
role of RANKL-Inhibitors (Denosumab) will need to be
established in this patient group, but may be an option for
patients with osteoporosis and relative contra-indications
to bisphosphonates, e.g. renal failure.
Medical treatment of heart failure in patients with car￾diomyopathy follows the established therapeutic princi￾ples of patients without MMA/PA [283]. However, PA
patients should be evaluated for liver transplantation,
which has been reported to reverse cardiomyopathy in
some PA patients [44].
Statement #70: Grade of recommendation D Adult
patients with MMA or PA have multisystem problems
and require coordinated multidisciplinary care, with em￾phasis on monitoring and management of long-term
complications (see long-term complications above).
Closing remarks
These guidelines are the result of a three year process based
on the SIGN methodology and are aimed at delivering the
Baumgartner et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases 2014, 9:130 Page 28 of 36
http://www.ojrd.com/content/9/1/130

best available level of evidence for any given recommenda￾tion. The rarity of MMA/PA and the virtual absence of
international registries at least until recently, have resulted
in mostly C or D levels of evidence for the statements
made, which correspond to inferences derived from non￾analytical studies such as case reports, case series or ex￾pert opinion. Therefore, these recommendations should
not be considered infallible or absolute. The working
group of this guideline commits itself to revise the work
in the future in an effort to preserve the achieved quality
and to search for higher evidence levels that might be
achieved with time. Indeed, it is hoped that many of the
statements will be substituted in forthcoming years by
even more precise and effective recommendations to the
benefit of the patients.
Competing interests
The authors of this guideline declare no competing interests but disclose the
following: MRB has received financial support for attending E-IMD steering
committee meetings from Orphan Europe and has received support from
Milupa and SHS for travel grants to develop a quality of life assessment tool
for patients with intoxication type metabolic diseases.
Authors’ contributions
All authors of this work have contributed to the underlying process based

and S. Dubois who actively contributed to the GDG and Prof. Dr. Kader Karli
Oguz for her help with the MRI figures. Likewise, we acknowledge the
methodological training given by P. Burgard and J. Häberle during the first
guideline meeting and the fruitful discussions with J. Häberle throughout
the process. Finally, the guideline has been pilot-tested among pediatricians
in training (A. Lämmle, A. Schumann, P. Forny) and by an experienced
general pediatrician (C. Huemer) who all provided valuable feed-back.
Development of this guideline was financially supported through a grant
by the EU 2nd Health Program (DG Sanco) for the European registry and
network for Intoxication type Metabolic Diseases (E-IMD). MRB and MiHo are
