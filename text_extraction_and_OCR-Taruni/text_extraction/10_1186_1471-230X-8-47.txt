Abstract
Background: Partial External Biliary Diversion (PEBD) is a surgical intervention to treat children
with Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis (PFIC) and Alagille syndrome (AGS). PEBD can
reduce disease progression, and examining the alterations in biliary lipid composition may be a
prognostic factor for outcome.
Methods: Biliary lipid composition and the clinical course of AGS and PFIC patients were
examined before and after PEBD.
Results: Pre-PEBD bile from AGS patients had greater chenodeoxycholic/cholic acid (CDCA/CA),
bile salt, cholesterol and phospholipid concentrations than PFIC patients. AGS patients, and PFIC
patients with familial intrahepatic cholestasis 1 (FIC1) genotype, responded better to PEBD than
PFIC patients with bile salt export protein (BSEP) genotype. After successful PEBD, AGS patients
have higher biliary lipid concentrations than PFIC patients and PEBD also increases biliary
phospholipid concentrations in FIC1 patients.
Conclusion: Both AGS and FIC1 patients can benefit from PEBD, and preserved biliary
phospholipid concentrations may be associated with better outcomes post-PEBD.
Background
Genetic liver diseases are common causes of severe
cholestasis and progressive liver disease in children.
Alagille Syndrome (AGS) is a systemic disease caused by
heterozygous mutations in the Jagged 1 gene (JAG1) or
Notch2 gene (NOTCH2) [1,2]. Progressive familial intra￾hepatic cholestasis (PFIC) comprises a group of auto￾somal recessive diseases [3]. Two commonly recognized
forms of PFIC are associated with relatively low serum
GGT [4]: 1) familial intrahepatic cholestasis 1 (FIC1) dis￾ease caused by mutations in ATP8B1 [5] and; 2) bile salt
export protein (BSEP) disease caused by mutations in

ABCB11 [6]. The pathophysiology of cholestasis differs
among these disorders. AGS is associated with a paucity of
interlobular bile ducts while PFIC is associated with
defects in bile transporters.
Partial external biliary diversion (PEBD) has been used to
treat PFIC and AGS [7-9]. PEBD involves the surgical
placement of an enteric conduit between the gallbladder
and the skin through which bile flow is partially diverted
away from the enterohepatic circulation, resulting in an
approximately fifty percent diversion of bile flow [10].
PEBD has been effective in improving chronic cholestasis
and its associated complications. PEBD is not definitively
known to alter the progression of liver disease in AGS,
which progresses to cirrhosis in 20–40% of patients. In
contrast, PEBD has become a standard intervention for
PFIC, which otherwise progresses to cirrhosis and end￾stage liver disease [4,7,10-13]. PEBD may not always
affect the natural progression of either AGS or PFIC, and
no clinical parameters have been defined that predict
patients likely to respond to PEBD.
Biliary lipids include bile salts, cholesterol and phosphol￾ipid. The relative concentrations of hydrophobic to
hydrophilic bile salts is also a major determinant of the
ability to form mixed micelles to maintain the stability of
lipids in suspension. Little is known regarding biliary
lipid composition in genetic cholestasis or the effects of
PEBD, and mouse models of PFIC and AGS unfortunately
differ from the human diseases, likely because the murine
bile salt pool is highly hydrophilic [14,15]. Careful analy￾sis of biliary lipid composition in patients with AGS and
PFIC may improve our understanding of the pathophysi￾ology and treatment of these conditions. We analyzed the
biliary lipid composition in patients with AGS, FIC1 dis￾ease and BSEP disease before and after PEBD to determine
baseline levels, and to determine if composition is predic￾tive of clinical response to PEBD.
Methods
Human Subjects
Patients with PFIC or AGS who underwent PEBD at Chil￾dren's Memorial Hospital, Chicago, IL and the Children's
Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA between 2000
and 2004 constituted the study population. The diagnosis
of AGS was made by a liver biopsy documenting paucity
of interlobular bile ducts in association with at least three
other major features of AGS [16]. The diagnosis of PFIC
was made by the presence of chronic progressive cholesta￾sis in association with low serum GGT [4]. FIC1 and BSEP
disease in the subjects with PFIC were determined by
genetic analysis. Indications for PEBD in AGS patients
included incapacitating pruritus and/or xanthomatosis
refractory to medical therapy, whereas in PFIC it was per￾formed as primary treatment. All patients had been
administered medical therapy consisting of ursodeoxy￾cholic acid in doses of 20 mg/kg without success, as
defined by persistent debilitating pruritus. Clinical data
and bile were collected prospectively and the degree of
pruritus was assessed on a four-point scale [8]. The pruri￾tus score is derived from a combination of patient (when
capable) and parent reports of scratching, the observed
behavior of the child and the child's physical findings. So
that 0 = no scratching, 1 = mild scratching when undis￾tracted without abrasions, 2 = active scratching without
abrasions, 3 = active scratching and abrasions, 4 = cutane￾ous mutilation with bleeding and scarring from scratch￾ing.
Bile samples were obtained intra-operatively from gall￾bladder bile during PEBD and post-operatively from out￾put into ostomy bags. The post-operative collections were
collected first thing in the morning, before a meal, from
the bile that accumulated overnight. Informed consent in
writing was obtained by the parents or legal guardian of
the patients. The study protocol conformed to the ethical
guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki and had
approval of the Institutional Review Board.
Before data analysis, patients were divided into the catego￾ries of clinical "responder" versus "nonresponder" by
these criteria: 1) In "responders", serum bile salt concen￾trations fell below 40 μM/L and/or pruritus score fell ≥2
points; 2) "nonresponders" maintained a serum bile salt
concentrations ≥40 μM/L and/or had ≤ 1 point fall in pru￾ritus, or progressed to end-stage liver disease or received
liver transplantation.
Histological Assessment of Liver Pathology
Microscopy of liver biopsy samples obtained before and/
or at the time of PEBD were analyzed by a blinded liver
pathologist. Sections were stained with hematoxylin/
eosin and Masson's trichrome. Portal-tract fibrosis, peri￾cellular fibrosis, parenchymal changes (giant-cell transfor￾mation, rosetting and pseudoacinus formation,
ballooning of hepatocytes) and degree of cholestasis were
assessed as previously described [17].
Mutational analysis, patients with PFIC
Peripheral blood leukocytes from patients diagnosed with
PFIC and from their parents were collected, with DNA
extracted and evaluated as described [5,18,19]. Children
of Amish origin with extended-family members known to
carry the 923G>T (G308V) "Byler mutation" in ATP8B1
[18] were assessed for homozygosity for this nucleotide
substitution. ABCB11 was sequenced in patients without
an ATP8B1 mutation who lacked BSEP expression on
immunohistochemical study of livers [19], with confir￾mation of patient mutations by analysis of parental DNA.

Analysis of biliary lipid composition
The concentrations of bile salts, cholesterol and phos￾pholipids were measured in bile that was obtained from
patients and stored at -80°C. Stoma bag contents reflected
1–4 hours worth of bile excretion. There was no evidence
of deconjugation of bile salts in the analyzed samples,
indicating that significant metabolism of bile by bacteria
was unlikely. Measurements were performed in triplicate.
Bile salt species were determined by High Performance
Liquid Chromatography according to the method of
Carey and Armstrong [20]. Bile salts were expressed as
ratios of taurine to glycine bile salt conjugates (T/G) and
chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) to cholic acid (CA) spe￾cies (CDCA/CA). Bile salt hydrophobicity index (HI) was
calculated according to the method of Heuman [21]. Fol￾lowing a Folch extraction, bile cholesterol content was
performed using a spectrophotometric assay (Sigma, St.
Louis, MO) and bile phospholipid content was assessed
using the method of Bartlett [22]. The percent change in
serum chemistry value per patient post-PEBD is calculated
as (post-PEBD – pre-PEBD/pre-PEBD) × 100).
Statistics
Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS for Win￾dows (SPSS, Chicago, IL). Data are presented as median
and ranges. Comparisons of baseline characteristics
among groups were performed using the Kruskal-Wallis
test and comparisons within groups before and after
PEBD were performed using the Mann-Whitney U test.
Results
Three unrelated AGS patients and seven children with
PFIC were identified and consented for the study. The
PFIC patients included four Amish children from the
same family with FIC1 disease homozygous for the
923G>T (G308V) mutation in ATP8B1; and three unre￾lated children with BSEP disease that carried two ABCB11
mutations that would disrupt BSEP synthesis or function.
The sequenced mutations included: patient 8 (611+1
G>A/890 A>G (heterozygote), E297G); patient 9
(IVS13del-13^-8/890 A>G (heterozygote), E297G) and
patient 10 (1460 G>C (homozygote), R487P). The
patients were 7.5 ± 6.4 years old (range 0.4 – 18) at the
time of PEBD. The 3 AGS patients were older than the
PFIC patients (15.2 ± 3.27 vs. 3.5 ± 2.49 years, p < 0.001),
whereas FIC1 disease and BSEP disease patients received
PEBD at similar ages (4.25 ± 2.8 vs. 2.53 ± 2.0 years). The
follow-up bile samples were collected at 1.35 ± 0.75 years
after PEBD (range 0.3–2.5 years).
Clinical criteria and response to PEBD
Patients had elevated serum ALT (97, 40 – 265 IU/L) and
bilirubin (4.4, 1.2 – 10.8 mg/dL) concentrations, and
marked pruritus before PEBD (Table 1). All patients had
elevated serum bile acid levels before PEBD (183, 58 –
485 μM/L) with PFIC patients having significantly higher
levels (254, 97 – 485 μM/L) than AGS (81, 58 – 97 μM/L)
(p = 0.01). Pruritus was slightly greater in AGS than PFIC
patients. FIC1 and BSEP disease patients did not differ in
regard to serum bilirubin, ALT, bile salts or level of pruri￾tus. There was no difference in the pre-PEBD serum
bilirubin level, ALT level, bile salt levels or degree of pru￾ritus between patients who responded and those that did
not respond.
Patients had a significant decrease in serum bilirubin (2.8,
0.3 – 6.9 mg/dL) and pruritus score (2, 1 – 4)) after PEBD.
The serum bile acids post-PEBD were significantly lower
with median 24 (21 – 488) μM/L, with the AGS group
being median 24 (21 – 24) μM/L and PFIC group being
median 62 (6 – 488) μM/L. In PFIC responders, the bile
acid level was significantly lower (6.0, 6.0 – 32 μM/L)
than both pre-PEBD levels and the post-PEBD levels of
non-responders (119, 62 – 488 μM/L). AGS patients had
a significant decrease in pruritus. The serum CDCA/CA

ratio post-PEBD was not statistically different among dis￾eases, or among responders versus non-responders.
Overall, three of the 4 FIC1 disease patients had successful
clinical responses to PEBD. The oldest at PEBD (patient 7)
did not respond; 1.7 years after PEBD he had no improve￾ment in pruritus and had evidence of advancing liver dis￾ease with portal hypertension. One of the 3 BSEP disease
patients responded to PEBD while the other two (patients
8 and 9) did not respond.
Histopathologic findings
BSEP disease patients overall had the most aggressive his￾tological changes with prominent pseudoacinar changes
and portal fibrosis (Table 2). Of the PFIC patients with
portal fibrosis grade ≥ 3, one of three were responders,
while of those with fibrosis grade <3, three of four were
responders. Of the 3 BSEP disease patients, the responder
had grade 2 portal fibrosis, whereas the two non-respond￾ers had grade 2 and 4 fibrosis. Only one AGS patient had
undergone biopsy at the time of PEBD (patient 1).
Lipid composition of bile
The bile from PFIC patients had significantly lower con￾centrations of all biliary lipids (bile salts, cholesterol and
phospholipids) and a lower ratio of chenodeoxycholic
acid (CDCA) to cholic acid (CA) than AGS patients (Fig￾ure 1), (p < 0.05). The ratio of taurine to glycine bile salt
conjugates in bile and the hydrophobicity index was not
different between PFIC and AGS patients.
Bile from FIC1 disease and BSEP disease patients were not
different in regard to total bile salt, cholesterol and phos￾pholipid content. They differed significantly, however, in
the percent ursodeoxycholic acid enrichment and hydro￾phobicity. BSEP disease patients had median 37, range 29
to 60% ursodeoxycholic acid enrichment compared to
median 2.29, range 0.9 to 4.2 in FIC1 disease patients (p
= 0.05). As a result, the hydrophobicity index of bile was
median -0.15, range -0.05 to -0.26 in BSEP disease
patients vs. median 0.035, range 0.001 to 0.07 in FIC1
patients (p= 0.02). The pre-PEBD biliary lipid composi￾tion of PFIC patients who responded to PEBD was not sig￾nificantly different from non-responders.
The data regarding the percent change in biliary lipid
composition after PEBD are presented in Figure 2 and the
individual data in Figure 3. AGS patients showed no sig￾nificant change in biliary lipid composition after PEBD.
Patients with FIC1 disease showed a 4-fold increase in bil￾iary phospholipid content after PEBD (median 1.3, range
0.3 to 2.6 mM, to median 4.9, range 0.9 to 6.0 mM, p =
0.05), and a trend towards an increased CDCA/CA ratio
(median 0.00, range 0.00 to 0.07 to median 0.10, range
0.00 to 0.29, p = 0.10). BSEP patients had no significant
increase in biliary lipids and had no detectable biliary
CDCA post-PEBD, resulting in a decreased CDCA/CA
ratio (median 0.00, 0.00 to 0.13 to median 0.0, range 0.0
to 0.0).
PFIC responders showed a trend toward increased bile salt
concentration and CDCA/CA ratio in bile after PEBD,
although these did not reach statistical significance (Fig￾ure 3), but no increase in cholesterol and phospholipid
content. In 2 of 3 PFIC non-responders there was a com￾plete absence of CDCA in bile after 1 year of diversion.
AGS patients continued to have higher biliary lipid con￾centrations after PEBD than PFIC patients, both respond￾ers and non-responders.
Long-term outcomes after successful PEBD
Patients 4 and 5 had the best outcomes, with relief of
cholestasis and marked reduction in serum bilirubin lev￾els. Patient 6 developed severe pancreatitis associated with
multi-organ system failure and death 2 years after PEBD.
Patient 7 died shortly after liver transplantation. Patient 8

underwent successful liver transplantation 2.5 years after
PEBD for massive ostomy output, and patient 9 devel￾oped hepatocellular carcinoma 1.6 years post-PEBD and
died (previously reported in reference 19). Thus, only two
of this group of PFIC patients survived with PEBD to dem￾onstrate long-term benefit. All three AGS patients have
had good long-term outcome.
Discussion
Biliary lipid compositions of children with PFIC and AGS
remain poorly understood, and these data demonstrate
that they differ according to disease. The biliary lipid com￾position of AGS patients was essentially normal, whereas
bile from PFIC patients contained minimal biliary lipids.
This likely reflects the differing pathophysiology of the
diseases. The bile from PFIC patients with FIC1 genotype
and BSEP genotype both had very low lipid concentra￾tions but were not significantly different from each other.
This may reflect similar mechanisms of cholestasis in both
types of low-GGT PFIC, with a primary impairment of
transporter expression and function. It should be noted
that this study examined lipid concentrations in bile,
rather than secretion rates. In addition, pre-PEBD bile was
obtained from the gallbladder, while post-PEBD bile was
obtained from the stoma.
After clinically successful PEBD, the bile composition of
FIC1 patients had a four-fold increase in phospholipid
content without changes in bile salts or cholesterol. The
bile remained relatively normal in AGS patients and no
significant changes were noted in BSEP patients. Lipid
content of all PFIC patients who responded to PEBD dem￾onstrated a trend to increased bile salt, cholesterol and
CDCA/CA content after PEBD, although these did not
reach statistical significance. There were a limited number
of patients with these rare diseases and significant varia￾bility between the human subjects, so one cannot exclude
the possibility that increases in the concentrations of these
lipids could not be detected in this study. Also, given that
there was significant homogeneity in the FIC1 patients
who shared the same mutation compared to the BSEP
patients who were unrelated with distinct mutations, it is
possible that the specific mutation in the FIC1 patients
may intrinsically be associated with a milder disease and
more favorable outcome in this study. We were unable to
identify any other parameters such as age at diversion, his￾tological stage or liver function levels before diversion
that served as prognostic indicators for success in PFIC
patients undergoing PEBD.
Baseline bile lipid content at PEBD differed in composi￾tion between AGS patients and PFIC patients; differences
likely reflecting differences in the etiology of cholestasis
[23]. In AGS, the paucity of interlobular bile ducts (fewer
than 0.4 bile ducts per portal area) [24] is believed to
underlie cholestasis by causing obstruction of biliary
drainage. Sixty to eighty percent of hepatic lobules lack
biliary drainage while remaining capable of producing
bile, more in the periphery than the core [25]. AGS
patients have serum values characteristic of biliary
obstruction with markedly elevated serum cholesterol,
bile salts, and lipoprotein-X values, presumably due to
reflux of bile constituents from canaliculi and ductules
with inadequate bile drainage [26-28]. Our findings sug￾gest that patients with AGS make normal bile similar to
that reported for normal children [29]. Thus, it appears
that cholestasis in AGS is due to excreting too little "nor￾mal bile" or retaining too much. The ability of AGS
patients' hepatocytes to make and secrete bile may protect
them from cellular cholestasis and cholate injury, and
provides a putative explanation why progressive liver dis￾ease is relatively uncommon [30].
Compared to AGS bile, PFIC bile contains very low con￾centrations of lipid. This finding reflects the functions of
the PFIC gene products, FIC1 and BSEP, which are pivotal
in canalicular bile formation. The potentially resultant
effect on PFIC serum levels is a relatively lower cholesterol
concentration and absence of lipoprotein-X [31,32]. The
low molar ratio of CDCA/CA in PFIC bile likely reflects
the relatively poor excretion of hydrophobic bile salts
[7,33], which is evidenced by the preponderance of CDCA
in the serum of these patients [4,34,35], although a caus￾ative relationship remains speculative.
The bile composition of AGS patients does not change
after successful PEBD. Dramatically lower serum choles￾terol values in AGS patients after successful PEBD [9]
probably reflect shunting of cholesterol to bile acid syn￾thesis, similar to the effect of oral bile acid binding resins
on serum cholesterol in hypercholesterolemia [36]. In
AGS, PEBD may simply shunt bile away from the entero￾hepatic circulation, without fundamentally changing pri￾mary hepatobiliary function.
Conclusion
In this study, we relate the outcome of PEBD and the
results of biliary lipid analysis to the specific subsets of
genetically defined PFIC. In FIC1 patients, there was an
increase in phospholipid content and trend toward an
increase in CDCA/CA, although the latter affect did not
reach statistical significance. A positive clinical response
to naso-biliary drainage has been observed in patients
with benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis (BRIC),
also due to a defect in FIC1 [37].
In conclusion, our study confirms that the biliary lipid
concentration in patients with AGS is higher than in
patients with PFIC. In addition, PEBD can relieve
cholestasis in AGS without changing bile composition;

and improves phospholipid content in the bile of FIC1
patients. Larger scale comparisons of these populations
with consideration for the effects of specific gene defects
on outcome of PEBD will be necessary before definitive
conclusions of prognosis can be derived.

and analyzed the samples, performed the statistical analy￾sis and drafted the manuscript. ME carried out the sample
analysis and participated in the interpretation and analy￾sis of the data. HMA reviewed the liver biopsies and devel￾oped the grading scale used in quantifying histological
changes for the analysis and helped to revise the manu￾script. SS, RT and LB carried out the molecular genetic
studies as well as participated in the drafting and revising
of the manuscript for important intellectual content. AK
made substantial contributions to the analysis and inter￾pretation of the data. PFW designed the study with KE and
was the leader in the conception of the project, its design
and ultimately the interpretation of the results. RG super￾vised the study, provided his laboratory equipment, sup￾plies and technical help to perform the bile analysis and
made substantial contributions to the acquisition, analy￾sis and interpretation of the data as well as in drafting the
manuscript. All authors read and approved the final man￾uscript.
