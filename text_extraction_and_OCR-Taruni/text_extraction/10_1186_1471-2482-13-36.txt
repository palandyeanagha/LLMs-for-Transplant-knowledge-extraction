Abstract
Background: Parathyroid hormone (PTH) monitoring during the surgical procedure can confirm the removal of all
hyperfunctioning parathyroid tissue, as the half-life of PTH is approximately 5 min. The commonly applied Irvin
criterion is reported to correctly predict post-operative calcium levels in 96-98% of patients. However, the PTH
baseline reference concentration is markedly influenced by surgical manipulations during preparation of the
affected glands, interindividual variability of the PTH half-life and modifications in the physiological state of the
patient during surgery. The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible impact of the measurement of
intraoperative PTH 20 minutes after surgery.
Methods: Between 2003 and 2012, 188 patients underwent a focused parathyroidectomy associated to rapid
intraoperative PTH assay monitoring. Blood samples were collected: 1) at pre-incision time, 2) at 10 min after gland
excision and 3) at 20 min after excision, if a sufficient reduction of PTH value was not observed. On the bases of the
Irvin criterion, an intra-operative PTH drop>50% from the highest either pre-incision or pre-excision level after
parathyroid excision was considered a surgical success.
Results: A >50% decrease of PTH after gland excision compared to the highest pre-excision value occurred in
156/188 patients (83%) within 10 min and in further 12/188 after 20 minutes (6.4%). In the remaining 20 patients
(10.6%) values of PTH remained substantially unchanged or decreased less than 50% and for this reason bilateral
neck exploration was performed. An additional pathologic parathyroid was removed in 9 cases, a third in one. In
the other 10 cases further neck exploration by a standard cervical approach was negative and in four of these
persistent postoperative hypercalcemia was demonstrated. The overall operative success was 97.3%. Intraoperative
PTH monitoring was accurate in predicting operative success or failure in 96.3% of patients.
Conclusions: The 20 minutes PTH measurement appears very useful, avoiding unnecessary bilateral exploration and
the related risk of complications with only a slight increase of the duration of surgery and of the costs. PTH values
decreasing appeared to be influenced by surgical manipulations during minimally invasive parathyroidectomy.

Background
Primary hyperparathyroidism is a common condition
caused by single or multiple parathyroid lesions [1,2]; it
is rare below the age of 50 years but rises thereafter, par￾ticularly in women; surgery offers the only definitive
treatment [2].
The aim of parathyroidectomy is to establish normo￾calcaemia trying to avoid complications such as persis￾tent or recurrent hyperparathyroidism, postoperative
transient or persistent hypoparathyroidism and recurrent
laryngeal nerve injury [2].
Primary hyperparathyroidism has traditionally been
managed by bilateral neck exploration and identification
of the four parathyroid glands with a success rate of
more than 95% when performed by experienced endo￾crine surgeons [2-6].
The traditional surgical approach with the visualization
of all parathyroid glands and the resection of apparently
enlarged glands has been increasingly replaced by minim￾ally invasive (unilateral) surgical procedures, supported by
preoperative imaging and rapid intraoperative parathyroid
hormone (PTH) assay measurement [4,6-8].
However, 5% to 20% of patients with primary hyper￾parathyroidism have multiglandular disease and require
bilateral neck exploration; in such cases, imaging studies
can be misleading [6].
PTH monitoring during the surgical procedure can con￾firm the removal of all hyperfunctioning parathyroid tis￾sue, as the half-life of PTH is approximately 5 min [2-4,7].
An insufficient decrease in PTH indicates persisting pri￾mary hyperparathyroidism, leading to more extended (bi￾lateral) exploration within the same session [3,4,7].
The commonly applied Irvin criterion (rapid intra￾operative PTH assay drop ≥ 50% from the highest value
of either pre-incision or pre-excision level at 10 min
after gland excision) is reported to correctly predict
post-operative calcium levels in 96-98% of patients and
incorrectly in only 2-4% [3,6,7,9]. Some authors suggest
to fulfill various percentage drop versus pre-incision or
pre-excision PTH, 5-10 min after resection of the
suspected parathyroid adenoma, or to reach a final PTH
concentration within the normal range [3,4].
However, the PTH baseline reference concentration is
markedly influenced by surgical manipulations during
preparation of the affected glands, interindividual vari￾ability of the PTH half-life and modifications in the
physiological state of the patient during surgery (such as
changes of clearing rate or expanded volume of intra￾operative infusions) [4,7,10].
Some authors have reported error rates of as much as
16% due to false-negative and false-positive results [3,11].
The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of the
measurement of intraoperative PTH 20 minutes after
surgery.
Methods
We conducted a retrospective study on 239 patients oper￾ated on for primary hyperparathyroidism in our surgical
department between May 2003 and December 2012. 202
patients were female and 37 were male, median age was
58 years (range 19-85). Before operation hypercalcemia
and elevated PTH levels were observed in all patients.
In order to localize hyperfunctioning glands, a TC99m￾sestamibi scan (MIBI) was performed in 191 patients
(79.9%): pathologic parathyroid was localized in 178 cases
(93.2%). High resolution ultrasound was associated in 233
patients and pathologic parathyroid was localized in 146
(62.7%). Association of ultrasound and 99m Tc-sestamibi
scan localized hyperfunctioning parathyroid in 163/174
patients (93.7%). SPECT-TC was performed on 140 pa￾tients and hyperfunctioning parathyroid was localized in
134 (95.7%). Association of SPECT-TC and ultrasonog￾raphy localized hyperfunctioning parathyroid in 121/122
patients (99.2%).
188 patients underwent a focused parathyroidectomy as￾sociated to a rapid intraoperative PTH assay monitoring.
All patients had normal renal function (serum creatinine
value ranging from 0.7 to 1.2 mg/dL) and gave informed
consent for the procedure. All operations were performed
under general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation and
by the same team of surgeons, who were highly experi￾enced in parathyroid surgery. Blood samples were col￾lected: 1) at pre-incision time, 2) at 10 min after gland
excision and 3) at 20 min after excision, if a sufficient
reduction of PTH value was not observed. The STAT￾IntraOperative-Intact-PTH Chemilluminescence immuno￾assay semiautomated mobile system (Future Diagnostics,
Wijchen, Netherlands) was used within the surgical suite
complex for the intraoperative quantitative determination
of PTH levels in EDTA plasma.
The study has been performed in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki. Ethical approval for our study
was obtained from institutional ethical committee of
Monserrato University Hospital, Cagliari, Italy. Informed
consent was obtained from participants for their inclu￾sion in our study.
On the bases of the Irvin criterion, an intra-operative
PTH drop >50% from the highest either pre-incision or
pre-excision level after parathyroid excision was consid￾ered a surgical success. A PTH drop of <50% from the
highest basal value within 20 min after gland excision
and/or a residual PTH-20 min level higher than the ref￾erence range were considered predictor of persistent
hyperfunctioning parathyroid tissue and further surgical
exploration was required.
Results
A >50% decrease of PTH within 10 min compared to the
highest pre-excision value occurred in 156/188 patients

(83%). In 12 patients >50% decrease of PTH was obtained
after 20 minutes (6.4%) (Table 1). The characteristics of
the 12 patients of this group are shown in Table 2. Total
>50% decrease of PTH within 20 minutes was obtained in
168/188 patients (89.4%); postoperative normal calcemia
and PTH were found in 167 patients and persistent post￾operative hypercalcemia with increased value of PTH was
found in 1 patient. In the remaining 20 patients (10.6%)
values of PTH remained substantially unchanged or de￾creased less than 50%. In these patients the surgical pro￾cedure went on and bilateral neck exploration was
performed. An additional pathologic parathyroid was re￾moved in 9 cases, a third in one case. In these cases
histology exams showed hyperplasia in 5 cases, double ad￾enoma in 4 and single adenoma associated to hyperplasia
in 1. In the other 10 cases further neck exploration by a
standard cervical approach was negative and in four of
these persistent postoperative hypercalcemia was demon￾strated, whereas in six patients postoperative normal
calcemia and PTH were found.
Final histology showed a parathyroid adenoma in 150
patients, hyperplasia in 35, carcinoma in 3.
The overall operative success was 97.3%, with a 4.8%
incidence of multiglandular disease (9 cases).
Median duration of surgery was 60 minutes (range
40-80). Surgical complications have been observed in 3
patients: 2 transient recurrent laryngeal nerve paresis
and 1 hematoma necessitating reoperation. Transient
hypocalcemia occurred in 24 cases (12.7%) and was
treated with calcium and vitamin D per os with resolution
within 1 month. No cases of permanent hypocalcemia
were observed. There were no wound complications and
no perioperative deaths.
Median postoperative recovery was 2 days (range 1-3).
Intraoperative PTH monitoring was accurate in predic￾ting operative success or failure in 96.3% of cases. Thus
the method had a sensitivity of 96.5%, a specificity of
93.3%, a positive predictive value of 99.4% and a negative
predictive value of 70% (Table 3).
We compared the characteristics of patients in which
there was a >50% decrease of PTH within 10 minutes
(group A) to those with no decrease or late decrease
(group B). We found no significant difference for the age
and for preoperative localization studies, while the mean
value of baseline PTH was significantly lower in the first
group (Table 4).
Discussion
Currently, the success rate of parathyroidectomy is greater
than 95% in centers experienced in this procedure and
complications are rare [2,12,13].
Intraoperative PTH monitoring is a necessary adjunct
to detect multiglandular disease in patients undergoing
minimally invasive surgery for primary hyperparathyr￾oidism [14]. Pitfalls may occur due to technical assay
problems or blood sampling errors [10]. In particular,
blood collection timing appears to be a critical step [4].
Difficulties or unexpected outcomes can be encoun￾tered in patients with renal insufficiency and when PTH
spikes with consecutive delayed PTH reduction occur by
unintended manipulation of parathyroid adenomas dur￾ing mobilization [10]. In particular, during minimally
invasive parathyroidectomy, the manipulations by the
surgeons influence the PTH concentrations values until
parathyroidectomy obviously to a larger extent than with
conventional techniques. The preparation of the affected
gland within a small unilateral 1.5-cm skin incision may
cause squeezing of the glands as a result of mobilization
or untimely clamping of small vessels. Extirpation of the
adenoma no doubt stopped its PTH efflux into circula￾tion, irrespective of a previous stepwise clamping [7]. If
unintended manipulation results in a PTH peak, the
PTH decay is not exponential, and the criterion of 50%
reduction of the pre-incision baseline level is delayed to
more than 10 min in most patients after extensive ma￾nipulation. The PTH decay after manipulation may be
even prolonged in patients with impaired renal function
[10,15,16].
A slow decrease in PTH may also be caused by a
prolonged half-life and not necessarily by additional
hyperfunctioning glands [7].
Prolonged PTH monitoring at 20 min was suggested
by some authors which found that the best predictors of
operative failure and persistent (multiglandular) disease

are a PTH drop of <50% at 20 min and/or a residual
(at 20 min) PTH level above the normal range and/or a
significant increase of the PTH levels between the sample
obtained 20 min after gland excision with the respect to
the 10-min samples [3,4,17,18].
We performed PTH measurement after 10 minutes
and if a sufficient decrease of PTH value was not ob￾served after 20 minutes: only after this second measure￾ment we perform bilateral exploration. In 12 patients
(6.4%) >50% decrease of PTH was observed only after
20 minutes and an unnecessary bilateral exploration was
thus avoided. None of the 12 patients had impaired renal
function nor other comorbidities, so the delayed nor￾malization of PTH appears to be probably caused by the
excessive manipulation during the minimally invasive
parathyroidectomy.
In 6 patients, in which a >50% decrease of PTH in the
20 min sample was not obtained, postoperative normal
calcemia and PTH were found. In these cases, it is pos￾sible that a further sample after 30 minutes could have
obtained a >50% decrease. Possible explanations for
these unexpected outcomes are technical assay problems
or blood sampling errors; in particular unintended ma￾nipulation with a PTH spike could have resulted in a
delay of more than 20 minutes.
Baseline PTH values in patients without decrease or
with late decrease of PTH were significantly smaller than
those with a >50% decrease of PTH within 10 min. The
reason for this is not clear: it could be attributable to
PTH peaks due to manipulations that can obviously have
a more significant effect in patients with lower baseline
PTH values; moreover, lower PTH values generally cor￾respond to smaller parathyroid and more difficulties in
their intraoperative localization.
Our results are similar to those reported in literature
[4-6,17] showing an accuracy in predicting operative suc￾cess or failure in 96.3% of cases, a sensitivity of 96.5%, a
specificity of 93.3%, a positive predictive value of 99.4%
and a negative predictive value of 70%. Our incidence of
multiglandular diseases (4.8%) was instead only slightly
lower than that reported in literature (5-20%) [3,6,8,19],
and in these cases a correct diagnosis and a proper treat￾ment have been obtained.
Conclusions
Our approach with the PTH 20 minutes measurement
when the value does not decrease significantly at 10 mi￾nutes made it possible to achieve a significant accuracy,
sensitivity and specificity of the method avoiding un￾necessary bilateral explorations and associated complica￾tions in patients undergoing minimally invasive surgery.
Duration of surgery and related costs were only minim￾ally increased.
Monitoring of the PTH decay appeared to be influenced
by surgical manipulations during the more difficult aden￾oma preparation in minimally invasive parathyroidectomy.
The 20 minutes end-point seems to play a key role in
the correct determination of surgical outcome, strongly
improving the possibility of performing correct patient
treatment.
So the 20 minutes PTH measurement appears very
useful, avoiding unnecessary bilateral exploration and
the related risk of complications with only a slight in￾crease of the duration of surgery and its costs.
