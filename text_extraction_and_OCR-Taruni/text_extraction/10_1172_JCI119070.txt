Abstract
Myocardial infarcts heal by scarring because myocardium
cannot regenerate. To determine if skeletal myoblasts could
establish new contractile tissue, hearts of adult inbred rats
were injured by freeze-thaw, and 3–4.5 3 106
 neonatal skel￾etal muscle cells were transplanted immediately thereafter.
At 1 d the graft cells were proliferating and did not express
myosin heavy chain (MHC). By 3 d, multinucleated myo￾tubes were present which expressed both embryonic and
fast fiber MHCs. At 2 wk, electron microscopy demon￾strated possible satellite stem cells. By 7 wk the grafts began
expressing b-MHC, a hallmark of the slow fiber phenotype; co￾expression of embryonic, fast, and b-MHC continued through
3 mo. Transplanting myoblasts 1 wk after injury yielded com￾parable results, except that grafts expressed b-MHC sooner
(by 2 wk). Grafts never expressed cardiac-specific MHC-a.
Wounds containing 2-wk-old myoblast grafts contracted
when stimulated ex vivo, and high frequency stimulation in￾duced tetanus. Furthermore, the grafts could perform a car￾diac-like duty cycle, alternating tetanus and relaxation, for
at least 6 min. Thus, skeletal myoblasts can establish new
muscle tissue when grafted into injured hearts, and this
muscle can contract when stimulated electrically. Because
the grafts convert to fatigue-resistant, slow twitch fibers,
this new muscle may be suited to a cardiac work load. (J.

Introduction
Experimental and clinical therapies for myocardial infarction
have focused traditionally on limiting infarct size. Unfortu￾nately, the goal of limiting myocardial injury has been difficult
to achieve clinically, because ischemic myocardium dies quite
rapidly (1) and most patients wait more than 3 h after coronary
occlusion before seeking medical attention. As an alternative
approach, we are exploring strategies to induce the injured
heart to heal with muscle replacement rather than forming
scar tissue.
One strategy for muscle regeneration is to transplant either
skeletal or cardiac myocytes into the injured heart. Studies
from Field’s group showed that cardiac myocytes can be trans￾planted into normal hearts, where they couple with host cardio￾cytes via intercalated discs (2, 3). However, a major drawback
to using cardiocytes is their inability to proliferate in culture.
At present it seems unlikely that enough primary cardiocytes
could be obtained from the patient or histocompatible donor
to repair a myocardial infarct in humans. On the other hand,
skeletal muscle satellite cells (muscle stem cells) proliferate
well in culture. Satellite cells could be obtained from muscles
of infarct patients and rapidly expanded in culture, or stocks of
potentially therapeutic myoblasts could be obtained from em￾bryos and frozen for subsequent use (4, 5). Furthermore, phys￾iological studies have shown that when properly conditioned,
skeletal muscle can adapt to perform a cardiac-type work load
(6). Recent studies have demonstrated the feasibility of graft￾ing skeletal myoblast lines into normal hearts (7) and autolo￾gous satellite cells into injured hearts (8, 9). However, to
generate significant amounts of functional new muscle the
transplanted cells ideally should proliferate and then differen￾tiate into mature myofibers capable of sustaining a cardiac
work load. This study was performed to determine the prolif￾eration and differentiation patterns of skeletal myoblasts after
engraftment into injured rat hearts and to determine whether
this new muscle could support contractile activity.
Methods
Skeletal myoblast isolation and culture. These studies were approved
by the University of Washington Animal Care Committee and were
conducted in accordance with federal guidelines. Skeletal myoblasts
were obtained from the limbs of 1–3-d-old Fischer rats. This inbred
strain was used to avoid immune barriers to transplantation. After
time of killing, the carcasses were skinned and the limbs were placed
into cold tissue culture media. Under a dissecting microscope, the
muscles were stripped of surrounding adipose tissue and fascia and
bluntly dissected from their tendons. The muscles were minced with
iridectomy scissors until a fine slurry was formed. The slurry was then
digested in 0.05% trypsin/EDTA (GIBCO-BRL, Gaithersburg, MD)
in Ham’s saline A at 378C, with intermittent mechanical agitation to
assist dispersal. After 30–45 min the cell suspension was filtered
through sterile gauze to remove undispersed tissue fragments and rod
shaped mature myofibers. Cells were plated at z 5 3 106
 cells/dish in
100-mm gelatinized plates in 10 ml Ham’s F10C media, containing
15% horse serum and 50 mg/ml gentamicin sulfate (Gemini Bioprod￾ucts, Inc., Calabasas, CA). Recombinant human basic fibroblast
growth factor was added twice daily to a final concentration of 6 ng/ml,
and the complete medium was replaced once per day. Approximately
10% of the cells attached and grew with a doubling time of z 18 h.
The cultures contained a mix of small, oval myoblasts and elongated,
spindle-shaped cells consistent with fibroblasts. Subconfluent cultures
were passaged every 2–3 d (1:5 split) to minimize the occurrence of
myogenic differentiation at higher density. On the day before trans￾plantation, the cultures were tagged for subsequent identification in
vivo. In some experiments cells were tagged with fluorescent micro￾Address correspondence to Charles E. Murry, M.D., Ph.D., Depart￾ment of Pathology, Box 357470, Room E-520, HSB, University of

spheres (1:500 dilution of stock 200 nm yellow-green fluorescent mi￾crospheres; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The latex microspheres
were endocytosed (typically . 20 spheres/cell) and served as cyto￾plasmic markers (10). In other experiments, cells were incubated
overnight with [3H]thymidine (1 mCi/ml) to mark their nuclei after
autoradiography. Cultures were trypsinized immediately before trans￾plantation and suspended at a concentration of z 3 3 107
/ml. Small
aliquots of the remaining cell suspension were replated at z 2 3 104
cells/cm2
 into gelatinized, multichamber plastic slides, and fixed in
methanol after various culture intervals for immunostaining.
Rat cardiac injury models. Inbred male Fischer rats (Simonsen Labs,
Gilroy, CA) weighing 350–400 grams were anesthetized with intra￾peritoneal ketamine-xylazine (68 and 4.4 mg/kg, respectively), intu￾bated, and mechanically ventilated with room air. The heart was ex￾posed aseptically via a left thoracotomy, and a 1-cm-diameter
aluminum rod, precooled with liquid nitrogen, was placed in direct
contact with the anterior left ventricle for 15 s. Freeze-thaw reproduc￾ibly caused a disc-shaped region of coagulation necrosis, z 1 cm in di￾ameter, extending z 2 mm into the myocardium. It should be noted
that while infarcts typically have irregular borders with viable penin￾sulas of subepicardial myocardium along penetrating vessels, freeze￾thaw lesions consist of confluent necrosis in the subepicardium with
viable myocardium in the subendocardium. Because they are not
transmural, freeze-thaw lesions do not cause cardiac aneurysm for￾mation. Despite these differences, the cellular patterns of coagulation
necrosis, inflammation and phagocytosis, granulation tissue forma￾tion, and scarring after freeze-thaw injury are indistinguishable from
myocardial infarction (11–13), making it a suitable model to study
myocardial repair.
In the initial studies, z 3 3 106
 myoblasts in 100 ml tissue culture
media were injected superficially into the center of the injured region
immediately after injury, using a 27-gauge needle. Then, the chest
was closed and the rats were allowed to recover for timed intervals
from 1 d to 3 mo (n 5 4/time point). To mimic a clinical situation
more closely, a second protocol was used in which the freeze-thaw le￾sion was allowed to heal for 1 wk before transplanting myoblasts. By
1 wk, most of the necrotic myocardium had been replaced by granula￾tion tissue, but scar formation had not yet begun. The rats (n 5 2/time
point; no 3 d or 3 mo time points) were reanesthetized and a thora￾cotomy was repeated. The heart was exposed and a 100-ml suspension
containing z 3 3 106
 myoblasts was injected into the wound as de￾scribed above. The chest was closed and the animals were allowed to
recover for intervals from 1 d to 7 wk.
To detect DNA synthesis in the grafts the rats were treated with
the thymidine analogue 5-bromo-29-deoxyuridine (BrdU)1
 (Boeh￾ringer-Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN). 1 d before time of killing, the
rats were lightly anesthetized, and a 50-mg tablet of BrdU was im￾planted subcutaneously for measurement of cell replication. Prelimi￾nary studies showed that a subcutaneous 50-mg BrdU tablet gave
comparable replication rates to a 24-h continuous infusion with an os￾motic mini-pump (not shown). For rats killed 1 d after transplanta￾tion, a single 10-mg pulse of BrdU was given intraperitoneally 1 h be￾fore time of killing. This avoided incorporation of BrdU into the cells
which were cycling at the time of transplantation.
Rats were killed with a pentobarbital overdose and their hearts
were excised. In the immediate transplantation groups, the aorta was
cannulated and the hearts were perfusion fixed with methyl Carnoy’s
solution (60% methanol, 30% chloroform, 10% glacial acetic acid),
transversely sectioned, and embedded in paraffin by routine meth￾ods. In groups transplanted 1 wk after injury, the hearts were trans￾versely sectioned, embedded in OCT (Miles Inc., Kankakee, IL), and
frozen in a dry ice–ethanol bath for frozen section analysis. In both
protocols, sections of gut were obtained as controls for measurement
of cell replication with BrdU.
Measurement of contractile function in isolated wound strips. Rat
hearts were given 4.5 3 106
 myoblasts (n 5 8) in 100 ml or a sham in￾jection of saline (n 5 3) immediately after injury. 2 wk after engrafting,
the hearts were excised and transversely sectioned. Under a dissecting
microscope, most of the subendocardial myocardium was trimmed away
from the injured region, and isolated wound strips (z 1.5 3 1.5 3 8 mm)
were prepared. One or two strips were studied from each myoblast￾engrafted heart, and two or three strips were studied from each sham￾injected heart. The strips were ligated at both ends with silk suture
and then placed in a bath of physiological saline with the following
composition (mmol/liter): 116 NaCl, 4.6 KCl, 1.2 MgSO4
, 2.5 CaCl2
,
26 Mops (pH 7.4), 11 glucose, and 10 mg/liter gentamicin. The buffer
was equilibrated with 95% O2
/5% CO2
 and maintained at 208C via a
thermostatically controlled water jacket. Wound strips were mounted
between an isometric force transducer (model 60-2995; Harvard Ap￾paratus, Inc., South Natick, MA) and a fixed glass hook. Resting ten￾sion was set initially at 0.5 g. Strips were stimulated with 1-ms bipolar
pulses delivered via platinum wire electrodes using a Grass model
S48 stimulator (Astro-Med, Inc., West Warwick, RI). Voltage was in￾creased in 10-V increments until contractile activity was observed.
Force traces were displayed on a digital storage oscilloscope (model
3091; Nicolet Instrument Corp., Madison, WI) and recorded using a
General Scanning model RS4-5P strip chart recorder. After deter￾mining the force–voltage relationship, the optimal length for force
production was determined for each wound strip using test contrac￾tions at 2-min intervals, a time sufficient for metabolic recovery in
mammalian fast twitch muscles (14). Force–frequency analysis was
performed by increasing the stimulation frequency in 1-Hz incre￾ments; tetanus was defined as the point where the oscillations of con￾tractile force at the plateau were , 3% of the net force generated
(14). Finally, to test fatigability the grafts were subjected to a simu￾lated cardiac-like duty cycle, consisting of 0.33 s of tetanus followed
by 0.67 s of relaxation (1:2 cycle), continuing for 6 min. After comple￾tion of functional studies the strip’s cross-sectional area was deter￾mined, and the tissue then was processed for histology or electron mi￾croscopy.
Immunocytochemistry. Antibodies used for immunostaining are
given in Table I. 6-mm frozen sections were cut on a cryostat, briefly
air dried, and stored at 2708C until use. 5-mm paraffin sections were
deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated in a graded alcohol series.
Cultured cells were fixed and stored in cold PBS until use. For all
samples, endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched by incubating
with 0.3% H2O2
 in methanol for 30 min. Immunostaining was carried
out at room temperature. Sections were blocked with 1.5% normal
horse serum in PBS for 1 h. The sections were then incubated with
the primary antibody in 1.5% horse serum for 1 h, followed by incu￾bation with the secondary antibody (rat adsorbed horse anti–mouse,
1:400 dilution; Vector Labs, Inc., Burlingame, CA) for 1 h. Antigens
were localized with an avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (ABC Elite
kit; Vector Labs). For staining with a single antibody, diaminobenzi￾dine (Sigma Immunochemicals, St. Louis, MO) was used as a chroma￾genic substrate. For double immunolabeling with antibodies to myo￾sin and BrdU, sections were first exposed to 1.5 N HCl for 15 min at
378C to denature the DNA, followed by a rinse in 0.1 mol/liter borax
to stabilize the denatured strands. Sections were then stained rou￾tinely for myosin heavy chain (MHC) using diaminobenzidine. After
a second quenching in 0.3% H2O2
, sections were blocked with 1.5%
normal horse serum, and then incubated with a mouse monoclonal
antibody to BrdU for 1 h. After incubation with the secondary anti￾body (horse anti–mouse), BrdU was localized with an avidin-biotin￾peroxidase complex, using True Blue (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD) as
substrate. Cross-reactivity between the first primary antibody and the
second secondary antibody did not occur, as long as the True Blue
substrate was incubated for a short duration (, 1 min). Sections were
counterstained either with methyl green, nuclear fast red, or hema￾toxylin.
Electron microscopy. After measurement of contractile function,
one of the tissue strips was immersed in half strength Karnovsky’s fix￾1. Abbreviations used in this paper: BrdU, 5-bromo-29deoxyuridine;

The tissue was fixed overnight in half strength Karnovsky’s fixative,
postfixed for 1 h in 1% osmium tetroxide at room temperature, dehy￾drated through a graded alcohol series followed by propylene oxide,
and embedded in Medcast resin (Ted Pella, Inc., Redding, CA).
Semithin sections were stained with toluidine blue and examined by
light microscopy. Thin sections were cut from selected blocks, stained
with lead citrate and uranyl acetate, and examined in a Jeol JEM
1200EXII transmission electron microscope. Representative areas
were photographed.
Results
Characteristics of myoblast cultures. The muscle cultures con￾tained a mixed cell population. At least 22% of the cells were
skeletal muscle, as indicated by their staining for sarcomeric
myosin after switching to a differentiation medium containing
1.5% serum and no FGF for 3 d. This procedure underesti￾mates the true percentage of skeletal muscle cells by several￾fold, since the nonmyogenic cells continue to divide after the
medium switch while the myoblasts complete their present cell
cycle and then terminally differentiate. Approximately 1% of
the cells stained with antibodies to smooth muscle a-actin,
which can mark either smooth muscle cells or fibroblasts. Vir￾tually none of the cells stained with an antibody for the endo￾thelial marker von Willebrand factor. The remaining cells
were presumably fibroblasts.
Histology and differentiation patterns of myoblast grafts.
Cultured skeletal myoblasts were transplanted into cardiac
freeze-thaw lesions either immediately after injury, or, to
mimic a clinical situation more closely, cells were transplanted
1 wk after injury. The two protocols yielded similar results and
will be described together; minor differences are noted below.
On the first day after transplantation the myoblasts were
mononuclear cells (Fig. 1 A). The grafted cells could be distin￾guished clearly from inflammatory cells within the necrotic tis￾sue by their larger size and characteristic oval shape. (Fibro￾blast ingrowth from the surrounding tissue had not yet begun
at this time.) The identity of the grafted cells was confirmed by
their cytoplasmic fluorescent microspheres and radioactive nu￾clei (not shown). Mitotic figures were common. The grafted
cells did not stain with antibodies to skeletal or cardiac MHCs
(Fig. 1 B). Thus, muscle differentiation had not yet occurred.
By 3 d after transplantation, many of the grafted cells had
fused to form multinucleated myotubes (Fig. 1 C). Myotubes
were partially aligned along the short (transverse) axis of the
heart. The myotubes stained with antibodies to sarcomeric
MHC, embryonic MHC (Fig. 1 D), and to MHC-fast (not
shown). Occasional cross-striations were noted, but these were
not frequent at this time (Fig. 1 D). The myotubes did not ex￾press cardiac MHC-a. By 1 wk the grafts were easily recogniz￾able as skeletal myofibers and many cells contained cross-stria￾tions. As before, the new myofibers stained with antibodies to
sarcomeric MHC, embryonic MHC, and MHC-fast, but did
not express cardiac MHC-a (not shown). By 2 wk after trans￾plantation the grafts had the appearance of maturing skeletal
myofibers (Fig. 1 E). Sarcomeres were well formed, and many
cells had peripheral nuclei. The myofibers stained intensely
with antibodies to sarcomeric myosin, embryonic MHC (Fig. 1
F), and skeletal MHC-fast (Fig. 1 G). No staining with cardiac
MHC-a antibodies was observed at 2 wk.
At 7 wk after transplantation the grafts were islands of ma￾ture skeletal muscle within young scar tissue (Fig. 1, H–J).
There was a moderate increase in cell diameter compared with
2 wk. None of the muscle grafts were infiltrated or splayed
apart by scar tissue, nor was there evidence of fiber atrophy.
Vascular density appeared normal for muscle tissue (Fig. 1 J).
All of the 7-wk grafts stained strongly with antibodies to sarco￾meric myosin and embryonic MHC (Fig. 1 H). The grafts in￾jected immediately after injury stained intensely with antiskel￾etal MHC-fast, comparable with Fig. 1 F. In contrast, the grafts
injected 1 wk after injury stained poorly with antiskeletal
MHC-fast (see below). No staining with antibodies to cardiac
MHC-a was observed in the grafts, while the adjacent myocar￾dium stained intensely (Fig. 1 I).
At 3 mo after transplantation the grafts again had the ap￾pearance of mature skeletal muscle (Fig. 1 K). Most myofibers
had peripheral nuclei, and vascular density appeared normal.
Fiber diameter was generally larger than in the 7-wk group, in￾dicating that the cells had hypertrophied between 7 wk and 3
mo (compare Fig. 1, J and K). In one heart, however, part of
the graft was infiltrated by scar tissue which encircled individ￾ual myofibers and was associated with fiber atrophy (Fig. 1 L).
The grafts continued to express embryonic MHC and MHC￾fast (not shown). Once again, no staining with antibodies to
cardiac MHC-a was observed (comparable with Fig. 1 I). At
all time points the myofibers were predominantly aligned par￾allel with the short (transverse) axis of the heart and therefore
appeared in longitudinal section. However, some fascicles of
muscle appeared obliquely or cross-sectioned in this plane.
In summary, the grafts began to differentiate into myo￾Table I. Antibodies Used for Immunocytochemistry

tubes between 1 and 3 d and acquired the appearance of ma￾turing myofibers with well formed sarcomeres by 2 wk. The
grafts expressed both embryonic MHC and MHC-fast at all
times between 3 d and 3 mo. There was no expression of car￾diac MHC-a at any time.
Electron microscopy. Electron microscopy was performed
on one heart, 2 wk after myoblast grafting. Most of the grafted
cells had well formed, slightly contracted sarcomeres which
were aligned in registry (Fig. 2 A). Mitochondria were abun￾dant. Multinucleation was evident in many cells, as were well
formed T-tubules. However, in other cells a spectrum of mor￾phological stages was present, consistent with developing skel￾etal muscle (Fig. 2 B). Cells at the earliest stage were small,
had scanty myofibril content, and contained focal aggregations
of electron-dense material suggestive of developing Z-discs. In
these cells there were abundant ribosomes and glycogen, a
prominent Golgi apparatus, and dilated segments of sarcoplas￾mic reticulum. Intermediate cells were larger and had increas￾ing amounts of myofibrils with a corresponding decrease in
ribosomes and glycogen. Some cells had well formed sarco￾meres, but these were out of registry compared with the most
mature cells. No intercalated discs were identified between
cells in the graft region. Adjacent myofibers often had inti￾mately apposed, interdigitating cell membranes. Occasional
cells were identified with electron-dense membrane structures
suggestive of intermediate adherens junctions and gap junc￾tions (Fig. 2, C and D). Some mature myofibers were closely
associated with mesenchymal cells, located within the basal
lamina compartment of the myofiber. Their location within the
basal lamina of the myofiber suggests that they might be new
satellite stem cells (Fig. 2, E and F). Some of these mesenchy￾mal cells had abundant rough endoplasmic reticulum, similar
to fibroblasts. Cells with this morphology have also been de￾scribed in regenerating skeletal muscle by Trupin et al. (15).
Their location within the basal lamina of the myofiber and the
absence of collagen in this space make it unlikely that these
cells are actually fibroblasts.
Myoblast grafts convert from fast to slow twitch fibers.
The poor staining for MHC-fast in the 7-wk group with de￾layed transplantation seemed at variance with the morphology
of the grafts, which showed relatively hypertrophic cells with
well formed sarcomeres. We hypothesized that the grafts had
undergone fiber type conversion to slow twitch muscles, which
no longer expressed high levels of MHC-fast. Slow twitch fi￾bers have physiological similarities to cardiac muscle, includ￾ing a high capacity for oxidative phosphorylation and fatigue
resistance. Furthermore, slow fibers use b-MHC as a major
contractile protein, which is also the predominant myosin in
developing rat hearts. In contrast, fast twitch fibers use glycol￾ysis for ATP production, have a low aerobic capacity and fa￾tigue rapidly, and do not express b-MHC (16). Therefore, we
compared b-MHC expression with skeletal MHC-fast, to de￾termine fiber types in the maturing grafts.
At 1 wk the grafts stained intensely for MHC-fast (Fig. 3 A)
but did not stain with an antibody to b-MHC (Fig. 3 B). At
2 wk the grafts continued to express MHC-fast. In the group
transplanted immediately after injury no expression of b-MHC
was noted at 2 wk, yet in grafts transplanted 1 wk after injury
some cells expressed b-MHC (not shown). At 7 wk after trans￾plantation the two groups differed in expression of MHC-fast,
with strong staining in the immediate transplant group (see
Fig. 1 G) and weak staining in the group where transplantation
was delayed for 1 wk after injury (Fig. 3 C). However, both the
immediate and delayed transplantation groups exhibited ex￾tensive staining for b-MHC at 7 wk after transplantation (Fig.
3 D). At 3 mo there was continued expression of b-MHC and
MHC-fast in the immediate transplantation group; we did not
study the delayed transplantation protocol at 3 mo. Thus, myo￾blast grafts appeared to be undergoing conversion from fast
twitch to slow twitch fibers. Conversion appeared to take place
time. Hematoxylin and eosin stain. 3800. (B) Low magnification of 1-d graft stained for embryonic MHC. The freeze-thaw lesion (Wound) oc￾cupies approximately the upper 75% of the field, while residual subendocardial myocardium (Myo) is present in the lower 25%. None of the 
grafted cells express embryonic MHC, indicating no differentiation had taken place yet. Methyl green counterstain. 380. (C) 3-d graft. Multiple 
multinucleated myotubes (MT) are present. Note that myotubes are already aligned in parallel. The surrounding tissue contains numerous fibro￾blasts (some of which may be of graft origin), macrophages, and capillaries, characteristic of granulation tissue. Two mitotic figures are present 
at the lower right (arrowheads). Hematoxylin and eosin stain. 3800. (D) 3-d graft stained for embryonic MHC. The multinucleated myotubes 
(MT) express embryonic MHC, indicated by brown staining. Note faint cross-striations present at the periphery of some myotubes (arrowheads). 
Comparable staining was seen using antibodies to MHC-fast (not shown). Methyl green counterstain. 3800. (E) 2-wk graft. Multinucleated my￾ofibers are present and many have peripherally placed nuclei (arrows); most of these nuclei appear to be within the sarcolemma, although some 
may be immediately external. Cross-striations were readily seen under the microscope but appear faint in the photograph. Hematoxylin and 
eosin staining. 3800. (F) 2-wk graft stained for embryonic MHC. The myofibers of the graft stain vigorously for embryonic MHC, while the un￾derlying granulation tissue (Wound) and subendocardial myocardium (Myo) do not stain. Methyl green counterstain. 380. (G) 2-wk graft 
stained for fast fiber isoforms of MHC. There is intense staining of the engrafted myofibers (Graft), indicating that they exhibit a fast twitch phe￾notype. Note that the residual myocardium (Myo) beneath the graft does not stain, nor does the granulation tissue of the injured region 
(Wound). 380. (H) 7-wk graft stained for embryonic MHC. The graft continues to stain vigorously for embryonic MHC. There is no staining in 
the underlying young scar tissue (Wound) or the residual subendocardial myocardium (Myo). Methyl green counterstain. 380. (I) 7-wk graft 
stained for cardiac MHC-a. The skeletal myofibers of the graft do not express MHC-a, nor does the underlying scar tissue (Wound). This indi￾cates that the grafted skeletal muscle does not show cardiac differentiation. The subendocardial myocardium (Myo) stains vigorously for
MHC-a. Methyl green counterstain. 380. (J) 7-wk graft. Mature myofibers are present. Most myofibers have peripheral nuclei. Cross-striations 
were readily apparent under the microscope, but again are faint in the photograph. Multiple capillaries are present within the muscle tissue (ar￾rows). Hematoxylin and eosin stain. 3800. (K) 3-mo graft. The myofibers (obliquely and cross-sectioned) have peripheral nuclei and are closely 
apposed with little intervening extracellular matrix. The myofibers are hypertrophic compared with the 7-wk grafts (compare fiber diameter with 
J). Most 3-mo grafts had this appearance. Hematoxylin and eosin stain. 3800. (L) 3-mo graft. The myofibers (cross-sectioned) in this region are 
encased by dense scar tissue and are atrophic. Note the markedly diminished cell diameters compared with K. Such entrapment of myofibers by 
scar was seen in one region of one heart. Hematoxylin and eosin stain. 3800.

in the day 1 group received a single pulse of BrdU 1 h before
time of killing. Double immunostaining was performed with

Figure 3. Fiber type conversion and proliferation of engrafted skeletal myoblasts. For the fiber typing experiments, rat hearts were injured by 
freeze-thaw and the lesions were allowed to heal for 1 wk. Syngeneic skeletal myoblasts were engrafted into the 1-wk-old wounds. For studies of 
cell proliferation, myoblasts were engrafted immediately after cardiac injury. Rats were killed at the indicated times after transplantation. Anti￾bodies specific to fast twitch (MHC-fast) and slow twitch (b-MHC) fibers were used to define fiber types. Processing for frozen sections in A–D
resulted in formation of contraction bands, artifactual clumping of the sarcomeres due to hypercontracture. BrdU was administered 24 h before 
time of killing to detect DNA synthesis. Double immunostaining for BrdU and MHC was then performed on paraffin sections. Appearance of a 
BrdU-positive nucleus within a myosin-positive cell indicated the myoblast had replicated and fused into the myotube within the last 24 h. (A)

myoblasts which had proliferated and subsequently differenti￾ated. In the day 1 grafts, proliferating cells were present within
the necrotic lesion, which could have represented either graft
cells or macrophages. As mentioned above, none of the cells
expressed MHC at this time, so it was not possible to deter￾mine which among these were myoblasts (versus transplanted
fibroblasts or host macrophages). In the day 3 grafts, occa￾sional BrdU-positive nuclei were identified within myosin-pos￾Figure 4. Contractile function

Wound strips from injured 
hearts receiving either skeletal 
myoblasts or a sham saline in￾jection were excised at 2 wk. 
Wounds were mounted on an

oxygenated buffer and electri￾cally stimulated. The carats in￾dicate the onset of electrical 
stimulation. Force has been 
normalized to cross-sectional 
area. (A) The first panel shows 
individual muscle twitch in a

the rapid contraction and relax￾ation rates. The second panel 
shows that individual twitches 
began to superimpose with a 
stimulation frequency of 4 Hz, 
with a resulting potentiation in 
developed tension. The third 
panel shows that tetanus was in￾duced with stimuli $ 7 Hz. Note 
the further increase in tension 
compared with the 4-Hz stimu￾lation. Time to peak force in 
this preparation was z 1 s, 
faster than was typically ob￾served for the overall group. 
The fourth panel shows that no 
tension was developed at any 
voltage in a sham-injected 
wound. This tracing is represen￾tative of six wound strips from 
three sham-injected hearts. (B) 
Force–voltage relationship. De￾veloped tension for individual 
twitches increased as stimuli in￾creased from 30 to 100 V, indi￾cating recruitment of addi￾tional myofibers. Data have

developed tension and are pre￾sented as mean6SEM of eight 
wound strips from six hearts.

subjected to a cardiac-like duty 
cycle, consisting of repeated ep￾isodes of 0.33 s of tetanus/0.67 s 
of rest, to mimic a heart rate of 
60 beats/min. There was a 53% 
decrease in developed tension 
at the end of the 6-min test. 
Note that most of the diminu￾tion in force occurred during 
the first 3 min. Data represent 
mean6SEM of seven wound

itive cells (Fig. 3 E). We observed a total of 12 such nuclei in
three hearts. No attempt was made to quantify this low rate,
but it was certainly , 1% of total nuclei in myosin-positive
cells. Virtually no BrdU-positive nuclei were seen in myosin￾positive cells at 1, 2, or 7 wk after transplantation (not shown).
We conclude that myoblast proliferation occurs for at least 3 d
after grafting, but by 1 wk virtually all cells have ceased repli￾cating.
Contractile function of myoblast grafts. The contractile prop￾erties of 2-wk-old myoblast grafts were determined by attach￾ing isolated wound strips to a tension myograph ex vivo. Virtu￾ally no spontaneous mechanical activity was detected, consistent
with the paucity of cardiomyocytes histologically. Electrical
stimulation caused muscle twitches in six of eight myoblast￾engrafted hearts (Fig. 4 A, first panel); strips from the remain￾ing two hearts may have been damaged during sample prepa￾ration, since skeletal muscle was present histologically. The
grafts showed a stepwise increase in tension development as
voltage was increased from 30 to z 100 V with a plateau there￾after (Fig. 4 B). This indicates that increasing voltage recruited
additional myofibers to contract, implying that the graft myofi￾bers are electrically insulated from one another. It should be
noted that cardiac muscle does not increase contractile force
with increasing voltage, since cardiocytes are coupled electri￾cally via gap junctions.
Next, force–frequency relationships were determined. Us￾ing 120% of the voltage required for maximal tension develop￾ment, the frequency of stimulation was increased incremen￾tally from 0.5 to 10 Hz. Twitches began to superimpose at
frequencies of 3–4 Hz, with a resulting increase in total devel￾oped tension (Fig. 4 A, second panel). Fully fused tetani were
produced with 6–7 Hz stimulation (Fig. 4 A, third panel). Peak
force during tetanus was 1.9860.45 grams (mean SEM); after
normalization to cross-sectional area the peak force was
0.7260.14 grams/mm2
. The time to peak tetanic force averaged
2.360.3 s, although 90% of peak force was typically generated
within 1.5 s. The time to half-relaxation after tetanus was
240617 ms. It should be stressed that tetanus cannot be in￾duced in cardiac muscle, due to the long refractory period of
cardiocytes.
Finally, a fatigue test was performed to test the response of
this muscle to a cardiac-like work load. The grafts were sub￾jected to a duty cycle consisting of repeated 0.33 s of tetanic
stimuli followed by 0.67 s of rest, mimicking a heart rate of 60
beats/min. The grafts showed a 32% decline in developed ten￾sion by 2 min and a 53% decline by the end of the 6-min test
period (Fig. 4 C). No contractile activity could be elicited from
six of seven wound strips from three injured hearts which re￾ceived a sham injection of saline instead of myoblasts (Fig. 4 A,
fourth panel). In one sham heart an adhesion had developed
between the heart and chest wall, resulting in a small amount
of intercostal muscle adhering to one of the two wound strips.
In this preparation we detected a peak force of 0.04 grams/
mm2
, , 2% of what was present in the myoblast-engrafted
hearts.
Thus, the skeletal muscle grafts could be stimulated to con￾tract ex vivo and could sustain a cardiac-like duty cycle over a
6-min test period. Furthermore, the grafts showed two physio￾logical properties unique to skeletal muscle: recruitment of fi￾bers with increasing voltage and the ability to sustain tetanic
contraction. We do not know yet whether the grafts contract in
vivo.
Discussion
The principal findings of this study are: (a) neonatal skeletal
myoblasts can be grafted into an injured heart; (b) the en￾grafted myoblasts initially proliferate and then begin to form
multinucleated myotubes by day 3; (c) the myotubes differen￾tiate into mature myofibers, which initially have a phenotype
similar to fast twitch muscle; (d) the myofibers develop charac￾teristics of slow twitch muscle as the wound heals; (e) the new
muscle may form satellite stem cells; and (f) the new muscle
can be stimulated to contract ex vivo.
Strategies for muscle regeneration after myocardial injury.
In principal, there are at least three strategies to induce muscle
regeneration after myocardial infarction. First, the surround￾ing cardiac myocytes could be stimulated to migrate into the
wound and proliferate to repair the defect. There is evidence
that a limited amount of cell replication by adult cardiocytes
occurs naturally after myocardial infarction in humans (17)
and in rats (18, 19), but the response is clearly not adequate to
repair the defect. The factors responsible for cell cycle arrest in
cardiocytes are not well enough defined at present to begin ex￾ploring this as a therapy. (The interested reader is referred to
references 20–23 for further information on this topic.)
A second strategy is to induce the cells of cardiac granula￾tion tissue (the fibroblast-rich tissue of wound repair) to differ￾entiate into muscle rather than forming a scar. There is not
enough known about cardiac differentiation at present to at￾tempt formation of new myocardium. However, much more is
known about skeletal muscle determination. The discovery of
myogenic determination genes (24, 25) has made it possible to
induce a wide range of cultured cell types to differentiate into
skeletal muscle. Recent studies from our group (26) and others
(27) have shown that cells in cardiac granulation tissue can be
induced to differentiate into skeletal muscle by transfection
with the prototype myogenic determination gene, MyoD. In
these early experiments, however, the frequency of muscle dif￾ferentiation has been low after MyoD gene transfer. Until the
frequency of myogenic conversion can be increased, it will be
difficult to investigate the functional properties of the MyoD￾induced skeletal muscle.
The third strategy for muscular repair of infarcts is to trans￾plant either skeletal or cardiac myoblasts into the injured re￾gion. Studies by Koh et al. (3) and Soonpaa et al. (2) have
demonstrated that fetal cardiocytes will form intercalated discs
with host cardiocytes, including gap junctions and adherens
junctions, when transplanted into normal hearts. No prolifera￾tion was detected in the grafted cardiocytes. Less information
is available on grafting of cardiocytes into injured hearts. Our
group (28) and others (29, 30) have preliminary data showing
that neonatal rat or fetal human cardiocytes can be trans￾planted successfully into injured rat hearts. To our knowledge
there is no information regarding proliferation of these grafts,
nor are any functional data available. As discussed above, the
principal limitation to this approach is the inability to induce
cardiocytes to proliferate in culture. Until cardiocytes can rep￾licate in vitro, or proliferation-competent cells can be induced
reliably to differentiate into cardiocytes, cardiocyte grafting
will not be feasible in humans.
In contrast to cardiocytes, proliferating skeletal muscle pre￾cursors are readily available, either as primary myoblasts in
developing muscle or as satellite cells from quiescent muscle.
In this study six rat pups yielded the myoblasts implanted into

Skeletal Myoblasts for Cardiac Repair 2521
27 injured hearts. In addition to their growth in culture, the
myoblasts proliferated in vivo for several days after transplan￾tation (Fig. 3 E). These properties have led us and several
other groups to explore skeletal muscle grafting for cardiac re￾pair. Koh et al. (7) demonstrated that the myogenic cell line
C2C12 could be transplanted into the hearts of normal synge￾neic mice, where the cells fused to form multinucleated myofi￾bers. The same group also demonstrated that C2C12 cells sta￾bly transfected with a plasmid encoding active TGF-b could
induce angiogenesis around the graft site (31). No coupling be￾tween the host cardiocytes and the grafted skeletal muscle was
observed in either experiment.
Chiu et al. (8, 9) transplanted autologous satellite cells into
cardiac freeze-thaw lesions in dogs. Comparable with our
study, they also found that the grafts formed muscle cells
within the healing lesion. In distinction to the current study,
however, they hypothesized that their grafted skeletal muscle
cells differentiated into cardiac muscle, via “milieu-dependent
effects.” The evidence for a cardiac phenotype was that some
cells within the grafts had central rather than peripheral nuclei,
and some cells contained refractile transverse structures under
light microscopy interpreted to be intercalated discs. Although
we observed some myofibers with persistent central nuclei in
this study, as well as rare cells showing intermediate and gap
junctions (Fig. 2, C and D), no intercalated discs were present
by electron microscopy. More importantly, the grafted cells ex￾pressed skeletal muscle–specific proteins and failed to express
the cardiac-specific isoform MHC-a up to 3 mo after trans￾plantation. Thus, there clearly was no cardiac differentiation in
this study.
Conversion of grafts from fast to slow twitch muscle. Al￾though the skeletal muscle grafts expressed the fast fiber iso￾form of MHC at 1 and 2 wk, they expressed b-MHC, a marker
for slow twitch fibers, at 7 wk and 3 mo. This indicates that the
grafts were converting to slow twitch fibers. Conversion was
apparently more rapid when the myoblasts were injected into
wounds where healing had been allowed to progress for 1 wk,
as opposed to immediately after injury. In the delayed trans￾plantation model the grafts expressed b-MHC at 2 wk, while in
the immediate transplantation model this protein was not de￾tected until 7 wk. It is possible that the growth factors and cy￾tokines present in the early wound delay myoblast differentia￾tion and subsequent fiber type conversion.
Slow fibers exhibit several important differences from fast
fibers, including a slower shortening velocity, use of oxidative
phosphorylation for ATP production, a higher mitochondrial
content, a higher myoglobin content, and a much greater resis￾tance to fatigue (16, 32). An interesting parallel is that the
latissimus dorsi muscle also undergoes fiber type switching
when it is conditioned for dynamic cardiomyoplasty. Cardio￾myoplasty is an experimental therapy for heart failure, where
skeletal muscle is wrapped around the heart to serve as a ven￾tricular assist device (33). Untrained latissimus dorsi is a mixed
fiber type muscle which fatigues rapidly with repeated stimula￾tion. When conditioned by repeated electrical stimulation for 6
wk before surgery, however, the latissimus dorsi converts en￾tirely to slow twitch fibers and becomes fatigue resistant (6).
Only the conditioned, slow twitch muscle is able to assist car￾diac function. This parallel suggests the intriguing possibility
that repeated electromechanical stimulation leads to activation
of the slow fiber phenotype. Since we did not test whether the
environment of the heart contributed to fiber type conversion,
additional experiments will be required to determine the
mechanism. The fact that the grafts differentiated into slow
twitch fibers suggests that they may be suited to perform a car￾diac type work load.
Will skeletal muscle transplantation augment cardiac func￾tion? This study definitively showed that myoblast grafting
can generate new contractile tissue. The skeletal muscle grafts
exhibited characteristic twitches when stimulated ex vivo (Fig.
4 A) and showed recruitment of contractile units with increas￾ing voltage (Fig. 4 B). Furthermore, tetanus could be induced
with rapid stimulation (Fig. 4 A, second and third panels), and
the grafts could perform a cardiac-like duty cycle for 6 min
(Fig. 4 C). Peak force during tetanus averaged 0.760.1 grams/
mm2
. Since the wound strips contained , 50% of the myofiber
content of normal muscle, due to inclusion of scar tissue, the
force can be normalized to at least 1.4 grams/mm2
 muscle.
Adult mammalian muscle can generate 15–35 grams/mm2
force at tetanus, depending on fiber type (14, 34). Thus, the 2-wk
grafts generated z 4–10% of the predicted force for mature
skeletal muscle. Several factors may cause a lower than pre￾dicted force, including the relative immaturity of the 2-wk my￾ofibers, stretching of the immature extracellular matrix, poor
cell matrix attachments, or misalignment of some fibers rela￾tive to the axis of the wound strip.
Although preliminary, these results are encouraging and
suggest that more detailed studies of contractile function are
warranted in skeletal myoblast-engrafted hearts. A critical
question is whether the skeletal muscle grafts contract in vivo.
To provide coordinated mechanical assistance, the grafted
cells ideally should form electrical and mechanical junctions
with the host myocardium. In our grafts the skeletal muscle
cells were insulated from the remaining myocardium by scar
tissue, so there was no opportunity for myofiber–cardiocyte
coupling to occur. Koh et al. (7) transplanted C2C12 myoblasts
into normal mouse hearts and observed no cell junctions be￾tween grafted myofibers and host cardiocytes by electron mi￾croscopy. Although proliferating myoblasts have been reported
to synthesize both gap junction proteins (35) and N-cadherin
(36, 37), these proteins are typically absent from adult skeletal
myofibers. By electron microscopy we observed evidence both
for intermediate and gap junction formation between skeletal
myofibers 2 wk after grafting (Fig. 2, C and D). This finding
was infrequent, however, and it is unknown whether such junc￾tions would persist in longer term grafts. If skeletal muscle will
not couple spontaneously with cardiac muscle, it is possible
that such junctions could be induced by stably transfecting
skeletal muscle cells with genes for cardiac junctional proteins.
Another possibility is that skeletal muscle grafts could be elec￾trically paced in synchrony with the cardiac cycle. Pacing
would require sufficient voltage to activate all of the fibers,
and currently it is unknown whether this would have a delete￾rious effect on the surrounding myocardium.
In the uninjured heart there is a complex fiber geometry,
where the outer fibers run in the long axis, the midwall fibers
run in the short axis, and the inner fibers again run in the long
axis. This geometry is established during embryogenesis and is
thought to be important for mechanical efficiency. In this
study, the grafted myofibers were predominantly aligned with
the short (transverse) axis of the heart. Alignment was noted
as early as day 3, when myotube formation was prominent
(Fig. 1 C). This is the same orientation that wound fibroblasts
and collagen fibers acquire during wound healing, and it seems

2522 Murry et al.
likely that all are aligned by local mechanical forces. It is not
known whether alignment with the heart’s short axis will influ￾ence the ability of these myofibers to restore mechanical func￾tion after injury.
There are two aspects of skeletal muscle which theoreti￾cally could make it superior to cardiac muscle for infarct re￾pair. First, skeletal muscle is much more resistant to ischemia
than cardiac muscle. Skeletal muscle can withstand many
hours of severe ischemia without becoming irreversibly in￾jured, whereas in myocardium irreversible injury begins within
20 min (38). A second difference is that skeletal myoblast
grafts might establish satellite cells. Satellite cells are the resi￾dent stem cells in skeletal muscle and proliferate in response to
injury. Once activated, satellite cells can fuse with damaged
myofibers or establish new myofibers to replace those lost to
necrosis. We observed cells within 2-wk grafts which were
morphologically consistent with satellite cells by electron mi￾croscopy (Fig. 3, E and F). Thus, it is possible that infarcts re￾paired with skeletal myoblasts might become more resistant to
a subsequent episode of ischemia or might be able to replace
myofibers damaged by ischemia.
