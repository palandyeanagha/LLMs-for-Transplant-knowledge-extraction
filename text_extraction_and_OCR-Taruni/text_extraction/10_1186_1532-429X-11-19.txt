Abstract
Background: Quantification of ventricular volume by Steady State Free Precession (SSFP)
cardiovascular magnetic resonance is accurate and reproducible. Normal values exist for adults, but
are lacking for children.
We sought to establish normal values for left and right ventricular volumes, mass and function in
healthy children by using SSFP.
Methods and results: Fifty children (27 females, 23 males) without cardiovascular disease were
evaluated. Median age was 11 years (range 7 months – 18 years), weight 35 kg (range 7–77 kg),
height 146 cm (range 66–181 cm). Thirty-six examinations were performed with breath holding,
14 in freely breathing sedated children.
Ventricular volumes and mass were measured in the end systolic and end diastolic phase on SSFP
cine images acquired in a short axis plane as a stack of 12 contiguous slices covering full length of
both ventricles.
Regression analysis showed an exponential relationship between body surface area (BSA) and
ventricular volumes and mass (normal value = a*BSAb). Normative curves for males and females are
presented in relation to BSA for the enddiastolic volume, endsystolic volume and mass of both
ventricles. Intra- and interobserver variability of the measurements was within the limits of 2% and
7% respectively, except for right ventricular mass (10%).
Conclusion: The exponential equation for calculation of normal values for each ventricular
parameter and graphical display of normative curves for data acquired in healthy children by SSFP
cardiovascular magnetic resonance are provided.

Background
Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is nowadays
considered an essential tool for advanced assessment of
congenital heart disease (CHD). Besides anatomical infor￾mation, CMR can provide reliable quantification of vari￾ous functional cardiac parameters. CMR measurements of
ventricular volumes, mass and function have been vali￾dated in vitro and in vivo, demonstrating excellent accu￾racy and reproducibility of the method [1,2]. Thus CMR is
considered superior to any other technique and often
cited as the "gold-standard" [3]; its results are getting
increasingly used for clinical decision making [4]. This is
especially true for the right ventricle (RV) and an abnor￾mally shaped left ventricle (LV), which are of particular
interest in CHD, as the measurement used in CMR is not
based on geometrical assumptions, but reproduces the
real shape of a certain volume (disc summation method)
[5].
The Steady State Free Precession (SSFP) cine sequence is
the technique used in most centres for single-slice multi￾phase acquisitions [6,7]. The superior discrimination
between blood and endocardium by using SSFP results in
different volume measurements compared to gradient
echo cine images; therefore different normal volumetric
values are required [8].
Normal values for the left and the right ventricle in the
adult population have been published [9,10], but normal
data for children are scarce, and have mainly been
acquired with the previously used gradient echo cine
sequence in only a small number of subjects [11,12]. In
paediatric patients, CMR data regarding the ventricular
volumes are increasingly used for critical clinical decision
making, such as indication for uni- or biventricular repair
in complex CHD or for deciding on reinterventions dur￾ing follow up of repaired CHD. Therefore, establishment
of volumetric normative data for children with the cur￾rently used CMR technique is urgently needed.
The aim of our study was to establish normal values for
left and right ventricular volumes, mass and function in
healthy children by using CMR with SSFP sequences.
Methods
Subjects
Fifty-two subjects were recruited for the study among
physically normally developed children without cardio￾vascular disease, undergoing magnetic resonance imaging
for evaluation of peripheral and local anomalies, typically
orthopaedic disease. Inclusion criteria were age between 0
and 18 months and no evidence of cardiovascular disease.
Exclusion criteria consisted of presence of disease affect￾ing the chest or the cardiovascular system, acute infec￾tions, arterial hypertension, arrhythmias, anaemia,
neoplasm, and use of any drug. An abnormal body size for
the age, defined as bodyweight or length below the 3rd or
above the 97th percentile of the normative values for the
Swiss population, represented an additional exclusion cri￾terion [13]. Two children were excluded for abnormal
body size according to this criterion.
Written informed consent for participation in the study
was obtained from the parents in all cases and from the
child whenever possible. The patients demographic data
as well as bodyweight and height where collected at the
same day of the examination.
The ethics board of our institution approved the study
protocol.
Technique
The magnetic resonance examination was performed on a
1.5 Tesla scanner (Signa HDx, GE Medical Systems, Mil￾waukee, WI, USA). CMR was performed after completion
of the clinical MR examination by using an 8-channel
phased-array cardiac coil for larger children and a quadra￾ture head coil for smaller children. Cine imaging was per￾formed with a two dimensional retrospectively cardiac
gated SSFP sequence (2D FIESTA) using following param￾eters: TR 3.5–4.2 ms, TE 1.5–1.8 ms, flip-angle 45°, band￾width ± 125 kHz, matrix 224 × 224, number of excitations
1 (breath hold) or 2 (free breathing), field of view 250–
350 mm, field of view in phase direction 75%, slice thick￾ness 5–8 mm with a gap of 0–2 mm depending on body
size and targeting 12 slices to be acquired. If Gadolinium
based contrast medium had been previously given for the
clinical study, the flip angle was raised to 60° in order to
optimise the contrast between blood and myocardium.
The degree of k-space segmentation (views per segment 4–
12) and number of images reconstructed per cardiac cycle
(20 – 30) was adjusted to the heart rate in order to achieve
a true temporal (calculated as TR × views per segment) res￾olution in the range of 21–45 ms, for accurate definition
of the end-systolic and end-diastolic phase[14,15]. Thus
mean temporal resolution obtained was 34 ± 7 ms.
After obtaining sagittal, coronal and axial localizers, SSFP
cine images were acquired first in the vertical and horizon￾tal long axis planes for planning the subsequent stack of
at least 12 contiguous slices in the short axis plane cover￾ing both ventricles in their entire length. The short axis
images were obtained from the base to the apex of the
heart, with the most basal slice positioned parallel to and
across the plane of the atrioventricular valves [10,16].
Non-sedated children were instructed on how to hold
their breath prior to the examination, and the images were
acquired during end-expiratory breath holds. In children

examined under sedation the images were acquired dur￾ing free breathing.
Image analysis
All images were analysed on a commercially available off￾line workstation (SUN Microsystems Inc., Mountainview,
CA, USA). Measurement of ventricular volumes and myo￾cardial mass was performed using the MASS+ Software
package (Magnetic Resonance Analytical Software System,
Version 4.0, MEDIS, Medical Imaging Systems, Leiden,
The Netherlands).
The end-systolic and the end-diastolic phase were first
identified visually on a movie loop of a midventricular
slice. The endocardial contours were then traced manually
on the images of the estimated end-systolic and end￾diastolic phase, as well as on the two previous and follow￾ing phases, for a correct detection of the minimal (end￾systolic) and maximal (end-diastolic) volume. Stroke vol￾ume was calculated as the difference between the end￾diastolic volume (EDV) and the end-systolic volume
(ESV) and ejection fraction (EF) was defined as EDV-ESV/
EDV.
The epicardial contours were traced in the end-systolic
and in the end-diastolic phase for calculation of the ven￾tricular mass. The myocardial volume was calculated as
the difference of the epicardial and the endocardial vol￾umes and multiplied by the specific density of the myo￾cardium (1.05 g/ml) for obtaining the value of
myocardial mass[17]. For calculation of global ventricular
volumes, mass and function the papillary muscles were
included in the ventricular cavity (figure 1). Similarly, the
myocardial trabeculations of the right ventricle [18] and
the moderator band were included in the RV cavity.
Finally, the mass of the papillary muscles of the LV was
analysed separately and presented in a different normo￾gram (figure 3).
For correct identification of the most basal slice, i.e. if the
slice was located in the atrium or in the ventricle, cavities
surrounded by at least 50% of their circumference by
myocardium were considered as ventricular [19]. In addi￾tion the observation of the changes in volume (dilatation
or contraction) during systole or diastole of a cardiac
structure helped to identify the structure as atrium or ven￾tricle. Ventricular volume was calculated by summation of
the traced ventricular cavity areas, multiplied by the sum
of slice and gap thickness.
Sedation Procedure
Anaesthesia was induced either intravenously with propo￾fol 2 mg/kg and further doses of 1 mg/kg as necessary to
tolerate positioning, or by inhalation with sevoflurane 4–
8% in oxygen/nitrous oxide (1:1) until an intravenous
line was established (Aestiva 5/MRI, Datex-Ohmeda, Hel￾sinki, Finland). Meticulous care was taken to maintain
spontaneous breathing. 2 L/min Oxygen was applied with
a nasal cannula with separate O2 tube and CO2 sampling
tube (Salter Labs, Arvin, California). Deep sedation was
continued with propofol 10 mg/kg/h given as continuous
intravenous infusion, following our institutional proto￾col. Routine monitoring of capnography with respiratory
rate and end-tidal carbon dioxide concentration, oxygen
saturation, heart rate, electrocardiogram and blood pres￾sure, was assessed continuously (Datex-Ohmeda MRI
Monitor, Datex-Ohmeda, Helsinki, Finland).
Statistical analysis
Demographic data are expressed as median and range.
Body surface area was calculated from the Mosteller for￾mula[20].
Several regression models were used to examine the allo￾metric relationship between ventricular parameters and
BSA. We tested the following equations: Y = ax+c, Y = axb,
Y = ax2+bx+c and Y = ax3+bx2+dx+c, where Y is the pre￾dicted value and x is BSA. For exponential functions, a log￾arithmic transformation of the measurements was
performed before fitting of the regression models for the
purpose of stabilize variances. The best fitting model was
defined by a large R2, i.e by a high percentage of the vari￾ability of the data that is explained by the association
between variables, and analysis of residuals for each
regression equation. The resulting equations and parame￾ters were then retransformed to a linear scale. Significance
of gender, previous administration of contrast-medium,
and acquisition of the images during free-breathing or
breath holding were tested by introducing a factor
accounting for each of these variances in the regression
model. A p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Intra- and interobserver variability were evaluated in two
observers blinded to each other by using Bland-Altman
analysis in 10 randomly selected patients[21] Statistical
analysis was performed using commercially available soft￾ware packages (Prism 4.03, GraphPad Software Inc. San
Diego USA and SPSS for Windows, Rel. 14.0.1. 2005. Chi￾cago: SPSS Inc.).
Results
Demographics
50 normotensive children (23 male, 27 female) were
included in the study. Demographic data are shown in
table 1. No significant difference was found for body size
between males and females.
In 36 children image acquisition was performed during
breath holding; 13 were examined in deep sedation and
images acquired during free breathing; one child was una￾ble to hold his breath and images were acquired in free
breathing as well.
Volumetric parameters
The regression model y = axb best described the relation￾ship between ventricular parameters and BSA. Thus the
final normative equation for all ventricular parameters
was: normal value = a*BSAb.
All values for each ventricular parameter are described in
table 2. Despite the similar body size and BSA between
both genders, significantly larger systolic and diastolic
ventricular volumes were found in males; in contrast, no
gender difference was observed for cardiac output and
ejection fraction (table 2). In contrast, previous adminis￾tration of gadolinium and image acquisition during
breath holding or during free breathing did not show any
statistical significance; therefore the corresponding factors
could be eliminated from the regression model and do
not figure in the final equation. Measurements of myocar￾dial mass in endsystolic and endiastolic phase did not dif￾fer significantly, and only data from enddiastolic phase
are shown. On the base of normal data, z-values can be
calculated for each performed measurement by using the
standard deviation (SD) given in table 2 and following
equation adapted for the logarithmic transformation
(described in the methods section):
Figure 2 and 3 shows the gender specific normative curves
for the ventricular volumes and mass of the left ventricle,
and figure 4 for the right ventricle. The EF of the left ven￾tricle was constant for all BSA, with a mean EF of 61.3%
(SD 4.1%). In contrast, a slightly negative correlation was
found between BSA and the right ventricular EF, fitting
following regression equation EF = 61.8 - 3.6 * BSA (SD
4.2).
Reproducibility
Intra- and interobserver variability is summarized in Table
3. Variability was slightly smaller for measurements of the
left ventricle with a variability range from 1% to 3% for
intraobserver measurements, and from 2% to 7% for
interobserver measurements. Variability for measure￾ments of the right ventricle ranged from 2.6% to 9% for
intraobserver assessment, and from 4% to 10% for inter￾observer assessment.
Discussion
This study provides normal values for the left and right
ventricular volumes, myocardial mass, and ejection frac￾tion in children and adolescents measured by using the
SSFP sequence. These data are an update to previously
published normative values which were collected only in
small paediatric sample sizes and had been acquired with
the gradient-echo cine sequence, which is not being com￾monly used any more [11,16]. Maceira et al have pub￾lished recently normal values acquired with the SSFP
technique for the adult population [9,10]. Their data were
acquired in subjects older than 20 years of age and
showed that in adults most ventricular parameters are sig￾nificantly and independently influenced by gender, age
and BSA [9,10]. We present paediatric reference values,
covering an age spectrum from 1 to 18 years and taking
into account the correct allometric relationship between
cardiac dimensions and body size in the growing body
[22]. Notably, in growing individuals the correlation
between age and BSA is more pronounced than in adults.
Our data can be compared with those of a very recent pub￾lication. Robbers-Visser et colleagues established volu￾z value measurement ect - = log ( / exp ) / ed normal value SD. 10

metric normative data in a similar number of healthy
children [23]. They used the same acquisition technique
and similar analysis algorithm for the images, but a differ￾ent statistical method by correlating the data to BSA with
a univariate linear regression analysis. Even by consider￾ing this methodical difference, the results of both studies
fit together precisely, with an insignificant difference of 2
ml/m2 for the left ventricular EDV and of 4 ml/m2 for the
right ventricular EDV. Additionally, following characteris￾tics of the data has been found by both groups: gender
modifies the relationship between volumetric data and
BSA, so that gender needs to be added as separate variable
in regression models; ejection fraction remains constant
throughout growth and does not differ significantly
between boys and girls; a good R2 points out a strong rela￾tionship between BSA and ventricular volumes; SSFP
images yield to larger volume measurements than gradi￾ent echo cine images, as previously demonstrated [8,24].
If we compare our results with those obtained previously
with the gradient echo cine technique by the same group
[11], we found slightly larger end-diastolic and end-systo￾lic volumes for both ventricles (LVEDV +9 ml/m2, RVEDV
+14 ml/m2), resulting in a difference in stroke volumes
less than 1 ml.
Finding the correct allometric relationship is crucial for
exact description of growth of the human heart in relation
to BSA [22]. We used an exponential equation with expo￾nents for BSA ranging from 1.3 (LV mass) to 1.56
(RVESV), which is in agreement with the existing litera￾ture. Sluysmans et al advocated, after extensive model
analysis, the use of a two-parameter regression model (Y
= axb) with an exponent for BSA of 1.385 for calculation
of LVEDV, measured by 2D echocardiography [22]. Lange
et al in an angiographic study found exponents for BSA
ranging from 1.17 (RVEDV) to 1.34 (LVESV)[25]. Finally
Gutgesell et al in a meta-analysis of published echocardi￾ographic and angiographic data described the appropriate
regression equation Y = 70*5BSA1.4 (1.3–1.5) for determina￾tion of LVEDV[26]. The high R2 (≥ 0.95 for volumetric
data) obtained in our study by using an exponential equa￾tion for BSA and introducing an additional factor for gen￾der, demonstrate that the fitting model is appropriate and
more accurate than others used in different studies [23].
On the base of all these data demonstrating that cardiac
volumes have a non-linear relation to body surface area,
and since the exponential values are different for different
cardiac parameters, it would not be appropriate to provide
normal values simply indexed to BSA in a table [26].
Therefore, we decided to provide the appropriate regres￾sion formula for every normal value that needs to be cal￾culated. For practical and clinical use, we provide an
additional graphical display of the normal curve for each
parameter and gender in relation to BSA, which is the rec￾ommended and commonly used parameter for body size
in paediatrics.
The correct definition of the endocardial contours has a
major impact on the accuracy of volumetric measure￾ments. It has been shown that delineation along the bor￾der of the compact myocardium has better reproducibility
than delineation along the fine endocardial trabecula￾tions [18]. Sievers et al found small systematic but signif￾icant differences on volumetric measurements, if the
papillary muscles were delineated separately, which they
judged to be of no clinical relevance [27]. We excluded the
papillary muscles from the ventricular mass for the overall
measurements, and provide separate data for the papillary
muscles allowing calculation of full myocardial mass.
The intra- and inter-observer variability in our study are
within the variability range previously described in the lit￾erature confirming the good reproducibility of the CMR
volumetric measurements [11,23,28]. Similarly to others,
we found slightly larger variability for measurements of
the right ventricle, likely due to the difficult definition of
the plane of the atrioventricular valve, the fine course
trabeculations and partial volume effects inherent of the
right ventricle [11,18]. For the same reasons, the highest
variability was found for measurements of the right ven￾tricular mass. In addition, being the right ventricular myo￾cardium very thin, its proper delineation may be
challenging in children. Therefore, quantification of right
ventricular mass in children should be performed with
caution and investigators need to be aware of its limited
reproducibility.
Limitations
Small children recruited for the study (n = 14) were exam￾ined under sedation with propofol and the images were

acquired while freely breathing. Due to respiratory
motion, the image quality was not as good as when
acquired during breath holding. Nevertheless, the cardiac
borders were perceived well enough for allowing tracing
of the contours in all children. The image quality and
accuracy of volume measurements can be improved in
small children by performing the CMR exam under gen￾eral anaesthesia with controlled ventilation allowing
image acquisition in breath hold. Due to obvious ethical
reasons, we could not intubate any young child solely for
investigational purposes. When performing studies in
sedation or general anaesthesia, investigators need to be
aware that anaesthetic drugs may have some minor influ￾ence on cardiac function
In our study group we could not find any statistical signif￾icant difference between the regression curves of subjects
studied during free breathing (sedation) and those who
were able to held their breath; therefore the two groups
are presented in the same normative curve.
More detailed analysis of the effects of gender, BSA,
weight, height, and conditions of image acquisition, such
as breath hold or free breathing, sedation or mechanical
ventilation, on the ventricular volumetric values, requires
a larger number of subjects studied. In the field of paedi￾atric cardiology, these results may be achieved by plan￾ning a large multi-centre study.
Conclusion
This study provides the normal values for left- and right
ventricular volumes, mass and function in children, deter￾mined by SSFP CMR. As the relationship between cardiac
volumetric data and BSA is not linear, the data are dis￾played graphically in form of normative curves and the
appropriate equations for calculation of the expected
value are provided for each gender and parameter. These
data are of significant clinical and research utility for cen￾tres assessing children with congenital or acquired heart
disease by CMR.
