Abstract
TTN gene truncating variants are common in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), although data
on their clinical significance is still limited. We sought to examine the frequency of truncating
variants in TTN in patients with DCM, including familial DCM (FDCM), and to look for geno￾type-phenotype correlations. Clinical cardiovascular data, family histories and blood sam￾ples were collected from 72 DCM probands, mean age of 34 years, 45.8% FDCM. DNA
samples were examined by next generation sequencing (NGS) with a focus on the TTN
gene. Truncating mutations were followed up by segregation study among family members.
We identified 16 TTN truncating variants (TTN trunc) in 17 probands (23.6% of all cases,
30.3% of FDCM, 17.9% of sporadic DCM). During mean 63 months from diagnosis, there
was no difference in adverse cardiac events between probands with and without TTN trun￾cating mutations. Among relatives 29 mutation carriers were identified, nine were definitely
affected (31%), eight probably affected (27.6%) one possibly affected (3.4%) and eleven
were not affected (37.9%). When relatives with all affected statuses were combined, dis￾ease penetrance was still incomplete (62.1%) even after exclusion of unaffected relatives
under 40 (82%) and was higher in males versus females. In all mutation carriers, during fol￾low-up, 17.4% had major adverse cardiac events, and prognosis was significantly worse in
men than in women. In conclusion, TTN truncating variants were observed in nearly one
fourth of young DCM patient population, in vast majority without conduction system disease.

Introduction
Whereas mutations in numerous loci have been known to predispose to dilated cardiomyopa￾thy (DCM) [1], recently titin gene (TTN) emerged as a major DCM locus with truncating
mutations found in one fifth to one fourth of patients, especially those with familial forms of
the disease [2–4]. However, some doubt about pathogenicity of TTN truncating variants was
raised by their presence in 1% of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) patients and in 3% of
controls [2], and by their co-occurrence with additional known disease-causing variants in the
patients [5]. Recently, an exhaustive analysis of TTN truncated transcripts expression in the
heart muscle was published showing that unlike in controls, TTN truncating mutations in
DCM patients were predominantly located in the sarcomeric A-band region of the protein,
occurred closer to the protein’s carboxyl terminus and were present in exons that were abun￾dantly transcribed in the heart muscle [6].
Our aims were: (1) to identify genetic background in a cohort of DCM patients referred for
clinical genetic diagnosis with a focus on TTN truncating mutations, and (2): to examine geno￾type-phenotype correlations.
Materials and Methods
Patient population
All patients and relatives signed written informed consent in accordance with the Declaration
of Helsinki. The study was approved by local Bioethics Committee of Institute of Cardiology
with approval number 1276.
The study cohort was drawn from all index patients referred for clinical genetic testing to
Unit for Screening Studies in Inherited Cardiovascular Diseases with the diagnosis of DCM
from 2012 to 2014. The cohort comprised of 72 unrelated DCM probands, all were Caucasian,
48 were male (66.7%). In addition, we performed segregation study among available 44 rela￾tives of TTN truncating mutation positive probands. DCM was defined according to ESC
(European Society of Cardiology) criteria, with left ventricular ejection fraction below 45%
and left ventricular end-diastolic diameter >117% of the predicted value corrected for age and
body surface area [7]. In all probands, coronary angiography, or more recently coronary com￾puted tomography angiography was performed. Data concerning the heart transplant recipi￾ents were reviewed to confirm the diagnosis of DCM prior to heart transplantation. The
disease was considered as familial when two subjects in the family met the same diagnostic cri￾teria for DCM as proband. Diagnostic criteria in relatives were defined based on position state￾ment of the ESC Working Group on Myocardial and Pericardial Diseases published by Pinto
et al [8], with definite disease in relatives who met criteria for DCM. Definitely affected status
was only assigned when systolic dysfunction was present with LVEF50% and LVEDD>117%
in patients who had no other known causes (including coronary artery disease (CAD)) leading
to systolic dysfunction. Probable disease was diagnosed in the relatives, carriers of causative
mutation in the proband, whenever one major criterion that is unexplained decrease of LVEF
50% but >45%, or unexplained LVED dilatation was present while possible disease, in the
same population, was diagnosed when one minor criterion was present, e.g. unexplained ven￾tricular arrhythmia (>100 ventricular premature beats per hour in 24h monitoring or non￾Titin Truncating Variants in Dilated Cardiomyopathy

sustained ventricular tachycardia 3 beats at a rate 120 beats per minute). However, simi￾larly as in probands, we used the method of Henry [9] in relation to indexation of left ventricu￾lar enddiastolic dimension as widely published and easy to make comparisons with other
publications. Medical records of relatives diagnosed in our center, who were hospitalized and/
or died earlier, were analyzed to ascertain familial form of the disease. Genetic testing was
offered to all probands and they all agreed to participate in the study. The informed and con￾senting relatives of the probands underwent a clinical examination, 12-lead electrocardiogra￾phy, two-dimensional Doppler echocardiography, 24-hour Holter electrocardiography (ECG)
monitoring, serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) examination and blood sampling for
genetic testing. Cardiac magnetic resonance study was performed based on clinical decision.
Mean age of probands at diagnosis was 33.8±13.6 years, and mean left ventricular ejection
fraction at diagnosis was 24%. Of 72 probands, 33 (45.8%) were with familial DCM (FDCM),
and 39 (54.2%) with sporadic DCM.
DNA sequencing and TTN mutation analysis
DNA was extracted from the peripheral blood by phenol extraction. Genetic testing in pro￾bands was performed using next generation sequencing (NGS). 44 patients were analyzed
by whole exome sequencing (WES), in 22 TruSight One (TSO) sequencing panel and in 6
sequencing of a custom panel of 35 genes involved in cardiomyopathies (ABCC9, ACTC1,
ACTN2, ANKRD1, BAG3, CRYAB, CSRP3, DES, EMD, ILK, LAMA4, LDB3, LMNA, MYBPC3,
MYH6, MYH7, MYL2, MYL3, MYPN, PDLIM3, PLN, PSEN1, PSEN2, RBM20, SCN5A, SGCD,
TAZ, TCAP, TMPO, TNNC1, TNNI3, TNNT2, TPM1, TTN, VCL) were performed. The
detailed NGS approach for each proband with TTN truncating variant found is given in S1
Table. WES libraries were constructed using TruSeq Exome Enrichment Kit (Illumina) or
Nextera Rapid Capture Exome Kit (Illumina) as described previously [10]. Except for the dif￾ferent set of enrichment probes TSO sequencing was performed similarly to WES. Targeted
sequencing of the 35 genes was performed using a custom design SeqCap EZ Choice Library
(Roche NimbleGen) of ~0.17 Mb target genomic sequences. Whole procedure was carried out
according to SeqCap EZ Library SR User’s Guide v.3.0. All libraries were pair-end sequenced
on Illumina HiSeq 1500 with minimum depth of 10 reads (ge10) for at least 80% of respective
NGS target regions and for 88.4% for the entire coding region of TTN defined as TTN
N2BA transcript NM_001256850.1. Mean ge10 was 97.5±1.99 for N2BA TTN transcript. The
mean coverage was 61.5±43.1 for NGS target regions and 66.6±41.0 for N2BA transcript
NM_001256850.1. The NGS parameters are given for N2BA transcript as we considered only
variants in cardiac TTN transcript NM_001256850.1.
TTN truncating variants identified with NGS were followed-up in probands and relatives
with Sanger sequencing using a 3500xL Genetic Analyzer (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA,
USA) and BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Life Technologies) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The results were analyzed with Variant Reporter 1.1 Software
(Life Technologies). List of primers specific to each TTN truncating variant is available in S2
Table. The frequencies of variants were compared to genomic databases: Phase 3 of 1000
Genomes (http://www.1000genomes.org/), NHLBI GO Exome Sequencing Project (ESP) 6500
(https://esp.gs.washington.edu/drupal/) and Version 0.3 of ExAC (http://exac.broadinstitute.
org/).

used for comparison of categorical variables. All tests were two-sided with the significance
level of p<0.05. Kaplan-Meier curves were compared with log-rank test. Statistical analyses
were performed with statistical package STATISTICA v6.
Results
Molecular findings in the DCM cohort
We identified 16 different TTN truncating variants (TTN trunc, one identified twice) in 17
(23.6%) of 72 subjects (Table 1). Ten of 33 FDCM probands (30.3%) carried a TTN truncating
variant (TTN trunc) compared to seven of 39 sporadic DCM cases (17.9%). There were ten non￾sense and six frameshift mutations but no splice variants. Of the 16 variants, 3 were described
before—two were found in large population study by Roberts et al. [11] (p.Arg31056 in end
stage of DCM and p.Arg21009 in the UK prospective DCM cohort) and one (p.Ser28693Ilefs2)
in a family with adult-onset DCM [12]. Fourteen variants (87.5%) were localized in the A-band
region, one (6.25%) was in the I-band, and one (6.25%) was located in the Z disc. (Fig 1, S3
Table). All of these TTN mutations were located in symmetric exons. The majority of probands
(15/17, 88.2%) had mutations localized in the A-band. The only variant found outside A-band
and adjacent region of I-band was found in a family where cosegregation was nearly full with
only one of 6 family members, 18 years old woman, being unaffected (see S2 Fig, family
DCM097).
To verify the possibility of relatedness of two probands sharing the same TTN truncating
variant we have used WES data and compared rare (<0.01 in databases cited above) variants
in coding sequence excluding sex chromosomes. After such filtering among 376 variants in
proband from DCM082 family and 223 variants in proband from DCM102 family the only
one shared variant between these patients was TTN truncating variant which suggest no relat￾edness. This conclusion is further supported by internal comparisons between samples from
related and unrelated subjects analyzed by WES in our lab for other purposes (i.e. 1–3 shared

variants found for 4 unrelated samples out of 296–335 variants, 34 variants shared between
two 4th degree relatives out of 252 and 276 variants in a similar analysis as described above).
In our group of 72 probands we also found 41 missense variants in cardiac transcript
N2BA– 10 in 17 TTN trunc carriers (58.8% of carriers), 30 in non-carriers (54.5% of non-carri￾ers) and 1 shared between two probands one with and the other without TTN truncating vari￾ant. Full list of missense TTN variants in our cohort is shown in S4 Table. While we did not
test if they are located on the same or the other allele as TTN truncating variants similar preva￾lence among carriers vs. non-carriers argues against significant effect among the latter.
Clinical characteristics of DCM probands. Table 2 shows comparison of clinical data in
TTN trunc positive (n = 17) versus TTN trunc negative DCM patients (n = 55). Conduction
disease was defined as the presence of left bundle branch block (LBBB) and/or atrioventricular
block (AVB). One TTN trunc positive proband had LBBB (5.9%) whereas among 55 TTN
trunc negative probands 21 (38.2%) had conduction disease (13 had LBBB, 4 had LBBB and
AVB, and 4 had AVB). However, the difference in prevalence of conduction disease between
TTN trunc carriers and noncarriers was not significant after correction for number of compar￾isons (n = 21) (Table 2). There were no significant differences in age at diagnosis, sex, the pres￾ence of familial disease, symptoms and cardiac assessment between these groups.
During mean 63 months from diagnosis there were 22 (30.5%) major adverse cardiac events
in the whole group (n = 72). Kaplan-Meier survival curve did not show difference in outcome
in TTN trunc carriers versus noncarriers (p = 0.843, log-rank test = -0.198, Fig 2).
Clinical characteristics of all TTN truncating mutations carriers. Evaluation of pro￾bands’ relatives identified 29 mutation carriers and 15 subjects without the mutation. Of the
total of 29 relatives with TTN mutations 9 relatives (31%) had definitely affected status, 8
(27.6%) had probably affected status and one (3.4%) had possibly affected status (Table 3). The
remaining 11 relatives (37.9%) were categorized as not affected. Of the 8 relatives with proba￾bly affected status 6 had left ventricular systolic dysfunction, and 2 had left ventricular dilata￾tion. One female relative was categorized as possible affected with bursts of non-sustained
ventricular tachycardia (nsVT) on 24-hour Holter electrocardiographic monitoring. Pedigrees
for 46 mutation carriers from 17 families of TTN trunc positive DCM families are shown in S1
and S2 Figs. Detailed combined clinical and genetic data of the 46 TTN truncating mutation
carriers are available on request from the authors.
S5 Table shows combined data on all TTN trunc positive carriers with DCM (n = 26) and
comparison of TTN trunc positive probands (n = 17) with TTN trunc positive DCM relatives
(n = 9). There was no difference in the severity of the disease at diagnosis (mean LVEF 24.5±
9.0% in probands and 28.1±12.1% in relatives, p = 0.49) and outcome between these two DCM
patients’ subgroups, namely major adverse cardiac events were present in 5/17 probands and
in 3/9 affected DCM relatives, p = NS.
Among TTN truncating mutation carriers disease penetrance and risk of major adverse
cardiac events are higher in males than females. Overall disease penetrance among relatives
carrying TTN truncating mutations was 62.1% and did not clearly increase with age being 60%

by age 50 (n = 20), 56% by age 60 (n = 25) and 62% by age 70 (n = 29). After excluding all unaf￾fected TTN trunc relatives younger than 40 years the penetrance was 82%. However, we noted
that in TTN trunc relatives older than 59 years (n = 5, 3 females) the penetrance was 100%.
We observed that the penetrance was sex dependent. Fig 3 presents Kaplan-Meier curves
for freedom from combined affected statuses (age at diagnosis for affected and age at genetic
inquest for not affected patients) in all TTN trunc carriers stratified by sex. Median age of
onset in males was estimated as 28 years (range from 26 to 30) and in females as 56 years
(range from 33 to 79) (p = 0.004, log-rank test = -2.91). Though we believe that there is no rea￾son to exclude probands, as the criterion used in this analysis is age of onset, which is indepen￾dent from patient’s proband/relative status, when the analysis was restricted to TTN trunc
relatives the effect was still statistically significant (p = 0.029, log-rank test = -2.18). Further￾more, according to Kaplan-Meier analysis based on all TTN trunc individuals the estimated
cumulative risk of DCM was 60.8% at the age of 33 and 95.1% at 61 years in males, and 17.6%
and 53.9% in females, respectively.

The incidence of major adverse cardiac events among those with TTN mutations was also sex
dependent. In all mutation carriers (n = 46), during 45.3±56.3 months of follow-up, 8 (17.4%) had
major adverse cardiac events. Fig 4 shows Kaplan-Meier survival curve indicating worse prognosis
in male carriers of TTN truncating variants in comparison to female carriers. The difference
between these two groups was statistically significant (p = 0.018, log-rank test = -2.37).
Additional possible disease causing variants. In 8/17 (47%) of TTN trunc positive pro￾bands additional rare (frequency lower than 0.005 in 1000Genomes, ESP, and ExAC data￾bases) variants in known cardiomyopathies’ genes were found, namely ACTN2, DSP, LDB3,
MYH6, MYH7, PKP2, SCN5A, TNNI3. All of them were missense variants with variable bioin￾formatics predictions of pathogenicity and clinical significance (S6 Table). Two of them were

described before: DSP variant as unclassified in proband with arrhythmogenic right ventricu￾lar cardiomyopathy [13] and MYH7 variant as possibly pathogenic but coexisting with another
possibly pathogenic variant in LDB3 gene in proband with familial dilated cardiomyopathy
[12]. The segregation of additional variants in studied families is included in S1 and S2 Figs.
Identification of additional variants in nearly half of probands carrying the TTN trunc
raised a question about their possible influence on outcome. Among 9 affected relatives of
these probands, 7 (78%) had also additional variants, there were only 2 affected TTN trunc
positive relatives in whom additional variant was not present whereas none of the affected rela￾tives carried only the additional variant. Taken together these data are consistent with the
hypothesis that in these families DCM is caused by TTN trunc but the numbers are too small
for definite conclusions.
Discussion
While studying 72 DCM patients we identified 16 different TTN truncating variants, 13 of
them novel. An important feature of our study is the examination of young DCM patient pop￾ulation with a mean age of 34 years.

Titin Truncating Variants in Dilated Cardiomyopathy
PLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0169007 January 3, 2017 8 / 14

The observed frequency of TTN truncating variants among our unselected young DCM
patient population (23.6%) is similar as in previously published cohorts, i.e. between 11 and
22% [2, 5, 6, 14, 15]. We found even higher (30.3%) frequency of TTN trunc variants in familial
DCM again similar to previous reports (between 18 and 27%). Our young DCM cohort was
characterized by advanced heart failure with nearly half of the patients with documented famil￾ial disease. This is in agreement with current guidelines recommending genetic testing mainly
in patients with clear-cut phenotype. As in the study by Herman et al. [2], subjects with DCM,
both with and without TTN truncating variants, had generally similar clinical manifestations
including the risk of major cardiac events. Similarly, as in the study by Herman et al., we
found that in our patients DCM caused by TTN trunc is usually unaccompanied by conduc￾tion disease (in particular none of the TTN trunc carriers had AVB).

Titin Truncating Variants in Dilated Cardiomyopathy
PLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0169007 January 3, 2017 9 / 14

In our group 82.2% TTN truncating mutations were located in the symmetric exons of an
A-band region. The A-band region, critical for biomechanical sensing and signaling, is orga￾nized in repeats containing numerous FN-III domains interspersed with Ig domains providing
repetitive binding sites for myosin and thick filament associated proteins [16]. Our findings
are consistent with the recent study by Roberts et al. who demonstrated that in end-stage
DCM TTN truncating mutations occur predominantly in the A-band [6].
Only one proband had TTN truncating variant in the Z-disc region which confirms that
this region is rarely mutated in patients with DCM. To our best knowledge only a few TTN
variants located in Z-disc have been published so far in patients with DCM. These include
Fig 4. Kaplan-Meier cumulative survival curves for SAE (HF death, OHT or LVAD) in 46 carriers of TTN truncating variants, males and
females, p = 0.018, log-rank test = -2.37.

three missense mutations [14, 17] and two truncating variants [6]. As penetrance was nearly
full in our family with Z-disc variant we did not exclude the family from survival analyses.
TTN truncating mutations are more likely to be disease-causing when they occur in exons
which are abundantly transcribed and located closer to the carboxyl end of the protein [6].
Our results suggest that TTN truncating variants, even when they meet the criteria mentioned
above, are characterized by incomplete and sex-related penetrance. We found incomplete pen￾etrance in TTN trunc relatives carriers that was 62.1% when all affected statuses were com￾bined and 82% after exclusion of unaffected relatives under 40. In the study by Akinrinade
et al. disease penetrance increased from 53.8% at age 50 to 84.6% at age 60 and 100% at age 70
[3]. In the study by Jansweijer et al, the penetrance of DCM in TTN relatives was 29% at the
age of 50 (n = 49), had increased to 58% at the age of 60 (n = 43), and further to 83% at the age
of 70 (n = 36) [18]. The varied and incomplete penetrance suggests a potential role of other
genetic/environmental factors in the disease onset in DCM related titinopathy. It was shown
by Cheng et al. that levels of genes’ expression can vary even among individuals of the same
family and in this way influence the penetrance of mutation [19]. Furthermore, manifestation
of clinical symptoms of pathogenic mutations is more likely to appear with increasing age
of individual which, again, was showed for HCM and MYBPC3 mutations [20] or Emery￾Dreifuss muscular dystrophy and LMNA [21]. Our data show for the first time strong sex
related difference with regard to estimated median age of disease onset in men (median 28
years) and women (median 56 years, p = 0.004). Furthermore, we found better prognosis
(lower incidence of serious adverse cardiac events) in women than in men carrying TTN
truncating mutations which is similar as in LMNA mutation carriers [22], and consistent
with the report of Herman et al. [2]. The sex related difference in disease severity is interest￾ing as it suggests a potential for interventions ameliorating DCM course in males. In partic￾ular, it would be interesting to study whether the higher disease severity in males could be
related to the recently demonstrated link between TTN phosphorylation and increased oxi￾dative stress [23].
Of note, severity of the disease and rates of major adverse cardiac events defined as cardiac
transplantation, implantation of a left ventricular assist device and death from cardiac causes,
were not different when comparing DCM probands and relatives affected with DCM.
Limitations
Our population drawn from patients referred for clinical genetic testing introduces some bias
towards more severely ill, with prominent family history. Also our Institute is one of leading
cardiac transplant centers in Poland, patients with more advanced diseases are referred here,
and patients with familial background are more willing to have their disease thoroughly clari￾fied. Furthermore, we acknowledge that our findings should be interpreted with caution due
to small patient numbers.
During a long period of time when probands were tested NGS procedures were improved
and refined which led to wide ranges of NGS parameters like ge10 or sequencing depth. The
minimum coverage of sequencing was showed as mean ge10 instead of widely used mean ge20
because this parameter was more stable than ge20.
Conclusions
TTN truncating variants were observed in nearly one fourth of young DCM probands with
sex-related differences in disease penetrance and severity which should be taken into account
in genetic counselling.
