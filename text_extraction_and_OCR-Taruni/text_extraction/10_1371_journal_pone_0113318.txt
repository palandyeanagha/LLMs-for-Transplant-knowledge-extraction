Abstract
Signal integration between IFNc and TLRs in immune cells has been associated
with the host defense against pathogens and injury, with a predominant role of
STAT1. We hypothesize that STAT1-dependent transcriptional changes in vascular
cells involved in cross-talk between IFNc and TLR4, reflect pro-atherogenic
responses in human atherosclerosis. Genome-wide investigation identified a set of
STAT1-dependent genes that were synergistically affected by interactions between
IFNc and TLR4 in VSMCs. These included the chemokines Cxcl9, Ccl12, Ccl8,
Ccrl2, Cxcl10 and Ccl5, adhesion molecules Cd40, Cd74, and antiviral and
antibacterial genes Rsad2, Mx1, Oasl1, Gbp5, Nos2, Batf2 and Tnfrsf11a. Among
the amplified genes was also Irf8, of which Ccl5 was subsequently identified as a
new pro-inflammatory target in VSMCs and ECs. Promoter analysis predicted
transcriptional cooperation between STAT1, IRF1, IRF8 and NFkB, with the novel
role of IRF8 providing an additional layer to the overall complexity. The synergistic
interactions between IFNc and TLR4 also resulted in increased T-cell migration and
impaired aortic contractility in a STAT1-dependent manner. Expression of the
chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10 correlated with STAT1 phosphorylation in
vascular cells in plaques from human carotid arteries. Moreover, using data mining
of human plaque transcriptomes, expression of a selection of these STAT1-
dependent pro-atherogenic genes was found to be increased in coronary artery

disease (CAD) and carotid atherosclerosis. Our study provides evidence to suggest
that in ECs and VSMCs STAT1 orchestrates a platform for cross-talk between IFNc
and TLR4, and identifies a STAT1-dependent gene signature that reflects a pro￾atherogenic state in human atherosclerosis.
Introduction
Inflammation participates importantly in host defenses against infectious agents
and injury, but it also contributes to the pathophysiology of many diseases
including atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is characterized by early endothelial cell
(EC) dysfunction and altered contractility of vascular smooth muscle cells
(VSMCs) [1]. Recruitment of blood leukocytes to the injured vascular
endothelium characterizes the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis and
involves many inflammatory mediators, modulated by cells of both innate and
adaptive immunity [2].
The pro-inflammatory cytokine interferon (IFN)-c, derived from T-cells, is
vital for both innate and adaptive immunity and is also expressed at high levels in
atherosclerotic lesions. Evidence that IFNc is necessary and sufficient to cause
vascular remodeling is supported by mouse models of atheroma formation, as the
serological neutralization or genetic absence of IFNc markedly reduces the extent
of atherosclerosis [3, 4, 5, 6]. The signal transduction pathway initiated by binding
of IFNc to its receptor leads to intracellular phosphorylation of signal transducer
and activator of transcription (STAT)1. Subsequently, STAT1 homodimerizes and
translocates into the nucleus where it binds to IFNc-activated sequences (GAS
elements) in the promoters of IFNc-inducible genes or at other sites by further
interaction with other transcription factors [7], including members of the
Interferon Regulatory Factor (IRF) family [8, 9]. Thus, STAT1 plays a major role
in mediating immune and pro-inflammatory responses. As such, IFNc is
considered to participate in promoting atherogenic responses through STAT1-
mediated ‘‘damaging’’ signals, regulating the functions and properties of all cell
types present in the vessel wall. Indeed, Agrawal et al. revealed that STAT1
positively influences lesion formation in experimental atherosclerosis in vivo and
is required for optimal progression of foam cell formation in macrophages in vitro
and in vivo [10]. However, the specific role for STAT1 in human atherosclerosis
has not been previously reported.
STAT1 has also been identified as an important mediator in the biological
response to different Toll like receptors (TLRs), which are innate immune pattern
recognition receptors (PRR) expressed on a variety of cells, and initiate and
sustain the inflammatory response in atherosclerosis [11]. Activation of TLR4
through lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which is mediated by both NFkB and IRF3,
leads to the induction of various target genes including type I IFNs, pro￾inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and cell surface molecules [12]. Some of

these genes are regulated secondary to LPS-induced IFNb, which after secretion
binds to the type I IFN receptor to activate gene expression in a STAT1-dependent
manner [7]. Cross-talk between IFNc and TLRs has been associated with the host
defense against pathogens and injury. IFNc produced by T-cells and other cells is
considered to enhance TLR signaling in dendritic cells and macrophages for the
efficient induction of inflammatory mediators to eliminate pathogens [13, 14].
STAT1 has been identified as a critical mediator in this cross-talk between IFNc
and TLR signaling pathways [15, 16]. Consequently, the cooperation of STAT1
with other transcription factors, including IRFs and NFkB, coordinate the
antimicrobial and inflammatory synergism between IFNc and TLRs in immune
cells. Recently, we showed that also in ECs and VSMCs cross-talk between IFNc
and TLR4 resulted in augmented STAT1 phosphorylation and increased
expression of the chemokine CXCL10 and the adhesion molecule ICAM-1 as well
as adhesion of U937 leukemia cells to ECs, in a STAT1- and TLR4-dependent
manner [17]. We hypothesize that STAT1-dependent transcriptional changes in
vascular cells involved in cross-talk between IFNc and TLR4, reflect pro￾atherogenic responses in human atherosclerosis.
Our study indeed provides evidence that in ECs and VSMCs STAT1
coordinates a platform for cross-talk between IFNc and TLR4, and identifies a
STAT1-dependent gene signature that reflects a pro-atherogenic state in coronary
artery disease (CAD) and carotid atherosclerosis.
Materials and Methods
Cell culture experiments
This investigation conforms with the principles of the NIH Guide for the Care and
Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH Publication, 8th Edition, 2011) and the German
Law on the Protection of Animals was followed. Researchers in charge of the
experiment, at Klinikum rechts der Isar were authorized to breed, house, and
sacrifice animals. WT mice (strain background C57BL/6) were obtained from
Charles River Laboratories. STAT12/2 and IRF82/2 mice (both C57BL/6
background) were kindly provided by Thomas Decker and Carol Stocking,
respectively [18]. Before any manipulations, animals were euthanized by cervical
dislocation under isoflurane anesthesia. Primary murine Vascular Smooth Muscle
cells (VSMCs) were isolated from C57BL/6 or STAT12/2 or IRF82/2 aortas by
enzymatic digestion [19]. Human Microvascular Endothelial Cells (ECs) [20]
obtained from Centers for disease control and prevention that were used in
current study, were cultivated in MCDB-131 (Life Technologies) medium
containing 10% FBS (PAA), 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin,
0.01 mg/ml EGF, 0.05 mM hydrocortisone (Sigma), 2 mM L-glutamine (PAA). On
the day before the experiment for both cell types full medium was exchanged into
medium containing 2% serum. Afterwards, cells were treated with 10 ng/ml of
IFNc (Life Technologies, PMC4031) and/or 1 mg/ml of LPS (Sigma, L4391).

RNA isolation and real-time PCR
Total RNA was isolated from VSMCs and ECs using RNAeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen,
74104) together with DNAse digestion step according to the manufacture’s
protocol. Isolated aortas were cleaned from perivascular fat and incubated as
depicted in Fig. 1. After stimulation aortas were snap frozen on liquid nitrogen,
ground up with a pestle and resuspended in 1 ml of Trizol. Total RNA was
isolated using Trizol method followed by PureLink RNA kit (Life Technologies,
12183018A). Complementary DNA was synthesized using iScript cDNA Synthesis
Kit (BioRad, 170-881), according to manufacturer’s protocol. Quantitative reverse
transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed using SSoFast Evagreen (MyiQ
ICycler, Bio-Rad, 172-5201). Forward and reverse primers are depicted in Table
S4. The 22ddCt method was applied for quantification [21]. Fold change in the
target gene were normalized to GAPDH and relative to the mean expression at
untreated sample. The results are expressed as fold of control from at least 3
independent assays.
Microarray analysis
VSMCs from WT and STAT12/2 were treated as described in Fig. 1. RNA from
control and treated samples was isolated and labeled according to Illumina
TotalPrep RNA Amplification Kit (Life Technologies, AMIL1791). Standard
Illumina Expression BeadChip MouseRef-8v2 (Illumina) hybridization protocol
was used to obtain the raw data. Chips were scanned using HiScanSQ system. The
complete data of the Illumina Expresion BeadChip analysis can be found at the
NCBI GEO, with the accession number GSE49519. The average signals from 3
independent biological experiments were taken for statistical testing. Genes from
treated samples with detection p-value ,0.05 were selected for background
subtraction and quantile normalization. Up-regulated genes were considered with
p-value ,0.05 and at least 2-fold difference. Genes which expression after co￾treatment reached higher level than additive expression after IFNc or LPS were
considered as amplified. Regulated genes in WT cells which expression was
lowered at least by 50% or fold induction was smaller than 2 in STAT12/2 was
considered as a STAT1 target. For comparison of up-regulated genes Venn
diagram tool was used (http://bioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/index.html) [22].
Gene names from data sets were used for identifying overlapping genes.
Promoters for amplified STAT1 dependent genes were screened using
GENOMATIX software (http://www.genomatix.de/) [23]. The promoter regions
from 21000 to +100 bp were searched for binding sites (V$IRF1.01 V$ISGF3G.01
V$ISRE.01 V$ISRE.02V$CREL.01 V$NFKAPPAB.01 V$NFKAPPAB.02
V$NFKAPPAB65.01 V$STAT.01 V$STAT1.01 V$STAT1.02) or models with core
similarity at least 0.85. Enrichment in gene ontology processes categories was
performed using Gorilla software (http://cbl-gorilla.cs.technion.ac.il/) [24]. P￾value of 1023 was used as a threshold and Illumina gene lists from HumanHT-12
v4 or MouseRef-8 v2 were taken as a background model. Next, all the statistically
significant and enriched gene ontology categories were analyzed by Revigo

software (http://revigo.irb.hr/) [25]. To remove redundant GO terms the allowed
similarity value of 0.5 was used.
In silico gene expression analysis
Human atherosclerotic plaque datasets were downloaded from NCBI Gene
Expression Omnibus repository. Carotid dataset (accession no. GSE21545 [26]
contained 223 microarrays (124 samples were used for the analysis) and coronary
dataset (accession no. GSE40231 [27] contained 278 samples (80 arrays were used
for the analysis)). As GSE21545 did not contain any healthy artery controls, these
samples were compared against controls from GSE40231. For this purpose, batch
effects between the combined datasets were removed using ComBat tool, a widely
used method for removing variations between batches of arrays [28]. In both cases
the authors isolated RNA from whole plaques obtained from patients during
surgery.
Raw.cel files downloaded from GEO were normalized using RMA algorithm,
signals were log-transformed and probes were combined to genes using ‘‘Combine

probes to genes’’ tool (Chipster software [29]). Fold change and corresponding p￾values were calculated using ‘‘calculate fold change’’ tool (Chipster [29]). Genes
up-regulated at least 1.5 times in both datasets were compared with a list of 30
genes amplified by IFNc and LPS treatment in VSMCs.
The list of STAT1 target genes up-regulated by IFNc and LPS in murine VSMCs
was used as the starting point for promoter analysis. First, that list was fed to
pSCAN online promoter analysis tool in order to look for GAS, interferon
stimulated response element ISRE (recognized by IRFs) and NFkB binding sites.
The software was set to analyse 950 bp upstream and 50 bp downstream of the
transcription start site. PSCAN produced a list of over-represented transcription
factor binding sites together with occurrences of each site and a matrix similarity
score. Occurrences having the score of at least 0.8 were fed into MatDefine
(Genomatix software package) to create a highly conserved matrix for each
transcription factor binding site. The settings were as follows: tuple size – 8; no. of
sequences containing tuple – 60%; matrix similarity score for sequence inclusion –
0.9. Matrices for GAS, ISRE and NFkB binding sites were then used in pSCAN as
«user supplied matrices» to search for occurrences in genes two-fold upregulated
in the atherosclerotic plaque datasets.
ChIP-qPCR
ChIP was performed as previously described [30] with minor modifications.
Briefly, VSMCs were stimulated as depicted in Fig. 1 and next crosslinked with 1%
formaldehyde for 10 minutes. After fixation chromatin was sonicated with a
Diagenode Bioraptor to generate 200–1000 bp fragments. Chromatin was
immunoprecipitated with pre-immune IgG (Millipore, 12–371B), or with an
antibody against STAT1 (Santa Cruz, sc-346) or IRF1 (Santa Cruz, sc-13041X) or
NFkB (Santa Cruz, sc-398442X). Chromatin-antibody complexes were precipi￾tated with agarose beads according to the EZ ChIP protocol (Millipore, 17-371).
After DNA fragments were column purified DNA concentration was measured
with a Qubit fluorometer. Immunoprecipitated DNA was quantified by qPCR
(primers for Cxcl10: 59-CCTGTAAACCGAGGGCATTG-39, 59-
CACGCTTTGGAAAGTGAAAC-39) and normalized to values obtained after
amplification of unprecipitated (input) DNA.
Western blot analysis
Total IRF8, STAT1 (Santa Cruz, sc6058, sc346), GAPDH and phosphorylated
STAT1 (Cell Signaling, 5174s, 9171l) were determined by western blotting in
VSMCs and HMECs. After treatment cells were homogenized in a Ripa lysis buffer
(Sigma) containing phosphatases and proteases inhibitors (Roche). Protein
concentration was determined using a bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit
(Thermo Fisher Scientific). 40 mg of protein per lane was loaded and resolved by
SDS-poly-acrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) under reducing conditions.
Proteins were transferred onto PVDV (Millipore) membrane. After incubation

with primary and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Santa
Cruz), immunoreactivity was detected by adding Luminata Forte Western
Substrate (EMD Millipore) and measured by INTAS imaging system (Intas,
Germany).
Cytokine detection ELISA
Expression of murine Cxcl10, Ccl5 (Peprotech) as well as Cxcl9 (Sigma) was
performed on medium remained after treatment of VSMCs using sandwich ELISA
tests according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Measurement of nitric oxide (NO)
VSMCs were treated as depicted in cell experiment section. After treatment
medium was refreshed and cells were cultivated for further 24 h. Subsequently
medium was collected and 100 ul was used to measure amount of NO by Griess
diazotization reaction [31]. Medium was incubated with freshly prepared solution
containing 1% sulfanilamide 5% HCl, 0.1% aqueous solution of 2-(1-
Naphthylamino)ethylamine dihydrochloride (Sigma). After 10 min incubation
OD at 560 mm was measured and compared to the standard curve.
Migration assay
Migration assay was performed according to Guo et al [32]. Briefly, 106 of isolated
red blood cells depleted splenocytes isolated from WT mice, were loaded into the
upper chamber of Transwell 24-well plates (Corning, 3421). The bottom chamber
was filled with 600 ul of the medium collected after treatment of VSMCs with
LPS, IFNc or IFNc and LPS. After incubation for 3 h at 37˚C, migrated cells were
stained with CD45FITC and CD3APC antibody (Miltenyi Biotec 130091609,
130092977) and analyzed by flow cytometer (Miltenyi Biotec).
Ex vivo contractility studies
Isolated aortas were cleaned from perivascular fat, cut into 2 mm long rings (for
myograph) and placed in a DMEM medium containing 2% FBS (Sigma). Next,
aortas were treated with 10 ng/ml of IFNc and/or 1 mg/ml of LPS. Vascular
contractility studies were performed according to the technique described by
Mulvany et al. [33]. After treatment, 2 mm long rings were mounted in a 4-
channel myograph (620M, Danish Myo Technology, Aarhus, Denmark) in the
organ chamber filled with physiological saline solution (PSS) containing
118.99 mM NaCl, 4,69 mM KCl, 1.17 mM MgSO4*7H2O, 1.18 mM KH2PO4,
2.5 mM CaCl2*2H2O, 25 mM NaHCO3, 0.03 mM EDTA, 5.5 mM Glucose.
During the experiment PSS buffer was aerated with carbogen (95% O2+5%CO2).
After calibration, vessels were pre-streched to obtain optimal passive tension.
Next, vascular functions were analyzed. Contractility was evaluated by substitu￾tion of PSS buffer for high potassium physiological saline solution (KPSS;

74.7 mM NaCl, 60 mM KCl, 1.17 mM MgSO4*7H2O, 1.18 mM KH2PO4,
1.6 mM CaCl2, 14.9 mM NaHCO3, 0.026 mM EDTA, 5.5 mM Glucose). For
testing viability, vessels were subjected to noradrenaline-induced constriction
followed by acetylcholine dilation (Sigma). After washing out with PSS buffer and
resting for 15 minutes, noradrenaline dose-response curves was performed.
Noradrenaline was used in stepwise increased, cumulative concentration ranging
from 10211 to 1026 mol/L. To study vasodilatation, sodium nitroprusside
(Sigma) was used in concentrations from 10210 to 1025 mol/L.
Histology and immunohistochemistry
Histological analyses and immunohistochemistry were performed on represen￾tative sections (2–3 mm) of formalin fixed in paraffin embedded tissue samples
from six human carotid atherosclerotic lesions and four healthy controls. The
human tissue samples used in our study were procured from Biobank of
Department of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (Klinikum rechts der Isar der
Technischen Universitaet Muenchen). Collecting of specimens for the mentioned
Biobank was approved by the local ethics committee (Ethikkommission der
Fakultaet fuer Medizin der Technischen Universitaet Muenchen) and written
informed consent was given by all patients. Haemalaun-Eosin (HE) and Elastica￾van-Gieson (EvG) staining were performed in order to assess sample morphology.
For characterisation of the cells within atherosclerotic plaques, specimens were
treated with antibodies against vascular smooth muscle cells (smooth muscle
myosin heavy chain 1 and 2 (SM-M10), rabbit polyclonal, dilution 1:4.000
(Abcam, ab81031) and endothelial cells (anti-CD31, mouse monoclonal, clone
JC70A, dilution 1:100; Dako).
For the detection of specific cytokines, CXCL9 (MIG) and CXCL10 (IP10), as
well as the phosphorylated transcription factor STAT1, following primary
antibodies were used: rabbit polyclonal anti-MIG (Abcam, ab9720; dilution
1:500), rabbit polyclonal anti-IP10 (Abcam, ab47045; dilution 1:200), and rabbit
monoclonal phospho-Stat1 (Cell Signaling, 9171l; dilution 1:400). All antibodies
were first optimised on tonsil using different dilutions, staining conditions and
with or without blocking. Optimal results were achieved by blocking anti-MIG
and anti-phospho-Stat1 with goat serum, anti-IP10 without the blocking
procedure.
Following incubation with primary antibody visualisation was performed by
peroxidase/DAB ChemMate Detection Kit according to the manufacturer’s
instruction (biotinylated goat anti-mouse/anti-rabbit secondary Ab; Dako).
Statistical Analysis
Data are presented as mean ¡ SEM. For comparisons between more than two
groups one-way ANOVA with Tukey post-hoc test was used. In all other
experiments comparing two groups, Student’s t-test was used. A probability value
,0.05 was considered statistically significant (GraphPad Prism 5.0). In

contractility studies, two-way ANOVA test with Bonferroni post hoc test was
used.
Results
IFNc and LPS synergistically induce CXCL10 expression in
VSMCs, depending on STAT1
Recently, we showed that in ECs cross-talk between IFNc and TLR4 resulted in
augmented STAT1 phosphorylation and increased expression of the chemokine
CXCL10 [17]. To study if a similar mechanism affected the expression of Cxcl10
in VSMCs, these cells were isolated from WT and STAT12/2 mice and treated as
depicted in Fig. 1. In WT-VSMCs, treatment with IFNc or LPS alone induced
expression of Cxcl10 at the mRNA (Fig. 1A) as well as at the protein level (
Fig. 1B). Furthermore, pre-treatment with IFNc for 4 h followed by LPS for
another 4 h led to synergistic amplification of Cxcl10 expression compared with
both factors alone (Fig. 1A and 1B). In contrast, this IFNc and LPS-induced
synergistic amplification in Cxcl10 gene expression was dramatically abrogated in
STAT12/2-VSMCs (Fig. 1A), which coincided with Cxcl10 protein levels in the
medium (Fig. 1B) and correlated with a predominant STAT1-dependent
mechanism.
Transcriptional responses in IFNc and LPS treated VSMCs predict
dependence on STAT1, NFkB and IRF
Next, we compared genome-wide transcriptional responses of WT-VSMCs to LPS
(4 h) or IFNc (8 h) alone, or after combined treatment (IFNc 8 h, LPS 4 h). IFNc
changed the expression of 297 and LPS of 553 genes under these conditions (
Fig. 2A). The interactions between IFNc and LPS (Fig. 2A) increased the number
of up-regulated genes to 990. While 128 of the IFNc-regulated genes were
modulated by LPS (Fig. 2A), 118 were also commonly regulated by IFNc+LPS.
Likewise, we compared transcriptional responses of STAT12/2-VSMCs to LPS or
IFNc alone, or after combined treatment. Only 16 genes were found to be up￾regulated by IFNc in STAT12/2-VSMCs, highlighting the importance of STAT1 in
this response pathway. In contrast, LPS treatment of STAT12/2-VSMCs was
similar to WT-VSMCs, with a total of 470 genes being modulated. However, in
general the potency of the response was lower as compared to WT-VSMCs.
Consequently, the additive or synergistic effect of IFNc and LPS as seen in WT￾VSMCs, was no longer present in STAT12/2-VSMCs. Only 493 genes were
upregulated by IFNc+LPS, of which 323 were in common with LPS alone. The
complete list of up and down-regulated genes in response to IFNc or LPS alone,
or after combined treatment is shown in Table S1, S2 and S3, respectively.
Subsequently, we aimed at identifying the genes, that similar to Cxcl10 were
synergistically affected by the interactions between IFNc and LPS, and their
dependency on STAT1. Table 1 shows the top 30 synergistically amplified genes of

which the expression was at least 2-fold higher upon stimulation with IFNc+LPS
as compared to the sum of the treatments with both factors alone. For example,
expression of Cxcl9 was .15-fold higher after combined treatment [2643.5-fold

The table introduces genes that expression is at least 2-fold higher upon stimulation with IFNc+LPS as compared to the sum of the treatments with both factors alone (see column
‘‘Signal integration’’). Other numbers represent fold changes compared to control. Cross indicates presence of specific sequence in the promoter regions.

increased by IFNc+LPS, divided by 171 times as the sum of IFNc (150.73) and
LPS (20.25) alone] as compared to the single treatments.
Subsequently, by grouping these 30 genes based on their response pattern in
WT-VSMCs to IFNc or LPS (Fig. 2B), we could distinguish five groups of genes (
Fig. 2C). The first group contained genes with high response to both IFNc and
LPS that were highly amplified after combined treatment (Cluster A in Table 1
and Fig. 2C). These include Cxcl9, Cxcl10, Rsad2 and Gbp5. The expression of a
second group of genes, including Batf2, Ubd, Cd74, Fam26f and Serpina3g,
showed high response to IFNc, mild response to LPS, and high amplification after
combined treatment (Cluster B in Table 1 and Fig. 2C). In contrast, a third group
of genes showed a mild or no response to IFNc, high response to LPS, and again
high amplification after combined treatment (Cluster C in Table 1 and Fig. 2C).
This group was exemplified by Ccl5, Tnfaip2, Cd40, Lincr and Nos2 (iNOS). The
fourth group of genes consisted of Ccrl2, Mx1, Has1, Oasl1, MCP-2, Atf3, Ifi205,
Upp1 and Tnfrsf11a and displayed mild or no response to IFNc, mild response to
LPS, and mild amplification after combined treatment (Cluster D in Table 1 and
Fig. 2C). Finally, we could also identify genes which showed minor or no response
to IFNc and LPS alone, but were highly amplified in expression after combined
treatment [e.g., Irf8, MCP-5, Sectm1a, Gja4, Egr2, Itpk1 and Etsrp71] (Cluster E in
Table 1 and Fig. 2C).
In general, the absence of STAT1 severely abrogated the IFNc-induced
expression of all of these 30 genes. On the other hand, the LPS response of 50% of
genes listed in Table 1, was decreased in the absence of STAT1. Consequently, the
synergistic effect of IFNc and LPS as seen in WT-VSMCs, was no longer present in
STAT12/2-VSMCs. As the only exception, the IFNc-induced expression of MCP￾2 appeared STAT1-independent, with a similar fold induction in WT and
STAT12/2 VSMCs (Table 1, 6.12 vs. 5.12). In contrast, absence of STAT1
increased its response to LPS (Table 1, 3.75 vs. 44.53).
Successive promoter analysis of the genes listed in Table 1, predicted the
presence of STAT-NFkB and IRF-NFkB modules or combinations of separate
ISRE, STAT or NFkB binding sites, strongly implicating the cooperative
involvement of NFkB, STAT1 and/or IRFs in the transcriptional regulation of all
of these genes in response to IFNc and LPS.
Transcriptional responses in IFNc and LPS treated VSMCs and
ECs predict a pro-atherogenic phenotype
Gene ontology (GO) functional analysis of the top 30 genes listed in Table 1,
revealed significant enrichment in biological functions involved in host defense,
immune response, inflammatory response, cytokine response, response to stress
and to wound healing (Table 2). All these categories generally recognize a similar
group of genes, including the chemokines Cxcl9, Ccl12, Ccl8, Ccl5, Cxcl10 and
Ccrl2, adhesion molecules (Cd40, Cd74), and the antiviral and antibacterial
response genes Irf8, Rsad2, Mx1, Oasl1, Gbp5, Nos2, Batf2 and Tnfrsf11a.
Together, these genes reflect an enhanced pro-inflammatory and pro-atherogenic

profile that is mediated by interactions between IFNc and LPS in VSMCs and
strongly depends on STAT1.
The expression of the chemokines Ccl5, Cxcl9, Ccl12 and chemokine receptor
Ccrl2 (not shown) was additionally examined by qPCR and ELISA (Fig. 3), and
confirmed the microarray data. In agreement with Table 1, the response of this
selected group of genes was severely abolished in STAT12/2-VSMCs, confirming
the importance of STAT1 in the signal integration between IFNc and LPS.
Because we were not able to isolate a homogeneous population of mouse aortic
endothelial cells (data not shown), we instead used the human microvascular
endothelial cell-line, HMEC [20]. Pre-treatment of HMECs with IFNc for 4 h
followed by LPS for another 4 h resulted in a similar amplification pattern of Ccl5,
Cxcl9 and Cxcl10 (Fig. 3C) as in WT-VSMCs, providing evidence for a universal
STAT1-dependent mechanism in vascular cells triggered by IFNc and LPS.
Similarly, we were able to observe a synergistic amplification after IFNc and LPS
treatment of Cxcl9 and Cxcl10 in ex vivo treated aortic rings of WT animals as
compared to IFNc or LPS alone (Fig. 3D)
Finally, Chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-qPCR of untreated WT￾VSMCs or treated with IFNc, LPS or IFNc+LPS and using antibodies against
STAT1 NFkB, IRF1 or IgG, clearly showed enhanced binding of these different
transcription factors to the ISRE and NFkB binding elements of the Cxcl10 gene,
as compared to IgG controls (Fig. 3E). In a representative experiment, STAT1
binding to the ISRE increased after IFNc as well as LPS treatment, but not after
IFNc+LPS stimulation. IRF1 binding was enriched upon treatment with IFNc
alone and after subsequent stimulation with LPS. LPS alone, on the other hand
did not affect IRF1 binding. Finally, NFkB binding dramatically increased when
cells were first treated with IFNc and then by LPS, but not in the presence of IFNc
or LPS alone (Fig. 3E). This confirms the cooperative involvement of STAT1,
NFkB and IRF1 in the transcriptional regulation of Cxcl10 in response to IFNc
and LPS as predicted in Table 1.

IRF8 mediates IFNc and LPS induced Ccl5 expression in vascular
cells
Notably, the transcription factor IRF8, which was thought to be restricted to
lymphoid-cell lineages such as B-, T-, dendritic cells and macrophages, was
identified among the amplified genes. Indeed, gene (Fig. 4A left panel) and
protein expression (Fig. 4B left panel) of IRF8 in WT and STAT12/2 VSMCs in
response to IFNc, LPS or IFNc+LPS, confirmed the microarray data. Interestingly,
pre-treatment of ECs with IFNc for 4 h followed by LPS for another 4 h resulted
in a similar amplification pattern of IRF8 RNA (Fig. 4A right panel) and protein
expression (Fig. 4B right panel) as in WT-VSMCs. These results provide evidence
for STAT1-dependent expression of IRF8 in VSMCs and ECs upon treatment with

IFNc, and confirm amplification of IRF8 upon stimulation with IFNc and LPS in
vascular cells.
Next the IRF8 dependent regulation of Ccl5 (a known IRF8 target in immune
cells [34]) was examined. The amplified expression of Ccl5 RNA (Fig. 4C, left
panel) and protein (Fig. 4C, right panel) in response to IFNc and LPS, as seen in
WT VSMCs, was highly attenuated in IRF82/2 and STAT12/2 -VSMC. In
contrast, the expression of Cxcl10 and Cxcl9 in response to IFNc and LPS in WT
VSMCs was similar to that in IRF82/2-VSMCs (Fig. 4D).
Signal integration between IFNc and LPS in VSMCs leads to
increased migration of T-lymphocytes
Since many of the chemokines characterized above are involved in chemotaxis of
T-lymphocytes [35], we examined the effect of IFNc and LPS cross-talk on T-cell
migration towards conditioned medium from treated VSMCs. Amplification of
chemokines in WT-VSMCs upon stimulation with both stimuli indeed led to an
increased migration of CD3+
/CD45+ spleenocytes (Fig. 4E). Migration of CD3+
/
CD45+ cells towards medium of WT-VSMCs treated with both IFNc and LPS was
significantly higher (234%) as compared to both factors alone (125% and 175%,
respectively). As expected, the chemotactic response of splenocytes towards the
conditioned medium obtained after treatment of STAT12/2-VSMCs was highly
attenuated (Fig. 4E).
Signal integration between IFNc and LPS in aortic rings leads to
abolished response to norepinephrine and sodium nitroprusside
Among the genes that were highly amplified upon treatment with IFNc and LPS
was inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS, Nos2). Indeed, treatment of WT￾VSMCs but not STAT12/2 with IFNc and LPS caused amplified expression of
Nos2 as compared to stimulation with both factors alone (Fig. 5A). The RNA
levels reflected nitrite accumulation in the medium (Fig. 5B). Since dysregulation
of Nos2 expression and its activity affects vessel function, we evaluated the
physiological ramifications of these experimental conditions using a wire
myograph/organ chamber setting. Stimulation of the aortic rings isolated from
WT animals with IFNc and LPS resulted in drastic impairment of contractility
after subjection to norepinephrine treatment (Fig. 5C, left panel). WT vessels
treated with both IFNc and LPS manifested also high loss of the sensitivity to
sodium nitroprusside (Fig. 5D, left panel). In contrast to WT, aortic rings from

STAT1 activation and CXCL9 and CXCL10 expression in ECs and
VSMCs from human carotid atherosclerotic plaques
We performed immunohistochemistry staining for phosphorylated STAT1,
CXCL9 and CXCL10 in human advanced atherosclerotic plaques of carotid
arteries in comparison to healthy vessels. As can clearly be observed in Figure 6A,
VSMCs in the lesion highly expressed phosphorylated STAT1 and both
chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10. In contrast, healthy vessels were negative for all
three markers (Figure 6A). Moreover, ECs covering the plaque likewise showed
predominant staining for phosphorylated STAT1 and CXCL9, and to a lesser

extent for CXCL10 (Figure 6B). Again, healthy endothelium was negative.
Staining for IRF8 was more difficult to interpret, but seemed present at low levels
in SMCs (not shown).
STAT1-dependent pro-atherogenic target gene expression in
human atherosclerotic plaques
To obtain potential evidence for STAT1-mediated target gene expression in the
human atherosclerotic plaque, we performed different types of experiments. First,
we analyzed two independent microarray datasets obtained from human coronary
plaques and human carotid plaques. These datasets are available in GEO NCBI
database (acc. no. GSE40231 and GSE21545, respectively) [26, 27]. In coronary
and carotid plaques respectively we identified 1146 and 949 genes upregulated at
least 1.5 times as compared to the healthy arterial tissue (Figure 7A). 201 of those
genes are commonly expressed between the different plaque tissues, highly
implying that there are common features between coronary and carotid plaques
(Sikorski et al. [36]). Detailed promoter analysis of the differentially expressed
genes in carotid and coronary plaques identified 128 (Figure 7B) and 362
(Figure 7C) genes, respectively containing GAS, ISRE or NFkB sites, either alone
or in different combinations. This strongly suggests also the cooperative
involvement of NFkB, STAT1 and/or IRF in the transcriptional regulation of
genes in the plaque tissue.
Next we compared the 30 IFNc and LPS amplified STAT1-target genes listed in
Table 1 to the genes upregulated in carotid and coronary plaques. Indeed, 12 out
Figure 6. Expression of pSTAT1, CXCL9, CXCL10 in human atherosclerotic lesions in situ. Staining of the sections prepared from normal human artery
exhibited no presence of pSTAT1, CXCL9, CXCL10 (A, upper panel). In contrast, all three proteins could be detected in SM-M10 positive cells in
atherosclerotic plaques (A, middle panel) as well as in the endothelial cells at the lumen side (B). A representative analysis is shown of 6 human carotid
atherosclerotic lesions and 4 healthy controls. Arrows represent examples of positive staining. In B arrows with asterix indicate examples of positively

of the 30 genes were expressed in carotid plaques and 6 out of 30 in coronary
plaques, including CXCL9, CXCL10, CCL5, CCL8, CRCL2, Cd74, GBP5, UBD,
SECTM1, IFI16 (homologue Ifi-205), UPP1, FAM26F and the transcription factor
IRF8 as the above identified STAT1 targets (Fig. 7A).
Together, this points to a pro-atherogenic role of STAT1 in vascular cells of
atherosclerotic plaques, and suggests the potential of a selection of STAT1-target
genes as biomarkers to monitor plaque phenotype in human atherosclerosis.
Discussion
The involvement of STAT1 in experimental atherosclerosis has recently been
appreciated, especially in immune cells. It is additionally accepted that in immune
cells STAT1 is a unique point of convergence for the antimicrobial and
inflammatory synergism between IFNc and TLRs. Recently, we showed that also
in ECs cross-talk between IFNc and TLR4 resulted in augmented STAT1
phosphorylation and increased expression of the chemokine CXCL10 [17]. Here,
a similar STAT1-dependent mechanism for CXCL10 expression in response to
IFNc and LPS was observed in VSMCs at the RNA and protein level (Fig. 1). To
date, no information is available on the genome-wide induced changes modulated
by IFNc and TLR4 in ECs and VSMCs and how this affects vascular function.

Pro-Atherogenic Role of STAT1 in the Vasculature
PLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0113318 December 5, 2014 19 / 26

Therefore, we decided to further characterize the role of STAT1 in the
transcriptional response pathways involved in the interaction between IFNc and
TLR4 signaling in VSMCs. Thus, we identified a specific set of STAT1-dependent
genes that were synergistically affected by IFNc and LPS in VSMCs in vitro. These
included the chemokines Cxcl9, Ccl12, Ccl8, Ccl5, Cxcl10 and Ccrl2, adhesion
molecules (Cd40, Cd74), and the antiviral and antibacterial response genes Irf8,
Rsad2, Mx1, Oasl, Gbp5, Nos2, Batf2 and Tnfrsf11a. Based on their response
pattern to IFNc, LPS and IFNc+LPS in WT-VSMCs (Fig. 2B), we could
distinguish five clusters of genes (Fig. 2C). In general, the absence of STAT1
severely abrogated the IFNc-induced expression of all of these genes. Moreover,
the LPS response of 50% of genes listed in Table 1 was decreased in the absence of
STAT1. Consequently, the synergistic effect of IFNc and LPS, as seen in WT￾VSMCs, could no longer be detected in STAT12/2-VSMCs. This strongly suggests
the involvement of STAT1 in the signal integration between JAK/STAT and TLR4
pathways. The IFNc-induced expression of Ccl8 appeared STAT1-independent,
with a similar fold induction in WT and STAT12/2 VSMCs. In contrast, absence
of STAT1 increased its response to LPS. As Ccl8 is a known STAT3 target gene
[37], it is possible that it’s IFNc and LPS inducibility in WT and STAT12/2
VSMCs, is regulated by this transcription factor. The increased LPS-mediated Ccl8
expression in STAT12/2 VSMCs as compared to WT cells, could potentially be
explained by the absence of a STAT1-dependent inhibitory mechanism of STAT3
activity mediated by the STAT1-target gene SOCS1.
The expression of a selection of these genes, including Ccl5, Cxcl9, Nos2, Irf8
and Ccl12, Ccrl2 (not shown) was additionally determined at the RNA and protein
level, and confirmed the microarray data. Moreover, relative quantification as fold
change compared to control, resulted in a similar range of induction values for
RNA and protein expression. A similar expression pattern of some of these genes
could also be identified in ECs and aortic ring segments, providing evidence for a
universal STAT1-dependent mechanism in vascular cells triggered by IFNc and
LPS.
Integration of IFNc and TLR signaling pathways occurs, for instance, through
synergy between TLR- and IFNc-induced transcription factors. Promoter analysis
of the genes listed in Table 1 indeed predicted the presence of STAT-NFkB and
IRF-NFkB modules or combinations of separate ISRE, STAT or NFkB binding
sites in their promoters. Indeed, ChIP-qPCR confirmed binding of STAT1, NFkB
and IRF1 to the Cxcl10 gene, in an IFNc and LPS-dependent manner (Figure 3E).
This strongly suggested that cooperation between NFkB, STAT1 and/or IRFs is
involved in the transcriptional regulation of all of these genes in response to IFNc
and LPS. According to previous studies, transcription of genes that contain
STAT1- and NFkB-binding sites in their promoter regions are often cooperatively
regulated by extracellular stimuli that induce STAT1 and NFkB, such as IFNc and
TNFa, IL-1b or LPS [38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43]. Likewise, genes with both an ISRE
element and NFkB-binding site are subjected to a similar mechanism of signal
integration [44, 45]. In general it is believed that in immune cells, multiple
inflammatory stimuli culminate in gene expression that requires cooperation

between NFkB and STAT1 or NFkB and IRF1 [7]. They ultimately promote type I
immune actions, which are associated with host-defense mechanisms against viral
and bacterial infections and excessive immune responses [46]. Our data provides
strong evidence that a similar mechanism of signal integration exists in vascular
cells. The difference in expression pattern of these 30 genes did not correlate with
the presence of a specific binding site or combination of binding sites. This
implies that the affinity of the different transcription factors is most likely
determining the transcriptional response of a particular gene.
Among the amplified genes we also identified the transcription factor IRF8,
which expression is thought to be restricted to lymphoid-cell lineages such as B-,
T- and macrophages. Thus, IRF8 may in part account for ‘‘immune cell-specific’’
STAT1-dependent functions of IFNc. IRF8 is also directly connected to TLR
action, regulating the production of type I IFNs and other inflammatory
mediators. For example, co-administration of IFNc and LPS to macrophages
caused super-induction of IRF8 and IRF8 target genes [47]. As a consequence,
synergistic induction of the pro-inflammatory genes IL1, IL6, IL12 and TNFa was
observed in an IRF8 dependent manner. In addition to its known immune cell
functions, our results now uncover a novel ‘‘inflammation-dependent’’ role of
IRF8 in cells from the vasculature. In ECs as well as VSMCs, combined treatment
of IFNc and LPS resulted in a synergistic increase in IRF8 gene and protein
expression as compared to both factors alone (Figure 4A and B). The presence of a
potential STAT1-NFkB module in the IRF8 promoter (Table 1) highly suggests
that the cooperation of these two transcription factors is at the basis of its
synergistic expression. Consequently, this revealed the possible existence of IRF8-
dependent cross-talk between IFNc and LPS in vascular cells. Indeed, we
subsequently identified Ccl5 (but not Cxcl9 and Cxcl10) as a novel IRF8 target in
VSMCs and ECs (Fig. 4C and D). The transcriptional regulation of the Ccl5 gene
in macrophages in response to IFNc and LPS, was recently shown to involve IRF8
in combination with IRF1 and NFkB [34]. Therefore, the IRF8-dependent
expression of Ccl5 in IFNc-primed vascular cells that are subsequently stimulated
by LPS is likely to comprise a similar mechanism. These results correlates with the
predicted presence of an IRF-NFkB module in the Ccl5 promoter (Table 1). On
the other hand, the same promoter contains also a potential STAT1-NFkB
module (Table 1) which suggests the additional involvement of STAT1 as well.
Together, our detailed investigation of STAT1-dependent transcriptional
synergism between IFNc and LPS in cells from the vasculature predicts the
existence of different regulatory mechanisms. It particularly involves cooperation
between STAT1, IRF1, IRF8 and NFkB, with the novel role of IRF8 providing an
additional layer to the overall complexity.
Functional analysis of the STAT1-dependent genes that were synergistically
affected by interactions between IFNc and LPS in VSMCs (Table 1), revealed
significant enrichment in biological functions connected to host defense, immune
response, inflammatory response, cytokine response, response to stress and to
wound healing (Table 2). All these categories generally represent a similar group
Pro-Atherogenic Role of STAT1 in the Vasculature

of genes, which together reflect an enhanced pro-inflammatory and pro￾atherogenic profile.
The fact that synergistic interactions between IFNc and LPS in VSMCs resulted
in increased expression of multiple chemokines, prompted us to investigate T-cell
migration. Indeed, a significant increase in migration of CD3+
/CD45+ splenocytes
could be detected towards conditioned medium from IFNc and LPS treated WT￾VSMCs as compared to that from cells treated with single factors. Importantly,
splenocytes migration occurred in a STAT1-dependent manner, which correlated
with decreased chemokine expression in STAT12/2-VSMCs under these
conditions (Fig. 4E). Interestingly a subset of these chemokines, including CXCL9,
CXCL10, CCL5, CCL8 and CCRL2, has been reported to be increased in cells from
the vasculature, which is in agreement with our results. Moreover, evidence exists
that chemokines cooperate in leukocyte recruitment to the injured artery during
vascular remodeling [35, 48, 49] and as such are involved in the pathogenesis of
atherosclerosis.
To further elucidate the functional role of a cross-talk in the vessel, we
performed contractility studies. The signal integration between IFNc and LPS in
aortic ring segments resulted in impaired aortic contractility (Fig. 5) and
coincided with a dramatic increase in expression of Nos2. Nos2 participates in
vascular dysfunction and is associated with progression of atherosclerosis [50, 51].
More important, we were able to detect phosphorylated STAT1 in VSMCs and
ECs of human atherosclerotic plaques (Fig. 6), which correlated with elevated
expression of the chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10. Recently, Agrawal et al. [10]
showed that STAT1 deficiency reduced foam cell formation in an intraperitoneal
inflammation model and reduced atherosclerosis in an atherosclerosis-susceptible
bone marrow transplantation mouse model. In combination with our results, this
highlights the pro-atherogenic role of STAT1 in cells from the vasculature in
human vascular disease.
Using data mining of human plaque transcriptomes, we were able to show that
expression of a selection of the above identified STAT1-dependent pro￾atherogenic genes was significantly increased in human plaques from carotid and
coronary arteries (Fig. 7A). Of these, CXCL9, CXCL10, CCL5, CCL8, CRCL2,
Cd74 and IRF8 have previously been implicated in atherosclerosis [52, 53]. This is
not the case for GBP5, Ubd, SectM1, Ifi16, Upp1 and Fam26F, and could therefore
represent potential novel biomarkers of atherosclerosis. Moreover, CCL5
expression was higher in carotid (23.3 fold increase) as compared to coronary (2.9
fold increase) plaques, which correlated with IRF8 levels (8.8 fold increase in
carotid vs. 1.4 fold increase in coronary). Detailed promoter analysis of
differentially expressed genes in coronary and carotid plaques predicted
cooperative involvement of NFkB, STAT1 and/or IRF1 in regulation of their
expression. This could point to the role of IFNc and TLR4 activation in human
atherosclerosis, which is in agreement with previous studies [6, 54, 55]. However,
we cannot rule out the contribution of other pro-inflammatory stimuli in the
regulation of these genes. Nevertheless, our data strongly suggest involvement of
Pro-Atherogenic Role of STAT1 in the Vasculature

both STAT1 and IRF8 in the regulation of gene expression in different cell types
present in human atherosclerotic plaques.
In summary, our findings provide additional evidence to suggest that in ECs
and VSMCs STAT1, in cooperation with IRF1, IRF8 and NFkB, coordinates a
platform for cross-talk between IFNc and TLR4. This results in an increased pro￾inflammatory phenotype and leads to amplified pro-atherogenic responses in the
vasculature. As a consequence, in the presence of IFNc and LPS (or any other
exogenous or endogenous TLR4 ligands), multiple chemokines, adhesion
molecules and antiviral and antibacterial response proteins can be over-produced
in ECs and VSMCs. This may in turn modulate leukocyte attraction, adhesion and
VSMC proliferation and migration, which are important characteristics of
vascular dysfunction and early triggers of atherosclerosis. As such, a predefined
STAT1-target gene signature could be developed as a novel diagnostic tool to
monitor and diagnose plaque phenotype in human atherosclerosis. In addition,
STAT1 represents an interesting novel target of therapeutic intervention that has a
crucial role in mediating the interplay between damaged vessels and host
immunity during the process of atherosclerosis.
