Abstract
The intraerythrocytic parasite Plasmodium—the causative agent of malaria—produces an inorganic crystal called hemozoin
(Hz) during the heme detoxification process, which is released into the circulation during erythrocyte lysis. Hz is rapidly
ingested by phagocytes and induces the production of several pro-inflammatory mediators such as interleukin-1b (IL-1b).
However, the mechanism regulating Hz recognition and IL-1b maturation has not been identified. Here, we show that Hz
induces IL-1b production. Using knockout mice, we showed that Hz-induced IL-1b and inflammation are dependent on
NOD-like receptor containing pyrin domain 3 (NLRP3), ASC and caspase-1, but not NLRC4 (NLR containing CARD domain).
Furthermore, the absence of NLRP3 or IL-1b augmented survival to malaria caused by P. chabaudi adami DS. Although much
has been discovered regarding the NLRP3 inflammasome induction, the mechanism whereby this intracellular
multimolecular complex is activated remains unclear. We further demonstrate, using pharmacological and genetic
intervention, that the tyrosine kinases Syk and Lyn play a critical role in activation of this inflammasome. These findings not
only identify one way by which the immune system is alerted to malarial infection but also are one of the first to suggest a
role for tyrosine kinase signaling pathways in regulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome.

Introduction
Malaria is a widespread infectious disease that affect up to 300
million individuals in the tropical and sub-tropical regions of the
world, and is responsible for 2–3 million deaths annually [1]. Malaria
is caused by parasites of the Plasmodium genus and is characterized by
episodic fevers, anemia, headache and organ failure. Plasmodium
parasites feed on erythrocyte hemoglobin and uses a heme
detoxification mechanism that results in the formation of an insoluble,
inert, dark-brown crystalline metabolic waste called hemozoin (Hz)
[1,2]. Hz is involved in the fever observed during the malaria process
as intravenous injection of Hz caused thermal deregulation and was
associated with the induction of pyrogenic cytokines [3]. In addition,
the release of both Plasmodium-derived Hz and merozoites during the
erythrocyte burst phase of the disease coincides with the massive
induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1b and TNF,
and with the periodic fevers characteristic of malaria [3,4].
IL-1b secretion is controlled by the recently described inflamma￾some, a signaling platform scaffold composed of NLR family
members such as NLRC4 (NOD-like receptor containing CARD
domain or IPAF) and members of the NLRP (NOD-like receptor
containing pyrin domain) family including NLRP1 and NLRP3 (also
known as NALP3 and cryopyrin). In addition, the NLRP3
inflammasome is composed of the adaptor molecule ASC (Apopto￾sis-Associated Speck-Like Protein) and the effector molecule caspase￾1, the latter which is responsible for the cleavage of pro-IL-1b into its
active form [5,6]. TNF is induced by a wide variety of innate receptors
but in particular by many members of the Toll-like receptors (TLR). It
was previously reported that Hz can induce IL-1b secretion in vitro and
in vivo [7,8], however, TLRs are not required for the Hz-induced
inflammatory response [9]. Given the clear association of IL-1b with
the induction of fever and recent studies demonstrating that the
NLRP3 inflammasome senses inorganic materials, such as mono￾sodium urate (MSU, a gout-associated uric-acid crystals), silica,
asbestos and aluminum hydroxide by producing IL-1b [6], we tested
whether Hz can activate the NLRP3 inflammasome.
In addition, while NLRP3 ligands have been well identified,
little is known about the upstream mechanisms that regulate its

activation. Some mechanisms that have been proposed include
efflux of potassium, increased intracellular calcium, reactive
oxygen species (ROS) generation and lysosome disruption
[6,10]. However, having previously reported that both MSU
and Hz can trigger production of inflammatory mediators via the
activation of signaling cascades involving MAP kinase family
members and various transcription factors, we have herein
addressed the role of upstream signaling in the activation of the
inflammasome that results in IL-1b production in response to the
malarial pigment Hz.
Results
Hz-induced IL-1b and neutrophil recruitment is mediated
by NLRP3, ASC and caspase-1, but not NLRC4
In these studies we utilized a chemically synthesized Hz to
prevent contamination that could result from native Hz purifica￾tion; the synthetic Hz is morphologically and chemically similar to
native Plasmodium-isolated Hz (Fig. S1). Previously, we reported
that both synthetic and native Hz induce similar expression
profiles of chemokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines [7]. In
addition, the synthetic Hz was subjected to elemental analysis to
assess its purity. Theoretical calculated values of the molecular
formula of Hz (C68H62N8O8Fe2) give 66.35% of carbon (C),
5.08% of hydrogen (H) and 9.10% of nitrogen (N). We have
obtained elemental values from our synthetic Hz preparation very
close with the theoretical one (C: 66.5%; H: 5.3%; N: 8.9%). To
further show the purity of Hz, we performed an agarose gel with
200 mg of Hz and we did not detect any trace DNA or RNA
contamination (Fig. S2A) and treatment with DNase or RNase did
not interfere with Hz-induced IL-1b production (Fig. S2B). These
data indicate that our synthetic Hz preparation is high purity and
free of contaminant.
To evaluate whether Hz activates the inflammasome, we
measured IL-1b secretion by PMA-differentiated human mono￾cytic cell line (THP-1) stimulated with increasing concentrations of
Hz or MSU. Hz- and MSU-induced IL-1b production was found
to be comparable (Fig. 1A). In accordance with previous studies
showing that HSP-90 stability [11] modulates inflammasome
assembly, we found that Hz-induced IL-1b secretion was reduced
in the presence of the HSP-90 inhibitor geldanamycin D (Fig. 1B).
Inhibition of caspase-1 activity using a specific competitor (Y￾VAD-FMK) [12] or a broad caspase inhibitor (Z-VAD-CHO) also
blocked Hz-induced IL-1b (Fig. 1C). To confirm the activation of
caspase-1 we used the bone-marrow-derived macrophages
(BMDM), since detection of the active form of caspase-1 in
THP-1 cells is difficult as reported by others [13,14]. Here, we
show that Hz induced cleavage of caspase-1 to its enzymatically
active (p10 subunit) form. BMDM were pre-stimulated with LPS
in order to prime the induction of pro-IL-1b. As shown in
Figure 1D, Hz and MSU, but not the pre-treatment with LPS,
induced cleavage of caspase-1 and mature IL-1b production,
which was completely abolished in BMDM from caspase-1
deficient mice.
These results suggest a role for the inflammasome in Hz￾induced IL-1b production. To further establish which intracellular
receptors and/or adaptor proteins are activated by Hz, we used
BMDM from mice deficient in NLRP3, ASC or another NLR,
NLRC4 (NLR containing CARD domain, also known as IPAF).
We found that Hz- and MSU-induced caspase-1 activation and
IL-1b maturation were dependent on NLRP3 and ASC but not
NLRC4 (Fig. 2A). On the other hand, macrophages from NLRC4
mice failed to respond to Salmonella typhimurium infection (Fig. S3).
To evaluate whether activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome is
involved in Hz-induced inflammatory responses in vivo, mice were
injected intraperitoneally with Hz and then neutrophil recruitment
to the site of injection was examined. Hz induced significant
recruitment of neutrophils to the peritoneal cavity in wild type, but
not in ASC-deficient (Fig. 2B) or in NLRP3-deficient mice
(Fig. 2C). As expected, NLRC4 was not involved in the
inflammatory response induced by Hz (Fig. 2C). We further
investigated whether IL-1b directly contributed to the recruitment
of neutrophils. As expected, IL-1b deficient mice showed a
significant decrease in the number of neutrophils elicited by Hz
stimulation (Fig. 2D). However, we did not observe a complete
abrogation of neutrophil influx as previously seen with IL-1
receptor-deficient mice stimulated with other inflammasome
ligands [15]. These results suggest that a portion of the Hz￾induced inflammatory response in vivo may results from other
ligands of the IL-1 receptors and/or other cytokines and
chemokines known to be induced by Hz [3,7,8].
NLRP3 and IL-1b-deficient mice show increased survival
and lower body temperature when infected with the
malarial parasite Plasmodium chabaudi adami DS
Thus far, we have shown that Hz-induced IL-1b production is
dependent on the NLRP3 inflammasome, in addition, it is known
that IL-1b is involved in malarial fever [4]. To evaluate the role
of IL-1b and the NLRP3 inflammasome during malarial disease
we infected IL-1b- and NLRP3-deficient mice with Plasmodium
chabaudi adami DS, which is a mouse virulent strain. Of interest,
both IL-1b- and NLRP3 mice presented a slight but significant
lower body temperature (Fig. 3A and 3B) and parasitemia
(Fig. 3C and 3D) in the early phase of infection. These knockout
mice also showed a significantly prolonged survival compared
with wild type mice, but ultimately succumbed to the infection
(Fig. 3E and 3F). Finally, in the late phase of infection, the level of
IL-1b was significantly lower in NLRP3-deficient mouse in
comparison with wild type mice (Fig. 3G) and was not detectable
in IL-1b-deficient mouse (data not shown). These results indicate
that IL-1b is an important factor in the pathophysiology during
malaria infection.
Author Summary
Malaria is widespread in the tropical and sub-tropical
regions of the world, and is responsible for 2–3 million
deaths annually. This disease is caused by parasites of the
Plasmodium genus. The parasite feeds on the hemoglobin
of red blood cells and generates a metabolic waste called
hemozoin (Hz). Hz is released into the blood circulation
during the rupture of red blood cells, which coincides with
the production of many cytokines such as interleukin-1b
(IL-1b), responsible in part for the periodic fever that is
characteristic of the malaria disease. Here, we investigated
how Hz activates macrophages (cells that engulf foreign
material) to produce IL-1b. We found that Hz is taken up
by macrophages initiating signals such as the tyrosine
kinases Syk and Lyn that communicate to intracellular
receptors. We also showed that Hz-induced IL-1b produc￾tion is dependent on activation of the intracellular
receptor NLRP3, the adaptor protein ASC and a protease
called caspase-1 that cleaves IL-1b, therefore allowing it to
be released from the cells. These findings not only identify
one way in which the immune system is alerted to malarial
infection but also dissect some of the signaling events
triggered by Hz in the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway.

Hz-induced IL-1b requires phagocytosis, ROS generation,
potassium efflux and cathepsin B activation without
phagosome damage
Hz is rapidly engulfed by phagocytes, both in infectious and
experimental conditions [2]. Therefore, to test the importance of
phagocytosis on Hz-induced IL-1b production, cells were treated
with cytochalasin D - a powerful actin polymerization inhibitor -
prior to the addition of the crystals. Consistent with other crystals
that induce inflammasome activation [15,16,17], we found that
Hz-induced IL-1b seems to be dependent on its internalization
(Fig. 4A). Furthermore, under certain conditions phagocytosis
requires cholesterol-rich lipid domains [18] and as expected,
cholesterol depletion by MbCD inhibited HZ-induced IL-1b (Fig.
S5A), which was due to the disruption of lipid rafts (Fig. S5C).
Further characterization of Hz phagocytosis by confocal immu￾nofluorescence microscopy revealed that Hz was internalized in a
vacuole that acquired lysosomal features, as shown by the
presence of Lamp-1 surrounding the engulfed Hz phagosomes
(Fig. 4B). Phagocytosis is generally accompanied by the
generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which modulates
inflammasome activation by crystals such as silica [19], MSU [15]
and asbestos [20]. Since Hz induces ROS production [7] its
requirement in Hz-induced IL-1b production was evaluated. The
ROS scavenger, N-acetylcysteine (NAC) inhibited both Hz- and
MSU-induced IL-1b production (Fig. 4C), which suggests a
potential upstream role for ROS in inflammasome activation
by Hz. Cellular potassium efflux is another critical step in
inflammasome activation induced by all known NLRP3 activators
[21,22]. As shown in the Figure 4D, inhibition of potassium efflux
by high concentrations of extracellular potassium decreased IL-1b
production induced by Hz. The above results suggest that Hz
shares a common mechanistic pathway in the activation of the
NRLP3 inflammasome with classical triggers such as ATP and
others insoluble crystals [21,23].
Recently, lysosomal destabilization has been proposed as one
mechanism whereby inorganic materials such as silica and
aluminum hydroxide activate the inflammasome [17]. To assess
lysosomal morphology in the context of Hz stimulation, we

performed a confocal analysis of PMA-matured THP-1 cells
loaded with a self-quenched conjugate of ovalbumin (DQ-OVA)
that fluoresces only upon proteolytic degradation. We found that
Hz did not affect the shape of lysosomes in comparison to
untreated cells. In contrast, silica-treated cells contained swollen
lysosomes (Fig. 4E), suggesting that Hz may activate the
inflammasome through distinct, but related pathway. Indeed,
inhibition of the lysosomal cysteine protease (cathepsin B) by the
specific inhibitor CA-074 abrogated IL-1b induced by Hz and
silica (Fig. 4F) [17]. However, it is still unclear how this enzyme is
involved in inflammasome activation and indeed, many of the
proximal signaling events in NLRP3 and NLR activation remain
unknown.
Hz-induced upstream signaling regulates IL-1b production
Whereas we obtained clear evidence that Hz can induce IL-1b
production in an inflammasome-dependent manner that required
active cathepsin B, we did not find evidence of Hz-induced
lysosomal rupture as previously reported with silica [17]. Release
of cathepsin B without lysosomal rupture has been observed in
monocytes treated with the potassium ionophore nigericin [24]. In
addition, the widely expressed Spleen Tyrosine Kinase (Syk) was
shown to be required for cathepsin B release into the cytosol in a
model of B cell receptor-mediated apoptosis [25]. We therefore
screened Hz-activated macrophages for changes in their tyrosine
phosphorylation profiles. Consistent with the possible involvement
of Syk, we observed a band with an apparent molecular weight of

72 kDa that was phosphorylated in response to Hz, but not MSU
(Fig. 5A). We then carried out anti-Syk immunoprecipitation,
followed by anti phospho-tyrosine analysis and found that Syk was
phosphorylated in response to Hz, but not MSU stimulation
(Fig. 5B). Even by extending the time-course of stimulation, MSU
did not induce Syk phosphorylation (Fig S4A).

(ITAMs) or ITAM-like domains phosphorylated by Scr family
kinases following receptor clustering [26,27]. The Src kinase
inhibitor PP2 decreased the Hz-induced Syk phosphorylation in a
dose dependent manner (Fig. 5C). Syk activation can be mediated
by the Scr family kinase member Lyn [28]. Lyn is typically found
in lipid raft signaling platforms and disruption of these rafts by
MbCD (Fig. S5C) indeed blocked, in dose-dependent manner, Syk
phosphorylation in Hz-stimulated monocytes (Fig. S5B). Using
BMDM from Lyn-deficient mice, we found that Hz-induced Syk
phosphorylation required Lyn, and further confirmed that MSU
does not utilize this signaling pathway in either murine or human
macrophages (Fig. 5).
Next we evaluated the role of Lyn and Syk in Hz-induced IL-1b
production. IL-1b secretion stimulated by Hz was inhibited in
macrophages treated with the Syk inhibitor piceatannol (Fig. 6A),
the Scr kinase inhibitor PP2 (Fig. 6B), and more specifically using
Lyn-deficient BMDM (Fig. 6C). Importantly, in this last
experiment, Hz-induced IL-1b production was only partially
inhibited, which suggest that another member of the Src kinase
family could play the same role of Lyn, since these kinases are
known to be functionally redundant [28]. Of note, MSU-induced
IL-1b production was not affected in Lyn-deficient BMDM pre￾treated with LPS. To evaluate the relative roles of LPS and Hz in
the induction of this signaling pathway, we treated BMDM with
LPS and we observed that LPS by itself did not induce phospho￾Syk, and indeed pre-treatment with LPS reduced Hz-induced Syk
phosphorylation (Fig. S4B). Furthermore, Hz-induced Syk activa￾tion is not affected by the absence of the MyD88 adaptor protein
(Fig. S4C). However, MyD88-deficient cells show a delay in the
phosphorylation of c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) stimulated by
LPS (Fig. S4C), similar as previously reported [29]. These results
rule out a possible effect of LPS on Syk phosphorylation.
Consistent with the involvement of this kinase in a pathway
upstream of the inflammasome, NLRP3-, ASC- and NLRC4-
deficient macrophages exhibited normal Syk phosphorylation
upon Hz stimulation (Fig. 6D).
Syk activates various downstream signaling pathways, including
phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) [30] and extracellular signal￾regulated kinase (ERK). To test whether the PI3K pathway is
required for propagation of the Syk signaling pathway following

Hz exposure, the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin was used prior to Hz
stimulation. Inhibition of PI3K indeed abrogated IL-1b matura￾tion (Fig. 7A). We have previously identified MAPK activation
upon Hz stimulation of macrophages [31]. We therefore
attempted to isolate which pathways might be required for Hz￾induced IL-1b production using known p38 and ERK kinase
inhibitors. Whereas p38 phosphorylation can be observed
following Hz stimulation, inhibition of p38 with SB203580 failed
to block Hz-induced IL-1b production (Fig. 7B–D). On the other
hand, inhibition of ERK with Apigenin abrogated Hz-induced IL￾1b secretion (Fig. 7E). Altogether, these results reveal that Lyn/
Syk activation following Hz exposure initiates the PI3K and ERK
signaling pathways and these pathways appear to regulate the
production of mature IL-1b.
While a number of stimuli are known to activate the NLRP3
inflammasome, there is no evidence that NLRP3 directly recognizes
these ligands. Therefore an indirect pathway of NLRP3 activation is
likely, however the identity of the direct molecular switch of NLRP3
has not been identified. Our studies provide the first evidence for a
role of tyrosine kinase signaling molecules in NLRP3 activation. To
examine whether Syk can modulate the inflammasome by directly
interacting with its components, we immunoprecipitated Syk and
then immunoblotted for potential partners associated with Syk by
silver staining and western blotting (Fig. 8A). Selected differential
bands were analyzed by LC-tandem mass spectrometry. Interest￾ingly, two to three different peptides covering 11–23% of the Pyrin
domain (Pyd) [32] were identified. Pyrin domains are known to
mediate protein-protein interactions and are crucial in many of the
NLR inflammasome complexes, and in particular, mediate the
NLRP3 and ASC interaction [6]. We therefore confirmed by
western blotting whether NLRP3 or ASC can be co-immunopre￾cipitated (co-IP) with Syk. Whereas NLRP3 was shown to weakly

interact with Syk, ASC was found to strongly associate with this
kinase upon Hz stimulation (Fig. 8B). These findings suggest that
Syk, and possibly other unidentified signaling kinases, can
associated with the ASC/NRLP3 inflammasome.
Another possible mechanism is that Syk could be controlling the
NLRP3 inflammasome by regulating cathepsin B activation. First,
we tested if Hz can induce release of the active form of cathepsin B
in the supernatant and as showed in the Figure 9A, Hz did not
induce cathepsin B release into supernatant as has been observed
with MSU and silica. However, using a cathepsin B substrate that
emits red fluorescence upon cleavage we demonstrated that Hz
induces rapid (30 min) and transient (maximum 1.5 h) intra￾compartmental cathepsin B activation that was dependent on Syk
activation (Fig. 9B). These results indicate that Syk not only can
associate with the inflammasome component but it can also
modulate cathepsin B activation.
Discussion
It has been described that NLRP3 senses many crystalline
materials that are involved in inflammatory diseases, such as MSU
[15], silica [19], and asbestos [20]. Here we provide the first
demonstration that the malaria pigment hemozoin (Hz) can also
activate the NLRP3 inflammasome. Importantly, the Hz concen￾tration shown to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome in vitro is
similar in range to the concentration of Hz in the blood of patients
with moderate parasitemia [8,33]. Moreover, it was never shown
in the previous studies that direct contact between a crystal and
NLRP3 is necessary to induce activation. Similarly, we found that
Hz does not translocate from the phagosome/lysosome compart￾ment to the cytoplasm, as it is located within LAMP-1-positive
compartments, suggesting that Hz activated the NLRP3 inflam￾masome in an indirect manner.
It has been proposed that the NLRP3 inflammasome senses not
only pathogen-associated molecular patterns but also danger signals
such as stress-related molecules [5]. In agreement, here we show
that Hz-induced IL-1b production was dependent on ROS
generation and potassium efflux into the cytoplasm. In addition to
previous studies on the inflammasome, we further identified an
upstream signaling pathway involving the Src kinase Lyn, the
tyrosine kinase Syk and Syk-downstream kinases such as PI3K and
ERK that collectively appear to be involved in the regulation of Hz￾induced IL-1b production. Simultaneously to us, it has been
recently reported that Syk kinase is involved in upstream signaling of
NLR inflammasome triggered by fungi [34]. Whether these findings
represent a general regulatory mechanism of this intracellular innate
immune response will need further investigation.
The Lyn/Syk pathway appears to be uniquely activated in the
innate response to Hz crystals, as opposed to other NLRP3-
activating crystals such as MSU. In our hands, MSU did not induce
Syk or Lyn phosphorylation in PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells nor
in BMDM. However, MSU was previously reported to trigger Syk
phosphorylation in dendritic cells [35] and human neutrophils [36],
as well as Lyn phosphorylation in neutrophils [37].
An intriguing question is how this signaling cascade may
modulate the inflammasome/IL-1b production. For instance, we
found some indication that Syk can interact with ASC, but not
NLRP3. ASC, as it is well known, interacts with NLRP3. These
results suggest that Syk may modify ASC. In support of this finding,
there is evidence that the ASC pyrin domain can be phosphorylated
Figure 7. The role of other kinases in hemozoin-induced IL-1b. PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells (0.756106 cells/0.5 mL) were pretreated with:
(A) PI3K inhibitor – wortmannin, (B and D) p38 inhibitor - SB 203580, or (E) ERK inhibitor - apigenin followed by Hz (200 mg/mL) stimulation for six
hours (IL-1b) or 30 minutes (pp38) or the indicated time (C). Supernatant (SN) and cell lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis with the
indicated antibodies. Data show one experiment representative of two to five independent experiments.

[38]. Moreover, hyperphosphorylated PSTPIP1 (proline serine
threonine phosphatase-interacting protein) was shown to interact
with the pyrin protein [39], resulting in its conformational change
and further its interaction with ASC [40]. Another possible
mechanism whereby kinases can modulate IL-1b production is by
modulating intracellular calcium concentration or cathepsin B
activation. Syk is involved in the activation of intracellular calcium
mobilization in other models [41]. In fact, increased calcium
concentrations have been found to modulate inflammasome
activation by different stimuli such as MSU and UV radiation
[22,42]. Finally, Syk was found to control the activation of cathepsin
B and Hz-induced IL-1b production was dependent on cathepsin B
activation, similar to other inflammasome activators such as silica,
MSU [17] or nigericin [24]. We showed that specific inhibition of
Syk blocked the Hz-induced cathepsin B activation. Collectively, it
is clear that different steps in the Hz-induced IL-1b production can
be regulated by intracellular signaling. However, further study will
be necessary to better characterize these regulatory events in regards
to the different inorganic crystals that can trigger NLRP3
inflammasome activation.
Another interesting observation is that Hz-activated cathepsin B
occurred in the intracellular compartment and is rapidly quenched
(1–3 hours), suggesting either a transient activation or cathepsin B
release into the cytosol. The idea of transient activation of
cathepsin B by Hz is supported by the absence of cathepsin B in
the supernatant of cells stimulated with Hz and the absence of
lysosomal damage upon Hz treatment. The mechanism utilized by
Hz-activated cathepsin B to modulate the inflammasome remains
unclear. However, a possible mechanism is that cathepsin B can
activate directly caspase-1 as it has been shown in previous works
[17,24]. Of interest, both caspase-1 and cathepsin B, in addition to
inflammasome components and IL-1b are found in multivesicular
bodies surrounded by LAMP-1 [43]. It is known that Syk and Syk￾activated downstream kinases such as PI3K regulate the trafficking
of intracellular vesicles [44]. In this way, Hz-induced Syk might be
controlling not only the inflammasome cascade but also the
trafficking of multivesicles.
The Lyn/Syk activation finding raises the intriguing possibility
that an as yet unidentified receptor or adaptor protein containing
an ITAM or ITAM-like domain, such as Dectin-1, TREM family
members, Siglec or DAP12 [26,27], might be activated upon Hz
stimulation to trigger the signaling cascade involved in inflamma￾some activation. However, a recent work with dendritic cells
demonstrated that MSU did not require a surface receptor -
instead the crystals interact with surface lipid rafts and this was
enough to trigger Syk/PI3K pathway [35]. In our study, we have
demonstrated that lipid rafts are involved in the Hz-induced
signaling pathway and IL-1b production. Other potential
receptors that could mediate Hz-triggered signaling are the Toll￾like receptors (TLR). However, we have recently demonstrated in
collaboration with Parroche and colleagues [9] that Hz alone fails
to activate TLRs except when Hz is coated with parasitic DNA
Figure 8. Syk complexes with inflammasome proteins. PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells (106106 cells per immunoprecipitation - IP) were
stimulated with Hz (200 mg/mL) for the indicated time. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with a specific antibody to SYK or matched isotype control
and samples were subjected to (A left panel) silver staining or (A right panel) to Western blot analysis to phosphorylated tyrosine residues (pY).

and consequently activating TLR9. Similarly, we also observed
that HEK293 cells transfected with different TLRs were not
activated by Hz although these cells were able to induce NF-kB
activation following specific ligand stimulations (Jaramillo and
Olivier, unpublished data). We also showed that the MyD88
signaling pathway is not involved in the Hz-induced Syk
phosphorylation. Experiments to identify surface receptors or
lipids that recognize Hz are currently underway.
In the present work we further supported the role of NLRP3-
mediated IL-1b production in Hz-mediated inflammatory cell
recruitment using IL-1b deficient mice. Apart from its inflammatory
role, IL-1b is a pyrogenic cytokine that in small concentrations
induces the production of other cytokines such as IL-6 and can
cause hypertension and fever [45]. In fact, we showed that NLRP3-
and IL-1b-deficient mice exhibited lower body temperature during
the early phase of P. chabaudi Adami infection. Hz-induced IL-1b can
be the mediator of the up-regulation of chemokines and cytokines
during malaria infection, which is independent of TLRs but
dependent on MyD88 [46]. This suggests that another MyD88
dependent receptor such as IL-1R is involved and supports a role for
IL-1b in malaria-related pathology. Corroborating this hypothesis,
we showed that IL-1b- and NLRP3- deficient mice showed a better
survival than wild type mice in murine experimental model of
malaria. Not surprisingly, it was not sufficient to provide full
protection likely due to the complexity of malarial disease, which is
under the regulation of many different receptors, cytokines,
signaling events and physiological features.
Collectively, our study provides the first demonstration that a
malarial-derived metabolic product, namely hemozoin, can induce
NLRP3 inflammasome activation and IL-1b production though the
involvement of the Src kinase Lyn and the tyrosine kinase Syk.
However, excessive IL-1b secretion can be deleterious to the host; in
fact, we observed that higher production of IL-1b correlates with
early death in murine experimental malaria. Therefore these
findings strongly support the fact that Hz is critical in malaria
pathology. A better understanding of the molecular and cellular
events regulating malaria inflammatory-related pathologies may
provide new insights into the design of treatments aimed at reducing
the exaggerated inflammatory disorders and debilitating sequelae.

Native and synthetic hemozoin production
Native and Synthetic Hz have been obtained as previously
described [8,31]. We have modified synthetic Hz preparation,
using high purity chemical reagents (.99% of purity), as follows:
0.8 mmol Hemin was dissolved in degassed NaOH (0.1 M) for
30 minutes with mild stirring. pH 4.0 was adjusted adding drop￾wise propionic acid. The mixture was allowed to anneal at 70uC
for 18 hours. Then washed three times with NaHCO3 (0.1 M) for
three hours and the last wash with MeOH. All washes were
alternated with distilled H2O. Finally, the sample was then dried in
a vacuum oven overnight over phosphorous pentoxyde. All
synthetic hemozoin samples were analyzed by X-ray powder
diffraction, field emission gun scanning electron microscopy, and
infra-red spectroscopy to characterize the crystalline state of Hz.
Hz purity was assessed by elemental analysis [52].
THP-1 culture and stimulation
THP-1 cells (ATCC) were cultured with RPMI-1640 medium
supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% PSG, 50 mM of 2-b-mercap￾toetanol, Glucose 4.5 g/L and 1 mM sodium pyruvate. THP-1
differentiation: (1.56106 cells/mL) were incubated with 0.5 mM of
PMA, after three hours cells were washed and plated at 0.756106
cells/mL or 0.26106 cell/0.5 mL in 12 well plates (IL-1b) or 24
well plates containing coverslips (confocal) and incubated for 20–
24 hours. This treatment increases the phagocytic properties of the
cells and induces a constitutive production of pro-IL-1b. Prior to
stimulation, cells were washed and 500 mL of Alpha MEM
medium without FBS was replaced. Cells were pre-treated with
different drugs for 1 hour and stimulate with Hz, MSU or silica as
indicated in figure legends.
Mouse infection
Gender and age matched wild type (WT), NLRP3- or IL-1b￾deficient mice were injected i.p. with 56104 Plasmodium chabaudi
adami DS infected red blood cells obtained from syngeneic infected
mice. Parasitemia was assessed at day 5, 7 and then every day by
examination of Giemsa stained blood smears and was expressed as
mean parasitemia. Body temperature was measured using an
infrared thermometer (La Crosse Technology). Survival of mice
was monitored and blood serum was collected when the
temperature dropped down to 26uC. IL-1b was measured by
ELISA with rat monoclonal and goat anti-mouse IL-1b. The
detection limit was 6.25 pg/mL of IL-1b.
Bone-marrow derived macrophages (BMDM)
Bone marrow cells were obtained by flushing the femurs and
tibias from mice. Cells were used from fresh or from frozen
marrows. Erythrocytes were lysed with 2 mL of NH4Cl (155 mM)
in Tris/HCl (10 mM), pH 7.2 (9:1 solution)/mouse. Bone marrow
cells were adjusted to 76106 cells/10 mL and plated in 100 mm
dishes with RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 1% of PSG,
10% FBS and 30% (v/v) L929 cell culture supernatant. The
supernatants of bone marrow cells were changed every two days in
order to renew the cytokines and nutrients. After 7 days, the
culture dishes were washed with PBS and replaced by ice cold
PBS, incubated on ice for 15 min and cells were vigorously
detached. BMDM were adjusted to 1.56106
/2 mL or 0.26106
cells/0.5 mL in RPMI medium supplemented with 5% FBS
(Gibco) and 1% of PSG and plated in 6 well plates (IL-1b) or 24
wells plate (confocal). The next day, cells were washed with warm
PBS (37uC) and replaced by 500 mL of Alpha MEM medium
without FBS. Cells were, as indicated in figure legends, stimulated
with Hz, MSU or infected with Salmonella typhimurium as described
by Franchi et al. [53].
Supernatant and cell extract, immunoprecipitation (IP)
and SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting analysis
Supernatant and cell extract analysis: After designated incubation
time, supernatants were collected and protein was precipitated with
trichloroacetic acid at 10% final concentration. Precipitates were
then dissolved in Tris/HCl 0.1 mM pH 8.0 and Laemmli sample
load buffer. Cell extracts were obtained by lysing cells with Igepal
1% (for signaling, in 16PBS, 20% Glycerol, 16inhibitor protease
cocktail, 2 mM Na3VO4 and 1 mM NaF) or triton 1% (for caspase￾1, in TNE buffer: 10 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM
EDTA and 1.56 inhibitor protease cocktail). Whole supernatant
protein and equal amount of protein or cell lysate were subjected to
SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis.
IP: Cells lysates were extracted with lysis buffer (1% CHAPs
detergent in TNE buffer, 16 inhibitor cocktail, 2 mM Na3VO4
and 1 mM NaF). Cells lysates were pre-incubated for two hours at
4uC with protein A/G-coupled agarose beads and 1 mg of
unspecific matched isotype control antibody (Ab). Equal amount
of protein were immunoprecipitated with protein A/G-coupled
agarose beads or True Blot anti-rabbit Ig and 2 mg of specific or
unspecific matched isotype control Ab overnight. Beads were spun
down 3 times with lysis buffer and proteins were denatured in
Laemmli load buffer.
SDS-PAGE/Immunoblot: Samples from supernatants, cell
extracts or IP were subjected to 10% (signaling) or 15% (IL-1b
and caspase-1) acrylamide gel (all reagents from Laboratoire Mat.
Inc., Montreal, Qc, Canada) or 4–12% NuPAGEH gel (for p10
caspase-1 and IP, Invitrogen). After transfer onto PVDF
membranes, they were subjected to immunoblot analysis with
Malarial Hemozoin and the NLRP3 Inflammasome

the indicated Ab and matched secondary HRP-conjugated Ab. In
some experiments, optical density was determined using Alpha￾DigiDoc 1000 v3.2 software (Alpha Innotech corporation).
Confocal microscopy
OVA uptake: THP-1 cells (0.26106 cells/coverslip 12 mm from
Fisher) were treated with 10 mg of DQ-OVA in the absence or
presence of Hz (200 mg/mL) or Silica (400 mg/mL) for 30 min,
washed and incubated up to three hours. Laser settings were
adjusted on DQ-OVA fluorescence emission that is stronger than
hemozoin or silica. Phagosome: BMDM were fixed, permeabilized
using 0.1% Triton X-100, and non-specific surface Fcc-receptor
binding were blocked as described [54]. For immunofluorescence
experiments, cells were labelled with the rat anti-LAMP-1 Ab and
an anti-rat AlexaFluor 568. DRAQ5 was used to visualize DNA.
Cathepsin B activity: THP-1 cells (0.26106 cells/coverslip 12 mm
from Fisher) were pre-treated for 30 min with 5 mM of
piceatannol and stimulated or not with Hz (200 mg/mL). A
cathepsin B substract (Arg-Arg)2 linked with cresyl violet were
given 30 min before the end of incubation time and cleaved
substract generated a red fluorescence. All coverslips (THP-1/
OVA or BMDM) were mounted on slides with Fluoromount-G.
Detailed analysis of protein localization on the phagosome was
performed by using an oil immersion Nikon Plan Apo 100 (N.A.
1.4) objective mounted on a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope
equipped with a Bio-Rad Radiance 2000 confocal imaging system
(Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA).
In vivo neutrophil recruitment
WT, IL-1b-, NLRP3-, ASC-, caspase-1- and NLRC4-deficient
mice were injected intraperitoneally with 800 mg of hemozoin in
1 ml of endotoxin-free PBS. Control groups were injected with
1 mL of PBS. After six hours, the mice were euthanized and the
peritoneal cavity was washed with 10 mL of PBS. Cells recovered
from the peritoneum were counted and the percentage of
neutrophils was determined from an H&E stain (DiffQuick; Dade
Behring, Inc.) of a cytospun sample.
Statistical analysis
Unpaired Student’s t-test was used when comparing two groups
and ANOVA/Bonferroni test when comparing more than two
groups. The differences were considered significant when p,0.05.
Survival curves for infected and control mice were compared using
the Mantel-Haenszel test. Statistical analysis was performed using
Prism 5.00 software (GraphPad, San Diego, Calif.).
