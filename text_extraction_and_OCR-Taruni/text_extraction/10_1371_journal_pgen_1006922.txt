Abstract
Coordinated cardiomyocyte growth, differentiation, and morphogenesis are essential for
heart formation. We demonstrate that the bHLH transcription factors Hand1 and Hand2
play critical regulatory roles for left ventricle (LV) cardiomyocyte proliferation and morpho￾genesis. Using an LV-specific Cre allele (Hand1LV-Cre), we ablate Hand1-lineage cardio￾myocytes, revealing that DTA-mediated cardiomyocyte death results in a hypoplastic LV
by E10.5. Once Hand1-linage cells are removed from the LV, and Hand1 expression is
switched off, embryonic hearts recover by E16.5. In contrast, conditional LV loss-of-func￾tion of both Hand1 and Hand2 results in aberrant trabeculation and thickened compact
zone myocardium resulting from enhanced proliferation and a breakdown of compact
zone/trabecular/ventricular septal identity. Surviving Hand1;Hand2 mutants display
diminished cardiac function that is rescued by concurrent ablation of Hand-null cardio￾myocytes. Collectively, we conclude that, within a mixed cardiomyocyte population,
removal of defective myocardium and replacement with healthy endogenous cardiomyo￾cytes may provide an effective strategy for cardiac repair.
Author summary
The left ventricle of the heart drives blood flow throughout the body. Impaired left ventri￾cle function, associated either with heart failure or with certain, severe cardiac birth
defects, constitutes a significant cause of mortality. Understanding how heart muscle
grows is vital to developing improved treatments for these diseases. Unfortunately, genetic
tools necessary to study the left ventricle have been lacking. Here we engineer the first
mouse line to enable specific genetic study of the left ventricle. We show that, unlike in
the adult heart, the embryonic left ventricle is remarkably tolerant of cell death, as remain￾ing cells have the capacity to proliferate and to restore heart function. Conversely, disrup￾tion of two related genes, Hand1 and Hand2, within the left ventricle causes cells to

Ablation of these mutant cells rescues heart function. We conclude that selective removal
of defective heart muscle and replacement with healthy cells may provide an effective ther￾apy to treat heart failure.
Introduction
The left ventricle (LV) of the heart drives systemic circulation. Because the LV must be large
enough to support adequate cardiac output but not hypertrophic or hypoplastic, such that it
obstructs blood flow, congenital heart defects (CHDs) and acquired diseases that impact LV
morphology or cell number present a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the
human population [1]. These CHDs include left ventricular noncompaction or hypertrabecu￾lation (LVNC; OMIM: 604169), which is a cardiomyopathy characterized by prominent trabe￾culations occluding the ventricular lumen and associated with a high risk of heart failure and
sudden death [2, 3] and hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS; OMIM: 614435), which pres￾ents an underdeveloped LV unable to sustain sufficient blood flow [4, 5]. From the perspective
of adult cardiac disease, especially cardiomyopathies, it is of particular importance to establish
the capacity of proliferating cardiomyocytes to replace dead or dysfunctional cardiomyocytes
[1]. Critical breakthroughs in patient outcomes demand a better understanding of the etiology
of cardiac growth, differentiation and morphogenic patterning.
The embryonic heart forms from two distinct cardiomyocyte progenitor populations, termed
the primary (PHF) and secondary (SHF) heart fields, which give rise to the LV and right ventricle
(RV), respectively [6]. The bHLH transcription factor Hand1 is predominantly expressed within
the LV myocardium, with minimal expression in SHF derivatives [7]. Interestingly, HAND1
mutations have been identified in HLHS patients [8]; however, cardiac-specific Hand1 ablation
in mice does not recapitulate HLHS [9]. Previous studies suggest that the related bHLH transcrip￾tion factor Hand2 can functionally cooperate with Hand1 during murine LV development [9].
Although Cre-loxP technology has been used to great effect in mice to genetically model SHF
myocardium defects, the genetic tools to specifically interrogate genetic loss-of-function in LV
cardiomyocytes have, thus far, not been available.
We have isolated a conserved 744 bp enhancer 5’ to the Hand1 transcription start site
that is sufficient to drive reporter and Cre recombinase gene expression specifically within
the LV. Hand1LV-Cre recapitulates endogenous Hand1 expression within an estimated 80–
90% of LV cardiomyocytes between embryonic stages (E) E8.5-E13.5. Ablation of the
Hand1-lineage LV myocardium results in a markedly smaller LV by E10.5; however, LV
chamber size and adult cardiac function is ultimately rescued via proliferation of non￾Hand1-lineage LV cardiomyocytes.
In contrast to this LV cell ablation model, Hand1;Hand2 loss-of-function within the LV
results in increased cardiomyocyte proliferation resulting in morphogenic defects that lead to
the occlusion of the LV lumen. LV cardiomyocytes invade the LV chamber and show mis￾expression of compact zone, trabeculae, and intraventricular septum (IVS) restricted genes.
We reveal a cooperative Hand factor function that is required to morphogenetically specify
subpopulations of ventricular myocardium, and to thereby regulate cardiomyocyte growth.
Functional analysis of surviving Hand1;Hand2 double conditional knockouts (CKOs) reveals
impaired LV function that can be rescued by ablating the mutant Hand1 LV-lineage cells.
Taken together, these data suggest that, due to its inherent proliferative capacity, the

developing LV tolerates myocardial cell death, whereas developmentally abnormal cardiomyo￾cytes adversely impact cardiac function.
Results
A distal Hand1 enhancer recapitulates gene expression within the LV
We have identified a cis-regulatory element(s) that drives gene expression specifically within
the LV, and not within other cardiac tissues (Vincentz and Firulli, manuscript in preparation).
We used this Hand1 enhancer to make an LV-specific Cre driver. Lineage analysis using the
Hand1eGFPCre knock-in allele revealed that Hand1-lineage cells are restricted to the LV myocar￾dium and to a ring of SHF-derived myocardium occupying the OFT, termed the myocardial
cuff [7, 10]. Using the 2.7kb Hand1 basal promoter to provide the eGFPCre with a transcrip￾tional start site, we cloned the Hand1 LV-enhancer 5’ (Fig 1A) and generated several F0 trans￾genic lines. In two of these lines, Cre activity, as assessed via the R26RlacZ reporter allele, was
detectable within the forming LV at E9.0 (Fig 1E; white arrow) specifically marking only the
Hand1 LV cardiomyocyte-lineage (Fig 1E, 1G, 1I, 1K and 1M). Hand1-lineage epicardium
(black arrowhead; Fig 1H and 1I) and OFT tissues (Fig 1J and 1K; black arrows), detectable
from the Hand1eGFPCre allele, were not observed in the Hand1LV-Cre transgenic. Immunohis￾tochemistry using β-galactosidase to mark Cre-lineage cells and Mlc2v to mark ventricular car￾diomyocytes showed total co-localization of these two markers (S1A, S1C, S1E and S1G Fig),
whereas expression of β-galactosidase and PECAM, an endothelial/endocardial marker,
appears mutually exclusive (S1A, S1C, S1E and S1G Fig). Together, these data validate that this
Hand1LV-Cre driver recombines specifically within LV cardiomyocytes.
Cellular ablation of the Hand1LV-Cre embryonic LV myocardium results
in hypoplastic LV at E10.5 that fully recovers in size and function
To address the importance of the Hand1LV lineage during cardiac development, we utilized
the conditionally active Rosa26 (R26R) Diphtheria Toxin A chain (R26RDTA) allele to condi￾tionally ablate Hand1-expressing LV cardiomyocytes. Analysis of cell death via TUNEL on
E9.5 sections revealed that the LVs of Hand1LV-Cre; R26RlacZ/+ control embryos displayed few
apoptotic cells (Fig 2A), whereas Hand1LV-Cre; R26RlacZ/DTA LVs contained scattered TUNEL￾positive cells (Fig 2B, quantified in Fig 2C). However, given the robust LV expression of the
Hand1LV-Cre, fewer TUNEL-positive cells than would be predicted were detected in E9.5
R26RDTA-ablated LVs. Additional TUNEL staining, (Fig 2D) and whole mount lysotracker
staining at E10.5 revealed markedly increased cell death within the LV of Hand1LV-Cre;
R26RlacZ/DTA embryos when compared to controls (white arrows Fig 2E and 2F). At both time
points, no difference in cell death was observed in the RV myocardium (Fig 2A–2D, 2G and
2H), and cell death in the pharyngeal arches served as a positive control (white arrowheads Fig
2A, 2B and 2E–2H).
We then bred the R26RlacZ reporter onto the R26RDTA allele to monitor the loss of Hand1-
expressing LV cardiomyocytes in our ablation model. At E9.5, the Hand1-LV lineage is largely
absent from the heart, but the LV is not grossly hypoplastic (Fig 2J). By E10.5, the lack of
Hand1-LV lineage cells results in a markedly hypoplastic LV (Fig 2L). At E12.5, the LVs of
Hand1LV-Cre; R26RlacZ/DTA embryos were visibly smaller than Hand1LV-Cre; R26RlacZ/+ con￾trols (Fig 2M and 2N) and showed few X-gal-stained cells when compared to littermates that
do not carry the DTA allele. Interestingly, these mid-gestation LVs, from which the Hand1-
lineage has been ablated, do not display perturbed expression of the LV markers Nppa and
Gja5 (S2 Fig). Thus, ablation of Hand1-lineage LV myocardium between E8.5, when the

Hand1LV enhancer is first upregulated, and E12.5, when the Hand1LV enhancer begins down￾regulation, results in a hypoplastic LV.
To follow the biological impact of Hand1-LV lineage ablation, we assayed the phenotypes
of Hand1LV-Cre; R26RlacZ/DTA and control embryos at E16.5. To our surprise, Hand1LV-Cre;
R26RlacZ/DTA hearts were indistinguishable in size from controls that lacked the DTA allele (Fig
2O and 2P; arrows). X-gal staining confirmed that embryos that contain the DTA allele exhibit
minimal Hand1-lineage cells within their LVs. Although adult cardiomyocytes are refractory
to reentering the cell cycle [1, 11–13], embryonic and neonatal cardiomyocytes retain prolifer￾ative potential [14–16]. To confirm that the restoration of LV size was simply due to an
enhanced cardiomyocyte proliferation from non-Hand1-lineage LV myocardium, phospho￾Histone-H3 immunostaining was carried out at E12.5 and E14.5 (Fig 2Q–2U). Increased pro￾liferation was observed within the LVs of Hand1LV-Cre; R26RlacZ/DTA hearts, compared to con￾trols, at E14.5, but not at E12.5 (Fig 2U). Hand1LV-Cre; R26RlacZ/DTA mice were born at

reporter allele demonstrates that, like the Hand1eGFPCre knock-in allele (B, D, F, H, J, L), Hand1LV-Cre activity
initiates in the LV (white arrows) between E8.5 and E9.5 (C, E). Cre-lineage cells are detectable within the LV
at E10.5 (G, I) and E15.5 (K, M), but not within the epicardium (H, I; black arrowheads) or the outflow tract (H,
I; black arrows). la–left atrium, ra–right atrium, lv–left ventricle, rv–right ventricle.

apparent until E10.5 (K, L; n = 3) and persists at E12.5 (M, N; n = 4). Despite DTA-mediated ablation of the

Mendelian ratios (S3A Fig) and were viable and fertile. These hearts lacked gross structural
cardiac abnormalities, exhibiting only a subtle rounding of the free LV wall (S3B and S3C Fig).
These hearts exhibited cardiac function, as assayed by ejection fraction (EF), fractional short￾ening (FS), and other echocardiographic parameters, that was indistinguishable from Cre-neg￾ative controls (S3D–S3O Fig), and within the normal range for adult mice under isoflurane
anesthesia [17]. Taken together, these data demonstrate that embryonic ablation of the
Hand1-lineage is not sufficient to permanently disrupt LV development.
Myocardial deletion of Hand1 and Hand2 within the Hand1LV-Cre lineage
results in proliferative, morphological, and molecular abnormalities that
result in a hypoplastic LV lumen
As we have established that the Hand1-LV myocardial lineage is not required for cardiogenesis,
we next investigated whether the expression of Hand1 and Hand2 within the embryonic LV is
required for normal heart development. Although early embryonic expression analysis shows
that the majority of Hand2 expression within the heart is restricted to the endocardium, epicar￾dium, and SHF derived myocardium [10, 18, 19], at later embryonic stages, Hand2 mRNA
becomes detectable within E11.5 LV myocardium in a pattern overlapping with Hand1 (S4C
and S4D Fig). We subsequently generated compound heterozygous Hand1LV-Cre;Hand1fx/+;
Hand2fx/+ male mice and crossed them to Hand1fx/fx;Hand2fx/fx females to generate Hand1LV￾Cre;Hand1fx/fx;Hand2fx/fx offspring (Fig 3). Hand1LV-Cre;Hand1fx/+;Hand2fx/+ (Fig 3A–3D)
embryos undergo normal cardiac development and are indistinguishable from wild type con￾trols. Similarly, embryos that delete Hand2 from the LV but retain a single copy of Hand1
(Hand1LV-Cre;Hand1fx/+;Hand2fx/fx) also exhibit largely normal cardiac development (Fig 3E–
3H). Interestingly, consistent with previous studies [9], deletion of Hand1 from the LV
(Hand1LV-Cre;Hand1fx/fx) results in a morphologically disorganized LV, wherein Hand1-lineage
cells appear to localize more to trabeculations compared to the compact zone (Fig 3I–3L). At
E17.5, abnormal cardiomyocytes localize within the LV lumen (Fig 3L) and ventricular septal
defects are also observed (S5H Fig). Deletion of Hand1 from the LV leaving a single copy of
Hand2 (Hand1LV-Cre;Hand1fx/fx;Hand2fx/+) results in a similar phenotype (Fig 3M–3P, S5J–S5L
Fig). Complete deletion of Hand factors from the LV (Hand1LV-Cre;Hand1fx/fx;Hand2fx/fx)
caused a pronounced internalization of the Hand1-lineage cells where X-gal staining in whole
mount is noticeably opaque and in section reveals Hand1-lineage cells occluding the LV lumen
(Fig 3Q–3S). Histological analysis at E17.5 revealed severely occluded LV lumen and poorly
formed IVS (Fig 3T, S5M–S5O Fig), as well as a double outlet right ventricle (black arrowheads,
S5N Fig), and hyperplastic mitral valves (S5O Fig), although the aorta and OFT valves are phe￾notypically indistinguishable from controls (S5M Fig). These phenotypes are summarized in
Table 1. These data suggest that a Hand factor loss-of-function within the LV myocardium
alters chamber morphology via a Hand gene dosage dependent mechanism, in which Hand1-
lineage cells are found less frequently in the compact zone at the expense of increased cells
within the LV lumen representing trabecular and papillary muscle cardiomyocytes.
Surviving myocardial Hand1LV-Cre;Hand1fx/fx;Hand2fx/fx exhibit
compromised cardiac function
Despite the morphological defects observed in Hand1LV-Cre;Hand1fx/fx;Hand2fx/fx embryos,
Hand loss-of-function mice survive perinatally at approximately 50% of the expected Mende￾lian ratio (Table 2). Indeed, although Hand1LV-Cre;Hand1fx/fx;Hand2fx/fx pups are underrepre￾sented, this underrepresentation is not statistically significant (Table 2). Echocardiographic
analysis of P56 Hand1LV-Cre;Hand1fx/fx;Hand2fx/fx survivors (S6 Fig) revealed that systolic

function (fractional shortening and ejection fraction) is significantly compromised in
Hand1LV-Cre;Hand1 fx/fx;Hand2fx/fx mice (Fig 4), whereas other measures of LV morphology
and function, such as chamber dimensions and wall thickness, were not significantly altered
(S7 Fig).

LV cardiomyocytes are mis-specified in Hand1LV-Cre;Hand1fx/fx;
Hand2fx/fx mice
We next sought to characterize the etiology of the luminal cardiomyocyte overgrowth in
Hand1LV-Cre;Hand1fx/fx;Hand2fx/fx embryos. To this end, we performed marker analyses to
characterize distinct subpopulations of cardiomyocytes in the heart. The following expression
studies revealed no appreciable difference between (-);Hand1fx/fx;Hand2fx/fx, Hand1LV-Cre(+);
Hand1fx/+;Hand2fx/+, and Hand1LV-Cre(+);Hand1fx/+;Hand2fx/ fx embryos. For ease of presen￾tation, Hand1LV-Cre(+); Hand1fx/+;Hand2fx/+ embryos are presented as controls. Tbx20 and
Hey2 expression marks compact and IVS myocardium [20, 21]. Section in situ hybridization of
E11.5 hearts showed that Tbx20 and Hey2 are both expressed throughout the presumptive
compact myocardium and excluded from the trabecular myocardium in control hearts (Fig
5A and 5B). This sharp delineation between compact and trabecular myocardium is lost in the
LVs of Hand1LV-Cre(+); Hand1fx/fx;Hand2fx/+ hearts (Fig 5E and 5F; asterisks). In Hand1LV￾Cre;Hand1fx/fx;Hand2fx/fx hearts, most of the trabeculae within the LV ectopically express com￾pact myocardium markers, whereas the RV trabeculae do not (Fig 5I and 5J). Conversely, the
trabecular markers Bmp10 and Nppb show robust expression throughout the trabeculae, and
expression is largely excluded from the compact myocardium in control hearts (Fig 5C and
5D). In Hand1LV-Cre;Hand1fx/fx;Hand2fx/fx hearts, Bmp10 and Nppb expression is downregu￾lated within the LV trabeculae when compared to RV trabeculae (Fig 5K and 5L; asterisks).
We conclude that Hand1LV-Cre;Hand1fx/fx;Hand2fx/fx hearts display ectopic compact myocar￾dium marker expression and reduced trabecular marker expression within the LV.
Hand1LV-Cre;Hand1fx/fx;Hand2fx/fx hearts display abnormal trabecular
proliferation in the LV
By Carnegie Stage 16 in the human embryo (equivalent to E11.5 in mice) proliferation in the
ventricular trabeculae has declined [22]. We next sought to correlate differences in the prolif￾erative capacity of compact and trabecular myocardium with the overgrowth seen in
Hand1LV-Cre;Hand1fx/fx;Hand2fx/fx LVs. Mki67 marks cells actively undergoing cell cycle, but
is excluded from cells in G0 [23]. Mki67 immunohistochemistry revealed that, in control
embryos, nuclear Mki67 is robustly detected within compact myocardium and the IVS, but is
largely excluded from trabecular myocardium (Fig 5M–5P). In contrast, Hand1LV-Cre;

Hand1fx/fx;Hand2fx/fx trabecular cardiomyocytes show robust Mki67 staining (Fig 5Q–5T;
arrowheads). These findings indicate that cardiomyocyte proliferation is dysregulated within
the LV of Hand1LV-Cre;Hand1fx/fx;Hand2fx/fx embryos.
Hand1LV-Cre;Hand1fx/fx;Hand2fx/fx hearts display abnormal expansion of
ventricular septum markers into the LV
Previous studies have reported that ectopic HAND1 expression throughout the heart disrupts
IVS formation [24]. We reasoned that the abnormal proliferation and marker expression seen
in Hand1LV-Cre;Hand1fx/fx;Hand2fx/fx hearts may reflect aberrant ventricular septogenesis. Sec￾tion in situ hybridization of E11.5 hearts showed that expression of the chemokine Cxcl12 is
strong in the free walls of the ventricles, but is largely excluded from the IVS (Fig 6A). In both

DTA ablation rescues the lethality and cardiac dysfunction seen in
Hand1;Hand2 conditional knockouts
Given that the embryonic heart can recover from DTA-mediated ablation of Hand1-lineage
cardiomyocytes, we tested whether ablation of Hand1;Hand2-null cardiomyocytes can rescue
the phenotypes associated with their loss-of-function. The R26RDTA allele was bred onto a

we interpret as cells that have recombined only the lacZ reporter, but not the DTA allele.
Hand1LV-Cre;Hand1fx/fx;Hand2fx/fx;R26RDTA pups survive at Mendelian ratios (Table 3) and
display restored ejection fraction (Fig 7M) and fractional shortening (Fig 7N). Again, other
measures of cardiac function were not significantly altered (S8E–S8J Fig).Together, these data
demonstrate that ablation of mutant cardiomyocytes from the developing LV restores cardiac
function.
Discussion
CHDs that alter the LV exhibit poor clinical outcomes [5, 26]. The inability to interrogate LV
gene expression in isolation has limited the ability to understand the molecular mechanisms
that drive LV morphogenesis. This study reports the generation of a novel LV-restricted Cre
driver line that allows for such focused interrogation. First, we ablated Hand1-lineage cardio￾myocytes within an E9.0-E13.5 developmental window. As expected, LV size was greatly
reduced by E10.5, and this reduced size remains clear at E14.5 (Fig 2). Hand1 cardiac expres￾sion is downregulated by E13.5 [27]. We observed a significant increase in LV cardiomyocyte
cell proliferation at E14.5 (Fig 2U). By E16.5, LV size is indistinguishable from control hearts
(Fig 2O and 2P). These findings support published data showing that embryonic and up to
7-day postnatal cardiomyocytes retain regenerative potential [14–16], and further demonstrate
that the Hand1-lineage can be ablated from the developing LV, and the heart can nonetheless
undergo full regenerative repair. It is also clear that these replacement cardiomyocytes do not
express Hand1—if they did, Cre would also be expressed, thereby activating DTA expression
and killing the replacement cell. That said, conclusive identification of the origin(s) of the cells
that replace the ablated Hand1-lieage cells will require further study employing, for example,
dual lineage tracing systems. A candidate for this progenitor population is the SHF. One of the
most well studied markers of the SHF is the Isl1-Cre [28]. Although it is excluded from the
majority of LV cardiomyocytes, Isl1-Cre-lineage cells do appear in the LV [28–31], and it is
possible that this relatively minor population expands in the absence of Hand1-lineage cells.
Indeed, this would explain why early stage DTA-ablation embryos, despite almost completely
lacking Cre-lineage cells, are grossly similar to non-ablated littermates (Fig 2I and 2J). If this
were the case, it would indicate that SHF-derived cardiomyocytes are sufficient to replace
PHF-derived cardiomyocytes. Regardless of potential contributions from other cardiomyocyte
lineages, including the SHF, these observations indicate that Hand1-lineage cells are not
required for cardiac development, and that, through elevated proliferation, a Hand1-negative
fated cardiomyocyte population within the developing heart is sufficient to generate a func￾tional LV.
In contrast, Hand1 and Hand2 are required for normal LV morphogenesis. By E11.5, both
Hand genes are expressed within the LV myocardium (S4 Fig). Loss of Hand1, and, more

severely, Hand1 and Hand2, leads to abnormal LV morphology characterized by expanded
compact and IVS marker expression (Tbx20, Hey2, Dkk3, Irx2; Figs. 5 and 6) and correspond￾ingly reduced trabecular marker expression. An increase in Mki67-positive nuclei (Fig 5M–
5T) within the LV trabecular zone indicates that aberrant cell proliferation causes the observed
LV hyperplasia. Taking these observations together, we conclude that the expanding cardio￾myocyte population observed in Hand1LV-Cre;Hand1fx/fx;Hand2fx/fx mutants is derived from
myocardium that has ectopically activated the IVS gene expression program. The Hand1-line￾age marks very little of the IVS [7]. Proliferation in Hand1LV-Cre;Hand1fx/fx;Hand2fx/fx mutant
hearts is not restricted to this small domain of Hand1-expressing IVS cells on the inner wall
near the cardiac apex. This suggests that some Hand1-lineage compact zone myocardium
adopts an IVS cell-like fate. The observation that the Hand1-lineage within Hand1LV-Cre;
Hand1fx/fx;Hand2fx/fx mutant hearts is largely excluded from the LV compact zone, and is
instead localized to the inner curvature supports this finding. These results are especially inter￾esting in light of recent studies, which propose that LVNC likely results from abnormal growth
of compact myocardium [32]. It would be informative to test whether IVS markers also
expand into luminal domains in such models.
In addition to LVNC, these Hand1LV-Cre;Hand1fx/fx;Hand2fx/fx mutants share certain pheno￾typic similarities with HLHS patients; however, they lack the aortic valve phenotypes characteris￾tic of HLHS (S5M Fig). A recently published mouse model of HLHS [33] posits a digenic
etiology of HLHS, in which dysfunction of one gene disrupts cardiomyocyte proliferation and
differentiation to cause LV hypoplasia, while a second mutation causes aortic valve abnormalities.
Importantly, these findings provide evidence that the aortic phenotypes are not secondary to the
LV phenotypes, and therefore, the lack of Hand1LV-Cre;Hand1fx/fx;Hand2fx/fx aortic defects is not
surprising. As mentioned, a subset of HLHS patients displays HAND1 mutations [8]. Hand1 is
expressed in the OFT [27] as well as the LV, and as such could have pleiotropic functions in both
aortic valve and LV development; however, ablation of Hand1 in the neural crest progenitors of
the aortic valves is not pathogenic [34]. Given that this study reports the unexpected finding that
Hand1 and Hand2 have overlapping roles in LV development, it would be of interest to reevalu￾ate Hand1 function in the OFT considering potential functional redundancy with Hand2.
Increased cardiomyocyte proliferation can negatively impact specification [14, 15]. The
Hand1LV-Cre;Hand1fx/fx;Hand2fx/fx LV hyperplasia occludes so much of the LV lumen that it
results, in severe cases, in a single ventricle phenotype (Fig 3T, S5N Fig). In spite of the significant
LV hyperplasia, 50% of Hand1LV-Cre;Hand1fx/fx;Hand2fx/fx mutants survive to birth and live to
adulthood. These surviving individuals exhibit compromised systolic function (Fig 4). It is clear
that both Hand1 and Hand2 contribute to this phenotype, and that Hand1 plays a more signifi￾cant role. Hand1LV-Cre;Hand1fx/+;Hand2fx/fx mutants display no observable cardiac phenotypes,
whereas Hand1LV-Cre;Hand1fx/fx;Hand2+/+ and Hand1LV-Cre;Hand1fx/x;Hand2fx/+ mutants show
both morphological and molecular changes in gene expression. Given that Hand2 LV expression
is not detectable until E11.5, and its LV expression is not dependent upon Hand1, Hand1 mutants
are less severe likely due to the later expression of Hand2.
Finally, we observe a functional rescue of Hand1LV-Cre;Hand1fx/fx;Hand2fx/fx mutants when
mutant cells are ablated via co-activation of DTA expression (Fig 7). Given that heart develop￾ment does not require the Hand1-lineage (Fig 2) this may not be surprising. Nevertheless, this
observation suggests that removal of molecularly abnormal cardiomyocytes from a developing
heart could be beneficial if molecularly normal cells are present and are still proliferative.

Transgenic mice
The Indiana University Transgenic and Knock-Out Mouse Core generated the Hand1LV-Cre
transgenic mouse line on a C3HeB/FeJ background. Genotyping of the Hand1tm2Eno,
Hand2tm1Cse, Gt(ROSA)26Sortm1(DTA)Jpmb, and Gt(ROSA)26Sortm1Sor alleles has previously been
described [9, 10, 35, 36]. These mice were maintained on a mixed C57Bl/6;129S background.
Embryos were not selected for sex, and were evaluated blindly for all analyses. Mice and other
reagents are available from the authors upon request.
Cloning
To generate the Hand1LV-Cre transgene, the genomic sequence corresponding to
chr11:57660605–57661348 (in the mm9 assembly) was cloned 5’ to a modified eGFP-Cre vec￾tor driven by the basal Hand1 2.7kb promoter. Mice were genotyped for the Cre allele either
via Southern blot or PCR using the primers Cre(F) 5’-CGTACTGACGGTGGGAGAAT-3’
and Cre(R) 5’-TGCATGATCTCCGGTATTGA-3’, with the internal controls Smad4(F) 5’-
TAAGAGCCACAGGGTCAAGC-3’ and Smad4(R) 5’-TTCCAGGAAAAACAGGGCTA-3’.
X-gal staining and histology
X-gal staining was performed as previously described [7, 19, 37, 38].
Lysotracker and TUNEL
Cell death analysis on control and mutant embryos was performed as described [39]. Lyso￾tracker (Life Technologies) was incubated with embryos as per the manufacturer’s instruc￾tions. Embryos were imaged in a well slide on a Leica DM5000 B compound florescent
microscope. TUNEL analyses were performed upon sectioned embryos using the ApopTag
Plus Fluorescein in situ Apoptosis detection kit (S7111 Chemicon International) as per manu￾facturer’s instructions. TUNEL-positive cells occupying the free wall of the LV and RV
(including the myocardial outflow tract) were counted every other section. Significance was
determined by student’s t-test.
Immunohistochemistry and quantification of cell proliferation
Immunohistochemistry was performed as previously described [19, 40–42]. β-galactosidase
(Aves BGL-1010; 1:200 dilution), Mlc2v (Synaptic Systems 310 111; 1:500), PECAM (BD Phar￾mingen 550274; 1:200), Phospho-Histone H3 (Abcam 4797; 1:500), and Mki67 (Dako; 1:500)
antibodies were used with biotinylated secondary antibodies and streptavidin-conjugated
DyLight 488 or 594 fluorophores (ThermoFisher). Images were collected on a Leica DM5000
B microscope and Leica Application Suite software.
Cell proliferation was assayed via counting of phospho-histone H3 positive nuclei. Left and
right ventricles from E12.5 and E14.5 immunostained images were manually isolated in Adobe
Photoshop, and nuclei were manually counted using Image J software. For E12.5, n9 sec￾tions, and for E14.5, n10 sections per heart were counted. Total samples analyzed were as
follows: E12.5, control embryos (Hand1LV-Cre(-); R26RlacZ/DTA)–n = 2, RV, 35057 cells, total,
LV, 35250 cells, total; LV-ablated embryos (Hand1LV-Cre(+); R26RlacZ/DTA)–n = 5, RV, 81471

Echocardiography
Mice were lightly anesthetized with mixture of 1% to 1.5% isoflurane and 100% oxygen while
supine on a heated platform. The heart rate were stabilized at 400 to 500 beats per minute
before image recording. Images were obtained with a high resolution Micro-Ultrasound sys￾tem (Vevo 2100, VisualSonics Inc, Toronto, Canada) equipped with a 40-MHz mechanical
scan probe. Two-dimensional images were recorded in the parasternal long and short-axis to
guide M-mode recordings in the mid-ventricular level. LV systolic function was computed
from M-mode measurement according to the recommendations of American Society of Echo￾cardiography committee [43].
Ethics statement
Animal work was approved by the Indiana University School of Medicine Animal Care and
use committee (IACUC) via protocol 10809 Issued to ABF.
