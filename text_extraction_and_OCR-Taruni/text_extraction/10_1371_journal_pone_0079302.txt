Abstract
Background: The prognostic importance of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal pro BNP (NT-proBNP) in patients
with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) remains controversial.
Methodology/Principal Findings: We conducted an unrestricted search from the MEDLINE and EMBASE in all languages
that were published between 1966 and Augest2013. Twenty-seven long-term prospective studies met our inclusion
criterias. From the pooled analysis, elevated BNP/NT-proBNP was significantly associated with increased all cause mortality
[odds ratio (OR), 3.85; 95% CI, 3.11 to 4.75], cardiovascular mortality (OR, 4.05; 95% CI, 2.53 to 6.84), and cardiovascular
events (OR, 7.02; 95% CI, 2.21 to 22.33). The funnel plot showed no evidence of publication bias. The corresponding pooled
positive and negative likelihood ratio for prediction of all cause mortality were 1.86 (95% CI, 1.66 to 2.08) and 0.48 (95% CI,
0.42 to 0.55), respectively.
Conclusions/Significance: BNP/NT-proBNP is a promising prognostic tool to risk-stratify the patients with ESRD. Further
investigations are warranted to elucidate the specific pathogenic mechanisms and the impact of other potential prognostic
factors.

Introduction
Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of morbidity and
mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD),
accounting for approximately 50% of the deaths [1]. Early
identification of ESRD patients at high risk for future events may
facilitate more aggressive and focused treatments.
B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is a 32-amino acid polypeptide
secreted by ventricles of the heart in response to excessive
stretching of cardiomyocytes. This peptide is believed to play an
important role in regulating blood pressure and volume through
direct effects on the kidney and systemic vasculature. BNP is co￾secreted along with a 76-amino acid polypeptide, NT-proBNP,
which is more stable and biologically inactive [2]. Measurement of
circulating natriuretic peptide (NPs), BNP or NT-proBNP has
been recommended in the diagnosis and prognosis of patients with
acute or chronic heart failure [3]. Given the high prevalence of left
ventricular (LV) hypertrophy and systolic dysfunction in patients
with ESRD [4,5,6,7], it has been proposed that the NPs may assist
in risk stratification for cardiovascular events among patients with
ESRD.
The past few years have seen a rapidly growing interest in
testing this hypothesis. Many prospective studies have investigated
the link between NPs and the adverse outcomes in ESRD patients,
and most found a positive association. However, the magnitudes of
the association varied between studies and most of them have not
been systematically assessed. Several previous relevant reviews
involved only about one-fourth of the currently available data
[8,9]. In addition, interpretation of the evidence has been
complicated by studies that have involved different markers (ie,
BNP, NT-proBNP, or both), different disease outcomes (eg, all￾cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality or events) and the impact
of other prognostic variables besides NPs. To help resolve this
uncertainty of BNP/NT-proBNP as a prognostic tool, our goal,
therefore, was to quantify the association between BNP/NT￾proBNP and long-term adverse outcomes by conducting a meta￾analysis of these prospective studies.

Proposal for Reporting [10].and follows PRISMA guidelines
(Checklist S1).
Research Objectives
The primary research objective was to determine, by use of
systematic review techniques, whether elevated circulating BNP
and/or NT-proBNP predicted long-term risks of all-cause
mortality, cardiovascular mortality or cardiovascular events
(defined as any fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke,
transient ischemic attack, or heart failure) among patients with
ESRD. The secondary objective was to determine the ability of
BNP or NT-proBNP to discriminate the patients who do and do
not experience subsequent events.
Data Sources and Selection
To identify relevant studies, MEDLINE (1966- Aug., 2013),
EMBASE (1980- Aug., 2013) were reviewed without language
restrictions. The electronic searches were completed by manual
search of the reports’ reference lists. The search strategy,
developed with an experienced librarian, included the following
terms: 1) end stage, kidney disease, renal disease, dialysis,
hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, renal replacement therapy; 2)
natriuretic peptide, B-type natriuretic peptide, brain natriuretic
peptide, N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide, BNP, NT￾proBNP); 3) mortality, all-cause mortality, cardiac death, cardio￾vascular diseases, myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction,
coronary stenosis, cerebrovascular disorders, stroke; and 4) cohort
studies, prospective studies, and follow-up studies.
Study Selection
We first performed an initial screening of titles or abstracts. The
second screening was based on full-text review. Studies were
considered eligible if they met the following criteria: 1) prospective
observational study design; and studies that 2) evaluated the
prognosis of patients with abnormal levels of either BNP or NT￾proBNP in ESRD patients, 3) examined all cause mortality,
cardiovascular mortality or cardiovascular events. We exclude
studies that did not report tabular data for the outcomes
separately.
Quality Review
All studies included for methodological and reporting quality
were evaluated according to Egger’s quality checklist for
prognostic studies [11], adapting the checklist for the purposes
of this review because all the included studies were prognostic in
nature. Two authors (YJ Cheng and FJ Yao) independently rated
study quality. Percentage agreement between the 2 reviewers on
the items on the quality review ranged from 84% to 100%.
Disagreements were resolved by consensus.
Data Abstraction
Data on the following characteristics were independently
extracted with standardized data extraction protocols and
corresponded with study authors to obtain supplementary tabular
data: study size; geographical location; year of baseline survey; age
range of participants at baseline; percentage of female participants;
mean duration of follow-up; storage temperature; NPs assay
methods; the number and type (all cause death, cardiovascular
death and event) of outcome event. In instances of multiple
publications, the most up-to-date or comprehensive information
was used.
Data Synthesis and Analysis
Summary estimates of the univariate odds ratio (OR) and
likelihood ratios were calculated using the random effects model
because fixed and random-effects model results were similar and
random-effects models tend to produce more conservative
estimates. In the case of papers that gave multiple cut-off points
for BNP analysis, the score that gave the maximum overall
accuracy was chosen. As studies used different cut-off points for
defining raised BNP or NT-proBNP, we calculated Spearman’s
correlation coefficient between sensitivity and specificity [12]. This
looks for the presence of a threshold effect, where variations in
sensitivity and specificity are related to differences in the cut-off
point used to define an abnormal result. If there is no evidence of a
threshold effect then likelihood ratios can be pooled. Consistency
of findings across studies was assessed by Cochran’s Q and the I2
statistic [13]. Heterogeneity was assssed by comparing results from
studies grouped according to prespecified study-level characteris￾tics with meta-regression. Small study bias, consistent with
publication bias was assessed with funnel plot (i.e. a plot of study
results against precision), by Begg’s adjusted rank correlation test,
and by Egger’s regression asymmetry test [14].
All analyses were performed using STATA version 11.0 (Stata
Corp LP, College Station, Texas, USA). A P value,0.05 was
considered statistically significant.
Results
Literature Search
From the search strategy, 741 unique citations were initially
retrieved. Of these, the majority were excluded after the first
screening based on abstracts or titles, mainly because they were
reviews, case-control studies, not BNP/NT-proBNP associated, or

not relevant to our analysis. After full-text review of 55 papers, 14
studies were excluded because they recruited non-ESRD patients,
and 5 were excluded due to duplicate publications. An additional 9
studies in which the outcomes of interest were not evaluated or not
reported separately were also excluded. Finally, 27 studies were
included in our meta-analysis (Figure 1).
Methodological Quality
The 27 prospective studies were determined to be of fair quality.
Of the primary studies, 59% reported details of exclusion criteria.
However, few studies (30%) had explicitly ascertained that patients
did not have any acute symptoms of congestive heart failure. The
majority of studies (96%) reported at least 1 cardiac risk factor, and
77% reported baseline cardiovascular history. However, only 37%
of studies indicated the participants’ baseline medication use. All
the studies described the BNP/NT-proBNP assays and reported
cutoff values to define normal and abnormal levels. BNP/NT￾proBNP values were known for all patients. All the studies
described treatments or management of patients during follow-up.
Only a minority (30%) of primary studies specified the number of
patients lost to follow-up, with 22% reporting that no patients were
lost to follow-up.
Study Characteristics
Twenty-seven relevant studies reporting on 8,666 individuals
were identified from 16 countries. Thirteen studies were based in
Europe [4,7,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25], 5 in North Amer￾ica [5,26,27,28,29,30], 2 in Australia [31,32] and and 6 in East
Asia [6,33,34,35,36,37]. From all primary studies, over 63.4% of
patients were receiving hemodialysis (HD). Of the total popula￾tion, 57.1% were males and the median (or mean) ages of the
cohorts ranged from 48.6 to 70 years. The mean duration on
dialysis was 36 months and the patients followed for an average of
23 months (range, 12 to 60 months). Fifteen studies reported
associations with NT-proBNP only, 8 with BNP only, and 4 with
both NPs. The median value of NT-proBNP and BNP levels
varied substantially across available studies (NT-proBNP values
ranged from 288 to 9761 pg/mL; BNP values ranged from 116.8
to 570 pg/mL), with a tendency toward higher values in
individuals with higher incidence of cardiovascular disease at
entry. Table 1 and Table 2 demonstrates variability in

prevalence of diabetes mellitus (or diabetic nephropathy), prior
history of cardiovascular disease, length of follow-up of individual
studies and mean number of years spent on dialysis, characteristics
of the assays and outcomes across the individual studies.
Association with All-cause Mortality
There were 22 primary studies evaluating the association
between BNP and all-cause mortality. In the forest plot of
individual prognostic effect sizes in Table 3, Figure 2, Figure S1
and Table S1 the lower boundaries of the 95% CIs of almost trials
were greater than 1, suggesting a consistent association between
BNP and all cause mortality. From the pooled analysis, elevated
BNP was significantly associated with increased all-cause mortality
(OR, 3.57; 95% CI, 3.17 to 4. 02). There was statistical
heterogeneity between studies (I2= 55.81%, 95% CI, 29.45% to
72.33%, P = 0.001). However, little of the heterogeneity was
explained by type of NP assayed, type of dialysis, location, number
of participants and events, sample type and storage temperature,
percentage of coronary artery disease at baseline, publication year.
Studies that followed up more than 3 years tended to report

study level characteristics.

somewhat higher ORs than studies with shorter follow-up
duration (P = 0.04; Figure 2).
The sensitivity and specitivity of increased BNP or NT-proBNP
levels to predict all cause mortality were 0.70 (95% CI, 0.65 to
0.74) and 0.63 (95% CI, 0.58 to 0.67), respectively. Spearman’s
correlation between sensitivity and specificity was 0.08 (P = 0.70),
suggesting no evidence of a threshold effect. We therefore
calculated pooled positive (PLR) and negative likelihood ratios
(NLR). The summary PLR was 1.86 (95% CI, 1.66 to 2.08) and
NLR was 0.48 (95% CI, 0.42 to 0.55). There was statistical
heterogeneity for the PLR (I2= 58.72%, 95% CI, 58.72% to
83.19%, P = 0.001) and NLR (I2= 57.66%, 95% CI, 38.05% to
77.27%, P = 0.001) (Figure 3).
Visual inspection of the Begg funnel plot did not identify
substantial asymmetry. The Begg rank correlation test and Egger
linear regression test also indicated no evidence of publication bias
among studies of either NP and all-cause mortality (Begg, P = 0.49;
Egger, P = 0.22) (Figure 4).
Association with Cardiovascular Mortality or Events
The elevated BNP/NT-proBNP was associated with increased
cardiovascular mortality (OR: 4.05; 95% CI, 2.53 to 6.84) with
high heterogeneity (I2= 80.38%, 95% CI, 64.77% to 89.07%,
P,0.001) (Table 3, Figure S2 and Table S1). When we removed
the study by Foley and colleagues that reported a lower OR in a
large population [30], the OR for the remaining studies did not
materially change (4.58; 95% CI: 3.40 to 6.17; P,0.001), but
heterogeneity was decreased to 36.56% (95% CI: 0.00% to
70.81%; P = 0.13).
There were 6 studies that reported the association with
cardiovascular events. Elevated BNP/NT-proBNP was strongly
associated with a significant increase in long-term cardiac events
(OR:7.02; 95% CI: 2.21 to 22.33; P,0.001) (Table 3, Figure S3
and Table S1). BNP/NT-proBNP had better pooled sensitivity
(0.80 vs 0.75), specificity (0.64 vs 0.60), PLR (2.21 vs 1.87) and
NLR (0.32 vs 0.42) for cardiovascular events prediction than for
cardiovascular mortality prediction (figure S4, figure S5).
Discussion
The present meta-analysis of more than 8000 patients with
ESRD from 27 long-term prospective studies provides evidence
that elevated BNP/NT-proBNP predicted approximately a four￾fold increase in the risk of all cause mortality and cardiovascular
mortality, and over a seven-fold increase in the risk of
cardiovascular events.
Although NT-proBNP is more stable with longer half-life than
BNP (<120 minutes versus <20 minutes, respectively) [2] and has
theoretical superiority for prognostication, the present data suggest
that a given proportional increment in each marker is similarly
associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality. On the basis
of indirect comparisons with previous meta-analysis of several
established risk factors, the magnitude of death risk with BNP/
NT-proBNP concentration appears to be stronger than those with
C-reactive protein, albumin, troponin or homocysteine [38,39,40].
Understanding the mechanisms that underlie elevation in BNP/
NT-proBNP levels among ESRD patients is of particular
importance to help frame appropriate therapeutic decisions.
Previous studies have suggested that the mechanism for a rise in
NPs among ESRD patients was a result of LV structural and
functional abnormalities [6,41], enabling NPs to be a potential
marker of LV hypertrophy in ESRD [42,43]. In addition,there is
emerging evidence that increases in circulating NPs may indicate
myocardial ischemia or necrosis, due to the coronary atheroscle￾rosis prevalent in patients with ESRD [6,44], supported by a
strong relationship between elevated BNP/NT-proBNP and
cardiovascular mortality/events in our analysis. Furthermore,
given that BNP and NT-pro-BNP are released in response to
increased myocardial wall stress, it is tempting to hypothesize that
circulating NPs levels may be a useful marker of volume status in
ESRD patients [45,46]. The fluid overload may affect the intensity
of chronic inflammation through the presence of intestinal wall
edema, which allows a translaocation of bacteria endotoxin from
intestinal lumen to bloodstream and contribute to an increased
mortality in patients with ESRD [47]. However, other studies
failed to detect a positive association between fluid removed and
change of BNP in patients receiving HD [41,48], suggesting that
this mechanism needs to be further elucidated.
There is one factor that may confound the interpretation of
elevated NPs in ESRD patients. Previous authors have suggested
that BNP and NT-proBNP concentrations are strongly correlated
with residual renal function [49,50], making both NPs potentially
lose prognostic value in ESRD patients. Nevertheless, several latest
studies have reported both NPs are only 20% or less dependent on
renal function for their clearance [51,52,53], indicating BNP/NT￾proBNP to be a prognostic marker for patients with ESRD.
Along with the strict inclusion criteria, strengths of this meta￾analysis include the large number of patients analyzed, the
robustness of the findings at sensitivity analyses, the fact that all
subgroup analyses were prespecified a priori. The absence of
important publication bias supports the robustness of the study
findings. Although the present study involves over 4 times as much
information as in previous reviews [8,9], it has been limited by the
moderate amount of available data from primary studies. For
example, of the 27 studies, risk estimates for cardiovascular
mortality and events were only available from 10 and 6 studies,

respectively. The studies included in our analysis used different
cut-off points to define high-risk, which varied significantly
between studies. In the analysis with all cause mortality as the
end-point, the ‘best-fit’ cut-off point ranged from surprisingly low
to expectedly high in different studies. This variation in cut-off
point is at least in part related to the significant heterogeneity in
patient population between the different studies. From the
currently available data it is not possible to draw any firm
conclusions regarding the most appropriate cut-off point for risk
stratification. Another acknowledged limitation to the meta￾analysis is the inability to adjust statistically for identical covariates
or prognostic factors that could have influenced the outcomes of
ESRD. In addition, although serum concentration of BNP is
associated with residual renal function and left ventricular
dysfunction, the limited data of glomerular filtration rate and left
ventricular ejection fraction reported in the original studies made
it difficult to conduct a further statistical investigation.
BNP/NT-proBNP is a promising prognostic tool to risk-stratify
stable, asymptomatic ESRD patients, as elevated levels identify a
subset of ESRD patients who have poor survival and higher risk of
cardiovascular events. This study corroborates previous postulates
that a cardiovascular cause underlies the association between
mortality and elevated BNP or NT-proBNP in ESRD patients.
Further studies, including well-designed clinical trials, are
warranted to elucidate the specific pathogenic mechanisms, and
the impact of other potential prognostic factors.
