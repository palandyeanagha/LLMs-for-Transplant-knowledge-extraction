ABSTRACT
Objective: To investigate the effects of exenatide on blood glucose, body weight and hepatic en￾zymes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and concomitant non-alcoholic fatty liver 
disease (NAFLD). Subjects and methods: One hundred and seventeen patients with T2DM and 
NAFLD were randomly divided into exenatide group and metformin group. Patients were treated 
with exenatide and metformin, respectively, for 12 weeks. Results: After 12 weeks of treatment, body 
weight, body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio, HbA1c, FPG, 2-h PPG, ALT, AST, γ-GT, and hs-CRP 
were significantly reduced, and the AST/ALT ratio and adiponectin were markedly increased in both 
groups. BMI, waist-to-hip ratio, 2-h PPG, ALT, AST, γ-GT, and hs-CRP were markedly lower, and AST/
ALT ratio and adiponectin in the exenatide group were dramatically higher than in the metformin 
group. Conclusion: Compared with metformin, exenatide is better to control blood glucose, reduces 
body weight and improves hepatic enzymes, attenuating NAFLD in patients with T2DM concomitant 
with NAFLD. Arq Bras Endocrinol Metab. 2013;57(9):702-8

iNTRODUCTION 
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), obesity, and non-
-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are often 
identified in patients simultaneously. In patients with 
T2DM, the prevalence of NAFLD is as high as 75% 
(1). NAFLD represents the hepatic manifestation of 
the metabolic syndrome, which includes dyslipidemia, 
central obesity, hypertension, and insulin resistance (1). 
The prevalence of obesity and diabetes is increasing in 
China (2) and, thus, one may expect an increase in the 
incidence of NAFLD in T2DM in China. Although 
NAFLD and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are 
generally asymptomatic, the increase in serum alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT), a biochemical marker of liver 
injury, has been regarded as indicative of NAFLD (3).

NAFLD can cause progressive fibrosis leading to 
cirrhosis and corresponding complications, including 
portal hypertension and liver failure (1). In addition, 
NAFLD is thought to be an independent determinant 
of cardiovascular disease (CVD), besides affecting in￾dividuals who already have multiple cardiovascular risk 
factors. This relationship may lead to an increased risk 
of undesired outcomes in this population of patients, 
and increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality 
(4). Moreover, NAFLD is a complex syndrome that 
affects more than the liver. 
Although the pathogenesis of NAFLD is still poorly 
understood, the relationship between NAFLD and in￾sulin resistance make insulin resistance a therapeutic tar￾get. Evidence has indicated that lifestyle modifications, 
with weight loss and exercise, can improve, NAFLD (5-
7). This has stimulated the conduction of several clini￾cal studies in which anti-diabetic drugs, such as insulin 
sensitizers, including metformin, have been evaluated 
in NAFLD patients with insulin-resistance. 
Most of findings show no clear benefit from the 
addition of metformin to diet or rosiglitazone, thou￾gh the Alanine aminotransferase levels can be reduced 
by metformin treatment. It is indicated that metformin 
might be of benefit in the treatment of NAFLD, while 
associated to hypocaloric diet and weight control. The 
lack of benefit was because patients in the control group 
improved on diet, and metformin had little effect on 
liver histology (8). So, metformin as a hypoglycemic 
agent may be not reliable to alleviate NAFLD. 
A new drug, glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue, 
such as exenatide, may be an effective anti-diabetic 
agent. Exenatide is a synthetic analog of exendin-4, 
a 39-amino-acid agonist of glucagon-like peptide 1 
(GLP-1) receptor. Exendin-4 is found in the saliva of 
the Gila monster, Heloderma suspectum, and shares 53% 
sequence homology with GLP-1 (9). GLP-1 is a gas￾trointestinal hormone secreted by the L cells of the in￾testine, which can regulate blood glucose primarily via 
stimulation of glucose-dependent insulin release. The￾refore, exenatide may not function as a direct insulin 
sensitizer, but may induce clinically significant weight 
loss, leading to an insulin-sensitizing effect.
However, in a murine model of fatty liver, exen￾din-4 significantly reduced glucose levels, improved 
insulin sensitivity, and reduced hepatic steatosis (10). 
In an open-label, uncontrolled clinical trial using exe￾natide to assess the safety of the drug in patients with 
diabetes, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and insulin 
sensitivity were improved over a 3.5-year follow-up 
period (11). Why can exenatide reverse hepatic bio￾markers and type 2 diabetes with fatty liver? Is it by 
improving insulin sensitivity or by another way? When 
compared with metformin, exenatide is more effective 
in reducing body weight. Thus, we wonder if exenati￾de may serve as a drug in the treatment of NAFLD to 
effectively improve the hepatic biomarkers.
The present study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic 
effect of exenatide in NAFLD. In order to achieve this 
aim, plasma glucose, body weight, liver enzymology, 
serum C reactive protein (CRP), and adiponectin were 
evaluated after the treatment with exenatide or metfo￾min in T2DM patients with NAFLD. 
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
Patients
From March 2009 to December 2010, a total of 134 
patients with T2DM and NAFLD were enrolled in the 
present study. At the end of study, 117 patients were re￾cruited for analysis, including 66 males and 51 females. 
The inclusion criteria were as follows: T2DM concomi￾tant with NAFLD, poor glucose control (FBG: 6.0-10.0 
mmol/L or HbA1c: 7-9%), no acute complications or 
severe chronic complications of DM. The criteria for 
DM developed by the World Health Organization in 
1999 were employed for the diagnosis of DM. Exclu￾sion criteria were as follows: abnormal kidney function, 
serum Cr ≥ 133 μmol/L, presence of diseases affec￾ting blood glucose levels (such as hyperthyroidism and 
hypercortisolism), treatments affecting blood glucose 
levels (such as steroid hormones), pregnancy, breast-
-feeding, and patients with history of chronic drinking. 
All patients were diagnosed with T2DM concomitant 
with NAFLD; 52% of patients had abnormal liver func￾tion (ALT > upper limit of normal; ALT > 2.5 times of 
upper limit of normal in 46 patients). Ultrasonography 
was carried out for the diagnosis of fatty liver (Philips 
iu22; C5-2 probe) by two medical sonographers, based 
on the following criteria: 1) enlarged liver, increase and 
intensification in echoes and bright spots (bright liver); 
2) unclear or absent intrahepatic blood vessels; 3) re￾duced or attenuated deep echoes. Patients who met the 
diagnostic criteria and had no history of drinking, acute 
fatty liver, drug-induced fatty liver, hepatitis B, and he￾patitis C were recruited for the present study.

Therapeutic regimen
Patients were divided into two age- and gender-ma￾tched groups. All the patients underwent lifestyle in￾terventions. In Group A, patients (n = 49) were treated 
with exenatide, and in Group B (n = 68), with metfor￾min. The therapeutic regimen was as follows: Group 
A: Exenatide injection (Eli Lilly and Company, USA) 
was administrated from week 1 to week 4 at 5 μg (bid), 
and from week 5 to week 12 at 10 μg (bid). Group B: 
metformin was initially administered at 0.5 g (bid). The 
dose of metformin (Sino-American Shanghai Squibb 
Pharmaceutical Ltd.) was adjusted to a maximum of 
2.0 g/d on the basis of FPG and 2-h PPG. 
Observations 
The measurement of height, body weight, waist-to-hip 
ratio and blood pressure, ultrasonography of the liver, 
gallbladder and spleen, and detection of HbA1c, FPG, 
2-h PPG, FIN, TG, HDL-C, LDL-C, Tch-C, ALT, 
AST, γ-GT, hs-CRP and adiponectin were done at ba￾seline and after 12 weeks of treatment. The hs-CRP 
was detected with Latex-enhanced immune turbidime￾tric method (Orion, Fineland), and serum adiponectin 
with radioimmunoassay (Linco, USA). Patients were 
re-examined after 4 weeks of the treatment, when FBG 
and 2-h PPG at each meal were measured. 
Statistical analysis 
Quantitative data were expressed as mean ± standard 
deviation ( ± SD). Statistical analysis was done with 
SPSS version 17.0. Means before and after treatment 
were compared between the two groups with indepen￾dent t test or rank sum test. Means before and after 
treatment in each group were compared with paired 
t test or rank sum test. Qualitative data were compa￾red with chi-square test. Two-sided P value of < 0.05 
was considered statistically significant. HOMA-IR was 
calculated as follow: fasting blood glucose vs. fasting 
blood insulin/22.5. 
RESULTS
Characteristics of patients at baseline
A total of 144 patients were recruited for the present 
study, and 27 of them withdrew from the study or were 
lost to follow-up. In the end, 117 patients completed 
this study. Mean age was 52.35 ± 11.83 years, mean 
body weight was 78.59 ± 11.03 kg, and mean body 
mass index (BMI) was 27.02 ± 4.43 kg/m2
. These pa￾tients were characterized by mild to moderate increase 
in ALT, AST and γ-GT, as well as reduction in AST/
ALT. 
At baseline, there were no marked differences in 
age, body weight, WHR, HbA1c, FPG, 2-h PPG, TG, 
HDL-C, LDL-C, Tch-C, ALT, AST, γ-GT, adiponec￾tin, and hs-CRP (Table 1).

Body weight and biochemical variables before and 
after treatment 
In both groups, body weight, BMI, WHR, HbA1c, 
FPG, 2-h PPG, HOMA-IR, ALT, AST, γ-GT, TG, and 
hs-CRP reduced significantly; HDL-C, LDL-C, and 
Tch-C remained unchanged; and AST/ALT and adi￾ponectin increased dramatically when compared with 
values observed before treatment. In the exenatide 
group, reductions in body weight (4.16 ± 5.32 vs. 1.98 
± 3.28), BMI (1.31 ± 0.98 vs. 0.69 ± 0.94), WHR (0.04 
± 0.02 vs. 0.02 ± 0.02), ALT (27.32 ± 15.96 vs. 12.85 ± 
11.38), AST (7.89 ± 7.8 vs. 75.11 ± 6.98), γ-GT (26.48 
± 17.34 vs. 10.26 ± 14.11), and hs-CRP (0.89 ± 0.59 
vs. 0.61 ± 0.54), and increases in AST/ALT (0.23 ± 
0.08 vs. 0.11 ± 0.09), adiponectin (1.86 ± 2.22 vs. 0.76 
± 1.30) and 2-h PPG (4.16 ± 3.01 vs. 2.63 ± 2.28) were 
HbA1c and ALT after treatment
After the 12-week treatment, the proportion of patients 
with HbA1c < 7% was comparable between two groups, 
but the proportion of patients with normal ALT level 
(< 40 U/L) in the exenatide group was significantly 
lower than in the metformin group. Re-examination re￾vealed that the percentage of patients with concomitant 
NAFLD in the exenatide group was slightly lower than 
in the metformin group, which might be related to the 
short-term treatment or small sample size (Table 4). 
DISCUSSION
With the elevation in the standard of living, prevalence 
of obesity and T2DM increases. Studies have shown 
that obesity may increase the risk of DM, as well as 
cardiovascular diseases and NAFLD. In clinical practi￾ce, we usually encounter patients that develop T2DM, 
obesity and NAFLD simultaneously (12,13). Insulin 
resistance may compromise the ability of insulin to

inhibit lipase, which leads to the increased degradation 
of peripheral adipose tissue and elevated free fatty acid. 
Then, oxidation and consumption of free fatty acid are 
insufficient, resulting in lipoylation of fatty acid into 
triglycerides, and increased triglyceride levels. Triglyce￾ride is then used to synthesize fat, which deposits in the 
liver, resulting in fatty liver. The deposition of fat in the 
liver may reduce the clearance of insulin in the liver, 
which aggravates the peripheral and hepatic insulin re￾sistance, resulting in a positive feedback amplification. 
Thus, hepatic insulin resistance has been regarded as 
an important characteristic of NAFLD. In addition, the 
imbalanced activities of adipocytokines might be a cau￾se of NAFLD progression after body weight loss and 
reduction in body fat. 
The adipose tissue is not only an important organ 
for energy storage, but also a key endocrine organ. It 
can produce some adipocytokines via autocrine and pa￾racrine mechamisms. Of these adipocytokines, leptin, 
adiponectin, resistin, tumor necrosis factor, and inter￾leukin have been found to be closely related to NAFLD. 
In addition, hs-CRP is another important inflammatory 
factor and has been regarded as a pivotal factor that can 
predict chronic inflammatory reaction, metabolic syn￾drome, and cardiovascular diseases (14). Adiponectin 
is one of proteins with high expression in the adipose 
tissues, which can inhibit inflammation. Arvaniti and 
cols. (15) found that hypoadiponectinemia could indu￾ce fat deposition in the liver and the progression of fatty 
hepatitis, and it is the most important adipocytokine in 
the initiation and progression of NAFLD. Thus, insu￾lin resistance, increase in inflammatory cytokines, such 
as hs-CRP, and reduction in adiponectin act synergis￾tically to promote the occurrence and development of 
T2DM and NAFLD. 
The majority of patients with NAFLD have no evi￾dent clinical symptoms and only present increase in 
ALT and/or AST. The mild to moderate increase in 
ALT and γ-GT and reduction in AST/ALT have been 
considered as characteristics closely related to NAFLD, 
T2DM, and metabolic syndrome (16). Currently, some 
studies reveal that NAFLD is closely related to the in￾creased risk of cardiovascular disease (17). In NAFLD 
patients, severe insulin resistance, sustained hyperinsu￾linism, disordered lipid metabolism (increase in TG, 
reduction in HDL-C, and elevation in LDL-C) and 
subclinical inflammatory state may serve as risk factors 
to promote the occurrence and development of athe￾rosclerosis (17,18). On the other hand, NAFLD may 
result in progressive hepatitis, hepatic fibrosis or cirrho￾sis, or even liver failure (19). Thus, for T2DM patients 
with concomitant NAFLD, therapy targeting insulin 
resistance may improve NAFLD. For example, body 
weight loss may not only reduce blood glucose, but 
may also be beneficial for blood pressure, blood lipids 
and the liver, leading to reduction in risk of cardiovas￾cular diseases. 
In previous therapies for T2DM (such as application 
with insulin and insulin secretagogues), hypoglycemia 
and body weight increase were usually encountered 
in clinical practice. In a large prospective study (AC￾CORD study), the investigators have proposed caution 
on the goal and safety of lowering glucose levels (20). 
In addition, previous therapies often fail to improve 
insulin resistance and have limitations in improving 
cardiovascular complications. Besides lifestyle interven￾tions, such as exercise and diet control, metformin and 
thiazolidinedione have been applied in the treatment 
of DM, but their therapeutic efficacy is not ideal. A 
recent meta-analysis reveals that lifestyle intervention 
is comparable to metformin in the improvement of li￾ver histology and hepatic enzymes in NAFLD patients 
(21). Thus, we pose the question if GLP-1 may be a 
promising anti-DM drug. 
Exenatide is an incretin analogue and can mimic 
the actions of GLP-1. For example, it can promote the 
glucose-dependent insulin secretion, inhibit the inap￾propriate secretion of glicentin, delay gastric emptying, 
and suppress appetite to reduce blood glucose and 
body weight (22). In a randomized, controlled study

on T2DM, exenatide was superior to insulin glargine 
in improving the risk factors of cardiovascular diseases 
(such as adiponectin and hs-CRP) (23). It is a question 
to be answered whether exenatide is superior to me￾tformin in improving NAFLD and related biochemical 
variables. 
In the present study, T2DM patients with NAFLD 
were recruited, and the effects of exenatide and me￾tformin on the blood glucose, NAFLD-related varia￾bles (such as ALT, AST, and γ-GT) were compared. In 
addition, ultrasonography was done to evaluate the fatty 
liver before and after treatment. Our results demons￾trated that exenatide was comparable to metformin in 
the reduction of blood glucose, but it was superior to 
metformin in reducing body weight, decreasing WHR, 
and improving hepatic enzymes. Although ultrasono￾graphy showed that the proportion of patients with im￾provement of fatty liver was comparable between two 
groups, possibly due to short term treatment and/or 
small sample size, exenatide had a slightly better ability 
to improve the fatty liver. HOMA-IR was employed to 
evaluate insulin resistance, and results did not indicate 
differences between the two groups. Thus, exenatide 
has special effect on the liver, which is different from 
metformin. Moreover, exenatide is better to control 2-h 
PPG when compared with metformin, and our results 
showed that serum adiponectin in patients treated with 
exenatide was higher than that in metformin-treated pa￾tients, but hs-CRP was reduced in exenatide-treated pa￾tients when compared with metformin-treated patients. 
Whether exenatide has a sustained effect in improving 
abdominal obesity or whether exenatide interrupts the 
vicious circle between insulin resistance and NAFLD 
is still unclear. The failure of metformin to improve 
NAFLD might be related to the absence of improve￾ment of adiponectin and hs-CRP, which suggests that 
metformin has no ability to improve oxidative stress in￾duced by fatty acid deposition and inflammation in the 
liver (24). The GLP-1 analogue may improve fatty liver 
and insulin resistance. This may be explained by the fact 
that GLP-1 may directly act on hepatocytes and activate 
the expression of genes related to the β-oxidation of 
fatty acids and insulin sensitivity (such as PPAR-γ and 
PPAR-α), which lead to the improvement of insulin re￾sistance in the NAFLD patients (25). 
Currently, exenatide treatment is costly, which sig￾nificantly limits its wide application in clinical practice. 
However, most of T2DM patients with abdominal obe￾sity develop NAFLD characterized by evident increase 
in ALT, which influences liver function, increases the 
risk for hepatic cirrhosis and liver failure, and limits the 
application of oral anti-diabetic drugs. In addition, ap￾plication of insulin may increase body weight. Thus, 
short term application of exenatide may interrupt this 
vicious cycle to control blood glucose, reduce body 
weight, and improve the liver function. 
Therefore, for T2DM patients with NAFLD, exena￾tide as a GLP-1 receptor agonist may not only reduce 
blood glucose and body weight, but also improve liver 
enzymes, attenuating NAFLD. For NAFLD, the im￾provement of liver histology is a gold standard in the 
evaluation of therapeutic efficacy. However, liver histo￾logy was not conducted in the present study. In future 
studies, long-term treatment with exenatide and a large 
sample size are required to confirm the effects of exena￾tide on NAFLD, insulin resistance, and atherosclerosis 
and to determine whether exenatide can be of benefit 
to NAFLD patients.
