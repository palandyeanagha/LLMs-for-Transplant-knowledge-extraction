Abstract
Background: Statins alter lipid concentrations. This systematic review determined the efficacy of
particular statins, in terms of their ability to alter cholesterol.
Review methods: PubMed, the Cochrane Library, references lists of reports, and reviews were
searched (September 2001) for randomised, double blind trials of statins for cholesterol in trials of
12 weeks or longer. Mean change in total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, and
triglycerides was calculated using pooled data for particular statins, and for particular doses of a
statin. Pre-planned sensitivity analyses were used to determine the effects of initial concentration
of total cholesterol, study duration, the effects of major trials, and effects in placebo versus active
controlled trials. Information was not collected on adverse events.
Results: Different statins at a range of doses reduced total cholesterol by 17–35% and LDL￾cholesterol by 24–49% from baseline. Lower doses of statins generally produced less cholesterol
lowering, though for most statins in trials of 12 weeks or longer there was at best only a weak
relationship between dose and cholesterol reduction. Duration of treatment and baseline total
cholesterol concentration did not alter the amount of the benefit attained.
Conclusions: Statins are effective medicines and confer benefit to patients in terms of primary and
secondary prevention of coronary heart disease. Reductions in total cholesterol of 25% or more
and LDL cholesterol of more than 30% were recorded for fixed doses of simvastatin 40 mg,
atorvastatin 10 mg, and rosuvastatin 5 mg and 10 mg.
Background
Cholesterol-lowering drug prescriptions have increased
seven fold in the last five years in the UK, with statins now
accounting for 92% of prescriptions and 95% of cost
(about €350 million a year in 2001) [1]. Simvastatin
(43%) and atorvastatin (32%) are the most commonly
prescribed. Long-term benefits are reduced heart attacks
and strokes [2-4]. Good evidence on primary and second￾ary prevention informs clinical decision-making, and
improves patient care.
Two large surveys, in Scotland in the 1990's and in Eng￾land in 1998 [5,6] identified large numbers of people
with total cholesterol above 5.0 mmol/L. The proportion
of Scottish individuals likely to require secondary preven￾tion with statins was 8% [6]. The English study [5]
revealed a high prevalence of dyslipidaemia, but fewer
than a third of subjects with established cardiovascular
disease received lipid altering drugs.

Evidence from major outcome studies, like 4S [3], helped
change practice. More people now have blood tests for lip￾ids after a heart attack, and most meet targets for lowered
cholesterol. This is just one factor underlying the improve￾ments, but there will be others, including more use of
aspirin, or beta-blockers or ACE-inhibitors, better cardiac
rehabilitation, and better primary care attention. It is not
just one piece of evidence, but many pieces of good evi￾dence used appropriately that continues to make a differ￾ence. In South Derbyshire [7] the chance of a 50-year old
man dying within the first year of a heart attack had fallen
by about 30% in 1999 compared with 1995, in part
because lipids were measured and statins initiated where
appropriate.
Randomised trials of statins are numerous. Though
reviews and meta-analyses have been conducted previ￾ously, few have segregated the literature according to
study methodology, dose, baseline total cholesterol, type
of patient, or duration of treatment [8,9], and those were
conducted before many later statin trials had been
reported. More recently Law and colleagues [10] have
examined dose-response for LDL cholesterol lowering
effects statins in studies lasting up to six weeks. This sys￾tematic review was conducted using information only
from randomised, double blind studies in the knowledge
that they were likely to be free of major sources of bias
[11,12]. The primary objective was to determine efficacy
in terms of changes in blood cholesterol in studies lasting
12 weeks or longer, that reflect the probable lifetime use
of these drugs once a prescription has been written. Sec￾ondary objectives were to examine the effects of duration
of treatment and initial concentration of total cholesterol
on efficacy. It was not our objective to examine major car￾diac events or survival. For completeness, information for
cerivastatin was included despite its withdrawal from the
market. For rosuvastatin, a statin in the early stages of its
development, information was available for 5 mg and 10
mg doses. Analyses were conducted before drug launch of
rosuvastatin in Europe. The approved dose in Holland is
rosuvastatin 10 mg daily.
Methods
QUOROM guidelines were followed [13].
Identification of studies
Randomised, double blind controlled trials assessing the
effect of statins on cholesterol in patients with hypercho￾lesterolaemia were sought. Pharmaceutical companies
known to manufacture statins were contacted for refer￾ences. The Cochrane Library (Issue 3, 2001), PubMed
(September 2001) and in-house files were searched for
relevant reports. Free text search terms used were 'statin',
'HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor', 'atorvastatin', 'cerivasta￾tin', 'fluvastatin', 'lovastatin', 'pravastatin', 'rosuvastatin',
'simvastatin', 'random*', 'double-blind', 'masked', 'dou￾ble-dummy', 'double-masked', 'trial', 'clinical trial',
'hyperlipideamia', 'hypercholesterolaemia', 'cholesterol',
'triglyceride(s)', and alternative spellings of the above.
Full journal publications of trials were sought with no lan￾guage restriction. Additionally, information from two tri￾als for rosuvastatin, unpublished at the time of the
searches, was provided by AstraZeneca UK. These studies
have since been published in full [14,15]. Reference lists
of retrieved trials and reviews were checked to identify
other studies.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Studies without baseline data were excluded, as were
those with fewer than 20 patients per treatment group.
Also excluded were trials with mean baseline concentra￾tion of total cholesterol below 5.0 mmol/L, combinations
of a statin plus another drug, trials examining patients
with familial hypercholesterolaemia, diabetes mellitus,
renal or hepatic pathology, or trials in which patients were
randomised to statin treatment within 24 hours of proce￾dures such as angioplasty or cardiac surgery.
Included trials were both randomised and double blind,
had at least two treatment groups (placebo, different
doses of the same statin, or different treatments), had a
mean total cholesterol of at least 5.0 mmol/L at baseline
(with or without dispersion), and provided baseline and
outcome data for total cholesterol, LDL, HDL and triglyc￾erides. Because trials of less than three months duration
are unlikely to adequately inform about sustainable
effects in terms of lipid lowering with statins, only those
of at least three months were included.
It was anticipated that patient information from major tri￾als may have been published more than once, in part or in
full, as information became available from longer use. For
each trial, the study that provided the fullest amount of
information was included in the systematic review and
any duplicated information excluded. Duplicate studies
were checked to ensure that relevant information for a
particular outcome described in an excluded study was
not missing from the included trial. No open-label infor￾mation extension was analysed.
Data extracted were (i) the statin, (ii) dose, (iii) study
duration, (iv) initial concentration of total cholesterol,
LDL, HDL and triglycerides, (v) mean change (absolute or
percent) from baseline during double blind treatment for
total cholesterol, LDL, HDL and triglycerides or data
allowing their calculation, (vi) number of patients achiev￾ing the LDL goal of less than 3.36 mmol/L, and (vii) infor￾mation on discontinuation. Baseline was regarded as the
mean of at least two pre-randomisation lipid assessments.

Trial quality
Each report which could possibly be described as a ran￾domised controlled trial was read independently by both
authors and scored using a commonly-used three item, 1–
5 score, quality scale [16]. The maximum score of an
included study was 5 and the minimum score was 2.
Analysis
Information was segregated by drug and dose. Dose titra￾tion studies, in which the daily dose of statin could be
increased to reach certain LDL goals or in which dose was
increased according to a schedule, were analysed sepa￾rately from those using fixed dosing regimens.
Not all trials reported both initial (baseline) and end￾point (or on treatment) outcome data. Those providing
baseline data were included regardless of whether out￾come data were provided for all relevant lipid outcomes.
For efficacy analyses, therefore, the number of trials or
patients for which information was available at baseline
and analysed for outcome data could differ.
Lipid concentrations were analysed as mmol/L and infor￾mation provided in mg/dL was converted to mmol/L. For
cholesterol, the value in mg/dL was multiplied by
0.02586. For triglyceride, the value in mg/dL was multi￾plied by 0.01129.
Efficacy outcomes were in the form of continuous data
such as mean change (or percent change) from baseline to
study end. Where a baseline value and percentage change
was given, the absolute change from baseline was calcu￾lated. Absolute baseline values and absolute mean
changes were calculated in mmol/L, weighting by treat￾ment group size, and the percentage change calculated
from the weighted means. Dichotomous outcomes pro￾vided were the number or percent of patients achieving
certain LDL goals, discontinuation for any reason, and
discontinuation because of adverse events.
When possible, patient information from different studies
was pooled. The objective was to enter any continuous
data in Review Manager (RevMan version 4.01; Update
Software, Oxford), to calculate weighted mean difference
from baseline for statin and for placebo, to generate
standard deviations or 95% confidence intervals, and to
determine statistical significance of differences between
treatments at various time points. This proved not to be
possible because few trials reported dispersion (standard
deviation, standard error, or interquartile range). In con￾sequence, no statistical analysis of differences between
different doses of a particular statin, or between different
statins, was possible. Instead, weighted mean values (by
group size) for continuous outcomes were calculated
without dispersion using Excel:mac 2001 on a Macintosh
G4.
Neither heterogeneity tests nor funnel plots were used
since they lack the power to reliably detect statistical het￾erogeneity or publication bias [17-19]. Instead, pre￾planned sensitivity analyses were conducted to detect pos￾sible variations in effect of study treatments.
Before the study began, several sensitivity analyses were
planned:
1. Effect of study duration on lipid changes. Information
for the most commonly used dose of a particular statin
was segregated by study duration.
2. Efficacy of different statins according to initial con￾centration of total cholesterol. To maximise the poten￾tial of this review studies with different mean baseline
total cholesterol were assessed, including those with lower
entry criteria for total cholesterol (i.e. less than 6.0 mmol/
L). Sensitivity analysis by baseline total cholesterol will
enable us to show whether the efficacy of statins varies
with differing baseline risk.
3. Effect of major statin trials. For several statins there
exist both small trials and much larger studies of generally
longer duration. Sensitivity analyses were conducted
including and excluding these large studies to determine
their influence on the pooled results for total cholesterol.
4. Results in active and placebo controlled trials. When
making indirect comparisons of treatment effect between
different trials use of a common comparator, often a pla￾cebo, is ideal. When placebo is absent, and another com￾parator is used it can be difficult to compare the effect of
treatment across different trials. Efficacy results for partic￾ular statins obtained from placebo controlled trials were
compared with those from trials using active comparators
to determine comparability of results.
Results
Searching
Forty-two reviews and 509 reports regarded as potential
randomised trials were retrieved. A number of trials were
published more than once, in part or in their entirety. Of
the potential trial reports, 418 were excluded (references
and reasons are in additional file 1). Many early trials
were of short duration or used an open label design and
were necessarily excluded from this analysis.
Reasons for exclusion of studies, including the mega-trials
mentioned above, were duration less than 12 weeks (89
reports), not double blind (55), fewer than 20 patients per
group (39), familial hypercholesterolaemia (22), no

cholesterol data (22 reports of 15 trials), duplicated infor￾mation (78 reports of 43 trials), add-on design or combi￾nation drug therapy (11), baseline data not provided by
treatment group (7), and various other reasons (95)
including failure of randomisation, inability to translate
or obtain reports, pooled analysis or reviews, trial in
progress, design only etc.
Of the statin mega-trials the following trials were
excluded:
• AFCAPS/TEXTCAPS did not provide baseline data split
by treatment group
• ALLHAT-LLT was an open label study
• ASCOT-LLA was ongoing at the time of the searches and
studied a subset of patients from the PROBE trial
• MIRACL studied patients who were hospitalised because
of unstable angina pectoris or non-Q wave acute myocar￾dial infarction
• PROBE had unblinded endpoints
• Since the date of searching the PROSPER trial has been
published. This trial is not included in the results for
pravastatin.
Ninety-one trials met the inclusion criteria and contrib￾uted to the analysis, with 43,404 patients on statins and
25,081 on placebo. Most patient information was availa￾ble for lovastatin, pravastatin and simvastatin, mainly
because of the publication of large, long-term trials [2,3],
with far less information available for atorvastatin, ceriv￾astatin, fluvastatin and rosuvastatin. Details of the indi￾vidual studies, including the baseline characteristics of
patients are shown in additional file 2 and outcome
results are shown in additional file 3. Most trials provided
an efficacy analysis based on the 'all patients treated
approach' meaning that patients with at least one baseline
assessment and one double blind on-treatment assess￾ment were included.
Of the statin mega-trials the following trials were
included:
• CARE
• EXCEL
• Heart Protection Study
• LIPID
• Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S)
• WOSCOPS
Trial characteristics
Patients in the trials were described mainly as hypercho￾lesterolaemic or having coronary artery disease or at risk
of coronary artery disease. General patient exclusions
from the included trials were secondary hyperlipidaemia,
uncontrolled diabetes or hypertension or angina, impair￾ment of renal or hepatic function, premenopausal women
unless surgically sterilised, recent myocardial infarction or
coronary bypass surgery (usually within 3 months of
study entry), previous substance abuse, excessive obesity
(more than 30% over ideal body weight), hypersensitivity
to HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, and use of corticoster￾oids or immunosuppressive drugs.
In all trials, eligible patients underwent a screening period
in which they ceased all lipid-lowering agents, followed a
defined diet (e.g. the American Heart Association step I or
II, or National Cholesterol Education Program diet) often
with dietary counselling, and started a single-blind pla￾cebo run-in. At the end of screening total cholesterol was
greater than 5.0 mmol/L, LDL cholesterol was greater than
4.0 mmol/L, and in most trials triglycerides less than 4.0
mmol/L. Baseline lipid measurements were generally a
mean of at least two assessments taken during the screen￾ing period.
Eligible patients were randomised to double blind statin
or control for the duration of the study and returned to
the clinic for periodic assessment. Double blind efficacy
data were presented as either the measurement at the last
observation, or the mean of all efficacy assessments over
the duration of the study. When treatments differed in
appearance or dosing double blinding of study treatments
was maintained using the double dummy technique. In
dose titration studies, in which the dose of treatment was
increased to achieve certain LDL targets, the number of
placebo tablets taken was increased in a similar way to
active treatment. Investigators were blind to treatment
and lipid results. Lipids were measured using standard
techniques, with most large, multicentre trials using one
or two central laboratories and quality control
procedures.
Studies were of generally high quality (additional file 2).
The minimum score possible for inclusion was 2 for ran￾domisation and double blinding. Three trials scored the
maximum of 5 points, 32 scored 4, 44 scored 3, and 12
scored 2.

Data available for analysis
Compliance with study treatment was reported to be
good, and ranged between 90% and 99% in the trials.
Table 1 summarises the amount of patient information
available for analysis for each statin. A number of trials
assessed more than one statin, and patients from these
studies appear in several rows of the Table. Common
comparator treatments in the trials were other statins,
gemfibrozil, bezfibrate and placebo. Results for statins
and placebo are described below; results for other compa￾rators in the individual trials are provided in additional
files 2 and 3. Doses used in the trials were either fixed for
the duration or were titrated, if required, in order to
achieve specified LDL cholesterol goals. Pooled results
combining information for all doses of the individual
statins for the cholesterol and triglycerides are shown in
Table 2. Similar information for particular doses is pro￾vided in additional file 4.
Dispersion information around reported mean values was
reported sporadically. Of 107 statin treatment arms, 79
(74%) reported dispersion at baseline and 45 (42%)
reported dispersion at end-point. Only 10/91 trials
reported the percentage of patients achieving LDL choles￾terol below 3.36 mmol/L. Only 30/91 trials reported dis￾continuations of treatment.
Atorvastatin
Five trials with 1,334 patients given atorvastatin 10 mg or
10–20 mg were included (Table 2 and additional file 4).
Study duration ranged between 12 weeks and one year.
Segregating data by dose made no difference to the results.
The analyses were based mainly on results for atorvastatin
10 mg (1107 patients).

mmol/L (17%, 18%) respectively. With 20–40 mg daily
initial concentration was 1.5 mmol/L and mean reduction
was 0.2 mmol/L (10%).
Placebo
Forty-seven trials compared a statin against placebo
(25,081 patients) over 12 weeks to 5 years. Results of the
analysis are shown in Table 2. The mean initial
concentration of total cholesterol was 6.2 mmol/L and the
mean reduction was 0.004 mmol/L (0.07%). The mean
initial LDL cholesterol was 4.1 mmol/L and the mean
reduction was 0.2 mmol/L (6%). The mean initial HDL
cholesterol was 1.1 mmol/L and the mean increase was
0.04 mmol/L (3%). The mean initial triglyceride concen￾tration was 2.0 mmol/L and the mean reduction 0.1
mmol/L (7%).
Sensitivity analyses
Sensitivity analyses were conducted using information for
the most commonly used dose of a particular statin in the
trials. These doses were atorvastatin 10 mg, cerivastatin
0.4 mg, fluvastatin 40 mg, lovastatin 40 mg, pravastatin
40 mg and simvastatin 40 mg. Information for both 5 mg
and 10 mg of rosuvastatin was used since patient numbers
were almost identical. For cerivastatin 0.4 mg was chosen
since it had been used in two trials, rather than using data
for 0.8 mg from a single trial for which there were more
patients.
Duration
Information was segregated according to the following
durations: 12–24 weeks, 25–52 weeks, and greater than
one year. Study duration appeared to have no effect on
lipid-altering capacity of the various statins (additional
file 5). The effect of duration on total cholesterol for all
statins and placebo trial arms is shown in Figure 5. Over
12 weeks placebo reduced total cholesterol by 0.3% with
no larger reduction over longer duration.
Initial concentration of total cholesterol
Information was segregated according to the following
average concentrations of mean total cholesterol at
baseline: 5.0 to 5.9, 6.0 to 6.9, 7.0 to 7.9, 8.0 to 8.9 and
9.0 to 9.9 mmol/L. In most trials initial average concentra￾tion of total cholesterol was between 6.5 and 7.8 mmol/L.
Only a few trials were conducted in patients with average
levels greater than 8.0 mmol/L. Initial average concentra￾tion of total cholesterol had no effect on the ability of stat￾ins to reduce total cholesterol (Table 3). Further analysis
of data for the most commonly used dose by both dura￾tion of treatment and initial total cholesterol concentra￾tion made no difference to the results.

Influence of major trials
Several major trials were included in the data sets for lov￾astatin, pravastatin and simvastatin. Change data for total
cholesterol was used to demonstrate the influence of these
major trials on the benefit attained by a particular statin
in the meta-analysis. No obvious difference in effect was
shown when these studies were analysed separately or
when they were excluded from the analysis (Table 4).
Placebo versus active controlled trials
For the most commonly used dose of each statin there was
no difference in reduction of total cholesterol in active or
placebo controlled trials (Table 5).
Discontinuations
Discontinuation rates for any cause, and because of
adverse events, are shown for each statin and for placebo
in Table 6. The amount of information was limited, and
differences in dose and duration make no comparison
possible. The all-cause discontinuation rate was about
10% and discontinuation because of adverse events was
about 4%.
Discussion
Meta-analysis of cholesterol reduction has tended to
focus, rightly, on the clinical outcomes of fatal and non￾fatal cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, and all￾cause mortality [20]. Few have examined the cholesterol
lowering effect of statins by drug and dose in longer dura￾tion studies. Kong et al [8], using similar inclusion and
exclusion criteria presented information on four statins
with 16,559 patients on statins. Hebert et al [9] looked at
cholesterol changes in studies with 29,008 patients, but
without analysing by statin and dose. Law and colleagues
[10] did analyse by drug and dose in 25,000 patients on
statins, but only in trials of two to six weeks duration. This

meta-analysis collates data from over 68,000 patients,
seven statins, and placebo, and in trials lasting at least 12
weeks, reflecting more the long term use of statins.
The value of any meta-analysis relies on the quality of
reporting of information in individual trials. Our
approach was to limit the analysis to trials of higher qual￾ity. We included only studies that were described as both
randomised and double blind, and the quality of
included studies was high. Of the 91 included trials 79
(87%) had quality scores of 3 or more out of a possible 5
using a validated quality score [16]. Studies of higher
reporting quality minimise bias [21]. We also omitted
studies shorter than 12 weeks to ensure changes in lipid
concentrations could be fully established, studies with
fewer than 20 patients per group, and studies in particular
clinical situations where effects of statins could be differ￾ent from that in a general practice population. Some lim￾itations in quality reporting remained, however. It could
be argued that open studies should have been allowed,
because blinding should not affect changes in an objective
response, like blood lipids. Our view was that including
open studies would have required additional sensitivity
analysis, and that with 43,000 patients treated with statins
and 25,000 treated with placebo there was a sufficiency of
data from studies of higher reporting quality.
Inconsistency in reporting of information hindered the
collation of information. Only a fraction of trials reported
the attainment of LDL goals, despite titration studies hav￾ing stated in the methods that doses could be doubled to
achieve these targets. Achieving cholesterol targets has
been shown to reduce the risk of coronary heart disease
and improve survival [22,23]. Results in trials that did
report this information varied, with between 3% and 82%
of patients achieving LDL cholesterol lower than 3.36
mmol/L. These effects were achieved over 12 weeks to one
year, so no long-term data on maintaining LDL
cholesterol below this threshold were available. A survey
of American physicians [24] examined achievement of
NCEP LDL targets in nearly 5000 dyslipidaemic patients
using dietary control or lipid lowering agents for at least
three months within a primary care setting. Approxi￾mately 40–50% of patients achieved their LDL target with
statins, with higher proportions of patients at low risk of
coronary heart disease achieving these goals [24].
Reporting of dispersion around mean outcome data
allows the reader to judge the characteristics of patients at
baseline and, similarly, the results for different outcomes.
Reporting of dispersion varied in terms of quality and
type. Dispersion was frequently reported for baseline
data, but reporting for outcome data was less common.
This reflects outcome data being reported in different
ways, like absolute (or percent) change from baseline, or
as an absolute value at the end of treatment. When trials
fail to report dispersion meta-analysts sometimes apply a
mean dispersion value to the studies lacking dispersion.
Dispersion can be derived from pooled data across all
trials reporting dispersion. Whether this is entirely appro￾priate for cholesterol has not, to our knowledge, been
demonstrated. When data sets include studies of disparate
size it is possible that using this technique could signifi￾cantly alter the results of the meta-analysis. Since this was
the case in the statin trials, pooled dispersion values were
not applied in this meta-analysis.
Most, but not all, trials reported the statistical significance
of lipid change from baseline for the different treatment
groups, but often with no reference to the statistical signif￾icance of differences between treatment groups. Knowing
that a particular statin can significantly reduce total cho￾lesterol over time is important, but of similar importance
is how it compares to other doses or different treatments
under the same conditions.
Information on premature discontinuation can inform
about issues like compliance, patient preference and toler￾ability of adverse events. The quality of reporting of infor￾mation on patients who discontinued treatment varied in
trials of statins, and some did not report this. Others pro￾vided some information, but often without reference to
numbers withdrawing in each treatment group. Knowing
how many patients discontinued (for any reason), and
those who discontinued because of adverse events
informs about the acceptability and tolerability of a
treatment.
Before starting the review we hypothesised that several
features of trial design might affect the outcome of choles￾terol lowering trials of statins. These were duration of the
trial, initial levels of blood lipids, the effect of major large
trials in wider populations being different from small
trials in selected populations, and results in active control￾led as opposed to placebo controlled trials. Sensitivity
showed that none of these variables affected the result.
Study duration varied widely in the trials, but did not
appear to impact on cholesterol lowering in trials for 12
weeks or longer. The major statin trials, such as 4S, the
MRC/BHF trial and WOSCOPS, have demonstrated the
sustainability of initial reductions in total and LDL choles￾terol over 3–5.5 years. These long-term benefits are
important for the reduction of major coronary events,
such as myocardial infarction and stroke. Placebo treat￾ment made no perceptible difference to blood lipid levels.
Patients in the trials underwent a period of dietary stabili￾sation before randomisation and continued the diet
throughout the study. The results for placebo help inform
on the effect of, or compliance with, dietary control. Die-

tary control alone may help maintain cholesterol levels,
but was unlikely to lower them in the long term.
Reductions in total and LDL cholesterol occurred irrespec￾tive of baseline total cholesterol. Sensitivity analysis
showed this to have little influence on benefit, though the
analysis excluded studies with mean total cholesterol
lower than 5.0 mmol/L. In general, trials with lower total
cholesterol (5.0–5.9 mmol/L) showed equivalent benefit
to those with higher concentrations. The exceptions were
the few trials in which patients had very high cholesterol
levels (greater than 9.0 mmol/L). This implies, as have
other trials [4] that patients with borderline hypercholes￾terolaemia may benefit from treatment.
Major statin trials had similar changes in lipid levels as did
smaller trials. Major trials, often conducted for clinical
rather than biochemical outcomes of statins, may have a
wider included population. That may be the case, but no
major difference of the effect of statins on these wider
populations, as opposed to more narrowly defined popu￾lations in smaller studies was apparent. Active controlled
and placebo controlled trials also had similar outcomes.
Another pre-planned analysis was for effects by dose of
statin. Inevitably, as the dose of a drug is increased a
greater amount of benefit is attained, though this is not
always the case above a certain dose. Early trials in the
clinical development of a drug may include doses below
or above the normal therapeutic range. Meta-analysis
should be sensitive to this, and to the clinical reality, that
dose is often titrated to effect [25]. Analysis by all doses
and by particular doses or regimens is a necessary part of
meta-analysis of all therapies.
Over the range of doses reported, all statins, with the
exception of pravastatin, showed some evidence of a dose
response for reduction in total and/or LDL cholesterol
with fixed dosing, but not with dose titration. The clearest
dose response was for fixed daily doses of lovastatin 20
mg, 40 mg or 80 mg for both total cholesterol and LDL,
and with simvastatin 20 mg or 40 mg daily there was a
weak dose-response for total cholesterol only. For the
other statins, most dose-specific analyses were based on
fewer than 1000 patients and, despite a trend for a dose￾response with fixed doses, their results were not robust
because of the limited size of the samples [26]. A meta￾analysis of studies conducted over two to six weeks [10]
demonstrated strong and linear dose-response relation￾ships for reduction of LDL cholesterol for fixed doses of
statins. There is no obvious reason for the apparent
difference in dose-response between shorter and longer
duration studies, and a more detailed re-examination of
all the studies would be required. The only possible rea￾son suggested by this analysis would be discontinuation
rates (Table 6), which were generally above 10% for stud￾ies lasting a year or more. Trials lasting six weeks would be
expected to have few discontinuations.
In dose titration studies, the dose of statin could be
increased up to daily maximum, either according to a pre￾scheduled incremental regimen (blue symbols in Figures
1,2,3,4), or to achieve specific reductions in LDL or total
cholesterol (red symbols in Figures 1,2,3,4). For no single
statin and dose range was there sufficient information to
assess whether either regimen achieved better results
because of limited numbers of studies and patients. Over￾all, however, there appeared to be no major difference
between these two dose titration regimens or use of a fixed
dose in the longer duration studies. There was no indica￾tion in the individual studies that patients who had been
recruited for dose titration studies differed in any way
from those who were recruited for fixed dose studies.
When using information from dose titration studies it is
important to know the mean or median daily dose of sta￾tin used. This was often not mentioned in the trials. This
information allows comparison of results across different
trials, including those from fixed dosing regimes as well as
other titration studies. Titration probably better reflects
what would occur in clinical practice, with patients being
prescribed a higher dose if their total cholesterol or LDL
remained higher than was desired. The existence of a dose￾response then becomes important because there is little
point recommending a higher daily dose unless this will
result in greater benefit. In none of the analyses did dose
titration produce convincingly greater reductions in total
cholesterol than seen with fixed doses (Figures 1,2,3,4).
What can a patient expect from treatment with a statin?
Our analysis showed that patients could expect a 17–33%
reduction in total cholesterol and a reduction in LDL cho￾lesterol of between 24–49%. Reductions in total choles￾terol of 25% or more and LDL cholesterol of more than
30% or more were recorded for fixed doses of simvastatin
40 mg, atorvastatin 10 mg, and rosuvastatin 5 mg and 10
mg. Simvastatin and atorvastatin are the most commonly
prescribed statins in the UK. Of the other statins, cerivas￾tatin has been withdrawn, and rosuvastatin has only
recently become available. Rosuvastatin produced the
largest reductions in total and LDL cholesterol at 5 mg or
10 mg, though involving relatively few patients (Figure 6).
Changes in blood lipid concentrations are surrogate
markers for clinical outcomes of protection from cardio￾vascular and cerebrovascular events, which were not
addressed in the analysis.
This, and other reviews have tried to quantify the benefits
achievable with statins. The unanswered question remain￾ing is that of their safety. Patients have to take statins for

the rest of their lives, and in these circumstances safety
becomes of major importance. This analysis did not
include adverse events, but the incidence of rare but seri￾ous adverse events is not usually captured by randomised
controlled trials. With statins there are two adverse events
that are well known; these are muscle and liver toxicity.
Myopathy is defined as muscle pain or weakness associ￾ated with creatine kinase levels more than 10 times the
upper limit of normal [27,28]. One report suggests the
risk of myopathy to be 1 in 1000 with statin
monotherapy, with the possibility of progression to rhab￾domyolosis and acute renal failure if the symptoms are
not recognised [27]. Liver toxicity is implicated by
transaminase increases greater than three times than the
upper limit of normal, and has been reported to occur in
about 1% of patients [27].
Conclusions
Statins are effective medicines and confer benefit to
patients in terms of primary and secondary prevention of
coronary heart disease through reduction in total and LDL
cholesterol. Generally, cholesterol lowering effects of stat￾ins were similar. Lower doses of statins generally pro￾duced less cholesterol lowering. Duration of treatment
and baseline total cholesterol concentration did not alter
the amount of the benefit attained. Better reporting of
information in published reports of clinical trials would
increase their utility and improve the clinical relevance of
meta-analysis.
