Abstract
Background: Proton radiotherapy has a dosimetric advantage over photon radiotherapy. Many retrospective studies
have shown promising results with proton radiotherapy in treating hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, clinical
evidence demonstrating the benefit of protons over photons is still limited. We therefore compared the clinical
outcomes of the two modalities using medical research databases from our medical foundation.
Methods: We conducted a propensity score-matched cohort study based on our multi-institution medical
organization research database. From January 2007 to January 2018, a total of 413 patients (photon: 349;
proton: 64) who were diagnosed with HCC and primarily treated with radiotherapy with curative intent were
enrolled. Overall survival (OS) and radiation-induced liver disease (RILD) were assessed. Stratified analysis was
also performed to evaluate the heterogeneous effects of the two arms.
Results: A total of 110 patients (photon: 55; proton: 55) were analyzed in the propensity-matched series. The
matched groups were balanced for baseline tumor risk factors. Cox regression analysis revealed a significant
survival benefit in the proton group (p = 0.032, HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.33–0.96). The median overall survival in the
proton group was not reached and that in the photon group was 17.4 months. The biological equivalent
dose of radiotherapy was significantly higher in the proton group than in the photon group (median, 96.56
Gray [relative biological effectiveness] vs. 62.5 Gray, p < 0.001). The risk of RILD was significantly lower in the
proton group (11.8% vs. 36%, p = 0.004).
Conclusions: Proton radiotherapy could deliver a higher radiation dose than photon radiotherapy without
increasing the risk of RILD and result in a better overall survival rate for those diagnosed with HCC and
treated with radiotherapy with curative intent.

Background
Radiotherapy is one of the crucial local treatment mo￾dalities for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The deliv￾ery of a higher radiation dose to the target has been
proven to result in better clinical outcomes [1–3]. How￾ever, the maximally tolerated dose for liver tumors is
limited by not only the surrounding radiosensitive liver
parenchyma but also the critical organs adjacent to the
tumor target [4]. Compared to conventional photon
radiotherapy techniques, proton radiotherapy offers
dosimetric advantages because of its superior physical
properties. A proton beam has a finite range of energy
deposition with no exit dose after the target. This phys￾ical advantage over photon beams could therefore re￾duce unwanted spreading of the dose to the surrounding
normal liver and adjacent organs [5]. Retrospective data
from eastern and western countries have shown promis￾ing clinical results for proton radiotherapy [6, 7]. The
three-year local control rate ranges from 70 to 95% de￾pending on the tumor and the patients’ baseline charac￾teristics, and the risk of toxicity is quite low.
There has only been one single-institution retrospect￾ive study, from the Massachusetts General Hospital
(MGH), comparing the clinical benefits of proton radio￾therapy over photon radiotherapy [8]. The study demon￾strates survival benefits with proton therapy, which may
be driven by a decreased incidence of radiation-related
liver decompensation. However, the baseline characteris￾tics of the two groups were not well balanced in the
study. Patients in the proton radiotherapy group tended
to have lower median Child-Pugh scores and better me￾dian albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) scores, which may raise
concern regarding selection bias. Therefore, in this
study, we investigated and compared the clinical out￾comes of the two modalities using medical research da￾tabases from our multi-institution medical foundation
with propensity score matching (PSM).
Methods
Data source
We conducted a retrospective analysis using deidentified
data retrieved from the Chang Gung Research Database
(CGRD). It is an electronic health record dataset derived
from the Chang Gung Medical Foundation, which con￾sists of a group of medical centers, regional hospitals,
and local hospitals and provides approximately 13–14%
of the cancer healthcare services in Taiwan [9]. Among
them, two medical centers and two regional hospitals
provide photon radiotherapy services. Cyclotron-based
proton radiotherapy was available at one of the medical
centers during the study period. This study was ap￾proved by the institutional review board (IRB) of the
Chang Gung Medical Foundation (reference number
201901651B0).
Study population
Patients diagnosed with HCC and receiving local radio￾therapy as a primary curative treatment modality be￾tween January 2007 and January 2018 were included in
the study. To exclude patients treated with palliative
intent, we excluded patients with an unknown stage, dis￾tant metastasis, or a biological equivalent dose (BED)
below 50 Gray (Gy). The BED was calculated using an α/
β value of 10 Gy. For proton radiotherapy, a relative bio￾logical effectiveness (RBE) value of 1.1 was used. The
type of radiotherapy was further identified to group pa￾tients receiving photon and proton radiotherapy. Patients
whose radiotherapy was not initiated within 3 months after
diagnosis, received mixed photon and proton radiotherapy,
or received isotope or brachytherapy were also excluded
(Fig. 1).
Covariates
Baseline variables considered in the analyses included
patient age, sex, clinical American Joint Committee on
Cancer (AJCC) stage, liver fibrosis score (Ishak scale),
tumor differentiation, hepatitis B status, hepatitis C sta￾tus, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) status, ALBI grade, Child￾Pugh class, tumor number, size of the largest tumor, and
portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT) status. AJCC stage
data were originally coded according to the 6th, 7th, or
8th edition depending on the year of the diagnosis and
were all transformed to be in accordance with the 8th
edition for the analysis.
Outcomes
The primary outcome of this study was the overall sur￾vival (OS) of patients who were diagnosed with HCC
and treated primarily with proton radiotherapy or pho￾ton radiotherapy with curative intent. OS was defined
from the date of diagnosis to the date of death as a result
of any cause. Radiation-induced liver disease (RILD) was
also assessed to determine the toxicity of the treatment.
There are two types of RILD. A patient who presented
with anicteric hepatomegaly, ascites, and elevated alka￾line phosphatase (more than twice the upper limit of
normal or baseline value) 2 weeks to 3 months after ther￾apy was defined as classic RILD positive. A patient
whose liver transaminase levels were elevated more than
five times the upper limit of normal (or more than
twenty times the upper limit of normal in patients with
baseline values more than five times the upper limit of
normal) or whose Child-Pugh score worsened by two or
more within 3 months after the completion of radiother￾apy was defined as nonclassic RILD positive [10].
Statistical analysis
PSM was applied to reduce selection bias between the
study groups. Sex, age, clinical AJCC stage, liver fibrosis

score, tumor differentiation, hepatitis B status, hepatitis
C status, AFP status, ALBI grade, Child-Pugh class,
tumor number, size of the largest tumor, and PVTT sta￾tus were selected as independent variables. Using NCSS
10 Statistical Software (LLC, Kaysville, Utah, USA), the
greedy method was used for matching at a 1:1 ratio be￾tween the study groups with a caliper width 0.2-fold the
standard deviation of the propensity score between the
study groups. The standardized mean difference (SMD)
was used to evaluate covariate balance after PSM.
To compare the groups, we used the Pearson chi￾square test or Fisher’s exact test for categorical vari￾ables and the Student t-test or Mann-Whitney test
for continuous variables depending on the result of
the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for normality. OS was
assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method and the Cox
regression model. Stratified analyses for OS were
performed to assess the heterogeneous effects of pro￾ton and photon radiotherapy. A two-sided p-value of
< 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All stat￾istical analyses were performed using SPSS statics v
25.0 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, USA) unless otherwise
noted.
Results
Patient characteristics
A total of 12,937 patients diagnosed with HCC were
identified. A total of 413 patients met the inclusion cri￾teria and were analyzed (photon: 349 patients, proton:
64 patients) (Fig. 1). Compared with patients who re￾ceived photon radiotherapy, at the patient level, those
treated with proton radiotherapy tended to be older
(mean age, 65.53 years vs. 60.38 years, p = 0.002), with
more cases of hepatitis B or C infection (59.4% vs. 47.6%
for hepatitis B, p = 0.001; 31.2% vs. 23.1% for hepatitis C,
P = 0.001) and a higher liver fibrosis score (75.0% vs.
66.2% for Ishak F5–6) but better liver function (92.2%
vs. 58.5% for Child-Pugh class A, p < 0.001; 37.5% vs
22.9% for ALBI grade 1, p < 0.001). At the tumor level,
those treated with proton radiotherapy had an earlier
clinical AJCC stage (40.6% vs. 9.2% for stage I/II and
31.6% vs. 79.9% for stage III, p < 0.001), lower AFP level
(54.7% vs. 36.4% for AFP < = 200 ng/mL, p < 0.001), and
fewer cases of PVTT (37.5% vs. 78.8%, p < 0.001).
After 1:1 PSM, 110 patients were analyzed (photon: 55
patients, proton: 55 patients). The baseline characteris￾tics were balanced in the matched groups (SMD < 0.2

and p > 0.05 for all variables). Patient characteristics be￾fore and after matching are presented in Table 1.
Survival
Cox regression analysis revealed a significant survival
benefit in the proton group both before (p < 0.001, HR
0.29, 95% CI 0.19–0.45) and after PSM (p = 0.032, HR
0.56, 95% CI 0.33–0.96) (Fig. 2). The median OS in the
photon group was 9.4 months and 17.4 months before
and after PSM, respectively. The median OS in the pro￾ton group was not reached before or after matching.
Stratified analyses of OS in the matched cohort are
presented in Fig. 3. The trend of the survival benefit of
proton radiotherapy was consistent across all subgroups,
and no significant heterogeneity in the HR was
observed.
BED and RILD
The BED was significantly higher in the proton group
than in the photon group (median, 96.56 (96.56–96.56)
Gy (RBE) vs. 62.5 (58.5–76.2) Gy, p < 0.001). Among 110
patients in the PSM series, 101 patients had sufficient
data available to evaluate RILD (photon: 50; proton: 51).
There were 18 and 6 nonclassic RILD patients in the
photon and proton groups, respectively. No classic RILD
was recorded in either group. The risk of RILD was sig￾nificantly lower in the proton group (11.8% vs. 36%, p =
0.004). The distribution of the BED and cases of RILD is
presented in Fig. 4.
Discussion
Clinical data comparing proton and photon radiotherapy
with curative intent for HCC are limited. In the present
study, we found that after appropriately adjusting for
prognostic variables, patients who received proton radio￾therapy had significantly better OS, which may be driven
by a higher BED and lower risk of RILD.
These results echo those of the MGH report [8]. The
study demonstrates survival benefits with proton ther￾apy, which may be related to the decreased incidence of
nonclassic RILD. It is always challenging for retrospect￾ive studies to minimize selection bias, especially when
studying liver tumors, as both tumor characteristics and
patients’ baseline liver function play a significant role in
survival outcomes [11]. The strength of the present
study is the balanced variables after PSM. We matched
not only tumor variables but also baseline liver function
variables that could potentially affect radiation toxicity
and outcomes, including the liver fibrosis score, Child￾Pugh class, ALBI grade, and hepatitis infection status
[10, 12]. Moreover, we only included patients who
underwent radiotherapy as the primary treatment mo￾dality after diagnosis, therefore precluding the effect of
previous treatment modalities, such as radiofrequency
ablation (RFA), surgery, or chemotherapy. The disease
entity is also quite different between the present study
and the MGH report. Our patients presented with more
advanced HCC with larger tumors (median diameter of
6.8 cm for the largest tumor vs. median gross tumor
volume of 106 ~ 118 mL) and a higher ratio of multiple
tumors (56.4 ~ 60% vs. 36 ~ 49%), HBV infection (61.8 ~
65.5% vs. 5 ~ 12%), and tumor thrombosis (43.6 ~ 47.3%
PVTT vs. 27 ~ 35%), which may have influenced the
BED that could be safely delivered by photon radiother￾apy, which is much lower in the present study than in
the MGH report (median, 62.5 Gy vs. 80.4 Gy [RBE]).
For liver tumors, it has been well demonstrated that a
higher radiation dose could result in better oncological
outcomes. The prescribed dose varies among series de￾pending on the tumor entity, radiotherapy technique,
and combined treatment modalities. In the era of 3D
conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT), Park et al. analyzed
158 HCC patients and found that a higher radiation dose
predicted a better tumor response rate (29.3% for < 40

Gy; 68.6% for 40–50 Gy, and 77.1% for > 50). However,
the radiation dose also seemed to be a determining fac￾tor for RILD (4.2% for < 40 Gy; 5.9% for 40–50 Gy, and
8.4% for > 50 Gy) [3]. Among patients with PVTT who
were treated with 3DCRT, Toya et al. reported a better
response rate (80.0% vs. 21.7%, p < 0.001) and 1-year
survival rate (59.3% vs. 29.2%, p = 0.04) for those who re￾ceived BED ≥58 Gy [2]. In the era of intensity-modulated
radiotherapy (IMRT), the radiation dose could be esca￾lated safely by advanced techniques. Byun et al. analyzed
637 patients with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC)
stage C HCC who received IMRT with concurrent hep￾atic arterial 5-fluorouracil. A higher BED (≥72 Gy) sig￾nificantly increased the 1-year local failure-free survival
(95% vs. 78%; p = 0.008) and 1-year OS (62% vs. 51%;
p = 0.03) rates [1]. Chadha et al. reported a series of 46
HCC patients treated with proton radiotherapy. Patients
receiving a BED ≥90 Gy (RBE) had significantly better
OS [7]. In the present study, the BED was significantly
higher in the proton group and would be an essential
factor contributing to better OS.
RILD is a major concern of using radiotherapy to treat
liver tumors. The risk of RILD may be related to the
liver radiation dose, the dose distribution, and under￾lying liver disease [13]. Investigations have tried to issue
dose parameters to predict the risk of RILD [14]. In the
Quantitative Analyses of Normal Tissue Effects in the
Clinic (QUANTEC) report, Charlie et al. recommended
that for those receiving therapeutic partial liver radio￾therapy, keeping the mean normal liver dose (liver

minus gross tumor volume) < 28 Gy for primary liver
cancer and < 32 Gy for liver metastases may reduce the
risk of RILD to < 5% [10]. Although advanced radiother￾apy techniques such as IMRT or volumetric modulated
arc therapy (VMAT) could achieve more conformal tar￾get dose coverage and a higher target dose than 3DCRT,
the low-dose region may be increased by the nature of
the physical properties of X-rays. The increase in the
low-dose region in the normal liver could potentially in￾crease the risk of RILD. Son et al. reported an analysis of
72 patients treated with helical tomotherapy and hypo￾fractionated radiotherapy (40–50 Gy in 10 fractions).
Normal liver receiving a dose of more than 15 Gy (V15)
was found to be a parameter capable of predicting the
deterioration of hepatic function [15]. Moreover, dosi￾metric studies have found that for liver tumors larger
than 8 cm, IMRT or VMAT delivered a higher mean
liver dose than 3DCRT [16]. These findings highlight the
difficulties of using photon radiotherapy to treat large
liver tumors optimally.
The story could be changed by the superior physical
properties of proton radiotherapy. A proton beam has a
finite range of energy deposition with no exit dose after
the target. This physical advantage, compared with pho￾ton beams, may allow a higher target dose to be
achieved without the unwanted spread of low doses to
the surrounding normal liver. In a dosimetric study,
Wang et al. demonstrated that for liver tumors, proton
radiotherapy could significantly lower the mean liver
dose and volume of normal liver receiving a dose of
more than 30 Gy (RBE) (V30) compared to photon radio￾therapy [5]. Toramatsu et al. also performed a dosimet￾ric study to compare spot-scanning proton therapy
(SSPT) and IMRT. They predicted the risk of RILD
using the Lyman-normal-tissue complication probability
model and found that the risk of RILD increased drastic￾ally between with IMRT but not SSPT for liver tumors
6.3–7.8 cm in diameter (RILD 94.5% for IMRT vs. 6.2%
for SSPT for tumor size > 6.3 cm), which indicated that
HCC lesions could be more safely treated with proton

therapy, especially HCC lesions greater than 6.3 cm in
size [17]. Moreover, patients with small normal liver vol￾umes may potentially benefit from proton radiotherapy.
Lee et al. analyzed 22 HCC patients with a small normal
liver volume (< 800 cm3
) who were treated with proton
radiotherapy. The oncological results were a 1-year in￾field local control rate of 95.5% and a 1-year OS rate of
81.8%; there were no cases of liver failure, and only one
case of nonclassic RILD could be identified [18]. In the
present study, 83.4% (n = 92) of the patients included in
the PSM series had multiple tumors or a largest tumor
size > 5 cm, and the risk of RILD would therefore be
high with photon radiotherapy. Nonetheless, with proton
radiotherapy, albeit with a higher BED, the risk of RILD
was significantly lower, which is attributed to the advan￾tages of its physical properties.
The dose schemas used in the proton cohort are
mainly modified from Proton Medical Research Center
(Tsukuba, Japan) protocols [19]. Briefly, 72.6 Gy (RBE)
in 22 fractions or 66 Gy (RBE) in 10 fractions were pre￾scribed, depending on the tumor location. The 72.6 Gy
(RBE) protocol is preferred for tumors located within 2
cm of the gastrointestinal tract or porta hepatis. The
physical advantage of the proton beam, which minimizes
unwanted spreading of the dose to the surrounding nor￾mal liver, was that the prescribed doses in the proton co￾hort were quite uniform and mostly did not need to be
tailored for large tumor volume HCC cases. On the con￾trary, in the photon cohort, large tumor volume may be
an essential factor that resulted in higher unwanted
doses spreading to the normal liver and therefore limited
the tolerance of the prescribed dose. Consequently, pho￾ton dose prescriptions need to be tailored case by case
for different tumor sizes or locations; therefore, the pre￾scribed doses in the photon cohort were more diverse
and lower than those in the proton cohort.
Our study does have potential limitations. Limited by
the nature of the CGRD, we could only record the “size
of the largest tumor” instead of the “total tumor vol￾ume.” Although the “size of the largest tumor” has been
demonstrated to predict survival outcomes for HCC pa￾tients undergoing liver transplantation [20], this may re￾sult in uncertainties when assessing patients with
multiple HCC lesions. The location of HCC is also an

essential factor contributing to the dosimetric difference
between photon and proton radiotherapy [21] and could
not be addressed in the present study. Although we gen￾erated balanced groups according to several variables by
PSM, potential selection bias is still present due to the
retrospective nature of the study. Patients treated with
proton radiotherapy in our series were all treated at a
single medical center, while patients treated with photon
radiotherapy were treated at four different hospitals.
There may be a bias related to differences in protocols
and treatment techniques among different hospitals.
Economically, photon therapy is covered by National
Health Insurance (NHI) in our country, while proton
therapy is an expensive technique not covered by NHI.
This may lead to potential selection bias regarding socio￾economic status between the groups.
Conclusions
In this propensity-matched analysis, we demonstrated
that compared to photon radiotherapy, proton radiother￾apy could deliver a higher radiation dose without in￾creasing the risk of RILD and result in a better overall
survival rate for those diagnosed with HCC and treated
with radiotherapy with curative intent. The physical ad￾vantages of proton therapy allow it to be used to treat
HCC safely and potentially improve OS. Prospective in￾vestigations are needed to assess the role of proton
radiotherapy in treating liver tumors.
