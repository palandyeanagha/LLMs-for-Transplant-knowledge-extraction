Background: The response rates and duration of peginterferon alpha (PEG-IFN-a) and ribavirin
combination therapy in chronic hepatitis C genotype 4, the prevalent genotype in the Middle East and
Africa, are poorly documented.
Aims: To compare the efficacy and safety of 24, 36, or 48 weeks of PEG-IFN-a-2b and ribavirin therapy
in chronic hepatitis C genotype 4.
Methods: In this prospective, randomised, double blind study, 287 patients with chronic hepatitis C
genotype 4 were randomly assigned to PEG-IFN-a-2b (1.5 mg/kg) once weekly plus daily ribavirin
(1000–1200 mg) for 24 weeks (group A, n = 95), 36 weeks (group B, n = 96), or 48 weeks (group C,
n = 96) and followed for 48 weeks after completion of treatment. Early viral kinetics and histopathological
evaluation of pre- and post treatment liver biopsies were performed. The primary end point was viral
clearance 48 weeks after completion of treatment.
Results: Sustained virological response was achieved in 29%, 66%, and 69% of patients treated with PEG￾IFN-a-2b and ribavirin for 24, 36, and 48 weeks, respectively, by intention to treat analysis. No
statistically significant difference in sustained virological response rates was detected between 36 and
48 weeks of therapy (p = 0.3). Subjects with sustained virological response showed greater antiviral
efficacy (e) and rapid viral load decline from baseline to treatment week 4 compared with non-responders
and improvement in liver histology. The incidence of adverse events was higher in the group treated for
48 weeks.
Conclusion: PEG-IFN-a-2b and ribavirin for 36 or 48 weeks was more effective in the treatment of chronic
hepatitis C genotype 4 than treatment for 24 weeks. Thirty six week therapy was well tolerated and
produced sustained virological and histological response rates similar to the 48 week regimen.
T
he WHO has estimated that 170 million people world￾wide are infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). Reports
indicate that the prevalence rates for anti-HCV ranges
from 0.5–1% in low prevalence areas such as North America
to .20% in high prevalence areas such as Egypt.1 2 Acute
infection with HCV is followed by chronic infection in 80% of
cases with increased risk for liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular
carcinoma.3 4
HCV genotype differences are of considerable clinical
significance because they affect responses to antiviral
therapy. Genotype 4 predominates throughout the Middle
East and parts of Africa,1 5 often in association with a high
population prevalence as in Egypt,6–8 and exists to a lesser
extent in other areas, such as southern Europe and the
USA.9 10 More than 90% of Egyptian HCV isolates belong to
genotype 4.5–8 Phylogenetic analysis of the complete genomic
sequence of genotype 4 revealed a closer relationship between
genotype 4 and genotype 1 than with other genotypes, as
evidenced by the short branch and slightly greater degree of
nucleotide sequence similarity between genotypes 1 and 4
than that found between other genotypes.5 11 Subtype 4a is
the dominant Egyptian HCV strain but other subtypes
(provisionally named 4a, 4b, and 1g) are also present at a
lower prevalence rate.12
Earlier reports showed that patients infected with HCV
genotype 4 (HCV-4) respond to conventional interferon alpha
(IFN-a) as poorly as those infected with genotype 1.13 14
Pegylated (PEG)-IFN-a plus oral ribavirin became the current
standard of care for chronic hepatic C due to the higher
efficacy of PEG-IFN based regimens in inducing improved
sustained virological responses (SVRs) compared with IFN-a
plus ribavirin.15–17 Recent reports showed that the duration of
therapy should be individualised according to genotype as
patients infected with genotype 1 require treatment for
48 weeks and those with HCV genotypes 2 or 3 seem to be
adequately treated for 24 weeks.16–18 To date, the efficacy and
appropriate duration of PEG-IFN-a and ribavirin therapy
have not been evaluated. Therefore, we prospectively
compared the effectiveness and safety of 24, 36, or 48 weeks
of treatment with PEG-IFN-a-2b and ribavirin for initial
treatment of patients with genotype 4 chronic HCV infection.

criteria for chronic hepatitis C in liver biopsy performed
within the preceding year with no signs of cirrhosis or
bridging fibrosis on pretreatment liver biopsy.
Patients were excluded during screening for any of the
following reasons: previous IFN-a therapy; other liver
diseases such as hepatitis A, hepatitis B, schistosomiasis,
autoimmune hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, drug induced
hepatitis, or decompensated liver disease; coinfection with
schistosomiasis or human immunodeficiency virus; neutro￾penia (,1500/mm3

transplant; neoplastic disease; severe cardiac or pulmonary
disease; unstable thyroid dysfunction; psychiatric disorder;
current pregnancy or breast feeding; or therapy with
immunomodulatory agents within the last six months.
Study design
This was a randomised, double blind, multicentre study
comparing the efficacy and safety of 24, 36, or 48 weeks of
PEG-IFN-a-2b plus ribavirin as initial treatment of patients
with proven chronic HCV genotype 4 infection. The study was
conducted at four Egyptian centres. Enrolment began in
January 2002 and the trial was completed in May 2004.
Informed written consent was obtained from each patient.
The study protocol was approved by the institutional review
boards at each centre and was conducted according to the
ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki.
The study was conducted using intention to treat (ITT)
analyses, defined as inclusion of patients who received at
least one dose of any study medication. A total of 335
patients were initially screened; 48 patients were excluded
from the study because they did not meet the inclusion
criteria (fig 1). Hence 287 patients fulfilled the inclusion
criteria and were randomly assigned to receive PEG-IFN-a-2b
(PEG-Intron; Schering Corp., Kenilworth, New Jersey, USA)
at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg each week plus ribavirin (Rebetol;
Schering Corp.) at a dose 10.6 mg/kg/day for 24 weeks
(group A, n = 95), 36 weeks (group B, n = 96), or 48 weeks
(group C, n = 96). Compliance was assessed by monitoring
empty PEG-IFN-a-2b vials and used returned syringes. PEG￾IFN-a-2b and ribavirin doses were discussed and carefully
reviewed with patients at each visit to ensure that the
regimens were being followed. All treated subjects were
followed for 48 weeks after completion of therapy.
Assessment and end points
Clinical and biochemical laboratory values (serum ALT,
aspartate transaminase, albumin, bilirubin concentrations,
and prothrombin time) were determined before initiation of
therapy, at entry, at weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12, and monthly
thereafter until the end of follow up. HCV genotype was
determined with the line probe assay (Inno-LiPA;
Innogenetics NV, Zwijnaarde, Belgium). Efficacy was
assessed by measuring HCV RNA in serum and serum

aminotransferases. All subjects who received at least on dose
of PEG-IFN-a-2b plus ribavirin were included in the efficacy
analysis.
The primary efficacy end point was SVR (defined as
undetectable levels of HCV RNA on analysis with Cobas
Amplicor HCV version 2.0, with a lower limit of detection of
100 copies/ml at the end of follow up). Secondary end points
included virological response over time. Early virological
response (EVR) was defined as undetectable HCV RNA serum
levels (,50 IU/ml) or a minimum 2 log10 decrease from
baseline in HCV RNA at week 12. EVR was correlated with
SVR in order to assess its predictive value. End of treatment
response (ETR) was defined as undetectable HCV RNA serum
levels (,50 IU/ml) at the end of the scheduled treatment
period
Assessment of safety
Safety was assessed by recording adverse events in the three
studied groups, as reported by patients, by clinical and
laboratory test results (including haematology, blood chem￾istry, thyroid function tests, and urinalysis), and by vital data
at weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12, monthly thereafter during
treatment, and at the end of therapy and follow up. Patients
who discontinued therapy prematurely because of intoler￾ance were encouraged to remain in the study. Stepwise
reductions in PEG-IFN-a-2b or ribavirin dose were allowed to
manage adverse events or laboratory abnormalities that had
reached predetermined thresholds of severity. If the adverse
event resolved or improved, a return to initial dosing levels
was permitted unless the patient had received the reduced
dose for more than four weeks. Patients were withdrawn
from treatment if they missed four consecutive doses.
Assessment of HCV kinetic parameters
Viral decline for all patients was analysed using a mathema￾tical model and methods describing the dynamic relationship
between uninfected target cells (T), infected hepatocytes (I),
and free virions (V). These models assume rates for clearance
of free virus (c), infected cell loss (d), virus production (p),
and de novo infection (b).19 Early effectiveness of the
treatment at inhibiting viral production is modelled by
efficiency factors (e) and g on virus production and on de
novo infection, respectively, and was assumed to start after a
short delay time (t0). A further immunological effect was
modelled by an inflation factor M >1 on infected cell loss,
occurring after a delayed time point (t1). Pretreatment
infected cell loss (d) changes to Md, which results in a
triphasic viral decay. This triphasic model was used to fit data
for the first four weeks for individual kinetic parameters, as
previously reported.20
Liver histology
Paired liver biopsies were performed for all patients. Liver
biopsies were obtained within six months of enrolment and
at the end of the post treatment observation period. Liver
biopsies were stained with haematoxylin-eosin and a con￾nective tissue stain (chromotrope aniline blue). Liver biopsies
were read by two pathologists in a blinded fashion adopting
the grading and scoring system proposed by Ishak and
colleagues21 which includes grading of piecemeal necrosis,
confluent necrosis, apoptosis, focal inflammation, and portal
inflammation, with a score ranging from 0 to 18 and a
staging score ranging from 0 to 6, with different extents of
fibrosis.
Statistical analysis
Efficacy analyses were performed using an ITT population,
defined as all enrolled patients who received at least one dose
of any study medication. Two sided 95% confidence intervals
(CIs) were calculated for each efficacy variable, expressed as
per cent of patients. The global hypothesis of no differences
among the three treatment groups was tested at a signifi￾cance level of 0.05; if there was a significant difference
among the three treatment groups, each treatment compar￾ison was then tested at a significance level of 0.05. Treatment
responses were compared with the use of Fisher’s exact test.
Predictors of the treatment response were examined by
stepwise logistic regression analysis or multivariate Cox
regression analysis. For histological responses, scores were
calculated before and after treatment, and the changes in
scores were compared with the use of the Wilcoxon rank sum
test. All reported p values are two sided.
RESULTS
Baseline characteristics of the patients
Of 335 patients screened, 48 patients were excluded from the
study because they did not meet the inclusion criteria, while
287 patients (150 males and 137 females; mean age 42.0
(9.5) years) fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were randomly
assigned to the three treatment schedules and received at
least one dose of the study medication (fig 1). Eight patients
were excluded after receiving one or two doses because they
refused to continue therapy or did not come for treatment.
Apart from the eight patients who were excluded early in the
study, three patients discontinued therapy before week 24,
and two patients (group B, n = 1; group C, n = 1) withdrew
after week 24. Another three subjects in group C withdrew
after 36 weeks (fig 1). The most common reason for
discontinuation of therapy was adverse events in the form
of haematological complications, followed by depression, not
improved by dose modification. A total of 271 patients (90
subjects in group A, 90 in group B, and 91 in group C)
completed the proposed therapy protocol. The three groups
were comparable with respect to baseline characteristics
(table 1). All patients were infected with HCV genotype 4.
Outcome of therapy
At the end of treatment (ETR), viral clearance was achieved
in 45/95 subjects treated for 24 weeks (48%) versus 65/96
patients (68%) treated for 36 weeks and 67/96 patients (70%)
treated for 48 weeks (p = 0.04 between groups A and B;
p = 0.02 between groups A and C; p = 0.4 between groups B
and C) (fig 2A). SVR (that is, no detectable HCV RNA
48 weeks after completion of therapy) was achieved in 28/95
(29%), 63/96 (66%), and 66/96 (69%) patients treated with
PEG-IFN-a-2b and ribavirin for 24, 36, and 48 weeks,
respectively (p = 0.001 between groups A and B; p = 0.001
between groups A and C; p = 0.5 between groups B and C)
(fig 2A). Significantly more patients treated with long
duration PEG-IFN-a-2b plus ribavirin (36 and 48 weeks)
had an SVR than those treated with PEG-IFN-a-2b plus
ribavirin for 24 weeks (66% and 69% v 29%; p,0.001)
(fig 2A). Virological relapse was highest in patients treated
for 24 weeks (n = 20) compared with longer treatment
periods (relapse: n = 2 with 36 week group and n = 1 with
48 week group) suggesting that at least 36 weeks of PEG￾IFN-a-2b plus ribavirin is required for treatment of patients
with chronic hepatitis C genotype 4 to maintain an SVR.
Dividing the results further according to pretreatment viral
RNA levels showed that among patients with high pretreat￾ment viral RNA levels (.2 million copies/ml) who achieved
SVR, 65% received PEG-IFN-a-2b plus ribavirin for 48 weeks
and 35% received the 36 week schedule (p = 0.04), while
none belonged to the 24 week group, suggesting that
48 weeks of therapy might be more appropriate for those
with high pretreatment HCV-RNA titres.

Early virological response
We examined the significance of undetectable levels of
HCV RNA at 12 weeks as a predictor of SVR. An EVR,
defined as a reduction in the HCV RNA level by at least 2 log
IU/ml (on a base 10 scale) at 12 weeks, has been shown in
our study to predict SVR, particularly in the 36 and 48 week
schedules. The absence of an EVR was not associated with
early treatment discontinuation (before week 12) or dose
modification in the current study (data not shown). In our
study, EVR was detected in 199 treated subjects (66 (69%), 65
(68%), and 66 (69%) subjects in groups A, B, C respectively;
p = 0.7 between groups A and B; p = 0.5 between groups A
and C; p = 0.6 between groups B and C) (fig 2A). Subjects
with an EVR by week 12 were more likely to have an SVR
than those who did not .Of those with an EVR (n = 199), 151
(76%) subsequently had an SVR. In group A, 25 of 66 (38%)
group A patients with an EVR went on to an SVR compared
with 63/65 (97%) and 66/66 (100%) in groups B and C,
respectively (p = 0.002 between groups A and B; p = 0.001
between groups A and C; p = 0.8 between groups B and C). In
all groups, no patient without an EVR ultimately had an SVR.
Interestingly, there was a significant difference in SVR rates
between short duration of therapy (24 weeks; group A) and
longer treatment schedules (36 weeks, group B and 48
weeks, group B) despite the finding that the EVR rates
showed no significant difference among the three groups.
Our results suggest that longer treatment duration is
necessary to maintain the virological response. Thus the
positive predictive value of an EVR may be adequate only
with appropriate treatment duration.
Viral kinetics
The mean effectiveness of Peg-IFN a-2b/ribavirin in blocking
viron production was a decline of 88.6% during the first day
of treatment. Early viral kinetics did not show significant
differences among the three patient groups either in the
estimated kinetic parameter c, which determines the first
phase decay, or in the estimated pretreatment infected cell
loss d, which determines the second phase decay. The third
phase of viral decline started about 7–28 days after therapy at
a similar level of viraemia for all treatment groups. The
triphasic viral decline pattern was detected in 104 subjects
(36%) (22 in group A, 60 in group B, and 59 in group C) and a
biphasic pattern was detected in 183 (64%) patients (table 2).
Analysis of the infected cell loss rate, Md, which
determines the third phase decay, probably enhanced by
treatment after some delay (t1), revealed two patterns of
response—namely, fast response with very fast decay and
undetectable HCV RNA 7–10 days after starting treatment

with Md >0.25 (/day) and slow response with flat decline
with Md ( than 0.25 (/day) (fig 3). The half life of free
virions was estimated at 3.5 hours and that of infected cells
from 1.9 hours to over 70 days. Fast response was detected in
48/95 (52%), 50/96 (53%), and 51/96(53%) subjects treated
with PEG-IFN-a-2b and ribavirin for 24, 36, and 48 weeks,
respectively (p = 0.9 between groups A and B; p = 0.8
between groups A and C). We found that 47/95 (49%), 46/
96 (47%), and 45/96 (47%) subjects in groups A, B, and C,
respectively, were slow (flat) responders (p.0.05 between all
groups).
Sustained responders showed significantly greater effi￾ciency factor (e) on viral production (89.3 (4.6)%) compared
with non-responders (58.2 (5.4)%; p = 0.003).
SVR and EVR were closely associated with a significant
increase in the infected cell loss rate, Md, reflecting the third
phase decay (p,0.01, p,0.001, respectively). We found that
155/157 sustained virological responders (99%) had Md
greater than 0.25 (/day) while Md ranged between 0.18 and
0.2 in 2/157 sustained virological responders (1%).
Liver histology
All patients underwent liver biopsy before and after treat￾ment. Pairwise comparison of histological grading and
staging scores for the initial and follow up biopsies showed
no deterioration or progression of fibrosis in any patient and
improvement (.2 point necroinflammatory score improve￾ment) was detected in 155 patients (54%). Histological
response was more likely in those who received longer
treatment schedules as histological improvement was
detected in 67 patients treated for 36 weeks and in 71
treated for 48 weeks versus 12 treated for 24 weeks.
Improvement in histological score was greatest in sustained
virological responders who showed a 3–5 point decrease in
necroinflammatory (grading) scores and regression in fibro￾sis scores (fig 4). Fourteen relapsers showed .2 point
improvement in the grading score in follow up biopsies

while 12 patients had no substantial changes (,2 points)
from the baseline biopsy. The decrease was more obvious for
total inflammatory activity and periportal and lobular
necrosis than for portal inflammation (data not shown).
Comparing baseline characteristics of patients who achieved
significant histological response and those who had no
histological improvement in the second biopsy identified
histological responders as being younger (mean 37 (9) v 48
(12) years in those with no improvement), having lower
mean pretreatment grading scores (4.3 (1.8) v 9.5 (3.6);
p = 0.02) and fibrosis stage (1.2 (1.1) v 2.9 (1.9); p = 0.04)
The presence of steatosis in the pretreatment liver biopsy did
not significantly affect the histological or virological
response. The majority of patients who had histological
improvement in the follow up biopsy belonged to the groups
that had the longer PEG-IFN schedules.
Variables associated with PEG-IFN responsiveness
To identify predictors of an SVR, the following factors were
evaluated: age (,40 years v >40 years), sex, weight (,75 kg
v >75 kg or more), mode of HCV transmission, duration of
infection (,20 years v >20 years), rural or urban residence,
duration of therapy (24 weeks v 36/48 weeks), pretreatment
ALT quotient (.3 v (3), pretreatment HCV RNA level
(2 million copies/ml v .2 million copies/ml), and pretreat￾ment histological grading and staging score. Sex, mode of
transmission, weight, pretreatment ALT, and histological
scores did not predict response to PEG-IFN-a-2b/ribavirin
therapy. High levels of HCV RNA (p,0.0001) and short
treatment period (24 weeks, p = 0.0005) were closely asso￾ciated with poor response to PEG-IFN-a-2b plus ribavirin
therapy. All patients who relapsed had significantly higher
pretreatment HCV-RNA levels compared with sustained
responders. Analysis of early viral kinetics showed that rapid
response to therapy with greater antiviral efficacy (e) .85%,
higher rate of infected cell loss (d) .0.5, and higher viral load
decline within the first 24 hours of therapy were associated
with response.
Multivariate analysis for factors associated with
responsiveness
The factors identified by multivariate analysis as significant
predictors of SVR were viral load ((2 million copies/ml)
(odds ratio 132.3 (95% CI 15.3–1043)) and age ((40 years)
(odds ratio 113.25 (95% CI 22.09–952.12); p,0.001). Therapy
duration was closely related to SVR.
Adverse events
As shown in table 3, rates and types of adverse events were
similar in the three groups. Discontinuation occurred in one
(2%), two (2%), and five (5%) patients in groups A, B, and C,
respectively (fig 1, table 3) while modification of 1–2 doses
occurred in 14 (15%), 24 (26%), and 30 (32%) in groups A, B,
and C, respectively. The most common events leading to
discontinuation were severe haematological abnormalities
(n = 6), psychiatric disorders (mainly depression related
events; n = 1), and hypothyroidism (n = 1). Rates of reduc￾tion in the dose of PEG-IFN-a-2b were higher in patients
treated for 48 weeks compared with 24 weeks (p = 0.03
between groups A and C) and 36 weeks (p = 0.04 between
groups B and C).
An initial decrease in median haemoglobin was detected
between weeks 1 and 8 in 189 patients. The maximal
decrease was greater in patients treated with PEG-IFN-a-2b
plus ribavirin (4 g/dl) for 48 weeks. Anaemia improved in
149 patients without dose reduction while dose reduction
was required for 2–3 weeks in 9 (9%), 13 (14%), and 18
(19%) patients in groups A, B, and C, respectively.

Haemoglobin levels returned to near baseline values after
treatment was completed in all patients. Erythropoietin was
not used in this population.
A decrease in median neutrophil counts compared with
baseline was reported in all treatment groups at some time
point during therapy, particularly during the first eight weeks
of treatment. Gradual stabilisation and an increase in
neutrophil counts occurred thereafter and counts reached
levels comparable with baseline values after completion of
therapy. Discontinuation of therapy due to reduction of
neutrophil counts below 500/mm3 occurred in one (1%), one
(1%), and three (3%) subjects in groups A, B, and C,
respectively (data not shown). Two subjects in group C who
discontinued therapy due to neutrophil counts ,500/mm3
developed pneumonia, which was adequately treated. No
growth factors were used in this population.
A progressive decrease in median platelet counts was
detected in 123 subjects, particularly during the first eight
weeks of treatment but gradual stabilisation occurred in 94/
123 subjects (76%). After treatment was completed, median
platelet counts returned to normal within four weeks. Three
patients with thrombocytopenia (one in group B and two in
group C) had a significant decrease in platelet levels in
addition to reduction of neutrophil counts with bleeding and
thus discontinued treatment.
None of the treated patients had a history of depression or
active depression at baseline. Moderate depression (accord￾ing to Centers for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale
score of 16–20) was reported in three (3%), three (3%), and
nine (9%) patients in groups A, B, and C, respectively
(table 3), and led to discontinuation of therapy in one subject
in group C. Initiation of antidepressant medication during
treatment in nine patients (two in group A, three in group B,
and four in group C) helped continuation of therapy.
Thyroiditis was reported in one patient in group C which
required discontinuation of therapy. There were no unex￾pected or unusual adverse events reported during this study.
None of the responders, relapsers, or non-responders devel￾oped decompensation during follow up. No deaths were
reported during therapy or follow up.
DISCUSSION
Previous reports showed that HCV-4 was similarly resistant
to conventional interferon monotherapy14 22 or interferon/
ribavirin combination therapy13 as HCV-1. To date, response
rates and duration of PEG-IFN-ribavirin treatment in
genotype 4 have not been identified and therefore this study
investigated the efficacy and safety as well as the duration of
PEG-IFN/ribavirin therapy in chronic hepatitis C genotype 4.
We showed that patients chronically infected with HCV-4
responded favourably to PEG-IFN-a-2b plus ribavirin therapy
with SVR rates higher than those reported for genotype 1
with PEG-IFN-a-2a/ribavirin (46–58%) or PEG-IFN-a 2b/
ribavirin (48%)15–18 but lower than SVR rates in genotypes 2
and 3.15 16 In the present study, SVR rates of 63% and 69%
detected in subjects treated for 36 and 48 weeks, respectively,
were similar to previous reports from Saudi Arabia involving
smaller cohorts infected with genotype 4.23 24 The high SVR
rates in the current study are attributed to selection criteria
and close monitoring which increased the compliance of our
patients with the prescribed medications, with few patient
dropouts and limited dose reduction during the study period.
In addition, the study population did not include patients
with cirrhosis and only 16 patients were overweight with a
body mass index .30 kg/m2
.
Previous reports showed that treatment with PEG-IFN-a
and ribavirin needs to be individualised by genotype as
patients with genotype 1 require treatment for 48 weeks
while those with genotype 2 or 3 can be adequately treated
for 24 weeks.18 To date, the appropriate duration of PEG￾IFN-a/ribavirin therapy for genotype 4 has not been
determined and therefore the current study was designed
to compare three treatment periods—–namely, short treat￾ment for 24 weeks, and longer periods for 36 weeks and
48 weeks. In the current study, significantly higher sustained
clearance rates were achieved with the 36 or 48 week
schedules compared with the 24 week schedule The sig￾nificant absolute differences between 24 weeks of treatment
and longer treatment periods (48 or 36 weeks) and high
virological relapse rate after 24 weeks of treatment suggests
that 24 weeks of PEG-IFN-a-2b/ribavirin therapy is inade￾quate to treat genotype 4 and, as previously reported in
genotype 1,18 genotype 4 requires longer treatment periods to
achieve SVR and decrease virological relapse rates. SVR rates
were not significantly different between the 36 and 48 week
regimens which may imply that PEG-IFN-a-2b ribavirin
therapy for 36 weeks may be similarly effective as 48 weeks
of therapy for HCV-4, although these findings need to be
confirmed in larger clinical trials.
To date, the reason for the differences in response of
various genotypes to antiviral therapy remains unclear as it is
not known why certain genotypes respond more favourably
to antiviral therapy than other genotypes. The outcome of
therapy may be influenced by a dynamic complex relation￾ship that exists between the pharmacological characteristics
of the therapeutic regimen, viral kinetics, and host immune
responses.25 The ‘‘effectiveness’’ of interferon therapy has
been defined as per cent inhibition of virus production during
the first day of therapy.20 The current study showed that the
antiviral effectiveness of PEG-IFN-a-2b in blocking produc￾tion of HCV-4 during the first day was higher than that
reported by Halfon and colleagues19 during HCV genotype 4
treatment with conventional interferon, which implies a
more enhanced antiviral action of PEG-IFN-a-2b and
ribavirin and may explain the greater efficacy of PEG-IFN
in inducing SVR rates compared with conventional interferon
formulations. The viral dynamics of HCV-4 in our study were
more rapid than those detected in patients with chronic
hepatitis C genotype 1 treated with PEG-IFN-a but were
relatively slower than those of genotypes 2.26 The variation in
viral dynamic parameters of genotypes during therapy may
contribute to the differences in SVR rates and duration of
therapy.
EVR to therapy may serve as a decision tool for physicians
to identify patients who are unlikely to achieve an SVR and to
consider discontinuation of treatment in those patients to
spare them the side effects and cost of additional therapy. In
the current study, although the EVR rates were not
significantly different among the three treatment schedules,
SVR rates differed significantly between 24 weeks of therapy
and the longer therapy duration (36 weeks and 48 weeks).
Pretreatment patient characteristics, patient compliance, and
early viral kinetics are unlikely to account for the differences
in SVR rates among the short and long treatment schedules
as none of these factors differed significantly among the
patients groups. In accordance with previous studies, EVR at
week 12 in the present study was a reliable clinical time point
for prediction of SVR in patients with chronic hepatitis C
genotype 4 provided that therapy was completed for at least
36 weeks. Thus our findings suggest that duration of
treatment seems to play a crucial role in maintaining EVR
and achieving SVR and further confirms several reports
showing that PEG-IFN therapy should be individualised
according to genotype.18
In this study, therapy was not associated with worsening of
grading or staging scores in any patient, irrespective of the
treatment regimen, as shown in other studies conducted in
patients infected with genotypes 1, 2, and 3.15–18 26 However,

in our study, histological improvement in genotype 4 was
significantly related to longer duration of therapy, with no
significant difference between the 36 week and 48 week
regimens. SVR in our study was associated with greater
histological improvement in the form of significant necro￾inflammatory and regression of fibrosis scores, in accordance
with other studies in other genotypes25 27 suggesting that
non-cirrhotic patients with an SVR might be regarded as
cured. Patients who relapsed benefited from therapy and
showed improvement in grading and staging scores in follow
up biopsies.
Viral load was highly correlated with PEG-IFN-a-2b/
ribavirin responsiveness, being the best predictive marker
for responsiveness, as shown by multivariate analysis in our
study and previous studies.15–18 23 Among patients with high
pretreatment viral levels, a substantially higher proportion of
those treated with PEG-IFN-a-2b plus ribavirin for 48 weeks
had an SVR than those treated for 36 weeks while none of
those who achieved SVR after the 24 week schedule had high
baseline HCV-RNA levels. Pretreatment HCV-RNA levels
were not only associated with non-response but were also
shown to be associated with an increased risk for virological
relapse. Taken together our findings may suggest that
traditionally difficult to treat subgroups such as patients
with high viral load may benefit more from 48 weeks of
therapy.
The commonest adverse events reported in the present
study were anaemia and reductions in neutrophil and platelet
counts in accordance with previous studies with other
genotypes.15–18 Although the incidence of adverse events was
higher in patients treated with PEG-IFN-a-2b plus ribavirin
for 48 weeks than in those treated for 36 or 24 weeks, these
adverse events did not appear to be associated with serious
sequelae and were effectively managed by dose reduction
or modifications. Short PEG-IFN-a-2b/ribavirin therapy
(24 weeks) was generally better tolerated than the longer
regimens but our study showed that 24 weeks of therapy is
ineffective in maintaining an SVR in genotype 4.
Taken together, PEG-IFN-a-2b plus ribavirin for 36 weeks
was well tolerated and induced reasonable sustained
virological and histological responses. The finding that
PEG-IFN-a-2b plus ribavirin therapy for 36 weeks was better
tolerated and similarly effective as 48 weeks of therapy may
have important implications for developing countries, parti￾cularly in Egypt where chronic hepatitis due to HCV-4
represents an economic burden. Shorter effective therapeutic
schemes would provide increased clinical benefit, improve
patient compliance and quality of life, in addition to reducing
the initial antiviral drug treatment costs and making antiviral
treatment more ‘‘cost effective’’. The direct cost attributed to
hospital admissions for HCV related complications in the
USA was estimated to be $514 million in 1995.28 In Egypt, the
burden of disease would be much greater given that an
estimated 12 million (20% of 60 million) are infected with
HCV. The probability of patients with chronic HCV develop￾ing cirrhosis over a 30 year period ranges from 13% to 46% for
men and from 1% to 29% for women.2 6 In a cross sectional
study from Egypt, cirrhosis was detected in 3% of the study
population8
; even if this value was only 1%, the number of
HCV related cirrhosis cases and burden of disease would be
significantly greater than that estimated for the USA both
now and for the next decade. The incremental cost effective￾ness of combination therapy with PEG-IFN ranges from
US$26 000 to 64 000 for genotype 1 and from US$10 000 to
28 000 for genotypes 2 and 3.29 30 Given the additional clinical
benefit in the form of higher sustained virological and
histological response rates, the improvements in health
related quality of life, and expected long term benefit, one
may conclude that PEG-IFN and ribavirin therapy may be
also cost effective in genotype 4 but this needs to be assessed
in a developing country with a high HCV prevalence, such as
Egypt.
A limitation of our study was that follow up was restricted
to 48 weeks after completion of therapy and thus long term
clinical outcomes could not be determined. Late relapse may
occur after four years of completion of treatment with
conventional interferon and ribavirin according to previous
studies.27 Long term follow up of sustained virological
responders beyond 48 weeks after cessation of therapy is
required to determine the long term benefit of therapy.
Efficacy, benefit/risk ratio, and cost effectiveness of 36 weeks
versus 48 weeks of therapy in HCV-4 require larger trials with
longer follow up to identify suitable patients who are most
likely to benefit from each treatment schedule. Another
limitation is that all of the study subjects had abnormal
transaminases and none had cirrhotic changes. None of the
subjects had comorbid conditions such as schistosomiasis,
which is endemic in Egypt. Thus we do not know whether
patients with normal liver enzyme levels, early compen￾sated cirrhosis, or other coexisting conditions will respond
similarly.
In conclusion, chronic hepatitis C genotype 4 responds
favourably to PEG-IFN-a-2b plus ribavirin therapy. We have
shown that 48 weeks and 36 weeks of treatment were
statistically superior to 24 weeks of treatment. Our observa￾tion that 36 weeks of therapy for genotype 4 is well tolerated
and induces similar sustained virological response rates to
the 48 week regimen may have important clinical implica￾tions in the form of increasing adherence, decreasing adverse
events, and increasing the cost effectiveness of therapy.
