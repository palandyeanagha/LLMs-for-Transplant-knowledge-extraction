Exercise is an effective intervention for treating hypertension and arterial stiffness, but little is known about which exercise
modality is the most effective in reducing arterial stiffness and blood pressure in hypertensive subjects. Our purpose was to
evaluate the effect of continuous vs. interval exercise training on arterial stiffness and blood pressure in hypertensive patients.
Sixty-five patients with hypertension were randomized to 16 weeks of continuous exercise training (n¼26), interval training
(n¼26) or a sedentary routine (n¼13). The training was conducted in two 40-min sessions a week. Assessment of arterial
stiffness by carotid–femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) measurement and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM)
were performed before and after the 16 weeks of training. At the end of the study, ABPM blood pressure had declined
significantly only in the subjects with higher basal values and was independent of training modality. PWV had declined
significantly only after interval training from 9.44±0.91 to 8.90±0.96 m s1, P¼0.009 (continuous from 10.15±1.66 to
9.98±1.81 m s1, P¼ns; control from 10.23±1.82 to 10.53±1.97 m s1, P¼ns). Continuous and interval exercise training
were beneficial for blood pressure control, but only interval training reduced arterial stiffness in treated hypertensive subjects.

INTRODUCTION
A sedentary lifestyle has been characterized as an independent risk
factor for cardiovascular disease.1 Studies have shown the inverse
association between physical activity level and the incidence of
cardiovascular diseases.2,3,4 Various mechanisms could be involved
in the cardiovascular protective effects of physical activity, including
improvement in endothelial function, a decrease in sympathetic neural
activity and a reduction in arterial stiffness. Increased arterial stiffness
has been associated with hypertension in elderly subjects5,6 and with
cardiovascular risk in middle-aged hypertensive patients. Several
studies have shown the beneficial effects of exercise on arterial stiffness
in different diseases. However, the best exercise modality for better
control of hypertension and improved arterial function has not been
well established.
Continuous exercise training is the type of physical activity most
frequently recommended to hypertensive subjects.7 However, some
studies have shown that interval exercise training may have greater
effects on exercise capacity in healthy subjects8,9 and those with
cardiovascular disorders.10 Interval training promotes greater gradi￾ents of shear stress because patients fluctuate between high and low
intensities.11 We have recently shown that interval exercise acutely
decreases blood pressure in hypertensive patients.12 We therefore
hypothesized that interval exercise has a better effect on arterial
stiffness and blood pressure control than continuous exercise does
in hypertensive subjects.
The aim of this study was to compare the impact on arterial
stiffness of a continuous exercise protocol with one involving interval
exercise training, as evaluated by pulse wave velocity (PWV) measure￾ment and 24-h blood pressure control in treated hypertensive subjects.
METHODS
Study population
We studied 65 sedentary hypertensive subjects (23 male, 42 female) on anti￾hypertensive medication and controlled office blood pressure (systolic blood
pressure o140 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure o90 mm Hg on anti￾hypertensive drugs) without complications for at least 3 months. Subjects were
recruited from the hypertension department of a tertiary hospital and rando￾mized into three groups: continuous, interval and control. The characteristics
of the population are listed in Table 1. We excluded subjects with diagnosed
coronary artery disease or an abnormal electrocardiogram during the exercise

test as well as patients with non-cardiovascular functional limitations such as
osteoarthritis. Subjects participating in regular physical activity (more than
once a week) for the previous 6 months were also excluded.
This protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the study institution.
All patients provided informed consent before participation.
Study design
This was a randomized, controlled trial to investigate the effects of continuous
and interval exercise training on arterial stiffness and blood pressure in
hypertensive subjects. First, all subjects underwent an exercise test to exclude
electrocardiographic abnormalities. After 2 days, we performed PWV measure￾ments by using a non-invasive device and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure
monitoring (ABPM). Referred patients with no exclusion criteria were rando￾mized in a 2:2:1 ratio between the continuous, interval and control groups,
respectively. A computer-generated randomization list was created by the
statistician. The 2:2:1 randomization sequence was developed in blocks of five,
including two continuous, two intervals and one control. The order of training
and control within each block was also randomly assigned. Two days after the
last session of the exercise training protocol (16 weeks), subjects were evaluated
again for comparison, and the measurements were carried out by an investi￾gator blinded to the exercise modality (Figure 1).
Exercise test
All subjects were asked to refrain from both strenuous physical activities and
the consumption of any stimulants (for example, coffee, tobacco and alcohol)
that might influence heart rate for 24 h before the exercise test and not to eat at
least 2 h before the start of the test. They underwent exercise testing on a
programmable treadmill (Quinton, Quinton, Seattle, WA, USA) with a
standard 12-lead continuous electrocardiography monitor (TAB-SM 310), in
a temperature-controlled room (21–23 1C) between 10:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m.
Blood pressure monitoring was performed by the auscultatory method. Resting
heart rates were computed as the mean of the final 30 s of the resting period,
and peak heart rates were the mean values of the final 30 s of effort before
exhaustion. A satisfactory exercise test (modified Bruce protocol) was defined
by symptoms of maximum effort. The maximum exercise heart rate predicted
for age was calculated by subtracting the subject’s age from 220.
Exercise training protocol
All subjects performed the exercise training protocol in a room with tempera￾ture controlled at 20±1 1C for 16 weeks, three times per week (two supervised
and one non-supervised session). Supervised exercise sessions consisted of
10 min of warm-up stretching exercises, 40 min of exercise training on a
treadmill (either continuous or interval exercises), 20 min of submaximal
strength training and 10 min of cool-down exercises. During non-supervised
exercise sessions the patients were instructed to follow the same protocol
carried out during supervised sessions. The control group was advised to
maintain their daily activities without exercise training during the 16-week
period.
Exercise intensity was determined according to the workload reached during
the maximal graded exercise test and was calculated to promote the same
cardiovascular workload for both continuous and interval training. Continuous
exercise was 40 min on a treadmill at 60% of reserve heart rate. Interval exercise
was 40 min on a treadmill with intensity alternating between 50% (2 min) and
80% (1 min) of reserve heart rate, resulting in a mean workload of 60%
((50%2)+80%/3). Reserve heart rate was calculated as the difference between
peak and resting heart rate, multiplied by the intensity of exercise and added to
resting heart rate, according to the Karvonen method. Peak and resting heart
rates were obtained during the graded exercise test. Each individual’s heart rate
was monitored during all exercise sessions with a heart rate monitor (Polar
Beat, Polar Eletro, Kempele, Finland). Subjects were excluded if they did not
perform more than 70% of the exercise sessions.
Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring
Twenty-four hour ABPM was performed on the non-dominant arm using an
oscillometric device (SpaceLabs Redmond, Issaquah, WA, USA). The device
was set to take readings every 15 min during the day and every 20 min during
the night, and a new measurement was obtained after 2 min if the first one was
unsuccessful. The software automatically edited values outside the normal
physiological ranges and spurious readings because of external factors such as
arm movement. Awake and asleep periods were determined by the patient
before the examination. All subjects were instructed to maintain their usual
activities and medications. The ABPM was set a day before each maximal
cardiopulmonary exercise test. Data were accepted only if at least 75% of the
measurements were successfully taken.
Arterial stiffness
Arterial stiffness was evaluated using carotid–femoral PWV measurements by a
non-invasive automatic device (Complior; Colson, Garges les Gonesses, France)

obtained by an experienced observer blinded to the patients’ clinical character￾istics and exercise modality. Briefly, common carotid artery and femoral
artery pressure waveforms were recorded non-invasively by a pressure-sensitive
transducer (TY-306-Fukuda; Fukuda; Tokyo, Japan). The distance between
the recording sites (D) was measured, and PWV was automatically calculated as
PWV¼D/t, where t represents pulse transit time.13 Measurements were
repeated over 10 cardiac cycles, and the mean was used for the final
analysis. Patients were told not to take anti-hypertensive medications on the
day of the procedure. All of the tests were performed in the afternoon between
3 p.m. and 4 p.m. by the same physician who was blinded to the patient’s
group.
Statistical analysis
Descriptive analyses are presented as means with standard deviation. The blood
pressure and PWV measurements were normally distributed. The two-way
ANOVA (grouptime) with repeated measures was used to compare the data.
Bonferroni post hoc analysis was performed to evaluate the differences among
groups. As systolic blood pressure has a direct influence on PWV measure￾ments, we adjusted the values for the mean systolic blood pressure when
comparisons among groups were done. Pearson’s correlation was used to
analyze associations between age and PWV decline in all groups.
Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences for
Windows, 11.5 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). Statistical significance was defined
as Po0.05.
RESULTS
The three groups had similar age, body mass index, office blood
pressure, PWV values and current medication distribution (Table 1).
Of the 65 randomized subjects, 43 completed the protocol. Seven
subjects from the continuous group and seven from the interval group
dropped out of the study for personal reasons. Two subjects were
excluded because of changes in their medication (one in the contin￾uous exercise and one in the control group) and five because they
performed o70% of the exercise sessions (two from the continuous
group). One subject from the control group became pregnant
(Figure 1). The protocol was well tolerated, and there were no
differences in the training session between the continuous and interval
groups (82±9 and 81±10%, respectively). Three women were post￾menopausal (two in the interval group and one in the control group).
After 16 weeks of intervention, mean 24 h, daytime and nighttime
systolic and diastolic blood pressure did not change significantly in
any of the three groups (Table 2). When we analyzed the two exercise
groups together, exercise training significantly decreased the mean 24 h
and daytime diastolic blood pressure, whereas diastolic blood pressure
at nighttime and mean 24 h, daytime and nighttime systolic blood
pressure did not change (Figure 2). The decrease in blood pressure on
ABPM was more significant in subjects whose office blood pressure
was above median values (24 h 126/80, daytime 131/84 and nighttime
117/73 mm Hg) at study inclusion (Figure 3).
Interval exercise training significantly decreased the carotid to
femoral PWV values after 16 weeks, whereas no significant changes
were observed in the continuous and control groups (Figure 4). The
heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure before and after 16
weeks, measured before PWV evaluation, did not differ among the
three groups (Table 3). Moreover, there was no correlation between
age and PWV decline for all groups (continuous r¼0.11 and P¼0.34,
interval r¼0.30 and P¼0.12, and control r¼0.30 and P¼0.18).
Body mass index and waist circumference were unchanged after
completion of the protocol in the three groups.
DISCUSSION
This is the first trial to evaluate the effects of interval exercise training
on 24-h blood pressure and arterial stiffness in hypertensive subjects
receiving long-term treatment. The main finding was the observation
that exercise training, independent of the exercise training method,
decreased blood pressure on ABPM. Moreover, only interval training
improved arterial stiffness as evaluated by a decrease in carotid–
femoral PWV.
Blood pressure
It is well known that aerobic exercise decreases blood pressure, mainly
in the daytime. These blood pressure-lowering effects are more
pronounced in hypertensive patients.14,15,16,17
One meta-analysis demonstrated that aerobic exercise decreases
systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 6.9 and 4.9 mm Hg, respec￾tively, in hypertensive patients vs. 2.4 and 1.6 mm Hg in normotensive
subjects.15 Another meta-analysis, which included ambulatory
blood pressure measurements, demonstrated that aerobic exercise
decreases systolic/diastolic blood pressure by 4.5/2.4 mm Hg during
the daytime and 1.7/0.7 mm Hg during the nighttime.18 Our study is
in agreement with these results; blood pressure in our subjects
decreased during the daytime, mainly in those with higher blood
pressure values.
A few studies have analyzed the effects of different intensities
of exercise training on blood pressure. These studies showed that

exercise intensity does not influence the level of blood pressure
decline.7,18 Our study is in agreement with those findings and
shows that exercise intensity does not influence the decrease in
blood pressure.
Several factors are involved in the blood pressure decline mediated
by exercise training, but the improvement in peripheral vascular
resistance seems to have the most important role. The decrease in
sympathetic nervous system activity,19 effects on baroreflex control20
and improvement in nitric oxide production and action (endothelial
function)21 are probably involved in the anti-hypertensive effects of
exercise. Moreover, effects on arterial remodeling,22 angiogenesis23 and
arterial distensibility24 might be related to the blood pressure decline
after aerobic exercise training.
Arterial stiffness
The aging process leads to a progressive increase in arterial stiffness,
especially in large arteries, as has been clinically observed in elderly
patients. Indeed, in hypertensive subjects this increase is more
pronounced.25 Aerobic exercise training seems to attenuate arterial
stiffness in healthy subjects, but the results in hypertensive patients are
controversial.25 Twelve weeks of aerobic exercise training, at 70–75%
of the maximum heart rate, increased the carotid compliance of
healthy subjects to the same values as endurance-trained men.2
However, 8–12 weeks of aerobic exercise training at 65–70% of the
maximum heart rate did not improve arterial stiffness in patients with
systolic hypertension.24,26 In our study, after 16 weeks of training,
arterial stiffness, measured by PWV, decreased only in the aerobic
interval training group. The exercise intensity and the severity of
disease could explain these conflicting results.
The mechanisms involved in arterial stiffness are degradation of the
elastic matrix, endothelial dysfunction, hypertrophy and hyperplasia
of the smooth muscle cells and increase in collagen content.27,28 These
mechanisms seem to be more accelerated in hypertensive subjects.28,27
On the other hand, an experimental study showed that the magnitude
of wall distension promoted by a given shear stress affects the change
in arterial stiffness through mechano-biochemical signaling that
compromises vasorelaxation.29 Thus, aerobic exercise training with
increased intensity or duration should be required to better improve
arterial stiffness in hypertensive subjects. Nevertheless, in healthy
subjects with less stiff arteries, a short duration and low intensity of
exercise could be sufficient to improve arterial function.2,4 In this
context, aerobic exercise with increased intensity could be required to
improve arterial stiffness in hypertensive subjects, as observed in our
study. As younger subjects may have less stiff arteries, and they may

react with a greater PWV drop, one might argue that a 5-year
difference between continuous and interval training may have influ￾enced the results. However, this age difference was not statistically
significant. Moreover, we did not find significant correlation between
age and PWV drop.
Clinical implications
The reduction in blood pressure after both training protocols,
although observed mainly in individuals with more elevated baseline
levels, has important clinical implications because it has been docu￾mented that a reduction of only 2 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure
decreases mortality from cerebral vascular accidents by 10% and
cardiovascular disease by 7%.30
Arterial stiffness has been shown to be an independent predictor of
cardiovascular and all-cause mortality31 in hypertensive patients.
Sedentary lifestyle and anti-hypertensive treatment resulted in an
increase of 0.8 m s1 of PWV in 6 years.27 Our study shows that
only 16 weeks of interval training caused a drop in PWV of 0.41 m s1
in a similar population.
Regular physical activity is an effective intervention with respect to
these factors, decreasing the mortality rate for cardiovascular disease
and all causes of diseases in hypertensive patients,32 attenuating the
increase in the arterial stiffness associated with age,2 as well as
reducing genetic susceptibility to this increase.33 In addition, physical
activity helps to control the metabolic variables related to hyper￾tension and arterial stiffness.34
Study limitations
This study has several limitations. The percentage of adherence to
exercise training was 61% for both the interval and the continuous
groups, which is a low level of adherence. There were two supervised
training sessions per week; however, the patients were instructed to
perform a non-supervised exercise session. Still, it has been shown that
there is no significant difference in blood pressure reduction between
an exercise training program requiring two sessions per week as
compared with three sessions.35 In addition, we do not know whether
our results would have been different for those whose hypertension
was controlled compared with those with uncontrolled hypertension.
Perspectives
Interval and continuous exercise training were well tolerated in
chronic hypertensive subjects treated with anti-hypertensive drugs.
Blood pressure control improved with exercise training, but only
interval exercise improved arterial stiffness, measured by PWV analy￾sis, which re-affirms the need for the inclusion of physical activity in
the treatment of hypertensive patients.
