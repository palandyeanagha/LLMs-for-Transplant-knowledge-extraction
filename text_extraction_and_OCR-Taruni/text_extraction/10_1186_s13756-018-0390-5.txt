Abstract
Background: In France, Carbapenem-Resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) and Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococci
(VRE) are considered as Extensively Drug-Resistant (XDR) bacteria. Their management requires reinforcement of
hospital’s hygiene policies, and currently there is few consistent data concerning the spontaneous decolonization
in XDR colonized patients. Our aim is to study the natural history of decolonization of XDR carriers over time in a
hospital setting in a low prevalence country.
Material and methods: Retrospective multicenter study over 2 years (2015–2016) in 2 different tertiary care
hospital sites and units having an agreement for permanent cohorting of such XDR carriers. We gathered the
type of microorganisms, risk factors for colonization and rectal swabs from patient’s follow-up. We also evaluated
patient care considering isolation precautions.
Results: We included 125 patients, aged 63+/−19y, including 72.8% of CRE (n = 91), 24.8% of VRE (n = 31) and 2.
4% (n = 3) co-colonized with CRE and VRE. CRE were mainly E. coli (n = 54), K. pneumoniae (n = 51) and E. cloacae
(n = 6). Mechanisms of resistance were mainly OXA-48 (n = 69), NDM-1 (n = 11), OXA-232 (n = 8) and KPC (n = 3).
Prior antibiotic therapy was reported in 38.4% (n = 48) of cases. Conversely, 17.6% (n = 22) received antibiotics
during follow-up.
Spontaneous decolonization occurred within the first 30 days in 16.4% (n = 19/116) of cases and up to 48.2%
after day-90 with a median follow-up of 96 days (0–974).
We estimated that XDR carriage was associated with a larger care burden in 13.6% (n = 17) of cases, especially
due to a prolongation of hospitalization of 32.5 days (15–300).
Conclusions: Our study shows that spontaneous decolonization is increasing over time (up to 48.2%). We can
regret that only few patients underwent screening after 1 year, emphasizing the need for more monitoring and
prospective studies.

Introduction
In recent years, multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO), es￾pecially Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococcus (VRE) and
Carbapenem-Resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) [1] are be￾coming more prevalent worldwide and represent a serious
public health threat since they are becoming increasingly
resistant to current treatment drugs. Moreover, CRE infec￾tions have been associated with an increased risk of mortal￾ity in Europe [2, 3].
In France, VRE and CRE belong to a group of Exten￾sively Drug-Resistant (XDR) bacteria. They are spreading
worldwide and oblige us to reinforce our in-hospital hy￾giene policy [4]. It has been suggested by the CDC [5] and
national guidelines [6] that patients carrying such micro￾organisms must be ideally placed in isolation in a specific
ward and cared for by a dedicated paramedical team, not￾ably nurses. Nonetheless, it is well known that healthcare
workers spent less time with patients in isolation which
impacts negatively patient mental well-being [7].
Furthermore, no specific treatment is currently available
to promote decolonization of these MDROs. Indeed,
decolonization strategies have resulted in colonization re￾lapse with the emergence of resistance to the intended
therapies [8–10]. More recently, fecal microbiota trans￾plantation (FMT) has been proposed as a promising treat￾ment option to clear XDR carriage in mice [11] and in
humans [12–14], including immunocompromised individ￾uals [15]. To date, there are no randomized clinical trial
data to support its efficacy, but previous cited findings
suggest that FMT might be more effective against VRE
than CRE colonization. Yet, as FMT in such indication is
still under evaluation it cannot be performed in common
clinical practice, thereby leaving physicians without imme￾diate solution.
A recent systematic review by Bar-Yoseph et al.
showed that in the natural history of colonization among
healthcare residents, a significant proportion of CRE car￾riers (34.6%) remained colonized for up to 1 year [16].
While this meta-analysis is of interest, it is mainly com￾posed of 4 cohorts which benefited simultaneously from
active decolonization therapy and thus did not focus on
spontaneous decolonization.
As data are limited in the literature, we decided to
analyze the natural history of spontaneous decolonization
in XDR colonized patients and identify whether XDR car￾riage was associated with a larger care burden with a dif￾ference from the standard patient care because of the
cohorting strategy recommended in acute healthcare facil￾ities [5].
Methods
Study setting
The hospital group Paris-Ile-de-France Ouest is com￾posed of 2 main sites known as Raymond-Poincaré
hospital and Ambroise-Paré hospital. Both are tertiary
care hospitals with acute care facilities (255 and 750
beds, respectively) and share the same emergency unit
with approximately 28,400 admissions per year for
complete hospitalization.
Kremlin-Bicêtre hospital is a tertiary care hospital with
acute care facilities [1027 beds, including 55 beds in the
adult intensive care unit (ICU)] with also medium and
long-term care facilities (230 beds). There are ca. 20,000
admissions per year for complete hospitalization from
emergency unit.
These 2 hospitals are the only ones in the Paris area to
have an agreement for permanently dedicated staff and
beds to hospitalize patients colonized with XDR.
Raymond-Poincaré hospital unit of Infectious Disease
can accommodate up to 31 patients, including 5 to 8
beds in a dedicated unit for the management of XDR
carriers, whereas Kremlin-Bicêtre hospital has a 26-bed
infectious diseases unit with 6 beds dedicated to the
XDR carriers.
Patients were systematically screened every week with
rectal swabs sent to the operational hygiene team for
monitoring and follow-up.
We performed a retrospective multicenter study and
included all patients hospitalized in these specific units
with previously known or confirmed XDR colonization.
Data collection
Data were collected from January 2015–December 2016
in both dedicated units.
As a first step, medical charts were reviewed through
computerized charts including clinical and laboratory
data.
The following data were recorded:
 patient characteristics: past medical history, age, sex,
ethnic origin; Charlson Score Index (CCI);
 ideal hospital unit required for patient care and
length of stay (LOS);
 type of MDRO and their mechanism of resistance;
 possible cause of colonization and risk factors
associated with it;
 ongoing or previous antimicrobial therapy:
international drug name and duration; and
 follow-up swabs to assess decolonization (median
time and duration over time). We considered
decolonization as a clearance after at least 2 negative
specimens with at least a one-week interval
Consecutively, 2 independent infectious disease special￾ists (IDS) determined whether patients experienced a dis￾rupted medical care, by taking into account all the cited
above data. A larger care burden was defined by a pro￾longed LOS and a delay in their management according to
Davido et al. Antimicrobial Resistance and Infection Control (2018) 7:100 Page 2 of 8

the main diagnosis of hospitalization in comparison to the
average LOS obtained through the Computerized Medical
Information Systems Program (MISP), or in their hospital
discharge (i.e. a patient who requires surgery and is not
operated because of a MDRO carriage).
Microbiological data
Swabs were performed using sterile transport swab
(ref. 139C) on specific media (liquid Stuart, Venturi
Transystem® by COPAN Italia, Brescia, Italy).
Each swab was cultivated on specific selective media
(chromID® VRE and chromID® CARBA SMART by bio￾Mérieux, Marcy l’Etoile, France), and on regular MDRO
agar plates according to manufacturer. No enrichment
cultures were used.
Moreover, at admission colonization was systematically
confirmed by PCR testing (PCR Xpert CarbaR and Xpert
VanA/VanB by Cepheid, Maurens-Scopont®, France) and
during follow-up in case of negative culture on the
demand of physician.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed to compare rates and
study potential factors of decolonization between colo￾nized and decolonized patients. Student’s t-test was per￾formed to analyze continuous data using GraphPad
Prism v.7.0 (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA). Stat￾istical significance was defined as P < 0.05.
Results
Epidemiological data
A total of 198 stays regarding 125 patients with a mean
± standard deviation age of 63 ± 19 years were analyzed.
Sex ratio (M/F) was 2.6. Median Charlson score was 4
(IQR 3–6). Patients were colonizers in 95.2% (n = 119)
of cases whereas we observed 6 patients infected by a
XDR bacteria.
Initial causes of hospitalization are summarized in Fig. 1.
Infections accounted for 38.4% (n = 48) of etiologies on
the basis of the presence of fever with a microbiological
finding (such as respiratory multiplex PCR, urinalysis,
blood culture, bone and deep wound specimens or stool
sample). Median LOS was 12 days (range 1–290).
Considering patients who were known to be colonized
before hospitalization (n = 31), prior median duration
for colonization was 64 days (3–609). Conversely, for
patients discovered colonized at admission (n = 94), me￾dian time for the diagnosis of colonization was 2 days
(0–127) after admission.
MDRO colonization was divided as follows: 72.8% of
CRE (n = 91), 24.8% of VRE (n = 31) and 2.4% of
co-colonization VRE/CRE (n = 3).
For CRE, they were mainly composed of E. coli (n = 54)
(including 21 co-colonization), K. pneumoniae (n = 51)
(including 20 co-colonization), E. cloacae (n = 6) (3 co--
colonization), C. freundii (n = 6) (4 co-colonization) and E.
aerogenes (n = 3 co-colonization). Mechanisms of

resistance were OXA-48 (75.8%; n = 69), NDM-1 (12.1%;
n = 11), OXA-232 (8.8%; n = 8), VIM (3.3%; n = 3) or KPC
(3.3%; n = 3) and NDM-5 (n = 1); including OXA-48/
NDM-1 isolates (4.4%; n = 4).
For VRE, mechanisms of resistance were exclusively
Van-A phenotypes.
Common risk factors for the acquisition of XDR bacteria
were: i) a previous trip abroad in an endemic zone within
the year (59.2%; n = 74), including 51 local hospitalizations;
ii) an in-hospital contact with an already colonized patient
(23.2%; n = 29). Destinations considered as potentially re￾sponsible for the acquisition of resistance are illustrated in
Fig. 2.
Prior antimicrobial therapy was reported in 38.4% (n =
48) of cases. Conversely, 17.6% (n = 22) received antibiotics
during follow-up. Before and after regimens (n = 90) were
mainly composed of beta-lactams (n = 78) and fluoroquino￾lones (n = 23). Median duration of treatment was 14 days
(3–60). Antimicrobial agents are detailed in Tables 1 and 2.
Overall, only 4.8% (n = 6) of cases were infected by
XDR microorganisms. There were 4 monomicrobial in￾fections: E. coli OXA-48 (n = 2), K. pneumoniae OXA-48
(n = 1) and E. cloacae NDM-1 (n = 1) and 2 plurimicro￾bials including 1 E. coli + E. aerogenes OXA-48 and 1 K.
pneumoniae + E. coli OXA-48 like. No risk factors were
identified, patients had comparable median age (67 ±
27.5 years), median CCI (6 ranging from 0 to 8), identi￾cal median LOS = 12 days and prior use of antibiotics
(n = 2). They presented pyelonephritis (n = 2), bone and
joint infections (n = 2), mediastinitis (n = 1) and chole￾cystitis on a cancerous biliary obstruction (n = 1).
Follow-up of digestive tract colonization
A total of 116 patients were analyzed because 9 patients
were included in the ongoing study “FeDEX” registered
at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03029078) to attempt the
eradication of XDR colonization using FMT [12].

We observed a spontaneous decolonization in 48.2%
(n = 56) of cases. Median time for decolonization was
49 days (1–1091). Among them 34% (n = 19) were decolo￾nized within the first 30 days (D), 30.3% (n = 17) between
D31-D90, and the remaining 35.7% (n = 20) after D90. All
of them were followed-up with different time-points de￾pending on the scheduled consultation or eventually
re-admission. Their negative screens were confirmed with
a median follow-up of 96 days (0–974). Two individuals
exhibited re-colonization within the year.
Of note, 14.4% (n = 18) were followed after 1 year
(of which 13 were decolonized and 5 colonized patients).
In order to identify factors related to the decolonization,
we divided this cohort into 2 groups: decolonized and col￾onized patients. Results are summarized in Table 3. Our
data achieved statistical significance for duration of
hospitalization (p = 0.02) and duration of follow-up (p <
0.0001) which were longer for the decolonized patients. In
the limit of the sample size in a subgroup analysis, we
could not demonstrate any impact on decolonization be￾tween the different species, notably with an OXA-48
genotype (p = 0.35).
Outcomes and future of patient care
The mortality rate was 8.8% (n = 11). Death was more
likely attributable to underlying conditions than sepsis
related to the XDR bacteria (n = 2).
Most of the patients (72.8%, n = 91) returned home,
while 9.6% (n = 12) were transferred to rehabilitation,
8.8% were admitted to another acute healthcare facility
and 3 patients were placed in palliative care.
Patient care
We estimated that XDR carriage was associated with a
larger care burden in 13.6% (n = 17) of cases.
– Prolongation of hospitalization (n = 8): Main reason
was the absence of facility with the area of expertise
in hygiene and enough paramedical staff to adhere to
isolation precautions required for XDR organisms.
– Delayed surgery (n = 7): quite a few cases could not
benefit from surgery to the lack of technical
expertise on site and no direct possibility to arrange
a medical transfer with the required precautions.
The rate was significantly lower in Kremlin-Bicêtre
hospital in comparison to Raymond-Poincaré hospital,
2.9% (n = 2/70) versus 27.3% (n = 15/55), respectively
(p < 0.0001). The median time for the delay was 32.5 days
(15–300).
Benefits from the cohorting
Of 1916 patients in contact with the XDR carriers before
isolation, we screened 1603 patients. No secondary case
was recorded, and thus no outbreak occurred in both
sites.
We calculated that in the absence of dedicated units
it would have required 26,730 screenings (198*3*(20 +
25)). Our estimation was based among 198 stays con￾sidering there are 25 beds for non-XDR carriers in
Raymond-Poincaré and 20 beds in Kremlin-Bicêtre, and
that each patient requires 3 negative swabs before stop￾ping the screening procedures. Overall, both hospitals

Discussion
In our present cohort, spontaneous clearance of XDR
bacteria is not so rare and occurred in 48.2% of cases
with a median time of 49 days and one-third of them
were decolonized within a month. Those findings are
concordant with the limited data available in the litera￾ture reporting natural clearance of MDRO and especially
CRE [17–22] and VRE [23, 24] carriers during hospital
settings. All of them are retrospective data, mainly con￾cerning KPC cases occurring in Israel, except one pro￾spective sub-study issued in China by Cheng et al. [22]
which focused on NDM-1 isolates and reported a sur￾prisingly high rate of 72.2% (n = 57) of decolonization
within a short period (median delay of 30 days). Further￾more, sample size ranges from 66 to 125 patients and
some studies present mixed population by adding pa￾tients in rehabilitation centers and long-term care
facilities.
To our knowledge, this is the first study that de￾scribes natural decolonization of XDR (CRE and VRE
together) carriers in an adult medical ward in West￾ern Europe (France). Actually, in the literature only
one study was conducted in Germany but concerned
an outbreak of Carbapenem-Resistant K. pneumoniae
related to a patient transferred from Greece [17]
where the prevalence is deemed to be high (around
60% in 2013) [25]. Even if the prevalence of CRE is
still rare in France in 2016 (< 1%) [25], considering
the boarders we share with the Mediterranean coun￾tries, we should be wary of possible outbreaks.
Also, our cohort illustrates 2 interesting data. Firstly,
decolonization does not seem to result from the type of
microorganism (VRE versus CRE in Table 3). This is
consistent with the review of the literature, showing a
similar median of decolonization (around 6 months)
between VRE [24] and CRE carriers [16]. Secondly,
there is a trend of persistent bacterial carriage with
XDR bacteria under antibiotic exposure (p = 0.06), in
the limit of the sample size. Therefore, we could not
detail the different antimicrobials and prescriptions
duration impact on decolonization. Nevertheless, we
can assume that ongoing antimicrobial therapy may
slow down the clearance of XDR bacteria over time,
considering antimicrobial agents impact the gut micro￾biota [26]. This hypothesis is concordant with Schech￾ner et al. who argued that prior fluoroquinolones use
was predictive of persistent CRE rectal carriage [21]
and with Cheng et al. who reported an impact of the
use of proton pump inhibitors in addition to antimicro￾bial therapy [22].
We also observed 2 patients retested positive for CRE
after 2 negative swabs during follow-up, but both re￾ceived antimicrobial agents during the time interval.
Such observation reinforces our belief that there is a
close link between antibiotic exposure and selective
pressure on gut microbiota.
It is important to note that decolonized patients had
longer LOS than colonized patients (p = 0.02). This may
be explained by the fact that decolonized patients had
also longer follow-up (p < 0.0001). Also, while patients
are colonized, physicians are under pressure to expedite
patient discharge to avoid in-hospital spread of XDR
bacteria. Moreover, their follow-ups are difficult to
undertake, because most of the patients returned back
home (72.8%) mainly because of a refusal of other
healthcare facilities to set up necessary precautions.
Therefore, a majority of patients did not undergo
screening after 1 year (85.6%).
Furthermore, we described differences along the con￾tinuum of patient care between the 2 main study sites
(p < 0.0001). It can be explained by the fact that
Kremlin-Bicêtre hospital has a dedicated rehabilitation
unit for XDR carriers (up to 6 beds), isolated in contact
precautions (for MDRO) which contributes to improve
patient flow and also because Kremlin-Bicêtre hospital
has bigger facilities with a larger technical expertise.
Moreover, there is a lack of a consensual definition of
clearance, including VRE, partly due to heterogeneity in
the studied populations [24]. In the present work, we
considered at least 2 negative rectal swabs (> 1 week) as
a baseline for the decolonization process while Lubbert
et al. proposed a series of at least 4 consecutive negative
rectal swabs (> 1 week) [17], which is one major point
that limits the interest of all the above findings in
real-life conditions. In 2017 in the 39 hospitals of
AP-HP, the central committee for hygiene policy (CLIN)
proposed a series of at least 3 negative swabs with
one-year hindsight before considering the patient free
from XDR bacteria. Yet in Garches, we reduce precau￾tions from quarantine to contact precautions after
4 months of negative swabs, considering that patient
might still excrete XDR bacteria as soon as he is exposed
to antibiotics. Such long period of time can be some￾times really hard to face the patients, especially when
they are not infected.
Therefore, we believe our findings might be of interest
to guide hygiene policies accurately about reducing extra
precautions on readmission to the healthcare system to
lower a significant burden on healthcare provision. Be￾sides, one solution to enhance bacterial clearance might
be the FMT proposed by our team as a “fecal weapon”
which showed promising results [14].

Finally, this study has several limitations to be consid￾ered. First, we experienced a high rate of people lost to
follow-up after 1 year. This can be explained by the fact
that once a patient has been discharged, it is very difficult
to obtain a monthly rectal swab without evidence-based
medicine. Second, we did not perform systematically PCR
testing on follow-up swabs, considering that PCR was only
legitimate for a rapid initial diagnosis of carriage and not
indicated in routine surveillance considering its low posi￾tive predictive value of 16.6% [27] and would result in
higher costs. Thirdly, whereas multiple hospitalizations
(198 stays for 125 patients) were recorded in our analysis,
we cannot warrant that some patients were hospitalized in
other acute care facilities between the initial culture and
the final follow-up.
Conclusions
In a context of multidrug resistance development and a
lack of new antimicrobial agents, a stringent surveillance
of XDR bacteria is needed. Our study shows that a spon￾taneous decolonization occurred within the first 30 days
in 16.4% of cases and up to 48.2% after day-90. This major
point confirms that spontaneous decolonization is not so
rare and does not seem to be static over time which is very
encouraging. We observed a larger care burden in almost
one-tenth of XDR carriers, because of their quarantine
condition. This must be considered when physician de￾cides to screen for a XDR bacteria. Finally, we can regret
that a majority of patients did not undergo screening after
1 year, emphasizing the need for more monitoring and
prospective studies.
