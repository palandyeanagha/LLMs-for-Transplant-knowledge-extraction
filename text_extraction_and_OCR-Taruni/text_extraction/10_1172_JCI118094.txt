Abstract
IFN-y and TNF-a, potent inhibitors of hematopoiesis, in￾duce nitric oxide synthase (NOS) in various cell types. When
normal human bone marrow (BM) or CD34+ cells were
exposed to NO, inhibition of colony formation was dose
dependent and direct. NO induced apoptosis in BM progeni￾tors, as shown by electrophoretic detection of DNA degrada￾tion and deoxynucleotidyl transferase assay. Using PCR and
immunoprecipitation, we found inducible NOS (iNOS)
mRNA and iNOS protein in BM after stimulation with IFN￾y or TNF-a. iNOS mRNA was also detected by PCR in
highly purified CD34+ cells; TNF-a or ILFN-y increased
iNOS expression. The presence of iNOS in CD34+ cells was
confirmed in single cells by immunochemical staining.
NG-Monomethyl-L-arginine (MM-Arg), an NOS inhibitor,
partially reversed the effects of TNF-a and, to a lesser ex￾tent, IFN-y in methylcellulose culture of total BM and
CD34+ cells, and inhibited apoptosis of BM cells induced
by these cytokines. When the effects of competitive iNOS
inhibition were tested on more immature progenitors, MM￾Arg increased the number of long-term BM culture-initiat￾ing cells in control cultures but failed to protect these cells
from the inhibitory action of IFN-y and TNF-a. Our results
suggest that NO may be one mediator of cytokine-induced
hematopoietic suppression. (J. Clin. Invest. 1995. 96:1085-

as a signaling molecule (4-6) as well as a toxic effector (7-
10). NO mediates activation or inhibition of various enzyme
systems (6, 11), DNA damage (12-15), and oxidative reac￾tions (16-21), with a variety of biologic effects, including
killing of microorganisms (22), antiviral activity (23), and
cytostasis and cell death (2, 3, 7-10, 24).
Expression of the inducible form of NOS (25, 26) is regu￾lated by cytokines, including IFN-y and TNF-a. TNF-a and
IFN-y enhance expression of inducible NOS (iNOS) and NO
production in a variety of cell types (27-31). The promoter
region of iNOS contains several sequences that potentially bind
IFN-y-induced transcription factors, including an interferon
regulatory factor-i (IRF-1) binding element (32, 33). IRF-1
induced by IFN-y binds to the promoter region of the iNOS
gene (34) and enhances iNOS mRNA expression (33, 34). A
different activation pathway involving NF-KB/Rel that has been
proposed for LPS may also operate for TNF-a-mediated induc￾tion of iNOS (35). Because some of the biologic effects of
IFN-y and TNF-a are similar to those described for NO, they
may be due to cytokine-mediated induction of NO in the target
cells.
A pathophysiologic role of NO has been proposed for sev￾eral autoimmune diseases (7-9, 36). TNF-a and IFN-y sup￾press hematopoietic progenitor cell proliferation (37-40) and
have been implicated in the mechanism of bone marrow (BM)
failure (41-48). In aplastic anemia, aberrant production of
IFN-'y (42, 43) and upregulation of TNF-P (44) in normal
human bone marrow likely induce apoptosis of hematopoietic
stem cells and progenitor cells. IFN-y and TNF-a suppress both
early and late stages of hematopoiesis and induce programmed
cell death (C. Selleri, S. Anderson, N. Young, and J. Maciejew￾ski, manuscript submitted for publication). Involvement of IFN￾y and TNF-a in the regulation of NO production suggested that
NO may influence the function of BM and may be relevant for
understanding the pathophysiology of hematologic diseases.
Methods
BM cell preparation. BM was obtained from healthy volunteers by
aspiration from the posterior iliac crest into syringes containing Iscove's
modified Dulbecco's medium (IMDM; GIBCO BRL, Gaithersburg,
MD) supplemented 1:10 with preservative-free heparin (O'Neill and
Feldman, St. Louis, MO). Informed consent was obtained according to
a protocol approved by the Institutional Review Board of the National
Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. Mononuclear BM cells were isolated
by density gradient centrifugation using lymphocyte separation medium
(Organon, Durham, NC). After washing in HBSS (GIBCO BRL),
cells were resuspended in IMDM supplemented with 20% FCS
(GIBCO BRL).
Separation of CD34 + cells. CD34 + cells were separated using affin￾ity chromatography (Cellpro, Bothell, WA) and flow cytometry. Briefly,
nonadherent BM cells were incubated at room temperature with murine
Effects of Nitric Oxide on Hematopoiesis 1085

anti-human CD34 IgM, washed in PBS, and incubated with streptavi￾din-conjugated goat F(ab')2 anti-mouse IgM. After washing with PBS
supplemented with 2% human albumin, cells were applied to an affinity
column containing biotin-coated beads, and the CD34+ cell fraction
was eluted with PBS. An aliquot of the eluted cells was stained with
phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-CD34 HPCA-2 monoclonal antibody
(Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA) to assess the purity of the
eluted cells. Usually, 70-90% of separated cells were CD34'. For
higher purity preparations, cells were further fractionated; column-puri￾fied cells were stained with FITC-labeled anti-CD34+ mAb (Becton
Dickinson), washed with PBS, and sorted by microfluorometry (Epics
V; Coulter, Hialeah, FL). The purity of cells obtained by combining
affinity chromatography and flow cytometry was 97-99%.
Hematopoietic cell culture. For short-term suspension cultures,
CD34+ BM cells were cultured in 96 round-bottom well plates at a
density of 5 x 104 cells/ml (1 x 104 cells/well) in medium consisting
of IMDM, 20% FCS, 50 ng/ml IL-3 (Genzyme, Boston, MA), 50
ng/ml stem cell factor (Amgen, Thousand Oaks, CA), and 2 U/ml
erythropoietin (Ortho, Raritan, NJ). TNF-a and IFN-y were obtained
from Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN. Diethylenetriamine
(DETA) was purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co. (Milwaukee, WI).
Its adduct with NO (DETA/NO) was prepared as previously described
(49). Its structure is H2NCH2CH2N [N(O)NO] -CH2CH2NH3', and its
Chemical Abstracts registry number is 146724-94-9. The half-life of
DETA/NO in pH 7.4 buffer at 370C is 20 h (50), and 2 mol of NO
are released for each mol of DETA/NO that hydrolyzes (49). NG￾Monomethyl-L-arginine (MM-Arg) was purchased from Calbiochem
(San Diego, CA), and 3-aminobenzamide was obtained from Sigma
Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO).
Long-term BM cultures (LTBMCs) were performed according to a
previously described method (51, 52). 1 X 107 mononuclear BM cells
were used to initiate LTBMC. Culture medium consisted of stem cell
medium (Terry Fox Laboratory, Vancouver, Canada) supplemented
with 1 X 10-6 M hydrocortisone hemisuccinate (Sigma Chemical Co.).
After 1 wk of culture at 37°C, the incubator temperature was changed
to 33°C. Medium changes were performed weekly. Nonadherent cells
were removed from the dishes, washed, and counted; half the cells were
returned to the original dishes, and the other half were used in re-plating
experiments to measure the output of clonogenic progenitors. TNF-a
and IFN-y were added weekly at appropriate concentrations. After 5
wk of culture, nonadherent cells were harvested using trypsin (GIBCO
BRL), washed, and replated in methylcellulose to estimate the numbers
of long term culture-initiating cells (LTCICs). The number of clono￾genic cells was converted to the absolute number of LTCIC by dividing
by 4 (52, 53).
Hematopoietic progenitors were measured in methylcellulose cul￾tures. Freshly isolated or previously cultured BM cells were placed in
methylcellulose in the presence of 50 ng/mi IL-3 (Genzyme), 20 ng/
ml GM-CSF (Boehringer Mannheim), 50 ng/ml stem cell factor, and
2 U/ml erythropoietin (Amgen). Total BM cells were plated at a density
of 1 x 105 cells in 1-ml culture medium in 35-mm dishes. CD34+ cells
were cultured at a density of 1 x 103 cells/0.5 ml methylcellulose in 48-
well plates. TNF-a and IFN-y were added to the culture at appropriate
concentrations. All cultures were performed in duplicate. All experimen￾tal procedures were performed in endotoxin-free plasticware; according
to the manufacturers' information, the levels of endotoxin contamination
in the cytokine preparations and mAb were 3 endotoxin U/mg by the
limulus assay, and antibodies used in all experiments contained < 1 ng/
ml of endotoxin. As a negative control for flow cytometry experiments,
isotype-matched mAb were employed (Dako, Carpinteria, CA).
Apoptosis assays. DNA fragmentation was measured after extraction
of low molecular weight DNA. 2 X 106 cells were resuspended in 900
M1 1 X Tris-EDTA buffer (Quality Biological, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD)
and lysed with 25 td 20% SDS (54). High molecular weight DNA was
precipitated for 6 h in the presence of 5 M NaCl. The high molecular
weight fraction was pelleted by high-speed centrifugation, and the frag￾mented DNA was extracted from the aqueous phase with phenol and
chloroform and then precipitated with ethanol. After resuspension in
water, DNA was electrophoresed using 1.5% agarose gel and visualized
by ethidium bromide staining.
To quantitate the number of cells undergoing apoptosis, cells were
harvested, fixed with 4% neutral buffered formalin, and cytocentrifuged
onto siliconized slides. Apoptotic cells were stained using the terminal
deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) method (Apotag; Oncor, Gaithers￾burg, MD). Endogenous peroxidase was first quenched with 0.5% hy￾drogen peroxide, and the cells were permeabilized using company-sup￾plied equilibration buffer. The 3' OH ends of degraded DNA were
reacted with TdT and digoxygenin-labeled ATP for 30 min. After wash￾ing with PBS, slides were reacted with an anti-digoxygenin mAb conju￾gated to peroxidase, washed, and developed with 3,3 '-diaminobenzidine
tetrahydrochloride (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Stained cells were counted
using a light microscope.
Reverse transcription PCR for human iNOS. Total RNA was ex￾tracted from constant numbers of mononuclear marrow cells and CD34 +
cells using RNAsol (Cinna/Biotecx, Friendswood, TX). Contaminating
DNA was digested using RNase-free DNaseI (Boehringer Mannheim).
RNA was reextracted with phenol and chloroform, precipitated with
ethanol, and diluted in RNase-free water. After reverse transcription
using oligo(dT)16 primer, iNOS cDNA was amplified using primers 5'
CGGTGCTGTATTY CCTTACGAGGCGAAGAAGG 3' and 5' GGT￾GCTGCTTGTTAGGAGGTCAAGTAAAGGGC 3' specific for iNOS
and primers specific for human /3-actin. The PCR products were electro￾phoresed on 1.2% agarose gels and transferred onto nytran filters
(Schleicher & Schuell, Keene, NH). The blots were then hybridized
with an internal oligonucleotide 5' labeled with 32p using T4-kinase
(Boehringer Mannheim). After washing under stringent conditions (0.1
x SSC, 0.5% SDS), membranes were exposed to x-ray film and devel￾oped.
Immunocytochemical staining and immunoprecipitation. BM cells
were starved for 2 h in methionine- and cysteine-deficient medium
containing 2% dialysed FCS, washed, and resuspended in the medium
containing 2 uCi/ml of [35S] methionine and cysteine (Trans-label; ICN
Biomedicals, Irvine, CA). Total BM cells were cultured for 24 h in the
presence of TNF-a or IFN-y, lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation buffer,
and, after addition of mouse serum, cleared for 2 h with protein-A
agarose (Boehringer Mannheim). After overnight incubation with 2 jg
of mouse anti-mouse iNOS peptide 961-1144 monoclonal IgG with
cross-reactivity to human iNOS (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington,
KY), cell lysates were incubated with rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Pierce)
for 2 h and reacted with 30 p1 protein-A agarose suspension for 2 h.
After multiple washing steps, agarose-bound complexes were denatured
by boiling in loading buffer containing 1% mercaptoethanol, electropho￾resed on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide, and either transferred onto nitrocellu￾lose membranes (Novex, San Diego, CA) or vacuum-dried and exposed
to x-ray film. After blocking for 2 h (Superblock; Pierce), blots were
reacted with 2 pg of mouse anti-iNOS mAb (Transduction Laboratories)
over night and developed with alkaline-phosphatase-conjugated rabbit
anti-mouse IgG (Pierce) for 2 h. Bands of 130 kD corresponded to
the human iNOS.
For immunocytochemistry, cultured purified CD34 + cells were
washed in PBS and cytocentrifuged onto siliconized slides. After fixa￾tion with ice-cold 50:50 methanol/acetone for 10 min, slides were
blocked with PBS-containing 10% normal goat serum, reacted with
rabbit anti-human iNOS peptide IgG purified from antiserum (kindly
provided by Merck Research Laboratories, West Point, PA) and devel￾oped with Texas red-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Vector Lab, Burl￾ingame, CA). Immunizing peptide was used to block anti-human iNOS
polypeptide IgG. As positive controls, 293 cells transfected with human
iNOS cDNA were used (25).

Effects ofNO on colonyformation ofmarrow cells in methylcel￾lulose cultures. To test the effects of NO on the growth of
marrow cells in vitro, we used DETA/NO, a compound which

at neutral pH spontaneously releases NO into the solution with
a half-life of 20 h at 370C. When DETA/NO was added to
methylcellulose cultures of CD34' cells, both myeloid and ery￾throid cells decreased in colony-forming ability (Fig. 1 A). To
exclude the possibility that the inhibition of colony formation
was due to the carrier molecule, DETA, or to nitrite generated
in the medium from released NO, both substances were added
to the culture as controls. No effect on colony formation was
observed with DETA and nitrite used at appropriate concentra￾tions (Fig. 1 B). The inhibitory effect of NO was dose depen￾dent. The presence of accessory cells was not required for
DETA/NO suppression. The CD34' cell population used in
this experiment includes committed and primitive progenitor
cells (55, 56).
NO-mediated hematopoietic inhibition is associated with
the induction of apoptosis of BM cells. The observed suppres￾sion of colony formation by NO could be due to a reversible
inhibition of progenitor cell cycling without loss of viability or
to the induction of cell death. Analysis of low molecular weight
DNA extracted from total BM cultured in suspension in the
presence of the NO-releasing compound DETA/NO showed a
nucleosomal DNA degradation pattern on agarose gels stained
with ethidium bromide characteristic of apoptosis (Fig. 2). Low
molecular weight DNA extracted from the same number of cells
cultured in the presence of DETA as a control reagent did
not show this pattern. Furthermore, 3-aminobenzamide, a poly￾ADP-ribose synthetase inhibitor, suppressed the apoptotic deg-

NO-induced programmed cell death was detectable within the
first 24 h of culture. To test whether hematopoietic progenitors
were affected by the action of NO, we added DETA/NO to the
cultures of highly purified CD34+ BM cells. Using the in situ
TdT method, we demonstrated that NO induced apoptosis of
CD34+ cells in culture (Fig. 3).
Expression of iNOS in marrow cells stimulated by IFN-y
or TNF-a. Because NO inhibited BM cell proliferation, and
iNOS, a key enzyme in the synthesis of NO, can be induced in
a variety of cell types with TNF-a or IFN-y, we tested whether
these cytokines regulated the expression of iNOS in BM cells.
Using PCR, we demonstrated the presence of iNOS mRNA in
cultured unstimulated total BM cells. A very strong signal was
obtained from cells cultured in the presence of TNF-a and IFN￾y (data not shown). Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot of
cell lysates demonstrated that BM cells expressed low levels of
iNOS, and the expression of this enzyme was enhanced by IFN￾y and TNF-a (Fig. 4 B). Because the iNOS signal in total BM
cells might be due to the presence of accessory cells, we tested
whether more immature cells contained in the CD34 + cell popu￾lation expressed iNOS. To minimize the possibility of contami￾nation with mature cells potentially expressing iNOS, we used
preparations containing 98% CD34+ cells. Simultaneous stain￾ing with CD14 mAb, specific for monocytes and macrophages,
and anti-CD2 mAb for lymphocytes, showed less than 3% of
CD14+ and 2% of CD2+ cells in CD34+ cell preparations
used for PCR. iNOS mRNA was detectable in the CD34 + cells
cultured for 24 h in medium alone, and IFN-y- or TNF-a￾stimulated cells showed a stronger amplification signal (Fig. 4
A). Immunocytochemical staining with human iNOS-specific
antiserum of CD34+ cells confirmed the presence of iNOS pro￾tein at the single cell level in freshly purified CD34 + cells from
some donors. The presence of iNOS protein in a proportion of
cultured CD34+ cells was consistent with the PCR results, with
low untreated and cytokine-enhanced expression of iNOS in
CD34 + cells (Fig. 4, C and D). To determine if more immature
progenitors, defined by the expression of CD38 antigen, con￾tained iNOS mRNA, we sorted CD34+CD38wh (Fig. 5 A) and
CD34+CD38d'- (Fig. 5 B) cells and performed RT-PCR on
both cell fractions. Human iNOS mRNA was detectable both
in less mature CD34+CD38am and in mature CD34+CD38"'gh
BM cells (Fig. 5 C).

Effects of inhibition of iNOS on the proliferation of BM
progenitors. Because NO inhibited hematopoietic colony for￾mation and IFN-y and/or TNF-a increased the expression of
iNOS in BM progenitors, we tested whether the inhibitory ef￾fects of these cytokines were related to NO production. Addition
of MM-Arg, a competitive inhibitor of iNOS, to methylcellulose
cultures of total BM cells partially reversed the suppressive
effects of IFN-y and/or TNF-a on colony growth (Table I).
MM-Arg showed more pronounced effects on cultures that in￾cluded TNF-a. Parallel results were obtained in colony cultures
from CD34+ cells (Table I). Similar degrees of inhibition by
IFN-y and TNF-a were observed for both erythroid and myeloid
series. Within myeloid subsets combining granulocytic, macro￾phage, and granulocytic-monocytic colonies, preferential sur￾vival of macrophage colonies after IFN-y and TNF-a was seen
in both total and CD34 + cell cultures. In cultures supplemented
with MM-Arg, granulocytic, macrophage, and granulocytic￾monocytic colonies were represented at similar proportions as
in control cultures (data not shown).
In suspension cultures of total BM and purified CD34+
cells, MM-Arg also partially prevented IFN-y- and TNF-a￾induced apoptosis (Fig. 6).
To determine whether cytokine-mediated NO production
showed differential inhibitory effects on less mature

IFN-y and TNF-a, with or without MM-Arg. After 7 d of
culture, cells were counted to estimate the effects of MM-Arg
on overall proliferation. Although the proliferative capacity of
CD34+CD38dim cells is lower than that of CD34+CD38"'9
cells, IFN-y and TNEF-a showed inhibitory effects on both cell
populations. In the presence of 500 [SM MM-Arg, the inhibi￾tory effects of the cytokines were less pronounced (for IFN-y,
48 vs 26% inhibition in cultures of CD34+CD38 Igh and 15 vs
5% in cultures of CD34+CD38&im cells, without or with MM￾Arg, respectively; for TNF-a, 36 vs 0% inhibition in cultures
of CD34 + CD38high and 39 vs 0% in cultures of CD34 + CD38dim
cells without or with MM-Arg, respectively). To determine the
effects of MM-Arg on the numbers of colony-forming pro￾genitors in these cultures after stimulation with IFN-y and
TNF-a, cells derived from primary suspension cultures of
CD34+CD38'm and CD34+CD38'gh cells were placed in
methylcellulose, and after 14 d the colony numbers were
counted (pre-CFU-assay). MM-Arg failed to protect against
the IFN-y-induced decrease in the numbers of colony forming
cells, and the protective effect of MM-Arg on the number of
colony-forming cells in cultures with TNF-a was less pro￾nounced than the effects seen in the primary methylcellulose
assays (data not shown).
Because clonogenic assays measure the function of commit￾ted progenitors, we used LTBMC to study the protective'effects
of MM-Arg on more immature progenitors (Table II). When
the output of CFU in LTBMC was measured in sequentially
performed replating experiments, MM-Arg showed effects simi￾lar to those obtained with primary methylcellulose culture. MM￾1088 Maciejewski, Selleri, Sato, Cho, Keefer, Nathan, and Young

cell fractions were used for mRNA extraction and subjected to RT￾PCR. Human iNOS and /3-actin amplification products were electropho￾resed in agarose gels and stained with ethidium bromide (C).
Arg increased the numbers of CFU in control cultures by 40%
in week 1, 36% at week 2, and 30% at week 3, in comparison
with treated control cultures. A protective effect on inhibition
of CFU production by IFN-'y and TNF-a was seen; the numbers
of CFU measured in the nonadherent cell fraction after week 1
were completely restored. A lesser effect of MM-Arg on CFU
output was seen in week 2 (19 and 39% higher CFU numbers
with IFN-y and TNF-a, respectively) and week 3 (32 and
46% higher CFU numbers for IFN-y and TNF-a) of LTBMC.
Although the presence of MM-Arg in LTBMC increased the
total output of CFU in cultures not treated with WFN-y and
TNF-a, cytokine-suppression of LTCIC survival was unaffected
(Table II). Similar to the primary methylcellulose assay, surviv￾ing myeloid colony-forming cells in IFN--y and TNF-a were
predominantly of the macrophage type (data not shown).
Discussion
We studied cytokine pathways leading to the induction of NO
production and NO effects on human hematopoiesis in vitro.
NO decreased colony formation by total human BM and purified
CD34' cell preparations, demonstrating that the effects of NO
were direct with regard to a cell population containing hemato￾poietic progenitor cells (55, 56). The detection of apoptosis in
these experiments, in both total BM and CD34 + cells, suggests
that the suppressive effects of NO may be at least partially
attributed to irreversible cytotoxicity. In the presence of IFN-y
and/or TNF-a, iNOS expression appeared to be enhanced not
only in total BM containing mature accessory cells but also in
the immature cells defined by the CD34 surface antigen. Al￾though in isolated CD34+ cells the expression of iNOS showed
some variability, there was a concordance between iNOS ex￾pression and the presence of cytokines in culture in both iNOS￾specific RT-PCR and immunocytochemistry performed on

65±9 myeloid colonies for CGD34' cells. The number of colonies in CD34' cell cultures at 250 jIM MM-Arg was 91 ± 12% (erythroid) and 107± 10%
(myeloid) of control, and, at 500 AM MM-Arg, 107±12% (erythroid) and 105±7% (myeloid) of control. Since addition of MM-Arg influenced
colony formation, the percentage of inhibition of colony formation in the samples with cytokines and MM-Arg was calculated using MM-Arg alone
as control. For comparison, colony formation by total BM cells at 250 jzM MM-Arg was 74±3% (erythroid) and 81±5% (myeloid) of control and,
in the presence of 500 jAM MM-Arg, 91±16% (erythroid) and 88±8% (myeloid) of control. Statistical analysis (paired t test), comparing cytokine
vs. cytokine + MM-Arg: * P < 0.05, t P < 0.01.

partial, other intracellular mechanisms triggered by IFN-y or
TNF-a may contribute to their antiproliferative actions on BM
progenitors. Such mechanisms include inhibition of cell cycling
and induction of apoptosis by not only nitrogen radicals but
also reactive oxygen species (62, 63) and by other signaling
pathways.
Overexpression of IFN-y and TNF-a in BM has been de￾scribed in some BM failure disorders (42-48). Increased pro￾duction of NO due to the action of these cytokines during dis￾ease may acutely result in induction of apoptosis of progenitor
cells as demonstrated by our in vitro experiments. Programmed
cell death may reflect a physiologic reaction protective against
accumulated DNA damage. Although the mutagenicity of NO
is still a matter of controversy, chronically elevated NO produc￾tion could overwhelm normal DNA repair mechanisms and re￾sult in somatic mutations. Similar mechanisms may also act
in connection with oxygen radicals generated in response to
inflammatory stimuli. Further experimentation is needed to test
whether production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species can
lead to mutations associated with malignancies.
