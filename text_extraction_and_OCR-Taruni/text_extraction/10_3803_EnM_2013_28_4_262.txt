Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) is secreted from enteroendocrine L-cells in response to oral nutrient intake and elicits glucose￾stimulated insulin secretion while suppressing glucagon secretion. It also slows gastric emptying, which contributes to decreased 
postprandial glycemic excursions. In the 1990s, chronic subcutaneous infusion of GLP-1 was found to lower blood glucose levels 
in patients with type 2 diabetes. However, GLP-1’s very short half-life, arising from cleavage by the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase 
4 (DPP-4) and glomerular filtration by the kidneys, presented challenges for clinical use. Hence, DPP-4 inhibitors were devel￾oped, as well as several GLP-1 analogs engineered to circumvent DPP-4-mediated breakdown and/or rapid renal elimination. 
Three categories of GLP-1 analogs, are being developed and/or are in clinical use: short-acting, long-acting, and prolonged-act￾ing GLP-1 analogs. Each class has different plasma half-lives, molecular size, and homology to native GLP-1, and consequently 
different characteristic effects on glucose metabolism. In this article, we review current clinical data derived from each class of 
GLP-1 analogs, and consider the clinical effects reported for each category in recent head to head comparison studies. Given the 
relatively brief clinical history of these compounds, we also highlight several important efficacy and safety issues which will re￾quire further investigation.

INTRODUCTION
Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is an incretin hormone se￾creted from enteroendocrine L-cells, which in turn stimulates 
insulin secretion, suppresses glucagon secretion, and slows 
gastric emptying. As a result of these glucose-lowering activi￾ties, intense effort has been directed toward taking advantage 
of GLP-1 for the treatment of diabetes. In 1992, it was first re￾vealed that acute intravenous GLP-1 infusion (for 30 or 210 
minutes) significantly reduced postprandial hyperglycemia in 
patients with type 2 diabetes [1,2]. Soon thereafter, GLP-1 was 
found to normalize basal glucose levels when infused intrave￾nously for 4 hours during the fasting state in patients with type 
2 diabetes who showed poor metabolic control and elevated 
hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) despite sulfonylurea therapy [3]. 
Further proof of concept for GLP-1 as a chronic treatment for 
type 2 diabetes came through a study by Zander et al. [4], in 
which subjects with type 2 diabetes received continuous infu￾sion of GLP-1 for 6 weeks via subcutaneous mini-pump. GLP￾1 infusion decreased fasting and 8 hours mean plasma glucose

levels, HbA1c levels, and body weight, while improving insu￾lin sensitivity and β cell function [4].
Despite these promising initial results, native GLP-1’s ame￾nability to clinical exploitation is limited by two hurdles which 
together shorten its biological half-life to just a few minutes. 
Firstly, exogenous and endogenous GLP-1 is rapidly inactivat￾ed in vivo by dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4), which recognizes 
Ala or Pro at the second position of the amino acid sequence of 
a peptide and removes dipeptides from the N-terminus [5-7]. 
This rapid degradation results in a plasma half-life of less than 
2 minutes for exogenously administered GLP-1 [8]. To avoid 
degradation by DPP-4 and extend GLP-1’s circulating half-life, 
several GLP-1 analogs are currently used. These include natu￾rally DPP-4 resistant GLP-1 analogs (e.g., exendin-4); synthet￾ic GLP-1 analogs substituting the second amino acid for one 
not recognized by DPP-4 (e.g., albiglutide containing Gly [9], 
taspoglutide containing aminoisobutyric acid [10], and CJC￾1131 containing D-Ala [11] at the second amino acid position); 
and GLP-1 analogs conjugated to large molecules to shield the 
DPP-4 cleavage site (e.g., liraglutide, containing a C16 fatty 
acid conjugated to albumin [12]). Even when GLP-1 analogs 
or modified forms of GLP-1 can escape DPP-4 attack, they re￾main prone to renal elimination given GLP-1’s small molecular 
size (~3.4 kDa) [13], providing a second means by which GLP￾1’s plasma half-life is limited. However, by conjugating to a 
large carrier moiety, GLP-1 and its DPP-4 resistant analogs can 
escape glomerular filtration. Liraglutide forms noncovalent 
bonds to albumin (molecular weight, ~67 kDa) through a C16
fatty acid chain [14]. Albiglutide [9] and dulaglutide [15,16] 
are DPP-4 resistant GLP-1 analogs in which the basic structure 
of human GLP-1 is conjugated to recombinant human albumin 
or a modified Fc fragment of immunoglobulin G (IgG4; mo￾lecular weight, ~56 kDa), respectively. Another strategy to in￾crease GLP-1’s biological half-life is to incorporate a DPP-4 
resistant GLP-1 analog into a polymer or other container en￾abling sustained release. A long-acting release (LAR) prepara￾tion of exenatide (a synthetic form of exendin-4) has been de￾veloped for once weekly injection by incorporating it into a 
poly (D,L-lactic-co-glycolic acid) microsphere suspension with 
biodegradable microparticles [17]. In addition, a continuous 
delivery system for exenatide is currently under development 
and will use a matchstick-size miniature osmotic pump device, 
implanted into the subcutaneous tissue [18]. Sustained release 
preparations of GLP-1 and its analogs are expected to increase 
patient compliance and decrease gastrointestinal side effects 
[17-19].
CLINICAL EXPLOITATION OF GLP-1’S 
ANTI-DIABETIC EFFECTS: GLP-1 
MIMETICS AND GLP-1 ENHANCERS
GLP-1 based therapy can be classified into GLP-1 mimetics 
and GLP-1 enhancers (Fig. 1). Peptide GLP-1 mimetics can be 
further subdivided into GLP-1-based analogs (-glutides) and 
exendin-4-based analogs (-xenatides), as reviewed elsewhere 
[20]. Small molecule GLP-1 receptor agonists, ideally orally 
bioavailable, could be a fascinating new approach for activat￾ing GLP-1 receptor signaling while mimicking the natural 
route of GLP-1 absorption and distribution and eliminating the 
need for injections [20]. The substituted cyclobutane Boc5, for 
example, is a small molecule GLP-1 receptor agonist that stim￾ulates insulin secretion in vivo and reduces HbA1c levels and 
weight gain when delivered to db/db mice by chronic injection 
[21,22]. Although Boc5 is orally absorbable, its oral bioavail￾ability is limited [23].
GLP-1 enhancers include DPP-4 inhibitors and GLP-1 se￾cretagogues. Thus far, DPP-4 inhibition, which increases active 
GLP-1 levels by inhibiting GLP-1 breakdown, remains the 
most widely investigated strategy for enhancing GLP-1 levels 
[24,25]. Although DPP-4 inhibitors are now common in clini￾cal practice, they increase active GLP-1 levels only to a modest 
degree, and are not specific to GLP-1; they modulate the break￾down of other molecules that are sensitive to DPP-4, including 
glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and others. Thus 
research is now being directed at alternative strategies for in￾creasing endogenous GLP-1 secretion, including stimulating 
G-protein coupled receptors expressed in L-cells such as TGR5 
[26,27] and GPR119 [28]. Whether such approaches yield ad￾ditive or synergistic effects with DPP-4 inhibitors remains to 
be seen.
GLP-1 ANALOGS
In the current review we will focus on recent clinical findings 
related to the use of GLP-1 analogs, which can be classified 
into three categories according to their duration of action [29]. 
Detailed information on each drug is beyond the scope of this 
review; the reader is referred to recent reviews for greater depth 
[20,30]. The first generation of GLP-1 analogs to be developed 
were short-acting, typically necessitating twice-daily injection 
(e.g., exenatide). The second generation of GLP-1 analogs are 
long-acting, with sufficient duration of activity for a once daily 
injection regimen (e.g., liraglutide). The third generation are

prolonged-acting GLP-1 analogs, with sustained action requir￾ing a dosing regimen ranging from once-weekly to once￾monthly injection (e.g., exenatide-LAR or exenatide once 
weekly). The efficacy and safety profiles of short-, long-, and 
prolonged-acting GLP-1 analogs (exenatide, liraglutide, or ex￾enatide LAR, respectively) were recently evaluated in a meta￾analysis including 25 randomized controlled trials. The reduc￾tion in HbA1c was 1.1% to 1.2% from baseline in patients 
treated with these compounds, with 46% to 63% of participants 
achieving the target HbA1c goal of <7% and an increased risk 
of hypoglycemia reported only with concomitant use of a sul￾fonylurea [31]. The most commonly reported nonglycemic ad￾verse effects were gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea 
(~30%), vomiting (~10%), and diarrhea (~12%) [32]. In addi￾tion, more weight loss was observed with GLP-1 analogs com￾pared to placebo or other antidiabetic drugs [31]. In another 
meta-analysis including 25 randomized controlled trials involv￾ing exenatide, liraglutide, or exenatide LAR, the weighted 
mean change in body weight in treated individuals compared to 
controls was -2.9 kg (95% confidence interval, -3.6 to -2.2) 
[32]. GLP-1 analogs also reduced systolic and diastolic blood 
pressure and total cholesterol levels [32]. Taken together, these 
data highlight the favorable effects of GLP-1 analogs on glyce￾mic profile as well as body weight and cardiovascular risk. 
Whether GLP-1 analogs reduce cardiovascular events will be 
determined by important clinical trials currently underway 
(e.g., EXSCEL for exenatide and LEADER for liraglutide) 
[33].

ic isolated from the saliva of the Gila monster (Heloderma su￾spectum). It consists of 39 amino acids, bearing 53% sequence 
homology to GLP-1, and has a plasma half-life of ~3 to 4 
hours owing to clearance primarily by glomerular filtration 
and subsequent degradation [34-36]. In animal studies, exena￾tide increases expression of genes known to be critical for β 
cell function, and enhances β cell mass by stimulating β cell 
proliferation and/or neogenesis and also by suppressing apop￾tosis [37-39]. Exenatide restores first-phase insulin secretion 
and augments second-phase insulin secretion when infused in￾travenously along with glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes 
[40]. It also suppresses inappropriately increased plasma glu￾cagon levels after meals in patients with type 2 diabetes [41] 
and delays gastric emptying, which plays a critical role in con￾trolling postprandial hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes, follow￾ing solid and liquid meals [42]. 
Exenatide improves glucose handling in patients with type 2 
diabetes who have been poorly responsive to lifestyle modifi￾cation, sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, metformin, and com￾binations of these treatments [43]. Exenatide exhibited similar 
glucose lowering efficacy to long-acting insulin glargine in pa￾tients with type 2 diabetes with suboptimal glycemic control 
despite metformin and sulfonylurea treatment [44]. While insu￾lin glargine primarily reduced fasting glucose levels and actu￾ally increased body weight, exenatide decreased fed glucose 
levels and body weight while also reducing risk of nocturnal 
hypoglycemia [44]. Furthermore, when exenatide was added to 
insulin glargine in patients with suboptimally controlled type 2 
diabetes, it improved glycemic control without increasing risk 
of hypoglycemia or weight gain [45]. 
For the management of chronic diseases such as diabetes, 
the durability of treatment effect is crucial. In this regard, ex￾enatide-induced improvements in glycemic control were sus￾tained over 3 years in an analysis combining three open label, 
placebo-controlled trials [46]. Twice daily exenatide treatment 
combined with metformin maintained glycemic control for 
longer periods and in a higher proportion of treated patients 
than glimepiride in an open-label, randomized controlled 
study in patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes 
with up to 4.5 years of follow-up [47]. A progressive decrease 
in body weight was also observed for up to 3 years in exena￾tide-treated patients [46,48].
The most common adverse effects reported during clinical 
trials with exenatide are gastrointestinal symptoms including 
vomiting, nausea, and diarrhea, as well as mild to moderate 
hypoglycemia [44,49-51]. The frequency of gastrointestinal 
adverse effects decreases over time after the initial 8 weeks 
treatment period [44,49-51]. Since the sequence homology be￾tween exenatide and human GLP-1 is only 53%, 40% to 60% 
of patients develop antiexenatide antibodies, though in most 
cases antibody development does not reduce the efficacy of 
exenatide treatment [44,49-51]. Patients with high antiexena￾tide antibody titers do experience some attenuation of exena￾tide’s glycemic improvement but remain responsive to liraglu￾tide, suggesting that antiexenatide antibodies do not cross-re￾act with GLP-1 analogs bearing much closer homology to hu￾man GLP-1 [52]. There remains significant controversy over 
whether exenatide might increase the risk of acute pancreatitis 
or pancreatic cancer [53,54]; patients should be cautiously 
monitored for these potential adverse effects until the debate 
on this issue is resolved.
Lixisenatide
Lixisenatide is an analog of exendin-4 consisting of 44 amino 
acids, with substitution of Pro38 and Ser39 to Ser38, and Lys39, 
respectively, and with five additional Lys residues added to the 
C-terminus [14]. The plasma half-life of lixisenatide is ap￾proximately 3 hours in humans [55], which is similar to that of 
exenatide [34-36]. It is being developed as a single daily dose 
injectable, since its HbA1c-lowering efficacy was found to be 
similar whether delivered as a 10 µg twice daily dose (before 
breakfast and before supper) or as a single 20 µg daily dose 
(before breakfast) in patients with type 2 diabetes [56]. Like 
exenatide, lixisenatide is also eliminated mainly through the 
kidneys [55]. In phase three clinical trials in patients with sub￾optimally controlled type 2 diabetes, lixisenatide exhibited a 
significant reduction in HbA1c with tolerable safety profile 
[57,58]. As lixisenatide is known to delay gastric emptying 
[14], a marked decrease in postprandial hyperglycemia was 
noted with lixisenatide [57,58], which is a characteristic prop￾erty of the short-acting GLP-1 analogs [30]. The GetGoal pro￾gram for phase three clinical trials with lixisenatide is current￾ly on-going.
Long-acting GLP-1 analogs
Liraglutide
Liraglutide is a GLP-1 analog with a C16 fatty acid chain at￾tached to the Lys26 residue via a Glu spacer and substitution of 
Lys34 to Arg34 [12]. The fatty acid chain forms noncovalent 
bonds to albumin, which presumably conceals the DPP-4 
cleavage site, prolonging the plasma half-life of liraglutide by 
increasing the compound’s mass and allowing it to escape glo-

merular filtration [12]. After subcutaneous injection, liraglu￾tide is slowly absorbed and has a half-life of 11 to 15 hours, 
making it suitable for once daily injection [59]. Since liraglu￾tide is not metabolized or eliminated by the kidneys or liver, 
its pharmacokinetics are not significantly affected by renal or 
hepatic dysfunction, providing a potential treatment advantage 
in patients with type 2 diabetes and concomitant kidney/liver 
disease [59]. Liraglutide reduces HbA1c and fasting and fed 
glucose levels in patients with type 2 diabetes by improving 
first-phase insulin secretion, suppressing postprandial gluca￾gon secretion, delaying gastric emptying, and increasing sati￾ety [59]. In a Japanese study using a continuous glucose moni￾tor, liraglutide induced impressive stabilization of 24-hour 
glucose profiles, particularly in drug-naïve patients with type 
2 diabetes [60]. The superior clinical efficacy of liraglutide as 
monotherapy and dual- or triple-drug combination therapy 
compared to placebo or active comparators (e.g., a sulfonyl￾urea, rosiglitazone, insulin glargine, and exenatide twice daily 
injection) was demonstrated by the Liraglutide Effect and Ac￾tion in Diabetes (LEAD) study program [59]. Briefly, patient￾level meta-analysis encompassing seven trials with two doses 
of liraglutide (n=4,625) revealed that 40% of the 1.8 mg lira￾glutide group, 32% of the 1.2 mg liraglutide group, and 6% to 
25% of the placebo or active comparator groups (i.e., rosigli￾tazone, glimepiride, insulin glargine, exenatide, and sita￾gliptin) attained a composite outcome of HbA1c <7%, no 
weight gain, and no hypoglycemic events [61]. Therefore, li￾raglutide effectively and safely achieves good glycemic con￾trol in patients with type 2 diabetes across a broad spectrum of 
clinical contexts.
Similar to other GLP-1 analogs, the most common adverse 
effects associated with liraglutide are nausea, vomiting, diar￾rhea, and mild hypoglycemia [59]. Reflecting the 97% amino 
acid homology between liraglutide and native human GLP-1, 
liraglutide is significantly less immunogenic than exenatide, 
with antiliraglutide antibodies detected in only 9% to 13% of 
treated patients, and no attenuation of liraglutide’s efficacy in 
these patients [62,63]. Although acute pancreatitis is a rare 
complication which may or may not be causally related to lira￾glutide treatment [59], cautious monitoring is warranted. Rats 
and mice treated with higher doses of liraglutide (~8-fold 
greater than clinical levels) showed increased incidence of ad￾enomas and carcinomas of the calcitonin-secreting thyroid C￾cell [64]. However, humans and monkeys express lower levels 
of the GLP-1 receptor in thyroid C-cells than rodents, and 
GLP-1 receptor agonists are unlikely to stimulate adenylate 
cyclase or increase calcitonin release in primates [65]. Fur￾thermore, in clinical trials with liraglutide, neither increased 
medullary thyroid carcinoma risk (originating from the thyroid 
C-cell nor significant increase of serum calcitonin (a biomark￾er of medullary thyroid carcinoma) levels has been reported 
[59]. Nonetheless, liraglutide is contraindicated for patients 
having a familial or personal history of medullary thyroid car￾cinoma or multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2 
(which includes medullary thyroid carcinoma as one compo￾nent) [59].
Prolonged-acting GLP-1 analogs
Exenatide once weekly
Exenatide LAR or exenatide once weekly is a prolonged-act￾ing GLP-1 analog (median half-life=2 weeks) in which ex￾enatide is incorporated into a 0.06 mm diameter microsphere 
composed of poly (D,L-lactic-co-glycolic acid) [66]. Thera￾peutic concentrations of exenatide are achieved after 2 weeks, 
while steady-state concentrations of exenatide in the plasma 
are reached after 6 to 10 weeks [17,67]. The efficacy and safe￾ty of exenatide LAR have been tested in various clinical set￾tings by the DURATION program, using metformin, sita￾gliptin, pioglitazone, insulin glargine, liraglutide, and exena￾tide twice daily as active comparators [68,69]. Exenatide LAR 
decreases HbA1c and fasting and postprandial plasma glucose 
levels, and reduces body weight in patients with suboptimally 
controlled type 2 diabetes [69]. Exenatide LAR exhibited bet￾ter or noninferior efficacy in lowering HbA1c than most active 
comparators (except liraglutide and pioglitazone) in the DU￾RATION program [69]. 
Like other classes of GLP-1 analogs, the most commonly 
reported adverse effects of exenatide LAR treatment include 
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and mild hypoglycemia [68,69]. 
Because of foreign body reaction against injected micro￾spheres, subcutaneous nodules are commonly found in treated 
patients, although these are usually transient and resolve spon￾taneously [66]. Injection site reactions including nodules, ery￾thema, and pruritus occur in 10% to 20% of treated patients 
[69]. In the DURATION-1 study, antiexenatide antibodies 
were more common in the exenatide LAR treated group 
(74.3%) than in the exenatide treated group (48.3%). Exena￾tide LAR exhibited durable glucose-lowering efficacy, with 
stable glucose improvements and reductions in cardiometa￾bolic risk factors for up to 3 years, and a tolerable safety pro￾file [70].

GLP-1 Receptor Agonism for Type 2 Diabetes Therapy

Albiglutide 
Albiglutide is a GLP-1 analog engineered by fusing recombi￾nant albumin to two tandem repeats of a DPP-4 resistant ana￾log of human GLP-1 which also bears an Ala to Gly substitu￾tion at the DPP-4 cleavage site [9]. Two tandem repeats of the 
GLP-1 analog are included in an attempt to compensate for a 
possible reduction in binding affinity of the GLP-1 moiety to 
the GLP-1 receptor due to its bulky structure when covalently 
bound to recombinant albumin [71]. Albiglutide is slowly ab￾sorbed following subcutaneous injection, with an extended 
half-life (~5 days) making it suitable for injection once weekly 
or even less frequently [71]. In a dose ranging study, weekly 
injection of albiglutide effectively and stably reduced fasting 
plasma glucose and HbA1c levels with less frequent nausea 
and vomiting compared to biweekly or monthly injection of 
albiglutide or twice daily exenatide injection [71]. Nonneutral￾izing anti-albiglutide antibodies were found in 2.5% of treated 
patients [71]. Albiglutide is currently undergoing phase three 
clinical trials (named the HARMONY program) and was sub￾mitted it to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for ap￾proval as of January 2013.
Dulaglutide 
Dulaglutide (LY2189265) is an additional prolonged-acting 
GLP-1 analog consisting of two identical DPP-4-resistant 
GLP-1 analogs covalently fused to an IgG4 Fc fragment via 
linker peptides [72]. The Fc fragment is modified to reduce 
Fcγ receptor binding affinity and immunogenic potential [16]. 
The kinetics of absorption of dulaglutide following subcutane￾ous injection are quite variable, with a Tmax ranging from 12 to 
72 hours and a plasma half-life of ~4 days, making it suitable 
for once weekly injection [15]. In patients with type 2 diabe￾tes, dulaglutide significantly reduced HbA1c, blood glucose, 
and body weight, and was well tolerated [72,73]. Nausea, 
vomiting, and diarrhea were the most commonly reported ad￾verse effects related to the dulaglutide treatment [15,72,73]. 
Phase three clinical trials for dulaglutide are currently under￾way.
Head to head comparison of GLP-1 analogs 
The clinical results achieved by short-, long, and prolonged￾acting GLP-1 analogs have now been tested across different 
studies and in direct head to head comparison studies. Some 
differences would reasonably be expected across drug catego￾ries due to their different duration of action, and indeed, such 
differences have been observed. For example, plasma levels of 
exenatide increase sharply after injection and fall to baseline 
within several hours because of its short half-life [74]. With its 
twice daily injection regimen, exenatide acts primarily to re￾duce glucose excursion after breakfast and supper, with mini￾mal effect on glucose levels after lunch or during fasting peri￾ods. In contrast, liraglutide and exenatide LAR exhibit steady 
state plasma levels over a 24 hour-period [17,59,67,74].
The duration of action of the different classes of GLP-1 an￾alogs also influences adverse events. While gastric emptying 
is delayed following initiation of continuous GLP-1 infusion, 
this effect is lost as early as 5 hours after initiation of therapy 
via modulation of vagal activity [75]. Therefore, delayed gas￾tric emptying might be attenuated with long- or prolonged￾acting GLP-1 analogs compared to short-acting GLP-1 ana￾logs. Indeed, gastric emptying time was more prolonged with 
exenatide compared to exenatide LAR in patients with type 2 
diabetes [17]. In addition to the different duration of action, 
different immunogenicity profiles across different classes of 
GLP-1 analogs could affect drug efficacy and safety profiles 
[52]. 
To address these issues, head to head comparisons of short-, 
long-, and prolonged-acting GLP-1 analogs have now been 
performed. Table 1 summarizes the results of three representa￾tive studies comparing different GLP-1 analogs [17,19,76]. 
All three GLP-1 analogs exhibited good efficacy in glycemic 
control. However, there were statistically significant differ￾ences in the degree of HbA1c reduction achieved in patients 
treated with exenatide, liraglutide, or exenatide LAR. HbA1c 
reduction was greatest with liraglutide [19,76], and greater 
with exenatide LAR than with exenatide [17]. The proportion 
of patients achieving the goal of HbA1c <7% showed a simi￾lar trend [17,19,76]. These observations are likely due to the 
fact that short-acting analogs primarily decrease postprandial 
glucose levels, whereas long- and prolonged-acting GLP-1 
analogs decrease primarily fasting glucose levels. Greater de￾creases in postprandial glucose levels were observed with ex￾enatide than with liraglutide or exenatide LAR [17,76]. This 
observation is likely a direct result of the pharmokinetic pro￾files of these compounds. Exenatide has a minimal effect on 
postlunch and overnight blood glucose control due to its short￾acting pharmacokinetics (Fig. 2); however, liraglutide and ex￾enatide LAR can exert effects during these periods, which 
may explain their better glucose-lowering efficacy [17,76].
Variable impacts on other physiological parameters are also 
observed across the different classes of GLP-1 analogs. In the 
LEAD-6 trial [76], pancreatic β cell function was assessed by

the homeostasis model based on fasting plasma insulin and 
glucose levels. β Cell function was higher with liraglutide than 
with exenatide, which may explain the better lower fasting 
glucose levels observed with liraglutide compared to exena￾tide. Moreover, switching to once daily liraglutide from twice 
daily exenatide further reduced HbA1c levels and fasting plas￾ma glucose levels [77]. All three GLP-1 analogs reduced body 
weight by 2.7 to 3.7 kg, with exenatide and exenatide LAR induc￾ing similar weight loss and liraglutide inducing greater weight loss 
than both exenatide and exenatide LAR [17,19,76]. The greater 
weight loss induced by liraglutide may contribute to this com￾pound’s greater capacity for HbA1c reduction compared to ex￾enatide LAR [19]. All three GLP-1 analogs also reduced sys￾tolic and diastolic blood pressure [17,19,76]. In general, long￾and prolonged-acting GLP-1 analogs increase heart rates while 
short-acting GLP-1 analogs do not [30]. In comparison studies, 
liraglutide increased heart rate by 3.28 beats per minute (bpm), 
whereas exenatide increased heart rate by 0.69 bpm [76]. It is

unknown whether the divergent effects on heart rate achieved 
by different GLP-1 analogs may contribute to cardiovascular 
outcomes.
Finally, some differences were observed in the safety and 
side effect profiles of the different classes of GLP-1 analogs. 
Nausea and vomiting were less common with longer-acting 
GLP-1 analogs than with short-acting GLP-1 analogs, proba￾bly because of the more gradual increase in plasma drug levels 
achieved with longer-acting GLP-1 analogs [17,59,67,74]. An￾tibody formation was much more common with exenatide or 
exenatide LAR than with liraglutide [17,52], presumably be￾cause of their lesser degree of amino acid homology with na￾tive human GLP-1. The frequency of antiexenatide antibodies 
and injection site problems were more common with exenatide 
LAR than with exenatide [17]. Severe hypoglycemia was rare 
across all studies, but mild hypoglycemia was not uncommon 
and mostly associated with the use of sulfonylureas [17,19,76]. 
The results of clinical studies with lixisenatide (short-acting 
but for once-daily injection), albiglutide (prolonged-acting for 
once weekly injection), and dulaglutide (prolonged-acting for 
once weekly injection) will be available in the near future, and 
will help further clarify the similarities and the differences in 
the efficacy and safety of the three classes of GLP-1 analogs.
CONCLUSIONS 
GLP-1 based therapy has changed the treatment of diabetes to 
a considerable degree over the last decade. GLP-1 analogs de￾crease both fasting and postprandial blood glucose levels 
without causing hypoglycemia and while enabling modest 
weight loss, a significant achievement for many patients with 
type 2 diabetes. Beyond glycemic control, GLP-1 based com￾pounds may also reduce cardiovascular risk factors and pro￾mote kidney function, liver function, and energy metabolism 
[78]. However, GLP-1 analogs do present some drawbacks. 
Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea are frequently reported in 
some patients, and there remains some debate over the rela￾tionship of GLP-1 analog treatment to risk of pancreatitis, 
pancreas cancer, and thyroid cancer [53,54]. Since we are not 
able to exploit the full benefit of GLP-1 and its analogs with 
current drug delivery systems [79], further research will be es￾sential to fully elucidate the mechanism and/or site(s) of ac￾Breakfast Breakfast Plasma GLP-1 analog levels Plasma glucose levels
