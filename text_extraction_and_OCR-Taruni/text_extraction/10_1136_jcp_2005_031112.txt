Gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs) are the most
common primary mesenchymal tumours of the
gastrointestinal tract. Most of them show activating
mutations of the genes coding for KIT or platelet-derived
growth factor receptor a (PDGFRa), two receptor tyrosine
kinases (RTKs). The RTK inhibitor Imatinib (GleevecH,
Novartis, Switzerland), induces regression of the tumour.
The level of response to treatment, together with other
clinicopathological parameters is related to the type and
site of the activating mutation, thus suggesting that these
tumours should be classified according to the molecular
context. This is confirmed also by the phenomenon of the
resistance to treatment, which arises because of different
mechanisms (second mutation, amplification, activation of
other RTKs) and can be fought only by specific RTK
inhibitors, that are at present under development. RTK
activation involves an homogeneous transduction pathway
whose components (MAPK, AKT, PI3K, mTOR and RAS)
are possible targets of new molecular treatment. A new
paradigm of classification integrating the classic
pathological criteria with the molecular changes will permit
personalised prognosis and treatment.

Gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST),
although relatively rare, are the most
common primary mesenchymal tumours
of the gastrointestinal tract, with an incidence of
nearly 20/1 000 000/year.1–5 Their biological
behaviour is difficult to predict, ranging from
benign to malignant. The most reliable prognos￾tic factors are size and mitotic index. On the
basis of these factors (and to some extent on
anatomical location), two risk classifications are
proposed (tables 1 and 2).5 6
Stromal tumours of the gastrointestinal tract
were regarded as smooth-muscle tumours (leio￾myoma, leiomyoblastoma) until electron micros￾copy and immunohistochemistry analysis
showed that only a small fraction of these
tumours showed smooth-muscle differentiation.
Therefore, in 1983 Mazur and Clark9 proposed
the non-committal designation, stromal tumour,
which now encompasses tumours with schwan￾nian or neuronal differentiation (gastrointestinal
autonomic nerve tumours,10). We now know that
GISTs may have either a well-developed or an in￾complete myoid, neural, autonomic nerve or mixed
phenotype, or may remain undifferentiated.5 11 In
the late 1990s, it was shown that GISTs share
morphological, immunophenotypical and genetic
characteristics with the interstitial cells of Cajal
(ICCs), the pacemaker cells of the gut.2 12 13 They
have immunophenotypical and ultrastructural
features of both smooth muscle and neuronal
differentiation, and regulate peristalsis. Most
GISTs express the tyrosin kinase KIT oncopro￾tein2 14 that is also the immunohistochemical
marker of ICC. The expression of KIT is so strong
and specific that it was claimed to be required for
the diagnosis,3–5 15 16 whereas it is now clear that a
small, but significant fraction of GISTs (5–10%) are
indeed KIT negative.17–20
KIT is normally expressed in several cell types
other than ICC.21 22 In particular, KIT expression
has a crucial role in embryogenesis, encouraging
differentiation of primitive mesenchymal pro￾genitor cells towards ICC and is essential to the
formation of a functional ICC network.12 It
belongs to the type III receptor tyrosine kinase
(RTK) subfamily, whose members include
platelet-derived growth factor receptors a and b
(PDGFRa and PDGFRb). All RTKIII contain five
immunoglobulin-like domains in their extracellu￾lar ligand-binding region followed by a single
transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic tyr￾osine kinase domain interrupted by a large kinase
insert. The ligand of KIT is known as stem cell
factor .22 As in other RTK, stem cell factor induces
dimerisation of KIT followed by transautopho￾sphorylation of the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase
domain, leading to activation of multiple signal￾ling pathways, such as the PI3K/AKT and c-Jun
N-terminal kinase/STAT pathways23 (fig 1). The
constitutive activation of KIT is one of the earliest
transforming events in GISTs and occurs mainly
through activating mutations in the kit
gene,2 8 14 18 21 24–28 but there is evidence of alternate
activating mechanisms in a subset of tumours.
Activating mutations of kit gene in GIST occur in
exons 11, 9, 13 and 17 (fig 1), corresponding to the
juxtamembrane intracellular regulatory domain,
the extramembrane domain and the two intracy￾toplasmic tyrosine kinase domains, respec￾tively.18 29 30 In the first phase, the presence of
activating mutations seemed to be related to a
malignant behaviour.31 32 Subsequently, it was
shown that most GISTs, even the tumours
,1 cm in size that were found incidentally, do
harbour KIT mutations.24 33–35 The meaning of KIT
activation is highlighted by the recent introduction

of an inhibitor of RTKs, STI-571 (Imatinib, Gleevec, Novartis,
Switzerland), which can induce regression of GISTs. Even
advanced disease has been stabilised, with a return of quality of
life.36–42 The proper application of STI-571 is currently being
investigated to identify the patients most likely to benefit from
the treatment. So far, it is indicated for the treatment of
metastatic inoperable disease or for cytoreduction in cases not
amenable to macroscopically complete resection.43 Many trials
are in course which are, however, considering the possibility of
using the drug in an adjuvant or neoadjuvant setting.44
Another member of the RTK family, PDGFRa, is associated
with the pathogenesis of GIST and mutations in c-kit are
mutually exclusive with those in pdgfra.
45 Interestingly, these
two genes are located in the same chromosomal region
(4q12).46 47 The most frequent mutations in pdgfra are
observed in exons 18 (second tyrosine kinase domain), 12
(regulatory juxtamembrane domain) or 14 (tyrosine kinase
domain) (fig. 1). Both in vitro48 and in vivo49 studies have
shown that the type of mutation in c-kit or pgdfra genes may
predict the response to treatment with imatinib. It is now
well known that a mutation in exon 11 of kit is associated
with a better response to treatment with inhibitors of RTK,
with a decreasing response for mutation in exons 9, 13, 17
and wild-type tumours. Depending on the mutation, some
cells expressing the PDGFRa exon 18 mutant were sensitive
to imatinib, whereas others were resistant. Mutants in exons
14 and 12 are sensitive to the drug .14 49 50 Moreover, tumours
with mutations in the pdgfra gene are prevalently epithe￾lioid.51 Some specific RTK mutations are also correlated with
clinicopathological parameters, such as histological type,
overall survival, localisation and risk classification.48 49 52 53
Table 3 shows a brief summary of this correlation.
MUTATIONS OF THE KIT GENE
Exon 11 (juxtamembrane domain)
The juxtamembrane region of KIT inhibits receptor dimerisa￾tion in the absence of stem cell factor. Small in-frame
deletions and insertions or point mutations on this domain
affect this function.54 55 The reported frequency of mutations
in exon 11 varies from 20% to 92%, depending on the type of
material (frozen or formalin fixed) and the technique
used.8 14 18 31–33 51 56 57 Most of the mutations are located
between codons 556 and 560, with deletions and insertions
prevalently affecting codons 557–559 and point mutations
affecting codons 559 and 560.8 24 49 51–53 58–60 Internal tandem
duplications are prevalently found towards the end of the
exon (codons 576–580).52 The type of mutation is apparently
related to the prognosis, with deletions behaving more
aggressively in comparison with insertions and point muta￾tions,8 18 29 58 61–63 and to the risk classification.
Exon 9 (extracellular domain)
The frequency of this mutation is described in 5–18% of cases,
depending on the series.18 24 28 49 53 64–72 It occurs mainly at
codons 501–502 and is represented by duplication–insertion.
It is associated with small intestinal localization and
aggressive behaviour.18 24 Its mechanism probably affects an
antidimerisation motif in the extracellular domain.
Exon 13 (kinase I domain)
This rare mutation, affecting codon 642, occurs in 0.8–4.1% of
cases.1 3 35 49 64–66 70 71 73 74 It is associated with resistance to
treatment with imatinib.
Exon 17 (activation loop)
The activating mechanism of these rare mutations (0.6% of
cases)18 33 affecting codons 820 and 822, is unclear. A
mutation occuring at codon 817, highly activating and
frequently observed in other tumours (mastocytosis, acute
myelogenous leukaemia), was never observed in GISTs,
implying that the transforming mechanisms in the genesis
of GIST are different from those of other tumours.18 23
MUTATION IN THE PDGFRA GENE
They are observed in 7–12% of cases,18 20 29 45 49 50 51 occurring
more often in exon 18 (activation loop) and rarely in exons
12 (juxtamembrane domain) and 14 (kinase I domain).
pdgfra Mutants are prevalently epithelioid, located in the
stomach and show weak or no immunohistochemical
reactivity for KIT,18 20 29 45 49–51 75 76 but are functionally similar
to kit mutants. The mutations occur in homologous domains,
and activation of the downstream signalling pathways seem
to be largely similar in the two mutant subtypes.77 Some
degree of difference in gene expression may exist, but these
data need confirmation in larger series.78
Exon 18 (activation loop)
Mutations occur at codons 842–849. Some of them (D842V,
RD841–842KI and DI842–843IM) have shown considerable
resistance to treatment with imatinib.45 48 49 79
Exon 12 (juxtamembrane domain)
Mutations occur at codons 561–571 and are associated with
good response to imatinib.18 48–50

Exon 14 (kinase I domain)
A single rare mutation is described (N659K). It showed in
vitro sensitivity to imatinib that is comparable to that
observed in kit exon 13 mutants.20 50
GISTS IN THE PAEDIATRIC AGE GROUP
Most GISTs (95%) arise in adults over 40 years of age.80 81
Some GISTs in children (6–14 years) and young adults (15–24
years) occur in connection with Carney’s triad or neurofibro￾matosis type 1.82–84 Rare cases of familial GISTs are described,
which carry a kit or pdgfra germline mutation.57 85–93
Sporadic paediatric GISTs
Two series of paediatric GISTs 6 72 showed that these tumours
occur without mutations in both kit and pdgfra. They show
mainly an indolent course, with treatable recurrence. A
specific gene expression signature was found in five cases,
including overexpression of phosphate kinase alpha 1
(PHKA1), previously reported in a subset of acute myelo￾genous leukaemia in elderly women.72
Paediatric GISTs associated with syndromes
GISTs associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 do not have
mutations in the kit or pdgfra gene, except in rare cases, not
corresponding to the hot spots of sporadic GISTs.82 94–96 They
show an indolent course, preferential location in the small
bowel and the colon and a tendency for multiple
tumours.82 94–96
Carney’s triad97 is an association of GIST, paraganglioma
and pulmonary chordoma. The genetic basis is unknown. In

all, 85% of patients are women. The diagnosis is generally
made at a young age or in infancy. GISTs associated with
Carney’s triad do not harbour mutations in the kit or pdgfra
genes.18 98
Familial GISTs are rare.57 85–93 Most affected families carry a
kit germline mutation, inherited as autosomal dominant. One
family showed a mutation is the pdgfra gene. Tumours are
usually multiple and multifocal and arise at earlier ages than
sporadic GISTs. They are associated with urticaria pigmen￾tosa, melanocytic nevi, melanomas, achalasia or neuronal
hyperplasia of the myenteric plexus.57 85–93 Genetic mechan￾isms of progression are similar in familial and sporadic GISTs
in adults.93
Cytogenetic changes in GISTs
The cytogenetic changes in GISTs were extensively studied by
using different techniques (table 4).99–108
A correlation between the number and type of chromoso￾mal changes and biological behaviour of GISTs was
suggested.21 Karyotypes from about 60% of GISTs show a
partial or total loss of chromosome 14.21 45 104 109 In particular,
14q11.1–12 and 14q22–24 are frequently deleted and can
therefore represent sites for tumour suppressor genes
participating early in the genesis of GISTs.104 110 Loss of 22q
is observed in about half of GISTs, with a higher frequency in
advanced tumours.77 111 It is possible therefore that an
unknown gene on 22q may be responsible in the early stages
of tumorigenesis and in tumour progression.18 45 111
Intermediate-risk and high-risk GISTs show loss of chromo￾somes 1p, 9p, 9q, 11p100 102 104 106 108 111 and gains of 8q and
17q.100 102 105 108 A sort of molecular pathway in the acquisition
of genetic aberrations may parallel the progressive acquisition
of malignancy.18 The precise role of single changes and their
prognostic impact was not elucidated. Probably, cytogenetic
changes in GISTs, above all in those with intermediate- and
high-risk, are more complex.35 53 61 77 112 113 For instance, 8q
gains were described in as many as 57% of metastatic
GISTs.100 Gains of c-myc, a well-known oncogene located on
8q24.12–13, in only 3 of 100 GISTs,61 implies that the target of
this amplification are other, still unknown, oncogenes.
Cell cycle network and GIST
One possible target on chromosome 9p is the cyclin￾dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (cdkn2a) gene, located on
9p21, with its two transcripts, p16INK4a and p14ARF, which
results from an alternative reading frame on the first exon.114
cdkn2a has a central role in the control of cell cycle and
apoptosis. p14ARF inhibits mouse double minute 2 (MDM2)
from degrading p53.115 p16INK4A binds to the cyclin￾dependent kinase 4 and blocks the phosphorylation of RB1
protein, with consequent binding of the RBI to E2F1, which
may influence the expression of thousand genes responsible
for the control of proliferation, transcription and apopto￾sis.116–118 Inactivation of p16INK4 may occur through muta￾tion or promoter hypermethylation.116 117 Molecular genetics
and immunohistochemistry showed 113 119 120 that a loss of p16
may have an independent value in identifying a subset of
tumours with adverse prognosis. These results are supported
by the observation that dysregulation of other members of
the CDKN2a network may be linked to adverse prognosis.116
We61 analysed a series of 100 GISTs by fluorescent in situ
hybridisation (FISH) and found amplifications of CyclinD1
(ccnd1) and mdm2 genes in a subset of high-risk tumours.
Mouse double minute 2 interacts with Raf/methyl-ethyl
ketone /mitogen activated protein kinase121 and phosphati￾dylinositol-3-kinase/AKT/c-Jun N-terminal kinase122 123 path￾ways, both of which are triggered by KIT-activation.18 21 124
We also found three cases of coamplifications of ccnd1 and
mdm2.
61 125 An immunohistochemical study attempted to
relate the cell cycle machinery and prognosis in 80 GISTs.126
Cyclin A, cyclin B1, cdc2 and Ki-67 were associated with a
high risk of malignant behaviour and short disease-free
survival.
EXPRESSION STUDIES
The first study of gene expression in GISTs34 showed that the
presence of kit mutations (at that time, the presence of pdgfra
mutations was not known) could identify a homogeneous
expression profile, distinguishing GISTs from other mesench￾ymal tumours. In particular, genes that probably participated
in the pacemaker function of the ICC (ion channels,
receptors, transduction molecules) had a highly discriminant
value. One of these protein kinase Ch (prkch) is constitutively
activated in GISTs and could therefore be a therapeutic target

such as KIT.127 Another marker that has been identified by
gene expression analysis is DOG-1, and it has been proposed
also as a possible diagnostic marker.128 Subsequently gene
expression in GISTs may differ according to the presence of
mutation in kit or pdgfra,
77 to the type of mutations in kit or
pdgfra78 129 or to the anatomical location of the tumour.129
Differentially expressed genes included ezrin, p70S6k, map2k1,
akt, stat3, all of which were in the activating pathways
downstream of kit or pdgfra. Koon et al130 described by real￾time RT-PCR an association between the expression of cell
cycle proteins (cyclinB1, centromere protein-F kinetochore
protein) and tyrosine kinases with the biological behaviour in
a small series of GISTs.
SIGNALLING PATHWAYS
KIT and PDGFRa in GISTs show a homogeneous transduc￾tion pathway consisting of mitogen-activate protein kinase,
AKT, p70, STAT1, STAT3, PI3K, mammalian target of
rapamydin and RAS.18 21 45 In particular, oncogenic signalling
in these tumours differs from haematological diseases, and
selective inhibition of the PI3K/mammalian target of
rapamydin pathways reduces proliferation and inhibits
apoptosis.25 26 The degree of activation differs from tumour
to tumour, thus suggesting that factors different from KIT
may regulate signalling in these neoplasias.26 The develop￾ment of new targeted molecular treatments is aimed at
selectively blocking these pathways.
MOLECULAR CHANGES AND RESISTANCE TO
IMATINIB
Many patients with advanced GISTs develop resistance after
variable degrees of initial response to treatment.131 Two kinds
of resistance should be distinguished:44 (a) primary resis￾tance: evidence of progression within the first 6 months of
imatinib treatment, frequently associated with a wild-type
KIT protein, mutation in exon 9 of kit or a D842V mutation in
pdgfra; (b) secondary resistance: progression of disease after
6 months of treatment. The mechanisms of secondary
resistance are heterogeneous: (a) acquisition of a secondary
mutation in the kit or pdgfra genes;69 132–135 (b) genomic
amplification of kit and overexpression of the protein;133 and
(c) activation of other RTKs.18 A new generation of tyrosine
kinase inhibitors are presently under evaluation to solve this
problem.132 136
CONCLUSIONS
GISTs probably do not constitute a single group of tumours;
their biological behaviour (the prognosis and above all the
response to treatment) depends both on classic clinicopatho￾logical parameters (ie, location, size, mitotic activity) and on
the molecular changes that are detected in a given tumour
(type of mutation in RTK, chromosomal alterations, expres￾sion of cell cycle proteins, activation and control of pathways
downstream of the RTK, amplification or loss of genes, etc).
Moreover, a relationship was found between some patholo￾gical characteristics and molecular alterations (for instance,
tumours of the small intestine are associated with epithelioid
morphology and mutation in exon 9 of kit). This underlines
the need for a new paradigm of classification that can
combine the old pathological criteria with the molecular
changes.18 In the era of targeted treatments (imatinib is one
of the most successful examples), we are forced to change our
point of view from the microscopic to the molecular level and
to integrate all the data in a coherent schema.
