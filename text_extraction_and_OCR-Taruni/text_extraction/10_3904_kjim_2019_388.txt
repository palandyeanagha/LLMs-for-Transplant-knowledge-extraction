Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) is defined by specific clinical characteristics, 
including microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and patholog￾ic evidence of endothelial cell damage, as well as the resulting ischemic end-organ 
injuries. A variety of clinical scenarios have features of TMA, including infection, 
pregnancy, malignancy, autoimmune disease, and medications. These overlap￾ping manifestations hamper differential diagnosis of the underlying pathogen￾esis, despite recent advances in understanding the mechanisms of several types 
of TMA syndrome. Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) is caused by a 
genetic or acquired defect in regulation of the alternative complement pathway. It 
is important to consider the possibility of aHUS in all patients who exhibit TMA 
with triggering conditions because of the incomplete genetic penetrance of aHUS. 
Therapeutic strategies for aHUS are based on functional restoration of the com￾plement system. Eculizumab, a monoclonal antibody against the terminal com￾plement component 5 inhibitor, yields good outcomes that include prevention of 
organ damage and premature death. However, there remain unresolved challeng￾es in terms of treatment duration, cost, and infectious complications. A consensus 
regarding diagnosis and management of TMA syndrome would enhance under￾standing of the disease and enable treatment decision-making.

INTRODUCTION
Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) describes the 
histologic abnormalities in the endothelium found in 
a number of conditions. In 1924, Moschowitz report￾ed that thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) 
could be distinguished by hyaline thrombi in multi￾ple organs, including the kidneys. In 1952, Symmers

recognized pathognomonic disseminated lesions that 
occurred only in microscopic vessels and described 
the condition as TMA [1]. Subsequently, Gasser et al. [2] 
described hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) in 1955. 
However, the pathogeneses of TTP, HUS, and TMA 
remained unclear until the 1980s. The pathogenesis of 
TTP—i.e., atypically large von Willebrand factor mul￾timers—was discovered only in 1982 [3]. In 1985, Shiga 
toxin produced by Escherichia coli was found to cause 
HUS [4]. The pathogenesis of TMA was recently estab￾lished as endothelial cell injury associated with alter￾ations in factors that affect angiogenesis, coagulation, 
platelet activation, and complement function [1].
TMA syndromes are defined by specific clinical 
characteristics, including microangiopathic hemolytic 
anemia (MAHA), thrombocytopenia, and pathologic ev￾idence of endothelial cell damage; these manifestations 
lead to ischemic end-organ injuries [1]. Shiga toxin-as￾sociated HUS (i.e., typical HUS) is a TMA syndrome 
caused by infection with Shiga toxin-producing E. coli
(STEC) or Shigella. In contrast, atypical HUS (aHUS) is 
caused by a genetic or acquired defect in regulation of 
the alternative complement pathway [5]. Manifestations 
of atypical HUS can range from mild hematologic 
abnormalities to severe (sometimes life-threatening) 
end-organ damage such as gastrointestinal bleeding, 
seizure, blindness, or acute kidney injury requiring di￾alysis. Secondary TMA syndromes may be characterized 
by clinical manifestations similar to those of aHUS; 
however, these TMA syndromes typically have specific 
causes.
Differentiating among TMA syndromes is difficult 
but crucial because of the need for distinct therapeutic 
approaches. Previously, distinguishing between TTP 
and HUS was problematic; however, this was resolved 
by measurement of the serum levels or activities of 
von Willebrand factor-cleaving protein, a metallopro￾teinase with thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13 
(ADAMTS13). Currently, distinguishing between aHUS 
and secondary TMA syndromes remains challeng￾ing. The two conditions have similar manifestations 
but different treatment strategies. Secondary TMA 
syndromes can be managed by removal of triggering 
factors, whereas aHUS requires correction of comple￾ment dysregulation and removal of triggering factors. 
Moreover, eculizumab—a recombinant, humanized, 
monoclonal immunoglobulin that targets complement 
component 5 (C5) and hinders the cleavage of C5 to C5a 
and C5b—was approved for the treatment of aHUS, 
but not secondary TMA syndromes, as an alternative to 
plasmapheresis [6-8].
This is a consensus report of South Korean experts, 
including hematologists, adult and pediatric nephrol￾ogists, transplantation surgeons, pathologists, and 
genetic laboratory medicine specialists. This expert 
group gathered for several meetings from March 2019 
to November 2019 to share and harmonize opinions 
regarding diagnosis and management of TMA syn￾dromes. During these meetings, we generated updated 
consensus TMA diagnostic criteria and triggering fac￾tors based on the 2016 South Korean clinical practice 
guidelines for aHUS [9]. Here, we suggest a definition 
and differential diagnosis for TMA syndromes based 
on clinical manifestations and genetic factors. We also 
summarize therapeutic strategies for aHUS in both 
adult and pediatric patients.
TMA DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA
Hematologic abnormalities
TMA is defined on the basis of clinical, laboratory, and 
pathological features. The laboratory features include 
MAHA characterized by fragmented erythrocytes (e.g., 
schistocytes or helmet cells), thrombocytopenia (with 
increased numbers of bone marrow megakaryocytes), 
an elevated serum level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), 
and abnormal laboratory results related to TMA-medi￾ated organ damage (e.g., increased creatinine level and 
hematuria or proteinuria). The pathological features 
are systemic microvascular thrombosis and endothelial 
injury (Fig. 1) [1,10].
According to the definition of TMA suggested by the 
Korean aHUS Working Group, evidence of MAHA (he￾moglobin level < 10 g/dL, increased serum LDH level, 
decreased serum haptoglobin level, and presence of 
red blood cell fragments in a peripheral blood smear) 
and thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 150,000/μL) 
are required for the diagnosis of TMA [9]. The Joint 
Committee of the Japanese Society of Nephrology and 
the Japan Pediatric Society suggested similar criteria 
for the diagnosis of TMA: MAHA (confirmed based on 

27
Lee H, et al. Current diagnosis and management of aHUS 
https://doi.org/10.3904/kjim.2019.388 www.kjim.org
an increased serum LDH level, a marked reduction in 
serum haptoglobin level, and the presence of red blood 
cell fragments) with a hemoglobin level of < 10 g/dL 
and thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 150,000/μL) 
[11,12]. However, a haptoglobin level below the lower 
limit of normal (LLN) or the presence of schistocytes 
may not be observed, despite the presence of active 
TMA. In addition, the platelet count may be within the 
normal range in up to 20% of patients with aHUS [13] 
and a hemoglobin level above the LLN may be observed 
in patients with TMA [13,14]. From these, we suggest the 
previous Korean definition for TMA is changed. The 
laboratory criteria for TMA applied in previous clinical 
trials for aHUS were: (1) evidence of hemolysis such as 
an LDH level above the upper limit of normal, a hapto￾globin level below the LLN, or the presence of schisto￾cytes on a peripheral blood smear; and (2) low platelet 
count (< 150,000/μL) or a 25% reduction in the average 
of three platelet counts before the most recent TMA 
complication [15].
Therefore, the laboratory criteria for TMA should in￾clude two categories such as evidence of MAHA with a 
serum hemoglobin level below the LLN and thrombo￾cytopenia (below the LLN or a reduction of > 25% from 
the patient’s usual baseline). The evidence of MAHA in￾cludes an increased serum LDH level and the presence 
of red blood cell fragments. However, the schistocyte 
criterion for MAHA may be ignored in patients with 
definite clinical or pathologic evidence of TMA.
Kidney manifestations
Any organ that contains endothelial cells can be affect￾ed by TMA. Glomerular endothelial cells are one of the 
main targets of TMA for a reason that remains unclear. 
The fenestrated glomerular endothelium may lack 
complement regulators, increasing its susceptibility to 
complement activation [16]. Alternatively, podocyte in￾jury may lead to endothelial injury, because the health

of glomerular endothelial cells is dependent on podo￾cyte-derived vascular endothelial growth factor [17].
Pathologic findings that reflect tissue responses to 
endothelial injury in the kidney are classified as fol￾lows, according to activity, microvascular area involved, 
and mechanism: active versus chronic, glomeruli ver￾sus arterioles versus arteries, and thrombotic versus 
non-thrombotic lesions. These criteria were developed 
during the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes 
Controversies Conference for aHUS and complement 
component 3 (C3) glomerulopathy [18]. Active lesions 
include intravascular fibrin thrombi with mucoid 
changes, as well as endothelial swelling. In addition, 
swollen glomerular endothelial cells with loss of fen￾estration, expansion of lamina rara interna, and fibrin 
tactoid with platelets and fragmented red blood cells 
can be found on electron microscopic examination [19]. 
Chronic lesions contain double contours of capillary 
walls, mesangial interposition in glomeruli, hyaline 
deposits in arterioles, and fibrous intimal thickening 
with concentric lamination (onion skin appearance) in 
arteries. Thrombotic lesions feature intraluminal fibrin 
or fibrin-platelet plugging. Although it is difficult to 
identify the etiology of TMA based on kidney pathology 
findings, recognition of the TMA pattern of kidney in￾jury is crucial to provide firm evidence of TMA and to 
identify a potential underlying mechanism.
The above pathologic injuries typically manifest as 
acute kidney injury or urinary abnormalities. Acute 
kidney injury is defined as a rapid decline in kidney 
function characterized by a serum creatinine elevation 
by ≥ 0.3 mg/dL within 48 hours or ≥ 1.5-fold the baseline 
value, which is known or presumed to have occurred 
within the prior 7 days [20]. In urinalysis, albuminuria 
is identified in more than half of patients with TMA [21]. 
It is unknown whether the amount of proteinuria or 
microalbuminuria correlates with the severity of TMA 
syndrome or not.
Involvement of other organs
Gastrointestinal tract involvement is frequently found 
in TMA. Diarrhea, which may be bloody, is the most 
common feature of gastrointestinal involvement. 
Furthermore, the central nervous system is able to be 
affected in TMA; this is characterized by confusion, sei￾zure, stroke, or encephalopathy. These manifestations 
were previously regarded as unique characteristics of 
TTP. Respiratory tract involvement is a common pre￾sentation of TMA syndrome; this includes upper re￾spiratory tract infection, pulmonary hypertension, and 
pulmonary hemorrhage. The cardiovascular system has 
abundant endothelial cells. Therefore, hypertension 
including malignant hypertension frequently occurs in 
TMA patients. In addition, large vessels (e.g., carotid, 
cerebral, coronary, and pulmonary) and myocardial ves￾sels themselves may be damaged by TMA syndromes. 
Skin damage has been reported as purpuric or necrot￾ic changes and ocular involvement, including severe 
retinal detachment due to retinal artery occlusion, 
although, such damage is rare. These extrarenal TMA 
manifestations are rarely demonstrated pathologically 
because of the difficulty in involved tissue acquisition. 
Therefore, understanding the kidney pathology and 
associated molecular mechanisms may enable differen￾tiation among TMA syndromes with various causes.
Diagnosis of pediatric aHUS
When a child presents with HUS, the first condition to 
consider is diarrhea-associated HUS. Diarrhea-asso￾ciated HUS is typically a result of enterohemorrhagic 
STEC, and the patient often exhibits prodromal symp￾toms of diarrhea, abdominal pain, and hematochezia. 
STEC-HUS is diagnosed when STEC is cultured from 
stool or Shiga toxin is identified by polymerase chain 
reaction. HUS in a previously healthy child, particularly 
an infant, without specific prodromal symptoms of gas￾trointestinal infection is presumably aHUS.
While diagnostic criteria for TMA and HUS in chil￾dren are identical those in adults, the conditions to ex￾clude before diagnosis of aHUS are relatively different. 
In adults, TTP is one of the first differential conditions 
after secondary TMA syndromes; therefore, ADAMTS13 
activity should be measured first, along with investi￾gations of medications and conditions that can induce 
TMA such as malignancy and autoimmune diseases. 
Secondary TMA syndromes should also be considered 
in children; however, the majority of pediatric patients 
present without a medical history suggestive of second￾ary TMA syndromes, and TTP is uncommon. There￾fore, previously healthy children with HUS who exhibit 
no evidence of gastrointestinal infection should be 
assumed to have aHUS. After assessment of ADAMTS13

activity and measurement of complement factors and 
their antibodies, treatment targeting aHUS should be 
administered rapidly.
In addition, aHUS typically occurs in the presence 
of a trigger that activates the complement system. 
Notably, infection or another factor that causes activa￾tion of the immune system can trigger aHUS. A con￾siderable number of patients with aHUS, particularly 
those with anti-complement factor H (CFH) antibodies, 
have gastrointestinal symptoms. Therefore, the pres￾ence of gastrointestinal symptoms cannot be used to 
rule out aHUS. If the course is atypical for diarrhea-as￾sociated HUS and gastrointestinal symptoms are mild 
while HUS is severe, aHUS should be suspected.
Key message
• Evidence of MAHA (increased serum LDH level 
and presence of red blood cell fragments) with 
a serum hemoglobin level below the LLN and 
thrombocytopenia (below the LLN or a reduc￾tion of > 25% from the patient’s usual baseline) 
should be included for the diagnosis of TMA. 
However, the schistocyte criterion for MAHA 
may be ignored in patients with definite clini￾cal or pathologic evidence of TMA.
• Atypical HUS can range from mild hema￾tologic abnormalities to severe (sometimes 
life-threatening) end-organ damage such as 
gastrointestinal bleeding, seizure, blindness, or 
acute kidney injury requiring dialysis.
• In patients with TMA and any organ injury, 
assays for STEC and ADAMTS13 activity should 
be performed for differential diagnosis. aHUS 
should be suspected in all STEC-negative pa￾tients with normal ADAMTS13 activity (≥ 10%).
• Pediatric patients who exhibit TMA without 
gastrointestinal infection should be assumed 
to have aHUS and should be treated rapidly be￾cause TTP is uncommon in children.
TRIGGERS OF TMA
Because of the incomplete genetic penetrance of aHUS, 
a second hit, which may be genetic or acquired, is re￾quired for its development. A variety of medications 
and clinical conditions such as infection, pregnancy, 
malignancy, and autoimmune disease can be associat￾ed with TMA syndromes. These triggering conditions 
are considered causes of secondary TMA syndromes. 
However, recent evidence suggests that they cannot be 
separated from aHUS. Rather, they may coexist with 
aHUS, and may contribute to triggering activation of 
the complement system in patients genetically predis￾posed to aHUS [22]. For that reason, they are regarded 
as co-existing diseases or as complement-amplifying 
conditions. TMA-associated conditions, co-existing 
diseases, and complement-amplifying conditions are 
described as triggering factors in this article. If TMA 
persists despite remission or successful treatment of 
triggering factors, then the diagnosis of aHUS should 
be strongly considered [22]. According to the report by 
Noris et al. [23] regarding the clinical characteristics of 
273 patients with aHUS, 70% had at least one triggering 
factor; this was most commonly diarrhea/gastroenteri￾tis (16.5%), followed by upper respiratory tract infection 
(12.8%).
Pregnancy
Most cases of pregnancy-associated TMA develop 
during the postpartum period [24]. In one study, the re￾nal outcomes were very poor, such that 76% of the pa￾tients progressed to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) de￾spite plasmapheresis treatment. Recently, complement 
mutations were identified in more than 50% of patients 
with pregnancy-associated TMA. Therefore, pregnancy 
can be regarded as a triggering factor for TMA syn￾dromes in women with underlying genetic abnormali￾ties associated with complement system regulation [24]. 
Furthermore, these findings suggest that eculizumab 
may be an effective therapy for pregnancy-associated 
TMA syndromes in women with dysregulated comple￾ment activation [25].
Malignant hypertension
Although the endothelial damage caused by TMA syn￾drome can induce elevation of blood pressure, severe 
hypertension may lead to further endothelial damage 
and changes in the renal vasculature, including fibri￾noid necrosis of arterioles and glomerular capillary 

30 www.kjim.org https://doi.org/10.3904/kjim.2019.388
The Korean Journal of Internal Medicine Vol. 35, No. 1, January 2020
tufts [26]. Therefore, patients with hypertension-asso￾ciated TMA should undergo aggressive blood pressure 
control and receive supportive treatment to resolve 
acute features of TMA and prevent further kidney in￾jury [27]. In a recent retrospective case series, genetic 
predisposition to preferentially use the alternative com￾plement pathway was identified in patients for whom 
TMA was initially triggered by severe hypertension; 
among nine patients, eight demonstrated progression 
to ESRD despite controlled blood pressure [26]. This 
suggests that dysregulation of the alternative comple￾ment pathway is the cause of renal impairment in pa￾tients with malignant hypertension.
Kidney transplantation
The incidence of post-transplant TMA is reportedly 5.6 
cases per 1,000 kidney transplant (KT) recipients [28]. 
Post-transplant TMA can occur at any time, but most 
commonly manifests at 3 to 6 months after KT [29,30]. 
The incidence of post-transplant TMA was 36.5-fold 
greater than that of TMA in patients with native kidney 
[28]. The risk factors for TMA in KT recipients are more 
complex than those in patients with other conditions 
(Fig. 2) [31-34].
Genetic mutations are also important risk factors for 
the recurrence of aHUS during the post-transplant pe￾riod. Approximately 50% of KT recipients with genetic 
mutations developed ESRD at 3 years after KT, due to 
recurrent TMA [35]. Therefore, living related donor KT 
is not recommended due to the possibility of hidden 
genetic mutations.
The majority of patients with recurrent TMA may ex￾hibit recurrence of aHUS [31]. Recurrent TMA has more 
sudden onset, more severe clinical features, a higher 
rate of systemic involvement, and worse graft outcomes 
than de novo TMA [36]. In KT recipients, recurrent TMA 
with possible recurrence of aHUS should be suspected 
in the presence of the following: (1) hypertensive ne￾phrosclerosis in kidney biopsy before KT or ESRD of 
unknown etiology; (2) young age; (3) occurrence soon af￾ter KT; (4) unexplained severe and rapid progression of 
clinical features after KT; and (5) clinical manifestations 
without evidence on kidney biopsy [32,36,37]. However, 
some patients with post-transplant TMA do not show 
systemic signs; for such patients, allograft biopsy is 
needed to confirm the diagnosis [37].
Other solid organ and bone marrow transplantation
TMA can also develop after transplantation of other 
solid organs, including the liver, pancreas, lung, and 
heart [38,39]. The underlying mechanism has not been 
elucidated; it is likely to be multifactorial, involving cal￾cineurin inhibitors, viral infections, and antibody-me￾diated rejection. Allogeneic bone marrow transplants 
can also cause secondary TMA syndromes. Similarly, 
the causes of TMA after bone marrow transplant are 
likely to be multifactorial; these may include graft ver￾sus host disease, human leukocyte antigen mismatch, 
chemotherapy, radiation therapy, infection, and the use 
of calcineurin inhibitors [40-42]. Meticulous supportive 
care and removal of the precipitating factors are the 
best treatment options for TMA in such patients.
Drugs
Development of TMA has been reported in relation 
to various drugs, including quinine, cyclosporine, tac￾rolimus, sirolimus, bevacizumab, gemcitabine, inter￾feron, mitomycin C, oxaliplatin, and sunitinib [43-49]. 
Drug-induced TMA develops by two main mechanisms: 
immune-mediated and direct toxicity-mediated. In im￾Clinical signs suspicious of post-transplant TMA

mune-mediated drug-induced TMA, the drug induces 
antibodies that react with platelets and endothelial cells 
in a distinctive manner. The most common cause of 
immune-mediated drug-induced TMA is quinine [50]. 
Toxicity-mediated TMA may have multiple mecha￾nisms, and is often dose-dependent. Common causes 
of toxicity-mediated drug-induced TMA include type 
1 interferon [51], calcineurin inhibitors, and a variety of 
anticancer drugs [52] including bevacizumab, sunitinib, 
and gemcitabine. Thus far, there are no definite guide￾lines for the treatment of drug-induced TMA; support￾ive care and discontinuation of the offending drug are 
the primary treatment approaches used [25]. A better 
understanding of the mechanisms of drug-induced 
TMA is needed to enhance diagnosis and treatment 
and prevent re-exposure to the offending drug.
Autoimmune disorders and vasculitides
Systemic lupus erythematosus-associated TMA is relat￾ed to disease activity. Immune complex formation and 
sequential terminal complement activation constitute 
an important pathogenetic mechanism of organ in￾volvement, including the kidney. Concomitant TMA in 
patients with lupus nephritis is associated with higher 
susceptibility to infection, worse kidney outcomes, 
and a lower survival rate [22]. In one study, use of ecu￾lizumab resulted in improvement of symptoms, renal 
function, and cytopenia in patients who were refractory 
to conventional treatment for systemic lupus erythema￾tosus [53]. Advanced scleroderma can also be associated 
with aHUS, particularly in cases of scleroderma renal 
crisis. There is also an anecdotal report that eculizum￾ab treatment led to resolution of TMA in a patient with 
scleroderma renal crisis [54].
Associations of TMA and systemic autoimmune 
vasculitis—such as eosinophilic granulomatosis with 
polyangiitis (Churg-Strauss syndrome), granulomato￾sis with polyangiitis (Wegener granulomatosis), and 
Henoch-Schoenlein purpura—have been reported [55]. 
Some TMA syndromes associated with autoimmune 
conditions are essentially aHUS triggered by autoim￾munity, and therefore benefit from complement inhi￾bition [56].
Fibrinous thrombotic diseases
Disseminated intravascular coagulation, paroxysmal 
nocturnal hemoglobinuria, and catastrophic antiphos￾pholipid syndrome are differential diagnoses of aHUS. 
However, in some instances, those fibrinous throm￾botic conditions can trigger aHUS due to crosstalk 
between the complement and coagulation systems: the 
complement cascade is activated during activation of 
coagulation cascades [57]. Disseminated intravascular 
coagulation-associated TMAs, often observed in bone 
marrow infiltration by solid tumors or in liver failure, 
differ from aHUS. However, there may be some overlap 
[58] based on crosstalk between the two systems.
Infection and sepsis
TMA can be triggered by viral infections, including in￾fluenza virus, human immunodeficiency virus, adeno￾virus, and cytomegalovirus (often in the post-transplant 
setting) [59]. In addition to toxin-mediated TMA due 
to STEC, systemic bacterial infection can trigger com￾plement-mediated TMA. In patients with Streptococcus 
pneumoniae infection, bacterial neuraminidase removes 
neuraminic acid from red blood cells, platelets, and 
glomerular endothelial membranes, thereby exposing 
the Thomsen-Friedenreich antigen (T-antigen; CD176) 
to natural antibodies. The antigen-antibody complexes 
thus formed activate the classical complement pathway 
[14]. A similar mechanism is proposed for Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa-related TMA [60]. Favorable outcomes of ec￾ulizumab have been reported in TMA associated with 
the aforementioned infections, including cytomegalo￾virus [61].
Sepsis can trigger TMA because it is a strong com￾plement-activating condition [62]. In patients with 
sepsis, excessive production of C5a results in paralysis 
of innate immunity and contributes to failed infection 
responses [62]. A potential benefit of eculizumab for 
improving sepsis outcomes has been suggested in a

Key message
• A variety of medications and clinical condi￾tions (e.g., infection, pregnancy, malignancy, 
and autoimmune disease) are associated with 
TMA syndromes.
• TMA syndromes may coexist with aHUS and 
may contribute to complement system acti￾vation in patients genetically predisposed to 
aHUS.
GENETIC TESTING IN aHUS
Genetic variants leading to inappropriate activation of 
the alternative complement pathway by loss or gain of 
protein function cause predisposition to aHUS, with or 
without triggering factors [64]. Overall, genetic aHUS 
(i.e., aHUS with identifiable predisposing variants in 
disease-associated genes) constitutes approximately 
60% of all cases of aHUS [16,65,66]. The genes asso￾ciated with aHUS include CFH, CD46 or membrane 
cofactor protein (MCP), C3, complement factor I (CFI), 
complement factor B (CFB), thrombomodulin (THBD), 
plasminogen (PLG), and diacylglycerol kinase epsilon 
(DGKE). Genetic testing for aHUS by massively parallel 
sequencing has recently become available as a clinical 
test in South Korea, and is indicated for all patients 
suspected to have aHUS without evidence of STEC 
infection, severe ADAMTS13 deficiency, or hyperho￾mocysteinemia/methyl-malonic aciduria. Genetic 
information supports diagnosis, clarity regarding the 
underlying pathophysiology, and guides treatment 
decisions; moreover, it is predictive of prognosis [67]. 
However, the absence of variants of a given set of genes 
does not preclude the diagnosis of aHUS because of 
the possibility of (1) variants in genes other than classi￾cal aHUS genes and (2) variants that can be missed by 
high-throughput sequencing (e.g., large genomic rear￾rangements or intronic variants not covered by conven￾tional panel testing). Comprehensive analysis involving 
an extended set of genes can uncover other genes/vari￾ants associated with aHUS. In addition, most variants 
(except those in DGKE) that cause autosomal recessive 
aHUS in pediatric patients have incomplete penetrance. 
The disease can be triggered by environmental condi￾tions in genetically susceptible patients [23]. Therefore, 
the diagnosis of aHUS depends primarily on clinical 
findings along with laboratory tests for differential di￾agnosis, such as tests for STEC and ADAMTS13 activity. 
Lastly, interpretation of variants of uncertain signifi￾cance, as described in the American College of Medical 
Genetics and Genomics guidelines, should be done 
cautiously in aHUS, considering the possible contribu￾tions of variants that exist in the population and those 
predicted to be benign or tolerated by in silico analyses 
without laboratory evidence of functional consequences 
[68,69].
Copy number analysis by multiplex ligation-depen￾dent probe amplification is needed to detect homozy￾gous deletions involving complement factor H related 
protein 1 (CFHR1)/complement factor H related protein 
3 (CFHR3) genes, which are associated with auto-anti￾bodies to CFH, particularly in pediatric patients [70,71]. 
Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification can 
also detect CFH/CFHR1 or CFHR1/CFH hybrids gener￾ated by genomic rearrangement [72]. Lastly, targeted ge￾notyping is indicated for the family members of aHUS 
patients with genetic variants to assess the associations 
of variant(s) of interest with the disease, to guide treat￾ment decisions, and to determine their genetic profiles. 
Careful genetic counseling is warranted due to the 
incomplete penetrance of the disease, especially when 
multiple variants are present in the family. In summa￾ry, genetic analysis in the form of a multi-gene panel 
test is essential for all patients suspected to have aHUS, 
along with multiplex ligation-dependent probe ampli￾fication analysis and an anti-CFH autoantibody test, 
particularly in pediatric patients. The interpretation 
of genetic test results should be cautious and should 
consider the disease characteristics.
In South Korea, a multicenter cohort of 51 Korean 
children with aHUS was screened for genetic variants 
using targeted exome sequencing covering 46 comple￾ment-related genes, together with measurement of the 
anti-CFH autoantibody titer [73]. Disease-associated 
variants were detected in 11 patients (22%); the affected 
genes were CFH, CFI, CD46 (MCP), and DGKE. Twelve 
patients (24%) had a homozygous deletion in the CFHR1
gene. The prevalence of anti-CFH autoantibody was 
29%, higher than that in other regions, and 73% of pa-

tients with anti-CFH autoantibody had a homozygous 
deletion in the CFHR1 gene. Therefore, all Korean 
children with suspected aHUS should be tested for 
the presence of anti-CFH antibodies in blood samples 
collected before treatment.
A multicenter study involving 66 adult South Korean 
patients with aHUS demonstrated a variant detection 
rate of approximately 60% by exome sequencing and 
screening of 14 genes [74]. The distribution and fre￾quency of genetic variants and homozygous CFHR1
deletion revealed a markedly different genetic profile, 
compared with that of South Korean pediatric patients 
with aHUS, as well as that of patients of other ethnic￾ities. More diverse genes were affected than in adult 
South Korean patients than in pediatric South Korean 
patients, and homozygous deletion of CFHR1 was rare. 
The higher frequency of THBD variants was a remark￾able finding and was regarded as an ethnic difference.
Key message
• Genes associated with aHUS include CFH, 
CD46 or MCP, C3, CFI, CFB, THBD, PLG, and 
DGKE.
• Genetic information supports diagnosis, clar￾ity regarding the underlying pathophysiology, 
and guides treatment decisions; moreover, it is 
predictive of prognosis. However, the absence 
of variants of a given set of genes does not pre￾clude the diagnosis of aHUS.
THERAPEUTIC STRATEGIES FOR aHUS
Therapeutic strategies for aHUS have been based on 
resolution of dysregulation in the complement system. 
Previously, plasma therapy, including plasma infusion 
and exchange, was the first-line treatment option for 
patients with aHUS. However, the therapeutic efficien￾cy of plasma therapy varies according to the causative 
genetic abnormalities of the alternative complement 
pathway or other pathways. Liver transplantation has 
been considered an alternative treatment option, al￾though its utility is limited due to perioperative mor￾bidities and donor shortage. Eculizumab, a monoclonal 
antibody to terminal C5, was introduced for the man￾agement of this debilitating disease and has shown su￾perior outcomes; notably, it prevents organ damage and 
premature death more effectively than prior modalities. 
Eculizumab has contributed to control of aHUS and 
has facilitated clinical, functional, and molecular re￾search to accelerate related diagnosis and treatment. 
The long-acting C5 complement inhibitor, ravulizum￾ab, received early approval by the Food and Drug Ad￾ministration for the treatment of aHUS. This advance 
will improve the quality of life of aHUS patients.
Plasma therapy
Empiric plasma therapy in aHUS remains recommend￾ed, pending Shiga toxin, ADAMTS13, anti-CFH auto￾antibody, and genetic testing [14,36,75]. Plasma therapy 
can be administered as a plasma infusion or plasma 
exchange (PE). Functional complement-regulating 
proteins can be supplied by plasma infusion with fresh 
frozen plasma. The effect of plasma infusion is limit￾ed in a small number of patients with complete CFH 
deficiency [36]; in contrast, PE can replace absent or de￾fective complement regulators and can remove autoan￾tibodies or mutated circulating complement regulators 
[76]. Before a firm diagnosis is made, PE is regarded as 
the standard of care. When TTP, STEC HUS, and sec￾ondary TMA syndromes have been ruled out, a switch 
to eculizumab is recommended [18]. When eculizumab 
is unavailable, therapeutic PE remains an alternative 
treatment option.
The American Society for Apheresis adjusted the cate￾gory for therapeutic apheresis from II (second-line ther￾apy) to III (non-established role of apheresis) in patients 
with complement factor gene mutations [75,77]. For CFH 
autoantibody-related aHUS, the combination of PE and 
immunosuppression has been effective (category I; first￾line therapy). PE is not considered effective for patients 
with MCP mutations, as MCP is a non-circulating pro￾tein attached to the cell membrane (category III) [75].
Evaluation of the response to plasma therapy
If eculizumab is not applicable, a 1.5 plasma volume, 
equivalent to 60 to 75 mL/kg per session, should be ex￾changed for fresh frozen plasma. PE must be performed 
daily for 5 days, then five times weekly for 2 weeks, and 
subsequently three times weekly for 2 weeks [78]. Long￾term maintenance therapy can be weekly to every 2 to 4

weeks [79]. The absence of a PE response can be defined 
as either the absence of normalization of platelet count 
or the absence of reduction in plasma creatinine level 
≥ 25% in patients without severe chronic damage on 
biopsy or renal imaging after 5 consecutive days of PE 
[14,80]. However, the number of sessions and duration 
of PE for aHUS are controversial. Decisions concern￾ing duration or discontinuation should be made based 
upon the patient’s response and condition [75].
Interpretation of kidney dysfunction after hematologic nor￾malization
It is uncertain whether kidney dysfunction can be con￾sidered a marker of disease activity. In an observational 
study of complement abnormalities in 273 patients 
with aHUS, 53% to 67% of the patients developed ESRD 
during the first episode or within 3 years of onset, al￾though plasma therapy induced complete or partial 
remission of 63%, 25%, 57%, 88%, and 75% of episodes 
in patients with CFH, CFI, C3, or THBD mutations or 
anti-CFH autoantibodies, respectively [23]. The major￾ity of patients with CFH, CFI, C3, or THBD mutations 
or anti-CFH autoantibodies lost renal function or 
died during the presenting episode, or demonstrated 
progression to ESRD as a result of relapses after PE 
[23,79,81]. However, it remains unclear whether per￾sistent or progressive kidney function deterioration de￾spite plasma therapy reflects unresolved active kidney 
inflammation or merely chronic ischemic changes.
Eculizumab
Eculizumab, a monoclonal antibody that blocks the 
cleavage of C5, is the first-line treatment for patients 
with aHUS [82]. Early initiation of eculizumab has been 
effective for minimizing renal damage [83]. If eculizum￾ab is unavailable, PE and/or plasma infusion can be 
considered.
The dosage and schedule of eculizumab should be 
adjusted according to body weight, as in Table 1 [9]. Pa￾tients should receive meningococcal vaccination at least 
2 weeks prior to the first dose of eculizumab because the 
drug increases the risk of meningococcal infection. If 
eculizumab treatment is initiated less than 2 weeks after 
vaccination, patients should receive additional prophy￾lactic antibiotics until 2 weeks after vaccination [84].
Ravulizumab, a long-acting C5 inhibitor, was ap￾proved by the Food and Drug Administration for the 
treatment of adult and pediatric patients ≥ 1 month of 
age with aHUS to inhibit complement-mediated TMA. 
Ravulizumab treatment of aHUS should be maintained 
for a minimum duration of 6 months; extension be￾yond 6 months should be determined on an individual 
basis. Ravulizumab reduces the treatment burden, with 
infusions limited to once every 4 or 8 weeks depending 
on body weight. Further studies are needed regarding 
its use in pregnant women [85].
Kidney transplantation
Prevention of TMA after KT
After KT, the recurrence rate of aHUS is high (approx￾imately 60%) and that of graft survival is poor (approx￾imately 90%) [86]. Advances in genetics and the devel￾opment of eculizumab have altered the preparation and 
treatment of patients with aHUS after KT.
Candidates for KT who have genetic mutations as￾sociated with aHUS require some precautions in ac￾cordance with risk stratification based on the mutated 
gene. Patients with MCP, DGKE, undetectable anti-CFH 
autoantibody, and no mutation are regarded as low￾risk for post-transplant TMA. In contrast, patients with 
CFH, CFI, C3, CFB, CFH/CFHR1 hybrid, or combined 
mutations and no mutation are regarded as moderate￾to-high-risk for aHUS recurrence [18,31,34,36]. For the

latter group of patients, the following donors should be 
excluded [34,36]: (1) positive cross-match or donor-spe￾cific antibody results; (2) deceased donors with extend￾ed criteria; and (3) living related donors without genetic 
test results. Immunosuppressants such as low-dose cal￾cineurin inhibitors or belatacept should be used, while 
mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors should be 
avoided [18,31,32,34,36]. Anti-meningococcal vaccination, 
cytomegalovirus prophylaxis, influenza vaccination, and 
regular monitoring for infection should be performed 
(Fig. 3) [34,36].
Experts, including the Kidney Disease Improving 
Global Outcomes workgroup, recommend the prophy￾lactic use of eculizumab in KT recipients with a high 
risk of recurrence based on genetic mutations [18,34,36]. 
For prophylactic use, eculizumab should be adminis￾tered prior to surgery (i.e., on day 0 of transplantation) 
[18,31,34,80]. An additional dose was recommended on 
day 1 after surgery in some reports [80,87,88]. The use of 
eculizumab as a preemptive strategy in KT candidates 
with known aHUS is ongoing. Several studies have re￾ported the clinical outcomes of KT recipients with ec￾ulizumab prophylaxis [89-91]. The results showed that 
eculizumab prophylaxis at the time of KT markedly 
reduced the incidence of recurrent TMA events, com￾pared to data from the era before eculizumab [28,86]. In 
addition, eculizumab prophylaxis during preparation 
for KT resulted in better allograft outcomes than ini￾tiation of eculizumab following recurrence after KT. 
Emerging evidence suggests that eculizumab prophy￾laxis before KT is reasonable. However, plasmapheresis 
may be an alternative prophylactic strategy if eculizum￾ab access is difficult [80,88,92].
Therapeutic strategies for recurrent aHUS in kidney trans￾plantation
If any feature of TMA is observed after KT, early sus￾picion is important to improve clinical outcomes. Pa￾tients with post-transplant TMA exhibit different clin￾ical features. In patients who exhibit only a change in 
renal function, allograft biopsy is necessary to confirm 
the diagnosis [31,37]. Therapeutic strategies such as plas￾mapheresis, immunosuppressant conversion, and re￾jection treatment should be implemented without de￾lay [32]. Patients with post-transplant TMA showed an 
acceptable response to plasmapheresis in some studies 
[29,93,94]. However, patients who become dependent 
on or refractory to plasmapheresis should be consid￾ered for conversion to eculizumab [32,36]. Eculizumab 
contributed to the prevention and treatment of aHUS 
recurrence in KT recipients, whereas plasmapheresis 
was ineffective [95].
Treatment of pediatric aHUS
TTP is the first condition to be excluded in adult pa￾tients with probable aHUS; therefore, PE is typically 
applied until the ADAMTS13 activity result is reported. 
However, in children, TTP is uncommon and PE is not 
regarded as first-line treatment. Moreover, PE may in￾duce complications related to central line catheter and 
extracorporeal circulation, particularly in young chil￾dren (< 6 years of age). Therefore, PE should be applied 
only when necessary.
When primary aHUS and complement activation are 
suspected in children, the first-line treatment is admin￾istration of plasma to provide complement activation 
regulators that may be defective in the patient. Indeed, 
the treatment of choice is complement activation inhib￾ESRD secondary to aHUS

itors, such as eculizumab. However, approval by Korean 
national health insurance is time-consuming, such that 
eculizumab may not be available immediately. Plasma 
infusion can ameliorate aHUS; therefore, it should be 
performed as a bridge treatment. When plasma infusion 
leads to volume overload or anti-CFH autoantibody is 
suspected, plasmapheresis is needed. When eculizumab 
becomes available, it should be administered immedi￾ately after vaccination for meningococcus, because un￾treated aHUS in children can be fatal; notably, delayed 
treatment results in kidney damage.
If a patient has a CFH mutation and experiences mul￾tiple relapses, liver transplantation can be considered 
because the majority of plasma CFH is produced by 
the liver. There have been several reports of successful 
liver transplantation that led to no further relapses [96]. 
While successful liver transplantation can cure CFH-as￾sociated recurrent aHUS, recipients of liver transplan￾tation require immunosuppressive agents to prevent 
rejection, which leads to an immunocompromised 
state and an increased risk of infection and malignan￾cy. These risks are in addition to medication-specific 
side effects such as growth impairment for steroids or 
post-transplant diabetes mellitus for calcineurin in￾hibitors. Therefore, the cost and risk of meningococcal 
infection during life-long treatment with eculizumab 
should be compared with the life-long side effects of 
liver transplantation. In addition, liver transplantation 
is applicable only for patients with CFH mutations, 
as well as those with CFI mutations, because the main 
source of CFH and CFI is the liver; for patients with 
mutations in other genes, liver transplantation is not 
available.
Key message
• Eculizumab is the first-line treatment for adult 
and pediatric patients with aHUS. If eculizum￾ab is unavailable, PE and/or plasma infusion 
should be considered.
• KT recipients with a moderate-to-high risk of 
recurrence should receive prophylactic treat￾ment with eculizumab. After KT, eculizumab 
should be considered for patients with TMA 
refractory to rejection therapy, immunosup￾pressant conversion, and plasmapheresis.
CONCLUSIONS
In this article, we defined the clinical diagnosis of TMA 
syndromes and proposed approaches for their differen￾tial diagnoses. The diagnosis of aHUS is complex and 
challenging, but is essential because of the devastating 
consequences of inadequate treatment. Advances in our 
understanding of the clinical, molecular, and function￾al aspects of the pathogenesis of aHUS are ongoing and 
have resulted in the development of novel therapeutic 
options. Several areas require further investigation, 
including factors that trigger aHUS and the optimal 
duration of treatment. Clinicians may refer to this cur￾rent consensus for insights regarding diagnosis and 
treatment strategies for patients with aHUS.
