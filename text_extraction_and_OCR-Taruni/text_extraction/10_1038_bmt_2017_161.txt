The advances in hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) over the last decade have led to a transplant-related mortality below 15%.
Hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome/veno-occlusive disease (SOS/VOD) is a life-threatening complication of HCT that belongs
to a group of diseases increasingly identified as transplant-related, systemic endothelial diseases. In most cases, SOS/VOD resolves
within weeks; however, severe SOS/VOD results in multi-organ dysfunction/failure with a mortality rate 480%. A timely diagnosis of
SOS/VOD is of critical importance, given the availability of therapeutic options with favorable tolerability. Current diagnostic criteria
are used for adults and children. However, over the last decade it has become clear that SOS/VOD is significantly different between
the age groups in terms of incidence, genetic predisposition, clinical presentation, prevention, treatment and outcome. Improved
understanding of SOS/VOD and the availability of effective treatment questions the use of the Baltimore and Seattle criteria for
diagnosing SOS/VOD in children. The aim of this position paper is to propose new diagnostic and severity criteria for SOS/VOD in
children on behalf of the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.

INTRODUCTION
Major advances in hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) over
the last decade have substantially decreased transplant-related
morbidity and mortality; the expected mortality rate is now less
than 15%.1 Hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD), also called
sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS; referred to as SOS/VOD
hereafter) belongs to a group of conditions increasingly
designated as transplant-related, systemic endothelial diseases,
that include acute GvHD, engraftment syndrome and transplant￾associated microangiopathy (TAM). SOS/VOD is an unpredictable
and potentially life-threatening complication of HCT.2,3
The primary insult in SOS/VOD is injury to both sinusoidal
endothelial cells and hepatocytes in zone 3 of the hepatic acinus,4
triggered by several factors, such as the toxicity of the
conditioning regimen, release of cytokines due to inflammation
and engraftment, release of endotoxins, phenomena of
alloreactivity, protein C anticoagulant pathway abnormalities
and use of calcineurin inhibitors. Furthermore, monoclonal
antibodies tagged with calicheamicin derivatives, such as
gemtuzumab ozogamicin and inotuzumab ozogamicin, are
triggers of SOS/VOD and onset can occur after Ab administration

alone or in subsequent HCT.5–7 Particularly in children, SOS/VOD
can also occur as a complication of conventional radio- and
chemotherapy outside of the transplant setting.8–11 In addition to
the triggers listed above, the risk of SOS/VOD is also dependent on
patient-specific factors including genetic predisposition.12–14
While SOS/VOD usually resolves within weeks in most patients, an
estimated 30–60% of affected children may progress to
multi-organ dysfunction/failure (MOD/MOF).4,15–17 In 20% of cases,
SOS/VOD develops more than 30 days after HCT.15,18,19 The clinical
presentation of SOS/VOD consists of hepatomegaly, ascites and
weight gain. SOS/VOD is essentially a clinical diagnosis in the
absence of sensitive and specific biologic markers or imaging
tools.20–27 Two sets of diagnostic criteria for SOS/VOD have been
used in clinical practice for the past three decades:15,17 the
Baltimore28 and Seattle criteria,29 the latter subsequently modified
by a number of minor adjustments.15,30,31 Based on these criteria,
the incidence of SOS/VOD ranges between 10 and 60% in allogeneic
HCTs with myeloablative conditioning (MAC) regimens, and
between 5 and 30% in autologous HCT.16 SOS/VOD is seen
significantly less often in patients who undergo reduced-intensity/
toxicity conditioning regimens.16,32–35 In children, the average
incidence of SOS/VOD is 20%, but in specific conditions can rise to
60%. This incidence is higher than that reported in adults.15,36–38
Of note, the incidence of SOS/VOD differs by the criteria
used for diagnosis, with up to a four-fold increased incidence of
SOS/VOD observed between the Baltimore and Seattle criteria,
respectively.15,16,34
The specific risk factors in children and the availability of effective
licensed agents with favorable adverse-event profiles support the
need for diagnostic and severity criteria specific to children.
Rationale for new diagnostic criteria: are children different from
adults?
Currently the same diagnostic criteria for SOS/VOD are used in
adults and children. This is despite evidence that the disorder
differs significantly between children and adults in terms of
incidence, genetic predisposition, clinical presentation and the
outcomes of prevention and treatment (Table 1). Such differences
suggest that the currently used criteria are no longer appropriate
for the diagnosis of SOS/VOD in children. The aim of this position
paper is to propose diagnostic and severity criteria for SOS/VOD
in pediatric patients on behalf of the European Society for Blood
and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT).
In terms of treatment, several studies over the last two decades
have demonstrated that defibrotide (DF) is effective for the
treatment and prevention of SOS/VOD when used in combination
with supportive care.15,38–45 DF has European Medicines
Agency authorization for the treatment of severe SOS/VOD and
most recently received approval from the Food and Drug
Administration in the USA.17,46 For treatment an international
compassionate use program reported a superior outcome in
children compared with adults.47 Early intervention with
DF associated with a superior outcome was also shown first
in children.48 The results of an expanded access
Treatment-Investigational New Drug program, evaluating DF for
the treatment of SOS/VOD, confirmed that earlier initiation of DF
treatment was associated with significantly higher day +100
probability of survival.49
Risk factors and incidence in children
Risk factors can be divided into those directly related to the
transplant, those related to patient characteristics including the
underlying disease, and those related to hepatic factors.50 Factors
directly related to the pre-transplant regimen and transplant
include the use of ozogamicin-linked antibodies (gemtuzumab
and inotuzumab) prior to transplantation, use of drugs for
conditioning known to be toxic to the endothelium (such as
high-dose busulfan (BU), single-fraction or high-dose fractionated
(⩾12 Gray) TBI-based conventional MAC,16,33,35,51,52 and/or a
combination of BU and cyclophosphamide and/or melphalan)
and prior HCT. All of the above predispose children to
SOS/VOD.15,19 Targeted IV BU has a predictable pharmacokinetic
profile,53,54 but the measurement of BU serum levels is
complicated by differences in methodology and lack of a reliable
target range for safety, in particular when given as part of
combination chemotherapy. Therefore, targeted IV BU cannot
guarantee a reduced incidence of SOS/VOD.15,55–58
In summary, although treatment-related risk factors are similar
between children and adults, the influence of individual risk
factors related to patient characteristics (such as age of onset of
primary disease and potentially genotype13) is greater in children
than adults.

EBMT criteria for diagnosis and severity of SOS/VOD in children

A number of diseases, which are more common in childhood,
can lead to an increased risk of SOS/VOD. For example, the
reported incidence of SOS/VOD in infantile osteopetrosis is
60%.15,38,59 In congenital macrophage activation syndromes,
such as familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, Griscelli
syndrome and X-linked lymphoproliferative disease, the reported
incidence of SOS/VOD is 30%.15,60 Patients with thalassemia with
hepatomegaly and high iron overload have a reported incidence
of 30–40%.61–63 High-risk neuroblastoma is currently treated in
Europe with high-dose chemotherapy and autologous HCT,
usually after conditioning with BU/melphalan. Compared with
the o5% overall incidence of SOS/VOD following autologous HCT
in adults,16,32 the reported 15–30% incidence in children with
neuroblastoma is exceedingly high.15,37,58,64–66 SOS/VOD has
been reported in children with Wilm's tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma
and brain tumors given conventional chemotherapy, particularly
in combination therapies including actinomycin D.9,67–69 Sickle cell
disease may also potentially carry a high risk of SOS/VOD during
transplant due to a combination of a systemic vasculopathy,
iron overload/liver fibrosis and hepatitis. Above all, with a reported
overall incidence of 30%,15,70 infants are probably the largest
group at risk of SOS/VOD. This might be attributable to the
immaturity of the liver in this age group.
In summary, the overall incidence of SOS/VOD in children
and infants is between 22% and 30%, respectively, approximately
two- to threefold higher than in adults. Under certain
circumstances, the incidence can be as high as 60%, indicating
that SOS/VOD is more prevalent in childhood.15,36,37
Clinical presentation
The clinical presentation of SOS/VOD in children differs in several
important respects from that in adults. The disease usually peaks
around day +12 after HCT in both children and adults. However,
while late-onset SOS/VOD is rare in adults,19,71,72 in children,
15–20% of SOS/VOD cases15,36,37 present beyond day +30, a time
exceeding the 21- and 20- day limits specified by the Baltimore28
and Seattle criteria,29 respectively.
These sets of criteria31 also require a weight gain of 5 and 2%,
respectively. In children a weight gain of 2% can be of
doubtful significance. In particular, in infants, rapid
weight changes due to iatrogenic fluid overload or inaccurate
measurements, including the weight of clothing and diapers, can
easily falsify results. Therefore, the Seattle criteria have been
modified to require a 5% weight gain in children to improve
specificity.15 However a single weight measurement does not
reflect the dynamics of this disease.
The original publication of the Seattle criteria refers to
‘painful hepatomegaly’ as a criterion,29 whereas the subsequent
publication lists ‘right upper quadrant pain’ as an independent
criterion.30 In children, assessment of right upper quadrant pain is
difficult, particularly in infants and toddlers, making this a
subjective criterion in a high-risk pediatric patient population.
The sine qua non Baltimore criterion is hyperbilirubinemia
⩾2 mg/dL, which is an apparently objective and investigator￾independent marker. However, anicteric SOS/VOD was observed
in 32% of patients in the pediatric prevention trial, including those
experiencing severe disease.15 This observation was confirmed in
two independent publications, which reported an incidence
of anicteric SOS/VOD of 30 and 29%, respectively.73,74 Anicteric
SOS/VOD seems to be particularly prevalent in children, although
it is also seen in adults with late-onset SOS/VOD.18,19,75 Reflecting
this, the new EBMT criteria for adults follow the Baltimore criteria
of bilirubin ⩾ 2 mg/dL for early-onset SOS/VOD (o21 days), but
omit hyperbilirubinemia as an obligatory criterion for late-onset
SOS/VOD.50
Prompt diagnosis and early intervention are crucial in patients
with SOS/VOD before they develop MOD/MOF with its associated
high mortality rate.34,49 Applying the Baltimore criteria for
hyperbilirubinemia could mean that up to one-third of pediatric
patients would currently fail to meet the diagnostic criteria of
SOS/VOD and would therefore be excluded from timely and
effective therapy. In terms of disease severity, hyperbilirubinemia
is often a late finding in SOS/VOD, which reflects more advanced
and perhaps irreversible hepatic injury, associated with a worse
outcome. Naples et al.74 reported that the total treatment duration
was longer and that the level of supportive care required was
significantly higher in SOS/VOD patients with icterus compared
with those without hyperbilirubinemia (P = 0.224 and P = 0.0081,
respectively). In the pediatric prevention trial, the 60% incidence
of MOD/MOF in patients who were diagnosed according to the
Baltimore criteria was significantly higher than the 32% incidence
seen in patients without hyperbilirubinemia (P = 0.038).15
Carreras et al. reported on 845 allogeneic HCTs, where SOS/VOD
was diagnosed using both the Seattle criteria, where bilirubin
⩾2 mg/dL is not diagnostic prerequisite, and the Baltimore
criteria, with a cumulative incidence of 13.8% (n = 117) and 8.8%
(n = 73), respectively. Of the 117 patients diagnosed according to
the Seattle criteria, 37.6 (n = 44) did not develop hyperbilirubine￾mia and therefore did not fulfill the Baltimore criteria; none of
them developed MOD/MOF or had severe VOD. All MOD/MOF
cases occurred in the group that fulfilled the Baltimore criteria.34
In a Japanese meta-analysis, the overall survival (OS) between
patients diagnosed according to the Seattle or Baltimore criteria
differed substantially.35 Jones et al.28 reported that only 1 out of
25 patients with VOD with a serum bilirubin level higher than 15
mg/dL survived. Finally many pediatric diseases, such as
thalassemia, sickle cell disease, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocy￾tosis, osteopetrosis and others, present with conjugated
hyperbilirubinemia independently of HCT, so that a diagnostic
limit of 2 mg/dL is inappropriate.
The specificity of the Baltimore and Seattle criteria have been
reported to be 89 and 95%, respectively,28,29 however, the
sensitivity was low (56%).76 With an average 30% incidence of
anicteric SOS/VOD in children, the estimate on specificity should
be revised.
The recently revised diagnostic criteria for adults considered the
inclusion of transfusion-refractory thrombocytopenia (RT) as a
diagnostic criterion; however, this was excluded owing to the
difficulty in evaluating RT during the pancytopenic phase after
HCT.50 The current understanding of the pathophysiology of
SOS/VOD is that a sustained and uncontrolled endothelial/
sinusoidal activation is the primary triggering event. There
is ample evidence that consumptive thrombocytopenia and
refractoriness to platelet transfusions, most probably due to
uncontrolled endothelial activation, is a hallmark of
SOS/VOD.28,71,77–81 As early as 1993, McDonald et al.30 noticed
an increased transfusion requirement before the onset of liver
disease, most markedly in severe SOS/VOD. In clinical practice,
after the exclusion of alternative causes, such as sepsis, TAM and
other causes of consumptive thrombocytopenia, and Ab-mediated
thrombocytopenia, the need for daily, or even more frequent
platelet transfusion justifies a high level of suspicion of SOS/VOD.
Imaging techniques
Hepatomegaly and ascites are two major diagnostic Seattle and
Baltimore criteria, although the means of assessment have
never been specified. Since publication of both sets of criteria
there have been rapid advances in diagnostic imaging, such as
computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging and
ultrasonography (US). These objective tools can enable the
accurate assessment of both liver size and the presence of ascites.
US is almost universally available, often as a bedside tool, and is
therefore very useful for the confirmation of clinically suspected
hepatomegaly and ascites. CT and magnetic resonance imaging

can substitute for or complement US. Although both are less
operator-dependent than US, their use is hampered by either
exposure to radiation and/or the need for sedation in younger
children. Furthermore, repetitive examinations to assess the
dynamics of the disease are impractical and potentially harmful
for immunocompromised children, as they would have to leave
their protected environment, potentially exposing them to an
increased risk of infection.
The diagnostic specificity of SOS/VOD has not been improved
beyond hepatomegaly and ascites by the addition of hepatic
artery resistive index, velocity of portal venous flow, increased
periportal echogenicity and increased hepatic echotexture, as well
as the assessment of gallbladder wall thickening.27,82,83
Measurement of the hepatic venous gradient pressure by
cannulation of the jugular vein was demonstrated in adults to be a
very accurate, but invasive, technique to confirm the diagnosis of
SOS/VOD.75,84,85 Neither the efficacy nor safety of this procedure
has been verified in children, therefore hepatic venous gradient
pressure cannot be recommended as a tool for early diagnosis,
particularly in infants and toddlers.
Doppler US assesses hepatic and portal vascular flow, pressure
abnormalities and hepatic arterial early acceleration indices.
Although they correlated best with HVPG, these techniques are
subjective and very dependent on the experience of the operator.
In addition, these findings, in particular portal venous flow reversal
(hepatofugal flow), are either not consistently present or are a late
finding, and might therefore be useful for the assessment of
severity rather than early diagnosis.26,86–89 Most importantly, even
in patients with severe and very severe SOS/VOD, hepatofugal
flow can be absent, and should not be used as a criterion of
exclusion.90
In summary, although serial clinical examination and weight
monitoring remain the basic standard for assessing SOS/VOD, the
most practicable imaging tool to confirm the clinical diagnosis of
hepatomegaly and ascites is US. In general, baseline and serial
measurements by any imaging tool are mandatory for early
detection of any changes in liver size and/or presence of ascitic
fluid. Similar to pre-existing hyperbilirubinemia, diseases, such
as thalassemia, sickle cell disease, hemophagocytic lymphohistio￾cytosis or osteopetrosis and others, mostly transplanted during
childhood, may present with pre-existing hepatomegaly and
ascites before transplantation.
New EBMT criteria for the diagnosis of SOS/VOD in children
The proposed EBMT criteria for the diagnosis of SOS/VOD in
pediatric patients are summarized in Table 2. These criteria
acknowledge the differences in various aspects of the disease
between children and adults, and recognize the recent evidence
of the superiority of early intervention. The proposals are based
on reviews of the literature, and the experience and opinions of
the authors. It is acknowledged that the proposed criteria
should ideally be prospectively validated in clinical studies and
tested in daily practice, with periodic reassessment to reflect
changes in data and/or methodology.
As approximately one-fifth of the patients are diagnosed
after 21 days post HCT, and reflecting the new EBMT criteria for
adults,50 there should be no time limit for the diagnosis of
late-onset SOS/VOD also in children.
Given the early onset of consumptive and transfusion-refractory
thrombocytopenia in children, consumptive RT, defined as the
need for at least daily platelet transfusions after the exclusion of
other obvious causes, is viewed as an early and sensitive sign of
SOS/VOD.
In children, daily measurements of weight and abdominal
circumference may suggest the need for further investigations to
assess hepatomegaly and ascites. A weight gain beyond 2% in a
single measurement, as required by the Seattle criteria, can be
misleading in children. Instead, the dynamics of endothelial
damage and associated third spacing is better reflected by
consecutive measurements over several days. Therefore, the
pediatric EBMT criteria require a weight gain on 3 consecutive
days, excluding other plausible causes, in addition to refractori￾ness to diuretic treatment. An unexplained weight gain of at least
5%, as required by the Baltimore criteria, will be retained.
Proper assessment of ascites and hepatomegaly and of their
dynamics over time using radiation-free imaging techniques is
recommended. This recommendation has the purpose of
improving the sensitivity and specificity of the criteria, particularly
in a patient population with a high prevalence of pre-existing
ascites and hepatomegaly. For reasons of sensitivity
and specificity, the decision should not be based on clinical
examination only. A mandatory prerequisite is the comparability
with a baseline examination. Therefore, the EBMT criteria
suggest that the clinical diagnoses of ascites and hepatomegaly
are verified with reproducible and objective diagnostic
imaging tools. For the purpose of defining liver size and the
amount of free abdominal fluid, US seems the most appropriate
tool; CT and magnetic resonance imaging are acceptable but
more complicated to perform in children.
As hyperbilirubinemia (42 mg/dL bilirubin) in children is
frequently either absent or found only in advanced-stage severe
SOS/VOD73,74 and because many children have pre-existing
hyperbilirubinemia related to their primary disease, this criterion
is difficult to use. For these reasons, pediatric EBMT criteria
recognize anicteric SOS/VOD as a frequent entity and consider
hyperbilirubinemia as a non-mandatory criterion. Instead of a
predefined level of hyperbilirubinemia in children, the new
EBMT criteria require the bilirubin level to rise from an individual
baseline on 3 consecutive days, after the exclusion of competing
causes.
Transjugular liver biopsy provides histologic evidence of
SOS/VOD, and is frequently used in adults.84,85 However, it is an
invasive technique, difficult to perform in children and dangerous
in patients with profound thrombocytopenia. In this respect, a
recent study91 summarized a single institution experience on the

safety and utility of liver biopsies after pediatric HCT. This study
reported on 16 patients who received 18 liver biopsies. Five of
these were by the transjugular route. Complications occurred
after five biopsies, four of which were transjugular. The most
common complication was hemorrhage. Two of these patients
required transfer to the intensive care unit for procedure-related
complications.91 This experience suggests that transjugular liver
biopsies should be avoided in children.
New EBMT criteria for grading the severity of SOS/VOD in children
The implementation of pediatric EBMT criteria for SOS/VOD offers
the potential for early therapeutic intervention with effective and
well-tolerated drugs, which may impact on the presentation,
incidence of severity and outcome of SOS/VOD. Consequently, the
implementation of severity criteria for children is mandatory. Chao
et al.92 and Carreras et al.75 proposed a grading system for adults
implementing the five categories from the CTCAE (Common
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events): grade 1 = mild, grade
2 = moderate, grade 3 = severe, grade 4 = very severe and grade
5 = death, which was adopted in the new severity criteria for
adults.50 The proposed criteria for severity grading of SOS/VOD in
pediatric patients are summarized in Table 3.
Owing to the primarily endothelial/sinusoidal nature of the
disease, elevated transaminases are not usually found in the early
stages of SOS/VOD when primary hepatocytic toxicity, such
as infections and drug toxicity, should be excluded. Rising
transaminases after the diagnosis of SOS/VOD reflect hepatocyte
failure and advanced-stage disease (CTCAE level 4). Glutamate
dehydrogenase is a liver-specific enzyme with mitochondrial
expression, particularly in the central, perivenular hepatocytes of
the liver lobule (zone 3 of the hepatic acinus). As such, an
elevation of glutamate dehydrogenase may reflect severe
hepatocellular damage and could be considered a more reliable
assessment of severity in SOS/VOD in the future.
Persistent RT for 47 days despite early therapeutic intervention
represents severe disease.30
Bilirubin ⩾ 2 mg/dL is associated with morbidity and a worse OS
despite pre-emptive therapeutic intervention,15,73,74 and therefore
defines severe SOS/VOD in children.
Ascites and third spacing during the course of SOS/VOD have
been recognized as criteria of severity. This mirrors the Bearman
criteria, according to which early onset or marked weight gain
were considered diagnostic of severe SOS/VOD.79,93 A precise
measurement of ascitic fluid is not possible, but the need
for paracentesis to release abdominal pressure and alleviate
respiratory distress is a criterion of severe SOS/VOD. Furthermore,
repeated drainage of peritoneal fluid over a defined period is a
sign of uncontrolled disease.
A combination of two of the following criteria: persistent ascitic
drainage, persistent RT, sustained high levels of liver function
indexes (transaminases, glutamate dehydrogenase) and bilirubin
⩾2 mg/dL defines very severe SOS/VOD (CTCAE grade 4) and
predicts for an increased risk of death and the need for prolonged
treatment.
Similar to the severity criteria for adults, the kinetics of symptom
presentation is critical to evaluating the severity of SOS/VOD in
children. The combination of several of the SOS/VOD-related
signs mentioned above, within 48 h, is likely to lead to severe
SOS/VOD.75,79,93 In particular, a doubling of the bilirubin level from
an individual baseline within 48 h should be considered a sign of
severe SOS/VOD.
Patients requiring replacement of coagulation factors after the
established diagnosis of SOS/VOD are considered to suffer from
consumptive coagulopathy associated with hepatic failure.
Severe SOS/VOD resulting in MOD/MOF, is characterized by
pulmonary and/or renal dysfunction and/or encephalopathy.16,17
Any combination of organ failure in SOS/VOD classifies very severe
disease.

EBMT criteria for diagnosis and severity of SOS/VOD in children

CONCLUSIONS
By defining specific diagnostic and severity criteria for SOS/VOD in
children, the group of EBMT experts aimed to overcome the
weaknesses associated with the currently used criteria. This
modification acknowledges both the pediatric-specific risk factors
for SOS/VOD and the availability of an effective treatment option
for children. Similar to the new EBMT criteria for adults, the group
acknowledges that these proposals should be tested in daily
practice and prospectively validated in clinical trials. These new
criteria must stand the test of time and be periodically re-assessed,
particularly biomarkers and imaging tools.
In summary, implementation of the proposed EBMT criteria
for diagnosis and assessment of the severity of SOS/VOD
will hopefully lead to earlier identification of patients in need of
pre-emptive intervention with effective drugs for the treatment
of SOS/VOD, and to the possibility of a predictive assessment of
treatment effectiveness and outcome.94
