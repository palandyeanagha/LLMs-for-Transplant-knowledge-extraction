Abstract
Importance and Objective: Besides their role in diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (MI), troponins may be powerful
biomarkers for risk stratification in the general population. The objective of our study was to compare the performance of
three troponin assays in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk prediction in a population-based cohort without a history of CVD
events.
Design, Setting and Participants: Troponin I concentrations were measured using a contemporary-sensitivity, high￾sensitivity, and super-sensitivity assay in 7,899 participants of the general-population based FINRISK 1997 cohort. We used
Cox proportional hazards regression to determine relative risks, followed by measures of discrimination and reclassification
using 10-fold cross-validation to control for over-optimism.
Main Outcome: As outcome measures we used CVD, MI, ischemic stroke, heart failure (HF), and major adverse cardiac
events (MACE). During the follow-up of 14 years 1,074 incident MACE were observed.
Results: Values above the lower limit of detection were observed in 26.4%, 81.5% and 93.9% for the contemporary￾sensitivity, high-sensitivity and super-sensitivity assay, respectively. We observed significant associations of troponin
concentrations with the risk of future CVD events and the results tended to become stronger with increasing assay
sensitivity. For the super-sensitivity assay the multivariate adjusted hazard ratios (per one standard deviation increase) for
different outcomes were: MI 1.24 [95% CI 1.11–1.39], stroke 1.14 [1.01–1.28], CVD 1.15 [1.07–1.24], HF 1.28 [1.18–1.39], and
MACE 1.18 [1.11–1.25]. In subjects with intermediate risk, we found an improvement of net reclassification for HF (10.2%,
p,0.001), and MACE (5.1%, p,0.001).
Conclusion: Using a super-sensitivity assay, cardiac troponin was detectable in almost all healthy individuals. Its
concentration improved risk prediction and reclassification for cardiovascular endpoints.

Introduction
The cardiac-specific protein complex troponin is released in
conditions of myocardial damage, and therefore its use as a
necrosis marker for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction
(MI) is well established [1,2]. Application of sensitive cardiac
troponin assays allow an early distinction between acute MI, and
other acute cardiac events [3].
Identifying individuals with increased risk for incident cardiovas￾cular diseases (CVD) is a major aim in primary prevention [4].
Thus, the use of biomarkers to identify and monitor individuals at
high risk of CVD is emerging [5]. Besides the role in diagnosis of
acute cardiac events, troponin T was shown to be a powerful
biomarker for risk stratification in individuals with stable athero￾sclerotic disease [6,7]. With troponin T assays it is possible to
measure troponin concentration in approximately 25% of the

general population. Using new high-sensitivity troponin I assays, it is
now possible to measure very low troponin concentrations in more
than 50% of healthy individuals, and with super-sensitivity troponin
I assays in more than 95% of healthy individuals [8]. In patients
with stable coronary heart disease, troponin concentrations
measured by high-sensitivity assays were significantly associated
with cardiovascular death and heart failure [9]. Furthermore, it was
shown to be a prognostic marker for MI and cardiovascular death in
a population with increased cardiovascular risk [10]. In a
population-based setting, concentrations of high-sensitivity assayed
troponin were associated with an increased risk for all-cause
mortality [8,11]. In the population-based Framingham Heart Study
and the Minnesota Heart Survey troponin concentrations measured
by a super-sensitivity troponin assay were significantly associated
with major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), heart failure
(HF), and cardiovascular death [12,13].
The use of more sensitive troponin assays has revealed a high
prognostic potential of low troponin concentrations, but their
clinical value in risk prediction has not been established and may
depend on the sensitivity of the assay in question. Therefore, the
objective of our study was to examine the hypothesis that a more
sensitive assay detects more individuals at risk of future cardio￾vascular disease in a population-based cohort without a history of
prior MACE. To address this issue, we measured troponin
concentrations using a contemporary-sensitivity, high-sensitivity,
and super-sensitivity troponin assay in 7,899 participants of the
FINRISK 1997 cohort followed up for 14 years.
Methods
Study population
The present study included 8,444 individuals from the
FINRISK study enrolled in 1997. This prospective population￾based study was carried out in five districts of Finland, including
North Karelia, Northern Savo (former Kuopio), Southwestern
Finland, Oulu province, and the region of Helsinki and Vantaa. A
stratified, random sample was drawn from the national population
register, the age-range was 25–74 years. All individuals enrolled in
the study received a physical examination, a self-administered
questionnaire, and a blood sample was drawn. Altogether, 11,500
individuals were invited and 8,444 (73%) participated in the
clinical examination. Individuals with a prevalent history of
MACE (n = 470) and pregnant women (n = 76) were excluded
from the present analysis. During a follow-up of up to 14 years, the
National Hospital Discharge Register, the National Causes of
Death Register and the National Drug Reimbursement Register
were used to identify the endpoints [14]. The design of the
FINRISK study has been published before [15]. The Ethics
Committee of the National Public Health Institute approved the
study, which followed the Declaration of Helsinki. All subjects
gave written informed consent.
Cardiovascular risk factors and diseases
The blood pressure measurement was performed on the right
arm in a sitting position after a 5-minute phase of rest. The cuff
length was 40 cm. The mean of two measurements was used in the
analyses. Data on the use of antihypertensive medications were
collected with the questionnaire. Arterial hypertension was defined
according to the American Heart Association (AHA) definition,
meaning a blood pressure $140 mmHg systolic or $90 mmHg
diastolic, or the use of antihypertensive medication. Smokers were
classified by questionnaire as active smokers (smoking regularly $1
year and during the past 6 months), former smokers (smoked
regularly $1 year and quit smoking $6 months before the survey),
and non-smokers (never smoked regularly). Diabetes was defined
either as previously diagnosed diabetes or impaired glucose
tolerance by a physician, or by taking any hypoglycemic drugs.
Defined Endpoints
The follow-up rate was 100% for the participants who
continued living in Finland. Those who had permanently moved
abroad (0.5% of the participants prior to Dec 31st, 2010) were lost
to follow-up. The study endpoints were defined as follows. CVD
included MI, coronary death, hospitalized unstable angina
pectoris, any coronary revascularization, and ischemic stroke.
Further endpoints were incident ischemic stroke (hemorrhagic
strokes were excluded), incident HF, and MACE (CVD or HF). In
a sub-analysis we further distinguished fatal MI from non-fatal MI.
The use of Finnish national health care registries for identifying
these cardiovascular outcomes has been validated [16].
Laboratory methods
Prior to drawing the blood samples, the individuals were asked for
a 4-hour fasting period, avoiding heavy meals during the day. The
median fasting time was 5 hours with an interquartile range of 3–
7 hours. The blood samples were stored under standardized
conditions at 270uC. Most routine laboratory parameters were
measured at the Disease Risk Unit in the National Institute for
Health and Welfare, Helsinki. The measurement of CRP, N￾terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), and the
different troponin assays were performed at the MORGAM
Biomarker Laboratory, University Heart Center Hamburg, Ger￾many, which was formerly located at the University Medical Center
Mainz, Germany. The contemporary-sensitivity troponin I assay
(STAT troponin I immunoassay, Abbott Diagnostics, USA;
ARCHITECT i2000SR) was considered valid for values above
the limit of detection (LOD) of 10 pg/mL, but observed values
below this limit were also used in the analysis (assay range 0–
50,000 pg/mL). The 10% coefficient of variation was at 32 pg/mL.
Troponin was also assessed using a prototype high-sensitivity
cardiac troponin assay (ARCHITECT STAT highly sensitive
troponin I immunoassay, Abbott Diagnostics, USA, ARCHITECT
i2000SR). The established LOD for the assay ranges from 0.8–1.9
with a median of 1.5 pg/mL. For analyses, a LOD of 1.9 pg/mL
was considered. Observed values below this limit were also included
in the analysis (assay range 0–50,000 pg/mL). The 10 percent
coefficient of variation was at 5.2 pg/mL. The concentration
representing the 99th percentile in the reference population was
30 pg/mL in 4,139 individuals of the population-based Gutenberg
Health Study [1]. The super-sensitivity troponin I (Erenna Cardiac
troponin-I immunoassay, Singulex, USA) had a median LOD of
1.0 pg/mL and an assay range of 0.1–600 pg/mL. The 10%
coefficient of variation was between 0.78 and 1.6 pg/mL [17].
Again, values below the LOD were included in the analysis.
Statistical analysis
Baseline characteristics are presented as counts and percentages
for dichotomous variables, and as median and IQR for continuous
variables. Age and sex adjusted Kaplan-Meier-curves for MACE
and HF were produced using categorized troponin concentrations.
For the contemporary-sensitivity assay, we used 1 pg/mL (lowest
observed non-zero value) and 10 pg/mL (assay threshold) as cut￾points. For the high-sensitivity assay, we used 1.9 pg/mL (assay
threshold), and 5.1 pg/mL (same percentile as 10 pg/mL for the
contemporary assay) as cut-points. We proceeded the same way
for the super-sensitivity assay, using cut-points of 1.0 pg/mL
(median limit of detection) and 5.1 pg/mL (same percentile as
10 pg/mL for the contemporary assay). To describe the associ￾Neumann: Troponins and Future CVD Events

ation of troponin with clinical endpoints, Cox regression models
adjusting for the variables of the Framingham risk score (log￾transformed total cholesterol, log-transformed HDL, log-trans￾formed systolic blood pressure, hypertension medication, diabetes,
current smoking) and region of Finland (east, west) were
computed. We used the Framingham equation meant for
estimating the 10-year risk of cardiovascular event in primary
care [18]. In these analyses troponin concentrations were log￾transformed, and age was used as the time scale. Multiple
imputation techniques were used to manage missing values
[19,20]. The additional value of troponin concentration to the
Framingham risk score was assessed by means of the C-index,
integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) and net reclassifica￾tion improvement (NRI) with risk categories [0–5%), [5–10%),
[10–20%), and [20–100%] for 10-year risk [21,22]. The clinical
NRI refers to individuals with an intermediate 10-year risk (5–
20%) according to the Framingham Risk Score. Ten-fold cross￾validation was used to control for over-optimism. R version 15.1
(R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) was
used for all analyses. All tests were two-tailed and p,0.05 was
considered statistically significant. The results of the contempo￾rary-sensitivity troponin I assay in this study population have been
published before [19]. In comparison to the earlier publication we
now have 3 more years of follow-up with 232 more CVD events.
Furthermore, the modeling is slightly different: in the present
manuscript the included covariates are different, the troponin I

Results
Baseline characteristics of the study sample
The FINRISK 1997 study enrolled 7,899 individuals (50.3%
women and 49.7% men) after exclusion of those with prevalent
MACE and pregnant women (Table 1). The mean age of included
persons was 47.8 years. The mean baseline concentration of
troponin was 3.9 pg/mL when measured with the contemporary￾sensitivity assay, 3.0 pg/mL when measured with the high￾sensitivity assay, and 2.8 pg/mL when measured with the super￾sensitivity assay. Troponin values above the assay thresholds were
observed in 26.4% for the contemporary-sensitivity assay, in
81.5% for the high-sensitivity assay, and in 93.9% for the super￾sensitivity assay (Table 2). During the 14 years of follow-up 810
individuals died. All incident MACE accounted to 1,074, which
included 299 ischemic strokes, 770 CVD events, and 505 incident
heart failures. See Table 1 for further details of the baseline
characteristics.
Association of troponin concentration measured by
contemporary-sensitivity, high-sensitivity, and super￾sensitivity assay with cardiovascular outcome
Figure 1 presents Kaplan- Meier estimates for MACE and HF,
adjusted for age and sex, showing higher survival rates for the
lowest troponin category of the supersensitive assay. In the Cox
regression model, hazard ratios of the high-sensitivity and the
super-sensitivity assays were significantly increased for incident
MACE 1.12 [95% CI 1.05–1.19] and 1.18 [1.11–1.25], MI 1.17
[1.04–1.30] and 1.24 [1.11–1.39], and HF 1.19 [1.1–1.3] and 1.28
[1.18–1.39] for continuous values per 1-SD increase (Table 3 and
Fig. 2). For strokes, only troponin assessed by the super-sensitive
assay showed a significantly increased HR 1.14 [1.01–1.28]. No
association was seen with all-cause death. Comparing the gender￾specific HR, we observed similar values in both sexes (Table S1 in
file S1). Both, C-reactive protein (CRP) and NT-proBNP, are well￾established biomarkers for cardiovascular risk prediction. To
control for these variables, we performed an additional adjustment
for CRP and NT-proBNP. In this analysis HRs became weaker
using the super-sensitivity assay, but were still significant: for
MACE 1.11 [1.04–1.19], CVD 1.1 [1.02–1.19], MI 1.19 [CI
1.05–1.34], and HF 1.18 [1.08–1.29] (Table S3 in file S1). Troponin
assessed by the high-sensitivity assay showed a significantly
increased HR for MI 1.12 [CI 1.0–1.26], and HF 1.11 [1.01–
1.21]. When considering categorical values, HRs were generally
higher for the highest troponin category than the lowest, but a
significantly increased HR was observed only for HF (high￾sensitivity and super-sensitivity assay) and MACE (super-sensitivity
assay) (Table S2 in file S1). The use of the contemporary-sensitivity
and super-sensitivity troponin assays improved the discrimination
beyond the Framingham Risk Model for CVD and MI (Table S3 in
file S1). Troponin measurement using the high-sensitivity and
super-sensitivity troponin assays improved discrimination for
MACE and HF, while no significant improvement was seen for
stroke and death.
Risk reclassification by determination of baseline
troponin concentration
Net reclassification for the different events did not improve in
the overall analysis (Table 4). Focusing on individuals with an
intermediate 10-year risk (5–20%) according to the Framingham
Risk Score, we determined the clinical NRI. The strongest clinical
NRI for incident CVD was achieved with inclusion of troponin
measured with the super-sensitivity assay followed by the troponin
measured with the contemporary-sensitivity assay (3.46%,
p = 0.009 and 2.30%, p = 0.026). Considering HF and MACE
we observed a significantly improved reclassification (HF 10.23%,
p,0.001; MACE 5.1%, p,0.001), when using the super￾sensitivity troponin assay.

Discussion
The use of more sensitive troponin assays has revealed a high
potential for diagnosis of acute cardiac events, but also for
identifying individuals at risk of a future cardiovascular event. This
study compared the predictive power of baseline troponin
concentrations in a population-based setting using three troponin
assays of different sensitivity, ranging from a contemporary￾sensitivity and high-sensitivity to a super-sensitivity assay, in
individuals without a history of MACE. We observed a generally
stronger association of troponin concentrations with MACE, CVD,
MI, HF, and stroke, when the super-sensitivity assay was used
compared to the high-sensitivity and contemporary-sensitivity
assays. The associations remained significant after adjustment for
the classical risk factors included in the Framingham equation, and
additional adjustment for CRP and NT-proBNP for the endpoints
MACE, CVD, MI, and HF. Net reclassification improvement was
not significant among all subjects. In subjects with intermediate risk,
however, reclassification was significantly improved for various
endpoints. The strongest clinical reclassification improvement was
found with the super-sensitivity troponin assay for MACE and HF.
Previous studies have shown that troponin predicts cardiovas￾cular events in the general population [8]. In the Dallas Heart
Study, troponin T was detectable with a high-sensitivity assay in
25% of the general population and significantly associated with
structural heart disease and mortality [8]. In older patients of the
Cardiovascular Health Study, troponin T was measured by a high￾sensitivity assay with a detection rate of 66%. Detectable troponin
T concentrations were associated with incident HF and cardio￾vascular death [23]. In the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities
Study high-sensitivity assayed troponin T was also measurable in
66% of the study population and associated with CHD, mortality,
and HF [24]. In contrast to these findings, detection rates in the
present study were higher, since troponin I measured by the high￾Figure 2. Hazard Ratios from Cox Regression Models for Baseline Troponin Assessed by Contemporary-Sensitivity, High-Sensitivity

sensitivity and super-sensitivity assay was above the assay threshold
in 82% and in 94% of individuals, respectively. In a recently
published overview on 19 different troponin assays, the same high￾sensitivity and super-sensitivity troponin I assays were used and
showed even higher detection rates (96% and 100%, respectively)
when using newer assays with lower LODs [25]. The same super￾sensitivity assay was used in the Minnesota Heart Survey and
showed a significant association with cardiovascular death [13].
These results are confirmed by our current findings with much
larger material, and extended to include non-fatal endpoints. The
troponin overview by Apple showed important differences in the
99th percentile according to gender with mostly higher concen￾trations in males. In our study median troponin concentrations
measured by either the high-sensitivity or the super-sensitivity
assay were higher in males. The measured HRs however did not
differ significantly. Nevertheless gender-specific analysis should be
considered for the interpretation of absolute troponin concentra￾tions. Furthermore, recent results from the Scottish Heart Health
Extended Cohort study suggested that the optimal (in terms of
sensitivity and specificity) cutpoints of high-sensitivity troponin I
differed between men and women [26]. The supersensitive
troponin I was, however, not determined in the Scottish study.
With the super-sensitivity troponin assay it is possible to measure
very low troponin concentrations, reflecting minor myocardial
processes without major ischemic damage. Therefore the use of
super-sensitivity troponin assays apparently enables an improve￾ment of risk prediction in the general population, whereas its
superiority in settings of acute coronary syndrome diagnosis needs
to be further elucidated.
A particular strength of the present study is the comparison of
three troponin assays with different sensitivities in risk prediction.
However, various limitations merit consideration. First, measure￾ments have been performed in frozen samples that were stored for
14 years at 270uC and had been thawed twice. Second – and
most important – we do not have sufficient data at the moment to
fully understand the clinical consequences of reclassification in
those individuals reclassified from the intermediate risk group to
the high-risk group. A recent report suggested medical interven￾tion with statin therapy after such reclassification obtained using
measurements of fibrinogen or CRP [27]. That paper demon￾strated the potential of the approach but the reclassification with
CRP or fibrinogen was relatively modest. The present study and
our earlier work suggest that better reclassification can be obtained
with troponin or by combining troponin with other biomarkers
into a biomarker score [19]. It seems, however, that a randomized
clinical trial would be needed to unequivocally demonstrate the
benefits and risks of this approach. In contrast to our earlier work
the contemporary-sensitivity assay was not able to predict outcome
in the present study [19]. This is explained by the longer follow-up
period, the larger number of CVD events and somewhat different
modelling strategy. Nevertheless, the HRs of our earlier study and
the present study are close to each other and the 95% CIs are
widely overlapping. Finally, this study is limited to the Finnish
population. Therefore, regional and especially ethnic differences of
the measured biomarkers might have been missed.
Conclusion
Using a super-sensitivity assay, troponin I was detectable in
almost all healthy individuals in this population-based setting. In
terms of relative risk, troponin I was a significant predictor for
future CVD events over and above the standard Framingham
equation and remained significant even after further adjustment
for CRP and NT-proBNP. In subjects at intermediate risk of
CVD, the super-sensitivity troponin assay significantly improved
reclassification for HF and MACE outcomes. Although both, the
super-sensitivity and the high-sensitivity assays are predictors for
incident CVD, application of the super-sensitivity assay might hold
a slightly higher potential to reclassify the outcome.
