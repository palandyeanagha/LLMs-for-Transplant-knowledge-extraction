Abstract
Onchocerciasis, caused by the filarial nematode Onchocerca volvulus, is a parasitic disease leading to debilitating skin
disease and blindness, with major economic and social consequences. The pathology of onchocerciasis is principally
considered to be a consequence of long-standing host inflammatory responses. In onchocerciasis a subcutaneous nodule is
formed around the female worms, the core of which is a dense infiltrate of inflammatory cells in which microfilariae are
released. It has been established that the formation of nodules is associated with angiogenesis. In this study, we show using
specific markers of endothelium (CD31) and lymphatic endothelial cells (Lyve-1, Podoplanin) that not only angiogenesis but
also lymphangiogenesis occurs within the nodule. 7% of the microfilariae could be found within the lymphatics, but none
within blood vessels in these nodules, suggesting a possible route of migration for the larvae. The neovascularisation was
associated with a particular pattern of angio/lymphangiogenic factors in nodules of onchocerciasis patients, characterized
by the expression of CXCL12, CXCR4, VEGF-C, Angiopoietin-1 and Angiopoietin-2. Interestingly, a proportion of
macrophages were found to be positive for Lyve-1 and some were integrated into the endothelium of the lymphatic
vessels, revealing their plasticity in the nodular micro-environment. These results indicate that lymphatic as well as blood
vascularization is induced around O. volvulus worms, either by the parasite itself, e.g. by the release of angiogenic and
lymphangiogenic factors, or by consecutive host immune responses.

Introduction
Onchocerciasis is caused by the filarial nematode Onchocerca
volvulus. This disease is an important cause of visual impairment in
African countries. Once the infective larvae penetrate into the skin
during a blood meal of black fly vectors (Simulium spp.) they
develop into male and female adult worms, residing in
subcutaneous nodules (onchocercomas) and producing large
numbers of microfilariae. In these nodules adult females can
reach 70 cm in length. Although males can be observed alongside
females within nodules, they are never identified alone in
onchocercomas. This is also observed in cattle onchocercomas
[1,2] suggesting that nodules are induced by female filariae [3]. A
particularity of onchocerciasis is the localisation of microfilariae in
the dermis and not in the blood, unlike many other filarial species.
Besides the skin, microfilariae are also able to migrate into the eye,
where they can induce serious lesions.
The majority of infected individuals has a hyporeactive form of
the disease (generalized onchocerciasis), characterised by a mixed
T helper type (Th) 1, Th2 and T regulator (Tr) 1 response,
induced by the filarial as well as Wolbachia bacteria [4]. These
endosymbionts are able to induce a pro-inflammatory Th1
response recruiting neutrophils and activating macrophages,
counterbalancing the filarial induced Th2 response [5,6,7,8].
Macrophages are the predominant cell type in the nodule and
have a regulatory role in antigenic stimulation [9,10]. They also
act on microfilariae fitness as those with morphological alterations
or microfilariae after ivermectin treatment were nearly always
surrounded by adherent macrophages [11,12,13]. Epithelioid cells
and giant cells can be found near the worms. Other cells in the
nodule include lymphocytes, polymorphonuclear neutrophils,
eosinophils, plasma cells, and mast cells [12,14,15,16]. The core
of the nodule is limited by a fibrous outer layer which is attached
to the skin, deep fasciae, bones or joints [17]. As in solid tumours,
there is evidence that the extent of nodule formation is associated
with new blood vascularisation [18,19] which enables infiltration
of host immune cells but could also supply nutrients to the worms.
Microfilariae are released by female worms in the inflammatory
core of the nodule from where they can migrate long distances
through the body of Onchocerca patients [20,21]. In cervids infected

with Onchocerca species microfilariae accumulated in the ears
whereas the adult worms were present in the legs [22]. A role for
the lymphatic system in microfilariae migration processes has been
suggested [23,24] but, to date, lymphangiogenesis in the nodule
and dissemination of microfilariae from these vessels have not
been investigated, due to technical limitations, such as the more
recent development of specific markers.
Using specific antibodies we could confirm the presence of blood
and lymphatic vessels in onchocercomas. Both of them were largely
distributed within the nodules and present in close proximity to the
worms. Almost 7% of microfilariae were found within lymphatics of
the nodule, however they were not present in the lymphatics of the
skin. In addition, we identified the presence of angio/lymphangio￾genic factors needed for vessel formation in onchocercomas. These
were characterized by the gene expression of chemokine (C-X-C
motif) ligand 12 (CXCL12), chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 4
(CXCR4), vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGF-C),
Angiopoietin-1 and Angiopoietin-2 in the nodules of patients. A
striking finding in this study was the presence of macrophages
expressing the lymphatic endothelial cell marker Lyve-1 within the
lymphatic vessels of the nodules suggesting a contribution of
macrophages to the neovascularisation process and thus a new role
of these cells in onchocercoma development.
Knowledge of the induction and growth of nodules, especially of
the involvement of the vascular system in these processes and its
contribution to parasite fitness and survival, might be helpful for
identification of new drug targets against onchocerciasis. Even if
efforts are made to test new drugs against human O. volvulus and
bovine Onchocerca spp. (moxidectin and antibiotics targeting the
Wolbachia endosymbionts of the parasites), onchocerciasis control
relies presently on a single drug, ivermectin. In this context,
targeting angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis in onchocercomas
may provide new mechanisms either to supply chemotherapy in
closer contact to worms, or to prevent the expansion of the nodule
by blocking the entry of inflammatory cells through the destruction
of the blood system.
Results
Abundance of Lymphatic Vessels in Onchocercoma
Blood and lymphatic vessels were identified on thin consecutive
sections of O. volvulus nodules using monoclonal anti-CD31
antibody to detect endothelial cells (Figures 1A, 2B, 2E, 2H and
2K), and monoclonal anti- Lymphatic vessel endothelium receptor
1 (Lyve-1) (Figures 1B, 2D, 2G, 2J and 2M) or anti-Podoplanin
(Figures 2C, 2F, 2I and 2L) antibodies to discriminate lymphatic
endothelial cells. This revealed the presence of Lyve-1 and CD31
double positive lymphatic vessels as well as CD31 single positive
blood vessels (Figure 1A–D).
Vascular distribution within the different zones of the nodules
(Figure 2A) is summarised in Table 1. The vascularisation of the
nodule was more developed in the dense infiltrate area (zone C). A
comparison of the total number of vessels (CD31) with Lyve-1 and
podoplanin positive vessels clearly demonstrated a dense network of
lymphatics in addition to blood vessels. However, blood vessels were
more numerous than lymphatic vessels in all three areas (Table 1).
Podoplanin and Lyve-1 staining displayed similar results.
Nodules were divided into three zones according to Edgeworth
[16]. Zone A represents the outer fibrovascular capsule (Figure 2A).
Zone B corresponds to the inner adult worm bundle with
surrounding extracellular matrix interspersed with solitary cells
(Figure 2A). Zone C is characterized by a dense cellular infiltrate
surrounding and in contact with the adult worm (Figure 2A).
These two last zones constitute the core of the nodule.
In detail, the zone A mainly contained middle-size, rounded
CD31+ vessel sections; a few large- and small-size rounded vessel
sections were also observed as well as few long flattened sections
(Figure 2B). The zone B mostly contained middle- and large-size
rounded vessel sections; few small-size rounded and long flattened
vessel sections were also observed (Figure 2E). The zone C
contained predominantly small-size rounded and short flattened
vessel sections; few long flattened vessels were also seen in this dense
cellular infiltrated area (Figure 2H). CD31+ vessels were often found
close to the worm sections (Figure 2K). Blood vessels in the nodule
were positive for collagen type IV, showing the presence of a
basement membrane in these vessels (data not shown).
Regarding lymphatic vascularisation, the zone A mainly
contained large flattened Podoplanin+ and Lyve-1+ lymphatic
vessel sections and a few small-size rounded lymphatics (Figures 2C
and 2D). The zone B was more diverse with irregular shapes of
lymphatics ranging from middle-size rounded to long, flattened
vessel sections (Figures 2F and 2G). The zone C mostly contained
long to very long flattened sections (Figures 2I and 2J); few small￾size rounded lymphatic vessel sections were also observed.
Lymphatic vessels were observed often close to the worm sections
(Figures 2L and 2M).
Few Microfilariae Were Present within Lymphatic Vessels
of the Nodule but Not of the Dermis
Besides being part of inflammatory processes, these newly
formed lymphatics could be a pathway by which the microfilariae
migrate out of the nodule into the dermis of patients. Thus after a
specific staining of lymphatic vessels for Lyve-1 or podoplanin, we
analysed the nodules and the dermis for the presence of
microfilariae in the lumen of the lymphatic vessels.
Microfilariae were observed in all three zones but the majority was
found in the core of the nodules. They were never identified in blood
vessels. Some of them were present in close contact to the lymphatic
vessels (Figure 3A). The presence of microfilariae within lymphatics
was shown in the nodules presenting microfilariae (Figures 3B and
3C). The mean number of microfilariae per section of nodule was
41.5 ranging from 14 to 52. The percentage of microfilariae in the
lymphatic vessels was 6.6% ranging from 3.8% to 11.4%.

In the dermis, the mean number of microfilariae was 12.364.4
per section of skin snip (6100 magnification). Microfilariae were
often close to the initial lymphatics but their presence inside them
was not observed (Figure 4D). About 13% of microfilariae were
observed in perivascular spaces, around lymphatic vessels,
arterioles or nerve sections. Initial lymphatics were dilated
(lymphatic ectasia) (Figure 4A) and some contained large
mononuclear cells (Figure 4B); collapsed lymphatic vessels were
also observed (Figure 4C).
Onchocercomas Were Associated with a Molecular Profile
of Lymphangiogenic and Angiogenic Markers
Angiogenic and lymphangiogenic cytokines and their receptors
have been identified as key regulators of angiogenic and

lymphangiogenic processes. Thus to determine the markers
involved in vascularisation of onchocercoma, we analysed the
gene expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A,
VEGF-C, VEGF-D, VEGF-R1, VEGF-R2, VEGF-R3, CXCL12,
CXCR4, Angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1) and Angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2). The
members of the VEGF family and their receptors, the Ang-1 and
Ang-2, as well as the chemokine CXCL12 are central to the
activation and maintenance of a neovascularisation.
Among them we found different levels of expression of VEGF￾C, CXCL12, CXCR4, Ang-1, and Ang-2, with CXCL12 showing
the strongest expression. Only a weak but significant mRNA
expression of its unique receptor CXCR4 was measured. Elevated
transcripts of VEGF-C, Ang-1, and Ang-2 were also detected but
at a lower level than CXCL12 (Figure 5A). Other factors were not
detectable.
The high expression of CXCL12 was translated into protein as
we observed a strong staining for CXCL12 chemokine by cells in
the nodule (Figure 5B–D). CXCL12 was detected on connective
cells in the capsule (Figure 5B) and in the core of the nodule, on
endothelial cells of blood and lymphatic vessels (Figure 5C) and on
inflammatory cells (Figure 5D) in each of the analysed nodules.
Infiltrated Macrophages Expressed the Lymphatic
Endothelial Marker Lyve-1 and Were Associated with the
Lymphatic Vasculature
When staining onchocercomas for Lyve-1, we observed cells
other than endothelial cells, being positive for Lyve-1. They were
mononuclear and mainly localised in the capsular area (Figure 6A),
barely in the zone B. Some of them showed a phagocytic
phenotype (apoptotic neutrophils) suggesting that these cells could
be macrophages (Figure 6B). Double staining for Lyve-1 and
CD68, a known marker for macrophages in Onchocerca nodules,
demonstrated the presence of macrophages expressing a lymphatic
endothelial cell marker, Lyve-1, mainly in the capsule of the
nodule (Figures 6C, 6D, 6E, 6F, 6G, and 6H). In addition double
staining revealed the presence of Lyve-1+ macrophages in the
endothelium lining of the lymphatic vessels suggesting their
participation in neovascularisation (Figures 6I, 6J and 6K).
Discussion
This study provides evidences for the presence of lymphatic
vessels and pro-vascular factors within the human Onchocerca
nodule as well as of microfilariae within lymphatic capillary beds.
It further suggests that CD68+ macrophages expressing the
lymphatic endothelial marker Lyve-1 are recruited to the site of
lymphangiogenesis and these cells may participate to the vessel
formation in the nodule, as it has been shown in various
pathologies [54].
Only scattered information is known about the aetiology of
onchocercoma; worms which are found in nodules are adults and
the process of encapsulation of the female worms is unidentified.
Authors in the early 1900 [25,26] hypothesized that the O. volvulus
female worm was trapped in a skin lymphatic vessel which would
be not only the site of thrombosis but also the site of important
remodelling with intense inflammatory response, as analysed since
by several studies [12,16,27]. The female worm spends its lifespan
in the nodule and releases microfilariae into an inflammatory
environment. The general view is that nodules are highly
vascularised with both blood and lymphatic vessels. Blood
vascularisation was observed in onchocercomas [16,18,19].
However no data were available on a lymphatic network.
Imaging of lymphangiogenesis and angiogenesis requires robust
and unambiguous markers of lymphatic and blood vessels. In
recent years molecules specifically expressed on lymphatic and
blood vessels were identified. We have used Lyve-1 [28] and
Podoplanin [29] which are among the most useful markers for
microscopic imaging of lymphatic vessels and CD31, a marker
shared by lymphatic and blood vessels to analyse the presence of
the two vascular systems in Onchocerca nodules (Figure 1). Both
intensive blood and lymphatic vascularisation was established with
different shape and size of vessel sections according to the zones of
the nodule (Figure 2). In all cases, lymphatic vessels and worms
were in close proximity and many collapsed lymphatics were

found to surround the worm sections within the highly
inflammatory infiltrated cell environment (Figure 2). A small
proportion of microfilariae was observed within the lymphatic
vessels of the nodule (6.6%) suggesting a possible role of the
lymphatic system in the dissemination of O. volvulus microfilariae
out of the nodule to the other parts of the body. However no
microfilariae were found within the lymphatic vascular bed of the
dermis, although we observed vascular changes in the dermis:
some lymphatic vessels were dilated as evidenced by a well￾distended wall. Previously, authors underlined the presence of such

abnormal dilated capillary vessels and suggested a lymphatic
phenotype [23,30,31,32]. According to Bonucci et al. [23] some of
these vessels contained microfilariae, a finding which could explain
the dissemination of the parasite to other body areas. Observations
on the human and cattle Onchocerca species [24,33,34], as well as on
the experimental models of onchocerciasis e.g. Monanema martini in
rodents have suggested that the microfilariae could migrate
through the lymphatic system of the skin [35,36,37]. Indeed,
dermic microfilariae of Monanema martini in rodents and those of
Cercopithifilaria johnstoni in rats [38] were evidenced in the lymphatic
vessels of the skin and in deeper localisations [36,39]. In our hand,
we regularly observed microfilariae in close contact with the
lymphatic endothelial lining of the dermis, often in perivascular
spaces (Figure 4D) but not inside the lymphatic vessel. Our
findings do not exclude the possibility that microfilariae migrate
through the lymphatic system but it is likely that it may not be
their main pathway of migration.
The genesis of the blood and lymphatic vessels in the nodule
may be the consequences of two separate or additive phenomena:
first, neovascularisation could be induced by the worms them￾selves. Indeed, O. volvulus Activation associated Secreted Protein
(Ov-asp) was found to induce angiogenic responses when injected
into corneas of naive mice [40,41]; second, neovascularisation
could be induced by inflammation. There is increasing evidence
for close association between inflammation, the microenvironment
and tumour-associated neo-angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis.
Activated leukocytes in inflammatory sites produce a large number
of growth factors including FGF, VEGF, and PDGF family
members that might stimulate proliferation, migration and
survival of endothelial cells [42].
The molecular profile of angiogenic and lymphangiogenic
markers in nodules revealed a high expression of VEGF-C
(Figure 5A) a potent inductor of both blood and lymphatic
neovascularisation in tumor. VEGF-C is also found to be highly
upregulated in patients infected with Wuchereria bancrofti [43].
Angiopoietins-1 and -2 were also put in light as angiogenic and/or
lymphangiogenic markers in the nodules (Figure 5A). Indeed, the
angiopoietins and their receptor Tie2 play an important role in
vascular stabilization and pathologic neovascularization. Ang-1
activates Tie2 and functions as a positive regulator of remodeling
and stabilization of blood vessels. Recently, Ang-1 and Ang-2 have
been reported to regulate the formation of lymphatic vessels
through Tie2 [44].
An even higher expression was found for the chemokine
CXCL12 (Figure 5A) not only on mRNA level but also for the
protein (Figure 5B). Its receptor CXCR4 could also be detected,
however at a much lower mRNA (Figure 5A) and protein (data not
shown) level. Many chemokines have a proangiogenic activity
[45], in particular the ones signalling through CXCR1, CXCR2
and CXCR4 [46]. The CXCL12/CXCR4 couple is not only
known for its proangiogeneic activities [47] but it is also a key
element in endothelial cell recruitment to tumoral neovascular￾Figure 6. Lyve-1+ macrophages in nodule. (A) Individual Lyve-1+ mononuclear cells in the fibrous capsule of nodules. (B) Detail of a Lyve-1+

isation sites [48]. CXCL12 is hypothesised to exert its effect by
attracting CXCR4-expressing circulation-derived endothelial pre￾cursor cells to sites where they subsequently contribute to
neovascularisation. During this process, maturing cells lose
precursor specific markers and express the same cell surface
markers as mature endothelial cells involved in angiogenesis and
likely in lymphangiogenesis.
In this study we demonstrated the presence of macrophages
expressing the lymphatic endothelial marker Lyve-1 not only as
isolated cells within the fibrous capsule but also incorporated into
the new lymphatic vasculature within the core of the nodule
(Figure 6). Lyve-1 positive macrophages have been shown to be
essential for vessel formation in different pathological processes
[49,50,51,52,53]. Macrophages apparently play a dual role in
inflammation-induced lymphangiogenesis [54]: firstly they are
able to secrete lymphangiogenic growth factors VEGF-C and
VEGF-D that stimulate the growth of existing lymphatic
endothelial cells [55,56], and secondly they can trans-differentiate
into lymphatic endothelial cells that incorporate to the lymphatic
endothelium [57]. These macrophages expressing Lyve-1 also
underline the fact that no perfect lymphatic marker has been
found that works reliably in all species, tissues, vascular beds, and
in all physiological and pathologic conditions. It is likely that the
heterogeneity of expression of markers in lymphatic vessels reflects
differences in the phenotype of endothelial cells. The recruitment
of circulation-derived endothelial precursor cells [58] and/or the
appositional growth of lymphatics are known mechanisms that
contribute to lymphangiogenesis. However the role of macro￾phages should be considered, particularly in onchocercoma where
they represent a large proportion of infiltrated inflammatory cells.
In conclusion, it is clear that the vascular system is critical in the
modelling of the complex nodule microenvironment; the multi￾faceted axis CXCL12/CXCR4 and the growth factor VEGF-C
appear to be essential to these angiogenic and lymphangiogenic
processes. In lymphatic filariasis, doxycycline treatment decreases
the production of VEGF-C [43]. The question arises whether
doxycycline or other macrofilaricidal drugs affect lymphatic vessel
formation. All together new therapeutic options targeting the
neovascularisation processes deserve further investigation.
Materials and Methods
Patients, Onchocercomas and Skin Biopsies
Onchocercomas (n = 41) from patients in a hyper-endemic area
in Ghana were randomly selected for this investigation. Selection
criterion was presence of at least one fertile female within the
nodule. Full details including ethical approval have been
previously published [59]. The design of this randomized,
placebo-controlled double-blind study was approved by the
Committee on Human Research and Ethics of the School of
Medical Sciences of the Kumasi University of Science and
Technology (KNUST), Kumasi, Ghana as well as by the Ethics
Committee of the University of Liver-pool, which acted as a
control body since this work formed part of a European network
funded by the European Commission. The study conformed to the
principles of the Helsinki Declaration of 1974 (last amended 2004)
and to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) standards. The trial is
registered at Current Controlled Trials and has the registration
number ISRCTN 71141922. All patients provided written
informed consent for the collection of samples and subsequent
analysis.
The skin snips were from 8 patients of Mbarembeng, Moungo,
a region hyper-endemic for onchocerciasis, located in the Littoral
province of Cameroon. The design of this study was approved by
the National Ethics Committee, Yaounde´, Cameroon, as well as
by the Ethics Committee of the French ‘‘Agence Nationale pour la
Recherche’’. The study conformed to the principles of the Helsinki
Declaration of 1974 (last amended 2004) and to Good Clinical
Practice (GCP) standards. The trial is registered at National Ethics
Committee and has the registration number FWA IRB00001954.
Two skin snips (one from each iliac crest) from every patient were
made using a 2 mm Holth-type corneo-scleral punch. Parasito￾logical examination for O. volvulus was done by microscopic
examination for the presence of mf following incubation in 0.9%
NaCl at room temperature.
Immunohistochemical Staining for CD31, Lyve-1, and
Podoplanin
Onchocercomas and skin snips were directly cryo-preserved in
OCT compound at 280uC or were fixed in 10% buffered
formaldehyde and embedded into paraffin.
Five-micrometer sections were obtained from OCT embedded
tissues. Non-specific Ab binding was blocked by incubation in 20%
normal mouse or goat serum (DAKO). Serial sections were stained
for 60 minutes with mouse anti-human CD31 (DAKO) or goat
anti-human Lyve-1 (4 mg/ml, R&D systems) or their respective
IgG isotype control mAbs (R&D systems); donkey anti-mouse IgG
(H+L) Alexa Fluor 594 (InVitrogen) and rabbit F(ab9)2 anti-goat
IgG (H+L) FITC (Beckman Coulter) were used as secondary
antibodies. Sections were counterstained with a DAPI Solution.
Fluorescent microscope (Nikon) was used with the Envision
software.
CD31 and Podoplanin (0.2 mg/ml, AbD Serotec) were also
visualized with the EnVision+ Dual link system-HRP followed by
AEC+ substrate-chromogen system (DAKO). Lyve-1 was visual￾ized with the Vectastain kit followed by DAB substrate-chromogen
(Vector). Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin and
mounted for microscopy.
Lyve-1 staining was also performed on five-micrometer sections
from paraffin embedded tissues. Tissues were cut, deparaffinized,
and rehydrated through graded alcohols. Antigen retrieval was
performed by heating the slides for 20 minutes in a pH 6 citrate
buffer at 98uC. Endogenous peroxidase was quenched for 10
minutes with peroxidase blocking reagent (DAKO). The above
protocol was used for the antibody staining and its visualization.
Hematoxylin-eosin staining was also performed to reveal
general organisation of onchocercomas.
Vascular Organisation of the Nodule
The nodules were divided in 3 areas according to Edgeworth
[16]. Zone A represented the outer fibrovascular capsule. An inner
area is composed of spaced infiltrated cells (Zone B) and dense
cellular infiltrate (zone C) surrounding the worm (Figure 1A).
Immunostaining density of the CD31+
, Podoplanin+ or Lyve-1+
vessels (0, no vessel section; +, 1 to 4 vessel sections; ++, 5 to 19
vessel sections; +++, 20 to 49 vessel sections; ++++, more than 50
vessel sections) was evaluated by light microscopy (x20 objective).
Vessel sections were described as rounded (small, middle or large￾size) when lumen was present, or flattened (short or long) when
lumen was almost absent to totally absent.
Identification of Microfilariae within the Lymphatic
Vessels
Microfilariae were visualized by hematoxylin counterstaining
and their presence within lymphatic vessels was analysed on Lyve￾1+ sections from onchocercomas and skin snips. Microfilariae were
numerated on whole Lyve-1+ sections from nodule with high

magnification (x50). Microfilariae sections close together were
considered as one microfilaria. Percentage of microfilariae within
lymphatics was reported.
Double Immunofluorescence for Lyve-1/CD68
Non-specific Ab binding was blocked by incubation in 20%
normal donkey serum (DAKO, France). A Lyve-1/CD68
immunofluorescence double stain of nodule cryo-sections was
performed. An antibody directed against Lyve-1 (4 mg/ml, R&D
systems) was applied for 60 minutes to the sections. FITC Donkey
anti-Goat IgG (1.5 mg/ml, Jackson IR) was used to visualize
binding of the first antibody. Non-specific Ab binding was blocked
by incubation in 20% normal goat serum (DAKO, France). The
sections were then incubated for 60 minutes with a monoclonal
antibody against CD68 (DAKO). TRITC Goat anti-mouse IgG
(1:100, Nordic Immunology) was used to visualize binding of this
second antibody. Hoechst (4 mg/ml, Sigma) was used to stain the
nuclei. Fluorescent microscope (Nikon) was used with ACT-1C
software.
Immunofluorescence Staining for CXCL12 and CXCR4
Non-specific Ab binding was blocked by incubation in 20%
normal goat serum (DAKO, France). The sections were stained for
60 minutes with mouse anti-human CXCL12 mAb (clone 79018)
or mouse anti-human CXCR4 (clone 12G5) or their mouse IgG
isotype control mAbs obtained from R&D systems; mAb F(ab9)2
fragment goat anti mouse IgG (H+L) FITC was used as a
secondary antibody. Fluorescent microscope (Nikon) was used
with Envision system.
Nodule RNA Extraction, cDNA Synthesis and Real-Time
qPCR for Vascular Markers
Total RNA was extracted from 33 nodules. The cDNA was
generated by reverse transcription using Omniscript-RT kit
(Qiagen) and random primers in a 20 ml reaction containing
1 mg of total RNA, which was pretreated with RNase-free DNase I
(Qiagen, CA) to eliminate contaminating genomic DNA.
Real-time PCR was performed on Rotorgene 6000 (Corbett
Research). qPCR was performed in 10 ml consisting of 1 ml PCR
buffer, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 0.1 ml Sybr Green I (1:1000 in DMSO,
Roche), 0.25 U Hotstar Taq polymerase (Qiagen) and 2 ml cDNA
template. Primers used in qPCR (VEGF-A, VEGF-C, VEGF-D,
VEGF-R1, VEGF-R2, VEGF-R3, CXCL12, CXCR-4, Angio￾poietin 1, Angiopoietin 2) are listed in Table S1. Gene expression
levels were calculated relative to the house-keeping gene b-actin.
Data were analyzed using Prism version 4.0 (GraphPad) and
presented as mean 6 SEM.
