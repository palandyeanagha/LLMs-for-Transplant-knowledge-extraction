Liver transplantation is the accepted treatment for patients
with acute liver failure and liver-based metabolic disorders.
However, donor organ shortage and lifelong need for
immunosuppression are the main limitations to liver trans￾plantation. In addition, loss of the native liver as a target organ
for future gene therapy for metabolic disorders limits the
futuristic treatment options, resulting in the need for
alternative therapeutic strategies. A potential alternative to
liver transplantation is allogeneic hepatocyte transplantation.
Over the last two decades, hepatocyte transplantation has
made the transition from bench to bedside. Standardized
techniques have been established for isolation, culture, and
cryopreservation of human hepatocytes. Clinical hepatocyte
transplantation safety and short-term efficacy have been
proven; however, some major hurdles—mainly concerning
shortage of donor organs, low cell engraftment, and lack of a
long-lasting effect—need to be overcome to widen its clinical
applications. Current research is aimed at addressing these
problems, with the ultimate goal of increasing hepatocyte
transplantation efficacy in clinical applications.
Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is currently
considered the gold standard treatment for end-stage
liver disease, acute liver failure, and liver-based metabolic
disorders, and is the only intervention with proven clinical
benefits and long-lasting effects. However, the shortage of
donors limits the number of patients who may benefit from
OLT and means that there is a significant waiting list and high
mortality. OLT has several disadvantages, including the risks
of complications related to surgery, the high cost of the
procedure, and the need for lifelong immunosuppression.
Theoretically, a potential alternative to liver transplantation is
hepatocyte transplantation (HT), in which transplanted cells
provide the missing/impaired hepatic function once engrafted
into the recipient’s liver. Mature hepatocytes are considered
the most obvious cell type for liver cell transplantation since
they are the major functional components of the liver. In
principle, hepatocyte transplantation has several advantages
over OLT: (i) it is less invasive and less expensive not
involving a complex surgery; (ii) it can be performed
repeatedly if required; (iii) cryopreserved cells isolated from
donor livers are available immediately when needed; (iv)
native liver remains in place serving as a backup in case of cell
graft failure and allowing potential regeneration in patients
with acute liver failure (ALF), as well as representing a
possible target for future gene therapy in patients with liver￾based metabolic disorders; and (v) because this procedure
only requires a fraction of the cells isolated from a donor
organ, multiple patients can be treated from one donor tissue,
thus saving other organs for patients who do require OLT.
The first experimental attempt of hepatocyte transplanta￾tion was developed in 1976 (1) to treat the hyperbilirubinemic
Gunn rat, an animal model for Crigler–Najjar syndrome type
I (CN), and along with other preclinical observations (2–4), it
led to the first transplant of autologous hepatocytes in 10
patients with liver cirrhosis in 1992 in Japan with uncertain
results (5). Since then, reports have been published of more
than 100 patients with liver disease treated by HT worldwide
(6). To date, human hepatocytes transplantation has resulted
in partial correction of a high number of liver diseases
including urea cycle disorders (7–9), factor VII deficiency
(10), glycogen storage disease type 1 (11), infantile Refsum’s
disease (12), phenylketonuria (13), severe infantile oxalosis
(14), and acute liver failure (15–18) (Table 1). The level of cell
replacement required to achieve physiological benefit varies
depending on the disease, and it has been considered around
5 − 10% of theoretical liver mass in the transplantations carried
out so far. Although encouraging clinical improvements are
seen in patients transplanted with allogeneic hepatocytes, long￾term efficacy is still hampered by insufficient engraftment/
long-term acceptance of cellular allografts, despite immuno￾suppression (19). Even though promising, HT still faces
limitations. First, there is a limited supply of donor livers from
which high-quality hepatocytes can be isolated, as the source is
suboptimal livers that are otherwise unsuitable for organ
transplantation (20). These cells are often poorly functioning.
Second, cryopreservation of hepatocytes results in impaired cell
viability after thawing due to freeze–thaw damage (21). Third,
cell engraftment is quite poor, estimated to be from 0.1 to 0.3%

of host liver mass in mice after infusion of 3 − 5% of the total
recipient liver cells (22). Finally, allogeneic rejection is most
probably the main cause for the observed decline of cell graft
function within 1 year of HT (19). Although the safety of
clinical HT has been very well established, therapeutic benefit
has been modest and only temporary so far. This is partially in
contrast with very convincing preclinical results obtained in a
number of animal models of liver disease (2–4), possibly
because these models do not properly mimic the disease in
humans. Animals usually develop liver injury within a few days
or weeks, whereas in humans the injury is significantly more
severe occurring over many decades, thus highlighting a need
of more realistic models of liver disease.
PROCEDURES: HEPATOCYTE SOURCE, ISOLATION, QUALITY
CONTROL, AND ADMINISTRATION FOR CELL
TRANSPLANTATION
Human hepatocytes are isolated from (i) whole donor livers
unsuitable/rejected for OLT, mostly because of severe
steatosis, prolonged ischemia time, older, or non-heart￾beating donors, or (ii) from liver segments, mainly I and
IV, which are available for cell isolation after split liver
transplantation. Alternatively, fetal and neonatal livers are
being explored as a potential cell source (23,24) as they are
currently not considered for OLT and may allow the isolation
of very high-quality cells (9). Neonatal-derived hepatocytes,
although not fully mature, show activity of some of the main
enzymes responsible for hepatic-detoxifying functions (23).
Explanted livers from patients with liver-based metabolic
disorders have also been considered as a potential source of
cells. This concept was adopted from a similar approach used
in the so-called “domino” liver transplantation performed
since the mid-1990s, in which a liver transplant recipient with
a known metabolic defect can donate his explanted native
liver for use as liver graft in another patient (25). In a similar
way, liver explants from patients with defined metabolic
disorders could become a source of hepatocytes, since their
missing enzymatic function would be performed by the
recipient’s native liver, left in place. This approach was used in
a 6-year-old boy with severe phenylketonuria transplanted
with hepatocytes isolated from a glycogen storage type 1b
liver explant, with significant reduction of blood phenylala￾nine levels up to 3 months after transplantation (13).
In order to isolate the hepatocytes, a standardized three-step
collagenase perfusion technique originally developed by Berry
and Friend and later modified (26–28) is used. First, major
hepatic vessels are cannulated and perfused with Hank’s buffered
salt solution (HBSS) containing EGTA, which is able to chelate
calcium ions, thus disrupting the desmosomes, calcium￾dependent cell-to-cell adhesions. Second, the liver is flushed
with plain HBSS to remove any residue of EGTA. Third, the
tissue is perfused with a calcium-dependent collagenase solution
to digest the extracellular matrix. After breaking of the liver
capsule, the released liver cells are filtered and centrifuged at low
speed to separate hepatocytes from nonparenchymal cells.
Hepatocytes can be used fresh for transplantation or cryopre￾served. Several protocols have been described to cryopreserve
human hepatocytes, with the best results being achieved
cryopreserving 106
–107 cells/ml in the University of Wisconsin
organ preservation solution containing 10% dimethyl sulfoxide
and 5% glucose, and using a controlled-rate freezer (29).
Cryopreserved hepatocytes are then stored at –140 °C until
required for HT. Hepatocyte isolations for use in clinical HT
must be performed under good manufacturing practice (GMP)
in an aseptic and accredited units.
Evaluation of hepatocyte quality before transplantation is
vital, especially on cryopreserved cells, as it has been shown
that freeze-thawing cycles damage mitochondria, affect cell
respiration with a dramatic drop of ATP levels (21), and may
induce apoptosis (unpublished data). Most centers use trypan
blue exclusion test as the main and often only criterion to
assess cell quality before transplantation, usually accepting
cells with viability equal or higher than 60% for clinical
applications. However, viability assessment does not detect
any sign of early apoptosis in the cells or their functions,
which should probably be included in the cell quality control
to ensure that high-quality hepatocytes are transplanted (30).
In keeping with GMP standards, microbiological analysis
must be undertaken at each stage of cell preparation and the
final product must be exempt from any contamination before
release of hepatocytes for cell transplantation.
The most widely used administration route for clinical delivery
of HT is intraportal infusion, with the catheter placed in the
portal vein or in one of its branches. In newborn babies, the
portal vein can be accessed by catheterization of the umbilical

vein. In older children, a cut-down approach may be used or a
laparoscopic/mini laparotomy insertion of a central venous
cannula into a tributory of the portal vein. Hepatocytes
(~20 − 40 μM in diameter) move across the sinusoidal vessels
and induce transient occlusions in the periportal vascular areas
dependent on cell size, followed by restoration of normal blood
flow by vascular permeabilization, which allows transplanted
cells to reach the liver parenchyma (31,32). Hepatocytes
remaining in the portal vessels are cleared by macrophages
within 24 h. The number of cells injected is limited by portal
pressure, which should be monitored throughout by Doppler
ultrasound, and should not exceed 12 mm Hg to avoid the risk
of portal hypertension (33). Cell dose and infusion rate depend
on the patient weight and clinical situation, with the aim of
injecting around 5% of the total liver mass. Most centers
consider a dose of 2 × 108 cells per kg of body weight as the
upper safe limit for hepatocyte transplantation. In some
situations when a high number of cells is needed to ensure
clinical benefits, multiple infusions can be performed. Intras￾plenic administration has been suggested as an alternative to
intraportal injection in patients with liver cirrhosis, in whom
altered liver architecture impacts hepatocyte engraftment (34).
The peritoneal cavity represents an attractive administration
route as it is easily accessible and may contain a large number of
cells. For these reasons, it has been used in patients with acute
liver failure (15,17). However, lack of anchorage for the
transplanted cells and host immune response result in a rapid
decline in transplanted cell viability. A way to overcome this
problem is the encapsulation of hepatocytes in alginate
microbeads so that immune cells cannot reach them, thus
prolonging their survival (35).
INDICATIONS
Hepatocyte transplantation has been used clinically both in
congenital metabolic disorders affecting the liver and acute
liver failure (Table 1). The most encouraging outcomes have
been shown in liver-based metabolic disorder, where the
number of cells needed to compensate for a single gene defect
is lower than that for acute liver failure.
Inborn Errors of Liver Metabolism
Urea cycle defects represent the most common liver-based
metabolic disorders treated with hepatocyte transplantation. These
diseases are characterized by an incapacity of fully converting
ammonia into urea, with hyperammonemic crisis, frequently
leading to death. To date, hepatocyte transplantation has been
used in different types of urea cycle defects, including ornithine
transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency (7,36–40), argininosuccinate
lyase (ASL) deficiency (8), citrullinemia (7), and carbamoylpho￾sphate synthetase (CPS) deficiency (7,40). Although most patients
showed clinical benefits, the effects were not maintained over the
long term. Soltys et al. recently published findings from two
patients with urea cycle defects, who underwent hepatocyte
transplantation after preconditioning with irradiation. The two
patients, a 4-month-old girl with CPS1 deficiency and a 7-month￾old child with OTC deficiency, received 1.25 and 2.0 × 108 viable
hepatocytes/kg body weight, respectively. Clinical benefits were
seen in the patient with OTC deficiency, however, after around
40 days, the child developed frequent hyperammonemia. Both
children received an OLT after a few months (40).
Crigler–Najjar syndrome is due to a defective UDP￾glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzyme determining increased
serum-unconjugated bilirubin levels, which can lead to severe
brain damage and death. Current treatments include liver
transplantation and phototherapy. There are reports of patients
who have received up to 7.5 billion hepatocytes, showing up to
50% reduction in bilirubin and increase in UGT activity. The
majority of these patients received an OLT within a year. One
patient was transplanted 4 years later (41–43).
Glycogen storage disease type I is due to mutations impairing
the activity of glucose-6-phosphatase complex, with abnormal
accumulation of glycogen and fat in the liver and kidneys.
Hepatocyte transplantation was used in two adults with
improved glucose control up to 7 − 9 months (11,44).
Other liver-based metabolic diseases shown to improve
following hepatocyte transplantation include factor VII (fVII)
deficiency, where there was a 70% reduction in the need for
recombinant fVII for 6 months (10), and familial hyperch￾olesterolemia, where autologous ex vivo-corrected hepatocytes
were transplanted with not significant clinical improvement,
probably due to low efficiency of genetic correction (45). In
addition, hepatocyte transplantation has been used to treat
patients with alpha1-antitrypsin (34), infantile Refsum’s
disease (12), primary oxalosis (14), and phenylketonuria
(13,40). Safety of the method was confirmed in all these
treatments, however, similarly to the other diseases treated,
efficacy was not maintained over the long term.
Acute Liver Failure
Hepatocyte transplantation aims to bridge patients with acute
liver failure to recovery through regeneration of their own
liver or to OLT in case an organ becomes available. Cell
number necessary to provide hepatic function able to replace
the injured liver is slightly higher than for metabolic
disorders, estimated to be ~ 10 − 15% of liver cell mass (46).
Cell transplantation through the portal system is not always
possible in these patients, due to frequent coagulopathy issues;
therefore, other administration routes have been used, such as
intraperitoneally (15,17) or intrasplenic (16,34).
In many cases, hepatocyte transplantation in patients with
fulminant liver failure resulted in clinical improvements with
reduction in ammonia and bilirubin and hepatic encephalo￾pathy, as already extensively described in other reviews
(34,47). However, it is difficult to conclude about the efficacy
of this approach without randomized controlled trials.
IMMUNOSUPPRESSION AND IMMUNE RESPONSE TO CELL
GRAFT
There is no consensus regarding the optimum immunosup￾pressive treatment following HT. Most centers have adapted
immunosuppressive protocol used for orthotopic liver
transplantation to HT. Common immunosuppressive

regimens include induction with steroids and calcineurin
inhibitors (tacrolimus or cyclosporine) (8,10,11,42). Some
centers have also included therapy with anti-interleukine-2
receptor antibodies (basiliximab) (7). Experiences with OLT
have highlighted that liver is an immune-privileged organ,
leading in some cases to graft tolerance development and
possibility of immunosuppression withdrawal. Hepatocyte
transplantation has been erroneously considered similar to
liver transplantation in terms of immunogenicity and it was
initially assumed that hepatocytes would have the same
immune privilege as the whole liver. Unfortunately, allogeneic
hepatocytes seem to be highly antigenic in vivo unlike the liver
(20). This discrepancy between inherent tolerogenicity of
whole-liver and isolated hepatocytes may suggest that either
other hepatic cells like stellate cells or liver sinusoid
endothelial cells contribute to liver tolerance (48) or that
hepatocytes lose their tolerogenic potential in an allogeneic
environment (49). Rejection of hepatocytes is mediated by
both the innate and adoptive immunity, and detailed
elucidation of the mechanisms involved will probably
improve HT outcome.
The innate immune system plays a critical role after HT, as
it has been demonstrated that up to 70% of transplanted
hepatocytes might be eliminated by early phagocytic immune
response, without significant differences between allogeneic
and syngeneic cell transplantation (50). Different mechanisms
seem to be involved in hepatocyte early rejection. First, part of
the transplanted cells undergo cytolysis mediated by granu￾locytes and monocytes activated by surface adhesion proteins
expressed on hepatocyte cell membrane, like cadherins,
otherwise hidden and inaccessible to them in case of whole￾liver transplantation (51). Second, a process first described in
islet transplantation and known as “instant blood-mediated
inflammatory reaction” (IBMIR) is partly responsible for cell
loss. The IBMIR is initiated by tissue factor expressed on
hepatocyte cell membrane and is characterized by activation
of the coagulation and complement systems, binding of
activated platelets to hepatocyte surfaces with formation of
clots, and infiltration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes
resulting in the loss of transplanted cells (52,53).
In addition to the innate immune response, hepatocytes are
also rejected by the adaptive immune system. It has been
shown that injecting hepatocytes in T-cell-deficient mice
improved cell graft survival, not observed in case of
B-deficient, or selectively CD4+ or CD8+ T-cell-deficient
mice, suggesting that immunologic rejection of allogeneic
hepatocytes is mediated primarily by T cells (54). More recent
studies showed a lack of donor-specific antibodies, confirming
that humoral B-cell-mediated response may be not involved
in hepatocyte rejection (38).
IMPROVEMENT IN ENGRAFTMENT/PROLIFERATION OF
TRANSPLANTED CELLS
The outcome of HT is strictly dependent on the level of
engraftment of transplanted hepatocytes into the recipient’s
liver (Figure 1). This concept applies both to acute liver
failure and liver-based metabolic diseases. In case of metabolic
disorders, the ultimate goal is to achieve a long-lasting level of
cell integration allowing a stable expression of the missing
protein/enzyme over time. Several strategies have been
investigated to increase engraftment and/or proliferation of
transplanted hepatocytes. There has been much interest in
using the therapy in certain diseases that provide a natural
selective advantage for transplanted cells, such as hereditary
tyrosinemia type I (55), alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency (56),
and Wilson’s disease (57). Unfortunately, most liver diseases
do not offer a selective advantage to transplanted cells, thus
making necessary the development of new strategies to
achieve this aim, including genetic modification of donor cells
or induced injury to the recipient’s liver.
A study aiming to enhance the proliferation capacity of
donor hepatocytes before transplantation showed that
transfecting freshly isolated murine hepatocytes ex vivo with
the nonviral sleeping beauty (SB) transposon vector carrying
FoxM1 gene, a known cell-cycle regulator, significantly
improved liver repopulation without inducing tumorigenesis
(58). Many attempts have been made to precondition the
recipient’s liver and give a selective advantage to the
transplanted cells, mainly partial hepatectomy (59), portal
embolization (60), and liver irradiation (40), as suggested by a
consensus meeting held in London in 2009, where the main
representatives of the active clinical hepatocyte transplant
programs identified the main limitations of HT and suggested
solutions to overcome them (61).
Partial hepatectomy has been successfully used in several
animal models of liver disease and showed significant liver
repopulation (62,63). Despite its clinical safety being reported
more than two decades ago (45), there are still some doubts
about its efficacy in humans. Recently, two patients with
Crigler–Najjar syndrome type I underwent partial hepatect￾omy followed by hepatocyte transplantation. Even though cell
graft function was lost in one patient for discontinuation of
immunosuppression, the other patient showed a decrease of
bilirubin to ≈50% of pretransplant concentrations for more
than 6 months. However, he finally underwent liver
transplantation since graft functions were completely lost
~ 600 days after HT (59).
Another approach to improve donor hepatocyte engraft￾ment is partial embolization of the portal vein. This procedure
is routinely used in patients undergoing liver resection in case
the remaining liver is too small to ensure hepatic function
(64). Portal vein embolization (PVE) is safe, well tolerated by
patients, and induces hypertrophy of nonembolized liver
lobes. Dagher et al. (60) demonstrated that PVE of 50% of the
liver mass followed by HT in Macaca monkeys resulted in
replacement of 10% of the organ total volume in the
nonembolized lobe, and reversible PVE obtained with an
absorbable material determined similar results (65). Partial
hepatectomy with PVE was used in nonhuman primates and
in Watanabe-heritable hyperlipidemic rabbits, an animal
model of familial hypercholesterolemia type IIa (FH),

followed by transplantation of autologous hepatocytes
transduced ex vivo with lentiviral vectors (65,66).
Irradiation of the native liver has been investigated as a way
to inhibit native hepatocyte proliferation and enhance the
engraftment and proliferation of donor hepatocytes. Pre￾clinical studies of HT in the Gunn rat model of Crigler–Najjar
syndrome type I, showed that preparative hepatic irradiation
on a portion of the liver combined with stimulation of
hepatocyte proliferation by administration of hepatocyte
growth factor viral vector 24 h after HT led to a complete
correction of the metabolic defect during the 16-week
observation period (67). A recent study showed that porcine
hepatocytes were transplanted into immunosuppressed non￾human primates preconditioned with 10 Gy liver-directed
irradiation targeting the right lobe, engrafted, and proliferated
constituting up to 15% of the irradiated lobe (40).
Furthermore, irradiation as a host-preconditioning approach
was used in three patients treated with HT. Two infants with
urea cycle defects preconditioned with irradiation on 1/3 of
the liver mass before HT showed early graft loss. Immune
rejection was monitored through measurement of CD154+
T-cytotoxic memory cells (TcM), shown to predict acute
cellular rejection in children with intestine and liver
transplantation (68,69). CD154+ TcM were measured in a
16-h mixed lymphocyte culture, consisting of recipient
peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) cocultured with donor
or third-party HLA-mismatched PBL. If donor lymphocytes
were not available, PBL from normal human HLA-matched
subjects were used. The immunoreactivity index (IR),
represented by the ratio of donor-induced to third-party￾induced CD154+ TcM, was analyzed every 7 days after cell
transplantation and used as a sign of increased risk of
rejection when IR≥ 1.3. An adult with classical phenylk￾etonuria who received anti-lymphocyte antibody therapy and
underwent more frequent immune monitoring/immunosup￾pression adjustments in addition to the preparative radiation

treatment, showed multiple clusters of proliferating trans￾planted hepatocytes and significant decrease of blood
phenylalanine levels after HT, although graft loss occurred
after follow-up became inconsistent. Despite the encouraging
results, the authors of this study highlighted that the level of
donor hepatocyte replacement was lower than expected,
presumably because HT was performed too early within 24 h
after preconditioning (40).
An additional difficulty in cell engraftment evaluation after
HT is the lack of tracking methods to measure the number of
transplanted hepatocytes in an accurate and noninvasive way.
In preclinical studies, cells can be easily labeled with
transfection/transduction of a fluorescent protein or pre￾stained with a dye and monitored over time. However, this
approach is not applicable in humans. Hepatocyte labeling
with radioactive indium-111 was used in a 5-year-old child
with OTC deficiency treated with HT and resulted in a
noninvasive analysis of the biodistribution of transplanted
hepatocytes (70). Although promising, this technique can be
useful only for short-time tracking, being limited by the short
half-life of the radioisotope. Labeling with magnetic resonance
contrast agents has also been proposed (71) and investigated
in preclinical studies (72). In liver-based metabolic disorders,
indirect evidence of engraftment after HT can be obtained
from levels of metabolic products as a consequence of the
introduction of the missing enzyme/protein (e.g., decrease of
ammonia in urea cycle defects and bilirubin in Crigler–Najjar
patients). However, these measures do not provide reliable
information about the exact number of functioning engrafted
hepatocytes. Direct evidence of engraftment can be obtained
by analyzing liver biopsies for sex chromosome, short tandem
repeats, or HLA antigens, if different in a recipient and a
donor (22,73). However, biopsies are not always available,
being invasive. Furthermore, they only sample a very small
proportion of tissue, thus being unrepresentative of the entire
liver. An alternative approach to quantify cell engraftment
after HT could be the quantification of proteins released in
the bloodstream carrying polymorphisms in a donor and
recipient detectable by mass spectrometry (e.g., apolipopro￾tein and haptoglobin). A similar approach may consist of the
characterization of exosome cargos released by donor grafts,
as shown in a xenogeneic islet transplant model (74). High
interest has been recently shown for the development of new
methods to measure graft rejection. Since cell-free circulating
DNA (cf-DNA) is released into the bloodstream by necrotic
and apoptotic cells and can be genotyped and matched to
donor cells, it has been successfully used as a marker of early
rejection in patients after liver transplantation (75). However,
additional studies are required to investigate whether this
method can be translated to the detection of rejection in case
of cell transplantation, where the number of cells releasing cf￾DNA is significantly lower than in organ transplantation.
FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS
The improvement of cell engraftment by host conditioning or
donor cell modification, as well as a better understanding of
the immune responses involved in hepatocyte rejection are
definitely needed in order to overcome the issues limiting HT
efficacy. In addition to this, a limited source of hepatocytes
and often poor quality of isolated cells still represent an issue
for wider clinical applications. Other cell sources, combina￾tion therapies, and cell transplantation strategies have been
considered to improve HT outcome.
Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) represent an attractive
tool for regenerative medicine due to their ability to
proliferate and differentiate, as well as their anti￾inflammatory and immune-privileged status. MSCs exist in
many tissues, including bone marrow, umbilical cord, and
adipose tissues, and are able to differentiate in mesenchymal
tissue cells, i.e., adipocytes, osteoblasts, and chondrocytes.
MSCs have recently been isolated from the liver and named
liver-derived human MSCs (LHMSCs). Some studies have
shown that these cells can be transdifferentiated into
hepatocyte-like cells, thus potentially being used for cell
transplantation in liver-based disorders (76,77). Although it is
still debated whether LHMSCs may efficiently repopulate a
host liver and provide adequate hepatic function (78), their
anti-inflammatory role is undoubted (79). Furthermore,
MSCs derived from bone marrow or umbilical cord and
cocultured in vitro with human hepatocytes have shown
significant improvement of hepatic functions (80), suggesting
that cotransplanting these cells and/or possibly LHMSCs with
hepatocytes might ameliorate HT outcome, decreasing
inflammation and improving hepatocyte performance.
There has been worldwide interest in the reprogramming of
differentiated somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem cells
(iPSCs), which can be potentially differentiated into cells
belonging to any germ layer, including cells with hepatocyte￾like morphology and function, known as hepatocyte-like cells
(HLCs) (81). Several groups have developed efficient and
standardized protocols for the development of iPSC-derived
HLCs, some with GMP-approved protocols and reagents.
However, HLCs generated by current methods are not fully
mature, being phenotypically and functionally more similar to
fetal than adult hepatocytes, with low albumin and urea
production, and persistent high expression of alpha-fetopro￾tein, despite showing some CYP450 activity, as well as
glycogen and lipid storage activity (82). It is likely that these
hurdles regarding iPSC-derived HLC production will be
overcome in the near future, with several groups working on
this worldwide (83). However, a main safety concern for
clinical applications is their tumorigenic potential, which
needs to be solved before these cells can be used safely in
humans.
In an attempt to decrease the immune response against
transplanted allogeneic cells in patients with liver-based
metabolic defects and thus improving engraftment, ex vivo
genetic correction of hepatocytes for autologous transplanta￾tion may be considered. This approach was used more than
two decades ago in five patients with familial hypercholester￾olemia who underwent partial hepatectomy of the left lateral

of the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor, and autologous
transplantation. Although significant and prolonged reduc￾tions in LDL cholesterol were demonstrated in three out of
five patients, the use of retroviral viruses—unable to transduce
nonproliferating cells—drastically impaired clinical efficacy
(45). This approach has been recently reconsidered in a
porcine model of hereditary tyrosinemia type I, in which
ex vivo transduction of hepatocytes with lentiviral vector
carrying FAH missing gene was performed followed by
autologous transplantation, with very encouraging results
(84). This approach would be even more promising if applied
to HLC derived from iPSCs, thus decreasing the invasiveness
of the method.
Finally, a simple approach to avoid the immune reaction
during HT has been proposed for the management of patients
with ALF. Human hepatocytes can be encapsulated in alginate
microbeads (85), and then transplanted intraperitoneally.
This approach would allow transplanted donor hepatocytes to
perform all the hepatic functions absent in the failing liver,
without the need of immunosuppression as the alginate would
be able to protect donor cells from the host immune cells. The
technique has been proven successful in a rat model of acute
liver injury (35), and has shown encouraging results when
used in children with ALF (unpublished). Furthermore, a
recent study has shown that alginate microbeads containing
hepatocytes can be cryopreserved with some maintenance of
hepatic functions after thawing, figuring the possibility of an
off-the-shelf product available in an emergency setting typical
of fulminant liver failure (86).
CONCLUSION
The last two decades have seen a considerable development of
hepatocyte transplantation, with demonstration of short-term
efficacy and safety. However, some hurdles still need to be
overcome to widen hepatocyte transplantation clinical
applications, mainly regarding isolation of high-quality cells
from marginal donor liver, improvement of cell engraftment,
and long-lasting effects, as well as optimal immunosuppres￾sion regimen identification.
New challenges are needed to improve hepatocyte trans￾plantation efficacy, and include mainly the identification of
new cell sources, which could overcome liver donor scarcity,
and new approaches to decrease the impact of immune
response against transplanted cells, hence improving cell
engraftment in liver-based metabolic disorders.
