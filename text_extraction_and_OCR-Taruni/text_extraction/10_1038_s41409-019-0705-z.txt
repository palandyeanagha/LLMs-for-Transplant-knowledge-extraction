Sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, also known as veno-occlusive disease (SOS/VOD), is a potentially life-threatening
complication that can develop after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). While SOS/VOD may resolve within a few
weeks in the majority of patients with mild-to-moderate disease, the most severe forms result in multiorgan dysfunction and
are associated with a high mortality rate (>80%). Therefore, careful surveillance may allow early detection of SOS/VOD,
particularly as the licensed available drug is proven to be effective and reduce mortality. The aim of this work is to propose
an international consensus guideline for the treatment and prevention of SOS/VOD in adult patients, on behalf of an
international expert group.
Introduction
Sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS), formerly called
veno-occlusive disease (VOD; referred to as SOS/VOD
hereafter), is a life-threatening complication that can occur
after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) [1]. The
conditioning regimen and immune-mediated injury follow￾ing allogeneic HCT (allo-HCT) generate toxic metabolites
that damage sinusoidal endothelial cells. The expression of
tissue and von Willebrand factors contribute to the clothing
cascade activation, perpetuate the endothelial cell injury
leading to the formation of gaps in the hepatic sinusoidal
endothelium [2]. Red blood cells penetrate through those
gaps in the perisinusoidal space, beneath the endothelial
cells, and subsequently dissect off the endothelial lining, all
of which embolize as part of the sinusoid flow and in turn
obstruct the sinusoid [1]. This process reduce hepatic out￾flow, produces postsinusoidal hypertension with tissue
ischemia in zone 3 of the acinus, and concomitant hepato￾cellular damage; all of which results in the clinical symp￾toms of SOS/VOD and an associated hepato-renal
syndrome, namely fluid retention, ascites, weight gain,
painful hepatomegaly, and jaundice [3–5]. In the most
severe cases, patients may develop multiorgan dysfunction
(MOD) with pulmonary and renal involvement, encepha￾lopathy and, ultimately, death. Despite the incidence of
SOS/VOD being limited, around 10–15% after myeloa￾blative allo-HCT and up to 5% after reduced-intensity
conditioning (RIC) allo-HCT, particular attention must be
paid to permit its early detection and treatment and to pre￾vent the development of the most severe forms, which are in
turn associated with a very high mortality rate (>80%)
[1, 5]. In an effort to improve early diagnosis, the European
Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT)
revise the modified Seattle [6] and Baltimore [4] criteria,
and recently published revised diagnosis and severity cri￾teria for adults [7].
The next step was to provide treatment recommendation
for SOS/VOD in adult patients. Commissioned by the
EBMT, a global SOS/VOD Task Force was developed to
help identify and address the key challenges in the

prophylactic, preemptive, and curative treatment for SOS/
VOD in adult patients. The Task Force committee met in
2018 and identified five key clinical practice questions (risk
factors, how to treat, when to treat, supportive care, and
preventive therapy) relevant to clinical hematologists and
allied health practitioners. Practice guidelines from this
initiative for each particular question forms the basis of this
article and lays out a roadmap of common issues encoun￾tered with prophylactic, preemptive, and curative treatment
for SOS/VOD in adult patients with reference to the com￾mercially available products and on clinical trials.
EBMT diagnosis and severity criteria for SOS/
VOD
In adult patients, Baltimore criteria have been reported to be
more specific than the Seattle one for SOS/VOD diagnosis:
specifically, while hemodynamic studies could not confirm
the diagnosis in 42% of patients assessed by the Seattle
criteria, such lack of confirmation was seen in only 9% of
patients using the Baltimore criteria, a finding further vali￾dated by corroboration with histopathology [8, 9]. Coppell
et al.’s meta-analysis yielded an almost 100% discrepancy
in the incidence of SOS/VOD (Baltimore 9.6% vs. Seattle
17.3%) [5] and Yakushijin et al. report an even higher
difference of 2.5% with the Baltimore criteria vs. 10.8%
with the modified Seattle criteria [10]. This discrepancy
between both classifications was related to hyperbilir￾ubinemia, mandatory in the Baltimore, but not in the Seattle
criteria. However, hyperbilirubinemia and jaundice are
almost invariably present in classic SOS/VOD in adult
patients [8]. Therefore, it was decided to keep the Baltimore
criteria for diagnosis of classical SOS/VOD (within 21 days
after HCT) in the revised EBMT criteria (Table 1) [7]. In
contrast, beyond day 21, hyperbilirubinemia is less con￾sistent [8, 11, 12]. Therefore, hyperbilirubinemia is not
mandatory for the diagnosis of late SOS/VOD, provided
patients present with at least two other clinical manifesta￾tions (painful hepatomegaly, weight gain >5%, and/or
ascites) as well as hemodynamic and/or ultrasound evidence
of SOS/VOD. In adult patients, thrombocytopenia with
platelet transfusion refractoriness was not retained as a
criterion, given the frequency and the lack of specificity of
this symptom in the pancytopenic phase after allo-HCT [7].
Simultaneously, the EBMT proposed criteria for severity
grading of SOS/VOD once the diagnosis is made [7]. SOS/
VOD is graded in four stages of severity (mild, moderate,
severe, and very severe), based on five parameters: time
since first clinical manifestation of SOS/VOD, bilirubin
level and kinetics, transaminase level, weight gain, and
renal function (Table 2). Importantly, in the presence of two
or more risk factors, patients are classified in the upper
grade. Yoon et al. have validated these criteria in 203
patients with SOS/VOD [13]: 5.9% were in the mild, 12.8%
moderate, 18.2% severe, and the majority (63.1%) was in
the very severe grade. The day 100 overall survival (OS) of
mild, moderate, severe, and very severe groups was 83.3,
84.3, 94.6, and 58.6%, respectively, and very severe SOS/
VOD showed a significantly lower OS than the others (58.6
vs. 89.3%, p < 0.0001). Similarly, the day 100 transplant￾related mortality was significantly higher in very severe
SOS/VOD, being 36.7, vs. 8.3% in mild, 8.0% in moderate,
and 2.7% in severe (p < 0.0001). This study confirms the
worse outcome of very severe SOS/VOD, while severe
SOS/VOD seems to have similar outcome to mild and
moderate SOS/VOD. Overall further validation might be
required with careful evaluation of therapeutic intervention
to evaluate the prognosis of severe SOS/VOD in the defi￾brotide (DF) era.
Risk factors
Given the role of risk factors in the severity grading of SOS/
VOD (patients with two or more risk factors are classified in
the upper grade), an accurate identification of these high￾risk factors must be performed, as previously discussed
(Table 3) [7]. Here, we highlight several important issues
regarding risk factor evaluation. For haploidentical donors,
studies using the Baltimore RIC regimen and posttransplant
cyclophosphamide protocol showed no increased incidence
of SOS/VOD [14, 15]. However, this may not be the case in
the context of haploidentical allo-HCT with other con￾ditioning regimens incorporating one or more alkylating
agents and posttransplant cyclophosphamide. We therefore
maintain the previous recommendation to consider haploi￾dentical donor as a risk factor as any HLA-mismatched

donor. The increased risk of SOS/VOD associated with
inotuzumab ozogamicin has been recently confirmed, with
an incidence of 11 vs. 1% with standard chemotherapy, in a
prospective randomized phase-3 trial in relapse/refractory
acute lymphoblastic leukemia [16]. In particular, specific
warning is recommended when allo-HCT is planned shortly
after inotuzumab ozogamicin salvage treatment for relapsed
ALL. Similar risks are reported in clinical practice after
pegylated asparaginase recent treatment with documented
severe liver toxicity [17]. We also raise the question of the
impact of immune checkpoint inhibitors (anti-CTLA4, anti￾PD1, and anti-PDL1 monoclonal antibodies) on the risk of
SOS/VOD. Autoimmune complications, including hepatitis,
are frequent and well reported [18], translating in an
increased risk of graft-vs.-host disease (GVHD) when they
are used in the setting of allo-HCT [19–22]. In contrast, no
formal study has so far reported an increased incidence of
SOS/VOD in this setting [19–22]. Therefore, immune
checkpoint inhibitors should not be considered for the
moment as a confirmed risk factor of SOS/VOD.
How to treat
Some authors have reported on the use of high dose of
methylprednisolone for SOS/VOD treatment. A prospective
trial evaluated its administration at 0.5 mg/kg every 12 h
during 7 days in 48 patients with SOS/VOD after allo-HCT,
including 31% of patients with multiorgan failure (MOF)
[23]. Thirty (63%) patients responded with a 50% or higher
reduction in total serum bilirubin after 10 days of treatment.
Fifty-eight percent of patients were alive at day +100 post

Patients belong to the category that fulfills two or more criteria. If patients fulfill two or more criteria in two different categories, they must be
classified in the most severe category. Patient’s weight increase ≥5% and <10% is considered by default as a criterion for severe SOS/VOD,
however if patients do not fulfill other criteria for severe SOS/VOD, weight increase ≥5 % and <10% is therefore considered as a criterion for

allo-HCT. A second study retrospectively evaluated the use
of methylprednisolone at 500 mg/m2 every 12 h for six
doses in nine pediatric patients (including eight with MOF)
[24]. Six responded to the treatment (≥50% reduction in
bilirubin level after 10 days of treatment), but four of them
also received treatment with DF. The same group subse￾quently reported the outcome of 15 additional HCT pedia￾tric patients with SOS and treated with a combination high￾dose prednisone and DF [25]. SOS/VOD complete resolu￾tion rate was 67%, with 73% of patients alive at day +100.
Overall, data are scarce and difficult to interpret, mainly
retrospective and single center, with no dose defined. We
therefore recommend against the use of methylprednisolone
alone as a prolonged primary treatment of SOS/VOD,
especially given the risk of infectious complications asso￾ciated with high-dose corticosteroids.
DF is the only agent with proven efficacy for the treat￾ment of severe/very severe SOS/VOD. DF is a polydisperse
oligonucleotide with antithrombotic, anti-ischemic, and
anti-inflammatory activity at the level of the micro￾vasculature [1, 26]. Although its precise mechanism of
action in SOS/VOD remains an area of active investigation,
it involves two distinct elements: the protection of endo￾thelial cells and restoration of the thrombotic-fibrinolytic
balance [1]. Over the past decade, multiple studies have
evaluated the use of DF for SOS/VOD treatment (Table 4).
A pivotal multicenter phase III trial assessed the effect of a
25 mg/kg/day dose in 102 patients (median age 21 years,
range 0–72) with severe SOS/VOD [27]. For ethical rea￾sons, a randomization with placebo or supportive care was
not possible. Therefore, a historical control group (n = 32)
was used in this trial. Therefore, a contemporaneous and
rigorously defined historical control group was used in this
trial (n = 32), using a novel methodology screening almost
7000 sequential patients. Treatment with DF was associated
with a significantly higher CR rate (24 vs. 9%, p = 0.013)
and day +100 OS (38 vs. 25%, p = 0.034). No differences
in adverse event incidence were reported between the
two groups, including for hemorrhagic toxicity (65 vs.
69%).
A large European compassionate use program included
407 adult patients (≥18 years old) with a day +100 OS of
49%, and an overall incidence of hemorrhagic events of
12% [28]. Similarly, prospective data from the large US
expanded-access treatment protocol reported a day +100
OS of 47.1% among 430 adult patients (>16 years), and an
overall incidence of hemorrhagic events of 29% [29].
The dose of 25 mg/kg/day is well established. A well￾sized, multicenter phase II prospective study compared this
(25 mg/kg/day, n = 75) with a higher dose (40 mg/kg/day,
n = 74), without any difference in terms of CR rate (49 vs.
43%, p = 0.61) and OS at day +100 (44 vs. 39%; p = 0.62)
[30]. Furthermore, a trend toward more toxicity was
reported in the 40 mg/kg/day group, leading to the selection
for the 25 mg/kg/day dose. In the compassionate use pro￾gram, DF doses ranged from 10 to 80 mg/kg/day [28]. Day
+100 OS was 43, 58, and 61% in patients receiving 10, 25,
or 60/80 mg/kg/day, respectively. Importantly, DF at 25 mg/
kg/day was associated with a higher OS compared with
10 mg/kg/day, while the difference was not significant
compared with 60/80 mg/kg/day DF. Overall, the use of
doses over 25 mg/kg/day seems to be associated with more
toxicity without any clinical benefit, while lower doses are
less effective. Therefore, the dose approved by the FDA and
the EMA, and which we recommend, is 25 mg/kg/day. In
patients with renal failure, no dose adjustments are required,
while, in obese patients, corrected body weight should be
used for dose calculation. The recommended duration of DF
treatment is at least 21 days, and until resolution of all SOS/
VOD symptoms. However, in patients where such resolu￾tion happens before 21 days of treatment, it is possible to
stop DF earlier, in particular to facilitate patient’s discharge,
but close monitoring is recommended as recurrence may
rarely develop. Specifically, after completion of DF treat￾ment and resolution of SOS/VOD symptoms, some cases of
recurrence of SOS/VOD can be observed, albeit rarely. DF
should be resumed at the same dose, and as clinically
indicated, hepatic biopsy is recommended to rule out con￾founding alternate the diagnoses. So far, there are no data to
support recommendations for any kind of maintenance
treatment in these patients upon resolution of the second
episode of SOS/VOD, although a course of at least
14–21 days of therapy would seem prudent.
Finally, physicians should also keep in mind the very
small risk of anaphylaxis associated with DF [31].
When to treat
Given the mortality associated with severe and very severe
SOS/VOD, it is mandatory to treat these patients promptly,
and DF should be initiated as soon as possible. The EBMT
severity grading classification has facilitated the earlier
identification of those patients [7]. The indication of DF
treatment in patients with mild or moderate SOS/VOD is
more questionable. However, several lines of evidence
encourage this approach. In expanded-access treatment
protocols, an earlier treatment initiation after SOS/VOD
diagnosis was associated with higher day +100 OS (p <
0.001) [29, 32]. This suggests that DF, despite its relatively
high cost, should be initiated immediately after diagnosis of
SOS/VOD, rather than being delayed until the severity
criteria assessment has been reached. Furthermore, in the
compassionate use program and the expanded-access
treatment protocol [29], the day +100 OS in the so-called
nonsevere patients with DF therapy [28] was 68% and

68.9%, respectively, with an up to 32% mortality seen
despite treatment. While these results compare favorably to
patients with severe/very severe SOS/VOD, the mortality
remains significant, highlighting the importance to treat
these patients. Therefore, we recommend that patients who
fulfill the EBMT diagnosis criteria for SOS/VOD [7] and
whose severity grading is moderate should be considered
for preemptive DF and closely followed. In patients with
mild SOS/VOD, supportive care (see below) should be
intensified, and severity criteria monitoring should be
strictly applied to allow immediate DF initiation in case of
deterioration.
Supportive care
Cautious fluid and sodium balance management is
recommended [1]. Importantly, renal function must be
closely monitored with daily creatinine assessment,
monitoring of ingesta-excreta, and twice daily weight
measurement. Diuretic (furosemide and/or spir￾onolactone) may be cautiously administered in some
patients, as part of fluid balance control [1]. Massive
ascites and/or pleural effusion may cause major dis￾comfort or restrictive pulmonary syndrome, and sympto￾matic treatment may include oxygen therapy or drainage
[1, 33]. The latter should be performed with the same
precautions as any invasive procedure, and in particular
for DF administration and platelet transfusion support. In
patients with severe renal dysfunction, hemodialysis/
hemofiltration is required [1]. Patients with severe MOD
and MOF are generally transferred to an intensive care
unit. The usefulness of transjugular intrahepatic porto￾systemic shunt is limited to symptomatic control, with
no benefit on survival [34]. Cases of liver transplant in
patients with severe SOS/VOD have been reported [35].
Elementary measures such as comfortable positioning,
appropriate reassurance, and psychological support are also
an important part in supportive care as well as during
treatment. Pain can also result from massive ascites effu￾sion, and its management is important for the patient’s
comfort. If required, opioid can be carefully used taking
into account the patient’s renal, hepatic, and pulmonary
condition.
Nutritional support is also important, and enteral nutri￾tion should be favored to prevent patient’s malnutrition.
Parenteral nutrition is associated with fluid overload,
infectious complications, and hepatotoxicity, and should be
avoided. Furthermore, discontinuation of any other potential
hepatotoxic drug should be discussed as to its risk/benefit
ratio. In particular, whenever possible, antifungal azoles
should be substituted for echinocandin. Ursodiol if not
already administered, should be considered.
Management of hemorrhagic risk in patients
treated with DF
Given the hemorrhagic events reported in patients treated
with DF, it is recommended to discontinue any other agents
that may increase the risk of bleeding. This includes
anticoagulants, but also any other drugs that have been
associated with an increased risk of bleeding, such as
ibrutinib [36]. The risk–benefit ratio must be carefully
weighed, depending on the indication of the treatment.
Furthermore, for every patient treated with DF, the thresh￾old for platelet transfusion should be increased at 30 × 109
/
L. We acknowledge that this threshold may not be
achievable, particularly in the case of platelet refractoriness.
For invasive procedures, in addition to platelet transfusions,
DF should be suspended at least 2 h before and 2 h after the
procedure, given its relatively short half-life (<2 h). For
patients with life-threatening bleeding, DF must be imme￾diately discontinued, and its resumption should be dis￾cussed on a case per case basis and according to the risk/
benefit ratio. Although bleeding is usually not life threa￾tening in patients with hemorrhagic cystitis or severe
mucositis, their management may be difficult, and DF dis￾continuation may be necessary, again depending on the risk/
benefit ratio. Fresh frozen plasma can be useful in some
patients to correct the hemostasis disorder.
Preventive therapy
Non-pharmacologic measure
Non-pharmacologic measures rely on the reduction of SOS/
VOD risk factors. However, patient-related and hepatic risk
factors are often impossible to reverse. Nonetheless, it may
be advisable to consider delaying the HCT, when feasible
according to the disease status, until resolution or treatment
of certain feature (such as iron overload and acute hepatitis)
[1]. Furthermore, hepatotoxic drugs should be discontinued
whenever possible [1].
In contrast, it may be easier to modify transplant-related
risk factors through optimization of the conditioning regi￾men. For example, RIC regimen should be preferred in
older patients or those with comorbidities. Reduced toxicity
conditioning regimens based on fludarabine and IV busul￾fan, and so avoiding high-dose cyclophosphamide or total
body irradiation, are also effective. In addition, in vivo T￾cell depletion, especially in the case of HLA-mismatched
donors, is recommended. Finally, for graft-vs.-host pro￾phylaxis, the combination of sirolimus with a calcineurin
inhibitor should be avoided if SOS/VOD is a concern, and
cyclosporine-A should be substituted for another calci￾neurin inhibitor [7, 37].

Pharmacologic measures
Heparins have previously been used for SOS/VOD pro￾phylaxis. However, a large meta-analysis reported that the
use of unfractionated heparin or low-molecular-weight
heparin prophylaxis was not associated with a significant
decrease in the risk of SOS/VOD (pooled relative risk, 0.90;
95% confidence interval, 0.62–1.29) [38]. Furthermore,
bleeding was reported as an adverse event in 7 of the
12 studies under the meta-analysis (2782 patients) [38].
Therefore, given the absence of conclusive results on its
effectiveness and its potential side effects, heparin should be
abandoned as SOS prophylaxis.
Other agents have been evaluated for SOS/VOD pro￾phylaxis, including anti-thrombin, prostaglandin E1, or
pentoxifylline. However, none of these agents showed
efficacy for SOS/VOD prevention, and some were asso￾ciated with severe side effects [39–44]. Therefore, they are
not recommended for prevention of SOS/VOD.
Ursodeoxycholic acid for SOS/VOD prevention has been
evaluated in several prospective randomized trials. Some
demonstrated a decreased incidence of SOS/VOD [45, 46],
while others failed to uncover an advantage [47, 48].
However, the combined results of the three prospective
clinical trials using ursodeoxycholic acid alone as prophy￾laxis vs. no treatment demonstrated a reduced proportion of
SOS (relative risk, 0.34; 95% confidence interval,
0.17–0.66) [49]. Furthermore, continuous administration of
ursodeoxycholic acid until 90 days after transplantation
significantly reduced the proportion of patients developing
high serum bilirubin levels, severe acute GVHD, liver
GVHD, and intestinal GVHD, translating into a sig￾nificantly lower non-relapse mortality and better OS [50].
Therefore, the use of ursodeoxycholic acid is recommended
from the beginning of the conditioning until day 90 after
transplantation.
Prophylaxis of SOS/VOD with DF has been evaluated in
a randomized prospective phase III study in 356 pediatric
patients at high risk of developing SOS/VOD [51]. All
patients received a myeloablative conditioning regimen
HCT and had one or more risk factors for SOS/VOD. In the
prophylaxis arm (n = 180), DF was administered at 25 mg/
kg per day from day 1 of the conditioning until day 30 post
HCT, while in the control arm (n = 176) no prophylactic
treatment was administered. In the control arm, a crossover
approach allowed patients to receive DF when they devel￾oped SOS/VOD (according to the modified Seattle criteria).
Prophylactic DF was associated with a significantly reduced
incidence of SOS/VOD; specifically, 12 vs. 20% in the
control arm (p = 0.048), the trial’s primary endpoint. This
did not translate into a reduction of day 100 SOS/VOD￾associated mortality (2 vs. 6%, p = 0.10), not least due to
the crossover design, and the limited power of the trial to
establish this secondary endpoint. However, development
of SOS/VOD was associated with a four-time higher mor￾tality (25 vs. 6%, p < 0.0001) overall, and there was no
difference in the incidence of adverse events, including
hemorrhage, between the two groups.
In adult patients, no prospective study has yet reported
on DF for SOS/VOD prevention. However, several retro￾spective studies have described a very low incidence of
SOS/VOD with DF prophylaxis (ranging from 0 to 2%) in
heterogeneous cohort of adult patients undergoing either
autologous or allo-HCT [52–54]. Recently, DF prophylaxis
was assessed in a cohort of 63 adult patients treated with
allo-HCT and considered at high risk for SOS [55]. DF was
generally well tolerated, with only four patients (6%) dis￾continuing DF because of bleeding events, and the median
duration of treatment was 23 days. Four patients (6%)
developed SOS/VOD, two within 21 days, and two beyond
day 21 (late-onset SOS/VOD). A prospective randomized
confirmatory trial in adults and children is underway
(NCT02851407).
Overall, despite the absence of published randomized
clinical trial evaluating DF for SOS/VOD prophylaxis,
based on the benefit observed in the randomized pediatric
clinical trial and on retrospective results available in adults,
DF prophylaxis can be considered in adult patients at very
high risk of SOS/VOD. Very high-risk patients are defined
by the presence of at least two major risk factors: previous
treatment with gemtuzumab ozogamicin or inotuzumab,
established liver disease, conditioning regimen with three or
more alkylating agents (including posttransplant cyclopho￾sphamide), or with a high dose of total body irradiation and
an alkylating agent, previous liver irradiation, and previous
allogeneic or autologous HCT (excluding autologous HCT
with high-dose melphalan for multiple myeloma) [1, 56]. In
patients with only one major and/or multiple minor risk
factors, there is no literature supporting the use of DF for
SOS/VOD prophylaxis. Alternatively, the CIBMTR
recently published a risk score identifying patients at high
risk for VOD could be used [57]. This risk score take into
account patient’s age, Karnofsky, sirolimus use, hepatitis B/
C status, conditioning regimen, and disease/disease status at
time of transplantation (link for calculation https://www.
cibmtr.org/ReferenceCenter/Statistical/Tools/Pages/VOD.
aspx).
DF prophylaxis should be initiated with the start of
conditioning, and administered until day 21 or earlier, in the
case of earlier patient discharge. The drug should be
administered at the same dose as in the therapeutic setting
(25 mg/kg per day divided in four daily doses of 6.25 mg/
kg). In the case of SOS/VOD development under prophy￾laxis, DF should be administered at the same dose, as there
is no reason to increase it, and maintained for 21 days after
the diagnosis of SOS/VOD.

Future considerations
By providing these recommendations for SOS/VOD pre￾vention and treatment, the aim is to standardize the approach
and improve patients’ outcome after HCT. However, besides
HCT, new concerns are emerging with the development of
new treatments. For example, the high incidence of SOS/
VOD associated with inotuzumab raises the question of
SOS/VOD careful monitoring in this setting, in particular as
to the role of DF prophylaxis. Similarly, the landscape of
immunotherapy is rapidly evolving with the development of
CAR T cells and other strategies associated with vascular
injury. We must therefore be particularly cautious regarding
the potential for additive toxicity of these treatments and,
possible, SOS/VOD, especially when combined with HCT.
Another important parameter to be considered is added
cost, the risk–benefit ratio and cost effectiveness of pro￾phylactic or preemptive DF in the context of HCT. Such
evaluation should be performed, preferably in a prospective
trial or through capturing real-world data generated, e.g.,
within the EBMT registry in close collaboration with health
technology assessment bodies, to evaluate the impact and
the relevance of our recommendations, and with over￾arching goal of improving patient outcome.
