Abstract
Background: Elevations in soluble markers of inflammation and changes in leukocyte subset distribution are frequently
reported in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Lately, the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio has emerged as a potential
marker of both CAD severity and cardiovascular prognosis.
Objectives: The aim of the study was to investigate whether neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio and other immune-inflammatory
markers were related to plaque burden, as assessed by coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA), in patients
with CAD.
Methods: Twenty patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) and 30 patients with stable angina
(SA) underwent CCTA at two occasions, immediately prior to coronary angiography and after three months. Atherosclerotic
plaques were classified as calcified, mixed and non-calcified. Blood samples were drawn at both occasions. Leukocyte
subsets were analyzed by white blood cell differential counts and flow cytometry. Levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and
interleukin(IL)-6 were measured in plasma. Blood analyses were also performed in 37 healthy controls.
Results: Plaque variables did not change over 3 months, total plaque burden being similar in NSTE-ACS and SA. However,
non-calcified/total plaque ratio was higher in NSTE-ACS, 0.25(0.09–0.44) vs 0.11(0.00–0.25), p,0.05. At admission, levels of
monocytes, neutrophils, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratios, CD4+ T cells, CRP and IL-6 were significantly elevated, while levels of
NK cells were reduced, in both patient groups as compared to controls. After 3 months, levels of monocytes, neutrophils,
neutrophil/lymphocyte ratios and CD4+ T cells remained elevated in patients. Neutrophil/lymphocyte ratios and neutrophil
counts correlated significantly with numbers of non-calcified plaques and also with non-calcified/total plaque ratio
(r = 0.403, p = 0.010 and r = 0.382, p = 0.024, respectively), but not with total plaque burden.
Conclusions: Among immune-inflammatory markers in NSTE-ACS and SA patients, neutrophil counts and neutrophil/
lymphocyte ratios were significantly correlated with non-calcified plaques. Data suggest that these easily measured
biomarkers reflect the burden of vulnerable plaques in CAD.

Introduction
Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of death in
the western world. Although multifactorial in its origin, inflam￾matory and immunological events are considered to play central
roles in initiation and progression of atherosclerotic plaques [1].
Indeed, elevations in soluble markers of inflammation as well as
changes in leukocyte subset distribution are frequently reported in
patients with CAD [2–5]. However, studies on relationships
between markers of inflammation and severity of CAD have
yielded disparate results [6–9].
In recent years, several studies have demonstrated the important
role of neutrophils in all stages of atherosclerosis and plaque
destabilization leading to acute coronary syndromes (ACS) [10].
Accordingly, neutrophil infiltration has been detected in very early
stages of atherosclerosis as well as in shoulder regions of plaques
prone to rupture [11,12]. Circulating neutrophil counts and
neutrophil/lymphocyte ratios are emerging markers of the
presence and severity of CAD [13–15]. Furthermore, they are
independent predictors of mortality and cardiovascular events in
high-risk groups and a broad range of CAD patients [14,16–19].

CAD severity is not only a question about the extent of
obstructive stenosis, but the risk of plaque rupture and ACS largely
depends on plaque composition [20]. Coronary computed
tomography angiography (CCTA) is a non-invasive method
allowing accurate assessment of CAD [21]. In contrast to invasive
coronary angiography (ICA), CCTA provides information about
the vessel wall and composition of plaques in addition to degree of
stenosis. CCTA may therefore provide valuable information about
the burden of CAD with prognostic implications as well as
assessing the morphological aspects of the disease process [22–24].
The identification of circulating immune-inflammatory markers
that are associated with the atherosclerotic disease process in
coronary arteries may provide additive information. The aim of
the study was to investigate if neutrophil counts, neutrophil/
lymphocyte ratio or other immune-inflammatory markers were
related to plaque burden, as assessed by CCTA in patients with
stable angina (SA) and ACS.
Methods
Study design and population
This study is a single-center, prospective, pilot study. The study
population consisted of 30 patients with SA, 20 patients with non￾ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS), and 37
healthy control subjects. In order to assess coronary atherosclerosis
the patients underwent CCTA prior to ICA and revascularization
(percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery
bypass grafting). A follow-up CCTA was performed at three
months following revascularization in order to reevaluate the
plaque burden and plaque composition. Blood samples were
collected at baseline (prior to CCTA and ICA), and at three
months follow-up. Inclusion criteria were as follows: 1) patients
with planned ICA due to SA, defined as clinically probable angina
pectoris and positive exercise test or myocardial perfusion imaging;
2) NSTE-ACS, defined as unstable angina or non-ST-elevation
myocardial infarction, according to universally accepted defini￾tions [25,26]. The exclusion criteria were: 1) inability to perform
CCTA (contraindications to betablockers or nitroglycerine, allergy
to contrast medium, pregnancy, permanent atrial fibrillation); 2)
renal dysfunction (creatinine .150 mmol/L) or risk factors for
contrast induced acute kidney injury (treatment with metformin,
high dose diuretics); 3) known factors influencing immunological
and inflammatory markers (active immunologic or inflammatory
disease, infection with fever or use of antibiotics during the last 30
days, immunosuppressive treatment); and 4) major trauma,
surgery or PCI in the last 30 days. The control subjects, randomly
invited from the Swedish Population Register and representative
for hospital recruitment area, were clinically healthy and received
no medication.
Ethical Considerations
The study protocol was approved by the Regional Ethical
Review Board in Linko¨ping and written informed consent was
obtained from all study participants. The study was conducted in
accordance with the ethical guidelines set forth in the Declaration
of Helsinki.
Coronary computed tomography angiography: image
acquisition
Patients underwent CCTA within twenty-four hours after
inclusion using a 16-slice multi-slice CT scanner or a 64-slice
dual-source CT scanner (Sensation or Somatom Definition,
Siemens Healthcare, Forchheim, Germany). During CTA acqui￾sition non-ionic contrast medium was administered (Iomeron 400,
Bracco, Altana, Pharma, Konstanz, Germany). Beta-blocker
treatment (orally or intravenously) and nitroglycerine was admin￾istered to achieve optimal image quality. In order to reduce
radiation exposure, electrocardiogram-gated current modulation
was used in all patients. The following scan parameters were used:
1. For the 16-slice multi-slice scanner: 1660.75 mm collimation,
gantry rotation time of 375 ms, temporal resolution of 188 ms,
tube voltage 100 or 120 kV, and maximal tube current of 650
mAs; 2. For the 64-slice dual-source CT scanner: 646260.6 mm
collimation, gantry rotation time of 330 ms, temporal resolution of
83 ms, tube voltage 100 or 120 kV, and maximal tube current of
560 mAs. Upon completion of the scan, images were reconstruct￾ed, if possible in several phases of the R-R interval, to obtain
motion-free images of the coronary arteries.
Coronary computed tomography angiography: image
analysis
Evaluation of CCTA images was performed on a remote
workstation with dedicated software (QAngio CT, Medis Medical
Imaging Systems, Leiden, the Netherlands) [27], side by side in
consensus by two experienced observers blinded to baseline
patient characteristics and ICA results. A predefined window and
level setting (window 900 HU, level 250 HU) was used for analysis
of lumen and plaque [28]. Coronary segments were differentiated
into seventeen segments, according to a modified American Heart
Association classification [29]. Segments of insufficient quality for
evaluation were scored as non-evaluable and excluded from
analysis. The CT scan was considered unevaluable if 2 vessels had
3 or more segments that were non-evaluable. Presence of plaques
was visually assessed. Coronary atherosclerosis was defined as
tissue structures .1 mm2 within or adjacent to the coronary
artery lumen but distinctive from surrounding pericardial or
epicardial tissue. Per segment, one coronary plaque was selected.
The degree of luminal narrowing of the coronary artery was
quantified visually, based on comparison of the luminal diameter
of the plaque containing segment to the luminal diameter of the
most normal-appearing site immediately proximal to the plaque.
Plaques with $50% luminal narrowing were classified as
obstructive. In addition, plaque composition was assessed. Three
types of plaques were classified: 1) Non-calcified plaque (plaques
with lower density compared to contrast-enhanced lumen), 2)
calcified plaque (plaques with high density structures compared to
contrast-enhanced lumen), or 3) mixed plaque (non-calcified and
calcified constituents in single plaque) [30]. The number of any
plaques (total plaque burden), as well as plaques with different
features was calculated per patient.
Invasive coronary angiography: image acquisition and
analysis
Since the assessment of degree of stenosis with 16-slice CCTA is
only moderately accurate, ICA was used to assess the obstructive
plaque burden. ICA of left and right coronary arteries was
performed in multiple views by using the transfemoral approach.
Coronary segments were scored in the same manner as on CCTA
images, and a diameter stenosis of $50% was classified as
obstructive. Digital angiograms were analyzed off-line with
dedicated software (Coronary Artery Analysis System 9, Pie
Medical Imaging, Maastricht, The Netherlands). All segments .
1.5 mm in diameter with a ,100% diameter stenosis were
measured on the angiograms. The contrast-filled non-tapered
catheter tip was used for calibration. The proximal and distal
reference vessel diameters and minimal lumen diameter of the

suspected lesion were recorded. The percentage of diameter
stenosis was calculated.
Blood sampling, biochemical analysis and flow cytometry
Venous blood samples were collected in vacutainer tubes (using
sodium heparin as anticoagulant). Baseline blood samples of
NSTE-ACS patients were received within 24 hours of hospital
admission. For all CAD patients, the samples at baseline and at
three months were collected prior to CCTA and ICA. Samples
were centrifuged within 30 minutes to separate plasma, which
then was stored immediately at 270uC until analyzed. White
blood cell differential counts were determined in whole blood by
Cell-Dyn SapphireTM (Abbot Diagnostics). Leukocyte subset
distributions were analyzed in whole blood by flow cytometry as
previously described [31,32]. Briefly, monoclonal antibodies
against CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19, CD16 and CD56 were
purchased from BD Biosciences, San Jose´, CA, US. The
antibodies were marked with one of 3 fluorochromes: fluorescein
isothiocyanate, phycoerythrin and peridinin chlorophyll protein.
The cells were identified by combinations as follows: CD3/CD4/
CD8 (T helper cells and cytotoxic T cells), CD19 (B cells) and
CD3/CD16/CD56 (NK cells). Whole blood and antibodies were
incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature, thereafter
erythrocytes were lysed with FACSTM Lysing Solution (BD
Biosciences) for 15 minutes at room temperature. Samples were
analyzed on a FACSCanto II (BD Biosciences) equipped with 3
lasers, a blue 488 nm, a red 633 nm and a violet 405 nm. Analysis
of samples was stopped when 10 000 cells were collected in the
lymphocyte gate. Data were analyzed and subpopulations gated
with FACSDivaTM 6.1.2 software (BD Biosciences). C-reactive
protein (CRP) was measured in serum using a highly sensitive
latex-enhanced turbidimetric immunoassay (Roche Diagnostics
GmbH, Vienna, Austria) with a lower limit of detection of
0.03 mg/L. IL-6 levels in plasma were measured using an ELISA
(R&D Systems Europe, Abingdon, United Kingdom) with a lower
limit of detection of 0.48 pg/mL.
Statistical analysis
Categorical variables are presented as numbers (percentages)
and were compared between groups using chi-square or Fisher’s
exact tests. When normally distributed, continuous variables are
expressed as mean 6SD and were compared using one-way
ANOVA and Students t-test for independent samples. When non￾Gaussian distributed, continuous variables are presented as
medians with 25th and 75th percentiles and were compared using
the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test and Mann-Whitney-U test.
Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used for paired comparisons.
Bivariate correlations were performed to assess the associations
between continuous variables using Spearman’s correlation
coefficient. A p-value of ,0.05 was considered statistically
significant. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version
20 (Chicago, IL, USA) and STATA version 11.0 (College Station,
TX, USA).
Results
Study population
During the study period from March 2006 till January 2009 a
total of 64 patients were initially included in the study. Fourteen
patients were excluded from analysis: 11 patients did not complete
any CCTA examination and in 3 patients the CCTA was of non￾diagnostic quality. Baseline clinical characteristics of all patients
are listed in Table 1. Revascularization was performed in 22 of 30
SA patients (8 PCI and 14 CABG) and in 13 of 20 NSTE-ACS
patients (9 PCI and 4 CABG) within the first two months after
study inclusion. All CAD patients were treated with statin therapy
after admission.
Coronary computed tomography angiography
Data of the baseline CCTAs are summarized in Table 2. A 16-
slice CCTA was used in 10 and a 64-slice CCTA in 40 of the 50
patients. Typical CCTA images of coronary plaques are shown in
Figure 1. The total plaque burden (i.e. the total number of any
plaque) did not differ between SA and NSTE-ACS patients
neither did plaque characteristics differ significantly between the

patient groups. However, there was a trend towards more calcified
plaques in SA patients, whereas NSTE-ACS patients tended to
have more non-calcified plaques. As a measure of vulnerable
plaques, the ratio between non-calcified plaques and total plaques
was calculated. This ratio was significantly higher in ACS patients
as compared to SA patients.
Follow-up CCTA at 3 months was available in 41 patients (26
SA and 15 NSTE-ACS patients), 9 performed by a 16-slice CCTA
and 32 by a 64-slice CCTA. There were no differences in total
plaque burden or plaque characteristics between baseline and 3
months. Total plaque burden and non-calcified plaque/total
plaque ratio were 9 (5, 11) and 0.16 (0.00, 0.26), respectively, in
SA patients, and 8 (3, 10) and 0.25 (0.09, 0.44), respectively, in
NSTE-ACS patients, at 3 months.
Invasive coronary angiography
The findings on ICA are presented in Table 2. There was no
difference in the number of coronary artery segments with
obstructive lesions in SA patients as compared to NSTE-ACS
patients. Strong positive correlations were found between the
number of obstructive stenosis on ICA and total plaque burden as
well as number of non-calcified plaques on CCTA (r = 0.694, p,
0.001, and r = 0.398, p = 0.004, respectively). On the other hand,
the non-calcified plaque/total plaque ratio was not associated with
the number of obstructive lesions on ICA (r = 0.163, NS).
Immune-inflammatory markers
At admission, levels of leukocytes, neutrophils, monocytes,
neutrophil/lymphocyte ratios, CD4+ T cells, and plasma levels of
CRP and IL-6 were significantly elevated, while levels of NK cells
were reduced, in SA and NSTE-ACS patients as compared to
controls (Table 3). Plasma CRP in SA and NSTE-ACS patients
declined over time reaching similar levels as control subjects at 3
months (0.9 (0.3, 2.8), 0.7 (0.3, 1.9) and 0.7 (0.4, 1.2) ng/mL,
respectively, NS). Similarly, plasma IL-6 in SA and NSTE-ACS
patients did not differ significantly from controls at follow-up (2.4
(1.1, 2.9), 1.7 (1.2, 3.1) and 1.4 (1.0, 2.2) ng/mL, respectively, NS).
At 3 months, neutrophil counts were still significantly higher in
SA and NSTE-ACS patients as compared to control subjects
(4.061.6, 4.061.4 and 3.061.06109
/L, respectively, p = 0.006),
as were the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratios (2.060.8, 2.260.7 and
1.560.7, respectively, p = 0.030). Also, levels of monocytes and
CD4+ T cells remained unchanged at 3 months whereas NK cell
levels increased (data not shown). Of note, SA and NSTE-ACS
patients did not differ significantly in any immune-inflammatory
markers at 3 months.
Correlations of coronary computed tomography
angiography and invasive coronary angiography with
immune-inflammatory markers
Neutrophil/lymphocyte ratios and neutrophil counts correlated
with numbers of non-calcified plaques (r = 0.302, p = 0.028 and
r = 0.327, p = 0.017) and also with non-calcified plaque/total
plaque ratio (r = 0.403, p = 0.010 and r = 0.382, p = 0.024,
respectively), but not with total plaque burden on CCTA
(Figure 2). Furthermore, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratios and neu￾trophil counts did not correlate with number of obstructive lesions
on ICA. Other leukocyte subsets did not show any correlations
with any of the plaque variables, neither did CRP or IL-6 (data not
shown).
Discussion
This study investigated associations between immune-inflam￾matory markers and plaque burden, as assessed by CCTA in
patients with stable and unstable conditions of CAD. The main
finding of this study was the consistent and significant correlation
of neutrophil counts and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratios with
numbers of non-calcified plaques and non-calcified plaque/total
plaque ratio, but not with total plaque burden.
Neutrophils and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratios were signific￾antly higher in both SA
controls, not only at admission but also at 3 months. The
contribution of immune cells such as monocytes/macrophages
and T cells to atherosclerosis and plaque progression has been
firmly established over the years [33]. Howere, while being 
the most abundant white blood cell in the circulation, 
circulation, neutrophils are rarely detected in atherosclerotic
plaques and therefore have attracted less attention. Nevertheless,
over the past couple of years numerous studies have lent support to
an important role of neutrophils in all stages of atherosclerosis
[10]. Neutrophil count and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio are

and NSTE-ACS patients as compared to

emerging markers of presence and severity of CAD [13–15,34].
They are both independent predictors of mortality and future
cardiovascular events in healthy populations, high-risk groups and
a broad range of CAD patients [14,16–19,35,36].
Neutrophil counts and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratios have been
associated with the presence, severity and progression of coronary
atherosclerosis as assessed by various modes of coronary imaging
[14,15,37]. In a large cohort study of 3005 consecutive patients
undergoing ICA for various indications, neutrophil count and
neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio correlated significantly with the
number of diseased vessels [14]. Moreover, a higher neutrophil/
lymphocyte ratio was associated with higher coronary calcium
scores measured by multidetector CT in 849 clinically healthy
individuals participating in a health promotion program [37].
However, neither ICA nor coronary calcium score, provide any
information about the plaque composition. Correlations of
neutrophil counts and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratios with plaque
composition on CCTA have not previously been performed.
By using CCTA it has been possible to show that plaque
morphology is an independent predictor of prognosis [22,24,38].
Several studies have found that non-calcified plaques are
associated with worse outcomes [23,39–40]. Among 3,499
consecutive symptomatic SA patients who underwent CCTA,
1,102 subjects with non-obstructive CAD were prospectively
followed for a mean of 78 months. The death rate of these patients
was 3.1%, increasing incrementally from calcified plaque (1.4%) to
mixed plaque (3.3%) to non-calcified plaque (9.6%) [23]. Our
present data indicate that the absolute neutrophil count as well as
the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, obtained by a white blood cell
differential test, reflects the burden of high-risk plaques, rather
than the crude number of plaques. Combining these easily
available biomarkers and CCTA may be of supplemental value in
the identification of patients with vulnerable atherosclerotic
plaques. It opens up the potential for early selective treatment
and prevention of future myocardial damage.
The increased levels of CD4+ T cells and dynamic changes of
NK cells in the patient population of the present study have been
described recently [32,41]. However, we did not find any
association between these cell subsets and CCTA plaque
characteristics. Neither were there any relationships between the
well-established inflammatory markers, CRP and IL-6, and the
CCTA findings. Only one previous CCTA study has investigated
immune cells in relation to plaque burden and plaque composi￾tion. Kashiwagi et al found that an increased level of the
proinflammatory CD14+ CD16+ monocyte subset, but not the
total number of monocytes or CRP, is related to the presence of
vulnerable plaques in patients with stable angina pectoris [42].
Unfortunately, we did not measure monocyte subsets, but the lack
of association between total number of monocytes, CRP and the
presence of vulnerable plaques on CCTA was also found in our
study.
A few studies have been performed in search of associations
between other inflammatory markers and CCTA characteristics
[43,44]. Bamberg et al determined the association between several

plasma biomarkers and coronary plaque burden assessed by
CCTA in 313 patients with acute chest pain who ultimately had
no evidence of ACS [43]. Only 25% of study individuals were on
statins and those with prior CAD were excluded. Interestingly,
they found higher levels of CRP and oxidized LDL cholesterol and
lower levels of adiponectin in patients with exclusively non￾calcified plaques as compared to those with any calcified plaque or
no plaque at all. In our study, 60% of all patients were on statin
treatment at the time of inclusion. This may explain the absence of
correlations between CRP and plaque characteristics, since statins
are known to markedly reduce CRP levels [45]. Another study by
Harada et al included 178 non-ACS acute chest pain patients, who
underwent CCTA examination [44]. In contrast to the study by
Bamberg et al, they found an association between CRP and the
presence of calcified rather than non-calcified plaques.
This study has some major limitations. First, the size of the study
population was small. On the other hand, we included both SA
and ACS patients, who were examined by CCTA and blood

sample analysis prior to ICA and revascularization as well as in the
stabilized phase at 3 months. Secondly, this study was performed
between 2006 and 2009, first using a 16-slice and later a 64-slice
CCTA. The 16-slice CCTA is less accurate than the 64-slice
CCTA in measuring degree of stenosis and plaque composition.
However, we did use ICA as well to assess obstructive and non￾obstructive plaque burden and CCTA was performed twice in a
majority of patients yielding identical results. Thus, in order not to
reduce the size of the study population, all study patients
irrespective of CT-scanner used were included in the data analysis.
To conclude, both neutrophil counts and neutrophil/lympho￾cyte ratio were significantly correlated with non-calcified plaque
burden and non-calcified plaque/total plaque ratio. The results
highlight the potential utility of these easily measured cellular
markers in the risk assessment and monitoring of CAD patients.
