The surface of the gastrointestinal tract is lined by a
simple columnar epithelium that is folded to form a
number of invaginations, or crypts, that are embedded
in the connective tissue. Each crypt contains approxi￾mately 250 cells, depending on its species and anatom￾ical location. Crypt size and organization are generally
uniform within a given region of the gastrointestinal
tract (1). Of the major gut epithelial cell types, all but
one (the Paneth’s cells of the small intestine) move
upward toward the lumen of the gut as they mature.
Hence, the differentiated, functional cells are found
mainly on the villi (small intestine) or toward the top
of the colonic crypt — the intercrypt table — in the large
intestine. During the latter stages of the process, these
mature epithelial cells become senescent and are shed
intact into the lumen. Cells shed from the gut must be
replaced by a steady supply of cells generated in the
low- to mid-crypt region, where, at least in the mouse,
up to 60% of the crypt cells divide twice daily.
Because of this continuous upward migration, the
location of a cell within the migratory stream indicates
its stage in the process of maturation. Intestinal stem
cells reside at the origin of the migration, which is
found just above the crypt base in the small intestine
and at the crypt base in the colon (2). As with normal
homeostatic proliferation, crypt regeneration after
cytotoxic damage also appears to originate at this site.
Unfortunately, the stem cells responsible for tissue
homeostasis and regeneration cannot be identified
morphologically or distinguished from other epithelial
cells by any recognized set of markers. Hence, most
interpretations of stem-cell behavior are based upon
monitoring cohorts of cells before and after perturba￾tion of the tissue. This approach offers direct insights
into the dynamics of the crypt-cell population, but only
limited steady-state behavioral information on the cells
themselves. This limitation may be inevitable in the
absence of good molecular markers, but it must be kept
in mind when interpreting many current experiments.
Estimates of stem-cell number vary widely, from 0.4%
to 60% of the crypt cells, with the smallest value imply￾ing that a single stem cell occurs in each crypt. This dis￾crepancy arises largely because of differences in the
operational definition of the stem cell. It is now gener￾ally accepted that “stemness” is not a single property,
but a number of properties that can be manifested
under different conditions. Thus, a stem cell must be
undifferentiated (relative to the other epithelial cell
types, but not necessarily relative to embryonic cells)
and capable of proliferation and self-maintenance, pro￾ducing many differentiated progeny, and regenerating
the tissue after injury (3). It must also retain the ability
to switch between these options when appropriate.
Hence, the properties, and probably the number, of
stem cells in a crypt may change in response to cir￾cumstances, including the choice of experimental
manipulations (which often fail to mimic the condi￾tions that these cells normally encounter in vivo). Nev￾ertheless, these manipulations have brought to light
some interesting properties of this system, including
the possible ability of partially differentiated cells to
dedifferentiate and replenish the supply of true stem
cells. This degree of plasticity is unexpected based on
the traditional understanding of stem-cell function.
Various experiments suggest that the number of stem
cells per crypt is tightly regulated, implying that stem
cells can somehow detect each other’s presence and
respond appropriately. The number of functioning
stem cells per crypt greatly influences numerous
aspects of crypt organization and control. Thus, as dis￾cussed below, the changes in stem-cell number can alter
stem-cell cycle time, the number of divisions before dif￾ferentiation, the number of lineages each stem cell
normally generates or is capable of generating, and the
number of cells capable of tissue regeneration after
damage. Finally, because these cells are maintained
throughout the lifetime of an animal, the number of
stem cells may correspond to the number of cells that
are capable of generating a carcinoma.
In a crypt with multiple stem cells, a central ques￾tion is whether each stem cell produces just one cell
type among the various differentiated phenotypes, or
whether each stem cell is fully pluripotent, capable of
producing all the intestinal epithelial cell types under
steady-state conditions. A single stem cell is certainly
capable of producing more than one lineage, as seen
in a regenerative situation where only a single clono￾genic cell remains and yet the whole crypt cell reper￾toire is reestablished. However, this does not prove
conclusively that this also occurs in a normal steady￾state crypt. However, it is unlikely that each stem cell
is unipotent in the steady state, because one would
then expect to observe dramatic fluxes in the number
of each differentiated cell type as stem cells are delet￾ed or undergo symmetrical division. This has not been
reported. Further evidence for steady-state pluripo￾tency comes from following the expression of G6PD
polymorphisms or populations of mutant cells with

varying lectin-binding properties, as described below.
In such studies, crypts contain cells of various phe￾notypes, and the mutant areas change over time in
size and extent.
The mechanism by which a cell commits and pro￾ceeds to full differentiation is currently unknown.
However, certain homeobox transcription factors
are likely to be involved. Homeobox genes deter￾mine cell fate and general pattern formation in
many tissues, particularly in regard to cephalocau￾dal patterning, and the homeobox-containing pro￾teins cdx-1 and cdx-2 appear to regulate epithelial
differentiation, possibly by transducing signals
from the underlying mesenchyme.
Actual and potential stem cells
By current estimates, a normal adult steady-state
crypt contains four-to-six functional or actual stem
cells, upon which the entire crypt ultimately depends.
These cells appear to be located about four cell diam￾eters up from the small intestinal crypt base, spatial￾ly distributed amongst their daughters in ring of
about 16 cells (4). These cells occur above the under￾lying Paneth’s cells, and because the position of the
highest Paneth’s cell varies circumferentially, the stem
cells probably do not lie in a single plane. The daugh￾ters of these cells normally then undergo a limited
and defined number of divisions, although how this
limit is determined remains uncertain. These daugh￾ter cells, or dividing transit cells, are found in the mid￾crypt region and can mature into one of five different
mature cell types. As such a cell matures, it gradually
loses its stemness so that the cells of the upper crypt
do not have the capacity to regenerate a crypt after
radiation injury (i.e., are not clonogenic) (5). The
immature first- to third-generation daughter cells of
the actual stem cells, however, may retain some stem￾ness and are thus potential stem cells or clonogenic
cells that are capable of stem-cell function if necessary
(i.e., if called upon after damage). The existence of
many clonogenic cells (up to 30–40 per crypt, see
below), but few actual stem cells may explain some of
the variation among estimates of stem-cell number
determined after crypt perturbation.
A series of experiments using different doses of irra￾diation to reduce crypt stem-cell numbers to different
extents have been used to measure the ability of the
crypt to survive and regenerate (4, 6). This ability
relates directly to the number of clonogenic cells that
survive the irradiation, and with certain limited
assumptions, can be used to estimate the number of
potential stem cells per crypt. Such assays have led to
the proposal of a hierarchical stem-cell organization
containing three categories of stem cells, with low,
medium, and high radiotolerance. The four-to-six
actual stem cells appear to be very sensitive to DNA
damage, cannot repair such damage, and are killed by
1 Gy of gamma radiation (7), apparently as a result of
p53-mediated apoptosis (8). This extreme sensitivity
may normally stop the crypts from maintaining a
mutation in this long-lived cell, which could otherwise
undergo carcinogenic transformation.
Approximately six additional clonogenic cells per crypt
that survive 1 Gy can apparently maintain the crypt when
the actual stem cells are killed, but these cells are them￾selves killed by higher doses of radiation. These cells
therefore represent a second tier of stem cells that under
normal steady-state conditions would not exhibit their
stem-cell potential, but would become dividing transit
cells and ultimately differentiate. However, at this early
stage, they retain some stem-cell function (i.e., are
uncommitted) and can be called upon to express their
stem-cell potential if required. Additionally, these cells
also appear to have acquired the ability to repair their
DNA, a process that seems to involve p53-mediated cell￾cycle arrest, because they express high levels of p53 pro￾tein after exposure to irradiation (8). Ultimately, they may
regenerate the first-tier compartment and a normal crypt.
At higher doses of radiation, the estimate of clono￾genic cell numbers increases to about 30–40 per crypt,
suggesting that a third tier of 16–24 additional radiore￾sistant cells exists, which is the final clonogenic
resource. Thus, there is a gradual loss of stemness over
the first two divisions, and although a crypt may nor￾mally use only four-to-six stem cells, a reserve force of
clonogenic cells ensures crypt survival. Later genera￾tions possess no clonogenic regenerative capacity. It
remains unclear whether the recruitment of these
potential stem cells involves dedifferentiation or
whether the commitment to differentiation occurs
only at the third generation in the lineage.
Stem-cell division
Seeking to understand the control of cell division in the
first few generations of the stem-cell daughters is an
area of intense research. It has been proposed that a spe￾cific type of mitosis occurs in the functioning stem cells
1494 The Journal of Clinical Investigation | June 2000 | Volume 105 | Number 11

was taken 8 days later.

that is responsible for the self-maintenance of this cell
type. In general, normal stem-cell mitosis must proceed
asymmetrically to produce one daughter stem cell and
one daughter that continues to divide, mature, and dif￾ferentiate. However, mathematical modeling suggests
that about five percent of the time, a stem cell may
divide symmetrically to produce either two stem cells or
two maturing cells. In the latter case, a stem cell is lost
from the crypt by differentiation, displacement, or even
apoptosis. Changes in the tissue environment may
require different cellular outputs from a crypt and
induce the stem cells to favor one of these forms of divi￾sion. Stem-cell competition is one consequence of this
variable outcome of stem-cell division and is thought to
occur normally within crypts (9). Thus, occasional (pos￾sibly random) symmetrical divisions by a single stem
cell may gradually populate a crypt with its own stem￾cell daughters, which then displace existing stem cells
and their daughter cells. Even in steady-state condi￾tions, a single stem cell may gradually replace the other
stem cells in a crypt with its own progeny, ultimately
producing a monoclonal population of epithelial cells.
This repopulation of the stem-cell compartment may
require a considerable amount of time, perhaps about
100 days, depending on the number of stem cells per
crypt, the cell-cycle time, and the frequency of symmet￾rical divisions. Stem-cell competition provides an alter￾native explanation for the observation of monoclonal
crypts in the adult intestine, a finding that has been
taken as evidence that only a single stem cell functions
within a crypt. Instead, a single actual stem cell amongst
a population of four to six may have gradually replaced
the other stem cells, either randomly or through some
form of competitive advantage. Again, this process
implies a careful stem-cell counting mechanism.
Stem-cell markers
Proving that such forms of specialized division occur
and a stem-cell hierarchy actually exists has been
extremely difficult because there are no definitive stem￾cell markers. Various transgenic approaches and poly￾morphisms have provided results that are consistent
with stem-cell competition, but the definitive experi￾ments on stem-cell characterization have proven elusive.
For example, experiments relying upon the loss of
expression of a lectin-binding site after mutation have
produced crypts containing a mixture of mutated and
nonmutated cells that gradually become monopheno￾typic and produce a ribbon of marked cells moving up
the villus (10). The length of time needed to see such
monophenotypic crypts (an interval much longer than
the cell turnover time) and the changing width of the
resultant villus ribbons is consistent with stem-cell com￾petition. The usual caveats about such experiments
apply to this finding, because the behavior being exam￾ined occurs in response to a perturbation of the crypt,
namely, exposure to mutagens that are known to induce
stem-cell apoptosis (reviewed in 4). Further circum￾stantial evidence comes from a natural human poly￾morphism in which expression of G6PD can be seen in
entire or partial crypts (11). Unfortunately, the time
course of the competition cannot be followed, so the
spread of the polymorphism from a single stem cell to
the entire stem-cell population (and hence crypt) can￾not be measured. Ideally, a model should be developed
in which this process can be observed in real time, pos￾sibly (as discussed below) by introducing a reporter gene
into a stem cell and tracking the process, either in vitro
using confocal microscopy or in vivo using endoscopy.
Asymmetric division suggests that there is a prefer￾ential inheritance of instructions in specific daughter
cells that directs their fate: each cell receives cytoplas￾mic or nuclear information (or both) that determines
whether it becomes a committed transit cell or a stem
cell. In the epidermis and the hair follicle, the conser￾vation of a population of cells with a labeled strand of
DNA from birth to adulthood has provided evidence
for DNA segregation during asymmetric cell division,
such that the labeled template DNA seemingly remains
in a stem cell, whereas the newly synthesized daughter
strand is segregated into a transit cell (12, 13). Howev￾er, such experiments in the intestine have been unsuc￾cessful, probably due to the low tolerance of intestinal

stem cells to damage from incorporating label. Recent
unpublished work within our laboratory, however,
appears to suggest that this type of DNA strand segre￾gation also occurs in small intestinal stem cells. After a
dose of 8–10 Gy of radiation, stem cells divide sym￾metrically to repopulate the crypt, so repeated doses of
tritiated thymidine during this time will lead to incor￾poration of the label into these stem cells. After suffi￾cient time, all the labeled proliferating cells will have
been shed into the lumen, and even the slower cycling
stem cells should have diluted any label below detec￾tion limits. However, cells are found that continue to
retain label and are themselves cycling (as observed by
double labeling with bromodeoxyuridine), suggesting
that selective DNA segregation has occurred in which
the stem cells preferentially retain the template DNA
strand (Figure 1). Similar results are observed if young
mice are labeled when undergoing stem-cell expansion
(symmetrical division) in the growing intestine and
then examined in later in adult life.
It is possible that no natural marker has been
found simply because stem cells must maintain a
restricted repertoire of expression in order to retain
their undifferentiated state. However, recent prelim￾inary and unpublished work in our laboratory has
revealed an intriguing pattern of expression in the
small intestine for the RNA binding protein Msi-1
(14), which is thought to be involved in asymmetric
divisions in neuroendocrine stem-cell development.
This protein appears to be expressed in a few cells in
the stem-cell region of steady-state crypts, but is
induced over the entire expanded clonogenic region
after irradiation, indicating that it may mark func￾tioning stem cells(C. Booth and C.S. Potten, manu￾script in preparation). Because this protein also
appears to be expressed in the developing crypts, it
is possible that Msi-1 is the first natural intestinal
stem-cell marker to be identified.
The stem-cell niche
One major unresolved issue in stem-cell biology is
whether stem cells are intrinsically different from their
dividing cells or whether they are instructed by their
environment to behave differently — that is, whether
there is a permissive niche. The localization of stem
cells within the crypt and the gradual loss of stemness
in the upwardly migrating daughter cells may indicate
that the environment in which the stem cells are locat￾ed is ideal for maintaining this phenotype, and that fac￾tors that maintain this environment are diluted as cells
move away. Niche factors may control the longer stem￾cell cycle time and self-maintenance properties but
inhibit differentiation and the upward migration of
stem cells by increasing their attachment properties. A
number of extracellular matrix proteins and growth
factors and receptors have been reported to be over- or
underexpressed at the stem-cell location; these may
have a role in controlling this niche. To date however,
no single factor has been identified as having a major
influence on such a niche, although the T-cell factor
(TCF) family of factors, particularly TCF-4, may be
implicated in stem-cell maintenance, because TCF-4
knockout mice appear to lose their crypt stem-cell pop￾ulation and die. Because this factor interacts with β￾catenin, it may be involved in regulating either cell pro￾liferation or cell movement within the stem-cell niche.
A number of spatial problems arise when considering
growth factor control of a stem-cell niche. Stem cells in
the small intestine are thought to be scattered around
the crypt annulus at a distance of two to seven (with an
average of four) cell diameters above the base of the
crypt. It is therefore unlikely that any two stem cells will
be in direct contact, and is much more likely that a
stem cell may be surrounded by first- to third-genera￾tion daughter cells. It is therefore difficult to envision
an environment that is so restricted as to exhibit very
different levels of control on adjacent cells. Similarly, it
is difficult to imagine a mechanism by which separat￾ed stem cells detect and compensate for changes in
their own number. One possibility is that each stem cell
is located adjacent to a Paneth’s cell, and this cell type
contributes to stem-cell control. However, because
some animals do not contain Paneth’s cells, these are
obviously not necessary for stem-cell function. Anoth￾er possibility is that the stem cells generate a field of
stemness and the overall concentration of the relevant
factors helps determine cell fate.
Regulation of stem-cell number
As long as a single functional stem cell remains with￾in a crypt, any stem or clonogenic cell deficiency can
be compensated for by symmetrical cell division to
repopulate the crypt. Conversely, excess but other￾wise healthy stem cells may normally be removed by
a process of spontaneous apoptosis, a process that
also removes stem cells that may have incurred DNA
damage. Although more than one percent of crypt
cells are apoptotic at any one time, these cells are con￾centrated in the stem-cell zone, suggesting that up to
five to ten percent of stem cells may be undergoing
apoptosis. Such stringent control of stem-cell num￾1496 The Journal of Clinical Investigation | June 2000 | Volume 105 | Number 11

bers is vital, because one additional stem cell could
lead to an extra 60–120 cells per crypt. Apoptosis in
the small intestine is a very effective policeman of
replication errors: despite the rapid proliferation rate,
cancers are very rare.
Apoptosis is thought to be suppressed by bcl-2 in the
colon (15), a process that may have evolved to protect the
crypt from a constant need to undergo symmetrical divi￾sion to restore cells lost to apoptosis in the fermenting
cytotoxic environment of the colon. However, the 
bcl-2–induced suppression of spontaneous apoptosis
may itself allow crypt stem-cell numbers to gradually
drift upward, leading to a hyperplastic crypt. The bal￾ance of risk and benefit for each process is no doubt fine￾tuned through evolution, but with current medical
advances increasing life expectancy, the protective effects
of apoptosis suppression may now represent a greater
cancer risk than do the colonic contents themselves.
Should stem-cell numbers drift upward without
incurring further mutation, it is thought that the nat￾ural response is for the crypt to divide, or bifurcate. In
the growing animal, extensive symmetrical divisions
probably expand stem-cell numbers in order to gener￾ate frequent crypt bifurcations for the growing gut.
Indeed, many dividing crypts can be seen in the grow￾ing animal, and almost all of this type of division
appears to originate toward the crypt base, i.e., at the
stem-cell position. In geriatric animals, on the other
hand, stem-cell number may drift upward, but fewer
crypts are found per unit length.
After cytotoxic exposure, such as after radio- or
chemotherapy, some crypts will die and a similar situa￾tion will occur: remaining potential stem cells will begin
to function as stem cells and will divide symmetrically to
regenerate the crypt and finally generate more crypts via
bifurcation (Figure 2), until eventually an intact mucosa
is restored. However, in this situation, the stem cells ini￾tiating bifurcation are likely to be located at a slightly
higher position up the crypt, being daughter cells of up
to the third generation. One would therefore expect the
origin of bifurcation to be slightly higher up the crypt.
Preliminary analysis indicates that this is indeed the case,
with new crypts branching out from the middle of the
crypt. In cases of severe damage, in which all the clono￾gens are recruited to act as stem cells, multiple crypts can
be generated from a single surviving crypt. Why one crypt
survives when adjacent ones are killed is unclear, but
crypts lying close to Peyer’s patch lymphoid tissue appear
to be more radiotolerant, implying that these cells pro￾duce survival factors. The presence of a few more resist￾ant “master crypts” also has been suggested, which may
be responsible for populating areas, or patches, of
mucosa during either development or cytotoxic regener￾ation, although this remains an unproven hypothesis.
Comparisons of cell-cycle times and sensitivity to
DNA damage (apoptotic frequency) in the actual stem
cells have been made in juvenile, middle-aged, and geri￾atric mice, and to date have revealed an increase in the
number of susceptible cells in geriatric mice (16). It also
appears that the number of potential stem cells (clono￾gens) increases with age, although the speed with
which a crypt recognizes and repairs DNA damage and
initiates crypt regeneration is compromised as the ani￾mal ages (17). The reason for this less efficient homeo￾static mechanism is unclear.
Interestingly, the cycle times calculated imply that dur￾ing the three-year lifetime of a laboratory mouse, approx￾imately 1,000 stem-cell divisions occur (up to 5,000 in
man). Because every mitosis causes a shortening of chro￾mosomal telomere length, one would expect stem cells
to have a relatively high level of telomerase (the enzyme
responsible for telomere synthesis), thereby ensuring
sustained division potential. Consistent with this
assumption, telomerase RNA and protein have been
detected at the base of human colonic crypts, or just
above the Paneth’s cells in the small intestine, as expect￾ed for stem cells (Figure 3). However, telomerase-null
mice do not exhibit any intestinal phenotype until the
sixth mouse generation, indicating that telomere regen￾eration is not absolutely required until this point. This
could indicate that telomerase is not directly involved in
stem-cell maintenance, but because mice themselves nat￾urally have extremely long telomeres, it may simply indi￾cate that in this species the telomeres can ultimately sup￾port up to 6,000 rounds of stem-cell division. Humans,
with shorter telomeres, might prove more sensitive to
transient loss of telomerase activity.
Future model systems
Our understanding of intestinal stem cells is likely to
progress rapidly in the next few years, thanks to two

main advances: stem-cell transfection and in vitro
stem-cell maintenance. Expression of reporter genes
such as GFP in individual stem cells should enable
many of the theories presented here to be tested direct￾ly, particularly if the marked crypts can also be main￾tained in vitro and examined by real-time confocal
microscopy. For example, one should be able to observe
stem-cell competition within a crypt, demonstrate the
existence of distinct tiers of stem cells, and follow their
reorganization during crypt regeneration or carcino￾genesis. Analysis of individual marked cells, either in
culture after growth factor administration or in trans￾genic animals, may help determine which factors influ￾ence stem-cell cycling or apoptotic susceptibility.
Ultimately this technology should produce enough
knowledge for us to manipulate stem cells for clinical
benefit, by altering stem-cell cycle kinetics, stem-cell
number, or sensitivity to apoptosis. A number of cancer
therapies may be improved as a consequence. With exist￾ing technology, we have made initial steps in this direc￾tion by pretreating mice experiencing radiation damage
(a model for cancer radio- or chemotherapy), for exam￾ple with the stem-cell inhibitory factor TGF-β3. TGF-β3
increases clonogenic cell survival, thereby reducing the
level of normal intestinal tissue damage (side-effect dam￾age) and increasing the speed with which it is repaired.
This reduced severity of mucositis should improve the
quality of life of the patient and also allow doses of
chemotherapeutic drugs to be increased if appropriate
(18). The lessons learned from in vivo transfection with
reporter genes should also enable effective in vivo gene
therapies. The long-term introduction of genes such as
APC may reduce cancer risk in certain patients, whereas
introduction of CFTR could be used to treat cystic fibro￾sis. Even short-term expression could be used to improve
responses to cancer therapy by introducing p53, bcl-2, or
DNA repair enzymes into the relevant tissue sites.
Until recently, in vitro models of normal intestinal
stem cells have been nonexistent. Some researchers
have argued that certain tumor or fetal cell lines are
equivalent to stem cells, but this is generally due to the
presence of one or two stem-cell properties, not the
complete range necessary to define a stem cell. The cells
are certainly not from a normal adult source, are always
subjected to the various selective pressures during
cloning, and generally contain one or more mutations
(particularly p53). Therefore, the most promising
methods of addressing stem-cell questions in vitro are
primary culture models. These are relatively short-term
cultures derived from isolated intact crypts (19) or dis￾persed crypt cells (20), and are being used to develop
colony-forming assays similar to those routinely used
for bone marrow cells.
Cultures from isolated crypts maintain functional stem
cells for at least the first week in culture, as judged by
their ability to mediate crypt regeneration. Because the
correct tissue culture conditions required to reproduce
stem-cell lineages, crypt regeneration, differentiation, and
spatial organization remain to be determined, stem-cell
function has been assayed by subcutaneous transplanta￾tion in an immunocompromised animal, after various
time periods in culture. After 4–12 weeks, a topographi￾cally correct intestinal-like structure is regenerated, com￾plete with differentiated cell types (Figure 4). The struc￾tures are very similar to those observed during develop￾mental organogenesis, and may involve similar
homeobox-dependent signaling pathways. An intriguing
question remaining to be addressed in this system con￾cerns whether each structure is derived from one or mul￾tiple crypts. If the former (as preliminary data in some
cases seems to indicate), then the stem cells, (potential
new crypts), appear capable of redistributing themselves
around the cyst-like structure and organizing morpho￾logical regeneration to create multiple crypts from one
original crypt. Whether this situation involves the recruit￾ment of the existing potential stem cells or induces stem￾cell amplification via symmetrical division remains to be
determined, but subcutaneous grafting of crypts with
stem cells expressing a GFP reporter acting as a cell mark￾er may help answer some of these questions.
Stem-cell amplification is the ultimate aim of most
in vitro work because this is necessary for mucosal
transplantation to be a feasible clinical option. The cul￾ture conditions suitable for this have so far proven elu￾sive, but with the development of colony-forming
assays, combined with stem-cell marking, it should not
be too long before the factors necessary to achieve this
goal are identified. Such assays may also address the
central question of whether a stem cell is prepro￾grammed for a particular region of the intestine or
whether the underlying connective tissue has the major
influence. Grafting colonic stem cells onto regions of
the small intestine that have been denuded of epithe￾lial cells could be used to address this question, because
the former model predicts that large intestinal, rather
than small intestinal, mucosa would be regenerated.
Conclusions
Despite the lack of marker proteins, a large amount of
information has been collected over the years that collec￾tively provides a detailed characterization of the stem cells
of the small intestinal epithelium. Their number, cycle
times, proliferative potential, and responses to a number
of situations have been explored in great detail. The next
major advances will involve stem-cell transfection, for
both research and clinical purposes. In vitro, this will pro￾vide information on the factors controlling proliferation,
apoptosis, differentiation, and general proliferative
potential. In vivo transfection will support this data and
also provide invaluable information on the lifetime
behavior of stem cells. Ultimately, both have tremendous
clinical potential. It is probably not too optimistic to
expect successful in vitro maintenance and transfection
of stem cells, before transplanting them back into the gut
within the not-too-distant future.
