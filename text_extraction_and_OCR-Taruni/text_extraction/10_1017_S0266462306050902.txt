Background: Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is considered
the gold standard for imaging of the biliary tract but is associated with complications.
Less invasive imaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance
cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), have a much lower complication rate. The accuracy
of MRCP is comparable to that of ERCP, and MRCP may be more effective and
cost-effective, particularly in cases for which the suspected prevalence of disease is low
and further intervention can be avoided. A model was constructed to compare the
effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of MRCP and ERCP in patients with a previous
history of cholecystectomy, presenting with abdominal pain and/or abnormal liver
function tests.
Methods: Diagnostic accuracy estimates came from a systematic review of MRCP. A
decision analytic model was constructed to represent the diagnostic and treatment
pathway of this patient group. The model compared the following two diagnostic strategies:
(i) MRCP followed with ERCP if positive, and then management based on ERCP; and
(ii) ERCP only. Deterministic and probabilistic analyses were used to assess the likelihood
of MRCP being cost-effective. Sensitivity analyses examined the impact of prior
probabilities of common bile duct stones (CBDS) and test performance characteristics.

The outcomes considered were costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and cost per
additional QALY.
Results: The deterministic analysis indicated that MRCP was dominant over ERCP. At
prior probabilities of CBDS, less than 60 percent MRCP was the less costly initial
diagnostic test; above this threshold, ERCP was less costly. Similarly, at probabilities of
CBDS less than 68 percent, MRCP was also the more effective strategy (generated more
QALYs). Above this threshold, ERCP became the more effective strategy. Probabilistic
sensitivity analyses indicated that, in this patient group for which there is a low to
moderate probability of CBDS, there was a 59 percent likelihood that MRCP was
cost-saving, an 83 percent chance that MRCP was more effective with a higher quality
adjusted survival, and an 83 percent chance that MRCP had a cost-effectiveness ratio
more favorable than $50,000 per QALY gained.
Conclusions: Costs and cost-effectiveness are dependent upon the prior probability of
CBDS. However, probabilistic analysis indicated that, with a high degree of certainty,
MRCP was the more effective and cost-effective initial test in postcholecystectomy
patients with a low to moderate probability of CBDS.

Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is
considered the gold standard for imaging of the bile ducts and
pancreatic duct. It is widely available and enables immediate
therapeutic intervention if necessary, but it is associated with
procedure-related complications (11). Pancreatitis, hemor￾rhage, and cholangitis are the most common serious com￾plications of ERCP (12). Although complications are more
common after therapeutic ERCP procedures, they may also
occur after diagnostic ERCP and can be life-threatening. Two
large prospective studies have reported complication rates af￾ter diagnostic ERCP at 1 to 3 percent (18;19), and another
study has reported pancreatitis rates at 5.1 percent, similar to
the rate observed for therapeutic ERCP (6.9 percent) (13).
Patients with a high likelihood of pathologic condition
amenable to treatment by ERCP are most appropriately man￾aged using initial ERCP and immediate treatment, if the di￾agnosis is confirmed. However, in some patients, particularly
those with a low to moderate a priori likelihood of requir￾ing therapeutic ERCP, less invasive imaging techniques may
offer advantages over ERCP in terms of effectiveness and
cost-effectiveness. For these patients, the less invasive imag￾ing modalities may avoid the procedural morbidity and costs
associated with ERCP. Magnetic resonance cholangiopan￾creatography (MRCP) is a non-invasive imaging technique
for which there is good evidence of comparable accuracy to
ERCP for the pancreatobiliary tract (17;20;21).
We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis that com￾pared the health outcomes, costs, and cost-effectiveness of
MRCP and ERCP as an initial diagnostic test in postchole￾cystectomy patients with suspected biliary pathologic state.
This patient group was chosen as expert advice indicated
these are patients commonly seen in whom MRCP may be of
clinical value. This analysis was conducted to inform policy
decisions and takes the perspective of the health care system.
METHODS
Overview of Analysis
Cost-effectiveness of the alternative diagnostic strategies was
estimated using a modeled Monte Carlo simulation con￾structed in TreeAge Pro (TreeAge Software Williamstown,
MA). The model compared the costs and health outcomes of
two strategies for the management of postcholecystectomy
patients with suspected biliary obstruction: (i) MRCP fol￾lowed with ERCP if positive, and then management based
on ERCP; and (ii) ERCP only. Figure 1 indicates a simplified
version of the decision tree. The full tree is available from
the authors upon request.
The model considered the following differential diag￾noses in postcholecystectomy patients presenting with pain
and/or abnormal liver function tests (LFTs): common bile
duct stones (CBDS); strictures; and, in patients with nor￾mal ducts: irritable bowel syndrome; biliary spasm; chronic
pancreatitis; peptic ulcer. In addition, the model also con￾sidered the potential complications and adverse events from
diagnosis and treatment of these conditions.
The model assumes that patients either underwent
MRCP as the initial diagnostic test followed by ERCP if
MRCP indicated the presence of CBDS, with management
directed by ERCP, or surgery if MRCP indicated the pres￾ence of strictures; or they underwent ERCP as the only di￾agnostic test, with subsequent management. Patients with
false-positive results on MRCP underwent ERCP with the
potential for a false-positive result on ERCP and poten￾tial for ERCP-related complications. Patients with a false￾negative result were dealt with as described in the As￾sumptions section. Discounting was not performed because
of the short time horizon to outcomes for the majority of
patients.

Assumptions of the Model
Our model was based on the following assumptions: (i) Life
expectancy of patients is based on the sex-weighted life ex￾pectancy of patients with a median age of 50 years, with a
range from 25 to 80 years; (ii) Patients with no biliary patho￾logic condition identified at prior imaging are at a higher risk
of morbidity from ERCP than those with biliary pathologic
conditions (13) (relative risk [RR] = 2.5; range, 1.0–4.0);
(iii) a proportion of the total ERCP cost has been assigned
to the diagnostic and therapeutic use of ERCP (80 percent
diagnostic, 20 percent therapeutic); (iv) all strictures are be￾nign strictures, as the likelihood of malignant strictures is
very low in this patient population; (v) false-negative (for
CBDS) cases are treated per Scheiman et al. (22). Eighty
percent of patients present to the emergency room with con￾tinuing symptoms, and 10 percent present with cholangitis
or pancreatitis. All go on to have an ERCP that is successful
and where stones are detected and treated; (vi) after an un￾successful ERCP, patients have either a laparoscopic or open
common bile duct exploration (CBDE). The proportion who
have an open CBDE is based upon the reported probabil￾ity of conversion from laparoscopic to open CBDE (24);
(vii) in patients with normal ducts the differential diag￾noses considered are irritable bowel syndrome, biliary spasm,
chronic pancreatitis, peptic ulcer; estimated lifetime treat￾ment costs and quality of life implications for these differen￾tial diagnoses have been included.

Diagnostic Accuracy and Transition
Probabilities
Diagnostic accuracy estimates were obtained from a sys￾tematic review of the literature (20). Searches were carried
out on the following databases: MEDLINE, Pre-MEDLINE,
EMBASE, Current Contents, The Cochrane Library (Con￾trolled Trials Register and Database of Systematic Reviews),
National Health Service Center for Reviews and Dissem￾ination (Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects,
health technology assessment [HTA], Economic Evaluation
Database), and a comprehensive selection of HTA databases
(listing available from authors). Search strategies and inclu￾sion/exclusion criteria are reported elsewhere (20).
A total of 2,815 non-duplicate abstracts were identified,
and 2,767 were excluded. The included studies comprised
three systematic reviews and forty-five primary studies. The
outcome of interest was test accuracy (sensitivity and speci￾ficity).
Transition probabilities between health states were also
identified from the literature. The transition probabilities be￾tween health states (Table 1) and test performance character￾istics (Table 2) were derived from the literature.
Health State Utilities
Health state utilities (quality of life estimates) for differential
diagnoses and intermediate and outcome health states (rang￾ing from zero, representing death, to one, representing full
health) were obtained from a search of the Harvard database
of cost–utility analyses supplemented by additional searches
of the literature. Where the utility for a specific state was
not available from these sources, an assumption was made
to assign the utility of another state of similar severity or
intensity. A combination of the estimated life expectancy of
the population and the quality weighted time spent in each
health state were used to estimate quality-adjusted life years
(QALYs) for each diagnostic strategy. Health state utilities
and sources are presented in Table 1.
Costs
The model takes the perspective of the health care funder and
includes all direct health care costs and health-related conse￾quences associated with using either MRCP or ERCP as a di￾agnostic test in postcholecystectomy patients with suspected
biliary pathologic state. The average total cost calculated by
the model for each strategy includes the cost of the diagnos￾tic test, plus downstream costs of tests and treatments for
all test outcomes (true-positive, true-negative, false-positive,
and false-negative test outcomes). This cost represents the
average total cost to the health care system of using either
MRCP or ERCP as the initial diagnostic test in postchole￾cystectomy patients.
As no micro-level costing data were available, aggregate
health system costs were used. Inpatient costs were based on
the average costs for relevant diagnosis-related group (DRG)
codes from Australian national hospital data (9). Outpatient
imaging costs were derived from the Australian Medicare re￾imbursement rates adjusted to include facility fees (8). Out￾patient pharmaceutical costs were based on the government
reimbursed prices (10) (Table 1).
Assessment of Outcomes
The primary health outcome measure was the QALYs asso￾ciated with each diagnostic strategy.
Estimation of Cost-Effectiveness Ratios
Cost utility analysis was used. Estimates of incremental cost
per QALY gained were calculated by obtaining the estimates
of costs and QALYs for each diagnostic strategy from the
model.
Sensitivity Analyses
A probabilistic analysis was used to capture the overall uncer￾tainty associated with all variables in the model, by assigning
a statistical distribution to variable values. Values for prob￾abilities and utilities were sampled from beta distributions,
whereas costs were sampled from gamma distribution. De￾tails of the distributions used are available from the authors.
A Monte Carlo simulation was used, with the values
for variables being sampled from the underlying statistical
distribution assigned. Results are presented in the form of a
cost-effectiveness acceptability curve, where the likelihood
of MRCP being cost-effective is plotted against various val￾ues for decision makers’ willingness to pay for an additional
QALY. One-way sensitivity analyses were also conducted on
the prior probability of CBDS and for the test characteristics
(sensitivity and specificity) of MRCP.
RESULTS
Deterministic Analysis
The base model estimates that the initial use of MRCP would
be both cost-saving and more effective in postcholecystec￾tomy patients who have a low to moderate probability of
stones.
QALY Estimates
The strategy of MRCP first was more effective than ERCP as
an initial diagnostic test in this patient group. MRCP had an
average effectiveness of 31.63 QALYs, compared with ERCP
with an average effectiveness of 31.1 QALYs in postchole￾cystectomy patients who have a low to moderate probability
of stones.
Cost Estimates
The average total cost calculated by the model for each di￾agnostic strategy includes the cost of the diagnostic test,
plus downstream costs of tests and treatments for all test
outcomes (true-positive, true-negative, false-positive, and

false-negative test outcomes). This cost represents the aver￾age total cost to the health care system of using either MRCP
or ERCP as the diagnostic test of choice in postcholecystec￾tomy patients. In postcholecystectomy patients, the strategy
of using MRCP first, followed by ERCP if MRCP is positive,
has an average total health system cost of $6,305, compared
with the strategy of using ERCP first with an average total
health system cost of $7,004.
Cost-Effectiveness Estimates
As the model indicates that the strategy of MRCP first is
both more effective (in terms of QALYs gained), and less
expensive (cost saving) compared with ERCP as an initial
diagnostic test, we do not calculate an estimate of cost per
QALY gained. In the base case analysis, MRCP is dominant
over ERCP, i.e., MRCP as an initial test is both cost-saving
and more effective than ERCP in this patient group.
Sensitivity Analyses: Prior Probability of
CBDS and Test Characteristics of MRCP
From a prior probability of CBDS of 0.10 to 0.60, MRCP re￾mained the least costly strategy. Above a probability of 0.60,
ERCP became the least costly strategy. From a probability
of CBDS of 0.10 to a probability of 0.68, MRCP remained
the more effective strategy, that is, it generated more QALYs
than the ERCP strategy. Above a probability of 0.68, ERCP
became the more effective strategy, although the absolute
magnitude of difference was very small.
Over the range specified by the confidence intervals of
the sensitivity and specificity of MRCP for stones, MRCP
remained the least costly and the more effective strategy.
When a threshold analysis was conducted over the range
of 0.5 to 1.0, ERCP was less costly than MRCP when the
specificity of stones was less than 0.66. Above this threshold,
MRCP became the least costly strategy. ERCP was more
effective than MRCP only when the sensitivity for stones
was less than 0.595, or the specificity for stones was less
than 0.74. This finding is likely due to the disutility associated
with unnecessary diagnostic and therapeutic ERCPs.
Probabilistic Analysis
The key results of the Monte Carlo simulation and probabilis￾tic analysis are presented in Figure 2. Results indicate that
there is a 59.2 percent probability that MRCP is cost-saving,
with an expected cost saving of $1,043. In addition, there
is an 82.8 percent probability that MRCP is more effective
than ERCP (i.e., generates more QALYs), with an expected
average gain of 0.05 QALYs.
The cost-effectiveness acceptability curve in Figure 2
provides a visual representation of the likelihood that MRCP
is cost-effective from the Monte Carlo simulation. The hori￾zontal axis shows the maximum amount [in Australian dol￾lars (AUD)] a decision maker is willing to pay for an addi￾tional QALY gained from $0 to $100,000 per QALY. On the
vertical axis is the probability that MRCP is cost-effective at
a given willingness to pay.
If a decision maker is not willing to pay anything for an
additional QALY (only accepting interventions that are cost￾saving), then there is approximately a 59.2 percent probabil￾ity that MRCP will be considered cost-effective according to
this decision criteria. If a decision maker is willing to pay
AUD$50,000 per additional QALY, there is approximately
an 83 percent chance that MRCP will be considered cost￾effective according to these decision criteria.
DISCUSSION
This study has presented the results of a modeled cost￾effectiveness analysis of MRCP and ERCP as the initial
imaging modality in postcholecystectomy patients present￾ing with pain and/or abnormal LFTs. The results of the base
case indicated that MRCP was dominant (i.e., more effective

Our results are largely consistent with previous models,
although these models evaluated different patient groups, not
postcholecystectomy patients. Kaltenthaler (17) conducted a
systematic review and cost-effectiveness analysis for NICE
and concluded that the “estimated clinical and economic im￾pacts of diagnostic MRCP versus diagnostic ERCP” were
favorable. Their baseline estimate was that MRCP may lead
to both reduced costs and improved quality of life outcomes
compared with diagnostic ERCP. Arguedas (2) conducted a
decision analysis to examine MRCP, endoscopic ultrasonog￾raphy, and ERCP in the evaluation of patients with acute bil￾iary pancreatitis. They concluded that at probabilities above
45 percent, ERCP is the most cost-effective strategy. Total
costs and cost-effectiveness of the strategies are dependent
upon the prior probability of stones.
In interpreting the results from this study, we need to be
aware of the potential limitations of our analyses. First, our
analysis considers the average postcholecystectomy patient
and the most common differential diagnoses. The pattern
of costs and consequences may be different for a patient
group with additional co-morbidities or other differential di￾agnoses. Second, diagnostic accuracy estimates are based
upon all patients, not only postcholecystectomy patients. A
regression analysis conducted by Romangnuolo (21) indi￾cated that MRCP accuracy may be higher for patients with a
broad spectrum of possible pathologic conditions; however,
the reasons for this observation are unclear. Other studies
have indicated that MRCP accuracy for CBDS detection is
lower in particular populations, for example patients with
suspected primary sclerosing cholangitis (1).
The reliance on aggregate costing data (DRGs), rather
than patient level costs is also a potential limitation, with
some assumptions required because of the way that Inter￾national Classification of Diseases-10 codes are aggregated
to form DRGs. In addition, the probabilities of differential

Probabilistic cost-effectiveness of MRCP
diagnoses in patients with normal biliary ducts (irritable
bowel syndrome, biliary spasm, chronic pancreatitis, peptic
ulcer) were not available from the published literature or from
health care system data. This necessitated the use of expert
advice, based on clinical experience, when ideally epidemio￾logical data (e.g., cohort) from postcholecystectomy patients
is best.
CONCLUSIONS
The deterministic model indicates that the initial use of
MRCP would be both cost-saving and more effective (in
terms of QALYs gained) in average postcholecystectomy
patients with a low to moderate probability of stones. Fur￾thermore, our results suggest that, as predicted, the optimal
test is dependent upon the pretest probability of CBDSs.
MRCP is the least costly diagnostic strategy in patients with
low to moderate risk of stones (up to 60 percent probabil￾ity); above this range, ERCP became less costly. Similarly
MRCP was also the most effective strategy in patients with
a low to moderate risk of CBDSs (up to 68 percent proba￾bility); with higher likelihood of stones, ERCP became the
optimal diagnostic strategy.
There is considerable uncertainty regarding the max￾imum incremental cost-effectiveness ratio acceptable to
decision makers, and this threshold is likely to vary de￾pending on the condition and the intervention. Commonly
cited values for a cost-effectiveness threshold fall within the
range of $20,000 to $100,000 for each additional year of sur￾vival or quality adjusted survival. Probabilistic analysis indi￾cates that, if a decision maker is willing to pay AUD$20,000
per additional QALY, there is approximately an 80 percent
chance that MRCP will be considered cost-effective accord￾ing to these decision criteria. At a willingness to pay of
AUD$50,000 per QALY, there is an 83 percent chance that
MRCP is cost-effective.
POLICY IMPLICATIONS
This analysis supports the availability of MRCP for diag￾nostic evaluation in postcholecystectomy patients presenting
with pain and/or abnormal LFTs for which there is a low to
moderate probability of CBDSs. It is this group in whom, a
priori, we might expect the largest advantage of MRCP over
ERCP. The number of patients who would be required to
undergo therapeutic ERCP after MRCP is small, compared
with the number who would avoid potential morbidity and
mortality associated with ERCP, if MRCP was available as
an initial diagnostic test. This balance tips in favor of ERCP
being the optimal test as the likelihood for subsequent inter￾vention increases, that is, as the pretest probability of CDBS
increases.
For an individual patient, the decision between MRCP
and ERCP will be made after careful consideration of the
possibility of stones, together with comorbidities and the
likelihood of other differential diagnoses.
