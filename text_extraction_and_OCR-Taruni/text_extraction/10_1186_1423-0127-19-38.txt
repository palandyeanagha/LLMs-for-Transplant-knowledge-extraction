Abstract
Background: Human olfactomedin 4 (OLFM4) gene is a secreted glycoprotein more commonly known as the anti￾apoptotic molecule GW112. OLFM4 is found to be frequently up-regulated in many types of human tumors
including gastric cancer and it was believed to play significant role in the progression of gastric cancer. Although
the function of OLFM4 has been indicated in many studies, recent evidence strongly suggests a cell or tissue type￾dependent role of OLFM4 in cell growth and apoptosis. The aim of this study is to examine the role of gastric
cancer-specific expression of OLFM4 in cell growth and apoptosis resistance.
Methods: OLFM4 expression was eliminated by RNA interference in SGC-7901 and MKN45 cells. Cell proliferation,
anchorage-independent growth, cell cycle and apoptosis were characterized in vitro. Tumorigenicity was analyzed
in vivo. The apoptosis and caspase-3 activation in response to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or tumor necrosis factor￾alpha (TNF a) were assessed in the presence or absence of caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk.
Results: The elimination of OLFM4 protein by RNA interference in SGC-7901 and MKN45 cells significantly inhibits
tumorigenicity both in vitro and in vivo by induction of cell G1 arrest (all P < 0.01). OLFM4 knockdown did not
trigger obvious cell apoptosis but increased H2O2 or TNF a-induced apoptosis and caspase-3 activity (all P < 0.01).
Treatment of Z-VAD-fmk attenuated caspase-3 activity and significantly reversed the H2O2 or TNF a-induced
apoptosis in OLFM4 knockdown cells (all P < 0.01).
Conclusion: Our study suggests that depletion of OLFM4 significantly inhibits tumorigenicity of the gastric cancer
SGC-7901 and MKN45 cells. Blocking OLFM4 expression can sensitize gastric cancer cells to H2O2 or TNF a
treatment by increasing caspase-3 dependent apoptosis. A combination strategy based on OLFM4 inhibition and
anticancer drugs treatment may provide therapeutic potential in gastric cancer intervention.

Background
Human OLFM4 (olfactomedin 4, also known as hGC-1,
GW112), originally termed human cloned from myeloid
precursor cells after granulocyte colony-stimulating fac￾tor stimulation [1], is a secreted glycoprotein more com￾monly known as the anti-apoptotic molecule GW112
[2,3]. OLFM4 is normally expressed in bone marrow,
prostate, small intestine, stomach, colon and pancreas
[1,4]. Subsequently, increased OLFM4 levels were also
found in the crypt epithelium of inflamed colonic
mucosa of inflammatory bowel diseases [5] and in gas￾tric biopsies infected with Helicobacter pylori [6,7].
More recently, up-regulated OLFM4 expression has
been described in lung and breast [8], prostatic [3], gas￾tric [3,9] and pancreatic cancers [8,9] as well as in color￾ectal adenomas [10-14].
It has been suggested that OLFM4 is involved in cellu￾lar process such as apoptosis and tumor growth [2].
Although the cellular function of OLFM4 has been
investigated, these results do not always coincident.
Overexpression of OLFM4 has been shown to facilitate
mouse prostate tumor Tramp-C1 cells growth in syn￾geneic C57/BL6 mice [2] but inhibit human prostate
cancer PC-3 cell proliferation [15]. Moreover, up-regu￾lated OLFM4 showed a strong anti-apoptotic activity in
mouse lymphoid vein endothelial SVEC cells and
human adenocarcinoma HeLa cells [1,2], whereas recent
findings suggested a proapoptotic effect of OLFM4 in
human myeloid leukemia HL-60 cells [16]. Evidence
from these studies strongly suggests that roles of
OLFM4 in cell growth control and apoptosis may
depend on the cell or tissue type [10,13-15]. To date,
however, very limited data concerning the role of
OLFM4 in the cell growth and apoptosis profiles of gas￾tric cancer cells has been published.
In the present study, we analyzed OLFM4 protein
expression in gastric cancer cells and normal human
gastric epithelial GES-1 cells by western blotting. Using
plasmid-mediated short hairpin RNA (shRNA), we
inhibited OLFM4 expression in the gastric cancer SGC￾7901 and MKN45 cells to observe cell proliferation, cell
cycle phase, apoptosis in vitro and to assess its tumori￾genic capacity in vivo. We also explored the apoptosis
and caspase-3 activation in response to cytotoxic agents
such as H2O2 or TNF a in the presence or absence of
caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk between OLFM4 knock￾down cells and HK control cells.
Methods
Cell culture, reagents and mice
The human gastric cancer cells BGC-823, HGC-27,
SGC-7901, MKN28, MKN45 and human normal gastric
epithelial GES-1 cells were maintained DMEM medium
(GibcoBRL, Gaithersburg, MD) containing 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS, GibcoBRL, USA),100 U/ml of peni￾cillin and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin. H2O2 and TNF-a
were obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO) and Z-VAD￾fmk was purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA).
BALB/C nude (nu/nu) mice (4-6 weeks old, SPF degree,
20 ± 3 g) were purchased from Laboratory Animal Cen￾ter of Chongqing medical University (Chongqing,
China). All procedures were conducted according to the
internationally accepted ethical guidelines (NIH publica￾tion no. 85-23, revised 1985).
Plasmid constructs and stable transfection
shRNA-mediated RNAi plasmid (pGenesil 1.1-siOLFM4)
and a scrambled control plasmid (pGenesil 1.1-HK)
were constructed to knock down the endogenous
OLFM4 in SGC-7901 and MKN45 cells. After transfec￾tion and neomycin (G418) selection, OLFM4 knock￾down SGC-7901-siOLFM4, MKN45-siOLFM4 cells and
scrambled SGC-7901-HK, MKN45-HK control cells
were stably obtained, respectively (details shown in
Additional file 1: Supplementary data).
RNA extraction and quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR)
Total RNA in various cells or tumor xenografts was
extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, CA, USA),
and was followed by cDNA synthesis using the ReverTra
Ace-a-first strand cDNA synthesis system (Toyobo, Osaka,
Japan) as previous described [17]. Quantitative real-time
PCR was performed using 7500 real-time PCR system
(Applied Biosystems) with SYBR-Green as a fluorescent
dye (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) (details shown in Additional
file 1: Supplementary data). Fold changes in gene expres￾sion were determined using the “2 - ddCT” method [18].
Cell proliferation assay in vitro and cell viability
measurement
Cell proliferation and cell viability were measured using
Cell proliferation WST-1 kit (Roche) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. For cell proliferation, cells
were seeded at a density of 1 × 103 cells per well of a
96-well plates and grown for 5 days. The optical density
(450 nm) value was detected using the Microplate
Reader (Tacan, Swaziland) per day. Each assay was per￾formed in triplicate. As for measurement of cell viability,
cells (1 × 104
/well) were seeded at 200 μl of media in
96-well plates. After 12 h incubation, H2O2 or TNF a
was treated in indicated concentrations. Relative absor￾bance was measured as described in cell proliferation.
Anchorage-independent growth assay
Anchorage-independent growth was performed on soft
agar to reflect in vitro clonogenicity. Briefly, cells (5 ×

) from each colony were suspended in 0.3% agar in
DMEM and then plated on solidified agar (0.5%) in 6-
well dishes. Cells were incubated for 2 weeks at 37°C in
5% CO2 before the colonies was measured. Number of
colonies was counted at 200 × magnification for five
random fields. Each assay was performed in triplicate.
Flow cytometry analysis
Flow cytometry (FCM) analysis was performed to assess
cell cycle progression or apoptosis. (details shown in
Additional file 1: Supplementary data)
Caspase assay
Enzymatic activity of caspase-3 and -9 was measured
using a fluorometric assay according to a method
described previously [8].
Western blot analysis
Western blotting was performed as described previously
[17]. The following antibodies were used for western
blotting: anti-OLFM4 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) and
anti-b-actin (Santa Cruz, CA, USA) The relative quan￾tity of proteins was analyzed using Quantity One soft￾ware (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) and normalized to
that of b-actin (details shown in Additional file 1: Sup￾plementary data).
Xenograft tumor model
Fourty nude mice were divided into four groups ran￾domly. Each group was injected subcutaneously in the
backs with the suspension of 200 μl containing 2 × 106
cells above mentioned, respectively. The volume of
xenografts was serially measured. The mice were sacri￾ficed after 35 days. The xenografts were excised and
weighed. The inhibition rates of xenografts were calcu￾lated according to the formula: inhibition rate (%) = 1-
mean weight (OLFM4 knock down cells-injected group
or HK control cells-injected group)/mean weight (HK
control cells-injected group) × 100%. Then, the tumor
tissue was subject to total RNA isolation or immunohis￾tochemistry detection.
Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
OLFM4 proteins in tumor xenografts were analyzed by
IHC using rabbit-anti OLFM4 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK)
(details shown in Additional file 1: Supplementary data).
Statistics
Data from independent experiments were expressed as
the mean ± S.D. of at least three experiments. Com￾parisons between groups were analyzed by two-tailed
Student’s t-test or ANOVA, as appropriate, and p
values < 0.05 were considered to be statistically
significant.
Results
Efficient knock down of OLFM4 gene by plasmid￾mediated siRNA in gastric cancer cells
OLFM4 protein expression pattern was investigated in
gastric cancer BGC-823, HGC-27, SGC-7901, MKN28,
MKN45 cells and normal GES-1 control cells (Figure
1A). OLFM4 protein definitely expresses in all these
gastric cancer cells and GES-1 cells. In particular, SGC￾7901 and MKN45 cells expressed relative high level
OLFM4 protein than other gastric cancer cells and
GES-1 cells. Therefore, SGC-7901 and MKN45 cells
were chosen for further studies.
To down-regulate OLFM4 expression, a plasmid￾mediated shRNA targeting OLFM4 gene was con￾structed to stably knock down OLFM4 expression in
SGC-7901 and MKN45 cells. As shown in Figure 1B,
OLFM4 mRNA levels were significantly reduced in
SGC-7901-siOLFM4 and MKN45-siOLFM4 cells com￾pared to their HK control or parental cells (P < 0.01).
These results were further confirmed by western blot￾ting analysis (Figure 1C). No significant difference in
OLFM4 expression was observed between parental and
HK control cells. The levels of mRNA and protein for
the b-actin were similar among the different groups.
These results suggest that a plasmid-mediated OLFM4-
siRNA can specifically and efficiently knock down
OLFM4 level in gastric cancer cells. Given the analysis
stated above, therefore, OLFM4 knock down cells and
HK control cells were chosen for further investigation.
OLFM4 knockdown inhibits gastric cancer cell
proliferation and anchorage-independent growth in vitro
To determine the role of OLFM4 in gastric cancer cell
growth, we investigated the effect of OLFM4-siRNA on the
cell growth at 1-5 day time point by WST-1 assay. As
shown in Figure 2A, in all two gastric cancer cell lines, the
growth of OLFM4 knock down cells was significantly
reduced compared with HK control cells from day 3 (P <
0.01). To further examine the importance of OLFM4 in the
tumorigenesis of gastric cancer cells in vitro, we carried out
anchorage-independent growth assays and found SGC￾7901 and MKN45 cells expressing HK controls grew well
in soft agar, forming distinct colonies. In contrast, OLFM4
knockdown SGC-7901 and MKN45 cells exhibited a dra￾matic reduction in the number of soft agar colonies (P <
0.01) (Figure 2B), showing transforming abilities less than
those of the control cells. These data indicated that knock￾down of OLFM4 could inhibit gastric cancer cell prolifera￾tion and anchorage-independent growth in vitro.
Growth-inhibitory effect of decreased OLFM4 in gastric
tumor xenografts
Moreover, we also performed subcutaneous tumor for￾mative assay in nude mice to evaluate the growth

suppression effect of down-regulated OLFM4 in vivo.
Nude mice were subcutaneously injected with OLFM4
knockdown or HK control cells. Tumor volumes per 4
days and tumor weight at 5 weeks were measured
respectively after subcutaneous injection. As shown in
Figure 2C-D, whether tumor volume or tumor weight
produced by OLFM4 knock down SGC-7901 and
MKN45 cells had significantly reduced growth com￾pared with tumors produced in mice injected with HK
control-transfected cells (P < 0.01). The inhibitory rate
of SGC-7901 and MKN45 knock down cells-injected
group on tumor growth was 40.29% and 37.48% respec￾tively (Figure 2E).
To further assure OLFM4 expression is indeedly
silenced after subcutaneous injection of nude mice, we
also evaluated OLFM4 expression in tumor xenografts
using qRT-PCR and IHC. Similarly in vitro, OLFM4
mRNA level in tumor xenografts produced by OLFM4
knockdown cells also showed a significant decrease
compared with HK control tumors xenografts (P < 0.01)
(Figure 3A). Consistent with the results of qRT-PCR,
significant reduction of OLFM4 protein was also
observed in tumor xenografts by IHC (P < 0.01) (Figure
3B and 3C). Higher gray scale and stronger positive sig￾nal by DAB visualization were found in tumor xeno￾grafts of HK control cells-injected group. On the
contrary, weak brown staining was observed in tumor
xenografts of OLFM4 knockdown cells-injected group.
Additionally, more large necrosis region was observed in
tumor xenografts produced by HK control cells due to a
fast growth of HK control cells (Figure 3B upper panel).
These data provided a strong indication that OLFM4

expression at mRNA and protein levels are stably inhib￾ited indeed in vivo. Taken collectively, both in vitro and
in vivo experiments suggest that OLFM4 knockdown
inhibits the growth of gastric cancer cells.
OLFM4 knock-down delays G1 to S transition but does
not trigger obvious apoptosis in gastric cancer cells
Given our observed inhibitory effects on cell growth in
vitro and in vivo, we sought to determine whether
enhanced apoptosis or delayed cell cycle progression
was associated with growth inhibition. We first
evaluated the effect of decreased OLFM4 on cell cycle
progression. As shown in Figure 4A, both OLFM4
knockdown SGC-7901 and MKN45 cells showed signifi￾cant increased numbers in G1 phase and decreased
numbers in S phase, in contrast to their HK control
cells (P < 0.01). No significant differences were observed
in the G2/M-phase, indicating a typical G1 delay of cell
cycle.
To determine whether apoptosis is involved in this
growth inhibition, we next performed cell apoptosis ana￾lysis. Interestingly, reduced OLFM4 expression could

not result in significant changes in apoptosis (Figure
4B), which is consistent with the cell cycle analysis
showing no apparent sub-G1 phase in the tested cells.
To further examine alterations of apoptotic signals, cas￾pase-3/-9 activity was also identified by colorimetric
activation assays. Both caspase-3 and -9 activations
showed no significant changes after knockdown of
OLFM4 in SGC-7901 and MKN45 cells (Figure 4C).
These results suggest that down-regulation of OLFM4
may exert an inhibitory effect on cell growth by regulat￾ing cell cycle progression not involving apoptosis in gas￾tric cancer cells.
Deletion of OLFM4 sensitizes gastric cancer cells to H2O2
or TNF a-induced apoptosis
The distinct effect of H2O2 or TNF a on the apoptosis
between OLFM4 knock down and HK control cells was
also investigated. OLFM4 knock down or HK control
cells were treated with 10, 100 and 1000 μM H2O2 or 5,
10 and 50 ng/ml TNF a respectively. Cell viability and
apoptosis were assessed. As shown in Figure 5A-D, a
dose-dependent decrease in cell viability was observed
in H2O2 or TNF a-treated OLFM4 knock down cells.
Furthermore, treatment of 10 μM H2O2 (Figure 5A-B)
or 10 ng/ml TNF a (Figure 5C-D) led to a significant
reduction in cell viability in OLFM4 knock down cells
compared with HK control cells (P < 0.01). Of particular
interest is the finding that OLFM4 knockdown cells
rather than HK control cells treated with 10~1000 μM
H2O2 exhibited more prominent apoptotic percentages
in comparison to those treated with PBS mock (P <
0.01) (Figure 5A-B). Similar results were also seen in
TNF a-treated OLFM4 knockdown cells (Figure 5C-D).
In other words, OLFM4 knock down enhanced H2O2 or

TNF a-induced apoptosis in gastric cancer cells, indicat￾ing deletion of OLFM4 made SGC-7901 and MKN45
cells more sensitive to treatment of H2O2 or TNF a.
Caspase-3 activity is involved in H2O2 or TNF a-induced
apoptosis in OLFM4 knock-down cells
The above results indicated that knock down of OLFM4
could increase H2O2 or TNF a-stimulated apoptosis. To
further verify whether caspase-3 is activated in the H2O2
or TNF a-induced apoptosis in OLFM4 knockdown
cells, we next detected caspase-3 activation in H2O2 or
TNF a-treated cells using colorimetric assay. As shown
in Figure 6A, treatment of H2O2 or TNF a resulted in
much more enhancement of caspase-3 activity in
OLFM4 knockdown cells than HK control cells (P <
0.01), suggesting caspase-3 activity is involved in the

H2O2 or TNF a-induced apoptosis in OLFM4 knock￾down cells. To further verify whether H2O2 or TNF a￾induced apoptosis is dependent on caspase-3 activity, Z￾VAD-fmk, a caspase inhibitor was used before the treat￾ment of H2O2 or TNF a. Pre-treatment of Z-VAD-fmk
significantly attenuated H2O2 or TNF a-induced cell
apoptosis as well as caspase-3 activity in both OLFM4
knockdown cells (P < 0.01) (Figure 6C-D), indicating
that H2O2 or TNF a-induced apoptosis is caspase-3
dependent in OLFM4 knockdown cells.
Discussion
Recently accumulating data demonstrated OLFM4 is fre￾quently overexpressed in many types of human tumors
including gastric cancer, and it was believed to play a
crucial role in the development and progression of gas￾tric carcinogenesis [19,20]. Although previous studies
have shown that OLFM4 is involved in apoptosis and
tumor growth, recent observations also suggest that cell
or tissue-specific effects may exist for the OLFM4 gene.
Relatively little is known regarding the tumor growth
and apoptosis underlying gastric cancer-specific OLFM4
expression. To gain a better understanding of this role
for the altered OLFM4 in human gastric cancer, experi￾mental support is required to validate the role of the
OLFM4 gene in gastric cancer.
It has been shown that abnormal expression of hGC-1
may be regulated at the transcriptional or posttranscrip￾tional level [13]. In our present works, we directly inves￾tigated OLFM4 protein expression pattern in gastric
cancer cells and normal GES-1 cells. SGC-7901 and
MKN45 cells expressing relative high OLFM4 levels
were chosen for this study. Since reducing the target
gene expression by genetic means in established cell
lines is helpful for a better understanding of its role in
maintaining the malignant phenotype particularly in
analyzing genes that are essential for cellular survival
[21], we generated stable clone pools of SGC-7901 and
MKN45 expressing OLFM4-siRNA or scrambled HK
control by the plasmid-based siRNA approach and con￾firmed knock-down efficiency of OLFM4 gene at mRNA
and protein levels by qRT-PCR and western blotting.
Our present works demonstrate that OLFM4 plays an
essential role in gastric cancer tumorigenesis. Knock￾down of OLFM4 inhibits cell proliferation and ancho￾rage-independent growth ability in vitro. Xenograft
tumor model in vivo also implies that decreased OLFM4
can inhibit the tumor growth of human gastric cancer
cells. These results indicate that OLFM4 plays a crucial
role in cell proliferation of gastric cancer cells. Our
results also observed that knock-down of OLFM4 did
not influence the rate of apoptosis and caspase-3 and 9
activations in OLFM4 knockdown cells, suggesting that
apoptosis might not be the mechanism underlying the
inhibition of tumor growth. Thus, we postulate that
OLFM4 expression is not essential for cancer cell survi￾val, which is in accordance with a recent observation
that genetic knock-out mice for OLFM4 show normal
development and hematopoietic phenotypes [17]. To
further characterize the mechanism underlying growth
inhibition, we performed cell cycle analysis and demon￾strated that inhibition of OLFM4 expression induced
gastric cancer cells to accumulate in G1 phase of the
cell cycle, suggesting that down-regulated OLFM4 may
exert an inhibitory effect on cell growth by a mechanism
regulating cell cycle progression not involving apoptosis
in gastric cancer cells.
Resistance of tumor cells to the induction of apoptosis
is one of the main factors responsible for the failure of
many conventional anticancer therapies that use antic￾ancer agents and radiation. Therefore, apoptosis control
in cancer cells is of critical biological and clinical impor￾tance [22,23]. Anti-apoptotic activity is another impor￾tant function of OLFM4 gene [2]. In particular, H2O2-
induced cellular apoptosis was attenuated by overex￾pressed OLFM4 in a prostatic cancer cell line [2]. More￾over, MKN45 cells have been shown an ability of
resistance to TNF a-induced apoptosis [24]. Given these
findings, we hypothesize that knockdown of OLFM4
expression might enhance H2O2 or TNF a-induced
apoptosis in gastric cancer cells. Here, we showed that
knock-down of OLFM4 effectively enhanced cell apop￾tosis in response to H2O2 or TNF a stimulation in
MKN45 as well as SGC-7901 cells, suggesting blocking
OLFM4 may increase the susceptibility of gastric cancer
cells to the presence of H2O2 or TNF a.
As it is well known that caspase-3, a key executive
molecule of the apoptotic pathway, plays a critical role
in apoptotic processes in a variety of cells. We further
examined caspase-3 activation in OLFM4 knockdown
and HK control cells in the presence or absence of cas￾pase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk. We observed that treatment
of H2O2 or TNF a significantly up-regulated Caspase-3
activity in OLFM4 knockdown cells than HK control
cells while pre-treatment with Z-VAD-fmk reversed cas￾pase-3 activity as well as H2O2 or TNF a-induced apop￾tosis. The results indicate that H2O2 or TNF a-induced
apoptosis in OLFM4 knockdown cells is caspase-3
dependent. Based on the present data, it is conceivable
that up-regulated OLFM4 enables gastric cancer cells to
resist apoptosis induction by decreasing the susceptibil￾ity to anticancer drugs.
In fact, antagonists of OLFM4 have been reported to
inhibit the proliferation in others types of cancer cells
such as human pancreatic cancer PANC-1 cells [8] and
human lung caner SBC-1 cells [9]. However, controver￾sial results have also been observed. Decreased OLFM4
mRNA inhibit PANC-1 cells proliferation by S to G2/M

phase arrest [8], which is different from our results
showing delayed G1 phase progress in gastric cancer.
Certain important details (or reasons) might explain this
discrepancy. First, as recent studies suggested, a cell or
tissue specific role of OLFM4 (gastric cancer cells and
pancreatic cancer cells) may be a persuasive explanation
for this discrepancy. The most noteworthy is, OLFM4
expression at mRNA level but not protein level in
PANC-1 cells was successfully measured using RT-PCR
[8] whereas the most recent report by Kim et al. showed
that PANC-1 cells has no OLFM4 mRNA expression
[25], indicating the expression pattern and role of
OLFM4 gene in PANC-1 cells need further
confirmation.
Despite OLFM4 silencing was shown to an inhibitory
effect on cell growth and a decreased resistance to H2O2
or TNF a treatment in gastric cancer cells, it is not
eliminated that other mechanisms may also be regulated
by OLFM4 and contributes to growth inhibition and
apoptosis control signaling, considering the crosstalk of
the network. Indeed, OLFM4, a target gene of NF-B
pathway [16,17,25], has also shown a negative feedback
effect on H. pylori infection-induced NF-B activation
in HEK 293 T cells [6], indicating the regulatory path￾ways controlled by OLFM4 in gastric cancer could be
involved in a very complex and intricate network.
Therefore, complex interactions between OLFM4 and
other signaling intermediates are needed to be more
extensive investigation in our future studies.
Conclusions
Taken together, the present study provides evidences
that the elimination of OLFM4 expression in gastric
cancer SGC-7901 and MKN45 cells inhibits tumorigeni￾city both in vitro and in vivo by regulating cell cycle
progression not involving apoptosis. Moreover, suppres￾sion of OLFM4 enhances caspase-3 dependent apoptosis
in response to H2O2 or TNF a in human gastric cancer
cells. By understanding the role of OLFM4 in tumor
growth and apoptosis resistance, it may be possible to
develop a perspective strategy based on a combination
of OLFM4 inhibition and anticancer drugs treatment in
gastric cancer intervention.
