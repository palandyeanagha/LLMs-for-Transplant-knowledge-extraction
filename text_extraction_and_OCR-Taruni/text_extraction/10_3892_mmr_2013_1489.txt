Abstract. Cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis are major 
causes of mortality in the elderly. Alendronate, a bisphos￾phonate, is widely used in the treatment of osteoporosis and 
may be used to inhibit vascular calcification. However, its 
mechanisms are not completely understood. The present 
study aimed to explore novel signaling mechanisms behind 
the action of alendronate in the osteoblastic differentiation 
of rat aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). The 
osteoblastic differentiation of VSMCs was induced by an 
osteogenic medium. Using von Kossa staining and direct 
cellular calcium content determination, mineralization was 
found to be significantly increased in VSMCs induced with 
osteogenic medium, consistent with an enhanced alkaline 
phosphatase activity. Osteoblastic differentiation in VSMCs 
was significantly reduced by the action of alendronate in a 
dose‑dependent manner. In addition, the expression of Notch1 
and RBP‑Jκ was significantly upregulated in VSMCs cultured 
with osteogenic medium at the mRNA and protein levels. The 
effects of Notch1‑RBP‑Jκ were inhibited by treatment with 
alendronate in a dose‑dependent manner. In summary, results 
of the current study indicate that alendronate inhibits vascular 
calcification through downregulation of the Notch1‑RBP‑Jκ
signaling pathway.
Introduction
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major cause of prema￾ture mortality, accounting for approximately one‑third of 
mortalities (1,2). Each year, 17 million individuals succumb 
to CVD (3-5). Osteoporosis is a serious public health problem 
with an estimated worldwide incidence of >200 million (4,6). 
CVD and osteoporosis are the main causes of mortality in the 
elderly (7,8). Vascular calcification, as an independent risk 
factor for CVD, was originally considered to be a passive and 
unregulated process; however, this process is now known to be 
an active and tightly regulated phenomenon, in which a variety 
of osteogenic regulatory factors are involved (9,10). Clinical 
studies have demonstrated that the majority of patients with 
osteoporosis have vascular calcification (11), and that vascular 
calcification is alleviated following treatment with bisphos￾phonates (3,12-14). These studies are indicative of a correlation 
between arterial and bone pathologies (15).
Alendronate, a bisphosphonate, is widely used as a treat￾ment for osteoporosis and other pathological conditions 
associated with bone loss (16‑18). In addition, a number of 
studies have shown that alendronate is not only suitable for 
the treatment of the aforementioned diseases, but also for 
vascular calcification (3). Analysis of the mechanism by 
which alendronate inhibits vascular calcification is likely to 
clarify the regulatory mechanisms involved in arterial and 
bone pathologies.
Notch1 signaling plays a crucial role in cell fate 
determination and various developmental processes, and 
translates cell‑cell interactions into specific transcriptional 
programs (19‑23). In the transcriptional process, cell‑cell 
interactions cause cleavage of the Notch intracellular 
domain (NICD), which migrates into the nucleus and asso￾ciates with RBP‑Jκ, further activating the transcription of 
target genes (22,23). Msx2, the target gene activated by the 
Notch1‑RBP‑Jκ signaling pathway, is considered to represent a 
key regulator of vascular calcification and has been identified 
as a homeodomain transcription factor responsible for osteo￾blast differentiation and mineralization (9,22,24,25).
However, to date, a limited number of studies have 
focused on the effect of alendronate on the expression 
of the Notch1‑RBP‑Jκ signaling pathway. In the present 
study, an in vitro rat model of vascular calcification was 
used to determine the effect of alendronate on expression 
of the Notch1‑RBP‑Jκ signaling pathway, and the possible 
mechanisms behind the inhibition of artery calcification by 
alendronate were explored.

Materials and methods
Cell culture. Primary vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) 
were isolated from the thoracic aortas of Sprague-Dawley 
rats (4 weeks old; male; Animal Center, Tongji Medical 
College, Wuhan, China), maintained in Dulbecco's modified 
Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% FBS, 100 U/ml peni￾cillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin and incubated in 75-cm2
tissue culture flasks at a density of 1x104 cells/ml. VSMCs at 
passages 5 and 6 were used for subsequent experiments. The 
study was approved by the ethics committee of the Institutional 
Animal Care and Use Committee at Tongji Medical College, 
Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 
China.
Osteoblastic differentiation was induced by culturing cells 
in osteogenic medium containing 50 mg/ml ascorbate‑2‑phos￾phate and 10 mmol/l β‑glycerol phosphate. DMEM was used 
as a control. N‑[N‑(3,5‑difluorophenacetyl‑L‑alanyl)]‑S‑phen‑ 
yl‑glycinet‑butyl ester (DAPT; 10 mmol/l), a potent γ‑secretase 
inhibitor, was used as a positive control for inhibition of the 
Notch1‑RBP‑Jκ-dependent signaling pathway (26). VSMCs 
were also cultured in the presence of various concentrations of 
alendronate (10‑8
, 10‑6
, 10‑4
 and 10‑3 mmol/l). After 14 days, 
cultured VSMCs were subjected to the following experimental 
conditions in 7 groups: the control (VSMCs cultured with 
DMEM); osteogenic (OS; VSMCs cultured with osteogenic 
medium); and DAPT groups (VSMCs cultured with OS and 
DAPT); and the alendronate groups (VSMCs cultured with OS 
and alendronate), which were divided into four subgroups 
based on varying concentrations of alendronate (10‑8
, 10‑6
, 10‑4
and 10‑3 mmol/l). The medium was replaced with fresh medium 
every 2 days. For time‑course experiments, the first day of 
culture in calcification medium was defined as day 0.
von Kossa staining. Cells in culture flasks were washed 3 times 
with PBS, followed by a fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde 
for 15 min. Next, cells were washed 3 times with distilled 
water, incubated with 5% silver nitrate solution and exposed 
to bright sunlight for 30 min, then washed with distilled water 
for 5 min and treated with 5% sodium thiosulfate for 2 min. 
Calcium particles were observed by microscope in visual 
fields (magnification, x40).
Measurement of calcium content. Cultures were decalci￾fied with 0.6 mol/l HCl for 24 h. The calcium content of the 
HCl supernatant was determined by the o‑cresolphthalein 
complexone method (calcium kit; Nanjing Jiancheng 
Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China). Following decalci￾fication, the cells were washed with PBS and solubilized with 
0.1 mol/l NaOH‑0.1% SDS. The cells were dissolved in HNO3 
and then dried in an oven and redissolved with blank solu￾tion (27 nmol/l KCl and 27 µmol/l LaCl3 in deionized water). 
Calcium content was measured using an atomic absorption 
spectrophotometer (SpectrAA‑240 FS; Agilent Technologies, 
Santa Clara, CA, USA) at 422.7 nm.
Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) assay. ALP activity of various 
cells was measured using a Lab Assay ALP kit (Nanjing 
Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute), according to the manu￾facturer's instructions.
Real‑time quantitative PCR. Total RNA was isolated from the 
VSMCs using the TRIzol chloroform method, according to 
the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen Life Technologies, 
Carlsbad, CA, USA), and reverse transcribed into cDNA 
with a Toyoba reverse transcription kit (Thermo Fisher 
Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA). Real‑time quantitative 
PCR was performed using the ABI PRISM 7900 sequence 
detector system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), 
according to the manufacturer's instructions. β‑actin was 
used as an endogenous control. The PCR mixture contained 
SYBR Green/Fluorescein qPCR Master Mix (2X; Thermo 
Fisher Scientific Inc.), cDNA and the primers. Relative 
gene expression levels (the amount of target, normalized 
against an endogenous control gene) were calculated using 
the comparative Ct method formula, 2‑ΔΔCt. The following 
primer sequences were used for real‑time quantitative PCR: 
rat Notch1 forward, 5'‑GAGGCTTGAGATGCTCCCAG‑3' 
and reverse, 5'‑ATTCTTACATGGTGTGCTGAGG‑3'; rat 
RBP‑Jκ forward, 5'‑GAGCCATTCTCAGAGCCAAC‑3' and 
reverse, 5'‑TCCCCAAGAAACCACAAAAG‑3'; rat msx2 
forward, 5'‑AAGGCAAAAAGACTGCAGGA‑3' and reverse, 
5'‑GGATGGGAAGCACAGGTCTA‑3'; and β‑actin forward, 
5'‑CACGATGGAGGGGCCGGACTCATC‑3' and reverse, 
5'‑TAAAGACCTCTATGCCAACACAGT‑3'
Western blot analysis. Total protein was extracted from 
cultured VSMCs in radio immunoprecipitation assay buffer 
containing 50 mmol/l Tris, 150 mmol/l NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 
0.5% sodium deoxycholate and 1% Triton X‑100 in the presence 
of aprotinin, PMSF, okadaic acid and leupeptin. Total protein 
(50 µg/sample) was loaded onto 12% SDS‑polyacrylamide 
gels and separated at 100 V, followed by transfer to PVDF 
membranes at 200 mA and 4˚C for 70 and 110 min for Notch1 
and Msx2, and RBP‑Jκ signals, respectively. Membranes were 
blocked in 5% non‑fat milk in 0.1 mol/l PBS (pH 7.4) at room 
temperature for 2 h and then incubated with the following 
primary antibodies: goat anti‑Notch1 polyclonal (1:400), rabbit 
anti‑RBP‑Jκ polyclonal (1:300) or goat anti‑Msx2 polyclonal 
(1:400; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, 
USA). Following washing, membranes were incubated in 
HRP‑conjugated rabbit anti‑goat or goat anti‑rabbit secondary 
antibodies (1:40,000; Wuhan Boster Biological Technology 
Ltd., Wuhan, Hubei, China) for 2 h at room temperature, 
followed by washing and 5 min incubation with enhanced 
chemiluminescence reagents. The membranes were stripped 
and equal protein loading was determined by GAPDH expres￾sion using a mouse monoclonal antibody (1:75,000; GoodHere 
Biological Technology, Ltd., Hangzhou, China).
Statistical analysis. Data are presented as the mean ± SEM. 
Significant differences were estimated by ANOVA followed 
by Student‑Newman‑Keuls multiple comparison tests. P≤0.05 
was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference. 
All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software 
(version 17.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).

calcification of VSMCs, von Kossa staining was performed 

MOLECULAR MEDICINE REPORTS 8: 89-94, 2013 91
and the results showed that no calcification was detected in 
the control group (Fig. 1A), while a marked positive staining 
(black) was detected in VSMCs cultured in osteogenic 
medium (Fig. 1B), indicating increased calcification in 
VSMCs. Increased calcification was eradicated significantly 
by DAPT treatment (Fig. 1G). The calcification of VSMCs 
was markedly reduced in the presence of alendronate in a 
dose‑dependent manner (Fig. 1C‑F) compared with those in 
osteogenic medium only (Fig. 1B), indicating that alendronate 
and DAPT repressed the calcification of VSMCs induced by 
osteogenic media.
ALP activity and calcium content of VSMCs. To further 
determine the calcification of VSMCs, ALP activity and 
calcium content were analyzed. The results showed that ALP 
activity (Fig. 2A) and calcium content (Fig. 2B) were signifi￾cantly increased in VSMCs treated with osteogenic media 
(P<0.05 vs. control). Again, the osteogenic conversion of 
VSMCs was repressed by DAPT and reduced in the presence 
of alendronate in a dose‑dependent manner (P<0.01 vs. the 
osteogenic group). ALP activity and calcium content reached 
minimum levels at 10‑4 mmol/l alendronate (P<0.05 vs. the 
osteogenic group; Fig. 2).
Alendronate downregulates the Notch1‑RBP‑Jκ‑dependent 
signaling pathway. mRNA and protein levels of 
Notch1 (Fig. 3A and B) and RBP‑Jκ (Fig. 3C and D) in 
VSMCs were measured by real‑time RT‑PCR and western 
blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 3, Notch1 and RBP‑Jκ were 
significantly increased at the mRNA and protein levels in the 
osteogenic group compared with controls (P<0.05), indicating 
that the Notch1‑RBP‑Jκ signaling pathway was activated in the 
osteogenic conversion of VSMCs.
To determine the effects of alendronate on expression of the 
Notch1‑RBP‑Jκ signaling pathway in vitro, four concentrations 
(10‑8
, 10‑6
, 10‑4
 and 10‑3 mmol/l) of alendronate were added 
to osteogenic VSMCs and DAPT was added as a positive 
control for inhibition of the Notch1‑RBP‑Jκ signaling pathway. 
The results showed that alendronate reduced the expression 
of Notch1 and RBP‑Jκ compared with the osteogenic media 
group in a dose‑dependent manner, and the expression of 
Notch1 and RBP‑Jκ reached minimum levels at a dose of

manner, reaching a minimum at 10‑4 mmol/l alendronate. *

Discussion
Osteoporosis and vascular calcification share a number of 
common risk factors and pathogenetic mechanisms, involving 
proteins, hormones, elements, lipids and vitamins (27). 
Previous studies have indicated that bone morphogenetic 
proteins, the RANKL/RANK/OPG and Wnt signaling path￾ways, matrix Gla protein, vitamins K and D, osteopontin and 
the renin‑angiotensin‑aldosterone system are involved in this 
process (2,23). In addition, the Notch signaling pathway plays 
a key role in the development and homeostasis of the cardio￾vascular system and bone (19,23,29‑32).
VSMC fate decisions, including cell growth, migration 
and apoptosis, are fundamental features in the pathogenesis 
of vascular disease. The signaling pathways that regulate 
VSMC growth, death, differentiation and migration are the 
focus of regulation and control targets, and recent studies have 
attempted to clarify the pathway for osteoblastic transformation 
of VSMCs, including the Wnt signaling pathway (28,33-35). 
The Notch signaling pathway is also important and the Notch1 
signaling pathway has been reported to induce the osteogenic 
differentiation and mineralization of VSMCs (22). The Notch1 
signaling pathway promotes the osteogenic differentiation and 
mineralization of VSMCs by direct activation of Msx2 gene 
transcription via RBP‑Jκ (22,36,37). RBP‑Jκ, a major mediator 
of Notch1 signaling, binds NICDs and forms a complex that 
further activates the transcription of target genes from their 
cognate DNA binding sequence in the nucleus (21,22,37).
Msx2, the downstream target gene of the Notch1‑RBP‑Jκ
signaling pathway, is a key regulatory osteogenic factor of 
vascular calcification. Decreased levels of Msx2 imply that the 
osteogenic differentiation of VSMCs is inhibited (22,38). In 
the present study, the expression of Notch1 and RBP‑Jκ was 
increased in osteogenic VSMCs, consistent with the increased 
intracellular calcium deposition (P<0.05). The osteogenic 
effects on VSMCs, including increased Msx2, enhanced 
ALP activity and the deposition of calcium in VSMCs, were 
eradicated by DAPT, an inhibitor of the Notch1 signaling 
pathway (26), indicating that the Notch1‑RBP‑Jκ signaling
pathway contributes to the calcification of VSMCs (P<0.05).
In clinical medicine, alendronate has been successfully 
developed as a treatment for osteoporosis and other pathological 
conditions associated with bone loss (6,13,29). Clinical studies 
have shown that alendronate may also be used for treating 
vascular calcification (3,4,25). In addition, alendronate inhibits 
the calcification of arteries and valves without affecting serum 
levels of calcium or phosphate (12). Results of the present study 
demonstrated that alendronate represses VSMC calcification 
via downregulation of the Notch1‑RBP‑Jκ signaling pathway 
in vitro in a dose‑dependent manner. The expression of 
Msx2, the downstream target of the Notch1‑RBP‑Jκ signaling 
pathway, was repressed in a dose‑dependent manner. These 
observations indicate that osteogenic conversion of VSMCs 
may be repressed by alendronate through downregulation of 
the Notch1‑RBp‑Jκ signaling pathway.
In summary, results of this study indicate that VSMCs 
differentiate into osteoblast‑like cells by upregulating the 
Notch1‑RBP‑Jκ signaling pathway, and osteogenic transfor￾mation leads to vascular calcification. Alendronate was found 
to inhibit osteogenic transformation regulated by this pathway 
to protect arteries. Alendronate, a drug that has been found to 
protect the arteries and bones, is likely to be important for the 
prevention of CVD and osteoporosis to preserve the quality of 
life of elderly individuals.
