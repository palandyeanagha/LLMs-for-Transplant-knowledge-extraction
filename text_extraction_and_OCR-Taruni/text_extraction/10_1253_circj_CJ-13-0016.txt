the calcification of large arteries during chronic kidney dis￾ease13 and hemodialysis.14 Two ectonucleotidases have been 
implicated in ePPi homeostasis during arterial vascular smooth 
muscle calcification:15 tissue-nonspecific ALP (TNAP) hydro￾lyzes ePPi to phosphate,16 and nucleotide pyrophosphatase/
phosphodiesterase-1 (eNPP1) generates ePPi by extracellular 
ATP hydrolysis.17 In the aortic wall, approximately 90% of 
ATP is hydrolyzed to Pi via ectonucleoside triphosphate di￾phosphohydrolase 1 (eNTPD1).15

with nucleosides (as nucleosides 5’-di- and -triphosphates) may

alkaline phosphatases (ALP) family (EC 3.1.3.1), and (4) the

the distinct ectonucleotidase species depends on differential 
tissue expression, cell distribution, and substrate availability 
and preference.

Prevention of Vascular Calcification by 
Polyphosphates and Nucleotides
– Role of ATP –
Ricardo Villa-Bellosta, PhD; Víctor Sorribas, PhD
Background: In recent decades, the prevention of vascular calcification (VC) by pyrophosphate (PPi), bisphospho￾nates, and polyphosphates has been extensively reported. However, the possibility of direct inhibition of calcium 
phosphate deposition (CPD) by nucleoside-associated polyphosphates has not been addressed. We analyzed the 
role of ATP as an inhibitor of calcification in 2 ways: by characterizing the extracellular hydrolysis of ATP as source 
of PPi in the aorta, and by demonstrating the ability of ATP to prevent CPD by acting as a polyphosphate.
Methods and Results: In our study, both PPi and ATP hydrolysis in the rat aorta was kinetically characterized, 
thereby resulting in apparent Michaelis-Menten constants of 179 and 435μmol/l, respectively, with the corresponding 
maximal velocities of 55.1 and 6,177nmol·g–1 ·min–1. According to these kinetic parameters, the theoretical PPi 
concentration in the aortic wall was 0.4–3.5μmol/L (for an ATP concentration range of 0.1–1.0μmol/L). In addition, 
we showed that nonhydrolyzable molecules are more efficient as CPD inhibitors than endogenous compounds, in 
accordance with the IC50 values: 1.2–2.4μmol/L for bisphosphonates vs. 8.8μmol/L for PPi, and 0.5–1.5μmol/L for 
nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs vs. 3.2μmol/L for ATP.
Conclusions: Extracellular ATP can play an important role in the prevention of VC, not only as the source of PPi 
but also as a direct inhibitor of CPD.  (Circ J 2013; 77: 2145–2151)

ATP hydrolysis, the aortas were incubated with [α32P]ATP in 
physiologic salt solution. ATP, ADP, AMP, and Pi were de￾termined by chromatography on PEI-cellulose plates, devel￾oped with 650mmol/L KH2PO4 pH 3.0, as previously de￾scribed.15 After autoradiography, the spots were excised and 
counted by liquid scintillation. After the assays, the rings were 
dried and weighed.
Cell Culture and Calcification Assays
The isolation and culture conditions of rat thoracic aorta vas￾cular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) have been described pre￾viously.21 The VSMC were prepared and lysed as described.20
Briefly, cells were grown to confluence and used after an 
overnight quiescence. After the VSMCs were fixed with 100% 
methanol at –20°C for 5min and dried for 24h after washing 
3 times with water. For Pi-induced calcification, MEM was 
supplemented with Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4 phosphate buffer (pH 
7.4) to a final concentration of 2mmol/L Pi, and the culture 
medium was replaced every day during calcification treatments.
Calcium Quantification
To quantify the calcium, the lysed VSMCs were treated over￾night with 0.6 HCl at 4°C. The calcium content was then col￾orimetrically determined using a QuantiChrom Calcium Assay 
Kit (BioAssay Systems).
Data: Kinetic and Statistical Analyses
All experiments were repeated at least 3 times with similar 
results. Data are presented as the mean±SEM. The statistical 
significance was determined by a one-way analysis of vari￾ance followed by Tukey’s multicomparison test. The kinetic 
analysis of ATP/PPi hydrolysis and inhibition kinetics with 
ADP and several anticalcifying agents were fitted as previ￾ously described.22 A general Michaelis-Menten and one-site 
competition equations were used to calculate the kinetic pa￾rameters by iterative, nonlinear regression. The mean inhibi￾tory concentration (IC50) was also calculated by nonlinear re￾gression22 using a one-site competition equation. The inhibition 
constant (Ki) for ADP was then calculated indirectly using the 
following equation: Ki=IC50 /[1+(S/Km)]), where S is the con￾stant concentration of ATP (1μmol/L) and Km is the affinity 
constant of ATP.
Results
Functional Characterization of ATP and PPi Hydrolysis
Initially, normal rat aortas were analyzed to determine the 
abundance of ectonucleotidase mRNAs involved in extracel￾lular PPi and ATP metabolism. A previous study had shown 
significant expressions of eNPP1, eNPP3, eNTPD1, eNTPD3, 
TNAP, and 5NT in the aorta wall, but eNPP2 and eNTPD2 
were not detected.15 In the present study, the expressions of 
ectonucleotidase subtypes in the aortic wall were analyzed by 
quantitative PCR (Figure 1A). eNPP3, TNAP, and eNPP1 
RNAs were all expressed with similar abundance, while 
eNTPD1 was found to be expressed 7.1-fold more than eNPP1. 
Conversely, the expressions of 5NT and eNTPD3 RNAs were 
very low, namely 3.27- and 297-fold less, respectively, than 
eNPP1.
Next, we characterized the extracellular metabolism of ATP 
and PPi hydrolysis in the aortic wall. The hydrolysis of each 
of PPi and ATP was measured by incubating aortas with either 
5μmol/L of PPi containing 32PPi as a radiotracer, or with 
1μmol/L of ATP containing [γ32Pi]ATP as a radiotracer. In 
both cases, the 32Pi released during each hydrolysis was quan￾of ePPi in the aortic wall, and second, we checked the capac￾ity of ATP to prevent CPD by acting as a nucleoside-associat￾ed polyphosphate.
Methods
Chemicals and Inhibitors
All chemicals and inhibitors used in this study were obtained 
from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA). Fetal calf serum and min￾imal essential medium (MEM) were obtained from Invitrogen 
(Carlsbad, CA, USA). Radionucleotides (32PPi, [α32P]ATP, and 
[γ32P]ATP) were obtained from Perkin-Elmer (Madrid, Spain). 
Physiologic salt solution (pH 7.4) containing 0.5mmol/L CaCl2, 
1.1mmol/L NaH2PO4, 5.4mmol/L KCl, 0.8mmol/L MgSO4, 
137mmol/L NaCl, and 24mmol/L HEPES.
Animals and Isolation of the Aorta
Male Sprague-Dawley rats (2–3 months old) were obtained 
from Charles River Laboratories (Barcelona, Spain). All pro￾tocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use 
Committee at Zaragoza University and were followed accord￾ing to Directive 2010/63/EU and Recommendation 2007/526/
EC regarding the protection of animals used for experimental 
and other scientific purposes.
Aortas were perfused with saline and removed, followed by 
gentle removal of the adventitia. The endothelium was removed 
by gentle rubbing with a cotton swab. Aortic rings were cul￾tured in the physiologic salt solution to perform the hydrolysis 
assays, as previously described.15
RT-Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) Analysis of 
Ectonucleotidase Subtypes
The relative expressions of ectonucleotidase RNAs were per￾formed by real-time PCR using SYBR Green on a LightCycler 
1.5 (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany), following 
the manufacturer’s instructions for normalized calibration pro￾tocol. The primers used for amplification were: (1) eNPP1 
(NM_053535): 5’-AAGGTATGCCCAAGAAAGGAA-3’

acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein RNA as the endogenous ref￾erence.20,21
ATP and PPi Hydrolysis Assays
Aortas were incubated with 32PPi or [γ32P]ATP in a physiolog￾ic salt solution. Orthophosphate was separated from ATP and 
PPi as previously described.15 Briefly, 40μl of samples were 
mixed with 800μl of ammonium molybdate (to bind the ortho￾phosphate) in 0.75mol/L sulfuric acid. The samples were then 
extracted with 1.6ml of isobutanol/petroleum ether (4:1) to 
separate the phosphomolybdate from PPi and ATP. Next, 800μl 
of the organic phase containing phosphomolybdate and 400 μl 
of the aqueous phase containing ATP/PPi were removed to 
count the radioactivity. To analyze the product released during

1μmol/L.
We then studied the kinetic characterization of ATP hydro￾lysis inhibition by ADP. Aortas were incubated with 1μmol/L 
of ATP containing [γ32Pi]ATP as a radiotracer, in the presence 
of an increasing concentration of ADP. As shown in Figure 1D, 
ATP hydrolysis inhibition by ADP revealed a typical sigmoi￾dal shape, providing a Ki value of 546μmol/L. Given that ATP 
and ADP hydrolysis in the aorta shows a molecular ratio of 
1:0.79 (ATP:ADP), small amounts of ADP can always be ob￾served during ATP hydrolysis in the aorta.
ATP Product Analysis
In order to analyze the presence of ADP during the hydrolysis 
of ATP, aortas were incubated with 1μmol/L ATP containing 
[α32Pi]ATP as a radiotracer. The release of ADP, AMP, and Pi 
during ATP hydrolysis was quantified after separation using 
thin-layer chromatography. As shown in Figure 2, after 20min 
of incubation, 50% of the ATP that was present was hydro￾lyzed in the form of ADP (10%), AMP (30%), and Pi (10%). 
Moreover, after 100min of incubation, most of the ATP was 
hydrolyzed, AMP was still present (25%), and ADP was not 
detected. These findings show that the hydrolysis of ATP/ADP 
via apyrase activity is faster than AMP hydrolysis via 5NT 
activity and that AMP is the major product of ATP hydrolysis 
tified by Cherenkov counting (Figures 1B,C). In a previous 
study, the hydrolysis of PPi and of ATP was shown to be lin￾ear for at least 2h or for 20min, respectively, with a linear 
regression rate of 1.27±0.05 and 17.4±0.41pmol·mg–1 ·min–1
for PPi and ATP, respectively.15 In this study, the hydrolysis 
of PPi and ATP in the aorta was characterized by using a satu￾rating Michaelian approach with 10min of incubation time. 
As shown in Figures 1B and 1C, analyses of the Pi released 
by hydrolysis of PPi and of ATP revealed saturating relation￾ships, with apparent Michaelis-Menten constants (Km) of 179 
and 435μmol/L, respectively. The maximal velocity (Vmax) or 
capacity of the hydrolysis systems was 55.1 and 6,177nmol·
g–1 ·min–1, respectively.
According to these kinetic parameters, we obtained a theo￾retical PPi concentration in equilibrium under different ATP 
concentrations, using the following equation:
X*((VmaxATP.[ATP])/([ATP]+KmATP))=
((VmaxPPi.[PPi])/([PPi]+KmPPi)) (Eq. 1)
where [ATP] and [PPi] are the concentrations of ATP and PPi 
in equilibrium, and X is the percentage of ATP that releases 
PPi in the aorta upon hydrolysis (7.5%, according to a recent 
study).15 Using equation 1, we obtained a PPi concentration of 
3.5μmol/L in equilibrium, with an ATP concentration of

Effect of the R Size Chain of Bisphosphonates on the 
Prevention of CPD
Finally, we analyzed the effect of different bisphosphonates 
(nonhydrolyzable analog of PPi) to check the effect of the R 
size chain on CPD inhibition. Four bisphosphonates were used 
in this study; all of them have a hydroxyl group (-OH) in the 
R1 position23 and different chain types in the R2 position 
(Figure 4A): -CH3 (for etidronate), -CH3-CH2-NH3 (for pami￾dronate), -CH3-(CH2)2-NH3 (for alendronate), and -CH3-
(CH2)4-NH3 (for neridronate). As shown in Figure 4, the IC50
values obtained for Pi-induced calcium deposition were 1.16, 
1.66, 2.07, and 2.37μmol/L for etidronate, pamidronate, alen￾dronate, and neridronate, respectively. The results showed a 
clear relationship between the length of the R chain in the 
P-C-P carbon and the efficiency of inhibiting Pi-induced cal￾cium deposition (IC50 value), which should be considered in 
future drug designs.
Discussion
During the past 2 decades, several mechanisms of the initia￾tion and progression of VC have been suggested, thereby solv￾ing different parts of a complex puzzle.24 These mainly in￾clude calcium and phosphate homeostasis; the loss of inhibition 
of VC; and the apoptosis and osteochondrogenic differentia￾tion of VSMC.25–27 Several inhibitors have been involved in 
the prevention of VC (ie, fetuin a, osteopontin, osteocalcin, 
matrix Gla-proteins).24 However, PPi is the major inhibitor of 
VC that directly blocks the CPD. The objective of the present 
study was to study ATP hydrolysis as a source of PPi and its 
ability to directly prevent CPD as a nucleoside-associated poly￾phosphate.
Several enzymes involved in extracellular ATP hydrolysis 
under these experimental conditions. In particular, linear re￾gression of the products released during ATP hydrolysis showed 
rates of 0.61±0.02, 2.00±0.09, and 0.48±0.01 for ADP, AMP, 
and Pi, respectively (Figure 2C).
Direct Inhibition of CPD by ATP and ADP
The prevention of VC using PPi and polyphosphates5,8 was 
demonstrated more than 40 years ago. However, to our knowl￾edge the possibility that nucleosides 5’-di- and -triphosphates 
also act as direct inhibitors of CPD has never been addressed. 
In this study, we analyzed whether the polyphosphates associ￾ated with nucleotides (nucleotide-associated polyphosphates) 
were able to inhibit CPD in a model of passive CPD.9,20
First, we used the 3 phosphorylated species of nucleoside 
(nucleoside 5’-mono-, -di-, and -triphosphates) and the un￾phosphorylated form as a negative control. In this study, we 
used Ado as the model of (poly)phosphate-containing nucleo￾sides, because this is the major nucleoside that accumulates 
extracellularly. Moreover, we used 2 nonhydrolyzable ATP 
analogs (αβ-methyl-ATP and βγ-methyl-ATP) and triphos￾phate. It has been shown recently that CPD is completely in￾hibited by a concentration of 50μmol/L PPi.20 Moreover, and 
as can be seen in Figure 3A, triphosphate, nucleoside 5’-di￾and triphosphate (ADP and ATP), and both of the nonhydro￾lyzable ATP species also completely inhibited CPD at the same 
concentration. Conversely, 5’-mono-phosphate and the unphos￾phorylated form (ADP and Ado) had no effect on CPD.
To support these findings, we compared the kinetic behav￾ior of Pi-induced CPD prevention by the different hydrolyz￾able and nonhydrolyzable “polyphosphate” agents. As shown 
in Figure 3B, the effect by triphosphate on Pi-induced calci￾um deposition resulted in a mean inhibitory concentration (IC50) 
of 0.13μmol/L, which is 66-fold lower than PPi (EC50=8.8
μmol/L).20 Moreover, the effect of ATP and ADP on Pi-in￾duced calcium deposition resulted in IC50 values of 3.2 and 
13.7μmol/L, respectively (Figure 3C). Similarly, the IC50 pa￾Figure 4.  Effect of the R sized chain of bisphosphonates on the inhibition of CPD. Molecular structure of several bisphosphonates

lecular ratio of approximately 1:0.8. The ratio is nevertheless 
not compatible with eNTPD3 activity, which exhibits a mo￾lecular ratio of 1:0.3.28 This finding is supported by our quan￾tification of eNTPD3 mRNA levels in the aortic wall, which 
showed a much lower expression than eNTPD1 (≈2,000-fold 
less, Figure 1A), and it is supported by the small amount of 
ADP found during ATP hydrolysis (Figure 2).
Pericellular and extracellular ATP concentrations are in the 
μmol/L range (10–6–10–5mol/L) and nmol/L range (10–9–10–7
mol/L), respectively.29 Therefore, we can speculate that the 
theoretical ePPi concentration in equilibrium in the rat aorta 
would be approximately 0.4–3.5μmol/L (for an ATP concen￾tration range of 0.1–1μmol/L),30 in accordance with equation 
1 and our kinetic parameters. Therefore, CPD in the aorta10
can be completely inhibited by this range of ePPi concentra￾tion under normal calcium and phosphorus conditions (ac￾cording to a recent study31), but not under Pi-induced calcifica￾tion conditions.9,20
Conclusions
We have shown that ATP is an inhibitor of Pi-induced calcium 
deposition (Figure 3C), with an IC50 value that is 2.8-fold 
lower than that of PPi. Therefore, ATP plays an important role 
in the prevention of VC, not only as the source of PPi but also 
as a direct inhibitor of CPD. Based on these results, new thera￾peutic strategies could be designed in the coming years, such 
as injections of exogenous PPi6,7 and ATP in combination with 
ALP inhibitors.32,33

On the one hand, the ALP and 5NT families are involved in 
the hydrolysis of phosphoric-monoester bonds,1,4 with the re￾lease of R-OH and phosphate (EC 3.1.3.-). Moreover, ALP 
can also hydrolyze PPi to Pi. In addition, 2 families of hydro￾lases act on phosphorus-containing anhydrides (EC 3.6.1.-), as 
the chemical bond existing between 2 phosphates:2,3 (1) the 
E-NTPD family (NTPDase 1–3) hydrolyzes ATP to ADP+Pi 
or AMP+2Pi, sequentially; and (2) the eNPP family (eNPPase 
1–3) hydrolyzes ATP to AMP+PPi. The eNTPD and eNPP 
families do not use AMP as a substrate, because they cannot 
hydrolyze the phosphate-ribose bond. Conversely, ALP and 
5NT can hydrolyze AMP, with the release of Ado and Pi.
Recent studies have reported significant expressions of eNPP1, 
eNPP3, eNTPD1, 5NT, and TNAP in aortic VSMCs15,17
(Figure 5). Moreover, eNPP1 activity is the main source of 
PPi via ATP hydrolysis in the aorta,15 and the authors of those 
studies have proposed that PPi can be hydrolyzed via the ac￾tivity of eNPP3 under physiologic conditions. Those previous 
works also showed that Pi is the major product released during 
the hydrolysis of 1μmol/L ATP in the aorta and that PPi con￾stitutes only 7.5% of the total released.15 Moreover, the hydro￾lysis of 1μmol/L ATP is 14-fold faster than the hydrolysis of 
5μmol/L PPi. Our findings are consistent with these data for 
2 reasons. First, quantitative PCR showed that the level of 
eNTPD1 mRNA was 9.2- and 7.1-fold higher than those of 
TNAP and eNPP1 mRNA, respectively (Figure 1A). Second, 
the kinetic parameters obtained in our study for both ATP and 
PPi hydrolysis in the aorta showed that the theoretical ratio of 
Pi released is 14.16 and 1.49nmol·min–1 ·g–1 for 1μmol/L of 
ATP and 5μmol/L of PPi, respectively (Figures 1B,C).
The apparent Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) obtained for 
ATP and ADP hydrolysis in our study showed a molecular 
ratio of 1:0.79. This ATP/ADP affinity is compatible with 
eNTPD1 activity, which hydrolyzes ATP and ADP at a mo￾Figure 5.  Proposed model for the role of ATP in the pre￾vention of vascular smooth muscle calcification. ATP is re￾leased into the extracellular matrix via different transporters.34
ATP and PPi inhibit the formation of calcium phosphate de￾posits. ATP is degraded via eNTPD1 (releasing 2×Pi and 
AMP) or via eNPP1 (releasing PPi). ATP, adenosine-5’-triphos￾phate; ADP, adenosine-5’-diphosphate; AMP, adenosine-5’-
