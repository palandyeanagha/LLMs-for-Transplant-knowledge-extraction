Abstract
Medical research is developing an ever greater need for comprehensive high-quality data generation to realize the promises
of personalized health care based on molecular biomarkers. The nucleic acid proximity-based methods proximity ligation
and proximity extension assays have, with their dual reporters, shown potential to relieve the shortcomings of antibodies
and their inherent cross-reactivity in multiplex protein quantification applications. The aim of the present study was to
develop a robust 96-plex immunoassay based on the proximity extension assay (PEA) for improved high throughput
detection of protein biomarkers. This was enabled by: (1) a modified design leading to a reduced number of pipetting steps
compared to the existing PEA protocol, as well as improved intra-assay precision; (2) a new enzymatic system that uses a
hyper-thermostabile enzyme, Pwo, for uniting the two probes allowing for room temperature addition of all reagents and
improved the sensitivity; (3) introduction of an inter-plate control and a new normalization procedure leading to improved
inter-assay precision (reproducibility). The multiplex proximity extension assay was found to perform well in complex
samples, such as serum and plasma, and also in xenografted mice and resuspended dried blood spots, consuming only 1 mL
sample per test. All-in-all, the development of the current multiplex technique is a step toward robust high throughput
protein marker discovery and research.

Introduction
There is a continuous need for new, and better, blood-based
biomarkers to develop minimally invasive tools for screening and
diagnostic purposes. Several studies have also demonstrated that
higher power of discrimination can be obtained by combining
more than one biomarker [1,2,3,4]. This demands the use of
multiplex techniques for high-throughput. Several immunoassays,
such as bead-based and planar arrays, used to quantify multiple
proteins are currently available. These methods require extensive
optimizations to eliminate antibody cross-reactivity [5]. This
drawback increases the development time for new assays and
limits the multiplexing level to around ten due to the exponential
increase in possible cross-reactive events with a higher degree of
multiplexing.
The proximity ligation assay (PLA) and, more recently, the
proximity extension assay (PEA) have been developed as
homogenous immunoassays shown to be both sensitive and
specific [6,7,8]. PEA is based on pairs of antibodies that are
linked to oligonucleotides having slight affinity to one another
(PEA probes). Upon target binding the probes are brought in
proximity, and the two oligonucleotides are extended by a DNA
polymerase forming a new sequence that now acts as a unique
surrogate marker for the specific antigen [6,7]. This sequence is
typically quantified by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), where
the number of PCR templates formed is proportional to the initial
concentration of antigen in the sample.
Immunoassay robustness and precision are crucial for imple￾mentation in research and routine diagnostics. By virtue of the
proximity requirement for template formation and the stringency
attained from the qPCR readout, antibody cross-reactivity is
unlikely to be detected and cause problems in PEA. Therefore we
postulated that PEA would be more scalable compared to
traditional immunoassays [9]. In the present paper we present
the development of a 96-plex PEA-based immunoassay and report
its performance upon the simultaneous measurement of 92 known
or putative protein biomarkers for cancer. Multiplexing did not
bring about any unspecific antibody binding events or any other
type of assay interference and, thus, both a high assay sensitivity
and specificity was maintained throughout the assay panel. With

the current data we put forward the 96-plex PEA immunoassay as
an approach to facilitate a systematic and flexible exploration of
protein profiles in body fluids, such as serum or plasma. We have
also successfully performed multiplex PEA analyses of dried blood
spots and sera from xenografted mice, two applications where low
sample consumption is critical.
Materials and Methods
Antigens, Antibodies, DNA Polymerases, and other
Reagents
Recombinant antigens were resuspended to 100 mg/mL in PBS
with 0.1% BSA and pooled either in sub mixes of 10 or 20, or in a
mix containing all of the antigens with the exception of CA125
and CA242 that were excluded due their origin in human cells/
tissue and the resulting risk of contaminating proteins (Table S1).
Antibodies, either matched monoclonal antibodies (mAb) or a
polyclonal antibody (pAb) batch split in two, were resuspended at
1 mg/mL in PBS. All antibodies were purchased from commercial
sources. For the IL-6 assays used for Figure S1 and Table S2, the
following antibody (Ab) combinations were used: A mAb/B mAb:
A = no. MAB206, clone 6708 (RnD Systems), B = no. 554541,
clone MQ2-13A5 (BD Pharmingen); A mAb/B pAb: A = no.
MAB206, clone 6708, B = no. AF-206-NA (RnD Systems); A
pAb/B mAb: A = no. AF-206-NA, B = no. 554541, clone MQ2-
13A5; A pAb/B pAb: A/B = no. AF-206-NA.
The hyper-thermostable DNA polymerases; Pwo Hypernova
(DNA Gdansk), Pfu (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham,
MA), TLA (Bioneer, Daejeon, South Korea), Pwo Delta3 (DNA
Gdansk), KOD exo+, KOD exo2 (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan), and
DreamTaq (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc) were evaluated at 0.5
units per reaction with the following thermocycling protocol:
10 min room temperature (RT) incubation, 23 min extension at
RT/37uC/45uC, 10 min denaturation at 85uC.
Dilution series of bilirubin (Sigma-Aldrich) and intra-lipid
(Fresenius Kabi, Uppsala Sweden) were prepared by making
two-fold dilutions in H2O ranging from 200–6300 mg/mL and 3–
200 mg/mL, respectively. When added to human serum samples
the final concentrations were between 20–630 mg/mL bilirubin
and 0.3–20 mg/mL intralipid. Hemolysate samples were prepared
at final concentrations ranging from 0.23–15 g/L, where 15 g/L
corresponds to complete lysis of 10% of all blood cells in a sample.
Two whole heparinized blood samples (27 mL at Hb 159 g/L)
were spun in 50 ml Falcon tubes at 3000 rpm, 10 min at 10uC,
without brake. Cell pellets were washed four times with 0.9%
NaCl, resuspended in H2O to the original volume, freeze-thawed,
vigorously mixed four times, pooled, and spun 5000 rpm, 20 min
at 10uC. The final Hb-value in the hemolysate stock solution was
estimated to 150 g/L.
Human serum samples were purchased from 3H Biological
(Uppsala, Sweden).
Generation of PEA Probes
PEA probes were generated using succinimidyl-4-(N-maleimi￾domethyl)cyclohexane-1-caroxylate (SMCC)-driven coupling of
two paired antibodies (specific for each target antigen) to unique
oligonucleotides (A and B) each comprising binding sites for
universal amplification primers and specific detection primers, one
site for pair-wise annealing between oligonucleotide A and B, and
one universal site for binding of molecular beacon and detection in
qPCR (Figure 1). The performance of all specific qPCR primers
has been evaluated by determining their amplification efficiencies.
Primers displaying ,80% efficiency were replaced.
Antibodies, either matched monoclonal antibodies (mAb) or a
polyclonal antibody (pAb) batch split in two, were resuspended at
1 mg/mL in PBS. A 40 kDa Zeba plate (Thermo Scientific,
Rockford, IL) was equilibrated four times with 100 mM phosphate
buffer, pH 7.3 (250 mL/well,10006g, 2 min). 20 mL antibody was
added/well, spun 10006g, 3 min, and collected in a new plate.
Sulfo-SMCC (Thermo Scientific) was dissolved to 3.33 mM in
100 mM phosphate buffer. 2 mL sulfo-SMCC was added to each
antibody well, mixed, and incubated at 4uC for 2 h with three
times intermittent mixing. A new 40 kDa Zeba plate was
equilibrated with 100 mM phosphate buffer with 20 mM EDTA.
The SMCC-treated antibodies were transferred to the Zeba plate
and spun at 10006g, 3 min. Conjugation protocols were
previously optimized to function well on both mAb and pAb.
Oligonucleotides synthesized with a 59-thiol modification
(Integrated DNA Technologies, Leuven, Belgium) were resus￾pended at 1 mM in 100 mM phosphate buffer with 20 mM
EDTA, and distributed in a 96-well plate in 1.3 mL. 2.2 mL
40 mM DTT (Life Technologies, Eugene, OR) was added to
1.3 mL of each oligonucleotide, mixed, and incubated at 95uC,
2 min, followed by a 1 h incubation step at 37uC. 20 mL PBS
buffer with 20 mM EDTA was added to the oligonucleotides and
excess DTT was removed using two consecutive 7 kDa Zeba
plates equilibrated with 100 mM phosphate buffer.
The SMCC-treated antibodies were mixed with the DTT￾treated oligonucleotides at 10x molar excess of oligo to Ab and
transferred to pre-wet Slide-A-Lyzer Mini 7 MWCO dialysis cups
(Thermo Scientific) and dialyzed in 1 L PBS with 5 mM EDTA at
4uC for two days with one buffer exchange to PBS. The PEA
probes were finally diluted to 75 mg/mL in a PBS buffer

containing 4 mM EDTA, 35 mg/mL ssDNA (Sigma-Aldrich),
0.1% fish gelatin, and 20 mM Tris HCl, and stored at 4uC.
Proximity Extension Analysis
One mL sample (buffer (PBS with 0.1% BSA), antigen-spiked
buffer, or biological sample) was mixed with 0.3 mL of each
proximity probe mix (A and B), 0.3 mL Incubation Stabilizer
(Olink Bioscience, Uppsala, Sweden) and 2.1 mL Incubation
Solution (Olink Bioscience) and incubated overnight at 4uC
(Figure 1A). A combined extension and preamplification mix
(96 mL) containing 10 mL MUX PEA Solution (Olink Bioscience),
0.5 units Pwo (DNA Gdansk, Poland), 1 mM forward + reverse
universal preamplification primers, and 1 unit hot-start DNA
polymerase was added to each reaction at RT. After mixing and a
total 5-min incubation, the plate was transferred to a thermocycler
(Applied Biosystem 2720) running an initial extension step to unite
the two oligonucleotides (50uC, 20 min), immediately followed by
a hot-start step (95uC, 5 min) and 17 cycles of amplification (95uC,
30 s; 54uC, 1 min; 60uC, 1 min) (Figure 1B). Amplification was
performed with universal flanking primers to amplify all 96
sequences in parallel (Figure 1C). Finally, 2.8 mL of the
preamplification products were mixed with 7.2 mL buffer
containing 5 mL MUX Detection Solution (Olink Bioscience),
0.071 units Uracil-DNA glycosylase (DNA Gdansk) used to digest
the DNA templates and remaining universal primers (Figure 1D),
and 0.14 units hot-start polymerase. Five mL from the sample mix
above was transferred to the sample inlet wells of a microfluidic
real-time PCR chip (96.96 Dynamic Array IFC, Fluidigm
Biomark). Five mL from respective well of an Assay Plate (Olink
Bioscience) containing 9 mM sequence-specific internal detection
primers, 2.5 mM molecular beacon in 1x DA Assay Loading
Reagent (Fluidigm) were transferred to the assay inlet wells
(Figure 1E). The chip was run in a Biomark instrument with the
following program: Thermal mix (50uC, 2 min; 70uC, 30 min;
25uC; 10 min), Hot-start (95uC, 5 min), PCR Cycle 40 cycles
(95uC, 15 s; 60uC, 1 min) according to the manufacturer’s
guidelines (http://www.fluidigm.com/biomark-hd-system.html).
Internal Spike-in Controls
Internal spike-in controls included in the incubation buffer
(incubation controls green fluorescent protein (GFP) and phyco￾erythrin (PE), extension control, and detection control) were
individually titrated to reach threshold cycle (Cq)-values between
12 and 15 (for robust measurements) and pooled. Resulting
concentrations during incubation were 16, 1, 0.235, and 0.077 pM
for GFP, PE, extension control, and detection control, respective￾ly. For evaluation, all samples analyzed on a single chip were
normalized against each of the different controls (linear value

sample/linear value normalizer), after which the % coefficient of
variation (CV) was calculated for the remaining three controls
across all samples. The extension control was chosen as the best
normalizer. For the Inter-Plate Control (IPC), concentrations were
between 1 fM and 100 fM for the individual controls during
incubation.
Data Analysis and Normalization
For each data point, the raw Cq-value (log2 scale) was
normalized by subtracting the Cq-value for the extension control
reaction for the corresponding sample, thereby correcting for
technical variation. The resulting delta Cq (dCq)-value was
compared to that of the corresponding background reaction
resulting in a ddCq-value, and used for most data presented
herein, either in log2 scale, or as linearized values (2ddCq). For the
interference data an additional data transformation step was
included where the average ddCq value for a sample was divided
with the value for 3 standard deviations (SD) of the corresponding
replicate (in the figure denoted as relative signal). This step is
performed simply for comprehensibility of the figure as it brings
the level for 63 SD for each assay to 61.
For LOD/LLOQ/ULOQ calculations, a 4-Parameters non￾Linear Regression analysis was performed on normalized protein
expression (NPX) values (background values and all values beyond
the plateau of the assay removed) using an algorithm of the
FourParameterLogisticCurve class in the Extreme Numerics
library (Extremeoptimization.com). Limit of detection (LOD)
was defined as 36SD above background. Lower limit of
quantification (LLOQ) and upper limit of quantification (ULOQ)
were defined as lowest and highest concentrations measured with
%CV,30 and relative error (RE) ,30%.
Xenograft Experiments
Three-to-four-week-old female NMRI-nude mice (Taconic,
Denmark) were housed in individually ventilated cages at a
research animal facility at Uppsala University (Uppsala, Sweden)
according to regulations. Human neuroblastoma cells (SK-N-FI)
were mixed at a 1:1 volume ratio with Matrigel (BD Biosciences,
San Diego, CA) and 106 cells were injected subcutaneously in the
right-hind flank in 100 mL. Before and 30 days after tumor
inoculation, 100–200 mL blood was collected from the tail vein
and serum was extracted using Microvette Capillary Blood
Collection System (Sarstedt, Numbrecht, Germany) and stored
at 280uC. A total of 18 mice were included in the study. The
Uppsala Animal Ethics Committee has approved the animal
studies (ID number C215/12).
Ethics Statement
The Uppsala Animal Ethics Committee has approved the
animal xenograft studies (ID number C215/12), and all guidelines
were followed. The mice were inspected every day and tumor sizes
were measured every second to third day. The mice were
sacrificed after blood collection by controlled exposure to
increasing concentration of CO2. After the mice had died cervical
dislocation was performed as an extra measure of security. It can
therefore not be considered as a standard survival study since the
experiment was terminated before any mouse’s health was put in
danger. No animal dies as a result of the intervention. According
to the research animal permit a mouse has to be euthanized if the
subcutaneous tumor reach a size above 10 mm in diameter or if
the tumor gets ulcerous. This was never the case in this study.
Anesthetics is not common use for subcutaneous tumor cell
injection or blood sampling. It was therefore not used.
Dried Blood Spot Experiments
Blood was sampled by venipuncture and transferred into EDTA
sample tubes. Tubes were inverted 10x directly after sampling.
Tubes were stored and transported in an upright position in a dark
box at RT for 6 h. Tubes were inverted 10x after which 15 mL
was added to pre-marked circles on a Whatman DMPK-C card
(GE Healthcare). The blood droplets were allowed to hang from
the pipette tip and carefully touch the surface of the DMPK-C
card for smooth spreading. Immediately after the spotting
procedure 1.5 mL of EDTA blood from each sample tube was
transferred to 1.5 mL cryo vials and spun 10 min at 20006g.
Supernatants (plasma) were carefully transferred to new cryo vials
stored at 220uC. Dried blood spots (DBS)-cards were dried
horizontally over night at RT and placed in separate plastic zip￾lock bags together with a Minipax adsorbent packet (Sigma￾Aldrich) and stored at RT. After 12 d storage, a 1.2 mm Ø disks
were punched with a fixed 1.2 mm puncher and ejected into
separate wells of a 96-well PCR plate. Each disk contained
approximately the equivalent of 0.43 mL blood. Punching of a
blank filter disk was made in between to prevent unwanted
contamination between samples. For analysis purposes, blank disks
were run and used as background.
Results and Discussion
Oligonucleotide Redesign to Enable Higher Degree of
Multiplexing
PLA, and more recently PEA, were developed as sensitive
immunoassays to quantify proteins in small volumes of biological
samples [6,7,8], and stepwise multiplexed to a level of 24
[4,9,10,11]. As a step towards higher degree of multiplexing the
probe oligonucleotides (A and B) were redesigned to contain
binding sites for both universal (for preamplification) and specific
primers (for qPCR detection), one unique 5-base pair site for
pairwise annealing between oligo A and B, and one universal site
for molecular beacon binding for detection in qPCR (Figure 1A).
Even in the absence of antigen bringing matching probes
together, there will be probes in proximity due to random diffusion
in the sample. The ratio between incubation volume and extension
mix volume has been maximized in the protocol (4 to 100 mL) in
order to minimize the concentration of unbound probes at the
time of extension, and thereby reducing the background signal
which yields higher sensitivity. A unique annealing site was added
to each of the oligonucleotides to avoid non-matching probes to
bind each other, and thereby further enforce specificity as well as
reducing the number of background events. To test if the unique
hybridization site would lower unspecific background, a 96-plex
PEA was performed as described below but using mismatched
primer pairs in the qPCR readout. None of the mismatched
primer pairs gave any detectable qPCR signal, which verified the
stringency of the annealing site (Data not shown).
To be able to efficiently screen for new biomarkers, perform
protein expression profiling, and combine several biomarkers for
increased power of discrimination, high multiplexing level is
essential. Subsequent to the development of singleplex and 24-plex
PEA [8], we chose to increase the multiplexing to a level of 96, and
with a focus on cancer-related biomarkers. A set of 92 cancer￾related proteins were selected to form the PEA panel. The analytes
chosen included well-known cancer biomarkers (e.g. CA125,
CA242, CEACAM5), proteins known to be selectively increased in
cancerous tissue (e.g. AM, ErbB2, Fas), inflammatory proteins (e.g.
IL-6, IL-8, CD69), proteins involved in angiogenesis (e.g. VEGF,
EGF, HGF), as well as several exploratory proteins (Table S1).

For normalization purposes, four internal controls were
included: Two incubation controls use PEA probes to quantify
the non-human proteins phycoerythrin (PE) and green fluorescent
protein (GFP). These were used to for quality control to identify
possible outliers amongst the samples, and for evaluation of
normalization procedure as their endogenous levels in all samples
Figure 3. New preamplification and normalization protocols resulting in improved precision and sensitivity. The optimized 96-plex
PEA protocol (gray series) was used to analyze standard curves generated for (A) IL-8, (B) IP-10, (C) VEGF, and (D) IL-6 and the results compared that of
the initial singleplex PEA protocol (white series) (E) A new normalization procedure was introduced, which significantly reduced the inter-assay
precison from average 29 to 12%CV. Histograms show the distribution of CV% across 92 assays and 7 analyzed plasma/serum samples with (white), or
without (gray) IPC normalization.

is known to be zero. The extension control was an antibody linked
to both A and B oligonucleotides providing immediate proximity
independent of antigen binding. Finally, a detection control made
up of a fixed amount of a complete double-stranded template
amplicons monitored the variability in the preamplification and
qPCR steps. The extension control was found to most efficiently
reduce variation across different samples and was therefore chosen
as a normalizer in all data analysis herein (see Materials and
Methods).
94 pairs of analyte-specific PEA probes were generated
(including the two incubation controls), as described above, and
combined in pools containing either all of the A or B probes (for
the extension control and detection control there were no probes)
at 1.33 nM (Table S1; Figure 1A). Multiplexed proximity
extension assays where performed by first incubating 1 mL of a
sample with 3 mL of the proximity probe mix (containing both A
and B probes at 133 pM) at 4uC over-night in a standard PCR￾type microtiter plate. This allows for binding of the probes to their
respective target analytes (Figure 1B). Next, 96 mL of a proximity
extension/preamplification solution containing nucleotides, uni￾versal primers, and DNA polymerases was added at RT (described
in the paragraph below). The micro titer plate is placed in a PCR
thermocycler for the proximity extension to take place at 50uC
(Figure 1B) and then immediately goes into a preamplification
cycling program using the universal PCR primers amplifying all
the 96 different types of amplicons in parallel (Figure 1C). An
uracil-DNA-glycosylase (UDG enzyme was added to all samples to
digest remaining primers (Figure 1D). Each preamplification
reaction is finally transferred to a microfluidic qPCR chip along
with the respective target-specific primer pairs and a molecular
beacon for fluorescent monitoring and detection in each of the 96
samples across 96 assays simultaneously. Cq-values derived were
normalized as described above, and the resulting ddCq-value level
is proportional to the initial protein level in the sample (Figure 1E).
Improved Enzymatic Performance using a Hyper￾thermostable DNA Polymerase
PEA was initially developed as an immunoassay performed
without washing steps, which increased precision compared to
solid-phase assays [8]. However, the T4 DNA polymerase used to
unite the two PEA probes and digest unbound probes in the first
version of PEA is active at RT. Therefore, the addition of
extension/preamplification mix had to be performed in a pre￾heated thermocycler to avoid undesired background to form upon
the addition of the enzyme. For an assay to be useful in clinical
diagnostics, low experimental hands-on time and robustness are
important parameters. To meet these requirements, the PEA
protocol had to be significantly improved by reducing the number
of pipetting and incubation steps.
We therefore investigated a number of hyper-thermostable
DNA polymerases possessing low (or no) activity at RT, which
would allow bench-top addition of all reagents at RT, while being
sufficiently active at a higher temperature that also maintains the
antibody/antigen binding. To do this we tested seven different
enzymes (Pwo Hypernova, Pfu, TLA, Pwo Delta3, KOD exo+,
KOD exo2, and DreamTaq) with regards to their ability to
remain silent during RT addition (low background signal) while
being able to efficiently extend at either RT, 37uC, or 45uC (high
antigen-dependent signal). PEA probes specific for human IL-8
were used in the analysis, and 10 pM IL-8 was used as antigen.
This experiment revealed that three out of the seven enzymes, Pwo
hypernova, Pfu, and Pwo Delta3, were the least active during the
10 min RT addition/incubation in the sense that the background
in those reactions was similar to that of a reaction without enzyme.
These three enzymes performed relatively well at 20 min
extension at 37uC, resulting in a signal-to-noise value (dCq) of
4–6 (Figure 2A). When increasing the temperature further to
45uC, both Pwo Hypernova and Pfu gave a higher dCq-value
between 8 and 9. Pwo Hypernova was one of the most suitable
candidates, and selected for all subsequent experiments.
Next, we pinpointed the optimal time and temperature for the
extension reaction to reach the highest possible sensitivity. This
was done using a Veriti 96-Well Fast Thermal Cycler (Life
Technologies) that is built with independent temperature blocks,
and therefore allowed us to evaluate the extension reaction with a
temperature gradient. IL-8, IP-10, and CXCL16 assays were used
to measure 100 pM of antigen. Extension was performed at eight
different temperatures spanning between 40uC and 60uC, and
Figure 4. Demonstrating high specificity and scalability of 96-plex PEA. (A) Submixes of antigens were analyzed and demonstrated that the
different assays only responded to the submix containing the corresponding antigen and at signal-to-noise levels similar to that of the mix containing
all antigens. (B) Scalability was assessed by analyzing 24 PEA assays either in 24-plex or 96-plex, and the normalized levels plotted and compared in an
xy scatter. This demonstrated a Pearson correlation value (R) as high as 0.998.

samples were removed from the thermocycler after 5, 10, 20, or
40 min, after which all samples were preamplified and analyzed by
qPCR. Figure 2B–C shows the signal-to-noise (dCq) level for each
condition for the IL-8 and IP-10 assays, respectively. These data
suggested that 20 min extension at a temperature around 50uC
was optimal to achieve the highest sensitivity while retaining
robust signals in PEA. A CXCL16 assay was also evaluated in
parallel and showed similar results (Data not shown).
Improved Preamplification Protocol Resulting in
Increased Precision and Sensitivity
In the initial PEA protocol the DNA polymerase-driven
extension uniting the PEA probes and the preamplification were
performed in two consecutive steps, including a transfer of sample
with a generally low number of templates. Such a transfer is very
likely to introduce high stochastic variation. Therefore we merged
the two steps by simply mixing the reagents required for both
extension and preamplification, and run a combined thermocycler
protocol.
As the readout is performed with a microfluidic qPCR system
that measures only 7 nL reactions, a preamplification step had to
be performed to reach sufficient signal. A rule of thumb, according
to Fluidigm’s guide lines, is to use samples with sufficient numbers
of templates to get a Cq-value ,25 for good precision. We
estimated that at least 15 preamplification cycles were required to
reach such a high signal. However, a major drawback with using
multiple primer pairs in PCR is that there is often a bias between
different sequences resulting in improper quantification and poor
expression profiling of a set of analyzed biomarkers. In addition, a
sample containing very high levels of a certain protein, the
corresponding primer pair might be limited and, thus, the signal
would be saturated. To circumvent such a bias, and to enable
equal amplification of all target sequences, the proximity probe
oligonucleotides were redesigned to include binding sites for
universal preamplification primers. Also, by replacing two internal
tyrosines with 29-deoxy-Uridine bases, excess primers remaining
after preamplification could be efficiently removed with a Uracil￾DNA glycosylase (UDG). This removes unspecific background in
the qPCR readout. The UDG-driven primer removal was
carefully assessed with enzyme titration, and revealed no increase
in background due to remaining primers at the concentration
chosen (Data not shown). Thorough evaluation of amplification
efficiency has been performed on samples with varying protein
concentrations and different sequences demonstrating that the
present multiplex PCR protocol supported even and efficient
amplification above 17 cycles.
After the optimization work described above, including a new
DNA polymerase (Pwo Hypernova), RT addition of extension/
preamplification reagents, combined extension/preamplification
step, and utilizing universal primers in the preamplification, the
PEA protocol was evaluated for four different assays (IL-8, IP-10,
VEGF, and IL-6) and compared to data using the old PEA
protocol. Standard curves for each of the four assays are plotted in
Figure 3A–D. For most assays, there was an improvement of
dynamic range and sensitivity as well as intra-assay precision. To
evaluate the entire 96-plex panel with regards to critical
immunoassay parameters, dilution series of recombinant antigen
standards were generated in buffer and analyzed with PEA and a
4-Parameter Logistic (4PL) non-linear regression. Based on this
analysis, values for limit of detection (LOD), lower limit of
quantification (LLOQ), and upper limit of quantification (ULOQ)
for 89 assays were determined (Table S1). Altogether, the
sensitivity obtained for the different assays were comparable to
the corresponding ELISA from RnD Systems. Roughly half of the
Figure 5. Low interference in biological samples. To determine whether PEA was affected by interference, three known interfering substances
were spiked in plasma and measured by 96-plex PEA. No interference was seen with plasma containing (A) bilirubin or (B) intralipid, while a few
assays showed increased signal in plasma containing (C) hemolysate, most likely due to actual analytes leaking out from the disrupted blood cells.

assays showed similar, or better, sensitivity (Data not shown). This
is quite remarkable considering the fact that no optimizations of
individual incubation conditions have been performed in the
current PEA panel.
Inter-Plate Control Improves Precision between Different
Runs
The analysis procedure includes a step where each data point is
normalized to the extension control signal for the same sample.
This improves intra-assay precision by correcting for technical
variation. However, this normalization step does not handle
variation occurring between different runs. For large studies,
including multiple plates and chips, a lower inter-plate variation is
desirable. Therefore, we generated a new internal control termed
Inter-Plate Control (IPC). This was generated by conjugating goat
IgG to each of the 92 different oligonucleotide pairs (similar to the
extension control). The 92 different conjugates were individually
titrated to generate a Cq-value of around 12, and pooled. A new
normalization procedure was evaluated, where the IPC was added
as a sample in three positions on each PEA plate, and the median
value was calculated for each assay. The median values were
finally subtracted from all extension control-normalized dCq￾values. A set of plasma and serum samples (n = 6) was analyzed in
triplicates with PEA and run on 8 different Fluidigm chips (also
different incubations and users), after which inter-plate %CV was
calculated with or without IPC normalization. Figure 3E shows
that while intra-assay precision remains the same (8%), the
average inter-assay precision (reproducibility) improved from
29%CV (gray bars) to 12%CV (white bars) upon IPC-normali￾zation. This demonstrated that with the new IPC normalization
one can correct for variation on the assay level and compare data
derived from multiple runs. This allows multiplex PEA to be
utilized in studies with large sample cohorts. Following these
results we decided to introduce the additional step in the

normalization procedure, and coined the new term ‘‘Normalized
Protein Expression (NPX)’’, which refers to IPC-normalized data.
Demonstrating High Specificity and Scalability of PEA
Multiplexing of immunoassays is generally constrained because
of false positive signals generated by unspecific binding of
antibodies. One of the benefits of PEA and other proximity
probing techniques is the high specificity. This is brought about by
two things: proximal requirement of the antibodies to generate a
signal (similar to sandwich assays), and the use of specific primers
in the qPCR detection. As mentioned above, higher multiplexing
level is desirable for higher assay throughput in biomarker
screenings. The risk of unspecific events in any immunoassay
system is exponentially increased with the level of multiplexing.
Therefore, we decided to add a third level of specificity to the
system when increasing from 24- to 96-plex. This was done by
adding a unique 5-base pair long annealing site that prevented
non-matching probes to bind as described above.
To evaluate the specificity of the PEA, the 90 antigens where
divided into eight sub mixes comprising assays (by sequence ID) 1–
11, 12–22, 23–32, 33–42, 43–54, 55–64, 65–74, and 75–96,
respectively (Table S1). The response for each of the assays was
measured either against the different antigen sub mixes (Figure 4A,
light gray bars) or against the entire antigen pool (Figure 4A, dark
gray bars), all at 5 ng/mL. This showed that for each assay a
significant response was only seen with the antigen mix containing
the corresponding antigen. This experiment validated the high
specificity of the PEA.
Furthermore, the response detected for entire antigen pool was
similar to that of the antigen sub mix (Table S1). On average, the
difference in ddCq between the mix containing all antigens and
each sub mix was as low as 0.1 (equivalent to a 7% change in
signal), and with the highest difference observed for adrenome￾dullin at 0.8. These data demonstrate that the PEA scales well up
to 96-plex (Table S1). Scalability was further analyzed by
measuring the level of 24 analytes in a healthy plasma sample
either in 24-plex or in 96-plex PEA. This was done by generating
two different probe mixes. The results are presented in Figure 4B
as an xy-scatter plot demonstrating a next to perfect Pearson
correlation (R = 0.998; y = 1.044x20.808) between the two
versions of PEA, further supporting the scalability of the system.
As both monoclonal and polyclonal Abs were used to build the
multiplex PEA panel it was important to validate that different Ab
types would give similar quantifications of an analyte in biological
samples. Four different IL-6 assays were generated comprising
either mAb/mAb, mAb/pAb, pAb/mAb, or pAb/pAb and used
in a side-by-side comparison to measure and quantify IL-6 in three
EDTA plasma samples from healthy individuals. A 4-Parameters
non-Linear Regression analysis resulted in similar IL-6 concen￾trations (8–18% CV between the back-calculated concentrations
derived from the different assays) regardless of which Ab was used
to build the PEA assay (Figure S1 and Table S2). These data
further highlighted the high specificity of the multiplex PEA.
The fact that new PEA assays are being developed without
individual optimizations and that both pAbs and mAbs can be
used to generate probes and used together in the same multiplex
protocol makes development both flexible and rapid. As for all
immunoassays, antibody affinity is the most important and limiting
parameter for successfully setting up new PEA assays, where high
affinity provides both better sensitivity and dynamic range [12]. As
the multiplex assay includes 92 different antibody pairs of which
the majority are polyclonal we anticipate a very broad range of
affinities in the multiplex assay. However, the incubation
conditions have been optimized to function regardless of the
source/type of antibody used and for antibodies with different
affinities.
Taken together, the current study demonstrates high specificity
and scalability of PEA, and illustrates that the technique is likely to
work well even at multiplexing beyond 96-plex.
Function and Lack of Cross-reactivity in Biological
Samples
Normal and pathological human plasma samples contain a
number of endogenous interfering substances, such as heterophilic
antibodies possessing broad reactivity with antibodies of other
animal species, and are therefore likely to hamper the performance

precision was assessed in duplicate samples. Shown is the distribution of %CV across all assays for two individuals (gray and white). (B) EDTA DBS and
EDTA plasma samples from the same individual were analyzed. The normalized protein expression es (NPX) is shown as an XY scatter plot

of an immunoassay [13]. To evaluate the potential impact of this
specific interference, a special ‘‘mismatch’’ system was designed in
which the probe oligonucleotide A contained a modified 39-end to
allow annealing with a mis-matched probe oligonucleotide B. The
only way to generate a signal here is by mis-matching antibody
probe pairs being brought into proximity by cross-binding
substances other than antigens, e.g. heterophilic antibodies and
similarly acting rheumatoid factor. Six different mis-matched
probe pairs of varying antibody host species origins were designed
and evaluated with a Heterophilic Assessment Panel from
Scantibodies Laboratory Inc. (part no. 3KG027) containing
samples with varying confirmed levels of interfering substances.
No interference could be detected for any of the panel samples,
indicating a sufficient blocking ability during the incubation step
(Data not shown).
Other known serum and plasma components known to affect
immunoassay performance are hemolysate, lipids, and bilirubin.
Serial dilutions of these components were performed and added to
normal serum samples to represent different patient health
conditions and/or sample collection irregularities. The potential
impact of the different additions was assessed by performing PEA
on the modified samples and the results were compared to that of
normal sera. No interference was detected by addition of bilirubin
or intralipid even at concentrations of 300 mg/mL and 10 mg/
mL, respectively (Figure 5A–B). This showed that PEA performs
efficiently even in extreme conditions, such as hyperbilirubinemia,
percholesterolemia, and hypertriglyceridemia [14,15]. Further￾more, 7 out of 92 assays displayed a significant increase in signal
when adding 15 g/L hemolysate to the serum (Figure 5C). Such a
hemolysate level corresponds to complete lysis of 10% of all blood
cells in a sample (see Materials and Methods). The increase in
signal was observed only for a few assays and is most likely due to
actual analytes leaking out from the disrupted blood cells rather
than disturbance of the assay mechanism.
Detection of Human Proteins in Sera from Xenografted
Mice and in Human Dried Blood Spots (DBS)
Low sample consumption is of particular importance for studies
using small animal models. As mentioned above, PEA consumes
only minute amounts of samples - as little as one mL is enough to
detect and quantify 92 different proteins. The nude mouse is an
immune-compromised mouse model lacking T lymphocytes and is
utilized to study various cancer treatments as it mounts no
rejection response towards foreign cells [16]. A xenograft mouse
model was established in which female nude mice were grafted
with 56106 SKNFI human neuroblastoma cells subcutaneously in
the flank. Three to four weeks after tumor inoculation, mice were
bled and sera were prepared. Sera from normal nude mice and
xenografted mice were analyzed with PEA. This analysis identified
13 proteins (IL-8, GDF-15, PlGF, E-selectin, Cystatin B, MCP-1,
CSF-1, FAS, EMMPRIN, ErbB2/Her2, Midkine, U-PAR, MIC￾A, Prostasin) that were detected in xenografted mice while being
undetectable in normal mice (Figure 6A–D; Data not shown). The
plots present the detected protein levels in xenografted mice with
levels in normal human sera as a comparison. This showed that
proteins from the grafted human tumor cells efficiently leak out to
the circulation of the mouse and can be detected by PEA. Several
proteins (n = 30) were also detected in normal mouse sera (Data
not shown). This correlated well with reported antibody cross￾reactivity between mouse and man in most cases.
Dried blood spot testing (DBS) is a form of biosampling where
blood samples are blotted and dried on filter paper [17]. Capillary
blood, obtained from pricking the heel or finger and blotted onto
filter paper, is routinely used to screen for metabolic diseases in
large populations of newborns. The technology holds promise to
expand to diagnostic testing in resource-poor and rural areas due
to the long sample lifespan and easier transportation independent
of refrigeration [18].
One limitation with DBS samples when it comes to protein
analyses, however, is the very low sample volume. As low sample
consumption is one of the hallmarks of PEA, we applied the 96-
plex PEA to DBS analysis. EDTA plasma and EDTA DBS were
prepared in parallel from two healthy donors (see Materials and
Methods). From each DBS 1.2 mm Ø disks (spots) were excised
and transferred to a tube, after which 1 mL PBS, probes and
incubation solution were added, followed by a regular MUX PEA
protocol (as described above) with the disk remaining in the tube
until the qPCR step. Inter-spot precision (%CV) was determined
for duplicate spots, and for each assay. This demonstrated a very
high precision with an average of 4.3 and 6.4 CV% across all
assays. Figure 7A displays the distribution of precision for the two
DBS samples in a histogram. Next, we compared the signal
detected for each of the analytes and compared the results to that
of EDTA plasma. For some assays there was an increased level of
protein detected in EDTA DBS when compared to EDTA plasma
(Figure 7B). These included six analytes, IL-8, Cystatin B,
Galectin-3, CXCL11, Myeloperoxidase, and Caspase-3 (shown
as white circles), whose levels were significantly increased in
Hemolysate-containing serum in Figure 5. This experiment
revealed a correlation between protein expression levels deter￾mined in the two samples types (Pearson correlation = 0.75
calculated on all analytes excluding the six mentioned above).
This suggests that for some analytes there is an additional release
from the blood cells after addition to the paper, partly because of
cell disruption. In line with this, a previous study has demonstrated
a correlation between DBS and plasma when measureming
therapeutic mAb concentrations in monkeys [19]. The authors
also found a two-to-three-fold differences in detected levels,
possibly attributable to hematocrit or differences in recovery.
All-in all,our data demonstrate that the DBS sample format is
highly compatible with multiplex PEA.
DBS sampling requires minimal amount of blood, and is
therefore particularly well suited for infant screening by capillary
heel stick. A well working method to examine blood from
extremely premature infants could give unique information on
health related issues, which hopefully could result in increased
premature infant survival in the future. Such analysis relies on
accurate and highly multiplexed analyses on very limited sample
amounts, which makes the 96-plex PEA assay a possible candidate
for this demanding task. Besides minimal patient invasiveness,
DBS sampling is also very simple in terms of storage and
transportation. This makes DBS sampling well suited for home
testing for e.g. long-term follow up after treatment or health status
controls were the individual handles the sampling and sends the
DBS by regular mail for analysis and medical evaluation. Another
aspect to the DBS ease of sampling, storage and transportation are
screening for certain diseases, such as tuberculosis, that are
common in developing countries where resources and infrastruc￾ture are limited. The PEA technology is a suitable way to perform
quantitative analysis of protein markers from DBS samples, and
could possibly be applied to all areas discussed above.
Altogether, the DBS and xenograft studies both demonstrate a
good performance of multiplex PEA in biological samples. More
importantly, these are two applications that are compatible with
multiplex PEA when low sample consumption is critical.

Concluding Remarks
Rapid and scalable immunoassay development is desired to
increase knowledge of disease mechanisms and drug activity, and
holds promise for early disease detection [20]. The presented PEA
platform can be scaled to detect 92 proteins in 96 samples
simultaneously, opening up new opportunities for large-scale data
generation of protein biomarkers. PEA encompasses high speci￾ficity, high sensitivity, and low sample consumption - three
important immunoassay parameters. The minute sample con￾sumption makes PEA particularly valuable for studies using scarce
samples, such as fine-needle biopsies, cell lysates from precious
cells, and small model animals. Single-cell research is accumulat￾ing growing evidence of importance for understanding cancer
development, future drug development and for diagnostics aiming
to provide the right treatment to the responsive fraction of the
patient population [12]. Recently a nucleic acid proximity assay
was shown to quantify proteins even in isolated single cells [21]. As
the homogeneous PEA can scale in volume due to the absence of
solid support and have strong amplification of signal through
PCR, it is especially suited for large-scale single-cell analyses.
We envision the development of disease area-focused panels of
protein biomarkers with the thousands of commercially available
antibodies to be suitable for this purpose. As the specificity of
multiplex PEA is controlled at several levels, and the PEA is shown
to be scalable, we foresee no problems to further increasing the
level of multiplexing.
