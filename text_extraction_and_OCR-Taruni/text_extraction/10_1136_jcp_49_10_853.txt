Role of non-transferrin bound iron in iron
overload and liver dysfunction in long term
survivors of acute leukaemia and bone marrow
transplantation

Abstract
Aims-To determine whether non￾transferrin bound iron is present in the
serum oflong term survivors of acute leu￾kaemia and bone marrow transplantation
who have liver dysfunction as indicated by
consistently raised serum aspartate ami￾notransferase (AST) activities.
Methods-Thirty eight patients, who were
at least three years from the end of
treatment, were studied. Serum samples
were analysed for hepatitis C, hepatitis B,
AST, ferritin, and non-transferrin bound
iron. A bleomycin based assay was used to
detect non-transferrin bound iron. Pa￾tient and blood bank records were exam￾ined to determine the number of units of
transfused blood received by each patient.
Results-Ten patients had consistently
raised serum AST activities. Ofthese, two
had evidence of hepatitis C infection, one
had chronic hepatitis B infection and one
had chronic graft versus host disease
affecting the liver. None of these four
patients had detectable non-transferrin
bound iron. The remaining six patients
had no obvious reason for raised AST
activities, but four had non-transferrin
bound iron detectable in their serum as
compared with only two out of 28 patients
with normal AST activities. Patients with
abnormal AST activities had higher
serum ferritin concentrations than those
with normal AST, though serum ferritin
was raised in 21 of28 patients without liver
dysfunction.
Conclusion-Non-transferrin bound iron
may be found in this group of patients,
suggesting that iron overload is the cause
of the observed liver dysfunction. Non￾transferrin bound iron may also be a more
specific indicator ofiron overload than the
serum ferritin concentrations.

Keywords: liver dysfunction, non-transferrin bound

Liver dysfunction is a recognised finding
following treatment of haematological malig￾nancy and has a variety of possible causes
including: hepatitis B virus (HBV),' hepatitis C
(HCV),2 graft versus host disease (GvHD),3
and veno-occlusive disease (VOD) . The latter
is generally only seen soon after transplanta￾tion; however, the others can be responsible for
continuing liver damage years after the cessa￾tion of treatment. In addition, many chemo￾therapeutic agents used in the treatment of
haematological malignancies are known to be
hepatotoxic.5
Recently, it has been suggested that iron
overload is responsible for abnormal liver
blood tests in some patients surviving at least
one year after bone marrow transplantation
(BMT).6 It is possible that this may also be the
case in patients who have received chemo￾therapy alone for haematological malignancy.
It is known that in situations of iron overload
serum iron binding capacity becomes fully
saturated and that non-transferrin bound iron
complexes appear in the serum. Non￾transferrin bound iron is also described as free
iron. Serum ferritin is increased in this
situation, but ferritin functions as an
intracellular iron storage protein. Only trace
amounts of ferritin are present in the serum
and this is glycosylated and contains little or no
iron; it does not seem to function as an iron
scavenger.! Free iron or non-transferrin
bound iron has been reported in several condi￾tions including idiopathic haemachromatosis9
and following cytotoxic chemotherapy.'0 Non￾transferrin bound iron may mediate tissue
damage by the formation of highly reactive
hydroxyl radicals from superoxide and hydro￾gen peroxide."
The presence of non-transferrin bound iron
can be detected using a bleomycin based
assay.'2 Iron is required to bind to bleomycin in
the presence of ascorbate before it can cleave
DNA at G-C (5'-3') and G-T (5'-3')
sequences. If bleomycin, ascorbate and DNA
are in excess, the amount of DNA degradation
is proportional to the concentration of non￾transferrin bound iron.'2
In cases where iron overload is the cause of
abnormal liver blood tests following treatment
of haematological malignancy, we postulate
that serum non-transferrin bound iron should
be present. Additionally, in a population of
multitransfused patients non-transferrin bound
iron should be a better indicator of iron medi￾ated liver dysfunction than serum ferritin. In
such a population increased ferritin concentra￾tions may be found in many subjects without
liver dysfunction. Liver dysfunction can also
result in an increase in serum ferritin concen￾trations.13

Methods
All surviving patients treated within a single
unit for acute leukaemia or who underwent
BMT (autologous or allogeneic), and who
were at least three years from the end of treat￾ment, were identified and studied. Serum sam￾ples were assayed for aspartate aminotrans￾ferase (AST) activity. Ferritin was assayed by
microparticle enzyme immunoassay (Abbott
Diagnostics).
All samples were screened for HCV infection
by a third generation enzyme linked immuno￾sorbant assay (ELISA) (Ortho Diagnostics).

used to measure non-transferrin bound iron
has been described elsewhere.'0 Briefly, 0.4 ml
of DNA at 1 mg/ml (Sigma, Poole, Dorset,
UK), 50 gl bleomycin 0.6 mM (Lundbeck),
0.1 ml magnesium chloride 50 mM (BDH,
Poole, Dorset, UK), 0.1 ml Tris buffer, pH 7.4
(BDH), 50 pl ascorbate 7.5 mM (BDH), and
20 gl of sample or control were incubated in
clean plastic test tubes for 30 minutes at 37°C.
Then, 0.1 ml EDTA 0.1 M (BDH), 0.5 ml
thiobarbituric acid 1% w/v in 50 mM sodium
hydroxide (Sigma), and 0.5 ml hydrochloric
acid 25% w/v in distilled water (BDH) were
added and the mixture heated for five minutes
at 100°C to develop TBA (thiobarbituric acid)
reactivity. After cooling, the absorbance was
measured at 532 nm using a PU 8610 kinetics
spectrophotometer (Pye Unicam) and com￾pared with the appropriate standards and
blanks. The bleomycin assay used to measure
serum non-transferrin bound iron does not
measure iron bound to transferrin or ferri￾tin." 15
Individual medical and blood bank records
were examined to determine the number of
units of blood transfused during treatment and
to record all elevated AST activities. For the
purposes of this study an AST activity was
considered consistently raised if it was

those seen in patients with normal AST activi￾ties (p = 0.0055), 21 of the 28 patients with
normal AST activities also had a raised serum
ferritin concentration (range 103-2815 ng/ml).
We found no correlation between ferritin and
the presence of non-transferrin bound iron.
However, all patients with raised AST and
non-transferrin bound iron had ferritin con￾centrations of over 1000 ng/ml compared with
nine of the 28 patients with normal AST
activities. There was a moderate correlation
between ferritin concentrations and the
number of units of blood transfused (fig 1).
Those patients with raised AST activities
received a median of 49 units of blood (range
11-75) compared with a median of 25 (range
4-71) in those with normal AST activities (p =
0.037). The four patients with both non￾transferrin bound iron and raised AST had
received an median of 50 units (38, 38, 61, 75).
Discussion
It is well known that intensive treatment for
haematological malignancy can have signifi￾cant long term adverse effects. Well described
examples include cardiomyopathy due to
anthracyclines,'6 lung fibrosis due to bleomy￾cin,'7 cataracts following total body irradia￾tion,'8 and endocrine dysfunction, including
growth retardation, in children.'9 Liver damage
is also a recognised finding and, as already dis￾cussed, has several well described causes.
Drugs, especially cytotoxic agents, may cause
abnormal liver function by a variety of mecha￾nisms and this has been reviewed extensively.5
Chronic viral hepatitis is also a well recognised
complication and has been investigated exten￾sively.
In 1988 Hetherington and Buchanan20
noted a correlation between raised serum ami￾notransferase values and number of prior
blood transfusions in 59 children with acute
lymphoblastic leukaemia. They proposed
non-A non-B hepatitis as the likely cause rather
than, or in addition to, chemotherapy induced
hepatic injury. Iron overload was not consid￾ered as an explanation for the observed raised
aminotransferase activities.
Since the identification of HCV as the cause
of transfusion related non-A non-B hepatitis,
its impact in patients treated for haematologi￾cal malignancy has been explored in several
centres. In one study a group of 50 Italian chil￾dren with leukaemia (in long term remission)
and chronic liver disease was examined.2'
Twenty three (46%) of the children were found
to be HCV antibody positive. However, this
figure may be an underestimate as a result of
the use of a first generation EIA which may
have given false negative results. Iron overload
was not considered as a possible cause for the
chronic liver disease in the remaining 27 (54%)
patients. In a more recent Italian study2 inves￾tigating the prevalence of HCV infection in
patients receiving treatment for acute lym￾phoblastic leukaemia, 21 of 102 children had
raised aminotransferase activities. Of these, 16
had evidence of HCV infection (using a RIBA
III and RT-PCR) and five did not; again iron
overload was not regarded as a possible expla￾nation for the raised aminotransferases in those
without HCV infection. In our study the rate of
HCV infection was low (5%) and reflects the
low prevalence in the local donor population
(0.028% in 1991; unpublished data) as com￾pared with other areas-for example, 1.3% in
Italy22 and 0.11 % in Finland.23
Iron overload is a well recognised cause of
liver damage. Indeed, hepatic dysfunction is
one of the most frequent findings in idiopathic
haemachromatosis. Iron overload due to both
haemachromatosis and multiple blood transfu￾sion results in the saturation of transferrin and
the appearance of non-transferrin bound iron
in the serum.24 Non-transferrin bound iron is
toxic to living systems because it can act as a
catalyst in the formation of highly reactive
hydroxyl radicals, which in turn stimulate lipid
peroxidation in membranes.24 Iron bound to
ferritin and transferrin is not reactive in this
way.25 It has been shown previously that in
patients with leukaemia non-transferrin bound
iron is only detected when transferrin is fully
saturated, and that there is no significant
association between serum ferritin and the
presence of non-transferrin bound iron.'0
Finding non-transferrin bound iron in four
out of six patients with an unexplained increase
in AST activity leads us to suggest that not only
is iron overload responsible for the liver
dysfunction, but that non-transferrin bound
iron is a more specific indicator of this than
serum ferritin. The latter was raised in most of
our patients following treatment for haemato￾logical malignancy, whilst only 16% had unex￾plained increases in AST. The presence of
non-transferrin bound iron in patient 5 (table
3) is difficult to explain, but may be a false
positive result due to contamination. This
patient, with a normal serum ferritin concen￾tration, received relatively few red cell transfu￾sions and has never had a raised AST activity.
Our findings support those of McKay et al,6
that iron overload has a causal role in liver dys￾855Protected by copyright, including for uses related to text and data mining, AI training, and similar technologies. . Technical Services Serials

function following BMT. We have also shown
that this may apply to patients treated with
standard chemotherapy for acute leukaemia.
We also agree with McKay et al5 that the role of
venesection in these patients needs assessing,
and that iron overload should be considered in
any patient with persistently abnormal liver
blood tests following treatment for haemato￾logical malignancy. We are currently assessing
the role of venesection in such patients. In
a
population of patients with raised ferritin con￾centrations, the bleomycin assay for non￾transferrin bound iron may offer a relatively
simple method of identifying patients with iron
induced liver damage. 1 Armitage JO, Burns CP, Kent TH. Liver disease complicat￾ing the management of acute leukaemia during remission.
