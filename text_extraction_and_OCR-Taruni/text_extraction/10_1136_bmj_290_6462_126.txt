Abstract
Over 20 years 42 of 138 patients with systemic lupus erythemato￾sus "died"-that is, suffered actual death or went into terminal
renal failure, or both; data from 41 were available for analysis. In
most patients the causes of death were multiple. Twenty seven
patients went into terminal renal failure, of whom 25 were offered
dialysis treatment. Three regained renal function later, 12 sur￾vived on dialysis or with functioning kidney allografts-almost ali
with inactive lupus-but 13 died after starting dialysis, most
within a few weeks or months. The principal causes were active
lupus or infection. In those patients with renal failure after rapid
deterioration in renal function (n=14) there were nine deaths,
while of 10 patients with a slow evolution into renal failure, only
four died.
Four patients with impaired and 10 with normal renal function
died, again most often from complications of lupus or from
infection. Vascular disease was a major cause of death in seven
patients, all but two of whom were young; of 15 postmortem
examinations, eight showed severe coronary artery atheroma,
and three surviving patients required coronary bypass opera￾tions. Analysis of the timing of death or entry into renal failure
showed that in 12 out of 13 patients who died within two years of
onset the lupus was judged to be active, while this was true in only
eight out of 19 patients who died later. Six of the seven vascular
deaths occurred later than two years from onset, while only nine
of 26 renal "deaths" occurred before two years; deaths from
infections (n=13) were distributed equally. Despite this and
aggressive treatment of active disease, the principal cause of
actual death was uncontrolled lupus.
Introduction
There is considerable information on causes of death in systemic
lupus erythematosus. 1-16 Even in series reporting the whole range of
lupus, with or without evident renal disease, renal failure emerges as
an important cause of death. Equally, patients with lupus nephritis
may fall victim to other manifestations of lupus, to complications of
treatment, or to associated features such as vascular disease. The
problem has been complicated further by the availability of substi￾tution therapy for renal failure in the form of dialysis and trans￾Renal Unit and Evelina Department of Paediatrics, Guy's Hospital, London

plantation. Patients surviving renal failure oflupus nephritis remain
at risk from fatal disease in other organs caused by the lupus. Thus
even though we have data on causes of death in lupus, many of these
data do not apply to patients with nephritis as the principal clinical
feature, and the impact of substitution therapy has been taken into
account in very few series.
The fate of patients requiring renal replacement therapy because
of lupus nephritis has been described,'"2 and we have detailed our
own experience elsewhere." The purpose of this paper is to examine
the overall pattern of mortality in our patients suffering from lupus,
all of whom had prominent renal disease, in order to assess the
relative roles of extrarenal lupus and complications of treatment in
determining mortality when compared with renal failure itself.
Patients and methods
Between 1964 and 1982, 138 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus
were referred to the renal unit at Guy's Hospital. All satisfied the preliminary
(1971) and 1982 criteria of the American Rheumatism Association23 and all
had on at least one occasion (usually many) a positive antinuclear factor
preparation or a raised binding capacity for double stranded DNA, or both,
in serum. All had clinical evidence of nephritis, with proteinuria or abnor￾malities of the urinary sediment, and all had undergone renal biopsy at some
time yielding histological evidence of lupus nephritis. After assessment and
planning of treatment some of the patients returned to the care of the
referring centre, but most were followed up in the renal unit, either solely or
jointly with the referring physician.
During follow up, varying from two to 22 years (mean 8 4 years), 42 of the
patients (30 4%) either died or entered end stage renal failure, events which
together are referred to as "death" (since patients reaching end stage renal
failure would have died but for substitution therapy, so that the patients who
in fact survived by virtue of dialysis or transplantation were for actuarial
analysis regarded as dead). One patient was excluded from the study because
there was insufficient information on her death, which occurred elsewhere.
CAUSES OF DEATH
Since in nearly all cases death resulted from several factors, we did not
attempt to ascribe a single main cause for each patient. Instead we classified
the causes of death under six headings.
Active generalised lupus was defined as progressive spread of the disease to
several systems, causing severe dysfunction with immunological or histo￾logical evidence of disease activity.
Active lupus, single organ was defined as progressive spread of the disease to
affect one major organ, causing severe dysfunction without evidence or with
only minor disruption of other systems, with immunological or histological
evidence of disease activity.
Inactive lupus was defined as evidence of previous organ damage causing
dysfunction but with no signs of continuing clinical or immunological
activity at the time of death.
Vascular was defined as clinical or histological evidence of major life
threatening occlusion of coronary, cerebral, or peripheral circulation.
Infection was defined as major infection(s) which contributed to or caused
the death of the patient.
Other, unrelated was defined as other causes of death not related to
systemic lupus erythematosus or its treatment.
Disease of the kidney caused by systemic lupus erythematosus presents a

special problem in classifying causes of death because of the possibility of
replacement therapy. Lupus nephritis (classified as above) was considered as a
cause of death if the patient died within one month of reaching end stage
renal failure, by which time the effects of renal failure would not have been
corrected in a stable fashion by dialysis or transplantation.
ACTIVITY OF SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS BEFORE AND AT DEATH
In analysing the activity of systemic lupus erythematosus before and at
entry into end stage renal failure renal damage by systemic lupus erythema￾tosus was considered similarly to active lupus affecting other organs.
Clinically "active" lupus nephritis was recorded as present if there was (a)
proteinuria or active urinary sediment with (b) extrarenal manifestations of
lupus activity, even if minor and not life threatening, such as skin or joint
disease, together with (c) immunological or histological evidence of activity.
Histological appearances of renal biopsy or necropsy specimens were
judged to be "active" when fresh cellular crescents, diffuse or focal active
proliferation of endocapillary cells, tuft necrosis, capillary thrombosis, or
vasculitis was visible.
Immunological evidence of disease activity was defined as low serum con￾centrations of C3 (<55% normal) and C4 (<50% normal), a raised binding
titre of serum deoxyribonucleic acid (>30 [tm), or (when available) the
presence of excess amounts of immune complex like material in the serum.
RATE OF DETERIORATION IN RENAL FUNCTION
For analysis the patients were divided into (a) those with rapid deteriora￾tion in renal function, defined as a fall in glomerular filtration rate of 40
ml/min or more or a rise in plasma creatinine concentration of 500 [tmol/l
(5 7 mg/100 ml) or more in the three months before end stage renal failure,
and (b) those with slow deterioration if less than this.
TIMING OF "DEATH"
Patients who suffered true death or went into end stage renal failure were
divided into those with early death or renal failure, defined as occurring less
than two years after onset of systemic lupus erythematosus, and those with
late death, when the interval was greater than this.
STATISTICAL
Analysis of dependency in two way tables was performed using the G test
with Yates's correction for small samples.24
Results
There were 36 female and five male patients in the study, with a mean age
at death of 35-8 years (range 11-63). Those who went into renal failure but
did not die were of almost identical age (mean 35-4 years; range 11-63).
Eight were of West Indian origin, two west African, two Arab, two Chinese,
one Pakistani, one Iranian, one Greek, and 24 of resident British stock.
FINDINGS AT AND BEFORE DEATH OR RENAL FAILURE
Tables I and II show the circumstances of "death" of the 41 patients.
Twelve patients (cases 1-12; table I) who went into end stage renal failure
received renal substitution therapy and survived. Of these, at last follow up
four had functioning renal cadavericallografts, six were receiving dialysis,
and two (cases 11 and 12) had recovered sufficient renal function to survive
without dialysis; one patient (case 10) had a temporary recovery of renal
function.
Fifteen patients (cases 13-27) went into end stage renal failure and sub￾sequently died (table II). Two (cases 13 and 14) were not offered substitution
therapy; one was paraplegic and the other demented. The remaining 13
patients began dialysis. Three patients (cases 24, 26, and 27) died after more
than one month of dialysis, and the other 10 died within one month of
beginning dialysis, most commonly from active lupus. The remaining 14
patients (cases 28-41; table II) died from extrarenal causes, 10 with normal or
near normal renal function (cases 32-41) and four with moderate chronic
renal failure.
Tables III and IV analyse the causes of the true deaths in detail. In the 10
patients who died shortly after beginning treatment for end stage renal
failure (cases 15-23 and 25) the causes of death were mainly active systemic
lupus erythematosus and infection. The three patients who died more than
one month after beginning treatment did so because of recurring manifesta￾tions of lupus in the central nervous system after three months of haemo￾dialysis (case 24), gastrointestinal bleeding during a rejection episode one
and a half months after transplantation and an initial month on haemo￾dialysis (case 26), and myocardial infarction five years after transplantation,
with good graft function (case 27). Infection was the single commonest cause
of death in those with functioning kidneys (table IV).
ANALYSIS OF DEATHS IN RELATION TO COURSE OF DISEASE
Causes of "death" as classified in tables I-III were analysed in terms of the
duration of the disease and the effect on the kidneys (renal versus non-renal
deaths). Table V summarises the causes of death in patients dying within two
years of onset (early deaths) and those who died later (late deaths). The totals
were in both categories greater (56 in all) than the number of patients, since
in many the causes were multiple. In the 17 early deaths active systemic
lupus erythematosus (12 cases) and infection (eight cases) predominated. In

the 24 late deaths, although active systemic lupus erythematosus was still
prominent (eight cases), vascular deaths became important (six). Statistical
analysis showed that active systemic lupus erythematosus was significantly
more common (p<005) in early than in late deaths, but no other differences
reached significance. Deaths from renal causes were also commoner in the
late group, but this also did not reach significance at the 5% level.
Analysis of the timing of the main categories of "death" after diagnosis
(fig) showed that the number of deaths decreased progressively with time.
This reflected not only a fall off in the number of patients at risk (fig) but also
a real decrease in mortality with time.
Clinical circumstances of entering end stage renal failure were correlated
with outcome in patients offered renal substitution therapy. Table VI
summarises the activity of systemic lupus erythematosus, renal histology,
treatment, and outcome according to the rate of deterioration of renal
function in the three months preceding end stage renal failure. One patient
(case 9) had to be excluded from this analysis because there were insufficient
data to assess the rate of decline in her renal function. The mortality among
those with a rapid decline in renal function and active systenmic lupus ery￾thematosus at end stage renal failure (14 patients) was high (64%), whereas
those with a slow decline and inactive lupus (10 patients) did better (40%
mortality). This difference just failed to reach significance at the 5% level.
FOLLOW UP IN RENAL FAILURE
The 15 patients who survived the period immediately after end stage renal
failure were followed up for a total of 36 patient years (mean 2 4 years; range
2-5 months to 5-0 years). Ten patients were dialysed for more than three
consecutive months for a total of 233 patient months (mean 23 months; range
3-5 to 58 months).
Persistent or recurring active extrarenal systemic lupus erythematosus
was not a major problem in patients surviving end stage renal failure. Of the
six patients who had active disease before starting dialysis, only one died
(elsewhere) from recurrent manifestations of lupus in the central nervous
system and three patients had exacerbations (cutaneous and minor neuro￾logical), easily controlled by a temporary increase in immunosuppression
and mainly during the first year of dialysis. Only one of the patients who had
inactive lupus at end stage renal failure later had recurrent activity (case 1:
episode of arthritis with depressed complement values and raised DNA
binding titre after two years of haemodialysis). All patients receiving dialysis
were maintained with small doses of prednisone (5-15 mg/24 h) and azathio￾prine (1-2 mglkgl24 h). Three patients were able to discontinue dialysis
(cases 10 to 12), although in one 'case 10) dialysis was reinstituted after 32
months and another (case I 1) again went into terminal uraemia.

TRANSPLANTATION
Eight patients received 10 kidney allografts. Two patients died one and a
half months and five years after transplantation (cases 26 and 27); two
patients returned to dialysis (one (case 5) after acutely rejecting two kidneys
and the other (case 6) after rejecting one); and four patients (cases 1 to 4) had
normal graft function 24, 21, 20, and 10 months after transplantation.
Systemic lupus erythematosus was inactive after transplantation: in parti￾cular there was no evidence of recurrent lupus nephritis in the grafts.
All patients received maintenance immunosuppressive treatment with
prednisone (10-15 mg'24 h) and azathioprine (2 5 mgikgl24 h).
VASCULAR DISEASE
Vascular disease as a cause of death in seven patients (cases 14, 21, 25, 27,
28, 30, and 33)-that is, 240o of the total number of true deaths. Death
resulted from coronary artery disease in five patients (myocardial infarction
documented at necropsy in four, severe ischaemic left ventricular dysfunction
proved by gated isotopic cardiac scan in one (case 28)); cerebrovascular
accidents (proved arteriographically) in one (case 30; this patient also
had insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and diabetic nephropathy); and
generalised vascular disease in one (case 14).
Three of these patients were women aged under 40 (cases 21, 27, and 30)
and one a man of 19 (case 25). Necropsy disclosed severe coronary athero￾sclerosis in four further patients dying from other causes, one of them (case
22) aged 47. Of the 15 necropsies, moderate to severe atheroma affecting the
coronary arteries was found in eight.
Reviewing our series of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus who
survived with renal function we identified a further seven with serious
vascular disease. Three of them were young women (aged 33, 35, and 38
years) with severe angina, three of them having required coronary bypass
grafting, including one receiving haemodialysis. We could not detect a
constant pattern of presence of risk factors (duration and severity of hyper￾tension, raised serum lipid values, prolonged nephrotic syndrome, duration
and dose of corticosteroid treatment) or associated heart disease (endo￾carditis or pericarditis) in the group of six patients with severe ischaemic
heart disease below the age of 40 (date not shown), but detailed comparison
with age matched patients with lupus and healthy controls was not performed.
Conclusions and discussion
A principal finding in this study was of a group of patients (10 out
of the total of 25) who died very soon despite beginning dialysis.22
With two exceptions they reached terminal renal failure after a
phase of rapidly declining renal function. In most this seemed to be
due to active lupus nephritis, although other haemodynamic factors
may have contributed to the rapid deterioration in glomerular
filtration rate.
The patients who survived the period immediately after end stage
renal failure fared relatively well, and the few who had active lupus
at that stage experienced progressively fewer extrarenal manifesta￾tions while receiving low doses of corticosteroids and azathioprine
as maintenance treatment. The rare "flares" of active disease were
easily controlled. There were three deaths in this group, but only
one was due to a recrudescence of lupus, again shortly after end
stage renal failure.

Timing of entry into terminal renal failure or death in patients with lupus
nephritis. Vertical columns show distribution in time of renal and non￾renal causes of death. Continuous line shows actuarially calculated pro￾portion of 138 patients surviving at risk at various times of follow up.
Patients entering terminal renal failure with active lupus and a
rapid decline in renal function therefore pose a difficult problem in
terms of management, which we have discussed elsewhere.22 The
added effects of immunosuppression, rapidly advancing uraemia,
and active disease25 26 predispose to infection but, on the other hand,
potent treatment is required to suppress extrarenal manifestations
and also to halt and possibly reverse the renal lesions.27 28 Despite an
aggressive therapeutic approach, most of our patients in this
"acute" group died from active systemic lupus erythematosus.
Possible explanations are that they were still undertreated, that
aggressive treatment was started too late, or that they represented a
particularly severe form of the disease which is resistant to available
treatments. Those patients with slowly progressive renal dysfunction
and inactive disease are predictably easier to manage, as it is possible
to decrease immunosuppression to minimal levels sufficient to
control extrarenal manifestations and start preparations for
replacement therapy once renal failure is moderately advanced, as
was suggested by Coplon et al and Friedman several years ago.29 3U In
our series four out of 10 patients in this group died, one of the deaths
occurring five years after transplantation.
Reports on survival of patients with lupus undergoing renal
replacement therapy are conflicting. Some workers note high
mortality rates-for example, Kimberly et al19 reported 15 deaths in
39 patients undergoing dialysis, Rosner et alt6 30 deaths in 57
patients in a large multicentre study, and the 982 combined report
of the European Dialysis and Transplant Association Registration
Committee2 a first year survival rate of only 7644% in 815 patients
undergoing first dialysis not followed by transplantation and a high
mortality rate in the early months after transplantation. Others have
had more encouraging results,t- 'I" and recently Coplon et al found
the long term clinical course after end stage renal failure in 28
patients to be comparable to that of patients undergoing replace￾ment therapy from other diseases. I These discrepancies may result
from the exclusion of the more acute group of patients in those series
having better results, which mainly include patients with stable,
long term renal failure, as recognised by Coplon et alls and discussed
by us.22 We find that this "acute" group forms a considerable
proportion of patients with lupus nephritis reaching end stage renal
failure. Our results resemble those of Kimberly et al, who found
that eight of their 15 deaths occurred shortly after the start of
dialysis and were due to persistence of the increase in disease activity
that led to end stage renal failure.'9 In the series of Rosner et al
systemic lupus erythematosus was active at the time of death in 21 of
30 deaths, which occurred significantly sooner than in those patients
dying with inactive lupus. It is not clear in their study, however,
whether the patients dying with active lupus had reached end stage
renal failure as the result of active nephritis.
Urowitz et al first drew attention to the emergence of what they
called a bimodal mortality pattern in systemic lupus erythematosus9
-namely, early deaths with active lupus, mainly due to nephritis
and infection; and late deaths associated with inactive lupus,
principally due to myocardial infarction. This was confirmed by
Karsh et al in their study of mortality in lupus nephritis,'3 which
suggested an early mortality from lupus and sepsis, a late mortality
from vascular disease, and a constant death rate from renal failure.
This pattern has been interpreted as the result of control of acute
early manifestations of the disease in some patients, who thus enter
a chronic phase, with eventual losses from causes not classically
related to lupus and not affected (or even made worse) by treat￾ment. 36 In our series the analysis was slightly different and this
pattern not so clear; although active lupus and, to a less extent,
infecton were appreciably more common as causes of early deaths,
and vascular events a cause of late deaths, there were many late
deaths due to active lupus (table V). This would fit with a model of
disease activity similar to that suggested by Urowitz et al9 and
Albert36 but taking into account the known relapsing course of the
disease. Renal deaths were commonly a late event, while death from
extrarenal causes (34% of the total) fell predominantly in the early
death group.
Fries et al found that most patients went thirough a phase of lupus
nephritis characterised by inactive systemic and renal disease but a
slow decline in renal function.37 In our study this pattern was the
exception rather than the rule; only 12 patients out of a total of 26
had such a course and 12 reached end stage renal failure as a result of
active lupus nephritis, commonly as an early event in their disease
(eight patients) but also late in its course (four).
Finally, accelerated atherosclerosis is now a well recognised
complication of systemic lupus erythematosus38-43 but its relative
importance and causes are matters of controversy. Recently in a

large multicentre study, Rosner et al found vascular events to be an
infrequent cause of death'6 (only six patients died from myocardial
infarction and another six from cerebrovascular accident out of a
total of 22 deaths); but in other series myocardial infarction was
reportedly much more commonly responsible for the death of
patients suffering from systemic lupus erythematous.9 "3"42 We
found that vascular events were a relatively uncommon but none the
less important cause of death (7 out of 41 patients). The finding of
six young women patients (all under 40) with severe ischaemic heart
disease is striking and raises the possibility that obvious or un￾identified atherogenic factors may be responsible for the particularly
advanced disease in a subgroup of patients.
Vascular disease in systemic lupus erythematosus has been
attributed variously to corticosteroids,4' hypertension, and the per￾sistence of nephrotic hyperlipidaemia,43 chronic renal failure, or the
disease itself. The most interesting possibility, however, is that in
some way the immunological events of systemic lupus erythematosus
-and in particular the abundant circulating immune complexes￾interact with other risk factors for cardiovascular disease which may
be present to increase the risk of disease events to high levels.6 42 The
presence of circulating immune complexes is known to potentiate
the effect of a high lipid diet in rabbits4 and baboons4" and the
restriction of fat in the diet' or the feeding of eicosapentaenoic
acid4/ to protect NZBAW mice from vascular lesions, in the latter
case also prolonging life by ameliorating the renal disease. By
contrast, feeding a high fat diet accelerates the glomerular disease.'
In these mice as well as those of the MRL/1 and B xSB strains
myocardial infarction is a common event, affecting 25-30% ofmice.49
In the important study of Haider and Roberts the degree of post￾mortem narrowing of the coronary arteries in patients dying of
systemic lupus erythematosus under the age of 40 was compared
with age and sex matched controls.42 Advanced lesions were present
in half the patients, the remainder showing narrowing comparable
to that in the control group. In these two subgroups those with
coronary narrowing showed higher serum cholesterol concentra￾tions, higher blood pressure, and non-coronary heart lesions such as
pericarditis and valve lesions, but the corticosteroid dosage was the
same.

Addendum
After this paper was written a further patient, a girl aged only 12,
died of a myocardial infarct proved at necropsy just after starting
regular dialysis. She had had lupus for only 18 months and the
condition appeared to be an acute vasculitis rather than degenera￾tive disease. Ishikawa et al also described myocardial infarction in a
child with lupus, from diffuse atherosclerosis only two years from
onset of lupus.51

WORDS DISORIENTATED, in a clinical context, means mentally con￾fused; being grossly mistaken regarding one's place in the environment or,
by extension, in time. Disorientation mav also rarely occur in healthy
people during difficult flying conditions.' Etymologically, disorientated
means not knowing in which direction east lies; L ornre, orientem, to rise;
hence the region of the globe beyond that point on the horizon at which the
sun rises; the orient, the East (as viewed from Europe). But why not the
West? Why should a confused person not be described as "disocci￾dentated" (not knowing in which direction west lies)?
"Oriental" and "occidental" date from the fourteenth century. Major
European travel during the preceding century was eastward (the Crusades,
Marco Polo), and thoughts on far off lands were turned in that direction.
Perhaps the clue lies there. Homologues of "disorientated" exist in all
Romance languages (F desonente, Sp desonentado>-with one curious
exception, Portuguese, in which language the equivalent term is "des￾norteado." Linguistically, the Portuguese, when confused, do not know in
which direction north lies. This probably stems from the days of the great
Portuguese navigators of the early sixteenth century, notably Vasco da
Gama and Magellan. At sea by night they would have depended for
direction finding on Polaris the north star.-B J FREEDMAN.
