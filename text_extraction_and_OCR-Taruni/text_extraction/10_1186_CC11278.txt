It is a pleasure to announce the 2nd Innsbruck Hypothermia Symposium.
We are very happy that Critical Care has agreed to publish extended
abstracts submitted by invited renowned scientists from all over the world;
that is, Europe, the Americas, Asia. Neuroprotection - potentially achieved
by targeted temperature management (that is, therapeutic hypothermia or
prophylactic controlled normothermia) - is essential in emergency and
acute care management of various severe neurologic and cardiologic
diseases. Beyond neuroprotection - for this aim, therapeutic hypothermia
has been established after resuscitation of patients with cardiac arrest due
to a shockable arrhythmia and in neonatal asphyxic encephalopathy -
therapeutic hypothermia and prophylactic controlled normothermia have
been published in single case reports, retrospective, open, but also in
prospective randomised controlled trials in many other emergency
disciplines in which both neuroprotection and protection of other organs
and tissues are the target of our therapeutic endeavours. The Medical
University Innsbruck, Austria, is happy to organise this conference on
temperature management, therapeutic hypothermia and prophylactic
normothermia respectively, to be held in Portoroz, Slovenia. In accordance
with the first Meeting on Hypothermia, which was held in Miami, Florida,
USA (CHilling At the Beach), we are proud to suggest the acronym CHAB
standing for take Care for Heart And Brain, characterising the major target
organs of therapeutic and, possibly also, prophylactic temperature
management. Again, we have been able to gather most renowned
scientists, neurointensivists and intensivists, emergency physicians,
cardiologists and other specialists to cover the entire scientific and clinical
spectrum of emergency temperature management, technical aspects of
cooling and management of potential complications including shivering,
but also temperature management in neurology, neurosurgery, intensive
care medicine, in the operation theatre, cardiology, infectious diseases, and
so forth. Beyond that we cross borders and discuss hypothermia and
intracranial pressure, pharmacodynamics in hypothermic patients and the
influence of hypothermia onto pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics,
hypothermia in refractory status epilepticus or heat stroke, hypothermia
and advanced neuromonitoring, hypothermia and nutrition, shivering and
the critical issue of rewarming, amongst other topics.
The aim of this symposium is to enhance the knowledge on temperature
management, increase the readiness and stimulate the preparedness to
institute therapeutic hypothermia and/or prophylactic controlled
normothermia, respectively, in patients in need of tissue and organ
protection, uncontrolled body temperatures possibly adding - per se - to
neuronal damage. Knowing the medical literature and knowing the issue
of potentially life-threatening side effects and complications incurred by
this invasive therapeutic manoeuvre, it is the foremost aim of this
symposium and this supplementary issue of Critical Care to discuss all
these aspects of targeted temperature management in emergency, critical
care and, in particular, neurocritical patients and conditions. For this reason
the organisers have agreed that the discussion of these various issues,
being so important for general critical care, neurocritical care and
emergency medicine, must be distributed as widely as possible, making it
available to critical care and neurocritical care specialists all over the world.
Therefore we are extremely grateful to the Editors of Critical Care for
providing a forum for all of the extended abstracts of all invited speakers,
covering the entire field of adult emergency and critical care medicine. We
do hope and we are convinced that this supplementary issue will be a
source of inspiration and knowledge, hopefully becoming a work of
reference for intensivists, neurologists, neurointensivists, cardiologists and
all emergency physicians alike. It is the aim of the organisers to establish a
series of such symposia within the next years in order to keep up with all
the developments in this field and to maintain the highest possible level of
knowledge of targeted temperature management in the community of
emergency and intensive care physicians.

For almost a century, therapeutic hypothermia - or as it was termed in the
early days: hibernation - has been discussed as a potential neuroprotective
measure, in particular in patients suffering from severe intracranial disease
leading to impairment of consciousness, associated with fever [1-3].
In a wide range of diseases, secondary damage to the brain or other
organs follows the initial impact and may be responsible for aggravation of
disease condition or clinical state, in particular neurological morbidity and/
or mortality [4-11]. Therapeutic hypothermia, recently renamed targeted
temperature management, including prophylactic normothermia, has been
used to improve this secondary impact onto brain and other organ tissue.
This holds true, in particular, for neurological and neurosurgical intensive
care patients since secondary brain and nervous tissue injury may preclude
a potentially benign course of disease. The mechanisms of action of
hypothermia are complex, not yet fully understood. Therapeutic
hypothermia/targeted temperature management aims to attenuate a
cascade of secondary injury mechanisms, which is started immediately

after the initial event (primary injury) and may last for hours and even days
[4,6,12]. The majority of research has focused, so far, on these secondary
injury processes being destructive to brain and nervous tissue. It may be
expected that any such protective effect can be replicated in other organs
and tissues during therapeutic hypothermia/targeted temperature
management. A wide range of side effects may negate and counteract its
positive initial effect; this implies side effects of hypothermia per se and
side effects of rewarming or inconstant maintenance of temperature levels
[13-17].
This abstract limits itself to potential pathophysiological mechanisms of
actions, the risks of any such mechanism and side effects derived from
them [4,5,10,12,16-18].
The protective effect of hypothermia may be explained by several pathways.
A decreased metabolism with less oxygen and energy consumption and carbon
dioxide production may prevent secondary injury when oxygen supply is
interrupted or, at least, impaired. However, it needs to be stressed that the
reduction in metabolic rate, as seen in hypothermia, requires adjustment in
ventilator setup, insulin infusion rate, correct interpretation of electrolytes, in
particular low phosphate, magnesium and potassium levels. Of particular
interest are the rebound phenomena during rewarming or when,
involuntarily, the temperature cannot be maintained at the targeted low
level.
Following ischemia, hypoxia or direct trauma apoptotic processes may be
initiated in brain tissue and neuronal cells may even become necrotic. In
these earliest stages these pathways may be blocked by hypothermia.
However, little is known about the time frame and best window of
opportunity to use therapeutic hypothermia to prevent initiation of
apoptotic/necrotic processes.
Any type of neuronal injury may provoke the neuro-excitatory cascade,
starting off with excessive calcium influx, glutamate receptor activation,
neuronal hyperexcitability, eventually leading to cell death even after
reperfusion and normalization of glutamate levels. It has been suggested
that therapeutic hypothermia may reduce cellular/neuronal damage
following this neuro-excitatory cascade.
It has been accepted that the release of free radicals may be deleterious to
both neuronal cells and the brain’s defense mechanisms alike. Whether the
direct impact or the ischemia reperfusion injury is overwhelmingly
responsible for the release/increase of free radicals oxidizing and
damaging neuronal cell components is both still a matter of discussion
and of limited interest when therapeutic hypothermia comes into play.
Hyperexcitability, cellular hyperactivity, mitochondrial dysfunction, ion￾pump failure and reduction in cellular membrane integrity may lead to
intracellular and, consequently, also intercellular/extracellular acidosis.
Early initiation of hypothermia may improve this full spectrum of cellular
failure, improve brain glucose and energy metabolism and reduce lactate
accumulation; with this, intracellular and intercellular acidosis will improve
and eventually metabolic recovery be enhanced [4,19-21].
Any type of brain injury is capable of disrupting the blood brain barrier
leading to enhanced vascular permeability, brain edema, vascular
permeability and perivascular hemorrhage. Brain edema, both after
ischemia/hypoxia and traumatic injury peaks after 24 to 72 hours
(sometimes reaching its highest peak even after this period of time) - thus
opening widely the therapeutic window - allowing for therapeutic
hypothermia to reduce brain edema via stabilizing the disrupted blood￾brain barrier and vascular permeability. After brain injury proinflammatory
mediators are released, leucocytes cross the - already impaired - blood￾brain barrier leading to an accumulation of inflammatory cells in the brain.
This inflammatory response starts within 1 hour after injury and may
persist for up to 5 days, a fact which also suggests a widely open
therapeutic window for intervention. Hypothermia has been shown to
reduce ischemia induced inflammatory and immune reactions [4,19-22].
In healthy persons, brain temperature is around 0.5 to 1°C higher than core
body temperature. In any type of brain injury, in particular, in patients with
fever or hyperpyrexia respectively, injured areas may be definitely hotter
(up to 2°C post injury), most probably due to transitory cellular
hyperactivity. Local brain edema might lead to cerebral thermopooling
adding to hyperthermia-related neuronal cellular injury [4,16,18-21].
Cooling below 35°C has been shown to affect coagulation, it depends on the
initial type of brain injury whether a procoagulatory effect or an
anticoagulatory effect is believed to be neuroprotective in an individual case.
Targeted temperature management may influence the secretion of
vasoconstricting substances (for example, endothelin) or vasodilating
substances (for example, prostaglandins). Their balance is essential to
maintain homeostasis. Ischemic or traumatic conditions may increase
vasoconstricting substances thus leading to reduced cerebral blood flow.
Whether hypothermia is capable of regulating/improving cerebral
perfusion is still a matter of investigation, pending the influence of
cerebral autoregulation and the quantity of secreted vasoactive mediators
in brain-injured patients with cerebral ischemia or any other type of
injury [10].
Whether epileptic activity, in particular, subtle nonconvulsive status
epilepticus, accepted to indicate severe brain damage, can be positively
influenced by therapeutic hypothermia still needs further research.
However, it is accepted that a subtle nonconvulsive status epilepticus
occurring in the acute phase of brain injury is - per se - adding to neuronal
destruction [10,16].
While many pathophysiological processes and cascades may be influenced
by targeted temperature management/therapeutic hypothermia and/or even
prevention of fever through prophylactic normothermia, it is unclear whether
in all types of severely brain-injured patients (for whatever reason) the
benefits of this therapeutic hypothermia always outweigh its risks. It is now
fully accepted and of a high level of evidenced medicine that in cerebral
hypoxia (in a patient with cardiac arrest due to a shockable arrhythmia) as
well as asphyxial encephalopathy a 24-hour therapeutic hypothermia (33 to
34°C), irrespective of the type of cooling, improves neurological outcome;
that is, morbidity but also mortality [7,10]. Whether therapeutic hypothermia/
targeted temperature management or prophylactic normothermia may
improve outcome in other diseases, as discussed in this meeting, is still not
clear. It needs to be stressed that even such seemingly similar diseases as
global hypoxia (in cardiac arrest due to a shockable arrhythmia), asphyxial
encephalopathy and ischemic stroke have so few pathophysiologic cascades
in common. Therefore, they may not be treated all alike, in particular, with
respect to type, duration, speed and depth of hypothermia as well as
rewarming management [23]. It has already been demonstrated that in
hypoxic encephalopathy hypothermia for 24 hours may be sufficient.
However, disease entities such as ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke with
formation of peri-hematomal edema, traumatic brain injuries with prolonged
secondary insult or the wide range of neuronal injuries after subarachnoid
hemorrhage may present even more complex pathophysiologic mechanisms.
Moreover, different pathologies such as encephalitis and bacterial meningitis
or even spinal cord injury may all require a targeted and personalized
approach to this adjunctive therapy. In some cases, prolonged hypothermia
may be equally necessary as in other cases mild hypothermia or even only
prophylactic normothermia may suffice.
It may be stated beyond doubt that the neuroprotective effect of
moderate hypothermia (33 to 34°C) has been shown in cerebral hypoxia
and asphyxial encephalopathy. However, different neurocritical care
disease entities as discussed above have different mechanisms of primary
insults as well as the mechanisms and cascades of secondary brain injury
and therefore require a different therapeutic approach in respect of
temperature management.
Any type of therapeutic measure, still being the subject of research, must
never harm the patient. Hypothermia-induced neurological signs and
symptoms must never be misinterpreted and as a matter of course the
diagnosis of brain death can never be confirmed under hypothermic
conditions [24].

Mild hypothermia is widely used in the treatment of successfully
resuscitated patients after cardiac arrest [1]. Previous experimental and
clinical studies have demonstrated beneficial effects of cooling after
cardiac arrest. Two clinical landmark studies in 2002 demonstrated the use
of therapeutic hypothermia after cardiac arrest due to ventricular
fibrillation decreases mortality and improves neurological outcome [2,3].
This led the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation and the
American Heart Association to recommend the use of therapeutic
hypothermia after cardiac arrest as soon as possible after the return of
spontaneous circulation (ROSC) [4].
Despite major progress in intensive care medicine in the last decades,
mortality rates after cardiac arrest remain unacceptably high [2,3]. The high
mortality rates after cardiac arrest can be attributed to a unique
pathophysiological process [1,5,6]. The entity of the pathophysiological
changes after ROSC - for example, activation of the inflammatory system -
can be summarized as the post-cardiac arrest syndrome [1,5-7].
Hypoxic encephalopathy, which is often a result of the initial hypoxic
phase and/or the post-cardiac arrest syndrome, is one of the main causes
for mortality, disability and a need for permanent care in patients after
cardiac arrest [1].
Pathophysiologically, the resuscitation period could be divided into
different time periods. After cessation of circulation, ischemia of different
tissues leads to necrotic cell death (hypoxia-induced cellular dysfunction)
[7,8]. Reperfusion injury then follows after an imprecise period of time
once oxygenated blood is returned to the ischemic tissues with the
beginning of mechanical resuscitation (reperfusion-induced cell death)
[7,8]. From experimental and clinical studies, it is clear that the tissue
damage due to reperfusion occurs over several hours to days in the post￾resuscitation phase [1,7,8].
Several experimental studies have emphasized induction of therapeutic
hypothermia as soon as possible after ROSC or during cardiopulmonary
resuscitation [7-10]. These studies in the different animal models
demonstrate a beneficial effect, including attenuation of the cerebral injury
after prolonged ischemia due to earlier cooling [7-10]. Recent experimental
data in different animal models of cardiac arrest, stroke and myocardial
infarction suggest that warm reperfusion under normal or hyperthermic
conditions could increase the deleterious effects of the reperfusion. For the
effective prevention and treatment of the reperfusion injury, reperfusion
should occur in temperature-controlled or cooled tissues.
Nevertheless, prehospital induction of therapeutic hypothermia is still
under discussion; consistent protocols are not present and human data are
rare. In a retrospective clinical study, early achievement of the target
temperature appeared to reduce hypoxic brain injury and favor a good
neurologic outcome after successful resuscitation [11].
On the other hand, a small retrospective, observational investigation
found a faster decline in body temperature to the target temperature is
linked to a less favorable neurologic outcome in comatose patients after
cardiac arrest treated with therapeutic hypothermia [12]. However, this
may simply indicate a severe ischemic damage with consecutive impaired
thermoregulation [12].
In the PRINCE study, feasibility of preclinical transnasal cooling with
evaporated perfluorcarbon that primarily leads to a prior selective cooling
of the cerebrum was analyzed. In a subgroup of patients, intra-arrest
hypothermia via evaporated perfluorcarbon was beneficial [13,14]. Several
other studies show also safety and feasibility of prehospital hypothermia
[15,16]. In summary, prehospital treatment of patients with a cardiac cause
of the arrest may increase the rate of favorable outcome at hospital
discharge. Further larger clinical investigations are needed to evaluate the
effects of prehospital cooling in cardiac arrest patients [7,8]. In a small
survey of emergency physicians in Germany, only a minority of patients is
frequently treated with hypothermia before hospital admission after
successful resuscitation [7,8].
However, taking the pathophysiological processes into consideration,
induction of therapeutic hypothermia should not be limited to the ICUs
but should also be able in the field or in the emergency department.
Different methods are available to achieve and maintain the target
temperature in the prehospital setting [7,8].

Standard operating procedures: therapeutic hypothermia in CPR and
post-resuscitation care

After two randomised studies published in 2002 [1,2] mild therapeutic
hypothermia treatment was internationally recommended as early and
efficious treatment for comatose survivors after cardiac arrest (CA) not only
with ventricular fibrillation, but also for patients suffering from CA
presenting with other initial rhythms (asystole, PEA) and different
underlying causes. Therapeutic hypothermia has been shown in these
investigations to improve not only survival significantly after CA but
especially the neurologic outcome after different courses of cooling
treatment. Nevertheless the in-hospital mortality of those patients
remained high.
While several prehospital or pre-CPR factors contributing to the patients’
outcome are well known and implemented in the BLS and ACLS
guidelines, only little is known about the kind and impact of in-hospital
contributing factors worsening the chance of surviving the event with
good neurological function. After return of spontaneous circulation, major
cardiovascular and haemodynamic disorders are widely common and
associated with a high rate of deaths within the first 24 hours after CPR.
Sufficient post-resuscitation therapy has to include optimal treatment
strategies of the cardiovascular and metabolic system, adaequate
ventilation support and strategies of neuroprotection [3]. In patients
surviving with a favourable outcome, haemodynamic and respiratory
disorders tend to normalise within the first 24 hours after ROSC.
Several factors of hospital care are obviously important for survival of post￾CA patients. Observational investigations done in Norway and Sweden
detected severe differences in outcome of patients admitted to hospital
with ROSC after out-of-hospital CA presenting survival rates between 33 to
56% and 14 to 42% respectively [4-6]. There were no significant differences
in the prehospital management of those patients, but in-hospital factors
like blood glucose levels, seizures, body temperature and laboratory
changes could be related to outcome. A similar cohort study using a
multicentre clinical ICU registry in the United States enrolled 4,674 patients
from 39 hospitals covering a 4-year hiatus showed the same interhospital
variability in survival with an unadjusted mortality ranging from 41 to 81%.
Those patients treated in centres with higher case volumes were
significantly less likely to die in-hospital after ROSC independent of the
location of the CA. As it was not possible to differentiate the effect of
specific therapies and interventions on survival in the post-CA period, the
results underlined the need for additional research to define optimal post￾cardiac treatment strategies. The data underlined not only the volume￾outcome relationship but also the necessity of implementing standardised
guidelines for optimal post-CA care in specialised centres.
Based on this evidence a prospective observational study was performed in
patients admitted to hospital after regaining ROSC and treated using a
standardised treatment protocol including instant onset of therapeutic
hypothermia, early reperfusion treatment with PCI, and protocol-based early￾goal-directed therapy to restore adaequate arterial blood flow in the
reperfusion period [7]. The observational group from the interventional
period was compared with controls from an earlier period in the same
hospital. There were not only major differences in survival but also in the
quality of neurologic outcome. After implementation of the standardised
treatment protocol, survival improved from 31% to 56% in the interventional
period, 56% of the patients showed a favourable neurologic outcome (26%
in the control period) at hospital discharge and were still alive after 1 year.
With no changes in the algorithm of prehospital care in the years of the
investigation, post-resuscitation care appeared to have a major effect on
improving not only survival but also the neurologic outcome after successful
CPR.
Despite the fact that the level of evidence for many of the treatment
strategies with the exception of therapeutic hypothermia in post￾resuscitation care is weak, the quality of care after admission to the ICU
or ED seems to be a somewhat missing link in the chain of survival. The
post-resuscitation phase is associated with a sepsis-like syndrome [8] of
unknown time course causing or even intensifying global ischaemic brain
damage and dysfunctional heart disease. Treatment of these disorders is
the main challenge after ROSC, but implementation of such strategies is
often slow and in a heterogeneous manner causing a widely variable
state of post-resuscitation care.
Many factors (Table 1) may contribute to this phenomenon and show the
complexity of treating patients after ROSC. This underlines the necessity
of using protocol-driven care in those patients to help physicians and
nurses to raise the level for the number of patients receiving standard
therapy. It is obvious that such protocols have to be adapted to local
hospital specialities and logistic factors.
In our hospital an early algorithm for therapeutic hypothermia based on
the standards used during the HACA trial [1] was designed and
implemented immediately after enrolling patients for that European
multicentre study in 2001. All patients being successfully resuscitated
after CA independent from localisation, initial rhythm and type of the
event were treated by therapeutic hypothermia and enrolled in our own
database (CoolBrain Registry Bonn) including EMS data, course and
technique of cooling and following temperature management, neurologic
outcome at discharge and in a 1-year follow-up. Shortly after
implementing the cooling protocol a special algorithm for general post￾resuscitation care including therapeutic hypothermia and focusing on an
early goal-directed approach to cardiac function, normoventilation,
seizure treatment and strict avoidance of high blood glucose levels was
designed and enabled physicians and nurses how to monitor and treat
those patients. Baseline data of heart and brain function using invasive
cardiac output monitoring and brain damage markers were included in
the database as well. Both protocols and order sets are actualised to new
guidelines and therapeutic standards based on actual science on a
regular basis.

Unfortunately there is only limited access to outcome data of our patients
treated before implementation of these SOP protocols, so the data from
the CoolBrain Registry are only observational and cannot be compared
with a control group before using protocol-driven therapeutic standards.
Neurologic outcome was not recorded before implementing therapeutic
hypothermia as standard care in 2001; survival rates after OHCA were
recorded between 1990 and 2000 as lower than 20%.
Data enrolled from March 2001 to December 2011 (n = 276) presented a
general survival rate of 51% independent of origin, initial rhythm and
localisation of the cardiac arrest. Thirty-nine per cent of those patients
showed a favourable neurologic outcome (CPC 0.5), 12% severe
neurologic disability. In the group of survivors, 69.5% of patients with
ventricular fibrillation as the initial rhythm showed an excellent
neurologic performance (CPC 1) and 35% of patients presenting with
asystole/PEA as well at hospital discharge.
Despite missing a control group before implementing therapeutic
hypothermia and standardised treatment protocols for post-resuscitation
care, these data show the effect of protocol-based treatment especially on
neurologic outcome of those patients. This underlines that more attention
has to be focused on optimising and standardising post-resuscitation care
to improve survival and neurologic outcome. Treatment of patients with
CA does not end with ROSC; despite the fact that there is only weak
scientific level of evidence for some singular strategies of post-CA
treatment, the combination of an aggressive multifactorial therapeutic
approach including temperature management significantly improves
outcome. Therefore further clinical trials of other post-resuscitation
therapies seem to be essential.

Introduction: Mild therapeutic hypothermia after cardiac arrest has become
standard in post-resuscitation care in many hospitals as it is recommended
by current guidelines. The last update of guidelines by the European
Resuscitation Council on post-cardiac arrest treatment in 2010 recommends
hypothermia for every patient after cardiac arrest who remains unconscious
after cardiac arrest [1]. In addition to milestone trials [2-4], current published
retrospective data from the large Finnish registry showed in a large group of
patients a significant reduction of hospital mortality of survivors of out-of￾hospital cardiac arrest after implementation of hypothermia [5].
The mild therapeutic hypothermia procedure after cardiac arrest can be
divided into three phases: introduction, maintenance and rewarming. The
cooling techniques and devices to induce cooling of the cardiac arrest
survivor can be separated into three main groups: conventional cooling
(no device), non-invasive (surface) systems, and invasive (intravascular)
systems (Table 1).
Cooling techniques: Conventional cooling methods: The easiest way
to induce hypothermia after cardiac arrest is by using cold saline (for
example, 0.9% NaCl solution), crushed ice or ice bags. Kim and colleagues
reported the safety and efficacy of the administration of up to 2 litres of 4°C
cold saline to the patient after hospital admission [6]. Others published data
using 30 ml/kg body weight of saline 0.9% NaCl or Ringer’s lactate
combined sometimes with ice bags, which led to an acceptable reduction of
the temperature [7-10]. Furthermore cold saline as well as other methods
like cooling caps and helmets have been evaluated for induction mainly in
the preclinical setting [4,11,12]. Kliegel and colleagues pointed out that cold
infusion alone is effective for induction but not for tight maintenance of the
target temperature [13]. However, in at least one trial the combination of
cold saline and ice packs was proven to be effective even to maintain
temperature [7]. Focusing on the induction in the in-hospital setting, most
authors rank cold saline and crushed ice more as effective adjuvant
methods to be combined with a computer-controlled cooling device [10].
The big advantage of cold saline is its availability at almost every place in
the hospital if provided and the low costs. Following the data available
concerning different amounts of saline administered to the patient, a
median amount of 1 to 2 litres of saline seems safe after cardiac arrest. To
maintain target temperature with cold saline and ice bags seems to require
a high binding of personnel method without a very precise influence on the
central body temperature.
Surface cooling methods: Surface, non-invasive devices have to be
distinguished from intravascular, invasive devices. The range of available
computer-controlled surface devices with automatic temperature feedback
stretches from cooling blankets to be placed around the patient (Blanketrol
III, Cincinnati Sub-Zero; CritiCool, Medical ThermoRegulation Expertise) to
adhesive cooling pads (Arctic Sun, Bard). Heard and colleagues compared
the adhesive Arctic Sun surface-cooling system with normal cooling blankets
combined with ice bags. Although the reached target temperature within
4 hours was not significantly different between the groups, the Arctic Sun
system cooled more rapidly down to the target temperature [14]. A current
investigation from Norway compared the Arctic Sun surface (C.R. Bard)
system (n = 92) with the invasive intravascular Coolgard (Alsius) system (n =
75) in cardiac arrest survivors. The authors concluded no significant
differences concerning neurological outcome and survival at discharge.
A limitation for interpretation of the device efficacy (cooling rate/hour) is the
additional induction of cooling with cold saline and ice bags already in the
emergency room [15]. A published case report described a severe skin
peeling during hypothermia with the Arctic Sun system without a known
history of skin problems or steroid therapy but with end-stage renal disease
and coronary artery disease. This is the first severe adverse skin event
towards the hydrogel pads known and the authors conclude that these skin
lesions are very unusual as to be caused by the adhesive pads because
exfoliative dermatitis is a rare syndrome and is often drug induced [16].
Thus adverse skin reactions should not normally be expected using this
method of cooling.
Another surface feedback system using blankets is the CritiCool Pro system
by Medical ThermoRegulation Expertise (MTRE, Israel). The patient is
wrapped into the body-shaped heat exchange garment resulting in a
median cooling rate of 0.7 ± 0.37°C/hour in a study by Laish-Farkash and
colleagues [17]. The Cincinnati Sub-Zero system has been compared with
the ArcticSun2000 (C.R. Bard) system by Mayer and colleagues for fever
control in neurocritical care patients. The authors conclude the ArcticSun
system to be superior to the Cincinnati Sub-Zero system due to the
maintenance of normothermia, a higher cooling rate and better fever
reduction, although shivering occurred more frequently in the ArcticSun
group [18]. A surface cooling system without computer control and
automatic temperature feedback is the EMCOOLS cooling system. The
adhesive pads use a novel carbon cooling gel that has a high thermal
conductivity resulting in a cooling rate of more than 3.5°C/hour. The Flex
Pad needs to be adapted to the body size and shape. The feasibility trial of
out-of-hospital surface cooling after return of spontaneous circulation
(ROSC) in 15 survivors using the EMCOOLS system revealed a high median
cooling rate of 3.3°C/hour, the target temperature of 33°C was reached
approximately within 70 minutes (55 to 106 minutes) after the start of
cooling and no skin lesions were observed [19]. A further novel system is
the Life Recovery ThermoSuit system, which was developed mainly for fast

induction of hypothermia by cold water (2°C) immersion due to a lack of a
temperature feedback mechanism. The water circulates continuously
directly on the patient’s skin with a median cooling rate of 3°C/hour [20].
Published data by Howes and colleagues report the safe use of the
ThermoSuit system in 24 cardiac arrest survivors reaching the target
temperature(<34°C) within 37 minutes (range 14 to 81 minutes) [21]. After
the patients have reached the target temperature, they have to be
removed from the suit and cooling maintained with other methods.
Endovascular cooling: Intravascular closed-loop cooling systems are also
computer controlled with a temperature feedback. The Thermogard XP
Temperature Management System (Zoll) provides both a central venous
catheter with an additional closed loop balloon system with circulating
water for cooling. The InnerCool RTx device (Philips) using the Accutrol
catheter has a special feature with an integrated temperature sensor but
no additional central intravascular access. A possible advantage of taking
the temperature directly in the bloodstream is the avoidance of lag in core
temperature measurement inherent in rectal and bladder sensors. The very
precise temperature control is needed, taking the high average cooling
rates of 4.0 to 5.0°C/hour into consideration. This cooling system will be
under evaluation in the Rapid Endovascular Catheter Core Cooling
combined with cold saline as an Adjunct to Percutaneous Coronary
Intervention for the Treatment of Acute Myocardial Infarction (CHILL-MI)
study. This study was started in 2012 to further investigate the safety and
effectiveness of the endovascular cooling system in patients suffering from
ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and to confirm the data from
the Rapid-MI-ICE trial [22]. In a subanalysis of the European Hypothermia
After Cardiac Arrest trial (HACA), Holzer and colleagues retrospectively
reviewed the efficacy and safety of the intravascular catheter system (Cool
Gard 3000, Alsius) in 56 patients, revealing a cooling rate of 1.2°C/hour
(IQR 0.7 to 1.5) without significant differences to other techniques
concerning adverse events [23]. A study by Gillies and colleagues reported
a good temperature control with endovascular cooling compared with
conventional ice surface cooling [24]. After induction of cooling with cold
saline, one group was continued to be cooled with ice (n = 41) whereas
the other group was cooled with the Coolgard device (n = 42; Alsius). In
summary, catheter cooling provided a more precise temperature control,
better control during rewarming, less overcooling and failure to reach
target temperature. Despite these advantages there was no difference
concerning outcome between both relatively small groups [24]. The
duration of time an intravascular catheter can be used as central
intravenous access after rewarming is not well investigated so far.
Al-Senani and colleagues evaluated the safety of the Icy catheter during a
cooling procedure [25]. However, intravascular catheters can cause
bloodstream infections and raise the question about the risk of venous
thrombosis. Few cases with thrombosis or thrombophlebitis due to a
cooling catheter after a using time of respectively 7 and 10 days have
been published [26]. Simosa and colleagues reported in a group of
10 patients with traumatic brain injury that five patients developing a
depth venous thrombosis after an average of 5.4 days but concluded that
the group under examination already had a high risk for development of
thrombosis due to lack of prophylactic anticoagulation [27]. However, the
approach towards anticoagulation will be different in survivors after
cardiac arrest. The recommendation for the duration of use of the Icy
catheter is 4 days (Icy Quattro) but a novel surface coating of the catheter
material will soon be approved by authorities to enhance time of use and
decrease risk of thrombosis. In addition there might be a higher risk of
developing catheter-related bloodstream infections but currently no data
are published studying temperature management catheters and infection
rates.
Other cooling methods: The novel RhinoChill intranasal cooling device
was able to demonstrate effective reduction of body temperature within the
Pre-ROSC Intranasal Cooling Effectiveness trial (PRINCE trial) [28]. The
portable system vaporises perfluorchlorcarbon gas with a catheter system
into the nasal cavity leading to a fast induction of hypothermia first to the
brain as main target organ and second to the body with a slight delay. The
intra-arrest cooling approach of the study, starting induction of hypothermia
already during CPR, by Castrén and colleagues was conducted as a safety
and feasibility study [28]. However, benefit towards survival and neurological
outcome was observed in the cooling subgroup, having received CPR within
10 minutes after collapse, although the design of the study was not
conceived for outcome analysis. The randomised trial compared in detail
prehospital trans-nasal cooling (n = 83) with advanced cardiac live support
(n = 99) and both groups received mild hypothermia on admission to the
hospital regardless of the initial rhythm. This method was able to show a
significant decrease of tympanic temperature on arrival (34.2°C vs. 35.5°C).
Due to the convincing data from the PRINCE trial, the Prehospital
Resuscitation Intra Nasal Cooling Effectiveness Survival Study (PRINCESS)
started in June 2010 with patient recruitment and is designed to evaluate
for good or poor neurological outcome and survival as well as to evaluate
the proportion of those achieving ROSC and time to target temperature of
32 to 34°C. First data will be available in June 2013 (ClinicalTrial.gov
identifier: NCT01400373). The system has no temperature feedback and the
major application area is the induction of hypothermia. Another novel
approach is under investigation in the CAMARO trial (ClinicalTrials.gov
identifier: NCT01016236).
Following the idea of early and fast induction of hypothermia to improve
outcome and decrease side effects after cardiac arrest and incorporate novel
data that hypothermia applied before a coronary intervention may reduce
the infarct size in STEMI patients, a new automated peritoneal lavage system
(Velomedix Inc., Palo Alto, USA) has been developed [22]. The CAMARO trial
includes cardiac arrest patients as well as STEMI patients who will be cooled
to a target temperature of 34°C without prior resuscitation. The preliminary
data of this pilot study, presented as an abstract at the American Heart
Association Meeting in Orlando, USA, in November 2011, showed a decrease
of temperature to 34°C within 9 minutes, the maintenance phase of 32.5°C
was 24 hours in cardiac arrest patients (rewarming 16 hours) and 3 hours
maintenance in myocardial infarction patients (rewarming 5 hours). At the
moment no device-related complication has occurred with this extremely
rapid cooling method [29].
Discussion: Different cooling methods with varying technical approaches
and efficacy are available to deliver mild therapeutic hypothermia to our
patients. During cooling the three phases of induction, maintenance and
rewarming can be defined. Are different methods necessary to fulfil the
requirements in each of these three cooling phases? Taking all mentioned
methods together, a combined approach seems to be the optimal way.
Particularly with regard to the induction phase a combination of different
methods should be suggested to increase the effectiveness of cooling, for
example the combination of cold saline and a feedback cooling device,
although the optimal overall timing (time to target temperature and cooling
rate) is still under debate. In addition to timing, the most important question
concerns shivering and its prophylactic successful treatment.
The optimal and most beneficial time point to start hypothermia after
cardiac arrest is still not known. The current European resuscitation
guidelines recommend starting hypothermia as soon as possible after ROSC.

A recently published article by Sendelbach and colleagues revealed the
importance of avoiding any time delay of cooling to reach good
neurological outcome [30]. This ‘earlier is better’ strategy can be confirmed
by animal data [31-34]. Following the ‘earlier is better’ strategy, some trials
explored the possibility of inducing cooling during resuscitation or directly
after ROSC, but data are controversial [35]. Induction of therapeutic
hypothermia during prehospital CPR using ice-cold intravenous fluid or
intranasal cooling showed that it is feasible and is partially a benefit
[28,36]. A major problem in predicting outcome and association with
timing and early cooling after cardiac arrest or even during resuscitation
with these data is the small sample size and the fact that prehospital
hypothermia was discontinued after admission to the hospital in many of
these trials [37]. However, the analysis of data from the Scandinavian
Hypothermia Network including 986 patients after cardiac arrest by
Nielsen and colleagues showed no association of timing towards
neurological outcome [38].
Certainly every ICU should provide 4°C cold saline to increase the cooling
rate and to reach the target temperature as soon as possible. The
administration of cold saline seems a feasible method in the preclinical
setting as well as in addition to other preclinical devices available and after
admission cold saline can be combined with a feedback device to speed up
the cooling. Furthermore, shivering is one of the most important side effects
that can occur during hypothermia leading to an increased metabolic rate,
high oxygen consumption and heat generation, and therefore needs to be
kept in mind to be avoided and treated aggressively. The threshold for this
defence mechanism of the thermoregulatory system is around ±35.5°C (1°C
below the vasoconstriction threshold) [39,40]. Therefore a fast induction to
cross this threshold as quickly as possible seems indicated; additional
treatment can include a sufficient analgosedation, magnesium and
paralysation, but even the simple method of keeping the hands and feet
warm by wearing socks and gloves directly from the beginning of induction
of hypothermia can avoid shivering very reliably [41]. In patients with
traumatic brain injury undergoing temperature management, the benefit of
surface counter warming concerning less shivering and improvement of
metabolic profile was reported [42]. However, a high cooling rate during
induction with a combination of a feedback-cooling device and several
additional conventional cooling methods in combination with hand and feet
counter warming as described and a sufficient sedation level seems to be
the best way to avoid shivering. In addition, every temperature
management procedure requires a reliable core temperature. The gold
standard is still the temperature taken directly in the bloodstream (for
example, pulmonary catheter) or directly by the cooling device itself as
possible with the Philips Accutrol endovascular catheter. Other common
places for temperature measurement are the bladder by Foley catheters,
oeosophageal probes, tympanic and rectal temperature [43]. Modern
temperature management systems with high cooling rates lead to a fast
induction of hypothermia that can only be detected by most temperature
sensors with a time delay. The closed approach towards the gold standard
might be the oesophageal measurement with an approximately average
time delay of 5 minutes (range 5 to 10 minutes) [40].
Conclusion: A wide range of conventional and technical methods exists to
apply mild therapeutic hypothermia after cardiac arrest. Hoedemaekers and
colleagues compared all described different methods (conventional cold
infusion/ice, water blankets, gel-coated pads, intravascular) in ICU patients
regarding the speed of cooling (°C/hour) and the reliability to maintain a
stable target temperature. The authors conclude that water-circulating
blankets, gel-coated pads and intravascular cooling are almost equally
efficient for induction but intravascular methods were superior for
maintaining the target temperature [44]. Some performance data might
have changed over the last years due to the industry having developed the
next generation of cooling devices. However, every method has its own
partly limited, indication and a combination of an automatic computer￾processed feedback device with conventional methods seems a good and
safe solution. The type of feedback device used in a hospital (invasive vs.
non-invasive) depends on several factors but mainly on the personal
preference of the treating doctors, type of patients and the local standard as
well. In addition, the way of thinking is changing and it is no longer a
question of making the patient cool as good as possible but rather has
evolved into a complex temperature management procedure with its own
risks and pitfalls as well as benefits for the patient. It is a precondition to
ensure a precise and tight temperature control during all three treatment
phases. Especially during rewarming, which is a very critical phase of
temperature management, close temperature monitoring is necessary and
can be easily achieved with a computer-feedback cooling system. A passive,
uncontrolled increase of temperature should be avoided in the modern
temperature management approach. However, the adoption rate and
implementation of hypothermia as part of standard post-arrest care is still
not high enough. Reasons are manifold but the latest version of available
cooling devices may be able to help to increase the application rate by
making the treatment safe and easy. If the hospital team feels confident
with the topic of temperature management, numbers of operators might
increase, even if the number of cardiac arrest patients treated in a hospital is
low.
The presentation of different temperature-management methods and
interpretation of their efficiency in the age of daily breaking news about
mild hypothermia treatment and widening of the indication can only be
a momentary snap-shot and cannot aspire to completeness.

Introduction: Guidelines for using inotropic drugs to support cardiovascular
function at low core temperatures are not well characterized. The safe
application of inotropic drugs during normothermic conditions, routinely
used to treat cardiovascular instability by effectively increasing cardiac
output (CO) and improve end-organ perfusion associated with acute heart
failure [1], is based on a detailed understanding of pharmacodynamics and
pharmacokinetics of these drugs. Detailed knowledge of temperature￾dependent changes in pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of such
cardioactive drugs is essential for establishing treatment guidelines.
Therapeutic hypothermia: Over the last decade therapeutic hypothermia
has been established as a recognized intervention to increase survival and
improve neurologic outcome in adult comatose cardiac arrest survivors
[2-6]. However, after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and coronary
revascularization, more than 50% of survivors suffer from acute heart
failure and need inotropic cardiac support to resume adequate circulatory
function [2] after induction of hypothermia when the core temperature is
deliberately lowered to 34 to 32ºC and maintained for 24 to 48 hours. In
contrast, in patients hospitalized for acute heart failure without
hypothermia a subgroup of about only 10% received inotropic drugs [7].
Accidental hypothermia: Another group of patients in need of inotropic
drug therapy at low core temperature are accidental hypothermia patients
displaying hypothermia-induced cardiac failure during rewarming, ranging
from mild reduction of CO to the fulminant circulatory shock termed
rewarming shock [8-11]. Rewarming shock is a clinically descriptive term that
refers to a pathophysiologic state of cardiovascular collapse taking place
during or after rewarming from accidental hypothermia [12], recognized as a
progressive reduction of CO and a sudden fall in arterial blood pressure. In
order to treat or prevent rewarming shock, cardioactive inotropic drugs are
commonly necessary to elevate a low CO.
Research in experimental hypothermia has displayed a substantial
depression of LV myocardial function in earlier studies [8,11,13] as well as
Critical Care 2012, Volume 16 Suppl 2
http://ccforum.com/supplements/16/S2
Page 8 of 42

in recent studies [9,13,14]. Based on the results from these studies,
cellular calcium overload, disturbed calcium homeostasis, changes in
myocardial myofilament responsiveness to intracellular calcium as well as
impaired high-energy phosphate homeostasis could all be proposed as
important factors leading to the changes observed in the hypothermic
heart and contributing to failure of functional recovery during rewarming
[15-18].
β-receptor agonists: In the acutely failing heart postoperatively, only
drugs such as epinephrine and NE provide positive inotropy and perfusion
pressure. Epinephrine acts through stimulation via sarcolemmal b￾adrenoceptors, causing phosphorylation of the sarcolemmal L-type Ca2+
channel via cyclic AMP and protein kinase A pathways. This phosphorylation
increases the open probability of the channel [19], allowing for greater
trans-sarcolemmal Ca2+ influx with each depolarization and producing, in
part, the positive inotropic effect of epinephrine.
Vascular effects: Only a few experiments studying effects of epinephrine
during hypothermia or/and rewarming using in vivo animal models have
been published. Some authors report that both b1-adrenoceptors and a￾adrenoceptors increase their sensitivity to catecholamines during
hypothermia [18,20-22] as b1-adrenoceptor activity was potentiated by low
temperature, and they claim the existence of hypothermia-induced
supersensitivity and increased agonist activity for b1-adrenoceptors. In
support of this view, a left shift of the concentration-response curve for
epinephrine during hypothermia has been reported [23]. However, others
suggest hypothermia-induced increase in sensitivity for both a1-
adrenoceptors and a2-adrenoceptors during cooling [24], but that sensitivity
of b1-adrenoceptors is not increased to the same extent as a-adrenoceptors.
In contrast, other researchers have reported a hypothermia-induced
supersensitivity of b1-adrenoceptors [18,20,21]. Rubinstein reported that
hypothermia modified the vascular response to epinephrine [25]; that is, the
epinephrine doses that induced vasodilation during normothermic
conditions increased TPR at 25°C. He also claimed that myocardial
contractile effects of epinephrine is reduced at low temperatures (covered
below), a view also supported by others [25,25-27]. Experimental data show
that the sympathetic nervous system could be switched off at a threshold
temperature about 29°C and hypotensive patients with temperatures below
this may benefit from infusions of exogenous catecholamines [28]. In
addition, if CO could be elevated pharmacologically, rewarming by any
means becomes more efficient [17,29]. Some researchers recommend
infusion of low doses of catecholamines in patients who have lower blood
pressure than would be expected for that degree of hypothermia and who
are not responding to crystalloids and rewarming [29].
It therefore seems that the use of vasoactive drugs during hypothermic
conditions remains quite contradictory.
Cardiac effects: Some sources claim that the hypothermic heart is
unresponsive [30] or little responsive [31] to cardioactive drugs, and the last
reference as well as recommendation of the American Heart Association [26]
refer to the potential hazard of overmedication, due to delayed drug
metabolism leading to accumulation to toxic levels in patients suffering from
deep or severe hypothermia, if used repeatedly. The AHA recommends the
following algorithm for treatment of hypothermia: below 30°C i.v.
epinephrine should not be given, but above 30°C epinephrine should be
given, if indicated, but at longer than standard intervals. To date, there are
no prospective clinical studies to support the recommendation to avoid
epinephrine during hypothermic CPR, but a preclinical work report major
side effects of repeated epinephrine administration during experimental
hypothermic CPR in pigs [32]. Even in the last recommendations from the
AHA it was stated that treatment of severe hypothermia (temperature <30°C)
in the field remains controversial [26].
A reduction of CO and SV by inducing varying levels of hypercalcaemia
during hypothermia (28ºC) was reported by Schiffmann and colleagues [18].
Following infusion of epinephrine during these experimental conditions,
CO and SV were even more depressed [18]. These findings shear similarities
with findings in our intact animal models: infusion of epinephrine, which
theoretically will induce opening of Ca2+ channels, increase calcium
influx and elevate intracellular calcium even further, caused a significant
depression of myocardial function during hypothermic as well as post￾hypothermic conditions [13,33,34]. This made us conclude that hypothermia
and rewarming may cause alterations in the pharmacodynamic effects of a￾receptor and b-receptor mediated drugs [13,33,35-37] or induce changes in
receptor affinity for these drugs. Further, we found that low-dose
epinephrine managed to maintain positive inotropic effects on LV cardiac
function during cooling to 30ºC, but these effects vanished during cooling
to 28ºC. If the epinephrine dose was increased at these low temperatures SV
and CO were not elevated but a significant increase in afterload took place.
Thus we conclude that if epinephrine is applied during hypothermia the
therapeutic window appears narrow with short distance to unwanted side
effects. Further, the prehypothermic dose-dependent increase in LV function
in response to epinephrine was not present after rewarming in the group
that had received epinephrine during hypothermia [13,33,35,38], and if
epinephrine was infused during rewarming vascular side effects of
epinephrine (vasoconstriction) dominated [13,38] without elevating CO
above pre-hypothermic control values at any temperature.
During cooling there is a reduction in Ca2+ sensitivity of troponin C due to
protein kinase A (PKA)-induced phosphorylation of troponin I [39], in
addition to the hypothermia-induced calcium overload [18,19]. Further, it is
documented that PKA may inhibit the activity of adenylyl cyclase (AC)
5 [40,41], predominantly expressed in the heart [42], which catalyzes ATP
to cAMP. Based on this information, it is possible that lack of positive
inotropic effect on cardiac function of b-receptor stimulation during
hypothermia may be due to the inhibitory effects on AC 5 activity of PKA
phosphorylation and/or a potential desensitization and internalization of
the b-adrenoceptor. Another way of interpreting these results is that the
efficacy of signal transduction through G-protein coupled receptors
is rapidly decreased through mechanisms like desensitization and
internalization, mechanisms that will avoid receptor overstimulation.
However, during pathologic conditions, like acute heart failure following
acute coronary syndromes and cardiac standstill, or as a consequence of
exposure to accidental hypothermia, it is necessary for cardiac myocytes to
produce cAMP over the limitation of such adaptations.
Dopamine: The still widespread use of DA in perioperative and intensive
care, the explicit recommendation for its use in accidental hypothermia
guidelines, and possible positive effects in hypothermia as reported from
experimental studies all need evaluation. From experimental hypothermia
research we found that DA improved both systolic and diastolic function in
hypothermia [43]. However, at 25°C no beneficial effect was seen on CI as SI
decreased with incrementing DA dosages. Increased SVRI at high-dose DA at
25°C suggests a-adrenergic involvement not seen in normothermia.
Properties of the low-flow, high-viscosity circulatory state, combined with
serious alterations in the pharmacokinetics of DA, may explain lack of
beneficial - and potentially harmful - effects from DA administration at 25°C.
Milrinone: Milrinone is a phosphodiesterase (PDE) 3 inhibitor that is
dominantly expressed in the heart and vascular tissues. The site of action of
milrinone is cytosolic, and the administration of a PDE3 inhibitor increases
cAMP only in the cardiovascular system, which subsequently enhance
cardiac contraction and induce vasodilation during normothermic
conditions [44]. In a recent experiment [45], using milrinone as a model drug
of intracellular mode of action, the positive cardiac effects of this drug was
demonstrated during normothermic conditions (30% increase in SV and CO)
and remained during cooling to 15ºC. These effects of milrinone on cardiac
function stay in essential contrast to those in our previous studies testing
effects of a-receptor and b-receptor mediated drugs [35,38] during cooling
and rewarming.
Conclusion: Taken together, the use of cardioactive drugs during hypo￾thermic conditions remains quite contradictory. Therefore, pharmacologic
treatment applied during the clinically challenging modalities, therapeutic as
well as accidental hypothermia, call upon written treatment protocols or
guidelines that are so far largely missing or at least not properly updated.
More research is needed to explore temperature-dependent changes in
pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of cardioactive drugs to write
these guidelines. Thus, due to significant hypothermia-induced alterations of
cardiac as well as vascular adrenoceptor sensitivity, the use of cardioactive
agents not affecting these receptor systems are advised during hypothermic
conditions.

Pathogenetic mechanisms of heatstroke and novel therapies

Heatstroke, a life-threatening condition defined by a rapidly increasing core
temperature greater than 40°C and multiple organ system dysfunction, is a
leading cause of morbidity and mortality during heat waves [1]. The heat
wave that affected Europe during August 2003 led to an unprecedented
70,000 excess deaths of which up to 40% were confirmed to be due to
heatstroke [2]. Sophisticated climate models predict increasing frequency
and severity of heat waves and so the incidence of heat-related death could
rise if proactive measures and novel therapy to address this threat are not
adopted [3].
The mechanisms of multiple organ system dysfunction in heatstroke are not
fully understood and include direct tissue injury and cell death resulting
from heat cytotoxicity together with delayed organ dysfunction and
damage secondary to activation of inflammatory and coagulation pathways.
Histopathological changes include endothelial injury, disseminated
intravascular thrombosis, neutrophils infiltration and apoptosis [4,5]. Despite
cooling and optimal treatment in intensive care the overall mortality from
heatstroke exceeds 60%, due in large part to the fact that no specific
treatment is available [6,7].
Experimental evidence from rodent models of heatstroke suggest that
immunomodulation of the host response may alter the clinical course of
Critical Care 2012, Volume 16 Suppl 2

Page 10 of 42

heatstroke and thereby improve outcome [8-10]. Heatstroke in induces
systemic and local (central nervous system) production of TNFa and IL-1,
and severe coagulopathy. This is associated with multiple organ system
dysfunction including severe neuronal injury, and high mortality.
Administration of an IL-1 receptor antagonist [8], corticosteroids [9] or
activated protein C [10] before the onset of heatstroke attenuates the
multiple organ system dysfunction and improves survival. However,
extrapolation of these data from these small animal models to humans is
problematic because of inter-species differences.
Baboons represent the most appropriate model for the study of the host
inflammatory and hemostatic responses to heat stress and their relation to
cellular injury and death as well as for testing novel therapy, which targets
these pathways. Moreover, the findings may have direct applicability to
human heatstroke, and could represent the basis for clinical trial. In this
review, we show that baboons subjected to heat stress reproduce both the
clinical and immunological changes similar to those seen in humans [11].
Using this experimental model, we report that immunomodulating the host
systemic inflammatory and coagulation responses failed to translate
into improved survival, suggesting that further basic research on the
pathogenesis of heatstroke is required [12-14].

Is therapeutic hypothermia immunosuppressive?
Kees H Polderman

Center, Pittsburgh, PA, USA

Introduction: The answer to the question in the title of this article would
appear obvious. Even the term ‘to catch a cold’ is partly based on the
widely-held assumption that lower temperatures or a chill can decrease
the resistance to certain viral infections such as the common cold [1].
Furthermore, a number of studies have clearly demonstrated that
inadvertent decreases in temperature in the perioperative setting, and in
some other situations, can significantly increase infection risk.
However, the question is not as easy to answer in cases where hypothermia
is applied deliberately and with various precautions, which is the case in
therapeutic cooling. In these cases potentially harmful responses such as
shivering and tachycardia are carefully controlled, body temperatures are
not allowed to drop below a predefined setpoint, and every effort is made
to prevent side effects [2,3]. Moreover, even the evidence that hypothermia
plays a role in the development of the common cold is mixed, and the few
studies performed to address this issue did not support the popular belief
that colds are associated with exposure to a cold environment [1,4].
The relationship between hypothermia and immune function are briefly
discussed below.
In vitro studies and animal experiments: In most types of acute brain
injury there is a significant and protracted inflammatory response in the
hours following the acute event, whether this is ischemic, traumatic, or a
combination of both. Proinflammatory mediators such as TNFa and IL-1
are released in large quantities by astrocytes, microglia, and endothelial
cells following an episode of ischemia and reperfusion [2]. The levels of
these mediators begin to rise around 1 hour after injury and remain
elevated for up to 5 days [2,5,6]. This in turn stimulates the chemotaxis of
activated leucocytes across the blood-brain barrier and leads to an
accumulation of inflammatory cells in the injured brain, as well as the
emergence of adhesion molecules on leukocytes and endothelial cells.
Simultaneously activation of the complement system occurs, beginning in
the very early stages after brain injury. This further stimulates the passage
of neutrophils and (in later stages) monocytes/macrophages [6]. These
inflammatory and immunological responses occur especially during
reperfusion and are accompanied by free radical production (see below).
These inflammatory responses can cause significant (additional) injury
through the phagocytic actions of macrophages, synthesis of toxic
products, and further stimulation of immune reactions in a vicious cycle.
Thus it can be argued that, at least in the initial stages of acute brain injury,
a hyperinflammatory state exists. As explained in some more detail below
hypothermia attenuates this proinflammatory state, but this in itself does
not constitute immune suppression. On the other hand, it should be realized
that the proinflammatory response outlined above is to some extent
physiological; there is evidence suggesting that some inflammatory
mediators have neuroprotective properties, although many others are
neurotoxic [6-9]. Thus attenuating the response could have protective
effects, but also some detrimental ones [2,8,9].
On balance there is persuasive evidence suggesting that the production of
cytokines and leukocyte infiltration is disproportionate and harmful, and can
significantly increase the risk and extent of brain cell injury and infarction
[6-15]. Especially, the IL-1 family appears to be important in this regard [15].
The destructive aspects of inflammation appear to outweigh the potential
benefits especially in the later stages of injury [2,6-9]. Thus there is a
potential time window for therapeutic interventions to block or mitigate this
process before it causes permanent injury.
Many animal experiments and in vitro studies have shown that mild
hypothermia can suppress harmful inflammatory reactions that damage
potentially viable nerve cells and astrocytes [10-12]. Hypothermia can also
decrease production of leukotrienes and nitric oxide, prevent reperfusion￾related DNA injury and lipid peroxidation, and impair neutrophil and
macrophage function [2,3]. Thus on balance the protective effects of cooling
are likely to outweigh the potential negative effects. However, this does not
mean that there are no negative effects, especially if the temperature drops
below 32°C. It should be kept in mind that the suppression of inflammatory
responses will occur in all organs, not just the injured ones; this is one of the
reasons why inhibition of the immune response can lead to increased
infection risk. Moreover, the effect is present regardless of whether a local or
general hyperinflammatory state exists.
The systemic effect on the immune system can be enhanced by a decrease
in the white blood cell count, which can begin at temperatures below 32 to
33°C (although major decreases usually occur only at temperatures below 30
to 31°C). Biggar and coworkers reported a drop in WBC count from 6.0 ± 0.6
to 2.3 ± 0.3 when hypothermia of 29°C was induced in pigs [16]. They did
Critical Care 2012, Volume 16 Suppl 2

Page 11 of 42

not observe significant changes in the number of circulating mature or
immature neutrophils, and reported that neutrophil demargination after
administration of intravenous catecholamines was similar at 37°C and 29°C.
However, they also observed that administration of corticosteroids and,
importantly, of endotoxins failed to stimulate the normal release of
neutrophils from the bone marrow [16]. Failure of this response could
significantly impact infection risks [2].
Most of these observations were made in animal experiments, but the
hypothermia-induced suppression of the hyperinflammatory responses
and decrease in WBC count have been confirmed in clinical reports in
humans with traumatic brain injury [10,11,17].
Thus the very mechanisms that provide tissue protection could
simultaneously impair the patients’ ability to fight infections. In addition,
lowering body temperature can lead to a decrease in insulin secretion and
to induction of insulin resistance [2,3]. This can lead to hyperglycaemia,
which can in turn impair leucocyte function and further increase infection
risks. Finally, hypothermia can cause vasoconstriction in the skin, which
could increase the risk for bedsores and surgical wound infections.
In summary, based on the in vitro evidence we would expect hypothermia
to inhibit the mostly harmful neuroinflammatory response and ameliorate
the hyperinflammatory state that occurs after acute injury, but at the price
of increasing infection risk.
Clinical evidence: Clinical studies reporting the infection risks associated
with therapeutic cooling in different categories of patients with acute
brain injury have produced divergent results; studies in patients who
develop accidental hypothermia have mostly reported higher infection
risks.
The link between accidental hypothermia in the perioperative setting and
a higher incidence of surgical wound infections was first demonstrated by
Kurz and coworkers in 1996 [18], and has since been confirmed in
numerous studies in various categories of surgical patients [19-26]. The
most recent example is a study by Seamon and coworkers, who found that
intraoperative hypothermia (below 35°C) was independently associated
with surgical site infection rates after trauma laparotomy [26]. Local factors
such as hypothermia-induced vasoconstriction in the skin may add to the
underlying immunosuppressive effect to further increase the rate of
wound infections. Recently, Laupland and colleagues reported that severe
hypothermia (<32°C, but not 32 to 35.9°C) was associated with significant
increases in risk for infections acquired in ICU [27].
The link between hypothermia and infections is far less clear when mild
hypothermia is induced under controlled circumstances. Numerous studies
in patients with post-hypoxic brain injury following cardiac arrest have not
reported significant increases in rates of infections, although some have
reported trends in that direction [28]. Seven multicentered trials in newborn
babies treated with neonatal asphyxia for 48 to 72 hours also did not report
consistent increases in infection risks [28].
In contrast, clinical studies in patients with ischemic stroke and TBI have
tended to find higher risks of infection, especially pneumonia, in patients
treated with hypothermia. For example, Hemmen and coworkers reported a
rate of pneumonia of 50% in patients with ischemic stroke treated with
hypothermia and thrombolysis, compared to 10% in controls [29]. Although
the overall outcome was better in hypothermia patients in spite of the high
infection rate, this indicates that use of hypothermia in these patients may
present significant difficulties.
Some studies using hypothermia in patients with severe traumatic brain
injury have also reported high infection rates [28]. There is evidence that
this can be prevented by a combination of preventive measures, perhaps
including use of antibiotic prophylaxis such as selective decontamination
of the digestive tract (SDD) [28,30,31].
In one example, Kamps and coworkers reported on their use of prolonged
therapeutic cooling to control intracranial pressure in patients with severe
traumatic brain injury, in a setting where SDD was routinely used, and
reported that infection rates were 20% in patients treated with hypothermia
and 34.4% for matched controls [31]. Most notably, the risk of ventilator￾associated pneumonia was the same in patients treated with hypothermia
compared with matched controls.
Conclusion: Hypothermia impairs immune function and inhibits various
inflammatory responses. This is inherent to the treatment, and impairment
of harmful inflammatory reactions in the brain may be one of the
mechanisms through which hypothermia can exert protective effects.
Hypothermia-induced insulin resistance and hyperglycemia may further
increase infection risks. In clinical studies, hypothermia has been most
clearly linked to infection risk in the context of accidental hypothermia;
controlled therapeutic cooling appears to carry a lower risk, especially if
hypothermia is used for limited periods of time (<48 hours). The risk appears
to increase with prolonged use, and careful monitoring is required in these
patients. Prophylactic antibiotics may be considered in high-risk patients
who are cooled for prolonged periods.

Shivering: scores and protocols
Neeraj Badjatia
Neurological Institute of New York, Columbia University College of Physicians
and Surgeons, New York, USA
Critical Care 2012, 16(Suppl 2):A9
Shivering is both an anticipated consequence and, potentially, a major
adverse effect of therapeutic hypothermia. Even mild hypothermia can elicit
a vigorous thermoregulatory defense to maintain body temperature at the
hypothalamic set point. In healthy humans, peripheral vasoconstriction is
triggered at 36.5°C and shivering at 35.5°C. Temperature thresholds for
vasoconstriction and shivering are often higher than normal in brain-injured
patients; therefore, these thermoregulatory defenses may occur more
vigorously and at higher temperatures in these individuals. Control of
shivering is essential for effective cooling, as shivering fights the cooling
process, makes attaining target temperature difficult, is extremely
uncomfortable, and can trigger massive increases in systemic and cerebral
energy consumption and metabolic demand. The first step in treatment is
adequate tools to recognize shivering. The Bedside Shivering Assessment
Scale is a simple, validated four-point scale that enables repeated
quantification of shivering at the bedside. Therapy for shivering should
ideally stop or suppress the central thermoregulatory reflex rather than just
uncoupling this response from skeletal muscle contraction, as the latter
approach does not mitigate the ongoing cerebral and systemic stress
response. Analgo-sedation with opioids, a2-receptor agonists, or propofol is
almost always effective as a last resort to prevent shivering. However,
nonpharmacological strategies as first-line interventions for shivering
minimize the risk of excessive sedation, which can make neurological
examination difficult and increase the risk of complications. The Columbia
Anti Shivering protocol has been developed with these strategies in mind,
and we base our approach on prospectively collected cooling data on 213
patients who underwent 1,388 patient-days of temperature modulation.
Eighty-nine patients underwent hypothermia and 124 patients underwent
induced normothermia. In 18% of patients and 33% of the total patient￾days, only none-sedating baseline interventions were needed. The first
agent used was most commonly dexmeditomidine half the time, followed
by opiates and increased doses of propofol. Younger patients, men, and
lower body surface area were factors associated with increased number of
anti-shivering interventions. As noted by this protocol, a significant
proportion of patients undergoing temperature modulation can be
effectively treated for shivering without oversedation and paralysis.
Patients at higher risk for needing more interventions are younger men with
decreased body surface area.

Controlled prophylactic normothermia

Neurologic Intensive Care Unit, Medical University Innsbruck, Austria
Critical Care 2012, 16(Suppl 2):A10
Introduction: Fever is a very frequent complication of intensive care
treatment and an independent predictor of unfavourable outcome and
mortality in most patients with an acute severe neurologic injury. Today not
only treatment but even more prevention of fever has become the focus of
intensivists.
Preliminary animal data for the beneficial neuroprotective effect of
therapeutic hypothermia could not satisfyingly be reproduced in patients
raising questions about the possible side effects of hypothermia. Controlled
prophylactic normothermia (36.5°C) prevents secondary injury through
consequent treatment of fever and limits dose-dependent side effects
through therapeutic hypothermia. Novel endovascular and gel-pad surface
cooling measures have shown to be feasible and efficacious in inducing and
maintaining even long-term controlled normothermia.
Rationale for treatment of fever: Fever is one of the most frequent
complications of intensive care treatment. Up to 90% of patients develop
at least one febrile episode within 7 days after being admitted to an ICU
[1]. First of all, fever has always to be interpreted as a sign of an infection.
Thus temperature modulation by any means has to include a strict
protocol identifying any source of infection followed by a straightforward
treatment approach. There is widespread consensus that fever alone is
associated with unfavourable outcome. This consensus is a result of animal
and human data over the past decades. In a meta-analysis conducted by
Greer and colleagues including more than 14,000 patients, fever alone was
a significant and independent predictor of morbidity and mortality across
such different diseases entities as ischaemic stroke, haemorrhagic stroke
and traumatic brain injury [2]. Increasing evidence from animal and human
studies suggests that fever, irrespective of its cause, can directly and
adversely affect neurological outcome in various types of neurological
injury [3].
The pathophysiological mechanisms by which fever affects patient outcome
are discussed, controversially comprising increase of metabolic demand
(under circumstances of reduced supply), production of free radicals, local
thermopooling, disruption of the blood-brain barrier, intracranial pressure
(ICP) elevation, increased enzymatic inhibition of protein kinases, and
worsened cytoskeletal proteolysis [1,3].
Concept of controlled prophylactic normothermia: The aggressive
treatment of fever in any patient with a severe acute neurologic injury has
become increasingly important and is now the focus of many prospective
studies including such patients. Whether the reduction of hyperthermia
alone or even controlled hypothermia should be the treatment goal is still
Critical Care 2012, Volume 16 Suppl 2

under debate and there are pros and cons for either approach. The
enthusiastic preliminary results from animal hypothermia studies could not
be satisfyingly reproduced when implemented in human controlled trials,
shifting the focus on the possible side effects of hypothermia. Today there
is a whole body of evidence that the potentially neuroprotective effects of
hypothermia can be significantly diminished by its inherent side effects. It
could be shown that hypothermia may lead to increased rate of infections,
hypotension, shivering, disturbances in blood clotting, rewarming injuries
and significant changes in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics
possibly limiting outcome effects of the treated patients [4-8]. Aggressive
treatment of fever in the ICU without risk elevation through the side
effects of therapeutic hypothermia led to the concept of controlled
prophylactic normothermia. This concept is based upon strict control of
body core temperature with a target of 36.5°C beginning as early as
possible with the goal of complete fever prevention. Prophylactic
controlled normothermia can therefore not be compared with the
normothermia control group of most randomised trials since this novel
approach aims to control temperature prophylactically and is therefore not
only treatment of fever.
Experiences from clinical trials: Controlled prophylactic normothermia
cannot be achieved through conventional temperature control measures
including NSAIDS and conventional cooling blankets [5,9]. In a controlled
trial conducted by our study group, reduction of fever burden (that is, body
core temperature >37.9°C) was significantly higher in the endovascular
cooling group than in the control group although strictly following a
predefined fever management protocol including NSAIDS, opioids and
conventional cooling blankets in patients with severe cerebrovascular
diseases [5]. In this trial an endovascular cooling catheter was placed in the
subclavian vein and prophylactic normothermia was maintained over
168 hours in patients with ischaemic stroke and intracerebral haemorrhage
and over 336 hours in patients with spontaneous subarachnoid
haemorrhage[5]. Safety evaluation revealed no relevant increase in direct
device-related adverse events in the endovascular group.
Although there was significant decrease of the fever burden in the device
group no difference could be found in the long-term, 6-month, patient
follow-up. This lack of outcome efficacy may be attributed due to the
increased rate of infectious complications in the device group again
pointing out that state-of-the-art temperature modulation has to be
combined with a standardised surveillance of infections [6].
In patients with severe traumatic brain injury (GCS ≤8) direct measurement
of brain temperature together with ICP is possible [10]. Since fever may
deteriorate elevated ICP, prophylactic controlled normothermia should be
evaluated in this patient population. In a small pilot trial, brain temperature
under endovascular cooling showed that even under normothermia (36.5°C)
brain temperature almost reaches body core temperature [11]. This is of
utmost interest as brain temperature exceeds body core temperature even
under physiological circumstances and even more under fever with a peak
gap >2°C [10]. As the brain is the target tissue of all neuroprotectants, it is
now evident that even controlled endovascular normothermia can
significantly lower brain temperature in TBI patients.
Others could achieve normothermia through a novel surface cooling
device using gel-coated energy transfer pads, directly applied to the skin
in patients with spontaneous subarachnoid haemorrhage and severe
traumatic brain injury [9,12].
Questions to be addressed in future trials: What is the optimal target
temperature and duration for temperature modulation in various disease
entities? What is the appropriate approach to inherent complications such
as shivering, infections, pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic
disturbances? Are surface and endovascular treatment approaches
equivalent?
Conclusion: Controlled prophylactic normothermia is not only fever
reduction but aims to strictly maintain the body temperature at 36.5°C.
Induced as early as possible the duration should cover the acute phase of
the neurological injury, minimising secondary additional neurological
impairment though prevention of fever. Endovascular and surface cooling
measures using gel-coated pads have shown to be efficacious and feasible
in inducing and maintaining normothermia whereas conventional
temperature control measures including NSAIDs and conventional cooling
blankets are not sufficient to prevent fever. Side effects known from
therapeutic hypothermia such as shivering and increased rate of infections
also may occur under controlled prophylactic normothermia, although to a
lesser extent. Nevertheless, a consequent prevention of those limiting
factors should be kept in mind when applying controlled prophylactic
normothermia.

Hypothermia has profound effects on the brain function but importantly is
potentially protective against both focal and global injuries. Aspects of the
biochemical response to acute ischaemia and trauma, which are associated
with poor outcome, can be inhibited by cooling. Unlike many pharmaco￾logical treatments that tend to antagonise a single neurochemical process,
hypothermia offers a simple method of inhibiting multiple pathological
processes simultaneously. It therefore has the potential, if applied correctly, to
improve outcomes after acute brain injuries, where drug trials have so far
failed.
The systemic cooling of patients after acute brain injury is an established
treatment modality in many neuro-ICUs. It is a strategy for protecting the
injured brain that makes intuitive sense and can reduce both intracranial
pressure and the potential for ischaemic secondary insults. Basic science
evidence also suggests that cooling can attenuate many secondary
biochemical cascades that are activated after acute injury.
However, despite these multiple lines of supportive evidence there is as
yet no confirmation from a high-quality randomised controlled trial that
prophylactic hypothermia improves outcome or reduces mortality.
This talk will look at the potentially beneficial effects of hypothermia on
the biochemistry of acute brain injury, consider the reasons for the failure
to demonstrate clinical efficacy and review the supportive data from

meta-analysis, suggesting how hypothermia might be best delivered.
Finally I will discuss EuroTherm3235, a European Society of Intensive Care
Medicine funded multicentre randomised controlled trial investigating
prophylactic hypothermia in traumatic brain injury, which draws on the
lessons from the available literature.

Historical considerations: In 1862 Edwin Smith, Egyptologist, acquired a
papyrus that was thought to be between 2,500 and 3,000 years old. It was
translated in 1930 by James Breasted, and was found to contain information
on medical therapies performed on 48 patients, including six cases of
cervical spine trauma. In the papyrus these injuries were described as
‘dislocation of the vertebrae of the neck with unconscious arms and legs,
where urine was drained and the phallus was erect, and it was determined
that this cannot be treated’ [1].
Other physicians like Hippocrates and Claudius Galen made historical
reference to the management of spinal cord injury. Galen studied injuries in
gladiators, and described ‘that injury of the spinal cord caused paralysis and
loss of sensation below the level of injury ... and determined that high spinal
cord injuries are incompatible with life’ [2,3].
Chaulic Guy (1300 to 1360) carried out innovations in the management of
traumatic bone injuries by introducing boards and suspensions to treat
these fractures; however, he gave a pessimistic view on spinal injuries
[4,5].
Ambrose Pare (1510 to 1590) developed spine surgery, and along with
Hildanus Fabricius (1560 to 1634) used traction techniques, reduction and
utilization of wood frames to treat cervical spine fractures [6].
Louis Pasteur’s (1822 to 1895) surgical innovations and discoveries and the
advent of asepsis and antisepsis by Semmelweis (1816 to 1868) and
others, and primarily the application of general anesthesia by Morton
(1819 to 1868) and others gave a new impulse to this field. Together these
developments helped reduce surgical mortality and infections [5,7].
In the nineteenth century, anatomy and physiology of the central nervous
system were studied. The neuron doctrine was developed by Santiago
Ramon y Cajal (1852 to 1934), who demonstrated the individuality of nerve
cells and the connections that they have with each other [8,9].
Alfred R Allen between 1908 and 1911 developed a reproducible and
quantifiable model that allowed induction of a uniform traumatic injury to
the spine, and also explained the pathophysiological changes seen in
spinal trauma, including key aspects of secondary spinal cord injury. In
1972 Tarlov showed that symptoms caused by compression of the spinal
cord for more than 12 hours could sometimes still be reversed. During this
period ‘progressive central hemorrhagic necrosis’ was identified, which
consists of bleeding from the gray matter of the spinal cord central
necrosis and destruction of white matter, with subsequent cavitations
[10,11]. Finally, one of the possible immunomodalities of neuroprotection
was suggested in 1968 by Albin and White who applied local hypothermia
with favorable results in animals [12]. However, use of hypothermia was
limited due to fear of side effects [13-17].
These preliminary studies were difficult to interpret due to the limited
number of patients, lack of controls, concomitant surgical procedures and
the concomitant use of drugs such as methylprednisolone [18]. In recent
years there has been a renewed interest in the use of moderate therapeutic
hypothermia due to its demonstrated neuroprotective effects in other areas.
In Panama, we have been administering therapeutic hypothermia in
selected cases with severe spinal cord injury. More frequently we apply fever
management through endovascular, surface pads or medical
thermomodulation protocols.
Epidemiological aspects of spinal cord injury: No accurate numbers on
spinal cord injury are available for Panama and Central America. In the
United States there are around 12,000 new cases of traumatic spinal cord
injury each year, not including those who die at the scene of the accident
[19]. Approximately 1.3 million Americans have some type of chronic
paralysis resulting from spinal cord injury [20,21]. The leading causes are
motor vehicle accidents (41.3%), falls (27.3%), acts of violence (15%) and
recreational activities (7.9%). Apart from the medical and personal
consequences for the patient, the economic impact in terms of ability to
work is significant.
Spinal cord injury, neurophysiological aspects - how can therapeutic
hypothermia help?: We will provide a concise description of the
pathophysiological changes that occur after a spinal injury that might justify
use of therapeutic hypothermia to mitigate ongoing destructive processes.
Spinal cord injury is a process that can be divided into three phases [22,23].
The primary mechanism refers to the direct mechanical damage. This may
include compression, stretching, persistent concussion, contusion,
compression and laceration of the spinal cord [22,23]. The secondary
mechanism involves a cascade of events at the cellular level triggered by the
primary mechanism. These biochemical events are responsible for increased
tissue damage and promote the apoptotic cascade. These include those
listed in Table 1. The healing mechanism (third mechanism) begins in the
days after injury and can last for months or years. This can paradoxically
increase the neurological damage. Healing in the primary injury takes place
by neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocytes, reactive astrocytes, Schwann
cells, meningeal fibroblasts, and microglia invasion. Scar formation forms a
barrier for cellular and molecular axonal regeneration.
Therapeutic hypothermia has been used in various types of neurological
injury such as stroke, post-anoxic encephalopathy, and traumatic brain
injury. Some of these results have been extrapolated to spinal cord
trauma patients.
Moderate therapeutic hypothermia has been shown to affect the apoptotic
cascade as well as other destructive mechanisms, ranging from improved
energy balance, reduction of mitochondrial dysfunction, decreased vascular
permeability and capillary leakage, mitigation of cell membrane injury,
improvement of intracellular acidosis, mitigation of DNA injury, reduction in
metabolic demand, and a decrease in proinflammatory cytokine and free
radical release [24-28].
It is important to realize that there is a window time, perhaps several hours
to days after the injury, during which this treatment modality can influence
the course of events [29].
Experimental studies and supporting evidence: Yu and colleagues
used therapeutic hypothermia (33°C) after 30 minutes of ischemic injury to
the thoracic spinal cord in rats, and reported improvement of motor
function at the microscopic level associated with cooling [30]. Others
reported improvements in functional outcome in various animal models
associated with cooling [30-32]. In an animal study of spinal cord ischemia,
hypothermia increased the duration of ischemia required to produce
neurological deficits [31].
Moderate hypothermia has also shown potential benefits in invasive
procedures including aortic clamp cross-clamping during thoracic surgery
[33,34]. This can be regarded as indirect evidence that hypothermia could
protect the spinal cord from ischemic injury, although the mechanisms in
traumatic injury may be different from surgical trauma and ischemia.
Fever is a common complication in patients with spinal cord injury [35-37].
Of the identifiable etiologies the most common cause is infection (especially
pneumonia and urinary tract infections). However, fever of unknown origin
is the most frequent diagnosis, occurring in 66% of patients. It should be
realized that patients with spinal cord injury have a high incidence of
thermoregulatory problems, which can contribute to the high incidence of
FUO [38,39].
Of note, Yu and colleagues demonstrated in an experimental study in rats
that post-traumatic hyperthermia in thoracic spinal cord injury worsened
behavioral and histopathological damage compared with normothermia,
and was associated with an increase of overall contusion volume by
increasing the vulnerability of both gray and white matter structures
compared with normothermia [40].

local hypothermia produced conflicting results [41]. However, the advent
of more reliable cooling devices that can better maintain body
temperature within a predetermined range have improved our ability to
deliver targeted therapy.
Hypothermia has been used to protect the spinal cord and prevent
paraplegia during high aortic cross surgery. In one study with long-term
follow-up, the incidence of spinal cord injury in patients undergoing high￾risk thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair under hypothermia over a 10-year
period the risk of SCI was 18% in hypothermic patients compared with
29% in historical controls (P <0.01) [29,33].
Interest in hypothermia for spinal cord injury received a boost when in 2007
a high-profile case was reported. An NFL player suffered a complete AIS A
cervical spine injury, and was treated immediately on the football field with
moderate hypothermia. This individual had a much better than expected
outcome and this led to a spate of publications on the potential use of
hypothermia for spinal cord injury [40,42-44]. Of course, such anecdotal
evidence cannot prove the benefit of any therapy, and professional
organizations such as the American Association of neurological surgeons,
Neurological and Spine Surgery Joint Sections and Joint Section of Trauma
concluded that there was currently not enough evidence available to
recommend or discourage the practice of therapeutic hypothermia as a
treatment for spinal cord injury [42,45-47].
In 2009 Levi and colleagues successfully tested the safety and feasibility of
systemic hypothermia induction in spinal cord injury with an endovascular
cooling device [48]. The authors treated 14 patients with AIS A spinal cord
injury with moderate hypothermia. At a median follow-up of 1 year they
found an improved conversion rate: in 6/14 cooled patients there was an
improvement of the neurological examination (three patients improved to
AIS B, two patients improved to AIS C and one patient improved to AIS D).
This represents an improvement rate of 42.8%, higher than the 12.5 to 20%
found in various other studies where patients had not been treated with
hypothermia [49,50]. Complications associated with cooling were mostly
respiratory issues (atelectasis and pneumonia) but these rates were similar in
the other studies where cooling had not been used. Adverse events such as
coagulopathy, deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism were not
reported in the patients treated with hypothermia. This is the first
investigation on the safety systemic cooling in acute spinal cord injury [48,51].
To determine efficacy will require randomized controlled clinical studies.
Currently there are plans to organize such a trial, which will involve 17
centers to determine whether moderate hypothermia improves outcome in
a larger population of patients with acute spinal cord injury. Details can be
found at online: http://www.miamiproject.org. The protocol calls for
induction of hypothermia within 6 hours of injury, to be maintained by
endovascular cooling, where they will evaluate the safety of different
durations of hypothermia, outcomes and risks [47].
Fever in patients with spinal cord injury, if not controlled promptly, may
lead to increased morbidity and mortality because of hyperthermic
damage to cells. Therefore controlling fever is an important goal of care in
these patients. Preliminary data suggest that endovascular cooling can be
used effectively for this purpose [52,53].
There are no proven treatments with high grades of scientific evidence
for the devastating consequences of spinal cord injury. In Panama,
selected patients with ASIA A lesions are treated with therapeutic cooling
for a period of 24 to 48 hours. This can be done in either mechanically
ventilated or nonventilated patients. Other aspects of treatment include
keeping adequate medullar perfusion pressure, normothermia throughout
their ICU stay (accomplished by pharmacological interventions,
mechanical cooling either with a surface cooling or endovascular device),
early enteral immunonutrition, and various tests such as somatosensory
evoked potentials.
Conclusion: So far there are no proven therapeutic interventions that
improve outcome in severe spinal cord injury. Hypothermia appears to be
a promising treatment in this population, and needs to be studied in
prospective clinical trials. Fever control should be a goal of care in these
patients.

Background: The ICTuS trial showed feasibility of endovascular
hypothermia for acute ischemic stroke [1]; ICTuS L confirmed safety and
feasibility of endovascular hypothermia during thrombolysis [2]. The ICTuS
2/3 study seeks to determine whether the combination of thrombolysis and
hypothermia is superior to thrombolysis alone for the treatment of acute
ischemic stroke. A phase 2 study will include 450 patients to assess the
safety of various protocol changes, to demonstrate sufficient recruitment,
and to allow an interim analysis for futility. If pre-specified milestones are
achieved the study will be enlarged to a 1,800-patient phase 3 efficacy
study.
Methods: This is a prospective, randomized, single-blind, multicenter phase
2/3 study. We aim to include ischemic stroke patients treated within 3 hours
of symptom onset with IV tPA (according to FDA or EMEA protocol), NIHSS
≥7 and ≤20, age 22 to 80. Patients are randomly assigned to either
hypothermia permissively targeted to 33°C or normothermia. Favorable
outcome is defined as a 90-day Modified Rankin score (mRS) of 0 or 1.
Secondary outcome measures are: 90-day NIHSS, Barthel Index (BI),
mortality, shift analysis of the mRS, global odds ratio of mRS, BI, NIHSS,
incidence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage and 90-day Montreal
Cognitive Assessment. An interim analysis for futility is planned near the end
of phase 2. In addition to futility, analyses will assess the frequency of target
temperature reached within 6 hours from symptom, pneumonia rate, safety
profile of iced saline infusion and study-wide average enrollment rate.
Results: The study team initiated 11 study sites in the USA and two in
Europe. Enrolment began in December 2010. Currently, 37 subjects are

enrolled. A full DSMB review of experience to date allowed the study to
continue enrollment. A safety review after the first 50 patients is
expected in late 2012.
Conclusions: ICTuS 2/3 is the largest trial of endovascular hypothermia for

Therapeutic hypothermia decreases growth of perihemorrhagic edema
and prevents critical increase of intracranial pressure in large
intracerebral haemorrhage

Background: Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) accounts up to 15% of all first￾ever strokes and is associated with high mortality, morbidity, and disability
[1,2]. Main factors contributing to poor outcome within the first days after
symptom onset are hematoma size, early hematoma growth, the presence
of intraventricular hemorrhage, and the size of perihemorrhagic edema
(PHE) [3]. PHE leads to secondary injury by a complex pathophysiological
cascade following ICH. Above all, mass effects of PHE can lead to critical
increase of intracranial pressure and subsequent herniation. Since the
volume of PHE increases within the first days after ICH and is correlated to
ICH volume, PHE represents a meaningful target for interventions [3].
Therapeutic hypothermia (TH) is a promising candidate to treat or even
prevent PHE. Experimental data indicate that TH is neuroprotective after
acute brain injury including ICH and reduces PHE [4]. In a proof of concept
study, we investigated the effects of mild TH of 35°C over a period of
10 days in patients suffering from large (>25 ml) ICH and compared these
patients with a historical control group [5]. Even with standard treatment,
ICH of this size has an extremely high mortality and almost never leads to
acceptable neurological outcome [2]. In our study, TH prevented the
increase of PHE and led to a superb in-hospital survival rate and an
acceptable long-term survival and grade of neurological deficits [5,6].
Because of these promising results, we established an institutional protocol
in the Department of Neurology at University Hospital Erlangen and treated
patients with large ICH with mild TH. Here, we report data of 20 patients
with large ICH treated in our neuro-ICU.
Materials and methods: All patients with large ICH were treated by a
detailed institutional protocol that is in line with our ongoing prospective
study [7]. Patients aged over 18 years with primary ICH at the level of the
basal ganglia or thalamus and a hematoma volume of over 25 ml on initial
CCT were treated by TH. Patients have been treated within the first 12 hours
after symptom onset if they had a score on the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)
of ≤8 at presentation or early worsening by 2 points with subsequent
endotracheal intubation and neurointensive care treatment. All patients
received invasive ICP measurement by external ventricular drainage or a
parenchymal probe. Relatives were informed about the treatment and
approved this regimen. Patients have not been treated by TH if any clinical
signs of herniation such as pupillomotoric defects or bilateral signs of the
pyramidal tract at baseline could be observed or the treating team agreed
to a do-not-resuscitate order. Laboratory exclusion criteria included an
international normalized ratio >1.5, a thrombocyte count below 70,000/μl or
leukocytosis >20,000/μl on admission. The presence of intraventricular
hemorrhage has not been an exclusion criterion, since we have a
standardized protocol, including external ventricular drainage,
intraventricular clot lysis and the use of lumbar drainage. Patients who have
been randomized to the control arm of our multicenter randomized
controlled trial CINCH [7] are not reported here.
Intervention of therapeutic hypothermia: Patients were treated with an
endovascular catheter-based cooling system (ICY catheter; Zoll Medical,
USA) positioned in the femoral vein as described previously [5]. The target
temperature has been set to 35.0°C. The body core temperature has been
measured by a urinary bladder catheter. As soon as body core temperature
drops below 36.0°C, patients are covered by a warming blanket to avoid
shivering. Ten days after initiation of TH, patients received slowly,
controlled rewarming by 0.1°C/hour. The catheter has been changed at
least once during the treatment period, preferably on day 4 ± 0.5 after ICH,
or if clinically indicated
Outcome analysis: Patients have been analysed for in-hospital mortality,
mortality and functional outcome (modified Ranking Scale and Barthel
Index) on days 90 and 180 after ICH.
Semiautomatic assessment of ICH and PHE volume: The Siemens
Leonardo V software for semiautomatic CT volumetry has been used for
assessment of hematoma and perihemorrhagic edema volumes. The
procedure has been described in detail before [3].
Statistical analysis: Statistical tests were performed with SPSS 16.0
software package. Data are given as mean ± standard deviation, if not
indicated differently. Normality of distribution was tested using the Shapiro￾Wilk and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests. Absolute edema values were not
distributed normally. Accordingly, single comparisons of absolute edema
between the two groups at different time points were performed using the
nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test. All other data were distributed
normally. The unpaired t test was used for single comparisons of ICH values
between the two groups. P < 0.05 was considered significant.
Results: Patient characteristics: A total of 20 patients have been treated
with mild hypothermia so far. There have been no significant differences
between these patients and our historic control group (n = 25; Table 1).
Overall, the volume of ICH in the initial CT was large with 57 ± 25 ml for
the hypothermia group and 59 ± 31 ml for the control group. The mean
volume of PHE after ICH has been calculated from cranial CT. Day 1
indicates the CT before start of hypothermia or standard treatment.
Rewarming was started at day 10. A significant difference (P < 0.05) of the
volumes at the specific day between the control and hypothermia group
was found [5].
Volume of PHE assessed in CT: While there was no significant difference
between the PHE on days 1 and 2, we found significantly higher volumes
of PHE in the historic control group on days 3, 6, 11, and 14. Importantly,
PHE did not increase after rewarming at days 11 and 14.
Complications of therapeutic hypothermia: ICP crisis: none of the
patients in the hypothermia group had ICP crisis, in contrast to 11 (44%)
patients in the control group.
We detected deep venous thrombosis in one patient in the hypothermia
group. Shivering appeared in nine (45%) patients and was treated
sufficiently by medication including meperidine and, if needed, muscle
relaxants. Pneumonia was the most common complication in hypothermia
patients. Nineteen (95%) of the patients developed pneumonia, three
suffered from ARDS and sepsis. In contrast, pneumonia appeared in 79% of
the control patients. Two (10%) patients in the hypothermia group had a
ventriculitis during external ventricular drainage. Five (25%) of the
hypothermia patients showed a decrease of thrombocytes. However, the
thrombocyte count never dropped below 80,000/μl and no complications
associated to this decrease could be detected. Four patients (20%)
developed bradycardia of below 40 beats per minute, but only one patient
received treatment due to bradycardia. One patient (5%) had a pulmonary
embolism during hypothermia. However, we could not detect deep venous
thrombosis or any other source for PE.
Clinical outcome: Eighteen patients survived the first 90 days after ICH.
Two showed a mRS of 3, seven had a mRS of 4, and eight a mRS of 5 after
90 days. Follow-up assessment after 1a showed that 17 patients survived
ICH. Of the surviving patients, 10 patients had a mRS of 3, 12 had a mRS of
4, and two had a mRS of 5.
Discussion: PHE develops early after ICH, causes an additional mass effect
after ICH, and contributes to secondary brain injury [3,4]. This mass effect
can be critical especially in large ICH and leads frequently to ICP crisis and
brain herniation [3,5,6]. Therefore, PHE is an important target for
therapeutic interventions. Animal experiments and clinical data show that
TH is a promising candidate for edema and ICP control [4-6]. We could
show in a previously published case series that TH decreased PHE and led
Critical Care 2012, Volume 16 Suppl 2

to acceptable short-term and long-term survival [5,6]. Therefore, we
implicated a TH as the standard care for large ICH in our institution and we
initiated a German-Austrian controlled multicenter trial to overcome the
shortcomings of our historical control group [7].
Here, we report results of the routine use of prolonged mild therapeutic
hypothermia in patients suffering from large ICH at the level of the basal
ganglia or thalamus. TH prevented the increase of PHE, prevented ICP crisis
and lead to an acceptable long-term outcome compared with the historical
control group. Importantly, rewarming did not lead to rebound edema as
measured by CT. However, TH was also associated with complications, of
which infections were the most frequent ones. As this study underscores the
promising results of our proof-of-concept study, we are looking forward to
the results of the CINCH study and other clinical data investigating the
effects of temperature and temperature management of PHE in large ICH.

Hypothermia in burns intensive care: use of the intravenous
temperature management system Thermogard XP®

Introduction: The care of the patient with major burns in the ICU is a
complex and challenging task. They differ from the other critical care
patient groups in several ways. One of the major challenges faced is
confronting their hypermetabolic state and temperature management [1].
It is widely known that major burn injury is associated with the most
profound of hypermetabolic responses to a pathological state. Hyperthermia
that is non-infectious is a feature of the systemic inflammatory response to
this. In burns intensive care, the disproportionate increase in metabolic rate
to small rises in core temperature can have significant impact on
resuscitation and prognosis. The pathophysiology of the hyperthermic
response in major burn injury is poorly understood. It could be secondary to
an infective etiology or a metabolic response to the systemic inflammation.
Irrespective of the reason, sustained hyperthermia above 40°C can culminate
in cellular injury and death [2].
The hypermetabolic response starts within the first 5 days of the major
burn and can last for a year after the injury. Because of the ongoing
systemic inflammatory stimulation, patients with major burns often have
pyrexia and their thermoregulatory system reset at a higher baseline
temperature around 38.5°C [3].
While therapeutic cooling is widely used in neuro intensive care in the
management of hyperthermic brain-injured patients and in patients after
out-of-hospital cardiac arrests, there is very scarce literature available on the
management of hyperthermia in burns intensive care. We, in this article,
would like to share our experience of using the intravascular temperature
management system (IVTM) Thermoguard XP® in our unit to manage
refractory hyperthermia in patients with major burns. We report the
responses of two major burns patients to core intravascular thermoregulation
during periods of severe hyperthermia (>40°C).
Case 1: A 24-year-old male had sustained 80% mixed depth, total body
surface area (TBSA) flame burns following a road traffic accident. He had no
significant past medical history. Initial resuscitation including endotracheal
intubation and fluid resuscitation was instituted in the nearby district
general hospital and was transferred over to our burns ICU without much
delay. On admission to the ICU, detailed assessment of the burn injuries
revealed second-degree and third-degree burns involving the trunk,
abdomen, back, upper and lower extremities. Initial temperature recorded
was 34°C. He responded to external warming, which included nursing in a
warm environment, use of warm air blanket and warm fluids.
The patient underwent extensive escharatomies on the day of admission as
a part of his initial resuscitation. He developed multiorgan failure requiring
high inotropic support, renal replacement therapy and high FiO2. He
developed hyperpyrexia (temperature >42°C) on day 11 post burn.
Relevant microbiology investigations had demonstrated no obvious focus
of ongoing infection. The hyperpyrexia was resistant to conventional
active cooling (bladder/gastric lavage, hemofiltration, external cooling
with cooling blanket). The hyperpyrexia was associated with marked
tachycardia (heart rate >150 beats/minute) with increasing oxygen
demands and hypotension with escalating inotropic support. Forced core
thermoregulation was commenced due to instability attributed to high
core temperature.
The Thermogard XP® was inserted in the femoral vein, the target
temperature was set at 37°C. Within 2 hours of initiating the IVTM, the core
body temperature dropped by 3°c down to 39°C. It took a further 3 hours to
stabilise at the target temperature of 37°C.
The IVTM system was used for a period of 6 days. The objective
measurements of pulse rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate and urine
output were seen to improve in the presence of a normothermic state
(Figure 1). After a protracted and convoluted stay in the ICU, the patient was
discharged to a ward after 38 days.
Case 2: A 34-year-old female, a known intravenous drug abuser, admitted
to burns ICU following an attempt of deliberate self-harm. The patient,
heavily drunk, allegedly grasped a high-voltage (400 kV) live wire on a
pylon and was found 15 feet away; she had sustained polytrauma

requiring splenectomy for splenic rupture and chest drains for
pneumothoraces. She had suffered deep thermal burns involving 27%
TBSA.
She had escharotomies on her both upper extremities and chest within
hours of admission. Patient subsequently developed rhabdomyolysis,
myoglobinuria and renal failure. The patient remained ventilated, requiring
ionotropic support and haemofiltration. She remained hyperpyrexial from
day 1 post burn; however, the temperature crept above 41°C on day 5 post
burn. The temperature was persistently high despite appropriate broad￾spectrum antibiotics, antifungal therapy and conventional methods of
cooling. Physiological instability led to the addition of forced core
thermoregulation on day 8. The target temperature of 37.5°C was achieved
over a period of 4 to 8 hours with resultant improvement in pulse and
respiratory rates and reduced inotrope levels (Figure 2). The forced core
thermoregulation was held periodically to assess the relapse of
hyperthermia and was reinstated as required.
Discussion: Thermoregulatory failure leading to elevation of core body
temperature more than 37.5°C (37.5 to 38.3°C) is hyperthermia. The core
body temperature is managed in a tight range by the balance of heat
production and heat loss.
The detrimental effects of hyperthermia on a patient in intensive care
cannot be overstated. Hyperthermia in adults with major burns is not
uncommon; however, the extent of the problem is not known. From
other cohorts like patients with brain injury, it is well known that
hyperthermia is an independent predictor of increased length of stay and
poor outcome in the ICU [4]. The impact of hyperthermia on various
organ systems and mortality depends on the degree of temperature
elevation and rapidity of cooling to normal temperatures.
Among the various methods to instigate therapeutic cooling in intensive
care, conventional methods could lead to treatment failure in as high as
60% of patients and the IVTM system is deemed most reliable to
maintain a stable temperature [5].
Forced core thermoregulation using the IVTM system is effective in
regulating labile body temperatures associated with severe burns [6]. The
thermoregulation is achieved by circulation of saline via a ballooned
catheter inserted into the central venous system, with automatic
adjustment of saline temperature controlled by remote monitoring of
patient temperature.
The downsides of using IVTM systems are the need for a central venous
access and complications related to it, cost factor and also use of
thermoregulatory systems may mask underlying physiological changes,
potentially leading to delayed or mismanagement of any precipitants of
hypothermia or hyperthermia, for example sepsis. Documentation of
an artificially maintained temperature on an observation chart without
reference to Thermogard XP® activity has implications for both
immediate patient management and retrospective review of
observation charts for audit or medico-legal purposes. Currently,
facilities to download data directly from the Thermogard XP® electronic
system are cumbersome and not readily available in most ward
settings. We devised and used a qualitative method of documenting
Thermoguard XP® activity. Firstly, a ‘T’ on the observation chart to
denote the presence of a Thermogard XP® in situ. Secondly, a number
assigned from a scale of +4 to -10 to represent the extent of warming
or cooling, correlating with the bars displayed on the Thermogard XP®
screen. These two pieces of information were documented alongside
the patient’s core temperature every time observations are performed.
We, in addition, developed an adhesive label that replicates the
cooling/warming scale displayed on the Thermogard XP® screen,
allowing an arrow to be documented on the chart as depicted on the
Figure 1(abstract A15) Response in vital parameters in the first
20 hours after initiating IVTM: case 1.

screen (Figure 3.) It provided a more visual representation
of Thermogard XP® activity and was used as an adjunct to the above
numerical scale. All members of the multidisciplinary team could
observe our method of documenting trends in core body temperature/
Thermoguard XP® activity at a glance. It is reproducible in any unit
caring for critically ill burns patients.
Conclusion: The directed response of hyperthermia in febrile and
nonfebrile states has physiological merits when considering the
requirements of inflammatory mediators and cells. Forced core
thermoregulation has aided us in the early management of unstable
intensive care patients with refractory hyperthermia.The use of an IVTM
system and subsequent documentation of artificially maintained
temperature can be misleading and has implications for patient
management and retrospective review.

Hypothermia after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage
Martin Seule*
, Emanuela Keller

Zurich, Switzerland
Critical Care 2012, 16(Suppl 2):A16
Introduction: Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a common
and frequently devastating condition, accounting for 1 to 7% of all strokes
with an incidence of 9.1 per 100,000 [1]. Major advances in SAH
management over the past three decades have decreased case fatality by
0.8% per year, but it is still 40% and many survivors have long-term
disabilities [2]. The most important and potentially treatable complication is
development of delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI), which can progress to
cerebral infarction associated with poor outcome.
The pathogenesis of DCI is multifactorial and assumed to be initiated in
the early phase of SAH [3]. The onset of SAH is characterized by a short￾lasting and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP)-dependent decrease in
cerebral blood flow (CBF) leading to global cerebral ischemia [4].
Elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) and acute cerebral ischemia are the
main factors for early disruption of the blood-brain barrier as well as
impairment of autoregulation associated with brain edema and brain
swelling. Important pathogenic mechanisms of CPP-independent
hypoperfusion include acute vasoconstriction, cortical spreading
ischemia, and activation of the inflammatory response. The release of
oxyhemoglobin and endothelin-1 (ET-1) are the key factors for cortical
spreading ischemia, reduced nitric oxide (NO) availability, and secondary
cytotoxic edema formation. Cerebral vasospasm (CVS) is a delayed
morphological narrowing of cerebral arteries, occurring 4 to 10 days
after SAH. Although CVS have been associated with DCI, it is generally
accepted that CVS is not solely responsible for DCI [5]. In fact, DCI
may occur in the absence of CVS and vice versa and the distribution of

CVS may fail to reliably predict the subsequent pattern of cerebral
infarction [6].
Neuroprotective strategies to prevent DCI have been mainly focused on
treatment of CVS, but despite extensive research, effective and/or causative
prophylaxis and treatment are not available [7]. So far, oral nimodipine is the
only drug that can reduce the incidence of DCI and poor outcome, but there
is no beneficial effect on CVS [8]. Hypothermia (HT) treatment exerting
numerous protective effects such as a decrease in cerebral metabolism [9],
stabilization of the blood-brain barrier [10], reduction of cerebral edema [11],
suppression of excitatory neurotransmitter concentrations [12] and
inflammatory reactions [13] seems to be well suited as a neuroprotective
strategy. In the following, the clinical application of HT after SAH is
presented by reviewing the existing literature.
Hypothermia during aneurysm surgery: In the past, promising studies
on intraoperative HT during aneurysm surgery as an attempt to reduce
ischemic injury have been published [14-18]. The Intraoperative
Hypothermia for Aneurysm Surgery Trial (IHAST) applied HT in a randomized
study in 1,001 patients with good-grade SAH (WFNS 1 to 3); however, it
found no improvement in neurological outcome 3 months after surgery
[19]. Post-hoc analysis demonstrated no difference in the incidence of
cognitive impairment between hypothermic and normothermic groups [20].
Furthermore, there was no evidence for the benefit of intraoperative HT on
24-hour and 3-month outcome in patients who underwent temporary
clipping [21]. It has to be noted that these results only apply to good-grade
SAH patients and may not be extrapolated to the general SAH population.
This suggests that only a carefully selected subgroup of patients, with
specific complications induced by SAH, may benefit from HT treatment at a
particular time and for certain duration.
Hypothermia in patients with poor-grade subarachnoid hemorrhage:
Several experimental studies have demonstrated that HT is effective in
minimizing neuronal damage, if induced before or early after the SAH.
Kawamura and colleagues found a reduced expression of c-jun and hsp-70
mRNA, indicating a reduced stress response that may otherwise manifest
as necrosis or apoptosis [22]. Thome and colleagues and Schubert and
colleagues demonstrated that early induction of HT, up to 60 minutes after
SAH, reversed CPP-independent hypoperfusion and brain edema formation,
preserved cerebral autoregulation, and reduced accumulation of lactate
and glutamate [11,12,23]. On the other hand, delayed induction of HT, up
to 180 minutes after SAH, failed to reduce brain edema formation, thus
indicating a limited time window of HT application [24]. However, HT was
effective in reducing ICP and associated with improved neurological
recovery. These studies encourage early induction of HT in poor-grade SAH
patients, for example, as soon as signs of brain swelling are seen on CT
scans.
So far, only few retrospective case series have investigated the effect of mild
HT during the acute phase of SAH. Table 1 presents an overview of these
studies applying HT within 24 hours after SAH to patients with poor-grade
SAH (WFNS 4 to 5). The duration of HT varied between 2 and 14 days.
Overall outcome results were unsatisfactory with a mortality rate of 47.4%
and favorable outcome in less than one-quarter of cases. Yasui and
colleagues evaluated seven patients admitted within 6 hours from symptom
onset and treated with HT for 48 hours [25]. PET studies during HT revealed
a reduction in cerebral oxygen metabolism exceeding the decrease in CBF,
thus indicating a state of luxury perfusion. However, according to the
Barthel Index only two patients were independent, one was partially
dependent, able to walk without assistance, and more than one-half of the
patients bedridden at 12 months after SAH. Anei and colleagues compared
outcome results before and after introduction of HT treatment to their
institution and found no significant difference in the mortality rate with
56.3% and 57.9%, respectively [26]. The authors noted that post-HT fever
can be a serious complication resulting in brain swelling and unfavorable
outcome. In contrast to these studies, Gasser and colleagues showed more
promising outcome results in 21 patients with poor-grade SAH (WFNS 4 to
5) and induction of HT after developing intracranial hypertension (>15
mmHg) that was refractory to conventional treatment. HT was induced on
average 4.2 ± 3.3 days after SAH and maintained for 4.3 ± 3.9 days.
Prolonged HT (>72 hours) was associated with an increased risk of systemic
complications, but 10 patients (47.6%) showed favorable outcome (GOS 4 to
5) and five patients died (23.8%).
Hypothermia in patients with delayed cerebral ischemia/cerebral
vasospasm: Recently, a SAH-CVS model in dogs demonstrated that HT
can attenuate the degree of CVS up to 14 days after SAH, possibly by
regulating the levels of ET-1 and NO [27]. The duration of HT was directly
proportional to the duration of relieving CVS. Table 2 presents an
overview of clinical studies applying HT to patients with symptomatic
CVS leading to DCI. Nagao and colleagues treated five patients with
good-grade SAH (H&H I to III), starting HT either during delayed
aneurysm clipping or if CVS was refractory to hyperdynamic and
endovascular therapy [28]. Four patients survived with favorable outcome
and one patient was severely disabled. In a follow-up study, Nagao and
colleagues included eight patients with good-grade SAH (H&H II to III),
and seven patients had favorable outcome and one survived severely
disabled [29]. According to SPECT studies, HT was associated with
decreased CBF levels in all patients. Nakamura and colleagues reported a
reduction in arterio-jugular oxygen difference (AVDO2) during HT in five
patients (H&H III to IV), thus indicating a reduced metabolic demand [30].
All patients received hyperdynamic therapy before and during HT, but
outcome results were unsatisfactory. Possible contributing factors of poor
outcome include a higher grade of SAH and it is unclear whether
endovascular treatment was applied or not. In our series of 100 SAH
patients treated with HT, 28 patients had symptomatic CVS refractory to
hypertensive therapy and endovascular treatment [31]. HT was combined
with barbiturate coma in 23 of 28 patients and maintained until CVS
resolved or severe side effects occurred (mean duration 5.7 ± 3.3 days).
Although the majority of patients had poor-grade SAH (H&H 4 to 5 in
57.1%, Fisher 3 to 4 in 85.7%), favorable outcome (GOS 4 to 5) was
achieved in 57.1%. In patients with intracranial hypertension (>20 mmHg)
with and without refractory CVS, favorable outcome was obtained in only
25.0% and 26.5%, respectively. Systemic side effects possibly caused from
HT and/or barbiturate coma included pneumonia in 52.0%,
thrombocytopenia (<100,000/µl) in 47.0%, septic shock syndrome in
40.0%, and acute respiratory distress syndrome in 16.0%. In a subgroup
of seven patients with combined HT and barbiturate coma, daily levels of
IL-6, IL-1b, TNFa, and leukocyte count in the cerebrospinal fluid and
plasma were quantified [13]. IL-6 levels in the cerebrospinal fluid and
systemic IL-1b levels were significantly lower compared with patients
receiving barbiturate coma alone (n = 8), thus indicating HT-related
attenuation of the inflammatory response.

Conclusion: So far, the evidence of HT on improved outcome after SAH
is limited. Intraoperative HT has been abandoned based on the
randomized Intraoperative Hypothermia Study on Aneurysm Surgery in
good-grade SAH patients. The available data suggest that HT may
improve outcome in a carefully selected subgroup of patients developing
intracranial hypertension and/or symptomatic CVS that are refractory to
conventional treatment. Further evaluation of cerebral hemodynamics
and oxygenation during HT treatment is required to obtain important
insights in the effects of HT and to identify patients who may benefit
most.

Background: When addressing neuroprotective effects and possible
indications of therapeutic hypothermia, several scenarios have to be
distinguished. First, therapeutic hypothermia can be classified based on the
depth of cooling from normal body temperature into mild hypothermia
(32 to 35°C), moderate hypothermia (28 to 32°C), deep hypothermia (28 to
17°C), and profound (<17°C). Second, therapeutic hypothermia can be
initiated prior to the insult, for preservation of tissue during the insult, or for
the reduction of reperfusion injury after an insult. Third, animal studies and
clinical trials have addressed the neuroprotective effects of therapeutic
hypothermia under conditions of both global and focal ischaemia. Forth,
additional parameters, for example, rewarming rate, duration of ischaemia,
and extent of reperfusion, influence the effects of therapeutic hypothermia.
Fifth, different outcome measures have been used to describe the effects of
hypothermia, for example, infarct size, extent of cellular death, and
neurologic condition at different time intervals after ischemia. Therefore,
whenever discussing procedures involving therapeutic hypothermia, the
aforementioned parameters deserve clarification.
Cerebral ischaemia: Cerebral ischaemia results from a reduction or
complete loss of cerebral blood flow (CBF) and lack of cerebral oxygenation,
followed by depletion of ATP, dysfunction of ATP-dependent membrane
pumps and subsequently occurrence of anoxic depolarisation. A large
amount of glutamate is released from the intracellular space into the
extracellular space, causing excitotoxic injury by stimulating N-methyl-D￾aspartate (NMDA) receptors and triggering calcium influx. Increased
intracellular calcium levels per se amplify injury by increasing calcium
permeability and glutamate release via second messenger mechanisms.
These acute cascades lead to necrotic neuronal death by interfering with
the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Ischaemia and reperfusion further
enhance excitotoxicity by providing oxygen as a substrate for several
enzymatic oxidation reactions, thereby generating products of reactive
oxygen species in large quantities. These free radicals enhance protein
oxidation and lipid membrane disintegration and in conjunction with blood￾brain barrier (BBB) disruption further contribute to ischaemic necrosis.
Apoptosis also occurs in cerebral ischemia, with antiapoptotic proteins being
selectively upregulated in surviving neurons and proapoptotic proteins
being highly expressed in dying cells.
Hypothermia in cerebral ischaemia: The first controlled attempts to cool
the human brain were undertaken by the neurosurgeon Temple Fay in 1938
[1]. Irrigating the brain directly with ice water and sometimes achieving solid
parenchymal freezing, he claimed ‘extremely gratifying results’ in a paper on
‘local and generalized refrigeration of the human brain’. Over time, many
mechanisms have been proposed regarding the neuroprotective effect of
hypothermia. First, hypothermia results in a temperature-dependent
decrease of oxygen and glucose metabolism; that is, a 10°C decrease in
temperature reduces ATP consumption and the cerebral metabolic rate
(CMR) of oxygen, glucose, and lactate twofold to fourfold [2]. Second, intra￾ischaemic hypothermia exerts inhibitory effects on many of the detrimental
ischaemic cascades, thereby retarding the initial ATP depletion, preserving
metabolic stores, delaying anoxic depolarisation, reducing ischaemia￾induced excitotoxic neurotransmitter release and intracellular calcium levels,
changing glutamate receptor regulation, and limiting BBB breakdown. Busto
and coworkers in 1987 reported that even 1 to 2°C temperature reductions
were sufficient to protect against experimental ischemic stroke [3], thereby
demonstrating that the aforementioned mechanisms can exceed the effects
of temperature-induced reductions in CMR, and in turn providing the
pathophysiologic foundation for mild and moderate therapeutic
hypothermia in the management of cerebral ischaemia.
Indications for therapeutic hypothermia: The importance of therapeutic
hypothermia has recently been emphasized by randomised trials in patients
with global cerebral ischaemia from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) [4]
and in neonates with perinatal hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) [5].
Clinical experience with patients suffering traumatic brain injuries (TBI) and
ischaemic strokes are not as convincing, although mild therapeutic
hypothermia was sufficient to control intracranial hypertension in this
population.
The use of therapeutic hypothermia in today’s OR theatres differs
significantly from the scenarios outlined in the context of OHCA, HIE, TBI,
or stroke. First, in the OR theatre hypothermia is induced beforehand in
expectation of a severe cerebral ischaemic challenge caused by the
surgical procedure. Second, underexperienced neuro-anaesthesiologist and
cardio-anaesthesiologic management, highly invasive procedures including
deep hypothermic cardiac arrest (DHCA) and selective cerebral perfusion
can be employed. In other words, whereas outside the OR mild to
moderate hypothermia is used to treat patients in the post-ischaemic
period, deep intra-ischaemic hypothermia can be used in cardiothoracic
and neurosurgery for the management of congenital heart disease,
thoracic aneurysms, and intracranial aneurysms; that is, interventions
provoking global cerebral ischaemia and otherwise resulting in devastating
intraoperative strokes. Moreover, mild hypothermia is used during
temporary parent artery clipping in cerebral aneurysm surgery, closely
resembling a state of mild intra-ischaemic hypothermia in a condition of
transient focal cerebral ischaemia.
DHCA in global cerebral ischaemia: Although DHCA is being used in
both cardiothoracic and neurosurgery and usually involves the same
principles of extracorporeal circulation under cardiopulmonary bypass
(CPB), the rationale behind these procedures is very different.
Hypothermic CPB and DHCA are established strategies of cerebroprotection
during cardiothoracic surgery. Cerebral circulatory standstill is an undesired
byproduct of this procedure and limits the possible safe duration of surgery.
To overcome this problem, methods of retrograde and antegrade cerebral
perfusion have been established [6]. Retrograde cerebral perfusion (RCP)
was initially considered to extend the safe operative time by both, backward
perfusion of the brain via the superior cava vein at pressures of 20 to
30 mmHg, and selective cooling of the brain parenchyma. It has become
evident that RCP indeed provides inadequate cerebral perfusion and exerts
neuroprotective actions mainly by providing additional cerebral cooling. In
contrast, antegrade cerebral perfusion (ACP) is obtained by intermittent
infusion of cooled blood directly into cerebral arteries. In detail, selective
ACP allows bihemispheric perfusion through direct cannulation of at least
two aortic arch vessels, whereas nonselective, hemispheric ACP uses the
axillary canula that is used for systemic perfusion as a route for ACP. From
the neurosurgical standpoint, not surprisingly, insufficient crossflow across
the communicating arteries at the circle of Willis with inadequate perfusion
of the contralateral hemisphere has been identified as an important
limitation for nonselective ACP. Although a final cooling temperature of
20°C or below with a long cooling time and gradual rewarming are
commonly advocated, promising results have been reported by some
groups using selective ACP with moderate hypothermia [7].
From the neurosurgical standpoint, the most important information from the
cardiothoracic surgical experience is the recommendation that the DHCA
time in sole application should not exceed 20 to 25 minutes and in every
case with expected DHCA time >25 minutes, ACP or RCP supplement should
be performed. In the field of neurosurgery, DHCA combines advanced
cerebroprotection with optimal surgical conditions; that is, a blood-free no￾flow surgical field and a collapsed aneurysm dome. Since the surgical
procedure requires cerebral exsanguination for rapid aneurysm repair, ACP
and RCP cannot be employed to dilate the time of DHCA, limiting the safe
no-flow period to 20 to 30 minutes.
Management algorithms for intracranial aneurysm surgery under DHCA
have been published previously [8-11]. Such advanced cerebrovascular
procedures require multimodality neuromonitoring and are performed
under barbiturate-induced EEG burst suppression. The decision to use

DHCA is usually made intraopertively; that is, hypothermia and cardiac
standstill are employed only after microsurgical exploration has proven
that safe aneurysm repair is impossible without these adjunctive
measures. In this case, brain retractor placement is adjusted, avoiding
further retractor repositioning - with the risk of contusional parenchymal
haemorrhage - after systemic heparinisation. Thereafter femoro-femoral
percutaneous cannulation is performed and after systemic heparinisation
(300 to 400 IU/kg) heart-lung extracorporeal circulation with a heat
exchanger and oxygenator is started. Once adequate CPB flow is achieved,
systemic hypothermia is induced. Cooling during extracorporeal circulation
is continued until a desired brain temperature of 14 to 18°C is reached.
Hypothermia results in ventricular fibrillation below 28°C and circulatory
arrest at 18 to 22°C. At this point CPB is stopped and blood is actively
drained into the venous reservoir, rendering the operative field blood free
and the aneurysm collapsed. The duration of this circulatory standstill is
limited to the duration of surgical aneurysm repair. In the largest reported
series [9], the mean duration of circulatory arrest was 21.8 minutes (range
2 to 72 minutes) with a mean temperature during circulatory arrest of
17.2°C (range 12 to 20°C). The decompressed aneurysm can now be
dissected circumferentially, adjacent vital perforating branches can be
separated from the aneurysm fundus, and in partially thrombosed lesions
the sac can be opened and evacuated. Some centres use short but
repetitive periods of circulatory standstill followed by periods of
reperfusion, thereby reducing the length of a single ischaemic period and
checking for bleedings in the operative field [12]. After aneurysm repair,
circulation is restored and under slow rewarming the heart starts to
fibrillate spontaneously and will either convert to sinus rhythm or will
require cardioversion. Pharmacologic peripheral vasodilation is used to
facilitate reperfusion, the blood previously drained is reinfused, and
heparin is reversed with protamine. Only after reperfusion, rewarming, and
reversal of heparin is adequate hemostasis possible in the operative field.
DHCA was used to treat intracranial aneurysms in the 1960s, but
shortcomings of CPB and hypothermia-induced coagulopathies resulted in
operative morbidity and declining use of the procedure. In the late 1980s,
refined microsurgical and anaesthesiologic techniques allowed the use of
DHCA for the management of most difficult intracranial aneurysms in
selected neurosurgical centres of excellence [8-11]. With the development of
new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, however, DHCA is only rarely
needed for the management of cerebral aneurysms today. Possible
explanations include the following. First, easy access to improved
neuroradiologic imaging techniques has resulted in the detection of
cerebral aneurysms at an earlier stage; that is, before they can grow to giant
size requiring the aforementioned surgical procedures. Second,
endovascular treatment, for example, flow diverter implantation [13] and
techniques of flow reversal, has become an alternative to surgery and
should in some instances be considered the first-line treatment; for example,
complex and giant posterior circulation aneurysms as well as patients with
significant co-morbidities. Third, techniques of cerebral revascularisation -
that is, parent artery occlusion under bypass protection - have proven highly
effective in the management of complex aneurysms [14]. Forth, alternative
strategies for intraoperative aneurysm decompression have been
discovered. Adenosine-induced cardiac asystole has emerged as a possible
alternative, resulting in brief repeated periods of cardiac arrest (5 to
15 seconds) to facilitate aneurysm clipping [15]. Others have used selective
brain cooling with extracorporeal femoral to carotid artery perfusion in giant
aneurysm surgery [16], a technique differing from DHCA in so far as the
patient’s body core temperature is maintained at 35°C and aneurysm
decompression is achieved by temporary clipping (trapping) of the parent
artery under selective brain cooling to 22°C. Another group has reported
successful treatment of a giant basilar artery aneurysm using moderate
hypothermia and extracorporeal circulation [12].
Even in expert hands, the procedural complication rate of aneurysm surgery
under DHCA is significantly higher than in ordinary aneurysm surgery. The
largest published series [9] reports a perioperative mortality of 14% and a
combined rate of permanent treatment-related morbidity and mortality of
32%. This recent study, however, reported a contemporary population
of patients harbouring complex aneurysms not lending themselves to one
of the aforementioned alternative treatment forms. In view of the otherwise
unfavourable natural course of these aneurysms, the reported 63% good
outcome rate justifies the procedure in a small subset of highly selected
patients. For the time being, DHCA should be considered a procedure of last
resort for otherwise untreatable aneurysms.
Intra-ischaemic mild hypothermia in focal cerebral ischaemia: The
situation of temporary parent artery clipping during cerebral aneurysm
surgery closely resembles animal models of transient focal ischaemia,
wherein intra-ischaemic hypothermia was more effective than delayed
post-ischaemic cooling and was more effective in transient ischaemia and
reperfusion models [17-23]. The IHAST trial included 1,001 good grade
(WFNS grades I to III) subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) patients
undergoing aneurysm surgery and randomised them to intraoperative
normothermia (36.5°C) versus mild intraoperative hypothermia (33°C).
Surprisingly, intraoperative hypothermia did not improve neurologic
outcome [24]. Theoretically, the group randomised to mild hypothermia
should have enjoyed the cerebroprotective effects of mild intra-ischaemic
hypothermia intraoperatively, especially during the ischaemic challenge of
temporary clipping. It was subsequently speculated that possibly not all
IHAST patients had experienced a significant intraoperative ischaemic
challenge and in turn a subgroup analysis of those 441 patients who
indeed required temporary clipping was performed [25]. Among these
patients, the duration of focal ischaemia - that is, temporary clipping - was
the most important determinant of outcome, with those patients requiring
temporary clipping of >20 minutes faring significantly worse. Even in this
selected subpopulation, mild intra-ischaemic hypothermia did not
significantly alter neurologic outcome after intraoperative focal ischaemia.
The IHAST results raise the question of how to document relevant
intraoperative focal ischaemic challenges and the beneficial effects of
neuroprotective interventions in future studies. Even after SAH, gentle
surgical manipulation and brief temporary clipping in expert hands were
apparently not adequate ischaemic challenges to resemble animal models
of temporary focal cerebral ischaemia and reperfusion.

Introduction: Brian Kellock quotes in his book The Fibreman the seven￾year-old (that is, in the year 1918) Denis Burkitt discussing respectfully his
uncle Dr Roland Burkitt’s legendary reputation amongst his patients in
Kenya, Africa, as: ‘... he believed in curing fevers, in particular in delirious
patients, by artificially lowering the patients’ temperature ...’ [1].
Obviously, Dr Roland Burkitt, the uncle of the legendary Prof. Dr Denis
Burkitt, after whom the African lymphoma and its association with Epstein￾Barr virus was named, had realized that lowering the body temperature in
patients with high fevers, in Kenya highly likely to being due to cerebral
malaria, meningitis or encephalitis, might influence positively the course of
such potentially - at this time, in many instances, definitely - life￾threatening disease [1]. Zdravev stipulated that otogenous brain abscesses
not only need to be surgically evacuated but, when causing cerebral
herniation, may benefit from lowering body temperature. He was the first
to conclude that high body temperature in patients with increased
intracranial pressure may be a deleterious association [2].
The wide variety of mechanisms of injury that are exaggerated by
hyperthermia and may be ameliorated by moderate hypothermia are
described elsewhere in this supplement (see abstract A1). They include
mechanisms of neuroexcitotoxicity [3], release of free radicals, changes in
blood-brain barrier and vascular permeability, the release of
proinflammatory mediators, drawing leucocytes across the blood-brain
barrier, increasing the number of inflammatory cells in the brain tissue and
the passage of neutrophils, phagocytes, monocytes and macrophages into
the brain, additionally injuring neuronal cells by stimulating further
immune reactions [4]. Whether interfering with these mechanisms by
moderate hypothermia may reduce secondary insult onto neuronal cells
and brain tissue is still a matter of discussion. What has been known for
long time is that increased intracranial pressure, as frequently seen in viral
encephalitis, severe bacterial meningitis and/or brain abscesses, may be
modified by therapeutic hypothermia/targeted temperature management
[5]. In addition, long-term morbidity and mortality in CNS infection may
additionally deteriorate if bacterial meningitis is complicated by cerebral
infarction, occurring during the course of disease [6]. Thus, preventing
cerebral infarction may be an important tool in reducing both morbidity
and mortality in adults with community-acquired bacterial meningitis.
Prandini and colleagues have shown that mild hypothermia reduces
remarkably polymorphonuclear leucocyte infiltration in induced brain
inflammation in rats compared with those without hypothermia [4].
After any type of brain injury, in particular, ischemic and ischemia
reperfusion injury, the reduced brain oxygen supply quickly leads to a
decrease in ATP and phosphocreatine levels, thus initiating a complex
cascade of events involving excessive calcium influx into brain cells,
excessive glutamate receptor activation and neuronal hyperexcitability;
that is, triggering off the excitotoxic cascade [3]. Exactly this excitotoxic
cascade may be responsible for provoking overt or subtle epileptic
seizures in patients with CNS infection, thereby deteriorating the prognosis
of these patients. Irazuzta and colleagues could nicely show that in rabbits
hypothermia decreases excitatory neurotransmitter release in bacterial
meningitis, in particular, the release of glutamate and aspartate, known to
be involved in the pathogenesis of neuronal injury in meningitis,
suggesting that hypothermia may attenuate excess neuronal stress in this
disease [3].
Febrile refractory status epilepticus may be caused by presumed
encephalitis carrying a very high morbidity and mortality rate [7]. In
addition, it is believed that hyperthermia aggravates brain damage due to
continuing epileptic activity. In a retrospective analysis Nakagawa and
colleagues found a significant improvement of outcome in children with
such febrile refractory status epilepticus who were treated by therapeutic
hypothermia with subsequent prophylactic normothermia compared with
those children with the same disease but treated only by conventional
therapy without fever management [7]. The authors conclude that
treatment with therapeutic hypothermia plus subsequent prophylactic
normothermia may reduce neurological damage in such patients with
severe acute encephalopathy due to refractory febrile convulsive status
epilepticus. Another Japanese group treated an adult patient with
influenza type A virus-associated encephalopathy with routine therapeutics
as oseltamivir and methylprednisolone pulse therapy. Because of severe
brain swelling, hypothermia was added. This combination treatment led to
full recovery without neurologic sequelae [8]. A similar observation has
been reported in 43 children with acute inflammatory encephalopathy
and/or encephalitis, out of whom 27 were treated with mild hypothermia.
These 27 children were compared with 16 similar patients who were cared
for at normothermia levels [9]. The effect of therapeutic hypothermia for
children with acute encephalopathy/encephalitis was observed to be
dependent on the timing when cooling was initiated. Early cooling (within
12 hours of initial neurological signs of encephalopathy/encephalitis)
improved outcome whereas delayed cooling (after 12 hours) tended to be
even deleterious [9].
In adults, therapeutic hypothermia in CNS infection has been limited to
single case reports and case series. Cuthbertson and colleagues reported
induced hypothermia, together with barbiturate coma, in a meningitis
patient associated with intractable raised intracranial pressure. Throughout
the entire period of mild hypothermia (35°C), achieved by thiopental and
external cooling, cerebral perfusion pressure was maintained above
70 mmHg. Barbiturate-induced coma and induced hypothermia were
continued for 48 hours when complications (pancreatitis, ventilator￾associated pneumonia) prompted one to stop these two therapy modalities.
However, the patient remained without any ICP rebound, eventually being
weaned from the ventilator and making a rather uneventful recovery, being
discharged home with reportedly no neurologic deficits 3 weeks after the
disease had began [5]. Similarly, a case with space occupying herpes

simplex virus encephalitis has been reported by Wagner and colleagues. The
authors correctly state that conventional intracranial pressure-lowering
modalities are limited in such severe herpes simplex virus encephalitis
patients and more aggressive treatment options are needed. They induced
moderate hypothermia (33°C), resulting in fast and sustained control of
intracranial pressure. Eventually the patient regained a relatively good
functional outcome, being able to walk unassisted (GOS 4). It needs to be
noted that rewarming was done very slowly (1°C/day); that is, over a period
of 4 days [10].
Very recently two larger cases series have been published on the use of
therapeutic hypothermia both in adult viral meningoencephalitis and in
adult community-acquired meningitis by the same Croatian group:
Therapeutic hypothermia in adult viral meningoencephalitis [11]:
Eleven adult patients with viral or presumed viral encephalitis (two TBE, two
HSV, one VZV, six unknown) pathogen were treated with mild hypothermia,
rectal temperature aimed to be 32 to 34°C. The authors, however, do not
elaborate on rewarming, speed of rewarming and any adverse effects of
rewarming. Remarkably only one patient (1/11 = 9%) died, 3/11 recovered
fully, 2/11 with only minor impairment and 5/11 with moderate to severe
residual neurological deficit. All patients showed severely impaired GCS at
admission (median GCS 8 (range 3 to 10)) and median Acute Physiology and
Chronic Health Evaluation score (APACHE) being 24 (range 12 to 32).
A major drawback of this study is the lack of ICP monitoring, sonographic
measurement of optic nerve sheath diameter having been used as
surrogate markers for ICP, both methods not being as reliable as continuous
ICP and CPP monitoring. The mortality rate of 9% in this case series
compared with 29% in patients with viral meningoencephalitis treated in
their unit before implementation of the therapeutic hypothermia protocol.
The authors suggest that in carefully selected patients, carefully regarding
vasoreactivity status, and, of course, only in those with initially reduced
cerebral perfusion pressure, therapeutic hypothermia may be a tool to
reduce long-term morbidity and mortality.
Therapeutic hypothermia in bacterial meningitis [12]: The same
Croatian group presented a series of 10 patients with severe bacterial
meningitis (nine patients: pneumococci, one patient: Escherichia coli) with
an initial median GCS of 6 (range 3 to 9), APACHE II ranging from 22 to
34 (median 31). They employed the same protocol of non-invasive ICP
monitoring (using transcranial Doppler sonography, optic nerve sheath
diameter sonography and jugular bulb oximetry). Hypothermia was
induced by intravenous infusion of cold isotonic saline and maintained
with continuous venovenous hemofiltration at 32 to 34°C. Nothing is said
about rewarming, rewarming speed and duration of hypothermia. Two
patients died within 48 hours from admission because of refractory
intracranial hypertension, two more patients with severe residual
neurological deficits (GOS 2) died later on, after discharge from the ICU,
because of late-onset nosocomial sepsis; in total, a rather high mortality
rate [13,14]. The surviving six patients had a mean ICU stay of 22 days
(range 8 to 36), two had a severe and two a moderate residual
neurologic deficit. Two of the entire group of 10 patients with bacterial
meningitis had a complete neurological recovery (GOS 5).
The authors discuss hypothermia as a neuroprotective measure in severe
bacterial meningitis. In nine (out of 10) patients pneumococci were isolated
as the causative organisms; however, the authors do not elaborate whether
these patients - qualifying early for dexamethasone treatment, in particular,
since they showed severe clinical signs and symptoms of increased
intracranial pressure - had been given dexamethasone or not. They discuss
that corticosteroids have not substantially changed disease outcomes
among patients with most severe pneumococcal meningitis. Exactly this
aspect is in contrast to the widely accepted knowledge and level of
evidence respectively. Recently a meta-analysis has clearly shown that
European patients with pneumococcal bacterial meningitis (aged >55 years)
definitely benefit from the adjunctive application of dexamethasone [15].
Only one single patient would not have qualified for this definition (47-year￾old female being severely immunocompromised). This might explain the
high mortality rate despite the administration of the adjunctive therapy with
moderate hypothermia. The authors correctly claim that any adjunctive
therapy should be continued beyond the very first hours and days since it
has been known that in severe bacterial meningitis vasculopathy leading to
ischemic stroke may ensue even days after onset. Adequate maintenance of
sufficient cerebral perfusion pressure until recovery of CO2 reactivity (not to
be expected before day 4 after initiation of antibiotic treatment) is essential
and requires therapeutic hypothermia to be maintained for this period
of time. However, the results of this pilot trial in 10 consecutive patients do
not justify one to recommend therapeutic hypothermia as adjunctive
therapy in bacterial (pneumococcal) meningitis. Whether selected patients
with either intractable ICP, dangerously low CPP or infection-associated
refractory status epilepticus benefit from moderate hypothermia needs to
be elucidated; today this is still a case to case decision.

Background: Therapeutic hypothermia (TH) is a very elegant way of
inducing short-term and long-term neuroprotection in various disease
entities. It has become the standard of care after cardiac resuscitation
with an impressive outcome improvement in prospective randomised
trials. However, by a broader use of this sophisticated measure the critical
care community has become aware of potential side effects limiting its
effect on patient outcome. Among others, an increased rate of infections
is observed under therapeutic hypothermia and controlled normothermia.
The pathophysiological considerations by which TH increases infectious
complications comprise reduced inflammatory response and suppression
of leukocyte migration and phagocytosis. All together, these observations
justify a high vigilance towards infectious manifestations if temperature
modulation measures, namely therapeutic hypothermia and controlled
normothermia, are used in critical care patients.

Pathophysiological considerations about hypothermia and infections:
Intriguing data derived from animal models showing a potent neur￾oprotective effect in various disease entities induced by hypothermia gave
way to a broader use of this method in humans. Thus, therapeutic
hypothermia has become the standard of care after cardiac resuscitation as
studies demonstrated its strong neuroprotective effect and neurologic
outcome improvement [1,2]. It is now recommended by the European
Resuscitation Council and the International Liaison Committee on
Resuscitation in cases of comatose adults with spontaneous circulation
after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) [3]. However, in indications other
than resuscitation, such promising results could not be achieved in
prospective trials shifting the scientific focus on possible side effects of TH
[4-6]. Rewarming injury, shivering, electrolyte dysbalance, pharmacological
and pharmacodynamic alterations, cardiovascular effects including
arrhythmia, insulin resistance and infections have recently been attributed
as limitations occurring in a dose-dependent fashion under TH [7]. Taken
together, maximal reduction of these side effects should be a treatment
goal if dealing with temperature control measures irrespective of the target
temperature. Today, infectious complications are thought to be one of
the major contributors limiting the effects of hypothermia [7-12]. Thus
advancing diagnostic approach, prevention and treatment of these
infectious complications is a great concern of the scientific critical care
community and need to be addressed in future prospective trials. In
various studies enrolling patient populations suffering from such different
diseases as traumatic brain injury, ischaemic stroke or resuscitation post
cardiac arrest, an increased rate of infections under TH was observed
[4,6,11]. Whether this negative effect has to be attributed to a specific
cooling measure remains under debate; however, this hypothesis is
unlikely as increased infections are found under both endovascular and
surface cooling measures.
The biological interpretation of the pathophysiological backgrounds is
challenging as temperature modulation inhibits various inflammatory
responses on different levels that are only partly understood today [7,8].
Hypothermia impairs the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and
suppresses leukocyte migration and phagocytosis [7,8]. Recently it has
been speculated that hypothermia may induce insulin resistance leading
to hyperglycaemia possibly promoting infection onset [8,13].
However, increased rate of infections has also been observed not only
under TH but also under endovascularly controlled prophylactic
normothermia in patients with severe cerebrovascular disease [10,14].
A significant increase of infectious complications was observed in the
endovascular treatment group although TH was strictly avoided.
Importantly in this study from our group, analysis of the inflammatory
parameters revealed a significant increase of C-reactive protein (CRP) in
the prophylactic normothermia group whereas procalcitonin (PCT) and
white blood cell count were not elevated [10]. This is a crucial point as it
might indicate that temperature modulation may influence the prognostic
value of inflammatory parameters [10].
In a retrospective review by Mongardon and coworkers including 421
patients being treated after cardiac arrest, in 281 patients (67%) an
infectious complication was diagnosed [11]. Pneumonia was the most
frequent, followed by bloodstream infections and catheter-related infections
[11]. Gram-negative bacteria were the most frequently isolated infectious
germs, but the main pathogen detected was Staphylococcus aureus [11]. The
high rate of reported pneumonia raises the question of whether intubation
at an early stage should be considered in patients under TH to minimise the
risk of aspiration.
Is this surcharge too much and how can we minimise it in clinical
routine?: Hospital-acquired infections lead to secondary injury in
patients and are responsible for a considerable cost increase especially
in critical care patients [15,16]. An increased rate of infections under
controlled normothermia and therapeutic hypothermia has been
described in patients suffering from ischaemic stroke, traumatic brain
injury, spontaneous subarachnoid haemorrhage, post resuscitation and
intracerebral haemorrhage [6,9,10]. If this observation is associated with
significantly impaired outcome or even mortality is under debate
[6,9-11]. However, there is general consensus that infections lead to
prolonged ICU treatment, secondary injury and lastly to cost increase
with significant global economic burden [15]. Therefore, the critical care
community has to find effective strategies to minimise the risk of
infection complications.
Temperature modulation by any means has to be combined with a
standard operation procedure including: routine microbiological
surveillance including blood, urine, respiratory specimen work-up;
radiological pneumonia surveillance; daily monitoring of inflammatory
parameters (CRP, PCT, leukocytes); routine check of catheter insertion
sites and timely catheter replacement; avoidance of hyperglycaemia
(under TH) and hypoglycaemia (while rewarming!); and monitor
performance of cooling device as a high cooling power/rate might
indicate fever even if the body core temperature is normal or even <36°C.
Conclusion: These observations justify a high level of vigilance towards
infectious manifestations if temperature modulation measures, namely
therapeutic hypothermia and controlled normothermia, are used in
critical care patients. Whether, at all, the early use of antibiotics in case of
suspected infections under TH is justified has to be addressed in future
prospective trials.

Introduction: The effects of hypothermia on coagulation may represent a
two-edged sword in patients with acute brain injury who are treated with

therapeutic cooling. On the one hand inhibition of coagulation can have
positive effects, such as improvements in the microcirculation and
inhibition of the formation of harmful microthrombi in the brain [1]. On
the other hand this could lead to increased bleeding risk and thereby
cause harm to patients, especially if they have suffered traumatic injuries
or are actively bleeding for other reasons. This manuscript will briefly
discuss what is known about the effects of hypothermia on cooling.
In vitro and experimental data: The effects of hypothermia on
coagulation have been studied mostly in vitro. Very mild hypothermia
(down to 35°C) has no effect on any part of the coagulation cascade.
Temperatures below 35°C can in some cases (but not in all patients, see
below) induce mild platelet dysfunction and sometimes a mild decrease
in platelet count. When temperatures drop below 33°C other steps in the
coagulation cascade, such as the synthesis and kinetics of clotting
enzymes and plasminogen activator inhibitors, can also be affected [2-8].
Recently, Ruzicka and coworkers performed a study in which they
precisely measured thromboelastography in healthy subjects at a
temperature range starting at 38°C all the way down to 12°C [9]. They
reported that decreasing temperatures led to a progressive delay in the
initiation of thrombus formation, as well as a decrease in the speed of
clot creation and growth. However, significant effects of hypothermia on
this parameter began only at 30°C, progressing rapidly below this
temperature but reaching statistical significance only at 24°C [9]. These
authors also found that once clot formation had been completed, the
stability of the clot could no longer be influenced by hypothermia; that
is, the clots once formed remained stable regardless of temperature. Of
note, there was significant interindividual variability in the response of
the coagulation parameters to cooling [9].
Hanke and coworkers [10,11] reported that the anticoagulatory effects of
hypothermia were markedly increased if acidosis was present, that the
effects of hypothermia could be effectively reversed by administering
DDAVP and fibrinogen, but that these drugs worked well only if acidosis
was corrected [10].
Finally, a number of animal studies have looked at the effects of
hypothermia on hematoma formation in models for intracranial
hemorrhage and subdural hematoma [12-16]. These studies have not
found any evidence for increased hematoma growth or bleeding risk
associated with mild hypothermia; in fact, the opposite effect (decreased
hematoma volume and vascular brain edema) was observed in most of
these studies [12-16]. Indeed a randomized clinical trial is currently being
organized to test the safety and efficacy of cooling in patients with
intracranial hemorrhage [17].
Clinical studies: The clinical effects of mild hypothermia on bleeding
appear to be minor, and clinical studies suggest that the risk of severe
bleeding associated with mild hypothermia is very low or even absent.
None of the large studies in cardiac arrest, stroke, or traumatic brain
injury have reported significant increase in bleeding risks associated with
therapeutic cooling, although it should be emphasized that actively
bleeding patients were excluded from these studies [12].
Preliminary data suggest that hypothermia can even be used safely in
combination with thrombolytic therapy. Hemmen and colleagues
performed a prospective controlled clinical trial in 58 patients with acute
ischemic stroke, 28 of whom were treated with hypothermia (33°C)
combined with thrombolytic therapy [18]; they found that the risk of
hemorrhagic conversion did not increase in patients treated with both
hypothermia and TPA compared to those treated with TPA alone, and in
fact the risk of symptomatic ICH trended to be lower in cooled patients
[18].
Spiel and colleagues studied the effect of hypothermia induced by cold
fluid infusion in cardiac arrest patients; they reported only slightly
prolonged clotting time as measured by rotation thrombelastography
[19].
Storm and coworkers compared risk and severity of bleeding in cardiac
arrest patients treated with mild hypothermia and thrombolysis to
matched historical patients treated with thrombolysis only [20]. They
found that the incidence of bleeding was not increased by hypothermia,
although there was a trend towards more red blood cell units being
required to reach target hematocrit in hypothermic patients who did
develop bleeding complications. As neurological outcomes were
significantly better in patients treated with both thrombolytics and
hypothermia, even in those who developed bleeding complications, the
authors concluded that bleeding risks should not be viewed as a reason
to withhold hypothermia treatment [20].
Tuma and colleagues performed a retrospective analysis from a trauma
registry database and identified patients who had developed cardiac arrest
and had been treated with hypothermia [21]. The number of patients was
small but they found no increased complication rate from hypothermia, in
particular bleeding, in their patients. This is noteworthy as hypothermia
has gained a negative reputation among those treating multi-traumatized
patients, and is seen as one of the factors in the ‘lethal triad’ of shock,
acidosis and hypothermia [22]. The discrepancy may be explained by the
interplay between acidosis and hypothermia, as explained above; the
effects of (deep) hypothermia on coagulation are pronounced, and difficult
to reverse, mainly if there is simultaneous acidosis [22]. However, in the
absence of acidosis the effects of hypothermia are much less pronounced,
and far more easily controllable and reversible. Most patients undergoing
elective treatment with mild hypothermia will not have severe acidosis,
and therefore effects of hypothermia on coagulation will be minimal.
These clinical data and the physiological effects of cooling should be taken
into account when decisions are made on whether or not to use
hypothermia in patients who are actively bleeding, or who are at high risk
for bleeding. If possible the (potential) source of bleeding should be
(surgically) controlled before cooling is initiated. If this is not possible the
risks of bleeding should be weighed against the benefits of cooling, and
careful consideration should be given to the depth of hypothermia
induced in that patient. Because very mild hypothermia (35°C) does not
affect coagulation in any patient this temperature can be safely induced
even in patients with very high bleeding risk. At temperatures below 35°C
some patients may begin to have mild platelet dysfunction (although in
most patients this will occur only at lower temperatures). These effects will
be significantly magnified in the presence of acidosis.
In my hospital patients who are admitted after cardiac arrest will usually
be cooled to 32 or 33°C for a period of 24 hours, followed by slow
rewarming over 16 to 24 hours. If such a patient has concomitant severe
traumatic injury (for example, blunt abdominal trauma) and/or has
injuries that pose a high bleeding risk that cannot easily be surgically
controlled (for example, liver laceration), this patient typically would be
cooled to 35°C, and cooling would be continued for 48 or 72 hours
instead of our current standard of 24 hours. Similarly, if a patient
develops severe uncontrollable bleeding during hypothermia therapy (for
example, major upper GI bleed with hemodynamic instability) we would
consider rewarming this patient to 35°C (or maintaining 33°C and giving
platelet transfusion). In mildly elevated bleeding risk we will cool the
patient to 33°C and will treat with platelet transfusion and DDAVP if
bleeding complications occur (unless there are severe counter-indications
such as recent stent placement).
Of note, it is unknown whether decreasing the intensity of cooling while
extending the duration of therapy will provide similar benefits as applying
treatment according to published guidelines [23]. Therefore, of course
those not at high bleeding risk should be cooled to between 32 and 34°C
as current guidelines recommend [23].
Conclusion: Although mild to moderate hypothermia has some effect on
the coagulation system the clinical risk of bleeding associated with cooling
appears to be very low. This will, however, increase significantly if the
patient has moderate-to-severe acidosis. No effects of hypothermia on
coagulation occur in any patient as long as temperature is ≥35°C, and
patients at very high bleeding risk can safely be cooled to this temperature.

Hypothermia in cardiogenic shock

Cardiogenic shock is a state of inadequate systemic tissue perfusion,
despite adequate left ventricular filling pressure. It is caused by extensive
myocardial damage and appears to be aggravated by a systemic
inflammatory response [1-4]. The result is hypotension with metabolic
acidosis and often a fatal outcome. The condition affects approximately
5% of the patients with myocardial infarction, and carries a dismal
prognosis if it prevails after reperfusion.
Therapeutic hypothermia has several properties of potential benefit in
cardiogenic shock: Experiments with isolated myofibrils, papillary muscles
and cross-circulated hearts have demonstrated that mild hypothermia
increases myocardial contractility [5-7]. In the in vivo heart, mild hypothermia
has been found to increase stroke volume and cardiac output [6,8].
The increase in contractility is considered to be mediated by an increased
myofilament sensitivity to existing Ca2+, without a corresponding increase in
myocardial oxygen consumption [9]. Moreover, hypothermia reduces the
metabolic rate with 5 to 7%/°C [10,11], thereby reducing the demand on the
circulation from the peripheral tissues. In an experimental setting, it also has
the ability to reduce infarct size if applied prior to reperfusion [12,13].
In dog-based and porcine-based models of cardiogenic shock secondary to
ischemia, therapeutic hypothermia has improved hemodynamic and
metabolic parameters, and reduced mortality [14,15]. No randomized
controlled trials of therapeutic hypothermia in cardiogenic shock in humans
exist, but case series indicate that the effects observed in animal
experiments can be reproduced [16-19].
In conclusion, therapeutic hypothermia is a promising treatment option
for patients in cardiogenic shock that warrants further investigation.

Reperfusion injury in acute myocardial infarction

Technology, Dresden, Germany

Background: For many years it has been shown that the size of a
myocardial infarction is not only determined by ischemic damage, but also
by reperfusion itself. This reperfusion injury contributes to up to 50% of the
final infarct size. Mechanical postconditioning using short periods of
ischemia immediately after reperfusion, pharmacologic postconditioning
targeted to prevent opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition
pore, and hypothermia have been shown to prevent reperfusion injury in
animals and to reduce infarct size in smaller studies. Larger studies targeted
to reduce heart failure and mortality are eagerly awaited.
Introduction: Since the early 1970s, infarct size has been identified as a
major predictor of prognosis after myocardial infarction: infarct size parallels
with arrhythmia, heart failure, and mortality [1]. Apart from this finding,
infarct size is not only determined by the area at risk; that is, the
myocardium perfused by the infarct-related artery. In a seminal work,
Reimer and coworkers could show that irreversible myocardial injury, as
determined by cardiac myocyte necrosis, progresses as a wavefront from
the subendocardium towards the subepicardium [2]. This observation led to
the concept that early reperfusion therapy can salvage myocardium at risk
from injury. Early reperfusion therapy within the first 3 to 6 hours after the
onset of ischemia was, in consequence, rapidly introduced into clinical
routine and is now standard treatment of patients with acute myocardial
infarction.
In parallel, it was recognized that reperfusion of temporarily nonperfused
myocardium itself has effects on cellular integrity [2]. Reperfusion saves
viable myocytes. However, it accelerates the disruption of irreversibly injured
myocytes, and thereby permits the process of inflammation, phagocytosis,
and infarct repair to begin quickly. It leads to interstitial hemorrhage from
vessels that are injured by ischemia but are reperfusable at the time of
reflow; that is, in the border zone of the infarction. The hemorrhage itself
increases the interstitial pressure, which in consequence worsens the tissue
perfusion again. Moreover, reperfusion induces severe morphologic
alterations of the myocardium such as cardiac myocytes swelling,
mitochondrial damage, hypercontracture, and loss of myofibrillar
organization [3]. The observation that reperfusion itself influences infarct
size has led to the concept of lethal reperfusion injury [2,3]. It became
quickly clear that reperfusion injury is not only determined by mechanical
factors such as hemorrhage or interstitial pressure. Reperfusion leads to the
activation of many signaling pathways that contribute independently to
both apoptotic and necrotic tissue injury and thus decrease the amount of
viable myocardium (reviewed in [4,5]). The concept of additional myocardial
damage is induced by lethal reperfusion injury has been supported by the
observation that interventions started before reperfusion can reduce infarct
size, as discussed below [4,5]. Studies in animals suggest that lethal
reperfusion injury accounts to up to 50% of the final size of a myocardial
infarction.
Clinically, reperfusion injury may be seen in four different types of cardiac
dysfunction: myocardial stunning - that is persistent mechanical dysfunction
despite restored blood flow which is usually reversible within weeks; the no￾reflow phenomenon after opening of an infarcted coronary artery;
reperfusion arrhythmia; and lethal, irreversible injury of the myocardium. In
the recent years, rapid revascularization was instituted to prevent
reperfusion injury. From a clinical view, currently there seems to be no
potential to further reduce infarct size by faster restoration of blood flow.
Therefore other than mechanical strategies to reduce reperfusion injury and
in consequence infarct size are highly welcome to improve the outcome of
the patients. To further understand potential strategies, the molecular
mechanisms contributing to reperfusion injury are of importance.
Signals contributing to reperfusion injury: The signals contributing to
reperfusion injury have been recently reviewed in detail [5]. Major
contributors are as follows.
Oxidative stress [6]: which is discussed as the oxygen paradox since
the reoxygenation of ischemia generates a myocardial injury that
exceeds the injury of ischemia alone. Oxidative stress diminishes the
cardioprotective effects of nitric oxide, leading to more neutrophil
activation, increased levels of superoxide radicals, and diminished
myocardial blood flow.
Increased intracellular calcium: occurring secondary to the ischemic
damage of the sarcolemmal membranes and to the oxidative stress-induced
dysfunction of the sarcoplasmic reticulum [7]. The calcium excess induces
cardiac myocytes death by hypercontracture and opening of the
mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), a molecule recently
identified as one of the most important targets in reperfusion injury [8].
The rapid restoration of physiologic pH during reperfusion: which
follows the washout of lactic acid. This leads to the activation of the
sodium-hydrogen exchanger, finally leading to mPTP opening [9].
Inflammation: leading to neutrophil accumulation and their transmigration
into the myocardial tissue. These neutrophils cause vascular plugging and
release degradative enzymes and reactive oxygen species [10].
In addition to these more traditional factors, the reperfusion injury salvage
kinase (RISK) pathway and its effector, the mPTP, have been currently
postulated to be centrally involved in reperfusion injury [8,11,12]. Opening
of the mPTP, which releases calcium from the mitochondria and leads to
intracellular calcium overload, does not occur in ischemia but is a key
determinant of the first few minutes of myocardial reperfusion. Some
authors discuss that this pathway could serve as the final effector of the
above discussed contributors to reperfusion injury.
Treatment in humans: Whereas in animal studies many agents were
successful to reduce reperfusion injury, the translation of these results into
the clinical setting has been disappointing for many years [5]. Several
groups tried to target oxidative stress with antioxidants or nitric oxide
supplementation. These trials had negative results [5,13,14]. Comparably,
trials of inhibition of the sodium-hydrogen exchanger, which have been
successful in animals by reducing the intracellular calcium overload in
reperfusion and by delaying pH normalization in the reperfused
myocardium, failed in humans [15], as have various measures to reduce the
inflammatory damage induced by neutrophils [5]. Trials with metabolic
modulation such as glucose-insulin-potassium infusions or magnesium
therapy had inconclusive results. Together, these measures addressing the
traditionally seen contributors to reperfusion injury were, at least in humans,
not successful to clearly reduce myocardial damage.
Some attempts have clinically been done to treat the no-reflow
phenomenon. The administration of platelet glycoprotein GP IIb/IIIa blockers
or thrombus aspiration improves reflow after vessel reopening, with limited
influence of infarct size. Adenosine is widely used to treat slow-flow
phenomena in the infarct-related artery. Of note, the administration of
adenosine as an anti-inflammatory and vasodilatatory agent during
reperfusion could reduce infarct size in humans, making adenosine currently
the only clinically used drug which improves both reflow and infarct size.
Adenosine, however, did not reduce clinical end points, which was the
primary end point of this study [16].
Three strategies are currently discussed as innovative treatment
modalities for reperfusion injury in acute myocardial infarction:
mechanical postconditioning, pharmacological postconditioning with

substances influencing the RISK pathway and the mPTP, and
hypothermia.
Mechanical postconditioning: In 2003, Zhao and coworkers could
demonstrate that short periods of ischemia and reperfusion applied
immediately after reopening of an infarct-related artery could reduce
reperfusion injury and infarct size, a concept referred to as ischemic
postconditioning [17]. In animal studies, ischemic postconditioning involves
all major contributors to reperfusion injury including the RISK pathway and
the mPTP. Various smaller clinical studies showed in humans that repetitive
inflations of an angioplasty balloon after reopening of the infarct-related
artery reduces infarct size, wall-motion scores and comparable end points
[18-20]. A related strategy, which has also shown to be effective in animals
and humans, is the remote ischemic postconditioning. Here, transient
episodes of ischemia and reperfusion in a remote organ - that is, skeletal
muscle - protect the heart from reperfusion injury. A very elegant
randomized trial could show that the simple, non-invasive, repetitive
inflation of a standard blood pressure cuff in patients with acute myocardial
infarction reduces infarct size when applied before the reopening of the
infarct-related artery [21]. Given the confirmation of this finding in larger
trials, mechanical, remote postconditioning could be an easy and safe
measure to reduce reperfusion injury.
Pharmacologic postconditioning: Extensive preclinical evidence showed
that pharmacologic activation of the RISK pathway or prevention of mPTP
opening reduces reperfusion injury. Some drugs addressing the RISK
pathway have been tested in proof-of-concept studies in patients. Of those,
inhibition of the protein kinase C-isoform delta with the substance KAI-9803
given into the infarct-related area immediately before reperfusion [22] and
administration of high-dose atorvastatin before PCI [23] are the most
promising, both showing favorable effects in about 150 randomized
patients. Another clinical trial addressed directly the mPTP. In a small pilot
trial including 58 patients, the i.v. administration of cyclosporine (2.5 mg/kg),
known to inhibit mPTP opening, reduced infarct size and the release of
cardiac markers [24]. Due to the limited numbers of patients, however, it is
not clear whether those interventions result in the reduction of clinical
endpoints.
Hypothermia: For a couple of years, it has been known that in animals
hypothermia instituted before the reopening of an infarct-related coronary
artery reduces reperfusion injury and thus infarct size [25]. For infarct size
reduction, hypothermia has to be instituted before reperfusion [26],
whereas cooling directly after vessel reopening is unsuccessful in most
cases [26]. It is discussed that hypothermia prevents the reactive
hyperemia in early reperfusion.
Few studies examined the effects of hypothermia in patients with acute
myocardial infarction. Dixon and colleagues could show that therapeutic
hypothermia is safe in myocardial infarction patients, however, without
influencing outcomes [27]. Wolfrum and colleagues showed in patients
with myocardial infarction subjected to CPR that institution of therapeutic
hypothermia before revascularization did not prolong door-to-balloon
times [28]. Two yet unpublished studies, the COOL-MI study and the ICE-IT
study, showed no effect on infarct size in the total population. However, in
patients with anterior myocardial infarction cooled to <35°C at the time of
reperfusion, infarct sizes were roughly halved [29]. The treatment of awake
patients not subject to CPR is, however, limited due to counter-regulatory
processes such as shivering, which leads to increased oxygen demand and
workload of the heart. Future studies will test hypothermia in patients with
myocardial infarction, using a straightforward adjunctive treatment with
buspirone and meperidine to prevent shivering. In this setting, clear
treatment protocols are necessary to avoid prolongation of the door-to￾balloon time in patients with myocardial infarction.
Problems still to face: Signaling: Some conditions have been identified
to inhibit salvage from reperfusion damage like myocardial hypertrophy,
diabetes, age, and hypercholesterolemia (reviewed in [30]). All these
conditions are associated with limited ability to successfully activate the
RISK pathway. Either they increase the threshold of mechanical
postconditioning or they abolish myocardial salvage at all. As these
conditions are highly present in the patient population, further research
may be of relevance to reestablish susceptibility to modified reperfusion
strategies.
Timing: All proposed strategies to prevent reperfusion damage assume a
relevant amount of reperfusable myocardium that is waiting to be
salvaged. All planned measures to reduce reperfusion damage before
revascularization should preferably be applied in a very short time.
Infarct size: Hard clinical endpoints can only be met when there is a
significant clinical benefit to be achieved. Posterior infarcts or smaller
infarcts of the anterior region only affecting small or medium-sized
vessels do not go along with high mortality and therefore there are not
many lives to be saved by an optimal reperfusion strategy.
Conclusion: Reperfusion injury contributes to up to 50% of the total
myocardial damage. In spite of many successful results in animals, the
translation into the clinical setting has been disappointing for many years.
Recently, mechanical, remote ischemic postconditioning as well as
pharmacologic postconditioning with substances addressing the RISK
pathway and the mPTP have shown positive effects on surrogate end points
in patients. Hypothermia may be another option in the treatment of
reperfusion injury. Larger studies exploring the potential of these
therapeutic options to influence clinically relevant endpoints are eagerly
awaited. Currently, the evidence is insufficient to permit a widespread
clinical use of those interventions.

Intracranial pressure and hypothermia

Although the neuroprotective potential of hypothermia is well known and
has been established experimentally, its clinical use is limited to selected
indications [1], as large trials have yielded disappointing results [2]. This has
been mainly attributed to the side effects of hypothermia in critically ill
patients and problems with rewarming.
Intracranial hypertension is a major problem in neurocritical care and
particularly in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and traumatic
brain injury (TBI), causing death if uncontrolled. As trials on prophylactic
hypothermia, for example, for TBI have not been successful in improving
outcome, its routine use can currently not be recommended. However,
there are many literature reports demonstrating enormous efficacy of
hypothermia to reduce elevated intracranial pressure (ICP). Mechanisms of
action are thought to be the reduction of metabolism and perfusion and the
reduction of edema besides others. Studies have indicated that therapeutic
efficacy is sufficient for ICP control at mild hypothermia of 35°C, thus
minimizing detrimental effects. In desperate clinical situations hypothermia
is used to control intracranial hypertension both for TBI and SAH, but it has
recently been applied only as a last resort. Other second-tier therapies
and surgical maneuvers like decompressive craniectomy have been
popularized instead, although their efficacy is still questioned as well. The
knowledge and experience with therapeutic hypothermia has advanced in
recent years and the problems of side effects and most importantly
rewarming can be better addressed [3]. The latter has been a tremendous
problem in patients with uncontrollable ICP, as despite its initial efficacy ICP
problems recurred, if hypothermia was stopped prematurely. This goes in
line with a recent metaanalysis that stressed the importance of prolonged
hypothermia (48 hours to 5 days) and of slow rewarming (<1°C/4 hours).
As a consequence the Eurotherm3235Trial was initiated to investigate
the effect of hypothermia particularly for intracranial pressure reduction [4].
It has to be awaited whether this will foster the use of hypothermia to treat
elevated ICP or whether we will stick with the policy of controlled
normothermia.

Standard operating procedures both for scientific study protocols as well
as in routine daily practice stress the importance of slow rewarming after
targeted temperature management/moderate therapeutic hypothermia
(32 to 34°C) [1-3]. The recommended rewarming speed ranges from 0.1 to
0.4°C/hour, the former allowing a minimum of 24 hours to reach
normothermia levels whereas in case of the latter the normothermic
temperature levels are reached within 6 to 8 hours. It has been well known
and it is widely accepted that abrupt temperature changes, with
insufficient temperature control methods, cause change in energy
expenditure and intracranial pressure and a negative effect onto the
cerebral perfusion pressure and cerebral blood flow. In avalanche survivors
the so-called afterdrop has been described to be an additional potentially
dangerous condition [4,5]; hypercapnia has been shown to increase the
core temperature cooling rate in snow burial victims; furthermore,
shivering influences both cooling and rewarming and the cooling
afterdrop [4,5].
In the rat model the speed of rewarming plays a crucial role in the
development of acute lung injury in intestinal ischemia treated with
therapeutic hypothermia. Reactive oxygen species have been shown to
play an important role in the pathogenesis of various injuries, including
brain injury and lung injury [6]. Besides this, inflammatory reaction and
nitric oxide levels are clearly influenced both by therapeutic hypothermia
and speed of rewarming. It might be surmised that more gradual
rewarming and the addition of anti-inflammatory drugs during this period
of rewarming [7,8] might add to or even enhance the neuroprotective
effect of therapeutic hypothermia/targeted temperature management
[9,10]. This assumption is underlined by the findings that biogenic amines
that have been demonstrated to protect cells from apoptotic cell death
(for example, serotonin and dopamine) protect cells against rewarming￾induced active oxygen species formation and apoptosis [11]. Thus, it is
correctly hypothesized that adding drugs containing these biogenic
amines or releasing endogenously serotonin and dopamine might help to
prevent potential negative side effects of rewarming [11].

Most of the knowledge of post-hypothermic rewarming effects has been
gained in experimental settings [1,12,13]. More than 10 years ago the
neuroprotective effect visualized by amyloid precursor protein positive
axonal swellings, quantifying them per unit area and, thus, serving as
marker of both pathophysiologic and neuroprotective effect respectively,
has been shown to be reversed completely when normothermia was
achieved very rapidly within 20 minutes [3,14]. The originally documented
axonal protection was not only eliminated by this rapid rewarming but, in
fact, the overall burden of axonal damage was dramatically increased,
reaching a virtual doubling of the numbers of damaged axons seen per
unit area [3]. Not only amyloid precursor protein accumulation but also
neurofilament compaction was seen to be exacerbated by rapid
rewarming [3].
Besides this and other neuropathological effects there is now clear
evidence that cerebral microcirculation, both in traumatic brain injury and
in other severe intracranial diseases, is structurally and functionally
perturbed and that this perturbation can be attenuated by hypothermia
followed by slow rewarming [2,15]. Similar to the situation with axonal
injury, discussed above, the hypothermic protection against cerebral
microcirculation impairment can be reversed or the injury even
exacerbated by rapid post-hypothermic rewarming [2]. In addition,
compelling evidence has been found that traumatically induced or
hypoxia-induced generation of oxygen radicals significantly contributes to
secondary insult onto brain cells but also damaging endothelium and
smooth muscle cells [13]. When employing hypothermic intervention
followed by slow rewarming, significant vascular protection was provided;
in particular, the generation of oxygen radicals was reduced [14]. The
protective effect of hypothermia, once again, is not only a function of time
of initiating target temperature and overall duration of hypothermia. Even
more importantly, all these positive effects are reversed by rapid
rewarming enhancing vascular dysfunction following neuronal injury [10].
Povlishock and Wei clearly state that in the context of traumatically
induced axonal damage, microvascular dysfunction, and cerebral
contusion, any potentially beneficial effect of hypothermic intervention is
consistently reversed and the lesion even exacerbated when post￾traumatic hypothermia is followed by rapid rewarming [2]. Most likely,
both direct and indirect mitochondrial perturbation together with
processes mediated by free radicals influence the ensuing biology and
pathophysiology. Post-hypothermic rewarming rates and the potential
adverse consequences of rapid rewarming are closely observed in the field
of transplantation medicine wherein hypothermic organ maintenance and
rewarming are integral to successful organ viability and subsequent
transplantation. Rapid rewarming is highly damaging in case of liver
transplantation, most likely due to rapid ATP depletion, energy failure and
oxygen radical production associated with hepatic mitochondrial damage.
Extrapolation from this body of experimental and human medical
knowledge clearly indicates/allows the statement that any type of
targeted temperature management/therapeutic hypothermia needs to be
followed both by very slow rewarming on the one hand and
maintenance of normothermia after reaching the normothermia level on
the other hand [16-19]. Exactly this aspect of slow/very slow rewarming
has been partially neglected in most recently published studies [19,20]; in
particular, on therapeutic hypothermia in traumatic brain injury [21]. In
view of the ongoing pathophysiologic processes leading to secondary
neuronal damage over a period of more than 5 days post trauma, not
only that the duration of therapeutic hypothermia but also the speed of
rewarming (0.4°C/hour) need to be questioned and might be interpreted
as the major cause of the negative study outcome.
Every researcher, when compiling a study protocol, as well as every clinician
is strongly advised to accept the impact of duration of hypothermia and
speed/rate of rewarming as being crucial elements both in research and
clinical practice. Although it might correctly be surmised that the duration of
therapeutic hypothermia is associated with the incidence and intensity of
complications, the same might hold true for too short a duration and too
quick a rewarming rate. Further studies are needed to evaluate various
durations (1 day vs. 3 or 5 days, vs. even longer) both in traumatic brain
injury but also in other neurologic diseases that trigger off secondary
pathophysiological processes such as ischemic stroke (concept of
penumbra), spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (peri-hematoma edema),
traumatic brain injury or spontaneous aneurysmatic subarachnoid
hemorrhage with pathophysiologic processes going on for days and even
weeks after the acute ictus. In view of these considerations, prolonging
therapeutic hypothermia and, in particular, slowing the rate of rewarming
might be the crucial clue to achieve the best possible benefit from targeted
temperature management/moderate therapeutic hypothermia without
counteracting these benefits by too speedy a rewarming rate. In addition,
maintaining normothermia after hypothermia and rewarming seems to be
essential in order to avoid the negative rebound effects [22,23].
Finally, it needs again to be noted that a too rapid rewarming might lead to
vasodilatation, thus aggravating intracranial pressure, reducing cerebral
perfusion pressure and leading to a negative effect on overall neurological
outcome [1,19].

Introduction: Rewarming is a delicate phase of therapeutic hypothermia
(TH). Adverse consequences of rewarming on the whole body may
seriously limit the protective effects of hypothermia, leading to secondary
injury. Thus, understanding, predicting, and managing possible systemic
side effects of rewarming is important for guaranteeing TH efficacy. The
aim of this brief report is to describe rewarming effects from a systemic
perspective.
Hemodynamics and imbalance in oxygen consumption and delivery:
TH linearly decreases the metabolic rate of homeothermic organisms.
During the cooling process, tissue oxygen consumption (VO2) slows by
roughly 6%/°C reduction in body temperature [1,2], obeying the van’t
Hoff-Arrhenius law, which states that the rate of a biochemical reaction is
halved for each 10°C decrease in temperature. The reduction in brain
metabolism is similar [3].
In contrast, during rewarming, the possible appearance of a mismatch
between total body oxygen demand and oxygen delivery (DO2) [4] has been
recognized since the pioneer works of Hegnauer and colleagues on dogs [5]
and Bigelow on humans [6]. Bigelow has described this side effect of
rewarming as rewarming shock: ‘This syndrome of acute acidosis, or
rewarming shock, was characterized by a progressive decline in blood pH
[...] associated with respiratory inadequacy [...]. A fall in blood pressure and
tachycardia were features in some cases’. In more recent studies, rewarming
shock after moderate TH seems to be a more infrequent eventuality,
probably because TH management has been completely changed by the
advent of ICUs and a far less hypothermic regimen. The mismatch between
oxygen supply and consumption during rewarming could depend on
numerous factors, including metabolic rate, abnormalities in oxygen
extraction, cardiac output (CO), circulating blood volume, regional blood
flow, pH, blood viscosity, and a shift in the hemoglobin dissociation curve.
The physiopathology of this side effect of rewarming is not known.
Rewarming from hypothermia is such a complex and metabolism-pervasive
process to alter all of the possible determinants of a VO2/DO2 mismatch. Of
the possible determinants of VO2/DO2, cardiac dysfunction has been the
most investigated. Cooling determines a proportional decrease in cardiac
output [1], heart rate, and mean arterial blood pressure, with no change in
stroke volume and increased peripheral vascular resistance. During the
maintenance stage of TH, the decrease in metabolic rate is equal to or
greater than the decrease in cardiac output, and alteration of oxygen
delivery is not a matter of concern. Preliminary clinical studies [7] and a
recent meta-analysis [8] have shown a decrease in myocardial ischemic
injury. Many of the alterations in the cardiovascular system occurring during
hypothermia completely reverse during rewarming. Therefore, the
rewarming phase could lead to a permanent deterioration of myocardial
function and cardiac output. The pathophysiological mechanism underlying
cardiac dysfunction induced by hypothermia rewarming has been studied
by Tveita’s group, first in vitro using a rat left ventricular papillary muscle [9]
and then in vivo [10] in an intact rat model. These studies showed how post￾rewarming systolic left ventricular dysfunction can be related to decreased
myofibrillar Ca2+ sensitivity due to increased troponin C phosphorylation.
In addition, Blair and colleagues [11] and Morray and Pavlin [12] documented
an increase in total oxygen consumption to values above prehypothermic
controls in a dog model of rewarming after deep hypothermia. The authors
suggested many possible explanations for this event. First, heterogeneous
blood flow distribution [13] during hypothermia may determine areas of
oxygen debt, with decreased or absent perfusion, that become hypoxic and
generate lactate. During rewarming, these areas are reperfused and lactate
re-enters normal oxidative pathways, consuming oxygen in the process.
Second, with a return to normothermia, free radical oxidation [14,15] and
inflammatory response to injury [16,17] could resume, leading to
nonrespiratory utilization of oxygen and an increase of VO2 over pre-injury
control. Third, shivering can occur during rewarming as a response to
deviations from the temperature set point. The shivering response to
maintain a constant core temperature is a concerted reaction involving
skeletal muscle contraction and peripheral vasoconstriction. When shivering
occurs during rewarming, it is associated with increased VO2 [18,19] and
hemodynamic instability [20].
Cain and Bradley 21] and Schumacker and colleagues [22] have described
abnormalities of peripheral oxygen extraction in dogs during hypothermia,
even with adequate oxygen delivery. An alteration in the temperature
transition of oxidative phosphorylation has been documented in an animal
model. Leducq and colleagues presented evidence for an abnormal
pattern of oxidative phosphorylation control that correlated with a
transition in mitochondrial permeability and persisted after rewarming
[23]. This phenomenon may cause alterations in oxygen utilization during
and after rewarming.
Kondratiev and colleagues addressed the problem of oxygen supply in a
rat model of deep hypothermia (15°C) and rewarming [24]. The experiment
demonstrated a reduction in cardiac output and oxygen delivery after
prolonged deep hypothermia (15°C for 5 hours) compared with less
prolonged exposure. The rewarming-related rightward shift of the oxygen
hemoglobin saturation curve, which facilitates oxygen dissociation at the
tissue level, compensated for compromised peripheral oxygen transport,
leading to a stable oxygen supply. Knowing the events causing VO2/DO2
mismatch during rewarming is important in this phase of TH for
monitoring and assuring adequate cerebral and whole body oxygen
delivery. Low oxygen delivery accounts for the development of secondary
injury, which limits the safety and effectiveness of TH. With this
perspective in mind, we can suggest various measures to limit VO2/DO2
mismatch during rewarming.
First, rewarming after TH should be done slowly and in a controlled
manner [25]. Eshel, in a rat model of TH, showed how rapid rewarming
from moderate hypothermia is associated with more acute hemodynamic
alterations compared with slow rewarming [25]. Similar effects were
described in humans [26] and pediatric patients [27] undergoing TH for
hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy and deep intraoperative hypothermia
(27°C), respectively, as well as in the work of Hanhela and colleagues [28]
on adults undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass for cardiac surgery.
Second, controlling pain, sedation, and preventing shivering should limit
oxygen consumption. Michenfelder and colleagues [29], Rodriguez and
colleagues [30], and Zwischenberger and colleagues [31] demonstrated that
the suppression of shivering by neuromuscular blockade is an effective
method for diminishing VO2. More recently, Badjata and colleagues [32]
proposed a simple shivering grading tool, the Bedside Shivering Assessment
Scale (BSAS), developed by assessing the correlation of bedside shivering
and systemic metabolic stress quantified by indirect calorimetry. Using
clinical observation of muscle involvement, the BSAS provides an accurate
representation of shivering-related oxygen consumption. Accurately defining
shivering intensity assures the possibility of a stepwise treatment for
shivering. We recommend initially managing shivering with nonsedating
interventions, such as correcting hypomagnesemia, or a serotonin (5-TH) 1A
partial agonist like buspirone or meperidine. Meperidine has been
demonstrated to effectively reduce VO2 augmentation associated with
postoperative shivering at a dosage that does not cause respiratory
depression [33]. When these first line interventions fail, sedation with short￾acting sedative agents and neuromuscular blockade can be used.
Third, oxygen content and transport should be optimized. Anemia and
arterial desaturation must be avoided during rewarming. To date, no
clinical trials have examined hemodynamic optimization in patients that
have undergone TH, least of all during rewarming, and no evidence is
currently available to indicate the best strategy for hemodynamic support
in such a critical phase. We suggest a strict control of hemodynamics, with
the aim of guaranteeing adequate oxygen delivery and avoiding VO2/DO2
mismatch, using at least continuous arterial pressure monitoring, volume
balance and urine output surveillance, and frequent serum lactate

measurements. In the case of hemodynamic instability, advanced
monitoring capable of finer management could be useful. Thus, in this
context, echocardiography and goal-directed hemodynamic optimization
[34] may have a place. Treatment of systolic left ventricular impairment
presents additional concerns. Pharmacological therapy with catechola￾mines presents substantial limitations [35,36], as the decreased
myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity during rewarming significantly diminishes b￾adrenoceptor effects. In addition, catecholamines determine elevated
myocardial oxygen consumption and arrhythmogenesis. A recent study by
Rungatscher and colleagues [37] tested the efficacy of levosimendan in
improving myocardial dysfunction after rewarming from deep hypo￾thermia in a rat model. Levosimendan, as a Ca2+ sensitizer, demonstrated
better inotropic and lusitropic effects than epinephrine.
Glycemic homeostasis: Animal models have shown that hypothermia
induces alterations in blood glucose homeostasis via several mechanisms:
reduced glucose utilization [38], decreased endogenous insulin secretion
[39-41], and increased resistance to exogenous insulin [42,43]. In a recently
published prospective observational study dealing with glycemic
homeostasis during TH after cardiac arrest (CA), Cueni-Villoz and colleagues
found a significantly higher mean blood glucose concentration, blood
glucose variability, and insulin dose during TH compared with the
normothermia that follows passive rewarming [44]. Because the doses of
adrenergic agents did not change significantly between the two steps, the
authors advocated lower endogenous insulin levels and the development of
insulin resistance as an explanation for the findings. The improvement in
glycemic control observed during normothermia, despite lower insulin
infusion, suggests that progressive recovery towards normal glycemic
homeostasis occurred during rewarming. The rate of hypoglycemic episodes
correlated with poor neurological outcome and was similar during TH (8%)
and normothermia (7.5%), but more frequently in patients who presented
with higher blood glucose variability during TH. These data highlight the
importance of progressive tapering of insulin doses to avoid hypoglycemia
during passive rewarming from TH after CA, especially for patients who
exhibited abrupt glucose shifts during TH.
The importance of glycemic control is further outlined in a recent work by
Smith and colleagues. The alteration of blood glucose homeostasis is
associated with increased ICU morbidity and poor outcome [45]. Passive
rewarming from TH increases insulin sensitivity, but active rewarming from
cardiopulmonary bypass decreases it. In both settings, rewarming is
characterized by a dynamic insulin/glucose ratio; glucose should be checked
frequently and insulin requirements promptly adapted to achieve optimal
glycemic control.
Electrolytes: Mild hypothermia shifts potassium inside the cells and
predisposes the patient to hypokalemia, as well as hypocalcemia,
hypomagnesemia, and hypophosphatemia. During rewarming, rebound
increases in these electrolytes (particularly potassium) may occur,
especially if they were replaced excessively during the cooling period [46].
Hyperkalemia can be prevented by slow and controlled rewarming,
allowing the kidney to excrete the excess potassium. In patients with
severe oliguria or anuria, renal replacement therapy should be started
before rewarming to avoid hyperkalemia.
Systemic inflammation: TH has been shown to suppress ischemia-induced
cerebral and systemic inflammation after traumatic brain injury (TBI) in
preclinical [47-51] and clinical settings [16]. Following CA and reperfusion,
TH is the only effective therapy for increasing survival and decreasing
morbidity [52], probably by impairing harmful inflammatory reactions, which
characterize systemic ischemia-reperfusion syndrome [53]. In a recent study,
Bisschops and colleagues measured the kinetics of inflammatory mediators
during TH and rewarming after CA [16]. Proinflammatory IL-6 increased
during the TH phase, but values were surprisingly lower after rewarming.
Anti-inflammatory IL-10 and IL-1RA did not significantly change over time.
Complement and adhesion molecules, an index of endothelial activation,
were elevated at admission, fell to low values during TH, and increased
again after rewarming, confirming the hypothesis that inflammatory
processes reactivate with the increase in temperature [17]. Interestingly, no
significant differences were found between artery and jugular samples,
confirming that the ischemia-reperfusion phenomenon is not confined to
the brain, but affects the whole organism.
Fast rewarming rates have been shown to predict worse outcomes in
animal models [49,54,55] due to the rapid reactivation of the inflammatory
processes that were set-off by TH. Even if experimental evidence shows
the advantages of controlled rewarming, additional clinical studies are
needed to determine the optimal rewarming rate and strategy. Several
drugs have also been tested recently in cell culture, tissue, and animal
models to check their ability to mitigate the detrimental effects of
rewarming. Data from Schmitt and colleagues suggest that pretreatment
with methylprednisolone increases cerebral cell survival after deep
hypothermia [50], but also suppresses important neuroprotective and
regenerative processes induced by the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6.
Diestel and colleagues focused on endothelial cells [56], which maintain
systemic inflammation via cytokine production. Only combined
pretreatment with methylprednisolone and tacrolimus inhibited IL-6
secretion. A specific p38 inhibitor was demonstrated to downregulate the
unwanted release of IL-6 after cooling and rewarming most effectively. In a
rat model of intestinal ischemia, gradual rewarming and administration of
dexamethasone improved [48] survival and attenuated ALI after intestinal
ischemia/reperfusion injury treated with TH in rats. Alva and colleagues
[15] found that metabolic acidosis induced by rewarming was prevented
by fructose 1,6-biphosphate (F1,6BP) administration in rats. F1,6BP also
protected against oxidative stress induced after rewarming by decreasing
lipid peroxidation in the plasma and potentiating antioxidant enzyme
activities in erythrocytes. These results may be due to an increase in
plasma nitric oxide and leukocytosis after the F1,6BP bolus. Other
preclinical studies dealing with the anti-inflammatory safety and efficacy of
these drugs are needed before a clinical study can start.
Infections: The most described infectious complication during TH is
pneumonia. As most of the pneumonia diagnoses are made during
rewarming or after achieving normothermia [57,58], several authors have
claimed that rewarming itself should be considered a high risk for
infection. However, as the studies cited above adopted TH for 24 hours
and achieved normothermia in the following 12 to 24 hours, the
occurrence of pneumonia diagnosis during or after rewarming could also
be due to latency from inoculation to the clinical manifestation of
infection. Moreover, as hypothermia causes an impaired inflammatory
response, clinical signs of infection leading to the diagnosis may be fully
detectable only after reactivation of the immune system during or after
rewarming. Whether more gradual controlled rewarming can reduce the
frequency of pneumonia is unclear. In a small case series [59], even very
slow controlled rewarming (0.1°C/hour) was associated with a high
frequency of pulmonary infection, perhaps because slow rewarming
prolongs the total duration of hypothermia.
Coagulation: Mild platelet dysfunction occurs at temperatures <35°C,
and some inhibition of the coagulation cascade develops at temperatures
<33°C. In TH after TBI [58] and stroke [57], the platelet count can also
decrease, which persists during and after rewarming. In neonatal cold
injury, death occurring during rewarming has been attributed to massive
thrombosis from platelet hyperaggregation [60].
All of these data suggest that, in the clinical setting, attention must be
paid to rewarming rates and attaining the target temperature to assure
the optimal effects of hypothermia. The rewarming rate is an important
variable; slower rewarming rates should be routinely employed to avoid
systemic side effects.

Hypothermia in refractory status epilepticus
Andrea O Rossetti
Service de Neurologie, CHUV-BH07, Lausanne, Switzerland
Critical Care 2012, 16(Suppl 2):A26
Introduction: Status epilepticus (SE) is a neurological emergency with
potentially important mortality and morbidity. After refractoriness to general
anesthetics, several pharmacological and nonpharmacological options have
been described more or less anecdotally. In this context, and despite animal
data supporting neuroprotective actions of brain hypothermia and showing
its efficacy in SE models, hypothermia targeting a core temperature of about
33°C for at least 24 hours together with pharmacological sedation has been
scarcely reported in adults and children. It seems that this approach rarely
allows a sustained control of SE, as seizures tend to recur in normothermic
conditions. Conversely, hypothermia has a high evidence level and is
increasingly used in postanoxic encephalopathy, both in newborns and
adults. Due to the thin available clinical evidence, prospective studies are
needed to define the value of hypothermia in SE.
Refractory status epilepticus and its treatment: SE represents the
second most frequent neurological emergency after acute stroke, and bears
significant risks of morbidity and mortality [1]. SE persisting despite
adequate doses of benzodiazepines and at least one antiepileptic drug
(AED) is considered refractory (RSE) [2,3]; this develops in 23 to 43% of
patients with SE. RSE is associated with acute, severe and potentially fatal
underlying etiologies, such as encephalitis, large stroke, or rapidly
progressive primary brain tumors, and may be accompanied by coma; these
factors, together with increasing age, represent the most important
outcome predictors [1].
After securing pulmonary and cardiac functions, intravenous administration
of a sequence of three groups of drugs represents the mainstay of
management [4]: benzodiazepines (the only clearly evidence-based step);
classical antiepileptic drugs (AED, mostly phenytoin, valproate, or
levetiracetam); and general anaesthetics for RSE. Among anaesthetics,
midazolam, propofol, or barbiturates represents the most popular agents,
without any hard evidence favoring one specific compound [1]. Anesthetic
treatment may lead to various complications (infections, metabolic
disturbances, ileus, neuropathy, myopathy, thromboembolic events) [5]; it is
therefore necessary to balance these risks with the benefit of rapid seizure
control. Generalized convulsive RSE should be treated rapidly with general
anesthetics, given the danger of systemic and neurological injury with
ongoing convulsions; conversely, nonconvulsive SE without marked
consciousness impairment can be approached more conservatively, as these
forms are probably not associated with the same risk of injury [1,2,6].
RSE that proves refractory to a first course of general anesthetics implies a
(repeated) careful search of the underlying etiology. This condition may be
managed in several ways, which mostly rely on small series or case reports
[1,7]. Briefly, pharmacological options may include further use of anesthetics
(the three aforementioned, ketamine, isofluorane), other AED (for example,
topiramate, lacosamide), or ketogenic diet. Reported nonpharmacological
approaches span from resective surgery, through vagus-nerve,
electroconvulsive or transcranial magnetic stimulations, to mild therapeutic
hypothermia (TH).
While the benefits of hypothermia on patients with head injury were
already described by Hippocrates [8], TH enjoys an only evidence-based
status in the setting of adult and pediatric postanoxic encephalopathy,
and reduction of intracranial pressure [9]. Its indication for the treatment
of other acute brain disorders, including SE and traumatic brain injury, is
essentially anecdotic.
Animal data on hypothermia: Low brain temperature exerts beneficial
effects on the cascades involved in acute cerebral injuries; several seminal
studies have been recently reviewed [9,10]. Hypothermia reduces brain
metabolism and ATP consumption, and leads to decrease of glutamate
release, free radicals, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and calcium
overload. Conversely, brain-derived neurotrophic factor increases; as a result,
apoptosis is inhibited. Furthermore, hypothermia reduces reperfusion injury,
permeability of the blood-brain barrier, and inflammatory reactions. Of note,
most of these mechanisms are involved in the pathophysiology of SE
leading to neuronal injury [11]. Various rodent models of SE support the
neuroprotective effects of TH, showing (with concomitant benzodiazepines)
a reduction of seizure severity in SE triggered by electrical stimulation of
limbic structures [12], and mitigation of seizures, brain edema, and cognitive
deficits in kainate-induced SE [13]. Temperature lowering before pilocarpine
injections (a proconvulsant) protects against SE and apopotosis [14].
However, TH has received very little attention in clinical settings.
Experience in patients with refractory status epilepticus: More than two
decades ago, three children with generalized SE were successfully treated
with TH (30 to 31°C) and thiopental [15]. Four adults with SE triggered by
limbic encephalitis (two patients), hepatic encephalopathy (one patient)
and of unknown origin (one patient) were treated with TH (31 to 35°C) co￾administered with midazolam; SE was controlled in all, but two patients
later died [16]. Shivering was managed by neuromuscular blockade; vein
thrombosis and pulmonary embolism were the reported side effects.
Another adult with cryptogenic SE was treated with TH (34°C) and
thiopental, but she developed paralytic ileus requiring emergency intestinal
resection; she survived after further treatment of her RSE [5]. Ongoing
seizures in an infant with a severe developmental disorder were controlled
by TH at 35 to 36°C, together with ketamine; subsequently, hemisphere￾ctomy had to be carried out [17]. Finally, an abstract in Japanese describes
an improved functional outcome in 12 children treated with TH (34 to
36°C) and general anesthesia for febrile SE, as compared with 16 treated
with conventional therapy, in a retrospective assessment [18]. Reported TH
durations are variable, between 20 hours and several days. These case
studies suggest that hypothermia may contribute to seizure control.
However, its efficacy seems to be only transient: seizures tend to recur in
normothermia. TH may thus represent an option in severely refractory SE,
but rather to gain some time as to definitively control seizures.
Recently, it has been recognized that postanoxic SE, even with early
myoclonus, does not imply an invariably dismal outcome. It seems that SE
occurring during TH, mostly as a seizure suppression EEG pattern, does
reflect an extremely severe brain damage, and patients are extremely
unlikely to survive [19,20]; conversely, SE arising after return of normothermia
and in presence of a reactive EEG background, and preservation of brainstem
reflexes and early cortical somatosensory evoked potentials, may be
successfully treated with the usual therapeutic armamentarium; those cases
represent at most 10% of patients with postanoxic SE, and a good functional
outcome can be reached [21]. This actually suggests that TH (with moderate
midazolam or propofol doses) can be sufficient to transitorily control benign
postanoxic SE (corroborating its antiepileptic properties), while it does not
prevent a poor outcome in more severe forms.
Conclusion: As there is a lack of clinical evidence, mild TH (32 to 36°C) may
represent a therapeutic option for RSE, albeit on a patient by patient basis.
Barbiturates should be avoided because of the risk of paralytic ileus (thus
favoring midazolam or propofol), and mild hypothermia should be
administered for 24 to 48 hours. Repeated controls of cardiovascular indices,
coagulation parameters and lactate (metabolic acidosis following severe
infections or intestinal necrosis), and clinical surveillance (vein thrombosis)
are mandatory. A well-designed, prospective trial appears necessary to
assess the exact role of TH in SE.

Therapeutic hypothermia (TH) improves short-term neurologic outcome
and reduces mortality after cardiac arrest (CA) [1]. Neuroprotective
mechanisms comprise reduced cerebral metabolic demand [2,3],
decreased excitotoxicity [4-7], cell membrane stabilization [8,9], inhibition
of spreading depolarizations [10] and cytokine release [11], and
preservation of cerebral autoregulation. This concept of neuroprotection
led to clinical trials using TH for the prevention of secondary brain injury in
patients with traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and
ischemic stroke; however, they failed to show any benefit in clinical
outcomes [12-15]. This may reflect our lack of understanding of the exact
pathophysiologic processes induced by TH and the potential harm
through hypothermia and rewarming injury [16].
Advanced neuromonitoring techniques allow online measurement of brain
metabolism, cerebral autoregulation, brain tissue oxygenation, and
cerebral blood flow (CBF) and provide information about brain function,
energy supply and demand [17-19]. Here we will summarize current
knowledge about the effects of TH on brain homeostasis after acute brain
injury using advanced neuromonitoring techniques and call for more
observational trials investigating pathophysiologic mechanisms during TH
and rewarming to maximize the benefits of this emerging therapeutic
modality.
TH effectively decreases intracranial pressure (ICP) by up to 10 mmHg
[12,20-22], whereby mild hypothermia (35°C) seems to be as effective as
33°C [21,23]. Mechanisms include the reduction in metabolic demand and
the inhibitory effect on inflammation and free radical production
stabilizing the blood-brain barrier and decreasing vasogenic edema
[20,24-26].
Cerebral microdialysis allows bedside monitoring of cerebral metabolic
changes from the extracellular fluid of the brain [27]. Decreased energy
supply, increased demand or mitochondrial dysfunction may result in brain
metabolic distress and/or brain hypoglycemia (brain glucose <0.7 mmol/l).
Cerebral microdialysis is feasible during TH and sensitive to detect
secondary energy failure as indicated by an increase in the lactate￾pyruvate ratio (LPR) [28,29]. Therapeutic hypothermia reduces brain
metabolic demand for oxygen and glucose and preserves ATP supply to
the brain decreasing the risk of secondary energy failure [29-32]. Moreover,
extensive cerebral lactate accumulation is inhibited by TH, which
ameliorates the deleterious effects on cell membranes and the blood-brain
barrier [33]. Increased brain glucose may be found during TH [6]; however,
an increased blood glucose variability during hypothermia has been
reported [34]. This may negatively affect brain glucose as sudden
decreases in systemic glucose have been associated with brain metabolic
distress and worse outcome [35]. Therefore monitoring of brain glucose is
important to detect brain hypoglycemia and prevent further neuronal
damage during TH and the rewarming phase. An additional beneficial
effect of hypothermia that has been extensively studied in vitro and in
animal models is the reduction in excitotoxic neurotransmitter release
[4-7,28], thereby inhibiting nitric oxide synthesis and apoptotic pathways
[16,36]. A decrease of extracellular glutamate was observed during TH after
cardiac arrest and in ischemic stroke patients using cerebral microdialysis
[28,37]. In summary, cerebral microdialysis allows monitoring of the
metabolic effects of TH after acute brain injury.
Another mechanism how TH may reduce secondary energy failure is a
decrease in oxygen consumption through diminished metabolism [2,3],
resulting in increased brain tissue oxygenation [25,38]. Brain tissue
oxygenation reflects the net effect of oxygen delivery, diffusion and
consumption and can be assessed by positron emission tomography,
magnetic resonance spectroscopy, near-infrared spectroscopy or by invasive
PbtO2 probes [39,40]. Therapeutic hypothermia below 35°C may impair brain
tissue oxygenation through a left-shift of the oxygen dissociation curve,
therefore enhancing the affinity of oxygen to hemoglobin, or by decreasing
delivery of oxygen to the brain [21,41]. Jugular bulb oxygen saturation
(jSvO2) is a global measurement of brain oxygen extraction and is increased
during mild TH [31,41], reflecting a reduction in cerebral metabolic rate of
oxygen.
Shivering is frequently observed during TH and may abolish the
neuroprotective effect of temperature modulation through increase in
metabolic demand and systemic and cerebral energy consumption [42].
A shivering-associated reduction in PbtO2 seems to correlate with the
intensity of therapeutic cooling and potentially increases the risk of brain
hypoxia [43]. These results imply that the neuroprotective effect of TH
may be most beneficial at a temperature not lower than 35°C and
shivering should be assessed at the bedside and effectively treated by
pharmacological and nonpharmacological means [42].
It is important to note that CO2 reactivity may be preserved during TH [44].
Therapeutic hyperventilation as TH is used as rescue therapy to decrease
raised ICP and unintentional hypocapnia is also commonly observed in
patients with acute brain injury [45], which increases the risk of brain tissue
hypoxia [38]. Monitoring of brain tissue oxygen or jugular venous oxygen
saturation (jSvO2) is recommended for patients with acute traumatic brain
injury, where therapeutic hyperventilation is used [46] and is important
especially during TH. Preserved cerebral autoregulation seems not to be
disturbed during TH and early induction of hypothermia after SAH led to
faster restoration of cerebrovascular reactivity in vivo [6,47,48].
The rewarming has been considered as the vulnerable phase following TH
[42,49,50]. Rapid rewarming and timing in vulnerable phases of the injured
brain may abolish the neuroprotective effects of TH through ICP increase,
excitotoxicity, increased metabolic demand and derangement of
cerebrovascular reactivity [42,51-53]. A report of four patients treated with
TH after CA observed an increase in LPR in all patients during rewarming

indicating brain ischemia [28]. Slow and controlled rewarming after
moderate hypothermia may prevent ICP increase and glutamate release
and stabilize infarct volume [53]. Close monitoring of cerebral metabolism,
ICP, CBF and brain tissue oxygenation can help to define the optimal
rewarming rate to avoid increases in ICP (recommended rate of 0.1°C) and
to early detect an imbalance in energy supply and demand.
Conclusion: In the clinical setting there is still need to further explore the
best induction and maintenance method, optimal duration and targeted
temperature of therapeutic hypothermia. Due to the complexity of
pathophysiologic mechanisms during hypothermia and rewarming,
combining different advanced monitoring techniques seems mandatory.
Multimodal neuromonitoring guidance may then help to define
therapeutic targets and to establish clinical protocols to maximize the
benefits of this emerging therapeutic modality.

Hypothermia and nutrition: at present more questions than answers?

Therapeutic hypothermia (TH) has been recently accepted as a powerful
medical intervention for providing neuroprotection to patients sustaining
cardiac arrest and hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. Further, TH has also
been explored as a potential treatment strategy for patients with traumatic
brain injury and ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke (for review see [1]). With
the widespread propagation of TH as treatment for intracranial hypertension
in patients who are refractory to standard interventions [2], induction and
maintenance of TH is no longer restricted to the early period (that is, the
first 12 to 24 hours) of acute brain injuries but has expanded over several
days until rewarming [3]. Therefore, it is evident that, in addition to the
disease process itself, TH has a major impact on ICU management such as
analgesia and sedation, ventilator therapy, cardiocirculatory support, or
artificial nutrition.
Importantly, the significance of nutrition therapy in critically ill patients
cannot be overstated [4]. Critical illness typically induces a catabolic stress
state proportional to the severity of injury, predisposing patients to
serious nutritional deficits coupled with multiple organ dysfunction,
delayed recovery and disproportionate mortality [5]. Effective nutrition
therapy can play a major role in attenuating the catabolic response and
avoiding the harmful effects of prolonged hypermetabolism. International
guidelines provide recommendations for timing until initiation of artificial
nutrition, administration route, energy targets and type of nutrients in
critically ill patients [4,6]. Starting early nutrition within 24 to 48 hours,
primarily using the enteral route, is a proactive strategy to reduce energy
deficit [7]. Importantly, underfeeding and overfeeding must be avoided,
which implies monitoring nutritional delivery to timely identify an
increasing energy gap or excess administration [8]. Energy requirements
are most accurately assessed by measuring resting energy expenditure
using indirect calorimetry; however, this method is not widely available
[9]. Instead, guideline targets could be applied, with a cautious initial
energy requirement of 20 to 25 kcal/kg/day increasing thereafter in the
recovery phase. Enteral nutrition has the advantage of preventing
adverse structural and functional alterations of the gut barrier and of
improving mesenteric blood flow as well as enhancing local and systemic
immune responsiveness [10]. On the other hand, critically ill patients may
often have intolerance to gastric feeding [11]. Prokinetic medications may
help restore gastric emptying and promote gastrointestinal motility [12].
Persistent intolerance to enteral nutrition selects patients who will require
supplemental parenteral nutrition [6]. Another issue in the context of
metabolic consequences of nutrition therapy that deserves attention is
glycemic control. Both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia are of particular
concern in critically ill patients [13]. However, to date the goal for blood
glucose level and whether intensive or a moderate insulin therapy should
be employed in these patients, especially with acute brain injuries, is still
uncertain [14]. Implementation of a protocol to promote control of serum
glucose when providing nutrition therapy is advocated, and a range of
110 to 150 mg/dl (6.1 to 8.3 mmol/l) may be most appropriate [4].
Whether the aforementioned recommendations on artificial nutrition of
the general intensive care patient population can also be applied on equal
terms to patients undergoing TH is still a matter of debate. Studies
addressing the various issues of nutrition therapy in TH are scarce, as
evidenced by a contemporary PubMed search including bibliographies of
published reviews. So far, data are available on the course of energy
expenditure in patients treated with TH suffering from ischemic or
hemorrhagic stroke [15,16] and severe traumatic brain injury [2]. In
sedated, ventilated patients receiving muscle relaxants a significant
decrease in resting energy expenditure ranging at approximately 75 to
85% of baseline values during TH could be demonstrated. Downregulation
of cerebral and overall metabolism as well as muscle relaxation has been
discussed as major factors of the reduction in energy expenditure [15]. In
contrast, shivering, an anticipated consequence and potentially major
adverse effect of TH, has been shown to be strongly associated with
graded increases in systemic metabolism [16]. This clearly indicates the
need for an individualized determination of the optimal amount of energy
to be delivered during TH. Further, one has to bear in mind that other
(patho)physiological changes might occur in patients treated with TH.
During the maintenance period of TH, electrolyte replacement is often
needed because of a decrease in serum levels of potassium, magnesium
and phosphate. With rewarming, these electrolytes are released from
intracellular stores and move to extracellular spaces. Therefore, care must
be taken to avoid rebound hyperkalemia [17]. In addition, insulin
resistance, which can lead to hyperglycemia, may occur during TH. Again,
in the rewarming period insulin sensitivity may increase rapidly, resulting
in sometimes marked hypoglycemia if the insulin dose is not adjusted
appropriately [17].
In conclusion, many questions regarding the nutrition therapy of patients
treated with TH remain to be answered. Further studies that focus on the
optimal amount of caloric intake, timing, preferred route of administration
and monitoring of nutrition delivery during targeted temperature
management are urgently needed.
