Abstract
Background: In the assessment of severity in community acquired
pneumonia (CAP), the modified British Thoracic Society (mBTS)
rule identifies patients with severe pneumonia but not patients who
might be suitable for home management. A multicentre study was
conducted to derive and validate a practical severity assessment
model for stratifying adults hospitalised with CAP into different
management groups.
Methods: Data from three prospective studies of CAP conducted in
the UK, New Zealand, and the Netherlands were combined. A
derivation cohort comprising 80% of the data was used to develop
the model. Prognostic variables were identified using multiple
logistic regression with 30 day mortality as the outcome measure.
The final model was tested against the validation cohort.
Results: 1068 patients were studied (mean age 64 years, 51.5%
male, 30 day mortality 9%). Age ⩾65 years (OR 3.5, 95% CI 1.6 to
8.0) and albumin <30 g/dl (OR 4.7, 95% CI 2.5 to 8.7) were
independently associated with mortality over and above the mBTS


rule (OR 5.2, 95% CI 2.7 to 10). A six point score, one point for
each of Confusion, Urea >7 mmol/l, Respiratory rate ⩾30/min, low
systolic(<90 mm Hg) or diastolic (⩽60 mm Hg) Blood pressure),
age ⩾65 years (CURB-65 score) based on information available at
initial hospital assessment, enabled patients to be stratified
according to increasing risk of mortality: score 0, 0.7%; score 1,
3.2%; score 2, 3%; score 3, 17%; score 4, 41.5% and score 5, 57%.
The validation cohort confirmed a similar pattern.
Conclusions: A simple six point score based on confusion, urea,
respiratory rate, blood pressure, and age can be used to stratify
patients with CAP into different management groups.
