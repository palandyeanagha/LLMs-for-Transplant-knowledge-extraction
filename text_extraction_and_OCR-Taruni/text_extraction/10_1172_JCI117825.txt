Abstract
Type III cGMP-inhibited phosphodiesterases (PDE3s) play
important roles in hormonal regulation of lipolysis, platelet
aggregation, myocardial contractility, and smooth muscle
relaxation. We have recently characterized two PDE3 sub￾types (PDE3A and PDE3B) as products of distinct but re￾lated genes. To elucidate their biological roles, in this study
we compare cellular patterns of gene expression for these
two enzymes during rat embryonic and postnatal develop￾ment using in situ hybridization. PDE3A mRNA is abundant
in adipose tissue and is also expressed in hepatocytes
throughout development. This mRNA is also highly abun￾dant in embryonic neuroepithelium including the neural ret￾ina, but expression is greatly reduced in the mature nervous
system. Finally, PDE3A mRNA is localized in spermatocytes
and renal collecting duct epithelium in adult rats.
PDE3B mRNA is highly expressed in the cardiovascular
system, including myocardium and arterial and venous
smooth muscle, throughout development. It is also abundant
in bronchial, genitourinary and gastrointestinal smooth
muscle and epithelium, megakaryocytes, and oocytes.
PDE3B mRNA demonstrates a complex, developmentally
regulated pattern of gene expression in the central nervous
system. In summary, the two different PDE3s show distinc￾tive tissue-specific patterns of gene expression suggesting
that PDE3A is involved in hormonal regulation of lipolysis
and glycogenolysis, while regulation of myocardial and
smooth muscle contractility appears to be a function of
PDE3B. In addition, the present findings suggest previously
unsuspected roles for these enzymes in gametogenesis and
neural development. (J. Clin. Invest. 1995. 95:1528-1538.)

malian PDE gene families which differ in biochemical and physi￾cal properties, responses to specific effectors, inhibitors and thera￾peutic agents, and regulatory control mechanisms (1-3). PDEs
share a common domain organization pattern, all containing con￾served catalytic domains of - 270 amino acids (usually in the
COOH-terminal regions) with divergent NH2-terminal domains
(1-4). Most of the PDE gene families contain at least two
subfamilies which are products of distinct but related genes or
which arise by alternative splicing or differentially regulated tran￾scription initiation mechanisms. For example, five different type
I calmodulin-sensitive (5-7) and four type IV cAMP-specific
(8, 9) PDE subfamilies have been identified. Although in some
instances specific PDEs are relatively highly concentrated in indi￾vidual cells, such as a type H cGMP-stimulated PDE in bovine
adrenal glomerulosa cells (10), multiple PDE types are usually
present in most cells, in different amounts, proportions, and sub￾cellular locations (1, 2). Thus, intracellular cyclic nucleotide
hydrolysis is a regulated process dependent on the coordinated
and integrated activities of several structurally related but differ￾entially expressed and regulated PDE isoenzymes.
Type III PDEs (PDE3s), commonly referred to as cGMP￾inhibited cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases ( 11), have been
isolated from a number of tissues, including adipose tissue ( 12),
platelets (13), myocardium (14), vascular (15, 16) and tra￾cheo-bronchial (17, 18) smooth muscle preparations, liver (19,
20), placenta (21), and lymphocytes (22). PDE3s are charac￾terized by a high affinity for cAMP and cGMP, with the V,,.
higher for cAMP. Hydrolysis of cAMP by PDE3s is potently
inhibited by cGMP, cilostamide, and a number of compounds,
such as milrinone and enoximone, with inotropic/vasodilatory/
antiplatelet aggregatory properties ( 11, 23-27 ). The subcellu￾lar distribution of PDE3s varies, with the enzyme predominantly
microsomal in adipocytes (11, 12, 28, 29) and liver (19, 20),
cytosolic in platelets (13, 30), and both cytosolic and mem￾brane-associated in myocardium (31-33). In rat adipocytes,
activation of a particulate PDE3 is an important component in
the antilipolytic action of insulin (11, 12, 28, 29, 34, 35). Re￾sults from various studies using specific PDE3 inhibitors and
cAMP analogues suggest that PDE3s regulate cAMP pools in￾volved in the hormonal control of lipolysis, glycogenolysis,
myocardial contractility, smooth muscle relaxation, and platelet
aggregation (11, 14, 16-18, 23-27, 30, 31, 34-37). It has also
been suggested that in certain cells, e.g., platelets and lympho￾cytes, some effects of nitric oxide, which activates guanyl cy￾clase to increase cGMP, are mediated via increases in cAMP
brought about by cGMP-inhibition of PDE3s (38, 39).
We have cloned cDNAs for two cGMP-inhibited cyclic nu￾cleotide phosphodiesterases (40, 41), which in accord with the
desire to develop a common nomenclature in this field, we will
refer to as PDE3A and PDE3B. These enzymes are products of
distinct but related genes; PDE3A mRNA is highly expressed
in rat adipocytes, whereas PDE3B mRNA is highly expressed

Figure 1. PDE3A and PDE3B demonstrate distinctive patterns of gene expression in the rat fetus. A sagittal section through an embryonic day 20
(E20) fetus stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) is shown in A. That section and adjacent serial sections were hybridized to PDE3A antisense
(B) or sense (D) and PDE3B antisense (C) or sense (E) probes, and the resulting hybridization patterns are shown in film autoradiographs. PDE3A
mRNA is most abundant in adipose tissue, including the brown fat (bf ) of the dorsal fat pad and also in collections of white fat (arrowheads).
PDE3B mRNA is most abundant in the gastrointestinal (gi) and cardiovascular systems. The heart is not included in these sections, but the PDE3B
hybrids in the vasculature appear as pockmarks throughout embryonic tissues. Both transcripts are relatively plentiful in the dorsal root ganglia
(drg), bladder (b), liver (i), lung (lu), spinal cord (sc), submandibular gland (sg), and stomach (st).
in rat cardiac tissue (41). To better understand biological roles
of the two PDE3 subtypes, we have used in situ hybridization
to investigate cellular patterns of PDE3A and PDE3B gene
expression during embryonic and postnatal development in the
rat. Our results show that PDE3A and PDE3B mRNAs exhibit
unique and distinctive spatiotemporal patterns of expression,
supporting the view that each of these two enzymes serves a
cell- and developmental stage-specific biological role.

at 980C (15 s), and extension with annealing (30 s) at 66, 64, 62, and
60'C for 2 cycles each, at 580C for 28 cycles, and with final extension
at 720C for 10 min. For the PDE3A fragment, 10 ng of the full length
PDE3A in pBluescript was used as template with 100 ng forward primer,

PDE3A and PDE3B fragments, purified by electrophoresis in 1%

DH5a. Plasmids were extracted by the alkaline lysis method and di￾gested with BamHI (PDE3A) or EcoRI (PDE3B) to verify the length
of inserts and with XhoI (PDE3A) or with SacII and NdeI (PDE3B)
for determination of orientation of inserts. For linearization of the plas￾mids, each clone was digested with Sall for sense or Spel for antisense
and were used for in situ hybridization. These two antisense probes
identified distinct bands when used in Northern hybridization (data not

the DNA template was removed by digestion with DNase I at 370C
for 10 min. Radiolabeled cRNA was separated from unincorporated
nucleotides with sterile gel chromatography spin columns (Bio Spin 6;
Bio-Rad Laboratories, Richmond, CA), precipitated with 5 jil tRNA
(10 ig/ml), 10 /id NaCl (5 M), 10 til DPEC-H20, and 300 ji cold
ethanol, frozen on dry ice for 30 min, and centrifuged (10,000 g, 30
min at 40C). The purified probes were shortened to an average length
of - 150 bases by controlled alkaline hydrolysis. Average specific activ￾ity of probes generated by this protocol was 2-3 x 0l dpm/[g. Before
hybridization, sections were warmed to 250C, fixed in 4% formaldehyde,
and soaked for 10 min in 0.25% acetic anhydride/0.1 M triethanolamine
hydrochloride/0.9% NaCl. Tissue was dehydrated through an ethanol
series, dilipidated in chloroform, rehydrated, and air-dried. 35S-labeled
probes were added to hybridization buffer (107 cpm/ml) composed of
50% formamide, 0.3 M NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 5 mM EDTA,
500 jtg tRNA/ml, 10% dextran sulfate, 10 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.2%
each of BSA, Ficoll, and polyvinylpyrollidone. Hybridization buffer
was added to slides which were coverslipped and placed in humidified
chambers overnight (14 h) at 550C. Slides were washed several times
in 4 x SSC to remove cover slips and hybridization buffer, dehydrated
and immersed in 0.3 M NaCl, 50% formamide, 20 mM Tris-HCl, 1
mM EDTA at 60'C for 15 min. Sections were then treated with RNase
A (20 jig/ml) for 30 min at 370C, passed through graded salt solutions
(2x, lx, and 0.5 x SSC), followed by a 15-min wash in 0.1 x SSC
at 50°C. Slides were air dried and apposed to Hyperfilm-beta Max
(Amersham Corp., Arlington Heights, IL) for 3-6 d and then dipped
in Kodak NTB2 nuclear emulsion, stored with desiccant at 4°C for 5-
20 d, developed, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for microscopic
evaluation.
Control sense probes for PDE3A and PDE3B were used on parallel
sections from embryos and most of the adult tissues (heart, kidney,
liver, fat, and blood vessels) examined in this study and showed that
background or nonspecific signal was extremely low (Figs. 1 and 2).
Tissues from a minimum of two animals were evaluated at each time
point studied and two to six anatomically matched sections from each
sample were hybridized to each probe; the data which are reported
are based on consistent observations in multiple tissue sections. In the
developmental aspect of the study, embryo, postnatal, and adult tissues
were prepared identically, hybridized with the same batch of labeled
probe, washed, exposed, and developed together to facilitate comparison
of signal level at the different stages.
Results
Anatomical patterns of PDE3A and PDE3B gene expression
were evaluated in sagittal sections through entire E15 and E20
rat embryos. The basic patterns established at El5 are conserved
at E20 and are shown in Fig. 1. PDE3A mRNA is most abundant
in adipose tissue, including both brown and white fat (Figs. 1
and 2). It is expressed at lower levels in a diffuse pattern in
lung and liver parenchyma and throughout the nervous system

Figure 6 PDE3A and PDE3B exhibit very distinct cellular patterns of expression in the developing eye. PDE3A mRNA is concentrated in the
neural retina (re) and bow region of the lens epithelium (le, A and B). PDE3B mRNA is confined to the ganglion cell layer (gcl, C and D) where
developing capillaries are found.
(Fig. 1 B). PDE3B mRNA's distribution is clearly distinct from
that of PDE3A (Fig. 1). It is most abundant in the gastrointesti￾nal and cardiovascular systems (Fig. 1 C and Fig. 3,A-D). In
the intestine, it is concentrated in the epithelium as well as
developing smooth muscle. It is concentrated in the endothelium
and smooth muscle of arteries and veins of all caliber (Fig. 3,
A-D). The high level of PDE3B mRNA hybridization in the
E20 lung arises from the vasculature as well as bronchial smooth
muscle and epithelium (Fig. 3, C and D). PDE3B is also ex￾pressed in myocardium, first noted at E15 (Fig. 3, E and F).
PDE3A and PDE3B mRNAs are expressed in differential cell
populations of the developing brain (Fig. 1, B and C) and
demonstrate distinct developmental regulation (data not shown,
Reinhardt, R. R., and C. A. Bondy, manuscript in preparation).
Nonspecific signal as assessed by hybridization of parallel sec￾tions with sense probes for each transcript was very low (Figs.
1, D and E, and 2, E and F).
PDE3B gene expression demonstrates a highly focal pattern
in the developing liver. From E15, this mRNA is intensely
concentrated in isolated large cells, which are clearly different
from hepatocytes add the usual nonparenchymal hepatic cells.
The PDE3B-positive cells in embryonic liver are so large and
the signal so intense that they are easily visible on film autora￾diographs (Fig. 1 C). These large cells appear multinucleated
and thus are likely to be megakaryocytes which are present
along with other hematopoietic cells in fetal liver. These cells
are still found in the liver 5 d after birth (Fig. 4, A and B) but
disappear thereafter (Fig. 4, C and D), at the same time that
hepatic hematopoiesis ceases, leaving hepatic PDE3B mRNA
detected only in endothelium. In contrast, PDE3A mRNA is
diffusely expressed by hepatocytes without any apparent change
from E15 through adult life (Fig. 4, E and F). Expression
patterns for PDE3A and PDE3B were stable over time in adi￾pose tissue and vasculature, with PDE3A mRNA remaining
highly abundant in adult fat (Fig. 5, A and B) and PDE3B in
adult vasculature (Fig. 5, C and D).
PDE3A and PDE3B demonstrate very interesting patterns
of expression in the developing eye (Fig. 6). PDE3A mRNA
is highly abundant in the embryonic neural retina, which is
composed of differentiating neuroepithelial cells (Fig. 6, A and
B). This mRNA is also present in the bow region of the lens
epithelium, where the epithelial cells are differentiating

into lens fibers. PDE3B mRNA is confined to the ganglion
cell layer, where it seems to be primarily expressed by capil￾laries sprouting along the inner surface of the retina (Fig. 6, C
and D).
PDE3A and PDE3B mRNAs were also evaluated in the
developing and mature rat testis. Very little PDE3A mRNA was
detected until after puberty, when high levels appear in the
germinal epithelium (Fig. 7, A and B). The signal is most
abundant in seminiferous tubule segments engaged in early
stages of spermiogenesis where it is selectively expressed by
primary spermatocytes. PDE3B mRNA was detected only in
testicular blood vessels (Fig. 7, C and D). Interestingly, how￾ever, PDE3B mRNA was highly abundant in oocytes (Fig. 7,
E and F).
Finally, PDE3A and PDE3B gene expression was compared
in the mature rat kidney. PDE3A mRNA is selectively localized
in cortical and outer medullary collecting ducts (Fig. 8, A-C),
as well as perinephric fat (Fig. 8 A), while PDE3B mRNA is
prominently concentrated in the renal vasculature, including the
vasa rectae (Fig. 8, D-F). The tissue specificity and develop￾mental regulation of PDE3 gene expression are compared and
summarized in Table I.
Discussion
This is the first study to provide a comprehensive picture of the
cell-specific and developmental patterns of PDE3 gene expres￾sion in vivo. Although purified PDE3 preparations isolated from
various tissues exhibit similar biochemical and pharmacological
properties ( 11), these two PDE3 transcripts (PDE3A and
PDE3B) identified by molecular cloning techniques (40, 41)
demonstrate differential cellular patterns of gene expression
consistent with their derivation from separate genes subject to
independent regulation. The present results demonstrate that
PDE3A mRNA is highly expressed in adipocytes during em￾bryogenesis and throughout adult life, consistent with previous
studies on cultured rat adipocytes and differentiated 3T3-LI
adipocytes (41). PDE3A mRNA is also stably expressed in
liver, albeit at lower levels, through development. These find￾ings are consistent with a functional role for insulin activation
of adipocyte and hepatic PDE3s in regulation of hormone-stim￾ulated lipolysis and perhaps glycogenolysis (11, 19, 20, 28, 29,
34-37, 43-45). This study has also identified high level
PDE3A gene expression in spermatocytes and in neuroepithe￾lium, including the developing neural retina, where PDE3 ex￾pression had not been evaluated previously.
The cellular specificity of PDE3B mRNA expression was
clearly distinct from that of PDE3A. PDE3B mRNA was most
abundant in smooth muscle of vascular, bronchial, gastrointesti￾nal, and genitourinary systems. PDE3 activities have been inten￾sively studied in vascular and tracheo-bronchial smooth muscle
where PDE3 inhibitors promote relaxation (15-18, 24).
PDE3B mRNA was highly expressed in myocardium from the
time of myocyte differentiation into adulthood, confirming pre￾1536 Reinhardt et al.

Semiquantitative comparison of PDE3 mRNA abundance in different
cell types and across developmental stages was carried out in tissues
which were prepared, hybridized, washed, and exposed together. The
rating of relative mRNA abundance applies primarily within the columns
since there may be intrinsic differences in hybridization efficiency which
make direct comparison of signal intensity generated by different probes
problematical. Hybrid signal estimation: (-) not above background, (+)

high levels were seen in early development (although in different cell
types) followed by reduced expression in the mature nervous system.

vious Northern hybridization data (40, 41), and in presumed
megakaryocytes. In addition to the present evidence, the molec￾ular relatedness of the cardiac and platelet PDE3 is supported
by the fact that human PDE3B cDNA was cloned from a cardiac
cDNA library using oligonucleotide probes based on the amino
acid sequence of peptides isolated from proteolytic digests of
purified human platelet PDE3 (40). Furthermore, the deduced
sequence of the catalytic domain of the cardiac PDE3B cDNA
is very similar to the partial peptide sequences obtained from
the purified platelet PDE3 (40). PDE3 inhibitors serve both
as potent inotropic agents (23-25) and inhibitors of platelet
aggregation (26, 27, 30) in humans, although they are much
less effective in stimulating myocardial contractility in rats
(46). While a role for PDE3B in smooth and cardiac muscle
has been established, its function in vascular endothelium and
respiratory and gastrointestinal epithelium, where this study has
also demonstrated high level PDE3B gene expression, is as yet
unknown.
PDE3B mRNA was also found to be highly expressed in
rat oocytes. In frog (Xenopus) oocytes, insulin activation of a
cAMP phosphodiesterase is associated with oocyte maturation
and this process can be blocked by PDE3 inhibitors but not by
type IV PDE (PDE4) inhibitors (47, 48). The role of PDE3s
in oocytes and spermatocytes is unknown, but the high level of
PDE3 gene expression in rat gametes suggests, if extrapolated
to humans, that therapy with PDE3 inhibitors must consider
potential effects on germ cells. Additionally, both PDE3B and
PDE3A mRNAs are highly expressed and developmentally reg￾ulated in the nervous system. The two mRNAs are, however,
expressed by different cell populations and exhibit different
spatiotemporal profiles during development (Reinhardt, R. R.,
and C. A. Bondy, manuscript in preparation). Differential cellu￾lar patterns of expression of PDE subfamily members are not
unique to the PDE3s, as shown in two recent in situ hybridiza￾tion studies in adult rodent brain (49, 50) which demonstrated
overlapping as well as distinctive neuronal patterns of expres￾sion of the 61- and 63-kD calmodulin-sensitive PDEs (PDE1),
which are also products of different genes (5-7).
If the PDE3 steady state mRNA levels described in this
study are found to correlate with cellular enzyme levels, it will
suggest new layers of complexity to the regulation of cyclic
nucleotide phosphodiesterases and will have significant implica￾tions as to their cellular functions. In addition to understanding
mechanisms for cellular distribution and regulation of the seven
different PDE gene subfamilies (1-3), similar consideration
must now be extended to individual PDE subfamily members.
PDE3A and PDE3B each represent distinct gene products which
exhibit differential jurisdictions and which presumably will be
subject to different cell-specific mechanisms for regulation of
gene expression. Previous physiological data combined with the
present anatomical information suggest that PDE3B has a uni￾fied function in regulation of cyclic nucleotide levels in visceral
smooth muscle, platelets, and myocardium, while PDE3A pri￾marily contributes to regulating cyclic nucleotide levels in adi￾pocytes and hepatocytes. Thus PDE3A is probably devoted pri￾marily to regulation of insulin-induced lipolysis and glycogenol￾ysis while PDE3B is involved in hormonal regulation of
myocardial and smooth muscle contractility and platelet aggre￾gation. Our observations, taken together with those of others
concerning the distribution of mRNA of calmodulin-sensitive
PDEs in brain (49, 50), support the view that PDE subfamily
members serve specific functional roles. The possibility that
these two PDE3s have discrete, tissue-specific functional roles
has implications for development of therapeutic agents, in terms
of targeting drug delivery to specific cell types and the develop￾ment of inhibitors selective for specific phosphodiesterases.
