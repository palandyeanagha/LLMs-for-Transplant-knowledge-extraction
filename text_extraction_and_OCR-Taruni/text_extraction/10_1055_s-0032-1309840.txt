1.Introduction
!
Endoscopic therapy of chronic pancreatitis aims
at relieving pain. Pain is generally considered to
be multifactorial, caused by pancreatic neural re￾modeling and neuropathy, increased intraductal
and parenchymal pressure, pancreatic ischemia
and acute inflammation during an acute relapse.
Complications such as pseudocysts, strictures of
the common bile duct (CBD) and pancreatic can￾cer may also cause pancreatic-type pain. Most
nonsurgical interventions for pain in patients
with chronic pancreatitis who do not present
these complications (with “uncomplicated chron￾ic pancreatitis”) aim at relieving outflow obstruc￾tion of the main pancreatic duct (MPD). In a large
multicenter study of endoscopic therapy in
chronic pancreatitis, MPD obstruction was caused
by strictures (47 %), stones (18 %) or a combination
of both (32 %) [1]. Drainage of pseudocysts and
treatment of CBD strictures were performed in
17 % and 23 % of patients, respectively.
This Guideline on endoscopic treatment in chron￾ic pancreatitis has been endorsed by the Europe￾an Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE).
A quick reference guide summarizing its recom￾mendations is available online (Appendix e1).
Dumonceau J-M et al. ESGE Guideline for endoscopic treatment of chronic pancreatitis… Endoscopy 2012; 44: 784–796
Background and aims: Clarification of the posi￾tion of the European Society of Gastrointestinal
Endoscopy (ESGE) regarding the interventional
options available for treating patients with chron￾ic pancreatitis.
Methods: Systematic literature search to answer
explicit key questions with levels of evidence ser￾ving to determine recommendation grades. The
ESGE funded development of the Guideline.
Summary of selected recommendations
For treating painful uncomplicated chronic pan￾creatitis, the ESGE recommends extracorporeal
shockwave lithotripsy/endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography as the first-line inter￾ventional option. The clinical response should be
evaluated at 6–8 weeks; if it appears unsatisfac￾tory, the patient’s case should be discussed again
in a multidisciplinary team. Surgical options
should be considered, in particular in patients
with a predicted poor outcome following endo￾scopic therapy (Recommendation grade B). For
treating chronic pancreatitis associated with
radiopaque stones≥5mm that obstruct the main
pancreatic duct, the ESGE recommends extracor￾poreal shockwave lithotripsy as a first step, com￾bined or not with endoscopic extraction of stone
fragments depending on the expertise of the cen￾ter (Recommendation grade B).
For treating chronic pancreatitis associated with a
dominant stricture of the main pancreatic duct,
the ESGE recommends inserting a single 10-Fr
plastic stent, with stent exchange planned within
1 year (Recommendation grade C). In patients
with ductal strictures persisting after 12 months
of single plastic stenting, the ESGE recommends
that available options (e. g., endoscopic placement
of multiple pancreatic stents, surgery) be discus￾sed in a multidisciplinary team (Recommenda￾tion grade D).
For treating uncomplicated chronic pancreatic
pseudocysts that are within endoscopic reach,
the ESGE recommends endoscopic drainage as a
first-line therapy (Recommendation grade A).
For treating chronic pancreatitis-related biliary
strictures, the choice between endoscopic and
surgical therapy should rely on local expertise,
patient co-morbidities and expected patient com￾pliance with repeat endoscopic procedures (Re￾commendation grade D). If endoscopy is elected,
the ESGE recommends temporary placement of
multiple, side-by-side, plastic biliary stents (Re￾commendation grade A).

2.Methods
!
The European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) com￾missioned and funded this Guideline. The methodology, includ￾ing assessment of evidence levels and recommendation grades,
was similar to that used for other ESGE Guidelines [2]. Briefly,
subgroups were formed, each charged with a series of clearly de￾fined key questions (see Appendix e2, available online). The com￾mittee chair worked with subgroup leaders to identify pertinent
search terms that always included “chronic pancreatitis” and
words pertinent to specific key questions. Evidence tables were
generated for each key question based on the best available evi￾dence (see Appendix e3, available online). Subgroups agreed by
online communication on draft proposals that were presented
to the entire group for general discussion during a meeting held
in Brussels in May 2011. The results of that discussion were incor￾porated into the subsequent Guideline draft version and again
discussed using online communication until unanimous agree￾ment was reached. Searches were re-run in June 2011 (this date
should be taken into account for future updates). All members of
the Guideline development group approved the final draft; it was
peer-reviewed and, after modifications, sent to all individual
ESGE members in February 2012 for their comments. The final
guideline was endorsed by the ESGE Governing Board.
Evidence statements and recommendations are shown in italics
for easier reference; key evidence statements and recommenda￾tions are in bold. This Guideline will be considered for revision in
2015, or sooner if important new evidence becomes available
(any interim updates will be noted on the ESGE website: http://
www.esge.com/esge-guidelines.html).
3.Initial work-up and choice of treatment
!
Computed tomography (CT) scanning is the most sensitive and ac￾curate noninvasive method to identify pancreatic calcifications
(Evidence level 2 + ). Magnetic resonance with cholangiopancreato￾graphy (MRCP) is the best noninvasive technique to assess the
anatomy of the biliary tree (Evidence level 2 + +), of the pancreatic
ducts, and of post-necrotic pancreatic fluid collections (Evidence
level 2 +).
The ESGE recommends performing CT scanning to plan treatment of
chronic pancreatitis (Recommendation C). A combination of other
imaging modalities (e. g., MRCP or endoscopic ultrasonography
[EUS] plus CT scanning or abdominal X-ray) may be preferable in
specific circumstances (e. g., suspected anatomical variants of the
pancreatic ducts, CBD strictures, or drainage of post-necrotic pan￾creatic fluid collections) (Evidence level B).
CT scanning allows detection of pancreatic calcifications and
broad assessment of the pancreatic parenchyma. The anatomy of
pancreatic ducts, including MPD strictures and anatomical var￾iants (e. g., pancreas divisum), is best assessed using MRCP [3, 4],
including intravenous injection of secretin in selected cases [5].
For the work-up of pancreatic fluid collections, a prospective
comparative study concluded that magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) was superior to CT scanning because it depicts solid necro￾tic debris that may impede effective drainage [6]. EUS provides
similar information. These imaging modalities have not been
compared for the detection of pseudoaneurysms close to pseudo￾cysts, which is another potentially important consideration when
planning treatment.
Chronic pancreatitis is associated with an increased risk of pancreat￾ic cancer. The differential diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis vs. pan￾creatic cancer may be challenging (Evidence level 1 +). In patients
with a pancreatic mass or an MPD or CBD stricture in the context of
chronic pancreatitis, an adequate work-up should be performed to
reasonably rule out a pancreatic cancer (Recommendation grade A).
Special attention to the possibility of concurrent pancreatic can￾cer should be paid in patients > 50 years, of female gender, of
white race, presenting with jaundice, in the absence of pancreatic
calcifications, or in the presence of exocrine insufficiency, as well
as in patients with hereditary pancreatitis [7–9]. The accuracy of
standard CT scanning for the detection of pancreatic cancer is
limited in the context of chronic pancreatitis [10, 11]. Triple￾phase CT scanning with time-attenuation curves has yielded
90 % accuracy for differentiating chronic pancreatitis from pan￾creatic cancer; this examination has been recommended as a
first-choice procedure in an evidence-based algorithm for the
work-up of mass lesions in chronic pancreatitis, followed by
MRCP, EUS-FNA and positron emission tomography (PET)-CT
[12, 13]. With EUS, the differentiation between pancreatic can￾cer and focal pancreatitis is difficult (accuracy < 75 %) [14, 15];
adding EUS-guided sampling to EUS significantly improved the
diagnostic yield in one retrospective study [14]. Interestingly, in
three retrospective studies involving 1131 patients in total, the
negative predictive value of EUS-guided sampling for pancreatic
cancer was higher in the presence vs. in the absence of chronic
pancreatitis (89–94 % vs. 45–93 %) [8, 16, 17]. If EUS-guided
sampling is inconclusive, repeat EUS-guided sampling with ra￾pid on-site cytopathological examination, PET-CT, or surgical
resection are recommended [13, 18]. If a CBD stricture is treated
by ERCP in the context of chronic pancreatitis, adequate biliary
sampling should be obtained before stent insertion [19, 20].
Other diseases that may be difficult to differentiate from chronic
pancreatitis include autoimmune pancreatitis and intraductal
papillary mucinous neoplasm. For the diagnosis of these dis￾eases, the reader is referred to recent guidelines [18, 21, 22]. In
this regard, demographic data may also prove helpful because,
compared with patients with chronic pancreatitis, those with in￾traductal papillary mucinous neoplasm are significantly more of￾ten females, are older, drink less alcohol, and smoke fewer cigar￾ettes [23].
The choice between surgical and endoscopic therapy in patients
with painful uncomplicated chronic pancreatitis may be influenced
by the following considerations: (i) two randomized controlled
trials (RCTs) have shown better pain control following surgery
compared with endoscopic therapy; (ii) endoscopic therapy does
not preclude surgical treatment of chronic pancreatitis and it is
safer; (iii) predictors of satisfactory outcome following endoscopic
therapy have been identified (Evidence level 1 + ).
The ESGE recommends endoscopic therapy as the first-line therapy
for painful uncomplicated chronic pancreatitis. The clinical response
should be evaluated at 6–8 weeks; if it appears unsatisfactory, the
patient’s case should be discussed again in a multidisciplinary team
with endoscopists, surgeons, and radiologists and surgical options
should be considered, in particular in patients with a predicted poor
outcome following endoscopic therapy (Recommendation grade B).
The RCTs that have compared interventions for the treatment of
painful uncomplicated chronic pancreatitis are summarized in
●" Table 1. In the first RCT comparing endoscopic therapy vs.
surgery [24], pain was absent after 5 years of follow-up in 15 %
vs. 34 % of endoscopic therapy vs. surgery patients, respectively,
showing that neither of these options is entirely satisfactory. In
Dumonceau J-M et al. ESGE Guideline for endoscopic treatment of chronic pancreatitis… Endoscopy 2012; 44: 784–796

this RCT, endoscopic therapy was not optimal (extracorporeal
shockwave lithotripsy [ESWL] and cumulative stenting were
not used, endoscopic therapy was not repeated in the case of
recurring symptoms). In the second RCT of endoscopic therapy
vs. surgery [25, 26], the initial stenting period was relatively
short as stents were removed when the stricture had disap￾peared on the pancreatogram, but resumed in the case of pain
and stricture recurrence. This is in contrast to most other stud￾ies in which stenting is continued for 1 to 2 years. Moreover,
this RCT included only patients with advanced chronic pancrea￾titis (most of them were opioid-dependent; 79 % had strictures
and stones). For these reasons, the results cannot be extrapola￾ted to all patients with chronic pancreatitis.
Independent series from different parts of the world have report￾ed the long-term outcome after endoscopic therapy in a total of
1890 patients with chronic pancreatitis; no pancreatic surgery
was performed in 83 % of them (●" Table 2). The reluctance of
some gastroenterologists to consider surgery for the treatment
of chronic pancreatitis (in particular as a first interventional pro￾cedure) may be explained by the relatively high morbidity and
mortality associated with pancreatic surgery in the setting of
chronic pancreatitis (18–53 % and 0–5 %, respectively, for resec￾tions [27], and 0–4 % mortality for MPD drainage [28]). In con￾trast, morbidity and mortality rates for endoscopic therapy for
chronic pancreatitis are in the ranges 3–9 % and 0–0.5 %, respec￾tively (chronic pancreatitis is likely a protective factor against the
most frequent complication of ERCP, i. e., pancreatitis) [1, 29–31].
In painful chronic pancreatitis with mild changes at pancreato￾graphy according to the Cambridge classification [32], pancreatic
sphincterotomy as a single therapeutic maneuver has been pro￾posed but this has not been well studied. For example, mild
chronic pancreatitis was recorded in 14 /40 and 26 /398 patients
included in two series of endoscopic therapy for chronic pancrea￾titis but the outcome has not been reported for this particular
subgroup of patients [30, 33]. Therefore, our recommendation of
endoscopic therapy as the first-line therapy for painful uncompli￾cated chronic pancreatitis applies only to patients with moderate
or marked changes of chronic pancreatitis at pancreatography ac￾cording to the Cambridge classification.
Factors independently associated with long-term (≥2 years) pain
relief following endoscopic therapy of chronic pancreatitis in￾clude the location of obstructive calcifications in the head of the
pancreas (most robust predictor of good outcome, identified in
an RCT) [34], a short disease duration and a low frequency of
pain attacks before endoscopic therapy, complete MPD stone
clearance and absence of MPD stricture at initial endoscopic ther￾apy, as well as discontinuation of alcohol and tobacco during fol￾low-up [35–38]. Although MPD stones and strictures located in
the tail of the pancreas are accessible to endoscopic therapy, this
is more challenging compared with endoscopic therapy of similar
lesions located in the head of the pancreas and clinical success is
less certain. For that reason, when stones/dominant strictures
are located in the pancreatic tail exclusively and are deemed
responsible for pain, pancreatic tail resection is a possible first￾intent option to be discussed with the patient and surgical team.
4.Management of pancreatic stones
!
4.1.Definitions
Different classifications of pancreatic stones have been proposed,
based on radiopacity (radiolucent vs. radiopaque stones) or loca￾tion (head, body, or tail; in the MPD, secondary ducts, or intrapar￾enchymal) [39]. Successful stone fragmentation following ESWL
has been defined as stones broken into fragments≤2 or 3mm
[29, 34,40], or by the demonstration of a decreased stone density
at X-ray, an increased stone surface and an heterogeneity of the
stone which may fill the MPD and adjacent side branches [41].
The Guideline group prefers the latter definition.

4.2.Methods and results
4.2.1. ESWL combined or not with ERCP
Endoscopic attempts at MPD stone extraction without prior stone
fragmentation are plagued with low success and relatively high
morbidity rates; complications may be severe and may be ob￾served even with pancreatic stones < 10mm in diameter (Evidence
level 2 +). ESWL consistently provides stone fragmentation in 90 %
of patients (Evidence level 1 + ); it facilitates endoscopic extraction
of MPD stones (Evidence level 2 + ). Spontaneous elimination of
stone fragments resulting from ESWL occurs in approximately 80 %
of patients. ESWL alone is more cost-effective than ESWL systemati￾cally combined with ERCP (Evidence level 1 + ).
For treating patients with uncomplicated painful chronic pancreati￾tis and radiopaque stones≥5mm obstructing the MPD, the ESGE re￾commends ESWL as a first step, immediately followed by endoscopic
extraction of stone fragments. In centers with considerable experi￾ence with ESWL, ESWL alone should be preferred over ESWL system￾atically combined with ERCP (Recommendation grade B). Endoscopic
attempts to extract radiopaque MPD stones without prior stone
fragmentation should be considered only for stones < 5mm, prefer￾ably low in number, and located in the head or body of the pancreas.
Intraductal lithotripsy should be attempted only after failure of
ESWL (Recommendation grade D).
Nonsurgical clearance of stones obstructing the MPD can be
achieved by ESWL alone, by ERCP alone (always including pan￾creatic sphincterotomy), or by a combination of these techniques.
However, endoscopic attempts at MPD stone extraction using
Dormia baskets without prior stone fragmentation have yielded
unsatisfactory results: (i) a success rate of 9 % was reported in a
retrospective series of 125 patients [42]; (ii) in another retrospec￾tive multicenter series of 712 mechanical lithotripsies, the com￾plication rate was three times higher for pancreatic compared
with biliary stones [43].
ESWL is highly effective at fragmenting radiopaque pancreatic
stones: in a systematic review of 11 series involving 1149 pa￾tients in total, the success of stone fragmentation by ESWL was
89 % [44]. More recently, a large prospective single-center series
achieved stone fragmentation in 935 (93 %) of 1006 patients
[29]. Lower fragmentation rates have been reported, particularly
in low case-volume centers; this may be due to technical factors
and skill [45]. Performance of ESWL prior to endoscopic attempt
at stone removal was independently associated with the success
of MPD stone clearance in a retrospective study [35]. A meta-a￾nalysis of 17 studies (total of 491 patients) showed that ESWL is
useful for clearing MPD stones and for decreasing pain [46].
In the majority of series, stones targeted by ESWL were mostly
obstructive radiopaque MPD stones with a minimal diameter in
the range of 2–5mm [29, 34, 35, 40, 42, 45, 47, 48]. Factors signifi￾cantly associated with the success of MPD stone clearance after
ESWL included the presence of a single stone [35, 47], and con￾finement of calculi to the head of the pancreas [35]. These asso￾ciations were found only in univariate analysis and in a minority
of studies.
The use of ESWL alone for painful chronic pancreatitis was re￾ported in two uncontrolled series and an RCT. The uncontrolled
series included 350 patients followed up for 44 months; sponta￾neous MPD stone clearance was reported in 70–88 % of patients
and long-term pain relief in 78 % of patients [45, 49]. The RCT
compared ESWL alone vs. ESWL followed by ERCP in 55 patients
[34]. The only significant differences between groups were a
longer hospital stay and a higher treatment cost in the ESWL
plus ERCP group.
Morbidity related to ESWL alone or combined with ERCP was re￾viewed based on four large ( > 100 patients) series: significant
complications were reported in 104 of 1801 patients, including
one death (morbidity and mortality rates, 5.8 % and 0.05 %,
respectively) [29, 38,41,45]. Complications related to the treat￾ment of chronic pancreatitis by ESWL alone were reported in
three series that involved 165 patients; the morbidity rate was
6.0 % [34, 38,49]. For both ESWL alone or ESWL plus ERCP, compli￾cations consisted of pancreatitis in the majority of cases.
Contraindications to ESWL include coagulation disorders, preg￾nancy, implanted cardiac pacemakers or defibrillators, and pres￾ence in the shockwave path of bone, calcified aneurysms, or lung
tissue [50]. Of note, implanted cardiac pacemakers are not uni￾versally recognized as a contraindication to ESWL [51].
4.2.2. Other methods
Intraductal laser or electrohydraulic lithotripsy have provided
discordant success rates for stone fragmentation (47–83 %) in
small case series, after failure of ESWL to fragment stones [52,
53]. These techniques require nonstandard equipment and mate￾rials and are technically demanding; they are considered to be
second-line interventions after failed ESWL.
Dissolution of pancreatic stones using various substances has
been anecdotally reported [54, 55]. The efficacy of such treat￾ments has never been tested in comparative trials, and side ef￾fects may be significant. Therefore, stone dissolution therapy
may have a role only in patients in whom all other, more conven￾tional, methods have failed and who are not surgical candidates.
5.Management of main pancreatic duct strictures
!
5.1.Definitions
In chronic pancreatitis, MPD strictures may be single or multiple
and classified as dominant or nondominant. Dominant MPD
strictures are defined by the presence of at least one of the fol￾lowing characteristics: upstream MPD dilatation ≥6mm in diam￾eter, prevention of contrast medium outflow alongside a 6-Fr
catheter inserted upstream from the stricture or abdominal pain
during continuous infusion of a nasopancreatic catheter inserted
upstream from the stricture with 1 L saline for 12–24 h [56].
Treatment of a dominant MPD stricture is defined as technically
successful if at least one stent is inserted across the stricture
(treatment by dilation alone has been abandoned). With regard
to clinical success, many definitions have been used, ranging
from doctor’s opinion to validated pain scores. The ESGE recom￾mends that future studies should use validated pain scores for
both short-term and long-term evaluation of clinical success. For
long-term evaluation, absence of pain (relapse) at 1 year post
stent retrieval seems a reasonable and workable definition.
5.2.Methods and results
The reader is referred to a recent ESGE publication for an over￾view of the principles and technique of stricture treatment by
continued dilation using temporary stent placement [57]. Points
relevant to pancreatic stenting only are briefly discussed below:
▶ Pancreatic sphincterotomy (at the level of the major or minor
papilla) has consistently been performed prior to MPD stent￾ing in all large studies [37, 58–65], in contrast to what has
been reported for biliary stenting.
▶ Biliary sphincterotomy should be combined with pancreatic
sphincterotomy only in selected cases according to an RCT, i. e.
Dumonceau J-M et al. ESGE Guideline for endoscopic treatment of chronic pancreatitis… Endoscopy 2012; 44: 784–796
Guidelines 787

in patients with cholangitis, jaundice (bilirubin ≥3mg/dL), a
dilated CBD (≥12mm) associated with elevated alkaline phos￾phatases (> 2 upper limit of normal values), or in case of diffi￾cult access to the MPD [66].
▶ Stricture dilation is performed prior to stenting in most cases
because chronic pancreatitis-related MPD strictures may be
very tight and resilient. If bougies or balloons cannot pass the
stricture, the Soehendra stent retriever may serve as a rescue
option [67].
Pancreatic stenting is technically successful in 85–98 % of at￾tempted cases [58–60, 64]; it is immediately followed by pain re￾lief in 65–95 % of patients [58–61, 63–65, 68]; during follow-up
(14–58 months), pain relief has been reported in 32 %–68 % of
patients [25, 37, 59–61, 63, 64, 68].
5.2.1. Plastic stents
Polyethylene 10-Fr pancreatic stents tailored to the shape of the
MPD and length of the stricture are most commonly used. Occlusion
of MPD stents usually occurs within 2–3 months (Evidence level 2–)
while symptoms of chronic pancreatitis usually recur between 6 and
12 months (Evidence level 2 + ). Thinner MPD stents (≤8.5 Fr) are
associated with more frequent hospitalizations for abdominal pain
than 10-Fr stents. Placement of a single pancreatic plastic stent
achieves MPD stricture resolution in nearly 60 % of cases (Evidence
level 2 + ) while simultaneous placement of multiple pancreatic
stents was reported to be of additional benefit in a single study (Evi￾dence level 2–). Complications related to MPD stenting are usually
mild and managed conservatively (Evidence level 2 + ).
The ESGE recommends treating dominant MPD stricture by inserting
a single 10-Fr plastic stent, with stent exchange planned within 1
year even in asymptomatic patients to prevent complications related
to long-standing pancreatic stent occlusion (Recommendation grade
C). Simultaneous placement of multiple, side-by-side, pancreatic
stents could be applied more extensively, particularly in patients
with MPD strictures persisting after 12 months of single plastic stent￾ing. At this time point, the ESGE recommends that available options
(e. g., endoscopic placement of multiple simultaneous MPD stents,
surgery) be discussed by a multidisciplinary team (Recommendation
grade D).
●" Table 3 summarizes selected studies of MPD stenting. Because
MPD stenting for a short predefined (6-month) duration has
been shown to be poorly effective [59], MPD stenting is per￾formed for longer periods. Criteria used for terminating MPD
stenting are as follows: (i) adequate pancreaticoduodenal out￾flow of contrast medium 1–2 minutes after ductal filling up￾stream from the stricture location, and (ii) easy passage of a 6-Fr
catheter through the stricture location [60, 62, 68]. After pro￾longed MPD stenting, relapsing pain was observed in 36–48 % of
patients after “definitive” stent removal, re-stenting was indica￾ted in 22–30 % of patients, and 4–26 % of patients had pancreatic
surgery. A pancreas divisum anatomy might require longer/mul￾tiple stenting because it is associated with more frequent relapse
of MPD stricture and of pain after stent removal compared with
MPD stenting in patients with a fused pancreas [62].
Stent occlusion is the most frequent complication of MPD stent￾ing; it is treated by stent exchange that may be performed either
at regular intervals (e. g., 3 months) [61], or “on-demand,” i. e.,
when symptoms develop [62, 68]. The aim of an “on-demand”
stent exchange schedule is to reduce the number of ERCP ses￾sions; it is based on the fact that pain relapse most frequently oc￾curs a long time after stent occlusion [69]. Drawbacks of the “on￾demand” stent exchange schedule include rare occurrence of
pancreatic abscesses and sepsis [58, 68], and failure to decrease
the number of ERCP sessions (four to five in large studies) [62,
68].
Stents measuring 8.5 Fr or 10 Fr in diameter are used in most
studies. In a retrospective study of 163 patients, those who had
received thin stents (≤8.5 Fr) were 3.2 times more likely to be
hospitalized for abdominal pain than those who had received
10-Fr stents [70].
The role of multiple pancreatic stents was investigated in a single
study that involved 19 patients [71]. The stricture was located in
the head of the pancreas and it persisted after at least two place￾ments of a single stent. A median of three simultaneous stents
were inserted for a mean period of 7 months; persistent pain re￾lief was noted in 84 % of the patients after 38 months of follow￾up.
The morbidity of pancreatic stenting is in the range of 6–39 %
[37, 58–62, 64, 65, 68]. It most frequently consists of mild pan￾creatitis; proximal or distal stent migration as well as pancreatic
abscesses requiring surgery have rarely been reported.
5.2.2. Self-expandable metallic stents (SEMSs)
Patency of pancreatic SEMSs is short with regard to the life expec￾tancy of patients with chronic pancreatitis (Evidence level 2–). Pre￾liminary studies suggest that temporary placement of fully covered
SEMS is safe and allows resolution of MPD strictures plus pain relief
in a majority of patients but no follow-up longer than 1 year is
available (Evidence level 2 +).
Uncovered SEMSs should not be inserted in MPD strictures (Recom￾mendation grade D); temporary placement of fully covered SEMSs
holds promise but it should be performed only in the setting of trials

with approval of the institutional review board (Recommendation
grade C).
Historical series have shown that the patency duration of SEMSs
left in place in the MPD was limited to approximately 1 year [72].
Therefore, SEMS insertion without scheduled removal is not per￾formed anymore, as is the case for benign biliary strictures [19].
More recently, two centers have reported three prospective ser￾ies that used temporary placement of fully covered SEMSs to
treat chronic pancreatitis-related MPD strictures. Three different
types of SEMS were inserted and left in place for 2–3 months in
51 patients [73–75]. Stent removal was successful in all of 46 at￾tempted cases. No pain relapse was noted in 43 of 50 patients
(86 %) during mean follow-up periods of 5 months following
SEMS removal. Complications included SEMS migration in a sin￾gle study (31 % of 13 patients) and de novo focal MPD strictures
(16 % of 32 patients) [73, 75].
5.2.3. Endosonography-guided access and drainage
(ESGAD) of the MPD
Experience with ESGAD of the MPD is limited to a small number of
reported cases with short follow-up. ESGADwas effective in obtain￾ing MPD drainage and pain relief in selected patients with chronic
pancreatitis, with morbidity usually being mild and no reported
mortality (Evidence level 3). ESGAD of the MPD is indicated in care￾fully selected patients; patients considered for ESGAD should be re￾ferred to tertiary centers with appropriate equipment and exper￾tise (Recommendation grade D).
Potential indications for ESGAD of the MPD include patients with
a symptomatic MPD obstruction and failed conventional transpa￾pillary MPD drainage. Briefly, the technique consists of punctur￾ing the MPD through the gastric or duodenal wall, obtaining a
pancreatogram and advancing a guide wire into the MPD to pro￾ceed with transpapillary (rendezvous technique) or transmural
drainage [44].
Approximately 75 cases of ESGAD of the MPD have been reported
[76–81]; follow-up for individual cases ranges from a few weeks
up to 55 months (median, 1 year). Immediate pain relief after suc￾cessful ESGAD of the MPD has been reported in a majority of pa￾tients with painful obstructive chronic pancreatitis (range, 50 %–
100 %). In the largest series to date (n = 36), complete or major
pain relief was achieved in 69 % of patients but the probability of
remaining free of pain sharply dropped with time, to 20 % after
450 days [79]. A malignant etiology for complete MPD obstruc￾tion should always be sought as 5 patients out of 36 in this series
had a diagnosis of cancer within a year of the procedure [79].
The morbidity rate of ESGAD of the MPD varies between 0 and 44
%; it mostly consists of relatively mild post-procedure pain, but
severe pancreatitis, perforation, bleeding, and hematoma have
been reported [76–81]. No procedure-related mortality has
been reported. Migration and occlusion of stents frequently occur
(20 % to 55 % of patients), necessitating endoscopic re-interven￾tion. ESGADis a technically challenging procedure [79].
6. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided celiac plexus block
!
EUS-guided celiac plexus block (CPB) provides temporary pain re￾lief in approximately half of patients with chronic pancreatitis.
EUS-guided CPB is superior to percutaneous CT-guided CPB in
terms of pain control and of patient preference (Evidence level 1–).
The ESGE recommends considering CPB only as a second-line treat￾ment for pain in chronic pancreatitis; EUS-guided CPB should be
preferred over percutaneous CPB (Recommendation grade C).
During CPB, a mixture of corticoids with a local anesthetic is in￾jected into celiac plexus nerves to disrupt the signaling of painful
stimuli through pancreatic afferent nerves (celiac plexus neuro￾lysis, it should be noted, uses alcohol and is reserved to patients
with cancer-related pain) [82].
Meta-analyses have reported that EUS-guided CPB provides pain
relief in 51 %–59 % of patients with painful chronic pancreatitis
[83, 84]; however, pain relief is transient [84]. For example, in a
prospective series of 90 patients, the proportion of patients with
pain relief decreased from 55 % immediately after EUS-guided
CPB to 10 % at 24 weeks [85]. Because no RCT has included a
sham group, a placebo effect cannot be excluded. A recent RCT
has assessed the benefit of adding triamcinolone to bupivacaine
for patients with painful chronic pancreatitis [86]; only 15 % of
the patients had a significant pain decrease at 1 month with ad￾dition of triamcinolone showing no difference.
In two RCTs, EUS was superior to CT guidance for CPB in terms of
duration of pain relief and of patient preference [87, 88]. Another
theoretical advantage of the EUS-guided route is the absence of
reported severe complications such as paraplegia and aortic
pseudoaneurysms [89, 90]. The most common complications of
EUS-guided CPB include transient diarrhea, hypotension, and
pain exacerbation, with an incidence of up to 33 % [84].
7. Pancreatic pseudocysts
!
7.1.Definitions
Pancreatic pseudocysts (PPC) develop during the course of chron￾ic pancreatitis in 20–40 % of patients [91]. The Atlanta classifica￾tion defines a PPC as a collection of pancreatic juice enclosed by a
wall of fibrous granulation tissue, which arises as a consequence
of acute pancreatitis, pancreatic trauma, or chronic pancreatitis
[92]. It further distinguishes acute PPC (associated with acute
pancreatitis more than 4 weeks previously) and chronic PPC
(arising in patients with chronic pancreatitis and no antecedent
acute pancreatitis). Endoscopic therapy of PPC consists of insert￾ing a drain from the digestive lumen into the PPC, through the di￾gestive wall (“transmural drainage”), through the papilla (“trans￾papillary drainage”), or a combination of these routes. Transpa￾pillary PPC drainage is feasible only in the case of direct commu￾nication between the PPC and the MPD, which occurs in 40–66 %
of all PPCs [93–95]. Technical success is usually defined as the
ability to insert at least one stent from the PPC to the digestive lu￾men [96, 97], or resolution of the fluid collection but not neces￾sarily of symptoms [98]. Short-term clinical success is usually de￾fined as complete relief of the initial symptoms with a decrease in
PPC diameter of at least 30–50 % at 1 month [99].
7.2.Indications for treatment
Universally accepted indications for PPC treatment include the
presence of symptoms (abdominal pain, gastric outlet obstruction,
early satiety, weight loss, or jaundice) and infected or enlarging
PPC. Compared with surgery, endoscopic drainage of uncompli￾cated PPC provides similar long-term results at a lower cost, with
shorter hospital stay, and better quality of life during the first
months following treatment. Procedure-related mortality is slightly
lower with the endoscopic method (Evidence level 1 +).
Dumonceau J-M et al. ESGE Guideline for endoscopic treatment of chronic pancreatitis… Endoscopy 2012; 44: 784–796
Guidelines 789
Downloaded by: NYU. Copyrighted material.

The ESGE recommends endoscopic therapy as the first-line therapy
for uncomplicated chronic PPCs for which treatment is indicated
and that are within endoscopic reach (Recommendation grade A).
Besides the universally accepted indications for PPC treatment
that are listed above [100], treatment for prophylaxis of potential
PPC-related complications in asymptomatic patients has been ad￾vocated by some authors (although such complications occur in <
10 % of patients during follow-up) [101, 102]. Suggested indica￾tions for prophylactic treatment include compression of major
vessels, intracystic hemorrhage, pancreaticopleural fistula, PPC >
5 cm without any regression after > 6 weeks, cyst wall > 5mm, and
PPC in the setting of chronic pancreatitis with advanced MPD
changes or pancreaticolithiasis [103]. Treatment of asymptomat￾ic PPC in chronic pancreatitis is supported by the low (0–9 %) rate
of spontaneous PPC resolution in patients with established
chronic pancreatitis in most series [104]. A single series reported
a higher (26 %) resolution rate, which was observed after a long
follow-up (median time to resolution, 29 weeks) [105].
In an RCT that compared endoscopic (EUS-guided) drainage vs.
surgery for uncomplicated PPC, endoscopic drainage was signifi￾cantly better than surgery in terms of cost, length of hospital stay,
and quality of life up to 3 months post-procedure [106]. At a me￾dian follow-up of 18 months, clinical outcomes and quality of life
were similar for both allocation groups. A large review of non￾comparative historical series of endoscopic and surgical treat￾ments that included 787 patients showed similar morbidity
(13.3 % vs. 16.0 %, respectively) and long-term pseudocyst recur￾rence (10.7 % vs. 9.8 %, respectively) but lower mortality with the
endoscopic method (0.2 % vs. 2.5 %, respectively) [107].
7.3.Methods and results
In the absence of luminal bulging, transmural drainage of PPC is
feasible under EUS guidance only, with complication and success
rates similar to those of conventional transmural drainage (Evi￾dence level 1 +). Compared with transmural drainage, transpapil￾lary drainage provides similar long-term success and is associated
with fewer complications but it has been performed for relatively
small collections only (generally ≤50mm). Compared with cysto￾gastrostomy, cystoduodenostomy may provide better long-term
success (Evidence level 2–). After transmural PPC drainage, early
(2-month) stent removal is associated with a high likelihood of
PPC recurrence (Evidence level 1–). Single transmural stents do
not yield long-term success as frequently as multiple stents;
straight transmural stents are associated with relatively frequent
and severe complications (Evidence level 2–). Mortality associated
with hemorrhage from pseudoaneurysms close to PPCs is high (Evi￾dence level 1 +).
If transmural pseudocyst drainage is indicated in the absence of lu￾minal bulging, it should be performed under EUS guidance (Recom￾mendation grade A). For small collections communicating with the
MPD in the head or body of the pancreas, the ESGE recommends at￾tempting transpapillary drainage first. Cystoduodenostomy should
be preferred over cystogastrostomy if both routes are deemed equal￾ly feasible. For transmural PPC drainage, the ESGE recommends in￾serting at least two double-pigtail plastic stents (Recommendation
grade D); these should not be retrieved before cyst resolution as de￾termined by cross-sectional imaging and not before at least 2
months of stenting (Recommendation grade B). In the case of portal
hypertension, transmural drainage should be performed under EUS
guidance. If arterial pseudoaneurysms are detected in the vicinity of
the PPC, arterial embolization should be considered prior to PPC
drainage (Recommendation grade D).
Transpapillary and transmural PPC drainages were compared in
three nonrandomized studies that included 173 patients (chronic
pancreatitis was diagnosed in 40–92 % of them) [95, 98,108].
Transpapillary drainage was used for smaller PPCs than trans￾mural drainage. We calculated that transpapillary drainage was
associated with lower morbidity (1 /56 [1.8 %] vs. 18 /117 [15.4 %]
patients; P= 0.008) and similar long-term success (53 /56 [94.6 %]
vs. 105 /117 [89.7 %] patients; P= 0.391) than transmural drain￾age.
For transmural PPC drainage, technical success was higher with
EUS compared with conventional guidance in two RCTs
[97, 109]. All patients with failed conventional drainage had a
successful EUS-guided drainage. Per-protocol analysis showed
no difference between groups in terms of morbidity and clinical
outcome. Failures of conventional drainage were related to the
absence of intraluminal bulging, which is observed in approxi￾mately half of PPCs [95].
In a review of seven historical series that reported results sep￾arately for 121 patients treated by either cystoduodenostomy or
cystogastrostomy, cystoduodenostomy more frequently yielded
long-term success (59 /71 [83.1 %] vs. 32 /50 [64.0 %]; P= 0.019),
with identical morbidity (10 %) [110]. This could be related to a
longer patency of cystoduodenal compared with cystogastric fis￾tulas [110–112].
After transmural PPC drainage and PPC resolution, early stent re￾moval was associated with more PPC recurrences compared with
stent maintenance in an RCT of 28 patients (15 had chronic pan￾creatitis) [113]. In a retrospective study of 92 patients, PPC drain￾age with a single stent and a stenting duration ≤6 weeks were in￾dependently associated with failure of endoscopic treatment (de￾fined as severe procedure-related complication or need for an￾other treatment modality) [96]. In this series, straight stents
were used and they were associated with frequent bleeding (7 %
of patients, with surgery required in two thirds of them) and
stent migration. The authors advocated using double-pigtail
stents.
Pseudoaneurysms may be detected in the setting of chronic pan￾creatitis, particularly where there is complication with a PPC
[114]. In the largest review of hemorrhages associated with a
PPC (126 episodes), overall mortality was 19 % [114]. Therefore,
some authors recommend embolization of arterial pseudoaneur￾ysms before attempting drainage of PPCs close to pseudoaneur￾ysms [115]. Finally, extrahepatic portal hypertension develops
during the course of chronic pancreatitis in ≥15 % of patients
[116]. Some authors recommend EUS-guided PPC drainage in
cases of portal hypertension, to decrease the risk of bleeding
[117]; this strategy has not been compared with conventional
transmural drainage but it has been reported to be safe in a small
series of patients [118].
7.4. Particular case: complete MPD rupture
PPC resolution in the case of a complete MPD rupture is achieved
less frequently compared with clinical situations without complete
MPD rupture; the risk of PPC relapse may also be higher. A stent
bridging the MPD rupture (which may allow MPD healing) and a
long stenting duration are associated with better long-term success
(Evidence level 2–).
The ESGE recommends, besides transmural PPC drainage, attempt￾ing transpapillary bridging of MPD ruptures with a plastic stent. If
the MPD rupture cannot be bridged, transmural stents should be
left in place for as long as the disconnected pancreatic tail secretes
pancreatic juice (typically, for years) (Recommendation grade D).
Dumonceau J-M et al. ESGE Guideline for endoscopic treatment of chronic pancreatitis… Endoscopy 2012; 44: 784–796
790 Guidelines
Downloaded by: NYU. Copyrighted material.

In the case of complete MPD rupture without effective drainage,
the disconnection of the pancreatic tail may lead to fluid accu￾mulation. Initial PPC resolution after endoscopic treatment has
been reported in 61 % of 97 patients with a complete MPD rup￾ture (with or without chronic pancreatitis) [119–122]. Bridging
of complete MPD ruptures is possible in some cases [121, 122]. A
combination of transmural PPC drainage and a transpapillary
stent bridging the MPD rupture may improve success [123]. In a
retrospective study of 97 patients with partial or complete MPD
rupture treated transpapillarily, factors associated with a suc￾cessful outcome included a partial MPD rupture, a stent bridging
the rupture and a long stenting duration [120]. In a series in
which transmural stents were removed once PPC had resolved,
half of the PPCs recurred [119]. In contrast, persisting long-term
success was reported in 11 of 12 patients who had prolonged
stenting [121].
7.5. Complications
Morbidity and mortality of endoscopic PPC drainage are approxi￾mately 13 % and 0.3 %, respectively. Secondary PPC infection may
complicate PPC drainage (Evidence level 1 +); no data on the effica￾cy of antibiotic prophylaxis in this setting are available.
The ESGE recommends antibiotic prophylaxis for endoscopic PPC
drainage (Recommendation grade D).
Figures stated above were reported in a recent review of 24 stud￾ies involving a total of 1126 patients with wide variations in mor￾bidity between studies (3 %–34 %) [44, 103]. Major complications
included hemorrhage, perforation, and infection; most of these
were managed by nonoperative means, including local coagulati￾on or arterial embolization for bleeding, repeat endoscopic drain￾age for secondary infection, and antibiotics for retroperitoneal
perforation [99, 124,125]. Antibiotic administration immediately
before transmural or transpapillary PPC drainage is recommen￾ded in recent guidelines based on expert opinion [126]. The deci￾sion about antibiotics continuation after the procedure should be
guided by the adequacy of PPC drainage and the presence or ab￾sence of necrosis [100].
8. Chronic pancreatitis-related biliary strictures
!
8.1.Definitions
Biliary obstruction complicates the course of chronic pancreatitis
in 3 %–23 % of patients [127]. Different cholangiographic types of
chronic pancreatitis-related biliary strictures have been de￾scribed, the type being suggestive of the etiology of biliary ob￾struction (fibrosis, compression by a pseudocyst or cancer) [128].
8.2.Indications for treatment
The ESGE recommends treating chronic pancreatitis-related biliary
strictures in the case of symptoms, secondary biliary cirrhosis, bili￾ary stones, progression of biliary stricture, or asymptomatic eleva￾tion of serum alkaline phosphatase (> 2 or 3 times the upper limit of
normal values) and/or of serum bilirubin for longer than 1 month
(Recommendation grade A).
The abovementioned indications are generally accepted [129].
8.3.Methods and results
Temporary placement of simultaneous multiple plastic stents is
technically feasible in > 90 % of patients with benign CBD strictures;
it is the endoscopic technique that provides the highest long-term
biliary patency rate in chronic pancreatitis-related biliary stric￾tures (65 %); complete therapy requires approximately four ERCPs
over a 12-month period. Possible stricture relapses after stenting
are usually successfully re-treated by ERCP. Temporary placement
of single plastic stents provides poorer patency rates; treatment
with uncovered SEMSs is plagued with a high long-term morbidity;
temporary placement of covered SEMSs is an investigational option
(Evidence level 1 +). Some series of patients treated with plastic
stents for CBD strictures related to alcoholic chronic pancreatitis
have been reported to have a relatively high incidence of cholangi￾tis, including fatal cases, due to poor patient compliance with
scheduled stent exchanges. Comparative studies of surgical and en￾doscopic treatments in patients with benign biliary strictures
related to a trauma have reported similar long-term results; no
comparative data are available for chronic pancreatitis-related
biliary strictures (Evidence level 2–).
The choice between endoscopic and surgical treatment should rely
on local expertise, local or systemic patient co-morbidities (e. g., por￾tal cavernoma, cirrhosis) and expected patient compliance with re￾peat endoscopic procedures (Recommendation grade D). If endo￾scopic therapy is elected, the ESGE recommends temporary (1-year)
placement of multiple, side-by-side, plastic biliary stents (Recommen￾dation grade A). Because of the risk of fatal septic complications, a
recall system should be set up to care for patients who do not pres￾ent for scheduled stent exchanges. In cases of relapsing stricture
after stent removal at 1 year, the options available, including surgi￾cal biliary drainage, should be evaluated by a multidisciplinary
team (Recommendation grade D).
A malignant etiology of the stricture should always be sought, at
least by biliary brushing, as patients treated for supposedly be￾nign chronic pancreatitis-related biliary stricture may have a fi￾nal diagnosis of malignancy [20, 130]. The principle of endoscopic
treatment for biliary strictures consists of temporary stricture di￾lation using plastic stents (single or multiple side-by-side) or
covered SEMSs. Definitive SEMS insertion has also been reported.
In patients treated with plastic stents, various criteria have been
used to decide on when to remove stents, including cholangio￾gram and a minimum stenting duration of 1 year [131]. Amongst
benign biliary strictures, those related to chronic pancreatitis are
the most difficult to treat by temporary biliary stenting: stric￾tures less frequently resolve at the time of stent removal and
they relapse more frequently during follow-up [130, 132]. The
presence of pancreatic calcifications has been associated with
long-term failure of single plastic biliary stenting [133], but this
factor may be less relevant if simultaneous multiple plastic stents
are used [134].
Short-term (1-month) results for biliary stenting are similar for
plastic stents and SEMSs in all respects, including success rates
and complication rates (approximately 5 %). For the selection of
particular models of stents, the reader is referred to other recent
ESGE Guidelines [19, 57].
Long-term results of temporary biliary stenting for chronic pan￾creatitis-related biliary strictures are summarized in ●" Table 4.
Successful treatment was reported in 31 % of 350 patients with
single plastic stents and 62 % of 50 patients with simultaneous
multiple plastic stents. A single nonrandomized series has com￾pared long-term results after temporary treatment with single
vs. multiple simultaneous plastic stents; it showed overall clinical
success in 24 % vs. 92 % patients, respectively (P < 0.01), after sim￾ilar follow-up durations [134].
In series that used simultaneous multiple plastic stents, stent ex￾changes were scheduled at 3-month intervals and the mean ob￾served stenting duration was 12–21 months (mean number of

ERCPs, 4.0–4.7) [134–136]. According to a recent retrospective
study, the interval between stent exchanges could be extended
[137]. However, in patients with alcoholic chronic pancreatitis,
compliance with stent exchange may be problematic: in a retro￾spective series of 14 patients, only two (14.3 %) patients present￾ed for elective stent exchanges although written instructions
were given to the patients and primary care physicians for doing
so [138]. Another retrospective series reported an observed
mean interval between stent exchanges of 6.4 months although
these were scheduled at 3-month intervals; there were at least
20 episodes of cholangitis in a total of 29 patients, of which two
were fatal [135]. Of note, in the latter series, stents were exchan￾ged at ERCP only if they were clogged. Protocols aiming at lower￾ing stenting duration and/or the number of ERCPs are being ex￾plored:
▶ In patients with biliary strictures complicating orthotopic liver
transplantation, plastic stents were exchanged with a higher
number of stents every 2 weeks until complete waist disap￾pearance at the level of the anastomosis, and were then left in
place for 3 months [139].
▶ In patients with chronic pancreatitis, temporary treatment
with partially or fully covered SEMSs has been reported in
small series of patients using different SEMS models and with
different results. Limitations include failure to remove stents
and short follow-up after covered SEMS removal in currently
available studies [140].
▶ Definitive insertion of uncovered or partially covered SEMS
has been abandoned because of disappointing long-term re￾sults in benign biliary strictures [141–143].
No comparison of various stenting durations has been reported
in the literature (scheduled stenting duration with multiple plas￾tic stents and covered SEMSs has generally been for 1 year and for
3–6 months, respectively) [132, 134–136, 140, 144]. Stent dys￾function has been reported in 8–69 % and 5–33 % of patients
treated with temporary insertion of multiple plastic stents and
of covered SEMSs, respectively [132, 134–136, 140, 144]. The
costs of these two methods have not been compared.
No study has compared endoscopic biliary stenting vs. surgical
biliodigestive anastomosis for chronic pancreatitis-related biliary
stricture. Two nonrandomized studies have compared endoscopy
vs. surgery for the treatment of benign biliary strictures related
to trauma (cholecystectomy in most cases). One of these studies
reported similar morbidity (35 % vs. 26 %) and absence of stricture
relapse (17 % in both groups) during follow-up in 101 patients
[145]. The other study found that endoscopic treatment was
associated with a higher morbidity rate (45 % vs. 9 %; P= 0.01),
shorter total hospital stay (6 vs. 11 days; P= 0.001), and similar
success at≥5 years (80 % vs. 77 %) in 42 patients [146].
9. Treatment of chronic pancreatitis in children
!
The main indication for endoscopic therapy of chronic pancreatitis
in children is pain. (Evidence level 2 +). After endoscopic therapy for
chronic pancreatitis the majority of children have lesser symptoms
and less hospital admission during long-term follow-up. The main
complication of endoscopic therapy for chronic pancreatitis in chil￾dren is acute pancreatitis, which is usually mild or moderate. (Evi￾dence level 2–).
The ESGE recommends endoscopic therapy as a first-line therapy
for chronic pancreatitis in children starting at 8 years in the same
conditions as in adults (Recommendation grade C).
A recent, retrospective, large Danish study of chronic pancreatitis
in young adults (< 30 years old) showed that the standardized
prevalence ratio of chronic pancreatitis increased between
1980–1984 and 2000–2004 [147]. The most frequent etiologies

are idiopathic and genetic; a retrospective case series from Ger￾many found genetic mutations in 30 % of 146 patients with
chronic pancreatitis younger than 18 years [148]. The disease
usually presents as episodes of moderate abdominal pain [149];
a retrospective study showed that, compared with adults, pedia￾tric patients had less severe chronic pancreatitis stages, and a
lower prevalence of pseudocysts, of calcifications, and of chronic
pancreatitis-related CBD biliary strictures [150].
Three retrospective case series evaluated endoscopic therapy for
pain in children with chronic pancreatitis [151–153]. In two
studies [151, 153], the majority of patients had a subjective im￾provement of their disease and a decrease in hospital admissions
following endoscopic therapy. In the third study, recurrence of a
flare of chronic pancreatitis was more frequent after endoscopic
as compared with surgical treatment (75 % of 12 patients vs. 39 %
of 25 patients, respectively). Regarding treatment-related com￾plications, mild and moderate acute pancreatitis was encounter￾ed in 17 % and 6 % of cases, respectively [151, 153].
