Abstract
Laparoscopic pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy is being performed more
frequently because of improved surgical techniques. Although several studies have demon￾strated safety and favourable outcomes of laparoscopic pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduo￾denectomy compared to open pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy, few studies
have focused on the development of postoperative acute kidney injury. This retrospective
study compared the prevalence and risk factors of acute kidney injury following laparoscopic
and open pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy. Data from 809 patients who
underwent pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy between February 2012 and Sep￾tember 2016 were analysed. Patients were divided into two groups according to the surgical
procedure (open pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy [n = 632] vs laparoscopic
pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy [n = 177]). The Kidney Disease: Improving
Global Outcomes criteria were used to define postoperative acute kidney injury and risk fac￾tors were investigated using multivariable logistic regression analysis with propensity score
matching analysis and standardized mortality ratio weighting to compare outcomes. No sig￾nificant differences were found in the occurrence of postoperative acute kidney injury and
incidence of postoperative ICU admission between open and laparoscopic pylorus-preserv￾ing pancreaticoduodenectomy groups after propensity score matching (p = 1.000, p =
0.999, respectivelyand standardized mortality ratio weighted analysis (p = 0.619, p = 0.982,
respectively). Hospital stay was significantly shorter in the laparoscopic pylorus-preserving
pancreaticoduodenectomy group (propensity matched set, mean [SD], 16.7 [10.0] vs. 18.7
[9.6] days, p = 0.004; standardized mortality ratio, 16.6 [9.9] vs. 18.1 [8.8] days, p = 0.001).
There was no significant difference in postoperative acute kidney injury incidence between
both groups. Laparoscopic pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy is promising with
comparable postoperative outcomes to open pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy
and has the advantage of shorter hospital stay.

Introduction
With the improvement of surgical techniques, the scope of minimally invasive surgery has also
expanded. Laparoscopic pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy (LPPPD) has been
reported to be safe and feasible with acceptable outcomes despite its technical difficulties [1, 2].
Studies comparing LPPPD with open pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy (OPPPD)
have addressed either favorable oncological outcomes or surgical outcomes to date [3, 4].
Acute kidney injury (AKI) is known to be associated with poor postoperative outcomes
including short-term and long-term mortality [5–7]. AKI is a common complication following
cardiac surgery and is associated with increased long-term mortality in coronary artery bypass
graft surgery and cardiac valve operations [7–10]. In case of noncardiac surgery, the incidence
of AKI is approximately 1%, which increases up to 32% after major surgery, and is also signifi￾cantly associated with high mortality [6, 11, 12]. Furthermore, AKI episodes with a slight
increase in serum creatinine (sCr) have been reported to increase long-term mortality after
major surgery, even if renal function was restored during the hospitalisation [6].
In laparoscopic surgery, relatively less surgical trauma and systemic inflammatory
responses may influence the incidence of AKI [13, 14]. However, few studies have focused on
the development of postoperative AKI in patients undergoing LPPPD or OPPPD, whereas
some researchers have reported a lower incidence of AKI after robot-assisted laparoscopic rad￾ical prostatectomy and laparoscopic liver resection than after open surgery [14, 15]. Therefore,
the aim of the present study was to compare the incidence of postoperative AKI in patients
undergoing LPPPD or OPPPD. In addition, we investigated postoperative outcomes such as
incidence of ICU admission and hospital stay after LPPPD and OPPPD.
Methods
This study was approved by our institutional review board. (Asan Medical Center Institutional
Review Board). The informed consent was waived by the institutional review board because of
the minimal risk of this retrospective study. We retrospectively collected the data of patients
who underwent LPPPD or OPPPD at our centre from February 2012 to September 2016.
Patients with incomplete data or including missing sCr values were excluded (Fig 1).

Data collection
All data including baseline characteristics, laboratory values, intraoperative information, and
outcome data of study patients were collected using a computerized patient data recording sys￾tem (Asan Biomedical Research Program, ABLE, South Korea). Sex, age, height, weight, body
mass index (BMI), underlying disease such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and cerebrovas￾cular disease, and current medications including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors,
calcium channel blockers, beta blockers, and statin, were included in the baseline characteris￾tics. Laboratory data included determination of levels of hemoglobin, platelets, aspartate trans￾aminase, alanine transaminase, total bilirubin, total protein, albumin, serum creatinine,
glucose, and sodium in addition to prothrombin time. Intraoperative data included adminis￾tered fluid volumes such as crystalloid, synthetic colloid, albumin, and transfused blood prod￾ucts such as packed red blood cell (RBC) and fresh-frozen plasma, total urine output, lowest
mean arterial pressure (MAP) recorded during the operation, and infusion of inotropes or
vasopressors.
Anesthetic technique
Anesthesia was performed according to our routine protocols. No premedication was given to
the patients. Electrocardiography, pulse oximetry, capnography, and noninvasive blood pres￾sure were monitored from the induction of anesthesia to the end of surgery. General anesthe￾sia was induced with propofol (2 mg.kg-1) and rocuronium (0.6–1.2 mg.kg-1) and maintained
with sevoflurane (1–3 vol%) and target-controlled infusion of remifentanil (2–5 ng.ml-1). After
induction, arterial catheterisation was performed for continuous blood pressure monitoring
and the central venous catheter was inserted into the internal jugular vein to infuse fluid and
monitor central venous pressure. Crystalloids including Ringer’s lactate or PlasmaLyte were
infused as maintenance fluid and synthetic colloids such as Voluven (Voluven1; Fresenius
Kabi, Bad Homburg, Germany) or 5% albumin were administered for volume replacement at
the discretion of the anesthesiologist. Appropriate packed RBC was transfused to maintain tar￾get hemoglobin level  80 g.l-1 in patients without history of ischemic heart disease and cere￾brovascular disease, and at  100 g.l-1 in patients with history of ischemic heart disease or
cerebrovascular disease. Inotropes or vasopressors were administered if the MAP was <65
mmHg.
Surgical technique
Surgical procedures followed the routine protocols established at our centre [4]. A patient
undergoing LPPPD was placed in supine position and the reverse Trendelenburg position. A
12-mm trocar was placed to establish the pneumoperitoneum, and three or four more trocars
were placed. Intraabdominal CO2 gas pressure was maintained at about 12 mmHg. In a patient
undergoing OPPPD, an approach to the surgical field was established by an inverted L or long
midline incision, and the same process of reconstruction as LPPPD was performed [2, 4].
Outcomes
The development of postoperative AKI was the primary outcome of this study. The postopera￾tive AKI was defined by the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria;
an increase of  0.3 mg.dl-1 in sCr within postoperative 2 days, an increase in sCr  1.5 times
from baseline within postoperative seven days [16]. Other outcomes including hospital stay
and postoperative ICU stay were evaluated.

Statistical analysis
Continuous variables were expressed as the mean [SD] or median [IQR]. Continuous variables
were compared using Student t-test or Mann-Whitney U test. Categorical variables are
reported as frequencies and proportions and were analysed using the Chi-square test or the
Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to detect fac￾tors associated with AKI and all variables with p<0.1 in univariate analysis were included in
the multivariable analysis. Stepwise regression analysis was done to select variables accepted in
the multivariate model.
The propensity score (PS) was estimated with groups as the dependent variables by multiple
logistic regression analysis. A full non-parsimonious model including demographics and pre￾operative variables in Table 1 was developed. Intraoperative variables were not included in the
model. Model discrimination was assessed with C-statistic (= 0.769), and model calibration
was assessed with the Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic (χ2 = 8.6581, DF = 8, p = 0.372). PS match￾ing was performed by Greedy matching using a caliper of 0.25 SDs of the logit of the PS. After
PS matching, baseline variables were compared between the two groups. Categorical variables
were compared using the McNemar test, and continuous variables were compared using the
paired t-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test as appropriate. In addition, we performed a
weighted PS analysis using standardized mortality ratio (SMR) weighting. In terms of the aver￾age treatment effect on the treated (ATT), the weights for the OPPPD group were PS/(1—PS),
and weights for patients receiving LPPPD were 1. The absolute standardized differences were
used to diagnose the balance after propensity analysis. All absolute standardized differences
after matching were less than 0.1. In the PS matched cohort, the risks of each outcome were
compared with logistic regression using Generalized Estimating Equations that accounted for
the clustering of matched pairs. Additionally, the outcomes were evaluated using weighted
regression models with PS matching and SMR weighting.
Results
Of the 846 patients enrolled, 37 patients were excluded due to incomplete data; thus, a total of
809 patients were included in this study (Fig 1). Of these, 632 patients underwent OPPPD and
177 patients underwent LPPPD. Baseline characteristics and perioperative variables of these
patients are shown in Table 1. The most common diagnosis for surgery was pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma (281/809, 34.7%), followed by intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (154/
809, 19.0%), distal common bile duct cancer (121/809, 15.0%), and ampulla of Vater cancer
(105/809, 13.0%). The patients who underwent LPPPD were younger (p<0.001), women
(p<0.001), had a lower BMI (p<0.001), and had a lower incidence of diabetes mellitus
(p<0.001) and hypertension (p<0.001). During the operation, the LPPPD group received
lower amounts of synthetic colloid (p<0.001) and fewer units of packed RBC (p = 0.011).
Operative time of LPPPD was longer than OPPPD (p<0.001). The overall AKI incidence was
5.3% (43/809).
After 1:1 PS analysis, all absolute standardized differences in demographics or preoperative
laboratory variables after matching were less than 0.1 between the OPPPD (n = 173) and
LPPPD groups (n = 173) (Table 2). After PS-matched analysis, synthetic colloids were more
frequently administered to patients undergoing OPPPD (148/173, 85.6%) than LPPPD (110/
173, 63.6%) (p<0.001), while the incidence of albumin infusion was higher in the LPPPD
group than in the OPPPD group (52.6% vs. 39.3%; p = 0.013).
In the multivariable analysis, LPPPD was not significantly associated with the development
of postoperative AKI (odds ratio [OR] 0.932, 95% confidence interval [95%CI] 0.371–2.343,
p = 0.880). Conversely, hypertension (OR 2.400, 95%CI 1.180–4.883, p = 0.016), preoperative

albumin level (OR 0.488, 95%CI 0.242–0.987, p = 0.046), and synthetic colloids infusion (OR
4.871, 95%CI 1.122–21.148, p = 0.035) were significantly associated with AKI after surgery
(Table 3).

Comparing the outcomes of the OPPPD and LPPPD group, there were no significant dif￾ferences in the occurrence of postoperative AKI (OPPPD group, 37/632 [5.9%], KDIGO stage
1/2/3, 31/1/5; LPPPD group, 6/177 [3.4%], KDIGO stage 1/2/3, 4/2/0; crude p = 0.202; PS

(Table 4). The percentage of patients in both groups at each AKI stage is shown in Fig 2. Hos￾pital stay was significantly shorter in the LPPPD group than in the OPPPD group after PS￾matching analysis and SMR weighted analysis (16.7 [10.0] vs. 18.7 [9.6] days, p = 0.004; 16.6

Discussion
In the present study, we demonstrated that there was no significant difference in the incidence
of postoperative AKI between the OPPPD group and the LPPPD group. In addition, we
showed that no difference was found in the incidence of AKI after PS matching and SMR
weighted analysis. However, patients who underwent LPPPD had a shorter period of hospital
stay than those who received OPPPD. In multivariable analysis, hypertension, preoperative

albumin level, and intraoperative synthetic colloid infusion were associated with the incidence
of postoperative AKI.
Studies have shown conflicting results regarding the effects of laparoscopic surgery on post￾operative AKI. It has been reported that increased intra-abdominal pressure may cause renal
dysfunction by alterations in renal blood flow and ischemia-reperfusion-related oxidative
stress during laparoscopic surgery [17–20]. Glomerular filtration rate, effective renal plasma
flow, and urine output were decreased in high-intra-abdominal pressure (12 mmHg) group of
patients in a study evaluating laparoscopic cholecystectomy [21]. In patients undergoing lapa￾roscopic adrenalectomy, the urine output significantly decreased during pneumoperitoneum

[22]. Conversely, a recent study comparing open and laparoscopic liver resection reported that
the incidence of postoperative AKI by KDIGO criteria was significantly lower following the
laparoscopic procedure than the open technique [14]. Moreover, in a study that measured pre￾operative and postoperative urinary N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase of patients undergoing
laparoscopic or conventional procedure, there were no differences between the groups, sug￾gesting that laparoscopic surgery is not associated with renal tubular injury [23]. Our present
study is in accordance with the aforementioned reports, in which laparoscopic surgery has no
significant effect on renal function or occurrence of AKI. Although there are temporary
decreases in renal function, this phenomenon does not seem to be clinically significant because
urinary output and renal function is restored to normal after the intra-abdominal pressure is
reduced to the baseline level, and there was no evidence of microscopic damage to the renal
tubule [17, 24].

Less bleeding and less requirement for RBC transfusion may be the possible causes of the
similar incidence of postoperative AKI between the two groups in this study, despite pro￾longed pneumoperitoneum. Hemodilution and transfusion have been reported to be associ￾ated with renal dysfunction and AKI [15, 25, 26]. However, although there were statistically
significant differences in the amount of infused packed RBCs between the two groups in our
study, the difference was not clinically significant, and the transfusion was not an independent
risk factor associated with the occurrence of AKI. This is probably due to the fact that signifi￾cant bleeding did not occur during most of the procedures in both groups.
Rather than the type of surgery, variables including history of hypertension, preoperative
albumin level, and synthetic colloid infusion were associated with the occurrence of postopera￾tive AKI. Hypertension is a known risk factor of AKI in patients undergoing general surgery
[27, 28]. In a meta-analysis of the association of risk factors including hypertension with AKI,
patients with hypertension had a higher risk of AKI at the estimated glomerular filtration rate
60 ml.min-1.1.73 m-2 or above [27]. This result is consistent with our current study, in which
hypertension is significantly associated with the occurrence of AKI.
Lower serum albumin levels are also reported to be associated with perioperative complica￾tions including AKI [29–31]. In a study of 756 cardiac transplantation recipients, the serum
albumin level was an independent predictor of postoperative AKI (OR 0.34, 95%CI 0.21–0.54)
[29]. Another retrospective study of 1309 patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty, an early
postoperative (postoperative day 2) albumin level of < 3.0 g.dl-1 was revealed to be indepen￾dently associated with the occurrence of AKI and longer hospital stay [32]. The results of our
study show that low preoperative albumin levels were also a risk factor for AKI in PPPD, fol￾lowing either laparoscopic or open surgery.
In our study, Voluven1 was used for the administration of synthetic colloids. The main
component of Voluven1 is hydroxyethyl starch (HES), which is reported to be associated with
AKI. In a prospective randomized controlled trial performed by Myburgh et al. [33] which
enrolled 7000 patients in the ICU of 32 hospitals, the use of HES was associated with increased
risk of kidney injury and renal replace therapy. However, the relationship between HES
administration and the incidence of postoperative AKI has not been clarified [34–36]. There
was no difference in the occurrence of AKI and need for renal replace therapy between the
patients who were administered HES and crystalloids in a meta-analysis which included 13 tri￾als (n = 741), thus the authors concluded that there are not enough data to identify the out￾comes related to HES [37]. Although there is still debate, our results add further weight to the
claim that HES administration is associated with the development of AKI.
Patients who received LPPPD had shorter hospital stays because of the smaller incision,
which allowed the patient to recover quickly and enabled daily life with less pain medication
[4]. This can be an advantage of LPPPD in terms of the patient’s quality of life and costs.
There are some limitations to our study. As a retrospective study, unexpected biases cannot
be excluded. The two groups have differences in their characteristics such as sex, age, underly￾ing diseases and diagnosis. Additionally, patients in the OPPPD group were administered
more fluids and had greater transfusions of packed RBCs, which means that a patient in the
OPPPD group had a greater likelihood of experiencing volume overload. These could act as
confounding factors and affect outcomes of our analysis. Therefore, we attempted to minimize
the effects of the confounding factors using PS analysis. The diagnosis for the surgery was not
considered as a dependent variable in PS matching and multivariable analysis. Features of the
disease including tumour size, lymph node invasion, and differentiation also were not consid￾ered in our present study, which may have possibly caused a bias in this study. Moreover,
malignancy can be a risk factor for AKI because of various reasons, including prerenal condi￾tion, sepsis, nephrotoxins, cytokines, and paraneoplastic conditions [38, 39]. Also, cancer itself

or its treatment can cause electrolyte imbalances and tumor lysis syndrome, which are associ￾ated with kidney injury and poor prognosis [40–42]. However, although these variables includ￾ing diagnosis and features of the disease may potentially affect long-term survival, we assumed
that these variables had less clinical impact on the occurrence of postoperative AKI according
to the type of surgery. In a matched, case-control analysis performed by Song et al. [4] where
the difference in oncologic outcome between the OPPPD and LPPPD groups was not signifi￾cant, there were also no significant differences in overall survival. Because our study was lim￾ited to a single center, it has the limitation of tending to target a relatively homogenous or
similar population. Further research is warranted to demonstrate the outcomes in heteroge￾nous populations from multiple centers.
We demonstrated that there were no significant differences in postoperative AKI incidence
between LPPPD and OPPPD groups in this study. In addition, the LPPPD is not a factor asso￾ciated with AKI. Therefore, compared with OPPPD, LPPPD may be a promising approach
with comparable postoperative outcomes in addition to the advantage of shorter hospital stay.
