Abstract. Surgery for the treatment of pancreatic cancer 
remains the gold standard, however, the identification of 
the vascular supply of the pancreas and the nearby organs 
remains a crucial difficulties in a curative resection. During 
pancreatic head resection for carcinoma dissection of regional 
arterial vasculature is mandatory. Normal coeliac and hepatic 
arterial anatomy occurs in ~50‑70% of patients and multiple 
variations have been described. Knowledge of multiple arterial 
anomalies is essential in hepato‑pancreatico‑billary surgery to 
avoid unnecessary complications. The present study presents 
coeliac trunk and common hepatic artery (CHA) anomalies 
along with their clinical importance, as reviewed according to 
the available literature. Patients diagnosed with cancer of the 
pancreatic head were hospitalized for staging and planning of 
radical surgical therapy. Computed tomography (CT) revealed 
a large tumour mass in the head of the pancreas and CHA, 
which branched directly from the superior mesenteric artery. 
A three‑dimensional CT reconstruction revealed a demon￾strative vascular anomaly, which was confirmed during an 
operation. Despite the anomalous origin of the CHA, pylorus 
preserving pancreatoduodenectomy and regional lymph node 
dissection without intraoperative complications was performed 
in each case. The patient's postoperative clinical course was 
uneventful and adjuvant chemotherapy could be administered 
without delay. In the multidisciplinary treatment of pancreatic 
carcinoma the surgeon and radiologist must be aware of the 
aberrant anatomy in order to avoid potential complications. As 
CT scans used for the preoperative staging are of diagnostic 
value for vascular anomaly, it is required for appropriate 
surgical decision making.
Introduction
The increase in the hepatobiliary and pancreatic cancer 
surgery, the anatomic variations of the celiac axis (also 
called the celiac trunk or celiac artery (CAT) in the litera￾ture) and the hepatic arteries is of paramount importance in 
hepato‑pancreatico‑billary (HPB) surgery. In the literature 
vascular anomalies in the peripancreatic region are divided 
into variations of the superior mesenteric area, the celiac trunk 
and hepatic artery. The information about the abdomen arterial 
anatomy is derived from the radiology and anatomy literature. 
Typically, coeliac trunk arises anteriorly from abdominal aorta 
at the level of twelfth thoracic vertebrae, just the aorta enters 
the abdomen. Then courses anteriorly or slightly anterolateral 
in the lesser sac and at the upper border of the pancreas divides 
into three branches: Left gastric artery (LGA), splenic artery 
(SA) and common hepatic artery (CHA) (1). A normal CAT 
anatomy was found in 89.1% of patients (1). The length of 
coeliac axis from its origin to the place where it gave of main 
branches is 1.5‑2 cm. The diameters of SA, CHA and LGA are 
5, 6 and 4 mm, respectively (2).
The patterns of hepatic arterial anatomy are not constant. 
The normal anatomy of the hepatic artery is a CHA arising 
from the coeliac axis and coursing to the point where the 
gastroduodenal artery (GDA) arises, beyond which it becomes 
the proper hepatic artery (PHA). CHA typically passes 
forward for a short distance in the retroperitoneum and then 
emerges at the superior border of the pancreas and left side 
of common hepatic duct. After arising from CAT, CHA 
turns upwards and runs lateral and adjacent to the common 
bile duct. GDA is the first branch of CHA which supplies the 
proximal duodenum and pancreas. The right gastric artery

takes off shortly thereafter and continues within the lesser 
omentum along the lesser curve of the stomach. At this point, 
CHA is referred to as PHA, which courses towards the hilum 
and soon divides into LHA and RHA. In 80% cases, RHA 
courses posterior to the common hepatic duct before entering 
the hepatic parenchyma; in 20% cases RHA may lie anterior 
to the common hepatic duct (3). This normal anatomy of CHA 
accounting for 25 to 75% of the cases (1,4,5). Anomalies 
during embryogenesis however might result in a variety of 
anatomic variants and most common variants are: From aorta: 
0.5‑2%; from SMA: 1.5‑3.5% (1,4,5). On the basis of the litera￾ture two main paths of CHA can be distinguished. These two 
variation can have a significant impact on surgical cut: i) The 
extra‑parynchemal path (outside the pancreas head)‑CHA is 
coming out SMA and is passing to the liver on the posterior 
surface of the pancreas head; in this case the dissection of 
this artery from the pancreas without pancreas head injury is 
not difficult; ii) the intra‑parynchemal path (in the pancreas 
head)‑CHA is coming out superior mesenteric artery and is 
going to the liver hilum through head parenchyma; in this 
case it might be difficult to save intra‑parenchymal part of the 
CHA (when saving of CHA is impossible it is necessary to 
reconstruct it due to performing end to end anastomosis with 
gastro‑duodenal artery).
We report two cases of associated CAT and CHA anomaly 
with their clinical importance. This paper is a retrospectively 
prepared analysis and review of the literature based on two 
independent rare cases connected with pancreatico‑billary 
surgery. The presented subject is highly in the area of interests 
of the Department of Surgical Oncology, Medical University 
of Lublin which mainly concentrate on surgery of gastrointes￾tinal tract cancers; moreover the Department is an academic 
centre and is focused on training in surgical oncology. We 
describe hepatic arterial anatomic variants: Where a hepatic 
arterial system (HAS) arising directly from SMA and traveling 
posterior to the pancreatic head and vena porta. We discuss 
the importance of these arterial variants and implications of 
surgery management.
Case reports
Case 1. (CHA originated from SMA, hepatomesenteric trunk). 
A 44‑year‑old man presented with tumour of the pancreatic 
head [diameter 1.4x1.1 cm on computed tomography (CT) 
scan]. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography 
(ERCP) revealed a common bile duct structure and atypical 
cells, and a stent was placed. CT scan demonstrated a CHA 
arising directly from the SMA (Fig. 1). Intraoperatively, a 
palpable mass 3x4 cm in the pancreatic head was found and 
suspected anomalies of the hepatic artery were confirmed 
after extended Kocher's manoeuvre and careful dissection of 
peripancreatic and retroperitoneal space with so‑called ‘artery 
first’ approach. ‘Radical’ pylorus preserving pancreatoduode￾nectomy with curative intent was performed. No postoperative 
complications were observed and patient was discharged from 
the hospital on 10th postoperative day. Pathologic evalua￾tion revealed a T4N0M0 pancreatic tubular adenocarcinoma 
resected with positive retroperitoneal margin (R1). Regional 
lymphadenectomy enabled pathological examintion of 
27 lymph nodes without metastases. On 19th postoperative 
day the patient was readmitted to the hospital due to pancre￾atic fistula type B. The complication was effectively managed 
conservatively for 16 days. Thirty five days after operation 
patient was scheduled for systemic adjuvant chemotherapy.
Case 2. (CHA originated from SMA, hepatomesenteric trunk). 
A 67‑year‑old man presented with a pancreatic head cancer. CT 
scan demonstrated focal tumour in the head of the pancreas. 
CT arteriography showed a CHA originating from the SMA 
and traveling posterior to the head of the pancreas as well as 
posterior to Vena Porta (Fig. 2). After division of the pancre￾atic neck anterior to the superior mesenteric vein, mobilization 
of the pancreas head and uncinated process exposed the CHA 
and GDA. We performed pylorus preserving pancreato￾duodenectomy sp. Traverso‑Longmire and cholecystectomy. 
Patient's postoperative hospitalization lasted 10 days. He did 
well postoperatively and pathologic evaluation confirmed 
adenocarcinoma tubulare et papillare partim gelatinosum (G1), 
pT2N1M0 with negative margins. Next pathologist examined 
44 lymph nodes and in 3 found component of cancer cells. 
Patient was qualified for systemic chemotherapy.
Discussion
Nowadays, there are many improvements and developments 
in abdomen surgical techniques: upper abdominal vide￾olaparoscopic surgeries, liver transplantation and radiological 
procedures (6,7). All of invasive procedures in the abdomen 
need for professional and wide knowledge of the anatomy of 
the CAT, HAS and their main variations. The frequency of 
inadvertent or iatrogenic hepatic vascular injury increases in 
the event of aberrant anatomy and variations. The knowledge 
of anatomical liver vascular variants is crucial for decreasing 
operative and postoperative morbidity and mortality during 
the performance of hepatic and pancreatic surgeries (7‑9). 
Fortunately, along with the development of surgical tech￾niques come the improvement in radiological visualization. 
Pre‑operative imaging can detect even up to 60‑80% of all 
artery anomalies(8). The gold standard for arterial supply visu￾alization remains angiography, nevertheless the huge impact 
of multidetector computer tomography (CT) angiography and 
modern reconstruction programs should be noted. Usage of 
maximum intensity projection and three‑dimensional volume 
rendering techniques allows the non‑invasive visualization of 
small arteries in multidetector CT angiography (10).
Arterial vascularisation of the gastrointestinal tract is 
provided by anterior branches at three different levels of 
the abdominal aorta (coeliac trunk, superior and inferior 
mesenteric arteries). Haller (1756) was described CAT 
as the trifurcation which originates on the LGA, SA and 
CHA (6,11). Since that observation many variations and 
anomalous were described (7). The normal anatomy of CAT 
and it branches is observed in 60‑89,1% of cases, while 
normal hepatic arterial supply can be seen in 52‑80.3% of 
cases (10). Most of anatomical variations come from foetal 
developmental changes in the ventral segmental arteries. 
Tandler (1904) gave an embryological explanation for 
anatomical variations of CAT (11) where explained that the 
ventral branches develop initially from the abdominal aorta 
as paired vessels, which form four roots connected by ventral 

ONCOLOGY LETTERS 15: 6251-6256, 2018 6253
longitudinal anastomosis. LGA is usually formed by the first 
root, the second root gives the beginning for the SA and the 
third root creates CHA; SMA develops from the last root, 
which migrates caudally with the gut (6,11). Quoting Morita, 
the disappearance of primitive ventral splanchnic arteries 
and longitudinal anastomosis is the reason for numerous 
anomalous of the CAT, as it was schematically presented in 
Fig. 3 (11).
In the paper we aimed to illustrate several types of 
anatomical variations of celiac trunk, hepatic artery and its 
main branches, based on description of rare clinical cases. 
We described two independent cases of such rare anomalies. 
Moreover, we also focused on surgical implications and an 
establishment of practical tips for surgeons during abdominal 
surgery especially HPB surgery.
In the literature classical course of CAT is reported with a 
frequency of 72‑90% (6,12). According to the Uflacker's clas￾sification (6,13) the most commonly observed CAT variations 
are: Hepatosplenic trunk (3% of cases), splenogastric trunk 
(4%), hepatogastric trunk (1%), hepatomesenteric trunk (<1%), 
the absence of CAT is the most rare (0,1‑4,0%) (6,10). Among 
vessel anomalities ‘accessory’ and ‘replaced’ vassels can also 
be qualified, which examples are replaced right hepatic artery 
(11‑21% cases) and replaced left hepatic artery (3,8‑10%) (8). 
In the literature coeliac trunk bifurcation is reported at a rate 
of about 12% (12).
The mostly chosen classifications for description of 
anatomical findings and possible surgical implications of 
CAT variation are presented in Table I. Regarding liver 
arterial supply, it is described as ‘normal anatomy’ when 
the CHA originates the PHA after the emergence of the 
GDA; next, the PHA separates into right and left hepatic 
arteries within the hepatoduodenal ligament. The knowl￾edge of hepatic artery supply is essential to avoid iatrogenic 
complications during HPB surgery; in the presence of 
anatomical variations accidental ligation, provoking hepatic 
necrosis, ischemic biliary injury and anastomotic fistula can 
complicate the peri‑ and postoperative course (14). With the 
grooving number of liver transplantation, the importance of 
the hepatic artery anatomy become crucial and many authors 
proposed classifications describing liver vascular variations 
based on their studies (7). The most often described hepatic 
artery anatomical variations are: i) An anomalous RHA 
from the SMA (10‑21%); ii) displaced LHA from the LGA 
(4‑10%); iii) displaced RHA and LHA; iv) an accessory RHA 
and/or LHA (1‑8%); v) displaced CHA from SMA or aorta 
(0,4‑4,5%); or vi) quadrifurcation of hepatic artery (14). In our 
study we described two independent cases of hepatic arterial 
anatomic variants where a HAS arised directly from SMA 
and traveling posterior to the pancreatic head and vena porta. 
It is named as hepatomesenteric trunk and is the second most 
common variation of HA (2‑3%) (14). Described cases belong 
to type V in Hiatt's classification (Table II).
The paper illustrates several types of anatomical varia￾tions of celiac trunk, hepatic artery and its main branches, 
based on description of two of such findings in our own 
clinical practice. However, in past decade there are several 
valuable case reports and papers (especially from liver trans￾plant centers) which share a proper approach to the subject 
of the hepatic arterial variants. The first publication which 
mentioned CHA passing through pancreatic parenchyma 
comes from Michels (1951), but it still remains unclear why 
CHA penetrates the pancreas (it might be that CHA is devel￾oped before the fusion of dorsal and ventral pancreas) (15). 
Rammohan et al (8), emphasize that hepatomesenteric trunk 
that courses through the pancreatic parenchyma can be spared

by dividing the pancreas, but there is always a risk of not 
achieving tumor‑free margins, what is essential in oncological 
surgery. If the hepatomesenteric trunk courses ventral to the 
pancreas, it can be displaced and dissected from the surface 
of the pancreas and a standard pancreaticoduodenectomy 
is performed. When a hepatomesenteric trunk has anasto￾motic connection to the LGA or another accessory artery, 
ligation will result in no compromise to the blood supply. 
In cases where the CHA is divided either inadvertently or 
for oncological purposes, it should be reconstructed using

an autologous vascular graft such as the GDA or saphenous 
vein (8,16). The knowledge of anatomical anomalies is of 
the great value during surgical interventions. The issue is 
crucial for, liver transplantation and resection, hepatic artery 
chemotherapy, gastrectomy, biliary reconstruction and 
especially for pancreatoduodenectomy (17,18). According to 
Pallisera et al (14) problems related to anatomical variations 
of hepatic artery and coeliac axis stenosis are most prevalent 
arterial complications during HPB surgery. It is highlighted 
that intraoperative arterial complications generate longer 
operative time, higher transfusion rate and more postopera￾tive complications (19).
There are some key tips which knowledge and application 
in clinical practice can be useful for HPB surgery to avoid 
unnecessary complications. First and foremost, multidetector 
CT with multidimensional reconstruction should be make in 
the preoperative management (14). Next, complete kocheri￾sation and opening the cavity, the porta hepatis should be 
palpated to determine the localization of the arterial pulsa￾tion (8). Afterwards, the decision about the surgical approach 
and intraoperative proceeding is dependent on discovered 
arterial anatomical variations. The most important hepatic 
artery anatomical variations that the surgeon must take into 
consideration during pancreatoduodenectomy are: accessory 
RHA, accessory or displaced CHA, both arising from the 
SMA. If we encounter hepatic arterial anomalies the possible 
options for intraoperative management are ligation, dissec￾tion and traction away from the site of dissection, division 
and anastomosis (14). There are numerous difficulties during 
surgery and postoperative complications which can occur if 
arterial anomalies are identified: i) Partial liver ischemia and 
necrosis‑the main problem with ligature of the displaced RHA 
and replaced CHA. During pancreatoduodenectomy ligation of 
the GDA should be delayed until the retropancreatic dissection 
and proper identification of the artery is complete; desirable 
is preoperative clamping of arteries which are going to be 
ligatured and post‑ligature control of the blood flow (8,14); 
ii) modification of the resection area and a risk of not achieving 
tumor‑free margins‑tough oncological compromise between 
safety of the procedure and radical removal of tumour (8); 
iii) pancreatic or biliary anastomotic leak‑postoperative 
hepatic enzymes elevation is possible (8); and iv) unexpected 
bleeding‑iatrogenic post‑ or intraoperative loss of blood (6).
In summary, we have described a two rare cases of a CHA 
originating from the SMA in combination with the topography. 
However, this anatomical variant is very rare (with frequency 
1‑3%) should be known to surgical oncologist. In our opinion 
this paper is of great value for surgeons during their training 
period as well as the experts. Multiple arterial anomalies in a 
single person are found rarely. When performing operations 
of the pancreatic region, it is necessary to have a knowledge 
of anatomy including those patterns that have been rarely

observed. The awareness of the possible extra‑ or intra‑paren￾chymal path of CHA has a huge effect on decisions connected 
with next steps of surgery, achieving tumor‑free margins, 
complications, patient's quality of life and costs of hospitaliza￾tion. Careful review of preoperative imaging especially during 
multidisciplinary meeting may prevent injury to these vascular 
structures and later complications.
