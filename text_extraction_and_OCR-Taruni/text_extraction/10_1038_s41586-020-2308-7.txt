Genetic variants that inactivate protein-coding genes are a powerful source of 
information about the phenotypic consequences of gene disruption: genes that are 
crucial for the function of an organism will be depleted of such variants in natural 
populations, whereas non-essential genes will tolerate their accumulation. However, 
predicted loss-of-function variants are enriched for annotation errors, and tend to be 
found at extremely low frequencies, so their analysis requires careful variant 
annotation and very large sample sizes1
. Here we describe the aggregation of 125,748 
exomes and 15,708 genomes from human sequencing studies into the Genome 
Aggregation Database (gnomAD). We identify 443,769 high-confidence predicted 
loss-of-function variants in this cohort after filtering for artefacts caused by 
sequencing and annotation errors. Using an improved model of human mutation 
rates, we classify human protein-coding genes along a spectrum that represents 
tolerance to inactivation, validate this classification using data from model organisms 
and engineered human cells, and show that it can be used to improve the power of 
gene discovery for both common and rare diseases.
The physiological function of most genes in the human genome remains 
unknown. In biology, as in many engineering and scientific fields, break￾ing the individual components of a complex system can provide valu￾able insight into the structure and behaviour of that system. For the 
discovery of gene function, a common approach is to introduce dis￾ruptive mutations into genes and determine their effects on cellular 
and physiological phenotypes in mutant organisms or cell lines2
. Such 
studies have yielded valuable insight into eukaryotic physiology and 
have guided the design of therapeutic agents3
. However, although 
studies in model organisms and human cell lines have been crucial in 
deciphering the function of many human genes, they remain imperfect 
proxies for human physiology.
Obvious ethical and technical constraints prevent the large-scale 
engineering of loss-of-function mutations in humans. However, recent 
exome and genome sequencing projects have revealed a surprisingly 
high burden of natural pLoF variation in the human population,

including stop-gained, essential splice, and frameshift variants1,4
, which 
can serve as natural models for inactivation of human genes. Such 
variants have already revealed much about human biology and disease 
mechanisms, through many decades of study of the genetic basis of 
severe Mendelian diseases5
, most of which are driven by disruptive vari￾ants in either the heterozygous or homozygous state. These variants 
have also proved valuable in identifying potential therapeutic targets: 
confirmed LoF variants in the PCSK9 gene have been causally linked to 
low levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol6
, and have ultimately 
led to the development of several inhibitors of PCSK9 that are now in 
clinical use for the reduction of cardiovascular disease risk. A systematic 
catalogue of pLoF variants in humans and the classification of genes 
along a spectrum of tolerance to inactivation would provide a valuable 
resource for medical genetics, identifying candidate disease-causing 
mutations, potential therapeutic targets, and windows into the normal 
function of many currently uncharacterized human genes.
Several challenges arise when assessing LoF variants at scale. LoF 
variants are on average deleterious, and are thus typically main￾tained at very low frequencies in the human population. Systematic 
genome-wide discovery of these variants requires whole-exome or 
whole-genome sequencing of very large numbers of samples. In addi￾tion, LoF variants are enriched for false positives compared with syn￾onymous or other benign variants, including mapping, genotyping 
(including somatic variation), and particularly, annotation errors1
, and 
careful filtering is required to remove such artefacts.
Population surveys of coding variation enable the evaluation of the 
strength of natural selection at a gene or region level. As natural selec￾tion purges deleterious variants from human populations, methods to 
detect selection have modelled the reduction in variation (constraint)7
or shift in the allele frequency distribution8
, compared to an expecta￾tion. For analyses of selection on coding variation, synonymous vari￾ation provides a convenient baseline, controlling for other potential 
population genetic forces that may influence the amount of variation 
as well as technical features of the local sequence. A model of constraint 
was previously applied to define a set of 3,230 genes with a high prob￾ability of intolerance to heterozygous pLoF variation (pLI)4
 and esti￾mated the selection coefficient for variants in these genes9
. However, 
the ability to comprehensively characterize the degree of selection 
against pLoF variants is particularly limited, as for small genes, the 
expected number of mutations is still very low, even for samples of up 
to 60,000 individuals4,10. Furthermore, the previous dichotomization 
of pLI, although convenient for the characterization of a set of genes, 
disguises variability in the degree of selective pressure against a given 
class of variation and overlooks more subtle levels of intolerance to 
pLoF variation. With larger sample sizes, a more accurate quantitative 
measure of selective pressure is possible.
Here, we describe the detection of pLoF variants in a cohort of 125,748 
individuals with whole-exome sequence data and 15,708 individuals 
with whole-genome sequence data, as part of the Genome Aggregation 
Database (gnomAD; https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org), the successor 
to the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC). We develop a continu￾ous measure of intolerance to pLoF variation, which places each gene 
on a spectrum of LoF intolerance. We validate this metric by comparing 
its distribution to several orthogonal indicators of constraint, includ￾ing the incidence of structural variation and the essentiality of genes 
as measured using mouse gene knockout experiments and cellular 
inactivation assays. Finally, we demonstrate that this metric improves 
the interpretation of genetic variants that influence rare disease and 
provides insight into common disease biology. These analyses provide, 
to our knowledge, the most comprehensive catalogue so far of the 
sensitivity of human genes to disruption.
In a series of accompanying manuscripts, other complementary 
analyses of this dataset are described. Using an overlapping set of 14,237 
whole genomes, the discovery and characterization of a wide variety of 
structural variants (large deletions, duplications, insertions, or other 
rearrangements of DNA) is reported11. The value of pLoF variants for 
the discovery and validation of therapeutic drug targets is explored12, 
and a case study of the use of these variants from gnomAD and other 
large reference datasets is provided to validate the safety of inhibition 
of LRRK2—a candidate therapeutic target for Parkinson’s disease13. By 
combining the gnomAD dataset with a large collection of RNA sequenc￾ing data from adult human tissues14, the value of tissue expression 
data in the interpretation of genetic variation across a range of human 
diseases is reported15. Finally, the effect of two understudied classes of 
human variation—multi-nucleotide variants16 and variants that create 
or disrupt open-reading frames in the 5′ untranslated region of human 
genes—is characterized and investigated17.
A high-quality catalogue of variation
We aggregated whole-exome sequencing data from 199,558 individuals 
and whole-genome sequencing data from 20,314 individuals. These 
data were obtained primarily from case–control studies of common 
adult-onset diseases, including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabe￾tes and psychiatric disorders. Each dataset, totalling more than 1.3 
and 1.6 petabytes of raw sequencing data, respectively, was uniformly 
processed, joint variant calling was performed on each dataset using a 
standardized BWA-Picard-GATK pipeline18, and all data processing and 
analysis was performed using Hail19. We performed stringent sample 
quality control (Extended Data Fig. 1), removing samples with lower 
sequencing quality by a variety of metrics, samples from second-degree 
or closer related individuals across both data types, samples with inad￾equate consent for the release of aggregate data, and samples from indi￾viduals known to have a severe childhood-onset disease as well as their 
first-degree relatives. The final gnomAD release contains genetic vari￾ation from 125,748 exomes and 15,708 genomes from unique unrelated 
individuals with high-quality sequence data, spanning 6 global and 8 
sub-continental ancestries (Fig. 1a, b), which we have made publicly 
available at https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org. We also provide subsets 
of the gnomAD datasets, which exclude individuals who are cases in 
case–control studies, or who are cases of a few particular disease types 
such as cancer and neurological disorders, or who are also aggregated 
in the Bravo TOPMed variant browser (https://bravo.sph.umich.edu).
Among these individuals, we discovered 17.2 million and 261.9 mil￾lion variants in the exome and genome datasets, respectively; these 
variants were filtered using a custom random forest process (Supple￾mentary Information) to 14.9 million and 229.9 million high-quality 
variants. Comparing our variant calls in two samples for which we had 
independent gold-standard variant calls, we found that our filtering 
achieves very high precision (more than 99% for single nucleotide 
variants (SNVs), over 98.5% for indels in both exomes and genomes) 
and recall (over 90% for SNVs and more than 82% for indels for both 
exomes and genomes) at the single sample level (Extended Data Fig. 2). 
In addition, we leveraged data from 4,568 and 212 trios included in 
our exome and genome call-sets, respectively, to assess the quality of 
our rare variants. We found that our model retains over 97.8% of the 
transmitted singletons (singletons in the unrelated individuals that 
are transmitted to an offspring) on chromosome 20 (which was not 
used for model training) (Extended Data Fig. 3a–d). In addition, the 
number of putative de novo calls after filtering are in line with expecta￾tions20 (Extended Data Fig. 3e–h), and our model had a recall of 97.3% for 
de novo SNVs and 98% for de novo indels based on 375 independently 
validated de novo variants in our whole-exome trios (295 SNVs and 80 
indels) (Extended Data Fig. 3i, j). Altogether, these results indicate that 
our filtering strategy produced a call-set with high precision and recall 
for both common and rare variants.
These variants reflect the expected patterns based on mutation and 
selection: we observe 84.9% of all possible consistently methylated 
CpG-to-TpG transitions that would create synonymous variants in the 
human exome (Supplementary Table 14), which indicates that at this

sample size, we are beginning to approach mutational saturation of 
this highly mutable and weakly negatively selected variant class. How￾ever, we only observe 52% of methylated CpG stop-gained variants, 
which illustrates the action of natural selection removing a substantial 
fraction of gene-disrupting variants from the population (Fig. 1c–h). 
Across all mutational contexts, only 11.5% and 3.7% of the possible syn￾onymous and stop-gained variants, respectively, are observed in the 
exome dataset, which indicates that current sample sizes remain far 
from capturing complete mutational saturation of the human exome 
(Extended Data Fig. 4).
Identifying loss-of-function variants
Some LoF variants will result in embryonic lethality in humans in a het￾erozygous state, whereas others are benign even at homozygosity, with 
a wide spectrum of effects in between. Throughout this manuscript, 
we define pLoF variants to be those that introduce a premature stop 
(stop-gained), shift-reported transcriptional frame (frameshift), or 
alter the two essential splice-site nucleotides immediately to the left 
and right of each exon (splice) found in protein-coding transcripts, and 
ascertain their presence in the cohort of 125,748 individuals with exome 
sequence data. As these variants are enriched for annotation artefacts1
, 
we developed the loss-of-function transcript effect estimator (LOFTEE) 
package, which applies stringent filtering criteria from first principles 
(such as removing terminal truncation variants, as well as rescued splice 
variants, that are predicted to escape nonsense-mediated decay) to 
pLoF variants annotated by the variant effect predictor (Extended Data 
Fig. 5a). Despite not using frequency information, we find that this 
method disproportionately removes pLoF variants that are common in 
the population, which are known to be enriched for annotation errors1
, 
while retaining rare, probable deleterious variations, as well as reported 
pathogenic variation (Fig. 2a). LOFTEE distinguishes high-confidence 
pLoF variants from annotation artefacts, and identifies a set of putative 
splice variants outside the essential splice site. The filtering strategy of 
LOFTEE is conservative in the interest of increasing specificity, filtering 
some potentially functional variants that display a frequency spectrum 
consistent with that of missense variation (Fig. 2b). Applying LOFTEE 
v1.0, we discover 443,769 high-confidence pLoF variants, of which 
413,097 fall on the canonical transcripts of 16,694 genes. The number 
of pLoF variants per individual is consistent with previous reports1
, and 
is highly dependent on the frequency filters chosen (Supplementary 
Table 17).
Aggregating across variants, we created a gene-level pLoF frequency 
metric to estimate the proportion of haplotypes that contain an inactive

copy of each gene. We find that 1,555 genes have an aggregate pLoF 
frequency of at least 0.1% across all individuals in the dataset (Extended 
Data Fig. 5c), and 3,270 genes have an aggregate pLoF frequency of at 
least 0.1% in any one population. Furthermore, we characterized the 
landscape of genic tolerance to homozygous inactivation, identifying 
4,332 pLoF variants that are homozygous in at least one individual. 
Given the rarity of true homozygous LoF variants, we expected sub￾stantial enrichment of such variants for sequencing and annotation 
errors, and we subjected this set to additional filtering and deep manual 
curation before defining a set of 1,815 genes (2,636 high-confidence 
variants) that are likely to be tolerant to biallelic inactivation (Sup￾plementary Data 7).
The LoF intolerance of human genes
Just as a preponderance of pLoF variants is useful for identifying 
LoF-tolerant genes, we can conversely characterize the intolerance of a 
gene to inactivation by identifying marked depletions of predicted LoF 
variation4,7
. Here, we present a refined mutational model, which incor￾porates methylation, base-level coverage correction, and LOFTEE (Sup￾plementary Information, Extended Data Fig. 6), to predict expected 
levels of variation under neutrality. Under this updated model, the 
variation in the number of synonymous variants observed is accurately 
captured (r = 0.979). We then applied this method to detect depletion 
of pLoF variation by comparing the number of observed pLoF variants 
against our expectation in the gnomAD exome data from 125,748 indi￾viduals—more than doubling the sample size of ExAC, the previously 
largest exome collection4
. For this dataset, we computed a median of 
17.9 expected pLoF variants per gene (Fig. 2c) and found that 72.1% of 
genes have more than 10 pLoF variants (powered to be classified into 
the most constrained genes) (Supplementary Information) expected 
on the canonical transcript (Fig. 2d), an increase from 13.2% and 62.8%, 
respectively, in ExAC.
The smaller sample size in ExAC required a transformation of the 
observed and expected values for the number of pLoF variants in each 
gene into the pLI: this metric estimates the probability that a gene 
falls into the class of LoF-haploinsufficient genes (approximately 10% 
observed/expected variation) and is ideally used as a dichotomous 
metric (producing 3,230 genes with pLI > 0.9). Here, our refined model 
and substantially increased sample size enabled us to directly assess the 
degree of intolerance to pLoF variation in each gene using the continu￾ous metric of the observed/expected ratio and to estimate a confidence 
interval around the ratio. We find that the median observed/expected 
ratio is 48%, which indicates that, as noted previously, most genes

exhibit at least moderate selection against pLoF variation, and that 
the distribution of the observed/expected ratio is not dichotomous, 
but continuous (Extended Data Fig. 7a). For downstream analyses, 
unless otherwise specified, we use the 90% upper bound of this confi￾dence interval, which we term the loss-of-function observed/expected 
upper bound fraction (LOEUF) (Extended Data Fig. 7b, c), and bin 19,197 
genes into deciles of approximately 1,920 genes each. At current sample 
sizes, this metric enables the quantitative assessment of constraint 
with a built-in confidence value, and distinguishes small genes (for 
example, those with observed = 0, expected = 2; LOEUF = 1.34) from 
large genes (for example, observed = 0, expected = 100; LOEUF = 0.03), 
while retaining the continuous properties of the direct estimate of the 
ratio (Supplementary Information). At one extreme of the distribu￾tion, we observe genes with a very strong depletion of pLoF variation 
(first LOEUF decile aggregate observed/expected approximately 6%) 
(Extended Data Fig. 7e), including genes previously characterized as 
high pLI (Extended Data Fig. 7f). By contrast, we find unconstrained 
genes that are relatively tolerant of inactivation, including many that 
contain homozygous pLoF variants (Extended Data Fig. 7g).
We note that the use of the upper bound means that LOEUF is a 
conservative metric in one direction: genes with low LOEUF scores 
are confidently depleted for pLoF variation, whereas genes with high 
LOEUF scores are a mixture of genes without depletion, and genes that 
are too small to obtain a precise estimate of the observed/expected 
ratio. In general, however, the scale of gnomAD means that gene length 
is rarely a substantive confounder for the analyses described here, 
and all downstream analyses are adjusted for the length of the coding 
sequence or filtered to genes with at least ten expected pLoFs (Sup￾plementary Information).
Validation of the LoF-intolerance score
The LOEUF metric allows us to place each gene along a continuous 
spectrum of tolerance to inactivation. We examined the correlation of 
this metric with several independent measures of genic sensitivity to 
disruption. First, we found that LOEUF is consistent with the expected 
behaviour of well-established gene sets: known haploinsufficient genes 
are strongly depleted of pLoF variation, whereas olfactory receptors are 
relatively unconstrained, and genes with a known autosomal recessive 
mechanism, for which selection against heterozygous disruptive vari￾ants tends to be present but weak9
, fall in the middle of the distribution 
(Fig. 3a). In addition, LOEUF is positively correlated with the occur￾rence of 6,735 rare autosomal deletion structural variants overlapping 
protein-coding exons identified in a subset of 6,749 individuals with 
whole-genome sequencing data in this manuscript11 (r = 0.13; P = 9.8 × 
10−68) (Fig. 3b).
This constraint metric also correlates with results in model sys￾tems: in 389 genes with orthologues that are embryonically lethal 
after heterozygous deletion in mouse21,22, we find a lower LOEUF 
score (mean = 0.488), compared with the remaining 18,808 genes 
(mean = 0.962; t-test P = 10−78) (Fig. 3c). Similarly, the 678 genes that are 
essential for human cell viability as characterized by CRISPR screens23
are also depleted for pLoF variation (mean LOEUF = 0.63) in the gen￾eral population compared to background (18,519 genes with mean 
LOEUF = 0.964; t-test P = 9 × 10−71), whereas the 777 non-essential genes 
are more likely to be unconstrained (mean LOEUF = 1.34, compared to 
remaining 18,420 genes with mean LOEUF = 0.936; t-test P = 3 × 10−92) 
(Fig. 3d).
Biological properties of constraint
We investigated the properties of genes and transcripts as a func￾tion of their tolerance to pLoF variation (LOEUF). First, we found 
that LOEUF correlates with the degree of connection of a gene in 
protein-interaction networks (r = −0.14; P = 1.7 × 10−51 after adjusting 
for gene length) (Fig. 4a) and functional characterization (Extended 
Data Fig. 8a). In addition, constrained genes are more likely to be ubiq￾uitously expressed across 38 tissues in the Genotype-Tissue Expression

expression on average (LOEUF ρ = −0.28; P < 1 × 10−100), consistent with 
previous results4
. Although most results in this study are reported at the 
gene level, we have also extended our framework to compute LOEUF 
for all protein-coding transcripts, allowing us to explore the extent of 
differential constraint of transcripts within a given gene. In cases in 
which a gene contained transcripts with varying levels of constraint, we 
found that transcripts in the first LOEUF decile were more likely to be 
expressed across tissues than others in the same gene (n = 1,740 genes), 
even when adjusted for transcript length (Fig. 4c) (constrained tran￾scripts are on average 6.34 transcripts per million higher; P = 2.2 × 10−14). 
Furthermore, we found that the most constrained transcript for each 
gene was typically the most highly expressed transcript in tissues with 
disease relevance24 (Extended Data Fig. 8c), which supports the need 
for transcript-based variant interpretation, as explored in more depth 
in an accompanying manuscript15.
Finally, we investigated potential differences in LOEUF across human 
populations, restricting to the same sample size across all populations 
to remove bias due to differential power for variant discovery. As the 
smallest population in our exome dataset (African/African American) 
has only 8,128 individuals, our ability to detect constraint against pLoF 
variants for individual genes is limited. However, for well-powered 
genes (expected pLoF ≥ 10) (Supplementary Information), we observed 
a lower mean observed/expected ratio and LOEUF across genes among 
African/African American individuals, a population with a larger effec￾tive population size, compared with other populations (Extended Data 
Fig. 8d, e), consistent with the increased efficiency of selection in popu￾lations with larger effective population sizes25,26.
Constraint informs disease aetiologies
The LOEUF metric can be applied to improve molecular diagnosis and 
advance our understanding of disease mechanisms. Disease-associated 
genes, discovered by different technologies over the course of many 
years across all categories of inheritance and effects, span the entire 
spectrum of LoF tolerance (Extended Data Fig. 9a). However, in recent 
years, high-throughput sequencing technologies have enabled the 
identification of highly deleterious variants that are de novo or only 
inherited in small families or trios, leading to the discovery of novel dis￾ease genes under extreme constraint against pLoF variation that could 
not have been identified by linkage approaches that rely on broadly 
inherited variation (Extended Data Fig. 9b). This result is consistent 
with a recent analysis that shows a post-whole-exome/whole-genome 
sequencing era enrichment for gene–disease relationships attributable 
to de novo variants27.
Rare variants, which are more likely to be deleterious, are expected 
to exhibit stronger effects on average in constrained genes (previously 
shown using pLI from ExAC28), with an effect size related to the severity 
and reproductive fitness of the phenotype. In an independent cohort 
of 5,305 individuals with intellectual disability or developmental dis￾orders and 2,179 controls, the rate of pLoF de novo variation in cases 
is 15-fold higher in genes belonging to the most constrained LOEUF 
decile, compared with controls (Fig. 5a), with a slightly increased rate 
(2.9-fold) in the second highest decile but not in others. A similar, but 
attenuated enrichment (4.4-fold in the most constrained decile) is seen 
for de novo variants in 6,430 patients with autism spectrum disorder 
(Extended Data Fig. 9c). Furthermore, in burden tests of rare variants 
(allele count across both cases and controls = 1) of patients with schizo￾phrenia28, we find a significantly higher odds ratio in constrained genes 
(Extended Data Fig. 9d).
Finally, although pLoF variants are predominantly rare, other 
more common variation in constrained genes may also be deleteri￾ous, including the effects of other coding or regulatory variants. In a 
heritability partitioning analysis of association results for 658 traits in 
the UK Biobank and other large-scale genome-wide association study 
(GWAS) efforts, we find an enrichment of common variant associations 
near genes that is linearly related to LOEUF decile across numerous 
traits (Fig. 5b). Schizophrenia and educational attainment are the most 
enriched traits (Fig. 5c), consistent with previous observations in asso￾ciations between rare pLoF variants and these phenotypes29–31. This 
enrichment persists even when accounting for gene size, expression 
in GTEx brain samples, and previously tested annotations of functional

Discussion
In this paper and accompanying publications, we present the largest, 
to our knowledge, catalogue of harmonized variant data from any 
species so far, incorporating exome or genome sequence data from 
more than 140,000 humans. The gnomAD dataset of over 270 million 
variants is publicly available (https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org), 
and has already been widely used as a resource for estimates of allele 
frequency in the context of rare disease diagnosis (for a recent review, 
see Eilbeck et al.32), improving power for disease gene discovery33–35, 
estimating genetic disease frequencies36,37, and exploring the biological 
effect of genetic variation38,39. Here, we describe the application of this 
dataset to calculate a continuous metric that describes a spectrum of 
tolerance to pLoF variation for each protein-coding gene in the human 
genome. We validate this method using known gene sets and data from 
model organisms, and explore the value of this metric for investigating 
human gene function and discovery of disease genes.
We have focused on high-confidence, high-impact pLoF variants, 
calibrating our analysis to be highly specific to compensate for the 
increased false-positive rate among deleterious variants. However, 
some additional error modes may still exist, and indeed, several recent 
experiments have proposed uncharacterized mechanisms for escape 
from nonsense-mediated mRNA decay40,41. Furthermore, such a strin￾gent approach will remove some true positives. For example, terminal 
truncations that are removed by LOFTEE may still exert a LoF mecha￾nism through the removal of crucial C-terminal domains, despite the 
escape of the gene from nonsense-mediated decay. In addition, current 
annotation tools are incapable of detecting all classes of LoF varia￾tion and typically miss, for instance, missense variants that inactivate 
specific gene functions, as well as high-impact variants in regulatory 
regions. Future work will benefit from the increasing availability of 
high-throughput experimental assays that can assess the functional 
effect of all possible coding variants in a target gene42, although scaling 
these experimental assays to all protein-coding genes represents a huge 
challenge. Identifying constraint in individual regulatory elements 
outside coding regions will be even more challenging, and require much 
larger sample sizes of whole genomes as well as improved functional 
annotation43. We discuss one class of high-impact regulatory variants in 
a companion manuscript17, but many remain to be fully characterized.
Although the gnomAD dataset is of unprecedented scale, it has 
important limitations. At this sample size, we remain far from saturating 
all possible pLoF variants in the human exome; even at the most mutable 
sites in the genome (methylated CpG dinucleotides), we observe only 
half of all possible stop-gained variants. A substantial fraction of the 
remaining variants are likely to be heterozygous lethal, whereas others 
will exhibit an intermediate selection coefficient; much larger sample 
sizes (in the millions to hundreds of millions of individuals) will be 
required for comprehensive characterization of selection against all 
individual LoF variants in the human genome. Such future studies would 
also benefit substantially from increased ancestral diversity beyond 
the European-centric sampling of many current studies, which would 
provide opportunities to observe very rare and population-specific 
variation, as well as increase power to explore population differences 
in gene constraint. In particular, current reference databases including 
gnomAD have a near-complete absence of representation from the Mid￾dle East, central and southeast Asia, Oceania, and the vast majority of 
the African continent44, and these gaps must be addressed if we are to 
fully understand the distribution and effect of human genetic variation.
It is also important to understand the practical and evolutionary 
interpretation of pLoF constraint. In particular, it should be noted that 
these metrics primarily identify genes undergoing selection against 
heterozygous variation, rather than strong constraint against homozy￾gous variation45. In addition, the power of the LOEUF metric is affected 
by gene length, with approximately 30% of the coding genes in the 
genome still insufficiently powered for detection of constraint even 
at the scale of gnomAD (Fig. 2d). Substantially larger sample sizes and 
careful analysis of individuals enriched for homozygous pLoFs (see 
below) will be useful for distinguishing these possibilities. Furthermore, 
selection is largely blind to phenotypes emerging after reproductive 
age, and thus genes with phenotypes that manifest later in life, even if

severe or fatal, may exhibit much weaker intolerance to inactivation. 
Despite these caveats, our results demonstrate that pLoF constraint 
divides protein-coding genes in a way that correlates usefully with 
their probability of disease impact and other biological properties, 
and confirm the value of constraint in prioritizing candidate genes in 
studies of both rare and common diseases.
Examples such as PCSK9 demonstrate the value of human pLoF vari￾ants for identifying and validating targets for therapeutic intervention 
across a wide range of human diseases. As discussed in more detail in an 
accompanying manuscript12, careful attention must be paid to a variety 
of complicating factors when using pLoF constraint to assess candidates. 
More valuable information comes from directly exploring the pheno￾typic effect of LoF variants on carrier humans, both through ‘forward 
genetics’ approaches such as gene mapping to identify genes that cause 
Mendelian disease, as well as ‘reverse genetics’ approaches that leverage 
large collections of sequenced humans to find and clinically characterize 
individuals with disruptive mutations in specific genes. Although clinical 
data are currently available for only a small subset of gnomAD individuals, 
future efforts that integrate sequencing and deep phenotyping of large 
biobanks will provide valuable insight into the biological implications 
of partial disruption of specific genes. This is illustrated in a companion 
manuscript that explores the clinical correlates of heterozygous pLoF 
variants in the LRRK2 gene, demonstrating that life-long partial inactiva￾tion of this gene is likely to be safe in humans13.
Such examples, and the sheer scale of pLoF discovery in this dataset, 
suggest the near-future feasibility and considerable value of a human 
‘knockout’ project—a systematic attempt to discover the phenotypic 
consequences of functionally disruptive mutations, in either the het￾erozygous or homozygous state, for all human protein-coding genes. 
Such an approach will require cohorts of samples from millions of 
sequenced and deeply, consistently phenotyped individuals and, for 
the discovery of ‘complete’ knockouts, would benefit substantially from 
the targeted inclusion of large numbers of samples from populations 
that have either experienced strong demographic bottlenecks or high 
levels of recent parental relatedness (consanguinity)12. Such a resource 
would allow the construction of a comprehensive map that directly 
links gene-disrupting variation to human biology.

Extended Data Fig. 1 | Overview of the sample quality control workflow.
a, Exome (square) and genome (circle) samples underwent quality control in 
the following stages: hard filtering (step 1), relatedness inference (step 2), 
ancestry inference (step 3), platform inference (step 4, for exomes only), and 
population- and platform-specific outlier filtering (step 5). See Supplementary 
Information for further details. Except for samples failing hard filters (dotted 
outline), all quality control analyses were applied to all samples, regardless of 
the presence or absence of other quality control flags (such as relatedness, lack 
of release permissions, or outlier status; red diagonal bar). Assignment of 
ancestry labels is represented by fill colour and accompanying three-letter 
ancestry group abbreviation. Assignment of platform labels is represented by 
outline colour and a numbered label for exomes (corresponding to imputed 
platforms) and a PCR ± label for genomes. The final set of samples included in 
the gnomAD release (125,748 exomes and 15,708 genomes) was defined to be 
the set of unrelated samples with release permissions, no hard filter flags, and 
no population- and platform-specific outlier metrics (step 6). b, In exomes, the 
chromosomal sex of samples was inferred based on the inbreeding coefficient 
on chromosome X and the coverage of chromosome Y into male (green), female 
(amber), ambiguous sex (pink), and sex chromosome aneuploid (blue). c, The 
top two principal components from PCA-HDBSCAN analysis of exome capture 
regions. Sequencing platforms were inferred for exome samples based on 
principal component analysis of biallelic variant call rates over all known 
exome capture regions, and samples were assigned a cluster label (0–15, or 
unknown) using HDBSCAN. d, We performed platform- and 
population-specific outlier filtering for several quality-control metrics. The 
distribution of the number of deletions in samples from south Asian individuals 
across platforms is shown. Distributions (and accordingly, median and median 
absolute deviations) for these metrics varied widely both by population and 
sequencing platform (numbered on the y axis). Outliers (black dots) were 
defined as samples with values outside four median absolute deviations 
(shown by dotted vertical lines) from the median of a given metric.

Extended Data Fig. 2 | Variant calling performance for common variants.
a–h, Precision-recall curves are shown for variant calls in two samples with 
independent gold-standard data, NA1287849 (a–d) and a synthetic diploid 
mixture50 (e–h). The random forest (blue) approach described here is 
compared to the current state-of-the-art GATK variant quality score 
recalibration (orange) for exome SNVs (a, e) and indels (b, f), and genome SNVs 
(c, g) and indels (d, h). Note that the indels presented in f and h exclude 
1-base-pair (bp) indels as they are not well characterized in the synthetic diploid 
mixture gold standard sample. In all cases, at the thresholds chosen (dashed 
lines representing 10% and 20% of SNVs and indels filtered, respectively), 
random forest outperforms or is similar to variant quality score recalibration.

Extended Data Fig. 3 | Variant calling performance for rare variants.
a–j, The x axes show the cumulative ranked percentile for our random forest 
(blue) model and, as a comparison, for the current state-of-the-art GATK 
variant quality score recalibration (orange). That is, the point at 10 shows the 
performance of the 10% best-scored data; the point at 50 shows the 
performance 50% best-scored data. a–d, The number of transmitted singletons 
(singletons in the unrelated individuals that are transmitted to an offspring) on 
chromosome 20 for exome SNVs (a) and indels (b), and genome SNVs (c) and 
indels (d). Chromosome 20 was not used for training our random forest model. 
We expect most of these to be real variants because we observe Mendelian 
transmission of an allele that was sequenced independently in a parent and 
child. e–h, The number of bi-allelic de novo calls per child (4,568 exomes, 212 
genomes) outside of low-complexity regions. The expectation is that there is 
approximately 1.6 de novo SNV (e) and 0.1 de novo indels per exome (f), and 65 
de novo SNVs (g) and 5 de novo indels (h) per genome20. i, j, The number of 
independently validated de novo mutations, available for a subset of 331 exome 
samples for which de novo mutations were validated as part of other studies51. 
In all cases, at the thresholds chosen (dashed lines representing 10% and 20% of 
SNVs and indels filtered, respectively), random forest outperforms or is similar 
to variant quality score recalibration.

Extended Data Fig. 4 | Variant discovery at large sample sizes. a, b, The total 
number of variants observed (a) and the proportion of possible variants 
observed (b) as a function of sample size, broken down by variant class. At large 
sample sizes, CpG transitions become saturated, as previously described4
. 
Colours are consistent in a and b. c, This results in a decrease of the transition/
transversion (Ti/Tv) ratio. d, When broken down by functional class, we 
observe the effects of selection, in which synonymous variants have the 
highest proportion observed, followed by missense and pLoF variants. e, f, The 
number of additional pLoF variants introduced into the cohort as a function of 
sample size on a log (e) and linear (f) scale. Here, gnomAD (black) refers to a 
uniform sampling from the population distribution of the full cohort of 
exome-sequenced individuals.

Extended Data Fig. 5 | Using LOFTEE to create a high-confidence set of pLoF 
variation. a, Schematic of LOFTEE filters. LOFTEE filters out putative 
stop-gained, essential splice, and frameshift variants based on sequence and 
transcript context, as well as flagging exonic features such as conservation (not 
shown). For instance, variants that are not predicted to disrupt splicing based 
on retention of a strong splice site, or rescue of a nearby splice site. Additional 
filters not shown include: ANC_ALLELE (the alternative allele is the ancestral 
allele), NON_ACCEPTOR_DISRUPTING and DONOR_RESCUE (opposite to those 
already shown). b, To tune the END_TRUNC filter, we retained variants that pass 
the 50-bp rule (are more than 50 bp before the 3′-most splice site). The overall 
MAPS score for variants that fail this rule is shown in grey. For the remaining 
39,072 variants, we computed the sum of the genomic evolutionary rate 
profiling (GERP) score of bases deleted by the variant. At 40 bins of this score, 
we compute the MAPS score for those variants retained at this threshold (red) 
compared to variants removed at this threshold (blue), and plot this as a 
function of the proportion of variants filtered at this threshold. We chose the 
50% point as it retains variants with a MAPS score of 0.14, while removing 
variants with a MAPS score of 0.06. Error bars represent 95% confidence 
intervals. c, Density plot of aggregate pLoF frequency computed from 
high-confidence pLoF variants discovered using LOFTEE.

Extended Data Fig. 6 | Computing the depletion of variation of functional 
categories. a, The distribution of mean methylation values across 37 tissues 
and across every CpG dinucleotide in the genome. We divided the genome into 
3 levels (low methylation, missing or < 0.2; medium, 0.2–0.6; and high, >0.6) 
and computed all ensuing metrics based on these categories. b, Comparison of 
estimates of the mutation rate with previous estimates52. For transversions and 
non-CpG transitions, we observe a strong correlation (linear regression 
r = 0.98; P = 2.6 × 10−65). For CpG transitions, the new estimates are calculated 
separately for the three levels of methylation and track with these levels. 
Colours and shapes are consistent in b–d. c, For c–e, only synonymous variants 
are considered. The proportion of possible variants observed for each context 
is correlated with the mutation rate. We compute two fit lines, one for CpG 
transitions, and one for other contexts to calibrate our estimates. 
d, Calibration of each context to compute a predicted proportion observed 
after fitting the two models in c, which is used to calculate an expected number 
of variants at high coverage. e, With an expectation computed from high 
coverage regions, the observed/expected ratio follows a logarithmic trend 
with the median coverage below 40×, which is used to correct low coverage 
bases in the final expectation model. f–h, For each transcript, the observed 
number of variants is plotted against the expected number from the model 
described above, for synonymous (f), missense (g), and pLoF (h) variants, and 
the linear regression coefficient is shown. Note that the expectation does not 
include selection, and so, pLoF and, to a lesser extent, missense variants exhibit 
lower observed values than expected.

Extended Data Fig. 7 | Genomic properties of constrained genes.
a, b, Histogram of the observed/expected ratio of pLoF variation (a) and LOEUF 
(b). Most genes have fewer observed variants than expected (median observed/
expected = 0.48), and the genes with no observed pLoFs are distinguished 
between confidently constrained genes and noise by LOEUF. c, A 2D density 
plot of the number of observed versus expected pLoF variants. The boundaries 
of each decile are plotted as gradients (that is, the most constrained decile is 
below the lowest red line). d, The LOEUF of a gene is correlated with its coding 
sequence length (beta = −1.07 × 10−4
; P < 10−100): thus, for all downstream 
statistical tests, we adjust for gene length or remove genes with fewer than 10 
expected pLoFs. e, Observed/expected ratios of various functional classes 
across genes within each LOEUF decile. The most constrained decile has 
approximately 6% of the expected pLoFs, while synonymous variants are not 
depleted and missense variants exhibit modest depletion. f, The percentage of 
each LOEUF decile that was described in ExAC as constrained, or pLI > 0.94
. 
g, The percentage of each LOEUF decile that have at least one homozygous 
pLoF variant. h, Box plots of the aggregate pLoF frequency for each LOEUF 
decile. Centre line denotes the median; box limits denote upper and lower 
quartiles; whiskers denote 1.5× the interquartile range; points denote outliers). 
In e–g, error bars represent 95% confidence intervals (note that in some cases 
these are fully contained within the plotted point).

Extended Data Fig. 8 | Biological properties of constrained genes. a, The 
percentage of genes in each functional category from Pharos 
(see Supplementary Information) is broken down by the LOEUF decile. b, The 
mean number of tissues in which a transcript is expressed, binned by 
transcript-based LOEUF decile, is shown for all transcripts and canonical 
transcripts. c, The percentage of genes in which the most expressed transcript 
is also the most constrained is plotted in red, which is enriched compared to a 
permuted set (blue). d, For 927 genes with expected pLoF ≥10 in both the 
African/African American and European population subsets (n = 8,128), the 
LOEUF scores are highly correlated (linear regression r = 0.78, P < 10−100), with a 
lower mean score observed in the African/African American population (0.49 
versus 0.62; two-sided t-test P = 4.1 × 10−14), which has a higher effective 
population size. e, The mean LOEUF score for 865 genes with expected pLoF 
≥ 10 in all populations (n = 8,128). Error bars represent 95% confidence 
intervals.

Extended Data Fig. 9 | Applications of constraint metrics to rare variant 
analysis of disease. a, Proportion of each LOEUF decile found in OMIM. 
b, Proportion of disease-associated genes discovered by whole-exome/
genome sequencing (WES/WGS) compared to conventional (typically 
linkage) methods, plotted by LOEUF decile. The former are more constrained 
(LOEUF 0.674 versus 0.806, two-sided t-test P = 1.2 × 10−16), which suggests that 
these techniques are more effective for picking up genes with a de novo 
mechanism of disease, compared to recessive genes identified by linkage 
methods. c, Similar to Fig. 5a, the rate ratio is defined by the rate of de novo 
variants (number per patient) in autism cases divided by the rate in controls. 
pLoF variants in the most constrained decile of the genome are approximately 
fourfold more likely to be found in cases compared to controls. d, The mean 
odds ratio of a logistic regression of schizophrenia28 is plotted for each LOEUF 
decile. Error bars in a–d correspond to 95% confidence intervals.

Extended Data Fig. 10 | Applications of constraint metrics to common 
variant analysis of disease. a, The ˆτ⁎
 coefficient (see Supplementary 
Information) for each LOEUF decile across 276 independent traits. Unlike the 
enrichment measure reported in Fig. 5, ˆτ⁎
is adjusted for 74 baseline genomics 
annotations. Positive values of ˆτ⁎
 indicate greater per-SNP heritability than 
would be expected based on the other annotations in the baseline model, 
whereas negative values indicate depleted per-SNP heritability compared to 
that baseline expectation. b, Enrichment coefficient for each LOEUF decile 
using different window sizes to define which SNPs to include upstream and 
downstream of each gene. c, Enrichment coefficient for each LOEUF decile 
across traits after controlling for brain expression and gene size. Results are 
consistent with those shown in Fig. 5, which indicates that brain gene 
expression and gene size do not fully explain the enrichment of heritability 
observed in constrained genes. Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals.

Sample size This study was opportunistic, and involved secondary use of all available genome and exome data. No sample size was predetermined. 
Nevertheless, the current sample size enables the accurate assessment of constraint against pLoF variation for over 72% of genes in the 
human genome (see Figure 2).
Data exclusions Sample QC and variant QC for gnomAD are described extensively in the supplementary methods. Notably, individuals with severe pediatric 
disease, and known first disease relatives of those with severe pediatric disease were excluded, as previously established and described [Lek 
et al., 2016]. 
Replication We did not attempt to reproduce any findings in a separate dataset, as no other data set of comparable size exists.
Randomization As this was a population-based study, and not a case-control study, no randomization was performed. 
Blinding As this was a population-based study, and not a case-control study, blinding was not relevant.
