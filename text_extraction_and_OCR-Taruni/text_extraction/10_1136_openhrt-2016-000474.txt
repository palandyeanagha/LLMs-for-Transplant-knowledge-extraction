ABSTRACT
Objective: Mutations in the LMNA gene encoding
lamins A and C of the nuclear lamina are a frequent
cause of cardiomyopathy accounting for 5–8% of
familial dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Our aim was to
study disease onset, presentation and progression
among LMNA mutation carriers.
Methods: Clinical follow-up data from 27 LMNA
mutation carriers and 78 patients with idiopathic DCM
without an LMNA mutation were collected. In addition,
ECG data were collected and analysed systematically
from 20 healthy controls.
Results: Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed no difference
in event-free survival (death, heart transplant,
resuscitation and appropriate implantable cardioverter￾defibrillator therapy included as events) between LMNA
mutation carriers and DCM controls ( p=0.5). LMNA
mutation carriers presented with atrial fibrillation at a
younger age than the DCM controls (47 vs 57 years,
p=0.003). Male LMNA mutation carriers presented with
clinical manifestations roughly a decade earlier than
females. In close follow-up non-sustained ventricular
tachycardia was detected in 78% of LMNA mutation
carriers. ECG signs of septal remodelling were present
in 81% of the LMNA mutation carriers, 21% of the
DCM controls and none of the healthy controls giving
a high sensitivity and specificity for the standard ECG
in distinguishing LMNA mutation carriers from patients
with DCM and healthy controls.
Conclusions: Male LMNA mutation carriers present
clinical manifestations at a younger age than females.
ECG septal remodelling appears to distinguish LMNA
mutation carriers from healthy controls and patients
with DCM without LMNA mutations.
INTRODUCTION
LMNA mutations are prevalent in familial
dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), accounting
for about 5–8% of the cases.1 The typical
early manifestations of LMNA mutations are
ECG abnormalities including flat P wave,
atrioventricular block, supraventricular and
ventricular arrhythmias.2 3 LMNA mutations
pose a risk for sudden cardiac death, and
consequently implantable cardioverter￾defibrillator (ICD) implantation has been
suggested as primary prophylaxis for all
LMNA mutation carriers, or after further risk
assessment.4 5 Cardiolaminopathy often
follows an age-dependent disease progression
in which the ECG and rhythm abnormalities
tend to precede structural heart disease and
systolic impairment, which in turn often does
not fulfil the echocardiography criteria for
DCM due to milder dilation of the left
KEY QUESTIONS
What is already known about this subject?
▸ Although ventricular dilation and dysfunction
may remain less severe than in other forms of
dilated cardiomyopathy, the penetrance of cardi￾olaminopathy mutations is almost complete
often resulting in serious arrhythmias or heart
failure. Cardiomyopathy-causing LMNA muta￾tions often present with typical ECG abnormal￾ities, such as atrioventricular block and atrial or
ventricular arrhythmias.
What does this study add?
▸ We report that most LMNA mutation carriers
present with non-sustained ventricular tachycar￾dia (NSVT) in close follow-up. In addition, we
reaffirm that male LMNA mutation carriers have
an earlier disease onset than females. We
suggest that LMNA mutation carriers likely
benefit from close follow-up. We also present a
new ECG entity, septal remodelling, present in
most LMNA mutation carriers and suggesting
that the pathological process leading to cardiola￾minopathy typically affects the myocardial
septum.
How might this impact on clinical practice?
▸ The detection of septal remodelling in standard
ECG should lead to an echocardiogram and
thorough enquiry of cardiac family history.
▸ Even asymptomatic LMNA mutation carriers
need follow-up to detect atrial fibrillation and
NSVTs.

ventricle or dilation with preserved ejection fraction.3 6
Lately LMNA mutations have also been linked to familial
forms of mainly right ventricular disease manifestations
resembling arrhythmogenic right ventricular
cardiomyopathy.7 8
Structural heart disease can result in general, non￾localising ECG changes, such as left ventricular hyper￾trophy (LVH), ST depression, widening of the QRS
complex, and P terminal force.9 10 On the other hand,
ECG changes in leads overlying affected regions can
reflect regional disease processes. For instance, narrow
and deep q waves are typical for localised wall thickening
in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.11
Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) in cardiac MRI
(CMR) is considered an effective tool in showing myo￾cardial scarring.12 In LMNA mutation carriers LGE has
been mainly seen in the basal or mid-ventricular septum
suggesting a possible localised disease process.13 14
The aim of this study was to assess disease presenta￾tion, progression and clinical outcome in symptomatic
and asymptomatic LMNA mutation carriers.
METHODS
Patients and controls
This longitudinal retrospective study included all identified
adult LMNA mutation carriers from Helsinki and Kuopio
University Hospitals willing to participate in a follow-up
study. Twenty-seven LMNA mutation carriers were recruited
to the study between 1999 and 2010. The mutation car￾riers, each harbouring one of five LMNA mutations
((NM_170707.3 (LMNA), c427T>C, p.(Ser143Pro) in
exon 2; c.394G>C, p.(Ala132Pro) in exon 2; c.568C>T,
p.(Arg190Trp) in exon 3; c. 1493delG, p.(Ala499Leufs*49)
in exon 9; c. 1085delT, p.(Leu363Trpfs*117) in exon 6)
were either probands or their family members from nine
families identified in two previous studies.15 16 Clinical
follow-up data from the LMNA mutation carriers and DCM
controls were collected up to 31 December 2014. Control
patients (n=78) with idiopathic DCM were collected from a
patient database retrospectively. Probands with DCM, diag￾nosed and recruited before 2010 were included as DCM
controls; patients recruited after possible heart transplant￾ation, were excluded to minimise possible collection bias.
Only probands who have been tested for cardiomyopathy￾causing mutations using OsSeq, a next-generation￾sequencing method, as described before were included to
ensure that there were no LMNA mutation carriers among
the DCM controls.17
Concerning the ECG abnormalities, the study patients
were also compared with an available cohort of 20 (7
men, 13 women) healthy controls.
General
The criteria used for the diagnosis of DCM were Left
ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD)>27 mm/m2
and Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)<45%.15
Clinical end point data were collected from all available
hospital records. First incidences of atrial fibrillation,
non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), resuscita￾tion or appropriate ICD therapy, cardiogenic embolism
and pacemaker/ICD implantations were recorded.
NSVT was defined as more than three consecutive ven￾tricular beats in 24-hour Holter or clinical exercise test.
To avoid bias, NSVTs were not recorded in the DCM
controls due to the less vigorous follow-up of the DCM
control group compared with the LMNA mutation
carrier group. Owing to the small number of major clin￾ical events in the LMNA mutation carrier group, a com￾posite end point of resuscitation, appropriate ICD
therapy, death and heart transplant was used. In LMNA
mutation carriers with available CMR data, the presence
of the ECG parameter septal remodelling was compared
with CMR findings from a previous article;13 the CMR
methods were presented earlier.
The study patients gave written informed consent. The
study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the
Helsinki University Central Hospital (Decision number:
Dnro 322/E5/03, Research permit number: T1010K0019).
ECG analyses
One standard 12-lead ECG recorded by 50 mm/s speed of
each LMNA mutation carrier, DCM control and healthy
control was analysed in a systematic manner manually by
one investigator (KN) blinded to the clinical data. The
ECG recording was from the time of study recruitment.
The age at the time of ECG recording was 42 years for all
LMNA mutation carriers; 49 years for those with DCM
(LMNA-DCM subgroup), and 37 years for those without.
The following definitions were used in the ECG analyses:
first-degree atrioventricular block was defined as PR inter￾val >200 ms,18 P terminal force as negative portion of
the P wave in lead V1≥0.4 mm/s,19 flat P wave as P-wave
amplitude <1 mm in lead II, and broad P wave as ≥120 ms
in lead II20 LVH was defined according to the
Sokolow-Lyon criteria,21 or Cornell voltage duration
product (QRS-duration (ms)×(RaVL in mm+SV3 in mm
with 6 mm added for women) ≥2440),22 23 for ST segment
depression we used ≥0.5 mm if the pattern was horizontal
or descending, and ≥1 mm if ascending in ≥2 adjacent
leads measured at the J point+60 ms,24 for T-wave inversion
≥1 mm in ≥2 adjacent leads, except for leads aVR and V1
was used.25 For fragmented QRS in ≥2 adjacent leads we
used the definitions by Das et al.
26 Septal fragmentation
was considered present if there was QRS fragmentation in
≥2 septal leads (V1–V3). Non-specific intraventricular con￾duction defect was defined as QRS duration ≥120 ms not
fulfilling criteria for right or left bundle branch block.
Owing to the high proportion of implanted pacemakers,
we used anamnestic data of AV block in addition to the
findings in the ECG used for analysis.
In addition to the established ECG changes, we intro￾duced a novel ECG parameter, ‘septal remodelling’,
which we define as one of the following present in V1–
V3: (1) pathological Q waves in ≥2 parallel leads, or (2)
septal fragmentation as defined above, (3) poor R-wave

progression (R wave <3 mm) in leads V1–V3 accompan￾ied by QRS fragmentation, or disorderly distributed
R-wave amplitudes, either RV2>RV3 or RV1>RV2. The
possibility of lead switch was considered by assessing the
morphology of the P and S waves in the precordial
leads, and no suspicious cases were observed.27 Any Q
wave ≥40 ms in duration, or ≥3 mm deep, or qR-ratio
≥0.25, in ≥2 parallel leads except lead aVR was consid￾ered pathological.28
Statistical methods
Continuous variables were analysed using Student’s
t-test. The normality of continuous variables was assessed
using the Shapiro-Wilk test for normality. In the few
instances, where the variables were not normally distrib￾uted Mann-Whitney U test was used. For categorical vari￾ables, the χ2 test was used when the expected count of
80% or more of the cells was ≥5. Otherwise the Fisher’s
exact test was used. All statistical tests were two-sided
with a 5% level of significance, and no adjustments were
made for multiplicity. However, concerning the ECG
analyses the number of paired-wise comparisons (LMNA
vs DCM and LMNA vs healthy control) was accounted
for by multiplying the p values obtained by 2. The
Kaplan-Meier analysis was used for survival analysis. SPSS
V.22 was used for statistical analyses.
RESULTS
General
The frequencies and incidence ages of clinical manifes￾tations are reported in table 1. The mean age at
previous follow-up or major end point was 48 years for
LMNA mutation carriers and 59 years for the DCM con￾trols (p<0.001). Twelve LMNA mutation carriers ful￾filled the criteria for DCM. Pacemakers were more
common in the LMNA-DCM subgroup than in the
DCM control group (83% vs 47%, p=0.047). NSVT was
very common among the LMNA mutation carriers
(78%). Heart transplants were more frequent in the
LMNA-DCM subgroup than in the DCM control group
(25% vs 11%), but the difference was not statistically
significant. Atrial fibrillation was also more common
among LMNA mutation carriers than in the DCM con￾trols; p=0.007 when comparing the LMNA-DCM sub￾group to the DCM control group. LMNA mutation
carriers had their first episode of atrial fibrillation at a
younger age than the DCM controls (47 vs 57 years,
p=0.003). All the cases of likely cardiogenic thrombo￾embolic events among the LMNA mutation carriers
occurred among the LMNA-DCM subgroup. The fre￾quency of thromboembolic events in the LMNA-DCM
subgroup was roughly twice as high as in the DCM
control group, but the difference was not statistically
significant.
There were less major end points in the entire
LMNA carrier group, and more in the LMNA-DCM
subgroup than in the DCM control group. However,
looking at major end points including deaths, heart
transplantations and resuscitations, Kaplan-Meier ana￾lysis (figure 1A) revealed no difference in event-free
survival between LMNA mutation carriers and DCM
controls. When pacemakers were included in survival
analysis, a statistically significant difference was seen;

among the DCM controls were truncating titin gene
mutations, which explained 18% of cases.
Differences between men and women
The frequencies and incidence ages of clinical manifes￾tations in male and female LMNA mutation carrier and
DCM control subgroups are presented in table 2. Male
LMNA mutation carriers presented with clinical manifes￾tations at an earlier age than female LMNA mutation
carriers. This difference is illustrated in figure 2. There
was a trend for a higher incidence of atrial fibrillation
among the male LMNA mutation carriers compared
with the women. Men presented with atrial fibrillation at
an earlier age than female LMNA mutation carriers (41
vs 54 years, p=0.016). They also received pacemakers
and ICDs at a younger age than females (42 vs 59 years
for any pacemakers, p=0.001, 42 vs 63 for ICDs,
p<0.001). In addition, they developed DCM at a younger
age than women (42 vs 54 years, p=0.042). The vast
majority of male and female LMNA mutation carriers
had recorded NSVT episodes. Although there was no
gender difference in the frequencies of NSVTs, men
appeared to have the first recorded episode roughly
10 years earlier than women (41 vs 50 years, NS).
ECG
The ECG characteristics of the LMNA mutation carriers,
DCM controls and healthy controls are presented in
table 3. The novel ECG pattern, septal remodelling
proved to be very frequent (81%) in LMNA mutation
carriers, while this ECG pattern was present in only 21%
of DCM controls and in none of the healthy controls.
The differences were even more striking when combin￾ing the ECG parameters flat P wave and AV block to
septal remodelling in the analyses. The sensitivities, spe￾cificities, and positive and negative predictive values for
septal remodelling in classifying LMNA mutation carriers
from the two control groups are given in table 4.
Figure 3 shows ECGs with varying forms of septal remod￾elling together with CMR images of an LMNA mutation
carrier presenting LGE in the septum. We had available
CMR data from 17 of the 27 LMNA mutation carriers. In
76% of the cases (n=13), septal remodelling in the ECG
and septal LGE in CMR were concordantly present. In
the remaining four cases, either septal remodelling in
ECG (n=2) or LGE in CMR (n=2) was present.
There were no mutation-specific ECG findings in
this study when comparing all the five mutations, or the
Finnish founder mutation Ser143Pro (n=15) to the
other four mutations as one group (n=12).
DISCUSSION
Our data suggest a difference in the age of disease onset
in cardiolaminopathy between men and women; men
presented roughly a decade earlier than women regard￾ing all studied clinical manifestations. Concerning the
age of first incidence of atrial fibrillation, age of
pacemaker or ICD implantation, and age at DCM diag￾nosis, the difference was statistically significant. Also in a
previous study of LMNA mutation carriers, the frequen￾cies of malignant ventricular arrhythmias, end-stage
heart failure and mortality were higher in men than in
women, but the age of the first cardiac involvement was
similar in both genders.29 We suggest that the disease
onset in LMNA mutation carriers in general takes place
earlier in men than in women.
The incidence of ventricular arrhythmias is known to
be high in LMNA mutation carriers with prevalence
numbers over 50% cited in several studies.14 30 The
prevalence of 78% (for NSVT) in this study is even
higher, which may be explained by repeated documenta￾tions of Holter ECGs and clinical exercise testing of the
same individuals over several years. This finding suggests
that even if ventricular arrhythmias have not been
detected in an individual LMNA mutation carrier, they
likely will be in regular follow-up. Some years ago, it was
even suggested that ICDs should be implanted prophy￾lactically to all LMNA mutation carriers.4 Recently, a risk

ventricular arrhythmias.5 We agree with the proposed
strategy for individual risk stratification among LMNA
mutation carriers when considering the need for an
ICD. However, the high prevalence of NSVT highlights
the need for close follow-up of these patients, as the clin￾ical presentation is likely to progress. It can also be
speculated that close follow-up and timely interventions
could reduce the risk of events, or slow down disease
progression. Our results suggest a similar or lower inci￾dence of major clinical end points, including heart
transplantations, resuscitations or deaths, in LMNA
mutation carriers than in DCM controls. The incidence
of major end points was higher in the older DCM
control group, but Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a
similar event-free survival rate in the LMNA mutation
carrier and the DCM control groups.
We introduce a novel ECG concept, septal remodel￾ling, as a readily available clinical tool to assess cardiac
involvement in LMNA mutation carriers. In our study of
27 LMNA mutation carriers of varying ages, 81% pre￾sented with this ECG finding compared with 21% of the
DCM controls and none of the healthy controls. When
combining this abnormality with the previously
described ECG signs associated with laminopathy, flat P
waves and AV block, all but one of the LMNA mutation
carriers had at least one of these abnormalities.
ST segment depression, markers of increased left ven￾tricular mass (LVH and broad QRS), and elevated filling
pressure (P terminal force) are established ECG signs of
structural heart disease.9 10 ECG changes associated with
regional disease processes, mainly fibrosis or necrosis, are
less well established. We suggest that septal remodelling
in the ECG leads V1–V3 represents a localised disease
process typical to cardiolaminopathy. Our hypothesis is
compatible with the fact that CMR studies using LGE as a
marker for cardiac fibrosis suggest disease localisation in
the basal and mid-ventricular septum and the basal left
ventricular wall in LMNA mutations.13 14 In this study in
76% (13/17) of the LMNA mutation carriers with avail￾able CMR data, septal remodelling in the ECG and LGE
in the septum were concordant. ECG septal remodelling
was very common in LMNA mutation carriers, quite rare
in DCM controls and absent in healthy controls.
However, it seems logical that any regional disease
process, such as myocardial infarction or myocarditis,
resulting in necrosis or fibrosis, would be reflected in a
similar way on the 12-lead ECG. Therefore, we propose
further clinical assessment, including family history and
cardiac imaging to rule out structural heart disease, in
individuals without a history of cardiac disease, who
present with septal remodelling in their 12-lead ECG.
Genetic testing may also be appropriate, taking into
account the entire clinical presentation.
Owing to the explorative nature of this study, multipli￾city correction was not performed.
In conclusion, our results suggest that male LMNA
mutation carriers appear to present with cardiolamino￾pathy manifestations roughly a decade earlier than

women. The high incidence of atrial fibrillation and ven￾tricular arrhythmias in LMNA mutation carriers supports
close follow-up to enable timely initiation of medical
and device-based antiarrhythmic therapy.
Finally, we introduce a novel ECG parameter, septal
remodelling, which was frequently observed in LMNA
mutation carriers and seemed to differentiate these indi￾viduals from patients with other forms of DCM.
Limitations
The number of LMNA mutation carriers in this study
was rather small. It is possible that some non-significant
statistical comparisons could have reached statistical sig￾nificance in a larger patient material. Our definition of
ECG septal remodelling is not based on exact experi￾mental or CMR-based correlations between regional
disease processes and electrophysiological changes.
However, it represents a collection of previously pub￾lished ECG parameters of localised heart disease.
