Background: Previous research suggests Kyolic-aged-garlic-extract to be effective in
reducing blood pressure in a large proportion of hypertensive patients similar to first-line
standard antihypertensive medication. High blood pressure has been linked to gut
dysbiosis, with a significant decrease in microbial richness and diversity in hypertensives
compared to normotensives. Furthermore, gut dysbiosis has been associated with
increased inflammatory status and risk of cardiovascular events.
Objective: To assess the effect of Kyolic aged GARlic extract on Gut microbiota,
Inflammation, and Cardiovascular markers, including blood pressure, pulse wave velocity
and arterial stiffness.
Methods: A total of 49 participants with uncontrolled hypertension completed a
double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial of 12-weeks, investigating the effect
of daily intake of aged-garlic-extract (1.2 g containing 1.2 mg S-allylcysteine) or placebo
on blood pressure, pulse wave velocity and arterial stiffness, inflammatory markers, and
gut microbiota.
Results: Mean blood pressure was significantly reduced by 10 ± 3.6 mmHg systolic
and 5.4 ± 2.3 mmHg diastolic compared to placebo. Vitamin B12 status played a role in
responsiveness to garlic on blood pressure in 17% of patients. Garlic significantly lowered
central blood pressure, pulse pressure and arterial stiffness (p < 0.05). Trends observed in
inflammatory markers TNF-α and IL-6 need to be confirmed in larger trials. Furthermore,
aged-garlic-extract improved gut microbiota, evident by higher microbial richness and
diversity with a marked increase in Lactobacillus and Clostridia species after 3 months
of supplementation.
Conclusions: Kyolic-aged-garlic-extract is effective in reducing blood pressure in
patients with uncontrolled hypertension, and has the potential to improve arterial

stiffness, inflammation, and gut microbial profile. Aged-garlic-extract is highly tolerable
with a high safety profile as a stand-alone or adjunctive antihypertensive treatment, with
multiple benefits for cardiovascular health.

INTRODUCTION
Our previous research suggests that Kyolic aged garlic extract
is effective in reducing blood pressure in a large proportion
(70–80%) of hypertensive patients similar to first-line standard
antihypertensive medication (1–3), and has shown promise
in reducing central blood pressure, arterial stiffness, and
inflammation (3–6). A meta-analysis on the effect of garlic on
blood pressure including 20 trials and more than 900 participants
revealed a significant effect of garlic on blood pressure, with an
average decrease in systolic blood pressure of 8.6 mm systolic and
6.1 mm diastolic in hypertensives (n = 14 trial arms, n = 468
participants) (4).
Kyolic aged garlic extract has also been shown to be effective in
reducing central hemodynamic measures including central blood
pressure, pulse wave velocity, pulse pressure, and arterial stiffness,
which are regarded as more important predictors than peripheral
blood pressure for cardiovascular disease (7, 8). Arterial stiffness,
an indicator of the flexibility of the arteries, increases with age
through loss of intact elastin and collagen fibers in the arterial
wall, which also contributes to increased blood pressure (9).
Stiffening of the arteries is a normal process of aging (10, 11),
however, changes are subtle and are generally not noticeable.
However, previous research has shown Kyolic aged garlic extract
to be effective in reducing arterial stiffness, which in turn is
related to better heart health and aerobic fitness, while the risk
of cardiovascular disease is reduced (3, 8).
Previously we described the mechanism of action by which
garlic influences blood pressure, involving two main signaling
pathways via nitric oxide (NO) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S)
production (12). Garlic, a sulfur donor, provides an important
component for the trans-sulfuration pathway, which involves
methylation and requires several co-factors such as vitamin B12,
folate and vitamin B6. In addition, known genetic variants for
the CBS (cystathionine-β-synthase) and CSE (cystathionine-γ￾lyase) enzymes, influence the efficiency of H2S production, and
play an important role in the susceptibility for hypertension
together with deficiencies in co-factors, in particular vitamin B6.
We previously identified a potentially large proportion (80%)
of healthy adults in Australia with sub-optimal vitamin B12
levels (<500 pg/l) (13). Therefore, deficiencies in co-factors,
such as vitamin B12, which may serve as a proxy marker for
underlying deficiencies in other B-vitamins, could be important
contributors to hypertension in these individuals, which may also
explain individual responsiveness to garlic supplementation seen
in clinical trials.
Furthermore, high blood pressure has been linked to gut
microbiota dysbiosis, both in animal and human studies with a
significant decrease in microbial richness (Chao richness/relative
abundance) and diversity (Shannon diversity = proportion of
species/total number of species) and a significant increase in
the Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratio (F/B ratio) in hypertensives
compared to normotensives (14). In this small study including
n = 10 normotensives and n = 7 hypertensive individuals,
hypertensives had a significantly lower microbial richness and
Shannon diversity (p < 0.05) compared to normotensives.
In general, higher relative abundance/bacterial mass/microbial
richness and diversity of microbial species is associated with
better health (14–16).
In addition, high Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratios have
been associated with obesity in mice and humans (17). Also, The
Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio was significantly higher in
hypertensive rats compared to control rats [F/B ratio=22.51 vs.
4.29; p < 0.001] (14). Natural changes in F/B ratios have been
described with increasing age, the mean F/B ratio in 25–45 year
old adults was higher than in the elderly of 70–90 years (n = 21
vs. 20: F/B ratio 12.5 vs. 2.5) (18).
Moreover, gut dysbiosis has been associated with increased
inflammatory status, chronic inflammatory diseases and
increased risk of cardiovascular events (19). Biochemical
markers for inflammation are cytokines, which usually appear
in a “cascading” system, and can take on pro- and or anti￾inflammatory properties, with the balance between these
cytokines, or cytokine ratios, determining the inflammatory
response (20). The ratios between pro- and anti-inflammatory
cytokines, such as IL-6 and IL-10 have been linked to long term
outcome of acute coronary syndrome (21). Garlic has been
found to increase IL-10 and inhibit TNF-α and IL-6 production
in placental cell culture (22), and TNF-α in inflammatory bowel
disease (23). Similarly, Kyolic aged garlic extract was found to
significantly reduce the inflammatory marker TNF-alpha in
hypertensive patients (3). High ratios of IL-6/ TNF-α were found
relevant in the modulation of both innate and adaptive immune
responses in newborns (24), and play a role in the etiology of a
number of autoimmune diseases (25).
With garlic’s prebiotic properties, and source of intracellular
hydrogen sulfide (H2S) (12, 26), garlic has the potential to
modulate the gut microbiota (27), and to protect from intestinal

inflammation and to restore microbiota biofilm and mucus
production (28). The timeframe of gut microbiota composition
to change with dietary supplementation is relatively short, as
shown in a 4 week study of IBS patients taking daily probiotics
(29). In addition, probiotics consumption significantly reduced
blood pressure, in particular in trials of longer than 8 weeks
duration (meta-analysis of 9 RCTs involving 534 patients) (30).
Our 3-month randomized controlled double-blind trial (RCT)
aimed to assess the effect of Kyolic aged GARlic extract on
Gut microbiota, Inflammation, and Cardiovascular markers,
including blood pressure, pulse wave velocity and arterial
stiffness.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Trial Design and Participants
Adults with uncontrolled hypertension [systolic BP (SBP) ≥
140 mmHg and/or diastolic BP (DBP) ≥ 90 mmHg] were
sought to participate in the double-blind randomized placebo￾controlled parallel 12-week trial investigating the effect of aged
garlic extract on blood pressure, central haemodynamic measures
including pulse wave velocity, inflammatory markers, and the
gut microbiome. Participants were eligible, if they were on an
established plan of blood pressure medication for at least 2
months, or were not taking any blood pressure medication, and
their doctor was not planning to change current treatment during
the trial. We excluded adults with unstable medical conditions
or serious illness, at the discretion of the GP, pregnancy, severe
hypertension (mean sitting SBP ≥ 180 mm Hg and DBP ≥
110 mm Hg), those planning surgery in the next 3–4 months,
or with a history of intestinal surgery, inflammatory bowel
disease, celiac disease, lactose intolerance, chronic pancreatitis,
or diagnosed malabsorption disorder. Additionally, participants
were not enrolled, if they had been on antibiotic treatment
within the last 2 months of study enrolment, taking prescribed
anti-inflammatory agents, glucocorticoids, or other immune
regulating prescription medication. Potential participants were
advised to cease any probiotics or garlic supplementation at least
2 months prior to trial enrolment.
We recruited through the NIIM clinic newsletter, NIIM
website, and flyers distributed in the local area in Melbourne.
The study was approved by the NHMRC-endorsed NIIM Human
Research Ethics Committee, and participants provided written
informed consent.
Allocation and Trial Supplements
Consenting eligible patients were randomly allocated to the
garlic or placebo group using a computer-generated permuted
random number table provided by an independent researcher not
involved in patient recruitment, patient care, data collection, and
follow-up.
Patients were assigned either two capsules daily of Kyolic aged
garlic extract (Reserve formula; Wakunaga of America Co Ltd
(31) containing 1.2 g of aged garlic extract powder and 1.2 mg
S-allylcysteine (32), or to two placebo capsules containing inert
microcrystalline cellulose daily for 12 weeks.
Kyolic aged garlic extract powder is manufactured from
organically grown garlic bulbs, which have undergone a 20-
month natural aging process at room temperature. During
the aging process volatile sulfur-components found in raw
garlic, such as allicin, are chemically converted into stable
and standardisable components, including the main vaso-active
component S-allylcysteine (SAC), associated with its blood
pressure reducing properties (31–33). Garlic bulbs and Kyolic
garlic extract powder, also contain insoluble dietary fiber, also
known as prebiotics, acting as “food” for the good bacteria in the
gut.
Placebo capsules were matched in appearance to the
active capsules, and packaged in identical containers by the
manufacturers off-site. Activated carbon-sachets were added to
each container to disguise any odor. Patients, investigators and
research assistants were blinded to treatment allocation. Blinding
success of patients was assessed at the end of the trial by
questionnaire.
Patients’ appointments were made at NIIM 4-weekly for blood
pressure and cardiovascular measurements. Eligible participants
were required to fast (6–8 h) for blood testing at baseline and 12
weeks. A collection kit was provided for stool microbial analysis
at baseline and 12 weeks.
Participants were instructed to start the trial capsules after
blood and stool collection at baseline, and to continue until
the day of stool collection at 12 weeks. Patients were given a
4-week supply of trial capsules at the baseline, 4 and 8 weeks
appointments.
Participants were advised to take the trial capsules in
the evening with food to minimize belching. Participants
were reminded to take their usual prescription medication as
instructed by their doctor, and not to alter their general diet and
exercise regimen throughout the trial. Compliance was assessed
by questionnaire and by pill count at the end of each visit.
Assessments
Baseline Demographics and Tolerability
The baseline questionnaire assessed patient’s demographics,
BP and other medications, supplements, family history of
cardiovascular and chronic diseases. Tolerability of trial capsules
was assessed at each 4-weekly appointment using our previously
developed questionnaire (1, 2). The 12-week questionnaire
audited medication, and assessed acceptability of trial capsules
and blinding success.
Clinical Blood Pressure Monitoring
Primary outcome measures were SBP and DBP at 4, 8, and
12 weeks compared with baseline. BP was measured by a
trained research assistant using two independent devices, (a)
a calibrated and validated digital sphygmomanometer (Omron
HEM-907, JA-Davey-Pty-Ltd, Melbourne, Australia), and, (b)
an oscillometric ambulatory BP monitor (Mobil-O-Graph, IEM￾GmbH, Germany), with appropriate sized brachial cuffs.
The displays of the sphygmomanometers was positioned away
from the patient to assure blinding to the BP readings. BP
measurement was taken with the patient in seated position with
the arm supported at heart level, after 5 min rest, after abstinence
Frontiers in Nutrition | www.frontiersin.org 3 December 2018 | Volume 5 | Article 122

Ried et al. Garlic and Heart Gut Health
from food, nutritional supplements, caffeinated beverages, and
smoking for a minimum of 2 h prior to BP measurement at
Approximately the same time/day of the week, as per standard
BP measurement guidelines (34). BP was recorded as three serial
measurements at intervals of 30 s. The mean of the three BP
measurements was used in the analysis. If a BP reading deviated
by more than 10 mm Hg from the average reading, the BP reading
on that arm was repeated.
Central Hemodynamic Measures, Arterial Stiffness
With the Mobil-O-Graph device we also assessed central
hemodynamic measures, including central blood pressure, pulse￾wave-velocity (PWV), pulse pressure, and arterial stiffness at
baseline, 4, 8, and 12 weeks. The Mobil-O-Graph, used in
our previous trial (3), is a brachial non-invasive device which
takes a 10 s snapshot of the radial arterial pressure wave and
derives the ascending aortic pressure wave, providing central
cardiovascular measurements. Here PWV is indirectly derived
by a computerized algorithm calculated from the brachial pulse.
PWV data is provided in m/s and age-and-gender-adjusted-PWV
is compared to the reference population in percent (%) (10, 11).
As PWV, a measure for arterial stiffness and a strong predictor
of cardiovascular morbidity, is more accurately measured directly
by the assessment of the distance traveled over time from carotid
to femoral artery 7, we also used the validated SphygmoCor Xcel
(device Atcor Medical, AUS) for PWV. Here, the patient is in
a supine position, and the distance from the carotid to femoral
pulse is measured, and the time for the pulse wave to travel from
carotid to femoral artery is assessed by applanation tonometry.
Blood Tests
The research assistant, trained in phlebotomy, took a fasted
blood sample at baseline and 12 weeks to assess the red blood
cell active Vitamin B12 and inflammatory markers TNF-α and
interleukin-6 (IL-6).
Stool Test/Gut Microbiota
Enrolled patients were provided with a commercially available
test kit from Genova Diagnostics, USA (www.gtx.net) at baseline
and at 12 weeks, and were instructed to collect a stool sample
within a few days of their baseline appointment and to send
this to Genova Diagnostics for a Microbial Ecological Profile
(GI-Effects-Stool-Profile), providing a validated comprehensive
profile of commensal bacterial species in colony-forming-units
(CFU)/g stool by multiplex PCR-DNA analysis. The report was
used to calculate Relative Abundance (RA)/ microbial richness,
Shannon diversity, and Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio.
Statistical Analysis
Primary outcome measures were blood pressure change
over time (SBP/DBP) at 12 weeks compared to baseline, and
secondary outcome measures were central hemodynamic
measures, including pulse wave velocity, changes in gut
microbiota measured by relative abundance/ microbial richness,
microbial diversity, and Firmicute/Bacteroidetes ratio, and
changes in inflammatory markers TNF-α and IL-6.
Vitamin B12 blood levels were explored as potential
confounding variables.

Ried et al. Garlic and Heart Gut Health
Analyses were performed using IBM SPSS version 24.
Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.
Descriptive analysis was carried out for baseline variables.
Normality of data distribution was assessed by the Shapiro–
Wilks test. Differences between the groups at 12 weeks compared
to baseline were assessed by chi-square test for binominal
variables, and by one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni adjustment
for continuous and normally distributed variables. Potential
confounding variables were included in the analysis using
ANCOVA (analysis of co-variance), e.g., baseline blood pressure,
or age and gender were relevant for central hemodynamic
measures, e.g., pulse wave velocity. Primary analysis was
conducted with all participants following protocol, excluding
data points owing to BP medication change. Subgroup analyses
of changes in SBP/DBP overtime by BP medication at baseline
were also undertaken.
We compared Vitamin B12 levels to BP change between
groups by scatterplots. As previously described, we defined
responders to garlic as mean BP reduction by more than 3%
in SBP (≥5 mm Hg) or DBP (≥3 mm Hg) over time compared
to baseline, which is clinically and statistically meaningful and
similar to the definitions by others (3, 35).
Changes in cytokines TNF-α and IL-6 levels were analyzed
by ANOVA excluding high values/outliers due to infection (e.g.,
common cold), and by subgroups (≥50 and <50% percentile).
Cytokine ratios IL-6/ TNF- α were also calculated.

Microbial Analysis
Microbial Ecological Stool Profile was done by validated
multiplex PCR by Genova Diagnostics, USA (www.gtx.net).
Results were presented as colony-forming-units (CFU) per gram
of stool of 21 bacterial species, grouped into four main phyla:
Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria
phyla.
We calculated Relative Abundance (RA), microbial richness,
or “total” bacterial mass as the sum of all analyzed bacteria
groups in colony forming units per gram (CFU/g), calculated
changes over time (12 weeks vs. baseline) by bacterial group,
and compared statistical significant differences between groups
by ANOVA.
Diversity of species, Shannon diversity was calculated as the
sum of the number of individual species relative to the total
number of bacteria using the formula: H = SUM[(pi)∗
ln(pi)]
with SUM = Summation, and pi= number CFU/g in individual
bacterial group/sum of all bac in CFU/g. Changes over time
between the groups were assessed by ANOVA.
Correlations between BP change and gut microbiota change
were analyzed by the non-parametric Spearman correlation.
Sample Size
A sample size of 50 patients was calculated based on the following
assumptions: To detect a difference of 8 mmHg BP (SD = 9) in
BP change between the active treatment (n = 25) and control
(n = 25) with 80% power and 95% confidence (3, 4); to account
for 10% drop-out or non-attendance at all appointments.
FIGURE 2 | Blood pressure changes over time by group: (A) systolic blood
pressure (SBP) and (B) diastolic blood pressure (DBP).
RESULTS
Participants
The trial was conducted in Melbourne, Australia between May
2016 and October 2017. Patients were recruited through the
NIIM clinic’s doctors, the NIIM newsletter and website, and
letterbox drop of flyers.
A total of 57 patients were screened for eligibility, 52 patients
were enrolled in the trial and randomly allocated to the garlic
or the placebo group. Three patients withdrew due to illness
unrelated to the trial, with a total of 49 patients completing the
trial in Dec 2016. Full data analysis was available for all outcome
measures by October 2017, with some missing data due to a
variety of reasons outlined in Figure 1.
Baseline characteristics included age, gender, BMI, smoking
habits, family history of cardiovascular diseases, Vitamin B12,
SBP and DBP, and blood pressure medication. All but baseline
SBP (p = 0.05) were not significantly different between the groups
(Table 1). Potential confounding factors, including baseline SBP,
were accounted for in the analyses.
Participants, males/females (45/55%), were of 62 ± 10 years of
age with a high average BMI of 29 ± 7 kg/m2
. Family history of
cardiovascular events was reported by 60% of the participants.
Two-thirds of participants took standard blood pressure
medication (63%), most took only one type (59%), with
angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors (ACEI) being the
most often prescribed type (47%). Of those participants all
but one (n = 1) did not change their blood pressure regimen
throughout the trial. About half of the participants took other
prescription medications, and did not change these over the
period of the trial (Table 1). None of the participants reported
a substantial change in diet or exercise regimen throughout the
trial period.
Blood Pressure and Central Hemodynamic
Measures
Our sample was a homogenous group of people with
uncontrolled hypertension and of similar age. Testing for
normality of data distribution by Shapiro–Wilk test confirmed
normal distribution of SBP, DBP and hemodynamic markers
(PWV, MAP, PP, cSBP, cDBP, cPP), in the garlic and the placebo
groups.
Analysis of all participants (n = 49) revealed a reduction in
SBP over 12 weeks within the garlic group (−14.3 ± 13.9 mmHg)
compared to placebo (−4.3 ± 11.4 mmHg), resulting in a mean
difference SBPchange (SE) of −10.0 ± 3.6 mmHg between the
groups with high statistical significance (p = 0.008).
Diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was reduced on average by
9.9 ± 6.8 mmHg within the garlic group compared to 4.4 ±
8.9 mmHg in the placebo group, providing a mean difference
DBPchange (SE) of −5.4 ± 2.3 mmHg with statistical significance
(p = 0.02) (Figure 2).
The trajectory of blood pressure change over time within
both groups is in line with the findings in previous trials (1–3),
whereby blood pressure dropped slightly from baseline in the
placebo group due to reduced whitecoat effect and familiarization
with the trial staff and environment (36–38), but did not decrease
Frontiers in Nutrition | www.frontiersin.org 6 December 2018 | Volume 5 | Article 122

Ried et al. Garlic and Heart Gut Health
to the same extent as in the garlic group, resulting in a statistically
significant mean BP difference between the groups.
Subgroup analysis of participants taking standard BP
medication (n = 16/17) revealed a slightly greater reduction in
SBP of 12.3 ± 4.7 mmHg compared with participants not on BP
medication (n = 7/9) of 4.9 ± 5.4 mmHg (p = 0.014) (Table 2).
However, the small number in the subgroup of participants
not taking standard BP medication limited interpretability of
findings.
A number of central hemodynamic measures changed
significantly over time between groups, including cSBP (central
systolic blood pressure; MeanDiff (SE): −12.5 (4.6) mmHg,
p = 0.01), PP (pulse pressure; MeanDiff (SE): −9.6 (3.4) mmHg,
p = 0.008), cPP (central pulse pressure; MeanDiff (SE): −6.5
(3.0) mmHg, p = 0.04), MAP (mean arterial pressure; MeanDiff
(SE):−7.9 (4), p = 0.05), and age-and gender-adjusted pulse wave
velocity [PWVmobile_adj =MeanDiff (SE): −7.7 (4) %, p = 0.046],
an indicator for arterial stiffness. PWV measured in m/s with
both devices (PWVmobilo and PWVsphyg) but not adjusted for
age and gender tended to improve in the garlic group compared
to placebo albeit not statistically significant. In summary, Kyolic
aged garlic extract significantly lowered central blood pressure,
pulse pressure and adjusted pulse wave velocity, an indicator for
arterial stiffness (Table 2).
Vitamin B12
Vitamin B12 is one of the important co-factors in the mechanism
of action for blood pressure reduction amongst other B-complex

adults in Australia below the optimal levels of Vitamin B12 (13),
we explored whether a low Vitamin B12 level may be involved in
the responsiveness to garlic in hypertensives.
In this study, there were 4 out of 23 (17%) non-responders in
the garlic group (SBP change < 5 mmHg), and all had lower Vit
B12 levels with n=1 below the standard reference range of 200

increase of Lactobacillus (Firm6) bacteria and Clostridia species
(Firm3) in the garlic group, while Faecalibacterium prausnitzii
(Firm5) markedly increased in the placebo group. All marked
observed changes were in the Firmicutes phylum albeit not
statistically significant between the groups (Figure 4, Table S1).
Microbial Diversity
There was a small but statistically insignificant shift in microbial
diversity with an increase in diversity in the garlic group, while
there was a small decrease in diversity in the placebo group over
time (Figure 5).

Ried et al. Garlic and Heart Gut Health
Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes Ratio
Comparison of the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes Ratio between the
groups revealed a small decrease in the garlic group and a small
increase in the placebo group over time (Table 3). Subgroup
analysis of those with a high (≥14) or low F/B ratio (<14) at
baseline revealed a trend in the garlic group improving more than
the placebo group in the high F/B subgroup toward a lower F/B
ratio (garlic: mean ± SD = −6.8 ± 19.8 vs. placebo: mean ±
SD = −0.4 ± 12.1).
Correlations Blood Pressure–Microbiota
To assess whether there were any statistically significant
correlations between changes in blood pressure and microbiota,
we used Spearman correlation.
No significant correlations were obtained between BP and
observed microbiotic changes within the groups. However, the
observed changes in the Firmicutes phylum in the garlic group
with an increase in numbers in Clostridia and Lactobacillus
species and a decrease in F. prausnitzii, were significantly
correlated (Lactobacillus and Clostridia: r = 0.561, p = 0.01); and
Clostridia and F. prausnitzii: r = 0.639, p = 0.02).

Observed microbiotic changes in the placebo group followed
an inverse direction compared to the garlic group, while F.
prausnitzii increased, the Clostridia and Lactobacillus species
decreased over time, with a significant correlation between
Clostridia decrease and F. prausnitzii increase (r = 0.619,
p = 0.01).
Inflammatory Markers/Cytokines
Cytokines TNF-α and IL-6 were investigated. After excluding
outliers, e.g., high values in participants presenting with an
acute infection (common cold), we observed a trend toward a
greater decrease in inflammatory marker TNF-α over time in the
garlic group compared to the placebo group, albeit statistically
not significant (Table 4). In contrast, a greater decrease but
not statistically significant decrease in IL-6 was observed in the
placebo group.
As each cytokine influences levels of other cytokines, and
IL-6 has been shown to inhibit TNF-α (40), we also calculated
the TNF-α/IL6 ratio. A smaller ratio was observed in the garlic
group (TNF-α/IL6 = 9.22 ± 8.4) compared to placebo (TNF￾α/IL6 = 35.1 ± 19.5), which can be regarded as a beneficial trend
(Table 4).
In subsequent subgroup analyses we compared groups with
high or low levels of inflammatory markers at baseline.
For TNF-α we divided into two even subgroups (∼50%
percentile), low <200 fg/ml and those above 200 fg/ml. A greater
reduction in the subgroup with high TNF-α levels was observed
in the garlic group compared to placebo, albeit not statistically
significant [mean diff (SE) = −95.8 (71) fg/ml, p = 0.2] (Table 4).
For IL-6 we divided participants into two even subgroups (∼50%
percentile), high levels ≥ 1,000 fg/ml, and low < 1,000 fg/ml. In
the subgroup with high IL-6 levels, there was a greater reduction
of IL-6 in the placebo group, albeit not statistically significant
(Table 4).
Tolerability, Acceptability, and Blinding
All participants tolerated the trial capsules well, and found it
very easy/easy and very acceptable/acceptable to take the capsules
(garlic: 87.5/12.5%; placebo: 92/8%). No participants experienced
any adverse effects, and only few mentioned garlic taste and
burping in the first week of the trial (n = 5), but no participant
found this bothersome.

DISCUSSION
Our trial suggests Kyolic aged garlic extract to be effective
in reducing blood pressure in patients with uncontrolled
hypertension, in line with our previous trials (1–3). A dosage
of two capsules daily containing 1.2 g of aged garlic extract
containing 1.2 mg of the vaso-active S-allylcysteine (SAC)
significantly lowered SBP by 10 mmHg compared to placebo
over 12 weeks (p = 0.008), DBP by 5.4 mmHg (p = 0.02) in
a group of 50–70 year olds, and was highly tolerated. Subgroup
analysis of participants taking standard BP medication revealed
a slightly greater reduction in SBP by 12.3 mmHg (n = 33,
68% of participants), while the low sample size in the subgroup
of participants not taking standard BP medications limited
interpretability.
The average blood pressure reduction by Kyolic aged garlic
extract alone or in combination with other blood pressure
medications, is comparable to conventional standard blood
pressure drug therapies, reducing the risk of cardiovascular
disease such heart attack or stroke by 30–40% (41).
In this trial, 83% of the participants responded to garlic with a
SBP reduction of more than 5 mmHg, a slightly larger proportion
than previously found (70%) (3).
To explore potential underlying factors of individual
responsiveness to garlic supplementation, we tested for vitamin
B12 levels in this trial. Vitamin B12 is one of the important
co-factors implicated in the methylation and H2S signaling
pathway by which garlic reduces blood pressure, and may
serve as a proxy marker for other underlying deficiencies
in vitamin B6, vitamin B2, and folate, also essential co￾factors in H2S production (12, 42). Vitamin B12 deficiency
can lead to elevated homocysteine, a marker for endothelial
dysfunction and a risk factor for cardiovascular disease,
due to impaired re-methylation. Elevated homocysteine
may subsequently be shunted into the trans-sulfuration
pathway at an increased rate, which in turn requires vitamin
B6 for CBS- and CSE-enzyme dependent H2S production
(12, 42).
While all non-responders (17%) in this trial were below the
optimal level of Vit B12 (<500 pg/ml), none of the responders
were below the standard level (<200 pg/ml), but a proportion
of BP responders (40%) were between standard and optimal
levels (200–500 pg/ml) of VitB12, indicating a non-exclusive
involvement of vitamin B12 in the BP reducing mechanism.
While vitamin B12 may play a role in the responsiveness
to garlic on blood pressure, other factors, such as vitamin
B6 and folate, as well as genetic factors, such as the trans￾sulfuration gene cystathione-β-synthase (CBS) are also important
in the biochemical mechanism (12), but were not assessed
in this trial. Here, we speculate that the non-responders may
have been deficient in multiple B-vitamins, including vitamin
B12, while responders including those with lower non-optimal
Frontiers in Nutrition | www.frontiersin.org 11 December 2018 | Volume 5 | Article 122

Ried et al. Garlic and Heart Gut Health
vitamin B12 levels may have had sufficient vitamin B6 levels
needed for enzymatic conversion of garlic’s sulfur compounds to
H2S.
In this trial, a number of central hemodynamic measures,
including central systolic blood pressure and pulse wave velocity,
a primary indicator for arterial stiffness, were significantly
lowered by aged garlic extract.
Central hemodynamic measures are regarded as more
important predictors than peripheral blood pressure for
cardiovascular disease (7). Our findings are in line with previous
trials showing a beneficial effect of aged garlic extract on pulse
wave velocity and endothelial function (3, 8), and provide new
evidence that aged garlic extract has the potential to reduce
central blood pressure and arterial stiffness in individuals with
uncontrolled hypertension. As arterial stiffness increases with
age by an average of 1.43 m/s PWV in 10 years (10, 11), our
findings suggest Kyolic to have the potential to reverse the
aging of arteries and therefore arterial stiffness by about 5 years
evident by a mean reduction of PWV by 0.7 m/s within 3
months.
Additionally, elevated levels of inflammatory markers TNF￾α and TNF-α/IL-6 ratio tended to decrease more in the garlic
group, in line with previous trials (3, 6). Trends observed in
inflammatory markers TNF-α and IL-6 need to be confirmed in
larger trials.
Furthermore, comprehensive microbial stool analysis revealed
an increase in microbial richness, microbial diversity, and a
trend toward a healthier Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratio in the
garlic group compared to placebo. Specifically, we observed a
marked shift of bacterial species in the Firmicutes phylum in
the garlic group compared to placebo. While aged garlic extract
influenced the increase in Lactobacillus and Clostridia species,
the observed shift in the placebo group was evident by an increase
in F. prausnitzii to the detriment of Lactobacillus and Clostridia
species.
Lactobacillus bacteria, increased by the prebiotic aged garlic
extract, are generally regarded as beneficial (43), while common
Clostridia species colonization in the gut have been found to
activate innate immune genes in intestinal epithelial cells, and
to prevent sensitization to food allergens in mice (44, 45). In
the placebo group the observed marked increase in F. prausnitzii
might have been influenced by the fiber-rich cellulose in the
placebo capsules. Cellulose, generally regarded as inert, may have
been food for growth for bacterial species thriving on dietary
fiber, such as the Firmicute Butyrivibria crossus (46, 47).
Our study was adequately powered for and participants had
been selected on the primary outcome measures, SBP and
DBP, allowing also for exploration by subgroups, and providing
sufficient data for analysis of central hemodynamic measures
such as central blood pressure, and pulse wave velocity, a marker
for arterial stiffness.
However, assessments of the effect of aged garlic extract
on most secondary outcome measures, including inflammatory
markers, Vitamin B12 levels, and gut microbiota was exploratory,
and statistical analysis was limited by smaller numbers in the
subgroups of participants with high or low levels of these markers
at baseline.
In addition, longer trials may be needed to provide statistical
evidence of a potential correlation between blood pressure and
gut microbiota, as a previous small human study suggested
demonstrating a significant difference in microbial richness and
diversity between hypertensives and normotensives 15. In our
trial all participants were hypertensives, and a period of 3
months may not be sufficient to achieve a statistically significant
microbial change representative of a long-term normotensive
environment.
CONCLUSIONS
In summary, our trial consolidated current evidence for Kyolic
aged garlic extract to be effective in reducing blood pressure in
individuals with uncontrolled hypertension similarly to standard
blood pressure medication. Kyolic aged garlic extract is highly
tolerable, and can be taken safely in addition to other standard
blood pressure medication. Our trial provided new evidence
for Kyolic garlic to improve central hemodynamic measures
and arterial stiffness, regarded as important predictors for
cardiovascular disease.
Our trial is the first to explore the effect of Kyolic
aged garlic extract on gut microbiota in hypertensives, with
promising results toward an increase in microbial richness and
diversity, and a marked increase in the beneficial and immune
stimulating bacteria, Lactobacillus and Clostridia species, within
a 3-month period. Together with the potential lowering of
inflammation, Kyolic garlic provides beneficial effects on several
levels important for cardiovascular health.
Further larger and longer-term studies are warranted to assess
the potential of Kyolic aged garlic extract on gut microbiota,
inflammation and immunity. Moreover, it would be of interest
to explore individuals’ responsiveness to aged garlic extract,
by investigating underlying dietary and genetic factors such as
vitamin B6, folate levels, in addition to vitamin B12.
