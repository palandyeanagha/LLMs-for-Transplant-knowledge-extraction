Rapamycin, an inhibitor of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), has the strongest experimental support to 
date as a potential anti-aging therapeutic in mammals. Unlike many other compounds that have been claimed to 
influence longevity, rapamycin has been repeatedly tested in long-lived, genetically heterogeneous mice, in which 
it extends both mean and maximum life spans. However, the mechanism that accounts for these effects is far from 
clear, and a growing list of side effects make it doubtful that rapamycin would ultimately be beneficial in humans. 
This Review discusses the prospects for developing newer, safer anti-aging therapies based on analogs of rapamycin 
(termed rapalogs) or other approaches targeting mTOR signaling.
A brief history of rapamycin and mechanistic 
target of rapamycin
Rapamycin was discovered in the soil of Easter Island as a com￾pound produced by Streptomyces hygroscopicus that was capable of 
inhibiting the proliferation of the yeast Candida albicans but did not 
affect the growth of bacteria (1). In mammals, rapamycin was found 
to inhibit the immune response and was subsequently adopted as a 
standard therapy to prevent graft rejection in transplant recipients 
and to treat autoimmune disorders (2, 3). Rapamycin also broadly 
inhibits the growth and proliferation of mammalian cells, spurring 
more recent interest in its use as a cancer therapy (4).
Mechanistically, rapamycin binds FKBP12, an immunophilin 
with prolyl isomerase activity. Two additional proteins required 
for its effects in yeast were identified in a genetic screen in 1991 
and termed target of rapamycin 1 (TOR1) and TOR2 (5). During 
1994 and 1995, three separate groups isolated a 289-kDa kinase 
that is bound and inhibited by the rapamycin-FKBP12 complex in 
mammalian cells (6–8). This kinase is now known as the mecha￾nistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and is approximately 40% 
homologous to Saccharomyces cerevisiae TOR proteins and highly 
conserved among eukaryotes.
mTOR is found in two complexes that have distinct functions 
and different sensitivities to the action of rapamycin. mTOR 
complex 1 (mTORC1; consisting of mTOR, raptor, mLST8/GβL, 
PRAS40, DEPTOR) plays a key role in the regulation of translation 
and cell growth via phosphorylation of substrates that include S6 
kinase (S6K) and eukaryotic initiation factor eIF4E binding pro￾tein (4E-BP), and is potently inhibited by rapamycin. In contrast, 
mTORC2 (consisting of mTOR, rictor, mLST8/GβL, mSIN1, pro￾tor, DEPTOR) regulates a diverse set of substrates, including AKT 
S473, serum/glucocorticoid regulated kinase, and PKC-α, and 
is acutely resistant to rapamycin, although it can become physi￾cally disrupted during chronic exposure. mTORCs receive inputs 
through a wide variety of signaling mechanisms and have roles in 
many aspects of physiology, which have been reviewed in depth (9). 
Briefly, mTORC1 responds to signals that include amino acids, 
glucose, WNT ligands, oxygen, cAMP, and insulin/IGF-1. The reg￾ulation of mTORC2 activity is less clear but may involve interac￾tion with ribosomes (10). Insulin/IGF-1 signaling to mTORC1 is 
mediated in part by mTORC2 via AKT phosphorylation. In turn, 
mTORC1 activation feeds back to attenuate insulin/IGF-1 signal￾ing via S6K1 and GRB10 (Figure 1 and ref. 11).
Connecting mTOR signaling to aging
A role for TOR signaling in aging was first revealed in 2003, 
when Vellai and colleagues showed that RNAi against let-363/
CeTor significantly extended the life span of Caenorhabditis ele￾gans and functioned independently from daf-16, a FOXO homo￾log that had previously been shown to influence life span (12). 
This was rapidly followed by the demonstration that genetic 
inhibition of TOR signaling extends life span in Drosophila 
melanogaster and the budding yeast S. cerevisiae (13, 14). Genetic 
inhibition of mTOR signaling in mammals is a delicate matter, 
as the mTOR protein kinase, raptor, rictor, and mLST8 are all 
essential for development (15). Recently, we demonstrated that 
female Mtor+/–Mlst8+/– mice have reduced mTORC1 activity and 
increased longevity, similar to the phenotype reported by Sel￾man and colleagues for mice that lack S6K1, one of the princi￾pal substrates of mTORC1 (16, 17). Therefore, the link between 
mTOR signaling and longevity appears to be conserved from 
yeast to mammals (Table 1).
Effects of rapamycin on longevity
Rapamycin extends life span in yeast, worms, and flies (Table 2 
and refs. 18–21). In 2009, rapamycin was shown to extend both 
mean and maximum life spans of male and female genetically 
heterogeneous mice (offspring of a four-way cross between long￾lived, inbred strains) (22). Remarkably, the treatment was not ini￾tiated until the mice had reached an advanced age (20 months), 
roughly equivalent to a human age of 60 years. In a follow-up 
study beginning at 9 months of age, rapamycin extended medi￾an life span in males and females by 10% and 18%, respectively, 
and maximum life span by 16% and 13% (23). Rapamycin was 
microencapsulated in an enteric coating that enabled delivery in 
the food during these studies, and the blood level achieved was 
approximately three-fold higher than the typical therapeutic 
range for immunosuppression in humans (24).
Conflict of interest: The authors have declared that no conflict of interest exists.

Other studies have also found a positive effect of rapamycin on 
life span. Chen et al. found that rapamycin decreased mortality 
rate in aged male C57BL/6 mice (25). Anisimov et al. showed that 
rapamycin extends the maximum life span (mean life span of the 
last 10% surviving) in a short-lived, tumor-prone strain of mice 
(FVB/N HER-2/neu transgenic) (26). While this study provides 
strong evidence that rapamycin can be beneficial in the setting of 
cancer, the choice of strain makes it hard to separate anticancer 
effects from aging per se. However, rapamycin also extends life 
span in 129/Sv mice, an inbred strain with a more typical life span 
and tumor incidence (27). Impressively, 22.9% of the treated mice 
remained alive at the death of the last control animal.
Taken together, these observations make rapamycin the best￾supported candidate for a mammalian longevity drug. Under￾standing its mechanism of action has the potential to offer insight 
into the nature of the underlying aging process and may lead to 
new therapeutic approaches to alleviate the burden of age-related 
diseases. However, the mechanism accounting for the anti-aging 
effects of rapamycin is not yet clear (Table 2).
Potential mechanisms of life span extension 
by rapamycin
Anticancer effects. Cancer is the most common cause of death for 
laboratory mice, and rapamycin is an anticancer drug. Therefore, it 
remains possible that life span extension by rapamycin is second￾ary to tumor suppression and unrelated to the underlying aging 
process. There are several reasons why we do not favor this model. 
First, the initial experiments linking rapamycin and mTOR inhi￾bition to longevity were performed in organisms that are mainly 
postmitotic (worms and flies) or single celled (yeast) and therefore 
do not experience cancer. Second, rapamycin increases maximum 
longevity, providing support for the idea that it slows multiple 
age-related pathologies. Targeting a single disease should not sub￾stantially increase the life spans of the longest-lived individuals 
in a group, as the oldest individuals will be at very high risk for 
most or all causes of death unless the underlying aging process has 
been postponed. Third, rapamycin has been shown to delay mul￾tiple age-related changes in mice, including loss of stem cell func￾tion (25), cognitive decline (28), retinopathy (29), accumulation 
of subcellular alterations in the myocardium, liver degeneration, 
endometrial hyperplasia, tendon stiffening, and decline in physical 
activity (30). Moreover, rapamycin is therapeutic in rodent mod￾els of cardiac hypertrophy (31, 32) and neurodegenerative diseases 
(33–35), conditions that affect aging humans. While cancer pre￾vention clearly plays a major role in the survival benefit conferred 
by rapamycin, it is important to understand that cancer is an age￾related disease, and its prevention is an expected consequence of 
any therapy that slows aging.
Translation. mTORC1, via S6K and 4E-BP, plays a central role in 
the regulation of translation, and it is worth considering wheth￾er reduced protein synthesis per se might mediate the effects of 
rapamycin on longevity. For example, decreasing the overall rate 
of translation might allow better fidelity during synthesis and/or 
relieve stress on the mechanisms that degrade erroneous, misfolded, 
Figure 1
mTOR signaling. mTOR is found in two complexes, mTORC1 and 
mTORC2. mTORC1 is regulated in part via the TSC complex, which 
normally act as a GTPase-activating protein for Rheb to suppress 
mTORC1 signaling. mTORC1 is also regulated by amino acids via 
the Ras-related GTP binding (Rag) family of small GTPases. The Rag 
proteins activate mTORC1 by localizing mTORC1 to the lysosome via 
interaction with the ragulator complex (110). mTORC1 promotes growth 
by enhancing ribosomal biogenesis, translation, and other anabolic 
processes, while inhibiting autophagy. mTORC1 suppresses insulin/
IGF-1 signaling via direct regulation of Grb10 and S6K, which subse￾quently reduces signaling to mTORC2. AKT, an inhibitor of TSC1/2, 
is one of several direct substrates of mTORC2. Processes that are 
upregulated by mTOR signaling are shown in red; those that are down￾regulated by mTOR signaling are shown in blue.

or damaged proteins (36). Indeed, experiments in S. cerevisiae, C. ele￾gans, and D. melanogaster have demonstrated that deletion or siRNA￾mediated knockdown of ribosomal subunits, S6K, or translation 
initiation factors results in increased life span and S6K1 deletion 
extends life span in female mice, whereas 4E-BP deletion blocks the 
life-extending effects of caloric restriction (CR) in flies (13, 37–40).
Recent findings challenge the view that translation per se is the 
key to the benefits of TOR/mTOR inhibition. While female mice 
lacking S6K1 have extended life spans, there is no discernible effect 
on overall translation, at least in skeletal muscle (41). In addition, 
the long life spans of worms that lack a key translation initiation 
factor can still be further increased by TOR deletion, implying that 
distinct mechanisms are at play (38). Moreover, life span extension 
due to deletion of translation initiation factors is dependent on 
daf-16, whereas life span extension by depletion of TOR, S6K, or 
ribosomal subunits is not, again pointing to the involvement of 
multiple distinct mechanisms (12, 37). Interestingly, reducing TOR 
using RNAi fails to further extend the life spans of eat-2 mutant 
worms, a model for CR, despite suppressing the already low rate of 
protein synthesis by an additional 49% (37). Furthermore, inactiva￾tion of the worm homolog of AMPK is sufficient to suppress life 
span extension in animals lacking S6K, ostensibly without affect￾ing translation (16). Clearly the relationship between translation 
and longevity is more complex than initially supposed.
Translation of specific mRNAs may influence life span. While 
complete loss of mTOR function has a major effect on gen￾eral translation, rapamycin has a more subtle effect, most likely 
because a subset of the functions of 4E-BP is rapamycin resistant 
(42, 43). Both rapamycin and complete mTOR inhibition prefer￾entially suppress translation of mRNAs with 5′ terminal oligo￾Table 1

pyrimidine motifs, suggesting a potential role for these genes in 
longevity (43, 44). Despite decreasing overall protein synthesis, CR 
in flies specifically enhances the translation of a subset of mRNAs 
that have short and less structured 5′ UTRs, including nuclear￾encoded mitochondrial genes (40). The TOR substrate 4E-BP is 
required for this effect and for life span extension. In yeast lack￾ing ribosomal subunits or TOR, full life span extension requires 
increased translation of a specific transcript, GCN4 (45). Expres￾sion of GCN4 is limited by multiple upstream ORFs that normally 
sequester ribosomes that bind to the mRNA. Under conditions of 
decreased TOR activity or large ribosomal subunit abundance, the 
upstream ORFs are more frequently bypassed to initiate transla￾tion of the GCN4 ORF. These examples highlight subtleties in the 
regulation of translation that we are only beginning to appreciate.
Autophagy. Another effect of mTOR inhibition that has been 
linked to longevity is the induction of autophagy, a process by 
which cells recycle their proteins and organelles. Autophagy allows 
cells to survive nutrient-limited conditions and is a central mecha￾nism by which damaged components are removed. Under condi￾tions of nutrient sufficiency, mTOR phosphorylates and inhibits 
the autophagy-initiating kinase ULK1 (46). Inactivation of genes 
involved in autophagy decreases life span in yeast (chronological), 
C. elegans, and Drosophila, and promotion of autophagy in the fly 
nervous system extends life span (47–49). Furthermore, autophagy 
is required for the extension by rapamycin of yeast chronological 
life span (47) and for life span extension by CR or genetic inhibi￾tion of mTOR signaling in worms (50).
In mammals autophagy also appears to play a significant role in 
the aging process. Most dramatically, the induction of autophagy 
is sufficient to rejuvenate the liver histology and function of aged 
mice (51). Furthermore, autophagy seems to be upregulated in CR 
mice, and to mediate some of the beneficial effects of a CR diet on 
the heart, liver, and kidneys (52–54). Cells from long-lived Snell 
dwarf mice also show evidence of increased autophagy (55). Car￾diomyocytes isolated from aged mice have lower autophagy and 
exhibit defects in calcium handling, both of which are corrected by 
exposure to rapamycin ex vivo (56). However, increased autophagy 
may not always be beneficial, and indeed may contribute to the 
pro-aging phenotype of progeroid mice (57).
Interestingly, rapamycin ameliorates nuclear blebbing and pre￾mature senescence in cells derived from patients with Hutchinson￾Gilford progeria, a rare premature aging syndrome (58). The dis￾ease results from a misspliced variant of lamin A, termed progerin, 
that accumulates to a large degree in patients and is also detected

in smaller amounts during normal cellular aging (59, 60). Rapamy￾cin appears to stimulate clearance of progerin from diseased cells 
via autophagy, and thus may limit the normal age-related accu￾mulation of progerin as well. Overall, the appropriate regulation 
of autophagy is likely to be a critical determinant of healthy aging.
Stem cell maintenance. Rapamycin has a number of interesting 
effects on stem cell function. Hyperactive signaling upstream of 
mTORC1 due to deletion of Pten, deletion of tuberous sclerosis 1 
(Tsc1), or constitutive activation of AKT reduces the number and 
functional capacity of HSCs (61–63). Rapamycin treatment can 
restore normal self-renewal capacity in a subpopulation of mouse 
HSCs that have spontaneously high oxidative stress and reduced 
functional capacity (64). More recently, Chen et al. noted that 
mTORC1 activity is elevated in HSCs derived from aged mice, 
which display functional deficits reminiscent of those caused 
by Tsc1 deletion (25). Rapamycin restored functional capacity 
in HSCs from aged mice and boosted the immune response to 
influenza virus. Rapamycin also increases intestinal stem cell self￾renewal via inhibition of mTORC1 in the adjacent Paneth cells, 
similar to effects that have been in observed in CR animals (65). In 
addition, rapamycin enhances the reprogramming of somatic cells 
to generate induced pluripotent stem cells, suggesting a general 
promotion of stem cell function (66). On the other hand, rapamy￾cin impairs pluripotency, reduces proliferation, and promotes 
differentiation in human embryonic stem cells (67, 68). In mouse 
embryonic stem cells, expression of pluripotency markers is more 
resistant to rapamycin treatment, yet cell size and proliferation are 
still reduced and differentiation is enhanced (67, 69). Intriguingly, 
rapamycin depletes leukemia-initiating cells and inhibits both the 
self-renewal and differentiation capacities of stem cells derived 
from infantile hemangioma, suggesting a protective effect against 
cancer stem cells (61, 70). Taken together, these results suggest 
that rapamycin modulates the behavior of stem cells and generally 
favors the retention of “stemness” and a more youthful phenotype 
in the adult stem cells types that have been studied.
Antiinflammatory mechanisms. The original clinical use of rapamy￾cin as an immunosuppressant should not be overlooked when it 
comes to longevity. Chronic, low-grade inflammation is a feature 
of aging, and almost every chronic disease has an inflammatory 
component (71). A complete discussion of the immunological 
effects of rapamycin is beyond the scope of this Review, and the 
topic has been covered elsewhere (72). Importantly, the drug has 
both positive and negative effects on innate and adaptive immu￾nity, with a net outcome that is more complex than simple immu￾nosuppression, as exemplified by its ability to enhance the immu￾nization of aged mice against influenza virus (25).
mTORC2-dependent mechanisms. Despite the high specificity of 
rapamycin for mTORC1 during acute treatment, chronic expo￾sure can also inhibit mTORC2. This effect was first observed in 
certain cultured cell lines (73), and we have recently shown that it 
also occurs in vivo in multiple tissues including liver, muscle, and 
adipose (see Figure 2). It is currently unclear whether inhibition 
of mTORC2 plays a role in the pro-longevity effects of rapamy￾cin. Female mice lacking S6K1 and female Mtor+/–Mlst8+/– mice 
are ostensibly long lived due to impairments in mTORC1-depen￾dent signaling, but data from C. elegans suggest that inhibition of 
mTORC2 can also promote longevity (21, 74). Interestingly, life 
span extension by disruption of mTORC1 in worms requires skn-1
(the homolog of mammalian NRF1/2) and daf-16 (the homolog of 
mammalian FOXOs), both transcription factors that control genes 
involved in stress defenses. Life span extension by rapamycin or 
mTORC2 disruption, however, requires only SKN-1. Consistent 
with a role for general stress defenses in the benefits of rapamycin, 
both worms and flies with impaired TOR function are stress resis￾tant, and induction of NRF1/2 and FOXO target genes has been 
detected in the livers of mice treated with rapamycin (2 mg/kg 
daily for two weeks) (20, 21).
mTOR-independent mechanisms
Some in vivo effects of rapamycin may be independent of mTOR. 
FKBP12 proteins influence sodium and calcium currents in mul￾tiple excitable cell types, in part through binding to ryanodine 
receptors (75, 76). Moreover, rapamycin also binds to FKBP52, and 
analogs that favor interaction with FKBP52 over FKBP12 exhibit 
neuroprotective properties (77).
Endocannabinoid signaling. Although rapamycin itself has not yet 
been tested, an intriguing connection between TOR and endocan￾nabinoid signaling was recently described (78). Small molecules 
analogous to a mammalian endocannabinoid were identified in 
C. elegans, and depletion of these molecules was associated with 
life span extension by CR. One specific molecule, eicosapentaenoyl

Chronic rapamycin treatment disrupts mTORC2. (A) In vivo, nutrients 
and growth factors drive the activity of mTORC1 and mTORC2, which

rapamycin inhibits mTORC1 signaling, restricting growth and promoting 
longevity without reducing insulin sensitivity. (C) Chronic treatment with 
rapamycin inhibits both mTORC1 and mTORC2, restricting growth and

ethanolamide (EPEA), was also found to be lower in worms lack￾ing S6K, and treatment with EPEA suppressed life span extension 
in both models while conferring increased susceptibility to heat 
stress. Clearly, there are many twists and turns remaining in the 
path to understanding life span extension by rapamycin, and the 
answers may offer insight into the 80-year-old mystery of how CR 
is able to delay mammalian aging.
Rapamycin side effects
Rapamycin is FDA approved for use as an immunosuppressant 
following transplant surgery and for the treatment of renal cell 
carcinoma, and has been used as a coating for coronary stents and 
in numerous clinical trials for conditions such as lymphangioleio￾myomatosis (79) and autoimmune disorders. Although rapamycin 
has clinical utility in these settings, it is unlikely to be approved for 
use as a preventative measure in healthy individuals due to sub￾stantial side effects.
One of the greatest concerns with rapamycin is its ability to 
suppress the immune system. Rapamycin extends the life spans 
of mice, but these studies have been performed in pathogen-free 
facilities. Studies have found that rapamycin boosts the function 
of the immune system against certain pathogens (80), but human 
data are often complicated by the frequent use of rapamycin in 
conjunction with other immunosuppressants. A carefully con￾trolled study of the use of rapamycin in renal transplant recipients 
found that 34% of patients experienced viral infection, while 16% 
suffered from fungal infection (24). Clearly, there are significant 
risks associated with long-term rapamycin treatment outside of a 
sanitized laboratory environment.
Rapamycin is also very frequently associated with dermatologi￾cal adverse events. In renal transplant recipients, rapamycin was 
found to lead to edema in 60% of patients and aphthous ulcers 
in 55% of patients (24). Mucositis and rash have been observed 
in other patient populations (79). Rapamycin treatment has been 
associated with hair and nail disorders, with 90% of patients 
experiencing alopecia (24), and 
with loss of testicular function and 
reduced male fertility in both humans 
and mice (30, 81).
In addition, rapamycin treatment 
leads to metabolic changes, includ￾ing hyperlipidemia, decreased insulin 
sensitivity, glucose intolerance, and an 
increased incidence of new-onset dia￾betes (79, 82). We recently found that 
rapamycin treatment promotes stem 
cell self-renewal in the intestinal crypt 
(65), but chronic rapamycin treatment 
of humans has also been associated 
with gastrointestinal events includ￾ing diarrhea. Cancer and transplant 
patients are willing to tolerate these 
side effects as well as anemia, renal 
toxicity, impaired wound healing, 
and joint pain because the benefits 
outweigh the risks (83). However, the 
trade-offs are far less likely to be con￾sidered acceptable by healthy individu￾als considering preventative measures.
Prospects for safer mTOR inhibitors
Direct inhibition of mTOR. Based on its ability to inhibit cell pro￾liferation, there has been significant interest in treating cancers 
with rapamycin. Several derivatives of rapamycin (rapalogs) with 
improved pharmacokinetics have been developed, including tem￾sirolimus, everolimus, ridaforolimus, 32-deoxo-rapamycin, and 
zotarolimus. Despite intense interest and promising results in 
animal models of cancer, rapalogs have generally disappointed in 
human trials and are currently approved only for the treatment 
of renal cell carcinoma (temsirolimus and everolimus) and for 
patients with specific types of pancreatic cancer or tuberous sclero￾sis (reviewed in ref. 84).
One possible explanation for the disappointing results to date is 
that in human cancer, rapalogs predominately inhibit mTORC1, 
leading to increased PI3K and AKT signaling by preventing nega￾tive feedback through S6K and GRB10 (Figure 1). AKT activity may 
be attenuated by subsequent mTORC2 disruption during chronic 
treatment but, if not sufficiently controlled, can promote cancer 
growth. Pharmaceutical interest has therefore focused on two new 
classes of compound: mTOR kinase inhibitors that inhibit both 
mTORC1 and mTORC2, and dual PI3K/mTOR kinase inhibitors 
(Table 3). mTOR kinase inhibitors such as torin 1 and WYE-125132 
in particular have revealed important but previously unknown bio￾logical mechanisms, including rapamycin-resistant functions of 
mTORC1 (85, 86). However, as these compounds strongly inhibit 
both mTORC1 and mTORC2, it is unlikely that they will prove to 
have fewer undesirable side effects than rapamycin. One interesting 
possible exception is caffeine, which is a weak inhibitor of TOR. 
TOR inhibition mediates life span extension in yeast exposed to 
caffeine, and it is possible that the dose received from coffee might 
be sufficient to have a mild effect on mTOR in humans (87).
Indirect inhibitors. Studies showing that S6K1–/– mice and Mtor+/–
Mlst8+/– mice have extended longevity (16, 17) suggest that specific 
inhibition of mTORC1, or perhaps of S6K1, may provide many 
of the same benefits for age-related diseases as rapamycin. S6K1

Note that the half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) presented were determined in vitro, and that 
results in cells or in vivo may be quite different. For example, Torin 2 exhibits an approximately 800-fold 
selectivity for inhibition of mTOR compared with PI3K in cells, although in vitro levels of inhibition are 
similar to those of PI3K (122). Kinase inhibitors are presumed to have similar effects on mTORC1 and 
mTORC2, although this may not always be the case. The IC50 for OSI-027 against mTORC2 is 65 nM, 
approximately 3-fold higher than the IC50 against mTORC1 (124).

inhibitors are now being developed (88), but even if sufficient 
selectivity is achieved, these compounds will require many years of 
development before FDA approval.
Fortunately, a number of FDA-approved compounds reduce 
mTORC1 activity. The most widely used by far is aspirin, which has 
been shown to decrease S6K phosphorylation in response to TNF-α
signaling (89). Aspirin may act in part by inhibiting the phosphory￾lation of TSC1 by IKKβ (90), but it was recently demonstrated that 
aspirin can also activate AMPK (91). AMPK inhibits mTORC1 activ￾ity through two independent mechanisms, the activating phos￾phorylation of TSC2 and the inhibitory phosphorylation of raptor, 
an essential component of mTORC1 (92, 93). We might therefore 
expect other compounds that activate AMPK to specifically inhibit 
mTORC1 activity. In fact, this is the case: activation of AMPK by 
5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1β-d-ribonucleoside (AICAR) 
results in decreased mTORC1 activity (94). Interestingly, aspirin 
influences longevity in rodent models, extending the average but 
not maximum life span of male mice (95), and has been found to 
decrease cancer-related and all-cause mortality in humans (96).
A screen of FDA-approved compounds for regulators of autoph￾agy identified four compounds that reduce mTORC1 activity 
without affecting mTORC2: perhexiline, niclosamide, rottlerin, 
and amiodarone (97). Rottlerin regulates mTORC1 in a TSC￾dependent fashion, but the mechanisms of action for perhexiline, 
niclosamide, and amiodarone are TSC independent (97). At least 
one natural product, phenethyl isothiocyanate, has also been 
shown to inhibit mTORC1 activity in a TSC-dependent manner 
(98). Given the wide variety of factors that can influence signal￾ing through the mTOR complexes, many drugs are likely to have 
downstream effects on these pathways, particularly those that tar￾get insulin/IGF-1 signaling.
Is metformin a safer mTOR inhibitor? A widely used FDA-approved 
AMPK activator is metformin, the first-line drug for the treatment 
of type 2 diabetes (99). Treatment with metformin lowers blood 
glucose levels, inhibits lipolysis, and decreases circulating free 
fatty acids, while producing few undesired side effects (100). The 
exact mechanism by which metformin acts is uncertain, but much 
attention has been focused on its ability to activate AMPK (101). 
Metformin inhibits phosphorylation of the mTORC1 substrates 
S6K1 and 4E-BP1 and decreases translation (102). While these 
effects were originally believed to result solely from the action of 
AMPK, it was recently demonstrated that metformin also regu￾lates mTORC1 directly via inhibition of the Ras-related GTP bind￾ing (Rag) GTPases (see Figure 3 and ref. 103) and indirectly via 
upregulation of REDD1, which promotes TSC2 activity (104).
Substantial evidence suggests that metformin functions to 
promote longevity in worms, rodents, and humans. Metfor￾min extends both the life span and health span of the nematode 
C. elegans (105). These effects are independent of the insulin sig￾naling pathway but are dependent on AMPK, as well as the oxi￾dative stress transcription factor SKN-1/NRF2 (105). Metformin 
extends the life span of short-lived, tumor-prone HER2/neu mice 
and female SHR mice (106, 107). The National Institute on Aging 
Intervention Testing Program is currently treating genetically 
heterogeneous mice with metformin in order to definitively test 
its effect on life span. Interestingly, a long-term study in human 
patients found that treatment with metformin in patients with 
diabetes decreased mortality from all causes, including diabetes￾related mortality, cancer, and myocardial infarction (108, 109). 
Importantly, an effect on maximum life span in humans or long￾lived rodents has yet to be demonstrated.
Conclusion
Rapamycin shows significant promise in animal models as a phar￾maceutical agent for the treatment of age-related disease. However, 
the significant side effects limit its long-term utility in humans. 
Similar problems are likely to emerge for rapalogs and mTOR 
kinase inhibitors. Moving forward, mTORC1-specific inhibitors 
that avoid disruption of mTORC2 signaling or that only reduce, 
rather than abolish, the activity of the mTORC1 pathway, may 
offer a safer method for the treatment of age-related diseases. The 
exploration of different dosing regimens for rapamycin and further 
testing of metformin have significant promise in this regard, but 
further research will be required to determine whether any of the 
available strategies for targeting mTOR will ultimately prove ben￾eficial to human longevity and protect against age-related diseases.

Metformin regulates mTORC1 signaling. Metformin activates AMPK by 
inhibiting oxidative phosphorylation, which in turn negatively regulates 
mTORC1 signaling via activation of TSC2 and inhibitory phosphory￾lation of raptor. In parallel, metformin inhibits mTORC1 signaling by 
suppressing the activity of the Rag GTPases and upregulating REDD1.
