Abstract
Glucocorticoids are important regulators of renal phosphate
transport. This study investigates the role of alterations in
renal brush border membrane (BBM) sodium gradient-de￾pendent phosphate transport (Na-Pi cotransporter) mRNA
and protein abundance in the dexamethasone induced inhi￾bition of Na-Pi cotransport in the rat. Dexamethasone ad￾ministration for 4 d caused a 1.5-fold increase in the V,..
of Na-Pi cotransport (1785±119 vs. 2759±375 pmol/5 s per
mg BBM protein in control, P < 0.01), which was paralleled
by a 2.5-fold decrease in the abundance of Na-Pi mRNA
and Na-Pi protein. There was also a 1.7-fold increase in
BBM glucosylceramide content (528±63 vs. 312±41 ng/mg
BBM protein in control, P < 0.02). To determine whether
the alteration in glucosylceramide content per se played a
functional role in the decrease in Na-Pi cotransport, control
rats were treated with the glucosylceramide synthase inhib￾itor, D-threo-l-phenyl-2-decanoyl-amino-3-morpholino-1-
propanol (PDMP). The resultant 1.5-fold decrease in BBM
glucosylceramide content (199±19 vs. 312±41 ng/mg BBM
protein in control, P < 0.02) was associated with a 1.4-fold
increase in Na-Pi cotransport activity (1422±73 vs. 1048±85
pmol/5 s per mg BBM protein in control, P < 0.01), and a
1.5-fold increase in BBM Na-Pi protein abundance. Thus,
dexamethasone-induced inhibition of Na-Pi cotransport is
associated with a decrease in BBM Na-Pi cotransporter
abundance, and an increase in glucosylceramide. Since pri￾mary alteration in BBM glucosylceramide content per se
directly and selectively modulates BBM Na-Pi cotransport
activity and Na-Pi protein abundance, we propose that the
increase in BBM glucosylceramide content plays an im￾portant role in mediating the inhibitory effect of dexametha￾sone on Na-Pi cotransport activity. (J. Clin. Invest. 1995.

the administration of glucocorticoids to humans or experimental
animals decreases tubular reabsorption of phosphate ( 1-3 ). In
contrast, glucocorticoid deficiency after adrenalectomy in￾creases tubular reabsorption of phosphate (4). The primary site
of action of glucocorticoids to reduce phosphate reabsorption
is the proximal tubule (5), an effect that is independent of
endogenous parathyroid hormone activity (6). This inhibitory
effect of glucocorticoids on renal tubular phosphate transport
is expressed at the level of the proximal tubular apical brush
border membranes (7, 8). The decrease in sodium gradient￾dependent phosphate transport (Na-Pi cotransport)' results
from a decrease in the V. rather than a change in the affinity
for phosphate (8). It is not known whether the decrease in the
V., reflects a decrease in the number of active Na-Pi cotrans￾port proteins or a change in the transport properties of existing
Na-Pi cotransport proteins.
Studies in freshly isolated proximal tubular cells or in pri￾mary cultured renal cells indicate that glucocorticoids have a
direct and selective inhibitory effect on Na-Pi cotransport dem￾onstrating that the effect is independent of concomitant alter￾ations in renal hemodynamics and/or other phosphate transport
regulatory hormones (9-10). In cultured chick renal cells, dex￾amethasone inhibition of Na-Pi cotransport is blocked by inhibi￾tors of transcription (actinomycin D) and translation (cyclohex￾imide) (10). The nature of the inhibitory proteins produced
by dexamethasone is unknown. They could inhibit of Na-Pi
cotransport by causing a decrease in the abundance of Na-Pi
cotransport proteins. Alternatively, they might alter membrane
lipid composition, since alterations in brush border membrane
lipid content or lipid dynamics also regulate Na-Pi cotransport
( 11 ). Thus, inhibitors of RNA and protein synthesis could block
dexamethasone induced inhibition of Na-Pi cotransport through
an effect on the synthesis and content of specific membrane
lipids.
Recently the cDNA for a Na-Pi cotransport system of rat
kidney cortex (NaPi-2) has been identified by expression clon￾ing (12). Using polyclonal antibodies raised against this renal
Na-Pi cotransport system, and using the polymerase chain reac￾tion after reverse transcription of mRNA in microdissected
nephron segments, we recently demonstrated that NaPi-2-re￾lated mRNA and protein is expressed in the brush border mem￾branes of the proximal tubules in rat kidney (13).
The present study investigates (a) whether the inhibitory
effect of dexamethasone on Na-Pi cotransport is mediated by
changes in Na-Pi cotransport mRNA and protein abundance

and/or a change in brush border membrane lipid composition
and lipid dynamics, and (b) whether the alteration in brush
border membrane lipid composition per se can directly modulate
Na-Pi cotransport activity.
Methods
Experimental animals
The experiments were performed in male Sprague Dawley rats weighing
150-200 grams (Harlan Industries, Indianapolis, IN). Before study, the
animals were stabilized on the control diet (0.6% Pi) for 5 d in metabolic
balance cages. The rats were then treated with dexamethasone, 100
pg/ 100 gram body weight, or vehicle (deionized water), administered
subcutaneously once a day for four consecutive days. On the fourth
day, a 24-h urine collection was obtained. On the fifth day, the rats
were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital, blood was obtained from
the inferior vena cava, and the kidneys rapidly removed and placed in
an ice-cold buffer. Blood and urine samples were analyzed for inorganic
phosphate by the method of Fiske and Subbarow ( 14), and for creatinine
by a creatinine autoanalyzer (Creatinine H Analyzer, Beckman, Fuller￾ton, CA). Total urinary phosphate excretion and tubular reabsorption
of phosphate were calculated by standard clearance formulae.
In experiments designed to determine the role of alteration in gluco￾sylceramide content per se in the regulation of Na-Pi cotransport (see
Results), control animals were treated with DL-threo-1-phenyl-2-deca￾noylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (PDMP), an inhibitor of glucosyl￾ceramide synthase (15-16). Since previous studies have demonstrated
that the circulating plasma levels of PDMP are prolonged in the presence
of the cytochrome P450 inhibitor, piperonyl butoxide ( 16), the butoxide
solution was administered before injection of PDMP. The piperonyl
butoxide was prepared by dissolution in corn oil at a concentration of
150 mg/ml oil. On the first day of treatment, the butoxide solution was
administered intraperitoneally 4 h before PDMP treatment; on days 2
to 4 of treatment, it was administered just before the PDMP injection.
PDMP was prepared as an emulsion with the detergent Myrj 52 in
normal saline, buffered with sodium acetate. The final concentrations
were PDMP 6 mg/dl, Myrj 52 12 mg/dl, and sodium acetate 8 mg/dl.
The PDMP was given intraperitoneally as a dose of 100 mg/kg body
weight.
Brush border membrane isolation
The kidneys were placed in an ice-cold homogenizing buffer consisting
of 300 mM mannitol, 5 mM EGTA, 0.1 mM PMSF, 16 mM HEPES,
pH 7.50 with Tris. Thin slices were cut from the superficial cortex and
homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer. Brush border membrane
(BBM) vesicles were isolated from the resulting homogenate by differ￾ential centrifugation and Mg2+ precipitation, as previously described
(17). To minimize the potential day-to-day variations in BBM isolation
procedure on the resultant measurements, each day BBM from control
and dexamethasone-treated rats were isolated simultaneously. For each
BBM sample the kidneys from three rats from each experimental group
were pooled (n = 1). A total of 36 rats were studied in each group,
resulting in n = 12 BBM samples for each experimental group. The
final BBM pellet was resuspended in a 300 mM mannitol, 16 mM
Hepes, 10 mM Tris, pH 7.50 buffer and was aliquoted for simultaneous
measurements of (a) enzyme activity, (b) transport activity, (c) protein
electrophoresis and Western blotting, (d) lipid composition, and (e)
lipid fluidity.
Brush border membrane enzyme activity measurements
The purity of each BBM preparation was determined by measurement
of membrane-bound specific enzyme activity, including leucine amino￾peptidase (apical marker) and Na,K-ATPase (basolateral marker) in
cortical homogenate and in BBM fractions as previously described ( 18).
Enzyme activities were expressed as prmol/h per mg cortical homoge￾nate or BBM protein. Enrichment (specific activity in BBM/specific
activity in homogenate) and recovery (total activity in BBM/total activ￾ity in homogenate) were determined using the above enzymes as mark￾ers of apical and basolateral membranes. Protein was determined by the
method of Lowry et al (19) using crystalline BSA as standard.
Brush border membrane transport measurements
Transport measurements were performed in freshly isolated BBM vesi￾cles by radiotracer uptake followed by rapid millipore filtration. To
measure Na+ gradient-dependent 32Pi uptake (Na-Pi cotransport), 10
M1 of BBM preloaded in an intravesicular buffer of 300 mM mannitol,
16 mM Hepes, 10 mM Tris, pH 7.50 was vortex mixed at 250C with
40 Ml of an extravesicular uptake buffer of 150 mM NaCl, 100 OM
K2H32P04, 16 mM Hepes, 10 mM Tris, pH 7.50. Uptake after 5 s
(representing initial linear rate) was terminated by an ice-cold stop
solution which consisted of 135 mM NaCl, 10 mM Na2 arsenate, 16
mM Hepes, 10 mM Tris, pH 7.50. All uptake measurements were per￾formed in triplicate, and uptake was calculated on the basis of specific
activity determined in each experiment and expressed as pmol 32Pi/5 s
per mg BBM protein.
To determine if the differences in Na-Pi cotransport were specific
for Pi, Na+ gradient-dependent glucose and proline uptake were also
measured. BBM vesicles were preloaded with the 300 mM mannitol￾HEPES-Tris (pH 7.50) intravesicular buffer, and the uptake solution
consisted of 150 mM NaCl and either 100 /tM D- [3H]glucose, or 100
pM L-[3H]proline and HEPES-Tris, pH 7.50. Uptake was terminated
by the stop solution, which consisted of 150 mM NaCl, 0.25 M phlorid￾zin, and Hepes-Tris added to pH 7.50.
Brush border membrane protein electrophoresis and
Western blots
BBM were denatured for 2 min at 95°C in 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 1
mM EDTA, 95 mM Tris/HCl, pH 6.8 (final concentrations) and 40 Htg
BBM protein per lane were electrophoresed on 10% polyacrylamide
gels according to Laemmli (20), as previously described (21). After
electrophoretic transfer onto nitrocellulose membranes (BA83;
Schleicher & Schuell, Keene, NH) Western blots were performed using
antisera against NaPi-2 and 5 '-nucleotidase at dilutions of 1:4,000 and
1:5,000, respectively. Production of polyclonal antibodies against
COOH- and NH2-terminal synthetic peptide of a recently cloned Na-Pi
cotransport system of rat kidney cortex (NaPi-2) (12) has been recently
described ( 13). Polyclonal antibodies against renal ecto-5 '-nucleotidase
were obtained against the purified enzyme as described and character￾ized (22). Primary antibody binding was visualized using goat anti￾rabbit IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Bio Rad Laboratories,
Richmond, CA) and quantified by densitometry. Prestained molecular
weight marker proteins (Bio Rad Laboratories) were run in parallel.
Brush border membrane lipid composition measurements
Lipids from brush border membrane were extracted by the method of
Bligh and Dyer (23), as we have previously described (17-18).
To determine free cholesterol content. An aliquot of the lipid extract
was injected into a 530 tm 50% phenylmethyl silicone column in a
Hewlett Packard model 5890 gas chromatograph with a flame ionization
detector, run isothermally at 280°C, with coprostanol serving as an
internal standard. Area ratios were completed with a Hewlett-Packard
3392A integrator, and cholesterol was expressed as nmol per mg brush
border membrane protein ( 11).
To determine individual phospholipid polar head group species. An
aliquot of the lipid extract was applied to thin layer chromatography
plates (Silica Gel 60, E. Merck, Darmstadt, FRG) and individual phos￾pholipids including sphingomyelin, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidyl￾ethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidylinositol were sepa￾rated by a two-dimension solvent system (24), as we have previously
described (17-18). Phospholipid content in total and individual phos￾pholipids was determined by measuring phosphorus content by the
method of Ames and Dubin (25).
To determine the glycosphingolipid composition. An aliquot of the
lipid extract was evaporated to dryness and subjected to alkaline metha￾nolysis. Briefly, the dried lipids were dissolved in 2 ml of chloroform.
208 Levi et al.

The reaction was started by adding 1 ml of 0.21 N sodium hydroxide
in methanol, continued for 1 h at 370C and terminated by adding 0.8
ml of 0.2 M acetic acid. The resultant mixture was centrifuged for 5
min at 800 grams. The upper layer was removed. The lower layer was
washed with 1 ml of methanol plus 0.8 ml of water. After the same
centrifugation, the lower layer was transferred into another glass tube
and dried under a stream of nitrogen gas. The lipids were then chromato￾graphed on high performance thin layer chromatography plates
(HPTLC, E. Merck 5641): glucosylceramide was separated with a sol￾vent system consisting of chloroform:methanol:water (65:25:4) on
plates which were pretreated with 2.5% borax in methanol:water (1: 1).
The lipid bands were visualized by impregnating the plates with a modi￾fied charring reagent (100 grams of CuSO45H2O in conc. H3PO4/water/
methanol (100:750:400) (16). The charred TLC plates were scanned
with a video densitometer. The glucosylceramide bands were quantitated
by comparing the density of each spot with the density of the corre￾sponding standard curve.
To determine the glycosphingolipid molecular species. The lipid
extracts were dissolved in chloroform:methanol, 2:1, vol/vol, and parti￾tioned into lower and upper phase GSL according to Folch et al. (26).
The lower phase GSL were put over a Unisil column and eluted with
acetone:methanol, 9:1, vol/vol. After alkaline hydrolysis the samples
were dried and perbenzoylated in 10% benzoyl chloride in pyridine for
16 h at 370C. The benzoylated glycolipids were then dissolved in carbon
tetrachloride, and injected onto a silica gel column (Zipax, E.I. Dupont,
Wilmington, DE, 2.1 mm x 50 cm) and eluted with a 13-min linear
gradient of 1-20% dioxane in hexane with a flow rate of 2 ml/min
(27). Absorption was read at 230 nm. The individual GSL peaks were
integrated by a Dynamax system on a Macintosh SE computer.
Brush border membrane lipid fluidity measurements
BBM fluidity was determined by the steady-state and time-resolved
fluorescence measurements of (a) 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5,-hexatriene
(DPH), and (b) 6-dodecanoyl-2-diethylaminonaphthalene (Laurdan)
(Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The steady-state emission spectra of
Laurdan was measured in a spectrofluorometer (SLM 4800C, Urbana,
IL). Excitation wavelength was 340 am, and emission was measured
at 440 nm and 490 nm. In phospholipid vesicles and in BBM the
emission maximum for Laurdan is 440 nm in the gel phase and 490 nm
in the liquid-crystalline phase (28-29). The emission spectra of Laur￾dan is quantitated by the generalized polarization (GP)
GP1d - 144w) - I490
I440 + I490
where 40 and 490 are the emission intensities at 440 and 490 nm,
respectively (28-29).
The steady-state anisotropy of DPH (rDpH) was measured in the same
spectrofluorometer equipped with excitation and emission polarizers.
Excitation wavelength was 360 nm and emission was viewed through
a KV 399 nm filter. rDpH is determined by:
In -II
-In + 2II
where III and I represent the intensities of the parallel and perpendicular
components of the emission respectively (17).
The fluorescence lifetimes of DPH and Laurdan were measured
with use of a photon counting multifrequency phase and modulation
spectrofluorometer (ISS K2, Urbana, IL) using the 351 nm excitation
line of an argon ion laser (30). The dynamic polarization of DPH
was also measured with use of a multifrequency differential phase and
modulation spectrofluorometer using the 351 nm excitation line of an
argon ion laser. The time-resolved fluorescence data were analyzed with
Globals Unlimited software (Laboratory for Fluorescence Dynamics,
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, IL) (31).
RNA isolation
Thin slices were cut at 40C from the superficial cortex and homogenized
with Polytron in a 4 M guanidium thiocyanate, 25 mM sodium citrate,
pH 7.0; 0.5% sarcosyl, 0.1 M 2-mercaptoethanol denaturation solution.
Sequentially, 0.1 vol 2 M sodium acetate, pH 4.0, 1 vol water-saturated
phenol, and 0.2 vol chloroform-isoamyl alcohol mixture (49:1) were
added to the homogenate. Total RNA was isolated as previously de￾scribed (32), and resuspended in water treated with diethyl pyrocarbo￾nate (DEPC). Absorbance at 260 and 280 nm were obtained to quantify
and asses the purity of the RNA fraction.
Formaldehyde agarose gel electrophoresis and Northern
blot analysis
After denaturation of RNA samples in formaldehyde, 20 j.g total RNA
per lane was size fractionated using 0.66 M formaldehyde, 1% agarose
(final concentration) gels (BioRad Laboratory). RNA size standards
(GIBCO BRL, Gaithersburg, MD) were run in parallel. After electro￾phoresis the gel was placed onto a vacuum-blotting device (BioRad
Laboratories) and vacuum of 60 cm H20 was applied for 4 h using 20X
SSC (3 M NaCl, 0.3 M Na3 citrate, pH 7.0) as blotting buffer, which
resulted in complete transfer of RNA. The RNA was blotted onto Gene￾Screen Plus nylon membranes (NEN/DuPont, Boston, MA) and the
RNA was immobilized by irradiation with ultraviolet (U.V.) light (UV
crosslinker; BioRad Laboratories). Prehybridization (4 h at 420C) and
hybridization (18 h at 420() of the RNA blots were performed with a
buffer (250 jil/cm2) consisting of 5 x SSPE (0.75 M NaCl, 50 mM
NaH2PO4, 5 mM EDTA, pH 7.40), Sx Denhardt's solution, [0.1%
Ficoll 400, 0.1% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.1% BSA (fraction V)], 0.1%
SDS, 100 jig/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA, and 50% deionized
formamide as previously described (33). cDNA probes of NaPi-2 (12),
,/-Actin (34) and GAPDH (35), all full length, were labeled by random
priming (Pharmacia Biotech Inc., Piscataway, NJ) using [a-32P] dCTP
(NEN-DuPont, Boston, MA). After hybridization, the blots were
washed twice for 15 min each time in 2x SSPE, 0.1% SDS at room
temperature, twice for 15 min each time in 0.1 x SSPE, 0.1% SDS at
370C, and twice for 15 min each time in 0.1 x SSPE, 0.1% SDS at
50°C. Autoradiography was performed at -70°C with NEN-DuPont
Reflection film using a DuPont intensifying screen (NEN-DuPont).
Membranes were stripped (0.1 x SSC, 0.1% SDS at 950C for 5 min)
before another hybridization was performed. mRNA levels for NaPi-2
was quantitated by densitometry and normalized to the density of the
corresponding GAPDH and,B-actin mRNA.
Data analysis
The data are expressed as the mean±SE. The statistical significance of
the results between samples obtained from control and experimental
rats was determined by the unpaired students t test or one way analysis of
variance with Student-Newman Keul analysis for multiple comparisons.
Significance was accepted at the P < 0.05 level.
Results
The effect of dexamethasone on urinary phosphate excretion.
Dexamethasone administration caused a significant increase in
urinary excretion of Pi and a decrease in the tubular reabsorption
of Pi. These occurred despite a decrease in serum Pi concentra￾tion (Table I).
The effect ofdexamethasone on BBM enzyme activity. Dexa￾methasone had no effect on the activity of the apical membrane
enzyme marker leucine aminopeptidase. Enrichment and recov￾ery of leucine aminopeptidase was similar in BBM isolated
from control and dexamethasone-treated rats. As previously de￾scribed (36), dexamethasone caused an increase in the activity
of the basolateral membrane enzyme marker Na,K-ATPase. En￾richment and recovery of Na,K-ATPase was, however, minimal
and similar in BBM isolated from control and dexamethasone￾treated rats (Table II). BBM isolated from control and dexa￾methasone-treated rats were, therefore, highly and similarly pu￾rified.

The effect of dexamethasone on BBM transport activity.
Dexamethasone caused a significant decrease in BBM Na-Pi
cotransport activity. The decrease in Na-Pi- cotransport was se￾lective as dexamethasone did not cause changes in Na-glucose
or Na-proline cotransport activities (Fig. 1). The decrease in
Na-Pi cotransport in dexamethasone-treated rats was not caused
by a faster dissipation of the Na' gradient via the enhanced
activity of the Na/H antiporter, as, in the presence of 3 mM
amiloride, Na-Pi cotransport was still significantly decreased
(954±22 in dexamethasone vs. 1386±123 pmol 32Pi/5 s per
mg BBM protein in control, P < 0.01).
The effect of dexamethasone on BBM Na-Pi cotransport
kinetics. Kinetics of Na-Pi cotransport in the presence of 150
mM NaCl and as a function of extravesicular Pi ranging from
25 to 800 .tM Pi indicated that dexamethasone caused a de￾crease the V, of Na-Pi cotransport, whereas, dexamethasone
did not change the affinity for Pi (Fig. 2). Similarly, kinetics
of Na-Pi cotransport in the presence of 800 uM Pi and as a
function of extravesicular NaCl ranging from 0 to 150 mM
NaCl indicated that dexamethasone caused a decrease in the
V, of Na-Pi cotransport, whereas, dexamethasone did not
change the affinity for Na, or the stoichiometry for Na-Pi co￾transport (data not shown).

The effect of dexamethasone on renal cortical Na-Pi mRNA
abundance. To determine if the Vm,, of Na-Pi cotransport was
associated with a decrease in Na-Pi mRNA, RNA isolated from
control and dexamethasone treated rats were analyzed by North￾ern blots. As illustrated in Fig. 3, NaPi-2 mRNa shown by a
2.6-kb transcript is significantly decreased in dexamethasone
treated rats. Ethidium bromide staining of the gel and rehybrid￾ization of the Northern blot with GAPDH or /3-actin cDNA
probes indicate that the decrease in NaPi-2 mRNA abundance
is not due to differences in RNA loading on the gels. The
abundance of NaPi-2 mRNA relative to GAPDH or P-actin
mRNA, determined by densitometric analysis, indicates that
NaPi-2 mRNA is decreased by 2.5-fold in dexamethasone
treated rats.
The effect of dexamethasone on BBM Na-Pi cotransporter
abundance. To determine if the dexamethasone induced de￾crease in the Vma,, of Na-Pi cotransport was associated with a
decrease in Na-Pi cotransporter abundance, BBM isolated from
control and dexamethasone treated rats were analyzed by West￾ern blots using the anti (NaPi-2)-antiserum. As illustrated in
Fig. 4, a strong reaction with a 80-90-kD protein bands was
observed in BBM from control and dexamethasone rats. Densi￾tometric analysis of the reaction with these protein bands
showed that in BBM isolated from dexamethasone treated rats
there was a 2.5-fold decrease in the staining intensity when
compared to BBM isolated from control rats. The staining pat￾tern is specific since these protein bands were not visualized in
the presence of preimmune serum and were completely pro￾tected by antigenic peptide (13). As a control the same BBM
were analyzed for the presence of ecto-5 '-nucleotidase by West￾ern blots. Densitometric analysis of the staining intensity
showed no difference in BBM isolated from dexamethasone
treated vs control rats.
The effect of dexamethasone on BBM lipid composition.
Dexamethasone caused significant changes in BBM lipid com￾position. Dexamethasone increased glucosylceramide mass con￾tent (528±63 in dexamethasone vs. 312±41 ng/mg BBM pro￾tein in control, P < 0.02). Dexamethasone also caused signifi￾cant alterations in neutral glycosphingolipid species, in that
there are increases in the relative amounts of hydroxylated and/
or phytosphingosine containing glucosylceramide species (Ta￾ble III). Dexamethasone caused significant alterations in phos￾pholipid species as well, including an increase in sphirgomye￾210 Levi et al.

lin, a decrease in phosphatidylcholine, resulting in an increase
in the sphingomyelin to phosphatidylcholine mole ratio (Table
IV). Dexamethasone had no effect on phosphatidylethanol￾amine, phosphatidylserine, or phosphatidylinositol mole content

Dexamethasone also significantly decreased the rotational diffu￾sion of DPH as measured by the dynamic polarization of DPH.
Dexamethasone caused an increase in the limiting anisotropy,

Dexamethasone also increased the generalized polarization

therefore, indicate that dexamethasone causes a decrease in
BBM lipid fluidity.
The effect ofPDMP on BBM glucosylceramide content and
Na-Pi cotransport activity. The administration of the glucosyl￾ceramide synthase inhibitor PDMP to control rats significantly
decreased glucosylceramide content (199±19 with PDMP vs.
312±41 ng/mg BBM protein in control, P < 0.02). The effect
of PDMP on glucosylceramide content was quite specific as
PDMP caused no changes in BBM cholesterol, total phospho￾lipid, sphingomyelin, or phosphatidyicholine content (Table
VI). The effect of PDMP to lower BBM glucosylceramide
content was associated with a significant increase in BBM Na￾Pi cotransport activity (Fig. 7). The effect of PDMP was spe￾cific and selective for Na-Pi, as PDMP did not significantly
alter Na-glucose or Na-proline cotransport activities (Fig. 7).
The effect of PDMP to increase BBM Na-Pi cotransport activity
was associated with a 1.5-fold increase in BBM NaPi-2 protein
abundance (Fig. 4). Interestingly, the increase in NaPi-2 protein
abundance was not associated with an increase in NaPi-2
mRNA abundance (Fig. 3). The effect of PDMP to lower BBM
glucosylceramide content was also associated with an increase
in BBM lipid fluidity, as reflected by a significant decrease .in
the steady-state fluorescence anisotropy of DPH (Fig. 8).
Discussion
This study demonstrates that dexamethasone selectively inhibits
BBM Na-Pi cotransport activity, an effect mediated by a de￾crease in the V,.,. There was no change in the affinities of the
transporter for Na or Pi. These results agree with previous stud￾ies also showing that the inhibitory effect of dexamethasone
on NaPi cotransport is independent of endogenous parathyroid
hormone activity and of dietary Pi content (6, 8).
The decrease in V., of renal cortical BBM NaPi cotransport
in dexamethasone treated rats correlated with parallel decreases
in renal cortical NaPi-2 mRNA content and renal cortical BBM
NaPi-2 protein abundance. The decreases in transcription and
translation of Na-Pi cotransporter plays an important role in the
dexamethasone induced inhibition of Na-Pi cotransport. Since
in a previous study actinomycin D and cycloheximide blocked
the inhibition of Na-Pi cotransport, it is possible that dexametha￾sone may activate a regulatory protein which then inhibits Na￾Pi specific transcription and translation.
The decrease in the V,, of Na-Pi cotransport also correlated
with increases in BBM glucosylceramide and sphingomyelin
content. Dexamethasone was shown to increase the sphingomy￾elin content of 3T3-L1 and HeLa cells by increasing the rate
of sphingomyelin synthesis from phosphatidylcholine (38, 39).
The present study is the first to determine the effect of dexa￾methasone on renal BBM sphingomyelin composition. We
found that dexamethasone increased sphingomyelin content by
9.3%. This was paralleled by an 8.0% decrease in phosphatidyl￾choline content. These results are compatible with observations
on many cell lines, including the kidney, that sphingomyelin is

in BBM sphingomyelin content is associated with a similar but
opposite change in phosphatidylcholine content (17, 18). The
net result is no overall change in the sum total of BBM sphingo￾myelin plus phosphatidyicholine content.
Dahiya and Brasitus had reported that dexamethasone in￾creased rat renal cortical and medullary total neutral glycosphin￾golipid content (42). In our study, we specifically measured
the effect of dexamethasone on superficial cortical BBM gluco￾sylceramide content since we were interested in correlating the
effects of dexamethasone on BBM Na-Pi cotransport with the
potential effects of dexamethasone on BBM glycosphingolipid
composition. Our study does not determine whether the effect
of dexamethasone to increase glucosylceramide content is medi￾ated by increased rate of synthesis or decreased rate of degrada￾tion of glucosylceramide (15). Dexamethasone enhances gluco￾neogenesis in rat kidney cortex (8). Increased gluconeogenesis
may increase UDP-glucose, providing increased substrate for

glucosylceramide synthesis (15), even in the absence of
changes in the activities of glucosylceramide synthase or gluco￾sylceramide /-glucosidase. These later enzymes regulate gluco￾sylceramide synthesis and hydrolysis, respectively ( 15 ). Dahiya
and Brasitus had reported that dexamethasone increased the
concentration of neutral glycosphingolipids and the short chain
hydroxy fatty acids of glucosylceramide. While these data are
not directly comparable to those presented here in that a differ￾ent strain of rats (Sherman vs. Sprague Dawley) was used and
total kidney rather than cortical BBM was analyzed, the data are,
nevertheless, consistent in that there appears to be an increase in
the hydroxylated neutral glycosphingolipid species following
dexamethasone (42). Interestingly, in addition to the effect of
increased levels of sphingomyelin, an increase in the relative
amounts of the more polar hydroxylated glycosphingolipid spe￾cies would also be expected to cause a decrease in membrane
fluidity (43).
Our study indicates that the dexamethasone induced increase

in BBM glucosylceramide content is correlated with a selective
decrease in Na-Pi cotransport. On the other hand, in rats treated
with the glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor PDMP, the de￾crease in BBM glucosylceramide content is associated with a
selective increase in BBM Na-Pi cotransport activity. Thus, our
studies establish an inverse correlation between BBM gluco￾sylceramide content and BBM Na-Pi cotransport activity (Fig.
9). Furthermore, there is also an inverse correlation between
BBM glucosylceramide content and BBM NaPi-2 protein abun￾dance. Our results therefore suggest that the dexamethasone
induced alteration in BBM glucosylceramide content and/or
other related glycosphingolipids may mediate the inhibitory ef￾fect of dexamethasone on Na-Pi cotransport activity and BBM
NaPi-2 protein abundance.
At the present time it is not known how alterations in BBM
lipid composition modulate Na-Pi cotransport activity. Recent
studies indicate that alterations in glycosphingolipid content
control cellular functions by diverse mechanisms. In several
cell types 1,25 dihydroxy vitamin D3, TNF-a, and y-inferferon
have been shown to induce hydrolysis of membrane sphingomy￾elin and generation of ceramide (44-46). Ceramide has been
shown to have diverse second messenger functions including
(a) ceramide-activated protein kinase and phosphatase, (b)
phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor, (c)
activation of Raf, MEK, MAP kinase and phospholipase A2, (d)
degradation of IkB, the physiologic inhibitor of the transcription
factor NK-kB, with subsequent translocation to the nucleus, and

(e) downregulation of c-myc expression (44-47). In addition,
glycosphingolipids may also modulate protein delivery from the
endoplasmic reticulum-golgi complex to the plasma mem￾brane. In baby hamster kidney cells, inhibition of glucosylcera￾mide synthase with PDMP markedly decreases plasma mem￾brane glucosylceramide content and also impairs plasma mem￾brane delivery of the vesicular stomatitis virus G (VSV-G)
protein (48). Therefore, glycophinglipids can modulate cell
function by transcriptional/translational as well as posttransla￾tional mechanisms. Our data indicates that in dexamethasone
treated rats the increase in BBM glucosylceramide content is
correlated with decreases in NaPi-2 mRNA and NaPi-2 protein
abundance. In contrast, in PDMP treated rats the decrease in
BBM glucosylceramide content is correlated with an increase
in NaPi-2 protein abundance, independent of changes in NaPi￾2 mRNA abundance.
Alterations in BBM lipid composition could also alter the
lipid mobility and/or the lipid dynamics which could in turn
modulate Na-Pi cotransport activity (11). In our study, we
found dexamethasone induced increases in BBM glucosylcera￾mide and sphingomyelin content were associated with signifi￾cant changes in steady-state anisotropy, lifetime distribution,
and rotational diffusion rate of the fluorescent probe DPH, as
well as significant changes in the emission spectra and lifetime
of the phase-sensitive fluorescent probe Laurdan. These changes
indicate that dexamethasone causes less "fluid" and/or more
"ordered or gel-like" microenvironments in the BBM lipid
bilayer (29). In agreement with our previous findings (11)
these changes are associated with a selective modulation of Na￾Pi cotransport, while there are no changes in Na-glucose or
Na-proline cotransport activities. The effects of increases in
membrane glycosphingolipid content and/or dexamethasone
administration to decrease membrane fluidity occurs in several
(49-51), but not all (52-54) cells of non-renal origin. The
effect of PDMP to decrease BBM glucosylceramide content
and increase BBM Na-Pi cotransport activity, on the other hand,
is associated with an increase in BBM fluidity. Thus, in addition
to the inverse correlation between BBM glucosylceramide con￾tent and BBM Na-Pi cotransport activity (Fig. 9), there is also
214 Levi et al.
u

a direct correlation between BBM fluidity and BBM Na-Pi co￾transport activity.
In summary, these studies indicate that dexamethasone in￾duced decrease in the Vn,. of BBM Na-Pi cotransport is corre￾lated with decreases in renal cortical NaPi-2 mRNA and BBM
NaPi-2 protein abundance, and with an increase in BBM glyco￾sphingolipid content. Since primary alteration in BBM gluco￾sylceramide content selectively modulates BBM Na-Pi cotrans￾port activity and NaPi-2 protein abundance, we propose that
the dexamethasone induced increase in BBM glucosylceramide
content, or a closely related glycosphingolipid, plays an im￾portant role in mediating the inhibitory effect of dexamethasone
on Na-Pi cotransport activity.
