SUMMARY
Tacrolimus is an immunosuppressant frequently used
following solid organ transplantation, including renal
transplantation. Peripheral neuropathy is an uncommon
neurological side effect of tacrolimus and has rarely been
reported in renal transplantation. We report a patient
who received a living-related donor kidney transplant
and presented with altered mental status and new-onset
bilateral foot drop. Laboratory tests including
cerebrospinal fluid tests excluded infection, and MRI of
the brain showed chronic microvascular ischaemic
changes. Electromyography and nerve conduction study
confirmed bilateral common peroneal nerve
demyelination. He was also found to have inadvertently
overdosed on tacrolimus at home. After switching from
tacrolimus to cyclosporine, the patient’s symptoms
improved within 5 months. His renal function was
maintained with an immunosuppressant regimen of
cyclosporine, prednisone and mycophenolic acid. The
prompt recognition of tacrolimus as a potential
neurotoxic drug in a patient with renal transplant and
substituting tacrolimus with a different
immunosuppressant may prevent permanent neurological
damage.
BACKGROUND
Tacrolimus, also known as FK 506, is a calcineurin
inhibitor and macrolide antibiotic that is frequently
used as an immunosuppressant following solid
organ transplantation. Use of tacrolimus for initial
immunosuppression in kidney transplant recipients
has increased from 25.9% in 1998 to 87.8% in
2009 (Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients
data 2010).1 Unfortunately, the use of tacrolimus
has been associated with moderate or even severe
neurological side effects. One uncommon side
effect of tacrolimus is peripheral neuropathy.
We report a case of tacrolimus-associated neuro￾toxicity due to tacrolimus overdose, manifesting as
mildly altered mental status and bilateral foot drop.
Electromyography and a nerve conduction study
confirmed demyelinating polyneuropathy affecting
the common peroneal nerves bilaterally. Recovery
of neurological function of the affected limbs
occurred 5 months after tacrolimus immunosup￾pression was discontinued and switched to
cyclosporine.
CASE PRESENTATION
The patient was a 69-year-old man with a medical
history significant for transient ischaemic attack,
coronary artery disease status post four coronary
stents, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined
significance and end-stage renal disease secondary
to hypertension. He received a living donor kidney
transplant from his daughter. The transplant was a
1-haplotype match with negative pre-transplant
flow cytometry cross matches. The patient’s early
post-transplant course was uneventful. The serum
creatinine improved to 1.23 mg/dL by 7 days post￾transplant. The patient did not receive any anti￾body induction therapy. He was immunosuppressed
with high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone for
the first 2 days (500 mg and then 250 mg), which
was then converted to oral prednisone at 30 mg
twice daily. He was also started on oral tacrolimus
(5 mg twice daily), with an initial trough goal of
8–12 ng/mL and mycophenolic acid (720 mg twice
daily). The prednisone was tapered by approxi￾mately 10 mg every week, with an eventual goal
maintenance dose of 5 mg daily.
Twenty days after transplantation, the patient was
seen for a routine follow-up visit in the transplant
clinic and was noted to be mildly confused with a
new-onset bilateral foot drop. The 12 h tacrolimus
trough level was 48.1 ng/mL. On further question￾ing, it was found that due to confusion, the patient
was inadvertently taking doses of the tacrolimus that
were much higher than prescribed. The tacrolimus
was then stopped. Five days later, the tacrolimus
level had decreased to 12.8 ng/mL. Eight days after
stopping, the tacrolimus was resumed in low doses
at 0.5 mg twice a day. The tacrolimus level then
ranged from 12.1 to 13.5 ng/mL. The patient’s foot
drop and confusion, however, worsened over the
next several days, and he fell several times at home.
Because of his worsening neurological status, the
patient was brought to the hospital by his family
and admitted for further evaluation, 30 days after
transplantation. On neurological examination, the
patient was alert, awake, oriented to person and
place but disoriented to time. Cranial nerve func￾tions were all preserved. The gait was unsteady due
to bilateral foot drop. Sensory examination was
normal. Muscle strength of arms, hands and prox￾imal lower extremities was normal. Weakness was
present in distal portion of both legs with marked
impairment in feet dorsiflexion (3/5 on both feet).
INVESTIGATIONS
Various tests were performed to rule out vascular
or metabolic causes of his confusion and foot drop.
CT of the head excluded acute bleeding, mass or
hydrocephalus. MRI of the brain showed chronic
microvascular ischaemic changes. Serum lead,
mercury, zinc, thyroid stimulating hormone,
vitamin B12 and B6 and folic acid levels were all

within normal limits. Hepatitis panel was negative. Serum
protein electrophoresis was consistent with acute inflammation
but had no M spike. Lumbar puncture showed that the opening
pressure was within normal range. Amounts of red blood cell,
white cell count, total protein and glucose in the cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF) were normal. CSF tests for Epstein-Barr virus, West
Nile virus, herpes simplex virus 6, Borrelia burgdorferi and acid￾fast bacilli by PCR were all negative. Lyme antibody (IgM and
IgG) and Venereal Disease Research Laboratory screen tests
were negative. CSF cultures, including fungal cultures, were also
negative. The electromyography and nerve conduction studies
were carried out 1 month later. These studies showed bilateral
common peroneal nerve demyelination.
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Although the patient’s serum tacrolimus level was high suggesting
tacrolimus toxicity, his symptoms did not improve with decreas￾ing the dose or temporarily holding the medication. Hence, we
explicitly tried to exclude other diagnoses, including infectious,
vascular, inflammatory or metabolic causes. Based on the clinical
picture and the laboratory investigations, we excluded infection,
vascular or metabolic reasons. The inflammatory causes included
acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, chronic
inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy and polyneurop￾athy due to renal disease or diabetes mellitus. The patient did not
have any acute event following transplantation that could have
caused acute inflammation or chronic inflammatory neuropathy.
The patient did not have diabetes mellitus before transplantation
nor a history of alcoholic abuse. Although the patient had a
history of kidney failure, he did not have any neuropathic
symptom prior to transplantation. His symptoms did improve
slowly after switching the tacrolimus to cyclosporine, and this
improvement supported the diagnosis of tacrolimus neurological
toxicity.
TREATMENT
Tacrolimus dose was reduced to 0.5 mg and the tacrolimus
trough level trended down to 3.4 ng/mL. Prednisone dose was
also reduced to 5 mg daily. However, the patient’s mental status
and foot drop barely improved. Therefore, the tacrolimus was
switched to cyclosporine 175 mg twice a day which was later
reduced to 50 mg twice a day on discharge. The cyclosporine
trough level ranged 127–187 ng/mL. The patient was discharged
at 37 days post-transplant to a rehabilitation facility, with bilat￾eral ankle foot orthoses.
OUTCOME AND FOLLOW-UP
One month after discharge, on follow-up examination, the
patient’s mental status had improved to his baseline level. By
approximately 5 months after stopping tacrolimus, the patient’s
foot drop had dramatically improved. He was able to walk
without any ankle foot orthoses. The serum creatinine level
remained in the range 1.1–1.3 mg/dL with an immunosuppres￾sant regimen of cyclosporine 50 mg twice a day, prednisone
5 mg daily and mycophenolic acid 720 mg twice a day.
DISCUSSION
Tacrolimus-induced neurological side effects
Between 25% and 31% of patients who receive tacrolimus
experience some form of neurotoxic adverse events.2 3
Approximately 20% of patients have mild neurotoxicity includ￾ing tremor (most common finding), insomnia, headache,
vertigo, dysaesthesia, photophobia and mood disturbance. They
tend to be most prominent shortly after transplantation. In one
prospective study of 294 patients, major neurological side
effects were identified in 16 (5.4%) of the patients. These side
effects generally occurred within the first 30 days following
transplantation and were related in many instances to high
plasma levels of tacrolimus.2
Peripheral neuropathy is rare but can be a severe side effect of
tacrolimus. About 3 of 1000 patients develop severe multifocal
demyelinating sensorimotor polyneuropathy 2–10 weeks after
initiation of tacrolimus therapy.4 Two patients with orthotopic
liver transplantation were reported developing motor axonopa￾thy with flaccid quadriparesis and hyporeflexia. The symptoms
resolved 5 days after reducing or stopping the tacrolimus.5
A retrospective study found two cases of disabling peripheral
neuropathy in 50 patients with orthotopic liver transplantation.
One patient had sensorimotor neuropathy prior to the trans￾plant which was getting worse after transplantation. The other
patient had a new-onset peripheral neuropathy post-transplant.
The tacrolimus level was in the normal range in both patients,
but the neurological symptoms and signs improved significantly
or recovered completely after stopping the tacrolimus.6
Risk factors for tacrolimus-induced neurotoxicity
In patients treated with cyclosporine, several factors appear to
increase the risk of neurotoxicity. Some of these factors include
advanced liver failure, hypertension, hypocholesterolaemia, ele￾vated drug blood levels, hypomagnesaemia, intravenous adminis￾tration of drug or administration of other drugs that inhibit
metabolism of the cyclosporine.7 Among patients on tacrolimus,
investigators did not find clear relationship between hypocholes￾terolaemia or hypomagnesaemia and neurotoxicity.2 But similar
effects such as intravenous administration of drug and blood drug
levels are showed in patients treated with tacrolimus. Cyclosporine
and tacrolimus are both substrates of CYP3A4, which plays an
important role in drug interactions. Azole antifungals, which are
CYP3A4 inhibitors, increase the blood level of cyclosporine and
tacrolimus. For example, itraconazole was reported to induce
cyclosporine neurotoxicity.8 Nefazodone, a substrate of CYP3A4,
also increases the tacrolimus level and was reported to induce
encephalopathy in a renal transplant recipient.9
Tacrolimus-induced neurotoxicity in renal transplantation
The risk of neurotoxicity from tacrolimus may vary according
to the type of solid organ transplant received. Major neuro￾logical side effects are much more common in liver transplant￾ation than in heart or lung transplantation (3.6%).2 10 They are
rare in renal transplantation. One literature review study
reported eight leukoencephalopathy cases in renal transplant￾ation.10 In few single case reports, tacrolimus-induced severe
central nervous system or peripheral nervous system toxicity in
adult or paediatric renal transplantation were reported.11–13
Pathogenesis
The cellular basis for neurotoxicity associated with tacrolimus
has not been conclusively identified. It may have a common
mechanism with cyclosporine based on their similar characteris￾tics including imaging findings with CT and MRI.14 Both tacro￾limus and cyclosporine mediate their immunosuppressive effects
via inhibition of calcineurin. This inhibition provokes a com￾plete block off in the translocation of the cytosolic component
of the nuclear factor of activated T cells, resulting in a failure to
activate the genes regulated by the nuclear factor of activated
T-cells transcription factor. Tacrolimus and cyclosporine can
decrease the expression of p-glycoprotein, as drug efflux pump,
in brain endothelial cell and cause the dysfunction of the blood–

brain barrier which results in vasogenic oedema. Prolonged
exposure also leads to apoptosis of capillary endothelial cells.15
Patients treated with cyclosporine and tacrolimus have nerve
membrane depolarisation which may reduce the threshold for
action potential generation and facilitate the development of
neuropathic symptoms, including paresthesias and cramps.16
However, at least one study showed that neurotoxicity improved
after switching the tacrolimus to cyclosporine in 19 of 23
patients with persistent neurotoxicity.17 Also six patients were
converted back to tacrolimus because of ongoing rejection,
retransplantation or persistent nausea and vomiting without a
recurrence of the original neurological complication. It implied
that a mechanism other than common calcineurin inhibition
also took important effect on neurotoxicity. In the cases
described by Wilson et al, the improvement of symptoms fol￾lowed by plasmapheresis or intravenous immunoglobulin sug￾gesting an immune-mediated cause. The immune-mediated
demyelination may be related to enhanced T-cell activation by
tacrolimus or elevated T cells reacting with autoantigens by
altering T-cell subsets.4 Allergic neuritis induced by low dose of
cyclosporine A has a similar effect on T cell subsets to
tacrolimus.18
TREATMENT
In patients with neurotoxicity from tacrolimus, there are several
treatment options. First, the tacrolimus dose can be reduced.
Some patients, like ours, do not improve despite such dose
reduction. Second, the patient can be switched to a different cal￾cineurin inhibitor, such as cyclosporine. In our patient, convert￾ing from tacrolimus to cyclosporine resulted in slow
improvement of his symptoms. Third, the patient can be con￾verted to a calcineurin inhibitor-free immunosuppressive
regimen. For example, the tacrolimus can be switched to siroli￾mus or everolimus or the patient can receive monthly infusion
of belatacept.6 13 19
Switching from tacrolimus to cyclosporine can also improve
the tacrolimus-induced neurological adverse effects, even
though tacrolimus and cyclosporine have common immunosup￾pressive mechanisms as aforementioned. Tacrolimus has a differ￾ent chemical structure from cyclosporine. Switching to
cyclosporine would allow the clearance of tacrolimus and its
metabolites. At the same time cyclosporine can still provide
adequate immunosuppression to prevent allograft rejection.
Neoral is the microemulsion formulation of cyclosporine which
has pharmacological advantages over conventional cyclosporine
in terms of more reliable and consistent absorption, particularly
its absorption in the absence of bile.17
CONCLUSION
The prompt recognition of tacrolimus as a potentially neuro￾toxic drug and substituting it with a different immunosuppres￾sant can prevent permanent damage and decrease the risk of
rejection. Cyclosporine and tacrolimus are both calcineurin inhi￾bitors sharing the same immunosuppressive pathway.
Nevertheless, some cases of tacrolimus neurotoxicity may
improve when the tacrolimus is switched to cyclosporine. In
summary, neurological complications in patients receiving tacro￾limus that fail to improve after a reduction in dosage can be
managed safely with cyclosporine.

Learning points
▸ Tacrolimus-induced encephalopathy and peripheral
neuropathy presenting with confusion and bilateral foot drop
is rare in patients who underwent renal transplantation.
▸ The diagnosis of tacrolimus neurotoxicity should exclude
other neuropathies caused by vascular, infectious,
inflammatory or metabolic reasons.
▸ Reducing the dosage, temporarily holding the dose of
tacrolimus, switching to cyclosporine or calcineurin
inhibitor-free immunosuppressant are the treatment options,
which can prevent permanent damage and decrease the risk
of rejection.
