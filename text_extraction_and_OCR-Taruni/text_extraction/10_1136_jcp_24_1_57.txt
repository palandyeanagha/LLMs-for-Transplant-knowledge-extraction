Part I A clinico-pathological study of 76 cases
SYNOPSIS The clinical and pathological findings in 150 children submitted to partial or total
nephrectomy have been reviewed. Histological examination of the kidney removed at operation
showed evidence of renal dysplasia in 76 (51 %). These 76 patients were divided into three
main groups on the basis of the pathological changes found in the kidney and the associated
urinary tract anomalies. In group 1, gross cystic renal dysplasia was associated with absence
or atresia of the renal pelvis and ureter. In group 2, renal dysplasia was segmental; the ureter,
although patent, had some anatomical or functional abnormality which resulted in urinary
stasis or reflux. In many of these patients dysplasia was confined to the upper pole of a
'duplex' kidney which was drained by an ectopic ureterocele. In group 3, renal dysplasia was
associated with obstruction of the lower urinary tract, most commonly by posterior urethral
valves. In group 1 dysplasia was total, involving the whole kidney, whilst in groups 2 and 3
dysplasia tended to be segmental; in the majority some normal renal tissue was present.
Pyelonephritis was a very common complication, but was present only in patients from groups
2 and 3, in whom a lumen was present in the draining ureter, and not in patients from group 1
in whom the ureter was atretic or absent, and the kidney not functioning. It appears that
urinary obstruction, stasis, or reflux are the principal factors predisposing to and promoting
pyelonephritis in dysplastic kidneys. There seems to be no reason to suppose that dysplastic
renal tissue is abnormally susceptible to infection since pyelonephritic changes were lacking
in those cases in which dysplasia was most severe.
Renal dysplasia is the abnormal, disorganized
development of renal parenchyma due to anom￾alous differentiation of metanephric tissue.
Histologically the normal renal architecture is
distorted; the glomeruli, tubules, and collecting
ducts are deficient in number, appear morpho￾logically immature, and often undergo cystic
changes (Kissane, 1966). The extent of the
abnormality varies from a grossly disorganized
multicystic dysplasia involving the whole kidney
to a less severe segmental change in which part of
the kidney is unaffected. Osathanondh and
Potter (1964), in a study of the pathogenesis of
polycystic kidneys based on microdissection,
concluded that cystic dysplasia was due to

diminished branching of the ampullary portion
of collecting ducts derived from the ureteric bud,
with resulting cyst formation and failure to
induce normal nephron formation in the meta￾nephric blastema. The cause of inhibition of
ampullary activity in these cases is unknown, but
it has been suggested that the frequent association
of urinary tract obstruction may be an important
factor (Bernstein, 1968). The present study was
undertaken in order to assess the frequency of
renal dysplasia in kidneys surgically resected in
children and to correlate the clinical and patho￾logical changes found. Pyelonephritis compli￾cating renal dysplasia was found to be confined
to those cases in which the lumen of the draining
ureter was patent.

Patients
The pathological material has been reviewed
from 150 consecutive cases of children submitted
to total or partial nephrectomy at the Hospital
for Sick Chilcren between 1962 and 1969. The
case records of these children were also examined
in order to correlate the clinical and histopatho￾logical findings. Seventy-three were boys and 77
girls, ranging in age between 1 week and 12 years
6 months at the time of operation. The kidney
tissue removed was fixed in buffered formalin
(pH 7-0) and between one and five blocks of
tissue from each specimen were embedded in
paraffin wax. Sections of 5 , thickness were cut
and stained routinely by Ehrlich's haemotoxylin
and eosin (H & E) and, in the majority of cases,
by van Gieson's mixture. Other stains were also
used when necessary.
The patients fell into six categories (Table I).
The main clinical findings and pathological
R. A. Risdon
abnormalities, particularly the associated anom￾alies found in the ureters and lower urinary
tracts, are shown. 'Hypoplastic' kidneys were
congenitally small; the five examples examined
all weighed less than 9 g. Gross multicystic
kidneys were those in which the kidney consisted
of a disorderly non-reniform mass of cysts of
varying size, in which no normal renal paren￾chyma was recognizable. Partially cystic kidneys
were those in which the structural disorganization
and cystic change was somewhat less marked and
in which some renal parenchyma was present.
Assessment of the Histological Changes
In each case the histological sections were
examined for evidence of renal dysplasia and
pyelonephritis.

Renal dysplasia: A clinico-pathological study of 76 cases
depended primarily upon disorganization of the
renal parenchyma, and the presence of 'primitive'
ducts. These structures are lined by columnar
epithelium and surrounded by concentric mantles
of cellular mesenchyme (Fig. 1). They are thought
to be derived from the branches of the ureteric
bud (Ericsson and Ivemark, 1958a). Often they
are aggregated, forming nodular collections
(Fig. 2). A case was classified as dysplastic only
when these features were present. Foci of
metaplastic cartilage (Fig. 3) were also regarded
as definite evidence of renal dysplasia, but these
were present in only a proportion of the cases
showing parenchymal disorganization and
'primitive' ducts. Other so-called 'dysplastic'
structures sought were 'foetal' glomeruli (Paster￾nack, 1960), 'primitive' tubules and ductules
(Ericsson and Ivemark, 1958a), and tubular and
glomerular cysts (Rubenstein, Meyer, and Bern￾stein, 1961). These are illustrated in Figures 4
and 5.
PYELONEPHRITIS
Histological evidence of pyelonephritis sought
was the presence of conspicuous acute or chronic
inflammation of the renal interstitial tissues and
of the mucosa lining the renal pelvis (Figs. 6 and
7). Periglomerular fibrosis, glomerular sclerosis,
and foci of tubular atrophy (Fig. 8) were almost
invariably present in the inflamed areas.
Results
These are summarized in Tables II, III, and IV
and in Figure 10.
Histological evidence of renal dysplasia was
present in 76 (51 %) of the 150 patients studied
(Table II). These 76 patients were divided into
three main groups (Table III) on the basis of the
pathological changes found in the kidneys and
the associated anomalies in the urinary tract.

evidence of this condition was present in 58
(76%), but was found only in patients in groups
2 and 3 (Table IV). Two patients in group 1 had
clinical evidence of urinary tract infection (pyuria
and bacteriuria) but in both the opposite kidney
was abnormal; in one intravenous pyelography
showed a small kidney with clubbed calyces, and
in the other hydronephrosis due to stenosis of the
pelvi-ureteric junction was found.
The blood urea concentration, which in each
case was measured a few days before operation,
was often raised in all three groups (Fig. 9).
In group 1 the urea concentration was normal or
moderately raised in all but two cases in which
the levels were more markedly raised (141 and
153 mg/100 ml). In these instances there were
marked abnormalities in the opposite kidney. In
group 2, one case had a urea level of 150 mg/100

the remainder the initial urea level was often
raised, but in every case fell to less than 35
mg/100 ml following operation. In group 3 the
blood urea was usually raised and was less than
40 mg/100 ml in only six cases.
Mortality was highest amongst patients in
group 3, five of whom died ofrenal failure between
three weeks and 30 months after operation. In
group 1, one patient died of renal failure. This
child had severe hydronephrosis of the contra￾lateral kidney due to stenosis of the pelvi-ureteric
junction. In group 2, one child died in the post￾operative period. He had severe bilateral
hydronephrosis due to an obstructing ectopic
ureterocele in the urinary bladder.
Discussion
The criteria on which the histological identifi￾cation of renal dysplasia is based are unsatis￾factory. The diagnosis depends on the recognition
of various 'dysplastic' structures in the kidney
including 'primitive' ducts and tubules (Ericsson
and Ivemark, 1958a), metaplastic cartilage

(Bigler and Killingsworth, 1949), 'foetal' glom￾eruli (Pasternack, 1960), and renal cysts (Ruben￾stein et al, 1961). However, Bernstein (1968) has
demonstrated in the kidneys of young children
that an apparently 'primitive' morphology may
be induced in glomeruli, tubules, and ductules as
a result of ischaemic damage, or even by scarring
following renal biopsy, without there being any
suggestion of maldevelopment. For these reasons,
in the present study, the histological diagnosis
was based on the presence of structural dis￾organization of the renal parenchyma as a result
of abnormal development, and on the presence of
'primitive' ducts of the type described by
Ericsson and Ivemark. These structures are
thought to represent branches of the ureteric bud,
and are not seen in conditions other than renal
dysplasia (Bernstein, 1968). Bars of metaplastic
cartilage have also been regarded as definite
evidence of renal dysplasia (Bigler and Killings￾worth, 1949), but since they are not always present
even in obviously dysplastic kidneys, their
presence was regarded more as useful con￾firmation of the diagnosis. Dysplastic changes
may sometimes be confused with those due to
hydronephrosis, particularly when the two con￾Fig. 10 Hydronephrosis. Flattening of the renal

ditions coexist. Flattening of the renal papillae
as a result of back pressure causes a tangential
rather than a radial alignment of the collecting
ducts. The ducts become separated by fibrous
connective tissue which may condense around
the tubules and mimic mantles of mesenchyme
(Fig. 10). Such cases may account for descriptions
of so-called pure medullary dysplasia (Gwinn
and Landing, 1968). In the cases studied it was
usually evident that hydronephrosis primarily
produced atrophic changes in the medulla, the
cortex becoming thin only at a late stage. In renal
dysplasia the cortex was disorganized and usually
markedly thinned by comparison with the
adjacent medulla. 'Primitive' ducts were often
aggregated together and formed nodules (Fig.
2), a feature not seen in pure hydronephrosis.
In the present series, histological evidence of
renal dysplasia was found in 51 % of cases.
Consideration of the pathological changes in
the kidneys and the associated urinary tract
abnormalities allowed their division into three
groups (Table III). In group 2 cases of 'duplex'
kidney with double ureters were included with
cases in which the kidneys were 'hypoplastic' or
partially cystic. This was considered reasonable,

since in all the dysplastic changes were segmental,
and in all the ureter draining the dysplastic
kidney, whilst possessing a lumen, showed some
structural or functional abnormality which result￾ed in urinary stasis or reflux.
Elevation of the blood urea concentration was
seen in a proportion of patients from all three
groups, but was most common in those in group
3 with obstruction of the lower urinary tract.
In fact, in most cases in group 3 the initial blood
urea level had been higher, but the establishment
of bilateral ureterostomies or nephrostomies
produced a fall in the blood urea. Nephrectomies
were performed when urine formation was so
slight as to suggest little useful renal function.
In all cases in group 2 with raised blood urea
concentrations, ectopic ureteroceles (Berdon,
Baker, Becker, and Uson, 1968) were present in the
urinary bladder. The fact that urea levels fell
after operation suggests that the initial elevation
may have been due to urinary obstruction by the
ureterocele. In group 1, the blood urea levels
were markedly raised in two cases in which
abnormalities were also present in the contra￾lateral kidney and moderately raised (57 and
74 mg %) in two others. Both of these were young
infants, less than 2 weeks old. The raised blood
urea level in these cases may reflect a relative
inability of the opposite 'normal' kidney to cope
as a result of some functional immaturity.
The mortality was highest in patients in group
3, five of whom died of renal failure. This was
not surprising since they all presented with
bilateral hydronephrosis and hydroureters and
the resulting renal damage was sufficient to
destroy entirely the function in at least one
kidney.
Pyelonephritis was a very common compli￾cation in those patients with renal dysplasia.
Histological evidence of pyelonephritis was
found in 76% of the cases. This association has
also been emphasized by others (Marshall, 1953;
Ericsson and Ivemark, 1958b; Pasternack, 1960).
These authors concluded that dysplastic renal
tissue was abnormally susceptible to infection in
much the same way as areas of scar tissue in the
kidney (Rocha, Guze, Freedman, and Beeson,
1958). Marshall (1968) even suggested that most
cases of pyelonephritis in the adult arise from
infection of areas of renal dysplasia. In the
present study, although pyelonephritis was
common, it occurred only in patients in groups
2 and 3 in whom a lumen was present in the
draining ureter, and not in group 1 in whom the
ureter was absent or atretic, and the kidney was
not functioning. Two patients in group 1 had
R. A. Risdoni
clinical evidence of a urinary tract infection, but
in both there were marked abnormalities of the
opposite kidney. Such a finding is not uncommon
in cases of cystic renal dysplasia (Pathak and
Williams, 1964). In both these cases histological
evidence of pyelonephritis was lacking in the
resected dysplastic kidney. In any case, pyuria and
bacteruria in the voided urine could hardly have
arisen in this kidney since it was effectively
isolated by an atretic ureter.
It appears that a lumen is necessaryin the drain￾ing ureter for infecting organisms to gain access
to the dysplastic kidney. Structural or functional
abnormalities in the ureter or lower urinary tract
causing urinary stasis or reflux seem to be the
most important factors in promoting pyelo￾nephritis in dysplastic kidneys as in other situ￾ations. There is no reason to conclude that
dysplastic renal tissue is abnormally prone to
infection since pyelonephritis was absent in those
cases in group 1 in which dysplasia was most
widespread and severe. Absence or atresia of
ureter in these cases may be a secondary phenom￾enon. Dysplasia was marked and affected the
whole kidney and it seems unlikely that urine
formation could have occurred at any stage in its
development. It is possible that the maintenance
of a lumen in the developing ureter requires the
passage of urine and in its absence the lumen
either does not develop or even the ureter may
disappear.

Part II A necropsy study of 41 cases
SYNOPSIS The pathological findings at necropsy have been reviewed in 121 children with
congenital malformations of the kidney and lower urinary tract. Histological examination of
the kidneys revealed evidence of renal dysplasia in 41 (34%). Comparison of these 41 cases
with other cases in which renal dysplasia was found in kidneys removed surgically showed a
much higher incidence of bilateral involvement and of other associated major congenital
abnormalities. Histological evidence of pyelonephritis was less common except in those cases
in which renal dysplasia was associated with lower urinary tract obstruction. A total of 34
children with bilateral hydronephrosis and hydroureters due to congenital urethral obstruction
was found, and in these cases severe degrees
dying in the first two months.
Many previous reviews have been made of
multicystic and 'hypoplastic' renal dysplasia
(Elkstrom, 1955; Spence, 1955; Coppridge and
Ratliff, 1958; Parkkulainen, Hjelt, and Sirola,
1959; Vellios and Garrett, 1961) but rather less
emphasis has been given to renal dysplasia
associated with congenital lower urinary tract
obstruction (Pathak and Williams, 1964; Rattner,
Meyer, and Bernstein, 1963). For this reason a
separate quantitative study was made of the
incidence and degree of renal dysplasia presentin
the 34 children with obstruction of the lower
urinary tract included in the present series.
Patients
A review of the necropsy records at the Hospital
for Sick Children for the period between 1954
and 1969 revealed 157 congenital malformations
of the kidney and lower urinary tract occurring
in 121 children. Eighty-four were boys and 37
girls ranging between 1 day and 13 years 6 months
at death. The various anomalies encountered are
shown in Table I. In each case histological sections
from the kidneys were examined. Blocks of
kidney tissue had been fixed in buffered formalin
(pH 7 0) and embedded in paraffin wax. Sections
of renal dysplasia were present only in those
were cut of 5 ,u and stained routinely by Ehrlich's
haematoxylin and eosin (H and E); other stains
were employed where necessary.

examined for evidence of renal dysplasia and
pyelonephritis using the criteria described pre￾viously (Risdon, 1970).
In addition a separate quantitative assessment
of the degree of renal dysplasia present in the
kidneys from the 34 children with bliateral
hydronephrosis and hydroureters due to con￾genital lower urinary tract obstruction was made
as follows: 0 = where there was no histological
evidence of renal dysplasia. + = where occasion￾al foci of renal dysplasia were seen, but most of
the renal parenchyma was normally differentiated
(Fig. 1). + + = where renal dysplasia was seg￾mental, with areas of normally and anomalously
differentiated parenchyma present (Fig. 2).
+ + + = where renal dysplasia was total, but
some separation of the renal parenchyma into
cortex and medulla was discernible. Cystic
changes tended to be prominent in the sub￾capsular zone (Fig. 3). + + + + = where dys￾plasia was total and complete disorganization of
the renal parenchyma was associated with
marked cystic changes (Fig. 4).
In 33 of the 34 cases sections from both
kidneys were examined. In the remaining case,
unilateral renal agenesis was present, and a
section from the single kidney was examined.
Results
Histological evidence of renal dysplasia was
present in 41 (34%) of the cases studied and was
bilateral in just over half of them (23 cases).
The 41 children with renal dysplasia were
divided into three groups (Table II) on the basis
of the pathological changes in the kidney and the
associated anomalies in the draining urinary
tract as described previously (Risdon, 1970).
Dysplasia was bilateral in 23 (63 %) and
additional congenital abnormalities were fre￾quently present both in the urogenital system and
also in other systems, particularly the cardio￾vascular and gastrointestinal systems. These are
summarized in Table Ill.
Histological evidence of renal infection or
pyelonephritis was present in two of nine cases
from group 1, three of the 10 cases from group 2,
and in 17 of the 22 cases from group 3.
Of the two cases affected in group 1, in the
first, evidence of pyelonephritis was confined to
the contralateral non-dysplastic kidney, in which
there was hydronephrosis due to mid-ureteric
obstruction. In the other case, there was focal
abscess formation in the cystic dysplastic kidney
and a pyonephrosis in the other kidney due to
pelvi-ureteric stenosis. In group 2, the three cases

Discussion
In the previous account of renal dysplasia
in surgically resected kidneys in children (part
I) the cases were divided into three main groups
according to the pathological changes in the
kidney and the associated anomalies in the
draining urinary tract. Group 1 comprised cases
of gross multicystic renal dysplasia associated
with absence or atresia of the ureter and renal
pelvis (Fig. 6). In group 2 renal dysplasia was
segmental, and the draining ureter, whilst it
possessed a lumen, showed some structural or
functional abnormality which interfered with
urinary drainage (Figs. 7 and 8). In group 3,
renal dysplasia was associated with bilateral
hydronephrosis and hydroureter due to lower

urinary tract obstruction (Fig. 9). A similargroup￾ing was used to classify the cases in the present
survey of postmortem cases, and this emphasized
important differences in the relative incidence of
cases placed in the various groups in the two
series. In two cases of unilateral multicystic
dysplasia discovered at necropsy, the draining
ureter, although grossly narrowed and hypo￾plastic, was not entirely atretic. These cases were
included in group 1 because the changes in the
kidney were entirely similar to the other cases in
the group in that the cystic changes were gross
and no normal renal parenchyma was discernible.
Four cases included in group 3 in the postmortem
series had congenital absence of the abdominal
muscles, and were examples of the so-called
'prune belly' syndrome (McGovern and Marshall,
1959). All four had bilateral hydronephrosis and
hydroureters and severe renal dysplasia. In three
there was urethral obstruction due to urethral
atresia or stenosis, but in the fourth case, although
the posterior urethra was dilated, no definite
mechanical obstruction was demonstrated. In￾clusion of this case in group 3 seemed justified,
since in all other respects the findings were
indistinguishable.
Amongst the surgical cases, the numerically
largest category were those in group 2 with
'duplex' kidneys in which the upper pole was
dysplastic. Only one such case was present in the
necropsy series. In the whole survey of post￾mortem cases there were 11 instances cf 'double
kidneys' with pelvic duplication, but in none of
these was there any parenchymal dysplasia. It is
of interest that in all of these the double ureters
fused -to -forma- single structure-before- insertion
into the bladder, and the ureteric orifice was
normally situated in the trigone. In contrast,
'duplex' kidneys with dysplasia of the upper pole
invariably had two separate ureters draining the
upper and lower poles. In every case fully investi￾gated the ureter draining the dysplastic pole was
inserted ectopically into the bladder, and in the
majority of cases this was associated with a
ureterocele (Berdon, Baker, Becker, and Uson,
1968).
Cases of congenitally small 'hypoplastic'
dysplastic kidneys, and partially cystic dysplastic
kidneys placed in group 2, were slightly more
common in the postmortem series. As in the
surgical cases, structural abnormalities of the
draining ureter were almost universal, being
present in all but one case. The ureteric abnor￾malities were similar, and included ectopic
insertion into the bladder, ureterocele, ureteric
dilatation without obstruction, and ureteric
hypoplasia.
In contrast to the surgical series in which all
the cases placed in groups 1 and 2 had unilateral
renal dysplasia, seven of the 19 postmortem cases
in groups 1 and 2 showed bilateral involvement.
In addition there were major congenital abnor￾malities in other systems in 10 instances. These
anomalies, which are summarized in Table Ill,
principally involved the cardiovascular and
gastrointestinal systems, a finding also noted by
Rubenstein, Meyer, and Bernstein (1961). These
findings in groups 1 and 2 constituted the main
difference between the surgical and necropsy
series. Involvement of both kidneys or the pres￾ence of other major and often multiple congenital
abnormalities were not compatible with survival.
In three of the cases placed in groups 1 and 2
in the necropsy series there was hydronephrosis
of the contralateral kidney due to ureteric
stenosis. In two the stenosis was at the pelvi￾ureteric junction and in the third the stenosis was
at the junction of the upper and middle thirds of
the ureter. Similar findings were present in two
of the surgical cases. This type of abnormality in
the opposite kidney is an important and not
uncommon finding in cases of multicystic renal
dysplasia, as has been emphasized by Pathak and
Williams (1964). Early diagnosis of the contra￾69

lateral hydronephrosis is vital if progressive
destruction by back-pressure and ascending
infection is to be avoided in this single functional
kidney.
The pattern of secondary pyelonephritis
differed somewhat between the surgical and the
necropsy series. None of the surgically resected
dysplastic kidneys placed in group 1 showed
histological evidence of pyelonephritis. Of the
cases in group I found at necropsy, one case
showed evidence of infection in the dysplastic
kidney; scattered abscess formation and focal
pyogenic inflammation were present. However,
in this case infection was clearly blood-borne,
since a pyonephrosis due to pelvi-ureteric
obstruction was found in the opposite kidney.
This was the only instance of infection in a
multicystic dysplastic kidney in the 23 cases in
both series in which the draining ureter was
atretic or absent. This finding emphasizes the
importance of ascending infection in the patho￾genesis of pyelonephritis complicating renal
dysplasia (Risdon, 1970). Histological evidence of
pyelonephritis was less common in the cases in
group 2 in the present series, only three of the 10
cases being affected, whereas all but one of the 45
surgical cases in this group showed pyelo￾nephritic changes. This discrepancy probably
reflects the difference in ages in the two series.
The three cases in group 2 in the necropsy series
were all aged 6 weeks or more at the time of
death whereas the seven without pyelonephritic
changes were aged 19 days or less. These seven
cases all had either bilateral renal dysplasia or
other major congenital abnormalities, these
factors being responsible for their early death.
In all the cases found at necropsy to have
bilateral hydronephrosis and hydroureters due
to congenital lower urinary tract obstruction,
including the cases of 'prune belly' syndrome,
death had resulted from renal failure. This was
variously due to a combination of pyelonephritis,
renal atrophy due to hydronephrosis, and renal
dysplasia. In order to assess the importance of
renal dysplasia in this context, quantitative
assessment was made in all cases of the degree of
renal dysplasia in sections from both kidneys.
Histological changes of renal dysplasia were
found in 22 (65%) of the 34 cases, and was
bilateral in 16. This compares with an incidence
of 10 out of 21 (eight bilateral) in a similar
necropsy survey by Rattner et al (1963). Apart
from the six cases in which only one kidney
showed dysplastic changes, quantitative assess￾ment showed that the degree of renal dysplasia
present often varied in the two kidneys. In three
71
instances severe renal dysplasia was present in
one kidney and absent in the contralateral kidney.
The occurrence of such marked variation in the
degree of dysplasia in the two kidneys probably
explains the much higher incidence of renal
dysplasia in the surgical cases with congenital
lower urinary tract obstruction, all but one of
which were affected. In these, unilateral neph￾rectomy was performed to remove a non-function￾ing kidney. They were, therefore, highly selected
in terms of disparate function on the two sides,
and renal dysplasia might reasonably be expected
to be commoner in the resected organ. Corre￾lation of the age at death in the cases in this group
coming to necropsy with the degree of renal
dysplasia found in the kidneys showed that severe
degrees of dysplasia were associated with early
death, before the age of 2 months. Treatment
of ascending infection and relief of the obstruc￾tion should not be expected to affect the outcome
when both kidneys are severely deformed, but,
as Rattner and his colleagues have emphasized,
in other cases early diagnosis with surgical
intervention and treatment of infection may be
successful in preventing further progressive renal
damage.
I should like to thank Professor A. E. Claireaux
and Mr D. I. Williams for their helpful advice
and criticism in the preparation of this paper. I
am also indebted to Mr D. I. Williams for per￾mission to use the clinical records of the cases
studied.
