Abstract Introduction
Two classes of receptors for IgG, FcyRlla and FcyRIIIb,
both of which exist in two allelic forms, are expressed on
human neutrophils. Neutrophils from normal donors, ho￾mozygous for the different allelic phenotypes of FcyRIJ~b,
have significantly different levels of Fcy receptor-mediated
phagocytosis of IgG-opsonized erythrocytes (EA). However,
the observation that FcyRMb mediates phagocytosis of spe￾cific mAb-targeted erythrocytes poorly suggests that this
receptor may influence EA internalization by Fc~yRla in
an allele-sensitive fashion. Donors homozygous for the NAt
allele of FcyRIb showed greater activation of FcyRIIa
after FcyRIIIb cross-linking than donors homozygous for
the NA2 allele of FcyRlb. This increase in receptor-spe￾cific internalization reflects both an increase in ligand bind￾ing by FcyRlla and an increase in internalization efficiency
of targets bound. Activation of FcyRlla by FcyRIllb is
transferable by supernatants from activated cells and is
blocked by inhibitors of reactive oxygen species and the
H202-myeloperoxidase-chloride system and by serine pro￾tease inhibitors. Thus, cross-linking of FcyRIllb, which
leads to neutrophil degranulation and the generation of re￾active oxygen intermediates, in turn alters FcyRIIa avidity
and efficiency. These oxidant-mediated changes in FcyRIa
function provide a novel mechanism for receptors to collab￾orate in both an autocrine and paracrine fashion. The allele
sensitivity of these effects suggests that Fcy receptor poly￾morphisms may be inherited disease susceptibility factors
in host defense against infection and in the development of
autoimmunity. (J. Clin. Invest. 1995. 95:2877-2885.) Key

Receptors for the Fc region of IgG, FcyR,' provide the crucial
link between humoral immunity and the IgG-triggered effector
functions by inflammatory cells. Three families of human FcyR
(FcyRI, FcyRH, and FcyRllI) have been identified. Within
these FcyR families, multiple distinct genes and alternative
splicing variants lead to a variety of receptor isoforms that have
differences in structure and distinct functional capacities (for
reviews see references 1-4). In addition to this diversity, two
receptor isoforms found on phagocytic cells have codominantly
expressed, allelic polymorphisms-the NAl and NA2 alleles of
FcyRII~b and the HR-LR alleles of FcyRHa-which influence
FcyR function.
Neutrophils from normal donors, homozygous for the two
different allelic phenotypes of FcyRIIIb, have significantly dif￾ferent levels of Fcy receptor-mediated phagocytosis indepen￾dent of the allelic phenotype of the second type of Fcy receptor
on neutrophils, FcyRIIa (5). Because experiments using antire￾ceptor mAb-targeted erythrocytes indicate that FcyRIIIb medi￾ates phagocytosis poorly (6), the importance of FcyRIIIb
NA phenotype in quantitative EA phagocytosis implies that a
model of "one receptor-one function" is inadequate and that
FcyRIIIb may collaborate interactively with other receptors.
Among the different paradigms of receptor cooperation, there
may be physical association of receptors that enhances binding
and signaling and interaction independent of physical associa￾tion. For example, the IL-2 receptor can assemble multiple dis￾tinct receptor chains into a complex, and different combinations
of a, P, and y chains have distinct binding and signaling capaci￾ties (7, 8). Similarly, TGFP signals through a heteromeric com￾plex composed of receptor I and receptor II, but a separate
nonsignaling TGF/3-binding membrane protein (TGFP receptor
type Ill) captures the ligand and delivers it to the signaling
complex (9). In contrast to these systems, signaling through
the T cell receptor upregulates the avidity of CD2 for CD58
(LFA-1) through inside-out signaling requiring specific do￾mains of the CD2 cytoplasmic tail (10, 11). Similarly, activa￾tion of 62 and #3 integrins as a consequence of receptor phos￾phorylation is induced by cross-linking other classes of recep￾tors (12-14). Even quantitative surface receptor expression of
one receptor may be modified by cross-linking other receptors
(15, 16).
Given these precedents for receptor interactions and the
suggestion that cross-linking of FcyRIIb with antireceptor
mAb F(ab ' )2 might augment the phagocytic activity of FcyRIIa
that has been engaged independently (17), we sought evidence
that FcyRIIb can augment FcyRlIa-specific function and deter￾mined the basis for this effect. Taking advantage of the NAl -
NA2 polymorphism as a model system to demonstrate that
quantitative augmentation varies with differences in the primary
structure of FcyRIIIb, we have shown that cross-linking of

FcyRIllb directly leads to activation of FcyRlla, a property
that can be transferred in supernatants to other neutrophils and
that can be blocked by inhibitors of reactive oxygen species
and serine proteases. Through coordinate degranulation and
generation of reactive oxygen species, FcyRIIIb elicits a cell
program that can rapidly activate receptors on both the same
and adjacent cells. This novel, oxidant-dependent interaction
provides an efficient mechanism for amplification of Fcy recep￾tor function in neutrophils.
Methods
Subjects. Peripheral blood was collected from 32 disease-free volunteers
who ranged in age from 20 to 56 yr (34±8 yr, mean±SD). Protocols
for these studies were approved by the Institutional Committee on Hu￾man Rights in Research.
Determination of FcyRIIIb and FcyRIIa alleles. Determination of
FcyRHlb alleles, NAl and NA2, was performed by leukoagglutination
as described previously (5). The assignment of NA type was confirmed
by immunoprecipitation and flow cytometry with mAbs CLB-FcR gran
1, CLB-gran 11, and GRM1 (18, 19). Phenotyping of donors for the
LR-HR alleles of FcyRIa was performed by quantitative flow cytome￾try using mAbs 41.H16 and IV.3 as described previously (20, 21).
Phenotypic assignment was corroborated by anti-CD3 mitogenesis
assays.
Reagents. HBSS, RPMI-1640, and IgG-free FCS were from GIBCO
Laboratories (Grand Island, NY). FCS was heat inactivated at 56°C for
60 min. Phorbol dibutyrate (PDBu), catalase, superoxide dismutase
(SOD), aminotriazole, p-aminobenzamidine (PABA), sodium azide,
and N0-tosyl-L-lysyl-chloromethyl ketone (TLCK) were purchased
from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). Sulfo-NHS-biotin, NHS￾LC-biotin, and streptavidin were obtained from Pierce Chemical Co.
(Rockford, IL).
Anti-FcyR mAbs IV.3 (anti-FcyRll, CD32 [22]), and 3G8 (anti￾FcyRIH, CD16 [23]) IgG, Fab fragments, or F(ab')2 were purchased
from Medarex, Inc. (Annandale, NJ). Anti-CD16 mAb Leul lb (IgM)
and anti-CD35 mAb Ell F(ab')2 were obtained form Becton Dickin￾son & Co. (Mountain View, CA) and Research Diagnostics Inc. (Flan￾ders, NJ), respectively. Anti-CD16 mAb 286.5 (24) was generously
provided by Dr. Howard B. Fleit (Stony Brook, NY), and F(ab')2
fragments were prepared by digestion with ficin according to the manu￾facturer's specifications (Pierce Chemical Co.). Silver stain analysis of
SDS-PAGE gels of all Fab fragments and F(ab' )2 preparations indicated
that there was no intact IgG. Purified human IgG2 myeloma proteins
(hIgG2) were obtained from The Binding Site, Inc. (San Diego, CA).
Anti-CDllb/CD18 mAb IB4 (IgG2a, anti-CD18) and IB4 F(ab')2
were generously provided by Irene Graham (Washington University,
St. Louis, MO) (25), and mAb MN41 (IgGl, anti-CDllb) was a gift
from Jill Buyon (Hospital for Joint Diseases, New York) (26). Murine
IgGl, isotype control for the flow cytometry studies, was obtained from
Sigma Chemical Co. Phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated goat anti-mouse
IgG F(ab')2 and FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-human IgG F(ab')2 was
purchased from Tago Immunochemicals (Burlingame, CA).
Preparation of cells. Fresh anticoagulated human peripheral blood
was separated by centrifugation through a discontinuous two step Ficoll￾Hypaque gradient (5). Neutrophils (PMNs) were isolated from the
lower interface and washed with HBSS. Contaminating erythrocytes
were lysed with hypotonic saline (0.02% NaCl) for 20 s, followed by
0.16% NaCl and a final wash with HBSS. After final washes, PMN
were resuspended to S x 106 cells/ml.
Preparation of erythrocytes. Erythrocytes were coupled to IV.3 Fab
(anti-FcyRll mAb) or human IgG2 myeloma protein by a biotin-avidin
technique, as described previously (21, 27). To prepare biotinylated E
(EB), 0.5 ml of E (1 X 109 cells/ml) were incubated with sulfo-NHS￾biotin (500 Mg/ml) for 20 min at 4°C, followed by three washes. EB at
1 x 109/ml were incubated with an equal volume of streptavidin (250
Mg/ml) for 30 min at 40C. The streptavidin coated EB (EBA) were then
washed and resuspended to 1 x 109 E/ml for immediate use. IV.3 Fab
and human IgG2 were biotinylated with NHS-LC-biotin (0.01 mg bio￾tin/mg protein) for 60 min at room temperature. To bind the biotinylated
mAb to the EBA, EBA (12.5 kl at 1 x 109/ml) were combined with 5
Al of biotinylated protein (0.01-5 Mg) for 45 min (27). After three
washes, the anti-FcyRII coated EBA (E-IV.3) and the hIgG2 coated EBA
(E-hIgG2) were then resuspended in 125 Ml (1 x 108 E/ml) and used
immediately. The density of opsonization of E-IV.3 and E-hIgG2 was
standardized with flow cytometry for all experiments as described pre￾viously (21, 27). To assure maximal levels of internalization by neutro￾phils, densely opsonized E-IV.3 and E-hIgG2 (as determined by immu￾nofluorescent flow cytometry) were used in the assays of phagocytosis.
Assay of phagocytosis. Quantitation of phagocytosis by PMN was
performed as described previously (5, 21). Briefly, cells were resus￾pended in RPMI at 5 x 106 cells/ml. For FcyRlIb-induced activation,
the PMN were preincubated for 5 min with 3G8 F(ab')2 (10 Mg/ml),
which remained present throughout the assay of phagocytosis. Saturating
concentrations of all anti-CD16, -CD35, or -CD18 F(ab')2 fragments
(as determined by flow cytometry) were used to cross-link PMN surface
receptors in all experiments and were present throughout the assay. In
the experiments with PDBu-treated PMN, PDBu (15 ng/ml) was added
simultaneously with the phagocytic particle. For inhibition experiments
the following reagents were added before the stimulus: SOD (150 gg/
ml), catalase (31,000 U/ml), azide (0.1%), PABA (10 mM), or TLCK
(0.5 mM). Duplicate samples without inhibitors were the controls for
each experimental condition.
To assess internalization of E target particles, PMN (100 ML) were
combined with E-IV.3 or E-hIgG2 (125 Ml). Because PMN from donors
homozygous for the HR allele of FcyRIIa have minimal binding and
internalization of E-hIgG2 (21), they were excluded from studies using
this probe. The leukocyte-erythrocyte mixtures (ratios of 1:25) were
centrifuged at 44 g for 3 min and then incubated at 37°C for 15 min to
allow for maximum internalization. After hypotonic lysis of noninternal￾ized E, phagocytosis was quantitated by light microscopy. At least 400
cells per slide were counted in duplicate. The data are expressed as
phagocytic index (PI, number of ingested erythrocytes per 100 PMN).
To study the capacity of supernatants from stimulated PMN to acti￾vate resting cells, PMN were treated with 3G8 F(ab')2 or PDBu for 5
min, washed twice, and cultured for 15 min at 370C in RPMI. Superna￾tants were collected and combined with fresh PMN and target particles.
After incubation for 15 min with or without catalase (31,000 U/ml)
phagocytosis was quantitated by light microscopy.
Assay of attachment. To quantitate adherence of E target particles
to PMN, cells were prepared and combined as described in the assay
of phagocytosis above. After centrifugation at 44 g for 3 min, the PMN￾erythrocyte mixtures were maintained at room temperature for 10 min
and then gently resuspended. Adherence of E to PMN was quantitated
by light microscopy. Data are expressed as attachment index (AI, num￾ber of adherent or internalized erythrocytes per 100 PMN). Under these
conditions, < 1% of phagocytes had internalized E.
To distinguish the effect of activation stimuli on FcyRfla-mediated
internalization from any effect on FcyRIIa-mediated adherence, incuba￾tion mixtures with PMN-erythrocyte ratios of 1:1 were used. In prelimi￾nary studies, it was determined that under these conditions all erythro￾cytes were bound to PMN, thus eliminating the potential to increase
phagocytosis by increasing adherence. Triplicate tubes were set up, with
the first tube used to determine AI and document the absence of free
(nonadherent) E by light microscopy. Under these conditions, with fixed
and limited adherence, the AI for E-IV.3 and E-hIgG2 were 106±25
attached E/ 100 PMN and 102±30, respectively. The remaining repli￾cates were incubated with or without activating agents [3G8F(ab')2
(10 Mg/ml)] and/or inhibitors [SOD (150 Mg/ml)] at 37°C for 15 min
and after lysis of noninternalized E, internalization was quantitated.
Immunofluorescent flow cytometry. Fresh leukocytes (5 X 105 in
PBS with 0.1% BSA) were incubated with saturating amounts of specific
mAb or isotype controls for 30 min at 4°C. After two washes with
cold PBS containing 0.1% BSA, cells were incubated with saturating
concentrations of PE-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG F(ab')2 for 30

min at 40C, followed by washing twice with cold PBS/0.1% BSA. E
coated with human IgG were stained with FITC-conjugated rabbit anti￾human IgG F(ab')2 and E coated with IV.3 Fab were stained with PE￾conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG F(ab')2, followed by washes with
cold PBS/0.1% BSA.
After staining, cell-associated immunofluorescence was quantitated
on a Cytofluorograf U1S (Becton Dickinson and Co., San Jose, CA) with
a 2151 computer as described previously (5). For each experiment, the
instrument was calibrated with quantitative FITC and PE microbead
standards (Flow Cytometry Standards Corp., Research Triangle Park,
NC) to allow for assessment of both absolute and relative levels of
immunofluorescence.
Data analysis. For assessment of the relative phagocytic capacity
of individuals with different FcyRHIb alleles, all experiments were
performed in a matched-pairs experimental design. Accordingly, each
subject homozygous for a given FcyRHIb allele was studied in compari￾son to a second subject, homozygous for the other allele and matched
for the same phenotype of FcyRIIa (e.g., NA1-LR vs. NA2-LR).
The effects of activating stimuli on FcyR-mediated phagocytosis
and attachment are presented as % control [100 x experimental PI (or
AI)/control PI(or AI)]. Data are displayed as mean±SEM. The effects
of stimuli or inhibitors were compared using a paired t test (two-tailed).
A probability of 0.05 was used to reject the null hypothesis that there
is no difference between the groups or conditions.
Results
Allele-sensitive differences in FcyRIIIb-induced activation of
FcyRIIa. PMN from donors homozygous for the NAl and NA2
alleles of FcyRFIIb in PMN differ in their capacities to mediate
internalization of IgG-sensitized erythrocytes. To determine the
relative roles of FcyRJIIb and FcyRIla in contributing to this
difference, we compared FcyRIIa-mediated internalization in
NA homozygous donors and the capacity of the two alleles of
FcyRIIMb to enhance FcyRlla function. PMN from normal do￾nors homozygous for NAl and NA2 alleles and matched for
identical FcyRfla alleles were studied simultaneously in a
matched-pairs design. In NA1 and NA2 homozygotes both base￾line expression of FcyRIIa and FcyRIIIb and specific FcyRIla￾mediated phagocytosis are equivalent (21). Cross-linking of
FcyRIIIb with 3G8 F(ab')2 in donors homozygous for the NA1
allele markedly increased internalization of erythrocytes cou￾pled to anti-FcyRH mAb IV.3 Fab (E-IV.3), an FcyRII-specific
probe (21, 27) (Fig. 1 A; P < 0.006). In contrast, in donors
homozygous for the NA2 allele, cross-linking of FcyRIllb did
not activate FcyRIIa-mediated internalization of E-IV.3 (NA1
vs. NA2, P < 0.005; n = 11). Cell surface expression of
FcyRIIa did not change after FcyRIIIb cross-linking in either
group (NA1 103±2% control; NA2 101±1% control; n = 4).
Furthermore, the capacity to activate FcyRHa function was not
intrinsically different in individuals homozygous for either NA1
or NA2; PDBu-induced enhancement of E-IV.3 internalization
(which is independent of FcyRIllb) was identical for both
groups (NA1 vs. NA2: 400±306% control vs. 434±212%, n
= 6 pairs). These findings indicate that the capacity of FcyRIHIb
to augment FcyRIa function varies with FcyRIllb structure
and is a specific property of FcyRIIIb.
The suggestion of an FcyRJIIb-induced increase in the at￾tachment index of E-IV.3 in NA1 individuals (Fig. 1 A) raised
the possibility that the FcyRIhIb cross-linking might alter ligand
binding capacity of FcyRlla in addition to amplification of
phagocytosis. Therefore, to examine FcyRIIIb-driven activation
of FcyRIIa in the context of an FcyRIIa-specific natural ligand
that might be more sensitive to changes in receptor avidity,

Figure 1. Cross-linking of FcyRIIb activates FcyRIla-mediated phago￾cytosis: allele-sensitivity. PMN from normal donors homozygous for
NAl and NA2 alleles and matched for identical FcyRlla alleles were
studied simultaneously in a matched-pairs design. PMN from each donor
were preincubated with 3G8 F(ab')2 (10 Mg/ml) or control medium
for 5 min and then combined with (A) E-IV.3 or (B) E-hIgG2. The
effects of 3G8 F(ab')2-induced activation on E-IV.3 phagocytosis and
attachment is presented as % control [100 x PI3G8 F(ab')2 (or AI)/PIcO I
(or AI)]. Control PI and Al for E-IV.3 were 114±16 E-IV.3 internal￾ized/100 PMN and 203±32 E-IV.3 attached/100 PMN, respectively,
and for E-hIgG2 105±12 E-hIgG2 internalized/100 PMN and 152±26
E-hIgG2 attached/ 100 PMN, respectively. Baseline AI and PI for NAI
and NA2 homozygotes were indistinguishable. (A) Cross-linking
FcyRIIb with 3G8 F(ab')2 in donors homozygous for the NAI allele
increased internalization of E-IV.3 (NA1 vs. control P < 0.006),
whereas in donors homozygous for the NA2 allele there was no increase
in FcyRlla-mediated internalization (NA1 vs. NA2 P < 0.005, n = 11
pairs). In NAl homozygotes, there was a trend toward increased adher￾ence of E-IV.3 in activated cells (NA1 vs. control 0.1 > P > 0.05;
NAl vs. NA2 P = NS; n = 6 pairs), but no increase in surface expres￾sion of FcyRHI (n = 4). (B) In donors homozygous for the NA1 allele,
cross-linking FcyRIIIb with 3G8F(ab ' )2 amplified internalization of E￾hIgG2 more than in NA2 donors (NA1 vs. NA2 P < 0.02; NA1 vs.
control P < 0.001; NA2 vs. control P < 0.05, n = 12 pairs). Cross￾linking of both the NA1 and NA2 alleles of FcyRIllb resulted in compa￾rable increments in attachment of E-hIgG2 (n = 5).
we explored the attachment and phagocytosis of erythrocytes
coupled to human IgG2 (E-hIgG2). We and others have pre￾viously shown that E-hIgG2 do not bind FcyRIllb but do bind
efficiently to the LR (131-H) allelic form of FcyRIIa (21,
28). In PMN from homozygous NA1 individuals 3G8 F(ab')2
preincubation significantly increased phagocytosis of E-hIgG2
(P < 0.001; Fig. 1 B). In contrast to the experiments with E￾IV.3, however, NA2 donors also were capable of increasing
FcyRIa-mediated phagocytosis of E-hIgG2 (P < 0.05). When
matched for FcyRlla alleles, stimulated PMN from NA1 donors
showed significantly greater increases in FcyRIIa function than
PMN from NA2 (P < 0.02). The increase in E-hIgG2 internal￾ization was greater than that in E-IV.3 for each group, which
may reflect the clear increase in the attachment index for E￾hIgG2 in both NA1 and NA2 donors (Fig. 1 B). Assessment
of the percentage of cells supporting attachment demonstrated
that the increase in attachment index reflects both a change in
the percent attachment and the number of E-hIgG2 attached per
cell.
To distinguish the effect of FcyRIIIb-mediated activation
on attachment to FcyRIIa per se from its effect on internaliza￾tion and to establish that both processes were indeed affected,
internalization was assessed at limiting PMN-erythrocyte ra￾tios. With a ratio of 1:1, all erythrocytes are bound to PMN,

Figure 2. Cross-linking CD16, but not CD35 or CD18, activates

F(ab')2), anti-CD35 (E 1 F(ab')2), or control medium and incubated
with either E-IV.3 or E-hIgG2. Phagocytosis was determined by light
microscopy. Data are expressed as % control (100 X PI, w/PL,",,,,,1).
Internalization of both FcyRIIa-specific probes is enhanced by two dis￾tinct methods of cross-linking FcyRIllb. Leul lb: E-hIgG2 P < 0.02,

which eliminates the potential to increase phagocytosis by in￾creasing adherence. Using this system of controlled adherence
(E-IV.3 AI: 106±25 attached E/100 PMN and E-hIgG2 AI:
102±30), treatment with 3G8 F(ab ' )2 still resulted in a consis￾tent increase in FcyRHa-mediated phagocytosis (E-IV.3,
191±22% control PI, n = 5, P < 0.003; E-hIgG2, 167±15%
control PI, n = 6, P < 0.007). Thus, cross-linking of FcyRIIIb
resulted in both increased attachment and enhanced efficiency
of internalization of E's attached to FcyRfla (Fig. 1).
To exclude the possibility that activation of FcyRIIa might
reflect a unique property of mAb 3G8, several different anti￾CD16 mAbs of differing isotypes were studied. PMN from NAl
homozygotes or NAl-NA2 heterozygotes were treated with
saturating concentrations of mAb 286.5 F(ab')2 (a mIgGi rec￾ognizing a ligand-binding site epitope) (24), Leullb (a
mIgM), or control medium. Internalization of both E-IV.3 and
E-hIgG2 was significantly augmented by both of these anti￾CD16 mAbs (Fig. 2). The lack of a requirement for an intact
IgG heavy chain in the cross-linking antibody is underscored
by experiments with the IgM anti-CD16 mAb Leul lb. Further￾more, the activation of FcyRIIa by intact Leul lb argues against
the possibility that contaminating residual proteases from the
digestion of IgG are the activators of FcyRIIa. In contrast to
results with 3G8 F(ab')2, 286.5 F(ab')2, and Leullb, incuba￾tion of PMN with F(ab')2 fragments of anti-CD35 (Eli) or
anti-CD18 (IB4) mAbs did not alter Fc'yRlla function (Fig.
2). These results emphasize the importance of CD16 cross￾linking as a specific trigger for the activation of Fc'yRII.
Activation ofFcyRIa-mediatedphagocytosis is oxidant de￾pendent. Gresham et al. (29) have demonstrated that phorbol
esters can stimulate neutrophil internalization of IgG-sensitized
E by both FcyRlla and FcyRllIb through an oxidant-dependent
mechanism. Given the ability of PDBu to augment Fc'yRIIa￾specific function, we evaluated the possibility that activation of
FcyRlla by PDBu and FcyRHIb might use a similar mecha￾nism. Internalization by FcyRHa was unaffected by incubation
with 0.5 mM H202, but in the presence of aminotriazole (20
mM), an inhibitor of catalase that can be released from endoge￾nous neutrophil stores and metabolize H202, internalization was
significantly increased by 0.5 mM H202 (E-IV.3 = 147±19%
control PI, n = 11, P < 0.03; E-hIgG2 = 133±10, n = 10; P
< 0.01). Given these observations providing direct evidence
that oxidants can affect receptor-specific function, we examined
the effects of SOD and catalase, inhibitors of reactive oxygen
metabolites. Neither SOD nor catalase altered baseline receptor￾specific phagocytosis (Fig. 3). PDBu significantly augmented
FcyRIIa-specific phagocytosis, an effect blocked by SOD and
catalase (Fig. 3) in a manner similar to their effects on EA
phagocytosis (29). In the presence of aminotriazole, PDBu re￾sulted in an even greater enhancement of FcyRIIa-mediated
internalization compared with PDBu alone (50% increase).
FcyRIllb-mediated phagocytosis was negligible at baseline and
unaffected by phorbols (30). Most importantly, the increase in
FcyRIIa phagocytosis induced by cross-linking FcyRIllb was
also inhibited in the presence of either SOD or catalase (Fig.
3). In contrast, heat-denatured and inactivated SOD did not
block either PDBu- or FcyRIb-induced stimulation (PDBu
with denatured SOD = 372±69% control PI E-hIgG2; 3G8
F(ab')2 with denatured SOD = 214±38% control PI). These
findings suggest that activation of FcyRlla is mediated by gen￾eration of reactive oxygen intermediates and provide strong
evidence that FcyRIIb triggers their generation.
Reactive oxygen intermediates are found in cell superna￾tants, and therefore we considered the possibility that the eryth￾rocyte probe might be modified by exposure to active superna￾tants and lead to the spurious conclusion that intrinsic FcyRIIa
properties are being altered. Supernatants from PDBu-treated
PMN were active in enhancing FcyRIIa-mediated binding and
phagocytosis of unstimulated PMN (Fig. 4). As predicted, the
activation induced by supernatants was oxidant dependent and
blocked by catalase (Fig. 4). Similar results from experiments
with supernatants from 3G8 F(ab')2-stimulated PMN
( 144±11% control, P < 0.04) indicated that this effect was not
simply a carry over of the stimulus per se from stimulated to
unstimulated cells, but due to soluble factors in supernatants
from activated cells. Having established the activity of stimu￾lated supernatants, we tested their capacity to directly modify
phagocytic probes. Treatment of both E-IV.3 and E-hIgG2 with
supernatants from stimulated PMN did not alter their internal￾ization (107±8% control and 97±2% control, respectively),
indicating not only that the oxidants are acting on the phago￾cytes rather than on the E's but also that oxidants may act in a
paracrine fashion.
Because 3G8 F(ab')2 pretreatment can induce an increase
in both ligand binding and phagocytic efficiency, we examined
the question of whether oxidants contributed to both effects.
Inclusion of SOD in incubation mixtures of stimulated PMN
abrogated the increase in attachment of E-hIgG2 (Fig. 5 A).
Similarly, with limiting PMN/erythrocyte ratios, SOD blocked
the augmentation of FcyRIIa-mediated phagocytosis of E-IV.3
or E-hIgG2 by FcyRIIIb cross-linking (Fig. 5 B). Thus both
components of FcyRllIb-stimulated phagocytosis by FcyRIIa
are oxidant dependent.
"Auto-opsonization" does not mediate FcyRIIIb-induced
augmentation of phagocytosis. We considered the possibility

that stimulated PMN might release the complement component
C3, which becomes activated and bound to the erythrocyte
probe ("auto-opsonization") (31, 32). Pretreatment of the
probe with active supernatants did not confer enhanced phago￾cytosis. Nonetheless, we blocked the ligand-binding site for
C3bi on complement receptor 3 with mAb MN41 IgG (26),
but this did not prevent enhancement of FcyRHa function (E￾hIgG2 internalization by PDBu-stimulated PMN: 443% unstim￾ulated PI, n = 4, P < 0.03). Recognizing that CDllb/CD18

shown in Fig. 6, internalization of E-IV.3 and E-hIgG2 was
enhanced to a similar extent with or without IB4 F(ab')2 (25
,ug/ml). Taken together these experiments do not support a role
for CD1 lb/CD18 in the activation of FcyRIIa. However, a role
for leukocyte response integrin or integrin-associated protein,
which have the potential to amplify FcyR function in other
systems (35-37), cannot be excluded.
Chlorinated oxidants and serine proteases participate in
FcyRIIa activation. Proteolysis by serine proteases has been
proposed as a mechanism for enhanced ligand binding by
FcyRIIa in human monocytes (38, 39). Because PMN can
use the H202-myeloperoxidase-chloride system to generate
chlorinated oxidants capable of activating such protease zymo￾gens and inactivating protease inhibitors (40-43), we consid￾ered the possibility that the generation of hypochlorous acid
might be the mechanism underlying oxidant-dependent en￾hancement of FcyRIIa-mediated ligand binding. H202 is a sub￾strate for the generation of HOC1, and °2- plays a role in regulat￾ing myeloperoxidase activity and may increase H202 availability
by oxidizing other substrates (44, 45). While inhibition of acti￾vation by both catalase and superoxide dismutase is consistent
with a role for HOCl, the more potent inhibition of FcyRIIa
activation by catalase supports this model.
To examine the contribution of HOC1 to oxidant-dependent
FcyRIb-driven activation of FcyRIIa, we assessed the ability
of methionine, a scavenger that rapidly reacts with HOC1 to
yield methionine sulfide (46), and sodium azide, an inhibitor
of myeloperoxidase, to abrogate activation. Constitutive inter￾nalization of E-hIgG2 was not significantly altered by coincuba￾tion with 20 mM methionine (131± 13% control), whereas 3G8
F(ab')2-induced amplification of E-hIgG2 phagocytosis was
significantly decreased (P < 0.008; Fig. 7). Methionine also
inhibited the 3G8 F(ab ' )2-induced increase of E-IV.3 phagocy￾tosis (P < 0.04; Fig. 7) and decreased PDBu-induced enhance￾ment (no methionine vs. methionine: 271±55 vs. 141±13% of
unstimulated PI, n = 6, P < 0.04). Coincubation with sodium
azide (0.1%) significantly decreased the FcyRIIb-induced en￾hancement of FcyRIla phagocytic function (E-hIgG2 P < 0.01;
E-IV.3 P < 0.001, Fig. 7). The PDBu-induced activation also

to induce FcyRlla activation or may facilitate the capacity of
proteases to alter the receptor-ligand interactions.
A role for proteases in FcyRIIa function has been suggested
by the observations that the serine protease inhibitor, TLCK,
decreases FcyRIIa-mediated binding of EA in human mono￾cytes (38, 39). As expected for the E-IV.3 probe, neither basal
levels (86±14% control PI, n = 6) nor 3G8 F(ab')2-stimulated
levels of internalization (no TLCK vs. TLCK: 156±10 vs.
138±12% of unstimulated PI) were significantly affected by
TLCK. In contrast, basal internalization of E-hIgG2, a probe
sensitive to changes in ligand-binding site, was moderately de￾creased in the presence of 0.5 mM TLCK (76±7% control, n
= 5, P < 0.03), while 3G8 F(ab')2-stimulated enhancement
was dramatically reduced from 217±22% of unstimulated PI
to 126_11% (n = 8, P < 0.02). As further evidence for the
role of inhibition of serine proteases, we preformed a series of
experiments in the presence of PABA, a specific reversible
serine protease inhibitor. Similar to TLCK, PABA significantly
reduced 3G8 F(ab')2 activation of internalization of E-hIgG2

that activation-induced proteolytic effects contribute to augmen￾tation of FcyRHa function primarily through changes in binding
detected by native ligand. Facilitation of this process by chlori￾nated oxidants provides a rapid mechanism by which neutro￾phils can use the FcyRIIIb-activated NADPH oxidase system
and granular constituents (47, 48) in a cooperative manner
to modulate the binding capacity of FcyRI1a without altering

Discussion
Neutrophils from normal donors, homozygous for the two dif￾ferent allelic phenotypes of FcyRllIb, have significantly differ￾ent levels of Fcy receptor-mediated phagocytosis (1). How￾ever, experiments using antireceptor mAb-targeted erythrocytes
indicate that FcyRllIb mediates phagocytosis poorly (2, 30)
and raise the possibility that FcyRIIHb may collaborate with
FcyRfla on neutrophils for internalization of EA. Such an inter￾active mechanism would require that FcyRIllb have the capac￾ity to influence FcyRHa-mediated phagocytosis and that this
capacity demonstrates quantitative differences between donors
homozygous for the two different FcyRIIIb alleles. Indeed, ini￾tial observations have suggested that cross-linking of FcyRIIIb
with antireceptor mAb can augment the phagocytic activity of
FcyRIIa on PMN (17). Therefore, we systematically explored
both the capacity of FcyRHIb to influence FcyRIIa in an allele￾sensitive fashion and the mechanisms underlying this effect.
Our data indicate that cross-linking of FcyRIIIb does acti￾vate FcyRIa for phagocytosis. Anti-CD16 mAbs of differing
isotypes enhanced FcyRlla function, demonstrating that prim￾ing is not a unique property of single mAb and is not dependent
on IgG heavy chain. Furthermore, F(ab')2 fragments of anti￾CD35 or -CD18 mAbs did not alter FcyRlla function, under￾scoring the importance of CD16 cross-linking as a specific trig￾ger for the activation of FcyRIH. The increase in FcyRlla-spe￾cific internalization reflects both an increase in ligand-mediated
binding of erythrocytes and an increase in internalization
efficiency of targets bound. This activation does not involve
FcyRIIIb serving as a ligand-binding, "capture" receptor deliv￾ering ligand directly to FcyRlla (49-51), because FcyRIIIb
does not bind hIgG2 although we recognize the possibility that
this might occur with some human IgGI and IgG3. The mecha￾nism of activation is dependent on the FcyRIllb-driven genera￾tion of oxidants, and at least part of the increase in avidity of
FcyRHa appears to rely on a proteolytic modification. In addi￾tion, an oxidant-dependent increase in FcyRlla-mediated inter￾nalization also occurs. The capacity of supernatants from stimu￾lated PMN to enhance FcyRIIa function in unstimulated PMN
precludes the need for a physical association between FcyRfla
and FcyRIllb. These oxidant-dependent mechanisms provide
the opportunity not only for autocrine stimulation of Fcy recep￾tor function but also for paracrine stimulation of different cells
and perhaps even different receptor species.
The mechanism of altered avidity involves, at least in part,
proteolysis. Previous work by Van de Winkel et al. (38, 39)
suggested that a proteolytic process was involved in FcyRIla￾mediated binding in monocytes. Although those studies did not
formally exclude the possibility that a change in surface charge
or other properties rather than direct receptor modification was
involved, our studies indicating a change in avidity for ligand￾driven binding of E-hIgG2 but not for mAb-driven binding of
E-IV.3 support the concept of direct modification of FcyRlla.
Of course, modification of an as yet unrecognized accessory
molecule participating in binding cannot be excluded. The abil￾ity of catalase and SOD to block this effect strongly implicates
oxidants in this process, and the inhibition of FcyRlla activation
in the presence of methionine, a scavenger for HOCl, or azide,
an inhibitor of myeloperoxidase, suggests that neutrophils can
use the H202-myeloperoxidase system to generate chlorinated
oxidants, such as HOCl, which activate proteinase zymogens
and inactivate proteinase inhibitors to begin a protease cascade.
Because quantitative receptor expression did not change, the
modulation of FcyRIa is unlike that for other leukocyte recep￾tors and counterreceptors, such as CD16, CD43, L-selectin,
and TNF receptor, which regulate surface expression through
enzymatic cleavage (15, 16, 52). Rather, conformational
changes affecting the ligand binding site appear most likely.
In addition to a change in avidity, our data clearly demon￾strate an increase in receptor-mediated internalization effi￾ciency. Although the incomplete blockade of activation of
TLCK or PABA could reflect either incomplete enzyme inhibi￾tion or the presence of several different mechanisms of activa￾tion, both the increase in E-IV.3 internalization in the absence
of an increase in binding and the increase in phagocytosis in
the limiting attachment paradigm unambiguously demonstrate
an enhancement of the efficiency of receptor-mediated internal￾ization. As with the change in avidity, this process involves the
FcyRIb-mediated generation of oxidants and is inhibitable by
both catalase and SOD. Given the rapid time frame for these
effects, it is unlikely that modulation of transcription factors
plays a significant role although oxidants are known to affect
NF-KB and others (53-55). In contrast, oxidants can rapidly
influence levels of quantitative tyrosine phosphorylation, and
tyrosine phosphorylation is essential for Fcy receptor-initiated
functions (56-58). Indeed, synergy between FcyRII and
FcyRIIb for activation of the respiratory burst and phagocyto￾sis requires tyrosine phosphorylation of FcyRII (30, 59). Of
course, changes in phosphorylation states could provide mecha￾nisms for both avidity modulation ( "inside-out" signaling [12-
14] ) and for internalization.
Our observations provide the basis for better understanding
of the mechanisms whereby FcyRLIb homozygous donors can
differ in quantitative EA phagocytosis. More importantly, how￾ever, our data indicate a mechanism for receptor collaboration
in an autocrine fashion without the requirement of either ligand￾mediated or -independent direct physical interaction between
receptor species. Of course, our results do not preclude a physi￾cal interaction of some fraction of FcyRIlb and FcyRlla, as
suggested by resonance energy transfer studies (60, 61), nor
do they preclude other molecules such as CR3 from playing a
role in FcyRIIa priming (59); however, they do suggest a more
general mechanism for FcyRHIb that has the potential to influ￾ence or "collaborate" with a broader range of receptors (30)
in both an autocrine and a paracrine fashion. Indeed, the target
cells for a paracrine effect need not be restricted to other phago￾cytes, and thus these paracrine effects may provide a foundation
for Fcy receptor alleles on phagocytes to influence other compo￾nents of the immune system.
In this context, these observations suggest that FcyR poly￾morphisms may be considered inherited disease susceptibility
factors in host defense against infection and in the development
of autoimmunity. For example, the current work showing that
NA2 homozygotes are relatively ineffective in amplifying
FcyRfla is consistent with the observation that individuals ho￾mozygous for FcyRlIb-NA2, especially when combined with
homozygosity for FcyRIIa-HR and with a terminal complement
component deficiency, are more likely to develop serious me￾ningococcal infection (62). Interactions with other components
of the immune system through modulation of protein tyrosine
kinase activities, transcription factors, and other mechanisms
remain to be explored.
