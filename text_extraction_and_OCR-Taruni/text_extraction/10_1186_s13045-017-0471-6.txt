Abstract
Wnt/β-catenin signaling, a highly conserved pathway through evolution, regulates key cellular functions including
proliferation, differentiation, migration, genetic stability, apoptosis, and stem cell renewal. The Wnt pathway
mediates biological processes by a canonical or noncanonical pathway, depending on the involvement of β￾catenin in signal transduction. β-catenin is a core component of the cadherin protein complex, whose stabilization
is essential for the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. As multiple aberrations in this pathway occur in numerous
cancers, WNT-directed therapy represents an area of significant developmental therapeutics focus. The recently
described role of Wnt/β-catenin pathway in regulating immune cell infiltration of the tumor microenvironment
renewed the interest, given its potential impact on responses to immunotherapy treatments. This article summarizes
the role of Wnt/β-catenin pathway in cancer and ongoing therapeutic strategies involving this pathway.

Background
Nusse and Varmus discovered the components of the
Wnt/β-catenin pathway in 1982 while studying onco￾genic mechanisms of mouse mammary tumor virus
(MMTV) [1]. Proviral insertion at the “integration site”
was thought to be the mechanism of carcinogenesis, giv￾ing the name to the first gene discovered in this pathway
as INT1. Simultaneous work in developmental biology
and work in drosophila established INT1 gene to be the
homologue of the Drosophila segment polarity gene,
Wingless [2]. Subsequently, human INT1 was shown to
be very similar to mouse INT1, thereby revealing the
highly conserved nature of this pathway across various
species [3]. Additional screens for MMTV proviral inser￾tion sites in tumors yielded several other activated genes
that are related to other developmental gene pathways,
such as INT2, INT3, and INT4 [4–6]. For example, INT2
is a member of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF; INT2
is the same FGF-3 protein) family, and INT3 is related
to the NOTCH gene family (INT3 protein is the same
neurogenic locus notch homologue 4/NOTCH4) [7, 8].
With “INT” nomenclature turning out to be inadequate
and confusing, consensus was reached to create the
hybrid name “WNT” (for Wingless-related integration
site) to denote genes belonging to the INT1/Wingless
family. INT1—now called WNT1—became the founding
member [9].
WNTs (translated products of WNT gene) are
cysteine-rich glycoproteins, secreted by cells into the
extracellular matrix, that activate receptor-mediated
signaling with cells in immediate proximity [10]. The
WNT protein family consists of at least 19 secreted
glycoproteins (350–400 amino acids in length) highly
conserved across species from invertebrates to mam￾mals [11]. WNT binds to the N-terminal extra￾cellular cysteine-rich domain of a Frizzled family re￾ceptor, a member of the superfamily of G-protein￾coupled receptors. This disrupts the destruction com￾plex of β-catenin (a tertiary complex formed by axin,
adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), CK1α, and
GSK3β) and triggers the cytoplasmic accumulation of
β-catenin (Fig. 1).
T cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor-1 (TCF/Lef1) is
the transcription complex that mediates canonical

WNT-triggered gene transcription [12, 13]. β-catenin
translocates into the nucleus where it interacts with
TCF/Lef1 and activates TCF/Lef1 transcription com￾plex [14–16]. β-catenin also localizes to multiple sub￾cellular locations including the cytoplasm where its
levels are tightly controlled. β-catenin also promotes
cell-to-cell adhesion by accumulating in cell–cell con￾tact sites, namely the adherens junctions [17, 18].
Figure 1 illustrates the canonical pathway of Wnt/β￾catenin signaling. In addition to classical canonical
WNT-induced activation of β-catenin–TCF/Lef1 tran￾scriptional complexes, WNT can elicit alternative re￾sponses through β-catenin independent mechanisms
which are collectively known as noncanonical path￾ways [19]. In an alternative concept known as inte￾grated Wnt pathway, the canonical and noncanonical
pathways are combined and multiple inputs at the
level of both Wnt-receptor binding and the down￾stream, intracellular response have been integrated
[20].
Wnt/β-catenin pathway is intricately involved in
pathogenesis of several cancers. Recent findings of its
role in regulating immunomodulation have renewed en￾thusiasm in the field.
Wnt/β-catenin pathway involvement in several
malignancies
Colorectal cancers (CRCs)
The role of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in carcinogen￾esis was first described in the setting of APC gene muta￾tion. APC mutations, which typically are acquired early
in the pathogenesis of most colon cancers (over 80%),
lead to cytosolic accumulation of β-catenin that in com￾bination with TCF/Lef1 shuttles to the nucleus where it
functions as a transcription factor and promotes cellular
proliferation [21, 22]. Nuclear expression of β-catenin
has been associated with more aggressive cancer biology.
In one study, nuclear expression of β-catenin was
present in 18 out of 25 (72%) cases of ulcerative CRC
while present in only 7 out of 26 (26.9%) cases of polyp￾oid CRC (P < 0.001). This finding was independent of
APC mutation and E-cadherin expression [23]. The
Wnt/β-catenin pathway is also involved in cross talk
with the Hippo/YAP pathway. Konsavage et al. showed
that β-catenin/TCF4 complexes bind a DNA enhancer
element within the first intron of the YAP gene to drive
YAP expression in CRC cells, contributing to carcinogen￾esis [24]. The Hippo–YAP signaling pathway could be an
effector pathway downstream from APC, independent
Fig. 1 Canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway: “WNT ON state”: WNT proteins, by binding to frizzled receptors and the LRP co-receptor, act to suppress
the activity of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β). ZNRF3 promotes degradation of WNT receptor functioning as tumor suppressors. This
prevents phosphorylation of downstream molecules allowing β-catenin association with Tcf/Lef in the nucleus and subsequent increased cell
proliferation. “WNT OFF state”: In the absence of WNT ligand, the destruction complex of β-catenin (marked by dotted line box), a tertiary
complex formed by axin, APC, CK1α and GSK 3β, will phosphorylate β-catenin, which subsequently undergoes proteasomal degradation
Pai et al. Journal of Hematology & Oncology (2017) 10:101 Page 2 of 12

from its involvement in the β-catenin destruction complex
as well [25].
The WNT pathway has been implicated in the main￾tenance of cancer stem cells (CSC) in colorectal cancer.
In vitro data suggest that chronic chemotherapeutic
stress-induced “stemness” is associated with attenuated
WNT signaling [26]. Vermeulen et al. showed that high
activity of the WNT pathway was observed preferentially
in tumor cells located close to stromal myofibroblasts,
which are thought to secrete factors such as hepatocyte
growth factor (HGF) that activate β-catenin-dependent
transcription. This maintains CSC clonogenicity and re￾stores the CSC phenotype in more differentiated tumor
cells both in vitro and in vivo [27]. HGF additionally
induces β-catenin nuclear translocation through Met/β￾catenin dissociation, in a Wnt-independent pathway [28].
Noncolorectal gastrointestinal cancers
β-catenin mutations have been implicated in early steps of
carcinogenesis by activating the WNT pathway in gastric
and non-hepatitis-related hepatocellular cancers [29, 30].
Cholangiocarcinoma has also been shown to be a WNT￾dependent cancer, which thrives on canonical WNT path￾way upregulation. Activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling,
by the pluripotent mesenchymal stem cells recruited to
the tumor site, seems to play a central role in tumor
microenvironment modulation by promoting metastatic
growth and resistance to chemotherapy in cholangiocarci￾noma [31]. M2-polarized tumor-associated macrophages
(TAMs) in the surrounding stroma are known to maintain
a highly activated WNT pathway in the tumor [32].
Desmoid tumors
Crago et al. demonstrated that mutations affecting APC
and CTNNB1 (gene encoding β-catenin) occur frequently
in desmoid tumors (111 of 117; 95%). Even true CTNNB1
wild-type tumors (determined by next-generation sequen￾cing) may have genomic alterations associated with WNT
activation such as chromosome 6-loss/BMI1 mutation,
supporting Wnt/β-catenin activation as an important
pathway governing desmoid initiation [33].
Breast cancer
WNT/β-catenin signaling regulates the self-renewal and
migration of CSCs, thereby promoting tumor growth
and metastasis in breast cancer [34]. TAMs in the inva￾sive front of primary mammary tumors have higher ex￾pression of molecules involved in WNT-signaling
suggesting a role in tumor cell migration, invasiveness,
and metastasis [35]. In triple negative breast cancers, β￾catenin expression was associated with poor overall sur￾vival and disease-specific survival [36]. Upregulation of
Wnt/β-catenin has been shown to be a mechanism of
resistance to PI3K inhibitors, and the use of β-catenin
inhibitors may sensitize PIK3CA mutant breast cancer
to PI3K inhibition [37].
Adrenocortical tumors
Wnt/β-catenin activation has been shown to be an inde￾pendent prognostic factor of overall and disease-free sur￾vival in patients with resected primary adrenocortical
cancer. The presence of β-catenin nuclear staining was
significantly associated with higher tumor stage and risk
score, frequent necrosis, mitoses, and other associated
mutations [38]. Results from animal models have sug￾gested that β-catenin can function as an adrenal onco￾gene causing progressive sub-capsular cell hyperplasia,
ectopic expansion of spongiocytes and sub-capsular cell
with resulting dysplasia, and marked differentiation
defects resulting in primary hyperaldosteronism and de￾velopment of malignant characteristics such as uncon￾trolled neovascularization and local invasion when there
is prolonged activation [39].
Melanoma
Wnt/β-catenin activation may have conflicting roles in
the metastatic spread of melanoma [40]. β-catenin sig￾naling decreased the migration of melanocytes and mel￾anoma cell lines in vitro but promoted lung metastases
in the NRAS-driven melanoma murine model. β-catenin
seems to be a major driver of melanoma dissemination
to lymph nodes and lungs in a mouse model based on
melanocyte-specific PTEN loss and BRAF (V600E) mu￾tation [41]. β-catenin level also controls tumor differen￾tiation and regulates both MAPK/Erk and PI3K/Akt
signaling. In fact, activation of Wnt/β-catenin and AKT
pathways mediates chemo-resistance and increased inva￾sion in melanoma cell lines [42].
Glioblastoma multiforme
Components of WNT pathway are usually overexpressed
in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) tumors. PLAG2
overexpression may play a role in inducing upregulation
of WNT6, FZD9, and FZD2, ultimately leading to the
maintenance of stemness features of GBM stem cells
[43]. β-catenin also increases the expression DNA repair
enzyme O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase
(MGMT) through Tcf/Lef binding located in the
hmMGMT 5′-flanking regulatory region. Genetic or
pharmacological inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling
reduces MGMT expression and increases the cytotoxic
effects of temozolomide [44].
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC)
Higher levels of β-catenin are associated with poor prog￾nosis, higher stage, node involvement, vascular invasion,
and sarcomatoid differentiation in RCC [45]. Multilayer￾omics analysis including methylome and transcriptome
Pai et al. Journal of Hematology & Oncology (2017) 10:101 Page 3 of 12

analyses also demonstrated a significant role of Wnt/β￾catenin signaling pathway in RCC pathogenesis [46].
Mutations in GCN1L1, MED12, and CCNC, members of
the CDK8 mediator complex that directly regulate β￾catenin-driven transcription, were identified in 16% of
the RCCs [46].
Osteosarcoma
Wnt receptor LRP-5 expression correlates with a worse
event-free survival in patients with osteosarcoma [47].
Targeting LRP5 receptor signaling with a dominant￾negative form of the receptor inhibited tumor growth
and metastasis and reduced the expression of cancer cell
invasiveness-associated markers in animal models of
osteosarcoma.
Hematological malignancies
Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is required for self￾renewal of CSCs. Yeung et al. demonstrated that β￾catenin was activated during development of mixed￾lineage leukemia (MLL) CSCs. Suppression of β-catenin
reversed CSCs to a pre-CSC-like stage and reduced the
growth of human MLL leukemic cells [48]. CSCs rely on
Wnt/β-catenin pathway in addition to other important
pathways like PI3K/Akt/mTOR and JAK/STAT for ac￾quiring therapy resistance [49]. In chronic myelogenous
leukemia, deletion of β-catenin synergized with imatinib
resulted in a delay of disease recurrence after imatinib
discontinuation [50]. Wnt pathway has been shown to
be upregulated in mantle cell lymphoma-initiating cells
(MCL-IL) [51]. In addition, MCL-ILs were shown to be
sensitive when targeted downstream at β-catenin￾mediated transcription complex with inhibitors such as
CCT036477, iCRT14, and PKF118-310. β-catenin
mRNA or protein expression was shown to be upregu￾lated in the bone marrow aspirates of patients with
myelofibrosis and in other Philadelphia-negative mye￾loproliferative neoplasms [52, 53]. The Wnt/β-catenin
pathway is also involved in the pathogenesis of mul￾tiple myeloma (MM), with silencing of the pathway
resulting in autophagy and apoptosis in MM cells
[54]. Loss of the deubiquitinating enzyme CYLD has
been shown to enhance MM aggressiveness via Wnt
pathway activation [55].
WNT inhibitors in clinical development
Several therapeutic strategies have been developed with
the aim to inhibit WNT-pathway, and many agents are
undergoing early phase clinical trials (Table 1 and Fig. 2).
Membrane bound O-acyl transferase porcupine (PORCN)
has emerged as a molecular target of interest to treat
WNT-driven cancers [56]. Addition of palmitoyl groups
to WNT proteins is catalyzed by PORCN, a biochemical
process known as palmitoylation or S-acylation in the
endoplasmic reticulum, which enhances WNT secretion
into the cytoplasm [57]. WNT974, a PORCN inhibitor,
produced cytostatic effects in ovarian cancer cells in vitro
[58] and decreased tumor growth and metastatic spread
in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma models in vivo
[59]. A phase I/II trial evaluating WNT974 in combination
with LGX818, a specific BRAF inhibitor, and cetuximab in
patients with metastatic colorectal cancer bearing WNT
and BRAF mutations is ongoing (NCT02278133). Another
trial is evaluating WNT974 in patients with metastatic
head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (NCT02649530).
WNT agonists, specifically WNT-5a activation, have
shown to inhibit metastases. Increased WNT-5a sig￾naling suppressed endothelial tumor cell migration
and invasion and inhibited metastasis in model of
breast cancer in vivo. Foxy-5 is a WNT-5a mimic
hexapeptide that binds and activates the WNT-5a re￾ceptors, Frizzled-2 and Frizzled-5 [60]. Two phase I
trials are evaluating Foxy-5 in advanced solid tumors
(breast, colorectal, and prostate) with loss or reduced
expression of WNT-5a protein (NCT02020291 and
NCT02655952).
CWP232291 is a novel small molecule that binds Src
associated with mitosis 68K protein (Sam68). Preclinical
data showed selective inhibitory activity on a WNT gene
reporter and decreased expression of the β-catenin tar￾get genes, cyclin D1 and survivin. CWP232291 is being
tested in phase I clinical trials in patients with acute
myeloid leukemia (NCT01398462) and relapsed or re￾fractory myeloma (NCT02426723) [61].
Genistein, a dietary compound present in soy-based
foods, is thought to mediate anticancer activity through
pleiotropic mechanisms that may include the inhibition
of WNT pathway [62]. Phase I and II studies investigat￾ing the clinical activity of genistein and other soy
isoflavones compounds in cancer treatment and chemo￾prevention have been published with disappointing
results [63–65].
OMP-54F28 (Ipafricept) is a fusion protein that com￾bines the immunoglobulin Fc domain with the cysteine￾rich domain of frizzled family receptor 8 (Fzd8) compet￾ing with the native Fzd8 receptor for its ligands and an￾tagonizes WNT signaling [66]. A dose-escalation phase I
showed that OMP-54F28 was well tolerated and dose es￾calation cohorts with standard therapy in advanced he￾patocellular cancers (NCT02069145), pancreatic cancers
(NCT02050178), and recurrent platinum-sensitive ovar￾ian cancer (NCT02092363) are under way [67]. Another
monoclonal antibody against frizzled receptors OMP￾18R5 is in phase 1 clinical trials for patients with meta￾static breast cancer in combination with paclitaxel.
DKN-01 is a humanized monoclonal antibody (Mab)
with neutralizing activity against Dickkopf-1 (Dkk-1).

chemotherapy agents is the basis for clinical testing of
these agents in combination.
Preclinical studies have addressed several other strat￾egies to counteract Wnt/β-catenin-mediated carcinogen￾esis, although they have not been yet tested in clinical
trials. Inducing or stabilizing the “destruction complex”
of β-catenin, therefore reducing its intracellular levels
and precluding its transcriptional activity, is a promising
strategy. Axin is a concentration-limiting component of
the β-catenin destruction complex, and its stability is
regulated by tankyrase, the key regulator enzyme that is
responsible for poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PARsylation) of
axin and induces its proteasomal degradation [68, 69].
Waaler et al. demonstrated the antitumoral effect of
inhibiting tankyrase in a model of colorectal adenoma
and adenocarcinoma [70]. Potential adverse events of

Fig. 2 Therapeutic targets in Wnt/β-catenin pathway and developmental therapeutics. Multiple strategies have been under investigation to
counteract the canonical pathway of Wnt signaling. a, b Wnt soluble receptors and antibodies directed to Frizzled receptors impair the
interaction ligand/receptor and its conveyed signal. c COX inhibitors reduces β-catenin cytoplasmic levels through different ways. PGE2, the main
product of COX2 enzyme, is thought to mediate β-catenin transcription. Also, COX inhibitors such as aspirin were related to increase β-catenin
ubiquitination and proteasomal destruction. d Tankyrase activates axin through induction of PARsylation and proteasomal degradation; tankyrase
inhibitors increase the levels of axin, facilitating the formation of the β-catenin destruction complex and reducing β-catenin availability. e CBP
inhibitors reduce the interaction between CBP and Tcf/Lef, reducing Tcf/Lef activity. f. PORCN inhibitors reduce the essential palmitoylation of Wnt,

this therapy include diarrhea and intestinal toxicity [71].
Tankyrase inhibition has been shown to revert resistance
to PI3K and AKT inhibitors in colorectal cancer patient￾derived sphere cultures and mouse tumor xenografts
[72]. High nuclear β-catenin expression predicted
resistance to PI3K and AKT inhibitors. Combined treat￾ment with a WNT/tankyrase inhibitor reduced nuclear
β-catenin, reverted resistance to PI3K and AKT inhibi￾tors, and repressed tumor growth.
Another possible strategy to reduce signaling through
the canonical pathway of Wnt/β-catenin consists of an￾tagonizing β-catenin/TCF-mediated transcription. Be￾cause transcriptional regulation of the β-catenin/TCF
complex needs some coactivators, such as the cAMP re￾sponse element-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein
(CBP), this molecule was considered a potential target
for inhibition [73]. INT-001, a specific antagonist of
CBP, showed antitumoral activity in preclinical models
of pancreatic, colon, and tamoxifen-resistant breast
cancers [74–76].
Multiple observational studies and randomized con￾trolled trials have demonstrated a chemo-preventative
role for aspirin, particularly in the development of colo￾rectal neoplasia. Given the critical importance of WNT
dysregulation in colorectal carcinogenesis, the interplay
between aspirin and canonical WNT signaling has be￾come a focus of investigation [77]. Through inhibiting
cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), aspirin decreases the avail￾ability of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), therefore reducing
WNT levels [78]. Interestingly, cancer cells when ex￾posed to aspirin in vitro led to the inhibition of WNT
pathway through increasing β-catenin ubiquitination and
consequent degradation, independent on COX inhibition
as well [79]. Figure 2 summarizes the developmental
strategies under investigation in Wnt/β-catenin pathway.
Cancer immunity and Wnt/β-catenin pathway
Overexpression of immune checkpoint molecules in the
tumor microenvironment has a critical role in antitumor
immunity evasion and cancer progression [80]. Cur￾rently, four immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) are ap￾proved for treatment of cancer, including ipilimumab
(anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (anti￾CTLA4)), nivolumab, pembrolizumab (anti-programmed
death-1 (anti-PD-1)), and atezolizumab (anti-programmed
death ligand-1 (anti-PD-L1)). Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies
have demonstrated clinical activity in more than 15 cancer
types, but the majority of patients with advanced cancer
still do not derive clinical benefit from these drugs sug￾gesting that immunosuppressive mechanisms within the
tumor microenvironment may play a role in de novo re￾sistance to these therapies.
Clinical responses to multiple T cell-based therapies,
including immune checkpoint inhibitors, have correlated
with tumors with a T cell-inflamed microenvironment
[81, 82]. These tumors are characterized by infiltration
of CD8+ T cells, chemokines, and an interferon signa￾ture, which ultimately correlate with improved survival
and responses to immunotherapies [83, 84]. On the
other hand, it has been recognized that tumors without
T cell infiltration have worse prognosis and do not bene￾fit from immunotherapy [84]. Thus, understanding
mechanisms driving T cell exclusion is critical to in￾crease the number of patients that will benefit from
immunotherapy.
Wnt/β-catenin pathway has been identified as one of
the important oncogenic pathway signaling related to
immune evasion (Fig. 3) [85, 86]. In a teratoma model,
enhanced expression of Wnt correlated with impaired
immune cell recruitment. Both T- and B cell infiltration
was reduced which was independent of teratoma size
and differentiation suggesting impaired immune surveil￾lance [87]. Luke et al. evaluated gene expression data
from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to segregate
tumors based on a T cell-inflamed gene expression sig￾nature and classified 8890 tumor samples into T cell￾inflamed, non-T cell inflamed, and intermediate subtypes
[88]. Approximately one third of the interrogated tumors
were characterized as non-T cell inflamed. They further
interrogated exomic sequencing to address the presence
of mutations in Wnt/β-catenin pathway in this subtype.
Activating mutations in CTNNB1 and inactivating muta￾tions in negative regulators such as Axin1, Axin2, APC1,
and APC2 were related to non-T cell inflamed gene sig￾nature, accounting for about 13% of the sequenced tu￾mors. Most of the mutations were noted in Exon 3 of
the CTNNB1 gene, with mis-sense mutation being the
most common. Evidence of β-catenin pathway activa￾tion, in the presence of mutation or otherwise, was
noted in 24 of 30 solid tumors of TCGA. Evidence for
pathway activation without mutation was evidenced by
increased expression of β-catenin pathway elements
such as WNT ligands, Fzd receptors, or β-catenin itself.
Immunohistochemistry demonstrated inverse correla￾tions between β-catenin and CD8+ T cell infiltration.
These results suggest that increased expression of β￾catenin in the tumor should be investigated and vali￾dated as a predictive tool to improve the selection of
candidate patients for checkpoint inhibition therapy. In
addition, one might hypothesize that inhibition of Wnt/
β-catenin signaling could improve CD8+ T cell infiltra￾tion and priming, therefore possibly producing a more
favorable scenario to immune checkpoint inhibition [89].
Thus, the investigation of the possible role of Wnt/β￾catenin inhibitors as possible adjuvants to anti-PD1,
anti-CTLA4, or anti-PD-L1 is an interesting strategy
and should be evaluated in preclinical and clinical
studies.

While tumor infiltration with CD8+ effector T cell
is favorable, presence of regulatory T cells (Treg) has
been associated with poor antitumor immunity. Tregs
are known to suppress adaptive responses mainly by
reducing CD8+ T cell proliferation, activation, and ef￾fector function [90, 91]. Some studies have shown
that expression of β-catenin has been associated with
Treg infiltration, survival, and activity [92, 93]. In an
adoptive transfer mouse colorectal cancer model, β￾catenin expression was enforced in intratumoral CD4+
T cells using lentiviral transduction. This led to in￾creased IL-17a expression, enhanced proliferation, and
inhibited apoptosis of colorectal cancer cells [87]. Ac￾tive WNT signaling has been shown to disrupt Foxp3
transcriptional activity, a crucial step for both the de￾velopment and function of regulatory T cells [94].
Hence, it has to be recognized that blocking WNT
for immunomodulation is still controversial at this
time. On the other hand, induction of Wnt signaling
has shown to be important in maintenance of stem￾ness of memory CD8+ T cells by blocking T cell dif￾ferentiation [95]. This strategy may be used in
generating memory T cell populations, thereby im￾proving effectiveness of cancer vaccines, and may find
applications in programming antitumor T cells for
adoptive immunotherapy [96].
Wnt/β-catenin pathway has also been associated with
modulation of innate immunity, such as dendritic cells
[97]. Spranger et al. detected a correlation between acti￾vation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and ab￾sence of a T cell gene expression signature in human
metastatic melanoma [98]. Active β-catenin signaling
was observed in 48% of non-T cell-infiltrated melano￾mas, which was thought to be the important pathway
mediating immune exclusion. In mouse models, β￾catenin induced expression of the transcription repressor
ATF3, which suppressed the transcription of CCL4. The
defective production of CCL4 led to impaired infiltration
and activation of Batf3-lineage CD103+ dendritic cells,
reduced CD8+ T cell priming and infiltration, and conse￾quent non-response to immune check point blockade. In
the absence of active β-catenin signaling, the normal
production of CCL4 was restored, leading to CD103+
dendritic cell activation and infiltration and proficient
priming of CD8+ T cell. Wnt/β-catenin signaling in in￾testinal dendritic cells has shown to regulate the balance
between inflammatory versus regulatory responses in the
gut [99]. β-catenin when expressed in intestinal dendritic
Fig. 3 Mechanisms of immune exclusion through Wnt/beta-catenin pathway: Activation of Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in tumor leads to
noninflammatory milieu through multiple mechanisms. a By acting on Batf3-lineage CD103+ dendritic cells, decreasing CCL4 production by
inducing the gene expression of the transcription repressor ATF3. This in turn reduces CD8+ T cell priming and infiltration. b By interacting with
tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) through Snail (a soluble factor product of a Wnt-regulated gene) which can in turn increase beta-catenin
activity by IL-1β. c β-catenin can enhance Treg survival through unknown mechanisms

cells was associated with expression of anti-inflammatory
mediators such as retinoic acid-metabolizing enzymes,
interleukin-10, and transforming growth factor-β, and the
stimulation of Treg induction [100].
Wnt/Beta-catenin signaling has been shown to be in￾volved in cross talk between cancer cells and tumor￾associated macrophages. Kaler et al. demonstrated a pos￾sible role of interleukin-1β secreted by TAMs in the in￾creased availability of β-catenin through phosphorylation
of GSK3β in colon cancer cells, disrupting the function
of β-catenin destruction complex [101]. Colorectal can￾cer cells stimulate macrophage production of IL-1β
through Snail, a soluble factor product of a Wnt￾regulated gene. These data demonstrated a novel Wnt￾dependent cross talk mechanism between tumor cells
and macrophages [102].
Conclusions
The Wnt/β-catenin pathway is increasingly recognized
as a potentially important target for anticancer therapies,
with several relevant inhibitors at various stages of clin￾ical development. The expanding role of immunother￾apies in cancer and recent insight into the role of Wnt￾pathway in cancer-related immune-regulation may give a
new dimension to this field of developmental therapeu￾tics. Only tumors with upregulated Wnt/β-catenin sig￾naling such as colorectal cancer have been explored as
targets for Wnt inhibition. However, with its role in
immunomodulation, Wnt inhibitors may have a broader
role in cancers such as melanoma, lung, and renal can￾cers where immunotherapy has come to the forefront.
There are some nuances to be addressed in the exact
role of Wnt signaling in immunomodulation before this
could be adopted in clinical practice.
