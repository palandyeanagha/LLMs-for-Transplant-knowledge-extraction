Abstract
Background: We set a model of brain death, donor management, and lung
transplantation for studies on lung preservation and reconditioning before
transplantation.
Methods: Ten pigs (39.7 ± 5.9 Kg) were investigated. Five animals underwent brain
death and were treated as organ donors; the lungs were then procured and
cold stored (Ischemia). Five recipients underwent left lung transplantation and
post-reperfusion follow-up (Graft). Cardiorespiratory and metabolic parameters were
collected. Lung gene expression of cytokines (tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα),
interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interferon gamma (IFNγ), high mobility
group box-1 (HMGB-1)), chemokines (chemokine CC motif ligand-2 (CCL2-MCP-1),
chemokine CXC motif ligand-10 (CXCL-10), interleukin-8 (IL-8)), and endothelial
activation markers (endothelin-1 (EDN-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1),
vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), selectin-E (SELE)) was assessed by
real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
Results: Tachycardia and hypertension occurred during brain death induction;
cardiac output rose, systemic vascular resistance dropped (P < 0.05), and diabetes
insipidus occurred. Lung-protective ventilation strategy was applied: 9 h after brain
death induction, PaO2 was 192 ± 12 mmHg at positive end-expiratory pressure
(PEEP) 8.0 ± 1.8 cmH2O and FiO2 of 40%; wet-to-dry ratio (W/D) was 5.8 ± 0.5, and
extravascular lung water (EVLW) was 359 ± 80 mL. Procured lungs were cold-stored
for 471 ± 24 min (Ischemia) at the end of which W/D was 6.1 ± 0.9. Left lungs were
transplanted and reperfused (warm ischemia 98 ± 14 min). Six hours after controlled
reperfusion, PaO2 was 192 ± 23 mmHg (PEEP 8.7 ± 1.5 cmH2O, FiO2 40%), W/D was
5.6 ± 0.4, and EVLW was 366 ± 117 mL. Levels of IL-8 rose at the end of donor
management (BD, P < 0.05); CCL2-MCP-1, IL-8, HMGB-1, and SELE were significantly
altered after reperfusion (Graft, P < 0.05).
Conclusions: We have set a standardized, reproducible pig model resembling the
entire process of organ donation that may be used as a platform to test in vivo and
ex vivo strategies of donor lung optimization before transplantation.

Background
Over several decades, lung transplantation has become a consolidated treatment mo￾dality. However, the disproportion between organ supply and demand has not been
solved. Consequently, donor criteria have been progressively expanded to increase the
donor pool [1,2]. In addition, new techniques such as extracorporeal lung reconditioning
[3-5] that allow pharmacological [6,7], gene [8], or cell [9] therapy have been proposed. As a
consequence of these novel opportunities, the concept of organ ‘acceptability’ has been
reconsidered: organs that were previously considered unsuitable for transplantation are now
well accepted [4,10-14]. However, while this extended suitability aids solving the organ
shortage problem, it also raises several issues, among which the need to implement proto￾cols of treatment in order to preserve over the donation process, if not ameliorate, the func￾tion of organs that a few years ago would not have been considered for transplantation.
The aim of this investigation was to set and characterize a pig model that closely resem￾bles the entire process of lung donation and transplantation. Each phase of the clinical
procedure, including the pathophysiological changes induced by brain death, the com￾plexity of donor management, and lung transplantation has been carefully reproduced.
Further, we have applied a lung-protective ventilatory strategy in the donor animals and
during the reperfusion phase of transplantation and measured gene expression of import￾ant cytokines, chemokines and markers of endothelial activation throughout the protocol.
Hereafter, we present and discuss the results of our investigation.
Methods
This experimental study was performed after the Ethics Committee of the Fondazione
IRCCS Ca’ Granda - Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico and the Italian Ministry of Health
approved the protocol (Permit Number: 05/12). All surgeries were performed under
anesthesia, and all efforts were made to minimize suffering. Experiments were per￾formed in conformity to the revised Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources, Com￾mission on Life Sciences, National Research Council ‘Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals’ National Academy Press, Washington, D.C., 1996 (http://www.
nap.edu/catalog/5140.html).
A schematic overview of the protocol is shown in Figure 1. Each experiment was run
using two animals (lung donor and transplantation recipient). The donor underwent in￾duction of brain death followed by organ donor management for a total of 9 h after
brain death induction; the lungs were then harvested and cold-stored for 8 h. The re￾cipient pig underwent pneumonectomy and transplantation of the left donor lung;
post-reperfusion follow-up was carried on for the next 6 h.
Anesthesia and monitoring
Details of anesthesia and monitoring are described in Additional file 1. Briefly, animals
received an intramuscular injection of olanzapine and tiletamine 2 mg (Zoletil, VIRBAC
s.r.l., Milan, Italy) and medetomidine 1 mg (Domitor, Pfizer Animal Health, Exton, PA,
USA and Div. of Pfizer Inc., New York, NY, USA). A continuous intravenous infusion
of propofol (Diprivan, AstraZeneca, Basiglio, Milan, Italy) 10 to 15 mg/Kg/h and mede￾tomidine 3 to 6 μg/Kg/h was then started. A number of catheters were positioned and
secured in place to measure arterial, central venous, and pulmonary artery pressure

throughout brain death induction, donor treatment, recipient surgery, and follow-up.
Cardiac output was measured by the Swan-Ganz catheter. Extravascular lung water
(EVLW), global end diastolic volume (GEDV), and stroke volume variation (SVV) were
monitored by PiCCO2® (PULSION Medical Systems, AG, Stahlgruberring 28, München,
Deutschland, Germany) monitor. Analysis of pO2, pCO2, pH, and derived variables (base
excess, HCO3), together with electrolytes (Na+
, K+
, Ca2+, Cl−
), glucose, and lactate con￾centrations was performed on arterial and central venous samples (Radiometer ABL 800
Flex, Radiometer Medical ApS, Brønshøj, Denmark). Urinary electrolytes concentrations
were measured by K.I.N.G.® (Orvim s.r.l., Paderno Dugnano, Milan, Italy). Blood chemis￾try (blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase
(SGOT), serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (SGPT), troponin T) was also assessed at
baseline and at the end of donor management (BD).
Induction of brain death
To induce brain death, a slight modification of the protocol described by Purins et al.
was used [15]. Briefly, to rise intracranial pressure (ICP), an 18-Fr Foley catheter (Willy
Rush AG, Kernen, Germany) was placed in the epidural space and progressively inflated
with saline (1.5 mL every 10 min). ICP was continuously measured by connecting a
subdural probe (Integra Neurosciences, TraumaCath, Enterprise Drive, Plainsboro, NJ,
USA) to a pressure transducer (TruWave, Edwards Lifesciences LLC, Irvine, CA, USA).
The balloon of the Foley catheter was inflated until cerebral perfusion pressure, calcu￾lated as mean arterial pressure (MAP) minus ICP (CPP = MAP − ICP), was less than
0 mmHg. At each step of inflation, the microballoon of a 5-Fr pulmonary arterial cath￾eter (Edwards Lifesciences LLC) positioned intraparenchymally was inflated with 1 mL
of air; the maneuver was used to calculate intracranial compliance (IC = 1/ΔICP). Once
CPP was negative, muscle paralysis, anesthesia, and analgesia were discontinued. Brain
death was confirmed at the end of 60 min of CPP < 0 mmHg and before lung retrieval.
Figure 1 Schematic overview of the experiment flow. Each experiment was run using two animals
(lung donor and transplantation recipient). The donor underwent induction of brain death followed by
organ donor management for a total of 9 h after brain death induction (BD); the lungs were then harvested
and cold-stored for 8 h (Ischemia). The recipient pig underwent pneumonectomy and transplantation of
the left donor lung, post-reperfusion follow-up was carried on for the following 6 hours (Graft). Arrows in
the figure represent the following timings: BD refers to the end of donor management; Ischemia indicates
the end of 8 h of cold storage and Graft the end of 6 h follow-up after graft reperfusion.

Clinical signs of brain death included the absence of corneal reflex and the absence of
coughing in response to tracheal suctioning. An apnea test was also performed. This
was conducted during continuous positive airway pressure verifying the absence of
breathing, confirmed by the absence of esophageal pressure deflections (SmartCath
Viasys, Palm Springs, CA, USA) while pCO2 was above 60 mmHg (verified by arterial
blood gas analysis). In three animals, brain death was also confirmed by electroenceph￾alography (B. E. Light, EBNeuro S.p.A., Florence, Italy) [16]. In these animals, monitor￾ing was extended throughout the protocol procedure, from before brain death
induction to the end of brain death donor management.

brain to inflated balloon proportions (Additional file 4: Figure S3) can be found in
the Additional files.
Organ donor management
After brain death was confirmed, donor animals were treated according to standard physio￾logical targets for the next 6 h [17,18]. Cardiovascular targets included MAP > 60 mmHg,
central venous pressure (CVP) between 5 and 8 mmHg and urine output > 1.5 mL/Kg/h.
Hypotension was treated with vasoactive drugs when hemodynamic instability persisted
despite adequate volume resuscitation. Norepinephrine was the first choice drug when sys￾temic vascular resistances were below 800 dyn · s · cm−5
. 1-Desamino-8-D-arginine vaso￾pressin (0.125 to 0.250 μg endovenous) was given when diabetes insipidus occurred, defined
as urine output > 4 mL/Kg/h, urinary specific gravity < 1.005, and blood osmolarity >
300 mOsm/Kg, calculated as [2 × Na] + [glucose/18]. We decided to use methylpredniso￾lone by protocol (15 mg/kg) but not thyroid hormones as their use is suggested only when
hemodynamic instability persists despite aggressive treatment [19-22]. After brain death
confirmation, mechanical ventilation was set according to a lung-protective ventilatory
strategy [18,23]: tidal volumes of 6 to 8 mL/Kg, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8
to 10 cmH2O, and respiratory rate set to maintain pCO2 lower than 50 mmHg with 7.35 <
pH < 7.45. Recruitment maneuvers were performed at the end of each apnea test allowing
ten consecutive breaths with an inspiratory pressure target of 40 cmH2O above PEEP of 5
cmH2O.
Lung harvest and cold storage
A median sternotomy was performed, the thymus removed, the pleura carefully dis￾sected, and the pericardium opened. The superior and inferior cava veins were
encircled with silk ties and a bolus of 20,000 U heparin (Pharepa, Pharmatex Italia s.
r.l., Milan, Italy) was injected into the jugular vein. Five minutes after the heparin
bolus, a cannula was inserted into the main pulmonary artery. A bolus of 250 μg of
alprostadil (Prostin, Pfizer Manufacturing Belgium N.V., Puurs, Belgium) was then
injected into the main pulmonary artery. The superior and inferior cava veins were
then ligated, the ascending aorta clamped, and the left atrial appendage transected.
The lungs were then flushed with 60 ml/Kg of cold Perfadex® (Vitrolife Sweden In￾struments AB, Billdal, Sweden) at a height of 30 cm above the heart. During the per￾fusion with the preservation solution, respiratory rate was decreased and FiO2
increased to 100%. Ventilation was discontinued when the heart-lung block was re￾moved. Just before removing the lungs, the trachea was clamped with lungs fully in￾flated. After removal from the thoracic cavity, the heart-lung block was placed on
ice, the heart removed and the lung perfused with Perfadex® in a retrograde manner
(i.e., from the left veins to the pulmonary artery). Thereafter, the lungs were placed
in a plastic bag (Vitrolife) containing Perfadex® solution and stored on ice for 8 h
while continuously monitoring lung surface temperature (Medical Temperature
Probes, Siemens S.p.A., Milan, Italy).
Lung transplantation
A detailed description of the surgical procedure of lung transplantation is reported in
Additional file 1. Briefly, the recipient pig was placed in the right lateral decubitus
Valenza et al. Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2014, 2:12 Page 5 of 18
http://www.icm-experimental.com/content/2/1/12

position, a left thoracotomy performed just below the tip of the scapula, and a left
pneumonectomy completed. The donor lung was prepared on the back table while on
ice then transferred to the thoracic cavity, and bronchial, pulmonary artery, and venous
anastomoses were performed. The atrial clamp was then released to de-air the donor
lung in a retrograde manner. Thereafter, the artery clamp was opened step by step in
10 min; the bronchial clamp was then removed allowing left lung ventilation.
Ventilation protocol was as follows: during pneumonectomy tidal volume was set at 6 to
8 mL/Kg, PEEP at 5 cmH2O, and FiO2 at 40%. By protocol, increments of PEEP were
allowed if PaO2 was <100 mmHg or SpO2 < 95%. After reperfusion, pressure-controlled
mode was instituted maintaining the same target volume of 6 to 8 mL/Kg; PEEP was set at
8 cmH2O, and a recruitment maneuver was performed (total target pressure of 45 cmH2O)
45 min after the start of controlled reperfusion. During post-reperfusion follow-up, if SpO2
was <90%, increments of PEEP were allowed up to 15 cmH2O; thereafter, FiO2 had to be
increased in case of persistent hypoxia. Respiratory rate was set to maintain pCO2 below
70 mmHg and/or pH > 7.25. In case of persistent hypercapnia, increases of tidal volume
were allowed. Cardiovascular targets included MAP > 60 mmHg, CVP between 5 and
8 mmHg, and urine output > 1.5 mL/Kg/h; care was given to administer the least amount
of fluid possible. Cardiovascular, respiratory, and metabolic parameters were collected
throughout reperfusion and post-reperfusion follow-up.
Assessment of lung function and gene expression
Oxygenation was assessed measuring partial pressure of oxygen from peripheral arterial
blood samples (PaO2) and calculating the oxygenation index (OI) as (FiO2 × Pawm)/
PaO2, where Pawm is mean airway pressure. The physiologic dead space fraction (VD/
VT) was computed according to the following formula: VD/VT = (PaCO2 − PECO2)/
PaCO2, where PECO2 is the mixed expired carbon dioxide partial pressure obtained by
means of expiratory air sampling [24]. EtCO2/PaCO2 was also calculated. Respiratory
mechanics was assessed partitioning lung and chest wall components by means of an
esophageal balloon catheter, as detailed in the Additional file 1. End-expiratory lung
volume (EELV) was measured using the closed circuit helium technique [25]. As index
of lung edema, EVLW and wet-to-dry lung ratio (W/D) were measured according to
standard procedures (see Additional file 1). Transcriptional expression of tumor necro￾sis factor alpha (TNFα), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interferon
gamma (IFNγ), high mobility group box-1 (HMGB-1), chemokine CC motif ligand-2
(CCL2-MCP-1), chemokine CXC motif ligand-10 (CXCL-10), interleukin-8 (IL-8),
endothelin-1 (EDN-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion
molecule-1 (VCAM-1), and selectin-E (SELE) was evaluated by real-time reverse tran￾scription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis performed on total mRNA isolated
from lung tissue samples [26,27]. A detailed description of the technique of mRNA isola￾tion and gene expression measurement may be found in the Additional file 1.
Statistical analysis
All results are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD), unless otherwise speci￾fied. Continuous variables referring to neurological, cardiovascular, respiratory, and
metabolic function were analyzed within donor or recipient animals by ANOVA for
Valenza et al. Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2014, 2:12 Page 6 of 18
http://www.icm-experimental.com/content/2/1/12

repeated measures followed, were appropriate, by Bonferroni test for all pairwise
multiple comparisons. Data that were not normally distributed were investigated by
ANOVA on ranks followed by Dunn's test for all pairwise comparisons. Parameters
of lung function (PaO2/FiO2, OI, VD/VT, EELV, EVLW, EtCO2/PaCO2) taken before
(baseline) and after BD and after lung transplantation (Graft) were assessed by
means of ANOVA. The gene expression of lung biomarkers and W/D ratio were in￾vestigated at the end of BD, after 8 h of cold storage (Ischemia) and at the end of re￾perfusion follow-up (Graft) by one-way ANOVA and compared to controls (Control).
For this purpose, three sham operated pigs were considered. P < 0.05 was accepted as
significant. Data were analyzed using Sigma Plot version 11.0 (Systat Software, Inc.,
GmbH, Munich, Germany).
Results
A total of ten domestic pigs (five donors and five recipients) were consecutively in￾cluded in the study and investigated as described in Figure 1. Three additional sham￾operated animals were included and their lungs used as controls.
Induction of brain death and donor management
As shown in Figure 2, the inflation of the Foley catheter caused sovratentorial mass ex￾pansion that caused an increase in ICP (Figure 3A) and a decrease in CPP (Figure 3B).
Intracranial compliance significantly dropped from 0.24 ± 0.13 to 0.02 ± 0.01 mL/
mmHg (P < 0.05). When CPP was close to zero, transient hypertension and sustained
tachycardia occurred, followed by severe hypotension (Figure 4). In all donor animals,
clinical signs confirmed brain death at the end of brain death induction and throughout
donor management. A representative pattern of electroencephalogic activity before and
after brain death induction is shown in Additional file 5: Figure S4.
Cardiovascular, respiratory, and metabolic parameters collected during the hours of
donor management are shown in Table 1. Over time, cardiac output significantly rose
(P < 0.05) and (P < 0.05). Volume load (average 8 ± 4 mL/Kg/h) and noradrenaline infu￾sion (average 0.04 ± 0.02 μg/Kg/min) were necessary in all animals. Central venous
pressure slightly rose over time (P < 0.05); stroke volume variation was always within
normal ranges. Lactate rose by the end of donor management (P < 0.05). Atrial fibrilla￾tion occurred in three pigs: infusion of amiodarone (150 mg in 250 mL dextrose 5%
over a period of 20 to 30 min through a central venous catheter) decreased ventricular
rate but did not revert to sinus rhythm. Clear signs of diabetes insipidus occurred in
four out of five cases and were treated with 1-desamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin (1 to
3 μg) [28]. The lung-protective ventilatory strategy set after brain death confirmation
resulted in a higher PEEP level (P < 0.05), lower tidal volume (P < 0.05), and higher re￾spiratory rate (P < 0.05); PaCO2 and pH were not significantly different from baseline,
while EtCO2 was higher (P < 0.05). Insulin administration was necessary to maintain
blood concentrations of glucose to levels that were similar to baseline throughout the
donor management protocol. Hypernatremia developed over time (P < 0.05) and was
associated with a lower concentration of sodium in the collected urine (P < 0.05).
At the end of donor management, hepatic enzymes were not significantly different from
baseline (SGOT 41.4 ± 22 vs. 151.2 ± 130.2 U/L, P = 0.145; SGPT 52.9 ± 10.1 vs. 38.2 ± 14.2
Valenza et al. Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2014, 2:12 Page 7 of 18
http://www.icm-experimental.com/content/2/1/12

U/L, P = 0.124); creatinine and BUN were slightly but significantly higher (creatinine 1.1 ± 0.1
vs. 1.5 ± 0.2 mg/dL, P < 0.05; BUN 14.2 ± 2.2 vs. 36.5 ± 5.26 mg/dL, P < 0.05); there was a
trend towards a rise of cardiac troponin T (10.5 ± 10.8 vs. 31.6 ± 15.2 pg/mL, P = 0.082).
Lung harvest, preservation, and transplantation
There were no complications concomitant to lung perfusion, harvest, and back table surgery.
Temperature of the graft was always below 8°C during cold preservation. Time from cross
clamp to reperfusion was 569 ± 28 min, of which 470 ± 24 min of cold and 98 ± 14 min of
warm ischemia, respectively. Surgery was accomplished without major complications. Re￾spiratory and hemodynamic data in the recipient are shown in Table 2; the data referring to
the controlled reperfusion are shown in Additional file 6: Table S1 of the supplement mater￾ial. Positive end-expiratory pressure was increased over time after reperfusion (P < 0.05).

decrease of CPP (B) during the induction of brain death and during donor management are shown in the
figure. The error bars show the standard deviation of the mean.
Valenza et al. Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2014, 2:12 Page 8 of 18
http://www.icm-experimental.com/content/2/1/12

Mean arterial pressure and cardiac output progressively dropped (both P < 0.05). Lactate did
not change over time, and no signs of inadequate perfusion were present.
Assessment of lung function and gene expression
Table 3 shows functional respiratory parameters in the donor and recipient animals.
The ratio between EtCO2 and PaCO2, elastance of the respiratory system, EELV and
functional dead space were not significantly different at BD or at Graft. There were no
signs of lung edema in either BD or Graft, as assessed by EVLW and W/D lung ratio.
In three cases, oxygenation of the implanted lung (Graft) was assessed after reperfusion
by selective left pulmonary vein and artery blood gas analysis: arterial PaO2/FiO2 was
532 ± 19 mmHg with PvO2 of 34 ± 5 mmHg.

considered, a statistically significant difference was found (P < 0.05). To isolate the group or groups that differ from the
others, a multiple comparison procedure was used (Bonferroni t test). The statistical software we used (Sigma Stat) is such
that when no significant difference is found between the two groups with the higher difference of mean values, a result
of ‘Do Not Test’ is provided by Bonferroni t test for the all other enclosed comparison. A ‘Do Not Test’ should be treated
as if there is no significant difference between the means, even though the ANOVA test indicates that this is the case.
This apparent discrepancy is due to the fact that differences are close to significance (P = 0.06) but below threshold
(set at 0.05). This result may therefore be considered only as a nonsignificant trend.

Discussion
This study describes a pig model of brain death, donor management, and lung trans￾plantation that closely resembles clinical conditions. The research effort was to repro￾duce each critical phase of donation and transplantation in a standardized and
optimized fashion and to integrate the clinical approach with biofunctional evidence of
lung injury.
Apart from decapitation [29] and cerebral hemorrhage [30], most of the animal inves￾tigations on brain death have utilized models of sovratentorial mass expansion to rise
ICP [26,31-36]. While Neyrinck et al. and Ryan et al. induced brain death by an explo￾sive rise of ICP [34,35], we elected to rise ICP slowly reproducing the protocol recently
described by Purins et al. [15]. The model we used resembles that of a progressively
expanding mass that brings to complete ischemia. Despite the specific limitations of an
animal model, it could resemble an ICP rise that would occur in case of an untreated
trauma or a spontaneous cerebral hemorrhage.
Increased intracranial pressure was associated with a decrease in CPP and a drop of
intracranial compliance. Similarly to Purins et al., ICP rise was associated with a transient
hypertension and tachycardia, followed by severe hypotension. These phenomena occurred
at CPP values similar to those recently described in a refinement paper of Purins et al. [33],
further confirming the validity of the model. In our model, clinical signs of brain death were
evident after 1 h of negative CPP in all animals, including assessment of corneal reflex,
coughing in response to tracheal suctioning and execution of an apnea test. Moreover, in a
subset of animals, the absence of brain perfusion was confirmed by electroencephalography.
Intracranial pressure and CPP were maintained for an extended number of hours to
better reproduce the clinical setting. This is a major distinction relative to previous in￾vestigations. Indeed, observation times after brain death were 120 min in Purins' re￾search [15], 300 in Neyrinck [34]; 360 in Lyons [31], McLean [32], and Barklin [26],

and 480 in Hvas [30]. We prolonged the time from brain death to lung harvested after
a total of 540 min after cerebral mass expansion. Even if this time was not as long as
that of the investigation of Stieger et al.'s [37], this protracted period allowed to confirm
brain death over time and opened to the long-term pathophysiological sequelae of brain
death adding to the clinical relevance of the model. In fact, typical cardiovascular, meta￾bolic, and electrolyte derangements of brain death overtly occurred. A distinctive fea￾ture of this study is that we treated brain death according to standard clinical practice
adopting well-accepted physiological targets [17,18], whereas others did not [34,36]. In
fact, after brain death induction, there was cardiovascular instability, including a pro￾gressive drop of systemic vascular resistance and a rise of cardiac output that required
vasoactive drugs and a positive fluid balance for normalization. To optimize ventilatory
management, a lung-protective ventilatory bundle of treatment was adopted

comprehensive of high PEEP - low tidal volume, apnea test execution during continu￾ous positive airway pressure - CPAP, and lung recruitment maneuvers. As shown by
Mascia et al. [23], this strategy likely contributed to prevent lung collapse and allowed
to meet standard inclusion criteria for lung donation in all animals: mean PaO2/FiO2 at
PEEP 5 cmH2O and FiO2 100% was 480 ± 31 mmHg, well above the conventional
threshold for acceptability set at 300 mmHg [2,38]. Overall, management of pigs after
brain death closely mimicked the clinical challenge of treating the multi-organ donors,
thus offering a standardized point of reference.
While previous research has generally focused attention on either the donor or the reci￾pient side, we have accurately reproduced the entire process of organ donation and trans￾plantation. After brain death induction and donor treatment, the lungs were retrieved and
cold-stored for 8 h. This time interval represents a realistic frame for potential lung preser￾vation and/or reconditioning strategies. Similar to other investigations, we have then used a
single lung transplantation procedure [39,40]. Lung function early after reperfusion has
been carefully monitored, as reperfusion injury is generally considered an outcome measure
in lung preservation studies [41]. For this reason, based on the known effects of perfusion
and ventilation on ischemia-reperfusion lung injury [42,43], meticulous attention was given
to the reperfusion protocol. The clamp on pulmonary artery was opened stepwise to allow
progressive accommodation of blood flow in the newly reperfused lung vasculature and to
limit as much as possible shear stress forces. This procedure also contributed to dilute re￾sidual unflushed organic acid accumulated within the lung during warm ischemia, possibly
dumping the systemic effects of reperfusion. During the first minutes of reperfusion, the
ventilatory component of reperfusion injury was completely abolished. Ventilation was in
fact resumed only 15 min after reperfusion. At this time, attention was given to avoid
ventilator-induced lung injury: a low volume - high PEEP strategy was adopted, recruitment
maneuver was postponed, and residual atelectasis initially tolerated to avoid stress load to
the endothelial-epithelial barrier likely to occur at high end-inspiratory lung volumes. While
tolerating relative hypoxia, oxygen inspiratory fraction was kept in the low range to avoid
oxidative stress [44]. These targets were only transiently set, and a full open lung strategy
was resumed within 45 min. We adopted this strategy based on the opinion that a slow
transition from ischemia to reperfusion is of primary importance to modulate both endo￾thelial and epithelial ischemia-reperfusion injury in the lung.
Careful titration of pre-load indexes and ventilation settings was also adopted during
post-reperfusion follow-up. This allowed to terminate the experiments with the im￾planted lung free of edema, as assessed by wet-to-dry lung ratio, and with normal
extravascular lung water and oxygenation indexes. While other assessed the function of
the implanted lung by blood gas analysis after ligation of the contralateral pulmonary
artery, we implemented a different strategy. Indeed, the stress test given by the entire
cardiac output flowing through a recently ischemic lung is certainly useful to reveal a
possible frailty of the implanted lung. However, such evaluation protocol imposes an
innatural hemodynamic challenge to both pulmonary vasculature and right heart that
often leads to severe hemodynamic failure. There are in fact authors that report death
at reperfusion, early after contralateral pulmonary artery ligation [45-47]. We believe
that selective lung arterial and venous blood gas analysis accurately assess lung function
without hemodynamic confounding factors. A limitation of this approach is that mea￾sures of respiratory mechanics reflect both native lung and graft. However, avoidance
Valenza et al. Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2014, 2:12 Page 14 of 18
http://www.icm-experimental.com/content/2/1/12

of the stress hemodynamic test allowed to better investigate the biology of ischemia￾reperfusion lung injury.
In this perspective, it is interesting to note that even if all efforts to gently treat the
lungs were adopted and physiological endpoints were successfully pursued during
donor treatment and after transplantation, there was a clear activation of inflammation
in the lung [48,49]. In a clinical setting, achievement of these physiological parameters
at the end of donor or recipient treatment would be certainly satisfactory. However, in
spite of this excellent clinical outcome, enhanced expression of the chemokines CCL2-
MCP-1 and IL-8 as well as increased transcription of SELE at different phases of the
transplantation process suggest the presence of an inflammatory reaction [50]. Of par￾ticular interest, increased expression of IL-8 occurred during donor management. This
observation confirms the idea that brain death per se induces inflammation in periph￾eral organs [51,52]. Indeed, increased production of the neutrophil chemoattractant IL￾8 after brain death can facilitate subsequent reperfusion injury. In addition, increased
chemokine production at the Graft point can promote rejection. Of note, our reperfu￾sion strategy protected against oxidative injury, as suggested by HMGB-1 downregula￾tion [53,54].
Mascia et al. showed that a conventional strategy of lung management during brain death
was associated with a rise of plasma cytokines over time, while a protective strategy was not
[23]. Here, we show that a lung-protective ventilation throughout brain death donor man￾agement and transplantation did not prevent the activation of inflammation in the lung.
Both findings underscore the complexity of the interaction between ischemia-reperfusion
and mechanical ventilation in lung transplantation and call to the need for reliable models
that reproduce each phase of lung donation and transplantation. In fact, an increasing num￾ber of transplantations are performed with lungs from marginal donors, and the complex
clinical settings often preclude full understanding of new treatment modalities cause-effect
relationships.
There are some limitations to the study. In fact, the model resembles that of a pro￾gressively expanding mass that brings to complete ischemia, but only under the specific
limitations of an animal model. The model is reproducible and with low variablity, yet
some differences between animals are present (see atrial fibrillation that occurred in
three animals, for instance). The animals investigated are enough to conclude about the
validity of the model, but we realize that the absolute number is low, with some reflec￾tions to statistical results.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we have set a pig model that closely resembles the entire process of organ
donation and lung transplantation, and we have shown that activation of inflammation in
the lung was present despite of an optimized ventilatory management throughout the
protocol. The findings of our investigation may represent a starting point for various studies
of lung transplantation in a standardized setting.
