Abstract
Objective Despite improvements in its management, 
infective endocarditis (IE) is associated with poor survival. 
The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of a 
multidisciplinary endocarditis team (ET), including a 
cardiologist, microbiologist and a cardiac surgeon, on the 
outcome of patients with acute IE according to medical or 
surgical treatment strategies.
Methods We conducted an observational before-and￾after study of 196 consecutive patients with definite IE, 
who were treated at a tertiary reference centre between 
2009 and 2015. The study was divided into two periods: 
period 1, before the formation of the ET (n=101), and 
period 2, after the formation of the ET (n=95). The role of 
the ET included regular multidisciplinary team meetings 
to confirm diagnosis, inform the type and duration of 
antibiotic therapy and recommend early surgery, when 
indicated, according to European guidelines.
Results The patient demographics and predisposing 
conditions for IE were comparable between the two study 
periods. In the time period following the introduction of the 
ET, there was a reduction in both the time to commencement 
of IE-specific antibiotic therapy (4.0±4.0 days vs 2.5±3.2 
days; P=0.004) and the time from suspected IE to surgery 
(7.8±7.3 days vs 5.3±4.2 days; P=0.004). A 12-month 
Kaplan-Meier survival for patients managed medically 
was 42.9% in the pre-ET period and 66.7% in the post-ET 
period (P=0.03). The involvement of the ET was a significant 
independent predictor of 1-year survival in patients managed 
medically (HR 0.24, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.87; P=0.03).
Conclusions A standardised multidisciplinary team 
approach may lead to earlier diagnosis of IE, more 
appropriate individualised management strategies, 
expedited surgery, where indicated, and improved survival 
in those patients chosen for medical management, 
supporting the recent change in guidelines to recommend 
the use of a multidisciplinary team in the care of patients 
with IE.
Introduction
Despite improvements in its management, 
infective endocarditis (IE) is associated with 
substantial morbidity and poor survival, 
with a 14%–22% in-hospital and up to 40% 
1-year mortality.1–3 Prompt diagnosis, antibi￾otic therapy and early surgical intervention, 
when indicated, have been shown to improve 
survival.4 5 Despite this, the diagnosis may be 
delayed6
 and patients may not receive surgery 
even when indicated.7
 Unsurprisingly, guide￾line non-compliance has been shown to be 
associated with worse outcome.8
To facilitate complex decision-making, a 
multidisciplinary team (MDT) approach may 
support the management of patients with IE. 
While this team-based approach has already 
been shown to improve clinical care of 
patients with chronic valvular heart disease,9

Key questions
What is already known about this subject?
► Despite improvements in its management, infective 
endocarditis (IE) is associated with substantial 
morbidity and poor survival. While current European 
Society of Cardiology recommendations support 
the use of a multidisciplinary team approach to 
improve the management of patients with IE, data 
in this area are limited.
What does this study add?
► A standardised multidisciplinary team approach 
may lead to earlier diagnosis of IE, more 
appropriate individualised management strategies, 
expedited surgery, where indicated, and improved 
survival in those patients chosen for medical 
management.
How might this impact on clinical practice?
► These data provide preliminary evidence to support 
the recent change in guidelines to recommend 
the use of a multidisciplinary team in the care of 
patients with IE.

especially in the selection of patients with severe aortic 
stenosis for transcatheter aortic valve implantation proce￾dures,10 this approach is not yet common for IE despite 
recent recommendations. The present European Society 
of Cardiology (ESC) Task Force on IE supports the eval￾uation and management of patients with IE in reference 
centres by a specialised MDT consisting of a cardiologist, 
microbiologist, imaging specialist and a cardiac surgeon 
(the ‘Endocarditis Team’ (ET)).11 The role of the ET 
includes regular meetings in order to make prompt diag￾noses, choose the type and duration of antibiotic therapy 
and to facilitate early surgery in those patients with a clear 
indication. Recently, it has been reported that a team￾based approach reduced 1-year mortality from 18.5% 
to 8.2% in a mixed cohort of medically and surgically 
managed patients with IE.12
A formal ET approach to managing patients with IE 
was introduced at our hospital in 2012. The aim of this 
study was to evaluate the impact of an MDT management 
approach on the outcome of patients with IE according 
to medical or surgical treatment strategies.
Methods
Study patients
We conducted an observational before-and-after study of 
196 consecutive patients with definite acute IE, according 
to the modified Duke criteria,13 who were treated at King’s 
College Hospital, a tertiary reference centre. The study 
was divided into two periods: period 1, before the forma￾tion of the ET (August 2009 to June 2012), and period 2, 
after the formation of the ET (July 2012 to April 2015).
Demographic, clinical, microbiological, imaging and 
surgical data were collected prospectively on a computer 
database. Biochemical data were taken at the time of 
patient admission. Predisposing conditions included 
dental or surgical intervention within the past 12 months, 
intravenous drug abuse, history of IE or heart valve disor￾ders (rheumatic disease, prosthetic valve or valve repair). 
Vascular and immunological phenomena (glomerulone￾phritis, Osler nodes, Roth spots and rheumatoid factor) 
were defined according to recent ESC guidance.11 Uncon￾trolled sepsis was defined as having persistent infection 
or signs of locally uncontrolled infection as defined by 
European guidance.11 Persistent infection consisted of 
fever and persistent positive cultures after 7–10 days of 
appropriate antibiotic treatment.
Multidisciplinary management approach
Each patient with suspected IE was initially discussed with 
the cardiology team and underwent a transthoracic echo￾cardiogram (TTE) (figure 1). A transoesophageal echo￾cardiogram (TOE) was performed following the TTE if 
study quality was poor or if valvular complications were 
suspected. The patient was also discussed with the micro￾biology team and blood cultures taken. If there was a high 
clinical suspicion of IE, the case was then referred to the 
ET. The ET consisted of two cardiologists, one microbiol￾ogist, one cardiac imaging specialist, one cardiac surgeon 
and an IE specialist nurse coordinator.
New referrals to the ET were discussed immediately 
after presentation, existing cases at a once-weekly MDT 
meeting and all cases were reviewed on twice-weekly ward

rounds and board rounds led by a consultant microbi￾ologist and cardiologist. The purpose of this collabora￾tive evaluation was to initially characterise patients as 
definite, probable or excluded cases of IE, as defined by 
the modified Duke criteria,13 and to subsequently obtain 
a consensus on the type, duration and mode of antibi￾otic therapy. Risk of systemic embolisation, progressive 
heart failure and irreversible structural damage due to 
severe infection were assessed in accordance with Euro￾pean guidance to determine if there was an indication 
for early surgery.11 All patients requiring surgery were 
broadly categorised according to indication (embolic, 
infectious or haemodynamic) and timing (emergency, 
within 24 hours; urgent, within a few days; elective, after 
1–2 weeks of antibiotic therapy).11 Time to surgery was 
defined as the time from suspected IE to the operative 
procedure. Medical therapy was indicated for those at 
lower risk, or those patients deemed unfit for surgery. 
Patients were monitored for medical therapy failure and 
the development of indications for surgical intervention. 
The clinical course was evaluated daily by the ward team 
and reviewed by the ET on a twice-weekly ward round. All 
patients were followed up at 1, 6 and 12 months following 
discharge from hospital at an endocarditis clinic run by 
the ET in the outpatient setting.
Statistical analysis
Clinical, microbiological and outcome data were compared 
between the two study periods (pre-ET vs post-ET). We 
subsequently compared these data according to manage￾ment strategy (medical, surgical, medical (surgical turn￾down)). Patients who were managed surgically following an 
initial period of medical therapy were coded in the surgical 
strategy group. Categorical data are expressed as absolute 
and relative frequency and compared using the χ2
test with 
Yates’ correction or Fisher’s exact test. Parametric data are 
presented as mean (SD) and analysed using t-test. Cox 
proportional hazards regression modelling was used to eval￾uate the independent contribution of the ET and various 
clinical parameters on in-hospital and 12-month mortality 
for all patients and according to each management strategy. 
Each variable was first entered into a univariate model, 
and those found to be significant at a level of P<0.20 were 
then entered into a stepwise forward multivariate model. 
For mortality analysis, with no loss to follow-up prior to 
hospital discharge, the Χ2 test was used to compare in-hos￾pital morality rates between the pre-ET and post-ET groups. 
With loss to follow-up accounted for as censored events, the 
Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate 1-year survival 
between the pre-ET and post-ET groups, with differences 
between the curves evaluated with the log-rank statistic. 
SPSS (V.21.0; SPSS) was used for statistical analysis.

patients to IE were comparable between the two study 
periods (table 1). The pattern of infection did not alter with

regard to causative organism or valves infected. No differ￾ence in complications, including congestive cardiac failure 
(16.8% vs 15.8%, P=1.00) and acute stroke (21.8% vs 20.0%, 
P=0.86), was observed between the pre-ET and post-ET 
study periods (table 2). A distinction was made between the 
complications occurring before or after the involvement of 
the ET during the post-ET period (table 2). Just over half of 
all embolic events were observed prior to the involvement 
of the ET (57% for acute stroke and 52% for other emboli). 
Data on survival at 1year were not obtainable for three and 
two patients in the pre-ET and post-ET groups, respectively.
In both time periods, less than 10% of patients had an 
appropriate indication for surgery, however, were deemed 
unfit for surgery and managed medically due to a combi￾nation of reasons including a high logistic EuroSCORE, 
multiple comorbidities, haemodynamic instability due to 
severe sepsis or congestive cardiac failure, active malig￾nancy or major neurological deficit following a stroke.
Distribution and outcomes in all patients
The distribution of patients according to management 
strategy was similar between the two study periods, with 
approximately three-quarters of patients managed surgi￾cally. Indications for surgery were broadly categorised 
into three groups (online supplementary figure 1). There 
was a higher proportion of patients who were deemed to 
have uncontrolled infection as an indication for surgery 
in the post-ET than in the pre-ET period (pre-ET 30% vs 
post-ET 48%; P=0.03).
In the time period following the introduction of the 
ET, there was a significant reduction in both the time 
from admission to TTE and the time from TTE to TOE, 
if indicated (table 2). In addition, there was a reduc￾tion in the time to commencement of IE-specific anti￾biotic therapy (4.0±4.0 days vs 2.5±3.2 days; P=0.004). 
Overall, there was also a reduction in the mean dura￾tion of inpatient stay by 18% during the post-ET period 
(29.2±15.9 days vs 23.9±15.6 days; P=0.02). While there 
was a trend towards a reduction in in-hospital mortality 
(17.5% to 12.6%) during the post-ET period, this did 
not reach statistical significance (table 2). A 12-month 
Kaplan-Meier survival was 69.3% in the pre-ET period 
and 76.8% in the post-ET period (P=0.25) in all patients.

Valvular heart disease
Distribution and outcomes according to management strategy
The distribution of patient demographics, clinical char￾acteristics, vegetation localisation on echocardiography 
and causative organisms were comparable between 
the pre-ET and post-ET time periods according to 
management strategy (online supplementary table 1). 
In comparison to the pre-ET period, there was a trend 
towards a reduction in both the time from suspected IE 
to TTE and time to TOE following TTE imaging in the 
post-ET period, in all three management strategy groups; 
however, statistical significance was only achieved in the 
group of patients managed surgically (table 3). There 
was an approximately 15% increase in the proportion of 
patients undergoing TOE imaging in the surgical group, 
prior to surgery, following the involvement of the ET 
(P=0.04).
In the pre-ET period, there was a higher proportion 
of patients with uncontrolled sepsis who were managed 
medically rather than surgically (33.3% vs 10.8%; 
P=0.04). The IE sequelae did not alter between the two 
time periods although the rate of uncontrolled sepsis 
was significantly higher in those patients who underwent 
surgery in the post-ET time period (10.8% vs 27.0%; 
P=0.03).
In the time period following the introduction of the 
ET, there was a reduction in the time from suspected 
IE to surgery (7.8±7.3 days vs 5.3±4.2 days; P=0.004) 
(table 3). The distribution of patients according to indi￾cation for timing of surgery, according to European guid￾ance, was similar between the pre-ET and post-ET periods 
(online supplementary table 2). Overall, there were more 
patients who satisfied guideline recommendations for 
timing for surgery in the post-ET period (pre-ET vs post￾ET; 79.7% vs 92.1%; P=0.05).
There was an approximately 25% reduction in the dura￾tion of inpatient stay for surgical patients (pre-ET vs post￾ET; 31.4±14.5days vs 24.3±12.6 days; P=0.003) (table 3). 
While there was a trend towards a reduction in the risk 
of in-hospital mortality following the inception of the 
ET in both the surgical and medical groups, this did not 
reach statistical significance with χ2 analysis. A 12-month 
Kaplan-Meier survival was 42.9% in the pre-ET period 
and 66.7% in the post-ET period (P=0.03) for patients 
managed medically and 81.1% in the pre-ET period and 
85.7% in the post-ET period (P=0.51) for patients who 
underwent surgery (figure 2). The amount and pattern of 
loss to follow-up, or censored events, was similar between 
the comparison groups.
Predictors of mortality
All demographic, clinical and relevant outcome 
data which were significant in a univariate model 
(online supplementary tables 3 and 4) were subse￾quently entered into a multivariate model to determine 
the predictors of 1-year mortality. For patients managed 
surgically, greater age, lower estimated glomerular filtra￾tion rate, lower haemoglobin and delay in surgery were 
all associated with a worse 1-year survival in multivariate 
analysis (table 4). Patients with native valve endocar￾ditis had better survival than those with prosthetic valve 
endocarditis. A higher serum neutrophil count and an 
acute stoke were both identified as independent predic￾tors of a worse 1-year mortality in patients managed 
medically. The involvement of the ET was a significant 
independent predictor of improved 1-year survival in 
patients managed medically (HR 0.24, 95% CI 0.07 to 
0.87; P=0.03) (table 4).
Discussion
The present study shows a reduction in all-cause mortality 
over 12 months in patients with IE who were managed 
medically following the formation of the ET, suggesting 
an important impact of an MDT approach to patient 
management. A similar MDT approach has been shown 
to decrease 1-year mortality from 18.5% to 8.2% in all 
patients with IE,12 an effect also seen in other studies.14 In 
contrast to these studies, our analysis specifically identi￾fied the impact of the ET approach stratified by manage￾ment approach. The in-hospital mortality of patients with 
IE has been shown to vary from 15% to 30%.2 15–18 In our 
study, the in-hospital mortality for medically and surgi￾cally managed patients is one of the lowest reported, at 
8.3% and 9.5%, respectively, with the in-hospital mortality 
for all patients at 12.6%.
Although it is difficult to confirm a direct relation￾ship between the lower mortality in medically managed 
patients and the inception of the ET, intrinsic differences 
between the two patient populations are unlikely to be 
responsible for this improved outcome. Patients managed 
medically during both time periods had similar demo￾graphic and clinical characteristics, and also had similar 
complication rates. The ET involvement in the medi￾cally managed cohort was an independent predictor of 
improved survival in this cohort at 1 year. The improved 
outcome of medically managed patients with IE observed 
at our centre could be attributed to the additional clin￾ical experience acquired over time by the cardiologists, 
microbiologists and cardiac surgeons, and closer collab￾oration as part of the ET. An initial MDT evaluation 
allows for the identification of those patients at high risk 
of serious complications, and consequently those who 
would benefit from earlier surgical intervention or more 
aggressive medical/antibiotic management. In this way, 
the MDT approach offers the potential to alter the clin￾ical course of the disease.4
Prior to the inception of the ET, there was a higher 
proportion of patients with uncontrolled sepsis who were 
managed medically than surgically. Uncontrolled infec￾tion or severe sepsis is the second most frequent cause 
for early surgical intervention in patients with IE.19 In 
comparison to the pre-ET period, a higher proportion 
of patients with uncontrolled sepsis underwent surgery 
after the introduction of the ET. The better survival in 
the medical therapy group may therefore have resulted 
from improved patient selection for surgery in the

post-ET period, while at the same time the mortality in 
the surgical subgroup was not negatively affected.
In this study, following the introduction of the ET, the 
rate of surgery declined from 73.3% to 66.0%. Despite 
this, the rate of surgery was high in comparison to previous 
studies (from 40% to 50%).20–22 The high rate of surgery 
in the pre-ET period may reflect a lower threshold for 
surgical intervention due to less rigid selection policies 
in comparison to the MDT approach adopted to patient 
selection for surgery in the post-ET period. Despite guide￾line recommendations on surgery in IE management, 
the indications for surgery and its timing are difficult 
decisions to reach without close collaboration between 
the cardiologist, cardiothoracic surgeon and microbiolo￾gist.11 Our in-hospital mortality of 9.5% following surgery 
is on the lower end of the 10%–20% mortality, which has 
been previously reported for patients with acute IE who 
were managed surgically.23 As previously reported, those 
patients who had a clear indication, but were considered 
surgically unfit (and were therefore medically managed), 
had the worst outcomes.24
Rapid identification of patients with IE who are at 
highest risk for death may provide an opportunity to alter 
the clinical course of the disease process and improve 
prognosis. We identified a number of clinical predictors 
of mortality, including patient factors, such as older age, 
prosthetic valve endocarditis and renal failure, as well 
as non-cardiac complications, such as acute stroke, find￾ings consistent with other reports in the literature.11 17 25
Among patients who were medically managed, involve￾ment of the ET was associated with an approximately 
75% lower chance of 1-year mortality. In patients who 
were managed surgically, a delay in surgery from day 
of suspected IE was associated with worse in-hospital 
and 1-year survival. There are data demonstrating that 
outcome is worse if surgery is delayed, in cases in which 
surgery is clinically indicated.4 6 26
During the post-ET period, there was a 40% reduction 
in the time to surgery (from a mean of 8 to 5 days) from 
the date of suspected IE. While the distribution of patients 
according to indication for timing of surgery, according 
to European guidance, was similar between the pre-ET 
and post-ET periods, deviation from timing recommen￾dations was significantly worse in the pre-ET period. The 
overall 92% compliance with timing recommendations 
for surgery in the post-ET period further highlights the 
improved communication between the cardiologists and 
cardiothoracic surgeons.

Operative Risk Evaluation; IE, infective endocarditis. 
Relative to the pre-ET period, there was a significant 
rise in the proportion of patients undergoing TOE 
imaging, in the post-ET period, to aid with the diag￾nosis of mechanical complications such as abscess or 
valve dehiscence. In addition, we observed a significant 
reduction in the time to TOE imaging, following a TTE, 
from 5 days to 3.5 days. While the average time to TOE 
seems relatively long, at 3.5 days in the post-ET group, the 
waiting time was as short as 2.5 days in those who went 
on to have surgery, reflecting appropriate risk stratifica￾tion of requests for TOE imaging for those suspected of 
having a potential indication for surgery. Initial MDT 
evaluation was therefore pivotal in both identifying those 
patients who may benefit from surgery, and facilitating 
appropriate investigations to define those with potential 
surgical indications.
Although there was a non-significant trend towards a 
reduction in mortality in the surgical cohort following 
the introduction of the ET, these results did not reach 
statistical significance. This is most likely explained by 
the fact that our surgical approach to acute IE has not 
changed during the study period. The goal during surgery 
is to radically excise the infected tissue and reconstruct 
cardiac morphology, including repairing or replacing the 
affected valve(s) with replacement of the aortic root, if 
necessary.27 28
Importantly, there was a reduction in the mean dura￾tion of length of hospital stay by 20% during the post-ET 
period from approximately 30 days to 24 days. This may 
somewhat be due to a significant reduction in the time to 
surgery in the surgical cohort, with an associated reduc￾tion in the total duration of patient stay. While there 
may be financial as well as clinical benefits with the MDT 
approach, there is a need to consider the costs of adminis￾tering, preparing for and attending MDT meetings when 
evaluating cost-effectiveness. An MDT approach has been 
shown to be cost-effective in delivering inpatient and 
ambulatory care to patients with heart failure.29 30 Further

studies aimed at understanding the cost-effectiveness of 
the MDT approach to IE care are required.
Study limitations
This study has several potential limitations. First, it is 
a single-centre observational study and at risk of the 
inherent bias of this type of study. Second, although we 
included data on 196 consecutive patients with IE with 
53 deaths at 12 months, our population is relatively 
small, therefore increasing the risk of a type II error 
and of an underestimation of further potential benefits 
derived from the ET. Third, although our study favour￾ably reflects data from a relatively short time period in 
comparison to previous studies, variations in epidemi￾ology and temporal improvements in clinical care may 
have affected the results. Fourth, given the observational 
design of our study, it is not possible to establish the 
cause of death for all patients as well as ascertain a direct 
causal relationship between the reduction in mortality in 
patients with IE managed medically with the introduction 
of the ET. Given the number of comparisons performed 
there is an inherent risk of type 1 error.
Conclusions
A standardised MDT approach may lead to earlier diag￾nosis of IE, more appropriate individualised manage￾ment strategies, expedited surgery, where indicated, and 
improved survival in those patients chosen for medical 
management. Furthermore, the care from the ET was 
identified as a predictor of survival in patients managed 
medically. While surgery should be liberally considered 
according to guideline recommendations, medical 
management in appropriately selected patients is feasible 
with excellent outcomes if patients are under close 
observation. These data provide preliminary evidence to 
support the recent change in guidelines to recommend 
the use of an MDT in the care of patients with IE.
