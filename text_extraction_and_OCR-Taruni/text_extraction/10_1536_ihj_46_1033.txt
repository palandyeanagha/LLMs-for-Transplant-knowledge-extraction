SUMMARY
Although interferon (IFN) shows cardiotoxicity and arrhythmogenesis, the influence
of IFN on signal-averaged electrocardiography remains to be clarified. The aim of this
study was to test a clinical hypothesis that IFN therapy for hepatitis C virus may induce
ventricular late potentials (LPs) and related arrhythmias in patients with chronic active
hepatitis. Signal-averaged and ambulatory electrocardiograms were recorded sequentially
in patients with chronic active hepatitis C (n = 22) throughout the entire period of IFN
therapy. The filtered QRS duration (fQRS) and low amplitude (< 40 µV) signal duration
(LAS40) were significantly increased (95.5 ± 8.5 to 99.6 ± 9.4 msec, P < 0.0001, and 32.8
± 3.1 to 36.3 ± 3.0 msec, P < 0.0001, respectively), whereas the root mean square voltage
in the terminal 40 msec of the fQRS (RMS40) was significantly decreased (25.5 ± 5.4 to
22.3 ± 5.2 µV, P < 0.005) 1 month after starting the IFN therapy. The ventricular LP was
negative in all subjects before starting therapy, but became positive in 7 patients after the
therapy commenced. There were no differences in clinical baseline characteristics
between the LP-positive (n = 7) and LP-negative (n = 15) groups. Significant increases
in mean heart rate, fQRS, and LAS40 were observed after starting the therapy, irrespec￾tive of the appearance of the ventricular LP, whereas a decrease in RMS40 was observed
only in the LP-positive group. No sustained ventricular arrhythmias were documented in
the ambulatory electrocardiography and no cardiac events were encountered in the follow￾up period. Therefore, the results indicate a reversible and subclinical risk of IFN-induced
arrhythmogenesis. (Int Heart J 2005; 46: 1033-1040)

effects1) such as cardiac dysfunction,2) cardiomyopathy,3) various kinds of
arrhythmias,4) and sudden cardiac death,5) although clinical traits which evoke
these cardiac events are not documented. In conjunction with these reports, our
recent study revealed that human recombinant IFN-α induced conduction slow￾ing and ventricular arrhythmias in isolated and in vivo rat hearts.6)
Ventricular late potentials (LPs), evaluated by signal-averaged electrocar￾diography (SAECG), are useful for detecting intraventricular slow or fragmented
conduction, which is one of the major arrhythmogenic substrates and otherwise
can not be detected noninvasively.7) The aim of this study was, therefore, to test a
clinical hypothesis that IFN therapy for hepatitis C virus may induce ventricular
arrhythmogenesis reflected by ventricular LPs and evoke related arrhythmias in
patients with chronic active hepatitis.
METHODS
Patients: A total of 22 consecutive patients (17 men and 5 women; mean age, 48
± 6 years, range, 33 to 59 years) with chronic active hepatitis were enrolled in this
study between February 1998 and December 2001. A diagnosis of chronic active
hepatitis was made based on the results of biochemical, histological, and serolog￾ical examinations, including increased antibody and RNA levels for hepatitis C
virus in the pretreatment serum. None of the patients had complained of cardio￾vascular symptoms. The clinical findings, in addition to routine cardiac examina￾tions such as standard ECG, chest X-rays, and transthoracic echocardiography,
indicated no structural heart diseases in any of these patients.
Protocols: SAECGs were prospectively recorded with a vector magnitude
method (VCM-3000, Fukuda Denshi Inc, Tokyo, Japan) and analyzed in a time￾domain manner. Signal averaging was performed using the 3 standard bipolar
orthogonal X, Y, and Z leads until a noise level of less than 0.5 µV was reached.
Two hundred consecutive sinus beats triggered by an R wave were acquired, dig￾itized, and filtered using a bidirectional digital filter with a bandpass of 40-250
Hz. Data acquisition was performed automatically with a QRS morphology iden￾tification correlation coefficient greater than 0.98. Three parameters related to the
ventricular LP were calculated by an automated algorithm, ie, filtered QRS dura￾tion (fQRS, msec), root mean square voltage in the terminal 40 msec of the fQRS
complex (RMS40, µV), and low amplitude (< 40 µV) signal duration (LAS40,
msec). LP in the time-domain analysis was considered to be positive when at least
two of the following three conditions met the criteria: fQRS > 120 msec, RMS40
< 20 µV, and LAS40 > 38 msec.8)
Practical SAECG recording was performed with the subjects in a supine
position after 10 minutes of bed rest. SAECGs were recorded before, 1 week, and

1 month after starting the IFN therapy in the morning (10:00 to 11:00 AM), to
avoid the IFN-induced febrile period. Two-channel ambulatory ECG (Fukuda
Denshi) monitoring was performed immediately after SAECG recording in all
subjects. A subcutaneous injection of IFN (human recombinant type αIIa or αIIb)
was administered every day during the 2 week hospitalization period and contin￾ued thereafter three times a week in the outpatient clinic for 5 months. In 10
patients SAECGs were also recorded in the outpatient clinic after the cessation of
IFN therapy.
Ethics: This prospective study conformed strictly to the Declaration of Helsinki
II and the study protocol was approved by the local ethics committee. Written
informed consent was obtained from each participant at the time of enrollment in
the study.
Statistics: Data are expressed as the mean ± SD. Statistical analysis was per￾formed using the paired or unpaired Student's t-test, as appropriate. Scattered val￾ues, such as the frequency of premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), are
expressed logarithmically, and P < 0.05 was considered to be statistically signif￾icant.
RESULTS
In the pretreatment period, the antibody for hepatitis C virus was positive
and RNA of this virus was detectable in all subjects. Characteristic lesions of
chronic active hepatitis in the biopsied specimens were confirmed in all. All
patients responded well to the IFN therapy and no patient was excluded from the
study. Fever observed a few days after the initiation of IFN therapy in several
subjects was tolerable.
SAECGs were recorded with a mean rejected count of 3 ± 2 beats. There
were significant increases in fQRS, and LAS40 (95.5 ± 8.5 to 99.6 ± 9.4 msec, P
< 0.0001, and 32.8 ± 3.1 to 36.3 ± 3.0 msec, P < 0.0001, respectively), whereas
RMS40 was significantly decreased (25.5 ± 5.4 to 22.3 ± 5.2 µV, P < 0.005) 1
month after starting IFN therapy in these subjects (n = 22). Ventricular LP was
negative in all subjects before IFN therapy but was positive in 7 of the 22 patients
after starting the therapy. As shown in the Figure, the positive LP was based on
the increased LAS40 and decreased RMS40 in these 7 patients. Therefore, the
subjects were divided into two groups depending on the appearance of LPs during
the therapy. Table I shows there were no statistical differences in the clinical base￾line characteristics or results of the noninvasive cardiac examinations between
the LP-positive (n = 7) and LP-negative (n = 15) groups.
Table II presents the sequential changes in mean heart rate, the three indices
of ventricular LP, and frequency of PVCs during the course of IFN therapy. The

1036 Int Heart J

mean heart rate in the LP-positive group evaluated by ambulatory ECG monitor￾ing was statistically the same as that in the LP-negative group throughout the
entire period of IFN therapy. However, it was significantly increased after start￾ing the treatment in both groups. With respect to the three SAECG indices related
to the ventricular LP, the fQRS showed no intergroup differences over the entire
treatment period. However, significant increases in the fQRS were observed after
starting the therapy, irrespective of the presence or absence of the ventricular LP.
The RMS40 exhibited a significant reduction during the therapy in the LP-posi￾A

tive group (P < 0.05), whereas it remained unchanged in the LP-negative group.
Significant prolongation of LAS40 was observed after starting the therapy in both
groups, and this prolongation was significantly greater in the LP-positive group
than in the LP-negative group (P < 0.001). Thus, LP was observed in 2 patients 1
week after and in another 5 patients 1 month after starting the therapy.
No sustained ventricular arrhythmias were documented by ambulatory ECG
in either group. The frequency of PVCs (beats per day) showed no individual
sequential changes and no intergroup differences (Table II). No cardiac events
were encountered in any patients in the mean follow-up period of 3.2 ± 0.7 (1.9 to
4.0) years.
SAECGs recorded after cessation of the IFN therapy showed negative ven￾tricular LPs for all subjects (n = 10), 4 of whom were in the LP-positive group.
DISCUSSION
This prospective but small-sampled study has demonstrated, for the first
time, IFN-induced ventricular LPs in patients with chronic active hepatitis.
Chronic hepatitis C virus infection sometimes causes cardiomyopathy9) which
may be reversed by IFN.10,11) However, this type of cardiomyopathy was unlikely
in the present patients because routine cardiac examinations conducted at the start
of the study indicated no organic heart diseases. Ventricular LPs reflect slow or
fragmented ventricular conduction, one of the major arrhythmogenic substrates,
predicting an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death
especially in patients with coronary artery disease. Because ambulatory monitor￾ing in this study did not document the appearance of sustained ventricular arrhyth￾mias during the course of the IFN therapy, SAECG findings may predict a
subclinical risk of arrhythmogenesis induced by IFN. Moreover, serial SAECGs
demonstrated that ventricular LPs that were present during IFN therapy disap￾peared after completion of the entire treatment. Based on these observations, it is
likely that the ventricular LPs observed in this study were due to the reversible
electrophysiological effects of IFN per se.
IFN exhibits versatile biological activities, and its subcellular signal trans￾duction mechanisms have been widely investigated.12) IFN indirectly activates
protein kinase C (PKC), which is mediated by cross-talk with the Jak-Stat path￾way.13) Recently, this hematopoietic pathway has been reported to be present in
cardiomyocytes as a signal transduction system for granulocyte colony-stimulat￾ing factor (G-CSF), a newly recognized cardioprotective cytokine.14) PKC modu￾lates various ion channels responsible for myocardial conduction, although this is
dependent on the different PKC isoforms.15) For instance, PKC activation inhibits
both cardiac Na and Ca channels by phosphorylating specific site(s) in certain

INTERFERON INDUCED LATE POTENTIALS 1039 Vol 46
No 6
domains of channel subunit(s).16,17) Furthermore, PKC degrades connexin43, a
major protein of myocardial gap junctions that plays an important role in cell-to￾cell coupling and communication.18) Correlation of connexin43 expression with
ventricular LPs has been reported recently in patients with nonischemic dilated
cardiomyopathy,19) leading to the speculation that PKC-induced degradation of
connexin43 will favor the development of ventricular LPs. In the multicellular
theoretical fiber based on the Luo-Rudy model, the L-type Ca channel but not the
Na channel contributes to the stable slow conduction under the condition of
impaired cell-to-cell coupling.20) Therefore, the dual suppression of Na and Ca
channels by PKC under the critical coupling condition may accelerate the ventric￾ular slow conduction and may underlie the LPs observed under IFN therapy.
IFN has been reported to cause sympathetic nerve activation,21) which was
suspected indirectly in this study due to the increase in mean heart rate observed
in ambulatory ECG monitoring after starting the IFN therapy (Table II). Sympa￾thetic activation also modulates the results of SAECG, and hence this possibility
should be taken into consideration when interpreting the results of this study.
Reportedly, sympathetic activation in addition to parasympathetic withdrawal
tends to mask the ventricular LP,22,23) whereas indices of SAECG related to the
ventricular LP (ie, fQRS, RMS40, and LAS40) are not usually corrected by the
instantaneous heart rate. Therefore, the results of this study may have been offset
in part by the altered autonomic nerve activity.
Study limitations: This study has demonstrated clinically IFN-induced ventricu￾lar LPs based on the insight obtained in our previous basic study.6) The aim of this
study included an analysis of the clinical traits leading to an IFN-induced ventric￾ular LP. However, this was not elucidated in the present study since the clinical
baseline characteristics demonstrated no significant differences between the LP￾positive and LP-negative groups (Table I). The many contributing factors affect￾ing SAECGs should be investigated using multivariate analysis applied to a large
number of patients. In other words, a future large-scale study is necessary to clar￾ify the role of ventricular LP in risk stratification of IFN-related cardiac events.
With respect to the ambulatory monitoring, heart rate variability analysis
may have clarified a possible role for IFN in the alteration of autonomic nerve
activities in more detail. However, heart rate variability over a period of more
than 5 months was not analyzed in this study. Because basal physical activity has
great influence on autonomic nervous tone, this activity during hospitalization is
obviously different from that in the outpatient clinic or during daily life at home.
Conclusion: This prospective study showed a reversible and subclinical risk of
IFN-induced arrhythmogenesis by combining SAECG with ambulatory monitor￾ing. However, to clarify the role of IFN-induced ventricular LP in the risk strati￾fication of cardiac events during IFN therapy, a large-scale study recruiting more

patients will be necessary.
