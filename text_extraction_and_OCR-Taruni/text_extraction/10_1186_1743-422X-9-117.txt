Abstract
Background: Immunosuppressive therapy protects the transplanted organ but predisposes the recipient to chronic
infections and malignancies. Transplant patients are at risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and cervical
cancer resulting from an impaired immune response in the case of primary infection or of reactivation of a latent
infection with human papillomavirus of high oncogenic potential (HR-HPV).
Methods: The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of HR-HPV cervical infections and CIN in 60 female
kidney graft recipients of reproductive age in comparison to that in healthy controls. Cervical swabs were analyzed
for the presence of HR-HPV DNA. HR-HPV-positive women remained under strict observation and were re-examined
after 24 months for the presence of transforming HR-HPV infection by testing for HR-HPV E6/E7 mRNA. All the
HR-HPV-positive patients were scheduled for further diagnostic tests including exfoliative cytology, colposcopy and
cervical biopsy.
Results: The prevalence of HR-HPV did not differ significantly between the study group and the healthy controls
(18% vs 25%, p = 0.37). There was no correlation between HR-HPV presence and the immunosuppresive regimen,
underlying disease, graft function or time interval from transplantation. A higher prevalence of HR-HPV was observed
in females who had had ≥2 sexual partners in the past. Among HR-HPV-positive patients, two cases of CIN2+ were
diagnosed in each group. In the course of follow-up, transforming HR-HPV infections were detected in two kidney
recipients and in one healthy female. Histologic examination confirmed another two cases of CIN2+ developing in
the cervical canal.
Conclusions: Female kidney graft recipients of reproductive age are as exposed to HR-HPV infection as are healthy
individuals. Tests detecting the presence of HR-HPV E6/E7 mRNA offer a novel diagnostic opportunity in those
patients, especially in those cases where lesions have developed in the cervical canal.

Background
Solid organ recipients receive immunosuppressive ther￾apy to protect the transplanted organ against rejection,
which therapy also unfortunately predisposes them to
chronic infections and the development of malignancies
[1]. According to the literature data renal transplant
recipients have a high risk of developing anogenital tract
malignancies [2,3]. Carcinoma of the uterine cervix
accounts for approximately 3% of all malignancies
among transplant patients [4]. Renal transplantation
increases the incidence of cervical intraepithelial neopla￾sia up to 14–16 fold, and that of invasive cervical cancer
3.0–8.6 fold [5-7]. The actual role of immunosuppres￾sive therapy in the development of malignancy remains
unclear. In the light of current data, it seems that im￾munosuppression, while not causing the progression of
the carcinoma itself, is mostly linked to the early
stages of dysplasia due to the mechanisms responsible

for the elimination of high-risk human papillomavirus
(HR-HPV) infection being defective [8]. At present
there are still no convincing and unanimous HPV screen￾ing data from renal transplant recipients. Positive
HR-HPV DNA tests are more sensitive than exfoliative cy￾tology in predicting females at risk of developing cervical
intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) or carcinoma of the cervix
[9]. However, HR-HPV DNA tests have poor diagnostic
specificity. This is due to the very high prevalence of tran￾sient HPV infections [10], as opposed to the persistent
HPV infections that lead to precancerous and cancerous
lesions of the uterine cervix. This is characterized by a
shift from a productive to a transforming infection result￾ing from a switch in viral gene expression. Increased ex￾pression of viral oncogenes E6 and E7 prevents the
infected cells from terminal differentiation by interfering
with cell-cycle regulating proteins p53 and Rb. This leads
to the HPV infection being maintained, because infected
cells do not undergo apoptosis, but on the contrary ex￾perience activation of their pro-proliferative genes
[11,12]. The specificity of cervical screening might
therefore be improved by the detection of biomarkers
distinctive of transforming infection. Obviously, HPV
DNA testing alone cannot discriminate between transi￾ent and transforming infections. However, the expression
of viral oncogenes E6 and E7 is regarded as a signal of
potential progression to invasive cervical cancer [12].
Therefore it was proposed that the detection of HPV E6
and E7 mRNAs could serve to identify patients with an
elevated risk of CIN and cervical cancer [13]. The study
was designed to investigate the prevalence of HR-HPV
DNA in cervical specimens, as well as the prevalence of
transforming HPV infection among HPV-positive
females, by detecting HPV E6 and E7 mRNAs. It also
aimed to assess the clinical value of these tests in the
cervical screening of kidney graft recipients in compari￾son to that of healthy women.
Results
HR-HPV infection was diagnosed in 11/60 kidney graft
recipients and 15/60 healthy women, indicating a compar￾able infection rate (p = 0.37) in the two groups. HR-HPV
was detected significantly more often in females having
had >2 sexual partners in the past. There was, however,
no correlation observed between the presence of HPV in
kidney graft recipients and serum creatinine concentra￾tion, age, body mass index (BMI), immunosuppressive
therapy regimen and underlying or coexisting diseases.
On initial screening, among the HR-HPV DNA￾positive women abnormal Pap smear results were
detected in two kidney graft recipients (2 cases of HSIL)
and two healthy women (LSIL and HSIL). After
colposcopy-guided cervical biopsy, in all cases CIN2+
was diagnosed and the patients were scheduled for
further treatment. Three of them were offered loop elec￾trosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) and histological
examination confirmed that the lesions were excised
with negative margins. In one case (a transplant patient)
extirpation of the uterus was offered because of con￾comitant uterine fibroids accompanied by excessive
menstrual bleeding, leading to severe anemia that was
resistant to hormonal therapy.
On follow-up after twenty four months, it was estab￾lished that the rate of clearance of HR-HPV infection of
the uterine cervix was similar in both groups, reaching
81,8% in the study group. In the control group, all
women but one (93%) were HR-HPV negative at the
time of follow-up (p = ns).
Among renal transplant recipients, a persistent infec￾tion with HR-HPV was confirmed in two cases. Both
women had a positive E6/E7 mRNA test and were sched￾uled for additional investigations. After colposcopy￾guided cervical biopsy, CIN3 was diagnosed in one case
and the patient was scheduled for further treatment
(LEEP excision procedure). The histological evaluation
of specimens from the cervical canal confirmed the
previous diagnosis of CIN3. Significantly, this patient
displayed a normal cervical cytology, even though the
pathologist had been informed about the presence of
HPV E6/E7 mRNA. The other transplant patient had a
normal Pap smear and innocuous colposcopy finding,
but nevertheless qualified for cervical biopsy and canal
curettage. Histological examination revealed no patho￾logical lesions in collected tissue samples.
Similarly, HPV E6/E7 mRNA-positive females from
the control group underwent additional examinations.
Repeated Pap smear results revealed HSIL. Colposcopy
and subsequent biopsies led to the diagnosis of CIN3 in
tissues obtained during cervical canal curettage. This pa￾tient was offered LEEP and histological examination
confirmed that CIN3 in the cervical canal had been
excised with negative margins.
Discussion
There are relatively few publications dealing with HR￾HPV infection in populations of transplant recipients.
The incidence of HR-HPV infection as well as abnormal
Pap smear results is reported to be quite high in recipi￾ents, reaching 59% according to some studies [14-16]).
However, other data suggest a low prevalence of HPV
infections in kidney graft recipients, similar to that of
the general population [17]. In our study the preva￾lence of HR-HPV infections in both groups was similar,
with the prevalence in immunocompromised women
tending to be slightly lower than that in healthy con￾trols (18,6% vs 25%, p = ns). A recently published Italian
study by Origoni et al suggested that transplant recipi￾ents receiving long-term immunosuppression may not be
Pietrzak et al. Virology Journal 2012, 9:117 Page 2 of 5
http://www.virologyj.com/content/9/1/117

more at risk of HPV infection and CIN than healthy con￾trols [18], which is in agreement with our results. How￾ever, the mean recipient age in the above mentioned
Italian study approached 38 years, and in our study
37 years, whereas it is well established that younger
women are especially prone to HPV infection [19].
Morrison et al suggested that HR-HPV infection was rela￾tively rarely encountered among older renal graft recipi￾ents with normal Pap smear results. This applied in
particular to monogamous or sexually inactive patients.
Therefore it was recommended that education about
avoiding high-risk sexual relations should be of prime im￾portance among kidney graft recipients [17]. Our results
support the above mentioned recommendation. During
the analysis of the correlation between HR-HPV infection
and the number of lifetime sexual partners, it was noted
that the incidence of HPV was slightly higher among
patients from both groups that had had more than one
sexual partner in their lifetime; the difference was however
statistically insignificant. The kidney recipients also had a
significantly higher incidence of having had only one life￾time sexual partner, which may explain the relatively low
incidence of cervical HPV infection in our cohort.
Testing for E6/E7 mRNA offers a novel approach in
cervical screening. There are published reports pointing
out that the introduction of E6/E7 HPV mRNA testing
may improve the diagnostic accuracy in HR-HPV￾positive women [20]. Benevolo et al observed that, in
a group of 408 HR-HPV-positive patients with normal
Pap smears (regarded as ≤ HSIL), positive HPV mRNA
results were significantly more often associated with
CIN ≥ 2 than with CIN ≤ 2 lesions. Therefore the authors
concluded that testing for E6/E7 HPV mRNA may have
a diagnostic and potentially prognostic role in the man￾agement of HR-HPV(+), HSIL(−) patients [21].
There is strong evidence that testing for HPV E6/E7
mRNA is more specific than testing for HPV DNA, but
the sensitivity of the test may be unsatisfactory for clin￾ical purposes. Benevolo et al conducted another study
on a group of 1201 participants and concluded that E6/
E7 mRNA testing was more efficient than cytology for
the triage of HPV DNA-positive women. However, the
sensitivity for CIN2+ was relatively low (83% in cases of
ASCUS, LSIL 62% and HSIL 67%). That fact means that
HPV DNA-positive women, in spite of the negative E6/
E7 mRNA test result, would nevertheless require strict
follow-up [22]. In our study all the HR-HPV-positive
patients, except for three females with transforming
infections confirmed by means of the E6/E7 mRNA test,
cleared the cervical infection within 24 months of
follow-up.
Norwegian authors [23] have raised the issue of speci￾ficity of the test, around 30% of their patients having a
positive HPV E6/E7 mRNA test result with no lesions
being detected by subsequent cervical biopsy. The posi￾tive predictive value of HPV E6/E7 mRNA testing in
HR-HPV-positive women with minor cervical lesions
seen on cytological examination reached 70%. In our
study, one of the three HPV E6/E7 mRNA-positive
patients—a kidney recipient—had no abnormal tissues
detectable in specimens collected during colposcopic￾guided cervical biopsy and canal curettage. The explan￾ation proposed by the Norwegian authors is based on
the fact that colposcopic biopsy may miss as much as
26-42% of the CIN2+ lesions. Infections with HPV type
18 or 45 with typical localization inside the cervical
canal may especially be missed on colposcopy. In fact,
the Norwegian authors suggest that the 30% of the
mRNA-positive patients with a negative histological con￾firmation of cervical disease may represent false negative
results. Our patient was not scheduled for conization
but remains under strict clinical follow-up and will be
scheduled for repeat colposcopy and biopsy in 6 months’
time.
Conclusions
The clinical value of HPV E6/E7 mRNA testing as well
as its future position in cervical screening algorithms
remains to be established. The possibility of confirming
a transforming HPV infection, thereby facilitating the
early identification of women at greatest risk of cervical
neoplasm development, seems very promising. This ap￾plies especially to immunocompromised renal graft reci￾pients, that in the past were often regarded as a high
risk group, although the currently published data are in￾consistent. Origoni et al found no increase of CIN in
population of Italian female renal graft recipients that
remained under long-term follow-up [18]. On the other
hand a recently published report by Meeuwis et al ana￾lyzing data from over 1000 female kidney graft recipients
confirmed the fivefold increase of risk of cervical cancer
in comparison to the general population and emphasized
the importance of cervical screening [24]. According to
our data, female kidney graft recipients of reproductive
age are as exposed to HR-HPV infection as are healthy
individuals, which may be regarded as novelty. Our
results, despite the small number of HR-HPV-positive
females that underwent follow-up, highlight the utility of
HPV E6/E7 mRNA detection in those cases where
lesions develop in the cervical canal, which often go un￾detected by exfoliative cytology. Timely detection of cer￾vical dysplasia at the early stages would allow for timely
and adequate therapy among these patients. The de￾crease of cervical cancer morbidity may be achieved in
future by means of HPV vaccination, but at present
there are insufficient data regarding the efficacy and
safety of the available vaccines in populations of iatro￾genically immunocompromised females.

Methods
One hundred twenty women of reproductive age, in out￾patient care at the First Department of Obstetrics and
Gynecology, Medical University of Warsaw, between 1st
October 2007 and 30th September 2008, were evaluated
for the study. The study group included 60 kidney graft
recipients with normal cervical smears obtained within
the previous 12 months. The time interval that had
elapsed since the kidney transplantation varied from
7 months to 20 years, with the mean interval being
6.4 ± 4.9 years. Over 76% of the kidney graft recipients
(46/60) had undergone transplantation less than 10 years
previously. The majority of graft recipients (34/60) were
on a regimen of three drugs, consisting mainly of calci￾neurin inhibitors with corticosteroids and mycophenolan
acid precursors. An immunosuppressive regimen of two
drugs was prescribed to 24/60 women. The control
group consisted of 60 healthy women under routine
gynecological care in the outpatient clinic of our Depart￾ment. The characteristics of both groups are presented
in Table 1, and the selection criteria in Table 2.
The cervical swabs were analyzed using the Amplicor
HPV Roche Molecular Systems test designed to detect
the DNA of thirteen high risk HPV types: 16, 18, 31, 33,
39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59 and 68. All the participants gave
informed consent for enrollment in the study which had
been approved by the Bioethical Committee of the Med￾ical University of Warsaw.
After the initial cervical screening described above, a
cohort consisting of 15 healthy women and 11 renal
transplant recipients showed the presence of HR-HPV
DNA in their cervical samples. As follow-up, these
patients underwent further investigations. Prompt cer￾vical smears according to the Bethesda/Papanicolau
system, as well as colposcopy, were performed in order
to plan further treatment if necessary.
The HR-HPV DNA-positive females remained under
close observation and cervical swabs were obtained
again after 24 months. These were analyzed for the pres￾ence of HR-HPV E6/E7 mRNA using the CE-IVD- certi￾fied Nucli-Sense EasyQ test (Biomerieux, France), which
detected the mRNA of HR-HPV types 16, 18, 31, 33 and
45. All the patients with positive HR-HPV E6/E7 mRNA
test results were subjected to further investigations.
All the samples obtained from HPV DNA-positive
females after 24 months of follow-up were also analyzed
using the CE-IVD-certified Linear Array Genotyping
Test (Roche, Switzerland) which detected of DNA of 37
