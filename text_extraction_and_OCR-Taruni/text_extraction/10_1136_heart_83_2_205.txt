Abstract
BACKGROUND Endothelial dysfunction plays an important role in
the development of atherosclerotic vascular disease, which is the
leading cause of mortality in patients with chronic renal failure.
OBJECTIVE To examine the relation between predialysis renal
failure and endothelial function.
DESIGN Two groups were studied: 80 patients with non-diabetic
chronic renal failure and 26 healthy controls, with similar age and
sex distributions. Two indices of endothelial function were assessed:
high resolution ultrasonography to measure flow mediated
endothelium dependent dilatation of the brachial artery following
reactive hyperaemia, and plasma concentration of von Willebrand
factor. Endothelium independent dilatation was also assessed
following sublingual glyceryl trinitrate. The patients were divided
into those with and without overt atherosclerotic vascular disease.
RESULTS Although patients with chronic renal failure had
significantly impaired endothelium dependent dilatation compared
with controls (median (interquartile range), 2.6% (0.7% to 4.8%)v
6.5% (4.8% to 8.3%); p < 0.001) and increased von Willebrand
factor (254 (207 to 294)v 106 (87 to 138) iu/dl; p < 0.001), there
was no difference between renal failure patients with and without
atherosclerotic vascular disease. Within the chronic renal failure
group, endothelium dependent dilatation and von Willebrand factor
were similar in patients in the upper and lower quartiles of
glomerular filtration rate (2.7% (0.7% to 6.7%) v2.8% (1.1% to
5.0%); and 255 (205 to 291) v254 (209 to 292) iu/dl, respectively).
Endothelium independent dilatation did not differ between the
renal failure or control groups and was also similar in patients with
renal failure irrespective of the degree of renal failure or the
presence of atherosclerotic vascular disease.
CONCLUSIONS Endothelial function is abnormal in chronic renal
failure, even in patients with mild renal insufficiency and those
without atherosclerotic vascular disease, suggesting that uraemia
may directly promote the development of atherosclerosis early in


the progression of chronic renal failure.
