Abstract
Objective The purpose of this study was to analyze the CT findings of interstitial lung diseases that are as￾sociated with collagen vascular disease (CVD), with particular attention to nonspecific interstitial pneumonia
(NSIP), and to examine whether it is possible to predict the clinical diagnosis of CVDs based on the CT
findings alone.
Methods CT scans of 49 patients with NSIP associated with CVD (15 males, 34 females; mean age, 55±10
years; age range, 25-76 years) were included in this retrospective study. All patients underwent a surgical bi￾opsy. The clinical diagnosis comprised rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (n=15), systemic sclerosis (SSc) (n=8),
polymyositis and dermatomyositis (PM/DM) (n=18), Sjögren’s syndrome (SjS) (n=4), and mixed connective
tissue disease (MCTD) (n=4). Each CT was reviewed by two independent observers who made a clinical di￾agnosis based on the CT findings alone.
Results The observers made a correct diagnosis for 22 (45%) of the 49 patients. A correct diagnosis was
made for: RA in 7 (47%) of 15 patients; SSc in 3 (38%) of 8 patients; PM/DM in 11 (61%) of 18 patients;
SjS in 1 (25%) of 4 patients. None of the 4 MCTD cases was diagnosed.
Conclusion It is difficult to make a correct clinical diagnosis of the various types of CVDs based solely on
CT findings. However, it is probable to make a reasonably accurate clinical diagnosis in cases that show the
typical CT findings, especially for PM/DM patients.

Introduction
Collagen vascular diseases (CVDs) constitute a group of
autoimmune disorders that can involve the respiratory sys￾tem and cause focal or diffuse pulmonary disease. CVDs
that show radiologic features of interstitial lung disease in￾clude rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythemato￾sus (SLE), systemic sclerosis (SSc), polymyositis and der￾matomyositis (PM/DM), Sjögren’s syndrome (SjS), and
mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD). The American
Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society defined
the following seven distinct types of idiopathic interstitial
pneumonia (IIP): idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) or

usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), nonspecific interstitial
pneumonia (NSIP), cryptogenic organizing pneumonia
(COP) or bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia
( BOOP ) , acute interstitial pneumonia, respiratory
bronchiolitis-associated interstitial lung disease (RB-ILD),
desquamative interstitial pneumonia (DIP), and lymphoid in￾terstitial pneumonia (LIP) (1). At pathologic examination,
interstitial lung diseases associated with CVD are diverse
and include UIP, NSIP, COP (or BOOP), diffuse alveolar
damage (DAD), and LIP (2).
Computed tomography (CT) is the most widely available,
important, and standardized modality for the evaluation of
interstitial lung diseases. The abnormal CT findings seen
with IIPs and interstitial lung diseases associated with CVD
have been extensively investigated.
Pathologic findings from patients with rheumatoid lung
disease have revealed five different groups based on the
specimens obtained at open lung biopsy: pulmonary rheuma￾toid nodules, UIP, BOOP, lymphoid hyperplasia, and NSIP
(3). The CT findings reported in patients who have RA in￾clude bronchiectasis, bronchiolitis obliterans (i.e., air￾trapping, mosaic perfusion), pleural effusions or pleural
thickening, and enlarged lymph nodes (4).
Interstitial lung diseases associated with SLE are uncom￾mon; in one series of 120 patients, only five (4%) had find￾ings of interstitial lung diseases (5). The CT findings of in￾terstitial fibrosis with SSc are similar to those of idiopathic
NSIP and less extensive, less coarse, and characterized by a
greater proportion of ground-glass attenuation than seen in
patients with IPF (6). The types of interstitial lung diseases
associated with PM/DM were identified, as follows, based
on pathologic patterns: NSIP, UIP or BOOP, and DAD (7).
A relatively high prevalence of consolidation (52%) and a
low prevalence of honeycombing (16%) which is lower than
in patients with SSc (8), were observed on high-resolution
CT (HRCT) findings (9).
The common CT findings in SjS consisted of bronchiecta￾sis and poorly defined centrilobular nodular or branching
linear opacities, areas with ground-glass attenuation, and
honeycombing (10). LIP frequently occurs in association
with SjS, a characteristic pattern of extensive areas with
ground-glass attenuation with scattered thin-walled cysts is
seen in approximately 50% of LIP patients (11). The pre￾dominant abnormalities in MCTD included ground-glass at￾tenuation, subpleural micronodules, and nonseptal linear
opacities (12). The frequency of honeycombing in MCTD
was lower than in SSc and higher than in PM/DM (8).
The most common type of interstitial lung disease associ￾ated with CVD is NSIP (2), followed by UIP (2). The pur￾pose of this study was to analyze the CT findings of inter￾stitial lung diseases associated with CVD, with particular at￾tention to NSIP, and to examine whether it is possible to de￾termine the clinical diagnosis of CVDs based on the CT
findings alone, with particular attention to the five common
CVDs, namely RA, SSc, PM/DM, SjS, and MCTD.
Methods
Study population
CT scans of 66 patients with interstitial lung diseases as￾sociated with CVD, taken between January 1995 and De￾cember 2006 at four institutions, were collected for this ret￾rospective study. Ultimately, 49 patients with NSIP associ￾ated with CVD were enrolled. Demographic data of patients
with NSIP associated with CVD are summarized in Table 1.
The patients included 15 males and 34 females, aged 55±10
years (mean ± SD) (range: 25-76 years). The institutional
review board gave full approval and waived informed con￾sent for this retrospective study.
All patients underwent open lung biopsy or video-assisted
thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and all interstitial lung dis￾eases were histologically proved at each participating institu￾tion. Biopsy specimens were obtained from 2 to 3 different
lobes in each patient. The diagnosis of interstitial lung dis￾ease was based on the current histologic criteria for the di￾agnosis of the relevant disease by at least two experienced
chest pathologists (with more than 15 years experience) (1).
The clinical findings of all cases, including those from the
CT, were subsequently reviewed by chest physicians. Thus,
patients with infectious diseases or other types of interstitial
pneumonia associated with pneumoconiosis, eosinophilic
lung diseases or hypersensitivity pneumonitis were excluded.
The pathological diagnoses of interstitial lung disease com￾prised UIP (n=12), NSIP (n=49), OP (n=1), DAD (n=2),
and LIP (n=2). The clinical diagnoses of CVD with NSIP
comprised RA (n=15), SSc (n=8), PM/DM (n=18), SjS (n=
4), and MCTD (n=4). All four patients with SjS had pri￾mary Sjögren’s syndrome.

Thin-section CT techniques
Sequential CT scans were obtained using a variety of
scanners. All CT scans were performed at the end of inspi￾ration with the patient in the supine position, and no intrave￾nous contrast material was used. Each patient had a single
chest CT examination. The CT scans consisted of 1- to 2-
mm collimation sections reconstructed using a high-spatial￾frequency algorithm. Images were photographed at window
settings appropriate for viewing both the lung (window level
from -600 to -800 HU; window width from 1,200 to 2,000
HU) and the mediastinal (window level from 20 to 80 HU;
window width from 300 to 400 HU) windows. The proto￾cols consisted of thin-sections obtained at 1-cm intervals (40
patients), 2-cm intervals (7 patients), or 3-cm intervals (2
patients).
Evaluation of thin-section CT findings
The CT scans were randomized and then retrospectively
reviewed by two independent chest radiologists (O.H., H.S.).
The observers knew that they were all NSIP cases associ￾ated with CVD; they were also aware of the patient’s age
and gender, but were unaware of any other clinical findings.
The CT scans were assessed for the presence and extent of
areas with ground-glass attenuation, areas of air-space con￾solidation, honeycombing, cysts, intralobular reticular opac￾ity, nonseptal linear or platelike opacity, subpleural lines,
thickening of bronchovascular bundles, interlobular septal
thickening, centrilobular nodules, traction bronchiectasis,
pleural thickening, pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, and
lymph node enlargement.
Ground-glass attenuation was defined as hazy increased
attenuation of the lung that did not obscure the underlying
vessels (13, 14). Air-space consolidation was defined as a
homogeneous increase in pulmonary parenchymal attenu￾ation that obscured the underlying vessels (13, 14). Honey￾combing was considered present when clustered cystic air￾spaces that ranged in size from 2 mm to 1 cm with well￾defined thick walls were seen in the subpleural regions (13,
14). Cysts were defined as round airspaces with a well￾defined wall (13, 14). Intralobular reticular opacity was con￾sidered present when interlacing line shadows were sepa￾rated by a few millimeters (13, 14). Nonseptal linear or
platelike opacity was defined as an elongated line of soft￾tissue attenuation that was distinct from interlobular septa
and bronchovascular bundles (13, 14). Subpleural lines were
defined as a curvilinear opacity a few millimeters or less in
thickness, less than 1 cm from the pleural surface and paral￾leling pleura (13, 14). Thickening of bronchovascular bun￾dles was defined as an increase in bronchial wall thickness
and an increase in the diameter of pulmonary artery
branches caused by thickened peribronchovascular intersti￾tium (13). Interlobular septal thickening was defined as ab￾normal widening of interlobular septa (13, 14). A nodule
was defined as a focal, rounded opacity of less than 3 cm in
diameter, which could be either well or poorly defined.
When a nodule was located in the center of the lobule or
lobular core, it was defined as a centrilobular nodule (13).
Traction bronchiectasis was defined as irregular bronchial
dilatation within or around areas with a parenchymal abnor￾mality. Architectural distortion was considered present when
bronchi, pulmonary vessels, or interlobar fissures or septa
were abnormally displaced (14). Lymph nodes were consid￾ered to be enlarged if their short-axis diameter on CT ex￾ceeded 10 mm.
The lungs were divided into six zones (upper, middle, and
lower zones in both lungs), and each zone was evaluated
separately. The upper zone was defined as the part of the
lung above the level of the tracheal carina; the lower zone,
as the part of the lung below the level of the inferior pulmo￾nary vein; and the middle zone, as the portion of the lung
between the upper and lower zones. Each CT finding was
assessed and considered present, and the extent of involve￾ment of the findings was evaluated visually and independ￾ently for each lung zone. A score was assigned on the basis
of the percentage of lung parenchyma that showed evidence
of an abnormality and was estimated to the nearest 10% of
parenchymal involvement. The overall percentage of in￾volvement was calculated by averaging the scores of the six
lung zones.
The extent of traction bronchiectasis was evaluated by
counting the number of segments that showed evidence of
traction bronchiectasis. The following 18 segments or sub￾segments were evaluated: right apical upper, right anterior
upper, right posterior upper, right lateral middle, right me￾dial middle, right superior upper, right medial basal, right
anterior basal, right lateral basal, right posterior basal, left
apicoposterior upper, left anterior upper, left superior lingu￾lar, left inferior lingular, left superior lower, left anterome￾dial basal, left lateral basal, and left posterior basal. The ex￾tent of traction bronchiectasis was also quantified by assess￾ing the generations of the most proximal bronchial branches
involved. Traction bronchiectasis was scored as follows: 0,
no bronchial dilatation; 1, bronchial dilatation involving
bronchi distal to the fourth-generation bronchi; 2, bronchial
dilatation involving from the second- and third-generation
bronchi; 3, bronchial dilatation involving the trachea and/or
the main bronchus.
After assessing the presence and extent of findings, the
observers evaluated their predominant distribution. Zonal
predominance was assessed as being upper or lower. Upper
lung zone predominance was present when most of the ab￾normalities were above the level of the tracheal carina; and
lower zone predominance was present when most of the ab￾normalities were below this level. The anatomic distribution
was noted to be central if the abnormalities were primarily
located in the inner third of the lung, and peripheral if the
abnormalities were primarily present in the outer third of the
lung. Peribronchovascular predominance was defined as
findings located mainly around the bronchus and artery.
After reviewing the thin-section CT findings, the observ￾ers recorded the clinical diagnosis of CVDs, as suggested by

the CT findings according to previously published data of
each interstitial lung diseases associated with CVD (Ta￾ble 2). Differential diagnosis was limited to the five types
(RA, SSc, PM/DM, SjS, and MCTD).
Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using statistical
software (SPSS, version 12.0J; SPSS, Tokyo, Japan). The
inter-observer variation for the extent of various abnormali￾ties was analyzed using the Bland-Altman plot. The inter￾observer variation for the clinical diagnosis of CVDs based
on CT findings was analyzed with the κ statistic. Inter￾observer agreement was classified as poor (κ=0.00-0.20),
fair (κ=0.21-0.40), moderate (κ=0.41-0.60), good (κ=0.61-
0.80), or excellent (κ=0.81-1.00). Statistical significance was
defined as p<0.05.
The readings of the two observers pertaining to the extent
of various abnormal findings were combined by calculating
the average. Disagreement regarding the existence of pleural
thickening, pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, lymph
node enlargement, the anatomic distribution, the zonal pre￾dominance, and the clinical diagnosis of CVDs based on the
CT findings was resolved by the consensus of the two ob￾servers.
The Kruskal-Wallis H-test was used to evaluate differ￾ences in the demographic data of patients, the extent of vari￾ous abnormalities, pleural thickening, pleural effusion, peri￾cardial effusion, lymph node enlargement, the anatomic dis￾tribution, and the zonal predominance between each NSIP
associated with CVD. A post-hoc test (Tukey’s HSD proce￾dure) was used to evaluate differences between each set of
two groups.
Results
Observer agreement
Inter-observer agreement for the clinical diagnosis of
CVDs based on CT findings was fair (κ=0.28).
The result of the Bland-Altman plot between the two ob￾servers is shown in Fig. 1. The x-axis of this graph is the
average of two results for the extent of various abnormali￾ties. The y-axis represents the difference between two results
for the extent of various abnormalities. This assay indicates
the inter-observer agreement of the extent of various abnor￾malities, if each plot existed within the bound of the average
±2 × SD of difference of two results. The SD was 2.6 (2
SD=5.2), and the average was 0.3 (%) (Fig. 1).
Diagnosis
The observers made a correct diagnosis for 22 (45%) of
the 49 patients, as summarized in Table 3. A correct diagno￾sis of RA was made for 7 (47%) of 15 patients (Figs. 2-4);
of the 8 RA cases misdiagnosed by the observer, 3 were in￾correctly recorded as SSc and 5 as PM/DM. A correct diag￾nosis of SSc was made for 3 (38%) of 8 patients
(Figs. 5-7); of the 5 misdiagnosed SSc cases, the observer
recorded 4 as RA and 1 as PM/DM. A correct diagnosis of
PM/DM was made for 11 (61%) of 18 patients (Figs. 8, 9);
of the 7 misdiagnosed PM/DM cases, the observer recorded
5 as RA and 2 as SSc. A correct diagnosis of SjS was made

differences were not significant (p=0.369). Areas of air￾space consolidation were found in all types of CVDs with
similar extent, except for MCTD in which this finding
showed the lowest extent. Honeycombing was present in
four types of CVDs, except for SjS. The extent of honey￾combing in MCTD was significantly greater than those in
SSc (p=0.050). The extent of honeycombing in SSc was less
than in RA and PM/DM, but there were no significant dif￾ferences (p=0.853, 0.895). Cysts were present in PM/DM,
SjS, and MCTD with similar extent. Intralobular reticular
opacity was present in all types of CVDs. The extent of in￾tralobular reticular opacity in SSc was significantly greater
than in RA (p=0.007) and PM/DM (p=0.029) (Fig. 5). Non￾septal linear or platelike opacity was present in all types of
CVDs, but with no significant differences (p=0.701). Sub￾pleural lines were found in all types. The extent of subpleu￾ral lines in PM/DM was significantly greater than those in
RA (p=0.024) and SSc (p=0.017) (Fig. 8). The extent of
subpleural lines in MCTD was also greater than others, but
there were no significant differences (Fig. 11). Interlobular

septal thickening was found in all types. The extent of inter￾lobular septal thickening in SjS was significantly greater
than in RA (p=0.050). Centrilobular nodules were present in
RA, SSc, and PM/DM, and showed a greater extent in RA
(Fig. 2), although the differences were not significant. Trac￾tion bronchiectasis was present in all types, but with no sig￾nificant difference.
Pleural thickening and lymph node enlargement were pre￾sent in all types, and the differences were not significant.
Pleural effusion was present in SSc, PM/DM, and SjS, with
no significant differences. Pericardial effusion was absent in
all types (Table 4).
The incidence of patients with RA and SjS with a lower
zonal predominance was less than for the other 3 types (p=
0.001) (Table 4). There were no significant differences in
anatomic distribution among patients with NSIP associated
with CVD.
Discussion
The observers made a correct diagnosis for 22 (45%) of
the 49 patients. A correct diagnosis was made for: RA in 7
(47%) of 15 patients; SSc in 3 (38%) of 8 patients; PM/DM
in 11 (61%) of 18 patients; and SjS in 1 (25%) of 4 pa￾tients. None of the 4 MCTD cases was diagnosed based on
CT findings alone.
The types of interstitial lung diseases associated with PM/
DM were identified on the basis of pathologic patterns:
NSIP, UIP or BOOP, and DAD (7). The frequency of hon￾eycombing was 16% of patients who had abnormal HRCT
findings (9), which is lower than in patients with SSc (8). In
the present study, the extent of honeycombing in patients
with NSIP with PM/DM was not significantly different from
each other (Table 4). The extent of intralobular reticular
opacity was less than in patients with NSIP with SSc, while
it was also almost the same as in patients with NSIP with
RA (Table 4). Nonseptal linear or plate-like opacity has
been reported as one of the most common CT findings in
interstitial lung diseases associated with PM/DM (9, 15). In
the present study, in patients with NSIP with PM/DM, non￾septal linear or plate-like opacity was present in 7 (39%) of
18 patients (Fig. 9).
Subpleural lines were defined as a curvilinear opacity,
which was also termed a subpleural curvilinear shadow, a
few millimeters or less in thickness, less than 1 cm from the
pleural surface and paralleling pleura (13, 14). It was first
described in patients with asbestosis. This occurs as a result
of atelectasis, fibrosis, or inflammation, and can be seen in a
variety of lung diseases including IPF or UIP (16), as well
as in normal patients as a result of atelectasis. Schurawitzki
et al reported that 17 (74%) of 23 patients with SSc showed
subpleural lines on HRCT (17). Mino et al reported that 7
(38%) of 19 patients with PM/DM showed subpleural lines
on HRCT (18). In the present study, subpleural lines were
present in: 12 (67%) of 18 NSIP cases with PM/DM; 4
(27%) of 15 NSIP cases with RA; 2 (15%) of 8 NSIP cases
with SSc; 1 (25%) of 4 NSIP cases with SjS; and 2 (50%)
of 4 NSIP cases with MCTD. Subpleural lines were there￾fore most commonly found in patients with NSIP with PM/
DM (Fig. 8). This information may be useful in the diagno￾sis of interstitial lung diseases associated with PM/DM.
Pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities are more common
and more severe in SSc than in the other types of CVD. The
pathologic features are of NSIP or UIP, the former being
more common (7). The CT findings of interstitial fibrosis
with SSc are similar to those of idiopathic NSIP and less
extensive, less coarse, and characterized by a greater propor￾tion of ground-glass attenuation than seen in patients with
IPF (6). In the present study, in NSIP patients with SSc, the
extent of intralobular reticular opacity was significantly
greater than those in RA (p=0.007) and PM/DM (p=0.029)
(Table 4). The abnormalities showed lower lung zone and
posterior predominance, which is the same as in a previous
report (6) (Figs. 5, 6). This might be useful information for

identifying interstitial lung diseases associated with SSc.
However, there were some SSc cases with combined centri￾lobular nodules that the observers incorrectly recorded as
RA (Fig. 7). It is difficult to clearly distinguish the clinical
diagnosis of SSc from the other types based solely on CT
findings.
In NSIP patients with RA, the extent of honeycombing
was not significantly different from each other (Table 4).
The extent of intralobular reticular opacity in RA was sig￾nificantly less than those in SSc (p=0.007). The extent of
centrilobular nodules in RA was not significantly different
from each other (Table 4). In the present study, pleural effu￾sion was not present in patients with NSIP with RA. Pleural
thickening was present in 3 (20%) of 15 RA patients with
NSIP. Lymph node enlargement was present in 4 patients
(27%). Patterns of CT findings from NSIP cases with RA
were diverse (Figs. 2-4) and there were no characteristic CT
findings of NSIP with RA to allow differentiation from the
other 4 types with NSIP.
Sjögren’s syndrome can occur as a primary disease, with￾out features of other CVD, or as a secondary disease in as￾sociation with other CVDs, most commonly RA. LIP fre￾quently occurs in association with SjS, followed in fre￾quency by airway abnormalities such as follicular bronchitis,
bronchiectasis, and bronchiolitis (7). A characteristic pattern
of extensive areas with ground-glass attenuation with scat￾tered thin-walled cysts is seen in approximately 50% of pa￾tients with LIP (19). Poorly defined centrilobular nodules
and thickening of the bronchovascular bundles, also seen in
LIP, represent expansion of the interstitial tissue by lym￾phoplasma cell infiltration (19). In the present study, cysts
were seen in NSIP patients with SjS, but the extent of cysts
was not significantly different from each other (Table 4).
Honeycombing, thickening of bronchovascular bundles and
centrilobular nodules were not seen in NSIP patients with
SjS (Table 4).
Based on the findings of this study and previous reports
(8, 12), CT findings of NSIP associated with MCTD resem￾ble NSIP with PM/DM (Fig. 11). Saito et al (8) also con￾cluded that CT findings in MCTD were a combination of
those seen in other patients (SLE, SSc, and PM/DM). In the
present study, 4 MCTD cases were recorded incorrectly as
RA (n=2), SSc (n=1), and PM/DM (n=1). Indeed, it is diffi￾cult to define the clinical diagnosis of MCTD based on the
CT findings alone.
The present study has several limitations. First, the num￾ber of patients with NSIP associated with SjS and MCTD
was relatively small. Second, patients with interstitial lung
diseases associated with SLE were not included. Interstitial
lung diseases associated with SLE are rare, and this limita￾tion must be reflected in clinical practice. Third, this was a
retrospective study and thus a prospective study is required
to confirm the results. Finally, the CT images used in this
study were obtained using different CT scanners and proto-

cols, and thus the details of each finding could be evaluated
only to a limited degree.
In conclusion, generally speaking, it is difficult to arrive
at a correct clinical diagnosis of CVDs based on CT find￾ings alone. However, it is probable to make a reasonably ac￾curate clinical diagnosis in cases that show the typical CT
findings, especially for PM/DM patients. Using the detailed
findings on HRCT, a feasible method to predict the diagno￾sis of NSIP-associated CVD.
