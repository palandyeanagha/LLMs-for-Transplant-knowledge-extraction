Abstract
Introduction: Dialysis-requiring acute kidney injury (D-AKI) is common among intensive care unit (ICU) patients.
However, follow-up data on the risk of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) among these patients remain sparse. We
assessed the short-term and long-term risk of ESRD after D-AKI, compared it with the risk in other ICU patients, and
examined the risk within subgroups of ICU patients.
Methods: We used population-based medical registries to identify all adult patients admitted to an ICU in
Denmark from 2005 through 2010, who survived for 90 days after ICU admission. D-AKI was defined as needing
acute dialysis at or after ICU admission. Subsequent ESRD was defined as a need for chronic dialysis for more than
90 days or a kidney transplant. We computed the cumulative ESRD risk for patients with D-AKI and for other ICU
patients, taking into account death as a competing risk, and computed hazard ratios (HRs) using a Cox model
adjusted for potential confounders.
Results: We identified 107,937 patients who survived for 90 days after ICU admission. Of these, 3,062 (2.8%) had an
episode of D-AKI following ICU admission. The subsequent risk of ESRD up to 180 days after ICU admission was 8.5% for
patients with D-AKI, compared with 0.1% for other ICU patients. This corresponds to an adjusted HR of 105.6 (95%
confidence interval (CI): 78.1 to 142.9). Among patients who survived 180 days after ICU admission without developing
ESRD (n = 103,996), the 181-day to 5-year ESRD risk was 3.8% for patients with D-AKI, compared with 0.3% for other ICU
patients, corresponding to an adjusted HR of 6.2 (95% CI: 4.7 to 8.1). During the latter period, the impact of AKI was
most pronounced in the youngest patients, aged 15 to 49 years (adjusted HR = 12.8, 95% CI: 6.5 to 25.4) and among
patients without preexisting chronic kidney disease (adjusted HR = 11.9, 95% CI: 8.5 to 16.8).
Conclusion: D-AKI is an important risk factor for ESRD for up to five years after ICU admission.

Introduction
Acute kidney injury is a common organ dysfunction that
may lead to or complicate intensive care unit (ICU) admis￾sion [1]. Among ICU patients, 4% to 6% have dialysis￾requiring AKI (D-AKI) [2-4], which is associated with
increased short-term and long-term mortality compared
to ICU patients without this condition [5,6].
End-stage renal disease (ESRD), including need for
chronic dialysis or kidney transplantation, is associated
with considerable costs and impaired quality of life [7].
Studies of hospitalized patients found that D-AKI is an
important risk factor for ESRD [8,9]. However, as AKI is
often secondary to other diseases [1], its impact on sub￾sequent ESRD may differ in ICU patients compared to
other hospitalized patients in general and within sub￾groups of ICU patients. Knowledge of the long-term risk
of ESRD after D-AKI in ICU patients, both overall and
within subgroups, remains sparse, especially for patients

who regain sufficient renal function to discontinue dialy￾sis after an episode of D-AKI.
Previous studies have primarily reported dependency
on dialysis at hospital discharge, or up to 180 days after
initiating acute dialysis in the ICU [10-18]. However,
few studies have followed patients beyond 180 days to
examine the long-term ESRD risk after D-AKI in an
ICU [3,11,19-21].
These studies are all limited by lack of a comparison
cohort of ICU patients without D-AKI [3,11,19-21]. None
examined potentially different impacts in subgroups of
ICU patients [3,11,19-21], and only one ICU-based study
reported the risk of ESRD among D-AKI patients who
initially survived without developing ESRD [11].
We, therefore, conducted a nationwide cohort study
among all ICU patients who survived 90 days or more
after ICU admission, in order to examine the risk of ESRD
among patients with D-AKI compared with other ICU
patients. We examined short-term ESRD risk up to
180 days after ICU admission, and long-term ESRD risk
from 181 days to 5 years for those who did not develop
ESRD within the first 180 days after ICU admission.
Thereby, we were able to both examine the short-term
risk of ESRD after D-AKI, and the long-term risk in those
patients who initially recovered sufficient renal function to
become dialysis independent. In addition, we examined
whether the impact of D-AKI on risk of ESRD varied
across subgroups of ICU patients according to age, gender,
chronic kidney disease, diabetes and surgical status.
Methods
Setting
We conducted this cohort study using prospectively col￾lected data from medical registries in Denmark from 1
January 2005 to 31 December 2010 (Denmark had
5,411,405 inhabitants on 1 January 2005). The Danish
National Health Service provides tax-supported health
care to all Danish residents, including unfettered access to
public hospitals. All intensive care and associated treat￾ments are provided at public hospitals [22]. Denmark has
48 ICUs, including 37 multidisciplinary ICUs, four neuro￾surgical ICUs, three cardiothoracic ICUs, two multidisci￾plinary/cardiothoracic ICUs, one multidisciplinary/
neurosurgical ICU, and onecardiac ICU.
In Denmark, unambiguous linkage of all registries is
possible using a unique civil registration number assigned
to all Danish residents by the Danish Civil Registration
System (CRS). This registry contains complete information
on migration, vital status and exact date of death for all
residents [23].
ICU patients
We used the Danish National Registry of Patients
(DNRP) to identify all adult Danish residents (aged
15 years or older) with a first-time ICU admission from
1 January 2005 to 31 December 2010. Since 1977, it has
been mandatory for hospitals in Denmark to report
information on all in-hospital contacts to the DNRP.
Since 1995, this registry has also included all emergency
room and outpatient clinic visits. Variables in the registry
include civil registration number, hospital and hospital
department, date of hospital admission and discharge,
emergency vs. planned hospital admission, surgical pro￾cedures, major treatments, and one primary diagnosis
(the main reason for current hospitalization assigned by
the discharging physician) and up to 19 secondary diag￾noses. Since 1994, diagnoses have been coded according
to the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revi￾sion (ICD-10) [24]. Data on ICU admissions have been
coded in the DNRP with a high level of accuracy since
2005 [25].
We used the primary ICD-10 diagnosis of the hospita￾lization to categorize patients into nine major disease
groups: septicemia, other infectious disease, endocrine
disease, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease,
gastrointestinal or liver disease, cancer, trauma or poi￾soning and other (please see Additional file 1 for the
ICD-10 codes). In addition, we categorized patients into
five groups according to surgical status: no surgery,
acute cardiac surgery, acute non-cardiac surgery, elective
cardiac surgery and elective non-cardiac surgery [26].
Acute kidney injury
D-AKI was defined as the need for acute dialysis at or
within 90 days after ICU admission, based on a Danish
procedure code for acute dialysis in the DNRP. Acute
dialysis includes dialysis and hemofiltration. All ICU
patients not receiving acute dialysis were defined as
‘other ICU patients’.
End-stage renal disease
Data on ESRD were obtained from the Danish National
Registry on Regular Dialysis and Transplantation
(NRDT). The NRDT, established in 1990, contains
highly valid information on all Danish residents with
chronic kidney disease actively treated with either dialy￾sis or kidney transplantation. Only patients with a per￾manent need of dialysis or need of a kidney transplant
are included in the NRDT, thereby excluding patients
with reversible kidney failure [27]. Registry data include
date of first active treatment, treatment modality and
underlying kidney disease. We defined date of ESRD
diagnosis as 90 days after first active treatment regis￾tered in the NRDT, because chronic disease of the kid￾ney is defined as impairment for more than 90 days
[28]. Patients who died within 90 days after the first
treatment were consequently not considered ESRD
patients (n = 25). Patients with preexisting ESRD or any

previous dialysis treatment were not included in the
study.
Covariates
Data on age, gender and comorbidity were obtained from
the CRS and the DNRP. We obtained data on comorbid￾ities that are associated with D-AKI and also are potential
risk factors for ESRD. Using the DNRP, we identified all
previous inpatient or outpatient clinic diagnoses up to five
years before the current hospitalization. We thus included
previous diagnoses of chronic kidney diseases, diabetes,
hypertension, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarc￾tion, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease
and malignant neoplasms. (Please see Additional file 1 for
relevant codes used in the current study).
Statistical analyses
Patient characteristics, including demographic character￾istics, comorbidity and information from the current
hospitalization, were tabulated for ICU patients with
and without D-AKI. We followed patients who survived
the first 90 days after ICU admission until ESRD, death,
emigration, five years from ICU admission or until 31
December 2011, whichever came first.
We plotted a 5-year cumulative risk curve for ESRD
and calculated 90-day to 180-day, 181-day to 5-year, and
overall 5-year risk of ESRD, using the cumulative risk
method, which takes into account death as a competing
risk [29]. We computed hazard ratios (HRs) for ESRD as
a measure of relative risk, using a Cox proportional
hazards regression model controlling for age group, gen￾der, preexisting chronic kidney disease, diabetes, myocar￾dial infarction, congestive heart failure, peripheral
vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, malignant neo￾plasms and surgical status. The assumptions of propor￾tional hazards were checked graphically by log(-log) plots
and found appropriate.
We examined the potentially different impact in sub￾groups of ICU patients, by stratifying the analyses by age
groups, gender, presence chronic kidney disease, presence
diabetes and surgical status. Analyses were performed
using the statistical software package Stata version 11.1
(StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA).
All data were obtained from Danish registries, which
are available to researchers, and their use does not
require ethical approval or informed consent. The study
was approved by the Danish Data Protection Agency
(record number 2009-41-3987).
Results
Characteristics of the study population
The study population consisted of 107,937 adult ICU
patients. Patients who died during the first 90 days after
ICU admission (n = 33,367), and patients with preexisting
ESRD or any previous dialysis treatment (n = 1,697) were
not considered for the study. Total follow-up time was
230,278 person-years, with a median duration of 3.1 years
(inter-quartile range (IQR): 1.6 to 4.8).
We found that 3,062 (2.8%) patients who survived for
90 days or more had an episode of D-AKI following ICU
admission. Compared to other ICU patients, patients
with D-AKI were slightly older (median age = 65 years
(IQR: 55 to 73) vs. median age 62 = years, (IQR: 46 to
72)), more often male and, in general, with more preex￾isting comorbidity, in particularly chronic kidney disease,
diabetes and hypertension. They also had longer hospital
stays, were more often treated with mechanical ventila￾tion or inotropes/vasopressors, and more often had a pri￾mary diagnosis of septicemia (Table 1).
Risk of end-stage renal disease
The five-year ESRD risk was 11.7% (95% CI: 10.5 to
13.0) for ICU patients with an episode of D-AKI, com￾pared with 0.4% (95% CI: 0.3% to 0.4%) for other ICU
patients (Figure 1).
Risk of ESRD within 90 to 180 Days
Out of the 3,062 ICU patients with D-AKI who survived
for 90 days after ICU admission, 260 developed ESRD
within 180 days following ICU admission (cumulative
risk = 8.5% (95% CI: 7.5% to 9.5%)) compared with 57
patients out of 104,875 other ICU patients (cumulative
risk = 0.1%, 95% CI: 0.0% to 0.1%). This corresponds to
an unadjusted HR for ESRD of 165.9 (95% CI: 124.6 to
221.0) for D-AKI patients compared with other ICU
patients. After adjusting for potential confounders, with
chronic kidney disease being the most important, the
adjusted HR was 105.6 (95% CI: 78.1 to 142.9) (Table 2).
Risk of ESRD within 181 days to 5 years
Among ICU patients who survived 180 days after ICU
admission without developing ESRD, the 181-day to
5-year ESRD risk for patients with D-AKI was 3.8%
(95% CI: 3.0% to 4.8%), compared with 0.3% (95% CI:
0.3% to 0.4%) for other ICU patients. This corresponds
to an unadjusted HR of 13.5 (95% CI: 10.5 to 17.5) and
an adjusted HR of 6.2 (95% CI: 4.7 to 8.1) (Table 2).
Again, chronic kidney disease was the most important
confounder in the adjusted model.
Subgroup analyses
The association between D-AKI and ESRD was evident
within all subgroups of ICU patients in the 90- to 180-
day period (Table 3). Within the 181-day to 5-year
follow-up period, we found that the relative impact of
D-AKI on risk of ESRD was higher for patients without
preexisting chronic kidney disease (adjusted HR = 11.9
(95% CI: 8.5 to 16.8)) than for patients with preexisting
chronic kidney disease (adjusted HR = 2.8 (95% CI: 1.8
to 4.3)) due to a high risk of ESRD even without AKI
(cumulative risk = 7.2% (95% CI: 5.9% to 8.8%)).

Nonetheless, the absolute risk difference between D-AKI
patients and other ICU patients was remained higher for
patients with preexisting kidney disease compared to
patients without this diagnosis (Table 4). The relative
impact of D-AKI on risk of future ESRD was also most
pronounced in the youngest age group, in females and
among elective surgical patients, but similar among dia￾betic and non-diabetic patients (Table 4).
Discussion
Key results
This nationwide population-based cohort study extends
current knowledge by examining and comparing both
short-term and long-term risk of ESRD among ICU
patients with and without an episode of D-AKI.
Among ICU patients who survived for 90 days after
ICU admission, we found the five-year absolute risk of

ESRD to be more than 10% in ICU patients with D￾AKI compared with a risk of less than 0.5% for other
ICU patients. Even among patients who survived more
than 180 days after ICU admission without having
ESRD, the subsequent ESRD risk was six-fold higher
for up to five years among ICU patients with an epi￾sode of D-AKI compared to other ICU patients. The
relative impact of D-AKI on ESRD risk was less pro￾nounced for patients with chronic kidney disease, due
to their high risk of ESRD even without D-AKI.
Existing studies
In line with our observations on the short-term risk of
ESRD, a Swedish cohort study reported that 9.4% (104/
1,102) of ICU patients with D-AKI, who were alive 90
days after commencement of acute dialysis, had started
active treatment for ESRD [11]. Slightly lower estimates
were reported by Bellomo et al. from their randomized
trial that examined the optimal intensity of dialysis.
They found that 5.6% (45/810) of patients with D-AKI
still were dependent on dialysis 90 days after initiating
acute dialysis [12]. However, in contrast, Cartin-Ceba
et al. found that as many as 37.0% (282/784) of ICU
patients who survived and were discharged from hospi￾tal needed dialysis for more than 90 days [13]. Further￾more, small studies including between 17 and 137
surviving ICU patients with D-AKI in various ICU set￾tings have reported that between 4.2% and 28.9% are
still dependent on dialysis 90 or 180 days after initiating
acute dialysis [3,14-18]. This large variation may be
explained primarily by differences in ICU populations
with different baseline renal function.
Our estimates of long-term ESRD risk are also consis￾tent with the Swedish study by Bell et al. [11]. They
found that 3.4% (34/998) of ICU patients with D-AKI
developed ESRD in the period from 90 days up to seven
years after initiating dialysis [11]. Our results are also
consistent with both a Canadian study and a US study
of hospitalized patients, which found an increased risk
of ESRD in patients requiring acute dialysis who initially
recovered enough renal function to discontinue dialysis
[8,9]. The Canadian study by Wald et al. reported an
adjusted HR of 3.23 (95% CI: 2.70 to 3.86) for ESRD
after D-AKI among hospitalized patients who did not
develop ESRD in the first month after hospital dis￾charge, compared to a matched cohort of patients with￾out D-AKI [8]. Results were similar for a subgroup
analysis of mechanically ventilated patients (n = 1,716)
used as a surrogate for ICU admission. The US study by
Hsu et al. examined patients with known chronic kidney
disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate of below 45
ml/minute per 1.73m2
) with D-AKI during hospitaliza￾tion who did not develop ESRD within the first month
after hospital discharge. The study reported an adjusted
HR of 1.47 (95% CI: 0.95 to 2.28) for ESRD [9]. How￾ever, studies including between 39 and 105 surviving
ICU patients in different ICU settings have reported the
proportion still dependent on dialysis to be 13.3%

(8/60), 21.8% (19/87) and 33.3% (13/39) one year after
initiating acute dialysis [3,19,21], and 1.7% (1/60) three
years after initiating acute dialysis [20].
We did not have data on the mechanism of the poten￾tial association between D-AKI and subsequent ESRD.
We speculate that some patients may never recover nor￾mal kidney function after D-AKI, as observed among
patients who developed ESRD in the 90- to 180-day per￾iod. A recent study showed that even patients who
recover normal kidney function after AKI as assessed by
serum creatinine measurements are at considerably
increased risk of subsequent ESRD [30]. However, these
patients may have residual renal function impairment,
which is not detectable by elevated plasma creatinine
[31].
Clinical perspectives
Our study suggests that D-AKI among ICU patients is
a strong risk factor for ESRD for up to five years after
ICU admission. Thus, there may be a need for sys￾tematic post-discharge follow-up of ICU patients with
an episode of D-AKI, in order to avoid further kidney
damage, and for development of prophylactic
strategies.
Strengths and limitations
The strengths of our study include access to a well￾defined population with uniform access to health care,
use of high quality nationwide medical databases, and
virtually complete follow-up data. This minimized selec￾tion and information biases.
Still, some limitations should be considered when inter￾preting our results. First, we lacked detailed nationwide
data on kidney function, such as serum creatinine mea￾surements to estimate glomerular filtration rates (eGFR).
Thus, we were unable to identify and stage pre-existing
chronic kidney disease by eGFR level. Neither were we
able to assess the subsequent risk of kidney dysfunction
less severe than ESRD. However, even if we had creatinine
measurements, the availability of more measurements in
patients with a D-AKI history is likely to introduce bias.
Second, we lacked access to detailed data on type or inten￾sity of dialysis performed in the ICUs. Therefore, we were
unable to examine the association between type or inten￾sity of acute dialysis and ESRD. Third, despite adjustment
for potential confounders, including age group, comorbid￾ity and surgical status, we cannot rule out unmeasured
and residual confounding, for example, by severity of pre￾existing chronic kidney disease.

Conclusions
We found that more than one out of 10 ICU patients
who survived 90 days after ICU admission with D-AKI
developed ESRD during the five years of follow-up,
compared with less than one out of 200 in other ICU
patients. Thus, an episode of D-AKI among ICU
patients is an important risk factor for subsequent
ESRD up to five years after ICU admission. While the
increased risk compared with other ICU patients was
evident within all subgroups of ICU patients, it was
highest within subgroups with low baseline risk of
ESRD, such as young patients and patients without
chronic kidney disease.
Key messages
• One out of 10 ICU patients surviving the first 90
days of D-AKI developed ESRD during the five years of
follow-up.
• D-AKI is an important risk factor for ESRD, even
among patients who initially recovered sufficient kidney
function to discontinue dialysis.
• The relative risk of ESRD was highest within
subgroups with low baseline risk of ESRD, such as
young patients and patients without chronic kidney
disease.
