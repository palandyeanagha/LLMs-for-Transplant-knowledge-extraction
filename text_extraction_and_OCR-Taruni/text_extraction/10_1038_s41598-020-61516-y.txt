Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a serious complication in the intensive care unit (ICU), which may increase 
the mortality of critically ill patients. The red blood cell distribution width (RDW) has proved useful 
as a predictor of short-term prognosis in critically ill patients with AKI. However, it remains unknown 
whether RDW has a prognostic value of long-term all-cause mortality in these patients. The data of 
18279 critically ill patients with AKI at first-time hospital admission were extracted from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database. The tertiles of the RDW values were used to 
divide subjects into three groups, namely RDW<13.6% for the low RDW group, 13.6% ≤ RDW<15.2% 
for the middle RDW group and RDW≥15.2% for the high RDW group. Demographic data, mortality, 
4-year survival time and severity scale scores were compared among groups. The Kaplan-Meier analysis 
and the Cox regression analysis were performed to assess the impact of RDW on all-cause mortality 
in AKI patients. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was done to evaluate the 
prognostic value of RDW on the long-term outcome of critically ill patients with AKI. The median age 
of the enrolled subjects was 65.6 years. AKI patients with a higher RDW value had significantly shorter 
survival time and higher death rate. By the Kaplan-Meier analysis, patients in the higher RDW group 
presented significantly shorter survival time and higher death rate. The Cox regression model indicated 
RDW as an independent risk factor of all-cause mortality of AKI patients (HR 1.219, 95% CI, 1.211 
to 1.228). By the ROC analysis, RDW appeared more efficient in predicting long-term prognosis as 
compared with conventional severity scales. The AUC of RDW (95% CI, 0.712 to 0.725) was significantly 
higher than other severity scale scores. In conclusion, RDW is positively correlated to survival time of 
4-year follow-up in critically ill patients with AKI, and RDW is an independent prognostic factor of long￾term outcomes of these patients.
Acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the most common complications in critically ill patients, which results in 
poor prognosis and high risk of death1
. Approximately 57% of patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) were com￾plicated with AKI, and up to 27% died consequently during hospitalization2
. When AKI occurs concomitantly 
with other severe organ dysfunctions like myocardial infarction or sepsis, the mortality rate is further increased 
to 45% to 60%3

A number of scoring systems are being used to evaluate severity and to predict prognosis of critically ill 
patients, but none of them is specific for those patients complicated with AKI. Moreover, although various bio￾markers are frequently used to predict short-term prognosis and in-hospital mortality of critically ill patients 
with AKI, including urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin4
, right ventricular longitudinal strain5
, 
microRNAs6
 and so forth, long-term prognosis is scarcely evaluated due to the difficulty in long-term follows-up. 
Since AKI may result in permanent injuries of kidney and the long-term risk of death is twice as high in patients 
with AKI as those without AKI7
, prediction of long-term prognosis and early intervention for AKI patients are 
of utmost importance.
The red blood cell distribution width (RDW) represents the variability in size of circulating erythrocytes8
. 
Clinically, RDW is useful for the prognostic prediction of acute disease like sepsis9
 and pancreatitis10. Although 
several studies reported the prognostic efficiency of RDW on AKI, conclusions are inconsistent. Wang et al. 
reported that the short-term prognostic value of RDW was more accurate than Acute Physiology Score III (APS 
III) and the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) in critically ill patients with AKI11. Hu et al. also 
demonstrated that RDW was an independent predictor for AKI and mortality in patients in the coronary care 
unit8
. Instead, Elhosseiny et al. found that RDW did not correlate with the development of contrast-induced 
AKI12. Besides, all previous studies were focused on the short-term prediction efficiency of RDW on AKI. 
Whether RDW can be used to predict the long-term prognosis in AKI patients and the efficiency of RDW therein 
as compared with conventional scales merit further investigation.
In this study, data of critically ill patients complicated with AKI during 48hours after admission to ICU were 
extracted. We hypothesized that RDW is useful in the prediction of long-term prognosis of critically ill patients 
with AKI. We analyzed the relationship between RDW and the survival time of patients at different AKI stages. 
The prognostic value of 4-year mortality as measured by RDW and/or RDW combined with several severity 
scales was evaluated.
Subjects and methods
Data source. Data were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) 
database, which recorded the demographic data, vital signs, medications and other important items of 53,423 
adult admissions to ICUs in the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston from 2001 to 201213. The 
establishment of the MIMIC-III database was approved by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the 
Institutional Review Boards. According to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) 
standards (www.hhs.gov), eighteen identifying data elements were removed from the MIMIC-III database13. 
Our study was conducted entirely on publicly available, anonymized data, thus individual patient consents were 
waived. To get the permission of access to the MIMIC-III database, Linpei Jia passed the Protecting Human 
Research Participants Exam of National Institutes of Health (Record ID: 27638410).
Inclusion and exclusion criteria. AKI was defined by the Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) criteria, 
i.e. serum creatinine (Scr) values increasing ≥ 26.5 μmol/L or 1.5-fold of baseline values during 48 hours, or 
urine out <0.5mL/(kg∙h) for more than 6hours14. In our study, we used the AKIN criteria instead of the Kidney 
Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria for two reasons. One reason is that most data in the 
MIMIC-III database were recorded before the publication of the KDIGO guideline15. Likewise, some other stud￾ies used the AKIN criteria for the same reason16. The other reason is that during the 7-day follow-up, confounding 
factors, such as antibiotics and hospital infection, may interfere the kidney function, thus renal function was 
assessed and AKI was diagnosed within 48 hours after admission17. Because Scr values within 3 months before 
admission were not recorded in the database, the first measurement of Scr within 24hours after admitted into 
ICU was set as the baseline18.
Included patients were those: (1) with first admission to ICU during hospital stays; (2) with AKI during 
48hours after admitted to ICU; (3) aged ≥18 years old and ≤89 years old; (4) were followed-up for 4 years by the 
CareVue system13. Patients without any RDW data within 24hours after admission or missing >5% indices were 
not included in our study. Patients with hospitalization duration longer than 100 days were excluded19.
Data extraction. Data of each patient were extracted from the MIMIC-III database by the Structured Query 
Language, including age, sex, admission type, ethnicity, marriage, status of renal replacement therapy, RDW 
values, the survival time, days of hospital stay, and days of ICU stay (Additional File 1). If RDW was meas￾ured for several times within 24 hours after the ICU entry, data of the first time were used. Comorbidities were 
defined as per the Implementation of the International Statistical Classification of Disease and Related Health 
Problems, 10th Revision (ICD-10) coding systems20. APS III21, the Modified Logistic Organ Dysfunction System 
(MLODS)22, SOFA23, the Oxford Acute Severity of Illness Score (OASIS)24 and the Systemic Inflammatory 
Response Syndrome (SIRS) status25 were calculated according to the physiological and laboratory parameters in 
the MIMIC-III database for estimation of prognosis in AKI patients. All methods were carried out in accordance 
with relevant guidelines to protect the privacy of patients.
Grouping. The data distribution of RDW in all the enrolled subjects was calculated; the lower tertile and the 
upper tertile were 13.6% and 15.2% respectively. We hence divided all of the subjects into three groups based on 
the tertiles of RDW values26,27, namely the low RDW group (RDW<13.6%), the middle RDW group (13.6% 
≤ RDW<15.2%), and the high RDW group (RDW≥15.2%). Thereafter, we divided patients into subgroups 
according to AKI stages which are based on the AKIN guidelines14. In specific, AKI stage 1 was defined as AKI 
with an increase of Scr values ≥1.5–1.9 folds or ≥26.5 μmol/L, or urine output <0.5 ml/(kg∙h) for more than 
6hours; AKI stage 2 was defined as AKI with an increase of Scr values ≥2.0–2.9 folds or urine output to <0.5ml/
(kg∙h) for more than 12 hours; AKI stage 3 was defined as AKI with an increase of Scr values ≥ 3.0 folds or

≥354 μmol/L, or urine output <0.3ml/(kg∙h) for more than 24 hours. Patients with an anuric status >12 hours 
were also classified as AKI stage 3.
Outcomes. The MIMIC-III database provides the follow-up data by two systems, namely the Philips CareVue 
Clinical Information System (models M2331A and M1215A; Philips Health-care, Andover, MA) for four years 
and the iMDsoft MetaVision ICU (iMDsoft, Needham, MA) for 90 days. Because we aimed at investigating the 
long-term prognostic effects of RDW, the four-year outcomes after ICU admission in the CareVue system were 
used. The all-cause death was used as the end-point in our study. We extracted the death status recorded in 
CareVue system. Since the MIMIC-III database was connected with social security database, which ensures the 
integrity of follow-up data, we also replenished all-cause death data in four years for patients without recording 
in the CareVue system.
Statistics. The trend test of one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for the analysis of continu￾ous data, and the trend test of Chi-square test was used for categorical data. The linear regression model, the 
Kaplan-Meier (K-M) curve and the Cox regression model were utilized to analyze the relationship between RDW 
and survival in AKI patients. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to com￾pare the area under the ROC curve (AUC), which represented the prognostic efficiency. Statistical analyses were 
performed with the SPSS 22.0 software (SPSS, IBM, NY, US), GraphPad Prism 7.0 (GraphPad Software, San 
Diego, US) and the Medcalc 18.5.0 software (MedCalc Software, Ostend, Belgium). Statistical significance was 
defined as P<0.05. Graphs were generated by Medcalc 18.5.0 and GraphPad Prism 7.0 (GraphPad Software, 
California, US).
Results
Eighteen thousand two hundred and seventy-nine patients were enrolled. Initially, 57787 sub￾jects were selected from MIMIC-III. After screening, 18279 subjects with mean age of 63.4±16.2 years were 
enrolled (Fig. 1). The demographic data of the enrolled patients were shown in Table 1. Among these patients, 
58.3% were males, and 82.3% were admitted via the emergency room. As the database was constructed in the 
United States, a majority of the included patients were Caucasian (69.6%). According to the KDIGO guideline, 
patients at AKI stage 2 accounted for 37.2%, 32.4% of patients were at AKI stage 3, while the others were at AKI 
stage 1. Only 8.8% of all subjects were treated with renal replacement therapy. Higher severity scale scores rep￾resent more severity in critically ill patients with AKI (Table 1). The leading comorbidities were congestive heart 
Figure 1. Flowchart of subject screening. Initially, data of 57787 subjects were extracted from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database. Changes of serum creatinine and urine output 
within 48 hours after admissions to ICUs were calculated. Then 23701 subjects were excluded as non-acute 
kidney injury (AKI) patients. Because age of patients over 89 years were marked as 300 or more in the database 
to protect the privacy, we further excluded 1789 senilities for analysis. After filtering out 65 subjects younger 
than 18-year-old, 32231 adults were further screened for hospital stays. Hence, 32183 subjects with hospital stay 
less than 100 days were checked for data integrity, and 459 subjects without red blood cell distribution width 
(RDW), 52 subjects without sex information and 162 subjects with wrong survival time were excluded. Since 
the MetaVision system only provided 90-day follow-up data, only 18279 patients with complete follow-up data 
for 4 years were finally enrolled in our study.

failure and chronic pulmonary disease, which accounted for 31.9% and 18.5%, respectively, and 15.9% of the 
patients were complicated with renal failure. The median hospital stay of all patients was 7.9 days and the median 
ICU stay was 2.7 days. The all-cause death rate for all subjects was 43.6%.
RDW values were negatively correlated with survival time of critically ill patients with 
AKI. Demographic data were compared, and all parameters, including gender, age, admission type, marriage, 
ethnicity, AKI stage, traditional severity scores, comorbidities, ICU stay and hospital stay, have shown differences 
among the three RDW groups (all P<0.01, Table 1). In all subjects, the death rate was increased from low to high 
RDW groups (23.1% for the low RDW group, 40% for the middle RDW group, 65.8% for the high RDW group, 
Table 1 and Fig. 2A), while the survival time was decreased from low to high RDW groups (Fig. 2B). Similar 
trends in death rate and survival time were found at each AKI stage (Fig. 2A,B). In the linear regression model, 
survival time was negatively correlated to RDW values (r=0.35, P<0.01).
RDW was an independent risk factor of 4-year all-cause mortality in critically ill patients with 
AKI. By the K-M analysis, higher RDW values were associated with lower survival rate and shorter survival

time (P<0.01 by logrank test for trend, Fig. 3A). We also conducted subgroup analysis of AKI stage 1, stage 2 
and stage 3 groups respectively by the K-M curve, while patients with higher RDW values also showed shorter 
survival time and higher death rate at each stage (P<0.01 by logrank test for trend, Fig. 3B–D). Then the Cox 
regression models were performed for the association between RDW and all-cause mortality independently as 
well as adjusted by other severity scale scores. RDW was independently related to the all-cause mortality of AKI 
patients both in unadjusted and adjusted Cox regression models (P<0.01, Table 2). RDW was also shown as an 
independent risk factor for all-cause mortality at each AKI stage. In Cox regression models, RDW remained a risk 
factor of mortality of AKI patients before and after adjustment (Table 3).
Effects of RDW on 4-year all-cause mortality were not influenced by the history of renal fail￾ure in critically ill patients with AKI. Baseline renal function may have an impact on the incidence and 
mortality of AKI. Hence, we did the survival analysis of RDW on patients without renal failure. The K-M curves 
indicated that high RDW values were associated with higher all-cause mortality and shorter survival time in all 
subjects as well as patients at different AKI stages (P<0.01, Fig. 4). Thus, regardless of the baseline renal function, 
RDW was an independent risk factor for long-term mortality in AKI patients.
RDW predicted long-term prognosis better than conventional severity scales. The ROC anal￾ysis was performed to evaluate the long-term prognostic value of RDW compared with conventional severity 
scale scores, including APS III, MLODS, OASIS, SIRS and SOFA. The AUC of RDW for all patients was 0.718 
(95% CI, 0.712–0.725), which was significantly higher than other severity scale scores (P <0.01, Fig. 5A and 
Table 4). For patients at AKI stage 1, RDW with AUC of 0.713 (95% CI, 0.701–0.725) had a better prognostic 
value than conventional severity scales (P<0.01, Fig. 5B and Table 4). However, for patients with AKI stage 2 
and 3, AUC of RDW showed no significant difference from APS III (P=0.297 for AKI stage 2, P=0.781 for AKI 
stage 3, Fig. 5C,D and Table 4). When RDW was combined with each severity score, AUCs were significantly 
increased after combination as compared with APS III, MLODS, OASIS, SOFA or RDW alone, respectively (all 
P<0.01, Figure S1 and Table 4). However, no difference of AUC was found after combination of RDW with 
SIRS (P=0.080, Figure S1 and Table 4). Taken together, RDW better predicts long-term prognosis of critically 
ill patients with AKI than traditional severity scoring systems. RDW may also improve the prognostic efficiency 
of APS III.
Figure 2. Relationship between red blood cell distribution width (RDW) and all-cause death in critically 
ill patients with acute kidney injury (AKI). AKI patients were divided into the low (RDW<13.6%), middle 
(13.6% ≤ RDW<15.2%) and high (RDW≥15.2%) RDW groups according to the first RDW measurement. 
Death rates increased from the low RDW group to the high RDW group for all patients (23.10%, 40.00% and 
65.80% for the low, the middle and the high RDW groups respectively, P<0.01, A). The same relationship was 
also found at AKI stage 1 (23.20%, 39.70% and 64.50% for the low, middle and high RDW groups respectively, 
P<0.01), stage 2 (24.50%, 39.30% and 61.30% for the low, middle and high RDW groups respectively, P<0.01) 
and stage 3 (21.10%, 41.20% and 70.80% for the low, middle and high RDW groups respectively, P<0.01). With 
the RDW increasing, survival time decreased from 1205.7±509.5 days to 687.0±635.8 days (P<0.01, B). In 
subgroup analysis, survival time of each RDW groups were also compared at each AKI stage separately, and AKI 
patients of low RDW group had the longest survival time at all stages (P<0.01, B).

Discussion
Clinically, RDW is a common parameter for evaluation of anemia and inflammation. In recent years, much atten￾tion has been paid to the relationship between renal function and RDW. In this study, we explored the association 
between RDW and long-term outcomes of 18279 critically ill patients with AKI. Higher levels of RDW predicted 
shorter survival time and higher long-term death rate. Our findings suggest that RDW might be a potential pre￾dictor of all-cause mortality of critically ill patients with AKI.
First, we explored the association between RDW and survival time. We demonstrated that higher RDW 
predicted worse prognosis of AKI patients. Our results were consistent with previous studies on short-term 
Figure 3. Kaplan-Meier (K-M) survival curves for 4-year all-cause mortalities of critically ill patients with acute 
kidney injury (AKI). The risk of 4-year overall mortality of each red blood cell distribution width (RDW) group 
in all participants was shown (A). Patients with RDW≥15.2% had the highest all-cause mortality. In subgroup 
analysis, the same changes of the Kaplan-Meier curves were observed at AKI stage 1 (B), stage 2 (C) and stage 3 (D).

Figure 4. Kaplan-Meier (K-M) survival curves for 4-year overall mortalities of critically ill patients with acute 
kidney injury (AKI) without comorbidity of renal failure. To eliminate the influences of baseline renal function, 
we did the Kaplan-Meier analysis for each red blood cell distribution width (RDW) groups in patients without 
renal failure. The survival rate of the low RDW group was significantly higher than the middle and high RDW 
groups (P<0.01) for all patients in the 4-year follow-up (A). Higher risk of mortality was also shown in the high 
RDW group at AKI stage 1 (P<0.01, B), 2 (P<0.01, C) and 3 (P<0.01, D) respectively.

AKI. Different from previous studies, however, we emphasized that the baseline RDW values also determined the 
long-term death rate and survival time in multiple-cause AKI.
To adjust for the confounding of baseline renal function, we further examined the relationship between RDW 
and long-term all-cause mortalities of AKI patients without comorbidity of renal failure. Elevation of blood 
RDW levels has been used to predict mortalities in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients both with and without 
hemodialysis31,32. For patients with normal baseline renal function, RDW was positively correlated to 4-year 
survival rates, which was consistent with Odutayo’s results33. Hence RDW may serve as an independent factor of 
long-term outcomes of critically ill patients with AKI.
We also compared the prognostic value of RDW with traditional severity scores. Oh’s team analyzed the data 
of 470 renal replacement therapy-treated patients with AKI and found that SOFA with the AUC of 0.694 predicted 
more accurately than RDW with the AUC of 0.58634. Mizuno and colleagues showed the potential predictive abil￾ity of RDW combined with the Mehran risk score but not RDW only for contrast-induced AKI in myocardial 
infarction patients35. Acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II scores were also confirmed to be better 
than RDW in predicting in-hospital mortality as well as 2-year mortality8
. Inconsistent with previous studies, 
however, RDW showed a better predictive value of four-year mortality than commonly used severity scoring 
systems in our study. This inconsistency might be due to differences in sample size and selection of subjects. On 
one hand, previous studies usually enrolled no more than 1000 subjects, which is far less than the sample size in 
Figure 5. Receiver operating curve (ROC) analyses of predictors of acute kidney injury (AKI) and mortality 
in intensive care units (ICU) patients. The area under ROC curve (AUC) of red blood cell distribution width 
(RDW) were compared with Acute Physiology Score III (APS III), the Modified Logistic Organ Dysfunction 
System (MLODS), the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), the Oxford Acute Severity of Illness Score 
(OASIS) and the Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS). RDW values of all subjects (AUC=0.718, 
A) and AKI stage 1 subjects (AUC=0.713, B) were significantly higher than other severity scale scores (P<0.01). 
However, at AKI stages 2 and 3, the AUCs of RDW (AUC=0.684 for stage 2 in C and AUC=0.757 for stage 3 in 
D) showed no difference in comparison with APS III (P=0.297 for stage 2 and P=0.781 for stage 3).

our study. A large sample could make the results more precise, stable and reliable36. On the other hand, subjects 
in the present study were critically ill patients with AKI caused by various reasons. Heterogeneous causes of AKI 
might also influence the prognostic efficiency of RDW. Likewise, different factors that may influence short-term 
and long-term outcomes should be addressed as well37. Although traditional severity scales are used mainly to 
evaluate disease severity and short-term prognosis of acute diseases, studies have proved their usefulness in the 
long-term prognosis prediction. For example, Pekkarinen’s study indicated that SOFA was associated with 1-year 
outcome and healthcare costs of patients with cardiac arrest38. Hagen’s team found that SIRS could predict poor 
long-term functional outcome after intracerebral hemorrhage39. In line with these findings, we also showed that 
either RDW or severity scores could be used to predict the long-term prognosis of AKI patients; RDW appeared 
to be even more efficient.
Although the predictive value of RDW on all-cause mortalities has been revealed, the mechanism remains 
unknown. Both inflammation40 and oxidative stress41 may play crucial roles. When inflammation occurs, iron 
metabolism and bone marrow function are inhibited, and the proliferation and maturation of erythrocytes are 
inhibited40, leading to an increase of RDW values. Meanwhile, the severity of AKI is related to systematic and 
intrarenal inflammation42. SIRS mainly represents an inflammation status of whole body, and our results revealed 
that SIRS values were increased in the high RDW group. Therefore, RDW could predict the prognosis of AKI par￾tially by reflecting the levels of inflammation. AKI patients in ICU are often complicated with activation of oxi￾dative stress including disturbed metabolism, sepsis, and hemodynamic dysregulations43. Oxidative stress plays 
key roles in the erythroid cell cycle, differentiation and maturation, and RDW has been found associated with 
various oxidative stress biomarkers, such as serum malondialdehyde and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, in critically 
ill patients44. Usually, the multi-organ dysfunction is accompanied with severe oxidative stress. Hence, elevations 
of MLODS and SOFA were shown in the high RDW groups.
The large sample size is the advantage of our study. The complete follow-up data make it possible to investi￾gate the long-term prognosis, which is difficult to be observed in cohort studies. However, limitations should be 
acknowledged. First, as mentioned in the Subjects and methods section, the AKIN criteria instead of the KDIGO 
criteria was used due to the intrinsic drawback of the MIMIC-III database. Second, some important information 
was not recorded in the MIMIC-III database, including Scr during the previous 3 months and the past medi￾cal history of end stage renal disease (ESRD), and hence estimation of previousrenal function and exclusion of 
patients with ESRD were impossible. Third, given the missing items of past medical histories in the MIMIC-III 
database, patients with hematological diseases or renal anemia were difficult to distinguish and select. Hence, 
effects of hematological diseases on the prognostic values of RDW were not evaluated. Besides, the missing data 
of some other RDW-influencing pre-existing conditions, such as serious infections, autoimmune diseases and 
so forth, also made stratified analyses impossible. Fourth, because the major adverse events after discharge were 
not followed or recorded, the predictive value of RDW on cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events was not 
evaluated as well.
Further improvement in the MIMIC-III database may make up for the above-mentioned limitations. Regular 
follows-up for up to 3 to 6 years are necessary. Detailed past medical history, medication history and the exact 
cause of death should be recorded, which are helpful to explore the prognostic values of RDW on important com￾plications in critically ill patients with AKI.
Conclusion
Based on the clinical data of 18279 AKI patients in MIMIC-III database, a negative correlation was found between 
RDW and all-cause mortality. RDW proved to be a predictive parameter of long-term prognosis of critically ill 
patients with AKI.
