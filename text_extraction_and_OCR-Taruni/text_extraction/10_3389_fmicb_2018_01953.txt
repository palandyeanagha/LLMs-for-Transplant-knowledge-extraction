Weaning disturbs the intestinal barrier function and increases the risk of infection in
piglets. Probiotics exert beneficial health effects, mainly by reinforcing the intestinal
epithelium and modulating the gut microbiota. However, the mechanisms of action,
and especially, the specific regulatory effects of modulated microbiota by probiotics
on the intestinal epithelium have not yet been elucidated. The present study aimed to
decipher the protective effects of the probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum strain ZLP001 on
the intestinal epithelium and microbiota as well as the effects of modulated microbiota
on epithelial function. Paracellular permeability was measured with fluorescein
isothiocyanate-dextran (FD-4). Gene and protein expression levels of tight junction (TJ)
proteins, proinflammatory cytokines, and host defense peptides were determined by RT￾qPCR, ELISA, and western blot analysis. Short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) concentrations
were measured by ion chromatography. Fecal microbiota composition was assessed
by high-throughput sequencing. The results showed that pretreatment with 108 colony
forming units (CFU) mL−1 of L. plantarum ZLP001 significantly counteracted the
increase in gut permeability to FD-4 induced by 106 CFU mL−1 enterotoxigenic
Escherichia coli (ETEC). In addition, L. plantarum ZLP001 pretreatment alleviated
the reduction in TJ proteins (claudin-1, occludin, and ZO-1) and downregulated
proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8, and TNFα expression and secretion caused
by ETEC. L. plantarum ZLP001 also significantly increased the expression of the
host defense peptides pBD2 and PG1-5 and pBD2 secretion relative to the control.
Furthermore, L. plantarum ZLP001 treatment affected piglet fecal microbiota. The
abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria Anaerotruncus and Faecalibacterium was
significantly increased in L. plantarum ZLP001-treated piglets, and showed a positive
correlation with fecal butyric and acetic acid concentrations. In addition, the cell
density of Clostridium sensu stricto 1, which may cause epithelial inflammation, was
decreased after L. plantarum ZLP001 administration, while the beneficial Lactobacillus
was significantly increased. Our findings suggest that L. plantarum ZLP001 fortifies
the intestinal barrier by strengthening epithelial defense functions and modulating gut
microbiota.

Wang et al. Lactobacillus Treatment of Weaned Piglets
INTRODUCTION
The sudden changes in diet and the physical and social
environment associated with weaning are significant piglet
stressors. Elevated plasma cortisol and corticotropin-releasing
factor levels are indices of weaning stress (Van der Meulen
et al., 2010). The feed intake of most piglets after weaning is
relatively low because of the dietary change from liquid milk
to solid feed. Decreased feed and water intake cause small
intestinal villous atrophy (Lallès et al., 2004), which in turn results
in diminished digestive and absorptive capacities and reduced
growth rate. Maternal separation and changes in environment
are social and environmental stresses that cause tension in piglets
and weaken their immune system. Furthermore, the dietary and
environmental changes associated with weaning are associated
with a substantial modification of the intestinal microbiota and
may cause post-weaning diarrhea and enteric infection (Lallès
et al., 2007). Perturbations of the intestinal epithelium, weakened
immune system, and modified intestinal microbiota induced by
weaning stress can profoundly impact piglet health and growth
performance and may, in some cases, lead to mortality (Campbell
et al., 2013).
The intestine plays a critical role in the defense against
harmful external factors. Poor intestinal defense renders piglets
more susceptible to weaning stress, leading to infection
and disease. In post-weaning piglets, transepithelial electrical
resistance (TER) significantly decreases while paracellular
permeability increases (Hu et al., 2013). The expression of
the tight junction (TJ) proteins occludin, claudin-1, and ZO￾1 decreases during weaning, and as a result, barrier integrity
is impaired. This facilitates pathogen penetration and permits
bacteriotoxins to enter the body. Weaned piglets also exhibit
elevated expression of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF￾α and IL-6 (Hu et al., 2013), which is associated with weak
epithelium and inflammatory disease. Furthermore, weaning
lowers intestinal microbial diversity and alters the microbiota
composition in that the abundance of obligate anaerobic bacteria
decreases and that of facultative anaerobic bacteria increases
(Winter et al., 2013), which weakens intestinal function. For
instance, Lactobacillus spp. and other beneficial bacteria play
an important role in protecting against intestinal pathogens,
and the reduction in their abundance after weaning enhances
disease risk (Konstantinov et al., 2006). S. enterica and E. coli are
two major pathogens infecting piglets. An increased abundance
of these pathogens in the intestine often results in severe
infection.
Evidence indicates that the consumption of probiotic bacteria
contributes to intestinal function by maintaining paracellular
permeability, enhancing the physical mucous layer, stimulating
the immune system, and modulating resident microbiota
composition and activity (Boirivant and Strober, 2007). The
regulatory effects of probiotics on human, pig, and chicken
intestinal homeostasis have been studied extensively (Van Baarlen
et al., 2013; Cisek and Binek, 2014; Gresse et al., 2017), and
interactions between probiotic and commensal bacteria and
the epithelial barrier are thought to be the main underlying
mechanism. Lactobacillus is a predominant indigenous bacterial
genus found in the human and animal gastrointestinal tract, and
species of this genus are commonly used as probiotics. In vitro
and in vivo studies in various cell lines and animal models have
demonstrated that L. plantarum MB452, L. casei, L. rhamnosus
GG, and L. reuteri I5007 affect TER and epithelial permeability
and modulate TJ protein expression and distribution (Anderson
et al., 2010; Eun et al., 2011; Patel et al., 2012; Yang et al.,
2015). Lactobacillus spp. boost the immune system by promoting
the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-10
and IFN-γ (Lactobacillus GG, Kopp et al., 2008; L. rhamnosus
CRL1505, Villena et al., 2014), or by inhibiting that of pro￾inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α (L. reuteri
LR1, Wang et al., 2016; L. plantarum 2142, Farkas et al., 2014).
L. reuteri I5007 and L. plantarum DSMZ 12028 can modulate
the synthesis of antimicrobials by the intestinal epithelium
(Paolillo et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2017). Multiple studies have
confirmed that Lactobacillus spp., such as L. salivarius UCC118
and L. acidophilus, significantly modulate resident intestinal
microbiota composition and activity (Riboulet-Bisson et al., 2012;
Li et al., 2017). Thus, through enhancing intestinal epithelial
function, probiotics improve host health. However, the effects
of probiotics on intestinal barrier function are strain-dependent
and not ubiquitous. The unique effects of specific strains on
the intestinal epithelium and microbiota, and whether the
modulated microbiota affect intestinal epithelial function remain
unclear.
The results of our previous studies indicated that dietary
supplementation with Lactobacillus plantarum ZLP001 isolated
from healthy piglet intestinal tract (Wang et al., 2011) improves
growth performance and antioxidant status in post-weaning
piglets (Wang et al., 2012). However, its impact on intestinal
barrier function and microbiota, and the interaction between
barrier function and microbiota after L. plantarum ZLP001
treatment remained to be investigated. In this study, the impact
of L. plantarum ZLP001 on intestinal epithelial function was
evaluated by measuring gut permeability and the expression of
TJ proteins, inflammatory cytokines, and host defense peptides
(HDP). Further, we evaluated the ability of this strain to
regulate microbiota composition and community structure.
The regulatory effects of the microbiota modulated by the
probiotic strain on intestinal epithelium function were also
analyzed.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bacteria and Culture Conditions
L. plantarum ZLP001 was isolated in our laboratory from the
intestine of a healthy piglet. It was identified by the China Center
of Industrial Culture Collection (Beijing, China) and preserved
in the China General Microbiological Culture Collection Center
(CGMCC No. 7370). It was grown in improved De Man, Rogosa,
and Sharpe liquid medium (10 g peptone, 5 g yeast powder, 20 g
glucose, 10 g beef extract, 5 g sodium acetate, 2 g ammonium
citrate dibasic, 2 g dipotassium phosphate, 0.58 g magnesium
sulfate, 0.19 g manganese sulfate, 1 mL of Tween 80, and water
to 1,000 mL; pH 6.5) at 37◦C under anaerobic conditions.

Wang et al. Lactobacillus Treatment of Weaned Piglets
Enteropathic E. coli strain expressing F4 (F4+ ETEC),
serotype O149:K91, K88ac, was obtained from the China
Veterinary Culture Collection Center. It was grown in Luria￾Bertani medium (Oxoid, Basingstoke, United Kingdom) at 37◦C.
Cell Line and Culture Conditions
The porcine intestinal epithelial cell line (IPEC-J2) used in
this study was purchased from JENNIO Biological Technology
(Guangzhou, China). It was originally derived from the jejuna
of neonatal piglets. The cells were cultured in DMEM/F12
(Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium/nutrient mixture F-12, a
1:1 mixture of DMEM and Ham’s F-12; Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA, United States) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, United States), streptomycin
(100 µg mL−1
), and amphotericin B (0.5 µg mL−1
). IPEC￾J2 cells were cultured at 37◦C in a 5% CO2/95% air
atmosphere and 90% relative humidity. Cells were separated
at each passage with 0.25% w/v trypsin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA, United States) and replenished with fresh media every
2–3 days.
Paracellular Permeability Determination
Changes in paracellular permeability after L. plantarum ZLP001
treatment were determined with fluorescein isothiocyanate￾dextrans (FD-4; average molecular mass, 4.4 kDa; Sigma-Aldrich
Corp., St. Louis, MO, United States) according to the method
reported by Wang et al. (2016) with some modifications. IPEC-2
cells were seeded into 6-well Transwell insert chambers (0.4 µm
pore size; Corning, Inc., Corning, NY, United States) at a density
of 2.5 × 105
cells per well and were cultured to form differentiated
monolayers. The cells were pretreated or not with L. plantarum
ZLP001 (LP, 108 CFU mL−1
) for 6 h and then challenged or not
with 106 CFU mL−1 ETEC for 3 h. FD-4 was added to the apical
sides of the IPEC-J2 cell monolayers at a final concentration of
1 mg mL−1
. After incubation, medium (100 µL) was sampled
from the basolateral chambers, and the FD-4 concentration
was quantified using a fluorescence microplate reader (FLx800;
BioTek, Winooski, VT, United States). Calibration curves were
plotted with an FD-4 gradient series. All experiments were carried
out in triplicate.
IPEC-J2 Cells Treatment With
L. plantarum ZLP001 and ETEC
IPEC-J2 cells were seeded into 6-well plates (Corning, Inc.,
Corning, NY, United States) at a density of 2.5 × 105
cells
per well. At 80% confluence, the cells were pretreated or not
with L. plantarum ZLP001 (LP, 108 CFU mL−1
) at 37◦C for
6 h. Then, the cells were washed three times with PBS and the
supernatant was removed. The cells were challenged or not with
106 CFU mL−1 ETEC at 37◦C for 3 h. Fresh medium containing
bacteria was prepared by resuspending and diluting collected
bacteria in DMEM/F12 without FBS or streptomycin/penicillin.
After incubation, the cells were rinsed with PBS three times and
collected for subsequent assays. Culture medium supernatants
were collected simultaneously. All experiments were carried out
in triplicate.
Determination of mRNA Expression
The mRNA expression levels of TJ proteins, cytokines, and
HDPs were determined by quantitative real-time PCR (RT￾qPCR). IPEC-J2 cells collected after incubation were lysed
with RNAzol (MRC, Cincinnati, OH, United States). Total
RNA was extracted following the manufacturer’s instructions.
RNA concentrations were determined with a NanoDrop
spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA,
United States) and purity was verified by A260:A280 and
A260:A230 absorbance ratios. The RNA was reverse transcribed
with an iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories Ltd.,
Hercules, CA, United States) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. qPCR was performed using iTaq Universal SYBR
Green Supermix (Bio-Rad Laboratories Ltd., Hercules, CA,
United States) on a QuantStudio 3 real-time PCR system
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States).
Porcine-specific primers are listed in Supplementary Table S1.
The expression of each gene was normalized to that of
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) to yield a
relative transcript level. PCR conditions were 95◦C for 10 min
followed by 40 amplification cycles (95◦C for 30 s, 60◦C for 30 s,
and 72◦C for 20 s). Relative gene expression was calculated by the
2
−11CT method.
Protein Extraction and Immunoblotting
Total protein from IPEC-J2 cells was extracted after the various
treatments using a lysis buffer containing 150 mM NaCl, 1%
Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 50 mM
Tris–HCl adjusted to pH 7.4 and supplemented with a protease
inhibitor cocktail (Applygene, Beijing, China). The IPEC-J2 cells
were collected into precooled lysis buffer and kept on ice for
30 min. The lysed samples were centrifuged at 4◦C and 12,000 × g
for 5 min to collect the supernatants. Protein concentrations
were determined with a Bicinchoninic Acid Protein Assay
Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States).
After separation on 10% SDS polyacrylamide gel, proteins
were electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride
membranes (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA, United States). The
membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk and then incubated
with primary antibodies overnight (∼12–16 h) at 4◦C. They
were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
secondary antibodies for 1 h at 20–25◦C. The antibodies used
are listed in Supplementary Table S2. Immunoreactive proteins
were detected on a ChemiDoc XRS imaging system (Bio-Rad
Laboratories Ltd., Hercules, CA, United States) using Western
Blotting Luminol Reagent (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas,
TX, United States). Band densities were analyzed with ImageJ
(National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, United States).
Results were calculated and recorded as the protein abundance
relative to β-actin.
Proinflammatory Cytokine and Porcine
β-Defensin 2 (pBD2) Measurement
Proinflammatory cytokines and porcine β-defensin 2 were
measured by an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
Cell culture medium supernatant (500 µL) was centrifuged

at 4,000 × g for 10 min and then passed through a
0.25-µm pore diameter filter (Corning Inc., Corning, NY,
United States). The concentrations of interleukin 6 (IL-6),
interleukin 8 (IL-8), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), and
pBD2 were determined with porcine-specific ELISA Kits (Abcam,
Cambridge, United Kingdom), according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
Animal Groups and Diets
The experimental protocol was reviewed and approved by
the Ethics Committee of the Institute of Animal Husbandry
and Veterinary Medicine, Beijing Academy of Agriculture and
Forestry Sciences, Beijing, PRC. Humane animal care was
practiced throughout the trial.
Ten post-weaning piglets (siblings; Large White × Landrace;
8.54 ± 0.58 kg) were assigned to L. plantarum ZLP001 treatment
or placebo control groups. Each group consisted of two males and
three females. Animals were raised at the Beijing Xiqingminfeng
Farm (Beijing, China) in a separate room decontaminated prior
to the study and were housed at 25–28◦C. Each piglet was
kept in an individual 1.28-m2 pen with a mesh floor. Each
pen contained a feeder and a water nipple. Free access to feed
and water was provided throughout the 30-day trial. Piglets
received a complete feed specially formulated according to the
NRC (2012) and the Feeding Standard of Swine (2004). Detailed
information about the diet is shown in Supplementary Table S3.
The control group received a basal diet supplemented with
placebo (2 g kg−1
feed). The treatment group was administered
the basal diet supplemented with freeze-dried L. plantarum
ZLP001 (5.0 × 109 CFU g−1
, 2 g kg−1
feed).
Fecal Sample Collection and Microbiota
Analysis
Fresh fecal samples were individually collected from piglet
recta at the end of the feeding experiment. The samples were
immediately transferred to the laboratory and processed for
genomic DNA extraction with an E.Z.N.A. Stool DNA Kit
(Omega Bio-Tek, Norcross, GA, United States) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. V3+V4 hypervariable
sequences of 16S rDNA were amplified by PCR with TransStart
FastPfu DNA Polymerase (TransGen Biotech Ltd., Beijing,
China) with barcode-modified universal primers (forward:
338F, 50
-ACTCCTACGGGAGGCAGCA-30
; reverse: 806R,
5
0
-GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT-30
). Amplified products
were separated on 2% agarose gels and extracted and purified
with an AxyPrep DNA Gel Extraction Kit (Axygen Biosciences,
Union City, CA, United States). Barcoded V3+V4 amplicons
were sequenced by the paired-end method with Illumina MiSeq
at Shanghai Majorbio Bio-pharm Technology Co. (Shanghai,
China). Raw sequences were denoised using Trimmomatic
and FLASH software and filtered according to their barcodes
and primer sequences with QIIME v. 1.5.0. Chimeras were
identified and excluded using the UCHIME algorithm v.
4.2.40. Optimized, high-quality sequences were clustered into
operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at 97% sequence identity
against a subset of the Silva 16S sequence database (Release
1191
). Taxon-dependent analysis was carried out using the
Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) naive Bayesian classifier,
with an 80% bootstrap cutoff. Alpha diversity (Shannon and
Simpson indices), abundance (Chao1 and ACE indices), and
Good’s coverage and rarefaction were analyzed with mothur v.
1.31.2. Principle coordinates analysis (PCoA) was conducted
to visualize differences in fecal community composition. PCoA
plots were generated on the basis of Bray–Curtis indices. The
linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) algorithm was
used to identify the taxa responsible for the differences between
the treatment and control groups. The biomarkers used in the
present study had an effect-size threshold of two.
Determination of Fecal Short-Chain Fatty
Acid (SCFA) Concentrations
Fecal SCFA concentrations were determined following modified
procedures of Qiu and Jin (2002). Half-gram fecal samples
were homogenized in 10 mL of double-distilled water. After
centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min, the supernatants were
removed and filtered through 0.25-µm-pore filters (Corning Inc.,
Corning, NY, United States). Acetic, propionic, and butyric acids
were measured with an ion chromatography system (Dionex
Corp., Sunnyvale, CA, United States).
Statistical Analysis
SPSS v. 22.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, United States) was
used for statistical analysis. The FD-4 concentration and mRNA
expression levels were analyzed by one-way ANOVA. Fecal
SCFA concentrations were analyzed with unpaired Student’s two￾tailed t-tests. The results are expressed as the mean ± standard
error of the mean (SEM). The significance level was P < 0.05.
Correlations between fecal SCFA concentration and intestinal￾associated microbiota were examined with Spearman’s rank￾order correlation test in R v. 3.2.1.
RESULTS
Effects of L. plantarum ZLP001 on
Epithelial Permeability
FD-4 diffusion is a good indicator of paracellular permeability.
Therefore, FD-4 transport was measured in this study to evaluate
the protective effect of L. plantarum ZLP001 on epithelial
integrity (Figure 1). FD-4 concentrations in the L. plantarum
ZLP001-treated group were not significantly different from those
in the untreated control. When IPEC-J2 cells were exposed to
106 CFU mL−1 ETEC alone, FD-4 permeation was significantly
increased relative to that of the control group (P < 0.05).
Pretreatment with L. plantarum ZLP001 (108 CFU mL−1
)
significantly counteracted this permeation.

Cells were left untreated or pretreated with L. plantarum ZLP001 (LP,

treatments were examined by RT-qPCR (Figure 2). After IPEC￾J2 cells were incubated with ETEC alone, the mRNA expression
levels of these genes were significantly decreased (P < 0.05)
relative to those in the untreated control. L. plantarum ZLP001
treatment alone had no significant influence on TJ mRNA
expression as compared to the untreated control. L. plantarum
ZLP001 pretreatment significantly (P < 0.05) abrogated the
decreases in TJ-related mRNA expression caused by ETEC
infection.
Differences in TJ protein expression after the bacterial
treatments were examined by western blotting. Expression levels
of claudin-1 (Figure 2D), occludin (Figure 2E), and ZO-1
(Figure 2F) were significantly lower (P < 0.05) in cells exposed
to ETEC than in the untreated controls. These results were
consistent with those for mRNA expression. L. plantarum
ZLP001 treatment alone did not significantly affect protein
expression relative to the untreated control. L. plantarum ZLP001
pretreatment negated the reduction in claudin-1 (Figure 2D) and
ZO-1 (Figure 2F) abundance caused by ETEC treatment.
Effects of L. plantarum ZLP001 on the
Epithelial Immunological Barrier
Proinflammatory cytokines in IPEC-J2 cells were quantified
after the treatments (Figures 3A–C). Incubation with ETEC
alone significantly upregulated IL-6, IL-8, and TNFα transcripts.
Treatment with L. plantarum ZLP001 alone had no significant
effect on cytokine expression. However, pretreatment with
L. plantarum ZLP001 prior to the ETEC challenge reduced
cytokine expression in the IPEC-J2 cells to levels lower than
those observed after ETEC treatment alone (P < 0.05). Therefore,
L. plantarum ZLP001 reduced the ETEC-induced upregulation of
proinflammatory cytokines.

by ELISA. Values are shown as the means ± SE of three independent experiments. ∗P < 0.05 vs. non-treated controls; #P < 0.05 vs. ETEC alone.
ELISA was used to verify the protective effect of L. plantarum
ZLP001 on epithelial immunological function at the protein level
after ETEC challenge (Figures 3D–F). The results confirmed that,
while ETEC did not significantly induced IL-6, L. plantarum
ZLP001 pretreatment suppressed the increases in IL-6, IL-8, and
TNFα secretion in IPEC-J2 cells challenged with ETEC relative to
the levels observed in cells incubated with ETEC alone.
Effects of L. plantarum ZLP001 on HDP
Production
The modulatory effect of L. plantarum ZLP001 on the innate
immune response was evaluated by measuring porcine HDP
mRNA expression (Figures 4A,B). Cathelicidins and β-defensins
are the two main mammalian HDP families. We selected pBD2 (a
β-defensin, Figure 4A) and PG1-5 (a cathelicidin, Figure 4B) as
target genes in this study. The results showed that treatment with
L. plantarum ZLP001 significantly induced mRNA expression of
both HDPs in IPEC-J2 cells (P < 0.05). ETEC exposure had no
significant effect on pBD2 expression, but significantly induced
PG1-5 expression. Challenge with ETEC 3 h after L. plantarum
ZLP001 pretreatment had no significant effect on the HDP
expression levels observed after incubation with L. plantarum
ZLP001 alone.
Effects of bacterial treatment on pBD2 secretion were
evaluated by ELISA (Figure 4C). The result was consistent with

pBD2 mRNA expression. Exposure to L. plantarum ZLP001
significantly induced pBD2 secretion in IPEC-J2 cells. In
contrast, ETEC treatment had no significant effect on pBD2
secretion. Challenge with ETEC 3 h after L. plantarum ZLP001
pretreatment had no significant influence on pBD2 secretion by
L. plantarum ZLP001 treatment alone.
Sequencing Results
Sequencing of the amplified 16S rRNA genes produced 373,846
reads after quality checks. An average of 37,385 ± 4,742
reads were obtained for each sample. Among the high-quality
sequences, >99% were >400 bp. The average read length for each
sample was 435 bp. Reads were clustered into 3,746 OTUs using
a 97% similarity cut-off. We obtained 329–404 OTUs per sample.
Based on rarefaction analysis, the sequencing depth adequately
reflected species richness, suggested that the Illumina MiSeq
sequencing system detected most of the fecal bacterial diversity
in our study.
Effects of L. plantarum ZLP001 on Alpha
Diversity of Fecal Microbiota
We used the Chao1, ACE, Shannon, and Simpson indices
to estimate fecal microbiome taxon abundance and diversity
(Table 1). L. plantarum ZLP001-treated groups exhibited higher
diversity than the control group according to the Shannon and
Simpson indices. Nevertheless, the difference was not significant
(P > 0.05). L. plantarum ZLP001 treatment had no significant
effect on fecal microbiota abundance according to the Chao1
and ACE indices. Good’s coverage was >99.6% for all samples.
Thus, the dominant bacterial phylotypes present in the feces were
captured by this analysis.
Effects of L. plantarum ZLP001 on Fecal
Microbiota Composition
Taxon-dependent analysis was used to compare microbiota
compositions of the feces from piglets treated with L. plantarum
ZLP001 and those receiving the placebo (Figure 5). Firmicutes
and Bacteroidetes were the most abundant phyla in both groups
and accounted for >97% of the total sequences on average.
Firmicutes was the dominant phylum and constituted 58.1% in all
treatments. Bacteroidetes accounted for 39.6%. Other phyla were
present at lower frequencies. Figure 5B shows a hierarchically
clustered heatmap of the fecal microbiota composition at the
genus level. Prevotella was the most abundant; it accounted for an
average of 21.5% of the sequences in all treatments by the end of

the experiment. Clostridium sensu stricto 1 (14.2%) was identified
in the control piglets. Lactobacillus (12.8%) was detected in the
L. plantarum ZLP001-treated piglets. LEfSe analysis indicated no
significant differences between the placebo- and L. plantarum￾treated piglets at the phylum level in terms of relative OTU
abundance. Significant differences were observed between groups
at several other taxa (Figure 6). The probiotic-treated group
was enriched in Bacilli at the class level, Lactobacillales at
the order level, Lactobacillaceae and Ruminococcaceae at the
family level, and Alloprevotella, Anaerotruncus, Faecalibacterium,
Lactobacillus, Subdoligranulum, unclassified Lachnospiraceae,
and no-rank Ruminococcaceae at the genus level. However, it
was depleted in Clostridiaceae_1 and Peptostreptococcaceae at
the family level and Clostridium sensu stricto 1, Terrisporobacter,
Ruminococcaceae_UCG_007, Ruminococcaceae_UCG_004, and
Ruminococcaceae_UCG_009 at the genus level. Fecal microbiota
composition PCoA revealed that L. plantarum ZLP001 treatment
significantly affected overall fecal microbiota composition. The
microbiota communities in the piglets treated with L. plantarum
ZLP001 were clustered together and were distinctly separated
from those of the control pigs (Supplementary Figure S1).
Effects of L. plantarum ZLP001 on Fecal
SCFA Concentrations
Table 2 shows the SCFA concentrations in piglet feces.
L. plantarum ZLP001 treatment increased butyric acid
concentrations relative to those in the controls (P = 0.068).
Acetic and propionic acid concentrations did not significantly
differ between the placebo and L. plantarum ZLP001 treatments
(P > 0.05).
Correlation Between SCFA
Concentrations and Fecal Microbiota
Correlations between SCFA concentration and fecal bacterial
abundance (relative abundance of the top 30 genera) are shown
in Figure 7. The results demonstrated positive associations
between butyric acid concentration and Anaerotruncus
(r = 0.721, P = 0.019) and unclassified_f_Lachnospiraceae
(r = 0.758, P = 0.011) abundance. Acetic acid concentration
was positively correlated with Faecalibacterium (r = 0.879,
P = 0.001), Subdoligranulum (r = 0.721, P = 0.019), and
Prevotellaceae_NK3B31_group (r = 0.648, P = 0.043) abundance.
It was negatively correlated with Clostridium sensu stricto 1
abundance (r = −0.661, P = 0.038). Propionic acid concentration
was negatively correlated with Phascolarctobacterium abundance
(r = −0.697, P = 0.025).
DISCUSSION
Using porcine IPEC-2 cells as a model, we demonstrated
that L. plantarum ZLP001 plays multiple protective roles in
epithelial barrier regulation. The present study showed that
ETEC treatment significantly increased gut permeability to FD-4,
whereas treatment with probiotic L. plantarum ZLP001 alone
had no significant effect on gut permeability. These findings
corroborate those of a previous study, in which probiotic

L. reuteri did not significantly change FD-4 fluorescence intensity
in IPEC-J1 cells (Wang et al., 2016). On the other hand,
L. plantarum ZLP001 pretreatment significantly suppressed the
increase in gut permeability caused by ETEC infection, suggesting
that L. plantarum ZLP001 can alleviate epithelial damage caused
by ETEC. This result was consistent with that of a previous study
in which permeability to FD-4 indicated that L. reuteri treatment
maintains the barrier integrity of IPEC-J1 cells exposed to ETEC
(Wang et al., 2016).
TJ proteins play crucial roles in maintaining barrier integrity
and function. They include transmembrane proteins such as
claudins and occludins, and cytoplasmic scaffolding proteins,
such as the ZO family, which have linking and sealing effects
(Suzuki, 2013). In this study, relative TJ transcript and protein
abundances were significantly reduced after ETEC infection.
However, these reductions were abrogated by pretreatment with
L. plantarum ZLP001. Previous studies using various probiotic
strains reported similar results in vivo and in vitro (Yang
et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2016). Therefore, probiotic L. plantarum
ZLP001 may fortify intestinal epithelial resistance to pathogens
by maintaining TJ protein abundance.
Cytokines play significant regulatory roles in the intestinal
inflammatory response. Several studies have demonstrated the
effects of probiotics on cytokine expression. Nevertheless, this
regulatory action varies with strain. L. reuteri ACTT 6475 shows
immunosuppressive action by inhibiting TNFα overexpression
in LPS-activated human monocytoid THP1 cells (Lin et al.,
2008). However, L. reuteri ACTT 55730 significantly stimulates
TNF-α production as an immunostimulatory action (Jones and
Versalovic, 2009). In the present study, L. plantarum ZLP001
per se did not influence the expression of proinflammatory
cytokines, but inhibited their ETEC-induced overexpression,
thus exerting an immunosuppressive action. Certain pro￾inflammatory cytokines reportedly are associated with pathogen￾induced TJ protein changes (Otte and Podolsky, 2004). ETEC
K88 substantially increases IL-8 and disrupts the membrane
barrier; however, this disruption can be alleviated by L. plantarum
pretreatment (Wu et al., 2016). We obtained similar results in
the present study. ETEC-induced increases in IL-6-, IL-8-, and
TNF-α expression were effectively counteracted by L. plantarum
ZLP001 pretreatment. This observation was consistent with the
FD-4 assay results and TJ protein expression levels. Similar
findings indicated that L. reuteri inhibits TNF-α expression
and may protect TJ proteins (Yang et al., 2015). High￾throughput sequencing analysis of post-weaning piglet feces after
L. plantarum ZLP001 or control treatment revealed relatively low
abundances of certain bacterial genera in the probiotic-treated
group. Some of these are associated with various pathological
conditions, e.g., Peptostreptococcaceae incertae sedi, which is
dominant in viral diarrhea (Ma et al., 2011). Wang et al. (2017)
reported that IL-1β and TNF-α transcript levels were positively
correlated with Clostridium sensu stricto 1 enrichment in the
sheep colon. In the present study, Clostridium sensu stricto 1
was significantly less abundant in the probiotic-treated than
in the control group. Certain Clostridium spp. are harmful to
host health. Epithelial inflammation observed in weaned piglets
may be correlated with Clostridium sensu stricto 1 enrichment
in their intestinal mucosa (Wang et al., 2017). The protective
effect of probiotics in terms of epithelial immunity may be
partially explained by microbiota modulation. One limitation of

the present study was that we did not evaluate proinflammatory
cytokines in the piglet intestinal tissue and thus, we could
not analyze the correlation with microbiota abundance. Such
relationships merit further investigation.
The secretion of HDPs, which exert both antimicrobial and
immunomodulatory activities, is an epithelial innate immunity
mechanism (Bevins et al., 1999; Zhang et al., 2000). Enhancing
endogenous HDP synthesis improves the early response to
bacterial infection and inflammation (Veldhuizen et al., 2008).
Nutrients, such as VD3, butyrate, and zinc induce HDP secretion
(Talukder et al., 2011; Zeng et al., 2013; Merriman et al., 2015).
Probiotics can also stimulate HDP expression (Schlee et al., 2008;
Frontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 10 August 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 1953

Wang et al. Lactobacillus Treatment of Weaned Piglets
FIGURE 8 | Suggested mechanism by which L. plantarum ZLP001 protects intestinal barrier function from weaning stress. L. plantarum ZLP001 functions not only
through maintaining epithelial integrity, improving TJs, regulating the immune response, and stimulating HDPs, but also via modulating the intestinal indigenous
microbiota. Modulated microbiota and alterations in certain bacterial taxa in turn enhance epithelial function.
Liu et al., 2017). In the present study, increased pBD2 and PG1-5
expression and pBD2 secretion were observed after L. plantarum
ZLP001 treatment, suggesting that this strain can induce HDPs,
to protect against bacterial infection. Similar results have been
reported for the probiotic strain L. reuteri I5007 (Liu et al.,
2017). The administration of synthetic HDPs reportedly can
improve weaned piglet growth performance, nutrient digestion
and assimilation, intestinal health, and antioxidant capacity (Xiao
et al., 2013; Yoon et al., 2013; Yu et al., 2017). Therefore, the
induction of HDP expression by L. plantarum ZLP001 may
be correlated with the improved growth and reduced risk of
diarrhea reported in our previous studies. SCFAs, especially
butyrate, induce HDPs (Zeng et al., 2013). Butyrate production
by enteric microbiota is the only microbial stimulus capable
of inducing HDP expression (Schauber et al., 2003). Most
butyrate-producing bacteria belong to Clostridium clusters IV
and XIVa. Butyrate metabolism has been observed in species
of Faecalibacterium and Anaerotruncus, e.g., Faecalibacterium
prausnitzii and Anaerotruncus colihominis are butyrate producers
(El Aidy et al., 2013; Wrzosek et al., 2013). A. colihominis has been
shown to specifically colonize the lumen whereas F. prausnitzii
is enriched in the mucus (Van den Abbeele et al., 2013). In
the present study, Faecalibacterium spp. and Anaerotruncus spp.
were significantly abundant in L. plantarum ZLP001-treated
piglets. Therefore, increasing the abundances of these genera
may elevate butyrate levels and epithelial HDP expression.
The present study confirmed a positive correlation between
fecal butyric acid and Anaerotruncus spp. abundance after
L. plantarum ZLP001 treatment. In addition, Faecalibacterium
spp. abundance showed a positive correlation with acetic acid
concentration. Acetic acid can be converted to butyrate by
Eubacterium rectale (Duncan and Flint, 2008), which may
enhance HDP expression. The modulation of butyrate producers
with probiotics to generate butyrate to stimulate HDP levels in
the epithelium may thus be a meaningful approach for future
interventions that aim to improve intestinal balance. Few studies
have focused on the association between HDP production and
probiotic function. Future studies involving probiotical and
the non-pathogenic enteric bacterial regulation of antimicrobial
peptides may elucidate the beneficial effects of probiotics against
pathogen infection.
The piglet intestinal microbiota undergoes substantial
dynamic changes after weaning, and this alteration can be
associated with severe disorders and bowel disease. In the present
study, fecal bacterial communities were dominated by Firmicutes
and Bacteroidetes, regardless of treatment. This result was
expected because the colon is a strictly anaerobic environment
and most of the species within these phyla are anaerobic. Similar
results were reported in previous pig studies (Konstantinov
et al., 2004; Kim and Isaacson, 2015). Prevotella, which is
associated with hemicelluloses degradation, reportedly is the
predominant genus in piglets at nursery stage (Konstantinov
et al., 2004). A high Prevotella spp. abundance may be essential
for post-weaning piglets to be able to digest plant-based diets.
Post-weaning increases in the proportions of Lactobacillus spp.
are desirable and beneficial. Previous studies have shown that

Wang et al. Lactobacillus Treatment of Weaned Piglets
oral administration of lactic acid bacteria enhances the relative
abundance of intestinal Lactobacillus spp. in weaned piglets (Hu
et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2016). In the present study, dietary
L. plantarum ZLP001 supplementation significantly increased
Lactobacillus spp. abundance in the post-weaning piglet intestine.
L. plantarum ZLP001 may produce molecules that stimulate
Lactobacillus spp. growth in the piglet intestine (Ohashi et al.,
2001). Alternatively, the observed increase in Lactobacillus
abundance may have resulted from the proliferation of the
administered probiotic strain (Takahashi et al., 2007). Certain
lactobacilli, such as L. rhamnosus, L. reuteri, and L. plantarum,
protect TJ proteins after stress and infection and may, therefore,
contribute to TJ integrity and intestinal barrier function (Yang
et al., 2015; Blackwood et al., 2017). Further studies are needed
to investigate specific species and their effects on piglet epithelial
TJ proteins. The effects on gut microbiota composition and
community observed after L. plantarum ZLP001 treatment in
this study suggest that the modulation of the intestinal flora
by L. plantarum ZLP001 helps to maintain a well-balanced gut
microbiota, thereby improving the health and growth of pigs.
CONCLUSION
Our IPEC-J2 model demonstrated that L. plantarum ZLP001
enhances intestinal barrier function by (1) maintaining epithelial
integrity and preventing ETEC-induced gut permeability, (2)
forming TJs and reducing ETEC-induced TJ damage, (3)
modulating immune function and repressing the ETEC-induced
immune response, and (4) inducing the secretion of antimicrobial
peptides to protect against pathogens. Our study also indicated
that L. plantarum ZLP001 supplementation improved gut
bacterial ecology and barrier function in weaned piglets by (1)
reducing the abundance of certain bacterial species correlated
with proinflammatory cytokine expression, (2) modulating
butyrate-producing enteric microbiota to induce epithelial HDP
expression, and (3) enhancing intestinal Lactobacillus abundance
to improve the gut microbiota composition and reinforce TJs
(Figure 8). Elucidation of the mechanisms by which probiotics
act on the intestinal barrier will promote their use in livestock
production. In addition, further animal studies are required to
determine how L. plantarum ZLP001 protects the piglet intestinal
barrier both before and after pathogenesis.
