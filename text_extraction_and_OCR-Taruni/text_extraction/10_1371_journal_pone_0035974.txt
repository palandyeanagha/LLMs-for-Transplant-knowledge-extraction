Abstract
Genomes of hepatitis E virus (HEV), rubivirus and cutthroat virus (CTV) contain a region of high proline density and low
amino acid (aa) complexity, named the polyproline region (PPR). In HEV genotypes 1, 3 and 4, it is the only region within the
non-structural open reading frame (ORF1) with positive selection (4–10 codons with dN/dS.1). This region has the highest
density of sites with homoplasy values .0.5. Genotypes 3 and 4 show ,3-fold increase in homoplastic density (HD) in the
PPR compared to any other region in ORF1, genotype 1 does not exhibit significant HD (p,0.0001). PPR sequence
divergence was found to be 2-fold greater for HEV genotypes 3 and 4 than for genotype 1. The data suggest the PPR plays
an important role in host-range adaptation. Although the PPR appears to be hypervariable and homoplastic, it retains as
much phylogenetic signal as any other similar sized region in the ORF1, indicating that convergent evolution operates
within the major HEV phylogenetic lineages. Analyses of sequence-based secondary structure and the tertiary structure
identify PPR as an intrinsically disordered region (IDR), implicating its role in regulation of replication. The identified
propensity for the disorder-to-order state transitions indicates the PPR is involved in protein-protein interactions.
Furthermore, the PPR of all four HEV genotypes contains seven putative linear binding motifs for ligands involved in the
regulation of a wide number of cellular signaling processes. Structure-based analysis of possible molecular functions of
these motifs showed the PPR is prone to bind a wide variety of ligands. Collectively, these data suggest a role for the PPR in
HEV adaptation. Particularly as an IDR, the PPR likely contributes to fine tuning of viral replication through protein-protein
interactions and should be considered as a target for development of novel anti-viral drugs.

Introduction
Hepatitis E virus (HEV), a hepevirus [1], causes epidemic and
sporadic cases of hepatitis in humans [2]. Initially, HEV infection
and hepatitis E were encountered primarily in developing
countries, and in developed countries were recognized as
associated with international travel. However, as detection
techniques have improved, HEV infection has been found to be
more prevalent than originally thought and is currently found
worldwide [3]. HEV sequences are segregated into four genotypes.
HEV genotypes 1 and 2 infect primarily humans along the fecal/
oral transmission route, while genotypes 3 and 4 can infect
humans, swine, deer and boar. In humans, infection by genotypes
3 and 4 appears to be primarily zoonotic [4,5]. The epidemiology
of HEV infections is complex and the virus can be transmitted
through multiple modes [6].
The HEV genome is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA of
about 7.2 kb with a 59-methylguanine cap and 39-poly(A) tail. The
genome contains three overlapping open reading frames (ORFs).
ORF1 encodes the non-structural proteins responsible for viral
replication. ORF2 encodes the viral capsid protein, and ORF3
encodes a protein, which has regulatory functions [1]. The ORF1
non-structural proteins share the highest homology with a group of
viruses called rubi-like viruses which includes Rubivirus, Betate￾travirus, Benyvirus, Omegatetravirus, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum debili￾tation-associated virus and cutthroat trout virus (CTV) [7,8,9].
Sequence divergence among HEV isolates is highest in a region
preceding the helicase in the nonstructural polyprotein [10]. This
region contains a disproportionate number of prolines as
compared with the rest of the nonstructural polyprotein and is
known as the polyproline region (PPR). Because of sequence
variability the region is also known as the hypervariable region
[11,12]. The Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (INRA),
home of the Pfam database, states that the PPR belongs to protein
family 12526 (DUF3729, CDD:152960) [13]. This protein is of
unknown function and is found in association with several proteins
including pfam 01660 (viral methyltransferase), pfam 05417
(protease C41), pfam 01661 (Appr-10-p processing enzyme/macro
domain) [14], pfam 01443 (UvrD/REP helicase) and pfam 00978
(RNA-dependent RNA polymerase). The HEV PPR was first
reported by Koonin et al. [10] as a putative protein hinge. Proteins
and peptides with stretches of multiple prolines may not have
stable tertiary structure [15,16,17], which is consistent with the
PPR acting as a hinge. However, the functions of the HEV PPR, if
any, are unknown. The PPR does not appear to be required for
the replication of rubivirus [18] or HEV [12]. Immediately
upstream from the PPR is a region with no known function [10].
Tzeng et al. showed that a deletion of this region and part of the
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 April 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 4 | e35974

PPR created a rubivirus mutant that was unable to self-replicate
[18]. However, Pudupakam et al. found that deletions in the PPR
did not abolish HEV infectivity in vivo or in vitro, although near￾complete deletion of the PPR yielded evidence of attenuation [12]
and suggested that the PPR may interact with viral and host
factors to modulate replication efficiency [19]. This paper presents
data indicating a role of the PPR in HEV adaptation.
Materials and Methods
The sequences used in this study were obtained from GenBank
(Table S1).
Sequence Alignment
HEV genotype 1 to 4 sequences were initially aligned with
ClustalX (ver. 2) [20]. Peptides from the HEV PPR for genotypes
1, 3 and 4 were individually realigned using MUSCLE (ver. 3.6)
[21].
Identification of the PPR
To identify the PPR in sequences used in this study, a small Perl
(Strawberry Perl 5.12.1.0) script was written to scan the viral
genomes and determine the number of prolines within a 30-
residue window and a step of one residue. A value of 9 prolines in
a window was chosen as the cutoff for a PPR (cutoff was 8 for
genotype 2).
Shannon entropy
Shannon entropy was calculated for each position in an
alignment of amino acid (aa) sequences using BioEdit (ver.
7.0.5.3) [22]. Because of the per residue variation, the average
entropy for a sliding window of 30 residues with a one-residue step
was used to smooth the data for this analysis.
Selective pressure
Selective pressure was calculated as dN/dS using the one-rate
fixed effects likelihood method in HyPhy (ver. 2.0020101222beta)
with a p,0.05 considered statistically significant [23].
Homoplastic density
The homoplasy index was calculated using PAUP*(ver.
4.10beta) with the apolist command [24]. The homoplastic density
was obtained by counting the number of homoplastic sites with
values .0.5 within a 50-nucleotide (nt) sliding window with a one￾base step.
Intrinsically disordered region prediction
Intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) in individual sequences
were predicted using the DISOPRED2 server [25] at its default
settings. This method was chosen because it is conservative in its
estimations of disorder. DISOPRED2 is based on a database of
high-resolution crystallographic information (#2 A˚ ). A sequence
query is aligned to similar regions from Protein Data Bank (PDB:
www.pdb.org) for which no coordinate information is available, as
disordered regions cannot be modeled through crystallography.
These results were confirmed using IUPred by screening for long
disordered regions [26]. IUPRED is based on the computation of
pair-wise interaction energies of residues in the query sequences to
estimate their tendency to form stabilizing pair-wise interactions
[27].
Linear Motifs
Functional sites in the PPR conforming to the constraints of
linear motifs (LMs) [28,29] were predicted using the Eukaryote
linear motif (ELM) server at elm.eu.org [30]. LMs were predicted
for each genotype (genotypes 1–4) and the Japanese wild boar
sequences [31], and compared to identify motifs found in all
sequences. Only LMs that were found to be common to all the
sequences were considered to be putative HEV LMs. For example,
the LIG_CYCLIN_1 site was discarded from this analysis because
a required MOD_CDK motif was found only in genotype 3
sequences.
Tree comparison
Continuous non-overlapping windows in HEV genotypes 1, 3
and 4 were created using the length of the polyproline region for
each genotype as the window size. The windows for each genotype
were situated so that one of the windows would be the polyproline
region itself. Neighbor-joining trees were created for aligned full￾length ORF1 sequences and each of the window regions with
DNADIST, using the Kimura 2-parameter substitution model,
and NEIGHBOR [32]. The tree for each window region was
compared to the full-length ORF1 tree with the nodal and split
distance methods in TPOD/FMTS (ver. 3.3) [33].
3-Dimensional (3D) Structure
Analysis was conducted using the PPR of the HEV genotype 3
sequence with GenBank accession number AB091394. The PPR
was 81 residues long located between protein positions 707–831
(according to reference M74506).
Ten full-atomic ab-initio-based 3D models of the HEV genotype
3 PPR were automatically generated using the I-TASSER
software package (ver. 1.1) [34,35]. Briefly, to excise continuous
fragments from template alignments, 5 threading programs were
sequentially implemented against the PDB to select the best
templates matching the query sequence. Template selection by
each method was restricted to 20 matches. Assembly of the
continuous fragments was performed by running 14 Monte Carlo
simulations. Full-atomic 3D models were generated after energy
minimization refinements of assembled structures. Accuracy of
predicted models was evaluated by confidence scores (C-scores).
The C-score is a confidence score for estimating the quality of
predicted models. This score is typically in the range of [25, 2],
where a high value signifies a model with a high confidence and
vice-versa. A TM-score .0.5 indicates a model of correct topology
and a TM-score ,0.17 means a random similarity. A full detail of
implemented protocols is available in [34].
Molecular analysis described herein was performed using the
top-ranked 3D model. To assess the overall stereochemical quality
of the generated 3D model, the geometrical accuracy of the
residues and 3D profile quality index were inspected with the
PROCHECK (ver. 3.5) [36] and VADAR (ver. 1.8) [37]
programs, respectively. Additional refinement to remove atomic
clashes was carried out using the WHATIF (ver. 8.0) modeling
package software [38].
Secondary Structure
The sequence-based prediction of the secondary structure of the
HEV PPR, was performed using PSIPRED (ver. 2.6) [39].
Secondary structure assignment in the PPR was done using the
standard DSSP method [40].

Accessible Molecular Surface
To assess the exposed surface area, the accessible surface area
(ASA) or the area where a water molecule could access or contact,
the accessible molecular surface of residues in the PPR model was
calculated. The ASA for each residue was computed and
measured in square Angstroms (A˚ ) as implemented in the
WHATIF modeling package software [38].
Electrostatic Surface
Simulation of atomic-scale information on energetic contribu￾tions to atomic interactions and biomolecular structure of the
HEV PPR 3D model was performed to examine possible
biomolecular functions and highlight regions of potential interest.
Electrostatic properties were evaluated via an implicit method for
modeling biomolecular solvation through solution of the Poisson￾Boltzmann (PB) equation. The electrostatic potentials around the
PPR molecule were calculated with APBS (ver. 1.2) [41] and
visualized with PyMOL (ver. 1.1r2pre) [42].
Structure-based function predictions
To associate possible molecular functions to the PPR 3D model,
gene ontology (GO) terms were derived using a structure-based
method for annotation of biological function. The 3D model was
threaded against a set of function libraries by global and local
structure matches. GO terms were then derived from the best
functional homology templates (TM score cutoff .0.5). A total of
ten matches were extracted and ranked by their TM-score [34,35].
GO terms associated with each of these functional PDB template
analogs were compiled and the consensus GO terms among them
was used to predict molecular functions in the PPR. Analysis was
conducted using the COFACTOR algorithm [43,44].
Protein binding regions in IDRs
Disordered protein segments can function as linkers between
globular domains because of their flexibility [45]. Additionally,
disordered regions in proteins can have important functional roles
by binding specifically to other proteins, DNA or RNA ligands.
These binding interactions, known as coupled folding and binding,
involve transient disorder-to-order state transitions with more
stable secondary and tertiary structural elements [46,47]. Studies
have shown that disordered regions with the properties to be
involved in coupled folding and binding can be distinguished from
those that lack them [48,49,50,51].
The PPR IDR was examined to determine its ability to undergo
coupled folding and binding using an algorithm to identify protein
binding regions. Predictions were carried out using the ANCHOR
program (ver. 1.0) [52,53]. Briefly, prediction of protein binding
regions was done from the aa sequence of PPR (ref. AB091394).
Recognition of binding regions was based on the properties of
residues located in the IDR to energetically gain favorable intra￾chain interactions to form a stable secondary structure by
interacting with a protein partner. Estimation of residue properties
relied on the energy estimation framework implemented for
disorder predictions in IUPRED [27]. To decrease the false￾positive rate on globular domains and transmembrane segments,
short regions ,6 residues and regions with an average IUPRED
score (disorder tendency of a residue) ,0.1 were filtered out.
Results
Proline distribution within the ORF1-protein
The ORF1-encoded proteins of hepeviruses were examined
using a Perl script to count the number of Pro residues within a 30-
aa sliding window. Analysis identified protein regions with the
highest Pro density across this family of viruses (Table 1). An
alignment of HEV genotype 1–4 sequences showed that the PPR
was bound by conserved sequences TLYTRTWS and
RRLLXTYPDG at the N- and C-sides, respectively. HEV
isolated from avians and rats were also found to have PPR, but
did not have the conserved sequence boundaries found in
genotypes 1–4. Sequence conservation of PPR boundaries could
not be established with certainty because of the limited number of
extant sequences. Similar to genotypes 1–4, the PPR in the avian
and rat sequences was located upstream from the putative macro
domain as shown earlier [14].
Sequence diversity
Shannon entropy analysis using a 30-aa sliding window showed
that the PPR in human and avian HEV represents the most
divergent protein region (Fig. 1). The PPR sequence divergence is
.2-fold greater for HEV zoonotic genotypes 3 and 4 than for
human genotype 1, suggesting the potential association between
sequence heterogeneity and the number of hosts.
Selection
An examination of selective pressure along ORF1 was
conducted using calculation of dN/dS values for each codon. It
was found that ORF1 is in general under strong negative selection.
There are no dN/dS values with $1 anywhere in ORF1 except for
the region encoding for the PPR. The PPR from genotypes 1, 3
and 4 contains 4–10 codons with dN/dS.1, indicating that the
PPR is the only genomic region in these genotypes that has
experienced detectable positive selection (Fig. 2).
Homoplastic density
The PPR has the highest density of sites with homoplasy index
values .0.5 (Fig. 3). Genotypes 3 and 4 show ,3-fold increase in
density of strongly homoplastic sites (HD) in the PPR compared to
any other region in ORF1 whereas genotype 1 does not exhibit
significant HD (p,0.0001) (Fig. 3). In general, the genotype 3 and
4 ORF1 has a ,2-fold greater HD than genotype 1. The genotype
1 sequence database contains only 17 sequences, whereas the
genotype 3 and 4 databases contain 74 and 55 sequences,
respectively. To eliminate the possibility that the observation of a
lower HD in genotype 1 is related to a small number of sequences
available, 17 sequences were selected at random for genotypes 3
and 4. However, analysis of the lower number of sequences still
yielded high HD in the PPR (data not shown). Additional analysis
was conducted using only the genotype 3b sequences alone
(n = 20). The genotype 3b PPR shows a high HD, but is 30%
lower than seen with all genotype 3 or 4 sequences (data not
shown). The data suggest that the higher HD in genotypes 3 and 4
result from a greater sequence divergence as compared to
genotype 1, possibly reflecting the more diverse host range for
genotypes 3 and 4.
The intrinsically disordered region
Many polyproline regions are known to be unstructured or
disordered [54]. To examine whether the HEV PPR belongs to
this class of IDRs, 2 algorithms were used in this analysis. The
HEV genotype 1, 3 and 4 PPRs were predicted to be IDRs located
between conserved sequences TLYTRTWS and RRLLXT
YPDG. Genotype 2 was also predicted to have an IDR, located
between these conserved sequences, which, however, does not
coincide with the region of the highest Pro density as was observed
for genotypes 1, 3 and 4 (Table 1). This table also shows that the

putative genotype 2 PPR has the lowest probability of being an
IDR and the lowest number of prolines.
The PPRs in avian and rat HEV located upstream from the
putative macro domain were also predicted to be IDRs (Fig. 4).
Taking into consideration that the predicted genotype 1–4 IDRs
are flanked by or located near conserved regions, the conserved
IDR boundaries may be located between aa positions 533 and 618
(AY535004), and 570 and 678 (GU345042) of the ORF1-encoded
polyprotein for avian and rat HEV, respectively. An alignment of
CDD:152960 sequences at NCBI [55] suggests that the conserved
aa sequences KLLTLKELA and EEVLALLP [13] in avian HEV
serve as the N- and C-terminal IDR boundaries.
The PPRs from genotypes 1, 3 and 4, and avian HEV contain a
low fraction of Ile, Met, Phe, Trp and Tyr and a high fraction of
Ala, Gly, Pro and Ser (Fig. 5), which is consistent with a low aa
complexity of known IDRs. IDRs usually have a low proportion of
bulky hydrophobic aa, a high proportion of polar and charged aa
[45] and structure breaking aa, like Pro and Gly [27].
Duplications of sequence have been found within some IDRs
[15,54]. An examination of genotype 3 PPR sequences revealed
that some genotype 3f sequences contain a 27-aa, head-to-tail
duplication (Fig. 6) near the C- terminus of the PPR. Further
examination showed that some genotype 3e sequences contain a
potentially more complex indel pattern, which results in a 13-aa
insertion in this region and some genotype 3a sequences have a 4-
to 6-residue insertion in this region dominated by Pro (Fig. 6).
PPR of rubi-like viruses
Homology between HEV and rubivirus non-structural genes
suggests that HEV belongs to a group of animal, plant and mycotic
viruses known as the rubi-like viruses [7]. Besides hepeviruses, only
rubiviruses and CTV contain a PPR located upstream from the
macro domain (Table 1). The rubivirus PPR also has high genetic
diversity (Fig. 1) and sites under positive selection (Fig. 2).
However, similar to genotype 1, the rubivirus PPR as well as the
entire non-structural polyprotein has a very low HD (Fig. 3). CTV
could not be tested for these properties as there is only one full￾length sequence extant [9]. Like the hepeviruses, rubiviruses and
CTV exhibits high disorder probability in its PPR (Fig. 4). The
rubivirus PPR also has a low aa complexity (Fig. 5).
Phylogenetic fidelity
The detection of considerable homoplasy and high genetic
diversity in the PPR, as compared to other regions in the ORF1,
suggests that there should be a substantial decline in homology
among HEV sequences in the PPR, particularly for genotypes 3
Figure 2. dN/dS values for rubivirus and HEV. For genotypes 1, 3 and 4, and rubivirus, results of analysis are shown across from aa positions 701
to 800, which includes the PPR IDR region. Values .1 represent positions under positive selection. Insert shows dN/dS values for the PPR IDR of avian
HEV (528 to 614 aa). There are no dN/dS values $1 in ORF1 outside the regions shown.

and 4 sequences. This decline should be reflected in distortion of
phylogenetic relationships among different sequences in the PPR.
However, such a suggestion contrasts to the successful use of
phylogenetic trees to genotype HEV isolates using this region
[56,57,58,59]. To determine whether the PPR phylogenetic signal
is reduced when compared to other ORF1-regions, the TOPD/
FMTS program [33] was used to examine concordance of
phylogenetic trees generated using a sliding window across the
ORF1. The phylogenetic signal for the tree from each window was
compared to a tree for the entire ORF1. Using the nodal distance
method, the PPR was found to have about the same phylogenetic
signal as any other region when compared to the complete ORF1
tree (Fig. 7).
Linear Motifs
Linear motifs (LMs) are short peptide segments that do not
require 3D organization in order to function. These motifs operate
as sites of regulation and are found in IDRs [28,29]. Accordingly,
the HEV PPR was examined for the occurrence of LMs. Using the
search engine at elm.eu.org, seven LMs were found to be common
across all four HEV genotypes and in HEV sequences from
Japanese wild boars (Table 2). These sites, which are all in the
IDR, included two protease cleavage sites (CLV_NDR_NDR_1
and CLV_PCSK_SKI1_1), three ligand binding sites (LIG_EH_1,
LIG_EVH1_1 and LIG_SH2_STAT5) and two kinase phosphor￾ylation sites (MOD_PKA_2 and MOD_PLK).
Protein binding region in the HEV genotype 3 PPR
The ANCHOR algorithm was used to show that the 52-aa
region in the PPR (AB091394) between aa positions 707–758 (ref.
M74506) is prone to transient disorder-to-order transitions upon
binding to a protein ligand. The highest probability scores ($0.74)
were observed for subregions 707-TSGFSSDFS-715 and 737-
VSDIWVLPP-745 (Fig. 8D). Four of the LMs were found to be
located within these subregions, namely, kinase phosphorylation
sites (MOD_CK1_1, 708-SGFSSDF-714 and MOD_GSK3_1,
708-SGFSSDFS-715), glycosaminoglycan attachment site
(MOD_GlcNHglycan, 707-TSGF-710), and ligand binding site
(LIG_SH3_3, 739-DIWVLPP-745).
3D-model of the HEV genotype 3 PPR
To examine further the structural properties of the PPR and
investigate its possible molecular functional roles, we predicted the
3D molecular structure of the HEV PPR. The top-ranked 3D￾model generated by I-TASSER [34,35] yielded a C￾score = 22.71, an estimated accuracy of 0.460.14 (TM-score)
and an estimated resolution of 9.464.6 A˚ . Identification of 98.1%
of residues falling within favorable and allowed regions of the
Ramachandran plots and analysis of the 3D-profile indexes (Fig.
S1 and S2) indicate a good stereochemical quality of the 3D-model
(Fig. 8E). Lack of regular strand and helix secondary structure was
observed in the PPR model generated by the DSSP secondary
structure assignment [40]. Based on PSIPRED’s 3-state, secondary
structure prediction for this region, all residues were identified as

0.05 was set to distinguish between ordered and disordered region along the genome (dashed line). Regions above the threshold are predicted to be
disordered (see table 1). All these viruses have a peak above 0.05 within their respective PPRs, positions 570 to 800. Rubivirus has two peaks, one in
the PPR and the second at about position 1000, which is just upstream of the endopeptidase (denoted by the asterisk).

random coil (Fig. S3). Also shown in Fig. 8 are aa physicochemical
properties mapped onto the 3D model, which reveal the PPR’s
high composition of flexible and hydrophilic polar residues. These
findings provide evidence that this PPR is intrinsically disordered.
Surface and electrostatic properties
Approximately 70% of the residues in the PPR 3D-model were
observed to be exposed (surface accessibility $15 A˚ 2
; Fig. 8G).
Mapping of the computed electrostatic potentials onto the surface
showed that the PPR surface is mainly negatively charged (Fig. 8E).
Two major regions (surface patches) of high negative polarity
(indicated by color density in Fig. 8E) were identified on the
surface of PPR. The electrostatic potential properties at these two
sites suggest that the PPR may be involved in protein-protein
interactions [60].
Prediction of molecular functions
COFACTOR was used to identify putative molecular functions
of the PPR based on the predicted 3D structure by using GO
annotations [43,44]. The best PDB structural analogs of the PPR
and the consensus GO annotations associated to them are shown
in Table 3. Binding interactions were found to be the major
molecular functional role among the top six functions attributed to
the PPR, of which protein-protein interaction was one of such
roles (GO:0005515; in Table 4). These results suggest that, similar
to other IDRs [45], the PPR may be involved in binding of a wide
variety of substrates.
Discussion
The functional significance of the HEV PPR remains unknown.
The data obtained in the present study suggest that the substantial
sequence variability of PPR plays an important role in viral
adaptation. Although the exact role of the PPR in HEV
adaptation is not known, several findings indicate that the PPR
may be involved in determination of host range. The HEV
lineages of genotypes 1 and 2 are anthropotropic, while the
genotype 3 and 4 HEV strains infect not only humans but also
several animal species [5], suggesting their zoonotic origin.
Consistent with the broad host range of zoonotic HEV lineages,
PPR in HEV genotypes 3 and 4 is ,2-fold more heterogeneous
than in HEV genotype 1 (Fig. 1). The limited number of available
sequences did not allow for assessing the degree of PPR
heterogeneity in genotype 2.
Analysis of distribution of highly homoplastic sites along ORF1
was especially informative (Fig. 3). It was found that the PPR had
the 3-fold greater HD than any other region within ORF1 of HEV
genotypes 3 and 4, although no difference in HD was observed
along ORF1 in genotype 1. Moreover, Shannon entropy in ORF1
from genotypes 3 and 4 was .2 times greater than in genotype 1
in the PPR (Fig. 1). The presence of many highly homoplastic sites
indicates the operation of recurrent selection pressures on ORF1
and especially the PPR in the zoonotic genotypes 3 and 4. This
finding suggests convergent evolution of the PPR, which is
probably related to shuttling HEV infection among various
susceptible species of hosts.
The PPR is the only region in ORF1 that contains sites under
positive selection (Fig. 2). All 3 HEV genotypes, for which the
sufficient number of sequences was available for analysis, contain
4–10 codons with dN/dS.1. Since both anthropotropic and
zoonotic genotypes experienced detectable positive selection, the
PPR is not only involved in adaptation to the host range but
expresses other adaptive traits shared by all genotypes.
The PPR also has a low content of bulky hydrophobic aas (Ile,
Met, Phe, Trp and Tyr) and a high proportion of polar and
charged aas (Ala, Gly, Pro and Ser) (Fig. 5) [27,45]. The fractional

content of aa in the PPR is maintained across all four HEV
genotypes (Fig. 7). The confluence of findings showing high Pro
density, high average Shannon entropy (Fig. 1), positive selection
(Fig. 2) and reduction in ordered secondary structure (Fig. 4)
strongly suggests that the HEV PPR is an IDR. Analysis carried
out on the PPR 3D-model for HEV genotype 3 also confirmed
that the PPR lacks regular structure, is highly polarized, negatively
charged, largely solvent accessible and flexible, all characteristics
of IDRs (Fig. 8) [29,60]. All HEV sequences studied have this
IDR, including sequences from avians and rats. As HEV belongs
to rubi-like viruses, other members of this family were tested for
IDR; only rubivirus and CTV have a region of high polyproline
density. Rubivirus possesses two IDR-like domains: one domain
associated with its PPR and the other domain located between the
macro domain and the endopeptidase (pfam05407) (Fig. 2). It
should be noted that the latter domain in rubivirus does not have
the high Pro density or positive dN/dS. Thus, the PPR is the only
region under positive selection in HEV, rubivirus and CTV
(Fig. 2).
Positive selection and high homoplastic density in the PPR of
HEV genotype 3 and 4 should lead to a highly diverse population
of sequences within the PPR. Indeed, the PPR has a high degree of
divergence (Fig. 3) and accordingly, has been called the
hypervariable region [11]. All these factors taken together with
reduction in aa composition complexity should substantially
scramble phylogenetic relationships of the PPR from different
HEV strains because of the small contribution of many sites to
homology in this region. However, an examination of the PPR
shows that it has approximately the same degree of phylogenetic
signal as seen in most other regions of similar size in ORF1 (Fig. 6).
Application of this region to phylogenetic analysis of HEV
genotypes and subtypes seems to be as accurate as the use of
any other genomic regions [56,57,58,59]. This observation
indicates that the observed homoplasy and positive selection are
specific to HEV genotypes and subtypes, and occur within the
boundaries of the major HEV lineages. Thus, both homoplasy and
positive selection most probably reflect recurrent adaptation events
experienced by each HEV lineage and are specific to these
lineages. These considerations explain the reduced contribution of

these factors to the phylogenetic noise at the level of genotypes and
subgenotypes.
The PPR does not appear to be required for the replication of
rubivirus [18] or HEV [12,19,61]. Immediately upstream from the
PPR is a region with no known function [10]. Tzeng et al. [18]
showed that a deletion of this region in rubella virus created a
mutant that was unable to replicate. However, Pudupakam et al.
[12,19] found that deletions in the PPR did not abolish infectivity
of HEV in vivo or in vitro, although near-complete deletion of the
PPR yielded evidence of attenuation. Moreover, Nguyen et al. [61]
isolated naturally occurring variants isolated in serum and feces
from a patient chronically infected with HEV that had deletions in
the PPR and macro domain. These observations suggest that the
PPR plays a regulatory role in HEV replication, which may be
related to proper positioning of structured protein domains
[15,16]. The folding of such hinges is known to regulate the self￾assembly of large multiprotein complexes [45] and the PPR may
interact with viral and host factors [19].
The recently observed association between deletions in the PPR
and variation in levels of viral RNA replication is consistent with
the PPR being able to modulate the rate of HEV replication [12].
Ropp et al. observed that after extended incubations of 24–
36 hours, the HEV ORF1 polyprotein, expressed as a vaccinia
recombinant, was cleaved to yield two products in vivo [62].
Mutagenesis of Cys in the active site of the putative HEV papain￾like protease failed to abolish cleavage, indicating that this protease
is not involved in the observed ORF1-protein processing.
However, Koonin et al. had noted earlier that the papain-like
protease motifs found in HEV were atypical [10], which may also
explain the result of the mutagenesis experiment. The location of
the potential cleavage site [62] appears to be situated near the two
putative LM protease cleavage sites identified here (Table 2). This
finding may explain, at least in part, the results reported by
Pudupakam et al. [12,19].
Sequence analyses of the ORF1 of all HEV genotypes identified
the PPR as an IDR (Fig. 4). The identified propensity of the HEV
PPR for the disorder-to-order transitions upon interaction with a
protein ligand (Fig. 8D) is an important IDR property. The PPR
region capable of such transitions is most negatively charged
(Fig. 8E) and most prone to protein-ligand binding. As an IDR, the
PPR may be involved in regulating viral transcription and
translation [45]. IDRs are known to affect protein folding and to
bind to large numbers of proteins due to the intrinsically
disordered nature of these regions [15,16]. An examination of
LMs found seven putative linear motifs located within the IDR.
These include two protease-cleavage sites, three ligand binding
sites and two kinase phosphorylation sites (Table 2).
Additionally, the PPR 3D-model was used to predict the
occurrence of molecular functional roles using GO annotations.
This analysis revealed several sites potentially involved in
interactions with many protein ligands (Tables 2 and 4). The
motifs include putative peptide cleavage sites, sites modified by
enzymes and sites that bind to proteins, nucleotides and metal
ions. Such interactions have been shown to contribute to
regulation of cellular signal transduction, protein phosphorylation
as well as transcription and translation [45]. Thus, these findings
suggest that the PPR is involved in protein-protein interactions
associated with the regulation of HEV replication. Of further
interest are recent reports of isolations of virus/host recombinants
found in patients chronically infected with HEV [61,63]. In both
instances a fragment from a human ribosomal protein was inserted
in-frame into the PPR, in the first case as a 174-nt (58-aa) insertion
from S17 [63] and in the second a 117-nt (39-aa) insertion from
S19 [61]. The finding of these insertions provides an additional
support to the hypothesis that the PPR has regulatory functions
essential for viral adaptation rather than functions critical for viral
replication.
In conclusion, the data shown here strongly suggest the role of
the PPR in HEV adaptation, including the host-specific adapta￾tion. Being an IDR, the PPR is likely involved in fine tuning of
viral replication through protein-protein interactions. Delineation
of these interactions will lead to a better understanding of the
HEV life cycle and to development of novel anti-viral drugs.
