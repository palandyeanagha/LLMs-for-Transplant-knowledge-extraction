A B S T R A C T The plasma disappearance rate (meta￾bolic clearance rate) of administered intact parathyroid
hormone (intact PTH) was analyzed in awake dogs
with indwelling hepatic and renal vein catheters. The
metabolic clearance rate (MCR) of intact PTH was
found to be very rapid, 21.6±3.1 ml/min per kg in 11
normal dogs. The liver accounted for the greatest frac￾tion of the MCR of intact PTH (61±4%) by virtue of an
arterial minus venous (a - v) difference across the liver of
45±3%. The renal uptake of intact PTH accounted for
31±3% of the MCR of intact PTH. The renal a - v dif￾ference for intact PTH of 29±2% was significantly
greater than the filtration fraction indicating renal up￾take of intact PTH at sites independent of glomerular
filtration. Together, the hepatic and renal clearances
of intact PTH accounted for all but a small fraction of
the MCR of intact PTH. The MCR of intact PTH, ren￾dered biologically inactive by oxidation, was markedly
decreased to 8.8±1 ml/min per kg. The a - v difference
of oxidized intact PTH was reduced both in the liver
and kidney. These data suggested that the high uptake
rates of intact PTH are dependent, at least in part, upon
sites recognizing only biologically active PTH.
Chronic renal failure (CRF) decreased the MCR of
intact PTH to 11.3±1.3 ml/min per kg (n = 10). Both the
hepatic and renal a - v differences of intact PTH were
reduced in dogs with CRF. This resulted in reductions
in the hepatic and renal clearances ofintact PTH. These
studies identify the liver as a major extrarenal site of
PTH metabolism affected by CRF. They suggest that

CRF impairs the function of the major uptake sites
involved in intact PTH metabolism.
INTRODUCTION
In recent years, our knowledge of the peripheral
metabolism of parathyroid hormone (PTH)l has been
greatly enhanced. Circulating PTH has been shown
to be a heterogenous mixture of intact hormone (PTH
1-84) and hormone fragments (1-7). In addition,
work by several authors (3, 8-11) has demonstrated
different specificities among the target organs for the
form of PTH that each organ removes from the cir￾culation. For instance, several authors have demon￾strated that intact PTH is removed from the circula￾tion by the liver (3, 4, 8, 9). A previous report from
our laboratory suggested that hepatic uptake of PTH
is specific for intact PTH 1-84, whereas no hepatic up￾take of carboxy terminal PTH fragments or synthetic b￾PTH 1-34 was demonstrable (9). In contrast, specific
uptake mechanisms for the synthetic amino terminal
fragment of PTH (syn b-PTH 1-34) were demonstrated
in the isolated perfused canine bone in vitro but only
minor uptake rates of intact hormone were demonstrable
(11). The kidney appears to have specific uptake
mechanisms for both the intact hormone and amino
tenninal fragment of PTH at sites independent of
glomerular filtration (10). Yet, the kidney also non￾specifically removes all forms of immunoreactive PTH
(i-PTH) through the mechanism of glomerular filtration
and tubular reabsorption (10, 12). This latter process
appears to be a nonspecific small peptide cleavage
mechanism important in protein catabolism (13, 14).
In the face of these advances, our quantitative

knowledge of the metabolism of intact PTH remains
inadequate. The metabolism of the hormone is thought
to be rapid, judging from the rapid initial rates of
disappearance of PTH following its addition to the cir￾culation (1, 3, 15, 16). However, formal quantitation
of the metabolic clearance rate (MCR) of intact PTH
has been determined only in calves (16). Thus far, the
estimates of the contributions of individual organs to
the MCR of intact PTH fail to account for signifi￾cant portions of the MCR (3, 17). The liver has been
identified as having the greatest uptake rate for intact
hormone (3, 9, 17). Studies by D'Amour et al. (17) sug￾gest that most of hepatic PTH uptake is localized to
Kupffer cells, and that hepatic cleavage of intact PTH
and production of C-terminal fragments can be at￾tributed to this cell type. However, data from our
laboratory (18) and others (19, 20) suggest that PTH
has important physiologic effects on hepatic glucose
and amino acid metabolism which are probably a func￾tion of the hepatocytes and not explainable by PTH
uptake by Kupffer cells alone. This may indicate that
there are additional sites of PTH uptake in the liver
besides the demonstrated binding to Kupffer cells.
Our earlier studies in dogs with chronic renal
failure (CRF) suggested that CRF results in a reduc￾tion not only of renal PTH metabolism, but also its
metabolism at an extrarenal site (5). Our initial at￾tempts to identify this site failed because of the limita￾tion of the C-terminal immunoassay being used. We
undertook the present studies for several purposes:
first, to provide further quantitation of the MCR of
intact PTH; second, to examine the uptake of intact
PTH by the liver and the kidney comparing the up￾take of biologically active and oxidized hormone; third,
to determine individual organ contributions to the total
MCR of intact PTH; and finally, to examine the effects
of CRF on the metabolism of intact hormone in order to
identify the site of impaired extrarenal PTH metabo￾lism in CRF.
METHODS
Preparation of dogs. Mongrel dogs weighing 14-28 kg
were fed a standard high protein Purina dog chow (Ralston￾Purina Co., St. Louis, Mo.) and had free access to water. In
those dogs in whom the hepatic metabolism of PTH was
studied, catheters were placed in the portal vein and the left
common hepatic vein as described previously (9). The method
of hepatic vein catheterization was originally described by
Shoemaker et al. (21). Catheter patency was maintained by
intermittent filling with heparin. After surgery, the dogs were
followed closely for resumption of normal dietary and bowel
habits. The shortest time interval after surgery to study was
72 h. Dogs that were not eating full rations or having normal
formed stools were not studied. In those dogs in whom the
metabolism of PTH by the kidney was studied, polyethylene
catheters were advanced from the inferior vena cava into the
renal vein at laparotomy. The catheters were filled with
heparin, and the studies were performed 24-48 h following
surgery.
CRF was induced by 75-85% infarction of the left kidney
followed by contralateral nephrectomy as previously de￾scribed (5). After induction of renal failure, the dogs were
stabilized for at least 4 wk before placement of hepatic,
portal, or renal vein catheters and performance of PTH
metabolism studies.
Study protocol. Dogs were studied awake and resting in
a sling after a 12-h fast. The femoral artery was catheterized
by the Seldinger technique (22) and a polyethylene catheter
was advanced into the aorta to the approximate level of the
celiac axis or the renal artery. A hind leg vein catheter was
placed for infusions of solutions and injections of PTH.
During studies of hepatic PTH metabolism, hepatic plasma
flow was measured by the previously reported methods (9,
23), using constant infusions of Indocyanine Green (ICG;
Hynson, Westcott, Dunning, Inc., Baltimore, Md.). The
hepatic arterial venous difference (a - v) for ICG also served
as a marker for adequacy of hepatic venous sampling to ex￾clude contamination of samples with inferior vena cava
blood (23). In studies of the renal metabolism of intact PTH,
glomerular filtration rate was measured by exogenous creati￾nine clearance and renal plasma flow was measured by the
extraction and clearance of paraminohippurate (PAH). PAH
extraction also served as a marker of adequacy of renal vein
sampling. In both types of studies, base-line periods were
conducted for determination of catheter function and renal
and hepatic plasma flow determinations. Then constant in￾fusions of bovine PTH (b-PTH 1-84) were begun following
bolus injections at 5-10 ,ug at a rate of 0.2-0.7 ,ug/min. This
infusion rate was found to maintain immunoreactive intact
PTH in the plasma at a concentration of 0.5-5.2 ng/ml. These
levels are lower than those at which we have reported cir￾culating amino terminal fragments following injections of
intact b-PTH 1-84 in dogs (5, 9). Equilibration of PTH levels
for 50 min was allowed before experimental periods were
begun. Then 5-10 experimental samples were obtained
from the aorta and/or the renal, hepatic, and portal veins
simultaneously. PTH infusions were administered through
the hind leg vein catheter. The PTH was added to dog plasma
obtained from each animal before the infusion and was kept
under ice during the infusion. The use of the dog plasma as a
carrier for the PTH was designed to limit loss of PTH through
adsorption to the infusion apparatus (24). Concentration of
PTH in the infusate was measured at the beginning, middle,
and end of the infusion and remained stable throughout the
duration of the infusions.
Source ofPTH. The b-PTH 1-84 used in these studies was
obtained from three lots of hormone prepared from extracts
of bovine parathyroid glands. PTH was purified according to
the method of Hamilton et al. (25), except that final purifi￾cation by carboxy methyl cellulose ion exchange chromatog￾raphy was performed using a linear gradient of ammonium
acetate in 8 M urea as the elution buffer. Hormone prepara￾tions so isolated revealed single peaks of radioimmunoassay￾able PTH-like activity when subjected to polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (Fig. IA). The biological activity of the
preparations was 2,000 U/mg in a renal cortical adenylate
cyclase assay (26). The standard, against which the biologi￾cal activity of our preparations was compared, was prepared
and standardized by Hamilton et al. (25). Synthetic bovine
PTH 1-34 (syn b-PTH 1-34) was obtained from Beckman
Instruments, Inc., Spinco Div., Palo Alto, Calif.). Oxidized
b-PTH 1-84 was prepared by dissolving lyophilized 50-,ug
aliquots of b-PTH 1-84 in 60 y of 150 mM acetic acid and
adding 40 al of 30% hydrogen peroxide. After incubation
at 37°C for 45 min, the reaction mixture was lyophilized. The
H202 oxidized b-PTH 1-84 was identical in its elution
position on polyacrylamide gels to biologically active b-PTH
1-84, and it had no significant biological activity in a renal

cortical adenylate cyclase assay (26). It also failed to induce
phosphaturia in the dogs studied in the present studies.
Radioimmunoassay methods. iPTH levels in plasma, in￾fusates, and polyacrylamide gel eluates were determined
by radioimmunoassay methods described in detail previously
(5, 9). The CH9N antiserum specific for the amino terminal
portion of b-PTH 1-84 was used in the determinations of
immunoassayable intact PTH. The amino terminal specificity
of this antiserum stems from the fact that it was produced
by a cockerel immunized with syn b-PTH 1-34. The anti￾serum was used in a dilution of 1:25,000 in these studies.
The displacement of 125I-b-PTH 1-84 binding to the CH9N
antiserum by unlabeled syn b-PTH 1-34, b-PTH 1-84, and
oxidized b-PTH 1-84 is shown in Fig. 2. Nearly complete
displacement of the iodinated tracer was produced by 130
finol of syn b-PTH 1-34 and 147 fimol b-PTH 1-84. Oxidized
b-PTH 1-84 was not different from b-PTH 1-84 in displacing
125I-b-PTH 1-84 from the CH9N antiserum. For determina￾tion of immunoreactive intact PTH, 125j-b-PTH 1-84 prepared
as previously described (5, 9), served as the radioactive tracer
and b-PTH 1-84 as the standard curve.

i-PTH levels below those where amino terminal fragments
would be detectable in the plasma samples. To confirm
that amino terminal fragments were not contributing sig￾nificantly to i-PTH levels in these studies, plasma samples
from each study were subjected to polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis. Eluates from the gels were subjected to
radioimmunoassay for detection of amino terminal fragments.
In addition, samples from the polyacrylamide gel eluates
were also subjected to C-terminal radioimmunoassay for com￾parison of the immunoreactive forms of C-terminal PTH in
the gel eluates. In these assays, the CH9 antiserum, a C￾terminal antiserum previously described (5, 9), was used as
the binding ligand and '25I-b-PTH 1-84 as the radio￾iodinated tracer and b-PTH 1-84 as the standard.
Gel electrophoresis was perform-ed in a tube gel apparatus
using 10% (wt/vol) acrylamide and 1% (wt/vol) bis-acrylamide
gels in 8 M urea according to the method of Riesfield et al.
(27), as previously described (26). 2-mm slices of the gels
were agitated for 24 h in 0.1 M sodium barbital buffer, pH
8.6 containing 10% plasma and 500 U/ml of Trasylol (FBA
Pharmaceuticals, New York), before immunoassay of PTH.
The extraction efficiency from the gels was 75-85% for both
b-PTH 1-84 and syn b-PTH 1-34. As shown in Fig. 1, poly￾acrylamide gel electrophoresis of plasma samples revealed i￾PTH eluting from the gels only in the area of the b-PTH 1-84
standard. The C-terminal immunoassays of the same samples
(data not shown) revealed multiple fragment peaks besides
the intact hormone peak. These results indicate that the
radioimmunoassay system using the CH9N antiserum, b-PTH
1-84 standard, and l2I1-b-PTH 1-84 tracer indeed represented
an immunoassay of intact PTH at the levels of PTH ob￾tained in the present studies.
Concentration of plasma samples. Plasma intact PTH
levels obtained in several studies were too low for direct
application to polyacrylamide gels since sample volume in
the gels system was limited (maximum, 100 ,lI). To check
for immunoassayable amino terminal fragments in these
plasma samples, they were concentrated prior to under￾going polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Concentration of
PTH was performed by the technique of adsorption of PTH
to microfine silica (Quso G-32) and elution from the silica
Hepatic and Renal Handling of Intact Parathyroid Hormone 887

by acetone/acetic acid. Quso, 2.5 mg/ml plasma, was added
to each sample to be concentrated. Plasma was then centri￾fuged at 2,500 rpm at 5C for 10 min and the supernate
was discarded. The precipitate was washed with 2 ml of dis￾tilled water and recentrifuged. Then, 0.5 ml of 30% acetone,
0.2% acetic acid, and 1.5 ml of H20 were added to the pre￾cipitate. After mixing, the samples were recentrifuged and
the supernates were lyophilized and reconstituted in 200
,ul of 0.1 M acetic acid in 8 M urea for gel electrophoresis.
Known amounts of b-PTH 1-84 and syn b-PTH 1-34 were
added to hypoparathyroid plasma and also subjected to the
adsorption technique for determination of recoveries. 60-
80% of both peptides were recovered in the lyophilized
eluates from the Quso. The plasma samples designated by
* and A in Fig. 1 were concentrated 10-fold by this technique
before polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In no plasma
sample was there detectable immunoassayable PTH (CH9N
antiserum) in gel eluates that migrated within the area of
syn b-PTH 1-34. The pattern of C-terminal immunoassayable
PTH in the gel eluates was similar to the patterns of non￾concentrated plasma samples, indicating recovery of all the
fragment forms that bound to the CH9 antiserum.
Chemical determinations. Constant infusions ofICG were
used to measure hepatic plasma flow and to check for adequacy
of hepatic venous sampling. The techniques of ICG infusion
and measurement have been reported previously in detail
(9). Exogenous creatinine infusions were used to determine
glomerular filtration rate. Creatinine concentrations were
measured by the Jaffe reaction as described by Folin (28)
and adapted for the Technicon autoanalyzer (Technicon In￾struments, Inc., Tarrytown, N. Y.). Infusions of PAH were
utilized to determine renal plasma flow and the adequacy
of renal venous sampling. PAH concentrations were deter￾mined by the method of Harvey and Brothers (29), as adapted
for the Technicon autoanalyzer.
Calculations. Hepatic plasma flow was calculated by
dividing the MCR of ICG (ICG infusion rate/arterial ICG
concentration) by the hepatic a - v difference of ICG. Renal
plasma flow was calculated by the Wolff modification of the
Fick principle (30) using clearances ofPAH. Filtration fraction
was determined as the ratio of creatinine clearance and renal
plasma flow. The percent hepatic and renal a - v difference
of intact PTH was determined by dividing the a - v con￾centration difference of intact PTH by the arterial intact PTH
concentration. MCR of intact PTH was determined by divid￾ing the infusion rate of intact PTH in ng/ml by the stable
arterial PTH concentration. Endogenous PTH was detectable
in only one of the CRF dogs and these levels were sub￾tracted from the levels determined during PTH 1-84 infusion.
The renal and hepatic clearances of PTH were determined
by multiplying the percent a - v difference of intact PTh
by the plasma flow for each organ. Statistical differences be￾tween groups was assessed by Student's t test.
RESULTS
The metabolism of intact PTH in dogs with hepatic
vein and portal vein catheters is shown in Table I. The
arterial plasma intact PTH levels listed represent the
mean of at least five determinations, deviating by no
more than 5% from the mean level. Thus, these levels
fulfill the criteria for determination of MCR by the
constant infusion technique (31,32). The mean MCR of
intact PTH in the normal dogs with hepatic vein cathe￾ters was 19.7+1.1 ml/min per kg. The hepatic handling
of ICG revealed adequate extraction in all instances.
The data shown are the mean of at least five determina￾tions in each animal. Paired arterial and hepatic venous

difference for ICG were not included in the radio￾immunoassays for PTH. The hepatic a - v difference
of ICG and the calculated hepatic plasma flow in the
normal dog is similar to results previously published
from our laboratory (9) and others (23). The a - v dif￾ference of intact PTH across the liver was 45+3%. The
hepatic clearance of intact PTH was 12.0±0.8 ml/min
per kg, and this represented 61±4% of the total MCR.
Thus, the MCR of intact PTH is very rapid, and the liver
accounts for the majority of its removal rate from the
plasma.
Attempts were made to reduce infusion rates of PTH
in studies of dogs with CRF, such that the plasma in￾tact PTH levels attained did not substantially differ
from those attained in normal dogs. In dogs with CRF,
the MCR of intact PTH was reduced to 11.8± 1.4
ml/min per kg. The hepatic handling of ICG by the
dogs with CRF was not significantly different from
normal, and the calculated hepatic flow did not differ
from values seen in normal dogs. The hepatic a - v
difference of intact PTH was significantly depressed
in dogs with CRF to 28±4 (P < 0.005 compared with
normal dogs). The reduction in the percent extraction
of intact PTH by the liver resulted in a reduction of
hepatic PTH clearance to 8.2± 1.0 ml/min per kg. This
indicates that CRF not only reduces the renal metab￾olism of PTH, but also reduces the hepatic metabolism
of intact PTH. The hepatic contribution to the total
MCR in dogs with CRF was 69±7%, not significantly
different from the value observed in normal animals.
Thus, the decrease in a - v difference for PTH by
the liver in CRF impairs the ability of the liver to serve
as a compensatory organ for the decreased clearance
of PTH by the kidney in this condition. There was no
significant detectable a - v difference for PTH be￾tween arterial and portal venous plasma in either
normal dogs or dogs with CRF (data not shown). Thus,
significant uptake of intact PTH by splanchnic organs
was not detectable in these studies.
The metabolism of intact PTH in dogs with renal vein
catheters is shown in Table II. Plasma intact PTH
levels in these animals were within the range of those
portrayed in Table I. The MCR of intact PTH in these
normal dogs was 24±3.9 ml/min per kg, not signifi￾cantly different from the normal animals portrayed in
Table I. The mean values for PAH extraction, renal
plasma flow, creatinine clearance, and a - v dif￾ference for intact PTH represent the mean of at least
five determinations obtained during the constant in￾fusions of b-PTH 1-84. The a - v difference for intact

PTH across the kidney was 29±+2%, a value signifi￾cantly greater than the filtration fraction of 20.6+0.4%
(P < 0.01). This indicates that the extraction of intact
PTH by the normal dog kidney is greater than what
could be accounted for by glomerular filtration alone
assuming a sieving coefficient of one. However, Kau
and Maack (12) have estimated a sieving coefficient
of 0.7 for PTH 1-84. This further indicates the signifi￾cance of the a - v difference of 29% for intact PTH
observed in our studies. The renal clearance of intact
PTH was 7.2±0.8 ml/min per kg. This value repre￾sented 31±3% of the total MCR of intact PTH.
In dogs with CRF, the MCR of intact PTH was re￾duced to 10.7±+1.4 ml/min per kg, not significantly
different from the CRF group shown in Table I. The
a - v difference for intact PTH across the chronically
diseased kidney was 20±1%, a value very similar to
the filtration fraction and significantly reduced from
the a - v difference of intact PTH across the normal
dog kidney (P < 0.005). Thus, the renal clearance of
intact PTH in CRF is decreased not only by the de￾creased renal plasma flow but also by the decrease
in the percent a - v difference. This differs from the
previously reported results for C-terminal i-PTH (5),
where the reduction of renal clearance resulted solely
from a reduction in plasma flow while the a - v dif￾ference for C-terminal i-PTH remained constant. The
severe reduction in renal clearance of intact PTH re￾sulted in a reduction in the renal contribution to the
total MCR to 9±1%.
The rapid MCR of intact PTH and the high levels
of hepatic and renal intact PTH uptake shown above
may, in part, be due to uptake mechanisms recog￾nizing only biologically active PTH. To analyze this
possibility, we studied the metabolism of oxidized,
biologically inactive intact PTH. PTH, obtained from
the same lots used in the studies reported above, was
oxidized and infused into five normal dogs with in￾dwelling hepatic (3) or renal (2) vein catheters. These
dogs had been used previously in the studies reported
in Tables I and II. Infusion of intact PTH had resulted
in a reduction of tubular reabsorption of phosphate
from a fasting level of 96 to 77%. The infusion of
oxidized PTH in the animals resulted in no reduction
of the tubular reabsorption of phosphate (Table III).
The MCR of oxidized intact PTH was 8.8±1.0 ml/min
per kg, significantly reduced (P < 0.01) from the values
for biologically active intact PTH shown in the normal
dogs in Tables I and II. This reduction in total MCR
was contributed to mainly by a reduction in the hepatic
a - v difference from a level of 45% seen in the
studies with biologically active PTH to a level of 13% in
the studies with inactive PTH. The reduction in the
hepatic a - v difference resulted in a decrease in
hepatic clearance from 12.0 to 2.5 ml/min per kg.
During infusion of oxidized PTH into dogs with renal

vein catheters, the renal PAH extraction was 73% and
the filtration fraction was 21%. The renal a - v dif￾ference for oxidized b-PTH 1-84 was 21%. The reduc￾tion in the renal a - v difference of oxidized PTH
observed when compared to b-PTH 1-84 resulted in a
reduction of renal PTH clearance from 7.2 ml/min per
kg to 4.9 ml/min per kg, a value that accounted for
55% of the total MCR. The apparent increase in the
renal contribution to total MCR in the studies with
oxidized PTH is similar to the renal contribution to
total MCR previously demonstrated by us for C-termi￾nal i-PTH. These data suggest that the body's handling
of biologically inactive intact PTH is significantly
altered when compared to the handling of biologically
active intact hormone. The reduction in the renal a - v
difference of oxidized PTH was compatible with the
major portion of PTH uptake now being accounted for
by glomerular filtration and tubular reabsorption as
others using oxidized iodinated PTH have sug￾gested (12).
One possible explanation, for the reduced MCR of
oxidized b-PTH 1-84, would be association of the
oxidized hormone with large plasma proteins that
should then decrease the uptake of oxidized PTH from
plasma. Nonspecific association of radiolabeled oxi￾dized intact PTH to plasma proteins in column elution
buffers is well known (33, 34). The plasma samples
taken at various times following single injections of
both b-PTH 1-84 and oxidized b-PTH 1-84 into dogs,
were subjected to gel permeation chromatography
using Bio-gel P-100 (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Richmond,
Calif.). The elution buffer was 0.15 M ammonium
acetate containing 10% normal dog plasma. The
amounts of both b-PTH 1-84 and oxidized b-PTH 1-84
bound to plasma proteins and eluting in the area of
the void volume of the column were identical at 5 and
20 min following injection. They represented a small
fraction of the i-PTH eluting in the area of intact
hormone. Thus, oxidized PTH in this system did not
demonstrate a greater proclivity for plasma protein
binding than b-PTH 1-84.

DISCUSSION
The studies reported here demonstrate a very rapid
MCR of intact PTH. These MCR are compatible with
the short (2-5 min) half-time of disappearance for
intact PTH suggested by previous studies (15, 16). The
MCR of intact PTH is also much more rapid than that
reported for C-terminal i-PTH (5, 8). If the rapidity
of the MCR for intact PTH is in part due to uptake
of the hormone at binding sites that specifically
recognize biologically active hormone, then inactiva￾tion of the hormone would be expected to reduce its
MCR. Potts et al. (35) have demonstrated that oxi￾dation of PTH results in loss of its biological activity
without alteration in its immunologic properties. The
MCR of oxidized intact PTH reported here was
markedly reduced compared with nonoxidized hor￾mone. This reduction in MCR was contributed to by
decreased uptake rates of PTH both by the liver and
the kidney. Thus, these results are compatible with the
hypothesis that the rapid metabolic clearance of intact
PTH is in part related to uptake at sites specific for
biologically active hormone.
The MCR of intact PTH was largely due to hepatic
and renal uptake of intact PTH. The sum of the hepatic
clearance (12.0±0.8 ml/min per kg) and the renal
clearance (7.2 ±0.8 ml/min per kg) represent 89% of the
MCR of intact PTH in all of the normal dogs studied
(21.6±3.1 ml/min per kg). These results are in concert
with a low rate of intact PTH uptake by the other major
target organ of PTH, the skeleton. In fact, studies using
the isolated perfused canine bone (11) and isotopic
localization of injected 1251-b-PTH 1-84 (3, 36) have
revealed low to minimal uptake rates of intact PTH by
the skeleton.
Hepatic uptake of intact PTH accounted for the
greatest fraction of the MCR of intact PTH. These data
are in agreement with previous studies (3, 9, 17). The
results reported here demonstrating high rates of
hepatic PTH uptake that are decreased by inactivation
of the hormone are compatible with the hypothesis that
part of the demonstrated PTH uptake was due to bind￾ing to sites specific for biologically active hormone.
Hepatic uptake of biologically active PTH is related
to the actions of PTH on hepatic glucose and amino
acid metabolism (17-19), and thus, it would be ex￾pected to be localized in part to cells responsible for
these functions, namely hepatocytes. However, the
cellular sites ofhepatic PTH uptake remain in question.
Studies by D'Amour et al. (17), indicate that at 4 min
following injection of intact PTH, the Kupffer cells
are the major identifiable site of PTH uptake. At later
times, after PTH injection, these authors reported PTH
localization to both hepatocytes and Kupffer cells.
The dependence of the high rate of hepatic clearance
of PTH on its biologic activity may also explain why
the hepatic uptake of PTH reported here was greater
than previously reported for biologically inactive PTH
(3, 17). In fact, Neuman et al. (3), using radiolabeled
intact PTH by a technique reported to preserve bio￾logical activity, demonstrated increasing hepatic PTH
uptake associated with increasing biological activity
of the hormone.
The renal a - v difference for intact PTH reported
here of 29% was significantly higher than the uptake
rate, which could be accounted for by glomerular
filtration alone. This nonglomerular uptake of PTH
may possibly represent binding to PTH-specific re￾ceptors. If this were the case, one might expect a
decrease in the renal uptake of intact PTH following
inactivation of the hormone. In fact, previous investi￾gators (37) have demonstrated lack of PTH binding
to renal receptors following oxidation of the hormone.
Our results demonstrated a reduction in the renal a - v
difference for intact PTH from 29 to 20% following
oxidization of the hormone. This value is not different
from the filtration fraction and thus largely explain￾able by glomerular filtration. Thus, it appears that a
specific renal uptake mechanism recognizing only
biologically active PTH was demonstrable in our
current studies.
The effects of CRF on the metabolism of intact
PTH were dramatic. There was a marked reduction in
the MCR of intact PTH. This was contributed to by a
reduction of 38% in the hepatic a - v difference for
intact PTH that resulted in a marked decrease in
hepatic clearance of the hormone. This identifies the
liver as an extrarenal site of PTH metabolism affected
by CRF. It probably identifies the liver as the extra￾renal sites of PTH metabolism affected by CRF in
our previous studies (5). CRF also decreased the renal
clearance of intact PTH. In contrast to our previous
report (5), the reduction in renal clearance was due to
both a reduction in the a - v difference for intact PTH
and the reduction in renal plasma flow. Further studies
are required to investigate the effect of CRF on the
characteristics of PTH receptor binding.
In summary, the studies reported here demonstrate
very rapid MCR of intact PTH contributed to chiefly
by the liver and the kidney. The rapid total MCR, and
the high rate of hepatic and renal uptake appear to
be partially dependent on PTH uptake at sites recog￾nizing only biologically active intact PTH. CRF
markedly reduced the total MCR of intact PTH by
decreasing both extrarenal (hepatic) and renal PTH
uptake. Thus, CRF appears to negatively affect uptake
rates by the major organs responsible for the metabo￾lism of intact PTH.
