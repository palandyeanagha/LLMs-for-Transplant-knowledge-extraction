ABSTRACT
OBJECTIVE
To describe outcomes of people admitted to 
hospital with coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) 
in the United States, and the clinical and laboratory 
characteristics associated with severity of illness.
DESIGN
Prospective cohort study.
SETTING
Single academic medical center in New York City and 
Long Island.
PARTICIPANTS
5279 patients with laboratory confirmed severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) 
infection between 1 March 2020 and 8 April 2020. The 
final date of follow up was 5 May 2020.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Outcomes were admission to hospital, critical illness 
(intensive care, mechanical ventilation, discharge to 
hospice care, or death), and discharge to hospice care 
or death. Predictors included patient characteristics, 
medical history, vital signs, and laboratory results. 
Multivariable logistic regression was conducted 
to identify risk factors for adverse outcomes, and 
competing risk survival analysis for mortality.
RESULTS
Of 11544 people tested for SARS-Cov-2, 5566 
(48.2%) were positive. After exclusions, 5279 were 
included. 2741 of these 5279 (51.9%) were admitted 
to hospital, of whom 1904 (69.5%) were discharged 
alive without hospice care and 665 (24.3%) were 
discharged to hospice care or died. Of 647 (23.6%) 
patients requiring mechanical ventilation, 391 
(60.4%) died and 170 (26.2%) were extubated or 
discharged. The strongest risk for hospital admission 
was associated with age, with an odds ratio of >2 for 
all age groups older than 44 years and 37.9 (95% 
confidence interval 26.1 to 56.0) for ages 75 years 
and older. Other risks were heart failure (4.4, 2.6 to 
8.0), male sex (2.8, 2.4 to 3.2), chronic kidney disease 
(2.6, 1.9 to 3.6), and any increase in body mass index 
(BMI) (eg, for BMI >40: 2.5, 1.8 to 3.4). The strongest 
risks for critical illness besides age were associated 
with heart failure (1.9, 1.4 to 2.5), BMI >40 (1.5, 1.0 to 
2.2), and male sex (1.5, 1.3 to 1.8). Admission oxygen 
saturation of <88% (3.7, 2.8 to 4.8), troponin level >1 
(4.8, 2.1 to 10.9), C reactive protein level >200 (5.1, 
2.8 to 9.2), and D-dimer level >2500 (3.9, 2.6 to 6.0) 
were, however, more strongly associated with critical 
illness than age or comorbidities. Risk of critical 
illness decreased significantly over the study period. 
Similar associations were found for mortality alone.
CONCLUSIONS
Age and comorbidities were found to be strong 
predictors of hospital admission and to a lesser 
extent of critical illness and mortality in people 
with covid-19; however, impairment of oxygen on 
admission and markers of inflammation were most 
strongly associated with critical illness and mortality. 
Outcomes seem to be improving over time, potentially 
suggesting improvements in care.
Introduction
On 31 December 2019, China announced a cluster of 
novel pneumonia-like illness. The causative organism, 
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
(SARS-Cov-2), has to date infected more than 4.8 
million people globally and been responsible for more 
than 318000 known deaths from coronavirus disease 
2019 (covid-19). The virus has resulted in a pandemic.
Though several reports from China,1 2 Italy,3 4 and 
most recently the United States5-7 have described 
some characteristics of people with covid-19, little 
is understood about factors associated with hospital 
admission and severe disease. Studies so far have 
included few people with severe outcomes1 8-12 or have 
not compared people with severe disease with those 
with less virulent disease,13-15 making it difficult to 
assess characteristics associated with poor outcomes. 
Few large studies have conducted multivariable 
regression to help identify the strongest risk factors.
New York City is now the epicenter of the covid-19 
outbreak in the US, with more than 190000 known 
cases in the city and more than 15000 confirmed

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC
Demographics and prevalence of comorbidities in patients with coronavirus 
disease 2019 (covid-19), particularly those admitted to hospital, have been 
described in several countries
Early outcomes of people with critical illness have been described but usually 
include a substantial portion of patients still with incomplete follow-up
It is uncertain which characteristics, comorbidities, and laboratory results are 
associated with an increase in risk for adverse outcomes
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS
In this study of people with covid-19 tested and treated at a health system in 
New York City the overall mortality rate for patients admitted to hospital was 
between 24% and 30%
Age, heart failure, male sex, chronic kidney disease, and obesity were associated 
with hospital admission and development of critical illness once admitted
Hypoxia and increased inflammatory laboratory studies early in hospital 
admission were important markers for adverse events

deaths as of 19 May: more than anywhere else in the 
country.16 We describe the characteristics of people 
with covid-19 treated at a large quaternary academic 
health system in New York City and Long Island, and 
the association of these characteristics with adverse 
outcomes.
Methods
Study setting
The study was conducted at NYU Langone Health, 
which includes more than 260 outpatient office sites 
and four acute care hospitals (Tisch Hospital and NYU 
Langone Orthopedic Hospital in Manhattan, NYU 
Langone Hospital – Brooklyn in Brooklyn, and NYU 
Winthrop on Long Island), ranging from a quaternary 
care hospital to a safety net institution.17 As the 
epidemic evolved, the health system added intensive 
care unit (ICU) beds and inpatient capacity, resulting in 
a peak of about 394 ICU beds and 1357 non-ICU beds.
Study cohort
We identified all patients who were tested for SARS￾Cov-2 between 1 March 2020 and 8 April 2020. 
We then created a cohort of those with confirmed 
covid-19, defined as a positive result on real time 
reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT￾PCR) assay of nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab 
specimens. Initial tests were conducted by the New York 
City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene; as of 16 
March, tests were conducted in our clinical laboratory 
using the Roche SARS-CoV2 assay in the Cobas 6800 
instruments through emergency use authorization 
granted by the US Food and Drug Administration. On 
31 March, we added testing using the SARS-CoV2 Xpert 
Xpress assay in the Cepheid GeneXpert instruments 
also under emergency use authorization by the FDA. 
The targets amplified by these assays are the ORF1/a 
and E genes in the Roche Cobas assay and N2 and E 
genes in the Cepheid XpertXpress. After 16 March, only 
nasopharyngeal samples were collected and tested.
Testing was performed on people presenting to the 
emergency department who were likely to be admitted 
with any symptom or sign consistent with covid-19, 
including fever, cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, 
gastrointestinal problems, syncope, known exposure 
to a patient positive for covid-19, or clinician concern. 
In addition, ambulatory testing was available by 
appointment with clinician’s referral until 26 March 
2020, when New York state recommended restricting 
testing of people with mild or moderate illness. 
Outpatient testing of symptomatic or concerned 
employees remained available throughout the study 
period. Repeat testing of negative specimens was 
conducted at clinician discretion. If testing was 
repeated and discordant (ie, negative test followed by 
a positive test), we used the positive result.
From the covid-19 cohort we excluded 287 people 
who were not admitted to hospital, were missing all 
data besides age and sex, and had no previous visits 
within the health system. We obtained complete follow 
up on the covid-19 cohort through 5 May 2020.
Data sources
Study data were obtained from the electronic health 
record (Epic Systems, Verona, WI), which is an 
integrated electronic health record including all 
inpatient and outpatient visits in the health system. 
For data on tobacco use, body mass index (BMI), and 
comorbidities, we included any data in the electronic 
health record, including data entered during previous 
inpatient or outpatient visits in the problem list, 
medical history section, or on encounter diagnoses.
Main outcomes
We assessed three primary outcomes: inpatient hospital 
admissions; critical illness, defined as a composite 
of care in the intensive care unit, use of mechanical 
ventilation, discharge to hospice, or death; and 
discharge to hospice or death among those admitted 
to hospital. We assessed outcomes longitudinally over 
the entire study period, not just at the time of the initial 
testing event. For patients with multiple visits, the most 
severe outcome was assigned. For instance, patients 
who did not need hospital admission at the time of 
initial testing but were later admitted were assigned 
to the hospital group. Similarly, patients who were 
initially admitted and discharged and then readmitted 
requiring invasive ventilation were assigned to the 
critical illness group.
Predictors
We obtained several variables from the electronic 
health record: age at time of testing, sex, race/
ethnicity as reported by the patient (aggregated into 
non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic African-American, 
Asian, Hispanic, other/multiracial, and unknown), 
and history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary 
artery disease, heart failure, pulmonary disease 
(defined by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
or asthma), malignancy (excluding non-metastatic 
non-melanoma skin cancer), diabetes, and obesity 
(defined by most recent BMI). We also obtained vital 
signs and the first set of laboratory results when 
available. For multivariable modeling, we grouped 
vital sign and laboratory results into categories by 
degree of abnormality based on clinical judgment 
because of non-linear associations with outcome. We 
selected these predictors based on previous published 
literature15 and our clinical experience of patients with 
covid-19.
Statistical analysis
We used descriptive statistics to characterize each 
cohort of patients: those not admitted to hospital, 
all those admitted, those admitted without critical 
illness, and those with critical illness (care in ICU, 
mechanical ventilation, discharge to hospice, or 
death). We then fitted multivariable logistic regression 
models with admission and with critical illness as the 
outcomes to identify factors associated with those 
outcomes. In analyses using hospital admission as 
the outcome, we included only patient characteristics 
and comorbidities, since 77% of the patients who were Protected by copyright, including for uses related to text and data mining, AI training, and similar technologies.

not admitted were evaluated in ambulatory testing 
centers and did not have vitals or laboratory studies 
collected. For the critical illness analyses, we included 
the above predictors and for one of the models added 
temperature and oxygen saturation on presentation, as 
well as the first result of C reactive protein, D-dimer, 
ferritin, procalcitonin, and troponin when obtained. 
We included all selected predictors based on a priori 
clinical significance after testing for collinearity using 
the variance inflation factor and ensuring none had 
a variance inflation factor greater than 2.18 We also 
tested for overall multicollinearity among all variables 
simultaneously using the determinant of correlation 
matrix implemented in R’s mctest library and found no 
significant results.19
For the admission model, we included all patients 
testing positive (excluding the 287 patients with no 
data besides age and sex). We constructed two models 
for association with critical illness. First, we constructed 
a model restricted to patients admitted to hospital, 
including all personal and comorbidity predictors, 
and a random effect for hospital to account for 
clustering by facility. Second, we added to that model 
vital signs and the first set of laboratory results, to 
assess clinical associations with critical illness among 
patients admitted to hospital. We excluded from the 
second model four patients who died in the emergency 
department before vital signs or laboratory results could 
be collected. We obtained odds ratios from the models 
and profiled confidence intervals for the odds ratios 
using the approach of Venables and Ripley,20 since 
assuming normality of the maximum likelihood estimate 
to estimate Wald-type confidence intervals can lead to 
biased estimates.21 We also calculated average marginal 
effects for each predictor by using the margins library 
in R, which uses a discrete first difference in predicted 
outcomes to obtain the average marginal effect.
Finally, we fitted a competing risk model for the 
mortality or hospice outcome with time from first 
positive test result as the start point, including 
only patients admitted to hospital.22 We considered 
discharge from hospital to be a competing risk, since 
mortality data are limited after that point unless the 
patient is readmitted to our system (in which case 
the newest hospital admission would be included). 
Patients still in hospital as of 5 May 2020 were 
counted as censored. The model was fitted with the R 
library cmprisk,23 and the proportionality assumption 
was checked with the goffte library.24 We fitted two 
competing risk models, one adjusting for personal 
characteristics and comorbidities, and one adding 
admission vitals and laboratory studies.
All statistical analyses were conducted with R, 
version 3.6.3. All analyses used two sided statistical 
tests and we considered a P value less than 0.05 to 
be statistically significant without adjustment for 
multiple testing.
Patient and public involvement
Patients and the public were not a priori involved in 
the design and conduct of the study, the choice of 
outcomes, recruitment, or planned dissemination. 
However, we incorporated many comments from the 
public on an earlier preprint version of the paper into 
the final analysis.
Results
During the study period, the health system tested 
11544 people for severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2). Of those tested, 5566 
(48.2%) were positive and 287 were excluded for lack 
of data. Of the remaining 5279 patients testing positive, 
2538 (48.1%) were treated only as outpatients through 
the end of the study period, and 2741 (51.9%) required 
admission to hospital. Nearly all those admitted to the 
hospital (2729, 99.6%) experienced a study outcome: 
1739/2741 (63.4%) were discharged without critical 
illness and 990/2741 (36.1%) experienced critical 
illness, including 665/2741 (24.3%) who were 
discharged to a hospice or died to date.
Among the 990 patients with critical illness, 647 
(65.4%) required mechanical ventilation, 102 (10.3%) 
required intensive care without mechanical ventilation, 
and 241 (24.3%) were discharged to a hospice or 
died without either intensive care or mechanical 
ventilation. Figure 1 shows the final outcomes to date 
for each subgroup.
Characteristics of study population
The median age of the study population that tested 
positive for covid-19 was 54 years (interquartile range 
38-66 years), and 2615 (49.5%) were men. A total 
of 1195 (22.6%) had diabetes, 1865 (35.3%) were 
obese (BMI ≥30), and 2752 (52.1%) had any form of 
cardiovascular disease. Among patients admitted 
to hospital, the median length of stay was 7 days 
(interquartile range 3-13; full range 0-52 days). Median 
length of stay for those still in hospital with critical 
illness (n=160) was 36 days (32-40, full range 3-52 
days). See appendix table S1 for characteristics of those 
who tested negative. Among tests performed in the 
emergency department, 83.9% were for patients who 
were admitted and 16.1% were for patients who were 
discharged (see appendix tables S2 and S3). Appendix 
table S4 shows the characteristics of patients seen in 
the emergency department for suspected covid-19 but 
who were not tested.
People admitted to hospital were more likely to be 
men (61.2% v 36.9%) and were considerably more 
likely to have comorbidities than people not admitted 
(any comorbidity, 79.7% v 44.8%), particularly 
cardiovascular disease (70.6% v 32.2%), diabetes 
(34.7% v 9.7%), and chronic kidney disease (21.2% 
v 2.6%; table 1). Differences in sex and comorbidities 
between admitted patients experiencing critical illness 
and those who did not were much smaller. Among 
these patients, differences in clinical presentation 
and laboratory results were more prominent. Patients 
with critical illness more often presented with hypoxia 
(initial oxygen saturation 25th centile 86% v 92%), 
and had higher initial levels of C reactive protein 
(median 136.3 v 89.1), D-dimer (median 528 v 324), Protected by copyright, including for uses related to text and data mining, AI training, and similar technologies.

ferritin (median 925 v 613), procalcitonin (0.27 v
0.10), and troponin (0.07 v 0.02; table 2).
Predictors of hospital admission
In multivariable analysis of the full covid-19 positive 
cohort, the factors most strongly associated with 
hospital admission were age, including 75 years or older 
(odds ratio 37.9, 95% confidence interval 26.1 to 56.0; 
average marginal effect 58%) and 65 to 74 years (8.7, 8.7 
to 11.2, 40%), heart failure (4.4, 2.6 to 8.0, 22%), male 
sex (2.8, 2.4 to 3.2, 16%), chronic kidney disease (2.6, 
1.9 to 3.6, 14%), and any increase in BMI (eg, BMI >40: 
2.5, 1.8 to 3.4, 14%). Also significant was hypertension. 
Hyperlipidemia was associated with a lower risk of 
hospital admission (0.6, 0.5 to 0.7, −7%) as was former 
or current smoking status; however, unknown smoking 
status was associated with a higher risk (1.4, 1.2 to 1.8, 
5%; table 1). A sensitivity analysis adding patients seen 
in the emergency department for suspected covid-19 but 
not tested produced similar results (appendix table S5), 
as did a different sensitivity analysis restricting patients 
who were not admitted to hospital to those tested in the 
emergency department (appendix table S6).
Among people admitted to hospital with covid-19, 
the factors most associated with critical illness were 
age, including 75 years or older (odds ratio 3.5, 95% 
confidence interval 2.5 to 4.8) and 65 to 74 years (2.9, 
2.1 to 4.0), heart failure (1.9, 1.4 to 2.5), BMI greater than 
40 (1.5, 1.0 to 2.2), and male sex (1.5, 1.3 to 1.8), with 
diabetes also significant (table 3). Risk of critical illness 
declined progressively as the study period progressed, 
with the lowest being in the last week (0.4, 0.2 to 0.6).
Being of self-reported Hispanic ethnicity was 
associated with an increased risk of hospital admission 
but not of critical illness; the increased risk of admission 
was eliminated once emergency department treat-and￾release patients were included (appendix table S5). 
Non-Hispanic African-American patients had a risk of 
admission similar to white patients and a lower risk of 
critical illness (0.7, 0.5 to 0.9).
After adding admission vital signs and first set of 
laboratory results to the critical illness model, only 
age, heart failure, and BMI greater than 40 remained 
associated with significant risks; in this model, the 
factors most associated with critical illness were oxygen 
saturation on admission less than 88% (3.7, 2.8 to 4.8),

troponin level greater than 1 (4.8, 2.1 to 10.9), C reactive 
protein level greater than 200 (5.1, 2.8 to 9.2), and 
D-dimer level greater than 2500 (3.9, 2.6 to 6.0; table 3).
The competing risk mortality analysis showed similar 
characteristics to confer increased hazard as the critical 
illness model, but fewer were significant. The hazard 
ratio increased proportionally by age: 10.3 (95% 
confidence interval 6.4 to 16.8) for age 75 years or older. 
Other significant factors included heart failure (1.8, 1.4 
to 2.2), male sex (1.3, 1.1 to 1.5), and cancer (1.3, 1.1 to 
1.6). Vital signs and laboratory results on presentation 
carried a significant additional hazard, chiefly hypoxia 
on presentation (2.0, 1.6 to 2.5 for oxygen saturation 
<88%), C reactive protein (all abnormal levels had 
hazard ratios >3.5), D-dimer (2.2, 1.6 to 3.0 for first 
result >2500), and troponin (2.1, 1.4 to 3.2 for first 
result >1) (table 4). Representative cumulative incidence 
functions are shown in figure 2 (age groupings), figure 3 
(heart failure, cancer, diabetes, and men), and figures 4 
and 5 (admission oxygen saturation, D-dimer levels, C 
reactive protein and lymphocyte count).
Discussion
In this report, we describe the characteristics of 
adults with laboratory confirmed coronavirus disease 
2019 (covid-19) in New York City. Of 5279 adults, 
2741 required hospital admission; and 990 required 
intensive care or mechanical ventilation, were 
discharged to hospice care, or died. A total of 94% of 
patients admitted to hospital have been discharged 
alive or to hospice care or have died, providing 
robust final outcome results. We find particularly 
strong associations of older age, male sex, heart 
failure, chronic kidney disease, and obesity with

hospital admission and risk of critical illness among 
all patients with covid-19, with less influence of 
chronic pulmonary disease (asthma or chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease) and other forms of 
heart disease. By contrast, we found comorbidities 
to be less strongly associated with critical illness in 
patients admitted to hospital. Among those patients, 
we noted the importance of hypoxia despite the 
provision of supplemental oxygen and early increases 
in inflammatory markers (especially D-dimer and C 
reactive protein) in distinguishing between patients 
who go on to develop critical illness and those who do 
not. In the population admitted to hospital, measures 
of inflammation were much more important than 
personal characteristics and comorbidities.
Comparison with other studies
The first detailed covid-19 case series included 1099 
hospital inpatients with laboratory confirmed infection 
in China, of whom only 25 (2.3%) underwent invasive 
ventilation and 15 (1.4%) died.1
 A recent report of 
5700 patients admitted to hospital from a different 
health system in New York City found that at least 9.7% 
had already died (24.5% of mechanically ventilated 
patients); however, 53.8% of the patients in this study 
(72.2% of ventilated) were still in hospital, with a 
median follow-up of only 4.5 days. By contrast, 23.6% 
of patients admitted to hospital in our case series 
required invasive ventilation and 24.3% have died 
as of 5 May, with 94% of patients having completed 
hospital admissions. If all remaining inpatients died,

the patients had any chronic comorbidity, whereas in 
our series 80% of patients admitted to hospital had at 
least one of eight major chronic diseases.1
In fact, outcomes in most of the reports were similar 
to ours. A commentary by the Chinese Center for Disease 
Control and Prevention described outcomes for 72314
patients, of whom 14% had severe disease (similar to 
patients admitted to hospital in our series) and 5% had 
critical illness with respiratory or multi-organ failure 
(similar to those requiring intensive care unit (ICU) level 
care or mechanical ventilation in our series).2
 Among 
patients with critical illness, mortality was 49%; 
we found this to be 57% among all ICU or ventilated 
patients. Finally, our results are also consistent with a 
recent national case series reported by the US Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention, which found that 
457 of 1037 (44.1%) patients admitted to hospital 
required ICU admission, and that three quarters had 
at least one chronic condition.6
 Overall, the death rate 
we find for critically ill patients is a bit higher than the 
typical mortality rate from acute respiratory distress 
syndrome (ARDS) of about 35-45%.27 28
The comorbidities we identified as associated with 
hospital admission in covid-19 are largely similar to 
those associated with any type of severe infectious 
disease requiring hospital admission or ICU level care,29
though we were surprised that chronic pulmonary 
disease did not feature more prominently. Others 
have also noted the absence of asthma and chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease as risks for severity of 
illness in patients with covid-19.30 The epidemiologic 
and/or pathophysiologic reasons for this are unknown. 
The demographic distribution of patients admitted to 
hospital with covid-19 is also similar to those admitted 
with other acute respiratory infections. For instance, 
though advanced age was by far the most important 
predictor of hospital admission and severe outcomes 
(as it is for most illnesses), 53% of patients admitted to 
hospital were younger than 65 years. This is typical of 
the pattern for hospital admissions in viral respiratory 
disease. Studies of patients admitted to hospital with 
influenza in the United States have found that people 
younger than 65 years (including children) account for 
53-57% of influenza related hospital admissions.31 32
Surprisingly, though some have speculated that 
high rates of smoking in China explained some of the 
morbidity in those patients, we did not find tobacco 
use to be associated with increased risk of hospital 
admission or of critical illness; in fact, it even seemed 
protective for hospital admission. However, this could 
be artifactual: patients with unknown smoking status 
had significantly higher risks of admission and of critical 
illness. It is possible that data are disproportionately 
missing for current or former smokers who might not 
care to answer that question; if so, that would attenuate 
the apparent benefit of smoking. Few (<5%) patients 
had a recorded history of vaping; separate analyses 
could not be conducted for this group.

emerging case reports suggest that patients with 
severe covid-19 disease are developing complications 
from hypercoagulability,10 including both pulmonary 
emboli34 and microscopic thrombi.35 It is notable that 
one of the chronic conditions strongly associated with 
critical illness was obesity. Obesity is well recognized 
to be a pro-inflammatory condition.36 37 In addition, 
this might explain why hyperlipidemia seemed 
protective for hospital admission in multivariable 
analysis, though not in univariate analysis and not for 
critical illness: statin treatment is anti-inflammatory 
and has been shown to reduce cytokine levels.38
Some studies suggest that an increased low density 
lipoprotein cholesterol level itself might be beneficial 
in reducing mortality from respiratory diseases 
through direct anti-infectious properties, though mean 
low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were low in 
our population. Finally, we noted that early increases 
in procalcitonin levels were strongly associated with 
critical illness and mortality, although covid-19 
appears to be characterized by low procalcitonin levels 
in general. Though many patients with increased 
procalcitonin levels and critical illness were treated 
with antibiotics, it remains unclear whether these 
patients actually had bacterial disease or whether 
the increase in procalcitonin levels was another 
manifestation of a general hyperinflammatory state.
Last, we were interested to note that, while risk of 
hospital admission was constant across the study 
period, risk of critical illness (and directionally, but 
not significantly, mortality) decreased over time. Our 
institution was stretched but not overwhelmed by the 
epidemic and did not experience important equipment 
or treatment shortages. The improvement in outcomes

raises the possibility that familiarity with the disease, 
ongoing iteration of protocols and practices in response 
to observed outcomes, and initiation of new treatments 
might improve outcomes even in the absence of 
vaccination or regimens known to be effective.
Limitations of this study
This study has several limitations. Most important, 
data on patients who were not admitted to hospital 
were more limited because many did not have vital 
signs or blood samples collected and might not

are also a heterogeneous group, made even more 
heterogeneous by changing testing thresholds over 
time. We might therefore have overestimated the 
importance of chronic disease in risk of hospital 
admission. This limitation could be further 
exacerbated by the fact that patients treated and 
discharged from the emergency department were not 
commonly tested and thus omitted from our analysis 
unless later admitted to hospital, yet they might be 
more likely to have comorbidities than those tested 
in outpatient settings. However, a sensitivity analysis 
including these patients showed similar results. 
Our patients were all from a single geographic 
region, treated within a single health system; 
factors associated with poor outcomes might differ 
elsewhere, though our patient population is diverse. 
We did not have data on inflammatory markers 
available for patients not admitted to hospital; it is 
possible that these would have been associated with 
risk of hospital admission, not just critical illness, 
if available. Moreover, a standardized admission 
laboratory protocol was only established about 
two weeks into the epidemic, resulting in missing 
laboratory data for earlier patients, especially those 
who were less acutely ill. Finally, our outcome 
assignments might be imperfect: some patients in 
the group who were not admitted to hospital might 
have been admitted to other institutions, and some 
discharged patients might have been readmitted 
elsewhere with critical illness or could have died 
post-discharge.
Conclusion
Overall, we found that age and comorbidities are 
powerful predictors of requirement for admission to 
hospital rather than outpatient care; however, degree 
of oxygen impairment and markers of inflammation 
are most strongly associated with poor outcomes 
during hospital admission. Clinicians should consider 
routinely obtaining inflammatory markers during 
hospital stay for people with covid-19.
