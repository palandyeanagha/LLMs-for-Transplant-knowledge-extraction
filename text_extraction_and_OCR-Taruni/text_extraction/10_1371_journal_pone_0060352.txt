Abstract
In this study we have used multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) to measure the copy number of CFHR3
and CFHR1 in DNA samples from 238 individuals from the UK and 439 individuals from the HGDP-CEPH Human Genome
Diversity Cell Line Panel. We have then calculated the allele frequency and frequency of homozygosity for the copy number
polymorphism represented by the CFHR3/CFHR1 deletion. There was a highly significant difference between geographical
locations in both the allele frequency (X2 = 127.7, DF = 11, P-value = 4.97x10-22) and frequency of homozygosity (X2 = 142.3,
DF = 22, P-value = 1.33x10-19). The highest frequency for the deleted allele (54.7%) was seen in DNA samples from Nigeria
and the lowest (0%) in samples from South America and Japan. The observed frequencies in conjunction with the known
association of the deletion with AMD, SLE and IgA nephropathy is in keeping with differences in the prevalence of these
diseases in African and European Americans. This emphasises the importance of identifying copy number polymorphism in
disease.

Introduction
Complement genes within the RCA (Regulators of Comple￾ment Activation) cluster at chromosome 1q32 are arranged in
tandem within two groups [1]. In a centromeric 360 kb segment
lie the genes for factor H (CFH) (OMIM 134370) and five factor
H-related proteins – CFHR1 (OMIM 134371), CFHR2 (OMIM
600889), CFHR3 (OMIM 605336), CFHR4 (OMIM 605337) and
CFHR5 (OMIM 608593). Sequence analysis of this region shows
evidence of segmental duplications (SDs) resulting in a high degree
of sequence identity between CFH and the genes for the five factor
H related proteins [2–4]. SDs such as those seen in the RCA
cluster are frequently associated with genomic rearrangements [5].
These usually occur as a result of non-allelic homologous
recombination (NAHR) between SDs but can also be a result of
gene conversion and microhomology mediated end joining
(MMEJ) [6]. Genomic disorders at this locus have affected CFH
and the CFHRs in a number of ways. Deletions as a result of
NAHR lead to the loss of CFHR1, CFHR3 and CFHR4. Deletions
within genes, occurring through both NAHR and MMEJ, result in
the formation of hybrid genes (CFH/CFHR1, CFHR1/CFH, CFH/
CFHR3, CFHR3/CFHR1) associated with diseases such as atypical
haemolytic uraemic syndrome (aHUS) and membranoproliferative
glomerulonephritis (MPGN) [7–9]. Complete deficiency of factor
H related proteins 1 and 3 had been found to be occur in ,4% of
a European population in protein studies before DNA studies of
the region [10]. This DNA copy number polymorphism (CNP) has
been extensively characterised in health and disease. It has been
shown that the deletion is associated with the presence of factor H
autoantibodies in aHUS [11,12], with an increased risk of SLE
[13] and a decreased risk of age-related macular degeneration [14]
and IgA nephropathy [15,16]. That there might be differences in
the population frequency of the CFHR3/1 deletion was suggested
from a study published in 2006 which showed that the prevalence
of homozygous deletion in African populations was ,16% [17].
Population difference in the deletion have been confirmed in
subsequent studies [13,18,19]. In this study we have measured
copy number of CFHR3 and CFHR1 with multiplex ligation￾dependent probe amplification (MLPA) [20] in a range of
populations derived from the HGDP-CEPH Human Genome
Diversity Panel (http://www.cephb.fr/en/hgdp/diversity.php)
[21].
Methods
Ethics statement
Use of anonymous human DNA samples in this study was
approved by the Northern and Yorkshire Multi-Centre Research
Ethics Committee.
CFHR1 and CFHR3 copy number was measured in DNA samples
from 238 individuals from the UK and 439 individuals from the
HGDP-CEPH panel. The UK samples comprised 70 DNA samples
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 April 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 4 | e60352

from the Health Protection Agency Culture Collections (http://www.
hpacultures.org.uk/products/dna/hrcdna DNA), 10 samples ob￾tained from local blood donors and 158 DNA samples from control
individuals within the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium
[22,23]. The samples from the Health Protection Agency were
originally obtained from a control population of randomly selected,
non-related UK Caucasian blood donors. The full collection of
samples with the HGDP-CEPH panel consists of 1051 individuals
from 51 world populations (http://www.cephb.fr). We selected for
analysis 439 samples from 17 different countries comprising 25
different populations (Table 1). We did not include populations for
which data is either already available (for example European
populations such as France) or where samples numbers were too
small to be representative. There were still some populations with a
small number of samples, including the sub-Saharan region of
Africa. These were combined into 11 geographical locations
(Table 2) for subsequent analysis. In each of these locations the
number of samples was greater than 20. In total 133 samples from
African populations were analysed, including 83 from sub-Saharan
countries. CFHR1 and CFHR3 copy number was measured as
described previously [24] using multiplex ligation-dependent probe
amplification [20] (MLPA) using a kit from MRC Holland (www.
mlpa.com) (SALSA MLPA kit P236-A1 ARMD) and in house
probes.
Statistics
Chi-square analysis was used to test whether there was deviation
from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the geographical locations.
A p value of ,0.05 was considered to be not consistent with
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Chi-square analysis was undertaken
to determine whether there was a significant difference between
geographical locations in either the allele frequency of the
CFHR3/CFHR1 deletion, the genotype frequencies (del+ +/del+
2/del2 2) or the frequency (del+ +) of a homozygous deletion of
CFHR3/CFHR1. Fisher’s exact tests were undertaken to determine
whether in different geographical locations either the allele
frequency of the CFHR3/CFHR1 deletion, the genotype frequen￾cies (del++/del+2/del22) or the frequency of a homozygous
deletion of CFHR3/CFHR1 were significantly different to the
values for these variables in the UK population, or to their values
in all other populations combined.
Results
The allele frequency of the CFHR3/CFHR1 deletion in the
various geographical locations and the individual populations
within these locations is shown in Table 2. There was no deviation
from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in any of the geographical
locations. The CFHR3/CFHR1 deletion was not present in either
the South American or Japanese locations. The highest allele
frequency for the deletion was 54.7% in Nigeria. The deletion was

The CFHR3/CFHR1 deletion was not found in homozygosity in
Mexico, South America, China, Japan, Pakistan or Siberia. The
frequency of homozygous deletion was 3.4% in the UK, between
5–10% in Italy, Russia, North Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa, and
33.3% in Nigeria. Differences in genotype frequencies between
geographical locations were highly significant (X2= 142.3,

Discussion
In this study we have used multiplex ligation-dependent probe
amplification (MLPA) to determine the copy number of CFHR3
and CFHR1 in a variety of different geographical locations derived
from the HGDP-CEPH collection. MLPA has the advantage over
other techniques that have been used in that it provides a specific
determination of copy number. We measured copy number of
both CFHR3 and CFHR1 to determine the deleted allele frequency
because measurement of CFHR1 copy number alone is not specific
to this allele as it also occurs with the CFHR1/CFHR4 deletion
[24,25]. Using MLPA we have been able to determine both the
allele frequency of the deletion and the frequency of a homozygous
deletion. For statistical purposes we have set the UK population as
our reference. The value of 3.4% for the frequency of a
homozygous deletion in the UK population in this study is similar
to values that we have obtained in previous studies [11,24]
(Table 4) and the allele frequency of the deletion is similar to that
which we obtained on introduction of the MLPA assay (17.3% in
Moore et al [24]). The latter value is similar to the frequency of
18.3% that we have obtained in this study.
The values for the allele frequency of the deletion, the genotype
frequencies, and the frequency of a homozygous deletion that we
obtained for world-wide populations using the HGDP-CEPH
collection show marked population differences with the highest

frequencies being seen in African populations. The findings in the
African groups are consistent with those reported (Hageman et al
[17]) in African Americans and validate their findings in HGDP￾CEPH African samples which were based on a gene specific PCR
method that measured frequency of a homozygous deletion
Subsequently there have been several other studies documenting
the frequency of the CFHR3/CFHR1 deletion in a range of
populations. The results from these are shown in Table 4. The
values in this study for both allele frequency and the frequency of
homozygous deletion are consistent with previous studies partic￾ularly for the UK, Japanese, Chinese and Nigerian populations.
We chose in this study to combine several populations from sub￾saharan Africa as the numbers for each group were small.
However, the study of Sivakumaran et al [19] suggests that for this
region there are significant differences in the allele frequency of
the deleted allele between tribes. For instance, they found an allele
frequency of 23.8% in the Maasai tribe of Kenya compared to
42.3% in the Luhya. As can be seen in Table 2 we also observed
differences in the allele frequencies of the different populations
within this geographical location. For instance in the Biaka
pygmyies the allele frequency was 8.7% compared to 50% in the
Kenyan Bantus and Senegal Mandenka tribes. Recent studies
documenting the genetic variation in this region show evidence of
at least two different genetic groups derived from the North and
South of the Kalahari [26,27]. This may explain the differences in
the allele frequency that we have seen in sub-saharan Africa. It is
possible that ancestral African populations with a low allele
frequency of the deletion were the ones which participated in the
‘‘out of Africa’’ dispersal with the associated bottleneck reinforcing
the low allele frequency. That generally the current African
populations with a low allele frequency of the deletion are Hunter￾gatherers is compatible with this [28,29]. The high allele frequency
of the deletion in the African-American population is compatible
with the allele frequency seen in the Yoruba and Mandenka
[27,30].
How in evolution has this deletion arisen and how can the
population differences be explained? The alternative pathway of
complement is thought to be the oldest component of the innate
immune system [31]. The earliest components of the alternative
complement pathway to have been recognised are activators such
as C3 which has been identified in a coral [32] suggesting their
presence in the Cnidria. Regulatory components have been first
recognised in the Agnatha with for instance identification of a C3
cleaving short consensus repeat protein in lamprey [33]. A protein
(called SBP1) with a high degree of homology to human factor H
was first described in the teleost, sand bass [34,35]. Factor H has
also been identified in the zebrafish [36]. In the zebrafish, the
mouse and humans there are genes encoding SCR proteins with a
high degree of homology to factor H in close proximity to the gene
encoding factor H. In man there are the five factor H related
proteins (CFHR1-5), in the mouse there are three factor H related
proteins and in the zebrafish there are 4 factor H like proteins.
Sequence analysis of this region in man suggests that these genes
have arisen through a series of segmental duplication events [2].
Analysis of primate genomes undertaken by Sivakumaran et al
suggests that chimps have more extensive duplication in this region
than humans. The analysis also suggests that the duplications arose
in a common ancestor of the chimp and humans after divergence
from the orang-utan [19]. The duplicated segments predispose to
both non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) and gene
conversion [37]. The available evidence would suggest that the
CFHR3/CFHR1 deletion has arisen through NAHR after the
initial formation of the SDs. Sivakuram et al used phylogenetic
and linkage equilibrium analysis to determine the ancestral orgin
of the deletion [19] and found a single origin in Caucasians and
Asians but a recurrent origin in Africans. We believe that in
certain populations that the deletion has resulted in an evolution￾ary benefit. There is evidence to suggest that polymorphisms in
complement proteins are associated with susceptibility to infection
[38]. For instance mannose-binding lectin (MBL) binds to
microbes and activates the lectin pathway. Allelic variants in the
gene (MBL2) encoding this protein are associated with differences
in both the serum level and function of MBL. The frequency of
these allelic variants differs in populations; and the same variants
are associated with a differential risk of pneumococcal disease and
leprosy. Recently it has been shown that variants in CFH and
CFHR3 are associated with susceptibility to meningococcal disease
[39]. These observations taken with the knowledge that comple￾ment plays a significant role in the pathogenesis other diseases
such as malaria [40] would suggest that infection has driven the
geographical variability seen in complement variants such as the
CFHR3/1 deletion.
Since the CFHR3/CFHR1 deletion was first described a number
of studies have documented strong linkage disequilibrium of the
deletion with common CFH haplotypes [41,42]. In some
populations the deletion is present on haplotypes H1-5 and absent
on H6-7 [41]. In other populations the H2 haplotype perfectly tags
the deletion [15]. Likewise in some populations individual SNPs
have been shown to be in complete LD with the deletion. Zhao
et al found that the deletion was in complete LD with rs6677604
in European Americans but not in African Americans (r2= 0.60).
Whether the deletion confers an independent risk for AMD, SLE
and IgA nephropathy or is simply associated with protective/at￾risk haplotypes is an area of controversy [19,41,43]. However,
factor H related protein 1 blocks the C5 convertase but binds, in
competition with factor H, to host surfaces through its C-terminal
regulatory domain [44]. We are, therefore, of the opinion that
deletion of CFHR1 has a dual effect with reduced inhibition of
terminal complement pathway activity but increased regulation by
factor H of the alternative pathway. This may also explain why in
some diseases (AMD and IgA nephropathy) the deletion is
protective whilst in other others (SLE) it is associated with
increased risk.
It is also possible that CFHR3 has functional activity that
contributes to the disease association seen with the CFHR3/1
deletion. In African Americans with a higher frequency of the
deletion the prevalence of AMD and IgA nephropathy is lower
than in European Americans [45,46] whereas the prevalence of
SLE is higher [47]. Thus studying the population frequency of
disease associated CNPs such as the CFHR3/CFHR1 deletion
provides novel insights into the pathogenesis of such diseases.
However, at an individual level we do not think that screening for
the deletion in the normal population is currently of any clinical
benefit.
