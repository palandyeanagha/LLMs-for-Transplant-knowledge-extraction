Abstract
Background: Circulating microRNAs are stably detectable in serum/plasma and other body fluids. In patients with acute
kidney injury on dialysis therapy changes of miRNA patterns had been detected. It remains unclear if and how the dialysis
procedure itself affects circulating microRNA level.
Methods: We quantified miR-21 and miR-210 by quantitative RT-PCR in plasma of patients with acute kidney injury
requiring dialysis and measured pre- and post-dialyser miRNA levels as well as their amount in the collected spent dialysate.
Single treatments using the following filters were studied: F60 S (1.3 m2
, Molecular Weight Cut Off (MWCO): 30 kDa, n = 8),
AV 1000 S (1.8 m2
, MWCO: 30 kDa, n = 6) and EMiC 2 (1.8 m2
, MWCO: 40 kDa, n = 6).
Results: Circulating levels of miR-21 or -210 do not differ between pre- and post-dialyzer blood samples independently of
the used filter surface and pore size: miR-21: F60S: p = 0.35, AV 1000 S p = 1.0, EMiC2 p = 1.0; miR-210: F60S: p = 0.91, AV
1000 S p = 0.09, EMiC2 p = 0.31. Correspondingly, only traces of both miRNAs could be found in the collected spent
dialysate and ultrafiltrate.
Conclusions: In patients with acute kidney injury circulating microRNAs are not removed by dialysis. As only traces of miR￾21 and -210 are detected in dialysate and ultrafiltrate, microRNAs in the circulation are likely to be transported by larger
structures such as proteins and/or microvesicles. As miRNAs are not affected by dialysis they might be more robust
biomarkers of acute kidney injury.

Introduction
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of endogenous small
noncoding RNAs. The single-stranded molecules have a length
of 19–23 nt [1]. Gain and loss of function studies revealed that
miRNAs play a critical role in the regulation of basically all
biological cell functions such as proliferation, differentiation and
apoptosis [2–8]. MiRNAs are also involved in pathologic pathways
of many disease models [6,9]. Recent studies discovered that
miRNAs are detectable in extracellular human body fluids such as
blood or urine in a rather stable form [10–12].
A potential reason that circulating miRNAs are not degraded by
RNAses, is that they are partly included in microvesicles, such as
exosomes or bound to protein complexes such as argonaute
protein 2 (Ago 2) [13]. Especially in the intensive care unit there is
a wide range of filters used for hemodialysis of patients with acute
kidney injury. Dialysis membranes do usually not allow passage of
larger molecules (.30–40 kDa). However, the dialysis procedure
itself might influence the amount of circulating miRNAs. In the
present study we therefore analyzed the effect of hemodialysis on
circulating miRNA levels in blood and collected spent dialysate in
order to investigate, whether the procedure removes miRNAs
from circulation. Dialysis membranes of varying pore sizes (degree
of molecular weight cut off) were compared.
Materials and Methods
Patients and Dialysis unit
The study protocol was approved by the Hannover Medical
School Ethics Committee and conducted in accordance with the
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 June 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 6 | e38269

German Federal Guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki. Part
of this represents a secondary analysis of samples collected for a
study published elsewere [14]. Fourteen patients with acute kidney
injury (AKI) treated by slow extended daily dialysis (SLEDD) were
included (see table 1), using the GENIUSTM dialysis system
(Fresenius Medical Care, Bad Homburg, Germany). Its technical
details are described elsewhere [15]. In brief, sterile bicarbonate
dialysate is filled into a 75- or 90-L tank and is then circulated in a
closed loop circuit. During dialysis, fresh dialysate is taken from
the top of the tank, whereas the spent dialysate flows back to the
bottom. Eight patients of the collective were treated only with the
regularly used filter system (polysulfone high-flux dialyzer (F60S),
1.3 m2 effective surface area, inner lumen 200 mm, wall thickness
40 mm, Fresenius Medical Care, Molecular weight cut off
(MWCO): 30 kDa). Two of them received a second dialysis
session at a later point in time which let us classify these results as
an independent event. For further validation we recruited six more
patients that received a dialysis session with two other different
filter systems. The EmiC 2 (1.8 m2 effective surface area, inner
lumen 220 mm, wall thickness 35 mm, polysulfone, Fresenius
Medical Care) has an enhanced middle molecule clearance and
therefore among other things a higher MWCO of 40 kDa. We
tested whether a larger pore size might result in depletion of
circulating miRNAs. The AV 1000 S dialysis filter system
(Fresenius Medical Care) effective surface area 1.8 m2
, inner
lumen 220 mm, wall thickness 35 mm; allowing elimination of
substances with a molecular weight of up to 30 kDa. The dialysate
and countercurrent blood flow ranged between 150 to 165 mL/
min in all dialysis sessions. Samples from pre-dialyser and post￾dialyser blood line directly before and after the dialysis filter were
collected 30 minutes after starting the dialysis session. Spent
dialysate and ultrafiltrate samples were collected after the end of
treatment (Duration: 490 min (480 min to 630 min)). The system,
dialyser and sampling ports are described in figure 1.
RNA Isolation
RNA isolation was performed with plasma, ultrafiltrate and
dialysate samples by using the MasterPure RNA Purification kit
(Epicenter Technologies) according to the instructions of the
manufacturer. In addition, we supplemented the samples with
1 mL of 3 fmol/mL Caenorhabditis elegans miR-39 (cel_miR-39) to
normalize results.
Detection and Quantification of miRNAs
Isolated RNA was reverse transcribed with hsa_mir-21,
hsa_miR-210 and cel_miR-39 primers using the TaqMan
microRNA Reverse Transcription kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, CA) according to the manufacturers advices. Then both
miRNAs were detected and validated by quantitative real-time
PCR (qRT-PCR) via TaqMan MicroRNA Assays (Applied
Biosystems). Levels of circulating miRNA were normalized to
cel_miR-39 which was spiked in as external control.
Statistical Analysis
All statistics were performed with Graph Pad Prism 4. A
nonparametric two-tailed Mann-Whitney test was used for
statistical analysis of two groups. Data are represented as median
and lower and upper quartile, if not described differently.
Results
Patients with acute kidney injury undergoing SLEDD using a
F60S filter, we did not identify any effect of the dialysis procedure
on circulating miRNA-21 and -210 levels comparing pre-dialyser
and post-dialyser blood samples (miR-21: p = 0.35; miR-210:
p = 0.91 (Figure 2A)). In line with this only traces of miR-21 and
miRNA-210 could be found in both, dialysate and ultrafiltrate
(miR-21: Dialysate: 1.661026 (3.061027 to 2.861026
), ultrafil￾trate: 1.361026 (3.461027 to 2.461026
); miR-210: dialysate:
1.061027 (2.861028 to 4.561027
), ultrafiltrate: 8.361028
(3.061028 to 2.161027
)). Also there was no difference between
dialysate and ultrafiltrate (miR-21: p = 0.80; miR-210: p = 0.74
(Figure 2A)). As shown in Figure 2B miRNA values in blood within
the F60S system for miR-21 and miR-210 were significantly
higher than in dialysate/ultrafiltrate (p,0.0001) suggesting only
minimal passage of miRNAs throughout the dialyser membrane.
Also dialysers with a larger surface area and pore size (Fresenius
AV 1000 S 1.8 m2 (MWCO: 30 kDa), EMiC 2 1.8 m2 (MWCO:
40 kDa)) had no significant effect on circulating miRNA levels
(miR-21: AV1000S pre-dialyser vs. EMiC 2 pre-dialyser p = 0.59,
post-dialyser p = 0.70, dialysate p = 0.94, ultrafiltrate p = 0.39;
miR-210: pre-dialyser p = 0.02, post-dialyser p = 0.82, dialysate
p = 0.59, ultrafiltrate p = 0.31) (figure 3). The significant difference
between the pre-dialyser line of AV 1000 S versus EMiC2 in
miRNA-210 levels cannot be caused by different filter properties
and is therefore not relevant for our main conclusion.
Also, the difference of miRNA-21 and -210 levels in blood
versus spent dialysate levels using the EmiC 2 or AV 1000 S filter
showed similar results for both miRNAs as previously shown for
the F60S dialyser (p,0.0001; data not shown). Difference in miR￾21 and -210 depletion ratios between the predialyser blood line
and spent dialysate for AV 1000 S (miR-21: 2.261023 (3.661024

p = 0.70; miR-210: p = 0.31 (data not shown)). This implicates that
the different filter properties does not significantly alter circulating
levels of at least miRNA-21 and -210.
Anticoagulation with heparin had no effect on the detectable
miRNA levels in this study. Neither miR-21 (non-heparin treated
pre-dialyser vs. heparin treated pre-dialyser p = 0.49, post-dialyser
p = 1.00) nor miR-210 (non-heparin treated pre-dialyser vs.
heparin treated pre-dialyser p = 0.19, post-dialyser p = 0.98)
showed a significant difference in the entire patient collective
between heparin treated and non heparin treated group.
Discussion
This is the first study, which describes the influence of
hemodialysis therapy on circulating miRNA levels in patients
with AKI. The salient finding is that miRNA, although only small
in size, are not removed by various dialyser membranes, even
those designed to remove middle-sized molecules.
MiRNAs interfere with a variety of pathologic pathways
[6,16,17]. MiRNA-21 is a crucial player in various disease models
such as cancer, heart failure or fibrosis in heart, lung or kidney
[8,18–23]. Furthermore published evidence implicates that miR￾21 is important in immune cell development and function [24,25].
Patient number 6 showed relatively high values of circulating
miRNAs. Interestingly, this patient was involved in complex
disease processes such as hepatitis B and C co-infection which led
to liver transplantation. It is possible that these circumstances
induced high levels of circulating miR-21. In fact there is a
growing body of evidence that this miRNA is elevated in the
circulation of patients with hepatitis C and therefore might be a
potential biomarker [26]. MiR-210 has beenshown to be involved
in kidney disease such as T-cell mediated rejection or clear cell
carcinoma [16,27]. Furthermore it is a strong predictor of survival
in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury in plasma [9,16].
Recent studies suggest that circulating miRNAs in general
might have biosignaling functions and are transported by
microvesicles and/or proteins [12,28,29]. Therefore we hypoth￾esized that a dialysis procedure could remove miRNAs at least
partially from blood, which lead to altered circulating levels of
these small ribonucleotides of the circulation. This might have
biological consequences. Surprisingly, we could not find a
significant alteration of miRNAs in plasma after passing the
dialysis filters. This leads to the conclusion that dialysis therapy
does not deplete patient’s blood of possibly biologically active
miRNAs in the circulation. However, small amounts of miRNAs
were detectable in the ultrafiltrate as well as in spent dialysate
Figure 1. Structure and function of the Genius 75/90 Dialysis System and sample collection. Patient’s blood runs countercurrent to
dialysate and enters the dialysis circuit from a Shaldon catheter. The ‘‘arterial’’, i.e. predialyser blood line (red) passes the filter and blood flows back to
the patient via the ‘‘venous’’, i.e. post-dialyser blood line (blue). Fresh dialysate is prepared individually for every patient’s conditions and stored in a
75 or 90 liter tank. A tube leads the fresh dialysate (light-blue) to the dialysis filter. Exchange of substances and filtration is mediated by an osmotic
and pressure gradient and is supported by counter-flow principle. Spent dialysate (grey) flows through the outlet dialysate line back into the tank.
Phase formation prevents the mixture of fresh and spent dialysate. An ultrafiltration pump transports the excess filtrate and maintains the pressure
gradient of the system. Samples are taken at the marked locations.

suggesting that a small portion of miRNAs in the blood is
transported by very small structures or as a free unbound form.
There are several possibilities of stabilizing circulating miRNAs
in the blood; two main transporter systems have been identified.
MiRNAs are transported in microvesicles and/or exosomes,
apoptotic bodies and other microparticles [30]. In addition
miRNAs are transported by non-vesicle associated protein and
lipoprotein complexes [13]. Turchinovich et al. showed that the
majority of circulating miRNAs are bound to a molecular family
called argonaute proteins [31]. Especially Ago 2, a 97 kDa
member of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), is the
most frequent miRNA carrier [32]. Furthermore, this group
suggests that other transport forms such as exosomes may play
only a minor role and more than 97% of the miRNAs are not
exosome-associated [31]. However our study only permits the
conclusion that miRNAs must be mainly transported by RNA￾binding proteins (.30–40 kDa), microvesicles and/or other
structures larger than 30–40 kDa.
Previous studies demonstrated unbound/naked miRNAs not to
be protected against the endogenous RNAses in the extracellular
fluids and may therefore be very unstable [13]. That makes it
implausible that the detectable traces of miR-21 and -210 in
ultrafiltrate and dialysate are not accompanied by stabilizing
factors. Recent investigations describe two RNA-binding proteins
that possibly could be candidates for this passage, namely
nucleophosmin 1 (NPM 1) and dead end 1 (Dnd 1) [33]. As
shown in figure 4 NPM 1 and Dnd 1 are the only known miRNA￾carriers which are small enough to permeate at least the EMiC2
filter. Here it should be noted that filter-characteristics depend on
pressure differences between the blood and effluent circuit.
Because of this slight pressure dependent shift of the sieving
coefficient curves towards a little higher molecular weight cut offs,
it could be possible that very small exosomes might pass the
dialyser as well. All other known transport forms such as Low and
High density protein (LDL/HDL), microvesicles or even Ago 2 are
too large to penetrate the membrane effectively. Thus, these
structures are likely the major transporters of miRNAs. A recent
study in chronic hemodialysis patients suggested that levels of
miR-499 are in fact eliminated by hemodialysis [34]. This finding
thus runs contradictory to the results presented here. In order for
miRNAs to be eliminated by hemodialysis they have to be either
bound to very small molecules or circulate unbound in blood. The
study by Mitchell and coworkers suggests that ‘‘naked’’ (i.e.
unbound) miRNAs are degraded within less than 2 minutes after
addition to human plasma [11]. In addition, as figure 4 suggests
only Dnd1 or NPM1 are able to pass the EMIC2 filter system.
Based on this we do not believe that circulating miRNAs can be
altered by the hemodialysis procedure. Thus, an alteration of miR￾499 levels in chronic hemodialyis patients might rather be due to
other factors (i.e. degradation). However, different miRNAs have
been shown to be transported by varying means [35]. The
mirRNA let-7a was shown to be mainly detected in microvesicles,
Figure 2. Levels of circulating miR-21 and -210 in different sample types with the F60S dialysate filter. Ten independent dialysis
sessions in eight different patients were analyzed for the F60S filter system. MiR-21 and miR-210 levels are not significantly different between pre￾dialyser and corresponding post-dialyser blood lines (miR-21: p = 0.35; miR-210: p = 0.91). Also the difference between spent dialysate and ultrafiltrate
is not of statistical significance (miR-21: p = 0.80; miR-210: p = 0.74). However, averaged values of blood side versus spent dialysate reached high
statistical significance for both microRNAs with p-values of ,0.0001. Data are represented as mean and standard error of the mean.

while others were associated with Ago2 (e.g. miR-16 and miR-92a)
[35]. Thus, miRNA packaging into microvesicles or RNA binding
proteins likely follows a cell type-specific expression and/or release
pattern. It is therefore conceivable that miR-499 is subjected to
different kinetics. In pre-dialysis patients with chronic kidney
disease the levels of circulating miRNAs have been shown to be
Figure 3. Comparison of influence of two different filter properties on circulating microRNA levels. Six patients received at least one
dialysis session with each of the two filter systems AV 1000 S and EMiC 2. Circulating levels of miR-21 and -210 were not differently altered by the two
different dialyser properties. (miR-21: AV1000S pre-dialyser vs. EMiC 2 predialyser p = 0.59, post-dialyser p = 0.70, dialysate p = 0.94, ultrafiltrate
p = 0.39; miR-210: pre-dialyser p = 0.02, post-dialyser p = 0.82, dialysate p = 0.59, ultrafiltrate p = 0.31) Only pre-dialyser line showed a significant
alteration, which is not of relevance for our main conclusion. Data are represented as mean and standard error of the mean.

reduced suggesting altered miRNAs kinetics depending on renal
function [36]. However, our results suggest that the hemodialysis
technique as such does not influence levels of circulating miRNAs.
Based on our results we concluded, that: (I) miRNAs are likely
to be carried and stabilized by larger structures (e.g. RNA-binding
proteins and or microvesicles) (II) These structures must have a
molecular weight not less than 30 respectively 40 kDa and (III) a
small but detectable amount of miRNAs is carried in smaller
structures with a kDa of less than 30 or is freely available in the
blood.
