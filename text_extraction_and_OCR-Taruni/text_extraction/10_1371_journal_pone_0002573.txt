Abstract
Background: The combination of transaminases (ALT), biopsy, HBeAg and viral load have classically defined the inactive
status of carriers of chronic hepatitis B. The use of FibroTest (FT) and ActiTest (AT), biomarkers of fibrosis and
necroinflammatory activity, has been previously validated as alternatives to biopsy. We compared the 4-year prognostic
value of combining FT-AT and viral load for a better definition of the inactive carrier status.
Methods and Findings: 1,300 consecutive CHB patients who had been prospectively followed since 2001 were pre￾included. The main endpoint was the absence of liver-related complications, transplantation or death. We used the
manufacturers’ definitions of normal FT (, = 0.27), normal AT (, = 0.29) and 3 standard classes for viral load. The adjustment
factors were age, sex, HBeAg, ethnic origin, alcohol consumption, HIV-Delta-HCV co-infections and treatment.
Results: 1,074 patients with baseline FT-AT and viral load were included: 41 years old, 47% African, 27% Asian, 26%
Caucasian. At 4 years follow-up, 50 complications occurred (survival without complications 93.4%), 36 deaths occurred
(survival 95.0%), including 27 related to HBV (survival 96.1%). The prognostic value of FT was higher than those of viral load
or ALT when compared using area under the ROC curves [0.89 (95%CI 0.84–0.93) vs 0.64 (0.55–0.71) vs 0.53 (0.46–0.60) all
P,0.001], survival curves and multivariate Cox model [regression coefficient 5.2 (3.5–6.9; P,0.001) vs 0.53 (0.15–0.92;
P = 0.007) vs 20.001 (20.00320.000;P = 0.052)] respectively. A new definition of inactive carriers was proposed with an
algorithm combining ‘‘zero’’ scores for FT-AT (F0 and A0) and viral load classes. This new algorithm provides a 100%
negative predictive value for the prediction of liver related complications or death. Among the 275 patients with the classic
definition of inactive carrier, 62 (23%) had fibrosis presumed with FT, and 3 died or had complications at 4 year.
Conclusion: In patients with chronic hepatitis B, a combination of FibroTest-ActiTest and viral load testing accurately
defined the prognosis and the inactive carrier status.

Introduction
Finding the best method to evaluate and manage patients
infected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) continues to be a
challenge [1–3]. The combination of liver biopsy, transaminases
(ALT), HBeAg and viral load have classically defined the different
statuses of HBV carriers, which are used for patient’ management
[1–4]. This classical definition has limitations related to limitations
of these four factors themselves. Furthermore, there is a consensus
about the importance of these factors as independent prognostic
factors [3], but evidence based data are lacking for their
independent prognostic weights. In a recent well-detailed
overview, there was not a single longitudinal study that assessed
these factors together [3]. Only three longitudinal studies have
analyzed the prognostic value of baseline liver fibrosis and activity
in 755 patients, but without baseline viral load assessment [5,6,7].
Liver biopsy for determining disease grade and stage has
limitations (sampling error and observer error) and risks [8], which
probably explained the small number of studies with baseline and
follow-up biopsies. The appropriateness of repeating biopsy is
increasingly questionable, as accurate non-invasive markers have
been now validated [8,9,10].
Transaminases [4], HBeAg presence or seroconversion and
viral load [2,4,11,12], are poor predictors of the severity of liver

features, including fibrosis stage and activity grade. Cirrhosis
complications, including hepatocellular carcinoma, often occur in
patients with HBeAg seroconversion, HBV DNA levels less than
104 copies/ml, or ALT levels between 0.5 and 2 times the upper
limit of normal [2]. Therefore, these ‘‘classical’’ criteria are
controversial for their influence on therapeutic decisions by
clinicians managing HBV carriers, without any assessment of
fibrosis stage and activity [2,4].
Validated noninvasive alternatives to liver biopsy in patients
infected with HBV [10] include two combinations of simple serum
biochemical markers: FibroTest (FT) (Biopredictive) for the
assessment of fibrosis, and ActiTest (AT) (Biopredictive) for the
assessment of necroinflammatory activity [13–16]. With biopsy as
the standard of reference, the diagnostic value of FT for the
diagnosis of significant fibrosis (bridging fibrosis), as estimated by
the area under the receiver operating characteristics curves
(AUROC) in 1,457 patients, is 0.77 (95%CI 0.74 to 0.81) and
0.80 (0.77–0.84) when standardized according to the prevalence of
fibrosis stages defining advanced and non advanced fibrosis [17],
with better accuracies than ALT [10,13–16].
Because liver biopsy is an imperfect gold standard
[18,19,20,21], discordances between FT and biopsy may be
related to FT failure and also to biopsy failure. False-positive and
false-negative FT results are mainly related to Gilbert syndrome,
hemolysis, or acute inflammation [20,21,22]. Biomarkers have
shown similar or lower error rates than small liver biopsies [20,21]
in patients with chronic hepatitis C. To be useful as alternatives to
liver biopsy, noninvasive biomarkers must also demonstrate
prognostic value based on hard clinical endpoints: liver disease￾related mortality and severe hepatic complications. This has been
performed for FT-AT in patients with chronic hepatitis C [21].
The aim of the present study was to similarly validate the
prognostic value of FT-AT in patients infected with HBV and to
use these non-invasive markers for a simpler definition of HBV
inactive carrier status. For these purposes we compared the 4-year
prognostic value of combining FT-AT and viral load versus the
classic definitions.
Methods
We hypothesized a) that FT and AT together will help to better
define the prognosis of patients with chronic hepatitis B in
comparison with viral load, transaminases (ALT) and HBeAg
status; b) that the prognostic value of FT will be similar than that
of liver biopsy and c) that a combination of FT-AT with viral load
will help to better define the status of inactive (‘‘healthy’’) carrier
versus active carrier.
Patients
Study patients belonged to a prospective hospital-based cohort
of 1,300 patients with chronic hepatitis B infection, seen at our
institution from November 2001 to December 2006. For the
analysis we identified a ‘‘retrospective’’ subgroup of patients who
had been previously studied at our institution before November
2001 and for whom the data was retrospectively gathered.
Inclusion criteria were patients with HBsAg positive for at least 6
months, with an assessment of liver histology done with FT-AT
measured in fresh serum and an assessment of viral load performed
in the same week. Patients had been referred by general
practitioners, private specialists, or public general hospitals, for
the staging and treatment of hepatitis B infection. Most patients
(91.5%) had no severe complications, and the disease had been
discovered by the detection of HBsAg. Liver biopsy was not
indicated for all patients. All patients received FT unless the patient
refused, or the hospital laboratory was unable to perform the FT.
Exclusion criteria were patients with missing FT or viral load, or
more than one week between FT and viral load assessments.
Follow-up of patients was performed every 6 months, and FT￾AT, viral load or biopsy was repeated as deemed necessary by the
physician in charge.
All procedures were followed in accordance with the current
revision of the declaration of Helsinki, approved as a non￾interventional study by the ethical committee of Groupe
Hospitalier Pitie´ Salpeˆtrie`re and all participants gave verbal
informed consent. According the French law, in non-interven￾tional study the signed informed consent is not mandatory. Biopsy
was performed for routine management of chronic HBV infection
and was not related to the study protocol. Consenting patients
underwent FT testing if biochemistry unit personnel were
available to perform the test and were blinded to the clinical data.
Biomarkers
FT is a noninvasive blood test that combines the quantitative
results of 6 serum biochemical markers, [alpha2-macroglobulin,
haptoglobin, gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), total biliru￾bin, apolipoprotein A1 and alanine amino transferase (ALT)] with
patient age and sex data in a patented artificial intelligence
algorithm (USPTO 6,631,330) to generate a measure of fibrosis
and necroinflammatory activity in the liver [10]. This method
provides a numerical quantitative estimate of liver fibrosis ranging
from 0.00 to 1.00, corresponding to the METAVIR scoring
system. The FT cutoffs for presumed fibrosis stages were ,0.27
METAVIR stage F0, 0.27–0.31 stage F1 (portal fibrosis), 0.32–
0.47 (F1–F2), 0.48–0.58 (F2 bridging fibrosis), 0.59–0.73 (F3 many
septa) and .0.73 cirrhosis (F4). An algorithm has been suggested
that would classify patients into 3 groups: no or minimal fibrosis
(FT between 0–0.31), moderate fibrosis (FT between 0.31–0.58),
and severe fibrosis (FT between 0.58–1.00) [10].
We measured GGT, ALT, AST, and total bilirubin, with a
Hitachi 917 Analyzer and Roche Diagnostics reagents; alpha2-
macroglobulin, apolipoprotein A1, and haptoglobin were mea￾sured with a BNII (Dade Behring). Personnel blinded to all patient
characteristics, including biopsy results, performed all the tests. All
the analytical studies, including intra- and interobservers and
reproducibility studies, were performed independent of the present
study, with CVs ,10%, and have been reported previously
[10,22]. There is no perfect definition of normal upper limit for
ALT [23–24]. Therefore we used the median value 50 IU/L [23]
and a more restricted definition at 0.5 times the upper limit that is
25 IU/L as suggested by Lai et al [2].
Viral load
Blood samples taken at each study visit were subjected to
virological analysis without knowledge of the clinical data. Almost
all samples were quantified in a single center (GHPS virology
department). Only 16/1074 (1.5%) samples were analyzed in
another laboratory. HBV serological markers (HBeAg, anti-HBe
antibody) were determined using Axsym Abbott’s test (Abbott, Les
Ulis, FRANCE). From December 2001 to June 2006, serum HBV
DNA was measured by PCR using HBV Monitor Cobas (Roche,
Meylan, France) with a lower limit of detection of 200 copies/mL.
Since June 2006, all samples have been quantified using Cobas
Ampliprep Taqman (Roche, Meylan, France) with a lower limit of
detection of 12 IU/mL. All HBV viral load quantification units
were transformed to International Units according to the
manufacturer’s specification, i.e. 1 IU/mL equals 5.26 copies/
mL as determined with Cobas Monitor.

Liver biopsy
Liver biopsies were processed with standard techniques. A single
pathologist (F.C.), who was unaware of the biochemical markers,
evaluated the fibrosis stage and activity grade according to the
METAVIR scoring system [25]. Fibrosis was staged on a scale of 0
to 4: F0 = no fibrosis, F1 = portal fibrosis without septa, F2 = few
septa, F3 = numerous septa without cirrhosis, F4 = cirrhosis.
Survival analysis
The prognostic factors were estimated and compared using
survival curves, the area under the prognostic ROC curves and
multivariate analysis.
Endpoints. Only prospective events were analyzed in the main
survival analysis. The 4-year survival without HBV-related cirrhosis
or liver disease-related complications was the a priori main end-point
used to compare the prognostic value of FT versus other biomarkers
and histological staging. These complications were defined as: death,
liver transplantation, decompensation, variceal bleeding, or
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), Decompensation was determined
by the presence of ascites, hepatic encephalopathy or jaundice (total
bilirubin .51 mmol/L). Ascites was deemed to be present when
ascitic fluid was confirmed by paracentesis and/or abdominal
imaging. HCC was diagnosed by histological examination of liver
tissue obtained by liver biopsy, or at autopsy, or if one or more
hepatic space–occupying lesions observed at ultrasonography or
computed tomography were shown to have vascular patterns typical
of HCC by angiography, dual-phase spiral tomography, or magnetic
resonance imaging. Variceal bleeding was diagnosed on the basis of
endoscopic findings in patients presenting with upper gastrointestinal
hemorrhage. Two secondary endpoints were death related to HBV
and the overall survival regardless of the cause of death.
Survival time. The survival time was calculated from the date
of FT to the endpoint date. This interval was censored at 4 years, or
if shorter, at the time of last follow-up. For decompensated patients
at baseline, only complications occurring during follow-up were
taken into account. When several complications occurred, the first
one was considered. Each year, for patients who had not been seen
at our hospital in the previous 12 months, we found out whether
they were living and if not, the date and the cause of death. For
patients who were still alive, we either interviewed the patients or
obtained information through their physicians. For deceased
patients who died outside our hospital, we obtained information
about the date and cause of death from their physicians or family. If
we could not obtain information on the patient, we sent a letter to
the city of their birth in order to find out if they were still living and,
if not, the date of death.
Prognostic factors. The prognostic value of the biomarkers of
liver injury (FT for fibrosis, AT or ALT for activity), and of the
previously established seven ‘‘important’’ prognostic factors [3]: three
host factors (age, gender, ethnic origin), three virus-related (viral load,
HBeAg, coinfection) and one environmental factor (heavy alcohol
consumption of 50 g or more per day) were assessed in univariate and
multivariate analyses to identify the best combination.
Classification of patients. We compared survival of patients
classified according to three methods: the baseline usual cutoffs for
FT, viral load and ALT, the classical definitions of HBV carriers and
the best combination of prognostic factors derived from analyses.
For FT, the previously recommended classification of patients
with both hepatitis B and hepatitis C into 3 classes was used
[10,21]: severe (.0.58), intermediate (0.32–0.58) and minimal
fibrosis (,0.32). ALT serum activity has been classified [2,23] in
three classes: elevated (50 IU/L or greater), low (25–49 IU/L) and
very low (,25 IU/L). The viral load has been classified [1] in
three classes: high (.20,000 IU/ml or 105 copies/ml), interme￾diate (2000–20,000 IU/ml or 104
–105 copies/ml) and low
(,2000 IU/ml or 104 copies/ml).
The following ‘‘classical’’ definition of HBV carriers was used
[1,3]: 1) Immune tolerance phase: HBeAg positive with high viral
load and persistently normal ALT. 2) Immune clearance phase:
HBeAg positive with high viral load and elevated ALT. 3) Inactive
carrier phase: HBeAg negative, anti-HBe positive, persistently
normal ALT. 4) Reactivation phase: HBeAg negative, anti-HBe
positive, intermediate or high viral load and elevated ALT.
According to the multivariate analysis, the following new
simplified classification was retrospectively assessed: 1) Immune
tolerance phase: HBeAg positive with high viral load and normal
FT-AT (A0F0). 2) Active phase: HBeAg positive or anti-HBe
positive, whatever the viral load, and elevated FT-AT. 3) Inactive
carrier phase: HBeAg negative, anti-HBe positive, low or
intermediate viral load and normal FT-AT.
The FT prognostic value was compared with that of
simultaneous baseline biopsies. We retrospectively compared FT
with two other indexes: the classical Child-Pugh score [26], and
the APRI index [27].
Statistical methods
We used the chi-square test for qualitative comparisons, the
Mann-Whitney test for quantitative comparisons [28], time￾dependent Kaplan-Meier analysis for survival curves, and the
log-rank test and Cox proportional hazard model for multivariate
analysis [28]. We checked the assumption of proportional hazards
by plotting the scaled Schoenfeld residuals [28].
We compared patient survival with the expected survival in the
French population, matched for age, sex, and follow-up period.
The survival curve of the French population was calculated on the
basis of age, sex, and follow-up period and conditional
probabilities of death, from official, published census tables [29].
For each patient, beginning from the date of FT assessment, we
used the Ederer II method to calculate a yearly predicted
cumulative survival rate from a person of the same age and sex
having a similar period of follow-up; we used the Z-test for
comparisons between actual and predicted survivals [30] to
compare the prognostic values of FT and fibrosis staging. FT
data, as well as other score values, were entered as continuous
variables. We calculated AUROCs with an empirical nonpara￾metric method according to Delong et al [31], or the binormal
method if the sample size of the endpoint was ,30 [32], and hen
compared results with the method of Zhou et al [33]. We used 2-
sided statistical tests for all analyses; a p-value of #0.05 was
considered significant. We used Number Cruncher Statistical
Systems 2003 software (NCSS, Kaysville, UT, USA) for all
analyses [28].
Sensitivity analyses
Survival analyses were repeated: after exclusion of patients 1)
with FT high-risk profiles of false positives/negatives as identified
by security algorithms [20] 2) with clinically obvious cirrhosis.
Analyses were also performed according to gender and BMI, in
the subgroup of patients without coinfection with Delta, HIV or
HCV, and in patients with normal baseline ALT. ‘‘Clinically
obvious cirrhosis’’ was defined as a patient with decompensated
cirrhosis or with the association of at least two of the following
classical signs of cirrhosis: platelets less than 100,000, prothrombin
time less than 70%, atrophy of the liver or splenomegaly on
ultrasonography, or large varices on endoscopy. The prognostic
value of FT was compared with that of elastography (FibroscanH)
when simultaneously performed.

Results
Patients
Of the 1,300 patients seen during the study period, 1074 (83%)
were included and 226 were non-included (17%) (Table 1).
Compared to non-included patients, those included were more
often female and less often Caucasian, and has less severe disease
(less HIV coinfection, death, less or complications), less HBeAg
positive, fewer biopsies, and had received more treatment with anti
viral drugs. A total of 9,169 ALT measurements have been
performed in included and 1,310 in non-included patients.
Survivals
Among the 1,074 included patients with baseline FT-AT and
viral loads, the mean follow-up was 7.7 years (2.5 years prospective
and 5.2 retrospective); after 4 years of prospective follow-up, 50
complications occurred (survival without complications 93.4%), and
36 deaths (survival 95.0%), including 27 related to HBV (survival
96.1%) (Table 2, Table 3). The number of patients still at risk in the
prospective follow-up was 655 at 2 years, and 242 at 4 years.
Biomarkers and viral load
A total of 2,573 FT-AT and 1,597 viral load tests were assessed;
biopsy was performed at least once in 505 patients, and at baseline
simultaneously with viral load testing and FT-AT in 97 patients
and elastography in 270 patients.
Treatment of chronic hepatitis B
A total of 646 patients have been treated (mean of 1.6 different
treatments per patient), 97 with interferon, 78 with pegylated
interferon, 552 with lamivudine, 247 with adefovir, 55 with tenofovir
and 67 with entecavir. Patients were treated according to standard
guidelines (ALT or biopsy), and more recently according to new

evolving criteria: viral load, FT or Fibroscan. The distribution of
these criteria were: elevated ALT (n = 255), F1 or greater at biopsy
(n = 295), A1 or greater at biopsy (n = 304), DNA equal or greater
than Log5 (n = 187), FT greater than F0 (n = 447), ActiTest greater
than A0 (n = 407), liver stiffness measurements greater than 7.1 kPa
(n = 80). A total of 508 patients (79%) have been treated according to
standard criteria (ALT, biopsy and viral load) and 138 (21%)
according to FT-AT, Fibroscan or specific protocols.
Accuracy of biomarkers for the diagnosis of advanced
fibrosis
The accuracy of FT for the diagnosis of advanced fibrosis was
compared with other available markers. It was similar to previous
validations, and higher than ALT, viral load and APRI, both using
simultaneous biopsies (n = 97, AUROC = 0.83 95%CI 0.71–0.91)
versus ALT (0.60; 95%CI 0.47–0.71 P = 0.0007), viral load (0.55;
95%CI 0.42–0.66 P = 0.0002) and APRI index (0.66; 95%CI
0.51–0.77 P = 0.002); or in all biopsies (n = 505, AUROC = 0.78
95%CI 0.73–0.82) versus ALT (AUROC = 0.57; 0.50–0.62

Prognostic values of biomarkers viral load and biopsy
Survival curves. The survival outcomes of patients classified
according to previously defined FT cut-offs are presented in
Table 3. Survivals of the treated patients were similar to those of
the non–treated in different groups of viral load (Table 3).
In the minimal severity group there were 4 complications: 3
patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (including one death),
without cirrhosis, and one patient without cirrhosis treated with
lamivudine with one flare-up associated with viral resistance, i.e.
98.9% (95%CI, 97.8%–100%) survival without complications.
In the moderate group, there were 6 complications, including
one HBV – related death, i.e. 94.1% (95%CI, 88.8%–99.5%)
survival without complications.
In the severe group there were 40 complications including 25
HBV- related deaths, i.e. 77.6% (95%CI, 71.3%–83.9%) survival
without complications. Survivals of the treated patients were higher
than those of the non –treated in patients with severe fibrosis (Table 3).
Area under the prognosis ROC curves. Among the 1,074
patients the prognostic AUROCs of FT were greater than AT,
ALT or viral load for all the prognostic criteria (Table 4). For the
main endpoint, survival without complications, AUROCs were
0.89 (0.84–0.93) vs 0.77 (0.69–0.83), 0.53 (0.46–0.60) and 0.64
(0.55–0.71), respectively (all P,0.004).
The AUROC of FT versus fibrosis staging at biopsy for the
prognosis or HBV-related death or complications were similar
among the 97 patients with simultaneous assessments at baseline:
0.98 (0.89–0.99) versus 0.97 (0.93–0.99; P = 0.71) (Table 5).
The FT AUROCs for survival endpoints were also all greater
(P,0.01) than the AUROCs of the other indexes, the Pugh, and
APRI (Table 6).
Multivariate prognostic analysis. In the prospective
follow-up, FT-AT, age, male gender, Caucasian origin, viral
load and heavy alcohol consumption were associated with survival
without complications or death in univariate analysis. In
multivariate analysis FT (P,0.001) and viral load (P = 0.007)
were the most significant independent factors, with a marginal
significance (P = 0.052) for ALT, and age (P = 0.03) (Table 7).
HBV treatment has no significant impact on survival when
adjusted on FT, viral load and age.
In the retrospective follow-up, only FT was associated with
HBV complications [(logistic regression coefficient = 6.2; 95%CI
5.0–7.4 (P,0.001)].
Definition of inactive HBV carrier
The classical definition of inactive carrier was observed in 275
untreated patients, without coinfection with HCV, Delta or HIV.
The negative predictive value of this definition was 98.1% at 4
years; 3 patients died, one of HBV (decompensated cirrhosis,
presumed at FT and confirmed at biopsy), another patient died
from lung cancer (with non-decompensated cirrhosis, presumed at
FT and confirmed with biopsy) and the last from an unknown cause;
62 (23%) of these ‘‘classically defined inactive carrier’’ patients had
fibrosis presumed with FT: 13 F1 (portal fibrosis), 31 F1–F2, 9 F2
(bridging fibrosis), 4 many septa (F3) and 5 cirrhosis (F4).
Among these 275 classical inactive carriers, none had viral
coinfection, 11 (4%) were heavy drinkers, and none had hepatocel￾lular carcinoma. Among these 11 drinkers, 3 had fibrosis. When these
11 patients were excluded, the percentage of pure HBsAg carrier with
abnormal FTs indicating fibrosis was still high = 22% (59/264).
A new definition of inactive carriers (n = 289, untreated
patients, without coinfection with HCV, Delta or HIV) was
proposed with an algorithm combining ‘‘zero’’ scores for FT-AT
(F0 and A0) and different viral load levels (Figure 1). This new
algorithm provides a 100% NPV for the prediction of liver related
complications, both in HBeAg negative and positive cases.
The comparisons of survival curves between these inactive
carriers defined with normal FT-AT (F0A0) versus active carriers
(nonF0A0) are detailed in Table 8.
Thus we have proposed three categories of F0A0 according to
viral load (Figure 1).
The first is the inactive carrier category with low or intermediate
viral load; 270 (93.4%) patients A0F0 belonged to this category
including 265 HBeAg negative and 5 HBeAg positive patients.
The second is the category of immuno-tolerant HBeAg positive
patients with high viral load: 19 (3.5%) patients A0F0 belonged to
this category.

The third category is HBeAg negative and anti-HBe positive
patients with high viral load: nine (3.1%) patients A0F0 belonged
to this category.
Repeated biomarkers in inactive carriers
FT-AT was repeated during follow-up in 160 inactive carriers
with excellent reproducibility. The Spearman correlation coeffi￾cients were 0.74, 0.64, 0.77 between baseline and the second, third
and fourth assessments respectively for FT (P,0.001). Only one
patient (1/160 = 0.6%) had a repeated FT suggesting advanced
fibrosis (FT = 0.49), with a high-risk profile of false positive
(hemolysis suspected with haptoglobin = 0.24 g/L and unconju￾gated bilirubin = 32 microm/L).
For AT the correlations were 0.67, 0.66, 0.67 between baseline
and the second, third and fourth assessments, respectively
(P,0.001). Only two patients (2/160 = 1.2%) had a repeated AT

suggesting moderate activity (AT = 0.53, 0.54). One of these two
patients was an HBeAg negative patient, with high baseline viral
load and heavy alcohol consumption (A1F0 at biopsy).
For ALT the correlations were 0.65, 0.63, 0.63 between
baseline and the second, third and fourth assessments, respectively
(P,0.001).
Among 289 patients with baseline normal ALT, 277 (93.4%)
had a repeated normal ALT for 18 months or more.
FibroTest failure
Security algorithms identified 16/1074 (1.5%) patients with
high risk profiles of false positives/negatives: 11 with very low
haptoglobin concentration (hemolysis or anhaptoglobinemia), 3
with suspected Gilbert’s syndrome, and 2 with very low
apolipoprotein A1 concentration, which could have a significant
impact (0.30 or more) on the FT score.
The FT-AT AUROCs predictive values for survival without
HBV complications were still highly significant after exclusion of
16 patients with FT high-risk profiles of false positives/negatives
(n = 1,058 AUROC = 0.88, 95%CI 0.81–0.92; P,0.001),
Impact of HBV treatment on biomarkers
Among the treated patients, the first FT has been performed in
276 patients before treatment and among 370 patients during or
after treatment.
Among the 213 treated patients the repeated FT decreased from
a mean baseline 0.34 (95%CI 0.30–0.37) to 0.29 (95% CI 0.26–
0.32; P,0.001) and the AT from 0.34 (95%CI 0.30–0.38) to 0.19
(95%CI 0.17–0.21; P,0.001). The impact of treatment on
biomarkers was higher among the 95 patients with baseline
moderate or severe fibrosis: the FT decreased from a mean
baseline 0.56 (95%CI 0.52–0.59) to 0.45 (95% CI 0.40–0.49;

(95%CI 0.20–0.27; P,0.001).
Sensitivity analyses
Confounding factors. The FT prognostic value was very
significant both among males using prognostic AUROC for survival
without complications = 0.85 95%CI = 0.77–0.90 as well as in
females (AUROC = 0.94 95%CI 0.83–0.98). The FT prognostic
value was very significant both among 555 patients with BMI lower
than 27 kg/m2 using prognostic AUROC for survival without
complications = 0.85 95%CI = 0.73–0.91 as well as in 146 patients
with BMI . = 27 kg/m2 (AUROC = 0.96 95%CI 0.89–0.98).
Clinically obvious cirrhosis. The FT-AT AUROCs
predictive values for survival without HBV complications were
still highly significant after exclusion of 47 (4.4%) patients with
clinically obvious cirrhosis (n = 1047 AUROC = 0.82, 95%CI
0.71–0.88; P,0.001)
Patients with coinfection with Delta, HIV or HCV. The
FT-AT AUROCs predictive values for survival without HBV
complications were still highly significant and after exclusion of
167 patients without coinfection with Delta, HIV or HCV
(n = 907, AUROC = 0.87, 95%CI 0.80–0.92; P,0.001). They
were significant among patients with coinfection (n = 167,
AUROC = 0.85, 95%CI 0.76–0.91), and in patients with normal
baseline ALT (n = 772, AUROC = 0.87 95%CI 0.81–0.94) or
elevated ALT (n = 302, AUROC = 0.82, 95%CI 0.71–0.89). The
group of 14 patients coinfected with HCV, Delta or HIV and
normal FT-AT had also no death or complications at 4 years
versus 2 among the 17 patients with abnormal FT-AT.
Patients with elastography. Among 270 patients who had
both FT and elastography, the prognostic AUROCs were 0.80,
95%CI 0.55–0.92 and 0.71 95%CI 0.40–0.87; P = 0.42, respectively.
There was a very significant concordance between FT and liver
stiffness measurements (Spearman correlation = 0.47; P,0.001).
Discussion
Among the three working hypotheses, all were confirmed. FT
and AT together with viral load helped to better define the
prognosis of patients with chronic hepatitis B compared to viral
load, transaminases ALT and HBeAg status. The prognostic value
of FT was similar to that of liver biopsy when simultaneously
performed, as observed in patients with chronic hepatitis C [21]. A
simple combination of FT-AT with viral load assessment has
helped to better define the status of inactive (‘‘healthy’’) carriers
versus active carriers.
Until now, the prognostic markers recommended for use in
chronic HBV, relied on histological fibrosis staging of biopsy
specimens, viral load, and HBeAg status, have never been assessed
altogether in a longitudinal study on a large number of patients
[1–3,34–35].
Limitations of the study
Our study has several limitations.
Tertiary center bias. The included population was not a
random, community-based population. In a tertiary center the
major risk of bias is an over-representation of patients with severe
disease. However the characteristics of included patients were
similar to published studies on global populations [1–3] (Table 1).
There was no over-representation of severe diseases with only one￾third of patients with advanced fibrosis diagnosed using biopsy or
FT and 40% of patients never treated. Clinically obvious cirrhosis at
baseline represented only 4% of included patients. Sensitivity
analyses excluding these patients gave similar results. A possible bias
Figure 1. Untreated patients classified according to biomarkers, viral load and HBeAg No liver related complications occurred
during the 4-year follow-up among patients with baseline normal FibroTest and normal ActiTest. This new definition had a 100%
negative predictive value for liver related complications or death. Using the classical definition of inactive carrier with normal transaminases, 23% had
presumed fibrosis, and 3 complications occurred during the follow-up.

in European studies can be the non-inclusion of non-Caucasian
patients. In the present cohort Caucasians and North Africans
represented only 26% of the population and the prognostic value of
FT persisted after adjustment for the ethnic origins.
Study power. We acknowledge that the number of events
was small for death and complications among the inactive carrier,
but the number of patients with fibrosis missed by the classical
definition of inactive carrier (62 patients with fibrosis, that is 23%
of the so called ‘‘inactive carrier’’) was impressive. As there is an
obvious rational relationship between the presence of fibrosis, and
the possible progression to cirrhosis and to severe complications,
the message for patients and clinicians is important. The negative
predictive value of the classical definition is not sufficient to
exclude advanced fibrosis and therefore to exclude a risk of
complications even during a 4 year follow-up. At least 18 patients
out of these ‘‘inactive carrier’’ had bridging fibrosis, many septa or
cirrhosis, and needed a treatment to prevent complications. For
patients with portal fibrosis or intermediate stage between portal
and bridging fibrosis the treatment is less urgent, but they should
be monitored more frequently than patients without fibrosis.’’
We acknowledge that the number of patients with simultaneous
biopsy and FT-AT (n = 97) was small. However FT-AT have been
previously extensively validated in patients with chronic hepatitis B
(n = 1,457), whether treated or not [10,13–16]. A new validation
was also performed in the present study on a total of 505 patients
with similar accuracy, both in the simultaneous or non￾simultaneous biopsies. It seems very difficult nowadays to convince
a large group of patients of the utility of first line liver biopsy,
particularly in patients with non-elevated transaminases.
The number of patients with profiles of immunotolerance was
small and further validations are needed in such populations [36].
Another limitation of our study is the limited number of patients
(n = 61) with coinfection with HIV, as indinavir and atazanavir, can
increased significantly unconjugated bilirubin, with a risk of FT false
positive. However our results confirmed that in patients with coinfec￾tion with HBV or HCV and HIV, the FT diagnostic value was
similar than in mono infected patients [37]. No false positives have
been observed among the nine patients treated with these two drugs.
Advantages of the study
Prognostic value. Our results indicate that the combination
of FT together with baseline viral load was the best combination
for predicting survival without complications at 4-years, regardless
of the treatment and other risk factors.
The overall survival of patients with non-severe fibrosis at
baseline was close to that of paired controls in the general
population. In patients with severe fibrosis, overall survival was
17% lower than that of the control population. In patients without
clinically obvious cirrhosis the overall survival was better, but still
lower than in the control population.
Prognostic factors. We have assessed the independent
prognostic values of the most important identified prognostic
factors [3]. After taking into account FT and viral load, only age
had marginal prognostic values. Their respective associations with
fibrosis probably confounded the univariate prognostic value of male
gender, alcohol consumption and ethnic origin. We acknowledge that
we focused on the most important prognostic factors [3]. Future
studies should also include HBV genotype assessment, metabolic
factors as well as the presence of liver steatosis.
Comparison with other prognostic markers. Despite a
highly significant difference in favor of FT, the Pugh score
prognostic value was good. However, for clinicians the advantage
of FT is to have a consistent prognostic value from early fibrosis
stage to cirrhosis.
Although this prognostic study was not specifically designed to
validate FT as a true surrogate endpoint of the severity of HBV
chronic hepatitis [38], we observed as in HCV chronic hepatitis
that FT fulfilled almost all of the 13 criteria of a surrogate endpoint
biomarker [21,39], including specificity and sensitivity for fibrosis
[10,20–22]. FT is indicative of the response to HBV virological
treatment, with FT improvement and cirrhosis reversal [14,16];
Intra and interobserver variability of FT has been studied;
preanalytical and analytical recommendations have also been
issued [10,20–22]. Serial monitoring of FT is possible
[14,16,21,40,41,42]. In comparison, liver biopsy does not satisfy
several quality criteria as a surrogate endpoint marker [39].
Our data confirm that FT has a better prognostic value than
ALT, even using a very low definition of normal upper limit, or
APRI. This was expected since these indexes have lower values for
the diagnosis of advanced fibrosis as assessed by AUROCs
[2,10,13–16]. In multivariate analysis the ActiTest a biomarker of
necrosis and inflammation add no supplementary prognostic value
to the knowledge of FT and viral load. However more patients are
needed to assess the independent prognostic value of ActiTest
particularly in patients anti-HBe positive, at higher risk of flares.
Impact of HBV treatments. The results confirm the very
significant impact of HBV treatments on repeated FT and AT,
particularly in patients with moderate or severe fibrosis at baseline as
previously observed in two other studies with paired samples [14,16].
Our study was not conclusive for the use of FT-AT scores to
determine the need for treatment, but the results supported a
simple new definition of inactive HBV carrier. Because patients
with normal FT-AT scores were unlikely to develop complications,
decisions not to treat such patients were unlikely to be associated
with clinical decompensation, at least over a relatively short follow￾up period. The diagnostic and prognostic values of FT persisted
among treated or non-treated patients.
In conclusion, FT has significant prognostic values at 4 years in
patients infected by HBV, similar to that of liver biopsy. A
combination of FT-AT and viral load more accurately defined the
status of inactive HBV carrier than the ALT and viral load.
