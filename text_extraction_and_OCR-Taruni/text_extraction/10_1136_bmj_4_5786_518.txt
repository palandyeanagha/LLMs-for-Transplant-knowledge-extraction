The high correlation between the degree of hypoxia and
both T.C.T. and F.D.P. levels indicates that these are useful
tests in the evaluation of the clotting status of a newborn
infant. The two tests are interdependent, but whereas it is
possible to do the T.C.T. in minutes, estimation of F.D.P.
takes several hours.
Despite the pronounced impairment of the clotting state
of these infants, there was no overt evidence of haemorrhage.
Nevertheless, it cannot be assumed that such infants escape
unscathed from the hypoxic episode, since the very process
which caused the consumption of coagulation factors results
in deposition of fibrin, and this may have led to damage of
vital organs such as the brain. That damage can result is
suggested by a recent report (Bryant et al., 1970) and further
work is being conducted in this centre to evaluate this possible
effect.

Comparative Nephrotoxicity of Aspirin and Phenacetin
Derivatives

Summary
Both aspirin and phenacetin derivatives were shown to
be nephrotoxic when administered to rats as a single
intravenous injection. Phenacetin derivatives tended to
produce more severe renal damage and to be nephro￾toxic in smaller doses than aspirin derivatives. With
the exception of a single derivative, the renal lesions were
confined to the proximal convoluted tubule, even after
administration of compounds which under other condi￾tions have induced renal papillary necrosis.
Introduction
Though an association between abuse of analgesics and renal
damage has been recorded many times by groups of observers
from different countries, the processes causing the renal
lesions are not known, and there is not even agreement regarding
the identity of the analgesic compound responsible for the
damage (Koutsaimanis and de Wardener, 1970; Nanra and
Kincaid-Smith, 1970). Since the acute effects of these com￾pounds on the mammalian nephron can be conveniently
assessed after intravenous administration in rats (Green, Ham,
and Tange, 1969), this experimental method has been used to
compare the nephrotoxicity of aspirin and phenacetin derivatives.

Methods
Female hooded rats, weighing about 200 g, were divided into
groups of five animals and individually marked. They were
given tap-water to drink and a pellet diet.
Compounds under investigation were injected as the hydro￾chloride or as the sodium salt (Tables I and II). Single intrave￾nous injections of 1 ml or less were given, and the dose and
concentration were determined in preliminary experiments,
which also allowed assessment of the maximum dose compatible
with survival. Animals were lightly anaesthetized with ether
for tail vein injection and were killed by bleeding under ether
anaesthesia 48 hours later. The kidneys were removed, fixed in
10% neutral formalin, and processed by routine methods for
light microscopy.
Twenty-two compounds were tested, all on groups of five
animals. Some compounds were tested at several dose levels
(Tables I and II). Compounds were either commercially
available or were synthesized by standard techniques and all
samples purified before use.
Total p-aminophenol was estimated after hot acid hydrolysis
and 0-conjugated p-aminophenol was estimated after hydrolysis
with glusulase. p-Aminophenol was determined by the indo￾phenol colorimetric method (Tompsett, 1969). Two groups,
each of five rats, were used as controls, and these animals were
given a single intravenous injection of 1 ml of sterile normal
saline.
Results
The nephrotoxic effect of these aspirin and phenacetin deri￾vatives was manifest as necrosis of the proximal convoluted
tubule. With the exception of the coincident renal papillary
necrosis produced by m-aminosalicylic acid, this was the only
lesion found in the experiment. Four grades of proximal

PHENACETIN DERIVATIVES
Under the conditions of the experiment this group of com￾pounds was more nephrotoxic than aspirin and its derivatives,
producing more severe renal damage and at lower dose levels
(Fig. 5). Increasing doses of phenacetin derivatives produced
conspicuous increases in renal damage in contrast to the effects
produced by increasing doses of aspirin derivatives.
The nephrotoxic effect of phenacetin derivatives seems to
result from the para arrangement on the benzene ring of the
hydroxyl and amino groups. Thus p-aminophenol is nephrotoxic
while m-aminophenol and o-aminophenol are not. Substitution
on the hydroxyl group by conversion to the ether also removes
the nephrotoxic effect, thus p-phenetidine is not nephrotoxic.
These effects are also observed with 3, 4-dihydroxyaniline and
its ethers (Table I). 3, 4-Dihydroxyaniline and 4-hydroxy-3-
methoxyaniline are extremely nephrotoxic, but 3-hydroxy-4-

methoxyaniline and 3, 4-dimethoxyaniline are both non￾nephrotoxic.
Modification of the amino group also affects nephrotoxicity.
One methyl group substituted on the amino group increases
nephrotoxicity. An acetyl group reduces it; N-acetyl-p-amino￾phenol (paracetamol) did not induce renal damage. However,
0-substitution of an acetyl group does not affect nephrotoxicity.
There were five nephrotoxic compounds related to phenacetin
in which a para arrangement of hydroxyl and amino groups was
not present-aniline, 2-hydroxyphenetidine, N-methylaniline,
phenylhydroxylamine, and 2, 6-dihydroxyaniline. The first two
were minimally nephrotoxic, the third and fourth moderately so,
and the fifth was as nephrotoxic as p-aminophenol. Chemical
analysis of urinary excretion products showed that p-amino￾phenol was formed from aniline.
Urinary excretion products were measured for a number of
compounds. After a single dose of p-aminophenol (2 mM/kg)
about 600' was N-acetylated and conjugated and some 200
excreted as non-acetylated but conjugated p-aminophenol;
0-05 mg of free p-aminophenol could be detected after extraction
of a neutral unhydrolysed sample of urine.

ASPIRIN DERIVATIVES
Both aspirin and sodium salicylate were nephrotoxic in high
intravenous doses, but not in doses below 3 mM/kg. Above this
dose relatively little variation in the degree of renal damage was
produced by increasing doses of these compounds. p-Amino￾salicylic acid and the two dihydroxybenzoic acids investigated
were not nephrotoxic. A sixth compound, m-aminosalicylic
acid (5-aminosalicylic acid), which may be considered as a
derivative of both phenacetin and aspirin, produced necrosis of
proximal convoluted tubules and of the renal papilla.
Discussion
The results indicate that in this experimental model phenacetin
derivatives are much more nephrotoxic than aspirin and its
derivatives. The results supplement earlier observations (Green
et al., 1969) which suggested that the toxicity of some phenacetin
derivatives might be related to the para arrangement of amino
and hydroxyl groups on the benzene ring. Since phenacetin
cannot be made water soluble it was not studied in this experi￾ment, but findings with N-acetyl-p-aminophenol and p￾phenetidine indicate that the acetylation of the amino group and
alkylation of the hydroxyl group of the phenacetin molecule
each independently masks the nephrotoxicity due to the para
arrangement of amino and hydroxyl groups. N-acetyl-p￾aminophenol was not nephrotoxic in this acute experiment;
this, of course, does not necessarily imply that it could not
contribute to analgesic renal damage in man, or that it might
not under other circumstances be deacetylated to nephrotoxic
p-aminophenol. Indeed, N-acetyl-p-aminophenol labelled on
the acetyl group can be shown to exchange acetyl groups after
being fed to certain species (Smith, Davison, and Sodd, 1956).
However, it is consistent with clinical (Prescott, Roscoe,
Wright, and Brown, 1971) and experimental (Boyd and Bere￾czky, 1966) findings that acute poisoning by N-acetyl-p￾aminophenol is associated with hepatic rather than renal
damage.
A number of compounds related to phenacetin but lacking
the para arrangement of the amino and hydroxyl groups were
found to be nephrotoxic. These were aniline, N-methylaniline,
phenylhydroxylamine, 2-hydroxyphenetidine, and 2, 6-dihydro￾xyaniline. p-Aminophenol was found in the urine after ad￾ministration of aniline, and this compound is known to be
formed in the metabolism of phenylhydroxylamine (Banthorpe,
1968). Methods have yet to be devised to determine the meta￾bolites of 2-hydroxyphenetidine and 2, 6-dihydroxyaniline.
It is true that neither p-aminophenol nor any other nephrotoxic
metabolite has been shown to be derived from phenacetin in
man. Nor is this to be expected; large single overdoses of
phenacetin have not been shown to be nephrotoxic, and were
p-aminophenol formed, such doses should invariably be nephro￾toxic. Enzymes to convert phenacetin to p-aminophenol exist
in the body and are known to be involved in the metabolism of
phenacetin. A transient diversion of the metabolism of phenace￾tin to the production of p-aminophenol is thus consistent with
the occasional acute, severe renal damage which is believed to
develop during long-continued overdosage with analgesic
compounds.
It is noteworthy that aspirin and sodium salicylate, rather than
their related compounds, are nephrotoxic in high doses. Aspirin
causes necrosis of proximal convoluted tubules, similar to
lesions produced by sodium salicylate (Robinson, Nichols, and
Taitz, 1967), and does not lead to the renal papillary necrosis
which has developed in protracted high-dose feeding experi￾ments (Nanra and Kincaid-Smith, 1970). Similarly, necrosis of
proximal convoluted tubules rather than papillary necrosis
(White and Mori-Chavez, 1952) was found with N-methylani￾line.
In further studies it has been found that necrosis of proximal
convoluted tubules can be produced by a single intravenous
injection of N-phenylanthranilic acid and of 1, 2, 3, 4-tetra￾hydroquinoline, which under other regimens have been shown
to produce renal papillary necrosis (Hardy, 1970; Rehns, 1901).
This unexpected finding emphasizes the importance of ascer￾taining the factors responsible for medullary localization of toxic
nephron damage, and suggests that characterization of analgesic
renal damage as a primarily medullary lesion with secondary
cortical damage (Kincaid-Smith, 1967) may be an unduly simple
approach to an extremely complex problem. Localized necrosis
may be only the most obvious manifestation of damage to the
whole nephron. This is indicated by the simultaneous onset of
convoluted tubule and renal papillary necrosis after a single
intravenous injection of m-aminosalicylic acid (Calder, Funder,
Green, Ham, and Tange, 1971), by electron microscopic
appearances of severe damage in Henle's loops in rats in which
necrosis of proximal convoluted tubules has been induced by
p-aminophenol (Funder, Green, Ham, and Tange, 1971), and
by functional evidence of distal nephron involvement after
uranium-induced injury to the proximal nephron (Bowman and
Foukes, 1970).
