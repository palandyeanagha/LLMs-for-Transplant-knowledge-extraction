Abstract
Background: Measurement of pH in exhaled breath condensate
(EBC) is robust and simple. Acidic source fluid (airway lining fluid)
traps bases while volatilising acids, leading to EBC acidification in
many lung diseases. Lower airway ammonia is one determinant of
airway lining fluid pH, raising the concern that addition of the base
ammonia by contamination from the mouth might confound EBC
pH assays.
Methods: Three discrete methods were used to limit oral ammonia
contamination of EBC collections: endotracheal intubation, oral
rinsing, and −40°C condenser temperatures. Separately, ammonia
was removed from collected EBC samples by lyophilisation and
resuspension. Intraweek and intraday variability of ammonia
concentration was determined in 76 subjects, and ammonia and pH
from a further 235 samples were graphically compared. Ammonia
was assayed spectrophotometrically and pH was assessed after
deaeration.
Results: Data from 1091 samples are presented. Ammonia was
reduced in EBC by all methods. Endotracheal intubation decreased
EBC ammonia from a mean (SD) of 619 (124) μM to 80 (24) μM
(p<0.001, n = 32). Oral rinsing before collection also led to a
decline in EBC ammonia from 573 (307) μM to 224 (80) μM (p = 
0.016, n = 7). The colder the condensation temperature used, the
less ammonia was trapped in the EBC. Lyophilisation removed 99.4


(1.9)% of ammonia. Most importantly, the pH of EBC never
decreased after removal of ammonia by any of these methods.
Intraweek and intraday coefficients of variation for ammonia were
64 (27)% and 60 (32)%, which is substantially more variable than
EBC pH assays.
Conclusions: Although ammonia and pH appear to correlate in
EBC, the oral ammonia concentration is not an important
determinant of EBC pH. No precautions need to be taken to exclude
oral ammonia when EBC pH is of interest. The low pH and low
ammonia found in EBC from patients with lung diseases appear to
be independent effects of volatile compounds arising from the
airway.
