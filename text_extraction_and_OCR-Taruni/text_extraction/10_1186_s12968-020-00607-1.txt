Abstract
This document is an update to the 2013 publication of the Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (SCMR)
Board of Trustees Task Force on Standardized Protocols. Concurrent with this publication, 3 additional task forces
will publish documents that should be referred to in conjunction with the present document. The first is a
document on the Clinical Indications for CMR, an update of the 2004 document. The second task force will be
updating the document on Reporting published by that SCMR Task Force in 2010. The 3rd task force will be
updating the 2013 document on Post-Processing. All protocols relative to congenital heart disease are covered in a
separate document.
The section on general principles and techniques has been expanded as more of the techniques common to CMR
have been standardized. A section on imaging in patients with devices has been added as this is increasingly seen
in day-to-day clinical practice. The authors hope that this document continues to standardize and simplify the
patient-based approach to clinical CMR. It will be updated at regular intervals as the field of CMR advances.
Introduction
This document is an update to the 2013 publication of the
Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (SCMR)
Board of Trustees Task Force on Standardized Protocols
[1]. Concurrent with this publication, 3 additional task
forces will publish documents that should be referred to
in conjunction with the present document. The first is a
document on the Clinical Indications for CMR [2], an up￾date of the 2004 document. The second task force will be
updating the document on Reporting published by that
SCMR Task Force in 2010 [3]. The 3rd task force will be
updating the 2013 document on Post-Processing [4]. All
protocols relative to congenital heart disease are covered
in a separate document [5].
The section on general principles and techniques has
been expanded as more of the techniques common to
cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) have been
standardized. A section on imaging in patients with
devices has been added as this is increasingly seen in
day-to-day clinical practice. The authors hope that this
document continues to standardize and simplify the
patient-based approach to clinical CMR. It will be up￾dated at regular intervals as the field of CMR advances.
General principles
Field strength considerations
Clinical CMR can be performed at different field
strengths. 1.5 T systems are currently used for the ma￾jority of examinations. An increasing number of studies,
however, are being performed at 3 T, with advantages
and caveats as noted below.
1. Electrocardiographic (ECG) gating may be more
problematic at 3 T than at 1.5 T. In cases where the
ECG signal is unreliable, peripheral pulse gating
may succeed for acquisitions that are amenable to
retrospective gating, such as cine imaging.
2. As a result of improved signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR), 3 T may be advantageous for first pass
contrast-enhanced perfusion imaging and late

gadolinium enhancement. Furthermore, tagging
sequences and 4D flow techniques may benefit
from imaging at 3 T.
3. Balanced steady-state free precession (bSSFP) is well
established as the default method of choice for cine
imaging at 1.5 T. At 3 T, however, the increased
sensitivity of bSSFP to off- resonance effects tends
to worsen dark banding and flow artifacts. To miti￾gate these artifacts, it may be necessary to perform
careful shimming. In rare cases, patient-specific fre￾quency adjustment may be required.
4. Devices that have been tested and determined to be
safe at 1.5 T may not be safe at 3 T. Please check
specific information relating to CMR safety of
devices at higher magnetic field strengths. (Please
see section 1.6 below.)
Equipment considerations
CMR scanner
1. MR scanners for clinical CMR should have field
strength of ≥1.0 T; however, the typical field
strength employed is 1.5 T with a number of
centers using 3 T scanners.
2. A cardiac imaging specific surface coil with multiple
coil elements (typically ≥8 elements) is highly
recommended, and is required to employ parallel
imaging techniques that reduce scan and
breathhold times.
3. ECG-gating hardware and software are required,
and preferably incorporate vector-cardiographic
gating. ECG-gating capabilities should include the
ability to perform prospective gating, retrospective
gating, and triggered gating techniques.
Software/pulse sequences
1. Required pulse sequences for CMR examinations:
cine bSSFP imaging, rapid multi-slice myocardial
perfusion imaging, late-gadolinium enhancement
(LGE) imaging, phase-contrast flow quantification
imaging, and 3D contrast-enhanced angiographic
imaging.
2. Parallel imaging capabilities (e.g., Sensitivity
encoding (SENSE), simultaneous acquisition of
spatial harmonics (SMASH), generalized
autocalibrating partially parallel acquisition
(GRAPPA)) are highly recommended to reduce
scan and breathhold times.
Accessory hardware
1. A CMR-compatible power injector is required for
performing rapid myocardial perfusion imaging or
contrast-enhanced MR angiographic (MRA)
techniques.
Stress agents
Vasodilator stress perfusion testing is more commonly
performed than inotropic stress functional testing.
Vasodilator stress agents:
1. Adenosine:140 μg/kg body weight/min for 2–4 min
(consider an increase up to 210 μg/kg body weight/
min depending on institutional and local norms if,
after 2–3 min, heart rate (HR) does not increase by
10 bpm and or systolic blood pressure does not
drop by > 10 mmHg)
2. Dipyridamole: 0.142 μg/kg/min over 4 min
3. Regadenoson: 0.4 mg single injection
4. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) – 140 μg /kg/min for
3–5 min (consider an increase up to 210 μg/kg body
weight/min depending on institutional and local
norms if, after 2–3 min, HR does not increase by
10 bpm and or blood pressure does not drop by >
10 mmHg)
Inotropic stress agents:
1. Dobutamine: typical maximum dose 40μg/kg/min ±
atropine: 0.25 mg fractions typical (maximal dose 2
mg) (ischemia) or 2.5–10 μg/kg/min dobutamine
(viability)
Contraindications
Adenosine, dipyridamole, ATP, or regadenoson
 2nd degree (type 2) or complete atrioventricular
(AV) block
 Systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg
 Severe systemic arterial hypertension (> 220/120
mmHg)
 Sinus bradycardia (heart rate < 40 bpm)
 Active bronchoconstrictive or bronchospastic
disease with regular use of inhalers
 Known hypersensitivity to adenosine, dipyridamole,
or regadenoson
Dobutamine
 Severe systemic arterial hypertension (≥ 220/120
mmHg)
 Unstable angina pectoris
 Severe aortic valve stenosis (peak aortic valve
gradient > 60 mmHg or aortic valve area < 1 cm2
)
 Complex cardiac arrhythmias including uncontrolled
atrial fibrillation
 Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy
Kramer et al. Journal of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (2020) 22:17 Page 2 of 18

 Myocarditis, endocarditis, or pericarditis
 Uncontrolled heart failure
Atropine
 Narrow-angle glaucoma
 Myasthenia gravis
 Obstructive uropathy
 Obstructive gastrointestinal disorders
Patient preparation
1. If applicable for the center, obtain informed consent
for the stress test.
2. To fully exert the stress agents’ effects patients
should optimally refrain from the following
substances/medications for 12-24 hours prior to the
examination due to potential of interaction with the
stress agent.
 All vasodilating agents: caffeine (coffee, tea,
caffeinated beverages or foods - e.g., chocolate,
caffeinated medications), theophylline,
dipyridamole.
 Dobutamine: ß-blockers and nitrates.
Note: There is increasing data that the effects of
caffeine and nicotine can be overcome by higher
doses of adenosine as well as regadenoson.
3. Fasting is not mandatory, but is often advised
because recognized adverse effects of stress agents
include nausea and vomiting, which may be
problematic when lying supine in the restricted
space of the scanner.
4. If adenosine is used, it is preferred that two
intravenous lines should be available, one for
gadolinium based contrast agent (GBCA) and one
for adenosine, one in each arm. The preferential
site of contrast infusion is antecubital vein, but
other veins can be used. The largest cannula should
be used for contrast agent. The rate of infusion of
contrast agent should be adjusted based on the size
of the cannula used.
5. The blood pressure cuff should be used with care
taken not to interfere with GBCA or adenosine
infusion.
6. For regadenoson, only one intravenous line is
required. Many sites reverse the regadenoson with
aminophylline 100 mg IV after acquiring stress
images. While this may reduce the side effects and
return heart rate to baseline immediately,
aminophylline also has arrhythmogenic side effects
and should thus be used with caution. Side effects
usually dissipate after 2–3 min.
7. Side effects are described as less significant with
regadenoson than with the other vasodilators;
however, the half-life of regadenoson is longer if
not actively reversed.
Potential adverse effects
Adenosine, ATP, and regadenoson may cause flushing,
chest pain, palpitations, and breathlessness. More severe
side effects include transient heart block, transient
hypotension, or bronchospasm.
Dipyridamole may cause chest pain, headache, and
dizziness. More severe side effects are rare and include
myocardial infarction, ventricular tachycardia, and tran￾sient ischemic attack.
Dobutamine at high doses may cause chest pain and
palpitations. More severe complications are rare, includ￾ing myocardial infarction, ventricular fibrillation, and
sustained ventricular tachycardia.
Stress and safety equipment
1. Monitoring equipment (blood pressure; at least
single lead ECG for monitoring of cardiac rhythm;
intercom to communicate with patient; for patients
with devices - pulse oximetry)
2. Preparation and regular departmental practice for
rapid removal of the patient from the scanner
3. Emergency resuscitation policy in place
4. Crash cart with appropriate resuscitative
medications, supplies, and equipment with
established location outside the scanner room
a. Immediately at hand: ß-blocker (e.g., esmolol or
metoprolol), nitroglycerin, aminophylline,
bronchodilators, oxygen
b. In an emergency cart: full set of emergency
drugs (including drugs such as: epinephrine, ß￾blockers, atropine, bronchodilators,
antiarrhythmic drugs)
5. For dobutamine – Ability to rapidly review images
for assessment of wall motion during image
acquisition
Gadolinium based contrast agent (GBCA) dosing and
safety
See Table 1.
Notes:
1. Volumes and injection rates vary depending on the
contrast agent and scan protocol.
2. Injection rates are different for 1 mmol/ml contrast
agents (e.g., gadobutrol) and 0.5 mmol/ml agents.
As a guideline, divide the given injection rates by a
factor of 2 for the 1 mmol/ml formulation.
3. GBCA contrast agents with higher relaxivity require
smaller doses.
Kramer et al. Journal of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (2020) 22:17 Page 3 of 18

Safety considerations:
1. More than 300 million GBCA doses have been
applied worldwide since 1988 [5]. GBCAs provide
crucial medical information in many applications
and have an excellent safety profile.
2. However, nephrogenic systemic sclerosis (NSF) and
long-term gadolinium retention in the brain have
resulted in regulatory actions.
3. In 2017 the European Medicines Agency (EMA)
decided to suspend the marketing authorizations of all
multipurpose linear GBCAs and to continue to use all
macrocyclic GBCAs. The United States Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) maintained all GBCAs
but decided that warnings have to be included in the
prescribing information that communicates the
greater risk of gadolinium deposition when using
linear GBCAs. Additionally, product information
updates should incorporate risk mitigation steps and a
Medication Guide for each product.
4. Healthcare professionals should consider the
retention characteristics of each agent when choosing
a GBCA, and particularly for patients who may be at
higher risk for gadolinium retention or NSF [6].
5. The dose of GBCA in all CMR applications should
be as low as possible to achieve adequate image
quality, and the prescribing information of the
products as well as the institutional, regional or
national guidelines have to be respected.
6. Noncontrast techniques should be considered as
alternatives for contrast-enhanced techniques
whenever possible.
Imaging patients with cardiac devices (pacemakers and
defibrillators)
1. Safety
a. Follow manufacturer and institutional guidelines
for patients with MR-conditional devices and
non-conditional devices.
b. Patients with cardiac devices implanted < 6
weeks before the CMR scan should in general
not be scanned, unless the clinical indication is
compelling and informed patient consent is
obtained.
c. Patients with abandoned or epicardial leads
should in general not undergo scanning, unless
the clinical indication is compelling and
informed patient consent is obtained.
d. Device programming will depend upon pacer
dependence and recommendations by
electrophysiology specialists. In general, if the
patient is pacemaker dependent, the pacemaker
should be programmed to asynchronous mode
and if not pacer dependent, it should be
programmed to nonpacing or inhibited mode.
e. Devices should undergo interrogation before
and after the CMR scan.
f. Trained personnel should be available for
patient, ECG, and oxygen saturation monitoring
during the scan.
g. Resuscitative equipment should be available
close to the scanner room.
2. Imaging
a. Placing the arm associated with the side of the
pacemaker generator over the head during the
scan may improve image quality.
b. Imaging during deep inspiration may improve
image quality.
c. If significant artifact is present on bSSFP cine
imaging, gradient echo cine imaging may be
preferred.
d. To reduce device-related image artifact, wide￾band late gadolinium enhancement imaging may
be useful, particularly in the presence of an im￾planted cardiodefibrillator (ICD).
General techniques
Left ventricular (LV) structure and function
1. Scout imaging – transaxial, coronal, sagittal – these
are in general single heartbeat acquisitions acquired
in 1 breathold.

20 ml 0.4–0.8 ml/s
Kramer et al. Journal of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (2020) 22:17 Page 4 of 18

2. Transaxial (8–10 mm) set of bSSFP or fast spin
echo (FSE) images through the chest. These are
single-shot, single heartbeat images with a set ac￾quired in 1–2 breathholds.
3. Scout to line up short axis images – cine
acquisitions are preferable to single shot as long
axis motion and inflow should be visualized
a. LV two chamber (vertical) long axis prescribed
orthogonal to transaxial scouts aligned through
the apex and center of the mitral valve (Fig. 1)
b. Four chamber (horizontal) long axis aligned
orthogonal to the 2 chamber long axis, passing
through the center of the mitral valve and left
atrium and continuing through the long axis of
the LV. (Fig. 1)
4. bSSFP is the method of choice for cine imaging as
it provides high SNR and excellent contrast
between myocardium and blood pool
a. At 3 T, SSFP cine images may be compromised
by artifact and spoiled gradient-echo sequences
can be considered as an alternative
b. Strategies to reduce or move banding artifact
include shimming, reducing the TR, and
adjusting the RF frequency (frequency ‘scout’
sequence can be helpful for this)
c. Cine images are acquired during a breath-hold.
Breath-hold on expiration provides more con￾sistent positioning but inspiratory breath-hold
may be more comfortable and easier to sustain
for some patients.
5. bSSFP short axis cine images (Fig. 2)
a. Acquired from the base of the LV through the
apex.
b. The first short-axis cine plane should be
planned using the 4- and 2-chamber long-axis
views, and it should be perpendicular to the
long-axis of the body of the LV. This plane
might not always be parallel to the mitral
valve plane.
c. Slice thickness 6–8 mm, with or without 2–4
mm interslice gaps (to make a total of 10
mm).
d. Temporal resolution ≤45 ms between phases to
optimize evaluation of wall motion
e. Parallel imaging or compressed sensing used as
available to shorten scan time.
6. bSSFP long axis cine images
a. The 4-chamber long-axis view is prescribed
from the 2-chamber long-axis view through the
apex and center of the mitral and tricuspid
valves. This can be modified and/or cross￾checked on basal short-axis views, to have the
plane cross the acute margin of the right ven￾tricular (RV) free wall and perpendicular to the
interventricular septum.
b. The 2-chamber LV view is prescribed from the
vertical long-axis scout already acquired with
modification to pass through the anterior and
inferior myocardial walls.
c. The 3-chamber LV view is prescribed passing
through the apex, the center of the mitral valve
and aligned with the center of LV outflow tract
(LVOT) to aortic valve, as seen on a basal short
axis cine. (Fig. 3)
d. Optional – more than 3 long axis views can be
obtained.
7. Real-time cine imaging (optional)
a. To assess ventricular interdependence or for
patients with irregular rhythms or inability to
breathhold that preclude standard gated cine
imaging, real-time cine imaging (using a var￾iety of different k-space acquisition ap￾proaches) may be used to assess LV function.
b. Temporal resolution ≤60 ms between phases is
preferable if available.
c. Absolute LV volume quantification is not always
possible using real-time cine imaging as quanti￾tation is typically less accurate and precise.

Kramer et al. Journal of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (2020) 22:17 Page 6 of 18

Right ventricular (RV) structure and function
1. RV short-axis views can be obtained in a similar
fashion to LV structure and function. If the short￾axis is used for quantification, it is important to
place the basal short axis slice immediately on the
myocardial side of the RV.
2. Long-axis images should include an RV vertical
long-axis view aligned with tricuspid valve inflow
and an RV outflow tract view (sagittal or oblique sa￾gittal plane through the pulmonary valve). (Fig. 4)
3. Transaxial stack of cines covering the RV can be
considered as an alternative for RV volumetry. (Fig.
4)
First pass perfusion
1. Scout imaging as per LV structure and function
2. Pulse sequences: Typically saturation-recovery im￾aging with bSSFP, gradient echo (GRE), or GRE￾echo planar (GRE-EPI) hybrid readout
3. Short-axis view imaging (at least 3 slices per heart
beat) (Fig. 5)
a. For ischemia evaluation, should obtain data
every heart beat, if possible.
b. Slice thickness 8–10 mm
c. Parallel imaging, if available
d. In-plane resolution, ~ < 3 mm
e. Readout temporal resolution ~ 100–125 ms or
shorter as available
f. Contrast is given (0.05–0.1 mmol/kg, 3–7 ml/s)
followed by at least 30 ml saline flush (3–7 ml/sec)
g. Breathhold starts before contrast reaches the LV
cavity.
h. Acquire sufficient number of images to ensure
contrast has passed through the LV
myocardium (typically at least 50–60 heart
beats, but patients with low cardiac output may
require more images to be acquired)
i. Optional - Images may also be obtained free
breathing, particularly if motion correction
sequences are available.
Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE)
1. Pulse sequences:
Fig. 4 Top left – Axial black blood scout image through the pulmonary artery. Planning of the RV outflow tract (RVOT) view is shown by the
yellow line. Top right – RVOT cine image. Planning of axial stack of images is shown by the yellow lines. Bottom panel – 6 sequential axial images
are shown from the RVOT (top left) to the inferior pole of the RV (bottom right)
Kramer et al. Journal of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (2020) 22:17 Page 7 of 18

a. 2D segmented inversion recovery GRE or
bSSFP, Phase-Sensitive Inversion-Recovery
(PSIR), or 3D sequences are preferred in appro￾priate patients with satisfactory breathholding
ability and if SNR is sufficient.
b. Single-shot imaging (bSSFP readout) performed
as an optional second set or as backup for
patients with irregular heart beat, and/or
difficulty breath holding.
2. Need at least 10 min wait after GBCA injection (for
dosing see Table 1). Note - the delay may be < 10
min if lower gadolinium doses are used as blood
pool signal falls below that of late enhanced
myocardium. Images are generally acquired during
diastolic standstill. Also note – if stress and rest
perfusion imaging is performed, the wait should
only be approximately 5 min after the 2nd injection
of contrast.
3. Same views as for cine imaging (short- and long￾axis views) (Fig. 6)
4. Slice thickness, same as for cine imaging
5. In-plane resolution, ~ 1.4–1.8 mm
Fig. 5 Three short axis images (apex at top, mid in the middle, and
base at the bottom) acquired during the first pass of gadolinium
based contrast agent (GBCA) through the myocardium. Note the
perfusion defect in the lateral wall in the mid and basal slices
Fig. 6 Four-chamber long axis inversion recovery gradient echo late
gadolinium enhanced image from a patient with a 50–75%
transmural apical septal and apical myocardial infarction
Kramer et al. Journal of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (2020) 22:17 Page 8 of 18

6. Acquisition duration per R-R interval below 200 ms,
but should be less in the setting of tachycardia to
avoid image blurring.
7. Inversion time (TI) set to null normal myocardium.
A “TI scout”, which is a cine sequence with an
inversion pulse that is played at the beginning of
the R-wave, can be used as a rough guide to set the
TI. However, the TI scout sequence usually does
not have the identical readout parameters as the
segmented LGE sequence and hence the correct TI
may be up to 50 ms different between the two se￾quences. Alternatively, a PSIR sequence can be
used, which obviates the need for a precise setting
of the TI.
a. Imaging using a “long-inversion” time (~ 550 ms
at 1.5 T and 850 ms at 3 T) can be helpful in
distinguishing no-reflow zones or mural
thrombus from viable myocardium.
b. Imaging using a short inversion time (~ 200 ms)
and PSIR can be helpful in distinguishing
subendocardial scar.
8. Read-out is usually every other heartbeat, but
should be modified to every heartbeat in the setting
of bradycardia (< 60 bpm), and every third heartbeat
in the setting of tachycardia (> 100 bpm) or
arrhythmia.
9. Dark-blood LGE imaging (optional)
a. If available, flow independent “dark-blood”
techniques may be helpful in differentiating
subendocardial LGE from blood-pool compared
with conventional LGE imaging.
b. Settings, except for inversion time (which is set
according to the specific sequence that is used),
are similar to conventional LGE imaging.
Stress perfusion (vasodilator)
1. LV structure and function (alternatively this can be
performed between stress and rest perfusion,
although performance immediately after GBCA
infusion may reduce the contrast of the blood￾endocardium interface)
2. Adenosine stress perfusion imaging. Option – initial
adenosine infusion may be performed with the
patient outside the bore of the scanner, and move
the patient inside for the second half of the
infusion.
a. First pass perfusion
b. During last minute of adenosine, GBCA is
injected
c. Use same approach for dipyridamole
3. Alternatively: Regadenoson stress perfusion imaging
(bolus injection of 0.4 mg).
a. First pass perfusion
b. Approximately 45–60 s after regadenoson
injection, inject GBCA
4. Rest Perfusion
a. Need at least 10 min wait for to wash out from
stress perfusion imaging. During this period cine
imaging can be completed (e.g., long-axis views).
b. Perfusion imaging repeated without adenosine/
regadenoson using same dose of GBCA
c. Depending on institutional policy and
experience, rest perfusion can be omitted. There
is increasing data that rest scanning adds little
information and should be omitted whenever
possible.
d. Additional GBCA may be given as needed for
late gadolinium enhancement (for a total of 0.1–
0.2 mmol/kg)
5. Late Gadolinium Enhancement
a. Need to wait at least 5 min after rest perfusion if
performed
6. Optional - Quantitative perfusion imaging
a. Consider using a dual bolus or dual sequence
approach to reduce the effect of nonlinearity
between contrast agent concentration and signal
intensity.
b. Consider adding proton density images before
the contrast injection. This can be used as
baseline correction for full quantification but
requires specific scanner software that may not
be available on all scanners.
Stress function (dobutamine or exercise)
1. LV structure and function
2. Dobutamine stimulation (See 1.2, Stress agents)
a. Increase the dobutamine in increments of 10 μg/
kg body weight/minute every 3 min starting at
10 μg/kg body weight/minute until the target
heart rate [85% x (220-age)] is reached.
b. Add atropine in 0.5 mg incremental doses if the
heart rate response is inadequate.
c. Repeat 3 short-axis and 3 long-axis cine views
during each increment. These can be obtained
with breathhold or real-time at lower heart
rates, but at higher heart rates, breathhold ac￾quisitions are recommended due to the ability
to improve the temporal resolution.
d. Continuous ECG monitoring and blood
pressure measured during each stage.
e. View cine loops immediately after they are
acquired.
f. Adapt the bSSFP cine sequence to optimize
temporal resolution as needed as the heart rate
increases.
Kramer et al. Journal of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (2020) 22:17 Page 9 of 18

g. Stop the test for a new wall motion abnormality,
a serious side effect, or achievement of the
target heart rate.
3. Alternative – treadmill exercise with a CMR￾compatible treadmill in the scanner room with im￾aging (3 short-axis and 3 long-axis cine views) per￾formed at baseline and after peak exercise. The
temporal resolution of the bSSFP cine sequence will
need to be shortened for the post-exercise scans.
4. Alternative – supine bicycle exercise with a
CMR-compatible ergometer in the scanner room/
scan table with imaging (3 short-axis and 3 long￾axis cine views) performed at baseline and after
peak exercise. The temporal resolution of the
bSSFP cine sequence will need to be shortened
for the post-exercise scans.
Blood flow quantitation
1. Usually performed as part of other cardiovascular
protocols. Available scout images can be used. Best
if vessel of interest is depicted in two orientations
or MRA can be reformatted on the scanner for
further planning (e.g., additional bSSFP, contrast
enhanced (CE)-MRA, or single-shot black blood
scouts are helpful)
2. Sequence: one-direction (“through-plane”) motion￾encoded cine gradient echo sequences are typically
applied (Fig. 7)
3. For optimal results, the imaging plane should be
a. centered in the vessel of interest
b. aligned orthogonally to the expected main blood
flow direction in two spatial directions
c. centered in the iso-center of the scanner
4. Imaging parameters: slice thickness 5-8 mm; in￾plane resolution at least 1/10th of the vessel diam￾eter. Velocity encoding sensitivity (Venc) has to be
adapted to the expected velocities – the lowest
available velocity without aliasing should be used.
After each scan, phase difference images have to be
checked for aliasing. If aliasing is present, Venc set￾tings need to be increased accordingly. If available,
a velocity scout may allow optimal setting of the
Venc.
5. A temporal resolution of ≤50 ms between phases is
preferable. The temporal resolution should be
calculated as the time between frames that are
actually acquired. Many vendors allow the creation
of extra frames by image interpolation, which only
improves the temporal resolution artificially.
Retrospective gating covers the entire cardiac cycle
and is more convenient, but may obscure
inaccuracies related to arrhythmia.
6. For read-out, k-space segmentation over multiple
heart beats is used to limit the acquisition time
to a breath hold period. Alternatively, navigator￾based non-breathhold techniques can be applied
to improve the temporal or spatial resolution if
necessary. Also, free-breathing approaches with
multiple signal averages (NEX, NSA) have been
proven useful in patients with limited breathhold￾ing capabilities.
7. The echo time (TE) should be set to shortest,
particularly when stenoses are imaged.
8. If available, consider a 4D Flow CMR acquisition.
4D Flow CMR is becoming more readily
available, it has been shown to provide unique
insight in and select clinical settings.
Fig. 7 Velocity-encoded flow quantitation sequence acquired at the sinotubular junction in a patient with aortic stenosis. The initial sequence
(Magnitude [left] and velocity [center] images) was acquired with a VENC of 250 cm/sec, which was too low, as aliasing (red arrow) is evident. The
sequence was reacquired (right) with a VENC upward adjusted to 350 cm/sec, and aliasing is no longer present

Advanced tissue characterization
The area of tissue characterization is a rapidly develop￾ing field and the pulse sequences available on different
vendor platforms vary significantly. The acquisitions are
similar between 1.5 T and 3 T, although measured values
are often different and may also be site specific. Thus,
listed below are general guidelines only as
standardization continues to advance. Normal values
should be developed at individual institutions. Manual
shimming prior to imaging should be considered for op￾timal performance, particularly at 3 T. For detailed rec￾ommendations, please see [7].
1. T1 mapping
a. Native T1 mapping is performed in the absence
of contrast agents.
b. Look Locker imaging (modified Look Locker
Inversion recovery (MOLLI) or shortened
MOLLI (ShMOLLI) or equivalent) should be
used.
c. Diastolic acquisition is best with the exception
of atrial fibrillation in which systolic acquisition
may be preferred. In patients with higher heart
rates, specific sequences designed for these heart
rates should be used.
d. Source images should be checked for motion/
artifact and imaging repeated if this occurs.
e. Slice thickness: 6–8 mm, in-plane resolution ~
1.6–2.0 mm
f. The number and orientation of slices obtained
will depend upon the indication. At least one
short-axis map should always be obtained.
g. For extracellular volume measurements, T1
mapping should be performed prior to contrast
and at least 1 time point between 10 and 30 min
post contrast bolus
h. The hematocrit should be measured, ideally
within 24 h of imaging, for the most accurate
extracellular volume fraction (ECV)
measurement.
2. T2 mapping and T2-weighted (T2w) imaging
a. Mapping - if quantitation is desired and
sequence is available
i. Multiple alternatives exist, such as T2-prepared
single-shot bSSFP sequence acquired with
different T2 prep time, gradient and spin echo
(GraSE) or FSE-based pulse sequences.
ii. Motion correction as needed
iii. Slice thickness: 6-8 mm, in plane-resolution
~ 1.6–2.0 mm
iv. The number and orientation of slices
obtained will depend upon the indication.
Short-axis maps should always be obtained.
b. T2w Imaging
i. Black blood T2w short Tau inversion
recovery (STIR)
1. Potential pitfalls – bright signal in areas
of low flow, signal dropout due to
motion, and low signal in regions with
intramyocardial hemorrhage.
ii. Bright blood T2w sequences
1. T2-prepared single-shot bSSFP sequence
2. FSE-bSSFP hybrid is an alternative
3. Potential pitfall – bright signal may
obscure endocardial border
3. T2* mapping
a. T2* images should be obtained prior to contrast
administration.
b. The pulse sequence is a single breathhold,
gradient-echo, multi-echo scan with a series of
6–9 echo times beginning at ~ 2 msec and ex￾tending to ~ 18 msec, with each echo iteratively
spaced by ~ 2 msec. A delay time of 0 msec after
the R wave typically is used.
c. Optional - In patients with severe iron
deposition a pulse sequence with shorter echo
spacing could be helpful to accurately determine
T2* values: a series of 6–9 echo times beginning
at ~ 1 msec and extending to ~ 12 msec, with
each echo iteratively spaced by ~ 1 msec.
d. A single mid-ventricular short-axis image is
acquired.
e. Slice thickness of 8–10 mm; in-plane resolution,
~ 1.6–3.0 mm
f. (Optional) An imaging sequence similar to the
above, though non-ECG-gated, is acquired in
the axial orientation through the mid portion of
the liver to evaluate hepatic iron deposition.
The absence of ECG-gating will allow for closer
spacing of iteratively advanced echo times, and
therefore a greater number of echoes will be
acquired.
Rapid protocols
Rapid protocols have been developed for 1.5 T scanners
and have been successfully applied for cardiomyopathy
evaluations. In addition to cardiomyopathies, additional
indications for which rapid protocols could be applied
include chronic ischemic heart disease to assess viability
and hypertensive heart disease, This protocol minimizes
exam times and maximizes cost-effectiveness. The
protocol as tested is as follows:
1. Localizers, 2 chamber scout image, 3 slice short axis
stack scout images, and a transverse dark blood
single shot FSE stack for anatomic evaluation.
2. Cine imaging: four, two, three chamber and aortic
valve segmented k-space cine acquisitions.
Kramer et al. Journal of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (2020) 22:17 Page 11 of 18

3. Contrast injection of appropriate dose of GBCA
4. Cine imaging: short-axis cine stack (7-mm slice
thickness, 3 mm interslice gap) segmented k-space
cine acquisitions.
5. LGE imaging:
a. Optional sequence to determine optimal
inversion time
b. Segmented k-space LGE acquisitions in standard
long axis and short axis planes with phase sensi￾tive and magnitude reconstructions.

f. Parallel acquisition recommended (multichannel
surface coil needed)
Alternative: dual injection protocol
1. Single dose of GBCA: time-resolved MRA of the
calf and foot vessels
2. Single dose of GBCA: abdominal and thigh vessels
Alternative: Non-contrast MRA technique
Non-contrast MRA is rapidly evolving and modifica￾tions of older methods as well as new techniques are
constantly proposed. Some techniques are available for
most clinical CMR systems; however as with other se￾quences, a vendor-specific nomenclature makes general
statements difficult. Additionally, many newer tech￾niques are only offered by a limited number of vendors
as commercial products.
1. “Fresh Blood Imaging” where two ECG-triggered
3D fast (turbo) spin-echo sequences are performed
with the first gated to systole and the second to dia￾stole. Subtraction of the systolic image from the
diastolic image set results in an arterial-only image
dataset. This is techniques is available for most clin￾ical CMR systems using different vendor-specific
acronyms.
a. Slice thickness ~ 2 mm; acquired spatial
resolution in-plane 0.6–0.8 mm
b. Slices – typically 40, as needed to accommodate
vessels of interest
c. Parallel acquisition recommended (multichannel
surface coil needed)
2. 3D bSSFP with an inversion preparation pulse,
which provides suppression of background tissue,
and with an appropriate TI, allows for the inflow of
arterial blood from outside the inversion recovery
prepared volume and into the region of interest
providing high arterial signal. This is more suited
toward smaller volume acquisitions
a. Volume acquired: ~ 340 × 300 × 70; acquired
spatial resolution ~ 1.3 × 1.3 × 1.4
Kramer et al. Journal of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (2020) 22:17 Page 14 of 18

3. Quiescent Interval slice selective (QISS) MRA is a
cardiac gated 2D multi-slice inflow technique, ac￾quired in multiple groups of axial slices with incre￾mental table movement and coverage from pelvis to
feet. The sequence uses magnetization preparation

sequence:
a. Transaxial slices spanning from level of
proximal main pulmonary artery down to the
middle of the right atrium (entire cardiac
coverage if desired). Slice thickness 1–-1.5 mm;

or less. Fat suppression is typically used.
b. Slices – typically 50–-80, as needed to
encompass vessels of interest

according to observed quiescent coronary
period
d. Parallel acquisition preferred
e. Navigator placed over the right hemi-diaphragm
f. Optional – GBCA may increase vessel
conspicuity if the contrast agent was
administered previously as part of the scan. Due
to the relatively long scan time of coronary

navigators unavailable or of poor quality
b. T2-prepared sequence may be useful to
suppress myocardial and venous signal
Pulmonary vein evaluation – pre- and post-ablation

2. Breathheld 3D contrast-enhanced MRA performed
in the coronal projection encompassing the pul￾monary veins and left atrium (greater anterior
coverage if breathholding permits)
a. Optional – oblique plane centering the
pulmonary veins can reduce slab thickness and
therefore breath hold time but will lead to less
coverage of the left atrium
b. Optional - ECG-gating. When patient has ir￾regular rhythm, readout should be synchronized
with systole (i.e. no trigger delay)
c. 2–3 volumetric acquisitions – one pre-contrast
(for subtraction), one during the first pass of
contrast administration, one (optional) after
contrast administration
d. Time-resolved multiphase MRA – acquisition

f. Slice thickness 1–2 mm; acquired spatial
resolution in-plane 1–1.5 mm

Valvular disease
Patients with artificial valves can safely undergo CMR at
1.5 and 3 T. The force exerted by the beating heart is
many-fold higher than the force exerted by the magnetic
field.
1. General approach
a. Valve morphology assessment with bSSFP cine
in the plane of the valve in question. Care must
be taken to optimize the level and angle of
imaging as described below
b. Note – if planimetry of a stenotic valve is to be
attempted, a contiguous or slightly overlapping
stack of cine imaging transecting the line of the
jet and moving from orifice level to immediately
downstream is recommended. Planimetry is
most likely to be valid where the cross section
of the orifice, or rather of the jet, is clearly
delineated.
c. GRE or hybrid GRE-EPI may visualize regurgi￾tant jets with a higher sensitivity (for qualitative
purposes only)

acquisition is essential to cover the entire
cardiac cycle

7. LGE
a. Images with the TI set to null thrombus
(approximately 500–-550 ms at 1.5 T, 850–-900
ms at 3 T) will help differentiate thrombus from

surrounding or associated with tumor
b. Serial imaging can help distinguish
hypoperfused tumor necrotic core from
thrombus
