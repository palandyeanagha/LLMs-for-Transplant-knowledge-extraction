Background: While extended criteria lung donation has helped expand the lung donor pool, utilization of 
lungs from donors of at least one other solid organ is still limited to around 15–30%. Ex-vivo lung perfusion 
(EVLP) offers the ability to expand the number of useable lung grafts through assessment and reconditioning 
of explanted lungs, particularly those not initially meeting criteria for transplantation. This meta-analysis 
aimed to examine the mid- to long-term survival and other short-term outcomes of patients transplanted 
with EVLP-treated lungs versus standard/cold-storage protocol lungs.
Methods: Literature search of ten medical databases was conducted for original studies involving “ex-vivo 
lung perfusion” and “EVLP”. Included articles were assessed by two independent researchers, survival data 
from Kaplan-Meier curves digitized, and individual patient data imputed to conduct aggregated survival 
analysis. Meta-analyses of suitably reported outcomes were conducted using a random-effects model.
Results: Thirteen studies met inclusion criteria, with a total of 407 EVLP lung transplants and 1,765 as 
per standard/cold storage protocol. One study was a randomized controlled trial while the remainder were 
single-institution cohort series of varying design. The majority of donor lungs were from brain death donors, 
with EVLP lungs having significantly worse PaO2/FiO2 ratio and significantly greater rate of abnormal 
chest X-ray. Aggregated survival analysis of all included studies revealed no significant survival difference for 
EVLP or standard protocol lungs (hazard ratio 1.00; 95% confidence interval: 0.79–1.27, P=0.981). Survival 
at 12, 24, and 36 months for the EVLP cohort was 84%, 79%, and 74%, respectively. Survival at 12, 24, and 
36 months for the standard protocol cohort was 85%, 79%, and 73%, respectively. Meta-analysis did not find 
a significant difference in risk of 30-day mortality or primary graft dysfunction grade 3 at 72 hours between 
cohorts. 
Conclusions: There was no significant difference in mid- to long-term survival of EVLP lung transplant 
patients when compared to standard protocol donor lungs. The incidence of 30-day mortality and primary 
graft dysfunction grade 3 at 72 hours did not differ significantly between groups. EVLP offers the potential 
to increase lung donor utilization while providing similar short-term outcomes and mid- to long-term 
survival.

Introduction
While lung transplantation (LTx) for patients with end￾stage pulmonary disease can be a life-saving measure, the 
scarcity of suitable donor lungs results in up to 30% of these 
patients dying while on the waiting list (1,2). Obtaining 
donor organs for LTx is particularly problematic, with 
donors of at least one other solid organ only having suitable 
lungs in 15–30% of cases according to current assessment 
criteria (3-5). End-of-life care, be it in the intensive care 
unit or otherwise, often results in damage to potential grafts 
and even under optimal donor circumstances, brain death 
still has the deleterious effect of causing neurogenic edema 
and a cytokine storm-induced inflammatory response (6). 
Standard transplant protocols developed and refined 
since the 1960’s involve infusion of the donor lung with 
a specially formulated perfusate before inflation of the 
lung, stapling of the trachea, and cold preservation until 
transplantation (7). In contrast, ex-vivo lung perfusion 
(EVLP) involves continuous ventilation and perfusion of 
donor lungs, offering the potential to both extend the ability 
to functionally assess grafts, as well as recondition them 
to a transplant-suitable standard, thereby expanding the 
available pool of grafts (8). EVLP can be administered via 
several different established protocols which vary perfusate 
composition, flow, temperature, pressure, and ventilation, 
with off-the-shelf EVLP equipment such as the “XVIVO 
Perfusion System (XPS)”, “Organ Care System (OCS)”, 
and “Vivoline LS-1” now on the market (1).
While extended-criteria lungs have been shown to 
have comparable follow-up survival outcomes to standard 
criteria lungs using standard lung transplant methods, the 
use of EVLP to further expand the donor pool raises the 
question of EVLP recipient long-term outcomes (3,8,9). 
The objective of this meta-analysis was to aggregate mid￾to long-term survival data and available post-operative 
outcomes from studies comparing LTx recipients who 
received EVLP treated grafts to those receiving standard 
protocol (cold-preservation) grafts.
Methods
Literature search
Ten medical literature databases were queried from their 
dates of inception to August 2019. These included Medline, 
Embase, PubMed, and the Ovid “Evidence-Based Medicine 
Reviews” collection, which includes the Cochrane databases, 
as well as national college and government repositories. A 
broad search strategy was deliberately used, using terms 
“ex-vivo lung perfusion” (as a whole term and individually) 
and “EVLP”.
Two independent researchers (P.F. and B.M.) screened 
reference list results and full texts, with inclusion at each 
stage determined by consensus with the senior researcher 
(A.C.). Studies were included if they were comparative 
studies reporting primary mid- to long-term outcome data 
for recipients after lung transplant using standard protocol 
or EVLP. Studies needed to include at least five transplant 
recipients per arm. Non-comparative studies, animal studies, 
case reports, conference abstracts, reviews, and editorials were 
excluded. Where duplicate series exist, the study containing 
the most complete and up-to-date data was retained. The 
reference list of all included studies was examined to identify 
further articles meeting the inclusion criteria.
The primary endpoint was overall Kaplan-Meier survival 
reported to at least 6-months. Secondary endpoints were 
determined as those reported in at least half of included 
studies and included 30-day mortality, post-operative graft 
dysfunction grade 3 at 72 h, intensive care unit length of 
stay (LOS), and hospital LOS.
Quality analysis
A 19-point metric adopted from the Canadian Institute 
of Health Economics was used to assess included studies’ 
quality. This tool was designed with a Delphi methodology 
of health research stakeholders to evaluate the quality of 
case series, with examined domains including the number of 
centers data was collected from, study design, completeness 
of recipient and donor baseline data reporting, completeness 
of intraoperative and post-operative outcome reporting, 
and potential indicators of bias or conflict (Table S1). Total 
scores for each study were tallied to determine quality strata, 
with studies scoring below 12 deemed standard quality, 12 
to 14 moderate quality, and 14 to 19 high quality.
Statistical analysis
Data extraction was performed by two independent 
researchers (P.F. and B.M.) with data checking and 
validation by the senior researcher (A.C.). Where data was 
expressed as median and range or interquartile range, it was 
converted to mean and standard deviation using statistical 
methods to facilitate pooling (10,11). Furthermore, where 
no standard deviation or range was provided, a sample value 
was imputed as the mean of other provided values (12,13).

Pooling was performed using meta-analysis of proportions 
or means. Differences in baseline data and outcomes were 
summarized as relative risk (RR) and mean difference (MD) 
for proportion and continuous data, respectively, with 95% 
confidence intervals (95% CI) provided. A random effects 
model was applied for all analyses to account for between￾study variance due to recipient and donor selection, 
procedural, and care differences not accounted for in 
institutional series. Studies with zero-event outcomes in 
both arms were not weighted in meta-analysis.
Survival data was aggregated using the method for 
secondary survival analysis developed by Guyot and 
colleagues (14). This approach imputes individual patient 
time-to-event data, taking digitized Kaplan-Meier survival 
curves (Engauge Digitizer, Mark Mitchell, GitHub) 
and patient number-at-risk data as inputs. The imputed 
individual patient data is then pooled as an overall cohort 
and aggregated survival curves generated. Hazard ratio 
(HR) between EVLP and standard treatment protocol 
is calculated from Kaplan-Meier data using a Cox 
proportional hazard model (15). Proportionality was tested 
with a Schoenfeld residual test.
Publication bias was examined with funnel plots and 
also by Egger’s test for study endpoints. Heterogeneity 
amongst studies were assessed using the I2
 statistic, with 
consideration of I2
 confidence intervals (16). I2
 thresholds 
of 0–49%, 50–74%, and ≥75% were considered as low, 
moderate, and high heterogeneity, respectively (17). 
Potential sources of heterogeneity and inconsistency of 
treatment effect were identified and explored with the aid of 
leave-one-out sensitivity analyses. 
Two-tailed P values less than 0.05 were deemed 
as significant. All statistics were performed with R (R 
foundation for statistical computing, Vienna, Austria). 
Results
Literature search identified 2,252 references with 174 full￾text articles screened for inclusion. Reference list search 
of initially included articles led to the identification of one 
additional study. In all, 13 studies were included for analysis 
(PRISMA diagram provided in Figure S1) (4,5,8,18-27). 
One randomized controlled trial (RCT) was included (27), 
while four studies were prospective, non-randomized trials 
(18,20-22), six were retrospective series (4,5,8,23,25,26), and 
two were series with their design not fully described (19,24). 
One study was rated as standard quality, four as moderate 
quality, and eight as high quality (Table S2). The majority of 
studies had small EVLP cohorts, with a median cohort size 
of 14 patients, and the largest EVLP cohort of 151 patients 
contained in the RCT by Warnecke et al. All but one study 
were from European centres.
The thirteen comparative studies contained in-total 2,172 
lung transplant recipients, with 1,765 transplanted using 
standard/cold storage protocol and 407 transplanted with 
EVLP lungs. Where reported, the mean follow-up ranged 
from 0.7–10 years, with a median of 1-year follow-up.
The mean age of EVLP lung transplant recipients was 
51.3 years (95% CI: 49.7–52.9; n=385), with 53.3% males 
(95% CI: 50.0–56.5; n=884/1,640), while standard protocol 
lung transplant recipients had a mean age of 48.6 years (95% 
CI: 46.6–50.6, n=1,765), with 54.0% males (95% CI: 50.0–
58.0, n=722/1,321). The pooled recipient cohorts differed 
only in that COPD was more prevalent in the EVLP 
recipients (40.4% vs. 32.8%, P=0.046). Recipient baseline 
details and risk are summarized in Table 1 and further 
detailed in Table S3.
Despite high heterogeneity for some patient/donor 
baseline parameters, baseline data sensitivity analysis 
showed these were often due to factors such as inter￾study variation in the number of DCD donors or donor 
PaO2/FiO2 ratio. Reasons for study exclusion were not 
identified and sensitivity analysis of study endpoints did not 
demonstrate individual studies changing overall findings of 
significance (with the exception of 30-day mortality). 
Overall there were 2,178 lung donors, with 413 EVLP 
and 1,765 standard protocol donors. While not detailed 
across all studies, the majority of all grafts were from brain￾dead donors (DBD, 88.0%; 95% CI: 80.4–93.0%). Mean 
age of EVLP donors was 47.3 years (95% CI: 44.5–50.1; 
n=359) and standard donors, 45.6 years (95% CI: 43.4–47.8; 
n=1,360). As expected with EVLP’s application for graft 
reconditioning, EVLP donors had significantly greater rates 
of abnormal chest X-ray [62.0%; (95% CI: 48.2–74.1%), 
versus 36.6% (95% CI: 25.6–49.2%), P=0.011], and poorer 
PaO2/FiO2 ratio [287 mmHg (95% CI: 217–358) versus 
439 mmHg (95% CI: 427–451), P<0.001]. This difference 
in PaO2/FiO2 was further accentuated when the pooled 
PaO2/FiO2 included only studies that provided pre-EVLP 
values of PaO2/FiO2 (excluding Warnecke et al.): EVLP 
272 mmHg (95% CI: 218–326, n=190), versus, standard 
440 mmHg (95% CI: 426–454, n=1,126), MD −154 mmHg 
(95% CI: −214 – −94.3], I2
=95%, P<0.001). Pooled donor 
baseline details are provided in Table 2 and per-study data 
in Table S4.
The mean EVLP time was 234 min (95% CI: 215−253,

n=294). EVLP was performed using the proprietary XVIVO 
system (XVIVO, Denver, CO, USA) in five studies, Vivoline 
LS-1 (Vivoline Medical AB, Lund, Sweden) in three studies, 
Organ Care System (OCS-TransMedics Inc., Boston, MA, 
USA) in two studies, and not-fully described or administered 
with custom circuits in four studies (Table S5). The majority 
of patients received double-lung transplants. Intraoperative 
parameters were similar between EVLP and standard 
protocol groups (Table 3).
The primary outcome of Kaplan-Meier survival was 
reported from 12 to 120 months. Survival data in the single 
RCT was only available for the per-protocol, rather than 
the intention-to-treat, population, hence, the number at risk 
is reduced from the total number of patients reported for 
baseline and intraoperative data (27). Aggregated survival 
for individual patient data demonstrated almost identical

survival profiles for both EVLP and standard/cold storage 
protocol lung transplant recipients. Survival at 12, 24, and 
36 months for the EVLP cohort was 84%, 79%, and 74%, 
respectively, compared to 85%, 79%, and 73%, for the 
same time periods in the standard protocol cohort. Cox 
proportional hazard analysis demonstrated a hazard ratio of 
1.00 (95% CI: 0.79–1.27; P=0.981; Figure 1).
Leave-one-out analysis of Kaplan-Meier data was 
conducted to examine the sensitivity of Kaplan-Meier and 
hazard ratio results to individual patient data from each 
study. No single study was found to significantly influence 
survival outcomes. The aggregated survival curves from the 
non-randomized studies (and no matching between arm— 
excluding Warnecke et al.) is provided in Figure S2 (HR 1.16; 
95% CI: 0.89–1.51; P=0.276). 
Operative outcomes were inconsistently reported across 
included studies, with only 30-day mortality, primary graft

ICU LOS, and hospital LOS reported for the majority of 
studies. The 30-day mortality was similar between EVLP 
and standard cohorts, RR 2.04 (95% CI: 0.88–4.72, I2

Discussion
This meta-analysis combined results from 13 different 
studies detailing mid- to long-term survival data to 
demonstrate that there was no significant survival difference 
for transplant recipients receiving donor lungs treated with 
EVLP versus standard/cold storage protocol lungs. Neither 
30-day mortality or grade 3 primary graft dysfunction at 
72 h post-transplant (PGD3 at 72 h) were found to differ 
significantly between EVLP and standard cohorts.
The direction of primary and secondary outcomes of this 
meta-analysis were found to be concordant with all included 
studies, with the exception of the INSPIRE RCT, which 
identified a significantly greater 30-day mortality in the 
EVLP group but also a significant reduction in PGD3 at 
72 h for EVLP patients. The authors of that study 
accounted for the significant 30-day mortality signal as non￾EVLP related (due to iatrogenic surgical complications, 
patients’ compliance with medications, and patients’ cardiac 
risk factors) and this led to that outcome’s exclusion from 
this meta-analysis (27). 
The PaO2/FiO2 threshold for acceptance of donor grafts 
varies between centres (22), as well as how this value is 
measured (for example, variations in time points, positive 
end expiratory pressure). However, this was not shown to 
significantly affect overall survival outcomes between EVLP 
and standard protocol lungs at a meta-analysis level, nor 
within included studies, which included donor lungs with 
pre-EVLP pooled mean PaO2/FiO2 value of 272 mmHg 
[and as low as 150 mmHg (4)]. Collectively, this information 
could be used to shape EVLP donor acceptance criteria 
and potentially further increase the number of donor lungs 
accepted for EVLP, for example from DCD donors, who 
typically have worse PaO2 values (4,23,25). The divergent 
but statistically non-significant survival curves evidenced 
with the removal of the RCT (Figure S2) likely reflect the 
fact that the INSPIRE RCT made up a large proportion 
of the pooled EVLP cohort and required both EVLP and 
standard donor groups to have similarly high PaO2/FiO2
ratios for acceptance. This was in contrast to the other 
included studies, where EVLP was used for reconditioning 
grafts with poorer pre-EVLP PaO2/FiO2 ratios. 
PGD3 at 72 hours has been found to correlate with 
increased 30-day, 90-day, and 1-year mortality (26,28), 
as well as chronic lung allograft dysfunction (27). While 
the reduction in PGD3 at 72 h was only significant in the 
INSPIRE RCT, a reduced incidence of PGD3 at 72 h in 
EVLP transplant recipients was a finding shared by several 
other included studies (5,18,26). Though these studies’ 
findings on PGD3 did not reach significance and had 
smaller cohorts than the RCT, they all noted an absence 
of PGD3 events in their EVLP recipients, and other non￾zero event studies similarly noted non-significant lower 
incidences. This was the case despite a worse PaO2/FiO2
in the meta-analysis EVLP donor group and in individual 
studies, where poorer PaO2/FiO2 donor lungs were accepted 
for EVLP treatment. Unlike other included studies, the 
INSPIRE RCT was exceptional in its exclusion of donors 
with PaO2/FiO2 <300 mmHg for both EVLP and standard 
groups. Although PGD3 was a secondary outcome in 
this meta-analysis, it’s non-significant difference between 
EVLP and standard groups in combination with the non￾significant survival difference at follow-up is potentially 
valuable, as it adds weight to the restorative ability of EVLP 
and its potential for good long-term outcomes. 
Other secondary outcomes examined and commented 
upon in many studies were post-transplant extubation time 
and ICU length of stay, with concerns that using high-risk 
lungs for EVLP may lead to an increase in these parameters 
and their associated risks (8,23). Pooling of these continuous 
outcomes was precluded by heterogeneity in reporting and 
a need to impute data for the majority of included studies. 
While the limitations of vote counting in meta-analysis are 
acknowledged (29), only one of thirteen included studies 
found significantly longer extubation times and ICU length 
of stay for EVLP (22). 
While the constituent studies of this meta-analysis 
applied varying EVLP protocols and methodologies, it is 
clear that EVLP provides the ability to expand the pool of 
available donor lungs by reconditioning and reassessing 
lungs not considered suitable under standard criteria lung 
transplant. Using marginal lungs under extended-criteria 
for standard protocol lung transplant has been reported as 
doubling utilization rates to around 30–40% (30,31). Using 
EVLP however, studies in the present analysis reported 
conversion rates from EVLP evaluated lungs to transplant 
ranging from 34% to 97% (8,20,21,23,24,26). This allowed 
increased donor utilization, ranging from 33% to 50% 
(8,22,23). Along with the non-significant differences in 
outcomes found in this meta-analysis, this demonstrates

the real possibility of EVLP to reduce the number of lung 
transplant wait-list deaths. Additionally, it adds weight to 
the argument that satisfactory results can be obtained with 
more than one EVLP protocol (22).
This meta-analysis is potentially limited by it being 
largely comprised of institutional series, however, RCT in 
this area are difficult since transplanting initially rejected 
or marginal (beyond extended criteria) donor lungs as 
a control arm would be ethically difficult to justify (21). 
Although statistical heterogeneity was low in meta-analysis 
endpoints, it remained moderate to high for some baseline 
and intraoperative characteristics. This heterogeneity is 
likely due to differences in centers’ donor criteria and 
operative methods (for example, single versus double lung), 
and sensitivity analysis did not demonstrate an effect on 
significance of outcomes. This does not however, mean 
that all sources of heterogeneity were able to be accounted 
for and the authors acknowledge that even where I2
 point 
values were low, I2
 confidence intervals often still included 
at least moderate heterogeneity values (16). Additionally, 
many studies were retrospective and included a range of 
recruitment years and recruitment period lengths. As EVLP 
methodology and knowledge (and lung transplant more 
broadly) is a rapidly-evolving field, this may have introduced 
some learning-curve type confounding effect (25).
Conclusions
Aggregated patient survival data analysis of EVLP 
and standard/cold-storage lung transplant recipients 
demonstrated no significant difference in survival at mid￾to long-term follow-up. Meta-analysis demonstrated lungs 
accepted for EVLP had significantly lower PaO2/FiO2
ratio and a greater incidence of radiographic abnormality, 
however, this did not translate to a significant difference 
in overall survival, 30-day mortality, or primary graft 
dysfunction grade 3 at 72 h between EVLP and standard 
cohorts. EVLP offers the ability to expand the lung donor 
pool with acceptable mid- to long-term survival outcomes.
