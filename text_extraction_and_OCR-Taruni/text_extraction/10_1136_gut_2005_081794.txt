Background and aims: Immunosuppressive therapy with intravenous ciclosporin is an alternative
treatment option to total colectomy for patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), while the benefits of oral
administration of tacrolimus are not well defined and are based on reports of several uncontrolled studies.
Methods: Patients with refractory active UC were randomly assigned to a high trough concentration (10–
15 ng/ml) group (HT group) (n = 21), low trough concentration (5–10 ng/ml) group (LT group) (n = 22),
or placebo group (n = 20). Patients received an initial oral dose of 0.05 mg/kg tacrolimus or placebo
twice daily. Efficacy was evaluated in 60 patients based on a disease activity index (DAI) score. Fifty eight
patients had additional treatment with tacrolimus and were evaluated for efficacy in a 10 week open label
extension.
Results: An improvement in DAI score (>4 points, all categories improved) was observed for 68.4% of
cases in the HT group compared with 10.0% in the placebo group (p,0.001). In the HT group, 20.0% of
patients had clinical remission and 78.9% had mucosal healing. In the open label extension, 55.2% of
all patients had an improved DAI score at week 10. Mean dose of prednisolone was reduced from
19.7 mg/day at study entry to 7.8 mg/day at week 10. The incidence of side effects in the HT group was
significantly higher than that of the placebo group (p = 0.043). The most common event was mild finger
tremor.
Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate dose dependent efficacy and safety of oral tacrolimus for
remission-induction therapy of refractory UC. The optimal target range appears to be 10–15 ng/ml in
terms of efficacy with two week therapy.
T
acrolimus (FK506) is an immunosuppressive macrolide
isolated from fermentation broth of Streptomyces tsuku￾baensis. It potently inhibits helper T lymphocyte activa￾tion. In fact, tacrolimus has been shown to inhibit
transcription of the early activation genes for cytokines such
as interleukin 2 (IL-2), tumour necrosis factor a (TNF-a), and
interferon c (IFN-c) in T cells. Its immunosuppressive effect
appears to be mediated, in part, through inhibition of IL-2
synthesis and release, as well as a decrease in the number of
IL-2 receptors on activated lymphocytes.1 2
Furthermore, in vitro studies have demonstrated that
steroid resistance is due to the intrinsic properties of T
lymphocytes and involves IL-2 and the IL-2 receptor, with
steroid resistant lymphocytes producing higher levels of IL-2.3
Although its mode of action is similar to that of ciclosporin
(CsA), the immunosuppressive effect is 30–100 times greater
in vitro and 10–20 times greater in vivo than that of CsA.4
Also, its intestinal absorption is more consistent even in the
presence of gastrointestinal disease.5 In renal transplantation,
tacrolimus is associated with fewer acute rejections, lower
steroid requirements, fewer graft failures, and a better
adverse event profile than CsA.6 7
Intravenous CsA is an alterative treatment option to
surgery for patients with severe steroid refractory ulcerative
colitis (UC).8–10 In contrast, high intra- and interpatient
variability in blood levels limits the efficacy of oral CsA ,
although a new formulation (microemulsion CsA) has
reported to be useful in a limited number of studies.11
Recently, the anti-TNF-a, infliximab which is administered
intravenously, has been proved to be a useful biological
therapy for the treatment of moderately to severely active
UC.12–18 Any drug requiring intravenous administration has a
higher potential for serious adverse events and prolonged
hospitalisation than those administered orally.
Tacrolimus has been reported to be effective for patients
with Crohn’s colitis and intestinal fistulae.19–22 To date,
several uncontrolled studies have shown that tacrolimus
can induce remission in adults5 23–25 and in children26 with
steroid refractory UC. We report the results of a placebo
controlled double blind study of oral tacrolimus therapy
designed to assess the efficacy and safety of two target
tacrolimus blood concentration ranges and its open label
extension in patients with refractory moderately/severely
active UC.
METHODS
Patient selection
Patients with moderately/severely active UC were eligible for
this study. UC was defined by standard symptomatic,
radiographic, and endoscopic criteria.27 All patients in this
study were hospitalised and afflicted with left sided colitis
(except for proctosigmoiditis) or pancolitis. The extent of
colonic involvement was determined by total colonoscopy.
Before the start of treatment, infectious diarrhoea was ruled
out by stool cultures and Clostridium difficile toxin testing.
Endoscopies were done within one week prior to the first
dose of study drug.
Steroid resistance was defined as unresponsiveness to oral
or intravenous corticosteroid therapy (equivalent to a daily
dose of more than 30 mg of prednisolone) over at least two

weeks, and steroid dependency was defined as either chronic
active UC for more than six months or frequent recurrence
(more than once a year, or three times or more every two
years regardless of intensive medical therapy). Patients were
permitted to continue taking drugs containing 5-aminosal￾icylic acid or steroids during the study as long as the dosage
of these drugs was not adjusted during the period two weeks
prior to the start of the study through to the end of the study.
Patients with known renal or severe hepatic dysfunction,
and pregnant women were excluded. Pretreatment evalua￾tions included a history and physical examination, complete
blood count, chemistry screening panel, and urinalysis.
Azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine was prohibited for
concomitant use after initiation because the indication of
UC is not covered by healthcare insurance for these drugs in
Japan. Patients taking azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, CsA,
or other immunosuppressants within three months prior to
entry were excluded from evaluation of the efficacy and
safety for tacrolimus. In addition, cytapheresis within
28 days prior to entry was also a reason for exclusion.
Protocol review
The study protocol was reviewed and approved by each
institutional review board. Each patient read and signed a
consent form before enrolment into the study.
Study design
We conducted a two week, placebo controlled, double blind,
randomised study in which patients with active UC were
administered either placebo or tacrolimus at an oral dosage to
achieve and maintain one of two target blood concentrations,
followed by an open label 10 week extension in which all
patients received tacrolimus. The total study period was
therefore 12 weeks.
Administration and monitoring of study drug
The tacrolimus capsule used (tacrolimus; Astellas Pharma
Inc., successor in interest to Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd,
Japan) contained 0.5 mg or 1 mg of FK506.
The initial oral dose of tacrolimus was 0.05 mg/kg per day
twice daily. Blood was collected for determination of
tacrolimus whole blood trough concentration at 12 hours
(C12h) or 24 hours (C24h) after the initial dose. Dosage was
adjusted in order to maintain whole blood concentrations
within the assigned target range. To preserve the blindness of
the study, blood trough levels were measured by SRL Inc. (a
third party organisation independent of the study physicians
or sponsor) and values were forwarded to Control Center
(Bellsystem24, Inc.; a third-party organisation independent
of the study physicians or sponsor). Dosages were calculated
with the trough level at the Control Center and clinical sites
were informed of the subsequent dosage by fax twice or three
times in two weeks. Patients in the placebo group were
pseudo-dose adjusted to preserve study blindness. Patients in
the tacrolimus ‘‘high trough’’ (HT) and ‘‘low trough’’ (LT)
groups were dose adjusted to achieve and maintain trough
levels of 10–15 ng/ml and 5–10 ng/ml, respectively. Dose
adjustment at the Control Center was carried out using the
equations shown in table 1; these equations were created
based on the known pharmacokinetic profile of tacrolimus in
healthy volunteers (data not shown).
In the open label extension, the trough level was adjusted
to 5–15 ng/ml during the initial stage of tacrolimus admin￾istration, and 5–10 ng/ml after attaining remission at the
treating physician’s discretion. Dosage reduction was allowed
when adverse drug reactions were observed.
Symptom assessment and study end points
The primary end point was the proportion of patients with
improvement (combination of patients with partial response
and patients with complete response) on the basis of the
disease activity index (DAI) score28 29(table 2). The DAI score
includes an objective assessment of the mucosal appearance
and patient questionnaire components. Patients recorded the
frequency of their stools, abdominal pain, and blood in stool
on diary cards. A complete response was defined as complete
resolution of all symptoms (all assessment scores were zero).
A partial response was defined as a reduction in DAI of more
than 4 points with improvement of all categories, but not a
complete response. In the event any assessment score was
noted to worsen or not change, despite improvement in other
scores, the patient was considered to have had a treatment
failure. Patients whose symptoms worsened at any time or
did not improve for more than one week (in the case of a
total DAI score >10 at baseline) were considered to be
treatment failures if the investigators assessed that the study
drug could not be continued. DAI was evaluated at weeks 0
and 2 in the double blind study, and at week 10 in the open
label extension.
The secondary end points were changes from baseline in
each category of DAI score, clinical response, and mucosal
healing. Clinical remission was defined as a DAI score (2,
with no individual subscore .1, and mucosal healing was
defined as an endoscopy subscore (>2 at entry) of 0 or 1.18
Prednisolone dose was allowed to be tapered at the treating
physician’s discretion when clinical symptoms improved after
the open label extension started. Other observations included
the number of bowel movements, visible blood in stool,
abdominal pain, body temperature, pulse rate, haemoglobin,
erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and serum C reactive
protein (CRP) level.
Statistical analysis
For demographic and other baseline variables, the x2 test or
Kruskal-Wallis test was used to assess comparability among
the three treatment groups. Variables that exhibited imbal￾ance (p,0.15) among treatment groups were included as

covariates in a secondary analysis (logistic regression) of the
primary variable to assess the effect of the imbalance.
Dunnett-type multiple comparisons was used to compare
each of the tacrolimus groups (HT group or LT group) and
placebo group for improvement rate of DAI scores, each
category of DAI scores, and other efficacy measures. Fisher’s
exact test or the Mann-Whitney U test was used for
comparison between the two tacrolimus groups (that is, HT
group and LT group). The Wilcoxon signed rank test was used
for comparison between baseline and each time point within
each group.
Logistic regression analysis was used to explore the effect
of demographic factors on the primary end point. All
statistical tests were two sided with a significance level of
0.05, unless otherwise specified.
Sample size
Improvement in DAI score with tacrolimus was assumed to be
80% based on previous results in a pilot study. Improvement in
the placebo was to be 20% based on Schroeder and colleagues.28
Based on these assumptions and a two sided alpha 0.025 and
power of 0.9, 20 randomised patients per group was estimated
using normal approximation to be sufficient to show a
difference in efficacy between placebo and tacrolimus.
RESULTS
Patient population
This study was performed between June 2002 and September
2003. A total of 65 patients in 17 centres were enrolled. Two
patients were not administered study drug after enrolment
because they failed to show confirmed visible bloody stool,
resulting in a safety population of 63 patients. Three patients
who received study drug were excluded from the efficacy
analyses; two failed to show confirmed visible bloody stool at
the start of the study and one underwent cytapheresis
therapy within the previous 28 days. Therefore, the efficacy
analysis set for the double blind study consisted of 60
patients. Six patients in the placebo group and one patient in

the tacrolimus groups (0 HT group, 1 LT group) withdrew due
to lack of efficacy (flare of symptoms or no improvement/
worsening) (fig 1).
The characteristics of the patients at baseline are shown in
table 3 and were similar in all groups. Mean duration of
disease was 4.8–6.6 years in each group. Enrolled patients
showed a total DAI score of 6 or more. Eight patients showing
lack of efficacy or relapse with azathioprine and 15 patients
showing little or no improvement after cytapheresis within
the previous six months were enrolled in the study.
Sixty one of 63 patients were given study medication in the
open label extension except for two patients who developed
serious adverse events (gastroenteritis and sepsis). Fifty eight
patients continued to receive oral tacrolimus for 10 weeks in
the open label extension study. Three patients withdrew
before 10 weeks for failure to improve, adverse event (head￾ache and fever), or patient request. No patient underwent
colectomy during the 12 week study period.
Drug exposure
In the double blind study, target tacrolimus blood trough
concentrations were achieved by day 10 in both tacrolimus
treatment groups and maintained until the end of the study
(fig 2). Thus, by using the dosage adjustment method for this
study under blind conditions, a tacrolimus trough level was
achieved at the target trough level and was well controlled.
A smooth transition into the open label extension was
achieved. Mean trough levels were 10.1 (3.9) ng/ml at week
2, 8.5 (2.5) ng/ml at week 6, and 8.8 (3.9) ng/ml at week 10,
respectively.
Clinical response
Double blind study
As shown in table 4, improvement in DAI score (> 4 points,
all categories improved) was observed in 68.4% (13/19) of
patients in the HT group, in 38.1% (8/21) in the LT group, and
in 10.0% (2/20) of patients in the placebo group. Significantly

more patients in the HT group demonstrated improvement
compared with the placebo group (p,0.001). The rate of
partial responders in patients with severe disease with a DAI
score of 10–12 was 66.7% (4/6) in the HT group, 50.0% (5/10)
in the LT group, and 18.2% (2/11) in the placebo group.
Partial response rates in steroid resistant patients were 80.0%
(4/5) in the HT group, 40.0% (2/5) in the LT group, and 20.0%
(1/5) in the placebo group.
A significantly greater percentage of patients had improve￾ment in each DAI score evaluation parameter (bowel move￾ments, blood in stool, endoscopic findings, and physician’s
global impression) in the HT group compared with those in
the placebo group. A significantly greater percentage of
patients in the LT group compared with those in the placebo
group experienced improvement with respect to bowel
movements, blood in stool, and physician’s assessment
(table 5). Clinical remission was observed in 20.0% (4/20)
and 10.5% (2/19) of the HT and LT groups compared with
5.9% (1/17) in the placebo group at week 2. Mucosal healing
was achieved in 78.9% (15/19) and 44.4% (8/18) of patients in
the HT and LT groups, respectively, compared with 12.5% (2/
16) in the placebo group at week 2.
The percentage of patients with improvement in the
number of bowel movements per day, visible blood in stool,
ESR, and CRP level was significantly greater in both
tacrolimus groups compared with placebo. There were no
statistically significant differences among treatment groups
with respect to abdominal pain, body temperature, pulse rate,

reduced from 19.7 (11.5) mg/day at study entry to 7.8
(5.9) mg/day at week 10 in all patients (p,0.001), from
33.8 (6.2) mg/day to 9.5 (5.4) mg/day in steroid resistant
patients (p,0.001) and from 14.7 (8.4) mg/day to 7.2
(5.9) mg/day in steroid dependent patients (p,0.001)
(tables 6, 7).
Adverse events to therapy
Safety was evaluated for the 63 patients who received at least
one dose of study drug. In the double blind study, adverse
events that occurred in more than 5% of patients and serious
adverse events are shown in table 8. There was no statistically
significant difference between the HT and placebo groups
(p = 0.215) in the overall incidence of adverse events but
there was a statistically significant difference (p = 0.043)
with respect to overall related events. Finger tremor was the
most common adverse event in the tacrolimus groups
One patient in the HT group developed serious viral
gastroenteritis on day 4; tacrolimus was discontinued and
the patient recovered with symptomatic therapy after four
days. Another patient in the LT group developed acinetobac￾ter sepsis on day 14 and recovered with symptomatic therapy
after eight days. Both events were considered by the
investigator to be possibly related to tacrolimus. No other
serious adverse events were observed.
No serious adverse events were reported during the
10 week extension. The most common study drug related
adverse events in patients who received tacrolimus for
10 weeks were finger tremor and headache. The incidence
of adverse events did not increase remarkably in the open
label extension study (table 8).
Decreases in serum magnesium and increases in serum
creatinine are known as common adverse drug reactions of
tacrolimus.30 Serum magnesium was decreased in seven of 21
patients (33.3%) and in three of 22 patients (13.6%) in the HT
and LT groups in the double blind study, respectively, and in
seven of 61 patients (11.5%) who received tacrolimus in the
open label extension study. However, the change was
considered to be mild by the investigators. Increase in serum
creatinine levels to .30% above baseline occurred in 4.8%
(1/21) of patients in the HT group and in 4.5% (1/22) in the
LT group in the double blind study, and in 14.8% (9/61) in the
open label extension study. One patient had an increase from
baseline to a value >1.5 mg/dl22 (1.9 mg/dl) but the patient
also had diarrhoea and dehydration. There were no other
clinically important differences among each of the treatment
groups with respect to changes in laboratory assessments.
Factors affecting clinical response
Multifactorial analysis of the various demographic factors
based on logistic regression showed no significant effect of
the patient’s age (divided into the following groups: 15–
30 years, 31–45 years, and .45 years), sex, or total disease
duration on clinical outcome.
Compliance
During this trial, patients were questioned by the investigator
about compliance. Although pills were not counted, there
were no identifiable cases of non-compliance.
DISCUSSION
This study was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of
an oral tacrolimus preparation in patients with refractory
moderately/severely active UC. The size of the study groups
was designed to permit determination of any statistically
significant difference in response rates between the HT group
and the placebo group, and a possible trend towards a
difference between the LT group and placebo groups, as to
identify statistically significant differences in response rates
among all three treatment groups would have required a
prohibitively large number of patients.
Oral tacrolimus, adjusted to a target blood trough
concentration of 10–15 ng/ml, resulted in a greater percen￾tage of patients with a partial response than placebo.
Although there was no complete responders to this treat￾ment, several patients experienced clinical remission. The LT
group achieved a rate of improvement nearly four times that
observed with placebo but the difference did not reach
statistical significance. This may have been due to a smaller
improvement in endoscopic findings although clinical symp￾toms such as diarrhoea or bloody stool in the LT group were
improved or resolved as well as that observed in the HT
group. Indeed, the ratio of patients with no visible blood in
stool was 52.6% (10/19) in the HT group, 52.4% (11/21) in the
LT group, and 15.0% (3/20) in the placebo group.
Our data suggest that oral tacrolimus is effective for patients
with severely active UC, as well as for patients with moderately
active UC. Follow up data in the open label extension study
suggest that tacrolimus has steroid sparing effects.
Most CsA protocols recommend continuous intravenous
infusion whereas tacrolimus achieved therapeutic levels if
given orally twice a day. This oral therapy might be an
effective alternative to other intravenous immunosuppressive
agents, such as CsA or Infliximab. These therapies will reduce
the number of patients who require colectomy.

Tolerance of the drug was acceptable. Adverse reactions
limited therapy in only 1 of 43 patients receiving active
medication. Previous studies on the use of tacrolimus in
inflammatory bowel disease5 19–26 reported a high frequency of
adverse events such as tremor, hyperglycaemia, hypertension,
opportunistic infections, and impaired renal function. The
rate of whole adverse events in our study was similar to that
in previous reports. However, there was no serious adverse
event observed in our study other than gastroenteritis, while
severe adverse events such as thrombocytopenia or bicyto￾penia were reported in UC23 or cardiothoracic transplanta￾tion.31 The incidence of adverse reactions did not increase
remarkably in the open label extension study. Therefore, this
therapy was well tolerated for three months.
As in transplantation, trough concentration monitoring was a
reliable means of maintaining appropriate tacrolimus blood
levels in order to individualise dosing for each patient. Median
tacrolimus doses at week 2 were 0.20 mg/kg/day (10.0 mg/day)
(min 0.08–max 0.30 mg/kg/day) in the HT group and 0.14 mg/
kg/day (6.0 mg/day) (min 0.03–max 0.29 mg/kg/day) in the LT
group. The calculation method for dose adjustment provided in
this study appeared to be useful for determining the required
dose of tacrolimus to maintain optimal blood concentrations.
To our knowledge this is the first report of a placebo
controlled, double blind, randomised trial on the efficacy of
tacrolimus in remission induction in refractory UC. The
optimal target blood trough concentration range of tacroli￾mus appears to be 10–15 ng/ml in terms of efficacy with two
week therapy. Longer term tacrolimus treatment
(.3 months) is now under investigation.

EDITOR’S QUIZ: GI SNAPSHOT ..................................................................
Robin Spiller, Editor
Catastrophic lower gastrointestinal complications following spinal surgery
Clinical presentation
A 42 year old man was admitted for surgical excision of a
malignant vascular spinal (cervical) tumour. There was no
smoking, alcohol, past medical, or family history. Regular
medications on admission were: paracetamol, diclofenac,
opioids, dexamethasone, and omeprazole. Postoperatively he
had abdominal pain, torrential fresh and altered bleeding per
rectum, with haemodynamic instability.
Urgent investigations revealed the following: haemoglobin
6.9 g/dl, white cell count 20.36109
/l, erythrocyte sedimentation
rate 19, albumin 18 g/l, and negative vasculitis screen.
Gastroscopy revealed a chronic duodenal ulcer with no stigmata
of bleeding while flexible sigmoidoscopy showed altered blood
with obscured views. Mesenteric angiogram showed normal
superior mesenteric and coeliac arteries but the inferior
mesenteric artery could not be cannulated. The day following
his angiogram the patient developed features of peritonitis on
abdominal examination. After an urgent abdominal computed
tomography (CT) scan (fig 1), an extended Hartmann’s
procedure (specimen shown in fig 2) was performed at
laparotomy that day. Following surgery the patient did not
complain of any further gastrointestinal symptoms.
Question
What does the CT of the abdomen (fig 1) and the colonic
specimen (fig 2) show to be the cause of this patient’s
symptoms?

and ribavirin in April 2005, and continued
treatment for ulcerative colitis with contin￾uous oral mesalazine and prednisolone.
Despite discontinuation of PEG-IFN and
ribavirin, the patient’s symptoms did not
change and he was hospitalised in May 2005.
The patient improved following treatment for
ulcerative colitis with mesalazine and steroid
therapy. He was discharged on 3 June 2005
and was followed and observed as an out￾patient.
We encountered a case of ulcerative colitis
apparently caused by combination therapy of
PEG-IFN and ribavirin for hepatitis C. A
literature search using Japana Centra Revuo
Medicina (keywords: interferon, ulcerative
colitis; retrieval period: 1983–2006) found
seven cases1–7 of onset and exacerbation of
ulcerative colitis caused by IFN therapy in
Japan (table 1). Conversely, a literature
search using MEDLINE (keywords: inter￾feron, ulcerative colitis) found only three
reports in English worldwide (Mitoro and
colleagues,1 Mavrogiannis and colleagues,8
and Sprenger and colleagues) (table 1).9
Moreover, only one of these cases described
exacerbation of ulcerative colitis due to
combination therapy with PEG-IFN and
ribavirin.9 Thus our patient is the second
reported case to date.
As PEG-IFN can maintain higher blood
levels than classical IFN, IFN may have a
larger effect on the immune system.
Furthermore, it has been reported that
ribavirin alters the balance of Th1/Th2 and
causes resistance to HCV by cellular immune
processes.10 Combination therapy with PEG￾IFN and ribavirin may thus have more
significant effects on immunomodulation
than classical IFN treatment.
This is a case of chronic hepatitis C with
adenomatous hyperplasia of the liver at the age
of 55 years. Antiviral therapy for chronic
hepatitis C after RFA for adenomatous hyper￾plasia might prevent future carcinogenesis in
the liver. We conclude that the benefits of
prevention of carcinogenesis in the liver by
combination therapy with PEG-IFN and riba￾virin supersede the risk of relapse and exacer￾bation of ulcerative colitis. Furthermore, we
selected the combination therapy of PEG-IFN
and ribavirin for antiviral therapy because the
patient had HCV genotype 1 infection and high
pretreatment viral burdens.
We expect the use of IFN, as an antiviral
therapy for hepatitis C, to continue to
increase. Changes to immune system regula￾tion and specific adverse reactions such as
ulcerative colitis associated with combination
therapy may be expected to occur at a
significantly higher frequency than with
monotherapy IFN. Further discussion in
needed on how to prevent adverse reactions
with combination therapy.

The aim of this revision was to update a
book originally published in 1991, with the
second edition appearing in 1998. The objec￾tive is clearly to produce a manageable
distillate of the contemporary state of clinical

gastroenterology, current standard textbooks
now being of substantial mass or multi￾volume status.
In common with the other subject volumes
in this series, it is aimed at doctors in training
(both generalists and specialists), but would
be equally valuable to other professionals
working within the field of gastroenterology,
such as nurses, physicians assistants, medical
care practitioners, etc.
The authors are a small group of respected
clinical gastroenterologists, including a
trainee. The composition and modest size of
the writing group has allowed a practical and
relevant approach and a consistency of
writing and presentation style, often lacking
in large multi-author texts.
The objective of the book is to provide clear
knowledge of guidance that would be of use
in the emergency and endoscopy rooms, the
ward round, and the clinic. Given the massive
knowledge base informing this modest sized
volume (483 pages, weight 0.9 kg), it is not
surprising that the authors have made
extensive use of bulleted lists, tables, and
diagrams. There are a useful number of
imaging studies, often accompanied by a well
labelled explanatory line drawing. What is
not included is an extensive balanced pres￾entation of the prevailing issues under
debate, addition of which would have
defeated the primary aim of producing a
practical and portable book. Those readers
with interests in the debates will have to look
to the current journals and conferences. A
reading list is provided, rather than compre￾hensive referencing of the text. This will
undoubtedly cause occasional frustration, but
referencing may have added 20–30% to the
size of the book.
The book is well laid out and it is easy to
navigate to specific topics, with individual
section contents pages, which I found partic￾ularly helpful. The first section, ‘‘alimentary
emergencies’’, seems particularly laid out
with the admitting registrar in mind, with a
good starting plan with cross referencing to
further information in the rest of the book
about detailed disease management for sub￾sequent browsing when time allows.
Have the authors succeeded in their objec￾tives? My own view is yes. Where do I see this
book sitting? Certainly not in pockets; white
coats have largely disappeared and, despite
the book’s title, an average outfit could not
accommodate this tome. I envisage a great
value for it as a resource for general medical
examination study, and I can imagine it
sitting well thumbed in junior doctor’s offices
and near patient areas, such as the emer￾gency room and the medical ward. Rather
tellingly, my husband, who runs an intensive
care unit, has just absconded with my review
copy.

‘‘We must go beyond textbooks, go
out into the bypaths and untrodden
depths of the wilderness and travel
and explore and tell the world the
glories of our journey’’ Professor
John Hope Franklin.
However, textbooks are changing too.
Electronic editions, online extensions, PDA
downloadable versions, online updates, and
enhancements such as video clips have
created a fusion of textbooks and the world￾wide web that is changing the experience and
expectations of the readership. The emerging
pressures of revalidation and recertification
of doctors via formal testing is also creating a
new demand for practical and concise text￾books. It is now possible to travel places with
a textbook and a computer.
At over 1000 pages, this textbook can
hardly be labelled concise although the
layout is extremely well organised. It uses
all of the electronic enhancements mentioned
above and is profusely illustrated with high￾lighted tables and message boxes. There are
four colour coded sections: symptoms, syn￾dromes and scenarios, diseases of the gut and
liver, primer of diagnostic methods, and
primer of treatments.
The four sections create challenges in
preventing overlap and repetitions. For exam￾ple, heartburn is covered in symptoms section
and oesophageal diseases section, with rep￾etitions in diagnostic tests of motility and
functional tests and the treatment sections.
Overall, however, the structure works reason￾ably well and the first two sections are the
strongest. There are superb chapters such as
analysis of diarrhoea, but also chapters such
as functional gastrointestinal disease which
simply lists a succession of tables. Some of
the chapters in the initial section also have
useful internet sources of information for
patients and doctors. The symptoms, syn￾dromes, and scenarios ignore an increasingly
large proportion of health care seekers who
wish to avoid risks by screening, although
asymptomatic.
Diseases of the gut and liver are organised
roughly in anatomical and conventional
order but cover the entire breadth of gastro￾intestinal and liver disorders with a superb
collection of splendidly illustrated chapters.
Some, but not all, of the chapters are state of
the art, with particularly strong coverage of
gastric malignancies and colorectal cancer. A
chapter on other gastrointestinal tumours
misses opportunities for illustrations and could
have been easily merged with a previous
chapter on gastrointestinal stromal tumours
and carcinoid tumours. Motility disorders are
well covered, including a very well balanced
chapter on irritable bowel syndrome.
In the primer of diagnostic methods, there
are some excellent chapters on endoscopic
techniques, but given the profusion of endos￾copy textbooks, it may be less useful to the
readership. However, virtual endoscopy and
the PET chapters are well written and
illustrated. Novel endoscopic imaging mod￾alities are covered somewhat too concisely. In
the primer of treatments, the chapter on
drugs used in gastrointestinal and liver
diseases is mostly repetition and redundant,
but the nutritional assessment and manage￾ment sections are strong.
The authorship is international and a
refreshing number of ‘‘rising stars’’ are
represented. The index is comprehensive.
Overall, this is a welcome addition to the
wide selection of textbooks available to
gastroenterologists and will be useful to both
trainees and experienced clinicians. It fulfils
the definition of a good book………

opened with expectation and closed
in profit’’ Amos Bronson Alcott.
