Abstract
Background: We evaluated accuracy of urinary liver type fatty acid-binding protein (L-FABP) for prediction of
early allograft function and compared it to neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin (NGAL), diuresis and urinary
creatinine excretion rate (UCr).
Methods: Urine samples from 71 consecutive patients were taken 4, 10, 24 and 48 h after transplantation. We
classified recipients into two groups: immediate graft function (IGF), with more than 70% reduction of serum Cr at
7th day post-transplant, and delayed graft function (DGF)/slow graft function (SGF) group (DGF - the need for
hemodialysis procedure in the first week, SGF - less than 70% reduction of serum Cr in the first week).
Results: Thirty-one recipients had IGF and 40 had DGF/SGF. L-FABP was only useful 48 h post-transplant with ROC
AUC of 0.85 (95% C.I. 0.74-0.92); NGAL 24 h post-transplant had ROC AUC of 0.82 (0.7-0.91). Sensitivity, specificity,
PPV and NPV for prediction of DGF/SGF with L-FABP > 9.5 mg/mmol Cr and NGAL > 33.1 μg/mmol Cr were: 86, 80,
83 and 83% (L-FABP), and 68, 93, 91, and 73% (NGAL). The difference in urine output between the groups was
largest 4 h post-transplant (p = 0.001), later on the difference diminished. There were no significant differences in
ROC AUC between L-FABP at 48 h, NGAL at 24 h, urine output at 4 h and UCr excretion rate at 10 h post-transplant.
UCr < 0.56 mmol/h 10 h post-transplant predicted DGF/SGF with 94% sensitivity, 84% specificity, 89% PPV and 91%
NPV, ROC AUC was 0.9. Classification tree with urine output 4 h and UCr 10 h post-transplant accurately predicted 89%
of outcomes. When L-FABP or NGAL were added, the prediction was accurate in 92 or 90%, respectively.
Conclusions: L-FABP is comparable to NGAL for prediction of first week allograft function, however UCr and diuresis
were non-inferior.

Background
Acute kidney injury (AKI) that occurs at transplantation
often progresses to delayed graft function (DGF) [1]. DGF
may be defined as an allograft injury that causes the use of
dialysis in the first week after transplantation [2]. It is as￾sociated with increased risk of graft loss, acute rejection
and worse allograft function [3]. While it is possible to
predict the risk of DGF through the use of many donor￾and recipient-associated factors [4], the prediction is not
perfect and markers with a better predictive value are
warranted.
In the recent years, the urine biomarkers of AKI have be￾come available. Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin
(NGAL) is a protein from lipocalin family and induced in
the renal tissue in the conditions of ischemia-reperfusion
injury, with tissue protective properties [5]. In the studies
examining its predictive capability for DGF area under the
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was between
0.75 and 0.9 [6-8], thus showing a good prognostic value
for DGF. Similar were results for urine interleukin-18
(6, 7). Another interesting marker of ischemia-reperfusion
injury is liver type fatty acid binding protein (L-FABP)

found in proximal tubular cells. During ischemic injury
L-FABP binds lipid peroxidation products and alleviates
oxidative stress [9]. It is useful for diagnosis of various
forms of AKI [10] and its urinary concentration showed an
excellent correlation with ischemia time in living-related
kidney transplantation [9]. Its possible role as a marker
and predictor of allograft function in the clinical setting of
deceased donor kidney transplantation (DDKT) has been
examined [11] but no data on exact predictive value for
early allograft function were reported so far.
When looking at studies of the predictive values of
various urinary biomarkers for early allograft function
there are several uncertainties left unanswered. It is long
known that the level of diuresis after kidney transplant￾ation is useful and perhaps one of the most clinically
used predictors of allograft function, however in many
of the studies the predictive value of urinary biomarkers
was not rigorously compared to the level of diuresis.
Often, an arbitrary level of urine output of 1 liter on day
1 post transplant was used to compare the predictive
value of diuresis to various urinary biomarkers [7,8],
however the predictive value of diuresis after transplant
may vary with time and clinical protocols of fluid and di￾uretic management. Furthermore, urinary creatinine
(UCr) concentration, another traditionally used predictor
of kidney function recovery [12], was often not reported
in these studies. Currently therefore it is hard to answer
what is the exact benefit of novel urinary biomarkers
above and beyond the traditionally used (and very cheap)
monitoring of diuresis and UCr. Finally, the normalization
of urinary biomarker to UCr concentration was variable
between studies and it is not clear if there is a consistent
benefit of normalization to UCr concentration for increas￾ing the predictive value of urine biomarkers.
We have designed this study with two main goals.
First, we wanted to examine the prognostic accuracy of
urinary L-FABP for early allograft function in deceased
donor kidney transplantation and to compare it to the
well established urinary biomarker NGAL. We searched
for the best timing of L-FABP sampling and analyzed the
impact of normalization to UCr. Second, we used this
data to compare the value of both novel urinary bio￾markers to traditional predictors of allograft recovery -
diuresis and UCr concentration. The product of both
quantities - UCr excretion rate - was also analyzed in
this regard.
Methods
We conducted a single centre prospective observational
cohort study of adult patients receiving a deceased￾donor kidney transplant in the period from November
1st, 2010 till May 28th, 2012. We obtained informed
consent from all participants and the research was ap￾proved by the national medical ethics committee. All
transplantations were conducted through Eurotransplant
program. The recipients of DDKT were excluded from
the study in case of early surgical complication known at
time of biomarker sampling (renal vein and arterial
trombosis) and transplantectomy. Induction immuno￾suppression routinely consisted of basiliximab, cyclo￾sporine, mycophenolate mofetil and corticosteroids [13].
Patient and donor data were obtained from interview,
patient medical documentation and Eurotransplant donor
medical files before the transplant operation. Time of
transplantation was defined at the time of surgical estab￾lishment of blood flow through the allograft in the recipi￾ent. After this time point the urine samples were taken 4,
10, 24 and 48 h later (urine samples 1,2,3 and 4). These
samples were taken from the fresh urine obtained with
bladder catheter in all cases. A minimum of 20 ml of urine
was sampled and immediately transported to laboratory
for centrifugation and storage. In a subset of patients with
residual diuresis voided urine sample before transplant￾ation was obtained (urine sample 0). At the time of collec￾tion of post-transplant samples hourly diuresis was
measured with the routine clinical urine collecting bag
and measurement container to the nearest 5 ml.
Urine was centrifuged 10 minutes at 3000 rpm and super￾natant was stored at -30°C. Urine creatinine (UCr) con￾centration was measured spectrophotometrically with the
use of standard kinetic Jaffe’s reaction (system Dimensionâ
Xpand, Siemens). Serum creatinine (SCr) concentrations
were measured with the kinetically compensated Jaffe’s
method (system Advia 1800, Siemens, Tarrytown, USA).
UCr excretion rate at the sampling time points in mmol/h
was calculated by multiplying UCr concentration of the
sample with the hourly diuresis in the last hour before
the sampling. NGAL concentration was measured only in
the sample 3 (24 h post-transplant). Turbidimetric im￾mune assay (Bioporto Diagnostics) on the system Olym￾pus AU 400 was used. All samples were measured in the
same analytic procedure, intra-assay variability was up to
6%. L-FABP concentration was measured in the samples 0
to 4. Enzyme linked immunoassay was used (HK404
Human L-FABP set, Hycult Biotech). All samples were
measured in the same series with intra-assay variation
of 9.5%.
SCr concentration was routinely measured 3-5 hours
after transplant operation and at each post-operative day
in the first week. When the relative SCr decrement was
more than 70% in the first post-transplant week, the re￾cipients were designated as immediate graft function
(IGF). Relative SCr decrement was calculated as the dif￾ference between first SCr value at 3-5 h on day 0 and
the value on day 7 divided by Scr at 3-5 h on day 0. Re￾cipients who had a relative SCr decrement lower than
70% were designated as slow graft function (SGF) and
recipients with at least one haemodialysis procedure in

the first post-transplant week were designated as delayed
graft function (DGF). For the purpose of statistical ana￾lysis the recipients were divided into two groups: IGF
and others (SGF and DGF combined). All statistical tests
were performed two-tailed with a significance level of
0.05. Results are presented as mean ± SD for normally
distributed parameters, median (range) for non-normally
distributed ones and number of recipients (percent) for
nominal variables.
Differences between both groups were analyzed using
T-test, Mann-Whitney’s U test and chi-squared test as
appropriate. We performed ROC curves to test the dis￾criminating value of markers for the first post-transplant
week allograft function (either IGF or SGF/DGF). ROC
curve is a graphical plot which illustrates the perform￾ance of a binary classifier system as its discrimination
threshold is varied. It is created by plotting sensitivity
(true positive rate) against 1-specificity (false positive
rate) at various threshold settings. Youden’s index (the
point on ROC curve with maximal value of sensitivity
and specificity sum) was used to define the optimal cut￾off point for each marker.
We have made a determination of the sample size
under the assumption of area under the ROC curve of a
putative biomarker of 0.8, with alpha type mistake of
0.05 and beta of 0.1. Under this assumptions the number
of subjects needed to reach statistical significance for
this AUC was 28 in the positive and 28 in the negative
category - 56 total.
Classification tree method with binary algorithm was
used to test the added predictive value of L-FABP or
NGAL when diuresis and creatinine excretion rate were
also used. In the next step testing of each constructed
classification tree was performed with the “leave-one￾out” method. Here, each time a single recipient is ex￾cluded from the classification tree construction and then
the constructed tree is tested for correct prediction of
the excluded recipient. This way, the percentage of cor￾rect predictions can be calculated and compared with
different markers used in the classification tree. For stat￾istical comparison of areas under ROC curves Medcalc
application was used (v.12.3., Medcalc software, USA);
for all other statistical analyses IBM SPSS Statistics soft￾ware was used (IBM, USA).
Results
In the study period 74 DDKT recipients were included.
Three recipients were excluded from the analysis due to
complications in the first days known at time of urine sam￾pling (3 renal vein thromboses). Mean age of 71 remaining
recipients was 50 ± 12 years, 56% were male. Median re￾sidual urine output was 400 ml per day (0-3000 ml), 27
recipients were anuric (100 ml urine daily or less). There
were 31 recipients (44%) with IGF, 20 (28%) with SGF and
20 (28%) with DGF. SGF and DGF patients were combined
in the single SGF/DGF group of 40 patients (56%). Clinical
parameters influencing early graft function are shown in
the Table 1.
We tested urine output, UCr excretion rate, NGAL and
L-FABP as predictive markers of early allograft function in
the first post-transplant week. Urine output at 4 sampling
time points after transplantation is shown in Figure 1. The
difference between IGF and SGF/DGF groups was largest
immediately after operation and decreased later on.
Therefore we used urine output 4 h after transplantation
for analysis of diuresis as predictive marker.
When L-FABP and NGAL were analyzed for discrim￾inative and predictive value of allograft function, results
were consistently improved if normalization of their
urinary concentrations to UCr concentration was used.
L-FABP urinary concentrations with time for both
groups of recipients are shown in Figure 2 (2A for urin￾ary concentrations and 2B for concentrations normalized
to UCr). Significant difference between both groups for
non-normalized L-FABP concentrations was only found
at 48 hours after transplantation: urinary L-FABP was
55.1 (range: 0.6-127) and 69.5 (13.1-125.2) mg/L in IGF
and SGF/DGF groups, respectively (p = 0.018). Area under
ROC curve (ROC AUC) for L-FABP concentration at
48-hour was 0.65 (95% C.I. 0.53-0.77). When normalization
to UCr was made, the ROC AUC was significantly larger,
both for L-FABP and NGAL (p = 0.005 and 0.001, respect￾ively). Urinary NGAL concentrations were 91.8 (3.5-381.8)
and 274.9 (3.5-2390) μg/L in IGF and SGF/DGF groups re￾spectively, p = 0.042, and ROC AUC was 0.69 (0.56-0.8).
ROC AUC for urinary concentrations normalized to UCr,
together with sensitivity, specificity and the median values
for both groups are shown in the Table 2.
UCr excretion rate at 10 hours post-transplant had the
largest area under ROC curve. Since recipients with re￾sidual urine output could excrete significant amount of
creatinine through their native kidneys we divided recip￾ients into two groups according to residual diuresis
(anuric recipients and others). For both groups similar
and consistent differences in UCr excretion rate were
found between IGF and SGF/DGF subgroups (exact re￾sults are shown in Additional file 1). The positive and
negative predictive values for UCr excretion rate com￾pared to other markers are shown in the Table 3.
Added predictive value of L-FABP or NGAL above
that of urine output and UCr excretion rate was ana￾lyzed using the method of classification trees. When
using solely urine output and UCr excretion rate 89% of
outcomes (63 out of 71) could be correctly predicted
(the outcomes being IGF or SGF/DGF). When L-FABP
normalized to UCr at 48 h post-transplant was added
to classification tree, 92% of outcomes were correctly
predicted (65 out of 71). When NGAL was used, 90%

(64 out of 71) outcomes were correctly predicted. (The
constructed classification trees are shown in Additional
file 2). After the first week there were two patients with
early rejections diagnosed. In a post-hoc analysis with
these two patients excluded - a way to obtain a clearer
patient sample with pure ischemia-reperfusion injury,
the results were essentially unchanged (exact results not
shown).
Discussion
In the present study we measured urinary L-FABP, NGAL,
diuresis and UCr to find the best predictive marker for
early allograft function in deceased donor kidney trans￾plantation. Finding a reliable biomarker for early allograft
function has two major implications. First is the clinical
use in cases of poor early allograft function. When differ￾ential diagnostic possibilities of competing pre-renal and
post-renal diagnoses are excluded, patients with DGF
should be biopsied to discriminate between the presence
of acute rejection and acute tubular necrosis. The exact
time point of the kidney biopsy is variable in this scenario.
However, when a reliable biomarker would suggest a good
recovery of kidney function but this would not be the case,
the clinician could pursue an earlier diagnostic evaluation
and treatment intervention. This was also the reason for
dividing patients to the two outcome groups: patients with
immediate graft function and others (SGF and DGF pa￾tients). A second important demand for pursue of optimal
predictive biomarker in the early post-transplant period
comes from the fact that several potential targets in
ischemia-reperfusion mechanisms are already identified
and new treatments for DGF are or will be tested to allevi￾ate ischemia-reperfusion injury [1]. Having a good early
biomarker of the ischemia-reperfusion injury would aid to
identify the patients where an early intervention would be
beneficial.
Our results show that the predictive value of urinary
L-FABP for DGF and SGF is comparable to NGAL. The
optimal time to sample urine for L-FABP was 48 h post
transplant and the area under ROC curve was similar to
that of NGAL. Good positive and negative predictive
value for DGF and SGF were found (83% both). We have
only sampled NGAL at 24 h post-transplant since this
biomarker was extensively evaluated in previous studies
[7,8] and this time point was found to be appropriate.
This is a slight comparative advantage for NGAL since
according to our data, best predictive value for L-FABP
is only obtained 48 h post-transplant so NGAL allows
earlier prediction of allograft function. So far, L-FABP

has been studied in a living-donor kidney transplant co￾hort, where no value for prediction of early rejection
could be found [14]. Przybylowski et al studied L-FABP
in a cohort of heart and kidney allograft recipients and
found that urinary L-FABP correlated with renal allo￾graft function concluding that it could potentially serve
as a marker for impaired kidney function [11]. Our study
is to our knowledge the first report on the comparative
value of L-FABP as a predictor of early allograft function
in DDKT with comparison to a well established urinary
marker NGAL and UCr.
We consistently found improvement in predictive abil￾ity when urinary L-FABP concentrations were normal￾ized to UCr concentration. UCr excretion fluctuates in
the conditions of unstable kidney function and this was
shown to importantly influence urine biomarker to UCr
ratio (12). Specific to the case of early post-transplant
period is the finding that lower UCr concentration in
SGF/DGF patients will tend to inflate biomarker to UCr
ratio and higher UCr in IGF patients will lower this ra￾tio. Therefore, as noted in a theoretical model, a poor
renal allograft function may amplify a tubular injury bio￾marker signal (expressed as biomarker to UCr ratio),
thereby increasing its clinical utility [15]. This was exactly
the case with our results since we found significantly
larger area under the ROC curve when concentrations
of L-FABP (but also NGAL) were normalized to UCr.
Interestingly, this improvement in ROC AUC was not
found in previous study of NGAL [7], although the ROC
AUC for NGAL was actually below that found in one of
the previous studies where normalization to UCr was
done (0.82 [7] vs. 0.9 [6]).
With such an important influence of UCr variation on
the predictive ability of urinary biomarkers it is justified to
inspect the predictive ability of UCr per se. In fact, we
rigorously monitored diuresis and UCr concentration at
predefined time periods after transplantation to examine
the value of these traditional clinical parameters. Regarding

diuresis, there was the largest difference between IGF and
SGF/DGF groups in the first hours after transplantation
and the difference gradually disappeared after 10 h time
point (Figure 1). Our results clearly show that for diuresis
the best predictive and discriminate values are found early
after transplantation. Large urine output 4 h after trans￾plantation had a very high positive predictive value for IGF
(no patient developed SGF/DGF when urine output was
above 328 ml/h 4 h post-transplant, see Table 3). The main
disadvantage of using diuresis was that such a good urine
output early on was present in only a minority of patients
(17 out of 71 patients) and additional predictive markers
are needed for the majority of patients with lower levels of
diuresis.
To evaluate the UCr as predictor of allograft function
we calculated UCr excretion rate, which is a product of
urinary output and UCr concentration and as such may
combine the predictive ability of both parameters. Excel￾lent results were found. UCr excretion rate 10 hours
post-transplant had numerically the largest area under
ROC curve for discrimination between IGF and SGF/
DGF groups (although not significantly different from
L-FABP and NGAL). Our results show that at approxi￾mate cut-off of 0.5 mmol of UCr/h either 10 or 24 h
post-transplant there is a very high positive and negative
predictive value for early allograft function (89% positive
and 91% negative predictive value 10 h post-transplant,
see Table 3). Furthermore, when both traditional param￾eters were combined in the method of classification
trees, little space for further improvement was left since
this combination of markers adequately predicted first
week outcome in 89% of cases. Further addition of L-FABP
or NGAL did not improve the prediction significantly. Ac￾cording to our results, using diuresis and creatinine excre￾tion rate is a cheap but accurate way to predict IGF or
SGF/DGF as early as 10 h post-transplant.
The drawback of our study is a relatively low number
of included patients. The number was however larger
than in some of previous reports [6,16]. On the other
hand the strength of the study is a rigorous protocol
with predefined times for urine sampling after establishment
of allograft reperfusion therefore eliminating the vari￾ability in timing of urine sampling. As this was a single
centre study all patients were subjected to the same
fluid management protocol and diuretic prescription
practice eliminating the potential difference of these
practices on postoperative diuresis.
Conclusions
In conclusion, urinary L-FABP as a single predictive par￾ameter demonstrated equivalent predictive accuracy for
first week renal transplantation outcome to urinary
NGAL. We found significantly improved predictive abil￾ity of both biomarkers when their urinary concentration
was normalized to UCr. The results with L-FABP were
best when sampled 48 h after establishment of allograft
blood flow. Post-transplant diuresis is a valuable pre￾dictor of allograft function, but its ability to discriminate
between IGF and SGF/DGF patients diminishes 10 h
post-transplant. We have found that the predictive value
of creatinine excretion rate (which combines creatinine
urinary concentration and diuresis) was in fact numeric￾ally above all other tested biomarkers and statistically
not inferior to other biomarkers, which is an original find￾ing. We are certain that this results can be of help to clini￾cians, especially nowadays, when financial constraints may
often prevent a wide accession to modern, but more ex￾pensive, urinary biomarkers. Further studies of urinary bio￾markers should rigorously compare novel biomarkers to
UCr excretion rate, due to its potential high predictive
value, simplicity of measurement and low cost.

delayed graft function in the first post-transplant week
Predictive marker PPVe (%) NPVd (%)
a
Urine output < 325 ml/h 74 100
b
UCr excretion rate < 0.56 mmol/h 89 91
c
UCr excretion rate < 0.46 mmol/h 93 78
c
NGAL > 33.1 μg/mmol UCr 91 73
d
L-FABP > 9.5 mg/mmol UCr 83 83
a
4 h post-transplant; b
UCr - urinary creatinine excretion rate 10 h post-transplant; c
24 h post-transplant; d
48 h post-transplant. e
PPV, positive predictive value; d
NPV, negative predictive value. Estimated prevalence of slow and delayed
graft function was 56%.
