Bariatric surgery in obese patients is a highly effective method of preventing or resolving type 2 diabetes 
mellitus (T2DM); however, the remission rate is not the same among different surgical procedures. We 
compared the effects of 20% weight loss induced by laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) or 
Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery on the metabolic response to a mixed meal, insulin sensitivity, and 
β cell function in nondiabetic obese adults. The metabolic response to meal ingestion was markedly differ￾ent after RYGB than after LAGB surgery, manifested by rapid delivery of ingested glucose into the systemic 
circulation, by an increase in the dynamic insulin secretion rate, and by large, early postprandial increases 
in plasma glucose, insulin, and glucagon-like peptide–1 concentrations in the RYGB group. However, the 
improvement in oral glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, and overall β cell function after weight loss were 
not different between surgical groups. Additionally, both surgical procedures resulted in a similar decrease 
in adipose tissue markers of inflammation. We conclude that marked weight loss itself is primarily respon￾sible for the therapeutic effects of RYGB and LAGB on insulin sensitivity, β cell function, and oral glucose 
tolerance in nondiabetic obese adults.
Introduction
Obesity is an important cause of insulin resistance and impaired 
pancreatic β cell function, which leads to the development of type 2 
diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (1). Weight loss in obese people has 
potent beneficial metabolic effects and can improve both multi￾organ insulin sensitivity (2, 3) and β cell function (4, 5). In fact, 
in most patients, marked weight loss induced by bariatric surgery 
results in complete resolution of T2DM, usually defined as discon￾tinuation of all diabetes medications in conjunction with some 
evidence of normal glycemic control (fasting blood glucose con￾centration or glycated hemoglobin) (6). However, the remission 
rate is not the same among surgical procedures. Procedures that 
divert ingested nutrients from passage through the upper gastro￾intestinal tract, such as Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery, 
have much higher remission rates than do procedures that simply 
restrict the stomach, such as laparoscopic adjustable gastric band￾ing (LAGB) surgery (6). This observation has led to the notion 
that anatomical diversion of the upper gastrointestinal tract has 
important therapeutic effects on glucose homeostasis that are 
independent of weight loss itself. However, the interpretation of 
this clinical observation is confounded by differences in weight 
loss among surgical treatment groups (6).
The main purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that 
upper gastrointestinal tract diversion has weight loss–independent 
therapeutic effects on the 2 major factors involved in the pathogen￾esis of T2DM: β cell function and insulin action. We evaluated the 
metabolic response (glucose kinetics and β cell function) to a mixed 
meal, using stable isotopically labeled tracer methods in conjunc￾tion with mathematical modeling, and assessed insulin sensitivity, 
using the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp procedure and stable 
isotopically labeled tracer infusion, in nondiabetic obese subjects 
both before undergoing RYGB or LAGB surgery and after surgery￾induced loss of a targeted 20% of body weight. We also evaluated the 
effects of surgery-induced weight loss on cellular factors purported 
to be involved in regulating metabolic function, specifically adipose 
tissue inflammatory factors (gene expression of macrophage mark￾ers, chemokines, and cytokines) (7) and intramyocellular lipid inter￾mediates (diacylglycerol [DAG] and ceramide content) (8).
Results
Body composition and basal metabolic variables
Subjects in the LAGB and RYGB groups lost 19.3% ± 1.9% and 
20.1% ± 2.3% of their body weight by 22 ± 7 and 16 ± 2 weeks after 
surgery, respectively (Table 1). The delay in achieving the target 
weight loss in the LAGB group was primarily due to a slower rate 
of weight loss in the first 6 weeks after surgery, before the first 
band adjustment was performed. Weight loss caused marked 
changes in body composition, but the effects on fat-free mass 
(FFM), fat mass (FM), intra-abdominal adipose tissue (IAAT) vol￾ume, intrahepatic triglyceride (IHTG) content, and plasma leptin 
concentration were not different between groups (Table 1). Weight 
loss also caused beneficial changes in plasma markers of glucose 
homeostasis (glucose, insulin, C-peptide, and adiponectin concen￾trations) and inflammation (C-reactive protein [CRP]), but these 
outcome variables decreased equally in both groups after surgery￾induced weight loss (Table 1).
Insulin sensitivity
Values for insulin sensitivity, assessed by using the homeostasis 
model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), decreased by 
more than half after weight loss in the LAGB and RYGB groups, but

there was no significant difference between groups (Table 1). Insulin￾mediated stimulation of glucose disposal above basal values nearly 
doubled after weight loss in both the LAGB and RYGB groups, but 
there was no significant difference between groups (Figure 1).
β Cell function
Total insulin secretion rate (ISR) in response to the mixed meal 
decreased after both LAGB and RYGB surgery-induced weight loss, 
and the decrease was similar in both groups (Figure 2A). Dynamic 
ISR increased after RYGB-induced, but not LAGB-induced, weight 
loss (Figure 2B). Static ISR decreased to a similar extent after both 
LAGB (from 41.3 ± 4.6 × 103 to 31.5 ± 5.1 × 103 nmol/l per 360 
min) and RYGB (from 45.1 ± 13.4 × 103 to 29.2 ± 5.0 × 103 nmol/l 
per 360 min) surgery-induced weight loss. Total β cell sensitivity 
(Φtotal) decreased after surgery-induced weight loss to the same 
extent in both groups (Figure 2C). The disposition index (DI) 
nearly doubled after LAGB- and RYGB-induced weight loss, but 
there was no difference between groups (Figure 2D).
Metabolic response to a mixed meal
Plasma hormone concentrations. Postprandial AUCs for plasma insu￾lin and C-peptide concentrations decreased to a similar extent in 
both groups after surgery-induced weight loss (Table 1). However, 
RYGB surgery altered the shape of the concentration curves, mani￾fested by a much higher peak in the early rise of plasma insulin 
and C-peptide after surgery than before (Figure 3). In addition, 
RYGB surgery, but not LAGB surgery, caused a marked increase in 
postprandial plasma active glucagon-like peptide–1 (GLP-1) con￾centration (Figure 3). Neither LAGB nor RYGB surgery affected 
plasma glucagon concentrations (Figure 3).
Glucose kinetics. The AUC for plasma glucose after ingesting the 
mixed meal decreased to a similar extent in both groups after sur￾gery-induced weight loss (Table 1). However, in contrast to LAGB, 
RYGB resulted in a much higher peak in the early rise of plasma glu￾cose concentration, because of a marked increase in the early rate 
of appearance (Ra) of ingested glucose into the systemic circulation 
(Figure 4). Most of the ingested glucose appeared in the circulation 
within 120 minutes of initiating meal consumption; the percentage 
of total meal-derived glucose that appeared in the circulation with￾in 120 minutes of initiating meal ingestion was 75% ± 14% before 
and 73% ± 13% after surgery in the LAGB group, but increased from 
70% ± 19% before to 92% ± 2% after surgery in the RYGB group 
(P = 0.01). Before surgery, meal ingestion caused a prompt and near￾ly complete suppression of endogenous glucose production (EGP), 
which did not return to baseline even 5.5 hours after complet￾ing meal consumption (Figure 4). Therefore, EGP accounted for 
less than 10%, whereas ingested glucose accounted for more than 
90%, of glucose in plasma at the end of meal ingestion (Figure 4). 
The suppression of EGP in response to meal ingestion was not 
different before and after surgery in the LAGB group. In contrast, 
RYGB surgery resulted in a more rapid and almost complete sup￾pression of EGP, which rapidly returned to baseline levels.
Cellular factors involved in metabolic regulation
Subcutaneous adipose tissue inflammation. Weight loss caused a marked 
decrease in adipose tissue gene expression (as assessed by mRNA 
content) of proinflammatory macrophage cell surface markers 
(EMR1 and CD11B), chemokines (CCL2), and proinflammatory 
cytokines (CSF3, IL6, TNFA, and LEP), but increased the expres￾sion of the antiinflammatory cytokine IL10 (Figure 5). However, 
the changes in these pro- and antiinflammatory markers were not 
different between surgical groups.
Skeletal muscle lipid metabolites. Weight loss did not result in a decrease 
in either intramyocellular total DAG or ceramide content (Figure 6).
Discussion
In the present study, we evaluated whether bariatric surgery that 
bypasses the upper gastrointestinal tract has important weight 
loss–independent effects on plasma glucose homeostasis in nondi￾abetic obese subjects after they have experienced considerable sur￾Table 1

gery-induced weight loss. Our data demonstrated that both insu￾lin sensitivity, assessed as insulin-mediated glucose disposal, and 
β cell function, assessed as the DI (β cell response to a mixed meal 
in relationship to insulin sensitivity), improved markedly after 
20% weight loss, but there were no differences between surgical 
groups. However, RYGB surgery altered the metabolic response to 
ingesting a mixed meal, characterized by rapid delivery of ingested 
glucose into the systemic circulation, which was responsible for a 
large early increase in plasma glucose concentration and insulin 
secretion. In contrast, the rate of delivery of ingested glucose into 
the circulation and the shapes of the plasma glucose and insu￾lin response curves to a mixed meal did not change after LAGB￾induced weight loss. These results demonstrated that even though 
upper gastrointestinal tract diversion caused profound changes in 
certain aspects of the metabolic response to a meal, weight loss 
itself was primarily responsible for the long-term therapeutic 
effects of RYGB and LAGB on β cell function, insulin sensitivity, 
and oral glucose tolerance in nondiabetic obese adults.
Insulin-resistant glucose metabolism in skeletal muscle, one 
of the most common metabolic abnormalities associated with 
obesity, is an important risk factor for developing the metabolic 
syndrome, T2DM, and coronary heart disease (9). Data from pre￾vious studies have found that moderate weight loss 
(5%–10%), induced by RYGB surgery or diet therapy 
alone, does not affect insulin-mediated glucose dis￾posal (10–13). Therefore, the results from our study, 
in conjunction with the data obtained from these pre￾vious studies, indicate that marked weight loss (20%) 
is needed to improve skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity 
in extremely obese people. Moreover, the improvement 
in insulin sensitivity was the same in both the RYGB 
and LAGB groups, which demonstrated that RYGB 
did not have weight loss–independent effects on skel￾etal muscle insulin action.
Weight loss resulted in a 25% decrease in total meal￾induced insulin secretion in both LAGB and RYGB 
groups. This decrease was expected, because less insu￾lin is needed to respond to an oral glucose challenge 
when insulin sensitivity has increased. However, the 
decline in insulin secretion was much less than the 
nearly 2-fold increase in insulin sensitivity. Accord￾ingly, β cell function, assessed as total meal-induced 
insulin secretion in relationship to insulin sensitivity 
(i.e., DI), increased approximately 75% in both surgical 
groups. These data suggest the deterioration in β cell 
function that occurs as obese people progress from normal glu￾cose homeostasis to T2DM (14) can be prevented by weight loss 
induced by either LAGB or RYGB surgery.
The pattern of the metabolic response to mixed meal ingestion 
was very different after RYGB than after LAGB surgery-induced 
weight loss. Although total postprandial ISR and plasma glucose 
concentration AUCs were the same after both surgical procedures, 
the dynamic ISR, which represents the insulin response to increas￾ing plasma glucose concentration (predominantly during the first 
60 minutes after initiating meal ingestion and usually accounting 
for up to 10% of total ISR), increased markedly after RYGB sur￾gery, but did not change after LAGB surgery. The increase in the 
dynamic ISR was likely a direct consequence of the rapid rate of 
glucose absorption, presumably due to rapid emptying of the meal 
into the small intestine (15), and subsequent rapid rise in plasma 
glucose concentration, in conjunction with an increase in the insu￾lin response to plasma glucose because of an increase in plasma 
GLP-1 (16, 17). However, the increase in early meal-induced ISR 
after RYGB surgery did not prevent a marked increase in the early 
peak in plasma glucose concentration. The clinical implications 
of this altered metabolic response to a meal are not clear, but it 
does not necessarily demonstrate a beneficial effect, because a high 
peak postprandial glucose concentration is associated with insulin 
resistance and cardiovascular disease (18–21).
The delivery of ingested glucose into the systemic circulation 
was responsible for the increase in postprandial plasma glucose 
concentration, because hepatic glucose production was almost 
completely suppressed by the meal-induced increase in circulat￾ing insulin. This synergy between glucose absorption and EGP is 
critical to prevent excessive postprandial plasma glucose concen￾trations. Subjects who had RYGB surgery displayed a more rapid 
return toward baseline EGP rate than those who had LAGB, there￾by preventing a continued decline in plasma glucose in the former 
group. The increase in EGP in the RYGB group was likely caused 
by a rapid decline in plasma insulin. These results underscore the 
importance of hepatic function in preventing postprandial hypo￾glycemia in patients who have had RYGB surgery.

Our data demonstrated that weight loss, induced by either 
LAGB or RYGB surgery, had the same beneficial effects on several 
factors that have been previously proposed to regulate metabolic 
function in obese people, namely body composition, circulating 
adiponectin, and markers of inflammation in both plasma and 
adipose tissue (22). Surgery-induced weight loss decreased body 
FM, IAAT volume, and IHTG content; increased plasma adiponec￾tin concentration; decreased plasma CRP concentration; and had 
beneficial effects on multiple pathways of adipose tissue inflam￾mation, manifested by decreased gene expression of proinflamma￾tory macrophages (EMR1 and CD11B), chemokines (CCL2), and 
cytokines (CSF3, IL6, TNFA, and LEP) and increased gene expres￾sion of the antiinflammatory cytokine IL10. However, no differ￾ences in any of these outcome measures were detected between sur￾gical groups, which suggests that weight loss itself, rather than the 
type of surgery, is responsible for the beneficial effects. In contrast, 
we found that weight loss did not affect intramyocellular DAG or 
ceramide content, which have previously been shown to impair 
muscle insulin signaling in rodent models (23, 24). Therefore, 
our results suggest these lipid intermediates were not important 
mediators of the improvement in skeletal 
muscle insulin sensitivity observed in our 
subjects. These data underscore the need 
for additional studies to evaluate the 
importance of intramyocelluar DAG and 
ceramide in the pathogenesis of skeletal 
muscle insulin resistance in obese people.
All study subjects were insulin resistant, 
based on a HOMA-IR value greater than 
2.5, but none had T2DM. Studying sub￾jects without T2DM allowed us to avoid 
the confounding effects of differences in 
baseline glycemic control, glucose toxic￾ity, and changes in diabetes medications 
on our metabolic outcome measures. 
Accordingly, it cannot be assumed that 
our results apply to the diabetic popula￾tion, and additional studies are needed 
in participants with T2DM. Nonetheless, 
our study population does not diminish 
the relevance of our findings, because 
most patients who undergo bariatric sur￾gery (∼80%) do not have T2DM (25).
In conclusion, the results from our 
study provide insights into the physi￾ological effects of marked RYGB- and 
LAGB-induced weight loss on the meta￾bolic response to a meal, on β cell function, and on insulin sensi￾tivity in weight loss–matched groups of obese people who do not 
have T2DM. Our data demonstrated potent but similar beneficial 
effects of marked weight loss, induced by either LAGB or RYGB, 
on both β cell function and insulin sensitivity in obese people. In 
contrast, specific aspects of the metabolic response to a mixed 
meal were profoundly different between surgical procedures, 
because of rapid absorption of ingested glucose after RYGB that 
resulted in a marked transient increase in plasma glucose, insulin, 
and GLP-1 concentrations. However, it is not clear that the altera￾tions in hormone secretion after RYGB have important therapeu￾tic effects on glycemic control, because they did not prevent a large 
early increase in plasma glucose concentration or result in a great￾er reduction in postprandial glucose concentration AUC in this 
group. Therefore, our data do not support the notion of clinically 
meaningful weight loss–independent effects of RYGB surgery on 
β cell function and insulin sensitivity in nondiabetic obese sub￾jects after they have experienced considerable weight loss. Addi￾tional studies are needed to determine whether these findings also 
apply to obese people with T2DM.

Methods
Selection and description of participants
20 consecutive, eligible patients who were scheduled to undergo RYGB (n = 10; 
2 men, 8 women; 43 ± 7 years old) or LAGB (n = 10; 1 man, 9 women; 47 ± 14 
years old) procedures at Barnes-Jewish Hospital (St. Louis, Missouri, USA) 
participated in this study, which was approved by the Washington Univer￾sity Institutional Review Board. All participants provided written informed 
consent and completed a comprehensive medical evaluation. Potential par￾ticipants who smoked cigarettes, had previous malabsorptive or restrictive 
intestinal surgery, had a history of inflammatory intestinal disease, had evi￾dence of severe organ dysfunction, had uncontrolled hypertension, or had 
a serum triglyceride concentration of 400 mg/dl or higher were excluded. 
Potential participants who had diabetes were excluded to avoid the con￾founding effects of differences in baseline glycemic control, glucose toxicity, 
and postsurgical changes in diabetes medications on our outcome measures.
Study design and experimental procedures
Each subject completed body composition analyses, a hyperinsulinemic￾euglycemic clamp procedure, and a mixed-meal metabolic study before 
bariatric surgery and after 20% surgery-induced weight loss.
Body composition assessments. Body FM and FFM, IAAT volume, and 
IHTG content were determined using dual-energy X-ray absorptiom￾etry, magnetic resonance imaging, and magnetic resonance spectros￾copy, respectively (26, 27).
Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp procedure. Subjects were admitted to the 
Washington University School of Medicine Clinical Research Unit (CRU) 
and consumed a standard evening meal (12 kcal/kg FFM; 50% of calories as 
carbohydrate, 30% as fat, 20% as protein). The following morning, a cath￾eter was inserted into a forearm vein for infusion, and a second catheter 
was inserted into a radial artery to obtain blood samples. At 6:00 am, a 
primed, continuous infusion of [6,6-2H2]glucose (priming dose, 22 μmol/
kg; infusion rate, 0.22 μmol/kg/min) was started and maintained until the 
end of the study. At 9:30 am, insulin was infused at a rate of 50 mU × m2
body surface area × min–1 for 4 hours. Euglycemia (plasma glucose ∼100 
mg/dl) was maintained by infusion of 20% dextrose enriched to 2.5% with 
[6,6-2H2]glucose. Blood samples were obtained immediately before starting 
the tracer infusion and during the final 30 minutes of the basal period and 
the clamp procedure to determine plasma substrate and insulin concentra￾tions as well as glucose tracer/tracee ratios (TTRs).
Subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue and vastus lateralis muscle tis￾sue samples were obtained by percutaneous biopsy 60 minutes after start￾ing the glucose tracer infusion during basal conditions. Biopsy sites were 
cleaned and draped. After anesthetizing the skin and underlying tissues with 
lidocaine, adipose tissue was aspirated from the periumbilical area using a 
14-gauge needle, and skeletal muscle was obtained using Tilley-Henkel for￾ceps (Sontec Instruments). Tissue samples were immediately rinsed with 
ice-cold saline and frozen in liquid nitrogen before being stored at –80°C.
Mixed meal metabolic study. Subjects were admitted to the CRU and 
consumed a standard evening meal. The following morning, a catheter

was inserted into a forearm vein for infusion, and a second catheter was 
inserted into a radial artery to obtain blood samples. A primed, continu￾ous infusion of [6,6-2H2]glucose (priming dose, 22 μmol/kg; infusion rate, 
0.22 μmol/kg/min) was started and continued until the end of the study. 
After 3.5 hours of tracer infusion, subjects ingested a liquid meal (contain￾ing 46 g glucose mixed with 0.9 g [U-13C]glucose, 9 g fat, and 9 g protein), 
which was provided in 7 equally divided aliquots given every 5 minutes 
over a 30-minute period. Blood samples were obtained immediately before 
starting the glucose tracer infusion, every 10 minutes for 30 minutes just 
before starting the meal ingestion, and then every 15 minutes for the first 
hour and every 20 minutes for the subsequent 5 hours after starting the 
meal, to determine plasma substrate and hormone concentrations as well 
as glucose TTRs.
Surgical procedures
Bariatric surgeries were performed using standard laparoscopic approaches. 
The RYGB procedure involved creating a small (∼30 ml) proximal gastric 
pouch and a stapled gastrojejunostomy. A 100-cm Roux limb was con￾structed by transecting the jejunum 30 cm distal to the ligament of Treitz 
and performing a stapled jejunojejunostomy at this site (28). The standard 
pars flaccid technique was used for LAGB (Lap-Band; Allergan; ref. 29).
Weight management after surgery
Subjects participated in a supervised dietary weight loss 
program to help subjects in both groups consume a simi￾lar energy-deficit diet and achieve a 20% weight loss with￾in 4–6 months after surgery. All subjects were instructed 
to consume a clear liquid diet (400–600 kcal/d) for the 
first 2 days after surgery, a full liquid diet (400–600 
kcal/d) on postoperative day 3, a pureed diet (2–3 oz/
meal providing 700–800 kcal/d) on days 4–7, and a soft 
diet (3–4 oz/meal providing 800–1,000 kcal/d) on days 
8–29, followed by a regular-food diet containing 1,000–
1,200 kcal/d and 1.0 g protein/kg body weight/d. After 
subjects achieved a 20% weight loss, a balanced weight 
maintenance diet was prescribed, and subjects main￾tained a stable body weight (<2% change) for at least 2 weeks before repeat 
studies were performed.
Analyses of blood samples
Plasma glucose concentration was determined using an automated glu￾cose analyzer (YSI 2300 STAT plus; Yellow Spring Instrument Co.). Plasma 
C-peptide, insulin, glucagon, active GLP-1, leptin, adiponectin, and CRP 
concentrations were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assays (Millipore). Plasma glucose TTRs were determined by using gas 
chromatography–mass spectrometry (30).
Analyses of adipose tissue samples
Isolation of mRNA and quantitative PCR. Frozen adipose tissue samples were 
homogenized in RNAzol Bee (Tel-Test Inc.), and RNA was isolated accord￾ing to the manufacturer’s protocol. Gene expression was determined using 
quantitative real-time PCR. cDNA was synthesized by using SuperScript 
VILO (Life Technologies), and cDNA samples were amplified by using 
SybrGreen reagent and the ABI 7500 thermal cycler (Life Technologies). 
The expression of each gene (EMR1, CD11B, CCL2, CSF3, IL6, TNFA, IL10,

Analyses of skeletal muscle lipid metabolites
Intramyocellular DAG and ceramide concentrations were determined using 
mass spectrometry (31). Muscle tissue samples were weighed and lipids were 
extracted as we previously described (32). About 10% of the lipid extract 
was used to evaluate ceramide content. Quantitation of ceramide molecular 
species was performed by using a Thermo triple quadrupole (TSQ) Van￾tage mass spectrometer and electrospray ionization (ESI) (33). Neutral lip￾ids were extracted from the rest of the lipid extract by hexane and the free 
hydroxyl group in DAG was protected with 2,4-diflourophenyl isocyanate 
to quantitate DAG molecular species using an Agilent 1100 LC system con￾nected to an Agilent 6460 TSQ mass spectrometer operated in ESI and posi￾tive ion mode (34). The LC system allows separation of DAG species from 
other neutral lipids and resolution of 1,2-sn-DAG and 1,3-sn-DAG species. 
Total DAG and ceramide contents were calculated by summation of the 
individual 1,2-sn-DAG (C22:0, C23:0, C24:0, C25:0, C26:0, C27:0, C28:0, 
C29:0, C30:1, C30:0, C31:0, C30:0, C31:0, C32:2, C32:1, C32:0, C33:1, C33:0, 
C34:3, C34:2, C34:1, C34:0, C35:1, C35:0, C36:4, C36:3, C36:2, C36:1, C36:0, 
C38:5, C38:4, C38:3, C38:2, C40:5) and 1,3-sn-DAG (C22:0, C24:0, C26:0, 
C28:0, C30:0, C32:1, C32:0, C34:2, C34:1, C34:0, C36:3, C36:2, C36:1, C36:0) 
species and the individual ceramide (C16:0, C18:1, C18:0, C19:0, C20:0, 
C22:0, C23:0, C24:2, C24:1, C24:0, C24:1OH, C24:0OH) species.
Calculations
Insulin sensitivity. HOMA-IR was used to provide an index of whole-body 
insulin resistance (35). Glucose Ra into plasma was calculated by dividing 
the tracer infusion rate by the average plasma glucose TTR during the last 
30 minutes of the basal and insulin infusion periods (36). Glucose dis￾posal rate was equal to endogenous glucose Ra plus the rate of exogenously 
infused dextrose and glucose tracer. Insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was 
used as an index of skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity.
β Cell function. Minimal model analysis was used to calculate Φtotal, an 
overall index of postprandial insulin secretion in response to plasma glu￾cose, using plasma C-peptide as a function of glucose concentration (37). 
The minimal model can also resolve the total ISR into 2 components rep￾resenting the release of insulin from 2 distinct pools of insulin secretory 
granules within the β cell: a dynamic component that represents the rapid 
release of a “readily releasable pool,” which usually accounts for less than 
10% of total insulin secretory granules, and a static component that rep￾resents the slower release of a “reserve pool” of insulin secretory granules 
(38). The DI, which provides an assessment of insulin secretion in relation￾ship to insulin sensitivity (39), was calculated as the product of Φtotal and 
the change in glucose Rd per kg FFM per change in insulin concentration 
during the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp procedure.
Metabolic response to the mixed meal. Plasma glucose, insulin, and C-pep￾tide concentration AUCs for 6 hours after initiating meal consumption 
were calculated using the trapezoid method (40). Total glucose Ra into 
the systemic circulation during the meal was calculated using Steele’s 
equation for non–steady-state conditions (36). Glucose Ra into the sys￾temic circulation from ingested glucose and from EGP were calculated 
as previously described (41).
Statistics
Data were examined for normality according to the Shapiro-Wilks crite￾ria, and non–normally distributed data sets were log-transformed before 
statistical analyses were performed. A 2-way repeated measures analysis of 
variance with Tukey’s post-hoc procedure was used to compare the effects 
of RYGB and LAGB surgery on study outcome measures (except for post￾prandial metabolic outcomes) in the 2 groups. For postprandial metabolic 
outcomes, mixed-model repeated-measures analysis of variance was used 
to evaluate differences in weight loss–induced changes between LAGB and 
RYGB groups. A P value of 0.05 or less was considered statistically signifi￾cant. All data are presented as means ± SD unless otherwise indicated.
Based on the interindividual variability of glucose rate of disappearance 
(Rd) during a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp procedure in a large 
cohort of nondiabetic obese subjects we previously studied (42), we esti￾mated that 10 subjects in each group (RYGB and LAGB) would be needed 
to detect a 40% difference in insulin-stimulated glucose Rd between the 
RYGB and the LAGB group with a β value of 0.20 (i.e., 80% power) and an 
α value of 0.05. This proposed difference between groups is a conservative 
estimate based on the results from the only 2 previous studies comparing 
the effect of gastric restriction versus RYGB procedures on insulin sensi￾tivity using the hyperinsulinemic clamp procedure (43, 44). In both stud￾ies, insulin-stimulated glucose disposal was more than 200% greater after 
RYGB than after restrictive surgical procedures.
