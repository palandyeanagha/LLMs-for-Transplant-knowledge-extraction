Abstract
Objectives Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) is a rare genetic disorder, characterised by elastic fibre degeneration and calcifi￾cations in multiple organ systems. Computed tomography (CT) imaging is a potential method to monitor disease progression in
PXE patients; however, this method has not been validated. The aim of this study was to correlate histological and computed
tomographic findings in PXE patients to investigate the ability of CT scanning to detect these alterations.
Methods Post mortem total body CT scans were obtained from two PXE patients (a 69-year-old male and 77-year-old female).
Autopsy was performed, and 38 tissue samples of the first and 45 tissue samples of the second patient were extensively
investigated histologically. The findings were compared with the CT scans.
Results Degenerated and calcified elastic fibres and calcifications were histologically found in the skin, subcutaneous fat, heart,
arteries and pleura and around the oesophagus. On CT imaging only the intradermal alterations of the skin and the larger vascular
calcifications were detected. The smaller PXE-related abnormalities were not visible on CT.
Conclusions With CT imaging vascular calcifications and skin alterations can be monitored in PXE patients. However,
many of the subtle PXE-related abnormalities found in other organ systems during the autopsy were not visualised by
CT scans. Furthermore, we extended the current knowledge on the disease location of PXE with subcutaneous,
oesophageal and pleural lesions.
Teaching Points
• CT can be used to monitor gross vascular calcifications in PXE patients.
• Many subtle PXE-related abnormalities are not visualised by CT scans.
• PXE-related alterations can also be found in oesophagus, pleura and subcutaneous fat.

Introduction
Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) or Grönblad-Strandberg
syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterised
by ectopic calcifications of connective tissues [1]. The disease
is, in the majority of cases, caused by mutations in the ABCC6
gene [2–4]. These ABCC6 gene mutations result in lower
levels of inorganic pyrophosphate leading to progressive cal￾cification throughout the body [5].
Previous studies have shown that alterations can be found
both histologically and radiologically in the skin, testis and
blood vessels [6–10]. Furthermore, histological alterations
have been described in the eyes and brain [9–11]. Using im￾aging techniques, calcifications have been described juxta-ar￾ticular, in the soft tissues of the extremities and in the breast [6,
8].
The combination of histology and radiology may provide
insight into the extent to which the imaging findings may be
able to identify the PXE alterations in vivo, important knowl￾edge for further diagnostics and research in living patients.
Although some histological and radiological studies have
been performed in PXE patients, a correlation study between
the two is lacking. The aim of this study was to investigate to
what extent histologically determined alterations can be de￾tected with computed tomography (CT) scan in PXE patients.
Methods
Both tissue samples and CT images were obtained from two
autopsy patients (a 69-year-old male and 77-year-old female)
diagnosed with PXE ante mortem. One of the patients donated
her body to science via the Department of Anatomy of the
University Medical Centre Utrecht. From this patient, written
informed consent regarding the use of her body for education￾al and research purposes was obtained during life. For the
other patient, relatives gave consent to the post mortem inves￾tigations. Collection of the material was approved by the local
biobank review committee under protocol number 15–252.
Radiology
Subjects were scanned post mortem on a Philips
Brilliance 256-slice CT scanner (Philips Healthcare,
Best, The Netherlands). Tube voltage was 140 kV and
tube current 200 mAs. Non-contrast-enhanced CT scans
with 0.9-mm slice thickness were acquired. The CT
scans were evaluated by one radiologist (PdJ) with 14
years of experience in reading CT scans. The radiologist
was blinded to the autopsy results, but aware of the
locations that were histologically examined.
Histology
Tissue samples from the skin, heart, arteries, digestive system,
respiratory system, genitourinary system, haematopoietic sys￾tem, endocrine system and central nervous system (online
supplemental Table 1) were obtained the during autopsy and
fixed in 4% formaldehyde. The macroscopically calcified sam￾ples were subsequently decalcified using diaminoethylene
tetraacetic acid solution (EDTA). Decalcification was necessary
to maintain the morphology of the tissue specimens. Since his￾tological evaluation of calcification is based on visualisation of
the previously altered matrix by the calcification process, and
not the calcium ions themselves, decalcification does not influ￾ence analysis [12]. Four-micrometre slides were cut and stained
with haematoxylin and eosin and, in anatomic locations where
elastic fibres were expected, additional elastin van Gieson stain
was used. In non-decalcified tissue with altered elastic fibres, a
von Kossa stain was used to detect calcifications.
Results
Skin
Classical PXE skin alterations were found at the axillae of
both patients, a localisation typically known for skin changes
in PXE. Microscopically dense clumps of degenerated and
calcified elastic fibres were found in the mid and lower der￾mis. On CT, these alterations were seen as thickened skin
without obvious calcifications. Microscopy of the macroscop￾ically normal skin of the abdomen and extremities showed
similar changes that were located in the connective tissue sep￾ta between the subcutaneous fatty layer (Fig. 1). On CT, how￾ever, no abnormalities were seen at these locations (Table 1).
Cardiovascular system
The hearts of both patients showed localised degenerated
and calcified elastic fibres in the area underneath the en￾docardial layer, mainly present in both atria. Furthermore,
some similar elastic fibres were present in the interstitial
fibrous tissue between the cardiomyocytes (Fig. 2). On
CT no calcifications were seen in the endo- or myocardial
tissue. Calcification of the valves was not present in these
patients (Table 1).
The vascular system showed the presence of both athero￾sclerotic intimal lesions with calcifications and calcifications
in the medial layer and/or around the internal and external
elastic lamina of the arterial system. In the lower extremities,
large amounts of medial/elastic lamina calcification were pres￾ent, accompanied by intimal lesions of variable severity. Also
the gastroepiploic artery showed extensive calcification of the
medial layer and around the elastic lamina. On CT, these
494 Insights Imaging (2018) 9:493–498

medial calcifications were detected as more or less circumfer￾ential and present over a longer track of the vascular wall. The
other large and middle-sized arteries showed variable amounts
of calcified elastic fibres in the media (in elastic arteries) and/
or the internal and external elastic lamina (Fig. 3). These small
scattered calcified fibres were not detected on CT.
Furthermore, in some of the small arteries in the organs (heart,
lung, kidney, stomach, pancreas, thyroid), more or less cir￾cumferential calcification of the internal elastic lamina was
present. These very small vessels were not detected on CT.
Besides medial/elastic lamina calcification, also many calcifi￾cations were present in the atherosclerotic lesions found in
both patients. These calcifications were much more clumped
together and therefore, if large enough, detectable on CT
(Table 1).
Central nervous system
A lacunar infarction was found in both patients (one in
the left frontal lobe and one in the area of the basal
nuclei). Furthermore, in one patient the central white
matter showed dispersion of the fibrillary matrix with
clear demyelination. The subcortical white matter was
unremarkable (Fig. 4). The cerebral microvasculature
showed sclerosis of the vascular wall, with vascular cal￾cifications in the area of the globus pallidus. In one of
the patients, some calcifications were present in the hip￾pocampal region. On the CT, there were nonspecific ab￾normalities in the white matter area. The small vascular
calcifications in the area of the globus pallidus, present
in both patients, were not seen on CT. Also the vascular
calcifications in the hippocampal area of one of the pa￾tients were not seen (Table 1).
Other findings
In one of the patients, a kidney stone in the right kidney
was found, an observation also made via CT. The same
patient also showed a calcified right adrenal gland, micro￾scopically fitting with a myelolipoma with, or combined
with, extreme calcifications and bony transformation.
Furthermore, small gallstones were present in the gallblad￾der of this patient. These were seen on CT. In the other
patient, some degenerated and calcified fibres were found
histologically in the pleura and around the oesophagus.
The CT showed a thickened pleura. However, since this
patient also suffered from a malignancy in the lung, the
cause of this thickening was probably localisation of the
lung carcinoma and not alterations caused by PXE. No
abnormalities were seen around the oesophagus on CT
(Table 1).
Discussion
PXE is a systemic disease characterised by elastic fibre degen￾eration and calcification in multiple organ systems. The pres￾ent study combines radiological and histological findings in
two PXE patients to investigate which alterations can and
which cannot be seen using CT. The study has two important
results. First, most of the abnormalities seen on histological
slides were not seen on the CT, except for the intradermal skin
alterations and part of the vascular calcifications. Second, this

lesions were found, consisting of
clumps of degenerated elastic
fibres in the mid and lower dermis

calcifications of these elastic
fibres (B). On the CT scan,
thickened skin (<) was seen (C).
D–F: Other localisations of the
skin, macroscopically unremark￾able, showed degenerated elastic
fibres in the septa of the subcuta￾neous fatty layer. The marked ar￾ea in D is shown in E (H&E stain)
and F (von Kossa stain)

study adds to the existing knowledge regarding the abnormal￾ities that can be seen in PXE patients. Degenerated and calci￾fied elastic fibres were not only found in the skin, arteries,
heart and pleura, where they have been described before, but
also in the fibrous bands in between the subcutaneous fat
tissue and around the oesophagus.
Skin
Besides the histological skin alterations typical for PXE,
we also found histological alterations in macroscopically
unaltered skin, most abundantly located in the subcutane￾ous fat. The presence of some abnormal elastic fibres in
non-lesional skin has been described before [13]. However,
the presence of subcutaneous lesions at these locations has
not been described before. A possible explanation could be
that most knowledge about histological skin alterations is
obtained by studies in skin biopsies, with only small
amounts of subcutaneous fat.
Cardiovascular system
In the heart degenerated and calcified elastic fibres were pres￾ent subendocardially and in the interstitium between the
cardiomyocytes. The presence of these altered elastic fibres
in the cardiac tissue has been described before and has been
suggested as a cause of restrictive cardiomyopathy and con￾gestive heart failure [9, 14].
The vascular system showed the presence of both athero￾sclerotic intimal lesions with calcifications and calcifications
present in the medial layer and/or around the internal and
external elastic lamina of the vascular wall. In case of exten￾sive calcification of the medial layer or elastic lamina, on CT
scans a more or less circumferential pattern over a longer
segment of the vessel was seen. This pattern is comparable
to the pattern of medial calcification seen on X-rays described
in the scarce literature [15]. Our findings of vascular calcifi￾cations and the combination of both atherosclerosis and me￾dial calcification are consistent with previous findings [16].

Central nervous system
In both patients, a lacunar infarction was found. The combi￾nation of PXE and lacunar infarctions of the brain has been
described before as a complication of small vessel disease
[17]. Also the white matter lesions, as seen in one of our
patients, have been described before in association with PXE
[11, 17, 18]. The combination of lacunar infarctions and white
matter lesions have been described in association with cogni￾tive deterioration, although reports also mention extensive
white matter lesions in a patient with normal baseline cogni￾tive status [17]. On CT scans nonspecific abnormalities could
be found in the white matter area. For diagnostic purposes and
further research, MRI probably is a better imaging technique.
Other findings
A kidney stone was found in one of the patients. A possible
relation between PXE and nephrolithiasis has been suggested
before [19]. However, in most of the patients described
phosphocalcic abnormalities were present, which was not
the case in our patient. Since nephrolithiasis is not a rare con￾dition, it is not unlikely that this is a coincidental finding. In
the same patient, also gallstones and a calcified adrenal gland
were found. It is unknown to which extent this can be related
to PXE. Furthermore, in the other patient some calcified fibres
were found in the pleura and around the oesophagus. To our
knowledge, degenerated and calcified elastic fibres have not
been described in these locations before.
An important limitation of this study is the limited num￾ber of bodies studied, which can be explained by the low
incidence of the disease and low autopsy rate in
The Netherlands. Due to this small number of patients, it
is possible that by chance we selected two patients in
which many abnormalities were not seen on CT scans,
while in larger series of patients this would not have been
the case. Therefore, our findings need confirmation in a

C and D. The same internal elastic lamina and medial calcifications were
visible in the gastroepiploic artery, located along the greater curvature of
the stomach, in both the histology (calcifications are marked in C) and CT
scan (<). E and F: In most of the other large- and middle-sized arteries,
variable amounts of calcified elastic fibres were seen in the media (in
elastic arteries) and/or around the internal and external elastic lamina
(marked). These small calcifications could not be detected on CT scans,
on which also many atherosclerotic intimal calcifications were visible
(i = intima, m = media, a = adventitia; dotted lines indicate internal and
external elastic lamina)

larger series of patients. Nevertheless, the findings in our
patients during autopsy are comparable to those described
in the literature. Furthermore, we did not study the eyes of
the patients. However, most of the ocular findings in PXE
(peau d’orange, angioid streaks, chorioretinal atrophies)
can already be diagnosed in living patients using a variety
of diagnostic techniques [20]. It is doubtful whether CT,
with a relatively low resolution for a small organ such as
the eye, can contribute to these diagnoses.
In conclusion, autopsy of two PXE patients revealed
degenerated and calcified elastic fibres and calcifications in
skin, heart and arteries, but also in between the subcutaneous
fat tissue, in the pleura and around the oesophagus, locations
where they have not been described before. Only the intrader￾mal and vascular calcifications were seen on CT. Our results
indicate that CT can be used to study vascular calcifications in
this patient population. However, while doing so, one should
keep in mind that small calcifications are not visible using this
technique.
