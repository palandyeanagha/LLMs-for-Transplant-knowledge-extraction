This study, using mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells derived from ROCK1  /  and ROCK2  /  mice, is designed to dissect
roles for ROCK1 and ROCK2 in regulating actin cytoskeleton reorganization induced by doxorubicin, a chemotherapeutic drug.
ROCK1  /  MEFs exhibited improved actin cytoskeleton stability characterized by attenuated periphery actomyosin ring
formation and preserved central stress fibers, associated with decreased myosin light chain 2 (MLC2) phosphorylation but
preserved cofilin phosphorylation. These effects resulted in a significant reduction in cell shrinkage, detachment, and
predetachment apoptosis. In contrast, ROCK2  /  MEFs showed increased periphery membrane folding and impaired cell
adhesion, associated with reduced phosphorylation of both MLC2 and cofilin. Treatment with inhibitor of myosin (blebbistatin),
inhibitor of actin polymerization (cytochalasin D), and ROCK pan-inhibitor (Y27632) confirmed the contributions of actomyosin
contraction and stress fiber instability to stress-induced actin cytoskeleton reorganization. These results support a novel
concept that ROCK1 is involved in destabilizing actin cytoskeleton through regulating MLC2 phosphorylation and peripheral
actomyosin contraction, whereas ROCK2 is required for stabilizing actin cytoskeleton through regulating cofilin
phosphorylation. Consequently, ROCK1 and ROCK2 can be functional different in regulating stress-induced stress fiber
disassembly and cell detachment.

Rho-kinase (ROCK) is one of the best-characterized effectors
of small GTPase RhoA and belongs to the AGC (protein
kinase A/protein kinase G/protein kinase C) family of serine/
threonine kinases.1–4 As a major downstream effector of
RhoA, ROCK promotes actin–myosin-mediated contractile
force generation by phosphorylating a variety of downstream
target proteins. The major downstream substrates of ROCK
include the myosin binding subunit of myosin light chain
(MLC) phosphatase 1 (MYPT1),5,6 myosin light chain 2
(MLC2),5 LIM kinases,7,8 thereby modulating actin cytoske￾leton organization, stress fiber formation and smooth muscle
cell contraction. ROCK can increase MLC2 phosphorylation
through direct effect on MLC2 or indirectly by inactivating MLC
phosphatase, resulting in stimulation of actomyosin contrac￾tility.5,6 ROCK stabilizes actin filaments through LIM kinases
(LIMK) activation, resulting in cofilin phosphorylation and
thereby inhibiting its actin depolymerization activity.7,8 Both
ROCK/MYPT1/MLC2 and ROCK/LIMK/cofilin pathways are
heavily involved in stress fiber assembly and cell adhesion.
However, the roles of ROCK in the regulation of stress fiber
disassembly and cell detachment are less well understood.
The ROCK family contains two members, ROCK1 and
ROCK2; they share 65% overall identity and 92% identity in
the kinase domain.1–4 Both kinases contain a catalytic
kinase domain at the N-terminus, followed by a central
coiled-coil domain, including a Rho-binding domain and a
C-terminal pleckstrin-homology (PH) domain, with an internal
cysteine-rich domain. Owing to the high degree of sequence
homology, ROCK1 and ROCK2 are believed to share more
than 30 immediate downstream substrates, including
MYPT1, MLC, and LIMK (reviewed in refs 9–16). However,
most of the studies have been performed with non-isoform￾selective pharmacological inhibitors. Two commonly used
ROCK inhibitors, Y2763217 and fasudil,18 target the
ATP-dependent kinase domain, therefore inhibit ROCK1
and ROCK2 with equal potency, and also have non-selective
effects.17,19,20
Regardless of the fact that the two ROCK isoforms are very
similar and are possibly somewhat redundant, a growing body
of evidence supports that they also have unique functions
(reviewed in Surma et al.15 and Shi et al.21). Using mouse
embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells derived from ROCK1 knock￾out mice,22 the current study reveals a novel role for ROCK1
in mediating actin cytoskeleton remodeling in response to
cytotoxic stress induced by doxorubicin, a chemotherapeutic
drug.23,24 Doxorubicin is well known to intercalate within the

DNA, inhibit DNA topoisomerase II, and generate free
radicals.25,26 At the same time, doxorubicin also increases
actin cytoskeleton instability via inhibition of actin polymeriza￾tion.27,28 We observed that ROCK1 deficiency in MEF cells
inhibited actin cytoskeleton reorganization by attenuating
periphery actomyosin ring formation and preserving
central stress fibers, therefore resulting in decreased cell
detachment and predetachment apoptosis. These protective
features are unique to ROCK1 deficiency as ROCK2-deficient
cells exhibited increased periphery membrane folding
and altered cell adhesion. Moreover, ROCK inhibitors
abolished the protective effects of ROCK1 deficiency by
disrupting stress fibers. Although MLC2 phosphorylation was
reduced to a similar extent in ROCK1  /  and ROCK2  / 
MEFs, the profile of cofilin phosphorylation was clearly
different, which likely contributes to their differential effects
on actin cytoskeleton remodeling. Our results reveal that
ROCK1 and ROCK2 are functionally different in regulating
stress-induced actin cytoskeleton reorganization and cell
detachment.
Results
ROCK1 deficiency, but not ROCK2 deficiency or ROCK
inhibitor treatment, improves cell viability in response to
doxorubicin treatment. ROCK1  /  and ROCK2  / 
MEFs in FVB background (Figure 1a) were prepared from
E13.5 homozygous ROCK122 and ROCK2 knockout
embryos (derived from interbreeding of ROCK2 heterozy￾gous mice in FVB background, Supplementary Figure 1),
respectively. At baseline growth condition, both ROCK1  / 
and ROCK2  /  MEFs exhibited similar proliferation rates as
wild-type (WT) MEFs (Supplementary Figure 2). To test the
effects of ROCK isoform deletion responding to doxorubicin
treatment, we first assessed cell viability by methylthiazole
tetrazolium (MTT) assay. WT cells exhibited a dose￾dependent reduction of cell viability (Figure 1b). Importantly,
ROCK1  /  cells exhibited a significant improvement in cell
viability compared with WT cells (Figure 1b). Upon doxor￾ubicin treatment at 3 mM for 16 h, which was the condition
used for most of the following experiments, cell viability in WT
cells was reduced by 50–60%, but only by 10–20% in
ROCK1  /  cells.
A similar experiment was performed with ROCK2  /  MEFs
(Figure 1c). Different from ROCK1  /  cells, ROCK2  /  cells
exhibited a trend of reduction of cell viability compared with WT
cells after doxorubicin treatment, but the difference was not
statistically significant. Moreover, cotreating WT cells with
Y27632 significantly reduced cell viability compared with
doxorubicin treatment alone, indicating that inhibition of both
ROCK1 and ROCK2 enhances doxorubicin-induced cytotoxi￾city (Figure 1d). In the absence of doxorubicin, Y27632
(Ki¼ 0.14 mM for ROCK) had no significant effect on cell
viability at 5–10 mM (Figure 1d). Similar results were observed
with H1152 at 0.5 and 1 mM, another chemical ROCK inhibitor
(Ki¼ 1.6 nM for ROCK).

ROCK1 deficiency inhibits cell detachment in response
to doxorubicin treatment. To determine the cellular
mechanisms underlying the improved cell viability by ROCK1
deletion, we first noticed a significant increase in cell
detachment of WT cells upon doxorubicin treatment, but it
was delayed in ROCK1  /  cells (Figure 2). Bright field
photography and cell counting showed a time-dependent
increase in cell detachment upon doxorubicin treatment of
the WT cells, while a significant reduction was observed in
ROCK1  /  cells (Figures 2a–c). In addition, ROCK1
deficiency also reduced cell detachment at all tested
dosages of doxorubicin (Figures 2d and e). The inhibiting
level of cell detachment (e.g., the ratio of floating cells was
50–60% in WT cells versus 10–20% in ROCK1  /  cells
after 3 mM doxorubicin treatment for 16 h) correlated with the
improved cell viability observed in ROCK1  /  cells
(Figure 1b), supporting that reduced cell detachment
crucially contributes to the improved cell viability of
ROCK1-deficient cells from doxorubicin treatment.
ROCK1 deficiency reduces formation of cortical
contractile rings, preserves central stress fibers, and
reduces cell shape changes. To dissect molecular
mechanisms underlying the inhibitory effects of ROCK1
deletion on doxorubicin-induced detachment, we examined
actin cytoskeleton remodeling. The alteration of the actin
cytoskeleton is mainly driven by actin polymerization/
depolymerization activities and the force exerted by
myosin on actin filaments (‘actomyosin contraction’). The
stress fibers containing filamentous actin (F-actin) and
phosphorylated MLC2 can be broadly divided into two
morphological types: thick and dense stress fibers, which

are located in the peripheral portion of the cell (‘cortical
actin’), and stress fibers, which are located in the central
portion of the cell (‘central stress fibers’). It has been
shown that cells committed to detachment often exhibit
disruption of central stress fibers and form a contractile
ring at the cell periphery.29 Phalloidin and phosphorylated
MLC2 staining revealed that doxorubicin significantly
increased the number of cells containing a cortical contractile
ring and decreased the number of cells containing
central stress fibers in WT cells (Figures 3a and b). In
contrast, ROCK1  /  cells exhibited minimal cell shape
alteration, a significantly less number of cells showing a
cortical contractile ring and an increased number of cells with
preserved central stress fibers compared with WT cells
(Figures 3a and b).
ROCK1 deficiency preferentially reduces MLC2
phosphorylation while preserving cofilin phosphoryla￾tion. Phosphorylation of MLC2 has been shown to have
essential roles in promoting actin disassembly and cell
detachment in non-muscle cells.30,31 Excessive myosin
activity may destabilize central stress fibers.31,32 We
observed that doxorubicin treatment induced an increase in
MLC2 phosphorylation, which could be detected within
30 min in WT MEFs (Figure 3c). In contrast, treatment had
no significant effect on MLC2 phosphorylation in ROCK1  / 
cells, which was reflected in a significantly lower level of
phosphorylated MLC2 compared with WT cells (about 50%
reduction, Figure 3c). These results indicate that ROCK1
deletion inhibits the increased actomyosin contraction
induced by doxorubicin.

We also examined the phosphorylation status of cofilin,
which reduces its actin depolymerization activity.7,8 We
noticed that doxorubicin treatment increased cofilin phosphor￾ylation in WT cells, which was detectable within 30 min
(Figure 3d). ROCK1  /  cells exhibited higher or similar levels
of cofilin phosphorylation compared with WT cells at baseline
or under doxorubicin treatment, respectively (Figure 3d).
These results suggest that ROCK2 activation in ROCK1-
deficient cells maintains the phosphorylation of cofilin, which
was confirmed by the ROCK inhibitor study described below.
Together, these results imply that doxorubicin treatment on
one hand can induce MLC2 phosphorylation, which is
dependent on ROCK1 to promote actomyosin contraction
and cell detachment, and on the other hand, it can increase
cofilin phosphorylation which is not dependent on ROCK1 (but
likely on ROCK2) to maintain actin cytoskeleton stability and
cell adhesion. The increased actomyosin contraction seems
to have a predominant role leading to cell detachment.
ROCK2 deficiency reduces both MLC2 and cofilin
phosphorylation, but does not prevent cell detachment
induced by doxorubicin. Phalloidin stained ROCK2  / 
cells exhibited significant reduction in the number of cells
exhibiting a cortical contractile ring compared with WT cells
(Figures 4a and b), a characteristic shared with ROCK1  / 
cells. However, instead of increasing cortical ring formation,
doxorubicin treatment increased periphery membrane
folding in ROCK2  /  cells (Figures 4a and b), leading to
an altered cell adhesion in ROCK2  /  cells. This morpho￾logical feature was not observed in ROCK1  /  cells at
baseline or after doxorubicin treatment. Consistent with the
increased periphery membrane folding, ROCK2 deletion
does not prevent cell detachment induced by doxorubicin
as ROCK2  /  cells exhibited a trend of an increased ratio of
floating cells compared with that in WT cells (Figure 4c).
Moreover, both MLC2 and cofilin phosphorylation were
reduced by 20 or 50% in ROCK2  /  cells at baseline or

after doxorubicin treatment, respectively (Figures 4d and e),
indicating that ROCK2 deletion has a negative impact on
actin cytoskeleton stability via inhibiting both MLC2 and
cofilin phosphorylation.
Inhibition of ROCKs by inhibitors promotes cell detach￾ment induced by doxorubicin. The inhibition of ROCKs
by Y27632 resulted in the disruption of actin stress fibers in
WT and ROCK1  /  cells (Figure 5a), consistent with the
reported actions of ROCK pan-inhibitors.17 This disruptive
effect on stress fibers significantly increased doxorubicin￾induced cell detachment in WT and ROCK1  /  cells
(Figures 5b and c). As expected, Y27632 treatment
significantly reduced the phosphorylation of MLC
(20–50% reduction, Figure 5d) and cofilin (about 60–80%
reduction, Figure 5e) at both baseline and doxorubicin
treatment conditions in WT cells. Moreover, Y27632 treat￾ment suppressed cofilin phosphorylation in ROCK1  /  cells
to the same extent as in WT cells (Figure 6b). While
MLC phosphorylation was reduced to a similar extent in
ROCK1  /  , ROCK2  /  , or Y27632-treated MEFs, the
profile of cofilin phosphorylation was clearly different in
these cells.
Small interfering ribonucleic acids (siRNA) specifically
targeting ROCK1 or ROCK2 was also used to evaluate
their contribution to the regulation of cytoskeleton stability.
Endogenous ROCK1 or ROCK2 expression was reduced by
80–90% after transfection of their respective siRNA
(Supplementary Figure 3A). ROCK1 siRNA-transfected cells,
similar to ROCK1  /  cells, exhibited reduced cortical ring
formation and preserved central stress fibers compared with
the scrambled siRNA-transfected cells after doxorubicin
treatment (Supplementary Figure 3B). ROCK2 siRNA-trans￾fected cells showed increased periphery membrane folding,
which was more prominent than that observed in ROCK2  / 
cells at baseline condition. Double siRNA transfection
resulted in the disruption of central stress fibers as observed
in Y27632-treated cells.
Caspase-independent mechanism is involved in
doxorubicin-induced cell detachment. The subsequent
experiments were designed to address the mechanisms

doxorubicin,23,24 doxorubicin treatment elicited a dose￾dependent increase of cleaved caspase-3, -8, and -9
(indicators of an increase in apoptosis) and cleaved ROCK1
in WT cells (Figure 6a). Interestingly the level of caspase
activation was significantly reduced in ROCK1  /  cells
(Figure 6a). Consistent with the reduced caspase activation,
annexin V positivity was decreased in ROCK1  /  cells
(Figure 7d, Supplementary Figure 4A). In addition, ROCK
inhibitor treatment augmented caspase activation in WT and
ROCK1  /  cells (Figure 6b).These results support a
correlation between caspase activation and cell detachment.
However, the cotreatment with 10 and 20 mM z-VAD-fmk, a
pan-caspase inhibitor, had no inhibitory effect on cell
detachment in WT and ROCK1  /  cells (Figures 6d
and e), even though the caspase activation was
obviously lowered (Figure 6c), signifying that doxorubicin￾induced cell detachment occurs independently of caspase
activation.
ROCK1 deficiency does not inhibit apoptosis in
detached cells. Cell detachment from extracellular matrix
is also a potent apoptotic inducer.35 Agreeing with this
concept, we observed that the expression levels of cleaved
caspase-3, -8, and -9 in WT cells were at least 20-fold higher
in the floating cells compared with the attached cells after
16 h treatment (Figure 7a). Annexin V staining also demon￾strated marked differences between floating and attached
cells (Figure 7d). In contrast to the attached cells, the levels
of cleaved caspase-3, -8, and -9 in the floating cells were
independent of the dosages and durations of doxorubicin
treatment (Figures 7b and c), indicating that after detach￾ment, apoptosis occurs independently of doxorubicin. In
addition, ROCK1 deficiency did not reduce the levels of
cleaved caspase-3, -8, and -9 and annexin V positivity in
floating cells (Figures 7c and d, Supplementary Figure 4B)
showing that ROCK1 deficiency has no significant inhibitory
effect on apoptosis occurring after detachment.

Inhibition of actomyosin contraction and disruption of
stress fiber formation produce opposite effects on
doxorubicin-induced detachment and apoptosis.
We subsequently validated the contribution of increased
actomyosin contraction and stress fiber instability to doxor￾ubicin-induced cell detachment and apoptosis using
pharmacologic inhibitors, blebbistatin, and cytochalasin
D. Blebbistatin is a direct inhibitor of myosin II ATPase
activity,36 and cytochalasin D inhibits actin polymerization.37
Blebbistatin treatment (1 or 2 mM) partially mimics the
inhibitory effects of ROCK1 deletion on doxorubicin-induced
cell detachment and apoptosis (Figure 8). Blebbistatin
decreased the number of cells with a cortical contractile ring
(Figures 8a and b), reduced cell detachment (the ratio of
floating cells was about 40% for cotreatment versus 60% for
doxorubicin alone) (Figures 8c and d), improved cell viability
(Figure 8e), and attenuated caspase activation (Figure 8f) of
the WT cells compared with doxorubicin treatment alone. In
addition, blebbistatin had no significant effect on ROCK1  / 
cells. Together, our data support the notion that the beneficial
effects of ROCK1 deletion are partially attributable to the
reduced actomyosin contraction via inhibition of MLC2
phosphorylation.
Treatment with 0.2 mM cytochalasin D disrupted stress
fibers, and increased cell detachment similarly in WT and
ROCK1  /  cells (Supplementary Figure 5). Cotreating with
doxorubicin further exaggerated doxorubicin-induced cell
detachment and caspase activation in attached cells. These

detrimental effects of cytochalasin D on WT and ROCK1-
deficient cells are similar to those produced by ROCK
inhibitors in response to doxorubicin treatment. Together,
these data further support the notion that the beneficial effects
of ROCK1 deletion are in part mediated through preservation
of actin cytoskeleton stability.
Discussion
The present study reveals the distinct roles of ROCK isoforms
in regulating actin cytoskeleton reorganization and cell
detachment induced by doxorubicin. By utilizing a combined
genetic and pharmacological approach, our results support
the concept that ROCK1 is involved in destabilizing actin
cytoskeleton through regulating MLC2 phosphorylation and
peripheral actomyosin contraction, whereas ROCK2 is
required for stabilizing actin cytoskeleton through regulating
cofilin phosphorylation. Their distinct actions on actin cytos￾keleton remodeling contribute to their different effects on cell
detachment.
Previous studies using ROCK inhibitors and/or ROCK
dominant active/negative mutants support that ROCK activity
is required for stress fiber organization and cell adhesion
through promoting both myosin activity and actin polymeriza￾tion.5–8,38 Our studies, with isoform-selective deletions of
ROCK, dissociate ROCK-dependent peripheral (ROCK1 and
ROCK2 dependent) and central stress fiber organization
(mainly ROCK2 dependent). This dissociation is likely due to
separating ROCK-dependent MLC2 phosphorylation (ROCK1
and ROCK2 dependent) from ROCK-dependent cofilin phos￾phorylation (mainly ROCK2 dependent). However, in the
absence of ROCK2, ROCK1 is involved in regulating cofilin
phosphorylation and central stress fiber organization as the
reduction of cofilin phosphorylation and disruption of central
stress fibers were less severe in ROCK2-deficient cells than in
ROCK inhibitor-treated cells. Together, our results reveal a
preferential role of endogenous ROCK2 in regulating cofilin
phosphorylation, and also suggest an alternative role for
ROCK1 when ROCK2 activity is absent. The mechanisms
underlying the differential effects of ROCK1 and ROCK2 on
cofilin phosphorylation remain to be determined. The specificity
could be related with the differences in their coil-coiled domains
(55% sequence identity) and PH domains (66% sequence
identity),1–4 which may contribute to their different activation
profiles by RhoA, different lipid-binding preferences of the PH
domains, and different subcellular localizations.39 Although our
results suggest that cofilin phosphorylation is involved in the
differential effects of ROCK1 and ROCK2 on central stress
fiber disassembly, ROCK has additional substrates that may
also contribute to the distinct actions of ROCK isoforms. Future
studies are needed to dissect the mechanisms underlying the
isoform specificity for cofilin phosphorylation, and possibly for
other ROCK targets.
Our results also reveal that ROCK1 deletion attenuates
caspase activation in attached cells upon doxorubicin treat￾ment. This inhibitory effect is mediated, at least in part, by
reduced actomyosin contraction as supported by the obser￾vations that blebbistatin treatment partially mimics antiapop￾totic effects of ROCK1 deletion. The preservation of central
actin stress fibers also contributes to the reduced caspase
activation, as supported by the fact that the treatment with
cytochalasin D could boost caspase activation. Apoptosis can
be induced by a loss of survival signals due to impairment or
loss of cell–cell or cell–matrix interactions, a process termed
anoikis.35 Actin cytoskeleton reorganization leading to the
formation of cortical rings and the disappearance of central
stress fibers represents an early step of anoikis.29 This
mechanism likely contributes to the doxorubicin-induced
apoptosis as the cytoskeleton features of anoikis were
observed in WT cells. These results suggest that ROCK1
deletion inhibits actin cytoskeleton reorganization induced by
doxorubicin treatment, and consequently preserves cell–
matrix interaction and inhibits caspase activation. It is some￾what unexpected that the treatment with caspase inhibitor did
not prevent cell detachment induced by doxorubicin. Previous
studies suggest that caspase-3-mediated ROCK1 activation
promotes cell detachment through increasing MLC phosphor￾ylation.29,33,34,40 In the current study, we detected an increase
in MLC phosphorylation within 30 min after starting doxor￾ubicin treatment, which is before detectable caspase activa￾tion. Our results suggest that doxorubicin induces cell
detachment through ROCK1-dependent but not caspase￾dependent activation of myosin.
Our findings with ROCK1-deficient MEFs share some
similarity with pro-survival effects of ROCK inhibitors in
preventing anoikis in some contexts including embryonic
stem cells grown in suspension culture conditions.41–43 In
addition, our data from using ROCK inhibitors share some
similarity with pro-apoptotic effects of ROCK inhibitors in other
cell contexts.44–46 Depending on the cell type and the
apoptotic stimulus, ROCK activity, can act either as a pro￾apoptotic or as a pro-survival regulator. The pro-apoptotic
effects of ROCK inhibitors were mainly observed in the
adhesion-dependent and differentiated cells. The current
study demonstrates that when placed MEF cells under the
same stress conditions ROCK1 deletion can exert pro￾survival effects, whereas ROCK inhibitors produce pro￾apoptotic effects. It is worth noting that the antiapoptotic
property of ROCK1 deletion observed in this study is
consistent with our previous in vivo observations that ROCK1
deletion inhibits cardiomyocyte apoptosis in cardiac decom￾pensation,47,48 and also in hematopoietic stem cells under
stressed erythropoiesis.49 Together, these studies support
the notion that ROCK1 may represent an attractive therapeu￾tic target to limit tissue damages due to increased apoptosis
under certain pathological conditions.21,47,48 It will be of
interest to determine if the pro-survival characteristics of
ROCK1 deficiency observed in normal cells in response to
doxorubicin could be extended to tumor cells, which would
then promote chemoresistance. Our recent study indicates
that in contrast to normal cells, ROCK1 deletion reduces
survival of oncogene-bearing cells, which exhibit different
cytoskeletal organizations compared with normal cells.50
Future studies are needed to evaluate the roles of ROCK1
and ROCK 2 in cancer cells with aberrant expression and/or
activity of ROCK in response to chemotherapeutic agents.
Recent studies with siRNA-based gene silencing have
shown that ROCK1 and ROCK2 have functional differences in
regulating actin cytoskeleton in a variety of cell types.39,51–58
These studies have mainly addressed stress fiber assembly

and cell adhesion, but did not focus on the effects of isoform
knockdown on cell detachment and death. In agreement with
previous studies characterizing ROCK1  /  or ROCK2  / 
MEFs,52 we observed that the architecture of actin cytoske￾leton in ROCK1  /  or ROCK2  /  MEF cells was largely
similar compared with the WT MEFs at baseline condition,
although we detected a slight reduction in the number of cells
with cortical ring formation in ROCK1  /  MEFs (1.89%
versus 4.62% in WT cells) and a slight increase in the number
of cells with periphery membrane folding in ROCK2  /  MEFs
(10.2% versus 4.32% in WT cells). These subtle differences
between WT cells and ROCK1 or ROCK2-deficient cells were
amplified under stress conditions.
In summary, this study has shown that ROCK1 deletion,
ROCK2 deletion, and pan-ROCK inhibitors produce different
effects on actin stress fiber disassembly, leading to the
different consequences on cell de-adhesion under stressed
condition. A model to summarize all of these findings is
schemed in Figure 8g. During the last decade, ROCK family
has attracted significant interest as a promising target for the
treatment of a wide range of human diseases, including
cardiovascular disorders, neurologic disorders, metabolic
disorders, and cancers.9–16 The current observations should
be valuable for further understanding the beneficial and
detrimental effects of ROCK pan-inhibitors in experimental
and clinical studies, and also for supporting the development
of isoform-selective ROCK1 inhibitors.
Materials and Methods
Cell culture and treatments. MEF cells of global ROCK1-deficient mice in
FVB background22 were prepared from E13.5 embryos using standard
procedures. Briefly, E13.5 embryos were obtained from FVB WT and ROCK1
knockout mice. Genomic DNA was extracted from brain tissues for genotyping.
The embryonic tissues were minced in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
containing trypsin after removing liver and intestine tissues, followed by pipetting
to further dissociate cells from tissues. The MEF cells were collected by
centrifugation, then resuspended and plated in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (DMEM; Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Atlanta Biologicals, Lawrenceville, GA, USA) and
penicillin–streptomycin in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 1C. Cells at
90% confluency were treated with various drugs at indicated times and dosages.
These drugs include pan-ROCK inhibitor Y27632, pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD￾fmk, and blebbistatin from Enzo Life Sciences (Farmingdale, NY, USA);
doxorubicin and cytochalasin D from Sigma (Beverly, MA, USA).
Targeted deletion of a genomic fragment containing exon 2 of ROCK2 gene was
accomplished by homologous recombination in C57BL/6 genetic background
(Supplementary Figure 1). Deletion of exon 2 results in a frame-shift mutation in
ROCK2, removing all residues from the residue 47 to the end of the protein.
Successful targeting and deletion of ROCK2 were confirmed by Southern blotting,
PCR, and western blot (Figure 1a, and Supplementary Figure 1). Heterozygous
ROCK2 mice in C57BL/6 background were backcrossed to FVB background for
more than eight generations. Homozygous deletion of ROCK2 on FVB background
is embryonically lethal. ROCK2-deficient MEF cells were prepared as described
above from E13.5 ROCK2 homozygous knockout embryos derived from
interbreeding of ROCK2 heterozygous mice in FVB background. All animal
experiments were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health
‘Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals’ (NIH Publication No. 85–23,
revised 1996) and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee at Indiana University School of Medicine.
Fluorescence imaging. To detect F-actin, MEF cells were seeded and
attached to gelatin-coated glass coverslips. The cells were fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for
30 min. After blocking with 5% bovine serum albumin, the cells were stained with
rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Life Technologies). For visualization of p-MLC2,
after blocking with 5% goat serum in PBS for 60 min, the cells were incubated with
rabbit polyclonal antibodies to p-MLC2(Ser19) (#3671; Cell Signaling, Beverly,
MA, USA) overnight followed by incubation with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat
anti-rabbit IgG (Life Technologies). The glass coverslips were mounted in
Vectashield mounting media (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA)
containing diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) to counterstain the nuclei. The
fluorescent images were taken with Leica DM5500B microscope (objectives:
HCX PL FUOTAR 20.0  0.50, HCX PL FUOTAR 40  0.75; Bannockburn, IL,
USA) equipped with a DFC300FXR2 camera, and analyzed with the Leica AF6000
software (Bannockburn, IL, USA).
Protein analysis. Following treatment with desired drugs, cells were washed
with cold PBS, solubilized with Tris lysis buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 1% Triton
X-100, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA plus proteinase, and phosphatase inhibitors
(Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA)) or with LAS buffer (50 mM PIPES, pH6.9, 50 mM
NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM EGTA, 5% glyceral, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% Triton
X-100, 0.1% Tween 20, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.001% Antifoam C plus
protease inhibitor cocktail) for 30 min with shaking at 4 1C. Cell lysates were then
cleared by centrifugation at 15 000  g at 4 1C for 15 min, the supernatant was
then resolved on 8% or 10% SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to polyvinylidene
difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The blots were then probed
with primary antibodies to ROCK1 (#sc-5560; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa
Cruz, CA, USA), ROCK2 (#sc-5561), caspase 8 (#sc-7890), MYPT1 (#07-672;
Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), p-MYPT1(Thr696) (#ABS45), caspase-3 (#9662;
Cell Signaling), cleaved caspase-3 (#9661), caspase 9 (#9504), cleaved caspase
9 (#9509), cleaved caspase 8 (#9429), PARP (#9542), cofilin (#3312),
p-cofilin(Ser3) (#3311), MLC2 (#3672), p-MLC2(Ser19) (#3671), LIMK1 (#3842),
and p-LIMK1(Thr508)/LIMK2(Thr505 (#3841)). After washing with buffer, the
membranes were blotted with corresponding secondary antibodies conjugated
with horseradish peroxidase. The membranes were developed with ECL western
blotting or SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Scientific,
Hanover Park, IL, USA), and the blots were visualized by using the Fujifilm LAS￾4000 Imager (Piscataway, NJ, USA). All blots were normalized to GAPDH
(#AM4300; Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) or to actin (#sc-1616; Santa Cruz).
Cell viability and detachment assays. Following treatment with desired
drugs, cell viability was determined by measuring the activity of enzymes that
reduce MTT by the colorimetric assay.59 In a 24-well plate, 1  105 cells/well were
seeded with 1 ml of culture media and exposed to various drugs for indicated time
periods. The media was removed and replaced with 1 ml of DMEM with 0.5 mg of
MTT (without phenol red and FBS) for 4 h. After removing the MTT-containing
DMEM, the remaining formazan blue crystals were dissolved in 1 ml of DMSO.
Absorbance at 540 nm was measured using a microplate reader (iMark microplate
reader; Bio-Rad). The percentage of cell survival was calculated as the A540 value
of treated cells divided by the A540 of control cells in wells of the same culture dish
without treatment multiplied by 100. The samples were prepared in triplicates, and
the absorption value is the average of three measurements. At least three
independent experiments were analyzed.
Following treatment with desired drugs, detached cells in culture medium
(floating cells) were collected at indicated times and counted with a hemacytometer.
The attached cells were harvested by trypsinization and resuspended in culture
medium for counting. Cell viability of floating and attached cells was also determined
by assessing cellular uptake of trypan blue dye (#T8154; Sigma). Briefly, cell
suspension was mixed with equal volume of 0.4% trypan blue solution and counted
for trypan blue positive and negative within 2 min. At least three independent
experiments were analyzed for each condition.
Flow cytometry. Following treatment with desired drugs, the attached or
floating MEF cells were collected. Apoptosis and dead cells were determined by
live staining of the cells with annexin V-FITC (Apoptosis Detection Kit; BD
Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) and 7-amino-actomyocin D (7-AAD),
respectively. Briefly, harvested cells were incubated in binding buffer 30 min at
room temperature, followed by incubation with annexin V-FITC and 7-AAD as
outlined in the manufacturer’s instructions. All samples were analyzed using
Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur and CellQuest software (San Jose, CA, USA). The
samples were prepared in triplicate, and each cell preparation was analyzed twice.
Transfection of siRNA. siRNA was introduced into MEF cells by transient
transfection with X-tremeGENE siRNA Transfection Reagent (Roche). MEF cells

were transfected at 60% confluency. The SMARTpool siRNAs for murine ROCK1
and ROCK2 were purchased from Dharmacon, Thermo Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA,
USA). siRNAs, prediluted in 100 ml of Opti-MEM I (Gibco; Life Technologies), was
combined with X-tremeGENE siRNA transfection reagent diluted in 100 ml of Opti￾MEM I medium as recommended by the manufacturer. The mixture was incubated
for 20 min at room temperature for complex formation and added drop-wisely to
cells. The final siRNA concentration was 80 nM. At 72 h post-transfection, cells
were treated as indicated and followed by western blot analysis or fluorescence
imaging.
Statistical analysis. Data are reported as mean±S.E. Comparisons
between groups were analyzed by Student’s t-test or ANOVA as appropriate,
with Po0.05 considered as significant.
