Abstract
Background: Contradictory evidence has been published on the effects of steroid treatments on the outcomes of
kidney and liver transplantation from brain dead (BD) donors. Our study aimed to evaluate this disparity by
investigating the effect of prednisolone administration on BD rats.
Methods: BD induction was performed in ventilated rats by inflating a Fogarty catheter placed in the epidural space.
Prednisolone (22.5 mg/kg) was administered 30 min prior to BD induction. After four hours of determination of BD:
serum, kidney and liver tissues samples were collected and stored. RT-qPCR, routine biochemistry and
immunohistochemistry were performed.
Results: Prednisolone treatment reduced circulating IL-6 and creatinine plasma levels but not serum AST, ALT or
LDH. Polymorphonuclear influx assessed by histology, and inflammatory gene expression were reduced in the kidney
and liver. However, complement component 3 (C3) expression was decreased in kidney but not in liver. Gene
expression of HSP-70, a cytoprotective protein, was down-regulated in the liver after treatment.
Conclusions: This study shows that prednisolone decreases inflammation and improves renal function, whilst not
reducing liver injury. The persistence of complement activation and the negative effect on protective cellular
mechanisms in the liver may explain the disparity between the effects of prednisolone on the kidney and liver of BD
rats. The difference in the molecular and cellular responses to prednisolone administration may explain the
contradictory evidence of the effects of prednisolone on different organ types from brain dead organ donors.

Background
The shortage of organs for transplantation remains one of
the most important issues facing the transplant commu￾nity today. Increasingly, organs from brain dead extended
criteria donors (ECD) and donors after circulatory arrest
(DCD) are being used to address the organ deficit. The
short and long term outcomes of allografts obtained from
these donors are inferior when compared to living donors

Full list of author information is available at the end of the article
[1,2]. In the case of organs obtained from donors after
brain death (DBD) it has been shown that HLA mis￾matched living donors have better outcomes even when
cold ischemia times are taken into consideration [3]. The
explanation for this lies in the process of brain death (BD)
itself resulting in a non-physiological environment culmi￾nating in significant organ injury prior to organ procure￾ment. The procurement, preservation and reperfusion
phases of transplantation result in significant additional
injury to the allograft rendering it susceptible short and
long term dysfunction [4-6].
BD causes complex disturbances of normal homeo￾static systems resulting in hemodynamic instability [7-10]
hormonal impairment [11-13] and inflammation [14-17].

BD results in significant cerebral ischemia and intracra￾nial hypertension resulting in parasympathetic activity
followed by a severe vasoconstriction. This is due to
an overriding sympathetic response and termed the
“catecholamine storm” which is part of the Cushing reflex;
a physiological response to maintain cerebral perfusion. A
progressive paralysis of the spinal cord occurs, this cause
the loss of vasomotor tone and leads to hemodynamic
instability which characterizes this period [18-20].
Pituitary function is also affected following BD as
adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) secretion is
altered resulting in a transient rise in cortisol levels,
which then diminishes progressing below baseline levels.
In addition other hormones including T4/T3, anti-diuretic
hormone (ADH) and insulin are reduced as a consequence
of BD [21].
BD results in a heightened systemic inflammatory
state as illustrated by the influx of polymorphonuclear
neutrophils (PMNs) into kidney and liver tissues [15].
Systemic production of circulating cytokines includ￾ing interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-10 (IL-10), Tumor
Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α), Transforming Grown
Factor-beta (TGF-β) and Monocyte chemotactic protein
1 (MCP-1) are thought to orchestrate this response. The
trigger for this inflammatory process is not well under￾stood, however recent evidence suggests there could be
a role for cerebral cytokines that cross the blood-brain
barrier, in addition to complement activation [22,23] and
intestinal bacterial translocation [24,25].
A number of important considerations have been
described for the ICU management of BD organ donors.
There is general consensus about the importance of main￾taining hemodynamic stability, but hormonal or anti￾inflammatory treatments remains controversial despite
promising experimental evidence [21]. The adminis￾tration of glucocorticoids to donors has been used as
hormonal replacement therapy with a varied degree of
success [26-31].
In BD glucocorticoid administration could have sev￾eral beneficial effects including anti-inflammatory
properties and the ability to augment chrommaffin
cells production of endogenous epinephrine [32]. The
anti-inflammatory effects of steroids result from the
pleiotropic interaction with the glucocorticoid receptor.
The cortisol-glucocorticoid receptor complex can act
through genomic and non-genomic downstream sig￾nalling pathways within the cell. This involves the
dissociation of heat-shock proteins and the interaction
with membrane-associated receptors, second messengers
and activation of transcription factors such as Nuclear
factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells
(NF-κB) [33].
We hypothesize that prednisolone pre-treatment of BD
rats could reduce the inflammatory response and improve
the quality of kidney and liver allografts. The aim of
this study is to assess the potential benefit of the pred￾nisolone pre-treatment in the liver and kidney of BD
rats.
Methods
Animals
Male adult Fisher F344 rats (250 - 300 g) were used
in all experiments. All animals received care in com￾pliance with the guidelines of the local animal ethics
committee according to Experiments on Animals Act
(1996) issued by the Ministry of Public Health, Welfare
and Sports of the Netherlands. Brain death (BD) was
induced as follows: animals were anesthetized using
isoflurane with O2. A cannula was inserted in the
femoral artery and vein for continuous mean arterial pres￾sure (MAP) monitoring and fluid administration. Ani￾mals were intubated via a tracheostomy and ventilated
throughout the experiment. A no. 4 Fogarty catheter
(Edwards Lifesciences Co, Irvine, CA) was placed in the
epidural space through a frontolateral burr hole, and
slowly inflated (0.16 ml/min) with saline using a syringe
pump (Terufusion, Termo Co, Tokyo, Japan). Inflation
of the balloon was terminated once the MAP began
to improve after a characteristic period of hypotension,
reflecting the autonomic storm. BD was confirmed by
the absence of corneal and pupillary reflexes and a pos￾itive apnea test. Following confirmation of BD, anes￾thesia was terminated but ventilation continued. MAPs
were maintained above 80mmHg using Hydroxyethyl
starch (HAES) 10% (Fresenius Kabi AG, Bad Homburg,
Germany) with a maximum rate of 1 ml/hr. If HAES
was insufficient to maintain the MAP, noradrenaline (NA)
0.01 mg/ml was administered. A homeothermic blan￾ket control system was used throughout the BD main￾tenance period. Four hours after determination of BD,
rats were heparinized with 500 IU heparin. A laparo￾tomy was subsequently performed and blood collected
from the aorta. Organs were flushed with 0.9% saline and
snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and collected plasma stored
at −80°C.
Rats were randomly assigned to each group. The ani￾mal number was calculated using the method of Russ
Lenth [34], with a meaningful difference of 50%, a vari￾ability (sigma) of 0.3 and a power of 0.9. Sham-operated
rats served as controls and were ventilated for half an
hour under anesthesia before termination. This was in
accordance with the requirement of our local Animal
Welfare Committee guidance for the use of sham controls
in experiments. Prednisolone or saline was administered
intravenously 30 minutes before the start of BD induc￾tion. Prednisolone dosage was chosen based on previous
experiments and to give the best hemodynamic stability
(22.5 mg/kg).

The following experimental groups were established:
• Sham-operated animals receiving saline (n = 8).
• Sham-operated animals receiving Prednisolone
(n = 8).
• BD animals receiving saline (n = 8).
• BD animals receiving Prednisolone (n = 8).
Plasma determinations
Plasma creatinine was determined in the biochemistry lab
of the University Medical Center Groningen. The level of
IL-6 in the plasma was determined by a rat enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (IL-6 ELISA) kit (R&D Systems
Europe Ltd. Abingdon, Oxon OX14 3NB, UK), accord￾ing to the manufacturer instructions. All samples were
analyzed in duplicate and read at 450 nm.
RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis
Total RNA was isolated from whole kidneys and
liver sections by using TRIzol (Life Technologies,
Gaithersburg, MD). RNA samples were verified for
absence of genomic DNA contamination by performing
RT-PCR reactions in which the addition of reverse tran￾scriptase was omitted, using Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (GAPDH) primers. For cDNA synthesis,
1 μl T11VN Oligo-dT (0.5 μg/μl) and 1 μg mRNA were
incubated for 10 min at 70°C and cooled directly after
that. cDNA was synthesized by adding a mixture con￾taining 0.5 μl RnaseOUT Ribonuclease inhibitor (Invit￾rogen, Carlsbad, USA), 0.5 μl RNase water (Promega),
4 μl 5 x first strand buffer (Invitrogen), 2 μl DTT (Invitro￾gen), 1 μl dNTPO’s and 1 μl M-MLV reverse transcriptase
(Invitrogen, 200U). The mixture was held at 37°C for 50
min. Next, reverse-transcriptase was inactivated by incu￾bating the mixture for 15 min at 70°C. Samples were
stored at −20°C.
Real-Time PCR
Fragments of several genes were amplified with the primer
sets outlined in Table 1. Pooled cDNA obtained from
brain-dead rats were used as internal references. Gene
expression was normalized with the mean of β-actin
mRNA content. Real-Time PCR was carried out in reac￾tion volumes of 15 μl containing 10 μl of SYBR Green
mastermix (Applied biosystems, Foster City, USA), 0.4 μl
of each primer (50 μM), 4.2 μl of nuclease free water and
10 ng of cDNA. All samples were analyzed in triplicate.
Thermal cycling was performed on the Taqman Applied
Biosystems 7900HT Real Time PCR System with a hot
start for 2 min at 50°C followed by 10 min 95°C. Second
stage was started with 15 s at 95°C (denaturation step)
and 60 s at 60°C (annealing step and DNA synthesis). The
latter stage was repeated 40 times. Stage 3 was included
to detect formation of primer dimers (melting curve) and
begins with 15 s at 95°C followed by 60 s at 60°C and 15 s
at 95°C. Primers were designed with Primer Express soft￾ware (Applied Biosystems) and primer efficiencies were
tested by a standard curve for the primer pair resulting
from the amplification of serially diluted cDNA samples
(10 ng, 5 ng, 2.5 ng, 1.25 ng and 0.625 ng) obtained
from brain-dead rats. PCR efficiency were found to be
1.8 << 2.0. Real-time PCR products were checked for
product specificity on a 1.5% agarose gel. Results were
expressed as 2- CT (CT: Threshold Cycle).
Immunohistochemistry
To detect polymorphonuclear cells in kidney and liver,
immunohistochemistry was performed on 5-μm tis￾sue cryosections. Sections were fixated for 10 min
using acetone. Next, sections were stained with HIS-48
mAb (supernatant, two times diluted) using an indirect
immunoperoxidase technique. Endogenous peroxidase
was blocked using H2O2 0.01% in phosphate-buffered
saline for 30 mins. After thorough washing, sections were
incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit
anti-mouse IgG as a secondary antibody for 30 mins,
followed by goat anti-rabbit IgG as a tertiary antibody
for 30 mins (both from Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). The
reaction was developed using 9-amino-ethylcarbazole as

chromogen and H2O2 as substrate. Sections were coun￾terstained using Mayer hematoxylin solution (Merck,
Darmstadt, Germany). Negative antibody controls were
performed. Localization of immunohistochemical stain￾ing was assessed by light microscopy. For each tissue
section, positive cells per field were counted in 10 micro￾scopic fields of the tissue at 40x magnification. Results
were presented as number of positive cells per glomerulus
in the kidney and number of positive cells per field in the
liver.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using Prism 5.0.
GraphPad. The two-way ANOVA test was performed, fol￾lowed by the Bonferroni post-test. Specific analysis for the
use of HAES and NA between groups was evaluated using
the Mann-Whitney test. The significance level was set at
a p value of < 0.05. Results are presented as mean ± SD
(standard deviation).
Results
Induction of BD showed a consistent and uniform pattern
in alterations of the MAP, with a mean time to declaration
of BD of 31.6 ± 2.73 minutes after commencing balloon
inflation. All 32 animals were kept with a MAP above
80 mmHg during the experiment (Figure 1), after the con￾firmation of BD. In saline treated group, infusion of HAES
10% (2.7 ml ± 1.1) was needed to maintain MAP whereas
in the prednisolone treated group significantly less was
required (1.3 ml ± 1.3 HAES 10%). Administration of NA
was comparable between both groups (saline: 0.11 ± 0.12
mg, prednisolone: 0.05 ± 0.09 mg).
Plasma creatinine levels was significantly different
between sham and BD animals treated with saline solu￾tion. Creatinine plasma levels in BD animals treated with
prednisolone (50.38 ± 6.90) was significantly lower com￾pared to BD rats pre-treated with saline (86.63 ± 18.37)
(Figure 2).
Assessing cellular liver injury, aspartate aminotrans￾ferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH) plasma levels were significantly
increased after BD in comparison to sham animals. No
significant differences were found in AST, ALT or LDH
plasma levels between prednisolone or saline treated BD
rats (Figure 2).
Our results demonstrated a significant decrease in IL-6
levels in BD animals treated with prednisolone compared
to BD animals treated with saline (Figure 2).
Tissue cryosections were stained with HIS-48 mAb to
identify PMNs. The number of positive cells per glomeru￾lus in the kidney was 0.67 ± 0.4 in sham-operated controls
but was elevated to 1.42 ± 0.4 positive cells in the BD
+ saline group. Treatment with prednisolone reduced the
PMN influx to 0.86 ± 0.4 positive cells, reaching statistical
significance compared to the BD saline group (Figure 3).
In the case of the liver, the number of positive cells per
microscopic field was 5.85 ± 2.0 in sham-operated con￾trols but was elevated to 13.41 ± 4.0 positive cells in the
BD + saline group. Treatment with prednisolone signifi￾cantly diminished the PMN influx to 6.97 ± 2.5 positive
cells (Figure 3).

qRT-PCR evaluation of gene expression revealed signif￾icantly upregulated IL-6, Interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β) and
monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) in kidneys
as a consequence of BD compared to sham controls. Rel￾ative expression of IL-6, IL-1β, MCP-1 was significantly
reduced in the prednisolone treated groups in the kidney
samples (Figure 4).
In liver, relative expression of IL-6, IL-1β and MCP￾1 was significantly increased following BD. Prednisolone
treatment significantly reduced IL-6, IL-1β and MCP-1
compared to the BD control group (Figure 4).
TNF-α is a monocyte derived cytotoxin implicated in
mediating apoptosis. In the kidney the relative expres￾sion of TNF-α increased but not to a significant level
following BD. TNF-α was significantly down-regulated
following prednisolone pre-treatment. However, in the
liver the relative expression of TNF-α was significantly
down-regulated following BD and further down-regulated
following prednisolone treatment in the BD group
(Figure 4).
In the kidney C3 expression was increased follow￾ing BD and attenuated following prednisolone treatment.
While in the liver, C3 expression increased following
BD and further increased due to prednisolone treatment
(Figure 5).
To assess the effect on apoptotic pathways we stud￾ied the B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2)/Bcl-2 associated
X protein (BAX) ratio. In the kidney this ratio was
increased following BD but decreased in the liver.
Prednisolone treatment did not significantly mod￾ify this ratio under any experimental condition
(Figure 5).
We studied the effects of the interventions on the
relative expression of two cytoprotective genes. The
relative expression of Heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) in
the kidney was up-regulated following BD and down￾regulated following pre-treatment with prednisolone.
In the liver the HO-1 expression was significantly
up-regulated following prednisolone treatment. The
relative HSP-70 expression in the kidney was not
affected by BD nor prednisolone treatment. How￾ever, the relative expression in the liver was signifi￾cantly down-regulated due to prednisolone pre-treatment
(Figure 5).

Discussion
Disparity exists in the literature with regards to the bene￾ficial effects of prednisolone administration to the donor
on the outcomes of solid organ transplantation. Multi￾ple large randomized control trials (RCT) have evaluated
the effects on steroid administration on the outcomes of
lung, kidney and liver transplant [35-37]. In a RCT, Bonser
et al. evaluated the effects of 1g of methylprednisolone
administration to BD organ donors 7 hours prior to lung
explantation, demonstrating no effect on increasing lung
yields [29]. Others in the realms of kidney transplan￾tation have also failed to detect a significant improve￾ment in the kidney survival at three months when 5g of
methylprednisolone is administered to donors 2-4 hours
prior to explantation. The only clinical trial to suggest a
positive outcome was performed by Kotsch et al. demon￾strating a significant effect on down-regulation of pro￾inflammatory cytokines and reduced incidence of acute
rejection [28]. In contrast, an Austrian study failed to
identify a benefit of 1g of methylprednisolone administra￾tion 6 hours prior to liver recovery [38].
Despite the heterogeneity of outcomes of these tri￾als, steroid administration has, in many countries, been
incorporated into donor management protocols. A review
by Bugge et al. suggests the routine administration of
methylprednisolone in all DBDs [39]. Indeed in the UK
methylprednisolone is being trialed as part of a national
donor optimization care-bundle pathway. Overall there is
a clear need to establish the effects of steroid treatment in
the donor and evaluate the potential differential effects of
treatment on different organ systems.
This study was designed as a proof of concept study
to evaluate the differential effects of prednisolone admin￾istration to brain dead rats. The results of our study
suggest that the effect of steroid therapy in the donor
will have differential effects on different organ sys￾tems. Our study confirms that steroid administration can
improve the hemodynamic stability of the BD rodent.
We hypothesize this effect occurs through facilitating the
retention of sodium and water, and increasing the release
of endogenous epinephrine [40]. Outside of this study,
donor hemodynamic stability has been shown to reduce

pre-procurement injury to allografts and improve short
and long-term outcomes [41,42].
Our study has also shown that steroid administration
does have an anti-inflammatory effect as illustrated by the
reduction of circulating IL-6. IL-6 has been shown to be
significantly up-regulated following BD and is hypothe￾sized to be a key cytokine mediating the inflammatory
cellular response to BD through an NFκB mediated path￾way with the downstream effectors being selectin, MCP-1
and TNF-α [43]. Indeed authors speculate that the link
between cerebral injury and peripheral organ injury lies in
an IL-6 mediated inflammatory response.
In our study prednisolone had different and disparent
effects on kidney and liver allografts. In the kidney we
demonstrated a significant improvement on kidney func￾tion, as assessed by serum creatinine and a reduction in
infiltrating PMNs. This was accompanied by a reduction
in expression of IL-6, MCP1 and IL-1β, we demonstrated
a reduction of TNF-α expression following methylpred￾nisolone administration although this did not reach sig￾nificance. We were able to demonstrate a reduction in
C3 expression, having previously demonstrated the poten￾tial detrimental effects of complement activation in the
BD donor [22,44,45]. We believe these anti-inflammatory
effects, in conjunction with the hemodynamic stability
conferred by prednisolone administration reduces the
injury to the kidney and result in the improved kidney
function.
Our study also demonstrated a reduction in HO-1
expression in the kidney following methylprednisolone
pretreatment of BD rats. As has been shown by Terry et al.
[46] HO-1 is up-regulated by inflammatory cytokines
like IL-1α via protein kinase C and phospholipase A2
in endothelial cells. We hypothesize that prednisolone
is down-regulating HO-1 in the kidney by reducing the
expression of inflammatory cytokines. In contrast to the
kidney, in the liver HO-1 expression was increased fol￾lowing prednisolone pretreatment of the brain dead rat,
even when the expression of inflammatory genes was
decreased. We think that these results could be an indica￾tion of the cellular stress during the brain death period.
In the liver we failed to detect a significant effect of
prednisolone pre-treatment of the BD rat to reduce hepa￾tocyte injury as assessed by AST and ALT, we did however
demonstrate a significant effect on reducing PMN infil￾tration and IL-6, MCP-1 and IL-1β expression. We found
that TNF-α expression was reduced in the liver following
BD in comparison to sham operated animals. This effect
might be related with the surgical stress in both groups
and could be explain by a shorter timeframe between the
surgical procedure and the organ retrieval in sham oper￾ated animals. However, TNF-α expression was further
reduced in the prednisolone pretreated BD rats compare
to the saline pretreated BD animals. TNF-α affects cell
cycle and apoptotic pathways through NFκB and MAP
kinase mediated pathways. Our previous work has sug￾gested TNF-α expression is increased following BD in the
liver and systemically. We have previously been able to
reduce systemic TNF-α release by stimulating the vagus
nerve in a rodent model of brain death [47]. Concurrently
Kotch et al. demonstrated pre-treatment of human donors
with methylprednisolone could reduce TNF-α expression,
supporting our findings.
Our study demonstrated relatively less apoptosis in the
liver compared to the kidney following BD as demon￾strated by the Bcl2/Bax. The comparatively low levels of
TNF-α in the liver following BD may in part explain this.
However, prednisolone failed to have a further effect on
reducing the Bcl2/Bax ratio.
In contrast to the kidney, HSP70 expression in the
liver following BD and prednisolone pre-treatment was
down-regulated. Stoot et al. [48] showed that HSP70 activ￾ity could prevent C3 expression. Interestingly, our study
demonstrated an increase in C3 expression in the liver
following BD and prednisolone pre-treatment. It is likely
that prednisolone is reducing HSP70 expression in the
liver but not in the kidney and thereby increase or facili￾tate C3 deposition in the liver. This may explain the lack
of prednisolone effect on reducing liver injury.
Conclusion
There are a number of differences in the way organs
respond to BD and donor treatment. We have demon￾strated that the administration of prednisolone as a
pre-treatment agent to the BD donor is likely to have
differential effects on the kidney and the liver. The lack
of effect of prednisolone in our experimental set up could
in part, be due to the complement mediated injury. We
acknowledge that we have not evaluated the effect of
prednisolone after BD induction or time-course effect of
prednisolone therapy at earlier or later time-points dur￾ing the BD period. We also have not evaluated the effect
of compounding the injury during the donor period with
organ preservation and reperfusion injury or assessed the
effects of prednisolone. Nevertheless this study demon￾strates the clear need to consider the differential effect of
donor therapies on different organ systems and the need
for further research.
