Abstract
Background: Contusive spinal cord injury is complicated by a delayed loss of oligodendrocytes, resulting in
chronic progressive demyelination. Therefore, transplantation strategies to provide oligodendrocyte lineage cells
and to enhance the extent of myelination appear to be justified for spinal cord repair. The present study
investigated whether transplantation of human neural stem cells (NSCs) genetically modified to express Olig2
transcription factor, an essential regulator of oligodendrocyte development, can improve locomotor recovery and
enhance myelination in a rat contusive spinal cord injury model.
Results: HB1.F3 (F3) immortalized human NSC line was transduced with a retroviral vector encoding Olig2, an
essential regulator of oligodendrocyte development. Overexpression of Olig2 in human NSCs (F3.Olig2) induced
activation of NKX2.2 and directed differentiation of NSCs into oligodendrocyte lineage cells in vitro. Introduction
of Olig2 conferred higher proliferative activity, and a much larger number of F3.Olig2 NSCs were detected by 7
weeks after transplantation into contused spinal cord than that of parental F3 NSCs. F3.Olig2 NSCs exhibited
frequent migration towards the white matter, whereas F3 NSCs were mostly confined to the gray matter or
around the lesion cavities. Most of F3.Olig2 NSCs occupying the spared white matter differentiated into mature
oligodendrocytes. Transplantation of F3.Olig2 NSCs increased the volume of spared white matter and reduced
the cavity volume. Moreover, F3.Olig2 grafts significantly increased the thickness of myelin sheath around the
axons in the spared white matter. Finally, animals with F3.Olig2 grafts showed an improvement in the quality of
hindlimbs locomotion.
Conclusion: Transplantation of NSCs genetically modified to differentiate into an oligodendrocytic lineage may
be an effective strategy to improve functional outcomes following spinal cord trauma. The present study suggests
that molecular factors governing cell fate decisions can be manipulated to enhance reparative potential of the cell￾based therapy.

Background
Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) results in severe and
permanent neurological deficits. However, there is no sin￾gle effective therapeutic option to improve functional out￾comes. Intense research efforts, employing a rodent
model of contusive injury which closely mimics human
SCI, have identified that the pathology in the white matter
incurred by injury is closely associated with the degree of
functional deficits [1-3]. One of the important pathologi￾cal processes in the white matter is a chronic and progres￾sive demyelination of the spared axons [4-7], which
occurs primarily due to delayed and widespread apoptosis
of the oligodendrocytes [8,9]. Absence of myelin sheath
and resultant exposure of potassium channels lead to a
failure of electrical conduction through spared axons,
contributing to chronic functional deficits following SCI
[10]
From these observations, transplantation strategies to pro￾vide cells capable of myelinating axons and enhance
remyelination seem to be well justified for spinal cord
repair. Transplantation of oligodendrocyte progenitor
cells or glial progenitor cells derived from embryonic or
neural stem cells promoted functional recovery in SCI ani￾mal models [11-13]. Furthermore, a large part of behavio￾ral gains following grafts of murine neural stem cells
without lineage restriction has recently been attributed to
an enhanced myelination in the spared white matter
[14,15]. These studies indicate that enhancing myelina￾tion by transplantation of stem/progenitor cells is a prom￾ising approach to improve functional outcomes for
patients suffering from SCI.
An increasing number of molecular factors that govern the
fate determination of neural cells during development
have been identified [16-18]. Manipulation of appropri￾ate factors may facilitate differentiation of transplanted
cells to a desired lineage. The basic HLH transcription fac￾tor Olig is a key regulator for the differentiation of oli￾godendrocyte lineage cells during development [19-21].
Olig2, one of the Olig family, is more highly expressed in
the ventral spinal cord during early developmental period
of human fetus and may play a crucial role in the differen￾tiation of oligodendrocytes in the spinal cord [22]. In the
present study, we overexpressed Olig2 gene in stable
immortalized human neural stem cells (NSCs), which
have been widely employed to repair the CNS in various
experimental models of neurological disorders [23-28].
Here we show that overexpression of Olig2 transcription
factor directed differentiation of human NSCs exclusively
into an oligodendrocyte lineage in vitro. We also report
that transplantation of Olig2 overexpressing human NSCs
improved locomotor function and increased the extent of
myelination of spared white matter in a rat SCI model.
Results
Characterization of NSCs transduced with Olig2 
transcription factor
Human NSC line overexpressing Olig2 (F3.Olig2) was
generated by retroviral transduction of parental F3 human
NSC line with the full length coding region of bHLH tran￾scription factor Olig2. Introduction of Olig2 gene resulted
in a change of cellular morphology (Figure 1A, B).
F3.Olig2 cells exhibited multiple thin-branched cytoplas￾mic processes in a phase-contrast image, whereas F3 NSCs
showed polygonal shape without the branched processes.
RT-PCR analysis confirmed expression of Olig2 mRNA in
F3.Olig2 cells. Nkx2.2, a transcription factor which
directly regulates the differentiation and maturation of
oligodendrocytes [29], was not expressed in F3 parental
NSCs but newly expressed after introduction Olig2 gene
(Figure 1C). Olig2 expression at the protein level was also
confirmed by immunocytochemistry (Figure 1D, E).
Immunocytochemical analysis of phenotypic expression
showed that essentially all of F3.Olig2 cells expressed oli￾godendrocytic lineage markers such as O4 and GalC (Fig￾ure 1G, I), whereas the expression of those markers was
rarely observed in F3 NSCs (Figure 1F, H). F3.Olig2 cells
also expressed myelin basic protein (MBP) (Figure 1J, K),
indicating that F3.Olig2 cells could differentiate into mye￾linating mature oligodendrocytes. These results indicate
that ectopic overexpression of Olig2 transcription factor
in NSCs turns on transcriptional machinery for the oli￾godendrocytic cell fate and forces F3 human NSCs to dif￾ferentiate into oligodendrocytic lineage path. However,
F3.Olig2 cells did not show differentiation into mature
astrocytes or neurons (See Additional file 1).
Transplantation of NSCs transduced with Olig2 
transcription factor into contused rat spinal cord
Animals received vehicle injection or cellular grafts 7 days
after contusive SCI. At 2 weeks after transplantation,
grafted cells that were immunoreactive to human specific
mitochondria (either F3 or F3.Olig2) were found in clus￾ters mostly around the lesion sites (Figure 2A-D). At 7
weeks, both F3 and F3.Olig2 cells were still observed in
the contused spinal cord (Figure 2E, F). Unexpectedly, the
number of F3.Olig2 cells was markedly larger than that of
F3 NSCs along the rostrocaudal extent of the lesioned spi￾nal cord at this time point. The number of F3.Olig2 cells
was highest around the rostral injection site (2 mm rostral
to the epicenter) (Figure 2G). Differences in the number
of surviving grafted cells between F3 and F3.Olig2 cells
were statistically significant over the different rostrocau￾dal regions from the epicenter (p < 0.001 by repeated
measures two-way ANOVA). At this time point, distribu￾tion of grafted F3.Olig2 cells was different from that of F3
cells. Many of grafted F3.Olig2 cells seemed to migrate
from the injection site and occupied the white matter. In

contrast, most F3 cells without Olig2 overexpression were
still positioned inside the gray matter or around the lesion
cavities, with only about 10% of them observed in the
ventrolateral white matter (Figure 2H). Differences in the
pattern of distribution were most apparent at the rostral
regions, where the proportions of grafted cells within the
white matter were 5 fold higher in F3.Olig2 NSCs (Figure
2F). The percent grafted cells within the white matter ver￾sus total human mitochondria positive cells in the entire
cross section was significantly higher in F3.Olig2 than F3
NSCs (p < 0.001, by repeated measures two-way ANOVA).
Taken together, these results suggest that overexpression
of Olig2 transcription factor leads to an increase in the
number of surviving grafted cells in the contused spinal
cord. In addition, they also indicate that grafted cells with
Olig2 transcription factor possess propensity for migra￾tion towards the white matter.
A recent study indicated that Olig2 transcription factor
plays a critical role in the regulation of NSC proliferation
[30]. It is conceivable, therefore, that the presence of
higher number of F3.Olig2 cells may be due to a height￾ened proliferative activity induced by ectopic expression
of Olig2 transcription factor. Consistent with this idea,
growth of F3.Olig2 cells in vitro was significantly acceler￾ated after 24 hours in culture (Fig 3A). Differences in cell
proliferation were highly significant at both 48 and 72
hours (p < 0.001 by unpaired T test). BrdU incorporation
index was also obtained as a marker of cellular prolifera￾tion at 36 hours when the slope of proliferation curve was
steepest (Fig 3B). F3.Olig2 cells incorporated proliferation
marker BrdU far more frequently than F3 cells (p < 0.001).
More importantly, grafted F3.Olig2 NSCs at 2 weeks after
transplantation were positive for proliferation marker
Ki67 more frequently (> 2.5 fold) than F3 (Figure 3C-I) (p
< 0.01). These results indicate that Olig2 overexpression
can increase the size of proliferative progenitor pool and
the higher proliferative potential may explain the larger
number of F3.Olig2 cells in the injured spinal cord at 7
weeks after transplantation.
Differentiation of F3.Olig2 cells in the contused spinal cord
Differentiation of grafted F3 or F3.Olig2 NSCs was exam￾ined at 7 weeks after transplantation. F3.Olig2 cells iden￾tified by human specific mitochondria that migrated to
the spared white matter were colocalized with oli￾godendrocyte marker APC-CC1 (Figure 4A-F). In contrast,
as shown in Figure 2C, F3 NSCs without Olig2 transcrip￾tion factor were rarely found in the spared white matter,
and even a majority of F3 cells that migrated to the white
matter did not express APC-CC1 (Figure 4G). Interest￾ingly, F3.Olig2 cells that remained in the gray matter or
around the lesion cavity showed different behaviors (Fig￾ure 4H). They were usually found in aggregation and dif￾ferentiation into APC-CC1 positive oligodendrocytes was

very infrequently observed when compared to those cells
positioned in the white matter. Quantification showed
that 52.6 ± 9.8% of grafted F3.Olig2 NSCs were colocal￾ized with APC-CC1 as compared to 7.7 ± 5.9% for paren￾tal F3 cells (Figure 4N) (p < 0.001). When the
measurement was confined to the white matter, 84.9 ±
2.2% of F3.Olig2 NSCs were doubly positive for human
specific mitochondria and APC-CC1. F3.Olig2 NSCs in
the spared white matter also express MBP (Figure 4I-J), a
cell type specific marker for myelinating oligodendro￾cytes, suggesting that F3.Olig2 cells in the spared white
matter differentiated into mature oligodendrocytes that
were capable of producing myelin. Consistent with these
results, most F3.Olig2 NSCs in the white matter did not
colocalize with astroglial marker GFAP (Figure 4K). In the
gray matter, a small proportion of F3.Olig2 NSCs
expressed GFAP. F3 NSCs in the gray matter showed a very
similar extent of differentiation into astrocytes (Figure
4L). Overall, approximately 10% of both F3 and F3.Olig2
cells differentiated into astrocytes (Figure 4N). Neuronal
differentiation was rarely observed in either F3 or
F3.Olig2 NSCs in the gray matter (data not shown). These
findings suggested that the majority of F3.Olig2 or F3
NSCs in the gray matter remained undifferentiated.
Indeed, many of F3 or F3.Olig2 NSCs in the gray matter,
especially around the lesion cavities, were still positive for
immature NSC marker nestin (Figure 4M).
Transplantation of F3.Olig2 NSCs increased the volume of 
spared white matter and enhanced tissue sparing
The areas of myelinated white matter were measured in
the eriochrome-stained transverse spinal cord sections
(Fig 5A-C), and the volume of spared white matter was
calculated using Cavalieri's Principle. Transplantation of
F3 NSCs did not affect the mean volume of spared white
matter compared to Vehicle group (11.4 ± 2.6 mm3 in
Vehicle and 10.9 ± 2.0 mm3 in F3 groups). In contrast,
F3.Olig2 grafts significantly increased the volume of
spared white matter compared to Vehicle and F3 groups
(13.8 ± 2.7 mm3 in F3.Olig2 group; p < 0.05 by one-way
ANOVA followed by Tukey's posthoc analysis) (Figure 5D).
We also measured the volume of cystic cavities, and found
that transplantation of F3.Olig2 NSCs significantly
reduced the volume of cystic cavities (2.2 ± 1.8 mm3 in

significant differences in the volume of cavities between
the three groups (p < 0.01), and Tukey's posthoc analysis
showed a significant difference only between Vehicle and
F3.Olig2 groups (p < 0.01).
Extent of myelination in the spared white matter
The observation that F3.Olig2 NSCs in the white matter
differentiated into mature oligodendrocytes and that
transplantation of F3.Olig2 NSCs increased the volume of
spared white matter led us to examine the extent of mye￾lination in the white matter. Thickness of individual mye￾lin sheaths and diameter of the axons were measured in
semithin (1 μm) spinal cord sections stained with toluid￾ine blue (3 rats and 692 axons in Vehicle, 6 and 1311 in
F3, 7 and 1348 in F3.Olig2 groups, respectively). In tolui￾dine blue stained transverse sections, regions devoid of
myelinated axons were frequently observed in the white
matter after SCI (Figure 6A). Such demyelinated regions
were less frequent in animals with F3.Olig2 grafts (Figure
6A-C). Degenerating axons were also less frequently
observed in F3.Olig2 group. We found that the mean mye￾lin ratio was higher in animals with F3 cells compared to
Vehicle group (Figure 6E). Transplantation of F3.Olig2
cells further increased the mean myelin ratio. One-way
ANOVA revealed a significant group effect on the thick￾ness of myelin sheath (p < 0.001). Tukey's posthoc analysis
showed significant differences between F3.Olig2 and
Vehicle or F3 groups (p < 0.001 or p < 0.05, respectively),
and the difference between F3 and Vehicle groups was
also significant (p < 0.05). Distribution of the myelin ratio
in F3.Olig2 group was most shifted to the right compared
to the other groups in the cumulative frequency histogram
(Figure 6E), indicating that a higher proportion of axons
were ensheathed by thicker myelin in animals with
F3.Olig2 grafts.

Transplantation of F3.Olig2 NSCs improves locomotor 
recovery
BBB locomotor rating scale was used to assess the extent
of locomotor recovery. Most animals were not able to
move their hindlimbs or showed only slight movement of
their hip and/or knee joints immediately after contusive
injury at the T9 segment. The locomotor deficits were rap￾idly recovered during the first two weeks regardless of
treatment (Figure 7A). The average locomotor scale of the
animals with vehicle injection or transplantation of F3
hNSCs began to plateau at 3 weeks and did not show
remarkable changes until 7 weeks after injury, the last
time point measured. Animals with F3.Olig2 grafts con￾tinuously improved locomotor score even after 3 weeks of
injury to the extent where they could regain coordination
between the fore- and hindlimbs with almost consistent
weight-supported plantar steps (average BBB scale 12.8).
Repeated measures two-way ANOVA revealed a signifi￾cant treatment effect over time (p < 0.05). Tukey's posthoc
analysis at each time point showed significant differences
in the mean BBB score from 4 weeks after injury (p < 0.05
at 4 and 5 weeks; p < 0.01 at 6 and 7 weeks). We also meas￾ured the number of paw placement errors in grid walk,
which is generally regarded as more challenging to injured
animals than open field locomotion. Although sham
operated animals crossed the grid runway with very few
errors, injured animals made more than ten errors per
each run (Figure 7B), suggesting that spinal injury severely
compromised the sensorimotor integration of the hind￾limbs. Transplantation of either F3 or F3.Olig2 cells did
not significantly reduce the number errors on grid.

The quality of hindlimbs movement during locomotion
was also measured using footprint analysis. Spinal injury
resulted in an increase of the distance between the two
hindlimbs (interlimb distance) by about 40% (Figure
7C). Transplantation of F3 cells slightly reduced the dis￾tance, and the animals with F3.Olig2 grafts almost com￾pletely normalized the interlimb distance (p < 0.05). The
animals with spinal injury also exhibited shorter stride
length in both limbs than sham operated rats. Transplan￾tation of F3.Olig2 cells tended to restore normal stride
length, although the difference was not statistically signif￾icant (Figure 7D, E). These results suggest that grafting
hNSCs transduced with Olig2 transcription factor into the
contused spinal cord enhances recovery of open field
locomotion and improves quality of the hindlimbs move￾ment during locomotion.
Discussion
In the present study, we demonstrated that transduction
of human NSCs with Olig2 transcription factor induces
the expression of various phenotypic markers of the oli￾godendrocyte in vitro. The Olig transcription factors
(Olig1 and Olig2) are required for the phenotypic deter￾mination of oligodendrocytes during development.
Genetic ablation of Olig transcription factors resulted in
the absence of oligodendrocytes and motor neurons [31-
33]. In the spinal cord, Olig2 seems to play a more crucial
role for the specification of oligodendrocyte phenotype,
since Olig2 expression in the early spinal cord is higher
than that of Olig1 [19,20,22]. In the present study, over￾expression of Olig2 in the human NSCs led to an activa￾tion of NKX2.2, which is known to initiate the expression
of oligodendrocyte-specific proteins in collaboration with
Olig2 [29,34]. This finding is consistent with the recent
reports that overexpression of Olig2 transcription factor is
sufficient to induce the expression of Nkx2.2 and differen￾tiation of neural stem/progenitor cells into oligodendro￾cytes [35,36]. Taken together, these results indicate that
forced expression of Olig2 is sufficient to activate the cel￾lular machinery in NSCs that favors phenotypic differen￾tiation into oligodendrocytes.
Although F3.Olig2 cells in the white matter differentiated
into APC-CC1 positive oligodendrocytes, the same cells
that remained in the gray matter exhibited different bio￾logical behaviors. F3.Olig2 cells in the gray matter very
infrequently differentiated into mature oligodendrocytes
or any other neural cells. F3 NSCs, which are mostly con￾fined around the lesioned areas, also showed very poor
differentiation potential. This phenomenon indicates that
lesion environment of the spinal cord (especially gray
regions around the lesion cavities in this study) inhibits
differentiation of transplanted cells as previously reported
[37,38]. In F3.Olig2 cells that do not migrate towards the
white matter, genetic modification of differentiation
properties may not be sufficient to override the influence
of lesion environment. Alternatively, adequate environ￾mental factors, which are produced by the white matter,
might be required for proper differentiation of F3.Olig2
cells. F3.Olig2 cells also exhibited much higher capacity
for migration towards the white matter than parental F3
cells. It is possible that demyelinating but intact axons
may produce certain molecular cues to recruit oli￾godendrocyte lineage cells from the transplantation sites
[39]. Most of the parental F3 NSCs without Olig2 overex￾pression, however, might not possess capacity to respond
to such a signal. These observations may exemplify the
importance of an adequate crosstalk between cell-autono￾mous traits of transplanted cells and host environmental
factors for the successful integration of exogenous cellular
grafts.
Transplantation of F3.Olig2 NSCs significantly increased
the volume of myelinated white matter. Furthermore, ani￾mals with F3.Olig2 grafts showed significantly higher
myelin ratio in the spared white matter. These data suggest
a possibility that F3.Olig2 cells differentiated into func￾tional oligodendrocytes and participated in remyelinating
denuded axons in the residual ventrolateral white matter.
It is also possible that F3.Olig2 NSCs in the spared white
matter exerted trophic effects [40], which could prevent
further demyelination and promote endogenous remyeli￾nation process [41]. Our finding that F3 NSC grafts, which
rarely differentiated into oligodendrocytes, also increased
myelin ratio to some extent supports the notion that the
trophic mechanisms were indeed in operation. Therefore,
the higher myelin ratio in animals with transplantation of
F3.Olig2 NSCs could be accounted for by both direct
remyelination and trophic effects by the grafted cells.
We found in the present study that the overall number of
F3.Olig2 cells detected at 7 weeks after transplantation
was larger than that of NSCs across the rostrocaudal extent
of the spinal cord examined. A recent study has reported
that Olig2 critically regulates replication competence in
neural stem cells and malignant glioma [30]: for example,
loss of Olig2 resulted in a dramatic reduction of neural
stem cell proliferation. Our data also demonstrated that
Olig2 overexpressing human NSCs possess higher prolif￾erative capacity in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, the larger
number of F3.Olig2 cells detected after the transplanta￾tion could be explained by the influence of Olig2 gene on
proliferation potential of NSCs. Despite the proliferation￾promoting effect of Olig2 gene, we did not observe a gross
tumor formation. This is consistent with the fact that
Olig2 is not sufficient for brain cancer formation [30]. It
is conceivable that the increase in the number of grafted
cells may have contributed to a better preservation of spi￾nal cord tissue in animals with F3.Olig2 grafts. Many of
F3.Olig2 or F3 cells that stayed in the gray matter or

around the lesion cavity did not acquire any mature phe￾notype. These undifferentiated progenitor cells can exert
neuroprotective effects by paracrine actions from secreted
molecules or via an immunomodulatory mechanism
[42,43]. Furthermore, undifferentiated NSCs can promote
axonal sprouting/regeneration by producing neuro￾trophic factors or acting as a kind of cellular guidance
[44,45]. F3 human NSCs have been shown to produce
various neurotrophic factors [26,28]. The presence of a
much larger number of grafted NSCs in F3.Olig2 group
could promote tissue sparing or axonal growth of a much
larger magnitude, which then resulted in the reduction of
cavity volume. It is likely that the neuroprotective and/or
neuroregenerative mechanism by grafted F3.Olig2 cells,
together with enhanced myelination in the white matter,
contributed to improvement in the quality of locomotion.
The animals grafted with F3.Olig2 cells improved quality
of hindlimb locomotion as assessed by BBB score and
footprint analysis. They exhibited better coordination
between hind- and forelimbs. The smaller distance
between the two hindlimbs (interlimbs distance) in ani￾mals with F3.Olig2 grafts suggests an improved balance
during locomotion. However, there was no difference in
the number of errors in grid walk test between the treat￾ment groups. Walking on the grid runway requires precise
motor control (hindlimbs placement) integrated with
sensory information on the grid and thus depends on the
integrity of supraspinal projections more heavily than
spontaneous locomotor behavior [46,47]. Regaining
supraspinal control may not be achieved merely by
enhancement of myelination without regeneration of sev￾ered axons. In this regard, it may be necessary to combine
strategies that are aimed at inducing axonal regeneration
to achieve more meaningful functional improvement
after SCI.
Several studies have highlighted the therapeutic benefits
of supplying new oligodendrocytes by transplantation of
stem/progenitor cells following SCI [11,12,15,48]. Trans￾plantation of retinoic acid-treated or predifferentiated
embryonic stem cells resulted in differentiation into oli￾godendrocyte lineage and improvement of behavioral
recovery after SCI [12,48]. Although no tumor formation
was reported, the possibility of teratocarcinoma forma￾tion in a longer term still raises a safety issue in using
embryonic stem cells. Transplantation of multipotent or
glial lineage-restricted neural stem/progenitor cells also
successfully promoted myelination and enhanced func￾tional recovery [11,15]. However, the efficiency of oli￾godendrocyte differentiation might be unsatisfactory or
additional measures would be needed to improve the dif￾ferentiation efficiency [49]. The present study is the first to
utilize a molecular factor governing the fate determina￾tion of oligodendrocytes to enforce oligodendrocytic dif￾ferentiation following SCI. The beneficial outcomes of the
current approach would provide a promising alternative
to supply myelinating oligodendrocytes for spinal cord
repair.
Conclusion
The present study showed that transplantation of human
NSCs genetically modified to express Olig2 transcription
factor into the contused spinal cord enhances the extent of
myelination in the spared white matter and improved
locomotor recovery. Transplantation of neural stem/pro￾genitor cells genetically modified to differentiate into oli￾godendrocytic lineage may be an effective strategy to
improve functional outcomes following traumatic inju￾ries to the spinal cord. Our study further suggests that
manipulation of molecular factors governing cell fate
decisions during development can influence the fate of
grafted neural stem/progenitor cells and positively affect
the reparative potential of the transplantation therapy.
Methods
Culture of human neural stem cells
Primary dissociated cell cultures of fetal human telen￾cephalon tissues of 14 weeks gestation were prepared as
described previously [23,50,51]. The cells were grown in
T25 flasks in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM;
HyClone, Logan, UT), supplemented with high glucose,
5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 20 μg/ml gentamicin
(Sigma, St Louis, MO), and 2.5 μg/ml amphotericin B
(Sigma). The medium was changed twice a week. The per￾mission to use the fetal tissues was granted by the Clinical
Research Screening Committee involving Human Subjects
of the University of British Columbia, and the fetal tissues
were obtained from the Anatomical Pathology Depart￾ment of Vancouver General Hospital.
PA317 amphotropic packaging cell line was infected with
the recombinant replication-incompetent retroviral vec￾tor pLNX.v-myc, and the supernatants from the packaging
cells were used to infect NSCs in human fetal telen￾cephalon cultures. Stably transfected colonies were
selected by neomycine resistance. Several stable clones of
human NSCs were isolated, and one of them, HB1.F3 (F3
hereafter), was expanded for the present study. F3 human
NSCs express ABCG2, nestin, and Musashi1, which are
cell type specific markers for NSCs [28,52,53].
To generate Olig2 overexpressing human NSC line
(F3.Olig2), Olig2 cDNA (a generous gift from Dr. Takeba￾yashi, Okazaki, Japan) was ligated into multiple cloning
sites of the retroviral vector pLPCX. PA317 amphotropic
packaging cell line was infected with the recombinant ret￾roviral vector, and the supernatants from the packaging
cells were added to the F3 cells. Stably transfected colonies
were selected by puromycine resistance.

RT-PCR and immunocytochemistry
For RT-PCR analysis, NSCs were grown on poly-L-lysine
coated Petri dishes in DMEM with 2% FBS for 3 days.
Total RNA was extracted from cultured cells using Trizol
(GIBCO-BRL). One μg of total RNA was reverse-tran￾scribed into first-strand cDNA using oligo-dT primer
(Promega, Madison, WI). For PCR amplification, specific
primer pairs were incubated with 1 μl of cDNA in a 20 μl
reaction mixture containing Taq polymerase. The
sequences of the primers were as follows; AAATCGCATC￾CAGATTTTC/CACTGCCTCCTAGCTTGTC for Olig2,
TCTACGACAGCAGCGACAAC/CTTGGAGCTTGAGTC￾CTGAG for Nkx2.2, CATGACCACAGTCCATGCCAT￾CACT/TGAGGTCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA for GAPDH.
To examine phenotypic differentiation, human NSCs
were grown on poly-L-lysine coated 9 mm Aclar fluorocar￾bon plastic coverslips in DMEM with 2% FBS for 5 days.
Cells were washed three times with phosphate buffered
saline (PBS) and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde
for 10 minutes. After blocking with 5% normal goat
serum, cells were incubated with primary antibodies for 2
hours at room temperature (RT). The following primary
antibodies were used to examine the expression of neural
cell phenotypic markers; anti-O4 (1:5; mouse mono￾clonal; Kim Lab), anti-galactocerebrosidase (GalC) (1:5;
mouse monoclonal; Kim Lab), anti-myelin basic protein
(MBP) (1:500; rabbit polyclonal; Chemicon, Temecula,
CA), anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (1:500; rab￾bit polyclonal; Chemicon), and anti-MAP2 (1:200; rabbit
polyclonal; Chemicon). The coverslips were then incu￾bated with appropriate secondary antibodies tagged with
Alex-488 or Alexa-594 fluorophores (Molecular probes,
Eugene, OR) for an hour. The nuclei were stained with 4',
6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Sigma) before
mounting on the slides.
Proliferation assay
Growth rate of NSCs was determined by measuring viable
cell numbers at different time points after plating. The
number of cells was measured by Cell Counting Kit-8
(Dojindo Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan) according to
the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were dis￾pensed as 100 μl of cell suspension (1000 cells/well) in a
96-well plate. Ten μl of CCK-8 solutions were added to
each well at different time points (0, 6, 12, 18, 24, 48, and
72 hours), and the plate was incubated at 37°C for 4 h.
The absorbance value at 450 nm wavelength was meas￾ured with a dual-beam microtiter plate reader. The exper￾iment was replicated four times with triplicate samples
included in each experiment.
For 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation
experiment, 100 μl of cell suspension (1000 cells/well)
was plated on a 9 mm coverslip and incubated for 36
hours. BrdU (final concentration 2 μM, Sigma) was added
to each well for 2 hours followed by immunocytochemis￾try as described above using anti-BrdU (1:500; rat mono￾clonal; Oxford, UK). Counting was performed in three
randomly selected fields (×200) and the average value was
obtained from three coverslips for each condition. The
percent of BrdU positive cells out of all DAPI stained
nuclei was obtained as BrdU incorporation index.
Animals and surgery
Adult female Sprague Dawley rats (250 - 300 gram, Orient
Bio Inc. Seongnam, Korea) were used in this study. All rats
were maintained on a 12:12 hour dark and light cycle
with food and water provided ad libitum. After being anes￾thetized with 4% chloral hydrate (10 ml/kg, injected
intraperitoneally), rats were subjected to a dorsal laminec￾tomy at the 9th thoracic vertebral level (T9-10) to expose
the dorsal surface of the spinal cord. The NYU spinal cord
impactor was used to inflict a standardized contusion; a
10 g impactor head was dropped from a height of 12.5
mm onto the exposed T9-10 spinal cord. Muscles and sub￾cutaneous tissues were sutured in layer, and the skin was
stapled. Sham operation involved only laminectomy
without contusion on the spinal cord. The bladder was
manually expressed twice daily until the animals resumed
self voiding. Seven days after spinal injury, the spinal cord
was reexposed for cellular transplantation. Animals were
randomly divided into three groups: 1) vehicle (PBS)
injected (Vehicle group), 2) transplantation of F3 cells (F3
group), and 3) transplantation of F3.Olig2 cells (F3.Olig2
group). Two injections were made at 2 mm rostral and
caudal to the epicenter using a glass micropipette (tip
diameter < 70 μm) configured with Hamilton syringe. The
pipette pierced the dorsal spinal cord slightly off the dor￾sal median sulcus, avoiding blood vessels at the midline.
We advanced the pipette with a depth of 1.2 mm from the
dorsal surface and kept it for 3 minutes during the injec￾tion which was controlled by Nanoliter syringe pump (KD
scientific; Holliston, MA, USA). Each injection consisted
of 1 × 105 of the dissociated cells in 2 μl of PBS. Thus, a
total of 2 × 105 cells were transplanted for each animal. To
prevent leakage from the injection site, the pipette was
maintained for three more minutes and then withdrawn
slowly. Animals were assigned with new identification
codes after transplantation to ensure blind evaluation of
behavioral performance. All animals received daily intra￾peritoneal injection of cyclosporine (Sandimmun;
Novartis, Bern, Switzerland) at a dosage of 10 mg/kg,
beginning from one day prior to transplantation to three
weeks after transplantation. After that, cyclosporine (50
μg/ml) was administered through drinking water until
animals were sacrificed. Prophylactic antibiotics were
intraperitoneally injected on the next day after each sur￾gery.

Assessment of locomotor recovery
A total of 35 animals (N = 11, 12, and 12 for Vehicle, F3,
and F3.Olig2 groups, respectively), divided in three series,
underwent behavioral tests to assess locomotor recovery.
The BBB (Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan) locomotor rating
scale was used to assess the extent of locomotor recovery
during open field locomotion. Two experimenters who
were blind to experimental conditions scored BBB scale
separately and the average of the two scores was obtained.
The grid walk test was conducted at 4 and 7 weeks after
initial injury. We performed grid walk test for the second
and third series of animals, so the animal in the first series
were excluded (total 5; Vehicle = 1, F3 = 3, F3.Olig2 = 2).
For grid walk, rats were trained to cross a grid runway (30
cm × 140 cm with 50 × 50 mm holes) for a water reward.
Two animals in Vehicle group and one animal in F3.Olig2
group could not be trained adequately enough to undergo
grid walk test. Therefore, grid walk data were obtained
from 27 rats (Vehicle = 8, F3 = 9, F3.Olig2 = 9). On the day
of test, four runs were recorded using a three-CCD digital
video camera (NV-GS250, Panasonic, Japan), and later
analyzed frame by frame in slow motion. The average
number of limb placement errors per run was obtained for
each animal. For footprint analysis, rats were trained to
walk on a runway with a narrow alley made of transparent
Plexiglas (7 cm × 170 cm) on top for a water reward dur￾ing the same training session for grid walk. The animals'
hindpaws were inked and footprints were obtained on
white paper covering the floor of the runway. The base of
support, which is a distance between the two hindlimbs,
was determined by measuring the distance between the
central pads of both hindpaws. Right and left stride
lengths were measured between two consecutive prints on
each side. Footprint analysis was performed only in the
third series of animals (total 14; Vehicle = 4, F3 = 5,
F3.Olig2 = 5). Normal foot print data were obtained from
5 rats with sham operation.
Histological processing and immunohistochemistry
For histological analysis, animals were anesthetized with
an overdose of chloral hydrate and perfused with
heparinized saline (0.9%), followed by 4% paraformalde￾hyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. The spinal cord
was dissected and post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at
RT for 2 hours, followed by cryoprotection in a graded
series of sucrose solutions (10%-30%) in 0.1 M phos￾phate buffer at 4°C. Transverse sections (20 μm) of the
spinal cord were cut using cryostat (Leica CM 1900; Wet￾zlar, Germany) in a 1:10 series and thaw-mounted onto
silane-coated glass slides. To quantify the area of myeli￾nated white matter, transverse spinal cord sections were
stained with eriochrome cyanine that stains myelinated
white matter [54]. The transverse sections were immersed
for 8 minutes in the staining solution consisting of 240 ml
of 0.2% eriochrome cyanine RC (Sigma) and 10 ml of
10% FeCl3·6H2O (Sigma) in 3% HCl. The sections were
then washed with running tap water, followed by differen￾tiation in 1% aqueous NH4OH.
For immunohistochemistry, transverse spinal cord sec￾tions were incubated overnight at 4°C with anti-human
mitochondria (1:400; mouse monoclonal; Chemicon),
anti-Ki-67 (1:500; rabbit polyclonal; Novocastra, Newcas￾tle, UK), anti-myelin basic protein (MBP) (1:400; rabbit
polyclonal; Chemicon), anti-APC-CC1 (1:200; mouse
monoclonal; Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA), anti-GFAP
(1:500; rabbit polyclonal; Chemicon), anti-nestin (1:500;
rabbit polyclonal; Chemicon), and anti-MAP2 (1:200:
rabbit polyclonal; Chemicon). The spinal cord sections
were washed and then incubated with biotinylated or
fluorophore-tagged secondary antibodies. For chromoge￾nic detection of antigen-antibody reaction, preformed avi￾din-biotinylated peroxidase complexes were applied for
30 minutes, followed by incubation with peroxidase sub￾strate (DAB) until desired intensity developed. For fluo￾rescence staining, coverslips were mounted onto glass
slides using Gelvatol and examined under Olympus con￾focal laser scanning microscope (Model FV 300, Tokyo,
Japan).
To analyze the thickness of myelin sheath wrapping indi￾vidual axons, a separate series of animals (16 rats; Vehicle
= 3, F3 = 6, F3.Olig2 = 7) were perfused with modified
Karnovsky's fixative solution (2% glutaraldehyde and 1%
paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer). Dissected
spinal cord was divided into smaller blocks with about 5
mm in length. The tissue block containing caudal regions
to the epicenter was transversely sectioned into 200 μm
slices with a vibratome (model Vibratome Series 1000;
Technical Products Int'l. Inc., O'Fallon, MO). The slices
containing the regions around 1 mm caudal to the epi￾center were immersed in 1% OsO4 solution, and then
embedded in Poly/Bed 812 embedding media (Poly￾sciences Inc., Warrington, PA). Transverse semithin (1
μm) sections were cut from the rostral surface with glass
knife and then stained with toluidine blue.
Quantitative cell counting and image analysis
Human mitochondria positive cells (developed with DAB
substrates) were counted using unbiased stereology. Two
transverse sections 200 μm apart from each other at the
epicenter, ± 1 mm, ± 2 mm, ± 3 mm, and ± 4 mm rostral
and caudal from the epicenter were chosen. Cell counting
was performed on an Olympus BX51 Microscope with a
MAC 6000 Motorized Stage Encoder System that was cou￾pled with a computer running Stereo Investigator 8 soft￾ware (MBF Bioscience, Williston, VT). Human
mitochondria positive cells within optical dissectors ran￾domly placed in regions of interest were counted using
standard stereological criteria for inclusion. Stereological

estimates were done in a systematic way using the formula
in the software. The average of the two sections at each
level was obtained for each animal. The percentage of the
cell number in the spared ventrolateral white matter was
calculated by dividing the number of cells in the ventrola￾teral white matter by the total number in the entire sec￾tion. To determine the percentage of grafted human NSCs
that were colocalized with proliferation marker Ki67 or
neural cell specific markers, two transverse sections with
the highest graft survival were chosen for each animal. The
number of human NSCs colocalized with these markers
was counted in the entire section and divided by the total
number of human mitochondria positive cells. The aver￾age from the two sections was calculated as the final per￾centage value for each animal.
The volume of myelinated white matter and cystic cavities
were determined for the animals that completed behavio￾ral tests. Every 10th eriochrome-stained transverse spinal
cord sections were viewed on an optical microscope
(Olympus BX41). The section containing injury epicenter
was defined visually as the one with a smallest visible rim
of spared myelin. Then, serial sections with an equal dis￾tance (400 μm) spanning ± 2 mm from epicenter were
imaged at a 40× magnification and captured with CCD
camera (Olympus DP11). Myelinated spared ventrola￾teral white matter anterior to the dorsal horn was drawn
with the Pen Tablet input device (Bamboo MTE-450K;
Wacom Co., Tokyo, Japan) on each image and the cross￾sectional areas were measured using publicly available
Image J software (NIH, Bethesada, MD). The total esti￾mated volume was calculated using the Cavalieri's Princi￾ple. The individual subvolumes were obtained by
multiplying the cross-sectional area by the distance
between sections, and the subvolumes were summed to
generate the total volume of spared white matter (∑n
[cross sectional areas × intersection distance], n = number
of sections analyzed). The volume of cystic cavities was
calculated by the same equation.
Thickness of myelin sheath in individual axons was deter￾mined on toluidine blue stained transverse semithin sec￾tions. Two sections with adequate preparation were
selected for each animal. In order to have corresponding
regions imaged across all the animals, a single image field
(120 μm × 90 μm) per section was located in the ventral
white matter just anterior to the ventral gray horn by an
independent experimenter who was blind to the experi￾mental conditions. Images were taken at 1000× magnifi￾cation using a Zeiss Axiophot upright microscopy
equipped with Axiocam HR digital camera. Horizontal
grid lines with a 10 μm interval were drawn using Pho￾toshop software and the same grid lines were applied to
all images. Only the axons that were intersected by the
grid lines were included for quantification. The thickness
of myelin sheath and the shortest axon diameter were
measured using the Image J software. According to the
previously published report by Karimi-Abdolrezaee et al.
(2006) [15], the myelin ratio was obtained by dividing
the total axonal diameter including thickness of myelin
sheath by the diameter of axonal fiber excluding myelin
sheath.
Statistical methods
Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS version 12.0
(Chicago, IL, USA) or GraphPad Prism software version
4.0 (San Diego, CA, USA). The unpaired Student T test or
one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post hoc test was
used for statistical comparison of group means. Repeated
measures two-way ANOVA was used to compare the
number of cells or the percent cells in the white matter at
different regions and BBB locomotor scores at multiple
time points.
