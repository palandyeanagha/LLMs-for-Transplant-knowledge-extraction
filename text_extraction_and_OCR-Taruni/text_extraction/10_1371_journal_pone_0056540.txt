Abstract
Animal models have shown that regional anesthesia (combined with or without general anesthesia) would attenuate the
surgical stress response by preserving immune function and result in better long-term outcome. In order to test the
hypothesis that cancer patients who had surgery with epidural anesthesia (EA) would have better outcome (either overall
survival [OS] or recurrence-free survival [RFS]) than those who were general anesthesia (GA), we performed this meta￾analysis. By searching relevant literature, a total of 14 studies containing 18 sub-studies (seven in OS analysis and eleven in
RFS analysis) were identified and meta-analyzed. Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used
to assess the strength of association. For OS, the random-effects model was used to analyze the data and demonstrated an
OS benefit in favor of EA compared with GA alone (HR = 0.84, 95% CI 0.74–0.96, P = 0.013). The influence analysis showed
the robustness of the results. Specifically, a significantly positive association between EA and improved OS was observed in
colorectal cancer (HR = 0.65, 95% CI 0.43–0.99, P = 0.045). For RFS, the random-effects model was used to analyze the data
and no significant relationship between RFS benefit and EA (HR = 0.88, 95% CI 0.64–1.22, P = 0.457) was detected. In
conclusion, our meta-analysis suggests that epidural anesthesia and/or analgesia might be associated with improved overall
survival in patients with operable cancer undergoing surgery (especially in colorectal cancer), but it does not support an
association between epidural anesthesia and cancer control. Prospective studies are needed to determine whether the
association between epidural use and survival is causative.

Introduction
Most surgery needs a procedure of anesthesia. Addition of
epidural anesthesia and analgesia to the general anesthesia
(referred to as EA in this paper) may be beneficial compared with
general anesthesia (GA) because epidural anesthesia may provide
better postoperative pain relief, reduce incidence of side-effects,
and decrease the possibility of occurrence of immunosuppressive
factors such as anesthetic drugs and opioids.[1–3] Regional
anesthesia largely prevents the neuroendocrine stress response to
surgery by blocking afferent neural transmission from reaching the
central nervous system and activating the stress response and by
blocking descending efferent activation of the sympathetic nervous
system, so few opioids (if any) are needed. [3] Animal models have
shown that regional anesthesia (combined with or without general
anesthesia) would attenuate the surgical stress response by
preserving immune function and result in better long-term
outcome. [4].
To a large extend, the opposing forces of immune surveillance
and a tumor’s ability to spread determine whether local recurrence
or metastasis occurs, even, good or poor survival. By reducing the
surgical stress response and significantly reducing exposure to
opioids (though morphine shows an antiangiogenic potential [5]),
regional anesthetic techniques (under most circumstance, com￾bined with general anesthesia) may suppress immune function less
than opioid analgesia. Consistent with this hypothesis, some,
though not all, studies have shown that there is an association
between improved outcomes after cancer surgery and regional
anesthetic techniques.[2,3,6–8] To further improve our hypothesis
that epidural anesthesia and/or analgesia (combined with or
without GA) might be associated with reduced cancer recurrence
after oncological surgery and subsequently improve overall
survival, we performed this meta-analysis.
Methods
Study Identification and Data Extraction
Relevant studies were searched in the PubMed, Medline, and
Web of Science database (updated to August-1, 2012) using the
following search terms: (‘‘regional anesthesia’’ or ‘‘epidural
anesthesia’’ or ‘‘general anesthesia’’ or ‘‘anesthetic technique’’)
and (‘‘recurrence’’ or ‘‘metastasis’’ or ‘‘survival’’) and (‘‘cancer’’ or
‘‘carcinoma’’). Only those published in English language were
included; we did not define the minimum number of patients to be
included for meta-analysis. Either abstract or full text paper was
eligible. By this search strategy, 731 papers were identified. After
review their titles, 135 were crudely identified to be possibly
eligible. All the 135 abstracts were read; if potentially eligible, the
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 February 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 2 | e56540

full text paper was retrieved and read. The inclusion criteria were:
(i) comparing the effect of EA (combined with or without GA) on
survival or recurrence with that of GA in cancer surgery, (ii)
independent retrospective or prospective study, and (iii) with
sufficient available data to estimate a hazard ratio (HR) with 95%
confidence intervals (CIs). Whenever available, we extracted the
HR adjusted for other prognostic or confounding factors as most
other studies suggested. [9,10] The adjusted HRs rather than
crude odd ratios or relative risks might be more reliable to reflect
the effect of anesthetic technique on survival in human cancers.
After reviewing full text of all the potentially eligible papers, we
identified 14 eligible studies for this meta-analysis. The following
variables were extracted from each study if available: first author’s
surname, publication year, cancer type, design type, numbers in EA
group, number in GA group, and HR with 95% confidence intervals
(CIs) of treatment outcomes. The information was collected
independently by the two authors (C.W.K. and M.C.H.), and any
discrepancy were resolved by discussion. The study quality was
assessed using the 9-star Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (The Newcastle￾Ottawa Scale for assessing the quality of nonrandomized studies in
meta-analyses. Ottawa, Canada: Dept of Epidemiology and
Community Medicine, University of Ottawa. http://www.ohri.ca/
programs/clinical_epidemiology/oxford.htm. Accessed 2013 Jan 1).
We also followed the PRISMA statement for reporting systematic
reviews that evaluate health care interventions. [11].
Statistical Methods
This systematic review and meta-analysis was planned,
conducted, and reported in adherence to the standards of quality
for reporting meta-analysis. [12] For each study, HR with its 95%
CIs was retrieved from paper to estimate the association between
EA and survival outcomes. The heterogeneity among studies was
assessed by Cochran chi-square Q statistics and I-square statistics,
which determined the appropriate use of either fixed-effects
(Mantel-Haenszel method) or random-effects (DerSimonian and
Laird method) model. Heterogeneity was considered as either a P￾value ,0.05 or I-square .25%. [13] The potential publication
bias was examined visually in a funnel plot of ln[OR] against its
standard error (SE), and the degree of asymmetry was tested using
Egger’s test. We also showed the meta-analytic results stratifying
by cancer type and design type. Influence analysis (sensitivity
analysis) was conducted by omitting each study to find potential

outliers. All of the statistical analyses were performed using Stata/
SE version 10.0 (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX).
Results
Basic Characteristics
The literature search flowchart is shown in Figure 1. We
identified 14 eligible studies for this meta-analysis[2,3,6–8,14–22]
(Table 1), consisting of about 35,000 cases in the GA group and
about 12,000 cases in the EA group. There were two study end
points: one was overall survival (OS) and the other was recurrence￾free survival (RFS). RFS was calculated from surgery to the first
occurrence of disease progression or relapse due to the primary
cancer; OS was calculated from surgery to the death from any
cause.
Regarding the OS, there were seven sub-studies involved,[6,14–
17] and four of them showed significant relationship between
improved OS and EA. [6,14,15,17] Five sub-studies were with
regard to colon or rectal cancer.
Regarding the RFS, 11 sub-studies including more than five
types of cancers (breast, prostate, colorectal, cervical, ovarian
cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, etc.) were included for meta￾analysis.[2,3,7,8,16–22] The original results were mixed, with four
of them reported positive associations between EA and improved
RFS.
Association between EA and OS
There was significant between-study heterogeneity (Table 2) in
the HRs for OS (heterogeneity chi-squared = 11.9, P = 0.063, I￾squared = 49.8%) with the cut-off of I-squared at 25%, so the
random-effects model was used to analyze the data and
demonstrated an OS benefit in favor of EA compared to GA
alone (HR = 0.84, 95% CI 0.74–0.96, P = 0.013; Figure 2A). The
similar result was yielded by the exclusion of the results from
Cummings’s study (HR = 0.77, 95% CI 0.61–0.97, P = 0.024;
Figure 2B), which had the largest sample size and may dominate
the meta-analytic results. The further influence analysis also
showed the robustness of our results. Because five [6,14,17] of the
seven studies were regarding colorectal cancer, we then performed
a meta-analysis specific to colon or rectal cancer (Table 2). It
showed a positive association between EA and improved OS
(HR = 0.65, 95% CI 0.43–0.99, P = 0.045). When meta-analysis
was performed by design type, the positive association was more
likely to be observed in the retrospective studies (HR = 0.86, 95%
CI 0.75–0.97, P = 0.019).
Figure 2. Forest plot and influence analysis of meta-analysis. In figure 2A (for overall survival analysis) and 2C (for recurrence-free survival
analysis), each study is shown by the point estimate of the hazard ratio (HR) (the size of the square is proportional to the weight of each study) and
95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the HR (extending lines). Figure 2B and 2D show the influence of individual studies on the summary HR. The vertical
axis indicates the overall HR and the two vertical axes indicate its 95% CIs. Every hollow round indicates the pooled HR when the left study is omitted
in this meta-analysis. The two ends of every broken line represent the respective 95% CIs.

Association between EA and RFS
There was significant between-study heterogeneity in the HRs
for RFS (heterogeneity chi-squared = 88.0, P,0.001, I￾squared = 88.6%), so the random-effects model was used to
analyze the data and no association between RFS and EA was
observed (HR = 0.88, 95% CI 0.64–1.22, P = 0.457; Figure 2C).
The similar results were yielded by exclusion of the results from
Cummings’s study with the largest sample size, and the influence
analysis also showed the comparable results (Figure 2D). Subgroup
analyses were performed in colorectal cancer (study number = 3
[8,17,19]) and prostate cancer (study number = 3 [2,7,20]). Again,
no significant association between EA and improved DFS was
observed.
Publication Bias
Either graphical inspection for funnel plots or quantitative
evaluation from Egger’s test indicated the absence of publication
bias in OS (P = 0.241, Figure 3A) and DFS (P = 0.480, Figure 3B).
Discussion
In the present meta-analysis, our results suggest a beneficial
effect of epidural use on the OS after cancer surgery, especially for
colorectal cancer. Our findings from pooled meta-analysis are
consistent with most, although not all, results from currently
available literature. However, epidural use did not further
decrease the recurrence events of cancer.
Our meta-analysis suggests that epidural anesthesia and/or
analgesia might be associated with improved OS in patients
with operable cancer (especially colorectal cancer) undergoing
surgery. In the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results
(SEER)-based study with the largest sample size, the investiga￾tors indicated a significantly beneficial effect of epidural use on
all-cause mortality after colorectal cancer resection. [17] These
findings, however, were in contrast to those of a prospective
MASTER trial which suggested no difference in OS between
the subsets of patients undergoing surgery for abdominal
malignancies. [16] Besides reports in cancer surgery, meta￾analyses of randomized clinical trials and population-based
cohort studies of other surgeries have also demonstrated that
neuraxial anesthesia might reduce mortality as well as other
serious complications when compared with general anesthe￾sia.[23–26] The significant effect of epidural use on reduced
mortality may be consistent with the theory that there is

suppression of immune defence mechanisms during surgery and
in the postoperative period. [27] Other potential explanation
includes stress response, hemodynamical factors, pain, and
respiratory recovery. Immune compromise could affect the
postoperative infection rate, healing, treatment response, as well
as rate and extent of tumor dissemination during surgery.
Furthermore, anesthesia and surgical procedures have been
reported to suppress natural killer (NK) and T cells activity and
other immune functions for a couple of days. [28–30]
Moreover, EA is superior to GA in shifting the Th1/Th2
balance towards Th1, potentially benefiting hepatocellular
carcinoma patients by promoting anti-tumor Th polarization.
[31] Preservation of immune function has become a strategy to
improve outcome and recent studies suggest that choosing
therapeutic agents or methods that produce a sustained increase
or do not decrease in the immunological function would result
in a better clinical outcome.
As mentioned above, because immune surveillance is a
primary determinant of cancer progression, it is logical to
hypothesize that interventions aimed at reducing exposure to
immunosuppressive factors would decrease patient recurrence
after potentially curative cancer resection. In our study,
however, this has been difficult to demonstrate. Our analysis
found no association between epidural use and cancer
recurrence, even in subgroup analysis for colon or prostate
cancer. It seems that the reduction in mortality probably not
strongly linked to cancer control. Whether negative finding
represents a true association or an underpowered relationship
(because of limited study number) remains to be seen. Taken
together, our results suggest that the impact of epidural
analgesia on cancer recurrence is minor at least. In other
words, although the epidural use during surgery might influence
the ultimate mortality, there should be many factors integrally
influencing the final outcome and a decrease in cancer
recurrence seems not to be the main mechanism by which
the EA works.
Some limitations should be declared. First, our meta-analysis
is limited by the nonrandomized and retrospective nature of the
included studies. Second, there should be other prognostic
factors not controlled in the meta-analysis. Differences in
different surgical techniques, varying patient populations,
changes in defining recurrence, and difficulty with long-term
follow-up all hamper firm conclusions. Third, different cancer
types (between and within cancer types) have differing tumor
biology, whether our conclusion is suitable for all cancer types is
unknown. There is only one study for some cancers, such as
breast cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma. It is still too early
to draw a conclusion for these cancers. Moreover, we only
included studies published in English language and would
introduce so called ‘‘English language bias’’ that may reduce the
precision of combined estimates of treatment effects; this
problem however exists in most currently published meta￾analysis and systemic review.
In conclusion, our meta-analysis suggests that epidural
anesthesia and/or analgesia is associated with improved overall
survival in patients with operable cancer undergoing surgery.
Our results do not support an association between epidural
anesthesia and cancer recurrence. Prospective studies are
needed to determine whether the association between epidural
use and survival is causative.
