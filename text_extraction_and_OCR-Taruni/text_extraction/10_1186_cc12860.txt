Abstract
To gain new insights into renal perfusion and
pathogenesis of acute kidney injury in intensive care
unit (ICU) patients, we need new techniques to
evaluate renal microcirculation. In addition, a bedside
technique applicable in the ICU could be extremely
useful for physicians to adjust the optimal
therapeutic/preventive modalities for kidney perfusion
in each patient. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS)
has been validated to assess and quantify the
microcirculation up to capillary perfusion in several
organs. In a recent issue, Schneider and colleagues
suggest that CEUS is feasible, well tolerated and able
to quantify cortical renal microcirculation in patients
undergoing cardiac surgery. In addition, CEUS
derived-parameters suggest a decrease in renal
perfusion occurring within 24 hours of surgery in
patients at risk of acute kidney injury. This study opens
up new possibilities for the assessment of cortical
renal microcirculation in ICU patients.
Despite our increasing ability to support vital organs and
resuscitate patients, acute kidney injury (AKI) is a fre￾quent complication of cardiac surgery and increases
morbidity and mortality. The primary resuscitation strat￾egy for these patients is to restore effective renal blood
flow (RBF) by fluid resuscitation to maintain adequate
renal microcirculation and parenchymal oxygen and
thereby prevent AKI. However, renal hypoperfusion may
persist despite restoration of global hemodynamics due
to inadequate RBF and renal microcirculatory dysfunc￾tion. Thus, defining the adequacy of resuscitation re￾quires attention to both global and regional perfusion. In
addition, renal hypoperfusion is not the only cause for

development of AKI, and the role of RBF alterations in
the pathogenesis of AKI is still debated. To gain new
insights into renal perfusion and pathogenesis of AKI in
intensive care unit (ICU) patients, we need new tech￾niques to evaluate RBF and kidney microcirculation. In
addition, a bedside technique applicable in the ICU
could be extremely useful for physicians to adjust the
optimal therapeutic/preventive modalities for kidney
perfusion in each patient.
In this context, a study in this issue of Critical Care pro￾vides useful important new information. Schneider and
colleagues [1] reported for the first time that contrast￾enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), a recent technique for
quantification of tissue perfusion and microcirculation, is
able to assess renal cortical perfusion in ICU patients be￾fore and after cardiac surgery. Schneider and colleagues
conclude that CEUS appears feasible and well tolerated.
In addition, CEUS derived-parameters suggest a decrease
in renal perfusion occurring within 24 hours of surgery in
patients at risk of AKI.
CEUS uses microbubble contrast agents, which are
composed of microbubbles of an injectable gas in a
supporting shell (phospholipids or proteins) [2-4]. Their
size (1 to 6 μm), similar to red blood cells, allows
microbubbles to cross the capillary bed of the pulmonary
circulation and to flow up to capillary level of the other
organs, enabling assessment of their microcirculation. At
the same time, their size is big enough that they do not
cross the endothelium, making them true intravascular
agents. Ultrasound waves induce a nonlinear oscillation of
microbubbles and the backscattered signal consequently
contains a range of frequencies in addition to that of the
incident ultrasound field with a high echogenicity differ￾ence between the gas in the microbubbles and the soft
tissue. The microbubbles can be injected as a bolus injec￾tion or as a constant infusion. When a constant infusion is
administered, as in the study of Schneider and colleagues
[1], a ‘destruction-replenishment’ mode is applied in
which higher power ultrasound pulses are used to destroy

the bubbles followed by low-power ultrasound pulses to
observe replenishment in the tissue. Signal-processing
techniques have been developed to separate echoes gener￾ated by microbubbles from those generated by tissue.
CEUS has been validated to assess tissue perfusion in
several organs. For example, CEUS has a high diagnostic
performance in the detection and characterization of
liver and renal tumors [5-7]. It allows the quantification
of myocardial blood flow in humans and provides the
basis for the noninvasive and quantitative assessment of
coronary artery disease [8]. Endoleaks after endovascular
aortic repair could be time- and cost-effectively detected
by CEUS [9]. In addition, CEUS demonstrates improved
diagnostic value compared to Doppler ultrasonography
for the detection of chronic allograft nephropathy after
renal transplantation [10].
Significant variations in quantitative CEUS results have
been described, however [3]. Several factors may induce
significant variability in quantitative CEUS - scanner set￾tings, patient factors (blood pressure, tissue motion), and
bubble types and handling. Thus, it is crucial to demon￾strate that CEUS could be an effective technique and a
clinically useful tool in ICU patients to assess organ perfu￾sion and the impact of our therapeutic strategies.
The study of Schneider and colleagues [1] is a first
step towards demonstrating the feasibility of CEUS to
assess cortical renal microcirculation in ICU patients.
Schneider and colleagues [1] demonstrated that this
technique is safe in ICU patients without deleterious
hemodynamic effects. Despite the fact that some pa￾tients were hemodynamically unstable with vasopressor
infusion, the authors were able to obtain adequate con￾trast enhancement for all patients at all time points.
Finally, the authors found an excellent correlation be￾tween readings for the perfusion index and the relative
blood volume. This last result highly suggests that the
analysis of video sequences is reproducible. However,
there is clearly important variability between basal values
and within each patient between each study time-point.
This might be due to individual differences and hetero￾geneities in cortical microcirculation but could also be
related to acquisition issues like scanner settings, place￾ment of the region of interest, and so on. Thus, it is
essential to take into account the variability of CEUS￾derived parameters between measurements in the same
patient at the same time-point. This point is critical to
confirm that the observed differences are higher than
potential differences due to the variability of acquisition
of CEUS-derived parameters.
The study of Schneider and colleagues opens up new
possibilities for the assessment of cortical renal microcir￾culation in ICU patients. Further studies are required to
confirm these results in a higher number of patients. Be￾ing able to quantify renal microcirculation is the first
step toward developing interventions that target micro￾circulatory perfusion and prevent AKI.
