Abstract
Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma is a rare vascular tumor,
described for the first time in 1975 by Dail and Liebow as an aggressive
bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma. The etiology is still a dilemma. Studies
about suggestive hypothesis are ongoing. Most of the times it affects
lung, liver and bones, although this kind of tumor may involve the head
and neck area, breast, lymph nodes, mediastinum, brain and
meninges, the spine, skin, abdomen and many other sites. Because of
its heterogeneous presentation, as it represents less than 1% of all the
vascular tumors, it is often misdiagnosed and not suitably treated,
leading to a poor prognosis in some cases. Over 50-76% of the patients
are asymptomatic. A small number of them complains respiratory
symptoms. Bone metastases might cause pathological fractures or
spine compression, if they arise in vertebrae. Imaging is necessary to
determine morphological data, the involvement of surrounding tis￾sues, and potentially the cleavage plan. It is important to recognize the
expression of vascular markers (Fli-1 and CD31 are endothelial-specif￾ic markers), and the microscopic evidence of vascular differentiation
to make a correct diagnosis, as many pulmonary diseases show multi￾ple nodular lesions. Because of its rarity, there is no standard for treat￾ment. We focused on radiotherapy as a good therapeutic option:
despite the poor prognosis, evidence is in favor of radiotherapy which
offers local pain control with good tolerance and better quality of life at
least at a one-year follow-up in most of cases. Further studies are
needed to establish the standard radiation dose to be used for locore￾gional control of such a complex and extremely rare disease.
Introduction
Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (EHE) is a rare vascular tumor
with an epithelioid and histiocytoid appearance, originating from vas￾cular endothelial or pre-endothelial cells. It represents less than 1% of
all vascular tumors and was described for the first time in 1975 by Dail
and Liebow as pulmonary EHE (P-EHE).1 Initially, it was believed to be
an aggressive form of bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma, invading adja￾cent blood vessels and small airways, hence the name intravascular
bronchioloalveolar tumor.
2-4
The term epithelioid hemangioendothelioma was introduced in 1982
by Weiss and Enzinger to describe a vascular tumor of bone and soft
tissue showing features between hemangioma and angiosarcoma.5,6
Corrin et al. demonstrated the presence of tumor cells deriving from a
lineage capable of differentiation along endothelial lines by using
immunohistochemical techniques.7 Later, Weldon-Linne et al. con￾firmed these findings using electron microscopy and revealed a diffuse
cytoplasmic staining of the malignant cells with a factor VIII-related
antigen.8
The recent World Health Organization (WHO 2002) classification
describes EHE as lesions that fall into the category of locally aggressive
tumors with metastatic potential.
9,10
The estimated prevalence of EHE is less than one in 1 million.11 Due
to its rarity, with only approximately 248 cases of P-EHE reported in the
current literature, few different groups have published large studies
(Amin 93 patients,12 Bagan 80 patients,13 Kitaichi 21 patients,14 Dail
20 patients4) (Table 1).12-36 Clinical registries such as the Armed
Forces Institute of Pathology Registry and the International
Hemangioendothelioma, Epithelioid Hemangioendothelioma and
Vascular Disorders Registry may help in following the natural history
of the disease.37
The majority of patients were females (male:female 1:4) in most of
the studies about P-EHE (Amin 73%, Bagan 65%, Kitaichi 62%, Dail
80%), while pleural EHE seems to be more frequent in males.38 This
malignant vascular tumor usually affects middle-aged patients,

although cases in children and elderly people have been described. The
age of the patients ranges from 7 to 83 years old.15,16 The median onset
is 36 years old, while the usual age at diagnosis is from 20 to 60 years
old.17
Etiopathogenesis
The etiology of EHE is still a dilemma. At the molecular level, different
angiogenic stimulators may act as promoters of endothelial cell prolifera￾tion.18 Recently it has been reported that monocyte chemo-attractant pro￾tein-1 is required for EHE proliferation and might promote the develop￾ment of these lesions by stimulating the angiogenic behavior of endothe￾lial cells.39 Budousquie et al. described several clonal abnormalities in
tumor cells: a complex unbalanced translocation between chromosomes 7
and 22 with multiple breakpoints, a robertsonian translocation of chromo￾some 14, and the loss of chromosome Y. 40 Monosomy for chromosome 11
and thetraploidy have also been detected in a subset of tumor cells. Errani
et al. focused on the t(1;3) (p36.3;q25) mutation: a molecular analysis
revealed that CAMTA1 on chromosome 1p36.23 and WWTR1 on chromo￾some 3q25 are the involved genes. Both genes had previously shown to
play important roles in oncogenesis, but it is the first time they are impli￾cated together in a recurrent chromosomal translocation, in EHE.
Particularly important is just the lack of CAMTA1 and WWTR1 rearrange￾ments in epithelioid hemangioma, a benign tumor that is often misdiag￾nosed as EHE.41 Recently, Antonescu et al. have found YAP1 rearrange￾ments in most of the transcription factor E3 (TFE3)-rearranged EHEs, and
this YAP1-TFE3 fusion subset occurs at the mean age of 30 years showing
at least focally, well-formed vascular features and a variably solid architec￾ture.42
A new, suggestive hypothesis of the pathogenesis of this disease
refers to a causal relationship between chronic Bartonella infection
and the development of this rare vascular tumor. The unique
Bartonella’s capability of invading and inducing long-lasting intraery￾throcytic and intraendothelial infections, together with the ability of at
least three Bartonella spp. (B. henselae, B. quintana, B. bacilliformis)
of inducing vascular endothelial growth factor-mediated vasoprolifera￾tion, as they upregulate mitogen and proinflammatory genes resulting
in cytoskeletal rearrangement and suppression of endothelial cell apop￾tosis, suggest that these bacterial pathogens might contribute to the
development of vascular tumors.43
Occurrence and metastasis
The Hemangioendothelioma, Epithelioid Hemangioendothelioma
And Related vascular Disorders (HEARD) Support Group observed that
the most common EHE presentations are liver alone (21%), liver plus
lung (18%), lung alone (12%) and bone alone (14%)11 (Figure 1).
However, EHE is a very heterogeneous tumor, and it has been reported
to involve many other sites44-56 (Table 2). When these cases occur, it
may be difficult to determine if the tumor is multicentric or if it is a pri￾mary lesion with metastases in other tissues, as EHE may originate in
either organ and metastasize to the other or it may have more than one
primary site. Sometimes we are able to distinguish metastases from a
multicentric primary tumor because of their less differentiation and
loss of the expression of epithelial markers.57
P-EHE dissemination may occur within blood vessels, lymphatics
and pleural cavity. The lung airspaces spread is continuous. Distant
hematogenous metastases have been reported mainly in the liver but
also in the skin, serosa, spleen, tonsils, retroperitoneum and kidney;
colonic metastases have also been described, but they are very rare.58
Bone metastases are doubtless the most frequent and the most clin￾ically severe. According to World Health Organization (WHO) classifi￾cation of Tumors of bone and soft tissues (2002), one half to two thirds
of them originates from a vessel (such as a small vein). Exceptionally
it may originate from a large vein or artery.59
Clinical aspects
The clinical aspects of P-EHE are summarized in Table 1. P-EHE is
often incidentally diagnosed and over 50-76% of patients are asympto￾matic, usually detected by abnormal chest radiography during health
examinations, or they have only minor, aspecific symptoms at the time
of the diagnosis. Otherwise, respiratory symptoms together with chest
pain or pleuritic pain are typical at P-EHE detection, even if few
patients may complain alveolar hemorrhage, hemoptysis and anemia,
occasionally clubbing and weight loss.12-14,20 Table 3 summarizes the
clinical aspects of EHE localized at other sites, different from lung: the
clinical presentation of this rare vascular tumor is as heterogeneous as
its clinical localization can be.2,10,47,49,51,53-58,60-69 In particular, when
bone metastases of EHE involve more than 50% of the cortex, there is
a serious risk for pathological fractures, and if they arise in vertebrae
they might cause spine compression and therefore paresthesia, loss of
muscular strength and paraplegia.57,60,61 Hemolytic anemia and con￾sumption coagulopathy have been rarely described. Usually, male P￾EHE patients tend to be detected more frequently by subjective symp￾toms (50%) than females (8%).11
Diagnostic tools
Laboratory data
Blood counts are usually normal. There is no effect on the total white
blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate or serum proteins, but
several values might abnormally increase if the liver is involved: white
blood cell count, serum alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotrans￾ferase, gammaglutamyl transferase, amylase and lipase.63 Chemistry
profiles and urinalyses are generally normal.
Radiological findings
The imaging evaluation of the EHE must be as complete as possible.
The radiology examination and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are
necessary to obtain morphological data: the degree of the neoforma￾tion, the relations with the surrounding tissues, a potential cleavage
plan.61

P-EHE radiologically appears as multiple perivascular nodules
with well-defined or blurred margins in both lungs, showing little
or no growth on serial chest radiographs or computed tomography
(CTs). The nodules may range in size up to 2 cm, but most are less
than 1 cm in diameter and are predominantly in the lower parts of
the lungs. They are usually found at small and medium sized ves￾sels and bronchi. Bilateral multiple nodular opacities are the most
common presentation: about 60% of cases display these changes,
even if P-EHE occasionally develops as a solitary, lung nodule,
measuring up to 5 cm (10-19% of cases13). Hilar lymph node
enlargement, lymph node metastases, interlobular septal thicken￾ing and pleural effusions can be also noticed, as well as unilateral
opacities and mosaic areas of ground-glass attenuations.
Radiologic calcification is not common but histologic examina￾tions often reveal calcified and ossified necrotic centers of the
nodules.29
Bone metastases appear as osteolytic lesions with homoge￾neous contrast enhancement on X-ray and CT scan, without
matrix mineralization; osseous expansile remodeling may be
seen, and joint invasion is also a common feature. These lesions
can be localized in the cortical or medullary bone: cortical disrup￾tion and extension into the soft tissue can be present, so soft tis￾sue swelling might be radiologically observed in this case.
Periosteal reaction is rare in the absence of pathologic fracture,
instead, as well as calcification. There is no specific pattern of sig￾nal intensity at MRI imaging. Most frequently EHE shows low to
intermediate signal intensity on T1-weighted images and high
signal intensity on T2-weighted images, together with homoge￾neous enhancement after the injection of contrast medium.60
Ultrasonography emphasizes the tumor’s vascularization and
allows differential diagnosis vis-à-vis an arteriovenous malforma￾tion or even an aneurysm.61
In some cases, positron emission tomography17 and bone
scintigraphy are used to evaluate lesions at other sites. Increased
uptake of F-fluorodeoxyglucose in this tumor has been recently
reported.70-72

 Review
Histological and cytological features
When EHE was identified, electron microscopy showed a typical
image of endothelial cells similar to those composing medium-size ves￾sels, or a large vein, arranging in nests or cords, while immunohisto￾chemistry revealed Weibel-Palade bodies in the cytoplasm of their cells
as a typical finding.64 Table 4 describes the typical macroscopical and
histolgical P-EHE appearance.73 Spindle-shaped tumor cells are occa￾sionally present. The cell growth may form lumens of various size
which occasionally contain red blood cells, that is the numerous dis￾tinct cytoplasmic vacuoles (ICLs) which may be observed under a
microscope. Sometimes the ICLs are so large that the nucleus is com￾pressed, and the cells present a signet-ring appearance.14,52 Some
smears have been reported to contain cells arranged as single cells and
pseudopapillary and pseudoglandular structures of varying size, or
complex branching cell groups with central stromal cores, as well as
cell aggregates lacking sharp anatomic borders or scalloped outlines. At
the nodule’s peripheral region the tumor cells extend to adjacent alve￾oli through the pores of Kohn, in the form of a micropolypoid growth
into the lumen of respiratory and membranous bronchioles. However,
the alveolar elastic framework is essentially preserved, as demonstrat￾ed by the presence of elastic tissue stains. The neoplastic tissues may
invade the walls and the lumens of small pulmonary arteries, veins and
lymphatic vessels. Inflammatory cellular infiltrate, congestion in the
adjacent lung parenchyma and fibrin thrombosis are usually not seen.
The Kitaichi’s study with a detailed biological description of the 21 P￾EHE patients analyzed and well categorized all these histopathological
features14 (Table 5).
Immunohistochemistry
A variety of endothelial proteins may be useful to identify EHE. The
Fli-1 protein is expressed by the endothelium as well as the T-cells and
megakaryocytes: this nuclear protein has proven useful in identifying
vascular neoplasm including EHE, showing a better combined sensitiv￾ity and specificity than the endothelial markers CD31 and CD34. CD34
is reported to be expressed by more than 90% of vascular tumors, so
this marker has poor specificity as a variety of soft tissue tumors also
express it. In contrast, CD31 is regarded as a relatively specific vascular
tumor marker. Some authors maintain that the combination of Fli-1
and CD31 represents an ideal panel for the differential diagnosis.74
Podoplanin is specifically expressed by lymphatic endothelial cells and
has been reported to be a useful diagnostic marker to identify EHE in
the liver. In addition, few cases of EHE show weak and focal positivity
for cytokeratin, so cytokeratin expression does not seem to be specific
for epithelial origin.74 Positive EMA and CD68 have been reported in
bone EHE,9 while a case of prostatic EHE showed positive p63 and PSA
plus weak patchy immunoreactivity for pankeratin (negative for
urothelial markers instead, as opposed to prostatic adenocarcinoma).55
In this regard, the endothelial marker ERG is worth a mention: this is
an ETS family transcription factor which is known to be expressed in
endothelial cells, whose oncogenic ERG gene fusions occur in subsets
of prostatic adenocarcinoma, acute myeloid leukemia and Ewing sarco￾ma. Miettinen et al. reported ERG to be expressed over the endothelia
of all of the hemangiomas, lymphangiomas and Kaposi sarcomas they
analyzed, 96% of angiosarcomas and 42 of the 43 cases of EHEs they
included in their study.75
Prognosis and death causes
The mean survival is 4.6 years, ranging from 6 months to 24
years.11,21,22

EHE is located in soft tissue, 35% when it affects the liver, and 65% if
it reaches the lung. According to the Kenneth Lau analysis, the 1-year￾overall survival (OS) is 90% (73% the 5-year-OS), while the 1- and 5-
year-OS after EHE progression is 53% and 24%, respectively (median
survival 1.3 years after disease progression).11,57 Asymptomatic P-EHE
patients have a median survival of 180 months. Some cases of partial
spontaneous regression were also reported in some asymptomatic
patients. The median onset is statistically worse in case of alveolar
hemorrhage, hemoptysis, hemorrhagic, pleural effusion, anemia
(OS<1 year according to the Bagan’s study).13 Patients with hilar
metastases or liver involvement were also reported to have a worse
prognosis, with an average survival of 2.2 years.17 EHE progresses on
average in 2 years (range 0.3-22.3 years), but the presence of metasta￾sis at the time of diagnosis does not necessarily correspond with
reduced survival. Nonetheless concomitant involvement of the skeleton
and viscera does not affect survival as long as it is localized and con￾fined. Only multi-organ involvement carries a clear survival disadvan￾tage. Conversely, we may consider the involvement of 3 or more bones
and ascites as poor prognostic factors.11 All this considered, we may
define the presence of pulmonary lesions, multi-organ involvement,
disease progression, age ≥55 years old, male patients as poor prognos￾tic factors. Patients complaining severe respiratory symptoms (dysp￾nea, cough, chest pain, hemoptysis and alveolar hemorrhage), weight
loss and anemia are also statistically worse, as well as those presenting
pleural invasion and pleural effusion on chest X-ray at detection, exten￾sive intravascular, endobronchial or intestinal tumor spread, hilar
metastases or liver involvement, peripheral lymphadenopathy, exten￾sive lymphangitic spread. Finally, histological finding as spindle tumor
cells, fibrinous pleuritic lesions or extrapleural tumor cells prolifera￾tion show a trend towards a worse prognosis.4,13,14,17,19,76
Most patients die from respiratory failure as a result of tumor nod￾ules increasing in size and number. In patients with bilateral disease,
those with radiologic findings of alveolar hemorrhage (interstitial
lesions, ground glasses opacities) and those with hemorrhagic effu￾sion, a rapid respiratory failure is usually the cause of death.13 A small
group succumbs because of extrapulmonary spread of tumor, with a
predominance of liver and bone disease.23
Differential diagnosis
There are many pulmonary diseases presenting with multiple nodu￾lar lesions, including hematogenous metastases, pulmonary arteriove￾nous malformations, granulomatous infections and granulomatous dis￾eases such as pulmonary hyalinizing granuloma, Wegener’s granulo￾matosis and sarcoidosis, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, pneumoconiosis,
multiple hematomas, amyloidosis, multiple calcifying fibrous tumors
(CFT).22 Also pneumocytoma, formerly known as sclerosing heman￾gioma of the lung, has to be differentiated from P-EHE: it is a benign
lung neoplasm and was described for the first time by Liebow and
Hubbel, showing an epithelial origin with dedifferentiation of type II
pneumocytes (hence the name pneumocytoma).77,78
Cytologic features, together with immunohistochemistry analysis
(especially the expression of vascular endothelial markers), allow to
differentiate them: negative Congo Red (different from amyloidosis),
non-specific inflammatory infiltration (granulomatous disease), dense
hyalinized collagenous tissue with psammomatous and lymphoplas￾macitic infiltrates (CFT).79 The histologic evaluation is also necessary
for differential diagnosis between EHE and other epithelioid tumors,
such as adenocarcinoma (whose cytoplasmic vacuoles do not contain
erythrocytes - positive for mucin stains, instead - as well as diffuse pos￾itivity for cytokeratin and epithelial membrane antigen); malignant
mesothelioma (showing little cytologic atypia, two-toned cytoplasm
known as fuzzy cytoplasmic borders, lack of cytoplasmic vacuoles, pos￾itivity for mesothelial markers such as calretinin, cytokeratin 5/6 or
WT-1); melanoma (with greater amounts of cytologic atypia and more
frequent mitoses, necrotic debris and melanin pigment, and expression
of S100 protein, MART-1, and other melanocytic markers); Epithelioid
angiosarcoma (presenting greater cellularity, larger cells, more promi￾nent mitotic activity, greater nuclear and nucleolar pleomorphism, and
more frequent tightly, cohesive cell clusters without myxohyaline
matrix, immunoreactivity for vimentin and cytokeratin); epithelioid
sarcoma (negative for vascular markers);52 meningioma (in case of
intracranial localization, negative for vascular markers and positive for
cytokeratin and S-100 protein).49 Sometimes EHE of bone needs to be
differentiated from chordoma, chondromyxoid fibroma and myxoid
chondrosarcoma, which are more voluminous and positive for S-100
protein.57
The presence of the aforementioned cytological features should
prompt correlation with clinical, radiologic and histologic features
(vascular differentiation), and immunochemical evaluation (vascular
markers expression) so as to ensure that the diagnosis is correct.80
Treatment options
Because of its rarity EHE has no standard for treatment, and actually
few therapeutic options are available. If the proposed association of
Bartonella spp. infections were confirmed, it would be plausible that
eradicating the bacterial infection or interrupting Bartonella-induced
angiogenic and proliferative cell signals could slow the tumor progres￾sion and improve patient outcomes.43

The available treatment options are mentioned in Tables 1 and 3.
When the lesions are small and limited in number, some authors rec￾ommend surgical resection or an preventive approach to asymptomatic
patients. Successful curative resection achieves good outcomes. The
role of adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy (RT) is
ambiguous, instead. Usually RT after surgical resection is chosen for
localized EHE, in order to control the residual disease given the recur￾rence of EHE, while chemotherapy is preferred in case of widespread
disease. However, their beneficial effect is still not confirmed.4,14,17,23,65
Lung
In patients with unilateral P-EHE nodules, wedge resection offers
the same survival outcomes as anatomic resection does. Hilar lymph
node resection should be systematically proposed, but the prognostic
value of lymph node invasion remains statistically unclear because of
the low number of patients with lymph node metastases.13 Conversely,
a complete surgical resection is usually impossible for pleural EHE.
Pinet et al. reported a case of an aggressive form of pleural EHE result￾ing in complete remission after treatment with carboplatin plus etopo￾side.65 In patients with bilateral nodules, partial or complete response
has been reported using interferon 2 (showing anti-angiogenic prop￾erties), and some partial spontaneous regression has also been
described.18 Corticosteroids, azathioprine, multiple wedge resections
or simple follow up are the other proposed treatment options. Multiple
chemotherapeutic regimens (MAID) have been tried, but no improve￾ment has been reported. Given its vascular origin, angiogenesis inhibi￾tion may be a reasonable approach for the management of metastatic
EHE. The available literature reported good tolerance and stabilization
of an aggressive, metastatic P-EHE using bevacizumab and nanoparti￾cle albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel): one partial response,
one stable disease (that was the only EHE of bone vs five P-EHE), and
four progression disease (PD) of six patients treated using bevacizum￾ab combined with MAID.24 In contrast, the use of thalidomide for non￾thoracic EHE led to two partial responses, one stable disease and two
PD of five treated patients, while using lenalidomide alone resulted in
stable disease at the 48-month follow up.24
Liver
Locally advanced hepatic EHE seems to benefit from transplantation,
with good results.63
Bone
Radical surgery is performed for resectable bone tumors, followed by
joint reconstruction. En-bloc resection is preferred in case of solitary
lesions; amputation is necessary for multicentric lesions. When a
pathological fracture occurs, temporary internal stabilization with a
plate and screws for pain control is chosen.66 A great alternative in the
last case is radiofrequency ablation: the aim is to create small thermal
injuries of bone carefully controlled, so that the extent of resection is
reduced with a better esthetic result as amputation can be avoided.67
Radiation therapy
This therapeutic option has proven to be ineffective for P-EHE
because of the tumor’s slow growth and consequently of its radiobiolog￾ical characteristics, while a good local control has been obtained in
EHE with exclusive bone presentation when RT was combined with
bone surgery, especially if the lesions are not surgically accessible.23,64
Since EHE has been correctly defined, there have been several
research groups dealing with EHE irradiation. A 4000 cGy for 4 weeks
protocol, and later a 3000 cGy course of RT towards the spine after sur￾gical removal of EHE of vertebrae have been described.23,64 The aim was
avoiding local recurrences: 1 case survived 11 years, the remaining
ones experienced a worsening due to multiple hepatic and abdominal
metastases. Thereafter, a 6400 cGy adjuvant RT was performed against
an axillary form of EHE, resulting in the absence of lymph nodes metas￾tases but pleural and pulmonary widespread.17 A local irradiation after
surgical resection of EHE of bone, based on 6000 cGy in 23 fractions for
43 days, showed a good tolerance of the treatment, either regional nor
distant metastases or local recurrence at 6, 12 and 24 month-follow￾up.61 A protocol of 33 fractions of RT, totaling 5940 cGy, was recently
applied to residual, postoperative mastoid: eight years after surgery
and adjuvant RT, imaging has demonstrated neither recurrence nor
changes in patient’s clinical exam.47 RT may be used above all in an
attempt to sclerose the blood vessels, in any case the use of radiation
must be carefully considered in the pediatric age, as RT increases the
risk of secondary sarcoma.68
Conclusions
Except for P-EHE, taking into account the extremely variable EHE
occurrence and its radiobiological characteristics, RT seems to carve
out a significant role in the treatment of such a complex and extremely
rare disease.
The available literature reveals no consensus about the radiation
dose to be used for the locoregional control of EHE: is this attributable
to the very small number of patients and to the limited survival that
EHE typically shows? Further studies are needed to answer the ques￾tion. Actually, no doubt evidence is all in favor of RT obtaining local
pain control with good tolerance and better quality of life at least at
one-year-follow up.
