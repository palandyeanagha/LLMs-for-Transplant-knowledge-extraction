Dietary oil composition differentially modulates
intestinal endotoxin transport and postprandial
endotoxemia
Venkatesh Mani1,2, James H Hollis3 and Nicholas K Gabler1,2*
Abstract
Background: Intestinal derived endotoxin and the subsequent endotoxemia can be considered major predisposing
factors for diseases such as atherosclerosis, sepsis, obesity and diabetes. Dietary fat has been shown to increase
postprandial endotoxemia. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the effects of different dietary oils on
intestinal endotoxin transport and postprandial endotoxemia using swine as a model. We hypothesized that oils
rich in saturated fatty acids (SFA) would augment, while oils rich in n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) would
attenuate intestinal endotoxin transport and circulating concentrations.
Methods: Postprandial endotoxemia was measured in twenty four pigs following a porridge meal made with
either water (Control), fish oil (FO), vegetable oil (VO) or coconut oil (CO). Blood was collected at 0, 1, 2, 3 and
5 hours postprandial and measured for endotoxin. Furthermore, ex vivo ileum endotoxin transport was assessed
using modified Ussing chambers and intestines were treated with either no oil or 12.5% (v/v) VO, FO, cod liver oil
(CLO), CO or olive oil (OO). Ex vivo mucosal to serosal endotoxin transport permeability (Papp) was then measured
by the addition of fluorescent labeled-lipopolysaccharide.
Results: Postprandial serum endotoxin concentrations were increased after a meal rich in saturated fatty acids and
decreased with higher n-3 PUFA intake. Compared to the no oil control, fish oil and CLO which are rich in n-3 fatty
acids reduced ex vivo endotoxin Papp by 50% (P < 0.05). Contrarily, saturated fatty acids increased the Papp by 60%
(P = 0.008). Olive and vegetable oils did not alter intestinal endotoxin Papp.
Conclusion: Overall, these results indicate that saturated and n-3 PUFA differentially regulate intestinal epithelial
endotoxin transport. This may be associated with fatty acid regulation of intestinal membrane lipid raft mediated
permeability.

Background
The link between dietary fat and endogenous blood
endotoxin has attracted increased medical and biomed￾ical interest over the last few years. Furthermore, hyper￾phagia, increased adiposity and metabolic changes
associated with high fat feeding can be recapitulated in
mice chronically infused with LPS for four weeks [1]. It
has been reported that the structure of fat consumed
(emulsion vs. free oil) changes the extent of endotoxemia
and that altering the composition, structure and quality of
dietary fats could improve health [2]. In healthy humans,
postprandial plasma endotoxin concentrations increase
on average 18% after a high fat meal (approximately
380 kcal from fat, 42% of total energy) compared to the
fasted state [3]. These authors concluded that increased
postprandial LPS may contribute to the development of
postprandial inflammation and disease. Ghanim et al.
[4,5] also showed that in healthy adults, high fat, high
carbohydrate meal (~900 kcal) increased postprandial
plasma LPS concentrations by 70%. However, Laugerette
et al. [6] recently reported that dietary oil composition dif￾ferentially modulated murine inflammation and endotoxin

transport. These authors also showed that fat compos￾ition, not quantity in the diet (22 vs. 3%) was critical in
modulating plasma endotoxemia. Collectively, these data
show that dietary fat intake and composition is able to
modulate blood endotoxin and that this is associated with
acute inflammation and the metabolic diseases of obesity
and diabetes.
Both gram positive and gram negative bacteria are
present in large quantities in the intestine. Interestingly,
the total quantity of endotoxin, which is the gram nega￾tive bacterial outer cell wall component, in the intestine
alone could be up to one gram [7]. Even very small quan￾tities of endotoxin, pico-gram scale, in the systemic circu￾lation has the potential to elicit an inflammatory response
in humans and animals [8]. Endotoxin is also synonym￾ously referred to as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and both of
these compounds are major immunogens that elicit an in￾flammatory response in numerous tissues and cell types
via their recognition through pathogen-associated mo￾lecular patterns (PAMPs) and Toll like receptors in the
innate immune system [9]. Endotoxin is thought to enter
circulation by transport across the intestinal epithelium
either via paracellular pathways through the openings of
intestinal tight junctions between two epithelial cells or
by a transcellular pathway [7]. Transcellular transport and
the associated endocytosis of intestinal derived endotoxin
may be facilitated by intracellular signaling processes
mediated by the innate immune receptor complex CD
14/Toll like receptor 4 (TLR4)/MD-2, in association with
the cell membrane micro domain lipid raft [10]. Further￾more, circulating endotoxin concentrations may also be
augmented by transport coupled to dietary lipids and chy￾lomicrons [11].
In recent years accumulating research has investigated
the link between dietary fat and endogenous endotoxin
in relation to metabolic inflammation [12,13]. Current
evidence suggests that dietary fat augments circulating
endotoxin concentrations and the resultant postprandial
endotoxemia leads to low-grade systemic inflammation
which has been implicated in the development of several
metabolic diseases [1,3,14]. Intestinal derived endotoxin
and the subsequent acute endotoxemia are considered
major predisposing factors for inflammation associated
diseases such as atherosclerosis, sepsis, obesity, type 2
diabetes and Alzheimer's [15-17]. However, the ability of
different types of oil and fatty acids to facilitate uptake
of intestinal endotoxin has been poorly characterized.
Interestingly, saturated and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty
acids (PUFA) have been shown to reciprocally modulate
the LPS receptor, TLR4, and cell membrane lipid rafts
[18]. This is postulated to be due to saturated fatty acids
(SFA) such as lauric and myristic acid being part of the
fatty acyl side chain composition of Lipid-A component
of endotoxin and the ability of n-3 PUFA to reduce the
potency of endotoxin when substituted in place of satu￾rated fatty acids in lipid-A [19,20]. Thus, there is clear
linkage between fatty acids (saturated, n-3 polyunsatur￾ated, monounsaturated etc. ...) and endotoxin signaling.
Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the
effects of various dietary fats on in vivo and ex vivo in￾testinal endotoxin transport and circulating concen
trations using the pig as a biomedical model. We
hypothesize that oils rich in saturated fatty acids (SFA)
would augment, while the oils containing the n-3 PUFA
(docosahexaenoic acid [DHA] and eicosapentaenoic acid
[EPA]) would attenuate, intestinal endotoxin transport
and postprandial endotoxemia.

Effect of dietary oil on postprandial serum
endotoxin concentration
Twenty four pigs (49 ± 7 kg BW) were raised on a typical
corn-soybean diet that met or exceeded their nutrient
requirements [21] and randomly allocated to one of four
treatments. The treatments consisted of 500 g ground
corn-soybean meal dough (2,145 kcal ME) made up with
either 1) 50 ml water (Control); 2) 50 ml fish oil (FO)
(Spring Valley Inc., UT); 3) 50 ml vegetable oil (VO)
(Hy-Vee Inc., IA) ; or 4) 50 ml coconut oil (CO)
(Spectrum Naturals Inc., NY). After an overnight fast,
six pigs were fed one of each porridge meal. Pigs volun￾tarily consumed the entire porridge meal with in ten
minutes after the meal was offered. Blood was collected
at 0, 1, 2, 3, and 5 hours postprandial by venipuncture
using pyrogen free vaccutainer tubes and sterile needles.
Proper precautionary measures were taken to prevent
external endotoxin contamination of blood. Serum was
separated by centrifuging at 2000 × g and 4°C. Serum
was then stored in pyrogen free tubes at −80°C until fur￾ther analysis.
Circulating serum endotoxin concentration was mea￾sured using the end point fluorescent assay using the re￾combinant factor C (rFC) system (Lonza™
, Switzerland).
Briefly, the serum samples were diluted 1000 times and
100 μl of the samples or standards were added to a 96
well plate and incubated at 37°C for 10 min. Thereafter,
100 μL of rFC enzyme, rFC assay buffer and rFC substrate
were added at a ratio of 1:4:5 to the plate and an initial
reading were taken followed by 1 h incubation at 37°C.
The relative fluorescence unit (RFU) for each well was
determined (excitation 380 nm and emission 440 nm). A

positive control standard from the assay kit was used to
ascertain the validity of the assay and the concentration
of the endotoxin was interpolated from the standard
curve constructed from the standards and corrected for
sample dilution.
Ex vivo intestinal integrity and endotoxin transport
Freshly isolated ileum segments from eleven pigs (21–
28 days old) were placed in chilled Krebs-Henseleit buffer
(consisting of, in mmol/L: 25 NaHCO3, 120 NaCl, 1
MgSO4, 6.3 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 0.32 NaH2PO4; pH 7.4) for
transport to the laboratory while under constant aeration.
Intestinal tissues were then stripped of their outer serosal
layer and immediately mounted into modified Ussing
chambers (Physiologic Instruments Inc., San Diego, CA
and World Precision Instruments Inc. New Haven, CT).
Each chamber and intestinal segment (0.71 cm2
) was
bathed on its mucosal and serosal sides with 5 ml of
Krebs-Henseleit buffer and constantly gassed with 95%
O2-5% CO2 mixture. Chambers were connected to a pair
of dual channel current and voltage electrodes containing
3% noble agar bridges and filled with 3 M potassium
chloride to measure electrophysiological parameters of the
intestinal membranes or to measure the mucosal to se￾rosal transport of endotoxin. Transepithelial resistance
(TER) was not different across pigs, indicating no differ￾ences in paracellular permeability or leaky gut (data not
shown).
To rule out any influence that bile acids may have on
intestinal integrity, TER and macromolecule permeabil￾ity was first tested on isolated ileum samples that were
incubated with porcine bile acid (0, 3, 6 and 9 mg/ml)
for thirty minutes. Thereafter, FITC-labeled dextran
(FITC-Dextran, 4.4 kDa) mucosal to serosal transport
was measured as described previously [22]. Briefly, the
mucosal chambers were challenged with 2.2 mg/mL
FITC-Dextran and chamber samples from both sides
were collected every 10–15 min for eighty minutes. The
relative fluorescence was then determined using a fluor￾escent plate reader (Bio-Tek, USA) with the excitation
and emission wavelengths of 485 and 520 nm, respect￾ively. Thereafter, an apparent permeability coefficient
(Papp) was calculated for each treatment:
Papp ¼ dQ
ð Þ dt  A  C0
Where: dQ/dt = transport rate (μg/min); C0 = initial
concentration in the donor chamber (μg/ml); A = area of
the membrane (cm2
).
The effect of dietary fat on endotoxin transport was
studied using ex vivo permeability of fluorescein isothio￾cyanate (FITC) labeled-LPS (Escherichia coli 055:B5)
mounted into modified Ussing chambers. Briefly, segments
of swine intestinal tissues were treated with either 12.5%
(v/v) buffered saline control (CON), Fish Oil or cod liver
oil (CLO) manufactured by Spring Valley Inc., UT) or
vegetable oil, coconut oil or olive oil (OO) purchased form
Hy-Vee Supermarkets Inc., IA). All oils were commercial
retail available and then mixed with 20 mM sodium tauro￾deoxycholate (bile acid) for micelle formation to simulate
the intestinal milieu. Each mucosal chamber was then
challenged with 20 μg/mL FITC-LPS and chamber sam￾ples were collected every 10–15 min for eighty minutes.
The relative fluorescence of each sample was then deter￾mined using a fluorescent plate reader (Bio-Tek, USA)
with the excitation and emission wavelengths of 485 and
520 nm, respectively. The apparent permeability coeffi￾cient was then calculated similar to that described above
for FITC-Dextran.
Lipid rafts, dietary oil and ex vivo intestinal
endotoxin transport
To examine the role of lipid rafts in intestinal endotoxin
transport, ileum segments from 16 pigs (56 ± 4 days of
age) were mounted in Ussing chambers as described
above. Segments were pre-treated with or without 25 mM
Methyl-β-cyclo dextrin (MβCD, a synthetic lipid raft
modifier) for 30 min. Thereafter, the mucosal chamber
was spiked with either saline-bile acid (CON) or Coconut
oil-bile acid (12.5% v/v) and the FITC-LPS apparent per￾meability coefficient for each tissue was calculated.
Fatty acid analysis
Fatty acid profiles of the dietary oils used to make the
porridge were determined and analyzed by GC-MS
[23,24]. One ml oil was mixed with 0.5 mL of 4:1 hexane
and 125 μg/L heptadecanoic acid was added to each
sample as an internal standard. FAME were analyzed by
GC on a Hewlett-Packard model 6890 fitted with an
Omegawax 320 (30-m × 0.32-mm i.id. 0.25 um) capillary
column. Hydrogen was the carrier gas. The temperature
program ranged from 80 to 250°C with a temperature
rise of 5°C/min. The injector and detector temperatures
were 250°C and 1 μL of sample was injected and run
split. Fatty acids methyl esters were identified by their
relative retention times on the column with respect to
appropriate standards and heptadecanoic acid.
Data analysis
Results are presented as means ± S.E.M and were analyzed
with the Proc Mixed procedure of SAS (Cary, NC). In the
model, repetition or day of Ussing chamber run was used
as a random effect. Statistical significance of difference
was analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed
by Tukey’s range test for pair wise comparison of all treat￾ment means. Differences were considered significant at
P ≤ 0.05 and a tendency at P ≤ 0.10.

Results
Dietary oil fatty acid profiles
The fatty acid composition of the oils used to make the
porridge meal and/or in the ex vivo transport study are
reported in Table 1. The coconut oil contained high con￾centrations of saturated fatty acids (89%), particularly lau￾ric, myristic, palmitic acids. Olive oil contained a very
high content of monounsaturated oleic acid and a moder￾ate amount of palmitic acid, with a saturated fat content
of 29%. Vegetable oil used in this study contained a high
quantity (50%) of arachidonic acid (20:4n6), 32% oleic
acid and 13% palmitic acid. The fish oil used consisted of
35% docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and 19% eicosapenta￾enoic acid (EPA), while the cod liver oil contained 32%
palmitic acid, 25% arachidonic acid, 8.6% EPA and 4.3%
DHA. The n6:n3 ratio was highest in the olive oil > vege￾table oil > cod liver oil > fish oil > coconut oil.
Effect of dietary oil on postprandial serum
endotoxin concentration
To assess the effect of dietary lipids on postprandial
serum endotoxin concentrations, pigs received a por￾ridge meal containing either 50 mL of saline, CO, VO or
FO. The endotoxin concentration of the various oils
used did not differ (data not shown). Change in post￾prandial serum endotoxin concentration due to different
meal treatments are presented in Figure 1A. The overall
postprandial serum endotoxin concentrations were sig￾nificantly lower in the meals constituting saline or FO,
with the mean overall serum endotoxin concentration in￾creasing two-fold over the saturated coconut oil meal
treatment (P < 0.05, Figure 1B). However, meals made up
with VO were not different from the saline, CO or FO
treatments (P < 0.05). Interestingly, the CO meal signifi￾cantly elevated serum endotoxin concentrations after
2 hours versus the saline and FO, and these remained ele￾vated at 3 and 5 hour postprandial (P < 0.05, Figure 1A).
Effect of exogenous porcine bile acid on ex vivo
intestinal integrity
Bile acids have been shown to increase the intestinal
permeability in cultured Caco-2 cell lines [25]. To rule
out the effect that exogenous bile acid may reduce intes￾tinal integrity, freshly isolated pig ileum segments were
used to measure TER (Figure 2A) and FITC-Dextran
permeability (Figure 2B). As these segments were
exposed to increasing concentrations of porcine bile
ex vivo, no differences in intestinal integrity were
observed (P > 0.10, Figure 2). This might be due to the
tolerance of intestinal tissues towards bile acid because
of previous exposure in vivo contrary to cell cultures
where the cells are not exposed to the bile acids
previously.

Effect of dietary oil on ex vivo intestinal
endotoxin transport
The ex vivo mucosal to serosal ileum endotoxin transport
was assessed using modified Ussing chambers and FITC￾LPS permeability assay (Figure 3). Compared to the saline
no oil control treatment, the endotoxin Papp was signifi￾cantly lower in both the FO and CLO treatments (P <
0.05). As hypothesized, the higher saturated fat content of
coconut oil significantly increased the endotoxin Papp
compared to the saline, FO and CLO (P < 0.05). However,
mucosal treatment with VO and OO did not differ from
the saline or n-3 treatments (P > 0.05), but still attenuated
endotoxin Papp versus the coconut oil treatment (P <
0.05, Figure 3). Transepithelial resistance was not differ￾ent due to ex vivo oil treatment (data not shown).
Effect of lipid raft modification on saturated fat induced
endotoxin transport
To test the hypothesis that destabilization of intestinal
lipid rafts would decrease saturated fat induced endotoxin
permeability, ileum samples were pretreated with the lipid
raft modifier methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) and coconut
oil ex vivo. FITC-LPS endotoxin transport permeability
was then measured (Figure 4A). As expected, the CO
treatment significantly augmented the ileum endotoxin
Papp compared to the saline control (P < 0.05). However,
the endotoxin Papp was significantly reduced with the
MβCD treatment compared to the saline control (1.54 vs.
0.07, P = 0.04). In the presence of MβCD and CO, the
ileum Papp was attenuated three fold from the CO alone
treatment (P < 0.05). Importantly, ileum integrity and per￾meability as measured by transepithelial resistance was
not altered by either short term coconut oil, MβCD, or
the combination compared to the saline control (P = 0.98,
Figure 4B).

Discussion
In Western diets, vegetable, canola and palm oils are
common components of the diet and to a lesser extent,
long chain n-3 PUFA (DHA and EPA) oils from algal or
marine sources [26,27]. In recent years, the development
of obesity, inflammation, atherosclerosis and other meta￾bolic diseases has been linked to low grade endotoxemia
associated with high dietary fat and energy intake
[3,14,28-30]. However, these studies and others have
raised questions on whether this diet induced endotoxe￾mia reflects changes in energy and fat content of the
diet, intestinal permeability or diet induced changes in
gut microbiota. In the current study, we used ex vivo
and in vivo methods to examine intestinal permeability
to endotoxin as it relates to dietary oil composition. All
pigs were clinically healthy and raised on typical com￾mercial swine corn-soybean diets. We observed no dif￾ferences in intestinal integrity due to our ex vivo
treatments. Even though some cell culture experiments
have been shown to indicate bile acids affecting the in￾testinal permeability, we didn’t observe any negative
impacts from bile acids on intestinal integrity and per￾meability. Further, Lang et al. reported that bile alone
may not be sufficient to induce barrier function in the
Ex-vivo experiments [31]. Importantly, we only exam￾ined the acute actions of a meal or oil bolus treatment
and did not conduct a prolonged feeding trial in an at￾tempt to change the pig microbiota populations or the
fatty acid profiles of tissues due to diet.
We hypothesized that dietary intake of oils rich in DHA
and EPA would attenuate intestinal endotoxin transport
and postprandial circulating endotoxin. We found that
dietary cod liver and fish oils attenuated serum endotoxin
concentrations compared to the coconut oil and the

endotoxin levels in these pigs were similar to the control
group (Figure 1). To the best of our knowledge, there are
no other studies that have shown this effect of DHA and
EPA on endotoxin transport and blood endotoxemia.
Interestingly, only one paper has examined the effects
of dietary oil composition on endotoxin uptake and
related inflammation [6]. However, contrary to our
results, the report by Laugerette et al. [6] states that rape
seed (canola) and sunflower oil, with its high unsatur￾ated fatty acid content, augmented plasma endotoxemia
by 50-75%. Cani et al. [1], also observed a similar in￾crease in endotoxemia in mice orally administered corn
oil with or without LPS compared to water alone. How￾ever, we observed no change in serum postprandial
endotoxin concentration or intestinal endotoxin trans￾port due to dietary vegetable oil compared to the saline
control (Figures 1 and 3). This discrepancy of these
parameters between the studies might be partially
explained by the use of different animal models and also
the nature of the experimental design. Whereas Lauger￾ette et al. [6] performed a chronic feeding study using
mice for eight weeks using oils with different fatty acid
composition; we used an acute meal bolus model with
swine to examine endotoxin permeability. Therefore, the
mice fatty acid profiles would have mimicked their diets
and this tissue enrichment may also modify endotoxin
permeability, signaling and acute inflammation. Further
work is needed to explain the molecular aspects of these
differences between the two studies with regard to acute
versus chronic dietary fat signaling in the gastrointes￾tinal tract. Additionally, we observed a significant in￾crease in postprandial endotoxemia after a porridge
meal mixed with coconut oil (Figure 1). Again, this con￾tradicts data presented by Laugerette et al. [6] in which
palm oil, high in saturated fatty acids, had no effect on
plasma endotoxin concentrations in mice. However, these
authors did report an increase in plasma LPS binding pro￾tein and argued that this protein is a better marker of
endotoxemia due to the short half-life of circulating endo￾toxin. One issue is that LPS binding protein can be up
regulated by inflammation and acute stress as well as both
gram positive and negative infections. As the magnitude
of LBP response goes down with multiple episodes of in￾fection [32], this could be a result of the agonistic effects
of saturated fatty acid on pro-inflammatory signaling and
not circulating endotoxin.
Gram negative bacteria, particularly those found in the
distal ileum and colon, might be one of the major sources
for circulating endotoxin [33]. It has been estimated that
a single cell of Escherichia coli contains approximately
106 Lipid A or endotoxin molecules and a typical human
intestinal tract could harbor approximately one gram of
endotoxin [33-35]. Interestingly, the bacterial population
in the intestine is not static. Multiple studies have shown
that bacterial composition shifts to either gram positive
majority or gram negative majority based on the compos￾ition of the diet consumed [30,36,37]. A majority of these
studies show that consuming high saturated fat diet for a
longer period results in higher gram negative bacterial
populations and high fiber diets results in gram positive
bacterial populations [30,38]. Laugerette et al. [6], reaf￾firmed this and showed that fatty acid composition
of different dietary oils can alter intestinal microbiota
populations. Moreover, these authors demonstrated that
feeding a diet high in palm oil which is rich in SFAs sig￾nificantly increased the gram negative bacteria Escherichia
coli groups, which can be significant source of endotoxin
in the cecal content of mice compared to milk fat, rape
seed and sunflower oil fed diets.
During intestinal stress, ischemia, inflammation and
diseases, paracellular transport occurs through the tight
junction, as known as “leaky gut” [39]. Alternatively,
transcellular or intracellular transport can occur, particu￾larly in healthy individuals [40]. Transcellular endotoxin
transported across a cell membrane has been shown to
occur via TLR4 and soluble GPI anchored receptor CD14
in a lipid raft mediated mechanism [41,42]. Additionally,
chylomicron associated LPS transport has also been sug￾gested to play a key role in intestinal LPS transport from
the intestinal epithelial cell [11,43,44]. Importantly, we
observed no decrease in intestinal integrity which might
enhance paracellular permeability as assessed by transe￾pithelial resistance or FITC-dextran permeability due to
treatment or short term raft destabilization (Figure 4B).
These data suggest that under healthy intestinal epithelial
conditions, endotoxin is most likely transported via lipid
raft mediated endocytosis.
The signaling and transport process for endotoxin is
initiated in specialized membrane micro domains called
lipid rafts [42]. Lipid rafts are membrane regions rich in
cholesterol, glycolipids, sphingolipids and saturated fatty
acids, which result in a ‘rigid’ membrane structure com￾pared to the adjacent ‘fluid’ regions [45]. In immune
cells, endotoxin triggers the recruitment of TLR4 into
the lipid raft, where it interacts with CD14 and other
associated proteins such as MD-2 resulting in an inflam￾matory signaling cascade [46,47]. Thus, the two major
consequences of preventing endotoxin recognition by
dissociating the lipid raft to attenuate TLR4 recruitment
include reduced inflammatory signaling and attenuated
endotoxin transport. We observed that if intestinal lipid
rafts are dissociated ex vivo with MβCD, then endotoxin
permeability is attenuated in the ileum (Figure 4). Inter￾estingly, saturated fat induced endotoxin permeability is
also significantly reduced. Stimulation of TLR4 receptor
has been shown to result in the endotoxin transport
across the intestinal epithelial cells [40]. TLR4 is not
only implicated in the transcellular transport of LPS but

also for live bacteria [48]. Since saturated fatty acids and
n-3 PUFA can reciprocally modulate TLR4 signaling
[49], the fatty acid composition of oil in the diet has the
potential to increase or decrease endotoxin transport.
Altogether, these data suggest that apical endotoxin
transport in the intestines is arguably raft mediated in
healthy individuals.
In vitro experiments show clearly that n-3 PUFA dis￾rupt TLR4 signalling and the activation of NFκB by LPS
in a murine monocytic cell line [50]. Moreover, DHA
modulates TLR4 signaling in vitro in RAW 264.7 macro￾phages and 293 T cells [49], human monocytes and den￾dritic cells [51] and adipose tissue. We have previously
shown in pigs that dietary EPA and DHA are effective
means of influencing the inflammatory status and path￾ways influenced by TLR4 signaling induced by LPS [52]
and in altering intestinal function [24,53]. Therefore, one
could postulate that antagonizing TLR4 recruitment to
lipid rafts and it’s signaling by DHA and EPA, or stimu￾lating these processes with saturated fatty acids, would
alter endotoxin transport and circulating postprandial
endotoxin.
Another mechanism through which endotoxin can
enter the circulation is through micelles. Since the endo￾toxin side chains are made up of fatty acids, endotoxins
can be incorporated into the micelles and transported
into the intestinal epithelial cell [54]. In intestinal epithe￾lial cells, chylomicrons transport the absorbed lipids into
various parts of the body. High fat administration has
been shown to proportionately increase the endotoxin
content of the chylomicron indicating that high fat con￾sumption indeed enhances higher endotoxin transport
into the intestinal epithelial cell and incorporation into
chylomicron [11,28]. Furthermore, even though the
mechanism is not clear, high intake of fat has been
shown to cause internalization of tight junction proteins
and increase in the paracellular permeability to macro
molecules including endotoxin [30]. Even though, this
mode of endotoxin transport cannot be ruled out, we
speculate that the rate of incorporation of fatty acids
into micelles would not vary due to oil composition.
Therefore, we propose that the difference in intestinal
endotoxin transport we observed is primarily transcellu￾lar transport that involves lipid rafts and receptor
mediated endocytosis [42].
In conclusion, these data suggest that dietary oils can
differentially alter intestinal endotoxin transport. Oils
rich in DHA and EPA attenuate endotoxin transport,
while oils high in saturated fatty acids augment endo￾toxin transport. Furthermore, intestinal endotoxin trans￾port in healthy subjects may be regulated through a lipid
raft mediated mechanism. Saturated fatty acids may be
stabilizing the lipid rafts allowing for greater endotoxin
transport.
