Abstract
Background: This study describes the natural history of Barth syndrome (BTHS).
Methods: The medical records of all patients with BTHS living in France were identified in multiple sources and
reviewed.
Results: We identified 16 BTHS pedigrees that included 22 patients. TAZ mutations were observed in 15 pedigrees.
The estimated incidence of BTHS was 1.5 cases per million births (95%CI: 0.2–2.3). The median age at presentation
was 3.1 weeks (range, 0–1.4 years), and the median age at last follow-up was 4.75 years (range, 3–15 years). Eleven
patients died at a median age of 5.1 months; 9 deaths were related to cardiomyopathy and 2 to sepsis. The 5-year
survival rate was 51%, and no deaths were observed in patients ≥3 years. Fourteen patients presented with
cardiomyopathy, and cardiomyopathy was documented in 20 during follow-up. Left ventricular systolic function
was very poor during the first year of life and tended to normalize over time. Nineteen patients had neutropenia.
Metabolic investigations revealed inconstant moderate 3-methylglutaconic aciduria and plasma arginine levels that
were reduced or in the low-normal range. Survival correlated with two prognostic factors: severe neutropenia at
diagnosis (<0.5 × 109
/L) and birth year. Specifically, the survival rate was 70% for patients born after 2000 and 20%
for those born before 2000.
Conclusions: This survey found that BTHS outcome was affected by cardiac events and by a risk of infection that
was related to neutropenia. Modern management of heart failure and prevention of infection in infancy may
improve the survival of patients with BTHS without the need for heart transplantation.

Background
Barth syndrome (BTHS; MIM 302060) is a recessive X￾linked mitochondrial disorder first described by Barth
et al. in 1983 in a large pedigree of Dutch patients [1].
This syndrome is characterized by cardiomyopathy,
neutropenia, skeletal myopathy and growth delay. While
clinical symptoms are usually present early in infancy
[2], the age at presentation and the features of BTHS
vary significantly among patients [3]. BTHS is caused by
mutations in the TAZ gene, located in Xq28 [4]. This
gene encodes the Tafazzin protein, which is involved in
the remodelling of cardiolipin, an essential component
of the mitochondrial inner membrane that is necessary
for proper function of the respiratory chain [5,6]. No
genotype-phenotype correlation has been described to
date [7]. Currently, there are 151 recorded cases of
BTHS worldwide [8] and several surveys have been
published in the last 10 years. The largest one analysed
the growth and cardiac outcome of 73 patients, extending
the observations in previous studies [9,10] and Additional
file 1: Table S1 offers a review of all available surveys
[1,2,9-18]. Clinical heterogeneity, the rarity of the syndrome
and a lack of data regarding the epidemiology and natural

history of BTHS prompted us to conduct a national study
in France to analyse clinical and biological features of the
disease as well as disease outcomes.
Design and methods
Patients
This was an observational longitudinal retrospective
study. The study included all French patients diagnosed
with BTHS between January 1, 1983 and August 1, 2012.
A diagnosis of BTHS was suspected when cardiomyop￾athy and neutropenia were present and BTHS was
confirmed by identification of a mutation in the TAZ
gene or when i) the patient was a male with clinical
signs of BTHS and had an informative cardiolipin profile
[19] or ii) the patient was a male maternal relative of a
confirmed BTHS patient with a TAZ mutation who
presented with clinical signs of BTHS. To ensure that
our enrolment was as complete as possible i.e. that we
included all BTHS cases in France, patients were
recruited from several sources. First we identified all
cases that were already registered in the French severe
chronic neutropenia registry. Then we contacted all
paediatricians who belonged to the French Society of
Paediatric Haematology and Immunology, all French
paediatric cardiologists in the French Society of Con￾genital and Paediatric Cardiology and all genetics labora￾tories that perform the analysis of the TAZ gene. We
asked these sources to identify their patients with known
BTHS or patients who presented with dilated cardiomy￾opathy and neutropenia. Patients with an informative
cardiolipin profile were recruited from the Biochemistry
Laboratory at the Necker Enfants Malades Hospital. The
French Patients and Parents Association was solicited to
complete the enrolment. Finally, the national database
of death certificates (www.cepidc.vesinet.inserm.fr) was
checked in order to identify patients whose immediate
or underlying cause of death was Barth syndrome. Once
a case was identified, the patient was included in the
registry, and data were collected from the patient’s
medical charts. All patients and/or their parents gave
written informed consent for inclusion in the registry.
Clinical investigations
The following data were systematically extracted from
the patients’ files: demographic and physical characteris￾tics, cardiac evaluations, haematological parameters,
gross motor delays, medications, genotype and need for
nutritional support. Laboratory evaluations such as
cardiolipin profiles and urinary organic acid and plasma
amino acid profiles were also recorded. Prematurity was
defined as gestational age less than 37 weeks. Patients
were considered to have severe intrauterine growth
retardation (IUGR) if the birth weight was below the 3rd
percentile for the gestational age. Age at presentation
was defined by the age at which the first pathological
manifestations were noted that led to the diagnosis
of BTHS.
Cardiac evaluation and definitions
We collected all available echocardiogram records for
each patient. The echocardiogram performed at the time
of diagnosis was considered to be the first echocardio￾gram at the age of diagnosis. The left ventricular end
diastolic diameter (LVEDD) and the left ventricular mass
(LV mass) were analysed according to age and body
surface area, and z-scores were calculated according to
standard distribution [20]. The left ventricular ejection
fraction (LVEF) was also recorded. Dilated cardiomyop￾athy (DCM) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)
were defined by LVEDD and by LV mass z-score greater
than +2 standard deviations (SD), respectively. Informa￾tion about hospitalisation for heart failure, therapy for
heart failure (including the use of mechanical ventila￾tion), inotropic drugs, heart transplantation and cause of
death were recorded. Electrocardiograms (ECG) and
24-hour ECG/Holter monitor records were also collected.
The corrected QT interval (QTc) was calculated using
Bazett’s formula.
Haematological definitions and neutropenia-related
complications
The first complete blood count (CBC) performed for the
patient was considered the initial CBC. Baseline CBCs were
considered if they were collected during routine consulta￾tions, with the exception of periods in which granulocyte￾stimulating factor (GCSF) therapy was given. Neutropenia
was defined by an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) below
1.5 × 109
/L, and severe neutropenia was defined by an
ANC below 0.5 × 109
/L. The results of bone marrow
smears were reviewed to look for myeloid arrest, which was
defined as in previous studies [21].
Severe infections were defined as those that would be
life-threatening without appropriate antibiotic or anti￾fungal therapy and that required medical supervision or
hospitalisation. These events were exhaustively recorded
in the patients’ medical records. Minor infections were
stomatological infections, ear, nose and throat (ENT)
infections, or bronchitis.
Metabolic investigations
Cardiolipin analysis was performed using standard liquid
chromatography and mass spectrometry according to a
published method [19]. Urine organic acids and plasma
amino acids were investigated by GC-MS and HPLC￾ninhydrin colorimetry, respectively, according to standard
methods. As a reference population for plasma arginine
and ornithine levels, we used 12,837 samples from 10,618
patients without known inherited metabolic diseases or

parenteral nutrition that were treated during the previous 5
years at Necker Hospital.
TAZ gene testing
The patients or their parents gave written informed
consent for genetic testing. Genomic DNA was extracted
from blood using standard procedures. The coding se￾quence and exon-intron boundaries of the TAZ gene
were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
using primers and conditions that are described else￾where [4,22]. The TAZ mutations were numbered as
recommended by the Human Genome Variation Society
(http://www.hgvs.org/) using the reference sequence
NM_000116.3.
Statistical analysis
Stata software version 10 was used for all statistical ana￾lyses. Range (minimum-maximum) values and median
values were used to represent the distribution of quanti￾tative variables. The number of births per year in France
(metropolitan areas excluding Reunion Island, French
Polynesia and French Antilles) was extracted from re￾cords at the Institut National de la Statistique et des
Etudes Economiques (www.insee.fr). The incidence at
birth was assumed to satisfy a Poisson distribution. For
survival analysis, the endpoint was death. The period
taken into account was the time interval from birth until
death (if the patient died) or, alternatively, from birth
until the last examination (if the patient was still alive at
the end of the study period). The Kaplan-Meier method
was used to estimate survival rates. Survival was
compared between groups using the log-rank test, and
the Cox model was used for multivariate analysis. The
cut-off date was September 1, 2012. Foetal data were not
included in the statistical analysis for survival.
Results
Demographic data
We analysed data from 22 subjects in 16 pedigrees
(Additional file 2: Figure S2). The patient characteristics
are shown in Table 1. Six individuals that were referred
as potential BTHS patients in different pedigrees were
excluded because of a lack of clinical data (families 4
and 11; Additional file 2: Figure S2). Medical informa￾tion about the 22 patients was collected from a total of
26 sources, which illustrates the complexity of the
medical management of this disease. All patients were
Caucasians, including three patients of Tunisian origin
(family 11) while the others were of European ancestry.
One patient was a girl (UPN 5938) for whom cytogenetic
analysis showed mosaicism for X monosomy and for a
ring X chromosome; her characteristics were reported
elsewhere [22]. The BTHS diagnosis was confirmed by
the presence of a TAZ mutation in 18 patients (73%),
and the 4 other patients had a presumptive diagnosis
based on an informative cardiolipin profile in 1 and clin￾ical signs of BTHS in a proven pedigree in 3. At least 1
affected relative was found for 14 patients (64%). The
median age at presentation was 3.1 weeks (range, 0–1.4
years), and the median age at the last follow-up for the
11 living patients was 4.75 years (range, 3–15 years).
Cardiomyopathy was the presenting symptom in 16
(73%) patients, with 3 cases diagnosed prenatally. Infec￾tion was the presenting symptom in 4 patients (18%).
The other modes of onset are summarised in Table 1.
There was only one preterm newborn (born at 36
weeks of gestation). The median birth weight was 2770
g (range, 2180–3730 g) and 7 patients had severe IUGR
(32%). The estimated incidence at birth, calculated for
1995–2008, was 1.5 cases per million births, with 95%
confidence interval limits of 0.6 and 2.3 cases per
million births.
Genetics
Fourteen different mutations in the TAZ gene were
found in 15 different pedigrees. No mutation was identi￾fied in 1 pedigree. These mutations included 1 nonsense
mutation, 2 frameshift mutations, 6 amino acid substitu￾tions, 3 large deletions (more than one exon deleted)
and 2 splicing defect mutations. Some of these mutations
have been reported previously [7,14,22-27]. Excluding the
large TAZ deletions, the mutations in our patients were
in exon 2 (n = 1), exon 3 (n = 2), exon 4 (n = 1), exon 6
(n = 1), exon 8 (n = 4), exon 9 (n = 1), intron 9
(n = 1) and intron 10 (n = 1). The mutations are summa￾rized in Table 2. The 13 mothers of the 17 patients were
tested for TAZ mutations: 9 were carriers with somatic
TAZ mutations, and 1 had proven somatic mosaicism
(unpublished data). All of the mothers appeared to be
healthy, but no biological tests or heart ultrasounds were
performed.
Haematological features and infectious events
The median initial absolute neutrophil count (ANC) was
1.3 × 109
/L (range, 0–6.4 × 109
/L) and 4 patients (18%)
had an initial ANC ≤ 0.5 × 109
/L. The median age at first
CBC was 1.2 months (range, 0–2.2 years). During
follow-up, a median of 8 CBC values per patient was
available (range, 1–46 values). The median baseline
white blood cell count (WBC) was 7.6 × 109
/L (range,
3.4–15.5 × 109
/L) and the median baseline ANC was
0.98 × 109
/L (range, 0–13.6 × 109
/L). In all cases with
serial CBCs, the ANC fluctuated over time without any
detectable regular variation. Sixteen patients (73%) had
an ANC <0.5 × 109
/L at least once, and 2 (9%) had a
median ANC <0.5 × 109
/L. The median absolute
lymphocyte count (ALC) was 4.3 × 109
/L (range, 1.9–
10.5 × 109
/L) and the median absolute monocyte count

(AMC) was 1.1 × 109
/L (range, 0.5–4.3 × 109
/L). The me￾dian haemoglobin (Hb) level was 11.2 g/dL (range, 9.7–
15.1 g/dL) and the median platelet count was 336 × 109
/L
(range, 194–591109
/L). Transient anaemia (≤7 g/dL) was
observed in 2 patients and was probably caused by
iterative blood sampling during intensive care hospitalisa￾tion. At baseline, 5 bone marrow smears were available, 2
(40%) of which showed typical promyelocyte-myelocyte
maturation arrest. Even in samples in which there was not
a complete myeloid arrest, we observed a greatly de￾creased proportion of myelocytes, metamyelocytes and
neutrophils, and an increased proportion of promyelocytes
(Figure 1). GCSF was used to prevent infection in 6 pa￾tients. Only 2 patients received long-term GCSF therapy.
In the other 4 cases, GCSF was used “on demand” i.e.
when an infection occurred. Four patients received anti￾biotic prophylaxis.
We recorded 94 infectious events, including 10 severe
and 84 mild infections. The 10 severe infections were
observed in 5 patients (23%). These infections were cel￾lulitis in 3 cases, pneumonia in 3 cases and septicaemia
in 4 cases. Septicaemia led to septic shock in 3 cases and

was associated with another infection in 2 cases. The
median age of the first severe infection was 3.7 months
(range: 0.2–30.7 months).
Bacterial pathogens were identified in 6 cases: Pseudo￾monas aeruginosa in two cases and Staphylococcus
epidermidis, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae
and Mycoplasma pneumonia in 1 case each. We did not
find any infections caused by a fungal agent. Although 84
mild infections were recorded, some, such as bronchitis or
upper respiratory tract infections that lacked proof of viral
infection, can have serious consequences. In all, 16 patients
(73%) were hospitalised during infectious episodes, and
there were a total of 56 hospitalisations, 11 of which
required ICU admission. Four patients died during an
infectious episode, 2 of septic shock and 2 of cardiac failure
associated with high fever without bacterial documentation.
Acute stomatitis occurred in just 1 patient. No chronic
periodontal disease was reported. One patient had repeated
episodes of diarrhoea.
Cardiology features
Twenty patients (91%) had symptomatic cardiomyop￾athy. One of the oldest patients of the cohort (UPN
7112, age 12.6 years) never showed any clinical signs of
cardiomyopathy. The other patient died early (at 1
month) of septic shock and suspicion of acute myocardi￾tis, but autopsy results did not confirm cardiomyopathy
(UPN 5933).
The 20 patients (91%) with clinical evidence of cardiomy￾opathy were each hospitalised at least once for heart failure
episodes, and there were a total of 54 hospitalisations for
heart failure. In 11/54 (20%) of the episodes, heart failure
worsening was due to infection. During follow-up, 16 of the
20 patients (73%) needed inotropic support, 14 (64%)
needed invasive ventilation and 11 (50%) were treated with
both inotropic agents and invasive ventilation at least once.
One patient needed a paediatric ventricular assist device
before cardiac transplant. Four patients were on a cardiac
transplant list, and 2 of them underwent cardiac transplant.
UPN 5930 is alive 7 years after transplant, and UPN 5939
died the day after transplantation of cardiac arrest due to
electromechanical dissociation. Two of the patients on the
transplant list never received a heart transplant: UPN 7105
died of heart failure, and UPN 7101 recovered and was
withdrawn from the transplant list. Finally, 9 patients died
of heart failure.
Four of these patients never received any treatment
for heart failure: 2 never needed any treatment (UPN
7112, aged 12.4 years at last follow-up, and UPN 5932,
aged 13.4 years at last follow-up); 1 died early of septic
shock and had no previous signs of cardiomyopathy; and
1 had no documented medication in his medical records
but did have evidence of chronic heart failure. Of the 20
patients who presented with documented heart failure,
most of them (n = 16) received aggressive treatment for
heart failure, including inotropic agents (n = 16), mech￾anical ventilation (n = 14) or both (n = 11).
Among the 9 untransplanted living patients, 7 needed
inotropic support and/or mechanical ventilation at least
once. These 7 patients received a total of three to five
other medications for chronic heart failure (Table 3)
when the heart failure was at its worst. At last follow-up,
4 patients did not need any cardiac medication. Medical
management of cardiac failure of BTHS patients has
improved since 2000, with more widespread use of beta￾blockers for chronic heart failure and milrinone for
acute heart failure.
An echocardiogram at diagnosis was available for 17
patients. At diagnosis, the median LVEDD z-score was
4.5 (range, -0.7–12.7), the median LV-mass z-score was
3.5 (range, -0.4–8.6), the median SF was 16% (range,
8.5–34%) and the median EF was 32.5% (range, 16.3–
70%). Six of the 11 patients who had information
available at diagnosis had associated dilated cardiomyop￾athy (DCM) and hypertrophy cardiomyopathy (HCM)
(54.5%), 2 had DCM only and 1 had HCM only. In
addition, 7 patients (32%) had prominent trabeculations
of the LV, either on echocardiogram or on MRI, and
were considered to have left ventricular noncompaction
(LVNC).
During follow-up, a total of 266 echocardiograms were
performed, with a median of 12.5 echocardiograms per
patient (range, 1–31 echocardiograms). All of the 15 pa￾tients with LV mass z-score and LVEDD z-score that
could be measured on the same echocardiograms during
follow-up had both DCM and HCM. The evolution of
the echocardiographic parameters with age showed that
LVEDD and LV mass z-scores varied according to the
same patterns (Figure 2). Specifically, LVEDD (Figure 2C)
and LV mass (Figure 2D) were elevated and increased
during the first 6 months of life. After 6 months, LVEDD

and LV mass tended to decrease until the age of 2 years
and remained stable after that. In our series, we were
not able to follow the evolution of these cardiac parame￾ters later in life because of the limited number of older
children in the series. Similarly, the LVEF was altered in
the first 6 months of life (Figure 2B) and tended to
improve thereafter. There were some cases in which LV
systolic function recovered fully. Notably, there was
important inter-individual variation, especially in the
narrow age categories, as shown by wide distribution
ranges and interquartile intervals for all of the cardiology
parameters.
Twenty patients had records of at least one ECG, and
a total of 46 ECGs were recorded. All of them showed
normal sinus rhythms. Repolarisation abnormalities were
found in 36 ECG s from 17 patients (77.3%). Repolariza￾tion abnormalities were predominantly ST flattening and
T-wave inversion. The median QTc was 440 ms (range,
360–530 ms), and only 25% of the cases presented
values within the normal range if QTc <420 ms was con￾sidered normal while 25% presented with QTc > 460 ms.
All patients had normal QRS duration. Eight patients
completed at least one 24-hour Holter monitor. There
was no evidence of atrial or ventricular arrhythmia.
Skeletal myopathy and other clinical features
The age for walking was available for 8 patients who sur￾vived until the age of 2.5 years, and the median age for
walking was 19 months (range, 12 –24). All of the
patients that were able to walk ambulated independently;
none of them needed a wheelchair. Muscle biopsy
samples were available for 7 patients and showed lipid
storage myopathy in 6 of them. None of the patients had
severe mental retardation, and all patients showed
normal academic progression. Seven patients needed
long-term enteral nutritional support. Five of the 10
living patients were below the 3rd percentile in weight

for their age, and 5 were below −3 SDs in height for
their age.
Biochemical data
Three-methylglutaconic aciduria was found in 8 of the
16 patients tested (50%) at diagnosis. A cardiolipin study
was performed in 16 patients, in lymphoblasts for 1 pa￾tient, in platelets for 1, and in cultured fibroblasts for
the others. All of the screened patients had an inform￾ative profile that showed low cardiolipin (CL) levels, the
presence of monolysocardiolipin (MLCL) and an ele￾vated MLCL/CL ratio. In all cases in which both a CL
study and TAZ testing were available, the two results
were in agreement. A total of 15 plasma amino acid pro￾files were available for 8 patients. These 8 patients
showed low arginine levels as compared to a cohort of
over ten thousand patients that had no known metabolic
diseases (p < 10-6, Wilcoxon rank sum test; Figure 3).
Thus, a reduced arginine level appears to be a feature
that is found consistently in a sizeable fraction of BTHS
patients. These results are consistent with unpublished
work by Dr. Kelley (Kennedy Krieger Institute).
Survival
Eleven of the 22 patients died during the study period.
The median age at death was 5.1 months (range,
1.2–30.7). Death was caused by cardiac failure in 9 of 11
patients and was associated with a febrile episode, prob￾ably of viral origin, in 2 of the 9 patients. Death was due
to septic shock in the other 2 patients. Figure 4A shows
that mortality was high during the first three years of
life, especially in infants. The 5-year survival rate was
51% (95%CI: 29.1%–69.3%), while a plateau was ob￾served later. The following potential prognostic factors
for survival were studied in univariate analysis: heart
function parameters at diagnosis (including shortening
fraction, ejection fraction and LV mass), neutrophil
count, platelet count, haemoglobin levels at diagnosis,
birth weight and the year of birth (before vs. in or after
2000). We stratified the birth year as before vs. in or after
2000 because several new drugs were introduced for the
medical management of heart dysfunction during this
period, including milrinone and beta-blockers. While the
parameters of the heart ultrasound at diagnosis showed no
obvious impact on survival, two prognostic factors stood
out: the severity of neutropenia at the first CBC and the
birth year. Patients with absolute neutrophil counts <0.5 ×
109
/L had a 1-year survival rate of 25%, while those in
whom ANC was above 0.5 ×109
/L had a 1-year survival
rate of 68%. The 4 patients with severe initial neutropenia
died by age 5 years, while 62% of patients without severe
neutropenia survived past their 5th birthdays (p = 0.004).
Survival was also significantly different depending on the
year of birth: the 5-year survival rate was 22% in patients
born before 2000 vs. 70% in patients born in or after 2000
(Figure 4B). When these two prognostic factors were
analysed together in a Cox model, they both remained
associated with mortality.
Discussion
Here we described the French national cohort of pa￾tients with BTHS. We identified 22 cases in 16 pedigrees
and performed a longitudinal data analysis that provides
a detailed description of the cardiac and haematological
parameters and the outcomes of the disease. This study
suggests that BTHS is an extremely rare disease with an
estimated incidence of 1.5 cases per million live births.
This incidence rate was calculated for the 1995–2008
Figure 3 Plasma arginine levels. Levels are shown in samples
from patients in the French Barth syndrome cohort (15 samples) and
in samples from an entire hospital patient population (12,828
samples). The plot shows that 95% of the samples from Barth Sd
patients fall below the lower 25-percentile of randomly selected
patients. Y-axis: concentration in micromoles/litre. From left to right,

period and our analysis included all patients that had a
confirmed BTHS diagnosis during this period. However,
we cannot exclude the possibility that some patients
with milder clinical courses who may not have required
medical attention or who died suddenly may have
remained undiagnosed. Such patients were not included
in our survey. The incidence rate is close to a previous
preliminary estimate of 1 case per 500,000 live births
[28], considerably lower than a recent report from the
UK of 1:140,000 [8], although our confidence intervals
were larger. Our result is the first estimate based on a
comprehensive national survey that combined several
sources of information, including both cardiology and
haematology paediatric networks, as well as a parents’
association directory. However, our BTHS French cohort
did not include any adult cases and included a very lim￾ited number of adolescents, whereas patients in these
age categories are present in other clinical studies
[9,29-31] and are registered with the Barth Syndrome
Foundation (BSF). The lack of enrolment of teenagers
and adults may thus represent an underestimation of the
prevalence of the disease and limit our observations of
morbid complications in adults. However, this should
not affect the calculation of the incidence at birth, since
our enrolment is likely exhaustive for the time period
during which the incidence was estimated.
Patients with BTHS are predisposed to premature
death. It is quite difficult to analyse the mortality rate in
BTHS using data in the literature. The initial description
[1,12,24,32] found a high and very early mortality. In a
recent study of 6 pedigrees, 6 deaths were observed
among 13 proven BTHS cases; 5 patients died at birth
or before the age of 1 month, while one died at age 7
years [27] (Additional file 1: Table S1). However, other
studies demonstrate the possibility of long-term survival
in patients with BTHS, although it is unclear whether
this is the result of better medical management or if the
improvement in survival is related to better identifica￾tion of cases thanks to improvements in diagnosis [33].
The severity of the initial BTHS cases that were de￾scribed in the literature resulted in estimates of almost
90% mortality in young patients with BTHS. This con￾trasts with several cross-sectional studies of young adults
with BTHS [9,10,31] that show relatively few deaths in
children or young adults (5 deaths at ages 5.8, 7.4, 16.2,
23.0 and 25.4 years among 73 patients). Our study rec￾onciles this apparent contradiction, showing that mortal￾ity in BTHS peaks in the first years of life and then falls.
Our study, which has limited information about teens
and adults, did not allow us to evaluate the late mortality
that was observed in another study [9]. In all cases, the
outcome is driven by cardiac events associated with
acute infections. Some of these infections were related
to neutropenia, but simple viral infections may be com￾plicated by cardiac failure. In our survey, babies who
survived the first year showed good survival with limited
morbidity. Notably, when we compared survival in ba￾bies born before and after 2000, we found that the me￾dian age at death did not change but that overall
survival was improved (Figure 4B). We interpret this im￾provement to be a consequence of advances in the man￾agement of acute and chronic heart failure in children.
In particular, the systematic use of beta-blockers and
modern inotropic drugs like milrinone have decreased
the incidence of heart failure, both isolated or during an
infectious episode, which is the main cause of death in

number of patients is quite limited, the difference in survival is both important (survival at 5 years: 22% for patients born before 2000 and 70% for
patients born in or after 2000) and statistically significant (p = 0.009). This suggests that recent progress in the management of heart dysfunction
may improve the survival of patients with BTHS.

BTHS. Importantly, this improvement in survival did
not correlate with heart transplantation. Only 2 patients
in our survey underwent heart transplantation, one of
which showed long term survival. Indeed, management
of cardiomyopathy is a key and vital issue in BTHS. The
most frequent type of cardiomyopathy in BTHS is di￾lated cardiomyopathy [10]. Here, we described an un￾usual phenotype i.e. dilatation of the left ventricle with
hypertrophied walls. This hypertrophied-dilated pheno￾type is also observed in respiratory chain defects [34]
and in LVNC. Even if it is non-pathognomonic because
it can also be seen in respiratory chain defects, this car￾diac phenotype in a male infant is highly suggestive of
BTHS and should prompt the physician to search for
other phenotypes associated with the syndrome, particu￾larly low ANC. LVNC was observed in only a third of
our patients, which is a lower proportion than reported
previously [10]. This might be due to the retrospective
nature of our study in which echocardiograms were not
reviewed to search for prominent trabeculations. The
evolution of cardiac functional parameters i.e. LVEDD z￾score, LV mass z-score, SF and EF, correlated with the
shape of the survival curve. Cardiac functional parame￾ters also correlated with very poor cardiac outcomes in
the first year of life. After two years of age, the cardiac
function of the patients continued to improve and was
normal thereafter in most cases. The ECG data matched
the findings of the BTHS cohort [10], showing an in￾creased median QTc and showing that approximately
25% of patients had prolonged QTc values >460 millisec￾onds. Conversely, we did not document any atrial or
ventricular arrhythmias in our patients; nevertheless,
one possible explanation is that arrhythmia in BTHS is
generally reported in patients older than 11 years, an
age that was marginally represented in our cohort
[10,16]. Although this study provides data on the
evolution of cardiac parameters in BTHS, we do not
have information for teenagers, young adults or adults
as we did not recruit any patients that were over 13
years old.
Neutropenia is a classical characteristic of BTHS and
represents an important clue for BTHS diagnosis. In
about 20% of cases, the presenting symptoms of BTHS
are infections facilitated by neutropenia. During follow￾up, we observed that 19 patients had episodes of neutro￾penia, while 3 had no episodes of neutropenia; however,
the latter had a limited number of blood examinations
(1 or 2) during follow-up.
The prevalence of neutropenia in this study is higher
than the previously reported rate of 25% [10], but is
close to the prevalence reported in two studies for the
BTS registry (69% [9], and 90% [8]) in which neutro￾penia was self-reported and is consistent with the
historical description of BTHS [1,33].
Indeed, we observed that neutropenia was an intermit￾tent feature in our series and could sometimes be
diagnosed only during follow-up with routine blood
sampling. None of our patients exhibited cyclic neutro￾penia as described in the 1990s [1,26,33,35]. ANC is
unpredictable in BTHS in that a single normal ANC
count in male infants with cardiomyopathy does not
exclude BTHS. Despite the frequency of neutropenia,
the clinical consequences are difficult to assess. Neutro￾penia in BTHS could be life threatening by allowing
severe infections or by facilitating infections that lead to
heart failure. Notably, although neutropenia seemed to
respond well to GCSF treatment, two episodes of severe
infection, including one episode of septic shock, oc￾curred while patients were on GCSF therapy. Despite
chronic neutropenia, we did not record any chronic
gingivostomatitis or periodontal disease, in contrast to
the other manifestations of congenital neutropenia [36].
Even if rare or underdiagnosed in our survey, such oral
manifestation is a useful indication for GCSF. Bone mar￾row examination showed mild or profound maturation
arrest, as described for other congenital neutropenias
such as those associated with the ELANE mutation [21].
In addition, none of the living patients had secondary
leukaemia; this distinguishes BTHS from other subtypes
of congenital neutropenia, even though the number of
reported cases of BTHS is limited.
Our study provides additional information about the
growth characteristics of patients with BTHS. We
reported that about 30% of newborns with BTHS had a
birth weight below the 3rd percentile. The proportion of
severe IUGR in BTHS is not known and remains contro￾versial [28,37]. In a recently survey of 73 cases, 20% of
BTHS patients were reported to have a birth weight
below 2.5 kg [9]. In fact, when analysing all BTHS case
reports that report birth weight (n = 45), about 30% of
the patients show a birth weight that is below the 3rd
percentile, a proportion that is higher than that of the
normal population and which is consistent with our
findings. In addition, we observed that the heights of
half of the patients over 5 years old fell below the 3rd
percentile. We found low arginine levels in most of the
plasma samples we tested, which could lead to a reduced
growth rate (Figure 3). This finding is consistent with a
partial defect in the Krebs cycle that could lead to argin￾ine being metabolized into alpha-ketoglutaric acid at a
higher than normal rate. Whatever the mechanism(s) in￾volved, arginine depletion may have detrimental effects
due to limitations in protein synthesis [38]. This may
support the use of arginine supplementation as an auxil￾iary therapy for improving the growth rate of BTHS
patients.
Signs of skeletal myopathy in patients have often been
described by clinicians [39], but no objective data are
Rigaud et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases 2013, 8:70 Page 11 of 13
http://www.ojrd.com/content/8/1/70

available. However, we noticed a slight gross motor delay
and an increased median age of walking. There was no
associated mental retardation.
Disease-causing mutations have been found in all exons
of the TAZ gene [4,40,41]. The TAZ mutations in our co￾hort have been reported in previous studies [7,14,22-27]
and/or in the BSF TAZ mutations database [28]. Allelic het￾erogeneity is high in BTHS, and the intrafamilial variability
of expression is high. Thus, no genotype-phenotype correl￾ation has been observed in any series, including ours [7,27].
Half of the mothers that were tested for TAZ mutations
were carriers. One of the mothers we tested had 2 affected
children (UPN 5935 and UPN 5936) but Sanger sequencing
did not show any somatic TAZ mutations. However, the
mother had somatic mosaïcism [unpublished data] and
most probably gonadal mosaicism, as suspected in a
Japanese family with BTHS [41].
Notably, both in our cohort and in other BTHS patients
[42], 3-methylglutaconic aciduria was not found consist￾ently in BTHS patients, even when the assay was repeated
in a given patient; thus, this result must not be considered
mandatory for a definitive diagnosis of BTHS.
Finally, the natural course of this disease illustrates the
benefits of an interdisciplinary approach. In particular, a
diagnosis of cardiomyopathy in a newborn or infant
should lead to repeated tests to determine whether low
ANC is present. The reverse is also true: It may be
worth adding cardiac evaluation to the workup of the
diagnosis of a chronic neutropenia suspected to be con￾genital. This diagnostic work-up should be performed in
close cooperation with geneticists and metabolic disease
specialists.
