Abstract
Adriamycin (ADR) is a potent anticancer drug known to
cause severe cardiac toxicity. Although ADR generates free
radicals, the role of free radicals in the development of car￾diac toxicity and the intracellular target for ADR-induced
cardiac toxicity are still not well understood. We produced
three transgenic mice lines expressing increased levels of
human manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), a mito￾chondrial enzyme, as an animal model to investigate the
role of ADR-mediated free radical generation in mitochon￾dria. The human MnSOD was expressed, functionally ac￾tive, and properly transported into mitochondria in the
heart of transgenic mice. The levels of copper-zinc SOD,
catalase, and glutathione peroxidase did not change in the
transgenic mice. Electron microscopy revealed dose-depen￾dent ultrastructural alterations with marked mitochondrial
damage in nontransgenic mice treated with ADR, but not in
the transgenic littermates. Biochemical analysis indicated
that the levels of serum creatine kinase and lactate dehydro￾genase in ADR-treated mice were significantly greater in
nontransgenic than their transgenic littermates expressing a
high level of human MnSOD after ADR treatment. These
results support a major role for free radical generation in
ADR toxicity as well as suggesting mitochondria as the crit￾ical site of cardiac injury. (J. Clin. Invest. 1996. 98:1253–

Introduction
Adriamycin (ADR)1
, a quinone-containing anthracycline anti￾biotic, is an important anticancer drug used in treating a wide
spectrum of human neoplasms, but the development of severe
cardiac toxicity in humans compromises its clinical effective￾ness (for review see reference 1). The cardiac toxicity has been
well established using both physiological and ultrastructural
studies (1), and has been shown after both chronic and acute
treatment (1, 2). It has been demonstrated that ADR is meta￾bolically activated to a free radical state and interacts with mo￾lecular oxygen to generate superoxide radicals (for review see
references 3 and 4). It has been postulated that superoxide is
generated through redox cycling of ADR in vivo. Superoxide
radicals can react with hydrogen peroxide to form highly reac￾tive hydroxyl radicals via the iron catalyzed Haber-Weiss reac￾tion. The secondarily derived hydroxyl radicals can cause pro￾tein and DNA damage and initiate lipid peroxidation (5).
Increased lipid peroxidation, and enhanced free radical gener￾ation in the heart have been demonstrated after administration
of ADR (1–4, 6–8). However, whether free radicals generated
by ADR are responsible for the cardiac toxicity is not certain
because of difficulties in interpreting results obtained from
studies using exogenous antioxidants (4). First, the results
from different studies have not been consistent partially be￾cause of the biochemical methods used (3, 4). Second, the en￾try of exogenous antioxidants into cells has not been demon￾strated in these studies. Finally, the intracellular localization of
these antioxidants was not identified.
Superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glu￾tathione peroxidase (GPX) are the primary antioxidant en￾zymes in mammalian tissues. SOD catalyzes the dismutation of
superoxide to hydrogen peroxide, which is further detoxified
by CAT and GPX (9). In humans, there are three forms of
SOD: a homodimeric CuZnSOD found primarily in the cy￾tosol (10), a homotetrameric glycosylated CuZnSOD in the
extracellular space (11), and a homotetrameric MnSOD in the
mitochondrial matrix (12). Mitochondria are the primary
source of endogenous superoxide radicals under normal physi￾ological conditions (13), and are susceptible to oxidative dam￾age, especially in myocardial tissue (14, 15). Although mito￾chondrial dysfunction, as documented by inhibition of oxidative
phosphorylation, decreased ATP synthesis, and disrupted cal￾cium homeostasis with subsequent cell death, has been ob￾served in ADR-induced cardiac toxicity (1, 8, 16–19), addi￾tional subcellular alterations including intracytoplasmic
vacuoles, dilated sarcoplasmic reticulum, and myofibril disar￾ray have also been identified (1). Therefore, it is not clear
whether mitochondria are indeed the primary target for ADR￾induced cardiac toxicity, or whether the mitochondrial injury is
a secondary event after the damage of other organelles.
To investigate the significance of free radical generation
and determine whether mitochondria are the primary target in
ADR-induced cardiac toxicity, we produced transgenic mice
which expressed increased levels of human MnSOD under the
control of the human b-actin promoter. The expression, local￾Part of this work has been presented as an abstract less than 400

ization, and levels of human MnSOD were extensively charac￾terized. The extent of ADR-induced cardiac toxicity was de￾termined by ultrastructural pathology studies of the heart
tissues in mice. The total serum creatine kinase (CK) and lac￾tate dehydrogenase (LDH) activities were also monitored in
mice after ADR treatment.
Methods
Construct of the transgene. The construct of the human MnSOD trans￾gene is shown in Fig. 1. The transgene consists of human MnSOD
cDNA and the human b-actin 59 flanking sequence and promoter. It
was constructed by inserting the human MnSOD cDNA (20) flanked
by EcoRI restriction sites into the human b-actin expression vector
pHbAPr-1 (21) as described previously (22). The fragment of the
construct without the plasmid was further purified for producing
transgenic mice.
Generation and maintenance of transgenic mice. The transgene was
introduced into the pronuclei of mouse fertilized eggs by microinjec￾tion as described by Hogan et al. (23). This procedure was performed
in the Transgenic Facility at the University of Kentucky. The mice
used for producing transgenic mice were the F1 progeny of C57BL/6
3 C3H hybrids (B6C3) which were purchased from Harlan Sprague
Dawley (Indianapolis, IN). Four founders with stably integrated hu￾man MnSOD transgenes were identified by Southern analysis from
mouse tail DNA. Three transgenic mice lines were produced and
maintained from three founders. All transgenic mice were propa￾gated as heterozygous transgenic mice. The mice used in the present
study were from the inbred of B6C3 mice.
Southern blot analysis. To identify transgenic mice carrying the
human MnSOD transgene, genomic DNA was isolated from mouse
tail as described by Laird et al. (24). Tail DNA was digested with the
restriction enzyme PstI, separated on a 0.9% agarose gel and trans￾ferred to Nytran paper (Schleicher & Schuell, Keene, NH). The blot
was air dried, baked, prehybridized, hybridized with the 32P-labeled
human MnSOD cDNA probe, and subsequently washed under high
stringency conditions as described previously (25). The blot was then
exposed to Kodak XAR film at 2808C.
Northern analysis. Total RNA from the heart tissues of nontrans￾genic mice and transgenic mice was isolated by the guanidine isothio￾cyanate method as described (26). Total RNA (20 mg/lane) was size￾separated by formaldehyde-agarose (1.1%) gel electrophoresis and
transferred to Nytran paper (Schleicher & Schuell). Hybridization,
washing, and autoradiography were performed as described for
Southern analysis.
SOD activity gel. SOD activity gel was performed according to
the method described by Beauchamp and Fridovich (27) with slight
modifications. Tissues were homogenized in 50 mM potassium phos￾phate buffer (pH 7.8). 200 mg protein/lane was electrophoresed
through a nondissociating riboflavin gel consisting of 5% stacking gel
(pH 6.8) and a 10% running gel (pH 8.8) at 48C. To visualize SOD ac￾tivity, gels were first incubated in 2.43 mM nitro blue tetrazolium
(NBT) in deionized water for 15 min and then in 0.028 mM riboflavin/
280 mM N, N, N9, N9- tetramethyl-ethylenediamine (TEMED) in 50
mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.8) for 15 min in the dark. Gels
were then washed in deionized water and illuminated under fluores￾cent light until clear zones of SOD activity were distinctly evident.
SOD activity assay. The heart homogenate was used for SOD ac￾tivity assay. SOD activities were measured by the NBT-bathocu￾proine sulfonate (BCS) reduction inhibition method as described by
Spitz and Oberley (28). 5 mM sodium cyanide was used to inhibit
CuZnSOD and thus measure only MnSOD activity. BCS and sodium
cyanide were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Company (Milwau￾kee, WI).
CAT and GPX activity assay. Heart homogenates were centri￾fuged at 8,000 g and the supernatant was used to measure GPX and
CAT activities. CAT activity was measured as described by Beers and
Sizer (29). GPX activity was measured as described (30, 31). 0.25 mM
hydrogen peroxide was used as the substrate for the GPX assay.
Immunogold staining for human MnSOD. Tissues were cut in 1-mm3
blocks and fixed in Carson Millonig’s fixative (4% formaldehyde in
0.16 M monobasic sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2) for electron im￾munogold analysis and processed as previously described (32).
Animal treatment. 11 to 13-wk-old-mice were treated with ADR
(2 mg/ml in saline, purchased from Adria Laboratories, Columbus,
OH) intraperitoneally at total doses of 10, 20, or 25 mg/kg. Animals
were killed after 5 d and the hearts were removed and further pro￾cessed for pathological studies. For the study of serum CK and LDH
activities, male mice were treated with 25 mg/kg of ADR for 3 d and
blood was collected by cardiac puncture. Animals were anesthetized
with 65 mg/kg of phentobarbital (The Butler Company, Columbus,
OH) before being killed.
Electron microscopy. Heart tissues were cut in 1-mm3
 blocks,
fixed in half strength Karnovskys fixative (2% paraformaldehyde and
2.5% glutaraldehyde in phosphate buffer, pH 7.3) for 2 h, rinsed with
the same buffer, and then postfixed in Caulfield’s osmium tetroxide
for 30 min. Tissues were then rinsed with water, dehydrated in a
graded ethanol series with 100% propylene oxide as a transitional
solvent, and embedded in Epon 812 (Electron Microscopy Sciences,
Fort Washington, PA). Thin sections were cut with an LKB ultrami￾crotome (Ultratone NOVA, LKB 2188, Bromma, Sweden) and trans￾ferred to copper grids. The grids were stained with lead citrate and
uranyl acetate, and observed in a Hitachi H-300 electron microscope.
Total serum CK and LDH activity. The CK and LDH assay kits
were purchased from Sigma Chemical Company (St. Louis, MO)
(Cat No. 45-1 and Cat No. LD-340). Serum was collected within 2 h
after obtaining blood by centrifugation at 6,000 g for 6 min in Micro￾tainer Brand Serum Separator Tubes (Becton Dickinson, Ruther￾ford, NJ).
Statistical analysis. Data were evaluated using the SAS system
(SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) were
performed for multiple comparison of each dependent variable. The
CONTRAST command was used to test the statistical significance of
each pre-planned comparison. P value , 0.05 was considered to be
statistically significant. All data was presented as mean6SD.
Results
Characterization of transgenic mice. The expression of the steady
state mRNA from the human MnSOD transgene in various or￾gans of transgenic mice was initially demonstrated by North￾ern blot analysis (Fig. 2). Heart tissues had the most significant
amount of human MnSOD mRNA expression compared with
other organs. Lung tissues also had appreciable amount of ex￾pression. The expression in kidney tissues was limited. There
was very little expression of mRNA in livers with visualization
possible only after prolonged exposure of the x-ray films.
These results indicated that the human MnSOD transgene was
functional in the transgenic mice. An activity gel assay which
facilitated the identification of SODs isoenzymes demon￾strated the presence of human MnSOD activity in the heart

tissues of all three transgenic mice lines but not in their non￾transgenic littermates (Fig. 3). Under the conditions of this ac￾tivity gel, mouse MnSOD cannot be clearly visualized. The
level of mouse CuZnSOD appeared unchanged in the trans￾genic mice when compared to nontransgenic mice (Fig. 3).
Thus, the product of the human MnSOD transgene is func￾tional and active in the heart tissues of transgenic mice. Three
transgenic mice lines from three different founders exhibited a
range of levels (low, Tg-SOD-L; medium, Tg-SOD-M; high,
Tg-SOD-H) of human MnSOD activity (Fig. 3). 
Since MnSOD is a mitochondrial enzyme, it is important to
determine the intracellular location of the human MnSOD in
the transgenic mice. To identify the intracellular site where hu￾man MnSOD was located, immunogold analysis at the elec￾tron microscopic level was performed. Immunogold staining of
the heart tissues (Fig. 4) showed extensive labeling of the im￾munoreactive human MnSOD in the mitochondria of Tg￾SOD-H transgenic mice (Fig. 4 A), but only light labeling in
nontransgenic mice (Fig. 4 C). MnSOD labeling was not ob￾served in the cytoplasm or nucleus of either nontransgenic or
transgenic myocytes. Controls using nonimmune serum showed
no labeling (Fig. 4 B and D). Table I shows results of semi￾quantitation of immunogold bead for human MnSOD protein
in mitochondria. There was an approximate fourfold increase
in immunoreactive protein in the mitochondria of Tg-SOD-H
mice compared to nontransgenic mice. These results demon￾strated that the human MnSOD from the transgene was prop￾erly transported into the mitochondria in the heart tissues of
transgenic mice.
To monitor the effect of increased MnSOD in the heart tis￾sues of transgenic mice, we determined the activities of total
MnSOD, CuZnSOD, CAT, and GPX in the heart tissues of
the Tg-SOD-H transgenic mice line and their nontransgenic
littermates (Table II). There was a significant increase in the
total MnSOD in the heart tissues of the transgenic mice, but
no significant changes in CuZnSOD, CAT, and GPX activities
were found in transgenic mice. Activity assay indicated that
there was an approximate twofold increase in total MnSOD
activity. The discrepancy between MnSOD levels observed by
immunogold and activity assay may reflect the fact that immu￾nogold staining represents both active and inactive protein. On
the other hand, the cDNA used in the transgene has an Ile-58
to Thr polymorphism. The Ile-58 was found to be involved in
interaction of the four-helix bundle. Replacement of Ile-58

a lower enzymatic activity (33). Immunogold analysis of GPX
in the hearts of transgenic and nontransgenic mice showed no
differences in immunogold beads in myocytes (data not shown).
Ultrastructural pathology. To investigate the role of Mn￾SOD in the protection against ADR-induced cardiac toxicity,
Tg-SOD-H transgenic mice and nontransgenic mice were
treated with ADR at doses of 10, 20, or 25 mg/kg for 5 d. No
definitive pathological changes were found in the heart tissues
of nontransgenic and transgenic mice treated with ADR when
examined by hematoxylin and eosin staining at the light micro￾scopic level (not shown). However, when ultrastructural stud￾ies were performed, the ventricular tissues from ADR-treated
nontransgenic mice showed marked myocardial damage at all

Mn Superoxide Dismutase and Adriamycin-induced Cardiac Toxicity 1257
tested doses. These changes consisted of mitochondrial dam￾age, the accumulation of intracytoplasmic vacuoles, and focal
myofilament disarray (Fig. 5 A, C, and E). Myocardial damage
was dose dependent. The ventricles of transgenic mice treated
with ADR showed normal ultrastructure of cardiomyocytes at
all doses tested (Fig. 5 B, D, and F).
Ultrastructural analysis of heart tissues from nontransgenic
and transgenic mice treated with 25 mg/kg for 5 d indicated
that the hearts of all transgenic mice were protected from
ADR-induced subcellular damage. Nontransgenic mice treated
with adriamycin showed extensive ultrastructural changes.
These changes varied between individual myocytes (Fig. 6 a, c,
e) and consisted of mitochondrial damage, myofilament disar￾ray, and cytoplasmic vacuolization. ADR-treated transgenic
mice (Tg-SOD-L, Tg-SOD-M, and Tg-SOD-H) did not appear
to show significant cardiac damage although occasional focal
loss of cristae in the mitochondria was observed (Fig. 6 b, d, f).
Semiquantitative analysis of the relative amount of abnor￾mal mitochondria (Table III) indicated that the mitochondria
of saline-treated Tg-SOD-H transgenic mice had a low fre￾quency of mild alterations (minimal loss of cristae) in mito￾chondrial morphology compared to the saline-treated non￾transgenic mice, while almost all mitochondria were markedly
abnormal (extensive loss of cristae, intramitochondrial vacu￾oles, mitochondrial swelling, and abnormal shape) in the heart
tissue of ADR-treated nontransgenic mice at the dose of 25
mg/kg. Most importantly, the mitochondria of ADR-treated
Tg-SOD-H transgenic mice were distinctly protected from
ADR-induced cardiac injury.
Serum CK and LDH. Our pilot experiments showed that
there were significant increases in serum CK and LDH in mice
at 3 d after ADR treatment, but the levels declined at 5 d (data
not shown). Total serum CK and LDH levels in mice treated
with 25 mg/kg ADR for 3 d was shown in Tables IV and V.
Two sets of experiments were performed. One set is for non￾transgenic mice and Tg-SOD-L transgenic mice; the other set
is for nontransgenic, Tg-SOD-M, and Tg-SOD-H transgenic
mice. The serum CK and LDH in nontransgenic mice and
transgenic mice after ADR treatment were both significantly
different from that in their saline control groups (P , 0.002)
for either CK or LDH. There was no difference in CK or LDH
levels between saline-treated nontransgenic mice and trans￾genic mice. The serum CK in Tg-SOD-H transgenic mice
treated with ADR was significantly lower than that in non￾transgenic mice treated with ADR (P 5 0.006). The serum
LDH in Tg-SOD-H transgenic mice was also significantly
lower than that in nontransgenic mice treated with ADR (P 5
0.001). There was a slight decrease in CK and LDH for Tg￾SOD-M transgenic mice compared with nontransgenic mice
after ADR treatment, although it was not statistically signifi￾cant (0.1 . P . 0.05). There was no significant difference be￾tween nontransgenic mice and Tg-SOD-L mice after ADR
treatment for both CK and LDH.
Discussion
Our results are the first to demonstrate the protective role of
MnSOD against ADR-induced cardiac toxicity in vivo and
support the hypothesis that the generation of superoxide radi￾cals in mitochondria plays an important role in ADR-induced
cardiac toxicity. Increased MnSOD in transgenic mice may
prevent cellular toxicity in the heart by scavenging superoxide
radicals produced from ADR.
The ultrastructure of heart tissues in Tg-SOD-H mice dem￾onstrated protection against ADR-induced cardiac injury in an
ADR dose-dependent manner. Suppression of cardiac injury
by elevated expression of human MnSOD in transgenic mice
occurred in all three transgenic mice lines with different levels
of MnSOD transgene. These results clearly indicated that in￾creased level of MnSOD in the mitochondria play an essential
role in the protection against ADR-induced cardiac toxicity.
Although in the animals observed, there were no obvious rela￾tionship between MnSOD levels and the degree of myocardial
protection, without morphometric quantitation, it would not
be possible to determine whether such a relationship existed.
It has been shown that exogenous SOD was ineffective in
protecting ADR-induced myocardial dysfunction of isolated rat
papillary muscles (34). Transgenic mice overexpressing Mn￾SOD endogenously, unlike exogenously administrated SOD,
would be available to scavenge free radical generated from
ADR endogenously in the mitochondria. Thus, our findings
indicate that the presence of SOD at the appropriate cellular
location is critical for the detoxification of ADR-induced tis￾sue injury. It has been shown that some antioxidants or com￾pounds with antioxidant properties could suppress ADR￾induced myocardial injury in rodents (2, 4, 35–37). However,
these results did not clearly indicate the subcellular site where
the antioxidants protected the cardiac tissue from ADR toxicity.
Our results suggest that free radical-mediated mitochon￾drial damage could be the primary and critical event in ADR￾induced cardiac toxicity. Mitochondria have been identified as
one of the targets in ADR-induced subcellular damage in the

heart (1), but its importance in relation to the alterations of
other organelles have not been well documented. As shown in
Figs. 5 and 6, the increase in the percentage of damaged mito￾chondria in the heart of nontransgenic mice corresponded with
the degree of other subcellular changes. Most importantly, the
protection of mitochondria by MnSOD against ADR-induced
cardiac injury in transgenic mice also alleviated other ultra￾structural alterations such as vacuolization and myofilament
disarray observed in the heart of nontransgenic mice. Thus,
our results suggest that mitochondrial damage mediated by
free radicals is the critical and early event that subsequently re￾sulted in other subcellular changes.
Since cardiac tissue is not an actively proliferating tissue,
the significant cardiac toxicity caused by ADR is unlikely due
to the interruption of DNA synthesis like the effect of ADR in
tumors. The critical role of mitochondria shown in our study
suggests that the sensitivity of myocardial tissue to ADR may
be partially due to the high energy demand of the heart, and
thus heart tissue is likely to be more dependent on the energy
generation function of intact mitochondria than other organs.
Resent studies of MnSOD knock out mice unequivocally dem￾onstrated the importance of MnSOD in the normal heart,
since those mice developed a severe cardiomyopathy (38).
It has been demonstrated that overexpression of CuZn￾SOD in cultured cells led to alteration of MnSOD and GPX
activities (39–41). However, we did not observe any significant
changes in CuZnSOD, CAT, and GPX activities in the trans￾genic mice expressing elevated levels of MnSOD (Table II).
Thus, we demonstrated that increased expression of MnSOD
in the heart did not cause elevation of other primary antioxi￾dant enzymes as a result of adaptive responses. Our results
were in agreement with those reported for transgenic mice
overexpressing human MnSOD in the lung in which there
were no significant changes in CuZnSOD, GPX, and CAT ac￾tivities (42). It has been suggested that excessive amount of
SOD may increase oxidative damage, and thus, the combina￾tion of SOD and CAT or GPX may be necessary to reduce ox￾idative stress rather than SOD alone (43–45). Our findings that
CuZnSOD, GPX, CAT activities were not changed signifi￾cantly with increased MnSOD activity in the heart of MnSOD
transgenic mice demonstrated that the protective effect seen in
transgenic mice was due to the increased level of MnSOD ac￾tivity.

used in the clinic as parameters for the diagnosis of cardiac dis￾Table IV. Total Serum CK Activities in Mice Treated with

mice treated with ADR. Mitochondria in (a), (c), and (e) show strik￾ing variation in size and shape, exhibit focal swelling and loss of cris￾tae. Arrows in (a) and (c) indicate extensive loss of cristae. Myofila￾ments (MF) show disarray with loss of Z-bands (b). Double arrow in 
(c) shows that cytoplasmic vacuolization is apparent. Mitochondria in 
(b), (d), and (f) show uniform size and shape and have essentially 
normal internal morphology, although occasional loss of cristae may 
be observed. Cardiac myofilaments are also normal in treated trans￾genic mice.

Mn Superoxide Dismutase and Adriamycin-induced Cardiac Toxicity 1259
eases (46). As shown in Tables IV and V, the total serum CK
and LDH were significantly increased in both nontransgenic
mice and transgenic mice after treated with 25 mg/kg of ADR
for 3 d compared with their saline controls. The increases in
both CK and LDH in Tg-SOD-H transgenic mice were signifi￾cantly lower than that in nontransgenic mice. However the re￾duction in both CK and LDH in Tg-SOD-M and Tg-SOD-L
mice were not statistically significant. It has been well estab￾lished that many conditions may cause the elevation of total
serum CK and LDH, thus they are not absolutely specific for
heart injury (46, 47). Since the elevated levels of MnSOD in
other organs were not as great as in the heart, the increases in
serum CK and LDH observed in ADR-treated transgenic
mice may imply toxicities in other organs besides the heart. On
the other hand, ADR may still cause a certain degree of tissue
damage in the heart of transgenic mice, but the damage may
not lead to subcellular ultrastructural alterations.
Since a major problem that limits the success of cancer
therapy is dose limiting normal tissue toxicities, the results
from this study should contribute significantly to the under￾standing of the defense of normal tissue against the toxic effect
of oxygen radicals generated by therapeutic agents. We have
previously shown that increased expression of MnSOD in a
mouse fibrosarcoma cell line (FSa-II) suppressed the metasta￾sis frequency of the cancer cells (48) and also reduced the tu￾mor control radiation dose (49). Taken together, our results
suggest that expression of MnSOD can enhance therapeutic
efficiency by increasing the normal tissue defense capability
and suppressing cancer invasion. Thus, it is possible that new
concepts of cancer therapy such as the development of specific
measures to augment MnSOD expression may lead to im￾provements in cancer treatment.
