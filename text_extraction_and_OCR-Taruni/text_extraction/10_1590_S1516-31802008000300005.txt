CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE:	Expanded	donor	
criteria	 (marginal)	 grafts	 are	 an	 important	
solution	 for	 organ	 shortage.	 Nevertheless,	
they	 raise	 an	 ethical	 dilemma	 because	 they	
may	increase	the	risk	of	transplant	failure.	This	
study	compares	the	outcomes	from	marginal	
and	non-marginal	graft	transplantation	in	103	
cases	 of	 liver	 transplantation	 due	 to	 chronic	
hepatic	failure.
DESIGN AND SETTING: One	 hundred	 and	
three	consecutive	liver	transplantations	to	treat	
chronic	 liver	 disease	 performed	 in	 the	 Liver	
Transplantation	Service	of	Hospital	das	Clínicas	
da	Faculdade	de	Medicina	da	Universidade	de	
São	Paulo	between	January	2001	and	March	
2006	were	retrospectively	analyzed.
METHODS:	We	estimated	graft	quality	according	
to	a	validated	scoring	system.	We	assessed	the	
pre-transplantation	liver	disease	category	using	
the	Model	for	End-Stage	Liver	Disease	(MELD),	
as	low	MELD	(<	20)	or	high	MELD	(≥	20).	The

INTRODUCTION
Organ shortage is a major problem in liver 
transplantation. The use of expanded donor 
criteria (marginal) grafts is an option used 
worldwide to increase the organ supply for 
transplantation. Marginal grafts are defi ned 
as those that involve the use of organs recov￾ered from elderly donors (> 60 years old) or 
that present other harmful characteristics 
that may give rise to the danger that these 
allografts may lead to post-transplantation 
dysfunction or primary non-function. None￾theless, the risk to recipients using such grafts 
remains imprecise and controversial.1-13
The guidelines for using marginal grafts 
vary from center to center. The pretransplanta￾tion liver disease status appears to be a valuable 
criterion for allocating these organs. Neverthe￾less, there is ongoing disagreement regarding 
this issue. Some authors have selected marginal 
grafts for healthier patients who can tolerate 
retransplantation, whereas others have advo￾cated their unrestricted use to meet the needs 
of transplantation lists. Thus, there is a current 
debate about the regulation and results of 
marginal liver transplantation.1-13
OBJECTIVE
The aim of this investigation was to com￾pare the effects of marginal and non-marginal 
grafts for liver transplantation at the Liver 
Transplant Division, Hospital das Clínicas 
da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade 
de São Paulo (HCFMUSP).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
In order to improve methodological 
accuracy, we included in this investigation 
103 consecutive patients who had under￾gone their fi rst liver transplantation between 
January 2001 and March 2006. Cases of 
transplantation for patients with acute liver 
failure, living donor transplantation, retrans￾plantation and sequential transplantation 
were excluded. The patient characteristics and 
liver disease diagnoses are specifi ed in Table 1. 
The procedure for liver graft recovery from 
deceased donors followed the protocol for our 
standard surgical technique.
Graft score system
We assessed graft condition quality 
using a previously described scoring sys￾tem.6,7 Briefl y, we gave a score of 1 for the 
following characteristics: donor > 60 years, 
orotracheal intubation period > 4 days, cold 
ischemia time > 13 hours, hepatic macroste￾atosis ≥ 30%, bilirubin > 2.0 mg/dl, alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) > 170 U/l and as￾partate aminotransferase (AST) > 140 U/l. 
We gave a score of 2 to the following: use 
of vasopressor drugs (dopamine > 10 mg/kg 
or any dose of noradrenalin or dobutamine) 
and serum sodium > 155 mEq/l. We consid￾ered the liver to be marginal when the score 
reached 3 (i.e. ≥ 3).
Pretransplantation
patient status
We used the validated Model for End￾Stage Liver Disease (MELD) scoring system 
to classify recipients before their transplanta￾tion, as low MELD (< 20) and high MELD 
(≥ 20).
Experimental groups
We distributed recipients into six groups: 
Group 1 – All non-marginal liver re￾cipients; Group 2 – All marginal liver 
recipients; Group 3 – Non-marginal livers 
for low-MELD recipients; Group 4 – Non￾marginal livers for high-MELD recipients; 
Group 5 – Marginal livers for low-MELD 
recipients; Group 6 – Marginal livers for

and 6. The group distribution according to 
recipient MELD score and graft characteris￾tics are presented in Table 2.
Parameters of assessment
To compare marginal and non-marginal 
recipient outcomes, we evaluated the fol￾lowing parameters: serum peaks of aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST) and alanine ami￾notransferase (ALT), one-week, one-month 
and one-year recipient survival, incidence of 
retransplantation, length of post-transplanta￾tion hospital stay and incidence of surgical 
complications (Tables 3 and 4).
Immunosuppression
The immunosuppression was based on 
tacrolimus and corticosteroids. We weaned pa￾tients off corticosteroids within three months, 
excepted in cases of transplantation due to au￾toimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis 
and primary sclerosis cholangitis, which were 
treated with corticosteroid continuously.
Statistical analysis
We used the Kaplan-Meyer test to com￾pare recipient survival, Fisher’s exact test to 
assess the incidence of surgical complications 
and retransplantation, and Student’s t test to 
evaluate the liver enzyme peak and length of 
post-transplant hospital stay. The significance 
level used was 0.05.
RESULTS
Sixty-five grafts (63.1%) were considered 
marginal and 38 (36.9%) were considered 
non-marginal (Figure 1). Overall, the non￾marginal graft recipients achieved a one-month 
survival rate of 94.7%, whereas the marginal 
graft recipients achieved 80.0% (Figure 2). 
Low-MELD recipients with non-marginal 
grafts achieved better survival rates after one 
week (93.4%) and one month (93.4%) than 
did high-MELD recipients with marginal 
livers (76.5% after one week and 64.7% after 
one month) (Figure 3). There were no differ￾ences in survival rate between marginal and 
non-marginal grafts for the other groups after 
one week, one month and one year. Therefore, 
there was no difference in survival between 
marginal and non-marginal grafts at times 
beyond the first month after transplantation. 
This finding suggests that marginal grafts 
increase the mortality rate only during the 
first month after transplantation.
There were no differences between the 
marginal and non-marginal groups regarding

the serum peaks of AST and ALT, incidence 
of retransplantation, length of post-transplant 
hospital stay and incidence of surgical com￾plications (Tables 3 and 4).
DISCUSSION
In this study, we observed higher inci￾dence of marginal donors than in most other 
centers that have assessed this subject.3,4,7 This 
may be explained in two ways: differences in 
graft grading score systems and local deficien￾cies in donor assistance.
There is no consensus regarding a grading 
system for assessing liver graft quality. Since 
these grading systems vary from center to 
center, it is reasonable to assume that some 
cases were classified in different categories 
depending on the system adopted. In the 
present report, we used a promising scoring 
system adapted from Briceño et al.7
 that had 
been valuable in a previous investigation.6
Our scoring system was practical and offered 
a convenient assessment of liver quality at 
various degrees of marginal grading.
Concerning local deficiencies, it is difficult 
to compare Brazilian organ procurement orga￾nizations with other centers that have assessed 
marginal liver transplantation, which have 
usually been located in developed countries. 
In Brazil, organ donation and recovery indexes 
remain poor. According to the 2006 edition of 
the National Transplant Register (RNT) of the 
Brazilian Organ Transplantation Association 
(ABTO),14 there were only six effective donors 
per million people per year, out of 30.6 brain 
death notifications per million people per 
year in Brazil. Furthermore, many physicians 
ignore the legislation regarding organ dona￾tion and have misunderstandings about the 
diagnosis of brain death and maintenance of 
potential donors.15,16 The deficiencies in organ 
procurement and donor assistance in Brazil 
may influence graft quality, thereby causing 
high incidence of marginal liver use.
Differing from our results, previous 
studies have not found any differences in sur￾vival between the recipients of marginal and 
non-marginal grafts. Nonetheless, they have 
demonstrated higher incidence of primary 
non-function and retransplantation among 
the recipients of marginal grafts.3-5,8-13 This 
suggests that the high mortality rate among 
marginal graft recipients in the present report 
may relate to the prolonged time that elapses 
until retransplantation can be performed in 
patients with primary non-function. The 
long time it takes to find a suitable graft for 
these critical patients may negatively affect 
the survival rate.

REFERENCES
Appropriate care for potential donors is 
a crucial step in increasing the numbers of 
organs available for transplantation. Continu￾ing medical education on organ transplanta￾tion and public debates about this topic are 
important conditions for improving organ 
donation and the quality of the recovery 
grafts.15-17 Physicians’ training in potential 
donor management allows application of 
methods including hormone replacement in 
order to avoid rapid donor deterioration.18
Furthermore, the release of accurate informa￾tion to the population about brain death and 
organ recovery following brain death affects 
decisions on whether to authorize organ 
donation.17
In this report, we observed that the first 
month after transplantation was decisive for 
defining the overall marginal graft outcome 
and recipient survival. In addition, high￾MELD recipients of marginal grafts suffered 
high mortality within the first week after trans￾plantation. This mortality would have been 
even higher if it had not been possible to per￾form retransplantation in some patients in this 
trial. Thus, if primary non-function occurs, 
prompt retransplantation is critical to save the 
recipient’s life. Unfortunately, it is impossible 
to predict accurately which grafts will fail 
during the early post-transplantation period. 
Beyond the first month after transplantation, 
the recipients of marginal and non-marginal 
grafts achieved similar outcomes.
The ideal match between recipient 
clinical status and degree of graft injury is an 
important issue in liver transplantation. We 
observed high mortality within the first month 
in cases of marginal grafts transplanted into 
high-MELD recipients. On the other hand, 
high-MELD recipients of non-marginal livers 
achieved an adequate survival rate. Thus, this 
raises the question of which patients should 
be eligible to receive a marginal liver.
Melendez and Heaton2
 pointed towards 
the idea that marginal grafts should be used 
only in clinically stable patients who can 
tolerate the possibility of retransplantation. 
Similarly, Cameron et al.13 established new 
criteria for using marginal livers and matched 
such livers with younger patients with initial 
cirrhosis and hepatocellular cancer. In order 
to expand the donor pool, they used mar￾ginal organs only in low-MELD recipients, 
and non-marginal ones in high-risk patients 
(high-MELD).
In contrast, Pokorny et al.4
 stated that 
refusal to use marginal grafts would decrease 
transplantation activity, thereby increasing 
mortality on the waiting list. These authors 
accepted any marginal graft and managed 
any early graft dysfunction by means of ag￾gressive retransplantation. This practice raises 
ethical controversy because retransplantation 
increases recipient morbidity-mortality. In 
addition, it is very difficult to predict when a 
suitable graft will become available for urgent 
retransplantation in Brazil. This situation 
may increase early mortality, thus impeding 
patients’ chances of obtaining suitable grafts.
With the aim of improving the liver trans￾plantation system, a recent Brazilian federal 
law (Federal Decree no. 1160, May 29, 2006) 
established liver graft allocations based on pa￾tients’ liver disease severity instead of the usual 
chronological system, thus following the in￾ternational trend. In this system, patients with 
higher MELD scores have priority in receiving 
liver grafts. Because of complex local situations 
regarding organ procurement, transplantation 
of marginal grafts into high-MELD recipients 
is nowadays a frequent occurrence in Brazil￾ian centers.
Our Liver Transplantation Division 
has one of the largest waiting lists for liver 
transplantation in Brazil, with more than 
800 patients. Rational use of marginal graft al￾location is frequently debated in our meetings. 
We have established a limit for transplanting 
these marginal livers. We do not proceed with 
transplanting any graft if the donor attains 
one of the following conditions: serum sodi￾um > 180 mEq/l, creatinine > 3.0 mg/dl, AST 
and/or ALT > 600 U/l, bilirubin > 3.0 mg/dl, 
donor age > 75 years and body weight < 30 kg 
or > 100 kg. We are currently analyzing our 
results from liver transplantations carried 
out over the first year of this new allocation 
system in Brazil.
Recently implemented pretransplantation 
therapeutic methods have had the aim of 
compensating for the inconvenience of organ 
shortage. Protocols combining refinements of 
liver surgery techniques and immunotherapy 
can remove complex liver tumors, thus avoid￾ing the requirement for liver transplantation.19
Furthermore, recent advances in biotechnol￾ogy have made it possible to apply hepatocyte 
transplantation as a promising and less aggres￾sive procedure for treating liver disease. This 
method has been useful for treating metabolic 
liver disease and may reduce liver transplanta￾tion waiting lists.20
CONCLUSION
Marginal grafts increase early mortality 
in liver transplantation cases, and particularly 
among high-MELD patients.

RESUMO
Enxertos marginais aumentam a mortalidade precoce no transplante de fígado
CONTEXTO E OBJETIVO: A utilização de doadores com critérios expandidos (enxertos marginais) é uma
importante solução para a carência de órgãos para transplante. No entanto, isto suscita importante
dilema ético porque esses órgãos podem aumentar a chance de insucesso do transplante. Este estudo
compara os resultados do transplante de órgãos marginais e não-marginais em 103 pacientes portadores
de doença hepática crônica.
TIPO DE ESTUDO E LOCAL: Cento e três transplantes consecutivos de fígado por doença hepática crônica
realizados no Serviço de Transplante de Fígado do Hospital das Clínicas da Faculdade de Medicina da
Universidade de São Paulo foram retrospectivamente analisados, compreendendo o período de janeiro
de 2001 a março de 2006.
MÉTODOS: A qualidade do enxerto foi calculada utilizando sistema de pontuação validado. A doença
hepática do receptor também foi classificada em MELD (Model for End-Stage Liver Disease) baixo (< 20)
e MELD alto (≥ 20). Os parâmetros avaliados na comparação entre receptores de órgãos marginais e
não-marginais foram: sobrevida do paciente em uma semana, um mês e um ano, pico sérico das enzimas
hepatocelulares, dias de internação pós-transplante e incidência de complicações cirúrgicas e retransplantes.
O índice de significância foi de 0.05.
RESULTADOS: Não houve diferença entre os grupos quanto ao tempo de internação pós-transplante, pico
sérico das enzimas hepatocelulares e incidência de complicações cirúrgicas. Em contraste, a utilização
de enxertos marginais diminuiu a sobrevida global de um mês. Os receptores de enxertos não-marginais
com baixo MELD apresentaram melhor sobrevida em uma semana e um mês do que os receptores de
enxertos marginais com alto MELD. Após o período de um mês, a taxa de sobrevida foi similar até um
ano em todos os grupos.
CONCLUSÃO: Em conclusão, o uso de enxerto marginal aumenta mortalidade precoce no transplante de
fígado, principalmente nos receptores com alto MELD.
