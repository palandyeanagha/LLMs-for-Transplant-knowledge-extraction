ABSTRACT. Objective. Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) remains challenging to treat, especially in associa￾tion with scleroderma. We examined survival rates among patients with PAH in association with
 scleroderma who received epoprostenol (Flolan®) through continuous intravenous (IV) infusion in an
uncontrolled open-label 3-year extension study following an initial randomized, controlled 12-week
study.
Methods. One hundred two patients diagnosed with PAH in association with scleroderma who received
epoprostenol were included in the analyses. This included 51 PAH patients from a subject population
of 56 who received epoprostenol in the randomized controlled study, and 46 patients from an initial
population of 55 subjects on conventional therapy in the randomized controlled study, who received
epoprostenol in the extension study. All patients in this extension study received open-label
epoprostenol. Adverse events, survival, and dosing information were collected throughout the study.
Results. The probabilities of survival during the first and second years for all subjects who received
epoprostenol during the initial randomized controlled study or during the extension study were 0.71 and
0.52, respectively. This measure remained constant at 0.48 during the third and fourth years.
Conclusion. This study reports longterm survival rates for patients with scleroderma-associated PAH
treated with IV epoprostenol. Although comparisons to historical data should be made with caution, this
study reports a better survival outcome than natural history data on patients with scleroderma-associat￾ed PAH. (First Release Sept 1 2009; J Rheumatol 2009;36:2244–9; doi:10.3899/jrheum.081277)

The World Health Organization (WHO) has classified pul￾monary hypertension into 5 groups. Group I encompasses a
group of diseases, including pulmonary arterial hypertension
(PAH) associated with connective tissue vascular disease (i.e.,
scleroderma). In these diseases, remodeling of the small pul￾monary arteries occurs due to histopathological changes that
include fibrosis, increased endothelial and medial thickness,
and plexiform lesions. PAH is characterized by a sustained
increase in the mean pulmonary arterial pressure to > 25 mm
Hg at rest, with a mean pulmonary-capillary wedge pressure
and/or left ventricular end-diastolic pressure < 15 mm Hg.
The disorder is defined further by a progressive increase in
pulmonary vascular resistance, culminating in right ventricu￾lar failure and eventually death, often by right-heart failure1-5.
Patients with scleroderma are at a higher risk of develop￾ing PAH. A recent report from a German study group revealed
a 14% occurrence rate of the disease within the scleroderma
population, which fits estimates from international data of
12% to 27%6. Other reports expand this prevalence to a range
of 4% to 38%7-11. PAH is recognized as a significant clinical

component of the scleroderma spectrum of disease8,12,13,
which encompasses systemic sclerosis, including diffuse and
limited cutaneous variants, mixed connective tissue disease,
and overlap syndrome14. Other estimates place the prevalence
of PAH at roughly 33% of diffuse cutaneous variants of sys￾temic sclerosis12, reaching up to 50% in limited scleroder￾ma8,13. While numerous disorders are observed in the spec￾trum of disease, including chronic aspiration, airway disease,
neuromuscular weakness, and pleural effusions, the most
common causes of death are PAH and interstitial lung dis￾ease15,16. Moreover, patients with PAH occurring in associa￾tion with scleroderma have a poorer outcome following ther￾apy, and a lower longterm survival rate than patients with
idiopathic PAH17.
We describe longterm survival data in patients who
received chronic intravenous (IV) epoprostenol (Flolan®),
either in an initial randomized controlled 12-week study
(third-party blind, i.e., defined as site staff performing the
6-minute walk distance (6-MWD) test were blinded to the
patients’ treatment arm) or in an uncontrolled open-label
3-year extension study designed to assess longterm safety and
survival in patients with moderate to severe PAH occurring in
association with scleroderma.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The initial trial, a North America-based multicenter, randomized controlled
study of a comparison of continuous IV epoprostenol infusion plus conven￾tional therapy to conventional therapy alone, included 111 study subjects with
functional class III or IV PAH occurring in association with scleroderma18,
with 56 patients in the former treatment group and 55 patients in the latter. For
inclusion in the initial trial, patients must have had a diagnosis of systemic
sclerosis, limited scleroderma, overlap syndrome, or definite features of the
scleroderma spectrum of disease, and moderate to severe pulmonary hyper￾tension, a ventilation/perfusion lung scan or pulmonary angiography not
indicative of thromboembolic disease, and pulmonary function tests and/or
high resolution computed tomography scanning showing not more than mild
interstitial lung disease. During the study, epoprostenol was administered
continuously through a central venous catheter with an ambulatory, posi￾tive-pressure pump (CADD-1 HFX model 5100; Sims Deltec, Inc., Saint
Paul, MN, USA). Ninety-nine patients with PAH from the initial study were
eligible for the extension study, 97 of whom consented to participate in the
extension study (Figure 1). This study population included the 51 remaining
patients from the epoprostenol plus conventional therapy treatment and 46
patients undergoing conventional therapy, who consented to participate in the
extension study. The outcome measures of the initial study were exercise
capacity as assessed by the 6-MWD, cardiopulmonary hemodynamics, signs
and symptoms of PAH and scleroderma, and survival. Significant treatment
effects were seen for 6-MWD and cardiopulmonary hemodynamics, but there
was no apparent effect on survival over the course of the 12-week study.
However, it was known in advance that the study was not adequately powered
to detect an effect on this secondary outcome measure. The majority (93%) of
the patients in the initial trial were receiving cardiovascular medications at
baseline, with 55% of patients in both treatment groups receiving furosemide.
The next most prescribed cardiovascular medications were warfarin, digoxin,
and nifedipine, used by 49%, 29%, and 22%, respectively, of patients ran￾domized to conventional therapy, and 36%, 29%, and 29%, respectively, of
patients in the epoprostenol group. More patients in the epoprostenol group
(86%) than in the conventional therapy group (67%) were receiving warfarin.
The study protocol recommended that patients in the study be maintained on
anticoagulant therapy unless a contraindication developed. Oxygen use was
constant from baseline through the study, at 68% in the epoprostenol group
and 76% in the conventional therapy group.
The extension companion study was an open-label, uncontrolled study,
designed to include all consenting subjects from the previous randomized
controlled study to either continue epoprostenol therapy, for those subjects
initially randomized to epoprostenol, or start epoprostenol therapy for coun￾terpart subjects earlier randomized to conventional therapy. Eligible patients
for this extension study were those who completed all assessments in the
 earlier study and met all inclusion and exclusion criteria for the study proto￾col. Prospective subjects for the extension study had to decide whether or not
to enroll in this extension study within 1 week following completion of the
earlier controlled study. Patients who had been randomized to receive
epoprostenol during the earlier controlled trial continued in this extension
study at their established infusion rate unless a dosage adjustment was clini￾cally warranted. Patients who received only conventional therapy during the
controlled study were started on continuous infusion of epoprostenol at 2
ng/kg/min, and dosage was increased based on tolerability. Adverse events,
survival, and dosing information were collected for all patients throughout the
study. Patients were eligible to continue receiving epoprostenol under this
protocol until they met termination criteria as shown in Table 1. Epoprostenol
was administered via a central venous catheter by ambulatory infusion pump.
Study subjects were maintained on anticoagulant therapy sufficient to main￾tain an international normalized ratio between 1.5 and 2.0, unless otherwise
contraindicated. All other medicines were allowed as deemed necessary.
Ninety-seven patients diagnosed with PAH associated with scleroderma
that received epoprostenol are included in the analyses. This population of
patients with scleroderma spectrum of disease encompasses systemic sclero￾sis with diffuse cutaneous and limited cutaneous variants, and mixed connec￾tive tissue disease. Patients enrolled in the extension open-label study are
those study subjects that survived through the initial study while receiving
epoprostenol and those on conventional therapy, which could constitute a
potential selection bias.
Analyses were based on time since first receiving epoprostenol. The sur￾vival curves for all patients were calculated using Kaplan Meier product-limit
estimates. Patients who did not die were censored at the time of withdrawal
from either study or study discontinuation. For a limited reference compari￾son, survival for historical controls was approximated using published data
from Koh, et al19.
RESULTS
The current uncontrolled open-label extension study included
a population of 102 (Figure 1) eligible patients with function￾al class III or IV PAH associated with scleroderma (Table 2),
97 of whom were enrolled. Demographically, the study popu￾lation comprised 90% women, 86% Caucasian, with a mean
age of 55 years, and 79% fitting the New York Heart
Association Class III at baseline, with 71% of patients having
been diagnosed with limited scleroderma. The median dura￾tion of PAH was 8 months and the median duration of sclero￾derma was 57 months within the study population. These fig￾ures were comparable to the 17 patients from Koh, et al, con￾sisting of 88% women, 94% Caucasian, mean age 52.5 years,
65% of whom had a diagnosis of limited scleroderma, and a
mean duration of scleroderma of 5.5 years19. Within the
enrolled subject population, 37 (36%) subjects were diag￾nosed with PAH within 6 months or less of first receiving
epoprostenol. Twenty-four (23%), 23 (23%), 11 (11%), and 7
(7%) subjects were diagnosed between 1 year to 6 months, 1
to 2 years, 2 to 5 years, and more than 5 years, respectively,
prior to receiving epoprostenol treatment (Table 3).

ures remained stable, at 0.44, during the third and fourth years
following diagnosis. Eighty-four subjects had a PAH diagno￾sis within 2 years prior to undergoing epoprostenol treatment,
and the probability of survival for these patients during the
first year post-diagnosis was 0.72 and 0.49 during the second
year. These values remained constant at 0.47 during the fourth
and fifth years. Upon consideration of the total population of
102 PAH patients eligible, 97 were enrolled to undergo
epoprostenol treatment in this extension study. In the latter
group 29 patients remained alive after 3 years and 44 deaths
occurred. Of 102 total, 28, 17, and 3 patients died during the
first, second, and third years, respectively. The probabilities of
survival during the first and second years post-diagnosis were
0.71 and 0.52, respectively. These measures remained con￾stant at 0.48 during the third and fourth years (Figure 2). The
most common cause of death was right-heart failure, involved
in 21 (22%) deaths. The remaining deaths were subsequent to
various adverse events (Table 5). None of the deaths was
judged by the investigators to be related to epoprostenol or the
drug delivery system, and most were attributable to the pro￾gression of the disease.
Four patients, 3 of whom were on conventional therapy and
one on epoprostenol during the initial trial, withdrew consent
to participate and were withdrawn from the extension study.
No specific reason for withdrawal was given by 3 patients,
while the fourth noted jaw pain and diarrhea as too uncom￾fortable to tolerate. Eighteen patients were withdrawn from
the study as a consequence of their receipt of commercially
available epoprostenol, as required per study protocol.
All 97 patients enrolled in the extension study reported at
least one adverse event. The most common adverse events
reported (by ≥ 25% of patients) during the extension study
were diarrhea, jaw pain, nausea, headache, pain, rash, flush￾ing, depression, right-heart failure, and infection. Sixty-six
patients reported at least one serious adverse event and 22
patients experienced right-heart failure, diagnosed based on
patients’ history of hospitalizations for paracentesis for mas￾sive ascites, IV diuresis and elevated jugular venous pressure,
symptomatology, and investigators’ opinion. During the
study, common adverse events attributed to the IV delivery
system included catheter-mediated sepsis and skin reaction
and hemorrhage at the injection site. Thirty patients experi￾enced at least one event leading either to decreases in the
epoprostenol infusion rate or to temporary discontinuation of
epoprostenol. Two patients, formerly on conventional thera￾py, withdrew from the study due to adverse events, including
one patient who experienced respiratory distress on the first
day of epoprostenol infusion necessitating permanent discon￾tinuation of the medication, and she died 5 days later. The
other patient became hypotensive, necessitating a decrease in
dosing; there was no improvement in blood pressure and the
patient was withdrawn permanently from the study. Data
from all 97 patients were included in the safety statistical
analysis.

DISCUSSION
In this analysis of patients with PAH occurring in association
with scleroderma participating in a multicenter uncontrolled
open-label extension study of IV epoprostenol, we report sur￾vival and serious adverse events, and provide a limited com￾parison to historical data. Taking into consideration the total
eligible subject population of 102 patients regardless of time
of PAH diagnosis, 73% of the subjects who underwent
epoprostenol treatment survived past the first year. These data
indicate, generally, a better outcome in comparison to the
report from Koh, et al19 that revealed an extremely poor prog￾nosis of approximately 50% survival rate at 1 year following
a diagnosis of PAH associated with scleroderma. Several other
studies have addressed survival in patients with PAH occur￾ring in association with scleroderma, and their findings sup￾port that this is a very challenging disease to treat20-23.
There is a paucity of data in the literature regarding the
efficacy of IV epoprostenol treatment in PAH occurring in
association with scleroderma. Our findings complement the
previously reported 12-week randomized controlled study
involving 111 PAH patients with scleroderma18. That initial
study recorded significant improvements in the 6-MWD and
hemodynamic measures, but no significant difference in sur￾vival between treatment arms18. However, it is important to
note that the initial study was not adequately powered to
detect a survival difference.
A previous 12-week study of 81 patients with severe idio￾pathic PAH, which compared conventional therapy alone to
continuous IV epoprostenol infusion therapy plus convention￾al therapy, reported improved exercise capacity, cardiopul￾monary hemodynamics, and survival24. However, available
data appear to indicate a comparatively lower rate of survival
in patients with PAH occurring in association with scleroder￾ma receiving treatment with epoprostenol than in patients
with idiopathic PAH23,25.
There are some common, widely reported side effects of
epoprostenol therapy, including headache, jaw pain, diarrhea,
nausea, rash, and musculoskeletal aches and pains18,24,26.
However, these observed side effects tend to be dose-depend￾ent, and can often be managed with dose adjustments. Equally
important is the likelihood of exacerbation of pulmonary
hypertension or even death that can result from an abrupt
interruption of the IV infusion.
There are several limitations in our current extension study.
Patients had varying time intervals from diagnosis to
epoprostenol treatment. These intersubject differences in time
from diagnosis to treatment could have had an effect on their
disease state and progression, and subsequently on the out￾come of the epoprostenol treatment during the 3-year study.
Also, per protocol, subjects who received commercially avail￾able epoprostenol were withdrawn from the study and not
included in the analysis. Moreover, the survivors from the
conventional therapy group in the randomized controlled
study proceeded to the extension companion study and
received epoprostenol treatment for the first time, which could
have engendered a subject selection bias comparative to
patients that received epoprostenol through the 2 studies.
Finally, any attempt to compare these data to historical
reports, such as that by Koh, et al19, is severely limited by
potential differences in the study populations, methods of data
