Abstract
Background: Most patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) have a ΔF508
mutation resulting in abnormal retention of mutant gene protein
(ΔF508-CFTR) within the cell. This study was undertaken to
investigate ΔF508-CFTR trafficking in native cells from patients
with CF with the aim of discovering pharmacological agents that
can move ΔF508-CFTR to its correct location in the apical cell
membrane.
Method: Nasal epithelial cells were obtained by brushing from
individuals with CF. CFTR location was determined using
immunofluorescence and confocal imaging in untreated cells and
cells treated with sildenafil. The effect of sildenafil treatment on
CFTR chloride transport function was measured in CF15 cells using
an iodide efflux assay.
Results: In most untreated CF cells ΔF508-CFTR was mislocalised
within the cell at a site close to the nucleus. Exposure of cells to
sildenafil (2 hours at 37°C) resulted in recruitment of ΔF508-CFTR
to the apical membrane and the appearance of chloride transport
activity. Sildenafil also increased ΔF508-CFTR trafficking in cells
from individuals with CF with a single copy ΔF508
(ΔF508/4016ins) or with a newly described CF trafficking mutation
(R1283M).
Conclusions: The findings provide proof of principle for sildenafil


as a ΔF508-CFTR trafficking drug and give encouragement for
future testing of sildenafil and related PDE5 inhibitors in patients
with CF.
