Immunoglobulins in chronic liver disease
TEN FEIZI
From the Department of Medicine, Royal Free Hospital, London
The association of high gamma globulin levels with
hepatic cirrhosis is well known. Since gamma
globulin levels to a great extent reflect antibody￾like protein levels, the hyperglobulinaemia in chronic
liver disease, which is associated with an increased
turnover rate (Cohen, 1963), is likely to be part of
an immunological response. Antibodies reacting with
cell nuclei (Doniach, Roitt, Walker, and Sherlock,
1966), mitochondria (Walker, Doniach, Roitt, and
Sherlock, 1965; Doniach et al., 1966), smooth
muscle (Johnson, Holborow, and Glynn, 1965),
renal glomeruli (Whittingham, Mackay, and Irwin,
1966), and biliary canaliculi (Johnson, Holborow,
and Glynn, 1966) are probably only a few of the
pathological antibodies produced in chronic liver
disease. The serum gamma globulins include the
immunoglobulin components known as IgG, IgA,
IgM (Bull. W.H.O., 1964), and IgD (Rowe and
Fahey, 1965), and methods are now available for
their distinction and measurement (Fahey and
McKelvey, 1965). These components have therefore
been studied both to observe the patterns of change
in liver disease and to ascertain if the changes might
be of diagnostic value.
Previous reports on serum immunoglobulins in
small numbers of patients with chronic liver disease
have suggested an association between high serum
IgM and primary biliary cirrhosis (Paronetto,
Schaffner, and Popper, 1964; McKelvey and Fahey,
1965; Hobbs, 1966), high serum IgA and alcoholic
cirrhosis (McKelvey and Fahey, 1965; Lee, 1965),
and depressed levels of IgG, IgA, and IgM in
Wilson's disease (McKelvey and Fahey, 1965).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
One hundred and sixteen patients with chronic liver
disease were selected from patients at the Royal Free
Hospital. Diagnosis was based on clinical, histological,
and biochemical findings, and consisted of chronic active
hepatitis (44 cases), cryptogenic cirrhosis (19), primary
biliary cirrhosis (16), alcoholic cirrhosis (14), chronic
cholestasis due to large bile duct obstruction (14),
Wilson's disease (6), and haemochromatosis (3). The
group with large bile duct obstruction consisted of
patients with obstructive jaundice of longer than four
months' duration due to biliary strictures or gallstones.
As controls, 60 healthy persons consisting of 37 blood
donors and 23 healthy members of the Royal Free
Hospital staff were studied. With the exception of two
patients (a 12-year-old child with cryptogenic cirrhosis
and a 13-year-old child with chronic active hepatitis) the
patients and the healthy persons studied were adults over
the age of 20 years. The sera had been stored at - 20C
for periods ranging from one to 18 months.
The serum immunoglobulin levels were estimated by the
immunodiffusion method (Fahey and McKelvey, 1965).
Sera and reference standards are placed in wells of equal
size in agar plates containing specific antibody against
the immunoglubulin being estimated. After incubation
a precipitin ring is formed round each well, the diameter
of which is related to the immunoglobulin concentration.
A standard curve is drawn by plotting precipitin ring
diameters of the standard solutions (on an arithmetic
scale) against their concentration (on a logarithmic scale).
The immunoglobulin levels in the test sera are determined
by reference to the standard curve.
IgG, IgA, and IgM levels were estimated using im￾munoplates and standards prepared by Hyland labora￾tories and were expressed as mg/100 ml. The same
standards were used for estimations in healthy persons
and in patients with liver disease. The reproduceability
of the immunoglobulin determinations was assessed by
performing six separate determinations of a single serum.
The maximum deviation occurring with IgG determina￾tions was 23 %; with IgA and IgM the respective figures
were 18% and 14%.
Specific antiserum and standards for the measurement
of IgD levels in patients with liver disease were provided
by Dr. D. S. Rowe. Serum IgD levels were expressed as a
percentage of a standard serum of high IgD content.
RESULTS
IMMUNOGLOBULINS IN HEALTHY PERSONS Serum IgG
levels ranged between 1,000 and 2,700 mg/100 ml
(mean 1,700 mg/100 ml). IgA levels were between 57
and 780 mg/100 ml (mean 334 mg/100 ml) and IgM
levels were between 25 and 180 mg/100 ml (mean
75 mg/100 ml) as shown in Figure 1. Serum IgD
findings in helathy persons were provided by Dr.
D. S. Rowe (Fig. 2).

IgM elevations occurred not only among patients
with primary biliary cirrhosis but among each of the
-mean seven diagnostic groups (Fig. 5).
A quarter of the patients with primary biliary
cirrhosis (four out of 16) had IgM levels within the
100Oml] normal range. In primary biliary cirrhosis IgM levels
- . did not correlate with duration of illness (Fig. 6).
There was a similar incidence of rises of IgG, IgA,
* * and IgM found in chronic active hepatitis and
cryptogenic cirrhosis (Fig. 7). The remaining three
groups had differing patterns. The highest levels for
IgG were in patients with chronic active hepatitis and
.*. cryptogenic cirrhosis, occurring in 64% and 630%
respectively. Serum IgA was most commonly
... elevated in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. The
highest levels for IgM were in the primary biliary
- cirrhosis group, although the alcoholic cirrhotics
did not fall far short: 81 % of patients with primary
... S* .biliary cirrhosis had elevated IgM levels, as also did
700% of alcoholic cirrhotics. Twenty-one per cent of
0.000 patients with chronic large bile duct obstruction
f resembled patients with primary biliary cirrhosis in

Immunoglobulins in chronic liver disease
TABLE ll commonest immunoglobulin change observed in the
IMMUNOGLOBULIN PATTERNS IN WILSONS' DISEASE AND IN present study was elevation of serum IgM (Table II).
HAEMOCHROMATOSIS The similarity in the patterns of immunoglobulin
IgG /gA 1gM No. of Patients change in chronic active hepatitis and cryptogenic
cirrhosis is striking, and may represent a response to
Wilson's disease (6patiethe same or similar antigenic stimuli in the two
-+t- + l diseases. The distinction between the two condi￾tions, based on the total serum gamma globulin
level and the degree of plasma cell infiltration and
Haemochromatosis (3 patients) cell necrosis in the liver biopsy, can sometimes be
-_ 2 difficult; these criteria may merely be separating
individuals with differing degrees of immunological
response. Many patients with chronic active hepatitis
hronic active hepatitis (2), cryptogenic cirrhosis (2), ultimately develop cirrhosis. These observations
and Wilson's disease (2). suggest that cryptogenic cirrhosis might be the late
stage of a subclinical chronic active hepatitis.
DISCUSSION Markedly raised immunoglobulin levels were
observed among some patients receiving prednisone,
The normal range for IgG and IgA ls considerably the dosage of which ranged between 5 and 30 mg
higher than that in two other published series per day (Figs. 3, 4, and 5). Many of these patients
(Fahey and McKelvey, 1965; Stiehm and Fudenberg, had higher total gamma globulin levels before the
1966), whereas the range for IgM is in reasonable initiation of steroid therapy. Therefore, it is possible
agreement with them. The discrepancy is explained that their immunoglobulin levels had been reduced to
by differences in reference (standard) sera, so in some extent by steroid therapy.
order to have a valid comparison between healthy
persons and the patients the same standards were
used throughout this survey.
No single immunoglobulin pattern was diagnostic
of any of the seven chronic liver diseases studied.
It may be difficult to diagnose chronic large bile
duct obstruction and primary biliary cirrhosis; in
the former surgical intervention is indicated whereas
in the latter it is contraindicated. On the basis of
serum IgM rises in primary biliary cirrhosis, it has
been suggested that serum IgM levels might make
the distinction from chronic bile duct obstruction
(Hobbs, 1966), but the finding of normal IgM
levels in 19% of patients with primary biliary
cirrhosis and of raised IgM levels in 21 % of patients
with chronic large bile duct obstruction makes the
serum IgM level a much less reliable criterion than
the mitochondrial antibody test (Walker et al., 1965;
Doniach et al., 1966). Paronetto et al. (1964) also
recorded high macroglobulin levels in nine cases of
primary biliary cirrhosis (one of them had a normal
level at the time of initial testing) and in three out of
seven patients with secondary biliary cirrhosis. The
high incidence of IgA elevation in alcoholic cirrhosis
has been confirmed but elevation was not uncommon
in other chronic liver diseases and this reduced its
value as a diagnostic test.
Serum immunoglobulin levels were not reduced
in patients with Wilson's disease involving the liver.
The numbers tested, however, were small. Patients
with Wilson's disease may have very high total
serum gamma globulins (Sherlock, 1966), and the
SUMMARY
Using the immunodiffusion method the serum levels
of immunoglobulins IgG, IgA, IgM, and IgD were
determined in 116 patients with a variety of chronic
liver diseases. The main groups were chronic active
hepatitis, cryptogenic cirrhosis, alcoholic cirrhosis,
primary biliary cirrhosis, and chronic obstructive
jaundice due to biliary strictures or stones. A small
group of patients with haemochromatosis and
Wilson's disease were included.
Markedly raised levels of IgG, IgA, and IgM
were observed among patients in almost all the
diagnostic groups.
Serum IgG levels were raised most commonly in
active chronic hepatitis and cryptogenic cirrhosis,
occurring in 64% and in 63% respectively; in the
three other main groups they were elevated in
20 to 46% of cases. Forty-six per cent of patients
with cirrhosis of the alcoholic had elevated IgA
levels but they were high in 15 to 36 % of the other
groups of patients. A very high incidence (81 %) of
raised IgM levels was found in patients with primary
biliary cirrhosis and in patients with cirrhosis of the
alcoholic 70 % had high IgM levels. In the remaining
groups high levels of IgM were observed in 21 to
56 % of patients.
High levels of IgD were observed in two out of
44 patients with active chronic hepatitis, two out of
19 with cryptogenic cirrhosis, and in two out of six
with Wilson's disease.
