Background: The impact of de novo anti-HLA donor-specific alloantibodies (DSA) which
develop after long-term liver transplantation (LT) remains controversial and unclear. The
aim of this study was to investigate the role of de novo DSAs on the outcome in LT.
Methods: We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies
published until Dec 31, 2019, that reported de novo DSA outcome data (≥1 year of
follow-up) after liver transplant. A literature search in the MEDLINE/PubMed,
EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Scopus and Web of Science Core Collection
databases was performed.
Results: Of 5,325 studies identified, 15 fulfilled our inclusion criteria. The studies which
reported 2016 liver transplant recipients with de novo DSAs showed an increased
complication risk, i.e. graft loss and chronic rejection (OR 3.61; 95% CI 1.94–6.71, P <
0.001; I2 58.19%), and allograft rejection alone (OR 6.43; 95% CI: 3.17–13.04; P < 0.001;
I
2 49.77%); they were compared to patients without de novo DSAs. The association
between de novo DSAs and overall outcome failure was consistent across all subgroups
and sensitivity analysis.
Conclusions: Our study suggested that de novo DSAs had a significant deleterious
impact on the liver transplant risk of rejection. The routine detection of de novo DSAs may
be beneficial as noninvasive biomarker-guided risk stratification.

INTRODUCTION
The damaging effect of alloantibodies against donor HLA has been widely known in all solid organ
transplantation, except the liver (1, 2). It is clearly documented that developing de novo donor
specific antibodies (dn-DSA) has a pathogenic role in solid organ allografts such as the kidney (3),
lung (4), heart (5), pancreas (6), and intestine (7). dn-DSAs are associated with late acute antibody

mediated rejection and chronic antibody-mediated rejection,
which can have effects on the long survival (8–10).
Since the early 1990s, the liver has been known as an
immunologically resistant organ to rejection in transplantation
(11). The cause of this resistance was considered because of the
great ability of the liver to absorb or neutralize alloantibodies
directed against HLA antigens (12). In liver transplant (LT)
recipients, the first reports failed to reveal an association between
dn-DSAs and graft rejection or survival (13–15). Nowadays,
improved understanding of the humoral response in solid organ
transplants has been greatly increased by new sensitive, high￾throughput, and cutting-edge facilities in antibody detection (13,
16–19). Therefore, further reports demonstrate that LT recipients
who develop dn-DSA reveal lower graft and patient survival (20,
21). Furthermore, the latest studies suggested the possible impact
of dn-DSA and the humoral response as a risk factor for
unexplained post-operative complications such as biliary
problems, acute and chronic rejection, and patient survival,
especially in deceased-donor liver transplantation (DDLT)
compared to living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) (22–27).
In LT, the above outcomes are often observed in biopsies from
pediatric or adult patients, and the severity of worse outcome
correlates with the timing from LT to applying the biopsy
procedure and follow up (28). Nevertheless, uncertainty about
the role of dn-DSAs after liver transplantation in humoral response
still exists, and dn-DSA monitoring has not been universally
adopted by all transplant centers in LT recipients (27, 29).
Consequently, the main question of our study is “Is dn-DSA
important and effective in long term liver injury in LT patients?”
To date, few studies have assessed the incidence and effect of dn￾DSA on liver-transplant patients. Because of the lack of
consensus on this topic, the aim of this systematic review and
meta-analysis was to evaluate the role of dn-DSAs on the graft
outcome in long-term LT recipients. The primary outcome
measures the overall graft loss and chronic rejection results.
Secondary outcomes included the estimated graft loss and
chronic rejection separately. Subgroup and sensitivity analysis
of the main outcomes were stratified.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This systematic review and meta-analysis was carried out according
to the recommendations by the Cochrane Collaboration, the
PRISMA statement and Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in
Epidemiology guidelines (30–32). This study is registered with
PROSPERO, number CRD42020172054.
Data Sources and Search Strategy
Two reviewers (ZBe and SK) conducted a systematic literature
search independently in the MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE,
Cochrane Library, Scopus and Web of Science Core Collection
databases with no time and language restrictions up to Dec 31,
2019. Bibliography of the selected articles on the topic and other
relevant systematic reviews were manually searched for
additional studies and for minimizing the publication bias. The
search strategy was designed using controlled keywords and the
MeSH terms (Medical Subject Heading). One word (keywords)
was identified by examining relevant references in the literature
and the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) used by a specialist
librarian (SK) who has extensive experience in systematic
reviews from EMBASE and MEDLINE (http://www.nlm.nih.
gov/mesh/). The following main key search terms were used
for database search: “liver transplantation”, “donor specific anti￾HLA antibodies”, “anti-HLA DSAs”, “human leukocyte antigen”,
“solid phase assay”, “outcome”, “graft loss”, “graft survival”, and
“rejection”. To do it comprehensively, we also reviewed all
references of full-text articles to find relevant studies, which
might have been missed in our search strategy. See Table S1 for
the full search strategy.
Study Selection and Criteria
At first, studies of any relevant design and in any language on the
impact of dn-DSA and/or complement-activating anti-HLA
DSAs on long-term graft outcome in both adult and pediatric
patients were selected. The inclusion criteria were as follows:
(1) All articles designed to assess the association of dn-DSA
with allograft outcomes (protocol DSA screening); (2) The
patients being screened for dn-DSA at least one time on the
day of transplantation (Day 0) and another screening after
LT; (3) Studies reporting positive and negative dn-DSA liver
transplant with/or without outcome after LT; (4) If a non dn￾DSA control group was included, it reported dn-DSA with/or
without outcome after LT; (5) The outcome should be graft loss
and/or graft rejection in LT; (6) The long-term follow-up post￾transplantation in studies was considered, which should be more
than 1 year; (7) All articles just reporting dn-DSA detection by
the Luminex single-antigen bead (SAB) technique (33, 34); and
(8) Graft rejection was confirmed by liver biopsy (35).
Exclusion criteria were: (1) Case reports, editorials, reviews,
and letters, animal studies, conference papers, non-liver solid
organ transplant studies; (2) Combined transplanted patients, re￾transplanted patients or second liver transplant cases; (3) Articles
not exactly determining which of these cases was dn-DSA or
performed DSA; and (4) Articles just reporting T-cell-mediated
rejection. If multiple papers reported on similar patients from
one center, the most complete publication was chosen for
advanced synthesis and another one was excluded unless they
were different in data.
The corresponding author of each suspected study was asked
to verify dn-DSA detection when these were not available on the
manuscript. We sent two separate reminders unless we obtained
a certain answer. When no reply was received, the study was
excluded from the analysis.
Two authors (ZBe and BG) independently assessed the
potential eligibility of the articles in two stages: screening of
titles and abstracts and screening of full-text articles using the
eligibility criteria, as described above. The selected studies were

fully read by both reviewers and those which fulfilled the
eligibility criteria were selected for detailed data mining and
quality assessment. Inter-rater reliability (kappa statistic) was
calculated using the MedCalc software 19.1. Disagreements at
both stages were resolved by consensus and referred back to the
original article.
Data Extraction and Quality Assessment
Two reviewers (ZBe and BG) extracted the data; ZBe extracted
data from the articles and BG rechecked them for accuracy. The
collected data included the first author’s name; publication year;
sample size; design of the study; period of inclusion; median time
of the last biopsy to analysis dn-DSA; mean patient follow-up
time post-LT; type of organ donation; ABO blood type; potential
confounding factors; population and center characteristics;
etiology of liver disease; recipient Model for End-Stage Liver
Disease (MELD) or Child-Pugh score at transplant; positive dn￾DSA patients with outcome (rejection, graft loss); positive dn￾DSA patients without outcome (rejection, graft loss); negative
dn-DSA patients with outcome (rejection, graft loss); negative
dn-DSA patients without outcome (rejection, graft loss); MFI
value; and the outcome of graft loss or/and graft rejection. The
raw data were extracted using binary analysis.
For quality assessment, the Newcastle-Ottawa scale assessed
the quality of the studies for both cohort and case-control
studies. The quality can be given eight stars in the Selection
(up to 4 stars), Comparability (1 star) and Outcome (up to 3
stars) categories. Articles could receive one additional star from
comparability if they analyzed not only dn-DSA, but also
complement-activating donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies.
Therefore, the maximum star could be nine stars. The two
authors (ZBe, BG) independently scored the publications, and
disagreement was resolved by discussion and consensus.
Meanwhile, as all the included articles were observational
studies, the context and population were also considered. See
Table S2 regarding the NOS scoring system.
Data Synthesis and Statistical Analysis
In the present study, meta-analysis was performed based on
random effect models in order to control the between-study
heterogeneity and within-study heterogeneity. In the first step,
we considered all eligible studies in the analysis for rejection
outcome and graft loss. The rate of rejection and/or graft loss was
compared between positive dn-DSA patients with LT and
negative dn-DSA ones based on odds ratio. Publication bias
was visually assessed using a funnel plot. In addition,
heterogeneity was tested using Q Cochran heterogeneity test
and I2 index was reported for measuring the degree of
heterogeneity. This index provides information regarding the
percentage of total variation across different studies due to
heterogeneity rather than chance. A value of 0% indicates no
observed heterogeneity; values greater than 50% indicate high
heterogeneity and consequently considerable caution should be
considered in interpreting the results. We reported odds ratio
with 95% confidence interval as a binary outcome data in all
cases. The statistical analysis was performed by RevMan
software, version 5.1 and MedCalc software 19.1.
SUBGROUP AND SENSITIVITY ANALYSES
These analyses were conducted in different subgroups in order to
consider different sources of heterogeneity regarding the primary
outcome. The following subgroup analyses were considered:
adult vs. pediatric, living vs. deceased donors, duration of
follow-up post-transplantation, type of biopsy, potential
confounding factors, cutoff MFI comparison, and highly
methodological quality studies. The center effect was also
studied based on the exclusion of the larger studies.
RESULTS
Study Identification and Characteristics
The electronic search identified 5,325 potentially relevant citations.
The 225 full-text articles were found for possible eligibility with
regard to the inclusion criteria. Finally, 15 studies and 2016 patients
were included in the final systematic review and meta-analysis,
including 5 studies with data on the allograft loss (36–40), and 10
studies with data on rejection (41–50). Aflow diagram of the article
selection process is demonstrated in Figure 1. All studies had a
Newcastle-Ottawa Scale score of 6 or more, as shown in Table 1
and detailed Table S2. The Kappa statistics for the study eligibility
was 0.93 between the two reviewers (SE = 0.09). Table 1
summarizes the characteristics of the included studies.
Overall, 7 (46.7%) studies originated from Europe, 5 (33.3%),
from USA, and 3 (20.0%) from Japan. All studies had collected
patients between Jan 20, 1985, and Dec 1, 2017 and none of them
included patients with combined transplantation. Of these, 4
studies had reported pediatric liver transplant and 11 studies
were on adult recipients. The number of pediatric and adult
recipients of liver transplant were 151 and 1,865 for the included
studies. The mean age of the pediatric and adult participants was
4.52 and 48.23 years, respectively. Seven studies had reported the
transplant type (living donor vs. deceased donor) which were
received from 237 living donors, and 546 deceased donors; 1,233
of them had not reported the donor type. The mean patient follow￾up period post-transplantation was 5.71 years. In addition, the
mean period from LT to DSA evaluation and latest liver biopsy was
33 months. Complement activating alongside the dn-DSA was also
reported by their capacity to bind to C1q (4 studies), C3d (4
studies), and by their IgG subclass composition (2 studies). Model
for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score had been reported in 5
studies with a median of 19.
None of the studies included was sponsored or conducted by
diagnostic companies involved in detection of antibodies by solid
phase assay. Nine corresponding authors of the articles were
contacted and asked for more Supplementary Data, and 5 of
them provided the requested information.
Outcomes
Overall, DSA was analyzed in 2016 liver transplants. A total
number of 358 patients were found to have dn-DSA, 142 of
whom were positive dn-DSA with overall outcome (rejection,
graft loss); 216 patients were positive dn-DSA without outcome.
A total number of 1,658 were found to have no dn-DSA, 247 of

whom were negative dn-DSA patients with outcome; 1,411
patients were negative dn-DSA patients without outcome.
De Novo Donor Specific Anti-HLA DSA Status and
Overall Outcome
The odds ratio (OR) of the outcome (graft loss or rejection) was
3.61 (95% CI, 1.94–6.71, P < 0.001; I2 58.19%) for the dn-DSA￾positive patients, which implies a 3.61 times higher graft loss or
rejection on long term outcome compared to the dn-DSA-negative
patients (Figure 2). The result was statistically significant.
Risk of Allograft Loss According to De Novo Donor
Specific Anti-HLA DSA Status
Five studies (1,254 patients) were included in the analysis of
allograft loss. The odds ratio of the allograft loss was 1.28 (95%
CI 0.83–1.96; P = 0.26) for the DSA-positive patients, compared
to the DSA-negative patients (Figure 3A). The result was
statistically insignificant. The heterogeneity of the literatures
was low (I2 0.00%); therefore, there was no possibility of a
publication bias.
Risk of Rejection According to De Novo Donor
Specific Anti-HLA DSA Status
Ten studies (762 patients) were included in the analyses of rejection.
The odds ratio of rejection was 6.43 (95% CI 3.17–13.04; P < 0.001)
for the DSA-positive patients, compared to the DSA-negative
patients (Figure 3B). The result indicated that dn-DSA positive
patients had a 6.43 times higher rejection on long-term outcome
compared to the dn-DSA-negative patients. The result was
statistically significant. The heterogeneity of the literature was low
(I2 49.77%), and there was no possibility of publication bias.
Subgroup and Sensitivity Analyses
Subgroup analyses were performed on the overall outcome to
confirm the consistency of the results and explain some of the
heterogeneity found in the main results. Summaries of all
different effect sizes for different subgroup analyses are
presented in Table 2.
Effect of dn-DSA According to Adult or Pediatric
Patients
Sensitivity analysis restricted to studies with pediatric patients
(4 studies; 151 patients) was used to demonstrate consistent
results regarding the association between dn-DSA positive and
overall outcome with an increased OR to 10.20 as compared to
patients with negative dn-DSA (95% CI 4.65–22.33; P < 0.001; I2
38.81%) (Figure S1). In addition, the heterogeneity across the
studies decreased from 58.19 to 38.81%. Eleven studies (1,865
adult patients) were included in the sub-analysis of the overall

outcome, which did not differ much from the overall results (OR
2.57; 95% CI 1.38–4.76; P = 0.00; I2 51.81%) (Figure S2).
Effect of dn-DSA According to the Type of Organ
Donation
We performed a stratified sensitivity analysis according to the
donor type of LT patients for detection of dn-DSA. We found out
that patients with LDLT and positive dn-DSA (4 studies, 237
patients) showed increased OR to 15.44 (95% CI 6.32–37.74; P <
0.001; I2 0.00%) significantly (Figure S3). Hence, 5 studies (614
patients) with the DDLT patients were analyzed with decreased
OR from the overall results (OR 1.75; 95% CI 0.76–4.02; P = 0.19;
I
2 33.79%) (Figure S4).
Effect of dn-DSA According to the Duration of Follow
Up Post-Transplantation
Sensitivity analysis restricted to studies (4 studies; 408 patients)
with follow up time ≤3 years indicated results regarding the
association between positive dn-DSA and the risk of long-term
overall outcome, with a pooled OR of 2.97 (95% CI 1.52–5.78;
P = 0.00; I2 0.00%), and the heterogeneity across the studies
decreased from 58.19 to 0.00% (Figure S5). Sensitivity analysis

restricted to studies (4 studies; 905 patients) with the follow up
duration of 5 years demonstrated consistent results regarding the
association between positive dn-DSA and the risk of overall
outcome, with an increased OR of 3.64 (95% CI 1.43–9.33; P =
0.00; I2 54.33) (Figure S6). Sensitivity analysis restricted to
studies (7 studies; 703 patients) with the follow up time of >5
years demonstrated consistent results regarding the association
between positive dn-DSA and the risk of long-term overall
outcome, with an increased OR of 3.90 (95% CI 0.93–14.86;
P = 0.05; I2 81.21) (Figure S7).
Effect of dn-DSA According to Cutoff MFI Value
We performed a stratified sensitivity analysis according to the
cutoff MFI value for detection of dn-DSA. It was confirmed that
patients with cutoff MFI value lower than 3,000 (OR 4.28; 95% CI
1.96–9.31; P < 0.00; I2 59.25%) positive dn-DSA were
significantly associated with an increased risk of overall
outcome (Figure S8). However, in patients with the cutoff MFI
value higher than 3,000 (OR 2.43; 95% CI 0.75–7.83; P = 0.13;
I
2 61.43%) positive dn-DSA remained insignificant (Figure S9).
Effect of dn-DSA According to the Type of Biopsy
We performed a stratified sensitivity analysis according to
detection of patient by protocol biopsy or indication. It was
confirmed that in patients with either protocol (OR 3.55; 95% CI
1.40–9.02, P = 0.00; I2 51.75%) or indication (OR 3.71; 95% CI
1.75–7.79; P = 0.00; I2 37.00%) biopsy, dn-DSAs remained
significantly associated with an increased risk of overall
outcome (Figures S10, S11).
Effect of dn-DSA According to the Confounding
Factors
Primary analyses were stratified sensitivity analysis according to
the lack of any confounding factors such as CMV, viral disease,
technical problem, etc. In 8 studies, we found consistent
associations between dn-DSA production and risk of the
overall outcome in patients without confounding variables (OR
5.11; 95% CI 1.70–15.33; P = 0.00; I2 57.37%) (Figure S12).
Effect of dn-DSA in Studies With High
Methodological Quality
Sensitivity analysis restricted to studies with high methodological
quality (NOS score > 7) demonstrated consistent results
regarding the association between dn-DSA and the risk of a
long-term outcome (OR 3.53; 95% CI 1.77–7.07; P < 0.001;
I
2 46.11) (Figure S13).
Center Effect
After removing the 5 largest cohort studies (in terms of the
number of patients included) from the analysis (37, 39, 42, 45,
48), the presence of dn-DSA remained significantly associated
with an increased risk of an outcome (OR 4.44; 95% CI 1.93–
10.21; P < 0.001), and the heterogeneity across the studies
decreased from 58.19 to 52.33% (Figure S14).
DISCUSSION
The humoral immune system is a significant barrier to solid
organ transplantation due to antibodies against non-self-proteins
expressed on transplanted organs (51, 52). In the majority of liver
transplant programs, the liver is transplanted without cross￾match results (53–58) because it is believed that the liver is
tolerant to humoral response (antibody mediated rejection).
Recent studies demonstrated that a positive cross-match could
increase the risk of early graft loss in liver transplanted patients
which can be induced by circulating DSAs (59–62). However, it
seems that DSAs are one of the essential parts of tolerance
development (63, 64). Since consistent results are lacking, clinical
practice has not been significantly changed (65). Therefore, the
meta-analysis, as an innovative, quantitative statistical method
for medical assessment, might be used for clarification when
controversy persists.
This is the first systematic review and meta-analysis in the
available literature which investigated the role of dn-DSAs on the
graft outcome in LT recipients. In the present meta-analysis, we
included 15 studies, with 2016 patients from the USA, Europe,

and Japan. The statistical analysis reveals the association of the
dn-DSA with long-term outcome in LT recipients. In addition to
the overall outcome, we found that dn-DSA was strongly
associated with an increased risk of graft rejection without a
significant publication bias and with acceptable heterogeneity. As
to rejection, dn-DSA positive patients had a 6.43 times higher
rejection rate in the long-term follow up compared to the dn￾DSA-negative patient. These results may enhance the validity of
the findings and their applicability in various therapeutic
applications, and transplant programs with different practices,
and also support the possibility of a causal effect between dn￾DSA and allograft outcome. It is worth mentioning that not all
dn-DSA classes are equal in terms of pathogenicity; therefore,
they might be associated with different adverse allograft
outcomes. In view of the fact that activation of dn-DSA along
with complement cascade is a major component of AMR
process, new investigations have been useful for better
understanding of the role of DSAs and pathophysiology of
transplant allograft outcome (66).
The findings of this meta-analysis were confirmed by
different subgroup analyses. First, even though adult LT
patients were the highest number of patients included in the
present meta-analysis, the effects of dn- DSAs on the allograft
outcome remained significant in pediatric LT patients with an
increase of 10.20 times compared to patients with negative dn￾DSA. Second, the LDLT leads to dn-DSA and higher adverse
effects on the allograft outcome compared to DDLT. It should be
mentioned that due to small number of studies and low sample
size in each study, the confidence interval is very wide. Hence,
the results should be interpreted with caution and may not be
reliable. Third, the same effect was observed regardless of the
follow-up duration after transplantation. Fourth, we found
similar associations regardless of the lower cutoff MFI value
(MFI < 3,000), not high ones (MFI ≥ 3,000). To note, the low
range cutoff was the same in all studies, which was 1,000 MFI;
however, the result of the MFI ≥3,000 value was insignificant
which might be due to different ranges from 3,000–5,000 MFI
value between studies. These different cutoffs MFI and technical
issues in dn-DSA detection is out of the scope of the
present study.
Additionally, our sub-analysis clearly shows that not only
protocoled biopsy, but also induction biopsy have the same effect
of dn-DSA on the outcome. Indeed, we analyzed the effect of dn￾DSA according to the potential of confounding factors such as
CMV, viral disease, technical problem, etc., which might also
lead to dn-DSA production due to alloantigen exposure. As to
the factors associated with DSA, it was reported that CMV
infection was correlated with AMR, chronic rejection, and
allograft dysfunction in liver transplant (36). Our finding in
studies without confounding factors suggests a strong
relationship between independent production of dn-DSA and
outcome. Despite this overall heterogeneity, when sensitivity
analyses were performed including studies with high
methodological quality, the heterogeneity decreased from 58.19
to 46.11%. Finally, we performed the center effect on the analysis
because larger studies might be an effective factor for the finding
associations in primary analyses and could change the
overall heterogeneity.
Based on the subgroup analysis, non-optimal statistical power
and statistical methodologies used in the studies might elucidate
the heterogeneity (I2
) distinguished in our study. Despite the
overall heterogeneity, when the above-mentioned subgroup
analyses were performed, the heterogeneity decreased from
58.19% in some sub-analyses. Therefore, the association
between dn-DSA and allograft outcome remained significant in
different transplant populations, types of organ donation,
duration of follow up post-transplantation, high quality
mythological studies, and the center effect, thereby reinforcing
the study conclusions. However, further research is needed
because of low number of studies and heterogeneity higher
than 50%.
The results of the present investigation might have an
important clinical implication. The overall association
represented in this study could increase the validity of using
dn-DSAs as a potential prognostic factor in allograft rejection of
LT patients. It is known that one of the main problems to
improve and develop the overall LT patient outcomes is the lack
of reliable, well-informed, and noninvasive biomarkers to predict
the allograft outcomes (66). As a result, knowledgeable
biomarker such as a dn-DSA can be used for classification of
the patients’ outcome, allograft risk, clinical trial design, and as
marker endpoints. Accordingly, monitoring of dn-DSA
continuously after LT might take steps toward improving liver
transplantation by performing necessary action at the right time
such as a maximization/minimization immunosuppression (IS)
or IS withdrawal eligibility.
According to the literature data, the presence of DSA is
associated with post-LT complications including de novo
autoimmune hepatitis, ductopenia, biliary strictures,
accelerated fibrosis, refractory thrombocytopenia and acute
liver injury, which can induce combined acute antibody￾mediated rejection (AMR), and T-cell-mediated rejection (18,
67). DSA positivity and high MFI are indicative of AMR, which
needs more aggressive immunosuppression and according to
BANFF classification, positive DSA is mandatory for the
diagnosis of AMR (68). Accordingly, characterization of dn￾DSAs may also have therapeutic significance, providing
opportunities for the treatment and decision for immune
suppression (IS) and minimization of specific drugs targeting.
It may also help to find out the reason for immunosuppressive
treatment and switch the therapy to more aggressive
immunosuppression such as plasmapheresis.
This study had some limitations: we first acknowledge the
higher population of adult patients compared to pediatric liver
transplant patients. We also acknowledge that fewer studies
regarding allograft loss were included. Further studies are
required to quantify the value of the effect of dn-DSA on the
risk of allograft loss. Third, the exact time of dn-DSA detection
could not be addressed because the articles included in the meta￾analysis did not report them. Fourth, no data were available from
Australian, Asian or South American LT populations, which can
restrict the extrapolation of our findings to these patient

populations. Fifth, differences in the patients’ characteristics that
might have an effect on transplantation outcomes, such as donor
age, primary diseases, and immunosuppression maintenance,
were not reported in most of the studies. Indeed, the difference
between the males and females and different etiologies cannot be
assessed given the lack of available data. Finally, almost all the
included studies were observational and retrospective, so
unknown confounding factors may elucidate a part of the
residual heterogeneity observed.
In conclusion, the results of this meta-analysis on circulating
dn-DSAs demonstrate a significant determinant of long-term
allograft outcome in liver transplant rejection, and consideration
might be given to a feasible, valuable prognostic biomarker for
enhancement of the risk stratification for liver allograft outcome.
Our results may encourage the clinicians, health care providers,
and health policy makers to monitor dn-DSA in LT recipients.
