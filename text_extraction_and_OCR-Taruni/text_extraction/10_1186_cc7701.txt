Abstract
Critical care physicians are increasingly facing patients receiving
oral anticoagulation for either cessation of major haemorrhage or to
reverse the effects of vitamin K antagonists ahead of emergency
surgery. Rapid reversal of anticoagulation is particularly essential in
cases of life-threatening bleeding. In these situations, guidelines
recommend the concomitant administration of prothrombin complex
concentrates (PCCs) and oral or intravenous vitamin K for the
fastest normalisation of the international normalised ratio (INR).
Despite their universal recommendation, PCCs remain underused
by many physicians who prefer to opt for fresh frozen plasma
despite its limitations in anticoagulant reversal, including time to
reverse INR and high risk of transfusion-related acute lung injury. In
contrast, the lower volume required to normalise INR with PCCs
and the room temperature storage facilitate faster preparation and
administration time, thus increasing the speed at which haemor￾rhages can be treated. PCCs therefore allow faster, more reliable
and complete reversal of vitamin K anticoagulation, especially when
administered immediately following confirmation of haemorrhage. In
the emergency setting, probabilistic dosing may be considered.
Introduction
Since the introduction of oral anticoagulants over 50 years
ago, there has been a dramatic increase in their use in the
developed world due to their high success in preventing
thromboembolic events. In fact, 0.8% to 2.0% of the
population in these countries receives oral anticoagulation
therapy with the vitamin K antagonists warfarin, aceno￾coumarol, fluinidone or phenprocoumon [1,2]. The most
common indication for the use of vitamin K antagonists is
atrial fibrillation, but they are also widely used to prevent a
range of other thromboembolic complications, such as deep
vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolisms and strokes from
mechanical heart valves [3].
Oral anticoagulation therapy carries the inherent risk of
haemorrhagic complications. Many patients receiving vitamin
K antagonists have an international normalised ratio (INR)
higher than the target of 2.0 to 3.0 for over 50% of the time
[3,4], increasing their risk of bleeding; those with an INR
within the therapeutic range may still be at risk. A rate of
major haemorrhage of 7.2 per 100 person-years was repor￾ted in the United States, with most events occurring in
patients aged over 80 years (Figure 1) [5]. Major bleeding
can occur at a number of sites, with gastrointestinal and
urinary tract bleeds the most frequently observed, affecting
approximately 1% to 4% of patients being treated with
vitamin K antagonists per year [6,7]. Intracranial haemorrhage
(ICH) is less common, with reported annual risk ranging
between 0.25% and 1% among patients receiving vitamin K
antagonists [8-11]; however, it is the most life-threatening of
bleeds and is associated with a high mortality rate [6,7]. This
review highlights the clinical need for emergency reversal of
anticoagulation in the critical care setting and outlines the
available treatment options.
The need for anticoagulant reversal in a
bleeding emergency
Emergency reversal of vitamin K antagonists is often neces￾sary in the critical care setting and many guidelines recom￾mend rapid reversal as soon as diagnosis of haemorrhage is
confirmed in cases of life-threatening bleeding, major trauma
or specific haematoma localisations (Table 1). Reversal should
normalise coagulation as quickly as possible to reduce blood
loss, and consequently improve prognosis in terms of both
morbidity and mortality. Moreover, in patients without
haemorrhage, rapid anticoagulant reversal may be required
prior to immediate emergency surgery (Table 1) [12].
Severe haemorrhage may be diagnosed either by the level of
vital signs (for example, shock) or by the localisation of the
bleed - for example, intracranial haemorrhage is defined as a

bleeding emergency (Table 1). Anticoagulant-induced ICHs
are larger than non-anticoagulant-induced events, carry a
higher risk of mortality (44% to 68% at 1 to 6 months), and
occur more frequently [13]. The progression of events in
patients with anticoagulant-induced ICH generally takes
around 24 hours, with increasing neurological deterioration
observed in the first 24 to 48 hours [13-15]. The increased
mortality in patients receiving warfarin appears related to
increased in-hospital haematoma expansion and not to the
initial volume of haematoma at the time of admission [14].
Rapid normalisation of INR (<2 hours) limits growth of the
haematoma [15]. These results highlight the importance of
rapid anticoagulant reversal upon admission.
Treatment options for anticoagulant reversal
In theory, there are a number of potential treatment options
for anticoagulant reversal, including administration of vitamin
K (oral or intravenous), human plasma products (for example,
fresh frozen plasma (FFP)), prothrombin complex concen￾trates (PCCs; concentrates that contain coagulation factors
II, VII, IX and X), or single coagulation factors such as
activated recombinant factor VII (rFVIIa).
Vitamin K
Normalisation with vitamin K alone is slow to take effect
because of the time required for hepatic de novo synthesis of
vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors. After intravenous
vitamin K administration, the INR falls within 4 hours, but this
may be misleading as it is almost entirely due to a rise in
factor VII [16]. The more important rise in factor II takes
approximately 24 hours [16], and correction of coagulation
factor levels takes longer following oral vitamin K adminis￾tration. The delayed effect of vitamin K on endogenous
coagulation factors complements the immediate effect of
PCC therapy, providing a rationale for co-administration of
the two products. Most studies of vitamin K alone examine
the restoration of INR to levels within the therapeutic zone in
non-haemorrhagic, over-anticoagulated patients [17]. In this
situation, where there is no need for complete reversal,
administration of vitamin K (1 to 2.5 mg) is recommended
[17-19]. When complete reversal of anticoagulation is
needed - that is, prior to surgery or when INR is very high - a
vitamin K dose of up to 5 mg is recommended [18,19]. In
patients with serious bleeding and elevated INR, the recom￾mended dose of vitamin K is 10 mg [18]. However, vitamin K
therapy alone is inadequate during an emergency situation in
which rapid cessation of bleeding or correction of INR is
required [1,2,20]. More rapid reversal can only be achieved by
the supplementation of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors
through the use of human plasma products, PCCs or rFVIIa.
Fresh frozen plasma
After a decrease in FFP consumption in the 1990s, probably
due to HIV epidemics, the use of FFP has increased in recent
years. In patients with haemorrhagic trauma, recent data
suggest that, contrary to traditional beliefs and guidelines,
early use of FFP may be associated with better patient
outcome [21]. Nevertheless, several audits have shown that
the rate of inappropriate FFP transfusion remains high con￾sidering the fact that FFP is the most frequently implicated
blood product in transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI)
[22]. Moreover, FFP continues to be used in patients who
may be better treated with other strategies [21]. FFP contains
all vitamin K-dependent factors but there are no in vitro
studies about its effectiveness in the reversal of vitamin K
antagonists; all clinical studies are observational and all
underline the longer time required by FFP to reverse INR
[15,23-25].
Prothrombin complex concentrates
Historically, PCCs were approved for the treatment of
bleeding associated with haemophilia B, due to their inclu￾sion of factor IX. Although this remains the case in some

European countries, most now have a specific factor IX
product for treatment of bleeding in haemophilia B. PCCs are
now formulated and approved specifically for vitamin K
deficiency. They generally contain a balance of coagulation
factors II, VII, IX and X, with ratios designed to limit
accumulation of factors with a long half-life, particularly factor
II [26]. PCCs often also include anticoagulants, such as
Proteins C, S and Z and antithrombin III, to balance the
opposing needs of haemorrhage control and thrombosis
avoidance (Table 2) [27]. PCCs approved for use in
anticoagulant reversal include Beriplex® P/N (CSL Behring,
Marburg, Germany) and Octaplex® (Octapharma, Vienna,
Austria), which are widely available in Europe, and other
country-specific formulations are available. The effectiveness
of PCCs for reversal of anticoagulation has been reported in
a number of clinical studies in patients with haemorrhage and
those requiring emergency intervention [12,28-36]. The rapid
onset of action of PCCs makes them ideal for anticoagulant
reversal in an emergency situation. However, there are no
clinical data comparing the efficacy of different PCCs in the
treatment of acute haemorrhage and only one in vitro study
has attempted to describe possible differences between
different PCCs, analysing reversal efficiency [37].
Activated recombinant factor VII
rFVIIa was originally used for the treatment of bleeding in
patients with trauma [38] and haemophilia; it is currently
licensed for the treatment of haemophilia and Glanzmann’s
thrombasthenia. For the treatment of haemophilia, an
alternative to rFVIIa is FEIBA (factor VIII inhibitor bypassing
activity). This is essentially a PCC with activated coagulation
factors, but it is not recommended for reversal of vitamin K
antagonists. The use of rFVIIa for treating patients on vitamin
K antagonist therapy who have life-threatening haemorrhage
has been examined in a number of studies [39-43], but there
is less clinical experience with rFVIIa than with PCCs in this
setting. Comparative investigation of rFVIIa and PCCs is
required to further elucidate differences in treatments and
their relative contribution to improved prognosis. However,
the high number of thrombotic events reported to the US
Food and Drug Administration [44] compared with the low
incidence of case reports associated with PCC use for
anticoagulation reversal, and the shorter half-life of rFVIIa
(approximately 2 hours), which complicates the transition to
the effect of vitamin K, suggest that there is not a strong
enough argument to favour rFVIIa for reversal of oral
anticoagulation [18,19].
Prothrombin complex concentrates or fresh
frozen plasma?
Guideline recommendations
Current guidelines for anticoagulant reversal are based on
the severity of the situation [18,20]. In cases of non-life￾threatening bleeding or where emergency surgery is not
necessary, the use of PCCs or FFP is not required. In cases
of severe haemorrhage, however, rapid reversal of INR is
required to prevent further bleeding. In a review by Dentali
and colleagues [20], rapid reversal of anticoagulation with
PCCs or human plasma, always administered with vitamin K,
is recommended for life-threatening bleeding with any
increase in INR, and should also be considered in major but
non-life-threatening bleeds. US recommendations also
suggest the use of PCCs in any serious or life-threatening
bleed (Table 3) [18]. Similarly, European and Australian
guidelines advocate the use of PCCs in a bleeding
emergency, largely due to the rapid response time with these
products [45-47]. In clinical practice, however, the choice
between different treatment options often leads to confusion.
Why are prothrombin complex concentrates under-used?
While all current guidelines recommend the use of PCCs in
conjunction with vitamin K for the treatment of severe
haemorrhage [18,20,45-47], they remain underused in many
surgical units [13,48]. The reasons for this are multifactorial.
First, there is a lack of knowledge of both the guidelines and
the options available for rapid reversal of anticoagulation
amongst many critical care clinicians. In some countries,
PCCs have only recently been licensed for anticoagulation
reversal. Second, there is a fear of thrombosis, reinforced by
historical reports on the use of PCCs where they were
associated with a risk of thromboembolic complications
[26,49] and many clinicians are not aware of the recent
improvements to these products and evidence indicating that
PCC use per se does not cause thromboembolic complica￾tions. There may be an element of fatalism, especially
regarding ICH in patients on oral anticoagulant therapy; such
self-fulfilling prophecies are well known in neurological events
and especially in ICH [50]. Many clinicians continue to use
FFP due to its apparently lower cost [48]. However, although
the unit cost is lower, larger volumes of FFP are required for
anticoagulant reversal; therefore, the overall cost of FFP
administration is often similar to that with PCCs, while there
are significant benefits with PCCs in terms of time, volume
and safety.
Rapid and effective correction of INR
The main priority for a patient with life-threatening haemor￾rhage is to achieve rapid cessation of bleeding. A number of
comparative studies and clinical reports have demonstrated
better correction of INR in anticoagulant reversal in patients
receiving PCCs than in those receiving FFP, reflecting
current recommendations [15,23,25,51-53]. In a study of 41
patients requiring anticoagulant reversal for either bleeding or
emergency intervention, all patients receiving PCCs (25 to
50 IU/kg; n = 29) demonstrated complete correction of INR
to a mean post-treatment level of 1.3 within 15 minutes
following infusion [25]. Conversely, the mean post-treatment
INR in 12 patients receiving 4 units of FFP was 2.3, the
lowest INR in these patients being 1.6, higher than the cut-off
required for treatment to be considered successful.
Moreover, nearly all individual measured concentrations of
vitamin K-dependent factors were above 50% in the PCC

group, while the respective concentrations remained consis￾tently under 40% in the FFP group, clearly demonstrating the
superiority of PCC in normalising the levels of the deficient
factors [25]. PCCs are also reported to result in more
effective reversal of INR in patients with ICH [15,23,51]. In a
retrospective study of patients experiencing ICH in German
critical care units by Huttner and colleagues [15], the
incidence and progression of haematoma related to ICH was
significantly lower in patients receiving PCCs (19%
(incidence) and 44% (progression)) compared with FFP
(33% (incidence) and 54% (progression)).
One of the major advantages of PCCs over FFP is the speed
at which correction of INR is achieved. In the study by
Fredriksson and colleagues [23], a mean post-treatment INR
of 1.22 was reached within 4.8 hours in patients receiving
PCCs (mean baseline INR 2.83) for treatment of ICH
compared with a reduction to INR 1.74 within 7.3 hours in
those receiving FFP (mean baseline INR 2.97). In a study of
eight patients requiring emergency reversal of phenpro￾coumon, the mean baseline INR of 3.4 decreased to less
than 1.3 within 10 minutes of administration of PCC in the
majority of patients [30]. Faster normalisation of INR with
PCCs is also due to faster preparation (no thawing required)
and faster infusion of the product.
Impact of perfusion
Another factor influencing the speed of correction is related
to the volume of PCC required for a therapeutic effect. The
volume of PCC required to reverse INR is 25-fold less than
the volume of FFP required; that is, 60 mL of PCC is
equivalent to 2,000 mL of FFP [25,54]. The lower volume of
PCCs required for anticoagulant reversal decreases the risk
of fluid overload compared to FFP.
Perfusion of human plasma products, especially FFP, is also
known to increase the risk of TRALI [22,55], which is a major
cause of death associated with transfusion [55-57]. In
contrast, no reports of transfusion-related acute lung injury
following administration of PCCs have been documented.
Viral safety
The safety of PCCs compared with human plasma products
has been the subject of much debate in recent years. There is
a risk of pathogen transmission associated with the use of
any human products. PCCs, whilst plasma-derived, undergo
a number of viral inactivation steps to minimise the risk of
pathogen transmission; in fact, some commercially available
PCCs are subject to two stages of manufacture [1,2,36,
58-60]. Such two-step inactivation processes are highly
effective in preventing transmission of a wide number of
pathogens, including HIV, hepatitis virus, herpes simplex virus
1 and influenza viruses. The purification processes involved in
the manufacture are also likely to remove prion proteins [61].
The different forms of human plasma products are subject to
differing degrees of viral inactivation; while solvent/detergent￾inactivated and methylene blue-inactivated plasma are treated
to improve their safety, single-donor plasma is often not

at increased risk of bleeding. If more rapid reversal is required because the patient requires urgent 
surgery, vitamin K (≤5 mg orally) can be given with the expectation that a reduction of the INR will occur 
in 24 h. If the INR is still high, additional vitamin K (1 to 2 mg orally) can be given (Grade 2C)
INR ≥9.0; no significant bleeding Hold warfarin therapy and give higher dose of vitamin K (2.5 to 5 mg orally) with the expectation that the

Life-threatening bleeding Hold warfarin therapy and give FFP, PCC or rFVIIa supplemented with vitamin K (10 mg by slow 
intravenous infusion); repeat if necessary, depending on INR (Grade 1C)
In cases of life-threatening bleeding, one probabilistic dose of vitamin K (10 mg) is proposed; there are no specified doses for prothrombin
complex concentrate (PCC) or recombinant activated coagulation factor VII (rFVIIa). Note: if continuing warfarin therapy is indicated after high
doses of vitamin K, then heparin or low molecular weight heparin can be given until the effects of vitamin K have been reversed and the patient
becomes responsive to warfarin therapy. It should be noted that international normalised ratio (INR) values >4.5 are less reliable than values in or
near the therapeutic range. Thus, these guidelines represent an approximate guide for high INRs. FFP, fresh frozen plasma. Reproduced with

treated for viral inactivation. Furthermore, it is common in
Europe to quarantine FFP for 4 to 6 months to minimise the
risk of viral contamination [62,63].
Thrombogenicity
As previously mentioned, historically, the main safety concern
with PCCs has been their association with thrombogenic
events. There is a common misconception that PCCs are
likely to cause thrombogenic events in patients requiring
reversal of oral anticoagulation. A review of studies with a
total of 460 patients revealed seven thrombotic complica￾tions, but the extent to which these complications were
caused by PCCs cannot be determined [64]. The low
incidence (2%) must be considered in light of the fact that all
patients receiving warfarin therapy do so for underlying
tendency to thrombosis [65]. Therefore, the real risk of
thrombosis is more likely related to the underlying disease. In
patients with atrial fibrillation or mechanical valves, the risk of
thrombosis is calculated as 4% per patient per year without
oral anticoagulation therapy; this falls to 1% when under￾going oral anticoagulation therapy, but returns to 4% when
coagulation is normalised. This is equivalent to a risk of
0.02% per day [66]. Therefore, in cases of life-threatening
haemorrhage, reversal of anticoagulation should be the
priority. In most cases, anticoagulant therapy should be re￾introduced after ensuring that haemorrhage has been
stopped. Current PCC formulations have been improved
relative to the older formulations; they now ordinarily contain
anticoagulants such as Proteins C, S and Z and antithrombin
III, and have lower levels of factor II relative to other factors to
reduce the risk of thrombogenic events. A recent
pharmacokinetic study of a PCC examined the post-treatment
levels of the thrombogenicity marker D-dimer in addition to
the coagulation factors [59]. Whilst increases in factors II, VII,
IX, X, and Proteins C and S were observed within 5 minutes
of treatment, there was no increase in D-dimer and no clinical
evidence of thrombosis. Cases of thrombogenic
complications have also been reported in patients receiving
other human plasma products such as solvent/detergent￾inactivated and methylene blue-inactivated plasma [67,68].
Practical use of prothrombin complex
concentrates
Speed to correction of INR
In emergency situations, critical care clinicians are likely to
have to deal with patients requiring urgent anticoagulant
reversal, with little time available to consult haematologists.
Whatever the site of a haemorrhage, a rapid therapeutic
effect is essential [31,69].
Due to the lower therapeutic volume of PCCs, they can be
infused faster than human plasma. The fastest infusion rate of
PCCs to date was reported in patients requiring anti￾coagulant reversal in a prospective cohort study; in this study,
a median dose of 3,600 IU of PCCs was delivered over a
median of 6 minutes, an infusion rate of 17 mL/minute [30].
However, the fastest approved infusion speed of any PCC is
approximately 8 mL/minute. Along with the faster preparation
time for PCCs, the lack of cross-matching and thawing
required, this leads to a significant reduction in the time from
presentation of bleeding or diagnosis to INR correction
[1,52,59], with PCCs providing INR correction within about
15 minutes [1], often achieved through the administration of a
single-dose bolus [33].
Co-administration of prothrombin complex
concentrates with vitamin K
To maximise their therapeutic effect, PCCs should be
administered simultaneously with vitamin K. In a recent
pharmacokinetic study by Ostermann and colleagues [59],
the median terminal half-lives of factors II, VII, IX and X were
59.7, 4.2, 16.7 and 30.7 hours, respectively. The clinical
effect will last around 5 hours, in accordance with the half-life
of factor VII [70]. Notably, re-injecting PCCs after this time
can cause accumulation of factors with a long half-life (for
example, factor II), which can exaggerate the thrombotic risk.
Vitamin K raises levels of endogenous factor VII 5 to 6 hours
following administration [1]. Simultaneous administration of
vitamin K with PCCs therefore allows a sustained recovery,
often without the need for further administration of PCCs.
Dosing of prothrombin complex concentrates and
general management of reversal
Recommended dosing of PCCs for anticoagulant reversal
has historically been based on the dose used in treatment of
haemophilia, which reflects the factor IX content administered
per bodyweight [1,32]. While fixed doses are used commonly
and are effective in reversal of anticoagulation [34], other
studies advocate the use of individualised dosing based on
the INR at the time of presentation (Figure 2). This approach
seems to be associated with low variability in the actual INR
after treatment [12,31,32]. However, it requires physicians to
wait for the INR at arrival to be determined before reversal
can be initiated. In the absence of a device for bedside
testing, this time delay can be very deleterious in cases of life￾threatening haemorrhage.
The dose-response between coagulation time and PCC dose
is not proven and studies remain ambivalent about this. For
example, an in vitro study measuring changes in prothrombin
time following administration of different doses of PCCs at a
range of different INRs (2.1, 3.6, 4.7, 5.1 and 6.7) failed to
demonstrate a dose-response curve, with better reversal
observed at an initial INR of 6.7 compared to that with an
initial INR of 5.1 with the same dose of PCC [71]. The
balance between coagulant and anticoagulant factors in a
patient after perfusion of PCC with pro- and anti-coagulant
factors (for example, Proteins C and S) may provide some
answers to this issue. Factor II is likely to have been mainly
responsible for previous thrombogenic events associated
with PCCs [26] and, due to its long half-life, would
accumulate after repeated administration. Therefore, avoidance
Critical Care Vol 13 No 2 Vigué

of repeated administration is recommended to minimise the
risk of thrombogenic events.
It is strongly recommended that PCCs should be rapidly
available to critical care physicians. Many PCCs have a short
preparation time since they are stored at room temperature in
the emergency department. Several clinical studies have
demonstrated reversal within 3 to 10 minutes [12,33].
When considering major haemorrhage, it is important to fix a
goal for reversal. Different goals have been set for normalisa￾tion of INR, often lowering it to 1 to <2 [2,12,31,72,73]. INR
recommendations for coagulation control in case of traumatic
haemorrhagic shock, where the coagulation capacity is
considered efficient, is equal to or less than 1.5 [74]. For the
moment, an INR of 1.5 or less seems to be the optimum goal
for oral anticoagulant reversal [18] but future studies are
required to confirm this.
Since normalisation of coagulation should be as rapid as
possible, treatment with a ‘probabilistic dose’ of PCC may be
considered as soon as the diagnosis of haemorrhage is
confirmed (Figure 3) [19]. This avoids time delays in
determining the dose, which arise through waiting for test
results such as INR or complicated calculations
recommended in some reports [2]. To ensure the best
chance of ultra-rapid coagulation, we propose a probabilistic
dose of 25 IU/kg (1 mL/kg) of factor IX with an INR
performed post-perfusion to control the reversal [33].
Probabilistic dosing may be controversial because most PCC
dosing recommendations are calculated using additional
parameters such as INR; it is therefore possible that INR
might not be completely normalised using this approach.
However, this has never been reported, and an immediate
probabilistic dose minimises haemorrhagic risk.
Monitoring international normalised ratio
After anticoagulant reversal with PCCs, other haemostatic
treatments (surgery or artery embolism) should not be
delayed by waiting for normalisation of INR. If following the
initial PCC administration the INR is not less than 1.5, further
doses can be administered based on the post-treatment INR.
Information on the INR at arrival may not be essential for
reversal, given the option of probabilistic dosing. However,
PCC dosing may often be determined by INR and it can also
provide interesting information on the reasons for the
haemorrhage, which may influence future treatments. In
general, therefore, it is preferable to take a blood sample
before attempting to reverse anticoagulation.
The most interesting INR is that taken after treatment to
assess the success of the reversal. The time for distribution
of factors in the extracellular space is not well-known but
pharmacokinetic studies in healthy volunteers are in favour of
an ultra-rapid dispersion with a steady-state observed at the
first point sampled, 5 minutes after perfusion [59]. Therefore,

Calculation of prothrombin complex concentrate dose for
anticoagulant reversal in bleeding patients [2]. The proposed
‘calculation of dose’ method is difficult to manage in an emergency
situation when immediate normalisation of the international normalised
ratio (INR) is required to stop life-threatening bleeding. Reproduced

it can be assumed that control of INR is achieved within 5 to
30 minutes after injection.
An INR measurement taken 6 hours after reversal demon￾strates control of the capacity of endogenous hepatic
production of factors. At this point there may be an added
thrombotic risk from further administration of PCC at higher
INR ranges because of the long half-life of factor II and its
possible accumulation. Conversely, if the initial dose of PCC
was low (25 IU/kg), it is possible to administer a second dose
of 12.5 to 25 IU/kg (0.5 to 1.0 mL/kg) if the INR at 6 hours
indicates a high risk of bleeding (INR >1.5). This approach
provides a further 5 hours of control before vitamin K
increases production of endogenous coagulation factors. A
final assessment at 24 hours can be useful to discuss the
treatment after the haemorrhagic event and examine the
thrombotic and haemorrhagic risk for the patient.
The development of new point-of-care devices for INR testing
could change attitudes towards INR testing as it is useful to
determine whether doses related to INR are related to clinical
reality. For the moment, INR testing at point-of-care and the
bedside has been investigated in patients receiving oral
anticoagulants, with conflicting reports of the accuracy of this
method [75-77]. Further improvements in bedside INR
monitoring will improve diagnosis, and achieve more rapid
and accurate tailored treatment.
Conclusions
Severe vitamin K antagonist-related haemorrhages are being
encountered more frequently by critical care clinicians and, in
line with the increasing use of oral anticoagulant therapy, the
need for rapid reversal of anticoagulation before emergency
surgery is more common. These situations must be treated
rapidly to stop bleeding and improve patient outcomes.
Supplementation of coagulation factors via the administration
of PCCs provides effective correction of coagulation more
rapidly than the alternative treatment options. Moreover,
PCCs are associated with a reduced risk of pathogen
transmission and volume overload compared with human
plasma. Although PCCs are widely recommended in current
guidelines, their use remains limited due to a lack of
understanding of their clinical benefits. PCCs are an effective
treatment for the cessation of severe bleeding and for rapid
normalisation of INR in patients receiving vitamin K antago￾nists, and their use should be considered immediately at the
time of presentation or diagnosis in emergency situations.
