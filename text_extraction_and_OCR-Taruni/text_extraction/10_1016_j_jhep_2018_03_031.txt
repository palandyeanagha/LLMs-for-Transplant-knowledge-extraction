Abstract: 
Background & Aims: The degree of cholestasis is an important disease driver in alcoholic 
hepatitis, a severe clinical condition that needs new biomarkers and targeted therapies. 
The mechanisms and biomarkers linked to cholestasis are largely unknown. Methods:
Here, we analyzed a well characterized cohort of patients with alcoholic hepatitis and 
correlated clinical and histological parameters and outcomes with serum bile acids and 
fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19), a major regulator of bile acids synthesis. Results:
We found that total and conjugated bile acids were significantly increased in patients 
with alcoholic hepatitis compared with controls. Serum FGF19 levels were strongly 
increased and gene expression of FGF19 was induced in biliary epithelial cells and 
ductular cells of patients with alcoholic hepatitis. De novo bile acid synthesis (CYP7A1
gene expression and C4 serum levels) was significantly decreased in alcoholic hepatitis 
patients. Importantly, total and conjugated bile acids correlated positively with FGF19 
and with disease severity (MELD). FGF19 correlated best with conjugated cholic acid 
(CA), and MELD best with taurine-conjugated chenodeoxycholic acid (T-CDCA). 
Univariate analysis demonstrated significant associations between FGF19 and bilirubin 
as well as gamma-glutamyl-transferase (GGT), and negative correlations between FGF19 
and fibrosis stage as well as polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) infiltration in all 
alcoholic hepatitis patients. Conclusion: Serum FGF19 and bile acids are significantly 
increased in patients with alcoholic hepatitis, while de novo bile acid synthesis is 
suppressed. Modulation of bile acid metabolism or signaling could represent a promising 
target for treatment of alcoholic hepatitis in humans.

Understanding underlying mechanisms that drive alcoholic hepatitis is important for the 
development of new biomarkers and targeted therapies. Here we describe a molecule that 
is increased in patients with alcoholic hepatitis and modulating this pathway might lead 
to promising targets for the treatment of alcoholic hepatitis. 
Introduction: 
Alcohol abuse is the most important cause for liver disease worldwide 1
. The most severe 
form of alcoholic liver disease is alcoholic hepatitis with mortality rates of 20-40% at 1-6 
months, and a 90-day mortality rate of up to 75% in severe alcoholic hepatitis 2-4
. 
Corticosteroids are the only effective medical therapy but failure in many patients has 
been reported 2
. There is no cure for patients not responding to medical therapy, except 
for early liver transplantation that is offered in some centers to a highly selected group of 
patients 5
. 
Alcoholic hepatitis is a hepatocellular disease associated with cholestasis and 
accumulation of bile acids in the liver and the systemic circulation 6
. Accumulation of 
bile acids in the liver can result in hepatocellular damage followed by inflammation and 
fibrosis 7
. Early studies using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) have 
identified elevated bile acid levels in patients with alcoholic hepatitis and a positive 
correlation with the alcoholic hepatitis score 8
. The liver controls bile acid homeostasis 
via a complicated network of pathways regulated by nuclear receptors 7
. One important 
regulator is fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19), a hormone that is secreted in the 
intestine and reaches the liver via the portal circulation. Binding of FGF19 to its receptor, 
fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 and β-Klotho, activates mitogen-activated protein 
kinase pathways, resulting in the downregulation of the rate-limiting enzyme of bile acid 

6
synthesis, cytochrome P450 family 7 subfamily A member 1 (CYP7A1), gene expression 
and inhibition of bile acid synthesis 9
. Although FGF19 is not detectable in the liver 
under normal conditions, previous studies suggest that FGF19 is expressed under 
cholestatic conditions, such as in patients with primary biliary cholangitis. Plasma/serum 
elevated FGF19 levels are elevated in patients with various hepatic disorders including 
non-cirrhotic and cirrhotic primary biliary cholangitis and in patients with extrahepatic 
cholestasis 9-11
. FGF19 mRNA expression was increased in the terminal ileum of actively 
drinking patients with cirrhosis when compared with patients with cirrhosis of 
nonalcoholic etiology 12
. 
In this study, we first determined serum bile acid levels and bile acid composition in 
patients with alcoholic hepatitis using mass spectrometry. We further investigated the 
relationship between bile acids, FGF19 and histopathological parameters and clinical 
outcomes in the setting of alcoholic hepatitis. The results of this study can help to 
understand the pathophysiology of alcoholic hepatitis as well as to evaluate the role of 
recombinant FGF19 preparations used in treatment.

Methods: 
Patient cohorts 
132 patients with alcoholic hepatitis, nine patients with alcohol use disorder, and nine 
non-alcoholic control patients were enrolled from the InTeam Consortium from the 12 
participating centers. Inclusion criteria were: 1. Age >18 years and ≤ 70 years, 2. Active 
alcohol abuse (>50 g/day for men and >40 g/day for women) in the last 3 months, 3. 
aspartate aminotransferase (AST) > alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and total bilirubin > 
3 mg/dl in the past 3 months, 4. Liver biopsy and/or clinical picture consistent with 
alcoholic hepatitis. Exclusion criteria were: 1. Autoimmune liver disease (ANA > 1/320), 
2. Chronic viral hepatitis, 3. Hepatocellular carcinoma, 4. Complete portal vein 
thrombosis, 5. Extrahepatic terminal disease, 6. Pregnancy, and 7. Lack of signed 
informed consent. The mortality was evaluated at 30 days. For the three patients who 
underwent liver transplantation, the transplantation date was considered as date of death. 
The protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of each participating center and 
patients were enrolled after written informed consent was obtained from each patient. 
FGF19 levels, C4 levels, serum bile acid levels, other clinical laboratory parameters and 
clinical outcomes were measured and collected. The Model for End-stage Liver Disease 
(MELD) score was calculated from all patients from whom bilirubin level, international 
normalized ratio (INR), and creatinine level was available. 
Bile acid measurements 
Serum levels of total bile acids, conjugated and unconjugated as well as specific bile 
acids were measured in an Agilent series 6120 quadrupole mass detector as described 

8
previously 13. In brief, serum (20 µl) was protein precipitated with 80 µl of cold 
acetonitrile containing deuterated cholic acid as an internal standard, vortexed for 1 min 
and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4ºC. Supernatant was evaporated under 
vacuum and reconstituted in assay mobile phase. Bile acid separation was achieved using 
an Acuity (Waters, Milford, MA) UPLC BEH C18 column (1.7microns 2.1x100mm) on a 
Nextera UPLC (Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan); the temperature of the column and auto 
sampler was 65ºC and 12ºC, respectively. Sample injection volume was 1µl. The mobile 
phase consisted of 10% acetonitrile and 10% methanol in water containing 0.1% formic 
acid (Mobile Phase A) and 10% methanol in acetonitrile 0.1% formic acid (Mobile Phase 
B) delivered as a gradient: 0-5 min Mobile Phase B held at 22%; 5-12 min Mobile Phase 
B increased linearly to 60%, 12-15min Mobile Phase B increased linearly to 80% and 15-
19 min Mobile Phase B constant at 80% at a flow rate of 0.5ml/min. The mass 
spectrometer (Q-Trap 5500; Sciex, Framingham, MA) was operated in negative electro￾spray mode working in the multiple reaction mode (MRM). Operating parameters were: 
curtain gas 30psi; ion spray voltage 4500 V; temperature 550ºC; ion source gas 1 60psi; 
ion source gas 2 65psi. Transition MRMs, declustering potential, entrance potentials and 
collision cell exit potentials were optimized using the Analyst software (Sciex, 
Framingham, MA). Dwell times were 25msec. Only bile acids with an overall 
contribution of >2% in healthy subjects were analyzed and depicted in figures and tables. 
Quantification of C4 levels 

9
7-alpha-Hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (C4) was purchased from Toronto Research 
Chemicals (Toronto, Canada). Cortisol-1,2-d2 was purchased from CDN Isotopes 
(Hornsby, NSW, Australia) and Charcoal Stripped Serum was purchased from Sigma￾Aldrich (Castle Hill, NSW, Australia). Additional reagents and solvents were of HPLC 
grade. To 10µL of serum, 50µL of ice cold Acetonitrile containing 2% Formic Acid and 
1.8µg of the assay Internal standard Cortisol-1,2-d2, was added. The mixture was 
vortexed for 1 minute and centrifuged at 10 000rpm for 10 minutes. The supernatant was 
collected and evaporated under vacuum at room temperature. The samples were then 
reconstituted in the assay mobile phase and transferred to a 96 well plate for analysis. 
Stock solution of C4 (1µM) was prepared in Charcoal Stripped Serum (CSS) and this was 
further diluted in CSS to give final concentrations of 0.01-1µM. The standards were then 
treated in the same way as the samples. A Nextera UPLC (SHIMADZU, Kyoto, Japan) 
system was used in combination with a Q-TRAP 5500 Mass Spectrometer (AB SCIEX, 
Toronto, Canada) with Analyst Software 1.6.2. Chromatographic separations were 
performed with an ACQUITY (WATERS, Milford, MA) UPLC BEH C18 column 
(1.7microns 2.1x100mm). The temperature of the column and auto sampler was 65°C and 
12°C, respectively. Sample injection was 1µL. The mobile phase consisted of 10% 
Acetonitrile and 10% Methanol in water containing 0.1% Formic Acid (Mobile Phase A) 
and 10% Methanol in Acetonitrile 0.1% Formic Acid (Mobile Phase B) delivered as a 
gradient: 0 -3-min Mobile Phase B 20%; 3-3.5-min Mobile Phase B 80%, 7-9min Mobile 
Phase B was a constant 80% at a flow rate of 0.5ml/min. The mass spectrometer was 
operated in positive electro-spray mode working in the multiple reaction mode (MRM). 
Transition MRMs for C4 and the Internal Standard Cortisol-1,2-d2 were 401.2→177.2 

10
and 365.2→122.2 respectively. Operating parameters were: Curtain gas 30psi; Ion spray 
voltage 4500 V; Temperature 550C; Ion Source Gas 1 60psi; Ion Source Gas2 65psi. 
Declustering Potential, Entrance Potentials and Collision Cell Exit Potentials were 
optimized using the Analyst software. 
FGF19 ELISA 
FGF19 concentrations were measured from serum samples using an ELISA kit from 
Biovendor (Asheville, NC) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. 
FGF19 immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry was performed on 4 micron formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded 
liver core biopsies. The tissue sections were stained with an antibody to FGF19 (1:300) 
from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA). Slides were stained on a Ventana Discovery Ultra 
(Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, AZ, USA). Antigen retrieval was performed using 
CC1 for 92 minutes at 95oC. Due to the very low expression level of FGF19, IHC 
detection required the use of the HQ amplification system (Ventana) to detect the weakly 
expressing FGF19 cells within the liver and was followed by an HRP-conjugated 
antibody and DAB as a chromagen. IHC staining was followed by a hematoxylin 
counterstain. Slides were rinsed, dehydrated through alcohol and xylene and coverslipped. 
RNA Sequencing 

11
High-throughput transcriptome profiling by RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was performed 
using Illumina HiSeq2000 platform (San Diego, CA) with liver samples provided by the 
InTeam Consortium Human Biorepository Core (University of Pittsburgh, PA) as 
described (Manuscript in preparation; Argemi JM, Bataller R et al.). 51 patients with 
different phenotypes were selected: 12 patients with early alcoholic steatohepatitis, 11 
patients with non-severe alcoholic hepatitis (with Maddrey discriminant function (MDF 
≤32), 18 patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis (MDF>32), 10 explants from patients 
who underwent early liver transplantation for severe alcoholic hepatitis. Controls (n=10) 
were non-diseased livers obtained from biopsied single nodules, whose histology was 
without significant alterations. 
Statistical analysis 
Statistical analysis was conducted using GraphPad PRISM (La Jolla, USA) and R 
statistical software 14. Comparisons between three groups or more were conducted using 
One-Way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-test for multiple comparisons (for continuous 
variables) and Chi-squared tests (for categorical variables) using GraphPad PRISM. A 
comparison of two groups was performed using the unpaired student t-test. Univariate 
regression analysis was performed using R to determine associations of FGF19 and 
MELD with several biochemical markers and clinical outcomes. Cox univariate 
regression analysis was used to determine associations of FGF19 with 30-day mortality. 
Results: 
Demographic and laboratory data 

12
A total of 33 subjects were initially assessed: Nine non-alcoholic control subjects, nine 
patients with alcohol use disorder and 15 untreated patients with alcoholic hepatitis. Their 
demographic and laboratory data are shown in Table 1. Patients with alcoholic hepatitis 
had significantly higher levels of bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), albumin 
and international normalized ratio (INR) compared with alcohol dependent and control 
subjects. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were significantly elevated in alcoholic 
hepatitis patients relative to controls. The mean Model for End-stage Liver Disease 
(MELD) value of patients with alcoholic hepatitis was 25. 
Serum bile acid levels and bile acid composition 
To assess alterations in bile acid levels and bile acid composition, serum samples were 
analyzed from patients with alcoholic hepatitis at the time of inclusion, patients with 
alcohol use disorder and controls using mass spectrometry. The results of the bile acid 
measurements are depicted in Fig. 1. Total and conjugated bile acids were significantly 
elevated in alcoholic hepatitis patients compared with controls and patients with alcohol 
use disorder (Fig. 1A and B). In addition, the individual taurine- and glycine-conjugates 
were significantly increased in patients with alcoholic hepatitis in relation to patients with 
alcohol use disorder and controls (Fig. 1C and D). In contrast, there was no significant 
difference in the unconjugated bile acids comparing the three groups in absolute 
concentrations (Fig. 1E). 
Bile acid composition analysis of the different patient populations revealed significantly 
elevated glyco-cholic acid (G-CA), tauro-cholic acid (T-CA) and tauro-chenodeoxycholic 
acid (T-CDCA) in alcoholic hepatitis patients compared with alcohol dependent patients 

13
and controls. In contrast, patients with alcoholic hepatitis showed significantly lower 
levels of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), deoxycholic acid (DCA), glyco-deoxycholic 
acid (G-DCA) and cholic acid (CA) as well as lower proportional contributions of total 
unconjugated bile acids compared with control patients and patients with alcohol use 
disorder (Fig. 1F). Hyodeoxycholic acid (HDCA), tauro-deoxycholic acid (T-DCA) and 
tauro-lithocholic acid (T-LCA) were also significantly lower in patients with alcoholic 
hepatitis compared with controls. Conjugated CDCA and conjugated CA were 
significantly higher in alcoholic hepatitis patients when compared with controls (61.0% 
vs 35.8%, and 32.8% vs 12.6%, respectively) and conjugated CA were also significantly 
higher in alcoholic hepatitis patients compared with alcohol dependent patients (32.8% vs. 
13.6%). In contrast, conjugated DCA were decreased in patients with alcoholic hepatitis 
compared with alcohol dependent patients and controls (1.4% vs 13.0% and 14.5%) (Fig. 
1F). 
Regulation of bile acid synthesis 
To understand the regulation and metabolism of bile acids in alcoholic hepatitis, serum 7-
alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (C4) levels and FGF19 levels were determined. C4, a 
bile acid synthesis intermediate serves as a marker for de novo bile acid synthesis while 
FGF19 represents an important negative feedback regulator of bile acid synthesis. 
FGF19 levels were significantly elevated in patients with alcoholic hepatitis relative to 
patients with alcohol use disorder and controls (Fig. 2A). In line with these results, serum 
C4 levels were significantly decreased in patients with alcoholic hepatitis compared with 

14
controls (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that FGF19 regulates de novo bile acid synthesis, 
but total serum bile acid levels are not affected. 
Analysis of hepatic FGF19 gene expression in different patient populations as well as of 
hepatic genes related to bile acid uptake, synthesis and efflux 
FGF19 serum levels measured in patients with alcoholic hepatitis were markedly higher 
(by ~100 fold) compared with FGF19 levels detected in patients with non-alcoholic 
steatohepatitis (NASH) or non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) whose serum levels were 
similar to control subjects 15. In addition, as intrahepatic cholestasis is associated with 
hepatic expression of FGF19 in conditions such as primary biliary cholangitis 10
, we 
wanted to determine whether hepatic FGF19 production was also induced in alcoholic 
hepatitis. Hepatic FGF19 gene expression was hence quantitated in multiple patient
groups with different liver pathologies. Fig. 3 depicts mRNA expression levels in patients 
with normal liver histology (control subjects), early alcoholic steatohepatitis, non-severe 
alcoholic hepatitis, severe alcoholic hepatitis responders and non-responders as well as 
explants from alcoholic hepatitis patients. Hepatic FGF19 expression was essentially 
undetectable in controls and in patients with early alcoholic steatohepatitis, but its levels 
increased with severity of liver pathology, and significantly elevated hepatic FGF19 gene 
expression was detected in patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis (responders as well as 
non-responders) and in explants from alcoholic hepatitis patients compared with control 
subjects (Fig. 3A). In addition, hepatic expression levels of genes involved in bile acid 
uptake, synthesis, and excretion were analyzed in the aforementioned patient groups. 
Patients with increasing severity of liver pathology showed a lower gene expression of 

15
Na+
-taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (NTCP; SLC10A1) that is involved in bile 
acid uptake into hepatocytes (Fig. 3B). Worsening liver disease was also associated with 
a reduction of CYP7A1 expression and hence impaired bile acid synthesis (Fig. 3C), 
which is consistent with low serum C4 levels. The expression of another gene involved in 
bile acid synthesis, cytochrome P450 family 8 subfamily B member 1 (CYP8B1), was 
relatively stable and independent of the degree of liver disease (Fig. 3D). The expression 
of the bile salt export pump (BSEP; ABCB11) important for bile acid excretion into bile 
canaliculi was significantly decreased in patients with different severity of alcoholic 
hepatitis when compared with control subjects (Fig. 3E). The hepatic gene expression of 
transporters important for bile acid efflux from the basolateral membrane into the 
systemic circulation multidrug resistance-associated protein 4 (MRP4; ABCC4) and 
MRP3 (ABCC3) correlated with worsening alcoholic hepatitis (Fig. 3F and G). 
Biliary epithelial cells and ductular cells express FGF19 in the liver of patients with 
alcoholic hepatitis 
Given few reports about hepatic FGF19 synthesis in different cells such as hepatocytes in 
primary biliary cholangitis 10 or hepatic cancer stem cells in hepatocellular carcinoma 
(HCC) 16, we determined the cellular source of FGF19 production, after establishing that 
alcoholic hepatitis patients show induced FGF19 mRNA in their liver (Fig. 3A). 
Cholangiocytes in larger bile ducts and (to a lesser degree) ductular cells of smaller 
ductules were FGF19-positive in patients with alcoholic hepatitis (Fig. 4A and B). A few 
non-parenchymal cells (most likely endothelial cells) also stained positive for FGF19 
(Fig. 4C). Gallbladder epithelial cells from a resected gall bladder served as positive 

16
staining control (Fig. 4D). Non-neoplastic liver (adjacent to a resected HCC) with portal 
tracts was negative for FGF19 protein (Fig. 4E), although large caliber bile ducts are 
weakly positive for FGF19 (Fig. 4F). 
Specific bile acids associated with serum FGF19, MELD, and ALT levels 
As bile acid levels were much higher in alcoholic hepatitis patients than in controls and 
patients with alcohol use disorder (Fig. 1), we proceeded to perform univariate regression 
analysis of the most abundant bile acids with MELD and serum FGF19 levels. Our 
analysis showed significant positive associations between total bile acids, absolute 
conjugated bile acids, proportional conjugated bile acids with MELD or FGF19 levels 
(Table 2, 3). The unconjugated bile acids CDCA, CA, DCA as well as conjugated DCA 
negatively correlated with MELD and FGF19 levels (Table 2, 3). MELD was also 
significantly associated with T-BA, T-CA and conjugated CA but even more significantly 
with T-CDCA (Table 2 and Fig. 5A). In addition to MELD, bilirubin values were 
analyzed and associated with various bile acids. Univariate regression analysis yielded 
similar results to those obtained with MELD and bile acids (Supplementary Table 1). 
Furthermore, the conjugated-to-unconjugated bile acid ratio, G-CA, T-CA, and 
conjugated CA were highly significantly correlated – all positively – with serum FGF19 
(Table 3). 
Laboratory and clinical parameters associated with FGF19 
As FGF19 levels were highest in patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis (Fig. 2A), we 
next determined the role of serum FGF19 as potential biomarker in alcoholic hepatitis, 
and correlated it with multiple laboratory and clinical parameters. For this analysis, a 

17
larger cohort of patients with alcoholic hepatitis (treated and untreated at the time of 
inclusion) was analyzed. Demographic, clinical and biochemical parameters of patients 
with alcoholic hepatitis are presented in Table 4 (n=132). Univariate regression analysis 
revealed a significant positive correlation of FGF19 with bilirubin levels and gamma￾glutamyl-transferase (GGT) (Table 5). A significant negative correlation was detected 
between FGF19 and the patients’ fibrosis stage as well as their level of 
polymorphonuclear cell (PMN) infiltration (Table 5). 
Similarly, when comparing FGF19 serum levels of alcoholic hepatitis patients with above 
average bilirubin levels with alcoholic hepatitis patients with below average bilirubin 
levels, significantly different FGF19 levels can be detected (Fig. 5B). The same holds 
true for the comparison of FGF19 and GGT. Significantly higher FGF19 are noted in 
patients with higher GGT than in alcoholic hepatitis patients with lower GGT levels (Fig. 
5C). 
We decided to examine a subgroup of patients with more severe alcoholic hepatitis more 
closely (MELD ≥ 29, >75th percentile) as FGF19 started to rise more markedly when the 
contribution of conjugated bile acids to the total bile acid content was close to 100% (Fig. 
5D), indicating a more distinct increase with more severe cholestasis and alcoholic 
hepatitis. Univariate Cox regression analysis revealed FGF19 correlates significantly with 
30-day mortality in patients with more severe alcoholic hepatitis (Table 6). However, the 
hazard ratio was fairly modest. 

18
However, 30-day mortality was not significantly correlated with FGF19 when all 
alcoholic hepatitis patients were analyzed. Also, Cox multivariate analysis revealed no 
independent prognostic value of FGF19 in combination with MELD (data not shown). 
Discussion: 
This study investigated the relationship between bile acids, FGF19 and clinical outcomes 
in patients with alcoholic hepatitis. Patients with alcoholic hepatitis had significantly 
increased total, and absolute and proportional conjugated bile acid levels in relation to 
controls and patients with alcohol use disorder. In particular the proportional contribution 
of G-/T-CDCA and G-/T-CA was significantly higher and that of G-/T-DCA was 
significantly lower in alcoholic hepatitis patients than in controls and patients with 
alcohol use disorder. The increase in the conjugated primary bile acids G-/T-CDCA and 
G-/T-CA in alcoholic hepatitis patients can in part be explained by the presence of 
cholestasis in alcoholic hepatitis 6
, also demonstrated by increased bilirubin and GGT 
levels in alcoholic hepatitis patients in our study. Given cholestasis, significantly lower 
amounts of primary bile acids are secreted into the intestine. Normally, these primary bile 
acids are metabolized by bacterial 7-alpha dehydroxylase to secondary bile acids (CA to 
DCA, and CDCA to LCA) 17. However, as lower amounts of CA reach the intestine in 
cholestasis, less DCA will be produced by the intestinal bacteria and hence be absorbed 
in the ileum into the systemic circulation in form of conjugated DCA in alcoholic 
hepatitis patients (Fig. 1F). 

19
Serum FGF19 levels were markedly increased in patients with alcoholic hepatitis by 
about 100 times in relation to controls. FGF19 inhibits hepatic CYP7A1, the rate-limiting 
enzyme for bile acid synthesis 18. Serum C4, a marker for de novo bile acid synthesis, 
was hence significantly decreased in alcoholic hepatitis patients compared with controls. 
However, total serum bile acid levels were not affected by the suppression of bile acid 
synthesis in alcoholic hepatitis patients suggesting a prominent role of cholestasis. As 
serum FGF19 levels were markedly increased in alcoholic hepatitis patients, the hepatic 
gene expression of FGF19 was quantitated. Hepatic gene expression increased with 
increasing severity of alcoholic hepatitis. This correlated with decreasing CYP7A1 in 
more severe forms of alcohol hepatitis. Interestingly, CYP8B1 was not affected by the 
degree of liver disease. As seen in obstructive cholestasis 19, bile acid uptake (NTCP) and 
bile acid transport into the biliary canaliculi (BSEP) were significantly decreased in 
alcoholic hepatitis patients in relation to controls. Similarly, bile acid efflux into the 
systemic circulation by MRP3 and MRP4 increased with worsening alcoholic hepatitis, as 
described previously in obstructive cholestasis 20,21. These changes in expression of bile 
acid transporters can be interpreted as a protective mechanism of the body to decrease the 
concentration of bile acids in the liver. 
FGF19 is classically produced and secreted in the ileum, and travels to the liver to 
suppress CYP7A1 10. FGF19 has been shown to be produced by epithelial cells of the 
gallbladder, hepatocytes, and hepatic stem cells in various diseases 10,16. FGF19 gene 
expression increased in the small and large intestine in alcoholic cirrhotics in relation to 
controls 12,22. In the current study, we are the first to show that FGF19 gene expression is 

20
also significantly increased in the liver in severe alcoholic hepatitis, and that 
predominantly cholangiocytes and ductular cells from smaller ductules (progenitor cells) 
produce FGF19, which is consistent with high FGF19 expression in bile duct cells from a 
human liver with biliary cirrhosis 23. Although a de novo induction of hepatic FGF19 is 
the likely cause for the dramatic increase of serum FGF19 in patients with alcoholic 
hepatitis, we cannot exclude the possibility that other organs might contribute to this 
systemic increase as well. FGF19 gene expression was not significantly increased in 
patients with early alcoholic steatohepatitis compared with controls, which indicates that 
patients with alcohol use disorder do not induce FGF19 gene expression in the liver (Fig. 
2A). 
Serum FGF19 was not significantly different in patients with NASH compared with 
healthy controls despite significantly increased C4 levels and increased total bile acid 
levels in the feces 15. This is in contrast to alcoholic hepatitis where FGF19 serum levels 
are ~100 times higher than in controls (Fig. 2A) whose levels were similar to NASH 
patients. Alcoholic hepatitis patients have suppressed serum C4 levels likely in response 
to high FGF19 levels, possibly as a protective mechanism of the body to decrease overall 
bile acid levels in face of significantly elevated systemic bile acids. 
The MELD score correlated positively with several serum bile acids and with total bile 
acid levels, in particular with the contribution of conjugated bile acids in percent, taurine￾conjugated bile acids, and markedly with T-CDCA. There was also a significant negative 
correlation with G-DCA and conjugated DCA. In alcoholic cirrhotics, total fecal bile 

21
acids, LCA, and DCA among others were negatively correlated with the MELD score, 
but CA or CDCA were not significantly correlated with the MELD score 22. These 
findings appear in line with our findings to a certain extent with developing cholestasis in 
worsening liver disease, which results in less secretion of bile acids into the intestine and 
hence less secondary bile acids such as DCA after metabolism by intestinal bacteria. 
FGF19 correlates positively with bilirubin and GGT in alcoholic hepatitis patients, and 
hence with cholestasis. It is also associated with fibrosis stage and PMN infiltration in a 
negative fashion in patients with alcoholic hepatitis. A negative correlation between 
FGF19 serum levels and hepatic fibrosis was also seen in pediatric onset intestinal failure 
24. Injections with FGF19 reversed hepatic fibrosis in mice, supporting its beneficial 
effects 25. An increase in FGF19 could hence be viewed as an advantageous reaction of 
the body. Severe PMN infiltration was associated with improved survival in an alcoholic 
hepatitis cohort 6
. Therefore, a negative correlation of PMN infiltration with FGF19 
appears deleterious in our alcoholic hepatitis group. As FGF19 tends to increase with 
significant cholestasis (Table 5, Fig. 5D), we looked at a subgroup of patients with more 
severe alcoholic hepatitis (with MELD ≥ 29, >75th percentile). In this subgroup FGF19 
correlated positively with mortality (Table 6). Whether this is causative or rather an 
expression of disease activity remains to be determined. Given the beneficial anti-fibrotic 
and anti-cholestatic effects 25, advantageous metabolic effects 26 and hepato-regenerative 
effects of FGF19 27, a compensatory up-regulation of FGF19 by the body in response to 
worsening liver health appears more likely. 

22
This study has several limitations. First and foremost, this study involves many centers 
and therefore there are differences in sampling and patient management. Second, bile 
acids and C4 levels were only available for the exploratory patient cohort with alcoholic 
hepatitis who was untreated. Third, and in contrast to that, 30% of our larger cohort of 
132 patients with alcoholic hepatitis were treated with steroids and 8% were treated with 
pentoxifylline, which might result in some heterogeneity. 
Taken together, FGF19 correlates with disease activity in alcoholic liver disease. Serum 
FGF19 levels were positively associated with total bile acids, conjugated bile acids, 
conjugated/unconjugated bile acid ratio as well as T-CA, G-CA and conjugated CA. 
Given its (highly) significant correlation with several bile acids and ability to be induced 
by the hepatic FXR 18, therapeutic modulation of the master regulator of the bile acid 
metabolism, FXR, might present a therapeutic opportunity in alcoholic hepatitis. 
Obeticholic acid, an FXR agonist, has been shown to improve alkaline phosphatase and 
total bilirubin levels in primary biliary cholangitis in clinical trials 28. The FLINT trial 
demonstrated that obeticholic acid also improves ALT levels and histologic features of 
NASH 29. The FXR agonist obeticholic acid is currently being investigated in patients 
with moderately severe alcoholic hepatitis (TREAT, NCT02039219 on 
ClinicalTrials.gov). 
The FGF19 analogue NGM282 is currently being investigated in patients with primary 
biliary cholangitis (NCT02135536 on ClinicalTrials.gov). NGM282 reduced non￾invasive fibrosis markers and fat liver content in patients with NASH 30. Given 
convincing results after interventions with FGF19 or analogues in experimental 

23
cholestatic and alcoholic liver disease 25,26, human trials with FGF19 or derivatives in 
alcoholic hepatitis could be considered.

• Serum FGF19 and bile acids are significantly increased in patients with alcoholic 
hepatitis.
• Total and conjugated bile acids correlated positively with FGF19 and with disease 
severity (MELD). 
• Modulation of bile acid metabolism or signaling could represent a promising 
target for treatment of alcoholic hepatitis in humans.
