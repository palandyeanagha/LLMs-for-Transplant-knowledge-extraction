The expanding world of small RNAs
Helge Großhans and Witold Filipowicz
Molecular cell biology has long been dominated by a protein-centric view. But the emergence of small, 
non-coding RNAs challenges this perception. These plentiful RNAs regulate gene expression at different 
levels, and have essential roles in health and disease.
Classic RNAs mediating 
protein synthesis
mRNAs (messenger RNAs)
Transcripts of protein-coding 
genes that act as templates for 
protein synthesis. 
rRNAs (ribosomal RNAs)
RNA constituents of 
the ribonucleoprotein 
particles known as 
ribosomes, which mediate 
the decoding of mRNAs to 
the amino-acid sequences 
of proteins. 
tRNAs (transfer RNAs)
Adapter molecules 
carrying individual amino 
acids to the site of protein 
synthesis that recognize 
specific codons in 
mRNA.
Non-coding regulatory RNAs
siRNAs (small interfering 
RNAs) Small RNAs (20–25 
nucleotides in length) 
formed through cleavage 
of long double-stranded 
RNA molecules. siRNAs 
are particularly important 
for taming the activity of 
transposons and combating 
viral infection, but they can 
also regulate protein-coding 
genes. Synthetic siRNAs can 
also be artificially expressed 
for experimental purposes.
miRNAs (microRNAs) Small 
RNAs (20–25 nucleotides in 
length) that are encoded by 
specific genes and function in 
repressing mRNA translation 
or in mRNA degradation in 
plants and animals. They are 
processed from long, single￾stranded RNA sequences that 
fold into hairpin structures. 
piRNAs (Piwi-associated 
RNAs) Small RNAs (25–30 
nucleotides in length) that 
are generated from long 
single-stranded precursors. 
They function in association 
with the Piwi subfamily of 
Argonaute proteins, and are 
essential for the development 
of germ cells. 
Longer non-coding RNAs
RNAs of 70 to thousands 
of nucleotides that 
participate in various cellular 
processes, including mRNA 
splicing and ribosome 
biogenesis. H.G. & W.F.
Box 1 | Prominent members of the RNA family 
How many classes of RNA have 
been identified?
There are three main types of ‘classic’ RNA: 
messenger RNA, transfer RNA and ribosomal 
RNA. mRNAs are translated into proteins, 
whereas tRNAs and rRNAs have housekeeping
roles during mRNA translation. Small RNAs 
are not translated into proteins. Instead, these 
20–30-nucleotide sequences regulate vari￾ous biological processes, often by interfering 
with mRNA translation. Small RNAs come in 
different forms (Box 1), the best-understood 
classes being small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), 
microRNAs (miRNAs) and Piwi-associated 
RNAs (piRNAs).
When were small RNAs discovered? 
During the past two to three decades, 
researchers identified many small regula￾tory RNAs, ranging in size from roughly 70 
to 300 nucleo tides, in various organisms. But 
the 20–30-nucleotide small regulatory RNAs 
were discovered more recently because, owing 
to their small size, they are easily missed in 
biochemical analysis, and they are poor targets 
for inactivation by classical genetic tools. More￾over, many miRNAs can compensate for each 
other’s function, which makes their identifica￾tion on the basis of the overt consequences of 
their absence difficult. The first two miRNAs 
to be discovered, lin-4 and let-7, were identified 
in the 1990s through genetic experiments in 
the worm Caenorhabditis elegans. Then siRNAs 
were identified in animals, plants and fungi as 
the effector molecules that mediate the pro cess 
of sequence-specific gene silencing, or RNA 
interference (RNAi), in response to double￾stranded RNA (dsRNA; Fig. 1). The discov￾ery of RNAi earned its two lead researchers, 
Andrew Fire and Craig Mello, the 2006 Nobel 
Prize in Physiology or Medicine. 
Have we identified all small RNAs?
Hardly. Although hundreds of small RNAs 
have been identified in plants and animals, 
high-throughput sequencing and sophisti￾cated bioinformatics tools repeatedly reveal the 
existence of new miRNAs and siRNAs. The 
human genome could encode more than a 
thousand miRNAs, the equivalent of a few 
per cent of protein-coding genes. Moreover, 
new classes of small RNAs continue to be 
discovered. 
Do all organisms have small RNAs?
With the notable exception of the budding yeast 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, almost all eukaryo￾tic organisms (the cells of which contain a 
nucleus) investigated so far have siRNAs or 
at least cellular machineries to produce them. 
Evolutionarily, miRNAs seem to be younger 
than siRNAs. miRNAs function primarily 
in multicellular organisms, although they 
have recently been identified in a uni cellular 
alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Certain 
DNA viruses also express miRNAs. Although 
20–30-nucleotide small RNAs have not been 
identified in archaea and eubacteria (the cells 
of which lack a nucleus), Argonaute proteins 
— the effector molecules of small RNAs — are 
present in some of these organisms. 
How are small RNAs made? 
Generally, by fragmentation of longer RNA 
sequences. The precursors of miRNAs and 
siRNAs are dsRNAs, which are processed to 
small RNAs by dedicated sets of enzymes and 
other proteins (Box 2, page 416).
Where do the dsRNAs come from?
Depending on the class of small RNA, the 
source of precursor dsRNA differs. For 
siRNAs, dsRNA can form when comple￾mentary DNA strands are transcribed into 
RNA sequences. Viral infection of a cell can 
also supply dsRNAs, as many viruses form 
RNAs of both sense and antisense polar￾ity during replication of their genomes, and 
this can trigger an RNAi response by the cell, 
as part of its antiviral defence. By contrast, 
miRNAs are excised from ‘purpose-built’, 
genome-encoded RNA precursors that 
fold into long hairpins resembling dsRNA. 
The expression of miRNA-encoding genes 
and those encoding mRNAs are controlled 
very similarly and involve the same RNA￾synthetic machinery, including the enzyme RNA 
polymerase II.

It is less clear whether siRNAs have similarly 
important functions, although in plants they 
have already been identified as essential play￾ers in the regulation of stress resistance. In 
fission yeast and plants, siRNAs contribute to 
heterochromatin formation.
And what is the link to viruses?
The use of RNAi as a defence mechanism 
against viruses may have been a driving force 
in the evolution of the siRNA pathway. In 
plants, siRNAs are an essential layer of anti￾viral defence. Also, in plants and invertebrates, 
siRNAs silence mobile genetic elements called 
transposons, which would otherwise ‘jump’ 
around the genome and disrupt cellular genes. 
It is not well known whether these small￾RNA functions are also crucial in vertebrates, 
in which the invention of a protein-based 
adaptive immune response may have reduced 
reliance on antiviral RNAi activity. 
Figure 1 | First phenotypic description of RNA interference. White sections in petunia flowers represent areas where RNAi has silenced a gene 
involved in flower coloration.
Figure 2 | miRNAs have tissue-specific 
functions. In zebrafish embryos, localization 
patterns of individual miRNAs indicate that 
their activity could be limited to tissues and 
organs in which they are expressed. As indicated 
by blue staining, miR-206 is mainly expressed 
in the muscle, miR-126 in the blood vessels and 
the heart, miR-200a in the lateral-line system (a 
mechanosensory system detecting water motion) 
and sensory organs, and miR-30c in the kidney 
precursor. 
How do small RNAs function?
They recognize their RNA targets by sequence￾specific base-pairing. The outcome of the small￾RNA–mRNA association depends on the degree 
of complementarity between the two sequences. 
When base-pairing is perfect, or almost perfect, 
as is the case for siRNAs (and possibly piRNAs), 
the target mRNA is cleaved in the middle of the 
small-RNA–mRNA duplex. Most plant miRNAs 
and some animal miRNAs function similarly. 
But most animal miRNAs base-pair imprecisely 
with mRNAs to repress their translation or to 
induce their breakdown. Irrespective of base￾pairing precision, small RNAs rely on proteins 
of the Argonaute family for their activity. In fact, 
it is the protein partners of small RNAs that 
bring about repression of translation or mRNA 
cleavage; small RNAs act only as guides to tell 
Argonaute proteins which mRNAs to target. 
So can their mRNA targets be predicted 
through sequence analysis? 
Unfortunately, the devil is in the detail — at 
least in the case of animal miRNAs, which 
mostly base-pair to their mRNA targets with 
limited complementarity. Although sequence 
analyses have revealed some criteria for inter￾action between miRNA and mRNA, and many 
bioinformatics tools for target identification 
are available, sequence-based predictions 
frequently yield false positives or miss true 
targets. So identification of bona fide miRNA 
targets requires extensive experimentation. 
By contrast, most targets of siRNAs and plant 
miRNAs can be reliably predicted on the basis 
of near-perfect sequence complementarity.
To prevent protein synthesis, isn’t it 
simpler to stop mRNA production?
Yes. Intuitively, terminating transcription 
seems a much more obvious mechanism. But a 
block in protein production always lags behind 
a block in transcription — even if transcription 
is stopped, mRNA sequences that have already 
been made can still be translated into proteins. 
So by targeting the existing mRNA pool, small 
RNAs block or attenuate protein synthesis very 
rapidly and, occasionally, even reversibly. In 
addition, because individual small RNAs can 
simultaneously target tens if not hundreds of 
mRNAs for different proteins, they are well 
suited to coordinate the expression of genes 
that function in the same or related pathways. 
For example, during zebrafish embryonic 
development, a specific miRNA, miR-430, 
targets hundreds of mRNAs for rapid degra￾dation, facilitating embryos’ transition to a 
new developmental programme that requires 
a separate set of proteins. The ability of dif￾ferent miRNAs to concurrently target several 
sequences of the same mRNA further increases 
their potential to fine-tune gene expression. 
Is all of this small-RNA-mediated 
regulation post-transcriptional?
No — small RNAs also affect DNA transcrip￾tion, particularly in plants and fission yeast. 
They do this by sequence-specific targeting of 
chromatin (complexes of DNA with histone 
proteins), converting it to the hetero chromatin 
form that is not easily accessible to the trans￾criptional machinery. Strikingly, in some 
lower eukaryotes small RNAs also direct 
massive genomic DNA rearrangements. In 
mammals, however, there is currently only 
limited evidence for small-RNA functions 
other than post-transcriptional regulation. 
Do small RNAs always silence 
gene expression?
In some conditions, small RNAs may also 
activate gene expression, although the mech￾anisms are currently not well understood. 
Indeed, a liver-specific miRNA, miR-122, is 
even needed for successful replication of the 
hepatitis C virus.
What biological processes do 
small RNAs regulate?
miRNAs were originally identified in C. elegans
for their central role in development. Consist￾ent with their function in differentiation and 
development, expression of many miRNAs is 
tissue-specific (Fig. 2) or is associated with 
certain developmental stages. miRNA expres￾sion patterns often change in diseases such as 
cancer. And, as many of the known and pre￾dicted miRNA targets have roles in disease, it 
is widely believed that dysregulation of miRNA 
expression contributes to disease pathology.

Small RNAs are generally 
produced by fragmentation 
of longer precursors. 
Small interfering RNAs 
(siRNAs) are processed 
from double-stranded RNAs 
(dsRNAs) that form by base￾pairing of complementary 
RNAs. An enzyme called Dicer 
cleaves dsRNA into shorter 
double-stranded siRNAs that 
are roughly 20 base pairs 
long. One siRNA strand then 
assembles into an effector 
complex known as an RNA￾induced silencing complex 
(RISC). This complex uses 
the siRNA guide to identify 
mRNAs with a sequence 
perfectly complementary to 
the siRNA. RISC then cleaves 
the mRNA in the middle of 
the mRNA–siRNA duplex, 
and the resulting mRNA 
halves are degraded by other 
cellular enzymes. Under some 
circumstances, siRNAs might 
associate into complexes 
other than RISC (not shown) 
that function in the nucleus 
and silence gene transcription. 
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are 
processed from specific 
genome-encoded precursors, 
which fold into intramolecular 
hairpins containing 
imperfectly base-paired 
segments. The processing 
generally occurs in two 
steps, and is catalysed by 
the enzymes Drosha (in the 
nucleus) and Dicer (in the 
cytoplasm). One strand of 
the resulting miRNA duplex, 
resembling an siRNA, then 
incorporates into a RISC-like 
miRNA–ribonucleoprotein 
(miRNP) complex. The main 
components of RISC and 
miRNPs are proteins of 
the Argonaute (Ago) family. 
Depending on the level of 
complementarity, miRNAs 
induce mRNA degradation or 
repress their translation. Unlike 
the siRNA pathway, miRNA￾mediated degradation is 
initiated by enzymatic removal 
of the mRNA poly(A) tail.
Piwi-associated RNAs 
(piRNAs) are generated 
from long, single-stranded 
precursors in a process 
independent of Drosha and 
Dicer. These small RNAs 
associate with a subfamily of 
Argonaute proteins called Piwi 
proteins. Tens of thousands of 
piRNAs have been identified, 
although they are far from 
understood. It is, however, 
known that, together with 
their Piwi partners, they are 
essential for the development 
of germ cells. H.G. & W.F.
Box 2 | Formation and function of small RNAs
Does our collection of small RNAs set 
us apart from other species?
Some miRNAs are highly conserved, but 
others vary greatly among organisms; some 
differ even among primates, for example 
between apes and humans. With the emerging 
view that regulation of protein activity could 
be as vital to evolution as fidelity of the protein 
sequence itself, it is tempting to speculate that 
miRNAs influence evolution. Relatively simple 
requirements for miRNA–mRNA interaction 
facilitate the development of new regulatory 
relationships between these sequences, possi￾bly contributing to the evolution of new func￾tions. Perhaps, therefore, it is not surprising 
that a large fraction of tissue-specific miRNAs 
operates in the brain.
Are small RNAs restricted to the cells 
in which they are made?
In C. elegans and plants, dsRNAs or siRNAs can 
move between cells or even longer distances. 
For example, siRNAs spread through the vas￾cular system of plants, which possibly aids their 
function in antiviral immunity. And in C. ele￾gans, an efficient system of siRNA amplification 
ensures the maintenance of gene silencing even 
after the initial ‘trigger siRNA’ is gone, allowing 
siRNA to spread to the organism’s progeny. A 
similar amplification system does not occur in 
mammals. As for miRNAs, their very specific 
localization patterns (Fig. 2), and the absence 
of developmental changes in C. elegans mutants 
of the dsRNA transport machinery, suggests 
that miRNAs are stationary.
Will small RNAs be useful as 
therapeutic agents or targets?
This is a hot topic of research. siRNAs have 
the potential to silence disease-relevant genes 
that cannot be shut down with available drugs. 
Moreover, the so-called oncomiRs — miRNAs 
that promote cancer — may themselves be 
targets for shut-down. But we are still a long 
way from translating activity observed in a 
defined experimental system into an effective 
therapeutic drug. One of the most problem￾atic issues is how to get small RNAs efficiently 
and specifically to their target site of action in 
the human body. But regardless of their thera￾peutic potential, siRNAs have already revolu￾tionized basic biomedical research. The use of 
synthetic siRNAs, or their short hairpin RNA 
or dsRNA precursors, allows researchers to 
repress the function of a gene of interest or 
even to perform genome-wide RNAi screens 
to unravel entire biological pathways with 
unprecedented ease and speed. 
So what of the future?
New classes of small RNAs continue to be dis￾covered, and it is unlikely that we have found 
them all. Even for the known classes, we often 
have only a very limited understanding of 
what they do and how they do it. Identifica￾tion of miRNA targets is another challenge, 
as is identifying other, currently hypothetical, 
modes of small-RNA action. Owing to their 
base-pairing potential, small RNAs could 
modify local mRNA structures, allowing for 
alternative mRNA splicing and modulating 
interactions of mRNAs with proteins. So watch 
this space. ■
