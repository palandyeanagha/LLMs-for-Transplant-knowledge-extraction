for hepatitis C with either IFN (n = 148) or IFN-free DAA (n = 368) after curative HCC treat￾ment; 78 IFN-treated patients and 347 IFN-free DAA-treated patients achieved sustained
virological response (SVR). The recurrence rate of HCC was compared between the antivi￾ral therapies. Logistic analysis and Cox proportional hazards analysis identified factors
associated with early recurrence of HCC within 24 weeks of antiviral therapy and recurrence
throughout the observation period, respectively.
Results
AFP at the completion of antiviral therapy, clinical stage of HCC, and non-SVR were inde￾pendent factors associated with early recurrence of HCC. Among patients who had
achieved SVR, the clinical stage of HCC and the level of AFP at completion of antiviral ther￾apy were independent factors associated with early recurrence of HCC. For recurrence
throughout the observation period in SVR patients, AFP at completion of antiviral therapy,
duration between last HCC treatment to antiviral therapy, and the number of treatments
were independent factors. There was no significant difference in the rate of early recurrence
of HCC or recurrence throughout the observation period between IFN and IFN-free DAA
treated patients.
Conclusions
There were no differences in the early recurrence rate of HCC between patients who under￾went IFN and those who underwent IFN-free DAA as antiviral therapies.
Introduction
Since the era in which interferon (IFN) was the standard treatment for hepatitis C, attempts
have been made to eliminate hepatitis C virus (HCV) following hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC) treatment, but it could be achieved in only a limited number of patients due to side
effects. Recently, dramatic progress has been made in anti-HCV therapies. It is now feasible to
achieve a sustained virological response (SVR) rate of 95% even in older patients or cirrhosis
patients with IFN-free direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy that has minimal side effects in
older patients and in cirrhosis patients [1], and antiviral therapy can now be performed easily
in patients who have undergone HCC treatment. It has been reported that the elimination of
HCV with IFN after curative treatment for HCV-associated HCC suppresses HCC recurrences
[2–5]. We have also found that it dramatically extends patients’ survival [6]. However, whether
a similar effect can be achieved with DAA therapy is unclear. Furthermore, potential increases
in unexpected early recurrence of HCC after HCV elimination have been reported with DAA
therapy [7,8]. With this background, the HCC recurrence rate was compared between those
who underwent IFN therapy and those who underwent IFN-free therapy after HCC treatment
in a large-scale cohort.
Methods
Patients
This was a multicenter study conducted by the Japanese Red Cross Hospital Liver Study
Group consisting of 22 hospitals. This study investigated 516 patients who underwent antiviral

therapy for hepatitis C after curative treatment for HCC. Antiviral therapy was given from
1999 to 2016, and all patients were followed for at least 24 weeks after antiviral therapy. The
study was registered in UMIN (no. 000014971), and the research protocol was approved by the
Ethics Review Board (Institutional Ethics Review Committee of Matsuyama Red Cross Hospi￾tal approval number: 422) of all participating institutions. All medications were open-label
drugs. All parts of the research were conducted in accordance with the principles in the Decla￾ration of Helsinki.
Antiviral treatment
Of the 516 patients, 148 were treated by an IFN-containing regimen, and 368 were treated by
an IFN-free DAA regimen. The IFN-containing regimen included IFN monotherapy (n = 6),
Peg-IFN monotherapy (n = 24), IFN plus ribavirin (RBV) (n = 9), peg-IFN plus RBV (n = 57),
and peg-IFN plus RBV plus protease inhibitor such as telaprevir, simeprevir, or vaniprevir
(n = 52). The IFN-free DAA regimen included asunaprevir (ASV) plus daclatasvir (DCV)
(n = 159), sofosbuvir (SOF) plus RBV (n = 51), paritaprevir/ombitasvir/ritonavir (n = 7), and
SOF/ledipasvir (LDV) (n = 151). The mean follow-up period after antiviral therapy was 25.5
months for the IFN group and 7.7 months for the IFN-free DAA group.
Analysis of recurrence
Factors associated with early recurrence that appeared within 24 weeks of completing antiviral
therapy were assessed in all registered patients. An identical analysis was also conducted in the
subgroup of patients who achieved SVR. Furthermore, in SVR patients, recurrence during the
entire observation period was analyzed, and the difference in the recurrence rate between the
IFN group and the IFN-free DAA group was analyzed.
Statistical analysis
JMP ver.13.1.0 was used for statistical analysis, and the Mann-Whitney U test and the χ2 test
were used for comparisons between two groups. Logistic regression analysis was used to iden￾tify risk factors for early recurrence (within a half-year). A Cox proportional hazards model
was used to extract risk factors for recurrence with no restrictions on the follow-up period.
The Kaplan-Meier method was used for the HCC recurrence curves, and the log-rank test
was used to compare groups. A value of p < 0.05 was considered to indicate a significant
difference.
Results
Patients’ characteristics
The IFN-free DAA group was older, consisted of more women, and had longer duration from
the date of last HCC treatment to antiviral therapy, lower leukocyte count, lower hemoglobin
level, lower platelet count, lower albumin level, and higher Fib-4 index. However, data that
reflect the state of HCC, such as HCC stage and AFP level, were not different, and all other
clinical data were also not different (Table 1). SVR was achieved in 78/148 patients (52.7%) in
the IFN group and 347/368 patients (95.4%) in the IFN-free DAA group (Fig 1).
Early recurrence of HCC
Factors associated with early recurrence that appeared within 24 weeks of completing antiviral
therapy were analyzed in all registered patients. Univariate analysis showed that the type of
antiviral therapy (IFN treatment or IFN-free DAA therapy), albumin, PT, AST, AFP at

completion of antiviral therapy, duration from last HCC treatment to starting antiviral ther￾apy, number of past treatments for HCC, clinical stage of HCC, and SVR status were signifi￾cant factors. These factors were then subjected to multivariate analysis, which identified AFP
at completion of antiviral therapy, clinical stage of HCC, and SVR status as independent fac￾tors. IFN-free DAA therapy was not identified as an independent factor that contributed to
early recurrence within 24 weeks of antiviral therapy (Table 2).

Recurrence of HCC throughout the observation period in the SVR
subgroup
Factors associated with recurrence throughout the observation period, without restricting to
24-week early recurrence, were analyzed in SVR patients. Univariate analysis showed that
platelets, albumin, PT, AST, ALT, Fib-4 index, AFP at completion of antiviral therapy, dura￾tion from last HCC treatment to starting antiviral therapy, number of past treatments for
HCC, and number of HCC nodules were significant. However, the type of antiviral therapy
(IFN treatment or IFN-free DAA therapy) was not a significant factor. On multivariate analy￾sis, AFP at completion of antiviral therapy and duration from last HCC treatment to starting
antiviral therapy were identified as independent factors (Table 6). The AUROC for each item
is shown in Table 7. Kaplan-Meier analysis also did not demonstrate a significant difference
between the IFN group and the IFN-free DAA group (Fig 2). Propensity scores were calculated
with age, sex, FIB4, HCC stage, and the number of days from HCC treatment until the start
of antiviral treatment as covariates, and propensity score matching (1:1) was performed

HCV elimination with DAA therapy [7,8]. The present data have a strength in that they were
derived from a multicenter study that reflects the real-world data in Japan.

The SVR rate was as high as 94.3% in the IFN-free DAA-treated patients who had previ￾ously undergone HCC treatment. There is no doubt that IFN-free DAA therapy could be the
standard antiviral treatment in terms of viral cure. However, the question remains whether
DAA therapy in patients with a past history of HCC could be justified in terms of cost-effec￾tiveness or improvement of survival. One of the major concerns is that the suppression of de
novo HCC or recurrence of HCC may be weaker in IFN-free DAA regimens than in IFN-con￾taining regimens.
In contrast to DAA that simply blocks HCV replication, treatments containing IFN are
supposed to suppress HCV replication, to eliminate HCV-infected hepatocytes via immuno￾stimulation, and to have an anti-tumor effect [9]. Therefore, there may be differences in recur￾rence-suppressing effects when SVR is achieved with an IFN-free DAA regimen vs. an IFN￾containing regimen as postoperative adjuvant therapy after HCC treatment. In addition, there
have been recent reports indicating that the recurrence rate may be increased after DAA ther￾apy [8,9], as well as reports that contradict this [10–13]. A theoretical background for this
increased recurrence rate may be that patients develop an immune dysfunction immediately
following HCV eradication [14,15]. This can also be postulated based on reports of HBV re￾activation that occurs during or immediately after DAA therapy [16–18]. The disappearance
of hepatic lymphocyte infiltration associated with hepatitis eradication from the liver, as well
as decreases in endogenous IFN secretion, may be involved in this pathway.
Despite these theoretical concerns about the reduced efficacy of recurrence suppression by
IFN-free DAA regimens, the present study showed that the early recurrence rate of HCC was
not different between patients who underwent IFN and those who underwent IFN-free DAA
treatment. In the current investigation, the IFN-free DAA group was significantly older and
included more patients with advanced fibrosis. This indicates that the IFN-free DAA group
included more patients with a high risk of HCC recurrence. Nonetheless, there were no differ￾ences in the recurrence rate between IFN therapy and IFN-free DAA therapy in SVR patients.
This suggests that achieving SVR with IFN-free DAA therapy has a similar or greater effect in
suppressing HCC recurrence compared to achieving SVR with IFN therapy. Logistic regres￾sion and Cox proportional hazards model analysis identified factors associated with recur￾rence, such as HCC clinical stage, AFP at completion of antiviral therapy, and duration from
last HCC treatment to starting antiviral therapy. These factors reflect the HCC in its original
state, as well as after its treatment, indicating that the type of antiviral therapy did not contrib￾ute to its subsequent recurrence.
Although previous studies have shown that HCC recurrence was significantly suppressed
with IFN in patients who achieved SVR compared to non-SVR patients, the HCC recurrence
rate was still high after HCV elimination, indicating that HCV elimination cannot be an
endpoint in the treatment of HCV-associated HCC [19–26]. This indicates that there is an
extremely high carcinogenic potential in the non-cancerous portion of the liver in hepatitis C
patients who have previously developed HCC. HCV elimination may improve liver function,
leading to long-term survival in HCC patients, but it is not a sufficient condition for complete
suppression of HCC recurrence. Establishing standard measures to suppress HCC recurrence
after HCV eradication is desired. Furthermore, basic studies to assure the suppression of HCC
recurrence after HCV elimination are also necessary.
While it is important to study the survival rate in patients who have undergone DAA ther￾apy after HCC curative treatment, a sufficient observation period has not yet been achieved. In
a previous study during the IFN era in which we assessed patients who had undergone IFN
treatment for hepatitis C following HCC treatment, the survival rate was dramatically better in
the SVR group than in the non-SVR group [6]. This improvement in survival rate occurred
not only because mortality by liver failure was decreased due to improvement of liver function,

but also because treatment options for HCC recurrence expanded as a result of improved
hepatic reserve capacity, thereby enhancing curability. Therefore, an improvement in the sur￾vival rate can be fully anticipated in patients who achieve SVR with DAA therapy. While the
survival benefit for patients treated by DAA should be examined in the future, it is primarily
necessary to perform careful follow-up for HCC recurrence to achieve improvement of the
survival rate.
There are several limitations to this study. First, this was a retrospective cohort study. Sec￾ond, HCC curability and diagnosis of HCC recurrence were not strictly defined centrally and
were determined by the attending physician. Third, because the duration of antiviral therapy
differed depending on the regimen, there would have been a bias in either situation, whether
the recurrence of HCC was counted from before starting the therapy or whether it was counted
from after completing the therapy. However, understanding these limitations, we believe that
this study has significant value in that it investigated numerous patients who were treated in
actual clinical practice.
In conclusion, the HCC recurrence rate was compared between IFN therapy and IFN-free
DAA therapy in patients who previously underwent curative treatment for HCC, and no dif￾ferences were observed between the two groups. The outcomes of this study indicate that
IFN-free DAA therapy can be recommended as an anti-HCV method following HCC
treatment.
