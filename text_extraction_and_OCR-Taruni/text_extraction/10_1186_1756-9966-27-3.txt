Abstract
The acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is accompanied by a significant increase in the
incidence of neoplasms. Several causative agents have been proposed for this phenomenon. These
include immunodeficiency and oncogenic DNA viruses and the HIV-1 protein Tat. Cancer in
general is closely linked to genomic instability and DNA repair mechanisms. The latter maintains
genomic stability and serves as a cellular anti-cancer barrier. Defects in DNA repair pathway are
associated with carcinogenesis.
This review focuses on newly discovered connections of the HIV-1 protein Tat, as well as cellular
co-factors of Tat, to double-strand break DNA repair. We propose that the Tat-induced DNA
repair deficiencies may play a significant role in the development of AIDS-associated cancer.
AIDS and cancer
The development of neoplasms in AIDS is generally
assumed to be due to a failure of immune surveillance and
infections by oncogenic viruses. However, a growing body
of evidence suggests that HIV-1 and its proteins may play
a more direct role in tumor development.
Several types of cancer have been strongly associated with
the HIV-1 infection and AIDS. These are Kaposi sarcoma
(KS), lymphoproliferative disorders and cervical cancer
[1]. Kaposi sarcoma is the most common malignancy
associated with HIV-1 infection [1]. It can be observed at
any stage of the infection, although it occurs more fre￾quently in later stages when severe immune suppression
occurs [2]. KS is characterized by proliferation of spindle
cells, which seem to be of lymphatic endothelial origin. A
viral pathogenesis strongly contributes to KS and the
human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8 or KSHV – Kaposi's sar￾coma-associated herpesvirus) DNA virus was found to be
associated with KS [3-7]. In addition to HHV-8, it has
been suggested that the HIV-1 protein Tat may contribute
to the incidence and to the aggressive growth of KS [8]. Tat
is released from HIV-1-infected cells and may bind to cell
surfaces and enter uninfected cells [9-11]. One type of
cells that Tat is known to target is endothelial cells. Tat
induces angiogenesis and stimulates the growth of KS
spindle cells [1,10,12-14]. Overexpression of Tat in vivo
has been associated with the increase of KS-like lesions,
although this role of Tat in KS development has been con￾troversial [15]. In summary, Tat may act as a cofactor in KS
development, although its role in KS is at present unclear.
Two other types of cancer have been associated with AIDS.

high frequency and in 3% of HIV-1 infected patients, non￾Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is the initial manifestation of
AIDS. As is the case of KS, NHL in HIV-1-infected patients
was associated with a viral infection, in this case, Epstein￾Barr virus infection (EBV) [12]. Finally, invasive cervical
cancer is one of the most frequent complications of HIV￾1 infection in developing countries [16]. It appears that
cervical cancer in HIV-1 infected individuals is associated
with the HPV infection, as is true for cervical cancer in
general. Interestingly, the occurrence of this type of cancer
is not dependent on immune suppression. The disease is
aggressive in HIV-1 infected women, less responsive to
treatment and often recurrent [16]. There is no difference
in severity of cervical cancer in asymptomatic patients
with HIV-1 infection and those with AIDS [16]. These data
indicate that a failure of immune surveillance is not the
only mechanism behind cancer development in AIDS,
and that it may not be dependent on immune suppres￾sion. In contrast, it seems likely that HIV-1 infection and
HIV-1 proteins contribute to cancer development in HIV￾1-infected patients. This hypothesis is also supported by
the suggested role of Tat in development of Kaposi sar￾coma (see above). Although there is no evidence so far
regarding the role of Tat in AIDS-associated NHL and cer￾vical cancer, it cannot be excluded at present.
Finally, there are reports of increase in incidence of color￾ectal cancers in long-term AIDS survivors [17-22]. Color￾ectal cancer does not have a known viral etiology.
Interestingly, Tat may play a role in development of this
type of cancer in HIV-1-infected patients [23]. The mech￾anism underlying this effect of Tat has to be yet fully elu￾cidated and we present below one possible mechanism
how Tat may affect cellular processes, which are closely
related to cancer development.
Sensing and repair of double-strand DNA breaks
Cells have developed many mechanisms to protect the
integrity of chromosomal DNA. These mechanisms are
important for cell and organism survival. Surveillance
protein complexes monitor the integrity of the genome.
Detection of aberrant DNA and chromosome structures
such as double-strand DNA breaks coordinately triggers
checkpoint pathways and DNA repair systems [24]. Acti￾vation of a DNA damage checkpoint results in cell cycle
arrest, allowing time for DNA repair. Cells posses many
DNA repair systems, which are designed to recognize and
repair specific types of DNA damage. For example, ioniz￾ing radiation induces single-strand and double-strand
DNA breaks [25]. If such DNA damage is not repaired, it
may result in the activation of programmed cell death
(apoptosis) or mutations, such as oncogenic transloca￾tions.
The most hazardous form of DNA damage is a double￾strand DNA break (DSB) [25-27]. Even one unrepaired
DSB has been reported to kill a DNA repair-deficient cell
[25-27]. In order to combat this potentially lethal DNA
lesion, cells have developed several mechanisms to repair
DSBs, which are important for cell and organism survival.
The cellular DNA damage response to DSBs is controlled
by three related serine/threonine kinases: ATM (ataxia tel￾angiectasia mutated), ATR (ATM and Rad3 related) and
DNA-PK (DNA-dependent protein kinase). These key
players of the DNA damage response are recruited to DSB
sites by other proteins, some of which appear to serve as
sensors of DSBs (Figure 1). The mechanism of recruitment
is specific to each kinase. ATM is recruited by the Mre11/
Rad50/Nbs1 (MRN) complex [28,29] by binding to the
carboxy-terminal motif of Nbs1 (product of the Nijmegen
breakage syndrome gene) and in turn phosphorylates the
Nbs1 protein. The Mre11 component of the complex
exhibits nuclease activity necessary for DSB repair (see
below, [30-34]). Current models propose that ATM￾dependent Nbs1 phosphorylation controls this process
[35]. The recruitment of ATR to the sites of DNA damage
depends on both ATRIP (ATR-interacting protein) and
replication protein A (RPA, [28,36,37]). RPA-coated sin￾gle-strand DNA (ssDNA) stimulates ATR binding to the
carboxy-terminal motif of ATRIP. Nevertheless, despite
binding to ssDNA, ATR is also involved in DSB repair. It
has been shown recently that ATR is recruited to sites of
DSBs in ATM- and MRN-dependent manner [35,38]. It
appears that the MRN complex processes DSBs to create
the RPA-coated ssDNA, which is needed for ATR recruit￾ment. However, the ATR-mediated DSB response is appar￾ently restricted to the S and G2 cell cycle phases [35]. DSBs
not only lead to recruitment of ATM and ATR to the sites
of DNA damage, but also to their activation [39]. Acti￾vated ATM phosphorylates the Chk2 kinase and p53.
Phosphorylation of these proteins leads to either p53-
dependent (in G1) or p53-independent growth arrest (in
S and G2 cell cycle phases). ATR, on the other hand, phos￾phorylates the Chk1 protein, which, together with Chk2,
again induces cell cycle arrest, allowing time for DSB
repair [40]. Finally, the third member of the group, DNA￾PK, is a trimer consisting of the ATM- and ATR-related
DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA￾PKCS), and the Ku80/Ku70 heterodimer [41]. DNA-PKCS is
recruited to the sites of DSBs by binding to the carboxy￾terminal motif of the Ku80 (also referred to as Ku86) pro￾tein, subsequently, DNA-PK is activated [42]. Unlike ATM
and ATR however, DNA-PK does not appear to be
required for cell cycle arrest, and it's action is restricted to
the site of DSB [41].
DSB repair is mediated by two major repair systems in
mammalian cells. Similar to yeast, mammalian cells can

perform homologous recombination (HR) [43]. In this
process, a broken DNA molecule can be repaired by cop￾ying from an unbroken sister chromatid template, which
is most effective following S-phase. The second major
pathway, called non-homologous end joining (NHEJ),
only a minor pathway in yeast, but the most significant
pathway of DSB repair in mammalian cells [44]. NHEJ
joins DSBs without the requirement for homology, by
bringing together blunt ends of the broken double helix.
However as a result of this mechanism, NHEJ is more
error prone than HR.
In addition to their role in the activation of cell cycle
checkpoints, the ATM and ATR kinases are directly
involved in DSB repair. They phosphorylate the BRCA1
protein and the histone H2A variant termed H2AX [45-
51]. BRCA1 is an essential player in homologous double￾strand break DNA repair and physically associates with
proteins implicated in this DNA repair system, including
Rad51 [50].
The phosphorylated histone H2AX, termed γH2AX,
appears very early at the sites of DNA damage in chroma￾Model for the role of Tip60 in DSB repair Figure 1
Model for the role of Tip60 in DSB repair. Tip60 appears to play a role in DSB repair through its acetyltransferase activ￾ity. Tip60 displays HAT (histone acetyltransferase) activity by acetylating histones H2A and H4 (nucleosomes are represented 
by green barrels) which may have important consequences in response to DSBs. Tip60 has been suggested to play a direct role 
in the activation ATM (a crucial DSB repair protein kinase) by acetylating it in response to DNA damage. Following the induc￾tion of DNA damage, Tip60 has also been shown to associate with ATM. In addition, Tip60 is an indispensable regulator of p53 
function and acetylates transcription factors, which may play a role in DNA damage response pathways. Tat may influence all of 
these events, because it inhibits Tip60 activity and regulates Tip60 degradation.

tin [52,53]. It is believed that this histone modification is
required for the accumulation of DNA repair proteins,
such as Rad51, at the sites of DNA damage [54]. Phospho￾rylation occurs in the C-terminal tail of this histone, and
also a consensus site for PI-3K-related kinases. ATM is a
principal kinase responsible for H2AX phosphorylation at
the sites of DSBs, but ATR, and also DNA-PK, have been
suggested to play a role in γH2AX formation as well
[46,51]. Finally, as noted above ATM phosphorylates
Nbs1 [49,55-57]. This phosphorylation is required for
DNA damage response, possibly by enhancing homolo￾gous recombination [35,55-58]. Similar to ATM, it has
been shown that ATR may phosphorylate Nbs1 [59].
In contrast to ATM and ATR, DNA-PK is a critical compo￾nent of the NHEJ pathway. NHEJ is thought to be effective
at any time during the cell cycle [60,61], but, unlike HR,
may be most efficient during G1/early S phase when a
peak in DNA-PK activity is observed [62]. Other core
NHEJ components include the Artemis protein, and DNA
ligase IV in association with Xrcc4 [41]. The Xrcc4/Ligase
IV complex functions as a tetramer and is required for the
final ligation of DNA ends [63,64]. The manner in which
these, and other proteins that participate in NHEJ assem￾ble at the sites of DNA lesions, how their activities are
coordinated, and details of their catalytic mechanisms
have yet to be fully understood. However, it has been
shown that DNA-PK may phosphorylate linker histones
and this process may lead to localized histone H1 release,
coupled with the recruitment of Xrcc4/Ligase IV complex
[41,65]. The Artemis protein is an ATM substrate and thus
seems to link the ATM pathway and NHEJ [66,67]. The
ATM-dependent phosphorylation increases the Artemis
exonuclease activity and thus may help processing of DNA
ends during the DSB repair [67].
Double-strand break DNA repair and cancer
It has been known for a long time that patients carrying
mutations in certain DNA repair genes also suffer from an
increased incidence of cancer [68]. One example of such
mutation is ataxia telangiectasia (A-T), which results from
the ATM gene mutations, as noted above. A-T patients suf￾fer from a range of tumors [69]. Likewise, a subset of
breast cancer patients carries mutations in an ATM sub￾strate, the BRCA1 protein [70]. In addition, it has been
shown recently that a deletion of the H2AX gene in mice
results in an increased incidence of tumors in p53-defi￾cient background [71]. These findings place the ATM
kinase and at least some of its substrates into a class of
caretaker genes, or guardians of the genome, which offer
protection from cancer-causing mutations.
Only a small fraction of population carries ATM or BRCA1
mutations [69,70]. Thus, it has not been clear what role
these genes play in the development of cancer in patients
that do not carry a mutation in these genes. However, two
very recent publications in Nature showed that clinical
specimens from different stages of human tumors of the
urinary tract, lung, colon and breast express activated
markers of the ATM- and ATR-dependent DNA damage
response [72,73]. These markers are phosphorylated sub￾strates of ATM and ATR proteins. In addition, it has been
shown that expression of several oncogenes induces ATM￾and ATR-dependent DNA damage response in cultured
cells. These and other data indicate that early in tumori￾genesis, before malignant conversion, human cells acti￾vate the ATM- and ATR-dependent DNA damage
response, which delays or prevents cancer [72]. Mutations
that inactivate this response, may allow cell proliferation,
increased genomic instability and tumor progression. The
ATM and ATR pathway thus serves as a crucial cellular
anti-cancer barrier.
In contrast to ataxia telangiectasia, no such cancer-prone
disease was associated with NHEJ. One likely reason is
that a mutation in NHEJ has such debilitating effects that
most carriers of this mutation die before they reach the
stage when cancer could develop. However, NHEJ genes
have been the subject of animal studies and transgenic
knock out models were developed, Ku80 knock out and
Xrcc4 knock out being examples discussed here.
Mice lacking Ku80 are viable, but develop severe immun￾odeficiency, which seems to be the most pressing problem
in these animals [74]. Xrcc4-deficient mice also show a
severe deficit in lymphoid development, however, they
die in late embryonic development due to widespread
neuronal apoptosis. Interestingly, a lack of p53 can "res￾cue" Xrcc4-deficient mice, but this is a short reprieve, since
these double-deficient mice develop B-cell lymphomas at
an early age, leading to their death within three months
after birth [75]. A similar phenotype was observed for
Ku80 -and p53-deficiecint mice [76]. Cells from these ani￾mals exhibit severe genomic instability, resulting in chro￾mosomal rearrangements [76]. Thus, similar to ATM and
ATR, NHEJ proteins serve as guardians of the genome,
protecting genomic stability.
Taken together, ATM-, ATR-, and NHEJ-dependent DNA
damage response plays a central role in tumorigenesis and
agents that disrupt this response may lead to the develop￾ment of cancer.
Tat protein and the human cell
Tat is a cationic 86–101 amino acid polypeptide encoded
by HIV-1 [77]. Tat functions as a transacting transcrip￾tional activator and is involved in initiation of transcrip￾tion and RNA elongation involving cellular proteins and
the TAR region of HIV-1 RNA [10,78,79]. It was noted
early on that Tat is released from HIV-1-infected cells [59]

and can be detected in the serum of HIV-1-infected indi￾viduals at concentrations ranging from 0.1–1 ng/ml [80].
The extracellular Tat protein binds to cell surfaces. This
binding is mediated by electrostatic forces, and also by
binding to integrin and chemokine receptors [81,82]. In
addition, Tat can be taken up by human cells and localizes
to the nucleus [9,83]. The Tat protein induces different
biological responses in diverse target cells. For example,
Tat is known to induce expression of chemokine receptors
on T-cells and is also known to act as a neurotoxin. Some
of these effects are mediated by binding to cell surface
receptors, whereas others could be possibly mediated by
its interactions with cellular proteins within the cell
nucleus [14].
Tat and DNA repair
Although interactions of Tat with cellular proteins are
widely studied, little is known about effects of Tat on cel￾lular DNA repair. Tat was shown to induce the expression
of the DNA polymerase beta gene, which encodes a key
protein in the DNA base-excision repair pathway [84].
Expression of this gene was shown to be increased in
AIDS-related lymphomas [84].
In addition to regulation of DNA polymerase beta gene,
Tat was also implied to play a role in DSB DNA repair,
since cellular extracts containing the Tat protein have a
reduced ability to re-join linearized DNA [85]. This find￾ing implies a role for Tat in the regulation of the DNA
damage response to double-strand DNA breaks.
Tat and DNA-PK
An additional piece of evidence for the Tat role in the sup￾pression of double-strand DNA break repair came from
Tat-expressing rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines [86]. In these
cells, Tat induced increased sensitivity to ionizing radia￾tion, which is a major source of double-strand DNA
breaks. In addition, a comet assay and an analysis of
γH2AX foci revealed reduced repair of double-strand DNA
breaks. Lastly, Tat-expressing cells showed an extended
G2/M growth arrest in response to ionizing radiation,
again indicating a defect in DSB repair. A microarray anal￾ysis showed that Tat repressed expression of DNA-PKcs,
which is a major NHEJ component, as noted above [86].
Taken together, these data show that Tat blocks cellular
DSB repair, and this may be associated with low endog￾enous levels of DNA-PKcs. However, Tat may affect DSB
repair in yet another way, as described below.
Tat and Tip60
The cellular protein Tip60 (Tat interactive protein) was
originally discovered as a protein interacting with HIV-1
Tat [87]. However, since that time, Tip60 became a major
object of study in its own right, since it influences critical
cellular processes even in the absence of Tat [88-94].
Moreover, Tip60 is linked to a number of cancers [95].
Tip60 possesses histone acetyltrasferase (HAT) activity
and appears to target lysine residues of nucleosomal H2A
and H4 [96]. Tip60 is predominantly nuclear and has
both transcriptional and DNA repair functions, which will
be described in detail below.
Tip60 is involved in multiple steps of the cellular DNA
damage response. Similarly to p53, Tip60 is a target of the
human Mdm2 protein, which catalyzes Tip60 ubiquitina￾tion and proteosomal degradation [91]. Second, like p53,
Tip60 also accumulates after DNA damage [92]. However,
the strongest piece of evidence for Tip60 interaction with
the p53 pathway came from a large RNAi screen, which
showed that Tip60 was essential to p53-dependent G1/S
growth arrest [88]. Tip60 is also involved in up-regulation
of p53-responsive genes for p21 and GADD45 proteins
and Mdm2 [97]. As shown in Figure 1, p53 induces either
growth arrest or apoptosis. The molecular mechanism
underlying this p53 choice is not yet fully elucidated.
However, it has been shown very recently that Tip60
acetylates the lysine 120 residue of p53 [94]. This modifi￾cation is required for p53-induced apoptosis, but dispen￾sable for p53-mediated growth arrest [94]. Taken
together, Tip60 is an indispensable regulator of p53 func￾tion.
The second point of interaction of Tip60 with DSB repair
is the ATM kinase (Figure 1). ATM autophosphorylation is
required for separation of the inactive ATM dimmer into
active monomers [39]. It has been reported recently that
Tip60 forms a stable complex with ATM and in response
to DSBs acetylates the ATM protein [93]. Acetylation by
Tip60 is required for activation of the ATM kinase, auto￾phosphorylation and phosphorylation of downstream
ATM substrates, such as p53 and Chk2 [93]. The interac￾tion of Tip60 and ATM is not regulated by DNA damage
and activation of Tip60 by DNA damage and the recruit￾ment of the ATM-Tip60 complex to sites of DNA damage
is independent of ATM's kinase activity [93]. Tip60 is thus
involved in regulation of and acts upstream of a critical
component of cellular DSB repair. However, the ATM￾Tip60 interaction remains to be fully understood, since it
has been reported that Tip60 knockdown in Drosophila
does not impair phosphorylation of H2Av (equivalent of
human H2AX, which is a major ATM substrate) [98].
Finally, it has been shown very recently that transgenic
mice that are heterozygous for a Tip60 knockout allele
(Tip60+/-) exhibit severely impaired oncogene-induced
DNA damage response, which is ATM- and ATR-depend￾ent [[95] see above also]. Surprisingly, cells from Tip60+/-
did not have a general deficit in DNA damage response to
DSBs (ionizing radiation), which could be inferred based
on the defect in oncogene-induced DNA damage
response. These latter data thus seemingly contradict the

Journal of Experimental & Clinical Cancer Research 2008, 27:3 http://www.jeccr.com/content/27/1/3
Page 6 of 8
(page number not for citation purposes)
above report indicating that Tip60 is required for ATM
activation in response to DSBs. However, it has to be
pointed out that the Tip60+/- mice still had one active
Tip60 allele and it is thus possible that what is observed is
a dose-dependent effect and an additional Tip60 inhibi￾tion is required to see its role in DNA damage response to
DSBs. Unfortunately, homozygous embryos that lack
Tip60 die before implantation, thus complicating the
analysis. In summary, two lines of evidence suggest that
Tip60 interacts with ATM and regulates the ATM-depend￾ent DNA damage response, although some aspects of this
interaction remain to be clarified.
Cellular DNA is packaged together with histones into
chromatin, and the chromatin structure may affect sens￾ing and repair of DSBs. Acetylation of histones is thought
to "open" the chromatin structure DNA to DNA repair
proteins. Tip60 was shown to acetylate histone H4 at the
DSB sites [92]. Lack of Tip60-dependent H4 acetylation
can be apparently complemented by chromatin relaxation
by different means, indicating that the Tip60 increases
chromatin accessibility. Acetylation of histone H4 is thus
yet another point of interaction of Tip60 with DSB repair.
Finally, Kusch et al. reported that Tip60 is required in Dro￾sophila for selective histone exchange at DSB sites [98].
Specifically, Tip60 acetylates phosphorylated histone
H2Av (as noted above, H2AX equivalent) and exchanges
it with unmodified H2Av. Tip60 thus participates in DSB
repair by yet another mechanism, although the role of
acetylation and subsequent exchange of H2Av in DSB
repair has yet to be fully understood.
Tat and Tip60 interaction and consequences
As noted above, Tip60 was originally identified as a Tat￾intereacting protein [87]. Tip60 does not affect Tat￾dependent transactivation of the HIV-1 LTR promoter
[99]. However, Tat blocks the HAT activity of Tip60 [99].
Interestingly, a new mechanism of Tip60 neutralization
by Tat has been recently reported, where Tat induces poly￾ubiquitination and degradation of Tip60 [89]. Tip60
ubiquitination is dependent in this process on the newly
reported p300/CBP-associated E4-type ubiquitin-ligase
activity [89]. Therefore, the presence of the Tat protein is
likely to inhibit Tip60 function (Figure 1). Given the mul￾tiple roles of Tip60 in DSB repair, it seems likely that Tat
may exert effects on DSB repair. These effects may be det￾rimental to DSB repair and eventually lead either to apop￾tosis or to mutations when cells are exposed to DSB￾inducing agents or environmental factors.
Summary
In this article, we summarize several functions of Tat and
its interacting proteins in cellular DNA repair. We suggest
that Tat may, by regulating its cellular targets, affect cellu￾lar DSB repair, the consequences of which could be
genomic instability, which may give rise to mutations and
contribute to development of cancer. Experiments are
underway in our laboratories to investigate Tat role(s) in
DSB repair. It is hoped that this review will stimulate fur￾ther study in this underexplored, yet potentially impor￾tant field.
