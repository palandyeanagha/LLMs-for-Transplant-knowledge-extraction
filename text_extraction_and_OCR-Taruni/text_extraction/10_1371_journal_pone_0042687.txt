Abstract
Purpose: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been utilized for critically ill patients, such as those with life￾threatening respiratory failure or post-cardiotomy cardiogenic shock. This study compares the predictive value of Acute
Physiology, Age, and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), and Organ
System Failure (OSF) obtained on the first day of ECMO removal, and the Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) stages
obtained at 48 hours post-ECMO removal (AKIN48-hour) in terms of hospital mortality for critically ill patients.
Methods: This study reviewed the medical records of 119 critically ill patients successfully weaned from ECMO at the
specialized intensive care unit of a tertiary-care university hospital between July 2006 and October 2010. Demographic,
clinical, and laboratory data were collected retrospectively as survival predictors.
Results: Overall mortality rate was 26%. The most common condition requiring ECMO support was cardiogenic shock. By
using the areas under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve, the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA)
score displayed good discriminative power (AUROC 0.80560.055, p,0.001). Furthermore, multiple logistic regression
analysis indicated that daily urine output on the second day of ECMO removal (UO24–48 hour), mean arterial pressure (MAP),
and SOFA score on the day of ECMO removal were independent predictors of hospital mortality. Finally, cumulative survival
rates at 6-month follow-up differed significantly (p,0.001) for a SOFA score#13 relative to those for a SOFA score.13.
Conclusions: Following successful ECMO weaning, the SOFA score proved a reproducible evaluation tool with good
prognostic abilities.

Introduction
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been
utilized in critically ill patients such as those with severe, reversible
myocardial dysfunction and life-threatening respiratory failure.
Patients on ECMO usually experience multi-organ failure and
thus have high mortality [1]. Independent prognostic factors and
outcome scoring systems for predicting hospital mortality for
patients on the first day of ECMO support [2] and those already
on ECMO support [3] have been elucidated. However, outcome
predictors for patients weaning from ECMO remain unclear.
Given promising new treatment methods bridged to a
ventricular assist device or transplant and limited medical
resources, investigators and physicians require reliable tools for
monitoring and stratifying risk for critically ill patients in clinical
practice and clinical trials. However, to date no study has clarified
the relationship between patients being weaned from ECMO
support and their short term prognosis. Therefore, this study
investigated the prognostic factors and compared the accuracy of
the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE)
II [4], Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) [5], Organ
System Failure (OSF) number [6], and Acute Kidney Injury
Network (AKIN) stages [7] for predicting hospital mortality and
short-term prognosis in patients being weaned from ECMO
support.
Materials and Methods
Patient information and data collection
The Institutional Review Board at Chang Gung Memorial
Hospital approved the study and waived the need for consent. All
data in our study was anonymized. Between July 2006 and
October 2010, 124 patients received ECMO support and
experienced ECMO weaning via a 20-bed specialized cardiovas￾cular surgery intensive care unit (CVS ICU). Those who were
weaned off ECMO support but died within 48 hours (5 patients)
were defined as unsuccessfully weaned and excluded. Medical

records of 119 patients who were successfully weaned from
ECMO support were examined.
The following retrospective data were obtained: demographic
data; primary diagnosis for ECMO implementation; whether the
patient was currently being weaned off ECMO support; APACHE
II, SOFA score, and OSF number on the first day of ECMO
support and the day of ECMO removal, respectively; AKIN stage
(AKIN48-hour) at 48 hours post-ECMO removal; duration of
hospitalization; and outcome. The primary study outcome was
hospital mortality. Follow-up at 6 months after hospital discharge
was performed via chart records.
Definitions
Successful weaning was defined as weaning from ECMO
support followed by survival longer than 48 hours [8]. Illness
severity was assessed using APACHE II [4]. Physiological
calculations utilized the worst physiological values on the first
day of ECMO support and on the day of ECMO weaning. Organ
function was assessed using SOFA score and OSF number, which
were defined as in the original reports [5], [6]. Acute kidney injury
was defined using the AKIN classification system, which requires
at least two serum creatinine (SCr) values within 48 h [7]. The
classification system comprises individual criteria for SCr levels
and urine output (UO). A patient can fulfill the criteria by
adjusting SCr concentrations, UO, or both. The baseline SCr
concentration used for AKIN classification was that at the time of
weaning off ECMO. The most anomalous values of each organ
system on the first day of ECMO support and on the day of
ECMO removal were recorded.
Clinical management
The ECMO device (Medtronic, Inc., Anaheim, CA) comprised
a centrifugal pump and a hollow-fiber microporous membrane
oxygenator with an integrated heater. All ECMO circuits had a
heparin-bound Carmeda bioactive surface. A hollow fiber
oxygenator (Hilite LT 700; Medos, Aachen, Germany) or a
silicone oxygenator (Medtronics, Minneapolis, MN, USA) was
incorporated into the ECMO circuit. Percutaneous cannulation
and cut-down procedures were necessary for some obese patients.
According to the body size of the patient, a 17–19 Fr percutaneous
arterial (outflow) cannulae and 19–21 percutaneous venous
(inflow) cannulae (DLP; Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis, MN) were
used. An 8 Fr distal perfusion catheter was implanted into the
ipsilateral superficial femoral artery if the cannulated limb showed
cyanosis.
For all patients, receiving ECMO support at least 48 hours
before weaning was attempted. If the patient’s hemodynamic and
general condition became stable with echocardiographic evidence
of improvement in left ventricular contractility (.40% of left
ventricular ejection fraction), an inotropic agent was then carefully
tapered. Moreover, the oxygen saturation was continuously
monitored until the mixed venous oxygen saturation was more
than 70% without any deterioration in hemodynamic status, and
the pump flow was reduced gradually to 500 ml/min for adult
patients and 20–25 ml/kg/min for pediatric patients. Finally,
ECMO was withdrawn when sustained stability was noted in a
patient’s hemodynamic status [9].
Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics are expressed as means 6 standard
deviation (SD) unless otherwise stated. Primary analysis compared
hospital survivors with non-survivors. All variables were tested for
normal distributions using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The
Student t-test was applied to compare means of continuous
variables and normally distributed data; otherwise, the Mann￾Whitney U test was employed. Categorical data were tested using
the x2 test. Risk factors were assessed via univariate analysis, and
statistically significant (p,0.05) variables were subjected to
multivariate analysis via multiple logistic regression with forward
data elimination.
Calibration was assessed using the Hosmer-Lemeshow good￾ness-of-fit test to compare the number of observed and predicted
deaths in risk groups for the entire range of death probabilities.
Discrimination was assessed using the area under the receiver
operating characteristic curve (AUROC). The AUROCs were
compared using a nonparametric approach. AUROC analysis was
also utilized to calculate cutoff values, sensitivity, specificity, and
overall correctness. Finally, cutoff points were calculated by
obtaining the best Youden index (sensitivity+specificity 21).
Cumulative survival curves as a function of time were generated
utilizing the Kaplan-Meier approach and compared using the log
rank test. All statistical tests were two-tailed, with the level of
significance set to p less than 0.05. Data were analyzed using SPSS
13.0 for Windows (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
Results
Subject characteristics
The study population comprised 119 patients who were
successfully weaned from ECMO support at the CVS ICU
between July 2006 and October 2010. Patient median age was 50
years old; 82 patients were male (69%) and 37 were female (31%).
In total, 112 patients were adults (94%) and seven were children or
neonates (6%). Overall in-hospital mortality was 26% (31/119).
Table 1 lists patient demographic data and the clinical character￾istics of both survivors and non-survivors. Table 2 lists primary
diagnosis for intensive care unit admission and the primary reason
for ECMO support. The most frequent indication for ECMO
support in this patient subset was cardiogenic shock (77%).
Calibration, discrimination, and correlation for illness
scoring systems
Table 3 lists goodness-of-fit measured using the Hosmer￾Lemeshow chi-square statistic of predicted mortality risk, and
the predictive accuracy of the AKIN48-hour, APACHE II, SOFA
score, and OSF number. Poor calibration of AKIN48-hour
(Hosmer-Lemeshow chi-square = 6.937, 2 df, p= 0.031) is noted.
Table 3 also compares the discriminative abilities of these scoring
systems. AUROC analysis confirms that the discriminative power
of SOFA score exceeds that of the AKIN48-hour, APACHE II, and
OSF number.
Hospital mortality and short-term prognosis
Univariate analysis identified 11 (Table 4) of 32 variables
(Table 1) as prognostically valuable. Multivariate analysis identi￾fied the following variables as having independent prognostic
significance: daily urine output on the second day following
ECMO removal (UO24–48 hour), MAP, and SOFA score on the
day of ECMO removal (Table 4). Regression coefficients of these
variables were used to calculate a logit of death for each patient, as
follows:

To assess the predictive value of each measure for hospital
mortality, sensitivity, specificity, and overall correctness of
prediction were determined. The SOFA score and AKIN48-hour
had the best Youden index and highest overall prediction
correctness (Table 5).
Figure 1A shows the cumulative rates of survival for the study
group dichotomized by 13 SOFA points or less/14 SOFA points
or more (p,0.001). Cumulative survival rates differed considerably
(p,0.001) between non-AKI and AKI (Figure 1B).
Discussion
The hospital mortality rate for patients who received ECMO
support around 60% [1–3] and experienced successful ECMO
weaning in this study was 26%. This investigation demonstrates
that MAP and SOFA score on the day of ECMO removal, and
daily urine amount on the second day after weaning from ECMO,
were strong predictors of in-hospital mortality (Table 4). The
SOFA score had better discriminatory power than the AKIN48-
hour, APACHE II and OSF number (Table 3). Moreover, the
SOFA score and AKIN48-hour had the best Youden index and
highest overall prediction accuracy (Table 5).
Urine volume is a more sensitive marker for early detection of
AKI than serum creatinine level. Decreased urine volume on the
day of ECMO removal is attributed to decreased cardiac output
following decannulation, and is correlated with acute cardiorenal
syndrome (CRS type 1) [10]. For patients with improved systolic
function, urine volume may increase gradually in the following
days; for other patients, decreased urine volume progresses and

causes fluid overload, which likely increases preload and may
contribute to circulatory failure. Additionally, loop diuretics were
usually prescribed for better diuresis in cases of decreased urine
volume. Metra et al. [11] identified the use of loop diuretics,
probably by further activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldoste￾rone system and possibly worsening intra-renal hemodynamics, as
one of the modifiable in-hospital determinants of CRS type 1.
Circulatory failure may further aggravate in-hospital mortality.
For patients weaned from ECMO, this study adopted the best
Youden index, and established a cut-off (urine volume of 1468 ml)
(Table 5). Hospital mortality rates below and above the cutoff
value of 1468 ml of daily urine volume on the second day of
ECMO removal were 59.5% (22/37) and 12.5% (9/72) (p,0.001),
respectively.
Mehta and colleagues [12] reported that blood pressure is a key
bedside tool for predicting postoperative dialysis risk in patients
undergoing cardiac surgery. Hypotension is related to worsening
renal function for patients weaned from ECMO support.
Damaged cardiac function leads to low cardiac output and,
therefore, hypoperfusion, and may precipitate pre-renal AKI,
which, if not promptly corrected, can evolve into intrinsic AKI and
even cortical necrosis, resulting in irreversible loss of renal function
[13], [14]. Analytical results demonstrate that MAP on the day of
ECMO removal is an independent risk factor for patients weaned
from ECMO. This investigation applied the best Youden index
and a recognized MAP cut-off value of 69 mmHg (Table 5).
Hospital mortality rates differed considerably according to the best
Youden index was below or above the cutoff of 69 mmHg of MAP
(34.6% vs. 9.8%, p= 0.003).
Ceriani et al. [15] concluded that SOFA was applicable in
cardiac surgery without requiring specific modifications based on
the good results they obtained in 218 patients. Belohlavek and
colleagues [16] reported that patients who died on ECMO had
higher SOFA scores (14.861.6 vs. 10.861.5; p= 0.0065). Wu et al.
[17] also stated that SOFA score before ECMO implantation
exceeding 14 predicted mortality. For patients successfully weaned
from ECMO, this study adopted the best Youden index, and
established a cut-off value of 13 for SOFA score (Table 5).
Hospital mortality rates differed significantly below and above this
cut-off value (13.2% vs. 67.9%, p,0.001). This study demonstrated
that SOFA score exceeding 13 on the day of ECMO removal

predicted hospital mortality, a result compatible with previous
studies.
Acute kidney injury following cardiac surgery is a well￾recognized complication that occurs in up to 40% of patients
and requires dialysis in 1% of cases [18]. Patients who develop
AKI have high mortality and resource utilization. Emerging
evidence suggests that even small increases in creatinine following
cardiac surgery are associated with significantly increased mortal￾ity. Following weaning from ECMO for 48 hours, hospital
mortality rates differed significantly between patients with AKI
vs. those without AKI (45.1% vs. 6.5%, p,0.001).
Despite the promising study results, this study has several
important limitations. First, this was a retrospective study
performed at a single tertiary-care medical center, limiting the
generalizability of the findings. Second, this retrospective study
suffered difficulties associated with the unavailability of certain
laboratory data, including serum sodium, albumin, and troponin-I
levels. Third, the patient group comprised patients weaned from
ECMO excluding those who died within 48 hours of weaning;
therefore, our results may not be directly extrapolated to other
patient populations. Furthermore, the prognostic markers results
are only applied for patients surviving 48 hours of ECMO
removal. Fourth, the patient population contained a high
proportion of cardiogenic shock patients (77%) (Table 2) and
may present as a special subgroup of patients on ECMO. Besides,
different prognostic markers might be identified in ARDS patients
(23%) weaned from ECMO support, such as alveolar-arterial O2-
tension difference or PaO2/FiO2 ratio. Fifth, because of the
relatively small sample size, sensitivity, specificity and the
predictive accuracies derived from the ‘‘best cut-off point’’ require

Figure 1. Cumulative survival rate for 119 critically ill patients based on (A) sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score on
the day of ECMO removal and (B) acute kidney injury (AKI) or not based on changes over the course of 48 hours after ECMO
removal. AKI defined as in the AKIN48-hour classification system with stage 1, 2 and 3.

further external validation. Sixth, the predictive accuracy of
logistic regression models has its own limitations. Finally,
sequential measurement of these scoring systems (such as, daily or
weekly) may reflect the dynamic aspects of clinical diseases, thus
providing superior information for outcome prediction.
In conclusion, this study observed a hospital mortality rate of
26% in critical ill patients weaned from ECMO support.
According to the analytical results, the risk of mortality increases
with decreasing urine volume, low MAP, and high SOFA score at
the time of ECMO removal. Our data also demonstrate the good
discriminative power of SOFA score to predict hospital mortality
of critically ill patients weaned from ECMO support. We
recommend physicians use SOFA score to assess short-term
prognosis in this subset of patients.
