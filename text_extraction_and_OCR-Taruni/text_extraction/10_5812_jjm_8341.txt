Background: Acinetobacter baumannii plays a significant role in nosocomial infections. Multidrug-resistant A. baumannii is recognized to 
be among the most difficult antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative bacilli to be controlled and treated. For this reason we examined the 
efficacy of nanosilver material with strong disinfectant properties against different types of bacteria.
Objectives: The purpose of this study was to examine the antibacterial activity of silver nanoparticles and compare them with some 
antibiotics against clinically isolated A. baumannii bacteria.
Materials and Methods: 60 A. baumannii strains were isolated from clinical specimens of university hospitals in Tehran province of 
Iran. The susceptibility test against 18 different antibiotics was investigated by disk diffusion methods. Colloidal nanosilver with about 
6-34 nm particle size was prepared by chemical method. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal 
concentration (MBC) effect of nanosilver on A. baumannii were assessed at serially diluted nanosilver concentrations and compared to 
different antibiotics.
Results: The findings showed a 100% resistance of A. baumannii to different antibiotics, including piperacillin, cefixime, ceftazidime, 
ceftizoxime, cephepim and clavulanat, and more than 90% resistance against imipenem, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin and 
cotrimoxazole and lower resistance was seen against nitrofurantoin (62.8%), gatifloxacin (56.85%), levofloxacin (55.18%), gentamycin 
(29.32%), piperacillin/tazobactam (13.34%), meropenem (13.16%) and amikacin (12.07%). MIC and MBC mean value of nanosilver dilutions 
were determined as 27.34 ppm and 54.68 ppm, respectively. All isolates (100%) were susceptible to more than MIC of nanosilver in contrast 
showed high resistance to multiple classes of antibiotics.
Conclusions: We conclude that nanosilver is a strong bactericidal agent to Multidrug resistant A. baumannii bacteria, so it can be useful 
to prevent a variety of nosocomial infections.

1. Background
The genus Acinetobacter includes Gram-negative cocco￾bacilli, with a DNA G+C content of 39 to 47 mol%, which 
are strictly aerobic, nonmotile, catalase positive and oxi￾dase negative and has been divided into16 genome spe￾cies (1, 2). Acinetobacter species are capable of colonizing 
and infecting human beings. They have been involved in 
a variety of nosocomial infectious diseases. Acinetobacter 
baumannii has become a particularly important organ￾ism in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) (3). Infections occur 
in the respiratory and urinary tract, peritoneum, surgical 
wounds, skin and eyes. Bacteremia and secondary men￾ingitis with mortality rates from 20% to 27% were seen in 
several cases (1). They have been reported to be thecom￾mon agents of nosocomial pneumonia, particularly ven￾tilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in hospital ICUs (3, 4).
A.baumannii were shown to have the propensity to toler￾ate drying and resist multiple classes of antibiotics and

these are the key factors enabling the organism to survive 
and spread in the nosocomial environment. In general, 
the treatment of A. baumannii infections are often ex￾tremely difficult because of their widespread resistance 
to the major groups of antibiotics (1).
Resistance to antimicrobial agents by pathogenic bacte￾ria has emerged in the recent years and is a major health 
problem. Nanosilver is one of the most commonly used 
nanomaterials due to its strong disinfectant properties 
(5); it has a much stronger germicidal capability which 
can kill up to 650 different types of bacteria (6). The in￾hibitory effect of ionic silver is due to several biological 
events such as attachment to cell membranes, alteration 
of membrane permeability through adsorption to the 
negatively charged bacterial cell wall, generating reactive 
oxygen species (ROS), and deactivating cellular enzymes 
(7). The American Biotech Labs have spent millions of dol￾lars on testing the safety and efficacy of nanosilver tech￾nology products. All studies have concluded that nanosil￾ver products are not toxic to cells, animals or humans (8). 
No toxic effects on human’s tissues were reported by low 
concentration of nanosilver solutions (9).
2. Objectives
The purpose of this study was to examine the antibac￾terial activity of silver nanoparticles and compare them 
with some antibiotics against clinically isolated A. bau￾mannii.
3. Materials and Methods
60 bacterial strains were isolated from clinical speci￾mens. A. baumannii were isolated from wound, trachea, 
blood, sputum, pleura, urine and CSF from 8 hospitals 
in the Tehran province of Iran. All strains were isolated 
on the usual culture medium, Mueller-Hinton agar (Pro￾nadisa Co. Italy), and after an overnight incubation at 
35°C, the differentiated test was used to detect the A. bau￾mannii bacteria. The oxidative activity of isolated speci￾mens was examined with biochemical by oxidase disk 
(Rosco Diagnostica A/S, Denmark). Biochemical capabili￾ties of this organism were tested on TSI (Triple sugar iron 
agar) and LD (Lysine decarboxylase) media. The isolates 
were classified as A. baumannii species based on oxidative 
negative, non-fermenter and non-motile. A. baumannii 
produces colonies with a 2-3mm diameter at 18-24 hours 
of incubation. A. baumannii did not produce acid from 
mannitol, sucrose and H2S on TSI media and had no reac￾tion on lysine decarboxylase medium (2, 10).
Antimicrobial Effects of Different Antibiotics on A. 
baumannii Bacteria: The susceptibility test against 18 
different antibiotics was investigated by the disk diffu￾sion method according to the CLSI, 2010 guidelines (11), 
used as the reference method for antimicrobial suscep￾tibility testing. Used Antibiotics: Amikacin, gentamycin, 
meropenem, piperacillin/tazobactam, gatifloxacin, levo￾floxacin, cotrimoxazole, nitrofurantoin, ciprofloxacin, 
imepenem, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ceftizoxime, clavu￾lanate, ceftriaxone, piperacillin, cefepime and cefixime. 
The Antimicrobial Effects of Nanosilver on A.baumannii: 
For preparation of nanosilver suspension; firstly silver 
nitrate was placed under the reducing effect of polyalde￾hyde, and thus Ag+ changed to metallic Ag after receiving 
an electron. Silver particles tend to accumulate together 
and to prevent this, an acrylic polymer was used in the 
presence of the surface water. The effect of this surface 
activator reduced the silver particles’ tendency to stick. 
So a solution with silver particles in the nanometer size 
was obtained. To confirm the particle size, intensity test 
was performed on the solution. The average size of silver 
particles was 6-34 diameters.
MIC was defined as the lowest concentration of nanosil￾ver preparation that prevented bacterial growth. MICs 
were determined for all strains by the CLSI reference 
method (11).Concentrations tested were serial twofold 
dilutions: 1 (3500 ppm), 1/2 (1750 ppm), 1/4 (875 ppm), 
1/8 (437.5 ppm), 1/16 (218.75 ppm), 1/32 (109.37 ppm), 1/64 
(54.68 ppm), 1/128 (27.34 ppm), 1/256 (13.67 ppm), 1/512 
(6.83 ppm), 1/1024 (3.41 ppm). Disk diffusion tests were 
performed along with MIC determinations using one in￾oculum preparation. The MBCs were determined accord￾ing to the methods outlined by the CLSI (11). The MBC was 
defined as the lowest concentration of compound that 
produced a ≥ 99.9% killing (≥ 3-log10) drop in CFU/ml 
compared to that of the starting inoculum. Two control 
samples were used to judge the validity of our work, one 
of them was free of nanosilver, and the other one was free 
from bacteria.
4. Results
We examined the A. baumannii growth in culture me￾dia in the presence of nanosilver compared to when the 
culture media contained different antibiotics; we found 
that nanosilver dilutions readily prevented growth of 
the multidrug resistant A.baumannii. The information 
about the susceptibility and resistance rate of the iso￾lates against the 18 different antibiotics used is shown 
in Table 1 and Figures 1, 2, 3, 4. This information shows 
the 100% resistance of A. baumannii against different 
antibiotics such as piperacillin, cefixime, ceftazidime, 
ceftizoxime, cephepim and clavulanat, more than 90% 
resistance against imipenem, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, 
ciprofloxacin and cotrimoxazole, and lower resistance 
against nitrofurantoin (62.8%), gatifloxacin (56.85%), le￾vofloxacin (55.18%), gentamycin (29.32%), piperacillin/
tazobactam (13.34%), meropenem (13.16%), and amikacin 
(12.07%). Nanosilver examinations showed that the MIC of 
nanosilver was 27.34 ppm (with average inhibition zone 
being 8.02 mm), and the MBC was 54.68 ppm (with aver￾age inhibition zone being 8.85 mm).

 Susceptibility to nanosilver depended on the concen￾tration. All isolates were susceptible to more than MIC 
of nanosilver compared to a high resistance to multiple 
classes of antibiotics. The Average of inhibition zone di￾ameters of different concentrations of nanosilver dilu￾tions is shown in Figure 3. By reducing the concentration 
of nanosilver, its effectiveness was reduced; at aboutthe 
1/128 concentration and lower, inhibition zone of bacte￾rial growth was not observed.

5. Discussion
The rising trend of resistance to antibiotics alarms 
about the dilemma that could be faced when treating 
such infections. The results showed that clinical isolates 
of A. baumannii in our hospitals are highly resistantto 
multiple classes of antibiotics. A. baumannii are impor￾tant opportunistic pathogens with increasing rates of 
multi-antibiotic resistance due to both intrinsic and 
acquired mechanisms. In this study we collected 60 
samples from different departments of eight university 
hospitals of Tehran. Several common antibiotics against 
A. baumannii were used for in vitro susceptibility test. 
This experiment revealed high resistance rates of 
A.baumannii, which were as follows: 100% to piperacillin, 
cefixime, ceftazidime, ceftizoxime, cephepim, and clavu￾lanat, more than 90% resistance to imipenem, cefotaxi￾me, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, and cotrimoxazole, more 
than 50% resistance to levofloxacin and gatifloxacin, low 
resistance to amikacin, meropenem, piperacillin/tazo￾bactam and gentamycin. Other researches in Iran have 
also shown the high multidrug resistance rates of A. bau￾mannii (12, 13). Other studies on A. baumannii have shown 
similar results with respect to these antibiotics (14-16). 
The resistance percentages reported by Gaur (17) against 
several antibiotics were different from ours including: 
ciprofloxacin (81%), cefotaxime (79%) ceftazidime (77.6%), 
amikacin (74.8%), imipenem (9.1%) andmeropenem (9.8%).
Other articles with different results include; the gh￾ulam study (18), imipenem and meropenem (70%), ami￾kacin (52.5%), ceftazidime, cefepime and ciprofloxacine 
(89%). moniri (19) showed 60% resistance against ami￾kacin, ceftazidim, and ciprofloxacin. There is a common 
significance to all these articles and that is their alarming 
results about the high resistance of A. baumannii against 
many used antibiotics. For this reason we decided to find 
a safe, effective and accessible material with strong effects 
on pathogenic microorganism. Nanosilver colloid was 
made with chemical methods. Size dependent antimi￾crobial activity of silver nanoparticles has been reported 
for Gram-negative bacteria (20-22). Small nanoparticles 
with a large surface area to volume ratio provide a more 
efficient means for antibacterial activity even at very low 
concentrations. Silver nanoparticles (Diameter 5-32 nm) 
enhance the antibacterial activity of various antibiotics 
(23).
Silver nanoparticles anchor and penetrate the cell wall 
of Gram-negative bacteria (21, 24). The resultant struc￾tural change in the cell membrane could cause an in￾crease in cell permeability, leading to an uncontrolled 
transport through the cytoplasmic membrane, and ulti￾mately cell death. It has also been proposed that the an￾tibacterial mechanism of silver nanoparticles is related 
to the formation of free radicals, and subsequent free 
radical-induced membrane damage (6). Ions move into 
the cells and lead to the production of reactive oxygen 
species. Based on the greater tendency of silver ions to 
strongly interact with thiol groups of vital enzymes and 
phosphorus-containing bases (25) and with the presence 
of silver nanoparticles inside the cells (21), it is likely that 
further damage could be caused by interactions with 
compounds such as the DNA. 
This interaction may prevent cell division and DNA rep￾lication, and ultimately lead to cell death. In this study 
we examined the nanosilver efficacy against A. bauman￾nii and its Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and 
Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC). Our results 
showed a 100% influence by the prepared nanosilver and 
27.34ppm MIC and 54.68ppm MBC. Numerous researches 
have been performed studying the effect of nanosilver on 
pathogenic microorganism, but there has not been any 
investigation on the effect of nanosilver on A.baumannii, 
and comparing its effects with different classes of antibi￾otics. Our resultswere quiet similar to the Humberto (26) 
study on Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
The MIC calculation for another gram negative bacteria, 
Escherichia coli, was reported later by Amany (27) and 
Petrus (28), which was similar to our results. In conclu￾sion silver nanoparticle is a strong bactericide agent to 
the multidrug resistant A. baumannii strains, which is an 
important cause of hospital acquired infections. Thus, 
preparing new bactericidal agents in combination with 
nanosilver particles can be a useful route for introduc￾ing new antibiotics to prevent a variety of nosocomial 
infections. Finally, nanosilver products can be used for 
an effective prevention and treatment of some infectious 
diseases.
