Introduction
During critical illness, patients who are immobilized for 
more than a few days develop neuromuscular weakness 
despite receiving full supportive care, which may include 
physical therapy [1-6]. In patients requiring mechanical 
ventilation for longer than 7 days, the incidence of ICU￾acquired (neuromuscular) weakness is reported to be 
between 25 and 60% (Table 1) [1,7,8]. Such weakness may 
contribute to increased duration of mechanical 
ventilation, increased length of stay in the ICU and 
hospital, and poor quality of life among survivors [9-11]. 
Th ese data suggest that any interventions which may 
attenuate such weakness and/or shorten the duration of 
recovery have the potential to improve both the quality of 
life of patients and reduce healthcare costs. Early 
mobilization (EM) may represent one such intervention.
In general terms, EM of ICU patients includes the 
application of traditional modes of physical therapy at an 
earlier stage than and delivered more regularly than 
conventional practice, and/or the early use of novel 
mobilization techniques (for example, cycle ergometry, 
transcutaneous electrical muscle stimulation). EM appears 
physiologically logical in patients who would otherwise 
remain almost immobile, and may also be a safe and 
feasible process. More importantly, EM may also improve 
functional recovery, reduce the ICU length of stay, 
decrease readmissions to the ICU and even improve 
survival [12-16]. Yet limited systematic attention and 
analysis has so far been applied to the understanding and 
assessment of EM [17]. In this article we aim to defi ne the 
concept of EM in comparison with traditional physical 
therapy, to review the evidence for its feasibility, safety 
and possible effi cacy, and to defi ne the research agenda 
for its more comprehensive assessment.
Traditional physical therapy
Th ere are international guidelines on the traditional 
approach to physical therapy for patients in the ICU. 
Th ey include the application of a passive range of 
movements and the encouragement of an active range of 
movements early in the ICU stay [18]. Attempts at full 
active mobilization are often reserved until after the 
acute phase of the illness has resolved. In particular, it is 
recognized that rehabilitation may not commence until 
after ICU discharge, as the patients are viewed as too sick 
to participate whilst receiving mechanical ventilation. 
Th ese traditional practices are not based on high-quality 
evidence and are simply derived from expert opinion. 
Despite such opinions, however, practice and attitudes 
surrounding physical therapy and mobilization in the 
Abstract
Early mobilization (EM) of ICU patients is a 
physiologically logical intervention to attenuate critical 
illness-associated muscle weakness. However, its 
long-term value remains controversial. We performed 
a detailed analytical review of the literature using 
multiple relevant key terms in order to provide a 
comprehensive assessment of current knowledge 
on EM in critically ill patients. We found that the term 
EM remains undefi ned and encompasses a range of 
heterogeneous interventions that have been used 
alone or in combination. Nonetheless, several studies 
suggest that diff erent forms of EM may be both safe 
and feasible in ICU patients, including those receiving 
mechanical ventilation. Unfortunately, these studies 
of EM are mostly single center in design, have limited 
external validity and have highly variable control 
treatments. In addition, new technology to facilitate 
EM such as cycle ergometry, transcutaneous electrical 
muscle stimulation and video therapy are increasingly 
being used to achieve such EM despite limited 
evidence of effi cacy. We conclude that although 
preliminary low-level evidence suggests that EM in the 
ICU is safe, feasible and may yield clinical benefi ts, EM 
is also labor-intensive and requires appropriate staffi ng 
models and equipment. More research is thus required 
to identify current standard practice, optimal EM 
techniques and appropriate outcome measures before 
EM can be introduced into the routine care of critically 
ill patients.

ICU show wide variability worldwide [19], and even 
within the same country [20].
Th e evidence to support the use of passive movements 
as part of a program of early mobilization is weak [16]. 
Such evidence suggests that passive movements may 
prevent protein degradation, maintain muscle mass and 
alter the infl ammatory profi le in humans [21,22]. For 
example, in 20 subjects with severe sepsis or septic shock 
randomized to 30  minutes of predominantly passive 
exercise or no intervention, the passive exercise group 
preserved fat-free mass, decreased IL-6 and increased 
IL-10 levels compared with control patients who lost 
7.2% of fat free mass in the fi rst 7  days following 
admission to the ICU [23]. Clearly this level of evidence 
is minimal and requires further investigation. Clinical 
observation, however, suggests that more than simple 
passive move ment should be done in order to help 
preserve muscle strength. EM might represent a better 
approach than traditional delayed passive movements. 
Before such an intervention can be advocated, however, it 
needs to be defi ned.
What is early mobilization?
EM is the intensifi cation and early application (within the 
fi rst 2 to 5 days of critical illness) of the physical therapy 
that is administered to critically ill patients (Table 2). EM 
may also include additional specifi c mobilization-enhan￾cing interventions such as active mobilization of patients 
requiring mechanical ventilation and the use of novel 
techniques such as cycle ergometry and transcutaneous 
electrical muscle stimulation (TEMS). In the ICU, EM is 
applied with the intention of maintaining or restoring 
musculoskeletal strength and function, thereby poten￾tially improving functional, patient-centered out comes. A 
major limitation in the ability to determine the outcomes 
following EM is the variety of diff erent techniques 
employed, and the lack of standardization and defi nition 
of them across studies (Table 2).
Two randomized, controlled, clinical trials [12,24] and 
several observational studies [4,25-31] provide data on 
the feasibility and safety of EM as well as preliminary 
data on its effi cacy in patients dependent on ventilatory 
support (Table 2). For instance, in an observational study, 
Bailey and colleagues described 1,449 EM interventions 
in 103 patients [25]. Overall, 53% of these interventions 
included ambulating patients that were dependent on 
positive pressure ventilation via an endotracheal tube or 
tracheostomy. Only 1% of these EM activities were asso￾ciated with an adverse event. Th ese events included fi ve 
episodes of the patient falling to their knees without 
injury, three episodes of hypotension to a systolic blood 
pressure <90  mmHg, one case of increase in systolic 
blood pressure to >200 mmHg, three episodes of oxygen 
saturation decreases to <80% and the removal of one 
enteral feeding tube. Th is type of EM treatment was 
resourced from within the existing ICU staff structure, 
including ICU nurses, technicians, physical therapists 
and respira tory therapists.
In a further study, the same group described a before￾and-after cohort study in 104 patients with respiratory 
failure who were transferred from another ICU to their 
respiratory ICU [28]. Transfer to the EM-based respira￾tory ICU increased the probability of ambulation 
(P <0.0001) during the patient’s ICU stay. By multivariate 
logistic regression analysis, independent predictors of 
increased ambulation were transfer to the respiratory 
ICU with a commitment to EM, female gender, absence 
of sedatives and lower Acute Physiology and Chronic 
Health Evaluation II scores. Eighty-eight percent of 
patients survived to hospital discharge with a mean 
ambulated distance in the ICU of 200 feet.
In addition to the above work, Schweickert and 
colleagues completed a prospective, outcome assessor￾blinded, randomized trial of EM and occupational 
therapy in two centers in the USA [12]. In this study, 
patients who were mechanically ventilated for <72 hours 
and expected to stay ventilated in the next 24 hours were 
randomized either to an EM protocol (rapid progression 
from passive range of movements to active range of 
move ments, to bed mobility, to sitting balance, to stand￾ing, to standing transfers and gait re-education during 
sedation interruption) or to a control group, which 
underwent physical and occupational therapy as pres￾cribed by standard care, typically only after extubation. 
Th is trial found that EM was safe and feasible and that it 
was associated with improved functional outcomes as 
measured using the Katz Index [32] and independent 
walking at hospital discharge. Importantly, patients in the 
EM intervention group started physical therapy earlier 
(1.5 days vs. 7.3 days, P = 0.0001) and were signifi cantly 
more likely to return to functional independence (defi ned 
as being able to wash, dress, groom, eat, transfer from bed 
to chair and walk independently) at hospital dis charge 
(59% vs. 35%, P  =  0.02). Th is study diff ered from other 
trials because patients were mobilized very early (day 1.5 
on average) and the results documented func tional 
outcomes in a blinded manner. Major adverse events were 
rare (one in 498 EM-related events, with no extubations, 
falls or change in systolic blood pressure and one episode

of decreased oxygen saturation <80%). How ever, in order 
to maximize the degree of mobilization, new techniques 
are rapidly emerging that can be more easily and perhaps 
more safely applied to ventilated supine patients.
Early mobilization using novel techniques
Cycle ergometer
A cycle ergometer is a stationary cycle with an automatic 
mechanism that can alter the amount of work performed 
by the patient. Th e cycle can be used passively (no work 
from the patient) or actively (Figure 1). Cycle ergometry 
has been tested in healthy subjects as part of the space 
research program and has been found to preserve thigh 
muscle thickness during prolonged immobilization [33]. 
Th e method has also been shown to be safe and feasible 
in studies during hemodialysis [34] and in patients with 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [35].
Cycle ergometer-based mobilization in addition to 
standard care has now been used as a form of EM in a 
single-center randomized trial of 90 critically ill patients, 
and compared with standard care alone. In this study, 
cycle ergometer-based mobilization improved the median 
6-minute walk distance at hospital discharge (196 m vs. 
143  m, P  <0.05) [24]. In addition, the mobilization 
method was reported to be safe and feasible, with a 
median of four cycle sessions completed per week and 
the time taken from ergometer set-up to clean-up inclu￾sive reported at 30 to 40  minutes. Th ere were no major 
adverse events and only 4% of cycle sessions were stopped 
early due to adverse changes in oxygen saturation <90%.

strength in patients with chronic heart failure [36,37] and

in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
[38]. In a recent systematic review, TEMS was found to 
improve muscle strength, exercise capacity and disease￾specifi c health status [39]. TEMS is of particular interest 
in the ICU setting because the loss of muscle mass is 
rapid and more severe than in other chronic conditions 
[40]. In addition, the TEMS technique can be used easily 
in immobile sedated patients.
Despite the physiological attractiveness and promise of 
TEMS, the randomized controlled trials that have 
evaluated the eff ects of EM by means of TEMS initiated 
in the fi rst 7 days of ICU stay have reported confl icting 
results [41-45]. Diff erences in patient selection, the 
inclusion or exclusion of patients with sepsis, the appli￾cation of TEMS to heterogeneous populations, and 
variable study methodology have all probably contributed 
to discrepancies in reported outcomes.
Th e largest study of TEMS to date investigated 140 
critically ill patients and randomly assigned them to 
TEMS or standard care [44]. TEMS was conducted daily 
for 55 minutes to the lower limb (vastus lateralis, vastus 
medialis and peroneous longus muscles). Th e primary 
outcome was ICU-acquired (neuromuscular) weakness 
diagnosed using the Medical Research Council score 
(<48/60) by two unblinded independent investigators. 
Th e Medical Research Council score was signifi cantly 
higher in patients in the TEMS group compared with 
those of the control group (58 (33 to 60) vs. 52 (2 to 60)). 
However, this study has been criticized for several 
reasons [46]. First, measure ment of the primary outcome 
could only be performed in awake, cooperative patients. 
Th is limitation excluded 39 patients who died and 44 
patients who were cognitively impaired from the fi nal 
analysis. Accordingly, the intention-to-treat principle 
was violated. In the intervention group, data from three 
patients were also excluded due to the use of 
neuromuscular blockers. Finally, TEMS was applied only 
to the lower limb but the Medical Research Council score 
refl ects upper and lower limb strength. Although it is 
theoretically possible that TEMS has systemic eff ects, the 
change in upper limb strength seems unusual [41]. Th ere 
was no report of patient tolerance to TEMS. Future 
studies should include a report of patient discomfort with 
the use of this technique.
Other small randomized controlled trials (n <25 subjects) 
have evaluated the eff ects of TEMS in patients who were 
chronically critically ill and requiring mechanical 
ventilation for >14 days. Such trials have reported 
improvements in muscle mass as measured by ultrasound 
[47], muscle strength as assessed using manual muscle 
testing (2.2 ± 1.0 vs. 1.3 ± 0.8, P = 0.02) and function as 
measured by changes in the number of days required to 
transfer from bed to chair (11 ± 2 days vs. 14 ± 2 days, 
P  = 0.001) [48]. In this regard, the results of the small 
study (n = 24) by Zanotti and colleagues are of particular 
interest because improvements in muscle strength were 
accompanied by improved function [48]. Th e inter￾vention protocol, however, included the use of TEMS in 
conjunction with a program of active limb exercise in 
ventilator-dependent patients with chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease. Th eir results therefore suggest that 
TEMS may act synergistically with active exercise and 
thus should not be used in isolation but should rather be 
a useful component of a wider-ranging EM protocol 
aimed at restoring muscle mass in chronically critically ill 
patients. Th ere was no report of patient tolerance to 
TEMS.
Despite the above reports, the assessment of effi cacy in 
small trials remains diffi cult and investigators are 
increasingly focusing on surrogate outcomes that would 
justify the conduct of larger phase II studies. Among such 
outcomes, muscle layer thickness and muscle cross￾sectional area measured by ultrasound appear to have a 
relationship with muscle strength [49,50]. Further 
research is required to establish whether these outcomes 
are associated with sustained improvement in function 
and health-related quality of life and can be reliably used 
as surrogates for such clinical outcomes.
Custom-made technological aids
Ambulation is a specifi c EM technique that is used in the 
ICU to improve functional recovery [25,27,29]. Standard 
hospital equipment may generally be adequate. When 
ambulating a mechanically ventilated patient, however, 
the standard equipment may not maximize safety and 
eff ectiveness [40]. For example, some hospitals have had 
their own engineers design a custom-made walker for 
ventilated patients that incorporates a walking frame on 
wheels, an intravenous pole, an oxygen basket and a 
platform to support a ventilator, all in a single device 
(Figure 2). Th is type of equipment may improve the safety 
of the patient as the nurse and physical therapist have

their hands free of equipment and are able to concentrate 
on the patient’s gait, balance and physiological response 
to exercise, such as their respiratory rate. Th ere is no 
evidence that patients require electrocardiogram moni￾tor ing during early mobilization.
Video therapies
Among other descriptive papers of novel techniques for 
EM in the ICU, the feasibility of Wii and other interactive 
video therapies has been described. In an observational, 
single-center study, Kho and colleagues investigated the 
use of video therapies as a form of EM in critical illness 
[51]. Of 410 patients receiving physical therapy, 5% used 
video games for balance (52%) and endurance (45%). Th e 
most common games were boxing, bowling and balance 
board. No adverse events occurred (95% upper confi -
dence limit for safety event rate: 8.4%). No trials, however, 
have compared such interventions with a control group 
receiving standard care.
Barriers to early mobilization
Although EM seems intuitively useful and physiologically 
logical it can in fact be a complex and eff ort-intensive 
therapy, which is made even more challenging by the 
presence of multiple barriers that impede its wider 
uptake [30]. Such barriers include inadequate staff to 
deliver physical therapy, lack of equipment, concern 
regarding patient safety and physiological stability [31], 
sedation and ventilation practices, placement of vascular 
lines, and the paucity of data on effi cacy and health￾economic evaluation to convince clinicians to apply EM 
[14].
A key barrier to the delivery of EM is concern about 
the safety of the patient [14]. Adverse events may include 
the dislodgement of vascular lines, nasogastric tubes and 
urinary catheters and, much more importantly, of an 
artifi cial airway, leading to life-threatening hypoxia. To 
counter these concerns, however, there is an emerging 
body of data suggesting that EM does not impose an 
increased risk to patients if it is performed with 
appropriately trained staff [4,12,24,25,27,28,30]. In 
several studies conducted in US centers, EM involved a 
mobilization team of three ICU clinicians, including a 
physical therapist, a nurse and an occupational therapist 
or an assistant [25,27,28]. In addition, patients were 
carefully evaluated holistically prior to undertaking EM 
with a comprehensive assessment of age, level of fi tness 
prior to ICU admission, presenting condition, tolerance 
of other interventions and the amount of ventilatory and 
cardiac support required prior to EM.
EM is feasible only if the patient is awake and co￾operative [52] and therefore the use of sedation needs to 
be minimized to facilitate EM [53]. Th e importance of 
interactions between the degree of sedation and the 
ability to apply EM has been highlighted in several 
publications [30,53]. Other key factors that appear to be 
associated with successful EM include adequate pain 
management and early recognition and management of 
delirium [13,54-56].
An additional consideration is the availability of 
suffi cient staff and equipment to facilitate EM. Physical 
therapists should be an integral part of the inter￾disciplinary team in the ICU involved in the imple men￾tation of EM. Having at least one ICU nurse available is 
also important (Figure  3). In the USA, a respiratory 
therapist would also be included to disconnect the 
ventilator and assist with a portable ventilator [15]. Th e 
need for such complex multiskilled personnel with 
suffi cient training in EM and the need for appropriate 
equipment may be the major barrier to the imple￾mentation of EM in most ICUs worldwide.
Early mobilization research agenda
International diff erences in staff availability result in 
heterogeneous research questions in relation to EM in 
diff erent countries. In American studies, for example, 
research has concentrated on providing information to 
justify appropriate resources for physical therapy input in 
ICUs [4]. In contrast, in Europe and Australia physical 
therapy is generally considered part of standard manage￾ment. Two national surveys, however, have reported a 
striking degree of variability between institutions within 
the same country in terms of referral to physical therapy 
during critical illness, staff ratios and frequency of such 
therapy [19,20]. Th is variability in practice underscores 
the importance of carefully defi ning and understanding 
usual care prior to undertaking any interventional studies 
Figure 2. Custom-made walker for ventilated patients. The walker 
incorporates a walking frame on wheels, intravenous pole, oxygen 
basket and platform to support a ventilator, all in a single device.

to evaluate the effi cacy and safety of EM in diff erent 
jurisdictions. Th e variability also highlights the limited 
external validity of single-center studies.
Key research questions
Standard mobilization practice in ICUs nationally and 
internationally remains poorly defi ned. Until standard 
mobilization is clearly defi ned and measured in multi￾center studies it is impossible to conduct studies of any 
EM interventions that are relevant to modern ICU 
treatment, have external validity, and provide suffi cient 
treatment separation. Th ere may be limitations to 
establishing a true, ethical control group to establish the 
eff ect of EM, especially in those countries where 
physiotherapy practice already includes elements of EM. 
Th e typical functional outcomes of candidate patients 
who survive and are treated with standard care also need 
to be defi ned. Once baseline practice and functional out￾comes are established in multicenter prospective cohort 
studies, then multicenter pilot studies of a candidate EM 
intervention can be tested for separation and contami￾nation. In addition, several potential relevant outcomes 
(muscle thickness, muscle strength for diff er ent muscle 
groups, functional independence) must also be assessed 
as outcome measures for EM interventions and their 
relationships with each other understood in order to 
power future larger studies of these interventions.
Conclusion
ICU survivors recovering from a prolonged illness often 
have muscle weakness and major functional impairment. 
Early mobilization is a physiologically logical candidate 
intervention to attenuate such weakness. Observational 
studies and initial small randomized trials evaluating EM 
suggest safety and feasibility. Th ese studies also suggest 
that EM has the potential to improve functional 
outcomes in survivors. Unfortunately, such studies are 
mostly single center in design and carry limited external 
validity. Further trials to investigate the potential benefi ts 
of EM and the best techniques to maximize its effi cacy 
are warranted but require careful consideration of 
standard practice, optimal treatment strategies and 
outcome measures.
