Abstract
An increasing number of studies have reported a heritable component for the regulation of energy intake and eating behaviour, although
the individual polymorphisms and their ‘effect size’ are not fully elucidated. The aim of the present study was to examine the relationship
between specific SNP and appetite responses and energy intake in overweight men. In a randomised cross-over trial, forty overweight men
(age 32 (SD 09) years; BMI 27 (SD 2) kg/m2
) attended four sessions 1 week apart and received three isoenergetic and isovolumetric servings
of dairy snacks or water (control) in random order. Appetite ratings were determined using visual analogue scales and energy intake at an
ad libitum lunch was assessed 90 min after the dairy snacks. Individuals were genotyped for SNP in the fat mass and obesity-associated
(FTO), leptin (LEP), leptin receptor (LEPR) genes and a variant near the melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) locus. The postprandial fullness
rating over the full experiment following intake of the different snacks was 17·2 % (P¼0·026) lower in A carriers compared with TT homo￾zygotes for rs9939609 (FTO, dominant) and 18·6 % (P¼0·020) lower in G carriers compared with AA homozygotes for rs7799039
(LEP, dominant). These observations indicate that FTO and LEP polymorphisms are related to the variation in the feeling of fullness
and may play a role in the regulation of food intake. Further studies are required to confirm these initial observations and investigate
the ‘penetrance’ of these genotypes in additional population subgroups.
Key words: Appetite: Genotype: Fat mass and obesity-associated gene: Leptin: Leptin receptor: Melanocortin-4 receptor
Although obesity is generally associated with lifestyle factors,
degree of adiposity is thought to have a significant heritable
component(1). SNP in several genes encoding for proteins
involved in the hypothalamic control of food intake, energy
balance and consequently management of body weight(2)
have been associated with common (non-Mendelian)
obesity(3). The fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO), melano￾cortin-4 receptor (MC4R), leptin (LEP) and leptin receptor
(LEPR) genes regulate food intake and energy homeostasis(4)
through their actions on the leptin–melanocortin pathway in
the hypothalamus(5), and variants in these loci regions have
been identified as genetic risk factors for common obesity.
Genetic variation in FTO was the first common SNP related
to BMI, with AA homozygotes for a SNP (rs9939609) in the first
intron of the FTO gene having a 1·7-fold increased risk of
obesity compared with TT individuals(6). Consistent associ￾ations between identified SNP located 188 kb near MC4R
and obesity have been found in genome-wide association
studies(7). Each copy of the rs17782313 C allele in the MC4R
gene was associated with a 0·2 kg/m2 increase in BMI. Further￾more, although genetic variation in the LEP gene and that of
its receptor LEPR was not identified to be associated with
obesity-related traits in genome-wide association studies, a
link to obesity has been reported in several candidate gene
studies(8–11).
However, the physiological basis for these genotype–
adiposity associations is poorly understood. Given the fact
that obesity is a disorder of energy imbalance between energy
intake and expenditure, several studies have demonstrated
that the SNP (rs9939609) in the FTO gene contributed to vari￾ations in energy intake(12–17). Yet, most of the studies showing
a greater energy intake in individuals carrying the risk allele
were conducted in children. In addition, it has been proposed
that particular genetic polymorphism in the MC4R, LEP and
LEPR genes influences obesity by affecting eating patterns,
snacking(18,19) and energy intake(20). However, there is a pau￾city of evidence on whether they affect appetite responses
(hunger, desire to eat and prospective food consumption)

including satiety (the feeling of fullness that influences the time
interval between meals). The aim of the present study was to
assess the effect of SNP in the FTO, LEP, LEPR and MC4R
genes on postprandial appetite responses and ad libitum
energy intake from a lunchtime meal in overweight men. The
present analysis was conducted using data from a previously
published acute appetite study, the primary aim of which was
to examine the effect of consumption of individual dairy pro￾ducts as snacks on appetite(21).
Subjects and methods
Study population
A total of forty healthy, non-smoking overweight men, aged
18–50 years with a BMI of 25·0–29·9 kg/m2
, were recruited
from the local Reading area. Subjects were excluded if they:
had food allergies or irregular eating patterns; were athletes
who trained .10 h/week; were cognitively dietary restrained
eaters (Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire(22), factor 1 . 11),
non-breakfast consumers or non-snack consumers; had any
dislike of the ‘study’ foods or had blood pressure and bio￾chemical measurements outside the ‘normal’ range (blood
pressure .160/100 mmHg, and plasma total cholesterol
.8·0 mmol/l, glucose ,5 or .7 mmol/l, TAG .1·8 mmol/l,
alanine transaminase .45 U/l (0.75 mkat/l) or g-glutamyltrans￾ferase .55 U/l (0.92 mkat/l)) after a 12 h overnight fast. The
study was conducted according to the guidelines laid down in
the Declaration of Helsinki, and all procedures involving
human subjects were approved by the University of Reading
Research and Ethics Committee. Subjects gave written informed
consent before commencing the study.
Postprandial study design
A randomised within-subject experimental design was per￾formed, with each subject returning for four separate test ses￾sions in the Hugh Sinclair Nutrition Unit at least 1 week apart.
After a 12 h overnight fast, appetite profile was assessed (base￾line) using a visual analogue scale rating of hunger (how
hungry do you feel?), desire to eat (how strong is your
desire to eat?), fullness (how full do you feel?) and prospective
food consumption (how much do you think you could eat
right now?) anchored by the terms ‘not at all’ and ‘extremely’.
These four questions were also reflected in an average
appetite score, which was calculated at each time point
for each treatment as appetite (mm) ¼ (desire to eat þ
hunger þ (100 2 fullness) þ prospective consumption)/4(23).
A standardised light breakfast was provided at 09·00 h
(0 min) and appetite was assessed at 10, 60, 115, 125, 145,
165, 185, 205 and 230 min. The light breakfast consisted of
two oat cereal bars with strawberry filling (Nutrigrain soft
baked bars; Kellogg’s) and orange juice (250 ml; Sainsbury’s),
which together had an energy content of 1456 kJ and provided
60·5 g carbohydrate, 3 g protein and 7 g fat. The breakfast pro￾vided 15 % of the energy intake of an average UK male(24). The
dairy snacks were semi-skimmed milk (Cravendale; Arla￾Foods), a natural set biopot yogurt (Dr Oetker) or a mild
Cheddar cheese (Sainsbury’s), and provided the same
energy (841 kJ) and volume (410 ml). Full details of the macro￾nutrient composition of the dairy snacks have been previously
reported(21). Briefly, dairy composition was as follows: milk
(28, 41 and 31 % of energy from protein, carbohydrate and
fat, respectively); yogurt (22, 32 and 46 % of energy from pro￾tein, carbohydrate and fat, respectively); cheese (25 and 75 %
of energy from protein and fat, respectively). The fourth treat￾ment was an isovolumetric serving (compared with milk) of
non-carbonated water. Non-carbonated water was ingested
separately with cheese and yogurt in order to equate the
volume of milk. Energy intake was assessed by an ad libitum
lunch provided 90 min after the dairy snacks or water control.
The lunch consisted of one main course composed of pasta,
tomato and basil sauce and Parmesan cheese (2811·9 kJ/
476·5 g of serving portion). Subjects were instructed to eat
only until they felt comfortably satisfied and were given
20 min to consume the meal. Subjects ate individually in the
dining room of the Unit for the entire length of time, and
ad libitum food intake was monitored by determining total
food consumed (g) and energy consumed (kJ).
DNA isolation and SNP genotyping
Genomic DNA was isolated from the leucocyte buffy coat
layer, which was taken at screening, using the QIAamp DNA
Mini Kit (Qiagen Limited). Genotyping was performed on
four SNP (rs9939609 (FTO) in chromosome 16q12.2,
rs7799039 (LEP) in 7q31.3, rs1137101 (LEPR) in 1p31 and
rs17782313 (MC4R) in 18q21) by conducting allelic discrimi￾nation using a TaqMan Genotyping ‘Assay-on-Demand’
(Applied Biosystems). The percentage of replicate quality￾control samples used for genotyping was 8 % with a .99 %
concordance rate. The call rate was higher than 99·5 % and
the genotype distribution obeyed Hardy–Weinberg equili￾brium (P.0·05).
Statistical analyses
The agreement of allele frequency with Hardy–Weinberg
equilibrium was assessed for all SNP using a x2 analysis.
The genetic model of inheritance was based on the number
of copies of an allele needed for increased susceptibility and
was described as follows: (1) additive, the susceptibility is
increased having 0, 1 and 2 copies of the risk allele with the
risk of 0 alleles ,1 allele ,2 alleles; (2) recessive, 2 copies
of the risk allele are needed; (3) dominant, 1 or 2 copies of
the risk allele are equally related to the likelihood of posses￾sing a trait. The model of inheritance for each SNP that fits
the data best was selected when comparisons between the
additive, recessive and dominant models for each SNP were
made. The genotypic effect of the four SNP on the baseline￾adjusted, self-reported appetite scores or energy intake was
evaluated by the PROC MIXED procedure (SAS Institute, Inc.
1992). Random effects of subject and subject £ time inter￾actions and fixed effects of treatment (dairy snacks or
water), visit and SNP on appetite score and energy intake
were tested and adjusted for BMI and age. The first-order

autoregressive (AR (1)) covariance structure was selected for the
appetite scores and variance components were selected for the
energy intake based on goodness-of-fit criteria. The number of
subjects was insufficient to test SNP interactions for the appetite
scores and energy intake. Further backward stepwise analysis
was conducted by checking the significance of the fixed effects
or their interactions and including in the models only the signifi￾cant effects. All models were tested for the normality of
residuals. Standard diagnostics were used to ensure that all vari￾ables meet the normal distribution assumption. Statistical ana￾lyses were performed using SAS (release 9.2; SAS Institute,
Inc.). Differences were considered statistically significant at
P,0·05 (two-tailed). Data are presented as means with their
standard errors, unless otherwise indicated.
Results
All forty men completed the study. The mean age and BMI of
the study participants was 32·1 (SD 9·1) years and 26·8
(SD 1·6) kg/m2
. The mean average appetite rating of 51·9
(SD 24·9) mm (out of a possible 100 mm) and an ad libitum
lunch intake of 3978·7 (SD 1444·0) kJ were evident for the
group as a whole (data not shown). The genotype distribution
of the four examined SNP all obeyed Hardy–Weinberg
equilibrium (P.0·05) and their allele frequencies are provided
in Table 1.
Effect of SNP on responses of hunger, desire to eat,
fullness, prospective food consumption and energy intake
at lunch
Mean postprandial responses of appetite according to SNP
using backward stepwise analyses are presented in Table 2.
There was no detectable difference between the genotype
groups for the LEPR or MC4R SNP with respect to postprandial
appetite responses. The mean ratings of hunger and desire to
eat over the full experiment following intake of the different
snacks were 23·9 % (P¼0·019) and 21·8 % (P¼0·046) higher
in A carriers compared with TT homozygotes for FTO (domi￾nant model), respectively. The fullness score was 17·2 %
(P¼0·026) lower in A carriers compared with TT homozygotes
for FTO (dominant model) and 18·6 % (P¼0·020) lower in G
carriers compared with AA homozygotes for LEP (dominant
model). The most notable effect was a genotype difference
in prospective food consumption, with A and G carriers
displaying 26·0 % (P¼0·008) and 19·1 % (P¼0·028) higher
prospective food consumption compared with TT individuals
in FTO and AA individuals in LEP, respectively. The average
appetite, as a summary measure of the four specific appetite
responses, was 11·0 (SE 4·5) mm (P¼0·015) higher in A carriers
compared with TT homozygotes for FTO (dominant model)
and 8·0 (SE 4·2) mm lower in G carriers compared with AA
homozygotes for LEP (dominant model) without reaching
significance (P¼0·057). The four individual SNP did not
have an effect on ad libitum energy intake at lunch (Table 2).
Similar results on the phenotypes were observed in the
backward stepwise analysis by checking the significance of
the fixed effects or their interactions and including in the
models only the significant effects (data not shown).
Discussion
A heritable component for the regulation of appetite and
eating behaviour has been reported, although the individual
polymorphisms, their ‘effect size’ and the molecular mechan￾isms underlying genotype–phenotype associations are not
fully elucidated(4). The present study investigated for the first
time the effect of FTO, LEP, LEPR and MC4R variants on
measurements of appetite and energy intake at an ad libitum
lunch, in a ‘fit for purpose’ appetite research laboratory set￾ting. The main finding was that primarily a FTO and to a
lesser extent LEP polymorphisms were associated with an
overall reduced appetite (based on the four phenotypes)
and more specifically with perceptions of fullness and
prospective food consumption.
While numerous studies, largely conducted in children,
have examined the effect of the FTO rs9939609 SNP on food
intake, dietary energy density and macronutrient selec￾tion(12,14,25), very few have examined its impact on appe￾tite(16,26). Wardle et al.(16) showed that children homozygous
for the purported risk allele (AA) had reduced satiety scores,
and these results have recently been replicated in adults
by den Hoed et al.(26). Carriers of the risk allele (TA/AA)
had increased hunger (OR 3·02, 95 % CI 1·26, 7·24) and
decreased satiety (OR 2·02, 95 % CI 1·26, 7·24) relative to TT
homozygotes(26). This is in agreement with the present
results, since TT homozygotes had higher fullness and lower
hunger and prospective food consumption scores compared
with A carriers.

The role of leptin and its receptor in the regulation of
energy homeostasis is well established, with studies demon￾strating that functional mutations in the LEP and LEPR genes
underlie a proportion of severe early-onset obesity
cases(27,28). However, the current epidemic of obesity cannot
be explained by these rare monogenic mutations, and data
in the literature considering the associations between
common polymorphisms in the rs7799039 (LEP) or
rs1137101 (LEPR) genes and polygenic obesity phenotypes
are inconsistent(11,29–31). The present study is one of the few
that have examined the impact of leptin and its receptor
gene variants on appetite responsiveness. Ratings of fullness
and prospective food consumption were found to be different
between the genotype groups for LEP with a significant
increase in feelings of fullness and suppressed prospective
food consumption in AA homozygotes relative to G carriers.
This is in contrast with the two studies by den Hoed
et al.(26,32), in which LEP was not associated with hunger
and satiety(26) and where GG homozygotes felt more hungry
compared with GA, but not AA individuals(32). Additionally,
den Hoed et al.(26) showed that AA individuals had lower
hunger ratings compared with carriers of the risk allele in
LEPR, while in the present study, there was no effect of
LEPR on appetite. It has been proposed that LEPR variants
may affect the transcription of leptin depending on the circu￾lating concentration of leptin(10). However, circulating leptin
concentration is influenced by BMI, body fat mass, sex and
hormonal status(10,33). Thus, this discrepancy among the
studies, although hard to explain, might be due to the rela￾tively small homogeneous sample size in the present study
(overweight men) compared with the larger more hetero￾geneous populations with respect to BMI distribution (from
19 to 31 kg/m2
), sex (both sexes) and body fat mass in the
other two studies.
Both LEP and MC4R genes are involved in the regulation of
appetite and food intake through the leptin–melanocortin
pathway(5). Despite the role of the MC4R in the regulation
of energy intake and its association with obesity(34), there
are controversial results regarding the association between
the rs17782313 (MC4R) variant and intakes of total dietary
energy and fat in human subjects(20,35,36). In most studies, diet￾ary energy intake was assessed using self-reported FFQ, which
are prone to a number of limitations and errors. However,
even with more valid and accurate measurement of intake in
the present study, the MC4R genotype did not emerge as a
significant determinant of ad libitum energy consumption.

There are a limited number of studies examining the impact
of genotype on appetite responsiveness, with no data avail￾able to base valid power calculations. Although the strength
of the present study is the careful phenotypic characterisation
of our volunteers with respect to appetite regulation, a limi￾tation is the relatively small number of subjects, which may
result in limited power to detect more subtle effects of the
minor allele relative to the wild-type genotype.
In conclusion, the present preliminary investigations have
shown that FTO and LEP polymorphisms are related to a feel￾ing of fullness and decreased prospective food consumption.
Further research is warranted to validate these novel findings,
to investigate the interactions between individual gene var￾iants and the interactions between variants and dietary nutri￾ents, to identify the best-fitting model of inheritance, to
provide an insight into the underlying physiological mechan￾isms for the genotype–phenotype associations and to investi￾gate the ‘penetrance’ of these genotypes in additional
population subgroups.
