Abstract
Background: An accident or a catastrophic disease may occasionally lead to brain death (BD) during pregnancy.
Management of brain-dead pregnant patients needs to follow special strategies to support the mother in a way
that she can deliver a viable and healthy child and, whenever possible, also be an organ donor. This review
discusses the management of brain-dead mothers and gives an overview of recommendations concerning the
organ supporting therapy.
Methods: To obtain information on brain-dead pregnant women, we performed a systematic review of Medline,
EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). The collected data included the age of
the mother, the cause of brain death, maternal medical complications, gestational age at BD, duration of extended
life support, gestational age at delivery, indication of delivery, neonatal outcome, organ donation of the mothers
and patient and graft outcome.
Results: In our search of the literature, we found 30 cases reported between1982 and 2010. A nontraumatic brain
injury was the cause of BD in 26 of 30 mothers. The maternal mean age at the time of BD was 26.5 years. The
mean gestational age at the time of BD and the mean gestational age at delivery were 22 and 29.5 weeks,
respectively. Twelve viable infants were born and survived the neonatal period.
Conclusion: The management of a brain-dead pregnant woman requires a multidisciplinary team which should
follow available standards, guidelines and recommendations both for a nontraumatic therapy of the fetus and for
an organ-preserving treatment of the potential donor.
Background
Brain death (BD) as “coma dépassé“ was first defined by
Mollaret and Goulon in 1959 [1], and it remains the
medically and legally accepted framework for the diag￾nosis of death. Death is pronounced on the basis of
well-defined clinical examinations followed by confirma￾tory technical tests. Recent improvements in life support
technology and critical care management make it possi￾ble to maintain the patient’s vital functions after BD.
The question whether to offer life support to brain-dead
patients and how long it should be provided has become
a controversial ethical issue. The issue is still more
complex when BD occurs during pregnancy. Of course,
the incidence of BD in pregnant women is very low and
there are only few case reports. As shown by Suddaby
et al. [2], of 252 brain-dead patients, only 5 (2.8%) cases
involved pregnant women between 15 and 45 years
of age.
When confronted with BD in a pregnant woman, phy￾sicians must primarily focus on saving the life of the
fetus, and therefore the treatment protocol should give
special recommendations on how to support the mother
in a way that she can deliver a viable and healthy child.
After delivery, brain-dead pregnant women may also be
candidates for organ donation. Therefore, two aspects
must be considered in case of maternal BD: supporting
the fetus until successful delivery and, if possible, sup￾porting the brain-dead mother as an organ donor.

Hence, if the mother and the fetus are regarded as two
distinct organisms, maintaining the vital functions of a
brain-dead pregnant patient may be ethically justifiable
to support both the birth of a child and possible organ
donation. In such a situation, various clinical disciplines
such as neurosurgery, intensive care medicine, obste￾trics, neonatology, anesthesiology, transplantation sur￾gery and an ethics committee should work together to
minimize maternal and fetal morbidity as well as
mortality.
Since only a few reported cases are to be found in the
medical literature, most approaches to managing a
brain-dead mother remain experiential and relatively lit￾tle publicized. In this article, we review the available
cases of prolonged somatic support in brain-dead preg￾nant women and analyze when and under which cir￾cumstances the pregnancy should be maintained and
what challenges are to be faced. To present a protocol
to support such patients, we discuss the management of
the brain-dead mother and fetus, related recommenda￾tions and legal and ethical issues.
Methods
Search strategy
We performed a systematic review of Medline (1975-
2010), EMBASE (1982-2010) and the Cochrane Central
Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The
Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2010) for relevant citations.
Key words used in electronic searching included “mater￾nal brain death,” “pregnancy,” “brain death,” “manage￾ment of brain death” and “fetal monitoring.” Reference
lists of retrieved relevant articles were screened for
other studies. Additionally, to include all existent stu￾dies, we also contacted experts in the related fields of
brain death and pregnancy.
Study selection and data extraction
All studies which reported at least one case of maternal
brain death during pregnancy were eligible for inclusion.
We excluded studies dealing with pregnancy in a persis￾tent vegetative state because brain death adds complex￾ities to pregnancy that are very different from a
persistent vegetative state, calling for different medical
management and obstetric strategies, as well as other
legal and ethical considerations. Furthermore, we
excluded studies which only discussed ethical and legal
issues and studies providing insufficient data. There
were no language restrictions. One reviewer (ME)
screened all titles and abstracts to assess whether they
were potentially eligible for inclusion and whether full
text was required. Then abstracts and full texts for all
potentially eligible studies were reviewed by two
researchers (ME and EK), who independently evaluated
these articles and extracted their data. Any disagreement
during study selection and the data extraction process
was resolved by discussion with a third author (AM).
According to our search of the medical literature, 30
cases of maternal BD (19 case reports and 1 case series)
were reported between 1982 and 2010. The collected
data included the age of the mother, the cause of BD,
maternal medical complications, gestational age at BD,
duration of life support and gestational age at delivery.
In addition, we evaluated the indication of delivery,
mode of delivery, neonatal outcome and organ donation
by the mothers, as well as the transplant outcome. In
our analysis, we particularly focused on the critical care
management of brain-dead mothers such as respiratory
and cardiovascular support, endocrinology and thermo￾regulation, nutritional support and organ donation, as
well as aspects of obstetric management, including fetal
monitoring.
Statistical analysis
The statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 14.0
software for Windows (Stata Corp., College Station, TX,
USA). All statistical data regarding maternal age, dura￾tion of maternal support, gestational age and fetal birth￾weight were expressed as means.
Results
Figure 1 summarizes the process of literature identifica￾tion and selection. According to our search, between
1982 and 2010, 19 case reports and 1 case series were
published. In Table 1, we summarize the 30 reported
cases of extended maternal life support after BD with
pregnancy and the resulting neonatal outcomes.
Maternal and obstetric outcome
In the 30 reported cases, the maternal mean age at the
time of BD was 26.5 years. Only three mothers were in
the high-risk pregnancy category (age <18 or age >35
yr) with respect to their age. Two mothers were 18
years old and a third one was 40 years old at the time
of pregnancy. Trauma was the cause of BD in 4 of 30
mothers, and the other 26 died of nontraumatic brain
injuries. The mean duration of maternal support was
38.3 days (range, 2-107 days). In two cases, children
were delivered on the second day after BD was diag￾nosed. Conversely, in two reports, mothers were sup￾ported for more than 100 days before delivery. The
mean gestational age at the time of BD was 22 weeks
(range, 1-40 wk). In 10 of 19 reported cases, the baby
was delivered later than week 28. The mean gestational
age at delivery was 29.5 weeks (range, 26-33 wk). During
extended life support, patients developed several compli￾cations, including infection, hemodynamic instability,
diabetes insipidus (DI), panhypopituitarism, poikilother￾mia, metabolic instability, acute respiratory distress

syndrome and disseminated intravascular coagulation
(Table 1). The indications for delivery in all reported
cases were maternal or fetal difficulties, including mater￾nal hemodynamic instability (seven cases), fetal distress
(three cases), oligohydramnion (two cases), intrauterine
growth retardation (one case) and abnormal pattern of
the placental structure (one case). In two cases in which
maternal BD began at week 13 of gestational age,
spontaneous abortion occurred at weeks 13 and 19. In
four cases, there was intrauterine death. A cesarean sec￾tion was the mode of delivery in all cases which resulted
in live-born fetuses (Table 1).
Fetal and neonatal outcome
In 12 (63%) of 19 reported cases, the prolonged somatic
support led to the delivery of a viable child. We did not

find any information about the fate of the fetuses in the
published case series. Children who were born included
1 female and 10 male infants. No information regarding
sex was given about one infant. The average birthweight
was 1,384 g (range, 815-2,083 g), and the mean Apgar
score was 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. Con￾genital defects were reported for only one infant, who
was diagnosed with fetal hydantoin syndrome resulting
from previous chronic phenytoin usage by the mother.
Four infants required temporary mechanical ventilation
because of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome or
pneumonia. Fungemia was diagnosed in one infant, and
he was treated with amphotericin B. However, not every
infant was sufficiently followed to determine the long￾term effects of prolonged maternal life support. Postna￾tal follow-up up to 24 months was available only for six
infants. All of them developed normally and apparently
had no problems related to their exceptional intrauter￾ine circumstances (Table 1).
Organ procurement and transplant outcome
In three reported cases after successful delivery, organ
donation from the brain-dead mother was carried out.
In two cases, organ procurement was accomplished after
the intrauterine death of the fetus. In yet another five
cases, organ donation was performed, but no report
about the status of the fetus was provided. In six
patients, consent was given by the patient’s family to
donate heart, lung, liver, pancreas and kidneys. In four
donors, no information was given concerning donated
organs. The 1-year graft survival in the reported cases
was excellent. Only one liver and one pancreas were lost
in two patients owing to their primary nonfunction.
Finally, in all cases, maternal somatic support was ended
either after delivery or after organ donation (Table 1).
Discussion
Clinically, following the onset of BD, it is possible to
sustain a brain-dead mother’s somatic functions over a
longer period. Manifold physiological changes occurring
during pregnancy and brain death, as well as the pro￾longed hospital stay after BD, present enormous chal￾lenges, however, both for the treating clinicians and for
the family. The important question is from which gesta￾tional age onward should the pregnancy be supported?
At present, it seems that there is no clear lower limit to
the gestational age which would restrict the physician’s
efforts to support the brain-dead mother and her fetus.
As reported by Slattery et al. [3], a fetus born before 24
weeks of gestation has a limited chance of survival. At
24, 28 and 32 weeks, a fetus has approximately a 20-
30%, 80% and 98% likelihood of survival with a
40%, 10% and less than 2% chance of suffering from a
severe handicap, respectively. Therefore, depending on
maternal stability and fetal growth, the decision must be
made on an individual basis. According to our findings,
prolonged somatic support can lead to the delivery of a
viable child with satisfactory Apgar score and birth￾weight. Such children can also develop normally without
any problems resulting from their intrauterine condi￾tions. Furthermore, after the delivery, mothers could be
considered as potential organ donors. In Figure 2, we
summarize the recommendations for the critical care
management of brain-dead pregnant women. This
schema is not a definitive guideline, because the techni￾cal support and the experience of the responsible medi￾cal team must also be taken under consideration. Also,
the number of reported cases is too small to define the
rate at which intensive care support of the brain-dead
mother can result in a healthy infant. The percentage of
successful cases cannot be determined, because there
are no reports describing failure of intensive maternal
support from all medical centers. Finally, it cannot be
established whether a relative infrequency of cases such
as those that we found in the published literature
reflects the rarity of the event, perfect success in all
prior situations, reluctance to initiate intensive efforts
required to support the brain-dead patient or simply
publication bias.
However, we maintain that the management of a
brain-dead pregnant woman should follow the existent
standards, guidelines and recommendations both for
nontraumatic therapy for the fetus and organ-preserving
treatment for the donor [4-6]. What follows here is the
summary of these guidelines and recommendations.
Cardiovascular support
In the initial phase of BD, tachycardia was detected in less
than half of the patients [7,8]. However, subsequently the
heart rate slowed in all of these patients as factors such as
hypothermia and subclinical myocardial hypoxia antago￾nized the sympathetic activation occurring during the
initial phase of BD [7]. Hypertension in this situation is a
rare, usually self-limiting event. In prolonged hypertension,
short-acting substances such as urapidil or nitroprusside
were applied [9,10]. Typically, at some point, BD patients
also develop hypotension [9]. The initial treatment for
hypotension consists of aggressive fluid replacement, which
is usually done with crystalloids such as lactated Ringer’s
solution in normal (0.9%) or half-normal (0.45%) saline
solutions. Recent studies suggest that to keep intravascular
volume and colloid oncotic pressure within physiological
ranges [9], hydroxyethyl starch can also be applied in case
of a negative effect on the renal graft function [11]. How￾ever, it must be kept in mind that low oncotic pressure and
hypoalbuminemia can cause pulmonary edema [12,13].
Field et al. [14] recommended that in case of pulmonary
edema a Swan-Ganz catheter be used to differentiate

cardiogenic pulmonary edema from acute respiratory dis￾tress syndrome (ARDS) and to guide fluid management. In
addition, extensive hemodynamic monitoring such as Puls￾contour Continuous Cardiac Output (PiCCO™) should be
considered [4,15]. Fluid-resistant hypotension can be trea￾ted using continuous intravenous dopamine receptor ago￾nists, which should be titrated until a mean arterial
pressure of 80 to 110 mmHg is reached [16].
Respiratory support
In maternal BD, special attention needs to be paid to
mechanical ventilation. To facilitate the elimination of
carbon dioxide from the fetus and as a result of the pro￾gesterone effect on the respiratory center, the pregnant
mother develops hypocarbia mediated by an increase in
tidal volume and respiratory rate. Hypocarbia is com￾pensated by an increase in excretion of bicarbonates by
the kidneys [17]. Maternal carbon dioxide tensions, a
tidal volume and respiratory rate should be maintained
in the normal pregnancy range of 28 to 31 mmHg, 6 to
8 mL/kg and 10 to 12/min, respectively [18]. The frac￾tion of inspired oxygen should be kept in a range main￾taining the arterial oxygen saturation above 90%.
Endocrine support
Seventy-eight percent of brain-dead patients who were
kept alive for more than a few days developed central
diabetes insipidus (DI) resulting from posterior pituitary
gland failure [19]. Administration of vasopressin and
aggressive volume replacement should be performed for
the treatment of DI [4]. Howlett et al. [20] reported a
decrease in serum triiodothyronine (T3) in 81% and in
serum thyroxin (T4) in 29% of BD dead organ donors.
Therefore, especially in brain-dead pregnant women T3/
T4 substitution should be adjusted according to labora￾tory examinations. Adrenal insufficiency causes hypoten￾sion and should be treated with methylprednisolone. To
avoid prolonged exposure of the fetus to glucocorticoids
during maternal somatic support, prednisone or methyl￾prednisone should be used, as they do not readily cross
the placenta [21]. Furthermore, since hyperglycemia is
also observed during BD as a result of stress-related per￾ipheral insulin resistance, insulin substitution may be
needed to achieve normoglycemia [12].
Thermoregulation
According to Smith et al. [22], the majority of brain-dead
patients develop hypothermia. It is recommended that the
patient be rewarmed passively using warming blankets or
by warming of fluids. Following infections, brain-dead
patients might also develop hyperthermia. In general, the
inability to maintain body temperature and poikilothermia
(body temperature that is dependent on the environment’s
temperature) accompany brain-dead patients [23,24].
Nutritional support
The nutritional needs of a pregnant woman before and
after BD are not the same. Basal energy expenditure
(BEE) in pregnancy is 655 Kcal + (9.6 × weight (kg) +
[1.8 × height (cm) – 4.7 age (year)]) [25-27]. A weight
gain of 10 to 15 kg accompanies a normal pregnancy
[12]. A brain-dead pregnant woman will expend about
75% of a healthy pregnant woman’s BEE [27]. Nutri￾tional support should be calculated by maternal serum
alimentary values, the weight of the mother and the
growth of the fetus. Owing to reduced motility of the
gastrointestinal tract in brain-dead patients, special
attention should be paid to the management of gastric
reflux. Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) during BD in
pregnant mothers needs to support a positive nitrogen
balance, maternal weight gain, and normal fetal growth
and birthweight [28]. The recommended daily allowance
for protein during pregnancy is 0.8 g kg-1 day-1 (the nor￾mal intake for an average healthy adult) plus an addi￾tional 1.3, 6.1 or 10.7 g kg-1 day-1 for the first, second
or third trimesters, respectively [29,30]. In addition,
20-25% of nonprotein calories should be from fat [29].
Infection
There are three sources of infection which should be
taken into account during prolonged somatic support:
ventilators causing recurrent pneumonia, urinary cathe￾ters resulting in bladder and kidney infections and intra￾vascular catheters as a source of septicemia [31]. The
majority of reported organisms were typical of nosoco￾mial intensive care unit infections such as Staphylococ￾cus aureus, Actinobacter, Pseudomonas, Hemophilus
influenza and fungal pathogens [32,33]. These infections
are usually resistant to antibiotics, and their treatment is
challenging. Maternal infections must be treated aggres￾sively with the most effective substances, rather than
opting for using substances safe for the fetus, which in
turn may not effectively treat the infection [34-36].
Prophylactic anticoagulation
The risk of developing deep vein thrombosis is greater
during pregnancy because of immobility and flaccid
paralysis following BD. Recommended is prophylactic
anticoagulation as it is efficacious for the mother and
safe for the fetus. For venous thromboembolic disease
treatment or prophylaxis during pregnancy, low molecu￾lar weight heparin appears to be as safe and effective as
unfractionated heparin [37].
Obstetric considerations
In maternal BD, it is recommended to screen the mother’s
serum and to examine carefully the fetus by ultrasound to
establish that there are no malformations or pathologic
findings in the fetal development and no chromosomal

abnormalities. In cases with uncertain findings, amniocent￾esis should be discussed with family members, since the
results of these screenings may influence their decisions
[17]. In addition, laboratory tests including complete blood
cell count, electrolytes such as Na+
, Ca2+, K+
, creatinine,
urea, liver enzymes, retinol-binding proteins, albumin, pre￾albumin, transferrin and urine analysis should be
periodically performed. After 24 weeks of gestation, gluco￾corticoids should be administered for fetal lung maturation
and prophylaxis of fetal respiratory distress syndrome
[38,39]. To prevent preterm uterine contractions, in parti￾cular in the early weeks of gestation when no fetal lung
maturation is yet provided, tocolytic interventions may be
needed. Calcium channel blockers and prostaglandin

inhibitors are effective and well tolerated and are therefore
preferred to b-mimetic agents [37,40]. A prolongation of
the pregnancy should continue until at least 26 weeks of
gestation with a possible second application of glucocorti￾coids. If maternal and fetal status remain stable, further
prolongation of the pregnancy until at least 28 weeks of
gestation should be attempted. According to the reported
literature, after 32 weeks of gestation and under glucocorti￾coid-induced fetal lung maturity, no further prolongation
of a pregnancy seems necessary. The optimal method of
delivery in prolonged maternal somatic support is by cesar￾ean section, as it ensures the least traumatic birth for the
fetus. The optimal timing for a cesarean section can be esti￾mated by amniocentesis assessing fetal lung maturity [41].
Fetal and neonatal considerations
The gestational age and the condition of the fetus, above
all lung maturity, are the two most important factors
affecting fetal outcome. The majority of studies reported
routine and complex fetal monitoring such as daily fetal
heart rate monitoring using cardiotocography and nons￾tress testing. Serial ultrasound examinations to evaluate
the fetoplacental unit, including biometric estimations
as well as morphologic studies on the placental structure
and the amnion fluid, should be performed weekly to
assess intrauterine fetal growth [39,42-44].
Organ donation and transplant outcome
After the delivery of the fetus, a brain-dead mother
should be considered as a potential organ donor. Multi￾organ instabilities and extensive critical care therapy
lasting for weeks may have endangered the organs and
caused complications in the recipients. Nevertheless, if
one or more organs are still functioning at the time of
delivery, the feasibility of organ donation in such cata￾strophic cases should not be ignored. As reported by
Suddaby et al. [2] in a retrospective review of 252 brain￾dead potential donors from 1990 to 1996, five of seven
pregnant women functioned as organ donors for 20
transplant recipients. For all of those patients, excellent
patient and graft outcomes were reported.
Ethical and legal issues
Many ethical and legal questions arise in cases of mater￾nal BD. Although it was not the focus of this review, we
briefly discussed various aspects of ethical and legal
issues such as “the mother’s body as a cadaveric incuba￾tor,” “mother as the organ donor and fetus as the recipi￾ent” and the concern for “possible damages to the fetus”
[31,45]. Some professionals believe that it is not ethically
acceptable to maintain the mother’s body after BD to
use it as a “fetal container.” Such a decision should not
be simply assumed, but it must be debated. If the
mother is to be considered a “cadaveric incubator” with
no autonomous rights, the rights of the fetus should leg￾ally prevail. Another argument claims that the prolonged
somatic support itself is actually organ donation with
the fetus as the recipient. In that case, if the mother had
previously indicated a wish to donate her organs, it
would be appropriate to proceed with the extended
somatic support. Finally, some believe that strategies
used to maintain maternal somatic function are still in
the experimental stage. Not every adverse effect of med￾ication used on the fetus during an extended somatic
support is known. The next of kin must therefore be
informed about the existing life maintenance strategies
and the possible damages they may cause to the fetus.
Psychological consultation should certainly be beneficial
in this situation.
Since such catastrophic cases are so infrequent, the
mother’s wish is in effect rarely known. For this reason,
it is strongly suggested to engage the family in the plan￾ning of the care. The physician and transplant coordina￾tor should not impose all available procedures against
the wishes of the family. Sperling et al. [46] suggested
that questions be answered on a case-by-case basis with
the involvement of the hospital’s ethics committee. One
also needs to consider that while nowadays somatic sup￾port in the case of maternal BD is technically possible,
there is still no legal document which asks a pregnant
woman about the fate of her unborn child in the event
of BD. It is highly recommended that this question be
added to the advance directives of any woman of child￾bearing age and routinely discussed in standard prenatal
interviews [47].
Conclusions
At present, BD is a medically and legally accepted event
allowing a pronouncement of death. Taking into
account that in maternal BD two organisms are
involved, the mother and the fetus, a decision whether
to maintain the mother’s vital functions to allow fetal
survival is also an ethical and legal issue. The goal of
prolonged maternal somatic support is to deliver a
viable and healthy infant with a beneficial long-term
outcome. From the medical point of view, the manage￾ment of a brain-dead pregnant woman should follow
the common standards, guidelines and recommenda￾tions for organ-preserving therapy. In some situations,
however, the mother needs special medical support and
interventions which differ from somatic support in non￾pregnant BD patients. Both after a successful delivery
and in the case of fetal abortion, the mother can also be
considered as an organ donor. In general, we recom￾mend that there be no clear lower limit to the gesta￾tional age which would restrict the physician’s efforts to
support the brain-dead mother and her fetus. A meeting

transplant and ethical staff, along with the patient’s
family, should collectively make a decision about future
treatment steps. Since currently there are still only a
limited number of cases describing the management of
extended maternal somatic support after brain death,
the current recommendations should be continuously
reassessed and adapted along with the growing experi￾ence and knowledge. For such serious and rare cases as
described here, it would be advisable from a clinical
point of view to establish an international registry net￾work of BD pregnant patients, which could help to
gather further experience. We also think that from the
practical point of view, it would be possible to establish
such a registry and this network could become a part of
routine clinical usage in all neurosurgery and intensive
care centers.
