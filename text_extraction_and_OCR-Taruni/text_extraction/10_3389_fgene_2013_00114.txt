Screening of the adenosine triphosphate binding cassette transporter protein subfamily
C member 6 gene (ABCC6) in pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) revealed a mutation
detection rate of approximately 87%. Although 25% of the unidentified disease alleles
underlie deletions/insertions, there remain several PXE patients with no clear genotype.The
recent identification of PXE-related diseases and the high intra-familiar and inter-individual
clinical variability of PXE led to the assumption that secondary genetic co-factors exist.
Here, we summarize current knowledge of the genetics underlying PXE and PXE-related
disorders based on human and animal studies. Furthermore, we discuss the role of genetic
interactions and modifier genes in PXE and PXE-related diseases characterized by soft
tissue calcification.

INTRODUCTION
Mutations in ABCC6, a gene encoding for the ABC transporter
protein 6 of subfamily C, formerly known as multidrug resistance￾associated protein 6 (MRP6), are the cause of pseudoxanthoma
elasticum (PXE; Kool et al., 1999; Bergen et al., 2000; Le Saux et al.,
2000; Ringpfeil et al., 2000; Miksch et al., 2005; Schulz et al., 2006).
PXE is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by soft tissue
calcification primarily in the skin, Bruch’s membrane in the retina
and the vessel walls (Neldner and Struk, 2002). To date, more than
300 – mostly unique – PXE-associated ABCC6 mutations have
been identified {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/lovd/home.php?
select_db=ABCC6}. Despite large epidemiological studies includ￾ing more than 500 well-characterized PXE patients, no genotype–
phenotype correlations have been discovered so far. Moreover,
there is a great clinical variability between PXE patients, even
within families with more than one person affected. This hetero￾geneity between patients raised the question of whether factors,
e.g., environmental or genetic background, contribute to PXE
manifestation, disease progression, and severity. The assumption
is supported by the description of PXE-related diseases (Vanakker
et al., 2007) as well as clinical overlaps with other rare mono￾genic syndromes and common cardiovascular disorders (Trip
et al., 2002). A recent publication in this special issue on soft tis￾sue mineralization focused on the clinical phenotype of PXE and
its parallels to other cardiovascular diseases (Lefthériotis et al.,
2013). Here, we summarize the role of ABCC6 mutations as
cause of PXE, and discuss the current knowledge of genetic co￾factors (modifiers) and genetic interactions for PXE and related
disorders.
MUTATIONAL ANALYSIS OF THE ABCC6 GENE
Recently, the PXE candidate gene, ABCC6 (MIM #603234), was
identified and mutations in this gene were found to cause PXE
(exemplarily: Le Saux et al., 2000). The ABCC6 gene contains
31 exons and encodes a 165 kDa transmembrane transporter of
1503 amino acids. The physiological function of ABCC6 is still
unknown. To date, more than 300 causative ABCC6 mutations
have been identified. These include missense, nonsense, and splice
site mutations, as well as deletions and insertions. According
to current studies, PXE seems to be inherited in an exclu￾sively autosomal recessive mode (Plomp et al., 2004; Miksch et al.,
2005; Pfendner et al., 2007). Hence, PXE patients are homozy￾gous or compound heterozygous carriers of ABCC6 mutations.
Most mutations observed in ABCC6 are unique and the major￾ity of them are located within cytoplasmic domains of ABCC6.
The most frequent mutation found in PXE patients is a non￾sense mutation in exon 24, p.R1141X (c.3421C>T, rs72653706),
which is found in approximately 25% of the European patient
population. A larger deletion of exons 23–29 (c.2996_4208del)
represents the most common mutation (25%) in American PXE
patients. The mutation detection rate lies between 80 and 90%.
Consequently, in up to 20% of patients clinically diagnosed
with PXE, only one or no ABCC6 mutations were detected.
As a consequence of methodological limitations, small ABCC6
deletions/insertions in homozygous state could be missed by
direct sequencing approaches. Costrop et al. (2010) uncovered
about 25% of the missing alleles as deletions of various sizes
by performing multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification
(MLPA). These findings emphasize the importance of screening

Hendig et al. The genetics of PXE and related disorders
for deletion/insertions in the molecular diagnostics of PXE. Never￾theless, there still remain PXE patients with an incomplete ABCC6
genotype. Consequently, other genetic causes or environmental
factors may be involved in PXE manifestation.
GENETIC INTERACTIONS
The recent identification of inherited disorders related to PXE
and characterized by soft tissue calcification suggests multiple
genetic factors. Vanakker et al. (2007) described a novel PXE-like
syndrome (MIM #610842), which is inherited in an autosomal
recessive mode, but caused by mutations in the GGCX gene,
encoding γ-glutamate carboxylase. Patients present with gener￾alized redundant skin folds, a mild retinopathy and a coagulation
defect of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors (Vanakker et al.,
2007). Similar cases had already been reported in the early 1990s
(Le Corvaisier-Pieto et al., 1996). Histological examination of a
skin biopsy reveals fragmentation and calcification of mid-dermal
elastic fibers identical to PXE. However, ultrastructural analysis
by electron microscopy showed differences in elastic fiber min￾eralization: in PXE-like syndrome, the calcification occurred in
the periphery of the elastic fiber rather than in the fiber core. Li
et al. (2009a,b) described two different families with combined fea￾tures of PXE and a vitamin K-dependent coagulation deficiency. In
both studies mutational screening of ABCC6,GGCX, andVKORC1
revealed two putative pathogenic mutations in GGCX in patients
presenting with distinct skin lesions and a coagulation factor defi￾ciency. Interestingly, the authors observed similar skin lesions in
the mother and her twin sister with no evidence of a coagula￾tion disorder (Li et al., 2009a). Mother and maternal aunt were
identified as compound heterozygous carriers of the recurrent
ABCC6 nonsense mutation p.R1141X and a missense mutation in
GGCX (p.S300F). The authors suggested that the skin phenotype
is because of digenic inheritance.
Generalized arterial calcification of infancy (GACI, MIM
#208000) is another rare autosomal recessive trait characterized by
soft tissue calcification (Rutsch et al., 2003). Mutations in ENPP1,
encoding for ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase 1, are the primary
cause of GACI. Patients present with extensive hydroxyapatite
deposition in large and medium-sized arteries, leading to arterial
stenosis and visceral ischemia. A recent study reported on a family
with two brothers (Le Boulanger et al., 2010). One was suffering
from PXE, while the other died at 15 months of age from a con￾dition similar to GACI. Molecular analysis of ABCC6 and ENPP1
in this family revealed two pathogenic ABCC6 mutations in het￾erozygous state as the primary cause of disease. Pathogenic ENPP1
mutations were not identified except for two common ENPP1
sequence variations. It remains speculative whether these lead to a
more severe disease progression. Following on from these results,
Nitschke et al. (2012) screened ABCC6 and reanalyzed ENPP1 for
pathogenic mutations in a larger cohort of patients with clinically
proven GACI (n = 92). The authors found 30 patients who did
not carry any ENPP1 mutations. Pathogenic ABCC6 mutations in
homo- or compound-heterozygosity were found as the primary
cause for GACI in 15 patients (Nitschke et al., 2012). The fact that
mutations in ENPP1 and ABCC6 manifest in overlapping clinical
phenotypes of GACI and PXE suggests similar metabolic pathways
are involved in the pathogenesis.
The significance of genetic interactions is further sup￾ported by experimental studies with Abcc6−/−;Ggcx+/+ mice in
which the onset of ectopic calcification was delayed, whereas
Abcc6−/−;Ggcx−/+ mice presented with accelerated mineraliza￾tion (Li and Uitto, 2010).
GENETIC MODIFIERS OF PXE
The variability in the outcome and progression of PXE may include
variations in several of the functional pathways involved in the
pathophysiology of the disease in addition to the loss of ABCC6
function. Detection of such “modifier genes” may uncover major
pathways involved in the pathogenesis and provide targets for
therapeutic intervention. Studies with Abcc6−/− mice support
the hypothesis of the contribution of other genetic factors in
PXE-related calcification since these mice present with different
phenotypes (Gorgels et al., 2005; Klement et al., 2005).
DEFINITION OF MODIFIER GENES
The “genetic co-factor” concept is not new, and was introduced
by Haldane as early as 1941 (Haldane, 1941). A primary reason
for searching for genetic factors modifying disease is to provide
information on the disease course and to improve therapies (if
available). Several definitions of so-called “modifier genes” exist
in the literature. We define a modifier gene as a gene that if
“mutated,” is insufficient on its own to cause disease, but when
coupled with another genetic mutation, produces or enhances its
pathogenesis. “Modifier genes” have been detected for cystic fibro￾sis, another monogenic disorder caused by an ABCC transporter
defect (ABCC7 gene) with variable disease onset and progression
(Cutting, 2005; Drumm et al., 2005).
SELECTION OF CANDIDATE GENES
In PXE several metabolic pathways seem to be affected, e.g., the
regulation of biological calcification, extracellular matrix (ECM)
remodeling and lipid transport and biosynthesis. Sequence vari￾ations in genes regulating these pathways may be involved in the
development and clinical course of PXE.
Regulation of biological calcification
Ectopic calcification is the result of a complex interplay between
stimulating and inhibitory proteins and metabolites. One can￾didate gene for PXE susceptibility is secreted phosphoprotein
1 (SPP1, formerly known as osteopontin). SPP1 fulfils impor￾tant functions in the regulation of biological calcification and
was also found to be a constitutive component of elastic fibers
in order to prevent them from calcification (Baccarani-Contri
et al., 1994). A study by Aherrahrou et al. described a dramatic
up-regulation of SPP1 expression in mice suffering from dys￾trophic cardiac calcification (DCC, Aherrahrou et al., 2004). The
Abcc6 gene was identified as the potential candidate gene for DCC
in mice (Korff et al., 2006). SPP1 is a predominantly transcrip￾tional regulated gene and the SPP1 promoter is highly conserved
among the human, murine, and porcine genes (Hijiya et al., 1994).
Several polymorphisms in SPP1 were shown to affect SPP1 expres￾sion (Giacopelli et al., 2004; D’Alfonso et al., 2005; Hummelshoj
et al., 2006). We found that the c.−1748G, the c.155_156insG and
the c.244_245insTG alleles appear to be significantly more com￾mon in PXE patients (Hendig et al., 2007). The polymorphism

“fgene-04-00114” — 2013/6/17 — 15:26 — page 3 — #3
Hendig et al. The genetics of PXE and related disorders
c.−155_156insG generates a RUNX2 (runt-related transcription
factor 2) binding site closed to a second RUNX2 binding site in the
SPP1 promoter. RUNX2 is an essential transcriptional regulator
of osteoblast differentiation and bone formation. Conclusively, we
interpreted three SPP1 promoter polymorphisms and the hap￾lotype combining these disease-associated alleles as a putative
genetic risk pattern for PXE.
Fetuin-A, was found to be a major systemic inhibitor of
calcification (Jahnen-Dechent et al., 2001). Carriers of fetuin-A
genotype 2 have been shown to have the lowest serum fetuin-A
concentration (Stenvinkel et al., 2005). Even though we did not
observe an association between PXE manifestation and fetuin-A
genotype, it could be speculated that fetuin-A genotype 2 is an
additional disease-promoting risk factor (Hendig et al., 2006).
Matrix gla protein (MGP) is a calcification inhibitor acting
locally. MGP was also found in the circulatory system, where it is
part of the so-called calciprotein particles, together with fetuin-A
and hydroxyapatite. The importance of MGP in preventing patho￾logical calcification is supported by Mgp-deficient mice, which
develop severe arterial calcification (Munroe et al., 1999). Analy￾sis of the MGP promoter polymorphism frequencies revealed one
MGP haplotype to be a potential protective genetic co-factor in
PXE (Hendig et al., 2008).
ECM-remodeling and oxidative stress
Several studies reported an increased ECM remodeling in skin of
PXE patients. In this context increased expression of proteases,
a mild oxidative stress, and an altered proteoglycan metabolism
was detected. The latter resulted in increased accumulation of
proteoglycans in the ECM, and in changes in the structure
and composition of urinary glycosaminoglycans (Longas et al.,
1986; Maccari et al., 2003; Kornet et al., 2004; Volpi and Maccari,
2005).
Many of the alterations observed in PXE could be explained
by oxidative stress, for instance ECM remodeling. We found
a correlation between genotype and age of disease onset for
polymorphisms in the genes catalase (CAT, c.262C>T), superox￾ide dismutase 2 (SOD2, c.47C>T), and glutathione peroxidase
1 (GPX1, c.593C>T), encoding essential antioxidant enzymes
(Zarbock et al., 2007). Furthermore, the age of disease onset was
inversely correlated with the number of mutated alleles, indicating
a cumulative effect on the time of PXE onset.
Elevated production of MMP2 (matrix metallopeptidase 2) in
PXE fibroblasts and increased levels of MMP2 andMMP9 in serum
from PXE patients were shown (Quaglino et al., 2005; Diekmann
et al., 2009). Increased MMP expression may at least partly result
from genetic variation. We have previously shown that variations
in MMP2 are a genetic co-factor for PXE (Zarbock et al., 2010).
We propose that xylosyltransferase I (XYLT, XT-I), as the initial
and most important enzyme in proteoglycan biosynthesis, and
XT-II, as a highly homologous protein, might contribute to the
increased ECM synthesis rate in PXE. As most XT-I is secreted
into the ECM, XT activity was proposed as a diagnostic marker
for the determination of enhanced proteoglycan biosynthesis and
tissue destruction (Götting et al., 2007). Moreover, elevated XT
activity was found in sera from PXE patients, reflecting the higher
proteoglycan biosynthesis rate (Götting et al., 2005). We further
showed that three sequence variants in the XYLT2 gene result in a
severe disease course of PXE (Schön et al., 2006).
Angiogenesis
Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in PXE-associated retinopa￾thy is believed to be mediated by the action of vascular endothe￾lial growth factor (VEGF). Intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy with
ranibizumab or bevacizumab is beneficial for the treatment of
CNV secondary to angioid streaks associated with PXE (Gliem
et al., 2013). It seems justified to assume that polymorphisms
leading to altered VEGF expression may modify the severity of
PXE retinopathy. Five VEGFA sequence variants showed signifi￾cant association with severe retinopathy in PXE (Zarbock et al.,
2009). We identified the most significant association for the vari￾ant c.-460C>T with an Odds Ratio of 3.8 (95% confidence interval
2.0–7.3, Pcorrected 0.0003). VEGFA gene polymorphisms might
prove useful as a prognostic marker for development of PXE￾associated retinopathy leading to earlier therapeutic intervention
in order to prevent loss of central vision.
Lipid biosynthesis and metabolism
About 50% in the general population present with dyslipidemia
which is a high risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD).
Familial hypercholesterolemia is caused by genetic variations in
different genes, including low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR)
and the apolipoprotein B (APOB). Heterozygous carriers arefound
with a frequency of 1 in 500. Dyslipidemia is likewise observed
in PXE patients and case reports suggested an impact of genetic
risk factors of lipid metabolism (LDLR mutations), for severe
complications such as stroke in PXE (Pisciotta et al., 2010).
GENETIC MODIFIERS IN Abcc6 DEFICIENT MOUSE STRAINS
Genetic examination of nine different mice strains predisposed
to more or less severe soft tissue calcification reveal a common
Abcc6 sequence variant in exon 14 as the primary trigger in four of
them (c.1866G>A, p.R621C, rs32756904). All these mice strains
are prone to soft tissue calcification, but present with immense
phenotypic heterogeneity. However, no modifier genes have been
identified so far, even though not the correct candidate genes (Ssp1
instead of Spp1) were evaluated in a recent study (Berndt et al.,
2012). Whole genome screening and careful evaluation of puta￾tive candidate genes will shed light on the role of genetic factors
contributing to soft tissue calcification caused by Abcc6 deficiency.
It will be of high interest to gain a deeper insight into the genetic
background of these mice strains.
ABCC6 VARIANTS AS GENETIC MODIFIER OF OTHER RARE
AND COMMON DISEASES
The occurrence of a mild skin phenotype was previously reported
in heterozygous carriers of ABCC6 mutations, although the find￾ings could not be replicated in another study (Martin et al., 2007,
2008; Plomp et al., 2009). By searching for biomarkers in biologi￾cal fluids of PXE patients, we and others observed that unaffected
first-degree relatives mostly display results, e.g., for serum fetuin￾A, desmosine, that were different from normal and intermediate
between that of the PXE patients and the controls (Annovazzi
et al., 2004; Hendig et al., 2006). Most of these individuals had

“fgene-04-00114” — 2013/6/17 — 15:26 — page 4 — #4
Hendig et al. The genetics of PXE and related disorders
been identified as heterozygous carriers of only one ABCC6 muta￾tion. Taken together, these results underline the assumption that
ABCC6 mutations on a single allele might determine a mild PXE
phenotype. This hypothesis might have great impact consider￾ing ABCC6 as genetic modifier of other rare monogenic disorders
(GACI), or common disease (stroke, myocardial infarction, and
CAD). Wang et al. (2001) reported an association of the frequent
ABCC6 p.R1268Q variant (c.3803G>A, rs2238472) with plasma
triglyceride and low HDL (high-density lipoprotein) cholesterol.
Peloso et al. (2010) replicated these data by identification of an
ABCC6 sequence variant (rs150468; c.3736-334A>C) as a sus￾ceptibility allele for low HDL cholesterol. Both studies led to
the suggestion that ABCC6 may be an important determinant of
plasma lipoproteins.
Few studies investigated the correlation of ABCC6 mutations
with cardiovascular disease and identified the frequent mutation
p.R1141X as a strong genetic risk factor for CAD (Trip et al.,
2002; Wegman et al., 2005; Köblös et al., 2010). However, a large
Danish Study including more than 13,600 cases, presenting with
ischemic vascular disease, could not replicate this findings (Horn￾strup et al., 2011). In conclusion, the impact of ABCC6 variants as
a genetic risk factor for common cardiovascular diseases remains
to be elucidated.
LIMITATIONS AND PERSPECTIVE
Monogenic diseases such as PXE and GACI represent simple mod￾els that teach us many things about the genetic basis of more
complex disorders, e.g., arterial calcification (Antonarakis and
Beckmann, 2006). Considerable variety in the clinical expression
of a monogenic disease might be explained by the effect of other
genetic factors that modify the expression of the disease pheno￾type. Many arguments support the concept of modifier genes and
genetic interactions. We suggest that genetic interactions, as one
example between ABCC6 and ENPP1, point toward new disease
entities which seem to be phenotypically similar to PXE or GACI at
first sight but differ in yet unknown features. Genetic modifiers are
discussed as concomitant factors contributing to the course of the
disease. The search for modifier genes is difficult but worth being
performed in view of better knowledge of biological pathways
affected by the disease. Moreover, numerous studies have identi￾fied such genes in mice. The availability of various mouse strains
carrying the same Abcc6 sequence variation associated with more
or less severe soft tissue calcification provides an excellent starting
point for functional studies and the investigation of interactions
between ABCC6 and specific modifier genes (Berndt et al., 2012).
The recent identification of modifier genes for PXE underscores
the importance of the analysis of gene–gene environment interac￾tions in understanding the development of complex phenotypes
such as PXE. As genetic modifiers are known to alter the course
and expression of disease, their gene products become interesting
targets for therapeutic intervention. Discovery of genetic modi￾fiers for example affecting the success of anti-neovascular therapy
could be, in the future, a key issue to obtain a personalization
of therapy and to avoid unnecessary costs in PXE. Nevertheless,
replication studies analyzing the new association of modifier genes
in other PXE patient cohorts are essential to determine whether
these modifier genes are indeed a genetic risk factor for PXE and
related disorders. Moreover, the importance of consistent phe￾notype measures and complementary study designs cannot be
overemphasized. Here, family studies and sibling analysis may help
to estimate the contribution of genetic and non-genetic factors.
