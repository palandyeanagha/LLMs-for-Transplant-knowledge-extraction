Objective: To study the characteristics of the haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets (HELLP)
syndrome in the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) and its influence on the subsequent pregnancies.
Methods: This was a retrospective analysis of 16 episodes of HELLP complicating APS in 15 women.
Results: HELLP was complete in 10 cases and partial in six. It occurred during the second trimester in seven
cases (the earliest at 18 weeks’ gestation), the third trimester in seven cases, and the day following delivery
in two cases. Pre-eclampsia was present in six cases and eclampsia in five. Outcome of pregnancies was:
live birth (n = 8), stillbirth (n = 2) and fetal death (n = 6). APS was primary in nine women and secondary to
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in six. HELLP revealed primary APS in six cases. Seven women were not
treated. Low dose aspirin was empirically prescribed in one woman whose APS had been undiagnosed
despite a history of two fetal deaths. In the other women, therapy consisted of aspirin (n = 8), low molecular
weight heparin with a dose varying between 3000 and 12 000 U daily (n = 5), and high dose
immunoglobulin every 4 weeks (n = 2), hydroxychloroquine (n = 4), and prednisone (n = 6). Six women
had seven subsequent pregnancies, 3–6 years after the complicated pregnancy. HELLP recurred at
33 weeks’ gestation in one woman with SLE treated with prednisone, hydroxychloroquine, aspirin, and
enoxaparin, and pregnancy ended in live birth. One woman became pregnant after in vitro fertilisation
and embryo transfer, but pregnancy ended in fetal death despite prednisone, hydroxychloroquine, and
enoxaparin. Four women had five uneventful pregnancies with 100 mg daily aspirin and heparin.
Conclusions: APS may be revealed by HELLP. In APS, HELLP is associated with pre-eclampsia/eclampsia
in most cases and seems to occur earlier than in the general population. Heparin plus aspirin may prevent
obstetric complications in the subsequent pregnancies.
I
ncidence of haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low
platelets (HELLP) syndrome in pregnancy has been
estimated at 0.01–0.2% in the general population, and at
10–12% in pregnancies complicated with pre-eclampsia/
eclampsia. During a 15 year period in a tertiary care centre
serving a population area with 40 000 deliveries per year, 442
HELLP syndromes were observed.1 During the same period,
2331 pregnancies were complicated by pre-eclampsia or
eclampsia. Reports of HELLP syndrome complicating APS
are scarce. We report a series of 16 episodes of HELLP
syndrome complicating primary or secondary APS in 15
women, and describe its characteristics and its influence on
the subsequent pregnancies.
PATIENTS AND DEFINITIONS
We retrospectively reviewed the data of 16 pregnancies in 15
women with APS complicated with HELLP syndrome.
Diagnosis of APS was based on the international criteria.2
Lupus anticoagulant (LA) was usually detected by activated
partial thromboplastin time (PTT), diluted thromboplastin
time, or kaolin clotting time. Abnormal coagulation times
were confirmed by mixing patient and control plasma on a
1:1 ratio in order to exclude clotting factor deficiencies. IgG
and IgM anticardiolipin (aCL) antibodies were measured by
ELISA. IgG and IgM rates were reported as negative if ,15 U/
ml, as low positive at 16–25 U/ml, as medium positive at 26–
80 U/ml and as high positive if .80 U/ml.
Diagnosis of HELLP was based on the presence of
haemolysis (anaemia with characteristic peripheral blood
smear), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) over the upper
normal value or total bilirubin .12 mg/l, elevated alanine
aminotransferase (AAT) .twofold the upper normal value,
and nadir platelet count below 125 000/mm3
. Complete
HELLP was defined by presence of all criteria, and partial
HELLP by the presence of two criteria.3 Diagnosis of systemic
lupus erythematosus (SLE) was based on the revised ACR
criteria.4 The other definitions were: (a) embryonic loss
(spontaneous termination of pregnancy prior to 10 weeks’
gestation)); (b) fetal death (according to Branch’s definition,5
death of a fetus demonstrated to be alive at or beyond
10 weeks’ gestation); (c) premature birth (termination of
pregnancy with a live birth below 37 weeks’ gestation); (d)
full term birth (termination of pregnancy with a live birth
between 38 and 40 weeks); (e) intrauterine growth retarda￾tion (IUGR) (birth weight below the 10th centile for the
stated gestation); (f) hypertension (diastolic pressure .90
mm Hg); (g) pre-eclampsia (hypertension complicated with
proteinuria >0.5 g/24 hours or oedema or both); and (h)
eclampsia (pre-eclampsia complicated with seizures or
fitting.
RESULTS
At the first episode of HELLP, the mean age was 30 years
(range 22–37). Seven women were nulliparous. Pregnancy
was the second in four women, the third in two women, the
fourth for one woman, and the tenth for one other woman.

Eight women had been previously pregnant with a total of 15
pregnancies. Two women had had a total of four normal
pregnancies before SLE/APS onset. Hence, 11 pregnancies
were complicated with fetal death (n = 9), embryonic loss
(n = 1), and live birth at full term of a growth retarded baby
(n = 1).
APS was primary in nine women and secondary to SLE in
six. Primary APS was known in only one of the women, who
had a history of repeated fetal loss and stroke; 2/8 women
with unknown primary APS had been undiagnosed, although
there was a suggestive history. One woman had a history of
two successive fetal deaths, and another woman had a false
positive syphilis test. Hence, HELLP revealed primary APS in
six cases.
Of the six women with SLE, APS was known in four, who
had a history of thrombophlebitis with fetal death (n = 2),
repeated fetal deaths (n = 1), and ischaemic cerebral stroke
with embryonic loss (n = 1). Two women with SLE had prior
asymptomatic aCL until onset of HELLP complicated with
fetal death (n = 2).
Seven women whose pregnancy was complicated by
HELLP had not been previously treated. Low dose aspirin
was empirically prescribed in one woman whose APS had
been undiagnosed despite a history of two fetal deaths. Three
women were treated with aspirin plus low molecular weight
heparin (LMWH) with a dose varying between 3000 and
8000 U daily. Two women with prior complicated pregnancy
under aspirin and LMWH were treated with LMWH 12 000 U
daily, aspirin 100 mg/day, and high dose immunoglobulin
80 g twice daily every 4 weeks. One woman with primary
ASP complicated with autoimmune thrombocytopenia was
treated with hydroxychloroquine and 5 mg daily prednisone.
All women with SLE, except one woman who was not
treated, received prednisone with a dose ranging between 5
and 30 mg/day and aspirin 100 mg/day. Hydroxychloroquine
was maintained in three women and withdrawn in two
others.
HELLP was complete in 10 cases and partial in six. It
occurred during the second trimester in seven cases (the
earliest at 18 weeks’ gestation), the third trimester in seven,
and in two cases, it appeared the day following delivery
(fig 1). The main characteristics of HELLP are summarised in
table 1.
Outcome of pregnancy was: live birth of a eutrophic
(n = 3) or a hypotrophic baby (n = 5), at full (n = 2) or
premature term (n = 6), stillbirth (n = 3), and fetal death
(n = 5). Table 2 summarises the pregnancy outcome accord￾ing to the date of HELLP onset. Fetal death and stillbirth were
observed only in HELLP occurring during the second
trimester. Apart from two women (one who developed
HELLP at 36 weeks’ gestation and another in the post￾partum period), all deliveries were made by caesarean
section. The main paediatric complications were observed in
a 25 week old premature newborn, who developed a severe
membrane hyaline disease evolving towards broncho￾pulmonary dysplasia. The child needed mechanical ventila￾tion for 43 days, and this period was complicated by multiple
infections, metabolic anomalies, enterocolitis, neutropenia,
and thrombocytopenia. Craniosynostosis needed surgical
repair 1 year later. At the present time, this child continues
to have retarded stature.
Pre-eclampsia was present in six cases and eclampsia in
five. Among these 11 cases, outcome of pregnancy was: fetal
deaths (n = 4), stillbirth (n = 3), and delivery of hypotrophic
(n = 3) or eutrophic (n = 1) liveborns. One woman had an
abrupted placenta. No hepatic infarction was observed.
Maternal therapy included anti-hypertensive therapy,
transfusion, and other supportive care, including mechanical
ventilation for 4214 days in three women. Dexamethasone
or betamethasone were prescribed in order to accelerate fetal
maturation. No patient needed plasma exchanges, and none
of the women died. One woman remained hypertensive and
needed permanent medication.
Six women had seven subsequent pregnancies, 3–6 years
after the pregnancy complicated by HELLP (table 3). HELLP
recurred at 33 weeks’ gestation in one woman (patient 1)
with SLE treated with prednisone, hydroxychloroquine,
aspirin, and enoxaparin. Caesarean section delivered a
2100 g live born child, and a rapid remission of laboratory
abnormalities followed. One woman became pregnant after
in vitro fertilisation and embryo transfer but pregnancy
ended in fetal death despite prednisone, hydroxychloroquine,
and enoxaparin (patient 2). Four women had five uneventful
pregnancies with 100 mg daily aspirin and heparin (patients
3–6).

At the present time, all women are doing well, with a mean
follow up of 7 years. No vascular complication was observed.
All the women with APS characterised only by obstetric
complications are being treated with 100 mg daily aspirin,
except one woman who has had no therapy. All women with
APS with both history of vascular occlusion and obstetric
complication are treated with oral anticoagulation. All six
women with SLE are in remission with prednisone (n = 4,
with a dose ranging between 2 and 12.5 mg daily) and/or
hydroxychloroquine (n = 6).
DISCUSSION
HELLP syndrome was described in 1982 by Westein as the
association of microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia, hepa￾titis, and thrombocytopenia in a particular group of pre￾eclamptic women, but there are no consensus criteria for its
diagnosis. In Martin’s study,6 HELLP was diagnosed on the
basis of thrombocytopenia ( 150 000/mL), hepatic dysfunc￾tion (increased AAT or alanine aminotransferase >40 U/l),
and haemolysis (increased LDH >600 U/l, progressive anae￾mia). Martin also classified HELLP on the basis of the platelet
count nadir: class 1 when platelet nadir is (50 000/mm3
,
class 2 at 50 000–100 000/mm3
, and class 3 at 100 000–
150 000/mm3
. Incidence of eclampsia, epigastric pain, major
maternal morbidity, and stillbirth increases as HELLP
worsens from class 3 to class 1. In Sibai’s study,1 HELLP
was diagnosed when pre-eclampsia was associated with all
the following laboratory abnormalities: characteristic periph￾eral blood smear, LDH.600 U/l (or total bilirubin .12 mg/l),
AAT.70 U/l, and platelet count ,100 000/mm3
. Audibert3
defined complete HELLP by the presence of all three of the
following criteria: haemolysis (characteristic peripheral blood
smear and LDH >600 U/l), AAT>70 U/l, and platelet count
,100 000/mL. Partial HELLP was defined by the presence of
one or two features of HELLP. Patients with complete HELLP
had a higher risk of caesarean section, disseminated
intravascular coagulation, and need for transfusion than
those with partial HELLP or pre-eclampsia.
The risk of HELLP is probably increased in APS. However,
its incidence is difficult to estimate from the literature,
especially after the recent changes in APS criteria.2 The
number of HELLP complicating APS cases reported in the
English literature is ,30. A recent literature review found 10
cases,7 to which should be added their two cases, seven cases
published in 2002–2003,19–22 six earlier cases,8 9 13 15 16 and a
few cases cited in APS pregnancies series.23–25 Our series of 75
pregnancies in primary or secondary APS23 included seven
women (also included in this study), who had eight episodes
of HELLP. Backos24 reported two HELLP in a series of 150 APS
pregnancies. In a placebo controlled study of intravenous
immunoglobulin treatment for APS, Branch observed that 6/
16 women developed severe pre-eclampsia and/or HELLP.25
However, most series of APS pregnancies did not report any
case of HELLP,26–36 although the rate of pre-eclampsia varied
between 0 and 51%.
The high rate of HELLP observed in our series (10.6%),
contrasts with 0.66% in that of Backos;24 this can be
explained by different recruitment criteria, as Backos
included only primary APS without history of thrombophle￾bitis. On the other hand, the frequency of APS in HELLP is
not well known. In our series, HELLP revealed APS in 8/15
cases. HELLP also revealed APS in half of the 24 well
described cases in the literature (table 4). A systematic
screening of thrombophilia in 93 women with a history of
severe pre-eclampsia/HELLP found antiphospholipid antibo￾dies in 66% of the cases.37 Although the cut off level was low
(5 U/ml), the difference in prevalence compared with controls
was significant (p,0.001). In France, a systematic search for
antiphospholipid antibodies in 68 consecutive cases of
complete HELLP among 15 000 deliveries, displayed nine

positive cases. Seven of these were subsequently tested, and
only two were diagnosed as primary APS. Hence, APS
prevalence in HELPP is estimated at 326%.7
In our series, HELLP occurred in 44% of the cases during
the second trimester and 12.5% at 18–20 weeks. In a
literature review of the 24 well described cases of HELLP
complicating APS, HELLP occurred also before 27 weeks’
gestation in 16 cases (table 1). Early HELLP onset was
described in association with APS as early as at 8 weeks’
gestation.20 In Sibai’s study,1 HELLP occurred in 2.5% of the
cases at 17–20 weeks, in 71% of the cases at 27–36 weeks, in
18% at 37–42 weeks, and in 30% during the post-partum
period.
HELLP appears more severe in APS than in the general
population. In our series, more than two thirds of the cases
were associated with pre-eclampsia/eclampsia, and two cases
were complicated by microangiopathic coagulopathy. Six of
the 24 cases of well described HELLP complicating APS were
associated with pre-eclampsia (table 1). We did not observe
any case of liver infarction, which Pauzner found to be almost
always associated with APS.20 In one case of HELLP in APS,
hepatic involvement was due to complete thrombosis of
hepatic veins.13
HELLP may also be part of the catastrophic syndrome,
similarly to Hochfeld’s case.9 Catastrophic APS is an acute
and devastating disseminated coagulopathy defined by the
clinical involvement of at least three different organ systems
over a short period.38 One fatal case of HELLP with
catastrophic syndrome was characterised by bone marrow
necrosis.19
In our study, all HELLP resolved with delivery and/or
supportive care. There was no case of maternal death,
similarly to the series of Backos and Branch.24 25 In the
general population, HELLP syndrome mortality is about 1%.1
In the literature, besides the catastrophic syndrome, some
cases of HELLP complicating APS were refractory to
corticosteroids and anticoagulation. Treatment of refractory
HELLP is not standardised. Remission may be observed after
plasma exchanges.22 Dexamethasone appeared to be more
effective than betamethasone.39 Combination of plasma
exchanges with fresh frozen plasma has been advocated.1
In our studies, six women had seven subsequent pregnancies
treated with aspirin plus LMWH; one pregnancy was
complicated by HELLP recurrence but resulted in live birth,
another one with embryonic loss. The other pregnancies
ended in live birth. There are no data concerning the risk of
HELLP recurrence in APS. Of four cases of HELLP complicat￾ing APS, Pauzner reported one recurrence of liver infarction
despite aspirin and 60 mg daily enoxaparin.20 In the general
population, HELLP recurred in 5% of subsequent pregnancies
in women with a history of HELLP at (30 weeks’ gestation.40
In conclusion, APS may be revealed by the HELLP
syndrome. Search for antiphospholipid antibodies is manda￾tory in such circumstances. In APS, HELLP is associated with
pre-eclampsia/eclampsia in most cases, and seems to occur
earlier than in the general population. Heparin plus aspirin
may prevent obstetric complications in the subsequent
pregnancies.

Vertebral slippage causes taxi drivers’ back pain
Across sectional study linking acquired lumbar spondylolisthesis with taxi drivers may
ultimately lead to preventive measures against this important cause of disabling back
pain. It is the first analytical study to show a link with this occupation.
Not only was taxi driving significantly associated with acquired spondylolisthesis (ASL),
those who had worked as taxi drivers longest had the highest risk. Drivers with 15 years’ service
or more had over three times the risk than drivers with up to 5 years’ service, and drivers with
6–15 years’ service had almost twice the risk, after adjustment for confounding factors. Age,
overweight or obesity, and frequent strenuous exercise were also associated with the condition.
Baseline data from the taxi drivers health study, part of a Taipei city government backed
programme to monitor taxi drivers’ health, were used for the regression analyses. The data
covered a sample cohort of 1242 registered taxi drivers in the city who had been operating for at
least one year during the first five months of 2000. ASL was diagnosed as non-lytic
spondylolisthesis above L5 from lumbosacral x ray films; demographic data and data about the
job and health behaviours were taken from standard self administered questionnaires.
Our knowledge about ASL comes mostly from descriptive work, but identifying the
environmental and work factors on which to base preventive measures needs more population
based studies. The next step will be to test these results in prospective studies and then to
pinpoint work exposures carrying a risk for the condition.
