Abstract
Understanding of the natural history and basic biology of hepatitis
B virus (HBV) has increased greatly in recent years. In view of this,


the following are reviewed here: (a) recent advances in HBV
biology pertinent to the rheumatic disease population; (b) the risks
of HBV reactivation in patients with rheumatic disease undergoing
immunosuppression; and (c) potential strategies to manage these
risks.
•  ALT, alanine aminotransferase
•  anti-HBc, antibody to hepatitis B core antigen
•  anti-HBs, antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen
•  HBcAg, hepatitis B core antigen
•  HBeAg, hepatitis B e antigen
•  HBsAg, hepatitis B surface antigen
•  HHBV, hepatitis B virus
•  HCC, hepatocellular carcinoma
•  IFN, interferon
•  TNF, tumour necrosis factor
•  hepatitis B virus 
•  biologic therapy
•  immunosuppression
