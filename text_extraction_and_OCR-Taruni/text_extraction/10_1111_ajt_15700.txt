ABSTRACT
Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are a lymphocyte subset with intrinsic immunosuppressive properties 
that can be expanded in large numbers ex vivo and have been shown to prevent allograft 
rejection and promote tolerance in animal models. To investigate the safety, applicability and 
biological activity of autologous Treg adoptive transfer in humans, we conducted an open-label, 
dose escalation, Phase I clinical trial in liver transplantation. Patients were enrolled while 
awaiting liver transplantation or 6-12 months post-transplant. Circulating Tregs were isolated 
from blood or leukapheresis, expanded under GMP conditions, and administered i.v at either 0.5-
1 million Tregs/kg or 3-4.5 million Tregs/kg. The primary endpoint was the rate of dose limiting 
toxicities occurring within 4 weeks of infusion. The applicability of the clinical protocol was poor 
unless patient recruitment was deferred until 6-12 months post-transplantation. Thus, only 3 out 
of the 17 patients consented while awaiting liver transplantation were dosed. In contrast, all 6 
patients consented 6-12 months post-transplantation received the cell infusion. Treg transfer 
was safe and transiently increased the pool of circulating Tregs and reduced anti-donor T cell 
responses. Our study opens the door to employing Treg immunotherapy to facilitate the 
reduction or complete discontinuation of immunosuppression following liver transplantation.

INTRODUCTION
Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are a subset of cluster of differentiation (CD4)-positive T cells that 
constitutively express the Forkhead Box P3 (Foxp3) transcription factor and have the capacity to 
migrate to sites of inflammation and exert a wide range of immunosuppressive effects. Animal 
studies indicate that Tregs play a key role in maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing 
autoimmunity (1). Furthermore, they can recognize allogeneic major histocompatibility complex 
(MHC) molecules and suppress allograft rejection, and are essential for the induction and 
maintenance of transplantation tolerance through the mechanisms of ‘linked suppression’ and 
‘infectious tolerance’ (2). 
Although human Tregs constitute a small proportion (5-7%) of circulating CD4+ T cells, they are 
attractive candidates for immunotherapeutic purposes given that they can be isolated and 
expanded in large numbers in vitro without losing their immunoregulatory properties (3). Clinical 
studies have demonstrated the safety of Treg adoptive transfer in graft-versus-host disease and 
type 1 diabetes mellitus (4–7). Furthermore, a number of trials have been initiated both in kidney 
and in liver transplantation (8,9). Liver transplantation constitutes an appealing clinical setting to 
evaluate the effects of Treg transfer given the lower immunogenicity of liver allografts and the 
substantial clinical experience that has been derived from trials of complete immunosuppression 
discontinuation (10). In this setting, infusion of a single dose of a Treg-enriched autologous 
leukocyte cell product (generated by culturing peripheral blood mononuclear cells with 
irradiated donor leukocytes in the presence of costimulation blockade), was recently shown to 
successfully induce operational tolerance in 7 out of 10 splenectomised living donor liver 
transplant recipients treated with cyclophosphamide and conventional immunosuppression (11). 
Despite these encouraging early results, key questions regarding the overall clinical applicability 
of Treg immunotherapy, the optimal clinical design, and the immunological effects of Treg 
infusion in human liver transplant recipients remain to be answered. We recently described the 
first Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP)-compliant protocol for the ex vivo expansion of 
polyclonal Tregs from prospective liver transplant recipients (12). This protocol, which included 
up to three rounds of stimulation in the presence of Rapamycin, was successful in expanding 
circulating Tregs >100-fold, maintained their Foxp3 expression levels and increased their

suppressive function. Importantly, expanded Tregs exhibited a stable non-inflammatory 
phenotype even after being challenged with a cocktail of inflammatory cytokines. We report 
here the results of a First-in-Human Phase I clinical trial evaluating the safety and immunological 
effects of purified, ex vivo expanded and adoptively transferred autologous polyclonal Tregs in 
adult liver transplant recipients. 
MATERIALS & METHODS
Study Design
This was a two-site, open-label, dose escalation, Phase I clinical trial conducted at King’s College 
Hospital London and University Hospitals Plymouth (UK), assessing the safety, applicability and 
biological activity of autologous Treg immunotherapy in the setting of adult cadaveric liver 
transplantation. Participants received a single intravenous infusion of ex vivo expanded 
autologous polyclonal Tregs 3-16 months post liver transplantation. The trial was approved by 
the UK National Research Ethics Service (Reference 13/SC/0604, 10/1/2014) and the Medicines 
and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), and was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov 
(identifier NCT02166177). All data supporting the results in the paper will be archived in an 
appropriate public repository.
Participants
Patients were initially enrolled while awaiting liver transplantation and their participation 
confirmed on the day of transplantation. Inclusion criteria at the time of transplantation were: 1) 
age 18-70 years; 2) MELD score 25; 3) no previous transplantation or need for simultaneous 
liver-kidney transplantation; 4) absence of autoimmune disease, active viral disease, EBV 
seronegativity or hepatocellular carcinoma outside of Milan criteria; 5) Leukocyte count 
>1500/uL and platelet count >50,000uL; 6) recipient of a brain dead liver donor; 7) recipient of a 
cardiac death liver donor if donor age <50 years old, warm ischemia time <20 minutes and cold 
ischemia time <8 hours. For Treg isolation, 250mL of whole blood were collected during the 
induction of anesthesia. Participants received Thymoglobulin induction (3 doses of 1.5 mg/kg i.v 
between post-transplant days 1 to 7), Tacrolimus (1 mg twice daily on post-transplant day 1 with 
doses subsequently adjusted to reach 5-8 ng/mL trough levels), and Methylprednisolone (500mg

intra-operatively followed by tapering and discontinuation on post-transplant week 10). 
Between post-transplant weeks 6 and 8, patients initiated Rapamycin (5-8 ng/mL trough levels) 
and decreased the levels of Tacrolimus (2-5 ng/mL). Three months post-transplant a liver biopsy 
was performed to exclude subclinical allograft damage and patients were admitted for Treg 
infusion. 
Due to the difficulties of enrolling patients prior to transplantation when following the protocol 
described above, 26 months after its initiation the trial design was amended and all subsequent 
patients were recruited 6-12 months post-transplantation. Otherwise, the same 
inclusion/exclusion criteria were maintained. Immediately after enrolment, patients had their 
immunosuppressive regimen switched to combined Tacrolimus and Rapamycin (trough levels 2-
5ng/mL and 2-8 ng/mL, respectively) and two months afterwards they underwent leukapheresis 
to collect the starting material for Treg manufacture. This was followed by a protocol liver biopsy 
and by the infusion of Tregs 4 months after enrolment. The amended study protocol did not 
require Thymoglobulin induction. This Phase I trial did not include attempts at 
immunosuppression discontinuation.
Dose escalation 
Two doses of expanded Tregs were assessed: 0.5-1 million Tregs/kg and 3-4.5 million Tregs/kg. 
Dose escalation criteria were as follows: i) after the treatment of the first 3 patients with 0.5-1 
million Tregs/kg, if dose limiting toxicities were observed in 1/3 patients, the cohort would be 
expanded to 3 additional patients at the same dose; ii) if toxicity was observed in ≥2 out of the 6 
patients, dose escalation would stop; iii) if 0/3 or ≤1/6 dose limiting toxicities were observed in 
the 3 or 6 patients, then the dose would be defined as well tolerated and a new cohort of 3 to 6 
patients would be treated with 3-4.5 million Tregs/kg. 
Study endpoints
The primary endpoint was the rate of dose limiting toxicities within the 4 weeks following 
infusion. Dose limiting toxicities were defined as: a) occurring in the first 72 hours post infusion 
including: National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE; 
Version 4.0) ≥grade 2 cytokine release syndrome, ≥grade 2 injection site reaction, ≥ grade 2 fever

and/or rigors, ≥grade 3 bronchospasm, ≥grade 3 hypoxia; (b) occurring in the first 30 days of the 
infusion including: ≥grade 3 infection, ≥grade 3 haematological complication, any CTCAE ≥grade 3 
toxicity not clearly related to underlying disease, moderate or severe acute rejection. Secondary 
endpoints were: acute and chronic toxicity associated with Treg infusion; incidence of 
major/opportunistic infections; malignancy; rejection; graft loss; patient mortality; sequential 
liver and renal function tests; immunosuppressive drug doses and levels; changes in 
immunological parameters following Treg infusion.
Isolation and manufacture of polyclonal Tregs
250 mL of whole blood or 180 mL of leukapheresis product were collected and transferred to the 
GMP Cell Therapy. The manufacture protocol as well as the phenotypic characteristics, functional 
properties and stability of the expanded Tregs have been previously reported (12) and are 
described in detail as Supplementary Information. 
Treg infusion
Patients were admitted on the day of infusion. The cryopreserved Treg product was thawed in a 
37C water bath, diluted in an infusion bag containing 50mL of 5% human albumin solution 
(Albunorm, Octapharma) and infused via a peripheral cannula over 15 minutes with an additional 
50 mL of 5% human albumin added to the bag to ensure delivery of the full dose. Pre-medication 
consisted in oral Paracetamol (1g) and chlorphenamine (4mg) 30 minutes prior to infusion. All 
patients were monitored for 12 hours post infusion prior to discharge. 
Immunomonitoring studies
Specimens: sequential peripheral blood samples were collected at 9 different time points 
between enrolment and the end of follow-up. Blood was collected into EDTA vacutainers and 
employed fresh in flow cytometric experiments or used to isolate peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells (PBMCs) that were cryopreserved. Serum specimens were isolated and cryopreserved.

infusion, 7 days and 1 month afterwards, employing the Food & Drug Administration (FDA)-
approved PleximmuneTM test (13,14). This assay uses flow cytometry to quantify the number of 
recipient CD8+ CD45RO+ memory T cells expressing CD154 following 16h culture with surrogate 
donor PBMCs (matched to donor at a minimum of one antigen each at human leukocyte antigen 
(HLA)-A, -B, and -DR loci) or 6-loci mismatched third party PBMCs). Similar experiments were 
conducted to quantify the frequency of CD154-positive memory CD8+ T cells following culture 
with an overlapping peptide mix of CMV pp65 antigen.
Detection of serum cytokines and chemokines: We employed the LEGENDplex™ Multi-Analyte 
Flow Assay kits (Human Cytokine panel 2, Human Proinflammatory Chemokine panel and Human 
Th Cytokine panel) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 
Flow cytometry and time-of-flight mass cytometry (CyTOF) immunophenotyping: The flow 
cytometry reagents and staining protocols employed were designed and standardized in 
collaboration with the ONE Study EU Consortium and have already been described 
(Supplementary Table 1) (15). The antibody panel, staining protocol and data analysis strategy 
for the CyTOF experiments are described as Supplementary Information. 
RESULTS
Patient flow, changes to study design and clinical outcomes
Between 2/6/2014 and 9/8/2016 a total of 414 patients awaiting liver transplantation were 
screened to participate in the trial, 17 were consented, 10 withdrew from the study before or at 
the time of transplantation, and 7 were transplanted (Figure 1). Out of 7 patients who were 
transplanted, 4 were withdrawn from the study before Treg infusion due to: 1) hepatic artery 
occlusion requiring re-transplantation followed by death caused by disseminated fungal 
infection; 2) development of proteinuria that precluded initiation of Rapamycin; and 3) failure to 
manufacture the required number of Tregs (in 2 patients). The remaining 3 patients received an 
infusion of 1 million Tregs/kg 83-110 days post-transplant and were followed-up for a total of 12 
months. Following the protocol amendment, we screened 125 patients between 12/9/2016 and 
1/3/2017 and consented 6 patients 221-354 days post-transplant. All 6 proceeded to receive an 
infusion of 4.5 million Tregs/kg (Figure 1) 112-151 days after enrolment and were followed-up for 
6 months following Treg infusion. All 9 patients received the stipulated immunosuppression

regimen as per protocol; there were no episodes of rejection during the follow-up period and all 
protocol liver biopsies performed before Treg infusion revealed normal histology or minimal 
changes (data not shown). Patient characteristics are summarised in Table 1 and Supplementary 
Table 5.
Manufacture of ex vivo expanded Tregs
Tregs were isolated from 11 patients (5 from whole blood and 6 from leukapheresis). The 
manufacture process failed in 2 patients (all of them from the first cohort of patients). The first 
case was due to insufficient number of Tregs (49 million Tregs), likely resulting from the very low 
number of Tregs isolated from blood (1.5 million Tregs as compared to 5.9 million, which was the 
mean from all whole blood Treg isolations). The second failure was due to a low frequency of 
Tregs in the final product (46% of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+). In the 9 successful manufacture runs, cells 
were expanded 21 to 486 fold yielding between 1250 and 22,530 million cells containing 61-92% 
Tregs. As compared to whole blood, the use of leukapheresis products allowed a reduction in the 
duration of Treg culture (from 36 to 24 days) and the need for lower expansion rates to achieve 
the target dose (Table 2). The use of immunosuppressive drugs by the trial participants at the 
time of leukapheresis did not hamper the Treg manufacture process, as Tregs were successfully 
expanded from all 6 recipients recruited 6-12 months post-transplant (Table 2). 
Characteristics of manufactured Tregs and effects on the phenotype of circulating immune cells 
following infusion
In the 6 patients who received the 4.5 million Tregs/kg infusion, a transient increase in circulating 
Tregs was noticeable by flow cytometry as soon as 3 days post-infusion and persisting for 1 
month. This increase was larger than what was observed after initiating Rapamycin and was not 
detected in the 3 patients receiving 1 million Treg/kg (Figure 2A). To better understand the fate 
of the infused Tregs and their impact on the pre-existing Treg compartment in the 6 patients 
receiving 4.5 million Tregs/kg, we conducted an in-depth phenotypic characterisation using 
CyTOF in sequentially collected samples (Figure 2B-E). We first performed a hierarchical 
clustering analysis to compare the phenotypic heterogeneity of expanded and circulating Tregs. 
The expanded Tregs were more homogeneous than the corresponding circulating Tregs,

reflecting the effects of the prolonged in vitro culture (Figure 2C). A more detailed analysis 
revealed that the expanded Tregs were more proliferative than the pre-infusion circulating Tregs 
(as assessed by Ki67 expression) and exhibited higher levels of CD25, CTLA4, CD38, Gata binding 
protein 3 (GATA3), Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1), CD274 (PD Ligand 1), OX40, CD69, 
HLA-DR, CD7 and lower levels of Helios, chemokine receptor (CCR)-7, C-X-C chemokine receptor 
(CXCR)-4 and CD127 (Figure 2D). We next investigated whether, following infusion, circulating 
Tregs exhibited changes in the markers that were most characteristic of the manufactured cells. 
One week after infusion we detected a significant increase in the expression of CD38, which was 
no longer detected 3 weeks later (Figure 2E). A similar trend was observed for Ki67, CD7, HLA-DR, 
CD274, PD1, and CTLA4 (Supplementary Figure 1). To better track the infused Tregs and to 
explore their impact on the population structure of the pool of pre-existing circulating Tregs, we 
identified the three sub-populations of circulating Tregs that most resembled expanded Tregs 
phenotypically (Figure 3A and Supplementary Figure 2) and plotted their evolution over time. In 
keeping with the flow cytometric experiments, the density of the three sub-populations 
increased noticeably 7 days after infusion, but this was no longer apparent 1-month post infusion 
(Figure 3B and C). We performed exhaustive immunophenotypic experiments on circulating non￾Treg immune cell subsets as well, using both flow cytometry (Supplementary Tables 3&4) and 
CyTOF (Supplementary Figures 3&4), but observed no significant changes in association with the 
infusion of Tregs.
Safety of Treg infusion
No adverse events were observed after infusing 1 million Tregs/kg in Patients P01-P03. Patient 
P04, however, developed fever >39C associated with rigors (CTCAE ≥ grade 2) without 
hemodynamic compromise 16 hours after having received 468 million Tregs (4.5 million cells/kg). 
The patient developed transient neutropenia, lymphopenia and mild liver graft dysfunction 
(Figure 4A). Detailed radiological and microbiological evaluations were negative. Serum cytokine 
analysis revealed a significant increase in interleukin (IL)-12 p40 (IL-2p40), IL-27, C-X-C motif 
chemokine ligand (CXCL)-10 (CXCL10), C-C motif chemokine ligand (CCL)-2 (CCL2), IL-5, IL-2, 
interferon gamma (IFNG), CXCL9 and CXCL11 1 day after Treg infusion with gradual decrease by 
day 3 and complete normalization by day 7 (Figure 4B). As per the study protocol, the high-grade

pyrexia was considered a dose limiting toxicity and resulted in the expansion of the 3.0-4.5 
million Tregs/kg cohort to 6 participants. The infusion of Tregs did not result in serum cytokines 
changes in the remaining 5 patients receiving 4.5 million Tregs/kg (Figure 4B). Of note, the levels 
of IL-12p40, IL-18, IL-27, IL-33, CCL17, CCL3, CXCL10, CXCL9 and CXCL11 were already higher in 
P04 than in the remaining participants immediately before Treg infusion, suggesting that the 
adverse event may not be solely attributable to the Treg infusion. 
Impact of Treg infusion on donor-specific T cell responses
In the 6 recipients who received 4.5 million Tregs/kg, a gradual decrease of T cell responses (as 
assessed by the up regulation of CD154 on memory CD8+ T cells) directed against donor-type 
cells was observed (p-value=0.066). While these changes did not reach statistical significance, the 
trend was clearly different from the responses directed against third-party cells (p-value=0.3) or 
the Cytomegalovirus (CMV) pp65 antigen (p-value=0.5), which remained stable throughout the 
study period. In contrast, in the 3 recipients dosed with 1 million Tregs/kg we observed no 
decrease in donor-specific T cell responses in association with cell infusion (Figure 5). 
DISCUSSION
Liver transplantation constitutes an optimal clinical scenario to explore the effects of novel 
immunotherapeutic approaches, as it provides an experimental setting in which the timing and 
identity of the antigenic challenge are known and the therapeutic intervention can be planned so 
as to minimize the influence of clinical confounders. Furthermore, the accumulated clinical 
experience with trials of immunosuppression withdrawal has provided a clear understanding of 
the kinetics of rejection and/or tolerance and allowed the stratification of patients according to 
their immunological risk. 
Our study was designed to investigate the feasibility of Treg adoptive transfer in liver transplant 
recipients and to determine the safety and immunological effects of this intervention. Key 
aspects of the trial design were: i) the isolation of Tregs immediately before transplantation; ii) 
the use of Thymoglobulin to induce lymphodepletion and reduce effector T cells; iii) the 
administration of combined immunosuppression with low dose Tacrolimus and Rapamycin to 
minimize the deleterious effects of these drugs on Treg function (21,22); and iv) the decision to

defer cell infusion until 3 months post-transplant to protect Tregs from the effects of 
Thymoglobulin and to avoid the complications often observed shortly after surgery. The overall 
applicability of this protocol was very low. This was mainly due to the small proportion of 
patients awaiting transplantation who met the strict inclusion/exclusion criteria. Additional 
hurdles were the unpredictable timing of the surgical procedure when employing cadaveric 
donors, which put considerable strain on the GMP facility; the frequent use of marginal liver 
grafts in our centre; the development of complications either before or after transplantation that 
compromised the safety of the study; and the difficulties of growing large numbers of Tregs 
under strict GMP conditions from peripheral blood collected at the time of transplant. As such, 
our experience greatly differs from the clinical study reported by Todo et al. in Japan(11), in 
which 10 consecutive living donor liver transplant recipients were treated with a non-GMP cell 
product. The clinical implementation of the study drastically improved after allowing inclusion of 
stable recipients 6-12 months post-transplant (although due to the strict eligibility criteria its 
overall applicability was still low). This provided enough time to perform an elective 
leukapheresis and reduced the high drop-out rate observed when approaching patients before 
transplantation. Thus, following the amendment, all 6 participants consented were successfully 
dosed. Of note, Thymoglobulin induction was removed from the amended protocol, as this 
medication has been associated with a high incidence of immune side effects such as cytokine 
storm when administered to patients who have not been pre-treated with high-dose 
immunosuppressants (23,24).
The safety profile of the Treg manufactured product was very good, with no increased incidence 
of infections or cancer and only a single patient experiencing an infusion reaction, classed as a 
dose limiting toxicity. While the doses of Tregs infused were lower than what has been 
administered in type 1 diabetes(7), our highest dose was in the range of the number of Tregs 
contained within the cell product infused in the liver transplant trial from Japan (31-466 x 106
CD4+Foxp3+ T cells)(11). The lack of signs of over-immunosuppression is very reassuring, 
considering that the Tregs had been expanded under polyclonal conditions and were therefore 
potentially capable of exerting non-specific suppressive effects. This finding is important and has 
implications for the development of alternative immunotherapies currently under evaluation, 
such as donor-reactive Tregs and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-expressing Tregs (3,25), which

preferentially recognize the transplanted organ and therefore should even be safer than the cell 
product tested in our trial. 
Tregs are long-lived and tend to migrate to the sites of inflammation. The kinetics of persistence 
and migration of ex vivo expanded Tregs following adoptive transfer, however, is still not well 
understood. In murine transplant models Tregs tend to accumulate in the graft and draining 
lymph nodes (26,27), although Lee et al. were not able to detect transferred Tregs beyond 14 
days after infusion into murine islet transplant recipients(28). In non-transplanted non-human 
primates, adoptively transferred Tregs were shown to be short-lived, as their numbers declined 
rapidly during the first week after infusion(29,30), albeit a small number of cells were still 
detected both in blood and in secondary lymphoid tissues for >50 days (29). In human 
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, infused Tregs could be tracked in blood using HLA 
markers up to 14 days (5). On the other hand, in type 1 diabetes and kidney transplant patients, 
expanded Tregs labelled with Deuterium exhibited a peak in the circulation 7-14 days after 
infusion and rapidly decreased thereafter, with approximately 20% of them being still detectable 
in blood 1 year after infusion (7,8). In the patients enrolled in our study and treated with 4.5 
million Tregs/kg the number of circulating Tregs rapidly increased following infusion and 
remained higher than before infusion for at least 1 month. These transient changes likely 
corresponded to the detection of adoptively transferred Tregs, given that they were not 
observed after initiating Rapamycin treatment and closely matched the kinetics that have been 
observed following the transfer of Deuterium-labelled Tregs. Furthermore, CyTOF experiments 
revealed that the rise in circulating Tregs was associated with increases in the specific Treg sub￾populations that most closely resembled the infused Tregs. The changes in the repertoire of 
circulating Treg subpopulations were however very transient and did not persist as long as the 
increase in the total number of circulating CD25highCD127- Tregs. This suggests that ex vivo 
expanded Tregs rapidly change their phenotype following infusion or, alternatively, that 
endogenous Tregs proliferate and contribute to the enlarged Treg compartment observed 
between weeks 1 and 4 post-infusion. Neither our study nor previously published reports, 
however, can adequately address the homing and long-term viability of adoptively transferred 
Tregs. The fact that they do not persist in large numbers in the circulation may denote 
accelerated cell death as a result of low IL-2 availability or preferential migration into peripheral

tissues. This will remain an open question until non-invasive imaging technologies capable of 
tracking injected cells for long periods of time are successfully developed in humans. 
The development of donor specific hyporesponsiveness is considered one of the hallmarks of 
transplantation tolerance. An intriguing finding of our study is the impact of the transferred Tregs 
on donor-reactive T cell responses, which, in the 6 patients who received 4.5 million Tregs/kg, 
decreased 1 week after infusion and remained low 4 weeks after adoptive transfer, without 
obvious changes being observed in T cell responses directed against third-party alloantigens or 
CMV. This is a highly unusual finding, which has not been reported in comparably stable liver, 
intestine or hepatocyte transplant recipients longitudinally monitored with the same 
alloreactivity assay (31–33). The fact that patients who received 1 million/kg Tregs did not 
develop donor-specific hyporesponsiveness further suggests a potential causal and dose-effect 
relationship, although we cannot exclude an influence of Thymoglobulin-induced lymphopenia, 
which only observed in the low-dose Treg cohort. Of note, the pattern of donor-specific T cell 
responses observed by Todo et al. following cell infusion was similar to what we detected in our 
trial(11). While it is not possible to formally establish a causal link between the development of 
donor hyporesponsiveness and Treg infusion, our findings could be explained by the preferential 
survival and/or proliferation after infusion of Treg clones with anti-donor alloreactivity, which is 
an observation that has been documented in experimental animal models(26). This would be in 
keeping with the lack of clinically apparent non-specific immunosuppressive effects observed 
following Treg infusion. Alternatively, the infused Tregs could have amplified the well￾documented capacity of liver allografts to delete donor-reactive T cell clones (34,35).
In summary, we have described here the successful expansion under GMP conditions of 
polyclonal Tregs isolated from both end stage liver disease patients awaiting liver transplantation 
and stable liver transplant recipients under maintenance immunosuppression. Treg infusion was 
safe, well tolerated and exerted a potentially beneficial effect on donor-specific immune 
responses. The implementation of the clinical protocol was however challenging and its 
applicability was reliant on deferring patient recruitment and cell infusion until at least 6 months 
post-transplant. Future studies should address the capacity of this strategy, alone or in 
combination with lymphodepletive therapies, to facilitate the reduction or even the complete 
discontinuation of anti-rejection medications following liver transplantation.
