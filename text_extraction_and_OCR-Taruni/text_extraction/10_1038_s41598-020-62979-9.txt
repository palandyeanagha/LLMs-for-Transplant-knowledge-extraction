With the aim to explore innovative tools for organ preservation, especially in marginal organs, we 
hereby describe a clinical trial of ex-vivo hypothermic oxygenated perfusion (HOPE) in the field of 
liver (LT) and kidney transplantation (KT) from Extended Criteria Donors (ECD) after brain death. 
A matched-case analysis of donor and recipient variables was developed: 10 HOPE-ECD livers and 
kidneys (HOPE-L and HOPE-K) were matched 1:3 with livers and kidneys preserved with static cold 
storage (SCS-L and SCS-K). HOPE and SCS groups resulted with similar basal characteristics, both for 
recipients and donors. Cumulative liver and kidney graft dysfunction were 10% (HOPE L-K) vs. 31.7%, 
in SCS group (p=0.05). Primary non-function was 3.3% for SCS-L vs. 0% for HOPE-L. No primary non￾function was reported in HOPE-K and SCS-K. Median peak aspartate aminotransferase within 7-days 
post-LT was significantly higher in SCS-L when compared to HOPE-L (637 vs.344U/L, p=0.007). Graft 
survival at 1-year post-transplant was 93.3% for SCS-L vs. 100% of HOPE-L and 90% for SCS-K vs. 100% 
of HOPE-K. Clinical outcomes support our hypothesis of machine perfusion being a safe and effective 
system to reduce ischemic preservation injuries in KT and in LT.
The gap between patients candidate to liver or kidney transplant and the actual organ availability is a prominent 
issue for transplant centres worldwide, and has a significant impact for such patients in terms of morbidity and 
mortality1,2
. Nevertheless, the number of discarded organs is increasing constantly, primarily as a consequence of 
the increasing average age of the donor pool1
.
Several data demonstrate how the use of marginal liver and kidney allografts, defined according to the 
Extended Criteria Donors(ECD), may represent a valid strategy to enlarge the donor pool and to offer more 
transplant opportunities otherwise unachievable only with Standard Criteria Donors (SCD)3–6
. However, the use 
of ECD organs still entails a considerable price to pay: an increase of primary non-function (PNF) or delayed 
graft function (DGF) in kidney transplant (KT) and early allograft dysfunction (EAD) in liver transplant (LT), 
and a decrease of long-term survival7
 not related to the experience of the transplant centers8
. Cold ischemia time 
(CIT) and warm ischemia time during reperfusion impair ECD grafts – being those highly vulnerable organs 
– but at the same time do not increase mortality risk, which remains relevant for patients in waiting list9
. These 
evidences lead scientific transplant community to explore new strategies for the preservation of marginal grafts,

which appear more vulnerable when treated with standard techniques, such as static cold storage (SCS). Different 
innovative preservation methods in KT and LT are currently under investigation in animal models, pre-clinical 
and clinical trials, comparing different strategies, ranging from hypothermic (4–10 °C) to subnormothermic (20–
25 °C) – including controlled oxygenated rewarming – and normothermic (35–37 °C) conditions10. Early clinical 
evidences from the Zurich group support the benefit of hypothermic oxygenated perfusion (HOPE) as confirmed 
for LT clinically11 and on rat models for KT experimentally12. Conversely, in United Kingdom, normothermic 
machine perfusion (NMP) for preservation of LT and KT achieved an optimal safety, feasibility and efficacy13,14. 
Subnormothermic machine perfusion (SMP) and controlled oxygenated rewarming (COR) were experienced 
in animal models demonstrating the improvement in renal or liver function and superiority when compared 
to SCS15–17, but to present only COR in LT was applied in clinical practice with good results of feasibility and 
short-term transplant outcomes18.
Our preliminary experimental study on human discarded kidneys and liver grafts19 lead us to confirm the 
role of dynamic preservation and the need for oxygen provision to restore ATP levels, despite the fact that their 
clinical marginal features had labeled such organs as un-transplantable. Therefore, based on our previous findings 
and several positive suggestions above mentioned11,12, we designed an interventional clinical trial to apply HOPE 
as preservation technique in liver and kidney transplant procedure. HOPE was performed through a machine 
perfusion purposely developed for abdominal organs perfusion in our center. Outcomes data were elaborated to 
determine safety and efficacy of HOPE treatment in extended criteria donors after brain death (ECD-DBD) for 
LT and KT.
Results
Donor and recipient characteristics. Between October 2016 and December 2017, N= 20 recipients 
(N=10 LT recipients and N=10 KT recipients) were recruited consecutively and transplanted with ECD-DBD 
organs preserved from surgical back-table to implantation by HOPE (Table 1). The main indication for LT was 
hepatocellular carcinoma on cirrhosis with one or more etiologies: alcoholic liver disease (N=2), hepatitis C 
virus infection (N=5), hepatitis B and D virus infection (N=2), hepatitis B virus infection (N=1) and primary 
biliary cirrhosis (N=1); only one patient was affected by alcoholic cirrhosis only. Recipients of KT had end-stage 
renal disease with the following etiologies: interstitial nephritis (N=1), renal polycystosis (N=2), hypertensive 
renal vascular disease (N=1), diabetic nephropathy (N=1), hypertensive nephrosclerosis (N=2), membranous 
glomerulonephritis (N=1), nephroangiosclerosis (N=1) and chronic glomerulonephritis (N=1).
The study population was properly matched with the control group (Table 1) and no significative differences 
were reported between the two groups.
Median donor age was very extended: 77.5 (60–84) years for HOPE-L group and 71.5 (60–78) years￾for HOPE-K group compared to 75.5 (53–85) years for SCS-L group and 69.5 (59–79) years for SCS-K group 
(p=n.s.).
Median recipient age was 57.5 (50–68) years for HOPE-L group and 61 (50–66) years for HOPE-K group 
versus 60.5 (48–68) years for SCS-L group and SCS-K group (p=n.s.).
In the L-HOPE group, the median CIT was 7.1 (6.1–9.6) hours: a value time comparable to 7 (5.4–10) of 
L-SCS group and very low because the perfusion treatment started at the time of the organ back-table and the 
livers were immediately transplanted.

The median CIT for the kidney group was about 14hours, partly due to the fact that we do not perform KT 
during the night in our centre. However, this data was still comparable among the HOPE-K and SCS-K groups, 
14.5 (10.8–22) hours versus 14 (8–21) hours respectively.
Furthermore, L-HOPE and L-SCS groups were matched similarly for MELD score, previous abdominal sur￾gery and portal thrombosis.
In the HOPE-K group, one patient receiving double KT was matched with 3 double KT cases in the control 
group.
The median of Karpinsky’s score was 3 for SCS-K group and 4 for HOPE-K group. Type and time of dialyses 
were also equally distributed between study and control group.
Histopathological features. The liver histology of the study groups are reported in Supplementary 
Materials Table 1, where nine histological parameters were evaluated in HOPE-L and SCS-L. No statistically 
significant differences were reported.
Kidney histology are reported in Supplementary Materials Table 2: thirteen histological variables were evalu￾ated in HOPE-K and SCS-K. No statistically significant differences were found between the two groups.
Perfusion parameters and biochemical characteristics of the HOPE perfusates. The perfusion 
parameters of N=11 kidneys, N=9 for single KT and N=2 for dual KT, and N=10 livers undergoing HOPE 
before the implantation are reported in Table 2. No adverse events during organ perfusion were registered for 
study cases enrolled.
The median hepatic portal flow was 107.5 (65–116) mL/min and median perfusate lactate levels was 16.2 
(9–27) mg/dL, as reported in Table 3.
The median renal flow was 52.5 (24–85) mL/min and median perfusate lactate levels was 11.7 (6.3–22.5) mg/
dL, as reported in Table 3.
Oxygen level was in line to the reference limits during HOPE as demonstrated by the paO2 values at T4 in the 
Table 2.
The mean perfusion time was 2.2 (1–3.5) hours for HOPE-L group and 3.3 (1–6) hours for HOPE-K group. 
We had only 2 cases of single KT whose perfusion time was lower than 2hours, while all other cases had a longer 
perfusion time.
Bile or urine production were not assessed during the liver or kidney perfusion treatment, respectively.
Microbiological analysis of the perfusate specimens did not evidence any bacterial or fungal growth defined 
as pathogen contamination and related to the perfusion strategy under study.
Graft function and post-transplant complications. Variables related to graft dysfunction were showed 
in Table 4. Overall graft dysfunction, defined as EAD in the HOPE-L and DGF in the HOPE-K groups, was 10%

vs. 31.7% in the control group, p=0.05. Primary non-function was 0% for both K-groups and 6.6% for SCS-L vs. 
0% for HOPE-L, p=0.086.
L-HOPE group had 0% of EAD versus 23.3% of L-SCS group. As result of this data, the peak of aspartate 
aminotransferase within 7-days post-LT decreased over 50%: the median value of AST was 637 (124–2100) U/L 
in L-SCS group vs. 344 (166–1032) U/L in L-HOPE group, p=0.006 (Fig. 1). Also, alanine aminotransferase, 
bilirubin and INR levels were lower in L-HOPE recipients than in the L-SCS group.
Liver graft assessment following transplantation (L-GrAFT) risk score decreased significantly in the L-HOPE 
group, with a L-GrAFT risk score percentage of 18.82±7.10%, compared to 27.03±11.36% in L-SCS group 
(p=0.047).
Looking at the kidney transplant subset, the study population showed a trend to a better outcome, with only 
20% of DGF compared to 40% in the control group. The only two DGF events in the HOPE-K group took place 
when the perfusion time for single KT was lower than 2 hours; the remaining 8 cases in the HOPE-K group 
had no DGF events. Comparing K-HOPE patients receiving a graft which underwent perfusion treatment for 
more than 2 hours to grafts with shorter perfusion time, the rate of DGF was statistically significant (0% vs. 
40%, p=0.04). Overall, early post-operative complications according to the Clavien-Dindo classification were 
comparable among the study groups, without reaching any statistical significance (see Supplementary Materials 
Tables 3, 4).
Biliary/ureteral strictures and organ rejection. Biliary and ureteral strictures were monitored for 1 
year of follow-up after transplant, without observing differences in HOPE recipients vs. SCS group [L-HOPE 
group=1/10 (10%) versus L-SCS group=3/30 (10%); K-HOPE group=1/10 (10%) versus K-SCS group=2/30 
(6.6%)]. Likewise, the incidence of acute rejection was similar between study and control groups [L-HOPE 
group=1/10 (10%) versus L-SCS group=4/30 (13.3%); K-HOPE group=1/10 (10%) versus K-SCS group=2/30 
(6.6%)].
Hospitalization, graft and patient survival. No significative differences were reported in term of 
median hospital stay for LT (11 days HOPE vs. 12 days SCS) and KT (17 days HOPE vs. 24 days SCS). All grafts 
and patients in the HOPE groups survived at 1-year post-transplant, with no significative differences when com￾pared to control groups. In the L-SCS group graft survival was 90% due to two PNF events and one case of mul￾tiorgan failure secondary to sepsis; moreover, patients’ survival was 90%: one death for infectious complication 
and two for recurrence of liver disease. In the K-SCS group, graft survival was 93.3% due to two graft failure cases, 
one due to renal vein thrombosis in single renal transplant and one due to multiorgan failure following bacterial 
sepsis in dual renal transplant; patient survival was 96.6% due to one event of death for infectious complication 
(Table 4).
NGAL in perfusate correlates with better renal transplant outcome. We splitted HOPE-K recipi￾ents in two different subsets, based on NGAL median value detected at T1 (19pg/mL) and we monitored eGFR of 
HOPE-K group at 1st, 3rd and 6th month after kidney transplantation: patients with perfusate NGAL>19pg/mL 
reported significantly higher eGFR at each time point (Fig. 2). Non statistically significant correlations between 
other markers of acute kidney injury and eGFR at 1st, 3rd and 6th month after kidney transplantation are shown in 
Supplementary Materials Fig. 1.
In the liver perfusate (HOPE-L), pGST, Albumin and Beta2-microglobulin were detected with increased val￾ues at T2 when compared to T0 (Supplementary Materials Table 5), but no statistically significant linear cor￾relations are evidenced when compared with AST, ALT and total bilirubin (at 1st, 3rd and 6th month after liver 
transplantation), or CIT and time of perfusion (Table 3).
We also measured NGAL, Calbindin, Clusterin and Osteopontin in the liver perfusate: we reported different 
values in T1 compared to T0 (Supplementary Materials Table 5) with non statistically significant linear correla￾tions when compared with AST, ALT and total bilirubin (at 1st, 3rd and 6th month after liver transplantation), or 
CIT and time of perfusion (Table 3).

Discussion
The present prospective pilot non-randomized clinical study suggests how hypothermic oxygenated machine 
perfusion results effective and safe in both liver and kidney transplantation. While administration of oxygen 
through machine perfusion for liver preservation was largely investigated in a previous clinical study20, few 
reports described HOPE in KT21. Since 1964, several in vivo and preclinical studies report the oxygen use in 
hyperbaric and normobaric conditions to perfuse renal grafts22,23. Here, we report the first clinical trial of HOPE 
in kidney transplant, reporting safety and efficacy in reducing ischemic preservation injuries.
The use of the same perfusion device for liver and kidney grafts results as one of the most innovative find￾ing of the present study compared to other previous studies11,13,14,24: organ perfusion with this machine is easily 
performed and it may be initiated at the time of surgical graft preparation during the “back-table” procedures, 
avoiding unnecessary CIT extension.
An increasing number of researches suggest how the beginning of hypothermic oxygenated perfusion soon 
after graft retrieval promotes the reduction of waste products, such as succinates, that usually accumulate in the 
graft during static storage, and increasing the restoring of mitochondrial function25,26.
Our protocol begins with a 30–40 minutes graft washing during organ preparation, with the aim to remove 
waste products commonly released and accumulated during ischemia time. Furthermore, we equipped our organ 
perfusion system with an adsorbing hemofilter able to remove cytokines and to avoid fat embolism. After the 
washing phase, oxygenation of the preservation solution begins, with recirculation of the same fluid. We believe 
this strategy may replace the necessity to immediately start graft perfusion at the end of the retrieval, if CIT is 
maintained low, as in our study. Metabolites quantification in the perfusates during the flushing phase, compared 
to the usual perfusion time, may demonstrate the benefit of the washing strategy prior to recirculation of HOPE. 
The limit of our study is due to the lack of these data.
The missing of additional perfusates at regular times during perfusion, may represent a further limitation: a 
regular analysis of perfusates could be helpful to better understand organ metabolism during perfusion.
In the present study no adverse events were reported as a consequence of perfusion treatment and the out￾come was excellent, with no occurrence of graft dysfunction in HOPE-L despite advanced donor age. No graft 
failure was registered in HOPE-K, and only two cases had DGF. Moreover, recipients in HOPE-K with DGF 
had undergone perfusion treatment for less than two hours, as compared to non-DGF patients which actually 
underwent perfusion treatment for more than 2hours. Therefore, based on our experience, we suggest that kidney 
perfusion should last at least two hours; this treatment time could be possibly longer, as suggested by a pre-clinical 
study27.
This clinical series – to the best of our knowledge – is the first report of HOPE in ECD kidney transplantation; 
therefore, there are no data about renal preservation issues to compare our results with. Similarly to HOPE-L 
which is performed for at least one-hour, HOPE for renal grafts should last at least two hours, but future rand￾omized trials are needed to clarify this hypothesis11.
Many studies, even from our center, showed that hypothermic oxygenation during organ perfusion is able to 
restore ATP levels in liver and kidney grafts, improving the functional recovery after transplantation19,28,29. Our 
clinical results showed a better liver function with HOPE compared to SCS in the setting of marginal donation, 
without reported EAD events and lower hepatocellular enzyme release. A difference in terms of graft function

was more evident in the liver transplant subset, where we observed a 50% AST peak reduction in the liver HOPE 
group compared to the control group. This result is similar to that reported by Nasralla and colleagues in a con￾trolled prospective randomized trial on liver normothermic perfusion following organ retrieval30.
Furthermore, in the liver subset, post-operative liver function was improved in the liver HOPE group accord￾ing to the L-GrAFT risk score.
In addition to this positive clinical data, other relevant aspects of HOPE should be considered: first of all, the 
procedure proposed is simple in terms of organization and management; in particular, in our experience, a spe￾cialist perfusion technician was not required, and we had no adverse events related to the procedure. Secondly, 
the perfusion machine is cost-effective and less expensive compared to the subnormothermic or normothermic 
techniques. HOPE is performed requiring only a sterile perfusion line kit, including an oxygenator; on the other 
hand, subnormothermia or normothermia conditions require packed red blood cells or haemoglobin-based 
oxygen carriers, various perfusion solutions (i.e. Ringer’s solution), nutrient elements including multivitamins, 
sodium bicarbonate, heparin, antibiotics, prostacyclin, nutrient solution and creatinine. A further positive aspect 
of HOPE management, is the effectiveness of the strategy proposed despite advanced donor age in liver but also 
in kidney transplantation, with no graft loss due to non-function or dysfunction reported.
In this manuscript, we report only 1-year of clinical outcomes follow-up, including organ function, graft and 
patient survival; nevertheless the lower L-GrAFT risk score reported in the liver study group may suggest a better 
graft survival with a prolonged follow-up.
Recently, 5-year outcomes in donors after circulatory death (DCD) human livers preserved with HOPE were 
reported similar to DBD liver grafts and superior to the DCD liver grafts preserved with SCS31. Long-term out￾comes of machine perfusion in renal storage was reported only in the setting of hypothermic machine perfusion 
without oxygen. However, graft and patient survival were superior in the machine perfusion groups compared to 
the SCS groups, with the equalization of usage costs achieved at the 16th month post-transplant32. In our opinion,

the analyses of the long-term results of this clinical series could be of interest, as well as other similar research 
studies with higher sample size.
Simplicity, outcome benefits for liver and kidney transplantation and low-costs equipment are the winning 
points of our HOPE system. The safety of our new machine perfusion system was confirmed by the absence of 
adverse events and by the observation that liver hypothermic oxygenation could be effective to improve graft 
function, similarly to other reported series in the setting of normothermic blood perfusion30,33.
We also measured different markers in perfusates at the beginning and the end of perfusion procedure. 
Regarding KT, NGAL resulted a positive predictive biomarker of renal outcomes at 1st, 3rd and 6th month of fol￾low up: despite NGAL is largely known as a marker for acute and chronic renal injuries34–36, this result partially 
correlates with our previous findings, suggesting the role of NGAL as an immunomodulatory molecule, able to 
promote immune tolerance through regulatory T cells (Treg)37,38 therefore favoring better clinical outcomes.
In LT, significative differences of all perfusate markers were reported when measured at the end of perfusion if 
compared with the beginning. Recently Dutkosky et al.
39 demonstrated that mitochondrial flavin levels in perfu￾sates during hypothermic oxygenated perfusion might be a marker of better liver graft function. Our preliminary 
results confirm the relevance of markers in the perfusate and the fact that perfusate analysis is a further tool to 
predict clinical grafts outcomes. We are currently exploring a new field where further studies involving a larger 
sample size and a more comprehensive panel of biomarkers are needed, with the aim to detect optimal targetable 
markers to correlate with graft function or to confirm the results of Zurich center.
Summarizing, we consider our innovative system as a functional tool to allow marginal grafts transplanta￾bility, with the aim to reduce utilization avoidance of grafts which are actually discarded19,40,41. Moreover, the 
analysis of the perfusate may help to evaluate organ viability even in hypothermic conditions, and the infusion of 
therapeutic agents – e.g. nutrition, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) and extracellular vesicles releasing by MSC, 
anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic additives – might be a simple implement of the perfusion system in use42–45.
Future trials exploring this field must confirm not only safety and benefits, but also cost effectiveness, as some 
perfusion strategies are still associated with exorbitant costs.
In conclusion, HOPE for ECD-DBD grafts is safe and effective in reducing preservation injury and in improv￾ing graft function and outcomes for kidney and liver transplantation. Future randomized clinical studies with a 
representative sample size are needed to confirm our results and hypothesis.
Methods
Study design. This national, single-center, prospective interventional arm with a retrospective case-con￾trolled arm, pilot non-randomized clinical study was performed at the General Surgery and Transplant Unit of 
University of Bologna Sant’Orsola - Malpighi Hospital in accordance to the Helsinki Declaration. Ethical approval 
was obtained by local committee of University of Bologna Sant’Orsola - Malpighi Hospital in June 2016. The 
enrolment process of the interventional study arm was planned considering one procedure per month (liver or 
kidney perfusion before transplantation) following the inclusion criteria in the period from October 2016 to 
December 2017. The study was meant to evaluate the safety of a new machine perfusion system, and therefore we 
decided to monitor adverse events after each procedure for the first 30 post-operative days before enrolling other 
new cases. During the study period we performed 116 LTs, 60 of which met the inclusion criteria and 10 of which 
were included in the study according to the aforementioned safety protocol. Similarly we recluted 60 KTs, which 
met the inclusion criteria, and among those 10 were included according to the protocol. The study underwent 
clinical trial registration (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT03031067; 01/25/2017). The organ allocation process fol￾lowed our center algorithm6,8,46,47. Each patient included in the study group was transplanted with ECD graft, liver 
or kidney, restored in the pre-implantation phase by HOPE. Patients’ outcomes (HOPE-L and HOPE-K groups) 
were compared to the ones of matched control groups composed by liver and kidney recipients transplanted from 
January 2004 to September 2017 in the same transplant center, whose organs were preserved by SCS (SCS-L and 
SCS-K groups respectively).
Demographical, clinical, machine perfusion and histological data collection was performed prospectively for 
the study groups and retrospectively for the control groups.
Matching study and control cases. Study cases of HOPE-L and HOPE-K groups were matched 1:3 to 
control cases of SCS-L and SCS-K groups; the pairing was performed anonymously using different clinical fea￾tures about each donor and recipient involved.
HOPE-L and SCS-L groups were matched for donor and recipient age, CIT, model of end-stage liver disease 
(MELD) score, previous abdominal surgery and portal thrombosis.
HOPE-K and SCS-K groups were matched for donor and recipient age, (CIT), Karpinski’s score, dialyses type 
(peritoneal or hemodialysis) and dialyses time.
Recipient and donor selection. ECD-DBDs aged over 18 years were considered eligible for study inclusion 
after acquisition of informed consent by the family. Definition of ECD was applied according to the UNOS crite￾ria for kidney transplant (donors aged ≥60 years or aged 50–59 years with two or more other risk factors such as 
cerebrovascular accident, hypertension and serum creatinine >1.5mg/dL) and for liver transplant (donors with 
hemodynamic deterioration, age >65 years, BMI>30 kg/m2
, bilirubin >3 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase 
(AST) o alanine aminotransferase (ALT) above three times the upper reference threshold, sodium >165mmol/l, 
days on intensive care unit (ICU)>7, steatosis >40%, CIT>14 hours48,49).
Recipients aged over 18 years on liver/kidney waiting list to University of Bologna Sant’Orsola - Malpighi 
Hospital with favorable donor match were selected and included in the trial after acceptation of the informed 
consensus.

Combined organ transplant, donors or recipients with vascular anomalies, urgency transplants and 
re-transplantations were excluded from the study enrollment.
Organ retrieval and transfer. Livers/kidneys were harvested in a standard fashion and according to our 
policy for ECD5,50–52. At the end of the retrieval procedures, the organs were stored in cooling sterile bag with 
new SCS solution and transported to the transplant hospital, where we started the perfusion protocol in the study 
group.
Liver graft histopathological analysis. In order to verify the homogeneity between HOPE-L and SCS-L 
groups, as well as between HOPE-K and SCS-K groups, the graft histopathology was revised by two different 
pathologists in all cases.
Hypothermic oxygenated perfusion. After notification to the Health National System for the clinical use 
in organ perfusion, an innovative machine perfusion developed and described in a previous experimental study19
was used to perform ex-vivo hypothermic oxygenated perfusion.
This machine perfusion is composed by two pump units that produce a continuous and pulsatile flow to the 
vein or artery respectively, which is set at high values for liver perfusion (median value over 100mL/min) and at 
lower values for kidney perfusion (median value minor to 60mL/min).
Before HOPE set-up, the inner and outer sterile flow tubes were connected to the medical devices and the 
priming phase was started. Belzer University of Wisconsin machine perfusion solution was used for priming 
and organ perfusion steps. At the begin of surgical back-table, portal vein or renal artery were cannulated with 
special cannulas for organ perfusion of different sizes (8–12 F for kidney and 18–24F for liver). Each organ was 
connected to the perfusion device through the attachment of the vascular cannula to the inner perfusion tubes, 
already assembled to the machine. HOPE was performed at 4 °C, with a portal vein pressure of 5mmHg or renal 
artery pressure of 25mmHg and an oxygen partial pressure (paO2) of 600–750mmHg. Oxygen is provided to the 
fluid perfusion through the addition of a membrane oxygenator to the perfusion circuit. Flow, pressure and tem￾perature values were monitored frequently by the organ perfusion team involved and registered on USB memory 
support. Perfusate gas analysis were accomplished every 15 minutes on effluent perfusate samples to measure 
paO2, pH, and lactate production.
Sterility of perfusion treatment under study was tested performing microbial cultures on perfusion fluid 
before (T0) and after HOPE (T1).
Hypothermic oxygenated perfusion was performed in two steps: the first one was the flushing of the organ 
with hypothermic oxygenated solution for a duration of 30–40 minutes, and during the second step the organs 
were moved in a different box to permit recirculation of the perfusate until implantation.
Graft flushing started at the beginning of the back-table phase, thus without increasing the duration of the 
standard surgical steps. Flushing was performed with hypothermic oxygenated solution and after 30–40minutes 
of graft flushing, the organs were moved in the another organ container to permit recirculation of the oxygenated 
perfusate. The algorithm treatment is reported in Fig. 3.
Transplantation. According to the conventional procedures, surgical team performed kidney and liver 
transplants. Renal transplants were accomplished into iliac fossa anastomosing the artery to the external/com￾mon/internal iliac arteries, the vein to the external/common iliac veins and the ureter to the bladder over a single 
stent. Orthotopic liver transplantation was performed with “piggyback” technique preserving the inferior vena 
cava; epato-choledocal anastomoses were performed over T-tube.
Short and long-term post-operative course. Post-transplant medical care during the hospital stay, 
including antithrombotic and antimicrobial/antifungal prophylaxis, was managed applying the standard pro￾tocols53,54. According to transplant guidelines, immunosuppressive state of recipients was preserved administer￾ing induction therapy for KT, tacrolimus (optimal levels: 3–12ng/mL) with or without mycophenolate as either 
mycophenolatemofetil or mycophenolate sodium steroid dose decreasing. Long-term follow-up was carried out 
according to the local protocols at 1-, 3-, 6- and -12 post-transplant months, in a single-center without loss of 
patients at follow-up.
Transplant outcome. Graft survival as time, incidence of PNF and graft function as percentage of Liver 
Graft Assessment Following Transplantation (L-GrAFT) risk score or incidence of EAD for LT or DGF for KT 
were the measure tools to establish the HOPE effects on ECD-DBD donation in LT and KT. PNF was defined as 
organ failure ending to re-transplant for LT or constant dialyses recovery/transplantectomy for KT. EAD was 
defined if one or more of these lab values appeared: bilirubin>10mg/dL on post-operative day 7; INR>1.6 on 
post-operative day 7; aminotransferase level (ALT or AST)>2000 IU/mL within the first 7 post-operative days55. 
LGrAFT risk score was calculated on 1–10 post-LT days of AST, bilirubin, platelet counts and maximum INR 
values56. DGF was defined as the needing of dialyses treatment within the first week after the transplant; the effect 
on the outcome is expressed as an absolute number outcome57. Other follow-up data under study were: functional 
lab test values at 1-, 3-, 6- and -12 post-transplant months, incidence of biliary/ureteral fistula, incidence of graft 
rejection and the number of hospital readmission within 1 year from transplant.
Perfusate analyses. 5mL of perfusate were collected at the beginning (T0) and at the end (T1) of perfusion 
from the perfusion fluid in the organ container and centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 15min to remove cellular debris. 
The supernatant was transferred to 1-mL Coming cryogenic vials immediately after centrifugation and stored at 
−80’C for subsequent analysis. Samples were thawed at room temperature prior to use for analyses. The concen￾trations of early biomarkers of renal injury (Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin-NGAL, Osteopontin,

Beta2-microglobulin, Clusterin, Cystatin-C, Calbindin, Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1-MCP) and specific 
markers of liver functions (Glutathione S-transferases phosphorylate-pGST, ALbumin, Beta2-microglobulin) 
were measured using Luminex® xMAP® Technology. We created our own multiplex panel by combining mul￾tiple simplex kits: Human CustemProcarta Plex-19 plex (Invitrogen by Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat. No.PPX￾19-MXRWE2G) and Human High Sensitivity T Cell (Merck Millipore, Cat. No. HSTCMAG-28SK). The 
methodological details including assay protocol, standards and sensitivity are available at the manufacturer’s 
website, http://www.thermofisher.com and http://www.merckmillipore.com. All samples were measured undi￾luted and in doublets. The chemo/cytokine standards were assayed in the same manner as patient samples. The 
data were collected using a xPONENT® software (Luminex, Austin, TX, USA).
Study end points. The primary end point were the safety in the interventional arm and differences in terms 
of graft function between the two study groups. Graft function was measured considering the EAD for the liver 
and the DGF for the kidney. Liver function was also evaluated considering the L-GrAFT risk core and the peak of 
aspartate aminotransferase within 7-days post-LT.
The secondary en points included: graft and patient survival at one-year, post-operative complications accord￾ing to Clavien-Dindo classification and hospital stay.
Statistical analyses. Continuous data are reported as mean ± SD or median (range) depending on their 
distribution and compared by means of parametric (ANOVA, T test) or non-parametric (Mann-Whitney 
U test) analyses. Categorical data are presented as percentage values and compared using a Chi-squared test. 
Kaplan-Meier estimators were applied to perform the survival analysis. A p value <0.05 was considered as sta￾tistically significant.
