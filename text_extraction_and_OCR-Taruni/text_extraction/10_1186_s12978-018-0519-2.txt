Abstract
Background: Epidemiological literature regarding the effect of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) as a risk factor for
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) remains inconsistent. Furthermore, it remains debatable whether NAFLD is
associated with PCOS as a consequence of shared risk factors or whether PCOS contributes to NAFLD in an independent
fashion. Therefore, this meta-analysis was conducted.
Methods: This meta-analysis was conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Relevant studies published before May 2017 were identified and
retrieved from PubMed and Web of Science databases. The data were extracted, and the pooled odds ratios (ORs) and
95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated.
Results: A total of 17 studies were included into the present analysis. Compared to the control group, the risk of NAFLD
in the PCOS group was higher (OR = 2.25, 95% CI = 1.95–2.60). When stratified by BMI and geographic location, the results
indicated that the frequency of NAFLD risk was significantly higher in obese subjects (OR = 3.01, 95% CI = 1.88–4.82),
non-obese subjects (OR = 2.07, 95% CI = 1.12–3.85), subjects from Europe (OR = 2.00, 95% CI = 1.58–2.52), subjects from
the Asia-Pacific Region, (OR = 2.32, 95% CI = 1.89–2.84) and subjects from America (OR = 2.96, 95% CI = 1.93–4.55). In
addition, PCOS patients with hyperandrogenism (HA) had a significantly higher risk of NAFLD, compared with controls
(OR = 3.31, 95% CI = 2.58–4.24). However, there was no association between PCOS patients without HA and higher risk
of NAFLD (OR = 1.46; 95% CI =0.55–3.87). The results of this meta-analysis should be interpreted with caution due to the
small number of observational studies and possible confounding factors.
Conclusion: The meta-analysis results suggest that PCOS is significantly associated with high risk of NAFLD. Although this
association was independent of obesity and geographic region, it might be correlated with HA.
Keywords: Polycystic ovary syndrome, Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, Obesity, Hyperandrogenism, Meta-analysis
Plain English summary
At present, a question that should be addressed is whether
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is associated
with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) as a consequence
of shared risk factors, or whether PCOS contributes to
NAFLD in an independent fashion.
In the present study, a meta-analysis was performed to
shed some light into this issue.
A total of 17 studies were included into the meta￾analysis. PCOS was significantly associated with higher risk
of NAFLD, with an approximately 2.3-fold higher chance.
This association was independent of obesity and geographic
region but might be correlated with hyperandrogenism.
In conclusion, the screening for NAFLD is only needed
for hyperandrogenic women with PCOS, and not for all
women with PCOS.
Background
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is an increas￾ingly common form of chronic disorder in the Western
world, and is characterized by fat accumulation in the

liver, which is independent of significant alcohol consump￾tion, the use of steatogenic medications, or hereditary dis￾orders [1, 2]. NAFLD comprises of a wide spectrum of
liver diseases that range from simple steatosis to nonalco￾holic steatohepatitis (NASH), leading to cirrhosis [2]. Fur￾thermore, NAFLD prevalence markedly increases with age
[3]. The estimated prevalence of NAFLD in the general
population ranges within 6.3–33%, with a median of 20%
[2]. However, in obese or type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)
patients, the prevalence of NAFLD can increase to ap￾proximately 75% [4]. Most patients with NAFLD remain
asymptomatic, although it can slowly progress to cirrhosis,
thereby increasing the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC) [5]. NAFLD is also the most common cause of
cryptogenic cirrhosis [6]. Given its high prevalence and the
fact that NAFLD is becoming a major public health hazard,
it is very important to unveil its potential risk factors, since
early treatment can prevent the progression of liver disease.
Present evidence strongly indicates that obesity, T2DM,
unhealthy lifestyle, dyslipidemia, male gender and ethnicity
are risk factors for NAFLD development [2, 3]. Since most
patients with NAFLD have insulin resistance (IR), the asso￾ciation between NAFLD and IR has been widely accepted
[7]. In fact, the role of IR in the pathogenesis of NAFLD
has been thoroughly studied, and a strong association has
been shown [8, 9].
Another disorder associated with IR is polycystic ovary
syndrome (PCOS). PCOS is an exceptionally common
endocrine disorder in premenopausal women of repro￾ductive age. It is characterized by hyperandrogenism
(HA), chronic anovulation and polycystic ovaries (PCO)
through ovarian ultrasonography, when other etiologies
are excluded [10, 11]. It is possible that the link between
PCOS and NAFLD might be IR. Since the first associ￾ation between NAFLD and PCOS was reported in 2005
[12], many subsequent studies have investigated the as￾sociation between PCOS and risk of NAFLD. Some au￾thors have reported that patients with PCOS have a
higher prevalence of NAFLD than controls [13–15].
However, other studies failed to establish a relationship
between PCOS and the increased incidence of NAFLD
[16, 17]. Epidemiological literature regarding the effect
of PCOS as a risk factor for NAFLD development re￾mains inconsistent and inconclusive. A meta-analysis
that comprised of data until June 2013 was performed
by Ramezani-Binabaj et al. They reported that (1) the
prevalence of NAFLD noticeably increased in women
with PCOS, and (2) PCOS may be a significant risk factor
for the development of NAFLD [18]. However, the meta￾analysis was limited to only seven studies, and did not in￾clude stratified analyses. PCOS itself accounts for a higher
risk of NAFLD. However, other specific factors such as an￾drogen levels or body mass index (BMI) may contribute to
NAFLD development in women with PCOS. Since 2013,
many studies with larger sample sizes have reported
information on factors such as obesity and androgen
levels [13, 14].
Therefore, an update meta-analysis was conducted to
investigate the association between PCOS and the risk of
NAFLD development through studies published until
May 2017. In order to explore whether NAFLD is associ￾ated with PCOS as a consequence of shared risk factors,
or whether PCOS contributes to NAFLD in an independ￾ent fashion, stratified analyses were performed. Further￾more, factors associated with the presence of NAFLD in
PCOS women were identified, and evidence of character￾istics that can help identify women who have high risk of
NAFLD were provided.
Methods
This meta-analysis was conducted in accordance with
the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) [19].
The research question was formulated according to the
PICO model. P [population]: studies that recruited female
patients as participants; I [Intervention or Exposure]: PCOS
diagnosis; C [comparator]: PCOS group compared with the
control group; O [outcome]: NAFLD.
Literature search
A comprehensive search was performed on PubMed and
Web of Science databases for relevant published articles
and abstracts on the association between PCOS and
NAFLD published until May 2017. Merely studies per￾formed in humans and those reported in the English lan￾guage were considered. For PCOS, the following search
terms were used: ¨PCOS, polycystic ovary syndrome,
polycystic ovary¨. These terms were combined with the
following terms for NAFLD: ¨NAFLD, Non-alcoholic fatty
liver disease, NASH, non-alcoholic steatotic hepatitis, hep￾atic steatosis¨. For the association between PCOS and
NAFLD risk, “risk, risk factor” was used.
Two independent reviewers (R-X.S. and J.W.) completed
the initial screening process using pre-defined inclusion
criteria (as detailed below). Articles were included for fur￾ther review when these were original studies with primary
data, involved human subjects, and were related to the
topic of interest. These search results were independently
reviewed by two reviewers and were compared for discrep￾ancies. A third reviewer (X-Y.Y.) was involved to resolve
any discrepancies that may occur between the two re￾viewers. In addition, the reference list of selected studies
was manually reviewed for additional relevant publications.
Inclusion criteria
Studies were included in the meta-analysis when the fol￾lowing criteria were met: case-control studies, cohort stud￾ies and cross-sectional studies; studies that compared the
Wu et al. Reproductive Health (2018) 15:77 Page 2 of 9

prevalence of NAFLD in women with PCOS with matched
controls; studies that contained sufficient data for analyses;
studies published in the English language. For articles with
overlapping data of the same population source, only the
largest report was included.
Exclusion criteria
Articles were excluded when any of the following criteria
were met: (1) review articles, meta-analyses, letters, com￾mentaries, or case reports; (2) duplicates or continued
work of previous publications; (3) studies without complete
data; (4) articles that lack a control group; (5) articles not
published in the English language. Studies without
complete data, lack a control group and have overlapping
data of the same population source were the common
characteristics of the excluded papers.
Data extraction and quality assessment
Data extracted from each study included the following:
name of the first author(s), year of publication, geographic
region from which the study population was derived, diag￾nostic criteria for PCOS and NAFLD, and the sample size.
The baseline information and data were independently ex￾tracted by the two primary reviewers (X-Y.W. and J.W.)
using the same standard. The results were compared, and
disagreements were resolved by consensus.
The quality of the included studies was independently
assessed by two primary investigators (X-Y.W. and J.W.)
using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) [20]. Each
study was assessed based on three broad perspectives:
selection, comparability and exposure/outcome. The
score ranged within 0–9. Discrepancies were resolved by
discussion through a third author (X-Y.Y.).
Statistical analysis
The association between the prevalence of NAFLD in
women with PCOS and matched controls was calculated
using odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals
(CIs). In addition to the overall comparisons, subgroup
analyses were performed based on geographic region,
BMI, diagnostic criteria for PCOS and NAFLD, and an￾drogen levels from articles with available adequate data.
Heterogeneity between studies was assessed by Q-test
and I
2
-test. Heterogeneity was considered statistically
significant at P < 0.05 or I
2 > 50%, and a random-effects
model was applied.
In the assessment for publication bias, Begg’s test [21]
and Egger’s test were used [22]. If publication bias was
detected, Duval and Tweedie’s trim and fill method was
used to adjust the results [23]. In addition, a sensitivity
analysis was performed using the leave-one-out analysis.
Statistical analyses were conducted using Stata software
version 12 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA). P < 0.05
was considered statistically significant.
Results
Summary of the literature search
A flow chart depicting the criteria for selecting studies
for the present meta-analysis is shown in Fig. 1. In the
first search, a total of 221 publications were initially re￾trieved. Among these publications, 64 were excluded
due to duplication. After reviewing the remaining 157
abstracts, 137 publications that did not meet the prede￾fined inclusion criteria stated in the Methods section
were excluded. Furthermore, three studies were excluded
after reviewing the full texts due to insufficient data
[24–26]. Finally, 17 studies were included for analysis
[13–17, 27–38] (Table 1). The NOS scale was used to as￾sess the quality of studies included through the two in￾dependent reviewers. The NOS results revealed that the
average quality score was 5.2 (range: 4–6; Table 1).
Data analysis
A total of 17 studies that compared women with PCOS
with matched controls with regard to NAFLD risk
were included. There was no significant heterogeneity
in the included studies (I
2 = 4.6%, P-heterogeneity = 0.40).
Therefore, the fixed-effects model was used for the
meta-analysis. Compared to the control group, the
PCOS group had a significantly higher risk of NAFLD
(OR = 2.25, 95% CI = 1.95–2.60) (Fig. 2).
Subgroup analyses were also performed based on geo￾graphic region, BMI, diagnostic criteria for PCOS or
NAFLD, and androgen levels. When stratified by geo￾graphic location, a significantly increased risk for devel￾oping PCOS-associated NAFLD was found in Europe
(OR = 2.00, 95% CI = 1.58–2.52; Fig. 3a), the Asia-Pacific
Region, (OR = 2.32, 95% CI = 1.89–2.84; Fig. 3b) and
America (OR = 2.96, 95% CI = 1.93–4.55; Fig. 3c). Thus,
these results strongly support that PCOS is associated with
NAFLD risk, but is independent of geographic region.
According to the subgroup analyses based on the diag￾nostic criteria for PCOS, the effects of PCOS on NAFLD
risk did not significantly vary when either the Rotterdam
criteria (OR = 2.19, 95% CI = 1.88–2.55; Fig. 4a), or other
criteria (OR = 3.31, 95% CI = 1.89–5.82; Fig. 4b) was used,
including the National Institute of Health (NIH) criteria
and the Androgen Excess Society criteria. When stratified
by the diagnostic method for NAFLD using ultrasonog￾raphy, it was also found that PCOS was associated with
NAFLD risk (OR = 2.29, 95% CI = 1.96–2.67; Fig. 4c).
When stratified by BMI, in which non-obese subjects
were defined as BMI < 25 kg/m2
, a significantly increased
prevalence for NAFLD risk was found to be associated
with PCOS. This was found not only in obese subjects
(OR = 3.01, 95% CI = 1.88–4.82; Fig. 5a), but also in non￾obese subjects (OR = 2.07, 95% CI = 1.12–3.85; Fig. 5b).
Many studies have reported on the increased prevalence
of NAFLD in women with PCOS, and this was most likely
Wu et al. Reproductive Health (2018) 15:77 Page 3 of 9

due to obesity and IR, as previously suggested. The
present data indicates that women with PCOS have an in￾creased prevalence of NAFLD risk, which is independent
of obesity.
According to subgroup analyses based on androgen levels,
PCOS patients with HA have a significantly higher risk of
NAFLD than controls (OR = 3.31; 95% CI = 2.58–4.24;
Fig. 6a). However, in non-HA PCOS women, this was not
associated with increased NAFLD risk when compared to
controls (OR = 1.46, 95% CI =0.55–3.87; Fig. 6b). The re￾sults of the present study reveal that PCOS per se is not a
risk factor that leads to the development of NAFLD, and
HA is a contributing factor to the prevalence of NAFLD
in women with PCOS.
Overall, no evidence of heterogeneity was found in the
included studies when stratified by geographic region,

BMI and diagnostic criteria for PCOS or NAFLD. How￾ever, there was significant heterogeneity in non-HA studies
(I
2 = 83.3%, P-heterogeneity = 0.002; Table 2).
Sensitivity analysis and publication bias
Begg’s test and Egger’s test were used to assess for publi￾cation bias for the included studies. There was evidence
of publication bias in the overall meta-analysis for risk of
NAFLD (Begg’s test: P = 0.01; Egger’s test: P = 0.02). Fur￾thermore, the trim-and-fill method developed by Duval
and Tweedie was used to adjust for bias [23]. The ad￾justed result from the fixed model had an OR of 2.08
(95% CI = 1.81–2.40), which was similar to the results of
the present study (OR = 2.25, 95% CI = 1.95–2.60). Thus,
the results of the present study are reliable. A sensitivity
analysis was further performed by removing one study at
a time from the meta-analysis. None of the results were
significantly altered when a single study was removed.
The pooled OR ranged within 2.18–2.38, confirming the
robustness of these results.

Discussion
At present, epidemiological literature regarding the ef￾fect of PCOS as a risk factor for NAFLD development
remains inconsistent and inconclusive. This controversy
needs to be clarified, since the relationship between
PCOS and NAFLD is extremely relevant in clinic, both
disorders are common, and the coexistence might syner￾gistically increase the risk for both T2DM and cardiovas￾cular disease.
In order to shed some light, a meta-analysis that in￾cluded seven studies was conducted. It was reported that
the prevalence of NAFLD is markedly increased in
women with PCOS. Therefore, PCOS has emerged as a
significant risk factor for the development of NAFLD
[18]. However, a question that should be addressed is
whether NAFLD is associated with PCOS as a conse￾quence of shared risk factors, or whether PCOS contrib￾utes to NAFLD in an independent fashion. Therefore,
the present meta-analysis was conducted to shed light
into the relationship between PCOS and NAFLD. Ac￾cording to the results of the present meta-analysis,
women with PCOS had a 2-fold higher chance of devel￾oping NAFLD, which was independent of BMI and geo￾graphic region. Furthermore, hyperandrogenic women
with PCOS had a significantly higher risk of NAFLD
than controls. However, non-HA PCOS patients were
not associated with the increased prevalence of NAFLD,
when compared to controls. This finding suggests that

Wu et al. Reproductive Health (2018) 15:77 Page 6 of 9

the putative mechanism linking PCOS and NAFLD is
most likely associated with HA.
The association between hyperandrogenic women with
PCOS and NAFLD risk is supported by several biological
mechanisms. First, androgens can suppress the tran￾scription of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR)
gene, thereby prolonging the half-life of very low-density
lipoprotein (VLDL) and LDL. As a result, lipids accumu￾late in the liver, and hyperandrogenic women with PCOS
become more prone to fatty liver [39]. Second, hyperan￾drogenemia can induce a low-grade inflammatory state
by increasing the transcripts of the androgen receptor
and the release of TNF-α from mononuclear cells [40],
and both contributes to the development of NAFLD
[41]. Third, the pathogenesis of NAFLD is multifactorial,
but IR appears to be a pivotal contributing factor [7].
Both clinical observations and animal studies have dem￾onstrated that IR could be induced by hyperandrogen￾emia [42]. Su et al. reported that adult female mice
treated with testosterone exhibited IR via the blockade
of insulin signal transduction, without influencing body
weight and body fat content [43]. Another study con￾ducted by Polderman et al. reported that the testoster￾one administration to females can induce IR in healthy
subjects [44]. Finally, increased androgen levels can pro￾mote visceral fat accumulation by inhibiting adenosine
monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activa￾tion, which is a potent inhibitor of lipogenesis in adipose
tissues [45]. Visceral obesity is also associated with NAFLD.
Thus, an excess in androgen levels may contribute to
NAFLD in PCOS patients, affecting the liver directly or
indirectly through the modulation of insulin sensitivity, in￾creasing visceral adiposity, or a combination of both.
There were several limitations in the present meta￾analysis. First, although the collected publications were all
eligible, the studies included in the meta-analysis were
limited. Meanwhile, these limited number of studies pre￾cluded any meaningful subgroup analyses stratified by im￾portant confounding factors such as IR. Second, the
method used to assess NAFLD in the majority of studies

was ultrasonography, and it has been demonstrated that
liver biopsy is the gold standard for the diagnosis of
NAFLD. The advantages of ultrasonography include non￾invasiveness, reproducibility, low cost, and satisfactory
sensitivity and specificity for epidemiologic studies. Third,
publication bias existed among the involved studies. How￾ever, the trim and fill method was subsequently per￾formed. The OR after adjustment changed to 2.08, which
was almost consistent with the unadjusted result. Thus,
the present results are reliable. Fourth, it was found that
PCOS without HA was not associated with increased
NAFLD risk, when compared to controls. However, few of
the included studies had high heterogeneity. Finally, the
entire body of evidence was observational, which may be
biased due to unmeasured confounders. Although some
studies were adjusted for important confounding factors,
other modifiable factors were not accounted for in all
these studies, such as family history, differences in diet,
and/or physical activity patterns. Therefore, residual con￾founders may be present, which may influence these re￾sults. Thus, these observed effects may be attributable to
these factors, as opposed to PCOS alone. Conversely, it
could not be excluded that confounding factors may mask
a more influential factor, leading to the underestimation of
the effects of PCOS. Thus, future prospective high-quality
studies may be necessary to conclusively address this point.
Conclusion
In summary, the results of the meta-analysis suggest that
PCOS is significantly associated with high risk of NAFLD.
This association was dependent of androgen levels, which
is the main feature of PCOS, and was interrelated to IR.
These findings have clinical implications for NAFLD
screening in hyperandrogenic women with PCOS.
