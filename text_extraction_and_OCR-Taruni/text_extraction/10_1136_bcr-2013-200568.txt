SUMMARY
A previously well 66-year-old woman presented with
a recurrent transudative right-sided pleural effusion.
A nodular liver with coarse echotexture was
demonstrated on ultrasound and subsequent MRI found
hepatocellular carcinoma. In the absence of
cardiopulmonary disease and significant protein uria, the
recurrent pleural effusion was presumed to be hepatic
hydrothorax despite the absence of ascites or other
clinical features of chronic liver disease. The patient is
currently awaiting liver transplantation.
BACKGROUND
Hepatic hydrothorax is an uncommon differential
diagnosis of a transudative pleural effusion. It most
frequently occurs in the context of ascites and other
features of portal hypertension due to decompen￾sated liver disease. More rarely it may be the index
presentation for chronic liver disease and must
prompt appropriate workup for cirrhosis and causes
of decompensation including hepatocellular carcin￾oma (HCC). In this unusual case, hepatic hydro￾thorax was the only manifestation of decompensated
chronic liver disease, a scenario that has scantly been
described in medical literature. We therefore propose
that this important differential diagnosis for pleural
effusion warrants careful investigation and referral to
a gastroenterologist (or hepatologist) for further
workup and appropriate treatment.
CASE PRESENTATION
A 66-year-old Caucasian woman was admitted with
progressive dyspnoea, right-sided chest discomfort
and significantly reduced exercise tolerance.
At presentation she was tachypnoeaic with oxygen
saturations of 95% in air and afebrile. An examin￾ation of the chest revealed reduced expansion,
stony dullness to percussion and reduced breath
sounds on the right, consistent with unilateral pleural
effusion. She was obese (body mass index 40) and
was noted to have at least eight spiders naive her on
chest wall. However, there were no other peripheral
stigmata of chronic liver disease and examination of
the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and neurological
systems was otherwise unremarkable.
Six weeks previously she had undergone bilateral
salpingo-oophrectomy for symptomatic benign
ovarian cysts and required admission shortly after
to drain a pleural effusion in the context of ipsilat￾eral pneumonia. A total of 2 L of effusion was
drained on this admission.
She was a foster-career, normally fit and well and
had never smoked and consumed alcohol. She did
not take regular medication.
INVESTIGATIONS
On admission, she had a moderately raised C react￾ive protein and mildly deranged liver function tests
with a hepatitic pattern (albumin 30, aspartate ami￾notransferase 62, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase 129,
bilirubin 22, international normalised ratio 1.1). A
basic liver screen (hepatitis A, B and C viruses, anti￾nuclear antibody, antismooth muscle, antimito￾chondrial antibody, antiliver–kidney microsomal,
immunoglobulins) was unremarkable but α-feto
protein was moderately raised (5.9 units).
The chest X-ray demonstrated a reacculumation of
the right-sided pleural effusion (figure 1). Three litres
of clear pleural fluid was drained on this admission.
Pleural fluid protein and lactate dehydrogenase
(LDH) was consistent with a transudate via Light’s
criteria, serum protein was 68, pleural 23 and LDH
601; cytology demonstrated no malignant cells and
there was no growth on microbiological culture.
Liver ultrasound demonstrated features in keeping
with cirrhosis and a focal liver lesion consistent
sonographically with a simple cyst. Subsequent
contrast-enhanced CT of the chest/abdomen/pelvis
confirmed a simple pleural effusion but demonstrated
no additional features to suggest malignant disease,
and there was no ascites.
The urinary protein:creatine ratio was within
normal limits and transthoracic ECG showed a pre￾served LV function with no features of pulmonary
hypertension.
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
With a transudative pleural effusion in the absence
of other cardiopulmonary or renal disease, hepatic
hydrothorax secondary to liver disease was felt to
be the most probable cause. The cause of the liver
disease was uncertain. Given the patient’s body

habitus and normal liver screen, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease
seemed likely. Whereas a minority (approximately 5%) of malig￾nant effusions is transudates, the lack of any pleural thickening/
nodularity and any other intrapulmonary abnormalities, along￾side the liver investigations, excluded the need for more invasive
chest examinations (eg, thoracoscopy).
TREATMENT
As this was the second presentation with pleural effusion, talc
pleurodesis was attempted but there was recurrence of effusion
within 1 week of removal of the pleural drain. The oral diuretic
spironolactone was started and uptitrated to a dose of 200 mg
once daily which significantly improved the pleural effusion
while the patient underwent further assessment.
Management of hepatic hydrothorax involves management of
underlying decompensated chronic liver disease and specific
management for the hydrothorax.
The management of decompensated chronic liver disease is well
described by multiple international guidelines.1 Disease-specific
interventions should be employed where appropriate, after screen￾ing of liver under the care of a gastroenterologist/hepatologist.
Patients should be assessed for liver transplantation where
appropriate.
Specific management of the hydrothorax is similar to that of
ascites. In the first instance a combination of low sodium, high
protein diet, sodium restriction (sodium intake of 70–90 mmol/
day2
) and diuretics. Aldosterone antagonists and loop diuretics
can be used in isolation of combination although a rational
approach would be to begin with a single agent and uptitrate to
clinical response as would be appropriate to manage ascites.3
Symptomatic hydrothorax may require initial therapeutic
thoracocentesis. Options for recurrent reaccumulation of pleural
fluid include formal chest drainage with pleurodesis which has
been described.4 5 However, rapid reaccumulation of fluid from
increased portal pressures6 7 is common. There have been
reports suggesting that continuous airway pressure with the use
of tetracycline alongside pleurodesis may lower the peritoneal
gradient pressure and thus making pleurodesis more successful.8
Although data regarding this are limited and apart from a
widely cited abstract, there has been no other evidence to
support this. Indwelling pleural catheters (with intermittent
domiciliary drainage guided by symptoms) are being increasingly
used in the management of malignant pleural effusions and in
theory represent a management option for patients with hepatic
hydrothorax who are unfit for specific hepatic intervention.
There are risks of precipitating hepato-renal syndrome but in
selected patients (largely with poorer-prognosis), these can be
employed relatively successfully.9
Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPSS) is war￾ranted in refractory hydrothorax and in patients who do not tol￾erate diuretics.10 TIPSS, acts to reduce portal hypertension
which drives formation of ascites. Studies have shown TIPSS to
be largely successful with reported response rates ranging
between 70% and 80% but usually act as a temporising measure
prior to liver transplantation.11 12
OUTCOME AND FOLLOW-UP
The patient was referred to a specialist hepatology unit to con￾sider TIPSS as a definitive treatment for hepatic hydrothorax.
As part of her workup, MRI of the liver raised the suspicion of
isolated HCC, and a contrast-enhanced CT. The first CT slice
(figure 2) is in arterial phase and demonstrates a 2.7 cm hyper￾vascular lesion with the second image (figure 3), PV phase,
shows that the lesion demonstrates washout. This is
characteristic of HCC in a cirrhotic liver. The right pleural effu￾sion is also demonstrated. Owing to her comorbidity, liver trans￾plantation was thought to be unsuitable. At the time of writing
she had been referred for transarterial chemoembolisation.
DISCUSSION
Hepatic hydrothorax has been defined as a pleural effusion,
typically more than 500 mL, in patients with liver cirrhosis
without coexisting cardiopulmonary disease.13 Although this
definition is not entirely satisfactory it highlights the require￾ment to exclude competing aetiologies for the effusion. It
occurs in 5–10% of end-stage cirrhotic liver disease patients.14
The exact mechanisms involved have not been well-defined.
However, it is thought that ascites that form as a consequence
of portal hypertension, crosses from the peritoneal to the
pleural cavity through small diaphragmatic defects (usually
<1 cm).15 The negative intrathoracic pressure favours the trans￾fer of fluid across the defects. In total, 85% of hepatic hydro￾thorax develops on the right, 13% left and 2% bilaterally.
It is thought that hydrothorax can occur in isolation owing to
the superior absorptive capacity of the peritoneum as compared
to the pleura. In this rare occurrence ascites production exceeds

the capacity of the pleura to resorb ascites generated but not
that of the peritoneum.16 Given that hepatic hydrothorax in the
absence of ascites is rare (but has been reported17); it follows
with the circumstances that the physiological parameters
required are specific as well as seldom coexist.
Learning points
▸ Hepatic hydrothorax is a rare complication in patients with
decompensated liver disease and may be the index
presentation for cirrhosis.
▸ Management is similar to that for ascites involving sodium
restriction, and diuretics.
▸ Chest drain insertion +/− pleurodesis may be necessitated
by clinical situation but recurrence is common.
▸ Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt is an efficacious
treatment modality for recurrent hepatic hydrothorax.
▸ Thorough assessment is required to identify and treat
underlying aetiology of chronic liver disease and cause for
decompensation.
