Research Article
Surgical treatment of emphysematous bullae: late outcome.
1. M G Pearson,
2. C Ogilvie
Abstract
From 1967 to 1972 12 patients were operated on for
emphysematous bullae in the Liverpool regional cardiothoracic
centre. The patient with the poorest lung function died in the
immediate postoperative period but the remainder survived for
more than five years. All but one of the survivors showed evidence
of benefit three to six months after surgery and all those not retired
returned to full-time employment for at least five years. Nine
patients were reviewed 5-10 years after surgery. These all reported
a gradual return of dyspnoea, which was matched by a falling one-


second forced expiratory volume (FEV1) (mean fall 82 ml a year);
but five were still maintaining some of their postoperative
improvement. When mean preoperative lung function values were
compared with the values obtained 5-10 years later there was still a
significant improvement in forced vital capacity; but FEV1, residual
volume, transfer coefficient, and arterial oxygen and carbon dioxide
tensions were unchanged. Chest radiographs showed no new bullae
or (except in one case) any increase in size of pre-existing bullae.
We conclude that the removal of large emphysematous bullae did
not hasten the progress of the underlying emphysema and that in
most patients some benefit lasted for more than five years after the
operation. Patients treated by lobectomy fared at least as well as
those treated by bullectomy alone. It may be relevant to the
relatively good progress of patients in this series that only three had
suffered from chronic bronchitis before operation or smoked after
operation, all but two had bullae occupying half or more of one
hemithorax, and none had hypercapnia.
