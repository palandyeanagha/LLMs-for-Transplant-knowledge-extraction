Abstract
Background: Biliary atresia (BA) is the most severe hepatic disorder in newborns and its
etiopathogenesis remains unknown. Viral involvement has been proposed, including the human
cytomegalovirus (HCMV). The aims of the study were to use the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
to screen the liver tissue of infants with extrahepatic cholestasis for HCMV and to correlate the
results with serological antibodies against HCMV and histological findings.
Methods: A retrospective study in a tertiary care setting included 35 patients (31 BA, 1 BA
associated with a choledochal cyst, 2 congenital stenosis of the distal common bile duct and 1
hepatic cyst). HCMV serology was determined by ELISA. Liver and porta hepatis were examined
histologically. Liver samples from infants and a control group were screened for HCMV DNA.
Results: Twelve patients had HCMV negative serology, 9 were positive for IgG antibodies and 14
were positive for IgG and IgM. Nine liver and seven porta hepatis samples were positive for HCMV
DNA but none of the control group were positive (general frequency of positivity was 34.3% – 12/
35). There was no correlation between HCMV positivity by PCR and the histological findings. The
accuracy of serology for detecting HCMV antibodies was low.
Conclusion: These results indicate an elevated frequency of HCMV in pediatric patients with
extrahepatic neonatal cholestasis. They also show the low accuracy of serological tests for
detecting active HCMV infection and the lack of correlation between HCMV positivity by PCR and
the histopathological changes.
Background
The most common cause of extrahepatic neonatal
cholestasis is biliary atresia (BA). BA is an obstructive
cholangiopathy and the end result of a destructive inflam￾matory process that affects the biliary ductal system. This
disease is more common in girls and involves 0.8–1/
10000 live births [1]. The etiology of BA remains
unknown but viral infections have been implicated with
several viruses studied [2-12], including human cytomeg￾Published: 01 December 2005

alovirus (HCMV) [13-17]. The etiology of the other causes
of extrahepatic neonatal cholestasis remains unknown.
HCMV is a slow replicating virus that belongs to the her￾pesvirus family (betaherpesvirus subfamily). Congenital
infection by HCMV occurs in approximately 1% of all
neonates. Of this 1%, only 5–10% have a typical cytome￾galic inclusion disease with hepatosplenomegaly, jaun￾dice and petechias. Another 10% will have a subclinical
congenital infection [18], and the remaining 80–85% will
be asymptomatic. Virus detection in the urine, saliva or
tissues of neonates during the first three weeks of life
defines congenital infection [19]. In contrast to infections
such as rubella and congenital toxoplasmosis, maternal
immunity against HCMV does not always provide ade￾quate protection against intrauterine transmission [19].
Hepatic involvement is frequent and clinical evidence of
hepatitis is occasionally found [20-22].
Perinatal infection is diagnosed in children who do not
eliminate the virus in urine at birth but who begin to show
the virus between the 4th and 12th week of life. The infec￾tion results from viral transmission during delivery,
through maternal milk or by blood transfusions, the first
two of these being the most important. The vast majority
of infants remain asymptomatic [19].
The purpose of this study was to screen the liver tissue of
infants with extrahepatic neonatal cholestasis for the pres￾ence of HCMV using PCR, and to correlate the results with
the HCMV serologies (ELISA systems) and histopatholog￾ical findings in these patients.
Methods
Thirty-five patients (13 males and 22 females) with extra￾hepatic neonatal cholestasis were evaluated upon admis￾sion to the Pediatric Gastroenterology Service of the
university hospital at UNICAMP, from September 1992 to
July 2000. The median infant age at the time of the first
visit was 82.5 days (range 25–239 days). Neonatal
cholestasis was secondary to BA in 31 infants and BA was
associated with a choledochal cyst in one, to distal
choledochal stenosis in two, and to hepatic cyst (measur￾ing 3.2 × 3.4 cm, close to the porta hepatis, compressing
the biliary tree and leading to obstructive cholestasis) in
one.
The diagnosis of BA was confirmed by intraoperative
cholangiogram. The diagnosis of choledochal cyst was
made by ultrasound and the distal choledochal stenosis
was diagnosed by intraoperative cholangiogram.
Liver tissue samples of nine infants were included as con￾trols and had presented the following diagnoses: 1 had
drug-related hepatotoxicity, 2 had alpha-1-antitrypsin
deficiency, 2 had galactosemia, 1 had cystic fibrosis, 1 had
congenital hepatic fibrosis, 1 had hepatoblastoma and 1
had a metabolic disease of undefined cause. The median
infant age was 46 days (range 28–180 days).

Serological investigation
The patients were divided into three groups, based on the
CMV serology results (by ELISA commercial system:
SORIN BIOMEDICA, Italy): 1) ELISA IgG-/IgM-; 2). ELISA
IgG+/IgM-, and 3) ELISA IgG+/IgM+. IgM antibodies were
detected by ELISA-capture assay.
Histological Analysis
All histological analyses were done by the same patholo￾gist. Fifty three samples (33 liver tissues and 20 porta
hepatis fragments) were evaluated by PCR. Of the 33 liver
tissues evaluated, 10 were collected by percutaneous biop￾sies, while the others were surgical biopsies. The following
characteristics were evaluated: portal fibrosis (0 = absent,
1 = slight, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe), septa (0 = absent, 1
= mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe), nodules (P = present, A
= absent), cholestasis and cholangitis (0 = absent, 1 =
mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe), giant cell transformation
(P = present, A = absent), eosinophils (P = present, A =
absent), myeloid metaplasia (P = present, A = absent),
siderosis (0 = absent, I = degree I, II = degree II, III = degree
III), cytomegalic inclusion (P = present, A = absent),
microabscesses (P = present, A = absent), ductal prolifera￾tion (0 = absent, 1 = slight, 2 = moderate, 3 = intense),
porta hepatis (normal, chronic inflammatory process
with predominance of lymphomononuclear cells or
chronically active with predominance of polymorphonu￾clear neutrophils or macrophages) and inflammatory
process of the porta hepatis (1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 =
severe).
DNA extraction/amplification
DNA was extracted from fresh material (4 patients)
according to Rogers et al. [23] and from formalin-fixed
paraffin-embbeded fragments by phenol-chloroform pro￾cedure described by Latchman [24]. PCR conditions for
HCMV and β-globin were the same. Five sections of 10
µm thick were obtained for DNA amplification [25]. The
human β-globin gene was amplified according SAIKI et al.
[26]. HCMV was detected by PCR and nested-PCR,
according Saiki et al. [26], Shibata et al. [27] and Demmler
et al. [28].
The amplifications were done in a DNA thermocycler
(Robocycler 40 – Stratagene) using 35 cycles of 94°C for
45 s, 55°C for 45 s and 72°C for 1 min. The cycles were
preceded by an initial denaturation at 94°C for 5 min and
were followed by a final extension for 7 min at 72°C. The
primers for the human β-globin gene were: PCO3+ (5'
CCTCTGACACAACTGTGTTCACTAGC 3') and PCO4+ (5'
TCACCACCAACTTCATCCACGTTCACC 3'). The primers
for HCMV DNA were: MIE4 (CCA AGC GGC CTC TGA
TAA CCA AGC C), MIE5 (CAG CAC CAT CCT CCT CTT
CCT CTG G), IE1 (CCA CCC GTG GTG CCA GCT CC) and
IE2 (CCC GCT CCT CCT GAG CAC CC). The MIE4 and
MIE5 primers were used for the first reaction (PCR) and
IE1 and IE2 for the nested-PCR.
The reaction mixture consisted of 0.5 – 1.0 µl of DNA in a
total volume of 20 µl containing 50 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris
(pH 8.4), 3 mM MgCl, 0.1 mM of each primer, 200 mM

of each deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate (dATP, dGTP,
dCTP, dTTP) and 2–4 units Taq polymerase. Water was
used to complete the total reaction volume. The mixture
was covered with a drop of mineral oil.
The reaction products were separeted by electrophoresis
in 2% agarose gels, stained with ethidium bromide and
visualized under ultraviolet light. For each CMV reaction,
fibroblast fluid containing strain AD 169 was used as a
positive control and the reaction mixture without the
strain was used as a negative control. Recommended pro￾cedures were used to avoid contamination [23].
The statistical analysis consisted of a descriptive analysis
with a frequency table, Fisher's exact test, the Kappa coef￾ficient and accuracy measurements. The significance level
was set at 5%. This study was approved by the ethics com￾mittee of the Faculty of Medical Sciences, UNICAMP, and
all infant's parents provided their informed consent prior
to enrolling in the study.
Results
Active HCMV infection was defined if one or both of the
following conditions are present: positive result for
HCMV DNA by PCR and a positive test for IgM HCMV
antibodies.
Twelve patients had HCMV negative serology (group I), 9
were positive for IgG antibodies (group II) and 14 were
positive for IgG and IgM (group III). In group I, 11
patients had BA (associated with a situs inversus in one
patient) and one patient had a distal choledochal steno￾sis. All of the patients in group II had BA and in group III,
12 children had BA (associated with a choledochal cyst in
one of them), one had a distal choledochal stenosis and
another had a hepatic cyst. The general characteristics of
the patients are show in Table 1. All were full term
neonates. The median time between HCMV serology and
liver biopsy was 8 days.
Of 33 liver samples screened by PCR, 9 (27.3%) were pos￾itive for HCMV DNA and 7 out of 20 (35%) porta hepatis
fragments were positive (figure 1). There was adequate
agreement between these results (Kappa coefficient =
0.51), albeit some divergences. Two patients had HCMV
DNA in the liver but not in porta hepatic. Three children
were positive for HCMV DNA in the porta hepatis but neg￾ative for HCMV in the liver tissue. The overall frequency

of HCMV DNA was 34.3% (12/35) based on a positive
result in one of the two tissue samples. Based on the PCR
distribution among the groups there were three positive
patients in group I, three in group II and six in group III.
The histological characteristics of HCMV positive patients
are show in Table 2 and of HCMV negative patients in
Table 3. The pathologist did not observe the presence of
cytomegalic cells in any case. No significant correlation
was observed between any of the findings.
Compared to PCR, serology had a low accuracy (59%) to
detect active HCMV infection, with 54% sensitivity and
61% specificity. The patients' specimens from the control
group had no HCMV DNA detected by PCR analysis. The
table 4 shows the results of serology and PCR in all
patients.
Discussion
Progress has been made in the diagnosis, treatment and
prognosis of BA and other causes of extrahepatic cholesta￾sis. The etiopathogenic origin of the disease still remains
unknown, although viral involvement has been sug￾gested. Based on several diagnostic methods, including
PCR, cytomegalovirus has been found in association with
BA [13,14,16,17]. However, other studies have found no
such correlation [12,15]. Of the other causes of obstruc￾tive neonatal cholestasis, only choledochal cysts have
been associated with viral infections.
Sokol et al. [10] found no positivity for reovirus type 3 (29
patients with BA, 1 with a choledochal cyst) and Tyler et
al. [15] found positivity in 7 of 9 children with choledo￾chal cysts. Our study is the first to investigate the ocur￾rence of HCMV in other causes of extrahepatic neonatal

cholestasis. HCMV DNA was found in patients with a
hepatic cyst and a distal choledochal stenosis.
Serological screening revealed a seroprevalence of HCMV
infection of 65.7% [23/35]. Previous studies made in Bra￾zil have evaluated the incidence of congenital infection
and prevalence of antibodies in mothers. Pannuti et al.
[29] showed a prevalence of HCMV antibodies in mothers
of 84.4% and the incidence of congenital infection was
0.98% in the low socioeconomic population. In the mid￾dle socioeconomic cohort, the maternal prevalence and
incidence of congenital infections were 66.5% and 0.39%,
respectively [29]. Yamamoto et al. [30] showed a preva￾lence of congenital infection of 2.6% with maternal sero￾positivity of 95%. On the other hand, the acquisition risk
of perinatal infection was 30.9% [31]. Unfortunately, we
don't have data regarding the serologic pattern of our
patient's mothers since this test is not part of our institu￾tion's routine clinical practice.
The accuracy of serology to detected active HCMV infec￾tion compared with PCR in this study was low. The corre￾lation between serology and PCR results suggests the need
for caution in concluding, based on positive serology, that
HCMV is responsible for the observed cholestasis. When
the 14 patients with positive IgM serology were analyzed
by PCR in biopsies, only 6 were positive. Thus, although
8 patients had an active HCMV infection detected by
serology, the cholestasis was not secondary to this infec￾tion and its cause requires further investigation.
In several cases, a positive serology delayed referral of the
patient to our service since they were considered to have
hepatitis secondary to viral infection. This is important
since most pediatricians begin the investigation of
cholestasis by determining that infectious agents are
involved, and suspend further analysis when a positive
serology is found. Another factor to be considered in
patients with positive IgM serology and negative PCR is
the possibility of a false-positive result for IgM. False-pos￾itives can be secondary to the presence of rheumatoid fac￾tor (IgM of the neonate against maternal IgG), or to cross￾reaction with other herpesviruses [22]. Until the screening
of IgM antibody is improved, physicians should use more
than one method in their diagnosis [22].
Of the 9 IgG+/IgM- patients, 3 were positive for HCMV
DNA. The presence of IgG may represent the transplacen￾tal passage of maternal IgG (the infant being infected or
not). With such a serological profile, the physician should
be concerned not only with completing the investigation,
but also with repeating the serology because of the possi￾bility of IgM appearing in a subsequent collection, espe￾cially when the infant is infected. Another possibility
would be to measure IgG levels as well, since they remain
high in congenital or perinatal infection [32]. In patients
with a positive PCR, the absence of IgM antibodies could
represent a false-negative result. False-negative results may
be secondary to the competition between the high levels
of maternal IgG antibodies and the relatively low levels of
fetal IgM [22]. In the post-natal period, when facing an
antigenic stimulus, IgM levels rise rapidly during the first
month of life and increase gradually. At around one year
of age, these values reach approximately 60% of the adult
levels [33].
Of the 12 ELISA-negative patients, 3 were positive by PCR.
Sample contamination cannot be excluded, despite the
low probability of this occurring in view of the care taken
during extraction and PCR, including the use of nested
PCR.
There was good agreement between liver and porta hepa￾tis tissues when analysed separately. However, two
patients with HCMV DNA in liver tissue were negative in
the porta hepatis. In both, the band representing β-globin
DNA in the porta hepatis fragment was considered weakly
positive, while the corresponding hepatic band was con￾sidered strongly positive. This may indicate a false-nega￾tive result, judging by the sample DNA quality. Two
patients were positive for HCMV DNA in the porta hepatis
and negative in the liver. They had a positive serology
(IgG+/IgM+) and very intense β-globin band. Since the
HCMV was not genotyped, we cannot exclude the possi￾bility of the existence of strains with different affinity for
ducts or hepatocytes, and of strains with differences in
their virulence. Further studies are needed to clarify this
question.
In the absence of in situ hybridization it is unclear whether
the detected HCMV was within the hepatocytes and/or
biliary duct cells, or whether it was simply circulating in
the plasma or in leucocytes.
In this study the pathologist did not observed the presence
of cytomegalic cells or microabscess in any case. Similar
results have been reported by others [9,14,16].
The 34.3% positivity for HCMV DNA found in infants
with extrahepatic cholestasis contrast with the lack of pos￾itivity in any of the controls. These findings, and those of
Fischler et al. [13] and Domiati-Saad et al. [11], indicate
that cytomegalovirus may be involved in the etiopatho￾genesis of BA. This hypothesis could be tested with an
experimental model of BA induced by HCMV in animals
using the methodology described by Petersen et al. [34].
In contrast, Chang et al. [9] and Jevon et al. [14] found no
HCMV involvement in the etiopathogenesis of BA. In the
study by Jevon et al. [14], no HCMV was found in 12

infants with BA. A probable explanation for this finding
could be the low prevalence of the infection in a Canadian
population, which would not exclude viral participation
in cholestasis. Chang et al. [9] examined the occurrence of
HCMV in 50 infants with neonatal hepatitis (26 with BA)
and 30 controls, and found positivity in two cases with
BA, in 23 with hepatitis, but in none of the controls. A
possible explanation for this finding could be the strain of
virus involved.
The hypothesis that biliary epithelial cells function as
antigen presenters was considered. In normal liver, MHC
(major histocompatibility complex) class I antigens are
expressed on the sinusoidal cells, large vessel and sinusoi￾dal endothelium, biliary epithelium, and dendritic cells.
Class II antigens are found only on the sinusoidal cells,
capillary endothelium and dendritic cells. The ductal epi￾thelium of BA patients has an aberrant expression of class
II antigens [35]. Recently, specific morphological altera￾tions in the biliary ducts has been described [36,37].
Injury to the epithelium secondary to an immune modu￾lated response may be triggered by a viral infection.
If a viral infection contributes to this injury, then antiviral
therapy in the infants with HCMV infection can be con￾sidered as a possible intervention and consequently may
improve outcomes. Further controlled randomized stud￾ies are needed to clarify this aspect.
Conclusion
In conclusion, the frequency of HCMV detected by PCR
was high (34.3%). The accuracy of serology for detecting
active HCMV infection was low compared to PCR, and
there was no correlation between the presence of HCMV
and the typical histopathological alterations (microab￾scess and cytomegalic cells) or the inflammatory process
in porta hepatis in our patients.
