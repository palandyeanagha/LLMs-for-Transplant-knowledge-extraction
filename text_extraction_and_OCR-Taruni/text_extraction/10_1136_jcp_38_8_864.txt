SUMMARY Acquired polycystic disease with concurrent development of renal cell tumours is a
well documented complication of long term haemodialysis. We present a case of acquired
polycystic disease with renal cell tumours and multifocal urothelial tumours. Only two similar
cases have been recorded.
Patients receiving long term haemodialysis some￾times develop multiple renal cysts, which can simu￾late an adult type of congenital polycystic disease.
Dunnill etal coined the term "acquired cystic dis￾ease of the kidneys" for this condition.' In some
cases it is further complicated by the development of
renal adenomas or carcinomas, or both. We report a
case of acquired polycystic disease with associated
renal cell tumours and multifocal caliceal, ureteric,
and vesical transitional cell carcinomas. This is the
third recorded case of urothelial neoplasia associ￾ated with acquired polycystic disease.
Patients and methods
CASE REPORT
The patient was a 56 year old white man who in
1963, at the age of 35, developed an acute nephritic
illness. He was treated symptomatically, and no
renal biopsy was performed. Subsequently, he
developed pronounced proteinuria with hyperten￾sion; his renal function deteriorated over the next
six years and chronic renal failure ensued. In 1972
regular intermittent haemodialysis was started. In
1978 a parathyroidectomy was performed to allevi￾ate severe secondary hyperparathyroidism. He was
given a renal allograft into the left iliac fossa in
1979, but within a few weeks the transplanted kid￾ney had to be removed.
In 1983 he was readmitted for investigation of a
two month history of haematuria. Cystoscopy
showed a small papillary tumour on the left post￾erolateral wall of the urinary bladder, which was
resected; histological examination showed a grade I
non-invasive papillary transitional cell carcinoma.
His haematuria persisted, and he complained of pain

in the right lower abdomen. Right retrograde
ureteropylography and a brush biopsy of the right
ureter were carried out, and the brush biopsy
s;'owed a papillary transitional cell carcinoma
(grade II). In 1984 he underwent a right neph￾roureterectomy.
Results
MACROSCOPIC APPEARANCE
The nephrectomy specimen weighed 209 g and
measured 11 x 7 x 5 cm. The attached ureter was
25 cm long. The external and cut surfaces of the
kidney showed numerous thin walled cysts (0.2-
2 5 cm in diameter) throughout the cortex and
medulla (Fig. 1). The appearance of the specimen
was reminiscent of an adult type of congenital
polycystic kidney, though the kidney was not greatly
enlarged. Some of the cysts contained haemorrhagic
fluid and chocolate coloured blood clots. Pro￾nounced destruction of the renal parenchyma with
compensatory hyperplasia of peripelvic fatty tissue
was visible. The pelvicaliceal system seemed to be
dilated. Three small grey-white nodules like plaque
(0-2-0.5 cm in diameter) were present within the
cystic spaces. The ureter contained two friable
nodules, each about 1-5 cm in diameter, which par￾tially occluded the lumen. These nodules were
7-5 cm and 10-0 cm from the pelviureteric junction.
MICROSCOPIC FEATURES
The cysts seemed to comprise dilated tubules and
were lined by single layers of cuboidal to columnar
epithelium. In a few the internal epithelium showed
cellular atypia (Fig. 2). The intervening renal tissue
comprised atrophic tubules, fibrous tissue, thick
walled blood vessels, and a few mononuclear

inflammatory cells. Abundant crystals of oxalate and
foci of calcification were present. No glomeruli were
seen. Many cysts contained haemorrhagic fluid, and
a few showed papillary microadenomas.
The largest tumour, which was visible
macroscopically, was composed of rather uniform
cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm, vesicu￾lar nuclei, and small but conspicuous nucleoli. The
cells were mostly arranged in tubules and
trabeculae. but a few papillary formations were also
noted (Fig. 3). A large amount of iron was present
within the epithelial cells and was presumably due to
old intracystic haemorrhage. No mitotic activity was
seen. It was impossible to assess the malignant
potential of this tumour. The two other nodules
similar to plaque were grade II transitional cell car￾cinomas arising from the calices (Fig. 4). The
ureteric tumours were also urothelial carcinomas of
a similar grade. No invasion of the muscle wall had
occurred.
Discussion
Acquired polycystic disease is a well documented
complication of long term intermittent hae￾modialysis.'-4 One case has also been reported in
a patient with chronic renal failure who developed
acquired polycystic disease with renal cell carcinoma
before he started maintenance haemodialysis.2 The

pathogenesis may be an exaggerated form of
retention cyst formation, a condition often seen in
contracted, granular, and scarred kidneys. An
increased incidence of both extrarenal and renal
neoplasia has been reported in patients with chronic
renal failure.6 Immune suppression and accumula￾tion of toxic metabolites with carcinogenic potential
have been implicated in the pathogenesis, though
this has not been proved. The exact relation be￾tween the formation of cysts a,nd neoplasia of renal
cells is also poorly understood, and opinion is
divided on this issue.3 All the reports on acquired
polycystic disease do suggest, however, that an
increased incidence of renal tumours (adenoma,
oncocytoma, and adenocarcinoma) is associated
with this condition.
In Dunnill et al's series of 14 cases of acquired
polycystic disease six patients had associated renal
cell tumours, of which one was malignant.' Hughson
et al examined 66 end stage renal failure kidneys
from patients receiving dialysis to analyse the inci￾dence of atypical cysts, acquired polycystic disease,
and renal cell adenomata.3 They recorded five cases
of acquired polycystic disease and 20 cases of forma￾tion of atypical cysts in which multiple, microscopic,
or barely macroscopic cysts were present in the cor￾tex (the cysts were lined by cytologically atypical
proliferative epithelium). There was also a
significant increase in the incidence of adenomas in
those patients with cysts. They therefore concluded
that ' the stimulus for neoplastic growth accom￾panies a cystic transformation of kidneys." Interest￾ingly, we also observed pronounced cellular atypism
in a few cystically dilated tubules, and, presumably,
this lesion is the precursor to renal cell tumours.
Brendler et al recently described three more cases of
acquired polycystic disease; in two patients
oncocytomas and renal cell carcinomas were found.5
The tirst case of urothelial tumour associated with
acquired polycystic disease was documented by
Chung-Park et al.2 A multifocal, well differentiated,
invasive transitional cell carcinoma was seen to be
growing out of the cysts, and similar tumours were
also present in the renal pelvis and in the ureteric
stump. Seven months later the patient developed a
diffuse transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary
bladder. The ureters, prostate, and seminal vesicles
were also affected. This patient had no history of
exposure to exogenous urothelial carcinogens. Boon
and Michael recorded a second case of acquired
polycystic disease with pelvic and vesical transitional
cell carcinoma4; this patient's renal failure was due
to analgesic abuse, which is also an aetiological fac￾tor in urothelial neoplasia.8 The patients in both of
these reports had renal cell tumours.

cinoma seemed to originate from the deformed
calices, and similar tumours were also present in the
attached ureter. Several microadenomas and one
larger renal cell tumour of uncertain malignant
potential were also seen. The patient denied having
been exposed to aniline dyes or having taken exces￾sive analgesics, both of which are aetiological factors
in urothelial cancers.
The slowly increasing number of cases of urothel￾ial cell tumours in acquired polycystic disease with
coincidental renal cell tumours suggests that the
association is not entirely fortuitous and that a
common tumourogenic factor may have a role in the
pathogenesis. The clinical implications of acquired
polycystic disease have been emphasised in previous
reports, but the additional complication of urothelial
tumours exacerbates the problem. We therefore
suggest that all patients receiving long term mainte￾nance haemodialysis should be carefully followed up
by cytological examination of urine at regular inter￾vals; in suspected cases further clinical and radio￾logical investigations are mandatory.
