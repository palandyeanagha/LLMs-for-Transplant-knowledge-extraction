Abstract
Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a potent metabolic regulator, and pharmacological administration elicits glucose and
lipid lowering responses in mammals. To delineate if adipose tissue is the predominant organ responsible for anti-diabetic
effects of FGF21, we treated mice with reduced body fat (lipodystrophy mice with adipose specific expression of active
sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c; Tg) with recombinant murine FGF21 (rmuFGF21). Unlike wildtype (WT) mice,
Tg mice were refractory to the beneficial effects of rmuFGF21 on body weight, adipose mass, plasma insulin and glucose
tolerance. To determine if adipose mass was critical for these effects, we transplanted WT white adipose tissue (WAT) into Tg
mice and treated the mice with rmuFGF21. After transplantation, FGF21 responsiveness was completely restored in WAT
transplanted Tg mice compared to sham Tg mice. Further, leptin treatment alone was sufficient to restore the anti-diabetic
effects of rmuFGF21 in Tg mice. Molecular analyses of Tg mice revealed normal adipose expression of Fgfr1, Klb and an 8-
fold over-expression of Fgf21. Impaired FGF21-induced signaling indicated that residual adipose tissue of Tg mice was
resistant to FGF21, whilst normal FGF21 signaling was observed in Tg livers. Together these data suggest that adipose tissue
is required for the triglyceride and glucose, but not the cholesterol lowering efficacy of FGF21, and that leptin and FGF21
exert additive anti-diabetic effects in Tg mice.

Introduction
Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) regulates energy homeostasis
in mammals [1,2]. It is expressed predominantly in liver, white and
brown adipose tissues (WAT & BAT) and pancreas [3]. In response
to fasting or a ketogenic diet, FGF21 expression is induced primarily
in the liver through the action of PPARa [4,5]. Pharmacologically,
FGF21 has become recognized as a modulator of glucose and lipid
homeostasis in vivo [1,6]. Recombinant FGF21 therapy corrected
many metabolic perturbations in diseased rodent models and non￾human primates [1,6,7]. In these different models, FGF21 reduced
body weight, plasma and hepatic cholesterol and triglycerides levels,
and increased oxygen consumption [1,6]. Additionally, FGF21
improved the diabetic phenotypes of these animals by decreasing
hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, glucose intolerance, and increas￾ing peripheral and hepatic insulin sensitivity [7]. Generation of
FGF21 null mice confirmed the essential role of FGF21 in metabolic
physiology [8,9]. Mild obesity and adipocyte hypertrophy were
observed in KO mice, indicating a crucial function for FGF21 in
adipose tissue biology [8,9].
FGF21 binds fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) tyrosine
kinases complexed with the co-receptor b-klotho [10,11] and
activates MAPK preferentially via FGFR1c/b-klotho [12]. It is
reported that the restricted gene expression profile of b-klotho in
liver, WAT and pancreas confers tissue specificity for the
metabolic activity of FGF21 [13,14]. Indeed, FGF21 rapidly
induces FGFR and MAPK activation in liver and WAT tissues
[15], suggesting that both tissues are FGF21 target organs. FGF21
was initially identified as a stimulator of glucose uptake in mouse
3T3-L1 adipocytes [1] suggesting a prominent role in adipose
tissue, and participation in regulation of glucose metabolism in this
tissue. Additionally, FGF21 is involved in the regulation of
adipocyte lipolysis [5,16,17]. The liver may also participate in the
glucose- and lipid-lowering effect of FGF21 since FGF21
suppresses hepatic glucose output and inhibits hepatic lipogenesis
and triglyceride formation [6,15]. Although, both liver and
adipose tissue may participate in the pharmacological action of
FGF21, the degree and nature of their contributions may differ.
FGF21 has a 10-fold higher affinity to induce ERK-phosphory￾lation in adipose tissue than in liver, suggesting that FGF21 may
preferentially target adipose tissue [15]. In addition, we observed
that FGF21 acutely reduces blood glucose and insulin levels while
it had no effect on cholesterol or triglyceride levels [15], thus
FGF21 may induce separable responses on glucose and lipid
homeostasis. The fact that FGF21 improves adiposity, lipid and
glucose metabolism in a tissue-restricted manner and increases
glucose uptake acutely in adipose tissues [15] prompted us to test
whether the b-klotho expressing tissue, WAT, was necessary for
FGF21 to elicit efficacy. [15].

Herein, we assess the pharmacological effects of recombinant
murine FGF21 (rmuFGF21) in a mouse model with severely
depleted adipose tissue levels. We generated lipodystrophy mice to
replicate previously published aP2-nSREBP1c mice [18] and
investigated the anti-diabetic and hypolipidemic efficacy of
rmuFGF21. We found that apart from plasma cholesterol levels,
rmuFGF21 was ineffective at improving glucose and lipid homeo￾stasis in lipodystrophy mice. Further, adipose transplantation and
leptin treatment restored FGF21 responsiveness in these mice.
Methods
Transgenesis
Lipodystrophy mice were generated at Amgen Inc. by cloning
the mature human SREBP1c (residues 1–436) downstream of the
mouse adipocyte fatty acid binding protein aP2 promoter. Briefly,
a 1450 b.p. cDNA encompassing human SREBP1c was cloned
into a transgenic vector containing the mouse 5.4 Kb aP2
promoter/enhancer genomic fragment and the SV40 small T
intron and polyadenylation signal. The transgene was excised with
Sph2 and Swa1 and purified for microinjection into FVB zygotes.
Following confirmation of transgene overexpression by northern
blot (Figure S1A), transgenic mice (Tg) were housed and bred at
Charles River Laboratories (San Diego, CA), and maintained by
continued backcrossing of Tg males to FVB females.
Animal Procedures
Ethics Statement. All animal studies were approved by the
Amgen Inc. Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee under
protocol number 2006–00010.
Blood samples were collected from retro-orbital sinus of
conscious mice, and used to determine blood glucose levels
(OneTouch Basic glucometer or AlphaTRAK monitor as indicat￾ed). Plasma was collected in EDTA tubes. Body composition was
determined using the EchoMRI apparatus. Glucose tolerance tests
(GTT) were conducted in 12-hour fasted mice following IP
injection of 2 g/kg glucose. Plasma cholesterol, triglycerides, and
NEFA levels were measured using the Olympus AU400e
Chemistry Analyzer (Olympus America, Inc; Center Valley, PA).
Insulin and adiponectin values were determined by ELISA
(Crystalchem and Millipore respectively). Plasma FGF21 levels
were measured using an in-house ELISA [15]. Recombinant
murine/human FGF21 and murine leptin were generated as
previously described [15,19].
Animal Study Design I–effects of Chronic rmuFGF21
Plasma was collected from fed WT and Tg 10-week old male
mice, based on glucose values, mice were separated into 3 groups
(N = 8) per genotype such that the average intra-genotype blood
glucose levels were similar. Each group was intraperitoneally (IP)
injected with 1 or 10 mg/kg body weight/day rmuFGF21 or
vehicle bis in die (BID) for 21 days at which point the mice were
necropsied. Body composition was determined on treatments days
0, 7, and 14. A second fed plasma sample was collected after 14
days of treatment and GTTs were performed after 18 days of
treatment (both 1 hour after dosing). At necropsy (day 21), liver,
WAT (epididymal and inguinal) and BAT were excised, weighed
and flash frozen for further analysis.
Animal Study Design II–signaling Effects of rhuFGF21
WT and Tg mice 16–18 wks old were separated into vehicle
and rhuFGF21 treatment groups (N = 5/group). Mice were
administered a single IP injection of vehicle or 1 mg/kg body
weight rhuFGF21 and were necropsied 15 minutes later. At
necropsy, liver, and WAT (epididymal) were frozen in liquid
nitrogen.
Animal Study Design III–effects of Adipose
Transplantation and rmuFGF21
Plasma was collected from a cohort of fed 14 WT and 28 Tg
15–16 week old male mice. Half of the Tg and all WT mice were
sham operated, the remaining Tg groups underwent WT adipose
transplantation. Donor WT animals were siblings to recipient Tg
males, and sufficient WT epididymal adipose tissue was obtained
from a single donor to increase Tg adipose mass by approximately
2 g (maximal amount for successful graft as determined in pilot
studies). The adipose tissue was divided into 10 sections of
approximately 200 mg each. Two small incisions were made along
the ventral midline, and one incision was made on the dorsal side
of each recipient. After implant placement, the incisions were
closed with surgical glue. Fourteen days post surgery plasma was
collected from all animals; the 14 WT mice were randomized into
2 groups such that the average blood glucose and adipose mass
levels were similar. This randomization was also done for the Tg
sham and Tg transplant groups of mice. Each group was treated
with 10 mg/kg body weight/day rmuFGF21 or vehicle BID for 21
days at which point the mice were necropsied following
decapitation. Body composition was determined before, immedi￾ately following, and 7, 14, 21 and 28 days after surgery. Fed
plasma samples were collected pre-transplant, post-transplant pre￾treatment and post-treatment (14th day of treatment), and GTTs
were performed on the 18th day of treatment (both 1 hour after
dosing). At necropsy, liver, WAT (epididymal, inguinal, and
implants) and BAT were excised, weighed and fixed in 10%
neutral buffered zinc-formalin, paraffin-embedded, H&E stained
and examined by light microscopy.
Animal Study Design IV–effects of rmuFGF21 and
Rmuleptin
Plasma was collected from a cohort of fed Tg 11–16 week old
male mice, based on blood glucose values, mice were grouped into
4 groups (N = 6) per genotype such that the average blood glucose
levels were similar. Each group was treated with either 10 mg/kg
body weight/day of rmuFGF21, muleptin, both or vehicle BID for
15 days. GTTs were performed on the 11th day of treatment (1
hour after dosing). A second fed plasma sample was collected after
15 days of treatment prior to necropsy.
Molecular Analyses
RNA was prepared from inguinal fat using the Qiagen RNeasy
Mini Kit. Purified RNA was analyzed with the Qiagen RT-PCR
Multiplexing system on an ABI Prism 7900. Cyclophilin A was
used as the housekeeping gene (See Methods S1).
Tissue lysates were prepared in RIPA buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl
pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 1.0 mM EDTA, 1.0 mM EGTA, 10%
Glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 20 mM Na4P2O7, 1 mM PMSF,
2 mM NaVO3, 1 mM NaF, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate )
with protease (Complete EDTA-free, Roche), and phosphatase
inhibitors (PhosSTOP, Roche). Samples were resolved on a 4–
12% Bis-Tris gel and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes.
Proteins were detected using the following antibodies: anti-b￾klotho (0.1 mg/mL, R&D systems, AF2619), anti-phospho
ERK1/2 (1:1000, Cell Signaling, 9101), anti-ERK1/2 (1:1000,
Cell Signaling, 9102), anti-phospho FGFR1 (1:1000 Novus
Biologicals, NB110-62076), anti-FGFR1 (Abcam, ab10646),
anti-phospho FRS2-a (Cell Signaling, 3861), anti-FRS2 (1:200,
Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-8318), anti-phospho SHP2 (1:1000,

Cell Signaling, 3751), anti-SHP2 (1:1000, Cell Signaling, 3752),
and anti-b-actin (1:5000, Sigma-Aldrich, A2228). The bands
were visualized by chemiluminescence (Supersignal West Dura
substrate, Pierce).
Statistical Analysis
Data analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 5
(GraphPad Software). A one-way ANOVA was employed to
determine statistical significance and P-values were calculated
using a Dunnett’s or Tukey posthoc test. A two-tailed student’s T￾Test was used where indicated.
Results
Recombinant FGF21 Improves Glucose Homeostasis in
Wildtype Mice but not in Lipodystrophy Mice
To evaluate the role of adipose tissue in eliciting anti-diabetic
efficacy associated with FGF21 therapy, we generated mice with
diminished adipose mass. These mice were intended to replicate
those described by Brown and Goldstein [18], in which the mature
N-terminal domain of the human SREBP1c (nSREBP1c) was
overexpressed specifically in adipose tissues. Molecular character￾ization of the Tg mice (Figure S1A–B) demonstrated specific
transgene expression in adipose tissues. Gene expression analysis of
liver and adipose tissues (Figure S1C) showed multiple changes in
the expression of metabolic genes. In WAT and BAT Srebp1c, Ldlr
and Hmgcr were most upregulated by transgene overexpression,
whereas in the liver Pparg was upregulated. In all these tissues Fgf21
was upregulated between 10–25 fold. Leptin was the most
downregulated gene. The phenotype of these Tg mice when bred
on the FVB background was similar to that previously reported
[18]. We observed similar body weights to WT mice, but
dramatically decreased fat mass and commensurate increases in
lean mass (Figure S2A–C), in addition we observed hyperglycemia
(Figure S2D), and mild/sporadic glucose intolerance (Figure S2E–
F). Additionally, Tg mice were severely insulin resistant (Figure
S2G–H). Food intake was mildly increased in Tg mice compared to
WT mice (Figure S2I). Tg mice exhibited hepatomegaly, and
dramatically reduced WAT depot weights (Figure S2J). Triglycer￾ides levels were lower, with little change in cholesterol levels (Figure
S2K–L) in Tg mice. Taken together these mice present a similar
model of lipodystrophy to that produced by Shimomura et al [18].
In contrast to the former model of lipodystrophy, we observed
reduced triglycerides in Tg mice compared to WT mice. This could
possibly be related to the difference in genetic background of the
mice. Simomura et al. bred their mice on a B6/SJL background
whereas here we breed to FVB mice. We found that WT FVB levels
of plasma triglycerides are massively increased compared to WT
mice of the original lipodystrophy mice (,400 mg/dL vs. 74–
123 mg/dL (Figure S1K and [18]). Futhermore we found that WT
insulin levels are considerably higher than typical B6 values. It has
been reported [20] that severely different phenotypes can be
observed when the A-ZIP/F-1 transgene is bred onto B6 or FVB
backgrounds, and these differences likely account for the differ￾ences we observe in our Tg mice.
The effects of 1 and 10 mg/kg of rmuFGF21 were assessed in
WT and Tg mice. In WT mice, rmuFGF21 at 10 mg/kg reduced
body weight (Figure 1A) but this effect was marginal in Tg mice
(Figure 1B). Furthermore, rmuFGF21 reduced whole-body
adipose mass (Figure 1C) and epididymal/inguinal fat pad mass
(Figure S3A–B) in WT mice while no effects were observed in Tg
mice. Lean mass, BAT, and liver weights were unaffected by
rmuFGF21 in either WT or Tg mice (Figure 1D and Figure S3C–
D). Blood glucose levels were unchanged in both WT and Tg mice
following rmuFGF21 administration (Figure 1E), whereas
rmuFGF21 reduced insulin levels (Figure 1F) and improved
glucose tolerance in WT mice (Figures 1G and I). Despite the
hyperinsulinemia in Tg mice, rmuFGF21 was ineffective in
improving plasma insulin and glucose tolerance (Figures 1F, H–
I). A minimal improvement in glucose tolerance was observed in
Tg mice treated with 10 mg/kg rmuFGF21 (Figure 1H, 90 min.),
but area under the curve (AUC) analysis did not reach statistical
significance (Figure 1I).
Plasma lipids (cholesterol, triglycerides, and NEFAs) were all
reduced by both doses of rmuFGF21 in WT mice (Figures 1J–L).
Interestingly, only cholesterol levels were reduced by rmuFGF21
treatment in Tg mice, albeit to a lesser extent than in WT mice
(Figure 1J).
WAT Expression of FGF21 Receptor Complex in
Lipodystrophy Mice
A defective FGF21 receptor complex in adipose tissue of Tg
mice might lead to the lack of an improvement in parameters of
glucose homeostasis following rmuFGF21 treatment. To investi￾gate this possibility, we analyzed gene expression of Fgf21, Klb and
Fgfr1c in the adipose tissue of WT and Tg mice (Figure 2A).
Interestingly we found that Fgf21 was overexpressed approximate￾ly 9-fold in Tg vs. WT adipose (consistent with Figure S1C). This
was associated with a similar increase in circulating FGF21 levels
1.8660.31 ng/mL vs. 0.3160.04 ng/mL in Tg vs. WT, respec￾tively (P,0.01). As receptor downregulation could account for an
increase in Fgf21 expression, the expression of the Klb and Fgfr1c
components of the FGF21 receptor complex were also measured,
but we failed to detect a difference in their expression (Figure 2A),
however we had previously observed a small decrease in Fgfr1c in
WAT (consistent with Figure S1C). To rule-out any post￾translational downregulation of b-klotho, we performed immuno￾blot analyses and failed to find any differences in b-klotho protein
levels of Tg vs. WT mice (Figure 2B). Treatment with rmuFGF21
did not significantly alter the expression of these genes.
Defective FGF21 Signaling in Lipodystrophy WAT
To investigate the possibility that Tg adipose is somehow
defective and resistant to FGF21, a single injection of 1 mg/kg
recombinant human FGF21 (rhuFGF21) was administered in
naı¨ve WT and Tg mice, and FGF21-induced signaling was
investigated in WAT and liver tissues (Figure 3). We chose
rhuFGF21 as it is more potent than mouse FGF21, and
anticipated to yield clear signaling responses [15]. Immunoblot
analyses revealed expected ERK signaling in WT WAT with
rhuFGF21, but a diminished phospho-ERK response in Tg WAT
(Figure 3A). We further assessed the signaling of rhuFGF21 by
analyzing Fibroblast growth factor receptor substrate 2 (FRS2)
phosphorylation (Figure 3B). Injection of rhuFGF21 led to a clear
induction of FRS2 phosphorylation, apparent as a larger 85 and
smaller 75 kD band (due to multiple phosphorylation sites). In
unstimulated Tg WAT, we observed FRS2 phosphorylation with a
unique triple-banding pattern (approx. 80–85 kDa), which was
unchanged in response to rhuFGF21, suggesting basal activation
of the pathway, proximal to ERK activation. We next interrogated
the FRS2 adaptor Src homology domain 2 containing protein
tyrosine phosphatase (SHP2) (Figure 3C). In Tg WAT, SHP2 was
minimally phosphorylated when unstimulated and remained
unchanged in response to rhuFGF21. In liver, rhuFGF21 elicited
similar ERK phosphorylation in both WT and Tg animals
(Figure 3D).

Adipose Transplantation in Lipodystrophy Mice Restores
FGF21 Responsiveness
To determine if the FGF21’s anti-diabetic effects necessitate the
presence of adipose tissue, we reconstituted adipose mass by
implanting WAT from WT mice into Tg mice, and assessed the
efficacy of rmuFGF21 in these animals. In pilot experiments
(Figure S4) we determined that small (,100 mg) pieces of WAT
successfully grafted, and we could increase adipose mass by
Figure 1. Lipodystrophy mice are resistant to anti-diabetic effects of recombinant FGF21 treatment. Recombinant muFGF21 (1 or
10 mg/kg, pink and red symbols respectively) or vehicle (green symbols) was injected BID in wildtype (WT - open bars) and aP2-nSrebp1c
lipodystrophy (Tg - hatched bars) male mice as described in Animal Study Design I (Methodology). (A–B) Body weight was monitored daily. Dramatic
drop in body weight on day 17 was caused by the 12 h fast for GTT. (C–D) Adipose and lean mass was recorded in WT and Tg mice at 0, 7 and 14 days

approximately 2 g (Figure S4A). We found that although the MRI
apparatus detected the WAT following transplant, it was
ineffective at monitoring the WAT transplants over time (.2–3
weeks, possibly caused by delipidation of WAT or additional
cellular infiltrate) despite the fact that upon necropsy the fat pads
were still intact and approximately the same size as their pre￾implantation size. Nonetheless we considered the transplantation
methodology successful due to the fact that leptin levels increased
(Figure S4B), glucose and insulin levels had normalized (Figure
S4C–D), and the steatosis in Tg mice had been reversed (Figure
S4E vs. S4F). We observed that every transplanted fat pad was
viable and had low grade inflammatory cell infiltrate (Figure S4G).
Based on these data we investigated whether WAT transplantation
could restore FGF21 efficacy. Immediately following implantation
or sham surgery, the group average fat mass was increased from
1.4 g to 3.2 g in Tg transplanted (Tg–tx) mice (Figure 4A). At the
completion of the study we measured leptin and found minimal
increases in the Tg transplant mice in contrast to our pilot data
(Figure S4B) and suspect that this may be related to differences in
the 2 study designs; the pilot mice were implanted and allowed to
fully heal, whereas the mice in this study were implanted, handled
twice daily and tested for 2 weeks following transplantation.
Nonetheless the transplantation methodology was successful in this
study for several reasons, namely, plasma glucose, NEFAs, plasma
FGF21 and liver weights were all lower in Tg–tx mice compared
to Tg-sham mice (Figures S5A–D). Following the recovery period,
WT sham, Tg sham and Tg–tx mice were treated with either
vehicle or 10 mg/kg rmuFGF21. In mice treated with rmuFGF21,
body weight was reduced in WT sham mice but not in Tg sham
mice (Figure 4C–D), whereas body weight was significantly
reduced in Tg–tx mice injected with rmuFGF21 compared to
vehicle Tg–tx mice (Figure 4E). Glucose tolerance was improved
in WT sham mice treated with muFGF21, but not in Tg sham
mice also treated with rmuFGF21 when compared to vehicle￾treated mice (Figures 4F–G). Importantly, Tg–tx mice treated with
rmuFGF21 exhibited improved glucose tolerance vs. Tg–tx mice
treated with vehicle (Figure 4H). These data strongly support a
critical role of adipose tissue in eliciting the pharmacologic
response of FGF21 on glucose homeostasis.

Consistent with the GTT data, similar effects with rmuFG21
were observed on insulin levels in the different groups of mice
(Figure 4I). Recombinant muFGF21 reduced insulin levels in WT
sham mice, but not Tg sham mice (Figure 4I; post-treatment),
whereas it lowered insulin levels in Tg–tx mice (of note, this effect
was only statistically significant when comparing the same mice to
their pre-treatment insulin levels). Interestingly, we observed low
plasma levels of adiponectin in Tg mice (Figure 4J), and
transplantation did not alter these levels, however we observed
an increase in rmuFGF21 treated WT mice and also Tg–tx mice
only (no effect in Tg-sham mice) further supporting the beneficial
effects of WAT transplantation and rmuFGF21 treatment.
Recombinant muFGF21 lowered circulating cholesterol levels in
WT and Tg sham mice (Figure 4K). Recombinant muFGF21
exhibited a minimal reduction in cholesterol levels of Tg–tx mice
(Figure 4K), possibly due to the extent of the direct effects of
transplanting adipose tissue alone. Plasma triglycerides levels were
also lowered in Tg–tx mice in response to adipose tissue
transplantation alone (Figure 4L). In WT mice, rmuFGF21 lowered
triglycerides levels as expected, whereas triglycerides were neither
reduced in Tg sham nor Tg–tx mice administered rmuFGF21.
Liver weights were decreased by transplantation (Figure S5D)
yet rmuFGF21 was effective in lowering liver weights only in Tg￾sham mice. BAT weight was not affected by either transplantation
or rmuFGF21 treatment in either WT or Tg mice (Figure S5E).
Only WT adipose tissue weights were decreased in response to
rmuFGF21, and transplantation in Tg mice had no effect on BAT
and WAT (Figure S5E–F).
Changes in Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor
gamma ( ) and Expression in Adipose
Transplanted Lipodystrophy Mice
Following transplantation and rmuFGF21 treatment in Tg and
WT mice Pparg and Fgf21 expression was measured (Figure 5 A–
B). Fgf21 expression was increased in liver and white and brown
adipose tissues (WAT and BAT) 10–25 fold in Tg mice compared
to WT mice. Transplantation reduced liver Fgf21 expression in Tg
mice, as did treatment with rmuFGF21 (Figure 5A). Treatment
with rmuFGF21 had no effect on expression of endogenous Fgf21
in adipose tissues. However it led to a slight increase in expression
of the transplanted adipose. Pparg expression was increased in the
livers of Tg mice compared to WT mice and transplantation
reduced liver Pparg expression in Tg mice in a similar manner to
rmuFGF21 treatment, revealing a similar trend to hepatic Fgf21
expression (Figure 5B). Pparg expression in adipose tissues on the
other hand were in opposition to those patterns observed for Fgf21;
Pparg was approximately 50% lower in Tg adipose tissues
compared to WT mice. Treatment with rmuFGF21 increased
the expression of Pparg in transplanted adipose only.
Histologic Findings in Adipose Transplanted
Lipodystrophy Mice
Liver, WAT and BAT from WT and Tg mice which underwent
transplantation or sham surgery and rmuFGF21 or vehicle
treatment were analyzed histologically and morphologically
(Figure S6A–B). The mice generated herein recapitulated the
histological phenotypes previously published [18] albeit the livers
presented milder hepatosteatosis. The BAT from Tg sham mice
contained a heterogeneous population of adipocytes, some with a
single, large vacuole and others with a more condensed,
eosinophilic cytoplasm containing few, small vacuoles. Cells
thought to be macrophages and/or fibroblasts were also present.
The WAT from Tg sham mice was composed primarily of
adipocytes that varied in size accompanied by scattered cells
thought to be macrophages and/or fibroblasts. Livers from Tg
sham mice showed swollen hepatocytes reflective of steatosis.
Adipose tissue transplantation in Tg mice did not affect the
morphology of BAT or WAT; however, the fat accumulation in
liver was completely reversed (Figure S6A). Recombinant
muFGF21 did not alter the histological phenotypes in WT sham
(data not shown), Tg sham nor Tg–tx mice compared to vehicle
controls. The lack of any observable difference in adipocyte size in
WT or Tg–tx mice treated with rmuFGF21 is surprising given that
the mice lose up to 10% in body weight, likely due to the fact the

Approximately 2 g of wildtype (WT) adipose tissue was transplanted subcutaneously into aP2-nSrebp1c lipodystrophy (Tg) male mice (Animal Study

adipocytes are from lean (non-obese) mice. Nonetheless we
continue to observe a reduction in total fat pad weight (Figure
S5F–G).
A subset of adipose transplants from wildtype mice were excised
to evaluate success of the tissue grafts (Figure S6B). Adipocytes
were separated by cells that were thought to be macrophages and/
or fibroblasts (Figure S6A). All or large portions of the explants
appeared viable with the exception of one mouse in which the
transplant was hemorrhagic and calcified. The data from this
mouse were excluded from the study. Compared to our
transplantation pilot study (Figure S4) we observed increased
inflammation and more heterogeneity in adipocyte sizes in the
explants from the current study. We attribute this to the difference
in the 2 study designs; the pilot mice were transplanted and left to
recover for 4 weeks, whereas the mice presented in Figure 4 were
handled twice daily for injections and for regular measurements.
This additional handling likely disturbed the grafting process of the
transplanted WAT. Nonetheless we still had successful transplan￾tation due to several results, namely, steatosis and liver weights
were much improved (Figure S5D, S6), plasma glucose and
mass was measured in WT and Tg mice before (23 days), immediately after (1 day) and 7, 14, 21 and 28 days following adipose tissue transplantation.
Adipose tissue mass was increased in the Tg transplanted mice after implantation and although declined by MRI analysis was still intact at necropsy.

necropsy. (C–E) Percent change in body weight was calculated daily from the start of rmuFGF21 treatment. Days 17–21 were excluded due to

NEFAs were improved (Figure S5A–B), as were insulin, cholesterol
and triglycerides (Figure 4I, K–L). Thus we concluded transplan￾tation was successful. Recombinant muFGF21 did not alter the
appearance of the WAT explants.
Leptin Restores FGF21 Responsiveness in Lipodystrophy
Mice
Since reconstitution of WT adipose tissue restored efficacy of
rmuFGF21 (Figure 4H–J) we hypothesized that not only was the
absolute amount of adipose tissue relevant but possibly a factor
from adipose alone such as leptin could elicit some of the effects
observed since Tg mice are severely hypoleptinemic and the Tx
animals received WT adipose tissue (with intact leptin). We treated
4 groups of Tg mice with either rmuFGF21, recombinant murine
leptin, both, or vehicle for 15 days. Recombinant muFGF21 was
ineffective in reducing body weight, blood glucose or insulin levels,
or in improving glucose tolerance (Figures 6A–D). Leptin
significantly reduced body weight, and insulin levels, with a
modest reduction in blood glucose and glucose tolerance.
Impressively, rmuFGF21 and leptin co-administration resulted in
significant reductions in body weight, blood glucose and insulin
levels, and improved glucose tolerance. Furthermore, FGF21 and
leptin in combination exhibited greater efficacy than leptin alone,
and in the case of glucose tolerance it reached statistical
significance (Figure 6D).
Discussion
The selective expression of the FGF21 co-receptor b-klotho in
adipose, liver, and pancreas indicates a clear association with
tissues involved in control of glucose and lipid metabolism, but
does not impart which tissue modulates the specific effects of
FGF21 pharmacology. The data presented here suggests that
WAT has a significant role in eliciting the anti-diabetic (glucose
and insulin lowering) efficacy of FGF21, and exogenous leptin can
potentiate FGF21’s actions.
We replicated a recognized model of mouse lipodystrophy [18]
as a basis for our efficacy studies, primarily because it is a fully
penetrant model of adipose deficiency, and has been used
previously to assess the tissue-specific effect of anti-diabetic
therapeutics [21]. Our initial observations of little-to-no effects of
FGF21 in these mice were striking. A confounding aspect of the
Tg mice is that, in addition to their reduction in WAT without
changes in body weight, they replicate human lipodystrophy and
exhibit multi-phenotypic consequences of adipose loss, namely,

hepatomegaly/steatosis, insulin resistance, glucose intolerance,
and chronic inflammation [22], and present hypotriglyceridemia
which we attribute to the FVB genetic background Thus the lack
of efficacy does not indicate directly that WAT is the pharmaco￾logical site of action of FGF21 since other tissues could also be
resistant to FGF21 as a secondary consequence of reduced adipose
mass; however, it does highlight the importance of adipose tissue
per se. Another possibility is that these Tg mice have normal body
weight and very little adipose tissue so they cannot become much
leaner with FGF21 treatment. An important consideration in this
study is that we cannot distinguish the anti-diabetic efficacy from
weight loss caused by FGF21 since all improvements in glucose
homeostasis were coincident with weight loss. In a previous study,
we have shown that FGF21 can improve metabolic parameters
independently of body weight changes [6].
Unexpectedly, the entire FGFR/b-klotho cell signaling cascade
was altered in WAT from Tg mice. Proximally, b-klotho and
FGFR1 mRNA were expressed normally in lipodystrophy WAT.
Interestingly, pY-FRS2 (Figure 3B) and pY-SHP2 (Figure 3C)
were increased and decreased respectively when compared to WT
WAT. Furthermore this phosphorylation pattern in lipodystrophic
WAT was unchanged in response to recombinant FGF21
(Figure 3B), collectively suggesting that FGFR1/FRS2 signaling
was basally activated in WAT and cellular FGF21 resistance was
observed in these mice. Adipose inflammation in this mouse model
could account for the noted basal activation [22]. Indeed, we
observed macrophage infiltration in lipodystrophic WAT (Figure
S6) and thus the heterogeneous nature of this adipose could
obscure the precise signaling events such that the observations are
not reflective of adipocytes. Alternatively, if the changes observed
in FGFR signaling are solely restricted to adipocytes, these data
suggest increased FGFR1 in lipodystrophic adipocytes increases
receptor phosphorylation and manifests in a unique pattern of
FRS phosphorylation that impairs typical FGF21-induced signal￾ing. The increase in plasma FGF21 is of interest and corresponds
to the dramatic increase in Fgf21 expression in liver, BAT and
WAT. It has been reported that the liver accounts for most of
circulating FGF21 [23,24]. Despite the increase in Fgf21
expression in these 3 tissues it appears that the circulating levels
are mostly governed by the liver expression, since transplantation
decreased the elevated FGF21 levels in Tg mice (Figure S5C) and
correlates to a <75% reduction in Fgf21 expression in liver only.
The recent findings [23] that PPARc mediates FGF21’s action
promoted our investigation of Pparg expression in adipose tissues
and liver in our mice. We observed that indeed Tg tissues exhibit
differences in Pparg expression; levels of Pparg in WAT and BAT
were reduced in Tg mice and this profile is consistent with the lack
of efficacy of rmuFGF21, suggesting that PPARc may play a role
FGF21’s effects [23]. An important observation was that Pparg was
increased only in transplanted WAT treated with FGF21–
corresponding to the group of animals with restored efficacy.
We found separable features of efficacy following FGF21
therapy in the Tg mice, notably anti-diabetic vs. cholesterol
lowering. Concomitant with a lack of improvement in insulin
sensitivity, we continued to observe that FGF21 lowered plasma
cholesterol levels (Figures 1J & 4K). Taken together with
maintained FGF21 liver signaling in Tg mice (Figure 3D), it is
possible that the liver is the target tissue for the cholesterol efficacy.
Triglyceride levels were not coordinately lowered alongside
cholesterol levels; in fact, Tg mice were resistant to FGF21-
induced triglyceride lowering. It is possible that adipose tissue is
required for triglyceride lowering efficacy. To support this, is the
observation that FGF21 treatment in Tg-tx mice lead to a small
(but non-significant) triglyceride reduction compared to vehicle￾treated controls. Although this may indicate possible restoration of
FGF21 responsiveness in non-WAT tissue, it highlights a
dependence of WAT for FGF21 function.
Our finding that adipose tissue transplantation completely
restored FGF21 responsiveness was of significant interest. The
extent of the improvement in fat-transplanted Tg mice treated
with FGF21 surpassed the typical effect observed with FGF21
administration in WT mice (Figure 4H. vs. 4F respectively), raising
the possibility that the transplanted tissue not only restored WT
amounts of adipose but also restored physiological functions itself.
This perhaps is of most interest when comparing to a lack of
restoration of TZD efficacy in WAT-transplanted A-ZIP/F-1 mice
[25]. TZDs operate directly on WAT to improve insulin sensitivity
and possibly implantation process leaves the tissue refractory to
those direct actions (due to graft complications) whereas FGF21
co-operates with WAT to improve insulin sensitivity and glucose
homeostasis, indeed we observed that adiponectin levels as a
marker of insulin sensitity was only increased in WT and Tg–tx
mice treated with FGF21. Additionally, the combination therapy
of leptin and FGF21 improved all glucose and insulin measures
(Figures 6A–D). The incremented effect in the GTT bore
resemblance to that of the transplant + FGF21 group in the
transplantation study (Figures 4H and 6D), suggesting that leptin,
may be responsible for restoring part of the anti-diabetic efficacy of
FGF21 in these mice. These data suggest WAT and leptin, but not
liver dictate the anti-diabetic potential of FGF21. Consistent with
this hypothesis is the finding that FGF21-induced signaling in the
liver of lipodystrophic mice appears normal (Figure 3D).
Importantly, we observed a complete lack of FGF21-induced
SHP2 phosphorylation in TG WAT. SHP2, when phosphorylated
on Y542, couples FGF-induced FRS signaling to Grb2 binding
and MAPK activation [26]. Despite our observation of increased
FRS phosphorylation (Figure 3B), this did not correlate with
increased SHP2 phosphorylation (Figure 3C). It is worth
mentioning that FGF21 and leptin pathways possibly converge
on SHP2 [27]. Since SHP2 is also activated in response to leptin￾induced signaling, it will be worthwhile to investigate if leptin and
FGF21 co-operate for typical MAPK activation.
FGF21 is efficacious in leptin null ob/ob mice and indicates that
leptin is not required for FGF21’s anti-diabetic actions. In fact
normal FGF21-induced signaling is observed in ob/ob adipose
[24,28], whereas we observe impaired FGF21 signaling in
lipodystrophy WAT. Possibly, in Tg mice, not only does leptin
exert additive effects to FGF21 on glucose and body weight
lowering but also restores FGF21 resistance. It remains to be
determined if leptin is responsible for the full restoration of FGF21
efficacy in Tg mice, or merely contributes to it; for example
transplantation leads to mild increases in leptin levels, whereas
leptin injections delivered supraphysiological doses. A worthwhile
future experiment would involve the transplantation of ob/ob
WAT into Tg mice to investigate whether leptin is required for the
WAT rescue of efficacy.
In conclusion, our data show that lipodystrophic mice are
resistant to FGF21’s effect on glucose homeostasis and adipose
transplantation or supraphysiological leptin treatment can correct
this impairment. It remains to be determined if leptin restores
FGF21 anti-diabetic efficacy at the adipocyte, or whether other
tissues/organs become FGF21-sensitive (such as the liver or BAT).
Furthermore, the lipodystrophic mice provide a useful tool for
elucidating the tissue-specific metabolic action of FGF21; the liver
governs FGF21-induced cholesterol lowering, whereas the adipose
tissue governs the FGF21-induced effects on triglyceride and
glucose homeostasis. Together, these data have implications for
the pharmacological additivity and interaction of FGF21 and
FGF21 in Lipodystrophy Mice

contained a more heterogeneous population of adipocytes than
seen in BAT and WAT from WT sham mice. This appearance
