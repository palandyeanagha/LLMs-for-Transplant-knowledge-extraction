glucose or saline may be given as rewarming proceeds.
Otherwise there should be minimal interference with
the patient. In particular measures that may precipitate
ventricular fibrillation should be avoided, such as unnecessary
cardiac massage or laryngeal intubation, or, worst of all,
intravenous injection of adrenalin.
More active treatment has long been known to produce
recovery after hypothermia has caused ventricular fibrillation
or arrest, but it is often forgotten that it can do so after arrest
lasting an hour and sometimes considerably longer.4 In
Sweden anyone found apparently dead in cold air or water is
routinely regarded as a candidate for emergency treatment
rather than a casualty for the mortuary. This is particularly
necessary as complicating factors such as "paradoxical
undressing" by victims as hypothermia develops5 may mislead
a rescuer into thinking that they were victims of assault and
injury rather than simple hypothermia. The problem is less
common in countries with less cold winters, but the same
principles should clearly be adopted in cold weather anywhere.
Simple external warming, with or without external cardiac
massage and artificial ventilation, has seldom revived adults
from .hypothermic cardiac arrest or ventricular fibrillation.
This is probably because rewarming is so slow that many
hours may elapse before cardiac temperature rises to the point
at which spontaneous cardiac rhythm restarts or defibrillation
can succeed. Extracorporeal circulation -to provide vascular
rewarming as well as maintenance of circulation -is therefore
the treatment of choice in hypothermic arrest. It may be
achieved by femoral or cardiopulmonary bypass and succeeds
in a high proportion of suitable cases.46
The effort and resources needed for such invasive treatment
have prompted a search for means of identifying victims
capable of being revived. A recent paper suggests that
hyperkalaemia may be a marker for non-recoverable hypo￾thermia as hypothermic victims of avalanches had very high
plasma potassium concentrations (mean 14-5 mmol/l) and
could not be revived.7 Patients with similar core temperatures
after drug intoxication or simple exposure to cold had lower
plasma potassium concentrations (mean 3-5 mmol/l) and
could be revived, though some died later from other con￾ditions. The high plasma potassium concentration probably
reflected asphyxia as well as cardiopulmonary arrest in the
avalanche group, all of whom were clinically dead. All of the
15 patients in the second group seem to have had a heart beat
and respiration when found, although two had a brief arrest at
some stage. The value of a very high serum potassium
concentration as a prognostic indicator in uncomplicated
hypothermia is therefore uncertain, but it may provide a
guide to cases in which resuscitation cannot succeed for other
reasons. Early measurements of plasma potassium concentra￾tions might help in focusing attention on those victims who
could be revived by the heroic measures needed in hypo￾thermic cardiopulmonary arrest.
Most cases of urban hypothermia in Britain are not due to
simple exposure and need different management.8 Most of
these people have collapsed as a result of serious disease and
have cooled as a result of the illness and immobility, often in
heated rooms.9 Blankets and warm air inhalation can be used
to prevent further cooling in any hypothermic person.'0 More
active rewarming of people who have collapsed in their
homes, however, is usually best delayed until admission to
hospital, where the underlying disease, which is often masked
by hypothermia, can be diagnosed and treated effectively.

Cyclosporin: use outside
transplantation
Promising, but long term follow up is essential
The success of cyclosporin A in allograft transplantation
stems from its selective immunological action on T lympho￾cytes and its much lower ratio of risk to benefit than cytotoxic
drugs. Enthusiasm for the drug is tempered by its potential
toxicity, particularly nephrotoxicity,' and by the risks associ￾ated with chronic immunosuppression. Nevertheless,
cyclosporin's potential is being investigated in a wide variety
of autoimmune diseases.23 A recent symposium organised by
the Royal Society of Medicine reached some consensus on the
use of cyclosporin outside transplantation and on its relative
efficacy and potential.
Cyclosporin inhibits T lymphocyte activation and pro￾liferation but is not cytotoxic. Unlike corticosteroids,
azathioprine, and other cytotoxic drugs, it inhibits selectively
both antigen induced activation of CD4+ (T helper)
lymphocytes and the production by these cells of interleukin 2
and other cytokines.45 Cyclosporin can also interrupt active
immune responses, as shown by its efficacy in treating
autoimmune diseases -presumably by blocking the secretion
of cytokines by lymphocytes. The drug inhibits the in vivo
transcription of genes encoding interleukin 2 and interferon y6
and blocks the expression of interleukin 2 receptors, whose
induction is essential to T cell proliferation.
It is now clear that cyclosporin reversibly inhibits early,
calcium dependent events in T lymphocyte activation and
that there are probably several molecular targets within the
cell membrane, cytosol, and nucleus.4 The most exciting new
developments concern the uptake and concentration of
cyclosporin in cystolic and nuclear target sites mediated by
cyclophilin, a recently discovered enzyme (peptidylprolyl
isomerase). The relation between T cell activation and the
function of this enzyme is unknown, but, by interfering with
cyclophilin's role in the folding of regulatory peptides, the
drug may prevent the formation or function of nuclear factors
that regulate the expression of cytokine genes.7 Recent
evidence suggests that cyclosporin blocks the function of a
gene termed NF-AT (nuclear factor of activated T cells),
which may be the immediate or early regulator of T cell
activation.8 These properties of cyclosporin are shared by the
novel anti-T cell agent FK-506, which may also have
important clinical potential.910
In view of its molecular action not surprisingly cyclosporin
will induce and maintain remission in many autoimmune
disorders, particularly those with mechanisms mediated by T
cells. Cyclosporin's effectiveness has been established in

randomised controlled studies in psoriasis, " insulin dependent
diabetes mellitus,'2 and uveitis'3; and promising results have
been obtained in rheumatoid arthritis,"4 myasthenia gravis,5
primary biliary cirrhosis,'6 and Crohn's disease.'7 Its efficacy
has also been shown in uncontrolled trials in the nephrotic
syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, and various
dermatological and haematological disorders, although not in
multiple sclerosis. " In psoriasis in particular, cyclosporin has
been shown to be effective and safe for up to one year provided
that the guidelines for treatment are strictly observed. 19 Long
term experience in these conditions is still limited.
Several features are common to these studies in different
conditions. Cyclosporin has a quick onset of effect (within two
to 12 weeks, depending on dosage), but relapse after
withdrawing it is almost universal and is in keeping with the
reversible inhibitory action of cyclosporin on cytokine
synthesis by T lymphocytes. Cyclosporin does not affect the
clinical course of the disease. Nevertheless, many patients
who are unresponsive to or intolerant of conventional drug
treatment may benefit from cyclosporin or achieve a useful
reduction in their steroid dosage.
Cyclosporin may do far more than simply act on T cells. It
seems to be effective in some autoimmune disorders associated
with antibodies-for example, pemphigus and pemphigoid
and myasthenia gravis. In skin diseases it may well have an
anti-inflammatory action through inhibiting eicosanoid
synthesis, while in the nephrotic syndrome it may act
predominantly through a haemodynamic action to reduce
excretion of protein. Because of the possible drug interactions
and other adverse effects careful review of all patients is
mandatory. Among the guidelines for its safe use are an initial
dosage of no more than 5 mg/kg a day, unless a rapid effect is
critical, and the maintenance of trough blood concentrations
of cyclosporin at 200 ng/ml or less (as measured by radio￾immunoassay). If serum creatinine concentrations rise more
than 30% above baseline the dose should be reduced. The use
of cyclosporin in less advanced disease-for example, in acute
type 1 diabetes-has to be individually and carefully balanced
against the risks of both the disease and alternative treatment.
Drug toxicity may outweigh the apparent benefit of improved
efficacy. Long term follow up is essential to monitor blood
pressure and to ascertain the risk of chronic irreversible renal
impairment and the consequences of chronic immunosup￾pression.
Though further clinical trials of cyclosporin, both alone
and in combination, are justified in autoimmune disease,
these must be restricted to formal investigations conducted by
experienced clinicians skilled in using cyclosporin and with
facilities for monitoring the long term risks. Only then will it
be possible to pass valid judgment on its value for autoimmune
disease.

Child health computing
A springboardfor a community health register
One of the unsung successes of British child health services
has been the development ofcomputerised health information
systems, pioneered in West Sussex in the early 1960s.' By
exploiting surplus capacity on the county council's computer,
West Sussex's public health department computerised its
birth notifications and thus formed the basis for recording
immunisation data. The system was developed so that it
would organise appointments, produce invitations with
appointment times, record the immunisation details, and
then write a cheque for the doctor who did the immunisations.
Soon West Sussex found that its immunisation rate had risen
to at least 15% above that of neighbouring districts using
manual recording methods.2 Other districts adopted similar
systems and found not only that their immunisation perfor￾mance improved but that morbidity -as measured by measles
notifications-was reduced.3 S.ubsequently, the development
of a national child health computer system was taken on by the
NHS, along with the child health services themselves, and has
now reached the point at which the system could form the
basis of a total community register, forging links with primary
care and recording events into adulthood.
When the NHS took over child health services in 1974 its
computerised vaccination and immunisation system was
based on the ICL mainframe computers operated by regional
computer centres. The first two modules of the system-child
register and immunisation -were generally available by 1977
and operational in 60% of districts in England and Wales by
1983.4 A system for scheduling preschool surveillance checks
was implemented in 1984, followed by an extension to school
health checks in 1985.5 In 1984 an alternative version of the
system, written in MUMPS (Massachusetts University
Medical Programme Systems) language and based on DEC
equipment, provided an opportunity to move away from
centralised batch processing to an on line system based in
districts, and the ICL system soon followed suit in allowing
direct data entry. Although the ICL and MUMPS systems
have developed at different rates, both versions have a
common core specification. Meanwhile some regions have
