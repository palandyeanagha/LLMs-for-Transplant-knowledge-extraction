Pathological features of PAH
Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is diagnosed by an eleva￾tion in mean pulmonary arterial (PA) pressure above 25 mmHg at 
rest or 30 mmHg with exercise. Patients usually present with much 
higher levels of PA pressure, but only vague and insidious symp￾toms of increasing fatigue and dyspnea; some patients are diag￾nosed only after syncopal episodes, which can reflect suprasystem￾ic levels of PA pressure and low cardiac output. The causes of PAH 
were reclassified according to a consensus at the Fourth World 
Symposium of Pulmonary Hypertension in Dana Point, California, 
USA, in 2008 and published by Simonneau and colleagues in 2009 
(see Dana Point classification of pulmonary hypertension and ref. 1). 
While this review focuses on pulmonary hypertension category 1 
(i.e., PAH), pathophysiologic insights can also be gained from 
understanding other causes of pulmonary hypertension. Hence, 
experimental studies in hypoxic animals are also discussed.
In neonates and in infants, PAH likely results from failure of the 
neonatal pulmonary vasculature to dilate at birth, and pathologi￾cal changes in the blood vessels are evident in the first few days of 
life. Most prominent is abnormal muscularization of distal PAs at 
the alveolar duct and wall levels and a striking reduction in their 
number. In older infants and adults, there is also progressive inti￾mal hyperplasia leading to occlusive changes in the PAs and plexi￾form lesions (Figure 1 and see below).
PA EC alterations in the clinical (2) and experimental (3) setting 
precede muscularization of distal PAs. In PA ECs from patients 
with idiopathic PAH (IPAH), an increase in Tie2 receptor expres￾sion in ECs releases serotonin, mediating SMC proliferation (4). 
Dysfunctional ECs can either release factors that stimulate SMC 
proliferation, such as FGF-2 (5), or fail to produce agents that nor￾mally suppress proliferation of SMCs in response to growth fac￾tors, such as apelin (encoded by Apln) (6).
Muscularization of distal, normally nonmuscular, PAs at the 
alveolar duct and wall level is associated with differentiation of 
pericytes into SMCs that subsequently proliferate. The progressive 
thickening of the wall of more proximal intraacinar and preacinar 
muscular arteries and the obliteration associated with neointimal 
formation are attributed to increased proliferation and migration 
of cells considered to be SMCs because they are α-SMA positive 
(7). The origin of these cells is unclear, and the mechanism of their 
dysregulation is the subject of intense study. They may represent 
a specialized subpopulation of SMCs; they may originate as stem 
cells (8) or fibrocytes (9) or transform from ECs (10, 11). The loss 
of distal PAs could be caused by alterations in ECs and/or pericytes 
resulting in apoptosis (12).
Later in disease, there is dysregulated EC proliferation, produc￾ing aberrant channels in the otherwise obliterated lumen of the 
vessel and in the adventitia (i.e., the plexiform lesion). These chan￾nels may reflect clonal expansion of apoptosis-resistant ECs (13), 
or they may be derived from circulating endothelial progenitor 
cells (EPCs) that accumulate at sites of endothelial denudation or 
injury and expand locally (14). PA ECs from patients with IPAH 
produce decreased amounts of NO. Synthesized largely by eNOS 
in ECs of the pulmonary vasculature, NO is a vasodilator and sup￾pressor of SMC proliferation. The reduction in NO may be related 
to high arginase levels (15), because l-arginine, the substrate of 
eNOS, is required to produce NO. ECs from patients with PAH 
may be highly proliferative in response to growth factors (14) and 
exhibit high rates of glycolysis (16) that reflect impaired mito￾chondrial metabolism. The dysfunction of these cells is revealed in 
their inability to form normal tubes in culture, consistent with the 
fact that they fail to restore occluded or lost precapillary vessels.
Strategies to improve NO delivery to tissues have been successful 
experimentally, and provision of nitrite can block both the sequelae 
of hypoxia and inflammation in PAH patients (see Emerging therapeu￾tic strategies for pulmonary hypertension and ref. 17). Similarly, inhibit￾ing asymmetric dimethyl arginine (ADMA) by activating dimethy￾larginine dimethyl hydrolase (DDAH) may be useful in allowing 
greater production of NO (18). Current therapies for PAH include 
targeting reduced prostacyclin and increased endothelin levels. A 
more complete discussion can be found in the supplemental mate￾rial (available online with this article; doi:10.1172/JCI60658DS1).
Additional features of PAH include thickening of the pulmonary 
adventitia and venous hypertrophy (19) and increased expression of 
TGF-β; matrix proteins such as elastin, fibronectin, and tenascin-C;

Recent clinical and experimental studies are redefining the cellular and molecular bases of pulmo￾nary arterial hypertension (PAH). The genetic abnormalities first identified in association with 
the idiopathic form of PAH — together with a vast increase in our understanding of cell signal￾ing, cell transformation, and cell-cell interactions; gene expression; microRNA processing; and 
mitochondrial and ion channel function — have helped explain the abnormal response of vascular 
cells to injury. Experimental and clinical studies now converge on the intersection and interac￾tions between a genetic predisposition involving the BMPR2 signaling pathway and an impaired 
metabolic and chronic inflammatory state in the vessel wall. These deranged processes culminate in an exuberant 
proliferative response that occludes the pulmonary arterial (PA) lumen and obliterates the most distal intraacinar 
vessels. Here, we describe emerging therapies based on preclinical studies that address these converging pathways.

and glycosaminoglycans (20). In addition to macrophages, B and 
T cells (21) abound in the perivascular space and are often seen 
invading the vessel wall, and there is heightened expression of 
inflammatory mediators such as S100A4 (22) and fractalkine (23).
Genetics of PAH: BMPR2 and other TGF-β family 
members
Genetic studies have demonstrated that 70% or more of patients 
with hereditary PAH (24, 25), and 10%–20% of patients with spo￾radic IPAH, are heterozygous for a mutation in bone morphoge￾netic protein (BMP) receptor type 2 (BMPR2). BMPR2 is a member 
of the TGF-β superfamily of growth factor receptors. Mutations 
can affect different functions of BMPR2, namely the ligand-bind￾ing domain, the signaling mechanism, and the interaction of the 
receptor with the cytoskeleton. BMPR2 is expressed ubiquitously 
and, in association with a coreceptor (usually BMPR1A), can sig￾nal through many different pathways, including pSmad1/5 (26), 
p-p38 (27), pERK, JNK, and Akt/PI3K (28, 29).
The penetrance of heritable PAH is low: 80% of family members 
carrying BMPR2 mutations will never develop PAH (30). The pres￾ence of a BMPR2 mutation is much lower (i.e., 6%–8%) in patients 
with PAH related to a congenital left-to-right shunt (31) and is rare 
in patients with PAH associated with appetite suppressants (32). 
The functional link between mutations in BMPR2 and PAH is 
reinforced by the fact that independent of a mutation in BMPR2, 
most IPAH patients have reduced BMPR2 protein expression, as 
do, to some extent, patients with PAH associated with other condi￾tions (33). In addition, mutations in the effectors of the signaling 
pathway and in the TGF-β superfamily of receptors have also been 
described in patients with PAH and IPAH (34). For example, activin￾like kinase type 1 (ALK1) and endoglin are mutated in patients with 
hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and with PAH (35, 36). In 
fact, the ALK1-deficient mouse develops spontaneous pulmonary 
hypertension, whereas the BMPR2-heterozygous mouse model 
requires additional perturbations, such as both hypoxia and sero￾tonin or inflammation, to elicit an exaggerated pulmonary hyper￾tensive phenotype (37). In addition, somatic mutations in ECs from 
patients with pulmonary hypertension have been described (38).
New links have been established among BMPR2 signaling, Smad 
activation, and the processing of microRNAs (39), particularly 
miR-21, which can control functions critical to SMC contractil￾ity (40). Indeed, altered microRNA processing has been described 
in heritable PAH (41), and altered microRNA profiles are seen in 
experimental and clinical PAH (42).
Various strategies have been undertaken to rescue BMPR2 loss 
of function directly by gene therapy (43) and by improving traf￾ficking of mutant receptors (44). Since loss of BMPR2 leads to an 
adverse response to TGF-β signaling (45), therapies that inhibit 
the TGF-β receptor ALK5 may also be efficacious in PAH (46).
BMPR2 and vascular cell dysfunction
When loss of BMPR2 is induced by RNA interference in PA ECs, the 
cells become susceptible to apoptosis (47). This vulnerability of ECs 
with loss of BMPR2 can explain the reduced number of peripheral 
alveolar duct and wall PAs. Our group has shown that BMPs, via 
BMPR2, activate the canonical Wnt signaling pathway to induce PA 
EC survival and proliferation and activate the noncanonical path￾way to induce migration, critical features in angiogenesis and regen￾eration of damaged blood vessels (48). Further work by our group 
showed that a complex between β-catenin and PPARγ is essential 
in directing these functions and that a key downstream gene tran￾scribed by this complex is apelin (6). Apelin has autocrine effects in 
promoting PA EC survival and migration and paracrine effects in 
suppressing aberrant PA SMC growth. Mice with PPARγ deleted in 
ECs develop spontaneous PAH (49) that is reversed by treatment 
with apelin (6). Our studies also showed the efficacy of using natural￾ly occurring PPARγ adducts, such as nitro–fatty acids (NO2-FAs), to 
rescue BMPR2 dysfunction. Both NO2-FA and similarly reactive elec￾trophilic keto-FAs display nanomolar affinities for PPARγ (50) and 
mediate distinctive patterns of PPARγ-dependent gene expression. 
This is in addition to their antioxidant properties, related to activa￾tion of Nrf2, and antiinflammatory properties, related to inhibition 
of NF-κB. Another transcription factor that has a beneficial effect in 
rescuing BMPR2 dysfunction in PA ECs appears to be Id1 (51).
Loss of BMPR2 causes proliferation of PA SMCs in response to 
TGF-β1 and BMP2, in contrast to the inhibition of SMC prolifera￾tion and increased susceptibility to apoptosis normally observed 
with these morphogens. Normal BMPR2 signaling negatively 
regulates PDGF (52) and likely other growth-promoting factors 
implicated in the pathobiology of PAH, such as EGF (53). Since 
BMP4 induces differentiation of fetal lung fibroblasts into SMCs 
and inhibits their proliferation (54), lack of BMP4/BMPR2 interac￾tion might expand the myofibroblast population of cells, account￾ing for the adventitial and intimal thickening of the PAs in PAH.
In cultured PA SMCs, BMP2 regulates PPARγ transcriptional activ￾ity (52), and APOE is a key target gene. Mice with deletion of Apoe
develop pulmonary hypertension on a high-fat diet (55), as do mice 
with deletion of Pparg in SMCs (52), even when fed a normal diet. In 
systemic arterial SMCs, apoE can repress proliferation by phosphory￾lating and internalizing the coreceptor of PDGF, LDL receptor–relat￾ed protein 1 (LRP1) (56). Repression of the PDGF receptor by ima￾tinib (Gleevec) can reverse experimental pulmonary hypertension in 
rats (57) and may improve outcome in patients with end-stage PAH

(58). Moreover, dasatinib, a very potent inhibitor of the BCR/ABL 
tyrosine kinase, also appears promising as a future therapy (59).
In addition to apoE, another key target of PPARγ is adiponectin, 
which can sequester PDGF-BB (60) and repress PA SMC prolif￾eration. Treatment of Apoe–/– mice with the PPARγ agonist rosigli￾tazone reverses PAH and raises adiponectin levels (55). However, 
rosiglitazone adversely affects PA EC survival in association with 
disruption of the PPARγ/β-catenin transcription factor complex 
(6). This side effect was not observed with naturally occurring 
adducts, such as NO2-FAs. Other sequelae of BMPR2 dysfunction 
implicated in proliferation of vascular SMCs include heightened 
production of osteoprotegrin (61) and tenascin-C (62). Osteopro￾tegerin is increased in pulmonary vascular lesions and in serum 
of patients with PAH and can increase PA SMC proliferation and 
migration. Tenascin-C can cluster integrins and activate growth 
factor receptors in SMC and induce their proliferation (63). Circu￾lating osteopontin is also increased in PAH and indicates patients 
with more severe symptomatology (64). Given the functional sig￾nificance of BMPR2 signaling, it is not surprising that penetrance 
of the mutation appears to depend on the level of production of 
BMPR2 from the normal allele (30). Conversely, haploinsuffi￾ciency of BMPR2 (65), or even expression of dominant-negative 
BMPR2 in SMCs (66), in mice requires addition of other stimuli 
to bring out a more severe PAH phenotype (67).
Drugs and toxins
The high incidence of PAH in patients taking anorexigens implicated 
serotonin-like compounds in the pathobiology of the disease (68). 
There are additive effects of serotonin and the anorexigen dexfen￾fluramine in causing PAH (69). There is also evidence in female PAH 
patients of an additive effect between seratonin and 17β-estradiol 
levels (70). Serotonin has structural and functional similarities to 
compounds such as cocaine and amphetamine. Abuse of these com￾pounds is also associated with PAH (71). This suggests a relationship 
between heightened signaling via G protein–coupled serotonin and 
serotonin-like receptors and PAH. There is also evidence of interplay 
among HIV, cocaine abuse, and heightened activity of PDGF (72).
Serotonin receptors and transporters
Elevated serotonin levels and serotonin transport have been impli￾cated in the pathology of experimental and clinical PAH. One 
study identified a gain-of-function polymorphism in the sero￾tonin transporter in patients with PAH (73), but this modifier was 
not observed in different populations of PAH patients. Serotonin 
exaggerates vasoreactivity in the fawn-hooded rat (74), and there is 
attenuated severity of pulmonary vascular disease in mice lacking 
the serotonin transporter gene (75). In contrast, mice overexpress￾ing the serotonin transporter globally (76) or specifically in SMCs 
(77) develop worsened hypoxia-induced PAH. PDGF-mediated 
proliferation of SMCs can be compounded by increased activity 
of the serotonin transporter, since this enhances PDGF receptor 
β–mediated signaling (78). Other studies have shown that sero￾tonin-mediated stimulation of the serotonin transporter and the 
serotonin receptors induces expression of cyclins and c-fos (79), 
which are critical to the PA SMC proliferative response.
Serotonin stimulates an increase in S100A4, a member of the 
S100 family of calcium-binding proteins (80) that induces prolif￾eration and migration of PA SMCs (80) and is increased in neo￾intimal lesions from patients with IPAH and PAH associated with 
other conditions. Moreover, a mouse that overexpresses S100A4 
can spontaneously (albeit rarely) develop pulmonary vascular 
pathology (22), and consistently does so when concomitantly 
infected with murine gamma herpes (MHV68, the murine homo￾log of HHV8; ref. 81). The latter study, coupled with the observa￾tion of increased incidence of PAH in patients with HIV, under￾scores the importance of immune mechanisms and inflammation 
in PAH pathobiology as well as the above-described interplay 
among serotonergic compounds, PDGF, and HIV (72).

lesions therein.

Inflammation and immune mechanisms
Increasing attention is being focused on the proinflammatory 
state of the vessel wall in the progression of PAH. The develop￾ment of PAH in a subset of patients with HIV infection may be a 
function of the patient’s HLA class II alleles (82). Moreover, a link 
was made between expression of HHV8 (associated with Kaposi 
sarcoma) and IPAH (83). It also appears that the Kaposi sarcoma 
virus can stimulate lysosome-mediated degradation of BMPR2 
(84). Recent studies suggested a link between the HIV-nef gene 
and plexogenic pulmonary vascular lesions in PAH in HIV-infected 
patients and SIV-infected nonhuman primates (85).
There is a high incidence of PAH in areas of the world endemic 
for schistosomiasis. About 10% of patients with schistosomia￾sis will develop portal hypertension, and 10% of those will have 
PAH. Chronic infection of mice with high-dose cercariae results 
in severe but spotty lung vascular remodeling (86, 87), albeit with 
a relatively modest pulmonary hypertensive response. Treatment 
of the schistosomiasis in these mice induces regression of the 
pathology (86). Allergic responses to ovalbumin or to Aspergillus
species in mice can also cause extensive spotty pulmonary vascular 
remodeling, without pulmonary hypertension (88). In this model, 
an IL-13–mediated increase in α-resistin is associated with SMC 
proliferation, but the functional significance of this molecule in 
scleroderma and PAH (89) and in experimental schistosomiasis 
(87) is not known. In mice lacking prostaglandin synthase, induc￾tion of allergic inflammation with the house dust mite induces 
intense pulmonary vascular remodeling, changes that are reversed 
by administration of prostaglandin E2 (90).
In the experimental setting, haploinsufficiency of BMPR2 is asso￾ciated with an exaggerated pulmonary hypertensive response to an 
inflammatory stimulus (91). Other experimental models of chronic 
inflammation, such as repeated injections of endotoxin (92) or 
TNF-α (93), also cause pulmonary vascular changes. In the rodent 
model of pulmonary hypertension, depletion of T cell subsets wors￾ens the pathology (94). This has been attributed to unbalanced B cell 
activity resulting from impaired Tregs (95). In the athymic rat given 
the VEGF receptor blocker, reconstitution with Tregs was sufficient 
to rescue PAH in association with elevated BMPR2 levels. In inflam￾matory PAH, complement appears to play an essential role (96).
Heightened circulating levels of cytokines and their receptors 
have been demonstrated in IPAH patients; these include fractal￾kine, stromal derived factor–1 (SDF-1), monocyte chemoattractant 
protein–1 (MCP-1), and granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulat￾ing factor (reviewed in ref. 97). Loss of BMPR2 induces IL-6 (98), 
a cytokine that can cause severe pulmonary vascular disease in 
rodents (99) in association with SMC proliferation (100) medi￾ated by the transcription factor Kruppel-like factor 5 (101). Regu￾lation of epigenetic factors may reverse inflammatory processes. 
In hypoxia-associated PAH, activation of fibroblasts expressing 
elevated levels of cytokines was linked to increased histone deacet￾ylase 1 (HDAC1), inhibition of which reversed both the fibroblast 
phenotype and PAH in experimental animals (102).
An increase in perivascular macrophages is essential to the devel￾opment of hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension in experi￾mental animals, and this phenomenon is observed in lung tissue 
from patients with IPAH (103). Mononuclear fibrocytes, cells 
that have characteristics of both fibroblasts and leukocytes (104), 
have been identified as key contributors to the remodeling of the 
pulmonary vasculature. These cells may migrate into the vessel 
wall through the angiomata located in the expanding adventitia 
(9). At least some of the cells in the neointimal lesions may have 
originated as invading fibrocytes; indeed, high levels of circulating 
fibrocytes are found in adults and children with pulmonary hyper￾tension (105). Tertiary lymphoid tissue was described in patients 
with IPAH as evidence of altered immune regulation (106). Simi￾larly, circulating autoantibodies are observed in patients with both 
autoimmune and idiopathic and other associated forms of pulmo￾nary hypertension, but the role of these antibodies in the pathol￾ogy is the subject of considerable investigation (107).
Previous studies suggested that heightened expression of the tran￾scription factor nuclear factor of activated T cells c2 (NFATc2) (108), 
which is associated with activated inflammatory cells, may underlie 
PAH. Increased nuclear NFATc2 is observed in T cells from IPAH 
patients and in pulmonary vascular lesions, and this can lead to 
repression of voltage-gated K+ (Kv) 1.5 channel expression and influx 
of intracellular Ca+, causing contraction and proliferation of SMCs. 
NFATc2 nuclear translocation can be inhibited by cyclosporine as 
well as by tacrolimus (also known as FK-506). Recently, it was shown 
that miR-204 is reduced in PAH, and low miR-204 increases the level 
of phosphatase Shp2, which in turn activates NFATc2 (109).
Elastase activity
Ultrastructural studies of PAs from children with congenital heart 
defects and associated PAH suggested that elastolytic activity may 
be an early feature of this complication (2). Elevated serine elastase 
activity was subsequently documented in rodent and murine models 
of PAH (110), which led to the successful experimental use of elastase 
inhibitors to prevent pulmonary vascular pathology (Figure 2 and

refs. 111, 112). The mechanism relating elastase activity to PAH is 
based on studies in cultured PA SMCs showing that serum and EC 
factors can mediate the cells’ production of serine elastase. This 
enzyme can release growth factors from the extracellular matrix (5) 
and induce production of matrix metalloproteinases and tenascin-C, 
a glycoprotein associated with activation of SMC growth factor 
receptors and survival pathways (Figure 2 and ref. 63). These stud￾ies led to work showing that elastase inhibitors not only prevent, 
but also reverse, experimental pulmonary hypertension by inducing 
apoptosis of SMCs (113). Regression of experimental pulmonary 
hypertension was also achieved by blocking a downstream effector 
of elastase, the EGF receptor (53). Blockade of the PDGF tyrosine 
kinase receptor by imatinib had a similar effect (57). Similarly, trans￾fection of a dominant-negative survivin construct (114) blocked a 
downstream effector of growth factor signaling and was also effective 
in reversing PAH through SMC apoptosis. Recently, we found that 
the relevant PA SMC elastase in PAH is neutrophil elastase (115). PA 
SMCs from mice that overexpress S100A4 have elevated levels of neu￾trophil elastase mRNA and protein, as do PA SMCs from patients 
with IPAH. Inhibition of elastase with the naturally occurring serine 
elastase inhibitor elafin attenuated the development of neointimal 
lesions in the S100A4 mice that are infected with virus.
An interesting link has been made between metabolism and 
inflammation by showing that the reduced adiponectin seen in 
insulin resistance (116) leads to recruitment of eosinophils that can 
play a profound role in the development of pulmonary vascular 
disease. Another study linked endothelin with the unfolded protein 
response, mitochondrial dysfunction, and inflammation (117).
Glycolytic metabolism and the Warburg effect
The fawn-hooded rat, which has defective serotonin metabolism 
and develops PAH in response to relative alveolar hypoxia at mile￾high altitude, also has abnormal oxygen sensing in the mitochon￾dria of SMCs, leading to reduced Kv channel 
function (118). Hyperpolarized mitochon￾dria cause normoxic stimulation of HIF-1α
(a phenomenon known as the Warburg 
effect), leading to reduced cytochrome c
oxidase and SOD levels and impaired Kv 
channel expression and function (Figure 2). 
In the fawn-hooded rat, in association 
with hyperpolarized mitochondria, there is 
hypermethylation of the SOD2 promoter in 
PAs, but not aortic SMCs. Demethylating 
agents can reverse the apoptosis-resistant 
phenotype of the SMCs and the pulmonary 
hypertension in these rats (119).
Interestingly, BMP2-mediated BMPR2 
signaling has been directly related to expres￾sion of Kv channels (120); conversely, sero￾tonin can directly inhibit rat PA Kv channels 
(121). Moreover, transfer of Kv channels has 
been used as an experimental strategy in 
animal models to prevent and reverse PAH 
(122). Reversal of the mitochondrial abnor￾mality and Kv channel dysfunction can be 
achieved through the pyruvate dehydroge￾nase kinase (PDK) inhibitor dicholoracetate 
(DCA) (118), in association with regression 
of pulmonary vascular remodeling. The link 
between metabolism and inflammation is reinforced by studies 
showing that the cytokine TNF-α can cause mitochondrial hyper￾polarization that is also reversible by DCA (123).
Manipulation of the glycolytic pathway can also be achieved by 
suppression of malonyl conenzyme decarboxylase. This reduces 
FA oxidation and reverses chronic pulmonary hypertension (124). 
Interestingly, ER stress increases the distance between the ER and 
the mitchondria in PA, but not systemic SMCs, and this occurs 
through activation of ATF6 and transcription of Nogo-B. The 
increased distance results in inhibition of calcium-sensitive mito￾chondrial enzymes and decreases mitochondrial-dependent apop￾tosis (123), thus facilitating SMC proliferation.
It appears that the inability of cells to undergo autophagy (125) 
is linked to heightened oxidative stress, HIF-1α stabilization, 
increased intracellular Ca+, suppression of Kv channel function, and 
worsening of hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension (126). An 
increase in HIF-2α also promotes PAH, as is evident in von Hippel 
Lindau disease (127).
Recent reports of elevated transient receptor potential (TRP) cal￾cium channels TRP3 and TRP6 in PA SMCs from IPAH patients 
indicated that inhibition of these channels can repress the height￾ened proliferation observed in SMCs (128). Inhibition of PKA or 
activation of cAMP seem to have a similar effect (129).
Gender and estrogen metabolism
Reduced expression of BMPR2 from the normal allele can dis￾tinguish unaffected from PAH-affected family members with a 
BMPR2 mutation (30), and this appears to be estrogen dependent. 
The female predisposition to IPAH may also be related to aberrant 
expression of a cytochrome, CYP1B1, that leads to a mitogenic 
estrogen metabolite (130). Experimental studies attribute the mani￾festation of pulmonary vascular pathology in S100A4-overexpress￾ing female mice to 17β-estradiol induction of receptor for advanced

glycosylation end-products (RAGE), the S100A4 receptor (131). In 
contrast, both estrogen and activation of the estrogen receptor β
(ERβ) is protective against the development of experimental pul￾monary hypertension (132, 133), so preferential engagement of the 
ERα may dictate the development of PAH in females. Also, the lack 
of insulin resistance and of PAH in Apoe–/– female mice fed a Western 
diet has been attributed to heightened levels of adiponectin (55); the 
low level of adiponectin in males is related to testosterone-mediated 
degradation. Metabolic syndrome, however, is increased in females 
with IPAH compared with the general population (134), so low adi￾ponectin may place females at heightened risk for PAH.
Stem and progenitor cells
A major effort is being directed at understanding the mechanisms 
underlying recruitment of circulating EPCs (135) and endothelial￾derived autocrine signals (136), with the view toward applying this 
knowledge to regenerating normal microvessels. EPCs engineered 
to express eNOS were successfully applied first to experimental 
PAH (137), and are currently being tested in the clinical setting. 
Mesenchymal cells also attenuate experimentally induced PAH 
and improve RV performance (138, 139).
Although the focus in understanding the mechanism of PAH 
has been on the small PAs (less than 500 μM), changes in imped￾ance (140) resulting from stiffening of the more proximal as well 
as the distal PAs may also be a critical determinant of RV function 
(141). BMPR2 mutations associated with PAH may also influence 
the remodeling pathology of proximal PAs and of cardiac myo￾cytes and fibroblasts. For example, a mosaic deletion of BMPR1A 
improves distal PA remodeling, but creates stiffer proximal PAs 
(142). Basic questions remain as to why the RV might fail under 
conditions such as scleroderma (143), when PA pressure and resis￾tance are not highly elevated. However, a discussion of RV and 
large PA function in the context of PAH merits its own review.
New directions
This review attempts to show that the myriad molecules and path￾ways implicated in PAH pathobiology are all interconnected. There 
is a genetic predisposition that is linked either directly or indirect￾ly to the BMPR2 signaling pathway in vascular and in inflamma￾tory/immune cells. This affects the response of the tissue to an 
infectious or inflammatory stimulus. Inflammation and oxidative 
stress also have profound effects on mitochondrial metabolism 
and gene regulation (Figure 2).
Thus far, in clinical or in experimental studies, little attention 
has been given to the microbiome in pulmonary hypertension and 
to the induction of inflammasomes and their potential role in the 
remodeling associated with PAH (144). Next-generation sequenc￾ing combined with proteomics and metabolomics will further 
identify gene variants and epigenetic changes that underlie the 
pathobiology of PAH. The use of induced pluripotent stem cells 
differentiated into vascular cells could be useful (145) in better 
stratifying and personalizing newly emerging PAH therapies (see 
Emerging therapeutic strategies for pulmonary hypertension), if these cells 
reflect the genetic and epigenetic features causing the cellular dys￾function associated with PAH.
