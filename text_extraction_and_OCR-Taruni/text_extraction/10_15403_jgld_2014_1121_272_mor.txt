INTRODUCTION
Liver transplantation is a 
worldwide standard treatment 
for end-stage liver disease 
and for some specific stages 
of hepatocellular carcinoma. 
However, there has been an 
acute shortage of liver grafts 
from deceased donors for many 
years. Subsequently, the dropout 
of patients due to progression 
of disease and the mortality 
rate during the waiting time are 
both increasing, according to 
data from the French National 
Transplantation Agency (“Agence 
de Biomédecine”) (Table I). 
Similar data are reported in North 
America [1, 2]. This growing gap 
between the number of deceased 
donor organs and the number of 
patients on the waiting list for 
SYSTEMATIC REVIEW
ABSTRACT
Background & Aims: The main restriction in the development of adult-adult Living Donor Liver 
Transplantation (LDLT) is the risk of morbidity and mortality for donors, which raises ethical questions. The 
objectives of this study are to review published studies dealing with morbidity and mortality in LDLT and 
to identify the proposed management and strategies for preventing donor mortality and morbidity in LDLT. 
Methods: The Medline database was searched from 2000 to 2017 using the MeSH terms “liver transplantation” 
and “morbidity” or “mortality” in combination with keywords “living donor liver transplantation”. 
Results: Among the 382 articles obtained, 43 articles were relevant for morbidity, 15 for mortality and 6 for 
both morbidity and mortality. Twenty-three papers reported donor deaths. The major cause of death was 
sepsis (30%). Morbidity ranged from 10% to 78.3% depending on the studies. 
Conclusions: The living donors’ morbidity and mortality is high, currently representing the main restriction 
in the development of LDLT. Some promising techniques, such as the donor portal vein flow modulation 
could lead to the further development of LDLT.
Key words: living donor – living donor liver transplantation – morbidity – mortality – preconditioning.

liver transplantation has motivated the use of other sources 
of grafts, such as living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). 
The principle of LDLT is based on the ability of the liver 
parenchyma to regenerate. Indeed, the liver is comprised 
of autonomous vascular territories, allowing the division 
of the liver into different partial grafts. The effective liver 
regeneration is possible if 30% of its initial mass is respected, 
which corresponds on average to 0.5% of the individual’s 
body weight [3]. On the other hand, the necessary mass of 
liver parenchyma for the recipients is at least 1% of their body 
weight. Therefore, the right liver is often chosen in order to 
achieve the receiver needs. 
Historically, the first attempt of adult-child LDLT was made 
by Raia et al. [4] in Brazil in 1988, who described two failed 
cases despite a successful procedure. The first successful LDLT 
adult-child (left lobe) was performed in 1989 in Brisbane, 
Australia to overcome the lack of suitable grafts for pediatric 
recipients [5]. 
The technique was then extended to adult recipients (1993: 
first successful adult-adult LDLT using a left liver lobe [6]; 
1996: first adult-adult LDLT from a right liver lobe [7]) in order 
to solve the shortage of deceased donor grafts and provide a 
source of grafts in countries where the recovery of deceased

donor organs was not possible for organizational or cultural 
reasons. Using a living donor graft presents several advantages: 
the programmed and controlled intervention at an optimum 
time for the recipient, the shorter cold ischemia time and the 
procurement of a living donor graft with predefined anatomical 
features and, more importantly, of optimal quality. 
The main hindrance in the development of adult-adult 
LDLT is the risk of morbidity and mortality for donors, which 
raises legitimate ethical questions [8]. These ethical issues have 
been carefully considered and discussed by Singer et al. [9], 
who proposed the criteria by which donors and recipients 
should be selected. Because of the risks, this technique remains 
marginal, accounting only for 1% of all transplants performed 
in France currently (14 LDLT including 3 for adult recipients) 
(Table II). While there was only one center that performed adult 
LDLT in 1997 in the USA, this number has gradually increased 
to 38 centers in 2000. The number of adult-to-adult LDLT 
performed per year increased until the death of a liver donor 
in 2002 sparked a media furor that seriously compromised 
the pursuit of LDLT programs in the U.S. and significantly 
decreased the use of this procedure in the following years [10]. 
The aims of our study were to review the series dealing with 
morbidity and mortality in LDLT and to identify the strategies 
proposed in the literature for developing LDLT.
SEARCH STRATEGY
We conducted a systematic literature review in order to 
evaluate the morbidity and mortality of the donor in LDLT, 
and to assess the new strategies developed to increase LDLT 
practice.
A computerized search was made using the Medline 
database from January 2000 to 2017. Data sources were English￾language reports on donor outcome after LDLT. Two searches 
were conducted: the MeSH terms “liver transplantation” and 
“morbidity” in combination with keyword “living donor liver 
transplantation” yielded 138 hits. The MeSH terms “liver 
transplantation” and “mortality” in combination with keyword 
“living donor liver transplantation” led to 267 hits. References 
of retrieved articles were cross-checked to identify additional 
reports. We excluded duplicate articles and obtained 382 
articles about morbidity and/or mortality. Abstracts of relevant

articles were reviewed independently using predetermined 
criteria, and appropriate articles were retrieved: abstracts with 
no relevance, no personal data, no information about donors 
or with already published data were excluded. For morbidity 
studies, we only included studies using the validated 5-tier 
Clavien grading [11]. Finally, we obtained 43 appropriate 
articles about morbidity, 15 about mortality and 6 regarding 
morbidity and mortality (Fig. 1). The study design and results 
are summarized in Tables III and IV.
MORTALITY
According to our search strategy, we identified 21 
original articles regarding the mortality of living donors after 
hepatectomy (Fig. 1). These studies included 23 patients who 
died after hepatectomy for donation, between 1999 and 2017. 
Table III summarizes all living donor deaths after right living 
donor donation documented by at least one publication. The 
major cause of death was postoperative sepsis: 7/23 (30%) of 
donor deaths.
Although the mortality after right hepatectomy for 
donation is low (0.3 to 0.5 %), death of a donor remains a 
tragedy for the families and transplant teams [2, 12, 13]. In 
2006, the team of Paul Brousse Hospital published an opinion 
survey of health professionals (surgeons, physicians, nurses, 
aides and secretaries) on LDLT among adults from the same 
family [14]. In this series, the acceptable mortality rate for the 
donor was around 4%, except among internists (0.7%). These 
rates were all higher than the actual mortality rates reported 
in the literature (Table IV). The authors concluded that the 
psychological involvement of transplant teams, although very 
strong in these conditions, should not be an obstacle to the 
development of this technique. In 2006, Trotter et al. [15] 
collected data on all deaths after hepatectomy for donation. 
Of the 4,598 LDLT in the United States and Europe, 13 donor 
deaths and 1 permanent vegetative state were directly related 
to the surgery. Among the deceased donors, 9 had a right 
lobectomy, while a single donor had a left lobectomy. For 3 
patients, the lobe removed was unspecified. In 2008, Ringe 
et al. [13] compiled all cases of death reported or known 
in the world (publications, conferences, communications, 
personal conversations). This study identified 33 liver 
donor deaths including 3 after rescue transplantation; only 
12 deaths were published in detail. The risk of death was 
directly proportional to the quantity of parenchyma resected: 
this mortality rate was up to 0.5% after right hepatectomy 
and from 0.1 to 0.3% after left hepatectomy. These results 
were confirmed by a series focused on right hepatectomy 
for tumors. In 2007, Truant et al. [3] reported the results of 
31 extended right hepatectomies in non-cirrhotic liver, and 
concluded that the ratio of remnant liver volume to body 
weight is more relevant than the ratio of remnant liver volume 
to total liver volume in predicting postoperative liver failure 
and death. Patients with an anticipated remnant liver volume 
of <0.5% of the body weight were at considerable risk for 
postoperative mortality. 
More recently, Muzaale et al. [2] reported the mortality 
rates and hepatocellular insufficiency after donation of part of 
the liver in the United States. Of the 4,111 LDLTs performed 
in the United States between 1994 and 2011, 7 donors died (4

after the removal of the right lobe, 1 of the left liver and 2 of 
the left lobe) and 4 other had liver failure in the postoperative 
period (3 of which required a transplantation). 
Significant progress has been made worldwide since the 
first LDLT, but this technique remains at risk for the donor. We 
identified 23 deaths between 1999 and 2017, and this number 
is probably higher, taking into account unpublished donor 
mortality. Centers with unreported deaths should submit these 
outcomes to the liver transplantation community to provide a 
better estimate of donor death rate. Furthermore, despite our 
research we have not found any recorded donor death after 
2010, which raises the problem of inhomogeneous publication 
of worldwide data.
MORBIDITY
Removal of the right liver from a healthy donor is subject 
to significant morbidity. Indeed, the reported morbidity varied 
from 10% to 78.3% (Table IV). 
In 2002, Beavers et al. [16] compiled all outcome studies 
after donation of the right liver. Of the 211 publications 
dealing with this subject, the authors reported 12 studies with 
detailed results on postoperative complications. The overall 
morbidity rate was 31% (54 events in 174 donors) in this 
report [16]. However, the definition of complications is not 
standardized between different studies, which may lead to an 
underestimation of morbidity. In 2007, Yi et al. [17] reported

The morbidity rate was correlated to the amount of liver 
tissue removed. The reports of the majority of transplant 
centers in Europe, Asia and the United States indicated that 
the rate of post-operative complications is higher after a right 
hepatectomy [18] than after a left hepatectomy especially 
regarding biliary leakage [16, 19-21].
Moreover, some series showed that right hepatectomy for 
donation in high volume centers retains a significant morbidity 
[22]. In 2011, Azoulay et al. [23] reported the largest European 
single center series of hepatectomy for donation straight 
and a comprehensive assessment of complications classified 
according to the Clavien score [11]. In this series, less than 
half of the 91 donors, operated between 2000 and 2009, had a 
complication and a third of these were major complications (≥ 
grade III). It is interesting to note that in this series, as well as in 
other high-volume centers in Asia and the United States, there 
was no improvement in overall morbidity over time [2, 23-25].
Recently, Belghiti et al. [26] reported the results of a case￾control study comparing the effects of right hepatectomy in 
a living donor with those of a right hepatectomy for benign 
tumors that may explain this stable morbidity. The authors 
underlined that the complication rate was superior in a right 
hepatectomy for donation than for benign tumors. They 
concluded that living donor right hepatectomy caused a more 
severe loss of liver volume than right hepatectomy for benign 
tumors and that the liver regeneration effort remaining after 
hepatectomy was so important that it could have explained 
a greater vulnerability to postoperative complications. To 
measure and define the best achievable outcome after major 
hepatectomy, Rossler et al. [27] in 2016 proposed the analysis of 
a multicentric international series of 5202 hemi-hepatectomies 
from living donor. Indeed, analysis in living liver donors, with 
safety as the highest priority, offers the opportunity to define 
outcome benchmarks as the best possible results. Endpoints 
included postoperative morbidity measured by the Clavien￾Dindo classification, the Comprehensive Complication Index 
(CCI), and liver failure according to different definitions. 
They reported that 12% of patients developed at least 1 
complication: of these, 3.8% were major events (grade III, 
including 1 death), mostly related to biliary/bleeding events, 
and were twice higher after right hepatectomy. Lee et al. 
[28] recently reviewed prospectively collected data from the 
Korean Organ Transplantation Registry of all 832 live liver 
donors who underwent procedures between April 2014 and 
December 2015. They reported no deaths after living liver 
donation and overall, biliary and major complication (grade 
≥ III) rates were 9.3%, 1.7% and 1.9%, respectively. Based on 
this literature review, the right liver removal in the living donor 
was burdened with significant morbidity even in experienced 
surgical teams [28]. The mortality of this procedure (which 
remains a major hepatic resection) cannot be reduced below 
0.3% [2]. The decrease in morbidity and mortality in LDLT 
donors remains an important issue in the development of this 
technique in order to meet ethical requirements.

Beyond morbidity and mortality, the quality of life (QoL) 
of the donor after donation must also be considered. Indeed, 
living donors achieve no medical benefits and are exposed to 
the risk of major complications. Surprisingly, several studies 
showed that the QoL of donors was similar or even better than 
the reference population before donation [29]. The Physical 
Component Score decreased immediately after donation, 
then returned to baseline within 6 to 12 months, while the 
Mental Component Score remained comparable to that of 
normative population throughout the procedure [30]. In a 
study involving 19 living donors, Parolin et al. [31] showed that 
the donor’s relationship to the recipient and to their families 
was improved after donation in all cases. Moreover, Bhatti et al. 
[32] showed that acceptable post-donation QoL was achieved 
and no significant difference in scores was observed between 
donors with and without surgical complications. This report 
is similar with those of Beavers et al. [33], who reported that 
regardless of recipient outcome, 100% of donors would donate 
again and of Chang et al. [34] who reported that 87% of donors 
showed a willingness to re-donate. In contrast, Kousoulas et 
al. [35] reported that donors did not regret their decision to 
donate but development of postoperative donor complications 
and the postoperative recipient mortality had a negative effect 
on the Health-related QoL of donors. Evaluation of anxiety 
and depression 3 months after donation found no difference 
between donors and controls [36]. Psychiatric complications 
were found in 4.1% of donors in an Adult to Adult living 
donor liver transplantation study [37]. Among the 23 donor 
deaths described in the literature, 4 were due to suicide, raising 
questions about the donors QoL as well as their psychological 
follow-up after donation [15, 37]. 
HOW TO REDUCE MORBIDITY AND 
MORTALITY IN LIVING DONORS?
To balance both a reduction of the risk for donors and to 
improve the outcome of the recipient, many strategies have 
been proposed. We have divided these different strategies into 
two groups: those aimed at reducing the amount of parenchyma 
harvested in the donor and those aimed at increasing the donor 
future remnant liver before the hepatectomy.
Reducing the amount of parenchyma harvested in the 
donor
These strategies comprised the limitation of the amount 
of parenchyma harvested in the donor and the control of the 
small for size syndrome (SFSS) risk in the recipient.
Operative strategies
To avoid the right lobe donor risks, some teams started to 
use left lobe donation in adult patients. This procedure was 
first described by Hashikura in 1994 [6]. However, after the 
first successful graft, Tanaka et al. [38] reported in their early 
series of left lobe (LL) LDLT an 82.1% survival in patients with a 
graft to recipient weight ratio >0.8 but only 54.5% in those with 
a ratio <0.8. Furthermore, Kiuchi et al. [39] revealed inferior 
graft survival rates for smaller grafts which dropped off the 
LL graft development. Soejima et al. [40, 41] performed large 
single center studies which showed that the outcomes of LL 
LDLT were comparable with those of RL LDLT, although SFSS 
occurred more often in LL LDLT [2, 3]. To manage SFSS, they 
developed a specific approach to avoid excessive portal flow

in the graft using hemi porto-caval shunt and splenectomy. 
They concluded that LL grafts should be considered as the first 
procedure except for patients with MELD score >30. 
In order to deal with SFSS, dual graft LDLT was also 
introduced to obtain combined graft sufficiency. Xu et al. [42] 
reported 367 patients worldwide in 2015 and concluded that 
dual graft LDLT should be prudently performed in selected 
cases by surgeons of proven expertise when a single donation is 
unacceptable and a second living donor is available. However, 
the decision-making criteria need to be standardized and 
ethical concerns about involving a second living donor need 
to be addressed [42]. 
Pharmacological treatment of SFSS
A variety of experimental pharmacological treatment 
strategies have been described for the prevention of SFSS, based 
on the attenuation of portal shear stress and the enhancement 
of liver regeneration. The modulation of prostaglandin E1, 
nitric oxide, endothelin receptor A, adenosine 2A receptor, 
has been tested in animal models [43]. In 2016, Mohkam et 
al. [44] demonstrated the preventive effect of somatostatin by 
decreasing portal vein flow in a porcine model of SFSS [44]. 
Similar results were demonstrated in 90% of hepatectomized 
murine models using octreotide infusion [45]. Treatment of 
SFSS by somatostatin and propranolol has also been clinically 
tested and resulted in a favorable outcome [46].
Increasing the donor future remnant liver before the 
hepatectomy
Pharmacological preconditioning
In 2005, Malik et al. [47] proposed in an experimental study 
the administration of thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine, 
T3) to the donor rats, 10 days before hepatectomy (70% and 
90% hepatectomy). The authors reported that the injection 
of T3 (bolus 4mg/kg) in rats was responsible for a trigger of 
hepatic regeneration and increased liver weight/body weight 
on day 10 associated with an increase in total liver volume. 
The 70% hepatectomy, 10 days after the preconditioning 
(T3), left in place a remnant liver volume larger than in 
non-pre-conditioned animals. After 90% hepatectomy, 
the preconditioned animals had better survival than non￾preconditioned (57% vs. 14%). However, the T3 injected doses 
were almost 2000 times the maximum dose in humans treated 
for thyroid insufficiency [48]. Despite these interesting results 
in terms of liver regeneration, it seems difficult to apply this 
preconditioning to humans considering the consequences, 
including cardiac, of an overdose of thyroid hormones.
Portal flow modulation in donors
Ischemic preconditioning by clamping the right pedicle 
for 10 minutes before living donation has been proposed to 
decrease the ischemia-reperfusion injury [49, 50]. Despite 
the involvement of anti-apoptotic molecular mechanisms, 
the authors did not report any clinical benefit in the donor 
or recipient.
Portal vein embolization is used in liver tumor treatment 
prior to major hepatectomy. The aim of this technique is 
to induce the atrophy of the ipsilateral liver and thus the 
hypertrophy of the future remnant liver before hepatectomy. 
Based on these results, some teams have developed reversible 
portal vein embolization to avoid liver atrophy [51-53]. 
Nevertheless, reversible portal vein embolization failed to 
reduce liver atrophy and therefore, this technique cannot be 
used for living donor liver preconditioning [53].
Khan et al. [54] studied the effects of partial portal vein 
ligation 8 weeks prior to hepatectomy on a murine model 
of partial hepatectomy. They observed that partial portal 
vein ligation prior to hepatectomy did not impair hepatic 
regeneration capacity, compared to sham animals. 
Gregoire et al. recently identified that 20% stenosis of the 
portal vein of a hemi-liver in pigs induced a contralateral 
hypertrophy without atrophy of the ipsilateral liver [55]. This 
procedure might be an effective donor preconditioning in 
order to achieve a larger remnant liver in living donor without 
altering the future graft. Indeed, the 20% stenosis of the portal 
vein of a hemi-liver triggered the liver regeneration in the 
contralateral lobe (the future remnant liver of the donor) with 
cell proliferation equivalent to that observed after ligation or 
embolization of the portal vein. 
CONCLUSIONS
Morbidity, mortality and donor QoL remain a major 
hindrance to the development of LDLT. 
Donor morbidity and mortality are inevitable given the 
ultra-major nature of the donor operation, which is why the 
most serious ethical concerns in LDLT focus on the risks to 
the donor and relate to the principle of ‘do no harm’. However, 
the state of research on the preconditioning of the donor 
allows an improvement in these parameters to be considered 
in the future, including donor preconditioning techniques 
(absorbable portal embolization, portal stenosis) and the use 
of the left liver associated with portal flow modulation in the 
recipient (portal banding).
Moreover, these techniques could represent a hope for 
countries in which LDLT is the only source of graft for 
organizational or cultural reasons.
