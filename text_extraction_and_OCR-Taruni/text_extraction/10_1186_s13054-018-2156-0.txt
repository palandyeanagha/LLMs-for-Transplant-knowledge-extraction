Abstract
Background: Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is a severe complication of cirrhosis and is defined by organ
failure and high rates of short-term mortality. Patients with ACLF are managed with multiorgan support in the
intensive care unit (ICU). Currently, it is unclear when this supportive care becomes futile, particularly in patients
who are not candidates for liver transplant. The aim of this study was to determine whether the currently available
prognostic scores can identify patients with ACLF in whom prolonged ICU care is likely to be futile despite maximal
treatment efforts.
Methods: Data of 202 consecutive patients with ACLF admitted to the ICU at the Royal Free Hospital London between
2005 and 2012 were retrospectively analyzed. Prognostic scores for chronic liver diseases, such as Child-Pugh, Model
for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD), European Foundation for the study of chronic liver failure (CLIF-C) organ
failure (OF), and CLIF-C ACLF, were calculated 48 hours after ICU admission and correlated with patient outcome
after 28 days.
Results: The CLIF-C ACLF score, compared with all other scores, most accurately predicted 28-day mortality, with
an area under the receiver operator characteristic of 0.8 (CLIF-C OF, 0.75; MELD, 0.68; Child-Pugh, 0.66). A CLIF-C
ACLF score cutoff ≥ 70 identified patients with a 100% mortality within 28 days. These patients had elevated inflammatory
parameters representing a systemic inflammatory response, most often renal failure, compared with patients below this
cutoff.
Conclusions: Patients with ACLF and high CLIF-C ACLF score (≥ 70) after 48 hours of intensive care may reach a threshold
of futility for further ongoing intensive support. The best treatment options in this scenario remain to be determined but
may include palliative care.

Background
Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is a syndrome that
develops in patients with an acute decompensation of liver
cirrhosis and is characterized by development of organ
failure and high short-term mortality [1]. The diagnostic
criteria for organ failure and subsequent ACLF gradation
are based on the European Foundation for the study of
chronic liver failure (CLIF) organ failure score (CLIF-OF
score), a modified version of the Sequential Organ Failure
Assessment (SOFA) score [1, 2]. Depending on the ACLF
grade, 28-day mortality ranges from 23.3% in ACLF grade
1 to 75.5% in ACLF grade 3 [1], and most patients require
intensive care and organ support [3, 4].
In order to prognosticate mortality in patients with
ACLF more accurately, the CLIF consortium derived
and validated a new score, the CLIF-C ACLF score [2].
The CLIF-C ACLF score combines CLIF-OF score with
patients’ age and white blood cell (WBC) count to gen￾erate a composite score of 0–100 in a linear range. Val￾idation in an external prospective cohort showed that
this score was significantly more accurate than
Child-Pugh score, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease
(MELD) score, and MELD with serum sodium score in
predicting 28-day mortality in ACLF [2]. CLIF-C ACLF
score predicted short-term mortality 25% better than all
listed scores [2]. The 28-day mortality varied from below
20% in CLIF-C ACLF score < 45 to more than 80% in
CLIF-C ACLF score ≥ 65 [2].
The utility of CLIF-C ACLF score in patients with
ACLF grade 3, and specifically CLIF-C ACLF score > 64,
has been discussed [5, 6] because these patients may still
have a poor prognosis in spite of maximal treatment
efforts and the associated high costs. Validating the
CLIF-C ACLF score on the dataset of the CANONIC
(EASL-CLIF Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure in Cirrho￾sis) study has shown that in a subset of patients with
four or more organ failures and/or CLIF-C ACLF
score ≥ 65, 3–7 days after ACLF diagnosis, mortality
rates were 100%. Single-center experiences in a small
subset of such patients with ACLF (n = 23) presented by
Cardoso et al. [6] supported this notion, albeit that mor￾tality in this cohort was lower at 86% after 90 days [5].
As a consequence, it has been suggested that intensive
care support could be withdrawn in patients with this
severity of disease. However, because the available data
to support this notion are restricted to the CANONIC
cohort and one small, single-center, study, further valid￾ation is required before this can be considered for trans￾lation into clinical practice.
In this study, we aimed to evaluate the short-term out￾come of patients with ACLF and compared the predictive
value of the CLIF-C ACLF score against other prognostic
scores and clinical variables 48 hours after full intensive
care support and regardless of when ACLF was first
diagnosed. We also aimed to determine whether the
CLIF-C ACLF score could be used to define the futility of
ongoing intensive care unit (ICU) support.
Methods
Patients and study design
In this retrospective single-center study, data of 202 con￾secutive patients with ACLF admitted to the ICU at the
Royal Free Hospital London were analyzed. All patients
received organ system support, including mechanical
ventilation, renal replacement therapy, and vasopressor
support as required. All parameters at 48 hours of ICU
admission were used to diagnose ACLF and to calculate
prognostic scores. The parameters included demo￾graphic and biological variables and the number of
organs that failed. Data for this study were obtained
through archived patient notes, collected between 2005
and 2012 in the hospital, and the follow-up data 28 days
after ICU admission were retrieved through a combin￾ation of the follow-up clinic notes, patients’ general phy￾sicians, and direct telephone contact with patients
themselves. This database is updated at regular intervals,
and some of the patients have previously been analyzed
to determine predisposing factors leading to ACLF [7]
for use as the validation cohort for the CLIF-C ACLF
study [2] and to clarify the role of ammonia, inflamma￾tion, and oxygenation in brain dysfunction in ACLF [8].
Diagnostic criteria for ACLF and management
Criteria for the diagnosis of ACLF was made using the
CLIF-OF classification, which is a modification of the
CLIF-C SOFA score [1, 2]. Organ failures were defined
as follows according to the method of Moreau et al. [1]:
renal failure as serum creatinine ≥ 2 mg/dl and/or re￾quirement for renal replacement therapy; brain failure as
hepatic encephalopathy graded III/IV according to the
West Haven Criteria; liver failure, defined as bilirubin ≥
12 mg/dl; coagulation failure as international normalized
ratio (INR) ≥ 2.5; circulation failure, defined as treatment
with vasoconstrictors to maintain the arterial blood pres￾sure or to increase the cardiac output; and lung failure
as a partial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxy￾gen ratio ≤ 200 or peripheral capillary oxygen saturation/
fraction of inspired oxygen ratio ≤ 214. ACLF grade 1
was defined by the presence of single kidney failure or
any other organ failure when in combination with either
renal insufficiency (serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dl) or
hepatic encephalopathy grade 1/2. The ACLF grade 2 or
3 was defined by the presence of two or at least three
organ failures, respectively.
Prognostic score calculation
The CLIF-C ACLF score was calculated by combining
the CLIF-C OF score, age, and WBC count with the
Engelmann et al. Critical Care (2018) 22:254 Page 2 of 8

following formula: CLIF-C ACLF = 10 × (0.33 × CLI￾F-OFs + 0.04 x Age + 0.63 × ln(WBC count) − 2 [2]. The
MELD score and Child-Pugh score were calculated as
described previously [9]. The systemic inflammatory
response syndrome (SIRS) score expressed the number
of SIRS criteria components that were fulfilled.
Statistics
Variables were tested for a normal distribution using
quantile-quantile plots and histograms. Differences in nor￾mally distributed continuous variables were evaluated by
Student’s t test, whereas variables showing skewed distribu￾tions with variance heterogeneity were evaluated by the
Mann-Whitney U test. Pearson χ2 test was used to compare
categorical variables. The accuracy of the CLIF-C ACLF
score in predicting survival was assessed by calculating the
area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC)
curve. A cutoff value was chosen to accurately predict fatal￾ities with a high specificity. Survival analysis was performed
according to the CLIF-ACLF cutoff values by using
Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank test for group compari￾son. Because only one patient was transplanted in the
whole cohort, this event was not considered to be a com￾peting risk. Univariate analysis was carried out to identify
the baseline factors associated with occurrence of death
(see Additional file 1). A multivariate Cox regression model
was then fitted individually for each prognostic score with
identified potentially confounders of death (p < 0.2) in this
cohort. All potential confounders that were part of predict￾ive score calculations (MELD, Child-Pugh, CLIF-C ACLF)
were not included in the multivariate model. Patients lost
to follow-up were censored at the time of last patient

Results
Clinical characteristics of patients
Of the 202 patients included in the study, 99 died within
28 days and 1 was transplanted. In relation to deaths
within 48 hours, of the 202 patients included in the
study, 9 ACLF grade 3 and 6 ACLF grades 1 + 2 patients
died just within this time point, albeit that their retro￾spective ACLF score classifications were based on the
last available data points premortem.
Whereas bilirubin levels (3.4 mg/dl vs. 7.8 mg/dl,
p < 0.001), INR (1.8 vs. 2.2, p < 0.0001), and serum
creatinine (0.9 mg/dl vs. 1.5 mg/dl, p = 0.002) were
higher in patients who died, the sodium level,
platelet count, albumin level, and WBC count were
not different between survivors and nonsurvivors. Of
the patients who survived, 26 (25%) were treated
with renal replacement therapy, whereas 41 (41%) (p
= 0.02) of the nonsurvivors received this therapy.
The gender distribution, age, and prevalence of hep￾atic encephalopathy were similar in both groups. Pa￾tients who died more often had a higher number of organ
failures than the survivors (4–6 organ failures, survivors
2% vs. nonsurvivors 22%, p < 0.0001). The same applied to
the CLIF-OF score, which was higher in nonsurvivors
(median, 13 [11–14] vs. 11 [9–12]; p < 0.0001). All prog￾nostic scores, defining the severity of liver dysfunction,
were markedly increased in nonsurvivors. MELD score
was 30 ± 10 in nonsurvivors compared with 23 ± 9 in sur￾vivors (p < 0.0001). In total, 92% of nonsurvivors and 71%
of survivors (p < 0.0001) had Child-Pugh grade C. The
CLIF-C ACLF score of 58.4 ± 9.6 was also statistically

higher in patients who died, compared with 50.6 ± 7.3 in
survivors (p < 0.0001) (Table 1, Fig. 1).
Predictors of 28-day mortality
All prognostic scores were tested individually with signifi￾cant confounders in a Cox regression analysis to assess
and compare their respective predictive abilities. Univari￾ate analysis was carried out to identify potential predictors
of 28-day mortality in a univariate Cox regression model
(see Additional file 1). Variables that were included in the
score calculations were not considered for this analysis.
Results disclosed CLIF-C ACLF score (HR = 1.07; 95% CI
1.05–1.09; p < 0.0001), the Child-Pugh score (HR = 1.35;
95% CI 1.20–1.53; p < 0.0001), and the MELD score (HR
= 1.05; 95% CI 1.03–1.07; p < 0.0001) as the independent
predictors of 28-day mortality (Table 2).
Predictors of mortality in ACLF grade 3
Because a previous study [5] has shown that patients
with three or more organ failures incur high mortality,
further analyses were conducted in patients with ACLF
severity grade 3, which is defined by the presence of
three or more organ failures [2]. The 28-day mortality in
ACLF grade 3 was 72% (49 of 68), and none were trans￾planted. ROC analysis of all prognostic parameters that
were significant upon univariate analysis revealed that
the CLIF-C ACLF score had an AUROC of 0.80 (95% CI
0.69–0.91) for predicting 28-day mortality in ACLF
grade 3 and was superior to MELD score, CLIF-C OF
score, and Child-Pugh score (Fig. 2).
Survival analysis in ACLF grade 3 according to CLIF-C
ACLF score
According to the ROC analysis, we depicted different
thresholds for the CLIF-C ACLF score to assess their
utility in predicting outcome in ACLF 3 patients
(Table 3). Applying various thresholds for ACLF score in
this population managed in the ICU, it is apparent that
28-day mortality varies from 80% in those with ACLF
score ≥ 55 up to 100% in those with ACLF scores ≥ 70.
Indeed, the highest specificity for determining 28-day
mortality was seen with an ACLF score ≥ 70. Patients
with a CLIF-C ACLF score below the threshold of 70 had
a mortality of only 64% (34 of 53), which was significantly
lower than in patients with ACLF score ≥ 70 (p = 0.006)
(Fig. 3). The patients with ACLF grade 3 and ACLF
score ≥ 70 were significantly older and had a higher num￾ber of organ failures. Parameters reflecting an inflamma￾tory response (SIRS, WBC count) were also more elevated
compared with patients below this cutoff (Table 4). Pa￾tients with CLIF-C ACLF score ≥ 70 incurred more renal
failure (93.3% vs. 66%, p = 0.038; renal replacement 53%
vs. 73%, p = 0.16) and a trend toward circulatory failure
(87% vs. 62%; p = 0.07), whereas all other types of organ
failure did not differ from CLIF-C ACLF score < 70
(Table 4).
Discussion
The data presented in this study suggest the CLIF-C ACLF
score is the most accurate in predicting short-term (28-day)
mortality for patients with ACLF compared with all other
tested prognostic scores for chronic liver disease in patients
with ACLF, especially for ACLF grade 3. We identified dif￾ferent thresholds of CLIF-C ACLF score to predict
short-term mortality, and in order to maximize specificity
around a threshold that would inform very high mortality
and thereby question the benefit of ongoing ICU supportive
care, further analyses were performed using a CLIF-C
ACLF score cutoff ≥ 70. Applying a CLIF-C ACLF score
cutoff ≥ 70 had 100% specificity for predicting mortality

such that all patients above this threshold died within
28 days after ICU admission, despite maximal treatment ef￾forts, including full organ support as per standard of care
in our tertiary center. Maximal supportive treatment was
provided up to the point that death was thought to be
imminent. Despite the relatively limited number of patients
with CLIF-C ACLF ≥ 70 (n = 15), our data suggest that
ongoing intensive care support in these patients, in the ab￾sence of liver transplant, may be futile, given no improve￾ment despite full organ support as needed for 48 hours.
Our data are in line with previous reports showing a very
poor prognosis in similar cohorts of at-risk patients, in
whom dynamic assessments of change in CLIF-C ACLF
score showed that those with further progression of ACLF
grade or failed improvement had high mortality [5, 6]. The
best management options in this scenario, given currently
available limited therapies, require further evaluation,
including the need for palliative care pathways.
The time point at which patients’ prognosis is assessed
seems to be key. Our data suggest that mortality was
relatively low (approximately 35–40%) within the first
week after intensive treatment unit (ITU) admission, but
beyond this, all remaining patients died quickly (within
2 weeks). This might imply that patients with CLIF-C
ACLF ≥ 70 may have limited reserve and regenerative
capacity, even if receiving full intervention support for
the initial precipitating event. Moreover, the short sur￾vival period is an argument that either palliative care or,
if eligible, liver transplant [10–12] should be discussed
early after assessing the response to intensive care ther￾apy for 48 hours, because the time until death and the
window for intervention is very short thereafter.

Liver transplant in so-called high-MELD patients is
highly debated because it is associated with significant
posttransplant morbidity [13, 14]. Importantly, in our
center, transplant selection aims at > 90% one-year sur￾vival, which necessitates the exclusion of urgently listing
patients with decompensation or ACLF. However, there
are data to suggest that overall survival can be in excess of
80% and comparable to patients transplanted without
ACLF [12], which is also substantiated in other studies, in￾cluding studies of living donor liver recipients [10, 15, 16].
By contrast, a retrospective study by Levesque et al.
showed in a subgroup of 30 patients with ACLF grade 3 a
12-month survival rate of 43% after cadaveric liver trans￾plant [11]. These studies clearly highlight that although it
is worthwhile discussing liver transplant in ACLF grade 3,
this must be tempered by assessment of factors that may
indicate worse outcome after liver transplant, such as in￾fections, age, and presence of hepatocellular carcinoma, as
proposed by Levesque et al. [11]. In addition, patients
through debilitation of their advanced liver disease and a
continued severe inflammatory state, as seen with ACLF,
would be expected to be frail and may not be rescued by
liver transplant [17].
To date, interventions such as extracorporeal liver
support, such as the trials with MARS (molecular ad￾sorbent recirculation system) [18, 19], have failed to
show any clear survival benefit in ACLF 3. When under￾taking consideration for such interventions in such an
advanced disease cohort, appropriate resource allocation
and effectiveness of the intervention must remain major
considerations for implementation. Until there are new
interventions with proven efficacy, futility of ongoing
intensive care support should be discussed early, also
taking into consideration that cirrhosis and ACLF repre￾sent an increasing health and socioeconomic burden
[20]. Such early decision-making processes help facilitate
an appropriate and adequate palliative care option in a
cohort in whom mortality is high, despite maximal in￾tensive treatment support.
It is important to note that a CLIF-C ACLF score ≥ 70
was associated with distinct clinical features. Notably, the
SIRS score and WBC count, which are reflective of an in￾flammatory response, were significantly higher in those with
ACLF score ≥ 70, albeit that infections as specific precipitat￾ing events were not overrepresented and patients received
antibiotic treatment as part of the standard procedure. This
in line with the assertion that increasing disease severity in
ACLF is accompanied by a systemic inflammatory response.
Claria et al. [21] and others have shown that proinflamma￾tory cytokines increase throughout the different severity
grades of ACLF and that such inflammation is associated
with higher mortality [22–24]. This may imply that strat￾egies to lower inflammation and thereby risk of new infec￾tion, such as gut decontamination, may improve outcomes,
but further clinical trials of such interventions are needed.
Moreover, it remains to be seen whether these strategies are
cost-effective in such sick patients.
There are some limitations of this study that need
consideration. First, this study is a retrospective analysis of
prospectively gathered data, which may be regarded as a
weakness because some potential contributory factors that
might influence outcome may not have been assessed at
the time of enrollment. Second, a further potential limita￾tion of this study is that the response to supportive ther￾apy in the ICU was evaluated at 48 hours and not beyond.
The previously reported outcomes in ACLF grade 3
patients in the CANONIC study by Gustot et al. showed
that assessment of CLIF-C ACLF score between days 3
and 7 and a change in score determined longer-term
outcome. This supports the idea of repeated assessments
to define futility in such patients, in whom a fixed time of
assessment may sometimes be difficult [5].
Conclusions
Patients with ACLF who require intensive care support￾ive treatment should be assessed early after ITU admis￾sion using the CLIF-C ACLF score. In patients with
ACLF 3 and a CLIF-C ACLF score ≥ 70, who are not
suitable for liver transplant, futility of continued cur￾rently available intensive supportive therapy should be
considered. The best treatment options in this scenario
remain to be determined but may include palliative care.
