Abstract
Background: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a common and costly condition to treat. Economic evaluations of health care
often incorporate patient preferences for health outcomes using utilities. The objective of this study was to determine
pooled utility-based quality of life (the numerical value attached to the strength of an individual’s preference for a specific
health outcome) by CKD treatment modality.
Methods and Findings: We conducted a systematic review, meta-analysis, and meta-regression of peer-reviewed published
articles and of PhD dissertations published through 1 December 2010 that reported utility-based quality of life (utility) for
adults with late-stage CKD. Studies reporting utilities by proxy (e.g., reported by a patient’s doctor or family member) were
excluded. In total, 190 studies reporting 326 utilities from over 56,000 patients were analysed. There were 25 utilities from
pre-treatment CKD patients, 226 from dialysis patients (haemodialysis, n = 163; peritoneal dialysis, n = 44), 66 from kidney
transplant patients, and three from patients treated with non-dialytic conservative care. Using time tradeoff as a referent
instrument, kidney transplant recipients had a mean utility of 0.82 (95% CI: 0.74, 0.90). The mean utility was comparable in
pre-treatment CKD patients (difference = 20.02; 95% CI: 20.09, 0.04), 0.11 lower in dialysis patients (95% CI: 20.15, 20.08),
and 0.2 lower in conservative care patients (95% CI: 20.38, 20.01). Patients treated with automated peritoneal dialysis had a
significantly higher mean utility (0.80) than those on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (0.72; p = 0.02). The mean
utility of transplant patients increased over time, from 0.66 in the 1980s to 0.85 in the 2000s, an increase of 0.19 (95% CI:
0.11, 0.26). Utility varied by elicitation instrument, with standard gamble producing the highest estimates, and the SF-6D by
Brazier et al., University of Sheffield, producing the lowest estimates. The main limitations of this study were that treatment
assignments were not random, that only transplant had longitudinal data available, and that we calculated EuroQol Group
EQ-5D scores from SF-36 and SF-12 health survey data, and therefore the algorithms may not reflect EQ-5D scores measured
directly.
Conclusions: For patients with late-stage CKD, treatment with dialysis is associated with a significant decrement in quality
of life compared to treatment with kidney transplantation. These findings provide evidence-based utility estimates to
inform economic evaluations of kidney therapies, useful for policy makers and in individual treatment discussions with CKD
patients.

Introduction
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a common and costly
condition to treat. In the United States in 2009, 7%–8% of the
total population, around 23 million people, had CKD [1]. Of
those, 570,000 were treated with dialysis or kidney transplantation
[1]. In the United Kingdom there are an estimated 140,000
individuals with CKD under the care of a nephrologist [2], and an
additional 50,000 who are treated with dialysis or kidney
transplantation [3,4]. In France, over 38,000 people in 16 of its
26 regions are treated with dialysis or kidney transplantation [4].
Similarly, in 12 of Italy’s 20 regions almost 34,000 individuals rely
on dialysis or kidney transplantation for survival [4]. CKD has an
enormous impact on an individual’s quality of life, and interven￾tions like dialysis can influence this in either a positive or a
negative direction. Quality of life estimates (utilities) are important
for economic evaluations, as quality of life is a key component of
economic benefit. Quality-adjusted life years are a measure of a
person’s length of life weighted by a valuation of their health￾related quality of life over that period. Quality-adjusted life years
are the preferred outcome in cost-effectiveness studies and enable
direct comparisons to be made between treatment alternatives.
Utilities are the numerical value attached to the strength of an
individual’s preference for specific health-related outcomes. Utility
is measured on a 0 to 1 scale, where 0 represents death and 1
represents full health [5]. It has been suggested that 0.03 is the
minimum clinically important difference in utility [6], and this
definition is applied in this study within the context of CKD.
Utilities from single studies may not always be a reliable indicator
of underlying quality of life, particularly where quality of life is not
the main focus of the study but where quality of life data are
collected as part of a broad set of study outcomes. Meta-analyses,
on the other hand, have the advantage of combining all published
data for a given population, potentially yielding more accurate
utility estimates, as well as providing insight into the factors that
influence quality of life.
From prior meta-analyses, it is known that utilities are lower in
people with CKD than in those without kidney disease, and also
that people with a functioning kidney transplant have higher
utilities than people on dialysis [7,8]. It is unclear how the type of
dialysis impacts utility estimates, or how individuals who choose
not to commence dialysis rate their quality of life. The need for
greater understanding of outcomes for patients with end-stage
kidney disease who forgo dialysis and are managed conservatively
has been highlighted in the most recent annual report from the
UK Renal Registry and in the US Renal Physicians Association’s
clinical practice guidelines on shared decision making in the
appropriate initiation of, and withdrawal from, dialysis [3,9].
Utility can be measured by a number of alternative approaches,
using direct methods (such as time tradeoff and standard gamble)
or multi-attribute utility instruments, such as the Australian
Assessment of Quality of Life (http://www.aqol.com.au), the
EuroQol Group’s EQ-5D (http://www.euroqol.org), the UK’s SF￾6D (http://www.shef.ac.uk/scharr/sections/heds/mvh/sf-6d), the
15D from Finland (http://www.15d-instrument.net/15d), and the
Health Utilities Index version 2 or 3 from Health Utilities (http://
www.healthutilities.com) [5]. In addition, data from non-utility￾based quality of life instruments such as the commonly used SF-36
health survey and the SF-12 health survey can be converted to a
utility using published transformation algorithms [10,11]. Using
these algorithms allowed us to generate a more comprehensive
meta-analysis than previously possible. The purpose of this study
was to systematically review and determine pooled utility-based
quality of life for CKD by treatment type.
Methods
Study Selection
This systematic review follows PRISMA guidelines (Text S1).
We included all electronically available, peer-reviewed articles and
PhD dissertations (herein referred to as studies) of any design. We
included studies in languages other than English if they provided
an English abstract. Abstracts for which a full study was not
available (e.g., conference abstracts) were included if sufficient data
for analysis were provided. No studies were excluded on the basis
of sample size. Opinion pieces/editorials, meta-analyses, and
systematic reviews were excluded. Studies were also excluded if
they reported utilities from proxies (e.g., reported by a doctor or
family member).
Participants. Studies were included if their sample popula￾tion had stage 3, 4, or 5 CKD and were pre-dialysis, on a
recognised form of kidney replacement therapy (haemodialysis,
peritoneal dialysis, or kidney transplantation), or had chosen
supportive non-dialytic therapy (also known as conservative care).
Kidney disease staging was performed by each study and was not
changed for our analysis. Pre-treatment CKD was defined as stage
3–5 CKD patients who did not yet require a form of kidney
replacement therapy. All patients in included studies were 18 y of
age or older. Studies of patients with acute kidney injury or who
had received a combined pancreas-kidney transplant were
excluded.
Utility-based quality of life. We included all studies that
either reported utilities directly or where utilities could be
calculated from SF-36 or SF-12 health surveys using a peer￾reviewed algorithm [10,11]. Studies that reported estimates from
visual analogue scales, the Quality and Well-Being Scale, and the
Rosser Index were excluded. Kidney Disease Quality of Life
(KDQOL) scores were also excluded unless all eight SF-36
domains were reported separately and a utility could be calculated,
as above.
Search Methods
Using a specific renal search strategy based on one developed by
the Cochrane Renal Group, and with input from the Cochrane
Renal Group information management specialist, we searched 11
databases for articles published from database inception to 1
December 2010 (Text S2). MeSH terms and text words used are
provided in Text S3. We undertook extensive searching of
reference lists and conference proceedings and contacted relevant
authors. This led to other unpublished grey literature such as PhD
dissertations. Where there were multiple publications from the
same study population, the most recent article that reported
sufficient data for analysis was used unless there was a significant
variation in sample size, in which case the study with the largest
study population was used.
Data Extraction and Management
Data from included studies were extracted onto a standardised
data sheet by M. W. and R. L. M., with differences resolved
through discussion. (Table S1). For non-English articles, native
speakers were found to translate the articles where possible;
otherwise, web-based translation tools were used. The reviewers
were not blinded to study authors, affiliations, or journal name
[12]. Variables recorded from each article included the following:
publication year, number of patients, country, demographic and
clinical characteristics of patients, type and time of treatment, and
the utility estimates. We recorded the proportion of the study
population with diabetes using prevalence rates or, if these were
not reported, the rates for diabetic nephropathy from each sample.

In intervention studies, such as randomised controlled trials for
new drugs, baseline characteristics were used to avoid the
influence of the intervention on utility estimates. In studies where
treatment groups were split by a clinical or demographic factor,
the total group was used where possible. In longitudinal kidney
transplant studies, utility at 12 mo was used, as this was considered
a stable health state. In longitudinal studies of conservatively
managed patients, baseline utility was used. Longitudinal analysis
of utility-based quality of life was planned for all treatment groups
(pre-treatment CKD, dialysis, conservative care, and transplanta￾tion).
Data Analysis
Variance. When the standard deviation of a utility estimate
was not reported, it was calculated, where possible, from the
standard error. Because the standard deviation could not be
calculated in many studies, we fitted a regression model using
fractional polynomials of the observed standard deviations against
utility estimates for those studies that provided a standard
deviation [13].
Meta-regression. For the meta-regression, we fitted random
effects models with robust estimation of standard errors to allow
for potential clustering where studies provided more than one
utility value [14]. This allowed us to use multiple utilities from a
single study population. Because of missing data, we fitted separate
models for each of the subgroups of interest (e.g., mean age group,
year of publication), but adjusting for treatment modality (e.g.,
dialysis) and utility instrument in each model, where appropriate.
We performed Wald tests to determine the significance of
subgroups in the analyses.
Results
Study Characteristics
The flow chart for identifying studies is shown in Figure 1. We
included 190 studies representing over 56,000 patients (Text S4;
Figure S1). The primary reason for exclusion was incomplete
reporting of SF-36 domain scores (n = 127), which prohibited
calculation of utility. Of the 190 studies, 22 (12%) were published
in languages other than English. Ninety-two (48%) of the included
studies reported more than one utility, generating a total of 326
utility estimates from the 190 studies.
Of the 326 utility estimates, 25 were from pre-treatment CKD
patients, 226 were from dialysis patients, 66 were from kidney
transplant patients, and three were from conservative care patients
(Table 1). Six utilities were from patient populations receiving
mixed treatments or where the treatment was unclear. The
majority of utilities from dialysis patients were from patients
treated with haemodialysis. The proportion of patients with
diabetes was provided for 224 utilities (Table 1). The majority of
utilities (n = 250, 77%) were derived through the SF-36 question￾naire (Table 1).
Cross-sectional studies accounted for 216 (66%) utilities, cohort
studies accounted for 57 (17%), case-control studies accounted for
34 (10%), and randomised controlled trials accounted for 16 (5%).
Three estimates came from studies that were not one of those four
study types. The majority of utility estimates had been published
since the year 2000.
Imputation of Standard Deviations
The standard deviation was available for 46 (14.1%) utility
estimates. The utility estimates for which the standard deviation
was available ranged from 0.39 to 0.94, and the utility estimates
for which the standard deviation was missing ranged from 0.38 to
0.89. The equation for predicting the standard deviation of a
utility estimate was standard deviation = 0.36820.826UtilityScor￾e

Utility Estimates by Kidney Disease Treatment Modality
The reference group in the model was kidney transplant
patients with utility elicited via the time tradeoff instrument. The
mean utility for this group was the highest, at 0.82 (95% CI: 0.74,
0.90), followed by the pre-treatment CKD group, 0.79 (95% CI:
0.70, 0.89), dialysis patients, 0.70 (95% CI: 0.62, 0.78), and
conservative care patients, 0.62 (95% CI: 0.43, 0.82) (interaction
p,0.001; Table 2).
There were 207 utility estimates specific to dialysis modality,
either haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. While haemodialysis
had a clinically lower mean utility estimate than peritoneal dialysis,
0.69 (95% CI: 0.59, 0.80) versus 0.72 (95% CI: 0.62, 0.83), the
difference was not statistically significant (interaction p = 0.08;
Table 2).
Within peritoneal dialysis treatment, still using the referent time
tradeoff instrument, a significantly higher mean utility was found
for patients treated with automated peritoneal dialysis (0.80; 95%
CI: 0.69, 0.91) compared to those treated with continuous
ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (0.72; 95% CI: 0.60, 0.85)
(interaction p= 0.02; Table 2).
Subgroup Analyses
Demographics. After adjusting for treatment type and utility
instrument, mean patient age, which was available for 282
estimates, did not significantly influence utility (interaction
p= 0.22). We were limited in our ability to further investigate
the effect of age because of incomplete reporting and the use of
mean age rather than patient-level data. Patient sex and
geographic region also did not influence utility (interaction
p= 0.37 and p= 0.07, respectively).
The percentage of patients with diabetes was reported for 224
utility estimates. There was a statistically significant difference in
utility between patient groups with high, medium, or low rates of
diabetes after adjusting for treatment type and utility instrument
(interaction p,0.001). The group composed wholly of patients
with diabetes had utilities 0.10 lower than those in the group
without any diabetic patients, 0.81 (95% CI: 0.70, 0.91) versus
0.91 (95% CI: 0.82, 1.00) (Table 2).
Utility elicitation instrument and year of
publication. Utility elicitation instrument was a statistically
significant predictor of utility values (p = 0.01), with utilities
converted from SF-36 and SF-12 questionnaires being significantly
lower. EQ-5D estimates derived from the SF-36 were also
generally lower than EQ-5D values acquired directly in studies
where these two instruments were administered to the same
patients (Table 3). There were no studies that administered both
the SF-12 and EQ-5D instruments to the same patients. The year
of publication was statistically significant for transplant utilities
(interaction p,0.001): the mean utility estimate for kidney
transplant was 0.66 between 1980 and 1989, 0.81 between 1990
and 1999, and 0.85 between 2000 and 2010, after controlling for
elicitation instrument (Table 2).
Longitudinal studies. Nine studies provided longitudinal
data on mean utilities in the kidney transplant population (Table 4).
Two studies reported longitudinal data for two different groups,
resulting in longitudinal data for 11 patient groups. Of these 11
patient groups, only seven reported post-transplant utility over
time. Two of these groups showed an increase in utility, and the
remaining five groups showed no significant change. There were
insufficient numbers of longitudinal studies in pre-treatment CKD,

dialysis, and conservative management treatment groups to
perform longitudinal analyses for these treatment groups.
Discussion
This meta-analysis has confirmed that mean utility is higher for
kidney transplant patients than for dialysis patients [7,8]. We have
also found that utility is higher for transplant patients than for pre￾treatment CKD patients. We have shown that patients on
automated peritoneal dialysis have higher utility than patients on
continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis, that diabetes has an
adverse influence on utility for pre-treatment CKD patients, and
that conservative care patients report the lowest utility of any
treatment group. This work extends prior reviews in three ways:
first, by analysing the effect of the era of publication on utility;
second, by including a broader spectrum of patients, specifically
those with pre-treatment CKD as well as conservative care
patients; and, finally, by including all utility elicitation instruments,
enabling comparisons across instruments to be made.
The finding that transplant patients’ utilities increased signifi￾cantly over time likely reflects improvements in transplant care
and evolving clinical practice (e.g., the increasing number of
immunosuppression drug options such as tacrolimus, mycophe￾nolate mofetil, sirolimus, and steroid-free immunosuppression),
and possibly a selection bias of younger patients with less co￾morbidity accessing transplantation. It is possible that given the
increased acceptance of higher risk patients into transplant
programs over time, the utility effect of transplantation may be
underestimated. The majority of longitudinal utility estimates for
kidney transplant recipients did not show a clinically significant
change. The small number of studies, with relatively short follow￾up (2 y or less), suggests that this is an area that would benefit from
additional research.
The type of utility elicitation instrument used was a statistically
significant predictor of reported utility; some caution is therefore
required when comparing values across instruments. The 15D,
standard gamble, and time tradeoff instruments yielded utility
estimates that were significantly higher than those from the EQ￾5D (both directly measured as well as converted from the SF-36
and SF-12) and the SF-6D. We cannot recommend one particular
instrument to be used in preference to others, as all instruments
have their benefits and challenges in different settings. Instead, we
offer criteria that may be considered in the choice of instrument.
First, ensure that the instrument will measure the changes the

study expects to see in the CKD population. For example, the EQ￾5D may not be sensitive enough to detect changes in quality of life
related to visual impairment (e.g., diabetic retinopathy) because it
does not include a vision-specific domain. Second, review the

tralia, or the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence
in the UK, the latter of which prefers the EQ-5D. Third, if utility￾based quality of life is sought, a utility-based quality of life measure
(e.g., time tradeoff or Health Utilities Index), rather than a generic
questionnaire that is not utility based (e.g., SF-36 or SF-12), may
be preferable. Recognise that if SF-36 or SF-12 is used, the derived
utility will probably be lower than if utility has been measured
directly. Finally, consider the frequency of the measurement. If
repeated measurements are required, a simple instrument that can
be completed quickly and reduces the likelihood of missing data
may be preferable. There are other logistical issues that may also
play a role in the decision to use one particular instrument (e.g.,
the availability of the preferred instrument in the local language).
The use of these criteria should optimise the instrument choice for
any particular purpose, setting, and clinical population.
There are a number of limitations to this study. First, treatment
assignments were not random, limiting the strength of the
conclusions that can be drawn from the findings. Second, we
could not adequately account for demographic differences such as
age and sex, nor for clinical differences such as delivered dialysis
dose or kidney transplant function, because of the incompleteness
of reported data and our reliance on the aggregated, rather than
patient-level, data provided by studies. The form of the aggregated
data we assembled meant it was not possible to perform an
additional meta-regression to assess whether differences in the study
characteristics accounted for heterogeneity. Third, we calculated
EQ-5D scores from SF-36 and SF-12 data, and the algorithms may
not reflect what the EQ-5D scores would have been had they been
measured directly. This is of particular note given the large number
of studies that used SF-36 data. Additionally, because these EQ-5D
scores were calculated, we had to impute standard deviations, and
this may have affected the results. Fourth, there was an insufficient
number of studies of home haemodialysis to conduct a separate
analysis for this sub-modality. Fifth, there were just three studies that
explored the utility of conservative care patients, limiting the
conclusions that can be drawn about the quality of life of patients
who choose to forgo dialysis. Sixth, longitudinal data were available
only for the transplant population. Finally, our search was
conducted in December 2010, and additional relevant studies
may have been published since then.

Utility-Based Quality of Life in CKD
PLOS Medicine | www.plosmedicine.org 7 September 2012 | Volume 9 | Issue 9 | e1001307

The strengths of this review are its size and comprehensiveness.
By including 326 utilities from over 56,000 participants, this
analysis is substantially larger than previous reviews [7,8]. The size
of this review enabled subgroup analyses that revealed previously
unknown findings. Additionally, this review was comprehensive as
it included non-English-language articles and unpublished theses
as well as a broader patient population, including pre-treatment
CKD and conservative care patients, groups that have not to our
knowledge been included in previous analyses.
Implications for Clinical Practice
Our results suggest that automated peritoneal dialysis, a home￾based form of dialysis that accounts for just 7% of dialysis patients
in the UK and 4% of dialysis patients in the United States [1,3],
has a significantly higher mean utility than continuous ambulatory
peritoneal dialysis. We interpret this finding with caution, as these
utility estimates were not drawn from randomised comparisons,
and patient groups treated with different modalities are likely to be
different (e.g., differences in burden of co-morbidities or degree of
family support). However, our findings do suggest that an
expansion of automated peritoneal dialysis in clinical practice
may be appropriate where possible. The pooled utility estimates
for the two types of dialysis may inform discussions with patients
about the benefits and harms of different dialysis sub-modalities,
particularly in cases where there is uncertainty or equipoise in
terms of modality-specific survival.
Areas for further research include longitudinal assessment of
kidney transplant and dialysis patients’ utility-based quality of life,
the accuracy of the algorithm that translates SF-36 scores into EQ￾5D scores, and the quality of life experienced by patients who
choose conservative care. Further research assessing quality of life
with home-based dialysis modalities (i.e., home haemodialysis and
peritoneal dialysis) would help determine to what extent the higher
utilities seen for automated peritoneal dialysis reflect the location
of treatment, rather than the type of treatment.
Conclusions
This research is to our knowledge the largest meta-analysis on
this topic to date, and includes eight different utility instruments,
with published as well as unpublished studies from English- and
non-English-language journals. Within the dialysis population, the
highest utility of the sub-modalities was reported by those on
home-based automated peritoneal dialysis. This finding suggests
that the management of patients on automated peritoneal dialysis
is beneficial in CKD care. This study has also shown that utility￾based quality of life for transplant recipients has been improving
over time, with clear increases in mean utility since the 1980s. We
found that patients who chose conservative care had significantly
lower quality of life than patients treated with dialysis, an area that
requires further research. These findings can be used in economic
evaluations of kidney therapies, and may also be useful in
treatment discussions with patients.

Editors’ Summary
Background. Ill health can adversely affect an individual’s
quality of life, particularly if caused by long-term (chronic)
conditions, such as chronic kidney disease—in the United
States alone, 23 million people have chronic kidney disease,
of whom 570,000 are treated with dialysis or kidney
transplantation. In order to measure the cost-effectiveness
of interventions to manage medical conditions, health
economists use an objective measurement known as
quality-adjusted life years. However, although useful, qual￾ity-adjusted life years are often criticized for not taking into
account the views and preferences of the individuals with
the medical conditions. A measurement called a utility solves
this problem. Utilities are a numerical value (measured on a 0
to 1 scale, where 0 represents death and 1 represents full
health) of the strength of an individual’s preference for
specified health-related outcomes, as measured by ‘‘instru￾ments’’ (questionnaires) that rate direct comparisons or
assess quality of life.
Why Was This Study Done? Previous studies have
suggested that, in people with chronic kidney disease,
quality of life (as measured by utility) is higher in those with a
functioning kidney transplant than in those on dialysis.
However, currently, it is unclear whether the type of dialysis
affects quality of life: hemodialysis is a highly technical
process that directly filters the blood, usually must be done
2–4 times a week, and can only be performed in a health
facility; peritoneal dialysis, in which fluids are infused into the
abdominal cavity, can be done nightly at home (automated
peritoneal dialysis) or throughout the day (continuous
ambulatory peritoneal dialysis). In this study, the researchers
reviewed and assimilated all of the available evidence to
investigate whether quality of life in people with chronic
kidney disease (as measured by utility) differed according to
treatment type.
What Did the Researchers Do and Find? The researchers
did a comprehensive search of 11 databases to identify all
relevant studies that included people with severe (stage 3, 4,
or 5) chronic kidney disease, their form of treatment, and
information on utilities—either reported directly, or included
in quality of life instruments (SF-36), so the researchers could
calculate utilities by using a validated algorithm. The
researchers also recorded the prevalence rates of diabetes
in study participants. Then, using statistical models that
adjusted for various factors, including treatment type and
the method of measuring utilities, the researchers were able
to calculate the pooled utilities of each form of treatment for
chronic kidney disease.
The researchers included 190 studies, representing over
56,000 patients and generating 326 utility estimates, in their
analysis. The majority of utilities (77%) were derived through
the SF-36 questionnaire via calculation. Of the 326 utility
estimates, 25 were from patients pre-dialysis, 226 were from
dialysis patients (the majority of whom were receiving
hemodialysis), 66 were from kidney transplant patients, and
three were from conservative care patients. The researchers
found that the highest average utility was for those who had
renal transplantation, 0.82, followed by the pre-dialysis
group (0.80), dialysis patients (0.71), and, finally, patients
receiving conservative care (0.62). When comparing the type
of dialysis, the researchers found that there was little
difference in utility between hemodialysis and peritoneal
dialysis, but patients using automated peritoneal dialysis
had, on average, a higher utility (0.80) than those treated
with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (0.72). Finally,
the researchers found that patient groups with diabetes had
significantly lower utilities than those without diabetes.
What Do These Findings Mean? These findings suggest
that in people with chronic kidney disease, renal transplan￾tation is the best treatment option to improve quality of life.
For those on dialysis, home-based automated peritoneal
dialysis may improve quality of life more than the other
forms of dialysis: this finding is important, as this type of
dialysis is not as widely used as other forms and is also
cheaper than hemodialysis. Furthermore, these findings
suggest that patients who choose conservative care have
significantly lower quality of life than patients treated with
dialysis, a finding that warrants further investigation. Overall,
in addition to helping to inform economic evaluations of
treatment options, the information from this analysis can
help guide clinicians caring for patients with chronic kidney
disease in their discussions about possible treatment
options.
