Objective: Our aim was to estimate prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MS), obesity and comorbidities in a cohort of 120
children (3–18 years) with biopsy-proven non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and
to evaluate correlations between clinical or biochemical variables and liver histology.
Research methods and procedures: MS was diagnosed according to the adapted National Cholesterol Education Program
criteria. Homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), quantitative insulin-sensitivity check index (QUICKI);
and ISI composite, insulin secretion (insulin response at 30 min after a glucose load; HOMA-b cell; insulinogenic index) were all
estimated. BMI z-score and total body fat (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) were evaluated as indexes of obesity.
Results: MS was diagnosed in 66% of children. About 92% had weight above the 85th percentile, of which 42% were obese
with weight above 97th percentile. Prevalence of hypertriglyceridaemia was 63%, low HDL cholesterol 45%, hypertension 40%
and impaired glucose tolerance 10%. Levels of aminotransferases were higher as the number of comorbidities increased, the
highest values being found in subjects with MS (Pp0.05). Prevalence of a grade of steatosis X2 (P ¼ 0.05) and fibrosis (Pp0.01)
was higher in subjects with MS. Histology was associated significantly with higher values of a number of clinical and biochemical
parameters (steatosis X2 with BMI z-score (P ¼ 0.04), fasting insulin (P ¼ 0.02), HOMA-IR (P ¼ 0.03), b-cell secretion (P ¼ 0.04);
necroinflammation with BMI z-score (P ¼ 0.007), glucose (Pp0.0001), cholesterol (Pp0.04) and white blood cells (P ¼ 0.025);
fibrosis with body weight (P ¼ 0.05), BMI z-score (P ¼ 0.03), cholesterol (P ¼ 0.05), triglycerides (P ¼ 0.05), fasting insulin
(Pp0.0001) and mean values of the hormone at the OGTT (P ¼ 0.03), HOMA-IR (Pp0.0001)).
Conclusion: Presence of MS or clinical and biochemical variables associated with the syndrome seems to be strictly related to
histological features of NASH in paediatric fatty liver disease. Thus, routinely liver biopsy should be encouraged in these children.

Introduction
In westernised countries, prevalence of paediatric obesity
and comorbidities, which all cluster together in the meta￾bolic syndrome (MS),1 are going to reach epidemic propor￾tions in the next decades. Comorbidities include impairment
of glucose and insulin metabolism, (exhaustion of b-cell
function, reduced systemic and peripheral insulin sensitivity),
dyslipidaemia and hypertension. In the past decade, non￾alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become a common
report in obese or overweight subjects.2 The disease may be
regarded as feature of MS.3 NAFLD may present as a spectrum
of disease: from asymptomatic steatosis with elevated or
normal aminotransferases to steatohepatitis (non-alcoholic
steatohepatitis (NASH)), cirrhosis with complications of liver
function to hepatocellular carcinoma.2 NASH may be
suspected if there is two- to threefold increased in amino￾transferases levels and ultrasound liver brightness. However,
definite diagnosis requires liver biopsy.2
A number of studies have shown how components of MS
may contribute to alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity,4–6
severe liver steatosis,7,8 NASH activity,8,9 fibrosis8 or isolated
portal fibrosis10 in adults with NAFLD/NASH.
In childhood, NAFLD may develop very early in pre-school
age. In Italy, diagnosis of NAFLD may be suspected in one￾fourth of obese children.11 Conversely, obesity occurs in 40% of
children with biopsy-proven NAFLD/NASH,12,13 overweight in
50%, insulin resistance (IR) in 62%, and 2% patients have type 2
diabetes mellitus (T2DM).13 Obesity and IR seem to be strongly
associated with increased risk of fibrosis and steatohepatitis.13 Received 23 January 2007; revised 7 July 2007; accepted 9 July 2007;

In the present study, we aim to estimate prevalence of
MS, obesity, clinical and biochemical features of metabolic
impairment in the largest cohort of biopsy-proven NAFLD
children hitherto described in the literature, and to investi￾gate any relation of metabolic variables to liver histology.
Materials and methods
Patients
One hundred and twenty consecutive biopsy-proven NAFLD
children (3–18 years) were enrolled from January 2003 to
September 2006. Inclusion criteria were persistently elevated
serum aminotransferases and/or fluctuating between normal
and elevated levels, with two elevated measurements during
the past 6 months before enrolment; diffusely echogenic
liver imaging suggestive of fatty liver infiltration, exclusion
of hepatic virus infections, no alcohol consumption, no
history of parenteral nutrition, and no use of drugs able to
induce steatosis. Known liver diseases were ruled out by
appropriate test as described previously.12
The study protocol was conformed to the Declaration of
Helsinki and to the recommendations of the Ethics Com￾mittee at the Children’s Hospital ‘Bambino Gesu`’. The nature
and purpose of the study were carefully explained before
informed consent was requested from each responsible
guardian.
Definition of obesity, metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance
and secretion
Body mass index (BMI) (wt (kg)/ht2 (m)) and Roher index
(RI: wt (kg)/ht3 (m)) were computed.14 To compare BMI
across different ages and between genders, BMI z-score was
determined.15
Identification of MS among children was based on the
adult criteria defined by the National Cholesterol Education
Program (NCEP).1 In the adult definition, a minimum of
three of the five major criteria (obesity determined by waist
circumference, hypertension, low high-density lipoprotein
(HDL) cholesterol levels, elevated triglycerides and glucose
intolerance) should be fulfilled. These criteria have been
modified for children.16 Obesity was defined as a BMIX97th
percentile adjusted for age and sex; overweight as a BMI
within the 85th and the 96th percentiles; hypertriglycer￾idaemia as triglycerides 495th percentile for age, gender and
race;17 low HDL cholesterol as concentrations o5th percen￾tile for age and sex;17 elevated blood pressure as systolic or
diastolic BP495th percentile for age and sex.18 Glucose
intolerance was defined according to the criteria of the
American Diabetes Association.19 Therefore, we defined MS
in presence of X3 of the following 4 criteria: obesity,
hypertension, dyslipidaemia (low HDL or elevated triglycer￾ides) and glucose intolerance.16
Insulin resistance was determined by the homeostatic
model assessment (HOMA-IR ¼ (insulin  glucose)/22.5);20
insulin sensitivity by the quantitative insulin-sensitivity
check index (QUICKI ¼ 1/(log plasma fasting insulin
(mIU l1
) þ log plasma fasting glucose (mg dl1
)))21 and the
insulin sensitivity index (ISI composite ¼ (10 000/square root
of (fasting glucose  fasting insulin)  (mean glucose  mean
insulin during oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT))).22
Insulin secretion was calculated as the corrected insulin
response from 30 min insulin and glucose levels: (insulin
30/(glucose 30  (glucose 30–3.9))) (mIU  mmol2
);23 the
insulinogenic index (IGI) (insulin 30–insulin 0)/(glucose
30–glucose 0);24 the Homa-b cell % ((fasting in￾sulin  3.33)/(fasting glucose3.5)).20
Estimation of body composition
Total body fat (TBF) was estimated from total body dual￾energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans made with a QDR￾1500 total body scanner (Hologic Inc., Waltmann, MA, USA)
in the pencil-beam mode with the enhanced whole body
analysis (software version 5.67).
Biochemical assays
Serum was stored at 801C for later assays. Plasma glucose
was measured in triplicate by the glucose oxidase technique
on a Beckman glucose analyzer (Beckman, Fullerton, CA,
USA) and plasma insulin by a specific radioimmunoassay
(MYRIA Technogenetics, Milan, Italy). Serum triglycerides
(intra-assay coefficient of variation (CV) 1.5% and inter￾assay CV 1.8%), total (intra-assay CV 0.8%; inter-assay CV
1.7%) and HDL cholesterol (intra-assay CV 0.95%, inter￾assay CV 1.3%) were measured by routine colorimetric assays
(Roche/Hitachi Modular P/D, Can 433, Milan, Italy).
Liver histology
Biopsies were performed and processed as described else￾where.12 The main histological features described in NAFLD/
NASH including steatosis, inflammation (portal and lobular),
hepatocyte ballooning and fibrosis were scored by using the
Scoring System for NAFLD.25 Steatosis was graded on a four￾point scale: grade 0 ¼ steatosis involving o5% hepatocytes;
grade 1 ¼ steatosis involving up to 33%; grade 2 ¼ steatosis
involving 33–66%; and grade 3 ¼ steatosis involving 466%.
Lobular inflammation was graded on a four-point scale:
grade 0 ¼ no foci; grade 1 ¼ less than 2 foci per 200  field;
grade 2 ¼ 2–4 foci per 200  filed; grade 3 ¼ more than 4 foci
per 200  field. Hepatocyte ballooning was graded from 0 to
2: 0 ¼ none, 1 ¼ few balloon cells and 2 ¼ many/prominent
balloon cells. Stage of fibrosis was quantified on a four-point
scale: stage 0 ¼ no fibrosis; stage1 ¼ perisinusoidal or peri￾portal; stage 2 ¼ perisinusoidal and portal/periportal; stage
3 ¼ bridging; and stage 4 ¼ cirrhosis. Portal tract inflamma￾tion was graded from 0 to 3 (0 is none, 1 ¼ mild,
2 ¼ moderate and 3 ¼ severe). Features of steatosis (0–3),
lobular inflammation (0–3) and hepatocyte ballooning (0–2)

were combined in a score from 0 to 8, named NAFLD activity
score (NAS). Cases with NASX5 are diagnostic of NASH, cases
with NASp2 are diagnostic of simple steatosis, whereas cases
in between are considered indeterminate.25 Iron storage was
scored from 0 to 4 according to Searle.26
Statistical analysis
Data are presented as mean7s.d. The Kolmogorov–Smirnov
goodness-of-fit test was used for determining whether
sample data are likely to derive from a normal-distributed
population. RI, triglycerides, ALT, gGT, white blood cells,
fasting insulin, mean values of insulin during the OGTT,
HOMA-IR, insulin secretion and histological grades diverged
significantly from normal distribution and were logarithmi￾cally transformed before analysis. The non-parametric
Spearman correlation coefficient was used to assess signifi￾cant correlations among variables. One-way analysis of
variance followed by analysis of covariance using general
linear models (to correct for effect modifiers, such as sex, age
and BMI z-score) were used to determine differences in
insulin resistance and secretion. Univariate analysis, Kruskal–
Wallis test and Bonferroni’s post hoc test for multiple com￾parisons were carried out by standard techniques whenever
appropriate. Level of significance was set at a ¼ 0.05. SPSS
11.5 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used.
Results
Table 1 shows anthropometric characteristics and biochem￾ical data of the population according to gender. As expected,
male sex was prevalent (Pp0.0001). ALT levels were
moderately increased (77.6775.45 and 83.57716.04 IU l1
,
respectively). Children were mostly insulin-resistant, with
only eight patients (6%) having a value of HOMA-IRp1.
Mean values of HOMA-IR were 2.5870.16 in male and
4.0770.7 in female patients. They had an increased b-cell
function (299.82730.15 vs 342.69741.32%), as stated by a
HOMA-b-cell value X100% in 114 patients (95%).
Table 2 reports prevalence of MS and associated variables.
Prevalence of obesity accounted for 42%, while overweight
for 50%. Dyslipidaemia was largely diagnosed with low HDL
cholesterol found in 45% of the population (mean values
were 4276.39 and 52.1777.48 mg dl1 in the two sexes in
Table 1) and hypertriglyceridaemia in 63% (112.2878.14
and 94.65711.48 mg dl1 respectively in Table 1; Pp0.05
between sexes). Hypertension accounted for 40%, while
prevalence of overt diabetes was 2%.
According to the family history, obesity was diagnosed in
7% of both first- and second-degree relatives; type 2 diabetes
mellitus in no relative of first degree and in 17% of second
degree; dyslipidaemia in 47 and 41%, respectively; hyper￾tension in 38% first degree and 40% second degree.
Table 3 displays mean values of metabolic variables in
subjects with no sign of MS, 1–2 factors associated with the
syndrome and subjects with MS. Levels of ALT and aspartate
aminotransferase (AST) increased as the number of comor￾bidities increased up to full MS (Pp0.05 for all comparison).
Subjects with no sign, 1–2 factors associated with MS, and
those with overt MS showed statistically different values of
fasting and after OGTT insulin, HOMA-IR and ISI composite
(Table 3, analysis of variance), but no differences in NAS
score. Fibrosis was present in 8% subjects with no MS; in 46%
with 1–2 comorbidities and in 45% MS subjects (Pp0.01

among subjects with no risk factor and the other two
groups). A grade of steatosis X2 was present in 11, 51 and
38% subjects (P ¼ 0.05 among subjects with no risk factor
and the other two groups). Necroinflammation was present
in 11, 64 and 25%, respectively (P ¼ NS).
Concerning histology concerns, steatosis was present in
all subjects. It was mostly macrovescicular. Inflammation
was present in 69% biopsies. Hepatocyte ballooning was
found in 53% cases. PAS-D-positive cells containing phago￾cytosed cells debris were present in the portal tract and/or in
the sinusoids. No Mallory’s hyaline was noted in any case,
and mild iron deposition was present in three cases.
Diagnosis of NASH was formulated in 38 patients (NASX5),
a diagnosis of simple steatosis (NASp2) was made in 41
patients; whereas 41 were considered indeterminate. When
the criteria of Schwimmer et al.
27 were applied, only 3%
patients met the criteria for NASH type 2 diagnosis, and 30%
children encountered the criteria for NASH type 2. Most
patients showed an overlapping of NASH types 1 and 2
(54%). Increased fibrosis was observed in 67% patients.
Bioptic signs of cirrhosis were not detected in any patient.
Noteworthy, 23% patients had normal values of ALT at the
time of biopsy. They showed significantly lower fat mass
(15.1177.23 vs 18.8174.64 kg; P ¼ 0.03) and triglycerides
(83.89724.57 vs 113.54780.18; P ¼ 0.05) as compared with
subjects with increased aminotransferases. When the popu￾lation was stratified according to levels of ALT, either
normal or increased, prevalence of steatosis was 86 vs
100% (Pp0.001), fibrosis 64 vs 67% (Pp0.001), necroin￾flammation 61 vs 74% (Pp0.001) and NAS score X55 vs 18%
(P ¼ 0.04).
Analysis of variance failed to find any significant differ￾ence among subjects when divided according to the NAS
score (Table 4).
Univariate analysis
A grade of steatosis X2 was associated with higher BMI

Among histological features, namely steatosis, necro￾inflammation, either lobular or portal inflammation, balloon￾ing and fibrosis, grade of fibrosis was the only one associated
with MS (P ¼ 0.05).
Discussion
Diagnosis of MS is very common in children affected by fatty
liver disease, being observed in more than 50% of them.
Patients with MS show levels of aminotransferases signifi￾cantly higher than children without MS. Fibrosis and severe
steatosis are frequently reported. Among comorbidities,
obesity, dyslipidaemia and hypertension are largely
described in fatty liver disease, while insulin resistance and
excessive body weight (either obesity or overweight) are
almost universal findings. Nevertheless, 7% patients are
normal weight children, even though insulin-resistant.
Thus, therapeutic attempts based on the prescription of
healthy diet and regular physical exercise should be
encouraged in normal-weight patients too12 with the
purpose to reduce insulin resistance and hence fatty liver
infiltration and inflammation.
So far, large population-based studies have tried to
establish the prevalence of the MS in the paediatric age by
adapting the Adult Treatment Panel III criteria of the
National Education Program.16,27 The syndrome occurs in
4.2% of healthy adolescents.28 Its prevalence increases to
6.1 and 28.7% in overweight and obese adolescents,
respectively,27 and, according to this report, it achieves the
rate of 66% in children with fatty liver disease.
Our study represents the first survey looking at the
prevalence of MS in one of the largest biopsy-proven series
of NAFLD children. It may represent the extension of a
previous study performed in 84 children with a different
aim. In that study, we described lower rates of hypertension
and dyslipidaemia, both defined by using fixed cutoffs,

which were independent of age and gender.12 Furthermore,
we did not evaluate b-cell function.
In cohorts of biopsy-proven NAFLD/NASH children from
United States, Schwimmer et Lavine13,29 found obesity in
92% and overweight in 6% of patients. Type 2 diabetes
mellitus was more frequently diagnosed as compared with
our series, being described in 8% of population. On the
contrary, prevalence of insulin resistance, defined either as
HOMA-IRX2 or QUICKIp0.339, overlapped in both series.
The authors did not provide data on insulin secretion and
MS.
Apart from differences in prevalence of comorbidities, it is
also worth highlighting significant differences in histology
with respect to the Schwimmer’s series.13,29 These observa￾tions have been described elsewhere and discussed in
detail.12 Briefly, in the Rome cohort, type 1 NASH seems
less frequent than in the SanDiego series; therefore, our
patients having mostly type 2 NASH or a kind of portal
injury that were classified them as overlapping types 1 and 2.12
A reasonable explanation for these divergences may be the
large number (77%) of Hispanic and Asian patients in the
SanDiego series compared with only Caucasians in our
cohort.
As far as b-cell function is concerned, fasting insulin
secretion (HOMA-b cell) is significantly increased in patients
affected by severe steatosis and it trends to be in those with
fibrosis (Figure 2a). Conversely, patients with liver fibrosis
have significantly decreased insulinogenic index (Figure 2b),
which means likely an impairment of the first-phase insulin
secretion.28 They also show the left shift of the hyperbola
(Figure 1), representing the relation between insulin action
and secretion, the so-called ‘disposition index’.30 Accord￾ingly, these children may be those who are probably at risk of
developing the impairment of the glucose tolerance.
Histological findings correlate significantly with clinical
and biochemical factors. A grade of steatosis X2 is associated
with higher BMI z-score, indexes of insulin resistance and
b-cell function. Necroinflammation correlates with BMI
z-score, RI, fasting glucose and total cholesterol, levels of
aminotransferases and white blood cell count. Fibrosis is
associated with higher body weight and BMI z-score,
cholesterol and triglyceride levels, insulin resistance, fasting
insulin and average values of the hormone during the OGTT.
Noteworthy among histological features is that fibrosis is
significantly associated with the MS.
Finally, it is remarkable that 23% of patients had normal
values of ALT at the time of biopsy even though fibrosis was
observed in 60% of them. This observation confirms that
aminotransferases do not necessary reflect the grade in liver
derangement2 and suggests that NAFLD/NASH may be
underdiagnosed and undertreated in children since in
most studies and in clinical practice, ALT levels and liver
brightness remain the main clinical criteria to diagnose the
disease.
In conclusion, prevalence of either MS or clinical/
biochemical variables associated with its diagnosis is remark￾able in children with biopsy-proven NAFLD/NASH. Presence
of one or more comorbidities augments significantly the risk
of fibrosis, which is consistent in case of full MS. For this
reason, metabolic risk factors should be carefully evaluated
and aggressively treated in these patients. Vice versa, in the
presence of MS or its components, NAFLD/NASH should be
investigated by repeated measurement of liver enzymes and
liver ultrasounds. Further studies are warranted to evaluate
the role and timing of liver biopsy.
