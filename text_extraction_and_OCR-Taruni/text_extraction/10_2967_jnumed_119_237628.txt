Accurate definition of the extent and severity of left-ventricular assist
device (LVAD) infection may facilitate therapeutic decision making
and targeted surgical intervention. Here, we explore the value of
18F-FDG PET/CT for guidance of patient management. Methods:
Fifty-seven LVAD-carrying patients received 85 whole-body 18F￾FDG PET/CT scans for the work-up of device infection. Clinical
follow-up was obtained for up to 2 y. Results: PET/CT showed
various patterns of infectious involvement of the 4 LVAD compo￾nents: driveline entry point (77% of patients), subcutaneous drive￾line path (87%), pump pocket (49%), and outflow tract (58%).
Driveline smears revealed Staphylococcus or Pseudomonas strains
as the underlying pathogen in most cases (48 and 34%, respec￾tively). At receiver-operating-characteristic analysis, an 18F-FDG
SUV of more than 2.5 was most accurate to identify smear-positive
driveline infection. Infection of 3 or all 4 LVAD components showed
a trend toward lower survival than did infection of 2 or fewer com￾ponents (P 5 0.089), whereas involvement of thoracic lymph nodes
was significantly associated with an adverse outcome (P 5 0.001
for nodal SUV above vs. below median). Finally, patients who un￾derwent early surgical revision within 3 mo after PET/CT (n 5 21)
required significantly less inpatient hospital care during follow-up
than did those receiving delayed surgical revision (n 5 11; P ,
0.05). Conclusion: Whole-body 18F-FDG PET/CT identifies the ex￾tent of LVAD infection and predicts adverse outcome. Initial expe￾rience suggests that early image-guided surgical intervention may
facilitate a less complicated subsequent course.

Left-ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation improves
survival and quality of life in end-stage heart failure and is increas￾ingly used for destination therapy as an alternative to heart trans￾plantation (1–4). Despite continuous technologic improvement,
device infection remains a major complication after LVAD implan￾tation (5,6), because the driveline provides a transcutaneous pathway
for entry, growth, and spread of pathogens toward internal compo￾nents of the system and beyond. Although the driveline entry point
at skin level is readily accessible, the diagnostic and therapeutic
management of internally spreading LVAD infection is challenging.
PET/CT with the glucose analog 18F-FDG, which is avidly
taken up by inflammatory leukocytes and infectious pathogens,
is an emerging technique for imaging of cardiovascular implant
infection (7). The benefit of PET/CT over conventional leukocyte
scintigraphy is its higher sensitivity and faster imaging protocol,
whereas morphologically driven techniques such as echocardiogra￾phy and CT are limited by artifacts from the implant material and
MRI is not an option. The feasibility and diagnostic accuracy of PET/
CT for detecting LVAD infection has been reported in small patient
groups by several centers and was recently summarized in a meta￾analysis (8). This is a first step toward broader clinical implementa￾tion, which should be amended by demonstration of a link between
PET/CT results and adverse outcome and by data showing that out￾come can be improved when imaging is used to guide therapy (9).
Here, we report the use of 18F-FDG PET/CT for clinical guidance
in patients with advanced LVAD infection in our large LVAD referral
center (1,4,10). We speculated that 18F-FDG PET/CT not only would
identify subjects at elevated risk but also would guide surgical therapy
to improve the subsequent course. To test our hypothesis, we obtained
clinical information, imaging results, and follow-up in a compara￾tively large sample of LVAD recipients having undergone PET/CT.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Group
The study group consisted of 57 LVAD recipients, who were
consecutively referred for PET/CT between July 2015 and April 2017
for clinical assessment of the extent and severity of device infection
due to persisting local or systemic signs of infection. Demographics
and other patient characteristics are listed in Table 1. Nineteen patients
received repeated scans after 154 6 11 d of the prior scan (range, 39–
343 d) to reevaluate for suspected reappearance or progression of
infection. Between scans, there was a change of antibiosis in all but
one of the repeat imaging cases, 8 had antiinfective surgery, and 5 had
a complete change of the device. The resulting total of 85 scans was
used for correlative analysis of image-derived and clinical parameters
at the time of PET/CT, when indicated (scan-based analysis). All other
analyses, including outcome analyses, were performed on a patient-by￾patient basis (n 5 57). All patients gave written informed consent to
undergo PET/CT imaging. The ethical committee of Hannover Medical

School, after being informed of the retrospective analysis of the scan
results and clinical outcome, waived the requirement for a formal review.
PET/CT Imaging and Data Analysis
After 6 h of fasting and confirmation that blood glucose levels were
less than 8 mmol/L, 262 6 64 MBq of 18F-FDG were injected intra￾venously. After an uptake time of 60 min, whole-body PET scans were
acquired using a Biograph mCT 128 (Siemens Healthineers) with
continuous table motion, as previously described (11). A nonenhanced
low-dose CT scan was acquired for anatomic coregistration and atten￾uation correction. Noncorrected and attenuation-corrected images
were reconstructed using a resolution recovery iterative algorithm.
Foci of increased 18F-FDG uptake were visually identified by 2 expe￾rienced observers. A focus was graded as positive if it was signifi￾cantly elevated versus background in the regions of the device.
Consensus was obtained in cases of discrepancy. All foci of uptake
were confirmed as elevated versus background on non–attenuation￾corrected images to avoid artifacts induced by dense implant material
(12). Using volume-of-interest technique, peak SUVs were obtained
from attenuation-corrected scans to quantify the 18F-FDG uptake of
each focus. For localization of LVAD-specific infection, the LVAD
was subdivided into 4 components (consistent with International So￾ciety for Heart and Lung Transplantation recommendations (13)):
driveline entry point, subcutaneous driveline pathway, pump pocket,
and outflow tract (Fig. 1A). Additionally, SUVs were obtained for re￾gions remote from the LVAD. These included blood pool (aorta) and
liver to measure background; hematopoietic organs (spleen, bone mar￾row), which may be activated in systemic infection; and thoracic lymph
nodes with elevated 18F-FDG uptake. Finally, scans were systematically
analyzed for other LVAD-related or nonrelated inflammatory foci.
Clinical Data, Driveline Smears, and Follow-up
All LVAD recipients at Hannover Medical School undergo tight clinical
follow-up, with outpatient visits at least every 3 mo. Wound smears of the
driveline exit side were available at the time of PET/CT, performed by
highly experienced nurses according to a standardized protocol. On the
basis of this protocol, 99% of all driveline exit sites of newly implanted
LVAD patients showed a sterile result, confirming that contamination by
normal skin culture is successfully avoided. Regular clinical visits enabled
gathering of clinical follow-up data from hospital records, which were
obtained for all patients for 2 y after PET/CT or until the occurrence of an
event or another PET/CT scan (in cases of scan-based analysis only).
Recorded events included death, heart transplantation, LVAD replacement,
and any other surgical antiinfective intervention. Additionally, the length
of required hospital stays for inpatient care after PET/CT was recorded,
and systemic inflammatory markers and smear results from driveline entry
points were taken from patient records at the time of PET/CT.
Statistical Methods
Data were analyzed using MedCalc software. Results are reported
as average 6 SD for continuous variables or as median and range for
nonnormally distributed variables. Groups of normally distributed var￾iables were compared using t testing. Nonparametric Mann–Whitney
U testing was used if a normal distribution was not confirmed. Receiver￾operating-characteristic analysis was used to identify the relationship
between SUV at the driveline entry site and the results of microbial
smears as a reference. And finally, Kaplan–Meier analysis and log-rank
testing were used to identify predictors of outcome during follow-up. A
P value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS
18F-FDG PET/CT Identifies the Extent and Severity of
LVAD Infection
All scans showed visually detectable foci of 18F-FDG uptake
suggestive of LVAD-specific infection. Multiple LVAD compo￾nents were involved in most scans: 2 in 29 scans (34%), 3 in 28
(33%), and all 4 in 21 (25%). This result confirms the advanced
stage of infection in the studied patient group. Most often, elevated
18F-FDG uptake was found along the driveline (entry point, n 5
65, 77% of scans; subcutaneous driveline pathway, n 5 74, 87% of
scans), whereas intrathoracic components were also frequently
involved (pump pocket, n 5 42, 49% of scans; outflow tract,
n 5 49, 58% of scans). SUVs for foci at the 4 components (Table
2) showed a decline along the probable pathway of infection, with
the highest values being at the driveline entry and the lowest at the
outflow tract. Figures 1B–1D show PET/CT images representative
of infection for each of the 4 LVAD components.
Driveline entry point smears were available for 83 of 85 studies.
Pathogens were identified in 62 scans (75%) and revealed Staph￾ylococcus or Pseudomonas strains in most (respectively: n 5
30, 48% of positive cases, and n 5 21, 34% of positive cases).
Receiver-operating-characteristic analysis revealed an area under
the curve of 0.71 (P 5 0.004) for detecting a smear-positive

driveline entry point infection by elevated 18F-FDG uptake. An SUVpeak
of more than 2.5 was identified to be most accurate (Youden index,
0.41), yielding a sensitivity of 87% and specificity of 59%.
On analysis of remote regions, elevated focal 18F-FDG uptake
in draining intrathoracic lymph nodes was a frequent LVAD in￾fection–related finding (n 5 56, 66% of cases). A representative
PET/CT scan showing thoracic lymph node involvement is shown
in Figure 2. Of note, the extent and severity of 18F-FDG uptake at
LVAD components were not correlated with 18F-FDG uptake in
hematopoietic organs or systemic inflammatory markers at the
time of PET/CT (C-reactive protein, P 5 0.38; leukocyte count,
P 5 0.34). Sites of 18F-FDG uptake not related to LVAD infection
included the sternum, various joints, ribs, and muscles. No septic
emboli were identified in the study group.
PET/CT Results Predict Adverse Outcome
Fourteen of 57 patients (25%) died during follow-up. Death cer￾tificates identified sepsis as the underlying cause in 7 patients and
multiple-organ failure in 5 patients. Two
patients died during or immediately after
heart transplantation. The time between the
last PET/CT scan and death ranged from 13
to 466 d, with a median of 55 d. Ten patients
underwent heart transplantation at 72–334 d
after PET/CT (median, 158 d) and were cen￾sored at the time of transplantation for survival
analysis. Among various image-derived pa￾rameters, Kaplan–Meier analysis identified
a trend toward adverse outcome if infection
involved 3 or all 4 LVAD components (P 5
0.089 vs. 2 or fewer components; Fig. 3A).
Also, involvement of thoracic lymph nodes
was significantly associated with adverse
outcome (P 5 0.001 for nodal SUV above
vs. below median; Fig. 3B). Other markers,
including the SUV of any individual LVAD
component, the average SUV of all compo￾nents, uptake in spleen or bone marrow, or
detection of non-LVAD infection sites, were
not significantly associated with adverse
outcome.
Early Surgical Revision After PET/CT
Is Associated with Reduced
Inpatient Care
Surgical antiinfective procedures were
performed on 32 patients within the first
year after PET/CT. These included replace￾ment of LVAD components in 24 patients
(at 3–108 d after PET/CT; median, 15 d)
and targeted vacuum wound drainage in
the other patients. Among those 32, a group
of 21 patients received early surgery within
the first 3 mo after PET/CT (group 1; sur￾gery assumed to be driven by scan results),
whereas a group of 11 patients underwent
surgical procedures later than 3 mo after
PET/CT, after interval adaptation of medical
therapy (group 2; surgery assumed to be in￾dependent of scan results). The remaining
25 patients, who did not receive antiinfective
surgery, were disregarded for subsequent analysis because they reflect
a heterogeneous mixture of patients with less complicated cases (for
which continued or adapted systemic antibiotics were considered

to be sufficient; n 5 14), more severely affected patients who died
without surgery (n 5 5), or patients who received cardiac trans￾plantation (n 5 6).
Survival analysis showed no significant difference between group
1 (5 deaths; 24%) and group 2 (4 deaths; 36%) during follow-up.
But the recorded overall length of inpatient care time during the first
year after PET/CT differed significantly, showing significantly fewer
inpatient days for group 1 (99 6 87, vs. 158 6 130 d for group 2,
P 5 0.016; Fig. 4).
DISCUSSION
Our results confirm that 18F-FDG PET/CT enables detection of
the location, extent, and severity of LVAD-specific infection. 18F￾FDG also identifies LVAD infection–related involvement of thoracic
lymph nodes. Importantly, PET/CT results can be used to identify the
subjects at highest risk of an adverse outcome. If targeted surgical
revision of infected components is performed early after PET/CT,
and thus assumedly guided by imaging results, then the length of
subsequent in-hospital stays is significantly reduced. To our knowl￾edge, this report includes the largest single-center sample of 18F-FDG
PET/CT scans in subjects with LVAD infection to date. It should be
used as a foundation for subsequent prospective trials investigating
the effect of PET/CT-guided antiinfective
surgical therapy in the management of LVAD
recipients with advanced infection.
The instantaneous risk for LVAD infec￾tion peaks initially in the postsurgical phase
less than 30 d after implantation (5). At
subsequent times, it remains constantly ele￾vated at a lower level (5), contributing to a
steady increase of cumulative risk with in￾creasing duration of LVAD support. Our
study does not cover the early postsurgical
phase. Instead, it focuses on the value of
18F-FDG PET/CT in later-onset infections,
which are nevertheless known to have a sig￾nificant effect on survival (5,14,15). Patients
included in this analysis were in an ad￾vanced state of infection, as confirmed by
the high prevalence and extent of positive
scans (100% with at least 1 infected LVAD
component, 92% with at least 2, and .50% with 3 or 4 compo￾nents), by the high prevalence of LVAD-related lymph node involve￾ment, by the persistence of infection despite systemic antibiotic
therapy before PET/CT, and by the occurrence of all but 1 death
within the first 150 d after PET/CT (Fig. 3). This state likely
explains our observation that involvement of thoracic lymph nodes
as the infection-related drainage site from internal LVAD compo￾nents had the strongest prognostic value, whereas involvement of
internal components themselves showed a trend toward a signifi￾cant prognostic value but did not have the same discriminatory
prognostic power as nodal involvement or as recently reported by
another group in a different and smaller sample, for which the
focus was on early detection (16).
The state of advanced LVAD infection also represents a situation
in which effective therapy is difficult and may most strongly ben￾efit from guidance by imaging. It is generally assumed that LVAD
infection spreads from the driveline entry point toward the inner
components of the system. A revision or change of the driveline is
less complicated and risky than a complete exchange of the LVAD
system. However, driveline revision can be a meaningful therapy
only if it is done before the infection has reached the aggregate.
Here, the comprehensive PET/CT information is useful to guide
surgical revision to the infected LVAD components. In our pa￾tients, for example, an infection at the aggregate was found in
more than 50% of cases, suggesting that a pure driveline-directed
therapy would be incomplete for most. Importantly, our analysis
also showed that when targeted antiinfective surgery was pursued
early after PET/CT, there was a decreased need for inpatient care
in the subsequent year when compared with individuals who re￾ceived surgery at a later time (when the results of PET/CT were
not actual anymore). This finding suggests that the greatest value
of 18F-FDG PET/CT may lie in guidance of surgical therapy to the
appropriate infected LVAD components.
PET/CT had a relevant impact on clinical management in our
patient group because it not only guided targeted antiinfective
surgery in a subset of patients but also led to prioritization for
transplantation in some cases, or to continued or adapted antibiotic
therapy, presumably in those patients whose infection was con￾sidered less severe. Of note, the exact duration of antibiotic therapy
was not completely documented in our retrospective analysis, and
repeat imaging was obtained only if recurrence or progression of
infection was suspected. Therefore, valid conclusions about the

effect of antibiotics on the detection rate of PET/CT cannot be
derived from our study.
Some further limitations of our work need to be recognized:
First, this was a retrospective single-center analysis, with all the
inherent limitations of such. Although the sample size was larger
than that of previous original work reporting on PET/CT in LVAD
infection, the results still represent the local experience of our
referral center. Bias may have been introduced by the clinical use
of PET/CT in a more advanced state of infection and by the
resulting lack of patients with early or no infection for compar￾ison. The normal distribution of 18F-FDG around the LVAD and its
time course after implantation remain poorly defined and cannot
be derived from our study group. Also, the length of hospital stay
had to be used as a surrogate marker of outcome (17) after anti￾infective surgical revision, because differences in survival were not
detectable, probably because of the limited power of the still small
number of subjects. In addition, the formation of groups based on
time between PET/CT and surgery is based on the assumption that
an earlier scan will have a more direct effect on surgery, but this
assumption cannot be proven because of the retrospective design.
Likewise, factors other than time after PET/CT may have con￾founded the differences in subsequent hospital stay. Therefore, the
results of the present study should be seen as a hypothesis generator.
This hypothesis—that PET/CT-guided, targeted antiinfective ther￾apy may be beneficial in LVAD infection—clearly needs to be
confirmed in a subsequent prospective trial.
Second, this work did not focus on establishing the diagnostic
accuracy of 18F-FDG PET/CT in LVAD infection. Most prior
studies have focused on the accuracy of the test, suggesting high
sensitivity but lower specificity (8,18–20), and superiority when
compared with white blood cell scintigraphy (21). Yet, determi￾nation of diagnostic accuracy is highly dependent on the validity
and robustness of the reference standard (22), which is not free of
challenges in LVAD infection, where the proof of pathogens in
culture is complicated by sampling error and often longstanding
antibiotic therapy (23), and where indirect clinical parameters are
proposed as surrogate markers for the presence of infectious patho￾gens according to International Society for Heart and Lung Trans￾plantation consensus (13). We included an analysis of the driveline
entry point as an area that is easily accessible for smears, and we
used positive proof of pathogens from smears as the gold standard.
Thereby, we were able to determine PET/CT to have high sensitivity
and lower but acceptable specificity, both of
which were well within the range of prior
studies (8). The specificity of 18F-FDG for
infection is generally limited, because the
tracer does not detect bacteria directly and
is taken up by all metabolically active leuko￾cytes. Hence, sterile inflammation cannot be
distinguished from infection. The early post￾surgical phase, when sterile inflammation is
frequently observed because of reparative mech￾anisms, was excluded from our study. But de￾spite the focus on late-onset LVAD infection,
the subjects in our study were treated with
antibiotics and may have had local antiseptic
wound care, which may have reduced bacte￾ria beyond detectability by smears whereas
inflammatory cells taking up 18F-FDG may
still have been present. These factors may
have further contributed to compromised specificity. Also, we did
not include the driveline pathway, pump pocket. or outflow tract in
this analysis because structured data on pathogen detection were not
available for the internal locations. Nevertheless, although our sub￾analysis of accuracy may be limited, the major focus of this work
was to generate initial data on outcome prediction and modification
by imaging and image-guided therapy, and the prognostic value and
reduction of inpatient care are observations that stand as they are.
CONCLUSION
The present analysis of a comparatively large patient sample
from a single LVAD referral center confirms that 18F-FDG PET/CT
identifies the extent of advanced LVAD infection and predicts ad￾verse outcome. Initial experience also supports the notion that early
image-guided surgical intervention may facilitate a less complicated
subsequent course. The present work provides a foundation for the
design of subsequent prospective studies to confirm this hypothesis.

KEY POINTS
QUESTION: Can 18F-FDG PET/CT guide surgical therapy in LVAD
infection?
PERTINENT FINDINGS: 18F-FDG PET/CT yields accurate infor￾mation about the presence, severity, and extent of LVAD infection,
which predicts adverse outcome. If LVAD recipients undergo
surgical treatment early after (and guided by) PET/CT, they require
less inpatient care in the subsequent year.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PATIENT CARE: 18F-FDG PET/CT–guided
surgical therapy in LVAD infection may improve outcome and re￾duce complicated patient courses.
