Abstract
Resumo
Portal vein thrombosis refers to complete or partial obstruction of the portal venous system, in the intrahepatic or extrahepatic 
venous tract or even in the splenic or superior mesenteric veins. This common and potentially fatal condition can develop in various 
clinical contexts, especially those of liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and other solid tumors. Certain characteristics, such 
as the time since the onset of the thrombus (acute or chronic), its biology (hematic or tumoral), the presence of collateral vessels, 
and the magnetic resonance imaging aspects, are important components of a thorough, careful analysis, as well as informing deci￾sions regarding the appropriate therapeutic strategy. Here, we present a brief review of the anatomy of the portal venous system 
and a systematic approach to analyzing the condition, using a mnemonic (ABCD, for age, biology, collaterals, and diffusion). We 
discuss the various imaging methods and illustrate our discussion with images selected from the case files archived at our facility.

Trombose da veia porta refere-se à obstrução completa ou parcial do sistema venoso portal, localizada nos tratos venosos 
intra-hepáticos ou extra-hepáticos e até mesmo nas veias esplênica ou mesentérica superior. Vários contextos clínicos podem 
ser responsáveis pelo desenvolvimento desta condição frequente e potencialmente fatal, especialmente a cirrose hepática, o 
carcinoma hepatocelular e outros tumores sólidos. Algumas características como o tempo de aparecimento do trombo (agudo ou 
crônico), sua biologia (hemático ou tumoral), a presença de vasos colaterais e o seu comportamento na ressonância magnética 
são importantes para uma análise completa e criteriosa, assim como para o gerenciamento adequado da estratégia terapêutica. 
No presente artigo apresentamos breve revisão da anatomia do trato venoso portal, seguida de uma abordagem sistemática 
usando um mnemônico (ABCD) para análise da trombose da veia porta por diferentes métodos de imagem, utilizando imagens de 
casos selecionados do arquivo de ensino do nosso serviço.

ranging from 80% to 100%(4,5). When portal vein thrombo￾sis is suspected, ultrasound is the first-line method, with 
an estimated accuracy of 88–98%, CT or MRI being used 
in patients with an inadequate acoustic window or when 
there is a need for better assessment of the extent of the 
thrombus and the portosystemic collaterals, as well as for 
the detection of abdominal neoplasms(2,5,6).
In this article, we present a systematic approach us￾ing a mnemonic (ABCD, for age, biology, collaterals, and 
diffusion). The objective is to enable a complete analysis 
of portal venous thrombosis, regardless of the imaging em￾ployed.
ANATOMY OF THE PORTAL VENOUS SYSTEM
The portal vein forms posteriorly to the neck of the 
pancreas, at the junction of the splenic and superior mes￾enteric veins(7,8). In the hepatic hilum, it divides into right 
and left branches, which insert into the liver, projecting 
INTRODUCTION
Portal vein thrombosis is the most common cause 
of prehepatic portal hypertension, classically defined as 
partial or complete obstruction of the portal vein lumen. 
Anatomically, it can occur in the intrahepatic or extra￾hepatic portal venous tract and can involve the superior 
mesenteric vein, the splenic vein, or both(1,2). Factors that 
compose the Virchow triad (hypercoagulability, endothe￾lial dysfunction, and stasis), especially liver cirrhosis and 
neoplastic conditions, primarily hepatocellular carcinoma 
(HCC), can predispose to portal vein thrombosis(1,3). The 
clinical presentation is quite variable, and patients can 
even be asymptomatic, which limits its diagnosis and clas￾sification when only clinical findings are considered(3).
Ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) are the imaging methods used 
in order to facilitate the diagnosis and classification of por￾tal vein thrombosis, with rates of sensitivity and specificity

a portal branch into the center of each hepatic segment 
(Figure 1). The splenic vein originates from the junction 
of its tributaries in the splenic hilum and receives the 
short gastric, left gastroepiploic, inferior mesenteric, and 
posterior pancreatic veins. The superior mesenteric vein 
is formed by tributaries that drain the colonic segments 
on the right, the small intestine, and the head of the pan￾creas. The left gastric vein connects directly to the portal 
vein at its origin. Other tributaries, such as the right gas￾tric, cystic, accessory pancreatic, and superior pancreati￾coduodenal veins, are also received by the portal vein(7–9), 
as depicted in Figure 2.
SYSTEMATIC RADIOLOGICAL APPROACH 
TO PORTAL VEIN THROMBOSIS
A (age)
Portal vein thrombosis is classified as acute or chronic 
depending on the time since its onset. However, it is dif￾ficult to define the time of onset on the basis of clinical pa￾rameters. In addition to fact that it can be asymptomatic, 
the duration of symptoms has been shown to be an un￾reliable indicator of the time of onset of the condition(5). 
Therefore, the use of imaging methods is a feasible and 
indispensable approach to making the differentiation be￾tween acute and chronic cases of portal vein thrombosis.
On ultrasound, an acute thrombus usually appears as 
heterogeneous material in the vessel lumen, accompanied 
by an increase in the caliber of the portal vein (to > 13 mm). 
In some cases, the thrombus is hypoechoic or isoechoic, 
and, on color Doppler, there is an absence of blood flow 
in part or all of the lumen(9,11), as shown in Figure 3A. 
As the thrombus ages and becomes chronic, its content 
becomes more echogenic, with calcifications or cavernous 
transformation, which is defined as the formation of collat￾eral vessels that bypass the obstruction, exhibiting multiple 
serpiginous structures with flow on color Doppler, in the 
periportal region(9,11), as can be seen in Figures 3B and 3C. 
Despite being characteristic of the chronic phase, the ap￾pearance of a thrombus at 6–20 days after the acute event 
has been reported(11). In the absence of cirrhosis or other 
concomitant causes of portal hypertension, signs of severe 
portal hypertension, such as ascites, splenomegaly, and 
portosystemic collaterals, also suggest chronicity.
On CT, the acute form of portal vein thrombosis pres￾ents as increased portal vein attenuation in the pre-con￾Figure 1. Coronal CT reconstruction showing the portal venous system. The 
main portal vein (black asterisk) is formed by the union of the splenic vein 
(white arrow) and the superior mesenteric vein (white asterisk). The right and 
left portal branches divide within the hepatic hilum (black arrowheads). Other 
tributaries include the inferior mesenteric vein (black arrow) and the gastric 
veins (white arrowhead).

(black asterisk) and superior mesenteric vein (white asterisk), directly receives 
the right and left gastric veins (arrowheads). The inferior mesenteric vein 
(curved arrow) drains directly into the splenic vein. (Adapted from Netter(10)).

trast phase, a lack of enhancement after administration of 
intravenous contrast, and increased portal vein caliber(4), 
as illustrated in Figure 3D. In the chronic form, the throm￾bosed vessel can be hypodense, containing linear calcifica￾tions, or obliterated, with cavernous transformation(4,11). 
In candidates for liver transplantation, calcifications in the 
portal vein should be actively investigated, because they in￾dicate a more fragile vessel and can complicate the surgical 
procedure(4,5).
Total or partial filling defects in the portal venous sys￾tem can be detected on MRI, especially in the portal phase. 
On T1-weighted images, acute thrombi can be isointense 
to the muscle tissue or hyperintense when newly formed, 
whereas they continue to show high signal intensity on 
T2-weighted images (Figure 3E). Chronic thrombi tend to 
be hypointense or appear as a flow void, although a slow 
flow artifact can change the signal to isointense or hyper￾intense(6), as shown in Figures 3F and 3G.

caliber of which is increased, with slight peripheral blood flow on color Doppler (white arrow), the flow 
being related to partial occlusion and not being a flow within the thrombus (which differentiates it from 
a tumor thrombus). B: Schematic drawing showing the cavernous transformation of the portal vein.

B (biology)
Thrombi can be differentiated, in terms of biology 
or nature, as having a vascular or tumor nature. Vascular 
thrombi are usually secondary to slow flow in patients with 
cirrhosis, whereas tumor thrombi are related to invasion 
of a portal branch by a neoplasm. Despite the disparate 
pathophysiology, the two types can coexist, especially in 
patients with HCC(5). Tumor thrombosis is a common, 
well-reported complication of HCC and is considered one 
of the contraindications to liver transplantation, dramati￾cally altering the treatment options and prognosis(2,4,5).
On color Doppler, a tumor thrombus shows blood flow 
in its interior, with 100% specificity when the flow found 
is arterial (neovascularization), a finding that is absent 
in vascular thrombi(11). Neovascularization on CT is also 
highly specific and has been widely described as indicative 
of a tumor thrombus, which typically shows enhancement 
greater than 20 HU after contrast administration(12–14), 
as depicted in Figures 4A and 4B. Vascular thrombi show 
variable density, depending on their age, and do not show 
enhancement after contrast(7), as can be seen in Figures 
4C and 4D.
C (collaterals)
The absence of portosystemic collaterals and spleno￾megaly usually indicates acute thrombosis, although the 
presence of those signs does not automatically indicate 
chronic thrombosis, because they can be attributable to 
intrahepatic portal hypertension secondary to cirrhosis(5). 
The left gastric vein is responsible for the most com￾mon portosystemic shunt (Figure 5A), and a left gastric 
vein caliber > 6 mm is indicative of portal hypertension. 
Dilated vessels in the esophageal wall are known as esoph￾ageal varices, whereas those located adjacent to the esoph￾agus are known as paraesophageal varices(8), as illustrated 
in Figure 5B. 
In patients with portal hypertension, a recanalized 
umbilical vein can also be observed (Figure 5C), as can 
a splenorenal shunt(9), as shown in Figure 5D, and gall￾bladder wall varices, which are commonly seen in patients 
with cavernous transformation(8), as depicted in Figure 
5E. Other, less common shunts are deviation of the su￾perior mesenteric vein to the right renal vein, mesenteric 
varices, and collaterals to the diaphragm.

post-contrast phase). In addition, there 
is expansion of the vessel, also related 
to the tumor component. C: Axial CT

D (diffusion)
Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) can facilitate 
the qualitative and quantitative evaluation of portal vein 
thrombosis. The role of DWI in the differentiation be￾tween vascular and tumor thrombi was emphasized by 
Catalano et al.(6), who demonstrated that tumor thrombi

have signal intensity and apparent diffusion coefficient 
(ADC) values similar to those of the primary tumor, the 
signal being hyperintense on DWI, which shows restric￾tion, and hypointense on the ADC map(5,6), as depicted 
in Figures 6A and 6B. Vascular thrombi do not typical￾ly present restricted diffusion, except in cases of acute

hemorrhage, in which there is a “shine-through” effect 
with different hemoglobin degradation products, limiting 
and confounding the accurate analysis of the sequence. 
Therefore, DWI is an additional tool that, together with 
the determination of other characteristics, such as the 
caliber of the portal vein, tumor expansion, neovascu￾larization, the signal in the other (T1- and T2-weighted) 
sequences, and the signs of portal hypertension, helps 
differentiate between vascular and tumor thrombi(5,13,14).
CONCLUSION
Because of its morbidity and the limitations of the 
clinical evaluation, portal vein thrombosis demands care￾ful analysis by imaging methods. Important information 
should be extracted by the various imaging methods. By 
adopting the systematic ABCD approach, the data can be 
interpreted in a more careful and comprehensive manner.
