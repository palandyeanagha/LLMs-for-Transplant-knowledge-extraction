§
The gut microbiome is increasingly recognized as having fundamental 
roles in human physiology and health1,2
. A central question is the extent 
to which microbiome composition is determined by host genetics. 
Previous studies have identified several heritable bacterial taxa3–7 but 
the combined bacterial abundance accounted for by them has not yet 
been quantified. Other studies have found associations between host 
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and individual bacterial taxa 
or pathways5,8–11. However, most previously reported associations are 
not statistically significant after multiple testing correction3
. A recent 
study identified 42 SNPs that together explained 10% of the variance 
of microbiome β-diversity9
. However, the statistical significance of this 
result has not yet been evaluated. Thus, the extent to which human 
genetics shape microbiome composition remains unclear.
Here we studied microbial–genetic associations using a cohort of 
1,046 healthy Israeli individuals with metagenome-sequenced and 16S 
rRNA gene-sequenced gut microbiomes, genotypes, anthropometric 
and blood measurements, and dietary habits12. Individuals in our 
cohort are of several different ancestral origins but we assume, owing 
to their broadly similar lifestyles, that they share a relatively homoge￾neous environment.
Our results demonstrate that gut microbiome composition is shaped 
predominantly by environmental factors. Specifically, we show that 
the microbiome is not significantly associated with genetic ancestry 
or with individual SNPs, and that previously reported associations are 
not replicated across different studies. We further estimate that the 
average heritability of gut microbiome taxa is only 1.9%, by analysing 
data from 2,252 twins from the TwinsUK cohort6
. However, further and 
larger-scale studies are required to accurately quantify gut microbiome 
heritability.
To provide direct evidence that the microbiome is shaped largely 
by environmental factors, we show that there is significant similarity 
among the microbiomes of genetically unrelated individuals who share 
a household, but no significant microbiome similarity among relatives 
who do not have a history of household sharing. We further demon￾strate that over 20% of the variance in microbiome β-diversity can be 
inferred from environmental factors associated with diet and lifestyle, 
consistent with previous studies13,14.
Because our findings suggest that gut microbiome and host genetics 
are largely independent, we compare the power of the gut microbiome 
and of host genetics to predict host phenotypes. We define the term 
‘microbiome-association index’ (b2
) that—by analogy with genetic 
heritability, which is typically termed h2
—quantifies the overall asso￾ciation between the microbiome and a host phenotype after accounting 
for host genetics. We find significant b2
 levels of 22–36% for body mass 
index (BMI; 25%), fasting glucose levels (22%), glycaemic status (25%), 
levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (36%), waist cir￾cumference (29%), hip circumference (27%), waist–hip ratio (WHR; 
24%) and lactose consumption (36%). We note that b2
 should be inter￾preted with caution, because it is a correlative measure that does not 
necessarily indicate causality and it may be confounded by environ￾mental factors. We additionally demonstrate that using microbiome 
data together with human genetic data substantially improves the 
Human gut microbiome composition is shaped by multiple factors but the relative contribution of host genetics remains 
elusive. Here we examine genotype and microbiome data from 1,046 healthy individuals with several distinct ancestral 
origins who share a relatively common environment, and demonstrate that the gut microbiome is not significantly 
associated with genetic ancestry, and that host genetics have a minor role in determining microbiome composition. We 
show that, by contrast, there are significant similarities in the compositions of the microbiomes of genetically unrelated 
individuals who share a household, and that over 20% of the inter-person microbiome variability is associated with factors 
related to diet, drugs and anthropometric measurements. We further demonstrate that microbiome data significantly 
improve the prediction accuracy for many human traits, such as glucose and obesity measures, compared to models that 
use only host genetic and environmental data. These results suggest that microbiome alterations aimed at improving 
clinical outcomes may be carried out across diverse genetic backgrounds.

accuracy with which human phenotypes can be predicted, consistent 
with a previous smaller-scale study15.
Finally, we successfully replicate our results in 836 Dutch individu￾als, with genotypes and metagenomic data, from the LifeLines DEEP 
(LLD) cohort8
. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the gut 
microbiome is predominantly shaped by environmental factors, and 
is strongly correlated with many human phenotypes after accounting 
for host genetics.
Results
We studied a cohort of 1,046 healthy Israeli adults from whom we col￾lected blood for genotyping and phenotyping, stools for metagenome 
sequencing and 16S rRNA gene sequencing, anthropometric measure￾ments, and answers to food frequency and lifestyle questionnaires12
(Extended Data Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1). We performed 
genotyping at 712,540 SNPs and imputed them to 5,567,647 SNPs 
(Methods). Stool samples were profiled using both metagenome 
sequencing and 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and then analysed at 
multiple taxonomic levels; the results presented here are based on 
metagenome species analysis (results at metagenome phylum, class, 
order, family, genus or bacterial gene levels, and for 16S genus and 
operational taxonomic unit levels, are provided in Supplementary 
Tables where appropriate). We included covariates for age, gender, stool 
collection method, and self-reported daily median caloric, fat, protein 
and carbohydrate consumption (Methods).
Limited evidence of microbiome–genetic associations
Our sample consists of self-reported Ashkenazi (n=​ 508), North 
African (n=​ 64), Middle Eastern (n=​ 34), Sephardi (n=​ 19), Yemenite 
(n=​ 13) and ‘admixed/other’ (n=​ 408) ancestries16 (Supplementary 
Table 2). We first successfully verified that the top two host genetic 
principal components are strongly associated with self-reported 
ancestry (P<​ 10−32 for both principal component 1 and principal 
component 2, Kruskal–Wallis test; Fig. 1a, Extended Data Table 2 and 
Supplementary Table 3). By contrast, we found no significant asso￾ciation between ancestry and microbiome composition. Specifically, 
there was no significant correlation between any of the top five host 
genetic principal components and any of the top five microbiome 
β-diversity principal coordinates (PCOs, computed using Bray–
Curtis dissimilarity; P>​ 0.49 for all pairwise associations, Spearman 
correlation; Supplementary Table 4).
We also found no significant differences between ancestries in 
terms of microbiome composition (quantified by PCOs of Bray–
Curtis dissimilarities), α-diversity (quantified by the Shannon 
diversity index) or abundance of specific taxa (Kruskal–Wallis test 
for non-admixed individuals; Fig. 1b–d, Extended Data Table 2 and 
Supplementary Table 3). We obtained similar results when testing 
whether individuals who are more ancestrally similar, quantified 
by the fraction of grandparents from the same ancestry, have more 
similar microbiomes (quantified by Bray–Curtis dissimilarity), 
α-diversity or abundance of specific taxa (Mantel test17; Methods, 
Fig. 1e, Extended Data Table 2 and Supplementary Table 5). As a con￾trol, we verified that ancestrally similar individuals are significantly 
similar in terms of their genetics (P<​ 10−5
, Mantel test; Methods, 
Extended Data Table 2 and Supplementary Table 5). We also found no 
significant association between microbiome composition and genetic 
kinship (Fig. 2a, Extended Data Table 2 and Supplementary Table 6), 
though we note that SNP-based kinship tests are less powerful than 
ancestry-based tests (Supplementary Tables 7–10 and Supplementary 
Information).
One caveat of our study is the presence of imbalanced per-population 
sample sizes. Although an ideal study should have equal per-population 
sample sizes, we verified that our study is well-powered to detect 
microbiome–ancestry associations. Specifically, we found that the 
probability of finding a statistically significant microbiome–ancestry 
association is 70% if only 10% of the microbiome variance is explained 
by ancestry, and is greater than 90% if over 30% of the microbiome 
variance is explained by ancestry (Supplementary Information).
The lack of association between microbiome composition and 
genetic ancestry suggests that the microbiome is not strongly associated 
with host genetics. Because twin studies are ideal for heritability 
estimation18, we analysed a previously studied6
 dataset of 2,252 twins 
to directly quantify microbiome heritability. First, we found that the 
sum of the relative abundances of all 33 taxa reported as significantly 
heritable in the previous study6
 accounted for only 5.6% of total micro￾biome composition (Methods). Next, we estimated the overall micro￾biome heritability using the formula H r = ∑ ∈ h t S t t 2 2
, in which rt and ht
2
are the relative abundance and estimated heritability of taxon t, respec￾tively, and S is the set of significantly heritable taxa (making sure not 
to count the same taxon multiple times; see Methods). The resulting 
heritability estimate was only 1.9% or, at most, 8.1% when performing

no correction for multiple testing in the definition of S (Fig. 2b and 
Supplementary Table 11). These numbers serve as estimates of the 
lower and upper bound of the true overall microbiome heritability.
In addition, we applied several machine-learning algorithms to 
predict ancestry proportions from microbiomes, but none were 
successful (prediction R2<​ 0.01 for all ancestries; Methods). We also 
tried to predict top microbiome PCOs from ancestral or genetic data, 
and again found no significant associations (P>​ 0.1, permutation 
testing; Methods and Supplementary Table 12).
Finally, we verified that similar results are obtained when 
repeating the above experiments using any of the following: other 
metagenome-derived taxonomic and functional levels (phylum, class, 
order, family, genus and bacterial genes; see Methods); 16S rRNA 
gene sequencing; Unifrac- and Jaccard-based dissimilarity measures; 
non-metric multidimensional scaling17 instead of principal coordi￾nate analysis; dichotomization of relative abundance into presence/
absence patterns; and when omitting covariates (Extended Data Fig. 1
and Supplementary Tables 3–6, 12).
We next investigated associations between individual SNPs and 
microbiome β-diversity, using a distance-based F test19 (Extended 
Data Fig. 2 and Methods). This analysis found two loci with marginal 
genome-wide significance (rs6563994, P=​ 3×​ 10−8
; rs13149273, 
P=​ 4.2×​ 10−8
). However, as we show later, we could not replicate 
these findings in an additional cohort. In addition, our data did not 
replicate any of the 42 SNPs previously reported9
 as being significantly 
associated with microbiome β-diversity, either when using an F test or 
the previously applied method9
 (P>​ 0.05 for all previously reported 
SNPs; Methods).
The previous study9
 reported that these 42 SNPs could be used to 
infer 10% of the β-diversity variance, but did not report the statistical 
significance of this result. We were able to explain 12.1% of β-diversity 
variance using the 42 SNPs that were most closely associated with 
β-diversity in our own data, but this result was not statistically 
significant under permutations (P=​ 0.74; Methods). We conclude that 
inferring >10% of β-diversity variance using top-ranked SNPs may 
be an inherent property of the method used rather than a biologically 
meaningful result. Thus, we find very limited evidence in our data for 
the association of any individual SNP with microbiome β-diversity.
We next tested for associations between individual SNPs and 
specific taxa, using a linear mixed model (LMM) and dichotomiza￾tion of zero-inflated taxa (Methods; Supplementary Table 13). This 
analysis identified 43 loci with P <​ 5 ×​ 10−8
, but none remained 
statistically significant at a false discovery rate (FDR) of 5% (Fig. 3a
and Supplementary Table 14).
We also investigated the association of 225 SNPs in 211 loci reported 
as significantly associated with specific taxa or with β-diversity in any of 
five previous studies5,6,8–10 (Methods). To maximize replication power, 
we used the minimal P value obtained for each SNP across all taxa 
belonging to the same phylum. Only 7 of the 211 loci (3.3%) replicated 
at P<0.05/211 (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Table 15; Methods). Two 
of these seven loci are found close to the LCT gene, which encodes 
the lactase enzyme that enables lactose consumption, and were found 
by previous studies6–10 to be associated with Bifidobacterium, possibly 
owing to its association with lactose consumption.
Notably, the LCT gene is the only case in which there was an 
overlap between the SNPs reported in any pair of the five previous 
studies5,6,8–10. Moreover, no pair of previously reported SNPs from 
any two studies were within 100kb of one another, or within 1Mb of 
one another and associated with at least one bacterial taxa of the same 
phylum (Supplementary Table 15).
Microbiome–environment associations
We next investigated whether 24 pairs of related individuals—using 
second-to-fifth-degree relatives—with no history of household sharing 
had a similar microbiome composition, when compared to non-related 
pairs with no household sharing (using Bray–Curtis dissimilarity). We 
found no such evidence of similar microbiomes (P>0.4, permutation 
testing; Methods; Extended Data Fig. 3, Supplementary Table 16). By 
contrast, when investigating 55 first-degree-relative pairs, who are likely 
to have a history of household sharing, we found significant similarities 
in their microbiomes at the genus and species taxonomic levels, and 
at the level of bacterial genes (P<5×10−3
, Methods; Extended Data 
Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 16).
To test the effect of recent household sharing, we repeated the above 
analysis for 32 pairs of genetically unrelated individuals who reported 
sharing a household, and again found significant microbiome similari￾ties at the level of species and of bacterial genes (P<​ 2×​ 10−3
; Extended 
Data Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 16).
These results suggest that past or present household sharing may 
partly determine gut microbiome composition, whereas we find very 
little supporting evidence for microbiome similarities among relatives 
with no past household sharing. Our results corroborate previous 
studies20, including a recent twin study that showed that the gut 
microbiomes of twins become more genetically dissimilar over time 
when living apart11, and another study that showed that microbiome 
similarity among monozygotic twins compared to dizygotic twins is 
only marginally significant4
 (P=0.032 under an unweighted UniFrac 
dissimilarity, P >​ 0.05 under Bray–Curtis and weighted UniFrac 
dissimilarity).
We next directly quantified the fraction of microbiome β-diversity 
variance that can be inferred from environmental factors (based on 
Bray–Curtis dissimilarities) using answers to food frequency, lifestyle 
and drug use questions, as well as blood measurements, self-reported 
median daily intake of calories, protein, fat and carbohydrates, age, 
gender, glycaemic status, BMI, fasting glucose levels and the top 5 host 
genetic principal components (Methods; Supplementary Table 17).
We used a feature-selection algorithm that selected 95 environmen￾tal features that together could be used to infer 20.03% of the variance 
of microbiome β-diversity via PERMANOVA21 (Methods, P<​ 0.002; 
Extended Data Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 18), consistent with 
previous studies13,14. By contrast, host SNPs could not be used to infer a 
statistically significant fraction of β-diversity variance (P=​ 0.11, Methods).
Microbiome–phenotype associations
We next investigated how well host phenotypes can be inferred on the 
basis of the microbiome as compared to host genetics. The fraction of 
phenotypic variance that can be inferred from the microbiome after 
accounting for other explanatory variables including host genetics (that

is, b2
), represents a formal measure of predictability: larger b2
 values 
indicate that the microbiome is more informative with respect to a 
phenotype of interest. We estimate the value of b2
 in a narrow sense 
that cannot capture gene–gene or gene–environment interactions, as 
is common in heritability estimation22 (Supplementary Information).
Heritability estimation is typically performed in an LMM 
framework23 and requires a kinship matrix, which is typically estimated 
from SNPs24. We define the analogous bacterial kinship matrix on the 
basis of bacterial genes (Methods). We note, however, that the results 
may be confounded by unmeasured environmental factors, and that b2
cannot be used to determine causality because microbiome composi￾tion can both affect and be affected by host phenotypes.
We used FIESTA25 to verify that b2
 is consistently estimated in a more 
reliable fashion than h2
 for a given sample size, and that samples as 
large as 4,000 individuals are required for h2
 estimates to be as accurate 
as the b2
 estimate obtained in our cohort of 715 unrelated genotyped 
individuals (based on previous genetic data26, Methods; Fig. 4a and 
Supplementary Table 19). We conclude that b2
 estimation is more accu￾rate than h2
 estimation for a given sample size, and can be carried out 
with hundreds rather than thousands of individuals.
We next estimated b2
 for several phenotypes of interest (Extended 
Data Table 1), and used polygenic risk scores (PRS) based on summary 
statistics as an additional covariate to account for host genetic factors 
(Methods; Supplementary Table 20). We found 8 of the 12 traits we 
investigated to be significantly associated with the microbiome, after 
accounting for age, gender, diet and host genetics, with estimated b2
levels of 36% for non-fasting HDL cholesterol levels, 36% for lactose 
consumption, 29% for waist circumference, 27% for hip circumference, 
25% for BMI, 25% for glycaemic status, 24% for WHR and 22% for 
fasting glucose (Methods; Fig. 4b, c, Extended Data Fig. 5a, d, g, j and 
Supplementary Tables 21, 22). These b2
 estimates are comparable to 
previous SNP heritability estimates27–34 (Fig. 4b and Supplementary 
Table 21), which indicates that the microbiome is strongly associated 
with these traits.
To provide another comparison between host genetics and microbi￾ome, we evaluated the ability of a linear prediction model (Methods) 
to predict human phenotypes from bacterial gene abundances, PRS, 
age, sex, as well as daily median caloric, carbohydrate, fat and pro￾tein consumption. The contribution of a specific data source to the 
phenotype can be assessed by the reduction in prediction power when 
excluding this data source. We found that the prediction accuracy for 
10 of the 12 traits we investigated—including BMI, HDL cholesterol 
and fasting glucose levels—is substantially improved when microbiome 
data is added to PRS (Fig. 4d, Extended Data Fig. 5b, c, e, f, h, i, k, l
and Supplementary Table 23). Moreover, the contribution of both data 
sources is largely additive, consistent with our finding that microbiome 
and host genetics are largely independent of one another (Fig. 4e).
Taken together, these results demonstrate that host genetics and 
microbiome are complementary for predicting host phenotypes, and 
that phenotype prediction can be substantially improved by using both 
host genetics and microbiome data.
Independent validation on the LLD cohort
To verify that our results are broadly applicable across different study 
designs and populations, we repeated our analyses on a cohort of 836 
Dutch individuals from the LLD cohort8
, with metagenome-sequenced 
gut microbiomes, genotypes and the same covariates that we used in 
our analysis of the Israeli cohort.
In the LLD cohort, as in the Israeli cohort, there were no statistically 
significant associations between top host genetic principal components 
and microbiome PCOs (Supplementary Table 24), or between genetic 
kinship and microbiome β-diversity or bacterial taxa (Supplementary 
Table 25). A meta-analysis of both studies did not yield significant 
associations (Methods). Notably, the combined dataset is the largest 
cohort (1,551 individuals) of genotypes and metagenomic sequenced 
gut microbiomes analysed to date.
Next, we searched for significant associations between SNPs and 
microbiome β-diversity in the LLD cohort via the distance-based F
test19 but could not replicate the two marginally-significant loci found 
in the Israeli cohort. Two loci had a genome-wide significance 
(P<​ 5×​ 10−8
) in the LLD cohort (Supplementary Table 26). One of 
these SNPs (rs4988235) is associated with lactase persistence, was 
replicated in the Israeli cohort (P=​ 0.018) and has previously been 
reported in microbiome–genetic association studies6–8,10. This was also 
the only genome-wide significant SNP in a meta-analysis of the Israeli 
and LLD cohorts (P=​ 2.2×10−9
), and is the only SNP reported by 
multiple studies as being associated with the gut microbiome. Thus, 
multiple lines of evidence suggest that rs4988235 is the SNP most 
strongly associated with gut microbiome composition.
Next, we found that all phenotypes that were significantly associated 
with the microbiome in the Israeli cohort, according to the b2
 measure, 
were also significantly associated in the LLD cohort, with the exception 
of WHR (Extended Data Fig. 5m and Supplementary Table 27). We 
performed phenotype predictions using the LLD cohort, and observed 
results highly similar to those obtained when using data from the Israeli 
cohort (Extended Data Fig. 5n, o and Supplementary Table 28).
Overall, we conclude that there is considerable congruency between 
the results obtained in the two cohorts, despite the substantial differ￾ences in the study populations, data collection method and processing 
pipeline. This demonstrates that our results are robust to diverse 
populations and experimental settings.
Discussion
In this study we used a range of statistical analyses across multiple 
cohorts, all of which led to the conclusion that the environment has a 
substantially greater role than host genetics in shaping the human gut 
microbiome. Several recent studies have reported that the microbiome 
is not only stable over time35,36 but also—to some extent—resilient to 
perturbations such as antibiotics and pathogens37; the extent and deter￾minants of such stability remain unresolved. As a small minority of 
heritable microbes are unlikely to generate this stability, it will be inter￾esting to discover which mechanisms underlie microbiome stability 
and which perturbations cause the dysbiosis that can lead to disease 
susceptibility.
We proposed b2
 as a means of quantifying microbiome association 
with host phenotypes, and showed that b2
 can be reliably estimated

using metagenomic cohorts of only hundreds of individuals; we then 
found that several phenotypes exhibit substantial b2
 levels, in the range 
of 22–36%. Finally, we showed that adding microbiome data to host 
genetics data improves prediction accuracy for several host phenotypes, 
and that the two data sources contribute additively. We note that b2
should be interpreted with caution as it is a correlative measure and 
may be confounded by environmental factors.
Previous studies have identified heritable bacteria by observing 
co-occurrence among family members4–6,11, or by reporting associa￾tions between specific SNPs and bacterial taxa5,6,8–11. Our results are 
consistent with these published data, and collectively suggest that only 
a small number of bacterial taxa are likely to be strongly heritable, and 
that most SNP–bacteria associations are either weak or population￾dependent. Our re-analysis of a recent study of twins6
 estimates that 
the overall microbiome heritability lies between 1.9% and 8.1%. Future 
studies with larger sample sizes will probably identify additional 
heritable taxa and SNP associations, but are unlikely to change the 
overall conclusion that microbiome composition is predominantly 
shaped by non-genetic factors.

RESEARCH Article
Methods
No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. The experiments 
were not randomized and investigators were not blinded to allocation during 
experiments and outcome assessment.
Description of cohorts. This study used a previously described12 cohort of individ￾uals collected in Israel. Study participants were healthy individuals aged between 18 
and 70 (for full inclusion and exclusion criteria, see previous description12). Before 
the study, participants answered medical, lifestyle and nutritional questionnaires. 
All participants were monitored by a continuous glucometer (CGM) for seven 
days. During this period, participants were instructed to record all daily activities, 
including standardized and real-life meals, in real-time using their smartphones. 
All participants were genotyped using Illumina OMNI-EXPRESS array and 
provided stool samples, which were collected using a swab (88% of the individuals) 
or an OMNIGENE-GUT (12% of the individuals; OMR-200; DNA Genotek) stool 
collection kit. The stool samples were metagenome-sequenced using Illumina 
NextSeq and HiSeq, and 16S rRNA gene sequenced as previously described12. 
We validated that SNPs extracted from human reads in pre-filtered metagenomic 
sequences matched SNPs extracted from the blood of their human host. We further 
verified that the stool collection method did not confound our results by repeating 
all analyses using only stool samples collected via swab, which yielded results nearly 
identical to those obtained under the full dataset (results not shown).
The replication LifeLines DEEP cohort includes 1,539 individuals (636 males 
and 903 females, age range 18–84 years) from the north Netherlands. We included 
836 participants in the analysis, after excluding related individuals, unhealthy indi￾viduals and individuals without genotype data or metagenomics sequencing data.
Genome-wide genotyping for the LLD participants was performed using 
Illumina HumanCytoSNP-12 and Immunochip arrays, and then imputed using 
Haplotype Reference Consortium server with HRC 1.0 panel. Metagenomics 
sequencing was performed using the Illumina HiSeq platform. Within 2 weeks 
of participants giving a blood sample, they collected faecal samples at home and 
stored them immediately at −20 °C. After transport to the research laboratory 
on dry ice, faecal samples were stored at −80°C. Aliquots were made, and DNA 
was isolated with the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini kit (Qiagen, 80204) with the addi￾tion of mechanical lysis. Reads were quality-filtered, and adapter removal was 
performed using Trimmomatic39 (v.0.32). An average of 3.0 Gb of data (around 
32.3million high-quality reads) was obtained per sample. Reads belonging to the 
human genome were removed by mapping the data to the human reference genome 
(version NCBI37) with Bowtie240 (v.2.1.0). The profile of microbial composition 
was determined using MetaPhlAn41 2.2.
Genotypes preprocessing and imputation. We performed stringent quality 
control in our initial set of 862 genotyped individuals and 712,540 SNPs. We 
excluded SNPs with a missingness rate >5%, Hardy–Weinberg P<​ 10−9
, minor 
allele frequency <5%, P<​ 0.01 for differential missingness between two batches 
of individuals, or a logistic regression P<10−6
 for separation of the two batches, 
yielding 545,325 SNPs for subsequent analyses. We additionally excluded 
individuals with >10% missing SNPs, leaving 833 individuals.
Genotypes were pre-phased using EAGLE242 without a reference panel, and 
imputed using IMPUTE243 using the 1000 genomes dataset44 and 128 Ashkenazi 
Jewish individuals45 as reference panels. We retained only SNPs with imputation 
probability >90%, and applied the filtering stages above to the imputed data, 
yielding 5,567,647 imputed SNPs.
Microbial preprocessing. Preprocessing of 16S rRNA gene sequencing was 
performed as previously described12, with the addition of rarefaction to 10,000 
reads. Weighted and unweighted UniFrac matrices for 16S rRNA gene sequencing 
samples were computed using QIIME via the beta_diversity script46.
For metagenome analysis, we filtered metagenomic reads containing Illumina 
adapters, filtered low-quality reads and trimmed low-quality read edges. We 
detected host DNA by mapping with GEM47 to the human genome (hg19) with 
inclusive parameters, and removed human reads. We subsampled all samples to 
have at most 10million reads. Relative abundances from metagenomic sequencing 
were computed using MetaPhlAn241 with default parameters. MetaPhlAn relative 
abundances were capped at a level of 10−4
. We removed individuals with <15 
observed species from the analysis. After all genotyping and metagenomics 
quality-control steps, 946 individuals with metagenomics data remained, 814 
of whom were genotyped. Unless stated otherwise, we additionally excluded 
individuals self-reported to share a household and related individuals (using up 
to three degrees of relationship) from the analysis, yielding n=​ 715 genotyped 
individuals (Supplementary Table 1).
When testing for associations between specific taxa and specific SNPs, we 
log-transformed the data and used only taxa present in at least 5% of individuals 
in our cohort, which left 7/18 (remaining/total) phyla, 13/28 classes, 17/43 orders, 
35/96 families, 80/221 genera and 184/652 species.
Gene mapping. We performed gene mapping for the gene-based analyses by 
computing the length-normalized relative abundances of genes, obtained by 
similarity mapping with GEM to the gene reference catalogue48 followed by 
abundance correction using an iterative algorithm based on Pathoscope49, and 
normalization to sum to 1.0, using single-end reads.
Fasting glucose phenotyping. In the b2
 and phenotype prediction analyses, the 
fasting glucose phenotype was taken from data recorded by CGMs over the course 
of a week, as previously described12. The median glucose measurement over a 
period of 30min from self-reported wake-up time was used as a surrogate measure 
for fasting glucose.
Glycaemic status. For each patient we computed a quantity which we term 
glycaemic status’ that can serve as an indicator of hyperglycaemia, based on HbA1c, 
fasting glucose, response to standardized meals12, and top glucose percentiles 
and glucose noise as obtained from the CGM over the course of one week. Each 
individual was first ranked according to each feature. The glycaemic status of each 
individual was defined as the median of the ranks of (i) HbA1c; (ii) fasting glucose; 
(iii) median response to standardized meals; (iv) median of 90%, 95% and 98% glucose 
percentiles; and (v) glucose noise. We used fasting glucose summary statistics as a 
surrogate measure for the PRS of this measure.
Lactose consumption computations. We computed an estimate of average 
monthly lactose consumption (in grams), using a questionnaire of consumption 
frequency of 23 dairy products. As lactose consumption was exponentially dis￾tributed in our data, we log-transformed it to induce normality for the b2
 and 
phenotype prediction analyses.
Genetic kinship, principal components and relatedness estimation. We used 
PC-Relate50 for estimating genetic kinship and PC-AiR51 for genetic principal 
components computation, as these tools are robust to the presence of relatedness 
and admixture. We used a filtered dataset of 75,384 SNPs in approximate linkage 
equilibrium (r
2<0.15), and ran an iterative estimation procedure (with the initial 
kinship estimates provided by KING-Robust52) until the principal components 
computation converged, as previously described53. We estimated the degree of 
relatedness between individuals using their kinship coefficient and previously 
proposed cutoffs52. In the analysis of the LLD cohort and when testing kinship–
ancestry associations, we used the kinship matrix estimated by GCTA24, as the 
kinship matrix of PC-Relate is by definition not associated with ancestry.
Mantel tests. Mantel tests used were performed with 100,000 permutations. 
When associating a matrix with a vector, we constructed a distance matrix for the 
vector using Euclidean distances. When not using covariates, we used a Spearman 
correlation-based Mantel test. In the presence of covariates, we performed a 
Pearson correlation-based partial Mantel test (performed by first regressing 
the matrix of covariate differences out of the two compared matrices, and then 
performing a Mantel test on the resulting residualized matrices), according to 
previous recommendations54. When testing association with specific taxa, we 
excluded taxa present in <5% of individuals.
Ancestry proportions prediction. We attempted to predict ancestry proportions 
from microbiome composition using a variety of different techniques: Ridge 
regression55, lasso regression55 and extreme gradient boosting56. We used as 
features either the top 100 PCOs of the Bray–Curtis dissimilarity matrix, the 
raw bacterial abundances (under various taxonomic levels) transformed to 
a logarithmic scale or the principal components of presence/absence of genes. 
Prediction accuracy was measured via a tenfold cross validation. The hyper￾parameters of the methods were determined in each fold via cross validation, using 
only the training set of each fold.
Microbiome principal coordinates prediction. We attempted to predict top 
microbiome PCOs from ancestry proportions or host genotypes via ridge regres￾sion, which is robust to high-dimensional data, with covariates used as additional 
explanatory variables. We computed P values via permutation testing with 10,000 
permutations; in each permutation we assigned to each individual the microbiome 
PCOs of a random individual. The P value was defined as the number of permuta￾tions in which the sum of the coefficients of determination across the top 2, 5 or 10 
PCOs was greater than that obtained under the non-permuted data.
Analysis of data from twins study. We estimated the overall microbiome herit￾ability and the abundance of heritable taxa, using a previously published6
 dataset 
of 2,252 twins. Our analysis is based on two principles: First, we define the ‘overall 
microbiome heritability’ as a weighted average of taxa-specific heritabilities. The 
weight of each taxa is determined by its relative abundance in the TwinsUK data, 
and its heritability estimate is taken from the previous analysis6
. Second, we assume 
that only a subset of bacterial taxa is heritable. Therefore, we include only a subset 
of taxa in the weighted average computation, corresponding to taxa with heritability 
P values (as previously computed6
) smaller than a given cutoff.
We considered two cutoffs: a 5% FDR cutoff, and a liberal 5% false-positive rate 
cutoff, with no multiple testing corrections. The first cutoff probably yields a subset

of the truly heritable taxa, and the second cutoff probably yields a subset with all 
heritable taxa as well as many non-heritable taxa. The heritability estimates using 
these two subsets therefore serve as lower and upper bounds, respectively, on the 
overall microbiome heritability estimate.
Given a subset of taxa considered as significantly heritable, we estimated the 
overall heritability by using a weighted average of the estimated heritabilities of 
operational taxonomic units (OTUs) associated with these taxa, weighted by the 
relative abundances of these OTUs. The resulting quantity was then averaged across 
individuals. The estimated heritability of an OTU was the maximal heritability 
estimate among all heritable taxa with which it was associated.
Testing for SNP–microbiome associations using the vegan package. We repeated 
previously proposed9
 techniques for testing SNP–microbiome associations and 
estimating the variance inferred by several SNPs using the envfit and ordiR2step 
functions, respectively, in the vegan package in R54.
Permutation testing for the fraction of genus β-diversity variance that can be 
inferred from the top 42 SNPs (corresponding to the number used in the previous 
analysis9
) was carried out as follows. We performed 10,000 permutation analyses. 
In each analysis we (i) randomly assigned to each individual the genotype of a ran￾domly selected individual; (ii) ranked all SNPs according to their association with 
microbiome β-diversity, using the envfit function; and (iii) estimated the fraction 
of β-diversity variance that can be inferred from the combined top 42 SNPs, using 
the ordiR2step function. The resulting P value was the fraction of permutations in 
which the fraction of inferred variance was greater than observed under the real data.
Testing for SNP associations with individual taxa. We tested for associations 
between individual bacteria and individual SNPs using FaST-LMM38. We used 
all 814 genotyped individuals who passed quality control, including related 
individuals and individuals with a shared household, and controlled for these 
potential confounding sources using two variance components that encode 
kinship (as computed via PC-Relate50) and household sharing (using a binary 
co-sharing covariance matrix). When testing each SNP, we used the covariates 
described earlier, as well as the top five genetic principal components, and a genetic 
kinship matrix based only on SNPs from other chromosomes, to avoid proximal 
contamination57.
The abundance of bacteria present in at least 95% of individuals was encoded 
using the log-abundance; we excluded outlier individuals who were more than five 
standard deviations away from the mean. Otherwise, we dichotomized bacteria 
into presence/absence patterns and encoded the phenotype as a binary vector to 
prevent zero inflation, which leads to a bimodal distribution (LMMs handle binary 
phenotypes properly if the data are not ascertained58).
Comparing results of different studies. We evaluated the consistency of previous 
association studies5,6,8–10 using the number of associations that are in the same 
locus (<100kb apart) and associated with taxa belonging to the same phylum. 
We evaluated replication power by counting the number of SNPs in our own study 
with P<​ 0.05/211 (corresponding to 211 previously reported loci), using the closest 
imputed SNP to the reported one.
Relatives and household-sharing tests. We tested for significant microbiome 
sharing among related individuals or individuals sharing a household, by 
comparing their average Bray–Curtis dissimilarity to that of pairs with no family 
relation or household sharing using a permutation test with 100,000 permutations. 
In each permutation, we randomly divided the combined set of all pairs into two 
disjoint sets while preserving the original set sizes, and asked whether the mean 
difference in Bray–Curtis dissimilarity between individuals in the two sets was 
greater than the difference observed in the real data. To prevent confounding 
effects, we considered only individuals whose stool was collected with a swab (one 
of the two stool collection methods).
Associating environmental factors with the microbiome. We tested for asso￾ciations between 201 environmental factors and microbiome β-diversity at the 
species level with PERMANOVA21, using data from self-reported questionnaires12
(Supplementary Table 17). To quantify the fraction of microbiome variance that 
could be inferred from environmental factors in combination we performed a 
greedy stepwise algorithm, in which at each iteration we added the environmental 
factor that contributed the greatest fraction of inferred variance to factors added 
in previous iterations. Before adding each factor, we permuted it 100 times and 
verified that its contribution was greater than in at least 55% of these permutations. 
If not, we stopped the algorithm. The statistical significance of the resulting 
estimate was evaluated using a permutation testing with 100,000 permutations, 
in which for each permutation we assigned all 201 environmental factors of each 
individual to a random individual, and then reran the entire analysis (including 
the feature selection procedure).
To perform the above procedure with SNPs instead of environmental factors, we 
first selected a set of SNPs in approximate linkage equilibrium that are maximally 
associated with the microbiome β-diversity, and then performed the analysis using 
these SNPs. Specifically, we first sorted the SNPs according to their fraction of 
inferred β-diversity variance, and then iteratively selected 201 top-ranking SNPs 
(corresponding to the number of environmental variants) that are not within 
200kb of a previously selected SNP. We then reran the PERMANOVA analysis 
with the selected SNPs.
Computing polygenic risk scores. PRSs were computed using = ∑ ∈ yˆ x bˆ i j R c i
j j
( ) ,
in which yˆ
i
 is the predicted phenotype, xi
j
 is SNP j of individual i, b
ˆ j
 is the effect of 
SNP j reported in summary statistics and R(c) is the set of SNPs found in both the 
genotyping array and in the summary statistics with P <​ c for the cutoff c. 
The optimal c value was selected by searching over the grid [100
, 3×​ 10−1
, 10−1
, 
…, 10−8
] and finding the value maximizing the Spearman correlation between the 
true and predicted phenotypes. To prevent overfitting, the value of c used to com￾pute the PRS of every individual was estimated using a subset of 90% of the data 
that did not include this individual. Similarly, when performing phenotype 
prediction, we estimated c using only individuals in the training set. SNPs were 
normalized to have a unit variance, according to their reported allele frequency. 
We used the original rather than the imputed set of SNPs, as we empirically verified 
that using the imputed set of SNPs in conjunction with linkage disequilibrium 
pruning did not improve prediction results. The list of summary statistics used is 
provided in Supplementary Table 20.
Construction of a kinship matrix based on microbial genes. We encoded the 
bacterial kinship of individuals i, j using ∑ g g /n k i
k
j
k , in which k iterates over all 
genes present in >1% of individuals, gi
k is the presence/absence indicators of gene 
k in individual i (using a relative abundance cutoff of 10−6
, and normalized to have 
a zero mean and a unit variance), and n is the number of genes (1,360,337).
Microbiome-association index estimation. Microbiome-association index (b2
) 
was estimated using GCTA24, a tool used in statistical genetics for estimating SNP￾based genetic kinship. Instead of a matrix of host SNPs, as is commonly used 
in GCTA, we used a microbial genes-based kinship matrix. For all phenotypes 
(except lactose consumption), the covariates included the PRS of the investigated 
phenotype, the covariates described earlier and the top five genetic principal 
components. In the analysis of lactose consumption, we replaced the PRS with 
the SNPs rs4988235 and rs182549, which largely explain the genetic component 
of lactase persistence in European populations59. P values were computed using 
RL-SKAT60 and confidence intervals were computed using FIESTA25. Outlier 
individuals with phenotypes more than five standard deviations away from the 
mean were excluded from the analysis.
We defined b2
 estimation accuracy for a given covariance matrix using 
the average width of 95% confidence intervals (assuming that b2
 is uniformly 
distributed in [0,1]). We estimated this quantity by invoking FIESTA 100 times 
with 100 different b2
 values evenly spaced in the interval [0,1] and averaging the 
resulting 95% confidence interval widths.
Analysis of data from the Wellcome Trust. We computed confidence intervals 
for genetic heritability estimation using 5,652 previously described26 control 
individuals from the Wellcome Trust National Blood Service and 1958 birth 
cohorts. SNPs with >0.5% missing data, P<​ 0.01 for allele frequency difference 
between the two groups, P<​ 0.000005 for deviation from Hardy–Weinberg equilib￾rium or minor allele frequency <1% were removed. The genetic kinship matrix was 
computed using GCTA24 and confidence intervals were estimated using FIESTA25.
Phenotype prediction. Phenotype prediction was performed with an LMM61, 
using a kinship matrix based on presence/absence of genes, constructed as 
described in ‘Construction of a kinship matrix based on microbial genes’ (LMMs 
are mathematically equivalent to a ridge regression model that uses the principal 
components of the kinship matrix as covariates, and they reduce to linear regres￾sion when not using a kinship matrix). The covariates included age, sex, and daily 
median caloric, carbohydrate, fat and protein consumption. In some experiments 
we additionally included covariates for host genetic effects, represented either as 
PRS (for all phenotypes except lactose consumption) or as the SNPs rs4988235 and 
rs182549 for lactose consumption. Prediction performance was evaluated using 
a tenfold cross validation. Outlier individuals with phenotypes more than five 
standard deviations away from the mean were excluded from all analyses. We also 
evaluated additional types of kinship matrices: (i) a β-diversity matrix, which we 
transformed to a kinship matrix as previously described62; and (ii) kinship matrices 
based on relative abundances or presence/absence of bacterial taxa instead of genes 
(Supplementary Table 23).
Meta-analysis. Meta-analysis of the Israeli and LLD cohorts was performed using 
Stouffer’s method.
Israeli cohort. The Israeli cohort study was approved by Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical 
Center Institutional Review Board, approval numbers TLV-0658-12, TLV-0050-

Life Sciences Reporting Summary
Nature Research wishes to improve the reproducibility of the work that we publish. This form is intended for publication with all accepted life 
science papers and provides structure for consistency and transparency in reporting. Every life science submission will use this form; some list 
items might not apply to an individual manuscript, but all fields must be completed for clarity. 
For further information on the points included in this form, see Reporting Life Sciences Research. For further information on Nature Research 
policies, including our data availability policy, see Authors & Referees and the Editorial Policy Checklist. 
` Experimental design
1. Sample size
Describe how sample size was determined. As this is an observational study based on voluntary participation, we used all the 
samples that were collected throughout the study collection phase. We verified 
that our sample was well powered to answer our research questions using 
extensive power analyses, as described in detail in the Supplementary Information.
2. Data exclusions
Describe any data exclusions. Exclusion criteria consisted of: (i) pregnancy; (ii) usage of antibiotics within three 
months prior to participation; (iii) chronically active inflammatory or neoplastic 
disease in the three years prior to enrollment; (iv) chronic gastrointestinal disorder, 
including Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Celiac disease; (v) skin disease, including 
contact dermatitis, precluding proper attachment of the continuous glucose 
monitor; (vi) active neuropsychiatric disorder; (vii) myocardial infarction or 
cerebrovascular accident in the 6 months prior to participation; (viii) chronic 
immunosuppressive medication usage; (ix) pre-diagnosed type I or type II diabetes 
mellitus.
3. Replication
Describe whether the experimental findings were 
reliably reproduced.
Experimental replication was performed by repeating all analyses on an 
independent cohort, namely the LifeLines-DEEP cohort.
4. Randomization
Describe how samples/organisms/participants were 
allocated into experimental groups.
As this is an observational study, randomization is not relevant and was not 
employed. We controlled for potential sources of confounding by (a) excluding 
participants who are at least third degree relatives with another participants 
(unless stated otherwise for specific analyses); (b) excluding participants self￾reported to share a household with another participant (unless stated otherwise 
for specific analyses); (c) including covariates encoding gender, age, stool collection 
method, self-reported daily median caloric, fat, protein and carbohydrates 
consumption, and the top five principal component of the host genotypes (unless 
stated otherwise for specific analyses); (d) when testing for associations between 
specific SNPs and specific taxa, we used a linear mixed model, which controls for 
confounding due to population structure or subtle genetic relatedness.
5. Blinding
Describe whether the investigators were blinded to 
group allocation during data collection and/or analysis.
As this is an observational study, blinding is not relevant and was not employed.
Note: all studies involving animals and/or human research participants must disclose whether blinding and randomization were used.
