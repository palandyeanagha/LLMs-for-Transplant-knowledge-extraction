ABSTRACT
Background: Multiple renal arteries in kidney grafts have been associated with an increased rate of vascular and urologic complications. Our 
objective is to compare the outcome of transplanted patients who receive a single pedicle kidney with those who receive a multiple arterial 
graft.
Objectives: To find our the differences in the outcome and complications in patients undergoing kidney transplantation with one single 
artery or with multiple arteries.
Patients and Methods: We analyzed 147 kidney transplantations, (all performed in our hospital over a 3 year period). population divided into 
two groups: group A for those who presented with only one renal artery, or group B for those with more than one renal artery. Homogeneous 
vascular reconstructions and implantation rules were applied in all patients. We compared the rates of renal failure between the two 
groups, urinary and vascular complications, patient and graft survivals and the levels of creatinine clearance during the first year of post￾transplantation.
Results: No significant differences were found between the two groups regarding to the values analyzed.
Conclusions: As many other authors, we do believe that the presence of multiple renal arteries in kidney grafts should not be considered as a 
predictive factor of transplantation failure.

Complications in Multiple Arteries Kidney Transplantation Alarcón CM et al.

1. Background
The rate of patients with end-stage renal disease 
is increasing everyday (1). Kidney transplantation is 
the best treatment for most of these patients and 
consequently the number of patients who are wait￾ing for a graft is rising (2). This means that what 
were contraindications in the past are nowadays 
just one more challenge to be overcome (3). Stud￾ies have shown that anatomical anomalies in do￾nor grafts, extraction injuries, receptor diseases or 
donor age should not be reasons for rejecting a re￾nal graft. However, the concept of “marginal graft” 
is growing more flexible every day (4). In Spain, 
living-donor grafts are not standard, so cadaveric 
donors are still the main source for transplanta￾tion. At the time of extraction, we can expect to 
find several anomalies that we could have had prior 
knowledge of, like in living-donor donation, and try 
to avoid them (for example choosing the opposite 
kidney), but in deceased donation grafts should be 
managed to make transplantation possible for the 
largest number of recipients. But do we really be￾lieve those multiple-arteries grafts will have a poor￾er outcome?
2. Objectives
Our goal in this study is to find differences in the 
outcome and complications of patients with only 
one artery or with multiple arteries that led us to 
think in worst, better or equal results in kidney 
transplantation.
3. Patients and Methods
Between January 2006 and December 2008 147 
cadaveric-donor kidney transplantations were per￾formed in university hospital Virgen de la Arrixaca 
by the authors of this paper. We evaluated all of 
cases, including those grafts that were rejected for 
some reason at the time of the implantation (for in￾stance, vascular complications). After cadaveric ex￾traction (most of which were multiorganic) bench 
surgery was carried out and implantation of the 
graft performed, preferably in the right iliac fos￾sa, with end-to-side anastomosis of the graft main 
vessels to the external iliac artery and vein avoid￾ing atheromatous plaques. Both anastomoses were 
performed with two halves of running non-absorb￾able monofil 6x0 or 5x0 sutures. Extravesical ure￾teroneocystostomy (Lich-Gregoir technique) with 
double-J stent was used for urinary reconstruction. 
All patients received the standard triple drug im￾munossuppression.
Mean patient age was 50.9 ± 12.24 years (range 18-75 
years) and 46.66 ± 16.42 years (range 14-75 years) for 
the donors; 96 (65.3%) were males and 51 (34.7%) fe￾males. Thirty-three grafts (22.4%) had multiple arter￾ies (group B) and the rest, 114 (77.6%), had one single 
artery (Group A). Regarding bench reconstructions, 
when there were polar arteries of less than 2 mm in 
diameter they were ligated (4 patients). If the dis￾tance between the two main arteries (more than 2 
mm in diameter) was less than 2 cm, a common aor￾tic patch had been used (in 21 patients). However, if 
it was greater than 2 cm, we carried out side-to-side 
(pantaloon) anastomosis (4 patients) when the cali￾ber was of equal size or sequential anastomosis in 
recipient (5 patients) when the calibers were very 
different. Only two grafts had three arteries, one of 
them was ligated because of its small caliber, and 
bench surgery was performed as in double artery 
grafts. One graft had 4 arteries, so one polar artery 
was ligated, two were converted to a single arterial 
vessel after bench reconstruction and 2 end-to-side 
anastomosis were performed in the external iliac 
artery. This patient suffered extensive external iliac 
vein thrombosis when we removed the vessel clamp 
and transplantectomy was performed.
To evaluate the outcome of transplantation we re￾corded the following factors in the first year after 
surgery: (a) patient and (b) graft survival; (c) the 
incidence of vascular complications (renal artery 
and vein thrombosis and renal artery stenosis); (c) 
urinary complications (ureteral stenosis and leak); 
(d) delayed graft function (DGF), that was defined 
as when serum creatinine levels increased or re￾mained unchanged after 5 five days post-transplan￾tation, and the levels of creatinine clearance at one, 
two, three, six, nine and twelve months.
The differences between the groups of patients 
(A and B) were analyzed using SPSS 10 software: t￾student test for the means of levels of creatinine 
clearance, Chi-Square test for the complications 
rates and Kaplan-Meier plots for the graft and pa￾tient survival.
4. Results
4.1. Graft and Patient Survival
The one year graft survival rate was 87.5%; 15 pa￾tients lost the graft function (due to surgical causes 
such as vascular complications with immediate 
transplantectomy or medical causes such as rejec￾tion). Patient survival was 95.5%; six patients died in 
this period. No statistically significant differences 
were found between groups A and B ( Table 1 ).

4.2. Delayed Graft Function
The incidence of DGF in the 147 patients was 25.9%; 
27% in the group A and 21% in the group B and was 
not significantly different.
4.3. Vascular Complications
We only found one case (0.7%) of renal artery 
thrombosis, one case (0.7%) of renal vein throm￾bosis and three cases (2%) of renal artery stenosis. 
The case of artery thrombosis occurred in the pa￾tient who was transplanted using the graft with 
four arteries. Transplantectomy was performed in 
both cases of vascular thrombosis and the cases of 
stenosis were successfully treated by balloon angio￾plasty. No statistically significant differences were 
found between groups A and B.
4.4. Urologic Complications
Eight cases (5.4%) of ureteral obstruction that were 
treated by balloon ureteroplasty, with only one case 
of restenosis that required surgery (reimplanta￾tion of the ureter into the bladder) had been found. 
Fourteen patients (9.5%) suffered anastomotic or 
bladder leakage and urgent reimplantation was 
performed on all of them. There were no statisti￾cally significant differences between both groups.
4.5. Creatinine Clearance
No significant differences between groups A and B 
were found with respect to creatinine clearance at 
1, 2, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. It could be concluded that 
in the first year renal function was similar in pa￾tients with a single-artery graft compared to those 
with a multiple-artery graft ( Table 2 ).

5. Discussion
Throughout the cadaveric extraction the surgeon 
could find anatomic anomalies that are not uncom￾mon. In fact, Harrison et al. revised arteriographies 
of future living-donors and concluded that 25% of 
people had multiples arteries and less than 50% of 
them had the simplest form of renal vascular pedi￾cle (5). Other authors reported vascular anomalies 
rates of 28% (6). Prior the nineties, several studies 
reported a higher rate of complications and acute 
tubular necrosis when multiple artery grafts were

used (7-9). Consequently, it was customary for sur￾geons to reject grafts found with two or three arter￾ies during extraction because they were problem￾atic to manage in the operating room and after the 
operation.
Fortunately, after those discouraging studies, due 
to the long hospital waiting list for deceased donor 
grafts and the peak in the number of living donors, 
a larger series of patients were analyzed with very 
different statistical results. Authors of these stud￾ies did not find differences in the outcomes when 
comparing the patients who received a multiple ar￾tery graft with those who received a single pedicle 
kidney (1, 10-16). Some authors even concluded that 
every anomaly or injury in the extraction had to be 
overcome in bench surgery (4). Vascular reconstruc￾tion techniques were better defined and they some￾times varied considerably between surgical teams, 
but it became conceivable to contrast the results of 
each technique and to draw conclusions about how 
to improve vascular reconstructions.
As a matter of fact, we cannot deny that the exis￾tence of anatomic anomalies in renal grafts is an 
added difficulty. They need to be dealt with by an 
experienced team in vascular reconstruction and 
involve a higher cold and warm ischemic time that 
can be improved by using the common aortic patch 
(Carrel patch). Unfortunately, this technique is not 
possible in living donation. However this increase 
in ischemic time is not enough to damage the graft 
if it is adequately perfused and cooled (16).
One limitation of our study could be the moni￾toring duration (one year). We do believe that the 
classic complications associated with vascular 
anomalies in kidney transplantation (acute tubu￾lar necrosis, urinary obstructions or leaks, vascular 
thrombosis) are usually occur early; only arterial 
stenosis tends to happen later and is usually diag￾nosed between 6 months and 3 years post-trans￾plantation (11). The management of the urinary and 
the arterial stenosis should be primarily percutane￾ous, which leads to good results and low morbidity 
(12). One important aspect of our study is that all 
the surgeons who performed the transplantation 
used the same vascular reconstruction techniques 
and they all used the external iliac vessels, which 
means we can consider our methods to be more ho￾mogeneous than other prior studies.
Like many other authors we cannot conclude that 
the use of multiple artery grafts is associated with a 
poorer outcome. Consequently, it is currently unac￾ceptable to reject organs because of this anomaly 
and as a result more patients can benefit from the 
best treatment for the end-stage kidney disease. 
More studies are necessary in order to shed the 
light on the subject.
