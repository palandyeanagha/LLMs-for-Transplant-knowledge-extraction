Abstract
Background: Mobile health (mHealth) is currently among the supporting elements that may contribute to an improvement in
health markers by helping people adopt healthier lifestyles. mHealth interventions have been widely reported to achieve greater
weight loss than other approaches, but their effect on body composition remains unclear.
Objective: This study aimed to assess the short-term (3 months) effectiveness of a mobile app and a smart band for losing
weight and changing body composition in sedentary Spanish adults who are overweight or obese.
Methods: A randomized controlled, multicenter clinical trial was conducted involving the participation of 440 subjects from
primary care centers, with 231 subjects in the intervention group (IG; counselling with smartphone app and smart band) and 209
in the control group (CG; counselling only). Both groups were counselled about healthy diet and physical activity. For the 3-month
intervention period, the IG was trained to use a smartphone app that involved self-monitoring and tailored feedback, as well as
a smart band that recorded daily physical activity (Mi Band 2, Xiaomi). Body composition was measured using the InBody 230
bioimpedance device (InBody Co., Ltd), and physical activity was measured using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire.

Results: The mHealth intervention produced a greater loss of body weight (–1.97 kg, 95% CI –2.39 to –1.54) relative to standard
counselling at 3 months (–1.13 kg, 95% CI –1.56 to –0.69). Comparing groups, the IG achieved a weight loss of 0.84 kg more
than the CG at 3 months. The IG showed a decrease in body fat mass (BFM; –1.84 kg, 95% CI –2.48 to –1.20), percentage of
body fat (PBF; –1.22%, 95% CI –1.82% to 0.62%), and BMI (–0.77 kg/m2
, 95% CI –0.96 to 0.57). No significant changes were
observed in any of these parameters in men; among women, there was a significant decrease in BMI in the IG compared with the
CG. When subjects were grouped according to baseline BMI, the overweight group experienced a change in BFM of –1.18 kg
(95% CI –2.30 to –0.06) and BMI of –0.47 kg/m2
(95% CI –0.80 to –0.13), whereas the obese group only experienced a change
in BMI of –0.53 kg/m2
(95% CI –0.86 to –0.19). When the data were analyzed according to physical activity, the moderate-vigorous
physical activity group showed significant changes in BFM of –1.03 kg (95% CI –1.74 to –0.33), PBF of –0.76% (95% CI –1.32%
to –0.20%), and BMI of –0.5 kg/m2
(95% CI –0.83 to –0.19).
Conclusions: The results from this multicenter, randomized controlled clinical trial study show that compared with standard
counselling alone, adding a self-reported app and a smart band obtained beneficial results in terms of weight loss and a reduction
in BFM and PBF in female subjects with a BMI less than 30 kg/m2
and a moderate-vigorous physical activity level. Nevertheless,
further studies are needed to ensure that this profile benefits more than others from this intervention and to investigate modifications
of this intervention to achieve a global effect.

Introduction
Obesity and overweight are considered a major public health
issue. The prevalence of obesity has reached epidemic levels,
with 650 million adults worldwide estimated to be obese in
2016 [1]. Additionally, more than one-half of the population in
Europe is classified as overweight or obese [2]. In the case of
Spain, the proportion of obese people may reach 58% by 2030
[3]. The association of obesity with cardiovascular diseases and
type 2 diabetes [4], among other diseases, is well known, and
obesity also exacerbates cardiovascular risk factors [5]. Thus,
it contributes to an increase in the mortality rate worldwide, as
a more frequent cause than underweight or malnutrition [6].
This situation makes the development and implementation of
weight management interventions imperative.
Because of the complex nature of obesity, a multifactorial
strategy is needed. The modification of lifestyles is the
cornerstone of weight management, including diverse aspects,
such as reduced energy intake, increased energy expenditure,
exercise, and behavior change strategies [7,8]. Primary care
providers (PCPs) play a critical role in recommending
appropriate weight-loss strategies. Moreover, the positive effect
of PCP advice on patient engagement in weight loss efforts has
been demonstrated [9]. Unfortunately, there are some barriers
to obesity management, such as the lack of tools or training
[10]. Also, interventions are usually individual and face-to-face,
which generates more demands by the patient, thereby increasing
the burden on health care professionals and the health care
system.
Mobile health (mHealth) could be an excellent strategy for PCPs
to implement with their patients to help them maintain lifestyle
changes. Information and communication technologies (ICTs)
have the potential to standardize and improve the quality of
treatment provided and increase resources for prevention
activities [11]. They also allow PCPs to address barriers through
enhancing self-monitoring of the patient by registering progress
or symptoms, which could improve feedback communication
and enable PCPs to spend less time gathering routine data and
more time engaging with patients. This means of interaction
might enhance treatment outcomes as well as improve follow-up
of some chronic diseases [12] while optimizing PCP time and
reducing costs [13]. Every year, thousands of mobile apps are
developed with the purpose of improving lifestyles. To ensure
that these tools are able to have a positive influence, more
studies are needed because most apps available are suboptimal
in quality, meaning that they have inadequate scientific coverage
and accuracy of weight-related information [14]. Compared
with usual practice, the use of ICTs in the primary care context
might help patients to achieve significant weight loss [15],
including patients who are socioeconomically disadvantaged
[16], thereby increasing egalitarian access to treatment.
However, further research is needed to determine the optimal
use of technology in weight loss, since the inclusion of small
sample sizes, and the variability in study designs, follow-up
times, and interventions, may hinder replication and comparison
of results [17], leading to unclear conclusions in this regard.
In relation to weight loss interventions on body composition,
some studies have reported the effect of an energy-restricted
high-protein diet combined with exercise on decreasing fat-free
mass [18] and leisure-time exercise in reducing fat mass [19].
In recent years, some studies have provided important findings
related to the feasibility of ICT interventions in this practical
setting, such as the LEAN study [20] and the IDEA study [21].
In addition, a recent pilot study assessing a telenutrition weight
loss intervention in primary care showed greater loss of weight
and body fat in obese men compared with usual care [22]. These
results spotlight the need for more research in this field in order

to achieve the optimal combination of health tools and the time
needed to achieve changes.
However, previous studies have usually considered weight and
BMI as the main outcomes. Although BMI is easy to obtain, it
is an indirect measure of body composition and, therefore, less
accurate than other measures [23] in estimating the distribution
of body fat, resulting in misclassification of obesity. Recent
studies have highlighted other useful measures involved in
weight regulation, such as fat-free mass (FFM), body fat mass
(BFM), and percentage of body fat (PBF), which could better
explain body composition changes during weight interventions
[24]. These variables are analyzed by bioelectrical impedance
analysis (BIA), an indirect measure that uses multiple electrical
currents through the body to estimate the percentage of different
types of body tissue. Regarding the PBF, the correlation between
BIA and the reference measure—dual-energy X-ray
absorptiometry—was 0.88 for a healthy population [25], with
a mean difference of –1.83 (SD 4.1%) for all subjects. In
addition, BIA is the most cost-effective method of measuring
body composition [26], making it a good alternative for its
estimation.
Furthermore, it is important to determine whether these
technologies can increase weight loss and modify body
composition to clinically significant levels, which would show
that ICTs could potentially be useful in tackling obesity. This
study aims to assess the short-term effectiveness of a 3-month
intervention that includes a smartphone app in combination with
a smart band to lose weight and change body composition in
sedentary Spanish adults who are overweight or obese.
Methods
Design and Scope
EVIDENT 3 is a randomized controlled, multicenter clinical
trial with two parallel groups with a follow-up period of 12
months. The study was conducted in a primary care setting. The
Primary Care Research Unit in Salamanca (APISAL) at the
Biomedical Research Institute of Salamanca (IBSAL)
coordinated the project in five primary care centers belonging
to the Network for Preventive Activity and Health Promotion
(REDIAPP) (Salamanca, Valladolid, Cuenca, Palma de
Mallorca, and Zaragoza). Between June 2017 and November
2019, evaluations were made at baseline and at the 3-month
follow-up visit. The results presented in this paper correspond
to the short-term effect (3 months) of the intervention on body
composition, considered one of the EVIDENT 3 study’s
secondary outcomes.
Study Population
The participants were selected by random sampling among the
patients attending a consultation with their family doctor in each
participating center. The inclusion criteria were age between
20 and 65 years, a BMI between 27.5 kg/m2
and 40 kg/m2
,
agreement to participate in the study, and signing the informed
consent document. A detailed description of inclusion and
exclusion criteria has been published in the study protocol [27].
To determine the effect of the intervention on body composition,
an additional criterion was set: only subjects with both body
composition measurements (at baseline and 3-month visit)
assessed using the InBody 230 Body Composition Analyzer
(InBody Co., Ltd) were included in the analysis. Hence, the
study sample consisted of 440 subjects.
Sample Size
The sample size calculation was performed for the primary
study endpoint of weight loss. Accepting an α risk of 0.05 and
a β risk of 0.20, with an SD of 12 kg, and estimating from
subjects from the EVIDENT 2 study [28], it was determined
that 592 subjects would be needed (296 per group) to detect a
decrease in weight of 3 kg or more [29] in the intervention group
(IG) versus the control group (CG), taking into consideration a
15% loss of subjects at follow-up. This effect size represented
a 3% to 5% difference between the groups, which was expected
to produce clinically relevant health benefits [30]. There were
440 participants who completed the 3-month visit (IG, n=231;
CG, n=209). Taking into account the sample size and a common
SD of weight difference of 3.27 kg, the poststudy power to
detect the 0.839 kg weight loss difference found between groups
as significant was 77%.
Randomization
Participants were randomly assigned into two groups in a 1:1
ratio for the control group (CG) and intervention group (IG).
Randomization was done after informed consent was obtained.
The allocation sequence was generated through a standardized
computer program (Epidat 4.2) by an independent researcher
and concealed until the trial group was assigned (Figure 1). To
minimize contamination between groups, the investigator who
performed the intervention was different from the investigator
who conducted the evaluation. The investigator who performed
the data analysis was blinded to the subjects’ groups. Due to
the nature of the study, the subjects could not be blinded to the
intervention.

Procedures
Each participant had to complete an initial visit and two
follow-up visits, at 3 months and 12 months, after study
inclusion. Baseline and follow-up data were collected by a
research nurse. The IG completed an additional set of
measurements at an appointment 7 days after baseline, with a
different nurse performing the measurements, where the
application was explained and the smart band given.
Outcome Measurements
The primary outcome was weight loss. Secondary outcomes
included changes in some parameters of body composition. All
outcomes were measured at baseline and 3 months after
randomization.
Weight Loss
Body weight was measured to the nearest 0.1 kg, with the
subject barefoot, wearing light clothing, and removing heavy

pocket items, using the portable InBody 230 Body Composition
Analyzer (InBody Co., Ltd). Height was measured with the
subject barefoot in a standing position using a portable scale
and measurement system (Seca 222), and the average of 2
readings rounded to the nearest centimeter was recorded. BMI
was calculated by dividing weight (in kg) by height squared (in
m
2
). Following the recommendations of the Spanish Society
for the Study of Obesity (SEEDO) [31], waist circumference
was measured in duplicate, using a flexible tape parallel to the
floor, at the level of the midpoint between the last rib and the
iliac crest, with the subject standing without clothing, after
inspiration. Hip circumference was similarly measured at the
level of the trochanters.
Body Composition
Body composition was determined by multifrequency BIA using
an InBody 230 analyzer, with tetra-polar 8-point tactile
electrodes that estimate total body water (TBW), dry lean mass,
BFM, skeletal muscle mass (SMM), PBF, distribution of lean
body mass, ratio of segmental lean mass, basal metabolic rate
(BMR), and impedance of each body segment. This validated
device [32] uses multiple currents at varying frequencies to
provide precise body composition analysis without empirical
estimation, increasing the reliability of the results.
The measurement was taken in the morning, before noon, with
the subject barefoot, wearing light clothing, and standing upright
for approximately 5 minutes before testing, with at least 2 hours
of fasting and an empty bladder. These recommendations aim
to measure body composition to the highest accuracy possible.
The standing patient was required to wipe the palms of the
hands, thumbs, and soles of the feet with the InBody tissue
before placing them in the electrodes properly before testing.
Individuals with medical implant devices such as pacemakers,
essential support devices, or orthopedic prostheses, as well as
pregnant women, could not be tested.
Clinically Relevant Measures
Data on the sociodemographic characteristics of the population
including age, sex, education level, occupation, smoking history,
and personal history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes
mellitus, as well as any active medical treatment, were collected.
Smoking history was assessed through questions about the
participant’s smoking status (smoker or nonsmoker). We
considered smokers to be subjects who currently smoked or
who had stopped smoking less than 1 year before.
The short version of the International Physical Activity
Questionnaire (IPAQ) [33] was used to measure activity
subjectively. The IPAQ is a self-reported questionnaire that
assesses physical activity performed at three intensity levels
according to the energy expenditure estimated for each level:
walking, moderate intensity, and vigorous intensity. For each
level, participants reported frequencies such as days per week
and average duration in minutes over the past week. This
allowed the metabolic equivalents (METs) per minute per week
to be calculated and subjects to be classified according to three
activity levels: light, moderate, and vigorous.
Other variables were measured, including drug use, blood
pressure, postprandial glucose, and biochemical parameters
(total serum cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol,
and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol). A detailed description
of how these variables were measured was published in the
study protocol [27].
Intervention
Standard Counselling (CG and IG)
Both groups (CG and IG) received 5 minutes of counselling at
the end of the baseline visit and prior to randomization. A
trained nurse at each primary health center, who was not
involved in other aspects of the study, gave advice on physical
activity and healthy diet according to the current international
recommendations for the general population. The health benefits
of physical activity and the recommendation to complete at least
30 minutes of moderate activity 5 days a week, or 20 minutes
of vigorous activity 3 days a week, were explained. Counselling
on food was in compliance with the plate method [34].
Specific Intervention (IG)
The IG received the smartphone app and a smart band (Mi Band
2, Xiaomi) for 3 months, corresponding to the length of the
intervention. Once the baseline visit was completed, another
15-minute visit was carried out 7 days later, at which the
subjects were trained to use the device and the app (EVIDENT
3 Application [record entry no.00/2017/2438]), which was
specifically designed for the study by CGB Computer Company
and APISAL.
During the 15-minute visit, the app was configured with each
participant’s data (sex, age, weight, and height). It was designed
to allow the dietary intake to be self-reported daily (Figure 2)
and automatically record physical activity data from the smart
band. Variables collected from the wearable device were number
of steps taken, time of activity, kilometers traveled, and
kilocalories expended. Subjects entered their food intake daily
(divided into breakfast, midmorning snack, lunch, afternoon
snack, and dinner) by selecting dishes and foods from the app
menu and indicating the portion size. Thus, data collected
comprised average energy intake (kcals), macronutrients and
micronutrients (g/day), and time spent using the app (days).
Food composition data were collected from the Spanish Food
Composition Database [35] developed by RedBEDCA and
AESAN. Once all of the daily information was collected, the
app integrated the data to create personalized recommendations,
based on the subjects’ characteristics, and specific objectives
and goals for weight loss. The subject was able to consult the
app for these recommendations, as well as information about
caloric intake changes and macronutrient distribution. At the
3-month visit, the devices were collected. All information
generated by the app was duly analyzed and entered into the
database.

Figure 2. EVIDENT app feedback information.
The behavioral strategies used in the intervention were those
that enhance behavior changes toward healthier lifestyles. In
this case, activities were meant to enhance self-efficacy, which
is one of the most important determinants of behavior change
[36,37], through self-monitoring, goal setting, and positive
reinforcement. In order to avoid scheduling issues due to work
shifts or other daily duties, participants were advised to use the
app at the end of the day to register daily meals as well as to
check physical activity information on the app. The smart band,
worn at every moment, was set to congratulate the user when
reaching 10,000 steps, following the general steps per day
recommendation [38].
Blinding Strategy
The investigator carrying out the intervention with the IG was
different from the person responsible for the assessment and
standard counselling; both were kept blinded throughout the
study, as was the investigator conducting data analysis. Due to
the nature of the study, the subjects could not be blinded. To
prevent contamination between groups, in the assessment visits
(at 3 and 12 months), only the study variables were evaluated,
but no advice or reinforcement could be given. In addition, the
app was not available for download on the internet until the end
of the study, so the CG could not make use of it in any way.
During the follow-up visits, participants were instructed not to
use other digital health technologies.
Ethical Considerations
The study was approved by the Clinical Research Ethics
Committee of the Health Area of Salamanca on April 2016. All
procedures were performed in accordance with the ethical
standards of the institutional research committee and with the
2013 Declaration of Helsinki. All patients signed written
informed consent documents prior to participation in the study.
The trial was registered at ClinicalTrial.gov with identifier
NCT03175614.
Statistical Analysis
General Analysis
The results were expressed as mean (SD) for quantitative
variables and as frequency distributions for qualitative variables.
The statistical normality was tested using the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Chi-square and Fisher tests were
used to analyze the association between independent qualitative
variables. Student t and Mann-Whitney U tests were used for
the comparison of means between 2 independent groups. Pearson
correlation and Spearman rho were used to evaluate the
relationship between quantitative variables.
Analysis of Intervention Effect on Primary and
Secondary Outcomes
To analyze the changes at 3 months after baseline in primary
(weight loss) and secondary endpoints within the same group,
we used the paired t test or McNemar test for quantitative or
dichotomous variables, respectively. To analyze the effect of
the intervention, we performed a multivariate analysis of
variance of repeated measures, adjusted by the baseline value
of each variable, in the follow-up for primary and secondary
endpoints.
Analysis by Subgroups
We carried out subanalyses of the intervention effect on primary
and secondary outcomes by sex (men and women), BMI at
baseline (<30 kg/m2
and ≥30 kg/m2
), and initial self-reported
physical activity level (light and moderate-vigorous physical
activity). Subanalyses were sufficiently powered (>65%) to
detect differences in women, moderate-vigorous physical

physical activity.
The contrast in hypotheses established an α of .05. The data
were analyzed using SPSS Statistics software (version 25.0;
IBM Corp).
Results
Baseline Characteristics of the Participants and
Follow-up
A total of 650 subjects fulfilled all of the inclusion criteria. They
were included into the program and randomized to the IG or
CG. Participant flow is presented in Figure 1. Testing at the
3-month visit was completed by 563 of 650 participants (86.6%).
In addition to the 87 subjects (13.4%) who dropped out during
the study (Figure 1), 123 (123/650, 18.9%) subjects were
excluded from the analysis. Exclusion requirements to perform
the test were met in 86 subjects (86/650, 13.2%), so there were
no measurements at any visit. In addition, the measurements of
37 subjects were not included due to incorrectly performed tests
(25/650, 3.8%) or misrecorded data (12/650, 1.8%). Thus, 440
subjects (IG: n= 231; CG: n= 209) were included in the final
analysis.
Both groups had a similar mean age—47.4 (SD 10.0) years in
the IG and 48.8 (SD 9.2) years in the CG—and most participants
were women (IG: 161/231, 69.7%; CG: 144/209, 68.9%) (Table
1). Most participants had middle or high school education or
higher (206/231, 89.2% and 181/209, 86.6%) and a mean
baseline BMI of 32.8 (SD 3.3) and 32.9 (SD 3.4) in the IG and
CG, respectively. No differences in baseline characteristics were
observed between the IG and CG.
Adherence to the smartphone app in the IG was calculated from
app output data, showing that 129 of 231 (55.8%) subjects
adhered sufficiently by using it for 60 days or more, 41 of 231
(17.8%) subjects used the app for 31 to 60 days, and 43 of 231
(18.6%) subjects entered data on 30 days or less. Two subjects
(2/231, 0.9%) did not register any food intake information, and
there were 16 corrupted files (16/231, 6.9%) from which no
information was obtainable (Figure 3).
Regarding body composition variables, which were evaluated
using BIA, no differences were found between the groups, with
a mean weight of 89.7 kg (SD 13.1) in the IG and 90.7 kg (SD
13.9) in the CG. PBF, estimated using the InBody device, was
41.8% (SD 7.6%) and 42.1% (SD 6.4%) in the IG and CG,
respectively. The main variables related to body composition
are shown in Table 2.
In terms of self-reported physical activity, the IG had a total of
1263.6 METs/min/week and the CG had a total of 1353.3
METs/min/week, measured using the 7-day IPAQ, with no
difference between them. At baseline, most of the sample
showed a moderate physical activity level, in both the IG
(50.2%) and the CG (51.2%).

Changes in Body Weight During Study Period
The IG showed large changes in body weight (–1.97 kg, 95%
CI –2.39 to –1.54) between baseline and 3 months, while the
change was smaller (–1.13 kg, 95% CI –1.56 to –0.69) in the
CG. Comparing groups, the IG achieved a weight loss of 0.84
kg more than the CG at 3 months (Table 3).

Changes in Body Composition After Intervention
The IG showed a decrease in body composition variables (Figure
4), with a change of –1.84 kg (95% CI –2.48 to –1.20) in BFM,
–1.22% (95% CI –0.96% to –0.57%) in PBF, and 0.77 kg/m2
(95% CI –0.96 to –0.57) in BMI. A significant between-group
difference was noted only in BMI (–0.54 kg/m2
, 95% CI –0.84
to –0.24).
Figure 4. Evolution over time of main body composition variables. (A) Weight. (B) BMI. (C) Body fat mass. (D) Percentage of body fat.
Analyzing by sex, men who received the intervention reduced
BFM (–1.80 kg, 95% CI –2.77 to –0.83), PBF (–1.48%, 95%
CI –2.39% to –0.57%), and BMI (–0.58 kg/m2
, 95% CI –0.87
to –0.29). Women and men in the IG achieved similar results,
decreasing BFM (–1.86 kg, 95% CI –2.68 to –1.04), PBF
(–0.89%, 95% CI –1.13% to –0.66%), and BMI (–0.89 kg/m2
,
95% CI –1.13 to –0.66). Although no significant changes were
observed in any of these parameters in men, BMI was
significantly reduced in women in the IG compared with women
in the CG.
Changes in Weight and Body Composition by Baseline
BMI Classification
Regarding BMI groups at baseline (Table 4), weight loss in the
IG was greater in subjects with type I obesity (BMI≥30 kg/m2
)
than in overweight (BMI<30 kg/m2
) subjects, with significant
results in both cases, although compared with the CG, the
differences were higher in the overweight group (–1.10 kg, 95%
CI –2.01 to –0.18) than in the group with type I obesity (–0.77
kg, 95% CI –1.52 to –0.01).

In terms of body composition variables, both the CG and the
IG showed reductions in BFM, PBF, and waist-to-hip ratio
(WHR), with the reductions being greater in the IG. Comparing
these groups, the biggest reductions were seen in the overweight
group, with reductions in BFM (–1.18 kg, 95% CI –2.30 to
–0.06) and BMI (–0.47 kg/m2
, 95% CI –0.80 to –0.13), whereas
the group with type I obesity only decreased BMI (–0.53 kg/m2
,
95% CI –0.86 to –0.19). We observed no significant
between-group differences in other study variables.
Changes in Weight and Body Composition by Baseline
Self-Reported Physical Activity
When the data were analyzed according to the baseline physical
activity level measured using the IPAQ (Table 5), there was a
decrease in body composition variables in both the light physical
activity and the moderate-vigorous physical activity groups
within the IG. Participants in the light physical activity group
lost similar weight (–1.99 kg, 95% CI –2.74 to –1.24) as those
in the moderate-vigorous physical activity group (–1.95 kg,

95% CI –2.46 to –1.43). However, only the moderate-vigorous
physical activity group achieved a significant net loss compared
with the CG (–1.03 kg, 95% CI –1.76 to –0.29).
In addition, the IG decreased body composition variables,
showing reductions in the moderate-vigorous physical activity
group such as –1.89 kg (95% CI –2.36 to –1.42) in BFM,
–1.34% (95% CI –1.70% to –0.97%) in PBF, and –0.76 kg/m2
(95% CI –0.95 to –0.57) in BMI, whereas the light physical
activity group showed reductions of –1.77 kg (95% CI –3.21
to –0.33) in BFM and –0.85 kg/m2
(95% CI –1.21 to –0.49) in
BMI. Comparing these results with their counterparts in the
CG, we found that only BMI (–0.51 kg/m2
, 95% CI –0.97 to
–0.06) showed a significant difference in the light physical
activity group, while the moderate-vigorous physical activity
group reduced BFM (–1.03 kg, 95% CI –1.74 to –0.33), PBF
(–0.76%, 95% CI –1.32% to –0.20%), and BMI (–0.51 kg/m2
,
95% CI –0.83 to –0.19) significantly. Differences in other body
composition variables were not found.

Discussion
Principal Findings
This study showed that the combined use of a mobile app and
a smart band for 3 months, plus brief counselling at the start of
the intervention, achieved a slight decrease in weight and BMI
but not in other body composition variables. However,
subanalyses by BMI, self-reported physical activity, and sex
showed a greater decrease in variables such as BMI, WHR,
BFM, and PBF in the IG with counselling than in the CG with
counselling alone. Adding mHealth as a way of coaching and
promoting healthy lifestyles in obese individuals may enhance
weight loss outcomes at 3 months. More specifically, the
intervention might be more effective in overweight women with

moderate physical activity, given that this group experienced
greater reductions in weight and body composition variables.
This study offers relevant insight into the effect of mobile apps
combined with wearable devices, such as an activity-tracking
bracelet, on changing body composition with a large sample
size. In recent years, interest in the effects of mHealth on body
composition using BIA has increased, giving rise to research
such as the TALENT study [39], in which an intensive,
web-based lifestyle intervention (Individual Health
Management) showed promising results, achieving a mean loss
of approximately 10% of the baseline weight and a reduction
in BMI, BFM, PBF, and waist circumference at 12 months.
Even though the exercise intervention was on a web-based
program, and no wearable devices were used, the results are in
line with the results of this study. However, the IDEA study
[21], in which one of the study groups was provided with
wearable technology with a web-based interface for 24 months,
did not find differences in body composition. Moreover, the
study sample comprised only young adults, and it is not possible
to generalize these results to other populations.
Taking studies with mobile apps into account, these results
agree with other similar studies assessing the short-term effect
of the Noom app (Noom Inc), a commercialized app that
provides lifestyle-related logs, mainly food intake and exercise.
The Noom app has been studied in combination with human
coaching for 8 weeks [40] and alone for 15 and 52 weeks [41],
achieving statistically significant decreases in weight, BMI,
waist circumference, BFM, and PBF in both sexes. Nonetheless,
none of these studies included a proper control group, requiring
further research with high-quality methodology, which was the
purpose of this study.
In terms of physical activity, a recent meta-analysis [42]
demonstrated that a wearable technology intervention duration
of more than 12 weeks was significantly more efficient than an
intervention of fewer than 12 weeks in terms of BMI outcomes,
and a systematic review [43] suggested that an activity tracker
combined with a weight loss program may provide superior
short-term (less than 6 months) results in middle-aged or older
adults. Similarly, an intervention with Fitbit wrist activity tracker
(Fitbit Inc) in medical students showed a positive trend for PBF
in overweight women and lean body mass in overweight men
[44], and another study using an app with push notifications to
enhance diet and physical activity showed greater weight loss
and body fat loss in obese women [45]. These results are in line
with the results of this study, where there was a trend in BFM
and PBF to decrease more in the IG, although no significant
reduction was observed. In these studies, as in our research, a
larger effect on fat mass was observed in women, which may
be explained by the influence of psychological determinants,
as women are more interested in participating in nutritional
interventions [46] because of a desire to lose weight [47]. Also,
we obtained a lower participation rate in men than in women,
following the trend of the majority of studies of weight
management [48], which could have led to body fat differences
not being found in the male group in this study. Furthermore,
body composition varies depending on sex, as women usually
have a larger body fat mass proportion, whereas men are more
likely to show greater lean mass, making a larger decrease of
fat tissue in interventions with women plausible. Additionally,
Slentz et al [49] reported that low amount/moderate-intensity
and low-amount/vigorous-intensity endurance training (activity
equivalent to 12 miles per week of walking or jogging) were
equally effective in reducing the PBF, BFM, and waist
circumference in sedentary adults. This result is in line with our
findings and may explain part of the improvement in body
composition variables in women through increased physical
exercise.
The current results show the potential benefit of a short-term
mHealth intervention with a mobile app, a smart band, and brief
counselling as a useful tool for modifying body composition in
overweight and obese healthy people in a primary health context.
These findings are clinically relevant for various reasons. First,
being an mHealth intervention with no professional face-to-face
sessions or follow-up implies that there might be a cost reduction
to implementing it in public health programs, and thus, this
could be more cost-effective than other approaches. Through
this study, we have identified the potential target profile for this
intervention: overweight women (aged 18 to 65 years) with
moderate physical activity at baseline. However, the physical
activity classification was made using the IPAQ, which implies
some degree of subjectivity and inaccuracy due to self-reporting.
Future studies should explore the classification by accelerometer
or another objective source of baseline physical activity in an
attempt to obtain similar results. Nevertheless, these findings
could be useful for adapting the intervention to population
groups, whereby characteristics of each group could be taken
into account in increasing the usefulness of the mHealth
intervention.
Second, weight and/or BMI cannot solely be used as an accurate
indicator of health, since body composition information is also
relevant. The analysis of body composition could shed light on
this field, allowing us to differentiate between the metabolically
healthy but overweight and those with normal weight but with
a pathological state. These states can be related to body
components (eg, leg fat or SMM), endocrine interactions
between individual fat deposits and muscle mass, and/or
inflammation [50]. This stratification may be necessary to
optimize prevention and treatment strategies and could be
measured directly through bioimpedance variables. Furthermore,
it is well known that excess body fat and its distribution are
associated with metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance [51].
For these reasons, interventions that can modify body
composition, focusing on decreasing BFM and PBF and leading
to improved health markers, should be a priority in national
health policies. In this sense, it is important to implement other
measures related to fat distribution in addition to weight or BMI
in daily clinical practice for a better approach. Even though our
study showed moderate reductions in weight, BFM, and PBF
in the IG, current findings support that a reduction in
whole-body fat mass could predict changes in cardiometabolic
health indices when increasing physical activity [52], even when
body weight remains stable. In addition, physical activity seems
to have a cardioprotective effect in subjects with higher PBF
[53]. Thus, implementing this intervention in daily clinical
practice could reduce the cardiovascular risk in overweight and
obese people and its associated long-term issues.

Finally, it is important to point out the main limitations of this
study. Missing InBody data were greater than expected (123
subjects). The majority of data lost were due to participants not
meeting requirements to carry out the measurement, mainly
because of medical implant or essential support devices. Despite
this fact, losses were similar in both the IG and the CG. Due to
the nature of the intervention, this could not be blinded to the
participants; however, a recent meta-epidemiological study [54]
suggested that blinding is less important than often believed.
The duration of the intervention was only 3 months, so we could
not measure the sustainability and long-term effect of the
intervention. Also, despite the advice provided to subjects at
baseline and follow-up visits to avoid the use of other apps
related to nutrition or physical activity, we cannot guarantee
that other apps were not used.
Conclusion
The results of this multicenter, randomized clinical trial study
showed that, compared with standard counselling alone, using
a self-reported app and a smart band obtained beneficial results
in weight loss in women and a reduction in BFM and PBF in
subjects with a BMI less than 30 kg/m2
and moderate-vigorous
physical activity level. Further studies are needed to ensure that
this profile benefits more than others from this intervention and
to investigate modifications of this intervention to achieve a
global effect.
