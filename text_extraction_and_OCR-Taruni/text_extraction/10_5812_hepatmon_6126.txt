Implication for health policy/practice/research/medical education:
Occult HBV infection has received increasing attention in recent years. Although the impact of occult HB in patients has not been 
determined, it appears to accelerate the progression of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis, ultimately leading to HCC. Occult HBV infection 
is unexpectedly frequent, in particular in hepatitis C virus (HCV) and in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected individuals. 
This phenomenon has also been reported in blood transfusion settings. Therefore, OBH has a great impact on public health issues 
regarding blood safety, HBV diagnosis, etc.
Context: Occult hepatitis B (OHB), or persistent HBV DNA in patients who are hepatitis B 
surface antigen (HBsAg) negative, is a recently recognized entity. In an attempt to sum￾marize the issues, this review presents an overview of the current proposed hypothesis 
on the clinical relevance and also updates the knowledge on the classification of OHB in 
different clinical settings.
Evidence Acquisition: OHB could be found in different population and clinical back￾grounds including: viral co-infections (with either human immunodeficiency or hepa￾titis C viruses), HBV chronic carriers, dialysis patients, transplantation settings and 
certain clinical situations (named in here: special clinical settings) with no apparent 
distinguishable clinical parameters.
Results: The exact magnitude, pathogenesis, and clinical relevance of OHB are unclear. 
Even the possible role exerted by this cryptic infection on liver disease outcome, and he￾patocellular carcinoma development remains unknown.
Conclusions: monitoring of Individuals with positive anti-HBc, mass immunization 
programs and improvement in diagnostic tools seem to be important to control the 
probability of transmission of HBV through cryptic HBV infection.

1. Context
1.1. Occult Hepatitis B in Clinical Settings
Occult hepatitis BHBV infection has been documented 
in a variety of clinical situations, especially among pa￾tients who are positive for anti-HBc (Table 1). Occult HBV 
infection is also commonly present in HCC, chronic hepa￾titis C virus (HCV) infection (1, 2), human immunodefi￾ciency virus (HIV) infection (3), liver-transplant recipients 
of a liver from a donor who was antibody to the hepatitis 
B core antigen (anti-HBc) from core-antibody-positive

donors (4), hemodialysis patients (5), healthy carriers, 
patients with cryptogenic advanced liver fibrosis (6), and 
special high-risk patients. 
2. Evidence Acquisition
The primary aims of this review were to: first, classify 
the different aspects of occult hepatitis in terms of clini￾cal classification. Second, to describe the prevalence of 
OBH in different clinical settings. Third, to introduce 
an up to date information regarding the clinical and 
transmission aspects of OBH. A comprehensive search 
of PubMed was performed with the following Mesh term 
search using keyword: occult hepatitis B infection along 
with keywords: HCV, HIV, Immunosuppression, HCC, 
transfusion and transplantation. All published data since 
2001 (the explanation of OBH) until May 2012 have been 
included in the study. The inclusion criteria for the study 
were: all studies that shown the presence of HBV DNA in 
the absence of HBsAg regardless of antibodies to core 
and/or surface proteins. 
3. Results
3.1. Transfusion Settings
The blood-safety issues related to the blood compo￾nents or tissues of HBsAg-negative donors and the risk 
of transmission are of great concern. Medical research￾ers fear that OHBI may be spread by blood transfusion 
because HBV-DNAHBV DNA detection by nucleic acid am￾plification technology is not mandatory for blood-donor 
screening in many countries, especially in those areas 
where the prevalence of escape mutants is expected to 
be high. Occult HBV infection may occur in several situ￾ations and, as a result, may be transmitted to other in￾dividuals through transfusion. Such situations include 
recovery from infection that leads to the production of 
anti-HBs but is characterized by persistent low-grade vi￾remia, production of ‘escape’ mutants that cannot be de￾tected by HBsAg testing, “carriers” with antibody to the 
hepatitis B e antigen (anti-HBe) and anti-HBc, and carriers 
that are negative for anti-HBe and anti-HBc. Although all 
of these situations can raise the transmission of HBV in 
the immune compromised, only the anti-HBc-positive, 
HBV-DNA-positive situation is infectious in the immune 
competent setting. Furthermore, Studies have clearly 
indicated that transfusion of HBsAg-negative, HBV DNA 
positive blood donor in blood supply was associated with 
the development of post-transfusion hepatitis B (7-9). The 
prevalence of OHB among HBsAg-negative donors varies 
in different parts of the world, and as mentioned above, 
depends on the endemicity of HBsAg carriers as well as 
the method used to test the virus. Reports from subsets 
of donors from North America and Western Europe have 
ranged from as low as 0 % (presence of anti-HBc) (10, 11) to 
as high as 2.8 % (isolated anti-HBc) (12, 13). Similarly, stud￾ies from Asia (especially from highly endemic regions) 
have indicated prevalence rates of HBV-DNAHBV DNA de￾tection among blood donors ranging from 0.13 (presence

of anti-HBc) (14, 15) to 8% (isolated anti-HBc) (16) (Table 1). 
As in other viral infections, HBV infectivity depends on 
two main factors: the infectious dose and the immune 
competence of the host. Considering the volume of in￾fectious material involved in the transfusion of whole 
blood or a blood component, it is generally accepted 
that should any HBV DNA be present, infection may oc￾cur (even with a viral load of < 20 IU/mL) (17). However, 
some scientists have argued that blood containing anti￾HBc with anti-HBs does not appear to transmit HBV com￾ponents (even through viral loads ranging between 20 
and 500 IU/mL) (8, 17) if the neutralizing antibody level 
is sufficiently high.
3.2. Chronic Carriers
OHB in apparently healthy HBV chronic carriers is es￾sentially found in four types of clinical conditions: 1) 
recovery from infection defined by the presence of anti￾HBs (spontaneous HBsAg seroclearance in a carrier) (18); 
2) chronic hepatitis, where the infection is related to es￾cape mutants that are not (or are only poorly) recognized 
by either natural polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies 
in the assays (19); 3) low-replicative phase of chronicity 
at the healthy carriage stage marked by the presence of 
anti-HBc, with or without detectable antibody to hepa￾titis B e antigen (anti-HBe) (20); and 4) chronic hepatitis 
or healthy carriage without any marker of HBV infection 
other than HBV DNA (21, 22), this illustrates the fact that 
some patients may have had serological markers of HBV 
infection, but subsequently lost them while still continu￾ing to have a low- grade HBV infection (22). OHB has been 
described in chronic HBV infection with different out￾comes from asymptomatic carriers to HCC patients with 
genotypes A through F and H (23-27). Several authors have 
investigated HBV influence ,and different HBV genotypes 
on OHB prevalence in specific regions. For instance, Wein￾berger et al. (28) suggested an association between occult 
HBV infection and genotype D in individuals from West￾ern Europe, where genotype A is more prevalent. How￾ever, the findings from a French study did not support 
this association (29). Cohort studies that include differ￾ent HBV genotype patients are needed to compare OHB 
implications in these genetic groups of patients HBV.
3.3. HCV
Among 350 million HBV carriers worldwide, the num￾ber of individuals with HCV–HBV dual infection is around 
5 – 7 million. However, it is very likely that the dual HBV–
HCV infection prevalence rate is underestimated because 
occult HBV infection is often not taken into account (30). 
Since HBV and HCV share many risk factors and the same 
transmission routes, the high prevalence of occult HBV 
infection reported in patients with chronic hepatitis C, 
ranging from 6.7% to 91.1%, is not surprising (31, 32). It is 
well established in the medical literature that HCV-pos￾itive HCV positive patients exhibit the anti-HBc-alone 
pattern more often than do HCV-negative HCV negative 
patients, and anti-HBc reported prevalence in patients 
with chronic HCV infection ranges from 28 % to 71 % (33-
35) (Table 1).
These differences in prevalence rates might be respon￾sible for inconsistencies in results on specimen types, 
recruitment of chronic HCV-infected patients, HBV infec￾tion endemicity in the study areas, and study methods in 
general. One clear example comes from Sagnelly et al. (31) 
who found prevalence rates of OHB in HCV -infected pa￾tients as high as 91.1 % in liver samples compared to just 
62.2 % and 32.4 % in PBMC and plasma samples, respective￾ly. Regarding the clinical consequences of occult HBV in￾fection in patients with chronic hepatitis C, studies have 
indicated the negative influence of cryptogenic HBV in￾fection on histologic activity and severity of liver disease 
and HCC, possibly by integration with the host genome 
or synthesis of pro-oncogenic proteins by free intrahe￾patic HBV genomes (34, 36-38). Also, in HCV- infected pa￾tients, occult HBV infection may contribute to increased 
plasma HCV-RNA loads and liver transaminase levels (39, 
40). On the other hand, some studies have reported that 
OHB occult HBV infection does not affect the pathological 
findings in the liver, changes in aminotransferase levels, 
or occurrence of HCC in patients with chronic HCV (32, 
41, 42). It should be noted, however, that all of these stud￾ies are cross-sectional, and therefore prospective studies 
are needed to confirm that occult HBV accelerates liver 
lesions progression in patients with chronic hepatitis C. 
Occult HBV infection also might affect the response to 
antiviral therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis C (43, 
44), but the available data do not allow any firm conclu￾sions in this regard, partly because of the heterogeneity 
of the patients enrolled, and the lack of data on care cur￾rent standards for treatment (45). One study (43) found 
that HCV patients with occult HBV had lower intrahepat￾ic mRNA levels of IFNAR2 (one of the two subunits of the 
IFN receptor), which the authors argued was one of the 
factors that could have led to a poor IFN response. How￾ever, the mechanism by which occult HBV may inhibit 
the patient’s response to IFN therapy in chronic hepa￾titis C remains unknown and therefore merits further 
research. Regarding the interaction between different 
HCV genotypes and OHB, Fukuda et al. (43) observed that 
patients with occult HBV infection were more frequently 
infected by HCV genotype 1a, but this association was not 
observed in other studies (32, 44). Altogether, these data 
highlight the clinical implications of occult HBV infec￾tion in the clinical setting of HCV infection and suggest 
that screening for OHB should be an essential practice.
3.4. HIV
Due to transmission shared modes and risk factors, co￾infection with HBV and HIV and even triple infection with 
HCIV is common. A high HBV DNA prevalence in HBsAg￾negative samples from HIV-positive patients indicates 

4 Published by Kowsar, © BRCGL 2012 Hepat Mon. 2012;12(8):e6126 
Alavian S M et al. Occult Hepatitis B (OBH) in Clinical Settings
that HIV infection is a risk factor for OHB (46). Indeed, 
many reports have indicated that HIV-infected patients 
are at a higher risk of HBV co-infection in many regions, 
as illustrated by HBsAg high prevalence in HIV-positive 
patients in comparison to HIV-negative patients (47, 48). 
The reported prevalence of OHB occult HBV among HIV￾infected patients has ranged from 0 % to 89.5 %, mostly in 
anti-HBc positive patients, with a considerable number 
of other studies reporting results between these two ex￾tremes (49-51) (Table 1). The variability between the stud￾ies may be explained by fluctuations in HBV-DNAHBV 
DNA replication over time (even when these assays are 
validated with high specificity and quite high sensitiv￾ity), HCV co-infection, or the impact of treatments that 
are active against both HIV and HBV, such as lamivudine 
and tenofovir. In addition, differences in risk factors for 
contracting HBV between the studied populations and 
regional differences in overall HBV prevalence may con￾tribute to the observed differences in occult HBV preva￾lence. Furthermore, such studies suffer from a lack of 
methodological standardization, limited sample sizes, 
and few prospective studies. Occult HBV infection clini￾cal significance in HIV-infected patients remains unclear. 
HBV reactivation from occult to overt HBsAg infection can 
occur in immune suppression clinical setting (52), which 
underscores the potential clinical significance of occult 
HBV infection in HIV-positive persons. Apart from HCV in￾fection influence on the prognosis of OHB and HIV, mul￾tiple studies have reported an association between occult 
HBV infection and flare-ups of hepatic transaminases (49, 
53, 54). One study found that these liver outbreaks were 
due to the restoration of adaptive HBV-specific immune 
response and innate nonspecific immune responses (55), 
although several other studies that compared the levels 
of liver enzymes in HIV patients with and without OHB 
were not able to confirm these response routes (51, 56-58). 
Longitudinal studies with longer periods of observation 
that examine other hepatic outcomes, such as hepatic 
fibrosis by liver biopsy and hepatocellular carcinoma, 
would provide more insight into occult HBV clinical im￾pact in HIV-infected individuals. The literature generally 
advocates that, for individuals co-infected with HBV and 
HIV, HBsAg- positive patients should be treated if their 
HBV DNA, or aminotransferase levels increase, or if they 
experience significant hepatic fibrosis (59). Still, clear 
guidelines have yet to be established for occult HBV co￾infection in HIV positive patients.
3.5. Cryptogenic Cirrhosis
Several studies have also demonstrated the presence of 
HBV DNA in the serum or livers of patients with crypto￾genic cirrhosis, who lack serologic markers for HBV and 
HCV (34, 60-63). The frequency of occult HBV infection in 
cryptogenic cirrhosis has ranged between 4.8 % and 40 % 
in various studies, depending on the prevalence of HBV 
in the study areas and the type of specimen studied (se￾rum or liver) (34, 60, 62, 64) (Table 1). OHB clinical features 
in these settings remain largely unknown. In the labora￾tory, no association was found between the presence of 
OHB and demographic, biochemical (AST, ALT), or sero￾logic features in cryptogenic cirrhotic patients, implying 
that none of these parameters were useful to distinguish 
OHB-positive from OHB negative patients. However, ob￾servations showed that OHB frequency increased in an￾ti-HBc positive patients isolates (regardless of anti-HBs 
positivity) (60-62, 64). Cirrhosis is generally considered 
as the most important risk factor for hepatocellular car￾cinoma development; therefore, in addition to its pos￾sible direct oncogenic properties, occult HBV infection 
may favor neoplastic transformation in infected patients 
through its contribution to cirrhosis.
3.6. Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)
Despite the strong association between HCC and sero￾positivity of HBsAg, almost all clinical and epidemiologi￾cal studies have observed HBsAg-seronegative patients 
affected by HCC and liver cirrhosis. A significant propor￾tion of these patients were seropositive on anti-HBs and 
anti-HBc seropositive and seronegative foron antibodies 
against hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV), especially in areas 
where HBV infection was hyperendemic (35, 65-68). Sev￾eral studies have reported HBV DNA detection in tumor￾ous liver tissue of HBsAg- negative HCC patients, with 
prevalence rates ranging from 30 % to 80 % (36, 69) (Table 
1). The major question that arises with this evidence is 
whether occult HBV infection alone causes HCC. The hy￾pothesis that OHB occult hepatitis retains the same pro￾oncogenic features,accelerates liver disease progression, 
and cirrhosis development (36) has been suggested by 
epidemiological and molecular studies and supported by 
animal models. Accordingly, experiments in animal mod￾els demonstrated that both woodchucks and ground 
squirrels, once infected by woodchuck hepatitis virus 
and ground squirrel hepatitis virus, respectively, were at 
high risk of developing HCC after the apparent clearance 
of the virus (70, 71). 
Three longitudinal follow-up studies showed the role 
of OHB in HCC development (65, 72, 73). In follow-up pe￾riods of 82.8 ± 32.6 months, eight out of nine patients 
who acquired HCC were OHB positive at the time of final 
follow-up (73). In a similar finding, in a period of 91.8 ± 
48.5 months, four out of eight OHB positive cases had 
acquired HCC (72). However, one follow-up study found 
a negative correlation (74); specifically, only one of seven 
OHB and HCV co-infected patients whose HCV was not 
without HCV eradicated ion with interferon therapy de￾veloped HCC during average periods of 58.6 ± 18.1 months. 
Future cohort studies must be performed to address this 
question. Mutational analysis in HBsAg-positive HCC ver￾sus HBsAg-negative patients showed multiple genetic 
variants in different parts of the HBV genome and regula￾tory regions (68, 75, 76); however, others did not find such 

5 Hepat Mon. 2012;12(8):e6126 Published by Kowsar, © BRCGL 2012

an association (41, 77). Furthermore, in a direct examina￾tion using cassette-ligation-mediated PCR in the junc￾tions between HBV DNA and human DNA, the integration 
of HBV DNA was identified in 10 out of 34 HCC patients, 
all of whom were OHB positive. Four of these integra￾tions were observed in chromosome 11q (78). Altogether, 
clear evidence exists that OHB infection HBV maintains 
its pro-oncogenic properties in case of occult HBV infec￾tion, possibly by integrating with the host genome, the 
synthesis of pro-oncogenic proteins by free intra-hepatic 
HBV genomes (33, 36, 47, 52, 64, 69), or by progression 
from through cirrhosis to hepatocellular carcinoma (73). 
However, to reach the conclusion that OHB plays a major 
role in hepatocellular transformation, additional studies 
on molecular pathogenesis and prospective molecular 
epidemiological studies are needed.
3.7. Immunosuppression
Hepatitis, due to reactivation of HBV, is now a well-rec￾ognized complication in patients with chronic HBV infec￾tion receiving cytotoxic, corticosteroid, or immunosup￾pressive therapy. In these cases reactivation of the virus 
may occasionally be present, leading to severe or even 
fulminant hepatic failure sometimes indistinguishable 
from de novo acute infection (34, 52, 79). Several reports 
have found that patients with hematological malignan￾cies had a high carrier rate of overt HBV (i. e., HBsAg 
positivebetween23.8 and 56 %) (80, 81). Also, evidence of 
previous HBV infection (especially the presence of anti￾HBc) varies among studies, rangingfrom37.8 % to 62.5 % 
(81-83) (Table 1). In this respect, HBV reactivation has been 
observed in two clinical settings: 1) advanced immune 
deficiency in patients with hematological-malignancy 
disorders, (such as acute leukemia, myeloproliferative 
disorders, lymphoproliferative disorders, and plasma 
cell dyscrasias,) at a prevalence of 3.3 % to 24 % (80-83); 
and 2) subjects who were HBsAg negative prior to chemo￾therapy (alkylators, antimetabolites, antitumor antibiot￾ics, corticosteroids, etc.) who underwent treatment and 
transplantation (bone marrow, liver, kidney, and hemato￾poietic stem-cell transplantation HSCT), especially those 
treated with the immune suppressive rituximab (anti￾CD20), alemtuzumab (anti-CD52), and infliximab (anti￾TNF) (82-84). The rate of reactivation after chemotherapy 
has been reported to range between 3.3 % and 4 % among 
OHB-positive immunosuppressed patients after treat￾ment (82, 83). However, there are numerous case reports 
of HBsAg-negative patients suffering from HBV reactiva￾tion after treatment by rituximab (84, 85), alemtuzumab 
(86, 87), and infliximab (as a therapeutic regimen for 
rheumatic and Crohn’s diseases) (88, 89) , and the num￾ber of these studies is increasing. HBV reactivation fol￾lowing chemotherapy can resolve, persist, recur, or lead 
to liver failure and death. However, viral proliferation 
and progression of the disease increase when patients 
with HBV infection immune response is suppressed by 
immune suppressive or cytotoxic agents. On the other 
hand, withdrawal of these agents leads to the immune￾mediated destruction of HBV-infected hepatocytes and 
hepatitis flares. Such flare-ups have been attributed to 
changes in equilibrium due to an enhanced immuno￾logical response to HBV during recovery from immune 
suppression (90, 91). In addition to the direct effects of 
immunosuppression, it has been indicated that the HBV 
genome contains a steroid-responsive DNA sequence 
that, when stimulated, results in an increase of HBsAg 
synthesis and HBV gene reactivation (92). 
3.8. Transplantation
One of the most important clinical implications of OHB 
is usually observed in the setting of liver transplantation. 
In particular, livers from donors with OHB carry a risk of 
HBV transmission with infection occurring in 25–95 % of 
the liver grafts donated from patients who are HBsAg neg￾ative but anti-HBc positive. This infection route is indis￾tinguishable from overt infection (9, 93-95) (Table 1). The 
significance of OHB in post-OLT (orthotropic liver trans￾plantation) settings is controversial. Upon intrahepatic 
HBV DNA analysis, some patients show high levels of liver 
or serum HBV DNA and a high rate of reactivation (96, 97), 
whereas, others show low HBV-DNAHBV levels of reactiva￾tion rates (93, 98, 99). However, it is postulated that most 
(if not all) researchers believe that OHB can be found in 
most recipients of livers from HBsAg-negative and anti￾HBc-positive liver donors. Studies have indicated that 
HBV DNA remains detectable in the serum or PBMCs of 
patients who are anti-HBV-positive HBV DNA positive and 
and HBsAg- negative for several years after removal of the 
HBV-infected liver (99), and extra-hepatic reservoirs serv￾ing as the source of reinfection (96). The majority of cases 
in these studies indicate that the tapering or withdrawal 
of immunosuppression occurred before reverse serocon￾version (100). The likelihood of HBV reactivation would 
be minimized enormously by immunization and pre￾emptive treatment with nucleos (t)ide analogue drugs 
as a standard strategy to prevent hepatitis B (79, 101). The 
need for antiviral therapy in anti-HBcAg- positive and HB￾sAg- negative patients is not defined well in the literature, 
and the results of some studies do not support a general 
recommendation for preemptive use of antiviral therapy 
in such patients (93, 99). On the other hand, other empiri￾cal findings suggest that continued treatment for at least 
10 years using an antiviral agent having a high resistance 
barrier with little or no resistance is required to achieve 
viral clearance while avoiding reactivation (96, 102). How￾ever, close monitoring of HBV DNA levels appears to be 
warranted. 
4. Conclusion
Additional studies in larger cohorts of patients with 
long-term clinical and laboratory follow-up are warrant-

ed to understand the biological basis and significance 
of occult HBV infection better, and to clarify the possible 
role exerted by this cryptic infection on the outcome 
of liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma develop￾ment. Individuals with occult HBV infection need to be 
monitored by follow-up studies to assess the markers of 
liver damage. Anti-HBc only subjects should be carefully 
monitored by follow-up studies to assess the significance 
in various clinical settings. Mass immunization of hepa￾titis B vaccine is important to control the transmission of 
HBV. Occult HBV infection is a frequent finding in cases 
with HIV/HCV co-infection making the virological sce￾nario characterizing this category of patients even more 
complex than believed formerly. It can be expected that 
while the burden of chronic hepatitis B will decrease due 
to the introduction of more effective antiviral therapies, 
occult HBV infection could become a main concern.
