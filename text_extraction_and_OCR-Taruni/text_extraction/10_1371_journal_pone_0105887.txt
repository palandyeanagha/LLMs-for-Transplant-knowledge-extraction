Abstract
Cerebral edema is the common pathogenic mechanism for cognitive impairment in minimal hepatic encephalopathy.
Whether complete reversibility of brain edema, cognitive deficits, and their associated imaging can be achieved after liver
transplantation remains an open question. To characterize white matter integrity before and after liver transplantation in
patients with minimal hepatic encephalopathy, multiple diffusivity indices acquired via diffusion tensor imaging was
applied. Twenty-eight patients and thirty age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers were included. Multiple diffusivity
indices were obtained from diffusion tensor images, including mean diffusivity, fractional anisotropy, axial diffusivity and
radial diffusivity. The assessment was repeated 6–12 month after transplantation. Differences in white matter integrity
between groups, as well as longitudinal changes, were evaluated using tract-based spatial statistical analysis. Correlation
analyses were performed to identify first scan before transplantation and interval changes among the neuropsychiatric
tests, clinical laboratory tests, and diffusion tensor imaging indices. After transplantation, decreased water diffusivity
without fractional anisotropy change indicating reversible cerebral edema was found in the left anterior cingulate,
claustrum, postcentral gyrus, and right corpus callosum. However, a progressive decrease in fractional anisotropy and an
increase in radial diffusivity suggesting demyelination were noted in temporal lobe. Improved pre-transplantation albumin
levels and interval changes were associated with better recoveries of diffusion tensor imaging indices. Improvements in
interval diffusion tensor imaging indices in the right postcentral gyrus were correlated with visuospatial function score
correction. In conclusion, longitudinal voxel-wise analysis of multiple diffusion tensor imaging indices demonstrated
different white matter changes in minimal hepatic encephalopathy patients. Transplantation improved extracellular cerebral
edema and the results of associated cognition tests. However, white matter demyelination may advance in temporal lobe.

Introduction
Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is frequently associated with a
wide range of neuropsychiatric abnormalities in liver cirrhosis, and
has been classified as a continuum from minimal HE (MHE) to
different grades of overt HE. [1] It is believed that cerebral edema
is the common pathogenic mechanism for cognitive impairment in
MHE and overt HE. [2,3] Although patients with MHE present as
essentially normal, such patients perform abnormally on psycho￾metric tests and have an increased risk of motor vehicle accidents.
Liver transplantation (LT) can correct liver function, resulting in
an improvement symptom of MHE. [4] However, at least during
the first 2 years after LT, some cognitive defects seem to persist to
some degree. [5] Thus, whether complete reversibility of brain
edema, cognitive deficits, and their associated imaging can be
achieved remains an open question.
The MHE patients can experience persistent cognitive deficits
after LT. [6] In addition, permanent brain injury with volume
atrophy has been found in those with previous episode of overt
HE. [6] Each of these observations suggests that cirrhosis may
cause brain damage that persists after LT. Some prospective
imaging studies have shown improvement in HE related brain
edema [7,8] after treatment, with such improvement being
primarily due to removal of interstitial type brain edema. [8]
However, it is also common for cirrhotic patients to experience
acute liver failure or overt HE accompanied by irreversible
cytotoxic cerebral edema. [9] The interaction or evolution
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 August 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 8 | e105887

between two forms of cerebral edema complicates the interpre￾tation of their effects on cognition outcomes after LT, a subject
which has not been studied in depth before.
Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) provides information about
different direction of water mobility, as well as information about
tissue microstructure and organization, through different quanti￾tative DTI metrics. In quantitative terms, mean diffusivity (MD),
an index of averaged diffusivity across three-dimensional space,
and fractional anisotropy (FA), an index of the microstructural
integrity of the brain’s white matter (WM), have been widely used
as quantitative metrics in previous studies. [10] Recently, the
directional diffusivities, axial diffusivity (Dax= l1) and radial
diffusivity [Drad= (l2+l3)/2], have been used to demonstrate the
advantage of obtaining additional information about the potential
underlying pathophysiology of WM changes. Alterations in Dax
suggest the presence of axonal damage and/or Wallerian
degeneration in the primary fiber orientation, [11] while increased
Drad implies demyelination or dysmyelination. [12] The widely
used DTI indices, FA and MD, are associated with cognitive
impairment in MHE patients before LT. [8,13] However, there
are no reports of longitudinal neuro-imaging studies investigating
changes in WM in MHE patients before and after LT through the
use of multiple diffusion indices. There is a paucity of knowledge
regarding the associations between clinical evaluations and the
characteristics of WM integrity evolution in MHE patients
receiving LT.
To elucidate the underlying WM microstructural changes
occurring in MHE patients, we used voxel-wise analysis of
multiple diffusivity indices before and after LT in this longitudinal
study, and compared the results with data from healthy volunteers.
We sought to determine (1) whether MHE patients show
deterioration of WM integrity after LT by assessing multiple
DTI indices (2) whether changes in WM integrity either affected
by baseline or interval changes in liver functions after LT and (3)
whether there is any correlation between WM integrity and
cognitive performance before and after LT.
Materials and Methods
1. Participants
A consecutive series of patients with liver cirrhosis who were
evaluated for LT were recruited to the study. The project was
approved by Chang Gung Memorial Hospital’s Institutional
Review Committee on Human Research, and all subjects gave
written informed consent before participating. All participants
were informed that the study was designed to evaluate manifes￾tations of MHE both before and at 6 to 12 months after LT.
The diagnosis of liver cirrhosis was based on a consistent clinical
history, radiological studies, and liver biopsy when available. [8]
Patient functional status was assessed using the Child-Pugh scoring
system. [14] According to Ferenci’s report, [15] MHE was
evaluated by the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale III (WAIS-III)
subtests, including the digit-symbol and block design subtests. [16]
A test result was considered abnormal for the digit-symbol and
block design subtests if it was 2 standard deviations below the
mean score of normal subjects. Thirty age- and sex-matched
normal subjects (19 men, 11 women; 52.8069.77 years) without
any medical history of neurological disease served as the control
group and were recruited by advertisement within the hospital.
The mean digit-symbol score for the normal controls was
57.28613.52 and the block design score was 40.50610.86.
Therefore, cirrhotic patients with a digit-symbol score of 30 or
lower or with a block design score lower than 19 were recognized
as having MHE.
Laboratory screening, MRI scans, and neuropsychiatric tests
were performed on the same day for all patients. Initially, 70
cirrhotic patients who completed the neuropsychological evalua￾tion and MRI examinations were enrolled in the study.
Participants were excluded if they were diagnosed with overt
HE or produced normal neuropsychological tests results. Any
history of drug abuse, psychiatric or neurological illness, head
injury, or poor image quality with severe distortion and metallic
artifacts that might compromise diffusion tensor image analysis
was also grounds for exclusion.
Finally, 28 adult cirrhotic patients with MHE (24 men, 4
women; 51.1468.38 years) were included in this study, and 42
patients were excluded (normal neuropsychiatric test results,
n = 29; overt HE, n = 9; poor image quality, n = 4).
2. Neuropsychological tests
A battery of neuropsychological tests, which focused on
attention, executive function, speech and language function, and
visuo-construction function, was performed. Different domains of
neuropsychological evaluations were measured by subtests from
Cognitive Ability Screening Instrument (CASI), [17] WAIS-III
[18] and Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST-64, Computer
Version Scoring Program). [19].
3. MRI data acquisition
Images were obtained using a 3.0-T whole body GE MR system
(Signa, General Electric Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI, USA) with a
standard eight-channel phase-array head coil. Participant head
movement inside the coil was minimized immobilization with
cushions. Whole brain DTI images were acquired using an axial
single-shot spin-echo diffusion-weighted echo-planer imaging
sequence, with array spatial sensitivity encoding to reduce
susceptibility and eddy-current distortions. The DTI imaging
parameters were as follows: repetition time (TR)/echo time
(TE) = 15800/77 ms, number of excitations (NEX) = 3, field of
view (FOV) = 256 mm2
, slice thickness = 2.5 mm, matrix dimen￾sions = 1286128, 55 slices without gaps, b-value = 1000 s/mm2
,
13 non-collinear diffusion directions and a non-diffusion-weighted
T2 images (b-value = 0 s/mm2
). The DTI session design was
based on the balancing of diffusion gradients to minimize eddy￾current artifacts.
Structural images were acquired using standard T1-weighted
three-dimensional fluid-attenuated inversion recovery fast spoiled
gradient-recalled echo pulse sequence with the following imaging
parameters: TR/TE/TI = 9.5/3.9/450 ms; flip angle = 15 de￾grees; NEX = 1; field of view = 240*240 mm2
; slice thick￾ness = 1.3 mm; matrix size = 512*512; voxel size = 0.47*0.47*1.3
mm3 and 110 contiguous slices that aligned to the anterior
commissure-posterior commissure.
Additional whole brain axial T2-weighted, and fluid-attenuated
inversion-recovery fast-spin-echo sequences were applied to define
anatomical details. One author blinded to participant status
visually checked all MRI scans to confirm that the participants
were free from morphological abnormalities. The total MRI
scanning time was approximately 23 min for each participant.
The mean duration between MRI acquisition at baseline and
follow up for the patient group was 8.43 months (range: 6.5 to 12
months).
4. DTI data preprocessing and voxel-wise WM
microstructure investigations
Image data was analyzed by a researcher with 8 years of
experience in MRI research using FSL v5.0.4 (Functional

current distortion. To further minimize motion effects in DTI
estimation, each applied gradient direction of the diffusion￾weighted image was reoriented to the corresponding transforma￾tion matrix that described the rotation parameters of subject
motion. [21] After skull stripping, diffusion indices were calculated
by fitting a tensor model using FMRIB’s Diffusion Toolbox.
Longitudinal voxel-wise analysis of WM microstructure was
performed using Tract-based Spatial-Statistic (TBSS), [22] which
has been described in detail in previous study. [23] First, all
subjects’ FA maps were non-linearly warped to the Montreal
Neurological Institute (MNI) space FMRIB58_FA template using
FMRIB’s nonlinear registration tool. Next, MNI space FA maps
were averaged and thinned to generate a mean FA skeleton; we
defined the WM skeleton threshold at an FA value greater than 0.2
to further reduce the partial volume effects. Each individual’s MNI
space FA map was projected onto the mean threshold skeleton and
the resulting data were subsequently fed into the statistical analysis
framework. The same registration procedures were applied to
MD, Dax, and Drad. An experienced neuroradiologist visually
checked all warped indices to ensure the accuracy of the whole
automatic image-preprocessing pipeline.
5. Group comparisons of T1 DARTEL VBM
T1 voxel based morphometry (VBM) with the diffeomorphic
anatomical registration through exponentiated lie algebra (DAR￾TEL) registration scheme was used for investigating gray matter
(GM) volume changes between study groups. [24,25] Individual
T1 scan were analyzed with the VBM8 toolbox (http://dbm.
neuro.uni-jena.de) with default settings under Statistical Paramet￾ric Mapping (SPM8; Wellcome Institute of Neurology, University
College London, UK). The detailed T1 DARTEL VBM pipeline
was the same with previous published study from our groups. [26]
In briefly, T1 structural scans were bias-corrected, tissue
segmented [segmented into GM, WM and cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF) compartments], and spatial normalized to MNI space using
affine and high dimensional DARTEL registration approach. To
conserve the total amount of GM before and after spatial
normalization, the nonlinear deformation parameters of the
spatial normalization procedure were used to modulate the GM
tissue segments and resized voxel sizes to 1.561.561.5 mm3
. This
non-linear only modulation procedure allow us to make inferences
on regional GM volume measurements rather than tissue density
(concentration) and further ensure that statistical comparisons are
made on relative (controlling for overall brain size) rather than
absolute volumes. The resultant MNI space modulated GM
segments were smoothed with a Gaussian kernel of 8 mm full￾width Gaussian kernel at half-maximum (FWHM) and served as
inputs for further voxel-wised group comparisons in GM volume.
The longitudinal T1 DARTEL VBM preprocessing module
with default setting in the VBM8 toolbox was used for
investigating the longitudinal GM volume changes before and
after liver transplantation in patients with cirrhotic. The following
preprocessing steps were used in this analysis: (1) the follow-up
measurement scan was registered to the baseline measurement
scan for each participants; (2) the mean T1 anatomical scan were
calculated from the realigned images from previous step of each
participant and served as a reference image for subsequent spatial
registration; (3) intra-subject bias correction for each time-point
realigned T1 anatomical scans were performed with regard to the
reference mean image; (4) the bias-corrected mean anatomical
scan and realigned scans were segmented into GM, WM and CSF
respectively; (5) spatial normalization parameter of DARTEL
registration algorithm were estimated using the tissue segments
(GM and WM) of the bias-corrected mean anatomical scan; (6) the
DARTEL normalization parameters were applied to the GM
tissue segments of bias-corrected realigned anatomical scan for
each time-point. Finally, the resulting MNI space GM tissue
segments were smoothed with 8 mm FWHM Gaussian kernel
which was also used in the previous cross-sectional analysis.
6. Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses of demographic data were performed
using the SPSS (version 12, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) with
appropriate tests. Age and sex were compared between the study
groups by the independent t-test and Pearson’s Chi-square test.
Laboratory data were compared between the patient groups
before and after LT by the pair t-test. The neuropsychological tests
were compared between groups by using independent t-test or the
pair t-test with correcting the multiple comparison problem using

false discovery rate (FDR). The statistical significant level for
neuropsychological tests were set as corrected PFDR ,0.05.
Group comparisons of diffusion tensor index. For image￾based voxel-wise analysis, non-parametric permutation-based
statistical analyses were performed to investigate regional WM
changes between baseline and follow-up scans of the patient and
control group (analysis of covariance model with age and sex as
covariates of no interest), and the longitudinal changes before and
after LT in the MHE group (paired t test). 5000 permutations were
used for each possible statistical contrast, and the results were
corrected for multiple comparisons across space using a threshold￾free cluster enhancement (TFCE) approach with family wised
error (FWE) corrected P value ,0.05. [27] Mean DTI indices
representing each significant cluster were calculated for each
participant and further correlated to clinical evaluations. Data was
adjusted for age and sex, and the relationships between regional
diffusivity indices, cognitive function, and laboratory test results
were investigated using partial Pearson correlation analysis. After
Bonferroni correction for the number of ROIs, the significance
threshold for the two-tailed partial correlation tests was set to a p￾value of less than 0.05 (the p-values were adjusted for the number
of regions by a factor of 5, similar to an uncorrected p = 0.05/5).
Group comparisons of gray matter volume. To ensure
that statistical thresholds in T1 DARTEL VBM and DTI TBSS
analysis were comparable, the smoothed modulated GM segments
were also analyzed using the same statistical design and statistical
criteria with a framework of permutation-based non- parametric
testing using FSL v5.0.4. The cluster-wised statistic with TFCE
clustering approach which used in the DTI-TBSS analysis was
used again to determine clusters with significant GM volume
changes, and FWE corrected P value ,0.05 was used to correct
for multiple comparisons across space.
Results
1. Clinical characteristics
LT significantly corrected liver function in MHE patients,
including prothrombin time (p,0.001), International Normalized
Ratio ratio (p,0.001), concentration of albumin (p,0.001), total
bilirubin (p = 0.04), and venous ammonia (p,0.001) (Table 1).
2. Neuropsychological performance
2.1 Differences in cognition performance between MHE
and controls before LT. The MHE patient group exhibited
significantdisturbances in executive function (Digit symbol,
p = 0.004; Abstraction, p,0.001). We also found a worse
performance of visuospatial function (Letter-number search,
p = 0.01; Block design, p = 0.04) and the CASI global performance
score (p = 0.02) but was not survived with correcting for multiple
comparisons (FDR,0.05). The group also displayed a trend of
lower attention, memory, and language function scores.
2.2 Differences in cognition performance between MHE
and controls after LT. After LT, the MHE patients presented
with poorer executive function in the abstraction test (p = 0.001)
compared to healthy subjects. The MHE group also had a trend of
lower memory and language function.
2.3 Longitudinal changes of cognition performance in
MHE patients. Longitudinal comparison after LT showed
significant improvements in executive function (digit-symbol test,
p = 0.006), and visuospatial function (picture completion,
p = 0.007; letter-number search p,0.001; block design, p = 0.009).

Mean Dax values were directly obtained from clusters showing significant changes between baseline and follow-up scan. Zmax values represent TFCE FWE-corrected clusters (p
,.05). Multiple brain atlases implemented in FSL were
used to define anatomical regions of significant clusters after statistical comparisons. Diffusivity values corresponding to each cluster with significant longitudinal changes are represented as differences (baseline – follow up) in MD
and Drad (mm2/s) multiplied by a factor of 106. Boldfaced diffusivity values with ‘‘*’’ represent significant differences (P,.05, Bonferroni-adjusted) between baseline and follow-up scans.

MHE patients. An exploratory group-wise comparison of the
MHE cohort before and after transplantation revealed that post￾LT, patients exhibited decreased Dax in several clusters, including
WM underlying the left anterior cingulate, right anterior cingulate,
left claustrum, and left postcentral gyrus (FWE-corrected p,0.05).
Further regional of interest analysis revealed that MD values also
decrease in the right anterior cingulate, left claustrum, and left
postcentral gyrus (Table 2; Figure 1).
After LT, the cluster in right temporal lobe had lower FA
associated with higher Drad and a trend-level increase in MD
among subjects with MHE vs. controls (Table 3; Figure 2).
4. Correlations between clinical laboratory tests and
extracted DTI indices in MHE patients
Before LT, higher albumin(baseline) levels were positively
associated with better MD (baseline-followup) recovery in right anterior
cingulate (r = 0.50, p = 0.01), indicating better correction of brain
edema after transplantation. After LT, we also found that
improvement of albumin(baseline-followup) levels were significantly
positively associated with recovery of Drad (baseline-followup) (r = 0.76,
p,0.001) and MD(baseline-followup) (r = 0.63, p = 0.001) values in
right anterior cingulate (Figure 3).
5. Correlations between neuropsychological tests and
extracted DTI indices in MHE patients
Improvement in visuospatial function (baseline-followup) (letter￾number search scores) was correlated with interval correction of
MD(baseline-followup) values (r = 20.54, p = 0.004) in the right
postcentral gyrus, after correction of the multiple comparisons.
6. Comparison of T1 DARTEL VBM between cirrhotics
patients before and after LT, and healthy subjects
The VBM analysis comparing cirrhotic patients before and after
LT, and control subjects included in the study were showed in
table S1 and figure S1. Before LT, there was a significant smaller
gray matter volume in cerebellum and putamen, and larger gray
matter volume in thalamus in cirrhotic patients compared to
healthy subjects. After LT, post-LT groups showed smaller gray
matter volume only in putamen compared to healthy subjects.
Comparison between pre- and post-LT group showed recovery of
the gray matter volume occurred in postcentral gyrus, cerebellar
tonsil and inferior frontal gyrus. Our results were partially
supported previous findings. [28,29].
Discussion
We used TBSS with multiple diffusivity indices to investigate
specific information about the pathogenesis of observed WM
changes in MHE patients during pre-LT and post-LT periods. We
demonstrated that MHE patients might undergo different types of
WM changes before and after LT. Improved WM indices in MHE
patients who subsequently experienced cognitive recovery arose
primarily from the edematous effect; however after LT, progres￾sive demyelination occurred in temporal WM, a finding which has
not been previously reported. The recovery from WM edema,
particularly in the right anterior cingulate, is predictable from Pre￾LT albumin levels, and albumin(baseline-followup). Our results showed
that most of the tissue microstructure changes in patients with liver
cirrhosis are reversible.
Evaluation of multiple DTI indices facilitated our investigation
into the histology of WM and the possible etiologies of disease
evolution in vivo. After LT, the regional decreases in MD in the
bilateral anterior cingulate, left claustrum, and left postcentral
gyrus are driven by decreased Dax levels, and not by decreased
Drad. Significant decreases in Dax, and an MD index with
unchanged FA and Drad values after LT suggested decreased tissue
water diffusivity without changes to fiber integrity or cell damage.
Chavarria et al performed a biexponential analysis of DTI, and
reported that MD increased from a ‘‘fast diffusion pool’’ that

returned to normal after LT, and concluded that cerebral edema is
majorly extracellular. [30] However, intra-astrocytic accumulation
of osmotic materials had promoted astrocyte swelling as a
common pathogenetic endpoint of chronic liver cirrhosis. Our
results do not fully explain the movements of cerebral water, but
may indicate the coexistence of extracellular and intracellular
edema in MHE. Thus, histologically tolerable myelin and axonal
loss without reactive astrocytosis may allow the reversibility of DTI
indices after LT. [31].
Six months after LT, patients exhibited significant improve￾ments in all cognitive domains, except for memory, speech, and
language functions. The DTI indices improved mainly for the
frontal and parietal lobes and for the limbic system, which are
important for most executive, coordination, and visuospatial
functions. Not all cognitive recovery is directly associated with
the observed improvements in WM DTI indices, and changes in
DTI indices might result from other contributing factors, such as
reductions in gray matter edema or gray matter atrophy in present
and other study. [28,29] However, the significant correlation
between decreased MD, especially in the postcentral gyrus, and
improvement in visuospatial function after LT provides support
for our conclusion that chronic HE affects the superior parietal
and posterior frontal convexities most significantly, [31] which are
responsible for the identification and visuospatial location of a
stimulus. [32].
The concentration of albumin in plasma is usually low in
patients with cirrhosis and HE, and greater change in albumin
levels results in better DTI indices. The administration of human
albumin in patients with hepatorenal syndrome and spontaneous
bacterial peritonitis has a major impact on the prognosis of these
complications. [33] The mechanism of action may involve the
maintenance of oncotic pressure and scavenging of toxic
substances present in blood, which reduces the risk of intracellular
edema and neurological injury. [34] In addition, lower albumin
levels may occur in cases of malnutrition, which has been linked to
decreased DTI indices in liver cirrhosis. [35] Our findings suggest
that microstructural changes that result from cerebral edema
might arise from decreases in albumin levels, and may reverse
during clinical recovery.
Another important finding was a progressive decline in FA in
the right temporal lobe, even after LT. Decreased FA has been
reported for patients with low grade HE before receiving LT, [13]
and decreased WM density in the temporal lobe had also been
observed in patients with cirrhosis. [28] The extension and size of
the affected areas is greater, a greater degree of liver failure with
the antecedent of overt HE is more common in patients with
alcoholic cirrhosis. [28] These effects can continue even after LT;
the parahippocampus and the hippocampus are extremely
sensitive to hypoxia. [36] Episodes of HE usually lead to swelling
of astrocytes, cytotoxic edema, and intracranial hypertension, and
such occurrences increase the stress of hypoxia. In fulminate HE,
significant decreases in MD and FA values failed to recover in a
follow-up study, [9] suggesting that damage from hypoxia with
cytotoxic edema might increase vulnerability to irreversible WM
damage in the temporal lobe. In addition, immunosuppressive
agent used to prevent graft-versus-host disease has also been
associated with several side-effects, including hypertension and
neurotoxicity. Although the mechanism of their neurotoxicity are
not well known, cerebral vasculopathy [37] and hypertensive
encephalopathy [38] had been associated to brain injury and some
of the toxicity from particular immunosuppressive agent can
mainly manifest as white matter brain lesions. Longitudinal,
multiple sections evaluation might help to clarify the effects from
immunosuppressive agents to brain microstructure in the future.

In the present study, we interpreted decreased FA and increased
Drad in the temporal lobe, without changes in Dax, as demyelin￾ation and gliosis, consistent with histological findings. [31] The
WM in MHE patients might present with mixed effects, [30] from
longstandingvasogenic edema secondary to cirrhosis, episodic
acute cytotoxic edema, secondary to hyperammonemic decom￾pensation and/or neurotoxicity effect from immunosuppressive
agent.
In the present study, the changes in WM integrity were as subtle
as the cognition deficits in MHE patients when compared with
healthy subjects. The healthy condition in patients with minimal
HE is quite good showing limited cognitive decline before
operation. This is somewhat reasonable that we could not find
any difference between the patient group and healthy controls
with the conservative statistical threshold. We reported more
strictly statistical criteria which may increase specificity, but also
reduces the sensitivity necessary for detecting subtle temporal
changes in WM. In addition, cerebrovascular small-vessel
degeneration in the temporal lobe and other WM could not be
totally excluded in MHE [39] because an interval-imaging study
was not performed on the normal groups, however, changes in the
WM of healthy participants over a short duration can be limited.
Conclusions
Our longitudinal voxel-wise multiple DTI indices study revealed
various WM changes, including improvement of the extracellular
cerebral edema and of the demyelination of vulnerable WM that
occur in MHE patients accepting liver transplantation. DTI may
be useful for investigating the pathogenesis of MHE for adequate
interpretation of cognitive impairment and for assessing the
efficacy of therapeutic measures focused on correcting this
disorder.
