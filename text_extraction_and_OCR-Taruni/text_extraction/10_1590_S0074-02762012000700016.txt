Hepatitis E, which is caused by infection with the 
hepatitis E virus (HEV), is a major public health concern 
in developing and industrialised countries. This member 
of the Hepevirus genus, which belongs to the Hepeviri￾dae family, is a non-enveloped, single-stranded, positive￾sense RNA virus with a 7.2 kb genome that consists of 
three discontinuous open reading frames (ORFs) (Emer￾son & Purcell 2006). The mammalian HEV is classified 
into four genotypes and one serotype; recently, novel un￾classified strains were described in rabbits and rats (Lu 
et al. 2006, Zhao et al. 2009, Johne et al. 2010). 
In developing countries, HEV outbreaks are mainly 
caused by infection with genotypes 1 and 2. Hepatitis E 
is recognised as a zoonotic disease with sporadic cases 
in industrialised countries, caused by genotypes 3 and 
4, for which pigs are the main reservoirs (Meng 2010). 
Autochthonous hepatitis E in non-endemic countries is 
often confused with drug-induced liver injury (Dalton et 
al. 2007). In the general population, the disease is often 
asymptomatic, although people with underlying chronic 
liver disease are at risk of developing and dying from 
fulminant hepatic failure in approximately 70% of infec￾tion cases (Dalton et al. 2008). 
Occupational exposure to pigs by farmers, veteri￾narians, butchers and slaughterhouse workers has been 
linked to an increased risk of HEV infection (Galiana et 
al. 2008). The potential for domestic and wild swine to act 
as vehicles for HEV transmission has been linked to the 
consumption of raw or undercooked meat or viscera (Li 
et al. 2005, Colson et al. 2010). Other routes of zoonotic 
infection, such as direct exposure to pigs and pig faeces 
or environmental contamination, should not be excluded. 
In Brazil, the incidence of HEV infection in humans has 
been of minor concern. Previous reports showed that 
the overall HEV seroprevalence in the healthy popula￾tion is approximately 4% (de Paula et al. 2001). In pigs, 
genotype 3 of HEV has been reported from pig farms and 
slaughterhouses in several regions of Brazil [the states 
of Mato Grosso, São Paulo (SP), Rio de Janeiro (RJ) and 
Pará (PA)] (Paiva et al. 2007, dos Santos et al. 2009, 2011, 
de Souza et al. 2012).
Brazil is one of the most important pork producers and 
exporters in the world. The South Region, including the 
states of Paraná (PR), Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do 
Sul, is one of the largest pig-producing regions in the coun￾try. The objective of this study was to evaluate the pres￾ence of HEV in porcine liver and bile samples at a slaugh￾terhouse in PR and to perform a phylogenetic analysis of 
swine and human HEV strains circulating in Brazil for a 
comparison with strains circulating in other countries.
Liver and bile samples were collected from 118 adult 
pigs at one slaughterhouse in PR, which is under the 
control of the Federal Inspection Service. The samples 
were obtained in July of 2010 and were drawn from 
healthy animals with an estimated age of 25 weeks or 
older that were farmed in 10 different herds in the west￾ern region of PR. A total of 10-15 samples from each 
herd were obtained. Each bile sample was withdrawn 
with a sterile disposable syringe using a needle punc￾ture through the gallbladder and one part of the inner 
liver was excised using a new sterile scalpel blade for 
each specimen. The samples were stored at -20ºC until 
the analysis. Bile samples were suspended in 10% (w/v) 
diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water (InvitrogenTM Life 
Technology, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Liver tissue was dis￾rupted manually and subsequently homogenised in 10% 
(w/v) phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.2) and clarified by 
centrifugation for 10 min at 3,000 g.
Viral RNA was extracted from 400 µL aliquots of 
the liver and bile suspensions using a combination of 
phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol and silica/guanidine 
isothiocyanate methods (Alfieri et al. 2006). Both the

The objective of this study was to detect and identify hepatitis E virus (HEV) strains in liver and bile samples from 
slaughtered pigs in the state of Paraná, Brazil. Liver and bile samples were collected from 118 asymptomatic adult 
pigs at a slaughterhouse in a major Brazilian pork production area. The samples were assayed using a nested reverse 
transcription-polymerase chain reaction protocol with primer sets targeting open reading frames (ORF)1 and 2 of 
the HEV genome. HEV RNA was detected in two (1.7%) liver samples and one (0.84%) bile sample using both primers 
sets. The HEV strains were classified as genotype 3b on the basis of their nucleotide sequences. These data suggest 
that healthy pigs may be a source of HEV infection for consumers of pig liver and slaughterhouse workers in Brazil.

936 HEV from a Brazilian slaughterhouse • Noemi Rovaris Gardinali et al.
liver and bile samples were assayed using nested reverse 
transcription-polymerase chain reaction nested (RT￾PCR) with primers targeting ORF2 and the methyltrans￾ferase region of ORF1 of the HEV genome as previously 
described (Wang et al. 1999, Huang et al. 2002). 
RT reactions were performed using 5 µL of the ex￾tracted RNA; the reverse primer set was used at a con￾centration of 20 µM (3517N/ConsORF1-a1) and ultrapure 
sterile water was added to a final volume of 10 µL. The 
initial denaturation step was performed at 97ºC for 5 
min. The samples were then placed on ice for 5 min and 
10 µL of RT mix containing 1x RT buffer (50 mM Tris￾HCl pH 8.3; 3 mM MgCl2
; 75 mM KCl), 0.1 mM of each 
dNTP (Invitrogen Life Technology, Carlsbad, CA, USA), 
10 mM DTT, 100 units of M-MLV reverse transcriptase 
(Invitrogen Life Technology, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and ul￾trapure sterile water were added to a final volume of 20 
µL. The solution was incubated at 42ºC for 30 min fol￾lowed by enzyme inactivation at 94ºC for 5 min.
The first round of PCR was performed using 8 µL of 
cDNA added to 42 µL of PCR mix containing 1.5x PCR 
buffer (30 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.4; 75 mM KCl), 2 mM 
MgCl2
, 0.2 mM of each primer (3156N-3157N/ORF2 and 
ConsORF1-s1-ConsORF1-a1/ORF1), 2.5 units of Plati￾num Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen™ Life Technology, 
SP, BR) and ultrapure sterile water to a final volume of 
50 µL. The amplification was performed with the follow￾ing cycling profile: an initial denaturation step of 2 min at 
94ºC followed by 40 cycles of 1 min at 94ºC, 1 min at 42ºC 
(ORF2)/50ºC (ORF1) and 1 min at 72ºC and a final exten￾sion step of 7 min at 72ºC. For the second round of PCR, 
3 µL of DNA were added to 47 µL of nested PCR mix, 
which was similar to the PCR mix, except that the primer 
sets 3158N-3159N/ORF2 and ConsORF1-s2-ConsORF1-
a2/ORF1 were used. A total of 30 cycles identical to those 
used in the first round of PCR were performed.
The amplified fragments of ORF1 (287 bp) and ORF2 
(348 bp) were extracted from agarose gels using GFX™ 
PCR DNA and a Gel Band Purification Kit (GE Health￾care, Little Chalfont, UK) and were quantified using a 
QubitTM fluorometer (Invitrogen, Molecular Probes, 
Eugene, OR, USA). The fragment sequences were ob￾tained using the DYEnamic ET Dye Terminator Kit (GE 
Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) in a MegaBACE 1000/
Automated 96 Capillary DNA sequencer, using Thermo 
Sequenase™ II DNA Polymerase and the DYEnamic™ 
ET Dye Terminator Kit (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, 
UK). A phylogenetic tree was constructed from the nu￾cleotide (nt) sequences using the MEGA package version 
4.1 with the neighbour joining method and the Kimura 
2-parameter distance correction. The HEV strains iden￾tified in this study were designated as BRsw-A (Gen￾Bank IDs JN166093 and JX123025) and BRsw-B (Gen￾Bank IDs JN166094 and JX123026). 
The nested RT-PCR assay targeting two different re￾gions of the HEV genome (ORF1 and ORF2) amplified 
HEV RNA in two of 118 (1.7%) liver samples and in one 
of 118 (0.84%) bile samples. The ORF1 and ORF2 prim￾er sets showed no difference in their sensitivity to HEV 
RNA detection. HEV genomic RNA was detected in the 
liver and bile of one pig and in the liver of a second pig. 
The two animals were from different pig herds. 
HEV sequences obtained from the bile and liver 
specimens of the same animal (A) shared nt identity of 
100%. The ORF1 and ORF2 sequences from the liver 
of animal B showed nt identities of 99.5% and 99.6%, 
respectively, with the sequences from the liver and bile 
of animal A. The amplified ORF1 products of the HEV 
genome shared 82-94.2% nt identity with genotype 3 
HEV strains. The ORF1 sequences showed a maximum 
nt identity to JYK-Sap03 (AB189931) and E21-YKH00 
(AY684248) human HEV strains detected in Japan, with 
94.2% and 93.4% nt identity, respectively. The sequences 
were also closely related (89.4% identity) to HEV strain 
h1, the only human autochthonous case of hepatitis E 
reported in Brazil (Lopes dos Santos et al. 2010). Our 
obtained sequences also shared 82.8-83.3% nt identity 
with porcine strains (SW1 and SW2) previously detected 
by dos Santos et al. (2009) in pig herds from RJ and they 
shared 85.5-87.2% nt identity with strains E1, B24 and 
B51 from a pig slaughterhouse from the same region (dos 
Santos et al. 2011). The phylogenetic analyses revealed 
that the wild-type Brazilian porcine HEV strains from 
the present study clustered together with strains charac￾terised as genotype 3 subtype 3b (Fig. 1).
The swine HEV ORF2 sequences identified in this 
study showed nt identity between 78-89.7% with geno￾type 3 strains. The nt identity between these new Bra￾zilian swine sequences and the previously described 
Brazilian swine HEV strains SW2, SW3, SW4 and SE￾BR (Paiva et al. 2007, dos Santos et al. 2009) ranged 
between 78.5-82.3%. The topology of the phylogenetic 
tree obtained for the ORF2 region (Fig. 2) was similar 
to that generated for the ORF1 fragments. Therefore, 
the sequences from both regions confirmed that all of 
the Brazilian swine HEV isolates identified in this study 
clustered with genotype 3b HEV strains, thereby provid￾ing validation of these results. 
The nested RT-PCR assays used in the present study 
revealed that the presence of HEV in slaughtered pig 
livers and bile is not rare, as only a small number of 
samples from each herd was collected (10-15 samples 
from each herd). HEV detection is higher when pigs are 
between two-four months old, compared to the finishing 
phase of production (approximately 6 months in Brazil) 
and the virus is expected to be cleared in the majority of 
the slaughtered animals. Nevertheless, in previous study 
in Brazil, HEV genotype 3b was detected at a swine 
slaughterhouse in the Southeast Region (RJ) in 9.6% of 
the bile samples; however, liver samples were not evalu￾ated by dos Santos et al. (2011). Furthermore, different 
swine HEV genotypes (3c and 3f) were detected in 4.8% 
of serum, faecal and liver samples from slaughtered pigs 
in the Eastern Brazilian Amazon (de Souza et al. 2012). 
Therefore, the detection of HEV genome in slaughtered 
pigs from PR in this study confirms these previous re￾ports and suggests that healthy pigs are potentially the 
main reservoirs of HEV in Brazil. 
Individuals with professional contact with pigs or 
their environment have high rate of anti-HEV IgG sero￾positivity and may be at a higher risk of HEV infection 
than the general population (Meng et al. 2002). The con-

sumption of offal, including smoked but uncooked pig 
liver and blood obtained from grocery stores, has been 
related to HEV infections in Europe, thereby indicating 
that HEV transmission could occur through fresh pork 
sausages known as figatellu (Colson et al. 2010). In the 
present study, HEV was found in pig livers that could be 
used in sausages and consumed, especially in homemade 
sausages that also include blood and intestinal tracts 
(i.e., offal that are also infected with HEV). Brazilian 
subjects who consume contaminated pork products, es￾pecially raw or undercooked pig liver, as well as subjects 
who come into close contact with infected pigs, have a 
potential risk of becoming infected with HEV.
In slaughtered pigs, HEV RNA is most frequently de￾tected in bile and faecal samples and when at least two 
different regions of the HEV genome are targeted for 
amplification (de Deus et al. 2007, di Bartolo et al. 2011, 
de Souza et al. 2012). In the present study, two different 

938 HEV from a Brazilian slaughterhouse • Noemi Rovaris Gardinali et al.
primer sets targeting ORF1 and ORF2 of the HEV ge￾nome were used to test bile and liver samples from all ani￾mals, although faeces and sera were not evaluated. Unlike 
in previous reports, HEV RNA was not most frequently 
detected in the bile samples. It is possible that the lower 
abundance (1.7%) of HEV genotype 3 detected here com￾pared to previously reports of slaughtered Brazilian pigs 
[9.6% (dos Santos et al. 2011) and 4.8%, (de Souza et al. 
2012)] can be explained by the absence of other types of 
samples from the same animal used in the present study. 
The results of the present study raise public health 
concerns in Brazil because HEV could be detected in 
healthy pigs under the control of the Federal Inspection 
Service at the time of slaughter. These contaminated 
animal products are in close contact with slaughterhouse 
workers and the offal may be commercialised as food. 
The prevalence of HEV infection in humans in Brazil is 
unknown. However, serological studies have suggested 
that subclinical or undiagnosed HEV infections are pos￾sible (Carrilho et al. 2005). Additionally, the only human 
autochthonous case reported in Brazil (Lopes dos Santos 
et al. 2010) suggested a zoonotic origin of infection via 
the consumption of infected pork meat. The phylogenet￾ic analysis classified this Brazilian human HEV strain as 
belonging to the 3b genotype, which is the same geno￾type as the pig strains that were detected in this study.

In conclusion, this study demonstrates that slaugh￾terhouse workers are potentially exposed to HEV from 
healthy pigs in Brazil. Additionally, pig liver and offal 
can act as HEV vehicles to consumers that eat raw or un￾dercooked pork products. Considering HEV circulation 
in Brazil and that the clinical presentation of hepatitis E 
is similar to that of other forms of acute hepatitis, HEV 
should be included in the differential diagnosis of pa￾tients with unexplained hepatitis. Therefore, additional 
studies must be performed to determine the extent to 
which pig liver and offal contaminated with HEV repre￾sent a public health concern, not only in PR, RJ and PA, 
as reported recently, but also in other regions of Brazil.
