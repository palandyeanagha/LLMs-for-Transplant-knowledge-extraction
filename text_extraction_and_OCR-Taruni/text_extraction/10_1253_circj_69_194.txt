iventricular pacing (BVP) is currently indicated for
the treatment of patients with medically refractory
heart failure and electrical dyssynchrony,1–4 but it is
becoming increasingly clear that QRS duration is an inade￾quate predictor of the response to BVP therapy.4–6 Because
the improvement in mechanical dyssynchrony after BVP
correlates with improvement in clinical status and reverse
remodeling,6–12 there are ongoing investigations to deter￾mine the most accurate and efficient method of detecting
mechanical dyssynchrony. Echocardiography, including
tissue Doppler imaging (TDI), is simple, easy and ideal for
evaluating regional wall motion.5–13 Furthermore, recent
advances in TDI and strain Doppler imaging (SDI) have
enhanced the ability to evaluate ventricular synchrony and
regional myocardial function.5–16 However, the utility and
efficacy of TDI and SDI for evaluating ventricular syn￾chrony and function and for predicting long-term clinical
improvement in patients undergoing BVP have not been
sufficiently determined. The purpose of this study was to
clarify this point.
Methods
Study Population
This study included 17 patients with advanced heart fail￾ure and a wide QRS complex who received a pacemaker or
an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) providing
BVP. There were 12 men and 5 women, and their mean age
was 66±9 years; 13 patients had idiopathic cardiomyopa￾thy, 2 had ischemic heart disease, and the remaining 2 had
valvular heart disease; 11 patients were in New York Heart
Association (NYHA) functional class IV, and the remain￾ing 6 were in class III despite maximal pharmacologic
therapy at the time of pacemaker implantation. The QRS
interval was >140 ms and the left ventricular (LV) ejection
fraction determined by echocardiography was <40% in all
the patients.
Patients were divided into 2 groups according to their
clinical status at the end of the follow-up period (23±7
months; range: 14–37 months): the responder group (n=12)
and the nonresponder group (n=5; Table 1). The clinical
status of each patient was determined at the end of the
follow-up period by 2 cardiologists who did not have any
information concerning the BVP status of the patients. A
responder was defined as a patient who improved clinically
to NYHA functional class I or II during the follow-up
period and a nonresponder was one who did not. There was
no significant difference between the 2 groups in the
NYHA classification before the initiation of BVP (p=0.9;
Table 1).

Background The purpose of this study was to determine the utility and efficacy of tissue Doppler imaging
(TDI) and strain Doppler imaging (SDI) for evaluating ventricular synchrony and function, and for predicting the
long-term clinical improvement in patients undergoing biventricular pacing (BVP).
Methods and Results TDI and SDI were performed before and <1 month after initiating BVP in 17 patients
with advanced heart failure. An intraventricular conduction delay between the left ventricular (LV) septal and
lateral walls was measured by TDI. The average LV strain (LV-strain) was calculated from data obtained at the
center of 6 regions of the LV (base and mid-point between the basal and apical portions, and the mid-point
between these 2 points on the septal and lateral walls). During a 23±7 month follow-up period, 12 patients
improved clinically and did not require re-hospitalization for heart failure (responder group), but the remaining 
5 did not improve (nonresponder group). Before BVP, the intraventricular conduction delay was greater in the
responder group than in the nonresponder group (p<0.01), but after BVP, it did not differ between the 2 groups.
LV-strain improved after BVP in the responder group but not in the nonresponder group (p<0.05).
Conclusion A high intraventricular conduction delay before BVP and decreased strain shortly after BVP may
predict long-term clinical improvement in patients undergoing this treatment. (Circ J 2005; 69: 194 – 200)

Device Implantation
At the time of implantation of the pacemaker, 11 patients
were in sinus rhythm and had left bundle-branch block, 
and the remaining 7 were in chronic atrial fibrillation with
bradycardia and had already received right ventricular (RV)
pacing. These 7 patients underwent a procedure to revise
the RV pacing system to allow BVP, and all ventricular
activation occurred through the pacing leads after initiation
of this type of pacing. In 11 patients who were in sinus
rhythm at the time of BVP initiation, an atrial lead was
implanted in the right atrial appendage, and a RV lead was
placed at the RV apex. In the 7 patients in chronic atrial fib￾rillation who underwent revision of the RV pacing system
to a BVP system, the LV lead was connected to the atrial
port of the pacemaker, and the RV lead was attached to the
ventricular port. The atrioventricular delay was programmed
to its minimal value (10 ms or 30 ms), so that BVP con￾sisted of LV pacing followed 10 ms or 30 ms later by RV
pacing.
The LV pacing lead was inserted by the transvenous
approach through the coronary sinus, and placed in the left
marginal or postero-lateral cardiac vein in 15 patients. The
remaining 2 patients had the epicardial pacing wires placed
in the anterolateral portion of the LV. The RV pacing lead
was placed in the RV apex in all the patients.
Tissue Doppler Imaging (TDI) and Strain Doppler 
Imaging (SDI)
TDI and SDI were performed before and shortly after
(<1 month) initiating BVP in all the patients. LV dimen￾sions were measured by M-mode echocardiography in the
parasternal long-axis view. The LV end-diastolic dimen￾Table 1 Clinical Characteristics Before Biventricular Pacing

sion (LVEDd) was measured at the onset of the QRS
complex, and the LV end-systolic dimension (LVESd) was
defined by the smallest LV cavity. Pulsed-wave (PW) TDI
and SDI were performed with a Vivid 7 echocardiography
system (GE Vingmed Ultrasound, Horten, Norway) after
completing conventional echocardiography. Images were
obtained using a 1.5–4.0 MHz phased array transducer
(M3S transducer; GE Vingmed Ultrasound) at a depth of
10–16 cm in the LV apical 4-chamber view. The image
sector width was set as narrow as possible to allow a frame
rate acquisition greater than 100 frames/s. At least 2 cine
loops of raw TDI data, each containing 3 cardiac cycles,
were stored online as digital scan-line data using the Vivid
7 scanner and were retrieved later and analyzed using the
built-in analysis tools. Two experienced observers who
were familiar with TDI and SDI and unaware of the clinical
status of the patients analyzed the data.
Intraventricular conduction delays in the LV were mea￾sured by TDI.9–11 The region of interest (ROI) was posi￾tioned at the base of each of the septum and lateral wall 
of the LV, and the time from the onset of the QRS to the
peak myocardial sustained systolic velocity was measured
(Fig 1). The peak myocardial sustained systolic velocity
was defined as the maximum velocity during systole, ex￾cluding the isovolumic contraction.6,17 The time difference
between the 2 regions was defined as the intraventricular
conduction delay in the LV. To avoid artifact, the peak
myocardial sustained systolic velocity was examined in at
least 2 cine loops. We confirmed that the regional myo￾cardial velocity curves obtained by TDI were identical or
nearly identical, and 2 beats were measured and averaged
for each measurement.
As a measure of regional ventricular performance, we
determined the peak myocardial strain at the center of 6
regions of the LV (base, mid-point between the basal and
apical portions, and the mid-point between the 2 points on
the septal and lateral walls; Fig 2) during a stable cardiac
cycle, and the average LV strain (LV-strain) and coefficient
of variation of the LV strain (CV-strain) were calculated as
previously reported.14 The peak strain in each segment was
determined as the difference in strain measured from the
onset of the QRS complex to the nadir of the strain tracing.15
We also calculated the coefficient of variation for the time
at which the maximum strain was recorded in each region
(CV-time).14 As with the TDI measurements, 2 consecutive
beats were measured and averaged for each measurement.
We used an oval ROI (6×8mm) with careful alignment of
the cursor with the wall direction in any given region
measured. The strain can be estimated by calculating 
the velocity gradient between the 2 points with the equa￾tion: strain = dt.15,16 An offset of ∆r =
12 mm was used in all studies.
Echocardiographic parameters, including TDI and SDI,
were also obtained in 6 responders and 2 nonresponders
12±6 months after undergoing the BVP to assess its long￾term effectiveness.
Other Measurements and Analysis
To determine the predictors of clinical improvement in
patients undergoing BVP, the incidence of re-hospitaliza￾tion for heart failure, QRS duration, and echocardiographic
measurements shortly after BVP was initiated were also
compared between the 2 groups.
Statistical Analysis
Continuous variables are expressed as the mean ±1 stan￾dard deviation. Student’s t-test was used to compare 2
groups. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used when
comparisons involved >2 groups. When group differences
were found, one-way ANOVA was followed by the Fisher’s
protected least significant difference method to test the
significance of the difference among means in all groups.

Categorical variables were compared using chi-squared
analysis using the Yate’s correction if necessary. An overall
chi-square test for a 2×n table was performed when com￾parisons involved >2 groups. A p-value <0.05 was consid￾ered significant.
Results
Clinical Characteristics and Measurements Before BVP
There were no significant differences in the mean age,
gender, NYHA functional class, cause of heart failure, num￾ber of hospitalizations for heart failure prior to BVP, elec￾trocardiographic indices, or echocardiographic measure￾ments between the 2 groups before BVP (Table 1).
Clinical Course and Measurements After BVP
During the mean follow-up period after undergoing
BVP, the 5 patients making up the nonresponder group had
no change in their NYHA functional class, and all of them
had to be re-hospitalized for worsening heart failure (aver￾age number of re-hospitalizations: 1.8±0.8; range: 1–3), and
1 patient died of heart failure. In contrast, the 12 patients
making up the responder group had an improvement in
their NYHA functional class to I or II, and none of them
was re-hospitalized.
There were no significant differences in the LVEDd,
LVESd or LV ejection fraction between the 2 groups
before or shortly after BVP (Fig 3A,B). In both groups, the
LVEDd, LVESd and the LV ejection fraction also did not
change significantly after BVP (Fig 3A,B). The QRS dura￾tion was significantly shorter after BVP in the responder
group (p<0.01), but did not change in the nonresponder
group (Fig 3C). However, no significant difference was
observed in the QRS duration before BVP (Table 1) or the
% shortening of the QRS duration after BVP (responders:
27±11%; nonresponders: 20±5%; p=0.26) between the 2
groups.
Intraventricular Conduction Delay in the LV Before and 
After BVP
Before receiving BVP, the intraventricular conduction
delay in the LV was greater in the responder group (126±
103 ms) than in the nonresponder group (36±20 ms; Fig 4).
However, after BVP, it did not differ between the 2 groups
(responder group, 44±40 ms; nonresponder group, 44±
19 ms). The LV intraventricular conduction delay signifi￾cantly improved in the responder group (p<0.01), but did
not improve in the nonresponder group (Fig 4).
LV Strain and Coefficient of Variation Before and After 
BVP
The LV-strain significantly improved in the responder
group, but deteriorated in the nonresponder group (p<0.05;
Fig 5A). Improvement in the LV-strain was observed more
often in the responder group (92%) than in the nonrespon￾der group (20%; p<0.05). The CV-strain or CV-time did
not differ between the 2 groups before or after BVP
(Fig 5B,C).

Changes in the Measurements Variables During a 
Follow-up
In 6 responders, although the LV diameter and EF mea￾sured 12±6 months after undergoing BVP had improved
more than at shortly after BVP, there was no significant
difference (Fig 6). The improvement in the LV intraventric￾ular conduction delay and LV-strain shortly after BVP was
unchanged at the time of follow-up (Fig 6); however, those
measurements did not change during the follow-up period
in 2 nonresponders. No significant difference was observed
in the CV-strain or CV-time in either group during the
follow-up period (Fig 6).
Discussion
Major Findings
The analysis of TDI and SDI in patients undergoing
BVP revealed the following findings: (1) the intraventricu￾lar conduction delay in the LV was significantly longer in
responders than in nonresponders, and after BVP it
improved in the responders; (2) LV-strain improved after
BVP in responders, but not in the nonresponders; (3) no
significant differences were found in the CV-strain and
CV-time between the responders and nonresponders before
or after BVP; (4) the intraventricular conduction delay and
LV-strain that improved shortly after the initiation of BVP

pacing lead might not result in improved regional LV
strain. It is also well known that the position of the LV
electrode also affects the response to BVP.18 Variable lead
positions and the underlying etiology, together with insuf￾ficient numbers for subgroup analysis, might explain the
absence of a consistent effect of BVP on regional LV strain,
resulting in no improvement in the CV-strain and CV-time
after BVP in the responders.
In the present study, there was also no significant differ￾ence in the LV diameter or EF between before and shortly
after initiating BVP in the responders or the nonresponders,
indicating that echocardiographic LV parameters cannot
predict long-term clinical improvement in patients under￾going BVP. These parameters improved during the follow￾up period in the responders, but without significant differ￾ences. In contrast, the LV intraventricular conduction delay
and LV-strain improved shortly after initiation of BVP, and
that improvement was maintained throughout the follow￾up period. Studies of acute BVP have shown that the most
significant improvements occur in the pulse pressure, by an
average of 18%,19 and in the stroke volume by 14%.20 How￾ever, the changes in the LV EF have been less pronounced,
and range from 1% to 4%.19,21 Therefore, the effects of BVP
on all the LV measurements, such as the LV diameter and
EF, might appear later than on the regional parameters (in￾traventricular conduction delay and LV-strain).
Study Limitations
First, the definition of responders might be subject to the
inherent inaccuracy of assessing NYHA class. However,
during the follow-up period, none of the responders was re￾hospitalized for heart failure whereas all the nonresponders
were. Therefore, our definition of the responders may be
acceptable for identifying a satisfactory clinical outcome
after BVP in patients with advanced heart failure.
Second, interventricular conduction delay,4,12 as well as
intraventricular conduction delay, has been demonstrated
in patients with advanced heart failure. BVP may also im￾prove the interventricular conduction delay, but because it
was not measured in this study, no conclusions about it
could be drawn.
Finally, the follow-up period after undergoing BVP was
relatively short, and our sample size was relatively small.
Not all variables could be measured in all the patients
during the follow-up period. Therefore, future studies are
needed to clarify and establish the effectiveness of TDI and
SDI in patients undergoing BVP.
Conclusions
TDI and SDI are useful for evaluating ventricular syn￾chrony and function in patients undergoing BVP. A high
intraventricular conduction delay in the LV before BVP
and decreased LV-strain shortly after BVP, irrespective of
the dispersion of the coefficient of variation of the LV strain
and time, may predict long-term clinical improvement.

These results indicate that a high intraventricular con￾duction delay in the LV and decreased strain shortly after
BVP, irrespective of the dispersion of CV-strain and 
CV-time, may predict long-term clinical improvement in
patients undergoing BVP, and that TDI and SDI are useful
for evaluating ventricular synchrony and function and
predicting long-term clinical improvement.
Role of TDI and SDI in Patients Undergoing BVP
BVP has become a promising new therapy for the treat￾ment of patients with end-stage heart failure and contractile
dyssynchrony caused by intraventricular conduction de￾lay.1,2,4 Better coordination of ventricular contractions may
be responsible for the beneficial effects of BVP, and precise
assessment of ventricular synchrony is crucial for evaluat￾ing and predicting the efficacy of BVP.1,4 In this regard, TDI
has emerged as a technique that allows accurate assessment
of the regional timing of mechanical events relative to the
phase of the cardiac cycle.4–12,14 Recent studies have re￾ported the usefulness of TDI for assessing and quantifying
LV dyssynchrony. Specifically, the intraventricular con￾duction delay in the LV can be measured by placing 2
sample volumes at the base of the septum and lateral wall,
and a delay ≥60 ms between the peak systolic velocity of
the septum and the lateral wall before BVP can predict
clinical improvement after BVP.10,11 In the present study,
the intraventricular conduction delay in the LV was greater
in the responders than the nonresponders before BVP, and
a significant improvement of the delay was found only in
the responders after BVP. Therefore, we hypothesize that
the presence of a greater intraventricular conduction delay
in the LV may predict the effectiveness of BVP and that
TDI is a useful technique for assessing the intraventricular
conduction delay.
Myocardial strain determined by Doppler echocardio￾graphy is a new, powerful method for quantifying regional
myocardial function and is less influenced by tethering
effects than TDI.14–16 Myocardial strain is a measure of the
regional deformation, and by definition, negative strain
reflects shortening whereas positive strain indicates elonga￾tion.16 In the present study, the LV-strain significantly
improved in the responders, but not in the nonresponders.
These findings indicate that BVP acutely improved re￾gional LV contractility in the responders, which may be a
consequence of improvement in the intraventricular con￾duction delay in the LV. On the other hand, CV-strain and
CV-time did not differ between the responders and non￾responders before or after BVP, which indicates that the
LV-strain, CV-strain or CV-time before BVP may not be
useful for identifying candidates or for predicting the long￾term clinical improvement in patients undergoing BVP,
and that a decreased LV-strain shortly after BVP poten￾tially may predict long-term clinical improvement.
In the present study, the LV-strain improved shortly
after BVP in the responder group, and its effect continued
throughout the follow-up period. However, the CV-strain
and CV-time did not improve either shortly after the BVP
or during the follow-up period in the responder group. A
previous study demonstrated that an improvement in the
LV-strain after BVP occurred unevenly in the LV,14 which
may be caused by ventricular pacing itself decreasing the
performance of the regions close to the electrode tip by
disrupting the normal electrical mechanical activation
sequence.17 Therefore, positioning the ROI at or near the
