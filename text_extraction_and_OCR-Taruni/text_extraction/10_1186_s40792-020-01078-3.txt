Abstract
Background: Lenvatinib is a novel tyrosine kinase inhibitor that exhibits an antitumor effect on hepatocellular carci￾noma (HCC). An established strategy that involves surgery and usage of lenvatinib for advanced HCC remains elusive.
Case presentation: A 58-year-old male patient with advanced HCC and untreated hepatitis B was referred to our 
hospital. The tumor at the right lobe was 10 cm in diameter with right portal vein thrombus. Because of the possible 
lung metastasis and concern about the remaining hepatic function after extended right hepatectomy, lenvatinib 
was initiated before surgery. After the confirmation of a sharp decrease of tumor markers during the 3-week len￾vatinib therapy, only a right portal vein transection was done leaving the enlargement of the left lobe for improved 
post-hepatectomy liver function while lenvatinib therapy was continued. The laparotomy revealed that the tumor 
was invading the right diaphragm. After 7 weeks of lenvatinib administration after right portal vein transection, 
an extended right hepatectomy with resection of the tumor-invaded diaphragm was successfully done. The lung 
nodules that were suspected as metastases had disappeared. The patient has been doing well without any sign of 
recurrence for 1 year.
Conclusion: The strategy involving the induction of lenvatinib to conversion hepatectomy including the portal vein 
transection was effective for advanced HCC.

Background
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading 
cause of death worldwide, with incidence continuing to 
increase [1, 2]. Due to the heterogeneity of HCC and the 
recent introduction of new agents like tyrosine kinase 
inhibitors, the current treatment options remain contro￾versial. Currently, surgical treatment of HCC is the most 
important means for long-term survival of HCC patients 
[3]. It is difficult to make a surgical choice for advanced 
HCC with portal vein invasion, diaphragmatic invasion 
and lung metastasis [4–6]. According to the AJCC 8th 
staging system, HCC with diaphragmatic invasion and 
invasion to the major branch of the portal vein are classi￾fied as advanced stage disease [7], and they are associated 
with a poor prognosis [4–6].
Lenvatinib (Eisai Europe Ltd. the United Kingdom) is 
an orally administered, multitargeted tyrosine kinase 
inhibitor that selectively inhibits vascular endothelial 
growth factor receptor (VEGFR) 1–3, fibroblast growth 
factor receptor (FGFR) 1–4, platelet-derived growth fac￾tor receptor alpha (PDGFRα), rearranged during trans￾fection (RET), and KIT [8–12]. Lenvatinib has been 
shown to be non-inferior to sorafenib in overall survival

in untreated advanced hepatocellular carcinoma [13]. 
A strategy that combines surgery with lenvatinib for 
advanced HCC has not yet been established. In this case, 
we report a case of hepatocellular carcinoma undergoing 
extended right hepatectomy after right portal vein tran￾section and lenvatinib therapy.
Case presentation
A 58-year-old male consulted with his primary doc￾tor regarding right abdominal pain. The patient was 
referred to our hospital with suspicion of HCC after 
conventional computed tomography (CT). Contrast￾enhanced abdominal CT revealed an approximately 
10×7×7 cm-sized tumor showing early enhancement 
and later washout with portal vein invasion in the right 
hepatic lobe (Fig. 1). Chest CT showed pulmonary nod￾ules in the right lower lobe of the lung, and lung metas￾tasis were considered (Fig. 2). Gadoxetic acid-enhanced 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a tumor 
with heterogenous enhancement on early phase and 
washout during portal vein phase (data not shown). 
Laboratory examination showed slight hepatic dys￾function; aspartate transaminase was 57  IU/L (normal 
13–30), alanine transaminase was 57  IU/mL (normal 
10–42), alkaline phosphatase was 356  IU/mL (normal 
106–322), serum albumin level was 4.3  g/dL (normal 
4.1–5.1), total bilirubin was 0.75  mg/dL, prothrom￾bin time-international normalized ratio (PT-INR) was 
1.02 (normal 0.85–1.15), and the ICG retention rate at 
15 min was 10.2% (normal ≤ 10%). Serology for hepati￾tis virus showed that the hepatitis B surface antigen was 
positive, anti-hepatitis C antibody was negative, and 
the hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA was found to be 1.3 
Log IU/mL. The levels of tumor markers before initial 
treatment were high; alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level was 
74.4 ng/mL (normal ≤ 13.4) and protein induced by the

absence of vitamin K or antagonist-II (PIVKA-II) was 
1204.58 mAU/mL (normal ≤ 40).
Considering the lung metastasis and the large right lobe 
tumor invading the right portal vein, chemotherapy was 
selected over primary surgery. Lenvatinib (12  mg/day) 
was applied for two weeks with an anti-HB agent (teno￾fovir alafenamide). Re-evaluation with contrast-enhanced 
CT after 2  weeks of lenvatinib administration showed 
tumor necrosis, the reduction of tumor vascularity, slight 
shrinkage of pulmonary nodules, and a little extension of 
portal vein invasion (Figs. 2, 3). Grade 2 hypertension was 
observed 7 days after the initiation of lenvatinib therapy. 
Levels of AFP and PIVKA-II sharply decreased (Fig.  4). 
From the findings of the portal vein invasion, we were 
concerned about the possible extension of the invasion 
to the contralateral branch and then loss of the chance 
of hepatectomy. Therefore, we decided to do portal vein 
transection and continue further lenvatinib therapy after 
that. Even at this moment, the estimated liver remnant 
volume was not enough (estimated liver remnant volume: 
482 mL, 40.3% of total liver volume), and we were reluc￾tant to do an extended right hepatectomy. He underwent 
a right portal vein transection after 1-week withdrawal 
from lenvatinib intending for the enlargement of the left 
lobe while more lenvatinib therapy were added (Fig.  5). 
The laparotomy revealed invasion to the right diaphragm. 
Enhanced abdominal CT showed left lobe hypertrophy 
and progression of tumor necrosis 1  month after the 
transection of the right portal vein (Fig.  3). Estimated 
liver remnant volume after extended right hepatectomy 
was 42.1% of total liver volume. Although estimated liver 
volume showed only a slight increase, we decided to per￾form the operation not to lose the chance of conversion 
hepatectomy. He underwent an extended right hepatec￾tomy with partial resection of the left medial segment 
and a part of the right diaphragm 2  months after the 
initial right portal vein transection (Fig. 5). The resected 
tumor was 5.2×3.6  cm in size, and the pathological 
diagnosis was moderately differentiated hepatocellu￾lar carcinoma (pT4pN0M0 pStage IVA, vp3, vv0, b0, p0 
UICC 8th) (Fig. 6). Intraoperative irrigation cytology was 
negative, and the resected diaphragm and tumor of right 
portal vein showed necrotic changes of the carcinoma as 
well as the absence of viable carcinoma. Non-cancerous 
liver tissues were noted to be A1F2 based on New Inuy￾ama Classification [9]. The level of AFP and PIVKA￾II returned to normal values after the hepatectomy. 
Although lenvatinib was resumed 1 month after the sec￾ond operation, he developed grade 2 thrombocytopenia 
2  weeks after resumption. This adverse event prompted 
the halting of lenvatinib administration 1  week after its 
reduction (Fig. 4). Platelet count recovered immediately

after halting of lenvatinib. Even after discontinuation of 
lenvatinib, AFP and PIVKA-II remained within the nor￾mal range (Fig. 4). Chest CT showed a decrease in size of 
the nodules after 3 months (Fig. 2) and subsequent disap￾pearance 6 months (data not shown) after hepatectomy. 
At 9 months after the hepatectomy and 1 year after diag￾nosis, the patient is doing well with no tumor recurrence.
Discussion
In this case, the patient with HCC showed portal vein 
invasion (vp3), diaphragmatic invasion, and suspected 
lung metastasis. Hypertrophy of the future liver rem￾nant by right portal vein transection while continuing 
lenvatinib therapy was considered to be a strong pos￾sibility. Finally, the patient was considered a viable

candidate to undergo curative conversion hepatectomy. 
Lung metastasis had been the target of additional 
resection after hepatectomy, but they fortunately disap￾peared in the postoperative CT. There are some reports 
about conversion hepatectomy for advanced hepatocel￾lular carcinoma after lenvatinib therapy [10–16]. Sato 
et  al. and Tomonari et  al. reported conversion hepa￾tectomy for HCC after transarterial chemoemboliza￾tion (TACE) and lenvatinib therapy [10, 11]. Matsuki 
et  al. reported a complete pathological response in 
conversion hepatectomy from lenvatinib treatment for 
advanced hepatocellular carcinoma [12]. Chen et  al. 
reported conversion hepatectomy after lenvatinib ther￾apy in combination with nivolumab [13]. The patients 
in these reports and our patient underwent conver￾sion hepatectomy while the lenvatinib had effect on 
HCC. This suggests that surgery should be tried while 
lenvatinib remains effective for control of the tumor 
growth. Tumor marker like AFP or PIVKA-II would 
be indicators for the effectiveness of the drug. In fact, 
it is difficult to expect the timing of the re-increase of 
the markers. When the findings of the tumor are sup￾pressed in the imaging studies for safer and complete 
resection while the tumor markers remain suppressed, 
it will be the good timing to concert to hepatectomy. 
Therefore, we need to follow-up the patient carefully 
without missing timing of safe surgical treatment. In 
the borderline HCC patient, there is a risk to lose the 
chance of hepatectomy if the lenvatinib is not effective. 
In addition, there is a risk of poor healing of the wound 
in the following surgery [17].
Among HCC patients, about 6% patients were initially 
diagnosed with lung metastasis. Only 2.1% among these 
patients with lung metastasis received surgery [6]. There￾fore, the reports were limited about the hepatectomy for 
primary HCC with synchronous lung metastasis. There 
are some reports that surgical treatment could achieve 
survival in selected patients [6, 18]. Surgical treatment in

combination with lenvatinib therapy has a possibility to 
improve prognosis of HCC patients with lung metastasis.
According to pathological examination, although tumor 
showed broad necrosis, viable carcinoma still remained 
in the resected liver in this case. Because resected dia￾phragm and tumor of right portal vein did not have via￾ble carcinoma, the patient showed good prognosis after 
the hepatectomy. Yamauchi et  al. reported that tumor 
fibroblast growth receptor 4 (FGFR4) level before treat￾ment was a predictor of response to lenvatinib [19]. If 
we performed a biopsy of the tumor at right portal vein 
transection operation, we might be able to evaluate the 
FGFR4 level of the tumor. FGFR4 immunohistochemis￾try in pretreatment tumor has a possibility to predict the 
response to lenvatinib therapy.
Recently, there have been reports that associating liver 
partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy 
(ALPPS) can also be performed for patients with HCC 
[20], which may also be applied for this case as well. 
However, we decided to transect the portal vein alone 
instead because we were concerned about the safety of 
ALPPS. It has been reported that future liver remnant 
volume hypertrophy takes an extended amount of time 
by portal vein dissection or embolism only. In actuality, 
this took 2 months in this case. However, in this case, this 
waiting time does not matter as the time was effectively 
used for lenvatinib administration.
Conclusion
The treatment strategy from induction of lenvatinib to 
conversion hepatectomy including the portal vein tran￾section was effective for a case of advanced hepatocellu￾lar carcinoma.
