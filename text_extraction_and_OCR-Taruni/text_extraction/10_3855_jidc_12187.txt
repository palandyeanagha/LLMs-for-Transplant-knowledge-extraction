Abstract
Obstructive jaundice caused by tuberculosis lymphadenitis is a rare condition. It can mimic clinical and radiological findings of hepatobiliary 
malignancies. The authors report a 24-year-old male patient who presented with abdominal pain, fever and jaundice for the last two weeks. It 
was found that cholestasis enzymes were increased by 2-3 fold and direct bilirubin was 6.13 mg/dL. Imaging studies revealed conglomerated 
lymph nodes with some cavitary lesions and dilated intrahepatic biliary canal secondary to compression by the lymph nodes. Tuberculosis was 
found to be positive in the polymerase chain reaction analysis of the aspirate that was obtained in the guidance of imaging studies. M. 
tuberculosis complex was isolated from mycobacterial culture. Anti-tuberculosis treatment was initiated. Clinical, laboratory and radiological 
findings completely resolved by medical therapy alone. Tuberculosis lymphadenitis should be kept in mind in cases presenting with obstructive 
jaundice in endemic areas and interventional diagnostic techniques should be preferred in eligible patients. 
Key words: Tuberculosis lymphadenitis; obstructive jaundice; radiological findings; interventional diagnostic techniques.

Introduction
Abdominal tuberculosis is rare and comprises 3.5-
4% of all extra-pulmonary tuberculosis cases. 
Abdominal tuberculosis is generally seen in 4 forms: 
tuberculosis lymphadenitis (TLAP), peritoneal 
tuberculosis, gastrointestinal tuberculosis and visceral 
tuberculosis involving solid organs. In general, patients 
present with a combination of these forms [1-4]. 
Obstructive jaundice secondary to tuberculosis can 
occur due to inflammatory stricture of the main biliary 
duct, compression by TLAP, enlargement of pancreas 
head due to tuberculosis, and retroperitoneal abscess of 
tuberculosis [5]. TLAP is most commonly seen form of 
abdominal tuberculosis and it generally follow drainage 
pathway of involved organs; however, it may involve 
any lymph node. Most commonly seen tuberculosis 
lymphadenopathies are mesenteric nodes, omental 
nodes, those at porta hepatis, those along celiac axes 
and those localized at peripancreatic area [6]. 
Here, we discussed a patient presented with 
obstructive jaundice caused by TLAP and diagnosed by 
interventional radiology methods, resulting in complete 
recovery with early medical treatment.
Case presentation
A 24-year old man presented to our hospital with 
new-onset jaundice. He had abdominal pain and night 
sweating for the past one month. Lasting 13 days fever 
was occur. The patient had no history of chronic 
disease. No alcohol consumption or smoking. With no 
family history. The patient was admitted for further 
evaluation. 
Physical examination
The patient had icteric appearance. There was 
tenderness at right upper quadrant with negative 
Murphy sign. There were inguinal and axillary 
lymphadenopathies < 1cm in size. 
Laboratory evaluations
Hemoglobin, 10.5 mg/dL; platelet count, 
387,000/µL; leukocyte count, 14,600/ µL; serum total

bilirubin, 4.77 mg/dL; direct bilirubin, 3.81 mg/dL; 
serum AST, 86 IU/Lt; serum ALT, 112 U/Lt; AST, 137 
U/Lt; ALP, 464 U/Lt; and GGT, 534 U/Lt. Other 
biochemical parameters were within normal range 
(Table 1). Serology revealed no abnormal finding: anti 
Hbc IgM (-); anti HIV (-); anti CMV IgM (-); anti HAV 
IgM (-); and Brucella agglutination (-).
Radiological evaluation
On hepatobiliary sonography, gallbladder appeared 
as contracted with wall thickness of 4 mm and dilated 
intrahepatic biliary duct. Common bile duct was 
measured as 11 mm and there was a stone (9 mm in size 
at proximal. Multiple lymphadenopathies were detected 
at porta hepatis as largest being 27×15 mm in size. On 
abdominal CT scan with contrast enhancement, a 
lobulated collection area with septa (55×40 mm in size) 
was detected in hepatic segment 4 and there were fluid 
and small lymph nodes at hepatic hilus and 
peripancreatic area (Figure 1). On MRCP, 
conglomerated lymphadenopathies with some cavitary 
lesions (largest being 5 cm in size) were detected at 
portal hilus, celiac axis and para-aortocaval area with 
dilated intrahepatic biliary duct secondary to 
compression by lymphadenopathy and collapsed 
gallbladder. Because malignancy was suspected, 18-
fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography 
(18F-FDG PET) was taken, a mass lesion with necrotic 
centre and intensive hyper-metabolism at peripheral 
areas in the junction of hepatic segments 2 and 3 in 
addition to multiple hyper-metabolic 
lymphadenopathies at mediastinum, bilateral 
supraclavicular lymphatic area and abdomen were 
detected (Figure 2).

Microbiological and histopathological examinations
An aspirate sample was obtained from hepatic 
lesion under imaging guidance. The aspirate sample 
was positive for tuberculosis PCR and M. tuberculosis 
complex growth was detected in mycobacterium 
culture.
Treatment
The patient was diagnosed with obstructive 
jaundice secondary to TLAP. Thus, anti-tuberculosis 
treatment was initiated. In the immunohistochemical 
evaluation of aspirate, no pathological finding was 
detected other than neutrophil and lymphocyte over the 
necrotic ground. Within 2 months, total bilirubin, direct 
bilirubin, ALP and GGT were regressed to 0.6 mg/dL, 
0,4 mg/dL, 46 IU/Lt and 23 IU/Lt, respectively. The 
anti-tuberculosis treatment was maintained for 9 
months and abscess formation disappeared on 
sonography. The patient is being followed without 
treatment.
Discussion
Obstructive jaundice caused by TLAP, a subtype of 
abdominal tuberculosis, mostly results from mechanical 
obstruction of the biliary duct by lymph nodes or mass 
lesions [2]. Here, we discussed a patient with abdominal 
tuberculosis who presented with malignancy-like 
clinical and radiological findings and found to have 
multiple tuberculosis lymphadenopathies at portal areas 
and diagnosed by interventional radiology methods. In 
the assessment for other subtypes of abdominal 
tuberculosis, no finding of intestinal tuberculosis was 
detected in upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopic 
examination in our case. In this case, multiple 
lymphadenopathies were observed in all above￾mentioned areas as largest being at portal area. 
Obstructive jaundice secondary to tuberculosis can 
occur due to inflammatory stricture of main biliary 
duct, compression by TLAP, enlargement of pancreas 
head due to tuberculosis and retroperitoneal abscess of 
tuberculosis. Pericholedocal tuberculous lymphadenitis 
in Korea showed a 81.3% male preponderance [7]. It 
rarely occurs due to rupture of tuberculosis granuloma 
to biliary ducts, direct involvement of biliary epithelium 
and pericholangitis [7]. In addition, there are reports of 
cases presented with obstructive jaundice caused by 
paradoxical reaction during or after treatment in the 
literature [8]. In our case, no findings of stricture in 
biliary duct, abnormality in pancreas and 
retroperitoneal abscess on imaging studies. Some of the 
reported cases were treated by surgery with anti-TB 
medication and some other cases were treated by anti￾TB medication alone or anti-TB medication with 
endoscopic nasobiliary drainage or prednisolone [5,9-
12].
Although clinical, laboratory, endoscopic and 
radiological sings as well as bacteriological findings are 
not gold standard for diagnosis of abdominal 
tuberculosis, the diagnosis is generally made by 
radiological and histopathological studies [3]. The 
value of radiological studies is limited in the diagnosis 
of abdominal tuberculosis. Although sonography is not 
efficient for evaluation of lymph nodes, it can 
effectively identify dilatation in intrahepatic and 
extrahepatic biliary ducts. The CT scan can identify 
ascites and lymphadenopathy but these are not specific. 
The CT scan can be useful to assess treatment response 
as rated by lymph node sizes. Additional MRI findings 
can be an alternative modality in the differential 
diagnosis of TLAP. The role of (18F)-fluoro-2-
deoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission 
tomography (PET) has not been clarified yet in 
tuberculosis and other inflammatory diseases. The 18F￾FDG PET has been used to detect tuberculosis 
granuloma and assess disease activity and the extent of 
disease. There are ongoing efforts to distinguish benign 
from malignant lesions by 18F-FDG PET without 
encouraging results. Active tuberculosis is associated 
with 18-F-FDG uptake in both pulmonary and extra￾pulmonary lesions. Thus, 18F-FDG PET is particularly 
useful in the detection of extra-pulmonary lesions since 
tissue or fluid sampling can be impossible or requires 
invasive procedures [13,14]. 
In our case, 18F-FDG PET scan was ordered as 
patient had presentation compatible with malignancy. 
However, 18F-FDG PET scan did not exclude 
malignancy in our case. The mass lesion with necrotic 
centre and intensive hyper-metabolism at peripheral 
areas in the junction of hepatic segments 2 and 3 was 
striking in our case. The foci was guiding for biopsy. 
TLAP often causes clinical and radiological finding 
which may be confused with hepatobiliary 
malignancies [15]. In most cases, diagnosis cannot be 
made before diagnostic laparotomy; thus, patients 
generally undergo unnecessary evaluations and 
explorative laparotomy [7,16]. In recent years, 
interventional diagnostic techniques have become more 
accessible; thus, rather than laparotomy, such methods 
are being used in eligible patients. US- or CT-guided 
fine-needle aspiration is useful to establish diagnosis 
[17]. In the literature, a similar case was presented by 
Al Umari R et al. [18]. However, in that case, the 
diagnosis was made by observing granulomatous 
inflammatory process in the histopathological

examination of lymph node samples from porta hepatis 
via laparoscopy. Culture tests and PCR did not provide 
definitive evidence. In our case, the definitive diagnosis 
was made by culture test and PCR analysis of aspirate 
obtained from hepatic lesion under CT guidance.
Conclusion
Obstructive jaundice secondary to TLAP should be 
kept in mind in endemic areas for tuberculosis although 
it is a rare entity. Tuberculosis should also be kept in 
mind in radiological studies. Interventional diagnostic 
techniques in appropriate conditions may prevent 
unnecessary burden of surgery and timely treatment can 
be provided by early diagnosis.
