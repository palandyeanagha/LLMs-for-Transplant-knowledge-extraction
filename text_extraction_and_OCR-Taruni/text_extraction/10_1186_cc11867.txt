Introduction
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was fi rst 
described in 1967 [1], and represents a common clinical 
problem in ICU patients. Th e syndrome is associated 
with a short-term mortality of approximately 45% [2] as 
well as signifi cant long-term morbidity [3]. Despite being 
both a major clinical problem and a focus of research for 
the critical care community, ARDS remains diffi cult to 
defi ne and a source of considerable controversy [4-7].
Using the 1994 American–European consensus criteria, 
ARDS was defi ned by widespread pulmonary infi ltrates 
on chest radiograph, hypoxaemia, and the absence of 
elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure or other 
evidence of left atrial hypertension [8]. Th e new Berlin 
Defi nition of ARDS categorises ARDS as mild, moderate 
or severe, and was designed to address a number of issues 
that had become apparent with the previous defi nition 
(Table 1) [9].
ARDS represents a complex response to local and 
systemic infl ammatory factors. Regardless of the under￾lying insult, the pathophysiological correlate of ARDS – 
diff use alveolar damage – involves neutrophil activation 
and endothelial injury, leading to noncardiogenic pulmo￾nary oedema and atelectasis [10]. Studies using computed 
tomography have demonstrated that, in contrast to chest 
radiograph appearances, the distribution of disease is 
heterogeneous with atelectatic-dependent regions and 
relatively well-aerated ‘baby lungs’ in nondependent areas 
[11,12]. Recognition of the heterogeneity of disease 
distri bution has led to the concept of recruitable lung 
regions and the need to deliver lower than historical tidal 
volumes to avoid overdistension of the baby lung.
Th e main diff erential diagnoses for ARDS are cardio￾genic pulmonary oedema, atypical infections, and diseases 
such as cryptogenic organising pneumonia, acute eosino￾philic pneumonia, and acute interstitial pneumonitis. 
While mimicking conditions such as cryptogenic organis￾ing pneumonia may produce an indistinguishable clinical 
picture, they are much less common than ARDS. [9] An 
important point to recognise is that ARDS is a clinical 
syndrome with heterogeneous underlying pathological 
processes rather than a discrete diagnostic entity. Condi￾tions associated with the onset of ARDS are diverse and 
are often classifi ed as extrapulmonary (examples include 
sepsis, trauma, burns and pancreatitis) or pulmonary, 
such as pneumonia, pulmonary contusion or aspiration 
of gastric contents. Addressing the underlying condition 
in a timely fashion is essential  – for example, with 
Abstract
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a 
potentially devastating form of acute infl ammatory 
lung injury with a high short-term mortality rate 
and signifi cant long-term consequences among 
survivors. Supportive care, principally with mechanical 
ventilation, remains the cornerstone of therapy – 
although the goals of this support have changed in 
recent years – from maintaining normal physiological 
parameters to avoiding ventilator-induced lung injury 
while providing adequate gas exchange. In this article 
we discuss the current evidence base for ventilatory 
support and adjunctive therapies in patients with 
ARDS. Key components of such a strategy include 
avoiding lung overdistension by limiting tidal volumes 
and airway pressures, and the use of positive end￾expiratory pressure with or without lung recruitment 
manoeuvres in patients with severe ARDS. Adjunctive 
therapies discussed include pharmacologic techniques 
(for example, vasodilators, diuretics, neuromuscular 
blockade) and nonpharmacologic techniques (for 
example, prone position, alternative modes of 
ventilation).

antibiotics and source control for sepsis – in addition to 
the provision of supportive care.
Th e majority of patients with ARDS will require 
invasive mechanical ventilation, although the successful 
use of non-invasive ventilation has also been described 
[13]. ARDS may resolve with supportive treatment, heal 
with interstitial fi brosis, or contribute to systemic 
infl ammation and death. We review current evidence￾based practices for invasive ventilation and discuss 
adjunctive therapies for ARDS.
Clinical ventilator management
Goals of mechanical ventilation
Th e goals of mechanical ventilation for ARDS are to 
minimise iatrogenic lung injury while providing accep￾table oxygenation and carbon dioxide clearance.
While the contribution of ventilator-induced lung 
injury (VILI) to ARDS has not been fully elucidated, it is 
clear from animal models that mechanical ventilation can 
cause pathologic changes consistent with ARDS in the 
absence of other insults [14]. Mechanisms of VILI include 
alveolar overdistension (volutrauma), repetitive alveolar 
opening and closure (atelectrauma), oxygen toxicity, and 
biotrauma, the pulmonary and systemic response to 
alveolar overdistension that may exacerbate lung infl am￾ma tion and contribute to multiple organ dysfunction 
[15,16]. Eff orts to minimise VILI are focused on the use 
of low tidal volume ventilation to prevent volutrauma, 
the use of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) to 
reduce alveolar collapse, and minimisation of exposure to 
potentially harmful oxygen concentrations. Specifi c 
therapies targeted at the immune response remain 
experimental to date.
Acceptable parameters for the partial pressure of 
arterial oxygen (PaO2
) and the partial pressure of arterial 
carbon dioxide are diffi cult to defi ne. Although PaO2
 of 
55 to 80  mmHg is considered the target range in many 
studies, more profound hypoxaemia may be well toler￾ated, as evidenced by the relatively rare occurrence of 
death due to refractory hypoxaemia in ARDS [17], the 
occurrence of well-tolerated profound hypoxaemia (aver￾age of 24.6  mmHg or 3.28  kPa) in climbers on Everest 
[18], and the reported survival of patients with ARDS and 
PaO2
 <30  mmHg (4  kPa) [19]. However, caution should 
be exercised in view of the reported correlation between 
cognitive defects in survivors of ARDS and duration of 
arterial oxygen saturation <90% [20].
Inhalation of high concentrations of oxygen (fraction of 
inspired oxygen (FiO2
) ≥0.8) is associated with progres￾sive alveolar damage and death in animal studies [21]. In 
healthy human volunteers exposed to high concentrations 
of oxygen, tracheobronchitis develops after several hours 
[22] and prolonged exposure is associated with decreased 
vital capacity [23], increased dead space, increased pro￾duc tion of reactive oxygen species, and biochemical 
markers of alveolar-capillary leak [24]. In a small series of 
patients with ARDS, ventilation with 100% oxygen was 
associated with increased intrapulmonary shunt, attri￾buted to nitrogen reabsorption and atelectasis [25]. 
Compared with other aspects of VILI, however, relatively 
little work has been done on oxygen toxicity in adults 
with ARDS, and the threshold for toxicity, particularly in 
the setting of an open lung strategy and low tidal volume 
ventilation, is unknown. Based on the limited available 
data, our practice is to aim for FiO2
 ≤0.6 and to consider 
adjunctive therapies where this cannot be achieved by 
recruitment manoeuvres and higher PEEP alone.
Since low tidal volumes are protective despite 
resulting in higher partial pressure of arterial carbon 
dioxide levels [26], there has been increasing acceptance 
of hyper capnia as being harmless or even potentially 
bene fi cial by virtue of rightward shift of the oxyhaemo￾globin dissociation curve, systemic and microcirculatory 
vasodilatation, and inhibitory eff ects on neutrophils and 
other infl ammatory cells [27]. Th e optimal partial 
pressure of arterial carbon dioxide level for patients 
with ARDS is not clear, but mean levels of 66.5 mmHg 
(8.87  kPa) and pH  7.23 appear safe [28,29] in the 
absence of a clear contraindication to hypercapnia, such 
as raised intracranial pressure.

Ventilation
Following numerous animal and observational human 
studies, the landmark ARDS Network study provided 
clear evidence of large mortality benefi t when patients 
with ARDS were ventilated with a lung-protective strategy 
aimed at avoidance of alveolar overdistension using tidal 
volumes of 6 ml/kg predicted body weight (Box 1) with 
plateau pressures ≤30  cmH2
O [26]. Adjustment of the 
ventilator rate was used to target a normal pH, with a 
mean respiratory rate of 30  breaths/minute in the low 
tidal volume arm. Tidal volumes in patients with ARDS 
should therefore be in the order of 6  ml/kg predicted 
body weight with plateau pressures <30 cmH2
O, accept￾ing pH as low as 7.15 to achieve these targets.
Many ventilation modes have been employed in ARDS. 
To add to the confusion, manufacturers often use diff er￾ent names for similar modes. One must choose between 
spontaneous breathing modes with partial ventilatory 
support, or controlled modes; either a pressure￾controlled mode in which tidal volume is the dependent 
variable, or a volume-controlled mode in which peak 
pressure may vary.
Spontaneous breathing with partial ventilatory support 
has been postulated to allow for better patient–ventilator 
synchrony, lower sedation requirements, and better 
preser vation of diaphragmatic function with earlier 
libera tion from mechanical ventilation. Data supporting 
this hypothesis, however, are currently very limited. A 
recent systematic review [30] identifi ed only two small 
randomised controlled trials (RCTs) addressing this 
question, both of which used airway pressure release 
ventilation as the spontaneous breathing mode. One of 
these trials suggested improved oxygenation and in￾creased number of ventilator-free days [31], but concerns 
exist that these may have been driven largely by 
decrements in the control group; meanwhile, the other 
trial showed no eff ect on clinical outcomes [32]. Th e 
main disadvantage of spontaneous breathing is the 
potential for the patient to generate high transpulmonary 
pressures and tidal volumes; suppression of this often 
requires the use of high doses of sedation with or without 
muscle relaxants. Balancing the risks between increasing 
sedation in order to provide lung protection and allowing 
spontaneous ventilation in a more awake patient is often 
a diffi cult clinical problem with limited applicable 
evidence. Our practice is to aim for spontaneous breath￾ing with partial ventilatory support, frequently using 
pressure support ventilation in patients with mild to 
moderate ARDS, while in moderate to severe ARDS 
patients we use sedation and muscle relaxants as 
necessary to achieve lung-protective ventilation.
Proponents of pressure-controlled ventilation argue 
that this allows for better patient–ventilator synchrony, 
that the decelerating fl ow pattern allows better 
distri bution of inspired gases, and that high 
transpulmonary pressures are more easily avoided [33]. 
Conversely, volume-controlled ventilation allows safe 
tidal volumes to be delivered in a consistent pattern, thus 
avoiding alveolar overdistension [34]. Pressure-regulated 
volume control ventilation aims to combine the 
advantages of both approaches, but may be problematic 
when patients are making variable or intermittent 
inspiratory eff orts. Th ere is no evidence of benefi t for any 
one mode, the important point being to ensure both safe 
tidal volumes (6  ml/kg predicted body weight) and 
plateau pressures (≤30  cmH2
O) regardless of the mode 
used.
Various less conventional modes (for example, propor￾tional assist ventilation, neurally adjusted ventilatory 
assist, and so forth) have so far not been demonstrated to 
off er signifi cant benefi ts over conventional modes of 
ventilation in ARDS.
Alveolar recruitment and positive end-expiratory pressure
Higher levels of PEEP with or without recruitment 
manoeuvres are often used to improve oxygenation. 
Using a transient increase in transpulmonary pressure, 
recruitment manoeuvres attempt to open previously 
atelec tatic alveoli. Th is increase in the size of the ARDS 
baby lung [12] allows distribution of inspired gas among 
greater numbers of lung units, leading to less over￾distension of individual alveoli and potentially less VILI 
[35]. Several methods have been described, the most 
commonly used of which is a sustained infl ation breath; 
for example, 40  cmH2
O for 40  seconds [35]. Another 
manoeuvre that appears to be gaining popularity is a 
step-wise increase in PEEP accompanied by low levels of 
pressure control ventilation [36,37]. Common complica￾tions of any recruitment manoeuvre include transient 
hypotension and desaturation, while pneumothorax and 
other manifestations of barotrauma have been reported 
and transient alveolar overdistension during the mano eu￾vre may paradoxically worsen VILI [35]. Recruitment 
man oeu vres are associated with an immediate 
improvement in oxygenation with variable sustainability, 
but have not been shown to improve clinically important 
outcomes [38,39]. Th ey may be most useful as a rescue 
therapy in refractory hypoxaemia or following deteriora￾tion in oxygenation attributable to worsening atelectasis.
Th e sustainability of improvements in oxygenation with 
recruitment manoeuvres may depend on the use of PEEP 
as a means of maintaining recruitment. In selecting a

PEEP level, one must consider both the target level (low, 
moderate, high) and the method for determining the 
actual numeric value of PEEP. In terms of target level, 
there is at least observational evidence to suggest that 
very low levels of PEEP (<5 cmH2
O) are associated with 
worse mortality [40]. Th e debate regarding targets of 
moderate versus higher levels of PEEP is informed by 
three recent large RCTs that maintained low tidal 
volumes in all patients [41-43]. While none of these trials 
individually showed a signifi cant mortality benefi t, when 
combined in an individual-patient meta-analysis the 
patients with moderate–severe ARDS (PaO2
/FiO2
 ≤200) 
had lower mortality and more ventilator-free days with 
higher levels of PEEP (approximately 15 cmH2
O on day 1) 
[44]. In contrast, patients with mild ARDS (PaO2
/FiO2
 = 
201 to 300) showed a nonsignifi cant trend towards worse 
outcomes with higher PEEP; no benefi t was seen in the 
overall population (see Figure 1) [44].
In terms of determining the exact level of PEEP for an 
individual patient within a targeted approach, several 
methods have been described. Th ese methods most 
commonly consist of using a PEEP/FiO2
 table in which 
PEEP is titrated to provide acceptable oxygenation 
[26,41,42], titrating PEEP to a maximal acceptable plateau 
pressure while maintaining a safe tidal volume [43], or a 
decremental PEEP approach where a recruitment man￾oeuvre is followed by titration of PEEP to the minimum 
required to prevent de-recruitment and atelectrauma 
[45]. Th is decremental approach is most easily achieved 
by a sustained infl ation breath or pressure control 
recruit ment manoeuvre, followed by a decremental 
reduc tion in PEEP until a deterioration in compliance or 
oxygenation occurs, followed by a further recruitment 
manoeuvre and setting the PEEP 2  cmH2
O above this 
point [35]. Th is method of identifying a point of de￾recruitment correlates well with that found on serial 
computed tomography imaging [46]. Similar results may 
be obtained regardless of the specifi c target used as a 
marker of lung opening [47].
An intriguing recent report describes setting PEEP 
guided by oesophageal pressures as a surrogate for 
pleural pressure [48]. Transpulmonary pressure is then 
calculated and the PEEP set to achieve a positive end￾expiratory transpulmonary pressure, with higher pressures 
used for higher FiO2
 requirements. In a small single￾centre RCT this approach led to improvements in 
oxygenation and even a suggestion of improved mortality 
[48]. Given the complexities involved in measuring and 
standardising oesophageal pressure measurements, and 
the preliminary nature of these fi ndings, we believe that 
confi rmation in the form of a larger multicentre RCT is 
required before this approach is used in the majority of 
ARDS patients. Other experimental methods of setting 
PEEP include titration to the minimum dead space 
fraction [49], optimal cardiac output, or transcutaneous 
oxygen tension [50], although none of these methods 
appears widely used in current clinical practice.
Our pragmatic approach is to use the lower ARDS 
Network PEEP/FiO2
 tables as a guide in most mecha ni￾cally ventilated patients [26], with adjustment according 
to clinical response and our impression of chest wall 
compliance (obesity, oedema, or intra-abdominal hyper￾tension may imply the need for higher PEEP to prevent 
gravitational alveolar collapse). In patients with moderate 
ARDS (PaO2
/FiO2
 = 101 to 200) we typically switch to a 
higher PEEP/FiO2
 table [41,42], and if oxygenation 
remains problematic in severe ARDS (PaO2
/FiO2
 <100) 
we often use recruitment manoeuvres followed by a 
decremental PEEP trial.
Th e inspiratory:expiratory ratio is generally set at a 
ratio of 1:2 as a default, but may be increased to 1:1 as 
needed in order to increase the mean alveolar pressure, 
to allow more time for fi lling of lung units with long time 
constants, and to increase alveolar recruitment. Th e main 
risk from this ratio increase is gas trapping, and therefore 
monitoring of the fl ow–time curve to ensure near￾cessation of fl ow prior to inhalation is essential. Inverse 
ratio ventila tion, with inspiratory:expiratory ratio >1:1, 
results in higher mean airway pressures and can improve 
oxygena tion but appears less useful than increasing 
PEEP  – and the associated intrinsic PEEP may worsen 
gas exchange, volutrauma, and haemodynamics [51,52].
Pharmacological adjuncts
Pulmonary vasodilators
Inhaled nitric oxide is a potent but extremely short￾acting pulmonary vasodilator that selectively improves 
perfusion to well-ventilated alveoli, reducing intrapulmo￾nary shunt and improving oxygenation. Despite improve￾ments in oxygenation, the use of inhaled nitric oxide is 
not associated with any mortality benefi t, is expensive, 
and requires a specialist delivery system [53,54]. A recent 
systematic review found a suggestion of increased renal 
failure in association with its use, although biologically 
plausible explanations for this remain speculative [53]. 
Our practice is to use inhaled nitric oxide in ARDS as 
rescue therapy for reversible, life-threatening hypoxae mia, 
usually as a starting dose of 5  ppm and titrating to a 
maximum of 20 ppm, with discontinuation if no signifi -
cant improvement in oxygenation is apparent after a 
short trial.
Inhaled prostacyclin has similar theoretical benefi ts to 
nitric oxide in terms of selective pulmonary vasodilata￾tion, but has been less extensively studied in the context 
of ARDS [55]. Small physiological studies suggest an 
equivalent eff ect on pulmonary artery pressures and oxy￾genation to inhaled nitric oxide, although none have been 
powered to compare clinically important endpoints

[55,56]. Evidence for prostacyclin use is confi ned to these 
small studies and case reports. Th e clinical relevance of 
theoretical side eff ects such as systemic vasodilatation 
and platelet dysfunction is unknown. Prostacyclin is 
considerably less expensive and does not require the 
same commercial delivery system as nitric oxide, but the 
nebuliser requires continual observation during 
prostacyclin delivery, and the technique remains an 
unproven rescue therapy for life-threatening hypoxaemia.
Fluid balance
Th e three factors involved in oedema formation are 
hydrostatic pressure, colloid osmotic pressure, and the 
capillary fi ltration coeffi cient. In the absence of eff ective 
methods to reduce pulmonary capillary leak (that is, the 
fi ltration coeffi cient), eff orts to reduce extravascular lung 
water in ARDS are centred on minimising hydrostatic 
pressure by avoiding fl uid overload, and potentially the 
use of albumin solutions to increase colloid osmotic 
pressure.
An association between positive fl uid balance and 
worse outcome in patients with ARDS has been demon￾strated in a number of studies [57,58]. Data from the 
ARDS Network Fluids and Catheter Th erapy Trial support 
the use of a conservative fl uid management strategy in 
ARDS, with the use of diuretics in haemodynamically 
stable patients to achieve an even fl uid balance associated 
with improved oxygenation and faster liberation from 
mechanical ventilation [59]. While a dry approach to 
patients with sepsis and particularly ARDS has tradi￾tionally been assumed to benefi t lungs at the expense of 
renal and other organ perfusion, a growing body of evi￾dence exists to the contrary. In ARDS patients enrolled in 
the Fluids and Catheter Th erapy Trial, for instance, 
conser vative fl uid management was associated with 
lower rates of acute kidney injury in ARDS patients once 
correction for changes in the volume of distribution of 
creatinine was used [60]. Th ese fi ndings of acute 
improve ments from the Fluids and Catheter Th erapy 
Trial need to be interpreted in light of a recent report 
showing potential for worse long-term cognitive function 
in a subset of the trial survivors [61].
In general, unnecessary fl uid administration should be 
minimised using small-volume fl uid boluses titrated to 
resolution of hypoperfusion states. Diuretics or ultra￾fi ltration should be employed to restore euvolaemia in 
haemodynamically stable patients who have received 
fl uid loading in the resuscitation phase of their illness. 
However, in some patients, particularly those with severe 
ARDS requiring high mean airway pressures for oxygena￾tion, hypovolaemia may exacerbate hypoxaemia by virtue 
of increased intrapulmonary shunt, and clinical benefi t 
may result from the careful administration of fl uid 
boluses.
Neuromuscular blockade
Neuromuscular blockers are used in ARDS to improve 
patient–ventilator synchrony, to facilitate lung-protective 
ventilation, and to improve chest wall compliance. Th ese 
blockers also reduce oxygen consumption by respiratory 
(and other skeletal) muscles, leading to an improved 
mixed venous saturation and in turn to an improved 
partial pressure of arterial oxygen, all other things being 
equal in most ARDS patients. In a recent large RCT,

course of moderate–severe ARDS (PaO2

<150  mmHg) resulted in a reduction in the duration of 
mechanical ventilation and mortality [62]. Concerns 
regarding the use of neuromuscular blockers relate 
primarily to the risk of critical illness myopathy [63,64], a 
concern that was not borne out in this study and which 
may have been overemphasised [65,66]. Aminosteroid 
muscle relaxants such as rocuronium may present a 
higher risk than benzylquinolinium compounds such as 
cisatracurium in this regard [67]. In this group of severe 
ARDS patients, almost all of whom will require heavy 
sedation to facilitate lung-protective ventilation and 
patient–venti lator synchrony, some benefi t of 
neuromuscular blockers may derive from a sedative￾sparing eff ect. Our current approach is to consider 
neuromuscular blockade for patients with severe ARDS 
in whom patient–ventilator asynchrony is thought to 
contribute to diffi culty in gas exchange or in achieving 
lung-protective ventilation.
Other pharmacological adjuncts
Based on the observation that hypoproteinaemia is a 
strong risk factor for ARDS [68], the use of albumin along 
with furosemide has been studied in two small phase II 
trials [69,70]. Albumin use was associated with improved 
oxygenation, diuresis and haemodynamics, and repre￾sents an approach in need of further evaluation.
Corticosteroids have been investigated extensively in 
ARDS. High-dose steroids used in the early stages of 
ARDS have no benefi t and may increase the rate of 
infectious complications [71,72]. One small randomised 
study suggested a survival benefi t in the late (fi bro pro￾lifera tive) phase of ARDS [73], but a larger study failed to 
replicate this benefi t despite showing improvements in 
physiological parameters [74]. Most recently, a trial of 
early, low-dose steroids in ARDS showed improvements 
in gas exchange without improvements in clinically 
signifi cant endpoints [75]. Overall, the data are unclear 
and thus steroids have yet to fi nd their place in the 
routine management of ARDS.
Other agents with a biological rationale but that have 
recently failed to demonstrate clinical utility in random￾ised trials include β-agonists (both nebulised and intra￾venous) [76,77] and omega-3 fatty acid supplements [78].
Nonpharmacological adjuncts
Prone positioning has a sound pathophysiologic basis 
and has been used for many years in the management of 
ARDS. Recruitment of dorsal lung regions where greater 
lung mass is located, displacement of the cardiac mass 
away from lung tissue, and more homogeneous distri￾bution of ventilation in the prone position are among the 
mechanisms postulated for the improved oxygenation 
that is consistently observed in studies of prone position￾ing in ARDS. Unfortunately, several large trials have 
demonstrated that although oxygenation generally im￾proves with prone positioning, this does not appear to 
result in a survival benefi t when all patients with ARDS 
are considered [79-83]. Two recent meta-analyses did, 
however, demonstrate an improvement in ICU mortality 
in patients with severe ARDS [84]. Th e benefi t appears to 
be greater when the prone position is maintained for 
longer (that is, 17 or 18 hours), and although signifi cant 
complications can develop (skin necrosis, dislodgement 
of catheters and tubes) these are not signifi cantly more 
frequent when prone positioning is used. Prone 
positioning should be considered as an option to improve 
oxygenation for patients in whom conventional measures 
have failed and for patients with severe ARDS (PaO2
/FiO2
<100).
Th e injurious eff ects and limitations of conventional 
ventilation have led to the development of a number of 
alternative modes of ventilation. Airway pressure release 
ventilation is a spontaneous breathing mode in which a 
high baseline pressure is released to a low level inter￾mittently (6 to 12 times/minute) to allow ventilation, with 
spontaneous breaths permitted throughout the cycle. 
Th is technique may result in improvements in lung 
recruitment, oxygenation, and patient–ventilator synch￾rony, although with the potential cost of alveolar 
overdistension. Although some early studies have been 
promising, no defi nite outcome benefi t has been demon￾strated to date for this mode of ventilation [31,32,85].
Neurally adjusted ventilatory assist utilises an oeso pha￾geal electrode to measure diaphragmatic electrical 
activity, delivering positive pressure proportionately. 
While potentially useful in patients who are diffi cult to 
manage with conventional ventilation due to asynchrony 
[86,87], no prospective outcome studies have been 
carried out in ARDS patients.
High-frequency oscillatory ventilation utilises rapidly 
cycling positive and negative pressure oscillations around 
a high mean airway pressure to deliver very small tidal 
volumes at high frequencies (5 to 15 Hz or 300 to 900 per 
minute). Th e mechanisms of gas fl ow and ventilation 
involved are complex, but high-frequency oscillatory 
ventilation appears to result in maintenance of lung 
recruitment as well as improvements in oxygenation and 
ventilation in ARDS patients refractory to conventional 
ventilation and is potentially less injurious to the lung 
[88]. At the current time, high-frequency oscillatory 
venti lation appears safe and appropriate as rescue 
therapy for patients with refractory hypoxemia [89]. 
Results are expected in the near future from at least two 
large clinical trials comparing high-frequency oscillatory 
ventilation with conventional ventilation in moderate–
severe ARDS patients.
Th e role of extracorporeal lung support in ARDS is

specialist centres. Th e most extensively studied form used 
in ARDS patients is venovenous extracorporeal membrane 
oxygenation (ECMO). A recent RCT of trans fer to an 
ECMO centre found a mortality benefi t when compared 
with conventional therapy [90]. However, this study has 
been criticised for confl ating ECMO treatment and 
regionalisation eff ects, and for a lack of well-documented 
protective ventilation in the control group. Even more 
recently the H1N1 infl uenza epidemic has highlighted the 
potential benefi ts of extracorporeal lung support [91,92]. 
Potential drawbacks of extracorporeal lung support 
include lack of widespread availability and the need for 
systemic anticoagulation. Transfer to an ECMO centre 
should be considered in patients with rever sible disease in 
whom lung-protective ventilation cannot provide 
acceptable gas exchange when other rescue measures have 
failed, and should be utilised early in the course of disease, 
before irreversible lung injury has occurred.
Future directions
Th ere remain a large number of unanswered questions in 
the management of ARDS. Th e role of nonconventional 
ventilatory techniques is currently under study, as are the 
utility of extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal in con￾junction with ultra-low tidal volume ventilation and the 
utility of ECMO for severe ARDS. Dependence on con￾ventional positive-pressure ventilation may decline if 
these new technologies fi nd a place.
Conclusion
Understanding mechanical ventilation as a potentially 
harmful yet life-saving intervention has led to the 
development of an approach that aims to minimise harm 
while providing acceptable gas exchange. Ventilation in 
ARDS should include the use of low tidal volumes, the 
avoidance of high plateau pressures, titration of PEEP to 
provide acceptable oxygenation, and avoidance of high 
inspired oxygen concentrations. Individualised targets 
for oxygenation and carbon dioxide clearance should be 
set, recognising the lack of harm associated with 
hypercapnia and the risk of harm associated with high 
inspired oxygen concentrations.
Useful rescue strategies when lung-protective ventila￾tion fails to provide acceptable gas exchange include 
recruitment manoeuvres and optimisation of PEEP, 
neuromuscular blockade, and prone positioning. Fluid 
overload must be avoided, and diuretics or ultrafi ltration 
should be used to achieve a negative fl uid balance in 
stable patients. Failure of these measures should lead to 
consideration of nonconventional modes of ventilation or 
the use of extracorporeal therapies in selected patients 
with reversible disease. In spite of all these measures, 
however, ARDS remains a diffi cult clinical problem and 
carries a high mortality – we still have work to do [2].
