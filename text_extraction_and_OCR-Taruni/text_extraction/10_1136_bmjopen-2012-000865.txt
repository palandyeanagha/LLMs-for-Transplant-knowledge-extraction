ABSTRACT
Objective: To investigate the impact in an aging
society of the 2011 Great East Japan earthquake on
hospitalisation for respiratory disease at the disaster
base hospital.
Design: Descriptive and cross-sectional study.
Setting: Emergency care in Japanese Red Cross
Ishinomaki Hospital, a regional disaster base hospital
in Miyagi, Japan.
Participants: 322 emergency patients who were
hospitalised for respiratory disease from 11 March to
9 May 2011, and 99 and 105 emergency patients who
were hospitalised in the corresponding periods in 2009
and 2010, respectively.
Main outcome measures: Description and
comparison of patient characteristics and disease
distribution in terms of age, time after the disaster and
activities of daily living (ADL).
Results: 1769 emergency patients were admitted to
our hospital during the study period (compared to 850
in 2009 and 1030 in 2010), among whom 322 were
hospitalised for respiratory disease (compared to 99 in
2009 and 105 in 2010). Pneumonia (n=190, 59.0%)
was the most frequent cause of admission for
pulmonary disease, followed by acute exacerbation of
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AE-COPD)
(n=53, 16.5%), asthma attacks (n=27, 8.4%) and
progression of lung cancer (n=22, 6.8%). Compared
with the corresponding periods in 2009 and 2010, the
increase in the absolute numbers of admissions was
highest for pneumonia, followed by AE-COPD and
asthma attacks. At hospitalisation, 195 patients were
‘dependent’ and 54 patients were ‘partially dependent’.
Respiratory admissions accompanied by deterioration
of ADL after the disaster were more frequent in elderly
and female patients.
Conclusions: After the Great East Japan Earthquake,
admissions for pneumonia and exacerbation of chronic
respiratory disease in the elderly increased at the
disaster base hospital.
INTRODUCTION
On 11 March 2011, at 14:46 h Japanese time,
the Pacific coast of Japan’s Tohoku (north￾eastern) region was struck by a huge earth￾quake (The Great East Japan Earthquake)
measuring 9.0 on the Richter scale.1 The
earthquake triggered a devastating tsunami
which destroyed many towns and villages
close to the sea. The epicentre was estimated
to be about 130 km east of Oshika Peninsula
in Miyagi Prefecture. Officially, over 19 000
ARTICLE SUMMARY
Article focus
▪ The Great East Japan Earthquake affected one of
the most rapidly aging societies in the world.
▪ We describe how the disaster affected respiratory
diseases in the worst affected area, which has
one of the highest ratios of elderly people in
Japan.
▪ The study provides lessons for use after natural
disasters in an aging society.
Key messages
▪ After the earthquake and tsunami, admissions
for pneumonia and exacerbation of chronic
respiratory disease increased among the elderly.
▪ Harsh conditions and poor activities of daily
living status after the disaster may be associated
with increased hospitalisation for respiratory dis￾eases in elderly people.
Strengths and limitations of this study
▪ We were able to obtain detailed patient data after
a disaster.
▪ We only studied hospitalised patients, but there
were also numerous outpatients, many of whom
died.

people were killed or are missing and there were more
than 550 000 refugees.2
Ishinomaki city, located on the Pacific coast of
Honshu Island, lost the most victims in the disaster, with
3280 people killed and 669 still missing. A huge number
of casualties, more than 10 000 patients in the first
30 days, were treated at Japanese Red Cross Ishinomaki
Hospital, a regional disaster base hospital in Ishinomaki
which preserved its hospital function during and after
the catastrophe.
Japan is one of the most rapidly aging societies in the
world. In 2010, 23% of Japanese citizens were aged 65
or over,3 while 26.6% of people living in Ishinomaki city
in the Tohoku region were aged 65 or over. Although
several reports showed a significant association between
age and death following the earthquake and tsunami,4–8
few reports have investigated the impact of a huge disas￾ter on the elderly in an aging society.9 10
As respiratory diseases are common in the elderly, investi￾gating the impact of the disaster on respiratory health will
help elucidate the problems of an aging society. Thus, we
carried out a retrospective descriptive and cross-sectional
analysis of the medical and epidemiological data of patients
requiring hospitalisation for respiratory disease after the
Great East Japan Earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
METHODS
This study was a retrospective descriptive and cross￾sectional analysis of data obtained from the medical
records at Japanese Red Cross Ishinomaki Hospital. We
reviewed the medical records of patients admitted to the
hospital for respiratory diseases during the first 60 days
after the Great East Japan Earthquake, when the hos￾pital only accepted emergency patients. We also reviewed
the medical records of patients who required unsched￾uled hospitalisation for respiratory disease in the corre￾sponding periods in 2009 and 2010.
Japanese Red Cross Ishinomaki Hospital has 402
inpatient beds and is located 4.5 km inland from the
Pacific. It serves approximately 220 000 people
(Ishinomaki City, Onagawa Town and Higashi-matsushima
City) and was designated a regional disaster base hospital.
It normally accepts most emergency respiratory patients in
the region because it has a respiratory department and
employs pulmonary specialists.
Information on date of admission, age, sex, diagnosis
and place of residence was extracted from the medical
records for the 2011 study period. We also investigated
activities of daily living (ADL) before the earthquake
and at hospitalisation. The number of unscheduled hos￾pitalisations during the corresponding periods in 2009
and 2010 were counted for comparison.
Pneumonia was defined as the presence of infiltrates
on chest radiograph together with one or more of the
following signs or symptoms: fever, cough, sputum pro￾duction, breathlessness, pleuritic chest pain or signs con￾sistent with pneumonia on auscultation.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and
bronchial asthma were determined according to spiro￾metric data, patient self-report or physician diagnosis
based on patient history, physical examination and radio￾logical findings. An acute exacerbation of COPD
(AE-COPD) was defined as an increase in or new onset
of more than one symptom of COPD (cough, sputum,
wheezing, dyspnoea or chest tightness) without pneumo￾nia or pneumothorax. An attack of asthma was defined
as wheeze or severe cough in asthma patients without
pneumonia. Progression of lung cancer was defined as a
requirement for admission for a lung cancer-associated
condition such as dehydration, respiratory failure or
uncontrolled pain. Obstructive pneumonia due to lung
cancer was considered to be progression of lung cancer.
Chest trauma and traumatopnea were deemed to be
chest injury rather than respiratory disease.
ADL was assessed based on information provided by the
patient, the patient’s family or the patient’s caregiver, and
the patient classified into one of three categories: ‘inde￾pendent’(living without particular support), ‘partially
dependent’ (unable to leave home without support),
‘dependent’ (spending the day in bed or in a wheelchair
and unable to move about independently). To investigate
the impact of the disaster on ADL, we defined as ‘origin￾ally dependent’ those who were dependent or partially
dependent before the disaster, and as ‘newly dependent’
those who became dependent or partially dependent after
the disaster.
Data analysis
All data were entered into a personal computer and ana￾lysed using Microsoft Excel software. Statistical analysis
was performed using JMP9 (SAS Institute, Cary, North
Carolina, USA). A missing value in a medical record was
treated as ‘unknown’. Results were given as means±SD
for numerical variables and as proportions for categor￾ical variables. To analyse sequential changes in the
effects of the disaster, we divided the 60 days of the study
period into six groups of 10-day bins. To investigate the
risk of hospitalisation for respiratory disease after the
earthquake and tsunami, we compared patient charac￾teristics for the 2011 study period with the combined
data for the corresponding periods in 2009 and 2010.
We used a two-sided Student t test for numerical vari￾ables and the χ2 test for categorical variables. Statistical
significance was set at p<0.05.
RESULTS
For the first 60 days following the earthquake, all sched￾uled admissions to Japanese Red Cross Ishinomaki
Hospital were cancelled and only emergency admissions
were accepted. During this period, 1769 patients were
admitted to the hospital, 322 of whom were hospitalised
for respiratory disease. In the corresponding periods in
2009 and 2010, there were 850 (99 for respiratory
disease) and 1030 (105 for respiratory disease)

unscheduled admissions, respectively. Patients hospita￾lised for respiratory disease accounted for 18.2% of total
admissions during the 2011 study period. This propor￾tion was significantly higher than that in 2009 (11.6%;
p<0.001) or 2010 (10.2%; p<0.001). While the number of
admissions in 2011 was approximately twice that in 2009
or 2010, hospitalisation for respiratory disease in 2011
was three or more times greater than in 2009 or 2010.
The overall number of hospitalisations peaked during
the first 10 days, while the number of admissions for
respiratory disease continued to increase for the first
20 days (figure 1A,B).
We compared the numbers and proportions of
patients hospitalised for respiratory disease between
2011, 2010 and 2009 (figure 2). Pneumonia was the
most frequent disease (n=190, 59.0%), followed by
AE-COPD (n=53, 16.5%), asthma attacks (n=27, 8.4%)
and progression of lung cancer (n=22, 6.8%). One case
of AE-COPD and seven cases of asthma attacks were
physician diagnoses. The category ‘others’ included
pneumothorax, restrictive thoracic disease, pleural effu￾sion, influenza, drowning, primary pulmonary hyperten￾sion, requirement for mechanical ventilation for
neuromuscular disease, etc. One patient diagnosed with
pneumonia who also had an asthma attack, and two
patients with COPD exacerbated by pneumonia were
treated for both conditions and counted as pneumonia.
In comparison with the previous 2 years, the increase in
the number of hospitalisations was greatest for pneumo￾nia, followed by AE-COPD and asthma attacks. The
numbers of hospitalisation for progression of lung
cancer and for ‘others’ were similar to those in the pre￾vious 2 years. In 2011, 39.4% of patients were hospita￾lised from emergency shelters.
To investigate the disease-specific effect of the earth￾quake, the age and sex of each patient with a particular
disease were compared between the study period in 2011
and the corresponding periods in the previous 2 years.
The mean age of patients hospitalised for respiratory
disease was significantly higher in 2011 than in the pre￾ceding 2 years (75.7±12.5 vs 73.2±13.4 years old; p=0.03).
There were fewer males in 2011 compared to the previ￾ous 2 years (59.6% in 2011, 67.2% in 2010 and 2009;
p=0.08). Specifically, pneumonia patients and AE-COPD
patients were significantly older in 2011 compared to
2010 and 2009 (pneumonia patients were 77.6±11.8 vs
74.3±12.8 years old; p=0.03, while AE-COPD patients were

76.0±8.7 vs 69.5±15.9 years old; p=0.03). Significantly
more males had AE-COPD (81.1% vs 50.0%; p=0.01), but
significantly fewer had asthma attacks in 2011 compared
with 2010 and 2009 (18.5% vs 54.6%; p=0.03).
The numbers of admissions for the main respiratory
diseases for each 10-day bin during the study period are
shown in figure 3. Pneumonia peaked during the
second 10-day bin, AE-COPD and asthma attacks peaked
during the third 10-day bin and progression of lung
cancer peaked in the fifth 10-day bin.
Next, we investigated ADL status at hospitalisation and
before the disaster among patients admitted during the
2011 study period. Because of the confused situation
after the disaster, ADL status was not recorded in 11
patients. At hospitalisation, 195 patients (60.5%) were
‘dependent’ and 54 patients (16.7%) were ‘partially
dependent’. However, before the earthquake, only 86
patients (26.7%) were ‘dependent’ and 51 patients
(15.8%) were ‘partially dependent’. To investigate the
impact of ADL status and its deterioration on time of
admission for pulmonary disease after the disaster, we
counted the number of patients who were ‘originally
dependent’, ‘newly dependent’ or ‘independent
throughout’ in each of the 10-day bins (figure 4).
Throughout the study period, the majority of patients
were dependent or partially dependent. In the first
20 days, the majority of admissions were for ‘originally
dependent’ patients. After 3 weeks, there was a sharp
increase in ‘newly dependent’ patients, as assessed by
ADL status. Independent patients were mainly hospita￾lised during the first 20 days.
Table 1 shows the relationship between ADL category
(‘independent throughout’, ‘newly dependent’ and
‘originally dependent’) and patient age, sex and diagno￾sis. The ratio of each disease was calculated for each cat￾egory. Eleven patients whose ADL status was not
completely recorded were excluded from the analysis.
Young and male patients were more frequent in the
order ‘independent’, ‘newly dependent’ and ‘originally
dependent’. In regard to patient diagnosis, proportion
of pneumonia and progression of lung cancer increased
in the same order, while the proportion of AE-COPD
and asthma decreased.
DISCUSSION
Summary
In this retrospective descriptive and cross-sectional study,
we found a substantial increase in the proportion of
elderly patients hospitalised for respiratory disease after
the earthquake and tsunami. Pneumonia, AE-COPD and

asthma attacks were more common after the disaster.
The mean age of patients hospitalised for respiratory
disease was significantly higher than that in the corre￾sponding periods in the previous 2 years. The majority
of patients had poor ADL status and many experienced
deterioration in ADL status after the disaster.
Effect on respiratory disease
Previous reports on the Hanshin-Awaji earthquake
showed an initial increase in patients with injury and a
subsequent increase in patients with respiratory disease,
especially pneumonia.11–13 Similarly, our observation
showed a marked increase in pneumonia patients,
although there was no initial increase in patients with
serious injury as the majority of victims drowned and
heavily injured patients were rarely transferred to
hospital.
The epidemiology of respiratory disease varies depend￾ing on the situation. For instance, after the 2004
Sumatra-Andaman earthquake and subsequent tsunami,
the number of lower respiratory infections in Ache
rapidly increased and then sharply declined during the
second week.14 However, after the 1995 Hanshin-Awaji
earthquake, the number of patients hospitalised for
pneumonia increased gradually and remained high for
over 2 months9 10 as pneumonia developed more slowly.
In the Sumatra-Andaman earthquake, many cases of
pneumonia resulted from aspiration of tsunami-water in
near-drowning events (‘tsunami lung’).15 16 On the other
hand, in the Hanshin-Awaji earthquake, numerous,
mostly elderly patients staying in the unhealthy condi￾tions of shelters developed pneumonia (‘shelter pneumo￾nia’).17 In this earthquake and tsunami, we experienced
few cases of pneumonia directly caused by aspiration of
tsunami-water. A few patients came from the field, but
most were from shelters, their own or relative’s homes,
other hospitals or nursing homes. Their mean age was
significantly higher than in 2009 or 2010. Therefore, we
regarded and treated most of the pneumonia as ‘shelter
pneumonia’. We were unable to carry out bacteriological
tests for 14 days after the earthquake due to a shortage
of water, fuel and manpower. Most pneumonias were
considered ‘aspiration pneumonia acquired in a nursing
home’ because of the patients’ ADL status.
Cases of AE-COPD were also significantly increased.
COPD was one of the most common chronic respiratory
diseases, especially in the elderly. It is well known that
interruption of treatment for chronic disease frequently
exacerbates the patient’s condition, as after a natural dis￾aster.14 18–20 Many patients lost their drugs in the
tsunami, and therefore disruption of regular medication
may partly account for the increase in AE-COPD admis￾sions. Also, the weather was sunny and windy from the
end of March and dust from the tsunami sludge was an
important component of particulate air pollution and
may have contributed to the significant rise in the
number of admissions for AE-COPD.
Although asthma was also a common chronic respira￾tory disease and had the same precipitating cause as
COPD, asthma attacks did not increase as much as
AE-COPD, perhaps because of two important differences
between the two conditions. First, COPD patients were
generally older than those with asthma and so the base￾line health status of COPD patients was poorer than that
of those with asthma.21 As a result, COPD patients
required more frequent hospitalisation. In our study, the
mean age of AE-COPD patients was higher than that of
those experiencing asthma attacks. Second, bacterial
respiratory infection affects patients with COPD more
than those with asthma.22 In the aftermath of the disas￾ter, poorer hygiene and overcrowding in shelters would
have increased the risk of respiratory bacterial infection
resulting in AE-COPD.
Hospitalisation for lung cancer related symptoms
increased only slightly and actually declined as a propor￾tion of total admissions for respiratory diseases. The
mean age of lung cancer patients was similar to that in
the previous 2 years. Maeda et al23 also reported that no
increase in lung cancer related hospitalisation was
observed after the Hanshin-Awaji earthquake. As lung
cancer progression may be influenced less by the envir￾onment than by growth of the cancer, the disaster would
not impact on lung cancer immediately. Although the
interruption of chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy
would have worsened prognosis, this cannot be con￾firmed during our study period.
Effect on ADL status
In the acute phase following the disaster, patients with
poor ADL status, especially those ‘originally dependent’,
were hospitalised for pulmonary diseases, typically pneu￾monia, although substantial numbers of patients with
good ADL status were also hospitalised. After 3 weeks,
there was a sharp increase in ‘newly dependent’ patients
whose ADL status had deteriorated. It was reported that
physical disability was an independent risk factor for
death in the Hanshin-Awaji earthquake and the 1999
Taiwan earthquake.9 10 However, those reports investi￾gated mortality in the acute phase, not hospitalisation in
the subacute or chronic phases. After the earthquake
and tsunami, one in four Ishinomaki residents moved
into shelters, many of which were also flooded by the
tsunami. They lacked water and food and lived in
unheated and overcrowded conditions, with many sleep￾ing on the floor. As a result, the elderly had restricted
consumption of food and water, and kept still in a small
space, resulting in deterioration in their ADL status. In
addition, scarcity of water worsened oral hygiene. Poor
functional status and loss of oral hygiene were the major
risk factor for pneumonia,24–27 especially in the elderly,
many of whom were subsequently hospitalised for
‘shelter pneumonia’. Also, poor oral hygiene induces
swallowing dysfunction28 which could be a risk factor for
COPD exacerbation29 and may explain why AE-COPD
increased especially in the elderly.

Effect on an aging society
According to the report of the Japanese government, in
the Great East Japan earthquake 93% of deaths
occurred as a result of drowning and over 60% of these
victims were over 60 years of age. Many previous studies
have noted that the elderly are at greater risk of death
after earthquakes; however, the proportion of elderly
people killed in this earthquake and tsunami was
extremely high compared to other similar disasters.4–8
Comparable findings were reported only for 1995
Hanshin-Awaji earthquake and the 2004 mid-Niigata
earthquake, both in Japan.12 17 Moreover, 90.8% of
patients hospitalised for respiratory disease after the
earthquake in our study were over 60 years of age. These
results suggest that the elderly are vulnerable immedi￾ately and also for a while after earthquakes.
In the 1999 Taiwan earthquake, the 2003 heat waves in
the Czech Republic, and the 2004 Sumatra-Andaman
earthquake, subsequent decreased mortality in the
affected areas was the result of the large number of
direct deaths caused by the disasters among vulnerable
populations such as the elderly or children,5 30 31 the
so-called ‘harvesting effect’. However, our observation
suggests that, in an aging society, a disaster not only dir￾ectly kills the vulnerable but also produces a new vulner￾able population. Previous reports demonstrated that a
prolonged harmful effect on mental health and slow psy￾chological recovery were seen more frequently in the
elderly than in young people.32–35 Therefore, we should
provide long-term care to the elderly after a disaster.
Implications for policy and practice
Our observations suggest two important targets for redu￾cing hospitalisation for respiratory disease after a major
disaster in an aging society: interrupted chronic respira￾tory disease treatment and deterioration in ADL status.
Interruption of treatment for chronic respiratory disease
could be prevented if a few days’ stored drug supply
were available. This would necessitate a storage system
containing regional prescription data for each drug and
personal medication data. Telemedicine systems or web￾based patient data storage systems might be useful.
Prevention of deterioration in ADL status is also import￾ant. Elderly people are potentially vulnerable and their
ADL status can easily deteriorate. In our study, living in
shelters for more than 3 weeks resulted in deterioration
in ADL status and hospitalisation for respiratory diseases.
Therefore, we propose that the elderly should be evacu￾ated from disaster areas as quickly as possible.
Strengths and weaknesses of this study
Our study has two important strengths. First, the Great
East Japan Earthquake affected one of the most rapidly
aging societies in the world.3 As the proportion of
elderly people continues to increase in both developed
and developing countries, there is an urgent need for
information on and analysis of aging societies. The find￾ings of our study are applicable to natural disasters
worldwide. Secondly, we were able to obtain detailed
information on patient demographics, diagnosis and
ADL status in a catastrophic situation. This was because
our hospital continued to function and maintained its
electronic medical record systems and laboratory
systems, despite a devastating earthquake and tsunami
which severely affected most other medical facilities, and
because staff in our hospital had received earthquake
training and had recorded our experiences as memos or
on digital recorders for analysis for disaster medicine.
Our study was conducted in a single centre. This
might be a weakness of our study, but our hospital was
the only functional hospital after the disaster in the
Ishinomaki medical zone which experienced over 30%
of the total fatalities in this earthquake. Also, it was the
only hospital in the medical zone with a department of
respiratory medicine and pulmonary specialists, and pre￾viously had accepted most seriously ill patients with pul￾monary disease who needed hospitalisation. Therefore,
we think our study accurately describes the impact of the
earthquake on pulmonary diseases and explains what
happened in a hospital directly affected by the earth￾quake.2 However, it is also weakness of our study that we
only analysed hospitalised patients as there were also
numerous outpatients, many of whom died. These
events will be analysed in a future report. Another weak￾ness is that a cross-sectional study cannot elucidate a
causal relationship. Finally, we did not clearly define
conditions for hospitalisation. Because of the destruction
of the normal healthcare system and poor hygiene
outside the hospital, we admitted some patients who
normally would have been treated in an outpatient
setting. However, this was a real situation after a devastat￾ing disaster.
CONCLUSION
The Great East Japan earthquake and subsequent
tsunami affected one of the most rapidly aging societies
in the world. After the disaster, pneumonia, COPD
exacerbation and asthma attacks associated with low
ADL status in the elderly significantly contributed to the
increase in hospitalisation for pulmonary diseases. These
observations should be used when planning emergency
medical management for disasters in a progressive but
rapidly aging society.
