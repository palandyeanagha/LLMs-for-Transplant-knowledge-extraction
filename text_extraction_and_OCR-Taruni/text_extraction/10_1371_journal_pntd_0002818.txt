Abstract
Background: Chagas disease kills approximately 45 thousand people annually and affects 10 million people in Latin America
and the southern United States. The parasite that causes the disease, Trypanosoma cruzi, can be transmitted by insects of
the family Reduviidae, subfamily Triatominae. Any study that attempts to evaluate risk for Chagas disease must focus on the
ecology and biogeography of these vectors. Expected distributional shifts of vector species due to climate change are likely
to alter spatial patterns of risk of Chagas disease, presumably through northward expansion of high risk areas in North
America.
Methodology/Principal Findings: We forecast the future (2050) distributions in North America of Triatoma gerstaeckeri and
T. sanguisuga, two of the most common triatomine species and important vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi in the southern
United States. Our aim was to analyze how climate change might affect the future shift of Chagas disease in North America
using a maximum entropy algorithm to predict changes in suitable habitat based on vector occurrence points and
predictive environmental variables. Projections based on three different general circulation models (CCCMA, CSIRO, and
HADCM3) and two IPCC scenarios (A2 and B2) were analyzed. Twenty models were developed for each case and evaluated
via cross-validation. The final model averages result from all twenty of these models. All models had AUC .0.90, which
indicates that the models are robust. Our results predict a potential northern shift in the distribution of T. gerstaeckeri and a
northern and southern distributional shift of T. sanguisuga from its current range due to climate change.
Conclusions/Significance: The results of this study provide baseline information for monitoring the northward shift of
potential risk from Chagas disease in the face of climate change.

Introduction
Climate change has been implicated in shifts of the geographic
distribution of many species[1], enabling some taxa to increase
their distributions into northern latitudes [1,2]. Thus, changes in
climate can potentially alter the spatial range of vector-borne
diseases through shifts in geographical distributions of their vectors
[3,4,5]. Despite some positive developments such as better access
to clean drinking water, lower exposure to insect vectors, and
higher-quality housing, the projected changes in climate over the
next decades may exacerbate infectious disease incidence even in
developed regions such as North America [6]. Habitat changes,
alterations in water storage and irrigation habits, pollution,
development of insecticide and drug resistance, globalization,
tourism and travel are additional factors that may help to
aggravate this threat [4].
The southern United States is highly vulnerable to outbreaks of
vector-borne diseases due to many factors, including poor housing
conditions, suboptimal drainage, lack of electricity in some areas,
the presence of feral dogs, and human migration [7,8,9].
Moreover, that some southern states, such as Texas, share a
legacy of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs [9]) with Mexico,
increases the urgency of the development and deployment of
active surveillance programs necessary for optimal management

and control of vector-borne diseases including Chagas disease
[7,9] and leishmaniasis [5].
Chagas disease is a zoonosis caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, a
flagellated protozoan parasite. Trypanosoma cruzi is transferred from
mammalian reservoirs (e.g., Neotoma woodrats) to humans through
a triatomine vector [7]. These vectors are insects from the family
Reduviidae, sub-family Triatominae [7,10]. Trypanosoma cruzi is
most characteristically transmitted by infected feces of triatomines
entering the human bloodstream. However, it can also be
transmitted through blood transfusion, organ transplants and
ingestion of infected food; congenital parasite transmission has also
been demonstrated [7]. After contamination with the parasite,
Chagas disease develops from an acute phase (period during which
the parasites can be found easily in the blood) followed by an
asymptomatic period of varying length; this stage is called the
indeterminate phase. During the indeterminate phase, the
parasites disappear from the blood. A chronic phase can be
followed after 5 to 40 years, and ,30% of infected people develop
the disease [11,12].
Chagas disease kills approximately 45,000 people annually [13]
and affects 10 million people in several countries of Latin America
[14]. In the United States around 300,000 individuals could be
infected with T. cruzi, causing a considerable disease burden [15].
Several factors might influence the geographical distribution of
Trypanosoma cruzi vectors and reservoirs (e.g., historical presence,
the existence of barriers and dispersal capabilities), but anthropo￾genic factors play a fundamental role in the spread of the disease
(e.g., through habitat changes, globalization, and travel [4]). The
geographical distribution of Chagas disease has increased beyond
regions of endemic occurrence during the last half-century and is
now considered a worldwide problem [10].
Species distribution models (SDMs) based on machine-learning
algorithms and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) platforms
have been used to predict areas of potential distribution of
Trypanosoma cruzi vectors [7,16,17,18,19]. These analyses typically
show that climatic factors significantly influence the potential
geographic distributions of vector (and reservoir) species. Addi￾tionally, temperature may have a particularly strong influence on
the behavior of triatomine species [20,21]. For instance, temper￾atures exceeding 30uC combined with low humidity,cause insects
toincrease their feeding rate to avoid dehydration. In addition, in
domestic life cycles, when indoor temperatures increase, the
insects may develop shorter life cycles and higher population
densities [20]. High temperatures can also speed up the
development of T. cruzi in vectors [22].
In this paper, we forecast the future (2050) distribution in North
America of Triatoma gerstaeckeri and T. sanguisuga, two of the most
commonly found triatomine species and important vectors in the
southern United States [7]. Triatoma gerstaeckeri is one of the most
widely distributed Triatoma species in Texas [7], occurring mainly
in the southern areas of the state. It is also found in New Mexico
Author Summary
Chagas disease kills thousands of people annually.
Triatomine insects (family Reduviidae, sub-family Triatomi￾nae), can be potential vectors of the parasite (Trypanosoma
cruzi) that causes the disease. There are often no
symptoms until cardiac and digestive system dysfunction
(possibly including heart failure) after 10 to 30 years of
infection. Climate change can shift the distribution of
triatomine insects, favoring the spread of the disease to
non-original areas. We used distributional information on
the most commonly found triatomine species and the
most important vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi in South
Texas and North Mexico (T. gerstaeckeri and T. sanguisuga),
and explanatory climatic variables to forecast the potential
distribution of the insects in the year 2050. We used two
different scenarios of climate change and three different
general circulation models. Our results showed that the
triatomine species studied will likely shift their distribution
northwards in the future. There is thus a need to monitor
areas that are not currently endemic for Chagas disease
but may potentially be affected in the future due to
climate change.

and in northeast Mexico [7]. Triatoma gerstaeckeri is more frequently
found in economically poorly-developed areas; though it is
naturally found in sylvan environments, it is able to disperse to
human dwellings [23]. Triatoma sanguisuga can be found in several
environments similar to T. gerstaeckeri, including domestic sur￾roundings [24]. Triatoma sanguisuga has been found in several states
across United States including Alabama, Arizona, Florida,
Georgia, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi,
Missouri, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio,
Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas,
and Virginia [24]. The species has also been found near the
Canadian border in Illinois and Indiana [20]. We used geographic
information (longitude/latitude distributional data) (Tables S1 and
S2) and explanatory climatic variables (temperature, precipitation,
etc., Table 1) to produce Species Distribution Models (SDMs)
using a maximum entropy algorithm. Current SDMs were
projected to 2050 using three different Global General Circulation
models (the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis
(CCCMA), the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research
Organization (CSIRO) and the Hadley Centre for Climate
Change (HADCM3). We used two scenarios A2A and B2A from
the International Panel on Climate Change [1]. Our aim was to
analyze how climate change might affect the future spread of
Chagas disease in North America.
Materials and Methods
Geographic data
For modeling purposes, geographic data (i.e., longitude and
latitude) were gathered from data bases from museum collections,
voluntary collectors, and through field work by members of our
team in South Texas. For the original field work reported here,
insects were collected either from public lands or donated by the
owners of private lands. As a pilot study, field work was conducted
in one sylvatic area, ‘‘La Sal del Rey’’, Texas (26u 319 N and 98u
039 W), on 8 July 2011. We did not collect insects in domestic
areas, we only included the La Sal del Rey locality in the model
construction. To collect the insects, we used suspended dark
ultraviolet light traps with a white background sheet and baited
with carbon dioxide from dry ice. All geographic localities for both
species are reported in Supplemental files (Tables S1 and S2).
Following the methodology of Sarkar et al. [7], only post-1980
records with an estimated error of ,1.0 km were used; these
choices ensured compatibility between the resolution of the
occurrence data and the spatial and temporal resolution of the
environmental layers.
Study area
The study area includes the continental portions of Mexico and
the United States and was delimited in the south by the 14u559S
line of latitude and to the north by the 49u 389N line of latitude,
continued by the lines 266u 979E boundary and 2124u 719W. It
was divided into 14 520 497 cells with an average area of 1.03 km2
(SD = 0.27). This ensured the enclosure of all points used in the
analysis.
Model building and evaluation
Present and projected future potential distributions for the
target species were computed using presence records for the
species (longitude/latitude) and with climatic parameters as
exploratory variables, using a maximum entropy algorithm
incorporated in the Maxent software package [11,25]. Maxent
predicts probability values (thresholds) from 0 (least suitable) to 1
(most suitable) of habitat suitability over the study area [11,25].
We used Maxent Version 3.3.3k (http://www.cs.princeton.edu/
,schapire/maxent/) with the default modeling parameters
(convergence threshold = 105
, maximum iterations = 500, regu￾larization value b= auto) [26]. Climatic variables were selected
from the 19 WorldClim variables [27] available at WorldClim
database. Following Sarkar et al. [7], four climatic variables were
eliminated from the analysis since these variables have presumed
artifactual discontinuities for Texas (mean temperatures of the
wettest quarter, driest quarter, warmest quarter, and coldest
quarter; Table 1). These climatic variables have a resolution of
approximately 161 km2 (more accurately, 30 arc-seconds).
Twenty models were developed and evaluated via cross-validation
per species. The final model presented is the average of the
replicates. Model results were processed and visualized using
ArcGIS 10.
For the future climate projections we used three GCMs: the
Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis (CCCMA),
the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organiza￾tion (CSIRO) and the Hadley Centre for Climate Change
(HADCM3). We used two scenarios of climate change, A2A and
B2A, from the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC
2007). Both scenarios assume a more heterogeneous world and are
oriented toward regionalization. The A2A scenario assumes an
increase in population, economic development, regionally oriented
and per capita economic growth and technological change that is
more fragmented than the scenario B2A. The focus of this
scenario is more economic. On the other hand, the B2A scenario
describes a world in which the emphasis is on local solutions to
economic, social and environmental sustainability. It assumes a
constant increase of population, but at a rate lower than A2A and
intermediate levels of economic development as well. This
scenario is oriented towards environmental protection and social
equity.
Model evaluation
We calculated the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of Receiver
Operating Characteristic plots (ROC); [28] to evaluate the models
by cross-validation of the 20 replicates using the training and test
data as described above. Receiver Operating Characteristic is a
threshold–independent measure that evaluates the sensitivity
(probability that the model produces a positive result in a positive
locality) versus the specificity (probability that the model produces
a negative result in a negative locality) of a model when presented
with new data. A ROC plot is obtained by plotting the sensitivity
on the y–axis versus one minus specificity for all available decision
thresholds on the x–axis. The theoretically perfect result is AUC
= 1, whereas a test performing no better than random yields AUC

(www.worldclim.org) was multiplied by 10.

= 0.5. The AUC was calculated internally by Maxent. The final
AUC is the average AUC for all maps.
Shifts in suitable habitat in the future
The averaged habitat suitability spatial distributions were
converted into binary maps for further analysis using two
thresholds: a ‘‘minimum training presence threshold’’ and a 0.5
habitat suitability threshold. A ‘‘minimum training presence
threshold’’ is a threshold in which at least one known presence
for the target species was found; therefore it guarantees that all
presences are predicted as suitable [29]. Shifts on suitable habitat
were calculated in km2
. Percentage of change in suitable habitat
comparing present and future projections was calculated using the
formula ((future gain - future loss)*100)/present area.
Results
A total of 84 unique geo-referenced localities, i.e., one locality
per cell, were used to develop models of present and future suitable
habitat for Triatoma gerstaeckeri and 24 for T. sanguisuga (Tables S1
and S2). Table 2 shows AUC values. For T. gertaeckeri the averages
AUC were 0.9857 (SD = 0.0015) and 0.9738 (SD = 0.0279) for
training and testing data, respectively; for T. sanguisuga the
corresponding numbers were 0.9680 (SD = 0.0026) and 0.9323
(SD = 0.0982). Figures 1 and 2 show models of present and future
distributions for both species.
Models of future distribution for the suitable habitat of T.
gerstaeckeri show a shift to northern areas in USA, with projected
suitable habitat in Michigan and in New York (Fig 1B-E).
However, distributional shifts northward showed marked differ￾ences in habitat suitability between different climate change
models and scenarios. For example, CCCMA-A2A and CCCMA￾B2A models showed wide regions of unsuitable habitat between
extant distributions and future northward shifts (Fig 1B–C).
Conversely, CSIRO-A2A and CSIRO-ABA models showed
contiguous suitable habitat between extant distribution and future
northward shifts (Fig 1D–E). No shifts were observed between
extant and future distributions with HADCM3_A2A and
HADCM3_B2A models (Fig 1F–G)
Increases in future suitable habitat can be also observed for T.
sanguisuga through the northeast and northwest of the USA. In all
models, north-east shifts showed contiguous habitat suitability.
This was not the case for future northwest shifts, where regions of
unsuitable habitat were observed between extant and future shifts,
except for the CCCMA-A2A model (Fig 2B). In just one model,
CCCMA-A2A, the suitable habitat for this vector extended
to Florida (Fig 2B). For this species, a shift of suitable habitat
to South Texas (Lower Rio Grande Valley) and North Mexico in
the State of Tamaulipas is observed using the HADCM3
model for both A2A and B2A (Fig. 2F–G) scenarios of the
IPCC, while the CCCMA and CSIRO models (Fig. 2B–E)
showing lower suitability habitat compared with the model of
present distribution for this region (South Texas-northern Mexico)
(Fig. 2A)
For both triatomine species, the variable that contributed the
most to the distribution of the species was annual mean
temperature (Figs. 1-H and 2-H). The minimum training presence
threshold value for T. gerstaeckeri was 0.017 and for T. sanguisuga
0.068. For T. gerstaeckeri, the 0.5 threshold predicted loss on
suitable habitat in 2050 compared with the minimum presence
threshold for climatic change scenarios, A2A and B2A, and the
three general circulation models (CCCMA, CSIRO, and
HADCM3) (Table 3). For T. sanguisuga, both thresholds predicted
an expansion of the suitable habitat by 2050 (Table 3).
Discussion
For both species, Triatoma gerstaeckeri and T. sanguisuga, our
SDMs predicted that there may be range shifts as result of climate
change. Species distribution models for T. gerstaeckeri [30] and
other triatomine species of North America [31] have been
developed previously to this paper, but these models were
constructed with a coarser spatial resolution (e.g. .1 km2
). The
influence of climatic change has been previously addressed by
other authors with a consideration of three triatomine species (T.
lecticularia, T. protacta, and T. sanguisuga) [30]. However, our analysis
is the first attempt to model future distribution of suitable habitat
for Triatoma gersteckeri and T. sanguisuga performed with the
knowledge that all specimens were professionally identified and
all locations for the species were explicitly reviewed for accuracy in
their geography and method of recording (GPS coordinates with
.1m error) and with a finer spatial resolution (1 km2
). In addition,
the cross validation and the low standard deviations in the
model evaluations show no sampling biases attributed to the
Figure 2. Present (A) and future (2050; B–G) potential distribution for Triatoma sanguisuga. All models predict a shift in the distribution of
this species towards northern and eastern regions of Mexico and USA. Black color = high suitable habitat vs. white color = no suitable habitat for the
species. General circulation models and climatic scenarios: B = CCCMA-A2A; C = CCCMA-B2A; D = CSIRO-A2A; E = CSIRO-B2A; F = HADCM3_A2A;
G = HADCM3_B2A. Variable with most contribution on the species distribution was Annual Mean Temperature (H), which as per the original data
(www.worldclim.org) was multiplied by 10.

heterogeneity in the source of data and insect collection protocols.
That is, models were neither strengthened nor weakened by
the inclusion or exclusion of localities chosen based on this
information.
Our results support [32] the conclusion that an increase in
temperature is correlated with a potential increase of Chagas
disease risk, defined as shifts in suitable habitat of T. gerstaeckeri and
T. sanguisuga in the United States. Future distribution models
showed marked differences for both triatomine species with
important consequences for predicting Chagas disease risk.
Overall, future distributions for T. gerstaeckeri showed wide
discontinuous regions of suitable habitat between extant distribu￾tions and north-east shifts in the US. Thus, future north-east shifts
of T. gerstaeckeri will depend heavily on natural abilities of this
triatomine to disperse across wide regions of unsuitable habitat or
to be transported by humans, except for CSIRO-A2A model
showing more contiguous suitable habitat (Fig 1D). Two models,
HADCM3_A2A, and HADCM3_B2A, did not predict northward
shifts of this triatomine to Michigan and New York (Fig 1F–G).
Predicted north-east shifts of T. sanguisuga suggest contiguous
suitable habitat, facilitating potential dispersal of this species to
Michigan and New York (Fig 2A–G). Thus, T. sanguisuga is the
target species most likely to be a threat of spreading Chagas
disease in the north-eastern US, although this species is not
considered an efficient vector for transmitting the parasite to
humans [33]. Conversely, a different Chagas disease risk resulted
for future shifts in northwest US. For both triatomine species,
north-west shifts included wide areas of discontinuous suitable
habitat between extant and future distributions (excluding T.
sanguisuga in the CCCMA-A2A model). Thus, future shifts
necessarily require high dispersal abilities for both triatomine
species to represent a Chagas disease risk in north-west US.
Other similar studies have identified important future shifts in
north-east United States for other vector-borne diseases such as
leishmaniasis [5]. Future distributional shifts of vector species
can help to forecast expected number of human individuals
potentially exposed to infectious diseases under climate change
scenarios.
In addition to climate, several other factors not considered in
this analysis could influence the distribution of the insects both
under present circumstances and future ones. These factors can be
biological (i.e., species interactions: competition, parasitism and
trophic interactions), historical (e.g., barriers and speciation
process), geographic (capabilities of dispersion, accessible regions
for dispersal, evolutionary capacity of species’ populations to adapt
to new conditions), and/or anthropogenic[34,35]. However,
climatic variables (abiotic factors) are frequently used to estimate
species’ distributions [36,37] since climate can limit distributions
directly by affecting growth or survival (e.g., lower and upper
lethal temperatures), and indirectly via interacting species (e.g.,
food sources, pathogens, competitors, or predators). Additionally,
mechanism-based analysis have shown that temperature might
have a strong influence on the behavior of triatomine species
[20,21], increasing their feeding rate when temperature increases
and humidity is low, or by developing shorter life cycles and higher
population densities [20]. High temperatures can also speed up the
development of T. cruzi in vectors [22]. Therefore, as seen in our
results, changes in temperature and precipitation based on the
different climate change scenarios and general circulatory models
can positively influence the spread of triatomine species to non￾original distribution in North America.
Any study that attempts to evaluate the risk for Chagas disease
should focus on the ecology and biogeography of triatomine
vectors and reservoir species (e.g., woodrats), as well as the
incidence of the parasite that causes the disease, Trypanosoma cruzi
[7]. There is currently research to develop a vaccine for Chagas
disease [9], but this is not available yet and drug treatments have
limited efficacy. Chagas disease is controlled by using insecticides
and improvements in housing, but such publicly organized
programs do not exist in the United States, partly due to lack of
information regarding human cases, vector-parasite incidence, and
reservoirs of the disease. Studies that can provide baseline data for
addressing these critical concerns should combine field work,
molecular analysis (e.g., examining blood meals of triatomines)
and ecological modeling techniques to assess the potential for
Chagas disease at a fine-geographic scale (e.g., areas at most risk
for Chagas disease; see [38]) are encouraged. Findings from that
work can be used to advise health program managers in their
efforts to control or prevent transmission of Chagas disease
effectively and provide a cost-effective method of predicting
locations of high transmission risk of this disease, particularly in
light of the economic burden that Chagas disease might represent
(similar or higher than other diseases such as rotavirus, cervical
cancer, or Lyme disease [39]).
Concluding remarks
Although we acknowledge several important shortcomings
discussed below, our study emphasizes one issue that has not
been previously considered: the importance of climate change in
the transmission of T. cruzi.
The transmission of T. cruzi includes several vectors and hosts in
domestic, peri-domestic, and sylvatic cycles. Trypanosoma. cruzi has
three infective forms capable of infecting its host, and currently 6
DTUs (discrete typing units) are recognized in the taxon. These
DTUs establish with mammalian hosts peculiar interactions in
distinct time-space scales. Thus, the transmission of T. cruzi is a
complex system for its non-linearity, unpredictability and also for
being multivariable.
Ideally, the potential distribution of most hosts should be
included in the modeling exercises. We know relatively little about
which mammal species are confirmed hosts of T. cruzi. To include
simply a large list of mammals into the modeling approach without
the certainty of being confirmed hosts of this parasite will add
confusion into our understanding of this crucial biotic interaction.
More studies are needed to produce a comprehensive list of
confirmed hosts for T. cruzi as well as time-space scales for the
operative interactions of hosts, vectors, and parasites. Novel
modeling techniques developed to provide a predictive list of
potential hosts for other emerging diseases, such as leishmaniasis
[40], can be applied for T. cruzi.
Landscape and ecotypic scenarios under climate change are also
needed to refine distribution shifts of species at finer spatial scales.
This information should be associated with data on the salient
features of landscape diversity, roles of extant members of regional
mammalian faunas, local cultural, social and economic diversity,
as well as the land use practices. This information will provide a
more comprehensive understanding of the complexity in the
transmission of T. cruzi.
