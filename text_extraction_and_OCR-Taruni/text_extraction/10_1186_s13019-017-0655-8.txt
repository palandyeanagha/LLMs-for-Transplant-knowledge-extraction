Abstract
Background: Evidence suggests that elective cardiac patients are at risk of functional and psychological deterioration
in the time preceding surgery. This poses a risk to successful post-operative rehabilitation. This prospective one-group
pre-test, post-test evaluation was designed to assess a clinical Pre-operative Rehabilitation (PREHAB) home-based
exercise programme, to optimise pre-operative physical function and frailty in patients awaiting elective Coronary
Artery By-Pass Graft (CABG) or Valve Surgery.
Method: Consenting patients awaiting cardiac surgery, with wait time ≥ 6 weeks were referred to a Senior Physiotherapist
for baseline assessment. Patients were offered PREHAB in the form of functional home-based exercise that was prescribed
from baseline physical outcomes. All patients were followed up via telephone to ensure progression of exercise and any
problems associated with it. This continued weekly until the patient attended Surgical Pre-assessment clinic, where all
outcome measures were re-assessed.
Results: Twenty two patients, out of a total number of 36 patients seen in the surgical clinic between March 2016 and
August 2016, participated in the prehab clinical evaluation. Twenty patients completed their prescribed exercises on a
weekly basis prior to surgery. No adverse events or cardiac symptoms were reported as a result of the home exercise
intervention. Paired t-Test analyses revealed a significant mean difference in clinical frailty score (CFS) of −0.53 ± 0.51
(95% CI [−0.774, −0.279], P = 0.0003). Significant mean difference in six-minute walk test (6MWT) distance of 42.5 ± 27.
8 m (95% CI [23.840, 61.251], P = 0.0005), 6MWT walking speed of 0.5 ± 0.4kmh (95% CI, [0.2433, 0.7567],
P = 0.001), and short physical performance battery (SPPB) total score of 2.2 ± 1.7, (95% CI [3.066, 1.200],
P = 0.0002) were also observed. The change in 6MWT distance was shown to be significantly associated
with hospital length of stay (LOS) (r = 0.7; P = 0.03).
Conclusion: This small exploratory evaluation suggests that providing a home-based PREHAB programme for frail
patients undergoing CABG or Valve surgery may be able to improve functional ability and reduce hospital length of stay
for those patients undergoing cardiac surgery. A frailty score with greater sensitivity may be required to elucidate the
influence frailty could have in reducing length of stay. A large randomised controlled study is required to reveal the
potential beneficial effects of PREHAB in this patient population.

Background
By the year 2039, it is estimated that 24.3% of the UK
population will be aged 65 or over. Advancements in
technology, medical treatment and improved post￾surgical morbidity and mortality, means the number of
older adults undergoing surgical procedures is increasing
faster than the rate of the population aging [1–4]. This
aging population present with greater comorbidities and
frailty, in turn posing significant risk to a successful
post-operative recovery. Wait times for elective cardiac
surgery vary but evidence shows patients ultimately de￾teriorate functionally and psychologically during this
period prior to surgery.
The use of frailty as a risk factor or determinant in pre￾dicting adverse postsurgical outcome is evolving [5, 6].
Longer wait times for surgery see a trend towards deteri￾oration in both a patients’ psychological and physiological
condition, suggesting that the overall condition of those
awaiting cardiac surgery should be monitored continu￾ously [7]. It’s indicated that as much as 45% of patients
claimed their own health had suffered along with raised
levels of anxiety amongst spouses [8].
Older adults undergo surgery twice as often as their
younger counterparts [9], and commonly have a lower
functional reserve in many body systems, making it
more difficult to atone for the stress of surgery. Conse￾quently, they often face greater postoperative complica￾tions. [9, 10]. Defining and categorising frailty has long
created a challenge for health care professionals and re￾searchers. Frailty can be described as a state of risk or
vulnerability, a precarious balance between demands and
capacity to cope and impending or current disability
[11]. Frailty is considered by some to exist independently
with its own pathophysiology [12], but others describe it
as accelerated aging or an accumulation of age related
deficits [13]. Symptoms of frailty may be present in any
age group [14, 15], although are perhaps more prevalent
in the older adult that is exposed to a natural decline in
physical and psychological function.
The advance in modern medicine is a major contribu￾tory factor to people living longer, and an overall increase
in the elderly population. This increasing number of older
adults, combined with the fact that older age brings aug￾mented comorbidities, will inevitably lead to a greater in￾cidence of frailty and subsequent heightened surgical risk.
Stresses to the patient undergoing cardiac surgery are well
documented and despite ever improving medical care,
post-operative medical complications are more frequent
in the older population. These include increased hospital
length of stay (LOS), decreased physical function and de￾creased health related quality of life (HRQOL). There is a
need for alternative or additional approaches, for optimis￾ing physical function and post-operative recovery. Pre￾operative rehabilitation is a concept which has been
extensively studied within the orthopaedic population and
has demonstrated significant reduction in the need for
post-operative rehabilitation [16]. Meta-analyses of studies
investigating pre-operative exercise in patients with lung
cancer shows significant increase in pulmonary function
with positive increases in exercise capacity [17]. Currently,
within the cardiac population there is limited research
about the use of preoperative rehabilitation. The studies
typically concentrate on cardiopulmonary outcomes and
the utilisation of respiratory physical therapy as an inter￾vention. These interventions have resulted in some reduc￾tion in post-operative complications, and decreased
hospital LOS [18]. A study by Arthur et al., [19] investi￾gated the use of group exercise in patients awaiting CABG
and demonstrated a significant decrease in hospital length
of stay, increases in health related quality of life and im￾proved recruitment to cardiac rehabilitation. These studies
included patients that were physically able to travel and at￾tend group exercise sessions, an intervention that frail
patients, who are awaiting cardiac surgery would find diffi￾cult to engage with. A recent meta-analysis conducted by
Jolly et al., has shown that home-based post-operative car￾diac rehabilitation is as effective as hospital-based rehabili￾tation [20]. To date, no studies have evaluated the use of
home-based pre-operative exercise rehabilitation for frail
patients awaiting cardiac surgery.
The early preoperative assessment is a fundamental ex￾change of information between health care professionals,
patients and their families. It provides an opportunity for
both sides to evaluate the level of surgical risk, discuss
prospective surgical and patient-based outcomes. Early
preoperative assessment may also be an ideal opportunity
to identify modifiable risk factors such as frailty. The time
spent waiting for cardiac surgery to be scheduled, is a
period of great uncertainty for a patient. There appears to
be heightened anxiety regarding the inclusion of physical
activity in this time period, mainly as a result of their
current cardiac condition or diagnosis [21]. A lack of en￾gagement with any physical activity or planned exercise
training, coupled with increasing levels of sedentary be￾haviour, can lead to physical deconditioning and an in￾creased level of frailty. The timely identification of an
increased level of frailty at the early preoperative assess￾ment, may provide a unique opportunity to engage pa￾tients with a tailored intervention during the surgery wait
time (typically 6 weeks), enabling a preoperative optimisa￾tion of functional ability, confidence, motivation and a
reduced probability of post-operative complications. This
exploratory clinical intervention was designed as a clinical
pilot study to assess a clinical Pre-operative Rehabilitation
(PREHAB) home-based exercise programme, to optimise
pre-operative physical function and frailty in patients
awaiting elective Coronary Artery By-Pass Graft (CABG)
or Valve surgery.

Methods
Study design
A prospective, single-centre exploratory clinical pilot de￾signed to assess and treat patients identified as frail who
have been listed for elective Cardiac Artery Bypass Graft
(CABG) or Valve Surgery (VS). The pilot study aimed to
explore the use of a pre-surgical rehabilitation ‘PREHAB’
intervention, in the form of home-based exercise ther￾apy, with the intention to optimise pre-surgical physical
function.
Patients
Patients seen in early preoperative assessment clinics
were voluntarily enrolled into the prehab programme
when listed for cardiac surgery. The inclusion criteria for
the programme included those aged ≥65 years, undergo￾ing elective Surgery for CABG, Valve repair/replacement
(via sternotomy), Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implant￾ation (TAVI) and patients with an estimated ≥6 week
surgical waiting list time. Participants were excluded if
they required emergent surgery (Surgery for which there
should be no delay due to ongoing refractory cardiac
compromise), clinical instability, decompensated heart
failure not yet stabilised, and any acute process causing
significant symptoms or abnormal vital signs.
Outcomes and assessments.
The main aim of this clinical pilot was to explore the poten￾tial for creating a PREHAB intervention for those patients
who were frail, and awaiting cardiac surgery. Patient post￾surgical length of stay (LOS) was measured by the number
of days from their date of surgery to the date of their dis￾charge home from hospital. Functional capacity was
assessed using 3 independent measures including, the Duke
Activity Status Index (DASI) [22], the Short Physical Per￾formance Battery Protocol (SPPB) [23] and the 6 min walk
test (6MWT) [24]. The DASI is a self-administered ques￾tionnaire that measures a patient’s functional capacity. The
SPPB is a test designed to measure a patient’s functional sta￾tus and physical performance and consists of a 3-stage
balance assessment, a walking speed measure and an assess￾ment of lower limb functional strength. The 6MWT is a
submaximal exercise test to measure cardiorespiratory fit￾ness and functional capacity. Heart rate and oxygen satur￾ation was monitored throughout the 6MWT. Patient
anxiety and depression levels were scored with the Hospital
anxiety and depression scale (HADS) [25]. Body mass index
(BMI) was measured in line with the formula weight (kg) /
height2 (m2
). Patient Frailty status was assessed using the
clinical frailty scale (CFS) with its 9 point measure ‘very fit’
to ‘terminally ill’ as seen in Fig. 1, [26]. All outcome mea￾sures were assessed at baseline, and again at pre-assessment
clinic. Patient agreement to engage with a post-surgical car￾diac rehabilitation programme was also recorded. An
anonymised patient satisfaction questionnaire was provided
for patients to evaluate their experience and understanding
of the PREHAB intervention.
‘Prehab’ intervention
Following completion of all baseline outcome measures, a
prehab exercise intervention was individually tailored by a
specialist physiotherapist for each patient. All exercises
were demonstrated and observed in the hospital setting,
prior to patients initiating their home programme. The
exercise prescription was adapted for patients of differing
physical abilities and needs. Balance and strength-training
exercises, with progressive levels were modelled and de￾veloped from the ‘Otago exercise programme to prevent
falls in older people’ [27]. This is shown in Table 1 (bal￾ance exercise prescription) and Table 2 (Strength exercise
prescription). Patients were encouraged to self-monitor
their levels of exercise intensity using the rating of per￾ceived exertion scale (RPE) [28] and were given an indi￾vidual level at which to exercise, which was dependent on
their current cardiac status, symptoms and comorbidities.
Progression of strength-training exercises was determined
by patient reported reduction in RPE level for ≥1 week or
≥3 sessions without any exacerbation of cardiac symp￾toms. Balance exercise levels were progressed based on
patients self-reported ability to safely complete those at
their current level. Patients were encouraged to keep a
home exercise diary and report any problems, such as
pain or discomfort, so that they could be appropriately ad￾vised with any necessary exercise alterations instigated.
During telephone consultations, patients would be en￾couraged, and commended on their efforts.
Statistical analysis
SPSS version 20 was utilised for all analyses. Descriptive
statistics, comprising of mean (SD), were used to define
baseline and post intervention results. Paired sample t￾Tests were performed to examine pre and post-test differ￾ences in CFS, weight, BMI, HADS, DASI, SPPB and
6MWT. Pearson’s rank correlation was used to examine
associations between frailty, functional capacity and hos￾pital LOS.
Results
Twenty two patients, out of a total number of 36 pa￾tients seen in the early pre-operative assessment clinic
between March 2016 and August 2016, participated in
the prehab clinical pilot study. 90% of patients (n = 20)
completed their prescribed exercises 3×/week prior to
surgery, with a total of 15 patients attending the surgical
pre-assessment appointment prior to surgery. No ad￾verse events or cardiac symptoms were reported as a
result of the home exercise intervention. The pre-post
intervention results are shown in Table 3.
Waite et al. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2017) 12:91 Page 3 of 7

Paired t-Test analyses revealed a significant mean dif￾ference in CFS of −0.53 ± 0.51 (95% CI [−0.774, −0.279],
P = 0.0003). Significant mean difference in 6MWT dis￾tance of 42.5 ± 27.8 m (95% CI [23.840, 61.251],
P = 0.0005), 6MWT walking speed of 0.5 ± 0.4kmh (95%
CI, [0.2433, 0.7567], P = 0.001), and SPPB total score of
2.2 ± 1.7, (95% CI [3.066, 1.200], P = 0.0002) were also
observed. The change in 6MWT distance was shown to
be significantly associated with hospital LOS (r = 0.7;
P = 0.03). Patients improved their physical function
(SPPB 30%, 6MWT 18%) and showed reduction in the
CFS (18%). Hospital LOS was not shown to be signifi￾cantly associated with a reduction in CFS. Despite an in￾crease in physical function, there was no significant
reduction in BMI. BMI was able to be maintained in the
time period (0.3% increase in mean body weight). Mean
scores of anxiety and depression showed a non￾significant improvement of 2.7% & 8.5% following the
intervention. Mean hospital LOS was 8.9 days. Three pa￾tients in the sample endured a prolonged LOS due to
unforeseen surgical complications that were unrelated to
frailty or physical function. No patient discharges were
delayed due to physical or functional ability, and when
the 3 patients with unrelated complications were re￾moved from analyses, mean LOS was 5.8 days. 100% of
patients were discharged back to their own home, with
only 1 requiring an initial package of care for assistance
with domestic tasks. 100% of participants were offered
Cardiac Rehabilitation, and there was a subsequent up￾take of 82%.

Discussion
As an exploratory study, great importance was placed on
constant re-evaluation, examining the design and proced￾ural elements at regular intervals, considering any required
changes in its template and structure. This re-evaluation
promptly identified a low number of referrals from the
surgical clinic, with further analysis indicating the primary
reason for exclusion (55%) to be patients having to be
≥65 years of age. This specific exclusion criteria was set to
identify the more frail patients and recruit a manageable
quantity of patients. It was subsequently amended to en￾able frail patients to be referred regardless of age. This
change highlighted the fact that the traits of frailty can be
prevalent at varying ages [14]. As well as using this time to
collect baseline information and prescribe individually spe￾cific interventions, patients had the opportunity to gain
greater understanding of their pending surgery. The ma￾jority of patients referred for surgery reported a physical or
psychological decline in the time leading up to their surgi￾cal clinic and admitted to having slowed down or reduced

the amount of activity they were now doing. The amount
or rate of decline was understandably variable from patient
to patient. However, in the majority of patients this was a
rapid and significant decline leading to changes in their
lifestyle. It also brought about forced adaptions in the ac￾tivities of daily living, for both the patient and those
around them, comparable to previous findings [8]. This
self-realisation of decline may have been a contributory
factor as to why so many of the enrolled patients were
willing to follow the exercise intervention so rigorously.
Using an anonymous patient feedback questionnaire, 90%
of patients recruited to the study reported to complete the
rehabilitation exercises ≥3 times per week. Similar research
has reported both positive [29] and inconsistent [19] levels
of adherence, however there are no previous comparable
studies in a frail population using an independent home
based exercise as their intervention. This study demon￾strated that significant improvements in functional ability
and exercise capacity were achievable in those patients
who completed the home-based Prehab programme, al￾though patients’ overall perceived ability, measured with
the DASI, only demonstrated a minimal improvement. A
single patient was identified to have anxiety and depres￾sion scores with the need for referral to clinical Psych￾ology. Whilst there was no statistically significant change in
HADS score post-intervention within this small sample, it
is perhaps understandable that anxiety would remain high
within a cohort of patients awaiting cardiac surgery, and
this has certainly been seen in previous studies [19, 30].
Whilst this study demonstrates that it is feasible to
implement a home-based exercise intervention within
a clinical real-world setting, a randomised controlled
trial is warranted to assess the effect of this novel
intervention. This exploratory study has several limi￾tations. Adherence to the exercise intervention was
self-reported by participants and there was a varying
intervention time that was dependent on wait times
between early pre-operative clinic and surgery.
Conclusion
This small exploratory study suggests that providing a
real-world clinical home-based PREHAB programme for
frail patients undergoing CABG or Valve surgery is feas￾ible, and has the potential to improve functional ability
and reduce hospital length of stay for those patients
undergoing cardiac surgery. A frailty score with greater
sensitivity may be required to elucidate the influence
frailty could have in reducing length of stay. A large
randomised controlled study is required to reveal the
potential beneficial effects of PREHAB in this patient
population.
