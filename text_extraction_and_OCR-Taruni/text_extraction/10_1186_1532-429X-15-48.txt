Abstract
Background: The late cardiotoxic effects of anthracycline chemotherapy influence morbidity and mortality in the
growing population of childhood cancer survivors. Even with lower anthracycline doses, evidence of adverse
cardiac remodeling and reduced exercise capacity exist. We aim to examine the relationship between cardiac
structure, function and cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) tissue characteristics with chemotherapy dose and
exercise capacity in childhood cancer survivors.
Methods: Thirty patients (15 ± 3 years), at least 2 years following anthracycline treatment, underwent CMR,
echocardiography, and cardiopulmonary exercise testing (peak VO2). CMR measured ventricular function, mass, T1
and T2 values, and myocardial extracellular volume fraction, ECV, a measure of diffuse fibrosis based on changes in
myocardial T1 values pre- and post-gadolinium. Cardiac function was also assessed with conventional and speckle
tracking echocardiography.
Results: Patients had normal LVEF (59 ± 7%) but peak VO2 was 17% lower than age-predicted normal values and
were correlated with anthracycline dose (r = −0.49). Increased ECV correlated with decreased mass/volume ratio
(r = −0.64), decreased LV wall thickness/height ratio (r = −0.72), lower peak VO2(r = −0.52), and higher cumulative
dose (r = 0.40). Echocardiographic measures of systolic and diastolic function were reduced compared to normal
values (p < 0.01), but had no relation to ECV, peak VO2 or cumulative dose.
Conclusions: Myocardial T1 and ECV were found to be early tissue markers of ventricular remodeling that may
represent diffuse fibrosis in children with normal ejection fraction post anthracycline therapy, and are related to
cumulative dose, exercise capacity and myocardial wall thinning.

Background
Despite the effectiveness of anthracycline chemotherapy,
cardiotoxicity remains a significant long-term secondary
effect. The myofibrillar loss and cellular necrosis from
anthracycline cardiotoxicity leads to delayed and irre￾versible myocardial damage, culminating in cardiac dys￾function, cardiomyopathy and heart failure [1-3].
Current protocols reduce the maximum cumulative
anthracycline dose to <400 mg/m2
, but despite lower
doses, patients are still at risk of ‘subclinical’ myocardial
damage, i.e. prior to the development of clinical signs
and symptoms [4]. The severity of cardiac dysfunction
increases with the length of follow up, placing children
at increased risk of myocardial dysfunction, and making
the need for long-term monitoring in children more im￾portant [4]. Because of marked individual variation in
cardiotoxicity, there is a need for a reliable and non￾invasive method of early detection and serial monitoring
for cardiotoxicity [2]. This may then guide early manage￾ment and medical therapy in attempt to delay the onset
of clinical cardiotoxicity.
Current oncology guidelines for the follow up of
anthracycline chemotherapy are based on global indices
of LV systolic function such as fractional shortening or
ejection fraction (EF) [5]. Modern functional parameters
such as speckle tracking echocardiography (STE) to
measure strain and strain rate (SR) have been shown to
be more sensitive than conventional functional parame￾ters to detect early ventricular dysfunction in patients
after cardiotoxic chemotherapy [6-9]. However, func￾tional metrics alone provide limited insight into the
underlying myocardial damage. Cardiovascular magnetic
resonance (CMR) has the ability to characterize myocar￾dial tissue using T1 and T2 mapping techniques. Quanti￾tative T1 imaging, in particular, can be used to calculate
the myocardial extracellular volume fraction (ECV), a
measure of microscopic myocardial remodeling that has
been associated with underlying diffuse fibrosis [10]. The
aim of this study was to determine the CMR tissue char￾acteristics (myocardial T1, T2 and derived ECV) in sub￾clinical myocardial toxicity and their association with LV
function and structure, exercise capacity and chemother￾apy dose in childhood and adolescent cancer survivors.
Methods
Study design
We performed a cross-sectional study of eligible patients
between 7 and 19 years, in remission for at least 2 years,
who previously received anthracycline therapy, recruited
from the Stollery Children’s Hospital Pediatric Oncology
Survivor Program. Patients with a previous history of
acute anthracycline cardiotoxicity or ventricular dys￾function were not excluded from the study. Subjects
were excluded for known congenital heart disease, usual
contraindications for CMR, inability to perform exercise
testing, or living >2 hours outside the local area. En￾rolled patients underwent CMR, echocardiography, and
exercise testing on the same day. Written informed con￾sent and assent were obtained from the parent and pa￾tient, and the study was approved by the University of
Alberta Health Research Ethics Board. As all our pa￾tients had normal renal function, the use of gadolinium
contrast agent was considered of low risk and clinically
useful in terms of the ability to detect myocardial fibro￾sis using late enhancement techniques.
CMR
CMR was performed on a 1.5 T Siemens Sonata scanner
(Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany) using a
5-element (2 anterior, 3 posterior) cardiac array coil with
end-expiratory breath-holds. Standard balanced steady￾state free precession (SSFP) short-axis cines covering the
left ventricle (LV) were obtained (echo time, TE 1.24 ms,
repetition time, TR 2.89 ms, flip angle 51°, 8 mm slice
thickness, 2 mm gap, matrix size 256 × 126, field of view
360 × 238 mm and 30 reconstructed cardiac phases).
Quantitative T2 imaging was performed in a mid￾ventricular short axis slice using a black-blood single￾shot fast spin-echo pulse sequence with images acquired
every 5th heart beat at 3 different echo times (TE 23, 54
and 84 ms, slice thickness 8 mm, acquisition matrix size
192 × 108 and field of view 360 × 270 mm) [11].
Myocardial T1 mapping was performed in a matched
mid-ventricular short axis slice using a custom
SAturation-recovery single-SHot Acquisition (SASHA)
SSFP pulse sequence, which has previously been vali￾dated with numerical simulations and phantoms, show￾ing excellent agreement with gold standard spin-echo
imaging, with no systematic errors [12,13]. For SASHA
acquisitions, single-shot images were acquired during
diastasis in sequential heartbeats, with a single non￾saturated image followed by 9 images with saturation re￾covery times (TS) spanning the interval from the QRS to
diastasis (Figure 1). Typical pulse sequence parameters:
TE 1.39 ms, TR 2.78 ms, flip angle 70°, 8 mm slice thick￾ness, matrix size 192 × 96, field of view 320 × 200 mm,
75% phase partial Fourier, and TS 82–720 ms for a heart
rate of 60 bpm. T1 maps were acquired at baseline and
15 minutes after a bolus injection of 0.125 mmol/kg
gadopentetatedimeglumine (Magnevist, Bayer Inc., Toronto,
Canada). Conventional late gadolinium enhancement im￾aging was performed 7 minutes after contrast injection
using a phase sensitive inversion recovery (PSIR) sequence
in the short-axis, 2-, 3-, and 4-chamber views.
CMR image processing
Quantification of left ventricular end-systolic (LVESV)
and end-diastolic (LVEDV) volumes and mass were

performed using cmr42 (Circle Cardiovascular Imaging,
Calgary, Canada) to calculate LV ejection fraction,
LVEF = (LVEDV-LVESV)/LVEDV. Papillary muscles were
included in the left ventricular cavity. Mass and volumes
were indexed to body surface area, while average wall
thickness in diastole was indexed to height.
Epi- and endocardial contours were traced for T1 and
T2 analysis using custom software (MATLAB, The
MathWorks, Natick, MA, United States). The myocar￾dial region was automatically segmented into 18 circum￾ferential segments, referenced to the inferior right
ventricular insertion point, in each of which the signal
was averaged prior to fitting of signal intensity. For T2
analysis, signal intensity was fit using a Nelder-Mead
simplex direct search algorithm to a mono-exponential
decay, S = k*exp(−TE/T2), (S: signal intensity, k: a con￾stant, TE: echo-time, and T2: spin-spin relaxation time).
For T1 analysis, signal intensity was fit using a two￾stage Nelder-Mead simplex direct search algorithm to a
three-parameter mono-exponential recovery curve, S =
k*(1-η*exp(−TS/T1)), (S: signal intensity, k: a constant,
η: saturation efficiency, TS: saturation recovery times
and T1: spin–lattice relaxation time, Figure 1). A region
of interest drawn in the LV cavity was used to measure the
blood T1. In each of the 18 segments, the extracellular vol￾ume fraction (ECV), which is the volume in which gadolin￾ium contrast agent is distributed, was estimated using the
calculated concentrations of contrast agent in the blood
and tissue [10]. The contrast agent concentrations are pro￾portional to the difference in 1/T1 values from baseline to
after contrast delivery, resulting in the standard expression:
ECV = [1/T1(myocardiumpost) – 1/T1(myocardiumpre)]/
[1/T1(bloodpost) – 1/T1(bloodpre)] * (1-Hct), where Hct
was the most recent blood hematocrit [10]. The con￾trast agent was assumed to be in equilibrium between
the vascular and interstitial space by 15 minutes after
injection, at the time of post-contrast T1 measurement
[14]. All results for T2, T1 and derived ECV, are the
average values from the 18 segments.
Echocardiography
Two-dimensional echocardiography was performed using
a Vivid 7 ultrasound platform (GE Medical Systems,
Milwaukee, WI, United States). Traditional systolic and
Figure 1 SASHA T1 mapping method in a subject 15 minutes post-contrast. On each of 10 saturation recovery images, the endocardium,
epicardium and a region of interest in the blood are selected. The myocardium is automatically divided into 18 circumferential segments and T1
values are calculated in each segment by fitting a recovery curve as described in the methods. Average signal intensity in a septal segment
(white box, far right image) are shown along with a best-fit saturation recovery curve. S is the measured signal intensity normalized to the non￾saturated image intensity, η is the best-fit saturation efficiency, TS are saturation recovery times and T1 is the best fit T1 value.

diastolic functional parameters measured included:
fractional shortening (FS), peak early filling (E velocity),
late filling (A velocity), medial and lateral LV tissue
Doppler (TDI) peak systolic velocity (S’), peak early dia￾stolic velocity (E’), peak late diastolic velocity (A’), and
E/E’ ratios. The basal short axis and apical 4-chamber
views were used to obtain speckle tracking echocardi￾ography global circumferential and longitudinal strain,
and global circumferential and longitudinal strain rate
(SR) in systole and early diastole, during a breath-hold
at end-expiration. Echocardiographic measures were
analysed offline using EchoPAC software (version 7.1,
GE Medical systems, Milwaukee, Wisconsin). The
echocardiographic parameters were compared to 30
healthy normal controls of similar ages from our
existing institutional database, who had previously
undergone full functional echocardiography studies at
rest using M-mode, 2D, TDI and STE measuring the
same parameters.
Cardiopulmonary exercise testing
Incremental exercise testing with expired gas analysis
was performed on a cycle ergometer with an initial
power output of 10–15 watts, increasing by 5–10 watts
every 2 minutes according to the subject’s fitness
capacity. Heart rate was continuously monitored with
12-lead ECG, and blood pressure measured every two￾minutes with a cuff sphygmomanometer. Expired gases
were collected with a commercially available metabolic
measurement system (Parvomedics, Salt Lake City, UT,
United States). Maximum oxygen consumption, peak
VO2, was determined as the highest oxygen consumed
over a 30-second period.
Statistical analysis
A Pearson correlation (|r|) greater than 0.48 would be
detectable with 83% power assuming a 0.05 significance
level (α) and null hypothesis correlation of 0, with 30 pa￾tients. Thirty patients also achieved an effect size of 0.46
to compare CMR parameters to known reported normal
values with 80% power if α = 0.05. Assuming a standard
deviation of 10, a 4.6 unit minimum decrease compared
to normal MRI values would be detected. Power calcula￾tions were completed using PASS 2008.
Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation. Peak
VO2 was compared with healthy reported age and gen￾der matched normals [15]. Differences between patients
who participated in the study and those who declined,
were analysed using unpaired t-tests and Fisher’s exact
tests. Differences between echocardiographic parameters
of patients and controls, and gender differences in the
novel MRI parameters were analysed using unpaired
t-tests. Pearson’s product moment coefficient and linear
regression were used to compare non-contrast myocardial
T1 and ECV to continuous MRI values, anthracycline dose
and peak VO2. Gender was included as an independent
variable for all comparisons. A significance level of 0.05
was used. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS
(version 19, IBM Software Group, Somers, United States)
and S-Plus 8.0 for Windows, Insightful Corp. 2008
(Vienna, Austria, 2011, version 2.12.2).
Results
Clinical characteristics
Out of 50 eligible patients, 30 agreed to participate with the
following cancer diagnoses: 10 acute lymphocytic leukemia,
11 lymphomas (large cell, Burkitts, Hodgkins), 2 acute mye￾locytic leukemia, 2 Wilms’ tumour, 1 Ewing’s sarcoma, 2
neuroblastoma, 1 osteosarcoma, and 1 hemangiopericytoma.
The major reasons for declining to participate were the need
for intravenous access for MRI contrast administration and
unwillingness to have an MRI scan. The characteristics of pa￾tients who participated did not differ from those who de￾clined with regard to age, gender, anthracycline dose, and
previous chest irradiation as shown in Table 1. There were 3
patients who had previous acute cardiotoxicity as evidenced
by decreased LV function on echocardiography during the
acute stage, with all 3 showing normal LV function at the
time of the study. During the acute stage, 4 patients had sep￾tic events, 5 received radiation therapy, 5 received steroid
treatment, and 7 required transfusions. Patients were not
routinely screened for evidence of iron overload. Three pa￾tients received bone marrow transplantation. No patient had
cardiovascular related symptoms or cardiovascular risk fac￾tors such as hypertension, diabetes, or obesity. None of the
patients received cardioprotective agents.
Echocardiography parameters
Patients and controls used for comparison of echocardi￾ography parameters were similar in age (15.2 ± 2.7 years
versus 13.8 ± 3.4 years), gender (50% versus 57% male)
and BSA (1.57 ± 0.3 versus 1.47 ± 0.3 m2
). For conven￾tional echocardiography parameters (Table 2), FS was
significantly lower in patients compared with controls
(p < 0.01), however it remained within the normal range.
Similarly for several of the TDI parameters, there was a
significant difference between patients and controls but
with all values within the range of normal values.

Patients also showed significantly decreased circumfer￾ential and longitudinal strain, longitudinal SR, and cir￾cumferential and longitudinal diastolic SR (p < 0.01)
compared to controls (Table 3). However, these results
were within the range of normal values reported in chil￾dren [16]. There was no difference in circumferential SR
between patients and controls. There was no significant
relationship between any echocardiographic parameters
and peak VO2 or anthracycline dose.
CMR
Left ventricular EDV and EF in patients were within nor￾mal reference ranges, while LVESV was slightly larger
and LV mass slightly decreased compared to normal ref￾erence ranges reported in this age group (Table 4)
[17,18]. There was no significant relationship between
MRI-derived volumetric or functional parameters with
either exercise capacity or anthracycline dose. All pa￾tients were negative for late gadolinium enhancement.
A sample T1 saturation recovery curve from a single
segment as indicated, is shown in Figure 1. Figure 2
shows a representative example of best-fit baseline and
post-contrast myocardial and blood T1 values, with the
18 segment format shown in A) and C), and with corre￾sponding T1 pixel maps in B) and D). Figures 2E) and 2F)
show the calculated ECV for this representative example
in the18 segment and pixel map formats. Pixel formats are
shown here for illustrative purposes. Average baseline
T1 values (1155.3 ± 56.5 ms) were similar to previous
reports using the same method [12,13]. The ECV (20.7 ±
3.6%) was comparable to previous studies in younger
adults [14]. Females showed increased non-contrast T1
(1191.7 ± 50.0 ms vs 1122.8 ± 37.9 ms) and ECV (23.0 ±
3.7% vs 18.7 ± 3.1%) compared to males.
Myocardial ECV showed significant correlations with
anthracycline dose (r =0.40, p = 0.036), peak VO2 (r = −0.52,
p = 0.005), left ventricular mass/volume ratio (r = −0.64,
p < 0.001) and wall thickness/height ratio (r = −0.72,
p < 0.001) (Figure 3). Baseline myocardial T1 values
were longer in subjects with larger chemotherapy dose
(r =0.52, p = 0.052), reduced mass/volume (r = −0.54, p =
0.027), and reduced wall thickness/height ratios (r = −0.57,
p = 0.009), but did not correlate with peak VO2 (Figure 4).
Myocardial T2 values (54.6 ± 4.9 ms) were within normal
reported ranges [13,14] and were not significantly corre￾lated with T1 or ECV, mass/volume or wall thickness/
height ratios. There were no significant relationships be￾tween any of the echocardiographic parameters and ECV,
T1, or T2 values.
Cardiopulmonary exercise testing
All but 2 patients underwent exercise testing, due to
technical problems with the equipment or being too
short for the exercise bike, thus 28 patients were
exercised to peak capacity. The mean peak VO2 was

35 ± 10 ml/kg/min (83 ± 21% of predicted normal values)
and peak HR was 188 ± 17 bpm [15]. There was a signifi￾cant negative correlation between the anthracycline dose
and peak VO2 (r = −0.49, p = 0.01, Figure 5).
Discussion
Our findings show that in asymptomatic survivors of
childhood cancer with normal LVEF after anthracycline
therapy, peak VO2 is reduced and is lower in those who
received larger doses of chemotherapy. As a population,
parameters of echocardiography tissue deformation were
reduced compared to controls, but were still within the
normal range and showed no relationship to cumulative
dose or exercise capacity. In contrast, the myocardial
ECV was significantly related to exercise capacity,
anthracycline dose and ventricular remodeling. Subjects
with increased ECV had received higher cumulative
doses, had reduced exercise capacity and showed early
signs of myocardial atrophy including reduced mass/vol￾ume and reduced wall thickness. Additionally, baseline

values are shown in C) and D), as well as for the calculated extracellular volume fraction, in E) and F).

myocardial T1 values were significantly correlated with
mass/volume and wall thickness and had borderline cor￾relations with cumulative dose.
Quantitative myocardial T1 mapping, including the de￾rived ECV, are thus potential biomarkers of chemother￾apy cardiotoxicity that may have the ability to detect
signs of remodeling or tissue damage earlier than con￾ventional functional metrics. These trends, with in￾creased non-contrast T1 and ECV with suspected
pathology, are consistent with previous reports in hyper￾trophic and dilated cardiomyopathy [19,20], myocardial
infarction [21-23] and several other diseases, however, to
our knowledge, no previous T1 mapping study has evalu￾ated children. Significantly higher non-contrast myocar￾dial T1 and ECV was observed in female subjects in the
current study, similar to trends in previous T1 mapping
studies in older healthy subjects [24,25], and thus may
reflect normal gender differences. It is important to note
that a wide range of normal myocardial T1 and derived
ECV values have previously been reported, which re￾flects systematic differences in the methods. The
commonly used MOLLI (modified Look Locker inver￾sion recovery) family of pulse sequences has reported
non-contrast myocardial T1 values ranging from 939 to
1029 ms at 1.5 T [26-29]. The lower T1 values with
MOLLI as compared to SASHA are expected and reflect
the dependence of the MOLLI method on T2 values and
inversion pulse efficiency among other factors, including
the specific implementation of MOLLI [12,30,31]. A
study comparing SASHA and MOLLI yielded significant
differences in non-contrast myocardial T1 values but
similar small ranges of values, 1175 ± 27 ms and 936 ± 25
ms, respectively [12]. These systematic differences in T1
values with acquisition method also result in differences
in the calculated ECV, and thus care must be taken to in￾terpret these values in the context of the specific acquisi￾tion method.
A recent study by Neilan et al. has examined the ECV
in adults with previous anthracycline exposure, showing
an increased ECV in patients compared to controls [32].
However, their subjects were significantly older than the
subjects in the current study (55 years versus 15 years),

most subjects displayed overt signs of remodeling, in￾cluding increased ventricular and atrial volumes, and
most were on medications related to heart disease.
Similar to the Neilan study, all patients in our study
were negative for late gadolinium enhancement, which is
also in agreement with most of the literature to date. Re￾ports of late gadolinium enhancement in late anthracycline
cardiotoxicity are few, with subendocardial enhancement
being a novel finding and only reported in 2 patients, 10
and 14 years after anthracycline treatment [33]. In contrast,
diffuse interstitial myocardial fibrosis is a well-known char￾acteristic of late toxicity following anthracycline therapy
[4], and thus there is potential for increased myocardial
ECV in these patients, prior to functional abnormalities.
Lipshultz et al. observed interstitial fibrosis in myocardial
biopsy specimens in conjunction with reduced wall thick￾ness and increased wall stress [34]. Similar pathological
findings have been reported in children with doxorubicin￾induced congestive heart failure with no evidence of in￾flammation or necrosis. Goorin et al. showed mild focal
interstitial fibrosis 6–10 years after therapy, and Bernaba

hearts of adults with anthracycline-induced dilated cardio￾myopathy after heart transplantation [35,36]. Importantly,
the subjects in the current study received a wide range of
anthracycline dose, from 80 to 375 mg/m2
, and had a wide
range of peak VO2, ranging from 28 to 60 ml/kg/min, illus￾trating the broad range of potential chemotherapy toxicity
in the study population. The measurement of the correla￾tions of ECV and baseline T1 values with the cumulative
dose, as well as with morphological changes associated
with myocardial atrophy, such as reduced wall thickness
normalized to height and reduced mass/volume, was en￾abled in the current study by the wide range of values for
all measures.
CMR measures of global function and mass were
largely within the normal range in our patients. Average
myocardial T2 values in our study were also similar to
normal values from previous studies [37,38], indicating
no acute inflammation or edema, and with no correl￾ation to therapy dose or exercise capacity. In consider￾ation of factors such as the long interval since
chemotherapy, the normal myocardial T2 values, and a
lack of correlation between T2 and T1 values in our sub￾jects, it is unlikely that increased baseline T1 values ob￾served in the current study are related to edema.
The echocardiographic findings of decreased longitu￾dinal and circumferential strain, and longitudinal SR in
patients is comparable with the work of others demon￾strating reduced LV myocardial deformation parameters
as evidence of subclinical anthracycline cardiotoxicity
[7,9,39]. Consistent with the proposition of diastolic dys￾function as an earlier marker of cardiotoxicity [2,9], dia￾stolic abnormalities were observed in our patients,
including reduced E’ and A’ velocities, and diastolic SR.
Despite the many reports of echocardiographic deform￾ation parameters as potential early markers, their values
are often still within the normal range [16], as was found
in the current study, indicating that echocardiographic
parameters alone may not have sufficient ability to dis￾tinguish between normal and abnormal myocardium.
Perhaps more importantly, no significant relationship
between any echocardiographic functional parameter
and anthracycline dose or exercise capacity was ob￾served. Similarly, the echocardiographic functional pa￾rameters were not significantly correlated with any
CMR-derived parameters. It is possible that the signifi￾cant association of the CMR tissue characteristics with
factors such therapy dose and exercise capacity reflects
the closer physical relationship of the tissue status and
these factors. In contrast, the functional parameters, par￾ticularly measured at rest, are dependent on other con￾founders such as loading conditions and heart rate
which could lower their discriminatory power in terms
of underlying tissue damage.
Peak VO2 is the gold standard measure of aerobic fit￾ness [40]. De Caro et al. found that reduced peak VO2 in
patients was able to differentiate between controls and
patients post-anthracycline therapy, but that cardiac dys￾function, as measured with echocardiography at rest or
with exercise, was not significantly related to reduced
exercise capacity [41]. The significant reduction in peak
VO2 and its inverse correlation with ECV in our patients
suggests a cardiotoxic contribution to the reduced whole
body fitness. However, the potential direct toxic effects
on skeletal muscle and vascular system, occurring in
conjunction with cardiac damage, cannot be excluded
and thus the cardiac contribution to reduced peak VO2
cannot be determined. Other factors such as respiratory
or musculoskeletal function or deconditioning from a sed￾entary lifestyle following previous chronic illness may also
reduce the specificity of peak VO2 to cardiac damage [42].
Limitations
A limitation of the current study is the lack of an age￾matched control group for the CMR acquisitions. None￾theless, the strength of our findings are the significant
correlation of ECV with cumulative dose, exercise cap￾acity and structural measures of remodeling, as opposed
to their absolute values as compared to controls. An￾other limitation is the heterogeneous population of diag￾noses, radiation, and varying treatment protocols with
differing length of follow-up, which were likely import￾ant sources of variability for all findings. The study is
also limited by the lack of a comparison to a gold stand
and measure of fibrosis in subjects with exposure to
anthracyclines. Future human or animal studies would
ideally compare biopsy evaluation of myocardial micro￾structure with non-contrast T1 and ECV.
Conclusions
In children, following anthracycline therapy, myocardial
T1 values and calculated ECV correlate with cumulative
chemotherapy dose, exercise capacity and subtle struc￾tural remodeling, which may have the potential to
characterize myocardial tissue changes prior to func￾tional alterations. These novel measures of diffuse fibro￾sis may prove to be early non-invasive tissue biomarkers
of chronic anthracycline cardiotoxicity in the future.
