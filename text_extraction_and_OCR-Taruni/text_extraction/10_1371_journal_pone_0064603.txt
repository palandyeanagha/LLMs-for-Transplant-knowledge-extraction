Abstract
Introduction: The major structure elements of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) are a, b, and c sunbunits. Mutations
in c2 subunit (PRKAG2) have been associated with a cardiac syndrome including inherited ventricular preexcitation,
conduction disorder and hypertrophy mimicking hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The aim of the present study was to
identify PRKAG2 syndrome among patients presenting with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH).
Methods and Results: Nineteen unrelated subjects with unexplained LVH were clinically and genetically evaluated. Among
4 patients with bradycardia, manifestations of preexcitation were only found in a 19 year old male who also developed
congestive heart failure 3 years later. Electrophysiological study of this case identified the coexistence of an AV accessory
pathway and AV conduction defect. Histological analysis of his ventricular tissue isolated by biopsy confirmed excessive
glycogen accumulation, prominent myofibrillar disarray and interstitial fibrosis. Direct sequencing of his DNA revealed a
heterozygous mutation in PRKAG2 consisting of an A-to-G transition at nucleotide 1453 (c.1453A.G), predicting a
substitution of a glutamic acid for lysine at highly-conserved residue 485 (p.Lys485Glu, K485E), which was absent in his
unaffected family members and in 215 healthy controls. To assess the role of K485 in the structure and function of the
protein, computational modeling calculations and conservation analyses were performed. Electrostatic calculations indicate
that K485 forms a salt bridge with the conserved D248 residue in the AMPK b subunit, which is critical for proper regulation
of the enzyme, and the K485E mutant disrupts the connection.
Conclusions: Our study identifies a novel de novo PRKAG2 mutation in a young, in which progression of the disease warrants
close medical attention. It also underlines the importance of molecular screening of PRKAG2 gene in patients with
unexplained LVH, ventricular preexcitation, conduction defect, and/or early onset of heart failure.

Introduction
Unexplained left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is a common
finding, the majority of which is usually attributed to hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy (HCM), an autosomal dominant hereditary
disease caused principally by mutations in genes encoding the
sarcomeric proteins [1]. However, other disease-causing genes
have also been identified in patients with unexplained LVH, such
as the PRKAG2 gene, which encodes the AMP-activated protein
kinase (AMPK) c2 regulatory subunit [2,3]. Defects in PRKAG2
are associated with a recently described cardiac syndrome triad
consisting of familial ventricular preexcitation (Wolff-Parkinson￾White syndrome, WPW), conduction system disease and cardiac
hypertrophy mimicking HCM [4]. Histological studies of myo￾cardial tissue from affected individuals [5–7] and transgenic mice
expressing mutant forms (N488I [8], R302Q [9], R531G [10] and
T400N [11], respectively) of the PRKAG2 gene confirmed glycogen
storage as the pathologic basis for this cardiac syndrome. Because
of similar echocardiographic features, PRKAG2 disease could be
misdiagnosed as HCM. Unlike HCM, however, individuals with
the PRKAG2 mutations have a higher incidence of progressive
cardiac conduction disease requiring implantation of a pacemaker
[12,13]. It is therefore important to distinguish hypertrophy
associated with PRKAG2 mutations from that due to sarcomere

protein defects. The objective of the present study was to identify
PRKAG2 cardiac syndrome from a cohort of 19 patients with
unexplained LVH. Analysis of the clinical characteristics, ECGs,
electrophysiological study, serum biomarkers and histology
revealed one candidate with suspected PRKAG2 syndrome.
Genetic analysis confirmed the presence of a novel de novo
PRKAG2 mutation and computational modeling validates that it
could lead to severe functional changes.
Methods
Clinical Evaluations
Between 2009 and 2011, we screened all patients presentingd
with LVH at the Department of Cardiology of Tongji Hospital of
the Tongji Medical College. All patients were evaluated on the
basis of medical history, physical examination, 12-lead ECG and
transthoracic echocardiography. LVH was defined as a thickness
of the LV septal wall or the LV free wall of at least 13 mm on
echocardiography. Cardiac conduction abnormalities were classi￾fied as sinoatrial node dysfunction, atrioventricular (AV) node
conduction delay, His bundle or bundle branch block or
atrioventricular (AV) node conduction delay, His bundle or
bundle branch block, or ventricular preexcitation documented
by short PR interval (,120 ms), a widened QRS complex
(.110 ms) and a delta wave preceding the QRS. Exclusion
criteria included 1) LVH secondary to other cardiovascular
conditions including aorta or aortic valve disease; 2) isolated left
ventricular (LV) apical hypertrophy shown in a 4-chamber
echocardiographic view; 3) patients over 50 years of age in whom
the cardiac conduction system abnormality attributable to other
pathologies such as ischemic disease. The study was carried out in
accordance with institutional guidelines for human research and
approved by the ethics committee of the hospital. Informed and
written consent was obtained from study subjects. All values are
reported as Mean 6 SEM.
Echocardiography
All echocardiographic studies were conducted with a Vivid 7
Doppler ultrasonography system (GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA,
USA), equipped with a 1.7/3.4 MHz M3S transducers. The
images were acquired with the subjects at rest and lying in the
lateral decubitus position. Standard echocardiographic studies
consisted of M-mode, cross-sectional, and Doppler blood flow
measurements as previously described [14]. Cross-sectional image
were recorded from the parasternal long-axis view to measure end￾systolic diameter of left atrium, and end-diastolic diameter of LV,
septal thickness and posterior wall thickness in end-diastole. M￾mode tracings from the parasternal long-axis view were used to
measure LV ejection fraction.
Endomyocardial Biopsy and Histological Examination
Specimens of myocardium were biopsied from the right-sided
interventricular septum and fixed in formalin and paraffin
embedded before they were sectioned. Sections were evaluated
after staining with hematoxylin and eosin and Masson’s trichrome
using routine protocols. In addition, several specimens were fixed
in glutaraldehyde for transmission electron microscopy (Tec￾naiG2
12, FEI, Holland), as previously described [15].
Molecular Genetic Analysis
Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood lympho￾cytes using a commercial kit (Gentra System, Puregene, Valencia,
CA, USA). All exons and intron borders of the PRKAG2 gene were
amplified and directly sequenced from both directions using an
ABI PRISM 3100-Avant Automatic DNA Sequencer (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The sequences of the primers
used for PRKAG2 are shown in Table 1 (RefSeq NM_016203.3).
Genomic DNA from 215 healthy individuals was used as control.
Computational Modeling and Electrostatic Calculations
The coordinates of mammalian AMPK were obtained from the
protein data bank (accessation code 2V8Q) [16,17]. The wild type
structure of the regulatory domain of mammalian AMPK and the

K485E mutant was built from the existing sidechain using the
Mutator plug-in for VMD [18].
To understand the effect of the K485E mutation on the
structure of AMPK, the Poisson-Boltzmann equation was solved
analytically [19] for both the wild type and the mutant protein.
Dielectric constants of 1 and 78.54 were used for the solute and
solvent, respectively. A single ion was used as the boundary
condition and the charge was discretized using a cubic B-spline
interpolation with harmonic average smoothing applied to the
surface. The solvent radius was 1.4A, the spline window was 0.3A,
the system temperature was taken to be 298.15 K, and 129 grid
points were used in all dimensions. Sequence alignments and
comparisons were performed using BLAST to assess the conser￾vation of the residues involved in the salt bridge [20].
Results
Nineteen patients diagnosed with HCM (14 male and 5 female)
with a mean age of 3163 years of age (15 to 46 y/o at diagnosis)
were enrolled for clinical evaluation. Clinical data of all patients is
listed in Table 2. Maximal left ventricular wall thickness ranged
from 16 to 36 mm (2461 mm), and in 4 patients exceeded
30 mm. Eight patients had evidence of significant left ventricular
outflow tract obstruction as evidenced by the presence of a systolic
pressure gradient greater than 30 mmHg at rest. Fifteen of the 19
subjects presented with asymmetric hypertrophy. All subjects had
normal RA and RV values. Seventeen of 19 subjects had normal
or enhanced LV systolic function with ejection fractions of 57% or
more (70% 62%), all of which had normal LV cavity dimensions.
We identified 4 cases with bradycardia, and among them was one
displaying electrocardiographic manifestations of preexcitation, in
association with a markedly enlarged LV with impaired systolic
function, AV block, tachyarrhythmia and atrial fibrillation (AF)
with rapid ventricular rates.
Clinical Findings
The case is a 19-year-old Chinese male, initially presented with
palpitations and chest pain. He was diagnosed with HCM, WPW
and hypertension at the age of 15. The resting ECG at admission
showed sinus bradycardia (50 bpm), ventricular preexcitation and
significant LVH (Figure 1A). He experienced episodes of AF with
ventricular rates up to 214 bpm (Figure 1B) and antidromic
atrioventricular reentry tachycardia (AVRT) with a rate of
167 bpm (Figure 1C). The QRS morphology during sinus
bradycardia, AF and AVRT was similar (Figure 1), suggesting
antegrade conduction via the accessory pathway with variable
ventricular pre-excitation. Echocardiography revealed marked
concentric LVH (septal thickness of 31 mm and posterior wall
thickness of 32 mm) without signs of resting left ventricular outflow
tract obstruction, an enlarged left atrium (diameter, 45 mm) and
left ventricle (end-diastolic diameter, 65 mm), a left ventricular
ejection fraction of 46% with mild left ventricular wall diffused
hypokinesia and a small pericardial effusion (Figure 2). The right
side of the heart was normal in size and function. Serum
biomarkers for liver function were normal (ALT 38 U/L, AST
32 U/L, CK 96 U/L).
Electrophysiologic study revealed an atrioventricular accessory
pathway in the anteroseptal region. Given an increased risk of
progression into ventricular fibrillation and sudden death in
patients with preexcited AF, radiofrequency catheter ablation
(RFCA) of the bypass was attempted. Radiofrequency energy was
delivered at the site with the earliest ventricular activation.
Immediately (3 seconds) after radiofrequency energy delivery, the
patient experienced transient complete AV block without ventric￾ular escape rhythm. Finally, a permanent dual-chamber pace￾maker was implanted. The patient became completely pacemaker
dependent. Severe sinoatrial node dysfunction was confirmed by
the fact that absence of spontaneous rhythm was recorded on
ECG when his pacemaker was temporarily programmed to a rate
of 40 bpm. Furthermore, because accessory pathway conduction
remained in this patient, a second ablation procedure was
performed to eliminate recurrent pre-excitation. An AV accessory
pathway at a site close to the originally ablated pathway was
detected. RFCA successfully eliminated the pathway conduction.
Subsequent echocardiography showed no obvious change of
cardiac structure and function compared to his initial presentation.
The chest X-ray showed severe cardiac enlargement with a
cardiothoracic rate over 70% (Figure 3). Over a 3-year follow-up
period, the proband took amiodarone (200 mg daily) and
perindopril (4 mg daily) and no recurrences of AF were detected.
The patient experienced progressive deterioration of cardiac
function with intermittent dyspnea on exertion and orthopnea,
which can be alleviated by oral administration of digoxin
(0.125 mg daily) and DHCT (25 mg every 12 hours). More
recently, he suffered from pulmonary edema and acute congestive
heart failure induced by pneumonia, and is awaiting cardiac
transplantation.
The proband’s father, 60 y/o, with normal blood pressure and
no medical history of cardiovascular diseases, exhibited a resting
ECG showing sinus bradycardia (56 bpm) and increased LV
voltage. Echocardiography exhibited mildly dilated left atrium
(diameter, 38 mm) and LV (end-diastolic diameter, 53 mm) and
widening of the proximal ascending aorta (diameter, 42 mm)
without cardiac hypertrophy. His mother and brother are
asymptomatic and negative for all clinical exams.
Histopathological Analysis
Light microscopy evaluation of the proband’s heart tissue
obtained by biopsy revealed marked enlargement of myocytes with
profound intracellular vacuolation, pleomorphism of nuclei
(Figure 4A), loss of the normal parallel arrangement, frequent
side-to-side connections (Figure 4B), and increased interstitial
fibrosis (Figure 4C). Electron microscopy confirmed significant loss
of myofibrils and myofibrillar disarray (Figure 4D). Markedly
increased glycogen content was found in the interfibrillar,
perinuclear and subsarcolemmal regions of cardiac myocytes
(Figure 4E). There were no obvious mitochondrial morphological
changes, but the number of mitochondria increased significantly,
and clustered mitochondria showed the characteristic of regional
accumulation (Figure 4D). No crystal formation was detected in
mitochondria. Electron-lucent droplets of various sizes, suggestive
of lipid, were frequently observed. Occasionally, large accumula￾tions of lipofuscin were found in partial cells. In minority cells,
there were irregular empty areas between myofibrils with the
presence of scattered glycogen and mitochondria, which may be
due to dissolution of glycogen (Figure 4F). Interstitial fibrosis was
prominent and highly aggregated in partial areas (Figure 4G).
Molecular Genetics Analysis in PRKAG2 Gene
Genetic screening of the patient revealed a novel heterozygous
mutation consisting of an A-to-G transition at nucleotide 1453
(c.1453A.G) in PRKAG2 predicting a substitution of a glutamic
acid for lysine at residue 485 (p.Lys485Glu, K485E) of the AMPK
c2 subunit (K485E, Figure 5B). This mutation was not found in
reference alleles from 215 healthy controls, as well as HGMD
database (www.hgmd.cf.ac.uk) and previous publications. This
mutation was also absent in all family members, who were all
negative for the syndrome (Figure 5A). Paternity testing supported

the conclusion that the genetic variation uncovered in the proband
was a de novo mutation. We also prudently validated this mutation
by the same sequencing platform for preventing a false positive
result of de novo mutation. Alignment of the amino acid sequence of
the c2 subunit proteins showed that lysine at position 485 is highly
conserved among species (Figure 5C). Residue K485 is located at
the linker between the third and forth CBS domain (Figure 5D).
Genetic screening of the remaining 18 patients was all negative.
This mutation is predicted to be possibly damaging with a score of
0.820 by polyphen, and to be damaging with a score of 0.04 by
SIFT.
Computational Modeling Prediction
Electrostatic analysis of the mammalian AMPK protein
indicates that the lysine (K485) provides a surface of positive
charge on the c subunit, which is positioned to interact strongly
with a surface of negative charge on the b subunit around an
aspartate residue (D248). Mutation of the lysine to a glutamate
results in this positively-charged surface being replaced by a
negatively-charged surface, which will repel the negative aspartate
(Figure 6). This evidence leads to the conclusion that a salt bridge
formed between K485 and D248 plays an important role in the
regulatory mechanism of AMPK mediated by the binding of AMP
and ATP to the c subunit.
The lysine residue in the c subunit is conserved across the
AMPK family, but it is not a conserved feature in other families
that contain CBS domains (e.g. the chloride channel family and
the inosine monophosphate family), indicating that this lysine
residue is likely involved in the regulatory interaction between the
b and c subunits. Further evidence for the importance of this salt
bridge in regulation of AMPK is provided by the conservation of
the aspartate (D248) in the b subunit of the AMPK family. This
residue is conserved in all isoforms of the AMPK protein as well as

in several members of the SNF1 family, notably Sip1, Sip2, and
Gal83.
The separation distance between the lysine and aspartate
residues directly affects the strength of the salt bridge and thus
would be anticipated to have an important role in mediating the
regulation of the protein. Evidence from crystal structures of
mammalian AMPK with a variety of ligands bound in the c
subunit [16,17], pointed to the important role of this salt bridge in
the regulatory mechanism. When the activating ligands AMP or
ADP are bound to the protein, the salt bridge is formed at a
distance of approximately 6 Angstroms; when the inhibitory ligand
Mg-ATP is bound, the salt bridge is lost as the distance between
the two residues increases to more than 9 Angstroms.

Discussion
AMPK is a highly conserved heterotrimeric protein comprised
of a catalytic a and regulatory b and c subunits. It is an important
energy-sensing enzyme that monitors cellular energy status,
maintains energy balance and functions by phosphorylation of
key enzymes in lipid metabolism, which leads to decreases in fatty
acid synthase and increases in fatty acid oxidation, and by
increasing expression and translocation of glucose transporters,
which enhances glucose uptake [21]. PRKAG2 gene, located at
7q36 [22], encodes the AMPK c2 regulatory subunit, which
comprises 4 cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) domains [23]. Each
pair of CBS sequences forms a nucleotide-binding module called
the Bateman domain. In humans, three PRKAG2 transcriptional
splice variants, encoding different isoforms, have been identified
[22,24]. Function attributed to the c2 subunit is to regulate the
AMPK activity by binding 2 molecules of either AMP or ATP in
the CBS domains [25]. AMPK is activated by AMP and inhibited
by ATP, but the homeostasis can be disrupted by disease
mutations in PRKAG2. AMPK carrying PRKAG2 mutations are
reported to have decreased affinity for ATP, causing inappropriate
baseline activation of the enzyme [23].
Since the original discovery by Blair et al [2] and Gollob et al [3]
in 2001, fourteen PRKAG2 mutations (Figure 5D), including a 3-bp
insertion and 13 missense mutations have been identified
[7,23,26–28]. Each mutation has been shown to cosegregate with
the disease phenotypes with complete penetrance. In the present
study, we identify a novel de novo PRKAG2 mutation (K485E)
between CBS3 and CBS4. This missense mutation predicts
substitution of a glutamic acid (E), a negatively charged polar
molecule, for lysine (K), a positively charged polar molecule.
Calculations of the electrostatic surface of the molecule indicate
that K485 is proximal to a negatively charged aspartate residue
(D248), forming a putative salt bridge between the b and c
subunits of AMPK. Conservation analysis indicates that both of
these residues are conserved not only in the AMPK family, but in
many members of the related SNF1 family as well, demonstrating
the importance of this salt bridge for the proper functioning of the
protein. By comparing the K485-D248 distance in crystal
structures with AMP, ADP, and Mg-ATP ligands, we have shown
that the salt bridge appears to be broken in the presence of the
inactivating ligand Mg-ATP. On the basis of these results, we
conclude that the salt bridge between K485-D248 aids in the
regulation of the enzyme by mediating communication between
the b and c subunits in a ligand-dependent manner, and K485E
will break the bond of these 2 residues. In silico prediction tools
have previously shown that, all pathogenic missense mutations
occur in or very close to the CBS domains, and all benign missense
variants occur outside the CBS domain region. The K485E
mutation discovered in this study just confirms the predetermina￾tion again.
In previous studies involving PRKAG2 defects, progression to
advanced conduction system disease was common by the fourth
decade of life [3]. However, our patient became pacemaker
dependent at the age of 22 due to severe sinus bradycardia and
complete AV block. This may be explained by the fact that the
presence of AV block is initially masked by the preexcitation and
underlying conduction through the AV node may manifest heart
block after the accessory pathway loses its ability for anterograde
conduction. However, it is noteworthy that AV node dysfunction
in our patient may be iatrogenic because of the manipulation of
catheters in the anteroseptal region.
Strikingly, our patient showed early LV dilatation and rapid
progression to heart failure. Coincidentally, Blair et al [2] also
observed in their study that there was a marked propensity
towards early cardiac dilatation in patients with PRKAG2
mutations (Leu351Ins and His383Arg) and the majority of adults
either died of heart failure or required cardiac transplantation at
an early age. However, PRKAG2 cardiac syndrome usually
progresses slowly with late ventricular dilatation, and is always

compatible with long-term survival [12]. The phenotypic disparity
may be a result of the specific effects of individual mutations on
cellular energy homeostasis and gene transcription by which some
may cause a rapid progression toward end-stage heart failure,
whereas others do not. In patients with classic HCM, evolution to
severe progressive heart failure is uncommon; furthermore, most
patients with non-obstructive HCM probably do not develop
severe progressive heart failure during their clinical course [29].
The phenotypic heterogeneity therefore may help to distinguish
these disorders.
Our histopathological studies revealed increased glycogen
content in cardiomyocytes and intracellular vacuolation which
highlight the fact that glycogen storage is the pathologic basis of
PRKAG2 syndrome. However, the unexpected characteristics were
the presence of myofibrillar disarray and interstitial fibrosis which
significantly involved in partial areas.
Both the PRKAG2 cardiac syndrome and HCM are character￾ized by cardiac hypertrophy, but myofibrillar disarray is previously
considered to be a pathological hallmark of HCM. Our results
extend the clinical spectrum of pathological presentation associ￾ated with PRKAG2 defect and suggest that PRKAG2 related
cardiomyopathy can mimic HCM on pathologic examination and
fiber disarray is not pathognomonic of typical HCM.
Our patient also had hypertension which was observed in
previous reports and speculated to be due to endothelial
dysfunction-mediated by AMPK [30]. In addition, although the
proband’s father also presented with increased LV voltage on the
resting ECG, the echocardiographic assessment did not exhibit
LVH and genetic testing for PRKAG2 was negative. We therefore
infer that degeneration with increasing age might be the cause of
the father’s cardiac abnormality according to the evidence of
nonspecific cardiac changes including sinus bradycardia, mildly
dilated LV and widening of the proximal ascending aorta.
Identification of the molecular substrate is important for
determining the appropriate strategies for management in patients
with unexplained LVH due to the different clinical courses
associated with HCM or glycogen storage diseases. Our data
demonstrate significant differences in clinical course between
patients with unexplained LVH but without electrophysiological
abnormalities and the patient with both, including early onset of
left ventricular dilatation and rapid progression of heart failure. To
date, there is no specific medication for PRKAG2 cardiac
syndrome. Lifelong follow-up of the mutation carrier is necessary
because of the high incidence rate of progressive cardiac
conduction diseases. Cardiac transplantation might be the optimal
option for patients with the last-stage of the PRKAG2 cardiac
syndrome.
Study Limitations and Conclusion
The study cohort was relatively small and our observations need
to be confirmed in studies of larger cohorts. Investigation of the
functional consequences of the PRKAG2-K485E mutation is not
available and would be most welcome in the form of studies
involving transgenic mouse models as well as in human stem cell
models. Whereas, K485E is already predicted to deleterious by
both Polyphen, SIFT, and computer modeling tool.
In summary, we identified a novel de novo PRKAG2 mutation
(K485E) in a young patient with ventricular preexcitation,
conduction defect, cardiac hypertrophy and rapid progression of
heart failure. The K485E mutant breaks the salt bridge between
the b and c subunits of AMPK and thus affects the function of the
protein. Our findings extend our knowledge of the phenotypic and
genotypic expression of PRKAG2 cardiac syndrome, highlighting
the fact that excessive glycogen storage is a hallmark of this
condition. Although the cardiomyopathic process of PRKAG2
cardiac syndrome is not caused by primary genetic defects in
cardiac structural proteins, this disease also shows fiber orientation
disorder similar to that found in HCM, which implies a need for
continued morphologic characterization of cardiomyopathy, in
conjunction with genetic testing. Preexcitation related to PRKAG2
mutations can be treated by percutaneous catheter ablation.
Clinical features can sometimes provide effective means of
distinguishing between these disorders. Patients who present with
unexplained LVH, electrophysiological abnormalities, early onset
of marked LV dilatation and heart failure without elevations of
serum CK and ALT should be suspected of PRKAG2 cardiac
syndrome. Although rare, PRKAG2 syndrome can present as a
sporadic case in which progression of the disease warrants close
medical attention.
