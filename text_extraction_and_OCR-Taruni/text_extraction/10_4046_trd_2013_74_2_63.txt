Background: Aiming to improve outcome of lung transplantation (LTx) patients, we reviewed risk factors and 
treatment practices for the LTx recipients who experienced respiratory infection in the late post-LTx period (＞1 
month after LTx).
Methods: We analyzed the clinical data of 48 recipients and donors from 61 LTx, who experienced late respiratory 
infections. Late respiratory infections were classified according to the etiology, time of occurrence, and frequency 
of donor-to-host transmission or colonization of the recipient prior to transplantation.
Results: During the period of observation, 42 episodes of respiratory infections occurred. The organisms most 
frequently involved were gram (−) bacteria: Acinetobacter baumannii (n=13, 31.0%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa
(n=7, 16.7%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=4, 10.0%). Among the 42 episodes recorded, 14 occurred in the late 
post-LTx period. These were bacterial (n=6, 42.9%), fungal (n=2, 14.3%), viral (n=4, 28.5%), and mycobacterial 
(n=2, 14.3%) infections. Of 6 bacterial infections, 2 were from multidrug-resistant (MDR) A. baumannii and one 
from each of MDR P. aeruginosa, extended spectrum β-lactamase (＋) K. pneumoniae, methicillin-resistant 
Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Infection-related death occurred in 6 of the 14 episodes 
(43%).
Conclusion: Although the frequency of respiratory infection decreased sharply in the late post-LTx period, 
respiratory infection was still a major cause of mortality. Gram (−) MDR bacteria were the agents most commonly 
identified in these infections.

Introduction
 Since the first human lung transplantation (LTx) in 
1963, significant progress has been made in this field. 
From the registry of the International Society for Heart 
and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT), 3519 LTx for end￾stage lung disease were performed in 2010. The median 
survival for LTx recipients, however, is 5.5 years, dis￾appointing compared to that of other solid organ recipi￾ents1
.
 Morbidity and mortality throughout the post-LTx peri￾od result primarily from infection2-5; respiratory in￾fections including pneumonia account for approx￾imately 35% of deaths in the first year6
. Among solid 
organ transplant recipients, LTx recipients are most sus￾ceptible to infection. Several factors unique to the lung 
may explain this. First, denervation of the allograft de￾creases mucociliary clearance and the cough reflex. 
Adding to the risks of generalized immunosuppression, 
the lung is the only allograft continuously exposed to 
the environment, donor-to-host transmission, and micro￾organisms colonizing the upper airways7
.
 The various etiologies of respiratory infection in LTx

patients include opportunistic, hospital- and commun￾ity-acquired microorganisms, which differ during the 
time to occurrence. Donor-to-host transmission is one 
of important risk factors in early respiratory infection 
following LTx7
.
 In the late post-LTx period (＞1 month after LTx), 
the incidence of infectious episodes decreases mark￾edly, despite patients returning to their normal activities 
at home or work. However, in this late phase, respira￾tory infection still presents a potentially fatal risk. Better 
understanding of post-transplantation susceptibility and 
of patterns of infectious exposure in the patient's envi￾ronment is urgently required to avert this risk.
 The aim of this study is to evaluate the epidemiology 
of respiratory infection in LTx recipients at our center. 
In particular, we analyzed the time to occurrence of in￾fection, colonization of the recipient with a relevant in￾fectious agent, donor-to-host transmission of these 
agents, and the relationship of late-phase respiratory in￾fection to mortality.
Materials and Methods
 We analyzed the medical records of 48 LTx recipients 
treated at our institution between January 2006 and June 
2012 for demographic data, primary respiratory disease, 
microbiological testing before and after transplantation, 
and episodes of infection throughout the post-trans￾plantation observation period. This study was reviewed 
and approved by Institutional Review Board at Gang￾nam Severance Hospital, Yonsei University College of 
Medicine (IRB no. 3-2012-0223).
1. Pre-transplant screening
 Before LTx, sputum samples were cultured for bac￾teria and fungi, and broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) flu￾ids from recipient was analyzed by fibrobronchoscopy. 
Pre-transplant evaluations also included serology for cy￾tomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus, hepatitis A, B 
and C, herpes virus, and human immunodeficiency 
virus. 
2. Antimicrobial prophylaxis
 Postoperative antimicrobial prophylaxis was guided 
by culture from donor and recipient. For the patients 
without known colonization, antibacterial prophylaxis 
was given as either a single agent, piperacillin-tazobac￾tam or a combination of ceftriaxone, isepamicin and 
metronidazole. Systemic antimicrobial drugs were ad￾ministered for 7 days if surveillance culture from donor 
and recipient were both negative. If the cultures were 
positive, antibacterial prophylaxis was maintained for at 
least 2 weeks as indicated by the antibiogram. All pa￾tients underwent prophylaxis for fungi with fluconazole 
daily for one year and for Pneumocystis jirovecii in￾fection with sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim. Based on 
CMV serology, patients at high and moderate risk for 
CMV infection (recipient [−]/donor [＋] and recipient 
[＋]/donor [＋ or −], respectively) were maintained 
prophylactically with intravenous ganciclovir for two 
weeks, followed by oral valganciclovir for up to 6 
months or one year.
3. Immunosuppressive therapy
 Methylprednisolone was used to induce immuno￾suppression and was followed by maintenance therapy 
with steroids, calcineurin inhibitor and an antimeta￾bolite. Maintenance immunosuppressive drugs consisted 
of prednisone, tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil. 
4. Post-transplant surveillance
 Post-transplant evaluation included pulmonary func￾tion tests, imaging, periodic sputum cultures, and CMV 
antigenemia testing. If respiratory infection or rejection 
was suspected, the patient underwent a chest computed 
tomography scan, fibrobronchoscopy with alveolar lav￾age for bacterial and fungal cultures, indirect immuno￾fluorescence tests for viral and P. jirovecii infections and 
mycobacterial polymerase chain reaction, and trans￾bronchial biopsies to assess rejection and infection. 
Diagnosis of respiratory infection was made if a patient 
met any of the following criteria: fever (body temper￾ature≥37.8o
C), cough, dyspnea, purulent expectora-

Results
 Demographic data for the LTx recipients are pre￾sented in Table 1. The mean age of the patients was 
48.3 years. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis was the most 
common indication for LTx and most procedures were 
bilateral.
 The microbiological etiology was established in 42 
episodes from 48 recipient. Bacterial respiratory in￾fection (73.8%) was more frequent than fungal (11.9%) 
and viral infection (9.5%). Bacteriological isolates were 
mostly (67.7%) gram (−) bacteria: A. baumannii (n=13, 
31.0%), P. aeruginosa (n=7, 16.7%), and K. pneumo￾niae (n=4, 10.0%). Fungal infections were diagnosed in 
5 recipients, all of them caused by either Candida albi￾cans or Aspergillus species. Two cases of mycobacterial 
infection were identified, including one non-tuberculous 
mycobacterium (NTM): Mycobacterium gordonae (Table 
2). All 4 patients with viral respiratory infection were

diagnosed as CMV pneumonitis. However, no episode 
associated with CMV occurred within the first 12 months 
after transplantation. Reviewing the CMV serology, we 
found that none of the 5 high-risk mismatch recipients 
and 4 of the 37 medium-risk recipients developed CMV 
infection (Table 3).
 Among these, 7 patients (35%) were involved in do￾nor-to-host transmission and 6 occurred within one 
month after LTx. Among 48 lung recipients in this study, 
33 patients (68.8%) produced colonizing micro￾organisms in the pre-transplant BAL culture. Post-trans￾plantation respiratory infection due to pre-transplant 
colonization occurred in 4 LTx recipients, and 3 of these 
infections occurred within the first month after LTx 
(Table 4).
 Comparing most episodes (66.7%) of the respiratory 
infections occurred within the first month post-trans￾plantation, 12 patients of the 48 LTx recipients had 14 
episodes after one month. In contrast to episodes within 
the first month, in which bacterial infections predomi￾nated, late-phase infections showed diverse etiologies. 
These were bacterial (n=6, 42.9%), fungal (n=2, 14.3%), 

Tuberculosis and Respiratory Diseases Vol. 74. No. 2, Feb. 2013
67
viral (n=4, 28.5%), and mycobacterial (n=2, 14.3%). Of 
6 bacterial infections, 2 were from multidrug-resistant 
(MDR) A. baumannii and one each from MDR P. aerugi￾nosa, extended spectrum β-lactamase (＋) K. pneu￾moniae, methicillin-resistant S. aureus and S. pneumo￾niae. Among the 14 episodes of late-phase respiratory 
infection, 6 episodes (43%) resulted in death (Table 5). 
Discussion
 The most critical risks for mortality in the first month 
after LTx from infection and posttransplant complica￾tions2,8,9. Risk of respiratory infection, typically by noso￾comial organisms, is greatest in this early period. 
Prophylactic use of antibiotics reduced the risk of post￾LTx pneumonia10. When immunosuppressive therapy is 
at the highest level, opportunistic organisms such as 
CMV and fungi account for most of the respiratory 
infections. Thereafter, community-acquired bacterial and 
viral infections also develop, although infection with 
health care-associated organisms remains common11.
 In our analysis, the cumulative risk of an episode of 
respiratory infection increased sharply during the first 30 
days after transplant, when more than half of the epi￾sodes occurred, and continued to increase until it stabi￾lized. Bacterial pneumonia accounted for the largest 
proportion of infections followed by viral, fungal, and 
mycobacterial infections in the late period. Remarkably, 
most of the bacterial infections were gram (−) MDR 
and of nosocomial origin. These organisms also ac￾counted for most of the respiratory infection-related 
deaths. Thus respiratory infections induced by gram 
(−) MDR organisms may predominate over commun￾ity-acquired infection in the late period. Empiric anti￾biotic therapy in the early period after LTx is essential.
 CMV infection ranks second to bacterial pneumonia 
in incidence in the first year following LTx12,13; however, 
our data revealed no episode of CMV in this early 
period. In accordance with previous studies, we attrib￾ute this relatively low incidence of early CMV infection 
and delay in onset time to the routine prophylactic use 
of ganciclovir for up to 6 months or one year14,15. 
Recent studies report a reduction in CMV viremia and 
infection with prolonged prophylactic regimens; how￾ever, the extended prophylaxis is more likely to delay 
the onset of CMV infection than to prevent it16-19. Other 
viruses such as herpes simplex, influenza, and respira￾tory syncytial viruses may cause pneumonia in LTx re￾cipients; however, these did not appear in our study. 
In addition, prophylaxis with fluconazole at our in￾stitution proved effective in suppressing fungal infec￾tions. Previous studies show similar suppression of fun￾gal infections as a result of prophylactic strategies20-23.
 Other opportunistic microorganisms are far less com￾mon. Mycobacterial infections occur rarely after LTx and 
are typically secondary to Mycobacterium tuberculosis24. 
However, recent data show a rising incidence of NTM 
infections, particularly by M. abscessus, in 3% to 9% of 
cases25,26. Most previous data on pulmonary tuberculosis 
come from case reports or small series of patients and 
show incidence rates lower than 3%27,28. In our data, 
2 mycobacterium infections occurred in 48 LTx recip￾ients. These results agree closely with findings in other 
countries24-28, where the incidence of tuberculosis is 
much lower than in our country (80.7 episodes per 
100,000 inhabitants/yr in 2011)29.
 Data from ISHLT registry show that presence of clin￾ical infection in a donor does not significantly predict 
mortality in the recipient in the first year30. Previous 
studies including ours confirm the presence of organ￾isms in 60% to 80% of donor lungs, although these or￾ganisms very infrequently result in respiratory infec￾tions, especially in the late post-LTx period31-33.
 This study is limited primarily in the short median fol￾low-up period (338 days), small sample size and retro￾spective design. Additional observation and analysis of 
trends in respiratory infection after the first post-LTx 
year are needed. Meanwhile, prophylactic strategies 
currently in place should be continued.
 In conclusion, although antibiotic therapy has sharply 
curbed the incidence of respiratory infections following 
LTx, respiratory infection still presents a major risk for 
mortality in the late post-LTx period. Nosocomial gram 
(−) MDR bacteria were most commonly involved in
