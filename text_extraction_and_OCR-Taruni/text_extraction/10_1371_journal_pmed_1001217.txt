Abstract
Background: Few data have described long-term outcomes for infants born to HIV-infected African women taking
antiretroviral therapy (ART) in pregnancy. This is particularly true for World Health Organization (WHO)–recommended
tenofovir-containing first-line regimens, which are increasingly used and known to cause renal and bone toxicities; concerns
have been raised about potential toxicity in babies due to in utero tenofovir exposure.
Methods and Findings: Pregnancy outcome and maternal/infant ART were collected in Ugandan/Zimbabwean HIV-infected
women initiating ART during The Development of AntiRetroviral Therapy in Africa (DART) trial, which compared routine
laboratory monitoring (CD4; toxicity) versus clinically driven monitoring. Women were followed 15 January 2003 to 28
September 2009. Infant feeding, clinical status, and biochemistry/haematology results were collected in a separate infant
study. Effect of in utero ART exposure on infant growth was analysed using random effects models. 382 pregnancies
occurred in 302/1,867 (16%) women (4.4/100 woman-years [95% CI 4.0–4.9]). 226/390 (58%) outcomes were live-births, 27
(7%) stillbirths ($22 wk), and 137 (35%) terminations/miscarriages (,22 wk). Of 226 live-births, seven (3%) infants died
,2 wk from perinatal causes and there were seven (3%) congenital abnormalities, with no effect of in utero tenofovir
exposure (p.0.4). Of 219 surviving infants, 182 (83%) enrolled in the follow-up study; median (interquartile range [IQR]) age
at last visit was 25 (12–38) months. From mothers’ ART, 62/9/111 infants had no/20%–89%/$90% in utero tenofovir
exposure; most were also zidovudine/lamivudine exposed. All 172 infants tested were HIV-negative (ten untested). Only 73/
182(40%) infants were breast-fed for median 94 (IQR 75–212) days. Overall, 14 infants died at median (IQR) age 9 (3–23)
months, giving 5% 12-month mortality; six of 14 were HIV-uninfected; eight untested infants died of respiratory infection
(three), sepsis (two), burns (one), measles (one), unknown (one). During follow-up, no bone fractures were reported to have
occurred; 12/368 creatinines and seven out of 305 phosphates were grade one (16) or two (three) in 14 children with no
effect of in utero tenofovir (p.0.1). There was no evidence that in utero tenofovir affected growth after 2 years (p = 0.38).
Attained height- and weight for age were similar to general (HIV-uninfected) Ugandan populations. Study limitations
included relatively small size and lack of randomisation to maternal ART regimens.
Conclusions: Overall 1-year 5% infant mortality was similar to the 2%–4% post-neonatal mortality observed in this region.
No increase in congenital, renal, or growth abnormalities was observed with in utero tenofovir exposure. Although some
infants died untested, absence of recorded HIV infection with combination ART in pregnancy is encouraging. Detailed safety
of tenofovir for pre-exposure prophylaxis will need confirmation from longer term follow-up of larger numbers of exposed
children.

Paediatric Outcomes following In Utero Tenofovir

Introduction
Combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) is highly effective in
reducing maternal mortality, morbidity, and mother-to-child
transmission (MTCT) of HIV [1], and also allows for safe
breast-feeding [2]. However there are few systematic prospectively
collected long-term data on pregnancy rates and outcomes among
HIV-infected African women taking combination ART through￾out pregnancy for their own health or on long-term outcomes for
their exposed children. Tenofovir DF is recommended as first-line
ART in World Health Organization (WHO) 2010 guidelines [3];
its use has increased from 8% in December 2009 [4] to 19% by
December 2010 [5] and is expected to further increase. In
women of child-bearing age, future use may include pre-exposure
prophylaxis; although the FEMPREP study evaluating its ef￾fectiveness in preventing HIV acquisition from sex between men
and women was closed for futility, a more recent study found that
tenofovir-containing regimens are highly effective in preventing
HIV acquisition through heterosexual sex [6], similarly to those
exposed through sex between men [7]. Whilst data on tenofovir
use in pregnancy continue to accumulate [8], it remains a
pregnancy category B drug, indicating that more information is
needed on exposed mothers and infants [9]. This is particularly
important given concerns about potential impact on bone
mineralisation and renal impairment, delaying licensing for
children, and the high rates of pregnancy in many African
countries [10–13].
The Development of AntiRetroviral Therapy in Africa (DART)
trial was designed to investigate the impact of routine laboratory
monitoring for ART toxicity (haematology/biochemistry) and
efficacy (CD4 counts) on long-term clinical outcomes compared
to clinically driven monitoring (toxicity tests only if clinically
indicated and no CD4 counts) [14]. 65% of trial participants were
women, and three different initial ART regimens were used to
increase generalisability. During the trial period (2003–2009), the
majority of women who became pregnant were taking tenofovir￾containing combination ART before and throughout pregnancy
[11], providing an important opportunity to study pregnancy
outcomes (secondary objective) and infant outcomes (primary
objective). For the latter, a separate observational cohort substudy
was designed to follow infants born to DART mothers 2004–2009
and describe growth and development, rates of HIV infection, and
any adverse events (clinical, haematological, biochemical, and
bone related) among those exposed and not exposed to tenofovir in
utero.
Methods
Study Design, Setting, Population, and Maternal Follow￾Up
2,156 antiretroviral-naive HIV-infected women with CD4 cell
counts ,200 cells/mm3 were enrolled in the DART trial (Uganda:
Medical Research Council/Uganda Virus Research Institute
[UVRI] Uganda Research Unit on AIDS, Entebbe; Joint Clinical
Research Centre [JCRC], Kampala; and Infectious Diseases
Institute [IDI], Mulago; Zimbabwe: University of Zimbabwe,
Harare) from 15 January 2003–28 October 2004 [14], of whom
1,867 (87%) were ,45 y old (Figure 1). DART was an open
randomized trial comparing two management strategies for
monitoring ART; routine laboratory and clinical monitoring (12
weekly CD4 and haematology/biochemistry tests) versus clinically
driven monitoring (haematology/biochemistry tests only if clini￾cally indicated). Women all had negative pregnancy tests at
enrolment and started ART with zidovudine/lamivudine plus
either tenofovir (in 2003/2004), or nevirapine or abacavir (2004
only) following WHO guidelines [15]. 369 of the 2,156 women in
DART were randomised to receive nevirapine OR abacavir con￾taining first-line ART in a nested randomised placebo-controlled
toxicity substudy (NORA) in Uganda (placebo-controlled for
24 wk only; then open-label) [16]; remaining participants received
tenofovir- or nevirapine-containing first-line ART (open-label and
non-randomized). The only factor influencing choice of first-line
ART was calendar year. During follow-up, women attended clinic
four-weekly and had six-monthly pregnancy tests; those who
became pregnant at any time were encouraged to seek immediate
advice. Information on all pregnancies and pregnancy outcomes,
including gestational age estimation based on last menstrual
period, congenital abnormalities, and ART taken by the mother
throughout pregnancy and the infant at birth were collected within
DART. High levels of adherence to ART were reported in DART
using pharmacy refill, pill counts, and questionnaires [14].
Outcome of pregnancy was categorised into: miscarriage or
induced termination (,22 wk); early (22–28 wk), late (.28 wk),
and intrapartum stillbirth; and live-birth. Low birth weight was
defined as ,2,500 g in an infant $37 wk. Prematurity was
defined as ,37 wk gestation.
Additional information on infants born to DART women was
collected through a separate longitudinal observational study at all
centres. Inclusion criteria were informed consent from the mother
and willingness to comply with follow-up visits. Mothers whose
child had died after the perinatal period were approached for
consent to provide retrospective information. Infants born before
November 2007 (Harare) or January–March 2008 (Uganda sites)
were enrolled retrospectively and then followed prospectively;
subsequent infants were prospectively enrolled to September 2009.
Data Sources and Infant Follow-up
Infants were followed at 2, 6, 12, 24 wk, and then 24-weekly
after birth until the mother exited DART (last information on
pregnancy outcome December 2009). For infants enrolled ret￾rospectively, data were extracted from medical records held at
DART centres, where infants were already receiving regular
follow-up care before ethics approval was obtained.
Clinical status, adverse events, infant feeding, weight, head, and
mid-upper-arm circumference (MUAC), and growth were ascer￾tained, and a neurodevelopment screen (evaluating gross/fine
motor skills, hearing, understanding, expressive language, and
social development, based on Bayley [17]) was undertaken at each
visit. Routine biochemistry (creatinine, urea, liver enzymes [AST/
ALT], sodium, potassium) and haematology (haemoglobin, MCV,
WBC, lymphocytes, neutrophils, platelets) panels were performed
in addition to urine dipsticks for protein and glucose, and blood
calcium, phosphate, and alkaline phosphatase tests where samples
were sufficient. The focus was on potential toxicities of tenofovir
(creatinine, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase, urine tests) and
cotrimoxazole or zidovudine (haemoglobin and neutrophils).
Division of AIDS (DAIDS; US National Institutes of Health
[NIH]) toxicity tables were used, with grades 1, 2, 3, and 4
defining mild, moderate, severe, and life-threatening events [18];
as neutrophils are lower in uninfected Africans, these used updated
NIH paediatric toxicity tables [19]. For toxicity grading, infants
with gestational age $37 wk were assumed to be born at ‘‘term.’’
For infants enrolled prospectively at birth, a DNA or RNA PCR
HIV test was performed at 6 wk and 12 mo. For breast-fed infants
or where breast-feeding status was unknown, this was also done at
6 mo (or end of breast-feeding). For infants enrolled after birth, a

PCR or HIV antibody test was done for those ,18 or $18 mo,
respectively, at first visit. All positive PCR tests were confirmed
with a second test.
Statistical Analysis
Data were analysed using Stata v11.0 (Stata Corporation).
Analysis of pregnancy data collected in DART was an observational
additional analysis, i.e., not by randomized group. In all analyses,
pregnancies were considered statistically independent, because
mothers were typically taking different ART in different pregnan￾cies, and because, as subsequent pregnancies were only 21% of
total, any variance adjustment would have little impact (results were
similar restricting to the first pregnancy per woman). For similar
reasons as only 3% infants were a twin, and because discordant HIV
transmission among twins is well described, multiple births to the
same mother were considered statistically independent in infant
analyses (results were similar restricting to one enrolled infant per
pregnancy). Generalised estimating equations with independent
correlation structure were used to compare adherence during
pregnancy with before/after pregnancy. Wilcoxon rank-sum tests
were used to compare continuous variables between infants with no
versus $90% in utero tenofovir exposure (tenofovir prescribed for
$90% d from the estimated start to end of pregnancy); chi-squared
and exact tests compared categorical variables. The 90% cut-off was
arbitrary but chosen in advance of data analysis; it allowed 111
infants with $90% exposure to be compared with 62 infants with no
in utero tenofovir exposure, excluding nine (5%) with 20%–89%
exposure from tenofovir comparisons (see Table 1 for other
components of the ART regimen).
Survival was estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods. Time￾dependent Cox proportional hazards models with analysis time
from birth to death or last visit were used to examine the effects of
feeding practice (currently breast-feeding versus previously breast￾fed versus never breast-fed) on infant mortality. Missing dates were
estimated as the mid-point between the last visit where current
breast-feeding was recorded and the first visit recording no breast￾feeding (n = 18), or, if breast-feeding had already stopped, as the
date of the first prospective visit (n = 1). Infants with no stop
reported were assumed to be still breast-feeding at the last visit
(n = 6, median 2 mo old, range 1–31).
The effects of no versus $90% in utero exposure to tenofovir on
growth were examined using random effects models to allow for
multiple measurements per child. z-Scores were calculated using
‘‘WHO Child Growth for 0–5 year olds’’ guidelines [20]; these
relate observed growth parameters (height, weight, MUAC, and
head circumference) to those expected in normal children
according to percentiles. Thus a z-score of 0 indicates expected
growth for age, and 2/+1.96 indicates that growth is at the 2.5th
or 97.5th percentile of that expected for age respectively. z-Scores
,26 (indicating severe impairment) were truncated at 26 (12
measurements only). Separate random effects models were fitted
for four growth parameters: weight and head circumference z￾scores from birth, MUAC z-scores from 12 wk, and height z￾scores from 48 wk (due to measurement difficulties before this
age). Changes in the speed of growth from birth (non-linearity)
were investigated by profile log-likelihoods allowing two different
initial and subsequent growth rates, changing at successive visit
weeks; the maximum log-likelihood was used to estimate the
timepoint where growth rate changed that was best supported by
the data. Random effects were included for baseline value, initial,
and subsequent slopes with an unstructured covariance matrix
(except for MUAC and height where only overall slope random
effects were used due to non-convergence of the full model).
Ethical Considerations
Both the DART trial and the separate infant follow-up study
(with separate protocol) were approved by Ethics Committees in
Uganda, Zimbabwe and the UK.
Results
1,867 women aged ,45 y initiated ART in DART. During
median follow-up of 5.1 y, there were 382 pregnancies in 302
(16%) women (Figure 1), an incidence of 4.4/00 woman-years
(95% CI 4.0–4.9). 357 (93%) pregnancies occurred on first-line
ART. As expected, pregnancy rates were highest in younger
women (9.9 [8.6–11.5], 5.2 [4.4–6.1], and 1.8 [1.4–2.4] per 100
woman-years in women aged 18–29, 30–34, and 35–39 y at ART
initiation, respectively; p,0.0001 adjusted for pre-ART CD4,
centre, and years on ART). Pregnancy rates were also higher in
rural Entebbe (adjusted risk ratio = 1.35 versus the main urban
Kampala centre [48 km away] [1.06–1.73]; p= 0.02).
The 382 pregnancies resulted in 390 outcomes (including
multiple births): 226 (58%) live-births, 137 (35%) miscarriages/
terminations (75 [55%] reported as spontaneous, 62 [45%] as
induced), and 27 (7%) stillbirths (Figure 1). There was marginal
evidence of a decreasing proportion of miscarriages/terminations
and stillbirths with increasing time since ART initiation (p= 0.06).
There was no significant difference in the distribution of
miscarriages/terminations, stillbirths, and live-births between
women not on tenofovir versus those on tenofovir for $90% of
their pregnancies (Figure 1, exact p= 0.19). 9.5% of 2,511 four￾weekly adherence questionnaires completed during pregnancy
reported missing one or more ART doses in the last month,
compared to 9.9% in 16,246 questionnaires from the same women
whilst they were not pregnant (p= 0.79). Four women died, two
during pregnancy (severe malaria, septic abortion) and two at
delivery (post partum haemorrhage, unknown cause).
The 226 live infants born between June 2004 and December
2009 were eligible for inclusion in the infant follow-up study
(Figure 1). There were seven out of 226 (3%) live-births with
congenital abnormalities: three out of 72 (4%) with no exposure
versus four out of 141 (3%) with $90% in utero tenofovir exposure
(exact p= 0.69) (Figure 1). (None of the stillbirths had congenital
abnormalities reported). 22/225 (10%) live-births were premature
(gestational age ,37 wk) (one missing), eight of 72 (11%) with no
tenofovir in utero exposure versus 13/140 (9%) with $90%
exposure (chi-squared p= 0.67). Rates of low birth weight
(,2,500 g) were 16% (34/209) among all live-births with birth
weight recorded and 13% (25/189) among live-births with
gestational age $37 wk.13/69 (19%) with no in utero tenofovir
exposure had low birth weight compared with 19/130 (15%) with
$90% in utero tenofovir exposure (chi-squared p= 0.44).
Seven mothers of live-births were not approached for consent.
Their babies all died before 2 wk of age (six in the first day of life)
of foetal distress (three), prematurity (three), and haemorrhagic
disease (one); 1% (1/72) had no in utero tenofovir exposure versus
4% (six of 141) with $90% exposure (exact p = 0.40). Of 219

the first 3 y after ART initiation when the proportion of pregnancies ending in miscarriage/termination and stillbirth were higher and rates of live￾births were lower.

remaining eligible infants alive after 2 wk, 182 (83%) born to 152
mothers were enrolled in the follow-up study, including six pairs of
twins, and 24 second or third births (see Figure 1 for reasons for
non-enrolment). All 182 enrolled infants are included in further
analyses: 129 (71%) were enrolled retrospectively (including some
infants who had died), but clinical notes documenting regular
follow-up were available for data collection (see Table 1 for age at
enrolment). In utero tenofovir exposure was similar among 182
included and 37 excluded infants, as was centre, antiretrovirals
received at birth, gestational age, and mode of delivery (p.0.22),
although birth weight was lower for included infants (median 3 kg
[interquartile range (IQR) 2.5–3.2]) compared to those excluded
(3.2 kg [3–3.6]; p= 0.002).
Baseline Characteristics and In Utero ART Exposure
62/182 (34%) infants had no in utero tenofovir exposure and
111 (61%) had $90% exposure; nine (5%) had 20%–89%
exposure (excluded from tenofovir comparisons) (Table 1). 145
(81%) were delivered vaginally. Characteristics did not differ by in
utero tenofovir exposure (p.0.4) (Table 1).
93% women (163/176, six twins) took ART throughout
pregnancy, with only 13/176 (7%) interrupting ART for .7 d;
infants were most commonly exposed in utero to zidovudine and
lamivudine with tenofovir (54%) or nevirapine (24%). Overall
162/176 (92%) and nine out of 176 (5%) women were on first- and
second-line ART regimens, respectively, and five (3%) switched
from first- to second-line during pregnancy (Table 1). 152 (84%)
infants received anti-HIV prophylaxis, the majority with single￾dose nevirapine with or without additional short-course zidovu￾dine. Compared to those with no tenofovir exposure, more infants
with $90% in utero tenofovir exposure received single-dose
nevirapine (as recommended in the DART procedures because
this was a new drug their mothers were not taking).
The median age of infants at last visit was 25 (IQR 12–38) mo.
Infants spent a median of 12 mo (IQR 5–17) in the study with
median three (IQR 2–4) prospective clinic visits.
HIV Testing and Transmission
172 of the 182 enrolled infants had HIV tests during the study:
all were negative (latest HIV antibody and DNA PCR negative in
102 children aged $18 mo and 70 aged #18 mo, respectively).
Two infants were lost to follow-up and eight died before being
tested. The observed HIV transmission rate of 0% has an upper
one-sided 97.5% confidence limit of 2.1% excluding those not
tested. Sensitivity analyses assuming 100%, 50%, or 0% of the ten
untested infants were infected gave transmission rates of 5.4%
(95% CI 2.7%–9.9%), 2.7% (0.9%–6.3%), and 0.0% (97.5% one￾sided CI 0.0%–2.0%), respectively.
The ten untested infants were last seen at median age 12 mo
(range 2–34 mo); four died without a prospective follow-up visit, four
died after one to six follow-up visits, and two were lost after two to
three visits. Three were hospitalised for malaria, severe burns leading
to death, and respiratory infection leading to death, respectively. Last
weight-for-age z-scores (available for seven out of ten) were all above
22 except for one (23.5). Neurodevelopment of untested children
was described as normal (in clinic notes and according to more
detailed questions on clinical case report forms) in all but one infant
who at last follow-up at 24 wk could not sit unsupported.
Mortality
14/182 infants died at median (IQR) age 9 (3–23) mo, giving 6-
and 12-mo post-natal mortality of 3% and 5%, respectively (four
per 100 child-years). Six infants were HIV negative and died of
acute diarrhoea (two), malaria (one), airway obstruction (one),
severe anaemia (one), and fever (one); eight HIV-untested infants
died of respiratory infection (three), sepsis (two), burns (one),
measles (one), and unknown cause of death (one). Four out of 14
(29%) were ever breast-fed. The mortality rate in the retrospective
follow-up period was three per 100 child-years (95% CI 1–7)
compared to four per 100 (95% CI 2–9) in the prospective period
(p= 0.67). Six out of 62 (10%) with no in utero tenofovir versus
seven out of 111 (6%) with $90% exposure died (p= 0.42) (one
additional death had received 76% in utero tenofovir).

Breast-feeding
In contrast to high breast-feeding rates generally observed in
these settings, only 73 (40%) infants were ever breast-fed, for
median 94 d (IQR 75–212): 88 (53–101) versus 144 (83–320) d in
those with no tenofovir versus $90% exposure respectively
(p= 0.03); only 24 (33%) infants were breast-fed for .6 mo. The
unadjusted hazard ratio for mortality was 0.43 (95% CI 0.05–3.50)
for currently breast-fed versus never-breast-fed babies and 0.70
(95% CI 0.19–2.60) for those who had stopped breast-feeding
versus never-breast-fed (p= 0.68). Similar results were obtained
adjusting for sex, gestational age, mode of delivery, and birth
weight (unpublished data).
Adverse Events, Clinical Events, and Medication
Among 368 serum creatinine measurements in 164 children,
only 12 (3%) were abnormal (three grade 2, nine grade 1), and
hypophosphataemia occurred in only seven out of 305 (2%)
samples (all grade 1); no differences were observed between
children with no tenofovir exposure versus $90% in utero
exposure (p.0.15) (Table 2). Consecutive creatinine or phosphate
values were abnormal in only two out of 14 children, neither of
whom were exposed to tenofovir in utero. Five out of 109 children
had a single occurrence of 1+ proteinuria: one had no in utero
tenofovir and four had $90% exposure. All 112 sugar dipsticks
were negative. Low haemoglobin (n = 95, 56%), mostly grade 1
(n = 51) or grade 2 (n = 26), occurred slightly more frequently in
infants without in utero tenofovir exposure (p= 0.06), but in similar
percentages of children with no zidovudine versus .90% in utero
zidovudine exposure (14/24 [58%] versus 74/130 [57%]; p=
0.90). No bone fractures were reported to have occurred in any
child.
51 children had one or more hospitalisations (total 85
hospitalisations, maximum six per child); incidence 22 hospital￾isations (95% CI 18–28) per 100 child-years (31 [22–42] versus 18
[13–24] for those with none versus $90% in utero tenofovir
exposure respectively; p= 0.02). Nearly half (40/85, 47%) were for
malaria. Other events requiring hospitalisation included diarrhoea
(14/85, 16%), pneumonia (ten out of 85, 12%), meningitis/sepsis
(eight out of 85, 9%), and clinical anaemia (five out of 85, 6%),
with no significant differences between those with none versus
$90% in utero tenofovir exposure for any of these (p$0.13). Of 77
additional clinical events not requiring hospitalisation, 66 (86%)

were malaria and four (5%) were clinical anaemia. The unadjusted
hazard ratio for time to first hospitalisation or death was 0.44 (95%
CI 0.17–1.14) for currently breast-fed versus never-breast-fed
babies and 0.90 (95% CI 0.50–1.66) for those who had stopped
breast-feeding versus never-breast-fed (p= 0.19).
Growth
Weight and height at birth were significantly lower than average
according to WHO norms (both p,0.001) (Table 3). There was
also marginal evidence of lower than expected MUAC at 12 wk
(p= 0.06). After birth, weight, and MUAC z-scores increased
significantly to age 60 wk, remaining stable (weight for age) or
slightly decreasing (MUAC) thereafter. At 1.5 and 3 y of age,
mean weight, MUAC, and head circumference z-scores were well
within the normal range, with variability as expected in the WHO
reference population. Predicted weights and MUAC were also
similar to the median from a reference group of under 5-y-old
children in Mbarara, south-west Uganda (Table 3) [21]. In
contrast, height for age slightly decreased from week 48 to 120,
followed by moderate increases from 120 wk onward (heteroge￾neity p= 0.004). The net effect of these changes was that children
remained significantly stunted at 1.5 and 3 y according to WHO
norms (mean z-scores 22.14 and 21.32, respectively), although
predicted heights (in centimetres) were comparable to a Ugandan
reference population [21]. We found no evidence of differences
between children with no in utero tenofovir versus $90%
exposure in weight (Figure 2a), MUAC, or head circumference
for age, either initially (p.0.1) or subsequently (p.0.8). Height￾for-age z-scores were in fact lower in those with no in utero
tenofovir exposure before 2 y old (p= 0.03), but similar thereafter
(p= 0.38) (Figure 2b). This appeared to be driven by somewhat
greater height for age in those with $90% tenofovir exposure at
48 wk, which subsequently decreased slightly to match those with
no in utero tenofovir exposure by 2 y. Head circumference z-score
did not vary with age (p= 0.91).
Discussion
The goals of our study were to provide long-term information
on infants exposed to combination ART with and without
tenofovir throughout intrauterine and breast-feeding periods as a
primary objective; describing pregnancy outcomes among women
taking tenofovir for their own health was a secondary objective.
Since DART started in 2003, tenofovir has become a recom￾mended drug in first-line ART regimens in adult guidelines
worldwide [3,22–24]. With new recommendations to start ART
earlier [3,23,24], and evidence of reduced onward HIV transmis￾sion with earlier ART initiation [25], the potential that women
may conceive and/or go through pregnancy while taking tenofovir
is likely to increase. Furthermore, recent results demonstrating
effectiveness of tenofovir in preventing HIV acquisition in
serodiscordant heterosexual couples [6] mean that it is likely to
have an increasing role in preventing HIV acquisition in HIV￾uninfected women having sex with men. However, the reasons for
lack of effect in another study [26] require more investigation. The
fact that the same dose (300 mg daily) is used in PrEP and HIV
treatment suggests our results should be generalisable to both
indications.
Given advanced immunodeficiency (CD4,200 cells/mm3
) at
ART initiation in all included women, it is not surprising that we
observed somewhat lower pregnancy rates than the 9.0/100
women-years on ART recently reported from the MTCT-Plus
initiative [12]. The pregnancy rate of 4.4/100 woman-years in
DART was more similar to the rate in HIV-infected women not
on ART (6.5) in MTCT-Plus. However, our results suggest that,
on average, at least one in 20 HIV-infected women on ART was
having unprotected sex every year, and highlights the importance
of improved contraception with counselling as women’s health
improves on ART. Our miscarriage/termination rate of 35% is
higher than observed in settings without regular pregnancy testing;
but it is similar to the 42% reported in the Botswana Tschepo trial
[27]. Even higher rates (70%) were reported among HIV-infected
women enrolling in microbicide preparedness studies [28]. Whilst
around half the miscarriages/terminations were reported as
spontaneous in our study, the distinction between induced
termination and spontaneous termination/miscarriage is prob￾lematic in settings where medical termination is not legal, and may
also not have been disclosed in all DART centres. Of note, we
found no evidence that pregnancy outcome was related to use of
tenofovir in pregnancy.
Tenofovir is present at low concentrations in breastmilk [29] but
readily crosses the placenta in pregnant women on ART [30], thus
exposing infants to relatively high levels in utero. Safety issues for
tenofovir-exposed infants include concerns about congenital
abnormalities, renal function, bone mineralisation, and growth.
These concerns first arose from studies showing that high doses of
tenofovir given to pregnant Rhesus macaques caused bone
demineralisation, impaired somatic growth, and low levels of
insulin-like growth factor-1 in their infants [31–33]. Renal tubular
leak of phosphate resulted in bone demineralization and deformi￾ties in macaque infants given high dose tenofovir, although these
effects were largely reversible once tenofovir was stopped [31].
Rates of congenital abnormalities in our study are similar for
tenofovir and non-tenofovir exposed infants and to those from the
Antiretroviral Pregnancy Register (APR), which recently reported
a congenital anomaly prevalence among infants with first trimester
exposure to tenofovir of 2.4% (26 of 1,092 live births), with no
specific pattern of anomalies [8]. This is also similar to the
congenital abnormality rate in the general population, for
example, 2.7% reported in the US Centers for Disease Control’s
Congenital Defects Program 1989–2003 [34]. It is important that
African data such as those from DART continue to also be
reported to the APR, which monitors congenital abnormalities
following exposure to all antiretroviral drugs. Prematurity oc￾curring in pregnant women on ART has been attributed mainly to
protease inhibitor (PI)-based ART [35–37]; in our study, where
few women were on PIs, the prematurity rate of ,10% did not
differ by tenofovir exposure and is similar to rates reported in
women either not on ART or on non-PI–based ART in these
studies.
Despite increasing numbers of infants being exposed to
tenofovir in utero and use of off-label tenofovir in HIV-infected
children, data on its effects on renal function, bone mineralization,
and growth remain relatively sparse; in particular, few studies have
included a control group. Whilst our study was relatively small, we
had .80% power to detect absolute differences of ,20% between
tenofovir-exposed and non-exposed infants. Although not ran￾domized, we observed no evidence of increased renal impairment
or hypophosphataemia among infants exposed to tenofovir- versus
non-tenofovir–containing ART, in contrast to reports in older
HIV-infected children [38,39], including a case-control study that
reported hypophosphataemia of grade 2 or greater in ,4% UK/
Irish children receiving off-label tenofovir versus ,1% controls
[40,41]. Although abnormalities appear to normalise following
withdrawal of tenofovir [39,40], more long-term data are needed
in children receiving tenofovir from an early age, including
through adolescence. Despite best efforts, we failed to collect
sufficient urine samples for calcium/phosphate measurements in

our study and although there was no evidence of significant
proteinuria, more sensitive markers of tubular dysfunction were
not measured. An increased risk of fractures has been reported in
HIV-infected versus HIV-uninfected adults [42,43], and reduced
bone density was one of few adverse effects observed more
frequently in those continuing versus interrupting ART in the
SMART trial [44]. Reductions in bone density with tenofovir have
also been reported in some [45–47], but not all [48] studies.
Fractures have not been reported systematically from studies of
ART in children but appear to be uncommon; none were reported

in our small study. More sophisticated dual-energy x-ray
absorptiometry (DEXA) scanning is difficult in very young
children, and is also limited by lack of normative data in African
children and expense. Longer term data on bone health in both
tenofovir-exposed HIV-infected children and infants exposed to in
utero tenofovir are needed, particularly as tenofovir has recently
been licensed by the US Food and Drug Administration for
adolescents .12 y and is expected in younger children.
With respect to growth among tenofovir-exposed infants,
Nurutdinova reported one of 14 live-births to tenofovir-exposed
women to be small for gestational age [49]. The US Pediatric
HIV/AIDS Cohort Study (PHACS) of 532 infants reported lower
weight but not height at 1 y among those exposed versus not
exposed to tenofovir in utero [50], although the effect was
unrelated to duration of tenofovir exposure and was not present at
birth. The authors concluded that tenofovir should remain an
‘‘alternative’’ rather than ‘‘recommended’’ drug during pregnancy
as per current US guidelines [51]. We found no evidence of lower
birth-weights or any subsequent growth parameter up to age 4 y
among children exposed to tenofovir throughout intrauterine life
compared with unexposed children, and had .80% power to
detect differences of ,0.5 z-score units. Powis et al. observed lower
birth weights in triple (but non-tenofovir) ART compared with
zidovudine-only exposed infants in a combined analysis of nearly

Paediatric Outcomes following In Utero Tenofovir

2,000 infants in the Botswanan Mma Bana and Mashi trials [52];
as in our study there was catch-up weight gain soon after birth,
more so in the triple ART group. Despite somewhat lower height￾for-age z-scores compared to WHO norms, both weights and
heights attained among children in our study were very similar to
those reported by Cortinovis et al. in a large reference study of
over 4,000 young HIV-uninfected children in south-west Uganda
[21], demonstrating the difficulties in assessing what is ‘‘normal’’
growth for children in different geographical locations.
While the focus of this study was on evaluating possible adverse
effects of in utero exposure to tenofovir in infants, many were also
exposed to zidovudine/lamivudine. Although low-grade anaemia
was not uncommon, there was no evidence to suggest this occurred
more frequently in those with in utero zidovudine exposure.
Assessment of mitochondrial dysfunction and neurolodevelopmen￾tal outcomes is limited but no overt manifestations were observed.
In agreement with other studies of women receiving ART during
pregnancy and breast-feeding [1,2], the rate of pMTCT was low.
Although we observed no HIV-infected infants, testing for HIV
infection was not 100%. However, under the most pessimistic
assumptions about the HIV prevalence in untested infants, the
estimated pMTCT rate would still be only ,5%, despite women
having had very advanced disease (32%,50 cells/mm3 at ART
initiation). Half the women in DART received ART with clinically
driven laboratory toxicity monitoring only and no routine CD4 tests
throughout pregnancy. Our results reassure that lack of monitoring
tests should never be a barrier to providing ART to pregnant
women in resource-limited settings to effectively prevent MTCT
and for their own health. Of note, we purposely recommended that
all infants receive single dose nevirapine prophylaxis to provide
additional pMTCT ‘‘cover,’’ in case any mothers on zidovudine/
lamivudine/tenofovir were viraemic at delivery.
Despite encouragement to breast-feed, only 40% women in this
cohort did so, and then only for a short time. WHO guidelines at
the time recommended that women make their own choices about
infant feeding [53], and there was considerable pressure not to
breast-feed; if women chose to breast-feed, early weaning was
encouraged, particularly in Uganda (personal observation, P
Musoke). Mortality in our cohort was 5% by age 12 mo (3.4%
by 6 mo), not dissimilar to those of Powis et al. who reported
mortality of 2.1% by 6 mo in infants of Botswanan women taking
combination ART who all exclusively breast-fed for longer [52].
Whilst we did not find a significant association between mortality
and formula- versus breast-fed infants, likely because of lack of
power, the large effect estimate is in keeping with other African
studies [54–56], which led to revision of WHO guidelines to
encourage breast-feeding while providing antiretroviral prophy￾laxis either to the mother or the baby while breast-feeding [57], as
occurred in DART. There was marginal evidence of fewer
hospitalisations in children exposed to tenofovir in utero, although
numbers were too few to identify whether or not breast-feeding
might be the reason for this; there was certainly no evidence of
excess morbidity associated with in utero tenofovir exposure.
The main limitation of both the primary outcomes in infants
and secondary pregnancy outcomes in mothers is the relatively
small sample size. However, data on mothers receiving combina￾tion ART for their own health throughout pregnancy in resource￾limited settings remain scarce, although undoubtedly further
important information will be gathered with changes in WHO
guidelines to recommend combination ART for all pregnant
women (Option B+) [3]. The main DART trial was not designed
to investigate issues in pregnancy, and most ART was non￾randomised—comparisons of tenofovir exposure are therefore
observational rather than randomised and the possibility of bias
cannot be excluded.
In conclusion, we observed no evidence that tenofovir versus
non-tenofovir ART had any adverse effects on pregnancy out￾comes or on congenital, renal, bone, or growth abnormalities up to
age 4 y among children born to women with severe HIV
immunodeficiency at ART initiation and exposed throughout
the intrauterine period. Although some infants died untested for
HIV, the estimated MTCT rate taking the most pessimistic
scenario was ,5% and no HIV-infected babies were found. Infant
mortality was low and similar to the general population of 2%–4%
for these African countries in 2010 [58]. Our findings suggest
tenofovir-containing ART is a reasonable choice in pregnancy and
that tenofovir pre-exposure prophylaxis is also reasonable for
women who are at high risk of seroconverting during pregnancy
[59,60]; safety of tenofovir for PrEP will only be confirmed by
longer term follow-up of large numbers of exposed infants.

Editors’ Summary
Background. Currently, about 34 million people (mostly in
low- and middle-income countries) are infected with HIV, the
virus that causes AIDS. At the beginning of the epidemic,
more men than women were infected with HIV but now
about half of all people living with HIV/AIDS are women,
most of who became infected through unprotected sex with
an infected partner. In sub-Saharan Africa alone, 12 million
women are HIV-positive. Worldwide, HIV/AIDS is the leading
cause of death among women of child-bearing age.
Moreover, most of the 400,000 children who become
infected with HIV every year acquire the virus from their
mother during pregnancy or birth, or through breastfeeding,
so-called mother-to-child transmission (MTCT). Combination
antiretroviral therapy (ART)—treatment with cocktails of
powerful antiretroviral drugs—reduces HIV-related illness
and death among women, and ART given to HIV-positive
mothers during pregnancy and delivery and to their
newborn babies greatly reduces MTCT.
Why Was This Study Done? Because of ongoing
international efforts to increase ART coverage, more HIV￾positive women in Africa have access to ART now than ever
before. However, little is known about pregnancy outcomes
among HIV-infected African women taking ART throughout
pregnancy for their own health or about the long-term
outcomes of their offspring. In particular, few studies have
examined the effect of taking tenofovir (an antiretroviral
drug that is now recommended as part of first-line ART)
throughout pregnancy. Tenofovir readily crosses from
mother to child during pregnancy and, in animal experi￾ments, high doses of tenofovir given during pregnancy
caused bone demineralization (which weakens bones),
kidney problems, and impaired growth among offspring. In
this study, the researchers analyze data collected on
pregnancy and infant outcomes among Ugandan and
Zimbabwean HIV-positive women who took ART throughout
pregnancy in the Development of AntiRetroviral Therapy in
Africa (DART) trial. This trial was designed to test whether
ART could be safely and effectively delivered in Africa
without access to the expensive laboratory tests that are
routinely used to monitor ART toxicity and efficacy in
developed countries.
What Did the Researchers Do and Find? The pregnancy
outcomes of 302 women who became pregnant during the
DART trial and information on birth defects among their
babies were collected as part of the DART protocol;
information on the survival, growth, and development of
the infants born to these women was collected in a separate
infant study. Most of the women who became pregnant
were taking tenofovir-containing ART before and throughout
their pregnancies. 58% of the pregnancies resulted in a live
birth, 7% resulted in a stillbirth (birth of a dead baby at any
time from 22 weeks gestation to the end of pregnancy), and
35% resulted in a termination or miscarriage (before 22
weeks gestation). Of the 226 live births, seven infants died
within 2 weeks and seven had birth defects. Similar
proportions of the infants exposed and not exposed to
tenofovir during pregnancy died soon after birth or had birth
defects. Of the 182 surviving infants who were enrolled in
the infant study, 14 subsequently died at an average age of 9
months, giving a 1-year mortality of 5%. None of the
surviving children who were tested (172 infants) were HIV
infected. No bone fractures or major kidney problems
occurred during follow-up and prebirth exposure to
tenofovir in utero had no effect on growth or weight gain
at 2 years (in contrast to a previous US study).
What Do These Findings Mean? By showing that
prebirth tenofovir exposure does not affect pregnancy
outcomes or increase birth defects, growth abnormalities,
or kidney problems, these findings support the use of
tenofovir-containing ART during pregnancy among HIV￾positive African women, and suggest that it could also be
used to prevent women of child-bearing age acquiring HIV￾infection heterosexually. Notably, the observed 5% 1-year
infant mortality is similar to the 2%–4% infant mortality
normally seen in the region. The absence of HIV infection
among the infants born to the DART participants is also
encouraging. However, this is a small study (only 111 infants
were exposed to tenofovir throughout pregnancy) and
women were not randomly assigned to receive tenofovir￾containing ART. Consequently, more studies are needed to
confirm that tenofovir exposure during pregnancy does not
affect pregnancy outcomes or have any long-term effects on
infants. Such studies are essential because the use of
tenofovir as a treatment for women who are HIV-positive is
likely to increase and tenofovir may also be used in the
future to prevent HIV acquisition in HIV-uninfected women.
