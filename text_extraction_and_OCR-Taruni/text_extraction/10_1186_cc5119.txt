Abstract
Introduction Cytokines are believed to play an important role in
acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF). Extracorporeal liver
support systems may exert beneficial effects in ACLF via
removal of cytokines. At present, two systems are commercially
available, the Molecular Adsorbent Recirculating System
(MARS™) and Fractionated Plasma Separation, Adsorption and
Dialysis (Prometheus™). The aim of this study was to compare
the effects of MARS and Prometheus treatments on serum
cytokine levels and their clearances.
Methods Eight patients with ACLF underwent alternating
treatments with either MARS or Prometheus in a randomized
cross-over design. Thirty-four treatments (17 MARS, 17
Prometheus) were available for analysis. Serum cytokines were
measured before and after each treatment, and cytokine
clearance was calculated from paired arterial and venous
samples and effective plasma flow one hour after the start of
treatment.
Results Baseline serum levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-10,
tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and soluble TNF-α
receptor 1 were significantly elevated in patients with ACLF.
Measurable plasma clearances were detected for all cytokines
tested, but no significant changes in serum levels of any
cytokine were found after treatments with MARS or
Prometheus. In MARS treatments, IL-10 was cleared from
plasma more efficiently than IL-6. Clearance of IL-10 was higher
in Prometheus than in MARS treatments.
Conclusion Cytokines are cleared from plasma by both MARS
and Prometheus, but neither system is able to change serum
cytokine levels. This discrepancy is probably due to a high rate
of cytokine production in patients with ACLF.
Introduction
Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) has been defined as
acute deterioration of liver function in cirrhotic patients over a
period of two to four weeks, usually precipitated by gastroin￾testinal bleeding, infection, binge drinking, or surgery, and is
associated with progressive jaundice, hepatic encephalopathy
and/or hepatorenal syndrome, and signs of multi-organ dys￾function [1]. ACLF has been shown to carry poor prognosis,
with an in-hospital mortality ranging from 50% to 66% [2,3].
Several extracorporeal liver support systems have been devel￾oped to improve prognosis in acute liver failure as well as
ACLF, and in a recent meta-analysis, artificial liver support was
shown to reduce mortality in ACLF as compared with standard
medical treatment [4]. Recently, research has focused on cell￾free systems, such as the Molecular Adsorbent Recirculating
System (MARS™; Gambro AB, Stockholm, Sweden) and the
Fractionated Plasma Separation, Adsorption and Dialysis sys￾tem (Prometheus™; Fresenius Medical Care AG & Co. KGaA,
Homburg, Germany), which provide elimination of albumin￾ACLF = acute-on-chronic liver failure; APACHE II = acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II; ELISA = enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay;

bound toxins and thus are believed to enhance liver regenera￾tion [5,6].
The designs of MARS and Prometheus differ considerably. In
MARS, blood is dialyzed across an albumin-impermeable
membrane with a molecular weight cutoff of 60 kDa against
20% human serum albumin, which is continuously cleansed by
subsequent passage through columns of charcoal and an
anion exchange resin. Water-soluble substances such as
NH4
+ are removed by a low-flux dialyzer connected to the sec￾ondary circuit [6,7]. In Prometheus, the patient's plasma, con￾taining the albumin, is separated by a membrane with a
molecular weight cutoff of approximately 250 kDa and directly
passed over two columns containing different adsorbents.
Water-soluble substances are cleared by a high-flux dialyzer
directly inserted into the blood circuit [5,8-10].
Whereas elimination of albumin-bound substances such as
bilirubin or bile acids has been well defined for both MARS
and Prometheus [8,11-16], little is known of their impact on
pathophysiology of liver failure. Beneficial effects of extracor￾poreal liver support might be evoked by modifying the patient's
response to the disease. Systemic inflammatory reaction,
characterized by a predominantly proinflammatory cytokine
profile, may cause the transition from stable cirrhosis to ACLF
[17]. Proinflammatory cytokines are believed to mediate
hepatic inflammation, apoptosis and necrosis of liver cells,
cholestasis, and fibrosis [18]. Therefore, it has been hypothe￾sized that removal of proinflammatory cytokines could be ben￾eficial in patients with ACLF [19]. However, data on the effect
of extracorporeal liver assist devices on serum cytokine levels
are controversial [19-26]. This might be attributed to the inho￾mogeneous patient groups studied and to the diversity of tests
used by different groups.
In previous studies performed in the same group of patients,
we compared the elimination capacity of both systems for
bilirubin fractions and bile acids and found superior removal of
bilirubin (especially of the unconjugated fraction) by Prometh￾eus but similar removal of bile acids by both systems [12,15].
The aim of the present study was to evaluate and compare the
removal of several cytokines associated with inflammatory liver
disease by MARS and Prometheus in patients with ACLF.
Materials and methods
Patients
Seven consecutive patients with ACLF as defined above and
one patient with primary dysfunction of a liver graft after trans￾plantation for decompensated liver cirrhosis were enrolled. In
four of the eight patients, alcoholic hepatitis was the precipi￾tating event causing acute decompensation of preexisting
alcoholic liver cirrhosis (Table 1). To assess severity of liver
disease, Child-Pugh score and model for end-stage liver dis￾ease (MELD) score were calculated at baseline [27,28]. The

acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II)
and sepsis-related organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores
were used to estimate multi-organ dysfunction [29,30].
Besides, the presence or absence of a systemic inflammatory
response syndrome (SIRS) was documented [31].
Patients were allocated to MARS or Prometheus treatments in
a randomized cross-over design. By means of sealed enve￾lopes, patients were randomly assigned to start with either
MARS or Prometheus and underwent alternating MARS and
Prometheus treatments on two to eight consecutive days. The
number of treatments applied was dependent on the clinical
course. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Com￾mittee of the Medical University of Graz, and informed consent
was obtained in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
Extracorporeal liver support
MARS and Prometheus treatments were performed for six
hours at identical blood and dialyzate flows in all patients (200
and 300 ml/minute, respectively), and the same dialysis
machine (4008 H; Fresenius Medical Care AG & Co. KGaA)
was used during the entire study. The flows in the secondary
circuit were set to 200 ml/minute in MARS and 300 ml/minute
in Prometheus as recommended by the manufacturers. The
dialyzate contained glucose (1 g/l) and magnesium (0.75
mmol/l), and sodium, potassium, and bicarbonate were
adjusted to fit each patient's needs. Heparin, epoprostenol
(Flolan®; GlaxoSmithKline, Vienna, Austria) (4 ng/kg per
minute), or both were used for anticoagulation, and activated
partial thromboplastin time was aimed to remain less than 100
seconds. All patients were treated via a central venous cathe￾ter. Infusions of albumin or packed red cells were not allowed
during treatments.
Liver biopsy
In four of the eight patients, a transjugular liver biopsy was per￾formed prior to extracorporeal liver support. Liver biopsy spec￾imens were routinely stained with hematoxylin and eosin and
chromotrope aniline blue and were assessed for the presence
of steatohepatitis by one of us (CL).
Cytokine assays
Blood samples were drawn at baseline, at the end of, and one
hour after the end of each treatment. In addition, paired sam￾ples were obtained from the afferent and efferent branches of
the central venous line at one hour. Serum samples from 28
voluntary blood donors were used as controls. Samples were
centrifuged after 30 minutes, and serum aliquots were stored
frozen at -70°C for later assay of cytokines. Interleukin (IL)-6
was analyzed by a chemiluminescent assay (Immulite 2000;
DPC Biermann GmbH, Bad Nauheim, Germany). Enzyme￾linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to measure the
levels of IL-8, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)
(Quantikine®; R&D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA), and
soluble TNF-α receptor 1 (sTNF-αR1) (BMS203CE; Bender
MedSystems GmbH, Vienna, Austria). The methods were
applied according to the manufacturers' recommendations. In
brief, for IL-6, a solid-phase, enzyme-labeled, chemilumines￾cent sequential immunometric assay was performed. A 100-μl
serum sample was added to the test tube containing an assay￾specific coated bead and incubated at 37°C for 30 minutes.
Unbound material was washed from the bead, and chemilumi￾nescent substrate was added. Light emission was read with a
high-sensitivity photon counter. For cytokine ELISA (IL-8, IL￾10, TNF-α, and sTNF-αR1), analyte-specific antibodies (cap￾ture antibodies) were pre-coated onto a microplate. A 100-μl
serum sample was added, and any analyte present was bound
by the immobilized antibody. An enzyme-linked analyte-spe￾cific detection antibody then was bound to a second epitope
on the analyte, forming the analyte-antibody complex. Sub￾strate was added and optical density was read on a microplate
reader.
Calculations
Because cytokines are cleared from the plasma fraction of
whole blood, plasma clearance (PlCl) rather than blood clear￾ance was chosen. PlCl was calculated at one hour of treat￾ment from paired afferent (a) and efferent (e) samples and from
plasma flow. In treatments in which excess body water has to
be removed by ultrafiltration, the concentration in the venous
sample may be increased due to the effects of hemoconcen￾tration on albumin and albumin-bound solutes. Failure to
account for this will lead to an underestimation of PlCl. PlCl
corrected for the effect of hemoconcentration was determined
as follows: PlCl = [(1 - e/a) × Qp] + [UF × (e/a)], where Qp is
plasma flow (Qp = blood flow × [1 - hematocrit], in milliliters
per minute) and UF is ultrafiltration rate (in milliliters per
minute).
Statistics
Results are expressed as median (Q1; Q3) unless indicated
otherwise. To analyze the relationship between variables, lin￾ear regression analysis was performed. Groups were com￾pared by the Mann-Whitney test and, in the case of paired
samples, by the Wilcoxon test. When more than two groups
were compared, one-way analysis of variance with Dunnett T3
post hoc analysis was used. A p value less than 0.05 was con￾sidered statistically significant.
Results
Between March 2003 and April 2004, eight patients were
enrolled and 34 treatments (17 MARS and 17 Prometheus)
were available for analysis. Patient characteristics at baseline
and clinical outcome are presented in Table 1. Treatments
were well tolerated, and no major procedure-related adverse
events occurred. Therapy had to be intermittently interrupted
up to 30 minutes twice during MARS (leakage, clotting) and
three times during Prometheus (clotting) but was continued
afterward.

Serum levels of all cytokines were below the upper limit of nor￾mal in 28 voluntary blood donors (21 male, 7 female; age 53
± 3 years) who served as controls. Liver histology revealed cir￾rhosis in all four patients who had a liver biopsy and superim￾posed steatohepatitis in two patients who had a history of
recent heavy alcohol abuse.
At baseline, serum levels of IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-α, and sTNF￾αR1 were elevated in patients with ACLF as compared with
controls (Figures 1 and 2). No differences in baseline levels
between patients undergoing MARS or Prometheus as first
treatment were noted. Likewise, no difference in baseline lev￾els between survivors and non-survivors at day 30 after admis￾sion was found.
A measurable PlCl was found for all cytokines studied (Table
2). In MARS treatments, PlCl of IL-10 was significantly higher
than that of IL-6. In Prometheus treatments, no differences in
cytokine clearance were observed. Prometheus cleared IL-10
from plasma more efficiently than MARS.
No significant changes in IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-α, and sTNF￾αR1 serum levels could be found in the course of six hour
treatments with MARS or Prometheus, and no significant
rebound 60 minutes after the treatment was noted for any of
the tested cytokines (Figure 1). Cytokine levels were not differ￾ent between survivors and non-survivors (day 30) at any time
point, and no differences were found between the beginning
and the end of the treatment series (Figure 2).
In four of the eight patients studied, alcoholic hepatitis was the
precipitating event. When baseline cytokine levels of these
four patients were compared with those of the non-alcoholic
patients, no significant differences were found (data not

shown). Likewise, baseline cytokine levels were not different
between patients with (n = 4) or without (n = 4) renal failure
as defined by a baseline serum creatinine level above normal
(data not shown).
Baseline IL-6 values and IL-8 values tended to be higher in
patients with SIRS, whereas no difference in IL-10, TNF-α, and
sTNF-αR1 levels was found in patients with or without SIRS.
When linear regression analysis was performed, both IL-10 (R
= -0.73, p < 0.05; Y = 13 - [0.1 × X]) and sTNF-αR1 (R =
0.84, p < 0.05; Y = -136 + [13.2 × X]) were significantly
related to Child-Pugh score. In contrast, none of the cytokines
tested correlated with MELD, SOFA, or APACHE II score.
Discussion
In the present study in patients with ACLF, we observed ele￾vated serum levels of five cytokines commonly associated with
inflammatory liver disease (IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-α, and sTNF￾αR1) at baseline. Both MARS and Prometheus treatments
showed measurable clearances for all cytokines studied. How￾ever, neither MARS nor Prometheus could lower serum levels
of any cytokine.
Elevated serum levels of several cytokines, including TNF-α,
sTNF-αR1, sTNF-αR2, IL-2, IL-2R, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and
interferon-γ, have been described in patients with ACLF
[19,22], whereas other studies reported normal TNF-α levels
in patients with ACLF or acute liver failure [20,22,24]. Ele￾vated levels of circulating cytokines in ACLF may be the result
of increased production due to endotoxemia, cytokine release

by necrotic liver cells, and/or reduced hepatic removal. TNF-α
can induce apoptosis of hepatocytes, especially in alcoholic
liver disease when hepatocytes are sensitized to TNF-α￾induced apoptosis [32]. Therefore, removal of proinflammatory
cytokines such as TNF-α from plasma might be considered
beneficial. However, cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-6 may
also promote liver regeneration by inducing acute-phase pro￾teins and hepatic proliferation and by exhibiting anti-apoptotic
effects [18,32]. Because cytokines represent not only endo￾crine but also autocrine and paracrine effector molecules, it
should be pointed out that elevated systemic levels are not
representative of their role in the pathophysiology of liver
failure.
Extracorporeal liver support systems use membranes with a
higher molecular weight cutoff than conventional hemofilters
and should therefore facilitate the elimination of larger mole￾cules such as cytokines. Specifically, the molecular weight
cutoff of the MARS membrane (60 kDa) is higher than the
molecular weight of most cytokines (Table 2). However, previ￾ous studies on the removal of cytokines by MARS have
produced conflicting results (Table 3). In patients with ACLF,
MARS was shown to remove IL-8 over the activated charcoal
column and sTNF-αR1 over the dialysis membrane, but no
effect on serum levels of any cytokine tested was found [19].
This finding is consistent with a study in children with acute
Wilson's disease reporting the transfer of TNF-α and IL-6 into
the albumin circuit [21]. In contrast, four other studies that
included patients with ACLF or acute liver failure reported a
significant decrease of several cytokines in the course of
MARS treatments [20,22,23,33]. Finally, in a Chinese study in
patients with multi-organ dysfunction syndrome, MARS was
able to lower TNF-α, IL-2, IL-6, and IL-8 [25]. Because Pro￾metheus has a molecular weight cutoff of 250 kDa, cytokines
should be readily transferred to the secondary circuit. At
present, only one study on cytokine removal by Prometheus is
available showing that TNF-α and IL-6 levels were not
changed significantly during treatment [9].
Continuous renal replacement therapy per se may remove
cytokines from plasma by convection and membrane adsorp￾tion (reviewed in [34]). However, removal of cytokines is not
sufficient to result in a significant and sustained effect on
plasma concentrations. This low efficiency has been attributed
to rapid saturation of easily accessible binding sites on the
membrane as well as inefficient use of less accessible binding
sites due to a low convective driving force. The authors sug￾gest that optimal mediator removal might be obtained by a
combination of a high transmembrane pressure and frequent
membrane changes, but this would not be feasible in clinical
practice [34]. Thus, alternative devices with specific cytokine
adsorbers are needed but are still at the developmental stage.
A recent study from Belgium demonstrated an improvement in

mean arterial pressure and systemic vascular resistance in
MARS but not Prometheus treatments, which has been
attributed to a higher capacity for removal of endogenous
vasoactive substances by MARS [35]. However, it cannot be
ruled out that in Prometheus such vasodilators are cleared to
a similar extent but possible beneficial hemodynamic effects
are counterbalanced by a blood pressure drop due to the
larger extracorporeal volume. Increased production of proin￾flammatory cytokines such as TNF-α has been suggested to
represent an important mechanism for the circulatory changes
observed in ACLF. Thus, removal of TNF-α by extracorporeal
liver support could have beneficial hemodynamic effects.
However, in the present study, we could not demonstrate any
changes in serum cytokine levels during treatment sessions
nor any differences between the two devices. These data are
consistent with the findings by Sen and colleagues [19] for
MARS and by Rifai and colleagues [9] for Prometheus.
It should be noted that comparison of data between different
studies is hampered by the lack of standardization for cytokine
assays. Cytokines and their soluble receptors may be
measured by bioassays or immunoassays such as ELISA. The
performance of ELISA methods is largely dependent on the
quality of the capture antibodies used. Further potential
sources of error include detection of degraded cytokines that
are immunoreactive but not biologically active, matrix effects,
presence of cytokine inhibitors, and inadequate sample stor￾age [36].
Several prognostic scoring systems have been developed for
patients with chronic liver disease as well as for patients
admitted to an intensive care unit. In addition, serum levels of
proinflammatory cytokines have been linked to the develop￾ment of multi-organ failure and IL-8 was found to correlate with
APACHE II score and mortality rate [37,38]. A study on 251
non-selected critically ill patients revealed APACHE III score
to be the best predictor and detectable TNF-α a weak inde￾pendent predictor of death [39]. We could not demonstrate
correlations between serum levels of any cytokine and
APACHE II or SOFA score, but interestingly, both IL-10 and
sTNF-αR1 correlated with Child-Pugh score, an index of liver
dysfunction.
Conclusion
The present study demonstrates marked elevations of serum
cytokine levels in patients with ACLF. Both MARS and Pro￾metheus were able to clear cytokines from plasma, but they
did not change serum cytokine levels significantly. This appar￾ent discrepancy is probably due to a high rate of ongoing
cytokine production in ACLF counterbalancing elimination
within the extracorporeal circuits. These findings should
temper a liberal use of current extracorporeal liver support sys￾tems in intensive care medicine and promote further research
in the development of cytokine-specific adsorbents.

Key messages
• In ACLF, serum levels of IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-α, and 
sTNF-αR1 are elevated. These cytokines may be 
involved in the pathogenesis of ACLF.
• MARS and Prometheus are cell-free extracorporeal liver 
support systems providing elimination of albumin-bound 
as well as water-soluble toxins that accumulate in liver 
failure.
• Both MARS and Prometheus show measurable clear￾ance for IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-α, and sTNF-αR1.
• However, neither MARS nor Prometheus treatment is 
able to reduce serum levels of these cytokines, presum￾ably due to high production rates.
• Alternative concepts are needed for effective removal of 
cytokines (for example, systems using cytokine-specific 
adsorbents).
