Abstract
Introduction: Although autologous bone marrow cell (BMC) therapy has emerged as a promising treatment for
acute myocardial infarction (AMI), trials reported mixed results. In the BONAMI trial, active smoking reduced cardiac
function recovery after reperfused AMI. Therefore, we hypothesized that variability in the functionality of BMCs retrieved
from patients with cardiovascular risk factors may partly explain these mixed results. We investigated the characteristics of
progenitor cells in active smokers and non-smokers with AMI and their potential impact on BMC therapy efficacy.
Methods: Bone marrow and blood samples from 54 smoking and 47 non-smoking patients enrolled in the BONAMI
cell therapy trial were analyzed.
Results: The white BMC and CD45dimCD34+ cell numbers were higher in active smokers (P = 0.001, P = 0.03,
respectively). In marked contrast, either bone marrow or blood endothelial progenitor CD45dimCD34 + KDR + cells
(EPCs) were decreased in active smokers (P = 0.005, P = 0.04, respectively). Importantly, a multivariate analysis including
cardiovascular risk factors confirmed the association between active smoking and lower EPC number in bone marrow
(P = 0.04) and blood (P = 0.04). Furthermore, baseline circulating EPC count predicted infarct size decrease at three
months post-AMI in non-smokers (P = 0.01) but not in active smokers. Interestingly, baseline circulating EPCs were no
longer predictive of cardiac function improvement in the BMC therapy group.
Conclusions: These data suggest that circulating EPCs play an important role in cardiac repair post-AMI only in
non-smokers and that active smoking-associated EPC alterations may participate in the impairment of cardiac
function recovery observed in smokers after AMI, an effect that was overridden by BMC therapy.
Introduction
It has now been more than a decade since clinical scientists
began to explore a potential beneficial effect of adminis￾tering cells to the ischemically injured heart. Stimulated
by pioneering experimental studies that showed that bone
marrow–derived cells (BMCs) might regenerate infarcted
myocardium clinicians quickly translated this concept into
clinical applications [1]. Although all clinical trials have
reported the remarkable safety of intracoronary adminis￾tration of autologous BMCs in patients with acute myocar￾dial infarction (AMI), the overall effect on improvement in
left ventricle ejection fraction has been modest and signifi￾cantly less persuasive than the expectations raised by the
results obtained in preclinical animal models, reflecting our
incomplete understanding of underlying mechanisms [2].
One hypothesis for such discrepancies is wide inter-patient
variability in cell functionality. This issue is particularly
relevant to the use of autologous bone marrow cells, the

function of which is decreased by advanced age [3], and
the risk factors for atherosclerosis [4-6] which implies that
these patients are at risk of being treated with cells that
are intrinsically defective. The prognostic impact of this
altered pattern is reflected by the predictive value of the
colony forming unit (CFU) capacity of the infused cells on
the treatment outcome in chronic ischemic heart disease
[7]. Furthermore, in a recent study using transgenic mouse
models Wang et al. demonstrated that donor myocardial
infarction by itself impairs the therapeutic potential of bone
marrow cells [8], suggesting that another reason clinical
autologous BMC trials have shown conflicting results may
be that the BMCs used in the human AMI trials are
impaired by the effect of acute cardiac injury on BMCs.
In the BONAMI trial [9], we randomized patients with
successfully reperfused AMI, residual left ventricular ejec￾tion fraction (LVEF) of ≤45% and myocardial viability
defects, to intracoronary BMC infusion or state-of-the-art
therapy. The primary endpoint of the study was improve￾ment of myocardial viability three months after AMI. We
observed a trend in favor of the cell transfer group, with
myocardial viability improving in 16/47 patients in the
BMC group compared with 7/43 in the control group
(P = 0.06). Interestingly, a multivariate logistic regression
analysis including other major prognostic factors for left
ventricular function recovery after AMI also showed that
BMCs improve myocardial viability recovery and that
active smoking impairs myocardial viability recovery. Thus,
we hypothesized that smoking may adversely affect the
favorable cell-mediated response.
Therefore, the aim of the current study was to investigate
the characteristics of BMCs in smoking and non-smoking
patients after AMI in the BONAMI trial and their impact
on the efficacy of BMC therapy.
Methods
Study design
The study population included 101 patients with AMI
recruited from the patient cohort undergoing intracoronary
cell infusion (BMC group) or not (control group) from the
BONAMI trial (NCT00200707). The ethics review board of
the Nantes University Hospital approved both protocols,
and studies were conducted in accordance with the Dec￾laration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained
from each patient.
Patients admitted with an ST-segment elevation AMI
at the University Hospitals of Créteil, Grenoble, Lille,
Montpellier, Nantes and Toulouse were enrolled in the
BONAMI trial between December 2004 and January
2007 [9]. Enrollment criteria were an age between 18 and
75 years, a successful percutaneous coronary intervention
with stent implantation performed on the culprit lesion
during the 24 hours after the onset of symptoms, LVEF
lower than 45%, absence of myocardial viability in at
least 2 contiguous segments out of 17 by 4-hour resting
thallium-201-gated-single-photon-emission computed tom￾ography (SPECT), and statin treatment. In addition, base￾line echocardiography was performed on days 4 to 7.
Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either the
control group (n = 49) or the BMC group receiving cardiac
cell therapy (n = 52). A peripheral blood sample was
obtained from patients in both groups seven to ten days
after AMI. Moreover, a 50 mL bone marrow sample was
aspirated the same day from the iliac crest for 51 of the
patients in the cardiac cell therapy group. Of this sample,
1 mL was used for biological study and the remainder was
used for preparation of the cell therapy product (100 × 106
bone-marrow mononucleated cells). A total of 93/101
peripheral blood samples and 47/51 bone marrow sam￾ples were evaluated. All biological samples were trans￾ferred at room temperature within 24 hours to Nantes,
France, where all biological analyses were performed.
Smoking status was evaluated at the time of admis￾sion to the hospital (day 0 of AMI). Patients were clas￾sified as active smokers, non-smokers (patients who
had never smoked) or former smokers (patients who
had stopped smoking at least three months before day 0
of AMI).
Clinical follow-up of patients enrolled in the BONAMI trial
Echocardiography and SPECT were repeated three months
after AMI. Two independent core-imaging laboratories
blinded to treatment assignment performed all analyses
at baseline and at three months. Procedures have been
described in detail previously [9].
Three parameters were selected for the present study.
First, change in LVEF was measured by echocardiography
between baseline and the three-month follow-up. Second,
two myocardial viability parameters measured by four-hour
resting SPECT were studied: change in infarct size between
baseline and the three-month follow-up, and third, myo￾cardial viability improvement which was defined as the
number of non-viable segments at baseline that were
viable at the three-month follow-up.
Flow cytometry analysis
Flow cytometric analysis was performed using the BD
FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, France
SAS, Le Pont de Claix, France). Samples of peripheral blood
collected in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and
bone marrow collected in acid-citrate-dextrose (ACD)-
containing tubes were analyzed using flow cytometry. Cells
were incubated for 20 minutes at room temperature with
antibodies against human CD45 (PC7-labeled, Beckman
coulter), CD34 (APC-labeled, Beckman coulter, France
SAS, Villepinte, France), CD133 (phycoerythrin (PE)-
labeled, Miltenyi Biotec, SAS, Paris, France), KDR (PE￾labeled, R&D Systems, Abingdon, United Kingdom) and

CXCR4 (PE-labeled, Becton Dickinson). Red cells were sub￾sequently lysed with a lysing solution without washing (Facs
Lysing Solution™, Becton Dickinson). The inclusion of a cal￾ibrated number of Cytocount fluorescent beads (Cytocount
beads, Dako, Cytomation SA France, Trappes, France)
allowed the absolute positive cell numbers to be enumer￾ated directly from a single flow cytometric measurement.
Analysis was performed with the CellQuest Soft￾ware (BD Biosciences, San Jose, USA). Quantification of
CD45dimCD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs)
was performed according to the gating strategy described
in the International Society of Hematotherapy and Graft
Engineering (ISHAGE) guidelines [See Additional file 1:
Figure S1] [10]. Expression of CD133, KDR and CXCR4
markers was studied in CD45dimCD34+ cells. This allows
us to distinguish EPC from mature endothelial cells, a cell
subpopulation that is CD45- [11]. All analyses were per￾formed by two independent investigators who were blinded
to patient groups.
Preparation of mononuclear cells
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were iso￾lated using lymphocyte preparation medium centrifugation
procedures (Eurobio). Bone marrow mononuclear cells
(BMMCs) were directly obtained from cell therapy product
surplus in patients enrolled in the BONAMI trial.
Colony-forming unit assay for HPCs
PBMCs or BMMCs were seeded in triplicate in methyl￾cellulose-coated plates (Methocult GF H4534; Stem Cell
Technologies, Grenoble, France). Plates were studied under
phase-contrast microscopy, and granulocyte macrophage
colony-forming units (CFU-GM; colonies >40 cells) were
counted after 14 days of culture by two independent inves￾tigators blinded to patient group.
Colony-forming unit assay for EPCs
PBMCs or BMMCs were seeded in fibronectin-coated
plates (Endocult, Stem Cell Technologies) and cultured at
37°C in 5% CO2. After two days of culture, non-adherent
cells were harvested and replated in fibronectin-coated
plates. After three days of culture, endothelial cell colony￾forming units (CFU-EC) were counted using phase-contrast
microscopy by two independent investigators blinded to
patient group. Colonies were defined as recommended by
the manufacturer as the presence of a central core of
round cells surrounded by radiating thin flat cells.
Migration assay
Granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), stromal
cell-derived factor (SDF)-1α or vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF, 100 ng/mL) were added to the culture
medium in the lower chambers of 8-micron transwells
(Becton Dickinson), and 1 × 105 PBMCs or BMMCs were
placed in the upper chambers. After three hours of
culture, cells were counted in the lower chamber and
the ratio between the number of cells that migrated in
the presence or in the absence of G-CSF, SDF-1α or
VEGF was calculated. Each experiment was performed
in duplicate.
VEGF quantification
Plasma samples from peripheral blood collected in EDTA￾containing tubes were aliquoted and stored at −80°C until
use. Plasma VEGF level was measured with an ELISA kit
following the manufacturer’s instructions (human VEGF
kit; R&D Systems).
Statistical analysis
All biological results were expressed as mean value with
standard deviation. The baseline characteristics and bio￾logical data were recorded for each group and compared
using t-test or Mann Whitney for continuous variables,
and Chi2 test or Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables.
Correlations were evaluated by Spearman’s rho or Pearson’s
r tests.
A multivariate analysis was performed to identify factors
associated with cell numbers (either absolute or relative)
using linear regression analysis with a manual selection
of factors. Evaluated factors were the following clinical
variables: age, sex, major cardiovascular risk factors (hyper￾tension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, active smoking).
Another multivariate analysis was performed to test
if smoking status, EPC numbers and their potential inter￾action altered cardiac function improvement at three
months post-AMI using linear regression analysis with a
manual selection of factors. The same multivariate analysis
was performed with CD34 + CD45dimCXCR4 or with
CFU-EC. Evaluated cardiac function parameters were
changes in LVEF, myocardial viability and infarct size mea￾sured by SPECT from baseline to three months post-AMI.
P-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. All
analyses were performed using SAS 9.2 statistical software.
Results
Impact of active smoking on patients with AMI
Baseline characteristics of the patients enrolled in the
BONAMI trial grouped according to smoking status are
presented in Table 1. Among the 101 randomized patients,
54% were active smokers at the time of AMI. In the former
smokers group, time since smoking cessation was 22 ± 13
years, with only one patient having stopped smoking for
less than 2 years. As compared to non/former smokers,
active smokers were younger with a lower frequency of
hypertension, hyperlipidemia and diabetes.
Differences in progenitor cell numbers were analyzed
in peripheral blood and bone marrow samples collected

9.3 ± 1.7 days after percutaneous coronary intervention
for acute myocardial infarction.
The most important differences in cell subpopulations
between active and non/former smokers were observed in
the bone marrow (Table 2). First, the white cell (WC) ab￾solute number per microliter was higher in active smokers
as compared to non/former smokers (P = 0.001). Although
the absolute number of hematopoietic progenitor cells
(HPCs), including CD45dimCD34+, CD45dimCD34 +
CD133+ and CD45dimCD34 + CXCR4+ cells, was in￾creased in active smokers (P = 0.02, P = 0.005 and P = 0.01,
respectively), the relative HPC number (expressed as a
percentage per 105 WC) was not different between active
and non/former smokers. In marked contrast, endothelial
progenitor CD45dimCD34 + KDR + cell (EPC) relative
number expressed as a percentage per 105 WC was signifi￾cantly lower in active smokers as compared to non/former
smokers (P = 0.04). Furthermore, BMCs from active smokers
showed a significantly lower migratory response to G-CSF
(P = 0.03) as compared to BMCs from non/former smoker
patients. Finally, measurements of either CFU-GM or
CFU-EC were not statistically different between patients
with or without active smoking.
In peripheral blood, while white blood cell (WBC) count
was higher in patients with active smoking (P = 0.02,
Table 2), there were no significant differences in peripheral
blood HPCs according to smoking status. In marked
contrast, either absolute or relative number of circulating
EPCs were lower in active smokers (P = 0.02 and P = 0.005,
respectively). No correlation was observed between EPC
numbers and inflammatory response post-MI, assessed by
blood C-reactive protein (CRP) and WBC measurements.
Differences in HPC and EPC number were also ana￾lyzed in the presence or absence of major cardiovascular
risk factors (age, active smoking, diabetes, hyperlipidemia,
hypertension) in peripheral blood and bone marrow. Active
smoking was the only factor together with age associated
with differences in progenitor cell numbers, in univariate
analysis both in bone marrow and in peripheral blood
(not shown). Importantly, a multivariate linear regression
analysis including cardiovascular risk factors (age, sex,
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, active smoking)
also identified an association between active smoking and
a lower relative number of EPCs, in either bone marrow
(P = 0.04) or blood (P = 0.04), demonstrating that the
relationship between active smoking and a reduced EPC
number was independent of the other cardiovascular risk
factors.
Together these data show a greater overall bone marrow
activation post-AMI in active smokers. In contrast, there
was no increase in EPC number in either bone marrow
or blood of active smokers as compared to non/former
smokers and no blood mobilization of EPCs, suggesting
that there was a lack of specific activation of the endothelial
cell lineage in active smokers.
Correlation between blood EPC number and
improvement of cardiac function after AMI
In order to identify potential relationships between blood
circulating progenitor cell levels and improvement of
cardiac function three months post-AMI, we performed
Spearman correlations between baseline blood EPC
numbers (absolute and relative) and (1) change in LVEF,
(2) change in infarct size and (3) myocardial viability
improvement. This analysis was performed separately in
patients randomized to BMC therapy (n = 52) and control
(n = 49) group, in order to account for a potential inde￾pendent effect of BMC infusion on cardiac function.
At baseline and three months post-AMI, mean LVEF did
not differ between BMC and control groups (38.1 ± 7.9%

41.5 ± 8.76% at three months post-AMI). Furthermore,
mean LVEF was not significantly modified between baseline
and three months post-AMI in either BMC or control
groups (P = 0.14 and P = 0.07, respectively).
As previously shown [12], change in LVEF at three
months post-AMI significantly correlated with the absolute
number of circulating EPCs at baseline in the control group
(P = 0.05, Figure 1A). Importantly, change in LVEF did not
correlate with EPC number in the BMC group (Figure 2A).
No such correlation was observed between the number
of circulating EPCs and change in infarct size or myocardial
viability improvement (data not shown). In addition, no
correlation was observed between the number of circulat￾ing EPCs, and LVEF, infarct size or myocardial viability at
baseline (data not shown). Also, there was no correlation
between EPC number and time to reperfusion after AMI,
another predictive factor for LVEF improvement after
AMI (data not shown).
No correlation was observed between CD34 + CD45dim￾CXCR4+ cells (absolute numbers and percentage of white
cells), in both bone marrow and blood according to tobacco
status and cell therapy efficacy, measured by change in
LVEF or in myocardial viability from baseline to three
months post-AMI (not shown). Similarly, no correlation
was observed between CFU-EC, in both bone marrow and
blood, according to tobacco status and cell therapy efficacy,
measured by change in LVEF or in myocardial viability
from baseline to three months post-AMI (not shown).
Correlation between blood EPC number and myocardial
viability after AMI according to smoking status
In order to evaluate the predictive value of smoking status
and EPC number on cardiac function improvement at
three months post-AMI, we performed a multivariate
analysis. In particular, in the BONAMI trial, cardiac
function analysis focused on myocardial viability, as this is
a reliable parameter for prediction of recovery of cardiac

was performed separately in patients randomized to cell
therapy (BMC) (n = 52) and the control group (n = 49), in
order to account for the potential effect of BMC infusion.
In the control group, there was an interaction between
smoking status and the baseline number of circulating
EPCs with respect to its relationship to myocardial via￾bility improvement (P = 0.02 and P = 0.004 for absolute
and relative number, respectively), which was the primary
end-point of the BONAMI trial, measured by the gain of
viable segments at three months post-AMI on SPECT.

smoking status and clinical parameters (change in LVEF: P = 0.39, in infarct size: P = 0.27, in gain of myocardial viability: P = 0.36), nor correlations
between cell number and clinical parameters after adjustment for smoking status (LVEF: P = 0.68, infarct size: P = 0.99, myocardial viability improvement:
P = 0.06). Myocardial viability improvement was expressed as the number of non-viable segments at baseline that were viable at three months
follow-up, measured by four-hour resting SPECT. AMI, acute myocardial infarction; LVEF, left ventricular ejection fraction; SPECT, thallium-201-gated￾single-photon-emission computed tomography.

show significant correlation between baseline circulating
EPCs and myocardial viability improvement (Figure 1B-C).
Furthermore, in the control group there was also an
interaction between smoking status and the baseline
number of circulating EPCs with respect to its relationship
to the change in infarct size measured by SPECT (P = 0.01
and P = 0.02 for absolute and relative number, respectively).
Subgroup analysis showed that in non/former smokers,
a higher absolute number of circulating EPCs was signifi￾cantly associated with a greater reduction in infarct size
measured by SPECT (P = 0.01, Figure 1D), whereas this
correlation was not found in active smokers (Figure 1E).
Interestingly, in patients from the BMC group, interac￾tions between smoking status and EPC numbers with re￾spect to its relationship to cardiac function improvement
(Figure 2B-C) were no longer observed.
Discussion
Our study shows that patients with active smoking, as
compared to non-smoking and former smoking patients,
had an increased number of bone marrow cells with an ab￾sence of endothelial cell lineage increase after reperfused
AMI. Furthermore, the number of circulating EPCs in non￾smokers and former smokers was predictive of infarct size
decrease measured by SPECT at three months post-AMI,
suggesting that circulating EPCs play a significant role after
AMI in these patients. In marked contrast, in patients
with active smoking, circulating EPCs were less numerous
and their migration was impaired. Finally, circulating EPC
number was not predictive of myocardial viability improve￾ment at three months post-AMI in this subgroup. These
data suggest that active smoking-associated EPC alterations
plausibly participate in the impairment of cardiac function
recovery observed in smokers after reperfused AMI. Im￾portantly, circulating EPCs were no longer predictive of
cardiac function improvement in patients who received
BMC therapy, irrespective of their smoking status. This
observation suggests that BMC therapy may override the
plausible consequences of EPC alterations observed in the
active smoking group.
Patient smoking status was suggested as a significant
modifier of viability recovery in the BONAMI trial [9].
Therefore, we aimed at studying the impact of patient
smoking status on blood and bone marrow content after
reperfused AMI. Because EPC are known to be involved
in tissue repair after ischemic events and also to be
modulated by smoking status, we focused mainly on the
role of EPCs on cardiac function recovery after reper￾fused AMI in both the control and BMC therapy groups.
Finally, as compared to our previous publication [9], this
new study provides a comparison of both blood and BM
cell components in smokers and non-smokers after reper￾fused AMI, identifies a potential relationship between EPC
blood content and cardiac function improvement after
AMI in smokers and non-smokers, and analyzes the impact
of cardiac cell therapy on this relationship.
Endothelial progenitor cells and cardiac repair in smokers
and non-smoker patients
The number and function of EPCs are regulated by a
variety of factors, including cardiovascular risk factors [14].
Among them, smoking critically reduces the number and
function of circulating EPCs in chronic coronary disease as
well as in active smokers without coronary disease [6]. In
our study, the number of either bone marrow or blood
CD45dimCD34 + KDR+/105 WC cells were decreased in
active smokers and their migratory response impaired, as
compared to non/former smoking patients. Circulating
EPCs isolated from patients with coronary artery disease
have previously been shown to have an impaired migratory
response, which is inversely correlated with the number
of cardiovascular risk factors [15]. A reduced number of
EPCs may be due to a variety of mechanisms, including
exhaustion of the pool of progenitor cells in the bone
marrow, impaired functional capacity within the bone
marrow, reduced mobilization of EPCs, or reduced survival
and/or differentiation of mobilized EPCs [6,14]. The pres￾ence of ‘good and poor mobilizers’ post-AMI is well-known
[16]. Our study is the first to perform a head-to-head
comparison of both bone marrow and blood EPCs num￾bers on active versus non/former smoking patients after
AMI, a time point clinically relevant for cardiac repair.
Data show reduced numbers of EPCs in blood as well as in
bone marrow in active smokers. This supports the hypoth￾esis of bone marrow exhaustion in smokers as compared
to non/former smokers. We previously showed in the
BONAMI trial that active smoking impaired cardiac
function recovery after AMI [9], findings that have also
been observed in animal models of tobacco-smoke or
nicotine exposure [17,18]. Therefore, we suggest that,
in patients not receiving cell therapy, active smoking￾related EPC alterations participate in the impairment
of cardiac function recovery after acute reperfused ST
elevation MI in smokers as compared to non/former
smokers. Alternatively, the absence of change in EPC
levels associated with myocardial infarction and smoking
status could be related to the presence of endothelial dys￾function in chronic smokers [19], as both may be related
[20]. Moreover, EPCs from heavy smokers die prematurely
during the early phase of culture [21]. Thus, it is likely that
active smoking acts on a variety of mechanisms that
synergistically culminate in reduced levels of circulating
EPCs [12]. We cannot exclude the possibility that the
lack of correlation between clinical parameters of cardiac
improvement and circulating EPC levels in active smokers
may also indicate that levels of circulating EPCs do not
reflect endogenous vascular repair capacity in the presence
of ongoing smoking–induced endothelial injury.

Endothelial progenitor cells and cardiac repair after AMI
A large body of evidence has been accumulated suggest￾ing the importance of (1) circulating EPCs, defined as
CD45dimCD34 + KDR + cells [11,22,23], in the mechanisms
of vascular repair and (2) EPC number as a marker of
vascular health and prognosis [14,22]. In this regard,
Werner et al. demonstrated in 519 patients with coronary
artery disease that increased numbers of CD34 + KDR+/105
WBC EPCs were associated with a reduced risk of death
from cardiovascular causes and of recurrence of revascular￾ization and hospitalization [24], a result recently confirmed
by meta-analysis [25]. By demonstrating a correlation
between baseline EPC levels and myocardial viability
improvement after AMI in non-smoking patients, our
study suggests that EPCs also play a significant role during
the specific situation of myocardial repair following AMI.
Impact of smoking status on the function of EPCs and on
cell therapy
BMCs comprise a heterogeneous mixture of cells con￾taining EPCs, HPCs, and other numerous cell types.
Our study confirms that AMI not only leads to quantitative
but also to qualitative changes in progenitor cells and that
mobilization of progenitor cells after AMI is selective for
specific cell types [26]. Several authors have recently
reported a negative impact of advanced age, risk factors
for atherosclerosis and red blood cell contamination
on BMC functionality, with important repercussions on
their in vivo capacity to promote blood flow recovery in a
nude mouse model of hind-limb ischemia [16]. Interest￾ingly, in the REPAIR-AMI trial, no association was detected
between BMC subpopulation numbers and contractile
recovery [27], as in our present study. This might be
due to the fact that all of the patients in the BMC
group received 108 BMCs, which was identified as the
minimum cell number necessary for beneficial effects
in a meta-analysis [28]. Thus, to detect a potential direct
cell number-related dose–response relationship, it might be
necessary to prospectively administer predefined numbers
of BMCs varying at least by a factor of 100-fold difference
[27]. In our study, the interaction observed between EPC
numbers and smoking status with respect to its relationship
to cardiac function improvement observed in the control
group was absent in the BMC group. This suggests that
the relatively high number of injected BMCs through the
coronary vasculature, including EPCs [9], may override the
potential role of circulating EPC level on cardiac function
improvement in the patients receiving BMC therapy,
reinforcing the concept of bone marrow exhaustion in the
active smoking group. These findings may also suggest
that EPCs may not be the most potent active component
for cardiac repair in BMCs. Indeed, BMCs is a highly het￾erogeneous cell therapy product comprising many distinct
cell types. Among those, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)
or c-kit+/lineage- cells also have a potential for cardiac re￾pair after MI. For example, bone-marrow-derived MSCs
have been shown to promote cardiac repair by multiple
mechanisms. If in vivo differentiation of MSCs into cardi￾omyocytes or vascular cells after cardiac delivery seems to
be very limited, MSCs secrete numerous soluble paracrine
factors that promote angiogenesis, stimulate resident
cardiac progenitor cells for cardiomyogenesis, or inhibit
fibrosis or apoptosis (reviewed in [29]). In addition, bone
marrow-derived C-kit+/lineage- cells have been shown to
activate endogenous cardiomyogenesis through stimulation
of endogenous cardiac progenitors [30] and angiogenesis
through secretion of soluble paracrine factors [31]. There￾fore, future studies are warranted to understand the critical
features of bone marrow-derived progenitor cell prepara￾tions and of patients with AMI that are predictive of a
favorable response to cell transfer [32].
Effect of AMI and/or smoking cessation on BMC numbers
Surprisingly we observed that active smokers had sig￾nificant increases in BM leukocyte and HPC numbers as
compared to non/former smokers. Importantly, both bone
marrow and blood samples were collected nine days after
the beginning of AMI, at a time when all patients were
staying in a cardiac care unit and had stopped smoking
since admission. In an interesting study, Kondo et al.
showed that circulating EPCs increased at day 7 after
smoking cessation and decreased again after resumption
of smoking to the level similar to that before cessation
[21]. This suggests that BM leukocyte and HPC numbers
observed in blood and bone marrow from AMI patients
with active smoking were linked to smoking cessation at
the time of examination and bone marrow/blood sampling
rather than active smoking.
Potential limitations
We decided to pool non-smokers and former smokers in
the same group of patients. Former smokers were defined
as patients who had stopped smoking for at least three
months at day 0 of AMI. Whereas the impact of past
tobacco smoke exposure in former smokers can modify
their overall risk of disease for years after smoking cessa￾tion, a large body of evidence shows that the risk of coron￾ary events drops rapidly after tobacco smoke exposure
cessation. For example, recent data analyzed the impact
of smoking ban laws in public places, showing that the
incidence of admission for coronary events is reduced
within months as compared to immediate pre-law inci￾dence [33-35]. In the population of former smokers in the
BONAMI trial, average time since smoking cessation was
22 ± 13 years. Furthermore, all but one patient had
stopped smoking for two or more years at the time of
admission for AMI.

Our study did not include viability and apoptosis markers
in the EPC flow quantification, both important variables
that can modulate efficacy of cardiac cell therapy [36]. As
of now there is no standardized protocol for multicenter
evaluation of apoptosis on EPCs. Therefore, apoptosis
quantification was not performed in the cell therapy
product for all patients as a part of its qualification and
validation. The number of BM CFU-EC did not correlate
with cell therapy efficacy (evaluated by change in LVEF or
myocardial viability), a result which is not in agreement
with previous studies demonstrating a correlation between
CFU-EC and neovascularization potential [37] or ulcer
healing [38]. Since in our study we only quantified CFU￾EC number, we cannot exclude a functional impairment
of these cells according to tobacco status or cell therapy
efficacy as it has previously been shown in coronary artery
disease [39] or in acute myocardial infarction [8].
Our study is observational and indeed no hypothesis was
experimentally tested. One option to gain further insight
into the impact of active smoking on EPCs and cardiac
repair after AMI would be to use animal models. How￾ever, current models for tobacco smoke exposure do not
replicate active smoking in humans. Animals are acutely
exposed to tobacco smoke for a few hours every day for
several weeks, whereas typical active smokers with AMI
have been smoking for years or decades. Cigarette con￾sumption is also more broadly distributed during the day
as compared to a typical three-hour exposure for animal
models. Therefore, findings from these animal studies
would potentially be misleading [40].
Conclusions
Our study emphasizes the potential role of EPCs in the
process of cardiac repair after AMI and shows that active
smoking impairs both bone marrow and EPC numbers
and functionality with plausible deleterious consequences
on cardiac function recovery after AMI. Interestingly,
BMC intracoronary infusion seems to override the con￾sequences of these alterations. Together, our data sug￾gest that these active smoking-related EPC alterations
may be a consequence, at least in part, of bone marrow
exhaustion.
