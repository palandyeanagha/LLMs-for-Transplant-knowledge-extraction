Abstract
Background: Patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc) may develop exercise intolerance due to musculoskeletal involvement,
restrictive lung disease, left ventricular dysfunction, or pulmonary vasculopathy (PV). The latter is particularly important
since it may lead to lethal pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). We hypothesized that abnormalities during
cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) in patients with SSc can identify PV leading to overt PAH.
Methods: Thirty SSc patients from the Harbor-UCLA Rheumatology clinic, not clinically suspected of having significant
pulmonary vascular disease, were referred for this prospective study. Resting pulmonary function and exercise gas
exchange were assessed, including peakVO2, anaerobic threshold (AT), heart rate- VO2 relationship (O2-pulse), exercise
breathing reserve and parameters of ventilation-perfusion mismatching, as evidenced by elevated ventilatory equivalent for
CO2 (VE/VCO2) and reduced end-tidal pCO2 (PETCO2) at the AT.
Results: Gas exchange patterns were abnormal in 16 pts with specific cardiopulmonary disease physiology: Eleven patients
had findings consistent with PV, while five had findings consistent with left-ventricular dysfunction (LVD). Although both
groups had low peak VO2 and AT, a higher VE/VCO2 at AT and decreasing PETCO2 during early exercise distinguished PV
from LVD.
Conclusions: Previously undiagnosed exercise impairments due to LVD or PV were common in our SSc patients.
Cardiopulmonary exercise testing may help to differentiate and detect these disorders early in patients with SSc.

Introduction
Dyspnea on exertion, fatigue, and reduced exercise tolerance
are common symptoms in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc).
These symptoms can often be explained by involvement of the
musculoskeletal system, lungs, heart, chest wall, and/or pulmo￾nary vasculature, in isolation or combination. Patients with SSc
are at particular risk for developing pulmonary vasculopathy (PV)
leading to pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Untreated,
PAH results in right ventricular failure, and early death [1].
PV impairs dilatation of affected pulmonary blood vessels,
impeding pulmonary blood flow during exercise. This eventually
leads to pulmonary hypertension and exercise intolerance.
Initially, the degree of exercise limitation is determined by the
ability of the right ventricle to hypertrophy and maintain adequate
blood flow through the lungs. At this stage, pulmonary
hypertension might only be visible during exercise [2,3]. Over
time, vasculopathy progresses and the right ventricular reserve fails
to meet the pulmonary blood flow required for the increased O2
demand of exercise, leading to exertional dyspnea and fatigue and
physical signs of pulmonary hypertension.
Early detection of PV may be desirable since timely therapeutic
intervention improves outcomes in experimental models [4,5].
Additionally, treatment of patients with early PAH can delay
clinical worsening [6]. Pulmonary vasculopathy develops unevenly
in the lungs. Thus, abnormal gas exchange findings characteristic
of ventilation-perfusion mismatching, is an early abnormality
during cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) [7].
The gas exchange abnormalities during CPET in patients with
PV reflect hypoperfusion of well-ventilated acini. Thus, ventilation

(VE) is high compared to relatively low CO2 output (VCO2) and
reduced end-tidal PCO2 (PETCO2), manifesting hypoperfusion of
well-ventilated lung. In this study, we performed CPET in a group
of referred SSc patients, without previously known or suspected
PV. We expected that these patients would display heterogeneous
gas exchange patterns during exercise, which cannot be explained
by resting measurements alone. We hypothesized that we would
find characteristic gas exchange patterns that would enable us to
discriminate between the different causes of exercise intolerance,
based on the exercise pathophysiology. We hypothesized that
some of the patients would show gas exchange patterns during
exercise that are characteristically found in patients with overt
pulmonary vascular pathophysiology.
Methods
Ethics statement
This study was conducted in accordance with Good Clinical
Practices and the current version of the revised Declaration of
Helsinki [8]. The local Los Angeles Biomedical Research
Institutional Review Board approved the protocol. A written
informed consent was obtained from each patient prior to
enrollment.
Study population
We prospectively screened 32 SSc patients referred from the
Rheumatology Clinic at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center for CPET
in order to determine if they had evidence of PV. Prior to referral,
all patients had chest X-rays and/or high-resolution chest CT￾scans. All patients had echocardiography with estimation of
pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) prior to referral. Patients with
estimated systolic PAP .35 mmHg, were excluded.
All patients had been diagnosed with SSc according to the
criteria of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) [9]. One
patient refused to perform CPET and another could not perform
CPET because of joint stiffness. Thus, thirty patients performed
CPET.
Evaluations
6-minute walk test. All patients performed an unencour￾aged, standardized 6-minute walk test (6MWD), at least one hour
before or after CPET [10].
Pulmonary function testing. Total lung capacity (TLC),
forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expired volume in one second
(FEV1), diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) and
alveolar volume (VA) were all measured as part of CPET and are
expressed as percent predicted.
Assessment of restrictive lung disease. Restrictive lung
disease was assessed by a combination of resting pulmonary
function tests (PFTs), including diffusion capacity for carbon
monoxide (DLCO), by Chest X-ray (CXR) and by high-resolution
computed tomography (HRCT). An HRCT was performed if
there were abnormalities in PFTs or CXR. An HRCT was not
performed in patients with normal PFTs and a normal CXR, or a
definite diagnosis of ILD based on these two measurements.
The available HRCT-scans in patients with suspected ILD (20
out of 30) were analyzed for signs of pulmonary venous occlusive
disease (PVOD). Main characteristics were enlarged mediastinal
lymph nodes, alveolar hemorrhage, centrilobular ground glass
opacities and septal lines on HRCT.
Cardiopulmonary exercise testing. CPET was performed
with upright cycling on a stationary cycle ergometer. The exercise
protocol consisted of 3 minutes of rest and 3 minutes of unloaded
cycling, followed by an incremental work rate between 5 and 15
watts per minute up to the patients’ maximum tolerance, then 3
minutes of recovery. Gas exchange was measured breath-by￾breath during the test, using a MedGraphics CPX-Ultima gas
exchange system (Medical Graphics Corporation, St. Paul,
Minnesota). Equipment was calibrated as previously described
[11]. ECG and pulse oximetry were continuously monitored and
blood pressure was measured every two minutes. Minute
ventilation (VE), heart rate (HR), VO2/HR, VO2, VCO2,
VCO2 vs VO2, VE/VO2, VE/VCO2, tidal volume (VT) vs VE,
end-tidal PO2 (PETO2) and PCO2 (PETCO2) and the respiratory
exchange ratio (RER) were averaged every 10 seconds. The
anaerobic threshold (AT) was determined from gas exchange, by
the V-slope method as previously described [12], in all patients.
The AT was derived from a plot with VO2 (x-axis) and VCO2 (y￾axis) on equal axis scaling, and was recognized as the point where
VCO2 started to increase faster than VO2. AT prediction was
performed as previously described [13,14]. The other key variables
were calculated and plotted as previously described [15,16]. All
studies were independently reviewed by two authors (DD and
KW). Disagreements were adjudicated after review by a third
author (JH), and consensus agreement among all three.
Categorizing Exercise Impairment
Patients with known severe heart or lung disease limiting
exercise, or individuals with known PAH, were not referred by the
Rheumatologists. An additional two patients with uninterpretable
cardiopulmonary exercise test results were not included in the
analysis (2 of 30 patients). The first patient stopped during the
unloaded cycling phase due to joint pain. The second patient had
a very noisy and chaotic breathing pattern. For both of these
patients, peak VO2, the AT and VE/VCO2 at the AT could not be
accurately determined. Thus, 28 patients were available for
analysis. Figure 1 presents the algorithm utilized. Disagreement in
the blinded interpretation of the CPET studies occurred in 2 of 28
interpretable cases. Agreement was reached in these two cases by
review of a third author. The normal category included those with
a normal peak VO2, normal anaerobic threshold (AT) normal
ventilation-perfusion matching, and no exercise-induced hypox￾emia (6 of 28 patients). The normal category also included six
patients with a reduced peak VO2, but with normal AT, no
abnormality in ventilation-perfusion matching or exercise-induced
hypoxemia and an RER at peak exercise below 1.0, indicating
submaximal effort. These patients were categorized as not being
limited by heart or lung disease. Thus, 12 of the 28 patients were
categorized as normal.
Patients were categorized in the left ventricular dysfunction
(LVD) group if they had a reduced peak VO2, AT, peak O2-pulse
and D VO2/DWR - but without ventilation-perfusion mismatch or
exercise-induced hypoxemia or RER at peak exercise ,1.0. (5 of
28 patients were in this category).
Patients were categorized in the PV group if they had a reduced
peak VO2 and AT, reduced peak O2-pulse and DVO2/DWR, and
ventilation-perfusion mismatch (elevated VE/VCO2 at the AT or
at the ventilatory compensation point (VCP) following AT). In
addition, based on prior research [17,18], suspected PV was
separated from LVD by a decreasing PETCO2 from the start of
exercise to AT (9 of 28 patients were in this category), in contrast to
an increasing PETCO2 in LVD and normal subjects. Two other
patients showed rising PETCO2 during exercise but were classified
as suspected PV secondary to their restrictive lung disease with
parallel loss of pulmonary capillary volume (low TLC and DLCO
with normal FEV1/FVC), however breathing reserve was thought
to be adequate without mechanical ventilatory limitation at peak
exercise. This is based on a prior study [19] showing that lung
Gas Exchange in Scleroderma

restriction from pulmonary fibrosis, before functional lung
restriction, is accompanied by exercise limiting PV.
Statistical analysis
A total of 28 of the SSc patients referred, with interpretable
CPET studies, were analyzed; they were divided into 3 major
categories: normal, LVD and PV, as described above. Continuous
variables are expressed as mean 6 SD. The three groups were
individually compared to each other. Differences were analyzed
using one way ANOVA, followed by Holm-Sidak testing for
multiple comparisons. Nominal data were analyzed by Chi-square
test for multiple groups. In all cases, a p value ,0.05 was
considered statistically significant.
Results
Table 1 shows the demographics according to diagnostic category.
All patients tolerated CPET well, and there were no adverse events.
Gas Exchange Patterns
Figure 2 shows how the 15 variables taken from the CPET 9-
panel plots of two representative SSc patients were analyzed.
Figure 2a shows an SSc patient with a normal CPET response;
Figure 2b shows another SSc patient with PV. The 4 arrows in
Figures 2a and 2b correspond to the 4 branch-point parameters
shown in Figure 1. The legend for figure 2 provides further detail.
Table 2 shows the 6 minute walk distance, key pulmonary
function measurements, the presence of restrictive lung disease,
pulse oximetry, and seven CPET parameters by diagnostic
categories. Six patients achieved their predicted peak VO2, and
another six stopped exercise prematurely without evidence of
cardiovascular or pulmonary limitation. All 12 had linear increases
in HR vs VO2 relationship towards their predicted value, normal
AT, O2-pulse, and VE/VCO2 @ AT, as exemplified in figure 2a.
We classified all 12 as normal. The other 16 patients achieved a
symptom-limited test below their predicted peak VO2, and also
had additional abnormalities. Of these 16, 5 were classified as
LVD and 11 were classified as PV. Two of the latter also had
significant restrictive lung disease with reduced FVC, TLC and
DLCO. No patients were limited by obstructive lung disease, all
had an adequate breathing reserve at peak exercise. In the patients
who underwent HRCT due to clinical suspicion of interstitial lung
disease (ILD), presence of ILD was found among all groups, with a
trend to higher occurrence in the PV group. However, this
difference did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.07).
None of these patients showed signs of PVOD.
Figure 1. Categorizing referred SSc patients with normal and reduced exercise capacity, using cardiopulmonary exercise testing.
Exercise intolerance was attributed to left ventricular dysfunction or pulmonary vascular disease. Normal is defined as either: a) normal in all
cardiovascular and ventilatory aspects of exercise gas exchange, including normal ventilation-perfusion matching and normal peak VO2, or b)
reduced peak VO2 with normal AT and no gas exchange abnormalities suggestive of heart, lung or pulmonary vascular disease. Diamonds (branch￾points) address specific data: Branch-point 1: Right branch: If the peak VO2 is $75% of predicted with normal VE/VCO2 and PETCO2 @ AT and non￾ventilatory limitation, the patient is considered to have normal heart and lung function. Left branch includes all with peak VO2 ,75%. Branch-point 2:
If the AT is normal and ventilation-perfusion matching and lung mechanics are normal (right branch), the patient is considered to be limited by poor
effort and not limited by heart or lung disease. If the AT is reduced (left branch), the patient is likely to have left ventricular dysfunction or pulmonary
vasculopathy. Branch-point 3: The VE/VCO2 @AT was used to assess matching of ventilation to perfusion. All patients with pulmonary vasculopathy
would have ventilation/perfusion mismatching and an elevated VE/VCO2. A cut-off value of $34 was selected. If not elevated, they were considered
to have left ventricular dysfunction. Branch point 4: PETCO2 usually increases from the beginning of exercise to the AT in patients with normal
cardiopulmonary function and patients with left ventricular dysfunction (right branch). However, it usually decreases in patients with pulmonary
arterial hypertension (left branch). Nine of the 11 patients classified as pulmonary vasculopathy had a decreasing PETCO2. Two had either no change
or increasing PETCO2 from the start of exercise to the AT, possibly due to lung restriction. However, they hyperventilated above their AT. If the patient
had moderate to severe restriction and marked decrease in DLCO, this signified interstitial lung disease with pulmonary vasculopathy.

Figure 2. Gas exchange response to exercise in two SSc patients. Nine panel plots of a patient with normal exercise performance (Fig. 2a)
and one with pulmonary vasculopathy (Fig. 2b). The protocol consisted of a 3-minute resting period, followed by 3 minutes of very-low-level cycle
exercise, and then increasing cycle workload to the patient’s maximum tolerance. Points are 20-second averages. Panel 1 is plot of ventilation against
time. Panel 2 is plot of heart rate and O2-pulse against time. Panel 3 is plot of O2 uptake (VO2), CO2 output (VCO2) and work rate against time. Panel 4
is plot of minute ventilation (VE) against VCO2. Panel 5 is plot of VCO2 and HR against VO2. Panel 6 is plot of ventilatory equivalent for VO2 (VE/VO2)
and VCO2 (VE/VCO2) against time. Panel 7 is plot of tidal volume against minute ventilation, with resting maximum voluntary ventilation on the X-axis
and inspiratory capacity and vital capacity, measured at rest, on the Y-axis. Panel 8 is plot of gas exchange ratio (RER) against time. Panel 9 is plot of
end tidal pO2 (PETO2), end tidal pCO2 (PETCO2) and pulse oximeter arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation against time. The normal subject (figure 2a) is a
59 year old female with scleroderma. Peak VO2 and AT are normal (panels 3 and 5) There are no signs of impaired oxygen flow, or ventilation/
perfusion mismatching during exercise. Peripheral oxyhemoglobin saturation does not decrease during exercise. There is adequate breathing reserve.
The subject with suspected pulmonary vasculopathy (figure 2b) is a 37 year old female with scleroderma. Peak VO2 and AT are reduced (panel 3,
panel 5). Ventilatory equivalents are elevated and decrease only slightly during exercise (panel 6). End-tidal pCO2 is low and decreases during exercise
(panel 9), consistent with reduced gas exchange efficiency rather than voluntary hyperventilation (RER is normal, panel 8). The patient stopped
exercise because of leg pain. Four arrows are placed on each of Figures 2a and 2b that correspond to the branch-points described in Figure 1, Arrow
1 points to the peak VO2 in panel 3 (branch-point 1). Arrow 2 points to the AT in panel 5 (branch-point 2). Arrow 3 points to the VE/VCO2 at the AT in
panel 6 (branch-point 3). Arrow 4 points to the changing PETCO2 from start of exercise to AT in panel 9.

Exercise Capacity
The cause of exercise limitation discerned from all 28
interpretable cardiopulmonary exercise tests was determined using
the algorithm shown in Figure 1. Its branch-points systematically
examined each of the key parameters from the 9-panel plots
(Figure 2). Figure 2 shows where the branch-point data were
obtained in each patient’s 9-panel plot. Exercise capacity was
significantly reduced due to identifiable defects in 16 of the 28
patients. In these patients, peak VO2 and VO2 at AT were ,75% of
the absolute predicted value and/or oxygen pulse reached a plateau
at a significantly reduced value above the AT (Figure 2b, panel 2).
Several measurements in Table 2 are of special interest. FVC
values were mildly reduced, 6MWD was moderately reduced, and
DLCO values were markedly reduced from normal in the PV
group (p,0.001). However, reductions were qualitatively similar
in the two cardiovascular disorders, the difference did not reach
statistical significance. The FVC/DLCO ratio showed the same
results: Only the normal and the PV group showed a difference
which reached statistical significance (p = 0.01). The difference
between the normal and the LVD group, as well as the difference
between the PV and the LVD group were not statistically
significant (p = 0.17 and p = 0.37, respectively).
Peak VO2, AT, peak O2 pulse and D VO2/DWR were all
reduced in patients with PV and LVD, but the magnitudes and
patterns of these reductions did not distinguish the two disorders.
As single parameters, only PETCO2@AT (p = 0.004), VE/
VCO2@AT (p = 0.002) and the changes in PETCO2 from early
exercise to the AT (p = 0.002) distinguished LVD from PV.
The directional change in PETCO2 at the start of exercise to the
AT (DPETCO2) tends to be negative (decreases to the AT), as has
been previously shown in patients with idiopathic PAH [17,18]. In
contrast, PETCO2 increases from the start of exercise to the AT in
the normal subjects and the patients with LVD (Fig. 3). There was
no significant difference between the normal (3.262.3 mm Hg)
and LVD (3.962.0) groups (p = 0.93) in the PETCO2 change.
However, the PV group (21.362.6) differed significantly from
both (p,0.001 and p = 0.002, respectively).
Figure 4 shows the relationships of PETCO2 to VE/VCO2 at
the AT of all patients. Although there is some overlap, most
patients with pulmonary vasculopathy had a lower PETCO2 and
higher VE/VCO2 than the normal and LVD groups.
The FEV1/FVC ratio was normal in all subjects. However, on
average, our patients with PV tended to have lower FVC than the
normal and LVD groups, (Table 2). To distinguish those patients
with PV and restriction from those without or less restriction, we
plotted the FVC against VE/VCO2 and PETCO2 at AT (Figures 5a
and 5b). Approximately half of the patients with ventilation￾perfusion mismatch (high VE/VCO2 and low PETCO2 at the AT)
had significant reductions in FVC, while the others had PV with
no or minimal restriction (normal FVC).

Discussion
Previous studies have described lung gas exchange abnormal￾ities at rest and during exercise in SSc patients [20]. However, this
is the first study to show that abnormal gas exchange patterns
during exercise, characteristic of PV, can be seen in patients with
SSc without elevated pulmonary artery pressure on echocardiog￾raphy or of having pulmonary vascular disease based on clinical

suspicion. These abnormal CPET patterns may represent early
PV, which with time, may lead to clinical and symptomatic
pulmonary hypertension at rest.
Using CPET, we found evidence of possible PV in an SSc patient
population, which was asymptomatic for the disease. A decreased
peak VO2 along with a reduced AT has been the primary marker of
reduced exercise capacity in patients with cardiovascular limitations
to exercise [21]. However, patients with multi-organ diseases like
scleroderma, are frequently exercise-limited with unclear cause.
The 6MWD cannot be expected to define pathophysiology or
differentiate causes of reduced exercise capacity. Therefore
assessment of measures beyond 6MWD and peak VO2 measure￾ments is needed to identify the specific pathophysiology underlying
exercise intolerance.
In this study, we hypothesized that measures of ventilatory
efficiency, specifically PETCO2 and VE/VCO2 and their patterns
of change during exercise, added to other gas exchange measures
evaluating peak and sustainable cardiac output, or VO2, could be
used to differentiate patterns which indicate possible PV from
other causes of exercise gas exchange abnormalities. Elevated VE/

VCO2 values at the AT or VCP are important non-invasive
measurements of ventilation-perfusion mismatching due to loss of
pulmonary vasculature, and can be identified without maximal
exercise. The additional finding of a low PETCO2@AT was even
more discriminatory when used to differentiate early LVD from
early PV (Table 2).
Because of loss of perfusion to ventilated lung, there is less CO2
laden blood to release CO2 to the airspaces for a given ventilation
in patients with suspected PV. Thus, to eliminate the metabolic
CO2, ventilation must increase resulting in an elevated ratio of VE
to VCO2. In left ventricular failure, it is also common for portions
of the lung to be well-ventilated, but be poorly perfused. Thus,
VE/VCO2 is commonly used as an index of the severity of LVD
[22,23]. Due to its pathogenesis, VE/VCO2 should invariably be
increased in patients with PV [18,24,25]. Because of the loss of
vascularity to lung acini, PETCO2 is diluted in proportion to the
fraction of underperfused acini. Thus, PETCO2 is decreased as
VE/VCO2 is increased, the degree depending on disease severity.
In less severe stages of pulmonary vascular disease, small increases
in VE/VCO2 are accompanied by large decreases in PETCO2
[18] (Figure 4). Thus, a reduced PETCO2 at the AT or VCP is a
valuable marker of blood vessel loss, and may be sensitive in
detecting early pulmonary vascular disease.
It has also been shown, in the transition from the start of exercise
to the AT, that PETCO2 tends to decrease in PAH, whereas the
PETCO2 tends to increase in LVD [17]. This observation appears to
occur in SSc patients with suspected PV as well.
Figure 5 relates the degree of lung restriction (reduced FVC) to
the elevation of VE/VCO2 (Fig. 5a) and dilution of PCO2 (Fig. 5b)
at the AT or VCP. All three groups had reductions in FVC, but it
is mainly the PV group that had the abnormally high VE/VCO2
and low PETCO2 values. This might become therapeutically
relevant in patients with SSc and borderline pulmonary hyper￾tension. Presumably, the best candidates for specific therapy would
be those patients with the highest VE/VCO2 and lowest PETCO2
values and least lung restriction. However, the validation of this
hypothesis is subject to further studies.
Study limitations
Our diagnostic algorithm categorizing exercise pathophysiolo￾gy, based on patterns of exercise gas exchange, was designed to
identify scleroderma patients with characteristic patterns of PV
and normal pulmonary artery pressure on echocardiography. We
did not perform right-heart catheterization in our patients, as the
study aim was to detect patterns of early PV in patients who might
not have yet progressed to clinical resting pulmonary hyperten￾sion, so that an elevated PAP during a resting right heart
catheterization might not have been evident, given a normal
systolic PAP on echocardiography. Only long-term longitudinal
evaluation of these patients will enable us to discern the rates of
progression of these abnormalities, and may provide insight into
the natural course of PV in patients with SSc.
True dead space/tidal volume ratio can only be calculated using
arterial blood gas measurements. We did not do arterial blood
sampling during exercise in order to avoid discomfort, and the
potential for sudden peripheral vasospasm in SSc patients.
However, increased VE/VCO2 beyond that found in normal
subjects [26], and simultaneously decreased PETCO2 at the AT, as
well as specific changes in the patterns of these two variables as
work rate is increased, strongly suggest that dead space ventilation
is increased.
Although more patients with systemic sclerosis suffer from the
limited type than from the diffuse type, the distribution between
diffuse and limited SSc may have been shifted towards patients
with the limited form of the disease in our cohort, as only a few
patients were found to have the diffuse form. Thus, our findings
might be influenced by an overrepresentation of patients with the
limited form of SSc.
The differential diagnosis of pulmonary veno-occlusive disease
(PVOD) in SSc patients, an important clinical question, is
challenging. We could not definitely exclude PVOD in our
subjects, as this would require histological confirmation. However,
this procedure is not recommended as it carries a significant risk
[27]. HRCT, which was performed in all patients with suspicion of
ILD (20 out of 30 patients) did not show any findings consistent
with PVOD such as enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, alveolar
hemorrhage, or septal lines in any of the patients. In the remaining
10 patients, HRCT was not indicated as clinical status, PFT, chest
x-ray and (except for one asymptomatic patient) VE/VCO2 were
normal, and hence the probability of PVOD is considered very
low. Furthermore, in these patients the nadir SpO2 during exercise
were significantly higher than the values found in PVOD patients
reported by Montani et al [28].
We conclude that routine CPET may be a sensitive method to
detect developing exercise intolerance and provide additional
information on the mechanism of exercise limitation in SSc. More
detailed analysis of the specific pathophysiological mechanism
underlying the developing exercise intolerance, such as PV and
LVD, might clarify the treatment direction and therefore might
help in preventing progression. However, there are no data to
prove this, and further investigations are warranted.
