Abstract
Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common type of developmental abnormality in humans, 
and is a leading cause for substantially increased morbidity and mortality in affected individuals. 
Increasing studies demonstrates a pivotal role of genetic defects in the pathogenesis of CHD, and 
presently mutations in more than 60 genes have been associated with CHD. Nevertheless, CHD is of 
pronounced genetic heterogeneity, and the genetic basis underpinning CHD in a large proportion of 
patients remains unclear. In the present study, the whole coding exons and splicing donors/acceptors of 
the MEF2C gene, which codes for a transcription factor essential for normal cardiovascular 
development, were sequenced in 200 unrelated patients affected with CHD, and a novel heterozygous 
missense mutation, p.L38P, was identified in an index patient with patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) and 
ventricular septal defect (VSD). Genetic scan of the mutation carrier’s family members available showed 
that the mutation was present in all affected family members but absent in unaffected family members. 
Analysis of the proband’s pedigree revealed that the mutation co-segregated with PDA, which was 
transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait with complete penetrance. The mutation changed the 
amino acid that was completely conserved evolutionarily, and did not exist in 300 unrelated, 
ethnically-matched healthy individuals used as controls. Functional deciphers by using a dual-luciferase 
reporter assay system unveiled that the mutant MEF2C protein had a significantly reduced 
transcriptional activity. Furthermore, the mutation significantly diminished the synergistic activation 
between MEF2C and GATA4, another cardiac core transcription factor that has been causally linked to 
CHD. In conclusion, this is the first report on the association of a MEF2C loss-of-function mutation with 
an increased vulnerability to CHD in humans, which provides novel insight into the molecular 
mechanisms underlying CHD, implying potential implications for early diagnosis and timely prophylaxis 
of CHD.

Introduction
Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most 
common type of developmental defect in humans, 
occurring in almost 3% of neonates when including 
bicuspid aortic valve, and accounting for

approximately one-third of all major birth defects 
[1-3]. Each year about 1.35 million newborns are born 
with CHD worldwide, with an estimated incidence of 
1% in live births and as high as 10% in still births [1,2]. 
As a group of structural abnormalities of the heart, 
CHD is usually classified into 25 different clinical 
types, including ventricular septal defect (VSD), atrial 
septal defect, atrioventricular canal defect, patent 
ductus arteriosus (PDA), tetralogy of Fallot, double 
outlet right ventricle, transposition of the great 
arteries, interrupted aortic arch, aortic stenosis, 
truncus arteriosus, coarctation of the aorta, tricuspid 
atresia, pulmonary stenosis (PS), pulmonary atresia,
hypoplastic left heart, single ventricle, and abnormal 
pulmonary venous connection [1]. Although mild
cardiovascular anomalies can resolve spontaneously 
[1], major defects may require timely surgical 
treatment and otherwise can result in degraded
health-related quality of life [4], reduced exercise 
performance [5], retarded central neural development 
and brain injury [6-9], cerebral and pulmonary
thromboembolism [10,11], infective endocarditis 
[12-16], pulmonary arterial hypertension [17-22],
chronic heart failure [23-26], supraventricular and 
ventricular arrhythmias [27-31] and sudden cardiac 
death [32-37]. Therefore, CHD represents the most 
prevalent cause of infant birth defect-related demises, 
with roughly 24% of infants who died of a birth defect 
having a cardiovascular deformity [1]. Due to vast
advances in medical care and surgical management of 
CHD during the last 50 years, today 95 % of CHD 
patients survive to adulthood, which has resulted in a 
growing population of adults living with CHD, and 
now there are more adults living with CHD than 
children [38-41]. However, the morbidity and 
mortality rates in adult CHD patients are much higher 
compared with the general population [38-41]. 
Despite important clinical significance, the causes
responsible for CHD in the majority of patients
remain unknown.
Previous studies have demonstrated that the 
etiology of CHD is complex and is associated with 
both environmental and genetic causes [2,3,41-44]. 
The well-established environmental risk factors 
contributing to CHD encompass maternal exposures 
to toxic chemicals, drugs or ionizing radiation during 
the first trimester of pregnancy and maternal 
conditions such as viral infection, immune disorder
and diabetes mellitus [41,42]. However, 
epidemiologic studies strongly suggest genetic defects 
as the predominant cause of CHD, which is 
predominantly transmitted in an autosomal dominant 
pattern in the family, though familial transmission of 
CHD is also observed in other inheritance modes,
including autosomal recessive and X-linked fashions
[41-44]. Genetically, regardless of chromosomal
duplications and deletions including trisomy 21, 
trisomy 18 and 22q11.2 microdeletion [45], more than
60 genes, including those encoding cardiac 
transcription factors, cardiac structural proteins, 
signaling transducer molecules and chromatin 
modifiers, have been causally linked to CHD in 
humans [41-89]. Of these CHD-associated genes, most
code for cardiac transcription factors, including the 
homeobox-containing protein NKX2-5, zinc-finger 
proteins GATA4, GATA5 and GATA6, and T-box 
transcription factors TBX1, TBX5 and TBX20 [89,90]. 
Theses transcription factors show partially 
overlapping expression profiles and functional 
characteristics during embryonic cardiogenesis, 
suggesting that they constitute a regulatory network 
crucial for normal cardiovascular development [90]. 
Nevertheless, CHD is a very heterogeneous disease, 
and the genetic determinants for CHD in the majority 
of patients remain unclear.
As a member of the MADS (MCM1, agamous, 
deficiens, serum response factor)-box containing 
transcription factor family, the myocyte enhancer 
factor 2C (MEF2C) is highly expressed in various cells,
and plays an important role in transcriptional 
regulation of all three muscle lineages, including 
cardiac precursor cells and differentiated 
cardiomyocytes during embryogenesis [91]. In mice, 
targeted disruption of the Mef2c gene led to
embryonic death due to loss of the right ventricle of 
the heart, failure of the heart to undergo rightward 
looping morphogenesis [91]. Additionally, in fetal 
mice ablation of the Mef2c gene in the anterior second 
heart field, a late differentiating population of cardiac 
progenitors, caused a spectrum of outflow tract 
malformations ranging from overriding aorta to 
double outlet right ventricle and transposition of the 
great arteries [92]. These findings make it reasonable
to screen MEF2C as a preferred candidate gene for 
CHD in different cohorts of patients.

from the Chinese Han population from January 2014 
to December 2016, including 110 males and 90 females 
with an average age of 4.2 ± 3.5 years, ranging from 0 
to 15 years of age. The available family members of 
the index patient harboring an identified MEF2C
mutation were also enrolled. A total of 300 healthy,
ethnicity- and geographic-matched individuals were 
registered as controls, including 162 males and 138
females at a mean age of 4.1 ± 3.3 years, ranging from 
1 to 14 years of age. Study participants underwent 
comprehensive clinical evaluation including
individual and familial histories, medical records, 
electrocardiogram and echocardiography. Magnetic 
resonance imaging, cardiac angiography or cardiac 
surgery was performed when indicated. Diagnosis of 
CHD was made according to the echocardiography, 
magnetic resonance imaging, angiography or direct 
view during cardiac surgery. The patients with 
known chromosomal abnormalities or syndromic 
CHD, such as DiGeorge syndrome, Turner syndrome, 
Marfan syndrome, Holt–Oram syndrome and Down 
syndrome, were excluded from the study.
Genetic screening of the human MEF2C gene
Peripheral venous whole-blood samples were 
collected from all the study participants and genomic 
DNA was isolated from blood leukocytes using the 
Wizard Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Promega, 
Madison, WI, USA) according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions for DNA isolation. The coding exons and 
flanking exon–intron boundaries of the MEF2C gene 
(transcript variant 1) were sequenced in 200 unrelated 
patients with CHD and in 300 ethnicity- and 
geographic-matched control individuals. The 
referential genomic DNA sequence of the human 
MEF2C gene (accession no. NC_000005.10) was 
derived from the Nucleotide database at the National 
Center for Biotechnology Information 
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_00000
5.10?from=88718241&to=88904105&report=genbank
&strand=true). The primers utilized to amplify the 
coding regions and splice junction sites of MEF2C by 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were designed as 
shown in Table 1, with the online Primer-BLAST 
program (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/
primer-blast). PCR was performed in a 25 μL mixture 
containing 20–40 ng of genomic DNA, 1× Buffer 
(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), 0.5 μM of each primer, 
0.2 mM dNTPs and 0.02 U/μL of HotStar Taq DNA 
Polymerase (Qiagen). PCR cycling was carried out on 
Veriti Thermal Cycler (Applied Biosystems, Waltham, 
MA, USA) using a pre-denaturation cycle at 95°C for 
15 min followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C 
for 30 s, annealing of primers at 62 °C for 30 s and 
extension at 72 °C for 1 min as well as a final extension 
step at 72 °C for 6 min. Amplicons were fractionated 
by electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel and purified 
with the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen). Both 
strands of each PCR product were sequenced with the 
BigDye® Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit 
(Applied Biosystems) under an ABI PRISM 3130 XL 
DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems) according to the 
protocols. The identified MEF2C variant was 
confirmed by sequencing two independent 
PCR-generated amplicons from the same patient. The 
position of an exonic sequence variation was 
numbered according to the reference sequence of the 
MEF2C mRNA transcript variant 1 at the Nucleotide 
database (accession no. NM_002397.4). Additionally, 
the identified sequence variation was queried in the 
single nucleotide polymorphism database 
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP), the human 
gene mutation database (http://www.hgmd.org), the 
1000 Genome Project database (http://www.
1000genomes.org), and the Exome Aggregation 
Consortium (http://exac.broadinstitute.org) to 
confirm its novelty.

Sequence alignment of MEF2C across species
Conservation of the amino acid altered by a 
missense allelic variant was evaluated by aligning the 
protein of human MEF2C to those of chimpanzee, 
monkey, dog, cattle, mouse, rat, fowl, zebrafish, fruit 
fly, mosquito and frog using the online MUSCLE 
software (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/homologe

Prediction of the causative potential of a new 
MEF2C variation in silico
The disease-causing potential of a new MEF2C
variation was predicted by MutationTaster 
(http://www.mutationtaster.org), PolyPhen-2 
(http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph2), PROVEAN 
(http://provean.jcvi.org/index.php) and SIFT 
(http://sift.jcvi.org/www/SIFT_enst_submit.html).
Plasmids and site-targeted mutagenesis
Human heart cDNAs were prepared as 
described previously [57]. With the human heart 
cDNAs as templates, the full-length coding sequences 
for human MEF2C gene (transcript variant 1; 
accession no. NM_002397.4) were amplified by PCR 
using the pfuUltra high-fidelity DNA polymerase 
(Stratagene, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and a pair of 
primers (forward primer: 5’-TGGGCTAGCAGAG￾AGAGAAGAAAAACGGG-3’; reverse primer: 
5’-CCAGCGGCCGCACTAGTAAGTAATAATCTGA
-3’). The amplified products were doubly digested by 
restriction enzymes NheI and NotI (TaKaRa, Dalian, 
Liaoning, China). The resultant product with a length 
of 1493 base pairs was separated by 1.5% agarose gel 
electrophoresis, extracted with the QIAquick Gel 
Extraction Kit (Qiagen), and then inserted into the 
NheI-NotI sites of the pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen, 
Carlsbad, CA, USA) to produce a recombinant 
expression plasmid MEF2C-pcDNA3.1. The identified 
mutation was introduced into the wild-type 
MEF2C-pcDNA3.1 plasmid by site-directed 
mutagenesis using the QuickChange II XL 
Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) with a 
complementary pair of primers (Forward: 
5′-ATGAGCTGAGCGTGCCGTGTGACTGTGAGAT￾3′; Reverse: 5’-ATCTCACAGTCACACGGCACG￾CTCAGCTCAT-3′) according to the manufacturer’s 
protocols, and was validated by sequencing. The 
recombinant expression plasmid GATA4-pSSRa and 
the reporter plasmid ANF-luciferase (ANF-luc), 
which contains the 2600-bp 5’-untranslated region of 
the ANF gene and expresses firefly luciferase, were 
kindly provided by Dr. Ichiro Shiojima from Chiba 
University School of Medicine, Japan.
Cell transfection and luciferase assays
HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified 
Eagle’s media containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 
μg/ml streptomycin and 100 U/ml penicillin in an 
incubator with 5% CO2 at 37°C. Cells were seeded in 
24-well plates 24 h before transfection with various 
plasmids using the Lipofectamine 3000® reagent 
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions. The pGL4.75 (Promega) vector 
expressing a renilla luciferase was co-transfected into 
the cells as an internal control to normalize 
transfection efficiency. For transient transfection 
experiments, HeLa cells were transfected with 1.0 μg 
of wild-type MEF2C-pcDNA3.1, 1.0 μg of 
L38P-mutant MEF2C-pcDNA3.1, 0.5 μg of wild-type 
MEF2C-pcDNA3.1, or 0.5 μg of wild-type 
MEF2C-pcDNA3.1 together with 0.5 μg of 
L38P-mutant MEF2C-pcDNA3.1, in combination with 
1.0 μg of ANF-luc and 0.04 μg of pGL4.75 (Promega). 
To evaluate the synergistic transcriptional activation, 
the same amount (0.4 μg) of expression plasmid DNA 
(empty pcDNA3.1, wild-type MEF2C-pcDNA3.1, 
L38P-mutant MEF2C-pcDNA3.1 or GATA4-pSSRa) 
was used alone or together, in the presence of 1.0 μg 
of ANF-luc and 0.04 μg of pGL4.75. The empty 
plasmid pcDNA3.1 was used as a negative control. 
Transfections were conducted in three independent 
experiments in triplicate. Cells were harvested and 
lysed 36 h after transfection. Luciferase activity of the
lysates was measured using the Dual-Luciferase 
Reporter Assay System (Promega) according to the 
manufacturer’s manual. Firefly luciferase data was 
normalized to the renilla luciferase readings, and the 
results were expressed as mean ± standard deviations 
(SD).
Statistical analysis
The data was statistically analyzed using the 
SPSS software package for Windows, version 17.0 
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Continuous variables
were expressed as mean ± SD. Categorical variables 
were expressed as a number and percentage. 
Comparison of continuous variables between two 
groups was performed using Student’s unpaired 
t-test; whereas categorical variables were compared 
with Pearson’s χ2 test or Fisher’s exact test, when 
appropriate. A 2–tailed probability value of P < 0.05 
was considered to be significantly different.
Results
Clinical features of the study participants
In the present study, 200 unrelated CHD patients 
was clinically investigated in contrast to 300 unrelated 
healthy control individuals. The patients and controls 
were matched in ethnicity, gender, age, and 
geography. All the patients had echocardiogram￾documented CHD, of whom approximately 19% had 
a positive family history of CHD. The control subjects 
were healthy with a negative family history of CHD, 
and their echocardiograms were normal with no 
evidence of cardiovascular structural deformities. The 
demographic and clinical characteristics of the cohort 
of CHD patients that participated in the study are 
summarized in Table 2.

Identification of a novel MEF2C mutation
Sequence analysis of the MEF2C gene in our 
patient’s cohort led to identification of a 
non-synonymous heterozygous variant in a male 
patient who was one year old, with a mutational 
prevalence of 0.5%. Specifically, a substitution of 
cytosine for thymine at the second nucleotide of 
codon 38 (c.113T>C), which was predicted to result in 
the change of leucine at amino acid position 38 into 
proline (p.L38P), was detected in a boy with PDA and 
VSD, who had positive family history of CHD. The 
DNA sequence chromatograms that exhibited the 
heterozygous allelic mutation of c.113T>C and its 
homozygous wild-type control base are shown in 
Figure 1A. A schematic drawing of the MEF2C 
protein displaying the functionally important 
structural domains with approximated localization of 
the mutation found in the current study is illustrated 
in Figure 1B. The missense mutation was neither 
discovered in the 300 control subjects nor reported in 
the single nucleotide polymorphism, human gene 
mutation, 1000 Genomes Project and Exome 
Aggregation Consortium database (queried again in 
June 6, 2017). Genetic scan of the mutation carrier’s 
family members available revealed that the mutation 
was present in all the affected family members, but 
absent in unaffected family members. Analysis of the 
proband’s pedigree unveiled that the mutation 
co-segregated with PDA, which was transmitted as an 
autosomal dominant trait in the family with complete 
penetrance. Additionally, the proband’s father (II-5) 
and uncle (II-1) had also VSD and PS, respectively, 
while his grandfather (I-1) had also VSD and PS and 
died of heart failure at the age of 58 years. Besides, the 
affected adult family members had also stereotypic 
movements, mental retardation, and paroxysmal 
epilepsy. The pedigree structure of the proband’s
family is represented in Figure 1C. The clinical 
characteristics and molecular findings of the 
proband’s affected family members are listed in 
Table 3.

Evolutionary conservation of the altered 
amino acid
As shown in Figure 2, multiple alignments of the 
MEF2C protein sequences across species exhibited 
that the altered leucine at amino acid 38 was 
completely conserved evolutionarily.
A novel MEF2C variation predicted to be 
pathogenic
The identified MEF2C variation c.113T>C was 
predicted to be disease-causing with a p value of 1.000 
by MutationTaster, probably damaging with a score 
of 0.999 (sensitivity: 0.09; specificity: 0.99) by 
PolyPhen-2, deleterious with a PROVEAN score of 
-6.438 by PROVEAN, and damaging with a SIFT score 
of 0 and a median information content of 3.41 by SIFT.
Reduced transcriptional activity of MEF2C 
caused by the mutation
As shown in Figure 3, the same amount (1.0 μg) 
of wild-type and L38P-mutant MEF2C-pcDNA3.1 

Int. J. Med. Sci. 2017, Vol. 14

1148
plasmids transcriptionally activated the ANF
promoter by ～14 folds and ～2 folds, respectively. 
When 0.5 μg of wild-type MEF2C-pcDNA3.1 was 
used alone or together with 0.5 μg of L38P-mutant 
MEF2C-pcDNA3.1, the induced transcriptional 
activation of the ANF promoter was ～7-fold or ～
6-fold.
Diminished synergistic activation between 
MEF2C and GATA4 resulted from the 
mutation
As shown in Figure 4, in the presence of 0.4 μg of 
wild-type GATA4, the same amount (0.4 μg) of 
wild-type and L38P-mutant MEF2C activated the ANF
promoter by ～39 folds and ～14 folds, respectively; 
while in the absence of wild-type GATA4, the same 
amount (0.4 μg) of wild-type and L38P-mutant 
MEF2C activated the ANF promoter by ～4 folds and 
～2 folds, respectively.
Discussion
In the present study, a novel heterozygous
mutation (c.113T>C, equivalent to p.L38P) in the 
MEF2C gene was discovered in a family with PDA as 
well as VSD and PS. The missense mutation, which 
was absent in the 600 control chromosomes, 
co-segregated with CHD in the family with complete 
penetrance. Functional analyses demonstrated that 
the L38P-mutant MEF2C protein had a significantly 
diminished transcriptional activity. Furthermore, the 
mutation significantly decreased the synergistic 
transcriptional activation between MEF2C and 
GATA4, another cardiac core 
transcription factor that has been 
associated with CHD. Hence, it is 
very likely that genetically 
compromised MEF2C contributes 
to CHD in this family.
To date, there are four 
members of the MEF2 family 
found in vertebrates, 
encompassing MEF2A, MEF2B, 
MEF2C and MEF2D, of which 
MEF2B and MEF2C are firstly 
activated in the heart mesoderm 
at approximately embryonic day 
7.5; while MEF2A and MEF2D are 
expressed after birth for 24 hours 
[93]. MEF2C is widely expressed 
in many types of cells in vivo to 
regulate tissue-specific gene 
expression during embryonic 
period of eukaryote organisms, 
including cardiac muscle, skeletal 
muscle, neural, chondroid, 
immune and endothelial cells [93]. 
In humans, MEF2C maps on 
chromosome 5q14.3, which codes 
for several isoforms of proteins, 
including isoform 1 with 473 
amino acids. The human MEF2C 
protein contains five key 
structural domains, including 
MADS, MEF2, transcriptional 
activation domain 1 (TAD1), 
transcriptional activation domain 
2 (TAD2), and nuclear localization 
signal (NLS) [93]. The highly 
conserved MADS domain at the 
amino-terminus of MEF2C 
consists of 56 amino acids, and its

main role is to mediate DNA binding, dimerization, 
and interactions with co-factors. The MEF2 domain is 
adjoining the MADS domain and comprises 30 highly 
conserved amino acids, starting from amino acid 57 to 
amino acid 86. In combination with the MADS 
domain, the MEF2 domain plays an important role in 
mediating dimerization and DNA binding. The TAD1 
and TAD2 domains function as the transcriptional 
activators; while the NLS domain is located at the 
Carboxyl-terminus of MEF2C, which is responsible 
for nuclear translocation of the protein [93]. In the 
current study, the mutation detected in CHD patients 
was located at the MADS domain of MEF2C, and thus 
was anticipated to impair the transcriptional activity 
of MEF2C mainly by interfering with its binding to 
the promoters of target genes, including the ANF gene 
highly expressed in the heart during embryogenesis 
[94]. Functional deciphers demonstrated that the 
L38P-mutant MEF2C protein had significantly 
reduceded transcriptional activation of the ANF
promoter alone or in synergy with GATA4. These 
results suggest that haploinsufficiency for MEF2C is 
potentially an alternative pathological mechanism 
underlying CHD.
Association of MEF2C loss-of-function mutation 
with enhanced susceptibility to CHD may be partially 
explained by abnormal cardiovascular development. 
In fruit fly, there is a single Mef2 gene that encodes a 
protein with extensive homology to the MADS 
domains of the mammalian MEF2 proteins, and 
during embryonic development, its expression is 
initiated at gastrulation within mesodermal precursor 
cells in the ventral furrow and then becomes restricted 
to the somatic, cardiac, and visceral muscle lineages 
[95]. In the embryos of fruit fly, loss-of-function 
mutation of Mef2 gives rise to a block in the 
development of all three types of muscle cells, 
including cardiac, somatic and visceral muscle cells 
[95]. In zebrafish, there are two Mef2c genes, 
namely Mef2ca and Mef2cb, which are expressed 
similarly in the bilateral heart fields at the 
primitive heart tube stage, and knockdown of a single 
Mef2ca leads to delayed heart development, but 
mutants with loss of a single Mef2cb have a 
functional heart [96]. In frog, knocking down either 
Mef2c or Mef2d by corresponding antisense 
morpholino oligonucleotides results in 
congenital heart defects including morphological 
anomalies, pericardial edema, and brachycardia [97]. 
In mice, MEF2C is the first member of the MEF2 
family expressed during embryogenesis in cells of the 
cardiac mesoderm that form the primitive heart tube
[98], and targeted deletion of the Mef2c gene causes 
severe cardiac structural abnormalities and 
embryonic lethality in homozygous mutants due to 
the failure of heart tube to undergo looping 
morphogenesis and the absence of the right 
ventricular region of the heart [91]. Furthermore, in 
mice ablation of Mef2c in the anterior second heart 
field causes outflow tract defects, such as overriding 
aorta, double outlet right 
ventricle and 
transposition of the great 
arteries [92]. In humans, 
all four MEF2 transcript 
variants (MEF2A, 
MEF2B, MEF2C and
MEF2D) are expressed in 
all developmental stages 
of the heart [99]. More 
importantly, Kodo and 
colleagues made a 
sequence analysis of the
MEF2C gene in 256 
non-syndromic, 
non-familial patients 
with cardiac outflow tract 
defects, and identified a 
novel sequence variant 
(p.A103V) in a female 
patient with pulmonary 
atresia and VSD [100]. 
Functional assays using a 
luciferase reporter
showed that the

A103V-mutant MEF2C protein had a significantly 
increased transcriptional activity, and furthermore, 
overexpression of the A103V-mutant MEF2C in a fish 
model system disturbed early cardiac development 
[100]. Taken collectively, these findings together with 
the results of the current study indicate that 
genetically compromised MEF2C predisposes to CHD 
in humans.

Activation of the ANF promoter driven luciferase in HeLa cells by wild-type
MEF2C or L38P-mutant MEF2C (L38P), alone or together, showed significantly 
reduced transcriptional activity by the mutant protein. Three independent 
transfection experiments were conducted in triplicate for each expression 
plasmid, and mean and standard deviations are shown. ** indicates t = 10.7379, 
p = 0.00043; * indicates t = 6.29383, p = 0.00326, when compared with 
wild-type MEF2C (1.0 μg).

and GATA4 resulted from the mutation. In the presence of GATA4, activation 
of the ANF promoter driven luciferase reporter in HeLa cells by wild-type 
MEF2C or L38P-mutant MEF2C L38P) showed significantly diminished 
synergistic transcriptional activation between L38P-mutant MEF2C and GATA4. 
Three independent transfection experiments were done in triplicate for each 
expression plasmid, and mean and standard deviations are given. * indicates t = 
9.37232, p = 0.00072, when compared with the wild-type counterpart.
Interestingly, in the present study all the affected 
adult family members harboring the identified 
MEF2C mutation had also mental retardation, 
stereotypic movements, and paroxysmal epilepsy. 
Factually, the MEF2C gene plays a crucial role not 
only in myogenesis but also in neurogenesis, and 
MEF2C haploinsufficiency has been involved in the 
pathogenesis of central nervous system disease [101]. 
Clinically, the MEF2C haploinsufficiency syndrome 
has been well recognized as a neurodevelopmental 
disorder, which is characterized mainly by intellectual 
disability with inability to speak, limited walking 
ability, hypotonia, stereotypic movement, epilepsy, 
and minor brain malformation [101]. Therefore, this 
study expands the phenotypic spectrum linked to 
MEF2C mutation.
In conclusion, this is the first report on the 
association of MEF2C loss-of-function mutation with 
increased vulnerability to CHD in humans, which 
provides novel insight into the molecular mechanism 
of CHD, suggesting potential implications for an 
improved strategy in early diagnosis and 
individualized treatment of CHD.
