ABSTRACT: Reduction of an enzyme activity required for the
lysosomal degradation of glycosaminoglycan (gag) chains will result
in a mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) disorder. Substrate deprivation
therapy (SDT), a potential therapy option for MPS with residual
enzyme activity, aims to reduce the synthesis of gag chains, the
natural substrate for the deficient enzyme. Reduced substrate levels
would balance the reduced level of enzyme in patient cells, resulting
in normalized gag turnover. Rhodamine B, a nonspecific inhibitor,
reduced gag synthesis in a range of normal and MPS cells and also
decreased lysosomal storage of gag in MPS VI (72%) and MPS IIIA
(60%) cells. Body weight gain of male MPS IIIA mice treated with
1 mg/kg rhodamine B was reduced compared with untreated MPS
IIIA mice and was indistinguishable from that of normal mice. Liver
size, total gag content, and lysosomal gag was reduced in treated
MPS IIIA animals as was urinary gag excretion. Lysosomal gag
content in the brain was also reduced by treatment. The alteration in
MPS IIIA clinical pathology by rhodamine B, combined with the
observation that treatment had no effect on the health of normal
animals, demonstrates the potential for SDT in general as a therapy
for MPS disorders. (Pediatr Res 60: 309–314, 2006)
The MPSs are a group of 11 related lysosomal storage
disorders that arise from the deficiency of an enzyme
activity involved in the intracellular turnover of gag chains
(1). The enzyme deficiency results in the accumulation of
undegraded gag in a range of cells and leads to pathology that
varies according to the MPS type but includes central nervous
system (CNS) deterioration, skeletal abnormalities, corneal
clouding, and organomegaly (1).
The progressive nature of pathology in MPS presents a
continual challenge to the clinical management of patients.
Until recently, there has been no multitissue therapy for MPS,
with symptoms treated as and when they arise. Bone marrow
transplantation (BMT) improves the progression of MPS I and
VI (2,3) but has shown variable outcomes for other MPS.
Significant morbidity and mortality remain associated with
BMT. With the advent of recombinant protein technologies,
enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) has been trialed and ini￾tiated for several MPSs (4 – 6). ERT resolves most of the
pathology associated with MPS but brain, cartilage, and cor￾nea remain refractory to treatment. In particular, the blood￾brain barrier prevents replacement enzyme from reaching the
brain and ERT in its present form is unsuitable for MPS with
CNS pathology, i.e. the majority of MPS I, MPS II, and MPS
III patients. Direct injection of enzyme into specific sites such
as the cisterna magna or the joint space is currently under
investigation as a means of targeting brain and cartilage (7,8).
Substrate deprivation therapy (SDT) is an alternative or
adjunct therapy option for MPS. The general premise behind
SDT is to slow down or prevent the initial accumulation of
substrate for the deficient enzyme by inhibiting its synthesis
(9). Patients with residual enzyme activity will therefore be
able to more effectively turn over substrate. For MPSs, this
means reducing the synthesis of one or more of the five
different gag chains that accumulate in these disorders (1).
Conceptually, gag synthesis inhibitors can affect different
points in the gag biosynthetic pathway (10). The nonspecific
inhibitor rhodamine B (11) is thought to inhibit chain elonga￾tion. The more specific inhibitors of individual gag synthesis,
such as 4-deoxy-4-fluoro-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-glucose and
4-deoxy-4-fluoro-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-galactose, which in￾hibit heparan sulfate (HS) gag synthesis, also affect chain
elongation (12). Alternatively, inhibitors that prevent the ad￾dition of sulfate moieties are applicable to MPSs II, IIIA, IIID,
IVA, and VI (13). The isoflavone genistein, which inhibits
tyrosine kinase, is thought to decrease gag synthesis (14) or
the expression of the parent proteoglycan molecule depending
on cell type (15). No in vivo studies have been reported for any
inhibitor of gag synthesis in MPS disorders.
SDT has been evaluated in two mouse models of non-MPS
lysosomal storage disorders: the glycolipid storage disorders
Tay-Sachs disease and Sandhoff disease (16,17). Treatment
with an inhibitor of glycolipid synthesis, N-butyldeoxynorjiri￾mycin (NB-DNJ), prevented the lysosomal accumulation of
substrate, slowed the onset of somatic and CNS symptoms,
and increased the life expectancy of treated animals. NB-DNJ

is also under clinical evaluation for the treatment of nonneu￾ropathic (type I) Gaucher disease (18). Phase I/II clinical trials
clearly revealed a reduction in liver and spleen volume and an
increase in hemoglobin and platelet count. Although less
effective than ERT, NB-DNJ was approved for treatment of
patients with type I Gaucher disease with mild to moderate
disease (9). The ease of administration (oral versus i.v. infu￾sion) and the reduced cost of NB-DNJ were considered sig￾nificant advantages over ERT (19,20). The promising results
support the evaluation of the SDT approach in other types of
lysosomal storage disorders.
In this study, we report the first SDT treatment for MPS
disorders targeting the gag substrate. Rhodamine B, a nonspe￾cific inhibitor of gag synthesis, reduced the lysosomal storage
of gag in MPS cells. An in vivo therapy trial set up in the MPS
IIIA mouse, which accumulates HS gag, demonstrated that
rhodamine B altered several clinical parameters of disease
progression toward normal. In particular, a reduction in body
weight gain in male MPS IIIA mice and a reduction in liver
size, total gag and lysosomal gag content, and urinary gag
excretion was observed.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell isolation. Brain cells were isolated from newborn mice by trypsin
digestion (21). The cells were determined to be a mixture of neuronal and glial
cells by staining with cell-specific antibodies Neu200 (Sigma Chemical Co.)
and GFAP (DAKO), respectively. Normal skin fibroblasts and MPS patient
fibroblasts were purchased from the Coriell Cell Repository (Camden, NJ) or
obtained from the Department of Genetic Medicine, Children, Youth, and
Women’s Health Service, after obtaining informed consent. Be(2)-C cells
were obtained from ATCC. Skin fibroblasts and primary brain cells were
maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10%
fetal calf serum (FCS), 50 U/mL penicillin G, and 50 g/mL streptomycin
sulfate. Be(2)-C cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented
as above.
Glycosaminoglycan and protein synthesis. Cells were grown to conflu￾ency in six-well plates. For determination of dose response, cells were
preincubated with 0 to 100 g/mL rhodamine B for 1 h at 37°C. Cells were
then incubated in the same concentration of rhodamine B plus 5 Ci/mL 35S[SO4] for 6 h at 37°C. The medium was removed, and cells extracted into
4 mol/L guanidine HCl, 50 mmol/L sodium acetate pH 5.8 buffer containing
0.1 mol/L amino hexanoic acid, 0.05 mol/L Na2 ethylenediamine tetraacetic
acid (EDTA), and 0.1% Triton X-100. Unincorporated isotope was removed
by size exclusion chromatography on Sephadex G-25 equilibrated in the
above buffer. To determine the rate of gag synthesis, cells were preincubated
in medium containing 50 g/mL rhodamine B for 1 h at 37°C, then incubated
in the same concentration of rhodamine B plus 5 Ci/mL 35S[SO4] for up to
24 h at 37°C. The medium and cell layer were treated as above. To measure
protein synthesis, cells were preincubated in various concentrations of rho￾damine B as above for 1 h at 37°C. Cells were then incubated in the same
concentration of rhodamine B plus 5 Ci/mL 3
H-serine for 6 h at 37°C.
Medium was removed and the cell layer scraped into 20 mmol/L Tris,
0.5 mol/L NaCl, pH 7.0. Radiolabeled proteins were precipitated with 5%
trichloroacetic acid containing 20 mmol/L L-serine. The precipitated protein
was resuspended in 0.5 mol/L NaOH and radioactivity measured. Synthesis of
gag and protein was normalized to cell protein (22).
In vivo administration of rhodamine B. The MPS IIIA phenotype is
maintained on a mixed genetic background of predominantly 129SvJ and
CD1 with C57Bl/6 and SJL contributions (23). MPS IIIA mice were identified
by mutation analysis in the week after birth (24). MPS IIIA (n  5) and
normal (n  5) mice were injected weekly from 4 wk of age with 1 mg/kg
rhodamine B (in sterile saline) via the tail vein. Body weights were measured
weekly and urine was collected every 2 wk. Mice were killed at 3, 5, and 7
mo of age (after 2, 4, and 6 mo of treatment). Age-matched untreated MPS
IIIA (n  5) and untreated normal (n  5) mice were used as controls. Studies
were approved by the Children, Youth, and Women’s Health Service Insti￾tutional Animal Ethics Committee.
Isolation of urinary gag. Urinary gags were precipitated with two volumes
of 0.1% cetylpyrinium chloride at 37°C for 30 min followed by centrifugation
at 1500  g for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended in 150 L 2 mol/L LiCl
and 0.8 mL absolute ethanol added to precipitate gags at 20°C for 1 h. The
precipitate was recovered by centrifugation at 1500  g for 10 min, and the
pellet resuspended in water. Gag content (25) was normalized to urinary
creatinine, measured on a Beckman Synchron CX5 CE autoanalyzer (Syn￾chron CX Systems).
Total tissue gag content. Brain and liver samples were homogenized in
five volumes of 6 mol/L urea, 0.05 mol/L Na acetate pH 5.0, 0.1% Triton
X-100 containing protease inhibitors (0.1 mol/L aminocaproic acid, 0.1 mol/L
Na2EDTA, 5 mmol/L benzamidine, 0.5 mmol/L phenyl methyl sulfonyl
fluoride, and 10 mmol/L n-ethylmaleimide) at 4°C for 48 h. The tissue
homogenate was centrifuged at 7700  g for 25 min at 4°C and the
supernatant applied to DEAE-Sephacel resin equilibrated in 0.1 mol/L Na
acetate buffer, pH 5.0. Columns were washed in 10-column volumes of the
same buffer and gags eluted in 5-column volumes of the same buffer con￾taining 2 mol/L NaCl. Gag was determined as uronic acid (25) and normalized
to tissue weight.
Isolation of lysosomal gags from tissues or cells. Liver or brain tissue was
homogenized in five volumes of 0.25 mol/L sucrose; 1 mmol/L EDTA, pH
7.5; and then loaded on an 18% Percoll gradient and centrifuged at 32,000 
g for 60 min at 4°C (26). Aliquots (1.0 mL) were taken and assayed for
-hexosaminidase activity (27) to identify the lysosomal fractions. These
were pooled and gags purified by DEAE-Sephacel chromatography as above.
MPS II, IIIA, VI patient and control skin fibroblasts were grown to confluency
 25 g/mL rhodamine B for 14 d. On day 14, 3 Ci/mL 35S[SO4] was added
to each flask and incubated overnight at 37°C. Cells were harvested using
0.012% trypsin, 0.002% EDTA, homogenized and loaded onto a 30% Percoll
gradient (26), and centrifuged for 60 min at 32,000  g at 4°C. Each gradient
was fractionated into 1.0-mL aliquots and processed as above.
Statistical analysis. The relationship between mouse body weight, time,
genotype, and treatment was analyzed using restricted or residual maximum
likelihood (REML) (28). Tissue weight or gag content versus treatment group
was assessed using a one-way analysis of variance with Tukey’s honestly
significant difference (SPSS, version 11.0).
RESULTS
Inhibition of gag synthesis by rhodamine B in normal and
MPS cells. The addition of increasing concentrations of rho￾damine B to the culture medium of MPS IIIA skin fibroblasts
or Be(2)-C neuroblastoma cells resulted in a dose-dependent
decrease in 35S[SO4] incorporation into gags (Fig. 1a and b).
Protein synthesis was unaffected by the addition of rhodamine
B up to 75 g/mL (p  0.038, Fig. 1a). The addition of 50
g/mL rhodamine B to cell culture medium resulted in a
decrease in gag synthesis in human MPS VI and MPS IIIA
skin fibroblasts, normal and MPS IIIA mouse brain cells, and
the Be(2)C neuroblastoma cell line (Table 1 and Fig. 1c). The
inhibition of gag synthesis by rhodamine B led to a reduction
of 60% and 72.5% in stored gag in the lysosomes of MPS IIIA
and MPS VI skin fibroblasts, respectively (Fig. 2).
In vivo treatment with rhodamine B in the MPS IIIA
mouse. Both normal and MPS IIIA animals received rhoda￾mine B weekly over a 6-mo treatment period from 4 wk of
age. No difference was observed between normal treated and
untreated mice with respect to overall physical condition and
growth. No difference in body weight gain was observed in
either male or female normal mice with treatment (REML,
p  0.5, data not shown).
Treated MPS IIIA animals lost the scruffy appearance and
hunched posture characteristic of the untreated MPS IIIA mice
(Fig. 3). All untreated MPS IIIA mice gained weight more
rapidly than normal mice such that by 16-wk MPS IIIA males
were 129% of normal and MPS IIIA females were 117% of
normal body weight (Fig. 4a and b). A decrease in body
310 ROBERTS ET AL.

weight gain was observed in treated male MPS IIIA animals
compared with untreated littermates that became evident after
100 d of age (Fig. 4a), such that at 16 wk of age, treated MPS
IIIA animal body weight was 81% of the untreated MPS IIIA
bodyweight and 105% of normal weight. A reduction in body
weight gain by female MPS IIIA mice was also observed on
treatment with rhodamine B (to 87% of the untreated body
weight at 16 wk, Fig. 4b); however, the difference was not
significant.
Total urinary gag levels in untreated MPS IIIA mice varied
between individual animals but in general was elevated com￾pared with normal (Fig. 5). Treatment of MPS IIIA mice with
1 mg/kg rhodamine B reduced the urinary excretion of gag
toward normal. This was particularly evident at earlier times
(117 d). Treatment of normal animals with 1 mg/kg rhoda￾mine B had no effect on urinary gag levels (data not shown).
Liver and spleen weight increased with age in MPS IIIA
animals (Fig. 6a and data not shown). Treatment with rhoda￾mine B reduced liver weight in MPS IIIA mice but did not
affect spleen weight. No alteration in liver or spleen size was
observed in the normal animals on treatment (p  0.05, data
not shown). All other MPS IIIA organ weights fell within the
normal range. Total liver gag content was reduced toward
normal in MPS IIIA mice treated with rhodamine B (Fig. 6b).
No difference was noted in total gag content between un￾treated and treated liver. The total tissue gag level in other
organs was very low, and no change with treatment was
observed. After 6 mo of treatment (i.e., at 7 mo of age),

lysosomal gag content in MPS IIIA liver was also reduced
toward normal (Fig. 6c). Lysosomal gag content in the brain
(the only other tissue examined) also decreased with rhoda￾mine B treatment (Fig. 6c).
DISCUSSION
MPS pathology arises from an imbalance between the
synthesis and degradation of gag chains. Traditional ap￾proaches to correct this imbalance rely on replacing the defi￾cient enzyme to remove accumulated substrate. More recently,
novel approaches seek to reduce the synthesis of substrate and
thus prevent or minimize its initial accumulation (9). Both
methods will result in an overall reduction in the lysosomal
burden of gag. Pathology in MPS has been shown to correlate
to the level of gag storage (29); thus, any treatment that
reduces lysosomal storage is likely to have a positive patient
outcome.
In this study, we have shown that rhodamine B reduces gag
synthesis in a range of normal and MPS cells including those
that display pathology in vivo. In MPS cells, this decrease in
gag synthesis led to a reduction in the level of gag within the
lysosome. The accumulation of both HS (MPS IIIA fibro￾blasts) and dermatan sulfate (MPS VI fibroblasts) was reduced
by rhodamine B treatment, confirming the general nature of
this gag synthesis inhibitor. In MPS patients with detectable
residual enzyme activity, the decreased delivery of gag to the
lysosome is expected to more closely match remaining en￾zyme levels and improve the gag turnover rate.
The MPS IIIA mouse is a naturally occurring model of
human MPS IIIA with similar biochemical and clinical fea￾tures (23,24). In vivo, both normal and MPS IIIA mice toler￾ated the 6-mo treatment regimen with no obvious side effects.
No difference was noted in body weight, organ weight, organ
gag content, or urinary gag excretion in treated normal mice.
This may reflect either the very low level of gag naturally
found in normal tissues, which falls at the lower limit of
detection of the assay system used or a very rigorous control
of gag metabolism. In contrast, treated MPS IIIA mice exhibit
a distinct reduction in urinary gag excretion, liver size, total
liver gag, lysosomal gag content in liver and brain, and body
weight gain compared with untreated MPS IIIA animals.
Compared with normal mice, MPS IIIA mice gain weight
faster and have a higher mature body weight (Fig. 4). The
increase in abdominal organ weight in affected animals can
account for some but not all of the additional bodyweight.
HS proteoglycans (HSpgs) are postulated to have a direct
effect on adipose tissue by stimulating the uptake of lipid
sources such as very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) (30) by
either (i) binding and directly internalizing apolipoprotein
E– enriched VLDL (31) or (ii) liberating fatty acids for uptake
by other transport proteins through the binding of lipoprotein
lipase (32). However, no gross change in body fat was noted
postmortem in any of the untreated MPS IIIA mice compared
with normal or treated MPS IIIA mice (unpublished observa￾tion), indicating the excess of HS in MPS IIIA had no direct
effect on lipid accumulation and fat deposition. HSpgs have
also been implicated in the control of feeding behavior (33).
Overexpression of syndecan-1 results in abnormal expression
of this HSpg in the hypothalamic nuclei that control energy

balance and transgenic syndecan-1 mice develop maturity￾onset obesity. In contrast, mice engineered to overexpress
heparanase, one of the enzymes required for HS digestion,
displayed reduced food consumption and decreased body
weight (34,35). Thus, HS levels in the hypothalamus are
intimately involved in the signals that regulate feeding behav￾ior and maintain energy balance and the observation that
rhodamine B treatment reduced weight gain in MPS IIIA mice
may be an indication that this molecule can affect this control
mechanism.
Rhodamine B treatment decreased lysosomal gag content in
both the liver and brain of MPS IIIA mice. The latter obser￾vation is encouraging and suggests that rhodamine B may
have entered the brain. Additional studies are underway to test
this directly by measuring neurologic function to assess
whether the positive effect of rhodamine B on somatic pathol￾ogy extends to the CNS. Rhodamine B has a molecular weight
of 479 Da and forms a limited number of hydrogen bonds with
water; therefore, it possesses the necessary properties for
passage across the blood-brain barrier (36).
SDT has the potential to be used in MPS conditions as a
stand-alone therapy such as currently used in nonneurono￾pathic forms of Gaucher disease (18). However, its potential
may be more fully realized when considered as an adjunct to
other forms of therapy. The efficacy of SDT combined with
BMT has been demonstrated in Sandhoff mice (37). Mice on
combined therapy survived significantly longer than those on
either treatment alone, indicating the potential for combined
therapies in patients with a low level of residual enzyme
activity. Similarly, combined SDT and ERT can have a num￾ber of advantages. Administration of enzyme will have an
immediate effect to reduce systemic storage, and continuation
of patients on SDT could prevent or slow down reaccumula￾tion of storage. This could have a number of flow-on effects
including reducing the dose of enzyme required, frequency of
enzyme administration, and altering the mode of administra￾tion. Together, these could be expected to lower the financial
burden of treatment and increase patient compliance (38). In
addition, SDT can be expected to impinge on “difficult to
treat” tissues. By nature of their small size, chemical inhibitors
can be expected to distribute throughout the body reaching
tissues and cells not accessible to large recombinant lysosomal
enzymes.
This study demonstrates “proof of concept” that reducing
the level of gag synthesis has a positive effect on delaying
pathology in an animal model of MPS. To fully understand the
potential of SDT as a human therapy capable of addressing all
sites of MPS pathology, long-term studies of SDT must be
undertaken, preferably in large animal models. Numerous
animal models are available encompassing the range of pa￾thology, CNS, skeletal, and otherwise, observed in human
MPS (39). The long-term (6 mo) chronic effect of depress￾ing gag synthesis is unknown but, if present, should become
apparent in large animal studies. The choice of SDT agent
must also be considered when designing human therapy op￾tions. Of the available gag synthesis inhibitors, only rhoda￾mine B has been tested for toxic effects in vivo. Acute
exposure to rhodamine B, at a larger dose than used here,
results in mucous membrane and skin irritation in humans
(40), whereas the effect of long-term exposure is unknown.
Although it may be feasible to use rhodamine B as a SDT
agent in vivo, other inhibitors such as the 4-fluoro analogues of
naturally occurring sugars described by Berkin et al. (12) may
be more practical.
