Abstract
Background: Serum phosphate is a known risk factor for cardiovascular events and mortality in people with chronic kidney
disease (CKD), however data on the association of these outcomes with serum phosphate in the general population are
scarce. We investigate this relationship in people with and without CKD in a large community-based population.
Methods: Three groups from an adult cohort of the Quality Improvement in Chronic Kidney Disease (QICKD) cluster
randomised trial (ISRCTN56023731) were followed over a period of 2.5 years: people with normal renal function (N = 24,184),
people with CKD stages 1–2 (N = 20,356), and people with CKD stages 3–5 (N = 13,292). We used a multilevel logistic
regression model to determine the association between serum phosphate, in these groups, and a composite outcome of all￾cause mortality, cardiovascular events, and advanced coronary artery disease. We adjusted for known cardiovascular risk
factors.
Findings: Higher phosphate levels were found to correlate with increased cardiovascular risk. In people with normal renal
function and CKD stages 1–2, Phosphate levels between 1.25 and 1.50 mmol/l were associated with increased
cardiovascular events; odds ratio (OR) 1.36 (95% CI 1.06–1.74; p = 0.016) in people with normal renal function and OR 1.40
(95% CI 1.09–1.81; p = 0.010) in people with CKD stages 1–2. Hypophosphatemia (,0.75 mmol/l) was associated with fewer
cardiovascular events in people with normal renal function; OR 0.59 (95% CI 0.36–0.97; p = 0.049). In people with CKD stages
3–5, hyperphosphatemia (.1.50 mmol/l) was associated with increased cardiovascular risk; OR 2.34 (95% CI 1.64–3.32;
p,0.001). Other phosphate ranges were not found to have a significant impact on cardiovascular events in people with
CKD stages 3–5.
Conclusions: Serum phosphate is associated with cardiovascular events in people with and without CKD. Further research is
required to determine the mechanisms underlying these associations.

Introduction
Observational data suggest that an elevated serum phosphate
increases the risk of cardiovascular events and mortality in patients
with chronic kidney disease (CKD) [1–4]. Furthermore, hypo￾phosphatemia is associated with reduced cardiovascular events in
people with CKD [1,3]. Hyperphosphataemia is also associated
with increased vascular and valvular calcification in end-stage
renal disease [5,6]. Secondary hyperparathyroidism is common in
people with CKD and subsequently altered calcium and vitamin D
metabolism may be responsible for this increased arterial
calcification [7]. However, repeated investigation has not been
able to identify a relationship between serum calcium and
cardiovascular events, and there is inconclusive evidence for an
association with parathyroid hormone levels [3].
Given the diverse biochemical roles of phosphate, it is possible
that high serum phosphate is more directly responsible for
cardiovascular events than previously suggested. Indeed, elevated
phosphate also correlates with increased vascular and valvular
calcification in people with normal renal function [8,9] and an
association with cardiovascular events has also been reported in
people with pre-existing coronary artery disease [10] and in the
general population [11–13].
A number of potential mechanisms by which phosphate leads to
increased cardiovascular risk have been proposed [14]. Elevated
phosphate levels induce degradation of the extracellular matrix
and causes osteochondrogenic change in vascular smooth muscle

cells [15]. These changes cause increased deposition of extracel￾lular calcium phosphate crystals, cell apoptosis, and ultimately
vascular calcification [15,16]. Vessel calcification is associated with
left ventricular hypertrophy, decreased coronary blood flow, and
cardiovascular events although causality has not been determined
[17,18]. Hyperphosphatemia may also cause endothelial damage
through increased production of reactive oxygen species [19,20].
This process is potentially preventable as dietary phosphate
restriction in murine models of secondary hyperparathyroidism
prevents endothelial damage [21,22]. Population studies demon￾strate that increased dietary phosphate intake is correlated with
increased serum phosphate; particularly phosphate additives in
processed foods [23,24].
The major focus of observational studies has so far been on
patients with CKD, however a number of studies have analysed
the correlation with phosphate and cardiovascular events and
mortality in the general population. In order to confirm or refute
previous findings, we investigate the impact of phosphate in the
general population with a large community based cohort, using
routinely collected data. We also compare these results with the
relationship between phosphate and cardiovascular events in
people with CKD. As parathyroid hormone (PTH) is involved in
phosphate homeostasis we also investigate the relationship
between serum PTH and cardiovascular events.
Methods
The data analysed were from the Quality Improvement in
Chronic Kidney Disease (QICKD) cluster randomised trial
(clinical trials registration: ISRCTN56023731) [25]. These data
consist of the primary care records of the population of 127
primary care practices across England; a nationally representative
sample of urban, sub-urban and rural practices in London, Surrey,
Sussex, Leicester, Birmingham and Cambridge. The complete
protocol used for sampling and data collection from these practices
for the QICKD trial have been previously described [26]. A sub￾population of individuals in whom phosphate and renal indices
were available was selected for inclusion in this study. Routine
data from electronic records were collected over a five year period;
between January 2006 and December 2010. Data recorded
between January 2006 and June 2008 was used to determine the
baseline characteristics of the people included in the study, with
the most recent values of creatinine, phosphate and PTH used for
comparison. A second data collection was undertaken at 30
months to obtain follow-up data on outcomes.
The study population was subdivided by renal function into
three groups; people with normal renal function, people with
CKD stage 1–2, and people with CKD stage 3–5. CKD stage was
identified using estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)
measurements calculated using the modified diet in renal disease
equation from serum creatinine measurements [27,28] and
measurements of proteinuria. Normal renal function was defined
as an eGFR $90 ml/min and absence of significant proteinuria.
CKD stage 1–2 was defined as an eGFR of 60–89 ml/min or the
presence of significant proteinuria with an eGFR $90 ml/min.
CKD stages 3–5 were defined as an eGFR,60 ml/min.
Proteinuria was analysed using the diagnostic criteria described
by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence with
lower significance thresholds in people with diabetes (NICE) [28].
People without creatinine measurements were excluded from the
analysis. People were only included in the normal renal function
group if no proteinuria was present; those with no proteinuria
measurements were excluded from this group.
Outcomes
We used a combined outcome measure of all-cause mortality
and incident stroke, transient ischaemic attack (TIA), myocardial
infarction (MI), advanced coronary artery disease, new cardiac
failure and death, during the follow up period. Advanced coronary
artery disease was defined as at least one of; coronary artery
revascularisation procedures, progressive angina, angina at rest,
and acute coronary syndrome not otherwise diagnosed as MI.
Predictors
Traditional cardiovascular risk factors were identified from
analysis of the electronic patient records at baseline. These were
the Framingham risk factors; age, ethnicity, smoking status,
alcohol use, and body mass index (BMI), diabetes, hypertension,
low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high density lipoprotein
(HDL) cholesterol, and total cholesterol (TC).
BMI was calculated from routinely gathered measurements of
weight and height performed by physicians and practice nurses.
The presence of diabetes was defined from clinical coding records
and serum glucose values using a method we have validated
previously [29]. The presence of significant hypertension was
defined by prescription of antihypertensive medications (angio￾tensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor
blockers) using electronic prescription records kept by every
practice included in the study.
Serum phosphate levels were analysed as a categorical variable
grouped in 0.25 mmol/l bands (,0.75, 0.75–1.00, 1.01–1.25,
1.26–1.50, and .1.50 mmol/l). Serum PTH was categorised as
high (.60 ng/l), normal (10–60 ng/l), low (,10 ng/l) or not
measured.
The presence of proteinuria was determined by examining a
hierarchy of clinical tests; albumin creatinine ratio (ACR), then if
not available; protien creatinine ratio (PCR), 24 hour urinary
protein, or urine dipstick testing in turn. Threshold values are
shown in Table 1. The lower significance thresholds for people
with diabetes are also shown [28].
Laboratory sample data (cholesterol, glucose, phosphate,
creatinine, and proteinuria measurements) were taken from
samples collected routinely in primary care practices during
practice opening times (usually 8am to 6pm) and processed in local
laboratories. Electronic primary care records are automatically
updated with these results. Where multiple values of each
parameter were recorded during the baseline period the most
recent value was used.
Statistical analysis
Numerical data was refined, to adjust for inputting errors, by
removing values outside of physiological limits. Where the variable
of interest had not been measured or recorded in the patient
record individuals were categorised as being not monitored for
that given parameter and included separately for analysis.
Multilevel binary logistic regression models were built to
account for outcome variation between primary care practices.
Patients were nested within practices using a random intercept.
Model selection was performed using the approach described by
Maindonald and Braun [30] by minimising the Bayesian
information criterion (BIC) using backward stepwise elimination.
Models were validated using receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) curves and Hosmer-Lemeshow testing. People who left
their practice during the follow up period were excluded from the
logistic regression analysis. The analysis was performed using the
statistical package R and the multilevel R package lme4 [31].
Cox proportional hazards multivariate models were also con￾structed using the statistical package R to provide a time-event

analysis. Individuals who left their practice during the follow up
period were included as censored data. The date of each outcome
event was taken as the date it was recorded as occurring in the
primary care records. This data was available for all outcome
events.
Ethical considerations
No patient identifiable data was used in the analysis described
here. Other ethical considerations of the QICKD study are
described elsewhere [26,32].
Results
A total of 741,913 people were included in the analysis. We
excluded people who died or left the practice before the start of the
follow up period (n = 123), if they were aged less than 18 at the
start of the follow up period (n = 142,533), or those who left the
practice during the follow up period (n = 51,763). From the
remaining adults (N = 547,494) only people with phosphate
measurements and required renal indices measurements before
the start of the follow up period were included (N = 57,832). The
proportion of the complete population with measurements of each
variable is given in table 2. From these; 24,184 people were found
to have no evidence of renal impairment, 20,356 people CKD
stages 1–2, and 13,292 people CKD stages 3–5. The demograph￾ics of these groups are shown in table 2.
The mean age of the group with normal renal function was 52.8
years (standard deviation 17.0 years). 1,005 (4.2%) people suffered
one or more adverse cardiovascular event during the 30 month
follow up period. There were 133 strokes, 120 TIAs, 84 MIs, 110
coronary artery procedures, 45 other advanced coronary artery
disease events, 77 new cases of heart failure and 521 deaths.
The mean age of the population with CKD stage 1–2 was 56.0
years (standard deviation 16.1 years). 861 (4.2%) people with
CKD suffered one or more adverse cardiovascular event including
116 strokes, 114 TIAs, 79 MIs, 109 coronary artery procedures, 27
other advanced coronary artery disease events, 79 new cases of
heart failure and 415 deaths.
The mean age of the population with CKD stage 3–5 was 72.8
years (standard deviation 12.9 years). 1,600 (12.0%) people with
CKD suffered one or more adverse cardiovascular event including
175 strokes, 140 TIAs, 120 MIs, 113 coronary artery procedures,
50 other advanced coronary artery disease events, 143 new cases
of heart failure and 986 deaths. The total number of outcome
events by CKD stage is given in table 3).
Serum PTH levels, BMI and total cholesterol were not found to
be significantly associated with adverse outcomes and were
therefore removed from the regression models. No variables were
found to be co-linear with phosphate.
After adjusting for known confounders, both logistic regression
models (table 4) and Cox regression models (table 5) demonstrate
consistent correlations between phosphate and cardiovascular risk
in all three population groups: A monotonically increasing
relationship between phosphate and cardiovascular events was
found in people with normal renal function (figure 1). Lower
phosphate appears to be protective and higher phosphate increases
risk in this group. This trend also appears amongst people with
CKD stage 1–2, however reduced risk with lower phosphate levels
was not statistically significant. In people with CKD stages 3–5
hyperphosphatemia (which we have defined as phosphate
.1.5 mmol/l) was found to be associated with increased
cardiovascular risk. No protective effect of low phosphate (which
we have defined as ,0.75 mmol/l) is suggested in people with
CKD stages 3–5 (figure 1).
Discussion
Principal findings
In this large community-based population, serum phosphate
levels were associated with cardiovascular events and mortality in
both people with normal renal function and those with CKD. In
people with normal renal function the relationship appears to be
linear with no minimum threshold for improved cardiovascular
outcomes. In those with CKD stages 3–5, hyperphosphatemia was
associated with increased risk but lower levels of phosphate were
not associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular events. In those
with CKD stages 1–2 the relationship also appears to be a linear
increase in cardiovascular risk with increasing phosphate although
wide confidence intervals make this somewhat uncertain. This
general trend between increased cardiovascular risk and higher
serum phosphate remains when the population is analysed as a
whole, but no reduction in risk was found with hypophosphatemia.
Implications
These findings add to the growing weight of evidence that
phosphate is an independent predictor of cardiovascular disease, in
both people with and without CKD. Furthermore, these findings
call in to question the definition of a ‘normal range’ for phosphate,
as ‘low’ phosphate is associated with better outcomes in people
with normal renal function. If phosphate is demonstrated to be an
effective cardiovascular target, perception of serum levels should
be similar to that of serum cholesterol or blood pressure, where the
focus is on achieving values below a threshold. We propose that an
increased research focus on the relationship between serum
phosphate and cardiovascular events in the general population is
needed.
Comparison with the literature
We found the prevalence of CKD stages 3–5 to be 7.6% in the
adult population; this is in good agreement with the UK based
population estimate of 6%, which includes under 18 s [33].

Correlations with known cardiovascular risk factors were also
consistent with those derived from the Framingham studies [34].
Previous data suggests increased phosphate is associated with
increased mortality and cardiovascular risk in the general
population and that hypophosphatemia is associated with reduced
risk [10,11]. This study confirms these findings. It also is in
agreement with previous findings that hyperphosphatemia is
associated with increased cardiovascular risk in people with
CKD [1–3]. In people with CKD, phosphate below the normal
range has been associated with both improved [1,35] and
worsened [36] cardiovascular outcomes. We found no effect of
low phosphate on cardiovascular outcomes in the CKD popula￾tion. Low phosphate is a marker of malnutrition [37], which is
common in people with advanced renal disease [38]. This
correlation may mask any potential benefits of low phosphate in
this group and account for discrepancies between previous studies.
Limitations of the method
The limitations of this study include those of working with
routinely collected data (34). A particular consideration here is that
only a small proportion of the population had serum phosphate
measurements. There is a probable bias for increased co￾morbidities amongst this group, however, this is likely to be a
systematic effect and is therefore unlikely to explain the
relationship between phosphate and cardiovascular events ob￾served.
The number of people with phosphate levels at the extremes of
the range was small. There is therefore greater uncertainty in our
calculated odds of a cardiovascular event at these extremes.

Additionally, very few people had serum PTH measurements. It is
therefore not possible to conclude from these data that there is no
relationship between serum PTH and cardiovascular events.
Serum phosphate levels are subject to diurnal variation with a
minimum level in the morning with a subsequent rise throughout
the day [39,40]. As we did not have data on the times at which
individual serum samples were taken, we were unable to adjust for
this diurnal variation. It is likely that this will have weakened the
association with cardiovascular outcomes. Fixed time sampling
(e.g. 9am phosphate levels) may demonstrate improved correlation
with cardiovascular outcomes. However, our data suggests that a
random day-time phosphate measurement can be correlated with
cardiovascular outcome.
Further research
Whilst the mechanisms underlying this association remain to be
fully elucidated the possibility that phosphate represents a
potential therapeutic target should be considered. Trials looking
at the impact of phosphate binders and dietary phosphate
restriction have focused on end-stage renal disease and have
mostly been underpowered for detection of reduced cardiovascular
events [41–43], although sevelamer (a phosphate binder) has been
demonstrated to reduce all-cause mortality in CKD stages 3–4

stages 3–5 by serum phosphate category.

[44]. Research is needed into the causes of variation in phosphate
levels within the population as this could prove to be vital in
guiding potential intervention strategies. The role of phosphate
additives in processed foods is one potential consideration.
Conclusions
Serum phosphate is a predictor of cardiovascular events in
people with and without CKD: High phosphate levels are
associated with increased cardiovascular risk in both those with
normal renal function and CKD. Low phosphate levels are
associated with fewer cardiovascular events in people without
renal disease. Further research is required to determine the
mechanisms underlying these associations.
