CHRONIC PYELONEPHRITIS AND ARTERIAL HYPERTENSION
By ALLAN M. BUTLER
(From the Department of Pediatrics of the Harvard Medical School and the Infants' and
Children's Hospitals, Boston)
(Received for publication July 7, 1937)
T'he present paper presents certain clinical and
pathological evidence which demonstrates that hy￾pertension not infrequently is associated with
pyelonephritis before there is any appreciable dim￾inution in renal function and that hypertension
which is secondary to unilateral pyelonephritis
may disappear when the involved kidney is re￾moved.
Ritter and Baehr (1) described renal arteriolar
sclerosis in congenital polycystic disease of the
kidney and remarked upon a preliminary period
of arterial hypertension, cardiac hypertrophy and
hyposthenuria that usually precedes the terminal
uremia in that disease. Bell and Pedersen (2)
stated that " hypertension has never been reported
in pyelonephritis." Volhard (3) and Schwarz
(4) reported hypertension-in patients with con￾tracted kidneys (schrumpfnieren). Longcope
and Winkenwerder (5) reported elevated blood
pressures in the uremic phase of cases of chronic
pyelonephritis. Weiss, Parker and Robb (6)
observed that patients with malignant hyperten￾sion frequently had a history of chronic pyelone￾phritis, pyelitis, or perinephritic abscess. They
suggested that such a renal infection may heal but
that the hypertension in'itiated by it may continue
to progress. Fishberg (7) mentioned the hyper￾tension that may occur in children in the presence
of urinary obstruction and in polycystic disease
of the kidney when there is extensive destruction
of renal parenfchyma. He stated, however, that
hypertension does not occur in that disease if there
are extensive areas of intact parenchyma. Peters
(8), Peters, Lavietes and Zimmerman (9), and
Zimmerman and Peters (10) have called attention
to the frequency with which pyuria and eclampsia
are associated in pregnancy and suggested a re￾lation between urinary tract infection and hyper￾tension. Kimmelstiel and Wilson (11) studied
thirteen patients with acute diffuse pyelonephritis;
nine died in uremia, and hypertension was present
in four of these. Two patients presented what
was interpreted as essential hypertension with
superimposed diffuse acute pyelonephritis but
without renal insufficiency. Twenty-six patients
who suffered from diffuse chronic pyelonephritis
were also studied; of these, hypertension and
uremia were associated in sixteen; hypertension
alone was present in four, and uremia without
hypertension in six. Hypertension without
marked renal insufficiency, therefore, was present
in six of their patients. In the majority of in￾stances, they were unable to decide whether they
were dealing with a primary " vascular " hyper￾tension or with a secondary " renal " hypertension.
In spite of the frequency with which pyelone￾phritis is encountered in childhood (12), we have
found no report of a serious hypertension oc￾curring in the pyelonephritis of childhood before
renal insufficiency was present. Interestingly
enough, Amberg ( 13) in reporting twenty-five
cases of hypertension in children included five
patients with pyuria or bacilluria but made no par￾ticular comment upon the presence of pyelonephri￾tis in these patients.
The records concerning the blood pressures of
many of the patients admitted to this hospital with
chronic pyelonephritis are not complete enough to
supply accurate information concerning the re￾spective times at which the hypertension, if pres￾ent, and renal insufficiency first appeared, but such
data as are available seem significant. During the
past ten years fifteen children between three and
eleven years of age were shown at necropsy to
have pyelonephritis. Adequate records of the
blood pressures of seven of these patients are not
available. The records of the blood pressures for
the remaining eight patients show systolic pres￾sures ranging from 250 to 140 mm. Hg and dia￾stolic pressures from 170 to 110 mm. Hg, the
average systolic and diastolic pressures being re￾spectively, 190 and 140 mm. Hg. Two of these
patients (Cases 3 an'd 4 reported below) had hy￾pertensive crises and died of cardiac failure before

significant nitrogen retention occurred. The clini￾cal histories of two others of the group studied
pathologically indicated that the pyelonephritis
and hypertension preceded severe nitrogen reten￾tion. During the same ten year period three pa￾tients with pyelonephritis and hypertension died
and permission for autopsy was not obtained.
The histories of two of these patients (Cases 1
and 2 below) indicate that the pyelonephritis and
hypertension preceded significant* renal insuffi￾ciency and nitrogen retention. During this same
definite proof that the pyelonephritis preceded the
hypertension.
The fifth case reported here is that of a patient
who, coincident with a ureteral calculus, was
found to have a unilateral pyelonephritis and dur￾ing the course of the next 8 months developed
hypertension and cardiac failure. The removal of
the one infected kidney was followed by clearing
of the urine and a return of the blood pressure to
normal where it has remained for 20 months.
In this case there is strong evidence th-at the pye-

period nine patients with pyelonephritis and hy￾pertension were admitted to the hospital and when
last seen were living. Of these patients only one
had renal insufficiency, and in this one the pyelo￾nephritis and hypertension preceded the appear￾ance of the diminished renal function.
Thus we have fifteen patients (six dead and
nine living) who have had chronic pyelonephritis
and hypertension over a period of years before
there was appreciable diminution in kidney func￾tion. The detailed records of four of these pa￾tients are given below. In these cases there is no

way had a causal relation to it.
Subsequently, another patient, Case 6, who had
a unilateral pyelonephritis and hypertension which
was relieved by right nephrectomy, and whose
history suggested a relation between the renal
lesion and hypertension, was seen on the pediatric
ward of the Massachusetts General Hospital
through the kindness of Dr. Harold Higgins and
Dr. J. D. Barney.'

Barney. It is through his kindness that a brief descrip￾tion is given with the cases reported here.

PYELONEPHRITIS AND HYPERTENSION
DISCUSSION
It is of particular interest in relation to the last
two patients that A/foritz (14) reported three pa￾tients with essential hypertension in each of whom
the renal arteriolar sclerosis was found at ne￾cropsy to be limited to one kidney.
Both chronic pyelonephritis and nephrosclerosis
were revealed by postmortem examinations per￾formed on two of our patients (Cases 3 an'd 4).
The photomicrograph shown in Figure 1 illus￾trates the extensive character of the renal ar￾teriolar sclerosis in Case 4. From the clinical ex￾tients who suffered from both pyelonephritis and
hypertension.
A detailed review of the clinical observations
concerning the association of pyelonephritis and
hypertensioni in patients studied in this hospital,
however, led to the hypothesis that the hyperten￾sion might well be related to the local effect of the
pyelonephritis rather than to the renal insuffici￾ency encountered late in the disease. When this
hypothesis was put to an empirical test by the re￾moval of the infected kidney in a patient who
suffered from unilateral pyelonephritis and hyper￾m

amination of the retinal and peripheral vessels it
is proable that nephrosclerosis was present in ad￾dition to the pyelonephritis in Cases 1 and 2. It
is clear that no conclusion may be drawn from our
evidence in these four cases concerning' the rela￾tive time of onset of the pyelonephritis and the
nephrosclerosis or their relative importance in the
production of hypertension. The same difficulty
was encountered by Kimmelstiel and Wilsoh ( 11)
when they attempted to decide whether they were
dealing with primary " vascular " hypertension or
with secondary " renal " hypertension in their pa￾tension (Case 5) it was found to be effective.
The results in Dr. Barney's case (Case 6) lend
further support to such a relation between the
pyelonephritis and hypertension.
Pathological examination of the kidney re￾moved from our patient, Case 5, showed in ad￾dition' to severe pyelonephritis very early sclerosis
of the renal arterioles. These vascular lesions
were not sufficiently advanced or prominent to
merit the term of nephrosclerosis as it is ordi￾narily understood. The photomicropraph of Fig￾ure 2 illustrates the absence in Case 5 of such a

renal arteriolar sclerosis as observed in Case 4.
It is well known that chronic inflammatory proc￾esses of various kinds are accompanied by vas￾cular changes in the involved areas. In consider￾ing the r6le of ischemia and infections in the pro￾duction of hypertension, it is of interest that
Parker and Weiss (15) observed arteriolar sclero￾sis in the lung in the presence of pulmonary con￾gestion and infection. That obstruction to the
flow of urine from one kidney may result in a rise
in blood pressure has been shown by Bell and
Pedersen (2). Goldblatt, Lynch, Hanzal, and
Summerville (16), and Wood and Cash (17)
have produced hypertension in dogs by partially
obstructing the blood supply to one or both kid￾neys. Both possibilities may play a r6le in the
production of the hypertension secondary to py￾elonephritis.
The clinical significance of the observations re￾ported here is clear. At the present time we have
no explanation as to why some patients with
pyelonephritis develop hypertension before renal
insufficiency while some develop it only after the
renal damage has become marked, and still others
die in uremia with very little hypertension. This
question merits and will receive further clinical
and pathological study.
PROTOCOLS
Case 1: M. F. (Hospital Number 194,041), a girl of 9
years, came to the hosj4pal September 1935 because of re￾current frontal headache and vomiting and urinary fre￾quency. The family history was not contributory to the
patient's illness. The past history showed her to have
been a full term baby whose development was somewhat
delayed. She had mumps and pertussis at 5 years of age
and measles at 8 years. Ever since birth she had unusual
frequency and nocturia. At 5 years of age she began to
have severe headaches coming on every 2 to 3 months and
lasting all day. At 7 years of age, vomiting began to
accompany the headaches which became more frequent.
During the past year she failed to gain and was fatigued
very easily. Recently the headaches and vomiting oc￾curred weekly. Four months before admission, she was
found to have pus in her urine and was placed on a keto￾genic diet without effect on the pyuria.
A physical examination revealed a thin, chronically ill,
mentally alert girl. Both of the fundi showed albu￾minuric retinitis; there was edema of the optic discs, and
the retinal arteries were narrowed, tortuous, and gave a
light reflex. The heart was enlarged, a roentgenogram
showing a cardiac diameter of 9.8 cm. and an internal
diameter of the chest of 18.5 cm. The aortic arch was
broad. There was a blowing systolic murmur and
marked accentuation of the aortic second sound. The
peripheral arteries were thickened but not beaded. The
systolic blood pressure was 280 and the diastolic 170 mm.
Hg. The right kidney was palpable. The red blood cell
count was 3,700,000 per cu. mm. The hemoglobin was 72
per cent. The serum calcium was 9.6 mgm. per cent and
the serum inorganic phosphorus 3.3 mgm. per cent. The
blood urea nitrogen was 35 mgm. per cent and the serum
protein 6.3 grams per cent. An intramuscular phenol￾sulphonephthalein test showed 27 per cent excretion in
300 cc. of urine in 3 hours. The urea clearance was 17
per cent of normal. The urine showed from a very slight
trace to a large trace of albumin and numerous white
blood cells per high power field.
Two weeks after admission she had a hypertensive
crisis, the blood pressure rising to a systolic of 250 and
a diastolic of 210 mm. Hg. She became comatose, de￾lirious, and had several convulsions. The urine became
grossly bloody. A week later she appeared as she did at
admission. Six weeks after admission the blood pressure
rose to 260 mm. Hg systolic and 230 mm. Hg diastolic,
and she had a generalized convulsion. Twelve days later
a right splanchnic nerve resection ,pas done, and after
another 3 days the left splanchnicd'nerve was resected.
Following the second operation she was very anemic and
was given four transfusions. The anemia continued.
Eight days later she became oliguric and developed a
parotitis and pericardial friction n* and after two more
days died in uremia with a blood nonprotein nitrogen of
187 mgm. per cent. Permission for an autopsy was not
obtained.
Case 2: B. M. (Hospital Number 110,250), a girl of 8
years, entered the hospital in November 1931 because of
recurrent attacks of headache, fever and vomiting
throughout the previous 18 months. Frequent examina￾tion of the urine by the family doctor during this period
had shown that it always contained pus.
The past history showed she had been a normal baby
and had developed normally. She had had measles, per￾tussis, and chickenpox. Following tonsillitis at 3 years
of age she had had a tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy.
Immediately before the present illness she had had
mumps.
The physical examination showed a well developed but
small, undernourished, pale girl who appeared chronically
ill. The significant positive findings follow. The retinal
arteries showed increased light reflex, narrowing of the
lumen and tortuosity. The disks were blurred and hyper￾emic. The heart sounds were loud and forceful. There
was a soft systolic murmur with a marked accentu￾ation of the aortic and pulmonic second sounds. Radial
and brachial arteries were thickened. The systolic blood
pressure was 210 mm. Hg and the diastolic 170 mm. Hg.
On repeated examination the urine contained a very slight
trace of albumin and 5 to 30 white blood cells per high
power field in uncentrifuged specimens. On culture of
the urine there was a growth of B. coli. The blood non￾protein nitrogen was 24 mgm. per cent. An intramuscu￾lar phenolsulphonephthalein test showed 50 per cent ex￾892

cretion in two hours. A urea clearance was 65 per cent
of normal. A urine concentration test showed an inabil￾ity to concentrate above 1.012.2
Two weeks after entry the headaches became more
severe. The following day the patient had a hypertensive
cerebral crisis. The blood pressure at this time was 240
mm. Hg systolic and 170 mm. Hg diastolic. The patient
recovered from this cerebral accident, and the blood
pressure in the course of the next week fell to 180 mm.
Hg systolic and 150 mm. Hg diastolic. Before an ex￾amination of the urinary tract could be made the parents
removed the child against our advice.
Case 3: R. E. (Hospital Number 107,386), a boy 7
years of age, entered the hospital in January 1933 with
the chief complaint of severe headaches for several years
and vomiting and convulsions during the past 9 months.
He was a full term baby born following a normal labor.
His early development was normal, except that he grew
slowly, weighing 21 pounds at 2 years of age, 24 pounds
at 3 years of age, and 32 pounds at 5 years of age. At
2 years of age he was found to have a marked phimosis
which had caused pain on urination for the past 4 months.
At this time there was some tenderness to pressure over
the bladder, and the urine was found to contain a trace of
albumin, but no white blood cells. A circumcision re￾lieved the painful urination. He had pertussis at 2 years
of age, had broken a wrist in a fall at 5 years of age,
and one month before admission had received a blow
over the left eye which had caused a hemorrhage into the
eye which had been treated at the Boston City Hospital.
He had had frequency and nocturia for several years.
During the past 5 months the vomiting was frequently
projectile. Two months before admission it was known
that his systolic blood pressure was 220 mm. Hg.
Physical examination revealed a somewhat underdevel￾oped and undernourished boy weighing 37 pounds, who
was mentally alert and in no apparent distress. The sig￾nificant positive findings were as follows. Both retinas
showed multiple scarring from old hemorrhages. The
retinal arteries were narrow and the veins unusually tor￾tuous. The disk margins were indistinct, and there was
slight papilledema. The radial and brachial arteries were
thickened. The heart was slightly enlarged to the left.
The aortic second sound was greatly accentuated. The
systolic blood pressure was 240 mm. Hg and the diastolic
blood pressure, 190 mm. Hg. The liver was 3 cm. below
the costal margin. The spleen was palpable. Repeated
examination of the urine showed a slight trace of albumin
but no sediment. The blood nonprotein nitrogen was 30
mgm. per cent. Serum calcium and phosphorus were
normal. An intramuscular phenolsulphonephthalein test
showed 32 per cent excretion in 2 hours. The urea clear￾ance was 100 per cent of normal. A concentration test
showed the specific gravity to be limited to 1.012.2
Roentgenograms of the skull showed definite separation
of the coronal and sagittal sutures indicating increased

with hypertension.
intracranial pressure. Ventriculograms showed no lo￾calized distortion or filling defect. The very slight dila￾tation of the ventricles was consistent with a cerebral
edema. The long bones were negative for lead. The red
blood cells showed no stippling. The diagnosis of malig￾nant hypertension of unknown etiology was made. The
child was discharged to a convalescent home on February
28th with the same hypertension with which he entered.
He died of cardiac failure August 9, 1933, without re￾entering the hospital. An autopsy performed outside the
hospital 8 showed the following: cardiac hypertrophy and
dilatation, sclerosis of aorta, coronary and cerebral ves￾sels, bilateral pyelonephritis and hydronephrosis, arteri￾olar nephrosclerosis, bilateral hydro-ureters, cystitis and
dilatation of the bladder.
Case 4: R. W. (Hospital Number 143,483), an 11
year old boy, was admitted to the hospital October 14,
1930, because of severe recurrent attacks of frontal head￾ache, nausea, and vomiting beginning abruptly 11 months
ago. The attacks occurred about once a week and were
frequently precipitated by emotional disturbances. In
addition to these symptoms there had been severe upper
abdominal pain and dizziness over the past month. The
family history was not relevant. The past history
showed the patient to have been born a healthy child fol￾lowing a normal labor. His development was normal.
He was reported to have had measles at 2 months of
age, pertussis at 3 years, and repeated attacks of tonsil￾litis up to 2 years ago, when his tonsils and adenoids
were removed.
Physical examination revealed a poorly developed
slightly underweight child. The blood pressure was
260 mm. Hg systolic and 180 mm. Hg diastolic. The
peripheral arteries were thickened. After rest, the blood
pressure varied from 210 to 150 systolic and 160 to 120
diastolic. There was an albuminuric retinitis with hemor￾rhages and exudate. The heart was not enlarged. Fol￾lowing the administration of 0.12 gram of sodium nitrite
by mouth the blood pressure fell from 200 systolic and
150 diastolic to 155 systolic and 130 diastolic, the hands
became cold and fingers and face cyanotic, and the
brachial, cubital and radial arteries became softer. The
urine contained from a very faint trace to a trace of
albumin, moderate and varying numbers of white blood
cells, and occasional hyaline and granular casts. The
urea clearance was 88 per cent of normal and the specific
gravity of the urine varied from 1.020 to 1.005.
One month after admission the pain in the left flank
became severer, the temperature rose to 103° F., the
pyuria became more pronounced, and there was local ten￾derness and fullness in the left kidney region. The white
blood count rose to 22,000. It was at this time that the
lower blood pressures were observed. An exploratory
operation was deemed advisable. Through an incision
running obliquely forward from the left side of the
costovertebral angle the left kidney was exposed. The
kidney was found to be markedly edematous. Toward

General Hospital for the autopsy report.

the lower pole there was a large amount of cellulitis and
a small amount of pus. Nothing was felt in the position
of the adrenal. A drain was inserted to the infected
area and the wound closed in layers to the drain. Pus
drained from the wound for 10 days. The drain was
then removed, and the wound healed well. The urine
continued to show a few white blood cells. The albu￾minuric retinitis had now disappeared. After another 10
days the blood pressure began gradually to increase until
it had again reached 220 systolic and 175 diastolic. At
this time the spinal fluid pressure was 350 mm. H20.
Intravenous pyelograms showed the dye to be well con￾centrated and bilateral enlarged renal pelves and blunted
calyces. The renal function remained unchanged.
On January 2, 1931, a second exploratory operation was
performed through a left rectus incision from the costal
margin to umbilicus and a transverse incision from um￾bilicus to perpendicular line from anterior superior spine.
The right side of the abdomen, right kidney, and supra￾renal was explored and nothing abnormal was made out.
The peritoneum over the left kidney was incised and re￾tracted. There was a moderate amount of inflammation
about the enlarged left kidney. The left adrenal ap￾peared normal.
Following the operation, the blood pressure continued
its gradual rise reaching 250 mm. Hg systolic and 180
mm. Hg diastolic. At this time he had a hypertensive
crisis with convulsions, pallor of left optic disc, and loss
of sight. His heart showed slight left sided hypertrophy
and a systolic murmur was heard at the apex. He re￾covered, regained his vision, and improved sufficiently to
be discharged home to his family physician. The urine
still showed a trace of albumin, rare white and red blood
cells, epithelial cells and granular casts. The blood non￾protein nitrogen was not elevated, the red blood count
was 4,900,000 and hemoglobin 80 per cent. The blood
pressure was 230 mm. Hg systolic and 175 mm. Hg di￾astolic.
He was readmitted to the hospital April 17, 1931, with
cardiac failure. The blood pressure was 140 mm. Hg
systolic and 100 mm. Hg diastolic. The urea clearance
of 79 per cent was normal. He had repeated attacks of
severe abdominal pain and dyspnea relieved by obstructing
the venous return from the lower extremities. The car￾diac decompensation increased, and he died 10 days after
readmission.
Postmortem examination (A-31-68) showed bilateral
chronic pyelonephritis and marked nephrosclerosis.
Streptococcus hemalyticus was recovered from the heart's
blood and from exudate in the right pleural cavity, the
pericardial cavity, and the peritoneal cavity. Of particu￾lar importance in regard to the clinical story were the
findings in the heart and vascular system, and in the
kidneys. The heart was considerably enlarged, more
marked on the left than the right side. On microscopic
examination, diffuse fibrosis of the myocardium was
found. There was generalized atheromatosis of the
aorta. The smaller blood vessels of the pancreas, spleen,
and periadrenal tissues were particularly involved. There
was thickening of both the intima and the media with
definite narrowing of the lumina of these vessels. Con￾siderable perivascular fibrosis was also present.
The kidneys were not weighed but appeared definitely
enlarged. They were firm in consistency and were en￾closed in strongly adherent and thickened capsules to
which the fibrosed periadrenal tissues were firmly at￾tached. On section, the parenchyma was pale, yellowish
brown in color and bulged into the line of incision. The
cortex measured between 4 to 5 mm. in thickness, and
was poorly differentiated from the medulla. No stria￾tions or glomeruli could be recognized on the cut surface.
The small arteries stood out conspicuously because of
their thickened walls. The pelves of both kidneys were
slightly dilated. No exudate was present. The ureters
were of uniform caliber and showed no inflammatory
changes grossly.
Five blocks were selected from the kidneys and sections
were stained by several methods including Mallory's con￾nective tissue stain. The main features were severe in￾fection and vascular lesions. There was a widespread
chronic and acute inflammatory process with considerable
replacement fibrosis and occasional areas of acute inflam￾mation which amounted to abscess formation. In a few
fields, areas of parenchyma were completely necrotic and
were replaced by masses of polymorphonuclear cells.
The connective tissue stroma was edematous and was in￾filtrated with polymorphonuclear cells in scattered areas.
The tubules showed acute degenerative changes. The epi￾thelial lining cells were swollen, granular, and often con￾tained fat or colloid droplets. Within the lumens of the
tubules albuminous precipitate, hyaline and granular casts
and cylinders composed of polymorphonuclear leukocytes
were found. The arterioles were markedly thickened,
and the lumens were decreased in many cases to the point
of complete obliteration. Often, the walls of the arte￾rioles were arranged in concentric rings in the character￾istic onion layer arrangement. No hyaline deposits were
found in the walls of the arterioles. The glomeruli
showed various degrees of hyalinization of the vascular
tufts up to complete hyaline change. Swelling of the
endothelial cells with vacuolization was frequently noted
in the capillaries of the glomeruli. In occasional areas
where the acute inflammatory process in the renal paren￾chyma was most marked, the tufts of the glomeruli were
infiltrated with polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and in￾flammatory cells and fibrin were occasionally noted in
the capsular spaces. Large numbers of glomeruli, how￾ever, retained their normal appearance. (See Figure 1.)
The sequence of events cannot be stated with certainty.
There is definite evidence of both old and recent pyelo￾nephritis. It is impossible to state whether the arteriolar
lesions in the kidney and in other organs of the body
came before or after the initial infection of the kidneys.
The association of vascular lesions of this type and
pyelonephritis has been noted on several occasions in our
laboratory. It should be emphasized, however, that the
vascular lesions are not confined to the kidneys; the small
vessels in the pancreas, spleen, and adrenals were also
involved. The enlargement of the heart and the myo￾carditis are probably secondary to the vascular disease.

PYELONEPHRITIS AND HYPERTENSION
Case 5: P. B. (Hospital Number 187,522), a boy of 7
years, entered the hospital in November 1934 because of
hematuria 3 to 4 times a week for the past two months
and occasional dysuria. The family history was noncon￾tributory. He had had a normal infancy and always
been well except for chickenpox at 4 months of age,
mumps at 2 years and measles at 6 years. Physical ex￾amination showed a well developed and nourished boy
with no abnormal findings. The blood pressure was 98
mm. Hg systolic and 50 mm. Hg diastolic. The urine
contained a slight trace of albumin and was loaded with
red blood cells. A roentgenogram of the abdomen
showed a large solitary calculus at the lower pole of the
right kidney. Intravenous pyelograms two days later
showed the calculus in the region of the lower end of the
right ureter. The right kidney pelvis was considerably
dilated and the calyces were blunted. The right ureter
was not outlined. The left kidney pelvis, calyces, and
ureter were normal. The blood nonprotein nitrogen was
20 mgm. per cent. A phenolsulphonephthalein intra￾muscular test resulted in 30 per cent excretion in the first
hour and 25 per cent excretion in the second hour. The
following day Dr. W. E. Ladd exposed the lower end of
the right ureter and removed the calculus. On analysis,
73 per cent of the dry material was ash composed of cal￾cium oxalate, carbonate, and phosphate. Retrograde py￾elography showed a markedly dilated right kidney pelvis
with blunted calyces and a large tortuous right ureter.
Culture of the urine from the left ureter and bladder
gave no growth. The urine cleared, and the child was
discharged to the outpatient department.
In January 1935, the urine contained many white blood
cells and culture showed a growth of B. coli. In spite of
hexamethylenamine, ammonium chloride and ketogenic
diet therapy the pyuria and bacilluria continued. On
April 5, a right nephrostomy was done by Dr. W. E.
Ladd. At the lower pole of the kidney the fat was ab￾normally adherent, and there were several aberrant ves￾sels, which did not, however, appear to compress the
ureter. The pelvis of the kidney was greatly dilated and
its wall thickened, and the ureter was markedly dilated
and kinked on itself at the level of the lower pole of the
kidney. An incision was made in the surface of the kid￾ney pelvis, and catheter introduced down into the ureter.
The kinking of the latter was partially relieved by free￾ing dense, fibrous tissue, and the catheter could then be
passed without difficulty the whole length of the ureter.
A silk purse string suture was then placed in the mid
point of the convexity of the kidney, and by sharp and
blunt dissection a hole was made through the cortex of
the kidney into the pelvis. A large catheter was inserted
through this and carried out through the original inci￾sion. The renal cortex was much thicker than antici￾pated.
On April 25, a phenolsulphonephthalein intramuscular
test showed 15 per cent excretion from the nephrostomy
drain in 32 cc. in the first hour and 10 per cent in 26 cc.
the second hour. The catheter was removed April 30,
the waund healed well, and the patient was discharged
home May 13 with numerous white blood cells in the
urine specimens.
On August 7 he still had pyuria. He was readmitted
to the hospital on August 13 because of vomiting and
rapid pulse for 5 days. The temperature was normal.
He was cyanotic and dyspneic with respirations 48 and
pulse 140 per minute. The liver was enlarged to the
umbilicus and there was dependent edema. The heart
was large, the diameter measuring 13.5 cm. as compared
to an internal diameter of the chest of 21.4 cm. Aus￾cultation of the heart showed dropped beats. The blood
pressure was 130 mm. Hg systolic and 100 mm. Hg di￾astolic. There had never been any history suggesting
rheumatic fever or any acute infection other than the
pyelonephritis. After digitalization the pulse rate re￾turned to normal, the dropped beats disappeared, there
was a marked diuresis with loss of edema, and the blood
pressure rose to 160 mm. Hg systolic and 105 mm. Hg
diastolic. Urine from the right kidney contained B. coli
and pus, and showed a 3 per cent excretion of intramus￾cularly injected phenolsulphonephthalein in one hour,
while the left kidney gave 16 per cent excretion and no
organisms on culture. A urine concentration test gave a
specific gravity as high as 1.024. The blood nonprotein
nitrogen was 24 mgm. per cent. The sedimentation rate
was normal. As there had been no hematuria or cylin￾druria characteristic of nephritis at any time during this
admission and no drop in blood pressure with the diuresis,
it was felt that an acute hemorrhagic nephritis on top of
the pyelonephritis could not account for the elevated
blood pressure. No source of infection other than the
right pyelonephritis could be found. During the follow￾ing seven weeks the blood pressure varied between 122 to
168 systolic and 90 to 110 diastolic. For the specific pur￾pose of checking the hypertension and cardiac involve￾ment, a right nephrectomy was done by Dr. W. E. Ladd
on October 5. The ureter was found to be greatly di￾lated, tortuous, and to be covered with numerous firm
fibrous adhesions. About two inches above the bladder,
the ureter regained its normal appearance, so at this
point it was clamped, ligated, and cut with cautery.
Examination of the right kidney and ureter showed the
following. The gross specimen consisted of a right kid￾ney measuring approximately 10 X 6 X 3 cm., surrounded
by a moderate amount of deep orange-colored perirenal
fat. The capsule was thick, opaque, and in certain areas
markedly adherent to the kidney surface. The external
surface was a diffuse yellowish-brown in color, stippled
with closely placed deep red punctate areas. Over the
inferior pole was a large, irregular, slightly depressed
dull purplish-red area to which the capsule was markedly
adherent. At the superior pole were smaller discrete
similar areas averaging 0.3 cm. in diameter. The kidney
was moderately firm but boggy and cut with ease reveal￾ing poorly defined cortical and medullary zones. The
cortex was slightly swollen, measuring approximately
0.7 cm. in thickmess, slightly irregular, generally pale
yellowish-brown in color with faint pinkish-gray linear

radiations. At the superior pole there was a dull, moist,
purplish-red, wedge-shaped lesion with a deep red central
area, extending to the tip of an inferior calyx. The
medulla was moist, pale brownish-yellow in color with
faint red linear radiations. The pyramids were pale yel￾lowish-brown, smooth and moist. The pelves and calyces
were greatly dilated with moist, rough granular mucosal
surfaces, dirty bluish-yellow in color flecked with nu￾merous small bright and dark red pin-point lesions. The
ureter was dilated, measuring 2.8 cm. in circumference.
It was redundant and kinked but patent. The mucosa
was swollen, thickened, wrinkled, and dirty yellowish￾gray in color. Numerous small irregular bright red pin￾point lesions were scattered over the mucosal surface.
The specimen was sectioned and fixed in Zenker's solution
and 10 per cent Formalin solution.
Six sections of kidney and two sections of ureter were
stained by various methods including Mallory's connective
tissue stain. There was some thickening, edema, and
lymphocytic infiltration of the capsule. The interstitial
tissues were densely infiltrated by lymphocytes, poly￾morphonuclear leukocytes, and mononuclear cells. In
occasional areas the renal parenchyma was replaced by
polymorphonuclear leukocytes and lymphocytes. In other
areas, lymphocytes were packed so densely that a sug￾gestion of lymph follicle formation was noted. Inflam￾matory changes extended throughout the entire kidney
and were prominent in the subpelvic tissues. The con￾voluted and collecting tubules were dilated, and the lining
epithelium showed cloudy swelling, fragmentation of the
cytoplasm, and in some areas flattening of the epithelium.
Occasional tubules were filled with polymorphonuclear
leukocytes. In many of the glomeruli there was increased
prominence of the basement membrane both in the capil￾lary loops and in the capsule itself. Many glomeruli
were practically bloodless. The basement membrane was
particularly thickened in the areas of greatest inflam￾matory infiltration, and the capsules of the glomeruli
showed fibrosis and hyalinization. In a number of in￾stances there were adhesions between the glomerular
tufts and the capsule. Inflammatory cells in the glomeruli
were lacking. Moderate thickening of both the media
and intima of the smaller arterioles was noted. Edema,
acute and chronic inflammation, and congestion were
noted beneath the mucosa of the ureters. (See Figure 2.)
Postoperatively the blood pressure fell to 100 mm. Hg
systolic and 70 mm. Hg diastolic, and the urine was clear.
During the subsequent 20 months, examination at six
outpatient visits have shown that the heart has been of
normal size, the urine negative for pus and bacteria, the
blood pressure never higher than 115 mm. Hg systolic
and 75 mm. Hg diastolic, and the urea clearance within
normal limits.
Case 6: Dr. J. D. Barney's patiet. A girl 10 years of
age with a history of pyuria of at least two years' dura￾tion was admitted to the hospital March 1937 with a bac￾illuria and a varying number of white blood cells in the
urine and a hypertension of 190 mm. Hg systolic and
120 mm. Hg diastolic pressure. The blood nonprotein
nitrogen and the excretion of phenolsulphonephthalein
were within normal limits. The day following the re￾moval of the right kidney by Dr. Barney the blood pres￾sure fell to 110 mm. Hg systolic and 70 diastolic and
remained below that level during the subsequent stay in
the hospital. Three months later, when the child was
last seen, she appeared to be a healthy active child, and
the blood pressure was 92 systolic and 60 diastolic. Dr.
T. B. Mallory described the kidney as a small irregularly
scarred kidney with dilated pelvis and slightly injected
ureter, which on section showed a most marked thicken￾ing of the media and intima of the arterioles and an in￾filtration of cells in areas throughout the parenchyma and
beneath the epithelium of the pelvis and several calyces.
I wish to acknowledge my indebtedness to Dr. Sidney
Farber for the pathological descriptions of Cases 4 and
5 and for his cooperation in reviewing with me many
cases of pyelonephritis, and to thank Dr. J. D. Barney
and Dr. T. B. Mallory for permitting reference to their
case.
