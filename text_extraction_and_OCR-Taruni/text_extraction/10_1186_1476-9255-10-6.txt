Abstract
Background: Acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are characterized by a
disruption of the endothelium and alveolar epithelial barriers involving increased microvascular permeability, thus
resulting in the set of protein-rich pulmonary edema. Angiogenic factors and their receptors, including vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/VEGF-receptor (VEGFR) and the angiopoietin (Ang)/Tie2 signaling pathways, play
pivotal roles in both angiogenesis and microvascular permeability. The aim of the study was to assess the
relationship between angiogenic factors, their soluble receptors and ALI/ARDS associated with critically ill patients,
including sepsis, severe trauma, and post-cardiac arrest syndrome (PCAS).
Methods: One hundred fifty-nine critically ill patients, including 50 patients with sepsis, 57 patients with severe
trauma and 52 resuscitated after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, were divided into three subgroups: including 25 ALI
patients, 101 ARDS patients and 22 non-ALI/ARDS patients. The serum levels of angiogenic factors were measured
at the time of admission (day 1), as well as day 3 and day 5 and then were compared among the ALI, ARDS and
non-ALI/ARDS groups. Their predictive values for developing ALI/ARDS and 28-day mortality were evaluated.
Results: Higher levels of sVEGFR1 and Ang2 were observed in the ALI and ARDS patients than in the non-ALI/ARDS
patients during the entire study period. The Ang2/Ang1 ratio in the ARDS group was also significantly higher than
that in the non-ALI/ADRS group. The sVEGFR2 levels in the ARDS group on day 1 were significantly lower than
those of the non-ALI/ADRS group. In addition, significant positive correlations were seen between the sVEGFR1,
Ang2, Ang2/Ang1, and the development of ALI/ARDS in critical illness. There were also significant negative
correlations between the minimal value of sVEGFR2, the maximal value of Ang1 and the ALI/ARDS group. In
particular, sVEGFR2 and Ang2 were independent predictors of developing ALI/ARDS. Moreover, Ang2 and sVEGFR2
also independently predicted the mortality in ALI/ARDS patients.
Conclusions: Angiogenic factors and their soluble receptors, particularly sVEGFR2 and Ang2, are thus considered to
be valuable predictive biomarkers in the development of ALI/ARDS associated with critical illness and mortality in
ALI/ARDS patients.

Background
Acute lung injury (ALI) and its most severe manifest￾ation, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), are
clinically defined as a severe dysfunction of gas exchange
and chest radiographic abnormalities in the absence of
heart failure [1,2]. ALI/ARDS are devastating complica￾tions of numerous severe conditions, including severe
sepsis, severe trauma, and ischemia/reperfusion injury.
ALI/ARDS are characterized by a disruption of the endo￾thelium and alveolar epithelial barriers involving increased
microvascular permeability, thus resulting in the set of
protein-rich pulmonary edema [3,4]. Novel mediators that
may be involved in ALI/ARDS are angiogenic factors, in￾cluding vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/VEGF
receptor (VEGFR) signaling pathway and the angiopoietin
(Ang)/Tie2 signaling pathway.
VEGF is a glycoprotein that is synthesized and released
by vascular endothelial cells, lung epithelium, platelet,
and leukocytes [5]. VEGF can enhance angiogenesis and
increase microvascular permeability through binding
with the VEGFR, which may thus lead to edema and
hypotension [5,6]. VEGF mainly binds to two transmem￾brane receptors, VEGF receptor-1 (VEGFR1) and VEGFR2.
VEGFR2, which is selectively expressed in the endothe￾lium, mainly mediates endothelial growth, survival signals,
proliferation and permeability and pathological angiogen￾esis. In contrast, VEGFR1, which is present both on endo￾thelial cells and monocytes, plays an important role by
increasing the vascular permeability under pathological
conditions, such as ischemia and inflammation.
The angiopoietin (Ang)-Tie2 ligand-receptor system is
restricted to the regulation of the endothelium and it is
also involved in multiple organ dysfunction-related path￾ways [7]. The Ang-Tie2 system not only regulates angio￾genesis, but it also controls endothelial inflammation,
along with VEGF and its receptor system [8]. Ang1 sta￾bilizes the endothelial cells, inhibits vascular leakage, and
suppresses inflammatory and coagulation-related gene ex￾pression through Tie2 activation [8-10]. Ang2 antagonizes
the binding of Ang1 to Tie2. Therefore, Ang2 is thought
to act as a proinflammatory mediator increasing fluid
leakage through the endothelial vasculature [11]. However,
Ang2 promotes cell survival in the presence of VEGF [12].
Several studies have demonstrated the ratio of Ang1 to
Ang2 to better describe the state of activation of the endo￾thelium, because Ang1 and Ang2 have agonist–antagonist
properties on the endothelium [13,14].
This study investigated the hypothesis that the angio￾genic factors play pivotal roles in the development of
ALI/ARDS, thus leading to a poor prognosis in critically
ill patients. The present study examined the serial changes
in serum angiogenic factors and their soluble receptors in
ALI/ARDS associated with critical illness, including severe
trauma, sepsis, and PCAS. The study also investigated the
relationships between these factors and the development
of ALI/ARDS and their mortality.
Methods
Patients
Approval for this study was obtained from the institu￾tional review board, the Ethics Committee of Hokkaido
University School of Medicine. Informed consent for this
study was obtained from the patients’ next of kin. Sys￾temic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), sepsis, se￾vere sepsis, and septic shock were defined according to
the American College of Chest Physicians/Society of Crit￾ical Care Medicine consensus conference as previously
published [15]. Infection was defined as any localization
with clinical evidence of infection and the identification of
microorganisms grown from bacteriological samples. Se￾vere trauma patients were defined as those with an Injury
Severity Score (ISS) ≥ 9 (at least one abbreviated Injury
Scale ≥ 3) [16]. Cardiac arrest was defined as the absence
of a palpable pulse confirmed by an emergency medical
service. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed in
accordance with the Guidelines 2000 for Cardiopulmon￾ary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care
[17]. Fifteen healthy volunteers served as the control sub￾jects. The patient sources were the same as that described
in our previous studies (severe trauma; [18], sepsis; [19],
PCAS; [20]).
Definitions
ARDS was defined based on the American-European
Consensus Conference on ARDS [1].The severity of ill￾ness of the patients was evaluated according to the
Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APA￾CHE) II score at the time of enrollment [21]. Organ dys￾function was assessed by the Sequential Organ Failure
Assessment (SOFA) score within 24 hr after arrival at
the emergency department (day1), as well as on days 3
and 5 [22]. All patients received mechanical ventilation
in a pressure-controlled and pressure support ventilation
mode with a positive end-expiratory pressure. Ventilator
management was performed based on a lung protective
strategy as designed by the ARDS network [23]. We
defined the maximum score (max) or minimum score
(min) as the highest or lowest score on day1, day3 and
day5, when we collected the patient data and samples.
Study protocol and measurement methods
Blood samples were collected by an arterial catheter
within 12 hours after arrival at the emergency depart￾ment (day1), as well as on days 3 and 5. The blood was
immediately placed into individual tubes and centrifuged
at 3,000 rpm, for 5 min at 4°C. The serum samples were
stored at −80°C until used for the assay.

The following variables were measured in duplicate:
VEGF (Quantikine; R&D systems, Inc. Human VEGF,
Minneapolis, MN, USA); sVEGFR1 (Quantikine; R&D
systems, Inc. Human sVEGF R1/Flt-1, Minneapolis,
MN, USA); sVEGFR2 (Quantikine; R&D systems, Inc.
Human sVEGF R2/KDR/Flk-1, Minneapolis, MN, USA);
Ang1 (Quantikine; R&D systems, Inc. Human Angiopoie￾tin-1, Minneapolis, MN, USA); Ang2 (Quantikine; R&D
systems, Inc. Human Angiopoietin-2, Minneapolis, MN,
USA); and soluble Tie2 receptor (sTie2) (Quantikine;
R&D systems, Inc. Human Tie-2, Minneapolis, MN,
USA).
Statistical analysis
The statistical analyses and calculations were performed
with the SPSS 19.0 software package (SPSS, Inc, Chicago,
IL, USA). Differences between the two groups were ana￾lyzed using a two-sided nonparametric Mann–Whitney
U test, and categorical variables were compared using
Pearson’s chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test when
required. The Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance was
used to compare the 3 groups. A stepwise logistic re￾gression analysis was used to assess the relationship
between the development of ALI/ARDS and the age,
gender, APACHE II score, SIRS max, VEGF min,
sVEGFR2 max, sVEGFR2 min, Ang1 min, Ang2 max,
Ang2/Ang1 max, and sTie2 max by referencing the
results of any serial changes for all angiogenic factors. A
stepwise logistic regression analysis was also performed
to assess the relationship between the 28-day mortality
in ALI/ARDS patients and the same parameters. Vari￾ables found to be statistically significant at a 10% level
according to a univariate analysis were included in the
multivariable model. The results of the regression were
reported as the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence
intervals (CI). A p-value < 0.05 was considered to be sta￾tistically significant. All results were expressed as the
means ± SEM, unless otherwise stated.
Results
Patients’ characteristics
One-hundred-fifty-nine critically ill patients, including
50 patients with sepsis, 57 patients with severe trauma
and 52 resuscitated out-of hospital cardiac arrest patients,
were divided into three subgroups: including 25 ALI
patients, 101 ARDS patients and 22 non-ALI/ARDS
patients. The baseline characteristics of the patients are
shown in Table 1. ALI and ARDS groups had significantly
higher APACHE II scores (p = 0.003) and maximal SOFA
scores (p < 0.001), although the maximal SIRS scores was
not significantly different among three groups (p = 0.172).
The outcome did not achieve the significant difference
among three groups.
Serial changes in angiogenic factors and their soluble
receptors
Serial changes in the circulating VEGF, sVEGFR1, and
sVEGFR2 levels are presented in Figure 1. The VEGF
levels showed no significant differences between non-ALI/
ALDS and ALI/ARDS groups. Although the sVEGFR1
levels did not differ between non-ALI/ARDS and control
groups, the sVEGFR1 levels in the ALI and ARDS groups
were significantly higher than those of the control and
non-ALI/ARDS groups during the entire study period
(non-ALI/ARDS group vs. ALI group: day 1, p = 0.001;
day 3, p = 0.001; day 5, p = 0.016, non-ALI/ARDS group:
day 1, p = 0.001; day 3, p < 0.001; day 5, p < 0.001). All
three groups showed significantly lower levels of sVEGFR2
in comparison to the controls. In particular, those in the
ARDS group showed significantly lower sVEGFR2 levels
on day 1 in comparison to non-ALI/ARDS subjects (p =
0.011). Figure 2 presents the Ang1, Ang2, sTie2 levels and
the Ang2/Ang1 ratio. Although the Ang1 levels in all
three groups were lower than those in control subjects,
there were no significant differences between the non￾ALI/ARDS and ALI/ARDS patients. On the contrary, the
Ang2 levels in ALI/ADRS were significantly higher than
those in the non-ALI/ARDS patients during the study
period and the effects were more prominent in ARDS
patients (non-ARDS vs. ARDS: day 1, p < 0.001; day 3,
p < 0.001; day 5, p < 0.001). Therefore, the Ang2/Ang1
ratio significantly increased in ARDS patients (non￾ARDS vs. ARDS: day 1, p = 0.010; day 3, p < 0.001; day 5,
p = 0.001). The sTie2 levels were not significantly differ￾ent between non-ALI/ADRS and ALI/ARDS groups.

Relationships between angiogenic factors, their soluble
receptors and ALI/ARDS
The following variables were found to be statistically
significant at a 10% level in the univariate analysis and
subjected to multivariate logistic regression analysis: age,
APACHE II, minimum value of VEGF, and maximum
values of sVEGFR1, Ang2, and Ang2/Ang1. Except for
sVEGFR2 (p = 0.021) and Ang2 (p = 0.025), all other
variables did not remain significant in the multivariable
setting (Table 2).

Relationships between angiogenic factors, their soluble
receptors and 28-day mortality in ALI/ARDS patients
Table 3 shows that there were significant positive corre￾lations between APACHE II, the maximum values of
Ang2, Ang2/Ang1 ratio, and 28-day mortality in ALI/
ARDS associated with critical illness. Negative correla￾tions were also observed between the minimal value of
sVEGFR2 and mortality. In particular, APACHE score,
the maximum value of Ang2 and the minimum value of
sVEGFR2 were also strong, independent prognostic fac￾tors for the 28-day mortality in ALI/ARDS associated
with critical illness.
Discussion
The present study have demonstrated that ALI/ARDS
patients associated with critical illness showed significant
increases in their APACHE II scores, SOFA scores,
sVEGFR1 and Ang2 levels as well as in the Ang2/Ang1
ratio, and decreases in their sVEGFR2. In particular, the
maximum value of Ang2 and the minimal value of
sVEGFR2 were the most prominent predictors of devel￾opment of ALI/ARDS in critically ill patients. In
addition, Ang2 max and sVEGFR2 min predicted the 28-
day mortality in ALI/ARDS patients.
The systemic overexpression of VEGF plays a pivotal
role in the development of pulmonary edema [24]. On
the other hand, some animal studies and clinical data
support a protective role for VEGF in ALI/ARDS [24].
Moreover, lower VEGF levels are also associated with
organ dysfunction and a poor outcome in patients with
sepsis [25]. Several studies have reported that the plasma
VEGF levels in the patients with septic shock are higher
than those of patients without shock, and that the VEGF
concentration at the time of admission correlates with
the severity of disease [26]. Therefore, the levels of VEGF
in patients with sepsis, septic shock and other critical ill￾nesses remain controversial [5,13,18]. Several previous
studies have demonstrated plasma to be the preferred
medium because the platelet-mediated secretion of VEGF
during the clotting process could elevate the levels of
VEGF [19,27]. Platelets are one of the main transporters of
circulating VEGF, and VEGF is released from platelets by
following their thrombin-induced activation. Critically ill
patients are often affected by disseminated intravascular
coagulation (DIC). The values of VEGF measured in serum
samples may therefore decrease because of DIC induced
platelet consumption.
The present study found the sVEGFR1 levels in ALI/
ARDS patients to be significantly higher than those of
non-ALI/ARDS patients during the entire study period.
VEGF and VEGFR1 on the cell surface are up-regulated
after endothelial injury, promoting reendothelialization
by enhancing vascular remodeling [28]. These results
suggest that higher sVEGFR1 levels may hamper VEGF
signaling in the process of endothelial repair, thereby
leading to disease progression and organ dysfunction
[5,29]. Furthermore, high circulating sVRGFR1 levels
correlate with morbidity and mortality, and are a potent
marker of disease severity in septic or critically ill
patients [5,26]. The current results were consistent with
these previous studies.
VEGFR2 is a high-affinity receptor for VEGF and is
regarded as the main signaling receptor for VEGF bio￾activity, including angiogenesis, proliferation and perme￾ability [30,31]. The present study found that the levels of
sVEGFR2 in ARDS patients were lower than those of non￾ALI/ARDS patients. Moreover, the decrease in sVEGFR2
predicted the development of ALI/ARDS. sVRGFR2 is a

soluble truncated form of VEGFR2 [18]. The reduction of
the sVEGFR2 level found in the current study might result
from reduced shedding of the membrane-integrated form
of VEGFR2 [32]. This result may reflect the augmentation
of VEGF/VGFR2 signaling pathway, namely exacerbation
of pulmonary vascular permeability, leading to ALI/ARDS.
This is the first report evaluating the relationship between
the sVEGFR2 and ALI/ARDS.
Previous studies indicated that lower Ang1 and higher
Ang2 levels are associated with a poor outcome in
patients with sepsis or critical illness [9,20,25,33,34].
Ang1 has anti-inflammatory properties and protects
against vascular leakage, while Ang2 promotes inflam￾mation and increases the vascular permeability, leading
to the development of ARDS [9,34-36]. Moreover, posi￾tive relationships between Ang2 and inflammatory cyto￾kines, such as TNF-alpha and IL-6, have been observed
[36]. These results suggest that elevations in Ang2 and a
decrease in Ang1 may reflect a pro-inflammatory state
and that this is best summarized by the ratio between
Ang1 and Ang2 [13,14]. The current study and previous
studies suggest that a higher Ang2 level, as well as an
imbalance of Ang1 and Ang2 (high Ang2/Ang1 ratio)
are both associated with inflammation during critical ill￾ness, thus resulting in ALI/ARDS. The administration of
Ang1 protects the vasculature from leakage, thereby
countering the potentially lethal actions of VEGF and in￾flammatory agents in animal experiments [37,38]. Calfee
et al. reported that the Ang2 levels are affected by the
treatment strategies, and that lower Ang2 levels were
observed after fluid conservative therapy, which may be
beneficial as a result of decreasing the endothelial in￾flammation in patients with acute lung injury [34]. These
results imply that correcting the imbalances between
Ang1 and Ang2 by either administering Ang1 or inhibit￾ing Ang2 may represent a new therapeutic strategy for
severe inflammatory illnesses, such as ARDS.
Soluble Tie2 (sTie2) is released by the proteolytic
cleavage of the extracellular domain by matrix metallo￾proteases, which occurs constitutively or after VEGF
signaling [39]. Cleaved sTie2 binds to both Ang1 and
Ang2 to inhibit ligand-mediated Tie2 receptor activa￾tion and downstream signaling [40]. The sTie2 levels
correlate with the VEGF levels, supporting the in vivo
shedding of Tie2 through VEGF signaling [41]. The sTie2
levels showed no significant changes between the non￾ALI/ARDS groups and ALI/ARDS groups in the present
study. sTie2 was previously shown to be higher in sep￾tic than in non-septic patients [41]. However, this in￾crease does not rule out a direct role for Ang1 and
Ang2 in pulmonary vascular permeability in both sep￾tic and non-septic critically ill patients. These results
as well as those of a present study suggest that Ang1
and Ang2, especially Ang2, but not sTie2, may be
involved in the capillary leakage in ALI/ARDS patients
with critical illness.
Conclusion
This study demonstrated that there were lower sVEGFR2
levels on day 1 and higher sVEGFR1 and Ang2 levels,
and an increased Ang2/Ang1 ratio during the entire
study period in patients with ALI/ARDS associated with
critical illness, including sepsis, severe trauma, and
PCAS. sVEGFR2 and Ang2 were found to be independ￾ent predictors of the development of ALI/ARDS in
critically ill patients. In addition, sVEGFR2 and Ang2 in￾dependently predict the 28-day mortality in ALI/ARDS
patients associated with critical illness. It should be
noted that not only Ang2, but also sVEGFR2, both play
a pivotal role in the development of ALI/ARDS in cases
of critical illness and can predict the 28-day mortality in
ALI/ARDS patients.
