Abstract
Background: The right ventricle (RV) often fails when functioning as the systemic ventricle, but the cause is not
understood. We tested the hypothesis that myofiber organization is abnormal in the failing systemic right ventricle.
Methods: We used diffusion-weighted cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging to examine 3 failing hearts
explanted from young patients with a systemic RV and one structurally normal heart with postnatally acquired RV
hypertrophy for comparison. Diffusion compartment imaging was computed to separate the free diffusive
component representing free water from an anisotropic component characterizing the orientation and diffusion
characteristics of myofibers. The orientation of each anisotropic compartment was displayed in glyph format and
used for qualitative description of myofibers and for construction of tractograms. The helix angle was calculated
across the ventricular walls in 5 locations and displayed graphically. Scalar parameters (fractional anisotropy and
mean diffusivity) were compared among specimens.
Results: The hypertrophied systemic RV has an inner layer, comprising about 2/3 of the wall, composed of
hypertrophied trabeculae and an epicardial layer of circumferential myofibers. Myofibers within smaller trabeculae
are aligned and organized with parallel fibers while larger, composite bundles show marked disarray, largely
between component trabeculae. We observed a narrow range of helix angles in the outer, compact part of the wall
consistent with aligned, approximately circumferential fibers. However, there was marked variation of helix angle in
the inner, trabecular part of the wall consistent with marked variation in fiber orientation. The apical whorl was
disrupted or incomplete and we observed myocardial whorls or vortices at other locations. Fractional anisotropy
was lower in abnormal hearts while mean diffusivity was more variable, being higher in 2 but lower in 1 heart,
compared to the structurally normal heart.
Conclusions: Myofiber organization is abnormal in the failing systemic RV and might be an important substrate for
heart failure and arrhythmia. It is unclear if myofiber disorganization is due to hemodynamic factors, developmental
problems, or both.

Introduction
The myocardium is a highly anisotropic tissue, with myo￾cytes (long axis approximately 10 times the transverse axis)
organized into parallel bundles. The organization of myofi￾bers appears to be important for heart function and elec￾trical conduction. Early studies of myofiber organization
were performed using histological sections [1, 2]. More re￾cently diffusion-weighted (DW) cardiovascular magnetic
resonance (CMR), a non-destructive technique that can
yield a 3D data set, has been used to investigate myofiber
architecture [3]. DW imaging uses the propensity of water
molecules to diffuse within a tissue to characterize its struc￾ture. The principal eigenvector of the diffusion tensor mea￾sured in each voxel of the image indicates the direction of
the long axis of myocytes in that voxel. The data from each
voxel of the 3D data set are then combined to create a map
of myofiber orientation (tractogram) over part or all of the
myocardium. In addition to vector parameters, scalar pa￾rameters such as mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional an￾isotropy (FA), provide other information about myocardial
structure [4–6]. MD measures the mean rate of water diffu￾sion, with higher values indicating more unrestricted, extra￾cellular space due, for example, to edema or cell lysis. FA
describes the degree of anisotropy of the diffusion process
and is thought to be a measure of tissue microstructural in￾tegrity. While this has been demonstrated in neural tissue,
it is less clear in myocardium.
Pathological states, including some genetic cardiomy￾opathies as well as myocardial infarction, have been
shown to be associated with abnormal tissue structure
as indicated by abnormal MD and FA values as well as
disarray of myofibers seen in tractograms [6, 7]. We hy￾pothesized that myoarchitecture might be abnormal in
some patients with congenital heart defects and heart
failure and/or arrhythmia. In particular, we suspected
that the architecture of a right ventricle (RV) serving as
the systemic ventricle might be particularly affected, in
part because of the bizarre gross appearance of these
ventricles. We suspected that abnormal myoarchitecture
might be an important contributor to the high preva￾lence of heart failure and arrhythmia seen in this subset
of congenital heart disease patients late after surgical
palliation [8, 9].
In this work, we tested our hypothesis that myofiber
architecture is abnormal in the systemic RV of
explanted, failing hearts using ex vivo DW CMR.
Methods
Patients
The explanted hearts from 3 patients with a systemic RV
and from 1 patient with a structurally normal heart with
acquired RV hypertrophy were examined. The families
gave consent for the hearts to be used for research and
the protocol was approved by the institutional review
board (IRB) (IRBP00016280).
Heart preparation
The explanted hearts were fixed (5% formalin and 50%
ethanol) under 10 cm of water distending pressure and
immersed in Galden® (Kurt J. Lesker Company, Jefferson
Hills, Pennsylvania, USA) for imaging. Each heart was
packaged in a sealed, close-fitting bag to minimize the
distance between the CMR coil and the sample. Care
was taken to remove microscopic air bubbles to reduce
B1 field inhomogeneity so that susceptibility geometric
and intensity distortion were minimized.
Diffusion imaging
All imaging was performed on a 3 T CMR system (Skyra,
Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, German) with a pulsed
gradient spin echo sequence and single shot echo planar
imaging (EPI) readout pulse sequence. We have used the
posterior part of the 64-channel head coil at the bottom
of the sample and a 7 cm loop coil at the top of the sam￾ple to increase signal and coverage. Eddy current distor￾tion was minimized by utilizing a twice-refocused spin
echo sequence [10]. Scan parameters were adapted for
each case to account for variations in heart size (Table 1).
The main reason for different spatial resolution in each
acquisition was due to the condition of the ex-vivo spec￾imens. Depending on the post-mortem interval and fix￾ation, each sample had a different CMR T2 contrast and
total signal, leading to a different signal-to-noise (SNR)
per unit time. CMR acquisition parameters were tuned
to compensate for that and to allow robust DWI fitting
for each sample. Higher spatial resolution images were
also acquired with smaller specimens (Double-Inlet RV
(DIRV), RV hypertrophy (RVH 'normal') to maintain de￾tails, while the number of averages was increased to
compensate for loss of SNR associated with high￾resolution imaging. The diffusion gradient schemes in￾cluded a multi-shell (4 b = 0 images and 3 shells at b =
1000, 1500, 2000s/mm2 of 30 gradients each) and the
CUSP90 Scheme [11], (12 b=0 images and 78 gradients
with 400 s/mm2 < b < 3000 s/mm2) which allowed im￾aging with lower echo time (TE) than a multi-shell, pro￾viding a substantial SNR boost. EPI is highly sensitive to
magnetic field inhomogeneities caused by susceptibility
changes due to air bubbles in ex-vivo imaging. This re￾sults in severe distortion along the phase-encoding dir￾ection. First, susceptibility distortions were prospectively
minimized by careful packaging of the specimens. Sec￾ond, the number of phases encodes in the phase encod￾ing direction was minimized by reducing field-of-view
(FOV) in this direction for each case to reduce the amp￾litude of distortion caused by any residual microscopic
bubbles. Finally, the entire gradient scheme was repeated
Campanale et al. Journal of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (2020) 22:49 Page 2 of 13

with opposite phase encoding directions (anterior-posterior
(AP) and posterior-anterior (PA), see Table 1) to allow esti￾mation of the susceptibility-induced off-resonance field and
correction of both geometric and intensity distortion using
Topup [12]. A single average scan required ~ 40 min, with
an entire specimen scan requiring 6–10 h depending on the
size.
We characterized the tissue microstructure using dif￾fusion compartment imaging (DCI) [13] estimated from
the multi b-value acquisition. The most commonly used
DW-CMR technique is diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)
[14] which is well known to conflate the signal arising
from the various tissue microstructures in each voxel by
estimating a simplified single diffusion tensor, resulting
in reduced specificity in describing the specific nature of
pathological tissue changes. DCI, instead, considers that
the signal in each voxel arises from a finite number of
large-scale, microstructural environments in slow ex￾change, and uses a multi b-value acquisition to disentan￾gle them. We considered a DCI model with one free
diffusive component at each voxel to represent the con￾tribution of free diffusion and one anisotropic compo￾nent to characterize the orientation and diffusion
characteristics of myofibers. Each compartment was
modeled using a continuous, peak-shaped, statistical dis￾tribution of diffusion tensors [13], allowing us to capture
both the average compartment diffusivity and its micro￾structural heterogeneity. The free diffusion was modeled
mostly to account for partial voluming at the tissue
interface. We chose in this work to focus our quantita￾tive analysis on the source of anisotropy in the tissue, i.e.
the myofibers.
Image display and analysis
The orientation of each anisotropic compartment was
displayed in glyph format and used for qualitative de￾scription of myofibers (MisterI, www.benoitscherrer.
com/MisterI/) and for construction of tractograms
(FiberNavigator) [15].
The helix angle was computed across the ventricular
wall in 5 evenly spaced locations using MisterI software.
The long axis of the ventricle was constructed as a line
from the center of the AV valve to the apex of the ven￾tricle (Fig. 1). A short-axis plane was constructed
perpendicular to the long axis and used as the 0° reference
for the helix angle. The helix angle was measured as the
angle between the principal eigenvector of the anisotropic
compartment projected on a plane tangent to the epicar￾dium and the short-axis plane of the ventricle. To our
knowledge, there is no convention for describing the helix
angle of the RV as there is for the left ventricle (LV) [7].
We assigned positive angles to fibers oriented superiorly
and toward the apex when viewed from outside the ven￾tricular wall with the heart in anatomic position, and a
negative angle to fibers oriented superiorly and toward the
base of the heart. We recognize that the myocardium is a
syncytium composed of bundles of elongated myocytes
joined by gap junctions and surrounded by perimysium
rather than individual myofibers. We use the term myofi￾bers to aid in the visualization and conceptualization of
the diffusion streamlines displayed in the tractograms and
tensor fields.
DCI allows characterization of diffusion scalar parame￾ters such as FA and MD that are specific to each com￾partment, therefore referred to as compartment FA
(cFA) and compartment MD (cMD). cFA and cMD
values were computed at each voxel and average values
were derived for each specimen as a whole and for each
of their walls (free walls of the RV and LV for biventri￾cular hearts and right and left walls for univentricular
hearts).
Histology
Blocks of ventricular myocardium were removed after
imaging, sectioned, mounted and stained, photographed,
and stored digitally for comparison with diffusion data.
The heart specimen was imaged with computed tomog￾raphy following removal of tissue samples and a 3D re￾construction created (MisterI). The diffusion images
were then overlaid on the 3D image to localize the sites
for comparison with histology.
Statistics
The quantitative statistical analysis was carried out using
Stata (StataCorp. 2015. Stata Statistical Software: Release
14. College Station, Texas, USA). We used 1-way
ANOVA to test the significance of differences in global
means among the 4 hearts. We then used a Mann￾Table 1 Imaging Parameters

Results
Patients
Patient 1 is a 14-year-old boy with mitral atresia/aortic
atresia (MA/AA) who underwent Norwood palliation as
a neonate, a bi-directional Glenn anastomosis at 10
months of age and fenestrated lateral tunnel Fontan op￾eration at 3 years of age. The fenestration was closed
(device closure) at 6 years of age. By 12 years he had de￾veloped increasing exercise intolerance, edema and asci￾tes. Echocardiography showed moderate to marked
global RV systolic dysfunction and mild-moderate tricus￾pid regurgitation (Supp Video 1, Fig. 2a). Exercise testing
showed severely depressed peak workload and peak
VO2. Cardiac catheterization showed low cardiac output
(2.1 L/min/M2
) and elevated RV filling pressure (18
mmHg) with pulmonary vein desaturation (88–92%).
Symptoms progressed and he underwent orthotopic
heart transplantation at age 14 years.
Patient 2 is a 5-year-old girl with DIRV and double￾outlet RV (DORV) who underwent balloon septostomy and
pulmonary valve dilation as a neonate because of cyanosis.
At 6 months of age she underwent bi-directional Glenn
anastomosis and atrial septectomy. At 2.5 years she under￾went fenestrated lateral tunnel Fontan operation, with de￾vice closure of the fenestration 6 weeks later. By 5 years she
had developed increased fatigue and abdominal pain with
exercise. An echocardiogram showed severely depressed
global RV systolic function with minimal left AV valve re￾gurgitation (Supp Video 2, Fig. 2b). A catheterization
showed normal cardiac output (3.1 L/min/M2
), mean pres￾sure in the Fontan circuit of 10–11 mmHg, wedge and RV
filling pressure of 6 mmHg, and no coronary obstruction.
She became increasingly symptomatic with limited activity,
abdominal pain, and failure to gain weight. She underwent
orthotopic heart transplantation at 5 years of age.
Patient 3 is a 19-year-old man with congenitally
physiologically corrected transposition of the great arter￾ies (C-TGA), atrio-ventricular and ventriculo-arterial
discordance, who underwent closure of a ventricular
septal defect at 3 months of age. By age 10 years he had
begun to have reduced stamina. Echocardiography
showed moderately decreased RV systolic function
which progressed to severe global dysfunction by age
16 years (Supp Video 3, Fig. 2c). Exercise testing
showed severely decreased peak workload and peak
VO2. An implantable cardioverter-defibrillator was
placed at age 16 years because of ventricular tachycar￾dia. Cardiac catheterization showed a low cardiac out￾put (1.9 L/min/M2
), markedly elevated RV filling
pressure (33 mmHg), pulmonary artery hypertension
(1/2 systemic), and elevated systemic venous pressure
(12 mmHg). Heart failure progressed leading to in￾patient treatment with inotropic support and heart
transplantation at age 19 years.

illustrating the convention we have used for helix angle as
described in the Methods. First, the long axis (LA) of the ventricle
was constructed as a line from the center of the tricuspid valve
annulus (TV Ann) to the apex of the right ventricle (RV Apex). A
short-axis plane (SA) was then constructed perpendicular to the
long axis of the ventricle. The SA plane was considered 0°. Fibers
running superiorly and toward the base were assigned a negative
helix angle (−Θ) and those directed superiorly and toward the apex
a positive helix angle (+Θ). LV – left ventricle; Septum –

The red epicardial fibers (dashed arrow +Θ) are directed superiorly
and toward the apex with a positive helix angle. In contrast, the
blue endocardial fibers (dashed arrow –Θ) pass superiorly and
toward the base with a negative helix angle. The green fibers at the
acute margin (curved solid arrow 0°) are circumferential epicardial
fibers. Color coding varies from sample to sample according to the
scan direction and will be indicated in each figure showing glyphs
and tractograms

RVH (‘normal’)
For comparison, a heart with postnatally acquired RVH
was obtained at autopsy from a 1-year old boy who died
from idiopathic pulmonary vein stenosis (Fig. 2d).
Systemic RV
The systemic RV is markedly hypertrophied and often
bizarrely shaped (Fig. 2a, b, c – left panel). An endocar￾dial layer, comprising about 2/3 of the wall thickness, is
Fig. 2 The formalin-fixed specimen (left) and DW CMR tensor field (right) in linear glyph format of explanted hearts from: a- a 16yo with mitral
and aortic atresia (MA/AA), b- a 5 yo with double-inlet, double-outlet RV (DIRV), c- a 19yo with physiologically corrected transposition of the great
arteries, atrio-ventricular and ventriculo-arterial discordance (C-TGA) and d- a 1yo boy with a structurally normal heart and postnatally acquired RV
hypertrophy (RVH ‘normal’). In the 3 hearts with a systemic RV there is an outer compact, circumferential layer (C) and a thicker inner trabecular
layer (T) with bundles of fibers running at large angles to each other. The RVH ‘normal’ heart was smaller than the other 3. Expanding the image
to match the size of the other 3 hearts resulted in lower density of glyphs in the tensor field image. It has an external compact layer of nearly
circumferential fibers with more longitudinally oriented, discrete fiber bundles internally, similarly to what has been reported for a normal RV but
with thicker layers due to hypertrophy
Campanale et al. Journal of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (2020) 22:49 Page 5 of 13

composed of hypertrophied, intermeshing trabeculae
and an epicardial compact layer of approximately cir￾cumferential myofibers is recognizable around most of
the RV. Glyph representation of myofiber organization
indicates that the outer compact layer is composed of
parallel, approximately circumferential fibers while the
trabecular layer is composed of bundles of fibers often
running at large angles to each other (Fig. 2a, b, c – right
panel, Supp Video 4, 5). In contrast, the structurally
normal heart with RVH (RVH 'normal') has an external
compact layer of nearly circumferential fibers with more
longitudinally oriented, discrete fiber bundles internally
(Fig. 2d, Supp Video 4, 5). This is similar to what has
been reported for a normal RV [16], but with thicker
layers due to hypertrophy.
Plotting the helix angle of myofibers across the ven￾tricular wall confirms the patterns described above
(Fig. 3). In the structurally normal heart with RVH
(RVH ‘normal’) (Fig. 3, bottom panel, right side), the
helix angle of fibers in the outer half of the wall is be￾tween + 17.5° and + 47.3° (+ 27.4° ± 10.8°, mean ± SD), in￾dicating fibers running nearly circumferentially but
directed slightly superiorly and apically. There is an
abrupt shift at midwall to a helix angle of − 70.5° (min)
to + 40.4° (max) (− 35.5° ± 40.4°, mean ± SD), indicating
endocardial fibers running more longitudinally, but di￾rected somewhat superiorly and basally. This pattern is
consistent with what has been described previously in
the normal RV [16].
The patterns in the systemic RV are very different
from the RVH ‘normal’ as well as from descriptions of
the normal RV from the literature [16]. We also ob￾served differences in the myoarchitecture between the 2
sides of the RV in the MA/AA and DIRV hearts which
was most apparent on helix angle analysis. The wall on
the left side of the MA/AA heart, presumably where the
LV should have developed, is composed predominantly
of compact myocardium (Fig. 3, top panel, left side; sup￾plementary video 4). The helix angle progression across
the wall is somewhat like the normal LV, − 18.7° ± 12.7°
(mean ± SD)° at the epicardial surface and + 28.1° ± 20.7°
(mean ± SD) at the endocardial surface, but the progres￾sion is not smooth as seen in the normal LV, with a plat￾eau around 0° at mid wall. On the right side of the heart
(presumptive RV free wall) (Fig. 3, top panel, right side),
the outer compact layer has a helix angle of + 9.9° ±
11.6° (mean ± SD)°, indicating nearly circumferential fi￾bers, slightly angled up and toward the apex, while the

the free walls of the ventricles along a transmural line normal to a line tangent at the epicardial surface. Data were plotted from epicardial
surface (left) to endocardial surface (right) with each line (varying shades of blue) representing one of the 5 positions around the ventricle

inner trabecular region showed marked dispersion of the
helix angle, ranging from about − 74.6° (min) to + 67.8°
(max) (+ 27.2° ± 32.0°, mean ± SD), consistent with myo￾cardial fibers at large angles with each other. The fiber
pattern in the DIRV leftward wall (Fig. 3, 2nd panel, left
side) is also reminiscent of the normal LV, with progres￾sion of helix angles from − 34.2° to + 27.6° (+ 2.5 ± 14.1°,
mean ± SD) at the epicardial surface to + 7.3° to + 61.5°
(+ 32.5° ± + 10.7°, mean ± SD) at the endocardial surface,
but without the plateau at midwall (supplementary
video 5). In addition, there was some dispersion of helix
angles near the endocardial surface. The pattern in the
rightward wall (Fig. 3, 2nd panel, right side) was similar
to the rightward wall in the MA/AA heart, but with even
more dispersion of the helix angles in the inner 2/3 of
the wall (Supp video 5), with progression from − 2.0° to
+ 27.3° in the epicardial layer (+ 16.2° ± 6.6°, mean ± SD),
and from − 72.5° to + 81.9° in the inner, trabecular layer
(+ 4.8° ± 43.8°, mean ± SD). The RV free wall in the C￾TGA heart (Fig. 3, 3rd panel, right side) was similar but
with more dispersion in the outer layer, although a sug￾gestion of a crossing helical arrangement is noted, ran￾ging from − 52.9° to − 1.8° (− 22.4° ± 14.1°; mean ± SD) in
the epicardial layer and from − 70.0° to + 46.1°(− 19.5° ±
31.9°; mean ± SD) in the endocardial, trabecular layer
(Supp video 6).
LV in C-TGA
Interestingly, the LV in C-TGA (Fig. 3, 3rd panel, left
side) appears bilayered, with outer nearly circumferential
fibers (ranging from − 19.9° to − 2.6°; − 8.8° ± 4.8°,
mean ± SD) and an inner longitudinal layer more like
the normal RV (ranging from − 78.8° to − 4.5°; − 41.0° ±
20.3°, mean ± SD), as opposed to a normal LV. The LV
in the RVH ‘normal’ heart was structurally normal with
normal wall thickness and showed the typical crossing
helical pattern of the LV free wall (Fig. 3, bottom panel,
left side). The helix angle progresses smoothly from
about − 55.8° to − 2.9° (− 32.9° ± 14.0°, mean ± SD) at the
epicardial surface to about − 11.3° to + 54.4° (+ 18,7° ±
15,7°, mean ± SD) at the endocardial surface.
Small trabeculae vs large composite bundles
In the systemic RV, smaller muscle bundles are orga￾nized with parallel fibers (Fig. 4a, b). These are small
papillary muscles or free wall trabeculations measuring a
few mm to a cm or so. Some of these trabeculae and
papillary muscles fuse together to form larger (up to a
few cm), composite muscle bundles. In contrast to com￾ponent trabeculations, fiber orientation in larger, com￾posite bundles shows marked variability, largely between
component trabeculae (Fig. 4c, d, Supp videos 7), which
appears to account for the helix angle dispersion in the
inner, trabecular portion of the wall.
Apical whorl
The apical whorl of the RV is typically where circumfer￾ential epicardial fibers take a circular course around the
apex and then ingress to form longitudinal endocardial
fibers. Fibers ingressing superiorly tend to form longitu￾dinal septal fibers while those ingressing inferiorly form
free wall longitudinal fibers. The apical whorl of the
systemic RV is abnormal with chaotic arrangement of
fibers in some cases and an incomplete whorl in others
(Fig. 5, Supp video 8). The apex of the MA/AA heart has
no clear whorl, rather there is a meshwork of crossing
fibers and no organized ingression to form longitudinal
fibers. The apex of the DIRV heart has 2 partially
formed whorls and some fibers ingress to form longitu￾dinal fibers. The apex is left-sided in the C-TGA heart
and the whorl is partially formed but disorganized with
crossing fibers superiorly and inferiorly. In contrast, the
apical whorl of the hypertrophied RV is well-organized
and complete with normal ingression of epicardial fibers
to form endocardial longitudinal fibers (Fig. 5, Supp
video 8).
Whorls and vortices away from the apex
In addition, we observed myocardial whorls or vortices
in multiple areas away from the ventricular apex in the
systemic RV (Fig. 6,). Most appeared to be in a single
plane and could be seen in the tensor field images.
Others were more complex and could only be seen in
3D tractograms (Supp video 9).
Scalar parameters
Global cFA (Table 2) was significantly lower in structur￾ally abnormal hearts (MA/AA, DIRV, C-TGA) compared
to the structurally normal heart with RV hypertrophy
(RVH ‘normal’). It was also lower in the right-sided wall
of the 2 univentricular hearts (MA/AA, DIRV) compared
to the contralateral wall. cMD (Table 3) was significantly
higher in the DIRV and C-TGA hearts compared to the
heart with acquired RV hypertrophy (RV ‘normal’) but
significantly lower in the MA/AA heart. cMD was also
lower in the right-sided wall of the DIRV heart but did
not differ significantly between the 2 sides of the MA/
AA heart. cMD was also lower in the right-sided wall of
the DIRV heart but did not differ significantly between
the 2 sides of the MA/AA heart.
Histology
Fiber orientation by diffusion imaging closely matched
histology (Fig. 7). Comparisons between histology and
tensor field images or tractograms are qualitative be￾cause the streamline in the tractograms and the glyphs
in the tensor field images represent 100 s or 1000s of
myocytes in bundles. Consequently a 1:1 quantitative
comparison is not possible.

Discussion
We report the diffusion imaging of the myocardium in
hearts with a systemic RV. As previously reported in
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [7], myocardial structural
abnormalities are present in the systemic RV and likely
result in inefficient contraction and ventricular
dysfunction, as was present in our patients. These findings
support our hypothesis that disordered myocardium con￾tributes to heart failure in patients with a systemic RV.
Although the epicardial fibers were approximately
circumferential as in the normal RV, there was much
greater dispersion of helix angle in the inner trabecular
Fig. 4 Myofibers in the systemic RV tend to be organized within individual, small trabeculae (*) and papillary muscles a few mm up to ~ a cm or
so in diameter. In contrast, larger muscle bundles (enclosed in white ellipses), which are composites of the small trabeculae (*) and measure up
to a few cms, appear disorganized with many crossing fibers. a – Parallel fiber tracts in small trabeculae (*) in the MA/AA heart. These small

layer. This layer comprises at least ½ of the ventricular
wall. Myofiber disarray in such a large portion of the
wall is very likely to result in dysfunction. cFA was sig￾nificantly lower in the systemic RV compared with the
RVH ‘normal’ RV indicating loss of structural integrity
of the myocardium. cMD was significantly higher in 2 of
these hearts compared to the RVH ‘normal’. This indicates
increased extracellular space consistent with myocardial
edema and/or fibrosis, both of which are associated with
ventricular dysfunction and risk of arrythmias.
It is unclear if the RV apical whorl plays the same role
as that of the LV, where it contributes to LV torsion, an
important component of wall motion. The apical whorl
was chaotic or incompletely formed in the systemic RV. If
it is important for ventricular function, this could be an￾other mechanism of dysfunction. Alternatively, the abnor￾mal whorl could be simply a manifestation of myofiber
disarray. Further, the myocardial whorls seen in the myo￾cardium away from the apex could be the substrate of
arrhythmia, another frequent complication of palliation of
a systemic RV. Our findings support further studies of
myocardial architecture in congenital heart defects.
In the longer term, in vivo diffusion imaging [17, 18]
may be a groundbreaking tool for evaluating the suitabil￾ity and for risk stratifying candidates for complex surgi￾cal treatment of congenital heart defects. The principal
impediment to clinical use of diffusion imaging in the
heart is motion created by the cardiac and respiratory
cycles. The pulse gradient spin echo (PGSE) sequence
used for ex vivo imaging is unsuitable for in vivo diffu￾sion imaging because of its intrinsic susceptibility to
motion-induced artifact. Consequently, other approaches
have been employed. The most common sequence used
to date for clinical imaging is the stimulated echo acqui￾sition mode (STEAM). This approach can be imple￾mented on standard imaging equipment without the
need for high magnetic gradients. However, encoding
occurs over two consecutive heart beats, during which
the heart must be in the same location. This requires
careful respiratory gating. Most reports have been in
healthy, motivated subjects who were able to breath￾Fig. 5 The apical whorl of the systemic RV is replaced by an
incomplete whorl or even a chaotic net of fibers (Supp video 8). a –

the septum and free wall, respectively

hold or follow a visual feedback system to carefully con￾trol breathing. Both the requirements for two heart beats
and for tight respiratory gating resulting in long imaging
times make this approach not feasible for ill patients
with little respiratory control and frequent arrhythmias.
Another approach uses a spin echo sequence with high
magnetic gradient strength to minimize the duration of
diffusion encoding gradients relative to cardiac action
thus limiting or abolishing motion-induced artifact. Un￾like STEAM, this is carried out in a single heartbeat.
Post-processing using principal component analysis to
remove noise is followed by temporal maximum inten￾sity projection to recover signal intensity lost to motion.
Another spin-echo approach compensates for myocar￾dial motion using myocardial strain analysis over the
cardiac cycle (motion compensated spin-echo) [19]. Al￾though this method appears to have advantages at high
performance magnetic gradients, it does not appear to
perform as well as STEAM at usual, clinical magnetic
field gradients [19]. Despite significant progress to clinic￾ally useful cardiac DW CMR, substantial challenges re￾main, especially for ill patients with limited respiratory
control and arrhythmia.
Our patients were 5, 14, and 19 years old at transplant￾ation. Consequently, from our data it is impossible to de￾termine if the abnormal myocardial architecture is an
intrinsic feature of the systemic RV or if this is acquired
from long-standing hemodynamic abnormalities. The
organization of the RV wall with an inner trabecular layer
and an outer circumferential layer is reminiscent of the
organization of a normal RV [16, 20] suggesting that the
Fig. 6 Vortexes of fiber bundles (white circles) are observed within
the ventricular walls and trabeculations of the systemic RV, especially
at the base of papillary muscles and large muscle bundles. Some are
evident in planar tensor field images (a – MA/AA, b – DIRV, c – C￾TGA). Others are more complex and are visible only in 3D
tractograms (Supp video 9). We speculate that these could be a
substrate for reentry arrhythmias

myofiber disorganization is at least partly secondary to
hypertrophy and chamber dilatation. However, an experi￾mental study of induced RV hypertrophy (banding the
pulmonary trunk of young swine to induce hypertrophy
followed by DW CMR analysis of myoarchitecture) [16]
and our case of postnatally acquired RV hypertrophy
failed to demonstrate abnormal RV myoarchitecture. Per￾haps the abnormal hemodynamics in utero, when
myoarchitecture is developing, play an important role in
this process. Mekkaoui et al. [21] examined the develop￾ment of myofiber patterning in a series of human fetal
hearts. Although they did not look specifically at the RV,
the time course of patterning is likely to be similar to the
LV. At 10 weeks of gestation, just after the completion of
embryogenesis, myocytes are relatively isotropic so that a
clear DW signal was difficult to obtain. The process of
myofiber organization begins to develop between 14 and
19 weeks of gestation and continues even after birth.

Examination of abnormal fetal and neonatal hearts will
help to resolve these questions.
Our findings could have important implications for
embryogenesis of these congenital defects. The differing
patterns seen in the 2 sides of the systemic RV in the 2
hearts without a recognizable LV could be a clue to em￾bryonic development, with varying sources of cells and
developmental programs for the 2 sides of the heart even
in these hearts with apparently only one ventricle.
Quantitative analysis showed reduced cFA in structur￾ally abnormal hearts compared to a structurally normal
heart with postnatal RV hypertrophy. These findings are
consistent with what has been described for other car￾diac diseases (ischemic or non-ischemic), in which loss
of fiber orientation, fibrosis and disarray lead to a reduc￾tion of FA [4, 22]. Differences in cMD were less consist￾ent, with cMD being higher in the DIRV and C-TGA
hearts but lower in the MA/AA heart compared to the
RVH ‘normal’ heart. Although further studies are needed
to explain these phenomena, the differences in scalar pa￾rameters between structurally normal and abnormal
hearts and between the 2 ventricles or the 2 sides of the
univentricular hearts appears to result from microstruc￾ture alterations [22] and correspond to the abnormal
organization described by fiber tracking. While cFA
seems to be more correlated with the variance in fiber
orientation, it is not clear whether cMD values could be
influenced by the degree of edema which could be
present in such hearts.
The only previous report of diffusion imaging in a sys￾temic RV of which we are aware was in a living adult pa￾tient with transposition of the great arteries and an atrial
switch operation [23]. Helix angle measurements were
not specifically reported but the 3D reconstructions ap￾pear to show an external roughly circumferential layer
and an inner layer with more dispersion, similar to our
findings. Recently, the myocardial architecture in a sin￾gle fetal heart at 20 weeks gestation with a complex
heart defect including a systemic RV was evaluated using
high-resolution x-ray phase contrast computed tomog￾raphy [24]. In that heart the RV wall had a thin external
circumferential layer and a thicker, internal trabecular
layer with dispersion of the helix angle, similar to what
we observed in older patients with failing hearts. This
suggests that at least part of the myoarchitectural dis￾array that we have reported here is present in utero and
is likely due to abnormal development.
Limitations
First, our study is based on a very small number of cases.
This reflects the limited availability of such hearts for
study and is only an initial exploration of these abnormal
hearts. Second, although the resolution of our DW CMR
exams was higher than most reported studies in human
hearts, each glyph or fiber tract represents hundreds or
thousands of myofibers. Consequently, our data reflect the
orientation of aggregate myocardial diffusion streamlines
and not individual myofibers. Given the organization of
the myocardium in these hearts into trabeculae, the flow
streams that we describe appear to reflect the level of
myocardial organization likely to be important for ven￾tricular function. Third, we had no control over the phase
of the cardiac cycle in which the heart arrested. We fixed
the hearts mildly distended to standardize the conditions
as much as possible. Finally, the heart with RV hyper￾trophy and no structural heart defect was from a signifi￾cantly younger child than the other hearts. However, it
represents the effects of postnatal hypertrophy on myofi￾ber organization.
Conclusions
Our work shows for the first time that the failing sys￾temic RV in congenital heart disease is abnormally
structured and, although it is not clear yet whether these
alterations are genetically or hemodynamically deter￾mined, they could be the substrate for heart failure and
arrhythmias affecting these patients.
