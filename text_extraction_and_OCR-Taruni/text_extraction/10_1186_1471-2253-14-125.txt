Abstract
Background: In the field of anesthesia for bariatric surgery, a wide variety of recommendations exist, but a general
consensus on the perioperative management of such patients is missing. We outline the perioperative experiences
that we gained in the first two years after introducing a bariatric program.
Methods: The perioperative approach was established together with all relevant disciplines. Pertinent topics for the
anesthesiologists were; successful airway management, indications for more invasive monitoring, and the planning
of the postoperative period and deposition. This retrospective analysis was approved by the local ethics committee.
Data are mean [SD].
Results: 182 bariatric surgical procedures were performed (147 gastric bypass procedures (GBP; 146 (99.3%)
performed laparascopically). GBP patients were 43 [10] years old, 78% female, BMI 45 [7] kg/m2
, 73% ASA physical
status of 2. 42 patients (28.6%) presented with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. 117 GBP (79.6%) patients were
intubated conventionally by direct laryngoscopy (one converted to fiber-optic intubation, one aspiration of gastric
contents). 32 patients (21.8%) required an arterial line, 10 patients (6.8%) a central venous line. Induction lasted 25
[16] min, the procedure itself 138 [42] min. No blood products were required. Two patients (1.4%) presented with
hypothermia (<35°C) at the end of their case. The emergence period lasted 17 [9] min. Postoperatively, 32 patients
(21.8%) were transferred to the ICU (one ventilated). The other patients spent 4.1 [0.7] h in the post anesthesia care
unit. 15 patients (10.2%) required take backs for surgical revision (two laparotomies).
Conclusions: The physiology and anatomy of bariatric patients demand a tailored approach from both the
anesthesiologist and the perioperative team. The interaction of a multi-disciplinary team is key to achieving good
outcomes and a low rate of complications.

Background
Obesity represents a significant and growing problem
around the globe [1]. Aside from the impairment of an
individual patient, the negative consequences impose
a significant economic burden for many health care
systems [2].
For over a decade, bariatric surgical procedures have
established themselves as a way to achieve a permanent
weight reduction for a large number of patients [3].
This patient population represents a particular chal￾lenge for the anesthetist, with multiple publications
offering a wide range of recommendations on the mat￾ter [4-8]. Additionally, there are also large differences
in terms of the data that outline the perioperative
process times [9-12]. All of this results in difficulty to
establish such a program and predict its trajectory at
the early stages. * Correspondence: alexander.dullenkopf@stgag.ch 1

We report the perioperative experience two years after
the start of such a bariatric program at our single Swiss
institution.
Methods
In early 2011 a multidisciplinary obesity program was
launched at the Kantonsspital Frauenfeld (KSF) (General
Hospital Level 2, 270 beds, about 8400 anesthetics per
year). The program encompassed bariatric surgical care,
psychiatric/psychosomatic patient guidance, nutrition
counselling, gastro-enterological and cardiac work-up, as
well as the follow-up and physical therapy.
Anesthesia and intensive care medicine physicians
were involved early in the planning process. In collabor￾ation with the surgical team, a perioperative approach for
patient care was developed for each individual patient.
From an anesthesia perspective, the key points of this
concept were the characterization of preoperative testing
including laboratory tests. A detailed cardiac evaluation
was obtained for all patients that were either over 55 years,
had a BMI >50 kg/m2
, an exercise tolerance of <4 MET
or any significant cardiac history. An evaluation by a
pulmonologist including lung function testing and
screening for obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) were per￾formed for all patients, if not previously diagnosed.
The anesthetist in the preoperative clinic saw the
patients about two weeks preoperatively or on the day
before surgery. The main focus was on the detection of
any form of OSA and its pre-existing treatment. All
patients were informed and consented about the possi￾bilies of an awake fiber-optic intubation, an arterial
line (AL), a central venous catheter (CVC) and a post￾operative stay in the intensive care unit (ICU).
The nil per os (NPO) time for all patients was six
hours fasting for solid food, and two hours for clear liq￾uids. Midazolam 7.5 mg po was given preoperatively, un￾less the patient had a BMI >40 kg/m2
, or was diagnosed
with OSA, in order to minimize the risk of perioperative
hypoventilation. Patients were instructed to take their
baseline medication with the exception of ACE inhibi￾tors or AT-II antagonists. In patients with a history of
gastro-esophageal reflux, a therapy with proton pump
inhibitors (PPI) was initiated if not already in place.
For the anesthetic induction, peripheral venous access
was established. When non-invasive blood pressure mea￾surements were reliably feasible, no AL was placed. The
choice of the individual airway management technique
(conventional direct laryngoscopy vs fiber-optic intubation
either awake, as a rapid sequence induction or asleep) was
at the discretion of the assigned anesthesia attending.
All conventional intubations were performed in Anti￾Trendelenburg position in order to reduce the risk of regur￾gitation and aspiration of gastric contents. Preoxygenation
was performed with the patient breathing spontaneously
via face mask (FiO2 = 1.0) until the end-expiratory FiO2
was at least 0.8. Propofol was used for induction,
followed by BIS monitoring guided Propofol infusion
and/ or Sevoflurane for anesthesia maintenance, supple￾mented with Fentanyl and Remifentanil. Propofol was
dosed as target controlled infusion (TCI) with a range
of 2.2 to 4 mcg/ml and was supplemented by Sevoflur￾ane, as needed. Sevoflurane was used when the Propofol
infusion resulted in hypotension and had to be reduced
to below 2.2 mcg/ml or when despite a Propofol TCI of
4 mcg/ml the anesthetic depth was insufficient, as indi￾cated by the BIS monitoring.
Cefazolin, 1.5 g IV served as the antibiotic prophylaxis.
Paralysis for intubation was achieved with either Suc￾cinylcholine or Atracurium,. Atracurium was the para￾lytic of choice for subsequent paralysis. After intubation
a second large bore peripheral IV catheter (≥17G) was
placed. In cases where peripheral vascular access was
difficult, a CVC was inserted. For the surgical procedure,
the patient was positioned in a modified, semi-standing
beach chair position. In order to prevent deep venous
thrombosis, sequential compression devices were applied
intraoperatively, followed by low molecular weight heparin
sc on the first postoperative evening as prescribed by
the surgeon, in combination with early mobilization of the
patients. An inspiratory oxygen fraction (FiO2) of 0.6 and
a positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cm H2O
were the standard initial ventilator settings, while using
either pressure controlled or volume controlled ventilation
(target for Pmax ≤30 cm H2O, and tidal volume 6 ml/kg).
Paralysis at the end of the procedure was checked with
quantitative TOF-determination (TOF-Watch; Organon,
Dublin, Ireland). If the TOF-ratio was less than 0.9, Glyco￾pyrrolate combined with Neostigmine was used to reverse
the neuromuscular blockade. Postoperative nausea and
vomiting (PONV) was pre-emptively treated according to
an escalating protocol based on the Apfel risk score [13].
In order to be extubated after the procedure, a patient’s
body temperature had to be 35.0°C or higher. The emer￾gence and extubation were performed in a separate dedi￾cated room. The multimodal postoperative pain regime
was initiated 20 min before end of surgery with a combin￾ation of 5 mg of morphine iv, paracetamol IV 4 × 1 g/d,
metamizole IV 5 g/24 h, controlled-release oxycodone
and naloxone (Targin®) po 2 × 10/5 mg, and morphine
IV 2 – 5 mg as rescue medication. Non-steroidal anti￾inflammatory drugs were omitted, and patients were
kept NPO for the first postoperative night, except for
the mentioned Targin®.
Elective patients with an uneventful surgical and
anesthetic course were recovered in the post anesthesia
care unit (PACU). Patients with OSA and no continuous
positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy were admitted to
the ICU postoperatively to provide continuous monitoring

for the first post-operative night. Pre-existing CPAP ther￾apy was continued after extubation, using the patient’s
usual setup and adjusting the settings as clinically needed
in the PACU.
The institutional ethics committee of the Canton of
Thurgau, Switzerland, approved the retrospective ana￾lysis of the anesthesia documents and medical records of
all patients undergoing bariatric surgery in the first two
years after the establishment of the new bariatric program
at the Kantonsspital Frauenfeld (KEKTG/PEB2013/09).
The study was registered with the German registry for
clinical studies (www.drks.de; DRKS00005437). Essential
anesthesia and perioperative data and complications were
collected and investigated.
The surgical procedures of the patients in the bariatric
program were quite heterogeneous. Therefore we mainly
investigated the data of patients undergoing a gastric
bypass procedure (GBP). We did not include any follow￾up interventions of cosmetic nature.
The data are presented descriptively as mean [standard
deviation].
Results
During the two year observation period (2011–2013), after
initiating the bariatric program, a total of 182 bariatric
operations were performed, 178 of them laparascopically.
Patients had a mean age of 44 [10] years, were pre￾dominantly female (79.7%), with a BMI of 43 [8] kg/m2
.
The surgical procedures were quite heterogeneous and
had operation times of 30 min for a laparoscopic re￾moval of a gastric band up to 425 min for a laparotomy
for a complex revision case (mean 130 [51] minutes).
Because of that heterogeneity, we decided to only include
patients that underwent gastric bypass procedures (GBP) in
the further analysis. The total number of GBP was 147, all
but one of them were performed laparascopically. 19 cases
(12.9%) needed an additional procedure at the same time
(18 removal of a gastric band, 1 cholecystectomy).
Table 1 shows the demographic data of the GBP patients.
All patients underwent thorough preoperative evalua￾tions. 107 patients (72.8%) were classified with an ASA
physical status of 2, 39 (26.5%) with ASA 3 and 1 patient
(0.7%) with ASA 4. 67 patients (45.6%) presented with
arterial hypertension, 42 patients (28.6%) with OSA (29
(69.0%) of them with CPAP therapy), 33 patients (22.4%)
had (mostly non-insulin dependent) diabetes mellitus, 81
(55.1%) had gastro-esophageal reflux disease, 68 patients
(46.3%) were smokers, with a mean of 24 [20] pack years.
92 patients (62.6%) reported no regular medication.
In 101 patients a chest X-ray was performed as part of
their preoperative work up. This resulted in 13 patients
(12.8% of studies) demonstrating pathologic findings,
mostly in the form of either atelectasis or left ventricular
enlargement. In 143 patients a preoperative ECG was
obtained, it showed abnormal findings in 26 patients
(18.2%), 4 of them had a prolonged QTc interval. Forty￾nine patients received a preoperative echocardiography;
this resulted in 21 patients (42.9%) with a pathological
result. Two patients presented with a moderate valvulo￾pathy, one patient had a severely impaired LVEF of 25%.
A stress test was performed in 96 patients, and resulted
in 24 patients (25%) with abnormalities, 2 patients had
clear signs of ischemia during exercise. Preoperative
gastroscopy (137 patients) was pathological in 91 patients
(66.4%) (e.g. axial hiatal hernia, GERD). The other pre￾operative investigations revealed abnormal findings in 74
patients (50.3%), the majority of them were found during
the abdominal ultrasound. The majority of patients (142,
96.6% of gastric bypass patients) were admitted to the
hospital at least one day prior the surgery.
In 115 patients (78.2%) the non-invasive blood pressure
measurement was considered sufficient, in 32 patients
(21.8%) an AL was placed for blood pressure measure￾ment. A second large bore peripheral IV was placed in
137 patients (93.2%), 10 patients (6.8%) received a
central venous catheter (CVC).
Twenty-nine patients (19.7%) were intubated fiber￾optically, 26 of them awake, 3 patients after induction of
general anesthesia. One of them was a difficult intub￾ation (required 3 attempts). 117 patients (79.6%) were
intubated with direct laryngoscopy, 103 of them with a
rapid sequence induction. In 87.4% of the conventional
intubation cases, patients presented with a Cormack￾Lehane grade 1, 8.1% had a grade 2, 4.5% a grade 3 and in
one case (0.9%) the airway had to be secured unplanned
with the fiber-optic. One patient (0.7%) experienced an
episode of aspiration of gastric contents that remained
without consequences.
In 146 patients (99.3%) anesthesia was induced with
Propofol and 145 patients (98.6%) received a Propofol

infusion (2 [0.7] g) as main anesthetic for the case. Pain
management was achieved with fentanyl (0.6 [0.2] mg)
and remifentanil (2.0 [0.4] mg). 26 of the patients (17.9%)
also received a supplementation of their anesthetic with
Sevoflurane. In 2 patients (1.4%) the anesthesia was main￾tained with Sevoflurane only. Fluid homeostasis was
achieved with 1700 [600] ml of Ringerfundin (B. Braun
Medical, Sempach, Switzerland), and 400 [300] ml of HES
130/04 (Voluven; Fresenius Kabi, Oberdorf, Switzerland).
In 59 cases (40.1%) the patient’s blood pressure had to
be supported pharmacologically, mainly due to the
beach chair positioning of the patients. 52 times boluses
of Ephedrine were used and in 7 cases Norepinephrine
was given in boluses. One patient (0.7%) received Atropine
to counteract a relevant bradycardia. In 24 cases (16.3%) it
was necessary to medically address hypertension. This was
done using Clonidine in 21 instances, and for 3 patients
Urapidil was the medication of choice.
In 63 patients (42.9%) an intra-operative PEEP in ex￾cess of 5 cm H2O was required (maximum 11 cm H2O).
The perioperative process times are shown in Table 2.
No blood products had to be administered for any
case. Four patients (2.7%) required a blood transfusion
in the subsequent course of their hospital stay.
At the end of procedure 116 patients (78.9%) needed
reversal of their paralysis. The core body temperature
was 36 [0.5] °C. Two patients (1.4%) could not be main￾tained above 35°C during the procedure, one of these
patients was transferred to the intensive care where he
was extubated one hour later. All extubations were un￾problematic, no patient had to be re-intubated.
Postoperatively 115 patients (78.2%) were transferred
to the post anesthesia care unit to recover from the pro￾cedure, 32 patients (21.8%) were transferred to the ICU. 15
of those admissions (10.2% of all gastric bypass patients)
were planned preoperatively due to untreated OSA. None
of these patients needed anything other than supplemental
application of nasal oxygen. The reasons for unplanned
ICU admission was hemodynamic instability in 6 patients,
insufficient oxygenation in one patient, hypothermia in
another patient (<35°C). The average length of stay in
the post anesthesia care unit was 4.1 [0.7] hours, patients
that went to the ICU remained there for 17 [12] hours.
During the observation period 15 (10.2%) of the gastric
bypass patients required additional surgery (4 major
operations), two (1.4%) of them were laparotomies. Eight
patients (5.4%) needed surgical revision of some form of
an incisional or internal hernia. Three patients (2.0%) pre￾sented with some form of postoperative hemorrhage that
required the transfusion of blood products, 2 patients
(1.4%) developed pneumonia, and one of them required
non-invasive ventilation. There was zero in-hospital mor￾tality. The average length of hospital stay was 6 [2] days.
Discussion
This publication reflects on the perioperative and anesthetic
experience two years after starting a bariatric program.
Retrospectively, the patient’s medical charts and anesthesia
records were analyzed with emphasis on the bariatric
surgery and any follow up procedures. All the essential
process times and metrics were collected to create
insight into the effects of implementing a surgical bar￾iatric program from an anesthesia standpoint.
Our main finding was that the bariatric patient popula￾tion presents with its unique challenges. When managed
appropriately in an interdisciplinary fashion, anesthesia
can be delivered safely to this patient population. The pre￾operative evaluation of these patients should be conducted
based on an individual’s need rather than relying on stan￾dardized test batteries.
Anesthesia for morbidly obese patients is generally
regarded as being associated with increased risks [8,14].
Accordingly, there are various contributions on the
anesthetic and perioperative management in this patient
group [4-7,15]. They include the preoperative assess￾ment, especially with regards to the airway management
and monitoring strategies, the intra-operative phase, the
emergence from anesthesia and the postoperative phase.
Since bariatric surgery is being used in a more wide￾spread manner, caring for morbidly obese patients is
becoming more common for many institutions [3]. The
surgical procedures are well illustrated by Ogunnaike
et al. [6], e.g.
General
When dealing with the anesthetic considerations for bar￾iatric surgery, it quickly becomes clear that it takes more
than good surgeons and anesthetists to have a successful
program. The patients need involvement of additional
specialists such as Internal Medicine, Psychiatry, Physical

Therapy etc. [3]. In addition, emphasis has to be put on
the follow up care since a significant proportion of the
patients will require additional surgical interventions.
This affected 10% of our patients after gastric bypass
surgery. Not included in this number were cosmetic
follow-up operations such as abdominoplasty after the
weight loss. Possible complications such as anastomotic
leakage or internal hernia that require urgent care have
to be considered when setting up the infrastructure.
Preoperative evaluation
Ideally, the extent of the preoperative diagnostics are
tailored for each patient [7,10,15-17]. Heinrich et al.
[10] reported, that approximately 20% of their patients
received preoperative pulmonary function tests, which
in return showed pathological values in over 90% of the
cases. Such a streamlined approach is not always feas￾ible, resulting in more generous recommendations for
preoperative testing [4,6]. Overall, the reported inci￾dences of comorbidities such as hypertension or dia￾betes mellitus are lower than maybe expected [9,12].
Great emphasis is generally put on the preoperative
detection of an obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome,
which mainly results in consequences for the postopera￾tive phase, but also can influence the course before the
surgery [7]. There seems to be a general consensus on
the evaluation of the intubation anatomy, but no uni￾form approach exists [7,18].
In our cohort, the vast majority of patients presented
with an ASA physical status of 2. Arterial hypertension,
diabetes mellitus and other overweight associated comor￾bidities were relatively often encountered. At the same
time they barely ever influenced the perioperative
approach. In collaboration with the Cardiology depart￾ment of our hospital we have defined a pathway for the
subset of patients that need to be seen by a cardiologist
preoperatively. As a result we had only 40% of the per￾formed echocardiograms and 25% of the stress tests
with pathological findings. These results were instru￾mental to evaluate the general risk, determine the need
for intraoperative monitoring, and to clarify the neces￾sity of postoperative observation in the intensive care
unit. No preoperative test results were so severe or
unexpected that the surgical procedure had to be can￾celled. Preoperative examinations such as gastroscopy
or abdominal ultrasonography were used to plan the
surgical procedure and did not affect the anesthetic
approach.
Anesthetic
A key factor for the perioperative course of those pa￾tients was the duration of anesthesia, which in return
consists mostly of the duration of surgery and the
expertise of the surgeon [19]. Various authors report
very different times for gastric bypass surgery; a median of
241 min for Leykin [12], 160 min for Heinrich et al. [10],
120 min in a review by Shang and Beck [15], and a quick
40 min for Jacobsen et al., and Bergland et al. in a dedi￾cated center in Oslo, Norway [9,11]. The group around
Jacobsen [11] additionally showed that the duration of the
emergence from anesthesia could be substantially reduced
as a result from standardization of the surgical procedure
that also produced reliable waypoints for the anesthetist.
In our cohort, we note a wide distribution of the times
for anesthesia induction and emergence. This fact should
be given additional consideration when coordinating the
operating room resources.
The intraoperative monitoring of patients undergoing
GBP is very heterogeneous. In many institutions the
insertion of an arterial cannula for blood pressure
measurement is standard [5] or at least generously ap￾plied [7,10,15]. A similar approach to the liberal usage
of central venous access seems also typical [10]. At the
same time there are also data from large bariatric cen￾ters in which invasive monitoring is largely avoided [9].
In our series, the non-invasive blood pressure measure￾ment was clinically judged to be reliable in 80% of
patients. Also, in 94% of the cases, 2 adequate periph￾eral venous catheters were successfully inserted.
During induction of anesthesia the main focus was
on the airway management. The importance of proper
patient positioning and pre-oxygenation is well de￾scribed [7]. Depending on the training background, the
fiber-optic intubation in the awake patient has a high
significance [4,12]. When patients are intubated with
conventional, direct laryngoscopy, they are reported to
either have roughly the same [9,18,20] or slightly more
difficult intubation condition than comparable cohorts
[5,10]. In our institution, the details of the airway
management were at the discretion of the attending
anesthesiologist. In one of our reference hospitals
(Kantonsspital St. Gallen, Switzerland, www.kssg.ch),
the fiber-optic intubation in the awake patient is strongly
propagated for patients with a BMI >35 kg/m2 which
partially explains the rather large share of almost 20% of
our patients being intubated in such fashion. The con￾ventional laryngoscopies resulted in 80% in complete
visibility of the glottis (Cormack-Lehane grade I). In one
patient the conventional intubation failed, highlighting
the need to define an appropriate contingency plan. In
all cases with conventional laryngoscopy we performed
mask ventilation after the induction of anesthesia. In
our rapid sequence protocol we set the inspiratory pres￾sure to a maximum of 15 cm H2O and ventilated the
patient’s lungs about 4 times per minute.
In most publications the anesthesia maintenance is de￾scribed as being accomplished with volatile anesthetics or
balanced anesthesia [10,11], but Propofol-based anesthesia
Lindauer et al. BMC Anesthesiology 2014, 14:125 Page 5 of 7
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2253/14/125

regimes are also mentioned [7,12]. In our patients we
almost exclusively used Propofol, which provided adequate
hemodynamic stability and a rapid and uncomplicated
emergence. Regarding our emergence times, it should be
noted that in our setting the extubation took place in a
dedicated area in the OR for the majority of cases. The rate
of intraoperative complications is described to be around
5%, of those roughly a fifth can be regarded as anesthesia￾related [14]. During the procedure the adequate oxygen￾ation of the patient is of main concern [7]. Recruitment
maneuvers and increased PEEP levels were described as
effective, but are not of great sustainability [21]. Ac￾cordingly, it was deemed necessary to increase the PEEP
level above the default setting of 5 cm H2O in 40% of
our patients.
No blood products had to be administered intraopera￾tively in any case. Due to the relative difficulty to access
the patients during the procedure we performed a type
and screen on all of them, so we would have blood
products readily available should the need arise. Be￾cause of the long duration of the procedure we put a
clear emphasis on the temperature management and
consequently only had two of our patients (1.4%) that
had to be extubated delayed due to hypothermia. The
emergence from anesthesia was generally unproblem￾atic, mostly due to the appropriate planning and con￾sistent avoidance of residual paralysis.
Postoperative care
The rate of postoperative ventilation requirement and
the surveillance in either a 24-hour post anesthesia
care unit or an intensive care unit varies considerably.
Nishiyama et al. [5] for example report over 25% patients
requiring postoperative ventilation in their case series,
Leykin [12] had a rate of about 4%. Heinrich et al. [10]
monitored over 50% of their gastric bypass patients for
more than 24 hours in a dedicated intermediate care unit
and had over 10% of the patients intubated during that
period. On the other hand, Jacobsen et al. [11] reported
that only 3 out of 2,000 patients required surveillance in
the intensive care unit over a period of 5 years, whereas
most patients only spent 2–4 h in the post anesthesia care
unit. In our setting, which is devoid of a step down unit,
a patient with untreated sleep apnoea syndrome was
considered to be an indication for postoperative admis￾sion to the ICU, in accordance to the ASA guidelines
for postoperative monitoring in OSA patients. This ex￾plains half (10% of all patients) of the ICU admissions.
However, no interventions regarding to the OSA were
necessary. The other 10% of the patients had varying
reasons for their stay in the ICU.
Pain management can be particularly challenging in
bariatric surgery patients. In our retrospective analysis
it was not possible to evaluate standardized data for
mobilization of patients or pain assessments. However,
it should be mentioned that in no patient an intervention
of our peri-operative pain service (e.g. regional anesthesia
or iv patient controlled analgesia) was necessary.
In general, the anesthetic literature on bariatric sur￾gery appears to be very heterogeneous. This is reflected
in the volume of reported operations performed in each
center, the characteristic process times and also in the
anesthetic management. However, some recommenda￾tions found in the literature seem rather laborious and
intricate.
The mid-term goals for our perioperative approach are
aiming towards a more formalized fast-track bariatric
surgery regime. This should be facilitated by a reduction
in the surgical times and enhanced interdisciplinary
collaboration with focus on the essentials [9,11]. Add￾itionally, the risk stratification of airway difficulties
should be more standardized and the extent of preopera￾tive testing re-considered. Providing muscle relaxation
with rocuronium together with its specific reversal with
sugammadex certainly has a potential place in this context
[22]. The outcomes of the proposed strategies with respect
to prophylaxis of PONV and pain management have to
be followed in more detail. Another interesting detail to
be investigated in the future is the possible difference in
perioperative risk in patients being “just obese” com￾pared to those being diagnosed as having metabolic
syndrome [23,24].
Conclusions
Bariatric anesthesia comes with its unique challenges,
but when approached in an thoughtful and interdiscip￾linary fashion it becomes safely manageable. In addition,
the need for some urgent follow-up operations and
appropriate postoperative monitoring capabilities have
to be accounted for at all times.
