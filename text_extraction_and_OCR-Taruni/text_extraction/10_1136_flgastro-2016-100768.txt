REVIEW
Management of chronic hepatitis B
before and after liver transplantation
B Wang, K Agarwal, D Joshi
ABSTRACT
Chronic hepatitis B infection is a global public
health problem associated with significant
morbidity and mortality. Persistent infection may
evolve to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular
carcinoma, and hepatitis B-related liver disease is
a common indication for liver transplantation.
Patients with advanced liver disease should be
treated with antiviral therapy which may result in
clinical improvement. The management of
patients after liver transplant then focuses on
preventing hepatitis B recurrence in the graft.
With the introduction of prophylactic treatment,
patient and graft survival has improved
significantly. In this review, we will discuss the
management of patients with hepatitis B-related
cirrhosis, both compensated and
decompensated. We also review the
management of hepatitis B after liver
transplantation.
INTRODUCTION
Chronic infection with hepatitis B virus
(HBV) affects an estimated 350–400
million people worldwide with prevalence
as high as 5%–10% of the adult popula￾tion in Sub-Saharan Africa and East Asia;
in Europe over 13 million people live
with HBV infection, a prevalence of
nearly 2%.1 Persistent chronic hepatitis B
may evolve to cirrhosis and hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC) and deaths attributed
to these complications are estimated at
780 000 per year.2 In patients with
HBV-related cirrhosis, the 5-year cumula￾tive incidence of hepatic decompensation
is around 20%. Without transplantation,
the 5-year survival of these decompen￾sated patients is 15%–35%.
Current management of chronic hepa￾titis B includes pharmacological agents
such as interferon and nucleos(t)ide ana￾logues (NA), as well as surveillance for
HCC and management of decompensa￾tion.3 Despite this however, liver
transplantation may still be necessary in
those patients who develop indications
with decompensated cirrhosis, acute
hepatic flare or HCC. Appropriate man￾agement of patients with HBV-related cir￾rhosis is therefore key in either
preventing progression to transplant, or
to ensuring optimisation going into trans￾plant. After liver transplantation, the
patient remains at risk of persistent HBV
infection and prevention of recurrent
infection in the graft is of utmost import￾ance in ensuring graft and patient sur￾vival. In this article, we aim to review the
management of chronic hepatitis B
before transplantation, in patients with
compensated and decompensated cirrho￾sis and also the management after liver
transplantation.
MANAGEMENT BEFORE LIVER
TRANSPLANTATION
Treatment in compensated cirrhosis
Patients with previously undiagnosed and
untreated hepatitis B infection presenting
with cirrhotic liver disease is not an
uncommon scenario. After confirmation
of cirrhosis on the basis of clinical, patho￾logical and radiological assessment, a sys￾tematic screen should be undertaken to
elicit the underlying cause. Patients iden￾tified as having chronic HBV infection
with hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)
positivity should be checked for cofactors
such as alcoholic or non-alcoholic fatty
liver disease and other viral co-infection.
Once the diagnosis of chronic hepatitis
B-related cirrhosis has been made, the
consensus is all of these patients should
be treated with antiviral therapy includ￾ing those with decompensation.3 4 This is
in contrast to patients presenting before
the development of cirrhosis where the
decision to treat is based on hepatitis B e
antigen status, alanine transaminase

derangement, HBV DNA level and the degree of liver
fibrosis either by histological assessment or by non￾invasive methods such as transient elastography.3
The rationale of commencing treatment in those
with compensated HBV-related cirrhosis is to prevent
further deterioration of liver function or progression
to decompensation, as well as reducing the risk of
development of HCC. Liaw et al,
5 in a landmark
randomised controlled trial of patients with biopsy￾proven advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis, compared
untreated patients with those treated with lamivudine
and showed significantly fewer events in the treat￾ment group such as deterioration in Child-Pugh
score, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, portal hyper￾tensive bleeding, development of HCC and death
related to liver disease. Further studies have consoli￾dated this and shown significantly improved long￾term survival in patients with cirrhosis with sustained
HBV DNA suppression on antiviral therapy.6
Furthermore, there is evidence that prolonged treat￾ment and viral suppression result in improvement
histologically with regression of advanced fibrosis and
even cirrhosis.7 8
The risk of developing HCC in patients with
HBV-related cirrhosis is estimated at 10%–17% cumula￾tively over 5 years.9 Risk factors can be divided into
host factors and virus factors. Host factors include male
sex, age and family history of HCC. The virus factors
include HBV genotype, co-infection and duration of
infection, but the most crucial remains HBV DNA
level. A direct relationship between persistent eleva￾tion of HBV DNA (>104 copies/mL) and risk of HCC
was demonstrated by the Risk Evaluation of Viral
load Elevation and Associated Liver disease/cancer –
Hepatitis B Virus (REVEAL-HBV) study group.10 11
Several studies and meta-analyses have gone on to dem￾onstrate that successful viral suppression with antiviral
therapy reduces the risk of HCC, particularly in patients
with cirrhosis.12 13 The risk is not eliminated however
and patients with cirrhosis on antiviral treatment should
continue to have surveillance for HCC.14
Treatment in decompensated cirrhosis and on transplant
wait list
Good evidence exists for treating patients with
decompensated cirrhosis with antiviral therapy, with
both short-term and long-term survival benefits.15 16
A recent large prospective study looked at outcomes
in over 700 patients with decompensated HBV-related
cirrhosis, of whom over 400 were treated with anti￾viral therapy in the form of various NA.17 This study
demonstrated that antiviral treatment was associated
with improved hepatic function (reflected as improve￾ment in Child-Pugh and Model for End-stage Liver
Disease (MELD) scores) and transplant-free survival.
The study also showed long-term benefit in survival
and improvement in liver function with a protracted
follow-up period of >5 years. An earlier study in
2002 similarly demonstrated improved clinical and
laboratory parameters compared with baseline in 154
patients with decompensated chronic hepatitis B
treated with lamivudine for a median of 16 months.18
In both studies, a cohort of patients died in the first
6 months of follow-up despite antiviral therapy
(13.4%17 and 16.2%18). It therefore suggests that
some patients with very advanced disease cannot be
salvaged with antiviral therapy and therefore would
benefit from early assessment for liver transplantation.
In the earlier study, predictors of 6-month mortality
were found to be higher pretreatment serum bilirubin
and creatinine, and detectable HBV DNA level at
baseline. In practice, such patients should potentially
undergo liver transplant assessment alongside com￾mencing antiviral therapy. Clinical improvement with
antiviral treatment on the wait list would then result
in delisting.
In those patients for whom liver transplantation
becomes necessary, viral suppression ideally to
undetectable levels remains important in preventing
HBV recurrence in the graft. Studies have shown a
direct correlation between viral load at time of trans￾plant and rate of recurrence.19 This, in conjunction
with post-transplant prophylaxis, which will be dis￾cussed later in this review, has resulted in HBV recur￾rence rates falling from 70% to 100% to <10%.20
Therapeutic options
The drugs currently approved for the treatment of
chronic HBV include pegylated-interferon and five
NA: lamivudine, adefovir dipivoxil, entecavir, telbivu￾dine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF).
Interferon is not recommended in the treatment of
patients with advanced cirrhosis given the increased
risk of infection and hepatic decompensation.3 Of the
NA, lamivudine has the longest history of evidence as
the first oral agent. Early studies demonstrating the
benefit of treating patients with cirrhosis with antiviral
therapy used lamivudine and the same principles can
be applied to other NA. However, with the develop￾ment of newer NA, lamivudine is no longer recom￾mended as first-line therapy because of its high rate of
resistance over long-term use and its inferiority in
terms of antiviral potency.3 21 Viral breakthrough due
to drug resistance can result in acute hepatic flare,
which in patients with cirrhosis may potentially result
in decompensation or even a more fulminant picture
of hepatic failure. Entecavir and TDF are now the pre￾ferred first-line agents, with large systematic reviews
demonstrating their efficacy in patients with both
compensated and decompensated cirrhosis.16 22 Both
drugs are potent suppressors of HBV DNA with low
rates of resistance; around 1% over 5 years of treat￾ment for entecavir,23 and no reported resistance in
long-term follow-up studies of TDF.8 24
The safety of drugs used in patients with cirrhosis is
also a key issue as they lack hepatic reserve and may

have co-existing problems such as renal impairment,
which mean any adverse effects may be more detri￾mental. The safety of both entecavir and TDF has
been evaluated in large randomised multicentre trials,
which show no greater adverse events when compared
with each other and with other older NA such as ade￾fovir.25 26 Nonetheless, there are theoretical concerns
with both entecavir and TDF which require aware￾ness. An association between entecavir and lactic acid￾osis has been suggested, with one report in which 5
out of 16 patients with decompensated cirrhosis
developed severe lactic acidosis after starting entecavir
treatment.27 TDF has been associated with reduced
bone mineral density as well as with renal disease,
from an asymptomatic rise in serum creatinine
through to severe renal tubular disease manifest as
Fanconi’s syndrome.28
Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) is a new drug which
has been introduced as a potentially safer NA in long￾term use. It is a prodrug to tenofovir which results in
higher intracellular concentrations of the active metab￾olite, with lower circulating plasma levels which are
associated with the aforementioned renal and bone
toxicity.29 Two recent large phase III trials have
demonstrated non-inferiority of TAF compared with
TDF in terms of HBV DNA suppression at 48 weeks,
as well as improved safety profile with respect to bone
mineral density.30 31 These studies did not include
patients with advanced liver disease (Childs-Pugh B or
above) or decompensated cirrhosis; studies including
these cohorts, as well as longer follow-up data, are
planned.
MANAGEMENT AFTER LIVER TRANSPLANTATION
Recurrence of HBV infection after liver transplant￾ation, defined as the reappearance of circulating
HBsAg with or without detectable HBV DNA, is
almost universal without appropriate management.
Prior to the use of prophylaxis against HBV recur￾rence, graft and patient survival were so poor that
HBV-related liver disease was considered a relative if
not absolute contraindication to transplantation.32
Passive prophylaxis with hepatitis B immunoglobulin
(HBIG) reduced recurrence rates from 75% to 36%,
with improved graft and patient survival.33 After the
development of oral NA antivirals, the options for
prophylactic treatment have expanded.
HBIG monotherapy
The early studies with HBIG monotherapy used an
intravenous dose intra-operatively during the anhepa￾tic phase followed by daily dosing then subsequent
monthly dosing aiming to maintain anti-HB titres of
>500 IU/L.34 35 Although short-term results were
good, the need for indefinite therapy resulted in pro￾blems with local and systemic side effects, high costs
and the development of HBIG-resistant mutants,
which made it a poor long-term option.36
NA monotherapy
Early studies showed lamivudine and adefovir to be
effective monotherapy in reducing HBV recurrence
post-transplant.37 38 However, as in the pretransplant
setting, their long-term use is limited by high rates of
resistance. More recently, entecavir monotherapy has
been used with one study showing 77.5% of patients
remained HBsAg negative 2 years after transplant.39
In this study, only 26% of patients were HBV DNA
negative at the time of transplant. The same group
went on to expand on this work by reviewing over
300 patients treated without HBIG prophylaxis, using
NAs as monotherapy or in combination (predomin￾antly lamivudine and adefovir).40 After 3 years, HBV
recurrence rates ranged from 0% to 17% with 8-year
patient survival at 83%. These results are promising,
suggesting a role for limiting HBIG use and reducing
financial costs.
Combination therapy
Combination therapy with HBIG and an NA has a
large body of evidence, and is currently the recom￾mended treatment regimen.3 Several large
meta-analyses have demonstrated the efficacy of com￾bination therapy, including reduced HBV-related mor￾tality compared with HBIG alone.36 41–43 More
recently, there has been data showing even lower rates
of recurrence using HBIG with a potent NA. An ana￾lysis including 11 trials (304 patients) of HBIG with
either tenofovir or entecavir showed an overall 1%
recurrence rate.44 The specific HBIG regimen used in
combination varies between centres but typically con￾sists of an intravenous dose, usually 5000–10 000 IU,
in the anhepatic phase and then immediately post￾transplant, for example, 5000 IU/day on alternate days
for 1 week (figure 1). This is followed by intermittent
low doses either at fixed intervals (monthly) or in a
frequency dictated by hepatitis B surface antibody
levels (usually to maintain levels >50–100 IU/L).45
Alternative routes of HBIG administration such as
intramuscular or subcutaneous low doses are accepted
strategies to reduce cost and adverse effects.46 47
Given the expense of long-term administration of
HBIG, there has been recent interest in HBIG-free
prophylaxis, with combination therapy for the imme￾diate post-transplant period only and subsequent
HBIG withdrawal. Single-centre studies have shown
this to be safe and efficacious in patients at low risk of
HBV recurrence. One group selected 47 patients
treated with combination therapy who were consid￾ered low risk (mainly those with undetectable HBV
DNA at transplant), to stop HBIG after 12 months.
After HBIG discontinuation, patients were treated
either with lamivudine plus adefovir or tenofovir, or
tenofovir or entecavir monotherapy; 6.3% of patients
developed HBsAg recurrence after a median follow-up
of 24 months.48 Similarly, another group demon￾strated 8.6% recurrence 22 months after HBIG

discontinuation in 58 patients treated with either
tenofovir or entecavir after withdrawal.49
HBIG withdrawal, although potentially safe and
efficacious, is only appropriate in selected patients.
HBV DNA level at the time of transplant is the most
important predictor of risk of recurrence and HBIG
withdrawal should not be considered in those who are
HBV DNA positive at the time of transplant.50 Other
patients in whom HBIG-free prophylaxis would be
inappropriate would be those transplanted for HCC
at risk of recurrence, and those with limited treatment
options if recurrence did occur, such as patients
co-infected with hepatitis delta virus (HDV). HDV is
the most aggressive form of viral hepatitis without any
effective treatment options.51 Those transplanted with
co-infection must remain HBsAg negative post￾transplant to avoid recurrent delta hepatitis. With
careful patient selection, HBIG-free prophylaxis is
likely to become a standard part of post-transplant
management of hepatitis B. A potential treatment
algorithm could individualise management based on a
patient’s risk profile for HBV recurrence and identify
patients in whom HBIG withdrawal would be appro￾priate (figure 1).
CONCLUSION
The availability of safe and effective antiviral therapy
for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B has changed
how we care for patients with advanced hepatitis
B-related liver disease. With the ability to treat even
those with decompensated cirrhosis effectively with
minimal risk of resistance and few toxicities, improved
survival with or without transplantation has become
possible. For those who still require liver transplant￾ation, the improvement in graft and patient survival
with effective prophylactic treatment against viral
recurrence has meant that transplantation is indeed an
option. Future research will now look to novel therap￾ies for a functional cure of hepatitis B, which will
impact on management before and after liver
transplantation.
