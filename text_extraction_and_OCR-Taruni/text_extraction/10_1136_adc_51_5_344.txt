Huttunen, N-P. (1976). Archives of Disease in Childhood, 51, 344. Congenital
nephrotic syndrome of Finnish type: study of 75 patients. Seventy-five patients
with congenital nephrotic syndrome of Finnish type were identified in Finland in the
period 1965-1973, giving an incidence of 12X2/105. A large placenta and pro￾teinuria from birth are the hallmarks of the disease.
About one-quarter of the patients had oedema and/or abdominal distension at birth
and in all cases the full nephrotic syndrome was documented before 2 months. More
than half of the patients died before 6 months and none lived longer than 2 years 3
months. A slight rise in blood urea nitrogen or serum creatinine levels occurred in
14 cases, but in none of these did a frank uraemia develop before death. Infection
appeared to be the immediate cause of death in 31 % of the cases; in 43% no cause of
death other than congenital nephrotic syndrome could be shown. Thrombi in large
vessels were found in 11 out of 58 necropsies.
Congenital nephrotic syndrome of Finnish type
(CNF) is a distinct disease entity characterized at
birth by a large placenta and subsequently by early
onset of symptoms, complete resistance to steroids,
and death, usually within the first 2 years of life
(Hailman, Norio, and Rapola, 1973; Norio, 1974).
The disease is inherited as an autosomal recessive
trait, and is exceptionally common in Finland, where
the incidence has been estimated to be about 1 in
10 000 births (Norio, 1966). The purpose of this
investigation was to determine the frequency of the
principal clinical signs in CNF, the cause of death,
and the precise incidence of this disease in Finland.
Patients and methods
All known patients with CNF born in Finland from
the beginning of 1965 to the end of 1973, were included
in the study. Since this disease was first defined
(Hallman, Hjelt, and Ahvenainen, 1956), a list of the
new cases of CNF occurring in Finland has been main￾tained at the Children's Hospital, University of Helsinki.
Some patients were included retrospectively when a
second child with CNF was born into a family. Most
subjects were assembled from the above list, but some
were identified from a review of death certificates at the
Central Statistical Office of Finland for the years 1965-
1973.
Diagnosis of CNF was based on a large placenta,

massive proteinuria, early onset of oedema, asnd a typical
course of the disease. In 89% of the patients studied
histological examination of renal tissue obtained by
biopsy or at necropsy confirmed the diagnosis (Rapola
and Savilahti, 1971). The data presented here are
based on hospital and necropsy records. Urine analy￾ses and determinations of blood urea nitrogen or serum
creatine levels were performed by standard methods.
The control subjects were 983 infants, of known
gestational age, born consecutively in the obstetrical
ward of Hyvinkaa District Hospital during 1971 and
1972.
Results
During the years 1965-1973 a total of 75 patients
in 12 hospitals were diagnosed as having CNF.
The number of infants born alive in Finland during
the corresponding years was 614 932 (Central
Statistical Office of Finland, 1976). Based on these
figures the incidence of CNF in Finland is 12 *2/105,
or nearly 1 in 8200 births. Fig. 1 gives the ges￾tational ages of CNF patients and control subjects,
and Fig. 2 the birthweights and body lengths.
Every newborn whose gestational age ranged from
33-37 weeks, every 5th newborn whose gestational
age was 38 weeks, and every 10th newborn whose
gestational age was 39 or 40 weeks were included
in the group of controls presented in Fig. 2.
Birthweights were available for all of these 158
control newborns, and body lengths for all but 2.

FIG. 1.-Gestational ages of 983 control subjects and
74 CNF infants.
One CNF patient with a gestational age of 29
weeks and another whose gestational age was
unknown were excluded from the group of CNF
patients in Fig. 2. Body length measurements
were available for 68 of the 73 CNF patients.
There is a clear tendency for patients with CNF
to be born prematurely. In addition, CNF patients
tended to be both lighter and shorter at birth than
control subjects of equal gestational age, with
the difference in size becoming more pronounced
towards term. The mean ratio of placental/fetal
weight of CNF patients was 0 * 43, range 0 * 20-0 * 65.
In all CNF patients except one the ratio of placental/
fetal weight was more than 0 * 25. Placental/
fetal weight ratios, Apgar scores, frequency of
meconium-stained fetal fluid, and frequency of
breech presentation of patients and control subjects
are presented in Table I. CNF infants differed
significantly from control infants of the same
gestational age (P<0-001) for placental/fetal ratio
(t-test), frequency of meconium-stained fetal fluid,
and frequency of low Apgar scores (X2 test). The
number of breech presentations among CNF
patients whose gestational age was 36 weeks or less
was 4 out of31 and among those whose gestational age

Proteinuria occurred in all but one patient from
the time of the first urine sample (Table II). The
time of onset of oedema or abdominal distension
was noted in 61 CNF patients (Table II), either or
both occurring during the first week of life in 32,
during the first month in 55, and in none later than
2 months of age. The exact time of and reason for
the first admission to a paediatric ward was known
in 69 cases (Table III). (1) Asphyxia or prematurity
during the first day of life in 23 out of 33 cases, and
later in only 4 out of 36. (2) Oedema or abdominal
distension during the first day of life in 4 out of 33
cases, and later in 15 out of 36. (3) Alarge placenta,
proteinuria, or definitive diagnosis of CNF in 15.
Information about the blood urea nitrogen (BUN)
or serum creatinine levels was available for 50
CNF patients. Slightly raised levels of BUN
occurred in 8 patients (range 23 - 57 mg/100 ml) and
of serum creatinine in 6 (range 0*8-3 * 0 mg/100 ml).
In none, however, was a uraemic syndrome docu￾mented.
All CNF patients died during the observation
period. Length of survival is shown in Fig. 3.
Mean survival for the 75 patients was 7 *6 months.
The oldest patient was aged 2 years 2 months
10 days at death. At necropsy, thrombosis of the
inferior vena cava was found in 7 cases, of sagittal
sinus in 1, of cerebral vein in 1, and of right atrium
in 1. In addition, 1 patient died of a pulmonary
embolism that had originated from the right atrium.
Severe thromboembolic complications were found
in a total of 11 out of 58 necropsies. Cause of
death of CNF patients is shown in Table IV. In￾fection was considered to be the cause of death in
23 cases, renal transplantation in 9, thrombotic
complications in 4, and other definable causes in 7.
Death could be attributed to no definable cause
other than CNF in 32 cases.
Discussion
Taking into account all previously published cases
(Norio, 1966; Hallman, Norio, and Kouvalainen,
1967) plus the cases in the present study in which
the period of investigation extended through 1973,
a total of 151 CNF patients from 119 families have
been identified in Finland. The incidence of CNF
based on the results of the present study, ie., 1 in
8200 births, is higher than than that estimated by
Norio (1966). The awareness of Finnish physic￾ians of this disease has certainly improved during
the last 10 years. Nevertheless, though the clinical

features are extremely characteristic and the illness
is easy to diagnose at a few weeks of age, even now
some patients with CNF undoubtedly die during
the first days of life from asphyxia or other neonatal
complications without CNF having been diagnosed.
Hence the estimated incidence may be slightly low.
An uncommonly large placenta is the most promi￾nent sign of CNF at birth and has been emphasized
in earlier studies (Kouvalainen, Hjelt, and Hallman,
1962; Hallman et al., 1970; Hallman et al., 1973).

/fetal weight was less than 0 * 25. This lightest
placenta belonged to a twin who had a healthy
twin sister whose ratio of placental/fetal weight
was recorded as 0*22. It is possible that the
placentas of the twins were exchanged by mistake at
delivery. If this highly likely error were corrected,
the ratio of placental/fetal weight of the CNF twin
would be 0-27. A large placenta accompanied by
retarded intrauterine growth, and frequently by
signs of prenatal asphyxia indicate that CNF is a
congenital disease that begins in utero. The re￾cording of one protein-free urine sample in the
present series was almost certainly an error because
there is good evidence that in both proteinuria
(Seppala and Ruoslahti, 1972) and severe hypopro￾teinaemia (Kouvalainen, 1963) onset occurs before

birth. No good explanation can be given for the
abnormally high frequency of breech presentation,
but it is supposed that the large placenta interferes
with normal intrauterine movements of the fetus
(Hallman et al., 1970).
Pre- and postnatal asphyxia, probably caused by
defective function of the oedematous placenta,
is a frequent finding in CNF. Asphyxia and
prematurity are the most frequent causes for
admission to paediatric wards immediately after
birth; symptoms of the nephrotic syndrome are the
main reasons for admission after the postnatal
period. Either oedema or abdominal distension
brought on by ascites or by meteoristic bowel were
already present in one-quarter of the patients at
birth, and in no patient was the full nephrotic
syndrome noted later than the age of 2 months.
By a few months of age the oedema often disap￾pears and the children then tend to be dystrophic,
though the abdominal distension usually persists
(Hallman et al., 1970).
Length of survival of CNF patients has remained
practically unchanged since 1965 (Hallman et al.,
1970). In the present series more than half of the
infants had died by 6 months and none reached the
age of 21 years. Nearly 19% of the necropsies on
CNF patients showed either a venous or arterial
thrombosis. A tendency towards thrombosis has
also been observed in other types of nephrotic
syndrome (Levin, Zamit, and Schmaman 1967;
Lewy and Wellington, 1974). The hypothesis
that steroid therapy might be an aetiological factor
in thrombosis (Lieberman et al., 1968; Mukherjee
et al., 1970) receives no support here, because none
of the CNF patients with thrombotic complications
had been given steroids. Hypovolaemia and an
increased incidence of sepsis (Lieberman et al., 1968)
together with disturbances in coagulation (Lange
et al., 1974) or in fibrinolysis (Scheinman and
Stiehm, 1971) are probably the factors which pre￾dispose patients to the formation of intravascular
thrombi, in both CNF and other types of nephrotic
syndrome.
Infections or other definitive causes of death
could be documented in about one-half of the CNF
patients, whereas in the remainder only CNF could
be shown. Though a slight rise of BUN or serum
creatinine levels was noted in 14 cases, in none of
these could a frank uraemic syndrome be considered
as the immediate cause of death. Presumably,
massive and continuous protein leakage produces a
a state of severe protein depletion and weakened
bodily defences, so that sudden death may leave no
detectable signs for the pathologist except those of
CNF itself.
