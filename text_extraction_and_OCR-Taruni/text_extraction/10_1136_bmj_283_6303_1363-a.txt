Parental smoking at home and
height of children
It is recognised that smoking by mothers during pregnancy is
associated with low birth weight' and that the subsequent physical
growth of children born to these mothers is impaired.2 Babies with
parents who smoke also have more respiratory illness in the first year
of life.3 Data from a study in Cleveland of 539 6- and 7-year-old
children suggested an association between short stature in the child
and number of smokers in the home. We tested this hypothesis using
data from the National Study of Health and Growth, which provided
a large sample of primary schoolchildren.
Methods and results
In the National Study of Health and Growth the heights of children in
28 stutdy areas in England and Scotland were measured. Each child's parents
gave information on the father's occupation, parents' reported height,
number of siblings of the child, and child's birth weight. In 1977 we also
included questions on the number of people smoking at least five cigarettes
a day at home and the child's respiratory symptoms. The study design and
measurement technique have been described elsewhere.4 The children were
divided into three groups according to whether there were no smokers, one
smoker, or two or more smokers in the home. In an analysis of variance we
tested for a trend of height across the three smoking categories and allowed
for variables that might be related to both smoking behaviour and stature.
Standardised height by age, sex, and country of residence was obtained for
each child as the difference between his height and the mean height in his
group divided by the standard deviation for that population.5
A strong inverse association was found between height and number of
smokers at home (p<O0OO1 in England and p<O0O1 in Scotland). Children
with one smoker at home had an intermediate mean height compared with
the two other groups in both countries (figure). After adjustment for the

child's birth weight to allow for the mother's smoking during pregnancy
the trend was still significant in England (p <0 001) but borderline in
Scotland (p <0 1). After further adjustments for the father's social class, the
mother's and father's heights, and the number of siblings a significant trend
remained in the English sample (p= 0-01) and a non-significant trend in the
Scottish sample (the Scottish sample was one-third the size of the English).
A similar analysis by sex showed a significant trend for boys but not for girls
in England after all other independent variables had been allowed for. In
Scotland the trend was observed only in girls (p<0 05). The number of
respiratory symptoms in the previous 12 months did not explain the associa￾tion between height and smoking behaviour at home.
Comment
The association between smokers at home and children's height
cannot be explained by smoking in pregnancy because adjusting for
each child's birth weight did not eliminate differences in height
between the groups. The significant gradient found in England after
adjustment for the parents' height, number of siblings, and father's
social class is further evidence that the association is due to passive
smoking. In Scotland a trend of the same magnitude as in England
was not significant.
We investigated whether respiratory symptoms in childhood were
a necessary step between passive smoking and a child's impaired
growth. Our analysis indicated that this is unlikely. Respiratory
symptoms before the child entered school, however, may have played
a part.
Passive smoking at home, therefore, seems to affect the growth of
children. The maximum difference in mean height between groups
was about 1 cm. This was the value reported by Butler and Goldstein2
in 7- and 1 1-year-old children whose mothers smoked during
pregnancy.

Human papovavirus isolated from
urine of a child with acute tonsillitis
The human papovavirus BK has been isolated exclusively from people
who were immunologically impaired' and from pregnant women.2 In
these cases the presence of infective virus seemed to result from virus
reactivation as shown by the presence of BK virus antibodies before
virus excretion. Isolation of BK virus has not been reported during
the primary infection of immunologically competent individuals even
though antibody surveys have shown a 60-80% prevalence of BK virus
antibodies in adults. Antibodies to BK virus usually occur in early
childhood.3 Serological studies have suggested a possible association
between primary infection with BK virus and acute upper respiratory
tract disease.4 We report the isolation of a human papovavirus from
urine of an immunologically competent child with acute tonsillitis.
Case report
On 16 October 1980 a 2-year-old mentally retarded boy was admitted to
the department of pacdiatrics of the university clinic with dyspnoea and high
fever. Physical examination showed nasal discharge, swollen inflamed tonsils,
enlarged cervical lymph nodes, and conjunctival irritation. His medical
history included several hospital admissions for acute respiratory and gastro￾intestinal illnesses. Laboratory investigations showed normal biochemical
values for blood and urine, normal serum immunoglobulin concentrations,
and normal lymphocyte functions. Throat cultures were negative for
haemolytic streptococci. Bacterial cultures of urine and faeces showed normal
flora. Within 11 days he had recovered from the tonsillitis, and he left the
hospital on 27 October in good health. On the third day of the illness a throat
swab and urine sample were collected for virological examination and
inoculated into cultures of primary thyroid cells.

After 28 days urine cultures showed cytopathic changes characterised by
cytoplasmic vacuolisation. Electron microscopy of the supernatant showed
icosahedral virus particles with a diameter of about 45 nm. Supernatants
from the urine cultures agglutinated human type 0 erythrocytes and the
agglutination could be inhibited by a specific anti-BK virus serum. No
cytopathic effect was observed in control cells and throat swab cultures.
Seroconversion against BK virus between the third and 14th day of the
disease (haemagglutination inhibiting antibody titres 1:8-1:256) was shown.
Similar titres were obtained when the patient's virus was used as the antigen.
No appreciable rises in antibodies to adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus,
influenza virus types A and B, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydia
psittaci were observed as measured by the complement fixation test. Analysis
of the viral DNA by cleavage with several restriction endonucleases showed
a pattern compatible with BK virus-like human papovaviruses.
Comment
This report describes seroconversion against BK virus and subse￾quent isolation of virus from the urine of a child with acute tonsillitis.
The child's humoral and cellular immunity was not impaired and no
immunosuppressive treatment was given. Our findings should
encourage further attempts to isolate BK virus from patients with
acute respiratory disease.

Prognosis of isolated seizures in
adult life
An isolated epileptic fit is a matter of concern to the patient, his
family, and his doctor. While the problem for the doctor is to determine
any underlying cause, the patient is naturally anxious about further
fits. We report here our findings on the follow-up of a group of 70
adults who suffered a single fit.
Subjects, methods, and results
We analysed the notes of all patients aged 16 to 65 with a single blackout
referred to the Regional Neurological Centre, Newcastle General Hospital.
Only those referred before 1978 and who had suffered a definite witnessed
major convulsion were included in the study. Patients whose convulsion
had been associated with head injury or drug overdose or who had been
started *on anticonvulsants were excluded. The suitable patients were
contacted and their notes analysed for prognostic indicators.
Eighty-four patients fulfilled the criteria, of whom 14 could not be
contacted. Of the remaining 70, 30 were women and 40 men with a mean age
of 36. The mean time between the fit and the outpatient visit was six and a
half weeks (range two to 10 weeks but 80 %f were between five to seven
weeks) and the mean follow-up period was 4 years 9 months (range three to
10 years). Twenty-seven (39%) patients subsequently developed epilepsy
while 43 (61 %') had no further fits. The time intervals between the first and
second fits are shown in the figure.
There was no difference between those who had single and recurrent fits in
age, sex, or period of follow-up. In three (12 %°) of the former and nine (22 %)
of the latter group there were possible precipitating factors and these were
the same for the two groups-namely, exertion, infection, alcohol, lack of
sleep, and anaesthesia. None of the patients had a family history of epilepsy
or any abnormal neurological signs. Thirty-nine per cent (15 out of 38) of
those who had single fits and 68 °% (17 out of 25) of those who had recurrent

fits had abnormal electroencephalograms (EEGs). This difference was
significant (x2; 1 df -491; p <005). The abnormalities were the same in
the two groups and were either non-specific abnormalities, focal slowing
over the temporal lobe, or generalised slow activity. One patient, aged 20,
who had a second fit two months after the first was subsequently found to
have a cerebral tumour (grade II astrocytoma).
Comment
The development of epilepsy in adult life is a sinister event, for
about 10°,, of such patients will turn out to have an intracranial
tumour.' On the other hand, a single fit is usually regarded as a one￾off occurrence, not warranting concern or investigation.2 Little has
been written on the prognosis of patients presenting with an isolated
fit. Clearly all first fits are "isolated" until a second one occurs and
then the patient is, by definition, suffering from epilepsy. We thought
that a convenient time to label a fit as isolated was at the outpatient
visit, about six weeks after the event.
This study, broadly confirming other reports,3 shows that 39%
of patients with an isolated fit developed epilepsy after a mean follow￾up period of 4 years 9 months. Moreover, significantly more of this
group had an abnormal EEG at the time of their first fit. Thus,
though a single EEG recording is of limited value in diagnosing
epilepsy, it is a useful indicator as to the likelihood of further fits.
An interesting finding is that the risk of further fits remains high
for two years after an isolated fit. Thus the chances against a second
fit six weeks, six months, one year, and two years after an isolated fit
are respectively 2 6:1, 3 2:1, 4 1:1, and 15:1. Given an incidence5 of
20 per 100 000, the annual chance of an adult having a fit is one in
5000.
We believe that an adult with an isolated fit should be investigated
in the same way as an adult with epilepsy of recent onset. Though six
months is a reasonable time to withhold a driver's licence, the patient
should be warned that the risk of further fits remains high for another
18 months.
