REVIEW
NAFLD as a continuum: from obesity 
to metabolic syndrome and diabetes
Amélio F. Godoy‑Matos1*, Wellington S. Silva Júnior2 and Cynthia M. Valerio1
Abstract
Background: The prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has been increasing rapidly. It is nowadays 
recognized as the most frequent liver disease, affecting a quarter of global population and regularly coexisting with 
metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and cardiovascular disease. In a more simplistic 
view, NAFLD could be defined as an increase in liver fat content, in the absence of secondary cause of steatosis. In 
fact, the clinical onset of the disease is a much more complex process, closely related to insulin resistance, limited 
expandability and dysfunctionality of adipose tissue. A fatty liver is a main driver for a new recognized liver-pancreatic 
α-cell axis and increased glucagon, contributing to diabetes pathophysiology.
Main text: This review will focus on the clinical and pathophysiological connections between NAFLD, insulin resist‑
ance and type 2 diabetes. We reviewed non-invasive methods and several scoring systems for estimative of steatosis 
and fibrosis, proposing a multistep process for NAFLD evaluation. We will also discuss treatment options with a more 
comprehensive view, focusing on the current available therapies for obesity and/or type 2 diabetes that impact each 
stage of NAFLD.
Conclusion: The proper understanding of NAFLD spectrum—as a continuum from obesity to metabolic syndrome 
and diabetes—may contribute to the early identification and for establishment of targeted treatment.

Background
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a spectrum 
of hepatic diseases associated with metabolic and cardio￾vascular disorders, such as obesity, insulin resistance (IR), 
hypertension, dyslipidemia and type 2 diabetes (T2D). It 
is frequently recognized as the hepatic manifestation of 
the metabolic syndrome (MetS) [1] and constitute the 
most frequent liver condition worldwide [2–4].
NAFLD is characterized by increased liver fat content, 
with a threshold of>5%, in the absence of significant 
alcohol consumption or other secondary cause of stea￾tosis, including alcohol consumption (characterized as 
30 g/day for men and 20 g/day for women) [5, 6]. It can be 
subcategorized as nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL), when 
there is only evidence of hepatic steatosis on liver his￾tology, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), when 
there are steatosis, lobular inflammation and hepatocyte 
ballooning with or without perisinusoidal fibrosis [3]. 
NAFLD may progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular 
carcinoma, but its cardiometabolic counterparts are the 
main cause of morbimortality in those patients [4, 7].
A panel of 22 international experts recently proposed 
the definition criteria for the metabolic-associated fatty 
liver disease (MAFLD) [8]. MAFLD is defined as the pres￾ence of hepatic steatosis (histological, imaging or blood 
biomarker evidence of hepatic steatosis) plus at least one 
of three metabolic criteria: overweight/obesity, estab￾lished T2D or the presence of metabolic dysregulation

[8]. The latter is characterized by the presence of at least 
2 metabolic abnormalities (Table 1).
Importantly, this “MAFLD definition” avoid the dichot￾omous view of NAFL and NASH, since it is based in “pos￾itive” criterion (evidence of hepatic steatosis) instead of 
“negative” criterion hard to exclude (i.e., alcohol ingestion 
quantification), and also allows concomitant dual etiol￾ogy or “alternate causes” (e.g., alcohol, medications or rare 
diseases) in association with a metabolic risk profile [8].
Therefore, the aiming of this article is to review epi￾demiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment of 
NAFLD with focus on its metabolic profile and evolution 
through the natural history of obesity, MetS and T2D.
Epidemiology
Although epidemiological data involving more than 8 
million people estimated a global prevalence of NAFLD 
around 25% [2], it certainly varies greatly depending on 
how it is diagnosed and on the region of the world consid￾ered. Importantly, the 2 highest regional prevalence were 
observed in Middle East and South America (approxi￾mately 30%) [2]. Roughly 60% of those people subjected 
to liver biopsy presented with NASH. In accordance with 
its metabolic nature, 42% of NAFLD subjects had MetS; 
69%, hyperlipidemia; 51%, obesity; 39%, hypertension; 
and 22%, diabetes [2].
Obesity
The prevalence of NAFLD increases in parallel with the 
increasing prevalence in obesity, MetS and T2D. The 
number of people with obesity have increased globally 
from 1975 to 2014, when 11% of adult men and 15% of 
adult women were diagnosed with this condition [9]. In 
Brazil, obesity increased 67.8% within 13 years, reaching 
19.8% in 2018 [10].
As introduced above, worldwide prevalence of obesity 
among NAFLD and NASH patients were 51 and 81%, 
respectively [2]. In populations with obesity, NAFLD 
prevalence varies from 60 to 95% [11, 12].
Fat distribution is a main pathophysiological mecha￾nism for metabolic disease, and abdominal obesity may 
differ from a more equally fat distribution. Although a 
recent consensus underscores the importance of measur￾ing waist circumference (WC) as part of a more reliable 
estimate of metabolic risk, abdominal obesity prevalence 
has increased more than general obesity by a given body 
mass index (BMI) [13]. Additionally, in a cohort of 2017 
subjects followed-up for 4.4  years, visceral fat area, as 
estimated by ultrasonography (US) or computed tomog￾raphy (CT), was longitudinally associated with incidence 
of NAFLD, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 2.23 (95% CI 
1.28–3.89) [14].
Metabolic syndrome
MetS is characterized as a cluster of metabolic disorders 
such as abdominal obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia 
and impaired glycemia [15]. It has 2 mains definitions 
(Table  2) and is highly prevalent worldwide [16, 17]. 
According to the National Health and Nutrition Exami￾nation Survey (NHANES), more than a third of Ameri￾can adults presented MetS, with an increment of more 
than 35% from 1988–1994 to 2007–2012 [18, 19]. Com￾prehensively, as obesity rate rises, so does the prevalence 
of MetS. In ten large European cohorts (163,517 individ￾uals), the age-standardized percentage of obese subjects 
with MetS ranged from 24 to 65% in women and from 
43% to 78% in men [20].
The association of MetS with the prevalence and sever￾ity of NAFLD, assessed by US and NAFLD Fibrosis score 
(NFS), was evaluated in a cohort of 11,647 individuals 
[21]. Despite the prevalence of NAFLD was 18.2% (95% 
CI 16.5–19.9), it was significantly greater (43.2%) in those 
with MetS (OR 11.5, 95%CI 8.9–14.7) and increased with 
the number of MetS criteria (67% for those with all five 
criteria). More important, advanced hepatic fibrosis was 
present in 6.6% in those with moderate/severe steato￾sis, almost doubled in the presence of MetS and reached 
impressive 30% in those with five MetS criteria [21].
Diabetes
Diabetes is one of the fastest growing global health emer￾gencies of the 21st century [22]. Around 463 million peo￾ple worldwide was living with diabetes in 2019, and a 
51% increase is expected to 2045, raising the prevalence 
of diabetes to 700 million. Brazil is the fifth country with 
the highest number of people with diabetes in the world 
(16.8 million) [22].

The association between T2D and NAFLD is well 
established. Notwithstanding, physicians may not be 
conscious enough how this association may be deleteri￾ous [23]. NAFLD is highly prevalent in T2D patients, 
according to two meta-analyses [24, 25]. Dai et  al. [24] 
extracted data from 24 studies with 35,599 T2D patients 
and found a pooled NAFLD prevalence of 59.67% (95% 
CI 54.31–64.92), which rose to 77.87% (95% CI 65.51–
88.14) in those with obesity. Moreover, data from 80 
studies (49,419 individuals) evidenced a global NAFLD 
prevalence of 55.5% (95% CI 47.3–63.7) among patients 
with T2D [25]. Pooled studies carried out in Europe evi￾denced 68% (95% CI 62.1–73.0) of prevalence, which was 
the highest globally. The estimated prevalence of NASH 
and advanced fibrosis among individuals with NAFLD 
and T2D were 37.3% (95% CI 24.7–50.0) and 17.0% (95% 
CI 7.2–34.8), respectively [25]. Furthermore, the over￾all mortality ratio in 5–10  years was 585 per 100,000, 
which was greater than mortality from others chronic 
liver diseases. The majority of the NAFLD patients with 
T2D fulfilled criteria for MetS, highlighting the rela￾tionship between these conditions in the metabolic risk 
continuum.
Pathogenesis
Overweight and obesity are the main drivers of metabolic 
diseases and NAFLD. Nevertheless, not all obese are 
metabolically unhealthy, neither all normal weight/lean 
are metabolically healthy. Fat distribution, adipose tissue 
(AT) functionality and IR constitute the basis of meta￾bolic disturbances such as MetS, diabetes and NAFLD 
[26].
More than 10  years ago, Virtue and Puig [27] putted 
forward the “AT expandability hypothesis”, by which the 
capacity for stock lipids by expanding AT is limited in 
an individualized fashion. Therefore, when the capacity 
of expansion is reached, lipids can no longer be stored 
in AT and it is stored in ectopic tissues, like muscle and 
liver, where promotes IR, through a lipotoxic effect.
The AT expandability hypothesis has relevant clinical 
implications. It explains, for example, the metabolic pat￾tern usually observed in patients with lipodystrophies. 
These genetic diseases are characterized by different 
degrees of incapacity to expand subcutaneous adipose 
tissue (SAT) and increased ectopic fat in muscle [28], 
liver [29] and pancreas [30]. Consequently, patients with 
lipodystrophies have severe IR, which can lead to MetS, 
NAFLD and diabetes. The hypothesis also corroborates 
the action of thiazolidinediones (TZDs), insulin sensitiz￾ers approved to treat T2D. TZDs promote adipocyte dif￾ferentiation of preadipocyte and mesenchymal stem cell 
lines, improving triglyceride storage capacity of the SAT 
[31] and increasing adiponectin levels [32], an adipokine 
with insulin sensitizer properties [33]. It suggests positive 
effects of TZDs on NAFLD, and this will be discussed 
below.
Adipose tissue: a main culprit for metabolic health?
White adipose tissue is composed of SAT and visceral 
adipose tissue (VAT). SAT is the most appropriate local 
for fat storage due to its expandability and plasticity [34], 
while VAT is more associated with metabolic disorders. 
Nonetheless, some evidence corroborate that VAT may 
be a bystander and peripheral SAT may be of utmost 
importance for metabolic health [35, 36]. Impairment of 
peripheral fat storage capacity is etiological and geneti￾cally associated with IR and metabolic diseases [36] and 
support the AT expandability hypothesis. Moreover, a 
subgroup of normal weight metabolically unhealthy indi￾viduals is relatively frequent within the general popu￾lation, which combined with the scarcity of leg fat [36], 
strongly suggests a polygenic lipodystrophy-like pheno￾type, with high risk for both NAFLD and cardiometabolic 
diseases.
Peripheral AT scarcity may partially explain NAFLD 
pathogenesis, but the AT insulin resistance per se may

have a seminal role. Indeed, liver fat accumulation is 
strongly associated with diminishing AT insulin sensi￾tivity, as evidenced by the negative correlation between 
liver fat content and the suppression of free fatty acids 
(FFAs) by insulin (r=−0.38; p<0.001), concordant with 
the lipotoxicity theory [37]. Moreover, hepatic IR become 
present early, with liver fat content~1,5%, while muscle 
IR, high triglycerides and low HDL cholesterol become 
apparent when liver fat content reaches around 6,0%, 
suggesting that liver fat content works as a sensitive 
“barometer” for metabolic health [37]. In summary, AT 
may be pointed as a main culprit for NAFLD and meta￾bolic disturbance [38].
Genetic predisposition
Genome-wide association (GWA) studies found several 
genetic variants associated with NAFLD, which implies 
in variability on individual susceptibility to the disease 
[39]. PNPLA3 (encoding patatin-like phospholipase 
domain-containing protein 3) and TM6SF2 (encoding 
transmembrane 6 superfamily member 2) have more 
consistently demonstrated association with NAFLD 
prevalence and severity [39]. Interestingly, those genetic 
variants does not compromise metabolic profile [40]. For 
example, the strongest genetic risk for fatty liver to date, 
PNPLA3 variant rs738409-G, is associated with a neutral 
effect on lipids, and the TM6SF2 rs58542926-T, with a 
benign lipid profile [40]. This suggests that NAFL and/or 
NASH are not necessarily, by themselves, causal for car￾diometabolic risk.
The new liver‑pancreas axis, diabetes and NAFLD
Insulin and glucagon are the main pancreatic hormones 
responsible for fuel homeostasis. They have a recipro￾cal pattern of release in response to glycemic oscillations 
[41]. Besides the well-known insulin relationship with 
liver glucose production and utilization, glucagon is an 
important player in liver glucose production and diabetes 
pathophysiology (briefly reviewed in [41]).
Knop et  al. [42] and Holst et  al. [43] proposed a new 
axis between the liver and the pancreatic α-cells. In 
physiological situation, glucagon increases the hepatic 
clearance of amino acids (AAs), so promoting ureagen￾esis. As AAs stimulate glucagon production and release 
by α-cells, the reduced circulating AAs relieves glucagon 
production, keeping them in balance. However, when 
the liver becomes greasy, there is a reduction in sensitiv￾ity to glucagon in the AAs metabolism (hepatic glucagon 
resistance), reducing ureagenesis and resulting in hyper￾aminoacidemia. Consequently, increased AAs stimulate 
glucagon production to compensate for glucagon resist￾ance, and a vicious cycle is installed. Liver-α-cell axis has 
been demonstrated in rodents [44, 45] and humans [42].
Increased fasting glucagon may precedes diabetes. 
Indeed, normal glucose tolerant obese patients have 
already fasting hyperglucagonemia [46], which is related 
to liver steatosis [47]. NAFLD patients have fasting 
hyperglucagonemia when compared to people without 
NAFLD regardless of diabetes presence [48]. In accord￾ance, not only glucagon but also non-branched-chain 
AAs are increased in NAFLD patients and they correlate 
positively with each other [49].
Glucagon resistance is associated with glucagono￾trophic AAs and this association is modified by increased 
liver fat content. Wewer Albrechtsen et al. [50] proposed 
a glucagon-alanine index [glucagon-alanine index=fast￾ing plasma glucagon (pmol/L)×fasting plasma alanine 
(pmol/L)] as a marker of hepatic glucagon sensitivity in 
liver.
The other side of the liver-pancreas axis is suggested by 
the appearance of hepatic steatosis post-pancreatectomy 
(absence of α-cell) in dogs (reviewed in [42]) and humans 
[42, 51]. Indeed, knockout of glucagon receptors in mice 
lead to α-cell hyperplasia and steatosis [44, 45]. Addi￾tionally, Guzman et al. [52] showed a significant increase 
in liver fat content following the use of a new glucagon 
receptor antagonist in patients with T2D in compari￾son to sitagliptin and placebo (3,7% and 4,4% increment, 
respectively) [52].
We highlight that hepatic IR and glucagon resistance 
at the AAs metabolism can putatively contribute to 
T2D development in NAFLD patients [53], and it might 
have clinical and therapeutic implications. Treatments 
targeting weight loss and/or reducing liver fat content 
may restore the physiology of the liver-pancreas axis, so 
decreasing IR and glucagon levels, and possibly mitigat￾ing the increase in hepatic glucose production. Therefore, 
these may contribute to prevent T2D development or 
worsening [53].
The multi‑hit hypothesis
Pathophysiology of NAFLD was originally suggested 
by the “two-hit hypothesis”. Fat accumulation in liver 
promotes IR (“first hit”), which in turn triggers inflam￾matory mechanisms and fibrosis (“second hit”). The 
“multi-hit hypothesis,” however, seems to be more com￾plete, considering that environmental influences can 
affect the expression of genes, inducing weight gain, 
increased FFAs mobilization, ectopic fat deposition 
and IR [1] (Fig.  1). IR is a major factor in the genesis 
of NASH [37, 54], since it facilitates lipolysis, increas￾ing the flux of FFAs to the liver and hepatic lipogenesis 
de novo. Inflamed dysfunctional AT releases adipokines 
and inflammatory cytokines as IL-6 and TNFα-1, while 
decreases anti-inflammatory adiponectin. In the liver, 
triglycerides and toxic metabolites induces lipotoxicity, 

Godoy‑Matos et al. Diabetol Metab Syndr (2020) 12:60 Page 5 of 20
mitochondrial dysfunction and endoplasmic reticulum 
stress, leading to hepatocyte damage, apoptosis and 
fibrosis [1].
NAFLD diagnosis
NASH is characterized when, in addition to steatosis, 
there is evidence of lobular inflammation and hepatocyte 
ballooning with or without perisinusoidal fibrosis on the 
liver histology [5].
This could be considered the first gap of the NAFLD 
management. Even consisting the “gold standard” method 
for NASH diagnosis (and differentiation of NAFL), liver 
biopsy has some limitations related to invasiveness, 
patient discomfort, sampling variability and pathologist 
experience. Additionally, its cost-effectiveness needs to 
be demonstrated since approved NASH-specific thera￾pies are currently not available [55].
Liver biopsy
The American Association for the Study of Liver Dis￾eases (AASLD) [5] recommends biopsy for patients 
with NAFLD who are at increased risk of NASH and/
Fig. 1 Pathophysiology of NAFLD as a continuum from obesity to metabolic syndrome and diabetes. Environmental factors affect the expression 
of genes, inducing weight gain. When the capacity of expansion of subcutaneous adipose tissue (AT) is reached, an increased free fatty acids (FFAs) 
mobilization arises, resulting in visceral and ectopic fat deposition. One ectopic site is the muscle, where increased FFAs deposition promotes 
insulin resistance (IR), inhibiting insulin-mediated glucose uptake. On the other hand, AT insulin resistance facilitates lipolysis and increases the 
flux of FFAs to the liver, inducing hepatic IR and enhancing glucose production, de novo hepatic lipogenesis, VLDL release and atherogenic 
dyslipidemia. FFAs spill over into the pancreas, causing β-cell dysfunction by lipotoxicity, hyperglycemia and diabetes (the twin cycle hypothesis). 
Increased liver fat also promotes hepatic glucagon resistance (GR) over the amino acids (AAs) metabolism, reducing ureagenesis and resulting 
in hyper-aminoacidemia. Increased AAs stimulate glucagon production to compensate for hepatic GR, and a vicious cycle is installed (the 
liver-pancreas axis). This hyperglucagonemia also leads to an increased hepatic glucose release. The globally IR state results in hyperinsulinemia, 
which may enhance sodium reabsorption and increase sympathetic nervous system activity, contributing to the hypertension. Inflamed 
dysfunctional AT becomes more insulin resistant and releases pro-inflammatory adipokines, while decreases anti-inflammatory adiponectin. In the 
liver, triglycerides and toxic metabolites induce lipotoxicity, mitochondrial dysfunction and endoplasmic reticulum stress, leading to hepatocyte 
damage, apoptosis and fibrosis. These dysfunctional hepatocytes synthesize and secret the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), which promotes 
inflammation of AT macrophages and more IR. AAs amino acids, AT adipose tissue, DPP4 dipeptidyl peptidase 4, FFA free fatty acid, GR glucagon

or advanced fibrosis, specifically when coexisting etiolo￾gies for hepatic steatosis and the presence or severity of 
any other liver diseases cannot be excluded without the 
biopsy.
Classically, some patients can be considered high-risk 
for NASH, including those with MetS, elevated ami￾notransferases (particularly with an elevated ALT/AST 
ratio), older age (>60 years) and Hispanic ethnicity [55]. 
Important the most (as risk marker) is the number of 
MetS components (Table  2), reinforcing the idea of a 
continuous disease.
The pathology should be descriptive, including a dis￾tinction between NAFL, NAFL with inflammation and 
NASH (steatosis with lobular and portal inflammation 
and hepatocellular ballooning), and defining the pres￾ence or absence of fibrosis [5]. For clinical purposes, the 
description of severity (mild, moderate, severe) is indi￾cated, as well as the use of specific scoring systems such 
as NAFLD Activity score (NAS) [56] and/or Steatosis 
Activity Fibrosis (SAF) [57].
Although liver biopsy is considered very useful in dif￾ferentiating NASH from other diseases, most of the 
patients with NAFL will not progress to NASH and 
advanced fibrosis. Moreover, the routine screening for 
NAFLD with liver biopsy is unfeasible for a great number 
of high-risk patients, and this invasive procedure has sev￾eral drawbacks, such as sampling error, high cost, inter￾and intra-observer variability and risk of complications 
[58]. In this context, non-invasive methods could be per￾formed for the detection and follow up of the patients.
Non‑invasive evaluation tests
Imaging techniques
Ultrasonography In clinical practice, US is the first-line 
imaging exam used for the diagnosis of hepatic steatosis 
because its wide availability and lower-cost. A meta-anal￾ysis of 49 studies demonstrated an 84% of sensitivity and 
93,6% of specificity for the detection of moderate-severe 
fatty liver when compared to histology (gold standard). 
The area under the curve (AUC) was 0.93 (95%CI 0.91–
0.95) [59]. Despite that, biopsy-controlled study involving 
patients with NASH showed that the sensibility drops in 
initial steatosis, and a relevant number of patients can be 
missed when the US is used to detect 5–20% of fat liver 
disease [60].
Computed tomography Steatosis may be detected on 
non-contrast CT, but due its lower sensitivity and expo￾sure to radiation, it is less useful than US as a screening 
test [59].
Transient elastography (TE) A best-validated non￾invasive method for fibrosis evaluation is TE using US 
(e.g., FibroScan). It consists on measuring steatosis by 
reporting the loss of ultrasound signal through the liver 
parenchyma, which is reported as the controlled attenu￾ation parameter (CAP) [61].
In a meta-analysis, CAP had a sensitivity and speci￾ficity of 78% and 79%, respectively, for detecting S1 
steatosis [61]. CAP is less robust, however, in discrimi￾nating between steatosis grades, with an AUC of 0.73 
and 0.70 for distinguishing S3 vs. S0–2 and S2–3 vs. 
S0–1, respectively [62].
The liver stiffness measurement (LSM), expressed in 
kilopascals (kPa) is another parameter of TE to meas￾ure shear wave’s velocity or liver fibrosis. It is of interest 
to exclude advanced fibrosis. In a cohort of 761 NAFLD 
patients, for instance, at a cutoff < 8  kPa, TE had a 
94–100% negative predictive value [63].
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) MRI has a better 
sensitivity for the evaluation of hepatic steatosis (with 
92–100% sensitivity, 92–97% specificity) than US, but 
it is significantly more expensive. Magnetic resonance 
spectroscopy (MRI-S) and magnetic resonance imag￾ing-estimated proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) 
quantify steatosis. Although highly accurate, MRI-S only 
measures fat in small regions of interest, while MRI￾PDFF allows mapping of the entire liver [60]. None of 
these imaging modalities can differentiate NAFL from 
NASH, and they have limited ability to discern those 
patients with advanced fibrosis.
On the other hand, MRI with elastography (MRE) is 
a better method for identifying degrees of fibrosis in 
patients with NAFLD. In a prospective cohort of 117 
patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD, MRE showed 
a high diagnostic accuracy, with AUCs of 0.84 for the 
detection any fibrosis and 0.92 for advanced fibrosis. 
The optimal cutoff for advanced fibrosis was 3.64  kPa 
[64].
In another meta-analysis based on 5 studies and 628 
NAFLD patients, the pooled AUC of MRE for advanced 
fibrosis was 0.96, showing the highest diagnostic accu￾racy for staging fibrosis in comparison to TE and 
indexes like Fibrosis-4 index (FIB-4) and NFS [65].
Scoring systems for estimative of steatosis or fibrosis
Several non-invasive models of blood biochemical mark￾ers or indexes have been proposed to estimate steatosis 
or fibrosis in NAFLD (Table  3). They are usually based 
on variables and calculated with formulas previously 
published. Among the scoring systems, FIB-4 index and 
NFS have been mostly studied and validated for estima￾tive of fibrosis [66, 67]. They may be useful for exclud￾ing fibrosis, with a 97% specificity for stages F3 and F4 of

estimating steatosis degree, WC and MetS are parame￾ters used in Fatty Liver index and NAFLD Liver Fat score, 
respectively, reinforcing the continuous nature of the dis￾ease [69, 70].
Multistep approach for NAFLD diagnosis and follow‑up
Screening and diagnosing NAFLD is a multistep process. 
All patients at high risk (i.e., patients with obesity and/
or MetS or T2D) might be targeted promptly for ruling 
out NAFL/NASH and fibrosis. Considering the increas￾ing incidence of NAFLD and the inherent limitations 
of liver biopsy, we suggest a preferentially non-invasive 
approach.
The initial screening can be made with NAFLD liver fat 
score and Fatty liver index, both estimated from routinely 
available clinical and laboratory data. They have previ￾ously been correlated with liver fat content [69, 70] and 
may help in patient selection for conventional US, which 
is the currently recommended method to detect steatosis 
by the guidelines [5, 6].
Once steatosis is confirmed, TE quantification of ste￾atosis could be provided with the CAP parameter. The 
steatosis degree can be graded as mild, moderate and 
severe [61]. Importantly, some clinical variables as race, 
BMI, and T2D are known to affect this image-based 
method and further adjustments are needed to improve 
its accuracy [74]. In addition, TE is a valuable tool for 
detection of fibrosis, an important prognostic marker 
of liver disease. The LSM parameter of TE significantly 
increases according to fibrosis stage, discriminating 
significant (F2–F4) and severe (F3–F4) fibrosis [63]. 
At this point, the use of non-invasive simple indexes 
as FIB-4, APRI and NFS can be associated and offers 
a good performance for ruling out or staging fibrosis 
[65]. Moreover, these indexes are the most consistent 
for identifying fibrosis progression or regression before 
and after an intervention [75].
Methods based on MRI, including MRE, are accu￾rate for liver fat quantification, and promising to 
detect changes in fibrosis stage during the follow-up. 
The high cost and lack of availability are limitations of 
these methods. MRE may be recommended in selected 
cases, when the TE has lower accuracy, for instance in 
patients with ascites or severe obesity [74].
Despite the limitations of liver biopsy, we highlight 
it is the gold-standard method for NASH and fibrosis 
evaluation, and may be considered in selected cases, 
such as suspicion of other liver disease [56, 57].
NAFLD treatment
Treating obesity in patients with NAFLD
Excess body weight is an important cornerstone of 
NAFLD’s pathophysiology, and it is also a critical deter￾minant of adverse clinical outcomes [76]. The new 
MAFLD definition reinforces this concept, since it is 
based on the presence of histological, imaging or blood 
biomarker evidence of hepatic steatosis in combination 
to overweight/obesity [8].
Weight loss has the strongest capacity to induce his￾tological improvement in NASH. The amount of weight 
loss can determine NAFLD outcomes. Even modest 
weight loss of≥3% can improve steatosis, while at least

5% weight loss is needed to improve inflammation and 
hepatic histology [77] and to stabilize fibrosis [78–80]. 
Seven percent or more of weight loss resolves NASH in 
65–90% of patients and improves the NAS [78–80]. Ten 
percent or more, can improve fibrosis, leading to fibrosis 
regression in 45% of patients [77, 79].
There is a dose–response between weight loss and the 
magnitude of histological improvement and, according 
to the NAFLD guidelines, a 7–10% weight loss is the pri￾mary target of most interventions [5, 6].
Diet and exercise
The dietary management in NAFLD should focus on 
caloric restriction, aiming to induce 0.5–1  kg/week of 
weight loss. In general, a low-calorie diet should have 
50–60% of caloric intake from carbohydrates and 20–25% 
from lipids [81, 82]. Saturated fats should account 
for<10% of total fat intake [81, 82].
There is lack of evidence to recommend polyunsatu￾rated fatty acids (PUFA) supplementation in patients 
with NAFLD. Despite some evidence of liver fat improve￾ment on imaging, it failed to show significant histological 
improvement [83–90]. Furthermore, high meal frequency 
can increase the amount of intrahepatic fat and abdomi￾nal fat independent of caloric content and body weight 
gain [81, 82]. Therefore, snacking should be avoided in 
patients with NAFLD [82].
Very low-calorie diets (500–800  kcal/day) have low 
long-term adherence and are not recommended [81, 
82]. The Mediterranean diet, which is rich in monoun￾saturated fatty acids, PUFA and polyphenols, showed 
improvement on insulin sensitivity and hepatic steatosis. 
According to many medical societies, Mediterranean diet 
is an eating pattern of choice in individuals with NAFLD 
[6, 91–94].
In general population with obesity, high protein diets 
may be an option to weight loss and maintenance. A 
high-protein, hypocaloric and high-fiber diet has shown 
a significant reduction of liver fat content and LSM, 
a surrogate marker of liver fibrosis [95–97]. Overall, 
these specific diets may be efficient methods of reduc￾ing caloric intake and have shown promising results in 
observational studies and small randomized controlled 
trials (RCTs) [81, 82]. On the other hand, further studies 
demonstrating histological improvement in NAFLD are 
needed. Type of diet and quantity of kcal restriction per 
day should be individualized, based on comorbidities and 
patient’s preferences.
If diet and exercise fail to achieve the targets in indi￾viduals with NAFLD, the addition of pharmacotherapy 
is recommended in individuals with BMI≥27  kg/m2
, 
since NAFLD is an obesity-related comorbidity [98–100]. 
Some of the approved antiobesity medications were 
investigated in NAFLD patients, including liraglutide, a 
glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA), and 
orlistat.
GLP‑1RAs
GLP-1RAs are very promise drugs for treatment of 
NAFLD. Acting through many mechanisms, these agents 
induce a dose-dependent weight loss, which prob￾ably implies improvement in fatty liver. Moreover, there 
is in  vitro evidence that GLP-1 receptor is present on 
human hepatocytes and its activation by exendin-4 has 
been shown to reduce hepatocyte steatosis [101]. Addi￾tionally, GLP-1RAs can improve hepatic and adipose 
tissue IR and lipid metabolism, and decrease de novo 
lipogenesis, AT lipolysis, hepatic glucose production and 
oxidative stress [102, 103].
Apart from liraglutide, no other GLP-1RA is currently 
approved for the treatment of obesity. Notwithstanding, 
all GLP-1RAs slow gastric emptying, decrease appetite 
and increase postprandial satiety and fullness, beyond 
their insulin-stimulating and glucagon-inhibiting effects 
[104].
Weight loss is one of the mechanisms that could sup￾port GLP-1RAs benefits to NAFLD individuals. Liraglu￾tide 3.0 mg/day has proven to induce 8.0±6.7% of weight 
loss [105] and 63% median rate of achieving at least 5% 
weight loss [106]. Liraglutide also appears to decrease 
metabolic dysfunction, IR and lipotoxicity [102]. There￾fore, some of the beneficial effects of liraglutide on 
NAFLD could be independent of weight loss. In rodents, 
liraglutide prevented the development of NAFLD and 
attenuated the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines 
[107–110].
Some clinical trials evaluating different doses of liraglu￾tide showed positive results on NAFLD, and the major￾ity were performed in people with T2D (as discussed in 
the respective section below). In a 6-month RCT, lira￾glutide (3 mg/day) was shown to be similarly effective as 
the combination of diet and aerobic exercise in reducing 
weight, liver fat content (assessed by MRI) and ALT in 
obese NAFLD patients [111]. Additional larger studies 
using histological endpoints are needed before liraglu￾tide can be recommended for treatment of NAFLD in 
patients with obesity.
Very recently, the result of a phase 2 trial 
(NCT02970942) evaluating the efficacy and safety of 
three different doses of semaglutide vs. placebo in NASH 
was announced by its fabricant [112]. In this press 
release, semaglutide was superior to placebo in attain￾ing the primary endpoint of resolution of NASH and no 
worsening in liver fibrosis, and it is now being evaluated 
for further clinical trial development [112].

Godoy‑Matos et al. Diabetol Metab Syndr (2020) 12:60 Page 9 of 20
Orlistat
Orlistat promotes weight loss by inhibiting gastrointes￾tinal and pancreatic lipases, thus preventing the absorp￾tion of approximately one-third of dietary triglycerides. 
It is associated with an estimated 44% median rate of 
achieving at least 5% weight loss [106]. The excess weight 
loss with orlistat compared to placebo (i.e., weighted 
mean difference for the drug-to-placebo comparison) 
was 2.6 kg (95% CI 2.3–2.9 kg) [106], which is considered 
a mild effect.
Five studies have investigated the effects of orlistat on 
liver endpoints [113–117]. All studies showed improve￾ment in liver fat content, as well as levels of ALT and 
AST, and three studies evidenced improvement in his￾topathology [113, 114, 117], but these changes were not 
superior to other treatments such as lifestyle, sibutramine 
or even placebo [113–117].
Only a 24-week double-blinded, RCT with orlistat 
(n=52) [117] assessed histological endpoints. There 
was a significant decrease in serum transaminases and a 
reversal of liver fat content (assessed by US), but no sta￾tistically significant difference in histological improve￾ment in comparison to placebo [117]. Therefore, orlistat 
may have benefit for NAFLD as it induces weight loss, 
but there is lack of evidence that it is superior to other 
weight loss therapies or that it brings beneficial effects on 
the liver independent of weight reduction.
Bariatric surgery
If the combination of lifestyle modification and pharma￾cotherapy also fails in patients with NAFLD, then bariat￾ric surgery should be considered in selected individuals 
with BMI≥35 kg/m2
, since NAFLD is an obesity-related 
comorbidity [98–100].
The effects of weight loss surgery on NAFLD, includ￾ing sleeve gastrectomy (SG), Roux-en-Y gastric bypass 
(RYGB), and adjustable gastric banding (AGB), have 
been described. In a study comparing RYGB with 
AGB (n=1236), NAFLD improved with both surger￾ies. However, RYGB induced more weight loss (26% 
vs. 21%) and had a better effect on NAFLD, despite 
the greater baseline BMI and the more severe NAFLD 
when compared to AGB group at 1 and 5 years [118]. A 
prospective observational study (n=52) evaluating lap￾aroscopic SG evidenced that 90% of subjects with base￾line NAFLD (assessed by US) achieved its resolution on 
follow-up, and it was correlated with improvement in 
HDL cholesterol levels [119].
In a secondary analysis of an RCT, 72 patients who 
underwent SG or RYGB were identified with histologi￾cal NAFLD using intraoperative liver biopsies [120, 
121]. Those that underwent SG (n=36) had significant 
improvements in AST, ALT and GGT at 12  months, 
which may indicate a greater benefit on liver fat and/or 
inflammation for SG, though follow-up histology was 
not performed [120, 121].
A recent meta-analysis of 21 studies, enrolling 2374 
patients, assessed the resolution of NAFLD after bari￾atric surgery [122].  A high proportion (88%) of the 
subjects improved steatosis and steatohepatitis, and 
30% improved or resolved liver fibrosis. RYGB had a 
greater impact on NAFLD histology when compared 
with other procedures [122]. Although additional data 
is needed to assess the optimal surgical strategies to 
improve NAFLD and to determine its cost-effective￾ness, the available evidence to date suggests that bariat￾ric surgery could be considered as a potential treatment 
for NAFLD.
Treating NAFLD in patients with MetS
Metformin
Several trials evaluated the effect of metformin on 
treatment of NAFLD, but none of them was specifi￾cally designed to evaluate patients with MetS. A recent 
systematic review with 6 RCTs included 573 patients, 
most of them without diabetes (> 90%), with a mean 
BMI 30±2.5 kg/m2
, who were treated for a median of 
9 months [123]. Among the four RCTs including adult 
patients with NAFLD confirmed by biopsy, small ben￾efits were observed on liver steatosis and inflammation, 
but not on fibrosis [123]. A significant reduction was 
observed in serum aminotransferase levels (specially 
ALT), but this effect was not confirmed in another 
series [124, 125].
In the TONIC trial, the use of metformin failed to 
reduce ALT levels and improve liver histology com￾pared with placebo in 173 children or adolescents with 
biopsy-proven NAFLD and without diabetes [125]. 
Similarly, there is no confirmed benefit for the use of 
metformin on liver disease for adults with NASH with 
MetS [123].
Pioglitazone
Pioglitazone, a thiazolidinedione (TZD) insulin sensitizer 
acting through an agonist effect on the peroxisome pro￾liferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ) [31], have 
shown some benefit in RCTs in patients without diabe￾tes. In the PIVENS trial [126], 247 patients with NASH 
and without diabetes were randomized to receive treat￾ment with placebo, pioglitazone (30 mg/day) or vitamin 
E (Vit-E, 800 UI/day) for 2  years [126]. Compared to 
placebo, the rate of improvement in NASH with piogl￾itazone was not significant (34% and 19%, respectively; 
p=0.04). Due to two primary comparisons, a p value 
less than 0.025 was considered statistically significant. 

Godoy‑Matos et al. Diabetol Metab Syndr (2020) 12:60 Page 10 of 20
Notwithstanding, there were significant improvements in 
steatosis (p<0.001) and lobular inflammation (p=0.004). 
If a finding of no worsening of hepatocellular ballooning 
was used, however, NASH improvement with pioglita￾zone became significant (48% vs. 25%, p=0.003). Nota￾bly, the resolution of NASH, a key secondary endpoint, 
was achieved with statistical significance in more patients 
using pioglitazone, when compared to placebo (47% vs. 
21%, p=0.001) [126].
Another RCT with 74 patients with biopsy-proven 
NASH and without T2D showed reduction in liver fat 
content and liver fibrosis after 12 months of use of piogl￾itazone 30 mg when compared to placebo [127].
The benefic effect of TZDs in the treatment of NASH 
were corroborated in a systematic review with 8 RCTs 
using pioglitazone (06 trials) or rosiglitazone (02 trials) 
to specifically treat NAFLD or NASH including 828 indi￾viduals, most of whom (85%) did not have diabetes and 
were treated for a median of 12 months. In comparison 
to placebo or reference therapy, both TZDs significantly 
improved liver fat content and NASH. A significant 
reduction of serum aminotransferase levels was observed 
in most patients treated with TZDs, when compared to 
placebo or reference therapy [123].
A previous meta-analysis demonstrated that in 4 
RCT in patients without diabetes, the use of TZDs was 
associated with improvement in advanced fibrosis (OR 
2.95, 95% CI 1.04–10.90, p=0.02, I
2=0%), improve￾ment in fibrosis of any stage (OR 1.76, 95% CI 1.02–3.03, 
p=0.02, I
2=0%) and NASH resolution (OR 3.40, 95% 
CI 1.95–5.93, p<0.001, I
2=0%). The effects were mainly 
accounted for the use of pioglitazone [128].
Taken together, these results demonstrate the benefic 
effect of pioglitazone in patients with MetS and biopsy￾proven NASH and fibrosis. It is important to remember, 
however, the side effects of TZDs, such as weight gain, 
fluid retention, risk of congestive heart failure, decrease 
of bone mineral density and a higher risk for fractures 
[31]. So, the use of pioglitazone may be considered after 
discussion of risks and benefits with each patient [5].
Vitamin E
The use of Vit-E, a fat-soluble vitamin with antioxidant 
properties, has been investigated in different clinical tri￾als, particularly due to its potential of improvement in 
steatosis, inflammation and resolution of steatohepa￾titis in adults with NASH. In the PIVENS trial, the use 
of Vit-E therapy (800  IU/day) for 2  years achieved the 
primary endpoint improvement in the NAS by 2 or 
more points and no increase in fibrosis when compared 
to placebo (43% vs. 19%, p<0.001; number needed to 
treat=4.4) [126].
Some meta-analyses raised concern about long term 
safety of high doses of Vit-E (>800 IU/day) analyzing all￾cause mortality, prostate cancer and hemorrhagic stroke 
[129, 130]. On the other hand, another large meta-anal￾ysis with 57 trials reported no effect on overall mortality 
with doses up to 5500 IU/day of Vit-E [131]. In summary, 
Vit-E supplementation may be considered for biopsy￾proven NASH in patients without diabetes, after careful 
discussion of risks and benefits of the therapy [5].
Selonsertib and other anti‑inflammatory drugs
The understanding of pathogenic mechanisms involv￾ing NAFLD progression, such as chronic inflammation 
and fibrogenesis in the liver, brought some speculation 
about anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic therapies [132]. 
Selonsertib, an orally bioavailable inhibitor of apoptosis 
signal-regulating kinase 1, and simtuzumab, a humanized 
monoclonal antibody designed for the treatment of fibro￾sis, are examples of these agents [132]. A phase 2 trial 
evaluated the use of selonsertib alone or in combination 
with simtuzumab in patients with NASH and moderate 
to severe liver fibrosis (stage 2 or 3). The trial was termi￾nated after 96 weeks due to lack of efficacy [132].
Treating NAFLD in patients with diabetes
Because NAFLD and T2D have the same pathophysi￾ological origin, it is reasonable to suppose that drugs to 
treat T2D, and the metabolic surgery, have the potential 
to also treat NAFLD. According to Diabetes Guideline of 
the Brazilian Diabetes Society [31], beyond insulin, there 
are eight classes of antidiabetic agents, and all of them 
were tested in the treatment of NAFLD. A brief review of 
these classes of drugs and their mechanisms of action can 
be found in Table 4.
Metformin
According to a systematic review evaluating antidiabetic 
agents for NAFLD [133], there are five RCTs with met￾formin in this context, none of them exclusive in patients 
with T2D. In the study with the highest proportion of 
patients with T2D (27.3%), treatment with metformin 
(2500 mg/day or 3000 mg/day, if body weight was>90 kg) 
or placebo for 6  months did not resulted in significant 
differences for changes in liver steatosis (assessed either 
histologically or by CT), NAS or liver transaminases 
[124].
In summary, metformin did not substantially impact 
NAFLD [133]. Nevertheless, it does not mean that it is 
useless for NASH complications. In a nationwide case–
control study in Taiwanese population, metformin use 
was associated with a decrease in the risk of hepatocel￾lular cancer in a dose-dependent manner [134]. Each 
incremental year of metformin resulted in 7% reduction 

Godoy‑Matos et al. Diabetol Metab Syndr (2020) 12:60 Page 11 of 20
in the risk of hepatocellular cancer in patients with T2D 
followed up for 12–16  years (adjusted OR 0.93, 95% CI 
0.91–0.94, p<0.0001) [134]. In hepatoma cell lines, 
metformin inhibits cell growth through cell cycle G0/
G1 arrest, an effect partially attributed to the activa￾tion of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein 
kinase (AMPK) pathway and its upstream liver kinase B1 
(LKB1), with antiproliferative effects [134].
Thiazolidinediones
TZDs are the glucose-lowering agents most extensively 
explored on NAFLD. Considering the pathophysiology 
of NAFLD, TZDs seem a reliable therapeutic option for 
patients with T2D.
In a proof of concept study, Ravikumar et  al. [135], 
treated 10 T2D patients with 30  mg/day for 16  weeks 
and demonstrated an approximately 50% reduction in 
liver fat content (measured by MRI-S), what significantly 
correlated with decrease in fasting and postprandial 
endogenous glucose production. Interestingly, they also 
observed a decrease in fasting and postprandial gluca￾gonemia. We speculate that pioglitazone, by reducing 
liver fat, favorably interfered with the new described 
liver-α-cell axis [42, 43, 47–53], reducing glucagon and 
contributing to glucose homeostasis.
A systematic review and meta-analysis of six RCTs 
(n=332) evaluated the effect of TZDs (pioglitazone, 
rosiglitazone and troglitazone) vs. placebo or sulfony￾lureas on NAFLD in patients with T2D [136]. TZDs 
significantly decreased 6,6% of liver fat content (95% CI 
−12.56 to −0.96, p=0.022, I
2=0%). In an independent 
trial in patients with prediabetes or T2D and NASH, 
pioglitazone (45  mg/day) also decreased liver fat con￾tent by 54% in comparison to placebo (p < 0.001) [137].
Two trials that conducted liver biopsy in patients 
with prediabetes or T2D and NASH suggested that 
pioglitazone (45  mg/day) improved liver histology of 
steatosis, ballooning necrosis and inflammation, com￾pared with placebo [137, 138]. Only one evidenced a 
significant improvement in fibrosis score with pioglita￾zone for 18 months (p=0.039) [138]. TZDs also seem 
to be effective in improving ALT [136].
Interestingly, in a double-blinded, proof-of-concept 
RCT, Bril et al. [139] tested a combination of pioglita￾zone (45  mg/day) plus Vit-E (400 UI BID) vs. placebo 
or Vit-E in T2D patients with biopsy-proven NASH 
(n=105). The primary histological endpoint of at 
least 2 points reduction in NAS, without any worsen￾ing in fibrosis, was achieved in more patients in com￾bination therapy as compared to placebo (54% vs. 19%, 
p=0.003), but not in the Vit-E group (31% vs. 19%, 
p=0.26). While both groups achieved improvement in 
NASH (combination 43% vs. 12%, p=0.005, and Vit-E 
alone: 33% vs. 12%, p=0.04), ballooning and inflamma￾tion improved in combination group only [139]. Taken 
together, pioglitazone seems to be the best option for 
NASH therapy, at least in T2D patients, and it is incor￾porated in AASLD guidance for NASH therapy in 
patients with or without T2D [5].
Currently, pioglitazone is the only TZD available in 
Brazil. No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with 
mild-moderate liver failure, but pioglitazone should be 
avoided in those with severe liver dysfunction [31].
Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitors (gliptins)
DPP4, also known as adenosine deaminase binding pro￾tein or cluster of differentiation 26 (CD26), is a serine 
exopeptidase able to inactivate various oligopeptides 
through the removal of N-terminal dipeptides [140]. 
The activity of DPP4 seems to be increased in patients 
with T2D and there are a fair number of in  vitro and

in  vivo studies demonstrating that this enzyme can 
interact with proinflammatory pathways [140]. DPP4 
is also an hepatokine [141], and chronic liver diseases, 
including hepatitis C, hepatitis B, NAFLD and hepato￾cellular carcinoma, have been related to elevated levels 
of this enzyme [142].
There is a direct association between DPP4 activity 
and IR in humans [143], and evidence that obesity in 
mice stimulates hepatocytes to synthesize and secret 
DPP4, which acts with plasma factor Xa to promote 
inflammation of AT macrophages and IR [144] (Fig. 1). 
Curiously, silencing expression of DPP4 on hepatocytes 
suppressed inflammation of VAT and IR, but this effect 
did not occur with sitagliptin, an orally administered 
DPP4 inhibitor [144]. Once there are differences in the 
way in which gliptins interact with the DPP4, it may 
impact on the DPP4 inhibitors’ possible ability to miti￾gate inflammation and IR promoted by the hepatocyte￾secreted DPP4 [141].
Clinical trials evaluating DPP4 inhibitors to NAFLD 
in people with T2D are scarce and conflicting. In a study 
involving patients with T2D randomized to vildagliptin 
(50 mg twice a day) or placebo over 6 months, mean fast￾ing liver fat content (assessed by MRI) decreased by 27% 
with vildagliptin, while there was no change in placebo 
group. ALT fell significantly in the vildagliptin group, and 
there was a correlation between the decrements in ALT 
and liver fat content (r=0.83; p<0.0001) [145]. On the 
other hand, an RCT conducted in Chinese patients with 
T2D and NAFLD evidenced no significant changes in the 
average AST and ALT during the 52-week follow-up in 
both the sitagliptin (50 or 100 mg/day) and diet plus exer￾cise groups [146]. To the best of our knowledge, there 
were no studies with DPP4 inhibitors and biopsy con￾firmed NASH.
There are minimal pharmacokinetic changes for DPP4 
inhibitors in patients with varying degrees of liver dys￾function, except for vildagliptin, which is not recom￾mended in patients with ALT or AST levels>2.5 to 3 
times the upper limit of normal [31]. Overall, it seems 
that the effectiveness of gliptins to treat NAFLD, if any, 
appears to be limited in people with T2D.
GLP‑1RAs
Most of the clinical studies evaluating the hepatic ben￾efits of GLP-1RAs in people with T2D are limited to 
the short-acting subcutaneous agents liraglutide and 
exenatide. In an individual patient-level meta-analysis of 
more than 4000 patients with T2D, comparing 26 weeks 
of liraglutide (1.8  mg/day) vs. placebo, liraglutide sig￾nificantly improved liver enzyme concentrations in a 
dose-dependent manner [147]. Furthermore, according 
to a recent systematic review [123], there are only four 
RCTs evaluating the effects of GLP-1RA on NAFLD that 
have included patients with T2D, and only one of them 
included subjects with biopsy-proven NASH [148].
The LEAN trial was a multicentre, double-blind, phase 
2 RCT to assess liraglutide (1.8  mg/day) vs. placebo for 
48  weeks in patients with biopsy-proven NASH (32.6% 
with T2D) [148]. The primary outcome measure was 
resolution of NASH with no worsening in fibrosis from 
baseline to end of treatment. Nine (39%) of 23 patients on 
liraglutide had resolution of NASH compared with two 
(9%) of 22 patients in the placebo group (RR 4.3, 95% CI 
1.0–17.7, p=0.019) [148]. Two (9%) of 23 patients in the 
liraglutide group vs. 8 (36%) of 22 patients in the placebo 
group had progression of fibrosis (RR 0.2, 95% CI 0.1–1.0, 
p=0.04) [148].
In summary, data from RCTs evidences short-acting 
GLP-1RAs seem to reduce serum liver enzymes and 
improve hepatic steatosis, as detected by either imag￾ing techniques or liver histology [123]. Additionally, data 
from a 104-week cardiovascular outcomes trial in T2D 
evidenced the long-acting semaglutide (0.5 or 1.0  mg/
week) significantly reduced ALT and hsCRP in compari￾son to placebo [149].
If larger phase 3 trials will further confirm the promis￾ing findings of the LEAN trial, it is reasonable to hypoth￾esize that GLP-1RAs will become a suitable treatment 
option in NAFLD patients, especially in those with T2D 
[123].
SGLT2 inhibitors
Recent emerging evidence of the use of SGLT2 inhibitors 
in patients with NAFLD and T2D is promising. These 
agents have shown to reduce body weight, decrease levels 
of serum transaminases and improve steatosis and liver 
histology [150]. Empagliflozin, dapagliflozin and canagli￾flozin are the SGLT2 inhibitors currently available in Bra￾zil [31].
A systematic review [151] assessed the effect of SGLT2 
inhibitors on liver enzymes in patients with T2D and 
NAFLD. Data from eight studies (04 RCTs and 04 obser￾vational studies) lasting at least 12 weeks were extracted. 
Almost all (seven) studies showed a significant decrease 
in ALT, and most of the studies evidenced reductions in 
AST and GGT levels [151]. SGLT2 inhibitors were asso￾ciated with significant reduction in liver fat content, and 
among the three studies that evaluated indices of hepatic 
fibrosis, a significant improvement was evidenced in two 
of them [151].
In the real-world E-LIFT trial [152], fifty patients 
with NAFLD and T2D under standard treatment were 
randomly assigned to receive empagliflozin (10  mg/
day) or keep standard treatment without empagliflozin 

Godoy‑Matos et al. Diabetol Metab Syndr (2020) 12:60 Page 13 of 20
for 20  weeks. Empagliflozin reduced liver fat content 
(assessed by MRI) and improved ALT levels, but not 
GGT and AST levels [152]. Furthermore, results from 
RCTs showed a high consistent reduction in aminotrans￾ferases with empagliflozin in individuals with T2D, in a 
pattern (reductions in ALT>AST) that is potentially con￾sistent with a reduction in liver fat content [153]. These 
ALT reductions were largely independent of changes in 
weight or HbA1c [153].
A randomized, active-controlled, open-label trial 
evaluated the use of dapagliflozin (5  mg/day) vs. stand￾ard treatment without SGLT2 inhibitors for 24 weeks in 
patients with T2D and NAFLD. There were significant 
improvements in ALT, GGT and liver stiffness assessed 
by elastography in the dapagliflozin group [154]. Dapagli￾flozin also reduced hepatic steatosis and attenuated fibro￾sis in a subgroup of patients with significant liver fibrosis 
(liver stiffness measurement≥8.0  kPa) [154]. Addition￾ally, the EFFECT-II trial [155] investigated the effects of 
dapagliflozin (10  mg/day), omega-3, and a combination 
of both vs. placebo on liver fat content (assessed by MRI) 
in subjects with T2D and NAFLD for 12 weeks. All active 
treatments significantly reduced liver fat content from 
baseline, but only the combination treatment reduced 
liver fat content (p=0.046) and total liver fat volume 
(p=0.037) in comparison with placebo [155]. Dapagliflo￾zin monotherapy, but not the combination, reduced the 
levels of hepatocyte injury biomarkers, including ALT, 
AST and GGT [155].
A systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs evalu￾ated the effects of canagliflozin (100 or 300 mg/day) on 
liver enzymes in patients with T2D [156]. Eleven stud￾ies placebo-controlled or active-controlled were selected 
(n=6745). Canagliflozin significantly decreased serum 
concentrations of ALT, AST and GGT after 26 and 
52  weeks, suggesting a protective effect on liver [156]. 
Additionally, in a prospective small uncontrolled study, 
nine patients with NAFLD and T2D were subjected to 
liver biopsies at baseline and after 24 weeks of treatment 
with canagliflozin (100  mg/day) [157]. There was histo￾logical improvement in all patients. Scores of steato￾sis, lobular inflammation, ballooning, and fibrosis stage 
decreased by 78%, 33%, 22% and 33% at 24 weeks com￾pared to the pretreatment, respectively [157].
Despite the very promise preliminary results, more 
clinical trials assessing the effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on 
NAFLD in patients with T2D are warranted, especially 
those primarily aimed to investigate the impact in hepatic 
histological features.
Sulfonylurea and glinides
Sulfonylurea and glinides are hypoglycemic drugs used 
to treat T2D. They share similar mechanisms of action, 
through the sulfonylurea receptor (SUR) on the β-cell, 
then stimulating insulin release and improving glycemic 
control [31]. Despite no plausible explanation for bene￾fits of these secretagogues in NAFLD treatment beyond 
improvement in diabetes control, sulfonylureas were 
active comparators in few studies evaluating other anti￾diabetic drugs in this context and, in general, seems to be 
inefficient or less efficient than these other drugs on liver 
fat [136, 158, 159].
There are two RCTs in patients with T2D, respectively 
evaluating the effects of a sulfonylurea (gliclazide) and a 
glinide (nateglinide) on NAFLD, to be highlighted. In a 
24  weeks clinical trial, 87 subjects were randomized to 
receive gliclazide, metformin, or liraglutide for 24 weeks. 
Primary outcomes included liver fat content, assessed by 
US, and liver function. All treatment groups resulted in 
significant decreased of these outcomes, but gliclazide 
resulted in less improvement compared with liraglutide 
and metformin [159]. Moreover, a very small study con￾sisting in 10 subjects on diet and exercise therapy for 
T2D and biopsy-proven NASH, randomly distributed to 
nateglinide (270 mg/day) or no additional treatment, evi￾denced significative improvements in ALT, abdominal US 
and CT imaging tests and liver histological findings with 
nateglinide for 18 months [160].
α‑Glucosidase inhibitors
Inhibitors of the intestinal enzyme α-glucosidase reduce 
postprandial glycemia by decreasing glucose absorption. 
Acarbose is the only α-glucosidase inhibitor currently 
available in Brazil [31].
Data are very scarce on the effect of acarbose to treat 
NAFLD. Histological benefits were evidenced in two 
experimental studies combining acarbose and ezetimibe 
in animal models of IR [161, 162]. In a subgroup analy￾sis of a small clinical trial, involving subjects with an 
elevated hepatic fat content assessed by MRI-S, liver fat 
content was reduced in 26% under acarbose treatment 
(300 mg/day) for 12 weeks [163]. Nonetheless, no defini￾tive conclusion can be drawn from this first human data 
due to small observation sizes.
Despite limited evidence of acarbose for NAFLD, the 
results of a double-blind cross-over study evaluating 
the safety and efficacy of acarbose (300 mg/day) vs. pla￾cebo for 24 weeks suggest it may be used for the treat￾ment of T2D in patients with well-compensated liver 
cirrhosis [164].

Metabolic surgery
Several gastrointestinal operations and bariatric pro￾cedures promote improvement (and even remission) 
of MetS [165] and T2D [166]. In the ensuing years, 
the concept of “metabolic surgery” or “diabetes sur￾gery” has become widely recognized, and most major 
worldwide bariatric surgery societies have changed 
their names to include the word “metabolic” [166, 167]. 
According to a joint statement by international diabe￾tes organizations [166], metabolic surgery should be 
recommended to treat T2D in patients with class III 
obesity (BMI ≥ 40 kg/m2
) and in those with class II obe￾sity (BMI 35–39.9 kg/m2
) when hyperglycemia is inad￾equately controlled by lifestyle and optimal medical 
therapy. Surgery should also be considered for patients 
with T2D and BMI 30–34.9  kg/m2
 if hyperglycemia is 
inadequately controlled despite optimal treatment with 
either oral or injectable medications [166]. These rec￾ommendations do not consider the presence of NAFLD.
While some authors argue that NAFLD should be 
considered a comorbidity that lowers the BMI threshold 
for metabolic surgery to 35 kg/m2
 [168], the American 
Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery recom￾mends that surgical treatment should be offered as an 
option for suitable patients with BMI 30–35 kg/m2
 and 
obesity related co-morbidities, including NAFLD, who 
do not achieve substantial, durable weight loss and co￾morbidity improvement with reasonable nonsurgical 
methods [169].
To date, the only study evaluating NAFLD remis￾sion after metabolic surgery including patients with 
class I obesity was the one conducted by Berry et  al. 
[170]. This retrospective cohort study included 252 
patients with BMI 30–35 kg/m2
 and at least one asso￾ciated comorbidity, such as NAFLD (n=69) and/or 
T2D (n=10). Over 3 years of postoperative follow-up, 
NAFLD (assessed by US) remitted in 84.6%, and T2D 
remitted in 60% and improved in 40% [170]. It was not 
clear, however, how many patients had both conditions 
at baseline. Therefore, the role of metabolic surgery to 
treat NAFLD in patients with T2D and class I obesity 
remains uncertain.
Considering NAFLD as a continuum, its treatment 
interventions according to patients’ profile are summa￾rized in Table 5.

Conclusions
NAFLD is metabolically related with AT insulin resist￾ance, limited expandability, and dysfunctionality [37, 38]. 
A fatty liver is a main driver for a new recognized liver￾pancreatic α-cell axis and increased glucagon [42, 43, 47–
53], putatively contributing to diabetes pathophysiology.
Patients with obesity and/or MetS, with or without 
T2D, might be targeted promptly for ruling out NAFL/
NASH and fibrosis [3, 5, 6].
Treatment of the NAFLD spectrum is better accom￾plished with lifestyle measures, what may be associated 
with some drugs [3, 5, 6]. Weight loss of 7%-10% or more 
may revert steatosis and NASH [5, 6]. Liraglutide 3 mg/
day can be considered a valuable option to treat obesity 
and consequently ameliorate NAFLD [111]. Bariatric sur￾gery should be considered for those with a BMI≥35 kg/
m2
 [98–100, 166, 168].
Among several drugs herein discussed, pioglitazone is 
the only recommended in specialized societies guidelines 
for the treatment of NAFLD [3, 5, 6]. Vit-E has showed 
histological improvements in patients without diabetes 
[5, 126], but specific trials are warranted in T2D.
GLP-1RAs are a probable fruitful class of agents due 
to their weight loss effects as much as some metabolic 
driven actions [102, 103, 107–111, 123, 147–149]. SGLT2 
inhibitors have demonstrated some benefits in surrogate 
endpoints but need histological data [150–157]. Com￾bination therapy (e.g., pioglitazone plus GLP-1RA and/
or SGLT2 inhibitor) has never been studied and it is an 
avenue to be explored.
