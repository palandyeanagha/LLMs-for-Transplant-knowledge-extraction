Tregs are important mediators of immune tolerance to self antigens, and it has been suggested that Treg
inactivation may cause autoimmune disease. Therefore, immunotherapy approaches that aim to restore or
expand autoantigen-specific Treg activity might be beneficial for the treatment of autoimmune disease. Here
we report that Treg-mediated suppression of autoimmune disease can be achieved in vivo by taking advan￾tage of the ability of the liver to promote immune tolerance. Expression of the neural autoantigen myelin
basic protein (MBP)in the liver was accomplished stably in liver-specific MBP transgenic mice and transiently
using gene transfer to liver cells in vivo. Such ectopic MBP expression induced protection from autoimmune
neuroinflammation in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis. Protection from autoimmunity was mediated by
MBP-specific CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ Tregs, as demonstrated by the ability of these cells to prevent disease when
adoptively transferred into nontransgenic mice and to suppress conventional CD4+CD25– T cell prolifera￾tion after antigen-specific stimulation with MBP in vitro. The generation of MBP-specific CD4+CD25+Foxp3+
Tregs in vivo depended on expression of MBP in the liver, but not in skin, and occurred by TGF-β–dependent
peripheral conversion from conventional non-Tregs. Our findings indicate that autoantigen expression in the
liver may generate autoantigen-specific Tregs. Thus, targeting of autoantigens to hepatocytes may be a novel
approach to prevention or treatment of autoimmune diseases.
Introduction
Immune tolerance to self antigens is maintained by multiple
mechanisms that control potentially pathogenic autoreactive
lymphocytes, including deletion, clonal anergy, or suppression
by Tregs (1–3). Autoimmune disease may thus result from insuf￾ficient control of autoreactive lymphocytes (4, 5), and a major
goal of immunotherapy for autoimmune diseases is the induc￾tion of tolerance to autoantigens by restoring regulation (6).
A particularly promising way to restore self tolerance seems to
be the manipulation of autoantigen-specific CD4+CD25+Foxp3+
Tregs; adoptive transfer of these cells can prevent autoimmune
or inflammatory conditions (6–10). In vivo, the majority of Tregs
seems to be generated in the thymus (8); however, these cells may
also be generated in the periphery (9, 10). Indeed, increasing evi￾dence suggeststhat peripheral Tregs can be generated not only by
peripheral expansion of thymic Tregs(11, 12), but also by de novo
conversion from conventional CD4+Foxp3– T cells (13–16). So
far, however, it is not clear how the therapeutic potential of spe￾cific Treg generation in the periphery can be translated into clini￾cally applicable therapies.
The microenvironment of the liver favors immune tolerance,
presumably by a combination of tolerogenic antigen-presenting
cells and cytokines (17–20). We therefore hypothesized that one
approach to the induction of peripheral control of autoreactive
lymphocytesisthe ectopic expression of autoantigen in the liver. To
test our hypothesis,we used an animal model forthe human neuro￾inflammatory disease multiple sclerosis, EAE, which is marked by
CD4+ T cell–mediated inflammation of the central nervoussystem
and ascending paralysis (21, 22). EAE was induced in susceptible
B10.PL mice by autoimmunization to myelin basic protein (MBP)
(21, 22). In B10.PL mice, which carry the H-2u MHC haplotype, the
encephalitogenic epitope of MBP is the aminoterminal acetylated
nonameric peptide Ac1–9. Because the native Ac1–9 peptide is a
poor MHC class II binder (23), we used a modified MBP in which
the lysine at position 4 was replaced by tyrosine; this substitution
causes greatly increased affinity to MHC class II molecules and
thus more efficient lymphocyte activation (23). Ectopic expres￾sion of MBP in the liver was achieved by constitutive expression
in transgenic mice that express the MBP transgene under con￾trol of the hepatocyte-specific human C-reactive protein (CRP)
promoter (CRP-MBP mice; ref. 24). We also generated transgenic
mice expressing MBP under control of the skin-specific keratin 5
(K5) promoter (K5-MBP mice) as controls (25). Alternatively, ecto￾pic MBP expression in the liver was achieved by transient gene
expression in hepatocytesin vivo, induced either by hydrodynamics￾Nonstandard abbreviations used: CRP, C-reactive protein; K5, keratin 5; MBP,

based gene transfer, which targets about 40% of all hepatocytes
(26), or by adenoviral gene transfer (27).
We found that hepatic tolerance induced generation of MBP￾specific Tregs and protection from EAE. Treg generation was thy￾musindependent, required ectopic expression of MBP in the liver,
and occurred by conversion from conventional CD4+CD25– T cells.
Our findings indicate that the targeted expression of autoantigen
in hepatocytes may be a novel therapeutic approach to induce
autoantigen-specific CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ Tregs in vivo for the pre￾vention and treatment of autoimmune diseases.
Results
To achieve ectopic expression of MBP in the liver, we generated
CRP-MBP transgenic mice of FVB/N strain background express￾ing the 18.5-kDa isoform of MBP under control of the hepato￾cyte-specific CRP promoter; as a control, we generated K5-MBP
transgenic mice that show ectopic MBP expression in the skin.
Indeed, the CRP-MBP mice manifested strong expression of the
transgene in the liver and weak transgene expression in the thy￾mus (Figure 1A); the K5-MBP mice manifested strong transgene
expression in both skin and thymus (Figure 1B). To establish sus￾ceptibility to EAE, the CRP-MBP and K5-MBP mice were bred with
susceptible B10.PL mice, and EAE was induced in the respective
F1 generations. After immunization with Ac1–9, the CRP-MBP
F1 mice were protected from EAE (maximal EAE score, 0.5 ± 0.2;
Figure 1C); the nontransgenic littermates, in contrast, developed
severe EAE (maximal score, 3.5 ± 0.6; P < 0.05). Brain histology at

zation) revealed that the nontransgenic mice manifested marked
infiltrates of inflammatory cells, most notably macrophages and
T cells, whereas CRP-MBP mice were free of cellularinfiltrates(Fig￾ure 1D). In contrast to that of CRP-MBP mice, the severity of EAE
induced in K5-MBP mice (maximal score, 3.4 ± 0.5) was similar to
that in nontransgenic littermates(maximalscore, 3.1 ± 0.5; Figure
1E). Thus, ectopic expression of MBP in the liver, but not in the
skin, was associated with resistance to EAE induction.
We then asked whether transient expression of the MBP autoan￾tigen in the liver could likewise induce protection from EAE in sus￾ceptible wild-type mice. We thus performed in vivo hydrodynam￾ics-based MBP gene delivery to hepatocytes of adult nontransgenic
mice. At 2 weeks after transfection with MBP-encoding plasmid
or empty control plasmid, mice were immunized with Ac1–9 to
induce EAE. Mice treated with control plasmid developed severe
EAE (maximal score, 3.0 ± 0.8); in contrast, mice treated with
MBP-encoding plasmid were protected from EAE (maximal score,
0.5 ± 0.2; P < 0.05; Figure 1F). To confirm this observation, we also
performed adenoviral gene transfer with an MBP-encoding vec￾tor or a control adenoviral vector containing the lacZ gene and,
2 weeks after gene transfer, immunized with Ac1–9 to induce
EAE. Adenoviral MBP gene transfer induced resistance to EAE
induction (maximal score, 0.3 ± 0.3), whereas mice that received
the control vector developed severe EAE (maximal score, 3.2 ± 0.4;
P < 0.05; Figure 1G). Thus, protection from EAE was even induced
by transient expression of MBP autoantigen in the liver.
To determine whether the suppression of EAE associated with
ectopic MBP expression in the liver was mediated by clonal dele￾tion of encephalitogenic T cells, we crossed CRP-MBP mice to
homozygous T cell receptor transgenic Tg4 mice, which express
an encephalitogenic H-2u–restricted Vβ8.2+ T cell receptor that
recognizes Ac1–9 (28). The resulting CRP-MBP×Tg4 double￾transgenic mice manifested peripheral CD4+Vβ8.2+ T cells at
numbers similar to those of Tg4 single-transgenic littermates
(Figure 2A). Thus, the encephalitogenic T cells had not been
deleted in CRP-MBP mice. Nevertheless, after immunization to
Ac1–9, the CRP-MBP×Tg4 mice were protected from EAE (maxi￾mal score, 0.6 ± 0.16), in contrast to FVB/N×Tg4 mice (maximal
score, 3.2 ± 0.3; P < 0.0001; Figure 2B). This protection from
EAE was also not caused by downregulation of autoreactive T
cell receptors (29): T cells from CRP-MBP×Tg4 mice had surface
expression of CD4 and Vβ8.2 similar to that of T cells from FVB/
N×Tg4 mice (Figure 2A). Thus, the MBP-specific T cells of CRP￾MBP mice were not different from those of nontransgenic mice
in frequency or T cell receptor expression.
Next, we investigated whether protection from EAE in CRP-MBP
mice is mediated by active suppression. We adoptively transferred
106 spleen cells from CRP-MBP mice into nontransgenic mice;
as a control, we transferred 106 splenocytes from nontransgenic
mice. Mice that received splenocytes from CRP-MBP donors were
protected from EAE (maximal score, 0.5 ± 0.2), whereas mice that
received splenocytes from nontransgenic donors were not pro￾tected and developed EAE symptoms (maximal score, 3.0 ± 0.4;
P < 0.05; data not shown). To further characterize the cell type
that transferred resistance to EAE, we sorted splenocytes from
CRP-MBP mice according to their staining for CD4 and CD8 and
transferred 105 cells of the CD4+, CD8+, or CD4–CD8– fractions
into nontransgenic recipient mice. CD4+ cells from CRP-MBP
mice (maximal score, 1.0 ± 0.4), but not from nontransgenic mice
(maximalscore, 3.3 ± 0.6), transferred resistance to EAE effectively;
transferred CD8+ or CD4–CD8– cells from CRP-MBP mice did not
protect from EAE (maximal score, >3.0; P < 0.005; Figure 3A).
In order to determine whether protection from EAE by trans￾ferred CD4+ T cells depends on CD4+CD25+ Tregs, we sorted
splenic CD4+ T cells from CRP-MBP mice into a CD25+ fraction
and a CD25– fraction and transferred 105 cells of each fraction into
wild-type recipient mice, which were subsequently immunized to
MBP. While transfer of CD4+CD25+ T cells protected from EAE
(maximal score, 0.5 ± 0.2), transfer of CD4+CD25– T cells did not
(maximal score, 3.3 ± 0.4; P < 0.05; Figure 3B). Thus, protection
from EAE in CRP-MBP mice was conferred by a CD25+ fraction
of splenic CD4 T cells. We then confirmed that the protective
CD4+CD25+ T cells were indeed Tregs by demonstrating their
expression of Foxp3 (Figure 3C).
Because tolerance to peripheral autoantigens can be induced by
their thymic expression (30), and the CRP-MBP mice manifested
weak thymic expression of the transgene (Figure 1A), we therefore
investigated whetherthe protective CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ Tregsfrom
CRP-MBP mice are generated in the thymus or in the periphery.
First, we bypassed thymic tolerance induction by neonatal thymec￾tomy of CRP-MBP mice, followed by engraftment of embryonic
thymus from nontransgenic mice and — after 6.5-Gy irradiation
— reconstitution with bone marrow from nontransgenic mice. As
a control, the same procedure was performed in nontransgenic
mice. The thymectomized CRP-MBP mice were protected from
EAE (maximal score, 0.3 ± 0.2), but the thymectomized nontrans￾genic mice developed severe EAE (maximalscore, 3.3 ± 0.5; P < 0.05;
Figure 3D). Thus, protection from EAE did notseem to depend on
expression of MBP in the thymus. To confirm this interpretation,
we isolated thymic CD8–CD4+CD25+ Tregs from the thymus of
CRP-MBP or nontransgenic mice, transferred 105 thymic Tregs
into nontransgenic recipients, and assessed the cells’ potential to
suppress EAE. Thymic Tregs from both CRP-MBP and nontrans￾genic mice were inefficient in suppression of EAE (maximal score,
>3.0; Figure 3E). Since 105 peripheral Tregs (Figure 3B), but not
105 thymic Tregsfrom CRP-MBP mice (Figure 3E), efficiently pro￾Figure 2

tected from EAE, it is highly unlikely that the protective Tregs were
induced in the thymus.
To further confirm that the protective Tregs in CRP-MBP mice
were generated in the periphery rather than in the thymus, we iso￾lated naive CD4+CD25–CD62Lhigh T cells from the spleens of Tg4
mice (>99% Foxp3–), labeled these cells with CFSE, and transferred
2 × 106 CFSE+CD4+CD25– T
cells into nontransgenic or
CRP-MBP mice (Figure 4A).
At 7 days after transfer, we
reisolated the CFSE+ T cells
from spleens and livers of the
recipient mice (Figure 4B)
and further transferred the
recovered CFSE+ Tg4 T cells
into nontransgenic recipients
(2 × 104 cells/mouse), which
were then immunized with
Ac1–9 to induce EAE (Figure
4A). We transferred only those
CFSE+ cells that could be cer￾tainly distinguished from the
endogenous CFSE– cells by
their fluorescence intensity,
i.e., cells that underwent no
more than 5 divisions (Figure
4B). The recipients of Tg4 T
cells that were placed in non￾transgenic mice developed
severe EAE (maximal score,
3.4 ± 0.2), whereas the Tg4 T
cells placed in CRP-MBP mice
conferred protection from
EAE (maximal score, 1.4 ± 0.3;
P < 0.05; Figure 4C). Thus, the
transferred naive CD4+ Ac1–9–
specific T cells appeared to
acquire the ability to sup￾press EAE by passage through
CRP-MBP mice. Peripheral
generation of Tregs is known
to occur by conversion from
conventional CD4+CD25– T
cells (9); thus, to confirm that
the protective CFSE+ T cells
obtained by passage through
CRP-MBP mice were gener￾ated by conversion to Tregs
in vivo, we analyzed their
Foxp3 expression. Indeed, the
CFSE+ cells recovered from
CRP-MBP mice, but not from
nontransgenic mice, exhibited
increased Foxp3 expression
(8.1% and 1%, respectively;
Figure 4D). Foxp3 staining of
the CD4+CFSE– T cells served
as internal staining control.
Because, unlike thymic Treg
generation, the peripheral
conversion of Tregs from conventional T cells critically depends
on TGF-β (9), we sought to confirm that the conversion of naive
CFSE+ T cellsto protective CFSE+Foxp3+ T cellsin CRP-MBP mice
was TGF-β dependent. Therefore, we isolated CD4+CD25–Vβ8.2+
T cells from the spleens of Tg4×hCD2-ΔkTβRII F1 mice, which
manifest impaired TGF-β signaling (31). After labeling with CFSE

dye, the TGF-β–insensitive T cells were transferred to nontrans￾genic mice or CRP-MBP mice, recovered from spleens and livers
after 7 days, and analyzed for Foxp3 expression (Figure 4E). In
contrast to the TGF-β–responsive T cells (Figure 4D), the TGF-β–
insensitive T cells did not acquire marked Foxp3 expression when
transferred to nontransgenic or CRP-MBP mice (1.3% and 1.6%,
respectively; Figure 4E). These findings indicate that MBP expres￾sion in the livers of CRP-MBP mice inducesthe conversion of con￾ventional MBP-specific T cells to Foxp3+ Tregs and that this con￾version is dependent on TGF-β. However, the transferred CFSE+
T cells apparently were not efficiently stimulated to proliferate in
nontransgenic mice, as indicated by the absence of CFSE dilution
in contrast to the evident proliferation of CFSE+ T cells that were
transferred to CRP-MBP mice (Figure 4, D and E). It was possible
that a lack of stimulation could explain the absence of conver￾sion to Foxp3+ Tregs in nontransgenic mice. Therefore, we stud￾ied whether transfer of naive CFSE+ Tg4 T cells to K5-MBP mice
could induce proliferation and Foxp3 expression (Figure 4F). The
CFSE+ T cellstransferred to K5-MBP mice were stimulated in vivo,
as indicated by the dilution of CFSE (51% nonproliferated cells,
compared with 53% after transfer to CRP-MBP mice; Figure 4D;
and 88% aftertransferto nontransgenic mice; Figure 4F). However,
CFSE+ T cellsthat were transferred to K5-MBP mice did not exhib￾it increased Foxp3 expression compared with those transferred to
nontransgenic mice (0.7% and 0.4%, respectively; Figure 4F). Thus,
the in vivo conversion of CFSE+ T cells to Foxp3+ Tregs was not
induced by their peripheral stimulation unless the stimulating
antigen was expressed in the liver.
Although these findingsindicated that ectopic expression of MBP
in the liverinduced the conversion of conventionalTcellsintoTregs,
therewas no apparent general increase in Treg numberin CRP-MBP
mice.Indeed,the frequency ofCD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T cells(about 9%)
did not significantly differ between CRP-MBP and nontransgenic
mice. Thus, it was possible that the frequency of MBP-specific Tregs
or their suppressive activity was selectively increased in CRP-MBP
mice. To confirm that MBP expression in the liver induces selec￾tive expansion of MBP-specific Tregs, we compared the capacity of
CD4+CD25+ T cells from CRP-MBP mice to suppress the effector
responses of T cellsfrom Tg4 mice with that of nontransgenic litter￾mates(Figure 5).Tregsfrom CRP-MBP micewere as effective asTregs
from nontransgenic mice in suppressing conventional CD4+CD25–
effector T cellsin response to nonspecific stimulationwith antibody
to CD3 (Figure 5A). In contrast, as few as 5 × 103 Tregs from CRP￾MBP mice completely suppressed the proliferation of 105 effector
T cells after Ac1–9 stimulation, whereas at least 5 × 104 Tregs from
nontransgenic mice were required to obtain a similar degree of sup￾pression (Figure 5B).These findingsindicate that MBP expression in
the liverinduced a selective increase in MBP-specific Treg activity.
Discussion
Immunotherapy for autoimmune disease aims at restoring a state
of tolerance to the self antigens that drive autoimmune disease.

Ourfindingsindicate that the targeted expression of autoantigens
in liver cells may be a novel approach to induce active tolerance
to autoantigens, which may serve as therapy for autoimmune dis￾ease. Indeed, ectopic expression of MBP in liver, but not in skin,
suppressed subsequent EAE induction, even when expressed tran￾siently (Figure 1). This protection was not mediated by clonal dele￾tion (Figure 2), but by peripheral Tregs (Figure 3), which seemed
to be generated by de novo TGF-β–dependent conversion from
conventional CD4+CD25– T cells (Figure 4), resulting in selective
expansion of MBP-specific Treg activity (Figure 5).
How exactly these Tregs were induced by autoantigen expression
in the liveris currently not clear. However, it is unlikely that central
tolerance was involved in protection from EAE, because (a) tran￾sient MBP expression in liver induced protection; (b) there was no
apparent deletion orreceptor downregulation (Figure 2); (c) neona￾talthymectomy did not abrogate protection (Figure 3D); (d)thymic
Tregs did not confer protection (Figure 3E); (e) K5-MBP mice were
not protected (Figure 4F); and (f) peripheral TGF-β–dependent
conversion from conventional T cellsinduced protective Tregs(Fig￾ure 4). Nevertheless, we cannotformally prove thusfarthatthe
conversion to Tregs was induced by cells in the liver, although
it is clear that suppression of neuroinflammation occurred
only when neural autoantigen was ectopically expressed in the
liver, not in the skin (Figures 1 and 4).
The liver contains various cell types that can interact with
CD4+ T cells and have known abilities to regulate immune
responses, mostly by way of immune deviation. These cell
types include Kupffer cells (32, 33), sinusoidal endothelial
cells (19, 20), hepatic stellate cells (34, 35), and hepatocytes
(36, 37). Although it was previously shown that some hepatic
cell types can regulate the suppressive activity of Tregs (38),
it is thus far not known whether any of these cells are able to
convert non-Tregs to Tregs. However, hepatocytes, to which
expression of the autoantigen was targeted, do not express
MHC class II molecules constitutively (36); thus, it is possible
that not hepatocytes themselves, but instead another type of
antigen-presenting cell in the liver or in the draining lymph
nodes, induced the conversion to Tregs after sequestration of
MBP released from the hepatocytes.
Regardless of what cell type induced the conversion to Tregs,
there are indications that the mechanisms of liver-induced
conversion could be distinct from those of nonhepatic conver￾sion. First, this conversion appeared to withstand contextual
inflammation in response to adenoviral gene delivery (Figure
1G). Notably, adenoviral infection is associated with increased
interleukin-6 levels, and interleukin-6 is known to abrogate
TGF-β–dependent conversion in favor of generating Th17 cells
(39). Second, atleastin vivo,the liver-induced conversion into Tregs
appeared to involve notinitial clonal expansion, butratherimmedi￾ate acquisition ofthe phenotypic Treg marker Foxp3, even in nonex￾panded cells(Figure 4D). Therefore,the celltypes and molecularsig￾nalsresponsible for hepatic conversion of non-Tregsto Tregsshould
be furtherinvestigated. Indeed, elucidating the mechanisms of Treg
generation by hepatic antigens may also help to explain the causes
of tolerance loss in autoimmune liver disease; the liver can be the
target of various aggressive autoimmune diseases of as yet unknown
etiologies. Impaired TGF-β signaling in T cells has previously been
found to increase the susceptibility to autoimmune hepatitis (31);
here, we found that the liver-induced conversion of conventional
T cells to Tregs was TGF-β dependent (Figure 4E). Thus, the sus￾ceptibility to autoimmune liver disease may be related to defective
hepatic generation of Tregs. Indeed, a relative Treg deficiency has
been reported to occur in patients with autoimmune liver disease
(40, 41). However, such flawed generation of Tregs may only pre￾dispose — not cause — autoimmune liver disease; itremains unclear

Tregs of CRP-MBP and nontransgenic mice showed an equal 
capacity to suppress after nonspecific stimulation with antibody 
to CD3. (B) Tregs from CRP-MBP mice showed greatly increased 
efficacy to suppress after being stimulated with Ac1–9 compared 
with Tregs from nontransgenic mice, indicating selective expan￾sion of MBP-specific Tregs in CRP-MBP mice. Percentages indi￾cate the proportion of cells that did not proliferate (black peaks).

what brings about the differentiation and activation of autoaggres￾sive lymphocytesin autoimmune liver disease.
It has previously been reported that antigen-specific Tregs may
also be expanded by neurons in vivo (42), or by antigen-pulsed
dendritic cellsin vitro (43). Although itremainsto be seen whether
these prior approaches or the one described here can be developed
into practical therapiesfor human autoimmune disease, the meth￾od of Treg expansion described here may be promising because
gene delivery to hepatocytes is becoming a realistic therapeutic
option (27). Moreover, the MBP-specific Tregs induced by hepatic
MBP expression featured extraordinary suppressive efficacy, both
in abrogating the proliferation even of a 20-fold excess of MBP￾stimulated conventional T cellsin vitro (Figure 5) and in suppress￾ing EAE in vivo after the transfer of as few as 2 × 104 converted
T cells (Figure 4). Of note, even transient hepatic expression of
autoantigen induced robust control of autoreactive lymphocytes
(Figure 1, F and G). Thus, targeting of autoantigen expression to
the liver may indeed be an attractive approach to induce active
tolerance to autoantigens and protect from autoimmune disease,
and the usefulness of this approach to serve as therapy for human
autoimmune disease should be explored.
Methods
Mice. All mice were bred and kept in a specific pathogen–free animal facility
at Johannes Gutenberg University (Mainz, Germany) or at the University
Medical Centre Hamburg-Eppendorf. The experiments were approved by
the institutional review boards Bezirksregierung Rheinhessen (Neustadt,
Germany) and Behörde für Soziales, Familie, Gesundheit, und Verbrauch￾erschutz (Hamburg, Germany). Complementary DNA encoding a MBP
splice variant of 18.5 kDa, in which the lysine at position 4 was replaced
by tyrosine, was generated by PCR with the following primers: sense,
5′-ACCCCCGGGATGGCATCACAGTACAGACCCTCA-3′; antisense,
5′-ACCCCCGGGTCAGCGTCTCGCCATGGGAGATCC-3′.CRP-MBPmice
were generated according to standard procedures(44) by microinjection of
the generated complementary DNA constructs ligated to the human CRP
promoter (24) into fertilized FVB oocytes. Of the 5 founder lines obtained,
4 expressed MBP in the liver and showed protection from EAE. As control,
K5-MBP mice were generated by ligating the MBP construct to the K5 pro￾moter (25); 2 founder lines were obtained that expressed MBP in the skin.
Alternatively, ectopic expression of MBP in mouse liver was achieved by
hydrodynamics-based gene transfer of MBP gene, cloned into pcDNA3.1
plasmid (Invitrogen) as described previously (26), or by adenoviral gene
transfer of MBP gene cloned into a type 5 adenoviral vector, provided by
J. Prieto (University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain).
EAE induction. Age- and sex-matched mice were inoculated subcutane￾ously at the base of the tail with 200 μg Ac1–9 (Sigma-Aldrich) in 0.1 ml of a
sonicated emulsion of an equal volume of complete Freund’s adjuvant and
PBS containing 4 mg/ml heat-killed Mycobacterium tuberculosis,strain H37RA
(Difco). One day afterimmunization, 200 ng pertussistoxin (Sigma-Aldrich)
was administered intraperitoneally in 0.5 ml PBS. Thereafter, EAEwas mon￾itored daily for up to 30 days. The severity of EAE was scored as follows:
1, flaccid tail; 2, partial hindlimb paralysis and impaired righting reflex;
3, total hindlimb paralysis; 4, fore- and hindlimb paralysis; 5, moribund.
Histopathology and immunohistochemistry. For histopathological analysis of
the CNS, brain and spinal cord sections were stained with Luxol Fast Blue
or immunostained with the indicated rat monoclonal antibodies and bio￾tinylated secondary antibody (GE Healthcare) followed by ExtrAvidin-Per￾oxidase (Sigma-Aldrich) and developed with DAB (Sigma-Aldrich) accord￾ing to the manufacturers’ instructions.
Adoptive transfer of T cell subsets. Purified CD4+ and CD8+ or CD4+CD25+
T cells from the spleens of MBP transgenic mice or nontransgenic mice
were separated by MACS (Miltenyi) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions; the purity of the separated cells was above 95% as controlled
by a FACSscan or FACScanto (BD Biosciences). CD4+CD25–CD62Lhigh
non-Tregs or CD4+CD25–Vβ8.2+ T cells were obtained with the MultiSort
MACS kit from Miltenyi and were greater than 99% Foxp3–, as controlled
by fluorescence-activated cellsorting. CD4+CD8–CD25+ thymic Tregs were
obtained by sorting in a FACSaria (BD Biosciences). Cell populations were
then suspended in PBS and injected intraperitoneally on the day of EAE
induction. CFSE+ cells were obtained by presorting for CD4 expression by
MACS, followed by CFSE sorting in a FACSaria (BD Biosciences).
T cell suppressor assays. Suppressor assays were performed essentially as
described previously (45). Proliferation was determined by CFSE labeling
of effector T cells, detected by flow cytometry, as described previously (45).
Foxp3 staining was determined by flow cytometry with APC-labeled Foxp3
antibody (eBioscience).
Statistics. A P value less than 0.05 was considered significant. Statisti￾cal significance of differences between data sets was determined by the
Mann-Whitney test.
