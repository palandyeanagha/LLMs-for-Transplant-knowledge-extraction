ABSTRACT
SUMMARY: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with a severe inflammatory response. Inflammation affects athero￾sclerotic plaque vulnerability and promotes a thrombogenic environment. We report a series of 6 patients with COVID-19 with
acute ischemic stroke due to intraluminal carotid artery thrombus presenting during an 8-day period. Six patients were included (5
men) with a mean age of 65.8 years (range, 55–78 years). COVID-19 was diagnosed by detection of Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome coronavirus 2 in 5 patients and was presumed due to typical clinical and imaging findings in 1 patient. All patients had
vascular risk factors including diabetes (83%), hyperlipidemia (100%), and smoking (17%). Four patients presented with large infarcts
with initial NIHSS scores of 24–30. During their hospitalization, all patients had elevated D-dimer and C-reactive protein levels, 5
patients had elevated lactate dehydrogenase and ferritin levels, 3 had elevated interleukin-6 levels, and 2 had elevated troponin
levels. Inflammation related to COVID-19 may result in rupture of vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques, resulting in thrombosis and
acute ischemic stroke.
ABBREVIATIONS: COVID-19 ¼ coronavirus disease 2019; ICT ¼ intraluminal carotid artery thrombus; IL-6 ¼ interleukin-6; LVO ¼ large-vessel occlusion;
SARS-CoV-2 ¼ Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2
Since emerging in late 2019, the Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and associated coro￾navirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have rapidly progressed to a
global pandemic. Current understanding suggests that COVID￾19 causes an excessive immune response, resulting in inflamma￾tion and extensive tissue damage.1 Those patients who develop
severe disease have been found to have significantly elevated lev￾els of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and other inflammatory cytokines in
what is termed a “cytokine storm.”
2 This pattern of severe inflam￾mation is of concern in the realm of vascular neurology because
previous coronavirus and influenza epidemics have demonstrated
an increased risk of cardiovascular complications.3 These findings
were attributed primarily to the substantial inflammatory
response along with localized vascular inflammation.3,4 More
recent studies have also found that flulike illnesses increase the
odds of cerebral infarction by nearly 3-fold during the initial 15
days, with inflammation again identified as a potential culprit.5
A specific subtype of acute ischemic stroke, large-vessel
occlusion (LVO), is characterized by occlusion of a major
extracranial (carotid or vertebral artery) or intracranial vessel
and represents 24%–38% of all acute ischemic strokes when
defined as blockage of the intracranial ICA, M1, M2, A1, ver￾tebral artery, P1, or basilar artery.6 One important cause of
LVO is artery-to-artery embolism, usually due to the presence
of an atherothrombotic plaque or thrombosis at the site of a
plaque rupture. Of particular concern are atherosclerotic pla￾ques that are considered vulnerable, meaning those that have
a high probability of undergoing rupture and causing local
thrombosis and embolism. Plaque vulnerability is determined,
in part, by plaque morphology, which is influenced by patho￾physiologic mechanisms occurring at the cellular and molecu￾lar levels.7 One factor that has been reported to have a key
role in promoting plaque vulnerability is inflammation, which
can lead to thinning of the fibrous caps, enhanced influx of
lipids and expansion of the lipid core, as well as increased
neoangiogenesis.8
Cerebral infarction related to supracardiac atherosclerosis and
subsequent thromboembolism is an increasingly recognized
cause of embolic stroke.9 A 2019 meta-analysis found atheroscler￾otic plaques with high-risk features to be 5 times more prevalent
in the ipsilateral compared with the contralateral carotid artery in

embolic stroke of underdetermined source.10 Nevertheless, iden￾tification of intraluminal carotid artery thrombus (ICT) is less
common. In the North American Symptomatic Carotid
Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET),11 the frequency of ICT was
only 1.1% in symptomatic patients with ,70% stenosis versus
4.3% and 5.5% in patients with $70% and .85% stenosis, respec￾tively.12 While ICT can occur in patients with and without signifi￾cant atherosclerotic disease, in patients without underlying
carotid stenosis, ICT is often associated with a hypercoagulable
state.12
In the context of the current pandemic, initial reports have
indicated that fewer patients are seeking emergency care for
stroke symptoms, possibly to avoid exposure to the coronavirus.
Despite an overall reduction in our total institutional stroke vol￾umes, we noted an unusually high number of patients with
COVID-19 who presented during 8 days with strokes due to ICT
within the proximal internal carotid artery lumen. We present
the clinical presentation, laboratory studies, and imaging findings
of 6 such patients.
Case Series
Institutional review board approval with waived consent was
obtained for this Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
Act–compliant retrospective Clinical Report. The case series con￾sists of patients with COVID-19 presenting with acute cerebral
infarction with varying degrees of intraluminal clot within the
internal carotid artery. Patients were selected from those admit￾ted to a large comprehensive stroke center. COVID-19 was diag￾nosed via detection of SARS-CoV-2 with real-time reverse
transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay performed on
specimens obtained via nasopharyngeal or nasal swabs. One
patient with real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain
reaction negative for SARS-CoV-2 but with high suspicion for
COVID-19 was also included. That patient had a clinical pre￾sentation and laboratory findings typical of COVID-19, as well
as chest CT findings of bilateral subpleural consolidative opac￾ities and a large region of ground-glass opacity, which fit the
typical appearance of COVID-19 pneumonia according to
the Radiological Society of North America Expert Consensus
Statement.13 Laboratory values reported include peak levels
during the hospitalization course, as well as peak levels within
the 24 hours before or after initial identification of ICT on
imaging. This is a descriptive study reporting the imaging and
clinical characteristics of this series of patients.
Six patients were included (5 men, 1 woman) with a mean
age of 65.8 years (range, 55–78 years) (Table). All patients had a
history of vascular risk factors, including diabetes (83%), hyper￾lipidemia (100%), and smoking (17%). Four patients presented
with large infarcts with initial NIHSS scores ranging from 24 to
30. Four patients (67%) presented with tandem occlusions iden￾tified on CTA. One patient received IV alteplase, and 2 patients
underwent mechanical thrombectomy with TICI reperfusion
scores ranging from TICI 2a to TICI 2b. With regard to
COVID-19 status, 4 patients (67%) had previous symptoms
consistent with COVID-19 ranging from 4 to 14 days before the
onset of infarction. Two patients (33%) presented with cerebral
infarction and later developed respiratory symptoms. One
patient tested negative for COVID-19 via nasal swab but was
treated as positive for COVID-19 on the basis of clinical, radio￾graphic, and laboratory findings.
During their hospitalization course (On-line Table), all
patients (100%) had elevated D-dimer and C-reactive protein
levels, 5 (83%) had elevated lactate dehydrogenase and ferritin
levels and reduced absolute lymphocyte counts, and 2 (33%)
had elevated troponin levels. In addition, of the 4 patients with
IL-6 levels tested during their hospitalization, 3 (75%) had ele￾vated levels. Within the 24 hours before or after ICT detection
on imaging, of those tested, levels of D-dimer, C-reactive pro￾tein, and lactate dehydrogenase were elevated in 100% (5/5
patients tested), absolute lymphocyte counts were reduced in
67% (4/6), ferritin was elevated in 60% (3/5), fibrinogen was
elevated in 50% (2/4), and troponin was elevated in 40% (2/5).
In addition, of the 3 patients who underwent IL-6 testing dur￾ing that timeframe, 100% (3/3) had elevated levels. Four
patients were significantly debilitated on discharge with mRS
scores of 4–5, and 2 patients were discharged with mild deficits
(mRS, 1–2).

status, right hemiplegia, and global aphasia with an initial
NIHSS score of 24. Noncontrast CT demonstrated early ische￾mic changes involving the left thalamus and putamen. CTA
showed near-occlusion of the left ICA at the bifurcation due
to a large intraluminal clot with complete occlusion more dis￾tally and reconstitution at the supraclinoid segment (Fig 1).

underwent mechanical thrombectomy of the carotid bifurca￾tion and supraclinoid ICA with removal of a large clot and a
final TICI 2a reperfusion grade.
Patient 2. A 78-year-old woman presented with a 1-week his￾tory of fatigue, anorexia, headache, and respiratory distress.
Following admission with bilateral air space opacities sugges￾tive of multifocal pneumonia, the patient’s condition stabi￾lized and she was weaned off supplemental oxygen. The next
morning the patient was found to be mute and hemiplegic on
the right with an initial NIHSS score of 25. Noncontrast CT
demonstrated evolving ischemic changes in the left caudate
nucleus, putamen, and left frontal and parietal cortices (Fig
2). CTA demonstrated an irregular plaque at the left ICA
bifurcation and intraluminal clot extending superiorly. The
patient did not receive thrombolytic therapy because she was
outside the treatment window of 4.5 hours. She did not
undergo mechanical thrombectomy because no LVO was
present on CTA.
Patient 3. A 62-year-old man with a history of diabetes and
hypertension presented with sudden-onset left-sided weakness.
On arrival, the patient was noted to be hypoxic requiring oxygen
supplementation, and his physical examination was notable for
left hemiplegia and dysarthria with an initial NIHSS score of 25.
Noncontrast CT demonstrated an acute infarct involving the
right frontal and temporal lobes. CTA demonstrated complete
occlusion of the right ICA from its origin with reconstitution at
the paraclinoid segment. Distally, there was occlusion of the
mid-to-distal M1 segment of the right MCA. The patient did
not receive thrombolytic therapy because he was discovered
18 hours after symptom onset, and mechanical thrombectomy
was not performed due to a large established infarct on noncon￾trast CT.
Patient 4. A 74-year-old man with a medical history of hyper￾tension, chronic kidney disease, and type 2 diabetes presented
with altered mental status and hypoxia. On examination, the
patient had a mild right facial droop and hemiparesis, with an
initial NIHSS score of 5. Noncontrast CT demonstrated no
acute abnormality. CT angiography showed thrombus in the
right carotid bulb extending into the proximal right internal
carotid artery. The patient underwent emergent carotid
endarterectomy.
FIG 1. Patient 1. A 55-year-old man with COVID-19 and an NIHSS score of 24. A and B, Coronal reformatted and axial images from CT angiogra￾phy of the head and neck demonstrate an irregular plaque at the left internal carotid artery bifurcation (arrowhead) and nonopacification of
the high cervical and petrous (short arrow) left internal carotid artery from tandem occlusion, with reconstitution of the supraclinoid segment
(long arrow). C, CT angiography 3 years prior shows moderate focal stenosis of the left paraclinoid ICA (white arrow). D, CT perfusion map
shows a large volume of hypoperfusion (time-to-maximum . 6 seconds) involving the left anterior and middle cerebral artery territory and a
considerably smaller volume of presumed core infarct (CBF of ,30%) in the left parietal region. E, Digital subtraction angiography of the left in￾ternal carotid artery demonstrates an eccentric filling defect of the left carotid bifurcation (black arrow) and left ICA occlusion, with recanaliza￾tion at the level of the left ophthalmic artery from external-to-internal carotid collaterals (double black arrow).

Patient 5. A 59-year-old man presented with sudden-onset
speech changes. The physical examination was notable for slurred
speech and an initial NIHSS of 1. Noncontrast CT demonstrated
hyperdensity involving the M2 segment of the right MCA. CTA
confirmed occlusion of an M2 segment branch of the right MCA
in addition to a noncalcified low-density filling defect along the
wall of the right ICA immediately distal to the bifurcation, con￾sistent with a ruptured atherosclerotic plaque with adherent
thrombus. The patient was treated with IV alteplase, resulting in
improvement of the neurologic deficits. MR imaging demon￾strated an acute infarct involving the right frontal, temporal, and
parietal lobes.
Patient 6. A 67-year-old man with a medical history of hyperlip￾idemia presented with fever and sudden loss of consciousness.
On examination, the patient had left-gaze deviation, dense left
hemiplegia, and aphasia with an initial NIHSS of 30. Noncontrast
CT revealed a hyperdense left MCA, but otherwise no acute
process (Fig 3). CTA showed near-occlusive ruptured plaque and
thrombus in the left ICA origin, along with complete occlusion of
the M1 segment of the left MCA. CT perfusion demonstrated is￾chemic penumbra and core infarct volumes of 159 and 36 mL,
respectively. The patient underwent mechanical thrombectomy
of the carotid bifurcation and supraclinoid ICA with a final TICI
2b reperfusion grade after removal of 2 separate clots. The
patient’s physical examination findings following intervention
were notable for improvement in language but continued right
hemiplegia and dysphagia.
DISCUSSION
These cases demonstrate 6 patients with COVID-19 (5 con￾firmed, 1 presumed) presenting with acute ischemic infarction.
Each patient had evidence of ICT within the proximal internal
carotid artery, most likely secondary to plaque rupture fol￾lowed by thrombus formation and subsequent artery-to-artery
FIG 2. Patient 2. A 78-year-old woman with COVID-19 and an NIHSS score of 25. A, CT of the head without contrast demonstrates an evolving
ischemic infarct in the left frontoparietal paracentral cortex (dotted circle) with a smaller infarct posteriorly in the left parietal cortex. B–D,
Axial, coronal, and curved reformatted images from CT angiography of the head and neck demonstrate an irregular plaque at the left internal
carotid artery bifurcation and an intraluminal filling defect (arrow) extending superiorly in the left internal carotid artery, corresponding to rup￾tured plaque with clot formation.

embolism. There is evidence that inflammation promotes the de￾velopment of atherosclerosis and is also associated with plaque
rupture.14 The Canakinumab Anti-Inflammatory Thrombosis
Outcome Study noted that patients who received an IL-1 inhibi￾tor had significantly decreased levels of IL-6 and reduced rates of
myocardial and cerebral infarction.15
We suspect that in our cases, the proinflammatory state
caused by COVID-19 infection contributed to plaque instability
and rupture, with subsequent thrombosis promoted by the
thrombogenic environment also caused by the ongoing COVID￾19 infection. There is evidence suggesting that cytokine storms
play a role in cases of severe COVID-19; and for some patients,
this inflammatory state, coupled with the thrombogenic environ￾ment, may play an important role in clot formation and subse￾quent infarction. All patients in this series had a history of
vascular risk factors, including diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and
smoking, which may have increased their susceptibility to plaque
rupture and thrombosis.
Notably, all 6 patients presented with no-or-mild COVID￾19 symptoms, and 5 of the 6 patients (83%) presented with
stroke symptoms as the chief symptoms. This suggests that
even mild cases of COVID-19 can result in thrombogenicity,
inflammation, and ultimately plaque rupture and thrombosis.
In previous studies examining complications related to coro￾navirus-related diseases, most complications were seen in
critically ill patients.16,17 However, the fact that most of our
patients had milder COVID-19 symptoms suggests that a
contributing factor may be a direct effect of the SARS-CoV-2
infection rather than systemic inflammation alone or a post￾infectious prothrombotic state.
Viral infections are known to have the potential for causing
vascular disease, including through atherogenesis, endothelial
activation leading to altered coagulation and fibrinolytic systems,
as well as direct endothelial cell invasion.18 In addition, recent
studies have found evidence of direct infection of the endothe￾lium by SARS-CoV-2 with diffuse endothelial inflammation, fur￾ther supporting the role of the virus in these cases.19 The fact that
all patients presented with involvement at the carotid bifurcation
may be due to its pre-existing propensity for atherosclerosis and
turbulent flow; the latter can damage the endothelium and lead
to platelet aggregation.
The limitations of this study include the inability to prove
causality between COVID-19 infection and ICT due to the retro￾spective nature of the study and the small number of patients.
Additionally, there was neither consistent assessment of the same
systemic inflammatory markers in all patients nor pathologic
confirmation of the embolic material or carotid plaque. Finally,
baseline and follow-up arterial wall imaging beyond CTA was
not performed.
Our findings suggest that there is an increased risk of LVO
due to ICT in patients with COVID-19 infection who have typical
vascular risk factors. Additionally, our patients most often pre￾sented with symptoms of cerebral ischemia rather than typical
COVID-19 symptoms. Furthermore, cerebral ischemia due to
ICT was not limited to patients with severe COVID-19 symp￾toms. The possible coincidence of cerebral ischemia due to ICT
and COVID-19 infection is an essential consideration, particu￾larly in the evaluation of encephalopathy, which is common
with viral illnesses. This recognition is important to ensure that
an appropriate diagnostic work-up is performed, including
