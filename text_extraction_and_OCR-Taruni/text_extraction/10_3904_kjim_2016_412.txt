INTRODUCTION
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most com￾mon cause of cancer-related death worldwide [1]. Sur￾gical resection is the standard treatment for early-stage 
HCC. However, many cases are unsuitable for resection 
or ablative treatments because of severe concurrent cir￾rhosis or advanced HCC [2]. In such cases, radiotherapy 
(RT) and transarterial chemoembolization are consid￾ered as secondary treatments [3,4]. Previously, RT has 
been infrequently performed due to the relatively low 
tolerance of the whole liver to RT [5]. Technological 
advances have made it possible for high doses of radi￾ation to conform to the target volume safely [6,7]. Ste￾1

Background/Aims: The aim of this study was to investigate parameters that pre￾dict radiation-induced liver disease (RILD) following stereotactic body radiother￾apy (SBRT) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and to identify the 
clinical significance of RILD.
Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 117 HCC patients 
who were treated by SBRT from March 2011 to February 2015. RILD was defined 
as elevated liver transaminases more than five times the upper normal limit or a 
worsening of Child-Pugh (CP) score by 2 within 3 months after SBRT. All patients 
were assessed at 1 month and every 3 months after SBRT.
Results: Median follow-up was 22.5 months (range, 3 to 56) after SBRT. RILD was 
developed in 29 of the 117 patients (24.7%). On univariate analysis, significant pre￾dictive factors of RILD were pretreatment CP score (p < 0.001) and normal liver 
volume (p = 0.002). Multivariate analysis showed that CP score was a significant 
predictor of RILD (p < 0.001). The incidence of RILD increased above a CP score 
of 6 remarkably. The rate of recovery from RILD decreased significantly above a 
CP score of 8. Survival analysis showed that CP score was an independent prog￾nostic factor of overall survival (p = 0.001). 
Conclusions: CP score is a significant factor to predict RILD in patients with 
chronic liver disease. RILD can be tolerated by patients with a CP score ≤ 7. How￾ever, careful monitoring of liver function is needed for patients with a CP score 7 
after SBRT.

reotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) allows for delivery 
of a high dose of radiation in a few fractions to HCC by 
image-guided radiation therapy accompanied by a high 
degree of accuracy in target delineation. SBRT has been 
used to treat patients with small HCC who are not eli￾gible for surgery, radiofrequency ablation, or liver trans￾plantation [8].
Radiation-induced liver disease (RILD) is a significant 
limiting factor in the use of RT because there is no ef￾fective treatment for RILD. Predictors of RILD have not 
been well established yet. Definition and terminology 
describing RILD or hepatic toxicity resulting from HCC 
treatment vary among studies [9-12]. Predictive factors 
for RILD also differ depending on the precise defini￾tion used, radiation method, and type of cancer. Some 
authors have reported that dose-volumetric parameters 
are important in predicting the development of RILD 
[6,13,14]. However, others emphasized that clinical fac￾tors could predict the development of RILD [7,9,15,16].
Most patients with HCC have preexisting cirrhosis or 
hepatitis, which may significantly increase the risk of 
RILD [6]. Information about RILD in chronic liver dis￾ease patients remains limited and the predictive factors 
for RILD have not been validated, particularly for SBRT.
Therefore, the aim of our study is to identify factors 
that could be used to predict RILD in patients with HCC 
who were treated with SBRT and to evaluate the clinical 
significance of RILD.
METHODS
Patients
Patients who were treated with SBRT for primary HCC 
were registered in this study. Data collected between 
March 2011 and February 2015 in Soonchunhyang Uni￾versity Cheonan Hospital were retrospectively reviewed. 
The inclusion criteria were as follows: primary HCC, 
pretreatment Child-Pugh (CP) class A or B, HCC with 
no evidence of major vascular invasion, no evidence of 
extrahepatic spread and follow-up time ≥ 3 months. One 
hundred and thirty-nine patients were registered in this 
study. Of these 139 patients, 22 were excluded because 
they had double primary cancer (four patients), fol￾low-up time < 3 months (six patients), major vascular in￾vasion (nine patients), or extrahepatic spread (three pa￾tients). The remaining 117 patients were finally enrolled. 
This study was approved by the Institutional Review 
Board of Soonchunhyang University Cheonan Hospital 
(IRB number: 2015-08-013-001). This study was approved 
by the Institutional Review Board of Soonchunhyang 
University Cheonan Hospital (IRB number: 2015-08-013-
001) and written informed consent was waived because 
of the retrospective study.
SBRT procedure
During the four-dimensional (4D) computed tomog￾raphy (CT) simulation, patients were immobilized in 
supine position with arms above the head. Respira￾tion-correlated 4D CT scans were performed during 
quiet free breathing using a real-time position manage￾ment system (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA, 
USA) and a 16-slice CT scanner (Brilliance CT Big Bore, 
Philips Medical Systems, Cleveland, OH, USA) with slice 
thickness of 0.2 cm. CT series were sorted according to 
respiratory phase from 0 to 90, each of which reflecting 
10% of the respiratory cycle. 
Gross tumor volume (GTV) was measured based on 
visible gross tumor as seen on CT images at the end-ex￾piratory phase fused with multiphase MR images. Ex￾tension based on movement within the gating phase 
(30% to 70%) from the GTV was set as the internal tar￾get volume (ITV). The planning target volume (PTV) 
was defined as the volume with a 5 mm margin added 
to the ITV. SBRT was planned using coplanar and/or 
non-coplanar photon beams with energies of 6 or 15 MV 
(Eclipse V8.9, Varian Medical Systems). Total dose ad￾ministered was 40 to 60 Gy (median, 55) at the PTV in 
three to five fractions over consecutive days or twice a 
week. The chosen isodose covering PTV was between 85 
to 95%, which was normalized to the center of the PTV. 
Treatment was delivered using a Novalis Tx system 
equipped with an On-Board Imager (OBI; Varian Med￾ical Systems) and a highdefinition multileaf collimator 
consisting of 120 leaves including 2.5 mm central and 
5 mm peripheral leaves (Varian Medical Systems; and 
BrainLab, Feldkirchen, Germany). Image guidance with 
cone beam CT was performed prior to the administra￾tion of each fraction of SBRT using the OBI.
Definition and evaluation of RILD
RILD was defined as elevated liver transaminases more 

1095

https://doi.org/10.3904/kjim.2016.412 www.kjim.org
than five times the upper normal limit or worsening 
of CP score by 2 or more within 3 months after SBRT 
[17]. CP score was confirmed on two consecutive visits at 
least 1 month apart before RT [18]. Recovery from RILD 
was defined as decrease of CP score or normalization 
of hepatic enzymes to pre-SBRT level within 6 months 
after development of RILD. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) re￾activation and worsening liver function related to other 
causes was excluded from RILD. 
The clinical parameters analyzed were gender, age, CP 
score, HBV, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT), and alcohol use. Dose-volu￾metric parameters analyzed were normal liver volume 
(NLV), GTV, PTV, SBRT dose, dose per fraction, and 
NLV after receiving > 5 (V5
), 10 (V10), 15 (V15), 20 (V20), 25 
(V25), 30 (V30), 35 (V35), 40 (V40), 45 (V45), 50 (V50), 55 (V55), or 
60 Gy (V60) radiation therapy. NLV was the total liver vol￾ume (TLV) minus the GTV of HCC.
All patients were examined during SBRT to assess 
acute toxicity. After treatment, the patients were fol￾lowed up every 1 to 3 months. Physical examinations, 
complete blood counts, biochemical profiles, tumor 
markers, and three-phasic CT scan or magnetic reso￾nance imaging scan for liver were performed at every 
follow-up visit. 
Statistical analysis 
Chi-square, Fisher exact test, or Student t test were 
performed for univariate analysis of an association be￾tween different variables and the risk of RILD. One-way 
analysis of variance was used for comparing more than 
three variables. In multivariate analysis, binary logistic 
regression model was constructed with all parameters 
that were significant in univariate analysis. A linear by 
linear association model was used to identify the prob￾ability of RILD according to increase in CP score. Cox 
proportional hazards regression analysis was used to 
predict the risk factor for survival. A p < 0.05 was consid￾ered significant. All statistical analyses were performed 
using SPSS version 18.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
RESULTS
Patient characteristics
One hundred and seventeen patients were evaluated. 
The median follow-up period after completion of SBRT 
was 22.5 months (range, 3 to 56). RILD was observed in 29 
of the 117 patients (24.7%) after SBRT. Worsening of CP 
score by 2 was observed in 26 of these 29 patients (89.6%). 
Elevation of liver transaminases to more than five times 
the upper normal limit was observed in three of the 29 
patients (10.4%). The most common etiologies of HCC 
were HBV (55.5%) and alcohol use (27.3%). Baseline char￾acteristics of these patients are summarized in Table 1.
Variables for the risk of RILD
In the univariate analysis, significant predictive factors 
of RILD included pretreatment CP score (p < 0.001) and 
NLV (p = 0.002). Age, gender, HBV, alcohol use, AST, 
ALT, SBRT dose, dose per fraction, GTV, and PTV did 
not influence the possibility of RILD. Dosimetric char￾acteristics (V5
, V10, V15, V20, V25, V30, V35, V40, V45, V50, V55, 
and V60) showed no correlation with RILD (Table 2). In 
multivariate logistic regression analysis, only pretreat￾ment CP score was found to be significantly associat￾ed with RILD (p < 0.001). More RILD cases occurred as 
CP score increased (CP score 6 [CP-A6]: odds ratio [OR], 
7.615; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1.882 to 30.819; p = 
0.004) (CP score 7 [CP-B7]: OR, 16.500; 95% CI, 3.852 to 
70.672; p < 0.001) (CP score ≥ 8 [CP ≥ B8]: OR, 115.500; 95% 
CI, 13.090 to 3,020.514; p < 0.001) (Table 3).
Relationship between RILD and CP score
According to the linear by linear association model, the 
probability of RILD was positively correlated with an in￾crease in pretreatment CP score (p < 0.001). The incidence 
of RILD after SBRT was 5.7% (four of 70 patients) in pa￾tients with a CP score of 5 (CP-A5), 31.6% (six of 19 pa￾tients) in patients with CP-A6, 50.0% (seven of 14 patients) 
in patients with CP-B7, 83.3% (10 of 12 patients) in patients 
with CP score 8 (CP-B8), and 100% (two of two patients) 
in patients with CP score 9 (CP-B9). The incidence of 
RILD increased remarkably above CP-A6. The recovery 
rate from RILD also decreased as pretreatment CP score 
increased (p < 0.001). The recovery rate from RILD was 
100% (four of four patients) in patients with CP-A5, 50.0% 
(three of six patients) in patients with CP-A6, 42.9% (three 
of seven patients) in patients with CP-B7, 0% (0 of 10 pa￾tients) in patients with CP-B8, and 0% (0 of two patients) 
in patients with CP-B9. The recovery rate from RILD de￾creased significantly above CP-B8 (Fig. 1).

Change in liver function after SBRT
We evaluated changes in CP score during 6 months after 
SBRT. Results are shown in Fig. 2. Of the 117 patients, 
10 patients were excluded because another treatment 
for HCC was performed within 6 months after SBRT. 
Change in CP score after SBRT became larger with an in￾crease in the CP score (p < 0.001). The change in CP score 
was 0.27, 0.68, 1.29, 2.2, and 2.5 points in patients with 
CP-A5, CP-A6, CP-B7, CP-B8, and CP-B9 at 3 months, 
respectively. Changes in CP score in patients with CP￾A5 and CP-A6 were less than 1 point. The CP score was 
improved slightly at 6 months after SBRT (5.27 to 5.22 in 
patients with CP-A5 and 6.68 to 6.53 in patients with CP￾A6). In patients with CP-B7 and CP-B8, no improvement 
of CP score was observed at 6 months after SBRT (8.29 to 
8.36 in patients with CP-B7 and 10.2 to 10.33 in patients 
with CP-B8). In two patients with CP-B9, the CP score at 
6 months could not be evaluated because both of them 
died of hepatic failure. 
Relationship between RILD and survival
In the Cox proportional hazard model, sex, presence 
of RILD, CP score, dose per fraction, and NLV had 
prognostic significance for survival. Prognostic factors 
identified by univariate analysis were analyzed by mul￾tivariate analysis. Only CP score was an independent 
prognostic factor affecting the overall survival on multi￾variate analysis (CP-A6: hazard ratio (HR), 0.942; 95% CI, 
0.513 to 1.729; p = 0.847) (CP-B7: HR, 1.578; 95% CI, 0.770 
to 3.236; p = 0.001) (CP ≥ B8: HR, 5.161; 95% CI, 1.986 to 
13.409; p = 0.005) (Table 4). Of 117 patients, a total of 30 
died during the follow-up period. Patients who died of 
hepatic failure due to RILD were analyzed. Two of the 
29 RILD patients (6.8%) died of hepatic failure within 6 
months after the onset of RILD. Death related to RILD 
occurred only in patients with CP-B9.
DISCUSSION
SBRT has been critical in improving local control or as 
a potential cure in patients with small HCC as an al￾ternative treatment [8]. Although SBRT has a good local 
control rate, the risk of RILD still remains uncertain. 
RILD has long been reported as one of the most seri￾ous treatment-related complications for patients who

undergo hepatic irradiation [5]. However, predictors of 
RILD have not been well established yet. The precise 
definition of RILD in patients with HCC who have un￾derlying liver disease varies somewhat between stud￾ies. Recently, RILD has been divided into “classic” and 
“non-classic” types [17]. Classic RILD is subacute hepatic 
toxicity that presents with anicteric ascites, hepatomeg￾aly, and elevated alkaline phosphatase levels; it typically 
occurs between 4 and 8 weeks after the completion of 
RT. Non-classic RILD is defined as elevated liver trans￾aminases more than five times the upper normal limit 
or worsening of CP score by 2 or more. In our study, 
RILD was defined according to the non-classic criteria 
because non-classic RILD was found in patients with 
underlying chronic liver disease such as cirrhosis or vi￾ral hepatitis [19]. In this study, RILD occurred in 29 of 
the 117 patients. However, classic RILD did not occur at 
all. These results were consistent with those of previous 
studies showing that non-classic RILD was observed in 
patients with chronic liver disease [13,20].
Our results showed that only pretreatment CP score 
was significantly associated with the development of 
RILD. Previous studies have also reported that pretreat￾ment liver function was an important factor in predict￾ing RILD [9,16]. According to Jung et al. [9], the risk of 
liver toxicity was high in cases of CP class B. Cardenes et 
al. [16] have reported that CP score is the only factor re￾lated to liver toxicity greater than grade 3. The severity of 
liver cirrhosis is an important clinical predictor of RILD.

0.27, 0.68, 1.29, 2.2, and 2.5 at a CP score of 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 at 3 
months, respectively.

Prior published reports have shown that patients with 
CP class B have a high risk of developing RILD [9,15,21]. 
However, patients with CP-B7, CP-B8, and CP-B9 would 
not have the same liver function although all of them are 
in CP class B. In our study, we analyzed the probability 
of RILD with an increase in CP score. The probability 
of RILD was positively correlated with an increase in 
CP score (p < 0.001) (Fig. 1). Moreover, RILD developed 
more often in CP-A6 patients than in CP-A5 patients 
(31.6% vs. 5.7%, p < 0.001) (Table 2). This suggests that it 
is necessary to distinguish CP-A5 and CP-A6 from the 
perspective of RILD development. Previous studies have 
shown that CP-A6 patients have worse liver function 
due to inflammation and fibrosis [22] and poor over￾all survival [23] compared to CP-A5 patients. Therefore, 
patients with CP-A6 have high risk of developing RILD 
compared to patients with CP-A5.
We also examined the recovery rate from RILD after 
SBRT with increased the CP score. Only CP-A5 patients 
recovered completely from RILD. The recovery rate 
from RILD was moderate in patients with CP-A6 (50%) 
and CP-B7 (42.9%). However, the recovery rate from 
RILD was significantly lower in CP ≥ B8 patients: 0% in 
CP-B8 patients and in CP-B9 patients (Fig. 1). We con￾cluded that RILD was not tolerable in CP ≥ B8 patients 
because the risk of RILD was high and the recovery rate 
from RILD was low. Several studies have reported that 
liver toxicity is not tolerable in CP ≥ B8 patients. Huer￾tas et al. [24] have suggested that liver toxicity is moder￾ate in CP score ≤ 7 (CP ≤ B7) patients and that only these 
patients should be deemed eligible for SBRT. A prospec￾tive study has suggested that the only factor associated 
with more than grade 3 or greater liver toxicity or death 
within 6 months was CP score 8 or greater (p = 0.030) 
[16]. Andolino et al. [25] also have suggested that previous 
liver function (CP ≥ B8) is a limiting factor for toxicity.

We could predict that SBRT would influence the liver 
function. However, there are few studies on how liver 
function changes after SBRT. Tse et al. [26] have suggest￾ed that the most clinically significant change after SBRT 
is a downward change in CP classification from A to B 
in patients with HCC. In this study, we evaluated the 
change in liver function at 3 and 6 months after SBRT 
and found that the decline in liver function was signifi￾cant in CP ≥ B7 patients. Changes in liver function in pa￾tients with CP-A5 and CP-A6 were very minimal. Their 
liver function was improved at 6 months after SBRT. In 
patients with CP-B7, change in the CP score was more 
than 1 point. However, CP class remained CP class B 
without downward change. Especially, deterioration 
of liver function was severe in patients with CP ≥ B8. 
Their CP class was progressed from CP class B to class 
C (Fig. 2). These results suggest that patients with CP-A5 
and CP-A6 could tolerate the damage caused by SBRT. 
In patients with CP-B7, there is a need to monitor liver 
function carefully and adjust dose per fraction and total 
dose. According to Fig. 1 and 2, it would be appropriate 
to consider that hepatic reserve function significantly 
varies from CP-A5 to CP-B9.
In several previously reported studies, RILD has 
been associated with dose-volumetric factors. Son et al. 
[13] have reported that TLV receiving a dose < 18 Gy is 
a predictive factor for RILD, which was defined as CP 
progression or grade 2 or higher hepatic toxicity. The 
study of Liang et al. [14] has found that the percentage of 
TLV exceeding 20 Gy irradiation (V20) is an independent 
dose-volume histogram predictor for RILD after SBRT. 
Another study also has reported that V30 is correlated 
with the occurrence of radiation-induced hepatic toxic￾ity after three-dimensional conformal RT [27]. However, 
our study showed that dose-volumetric parameters, such 
as V20 and V30, could not predict RILD after SBRT. The 
mean NLV was smaller in the patients who had RILD 
than in those who did not have RILD (971.23 ± 297.90 cm3
vs. 1,236.01 ± 332.93 cm3
, p = 0.002). In multivariate analy￾sis, NLV did not predict RILD. Results of study indicated 
that clinical factors were more influential than dose-vol￾umetric factors in the development of RILD because 
most patients had chronic liver disease such as viral hep￾atitis and liver cirrhosis with relatively small irradiated 
target volume (mean PTV, 38.76 ± 19.08 cm3
).
The relationship between RILD and survival has not 
been validated. A previous study has reported that RILD 
after SBRT could influence survival. Liang et al. [14] and 
Son et al. [28] have reported that the presence of RILD 
can shorten the median survival time. However, in our 
study, the presence of RILD was not relevant to over￾all survival. Only CP score was significantly related to 
overall survival. Although the presence of RILD was not 
relevant to overall survival, the development of RILD in 
patients with poor liver function (CP ≥ B8) appeared to 
be a clinically significant factor that could affect overall 
survival because most CP ≥ B8 patients did not recover 
from deteriorated liver function caused by RILD. There 
have been reports that patients with poor liver function 
could affect survival. Cardenes et al. [16] have reported 
that patients with CP-B with scores of 8 or greater are 
at high risk of severe toxicity and even death. In other 
study, patients with CP-B7 had improved survival and 
less toxicity than CP ≥ B8 patients [29]. According to 
these results, RILD in CP ≥ B8 patients could lead to 
irreversible deterioration of liver function, thereby af￾fecting survival.
Our study has some limitations. First, it was a retro￾spective study. Second, the study population was rela￾tively small. However, we included only HCC patients 
treated by SBRT. Third, we included a small number of 
patients with CP class B. Further investigation is needed 
to clarify the relationship between RILD and survival. 
In conclusion, CP score is closely associated with de￾velopment of RILD in patients with chronic liver dis￾ease. SBRT is a tolerable treatment for patients with 
CP ≤ B7, but not in those with CP ≥ B8. Caution should 
be used when SBRT is performed for patients with ad￾vanced liver cirrhosis.
KEY MESSAGE 
1. Pretreatment Child-Pugh (CP) score was im￾portant factor to predict radiation-induced liver 
disease (RILD) after stereotactic body radiother￾apy (SBRT). The increased risk of RILD associ￾ated with increased CP score.
2. In patients with CP score ≥ 8, RILD could lead 
to significant deterioration of liver function.
3. RILD after SBRT can be tolerable in patients 
with CP score ≤ 7.
