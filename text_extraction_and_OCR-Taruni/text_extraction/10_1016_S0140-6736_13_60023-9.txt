Summary
Background—Innate immunity contributes to the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, such as
type 1 diabetes, but until now no randomised, controlled trials of blockade of the key innate
immune mediator interleukin-1 have been done. We aimed to assess whether canakinumab, a
human monoclonal anti-interleukin-1 antibody, or anakinra, a human interleukin-1 receptor
antagonist, improved -cell function in recent-onset type 1 diabetes.
Methods—We did two randomised, placebo-controlled trials in two groups of patients with
recent-onset type 1 diabetes and mixed-meal-tolerance-test-stimulated C peptide of at least 0·2
nM. Patients in the canakinumab trial were aged 6–45 years and those in the anakinra trial were
aged 18–35 years. Patients in the canakinumab trial were enrolled at 12 sites in the USA and
Canada and those in the anakinra trial were enrolled at 14 sites across Europe. Participants were
randomly assigned by computer-generated blocked randomisation to subcutaneous injection of
either 2 mg/kg (maximum 300 mg) canakinumab or placebo monthly for 12 months or 100 mg
anakinra or placebo daily for 9 months. Participants and carers were masked to treatment
assignment. The primary endpoint was baseline-adjusted 2-h area under curve C-peptide response
to the mixed meal tolerance test at 12 months (canakinumab trial) and 9 months (anakinra trial).
Analyses were by intention to treat. These studies are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers
NCT00947427 and NCT00711503, and EudraCT number 2007-007146-34.
Findings—Patients were enrolled in the canakinumab trial between Nov 12, 2010, and April 11,
2011, and in the anakinra trial between Jan 26, 2009, and May 25, 2011. 69 patients were
randomly assigned to canakinumab (n=47) or placebo (n=22) monthly for 12 months and 69 were
randomly assigned to anakinra (n=35) or placebo (n=34) daily for 9 months. No interim analyses
were done. 45 canakinumab-treated and 21 placebo-treated patients in the canakinumab trial and
25 anakinra-treated and 26 placebo-treated patients in the anakinra trial were included in the
primary analyses. The difference in C peptide area under curve between the canakinumab and
placebo groups at 12 months was 0·01 nmol/L (95% CI −0·11 to 0·14; p=0·86), and between the
anakinra and the placebo groups at 9 months was 0·02 nmol/L (−0·09 to 0·15; p=0·71). The
number and severity of adverse events did not differ between groups in the canakinumab trial. In
the anakinra trial, patients in the anakinra group had significantly higher grades of adverse events
than the placebo group (p=0·018), which was mainly because of a higher number of injection site
reactions in the anakinra group.
Interpretation—Canakinumab and anakinra were safe but were not effective as single
immunomodulatory drugs in recent-onset type 1 diabetes. Interleukin-1 blockade might be more
effective in combination with treatments that target adaptive immunity in organ-specific
autoimmune disorders.
Funding—National Institutes of Health and Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation.
Introduction
Type 1 diabetes mellitus is characterised by progressive autoimmune destruction of
pancreatic cells, resulting in lifelong dependence on exogenous insulin administration and
risk of acute and late complications. At initial diagnosis, substantial -cell function
remains.1
 Persistent endogenous insulin secretion, defined as stimulated C-peptide

concentration greater than 0·2 nmol/L during a mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT), is
associated with reduced occurrence of severe hypoglycaemia and microvascular
complications.2,3 Thus, interventions that stop or delay decline of -cell function are
desirable.
Clinical trials to preserve -cell function in new-onset type 1 diabetes have focused on the
adaptive immune system. Treatment with anti-CD34–7 or abatacept,8
 which target T
lymphocytes, or anti-CD20,9
 which targets B lymphocytes, temporarily arrested the auto￾immune process, stabilising -cell function for about 6–12 months. However, the disease
recurred in all of these cases, consistent with transient suppression of the adaptive immune
system rather than durable immuno modulation.
Recent research has focused on the role of the innate immune system in type 1 diabetes.
Findings from a pilot clinical trial suggested that inhibition of tumour necrosis factor￾might have a beneficial effect in type 1 diabetes.10 However, particular attention has focused
on the role of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 , which is secreted by several cell
types in response to tissue insult. By binding to pancreatic -cell interleukin-1 type 1
receptors, interleukin-1 signals -cell secretory dys function and apoptosis via the nuclear
factor B and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, leading to endoplasmic reticulum
and mitochondrial stress.11 Hyperglycaemia also induces production and release of
interleukin-1 by pancreatic cells;12 interleukin-1 seems to act locally to inhibit insulin
biosynthesis and release13,14 and induce -cell apoptosis via activation of the death receptor
Fas.12,15 Because of its direct -cell proapoptotic action and mediatory effects on pancreatic
-cell glucotoxicity, interleukin-1 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of both type 1
and type 2 diabetes.
In addition to its effects in the innate immune system, interleukin-1 might be important in
the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes via its role as a potent amplifier of the adaptive immune
response. Interleukin-1 enhances expansion and survival of naive and memory T
lymphocytes, promotes differentiation of T lymphocytes towards pathological phenotypes
including T-helper-1 (Th1) and Th17, and enables effector T lymphocytes to proliferate
despite the modulating presence of regulatory T lymphocytes.16 Interleukin-1 might also
have an important role in monocyte trafficking.17
Thus, there is a strong preclinical rationale to implicate interleukin-1 as an immune mediator
of pancreatic -cell destruction leading to type 1 diabetes.11 Furthermore, in an open-label
pilot trial, interleukin-1 receptor blockade for 28 days in 15 children with new-onset
diabetes was well tolerated and lowered insulin needs and insulin-dose-adjusted glycated
haemoglobin concentrations compared with historical controls.18 So far, there have been no
randomised, placebo-controlled trials of interleukin-1 antagonism in patients with recent￾onset type 1 diabetes. Therefore, we hypothesised that inter leukin-1 inhibition in new￾onset type 1 diabetes would preserve -cell function by blocking direct and hyper
glycaemia-mediated -cell toxicity, reducing overall inflammation and favouring regulatory
T lymphocyte development and function. To assess this theory, in two trials we tested
whether canakinumab, a human mono clonal anti-interleukin-1 antibody, or anakinra, a
human interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, maintained or enhanced -cell function in recent￾onset type 1 diabetes. These studies also assessed the feasibility and safety and tolerability
of anti-interleukin-1 treatment.

Methods
Participants
Both studies were investigator-initiated, parallel-group, randomised, placebo-controlled
phase 2a clinical trials and conformed to all applicable regulatory requirements. Full details
of the TrialNet canakinumab study protocol are available on the Type 1 Diabetes TrialNet
website and details of the Anti-Interleukin-1 in Diabetes Action (AIDA) trial are on the
AIDA website. Eligible participants for the canakinumab trial were patients aged 6–45 years
at onset of diabetes diagnosed within the past 100 days before enrolment, who were positive
for at least one diabetes-associated autoantibody (microassayed insulin if duration of insulin
therapy was <7 days; glutamic acid decarboxylase-65 [GAD-65]; islet-cell antigen-512
[ICA-512]; or islet-cell autoantibodies), and who had a peak C-peptide concentration of at
least 0·2 nmol/L after a standardised MMTT undertaken at least 21 days after diagnosis of
diabetes and within 37 days of randomisation. Exclusion criteria were serological or clinical
evidence of present infection; past infection with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or HIV; a positive
PPD test; a history of malignancies or complicated medical issues; immunodeficiency; or
clinically significant blood count abnormalities.
Eligible participants for the anakinra (AIDA) trial were patients aged 18–35 years at onset of
diabetes with first symptoms of diabetes reported within the past 12 weeks before
enrolment, who were positive for GAD-65 auto-antibodies and had a peak C peptide of at
least 0·2 nM after a standardised MMTT undertaken after resolution of any polyuria,
polydipsia, or keto acidosis. Exclusion criteria were severe renal disease (creatinine
concentration >100 μmol/L) or liver disease (aspartate aminotransferase, alanine
aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase over twice the local laboratory upper reference
limit); history of heart disease, signs of cardiac failure, or abnormal electrocardiograph;
present or previous malignancy; pregnancy or breastfeeding; failure of fertile women to
comply with contraception planning (birth control pills, intrauterine device, or gestagen
implants); participation in other clinical intervention studies; anti-inflammatory treatment
(except aspirin ≤100 mg/day); active infections, history of recurrent infection, or
predisposition to infections; neutropenia (neutrophil count <1·5 × 109
 cells/L) or anaemia
(haemoglobin <80 g/L); immune-suppressive treatment or immune deficiency; presence at
diagnosis of late diabetic complications; concurrent vaccination with live vaccine; use of
etanercept within 4 weeks before screening or during the study period; and hypersensitivity
to Escherichia coli-derived proteins, anakinra, or any components of the product.
The protocols and consent documents were approved by independent ethics committees or
institutional review boards. All participants or parents provided written informed consent
before enrolment, and participants younger than 18 years provided assent. Independent data
and safety reviews were undertaken regularly.
Randomisation and masking
Patients were individually randomised by the data monitoring unit common for both trials by
a centralised computer-generated random allocation sequence with locked computer file
concealment. The TrialNet canakinumab study used 2:1 randomisation in permuted blocks
of six, and the AIDA trial used 1:1 randomisation in blocks of four within recruiting centres.
All participants and investigators were masked to treatment assignment.
Procedures
Screening, enrolment, and study visits took place at 12 TrialNet sites in the USA and
Canada and at 14 AIDA sites across Europe. All patients received intensive diabetes
management with a goal of maintaining American Diabetes Association glycated
Moran et al. Page 4

NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript

haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) targets for their age. In the TrialNet canakinumab study, the
participants’ primary physicians were responsible for their diabetes manage ment, with
support from the site research team. In the AIDA study, diabetes was managed by the site
research teams. Patients were treated with several daily insulin injections or by insulin
pump, with frequent daily self-monitoring of blood glucose concentrations. Non-insulin
drugs that affect glycaemic control were not allowed.
Participants in the canakinumab trial received monthly subcutaneous injections of 2 mg/kg
(maximum 300 mg) canakinumab (Novartis, Basel, Switzerland) or an identically appearing
placebo for 12 doses. The next dose was rescheduled in participants with signs of active
infection within the previous 48 h. If the patient remained ill during the study window, that
dose was skipped and not made up. Participants who were seronegative for Epstein-Barr
virus at baseline underwent assessment of Epstein-Barr viral load at each visit; if laboratory
evidence of active Epstein-Barr virus infection developed, treatment with the study drug was
stopped until resolution. All participants were followed up for at least 12 months.
On Aug 17, 2011, Novartis reported neutropenia as a potential risk of canakinumab
treatment. As a result, monthly pre-injection white blood cell counts were added to the
protocol. Before that, white blood cell counts were only obtained at 0, 6, and 12 months. The
dose was withheld if the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) was less than 1500 per mm3
. At
the time this amendment was introduced, no participant had completed the 12-month visit.
Participants in the AIDA trial received the recombinant human interleukin-1 receptor
antagonist anakinra at the US Food and Drug Administration approved daily dose of 100 mg
or placebo as a single, self-administered, subcutaneous injection every morning for 9
months. Anakinra and placebo were provided and distributed by Amgen (Thousand Oaks,
CA, USA). Compliance was assessed by counting returned empty vials and by measuring
plasma interleukin-1 receptor antagonist concentration at follow-up visits. Suspension of
treat ment for up to 2 weeks was allowed to resolve intercurrent disease or adverse events.
For both studies, -cell function was assessed by standard mixed-meal stimulated C-peptide
secretion,19 a validated surrogate marker for subsequent hard clinical outcomes in patients
with type 1 diabetes.2,3 Participants were given 6 mL/kg of Boost High Protein (Nestlé
Nutrition, Vervey, Switzerland) to a maximum of 360 mL ingested within 5 min, and blood
samples were taken at −10, 0, 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after start of ingestion for analysis
of C peptide and glucose.
Routine clinical laboratory tests were done locally at participating centres for both trials.
Outcome variables were analysed centrally by core laboratories. C peptide was measured
with a two-site immunoenzymometric assay (Tosoh Bioscience, South San Francisco, CA,
USA; TrialNet canakinumab trial) or a time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay (AutoDELFIA C￾peptide kit, Perkin Elmer–Wallac, Waltham, MA, USA; AIDA trial). HbA1c was measured
with ion-exchange high-performance liquid chromatography (Variant II, Bio-Rad
Diagnostics, Hercules, CA, USA; TrialNet canakinumab trial) or with a high-performance
liquid chromatography assay (Tosoh G7, Tosoh Bioscience, Tokyo, Japan; AIDA trial).
Auto antibodies (microassayed insulin, GAD-65, and ICA-512) were measured with
radioimmunobinding assays and islet-cell autoantibodies with indirect immunofluorescence.
In the TrialNet canakinumab trial, HLA class 2 alleles were measured with PCR
amplification and sequence-specific hybridisation. In the AIDA trial, high-sensitivity C￾reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 concentrations were measured by
chemiluminescence enzyme immunometric assays on the Immulite auto-analyser (Siemens
Healthcare Diagnostics, Erlangen, Germany), and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist
concentrations were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (human

NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript

interleukin-1 receptor antagonist/interleukin-1F3 immuno assay SRA00B, R&D Systems,
Abingdon, UK). Overall specimen completeness was over 95%.
The prespecified primary outcome in both trials was comparison of the area under the curve
(AUC) of stimulated C-peptide response over a 2-h MMTT at the 12 month (TrialNet
canakinumab) or 9 month (AIDA) visit. MMTTs were done at baseline and 1, 3, 6, and 9
months (participants in the TrialNet canakinumab trial had additionally the 12-month visit
and 18-month and 24-month off-treatment follow-up visits). Prespecified secondary
outcomes consisted of C-peptide slope over time (TrialNet canakinumab); peak and time to
peak of MMTT stimulated C peptide (AIDA); the time in trial until peak C peptide is less
than 0·2 nmol/L (TrialNet canakinumab); fasting glucose concentration (AIDA); HbA1c and
insulin dose over time (both trials); and change in circulating interleukin-6 and CRP
concentrations (AIDA). Pre specified subgroup analyses were by age, sex, ethnic origin,
body-mass index (AIDA only), baseline C peptide, baseline insulin use, baseline HbA1c and
HLA type, and duration of symptoms (AIDA only).
Adverse events were coded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
(CTCAE), version 3.0, with relation to study drug assessed by the investigators.
Statistical analysis
For the canakinumab trial, a sample size of 66 patients was needed to provide 85% power to
detect a 54% increase in the transformed mean of C peptide in the canakinumab treatment
group relative to the placebo group, with a one-sided test at =0·05 and 10% missing values.
Screening of new patients was closed before this target sample size was reached but patients
who had already begun screening were allowed to proceed. For the anakinra trial, a sample
size of 80 patients in each group (160 patients in total) was needed to provide 80% power to
detect a 30% difference in the C-peptide AUC between treatment groups, with a two-sided
test at =0·05 and 10% missing values.
All analyses were based on the prespecified intention-to-treat cohorts with known
measurements (complete case analysis); missing values were assumed to be missing at
random. The p values are two-sided unless otherwise specified. The significance levels
associated with the treatment effect were from the Wald test (from the fitted model).
Treatment comparisons of adverse event grades were analysed with the Wilcoxon rank sum
test and the occurrence of each adverse effect type was analysed with the Fisher’s exact test
(one-sided tests). Spotfire S+ (version 8.1) was used for all analyses.
We used an ANCOVA model adjusted for age, sex, baseline value of the dependent
variable, and treatment assignment to analyse the mean AUC of C peptide, percentage of
HbA1c, and total daily insulin dose. The predicted means and associated 95% CIs for each
treatment group were calculated at the means of the other covariates.
A normalising transformation of log (Xc peptide + 1) was prespecified for the mean AUC of
C peptide, and normal plots of the residuals suggested that this was adequate (data not
shown). The unadjusted geometric-like mean was calculated using the same transformation
and was then averaged and the inverse transformation was applied. The mean AUC of C
peptide is equal to the AUC divided by the 2-h interval. The AUC was computed by the
trapezoidal rule from the first 2 h of the timed measurement of C peptide during the MMTT.
The time to first stimulated peak C peptide of less than 0·2 nmol/L was analysed with the
Cox model with covariates for testing and the Kaplan-Meier method for plotting the results.
The rate of change of the mean AUC of C peptide was estimated by use of a mixed effects
model, with random intercept and slope adjusted for age, sex, mean AUC of C peptide at
baseline, and treatment assignment. The initial fit included a fixed interaction effect of

treatment and time but was removed because there was no statistical evidence to suggest that
value was anything other than zero. The 95% CIs for the difference in the population means
of C peptide and the percent decrease of C peptide from baseline were determined using a
bootstrap technique.
The TrialNet canakinumab and AIDA trials are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers
NCT00947427 and 00711503, respectively, and the AIDA trial is also registered as
EudraCT number 2007-007146-34.
Role of the funding source
The TrialNet canakinumab trial was designed by the Type 1 Diabetes TrialNet Study Group.
Novartis provided unpublished clinical data from other canakinumab trials, provided input
regarding the drug dose, and supplied canakinumab and placebo. Novartis had no other
involvement in study design, undertaking, or manage ment; data collection, analysis, or
interpretation; or writing of the report. A Cooperative Research and Development
Agreement between Novartis and the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and
Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) at the National Institutes of Health (sponsor of the Type 1
Diabetes TrialNet canakinumab study), specified that both the NIDDK and Novartis would
keep study data confidential until published. The authors provided Novartis with a copy of
the original report before sub mission; Novartis made no amendments but did make
suggestions in terms of readability of language. The TrialNet canakinumab writing
committee had full access to all the data in the canakinumab study and had the final
responsibility for the decision to submit for publication. JSS assumes responsibility for the
overall content and integrity of the canakinumab portion of the manuscript.
The Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF) approved the AIDA study design and
protocol and decided to prematurely stop enrolment, but was not involved in data collection,
data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. Amgen supplied anakinra and
placebo, prepared drug labelling, and distributed the drug according to good laboratory
practice principles, including temperature monitoring until delivery to centres. Amgen had
no other involvement in study design, undertaking, or management; data collection, analysis,
or interpretation; or writing of the report. TMP had full access to all the data in the AIDA
study and had the final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.
Results
Canakinumab trial
Between Nov 12, 2010, and April 11, 2011, 105 participants were assessed for eligibility
and 69 were randomly assigned; 47 to canakinumab and 22 to placebo (figure 1; appendix).
The last patient completed the 12-month follow-up on April 27, 2012.
756 (91%) of 828 potential injections were given. Of the 72 missed injections (39 in the
canakinumab group and 33 in the placebo group), 48 (67%) were held (ie, skipped) by the
investigators as per the study protocol (eg, because of active infection or low ANC at time of
injection). Of the 69 participants, one (in the canakinumab group) did not have the 6-month
MMTT and three (two in the canakinumab group and one in the placebo group) did not have
the 1-year MMTT. Clinical and demographic characteristics were well balanced between
treatment groups (table 1).
Population means for the 2 h AUC of stimulated C peptide adjusted for age, sex, and
baseline C-peptide value were similar between the groups at 1 year (canakinumab 0·41
nmol/L, 95% CI 0·34–0·47; and placebo 0·40 nmol/L, 0·30–0·49; figure 2). The difference
between groups was not significant (0·01 nmol/L, 95% CI −0·11 to 0·14; p=0·86). Between

baseline and 1 year, there was a 35% (95% CI 21·8–45·6) and 33% (3·1–51·6) reduction in
the population means of C peptide in the canakinumab and placebo groups, respectively.
When the population means were assumed to be linear over time in a mixed model, the
decay rates (ie, slopes) were not different between the groups (appendix). Time to stimulated
peak C peptide less than 0·2 nmol/L also did not differ between the two groups (appendix).
Percentages of HbA1c increased gradually over time and were similar between
canakinumab-treated and placebo-treated participants at 1 year (p=0·76; appendix).
Similarly, there was no difference in insulin dose at 1 year between groups (p=0·53;
appendix).
In a predefined subgroup analysis, a homogeneity test of treatment effect on age, sex, ethnic
origin, baseline C peptide, insulin use, percentage of HbA1c, and HLA type was done
(appendix). The canakinumab-treated group had significantly (homogeneity test) lower C￾peptide concentrations at 1 year in participants with C peptide in the lower tertile at baseline
(p=0·036).
There were two serious adverse events during the canakinumab trial: a case of appendicitis
in a participant in the placebo group and suicidal ideation in a participant in the
canakinumab group (table 2). Both were deemed unrelated to study drugs. The number and
severity of adverse events did not differ between groups (table 3). Despite its potential anti￾inflammatory effects, canakinumab did not result in more frequent or more severe
infections.
Neutropenia was common in both groups and did not differ significantly by treatment arm
(p=0·11, one-sided). Eight (17%) canakinumab-treated patients had 12 episodes of
neutropenia compared with three (14%) placebo-treated patients who had six episodes of
neutropenia. Neutropenia was grade 2 (ANC 1000–1499 per mm3
) in most cases, but there
were four instances of grade 3 neutropenia (ANC 500–999 per mm3
): one instance each in
two canakinumab-treated patients and two instances in a patient on placebo. In all but one of
these cases (the placebo-treated patient), several doses of study drug were not associated
with subsequent neutropenia.
Anakinra trial
Between Jan 26, 2009, and May 25, 2011, 90 participants were assessed for eligibility and
72 were eligible, 69 of whom were randomly assigned to anakinra (n=35) or placebo (n=34;
figure 3; appendix). The study was stopped on July 31, 2011 owing to slow recruitment. A
similar number of participants withdrew in the two groups, all within 4 months of the start of
treatment. 25 participants assigned to anakinra and 26 assigned to placebo completed the 9-
month follow-up visit. The last patient completed follow-up on Jan 17, 2012.
The mean ratio of used vials to elapsed days was lower in the anakinra group than in the
placebo group (61·8% vs 67·9%, respectively, Wilcoxon test p<0·0001) Nevertheless, the
mean plasma interleukin-1 receptor antagonist concentrations in the anakinra group at
follow-up visits were increased 226–815 times over the corresponding means in the placebo
group throughout the study (all p<0·001; appendix).
The groups were well balanced for clinical and demographic characteristics with the
exception of inter-leukin-6 and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist concentrations (table 4).
For interleukin-6 concentration, the reported difference was attributable to one extreme
value that distorted the mean and standard deviation for the placebo group. For interleukin-1
receptor antagonist concentration, there were two extreme values that distorted the mean and
standard deviation for the anakinra group.

Population means for the 2 h AUC of stimulated C peptide adjusted for age, sex, and
baseline C-peptide value were similar between the groups at 9 months (anakinra 0·53 nmol/
L, 95% CI 0·44–0·62; and placebo 0·51 nmol/L, 0·42–0·60, figure 4). The difference was not
significant (0·02 nmol/L, 95% CI −0·09 to 0·15; p=0·71).
Anakinra did not affect incremental or peak C-peptide response to a MMTT, percentage of
HbA1c or fasting and AUC glucose concentration during an MMTT, plasma interleukin-6 or
overall CRP concentrations (appendix), or time to peak C-peptide response to an MMTT
(data not shown). No participant achieved an insulin-free state with maintenance of a HbA1c
percentage less than 7·5%.
A predefined subgroup analysis of treatment effect was done within the following variables:
age, sex, ethnic origin, baseline C peptide, baseline body-mass index, insulin use, HbA1c,
HLA type, and symptom duration. Only the interaction between treatment and the three
categorised levels of C peptide was statistically significant (p=0·006; appendix).
The anakinra group reported significantly higher grades of adverse events than the placebo
group (p=0·018, one-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test), primarily as a result of the higher
frequency of grade 2 events in the anakinra group (table 5). Analysis of adverse events by
category revealed that dermatological and skin events was the only category that was
significantly different between treatment groups (p=0·017, one-sided Fisher’s exact test;
table 6). This difference was attributable to 17 and four participants with injection site
reactions from the anakinra and placebo groups, respectively (p=0·0009).
Discussion
Our results show that inhibition of interleukin-1 with canakinumab or anakinra did not
slow -cell decline in recent-onset type 1 diabetes. At the end of the two trials, stimulated C￾peptide concentrations and percentages of HbA1c did not differ between intervention-treated
and placebo-treated patients. Although both trials studied individuals with recent-onset type
1 diabetes, their entry criteria—particularly regarding age—and their trial design were
different. Enrolment proceeded rapidly in the canakinumab study, probably because of the
enthusiasm of younger patients and their parents for participation in clinical trials. The
anakinra study had slow enrolment and was stopped owing to slow recruitment. The
protocol was more demanding for patients in the anakinra study because daily injections
were needed by the participants, whereas in the canakinumab trial there were monthly
injections of drug at the clinical sites.
Several approaches to preserve -cell function in new-onset type 1 diabetes have targeted
different aspects of the autoimmune process with partial success (panel). Anti-CD3
monoclonal antibody4–7 and abatacept,8
 both of which affect T lymphocytes, prevented -
cell decline for 6–12 months. Anti-CD20, which is directed against B lymphocytes, had a
comparable effect.9
 These attempts to alter the immune course of type 1 diabetes relied on
single-drug therapy. In the cancer specialty, the advent of protocols employing combination
therapy has been associated with dramatically improved outcomes. Similarly, to halt -cell
destruction and prevent type 1 diabetes, a rational combination of synergistic drugs directed
against different aspects of the autoimmune process might be needed.
Although anti-interleukin-1 single-drug therapy did not prevent decline of -cell function in
these two trials, this approach might still be attractive as a component of combination
therapy, both because of the part inter-leukin-1 plays in local -cell inflammation and
apoptosis11–15 and because interleukin-1 inhibition might help promote regulatory T￾lymphocyte responses.16 In preclinical studies, although interleukin-1 inhibition alone did
not affect C-peptide secretion in NOD mice, the combination of interleukin-1 blockade and

anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody resulted in significantly greater clinical remission of diabetes
than anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody alone.23
Future plans to use interleukin-1 blockade in combination therapy must take into
consideration the timing of drug initiation. Once clinical type 1 diabetes is apparent, it might
be too late for interleukin-1 blockade to significantly affect the disease course.
Interleukin-1 gene expression in peripheral blood monocytes is high at initial diabetes
diagnosis but normalises within 1 month.24 Furthermore, diabetes autoantibody-positive
first-degree relatives of individuals with type 1 diabetes, known to be at high risk for future
development of diabetes, have increased monocyte and dendritic cell expression of
interleukin-1 .
25 Thus, interleukin-1 inhibition might be more effective earlier, during the
prediabetes period. If a combination therapy approach is used, careful attention will need to
be paid to the potential side-effects of any drugs used, both individually and in combination.
In summary, as a single-drug therapy for new-onset type 1 diabetes, neither canakinumab
nor anakinra slowed the decline in -cell function in the two clinical trials. The drugs were
generally well tolerated with no major safety issues emerging. These data, combined with
NOD mouse-model evidence of synergy with other immunomodulatory drugs,23 suggest
that interleukin-1 blockade might be more suitable for combination therapy protocols in
new-onset type 1 diabetes or in prevention trials in individuals with pre-type 1 diabetes.

Panel: Research in context
Systematic review
We searched PubMed for articles published up to Sept 1, 2012, with the search terms
“immune intervention” and “type 1 diabetes”, “canakinumab”, and “anakinra”. Four
randomised trials with adequate sample size showed some preservation of -cell function
in type 1 diabetes mellitus as evidenced by stimulated C-peptide secretion. These trials
used anti-CD3,4–7 anti-CD20,9
 and abatacept.8
 An additional study suggested some
efficacy with early treatment using GAD-65 antigen,20 but this was not supported by two
subsequent trials.21,22 So far, there have been no randomised, placebo-controlled trials of
interleukin-1 antagonism in patients with recent-onset type 1 diabetes.
Interpretation
Our results showed that inhibition of interleukin-1 with either canakinumab or anakinra
did not slow the reduction in -cell function in new-onset type 1 diabetes. Further study
is needed to establish whether such treatment might be more effective in combination
with other drugs or earlier in the course of type 1 diabetes (ie, in the prediabetes period).

Each adverse event category by treatment group was tested using a one-sided Fisher’s exact test. Only the difference between groups in the adverse
event category dermatological or skin reached statistical significance (p=0·017). Of the 28 participants who had dermatological or skin reactions,
21 had injection-site reactions, 17 of whom were from the anakinra group (p=0·0009).
