Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly affected mortality worldwide1
. There 
is unprecedented urgency to understand who is most at risk of severe outcomes, and 
this requires new approaches for the timely analysis of large datasets. Working on 
behalf of NHS England, we created OpenSAFELY—a secure health analytics platform 
that covers 40% of all patients in England and holds patient data within the existing 
data centre of a major vendor of primary care electronic health records. Here we used 
OpenSAFELY to examine factors associated with COVID-19-related death. Primary 
care records of 17,278,392 adults were pseudonymously linked to 10,926 COVID￾19-related deaths. COVID-19-related death was associated with: being male (hazard 
ratio (HR) 1.59 (95% confidence interval 1.53–1.65)); greater age and deprivation 
(both with a strong gradient); diabetes; severe asthma; and various other medical 
conditions. Compared with people of white ethnicity, Black and South Asian people 
were at higher risk, even after adjustment for other factors (HR 1.48 (1.29–1.69) and 
1.45 (1.32–1.58), respectively). We have quantified a range of clinical factors associated 
with COVID-19-related death in one of the largest cohort studies on this topic so far. 
More patient records are rapidly being added to OpenSAFELY, we will update and 
extend our results regularly.
On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) character￾ized COVID-19—which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)—as a pandemic, after 118,000 cases and 
4,291 deaths were reported in 114 countries2
. As of 6 May 2020 (the 
date of latest data availability for this study), cases had reached over 
3.5 million globally, with more than 240,000 deaths attributed to the 
virus1
. On the same day in the UK, there had been 206,715 confirmed 
cases of COVID-19, and 30,615 COVID-19-related deaths3
.
Age and gender are well-established risk factors for severe COVID￾19 outcomes: over 90% of the COVID-19-related deaths in the UK have 
been in people over 60, and 60% in men4
. Various pre-existing condi￾tions have also been associated with increased risk. For example, the 
Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported in a study 
of 44,672 individuals (1,023 deaths) that cardiovascular disease, hyper￾tension, diabetes, respiratory disease and cancers were associated with 
an increased risk of death5
; however, correction for relationships with 
age was not possible. A UK cross-sectional survey of 16,749 patients 
who were hospitalized with COVID-19 showed that the risk of death 
was higher for patients with cardiac, pulmonary and kidney disease, as 
well as cancer, dementia and obesity (HRs of 1.19–1.39 after correction 
for age and sex)6
. Obesity was associated with treatment escalation 
in a French intensive care cohort7
 (n = 124) and a New York hospital 
presentation cohort8
 (n = 3,615). The risks associated with smoking 
are unclear9–11. People from Black and minority ethnic groups are at 
increased risk of poor outcomes from COVID-19, for reasons that are 
unclear12,13.
Patient care is typically managed through electronic health records, 
which are commonly used in research. However traditional approaches 
to the analysis of electronic health records rely on intermittent extracts 
of small samples of historic data. Evaluating a rapidly arising novel 
cause of death requires a new approach. We therefore set out to deliver 
a secure analytics platform inside the data centre of major electronic 
health records vendors, running across the full, linked and pseu￾donymized electronic health records of a very large population of NHS 
patients, to determine factors that are associated with COVID-19-related 
death in England.
Associations with COVID-19-related death
In total, 17,278,392 adults were included (Fig. 1; cohort description 
in Table 1). Eleven per cent of individuals (1,851,868) had ethnicity 
recorded as mixed, South Asian, Black or other (hereafter referred to

as Black and minority ethnic, BAME). There were missing data for body 
mass index (3,751,769; 22%), smoking status (720,923; 4%), ethnicity 
(4,560,113; 26%) and blood pressure (1,715,095; 10%). COVID-19-related 
death was recorded in linked death registration data for 10,926 of the 
study population.
The overall cumulative incidence of COVID-19-related death 90 days 
after the start of the study was less than 0.01% in those aged 18–39 
years, rising to 0.67% and 0.44% in men and women, respectively, aged 
80 years or over (Fig. 2).
Associations between patient-level factors and risk of 
COVID-19-related death are shown in Table 2 and Fig. 3. Increasing 
age was strongly associated with risk, with people aged 80 or over hav￾ing a more than 20-fold-increased risk compared to 50–59-year-olds 
(fully adjusted HR 20.60; 95% confidence interval (CI) 18.70–22.68). 
With age fitted as a flexible spline, an approximately log-linear relation￾ship was observed (Extended Data Fig. 1). Men had a higher risk than 
women (fully adjusted HR 1.59 (1.53–1.65)). These findings are consist￾ent with patterns observed in smaller studies worldwide and in the UK14.
People from all BAME groups were at higher risk than those of white 
ethnicity. When adjusted only for age and sex, hazard ratios ranged from 
1.62–1.88 for Black and South Asian individuals and people of mixed 
ethnicities, compared to white people, decreasing to 1.43–1.48 after 
adjustment for all included factors (results for more detailed categories 
are shown in Extended Data Table 1). BAME ethnicity has previously 
been found to be associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 infection 
and poor outcomes12,13,15. Our findings show that only a small part of 
the excess risk is explained by a higher prevalence of medical problems 
such as cardiovascular disease or diabetes among BAME people, or by 
higher levels of deprivation.
We found a consistent pattern of increasing risk with greater depriva￾tion, with the most deprived quintile having a hazard ratio of 1.79 com￾pared to the least deprived, consistent with recent national statistics16. 
Again, very little of this increased risk was explained by pre-existing 
disease or clinical factors, suggesting that other social factors have 
an important role.
Increasing risks were seen with increasing obesity (fully adjusted HR 
1.92 (1.72–2.13) for a body mass index (BMI; kg m−2) of over 40), and most 
comorbidities were associated with a higher risk of COVID-19-related 
death, including diabetes (greater hazard ratio for those with a 
recently measured glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) level of at least 
58 mmol mol−1), severe asthma (defined as asthma with recent use of 
an oral corticosteroid), respiratory disease, chronic heart disease, 
liver disease, stroke, dementia, other neurological diseases, reduced 
kidney function (greater hazard ratio associated with a lower estimated 
glomerular filtration rate; eGFR), autoimmune diseases (rheumatoid 
arthritis, lupus or psoriasis) and other immunosuppressive conditions 
(Table 2). Those with a recent (that is, in the last five years) history of 
haematological malignancy had an at least 2.5-fold increased risk, which 
decreased slightly after five years. For other cancers, hazard ratios 
were smaller and increased risks were associated mainly with recent 
diagnoses. A history of dialysis or end-stage renal failure was associ￾ated with increased risk when added in a secondary analysis (HR 3.69 
(3.09–4.39)). These findings largely concur with other data, including 
the UK international severe acute respiratory and emerging infection 
consortium (ISARIC) study of hospitalized UK patients with COVID￾19—which indicated an increased risk of death with cardiac, pulmonary 
and kidney disease, malignancy, obesity and dementia6
—and a large 
Chinese study that, although lacking correction for age, suggested that 
cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, respiratory disease and 
cancers are associated with increased mortality5
. Our results showing 
that severe asthma is associated with a higher risk are notable, as early 
data suggested that asthma was under-represented in patients with 
COVID-19 who were hospitalized or had severe outcomes17,18.
Post hoc analyses of smoking and hypertension
Both current and former smoking were associated with a higher risk in 
models that were adjusted for age and sex only, but in the fully adjusted 
model current smoking was associated with a lower risk (fully adjusted 
HR 0.89 (0.82–0.97)), which concurs with the lower than expected 
prevalence of smoking that was observed in previous studies among 
patients with COVID-19 in China10, France11 and the United States19. 
We investigated this in more depth post hoc by adding covariates indi￾vidually to the age, sex and smoking model, and found that the change 
in hazard ratio was driven largely by adjustment for chronic respiratory 
disease (HR 0.98 (0.90–1.06) after adjustment). This and other comor￾bidities could be consequences of smoking, highlighting that the fully 
adjusted smoking hazard ratio cannot be interpreted causally owing to 
the inclusion of factors that are likely to mediate smoking effects. We 
therefore then fitted a model adjusted for demographic factors only 
(age, sex, deprivation and ethnicity), which showed a non-significant 
positive hazard ratio for current smoking (HR 1.07 (0.98–1.18)). 
This does not support any postulated protective effect of nicotine9,20, 
but suggests that any increased risk with current smoking is likely to 
be small and will need to be clarified as the epidemic progresses and 
more data accumulate.
We similarly investigated the change in the hypertension hazard ratio 
(from 1.09 (1.05–1.14) adjusted for age and sex, to 0.89 (0.85–0.93) with 
all covariates included), and found that diabetes and obesity were prin￾cipally responsible for this reduction (HR 0.97 (0.92–1.01) adjusted for 
age, sex, diabetes and obesity). Given the strong association between 
blood pressure and age we then examined the interaction between these 
variables; this revealed strong evidence of interaction (P < 0.001), with 
hypertension associated with a higher risk up to the age of 70 years 
and a lower risk above the age of 70 (adjusted HRs 3.10 (1.69–5.70), 
2.73 (1.96–3.81), 2.07 (1.73–2.47), 1.32 (1.17–1.50), 0.94 (0.86–1.02) 
and 0.73 (0.69–0.78) for ages 18–39, 40–49, 50–59, 60–69, 70–79 and 
80 or over, respectively). The reasons for the inverse association

between hypertension and mortality in older individuals are unclear 
and warrant further investigation, including detailed examination of 
frailty, comorbidity and drug exposures in this age group.
Model checking and sensitivity analyses
The average C-statistic—a measure of the model’s ability to distinguish 
between patients who experience COVID-19-related deaths and those 
who do not, ranging from 0 (no ability) to 1 (perfect ability)—was 0.93. 
Results were similar when missing data were handled using analysis 
of complete records only, or using multiple imputation (sensitivity 
analyses; Extended Data Table 2). Non-proportional hazards were 
detected in the primary model (P < 0.001). A sensitivity analysis with 
earlier administrative censoring at 6 April 2020—before which mor￾tality should not have been affected by the social distancing policies 
that were introduced in the UK in late March—showed no evidence of 
non-proportional hazards (P = 0.83). Hazard ratios were similar but 
somewhat larger in magnitude for some covariates, whereas the asso￾ciation with increasing deprivation appeared to be smaller (Extended 
Data Table 2).
Discussion
This secure analytics platform operating across NHS patient records of 
over 17 million adults and 6 million children was used to identify, quan￾tify and analyse factors associated with COVID-19-related death in one 
of the largest cohort studies on this topic conducted by any country so 
far. Most comorbidities were associated with increased risk, including 
cardiovascular disease, diabetes, respiratory disease (including severe 
asthma), obesity, a history of haematological malignancy or recent 
other cancer, kidney, liver and neurological diseases, and autoimmune 
conditions. South Asian and Black people had a substantially higher 
risk of COVID-19-related death than white people, and this was only 
partly attributable to comorbidities, deprivation or other factors. A 
strong association between deprivation and risk was also only partly 
explained by comorbidities or other factors.
Our analyses provide a preliminary picture of how key demographic 
characteristics and a range of comorbidities—which were a priori 
selected as being of interest in COVID-19—are jointly associated with 
poor outcomes. These initial results may be used to inform the devel￾opment of prognostic models. We caution against interpreting our 
estimates as causal effects. For example, the fully adjusted smoking 
hazard ratio does not capture the causal effect of smoking, owing to 
the inclusion of comorbidities that are likely to mediate any effect of 
smoking on COVID-19-related death (for example, chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease). Our study has highlighted a need for carefully 
designed analyses that specifically focus on the causal effect of smoking 
on COVID-19-related death. Similarly, there is a need for analyses explor￾ing the causal relationships that underlie the associations observed 
between hypertension and COVID-19-related death.
Strengths and weaknesses
The greatest strengths of this study are its size and the speed at which 
it was conducted. By building a secure analytics platform across rou￾tinely collected live clinical data stored in situ, we have produced timely 
results from the current NHS records of approximately 40% of the 
English population. The large scale of the study allows more preci￾sion—on rarer exposures and on multiple factors—and rapid detection 
of important signals. Our platform will expand to provide updated 
analyses over time. Another strength is our use of open methods: we 
pre-specified our analysis plan and shared our full analytic code and 
codelists for review and reuse. We ascertained patient demographics, 
medications and comorbidities from full pseudonymized longitudinal 
primary care records, which provide substantially more detail than 
data that are recorded on admission to hospital, and which take into 
account the total population rather than the selected subset of individu￾als who present at hospitals. We censored deaths from other causes 
using data from the UK Office for National Statistics (ONS). Analyses 
were stratified by area to account for known geographical differences 
in the incidence of COVID-19.
The study also has some important limitations. In our outcome defi￾nition, we included clinically suspected (non-laboratory-confirmed) 
cases of COVID-19, because testing has not always been carried out, 
especially in older patients in care homes. However, this may have

resulted in some patients being incorrectly identified as having 
COVID-19. In addition, some COVID-19-related deaths may have been 
misclassified as non-COVID-19, particularly in the early stages of the 
pandemic; however, this inaccuracy is likely to have reduced quickly as 
the number of deaths increased, and a degree of outcome underascer￾tainment—providing it is unrelated to patient characteristics—should 
not have biased our hazard ratios. Owing to the rarity of the outcome, 
the associations observed will be driven primarily by the profile of 
patient characteristics in the included cases. Our findings reflect both 
an individual’s risk of infection and their risk of dying once infected. 
We will consider more detailed patient trajectories in future research 
within the OpenSAFELY platform.
Our large population may not be fully representative. We include 
only 17% of general practices in London—where many of the earlier 
cases of COVID-19 occurred—owing to the substantial geographical 
variation in the choice of electronic health record system. The user 
interface of electronic health records can affect prescribing of certain 
medicines21–23, so it is possible that coding varies between systems.
Primary care records are detailed and longitudinal, but can be 
incomplete for data on patient characteristics. Ethnicity was missing 
for approximately 26% of patients, but was broadly representative24; 
there were also missing data on obesity and smoking. Sensitivity analy￾ses found that our estimates were robust to our assumptions around 
missing data.
Non-proportional hazards could be due to very large numbers or 
unmeasured covariates. However, rapid changes in social behaviours 
(social distancing, shielding) and changes in the burden of infection 
may also have affected patient groups differentially. The larger hazard 
ratios seen for several covariates in a sensitivity analysis with earlier 
censoring (soon after social distancing and shielding policies were 
introduced) are consistent with patients who are more at risk being 
more compliant with these policies. By contrast, the risk associated 
with deprivation may have increased over time. Further analyses will 
explore the changes before and after the implementation of national 
initiatives around COVID-19.
Policy implications and interpretation
The UK has a policy of recommending shielding (staying at home at 
all times and avoiding any face-to-face contact) for groups who are 
identified as being extremely vulnerable to COVID-19 on the basis of 
pre-existing medical conditions25. We were able to evaluate the associa￾tion between most of these conditions and death from COVID-19, and 
we confirmed the increased mortality risks, supporting the targeted 
use of additional protection measures for people in these groups. We 
have demonstrated that only a small part of the substantially increased 
risks of COVID-19-related death among BAME groups and among peo￾ple living in more-deprived areas can be attributed to existing disease. 
Improved strategies to protect people in these groups are urgently 
needed26. These might include the specific consideration of BAME 
groups in shielding guidelines and workplace policies. Studies are 
needed to investigate the interplay of additional factors that we were 
unable to examine, including employment, access to personal pro￾tective equipment and the related risk of exposure to infection, and 
household density.
The UK has an unusually large volume of very detailed longitudi￾nal patient data, especially through primary care, and we believe the 
UK has a responsibility to the global community to make good use of 
this data. OpenSAFELY demonstrates—on a very large scale—that this 
can be done securely, transparently and rapidly. We will enhance the 
OpenSAFELY platform to further inform the global response to the 
COVID-19 emergency.
Future research
The underlying causes of the higher risk of COVID-19-related death 
among BAME individuals, and among people from deprived areas, 
require further investigation. We would suggest collecting data on 
occupational exposure and living conditions as first steps. The sta￾tistical power offered by our approach means that associations with 
less-common factors can be robustly assessed in more detail and at the 
earliest possible date as the pandemic progresses. We will therefore 
update our findings and address smaller risk groups as new cases arise 
over time. The open source reusable codebase on OpenSAFELY sup￾ports the rapid, secure and collaborative development of new analyses; 
we are currently conducting expedited studies on the effects of various 
medical treatments and population interventions on the risk of COVID￾19 infection, admission to intensive care units and death, alongside 
other observational analyses. OpenSAFELY is rapidly scalable for the 
incorporation of more NHS patient records, and new sources of data 
are progressing.
In conclusion, we have generated early insights into factors asso￾ciated with COVID-19-related death using the detailed primary care

Methods
Study design
We conducted a cohort study using national primary care electronic 
health record data linked to data on COVID-19-related deaths (see ‘Data 
source’). The cohort study began on 1 February 2020, which was cho￾sen as a date several weeks before the first reported COVID-19-related 
deaths and the day after the second laboratory-confirmed case27; and 
ended on 6 May 2020. The cohort study examines risk among the gen￾eral population rather than in a population infected with SARS-COV-2. 
Therefore, all patients were included irrespective of any SARS-COV-2 
test results. No randomization was undertaken. Outcome assessment 
was undertaken as part of routine health care, therefore no blinding of 
any sort was attempted. However, study investigators had no involve￾ment in outcome assessment.
Data source
We used patient data from general practice (GP) records managed by 
the GP software provider The Phoenix Partnership (TPP), linked to 
death data from the ONS. ONS data include information on all deaths, 
including COVID-19-related death (defined as a COVID-19 ICD-10 code 
mentioned anywhere on the death certificate) and non-COVID-19 death, 
which was used for censoring.
The data were accessed, linked and analysed using OpenSAFELY, 
a new data analytics platform that was created to address urgent 
questions relating to the epidemiology and treatment of COVID￾19 in England. OpenSAFELY provides a secure software interface 
that allows detailed pseudonymized primary care patient records 
to be analysed in near-real time where they already reside—hosted 
within the highly secure data centre of the electronic health records 
vendor—to minimize the reidentification risks when data are 
transported off-site; other smaller datasets are linked to these 
data within the same environment using a matching pseudonym 
derived from the NHS number. More information can be found at 
https://opensafely.org/.
The dataset that was analysed with OpenSAFELY is based on around 
24 million currently registered patients (approximately 40% of the Eng￾lish population) from GP surgeries using the TPP SystmOne electronic 
health record system. SystmOne is a secure centralized electronic health 
records system that has been used in English clinical practice since 1998; 
it records data entered (in real time) by GPs and practice staff during 
routine primary care. The system is accredited under the NHS-approved 
systems framework for general practice28,29. Data extracted from TPP 
SystmOne have previously been used in medical research, as part of 
the ResearchOne dataset30,31. From these electronic health records a 
pseudonymized dataset was created for OpenSAFELY that consisted of 
20 billion rows of structured data; including, for example, the diagno￾ses, medications, physiological parameters and prior investigations of 
pseudonymized patients (Extended Data Fig. 2, level 1). All OpenSAFELY 
data processing took place on TPP’s servers; external data providers 
securely transferred pseudoymized data (such as COVID-19-related 
death from ONS) for linkage to OpenSAFELY (Extended Data Fig. 2, 
level 2); and study definitions developed in Python on GitHub were 
pulled into the OpenSAFELY infrastructure and used to create a study 
dataset of one row per patient (Extended Data Fig. 2, level 3). Statistical 
code was developed using synthetic data and used to analyse the study 
dataset; this included code to check data ranges, to check consistency 
of data columns and to produce descriptive statistics for comparison 
with expected disease prevalences to ensure validity, as well as code 
to fit our analysis models. Only two authors (K.B. and A.J.W.) accessed 
OpenSAFELY to run code; no pseudonymized patient-level data were 
ever removed from TPP infrastructure; and only aggregated, anony￾mous, manually checked study results were released for publication 
(Extended Data Fig. 2, level 4), All code for data management and analy￾sis is archived online (see ‘Code availability’).
Study population and observation period
Our study population consisted of all adults (males and females 
18 years and above) currently registered as active patients in a TPP GP 
surgery in England on 1 February 2020. To be included in the study, 
participants were required to have at least one year of prior follow-up 
in the GP practice to ensure that baseline patient characteristics could 
be adequately captured, and to have recorded sex, age and depriva￾tion32 (see ‘Covariates’). Patients were observed from 1 February 2020 
and were followed until the first of either their death date (whether 
COVID-19-related or due to other causes) or the study end date, 6 May 
2020. For this analysis, ONS death data were available to 11 May 2020, 
but we used an earlier censor date to allow for delays in reporting of 
the last few days of available data.
Outcomes
The outcome was COVID-19-related death; this was ascertained from 
ONS death certificate data in which the COVID related ICD-10 codes 
U071 or U072 were present in the record.
Covariates
Characteristics included: health conditions listed in UK guidance on 
‘higher risk’ groups33; other common conditions that may cause immu￾nodeficiency inherently or through medication (cancer and common 
autoimmune conditions); and emerging risk factors for severe out￾comes among COVID-19 cases (such as raised blood pressure).
Age, sex, BMI (kg m−2) and smoking status were included. Where 
categorized, age groups were: 18–39, 40–49, 50–59, 60–69, 70–79 and 
80+ years. BMI was ascertained from weight measurements within the 
last 10 years, restricted to those taken when the patient was over 16 
years old. Obesity was grouped using categories derived from the WHO 
classification of BMI: no evidence of obesity, BMI < 30; obese class I, 
BMI 30–34.9; obese class II, BMI 35–39.9; and obese class III, BMI 40+. 
Smoking status was grouped into current-, former- and never-smokers.
The following comorbidities were also considered: asthma, other 
chronic respiratory disease, chronic heart disease, diabetes mellitus, 
chronic liver disease, chronic neurological diseases, common autoim￾mune diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus or 
psoriasis), solid organ transplant, asplenia, other immunosuppressive 
conditions, cancer, evidence of reduced kidney function, and raised 
blood pressure or a diagnosis of hypertension.
Disease groupings followed national guidance on risk of influenza 
infection34, therefore ‘chronic respiratory disease (other than asthma)’ 
included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, fibrosing lung dis￾ease, bronchiectasis or cystic fibrosis; and ‘chronic heart disease’ 
included chronic heart failure, ischaemic heart disease, and severe valve 
or congenital heart disease likely to require lifelong follow-up. Chronic 
neurological conditions were separated into diseases with a probable 
cardiovascular aetiology (stroke, transient ischaemic attack, dementia) 
and conditions in which respiratory function may be compromised, 
such as motor neurone disease, myasthenia gravis, multiple sclerosis, 
Parkinson's disease, cerebral palsy, quadriplegia or hemiplegia and 
progressive cerebellar disease. Asplenia included splenectomy or a 
spleen dysfunction, including sickle cell disease. Other immunosup￾pressive conditions included human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or 
a condition inducing permanent immunodeficiency ever diagnosed, 
or aplastic anaemia or temporary immunodeficiency recorded within 
the last year. Haematological malignancies were considered separately 
from other cancers to reflect the immunosuppression associated with 
haematological malignancies and their treatment. Kidney function 
was ascertained from the most recent serum creatinine measurement, 
where available, and was converted into the eGFR using the chronic 
kidney disease epidemiology collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation35, with 
reduced kidney function grouped into eGFR 30–59.9 or <30 ml min−1
per 1.73 m2
. History of kidney dialysis or end-stage renal failure was 

Article
separately explored in a secondary analysis. Raised blood pressure 
was defined as either a previous coded diagnosis of hypertension or 
the most recent recording indicating systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 
mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mm Hg.
Asthma was grouped by use of oral corticosteroids as an indica￾tion of severity. Diabetes was grouped according to the most recent 
Hba1c measurement within the last 15 months (Hba1c < 58 mmol mol−1; 
Hba1c ≥ 58 mmol mol−1; or no recent measure available). Cancer was 
grouped by time since the first diagnosis (within the last year; between 
1 and 4.9 years ago; more than 5 years ago).
Other covariates that were considered as potential upstream factors 
were deprivation and ethnicity. Deprivation was measured by the index 
of multiple deprivation (IMD, in quintiles, with higher values indicat￾ing greater deprivation), derived from the patient’s postcode at lower 
super output area level for a high degree of precision. Ethnicity was 
grouped into white, Black, South Asian, mixed, or other. In sensitivity 
analyses, a more detailed grouping of ethnicity was explored. The Sus￾tainability and Transformation Partnership (STP, an NHS administrative 
region) of the patient’s general practice was included as an additional 
adjustment for geographical variation in infection rates across the 
country.
Information on all covariates was obtained from primary care records 
by searching TPP SystmOne records for specific coded data. TPP Syst￾mOne allows users to work with the SNOMED-CT clinical terminology, 
using a GP subset of SNOMED-CT codes. This subset maps on to the 
native Read version 3 (CTV3) clinical coding system on which SystmOne 
is built. Medicines are entered or prescribed in a format compliant 
with the NHS Dictionary of Medicines and Devices (dm+d)36, a local 
UK extension library of SNOMED. Codelists for particular underlying 
conditions and medicines were compiled from a variety of sources. 
These include British National Formulary (BNF) codes from OpenPre￾scribing.net, published codelists for asthma37–39, immunosuppres￾sion40–42, psoriasis43, systemic lupus erythematosus44, rheumatoid 
arthritis45,46 and cancer47,48, and Read Code 2 lists designed specifically 
to describe groups who are at increased risk of influenza infection18. 
Read Code 2 lists were added to with SNOMED codes and cross-checked 
against NHS Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) registers, then 
translated into CTV3 with manual curation. Decisions on every codelist 
were documented and the final lists were reviewed by at least two 
authors. Detailed information on compilation and sources for every 
individual codelist is available at https://codelists.opensafely.org/ and 
the lists are available for inspection and reuse by the broader research 
community.
Statistical analysis
Patient numbers are depicted in a flowchart (Fig. 1). The Kaplan–Meier 
failure function was estimated by age group and sex. For each patient 
characteristic, a Cox proportional hazards model was fitted, with days 
in study as the timescale, stratified by geographical area (STP), and 
adjusted for sex and age modelled using restricted cubic splines. Viola￾tions of the proportional hazards assumption were explored by testing 
for a zero slope in the scaled Schoenfeld residuals. All patient charac￾teristics, including age (again modelled as a spline), sex, BMI, smoking, 
IMD quintile, and comorbidities listed above were then included in a 
single multivariable Cox proportional hazards model, stratified by 
STP. Hazard ratios from the age-and-sex adjusted and fully adjusted 
models are reported with 95% confidence intervals. Models were also 
refitted with age group fitted as a categorical variable to obtain hazard 
ratios by age group.
In the primary analysis, those with missing BMI were assumed to be 
non-obese and those with missing smoking information were assumed 
to be non-smokers on the assumption that both obesity and smoking 
would be likely to be recorded if present. A sensitivity analysis was 
run among those with complete BMI and smoking data only. Ethnic￾ity was omitted from the main multivariable model owing data being 
missing for 26% of individuals; hazard ratios for ethnicity were therefore 
obtained from a separate model among individuals with complete eth￾nicity data only. Hazard ratios for other patient characteristics, adjusted 
for ethnicity, were also obtained from this model and are presented 
in the sensitivity analyses to allow assessment of whether estimates 
were distorted by ethnicity in the primary model. We conducted an 
additional sensitivity analysis using a population-calibrated imputation 
approach to handle missing ethnicity49,50, with marginal proportions of 
each ethnicity group within each of nine broad geographical regions of 
England (East, East Midlands, London, North East, North West, South 
East, South West, West Midlands, Yorkshire and The Humber) taken 
from Annual Population Survey (APS) data (pooled 2014–2016)51. Five 
imputed datasets were created with estimated hazard ratios combined 
using Rubin’s rules.
The C-statistic was calculated as a measure of model discrimina￾tion. Owing to computational time, this was estimated by randomly 
sampling 5,000 patients with and without the outcome and calculat￾ing the C-statistic using the random sample, repeating this 10 times 
and taking the average C-statistic. Weights were applied to account 
for the sampling56.
All P values presented are two-sided.
Information governance and ethics
NHS England is the data controller; TPP is the data processor; and the 
key researchers on OpenSAFELY are acting on behalf of NHS England. 
This implementation of OpenSAFELY is hosted within the TPP envi￾ronment, which is accredited to the ISO 27001 information security 
standard and is NHS IG Toolkit compliant52,53; patient data have been 
pseudonymized for analysis and linkage using industry standard cryp￾tographic hashing techniques; all pseudonymized datasets transmitted 
for linkage onto OpenSAFELY are encrypted; access to the platform 
is through a virtual private network (VPN) connection, restricted to 
a small group of researchers, their specific machine and IP address; 
the researchers hold contracts with NHS England and only access the 
platform to initiate database queries and statistical models; all data￾base activity is logged; and only aggregate statistical outputs leave 
the platform environment following best practice for anonymization 
of results such as statistical disclosure control for low cell counts54. 
The OpenSAFELY research platform adheres to the data protection 
principles of the UK Data Protection Act 2018 and the EU General Data 
Protection Regulation (GDPR) 2016. In March 2020, the Secretary of 
State for Health and Social Care used powers under the UK Health 
Service (Control of Patient Information) Regulations 2002 (COPI) to 
require organizations to process confidential patient information for 
the purposes of protecting public health, providing healthcare services 
to the public and monitoring and managing the COVID-19 outbreak 
and incidents of exposure55. Together, these provide the legal bases 
to link patient datasets on the OpenSAFELY platform. GP practices, 
from which the primary care data are obtained, are required to share 
relevant health information to support the public health response to 
the pandemic, and have been informed of the OpenSAFELY analytics 
platform. This study was approved by the Health Research Authority 
(REC reference 20/LO/0651) and by the London School of Hygiene and 
Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) ethics board (reference 21863). No further 
ethical or research governance approval was required by the University 
of Oxford but copies of the approval documents were reviewed and 
held on record. Guarantor: B.G. and L.S.
Patient and public involvement
Patients were not formally involved in developing this specific study 
design. We have developed a publicly available website (https://
opensafely.org/) that allows any patient or member of the public to 
contact us regarding this study or the broader OpenSAFELY project. 
This feedback will be used to refine and prioritize our OpenSAFELY 
activities.

Reporting summary
Further information on research design is available in the Nature 
Research Reporting Summary linked to this paper.
Data availability
All data were linked, stored and analysed securely within the Open￾SAFELY platform (https://opensafely.org/). Detailed pseudonymized 
patient data are potentially reidentifiable and therefore not shared. 
We rapidly delivered the OpenSAFELY data analysis platform without 
prior funding to deliver timely analyses on urgent research questions 
in the context of the global COVID-19 health emergency: now that the 
platform is established we are developing a formal process for external 
users to request access in collaboration with NHS England. Details of 
this process will be published shortly on the OpenSAFELY website.
Code availability
Data management was performed using Python 3.8 and SQL, with analy￾sis carried out using Stata 16.1 and Python. All code is shared openly for 
review and reuse under an MIT open license. All code for data manage￾ment and analysis is archived online at https://github.com/opensafely/
risk-factors-research. All clinical and medicines codelists are openly 
available for inspection and reuse at https://codelists.opensafely.org/.

Study description We conducted a quantitative cohort study using national primary care electronic health record data linked to COVID-19 death data.
Research sample We used patient data from general practice (GP) records managed by the GP software provider The Phoenix Partnership (TPP), linked 
to Office for National Statistics (ONS) death data. The sample of patients represents approximately 40% of the population of England, 
spread geographically across the whole country.
Sampling strategy Our study population consisted of all adults (males and females 18 years and above) currently registered as active patients in a TPP 
general practice in England on 1st February 2020. To be included in the study, participants were required to have at least 1 year of 
prior follow-up in the GP practice to ensure that baseline patient characteristics could be adequately captured, and to have recorded 
sex, age, and deprivation (see covariates, below).
Data collection Data were collected by clinicians (e.g. doctors, nurses) and administrative staff, for the purpose of direct clinical care. This was 
carried out on computers using TPP SystmOne software. The researchers were not present for data collection into the TPP database. 
Data were then queried from the TPP database by the researchers, to create the study dataset. This was carried out using Python 3.8 
and SQL software (available here https://github.com/opensafely/risk-factors-research). This study did not have an experimental 
condition or hypothesis.
Timing Patients were observed from the 1st of February 2020 and were followed until the first of either their death date (whether COVID-19 
related or due to other causes) or the study end date, 6th May 2020.
Data exclusions To be included in the study, participants were required to have at least 1 year of prior follow-up in the GP practice to ensure that 
baseline patient characteristics could be adequately captured, and to have recorded sex, age, and deprivation. The total number of 
excluded patients was 6,322,225.
Non-participation No participants dropped out.
Randomization Participants were not allocated into experimental groups.
Reporting for specific materials, systems and methods

Recruitment This study uses data gathered during routine medical practice. We selected all patients except those <18 years old, anyone 
without a recorded sex, age, or deprivation score, and anyone without a year of prior follow-up (to ensure that baseline 
patient characteristics could be adequately captured). These inclusive criteria mean that bias is minimised.

Ethics oversight This study was approved by the Health Research Authority (REC reference 20/LO/0651) and by the LSHTM Ethics Board 
(reference 21863). 
In March 2020, the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care used powers under the UK Health Service (Control of Patient 
Information) Regulations 2002 (COPI) to require organisations to process confidential patient information for the purposes of 
protecting public health, providing healthcare services to the public and monitoring and managing the COVID-19 outbreak 
and incidents of exposure. Taken together, these provide the legal bases to link patient datasets on the OpenSAFELY platform 
and set aside the requirement for patient consent for COVID-19 related public health research. GP practices, from which the 
primary care data is obtained, are required to share relevant health information to support the public health response to the 
pandemic, and have been informed of the OpenSAFELY analytics platform.
Note that full information on the approval of the study protocol must also be provided in the manuscript.
