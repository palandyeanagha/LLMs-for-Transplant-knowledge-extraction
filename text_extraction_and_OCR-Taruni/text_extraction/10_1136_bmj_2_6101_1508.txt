incidence and severity of gastric erosions would clearly be
minimised if drugs with an erosive influence (corticosteroids)
were used sparingly and azathioprine and other cytotoxic drugs
that may contribute a bleeding tendency (actinomycin C,
cyclophosphamide, antilymphocyte globulin) given in as low a
dosage as possible. Patients should also be warned of the danger
of aspirin-containing preparations.14 Fibreoptic endoscopy and
measurement of gastric acidity are therefore necessary to identify
patients likely to benefit from prophylactic use of an antisecre￾tory drug, and attention to immunosuppressive drug regimens
is equally important. This seems preferable to prophylactic
surgery, which is the policy in some dialysis centres.'5 16
In conclusion, cimetidine may prove to be a considerable
advance in the management of peptic ulcer in the uraemic patient
and also in the prevention of upper gastrointestinal complica￾tions after transplantation.

Glutamate dehydrogenase: a reliable marker of liver cell
necrosis in the alcoholic.
LENA VAN WAES, CHARLES S LIEBER
British Medical_Journal, 1977, 2, 1508-1510
Summary
The usefulness of blood enzyme determinations as
markers of liver necrosis was tested in 100 alcoholics who
underwent biopsy during clinical investigation. Mean
values of glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), serum
aspartate and alanine transferase (SGOT and SGPT),
ornithine carbamoyltransferase (OCT), and gamma￾glutamyltranspeptidase (gamma-GTP) tended to rise
with increasing liver cell necrosis, though values of
SGOT, SGPT, OCT, and gamma-GTP showed con￾siderable overlap between the 32 patients with histo￾logically proved hepatitis and the 68 without. By contrast,
GDH values showed virtually no overlap between patients
with and without hepatitis, and a value of two and a half
times the normal value discriminated between the two
groups.
Because of its easy determination and its reliable
reflection of liver cell necrosis the GDH concentration
should be estimated routinely in alcoholic patients.

Liver cell necrosis is considered to represent an important factor

in the progression of liver disease. Since repeat biopsies are
impracticable for monitoring purposes, spill-over into the blood
of the so-called liver enzymes, especially transaminases, is
commonly used as a marker of liver cell necrosis. In the follow-up
of patients with alcoholic liver disease, however, this approach
has proved to be unsatisfactory. Blood transaminase con￾centrations are a poor reflection of liver cell necrosis.' In alco￾holic hepatitis, for example, concentrations of transaminases
are only moderately raised and normal values are occasionally
found.2 Moreover, transaminases are not liver-specific and
raised concentrations may reflect, at least partly, damage to
other organs. -'-Glutamyltranspeptidase (y(-GTP) was recently
suggested to be a useful marker of alcoholic liver disease.
But although there is some correlation between raised y-GTP
concentrations and liver cell necrosis,4 raised concentrations
may reflect only microsomal induction by alcohol in some
cases,5- and increases produced by non-hepatic causes are
common.
In an attempt to find a more suitable marker of liver necrosis
in alcoholics, we focused on glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH)
for various reasons. Firstly, it occurs predominantly in the liver,
where its concentration (U/g protein) is 17 times that found
in heart muscle, 80 times that found in skeletal muscle, and
28 times that found in pancreas.8 Secondly, its activity is 17
times greater in the centrolobular part of the liver, where alco￾holic liver injury produces its major effects,9 than in the
peripheral portion of the liver lobule. Thirdly, the enzyme
is exclusively intramitochondrial, and mitochondrial damage
due to alcohol has been documented."0
We tested the usefulness of GDH values in alcoholics by
correlating the degree of liver cell necrosis with the blood enzyme
value determined on the day of biopsy. Results were compared
with those determined by estimating concentrations of con￾ventional enzymes. Protected by copyright, including for uses related to text and data mining, AI training, and similar technologies.

Patients and methods
One hundred alcoholic inpatients (82 men and 18 women; average
ethanol intake 90-180 g/day) who had undergone liver biopsy as
part of their clinical investigation were studied. The main reasons for
admission were problems related to heavy drinking (delirium tremens
or entering a detoxification programme) in 54 patients, gastritis after
an alcoholic binge in four, liver-related symptoms (jaundice, ascites)
in 33, and miscellaneous conditions (hypertension, ulcer disease,
malnutrition) in nine. In 14 patients the presence of alcoholic hepatitis
was suspected clinically-that is, the patient was suffering from
general deterioration, weight loss, nausea, jaundice, and tender
hepatomegaly, with or without fever. In all patients the presence of
either symptoms and physical signs incriminating the liver, or
increased serum transaminase values with or without raised serum
bilirubin and y-globulin concentrations, or both, indicated the need
for a liver biopsy. None of the patients had overt clinical heart
disease, symptomatic myopathy, or pancreatitis, which might have
contributed to blood enzyme abnormalities. In all patients blood was
drawn for enzyme analysis 30 minutes to four hours before the liver
biopsy was performed (by the Menghini or Trucut technique).
Histology-Biopsy specimens were interpreted blindly without
knowledge of the patient's identity or blood enzymes. Sections stained
with haematoxylin and eosin and trichrome-stained sections were
examined for the presence of fat, inflammation, fibrosis, necrosis, and
Mallory's hyalin. Twelve patients were diagnosed as having a
normal liver, 44 a fatty liver without parenchymal fibrosis, 10 fibrosis,
and 34 cirrhosis. All patients with fibrosis and cirrhosis also had some
degree of fat infiltration. Typical Mallory bodies were present in 18.
The degree of necrosis was graded as follows: 0-absence of necrosis
and parenchymal inflammation; 1-occasional cell drop-out, often
shown by the inflammatory reaction, usually mononuclear in type;
2-scattered foci of necrotic cells in the parenchyma with poly￾morphonuclear infiltration predominantly in the centrolobular area
("mild alcoholic hepatitis"); 3-diffuse parenchymal necrosis with
polymorphonuclear infiltrates ("frank alcoholic hepatitis"). The
interpretations of the biopsy specimens made independently by the
1509
hospital pathologists concurred well with our diagnoses in that none
of the patients with grade 1 necrosis were classified as having alcoholic
hepatitis, whereas most of those with grades 2 and 3 were so diagnosed.
Serum enzymes-Plasma was separated immediately and haemolysed
samples were discarded. Samples were stored at - 18°C until they
were analysed, one to five days after the collection. The following
enzymes were determined at 37°C in duplicate by standard laboratory
techniques: aspartate transaminase (SGOT), alanine transaminase
(SGPT)," y-GTP," GDH,'3 and ornithine carbamoyltransferase
(OCT)14; the latter was determined in only 86 of the 100 subjects.
The activity of y-GTP, OCT, and GDH was not affected by this
short storage period and the maximum decrease in transaminase
activity was 80% of the original value. Enzyme control samples both
for normal and raised enzyme concentrations (Sigma enzyme control
2N and 2E) were run with each batch of determinations of trans￾aminases and y-GTP, and values were accepted only if they yielded
results within 10% of the manufacturer's quoted values. For GDH
and OCT we prepared a serum pool and used this as control.
Normal values for our laboratory were determined in a group of 30
controls (12 healthy laboratory workers and 18 non-alcoholic patients
with normal routine laboratory test results and without clinical or
other evidence of liver diseases or pancreatic, cardiac, and muscle
wasting disorders). The upper limits of normal, defined as 2 SD above
the mean in the control group, were: SGOT 27 IU/l, SGPT 22 IU/l,
y-GPT 54 IU/1, OCT 0 47 IU/1, and GDH 4-5 IU/l. According to
this definition raised (false-positive) values were found in the control
group as follows: SGOT concentrations were raised in two controls,
SGPT in one, y-GTP in two, GDH in two, and OCT in none.
All these false-positive values were, however, still within 3 SD above
the mean.
Statistics-Since values for the serum enzymes were not normally
distributed, logarithmic conversion of these results was carried out
before statistical calculations. Analysis of variance was performed for
each of the enzyme values to compare the means in the four groups.
Linear contrasts were used to test specific group comparisons, and
the significance of these contrasts was tested by Scheffe's multiple
comparison procedure.'5

The frequency of the false-positive enzyme values in the control
group and the alcoholics was compared by the x2 test.
Results
Raised enzyme concentrations were found in most of our alcoholic
inpatients: 58 had raised SGOT, 57 raised SGPT, 72 raised y-GTP,
41 (48 %) raised OCT, and 53 raised GDH concentrations. The
correlation of the different enzymes with the degree of liver cell
necrosis on biopsy is given in the figure.
PATIENTS WITHOUT NECROSIS AND INFLAMMATION
Thirty-seven patients (12 with a normal liver, 14 with steatosis,
2 with fibrosis, and 9 with cirrhosis) had no evidence of liver cell
necrosis or parenchymal inflammation on liver biopsy. For all
enzymes studied the mean values in this group were not significantly
different from those in the control group (P0005). Abnormal
concentrations were found in 8 patients (22 %) for SGOT, 10 (27 %o)
for SGPT, 13 (35 %) for y-GTP, 3 (8 %) for GDH, and 4 out of 33
(12 %) for OCT. This prevalence of false-positive values was sig￾nificant for SGPT (P <001) and y-GTP (P <0005). Raised con￾centrations were only borderline for SGPT, OCT, and GDH but
reached much higher values for SGOT and y-GTP.
PATIENTS WITH NECROSIS AND INFLAMMATION
According to the proposed classification 31 patients had grade 1,
18 had grade 2, and 14 had grade 3 necrosis and inflammation.
Among the 32 patients with alcoholic hepatitis proved on biopsy
(grade 2 or 3 necrosis and inflammation) only 14 were clinically
suspected of having the condition.
False-negative enzyme values among all those with some necrosis
and inflammation were obtained in 13 patients (21 %) for GDH,
18 (34O% of 53) for OCT, 13 (21O%) for SGOT, and 16 (25 %) for
SGPT. Only four patients (6%) had false-negative y-GTP values.
Except for one patient with a low y-GTP concentration;-and one with a
low SGOT concentration false-negative values were always found -in
the group with grade 1 necrosis and inflammation.
For all enzymes studied there was a tendency for the mean values to
rise with increasing liver cell necrosis, and values in patients with mild
or frank alcoholic hepatitis (grades 2 and 3) were significantly higher
than those in patients without hepatitis (P < 0 05). As is clear from the
figure, however, individual values of SGOT, SGPT, y-GTP, and,
to a lesser extent, OCT showed a considerable overlap between the
different groups and did not discriminate between individuals with
and without hepatitis. For example, serum SGOT concentrations
of 50 IU/l were found in patients without necrosis as well as in those
with occasional cell drop-out or those with frank alcoholic hepatitis.
By contrast, GDH did not show such an overlap (mean (+2SD)
5-3+4 74 in those with grade 1 necrosis v 18 7±8-2 in those with
grade 2). A serum concentration below 12 IU/l (2-5 times normal)
ruled out the diagnosis of alcoholic hepatitis as defined by the criteria
used in this study and the independent reading of the hospital patholo￾gists: a level above 12 IU/l was always associated with significant
necrosis and inflammation (F ratio for discriminant function 219 95;
P < 0 005). By using GDH alone, only one misclassification occurred
and combining GDH with SGOT ruled out all misclassification in the
population studied. GDH had the same discriminatory capacity
in the group that was admitted predominantly for alcohol-related
symptoms as in the group admitted for liver-related symptoms.
On the other hand, neither GDH nor any of the other enzymes
studied indicated the stage of the chronic liver disease, and values
in patients with fatty liver were not significantly different from those
with cirrhosis for the same degree of liver cell necrosis. Mallory bodies
were found only in patients with grade 2 or 3 necrosis. Within these
groups there was no significant difference in the GDH values of
subjects with and without Mallory bodies (for comparable degrees of
inflammation and necrosis).
Discussion
We have shown the superiority of GDH as a biochemical
marker of liver necrosis in the alcoholic. Not only did the mean
plasma concentration of GDH rise with increasing liver cell
necrosis but, unlike other enzymes, individual concentrations
of GDH also clearly discriminated between patients with and
without necrosis associated with polymorphonuclear inflam￾mation (alcoholic hepatitis). GDH concentrations also detected
cases of alcoholic hepatitis that were clinically silent. The
usefulness of this test is further enhanced by its few false￾positive results. Thus, in our series of alcoholics without clinic￾ally manifest heart disease, myopathy, or pancreatitis, raised
concentrations were less common for GDH than for the other
enzymes and all fell in the borderline range.
The predominantly centrolobular intrahepatic localisation
of GDH may help to explain the sensitivity of this enzyme in
alcoholic liver injury. Indeed, this type of liver disease is
characterised by predominantly centrolobular liver injury, and
the associated raised GDH is consistent with the observation
of high GDH levels in non-alcoholics with acute right-sided
heart failure and extensive centrolobular necrosis on liver
biopsy. 9
Results somewhat similar to those obtained for GDH were
observed with OCT, another mitochondrial enzyme with a
high degree of specificity for the liver. But OCT discriminated
between patients with and without alcoholic hepatitis less well
than GDH, and the more elaborate technique required for its
determination makes it less suitable for routine laboratory use.
None of the enzymes reflected the chronic underlying liver
damage, and liver biopsy was required to discriminate with
certainty between fatty liver and cirrhosis.
The practical implications of this study are obvious. Because
of the technical simplicity of determining GDH and its reliable
reflection of liver cell necrosis in the individual alcoholic,
estimation of GDH should be included in the investigation of
chronic alcoholics. Knowledge of the blood concentration of
this enzyme improves our ability to identify patients with active
alcoholic liver disease (including those who are asymptomatic)
and hence to concentrate our therapeutic effort on those
patients.
