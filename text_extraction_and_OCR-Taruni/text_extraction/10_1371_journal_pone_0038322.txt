Abstract
Background: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) includes a broad range of liver pathologies from simple steatosis to
cirrhosis and fibrosis, in which a subtype accompanying hepatocyte degeneration and fibrosis is classified as nonalcoholic
steatohepatitis (NASH). NASH accounts for approximately 10–30% of NAFLD and causes a higher frequency of liver-related
death, and its progression of NASH has been considered to be complex involving multiple genetic factors interacting with
the environment and lifestyle.
Principal Findings: To identify genetic factors related to NAFLD in the Japanese, we performed a genome-wide association
study recruiting 529 histologically diagnosed NAFLD patients and 932 population controls. A significant association was
observed for a cluster of SNPs in PNPLA3 on chromosome 22q13 with the strongest p-value of 1.4610210 (OR = 1.66, 95%CI:
1.43–1.94) for rs738409. Rs738409 also showed the strongest association (p = 3.661026
) with the histological classifications
proposed by Matteoni and colleagues based on the degree of inflammation, ballooning degeneration, fibrosis and Mallory￾Denk body. In addition, there were marked differences in rs738409 genotype distributions between type4 subgroup
corresponding to NASH and the other three subgroups (p = 4.861026
, OR = 1.96, 95%CI: 1.47–2.62). Moreover, a subgroup
analysis of NAFLD patients against controls showed a significant association of rs738409 with type4 (p = 1.7610216,
OR = 2.18, 95%CI: 1.81–2.63) whereas no association was obtained for type1 to type3 (p = 0.41). Rs738409 also showed
strong associations with three clinical traits related to the prognosis of NAFLD, namely, levels of hyaluronic acid
(p = 4.661024
), HbA1c (p = 0.0011) and iron deposition in the liver (p = 5.661024
).
Conclusions: With these results we clearly demonstrated that Matteoni type4 NAFLD is both a genetically and clinically
different subset from the other spectrums of the disease and that the PNPLA3 gene is strongly associated with the
progression of NASH in Japanese population.

Introduction
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) includes a broad
range of pathologies from fatty liver (simple steatosis), steatone￾crosis, and steatohepatitis to cirrhosis [1–3]. NAFLD often
accompanies other lifestyle-related pathologies of metabolic
syndrome such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension and dyslipide￾mia, and the number of NAFLD patients is increasing worldwide
along with the escalation in the incidence of metabolic syndrome
[4]. Prevalence of NAFLD is considered as approximately 8% in
Japanese and 6–35% in Europeans [4,5]. The majority of NAFLD
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 June 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 6 | e38322

shows simple steatosis with a good prognosis, but approximately
10–30% of NAFLD histologically diagnosed as nonalcoholic
steatohepatitis (NASH) shows hepatocyte degeneration (ballooning
hepatocyte), necrosis, inflammation and fibrosis, with a higher
frequency of liver-related death both in Japanese and European
populations [6,7]. Insulin resistance and oxidative stress are
considered to be key players in the progression of NASH [8,9].
However, the progression of NASH has been considered to be
complex involving multiple genetic factors interacting with the
environment and lifestyle, because only a portion of NAFLD
patients develops NASH.
The first Genome-wide association (GWA) study searching for
such genetic factors identified the PNPLA3 gene as a major genetic
determinant for the predisposition to NAFLD in Hispanic, African
American and European American populations according to liver
fat contents [10], which was subsequently confirmed in Europeans
and Asians according to liver biopsy. Association of PNPLA3 with
not only fatty liver and TG content, but also inflammation and
fibrosis were shown in the subsequent studies, so PNPLA3 may be
widely associated with the development of NAFLD [11–13]. More
recently, another GWA study reported the association of four
additional genes with NAFLD in Europeans [14]. Also, a
candidate gene-based approach revealed the association between
NAFLD and the apolipoprotein C3 gene in Indians [15].
However, the precise role of such genes in the development of
NASH still remains to be elucidated. In addition, no GWA study
has been reported for Asian populations to date although the
genetic components and their relative contribution may be
different between ethnicities.
The Japan NASH Study Group was founded in 2008 aiming at
the identification of genetic determinants predisposing to NASH in
the Japanese population. Here we report the first GWA study of
NAFLD in the Japanese using DNA samples of patients with liver
histology-based diagnoses recruited through this multi-institutional
research network.
Results
Genome-wide Association Analysis of NAFLD in Japanese
We conducted a GWA study using DNA samples of 543
patients with NAFLD and 942 controls. After quality controls of
genotyping results (see materials and methods for details), a total
of 529 patients consisting of four NAFLD subgroups according
to Matteoni’s classification [2] (type1; 100, type2; 73, type3; 29,
type4; 327) and 932 controls were subjected to statistical
analyses (Table 1). This index pathologically classifies NAFLD
according to the degree of inflammation, hepatocyte degener￾ation, and the existence of fibrosis and Mallory-Denk body in
the liver. Genome scan results of 932 DNA samples collected
for other genetic studies were used as general Japanese
population controls [16]. After standard quality control proce￾dure as described in materials and methods, genotype distribu￾tions of 484,751 autosomal SNP markers were compared
between the NAFLD cases and control subjects by exact trend
test. A slight inflation of p-values was observed by genomic
control method (l = 1.04) (Figure S1).
We identified six SNP markers located at chromosome 22q13
showing genome-wide significance (p,1.0461027
) (Figure 1).
Among them, four SNPs, namely, rs2896019, rs926633,
rs2076211 and rs1010023, located in the PNPLA3 gene and in
strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) (r2
.0.93), returned p-values
smaller than 161029 (p= 1.5610210, 7.5610210, 1.461029 and
1.561029
, respectively) (Table 2). Rs738407 and rs3810662 also
located in PNPLA3 showed significant but weaker associations
(p= 1.061027 and 1.061027
, respectively) than the above four
SNP markers. Rs738491, rs2073082, rs3761472, rs2235776,
rs2143571 and rs6006473 were in the neighboring SAMM50 gene
which is outside of the linkage disequilibrium (LD) block where the
top SNP markers were distributed (Figure 2). These markers were
in moderate LD with each other (r2
.0.42) and showed p-values
between 3.961026 and 6.461027 but did not reach genome-wide
significance (Table S1). Rs738409, the SNP which showed the
strongest association with NAFLD in the first GWA study [10],
was not included in the SNP array used in our study. This SNP
was therefore genotyped using Taqman technology in the same
case and control samples that were used for genome scan.
Rs738409 showed the strongest association with the disease
(p= 1.4610210, OR = 1.66, 95%CI: 1.43–1.94) among all the
SNP markers examined in this study. The association remained
after the correction for population stratification with EIGEN￾STRAT [17] (p= 2.3610211). Although a peak consisting of a
cluster of SNPs was observed at the HLA locus on chromosome 6
(minimal p-value of 4.1061027 for rs9262639 located at the 39 of
C6orf15 gene), the association disappeared when EIGENSTRAT
was applied (p.1.661023
). We consider this as a result of
population stratification between the cases and controls.
Impact of PNPLA3 Polymorphisms to the Pathogenicity of
NAFLD
We next examined whether or not the seven SNPs in the
PNPLA3 gene were associated with the pathogenic status of
NAFLD. The genotype distributions of these SNPs were
compared by Jonckheere-Terpstra test among the four subgroups
of NAFLD patients categorized by Matteoni’s classification (type1
to type4). There was a significant increase in the frequency of the
risk allele from Matteoni type1 to type4 for all of the seven SNPs
(p-values ranging from 3.661026 to 0.0017) (Table 2). Among
them, rs738409 again showed the strongest association
(p= 3.661026
) as seen in the simple case/control analysis. On
the other hand, there was no significant association between
control and Matteoni type1 (p= 0.76).
In order to clarify how rs738409 influences the pathogenicity of
NAFLD, we performed pairwise comparisons of genotype
distributions in the four subgroups of NAFLD patients. There
were marked differences in genotype distributions between type4
subgroup and the other three subgroups by multivariable logistic
regression adjusted for age, sex and body mass index (BMI)
(p= 2.061025
, OR = 2.18, 95%CI: 1.52–3.18 between type1 and
type4; p = 1.461023
, OR = 1.81, 95%CI: 1.26–2.62 between
type2 and type4; p = 0.027, OR = 1.85, 95%CI: 1.07–3.19
between type3 and type4) (Figure 3). On the other hand, no
significant associations were obtained for type1 to type3 in any
combinations. When we performed the same analysis between
type4 and the pooled genotypes of type1 to type3, we again
obtained a significant difference (p= 4.861026
, OR = 1.96,
95%CI: 1.47–2.62).
We further examined the specific association of rs738409 with
type4 subgroup by using the case/control association results of the
initial genome scan. 529 NAFLD patients were divided into 202
patients with type1 to type3 and 327 patients with type4, and
genotype distributions of rs738409 in each subgroup were
compared with those of 932 control subjects. Exact trend test
returned an extremely strong association of rs738409 with type4
subgroup (p= 1.7610216, OR = 2.18, 95%CI: 1.81–2.63) whereas
no association was obtained for type1 to type3 subgroups
(p= 0.41).

Association of rs738409 Genotypes with Clinical Traits
The quantitative effects of rs738409 genotypes to clinical traits
were examined by multivariable regression adjusted for age, sex
and BMI (statistical calculation 1, Table 3). Five categorical
ordinals, namely, anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), Brunt grade,
Brunt stage, fat deposition and iron deposition, were also tested
by an ordinal logistic regression analysis. Potential associations
(p,0.05) were obtained for 11 traits, namely, aspartate transam￾inase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), type IV collagen
7S, hyaluronic acid, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), fasting immuno￾reactive insulin (IRI), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), platelet count
(PLT), Brunt grade, fat deposition and iron deposition (Table 3).
When the results were further adjusted for Matteoni type
(statistical calculation 2), AST, hyaluronic acid, HbA1c, FPG,

PLT, Brunt grade and iron deposition showed p-values smaller
than 0.05. The level of serum triglyceride was not significant in
the initial analysis, but became significant after being adjusted for
Matteoni’s type (p= 0.013). Among them, only three traits,
namely, hyaluronic acid, HbA1c and iron deposition, remained
significant (p,0.0021) after Bonferroni’s correction for multiple
testing (Table 3).
Associations of Previously Reported SNPs with NAFLD
Previous genetic studies identified four chromosomal loci,
namely, LYPLAL1 at 1q41, GCKR at 2p23, NCAN at 19p12 and
PPP1R3B at 8p23.1, associated with NAFLD in populations of
European descent [14]. We examined whether or not the
associations were reproduced in the Japanese population by
extracting genotype information of SNP markers corresponding to
these four loci. As shown in Table 4, the association of rs780094 in
GCKR with NAFLD was at the border of significance (p = 0.011,
OR = 0.82, 95%CI: 0.70–0.91) in the case/control analysis.
However, the association was lost when examined between
rs780094 genotypes and Matteoni types. There were no associ￾ations of rs2228603 in NCAN and rs12137855 in LYPLAL1 with
either NAFLD or Matteoni types. Rs4240624 in PPP1R3B was not
in the SNP array used for this study, and this marker was not
polymorphic or at a very low frequency in the Japanese (0 in 90

Discussion
NASH is a type of hepatic steatosis in NAFLD with poor
prognosis accompanying liver fibrosis, and subsequent liver
cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma [18]. Despite the extensive
biochemical and histological investigation of NAFLD, whether or
not NASH forms a distinct disease entity in NAFLD still remains
unclear. The principle aim of this study was to identify the genetic
factors related to the pathogenic status of NAFLD by collecting
DNA samples of Japanese NAFLD patients with critically
diagnosed disease status by liver biopsy. To our knowledge, this
is the first GWA study of NAFLD using patients with known
histology-based Matteoni type. In the initial association study
using pooled genotyping results of all the cases, we found a
significant association of the PNPLA3 gene at chromosome
22q13.31 with NAFLD in the Japanese. Rs738409 which showed
the strongest association with NAFLD in the GWA study of
Caucasians was also genotyped and its strongest association with
NAFLD was confirmed. These results were in agreement with the
former GWA analyses in populations of European descent and in
Hispanics, giving strong evidence of the involvement of PNPLA3 in
NAFLD beyond ethnicities. Rs738409 is located in exon3 of the
PNPLA3 gene which is expressed in the liver and adipose tissue.
This SNP introduces an amino acid substitution from isoleucine to
methionine (I148M), and biological studies demonstrated that its
risk allele (G) abolishes the triglyceride hydrolysis activity of
PNPLA3 [19]. These observations strongly suggest rs738409 to be
a causative genetic variation for NAFLD. However, future
genomic analyses by fine mapping or extensive sequencing may
identify additional genetic determinants within the PNPLA3 locus.
In the current study we did not find other genetic loci showing
genome-wide significance (p,1.061027
). However, two additional
chromosomal loci with p-values being smaller than 161025 were

identified on chromosome 1p (rs11206226) and chromosome 4p
(rs1390096) neither of which has been reported as being associated
with NAFLD in Caucasians (Table S1). Statistical calculation by
taking their allele frequencies and effect sizes into account showed
that approximately three times as many case and control samples
are required to obtain sufficient statistical power (.0.8) for
genome wide significance. Hence, further confirmation is required
using a larger collection of patients and controls although they
may be potential candidates of low-penetrance genes for
susceptibility to NAFLD in Japanese.
Subsequent analyses through comparison of genotype distribu￾tion among four subgroups of NAFLD (type1 to type4) categorized
by Matteoni’s classification revealed that the seven NAFLD￾associated SNPs in the PNPLA3 gene were also significantly
associated with the pathogenic status of NAFLD. There were also
marked differences in genotype distribution of rs738409 between
type4 subgroup and the other three groups (p = 4.861026
,
OR = 1.96, 95%CI: 1.47–2.62 between type4 and pooled geno￾types of type1 to type3). Moreover, a case/control analysis of
rs738409 between Matteoni type4 and controls returned a
surprisingly strong association (p= 1.7610216) which was much
stronger than the initial analysis using all NAFLD cases
(p= 1.4610210), whereas the analysis using Matteoni type1 to
type3 as cases didn’t show significance (p= 0.41). There were
differences in the score of HOMA-IR and hs-CRP, indicators of
insulin resistance and inflammation, respectively, between Mat￾teoni type1 to type3 and type4 subgroups (Table 1). Our results
provide compelling evidence that NASH corresponding to
Matteoni type4 is both a clinically and genetically different disease
subset from other spectrums of NAFLD. Previous studies showed
association between PNPLA3 and fatty liver, inflammation, fibrosis
grade and NASH [13]. In our result, strong association between
rs738409 and fatty liver was not observed by comparing control
and Matteoni type1. In addition, strong association between
rs738409 and lobular inflammation was not observed by
comparing Matteoni Type1 and Type2. In contrast, a strong
association between rs738409 and NASH was observed. Although
we could not observe the strong association between rs738409 and
fibrosis stage, strong association between rs738409 and Hyaluronic
acid suggests that an association exists between PNPLA3 and
fibrosis.
We have also undertaken association analyses of rs738409 and
clinical traits in the patients. The multivariable regression analysis
adjusted for age, sex, BMI and Matteoni type followed by the
correction for multiple testing revealed hyaluronic acid and
HbA1c as being significantly associated with rs738409. Hyaluronic
acid is one of the principle components of the extracellular matrix
and its involvement in fibrosis has been previously suggested [20].
This may indicate another possible functional involvement of
PNPLA3 in the progression of liver fibrosis by influencing the
circulating hyaluronic acid levels. A weak association of rs738409
and HbA1c levels was observed in our study population. However,
there are no reports to date indicating such an association, and
confirmation with different sample sets is needed for definitive
conclusion. Also, the association between rs738409 and iron
deposition was demonstrated by an ordinal logistic regression
analysis. Since the association still remained after the results were
adjusted with Matteoni type, rs738409 may play a functional role
in the oxidative stress through iron absorption in the liver.
Recently, a genetic analysis of Japanese NAFLD patients was
reported demonstrating a significant association in the increase of
AST, ALT, ferritin levels and fibrosis stage (Brunt stage) and in the
decrease of serum triglyceride with the risk allele (G) of rs738409
[12]. In our study, the association of rs738409 with AST
(p= 1.261024
) and ALT (p= 0.0016) was reproduced and that
of AST still remained after the results were adjusted for Matteoni
type (p = 0.038). No association was observed for ferritin level.
Brunt stage was available for Matteoni type4 patients only in our
study. Although the odds ratio was slightly high (OR = 1.28,
95%CI: 0.95–1.72), it was not possible to examine the association.
In addition, the inverse association of the risk allele of rs738409
with decrease of serum triglyceride was confirmed in our study
(p= 0.013 after being adjusted for Matteoni type). For all of these

biomarkers, however, the significance was lost after the correction
for multiple testing.
A replication analysis of other genetic loci that had been
reported for their association with NAFLD in East coast white
Americans [14] was performed in our sample collection. We
confirmed the association of rs780094 in GCKR with NAFLD in a
case/control analysis but at a much weaker level (p= 0.011,
OR = 0.82, 95%CI: 0.70–0.95) than that shown for the popula￾tions of European-descent. No associations were found for
LYPLAL1 and NCAN loci in our study. There are several reasons
to explain such differences, such as the insufficient statistical power
with a limited number of study subjects in our study due to the
difficulty in the collection of a larger number of histologically
diagnosed NAFLD patients. The difference in genetic background
between the Japanese and Europeans is also conceivable. Indeed,
the risk allele frequency of rs12137855 in LYPLAL1 was 0.944 in
our control subjects but approximately 0.79 in the European
populations [14]. Similarly, there was a difference in the risk allele
frequency of rs2228603 in NCAN (0.049 in Japanese and 0.08 in
Europeans). Rs4240624 in PPP1R3B was not polymorphic in the
Japanese while its risk allele frequency was 0.91 in Europeans.

Study Population
A total of 543 patients histologically diagnosed for NAFLD in
2007–2009 were recruited through the Japan study of Nonalco￾holic Fatty Liver Disease. Biopsy specimens were stained with
H&E and Masson’s trichrome for morphological review and
assessment of fibrosis. Perl’s Prussian blue was performed to
evaluate iron load. Biopsy specimens were reviewed by a
hepatopathologist (T.O). NAFLD patients were classified into
four categories by liver histology according to the classification by
Matteoni et al [2] as follows; type1: fatty liver alone, type2: fat
accumulation and lobular inflammation, type3: fat accumulation
and ballooning degeneration, type4: fat accumulation, ballooning
degeneration, and either Mallory-Denk body or fibrosis. With
these criteria, the 543 patients were classified as type1; 102, type2;
75, type3; 31 and type4; 335. The histological grade and fibrosis
stage were also evaluated by the classification of Brunt et al [21] for
advanced NAFLD cases (type3 and type4) as follows; grade 1:
steatosis involving up to 66% of biopsy, occasional ballooned zone
3 hepatocytes and absence or mild portal chronic inflammation,
grade2: steatosis, ballooning hepatocytes mild to moderate chronic
inflammation, grade3: panacinar steatosis, ballooning and disarray
obvious and mild or portal mild to moderate inflammation, stage1:
perivenular and/or perisinusoidal fibrosis in zone3, stage2:
combined pericellular portal fibrosis, stage3: septal/bridging
fibrosis, stage4: cirrhosis. The degree of fat deposition was
evaluated by amount of fat droplets as observed under the
microscope as follows; 0: ,5%, 1: 5–,10%, 2: 10–,34%, 3: 34–
,67%, 4: .67%. The degree of iron deposition was categorized
by the presence of granules of free iron observed under the
microscope as follows; 0: absence by x400, 1: easily identifiable by
x400 and rarely identifiable by x250, 2: identifiable by x100, 3:
identifiable by x25, 4: identifiable at lower than x25.
Inclusion criteria for NAFLD patients were as follows; (i) no
history of alcoholism, (ii) no history for HBV/HCV/HIV
infection, (iii) diagnosed by liver biopsy, (iv) information regarding
age and BMI available. The sex of two samples was unknown, and
was imputed from the results of the genome scan. As general
Japanese population controls, the genome scan results of 942
healthy Japanese volunteers from Aichi Cancer Center Hospital
and Research Institute were used [22].
Anthropometric and Laboratory Evaluation
We employed conventional methods for the measurement of
anthropometry (height, weight, amount of visceral fat and
abdominal circumscript). BMI was calculated from the measure￾ments. The following biochemical/hematological/immunological
traits were also measured by conventional methods; aspartate
aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), c￾glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), albumin, total bilirubin, cholin￾esterase, type IV collagen 7S, hyaluronic acid, triglyceride, total
cholesterol, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), fasting immunoreactive
insulin (IRI), fasting plasma glucose (FBS), high sensitive CRP (hs￾CRP), adiponectin, leptin, ferritin, uric acid, and platelet (PLT)
count. Anti nuclear antibody (ANA) was measured by ELISA and
categorized by the detection limit in a serial dilution as follows; 0:
,40x, 1: 40–80x, 2: 81–160x, 3: 160x, 4: .320x. Homeostasis
model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was calculated
from the measurements. Patients were assigned a diagnosis of
diabetes mellitus (DM) when they had documented use of oral
hypoglycemic medication, a random glucose level .200 mg/dl, or
FPG .126 mg/dl. Hyperlipidemia was diagnosed with the
cholesterol level being .200 mg/dl and/or triglyceride level
being .160 mg/dl. Hypertension was diagnosed when the patient
was taking antihypertensive medication and/or had a resting
recumbent blood pressure §140/90 mmHg on at least two
occasions.
DNA Preparation
Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood mononu￾clear cells by standard phenol-chloroform extraction and resus￾pended in TE buffer. DNA concentration and purity were
measured with Nanodrop 1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo
Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The samples were stored at
220uC until use.
Genome-wide Genotyping and Quality Control
Genome scan was conducted for 543 patients with NAFLD and
942 healthy subjects using Illumina Human 610-Quad Bead Chip
on a Bead Station 500G Genotyping System (Illumina, Inc., San
Diego, CA, USA) and subjected to the following quality controls.
Initially, ten patients and six control subjects were removed due to
low call rates (,0.99). Regarding the SNP markers, 85,472 SNPs
with minor allele frequency of smaller than 0.01 in either case or
control group, 6,479 SNPs with lower success rates (,0.98) and 35
SNPs with distorted Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p,1027
) were
removed, resulting in 484,751 SNP markers being used for
analysis. Principal component analysis by EIGENSOFT [17]
including phase II HapMap (http://hapmap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)
samples identified no samples that were deviated from the
Japanese population. Subsequently, the degree of kinship between
individuals was examined by pi-hat in PLINK 1.07 (http://pngu.
mgh.harvard.edu/purcell/plink/) [23]. Of the eight pairs of
samples (four case pairs and four control pairs) showing high
degrees of kinship (PI-HAT.0.4), the sample with the lower call
rate in each pair was removed. After these steps, 529 case and 932
controls were used for the analysis.
Statistical Analysis
A case/control association analysis was performed by exact
trend test between NAFLD patients and control subjects [24]. The
correction of obtained p-values for population stratification was
performed using EIGENSTRAT [17]. In addition, an association
between Matteoni classification (type1 to type4) and additive
model of genotype for each SNP was examined using Jonckheere￾Terpstra test for NAFLD patients. Assessment of population
stratification of inflation of p-value was carried out by the genomic
control method for asymptotic trend test [25]. Association between
each quantitative trait and the genotype of significant SNPs in
NAFLD patients were calculated by multivariable linear regression
or multivariable ordinal regression adjusted for age, sex and BMI.
Each quantitative trait was transformed as follows; natural log for
ALT, AST, HOMA-IR, HbA1c, IRI, triglyceride, total bilirubin,
adiponectin, hs-CRP, hyaluronic acid, leptin, reciprocal number
for albumin, cholinesterase, type IV collagen 7S and square root
for uric acid and ferritin. The values of FPG, PLT, total
cholesterol, amount of visceral fat, and abdominal circumscript
were not transformed. For each trait, values that were within only
4 S.D. were included for analysis. LD indices were calculated by
default setting of Haploview [26] and the LD block was defined
manually.

Reference (A1) and non-reference (A2) alleles refer to NCBI Reference Sequence Build 36.3 with the effective allele marked by an asterisk. Genotyping results are shown
by genotype count of A1A1/A1A2/A2A2 with allele frequency of A2 in parenthesis. {P-values are calculated by exact trend test with odds ratios (OR) calculated for A2
with 95% confidence interval (CI). {P-values are calculated by Jonckheere-Terpstra test in NAFLD patients for Matteoni type and additive model of genotype.
