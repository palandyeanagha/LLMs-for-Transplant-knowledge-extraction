Epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by increased susceptibility to 
specific human papillomaviruses, the betapapillomaviruses. These EV-HPVs cause warts and increase the risk 
of skin carcinomas in otherwise healthy individuals. Inactivating mutations in epidermodysplasia verrucifor￾mis 1 (EVER1) or EVER2 have been identified in most, but not all, patients with autosomal recessive EV. We 
found that 2 young adult siblings presenting with T cell deficiency and various infectious diseases, includ￾ing persistent EV-HPV infections, were homozygous for a mutation creating a stop codon in the ras homo￾log gene family member H (RHOH) gene. RHOH encodes an atypical Rho GTPase expressed predominantly 
in hematopoietic cells. Patients’ circulating T cells contained predominantly effector memory T cells, which 
displayed impaired TCR signaling. Additionally, very few circulating T cells expressed the β7 integrin sub￾unit, which homes T cells to specific tissues. Similarly, Rhoh-null mice exhibited a severe overall T cell defect 
and abnormally small numbers of circulating β7-positive cells. Expression of the WT, but not of the mutated 
RHOH, allele in Rhoh–/– hematopoietic stem cells corrected the T cell lymphopenia in mice after bone marrow 
transplantation. We conclude that RHOH deficiency leads to T cell defects and persistent EV-HPV infections, 
suggesting that T cells play a role in the pathogenesis of chronic EV-HPV infections. 
Introduction
Epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV) is a rare, lifelong disorder 
characterized by disseminated and persistent flat warts or pityria￾sis versicolor–like (PV-like) lesions due to an abnormal and selective 
susceptibility to a specific group of weakly virulent related kerati￾nocyte-tropic human betapapillomavirus genotypes (EV-HPVs), 
including the oncogenic human PV type 5 (HPV-5) (OMIM 226400). 
EV is associated with an increase in the risk of non-melanoma 
skin carcinomas (NMSC) (1), with no other clinical signs in most 
patients (2). Cockayne et al. first suggested in 1933 that EV could 
be inherited as an autosomal recessive (AR) condition (3). However, 
EV was not considered as a primary immunodeficiency (PID) until 
the identification of inactivating mutations in epidermodysplasia 
verruciformis 1 (EVER1) (TMC6) and in EVER2 (TMC8) (4–8). Muta￾tions in these two genes account for approximately 75% of the stud￾ied cases (9–16). Both genes are expressed in circulating lympho￾cytes (refs. 15, 17) and keratinocytes, in which the EVER proteins 
form a complex with the zinc transporter ZnT1, which regulates 
intracellular zinc distribution and, consequently, controls the activ￾ity of zinc-dependent transcription factors and cell proliferation 
(18). We investigated 2 siblings, now aged 20 and 31 years, who were 
born to first-cousin parents and have displayed since childhood a 
phenotype related to but distinct from EV, with persistent EV-HPV 
infections and other clinical manifestations, including bronchopul￾monary disease and Burkitt lymphoma in one patient. Mutations 
in EVER1 and EVER2 have been excluded in these patients, and a 
putative disease-causing locus has been mapped to a broad region 
of chromosome 2p21–p24 by genome-wide linkage analysis (GWL) 
and homozygosity mapping with a few hundred polymorphic 
microsatellites (19). We further investigated the molecular genetic 
basis of the disease in this kindred by a GWL approach, this time 
using a high-density SNP map. This approach led to the identifica￾tion of additional linked regions and, finally, to the discovery of a 
disease-causing nonsense mutation in the ras homolog gene family 
member H (RHOH) gene on chromosome 4p13.

Results
Identification of a nonsense mutation in the RHOH gene. We investigated 
2 patients (P1 and P2) with persistent EV-HPV infections and 
other clinical manifestations (Supplemental Figure 1 and detailed 
case report in Methods; supplemental material available online 
with this article; doi:10.1172/JCI62949DS1) born to consanguin￾eous French parents (Figure 1A). We conducted a new GWL study 
in this family, by homozygosity mapping with a high-density 
SNP array (Supplemental Methods). Five regions, including the 
region originally identified on chromosome 2p21–p24 (19), dis￾tributed on 3 chromosomes, with an equal maximum lod score 
of 2.1, were identified in this analysis (Supplemental Figure 2, 
A–C). These 5 putative disease-associated regions contained 174 
protein-coding genes and 108 RNA genes (Supplemental Tables 
1–3 and data not shown). Whole-exome sequencing was carried 
out for both patients, covering 172 protein-coding genes in the 
linked regions with a mean of 81.8 and 98.7 reads per gene for 
P1 and P2, respectively. Only 2 protein-coding genes in the linked 
regions carried homozygous variants present in both patients 
and absent from public databases (Ensembl, National Center 
for Biotechnology Information, 1000 Genomes): FAM179A and 
RHOH. The best candidate variant was a homozygous nucleotide 
substitution (C>G) at position 114 in exon 3 of the RHOH gene, 
which is located on chromosome 4p13, resulting in the replace￾ment of a tyrosine residue with a stop codon (Y38X) (Figure 1B). 
The RHOH gene encodes an atypical, hematopoietic cell–specific 
member of the Rho GTPase family. Canonical Rho GTPases func￾tion as intracellular switches, transducing signals from various 
membrane receptors, including T and B cell receptors. Atypical 
Rho GTPases, including RHOH, lack GTPase activity and there￾fore remain in the active, GTP-bound conformation (20, 21). The 
premature termination codon, Y38X, is located upstream from 
sequences encoding 2 important functional protein domains of 
RHOH: the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif–like 
(ITAM-like) motif not found in any other Rho GTPases and the 
CAAX box, a lipid modification site common to all Rho GTPases

that mediates the localization of the protein to membranes (Figure 
1C and ref. 22). The other 2 siblings and the parents were healthy 
and heterozygous for the nonsense Y38X RHOH allele (Figure 1A). 
This allele was not found in any of the 1,050 healthy controls from 
51 ethnic groups investigated (Human Genome Diversity Proj￾ect–Centre d’Etude du Polymorphisme Humain [HGDP-CEPH] 
panel), suggesting that this is a rare pathogenic mutation rather 
than an irrelevant polymorphism. Moreover, RHOH has no known 
polymorphic nonsense or frameshift alleles present in public data￾bases. Somatic mutations in RHOH have previously been found in 
various B cell cancers, including Burkitt lymphoma (23–26). The 
established link between RHOH and B cell cancers therefore sug￾gests that homozygosity for Y38X may also have contributed to 
the development of Burkitt lymphoma in P1. Collectively, these 
data suggest that the Y38X RHOH allele is responsible for the 
disease in this kindred.
The Y38X RHOH allele results in a loss-of-function protein. RHOH
mRNA levels were normal, as shown by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT￾PCR) analysis of the patients’ herpesvirus saimiri–transformed 
T cell lines (saimiri T cells), which were compared with those of 
healthy controls and healthy members of the family (Figure 1D). 
RHOH protein levels were assessed by immunoblotting lysates 
of the patients’ saimiri T cells with an antibody recognizing an 
epitope upstream from the mutated residue. The 21-kDa RHOH 
protein was absent from the saimiri T cells of both patients, but 
was present in the cells of 2 healthy controls and 2 healthy family 
members heterozygous for the mutant allele (Figure 1E). Transla￾tion reinitiation is possible, as 4 different ATG start codons are 
located downstream from the mutation (Figure 1C) and such 
reinitiation has been documented for upstream nonsense muta￾tions in other genes (27). Thus, both a cDNA corresponding to the 
N-terminal HA-tagged Y38X RHOH sequence and an HA-tagged 
cDNA corresponding to the 145–amino acid C terminus that 
would be translated from the first downstream ATG at nucleo￾tide position 139 of the gene (139-C RHOH) were inserted into a 
retroviral vector. NIH/3T3 cells were transfected with these vec￾tors, together with an HA-tagged WT RHOH vector used as a posi￾tive control. No protein from Y38X RHOH–transfected cells was 
detected on immunoblots with an anti-HA antibody, whereas a 
protein smaller than WT-RHOH was detected on immunoblots 
of cells producing RhoH 139-C (Figure 1F). Thus, the possibility 
of translation reinitiation cannot be formally excluded. We pre￾viously showed that thymocyte selection is defective and T cell 
maturation is blocked at the DN3 and DP stages in Rhoh–/– mice, 
which consequently display profound T cell lymphopenia (28, 29). 
We directly assessed the function of the proteins encoded by the 
human Y38X RHOH and 139-C RHOH mutant genes in T cell res￾cue experiments in vivo by transducing bone marrow cells from 
Rhoh–/– mice with a retroviral vector containing the human Y38X 
RHOH mutant, the 139-C RHOH truncated cDNA, or the WT 
RHOH cDNA. The transduced cells were then transplanted into 
sublethally irradiated Rag2–/– recipient mice. Mice receiving bone 
marrow cells transduced with the Y38X RHOH or 139-C RHOH 
cDNA had no more T cells than mice receiving cells transduced 
with the empty vector 3 months after transplantation. In contrast, 
as previously reported, mice receiving cells transduced with WT 
RHOH cDNA had significantly larger numbers of T cells, resulting 
in the partial rescue of Rhoh–/– T cell lymphopenia (Figure 2A). The 
mutant Y38X RHOH allele is therefore loss of function.
Impact of human RHOH deficiency on T cells. Unlike EVER1 and 
EVER2, the RHOH gene is expressed only in hematopoietic cells, 
including myeloid cells, NK cells, B cells, and T cells (20, 30, 31). 
We carried out general immunophenotyping on whole-blood sam￾ples or cryopreserved PBMCs from the patients to assess the vari￾ous blood lineage subsets and on serum samples from the patients 
to assess their Ig levels. There were no major abnormalities in the 
Figure 2
The Y38X RHOH allele is loss of function in the mouse model and is associated with an impaired phosphorylation of ZAP70 upon TCR stimula￾tion in the patients’ saimiri T cells. (A) Bone marrow cells from Rhoh–/– mice (KO) of mixed background were transduced with an empty retroviral 
vector encoding YFP or a retroviral vector coexpressing the YFP gene and WT RHOH, Y38X RHOH, or 139-C RHOH genes and transplanted 
into sublethally irradiated Rag2–/– recipient mice. Normal bone marrow cells transduced with an empty vector were included as a control. The 
percentage of CD3+ cells within the YFP+-transduced T cell group was assessed in the blood of recipient mice 3 months after transplantation by 
flow cytometry (mean ± SEM, n = 4 recipients per construct). *P < 0.05; **P < 0.005. (B) Representative immunoblots of cell lysates extracted from 
saimiri T cells of a healthy control and the 2 patients (P1 and P2) following OKT3 stimulation, probed with anti-ZAP70 and anti–phospho-ZAP70

sorted saimiri T cells (control and patient P2) transduced with a vector encoding YFP and the HA-tagged mutant Y38X RHOH (HA-Y38X), YFP 
and the HA-tagged WT RHOH (HA-WT), or YFP alone (MOCK), subsequently stimulated with OKT3. Lysates were blotted with anti-ZAP70 and 
anti-phospho-ZAP70 antibodies. β-Actin was used as an additional protein-loading control.

frequencies of B cell subsets, NK cells, NKT cells (Supplemental 
Figure 3 and Supplemental Table 4), monocytes and polymor￾phonuclear cells (Supplemental Table 4), and in antibody pro￾duction (Supplemental Table 6). The patients’ total T cell counts 
fell within the normal range. However, both patients had slightly 
lower frequencies of CD4+ T cells than normal, but higher frequen￾cies of CD8+ T cells and normal frequencies of γδ T cells (Table 1 
and Supplemental Tables 4 and 5). We then investigated the vari￾ous naive and memory subsets of the patients’ T cells at different 
ages (Table 1, Supplemental Table 5, and Supplemental Figure 4). 
Percentages of naive CD4+CD45RA+, CD4+CCR7+CD45RA+, and 
CD8+CCR7+CD45RA+ cells and of recent thymic T cell emigrants 
CD4+CD31+CD45RA+ were consistently very low in both patients. 
Central memory CD4+CCR7+CD45RA– and CD8+CCR7+CD45RA–
cells were reduced to a lesser extent. However, memory 
CD4+CD45RO+, effector memory (TEM) CD4+CD45RA–CCR7– and 
CD8+CCR7–CD45RA– and revertant memory (TEMRA) CD8+CCR7–
CD45RA+ T cell percentages were above the upper limit of the 
normal range. An immunoscope analysis of the TCR Vαβ and Vγδ
repertoires showed a loss of the normal Gaussian-like polyclonal 
distribution for the Vα8b, Vα10, Vβ28, Vβ13, Vγ9, and Vδ1 fami￾lies (Supplemental Figure 5). This suggested restricted TCR usage 
and the clonal expansion of certain families, consistent with the 
expansion of the effector memory T cell compartment in the 
patients. Interestingly, the expanded memory cell populations in 
both the CD4+ and CD8+ compartments showed signs of exhaus￾tion, with the upregulation of 2B4, CX3CR1, CD57, granzyme B, 
and perforin and the downregulation of CD127, CD27, and 
CD62L with respect to healthy controls (Supplemental Figure 6), 
with some variability of statistical significance between markers 
and subsets. This exhaustion phenotype and the expansion of 
memory T cell subsets were previously observed in other cases of 
chronic infection, including for patients with PIDs (32, 33), sug￾gesting that the increase of memory T cells and their exhaustion 
phenotype are more likely to be consequences of chronic infection 
rather than causes of the disease. Thus, RHOH deficiency is associ￾ated with a lack of naive T cells in the patients’ peripheral blood, 
suggesting a developmental defect consistent with the defect in 
thymic T cell development observed in Rhoh–/– mice (28).
Defective TCR signaling in the patients’ T cells. We then assessed 
the impact of RHOH deficiency on the function of the patients’ 
T cells. PBMCs were isolated from the patients at different ages 
and stimulated with phytohemagglutinin (PHA), an anti-CD3 
antibody (OKT3), OKT3 plus anti-CD28 Ab, PMA/ionomycin, or 
recall antigens (tetanus toxoid, tuberculin, candidin). Their pro￾liferation was assessed by evaluating the incorporation of tritiated 
thymidine (Table 1, Supplemental Table 5, and data not shown). 
The T cells of both patients responded to various recall antigens 
in terms of proliferation, with some antigens eliciting weaker 
responses than others. In contrast, they failed to proliferate in 
response to various doses of OKT3, but proliferated in response 
to OKT3 plus anti-CD28 Ab, PHA, or PMA/ionomycin, although 
proliferation rates remained below the normal range (Table 1 and 
Supplemental Table 5). Consistent with the known role of RHOH 
in TCR signaling (28, 29, 34, 35), these data suggest abnormali￾ties in TCR-mediated activation that are partially compensated 
by PMA/ionomycin for the stimulation of cells downstream from 
RHOH or PHA for the stimulation of other membrane-bound 
receptors, such as CD2 (36). As murine Rhoh–/– T cells have a defect 
in the localization of ZAP70 to the plasma membrane and its 
activation upon CD3 stimulation (refs. 28, 29, and Supplemental 
Table 7), we investigated ZAP70 phosphorylation in response to 
CD3 stimulation in saimiri T cells from the patients and a healthy 
control. Basal level of ZAP70 phosphorylation was high in the 
control cell line and was further increased by CD3 stimulation. In 
contrast, little or no ZAP70 phosphorylation was observed in the 
presence or absence of CD3 stimulation in the cells of P1 and P2, 
confirming the defective TCR signaling pathway observed ex vivo 
(Figure 2B). We investigated whether the impairment of ZAP70 
activation was due to a loss of RHOH function in the patients’ 
saimiri T cells by transfecting cells from P2 with an empty retro￾viral control vector (MOCK) or a WT RHOH–expressing retroviral 
vector and then stimulating the transfected cells with OKT3. In 
parallel, saimiri T cells from a healthy donor were transduced with 
an empty vector (MOCK) or a vector expressing the mutant Y38X 
RHOH allele as controls. Patients’ cells transduced with WT RHOH
had higher levels of residual and OKT3-induced ZAP70 phosphory￾lation than MOCK-transduced cells (Figure 2C), demonstrating the 
association of the RHOH mutation with the observed phenotype.
Alterations in tissue-homing T cell subsets in the patients. The occur￾rence of persistent EV-HPV infections in both patients suggested a 
focal defect in the immune system. We thus hypothesized that the 
development of some skin-homing T cells might be affected by the 
loss of RHOH. The most specific skin-homing markers of human 
T cells are the cutaneous lymphocyte antigen (CLA) and the che￾mokine receptors CCR4, CCR6, and CCR10 (37). We assessed

the different tissue-homing subsets expressing these markers as 
percentages of CD3+ cells and counts per million PBMCs (Fig￾ure 3, A–C, Supplemental Figure 7, A, B, D, E, and Supplemental 
Figure 8). We also evaluated the CLA+ subset in the various naive 
and memory compartments of the CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets 
(Supplemental Figure 9, A and B). The CD4+CLA+ and CD8+CLA+
T cell subsets in the patients’ PBMCs appeared to be smaller than 
normal. Surprisingly, the CD4+ and 
CD8+ populations had a much higher 
proportion of CLA+ naive T cells and 
a lower proportion of CLA+ central 
and effector memory T cells than for 
healthy controls. The CD3+CCR6+ and 
CD3+CCR10+ populations and the 
CD3+CLA+CCR4+, CD3+CLA+CCR6+, 
and CD3+CLA+CCR10+ subsets were 
also smaller than those in healthy 
controls. The decrease in the size of 
the subsets expressing only CLA or 
both CLA and one of the chemokine 
receptors was slightly less pronounced 
in the CD8+ subset than in the CD4+
subset. Integrins are also involved in 
tissue-homing of T lymphocytes (21). 
The αEβ7 integrin has been associ￾ated with lung, gut, and skin homing, 
whereas the α4β7 integrin has been 
associated with gut homing (21). Skin￾homing αE+β7
+ T cells also express 
CLA (38). We therefore investigated 
the expression of the αEβ7 integrin in 
the whole CD3+ T cell compartment, 
in the CD3+CLA+ T cell compartment 
(Figure 3D, Supplemental Figure 7, 
C and F, and Supplemental Figure 
8D), and in the various naive and 
memory T cell compartments of the 
patients’ PBMCs (Supplemental Fig￾ure 9, C and D). Within the CD3+ T 
cell population, the proportions and 
numbers of αE
+β7
+ and CLA+αE
+ cells 
were normal. Nevertheless, as previ￾ously observed for the CLA marker, 
naive αE
+ cells were more abundant, 
whereas effector memory αE+ cells 
were slightly less abundant than in 
healthy controls. We next assessed 
β7
+, α4
+, α4
+β7
+, and α4
+β7
– cells in the 
patients’ PBMCs (Figure 3E, Supple￾mental Figure 7, G–J, and Supple￾mental Figure 8E). Surprisingly, the 
β7
+ and α4
+β7
+ subsets were extremely 
small, whereas the α4
+ and α4+β7
–
subsets were significantly larger than 
normal in the CD3+, CD3+CD4+, and 
CD3+CD8+ compartments of the 
patients’ PBMCs, with some variabil￾ity of statistical significance between 
markers and subsets. In Rhoh–/– mice, 
the proportions of β7
+ and α4
+ T cells 
were also affected, with lower and higher than normal percentages 
of β7
+CD3+ and α4
+CD3+ T lymphocytes, respectively (Figure 3F). 
However, in contrast to our findings for patients, the decrease in 
the size of the β7
+ cell population was this time correlated with a 
decrease in the abundance of αE
+β7
+ cells, but not in that of α4
+β7
+
cells. As the Rhoh–/– mice were not infected with papillomaviruses, 
these data strongly suggest that the decrease in size of the β7
+ T cell

Human and mouse RHOH deficiencies lead to an abnormal integrin expression pattern. (A–E) Tis￾sue-homing T cell subsets were assessed on live CD3+-, CD3+CD4+-, and CD3+CD8+-gated cryopre￾served PBMCs from the 2 patients (P1 values indicated by gray squares, P2 values indicated by gray 
diamonds) and healthy controls (indicated by black circles) by flow cytometry. (A) Skin-homing CLA+

population in the patients was a consequence of RHOH deficiency 
rather than of persistent EV-HPV infection or other phenotypes.
Discussion
We report here the discovery of human RHOH deficiency in a 
kindred with a T cell deficiency and various infectious diseases, 
including persistent cutaneous lesions caused by EV-HPVs. Unlike 
EVER1 and EVER2, RHOH is not detectable in keratinocytes, 
which serve as the first line of defense against EV-HPVs. Moreover, 
although RHOH is normally expressed in all leukocytes, the T cell 
phenotype is clearly the strongest phenotype in mice and humans 
lacking RHOH. Rhoh–/– mice have a mild myeloid phenotype (39, 
40); no overt myeloid phenotype was observed in our patients. 
Moreover, none of the known patients with myeloid PIDs, includ￾ing disorders affecting mononuclear or polymorphonuclear 
phagocytes, display persistent EV-HPV infections (41, 42). Finally, 
a role for human T cells in immunity to cutaneous HPVs has 
been inferred from histological studies of regressing warts (43). 
The persistent lesions caused by EV-HPVs in patients with RHOH 
deficiency are therefore probably associated with the T cell defect. 
This may not be sufficient, as the contribution of additional fac￾tors may account for the expression of the whole EV-HPV genome 
in keratinocytes. In any case, the patients’ T cell phenotype is 
complex. The patients present a profound peripheral naive T cell 
lymphopenia, from at least the age of 26 years for P1 and 15 years 
for P2, probably due to a developmental defect. The total T cell 
counts of these patients are, however, normal, due to an increase 
in memory T cells with an exhaustion phenotype that probably 
results from chronic viral infection. The patients’ T cells also dis￾play an impaired TCR signaling pathway. In the spleen and lymph 
nodes of Rhoh–/– mice, the frequency of naive T cells is low, whereas 
that of memory T cells is high (34, 44). In addition, Rhoh-deficient 
splenocytes and thymocytes show an impaired response to CD3 
stimulation (Supplemental Table 7 and refs. 28, 34). RHOH thus 
seems to play a crucial role following TCR stimulation in both 
humans and mice.
RHOH deficiency has several immunological features in com￾mon with the combined immunodeficiencies (CIDs) involving 
deficiencies of CD3γ, ZAP70, ITK, STIM1, ORAI1, MAGT1, MST1, 
and DOCK8 (45–47), in which naive T cells are lost from the CD4+
or CD8+ compartment or both, and the response of peripheral 
T cells to anti-CD3 mAb stimulation is impaired (Supplemental 
Table 8). DOCK8 and MST1 deficiencies are also associated with 
an expansion of the memory cell population with an exhaustion 
phenotype. However, the immunological and clinical phenotype of 
the 2 RHOH-deficient patients seems to be less severe than that of 
patients with these CIDs. Indeed, neither of our patients displays 
any signs of autoimmunity, and they have a narrower susceptibility 
to infection than the other patients, despite the bronchopulmo￾nary disease and Burkitt lymphoma observed in P1. These RHOH￾deficient patients nonetheless suffer from persistent EV-HPV 
infections. DOCK8- and most MST1-deficient patients suffer from 
recurrent cutaneous viral infections, including α-HPV infections, 
but not from persistent EV-HPV infections (47, 48). Interestingly, 
we recently found an MST1-deficient patient with persistent EV￾HPV infections (A. Crequer, unpublished observations). Neverthe￾less, the majority of CID patients have never displayed persistent 
EV-HPV infections. This is unlikely to reflect an ascertainment bias, 
as the first lesions appeared at the ages of 7 and 4 years in P1 and 
P2, respectively, whereas patients with other T cell defects did not 
display EV-HPV–infected lesions at this age. Moreover, EV-HPVs 
are ubiquitous, and both patients with RHOH deficiency suffer 
from susceptibility to these viruses. Thus, impaired TCR signal￾ing and a lack of naive T cells, as seen in patients with other T cell 
defects, may not be sufficient to confer susceptibility to EV-HPVs.
RHOH-deficient patients’ T cells also have an altered expression 
of tissue-homing markers. The most striking differences between 
the patients and healthy controls were observed in the β7
+ and α4
+
subsets, which were significantly smaller and larger in the patients’ 
PBMCs, respectively. Indeed, the patients had very low counts 
and frequencies of a specific tissue-homing α4
+β7
+ T cell subset, 
despite having a larger than normal α4
+ subset, and this may be 
relevant to this particular issue. It is known that the α4 chain can 
be associated with either the β7 subunit or the β1 subunit (21). 
The increased size of the α4
+β7
– T cell subset therefore reflects an 
increase of T cells expressing the α4
+β1
+ integrin, which is known 
to be strongly expressed on memory cells (49). This increase may 
therefore be correlated with the excess of memory T cells in the 
patients’ peripheral blood. The α4
+β7
+ T cell subset has been shown 
to home to the gut, although no significant disorder affecting the 
gut was observed in our patients (50, 51). However, this subset 
has also been associated with cutaneous homing in situations of 
immune dysregulation, such as contact hypersensitivity and spon￾giotic dermatitis (52, 53). Interestingly, Rhoh–/– mice also have a low 
frequency of β7
+ T cells among CD3+ T cells and a high frequency 
of α4
+ T cells (Supplemental Table 7). As Rhoh–/– mice were not 
challenged with cutaneous EV-HPVs or any other pathogens, their 
integrin phenotype is unlikely to result from chronic infections. 
The abnormal integrin profiles of the patients’ T cells are there￾fore unlikely to be a consequence of persistent EV-HPV infections. 
Based on the T cell phenotype common to both RHOH-deficient 
mice and humans, the pathogenesis of susceptibility to EV-HPVs 
might involve a combination of the various T cell phenotypes doc￾umented, including impaired T cell responses, a lack of naive cells, 
and a smaller than normal proportion of β7+ T cells.
Regardless of the detailed mechanism involved, which remains 
elusive, these data suggest that T cells may play an important 
role in protective immunity to skin-tropic EV-HPVs, at least in 
some individuals. In the literature, there are currently 2 hypoth￾eses, not mutually exclusive, to explain the pathogenesis of EV in 
EVER deficiency: EVER deficiency alleviates the inhibition of the 
expression of the whole genome of EV-HPVs in keratinocytes, and 
EVER deficiency impairs T cell immunity against EV-HPVs (15, 
54). The hypothesis of a keratinocyte contribution to EV in these 
patients is supported by the appearance of EV lesions on the skin 
of JAK3- and IL2-Rγ–deficient patients after bone marrow trans￾plantation, particularly in cases of successful T cell engraftment 
(55). Nevertheless, the EVER proteins are also expressed in T cells, 
and some EV patients seem to have poor cell-mediated immunity 
(15). Unfortunately, the impact of EVER1 and EVER2 deficiencies 
has not yet been investigated in T cells. We report here the associa￾tion of RHOH deficiency with a profound T cell deficiency and 
persistent EV-HPV infections. The EVER proteins may regulate 
zinc distribution in T cells, as suggested by Lazarczyk et al. (54). 
Zinc has been shown to contribute to T cell receptor signaling 
by increasing ZAP70 phosphorylation (56). It would therefore be 
interesting to assess T cell function and tissue-homing subsets in 
EVER-deficient patients to test the hypothesis that T cell immu￾nity is also impaired in patients with EVER deficiency. Conversely, 
the 2 RHOH-deficient patients may also have elusive keratino-

cyte abnormalities favoring the development of EV-HPV lesions, 
which might not solely result from a T cell deficiency. The search 
for new genetic disorders underlying EV and EV-HPV persistent 
infections at large will help to clarify the contribution of kerati￾nocytes and T lymphocytes to the pathogenesis of persistent EV￾HPV infections in humans.
Methods
Case report: RHOH-deficient patients P1 and P2. P1 and P2 are French and were 
born to married first cousins. The pedigree is shown in Figure 1A. P1 was 
born in 1980. At the age of 5 years, he was diagnosed with Burkitt lym￾phoma of the abdominal lymph nodes and was treated by chemotherapy 
and with systemic steroids. At the age of 7 years, disseminated flat wart￾like lesions began to appear on his face and on the back of his hands after 
chemotherapy. In addition, many common warts and several psoriatic-like 
lesions developed on his arms, forearms, hands, and cheeks. These lesions 
were persistent in spite of treatment with retinoic acid, cimetidin, and 
imiquimod, which was relatively effective against the warts. Eruptions of 
rosacea when the patient reached the ages of 11 and 12 were treated with 
local metronidazole. HPV genotypes 3, 12, and 20 were identified in DNA 
preparations obtained from scrapings or biopsy specimens from flat wart￾like lesions both by Southern blot hybridization and by the sequencing of 
amplicons obtained in a nested PCR, as previously described (19). At the age 
of 7 years, a granulomatous structure was detected in the upper left lung 
lobe and removed. P1 suffered from emphysema and right pneumothorax 
at the ages of 11 and 15 years. Attempts to control his chronic bronchial 
disease included intravenous IgG (polyvalent IVIG) substitution and oral 
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (cotrimoxazole). P2 was born in 1990. At 
the age of 4 years, a few psoriatic lesions and flat warts appeared on her 
scalp and her forehead, respectively. At the age of 9 years, disseminated flat 
wart-like lesions spread on her face, her neck, and the back of her hands, a 
papilloma lesion appeared on 1 eyelid, and molluscum lesions appeared on 
her neck and under her arms. At the age of 14 years, a few PV-like lesions 
appeared on P2’s chest. All these lesions were treated with imiquimod, to 
which the flat warts were resistant. P2 also had gingivostomatitis at the age 
of 2 years. HPV 20 was detected in sections of formaldehyde-fixed, paraffin￾embedded flat wart-like lesions. The histological features of the flat-wart￾like lesions of both patients are shown in Supplemental Figure 1. Blood 
samples were collected from 7 individuals of the kindred.
Whole-exome sequencing. Whole-exome sequencing was carried out as pre￾viously described, with the Agilent SureSelect Human All Exon 50 Mb Kit 
(Agilent Technologies) for exome capture. Paired-end sequencing gener￾ated 100-base reads, sequences were aligned with the hg19 build of the 
human genome, and all calls with a read coverage of less than 2× and a 
phred-scaled SNP quality of less than 20 were filtered out (57).
Immunoblot analysis. Immunoblot analysis was carried out as previously 
described (23). We separated 30 μg of whole saimiri T cell lysates by 12% SDS￾PAGE and then analyzed the protein bands obtained by immunoblotting.
TCR stimulation and rescue experiments in saimiri T cells. Saimiri T cells 
(1 × 106) were deprived of IL-2 for 3 hours and then stimulated by incuba￾tion for 2 minutes with 100 ng/ml monoclonal anti-CD3 antibody OKT3 
and crosslinking anti-mouse IgG antibody. The cells were then collected 
by centrifugation and the cell pellets were immediately frozen at –80°C. 
For subsequent immunoblot analysis, anti–phospho-ZAP70 (Cell Sig￾naling Technology) and anti-ZAP70 (Upstate) antibodies were used at a 
dilution of 1:1,000. For in vitro rescue experiments, the patients’ saimiri 
T cells were then transduced with retroviral vectors coexpressing YFP and 
HA–WT RHOH. As a control, the patients’ saimiri T cells were transduced 
with a YFP-expressing retroviral vector, and healthy saimiri cells were trans￾duced with either a YFP-expressing retroviral vector or a retroviral vector 
coexpressing YFP and HA–Y38X RHOH. YFP+ cells were sorted and used 
for biochemical analysis. An aliquot of sorted cells was stimulated with 
anti-CD3 OKT3 antibody, as described above, and immunoblot analysis 
of phospho- and total ZAP70 was again performed. β-Actin was used as 
an additional loading control. The production of HA-tagged WT RHOH 
protein in transduced cells was further confirmed by immunoblotting with 
an anti-HA antibody (data not shown).
Generation of Rhoh-deficient mice. The generation of Rhoh–/– mice has been 
described elsewhere (28). 
Mouse bone marrow cell transduction and transplantation. Mouse bone mar￾row cells were transduced with retroviruses, as previously described (28). 
Briefly, the HA-tagged mutant Y38X RHOH cDNA and the HA-tagged 
cDNA encoding a truncated RHOH protein translated from the down￾stream ATG (RHOH–139-C), corresponding to the 145 amino acids at 
the C terminus, were inserted into mouse stem cell virus–based retrovi￾ral vectors coexpressing YFP, as previously described for WT RHOH (28). 
Lin–Sca1+ckit+ (LSK) bone marrow cells from Rhoh–/– mice of mixed genetic 
background were sorted, stimulated, and infected on fibronectin-coated 
plates (CH-296; Takara Bio), with a high-titer retrovirus supernatant gener￾ated in Phoenix-gp cells. Two days after transduction, YFP+ cells were sorted 
and transplanted, by intravenous injection, into sublethally irradiated 
(3 Gy with a 137Cs irradiator) Rag2–/– recipient mice. Three months after 
transplantation, white blood cell counts were obtained and the percentage 
of YFP+ T cells in the peripheral blood of the animals was determined by 
flow cytometry. The expression of HA-WT RHOH and HA-RHOH 139-C 
and the lack of detectable protein encoded by the HA–Y38X RHOH retro￾virus was confirmed by immunoblot analysis.
Flow cytometry experiments. Murine blood samples were obtained 3 months 
after transplantation by retroorbital puncture. Before staining, red blood 
cells were lysed by incubation in BD Pharm Lyse (BD Biosciences) for 10 
minutes at room temperature. Cell suspensions were then incubated with 
the appropriate antibodies for 30 minutes in the dark at 4°C. DAPI staining 
was carried out to exclude dead cells. Cells were subsequently washed, resus￾pended in PBS supplemented with 2% FCS, and analyzed with an LSRII 
cytometer and FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences). Blood samples from 
the patients and healthy controls were collected into EDTA and stained 
by incubation for 20 minutes with antibodies in 1% BSA in PBS in the 
dark at 4°C. Red blood cells were then lysed in FACS lysis solution (0.01 M 
NaHCO3, 1 mM EDTA, 0.14 M NH4Cl) in 3 successive cycles of incubation 
for 5 minutes at room temperature in the dark. Samples were washed in 
1× PBS (Gibco; Invitrogen) and resuspended in 4% paraformaldehyde in 
PBS for analysis on a BD FACScanto machine (BD Biosciences). Cryopre￾served PBMCs were blocked by incubation for 15 minutes at 4°C with FcR￾blocking reagent (MACS) in 0.5 mM EDTA, 1% BSA in PBS, and washed 
in 1× PBS and subsequently stained by incubation for 30 minutes at 4°C 
with the various antibodies against tissue-homing markers and the Aqua 
Live/Dead Marker (Invitrogen). Cells were then washed twice in 1× PBS 
and resuspended in 100 μl of fixing solution (2% formaldehyde in 1× PBS). 
Samples were then analyzed on an LSRII machine (BD). Invitrogen mouse 
beads were used for compensation. At least 10 age-matched healthy controls 
were tested in addition to the patients for each marker.
Thymidine incorporation assay. PBMCs were incubated for 3 days alone or 
with PHA (2.5 μg/ml), the monoclonal soluble anti-CD3 antibody OKT3 
(10, 25, 50 ng/ml), or PMA (10–7 or 10–8 M) plus ionomycin (10–5 or 10–6 M) 
or for 6 days with tetanus toxoid (0.2–0.4 μg/ml), HSV, tuberculin (5 μg/
ml), or candidin (50 μg/ml). Cultures were pulsed with tritiated thymidine 
for the last 18 hours of the incubation period. The radioactivity incorpo￾rated was determined with a Matrix 96 beta counter (Canberra Packard). 
Cell proliferation was assessed by determining the cpm for [3H] thymidine 
incorporation, as previously described (58, 59).

Statistics. Two-tailed Student’s t tests were used to compare (a) the per￾centages of CD3+ cells within the YFP+ reconstituted cell population 
between the various groups of mice into which cells were transplanted, (b) 
the percentages of the various naive and memory subsets and counts for 
the various tissue-homing T cell subsets between patients and healthy con￾trols, and (c) the percentages of the various tissue-homing T cell subsets 
in WT and Rhoh–/– mice. Differences were considered significant if P values 
were less than 0.05 for all comparisons.
Study approval. Written informed consent was obtained from all family 
members. All human experiments were approved by the IRB of Necker 
Hospital for Sick Children and the IRB of Rockefeller University. All ani￾mal procedures and experiments were approved by the Institutional Ani￾mal Care and Use Committee of Children’s Hospital Boston.
