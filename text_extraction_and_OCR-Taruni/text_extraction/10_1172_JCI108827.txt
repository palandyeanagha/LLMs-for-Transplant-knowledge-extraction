normal humans inhibited acute insulin responses to a
glucose (5 g i.v.) pulse (response before PGE2 = 593
+ 104%; during PGE2 = 312+55%, mean+SE, mean
change 3-5 min insulin, % basal, P < 0.005). This
effect was associated with a decrease in glucose dis￾appearance rates (KG before PGE2= 0.73+0.07;
during PGE2= 0.49+0.06 %/min, P < 0.025). Acute
insulin responses to arginine (2 g i.v.) were not
affected by PGE2 (response before PGE2 = 592+164%;
during PGE2 = 590+118%; P = NS). Infusion of
sodium salicylate (SS), an inhibitor of endogenous pros￾taglandin synthesis, augmented acute insulin re￾sponses to glucose in normals (response before SS

adult-onset diabetes with fasting hyperglycemia, SS
restored absent acute insulin responses to glucose
(20 g i.v.) pulses (response before SS = 5+6%; during
SS = 97+24%; P < 0.005). This was accompanied by
a fourfold augmentation in second phase insulin

PGE synthesis may play a role in defective insulin
secretion and glucose intolerance in diabetes mellitus.
INTRODUCTION
Adult-onset diabetic patients with fasting hyper￾glycemia lack acute insulin responses (first phase
insulin secretion) to glucose (1). This abnormality
in pancreatic B-cell function appears to be related
specifically to glucose since acute insulin responses
are present to a variety of other secretogogues,
such as isoproterenol, amino acids, secretin, and
glucagon (2-5). Elucidation of the underlying mecha￾nism which causes defective acute insulin responses
is important not only because this response is con￾sistently absent in adult-onset diabetes mellitus, but
also because the acute response is normally a major
determinant of intravenous glucose tolerance (6).
Lack of acute responses to glucose stimulation could
be due to a defect within ,the pancreatic B cell or
suppression of its normal function by endogenous fac￾tors. Consequently, considerable interest has de￾veloped in endogenous substances that can inhibit
acute insulin responses. The only endogenous sub￾stances which have been demonstrated to be inhibi￾tory in normal humans are catecholamines and somato￾statin (7-10). We have previously reported that pros￾taglandins of the E series inhibit glucose-induced
secretion in vivo in dogs (11, 12). Unlike catechola￾mines and somatostatin, however, inhibition by pros￾taglandin E of insulin secretion is not reversed by
a-adrenergic blockade (11, 13). Since there have been
no reported investigations concerning the effects
of prostaglandins upon acute insulin responses in
humans, this investigation was designed to answer
two questions. (a) What are the effects of prostaglandin
E upon acute insulin responses and glucose tolerance
in normal humans? (b) What are the effects of inhibi￾tion of endogenous prostaglandin E synthesis in normal
and in diabetic humans upon insulin secretion and glu￾The Journal of Clinical Investigation Volume 60 September 1977-747-753 747

cose tolerance? To answer these questions, we have
examined (a) the effect of intravenous prostaglandin E2
infusions in normal volunteers upon basal levels of
insulin and glucose, and their responses to intravenous
glucose or arginine stimulation; and (b) the effect of
an infusion of an inhibitor of endogenous pros￾taglandin synthesis, sodium salicylate (14), in normal
volunteers and in adult-onset hyperglycemic diabetics
upon basal levels of insulin and glucose and their re￾sponses to intravenous glucose stimulation.
METHODS
The normal volunteers had no personal or family history
of diabetes mellitus. The diabetic subjects were neither
ketotic nor insulin dependent and none had received oral
hypoglycemic agents for at least 5 days before the experi￾ments. All studies were conducted after a 12 h fast and at
bed rest between the hours of 8 a.m. and 1 p.m. Intra￾venous 0.85% sodium chloride infusions were begun in
both arms 30 min before administration of the various test
agents. All blood samples were drawn through three-way
stopcocks to avoid additional venipunctures during the
infusions.
Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)' (10 ,ug/min) or sodium salicylate
(40 mg/min) were infused intravenously. This PGE2 infu￾sion rate was chosen because it is the maximal rate possible
that does not produce symptoms or blood pressure changes.
Glucose stimulation was provided by injecting intravenously
5 g of glucose in less than 3 s or 20 g of glucose in less
than 20 s. The smaller dose of glucose was used to deter￾mine whether sodium salicylate could augment the insulin
response in normals to this submaximal stimulus. The larger
dose of glucose, which causes maximal acute insulin re￾sponse in normals, was used to determine whether salicylate
could restore absent insulin responses in diabetic pa￾tients. Arginine stimulation was provided by injecting intra￾venously the half-maximal dose of 2 g in less than 5 s. Blood
samples were drawn at -15, -10, -5, and 0 min before the
beginning of each study. Additional samples were drawn
at 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 min after
the intravenous pulses had been given. The 90- and 120-
min samples were omitted after the 5-g glucose pulse.
Basal insulin levels were calculated as the mean of the four
samples drawn before the first pulse. The acute insulin
response (mean 3-5 min change insulin, % basal) was
calculated as the mean of the 3-, 4-, and 5-min post-glu￾cose injection values for a given subject from which was sub￾tracted the insulin level immediately before the pulse for
that subject; this number was then expressed as a percentage
of the basal value. Second phase insulin secretion was
calculated as the insulin area from 10 to 60 min after the
20-g pulse which was above the insulin level immediately
before the pulse. This area was expressed as a percentage of
the basal insulin level. Glucose disappearance rates
(KG) were calculated as the slope of the regression line
describing the inverse relationship between sampling
times (10 to 30 min) and the natural logarithm of plasma
glucose concentration and were expressed as percent per
minute. After collection in EDTA, blood samples for glu￾cose and insulin were kept at 40C until the end of the study
and then centrifuged at 2,500 rpm and 4°C. The plasma was
frozen for future analysis for glucose by an AutoAnalyzer￾ferricyanide method (15) and for insulin by a modification
of the method of Morgan and Lazarow (16). Additional
samples of blood were allowed to clot and the serum was
measured for salicylate levels (17). Statistical compari￾sons were performed by Student's t, paired t, and Wilcoxon
rank-sum tests.
RESULTS
The effect of PGE2 infusions in normal subjects
upon basal levels of insulin and glucose and their
responses to intravenous glucose or arginine pulses.
All normal subjects had fasting plasma glucose levels
less than 112 mgldl. All subjects had acute insulin
responses after 5 g of intravenous glucose (Fig. 1);
base-line levels were reestablished by 60 min after
the pulse. During the first 30 min of a subsequent
PGE2 infusion, there was no change in the mean in￾sulin level. After the second glucose pulse, an acute
insulin response was observed; however, this re￾sponse was significantly less than the response to the
first glucose pulse (first response = 593+104%;

was significantly greater than the response to a glu￾cose pulse before the infusion (Fig. 4; first response
= 313+62%; second response = 660+86%; n = 6,
P < 0.001). Compared to preinfusion levels, sodium

Compared to preinfusion levels, sodium salicylate
infusion itself caused an increase in circulating in￾sulin (preinfusion level = 125+7; 60-min level
= 231±21 % basal, P < 0.001). The control patients
receiving saline rather than sodium salicylate infu￾sion (Table II) had a mean fasting plasma glucose
level of 231±29 mg/dl which was not significantly
different from the group receiving sodium salicylate.
This group also failed to have an acute insulin
response after the first glucose pulse (Fig. 5; re￾sponse = -13+7%, n = 6, P = NS). In contrast to the
patients receiving sodium salicylate, however, this
group did not have acute insulin responses to the
second glucose pulse (response= 11±10%, P= NS).
No augmentation of second phase insulin secretion
was observed (second phase after first pulse= 1,137
+ 562%; after second pulse = 1,950+915%; P = NS).
Moreover, there was no increase in circulating insulin
during infusion of saline (preinfusion level = 127
+15; 60-min level = 92±19 % basal, P = NS). There
was a significant increase in the mean glucose disap￾pearance rate in the diabetic group receiving salicy￾late infusion (first pulse KG = 0.56+0.05; second pulse
KG= 1.02+0.17 %/min, P <0.005). There was no
change in KG in the group receiving saline rather than
salicylate infusion (first pulse KG = 0.65+0.08; second
pulse KG= 0.72±0.09; P = NS). The normal and dia￾betic groups had similar serum salicylate levels dur￾ing the salicylate infusion (60-min level: normal
= 20+5; diabetics = 23+6; 90 min level: normal = 27
±3; diabetics = 27+7 mg/dl, P= NS).
DISCUSSION
These data demonstrate that intravenous PGE2 infusion
inhibits the acute insulin response to glucose in
normal subjects. This inhibition was accompanied
by a decrease in glucose removal rates, suggesting
that the reduction in insulin release was biologically
significant. Neither inhibition of acute insulin re￾sponses nor deterioration of glucose disposal was ob￾served in the control group receiving saline rather than
PGE2. Acute insulin responses to arginine stimulation
were not inhibited by PGE2 which suggests that in￾hibition of the responses to glucose may represent
specific inhibition of glucose-related secretion by
PGE2 rather than nonspecific damping of islet secre￾tory mechanisms.
Infusion of sodium salicylate to inhibit endogenous
prostaglandin synthesis augmented glucose-induced
acute insulin responses in normal subjects. More strik￾ingly, salicylate restored acute insulin responses in 10
of 12 diabetics who had no response before salicylate

infusion. In 12 of 12 diabetics, there was on the
average a fourfold increase in second phase insulin
secretion. The salicylate infusion itself caused a signif￾icant rise in circulating insulin before the glucose
pulse. Glucose levels at this time in both normal
and diabetic patients were not rising. None of these
effects were observed in the control studies when
saline rather than salicylate was infused in the normal
and diabetic groups.
Glucose disappearance rates decreased during PGE2
infusion in normals. There was significant acceleration
of these rates in diabetics receiving salicylate in￾ftision. Four of the diabetics reached rates which
were within the normal range (>1.0%/min). No changes
in rates were observed in the normal and diabetic
control groups receiving saline rather than salicylate in￾ftisions. The fact that the mean increase in rate was
not statistically significant in the normal group receiv￾ing salicylate may indicate that a maximal rate for a

Prostaglandin E and Instulin Secretion in Diabetes Mellitus 751

terioration of glucose disposal caused by PGE2 infusion
is in agreement with previous in vivo nonhuman
investigation (11-13). The fact that PGE2 infusion
did not lower basal insulin levels may be a dose￾related phenomenon. Decreases in basal insulin levels
were observed in our previously reported experiments
in dogs given a PGE2 infuision rate of 10 ,sg/min
(11, 12). However, this infusion rate on a body weight
basis represents a fourfold greater rate in dogs than
in humans. Such dose dependency could explain why
the only other published data dealing with the effect
of prostaglandins upon eirculating insulin and glucose
in humans reported negative results (18). These in￾vestigators used lower doses of PGE2 than herein
reported, studied pregnant females during labor, and
did not investigate insulin responses to intravenous
glucose.
In general, previous reports (19-24) dealing with the
effect of salicylate upon insulin secretion and carbo￾hydrate tolerance have indicated that salicylates tend to
elevate circulating insulin and decrease circulating glu￾cose in humans. The earliest published report of a
lowering effect of sodium salicylate on glucose in
diabetics appears to have been by Ebstein (19)
in 1876. Subsequently, Field et al. (23) reported
in 1967 that sodium salicylate infusion in healthy
controls and patients with mild diabetes mellitus
(mean fasting blood glucose level of 83 mgldl)
caused an increase in circulating insulin. Althouigh
acute insulin responses were not investigated spe￾cifically, these autlhors did find that insulin levels 5
min after intravenous glucose infuision were signif￾icantly augmented by salicylate infuision. Since we
have now demonstrated that PGE2 infusions in man
have the opposite effects of salicylate infusion, it seems
likely that the mechanism of salicylate action upon
insulin secretion and carbohydrate tolerance may be
through inhibition of endogenous prostaglandin syn￾thesis. The recent demonstration by Hamberg (14) in
1972 that sodium salicylate is an effective inhibitor
of endogenous PGE2 synthesis in humans supports
this hypothesis. However, since salicylates are known
to have a variety of effects in humans, its effects on
insulin and glucose cannot be specifically ascribed to
inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis.
The only other drug which has been reported to
restore acute instulin responses to glucose in adult￾onset diabetics is phentolamine, an a-adrenergic antag￾onist (25). Compared to our findings with phentol￾amine the beneficial effect of sodiuim salicylate upon
acuite insuilin responses in diabetics appears to be
greater. Moreover, the effect of phentolamine upon
second phase instulin secretion was slight whereas
there was a foir-fold augmentatioin of second phase
secretion by salicylate. It is not known whether a￾adrenergic events and endogenous prostaglandins are
752 R. P. Robertson and M. Chen
related in a functional sense, although it has been
demonstrated that inhibition of insulin secretion by
PGE remains intact during a-adrenergic blockade (11,
13). In a more general sense, restoration of acute
insulin responses to glucose by agents such as phentol￾amine or salicylates indicates that the loss of this re￾sponse in adult-onset diabetes can not be due to
absolute endogenous insulin deficiency. Our previous
demonstration that acute insulin responses to 8-
adrenergic stimulation were intact in diabetics who
did not respond to intravenous glucose led us to ad￾vance the concept of defective glucose recognition by
pancreatic B-cells in diabetes (2). If glucose recogni￾tion is a major defect, the finding that this defect can
be at least partially reversed by drugs such as phentol￾amine or salicylate may have therapeutic implications.
More fundamentally, a more complete understanding
of a-adrenergic blockade and salicylate action may
provide fresh insights into the pathophysiology of
abnormal insulin secretion and glucose intolerance in
diabetes mellitus.
