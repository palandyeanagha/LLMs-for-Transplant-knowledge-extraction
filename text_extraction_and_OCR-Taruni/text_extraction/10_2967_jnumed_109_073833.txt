Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is the major determinant of
long-term survival after heart transplantation. We aimed to eval￾uate the efficacy of PET as a noninvasive way to assess the early
stages of CAV. Methods: Twenty-seven consecutive patients
(20 men and 7 women; mean age 6 SD, 46 6 12 y) who had nor￾mal results on coronary angiography and normal left ventricular
systolic function (ejection fraction $ 60%) were enrolled at
2.5 6 2.1 y after transplantation. Myocardial blood flow (MBF)
was assessed using dynamic 13N-ammonia PET at rest and dur￾ing adenosine-induced hyperemia, and myocardial perfusion re￾serve (MPR) was calculated as the ratio of hyperemic MBF to
resting MBF. Regional 13N-ammonia PET was assessed using
a 5-point scoring system. The intravascular ultrasound (IVUS)
measurements for the extent of intimal hyperplasia, including
plaque volume index (calculated as [total plaque volume/total
vessel volume] · 100%) and maximum area of stenosis, were
compared with MPR by linear regression analysis. Results: In
27 angiographically normal cardiac transplant recipients, MBF
at rest and during adenosine stress and MPR of the left anterior
descending artery distribution correlated strongly with the other
2 coronary artery distribution territories (r $ 0.97, P , 0.0001).
Summed stress score and summed difference score showed
a moderate inverse correlation with MPR (r 5 20.41 and 20.49,
respectively; P , 0.05) but not with IVUS measurements.
MPR correlated inversely with plaque volume index (r 5 20.40,
P , 0.05) but not with maximal luminal stenosis as assessed
by IVUS. In addition, MPR and IVUS measurements gradually
inversely changed after heart transplantation (all P , 0.05).
Conclusion: This study confirms that CAV is a progressive
process, diffusely involving the epicardial and microvascular
coronary system. Plaque burden as determined by IVUS agrees
well with MPR as assessed by PET in recipients with normal
coronary angiography results. This finding suggests that dy￾namic 13N-ammonia PET is clinically feasible for the early detec￾tion of CAV and can be used as a reliable marker of disease
progression.

Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is one of the
leading causes of late mortality after heart transplantation
(1,2). Early CAV is clinically silent, and ischemia is usually
not evident until the disease is far advanced. The traditional
annual coronary angiogram for surveillance is of limited
value because CAV is characterized by diffuse concentric
intimal thickening of both epicardial and intramyocardial
arteries and may thus be overlooked on a coronary angio￾gram. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) has been proposed
to be the most sensitive method for diagnosis of early CAV
(3–8). However, the invasiveness and the physical bulkiness
of IVUS catheters make the widespread application of
IVUS in the detection of CAV difficult (2–5).
Stress myocardial perfusion images, including SPECT and
PET, have been recognized as key diagnostic methods to
evaluate coronary artery disease (9–12). Stress myocardial
SPECT, in comparison with invasive coronary angiography,
frequently underestimates the extent and severity of CAV
(8,13–16). Recently, PET has come to be considered the
noninvasive gold standard. By quantification of the absolute
myocardial blood flow (MBF) during stress and rest, the
myocardial perfusion reserve (MPR) can be deduced to

represent the epicardial arteries or microvascular dysfunction
(17–20). Several studies involving patients with progressive
coronary artery disease (21–23), idiopathic cardiomyopa￾thies (24), and hypertrophic cardiomyopathies (25) have
suggested the prognostic value of quantitative PET. How￾ever, for cardiac transplantation recipients, MPR measured
by PET has been tested in only a few studies (26,27). A few
previous studies have yielded conflicting results in Doppler￾derived coronary flow reserve and morphologic change in
CAV (28–34). In addition, the impact of MPR by dynamic
PET on the prediction of graft failure is still inconclusive.
Therefore, we sought to compare myocardial perfusion and
MPR assessed by dynamic adenosine 13N-ammonia PET and
coronary morphologic changes measured by IVUS in angio￾graphically normal cardiac transplant recipients, to test the
value in detecting early stages of CAV.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Between January 2007 and May 2009, 27 consecutive re￾cipients (20 men and 7 women; mean age 6 SD, 46 6 12 y) who
had normal coronary angiography findings (7,8) and normal left
ventricular systolic function (ejection fraction $ 60%) were
enrolled at 2.5 6 2.1 y (range, 1–9.5 y) after cardiac trans￾plantation. For each recipient, PET and echocardiography were
performed within 1 mo of the invasive coronary angiography and
IVUS examination. The protocol was approved by the institutional
review board, and written informed consent was obtained from
each patient before enrollment.
IVUS
After the diagnostic coronary angiography, 5,000 U of in￾travenous heparin were administered and a 6-F guiding catheter
was inserted in the left main coronary artery. The IVUS catheter
(Atlantis SR Pro 2.5F, 40-MHz; Boston Scientific) was advanced
so that the IVUS transducer was positioned at the distal left
anterior descending coronary artery (LAD). The motorized IVUS
transducer was pulled back at a constant rate of 1 mm/s along the
length ($50 mm) of the vessel to the ostium of the left main
coronary artery. Two experienced readers, who did not know the
PET findings, were responsible for analyzing the IVUS records
using the resident software (Galax system; Boston Scientific). The
plaque volume index was quantitatively measured according to the
method of Pethig et al. (30), with slight modifications (7,8). In
brief, serial cross-sectional areas (in mm2) of lumen and vessel,
defined as the areas within the intimal border and within the
external elastic membrane, respectively, were determined every
2 mm along the entire length assessed. The plaque area was de￾fined as the vessel minus the lumen. The percentage of area ste￾nosis was then calculated as (plaque area/vessel) · 100%. The
luminal, vessel, and plaque volumes (in mm3) of each segment
were calculated as cross-sectional areas (lumen, vessel, and plaque
areas) · segment length of 2 mm. Total volumes of lumen, vessel,
and plaque were obtained by adding the measurements of all
vascular segments. A plaque volume index, defined as (total
plaque volume/total vessel volume) · 100, was used to normalize
the individual variations in the vessel and in the vessel length as
assessed by IVUS.
PET13N-ammonia PET was performed at rest and during adeno￾sine stress at a standard rate (0.14 mg/min/kg of body weight)
over 6 min, as previously reported (35). Individual patients re￾ceived a 740- to 925-MBq injection of 13N-ammonia into a
peripheral vein over 30 s by a volumetric pump. Images were
acquired in 2-dimensional mode on an Advance PET scanner (GE
Healthcare), within a field of view between 14.45 and 15.7 cm.
The optimal imaging position was determined on a 2-min short
transmission scan with an external 68Ge source. Dynamic emis￾sion scans were obtained using a standard protocol consisting of
12 · 10-s, 4 · 15-s, 4 · 30-s, and 3 · 300-s frames and a matrix
of 128 · 128, followed by reconstruction using ordered-subset
expectation maximization. Transmission scanning for photon
attenuation correction was performed with an external 68Ge
source. The PET datasets were moved to a Xeleris workstation
(GE Healthcare) by DICOM transfer. For review, the images were
resliced in short-axis and vertical and horizontal long-axis
orientations.
PET Data Analysis
Regional 13N-ammonia PET results were assessed using a 17-
segment model and a semiquantitative scoring system of the severity
and extent of the defect, as recommended by the American Heart
Society of Nuclear Cardiology (9,36,37). Each segment was scored
using a 5-point system based on the severity of tracer uptake (0 5
normal, 1 5 equivocal, 2 5 moderate, 3 5 severe, and 4 5 apparent
absence of tracer uptake). Summed scores were calculated from
these segmental scores, including a summed rest score (the sum of
the 17 segmental rest scores) and summed stress score (the sum of
the 17 segmental stress scores). A summed difference score (the
difference between summed stress and rest scores) was calculated.
The extent of ischemia was expressed as the percentage of ischemic
myocardium (summed difference score/68 · 100): ,2.5% was
considered nonischemic, 2.5%28% was considered slight to
moderate ischemia, and $8% was considered extensive ischemia,
as modified from Zellweger et al. (38). PET image interpretation
according to these definitions was performed by 2 experienced
readers who had no access to the IVUS records. Diverging in￾terpretations were classified by consensus. Quantitative MBF at rest
and during adenosine stress was determined using 13N-ammonia
PET. Previously validated compartmental modeling techniques were

applied to the time–activity curves to obtain regional estimates of
MBF (mL/g/min) (39) using the PMOD software package (version
2.8; PMOD Technologies Ltd.) (23). MPR was calculated as the
ratio of hyperemic to resting MBF, and values of 2.0 or more were
considered normal (40).
Statistical Analysis
Data were expressed as mean 6 SD. Comparisons were made
using the Student test for continuous variables and x2 analysis for
categoric variables. ANOVA was performed to detect any associ￾ations between 2 or more variables. IVUS measurements were
compared with PET variables by linear regression analysis. All
analyses were performed using STATA (release 10.0; StataCorp
LP) statistical software. All statistical tests were 2-sided, and a P
value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS
A total of 27 cardiac transplant recipients with patent
coronary angiograms were included in the study. Relevant
baseline characteristics of the patients are reported in Table
1. All patients received standard immunosuppressive ther￾apy as previously described (7,8,13–15). Based on con￾current endomyocardial biopsy findings, none had acute
rejection of grade II or higher (according to the system of
the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplanta￾tion) during the IVUS study (41).
IVUS and PET were successfully performed on all 27
patients, and no complications occurred. The mean and

semiquantitative PET analysis, the summed stress score,
summed rest score, and summed difference score were

based on the extent of ischemia was 20 (74%), 3 (11%), 3
(11%), and 1 (4%) for no ischemia, slight ischemia,
moderate ischemia, and extensive ischemia, respectively.
MBF at rest or during adenosine stress, and the MPR of the
LAD distribution, correlated strongly between the other 2
coronary artery distribution territories (r $ 0.97, P ,
0.0001, Table 2), suggesting that CAV involved the 3 major
coronary arteries to a similar degree. Representative images
of quantitative and qualitative assessment by rest and
adenosine stress 13N-ammonia PET are shown in Figures
1 and 2.
There were moderate inverse correlations between
summed stress score, summed difference score, and the
MPR of the global myocardium (r 5 20.41 and 20.49,
respectively; P , 0.05) but not IVUS parameters. There
was no significant correlation between IVUS parameters
and MBF at rest. In contrast, stress MBF and MPR
correlated inversely with plaque volume index measured
by IVUS (both r 5 20.40 in LAD territory, whereas
r 5 20.46 and 20.36, respectively, in global myocardium;
all P , 0.05) but not maximal luminal stenosis (Fig. 3). In
the 20 cases regarded as nonischemic by semiquantitative
PET analysis, a global myocardium MPR of 2 or more in 4
subjects (20%) was noted, suggesting diffuse coronary
lesions with balanced ischemia.

PET OF MYOCARDIAL FLOW RESERVE IN CAV • Wu et al. 909

Furthermore, we compared the patient characteristics
with the results of PET or IVUS. With the exception of
posttransplantation time, no significant correlations were
found between clinical characteristics (including pretrans￾plantation diagnosis, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hy￾perlipidemia, sex or age, or number of cardiac risk factors)
and PET or IVUS parameters. Although the coronary
angiograms showed patency for all subjects, the MPR of
the LAD territory or global myocardium deteriorated, and
IVUS parameters (both plaque volume index and maximal
luminal stenoses) increased as the time after heart trans￾plantation increased (all P , 0.05) (Fig. 4).
DISCUSSION
Because of the low sensitivity of coronary angiography,
IVUS and Doppler-derived coronary flow reserve have been
considered the standards in the diagnosis of CAV (1–3).
However, clinical application is limited because the pro￾cedure is invasive and time-consuming and requires highly
trained medical personnel. The current study demonstrated
that the vasodilation capacity and perfusion abnormalities
detected by PET correlated well with the coronary mor￾phologic changes in IVUS.
The main advantage of PET is its superior spatial
resolution and the possibility of noninvasive assess￾ment of absolute quantitative MBF, from which MPR can
be calculated. The assessment of quantitative regional
MBF and MPR with 13N-ammonia PET has been well
established. 13N-ammonia dynamic PET blood flow
measurements include integrated vasodilation capacity,
endothelium-related vasomotor function, and epicardial
conduit vessel function (42,43). MBF and MPR not only
can provide important diagnostic and prognostic informa￾tion (10–12,20–25) but also can be used as a surrogate
endpoint to assess therapeutic response (44–48) and to
guide interventions aimed at reducing cardiac risks or
ischemic burden in subjects with native coronary artery
disease (49).
CAV is a progressive process involving the epicardial and
microvascular coronary systems. Conflicting results in
IVUS- and Doppler-derived coronary flow reserve studies
(7,8,28–34,50–52) suggest that the correlation between
endothelial dysfunction and coronary changes is complex.
Studies in the past have shown that dynamic PET provides
information complementary to coronary anatomy. By using
dipyridamole 13N-ammonia PET, Preumont et al. (27)
found that MBF reserve was impaired early after heart
transplantation and restored within 1 y in heart transplant
recipients free of allograft rejection and with normal
coronary angiography findings. Allen-Auerbach et al. (26)
found that the degree of vasodilatory capacity detected by
PET is associated with morphologic indices of disease
progression as assessed by IVUS at 1–2 y after trans￾plantation. However, the sample sizes were rather small,
and posttransplantation durations were short. Whether
dynamic PET is enough to assess patients at risk of CAV
remains to be determined.
Consistent with previous reports, our study confirmed
that semiquantitative 13N-ammonia PET is superior to
invasive coronary angiography in the detection of CAV.
Through the use of dynamic PET, an additional 20% of
subjects who had normal semiquantitative PET results were
found to have impaired coronary flow reserve. Moreover,
the severity of the impairment inversely correlated with the
coronary plaque burden as assessed by IVUS. This finding
demonstrated the superiority of coronary flow reserve over
perfusion scans alone, partly because CAV involves multi￾ple vessels so that regional perfusion abnormalities could
be masked by diffuse lesions with balanced ischemia on
qualitative images. Therefore, dynamic 13N-ammonia PET
is a better, more reliable noninvasive tool for the detection
of early CAV and disease progression. A preserved coro￾nary flow reserve as assessed by dynamic PET may obviate

invasive coronary angiography and IVUS surveillance in
transplant recipients.
The study had some limitations. First, the number of
recipients included was small, and they were heterogeneous
in coronary risk factors, donor age, immunosuppressive
protocols, and history of myocardial rejections. Second, in
this cross-section study, not all patients underwent IVUS
immediately after transplantation; therefore, it is difficult to
differentiate donor-transmitted coronary artery disease
from CAV. In addition, there is not a clear MPR cutoff
value to recognize more altered vessels, and the predictive
value of 13N-ammonia PET for long-term clinical outcome
is not yet known. A large-scale prospective study of serial
quantitative IVUS and PET measurements to assess the
progression of CAV and to elucidate the prognostic value of
quantitative PET in posttransplant recipients is needed.
CONCLUSION
Using noninvasive 13N-ammonia PET, this study con￾firmed that CAV is a progressive and diffuse process
involving the epicardial and microvascular coronary sys￾tem. There is good agreement between plaque burden as
determined by IVUS and MPR as assessed by PET in
recipients with normal coronary angiography findings. The
findings of this study suggest that quantitative measurement
of myocardial flow using dynamic 13N-ammonia PET is
clinically feasible for the early detection of CAV and could
be used as a reliable marker of disease progression.
