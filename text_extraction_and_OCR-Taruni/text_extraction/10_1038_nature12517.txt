Abstract
The complexity of the human brain has made it difficult to study many brain disorders in model
organisms, and highlights the need for an in vitro model of human brain development. We have
developed a human pluripotent stem cell-derived 3D organoid culture system, termed cerebral
organoid, which develops various discrete though interdependent brain regions. These include
cerebral cortex containing progenitor populations that organize and produce mature cortical
neuron subtypes. Furthermore, cerebral organoids recapitulate features of human cortical
development, namely characteristic progenitor zone organization with abundant outer radial glial
stem cells. Finally, we use RNAi and patient-specific iPS cells to model microcephaly, a disorder
that has been difficult to recapitulate in mice. We demonstrate premature neuronal differentiation
in patient organoids, a defect that could explain the disease phenotype. Our data demonstrate that
3D organoids can recapitulate development and disease of even this most complex human tissue.
Introduction
Mammalian brain development begins with expansion of the neuroepithelium to generate
radial glia (RG)1
. These RGs divide at the apical surface within the ventricular zone (VZ) to
generate neurons and intermediate progenitors (IPs). IPs populate the adjacent
subventricular zone (SVZ) while neurons migrate through the intermediate zone (IZ) to
populate specific layers within the cortical plate (CP). In humans, the organization of
progenitor zones is markedly more elaborate; the SVZ is split by an inner fiber layer (IFL)
into inner (ISVZ) and outer SVZ (OSVZ)2
. The OSVZ represents an entirely separate
progenitor layer populated by IPs and a unique stem cell termed outer radial glia (oRG)3,4
,
which are only present to a limited degree in rodents5
. Both the IFL and OSVZ are

completely absent in mice6
. These key differences allow for the striking expansion in
neuronal output and brain size seen in humans7,8
.
Primary microcephaly (MCPH) is a neurodevelopmental disorder in which brain size is
markedly reduced9
. Autosomal recessive mutations have been identified in several genes, all
of which encode proteins localizing to the mitotic spindle apparatus10. Heretofore, MCPH
pathogenesis has primarily been examined in mouse models. However, mouse mutants for
several of the known genes11-14 have failed to recapitulate the severely reduced brain size
seen in human patients.
Given the dramatic differences between mice and humans, methods that recapitulate
paradigms of human brain development in vitro have enormous potential. While significant
progress has been made for in vitro models of whole organ development for other systems,
such as intestine15, pituitary16, and retina17,18, a 3D culture model of the developing brain as
a whole has not been established. Previous studies have modeled certain isolated neural
tissues in vitro
19-23, including dorsal cerebral cortical tissue, which could recapitulate many
aspects of early development. However, later events such as the formation of discrete
cortical layers with stereotypic inside-out organization as well as human characteristics,
such as the presence of oRG cells and the unique organization of progenitor zones, were not
described.
Here, we describe a 3D culture system for deriving brain tissue in vitro. These so-called
cerebral organoids develop a variety of regional identities organized as discrete domains
capable of influencing one another. Furthermore, cerebral cortical regions display an
organization similar to the developing human brain at early stages, as well as the presence of
a considerable oRG population. Moreover, cerebral cortical neurons mature to form various
pyramidal identities with modest spatial separation. Finally, we utilize patient-derived iPSCs
and shRNA in these organoids to model CDK5RAP2 dependent pathogenesis of
microcephaly, a disorder that has been difficult to model in mice.
Results
Generation of cerebral organoids
Recent progress with in vitro models of various organ systems has demonstrated the
enormous self-organizing capacity for pluripotent stem cells to form whole tissues15,18. We
built upon this concept and developed a protocol without the use of patterning growth
factors, focusing instead on improving growth conditions and providing the environment
necessary for intrinsic cues to influence development. We began with a modified approach
to generate neuroectoderm from embryoid bodies24. Neuroectodermal tissues were then
maintained in 3D culture and embedded in droplets of Matrigel to provide a scaffold for
more complex tissue growth. These Matrigel droplets were then transferred to a spinning
bioreactor to enhance nutrient absorption (Figure 1a). This method led to rapid development
of brain tissues, which we termed cerebral organoids, requiring only 8-10 days for the
appearance of neural identity and 20-30 days for defined brain regions to form.
Cerebral organoids at early stages (15-20 days) formed large, continuous neuroepithelia
surrounding a fluid-filled cavity reminiscent of a ventricle with characteristic apical
localization of the neural specific N-cadherin (Figure 1b). Furthermore, the neuroepithelium
was larger and more continuous than tissues generated using a stationary approach20, which
instead formed an aggregate of several small rosette-like neuroepithelia (Figure 1b,
Extended Data Figure 1a).

Although tissues reached maximal size by 2 months, cerebral organoids formed large (up to
4 mm in diameter), complex heterogeneous tissues, which could survive indefinitely
(currently up to 10 months) when maintained in a spinning bioreactor. Histological and
gross morphological analysis revealed regions reminiscent of cerebral cortex, choroid
plexus, retina, and meninges (Figure 1c,d, Extended Data Figure 1b). Importantly, tissues
typically reached a size limit likely due to the lack of a circulatory system and limitations in
oxygen and nutrient exchange. Consistent with this, extensive cell death was visible in the
core of these tissues (Extended Data Figure 1c), whereas the various brain regions
developed along the exterior. Furthermore, cerebral organoids could be reproducibly
generated with similar overall morphology and complexity from both human ES cells and
induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) (Extended Data Figure 1d, e).
Cerebral organoids display discrete brain regions
Brain development in vivo exhibits a striking degree of heterogeneity and regionalization as
well as interdependency of various brain regions. Histological analysis suggested that
human cerebral organoids might similarly display heterogeneous brain regions. To further
examine this, we first tested the efficiency of initial neural induction in these tissues by
performing RT-PCR for several markers of pluripotency and neural identity (Extended Data
Figure 2a). As expected, pluripotency markers Oct4 and Nanog diminished during the
course of organoid differentiation, while neural identity markers Sox1 and Pax6 were
upregulated, indicating successful neural induction.
To test for early brain regionalization in whole organoids, we performed RT-PCR for
forebrain (BF1 and Six3) and hindbrain (Krox20 and Isl1) markers (Figure 2a), revealing the
presence of both populations within the tissue. However, as tissue development proceeded,
forebrain markers remained highly expressed while hindbrain markers decreased,
reminiscent of the developmental expansion of forebrain tissue during human brain
development25
.
In order to test whether cells with these brain region identities developed as discrete regions
within the organoids, as gross morphology would suggest, or were randomly interspersed
within the tissue, we performed immunohistochemical staining for markers of forebrain,
midbrain and hindbrain identities during early development of these tissues (16 days, Figure
2b, Extended Data Figure 2b). Pax6 expression revealed several regions of forebrain
identity, and Otx1/2 expression marked forebrain/midbrain identity. These regions were
located adjacent to regions lacking these markers but positive for hindbrain markers Gbx2,
Krox20, and Pax2, which was reminiscent of the early midhindbrain boundary, suggesting
similar regional communication and likely mutual repression.
In vivo brain development involves increasing refinement of regional specification.
Therefore, we examined further developed cerebral organoid tissues for regional
subspecification. We performed staining for the forebrain marker FoxG1 (Figure 2c), which
labeled regions displaying typical cerebral cortical morphology. Many of these regions were
also positive for Emx1 (Figure 2d), indicating dorsal cortical identity. We also tested for
further subregionalization by staining for cortical lobe markers, namely Auts2, a marker of
prefrontal cortex26 (Figure 2e), Tshz2, a marker of the occipital lobe26 (Extended Data
Figure 2c), and Lmo4, a marker of frontal and occipital lobes but absent in parietal26
(Extended Data Figure 2c). These markers could be seen in neurons labeling distinct regions
of dorsal cortex, suggesting subspecification of cortical lobes.
Furthermore, staining for markers of hippocampus (Figure 2f) and ventral forebrain (Figure
2g), revealed specification of these regions, although they did not organize to form the
overall structure seen in vivo. Strikingly, interneurons produced in ventral forebrain regions

exhibited a morphology and location consistent with migration from ventral to dorsal tissues
(Extended Data Figure 2d). Within dorsal cortex, these neurons displayed neurites parallel to
the apical surface, reminiscent of the migratory extensions seen in tangential migration in
vivo (Figure 2h). Notably, Calretinin positive interneurons were absent from dorsal cortex of
organoids lacking a ventral region (4/4 Nkx2.1 negative organoids), suggesting interneurons
originate in ventral forebrain to migrate to the dorsal cortex. This suggests distant regions
can influence one another in developing cerebral organoids.
Finally, other brain structures could be observed, namely choroid plexus (Figure 2i) and
even immature retina (Figure 2j). Overall, all tissues examined displayed regions with dorsal
cortical morphology (35/35, 100%), most displayed choroid plexus (25/35, 71%) and several
displayed ventral forebrain identity as determined by Nkx2.1 immunoreactivity (12/35,
34%), whereas only a few displayed retinal tissue (determined by presence of retinal
pigmented epithelium, 4/35, 11%). These results suggest that cerebral organoids developed a
variety of brain region identities organized into discrete, though interdependent, domains.
Recapitulation of dorsal cortical organization
The most dramatic changes in brain evolution from rodent to human affect the dorsal cortex.
Therefore, we analyzed the organization of dorsal cortical regions within cerebral organoids.
Staining for markers of RGs and newborn neurons (Figure 3a) revealed typical organization
into a layer reminiscent of the VZ with neurons located at the basal surface. Staining for
Tbr1 (Figure 3b) revealed proper development of neural identity and radial migration to the
developing preplate (precursor to CP) . Furthermore, staining for neural progenitor and
neural specific BAF components revealed the characteristic switch in chromatin remodeling
complexes during neural fate specification27,28(Extended Data Figure 3a). Finally, staining
for the IP marker Tbr2 (Figure 3c) revealed the presence of IPs adjacent to the VZ. Thus,
dorsal cortical tissues displayed typical progenitor zone organization.
In both mice and humans, cortical progenitors undergo a stereotypical nuclear movement
called interkinetic nuclear migration (IKNM). Mitotic divisions occur at the apical surface of
the VZ while nuclei of cells in S-phase are located on the basal side of the VZ29. We stained
for the mitotic marker phospho-histone H3 (PH3) (Figure 3d) and observed the majority of
cells dividing at the apical surface. Similar observations were evident when we stained for
phospho-Vimentin (Figure 3e), a marker of mitotic RGs. In addition, since this marker
labels the entire cell, we could observe basal cellular processes typical of RGs, which
extended to the outer surface of these tissues (Extended Data Figure 3b). Thus, RGs of
cerebral organoids exhibited typical behavior and morphological features.
To examine this in more detail, we used a method to label individual RGs for morphology
and live imaging experiments. In the mouse brain, individual cells can be labeled by in utero
electroporation of fluorescent protein-expressing plasmids. Similarly, we injected GFP
plasmid into fluid filled cavities of cerebral organoids and electroporated RGs adjacent to
these ventricle-like cavities (Extended Data Figure 3c). This approach led to reproducible
expression of GFP in RGs revealing typical morphology at various stages of development:
early pseudostratified neuroepithelium (Extended Data Figure 3d) followed by later bipolar
morphology with extended apical and basal processes (Extended Data Figure 3e, f).
To test for IKNM, we performed live imaging of GFP electroporated RGs in cerebral
organoids and observed many examples of RGs that displayed movement of the cell body
along the apical and basal processes (Figure 3f, Supplementary Video 1). Furthermore, we
performed pulse-chase experiments with the S-phase marker BrdU (Figure 3g) and could
observe a shift in RG nuclei from outer VZ localization towards the apical surface with time
(Figure 3g).

RGs in the VZ of rodents exhibit biased spindle orientation, predominantly horizontal,
parallel to the ventricular surface30-33. To examine whether RGs in human cerebral
organoids exhibited a similar orientation bias, we used P-Vimentin staining to examine the
plane of division in mitotic RGs (Extended Data Figure 3g). We observed mainly horizontal
orientations (41%) (Figure 3h), somewhat similar to the orientation bias observed in other
mammals. However, we also observed abundant oblique (37%) and vertical (22%)
orientations, which were more abundant in these human tissues than has been described for
rodent neocortex30,31,34,35. Interestingly, these measurements reflected the same trend
recently described in the human brain36, suggesting the cerebral organoids could recapitulate
aspects of human cortical development.
We further examined the fate potential of these divisions to test whether organoid RGs could
divide symmetrically and/or asymmetrically. We performed electroporation of GFP
followed by a short 1-hour BrdU pulse and a 16-hour chase to lineage trace divisions of a
small minority of cells. We examined double-labeled daughter cell pairs and could observe
both symmetric proliferative fate outcomes, as well as asymmetric outcomes (Figure 3i).
This suggests the RGs in these human tissues can undergo both symmetric and asymmetric
divisions.
Formation of functional cerebral cortical neurons
The formation of the radially organized CP begins with the formation of its precursor, the
preplate. To test for this initial organization, we stained 30-day organoids for Tbr1, a marker
of the preplate37, as well as Map2, a neuronal marker38 (Figure 4a). This revealed the
presence of a basal neural layer reminiscent of the preplate, and an apically adjacent region
reminiscent of the IZ. Furthermore, we could observe Reelin positive neurons along the
basal surface, suggesting the presence of Cajal-Retzius cells, an important population in
generation of CP architecture39
.
The stereotypical layered structure of the mammalian CP is generated inside-out with later￾born neurons migrating through existing layers to populate more superficial layers40
.
Although previous methods of deriving cortical neurons have been able to generate distinct
layer identities20,23,41, they have been unable to recapitulate this spatial separation. To test
whether this organization could be recapitulated in cerebral organoids, we stained for
cortical layer markers. In less developed tissues (30-day), early born Ctip2 neurons were
located adjacent and internal to the Tbr1+ preplate, suggesting initiation of CP layer
formation (Extended Data Figure 4a). Furthermore, neurons exhibited rudimentary
separation into early-born deep layer (Ctip2+) and late-born superficial layer (Satb2+ and
Brn2+) (Extended Data Figure 4b), which became more distinct as tissues developed (75-
days) (Figure 4c). Finally, a cell-poor region reminiscent of the marginal zone was also
evident (Extended Data Figure 1b). Importantly, although this modest spatial separation was
an improvement upon other in vitro methods, organoids could not recapitulate the same
degree of mature layer organization as in vivo, suggesting further cues are needed to
generate the complex stereotypical layer II-VI organization.
In vivo, dorsal cortical neurons mature and extend long-range axons42. To test for these
characteristics, we performed GFP electroporation and examined neuronal morphology.
GFP-labeled axon projections displayed complex branching and growth cone behavior
(Extended Data Figure 4c) and projected long-range axons in a manner reminiscent of axon
bundling (Extended Data Figure 4d)43
.
Finally, we tested whether neurons within cerebral organoids could exhibited neural activity
by performing calcium dye imaging to detect Ca2+ oscillations44, which revealed
spontaneous calcium surges in individual cells (Figure 4d, Extended Data Figure 4e and
Lancaster et al. Page 5

Supplementary Videos 2, 3). Furthermore, we applied exogenous glutamate (Figure 4e) and
observed more frequent calcium spikes, indicating glutamatergic receptor activity. Finally,
we performed action potential blockade by application of tetrodotoxin (TTX) and observed
dampened calcium surges indicating calcium spikes were dependent upon neuronal activity
(Figure 4f).
Recapitulation of human cerebral cortical organization
Human brain development exhibits unique progenitor zone organization2,7. To test whether
features of human brain development were recapitulated in cerebral organoids, we examined
the distribution of Sox2+ progenitors and observed a population displaced from the apical
surface (Figure 5a, Extended Data Figure 5a) consistent with an oRG identity. Furthermore,
these fairly abundant oRGs appeared separated from the apical VZ by a Tuj1+ fiber layer
(Figure 5a) reminiscent of the IFL. This organization suggests human cerebral organoids
could recapitulate at least some aspects of human cortical development.
To rule out the possibility that this OSVZ-like organization was an in vitro artifact, we
adapted the method to mouse ES cells to generate mouse cerebral organoids and examined
whether a similar organization was present (Extended Data Figure 5b and c). We observed
much smaller cortical tissues in mouse organoids compared with human, and only
occasional oRGs that did not accumulate in an OSVZ-like region. These results suggest
OSVZ and IFL-like layers are specific to human organoids.
We performed P-Vimentin staining to examine the morphology of human oRGs, which
revealed basal processes but a lack of apical processes (Figure 5b), a hallmark of oRGs3,4
.
This suggests these basally displaced Sox2 and P-Vimentin positive progenitors indeed
represent human oRGs. We also examined the division mode of oRGs and could identify
daughter cell pairs in which only one daughter cell maintained Sox2 expression (Figure 5c)
suggesting asymmetric division. Furthermore, we measured spindle orientation and found
that the vast majority of oRGs divided vertically (Figure 5d). This division mode is
remarkably similar to the findings recently described by LaMonica et al. in human brain
slice cultures36 suggesting recapitulation of human oRG behavior in cerebral organoids.
Cerebral organoids model human microcephaly
Since disorders affecting human brain development have often proved difficult to
recapitulate in animal models, we tested whether organoids could be used to model
neurodevelopmental disorders. We identified a patient with severe microcephaly (−13.2 s.d.
below mean for age and sex, Figure 6a) and reduced stature (−6.7 s.d., Supplemental Text,
Extended Data Figure 6a), who, as determined through exome sequencing and confirmed by
capillary sequencing (Figure 6b), had compound heterozygous truncating mutations in
CDK5RAP2. Skin fibroblasts from this patient revealed a loss of the CDK5RAP2 protein
(Figure 6c, Extended Data Figure 6b) suggesting loss of function, consistent with previously
reported CDK5RAP2 mutations in primary microcephaly patients45,46
.
We performed reprogramming of patient skin fibroblasts using lentiviral delivery of the four
well-described reprogramming factors: Oct4, Sox2, c-Myc, and Klf447,48. We generated
many independent clones of iPSCs and characterized four of these for morphology and
pluripotency. All four lines exhibited similar doubling times and colony morphology that
was indistinguishable from control iPSCs (Extended Data Figure 7a). All lines could form
embryoid bodies and stained positive for the pluripotency marker alkaline phosphatase
(Extended Data Figure 7b).
We performed cerebral organoid culture from all 4 lines and observed smaller EBs, which
when transferred to neural induction failed to develop further (Extended Data Figure 7c).

We hypothesized that since the patient also displayed reduced stature, perhaps overall EB
growth was perturbed. Therefore, in order to allow the EBs to develop to a comparable size
as control, we modified the protocol slightly by increasing the initial iPSC number. This
modification allowed for the formation of neuroectoderm and subsequent neural tissue for
analysis, which revealed smaller neuroepithelial tissues and a large degree of neuronal
outgrowth compared with control tissues (Figure 6d and Extended Data Figure 7d).
Immunohistochemical staining for progenitors and neurons revealed smaller neural tissues
with only very few progenitor regions (Figure 6e). These overall smaller neural tissues were
reminiscent of the reduced brain size seen in the patient.
These patient-derived cerebral organoids provided a unique opportunity to examine the
cause of the hypoplasia seen in microcephaly. We therefore examined an earlier stage (22
days) and observed that, whereas control tissues displayed abundant, large neuroepithelial
tissues composed of progenitors, patient-derived tissues displayed only occasional
neuroepithelial regions (Extended Data Figure 7e). Furthermore, these tissues displayed
decreased RGs and increased neurons compared with control (Figure 6f, Extended Data
Figure 7f) suggesting premature neural differentiation. To test this possibility, we performed
BrdU pulse-chase experiments (Figure 6g) revealing a dramatic increase in the number of
BrdU+/DCX+ cells in patient organoids, consistent with premature neurogenic non￾proliferative divisions.
We furthermore examined radial glial spindle orientation and observed that, whereas control
tissues at this early stage (22 days) displayed exclusively horizontal orientations (Figure 6h),
patient organoids displayed many oblique and vertical oriented spindles (Figure 6h). These
results could explain the patient tissue phenotype since precise horizontal orientation of the
spindle is necessary for early symmetric expansion of neural stem cells32
.
Finally, we tested whether the phenotype could be rescued by reintroducing CDK5RAP2
protein. We performed coelectroporation of GFP and CDK5RAP2 into day 12 patient
organoids and examined 6 days later. Since high overexpression of CDK5RAP2 was toxic
(data not shown), the cells with high GFP signal did not survive to this time point. However,
we could observe regions in CDK5RAP2 electroporated tissues with larger neuroepithelium
compared with tissues electroporated only with GFP (Extended Data Figure 7g). This effect
could be due to surviving cells with a low-level of CDK5RAP2 re-expression. Supporting
this interpretation, staining for GFP (Extended Data Figure 7h) revealed many low-level
GFP+ cells in CDK5RAP2 coelectroporated patient organoids with radial glial morphology
(54%±2 SEM, n=74 cells from 3 tissues). In contrast, GFP+ cells in patient organoids
electroporated with GFP alone exhibited mainly neuronal morphology with significantly
fewer radial glia (19%±11 SEM, n=102 cells from 3 tissues, P<0.05, Student’s t-test). Thus,
we conclude that the phenotype is specific to loss of CDK5RAP2.
As a further independent approach, we performed RNAi knockdown of CDK5RAP2 by
coelectroporating GFP with two independent shRNAs found to knockdown endogenous
CDK5RAP2 (Extended Data Figure 8a). Both shRNAs led to a striking loss of Sox2+
progenitors and an increase in DCX+ neurons (Figure 6i, Extended Data Figure 8b)
reflecting a statistically significant increase in neuron production rather than progenitor
maintenance (Extended Data Figure 8c). These findings support the conclusion that loss of
CDK5RAP2 leads to premature neural differentiation at the expense of progenitors.
Discussion
We have established a novel approach to studying human neurodevelopmental processes
through in vitro culture of cerebral organoids from human pluripotent stem cells. This

method recapitulates not only fundamental mechanisms of mammalian neurodevelopment,
but also displays characteristics of human brain development. We are hopeful that this
method will allow the study of a variety of neurodevelopmental processes specific to human
brain development.
Furthermore, a primary goal in neuroscience is to understand the roots of human
neurological disease. We have modeled at least some aspects of microcephaly in these
cerebral organoids. The finding that progenitor zones in patient-derived tissues display
premature neural differentiation at the expense of early progenitors supports a model in
which the founder population of RG progenitors fails to properly expand in patient tissues,
thereby leading to an overall smaller brain. This may also explain why mouse models have
been unable to recapitulate the severity of the disorder in humans. It is hypothesized that the
mouse founder population of neural progenitors do not undergo expansion to the same
extent as in human before the onset of neurogenesis7
. Thus, a disruption of the founder
population in mice would not lead to as severe an effect as that seen in humans. Overall, our
findings suggest we can utilize this in vitro culture system to model aspects of human
neurodevelopment and neurological disease and hopefully provide novel insight into
pathogenesis of these disorders.
Methods
Plasmid constructs and materials
GFP plasmid used for co-electroporation with shRNA and for live imaging was pCAG-GFP
(Addgene plasmid 11150)51. shRNAs targeting human CDK5RAP2 were cloned using
pSuper shRNA expression strategy (OligoEngine). Targeting sequences were as follows:
shRNA 1 AGGACGTGTTGCTTCAGAAAT, shRNA 2
AGAGTCAGCCTTCTGCTAAAG, shRNA 3 GTGGAAGATCTCCTAACTAAA, shRNA
4 ACTATGAGACTGCTCTATCAG. The CDK5RAP2 expression construct was generated
using the Gateway system (Invitrogen) by PCR amplification of CDK5RAP2 from MGC
human CDK5RAP2 cDNA (clone ID: 9052276) using the primers with AttB sites: Forward:

TC. CDK5RAP2 was cloned into destination vector pcDNA3.1/nV5-DEST.
Cerebral organoid culture conditions
Human H9 ES (WA09) were obtained from WiCell at passage 26 with verified normal
karyotype and contamination-free. iPS cells were obtained from System Biosciences
(SC101A-1) verified pluripotent and contamination free. All human PSC lines were
regularly checked and confirmed negative for mycoplasma. PSCs were maintained on CF-1
gamma irradiated MEFs (Global Stem) according to WiCell protocols. On day 0 of organoid
culture, ESCs or iPSCs less than passage 50 were dissociated from MEFs by dispase
treatment and MEFs were removed by gravity separation of stem cell colonies from MEFs
before trypsinization of stem cells to generate single cells. 4500 cells were then plated in
each well of an ultra-low binding 96-well plate (Corning) in hES media with low bFGF (5-
fold reduced) and 50uM ROCK inhibitor49 (Calbiochem).
EBs were fed every other day for 6 days then transferred to low adhesion 24-well plates
(Corning) in neural induction media containing DMEM/F12, 1:100 N2 supplement
(Invitrogen), Glutamax (Invitrogen), MEM-NEAA, and 1ug/ml Heparin50 (Sigma). These
began forming neuroepithelial tissues, which were fed every other day for 5 days. On Day
11 of the protocol, tissues were transferred to droplets of Matrigel (BD Biosciences) by

pipetting into cold Matrigel on a sheet of Parafilm with small 3mm dimples. These droplets
were allowed to gel at 37C and were subsequently removed from the Parafilm and grown in
differentiation media containing a 1:1 mixture of DMEM/F12 and Neurobasal containing
1:200 N2 supplement (Invitrogen), 1:100 B27 supplement without vitamin A (Invitrogen),
3.5ul/L 2-mercaptoethanol, 1:4000 insulin (Sigma), 1:100 Glutamax (Invitrogen), 1:200
MEM-NEAA.
After 4 days of stationary growth, the tissue droplets were transferred to a spinning
bioreactor containing differentiation media as above except B27 supplement with vitamin A
(Invitrogen) was used. Since retinoic acid has been shown to be important for neuronal
differentiation in vivo
52, we included it in the final media used to differentiate the cerebral
organoids.
Mouse organoid culture conditions
Mouse A9 ES cells were cultured on Mitomycin C growth inactivated MEFs and passaged
according to standard protocols53. For the generation of mouse organoids, the organoid
protocol was applied with the following modifications: cells were trypsinized and 2000 stem
cells were plated in each well of an ultra-low binding 96-well plate in differentiation
medium as described by Eiraku et al.20 (Medium containing 10uM SB431542 but without
Dkk-1). Subsequent steps were followed according to the human organoid method using
identical media compositions, with the exception that for mouse tissues faster timing was
used according to morphology. EBs were transferred to neural induction medium on day 4,
embedded in matrigel droplets on day 6, and on day 9 transferred to the spinning bioreactor.
Organoid electroporation
Electroporation was performed using a petri dish tissue electrode and electro-square-porator
(ECM 830) both from BTX Harvard Apparatus. A total of 3ul of 2ug/ul total plasmid (GFP
for live imaging, 1.8ug/ul shRNA + 0.2ug/ul GFP for shRNA experiments) was injected in
4-5 locations within the organoid and electroporation was performed in differentiation media
without antibiotics at 5 pulses, 80V, 50 ms duration, 1 sec interval. For rescue experiments,
GFP expression plasmid and the CDK5RAP2 construct were coelectroporated at equal
concentrations (1ug/ul each).
Live imaging in organoids
Live imaging was performed using a LSM780 confocal laser scanning system (Zeiss)
equipped with temperature and CO2 control. For calcium imaging, Fluo-4 direct (Life
Technologies) was prepared according to manufacturer and applied 60 min before the start
of imaging. Imaging was performed at 494nm excitation and 516nm emission, frames taken
every 20 sec for 100 frames. Data analysis of calcium imaging was performed using ImageJ
(Fiji). Regions of interest (ROIs) were manually selected and mean fluorescence was
calculated for each time frame. Change is fluorescence was calculated as follows: F/F=(F￾Fbasal))/Fbackground where Fbasal was the lowest mean fluorescence value across imaging
while Fbackground was the average mean fluorescence across all frames. Glutamate was
added by bath application to media during imaging at a final concentration 100uM. TTX
was added by bath application to media during imaging at a final concentration of 1uM and
imaging was resumed after a 10min incubation time.
Histology and immunofluorescence
Tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at 4C followed by washing in PBS 3
times 10 min. Tissues were allowed to sink in 30% sucrose overnight and then embedded in
10%/7.5% gelatin/sucrose and cryosectioning at 20 μm. Tissue sections were stained with

Cell culture and western blot
HEK293T cells were grown in 10% FBS/DMEM and split at 40% into a 6-well dish (BD
Falcon) followed by transfection the next day using TurboFect (Thermo Scientific) with 5ug
plasmid DNA. Cells were lysed 2 days later and western blot was performed using rabbit
anti-CDK5RAP2 (A300-554A, Bethyl labs, 1:10,000) followed by blotting for mouse anti￾alpha tubulin (mouse, Sigma T6199, 1:10,000). Dermal fibroblasts were obtained by skin
punch biopsy and were cultured in amnioMAX C-100 complete medium (Invitrogen) and
maintained in a 37°C incubator with 5% CO2 and 3% O2. Cells were lysed in 50 mM Tris￾HCl pH 8, 280 mM NaCl, 0.5% NP40, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.2 mM EGTA, 10% Glycerol
supplemented with protease inhibitor tablet (Roche). Protein samples were run on a 3-8 %
Tris-acetate gel (Invitrogen) followed by immunoblotting using rabbit anti-CDK5RAP2
(A300-554A, Bethyl labs, 1:2,000) and mouse anti-vinculin (V9264, Sigma, 1:2,000). To
perform immunofluorescence, patient fibroblasts were fixed in −20°C methanol for 7 min

and then blocked in PBS/1 % bovine serum albumin. Cells were then incubated in rabbit
anti-CDK5RAP2 (A300-554A, Bethyl labs, 1:2,000) and mouse anti-CPAP (SC-81432,
Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:100) in blocking solution. Secondary antibodies used were
donkey AlexaFluor 488 and 568 conjugates (Invitrogen, 1:500).
Research subject and gene identification
Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood of Patient 3842 and the patient’s parents
by standard methods. Informed consent was obtained from the family and the study
approved by the Multi-centre Research Ethics Committee for Scotland (04:MRE00/19).
Whole exome capture and sequencing was performed at the Welcome Trust Sanger Institute
(WTSI), UK. DNA was sheared to 150bp lengths by sonification (Covaris, Woburn,
Massachusetts, USA) prior to whole exome capture and amplification using the SureSelect
Human All Exon 50Mb kit (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). Fragments were sequenced using the
Illumina Hiseq platform. 76bp paired end sequence reads were aligned to the UCSC genome
browser hg19 reference sequence using BWA. Sequence variants were obtained using
GenomeAnalysisTK (www.broadinstitute.org/gatk/) and annotated with transcript and
protein consequence, polyphen, condel and SIFT scores. Mutations were confirmed by bi￾directional sequencing of PCR products using dye terminator chemistry on an ABI 3730
capillary sequencer (Applied Biosystems).
Patient iPSC reprogramming
Patient skin fibroblasts were reprogrammed using lentiviral delivery of Oct4, Sox2, Klf4,
and c-Myc. Lentivirus production: A DNA mix consisting of virus packaging vectors (tat,
rev, gag/pol, 1.5ug each, and vsv-g, 3ug) and the loxP flanked OKSM reprogramming
vector (oct-4, klf4, sox2, c-myc, 30ug) were transfected into 293 cells. In brief, 112.5μl
Fugene6 was added dropwise to 2ml DMEM under constant vortexing followed by a 10min
incubation at RT. The DNA mix was added to the DMEM/Fugene6 mix while vortexing to
generate the final transfection mix. After a 15min incubation at RT, the transfection mix was
added onto 80% confluent 293 cells, cultured in 13ml 293 culture medium. Virus-containing
medium was harvested and replaced with fresh medium 48h, 60h and 72h after transfection.
The viral supernatant was stored at 4°C. Reprogramming of human dermal fibroblasts: 1×
105
 dermal fibroblasts were seeded the day before infection onto 10cm and 6cm 0.1%
Gelatin-coated culture dishes. Cells were incubated for 12h with viral supernatant 1:1 mixed
with dermal fibroblast medium supplemented with 4μg/ml polybrene. Thereafter, cells were
washed with 1x PBS and cultured for 2 more days in dermal fibroblast medium. After 2 days
medium was switched to human iPSCs medium supplemented with 10ng/ml bFGF
(peprotech, cat.nr: 100-18B), 10μM CHIR99021 (stemgent, cat.nr: 04-0004) and 1μM PD
0325901 (stemgent, cat.nr: 04-0006) and cells cultured for 21 days. Medium was changed
every day. Outgrowing colonies, identified by morphological appearance, were picked and
passaged on inactivated CF-1 MEFs (global stem, cat.nr: GSC-6201M). Patient derived iPS
lines were compared to control iPS cells obtained from a healthy donor (System
Biosciences, SC101A-1). Alkaline phosphatase staining was performed using Vector Blue
Alkaline Phosphatase Substrate Kit (Vector Laboratories, SK5300). Quantifications in
patient and control iPSC derived organoids were performed blinded using coded file names
in ImageJ.

Patient clinical synopsis
Patient A3842 exhibited growth restriction from fetal life, with marked reduction in brain
size evident at 22/40 weeks gestation. Pregnancy progressed otherwise normally and the
patient was born at term weighing 1.82kg (−3.9 s.d.). Postnatally, growth was also reduced
Lancaster et al. Page 11

such that height at 3 years 7 months was 73 cm ( −6.7 s.d.), and head circumference 35cm
(−13.2 s.d.), in keeping with a severe disproportionate microcephaly. The patient had quite
prominent eyes and conical shaped wide-space teeth, but was otherwise unremarkable on
examination. No neurological deficits or malformations in other systems were evident, aside
from a mixed conductive/sensorineural hearing loss. Development milestones were mildly/
moderately delayed. Neuroimaging at 22/40 gestation demonstrated a smooth brain (the
Sylvian fissure normally evident at this gestation was not present) with small frontal lobes
and partial absence of the corpus callosum. Postnatally, MRI demonstrated microcephaly
with a simplified gyral pattern and a cerebral cortex of normal thickness. In summary,
clinical findings were in keeping with previous cases of CDK5RAP2 primary microcephaly
(deafness has been previously reported with CDK5RAP245,46), with growth parameters
falling on the primary microcephaly-microcephalic primordial dwarfism spectrum reported
for other centrosomal microcephaly genes such as CENPJ and CEP152
