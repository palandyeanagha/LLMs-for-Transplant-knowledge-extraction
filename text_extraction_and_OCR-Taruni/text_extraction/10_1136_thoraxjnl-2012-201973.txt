Abstract
We present a case of a 32-year-old woman who was diagnosed with
lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) after detecting a mass in the
upper anterior mediastinum. Two years after presentation another
metastatic localisation of LAM occurred in the cervical region. With
this article we would like to highlight the fact that there are still a
lot of unanswered questions, especially regarding the best
management of extrapulmonary LAM.
