INTRODUCTION
Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a
devastating disease characterized by a
sustained increase in pulmonary arterial
pressure. This increase in pressure is pri￾marily due to vasoconstriction and re￾modeling of small pulmonary arteries,
resulting in increased pulmonary vascu￾lar resistance, right ventricular failure
and ultimately death. PH can be idio￾pathic, familial, associated with connec￾tive tissue disease or a result of drug or
toxin exposure (1). Patients with these
various forms of PH exhibit similar clini￾cal, functional and hemodynamic charac￾teristics and poor survival (2–5).
Recently, the development of therapies
for the management of PH has focused
on promoting vasodilation (6). While use
of drugs promoting vasodilation leads to
improvements in functional capacity and
modest decreases in pulmonary artery
pressure, recent metaanalysis of con￾trolled trials using these agents demon￾strated only limited benefit in terms of
mortality (7,8).
One significant barrier to the treat￾ment of PH is the relative lack of under￾standing of the role of immune mecha￾nisms in the development and
progression of the disease. Over the past
decade, a new class of proinflammatory
molecules, termed damage-associated
molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs),
has emerged as important inflammatory
mediators (9). DAMPs are endogenous
molecules, ranging from proteins to
small molecules, that are actively se￾creted or passively released by damaged
cells. Once in the extracellular milieu,
DAMPs promote inflammation and tis￾sue repair.

Survival rates for patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH) remain low, and our understanding of the mechanisms involved are
incomplete. Here we show in a mouse model of chronic hypoxia (CH)-induced PH that the nuclear protein and damage￾associate molecular pattern molecule (DAMP) high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) contributes to PH via a Toll-like receptor 4
(TLR4)-dependent mechanism. We demonstrate extranuclear HMGB1 in pulmonary vascular lesions and increased serum HMGB1
in patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension. The increase in circulating HMGB1 correlated with mean pulmonary
artery pressure. In mice, we similarly detected the translocation and release of HMGB1 after exposure to CH. HMGB1-neutralizing
antibody attenuated the development of CH-induced PH, as assessed by measurement of right ventricular systolic pressure, right
ventricular hypertrophy, pulmonary vascular remodeling and endothelial activation and inflammation. Genetic deletion of the
pattern recognition receptor TLR4, but not the receptor for advanced glycation end products, likewise attenuated CH-induced
PH. Finally, daily treatment of mice with recombinant human HMGB1 exacerbated CH-induced PH in wild-type (WT) but not Tlr4–/–
mice. These data demonstrate that HMGB1-mediated activation of TLR4 promotes experimental PH and identify HMGB1 and/or
TLR4 as potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of PH.

High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1)
is a prototypical and highly conserved
DAMP. Under normal conditions,
HMGB1 is a nuclear protein, where it
functions to stabilize nucleosomes (10).
However, on release into the extracellu￾lar environment, HMGB1 acts as a pro -
inflammatory cytokine by activating
 pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), in￾cluding Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and
the receptor for advanced glycation end
products (RAGE) (11–13). Evidence sug￾gests that in response to persistent tissue
injury, HMGB1, via activation of PRRs,
acts as a key initiating molecule of innate
immunity, orchestrating inflammation,
stem cell recruitment/activation and tis￾sue remodeling (13). Herein, we exam￾ined the role of HMGB1, TLR4 and
RAGE in the development of chronic hy￾poxia (CH)-induced PH in mice.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Human Subjects
Human tissue was obtained in compli￾ance with University of Pittsburgh and
Cleveland Clinic Institutional Review
Board guidelines.
Animal Use
All animal procedures were carried
out in accordance with the guidelines set
by the University of Pittsburgh Institu￾tional Animal Care and Use Committee
(IACUC) and with IACUC approval.
Mice
C57BL/6J mice were purchased from
The Jackson Laboratory. Tlr4–/– mice and
Rage–/– mice were generated on a
C57BL/6J background as previously de￾scribed (14,15). Age-matched 8- to 12-wk￾old male mice were used for the studies.
Cell Culture
Human pulmonary artery endothelial
cells (HPAECs), human pulmonary ar￾tery smooth muscle cells (HPASMCs)
and cell media were from Lonza. For
experiments, HPAECs were serum￾starved overnight, and HPASMCs were
serum-starved for 24 h in minimal
media. Cells were used between pas￾sage 4 and 9.
Materials
Mouse anti-human TLR4 neutralizing
antibody and nonimmune mouse IgG
were from eBioscience (San Diego, CA,
USA). Polyclonal antibody against
HMGB1 (provided by Kevin Tracey,
North Shore–Long Island Jewish Health
System, Feinstein Institute for Medical
Research) was prepared as described pre￾viously (16). Neutralizing activity of anti￾HMGB1 was confirmed in HMGB1-
 stimulated macrophage cultures by assay
of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) release. In
the presence of anti-HMGB1 antibody,
neutralizing antibody was defined as in￾hibiting >80% of HMGB1- induced TNF
release. Nonimmune rabbit IgG was pur￾chased from Sigma-Aldrich. For Western
blots, antibody against HMGB1 (#3935)
was from Cell Signaling Technology
(Danvers, MA, USA).
HMGB1 Isolation and Purification
The His-tagged full-length cDNA for
human HMGB1 subcloned into the secre￾tion signal of the FLAG expression vec￾tor YEpFLAG (Sigma) was transformed
into the protease-deficient yeast strain
BJ3505. The yeast was propagated, and
HIS-tagged HMGB1 was purified as
 previously described (17). After purifica￾tion, the protein was dialyzed versus
25 mmol/L Tris, 150 mmol/L KCl (pH
8.0), aliquoted and snap frozen at –80°C.
Hypoxic Exposure and Physiologic
Measurements
Mice were exposed to CH (10% O2) for
the indicated times, with normoxic mice
serving as control. Right ventricular sys￾tolic pressure (RVSP) was measured es￾sentially as described (18). Briefly, mice
were anesthetized with sodium pento￾barbital (60 mg/kg intraperitoneally [IP])
and ventilated via tracheotomy with
room air (175 breaths per minute, 175 μL
tidal volume). Body temperature was
monitored and regulated with a rectal
probe and heating pad. RVSP was deter￾mined by placing a 1 F solid-state pres￾sure transducing catheter (Millar Instru￾ments, Houston, TX, USA) directly into
the right ventricle (RV). Data were ac￾quired by using a PowerLab data
 acquisition system and LabChart Pro
software (AD Instruments). Blood was
collected via cardiac puncture. Broncho -
alveolar lavage (BAL) was obtained by
washing the lung via the trachea three
times with 0.5 mL phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS). The vasculature was
flushed with PBS, the heart was excised
and right heart hypertrophy was deter￾mined by the ratio of the weight of the
RV to the left ventricle (LV) plus septum
(Fulton index). The right lung was tied
off, dissected and flash frozen, and the
left lung was perfused with parafor -
maldehyde (4%) for embedding into
paraffin.
Immunohistochemistry
Paraffin-embedded lung sections
(5 μm) were baked 60 min at 55°C, de￾paraffinized in xylenes and rehydrated
through decreasing alcohol concentra￾tions (three xylenes, 2× 100%, 1× 95%,
1× 90%, 1× 70% ethanol, 1× PBS, for
3 min each) followed by antigen retrieval
citrate buffer by using a microwave.
Smooth muscle α-actin staining was per￾formed as described (18). For immuno￾fluorescent staining, sections were
blocked in 2% bovine serum albumin
after antigen retrieval and then incu￾bated in anti-HMGB1 antibody over -
night, followed by incubation for 60 min
with a secondary antibody (Cy3). Nuclei
were counterstained with Hoechst dye.
Images were taken by using an Olympus
Fluoview 1000 confocal microscope in
the Center for Biological Imaging at the
University of Pittsburgh.
Assessment of Pulmonary Vascular
Remodeling
Pulmonary vascular remodeling was
assessed by counting the number of par￾tially and fully muscularized peripheral
arterioles (35–100 mm) per high-power
field (200× total magnification). For each
mouse, at least 20 high-power fields were
analyzed in multiple lung sections. Wall

HMGB1 PROMOTES EXPERIMENTAL PH

thickness of muscularized vessels was
determined by measuring the thickness
at four points on pulmonary arterioles by
using the Java-based image-processing
program ImageJ (National Institutes of
Health, Bethesda, MD, USA).
Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay
The mouse endothelin 1 (ET-1) and
mouse soluble intracellular adhesion
molecule 1 (sICAM) enzyme-linked im￾munosorbent assays (ELISAs) were from
R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA)
and were performed according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The human
HMGB1 ELISA was from IBL Interna￾tional (Hamburg, Germany) and was
performed according to the manufac￾turer’s instructions.
Western Blot
Lung homogenate, serum or BAL
(BAL was centrifuged before loading to
remove contaminating cells) was sepa￾rated by sodium dodecyl sulfate–
 polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS￾PAGE) and transferred to nitrocellulose
membranes. Membranes were blocked in
Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20
(TBST), and 5% nonfat dry milk for
30 min, followed by incubation in pri￾mary antibody overnight. Membranes
were washed in TBST before incubation
for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase–
 conjugated secondary antibodies. Mem￾branes were washed and developed by
using enhanced chemiluminescence sub￾strate (Pierce).
Cell Proliferation
Proliferation of HPASMCs was deter￾mined by measuring [3
H] incorporation
as previously described (18). Briefly, cells
were serum-starved for 24 h in 12-well
plates and treated with either 1 μg/mL
recombinant human HMGB1 with or
without platelet-derived growth factor
(PDGF) (10 ng/mL, Sigma P4056) for
24 h. During the last 16 h, 0.2 μCi
[
3
H]thymidine was added. After the in￾cubation period, cells were washed twice
with ice-cold PBS, and 1 mL ice-cold 10%
trichloroacetic acid (Sigma T0699) was
added to each well for a 30-min incuba￾tion at 4°C, after which each well was
washed with 1 mL ice-cold 10% trichloro -
acetic acid. To each well, 0.5 mL of 0.4 N
NaOH, 0.1% (wt/vol) SDS, was added,
and the plates were incubated for 1 h at
room temperature. The contents of each
well were then transferred to 7-mL scin￾tillation vials containing 4.5 mL Pico￾Fluor-15 scintillation mixture (ICN [now
MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, CA, USA])
and counted in a liquid scintillation
 spectrometer.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were performed by
using Graphpad Prism software. For
human data, idiopathic pulmonary arte￾rial hypertension (IPAH) versus control
patient data were analyzed by Student
t test with Welch correction. HMGB1 lev￾els were correlated to mean pulmonary
artery pressure by the method of Pear￾son. For mice, data were analyzed by
one-way analysis of variance and Bonfer￾roni post hoc tests. P values of <0.05
were considered significant.

RESULTS
HMGB1 Release in Human and
Experimental PH
To identify a role for HMGB1 in PH,
we initially sought to determine whether
HMGB1 is mobilized from the nucleus to
the extracellular milieu, where it can act
as a DAMP. We examined the localiza￾tion of HMGB1 in the pulmonary arteries
of IPAH patients receiving lung trans￾plants (n = 3) or pulmonary arteries from
failed donor lungs (control, non-PH). In
pulmonary arteries from IPAH patients,
we observed extranuclear HMGB1 in
concentric and plexiform vascular le￾sions, whereas HMGB1 showed strict nu￾clear localization in pulmonary arteries
of non-PH patients (Figure 1A). An in￾crease in circulating HMGB1 was shown
in several inflammatory conditions
(19–26). We, therefore, measured serum
HMGB1 in IPAH patients versus healthy
controls. The mean serum HMGB1 con￾RESEARCH ARTICLE

centration in the serum of IPAH patients
was nearly sixfold higher than in healthy
controls (33.6 versus 5.7 ng/mL HMGB1)
(Figure 1B). In addition, we found that in
the 16 patients for whom we had hemo￾dynamic data available, circulating
HMGB1 levels correlated with mean pul￾monary artery pressures (Figure 1C).
Characteristics of the patient population
can be found in Table 1.
Likewise, by using the mouse model of
CH-induced PH (constant exposure to
10% O2), we were able to demonstrate
translocation of HMGB1 from the nucleus
to the extracellular milieu. In pulmonary
arteries from normoxic C57BL/6J mice,
HMGB1 was localized to the nucleus.
Within 48 h of exposure to hypoxia, we
observed translocation of HMGB1 to ex￾tranuclear locations (Figure 2A). The
translocation of HMGB1 to extranuclear
compartments was associated with in￾creased HMGB1 in the serum (Figure 2B)
and BAL fluid (Figure 2C), demonstrat￾ing that HMGB1 is released into the ex￾tracellular milieu in response to hypoxia.
In addition, we detected an overall in￾crease in HMGB1 expression in lung ho￾mogenate in response to CH (Figure 2D).
HMGB1 Neutralizing Antibody
Attenuates Experimental PH
To study the hemodynamic impact of
extracellular HMGB1 in CH-induced PH,
we treated C57BL/6J mice exposed to
3 wks of CH with an HMGB1-
 neutralizing antibody (αHMGB1) or con￾trol IgG (50 μg every other day). Un￾treated normoxic and CH mice served as
the baseline for non-PH and CH-induced
PH, respectively. As expected, CH in￾duced an increase in RVSP and right
ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) in un￾treated mice. Supporting the hypothesis
that extracellular HMGB1 contributes to
the pathogenesis of PH, treatment of
mice with αHMGB1 significantly attenu￾ated the increase in RVSP and RVH in re￾sponse to CH (Figures 3A, B). Treatment
of mice with nonspecific IgG had no ef￾fect on the course of CH-induced PH,
demonstrating the specificity of the
αHMGB1 antibody.
We then investigated the effect of CH
on vascular remodeling in these mice by
assessing the degree of muscularization
of peripheral pulmonary arteries. In￾creased muscularization was observed in
the CH wild-type (WT) mice, as reflected
by enhanced immunoreactivity for
α-smooth muscle cell actin (SMA). Treat￾ment with αHMGB1, but not control IgG,
attenuated pulmonary vascular remodel￾ing. Figures 4A–C show representative
photomicrographs of SMA-stained lung
sections from hypoxic WT mice and hy￾poxic WT mice treated with control IgG
or αHMGB1, respectively. Morphometric
analysis reveals that treating mice with
αHMGB1 had no effect on the number
of partially muscularized arterioles (Fig￾ure 4D), but led to a decreased number
of fully muscularized arterioles

(<150 μmol/L) (Figure 4E) as well as
 decreased vessel wall thickness (Fig￾ure 4F) when compared with untreated
or IgG-treated CH mice. In vitro experi￾ments reveal that HMGB1 had no effect
on human pulmonary artery smooth
muscle cell proliferation, suggesting that
the effects of HMGB1 on vascular remod￾eling were indirect (Figure 4G).
Endothelial dysfunction and inflam￾mation contributes to the development
of PH by promoting vasoconstriction
and pulmonary vascular remodeling.
Several markers of endothelial dysfunc￾tion and inflammation are increased in
human and experimental PH, including
intracellular adhesion molecule 1
(ICAM-1) and ET-1 (27,28), and drugs
that target ET-1 receptors are used to
treat PH (29). We observed increased
lung ICAM-1 and plasma ET-1 in un￾treated or IgG-treated mice exposed to
CH. In CH mice treated with αHMGB1
antibody, the increase in ICAM-1 and
ET-1 was abrogated (Figures 5A, B), sug￾gesting that HMGB1 contributes to en￾dothelial dysfunction and inflammation
in PH.
TLR4 Contributes to the Pathogenesis
of PH
HMGB1 is known to bind to and acti￾vate both TLR4 and RAGE. There are no
data on the role of RAGE in PH, whereas
a recent study demonstrated that mice
expressing mutant TLR4 (C3H/HEJ
mice) are protected from PH. We first ex￾amined whether TLR4 or RAGE is up￾regulated in response to CH. RNA iso￾lated from the lungs of age-matched
male C57BL/6J mice exposed to nor￾moxia or 3 wks of CH was reverse-
 transcribed, and RAGE or TLR4 message
was assessed by quantitative polymerase
chain reaction (Figure 6A). TLR4 expres￾sion was approximately threefold higher
in the lungs of CH mice compared with
normoxic mice. RAGE expression was
nearly twofold greater; however, the dif￾ference was not statistically significant.
To confirm a role for these receptors in
the development of PH, WT (C57BL/6J),
Rage–/– and Tlr4–/– mice were exposed to
CH for 3 wks. Age-matched mice kept in
room air served as controls. The loss of
TLR4, but not RAGE, significantly atten￾RESEARCH ARTICLE

uated the development of PH in hypoxic
Tlr4–/– mice when compared with hy￾poxic WT mice as determined by mea￾surement of RVSP (Figure 6B). On the
other hand, both hypoxic Rage–/– mice
and hypoxic Tlr4–/– mice had decreased
RV hypertrophy when compared with
WT hypoxic mice (Figure 6C).
SMA staining of lung sections from
WT mice revealed an increase in muscu￾larization of arterioles (<150 μmol/L) in
hypoxic versus normoxic WT mice.
There were significantly less partially
and fully muscularized arterioles in the
lungs of Tlr4–/– hypoxic versus WT hy￾poxic mice (Figures 6D, E). In contrast,
we observed no difference in partially
muscularized vessels in hypoxic Rage–/–
versus hypoxic WT mice. The number of
fully muscularized vessels in Rage–/–
mice tended to be fewer when compared
to WT mice, but the difference did not
reach statistical significance. Vessel wall
thickness was also increased in WT mice
in response to CH, and there was no dif￾ference between WT and Rage–/– mice.
When compared with WT mice, how￾ever, there was significantly less thicken￾ing of pulmonary arterioles in Tlr4–/–
mice (Figure 6F). Similarly, genetic dele￾tion of TLR4, but not RAGE, abrogated
CH-induced increases in ET-1 and
sICAM-1 (Figures 6G, H). These data
suggest an important role for TLR4, but
not RAGE, in the development of PH.
Exogenous HMGB1 Exacerbates 
CH-Induced PH in a TLR4-Dependent
Manner
On the basis of our results demonstrat￾ing a role for HMGB1 and TLR4 in the
development of PH, we next tested
whether the effect of HMGB1 in PH is
TLR4 dependent. WT or Tlr4–/– mice
were exposed to CH for 10 d with or
without daily injections of recombinant
human HMGB1 (10 μg/d IP). In nor￾moxia, HMGB1 had no effect on RVSP,
RVH or pulmonary vascular remodeling
in WT or Tlr4–/– mice (Supplementary
Figures S1A–E). Ten-day CH caused a
statistically significant increase in RVSP in
WT mice (19.9 ± 2.8 mmHg in normoxia
versus 27.4 ± 2.2 mmHg in hypoxia) but
not Tlr4–/– mice (22.4 ± 1.3 mmHg in nor￾moxia versus 26.4 ± 1.7 mmHg in hy￾poxia). Similarly, RVH, as measured by
Fulton index [RV/(LV + S)], was in￾creased in WT mice (0.259 ± 0.021 in nor￾moxia versus 0.303 ± 0.013 in hypoxia)
but not Tlr4–/– mice (0.260 ± 0.020 in nor￾moxia versus 0.287 ± 0.025 in hypoxia).
Treatment of WT mice, but not Tlr4–/–
mice, with HMGB1 exacerbated CH-in￾duced increases in RVSP and RVH (Fig￾ures 7A, B). Likewise, pulmonary vascu￾lar remodeling worsened in WT mice
treated with HMGB1, whereas Tlr4–/–

mice were unaffected (Figures 7C–E).
HMGB1 treatment of hypoxic WT mice
also increased plasma ET-1 levels over
hypoxia alone without affecting sICAM
levels (Figure 8A). HMGB1 had no effect
on ET-1 or sICAM in Tlr4–/– mice (Figure
8B). Finally, treatment of human pul￾monary artery endothelial cells with
HMGB1 resulted in a significant increase
in ET-1 released into the cell culture
media, as determined by ELISA (Figure
8C). The effect of HMGB1 on ET-1 re￾lease in HPAECs was abrogated by a
TLR4-neutralizing antibody demonstrat￾ing that the effect was mediated by
TLR4. Taken together, these data demon￾strate that HMGB1 promotes experimen￾tal PH via TLR4.
DISCUSSION
PH is classically described as a disease
of endothelial dysfunction involving pul￾monary vasoconstriction and pulmonary
vascular remodeling, leading to increased
pulmonary vascular resistance. However,
clinical data demonstrate that despite ad￾vances in therapeutics aimed at promot￾ing pulmonary vasodilation, survival re￾mains poor (30). These data highlight the
necessity of novel approaches to treating
PH. There is mounting evidence of a role
for the immune system in the pathogene￾sis of PH. A role for inflammation in
human PH is based on the identification
of inflammatory cells in vascular lesions
of PH patients (31), elevated circulating
levels of inflammatory cytokines in PH
patients (32) and case studies in PH pa￾tients demonstrating improvement with
antiinflammatory drugs (33,34). In the
mouse model of CH-induced PH, there is
an influx of inflammatory cells within the
first 48 h that diminishes by 2 wks. This
increase in inflammatory cells coincides
with increased secretion of proinflamma￾tory cytokines, including TNFα, inter￾leukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and MCP-1 (35). In
addition, IL-6 overexpression promotes,
and genetic deletion of IL-6 attenuates,
PH in this model (36,37).
A key facet of the innate immune re￾sponse is self-/nonself recognition.
Through the use of PRRs, the innate im￾mune system is capable of detecting con￾served pathogen motifs, termed patho￾gen-associated molecular patterns
(PAMPs), thereby stimulating an im￾mune response (38). In recent years,
however, it was acknowledged that the
self-/nonself paradigm fails to explain
innate immune activation in diseases in￾volving sterile inflammation (39). The

discovery of DAMPs, which have a simi￾lar function to PAMPs, has provided a
context for understanding innate im￾mune activation in the absence of foreign
pathogens (9). HMGB1 fulfills the func￾tions of a DAMP, being involved in in￾flammation caused by both infectious
and noninfectious stimuli (40). Once re￾leased, HMGB1 signals through various
PRRs to activate immune and paren -
chymal cells involved in the immune
 process (11–13).
Our studies clearly establish a role for
extracellular HMGB1 in the pathogenesis
of CH-induced PH in mice. In particular,
data showing translocation of HMGB1
into the extracellular milieu and that
HMGB1-neutralizing antibody attenuates
CH-induced PH show the necessity of
extracellular HMGB1 to fully develop the
disease. HMGB1 may have additional in￾tracellular roles in PH; however, the
strategies used in this study likely do not
address these roles. The clinical rele￾vance of these data is indicated by the
observations that (a) there is a diffuse ex￾tranuclear staining pattern of HMGB1 in
pulmonary vascular lesions of PH pa￾tients and (b) there is increased circulat￾ing HMGB1 in PH patients, which corre￾lates with mean pulmonary arterial
pressure.
In addition to our findings in mice and
humans, it was also reported, in the form
of an a published abstract, that there is
increased circulating HMGB1 in
monocrotaline rats and that HMGB1 is
released from smooth muscle cells and
alveolar macrophages in this model (41).
The consistency of this phenomenon (in￾creased circulating HMGB1) across mice,
rats and humans suggests that HMGB1
is an important mediator of PH across
species. Future studies using similar
strategies (that is, HMGB1-neutralizing
antibodies) in other experimental PH
models, such as monocrotaline and the
SU5416/hypoxia model in rats, will be
important to support this hypothesis.
A role for HMGB1-TLR4 interaction in
driving immunopathology was initially
described in 2005. In that study, it was
found that an HMGB1-neutralizing anti￾body protects WT mice (C3H/HeouJ)
but not Tlr4–/– mice (C3H/HEJ) from
liver ischemia reperfusion injury (42).
Since then, several studies have demon￾strated a role for HMGB1–TLR4 interac￾tions in the immunopathology of dis￾eases, including inflammation- induced
seizures (43), inflammation- induced skin
cancer (44), end organ injury after tissue
trauma (45) and ischemic kidney injury
(46). Our study establishes a role for
HMGB1 and TLR4 interaction in the
pathogenesis of PH. Genetic deletion of
TLR4 attenuated CH-induced PH, as as￾sessed by measuring RVSP, RVH and
pulmonary vascular remodeling. Fur￾thermore, exogenous HMGB1 exacer￾bated CH-induced PH in WT but not
Tlr4–/– mice, establishing a link between
HMGB1 and TLR4 in PH. Consistent
with a role for HMGB1 and TLR4 in en￾dothelial activation and inflammation,
HMGB1 neutralizing antibody or loss of
TLR4 also prevented hypoxia-induced
increases in endothelin-1 and soluble
ICAM-1. Interestingly, however, treating
mice with exogenous HMGB1 during hy￾poxia exacerbated the increase in ET-1
but not sICAM-1 in WT mice. This result
suggests that HMGB1 may directly con￾tribute to the elevation of ET-1 in PH. In￾deed, human pulmonary artery endothe￾lial cells treated with HMGB1 secreted
more ET-1 than untreated cells, which
was attenuated by TLR4-neutralizing an￾tibody. TLR4 agonists have also been
shown to induce production of ET-1 by
dendritic cells (47). The effect of the
HMGB1-neutralizing antibody or genetic
deletion of TLR4 on sICAM levels would
appear to be indirect, since exogenous
HMGB1 did not further increase sICAM.
Alternatively, it is possible that sICAM
expression is maximally induced by en￾dogenous HMGB1 and cannot be further
induced by addition of the exogenous
protein.
In addition to its effects on ET-1 and
ICAM-1 expression, recent data from our
laboratory demonstrate that HMGB1 is a
potent inhibitor of endothelial cell migra￾tion, suggesting one mechanism may be
the inhibition of endothelial repair mech￾anisms (17). In addition, in that study,
we show that hypoxia induces the re￾lease of HMGB1 from endothelial cells,
suggesting that endothelial cells could be
one source of increased circulating
HMGB1 in PH. The HMGB1/TLR4 sig￾naling axis has been shown to stimulate
neutrophil NADPH oxidase (NOX2) in
both neutrophils and lung microvascular
endothelial cells, and NOX2 is thought to
be important in the pathogenesis of PH
(48). TLR4 is also expressed on multiple
other cell types important in the patho￾genesis of PH. HMGB1 induces macro￾phages to secrete proinflammatory cy￾tokines in a TLR4-dependent manner
(49). Studies also demonstrate that TLR4
is found on platelets and that activation
of platelet TLR4 promotes platelet aggre￾gation (50), which may promote in situ
thrombosis, a feature of human IPAH.
Future experiments using bone marrow
chimeric mice and tissue-specific knock￾outs will help reveal cell-specific mecha￾nisms by which TLR4/HMGB1 signaling
promotes PH.
We also explored the possibility that
RAGE contributes to the development of
CH-induced PH. RAGE is highly en￾riched in the lung (51,52) and has been
reported to be a important receptor for
HMGB1 (53–55). Interestingly Rage–/–
mice developed the same degree of PH
(as determined by RVSP) as WT mice
when exposed to CH, suggesting that
RAGE does not contribute to increased
pulmonary vascular resistance in CH-
 induced PH. This was corroborated by
data showing that CH induced a similar
degree of pulmonary vascular remodel￾ing in WT and Rage–/– mice. Despite
these observations, CH-induced RVH
was significantly attenuated in Rage–/–
mice when compared with WT mice.
These data suggest that RAGE is in￾volved in the hypertrophic response of
the right heart to increased pulmonary
arterial pressure. This result is consistent
with a previous study demonstrating a
role for RAGE in mediating cardiac hy￾pertrophy in mice fed a Western diet
(56). Whereas the attenuated RVH in
Rage–/– mice is an important observation,

experiments interrogating a role for
RAGE in RVH are beyond the scope of
the current study.
CONCLUSION
The data presented herein demonstrate
that HMGB1-mediated activation of
TLR4 promotes experimental PH and
identify HMGB1 and/or TLR4 as poten￾tial therapeutic targets for the treatment
of this devastating disease.
