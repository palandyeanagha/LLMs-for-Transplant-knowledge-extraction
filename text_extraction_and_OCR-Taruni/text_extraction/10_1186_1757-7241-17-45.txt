Abstract
Death due to trauma is the leading cause of lost life years worldwide, with haemorrhage being
responsible for 30-40% of trauma mortality and accounting for almost 50% of the deaths the initial
24 h. On admission, 25-35% of trauma patients present with coagulopathy, which is associated with
a several-fold increase in morbidity and mortality. The recent introduction of haemostatic control
resuscitation along with emerging understanding of acute post-traumatic coagulability, are
important means to improve therapy and outcome in exsanguinating trauma patients. This change
in therapy has emphasized the urgent need for adequate haemostatic assays to monitor traumatic
coagulopathy and guide therapy. Based on the cell-based model of haemostasis, there is emerging
consensus that plasma-based routine coagulation tests (RCoT), like prothrombin time (PT) and
activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), are inappropriate for monitoring coagulopathy and
guide therapy in trauma. The necessity to analyze whole blood to accurately identify relevant
coagulopathies, has led to a revival of the interest in viscoelastic haemostatic assays (VHA) such as
Thromboelastography (TEG®) and Rotation Thromboelastometry (ROTEM®). Clinical studies
including about 5000 surgical and/or trauma patients have reported on the benefit of using the VHA
as compared to plasma-based assays, to identify coagulopathy and guide therapy.
This article reviews the basic principles of VHA, the correlation between the VHA whole blood
clot formation in accordance with the cell-based model of haemostasis, the current use of VHA￾guided therapy in trauma and massive transfusion (haemostatic control resuscitation), limitations
of VHA and future perspectives of this assay in trauma.
Introduction
On admission, 25-35% of trauma patients present with
coagulopathy, which is associated with a several-fold
increase in morbidity and mortality [1,2]. Although the
management of traumatic coagulopathy differs world￾wide [3,4], the recent introduction of haemostatic control
resuscitation [5-7] and the emerging understanding of
acute post-traumatic coagulopathy [1,2,8,9], emphasize
the urgent need for adequate haemostatic assays to guide
therapy. Classically, coagulopathy is often monitored by
plasma-based routine coagulation tests (RCoT) such as
activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and pro￾thrombin time (PT). These assays were developed half a
century ago to monitor haemophilia and anticoagulation
therapy, but have unfortunately never been validated for
the prediction of haemorrhage in a clinical setting

[10,11]. It should be noted that although abnormal PT
and APTT are highly correlated with mortality in trauma
patients, the cause of death in these patients is not identi￾fied as excessive bleeding [12-14]. This lack of correlation
with clinically relevant coagulopathies can be explained
by the fact that plasma-based assays reflect only the small
amount of thrombin formed during initiation of coagula￾tion [15,16]. Consequently, recent reviews have con￾cluded that the plasma-based assays are inappropriate for
monitoring coagulopathy or guide transfusion therapy,
calling for new tests to monitor these complex patients
[17,18].
In 1994, the classical clotting cascade of haemostasis
[19,20] was challenged by the introduction of a cell-based
model of haemostasis emphasizing the importance of tis￾sue factor (TF) as the initiator of coagulation and the piv￾otal role of platelets for intact haemostasis [21]. The poor
correlation between RCoT and clinical bleeding in e.g.
trauma and surgery [12-15,22-25] is, hence, explained by
this new understanding of haemostasis.
The necessity to analyze whole blood to accurately iden￾tify relevant coagulopathies, has led to a revival of the
interest in viscoelastic point-of-care haemostatic assays
(VHA) such as Thromboelastography (TEG®) and Rota￾tion Thromboelastometry (ROTEM®).
The objective of this article is to review the basic principles
of VHA, the correlation between the result of VHA and
clot formation in accordance with the cell-based model of
haemostasis, the current use of VHA-guided therapy in
trauma and massive transfusion (haemostatic control
resuscitation), limitations of VHA and future perspectives
of application of this assay.
Basic principles of VHA
Thrombelastography was first described in 1948 by H.
Hartert [26], as a method to assess the viscoelastic proper￾ties of coagulation in whole blood under low shear condi￾tions [27-31]. The VHA gives a graphic presentation of clot
formation and subsequent lysis. Blood is incubated at
37°C in a heated cup. Within the cup is suspended a pin
connected to a detector system (a torsion wire in TEG and
an optical detector in ROTEM). The cup and pin are oscil￾lated relative to each other through an angle of 4° 45'. The
movement is initiated from either the cup (TEG) or the
pin (ROTEM). As fibrin forms between the cup and pin,
the transmitted rotation from the cup to pin (TEG) or the
impedance of the rotation of the pin (ROTEM) are
detected at the pin and a trace generated (Figure 1). The
trace is divided into parts that each reflects different stages
of the haemostatic process (clotting time, kinetics,
strength and lysis, Figure 1) with slightly different nomen￾clature for TEG and ROTEM (Table 1). Examples of traces
generated from normal as compared to different patho￾logical states are shown in Figure 2.
VHA can either be performed bedside using native non￾anticoagulated blood if the sample is analyzed within 5
min or it can be performed in a laboratory setting, where
citrated blood samples are employed [32]. The technical
stability of the VHA analysis is demonstrated by day-to￾day variation (CV%) of 5-15% for the different parame￾ters [32,33].
Compared to RCoT, VHA has several advantages. First, the
evaluation of the coagulation system in whole blood
allows assessment of the combined influence of circulat￾ing plasmatic and cellular (platelets, RBC, leukocytes) ele￾ments on clot formation, including platelet function.
Second, the end-point is clinically relevant, i.e. clotting in

whole blood (fibrin formation, clot retraction and fibri￾nolysis, Figure 2). Third, the results are available within a
short time frame making them relevant to clinical deci￾sion-making.
VHA and the cell-based model of haemostasis
According to the cell-based model, haemostasis is
described in three phases [34-36]: Initiation, amplification
and propagation. During initiation, circulating activated
coagulation factor (F) VII (FVIIa) forms a complex with
exposed TF on injured endothelium, which in the ampli￾fication stage generates a small amount of thrombin that
mainly activates the platelets. In the propagation phase the
coagulation factors assemble on the activated platelets
generating large amounts of thrombin ("thrombin
burst"). The rate and peak of thrombin generation influ￾ences the clot structure and stability [37], by activating
FXIII to FXIIIa, which cross links fibrinogen and further
stabilizes the clot [38]. Furthermore, thrombin activates
TAFI to TAFIa which prevents lysis of the fibrin clot [39].
The three different phases of cell-based haemostasis
resulting in clot formation are reflected by the VHA. The
structural changes in the clot along the VHA trace was
recently investigated by scanning electron microscopy
demonstrating that the R (TEG)/CT (ROTEM) corre￾sponds to the initiation phase whereas K (TEG)/CFT
(ROTEM) reflects the amplification phase [40]. Our group
and others have demonstrated that the thrombin burst is
reflected by the -angle (TEG/ROTEM), and determines
the clot strength and stability [41,42]. The ability of VHA
to reflect thrombin generation has profound clinical util￾ity because coagulation factor deficiencies secondary to
e.g. massive bleeding, dilution, consumption and throm￾bocytopenia/pathy result in impaired thrombin genera￾tion and impaired clot strength (MA (TEG), MCF
(ROTEM)) [30,43]. The whole blood based VHA, there￾fore, reveals the contribution of all circulating plasmatic
and cellular components, in their actual concentrations,
to clot formation [44]. Importantly, enhanced fibrinolysis
contributes significantly to bleeding in trauma patients as
well as patients undergoing cardiac and liver surgery and
patients with obstetric complications, and this condition
is readily identified by VHA (Ly (TEG), CL (ROTEM))
[45]. In addition, VHA in vitro studies have evaluated the
effects of hypothermia [46], acidosis [47], different crys￾talloids and colloids [48], pro-haemostatic [49] and anti￾fibrinolytic drugs [50], with results being highly relevant
for the clinical setting.
VHA in the surgical setting
In the last 25 years, more than 20 clinical studies reporting
on the benefit of using VHA when compared to RCoT to
identify coagulopathy and guide transfusion therapy have
been published (Table 2). The studies include three rand￾omized clinical trials and involve more than 4,500
patients undergoing major surgery. The majority of stud￾ies have been performed in patients undergoing liver or
cardiac surgery [51-57], all reporting of the benefit of
using VHA when compared to RCoT, evidenced by reduc￾tions in transfusion requirements and need for re-explora￾tion and improved ability to predict the need for blood
transfusion in patients with VHA-guided therapy. Impor￾tantly, no study have to date reported a benefit of employ￾ing plasma-based RCoT to predict bleeding or guide
transfusion therapy, when compared to VHA, supporting
the scientific rationale of whole blood viscoelastic assays
in this setting.
Massive transfusion
Our group reported the effect on mortality of guiding
transfusion therapy in massively bleeding patients (n =
832, 21% trauma patients) by VHA as compared to RCoT.
Patients treated according to the VHA results received
more FFP and more platelets and had significantly lower
30-day mortality as compared to controls (20% vs. 32%)
[58].
It is intriguing that the increased amount of plasma and
platelets administered based on the VHA results are asso￾Table 1: Nomenclature of TEG and ROTEM

ciated with improved survival, in alignment with retro￾spective findings from the trauma setting [59] as well as
the implementation of blind transfusion protocols [60].
VHA in trauma
A conserved physiologic haemostatic response, character￾ized by immediate activation of coagulation and fibrinol￾ysis followed by subsequent fibrinolytic shutdown and
later reactivation is often observed in trauma patients
[61]. Post-traumatic coagulopathy is classically described
as dysfunction and/or consumption of coagulation factors
and platelets due to dilution, hypothermia and acidosis
i.e., "the bloody viscious cycle" and the ability of VHA to
identify these conditions has been extensively reported
[22,23,58,62-70]. At present, 10 studies including more
than 700 patients have evaluated VHA in trauma patients
(Table 3).
Kaufmann et al. found that in 69 patients with blunt
trauma, 65% displayed hypercoagulability upon arrival at
the emergency department (ED) whereas only 10% were
hypocoagulable. Interestingly, a hypocoagulable TEG was
associated with increased ISS and only ISS and VHA, not
RCoT, was predictive for early transfusion [62]. Schreiber
and colleagues [63] also found that hypercoagulability, as
evaluated by VHA, was frequent (62%) in trauma patients
(n = 65) upon arrival at the ED, and that this correlated
with increased thrombin-antithrombin (TAT) complex
generation. APTT, PT and platelet count where within nor￾mal limits and could, hence, not identify a hypercoagula￾Table 2: Studies evaluating the effect of TEG vs. routine coagulation tests (RCoT) on haemostasis in surgical patients

ble state. Rugeri and colleagues [64] investigated 88
trauma patients and compared their VHA results with that
of healthy subjects. They found that trauma patients dem￾onstrated evidence of hypocoagulability, and that this was
restricted to those trauma patients also being coagulo￾pathic with RCoT.
Recently, Carroll and colleagues [65] addressed the acute
post-traumatic coagulopathy, reported by Brohi et al.,
[2,8,9] by VHA analyses of samples obtained at the scene
of accident and upon arrival in the ED in 161 trauma
patients. Interestingly, they found that that the clot form￾ing parameters demonstrated hypocoagulability and cor￾related with fatality, whereas none of the RCoT
demonstrated such a correlation. This indicates that VHA
is more sensitive in reflecting clinically relevant coagu￾lopathies than RCoT. This has important implications,
since the VHA result is available within a short time frame
as interventions aiming at normalising the VHA profile
and hence the coagulopathy, can be instituted early dur￾ing resuscitation. The VHA results of acute post-traumatic
coagulopathy presented by Carroll et al. do not, however,
corroborate the frequency of hyperfibrinolysis reported by
Brohi et al. [8]. Only three patients (2%) demonstrated
evidence of increased fibrinolysis compared to the hyper￾fibrinolysis described in the cohort of Brohi, using D￾dimer as a marker of fibrinolysis. Levrat and colleagues
[66] reported in a cohort of 89 trauma patients that 5
(6%) showed evidence of increased fibrinolysis and that
this correlated with euglobuline lysis time. In both the
study of Carroll et al. and Levrat et al., hyperfibrinolysis
was identified in the most severely injured patients and
was associated with increased mortality rate confirming
that although rare, this is a very serious condition. A
unique feature of VHA is its ability to identify patients
with increased fibrinolysis. This enables initiation of spe￾cific anti-fibrinolytic therapy, which is associated with
decreased blood loss and/or transfusion requirements in
non-trauma settings [71]. The role of this therapy in
trauma patients [72] is currently under clinical evaluation
http://www.crash2.lshtm.ac.uk/.
In a retrospective review of 44 combat patients with pen￾etrating trauma Plotkin et al. [23] reported that VHA was
a more accurate indicator of blood product requirements
than PT, APTT, and INR. They suggested that VHA aided
by platelet count and haematocrit should guide blood
transfusion requirements. This is in alignment with Mar￾tini and colleagues [22] who demonstrated that VHA was
superior than PT, APTT, and Activated Clotting Time in
detecting clinically relevant clotting abnormalities after
hypothermia, haemorrhagic shock and resuscitation in
pigs.
Recently Jaeger and colleagues [67] reported of a modifi￾cation of the VHA (TEG) where the activator kaolin was
substituted with TF (RapidTEG). In patients sustaining
major blunt trauma they investigated the time from ED
arrival to the results of standard TEG, RapidTEG and RCoT
were available. RapidTEG was available significantly faster
(19.2 min vs. 29.9 min for kaolin TEG and 34.1 min for
RCoT). On average the time until the results were availa￾ble was reduced by approximately 50% for RapidTEG as
compared to standard TEG, which may be of clinical rele￾vance.
VHA limitations
Important limitations of the VHA exist and should be
taken into consideration when interpreting the results of
the analysis. Firstly, though it is possible to adjust the tem￾Table 3: Studies evaluating VHA in trauma patients

perature at which the blood sample is analysed, VHA is
routinely performed at 37°C and therefore the effect of
hypothermia will not be recognised [73,74]. Secondly, the
coagulation activators employed results in thrombin for￾mation, which masks the possible inhibition that anti￾thrombotic agents such as aspirin, NSAID, clopidogrel
and eptifibatide may have on the platelets ability to aggre￾gate [75]. Consequently, a normal VHA profile does not
rule out clinically significant platelet inhibition. Thirdly,
the endothelial contribution to haemostasis is not dis￾played in VHA and therefore, conditions affecting the
endothelium such as von Willebrand disease (vWD,
quantitative or qualitative defects in vWF and, hence ina￾bility of the platelets to adhere to the endothelium), can￾not be investigated. If these causes of abnormal bleeding
can be excluded, then a normal VHA trace along with clin￾ically significant bleeding necessitating blood transfusion
is suspect of a surgical cause. Thus, our group found 97%
predictability by VHA in identifying a surgical cause of
bleeding in postoperative non-cardiac patients with ongo￾ing transfusion requirements [68].
VHA future perspectives in trauma
Recently, the concept of acute traumatic coagulopathy
(ATC) was introduced by Brohi et al. [2,8,9,13] based on
the observations that coagulopathy, as evaluated by
increased PT, APTT and D-dimer levels, was present in
trauma patients already upon arrival to the hospital. ATC
was independent of traditional causes of coagulopathy
but occurred only in patients with evident hypoperfusion.
When evaluating trauma patients upon arrival at ED with
VHA characteristic profiles are found that are related to ISS
and mortality. In patients with minor trauma/tissue injury
a normal VHA trace is seen (Figure 2A) whereas in patients
with moderate trauma (ISS between 10-20) hypercoagula￾bility is seen (Figure 2B). In patients with severe injury
(ISS 20-35), an increased frequency of hypocoagulability
is seen (Figure 2C) whereas patients with massive tissue
injury (ISS above 30) hyperfibrinolysis is seen (Figure
2D). The different VHA traces indicate that different treat￾ment strategies may be appropriate and this warrants fur￾ther investigation.
Conclusion
Death due to trauma is the leading cause of lost life years
worldwide, with haemorrhage being responsible for 30-
40% of trauma mortality and accounting for almost 50%
of the deaths the initial 24 h [5]. There is emerging con￾sensus that plasma-based assays are inappropriate for
monitoring coagulopathy and guide transfusion therapy
in trauma [17,18], and the cell-based model of haemosta￾sis [21,34-36] provides a reliable explanation for this
notion. Clinical studies including more than 5000 surgi￾cal and/or trauma patients have reported on the benefit of
using VHA when compared to RCoT to identify coagulop￾athy and guide transfusion therapy. However, at present
no VHA guided transfusion therapy has been prospec￾tively and independently validated in trauma patients,
which is highly warranted.
