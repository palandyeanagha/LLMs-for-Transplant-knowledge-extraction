Introduction
Acute lung injury (ALI) is a devastating syndrome with
an overall mortality rate of 30–40% (1). The syndrome
is characterized by flooding of alveolar spaces with a
protein-rich exudate that impairs pulmonary gas
exchange leading to arterial hypoxemia and respirato￾ry failure. Although this syndrome can follow lung
injury and inflammation from multiple causes (e.g.,
sepsis, pancreatitis, hemorrhagic shock, or toxic inhala￾tion), the molecular steps regulating the development
of alveolar flooding are poorly understood, and no spe￾cific pharmacologic therapies are currently available. In
mice, ALI can be modeled by administration of a single
dose of intratracheal bleomycin, a drug that can also
cause a similar syndrome in humans (2, 3).
The cytokine TGF-β plays a critical role in the reso￾lution of tissue injury in multiple organs, including
the lung (4). Following ALI, TGF-β has been most
thoroughly evaluated during the late phases of tissue
repair, where it plays a critical role in the development
of pulmonary fibrosis (5, 6). However, in a recent
study evaluating global patterns of gene expression
following bleomycin-induced lung injury, we found
that expression levels of several TGF-β–inducible
genes were dramatically increased as early as 2 days
after the induction of injury (7), a time point that pre￾cedes the maximal increase in alveolar flooding. Fur￾thermore, in patients the TGF-β–inducible gene, pro￾collagen III, is one of the earliest predictors of the
severity of ALI (8, 9). In vitro TGF-β has been shown
to directly increase the permeability of endothelial
monolayers (10). We therefore reasoned that TGF-β
might be active early in ALI and could potentially con￾tribute to the development of the pulmonary edema
that characterizes this disorder.
As a first step to assess the possible role of TGF-β in
ALI, we compared the increases in lung permeability
after treatment with intratracheal bleomycin in wild￾type mice and in mice lacking the epithelial integrin
αvβ6, an integrin that we have shown plays a critical
role in activation of latent TGF-β in the lungs and
skin (11). Wild-type mice developed a significant
increase in lung permeability to water and protein
after bleomycin, but there was no significant change
in either index of pulmonary edema in mice deficient
in the αvβ6 integrin. To more directly assess the role
of TGF-β in this process, we administered a soluble
TGF-β inhibitor (a TGF-β type II receptor–IgG-Fc
chimera) to wild-type mice treated with bleomycin or
Escherichia coli endotoxin. Administration of this solu￾ble receptor has been shown previously to inhibit sev￾eral TGF-β−mediated responses, in vitro and in vivo
(12, 13). Pharmacologic inhibition of TGF-β protect￾ed wild-type mice from pulmonary edema. Finally, we
examined whether active TGF-β would directly dis￾rupt the integrity of the alveolar epithelial barrier.
TGF-β directly increased alveolar epithelial perme￾ability in vitro by a mechanism that involved deple￾tion of intracellular glutathione. These data suggest
that TGF-β, locally activated by the αvβ6 integrin, is

We have shown that the integrin αvβ6 activates latent TGF-β in the lungs and skin. We show here that
mice lacking this integrin are completely protected from pulmonary edema in a model of bleomycin￾induced acute lung injury (ALI). Pharmacologic inhibition of TGF-β also protected wild-type mice
from pulmonary edema induced by bleomycin or Escherichia coli endotoxin. TGF-β directly increased
alveolar epithelial permeability in vitro by a mechanism that involved depletion of intracellular glu￾tathione. These data suggest that integrin-mediated local activation of TGF-β is critical to the devel￾opment of pulmonary edema in ALI and that blocking TGF-β or its activation could be effective
treatments for this currently untreatable disorder.

a critical mediator of pulmonary edema in ALI. Block￾ing TGF-β or its activation could thus be effective
treatments for this currently untreatable disorder.
Methods
Mice. Wild-type mice, 129/terSVEMS, were obtained from
The Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, Maine, USA). β6–/–
mice were bred and maintained according to institution￾al, state, and federal guidelines. Age- and sex-matched 8-
to 12-week-old littermates were used in all experiments. 
Intratracheal bleomycin or E. coli endotoxin administration.
Wild-type or β6–/– mice were given intratracheal saline
or bleomycin (0.05 IU in 60 µl sterile saline; Meade
Johnson, Princeton, New Jersey, USA). Five days later,
lung permeability was measured 4 hours after
intraperitoneal injection of 0.5 µCi of 125I-albumin. As
an index of lung edema we measured lung wet/dry
weight ratios gravimetrically using standard methods,
as in our previous studies (14). Briefly, before exsan￾guination, a blood sample was obtained to measure the
hemoglobin concentration and the water-to-dry weight
ratio of blood for the extravascular lung water calcula￾tion. Lungs were homogenized and the extravascular
lung water determined by calculating the water-to-dry
weight ratio using the following equation: W/D =
Qwet/Qdry in which Qwet is the difference between the
water content of the lung homogenate and the water
content of the blood in the lung and Qdry is the dry lung
weight calculated as the weight of the lungs minus the
blood and water volumes in the lung. As an index of
lung permeability we calculated the ratio of accumu￾lated tracer (counts per minute per gram of lung tissue)
in the extravascular spaces of the lungs (calculated by
the gravimetric method) to the mean plasma value
(counts per minute per gram of plasma).
In a second series of experiments, soluble chimeric
TGF-β type II receptor (25 µg diluted in 100 µl sterile
saline; USA Biogen Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts,
USA) or saline alone was administered intravenously
just before and 48 and 96 hours after bleomycin instil￾lation (pretreatment group) or 24 and 72 hours after
bleomycin instillation (treatment group). The third
series of experiments was designed to determine
whether pharmacological inhibition of TGF-β1 with
the soluble chimeric TGF-β type II receptor would pro￾tect against development of ALI in a more clinically rel￾evant model of ALI. Wild-type mice were pretreated
with the soluble chimeric TGF-β type II receptor or its
vehicle just before airspace instillation of E. coli endo￾toxin or of its vehicle (L-2880; 50 µg diluted in 50 µl
sterile saline) (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Missouri,
USA). Indices of lung permeability to protein and of
pulmonary edema were measured as described above.
To determine that the soluble receptor is a potent
inhibitor of both exogenous recombinant TGF-β and
of αvβ6-mediated activation of TGF-β, 1.6 × 104 mink
lung epithelial reporter cells (TMLC cells; ref. 15),
expressing firefly luciferase under the control of a por￾tion of the TGF-β–sensitive plasminogen activator
inhibitor-1 promoter, were suspended in DMEM con￾taining 10% FCS, plated in microtiter wells, and
allowed to attach for 1 hour. Test solutions (rhTGF-β1
and/or soluble TGF-β receptor) and/or test cells (β6-
transfected SW480 cells plated at the same density)
were added for 16–20 hours, and lysates were assayed
for luciferase activity as described (15). In all experi￾ments, one-way ANOVA and Fisher’s exact t test were
used to compare experimental with control groups.
Bronchoalveolar lavage and flow cytometry. Mice were
killed by cervical dislocation, and a blunt needle was
inserted into the upper trachea. Lavage was performed
by introducing five sequentia, 0.8-ml aliquots of PBS
into the lungs and carefully withdrawing the fluid.
Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid was centrifuged at
130 g for 5 minutes and the cell pellets were resus￾pended in 1-ml red blood cell lysis buffer (Sigma
Chemical Co.). Total cells were counted in a hemocy￾tometer, and a cytospin slide preparation was made
from a aliquot of each sample. Slides were stained with
a Diff-Quick stain set (Dade Diagnostic of Puerto Rico
Inc., Aguada, Puerto Rico), and a differential cell count
of 300 cells was made.
The remaining BAL cells were blocked with normal
goat serum (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, Califor￾nia, USA) at 4°C for 10 minutes and then labeled with a
mAb against MHC class II for 20 minutes at 4°C. After
washing twice with PBS, stained cells were resuspended
in 100 µl of PBS and analyzed by flow cytometry on a
Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems FACSort
(San Jose, California, USA).
Histology. The trachea and both lungs were fixed by
inflation at 25 cm H2O with 10% formalin and
embedded in paraffin for histology. Five-micrometer
sections were fixed in Histochoice (Fisher Scientific
Co., Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA) for staining with
hematoxylin and eosin.
Transepithelial electrical resistance measurements. Rat ATII
cells were isolated by elastase digestion and selective
adhesion plating on rat immunoglobulin G (16). Cells
were plated at a concentration of 106 cells/cm2 in
DMEM-H21 medium with 10% FCS. Twenty-four
hours later, ATII cell monolayers were exposed to
10–400 pM rhTGF-β1 for 24 hours or to 80 pM for
6–24 hours. Transepithelial electrical resistance (TER)
was measured at room temperature with an epithelial
voltmeter (Millicell-ERS; Millipore Corp., Bedford,
Massachusetts, USA) using Ag-AgCl electrodes. Before
measurements, electrodes were sterilized in 70%
ethanol for 10 minutes and allowed to equilibrate in
the cell culture medium for 60 minutes.
In a second series of experiments, ATII cell mono￾layers were exposed 24 hours after plating to active
rhTGF-β1 (80 pM) or to its vehicle in the presence or
absence of either a mouse mAb against all isoforms
of TGF-β (1D11; R&D Systems Inc., Minneapolis,
Minnesota, USA) or an isotypic irrelevant Ab. Twen￾ty-four hours later, TER was measured as described
above. In a third series of experiments, ATII cell
1538 The Journal of Clinical Investigation | June 2001 | Volume 107 | Number 12

monolayers were exposed 24 hours after plating to
active rhTGF-β1 (80 pM) or to its vehicle in the pres￾ence of either a monoethyl ester of glutathione
(100–400 pM; Sigma Chemical Co.) or its vehicle.
Twenty-four hours later, TER was measured as
described above. Reduced and oxidized glutathione
were measured using a variation of the HPLC method
reported by Martin (17).
In a fourth series of experiments, ATII cell monolay￾ers were exposed 24 hours after plating to active
rhTGF-β1 (80 pM) or its vehicle in the presence of
either ML-7 (3 µM) or ML-9 (50 µM), specific
inhibitors of the myosin light chain kinase or their
vehicles. Twenty-four hours later, TER was measured
as described above. In all experiments, one-way ANOVA
and Fisher’s exact t test were used to compare experi￾mental groups with control groups.
Results
β6–/– mice are protected against bleomycin-induced pul￾monary edema. We have reported recently that cells
expressing the αvβ6 integrin activate TGF-β1 and that
mice lacking this integrin are protected from pul￾monary fibrosis, a late response to lung injury that is
critically dependent on TGF-β activity (11). To deter￾mine whether locally activated TGF-β modulates the
alveolar flooding that causes morbidity and mortality
early after lung injury, we compared the increases in
lung permeability 5 days after treatment with intratra￾cheal bleomycin in wild-type mice and in mice lacking
the epithelial integrin αvβ6. We chose this time point
because in preliminary studies we found that
129/terSVEMS mice develop maximal increases in lung
permeability within 5 days after treatment with
bleomycin. Intratracheal bleomycin (0.05 IU) induced
the development of protein-rich pulmonary edema in
β6+/+ but not in β6–/– mice. Compared with saline-treat￾ed mice, there was a significant increase in the lung per￾meability to protein (Figure 1a) and in the extravascu￾lar water content of the lung (Figure 1b) in
bleomycin-treated β6+/+ mice compared with saline￾treated mice. In contrast, there was no change in either
index of pulmonary edema in bleomycin-treated β6–/–
mice (Figure 1, a and b). In preliminary studies, there
was no increase in pulmonary edema at any time point
up to 15 days after intratracheal bleomycin in β6–/–
mice (data not shown).
BAL fluid cellularity of β6–/– mice was characterized
at baseline by lymphocytic airway inflammation and
macrophage activation (foamy macrophages) com￾pared with their wild-type littermates, as we have
reported previously (18) (Figure 2). Five days after
instillation of bleomycin, there was an exaggeration
of the airway inflammatory response in β6–/– mice
compared with β6+/+ wild-type mice. Bleomycin
increased the numbers of lymphocytes, neutrophils,

and MHC II–expressing macrophages in the airspaces
of wild-type mice, but all of these effects were greater
in the airspaces of β6–/– mice. Interestingly, changes
in BAL cellularity in β6–/– mice did not correlate with
changes in lung protein and water permeability after
instillation of bleomycin.
Soluble chimeric TGF-β type II receptor inhibits
TGF-β1 activity in β6-expressing cells and protects
β6+/+ mice against bleomycin-induced pulmonary
edema. To more directly assess the role of TGF-β in this
process, we used a soluble TGF-β type II receptor–
IgG-Fc chimera to inhibit the binding of active TGF-β
to its receptor. We first determined that this soluble
TGF-β receptor is a potent inhibitor of both exogenous
recombinant TGF-β and of αvβ6-mediated activation
of TGF-β. Increasing concentrations of the TGF-β type
II receptor–IgG-Fc chimera caused a progressive
decrease in the luciferase activity resulting from the
stimulation of TMLC cells stably expressing a portion
of the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 promoter with
active rhTGF-β1 (Figure 3a). The soluble TGF-β type II
receptor–IgG-Fc chimera also caused concentration￾dependent inhibition of TGF-β1 activity in a coculture
bioassay containing TMLC and β6-transfected SW480
cells (Figure 3b). Soluble TGF-β type II receptor–
IgG-Fc chimera or saline alone was administered intra￾venously just before and 48 and 96 hours after
bleomycin instillation (pretreatment group) or 24 and
72 hours after bleomycin instillation (treatment
group). Pretreatment of wild-type mice with a soluble
TGF-β type II receptor–IgG-Fc chimera completely pre￾vented the increase in lung protein permeability
observed during the acute phase of lung injury after
airspace instillation of bleomycin (Figure 3c). Signifi￾cant protection against alveolar edema was still
observed when administration of this soluble chimeric
TGF-β receptor was started 24 hours after the chal￾lenge with bleomycin (Figure 3c). We have reported pre￾viously that the amount of total TGF-β1 was not dif￾ferent between mice lacking αvβ6 integrin and their
wild-type littermates and was not significantly affect￾ed by treatment with bleomycin (11).
Morphologic evidence of bleomycin-induced pul￾monary edema is absent in β6+/+mice and in wild-type
mice treated with TGF-ΙI receptor chimera. To further
examine the significance of the measurements of lung
water and permeability described above, we also eval￾uated lung morphology in wild-type and β6+/+ mice
after treatment with bleomycin or saline and in wild￾type mice treated with the TGF-β type II receptor
chimera. In wild-type mice instilled with bleomycin,
there was accumulation of red cells and proteinaceous
material in the alveoli (Figure 4). This was observed
neither in αvβ6 knockout mice nor in wild-type mice
that were pretreated with a soluble chimeric TGF-β
type II receptor before exposure to bleomycin (Figure
4). These data thus indicate that bleomycin caused
injury to both the lung endothelial and the alveolar
epithelial barriers.

± SEM) are representative of at least two comparable experiments
with five mice per group; AP < 0.05 relative to saline-treated mice; BP < 0.05 relative to bleomycin-treated mice that received vehicle.

Blockade of TGF-β protects wild-type mice against endotox￾in-induced pulmonary edema. We next determined whether
these findings would apply to another model of ALI, air￾space instillation of E. coli endotoxin, which is a more
classic initiator of ALI than instillation of bleomycin.
We found that the instillation of E. coli endotoxin (50 µg
in 50 µl) into the airspaces of wild-type mice caused a
significant increase in protein permeability and
extravascular water content of the lung (Figure 5). This
effect was significantly attenuated by the intravenous
administration of the chimeric TGF-β receptor (Figure
5). These findings and our present results are therefore
consistent with a model of lung injury in which tissue
injury induces expression and/or activation of the αvβ6
integrin, which in turn locally activates TGF-β1 already
present in latent form in the lung.
rhTGF-β1 decreases the TER across primary cultures of rat
alveolar epithelial type II cell monolayers by decreasing their
intracellular content of reduced glutathione. Two separate
barriers form the alveolar-capillary barrier, the
microvascular endothelium and the alveolar epitheli￾um. The acute phase of ALI often involves dysfunction
of both barriers of the lung. However, the alveolar
epithelium is much less permeable than the lung
endothelium under physiological conditions. The loss
of alveolar epithelial integrity has numerous conse￾quences for patients with ALI. It contributes to alveo￾lar flooding, disrupts secretion of surfactant, impairs
removal of edema fluid from the alveolar space, and
strongly affects patient survival. To assess whether
active TGF-β1 would directly disrupt the integrity of
the alveolar epithelial barrier, primary cultures of rat
alveolar epithelial type II (ATII) cells were incubated
with increasing concentrations of active rhTGF-β1.
Active rhTGF-β1 caused a dose- and time-dependent
decrease in TER (Figure 6a). This TGF-β1–dependent
loss of the integrity of the alveolar epithelial barrier
was prevented by pretreatment with a mouse mAb to
TGF-β1, but not by pretreatment with an irrelevant
isotypic Ab (Figure 6b), and was not associated with an
increase in the rate of apoptosis or necrosis in these
monolayers (as determined by TUNEL staining and
trypan-blue exclusion; data not shown).
We have recently reported that glutathione (GSH)
depletion markedly increased the permeability of the
alveolar epithelium to protein (19), and Arsalane and
coworkers have shown that TGF-β is a potent inhibitor
of GSH synthesis in lung epithelial cells (20). We there￾fore sought to determine whether the effects of TGF-β
on epithelial permeability were mediated by loss of
GSH. The rhTGF-β1–dependent decrease in TER was
progressively attenuated by pretreatment with increas￾The Journal of Clinical Investigation | June 2001 | Volume 107 | Number 12 1541

ing doses of a GSH monoethyl ester (Figure 6c). In
addition, active rhTGF-β1 caused a significant decrease
in the ATII cell content of reduced GSH associated with
a small increase in its intracellular oxidized form
(GSSG) (Figure 6d). Interestingly, in contrast to the
results reported previously for the endothelial barrier
(10), the TGF-β–induced increase in alveolar epithelial
permeability was not dependent on the activation of
myosin light-chain kinase. Indeed, two unrelated
inhibitors of this enzyme ML-7 and ML-9, did not pre￾vent the rhTGF-β1–dependent TER decrease across pri￾mary cultures of rat ATII cell monolayers (Figure 6e).
Discussion
The results of this study demonstrate that mice lacking
the integrin αvβ6, an integrin we have shown previous￾ly is capable of locally activating latent TGF-β (11), are
dramatically protected from pulmonary edema in a
bleomycin-induced model of ALI. Protection of β6–/–
mice was not explained by a difference in the alveolar
inflammatory response to bleomycin between mice defi￾cient in αvβ6 integrin and their wild-type littermates,
since, as we have reported previously (11) and have
shown again in the present study (Figure 2), the inflam￾matory response to bleomycin is actually enhanced in β6
subunit knockout mice. In addition to inducing TGF-β
activation, αvβ6 plays a role in cell proliferation and
migration (21, 22) and could thus have been affecting
the development of pulmonary edema by mechanisms
independent of TGF-β. Furthermore, the baseline
inflammation present in the lungs of β6 subunit knock￾out mice could have conditioned the lungs indirectly to
resist subsequent injury. However, administration of a
TGF-β antagonist to wild-type mice also prevented the
development of pulmonary edema in the same model of
ALI, directly implicating TGF-β in this process. More￾over, inhibition of TGF-β significantly inhibited pul￾monary edema when it was administered as late as 24
hours after the induction of bleomycin-mediated injury,
suggesting that if a similar mechanism is involved in ALI
in humans, blocking this pathway could be therapeuti￾cally useful. Comparable results were obtained with
another model using endotoxin, a more classic initiator
of ALI than instillation of bleomycin. We found that the
instillation of E. coli endotoxin into the airspaces of wild￾type littermates caused a significant increase in protein
permeability and extravascular water content of the
lung. This effect was also significantly attenuated by the
intravenous administration of a TGF-β antagonist (Fig￾ure 5). Taken together, these findings indicate that αvβ6
integrin-mediated, spatially restricted activation of
TGF-β1 in the distal airspaces of the lung may play an
important role in the development of pulmonary edema
during the early phase of ALI.
As noted above, increased permeability of both the
endothelium and epithelium contribute to alveolar

flooding in ALI. TGF-β1 could increase endothelial per￾meability through a previously reported effect of increas￾ing gaps between endothelial cells (10). This effect
appears to result from endothelial cell contraction
through the activation of a myosin light chain
kinase–dependent signaling cascade. However, TGF-β’s
in vitro effect on the integrity of vascular endothelium
started within 1–2 hours, was maximal 8–9 hours after
exposure to TGF-β, and appears to be dependent on the
proliferative state and the degree of confluence of the
endothelial cell monolayers. For example, quiescent cells
have been reported to be resistant to this effect (23).
Thus, it is uncertain whether effects of TGF-β on the
endothelium could entirely explain our in vivo results.
In fact, lung morphology of wild-type mice instilled with
bleomycin showed accumulation of red cells and pro￾teinaceous material in the alveoli. This was observed nei￾ther in αvβ6 knockout mice nor in wild-type mice that
were pretreated with a soluble chimeric TGF-β type II
receptor before exposure to bleomycin (Figure 4). These
data thus indicate that bleomycin caused injury to both
the lung endothelial and the alveolar epithelial barriers.
The alveolar epithelium is much less permeable than the
lung endothelium under physiological conditions. As
noted above, loss of alveolar epithelial integrity has
numerous consequences for patients with ALI and
strongly affects patient survival (4, 24). Our finding that
rhTGF-β1 caused a dose- and time-dependent increase
in TER in vitro suggests that TGF-β could directly
increase the permeability of the alveolar epithelium, an
effect that could be critical to its role in the induction of
pulmonary edema in vivo.
The mechanism by which TGF-β increases epithelial
permeability appears to be distinct from the myosin￾light chain kinase–dependent contraction reported for
endothelial cells. The results of the current study sug￾gest that TGF-β increases epithelial permeability by a
mechanism that depends on depletion of intracellular
GSH and an increase in the concentration of its oxi￾dized form, GSSG. The potential significance of these
findings is supported by recent reports that GSH is
depleted from epithelial lining fluid in experimental
models of ALI (25) and in patients with ALI (26) and by
our recent report that GSH depletion markedly
increased the permeability of the alveolar epithelium to
protein (19). A possible explanation for our findings is
provided by evidence that TGF-β inhibits GSH synthe￾sis in lung epithelial cells by its transcriptional effect on
the GSH rate-limiting enzyme γ-glutamylcysteine syn￾thetase (20). Furthermore, TGF-β has been shown to
act as a pro-oxidant by increasing the cellular genera￾tion of H2O2 (27). Finally, GSSG itself has been shown
recently to directly increase paracellular permeability
in epithelial monolayers (28). However, one must be
cautious in interpreting the in vitro experiments
described here, since alterations in cellular oxida￾tion/reduction could have a number of unmeasured
effects in addition to the alterations in intracellular
GSH/GSSG concentrations we describe.
TGF-β is generally considered a central mediator of
the resolution phase of tissue injury, inhibiting tissue
inflammation and enhancing scarring. Our results,
suggesting a critical role for this cytokine in the alveo￾lar flooding that characterizes the early response to
lung injury were therefore unexpected. However, a least
one previous report did suggest a role for this cytokine
early in a model of lung injury (29). In that study, an Ab
to TGF-β was shown to inhibit the induction of proin￾flammatory cytokines by alveolar macrophages after
hemorrhagic shock. Since the authors did not report
measurements of pulmonary edema in that study, its
relevance to the current findings is uncertain.
The relevance of our results to ALI in humans remains
an important question that cannot be completely
addressed here because of the complexity of the syn￾drome and the inherent limitations of any murine
model of ALI. However, our data suggest that activation
of latent TGF-β by interaction with the epithelial inte￾grin αvβ6 and subsequent direct effects of TGF-β on
alveolar epithelial cells (and perhaps adjacent endothe￾lial cells) could play a critical role in the alveolar flood￾ing that characterizes this often lethal syndrome. Mor￾tality from ALI is related to the loss of epithelial barrier
function (24) and to the production of collagen (8), an
index of pulmonary fibrosis. The results of this and pre￾vious studies suggest that both of these determinants of
mortality may be mediated by activated TGF-β. Current
efforts to therapeutically intervene in this syndrome
have been hampered by the fact that most interventions
studied are effective only if administered before the onset
of injury, while patients do not come to medical atten￾tion until after the lung injury has occurred. Since a
TGF-β inhibitor effectively attenuated alveolar flooding
when administered as late as 24 hours after the onset of
injury, targeting the integrin αvβ6, the process of inte￾grin-mediated TGF-β activation or TGF-β and its recep￾tors could provide novel therapeutic strategies for treat￾ment of this common, often fatal clinical syndrome.
