Abstract
Current options for the treatment of the early-stage HCC conforming to the Milan criteria consist of liver
transplantation, hepatic resection (HR), transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) and radiofrequency ablation
(RFA) .Whether HR or RFA is the better treatment for early HCC has long been debated. The aim of our paper is to
compare the therapeutic effects of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and hepatic resection (HR) in the treatment of
early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Controlled trials evaluating the efficacy between RFA and HR for the
treatment of early-stage HCC published before June 2013 were searched electronically using MEDLINE, PubMed,
Cochrane Library, and EMBASE databases. Using inclusion and exclusion criteria, two randomized controlled trials
and 10 nonrandomized controlled trials were included in the meta- analysis. The results showed that the 3,5-year
overall survival rates and 1,3,5 disease-free survival rates were significantly lower after RFA than after HR. However,
complications after treatment were less common and the length of hospital stay was significantly shorter after RFA.
Additionally, there was no significant difference in the 1-year overall survival rate between RFA and HR. The
conclusions of the results show that the difference in the short-term effectiveness of RFA and HR in the treatment
of small HCC is not notable, but the long-term efficacy of HR is better than that of RFA. However, HR is associated
with more complications and a longer hospital stay.
Keywords: Radiofrequency ablation, Hepatic resection, Early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma, Meta-analysis
Background
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most com￾mon malignancy cancer worldwide and the third most
common cause of cancer mortality [1,2]. With the
improvement of diagnostic modalities for HCC meet￾ing the Milan criteria, defined as a single HCC ≤5 cm
in the maximum diameter or up to three nodules <3 cm,
the relevance ratio and detection of early-stage HCC have
improved significantly [3].
Current options for the treatment of the early-stage
HCC conforming to the Milan criteria consist of liver
transplantation, hepatic resection (HR), transcatheter
arterial chemoembolization (TACE) and radiofrequency
ablation (RFA) [4-7]. Theoretically, the best treatment is
liver transplantation [8-13], which offers the potential to
both resect the entire potentially tumor-bearing liver
and eliminate the cirrhosis. However, the limited avail￾ability of suitable living donors, high cost, as well as
an increased waiting period, has raised the demand for
treatment strategies of early HCC, such as HR and RFA.
Whether HR or RFA is the better treatment for early
HCC has long been debated. Since the introduction of
ablation for the treatment of HCC, there have been only
two randomized controlled trials [14,15] and therefore
the evidence of equipoise between RFA and HR is still
controversial. HR has generally been accepted as the first
treatment of choice for HCC in many centers. Neverthe￾less, the associated cirrhosis limits the extent of surgery
and thus increases the risk of postoperative liver failure.

RFA, which is a promising and recently developed abla￾tion technique, was recommended as the primary treat￾ment option for patients with early-stage HCC who are
not suitable for resection or transplantation in the 2005
practice guidelines issued by the American Association
for the Study of Liver Diseases [16]. It induces deep
thermal injury in hepatic tissue while sparing the normal
parenchyma. However, Huang and colleagues [14], Molinari
and Helton [17], and Takayama and colleagues [18]
reported that HR had more advantages (survival and re￾currence rates) regardless of tumor size (larger or smaller
than 3 cm; even smaller than 2 cm). Besides, Chen and
colleagues [15], Hong and colleagues [19], Vivarelli and
colleagues [20], and Montorsi and colleagues [21] con￾cluded that RFA was as effective as HR in the treatment of
solitary and small HCC.
In the current study, by performing a systematic review,
we attempted to compare HR versus RFA as a primary
treatment option of HCC meeting the Milan criteria.
Methods
Search strategy
Literature search
Electronic searches were performed using PubMed and
Medline until June 2013. The following MeSH search
headings, all in English, were used: “radiofrequency abla￾tion”, “hepatic resection”, “HCC” and “hepatocellular
carcinoma”. These terms were used in different combi￾nations. In addition, we reviewed the reference lists of
the original articles and reviews on the topic to identify
other potentially eligible trials. No language restrictions
were made.
Data extraction and quality assessment
Two reviewers (CD and ML) independently extracted
the following parameters from each study: 1) first author
and year of publication; 2) number of patients, patients’
characteristics, study design; and follow-up; 3) treatment
outcomes. All relevant text, tables and figures were
reviewed for data extraction. Discrepancies between the
two reviewers were resolved by discussion and consen￾sus. The quality of all selected articles was scored in ac￾cordance with the PRISMA Statement [22].
Criteria for inclusion and exclusion
For inclusion in the meta-analysis, a study had to fulfill
the following criteria: (1) all cases were diagnosed through
pathology tests or more than two image logical examina￾tions combined with clinical data comparing the initial
therapeutic effects of RFA with or without TACE and HR
for the treatment of early HCC, despite the etiology of
liver disease, differences in viral hepatitis, or cirrhotic
status; (2) no patients received any anticancer treatment
before RFA or HR; (3) clearly documented indications
for RFA and HR; (4) if two or more studies were
reported by the same authors in the same institution,
either the study of higher quality or the most recent
publication was included in the analysis; (5) Child-Pugh
class A or B; (6) follow-up time >3 years.
The exclusion criteria for this meta-analysis were as
follows: (1) only one treatment method was used and no
contrastive study was performed; (2) previously treated
metastatic hepatic carcinoma or recurrent liver cancers;
(3) vascular invasion, distant metastasis, or other lesions;
(4) follow-up time <3 years or a small sample size (<100).
Data analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using Review Manager
Software (RevMan 5.2; Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford,
UK). The continuous descriptive data of the RFA and HR
groups are reported as the mean ± standard deviation, and
dichotomous data are reported as the case number (n).
The Mantel-Haenszel Q-statistic was used to assess
heterogeneity among the studies, and the I
2 statistic was
computed to examine the proportion of total variation
in the study estimate due to heterogeneity. We consid￾ered P > 0.10 or P ≤ 0.10/I
2 ≤ 50% to indicate no signifi￾cant heterogeneity between the trials and, in such cases,
a fixed effect model was selected for analysis. Conversely,
we considered P ≤ 0.10/I
2 > 50% to indicate significant het￾erogeneity, and a random effect model was used. In the in￾tegration results, P < 0.05 indicated statistical significance.
Extensive efforts were made to remove all duplicated
data and include all studies published to date. Publica￾tion bias in outcomes was assessed and treated using
standard methodology. Funnel plots were used to visu￾ally inspect the relationship between sample size and
treatment effects for the two groups.
Results
Search results
A total of 243 relevant articles were identified in a com￾bined search of MEDLINE, PubMed, Cochrane Library,
and EMBASE databases covering studies published be￾fore June 2013 and a manual approach (search of studies
cited in previous reviews and of reference lists from the
identified articles). In total, 222 articles were excluded
after scanning the title/abstract because they were not
relevant to the purpose of this meta-analysis, and full￾length articles could not be obtained for eight references.
One duplicate article from the same author was ex￾cluded [23]. Ultimately, 12 articles were included in the
systematic review, including two randomized controlled
trials and 10 nonrandomized controlled trials (Figure 1).
A total of 8,612 subjects were included in the meta￾analysis: 4,295 patients who were treated with RFA as
the initial treatment and 4,279 patients who underwent
HR. The follow-up auxiliary examinations included

radiographic tests, such as ultrasound, computed tomog￾raphy or magnetic resonance imaging, in combination
with physical examination. The largest study included
5,879 patients [11], and the smallest study included 100
patients [24]. The characteristics of the 12 studies in￾cluded in the meta-analysis are listed in Table 1.
Meta-analysis
We mainly compared the following eight indicators
between RFA and HR in the treatment of small HCC:
1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates; 1-, 3-, and 5-year
disease-free rates; post-treatment complications; and
hospital stay.
One-year overall survival rate
Eleven studies including 2,733 patients [14,15,19,20,24-27,
29-31] compared the 1-year overall survival rate after RFA
and HR. Using the odds ratio (OR) as an indicator, we
used the χ2 test to examine heterogeneity. The result
was P = 0.23/I
2 = 23%, which indicated that there was
no heterogeneity between the two groups. Therefore, we
used a fixed effect model to perform the meta-analysis,
the results of which were as follows: OR = 0.76; 95%
confidence interval (CI) = 0.58 to 1.00; P = 0.05. These
findings indicated that there were no differences in
the 1-year overall survival rate between RFA and HR
(Figure 2).
Three-year overall survival rate
The same 11 studies were also used to compare the
3-year overall survival rate between RFA and HR. The
findings of the heterogeneity test were P = 0.01/I
2 = 56%,
which indicated that there was significant heterogeneity
between the two groups. Consequently, we used a random
effect model for the analysis, the results of which were
as follows: OR = 0.59; 95% CI = 0.43 to 0.81; P = 0.001.
Thus, the 3-year overall survival rate after HR was sig￾nificantly higher than that after RFA (Figure 3).
Five-year overall survival rate
Five studies including 1,899 patients [14,26,27,29,31] were
used to compare the 5-year overall survival rate after
RFA and HR. The results of the heterogeneity test were
P = 0.03/I2 = 63%, indicating significant heterogeneity
between the two groups. Therefore, we used a random
effect model, the results of which were as follows: OR =
0.46; 95% CI = 0.32 to 0.67; P < 0.0001. These findings
indicated that the 5-year overall survival rate after HR
was significantly higher than that after RFA (Figure 4).

One-year disease-free survival rate
Twelve studies including 8,612 patients [14,15,19,20,24-31]
were used to compare the 1-year disease-free survival rate
after RFA and HR. The results of the heterogeneity test
were P = 0.16/I
2 = 29%, indicating no heterogeneity be￾tween the two groups. Therefore, we used a fixed effect
model for the meta-analysis, the results of which were as
follows: OR = 0.82; 95% CI = 0.69 to 0.97; P = 0.02. These
findings revealed that the 1-year disease-free survival rate
after HR was significantly higher than that after RFA
(Figure 5).
Three-year disease-free survival rate
The same 12 studies were used to compare the 3-year
disease-free survival rate between RFA and HR. The re￾sults of the heterogeneity test were P = 0.16/I
2 = 31%,
indicating no heterogeneity between the two groups.
Therefore, we used a fixed effect model for the meta￾analysis, the results of which were as follows: OR = 0.59;
95% CI = 0.43 to 0.81; P = 0.001. These findings indi￾cated that the 3-year disease-free survival rate after HR
was significantly higher than that after RFA (Figure 6).
Five-year disease-free survival rate
Five studies including 1,899 patients [14,26,27,29,31] were
used to compare the difference in the 5-year disease-free
survival rate between RFA and HR. The results of the het￾erogeneity test were P = 0.17/I2 = 38%, indicating no het￾erogeneity between the two groups. Therefore, we used a
fixed effect model for the meta-analysis, the results of
which were as follows: OR = 0.54; 95% CI = 0.44 to 0.66;
P < 0.00001. These data revealed that the 5-year disease￾Study or Subgroup

free survival rate after HR was significantly higher than that
after RFA (Figure 7).
Complications after treatment
The complications after treatment included gastrointes￾tinal bleeding, ascites, serious infection, biliary duct injury,
jaundice, hepatic failure, and death. Six studies including
1,782 patients [14,15,24,26,27,29] were used to compare
the difference in the number of complications between
RFA and HR. The results of the heterogeneity test were
P = 0.04/I
2 = 57%, indicating significant heterogeneity
between the two groups. Therefore, we used a random
effect model for the meta-analysis, the results of which were
as follows: OR = 0.32; 95% CI = 0.18 to 0.56; P < 0.0001.
These results revealed that more complications occurred
after HR than after RFA (Figure 8).
Hospital stay
Three studies including 1,324 patients [14,15,24] were
used to compare the difference in hospital stay between
RFA and HR. The results of the heterogeneity test were
P < 0.00001/I
2 = 100%, indicating significant heterogen￾eity between the two groups. Therefore, we used a ran￾dom effect model for the analysis, the results of which
were as follows: OR: −8.57; 95% CI = −14.53 to −2.61;
P = 0.005. These data indicated that the length of hos￾pital time was significantly longer after HR than after
RFA (Figure 9).
Sensitivity analysis and publication bias
We used fixed and random effect models to test each in￾dicator, and the results were correlated. We created a
funnel plot for each comparison (Figure 10). These eight
plots were basically inverted and funnel-shaped with bi￾lateral symmetry, indicating a lack of publication bias
and reliable conclusions.

resection, RFA, microwave therapy, TACE, and molecular
targeted drug therapy [32]. HR has always been regarded
as the traditional first-line treatment for small HCC. With
the development of RFA, this modality may become the
first-line treatment for HCC. Therefore, many controlled
trials have compared HR and RFA in the treatment of
small HCC. To verify the effectiveness and safety of these
treatments, it is necessary to perform meta-analysis of
these trials; this meta-analysis may also provide a basis
for evidence-based medicine.
RFA is a medical procedure in which part of the tumor
is ablated using the heat generated from a high-frequency
alternating current under image guidance (such as ultra￾sound, computed tomography or magnetic resonance
imaging). Currently, RFA is mainly used for primary
hepatic carcinoma that cannot be resected [33], meta￾static hepatic carcinoma [34], and recurrent hepatic car￾cinoma after surgery [35], as well as for patients who
are unwilling to undergo HR. RFA has been regarded as
a suitable treatment for HCC because of its low trauma,
low number of complications, and strong repeatability [36].
Meta-analysis can be used to evaluate the efficacy of
RFA and HR in treating small HCC in patients with
tumor diameters ≤5 cm. In this meta-analysis, no dif￾ference was noted between HR and RFA regarding the
1-year overall survival rate. However, HR was associ￾ated with higher 3- and 5-year overall survival rates.
Additionally, the 1-, 3-, and 5-year disease-free rates
were significantly higher after HR than after RFA. The
results of this meta-analysis are also confirmed by two
Markov models [17,37].
This finding may be explained by the fact that RFA is
primarily directed at primary tumor lesions, but some
satellite lesions may be missed. In contrast, HR can be
used to resect the primary lesions as well as satellite
lesions transferred through portal vein branches. More￾over, factors such as the shape and distribution of the
tumor and range of ablation have a much stronger effect
on RFA than on HR.
Another comparison revealed that RFA is associated
with fewer complications and a shorter hospital stay, in￾dicating that RFA is relatively safe and noninvasive.
Our study findings revealed that RFA is a safe and ef￾fective modality for treating early-stage HCC. However,
considering the better survival rate after HR and its abil￾ity to prevent recurrence, HR has an irreplaceable role

in the treatment of HCC, which makes it the first-line
treatment for this malignancy.
The limitation of our study was that only two random￾ized controlled trials were included. Therefore, we expect
that more researchers will perform large, well-designed
randomized controlled trials to clarify which treatment is
most effective against HCC.
