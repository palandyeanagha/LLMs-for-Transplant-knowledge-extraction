Abstract
This report documents the formation of stable fetal cardio￾myocyte grafts in the myocardium of dystrophic dogs. Pre￾liminary experiments established that the dystrophin gene
product could be used to follow the fate of engrafted cardio￾myocytes in dystrophic mdx mice. Importantly, ultrastruc￾tural analyses revealed the presence of intercalated discs
consisting of fascia adherens, desmosomes, and gap junc￾tions at the donor-host cardiomyocyte border. To deter￾mine if isolated cardiomyocytes could form stable intra￾cardiac grafts in a larger species, preparations of dissociated
fetal canine cardiomyocytes were delivered into the hearts
of adult CXMD (canine X-linked muscular dystrophy) dogs.
CXMD dogs, like Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients
and mdx mice, fail to express dystrophin in both cardiac
and skeletal muscle. Engrafted fetal cardiomyocytes, identi￾fied by virtue of dystrophin immunoreactivity, were ob￾served to be tightly juxtaposed with host cardiomyocytes as
long as 10 wk after engraftment, the latest date analyzed.
Confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed the presence
of connexin43, a major constituent of the gap junction, at
the donor-host cardiomyocyte border. The presence of in￾tracardiac grafts was not associated with arrhythmogenesis
in the CXMD model. These results indicate that fetal cardio￾myocyte grafting can successfully augment cardiomyocyte
number in larger animals. (J. Clin. Invest. 1995. 96:2034-

Introduction
It is generally believed that the proliferative capacity of the
adult mammalian myocardium is limited. Consequently cardio￾myocyte loss resulting from injury or disease is essentially irre￾versible. The ability to augment cardiomyocyte number might

therefore be of therapeutic value, provided that the new myo￾cytes functionally integrate with the pre-existing myocardium.
One potential approach to augment myocyte number in the
adult heart entails the direct engraftment of isolated muscle
cells. It is now established that several types of myocytes can
be stably introduced into the adult murine myocardium. For
example, AT-1 tumor cardiomyocytes (a differentiated tumor
cell lineage derived from transgenic mice which expressed the
SV-40 large T-antigen oncoprotein in the myocardium) formed
stable intracardiac grafts in the hearts of syngeneic adult animals
(1). The usefulness of AT-1 cardiomyocytes for long-term en￾graftment studies is dramatically limited due to their trans￾formed phenotype. C2C12 myoblasts have also been used to
generate cardiac grafts (2-4). Engrafted C2C12 myoblasts rap￾idly withdrew from the cell cycle and fused to form myotubes
(2). Although the nascent myotubes were observed to be
aligned with host myocardial fibers, the potential for functional
coupling between host and donor myocytes is currently un￾known. More recently, fetal murine cardiomyocytes were used
to form stable grafts in the adult heart (5). These experiments
relied on the use of transgenic mice (designated MHC-nLAC)
which expressed a nuclear localized ,3-galactosidase (,/GAL)'
reporter gene in cardiac myocytes. The fate of engrafted donor
cells was tracked by virtue of the transgene-encoded /3GAL
activity. While desmosomes were observed to connect donor
cells with the host myocardium, the presence of nascent gap
junctions could not be established unequivocally. The fetal
cardiomyocyte grafts were not arrhythmogenic, and were pres￾ent for as long as 6 mo (5).
Although these studies collectively demonstrated that aug￾mentation of myocyte number in the adult murine heart is feasi￾ble, it was not clear if the process would be equally successful
in larger species. The importance of this caveat is underscored
by results obtained with myoblast transfer into skeletal muscle
beds: although the procedure worked well in murine systems
(6-8), results obtained to date in humans and dogs have been
relatively disappointing (9-11).
As indicated above, fetal cardiomyocyte engraftment experi￾ments require a reliable marker with which to follow the fate of
donor cells. The initial studies in mice utilized a cardiomyocyte￾specific /3GAL transgene reporter. Unfortunately the use of
analogous transgene reporters in larger species more amenable
to interventional cardiovascular experimentation and functional

analyses is fiscally and experimentally impractical. A series
of murine experiments was therefore initiated to determine if
naturally occurring polymorphisms or mutations could be ex￾ploited to follow the fate of engrafted fetal cardiomyocytes. The
dystrophin gene product was selected because it is expressed
at high levels in cardiac as well as skeletal muscle. These studies
served as a direct prelude for experiments in larger species, as
both murine and canine models lacking the dystrophin gene
product are available.
The results reported here indicate that the dystrophin gene
product can be reliably used to monitor the fate of engrafted
fetal cardiac myocytes in dystrophic mdx mice. Nascent interca￾lated discs comprised of desmosomes, fascia adherens, and gap
junctions were observed to connect host and donor cardiomyo￾cytes in the murine model. Analogous experiments using canine
X-linked muscular dystrophy (CXMD) dogs, a canine model
of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, indicated that fetal cardio￾myocyte engrafting was readily extended to larger species more
amenable to physiologic characterization. Connexin43 immuno￾reactivity was observed at donor-host cardiomyocyte borders,
suggesting the formation of gap junctions. Importantly, the pres￾ence of fetal cardiomyocyte grafts in the canine myocardium
did not predispose the host animals to overt arrhythmogenic
episodes. The implications of these results with respect to the
potential for therapeutic cardiac grafting is discussed.
Methods
Mouse cardiomyocyte grafting. Single cell preparations of transgenic
fetal donor cardiomyocytes were prepared and injected into the left
ventricular wall of dystrophic [C3HeB/FeJ X C57B1/lOScSn-mdx/
J]FI males essentially as described previously (5). Briefly, females
with 15-d embryos (onset of pregnancy determined by vaginal plugs)
were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Embryos were removed, decapi￾tated, and hearts were harvested under PBS, and ventricles and atria
were separated. Transgenic ventricles (identified by cardiac ,6GAL ac￾tivity) were digested in 0.1% collagenase (Worthington) in DPBS (Dul￾becco's phosphate-buffered saline; Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO)
for 45 min, and were triturated with a Pasteur pipette in PC-1 medium
(Ventrex, Coons Rapids MN) with 10% FBS, resulting in a suspension
of single cells. Immediately after isolation, fetal cardiomyocytes were
washed three times with DPBS and directly injected into the ventricular
myocardium of syngeneic host animals under open heart surgery as
described (5). 1-10 x 104 cells were injected in a volume of 2-3 Al
using a plastic syringe fitted with a 30-gauge needle. C3Heb/FeJ and
C57B 1/ lOScSn-mdx/J mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory
(Bar Harbor MA).
Canine cardiomyocyte grafting. Third trimester mongrel dogs were
sedated 20 min before surgery with 1 mg Butorphanol (intramuscular).
Anesthesia was then induced using Thiopental Sodium (intravenous) at
25 mg/kg. The dogs were intubated and placed on the surgical table in
a left lateral recumbency. Anesthesia was maintained with Isoflurane
(2% vaporized in oxygen delivered at 2 liters/min). Fetuses were deliv￾ered by Caesarean-section, heparinized (10,000 U/kg intraperitoneal),
and the hearts removed and single cell suspensions of cardiomyocytes
prepared by retrograde collagenase perfusion on a Langendorff appara￾tus as previously described (12). Isolated cells were rinsed once with
DME supplemented with 20% FBS, and then three times with serum￾free DME before engraftment. For engraftment, CXMD dogs (6-9 mo
old) were sedated and anesthetized as described above. The dogs were
prepared for surgery, and the chest opened in layers at the fifth intercos￾tal space. The left lung was reflected away from the heart, the pericardial
fat dissected, and a 5-cm incision made in the pericardium. After the
fetal cardiomyocytes were delivered, a vacuum tube was placed in the
thoracic cavity to remove blood and fluids. The chest was closed in
layers using continuous and/or interrupted suturing, the skin was closed
with skin staples and air in the thoracic cavity was evacuated using the
Valsalva technique. The dogs were gradually weaned from the gas
anesthetic agent by progressively reducing the Isoflurane flow rate to
zero, and then challenged to begin independent respiration. To block
graft rejection, dogs were treated daily with cyclosporine (15 mg/kg)
and corticosteroid (2 mg/kg), starting 1 d before engraftment. After
one week, the treatment was reduced to alternating days for the duration
of the study.
Immunohistologic analysis offetal cardiomyocyte grafts. After sacri￾fice, engrafted hearts were dissected, cryoprotected in 30% sucrose,
embedded and sectioned at 10 jm using standard histologic techniques
(13). For anti-dystrophin immunohistology (murine and canine grafts),
sections were incubated with CAP 6-10 (gift of Dr. T. Byers, Indiana
University) or DYS1 (Novocastra Laboratories, Newcastle upon Tyne,
UK) in 1 x PBS, 1% BSA for 24 h at 40C, rinsed and reacted with a
rhodamine conjugated secondary antibody. For anti-utrophin immuno￾histology (canine grafts), sections were incubated with monoclonal anti￾body DRP2 (which recognizes the utrophin isoform which is upregu￾lated in dystrophic tissue, Novocastra Laboratories) in 1 x PBS, 1%
BSA for 60 min at room temperature, rinsed, and signal was amplified
with the biotin-strepavidin system using a FITC conjugate. For X-GAL
(5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-,6-D-galactoside) staining (murine grafts),
sections were postfixed in acetone:methanol (1:1) and overlaid with 1
mg/ml X-GAL, 5 mM potassium ferricyanide, 5 mM potassium ferrocy￾anide and 2 mM magnesium chloride in PBS. Sections were then coun￾terstained with H and E according to manufacturer's specifications
(Sigma Diagnostics, St. Louis MO). For anti-connexin43 staining (ca￾nine grafts), sections were reacted with MAB3068 (Chemicon Interna￾tional, Temecula CA) in 1 X PBS, 1% BSA for 24 hrs at 4°C. Sections
were then reacted with a FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary
antibody.
Ultrastructural analysis of murine cardiac grafts. Engrafted mice
were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, hearts were harvested and per￾fused on a Langendorff apparatus with 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M
cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4). After immersion fixation overnight in the
same buffer, 200 gm coronal sections were made with a vibratome, and
the engrafted regions identified by X-GAL as described above. Regions
carrying fetal cardiomyocyte grafts were post-fixed in osmium tetroxide
and stained en bloc with uranyl acetate. Dehydration and infiltration
times were adjusted to minimize leaching of X-GAL reaction product
while retaining adequate morphology. All remaining TEM protocols
were as described previously (1, 2, 5).
Electrocardiographic analysis. Engrafted dogs were sedated and
anesthetized as described above and placed on a surgical table in a
supine recumbency. A 12 lead ECG was then recorded using a Marquette
Electronics Mac 15 recorder (Milwaukee WI) with the leads attached
to the animal in the standard 12 lead configuration: right foreleg, left
foreleg, right hindleg, left hindleg and six chest leads.
Results
To determine if the dystrophin gene product could be used to
monitor the fate of engrafted fetal cardiomyocytes, the MHC￾nLAC transgene was crossed into a [C57B1/1OSnJ X C3Heb/
FeJ] F1 background, and donor cardiomyocytes from the re￾sulting transgenic animals were isolated at embryonic day 15.
The donor cardiomyocytes expressed the dystrophin gene prod￾uct as well as the transgene-encoded /3GAL reporter (data not
shown). Recipient animals were generated by crossing mdx
(C57B1/1OScSn-mdx/J) females with C3HeB/FeJ males.
Cardiomyocytes in the resulting male F1 animals had a Xdys/
Y genotype, did not express dystrophin, and were nontransgenic
for the MHC-nLAC reporter (data not shown). By employing
these crosses, the resulting host and donor cells were syngeneic.
Donor cardiomyocytes were delivered to the left ventricular

free wall in an open chest procedure as described previously
(1, 5).
Immunohistologic analyses revealed the presence of dys￾trophin-positive donor cardiomyocytes within the dystrophin￾negative host myocardium at one month post-engraftment (Fig.
1, A and B). Dystrophin positive cells were detected in approxi￾mately 60% (n = 44) of the animals receiving fetal cardiomyo￾cyte injections, in agreement with previous results which relied
on the MHC-nLAC reporter (5). To rule out the possibility that
the observed dystrophin immunoreactivity was due to reversion
at the dystrophin locus in host cardiomyocytes, adjacent sections
were stained with X-GAL. The donor cardiomyocytes were
easily identified by intense blue nuclear staining due to the
/3GAL reporter (Fig. 1, D and E). These data indicated that the
dystrophin gene product could be used to follow the fate of
engrafted fetal cardiomyocytes. As expected, neither dystrophin
nor X-GAL signal could be detected in control sections of non￾engrafted mdx myocardium (Fig. 1, C and F, respectively).
Finally, it is of interest to note that although the overall distribu￾tion of dystrophin positive cells was similar to the distribution
of X-GAL positive cells on adjacent sections (compare Fig. 1,
A and B to D and E, respectively), the number of graft cells
appeared greater with dystrophin staining. Since a 10-,um sec￾tion will undoubtedly miss a significant number of the nuclei
present in the cardiomyocytes sampled, this discrepancy is sim￾ply an artifact of sectioning.
Although previous studies clearly identified the presence
of desmosomes and fascia adherens between engrafted fetal
cardiomyocytes and the host myocardium, the presence of gap
junctions was not established (5). Collectively these three struc￾tures comprise the intercalated disc, a cardiomyocyte junctional
complex which frequently exhibits a step-wise morphology con￾sisting of transverse and lateral regions. The desmosomes (inter￾cellular contacts responsible for the propagation of contractile
forces) and fascia adherens (cell membrane anchors for the
terminal actin filaments of the myofibril) reside in the transverse
region of the intercalated disc. The lateral area of the interca￾lated disc contains gap junctions, which are the electrical con￾duit for action potential propagation through the myocardium.
The formation of gap junctions between donor and host myocar￾dium is an absolute prerequisite for excitation-contraction cou￾pling.
Engrafted mdx hearts were subjected to ultrastructural anal￾yses to unequivocally establish the presence of gap junctions
between donor and host cardiomyocytes. The fixation, staining
and embedding procedures were optimized so as to retain satis￾factory morphology while providing unambiguous identification
of donor and host cells. Engrafted fetal cardiomyocytes were
observed to be tightly juxtaposed with host cells (Fig. 2 A).
As in previous studies (5), donor cardiomyocytes were identi￾fied by the presence of the X-GAL reaction product, which
appeared as a perinuclear crystalloid deposit (Fig. 2 D, arrows).
Host cardiomyocytes lacked the perinuclear crystalloid deposit
(Fig. 2 B). Desmosomes and fascia adherens were observed in
the transverse regions of an intercalated disc in low magnifica￾tion micrographs (Fig. 2 A, arrows). Examination of high mag￾nification micrographs revealed the presence of laminar struc￾tures on the lateral region of the intercalated disc (Fig. 2 C,
arrows): this structural motif is diagnostic for gap junctions.
Thus all of the physical attributes required for action potential
and force propagation are present between the donor and host
cardiomyocytes in the murine system.
To determine if the fetal cardiomyocyte grafting procedure
could be extended to larger species, experiments were initiated

mice, CXMD dogs do not express dystrophin ( 14). As such,
the dystrophin gene product could once again be used to follow
the fate of engrafted cardiomyocytes. CXMD dogs were grafted
with fetal cardiomyocytes isolated from early third trimester
mongrel animals. In all cases, a portion of the fetal heart was
subjected to immunohistologic analyses to ensure that the donor
cells were dystrophin positive. The recipients were maintained
on a regimen of cyclosporine and corticosteroid treatment to
prevent graft rejection. Hearts were harvested-at various times
after implantation, and the engrafted region was dissected and
processed for immunohistology using either the CAP 6-10 or
DYS1 anti-dystrophin antibodies.
Phase contrast analysis of engrafted regions from CXMD
hearts revealed a typical myocardial morphology exhibiting
well-aligned cardiomyocytes (Fig. 3 A). Visualization of the
number of these cardiomyocytes were dystrophin positive donor
cells (Fig. 3 B). In contrast, no dystrophin signal was observed
in regions of the myocardium which were not engrafted, consis￾tent with the low reversion rate for this mutation. It should also
be noted that the rare reversions which do occur in the CXMD
myocardium invariably appear as isolated myocytes (B. J. Coo￾per, unpublished observation), rather than as the relatively large
regions of dystrophin positive cells which were seen in the
engrafted hearts (Fig. 3, B and C).
Additional immunohistologic analyses were performed with
an anti-utrophin antibody. Utrophin, an autosomal homologue
of the dystrophin locus, has been observed to be up-regulated
in dystrophic muscle (18-20). Utrophin is also markedly up￾regulated in the dystrophic CXMD myocardium as compared
to the non-dystrophic canine heart (Fig. 3, E and F, respec￾Canine and Murine Fetal Cardiomyocyte Grafts 2037

tively). The virtual absence of immunoreactivity in the non￾dystrophic myocardium suggested that utrophin could be used
as a second, albeit negative, marker for the engrafted cardio￾myocytes. Engrafted regions from a CXMD heart were therefore
examined simultaneously for dystrophin and utrophin expres￾sion using confocal microscopy. Anti-dystrophin immunohistol￾ogy (red signal, Fig. 3 G, arrows) revealed the presence of
a group of engrafted fetal cardiomyocytes. Although utrophin
immunoreactivity was uniformly present in the host myocar￾dium on the same section (green signal, Fig. 3 H), virtually no
immunoreactivity was detected in the dystrophin positive graft
cardiomyocytes (arrows). Visualization of both signals simul￾taneously (Fig. 3 1) confirmed the absence of dystrophin and
utrophin co-localization, which would appear as a yellow signal
in this assay. This observation is consistent with the absence of
utrophin expression in the nondystrophic myocardium, and thus
provides a second marker for the engrafted cardiomyocytes.
Engrafted regions of the CXMD hearts were also examined
for connexin43 expression. Connexin43 is the major constituent
of the cardiac gap junction (21 ). Confocal microscopy revealed
the presence of a host cardiomyocyte aligned longitudinally
between two donor cardiomyocytes, as evidenced by anti-dys￾trophin immunohistology (Fig. 3 D). Connexin43 immunoreac￾tivity was apparent at junctional complexes between the donor
and host cells, suggestive of the presence of coupling. Unfortu￾nately the absence of a suitable histochemical stain for the
canine donor cells precluded ultrastructural assessment of do￾nor-host gap junction formation.
Successful rescue of damaged myocardium will require that
the donor myocytes be seeded at a sufficiently high density
to impact on myocardial function. Experiments were therefore
initiated to estimate the percentage of cells which were dys￾trophin positive at a given site of injection. On average 37% of
the cardiomyocytes in the immediate vicinity of the injection

site displayed dystrophin immunoreactivity (Table I), although
the absolute values varied between individual sites (ranging
from 20% to 60%). Importantly, as many as 168 dystrophin
positive cells could be detected in a single section of an injection
site. Additional experiments indicated that dystrophin positive
grafts could be detected when 104 through 106 donor cardiomy￾ocytes were delivered to a single site (Table II). Furthermore,
the myocardium could readily accommodate multiple injections
of donor cardiomyocytes within a relatively confined area (Ta￾ble II). Optimization of these variables undoubtedly will impact
on the number of cardiomyocytes which can be engrafted at a
given site.
Surface electrocardiographic analysis of engrafted mdx
mice failed to detect overt graft-induced arrhythmias, in
agreement with previous observations (1, 2, 5). However, the
relatively small size and rapid rate of the mouse heart might
render these animals resistant to arrhythmia. In contrast, the
utility of canine models for the assessment of cardiac arrhythmia
is well established (22). Electrocardiographic (ECG) analysis
of each of the engrafted CXMD dogs were therefore performed
immediately prior to sacrifice. Fig. 4 shows a representative
record; this ECG was recorded from the animal sacrificed 10
wk after engraftment. The 12-lead ECG from this animal was
normal, and no premature complexes or conduction distur￾bances were detected. The strip record demonstrated a sinus
rhythm typical for anesthetized dogs (23), indicating that the
presence of fetal cardiomyocyte grafts does not appear to induce
overt arrhythmia in the canine model.
Discussion
Cardiac dysfunction is frequently associated with loss of myo￾cardial mass. The ability to increase the number of functional
cardiomyocytes in a diseased heart would thus have potential
therapeutic value. The experiments presented here demonstrate
that fetal cardiomyocytes can form stable grafts in the adult
canine heart. Engrafted donor cells were observed to be tightly
juxtaposed and well aligned with host cardiomyocytes. Con￾nexin43 immunoreactivity was detected by confocal micros￾copy at junctional complexes between donor and host cells,
indicating (within the limits of the assay) the formation of gap
junctions. The presence of fetal cardiomyocyte grafts did not
induce overt arrhythmia in the canine experiments. Cellular
engraftment can thus successfully augment cardiomyocyte num￾ber in the adult canine heart. Ultrastructural analysis of analo￾gous experiments with mice revealed the presence of complete
intercalated discs between donor and host cardiomyocytes. Col￾lectively, these results raise the possibility that engraftment of
fetal cardiomyocytes might provide a mechanism to augment
myocardial function in large animals.
The canine grafting experiments utilized the dystrophin gene
product as a marker with which to follow the fate of donor
cardiomyocytes. The utility of dystrophin as a cell fate marker
was initially established using donor cells from MHC-nLAC
transgenic mice and dystrophic mdx hosts. All graft cardiomyo￾cytes which exhibited /GAL activity also expressed dystrophin.
Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that some studies have
been hampered by the appearance of dystrophin immunoreactiv￾ity in control dystrophic skeletal and cardiac muscle (9, 24).
It was suggested that the appearance of anti-dystrophin immu￾noreactivity might be due in part to the extreme size of the
dystrophin structural gene. The stochastic accumulation of addi￾tional mutations within the gene, while insufficient to rescue
dystrophin function, might be sufficient to generate a gene prod￾uct recognized by some anti-dystrophin antibodies. Fetal cardio￾myocyte grafts in the CXMD hearts were initially screened with

acid residues 1991-3112). Given the potential caveat of "im￾munoreactive reversions" raised above, graft formation in
CXMD hosts was confirmed on adjacent sections with a second
antibody, DYS 1, a slightly lower affinity anti-dystrophin mono￾clonal antibody which recognizes a different epitope (amino
acid residues 1181-1388). No DYS 1 immunoreactivity was
observed in multiple sections of three control CXMD samples
(Table II). Given the unequivocal nature of the DYS1 control
experiment, the signal observed in experimental animals indis￾putably indicates the presence of engrafted fetal cardiomyo￾cytes. This view was further substantiated by anti-utrophin im￾munohistology, which provided a second, albeit negative,
marker for the engrafted fetal cardiomyocytes.
The results presented here indicate that cellular grafting can
successfully augment cardiomyocyte number in the hearts of
adult dogs. Despite the promise of these initial experiments, a
number of issues must be satisfactorily addressed before the
therapeutic potential of cellular engraftment can be realized.
Clearly the most important caveat is to establish the functional
competence of engrafted cardiomyocytes. Although this issue
was not directly addressed in the current study, evidence sup￾porting the notion that the engrafted cells were functionally
coupled was obtained. Ultrastructural analysis clearly indicated
the presence of complete intercalated discs between host and
donor cardiomyocytes in the murine model. Modification of the
fixation procedure permitted the unambiguous identification of
gap junctions in the current study. Thus the requisite structures
for both action potential and contractile force propagation be￾tween donor and host cardiomyocytes are present in the en￾grafted hearts. The presence of appropriately localized con￾nexin43 immunoreactivity suggested that a similar degree of
physical coupling may also occur in the canine grafts. Importan￾tly, graft cardiomyocyte sarcomeres were observed to be aligned
and in register with those in host cardiomyocytes, consistent
with their participation in a functional syncytium. Definitive
assessment of functional coupling between donor and host
cardiomyocytes will be dependent upon the localization of do￾nor cardiomyocytes with a vital dye which can be exploited in
conjunction with electrophysiologic and/or contractile assays.
Unfortunately, none of the vital ,6GAL dyes tested worked suf￾ficiently well with intact live tissue to enable us to identify
engrafted regions.
Several other issues must be addressed when considering
the potential of therapeutic cellular grafting. The current study
demonstrated that fetal cardiomyocyte grafts did not induce
overt cardiac arrhythmia in the canine model. Indeed, 12 lead
ECGs recorded from engrafted animals were indistinguishable
from controls. Although previous studies failed to detect graft￾induced arrhythmia in murine experiments (5), the significance
of those observations was equivocal given the relative resistance
of this species to arrhythmogenic episodes. The absence of con￾duction abnormalities in engrafted canine hearts is thus an im￾portant observation. Despite this favorable preliminary result,
additional experiments are needed to determine if the graft￾myocardium border acts as a predisposing substrate for arrhyth￾mia. Long term screening with Holter monitors would provide
additional information regarding any arrhythmogenic propen￾sity resulting from the grafting procedure.
As indicated above, successful rescue of damaged myocar￾dium will require donor myocyte seeding at a sufficiently high
density to impact on myocardial function. Although relatively
high seeding densities were observed in the present study (an
average value of 37% was obtained, see Table I), quantitative
morphometric analyses to ascertain the absolute graft area were
not performed. Prudence dictates that the variables which ulti￾mately will impact upon donor cell seeding density be addressed
prior to the initiation of comprehensive morphometric studies.
Towards that end, initial studies indicated that varying either
the number of cells per injection or the number of injections
per unit area did not negatively affect the ability to form grafts.
2040 Koh et al.

Additional experiments aimed at refining these variables will
undoubtedly result in optimization of the ensuing graft size. It
is nonetheless encouraging to note that grafts spanning as much
as 2 mm of the host myocardium were observed in the present
study. Although the number of injections per unit area which
the myocardium can tolerate remains to be established, human
skeletal muscle has tolerated an array of 100 injections in a 24
cm2 area (9). If optimization of the myocardial injection proto￾col resulted in the consistent generation of grafts in excess of
2 mm, delivery of donor cardiomyocytes in a similar array might
significantly impact on cardiac function. Without knowledge of
the ultimate number of injections per unit area required for
functional augmentation, one cannot predict what conditions
may be treatable by intracardiac grafting. In the case of global
cardiomyopathies, effective treatment of the entire heart may
not be feasible. However localized treatment might be useful
in cases such as myocardial infarction, where the diseased tissue
is regionally restricted.
Another important consideration is the availability of suit￾able donor cells. Although difficulties may be encountered in
procuring sufficient numbers of primary human fetal cells for
engraftment, amplification of fetal cardiomyocyte explants in
vitro might facilitate the banking of donor cells. Such ap￾proaches would be dependent upon the continued identification
and functional analysis of cardiomyocyte cell cycle regulatory
proteins (reviewed in 28), as well as exploitation of currently
available in vitro gene transfer techniques. Identification of the
cardiomyocyte lineage determining gene(s) could provide an
alternative source of donor cardiomyocytes (reviewed in 29).
Transfection of one (or several) determining genes into an ap￾propriately permissive cell may result in the genesis of donor
cardiomyocytes in vitro (as is currently possible for skeletal
myogenesis). Cardiogenic induction is also possible with em￾bryonic stem cells isolated from mice (30), rats and rabbits.
Generation of an equivalent human cell line would provide
yet another source of potential donor cells. Chronic immune
suppression would likely be required to maintain most types of
intracardiac grafts, as is currently required for whole organ
transplant.
The apparent plasticity of the dystrophic myocardium de￾serves comment. The degree of donor cell integration in both
the mdx and CXMD models appeared superior to that observed
previously with non-dystrophic hosts (5). Although this obser￾vation is presently only phenomenological in nature, it is none￾theless important to consider to what extent the absence of
dystrophin may influence donor cardiomyocyte integration.
Dystrophin is thought to provide a link between the myocyte
actin cytoskeleton and the extracellular environment. Since dys￾trophin is localized along the cytoplasmic face of the plasma
membrane (reviewed in 25), extracellular linkage would re￾quire the participation of a membrane spanning structure. The
dystrophin-glycoprotein complex, a structure comprised of five
dystrophin-associated proteins (26), is thought to provide link￾age between dystrophin and the extracellular matrix. Expression
of these dystrophin-associated proteins is markedly reduced in
dystrophic muscle from Duchenne patients, mdx mice and
CXMD dogs (reviewed in 27). Given that the dystrophin-glyco￾protein complex undoubtedly influences myocyte-matrix inter￾actions (and by extension myocyte-myocyte interaction), the
apparent superior integration of donor cells in the mdx and
CXMD myocardium might simply reflect intrinsic differences
in cell-cell and/or cell-extracellular matrix interactions in dys￾trophic versus normal myocardium.
In summary, the experiments reported here establish that
fetal cardiomyocyte grafting can readily be extended to the
canine myocardium, and that the presence of intracardiac grafts
does not overtly disrupt the normal autonomic function of the
host heart. Additional experiments are required to optimize graft
size and to establish the presence of functional donor-host cou￾pling in the canine model. Once these goals are realized, the
efficacy of fetal cardiomyocyte engraftment in a diseased myo￾cardium can be examined rationally.
