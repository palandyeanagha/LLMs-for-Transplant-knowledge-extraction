Introduction
In the last twenty years, bronchoscopy (FBS)
has undergone very significant developments with
an amplification of the procedures which have be￾come increasingly complex and invasive, without
strong evidence of the possible increase in the in￾cidence and type of complications.
There have been very few studies carried out
on this topic. In 1974 Creedle [1] published the
first retrospective study of the complications that
occur in bronchoscopy, conducted by means of a
questionnaire sent to 250 pneumology specialists.
Among those interviewed, 78% replied, a sample
of 24,521 bronchoscopies was collected, showing
a mortality rate of 0.1% and an incidence of com￾plications greater than 0.8%. In 1976 Suratt [2]
published a very similar study with a lower per￾centage of replies from those interviewed (31% of
1041 questionnaires sent out) but obtaining a sam￾ple of 48,000 bronchoscopies. The mortality was
found to be 0.03% and the complications were
more than 0.3%. In 1978, Pereira [3] published the
first multicentre prospective study on a sample of
908 patients, recording a mortality of 0.1% and in￾cidence of complications equal to 1.7%. Other au￾thors reported higher percentages of incidence, for
retrospective studies, like Dreisin [4] who reported
a mortality of 0.5% and an incidence of complica￾tions greater than and less than 5 and 6%, respec￾tively, for 205 procedures, while Burger [5] report￾ed an incidence of hemorrhages and pneumothorax

Aim. To evaluate the frequency of complications in bron￾choscopy from data compiled between 1/2/2002 to 1/2/2003.
Materials and methods. Nineteen Italian centres of
thoracic endoscopy participated in the study, for a total of
20,986 bronchoscopies (FBS), including 10,658 explorative
bronchoscopies (EB) (50.79%), 5,520 bronchial biopsies
(BB) (26.30%), 1,660 transbronchial biopsies (TBB)
(7.91%), 1,127 broncho-alveolar lavages (BAL) (5.37%),
930 transbronchial needle-aspirates (TBNA) (4.43%),
1.091 therapeutic bronchoscopies (TB), comprising ND￾YAG Laser, argon-plasma, electrocautery knife, stent in￾sertion (5.20%). 82.4% of the procedures involved the use
of a flexible bronchoscope, 16.3% were carried out using
a rigid bronchoscope and 1.3% using the mixed technique.
Results. The total number of complications recorded
was 227 (1.08% of the cases examined), including 20
(0.09%) during local anesthesia and pre-medication, 195
(0.92%) during the endoscopic procedures and 12 (0.05%)
in the two hours following FBS. The total number of
deaths was 4 (0.02%), due to cardiac arrest, pulmonary
edema, delayed respiratory failure and shock in pre-med￾ication, respectively. 68.28% of the complications were
treated medically, 25.99% by means of endoscopy and
5.72% with surgery. The healing percentage was 98.2%.
Conclusions. This study has shown that bronchoscopy
is a safe method with low incidence of mortality and com￾plications. The preparation, experience and continuous
training of the operators of the medical and nursing team
seem to play a fundamental role in reducing the incidence
of complications at least in certain procedures such as BB
and TBB.

INCIDENCE OF COMPLICATIONS IN BRONCHOSCOPY MULTICENTRE PROSPECTIVE STUDY OF 20,986 BRONCHOSCOPIES
equal to 30.2% on a sample of 78 patients subject￾ed to transbronchial biopsy. Sympson [6] and
Smyth [7] published two surveys on the habits of
British endoscopists, where the data for incidence
of complications and mortality reported was
0.12% and 0.04%, respectively.
Materials and methods
We designed a prospective multicentre study to
evaluate the real incidence of complications in
Bronchoscopy (FBS) and the type in relation to all
the new diagnostic and therapeutic methods. The
study was conducted during the period from
01/02/2002 to 01/02/2003. Nineteen Italian en￾doscopy centres participated in the study by com￾piling a chart via the website with access reserved
for each participating centre by means of a pass￾word. The chart contained general information re￾garding the centres, the diagnostic procedures, the
number and type of complication that occurred. The
chart proposed was validated by the Interventional
Pneumology study team of the Italian Association
of Hospital Pneumologists (AIPO). The procedures
and the complications were coded for better statisti￾cal processing and to facilitate data entry. We de￾fined a “complication” as any adverse event direct￾ly correlated with the endoscopic procedure per￾formed. The complications were classified as: com￾plications that occurred during the preparation for
the examination (local anesthesia and pre-medica￾tion, if any), complications that occurred during the
endoscopic procedure and the delayed complica￾tions that occurred within 2 hours of the end of the
procedure. We defined the oxyhaemoglobin desatu￾ration during the bronchoscopy procedure as a 6
point percentage drop in the oxyhaemoglobin satu￾ration from that recorded at the beginning of the
procedure. We define haemorrhage as bleeding
caused by procedure. We distinguish: mild haemor￾rhage < 50 ml and severe haemorrhage > 50 ml.
The data was recorded in a database (AC￾CESS-OFFICE 2000- Microsoft inc.) and statisti￾cal analysis was carried out using the SPSS ver￾sion 15.0 program. The sample was divided into
two categories: the first group of explorative bron￾choscopies which involves only endoscopic explo￾ration and broncho-aspirates without other inter￾ventional procedures; the second group of non-ex￾plorative bronchoscopies which comprises endo￾scopic exploration associated with interventional
procedures like bronchial biopsies (BB), trans￾bronchial biopsies (TBB), transbronchial needle
aspirates (TBNA), broncho-alveolar lavage
(BAL), therapeutic bronchoscopies (TB) (Nd Yag
laser, argon plasma, stent positioning, electro￾cautery etc.). The descriptive analysis was carried
out only on the non explorative bronchoscopies
group, dividing the participating centres on the ba￾sis of the number of examinations done, to obtain
three groups: the 1st group of 0-500 FBS (3 cen￾tres); 2nd group of 501-1000 FBS (6 centres); 3rd
group > 1000 FBS (9 centres).
A further analysis was carried out, stratifying
the centres on the basis of the type and number of
interventional procedures performed, to obtain
three homogeneous groups depending on the num￾ber of procedures. This resulted in the following
groups: BB - 1st group 0-200 (7 centres), 2nd group
201- 400 (5 centres), 3rd group > 400 (6 centres).
TBB - 1st group 0-100 (10 centres), 2nd group 101-
200 (6 centres), 3rd group > 200 (2 centres). TB -
1st group 0-50 (12 centres), 2nd group 50-100 (3
centres), 3rd group > 100 (3 centres). TBNA - 1st
group 0-50 (11 centres), 2nd group 50-100 (3 cen￾tres), 3rd group > 100 (4 centres). BAL - 1st group
0-100(13 centres), 2nd group 100-200 (5 centres).
We compared the incidence and type of complica￾tion encountered in the groups listed above, calcu￾lating the statistical significance by means of the
Pearson’s chi-square test. The results with a p < 0.05
are considered as significant.
Results
The analysed sample consisted of 20,986 en￾doscopic procedures comprising 10,658 explo￾rative FBS (ESP) (50.79%), 10,328 non explo￾rative FBS divided as follows: 5,520 bronchial
biopsies (BB) (26.30%), 1,660 transbronchial
biopsies (TBB) (7.91%), 1,127 broncho-alveolar
lavages (BAL) (5.37%), 930 transbronchial aspi￾rating needles (TBNA) (4.43%), 1,091 Therapeu￾tic bronchoscopies (TB) (5.20%) comprising ND￾YAG Laser, Argon-plasma, Electrocautery, Stent
positioning. The number of procedures performed
in local anesthesia was 19,458 (92.72%), while
those in general anesthesia were 1,528 (7.28%).
The complications that occurred in relation to
the endoscopic examinations were found to be 227
(1.08% of the total of the procedures) (tab. 1) di￾vided into: 20 during anesthesia and pre-medica￾tion phase (0.095%), 195 during the endoscopic
procedure (0.92%), 12 within two hours following
FBS (0.05%). Thirteen patients had two complica￾tions while one patient had three complications.
Four mortal complications (0.02%) were reported
and the causes were: 1 cardiac failure (during the
course of Laser treatment), 1 pulmonary edema
(during the course of Laser treatment), 1 delayed
respiratory failure (laser treatment with prosthesis
positioning) and 1 shock in pre-medication (candi￾date for laser treatment).
In 187 cases (82.4%) a flexible bronchoscope
was used, in 37 cases (16.3%) a rigid broncho￾scope was used, while the mixed technique (rigid
+ flexible) (1.3%) was used in three cases. In 186
cases local anesthesia was used (81.9%), in 51
cases (27.41%) Atropine was used for pre-medica￾tion, while general anesthesia was used in 41 cas￾es (18.1%). 98.7% of the patients who suffered
complications were monitored using pulse oxyme￾try, 30.0% with ECG and 37.0% with arterial pres￾sure monitoring.
The four most common complications were:
haemorrhage in 93 cases (41%) followed by 25
cases (11.0%) of oxyhaemoglobin desaturation, 22
cases (9.77%) of pneumothorax and 14 cases
(6.22%) of pulmonary edema. In relation to the
type of procedure the diagnostic procedure most

affected by complications is found to be TBB
(3.43%), while the one least affected by complica￾tions is explorative bronchoscopy 0.43% (tab. 2).
In therapeutic bronchoscopy, we found a 2.84% in￾cidence of complications.
The percentage distribution of complications
in relation to the procedures is shown in table 3.

number of complications, after eliminating 20 pre￾procedure complications (4 for explorative and 16
for non explorative), there is a high statistical sig￾nificance (p < 0.001) between the presence of
complications and non explorative FBS.
A high statistical significance (p < 0,001) is al￾so seen between the presence of complications and
the TBB and therapeutic bronchoscopy procedures
(tab. 4).
The group of centres which perform > 1,000
FBS per year reported a greater frequency of com￾plications as compared to the other two (p < 0.0007).
The relationship between the number of inci￾dences of complications and the type of interven￾tional procedure showed a higher incidence of
complications in the group of centres with the
number of procedures between 201-400 for BB 
(p < 0.009) and in the group of centres with the
number of procedures between 0-100 for TBB (p <
0.002) (tab. 4). For the groups of centres compared
for the other interventional procedures (TBNA,
BAL, TB) no statistically significant differences
were observed in relation to the distribution of the

ment was ‘medical’ for 68.28%, ‘endoscopic’ for
25.99% and ‘surgical’ for 5.72%. The healing per￾centage was 98.2%.
Discussion
We conducted a prospective observational
study with the aim of evaluating the number of in￾cidence of complications in bronchoscopy in the
light of all the new methods developed in the di￾agnostic as well as the therapeutic fields of bron￾choscopy.
The overall incidence of complications was
found to be 1.08% with a mortality of 0.02%. Con￾sidering the range of the sample and the complex
nature of the endoscopic procedures examined, it
may be stated that bronchoscopy, both diagnostic
and therapeutic, is a safe method. The mortality
recorded, confirming the data already published
[6-12], is extremely low. The complications that
occurred during the preparation phase for the ex￾amination were 20 (0.09%). There are reports in
literature of allergic, neurological, cardiovascular
and respiratory complications in the pre-medica￾tion and anesthesia phase, and these were partly re￾lated to the dose of the drug used for the anesthe￾sia or to the drugs used for sedation [13]. Actually
there is no standardisation of the type of pre-med￾ication to be used when a bronchoscopy is to be
performed [14-15], and in our study too, each par￾ticipating centre adopted its own protocol. This
made it very difficult for us to attempt a statistical
correlation between the administration of drugs in
pre-medication and the onset of complications,
thus highlighting the importance and the need for
studies for comparison of the various protocols for
preparation of the patients for the endoscopic ex￾aminations which make it possible to draw defini￾tive conclusions regarding its danger potential as
well as the capacity to prevent complications. A
recent publication showed that the application of
guidelines in thoracic endoscopic in daily practice
can induce a reduction of the incidence of compli￾cations [16]; so it is hoped that a shared protocol
will be applied. The most frequent complications
were haemorrhage, pneumothorax, oxyhaemoglo￾bin desaturation and pulmonary edema. Haemor￾rhage is confirmed as the most frequent and seri￾ous [17] event; no mortal cases were reported, and
all were treated successfully, 58.06% with endo￾scopic therapy and 41.93% with medical treat￾ment.
Of the interventional procedures, TBB was
found to be the procedure with the highest number
of complications, three times higher than BB and
TBNA, and six times higher than BAL and explo￾rative bronchoscopies; this data appears to be in
agreement with the data present in literature [18-
21]. There were 22 cases of pneumothorax, treated
with thoracic drainage in 59.09% of the cases ac￾cording to the indications of the British Thoracic
Society [22-23]. The third complication in the or￾der of frequency was oxyhaemoglobin desatura￾tion. There are a number of causes which con￾tribute to the onset of desaturation, from severe al￾teration of the ventilation-perfusion ratio, hy￾poventilation linked to sedation, increased resis￾tance due to the introduction of the bronchoscope
in the trachea, the onset of bronchospasm and/or
inappropriate aspiration movements by the opera￾tor [24]. It is vitally important to promptly high￾light this event; monitoring using the pulse
oxymeter is necessary to immediately highlight
this dangerous complication and it must be applied
to all patients subjected to bronchoscopy [25-26].
The data of our study highlighted the need for
great attention to be paid by endoscopists in mon￾itoring patients during bronchoscopy.
One of the aims of our study was to evaluate
the distribution of the incidence of complications
with respect to the features of the participating
centres, stratified by the number of FBS performed
and the type of interventional procedures.
The first result to be recorded was the low in￾cidence of complications in the explorative bron￾choscopy group (i.e. carried out without sampling

and without any therapeutic purpose), which high￾lights their substantial safety, while there is a high
incidence of complications (p < 0.001) in the
group of non explorative bronchoscopies associat￾ed with interventional procedures (TBB, BB,
BAL, TBNA, TB). The statistical evaluation of the
distribution of the complications in relation to the
type of procedure confirmed a high statistical sig￾nificance in TBB and TB which must be consid￾ered as high-risk procedures (p < 0.001). The study
revealed a high statistical significance in the group
of centres which perform > 1,000 (p = 0.007) bron￾choscopies. It is logical to think that this group is
naturally exposed to the risk of a larger number of
complications since it probably treated cases that
were more complex and/or with serious co-mor￾bidity. However, a more detailed analysis showed
a strong lack of uniformity of performance within
this group. In order to homogenise the sample, we
further stratified the centres on the basis of the
number and type of interventional procedures per￾formed by each. An evaluation of the groups di￾vided by the number of BB with step 200 shows
that a larger number of complications is associated
with the second group (step 201-400) p < 0.009.
How can this data be interpreted?
The centres which perform fewer BB general￾ly face simpler problems and usually work with a
single bronchoscopist. It is reasonable to think that
in intermediate centres with a larger number of
procedures, a number of operators are involved
who face more complex pathologies on an average
but who, individually, perform a smaller number
of biopsies. It may be hypothesised that the num￾ber of operators, the number of procedures per￾formed by the individual and therefore their expe￾rience and training play a fundamental role in the
greater incidence of complications. In the third
group, the number of BB performed individually
by the operators is higher, providing them with
sufficient experience and training to reduce the
number of complications to the minimum. This
theory seems to be confirmed also by the results of
the comparison of the groups with TBB. In the
TBB group, the complications are associated with
a highly significant frequency in the first group (p
< 0.002, step 0-100) indicating that the complica￾tions are associated with that group of centres
which perform fewer TBB. Considering that the
execution technique is now standardised, the inde￾pendent variable may be represented by the opera￾tor’s skill and experience because of the large
number of procedures performed.
The study showed that only 0.05% of compli￾cations appeared at a later stage (within 2 hours af￾ter bronchoscopy) and all of them following diag￾nostic procedures. This extremely low percentage
highlights the safety of diagnostic bronchoscopy
which therefore does not require hospitalisation
but a sufficient period of post-operative observa￾tion and clear information regarding the possibili￾ty of onset of complications [27-29].
In conclusion, this study shows that bron￾choscopy is a safe method with an extremely low
incidence of mortality in the diagnostic and thera￾peutic phase. The experience and training of the
operators may be an important variable in reducing
the incidence of complications at least for certain
procedures like BB and TB and the patients must
be provided with the best possible conditions to
face the procedure [30-31]. To date, no systematic
studies have been conducted which relate the indi￾vidual risk factors and the probability of the onset
of complications; we hope further studies will be
conducted in order to establish a correlation be￾tween the complications and the risk class of the
patients.
