Abstract
Background: COVID-19 restrictions such as the closure of schools and parks, and the cancellation of youth sports
and activity classes around the United States may prevent children from achieving recommended levels of physical
activity (PA). This study examined the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on PA and sedentary behavior (SB) in U.S.
children.
Method: Parents and legal guardians of U.S. children (ages 5–13) were recruited through convenience sampling
and completed an online survey between April 25–May 16, 2020. Measures included an assessment of their child’s
previous day PA and SB by indicating time spent in 11 common types of PA and 12 common types of SB for
children. Parents also reported perceived changes in levels of PA and SB between the pre-COVID-19 (February 2020)
and early-COVID-19 (April–May 2020) periods. Additionally, parents reported locations (e.g., home/garage, parks/
trails, gyms/fitness centers) where their children had performed PA and their children’s use of remote/streaming
services for PA.
Results: From parent reports, children (N = 211) (53% female, 13% Hispanic, Mage = 8.73 [SD = 2.58] years)
represented 35 states and the District of Columbia. The most common physical activities during the early-COVID-19
period were free play/unstructured activity (e.g., running around, tag) (90% of children) and going for a walk (55%
of children). Children engaged in about 90 min of school-related sitting and over 8 h of leisure-related sitting a day.
Parents of older children (ages 9–13) vs. younger children (ages 5–8) perceived greater decreases in PA and greater
increases in SB from the pre- to early-COVID-19 periods. Children were more likely to perform PA at home indoors
or on neighborhood streets during the early- vs. pre-COVID-19 periods. About a third of children used remote/
streaming services for activity classes and lessons during the early-COVID-19 period.
Conclusion: Short-term changes in PA and SB in reaction to COVID-19 may become permanently entrenched,
leading to increased risk of obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease in children. Programmatic and policy
strategies should be geared towards promoting PA and reducing SB over the next 12 months.

Background
In March 2020, the respiratory disease caused by the
SARS-Cov-2 virus, COVID-19, was declared a pandemic by
the World Health Organization and a national emergency
in the United States of America (U.S.). To date (Aug. 14,
2020), there had been 5.27 million COVID-19 cases and
167,000 related deaths recorded by the U.S. Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention [1]. To prevent the spread
of COVID-19, state and local governments enacted numer￾ous restrictions on human movement and physical interac￾tions. Starting mid-March, primary and secondary schools
closed in all 50 states with many states extending school
closures through the end of the 2019–2020 school year [2,
3]. As a result, children no longer had access to school￾based physical activities such as physical education, recess,
and walking to/from school. Youth team sports leagues
cancelled all practices and games through May 2020 in
most U.S. states with many states continuing these cancel￾lations throughout the summer. Fitness and activity classes
for youth such as gymnastics, dance, and martial arts were
also cancelled or postponed through mid-May or later. Fed￾eral, state, and local public parks, playground, trails, and
beaches were closed in many jurisdictions starting mid-to￾late March with some re-openings occurring in late April
through mid-May. Although these social-distancing mea￾sures were necessary to slow the spread of COVID-19, they
may have limited children’s ability to engage in sufficient
levels of physical activity (PA) to maintain health and pre￾vent disease.
Promoting adequate levels of PA in children is a major
public health issue. Recent estimates suggest approxi￾mately three-quarters of U.S. children and youth be￾tween the ages of 6 and 15 years fail to meet the 2018
Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans recommen￾dation of at least 60 min of moderate-to-vigorous phys￾ical activity (MVPA) per day [4]. Additionally, nearly
half of U.S. children and youth between the ages of 6
and 11 years engage in two or more hours of screen time
per day–a level of behavior greater than recommended
levels put forth by the American Academy of Pediatrics
[5]. Insufficient PA and excessive sedentary behavior
(SB) among children represents a significant problem
because health behavior patterns in childhood are likely
to persist into adulthood and can lead to increased risk
for a number of serious health conditions (e.g., over￾weight/obesity, type II diabetes, and metabolic syn￾drome) in later childhood and adulthood [6].
It is unclear how COVID-19 related closures, cancella￾tions, and restrictions have impacted PA participation
among U.S. children. The cancellation of youth sports
and activity classes have inspired programs, coaches, in￾dependent fitness professionals, and other entities to
offer online streaming services with live or recorded
sports/activity classes for youth using platforms such as
Zoom, YouTube, Instagram, and proprietary mobile ap￾plications. Furthermore, without the structure of school
or demands of after-school lessons and classes, some
children may have more time for physically active free
play at home. However, there may be enormous dispar￾ities in access to these opportunities based on household
financial considerations, digital technology access, house
and yard size, and neighborhood safety and traffic vol￾ume [7–11]. It has been argued COVID-19 school closures
will lead to increased rates of obesity in children [12, 13] in part
because schools provide opportunities and facilities for physical
activity through physical education and recess [14–16]. Al￾though policies vary, many states require between 90 and 150
min per week of physical activity during the school day [16, 17].
As a result of these policies, children typically engage in lower
levels of PA and more sedentary time on weekend days as com￾pared to school days [18, 19]. Also, children tend to gain more
weight over the summer, especially children who are not en￾rolled in structured summer camps and activities [20–23]. If
COVID-19 school closures and sport team/activity class cancel￾lations lasting a year or more result in similar inactivity patterns
that are typically seen on weekend days and during the sum￾mer, there may be enormous consequences for children’s over￾all physical health.
Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate
the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on PA and SB in
U.S. children (ages 5–13 years) during the spring of
2020. The first objective was to examine differences in
children’s PA and SB during the early-COVID-19 period
(April–May 2020) by child sex and age. The second ob￾jective was to examine parent-reported changes in these
behaviors from the pre-COVID-19 period (February
2020) to the early-COVID-19 period by child sex and
age. The third objective was to investigate changes in
the locations of children’s PA between the pre-COVID￾19 period and the early-COVID-19 period by child sex
and age. An ancillary goal was to examine rates of the
use of remote and streaming services for PA by child sex
and age. Given the potential for increased risk of obesity,
diabetes, and other chronic diseases in children due to
prolonged physical inactivity, information about the im￾pact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children’s PA can
inform immediate programmatic and policy efforts dur￾ing the next few months of the pandemic.
Methods
Study design
A prospective survey design assessed the effects of the
COVID-19 pandemic on PA among U.S. children by
using online parent-reported surveys. A baseline online
survey was completed between April 25 – May 16, 2020,
and a second online survey is scheduled to occur within
6–12 months. The current analyses focus on data col￾lected from the baseline online survey.

Recruitment and participants
A convenience sampling strategy, focused on recruiting a
general population of parents living in the U.S. during the
COVID-19 pandemic, was utilized. To avoid in-person in￾teractions, potential respondents were electronically in￾vited through various social media platforms (e.g.,
Facebook, Twitter) and university-based email list servs of
students, faculty, and staff. Inclusion criteria were as fol￾lows: 18 years or older, able to speak and read English, live
in the U.S., is a parent or legal guardian of a child between
the ages of 5–13, greater than or equal to 50% of child’s
custody resides with the parent/legal guardian, and
planned parental custody for the next 12 months. Individ￾uals were directed to an online screening form directly
from an email or social media post. Once eligibility was
determined, individuals agreed to participate through an
anonymous online information sheet describing the study
procedures, risks, and benefits. The Institutional Review
Board of the University of Southern California determined
the study procedures presented no more than minimal
risk and approved it as exempt from full review.
Procedures
Participants completed the online screening form, infor￾mation sheet, and baseline survey in English through an
online survey platform, Research Electronic Data Capture,
which conforms to HIPAA security requirements for the
protection of data [24, 25]. Baseline data collection took
place over 22 days (April 25 – May 16, 2020). The baseline
survey took approximately 20 min to complete. Partici￾pants had the option to complete it either on their mobile
phone, tablet, or desktop device. Each parent reported on
one child of theirs who was between ages 5–13. If a parent
had more than one child between ages 5–13, they were
asked to only report on the one child whose birthday oc￾curred next chronologically after the date the survey was
administered. Upon completion of the baseline survey,
participants were eligible to be entered into a lottery to
win one of ten $50 gift cards.
Measures
The current analyses utilized data on child’s past day PA
and SB, parents’ perceived changes in level of PA and
sitting time, locations of child’s PA, child’s use of re￾mote/streaming services, and demographics.
Children’s physical activity and sedentary behavior
Parents completed a measure of their child’s previous
day PA created for the purposes of capturing non-school
based activities frequently occurring during COVID-19,
modeled upon the structure and format of previous day
PA measures used in youth [26]. Parents also completed
a measure of their child’s previous day SB with an in￾strument used in the “Active Where” survey [27]. The
instructions asked parents to indicate how much time
on the previous day their child performed each from a
list of 11 types of common non-school-based PA and 12
common types of non-school-based SB for children.
They were asked to think about the time that their child
was awake on the previous day. The SB instrument has
demonstrated acceptable intraclass correlations and test￾retest reliability in previous research [27]. The specific
types of PA included: sports practice or training; activity
classes/lessons; free play or unstructured PA; jogging or
running; biking; scootering, skateboarding, or roller skat￾ing; swimming; going for a walk; circuit training or con￾ditioning; weightlifting, or other (write-in). Types of SB
included: watching television, videos, or movies; playing
computer or video games; using the internet, emailing,
or other electronic media for leisure; doing school￾related video calls; doing video calls; doing school￾related work; sitting while listening to music; sitting
while talking on the telephone or texting; sitting while
hanging out or talking with friends or family in person;
reading a book or magazine NOT for school; doing in￾active hobbies; and riding or driving in a car. Duration
in each activity was reported. After completing the mea￾sures, parents were asked to indicate how similar their
child’s level of PA or sitting YESTERDAY, respectively,
was compared to the past 7 days.
The Youth Compendium of Physical Activities (Youth
Compendium) was utilized as a guide to calculate meta￾bolic equivalents (METs) for each of the 11 types of PA.
METy values for the age group 6–9 were applied for chil￾dren who were 5 years old. If the type of PA in the base￾line survey was not explicitly stated in the Youth
Compendium, the METy values for the activity that most
closely resembled the type of PA were used (e.g., the
METy values for “jumping jacks” were utilized for the sur￾vey item “circuit training/conditioning). Five items on the
survey were not explicitly stated in the Youth Compen￾dium. If a participant wrote in an activity for ‘other’,
METy values were inputted for each individual case. To
calculate MET-minutes (MET-mins) for each of the types
of PA, each age-group specific mean METy value was
multiplied by the number of minutes parents reported
their child performed in the previous day. Daily total
MET-mins of PA were calculated for each child by taking
the sum of MET-mins across the 11 specific types of PA.
Children’s previous day sitting/SB was examined by
calculating the minutes spent in each of the 12 types of
SB. Daily total minutes of SB were calculated for each
child by taking the sum of minutes across the 12 types
of SB. If the daily total minutes exceeded 1080 min, the
value was truncated to 1080 min to address outliers.
Daily total minutes of SB was also separated into two
categories: minutes of school-related sitting (i.e., doing
school-related video calls and doing school-related work)
Dunton et al. BMC Public Health (2020) 20:1351 Page 3 of 13

and minutes of sitting for leisure (i.e., all other types
listed in the baseline survey).
Perceived changes in children’s levels of physical activity
and sedentary behavior
Parents were asked to compare their child’s current
levels of PA (i.e., past 7 days) and SB to the pre-COVID￾19 period (i.e., February 2020). Specifically, they were
asked, “Compared to Feb 2020, how physically active has
your child been/how much sitting has your child been
doing in the PAST 7 DAYS?” Response options were re￾ported on a 5-point likert scale ranging from a “much
more physically active in past 7 days as compared to
February 2020,” to “much less physically active in past 7
days as compared to February 2020.”
Locations of children’s physical activity
Parents were asked to report the types of locations in
which their child did PA in February 2020 and over the
past 7 days (i.e., “where did your child do physical activ￾ity?”) with instructions to choose all that apply from the
following options: inside my home or garage, in my yard
or driveway, on the sidewalks and roads in my neighbor￾hood, on the sidewalks and roads outside my neighbor￾hood, gym or fitness center, at a park or trail, at an
indoor sports facility (e.g., basketball/tennis court, ice
rink), or at an outdoor sports facility (e.g., basketball/
tennis court, baseball diamond). These settings were
based upon locations assessed in the “Active Where”
survey [28, 29] and correspond to where children fre￾quently engage in physical activity based upon Global
Positioning Systems (GPS) [30].
Children’s use of remote/streaming services for physical
activity
Parents reported whether their child used remote or
streaming services to participate in PA during the during
the early-COVID-19 period. Specifically, they were asked,
on how many days of the past 7 days did their child par￾ticipate in any team sports training sessions or practices,
activity classes or lessons classes or sessions provided by a
health club or gym through remote services, such as
streaming classes via the internet or mobile applications.
Demographics
Parents reported on their child’s biological sex at birth
(male vs. female), birthdate, grade in school, ethnicity
(Hispanic vs. non-Hispanic), and race (coded as American
Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black, Native Hawaiian or
Pacific Islander, White, Mixed race, Other). Parents also
reported on their own birthdate, gender, marital status
(coded as married vs. not married), employment status
(coded as works full-time vs. does not work full-time), and
annual household income (categorized as less than $24,
999, $25,000–$54,999, $55,000–$94,999, $95,000 or
more). All survey questions allowed participants to choose
the option ‘do not know/prefer not to answer’.
Statistical analyses
Prior to data analyses, variables were screened for viola￾tions of statistical assumptions (e.g., normality, linearity).
Variables representing the duration of participation in
specific types of physical activities were highly skewed
due to the substantial number of children who did not
perform any type of activity. Therefore, these variables
were coded as some vs. none for subsequent analyses.
The total MET-min PA variable, and all the SB variables
(i.e., specific types, total sitting minutes, minutes of
school-related sitting, minutes of sitting for leisure) were
also positively skewed and thus subjected to square root
transformations. To test the first objective, chi-square
and independent samples t-tests compared rates and
means for participation in the specific types of PA and
SB during the early-COVID-19 period (April – May
2020), respectively, by child sex (male vs. female) and
child age group (5–8 years vs. 9–13 years). Multiple lin￾ear regression analyses further examined whether child
sex and age predicted total MET-min, total sitting mi￾nutes, minutes of school-related sitting, minutes of sit￾ting for leisure) after controlling for child ethnicity
(Hispanic vs. non-Hispanic), parent employment status
(works full-time vs. does not work full-time), parent
marital status (married vs. not married), and annual
household income. To test the second objective, ordinal
logistic regression models examined whether child sex
and age predicted the likelihood of parents perceiving
changes (i.e., much more, somewhat more, about the
same, somewhat less, much less) in PA and SB between
the pre-COVID-19 period (February 2020) and early￾COVID-19 period (April–May 2020) after adjusting for
the same demographic covariates listed in the first
objective. The third objective was tested by using gener￾alized estimating equations (GEE) to examine within￾subject changes in the likelihood of children engaging in
PA at various locations differed by child sex and age
group. The within-subject factor was Time (i.e., pre￾COVID-19 vs. early-COVID-19), the between-subject
factors were child sex and age group, and covariates in￾cluded child ethnicity (Hispanic vs. non-Hispanic), par￾ent employment status (works full-time vs. does not
work full-time), parent marital status (married vs. not
married), and annual household income. Interactions
were tested for Time × Child sex and Time × Child age
group. To address the ancillary goal of examining
whether the likelihood of children engaging in some vs.
none for each of three types of PA remote and streaming
services (i.e., team sports, activity classes and lessons,
classes offered by gym) also differed by child sex and age
Dunton et al. BMC Public Health (2020) 20:1351 Page 4 of 13

group, logistic regressions were conducted controlling
for the covariates used in the above models.
Results
Data availability and demographic characteristics
A total of 325 parents expressed interest in the study
and completed the screening questions. Of this number,
n = 41 individuals were not eligible. Twenty-seven indi￾viduals were no longer interested in the study after com￾pleting the online screening form, and 257 individuals
agreed to participate in the study. Thirty-one cases were
removed that had not yet completed the baseline survey
at the time of data analysis, and 14 participants were
missing data on child PA and SB, leaving an analytic
sample size of 211. Additional participants were missing
data on demographic variables, but they were retained in
the analytic sample and treated with pairwise deletion.
Table 1 shows the descriptive statistics for the demo￾graphic characteristics of the analytic sample. Individuals
resided across 35 U.S. states and the District of
Columbia. Parents ranged in age from 20 to 61 years,
with an average age of 42.05 years (SD = 5.34). Children’s
ages ranged from 5 to 13 years, with an average age of
8.71 years (SD = 2.58). Most parents who participated
were mothers, identified as non-Hispanic, and had grad￾uated from college. About half of the children reported
on in the study were female and the majority were non￾Hispanic. Over half of parents reported working full￾time. Over half of the sample reported an annual
household income of $95,000 or more.
Children’s physical activity and sedentary behavior during
the early-COVID-19 period
Table 2 shows descriptive statistics for the frequencies
of children who performed various types of PA on the
previous day during the early-COVID-19 period (April–
May 2020). The most frequently reported physical activ￾ities were free play/unstructured PA (e.g., running
around, tag, other active games) and going for a walk.
Child sex and age differences were observed in the fre￾quencies of reported physical activities (see Table 2).
Boys were more likely to participate in sports practice/
training than girls. Additionally, younger children (ages
5–8) were more likely to participate in free play/unstruc￾tured physical activity, biking, and scootering/skate￾boarding/roller skating than older children (ages 9–13).
However, older children were more likely to participate
in circuit training/conditioning than younger children.
Descriptive statistics for the duration (in minutes) of
various types of sedentary behaviors performed by chil￾dren on the previous day during the early-COVID-19
period (April–May 2020) are shown in Table 3. Children
spent the most time watching television/videos/ movies,
sitting while hanging out with friends and family in
person, doing school-related work, and playing com￾puter or video games. Child sex and age differences were
found in the duration of reported sedentary behaviors
(see Table 3). Boys spent more time than girls playing
computer or video games, whereas girls spent more time
than boys using the internet/emailing/electronic media
for leisure, doing video calls w/friends or family, sitting
while listening to music, sitting talking on the phone/
texting, sitting while hanging out with friends/family in
person, and doing inactive hobbies. As compared to
younger children, older children spent more time play￾ing computer or video games, using the Internet/email￾ing/ electronic media for leisure, sitting while listening
to music, and sitting talking on the phone/texting.

leisure during the early-COVID-19 period are shown in
Table 4. On average, children expended a total of 892.0
(SD = 902.07) MET-min on the previous day through the
specific types of physical activities assessed. Children en￾gaged in an average of 91.1 (SD = 109.2) min of sitting
for school-related activities, 398.5 (SD = 184.6) min of
sitting for leisure activity, and 489.4 (SD = 211.5) min of
total sitting on the previous day. After controlling for all
the variables in the model, child age was significantly
negatively associated with total MET-min of PA. Also,
child age was positively associated with minutes of
school-related sitting and total minutes of sitting. Lastly,
child age and being a girl were positively associated with
minutes of sitting for leisure during the early-COVID-19
period after controlling for the child ethnicity (Hispanic
vs. non-Hispanic), parent employment status (works
full-time vs. does not work full-time), parent marital sta￾tus (married vs. not married), and annual household
income.
Perceived changes in Children’s physical activity and
sedentary behavior
Overall, parents perceived children’s PA had decreased
whereas children’s SB had increased between the pre￾COVID-19 period (February 2020) and the early-COVID-19
period (April – May 2020). About 36% of parents reported

their child had done much less PA in the past 7 days as com￾pared to February 2020, whereas only about 11% of parents
reported their child had done much more PA in the past 7
days as compared to February 2020. In contrast, 41% of par￾ents reported their child had done much more sitting in the
past 7 days as compared to February 2020, whereas only
about 6% of parents reported their child had done much less
sitting in the past 7 days as compared to February 2020. Re￾sults of the ordinal logistic regression analyses predicting
perceived changes in PA and SB from the pre-COVID-19
period to the early-COVID-19 period by child sex and age
group controlling for child ethnicity (Hispanic vs. non￾Hispanic), annual household income, and parental marital
and work status are shown in Table 5. The predictor vari￾able, child age group, was found to contribute to the model
for perceived changes in PA (ordered log-odds estimate =
−.838, SE = .277, Wald = 9.120, p = .003) and the model for
perceived changes in SB (ordered log-odds estimate = .623,
SE = .280, Wald = 4.947, p = .026) controlling for all of the
other variables in the model. Parents of older children (ages
9–13) vs. younger children (ages 5–8) were over twice as
likely (OR = 2.31, 95% CI [1.34, 3.98]) to have a one-unit
change in the perception their children had done less PA in
past 7 days as compared to February 2020. The unadjusted
proportions of change in each PA category by child age
group are shown in Fig. 1. Parents of older children (ages 9–
13) vs. younger children (ages 5–8) were half as likely (OR =
0.54, 95% CI [0.31, 0.93]) to have a one-unit change in the
perception their children had done less SB in past 7 days as
compared to February 2020. The unadjusted proportions of
change in each sitting category by child age group are shown
in Fig. 2. The odds of perceiving changes in children’s PA
and SB were not associated with child sex.
Changes in locations of physical activity
Generalized estimating equations (GEE) tested changes in
the locations of children’s PA from the pre-COVID-19
period (February 2020) to the early-COVID-19 period (April
– May 2020). Results found the likelihood of performing PA
at home or in the garage (OR = 2.49, 95% CI[1.35, 4.60],
Wald = 8.593, p = .003) and on sidewalks and roads in their
neighborhood (OR = 1.92, 95% CI [1.04,4.60], Wald = 4.28,
p = .038) increased from the pre-COVID-19 period to the
early-COVID-19 period after controlling for child sex, child
age group, child ethnicity (Hispanic vs. non-Hispanic), parent
employment status (works full-time vs. does not work full￾time), parent marital status (married vs. not married), and
annual household income. In contrast, the likelihood of per￾forming PA at a park or trail (OR = 0.47, 95% CI [0.23, 0.97],
Wald = 4.22, p = .040) decreased from the pre-COVID￾period to the early-COVID-19 period. The likelihood of chil￾dren performing PA in their yard or driveway (OR = 1.32,
95% CI [0.76, 2.31], Wald = 0.95, p = .329) or on sidewalks
and roads outside the neighborhood (OR = 0.76, 95% CI
[0.25,2.33], Wald = .288, p = .633) did not change. Changes
in the locations of children’s PA did not differ by child sex or
age group (i.e., interactions between Time × Child sex and
Time × Child age group were not significant). GEE models

Discussion
This project is one of the first known studies to examine
the early effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on PA and SB
among U.S. children. Data were collected during a period
of time (April – May 2020) when the most restrictive pol￾icies were in place to prevent the spread of the virus, in￾cluding the closure of primary and secondary schools in all
50 states, the cancellation of team sports and activity classes
for youth, and the closure of public parks and playgrounds.
Generally, parents perceived children’s PA had decreased
whereas children’s SB had increased between the pre￾COVID-19 period and the early-COVID-19 period. The lo￾cations of children’s PA also changed drastically, with more
children performing PA at home or in the garage, and on
sidewalks and roads in their neighborhood during the
early-COVID-19 period. Overall, COVID-19 restrictions
seemed to have a larger impact on the PA and SB of older
children and girls. Of public health concern is these short￾term changes in behavior in reaction to COVID-19 may be￾come permanently entrenched, leading to increased risk of
obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease in children as
they get older. Therefore, programmatic and policy strat￾egies should be geared towards promoting PA and reducing
SB during the next few months of the pandemic.
Results found children had different patterns of activity
than what was seen before COVID-19. The most fre￾quently reported physical activities during the early￾COVID-19 period were free play/unstructured PA (e.g.,
running around, tag, other active games) and going for a
walk. This pattern was not surprising given school clo￾sures and team sports/activity class cancellations, most
children were spending their entire days at home with lit￾tle access to structured activities. However, it offers a con￾trast to typical patterns of children’s PA, suggesting that
unstructured and free play activities have become less
common as children’s time has been increasingly con￾sumed by organized activities [31]. Younger children (ages
5–8) were more likely to participate in free play/unstruc￾tured activities as, well as biking and scootering/skate￾boarding/roller skating than older children (ages 9–13),
most likely reflecting developmental preferences for these
types of activities [32]. Given the potential lack of access
to organized sports and activity classes over the next 6–
12 months due to concerns of COVID-19 spreading in
those settings, efforts to promote free and unstructured
PA among older children should be made perhaps by
playing with younger siblings or through socially-distant
or masked play dates with non-household peers.
Of the SB assessed, children spent the most time watch￾ing television/videos/movies, sitting while hanging out
with friends or family in person, doing school-related
work, and playing computer or video games during the
early-COVID-19 period. Interestingly, school-related sed￾entary time, including school-related video calls and doing
school-related work, only accounted for about 90 min on
the day assessed (which included weekdays and weekend
days). In contrast, sitting for leisure activities (e.g., video
games, TV, internet, hanging out with family) accounted
for over 8 h on the day that was assessed. It should be
noted that the item asking about “sitting while hanging
out with family or friends in person” would ideally be
assessed through two separate questions because it is rec￾ommended that individuals limit in-person contact with
people who live outside their household during the
COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, these data suggest during
the early-COVID-19 period, children overwhelmingly
spent their unstructured free time doing sedentary pur￾suits instead of physical activities. Girls and older children
generally spent more time in these sedentary behaviors
than boys and younger children, suggesting that sex and
age differences that are typically observed in sitting time
[33, 34] may be exacerbated during the COVID-19 pan￾demic, placing girls and older children at even greater risk
of health concerns due to physical inactivity such as obes￾ity and metabolic dysregulation.
Patterns observed in parents’ perceptions of changes
in children’s PA and SB between the pre- and early￾COVID-19 periods further underscore the heightened
risk of the pandemic for older children. While parents
generally perceived their children’s PA had decreased
and their SB had increased, these changes were much
more pronounced for older children (ages 9–13). Twice
as many parents of older (vs. younger) children reported
their child had done much less PA in the past 7 days as
compared to the pre-COVID-19 period. Although PA
typically declines and SB increases as children get older
[33, 35–38], the COVID-19 pandemic may be accelerat￾ing these development changes. Of great concern is
older children may adopt new behavioral habits of phys￾ical inactivity during the pandemic that are extremely
difficult to change when pandemic-related school clos￾ure and organized sports cancellations end. Although
objective monitor-based activity data are needed to lend
additional validity to these observed effects of the
Dunton et al. BMC Public Health (2020) 20:1351 Page 10 of 13

pandemic on older children’s activity levels, preventive ac￾tions may need to be taken before these types of data can
become available. If intermittent school closures and inter￾ruptions continue through the 2020–2021 academic year,
upper elementary and middle schools may make concerted
efforts to incorporate physical activities into distance￾learning curriculum such as activity breaks [39], physically
active subject-based lessons [40], or online physical educa￾tion. Gaps could also be addressed through the develop￾ment and delivery of free online physical activities and
lessons through non-profit and government entities.
Not surprisingly, the locations of children’s PA changed
drastically between the pre- and early-COVID-19 periods,
which may explain the perceived declines in children’s PA
reported by parents. The significant increase in the pro￾portion of children who performed PA at home or in the
garage most likely reflects common pre-COVID-19 loca￾tions for PA such as indoor and outdoor sports facilities,
and parks were not available. It was somewhat unex￾pected, however, to see that more of children’s PA ap￾peared to be displaced to inside the home or garage than
to the yard or driveway. Barriers to outdoor PA in one’s
yard or driveway such as inclement weather [41, 42] (espe￾cially in the Northern states in late April) or lack of out￾door space available at one’s place of residence [43] may
explain this pattern. The significant increase in children’s
PA occurring on the sidewalks and roads in their immedi￾ate neighborhood represents a unique trend observed dur￾ing the COVID-19 pandemic. More people staying at
home results in lower traffic volume on city streets [9]
and increased space for children’s PA. In some cases, cities
even placed signage on local streets to slow down traffic,
so pedestrians and bicyclists could use the street to allow
for social-distancing [44, 45]. Children’s increased usage
of local streets and sidewalks for PA parallels the substan￾tial percentage of parents who reported their child spent
time going for a walk on the previous day. Overall, these
trends point to a promising opportunity for city planners
and local governments who are searching for ways to pro￾mote PA during the COVID-19 pandemic.
One of the most unique findings to come out of this
study was the substantial percentage of children who
had begun using remote and streaming services to en￾gage in PA during the early-COVID-19 period. Prior to
the pandemic, using online technologies to deliver sports
training and activity classes had been growing among
adults [46], but had been slow to be adopted among
children [47]. In the current study, over 10 % of children
had participated in team sports training sessions or prac￾tice and almost a third of children had participated in
activity classes or lessons (e.g., martial arts, dance, yoga)
through remote or streaming services, representing a
significant departure from how children were typically
accessing organized PA prior to the pandemic. To stay
in business, many youth sport, martial arts, and dance
professionals shifted to online delivery during the early￾COVID-19 period [48]. In the future, children may be
receptive of these technologies as a replacement for in￾person forms of organized PA, which can be time- and
resource-consuming for families in terms of transporta￾tion and other costs. Whether the use of remote and
streaming services to promote children’s PA is an effect￾ive medium to teach skills, can be offered equitably
across diverse socioeconomic groups, and continue after
the pandemic needs to be better investigated.
Methodological strengths of the study included the
timeliness of the baseline survey during the early￾COVID-19 period and wide geographic representation.
Yet, some limitations existed. Asking parents to report
on children’s PA and SB was necessary for the youngest
children in the sample (e.g., ages 5–7) who may not yet
have the reading or cognitive capabilities to reliably re￾port for themselves. However, parents may be less aware
of the amount of time their middle-school children (e.g.,
ages 11–13) are spending on activities even when both
children and parents may be at home together due to
the pandemic. Along these same lines, asking parents to
compare their children’s early-COVID-19 (April–May
2020) PA and SB levels to their pre-COVID-19 (Febru￾ary 2020) levels may introduce some reporting error and
biases because most school-aged children were not in
their parents’ presence during school hours in February
2020. Also, some parents with essential jobs working out
of the home and parents who were working full-time at
home during the early-COVID-19 period may not have
an accurate representation of how much time their chil￾dren were spending in each type of activity. Further￾more, parents’ levels of physical activity were not
assessed, so it cannot be determined how children may
be role-modeling their parents. Lastly, the survey re￾spondents were mainly more highly educated mothers
with higher household income levels. Findings may not
extend to children whose parents have not attained a
college degree or who reside in lower income house￾holds. It will be useful for future research on the impact
of COVID-19 on children’s PA and SB to collect data
from a more racially-ethnically diverse sample and
among lower income families. Our sample was not rep￾resentative compared to U.S. demographic data. In 2018,
25% of U.S. children identified as Hispanic while 50%
identified as non-Hispanic White [49] whereas our sam￾ple 13% Hispanic and 77% non-Hispanic White. The
sample was not geographically equally distributed almost
a third of participants resided in California. Compared
to U.S. data [50], our sample had fewer adults employed
full-time (61%); however, employment changes due to
COVID-19 have not been accounted for in U.S. demo￾graphic data reports.

Conclusions
Overall, results from this study suggest U.S. children
performed less PA and engaged in more SB during the
early-COVID-19 period as compared to before the pan￾demic. Although school and park closures and cancella￾tions of team sports and organized activity classes were
necessary steps to mitigate the spread of the virus and
allow healthcare facilities to build capacity, they appear
to have had a profound impact on children’s PA and SB
levels—especially among older children (ages 9–13). In
order to avoid permanent changes in behavior extending
beyond the duration of the COVID-19 closures, mea￾sures must be taken over the summer and fall of 2020 to
promote home- and neighborhood-based PA during
children’s leisure time.
