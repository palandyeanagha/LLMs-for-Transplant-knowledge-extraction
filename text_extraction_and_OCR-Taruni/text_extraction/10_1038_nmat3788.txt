Translating materials design 
to the clinic
Jeffrey A. Hubbell and Robert Langer
Many materials-based therapeutic systems have reached the clinic or are in clinical trials. Here we 
describe materials design principles and the construction of delivery vehicles, as well as their adaptation 
and evaluation for human use.
Materials-based therapeutics are 
having substantial impact on 
clinical medicine, for example 
in cancer therapy, vaccine development, 
and tissue repair and regeneration, fuelled 
by the rich innovation in fundamental 
science and the development of a host 
of technological approaches. In this 
Commentary, we highlight exciting 
advances in materials science, mostly 
applied to drug delivery, which are 
approaching the reality of clinical 
translation. We discuss examples from 
the early stages of the drug-discovery 
pipeline to those well on the road to clinical 
approval. We describe materials design 
from concept to demonstration in rodent 
models of disease, to the adaptation and 
evaluation for therapeutic use in patients.
For illustrative purposes and in the 
interest of brevity, we discuss selected 
examples only. Broader coverage in the 
areas of nanomaterials1–3 and cancer 
therapeutics4,5 can be found elsewhere.
Tumour vascular targeting
The motivation for pursuing nanomaterials 
in cancer therapeutics has long been 
the higher permeability to colloids of 
tumour vasculature relative to healthy 
vasculature — the so-called enhanced 
permeability and retention (EPR) effect1
. 
Whereas small molecules may permeate 
equally well within healthy and tumour￾associated vasculature, nanoscale materials 
permeate much more readily through the 
tumour vasculature, providing a means 
for tumour-specific targeting based on 
the physiology of the tumour6,7. Below we 
highlight selected examples of materials in 
the sub-100-nm size range that can exploit 
the EPR effect for tumour targeting.
One anticancer delivery vehicle that 
may be clinically successful incorporates 
paclitaxel (a hydrophobic drug) within the 
hydrophobic cores of micelles formed from 
amphiphilic block copolymers comprising 
poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and chemically 
modified poly(aspartic acid)8
. The size 
of the micelles and the critical micelle 
concentration can be controlled by 
manipulating the degree of polymerization 
of the modified poly(aspartic acid), and a 
spherical morphology can be obtained by 
selecting PEG of an appropriate degree of 
polymerization. The hydrophobicity of the 
drug cargo drives it into the hydrophobic 
micellar core, and thus ensures drug 
solubilization. Release from the nanoscale 
system is provided by slow dissolution 
into the aqueous biological fluids. The 
translation of this paclitaxel-incorporating 
polymeric delivery system, namely NK105, 
into the clinic is being led by NanoCarrier. 
The micellar nanomaterials are about 
85 nm in diameter9
, and have shown 
increased bioavailability (as measured 
by plasma area under the curve (AUC) 
values or as a measure of time-integrated 
drug exposure) of >50-fold in rodents8
and >15-fold in phase I clinical studies9
compared with the free drug. NK105 has 
also demonstrated markedly reduced 
nephrotoxicity in animal models. A 
limited number of phase II studies have 
been published10, and the path of NK105 
towards clinical reality remains to be 
seen. In the design of NK105, micelles 
in the sub-100-nm size range were 
produced to allow extravasation in the 
hyperpermeable tumour vasculature, and 
hydrophobic domains were introduced 
into the nanomaterials to solubilize 
hydrophobic drugs.
Investigation of the EPR effect using 
animal models has revealed that the 
vasculature of some tumours allowed 
extravasation of micelles around 100 nm, 
but that the vasculature of other tumour 
types was less hyperpermeable. Such 
variability is also thought to exist in human 
tumours of different types7
. When smaller 
micelles were tested, those with a 30-nm 
diameter were observed to penetrate 
the vasculature of all tested tumours in 
the animal models11, thus revealing that 
very small nanoparticles are more useful 
than larger ones. Clinical results from 
a second anticancer micellar delivery 
system currently under development 
by NanoCarrier are consistent with 
this observation. This delivery system, 
NC-6004, is formed from a block 
copolymer of PEG and poly(glutamic acid). 
Complexation of cisplatin to the carboxyl 
side-chains of the copolymer generates 
30-nm-diameter micelles, which are in the 
advantageous size regime12. When these 
cisplatin-loaded micelles were evaluated in 
a rodent model, the drug displayed lower 
neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity than the 
free drug, as well as a 65-fold enhancement 
in AUC13. In a phase I clinical investigation, 
more than an 8-fold enhancement in AUC 
was observed14, indicating a reduction 
in off-target toxicity. Thus, in its design, 
NC-6004 has the ability to harness the EPR 
effect as well as use chemical complexation 
to provide drug loading.
More refined micellar designs are also 
being pursued. For example, polymer 
micelles with complexed drugs have 
been designed to release their payload 
only in acidic endosomal compartments, 
which are physically located near the cell’s 
nucleus15. Specifically, the complexation 
of an oxaliplatin compound to a PEG–
We hope that research will 
further connect observations 
in animal models to the 
elucidation of efficacy 
and safety in human 
clinical applications.

COMMENTARY | INSIGHT
poly(glutamic acid)-based block copolymer 
has been shown to deliver the drug to the 
nucleus in a sufficiently targeted manner to 
avoid detoxification mechanisms that are 
present in the cytoplasm and can lead to 
drug resistance. Given that the chemistry of 
these micelles is similar to that of NC-6004 
this design should also be translatable to 
the clinic.
The ability to design polymeric 
nanoparticles that can also achieve cellular 
targeting may be an even more effective 
strategy. Nanoparticles composed of 
Food and Drug Administration-approved 
materials (such as copolymers of lactic 
and glycolic acid) that have an outer PEG 
shell circulate for a long time in animals16, 
and can be directed towards tumours by 
adding a peptide to the nanoparticles’ 
outer surface that targets receptors that 
are overexpressed in tumour vasculature. 
Initial studies by BIND Therapeutics 
have shown these hybrid materials to 
have an acceptable safety profile and to 
be a potentially effective approach for 
targeting solid tumours in humans17. 
The polymeric nanoparticle formulation 
BIND-014, which is in phase II clinical 
trials, entraps the chemotherapeutic drug 
docetaxel within a 100-nm-diameter 
nanoparticle composed of PEG and 
polylactic acid. The nanoparticles are 
functionalized with a small-molecule 
targeting ligand for the prostate-specific 
membrane antigen (PSMA), which is 
present on prostate-cancer cells and on 
the neovasculature of other non-prostate 
solid tumours. Studies in animal models 
demonstrate that the nanoparticles find 
their target by means of both the EPR 
effect and biomolecular targeting of 
the ligand to PSMA. Published interim 
results from a phase I study demonstrate 
that the pharmacokinetics in humans is 
significantly improved by entrapment of the 
drug within the nanoparticle. The plasma 
levels of docetaxel were at least 100-fold 
higher than the equivalent dose of the free, 
soluble drug (Fig. 1a), which is consistent 
with observations in animal models17. 
Furthermore, the pharmacokinetics can be 
predicted from the injected dose (Fig. 1b). 
These results present early evidence of 
efficacy, with disappearance or shrinkage of 
multiple lung metastases in a patient with 
metastatic cholangiocarcinoma (Fig. 1c), 
and shrinkage of tonsillar lesions in a 
patient with tonsillar cancer17.
In addition to the tumour cells 
themselves being a target, delivery to 
other cells in the tumour may be equally 
powerful. Recent studies in mouse models 
report a nanoscale delivery system that 
homes to the tumour vasculature by 
targeting coagulum present in the vessels18, 
reducing blood flow and thus nutrition 
to the tumour. Additionally, a recent 
study with docetaxel covalently linked to 
120-nm-diameter nanoparticles showed a 
substantial effect on tumour stromal cells19, 
which provide supporting and immune 
regulatory function in the tumour and 
modulate tumour vascular permeability. 
It may be that these nanoparticles have 
some unknown special feature that targets 
stroma, or that the many nanoparticle 
formulations that penetrate into the 
tumour deliver drug more efficiently to 
the stroma compared with injection of the 
free drug.
Delivery of small interfering RNA
The anticancer therapies we have discussed 
all involve hydrophobic drugs for 
which solubility is a problem, however, 
their permeation of hydrophobic cell 
membranes is straightforward. Therapeutic 
molecules that are hydrophilic, such 
as small interfering RNA (siRNA)20,21, 
however, behave in the opposite manner. 
Indeed, siRNA is highly soluble, but 
its hydrophilicity restricts membrane 
permeation and access to the cytoplasm, 
where the drug is active. These hurdles 
can, nevertheless, be overcome through 
materials design. For example, because 
siRNA is negatively charged, researchers 
have developed nanoparticle-forming 
cationic polymers to deliver siRNA to the 
cytoplasm22. More specifically, a water￾soluble polymer made of an oligomer of 
cyclodextrin (a sugar-based macrocycle 
with a hydrophobic ‘host’ core) can be 
chemically modified to become cationic 
on its exterior, allowing electrostatic 
complexation with siRNA to form sub￾100-nm nanoparticles (Fig. 2). From other 
studies, however, it has been shown that 
cationic amino-functionalized polymers 
can cause disruption of endosomes after 
cellular uptake because of the proton￾sponge effect23 — that is, as protons are 
pumped into the endosome during the 
normal process of endosomal acidification, 
the amine functions neutralize the charge, 
which leads to an osmotic imbalance and 
rupture of the endosome. As a consequence 
of their positive charge, the cyclodextrin￾based nanoparticles can undergo 
nonspecific clearance; however, this can 
be blocked by attaching hydrophobic 
tags to the termini of hydrophilic and

targeting the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA). Studies in animal models demonstrate that 
the nanoparticles find their target by means of the EPR effect and the ligand-mediated biomolecular 
interactions. a, Phase I studies demonstrate that the pharmacokinetics of the drug in humans is improved 
by entrapping it within nanoparticles, with slower clearance from blood plasma and at least a 100-
fold elevated increase in plasma levels compared with the free form of the drug (Taxotere, a clinical

nonionic PEG chains, forming host–guest 
interactions with the cyclodextrin core 
(Fig. 2). Furthermore, because the 
transferrin receptor is upregulated in 
many tumours, transferrin can be attached 
to the PEG host to target tumour cells 
by molecular recognition24. In a mouse 
model, transferrin targeting led to a 
doubling of tumour-specific knockdown 
of gene expression24 compared with that 
achieved with the EPR effect alone. Thus, 
this macrocyclic siRNA delivery system 
is an example of a combination of design 
principles: electrostatic complexation for 
drug loading, the induction of an osmotic 
imbalance for promoting drug permeation 
into the cytoplasm, and the molecular 
targeting of biomolecular features specific 
to tumour cells that lie beneath the 
hyperpermeable vasculature.
This cyclodextrin-based targeted siRNA 
delivery system is in clinical development 
at Arrowhead Research Corporation. 
The product, CALAA-01, uses an siRNA 
sequence to block expression of the M2 
subunit of ribonucleotide reductase. 
CALAA-01 has been characterized 
in animal models25 and in human 
clinical studies, and has shown tumour￾specific knockdown in patients with 
metastatic melanoma26.
Another approach for siRNA delivery 
involves its encapsulation in liposomes — 
a strategy that is particularly attractive for 
targeting the liver because of the organ’s role 
in particle clearance. Although liposomes 
have been used for some 50 years, the 
number of lipids that have been used 
for creating them has been very limited. 
Recently, a high-throughput synthesis 
approach has made it possible to generate 
and screen thousands of new lipids27–29, 
enabling the creation of liposome-like 
structures that have progressively lowered 
the amount of siRNA that is required to 
achieve knockdown of genes by three or 
four orders of magnitude. Molecularly 
self-assembled nucleic acid nanoparticles 
with precisely controlled origami structures 
have also been synthesized for targeted 
siRNA delivery30.
Responsive nanomaterials
Phase transitions in nanomaterials 
are being used to address the issue of 
poor penetration of hydrophilic drugs 
through cellular membranes. After 
endocytosis from the extracellular milieu, 
the endosome is slowly acidified from 
pH 7.4 to approximately pH 6.5 in the 
early endosome, to pH 6.0 in the late 
endosome and eventually to approximately 
pH 5.5 after fusion with the lysosome31. 
In the context of sensitive biomolecular 
drugs, the earlier a drug can be induced 
to escape this path (which also involves 
exposure to enzymes and a harsh redox 
environment), the less degradation it 
should experience. Families of polymers 
have thus been designed with very sharp 
transitions in hydrophobicity as a function 
of pH32,33. These polymers do not affect the 
plasma membrane at the exterior surface 
of the cell (pH 7.4), but after endocytosis 
and acidification to pH 6.5 they disrupt 
the endosome, which leads to efficient 
cytoplasmic delivery of an otherwise 
membrane-impermeable payload. A few 
such polymers, under development by 
PhaseRx, have been shown to be useful 
for the delivery of sensitive hydrophilic 
macromolecules, including siRNA34 and 
plasmid DNA35. These materials exemplify 
a design principle for transporting 
hydrophilic drugs across biological 
membranes: engineering phase transitions 
to hydrophobic, membrane-destabilizing 
structures, but only at pH values 
encountered after cellular uptake.
The drug-carrying self-assembling 
micelles discussed so far are made from 
synthetic polymers. However, researchers 
have demonstrated that recombinant 
proteins can also be used. Some proteins 
have evolved a thermoresponsive 
self-assembling character, with elastin 
being a well-studied example. Elastin 
comprises a pentapeptide repeat, VPGVG, 
which self-assembles to form a gel-like 
state36. The sequence can be generalized 
to VPGXG, where X can be any amino 
acid except proline. The biophysical 
properties of the amino acid X in such 
elastin-like peptides (ELPs)36 affect the 
properties of the resulting gel, including 
its sol–gel transition temperature. In one 
implementation, a recombinant protein 
block-copolymer with a soluble ELP fused 
to a polypeptide domain rich in cysteine 
was designed so that the cysteine could be 
used to conjugate the chemotherapeutic, 
doxorubicin, the hydrophobicity of which 
drove the formation of sub-100-nm 
micelles37. The doxorubicin-loaded micelles 
targeted the tumour vasculature by means 
of the EPR effect, and led to enhanced 
tumour killing and reduced systemic 
toxicity of the drug in tumour models37. 
In a more sophisticated implementation, 
the thermal sensitivity of ELP-based 
protein–drug conjugates was exploited for 
combined chemotherapy and hyperthermia 
therapy. In this case, heat applied to 
the tumour was used to destabilize the 
polymer micelles, leading to the increase 
of small-molecule drug deposition in 
the tumour38. By carefully adjusting the 
amino acid sequence of the ELP as well as 
its molecular weight and degree of drug 
grafting, thermal transitions between 
37 °C and 42 °C could be achieved, which 
permitted hyperthermic tumour-specific 
targeting at modest temperature changes. 
In these ELP-based drugs, we identify 
the design principles of self-assembly by 
biomimicry and of triggering drug release 
by external manipulation, and, more 
specifically, of using localized heating to 
drive the nanomaterial through a thermal 
phase transition.
The translation of the design principle 
of ELP self-assembly to the clinic can 
also be achieved by using recombinant 
protein drugs. Given that the proteins are 
produced by a recombinant methodology, 
recombinant fusions of therapeutic proteins 
with ELP domains could yield protein

Figure 2 | In a phase I study in cancer patients 
an siRNA formulation CALAA-01 demonstrated 
efficient knockdown of gene expression in 
human tumours. The siRNA nanoparticle is 
based on a polymer of cationically derivatized 
cyclodextrin complexed with the anionic siRNA 
payload. The nanoparticles are stabilized by 
binding of hydrophobically terminated PEG to the 
cyclodextrin rings, which occurs via the interaction 
of the hydrophobe (guest) within the core of the 
cyclodextrin (host). Delivery of cyclodextrin￾bound-PEG further grafted with transferrin — a 
protein for which many tumour cells over-express 
a receptor — resulted in knockdown of target 
messenger RNA and the reduction of protein levels 
in tumours, opening the door for further clinical 
investigations focused on antitumour activity24,26.

variants that self-assemble at the site of 
injection to form a depot39. Moreover, 
because such an ELP assembly occurs in a 
dynamic manner and ELPs can dissociate 
into soluble unimers comprising the ELP 
domain fused to the bioactive protein 
domain, the therapeutic proteins in the 
depot should slowly escape into systemic 
circulation. PhaseBio Pharmaceuticals is 
developing an ELP-fused GLP-1 receptor 
agonist for type 2 diabetes. This design 
of a single recombinant fusion protein 
made of the drug and the self-assembling 
polymer allows the conjugate to be 
produced in a more precise and efficient 
manner than could otherwise be attained 
through chemical grafting of the protein 
to the polymer. In this example, the drug￾delivery system combines the concepts of 
drug retention and drug release into its 
very structure.
Nanomaterials for phototherapy
Drug-delivery particles function as carriers 
of the active agent, yet in some cases the 
particle itself can be the active agent. For 
example, plasmonic gold nanoshells in the 
sub-50-nm regime are known to efficiently 
absorb near-infrared light and subsequently 
produce heat40–42. Hyperthermia at the site 
of vascular permeability has been shown to 
lead to selective and efficient photothermal 
killing of tumours (when irradiated with a 
near-infrared laser, either directly or from 
a fibre optic probe) in animal models as a 
consequence of the accumulation of the 
nanoshell at tumour sites because of the 
EPR effect43. These materials, referred to 
as AuroShell particles, are being tested 
in the clinic by NanoSpectra Biosciences. 
Interestingly, because there is no bioactive 
molecule involved in the therapy, AuroShell 
particles are regulated as a medical device 
rather than a drug. As well as taking 
advantage of the EPR effect, tumour 
targeting can also be achieved by means 
of nanoparticle-associated antibodies that 
bind to HER2 on tumour cells44,45 or to 
VEGF-R2 on sites of active angiogenesis 
in tumours46.
Outlook
We have illustrated several materials and 
some physiological and biophysical design 
principles — the EPR effect, self-assembly, 
controlled dissociation, phase transitions 
and disruption of biological barriers — and 
discussed how they can be leveraged and 
interconnected to achieve drug-delivery 
efficacy in disease models. Moreover, we 
have highlighted a few therapeutic areas 
where materials may play an important role 
in the future of medicine, but numerous 
challenges remain.
We hope that research will further 
connect observations in animal models 
to the elucidation of efficacy and safety 
in human clinical applications. More 
specifically, future approaches may 
enable drugs to be delivered by sending 
radiofrequency waves activated by remote 
control to microchips implanted in the 
human body47. New tissues and organs 
that are created using a combination of 
materials and cells may revolutionize 
transplantation, perhaps enabling the 
production of drugs in situ using cells
or the generation of functional organs. 
Examples include nanowires being put 
into engineered heart tissue to provide 
enhanced performance48 and nanowired 
sensors being placed into a variety of 
tissues to monitor and improve tissue 
function49. Creating new materials that 
resist bacterial adhesion50 and prevent 
thrombus formation when in contact 
with blood51 is also extremely important. 
Nanomaterials are also impacting the 
field of vaccines, for example, by using 
interstitial flow to direct very small 
nanoparticles to dendritic cells resident 
in the lymph nodes52–55. The next years 
of clinical development will certainly be 
exciting for materials-based drug-delivery 
therapeutics as well as for materials-based 
tissue engineering and medical devices. ❐
