Acute kidney injury (AKI) is estimated to occur in 
about 20–200 per million population in the community, 
7–18% of patients in hospital, and approximately 50% 
of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU)1,2
. 
Importantly, AKI is associated with morbidity and mor￾tality; an estimated 2 million people worldwide die of 
AKI every year, whereas AKI survivors are at increased 
risk of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD) and 
end-stage renal disease (ESRD) — conditions that carry 
a high economic, societal and personal burden3,4
.
Over the past 15 years, consensus definitions have 
been reached for both AKI and CKD; these definitions 
are applied routinely for the diagnosis of these diseases in
research and clinical practice5,6
. The Kidney Disease: 
Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines define 
AKI as an abrupt decrease in kidney function that occurs 
over a period of 7 days or less, and CKD as abnormalities 
in kidney structure or function that persist for >90 days6
. 
However, it is increasingly recognized that AKI and CKD 
are not always discrete entities and likely represent a 
continuum with patients who have sustained an episode 
of AKI having an increased risk of developing either 
de novo CKD or worsening of underlying CKD4 (FIGS 1,2). 
In addition, the risk factors for AKI and CKD, such
as advanced age, diabetes and hypertension, often over￾lap. The term acute kidney disease (AKD)5
 has been pro￾posed to define the course of disease after AKI among 
patients in whom the renal pathophysiologic processes are 
ongoing. Although AKI and CKD are well-characterized 
entities, AKD has not been systematically studied. As a 
prerequisite to the further study of AKD, the research 
community requires a common lexicon to standardize 
approaches and enable comparisons of different studies. 
Developing a common lexicon requires the formulation of

Abstract | Consensus definitions have been reached for both acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic 
kidney disease (CKD) and these definitions are now routinely used in research and clinical practice. 
The KDIGO guideline defines AKI as an abrupt decrease in kidney function occurring over 7 days 
or less, whereas CKD is defined by the persistence of kidney disease for a period of >90 days. AKI 
and CKD are increasingly recognized as related entities and in some instances probably represent 
a continuum of the disease process. For patients in whom pathophysiologic processes are ongoing, 
the term acute kidney disease (AKD) has been proposed to define the course of disease after AKI; 
however, definitions of AKD and strategies for the management of patients with AKD are not 
currently available. In this consensus statement, the Acute Disease Quality Initiative (ADQI) 
proposes definitions, staging criteria for AKD, and strategies for the management of affected 
patients. We also make recommendations for areas of future research, which aim to improve 
understanding of the underlying processes and improve outcomes for patients with AKD.

the link between AKI and CKD is firmly established, the 
AKD period represents the time window wherein critical 
interventions might be initiated to alter the natural his￾tory of kidney disease. To develop a common framework 
and support further research for acute and progressive 
kidney disease, the 16th Acute Disease Quality Initiative 
(ADQI) sought to propose definitions and staging criteria 
for AKD and renal recovery and make recommendations for 
clinical practice and future research. 
Methods
The Conference Chairs of the 16th ADQI consensus 
committee (L.S.C., J.A.K. and C.R.) convened a diverse 
panel of clinicians and researchers representing relevant 
disciplines — internal medicine, primary care, nephrol￾ogy, critical care, paediatrics, pharmacy, epidemiology, 
health-services research, biostatistics, bioinformatics 
and data analytics — from Europe, North America and 
Australia, to discuss the issues relating to persistent AKI 
and renal recovery. The conference was held over 2.5 days 
in San Diego, USA on November 8–10, 2015.
This consensus meeting followed the established 
ADQI process, and used a modified Delphi method to 
achieve consensus, as previously described7,8
. The broad 
objective of ADQI 16 was to produce expert-based state￾ments and a summary of current knowledge pertaining 
to the definition and management of AKD for use by 
clinicians and researchers according to ADQI’s profes￾sional judgment and to identify evidence gaps to estab￾lish research priorities. Conference participants were 
divided into four work groups, which were tasked with 
formulating strategies for the initial workup and man￾agement of AKD and renal recovery in four different 
areas: Group 1 was tasked with developing recommen￾dations for defining persistent AKI and AKD. Group 2 
was tasked with developing definitions and staging for 
AKD. Group 3 developed recommendations for the 
management of patients with AKI and/or AKD requiring 
renal replacement therapy (RRT). Group 4 was tasked 
with developing recommendations for the management 
of medications among patients with AKD. Members of
the work groups performed reviews of the literature 
in a systematic manner and developed a consensus of 
opinion, backed by evidence where possible, to distil the 
available literature and articulate a research agenda to 
address important unanswered questions. In addition, 
the members were asked to note the level of evidence for
all consensus statements using the Oxford Centre 
for Evidence-based Medicine Levels of Evidence9
. All 
of the individual workgroups iteratively presented their 
output to conference participants and the final product 
was then assessed and aggregated in a session attended 
by all attendees, who formally voted and approved the 
consensus recommendations. Discussion of the use of 
peritoneal dialysis as an option for treating AKI was

excluded as this approach is typically used in austere 
conditions and special circumstances (for example,
in small children).
Persistent AKI
Transient versus persistent AKI
Various studies, generally limited by the patient popu￾lations selected and the use of serum creatinine 
changes to assess renal function, have applied different 
thresholds for the duration of AKI episodes and func￾tional renal recovery to discriminate transient from 
persistent AKI (see Supplementary information S1
(table)). Regardless of disease severity, these studies 
demonstrate that complete and sustained reversal of 
an AKI episode within 48–72h of its onset is associated 
with better outcomes than longer durations of AKI10–15.
Based on the available data and expert opinion, the 
workgroup proposes using 48h to define rapid reversal 
of AKI (BOX 1). The rationale for selecting 48 h rather 
than 72 h to define rapid reversal is to better identify 
high-risk patients for whom additional workup and 
evaluation might be warranted. Although previous stud￾ies have relied primarily on serum creatinine to identify 
AKI, the workgroup recommends also using urine out￾put criteria as recommended by KDIGO5
. The impor￾tance of urine output criteria in defining persistent 
AKI was confirmed in a 2015 study of 32,045 critically 
ill patients, which demonstrated that short-term and 
long-term risk of death or RRT is greatest for patients 
who meet both the serum creatinine and urine output 
criteria for AKI and experience these abnormalities
for longer than 3 days12.
For AKI that has reversed, it is unknown when sus￾tained reversal can be considered to have occurred. 
Although the duration of sustained reversal might 
be different for rapidly reversing and persistent AKI 
we propose a minimum of 48 h as being necessary to 
separate two distinct episodes of AKI. After sustained 
reversal has occurred, a second episode of AKI should 
be considered independently of the first, with new inves￾tigations to exclude potentially new reversible causes or 
Figure 2 | The continuum of acute kidney injury (AKI), 
acute kidney disease (AKD) and chronic kidney disease
(CKD). AKI, AKD and CKD can form a continuum whereby 
initial kidney injury can lead to persistent renal injury, 
eventually leading to CKD. AKI is defined as an abrupt 
decrease in kidney function occurring over 7 days or less, 
whereas CKD is defined by the persistence of kidney disease 
for a period of >90 days. AKD describes acute or subacute 
damage and/or loss of kidney function for a duration of 
between 7 and 90 days after exposure to an AKI initiating 
event. Recovery from AKI within 48h of the initiating event 
typically heralds rapid reversal of AKI. For patients with 
pre-existing CKD, the AKI event can be superimposed on 
CKD, with AKD existing on a background of CKD. Patients 
who suffer AKD with pre-existing CKD are probably at 
high-risk of kidney disease progression. Modified from 
Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative 16; www.adqi.org.
Box 1 | Definitions of AKI and AKD, initial management of AKI, and assessment of kidney function
Consensus statement 1A:
Persistent acute kidney injury (AKI) is characterized by the continuance of AKI by serum creatinine or urine output criteria 
(as defined by KDIGO) beyond 48h from AKI onset. Complete reversal of AKI by KDIGO criteria within 48h of AKI onset 
characterizes rapid reversal of AKI (evidence grade: level 5).
Consensus statement 1B:
Although the optimal duration of sustained AKI reversal is unknown, a minimum of 48h is necessary to separate two 
distinct AKI episodes (evidence grade: level 5).
Consensus statement 1C:
AKI and acute kidney disease (AKD) are a continuum, and persistent AKI frequently becomes AKD, defined as a condition 
wherein criteria for AKI stage 1 or greater persists ≥7 days after an exposure (FIG. 2; TABLE 1; evidence grade: level 4).
Consensus statement 1D:
Initial management of persistent AKI should include reassessment of the underlying aetiology of AKI and precise 
measurement of kidney function. When persistent AKI is diagnosed, additional monitoring should be considered to 
re‑evaluate haemodynamic and volume status, adequacy of kidney perfusion, and to identify complications of AKI, such 
as fluid overload, acidosis and hyperkalaemia, as these could indicate a need for renal replacement therapy. Nephrology 
consultation should be considered if the aetiology of AKI is not clear or subspecialist care is needed (evidence grade: 
level 5).
Consensus statement 1E:
An urgent need exists for clinical tools to enable the precise measurement of kidney function in the setting of AKI as 
existing tools are impractical for routine clinical use. At present, timed urine creatinine clearance is the best available 
estimate of kidney function for patients with persistent AKI in the steady state (evidence grade: level 4).
Consensus statement 1F:
Equations to estimate glomerular filtration rate in the setting of chronic kidney disease are not accurate for the 
assessment of renal function in persistent AKI (evidence grade: level 4).

contributing factors. This time period of 48h to sepa￾rate distinct AKI episodes is arbitrary and will require 
further study and validation.
Identification of persistent AKI
Early identification of persistent AKI is important in 
order to initiate an extended evaluation and management 
protocol to avoid further kidney damage and associated 
mortality16. An array of tools including clinical scoring 
systems, imaging approaches, and biomarkers must be 
developed to identify patients at risk of persistent AKI. 
A 2016 study of nearly 17,000 patients demonstrated 
that persistence of AKI and a stuttering versus prompt 
recovery pattern are linked to morbidity and mortality17. 
Importantly, these data suggest that interventions that 
alter the recovery pattern of AKI have the potential to 
improve patient outcomes. As most patients with severe 
sepsis — an important cause of AKI — present to the 
hospital with ongoing AKI, approaches to mitigate 
injury and enhance recovery from AKI should be areas 
of immediate focus18. However, clinical risk scores for 
persistent AKI have not been validated for general use 
and the risk factors that contribute to persistent AKI, 
AKD, and delayed recovery among hospitalized patients 
are not known. Several studies have identified clinical 
risk scores, biomarkers, imaging, and functional tests 
to differentiate rapid reversal of AKI from persisting 
AKI19–27 (see Supplementary information S2 (table)). In 
the opinion of the ADQI workgroup, these tools would 
likely work well together and are a recommended area 
of future research (BOX 2).
Management of persistent AKI
Persistent AKI occurs in a subset of patients with 
AKI17; given the poor outcomes associated with per￾sistent AKI, the ADQI workgroup recommends the 
presence of persistent AKI as a wake‑up call to initiate 
further assessment and evaluation of treatment options. 
When a diagnosis of persistent AKI is made, the cli￾nician should reassess the patient carefully and recon￾sider treatment options. First, the aetiology of the AKI 
should be considered. In most cases this aetiology is 
multifactorial, and it will occur secondary to another 
disease (for example, sepsis or shock) and notably can 
occur in early, middle, or late phases of the patient’s 
hospital stay2,28. A diagnosis of persistent AKI should 
prompt re‑evaluation of the possible causes of AKI, 
and correction of the underlying cause(s) when pos￾sible. Identification of potential causes of AKI might 
require additional tests such as evaluation of urine 
sediment, proteinuria, biomarker assessment and/or 
imaging. In select circumstances, consultation of other 
specialties might be needed to help diagnose rare causes 
of AKI (for example, caused by tumour lysis syndrome, 
thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and cholesterol 
embolization syndrome).
Approaches to assess renal function. Current approaches 
to measure glomerular filtration rate (GFR) with inulin, 
51Cr-EDTA, or iohexol are time-consuming and laborious, 
and are therefore unsuitable for use in patients in intensive 
care. Equations for estimated GFR (eGFR), such as the 
modification of diet in renal disease (MDRD) or chronic 
kidney disease epidemiology collaboration (CKD–EPI) 
equations, were validated in patients with CKD. These 
equations can be used in the outpatient setting but not in 
the ICU setting, because they require serum creatinine to 
be in ‘steady-state’ (REF. 29). As an alternative, short timed 
urine creatinine clearance (CCr) can be used to estimate 
GFR. However, several limitations exist to the use of CCr 
in ICU patients. For instance, CCr will often overestimate 
GFR, especially in patients with AKI, as creatinine is also 
excreted in the tubules, and establishing steady state 
conditions is often not possible30–32.
Some additional approaches to estimate GFR deserve 
further exploration. The Jelliffe equation for unstable 
kidney function, which is calculated on the basis of the 
volume of distribution and creatinine kinetics rather 
than steady state parameters such as body weight or age, 
correlated well with CCr in a small study of 12 patients 
in the ICU33,34. The kinetic eGFR, which similarly to the 
Jelliffe equation, estimates GFR on the basis of the cre￾atinine kinetics has shown promise in renal transplant 
recipients, but should be validated in other cohorts such 
as hospitalized patients with native kidneys35. Iohexol 
clearance has been used in critically ill patients but as 
mentioned above, is laborious and time consuming36,37. 
Finally, fibreoptic ratiometric fluorescence analysis has 
shown promise for the measurement of GFR in large ani￾mals but awaits validation in human clinical settings38. 
Box 2 | Research recommendations to aid the assessment of persistent AKI and AKD
Consensus statement 1H:
An array of tools (such as clinical risk scores, imaging techniques, functional testing, and biomarkers) are needed to 
identify patients who are likely to have persistent acute kidney injury (AKI; evidence grade: level 5).
Consensus statement 1I:
Alternative approaches for estimating glomerular filtration rate (GFR), such as kinetic GFR and the Jeliffe equation need 
to be further evaluated in different patient populations (research recommendation).
Consensus statement 1J:
Additional studies are needed to elucidate the relationship between biomarkers of glomerular and tubular damage and 
outcomes of persistent AKI and acute kidney disease (AKD; research recommendation).
Consensus statement 1K:
The existing and emerging approaches for risk stratification of persistent AKI need to be further evaluated (research 
recommendation).

Given that patients who have persistent AKI have worse 
outcomes than those of patients who recover from AKI, 
the ability to predict the clinical course of AKI with use 
of biomarkers of tubular or glomerular injury might 
help to differentiate these patients from those who will 
recover and enable prediction of outcomes. We therefore 
recommend that further research relating to biomarkers 
and renal functional tests should focus on this cohort of 
patients with AKI (BOX 2).
From a treatment standpoint, patients with persistent 
AKI should be re‑assessed on a daily basis bearing in 
mind at least two key considerations. First, the ongoing 
volume needs of the patient and risk of volume overload, 
and second, an assessment of the necessity of nephro￾toxic medications and their appropriate dosing, balanc￾ing the risk of AKI and the benefits of each individual 
drug for the patient. Optimization of haemodynamic 
and volume status are important for the resolution of 
AKI, and these parameters should be evaluated closely39.
Baseline creatinine assessment
The best method for assessing baseline creatinine level 
can be uncertain given the inherent biologic variation 
in serum creatinine and the fact that serum creatinine 
measurements are made only when clinically indicated40. 
Although no approach to the assessment of baseline 
creatinine is perfect, the goal should be to reduce bias 
in anchoring the definition of AKD and its recovery. 
Towards that end, the use of known creatinine values is 
superior to imputation41. For patients in whom one or 
more pre-morbid serum creatinine values are available 
but show significant fluctuation, the choice of the serum 
creatinine measurement that best reflects the most 
appropriate baseline value may require adjudication by 
an expert clinician. In a large dataset, the mean serum 
creatinine value assessed 7–365 days before admission 
closely approximated expert clinical adjudication of 
baseline creatinine level41. Differences in misclassifica￾tion were, however, modest compared with other avail￾able creatinine values, including the measurement taken 
at the time closest to hospital admission compared to 
the previous 7–365 days, which might be preferable in 
certain populations such as in patients undergoing elec￾tive surgery, those with progressive CKD, or those with 
a recent history of AKI.
For patients in whom no pre-morbid serum creati￾nine values are available, various methods for estimat￾ing these values have been studied, including imputing 
previous values41–43. Knowing the strengths and limi￾tations of each approach is key to interpreting future 
study findings. For example, the accuracy of estimating 
a creatinine value using back-calculation from an eGFR 
of 75ml/min/1.73m2
 has been previously studied44. This 
approach is likely the most sensitive for detecting AKI 
among patients with no premorbid serum creatinine 
value and is anticipated to work well in populations with 
largely preserved kidney function. In populations with a
high prevalence of risk factors for CKD, however, this 
method might overestimate the incidence and severity 
of AKI and, therefore, AKD.
Acute kidney disease
AKI is a risk factor for the future loss of kidney function, 
cardiovascular disease, and death11,45–50. Defining optimal 
follow‑up care for this high-risk population is therefore 
essential, especially during the transition of care beyond 
the acute care setting when recovery from AKI and its 
underlying precipitants might be ongoing. In this section, 
we examine surveillance approaches and interventions for 
survivors of AKI from hospital discharge to 90 days after 
the onset of renal dysfunction, identify knowledge gaps 
in the current understanding of AKD and its trajectories, 
and suggest approaches to address these knowledge gaps 
with the aim of defining approaches for the care of these 
individuals. We also propose an operational framework 
for AKD, which integrates with the KDIGO AKI classifi￾cation scheme to characterize changes in kidney function 
or injury that do not meet strict criteria for AKI or CKD, 
including important patient-centred outcomes such as 
renal recovery. Here, we present three key concepts with 
regard to the follow‑up of patients with AKD and a series 
of consensus statements developed through literature 
review and agreement within the ADQI workgroup.
Definition of AKD
AKD is defined as a condition in which AKI stage 1 or 
greater, as defined by KDIGO, is present ≥7 days after an 
AKI initiating event. AKD that persists beyond 90 days 
is considered to be CKD6 (BOX 3).
An AKI initiating event can usually be identi￾fied but is not required to diagnose AKD. Typical 
scenarios in which patients may present with AKD 
Box 3 | Definition of AKD and recovery from AKD
Consensus statement 2A: 
• Acute kidney disease (AKD) describes acute or subacute damage and/or loss of 
kidney function for a duration of between 7 and 90 days after exposure to an acute 
kidney injury (AKI) initiating event.
• Outcomes of AKD include recovery, recurrence of AKI, progression of AKD and/or 
death.
• AKD that persists beyond 90 days is considered to be chronic kidney disease.
Consensus statement 2B:
Recovery from AKD can be operationally defined as a reduction in peak AKI stage 
(based on KDIGO criteria) and can be further refined by change in serum creatinine 
level, glomerular filtration rate, biomarkers of injury or repair, and/or return of renal 
reserve (evidence grade: level 5).
Consensus statement 2C:
The long-term outcomes among patients with AKD are not predetermined and might 
be influenced by care during transition from the acute care setting (evidence grade: 
level 5).
Consensus statement 2D:
The care of patients with AKD after hospital discharge is inadequately characterized. 
Limited observational data suggest that survivors of AKI will be cared for by a diverse 
group of providers, with some patients not receiving timely assessment of kidney 
function, ongoing kidney damage, or associated complications (evidence grade: level 5).
Consensus statement 2E:
Limited evidence exists to guide the practice of routine follow‑up for patients with 
AKD. Standards for the evaluation of kidney function, risk identification, surveillance 
for complications of AKD, and determining whether the risk for future adverse 
outcomes can be reduced are needed (evidence grade: level 5).

include instances in which AKI is observed and the 
patient remains in KDIGO stage 1 or greater after 
7 days; instances in which an episode of AKI was not 
observed (for example, in patients with community￾acquired AKI18), but inferred by the persistence of 
kidney disease beyond 7 days (for patients without a 
known baseline creatinine value, clinical adjudication 
of AKD versus CKD might be required); instances in 
which subacute AKI, documented by either histology, 
imaging, proven biomarkers, or a relevant exposure 
(such as to a nephrotoxin), does not meet criteria for AKI 
or CKD; and instances in which AKI is observed, partially 
improves and then progresses after 7 days17 (FIGS 2,3).
In 2012, the KDIGO AKI workgroup proposed 
the term AKD to define any acute condition that 
impacts kidney function including AKI, eGFR <60ml/
min/1.73m2
, a decrease in GFR by >35%, an increase in 
serum creatinine of >50%, or any kidney damage lasting 
<3 months5
. The goal of this operational definition was 
to “provide an integrated clinical approach to patients 
with acute abnormalities of kidney function and struc￾ture” and help to unify the more established concepts of 
AKI and CKD. Herein, the ADQI workgroup propose a 
new definition of AKD to further refine these criteria; we 
have also added a staging system. Our conceptual frame￾work of AKD attempts to capture the entire spectrum of 
acute and subacute disease (including AKI), beginning 
with the initiation of injury (FIG. 2), as recognized using 
either conventional or novel markers of injury, its evo￾lution, and kidney end points up to 90 days after the 
onset of injury. This updated AKD classification has two 
main features. First, it recognizes an important popula￾tion of patients with evolving kidney disease who might 
not fulfil strict criteria for AKI (or CKD), such as those 
with kidney disease the onset of which is uncertain or 
subacute. Second, it highlights that the process of AKD 
can include AKI and extends beyond mere detection 
and staging of disease through the process of recovery 
or worsening until criteria for incident or worsening 
CKD are reached.
Various hypothetical trajectories of AKI exist 
(FIG. 3); however, important knowledge gaps need to be 
addressed before AKD terminology can be meaning￾fully used in clinical practice51,52 (BOX 4). To date, only 
one study has attempted to characterize AKD using 
kidney biopsy samples53. Although the study findings 
suggest that the distribution of aetiologies that con￾tribute to AKD without AKI might differ from those 
that contribute to AKI alone, the population studied 
(273 patients in China) was selected for clinical indi￾cations for biopsy and is likely not reflective of the

Figure 3 | Hypothetical trajectories of acute kidney disease (AKD). AKD follows on 
from acute kidney injury (AKI) in those patients who do not fully recover within 7 days. 
The trajectory of AKD can take many forms largely depending on the severity of the 
initial AKI episode. Here, a series of hypothetical scenarios representing typical 
trajectories of the AKI–AKD continuum are depicted. Stage 3 AKI might slowly improve 
to stage 2 AKI and then progress to AKD (1). Stage 1 AKI might progress to stage 3, then 
improve rapidly to stage 1 AKI before progressing to stage 1 AKD (2). An episode of 
persistent AKI (>48h) might be followed by a period of sustained reversal(*), then a 
second episode of AKI (‡
) leading to AKD (3). Stage 2 AKI might rapidly reverse (4). 
Subacute AKD might occur wherein the first 7 days are marked with slowly worsening 
renal function that does not technically meet the criteria for AKI, and progress to 
Stage 3 AKD (5). This trajectory can be seen in patients treated with chronic 
nephrotoxic medications (for example, with aminoglycosides). Modified from Acute 
Dialysis Quality Initiative 16; www.adqi.org.

broader population of patients with AKD. Further 
work is warranted to delineate the epidemiology of 
AKD, including differences in the predictors, course, 
and outcomes relative to AKI. Few data exist on char￾acterizing the phases of AKD, including the processes 
by which patients recover or progress to CKD, the 
evolving risk experienced by AKD survivors, and 
the processes of care experienced.
For the purposes of our recommendations, AKD is 
conceptualized not as pre-CKD but rather, as post-AKI. 
This distinction has important implications for the diag￾nosis, care and follow‑up of affected patients, including 
the notion that AKD might exist even in the absence of 
standard clinical evidence (FIGS 2,4).
The ideal definition for recovery should quantify lost 
pre-existing kidney function as well as current residual 
kidney function and reserve, identify when recovery is 
complete, and provide prognostic information (BOX 3). 
Intrinsic to the concept of AKD is that acute loss of kid￾ney function or damage extends beyond diagnosis and 
staging of AKI and highlights additional points of poten￾tial intervention from the onset of injury through to the 
more convalescent phase of disease that could modify 
long-term outcomes. No standardized definition of 
recovery from AKI or AKD exists, and only a few studies 
have evaluated the kinetics or trajectory of recovery from 
either AKI or AKD among patients not on dialysis (see 
Supplementary information S3 (table)). Although these 
studies have used varying time frames and thresholds 
of serum creatinine level to define recovery, the results 
generally show a graded association between recovery 
and future risk of mortality, loss of kidney function, and 
other morbidities.
Other potential measures of recovery
AKD and recovery from AKD are currently assessed 
using filtration markers, such as serum creatinine. This 
approach has limitations, however, and loss of mus￾cle mass, changes in volume of distribution, changes 
in renal reserve, and hyperfiltration can confound the 
assessment of functional recovery54–60. The limitations of 
using serum creatinine to assess recovery are supported 
by observational data indicating that AKI is associated 
with an increased risk of CKD, even when accompanied 
by an apparent complete return of serum creatinine to 
baseline levels61,62.
Alternative or complementary measures of kidney 
function, including other filtration markers such as 
cystatin C and timed urine clearance measurements, 
could hold promise for improved phenotyping of func￾tional recovery from AKD but require further validation 
before recommending their routine adoption into clinical 
practice35,63–66. Methods to assess glomerular functional 
reserve (for example, by assessing the effect of a protein 
load on GFR) or tubular functional reserve (for example, 
through furosemide stress testing or the administration 
of intravenous creatinine) have also been developed in 
the CKD setting but have yet to be applied to patients 
with AKD67,68. Interestingly, serum creatinine level has 
been the standard approach to the assessment of renal 
function for decades, but intravenously administered 
creatinine fails to increase GFR in humans, regardless of 
renal function68. Intravenous creatinine does, however, 
significantly increase creatinine clearance68, demonstrat￾ing that glomerular and tubular reserve do not necessar￾ily correlate and suggesting that patients with CKD can 
maintain some preservation of glomerular renal reserve 
but fail to show any measurable tubular reserve68–71. On 
the basis of these findings, assessments of glomerular and 
tubular reserve are likely to assess different facets of kid￾ney disease. Several studies have also examined the use of 
next-generation biomarkers of tubular injury and furo￾semide stress testing to predict recovery from AKI72,73. 
As many of these markers reflect ongoing tubular injury, 
most studies have focused on their ability to indicate the 
likelihood of recovery during early or peak AKI in select 
groups of patients (see Supplementary information S4 
(table)). Further work is needed to determine the utility of 
these biomarkers in informing clinical decision-making.
A framework to classify AKD and recovery
A useful classification of recovery from AKD would 
quantify the extent to which kidney function was lost, 
indicate when repair is complete and damage is no longer 
occurring, provide a measure of a patient’s current kidney 
function and reserve, and provide prognostic information. 
A scheme that aligns with and integrates the KDIGO 
categories for AKI and provides a simple and translatable 
framework for ascertaining transition points for outcomes 
during AKD and at the end of 90 days would be ideal. 
Accordingly, we propose to map the KDIGO AKI stag￾ing categories to the staging of AKD for the purpose of 
defining the severity of AKD and to offer a framework for 
kidney-specific outcomes across a 90‑day timeline (FIG. 4). 
In this conceptual framework, improvements in kidney 
function and/or resolution in kidney damage would be 
staged by an improvement (decrease) in AKD stage (for 
example, a shift from stage 3 AKD to stage 2 or lower). 
We recognize that specific thresholds to define ‘recovery’ 
remain to be defined, in particular in selected populations 
Figure 4 | Interplay between acute kidney injury (AKI), acute kidney disease (AKD) 
and chronic kidney disease (CKD). AKI stages map directly to the new proposed AKD 
stages. In addition, patients with AKD can progress to CKD. Stage 0 AKD represents 
partial recovery from AKI. Stage 0C includes patients for whom serum creatinine levels 
are higher than baseline but within 1.5 times baseline levels. Stage 0B includes patients 
whose serum creatinine has returned to baseline levels, but who still have evidence of 
ongoing kidney damage, injury, or loss of renal reserve. Stage 0A includes those patients 
who have had an episode of AKI and retain a risk of long-term events without structural 
or damage markers for AKD. Patients whose serum creatinine level has not returned to 
baseline and who have ongoing evidence of kidney damage and/or injury are termed 
stage 0B/C.

such as survivors of critical illness or among patients who 
no longer fulfil criteria for AKI or AKD stage 1 but whose 
serum creatinine level has not yet returned to baseline62,74. 
In this framework, we propose a ‘stage 0ʹ, with A, B, and C 
subgroups (TABLE 1). Stage 0C includes patients for whom 
serum creatinine levels are higher than baseline but within 
1.5 times baseline levels. Population studies suggest that 
these patients who achieve a recovery serum creatinine 
level that remains above 115% of baseline levels still carry 
a mortality risk74. Thus, these patients with AKD might 
require further follow‑up and could be candidates for 
future therapeutic intervention. Stage 0B includes patients 
whose serum creatinine has returned to their baseline 
level after an episode of AKI, but still have evidence of 
ongoing kidney damage. The diagnosis of this ongoing 
damage for most patients will likely be in the form of 
new-onset proteinuria, worsened proteinuria from base￾line, new-onset hypertension, or worsening hypertension. 
In addition to proteinuria and hypertension, evidence of 
ongoing kidney disease might be assessed through use 
of biomarkers or imaging studies. Stage 0B also includes 
patients for whom serum creatinine level has returned 
to baseline after an episode of AKI with no evidence of 
ongoing kidney damage, but who have experienced a loss 
of renal reserve. One example of this scenario would be a 
patient who has undergone a nephrectomy, whereby the 
contralateral kidney might adapt to the loss of renal mass, 
but a significant portion of renal reserve has nonetheless 
been lost. The assessment of renal reserve can be assessed 
by both glomerular and tubular stress testing75. Patients 
in whom serum creatinine levels fail to return to baseline 
and have evidence of ongoing injury would be classified 
as having Stage 0B/C. As the study of AKD is nascent, 
future research should carefully assess the risk of future 
events associated with these AKD stages (BOX 4). In addi￾tion, the thresholds of the various biomarkers, imaging 
outputs, and/or renal reserve that define ‘full recovery’ 
versus ongoing risk is not known and will require further 
investigation. Stage 0A encompasses patients who have no 
evidence of damage or functional loss following an AKI 
episode and represents clinical recovery. These patients 
may nonetheless be vulnerable to further kidney damage 
and other adverse events. As has been shown previously, 
patients who have suffered an AKI event and ‘recover’ still 
carry a long-term increased risk of major adverse cardiac 
and kidney events49,76. Patients with AKD stage 0A might 
still require follow‑up and could likely benefit from avoid￾ing unnecessary nephrotoxic drugs. We hypothesize that 
this framework will enable the recognition and descrip￾tion of the dynamic nature of AKI and AKD beyond the 
initial diagnosis and staging of kidney injury, which will 
enable improved understanding of the natural course of
the disease and ultimately facilitate the development 
of specific care pathways to guide surveillance, investi￾gation and interventions, and align with care beyond 
90 days. However, the accuracy and usefulness of these 
proposed stages in assessing kidney function and damage 
in patients with AKD requires further validation.
Finally, in keeping with the original conceptual 
framework for AKD as proposed by KDIGO, we rec￾ognize that AKI might not have always been diagnosed 
in a patient who appears to have an acute deterioration 
in renal function. In other words, the diagnosis of AKD 
may require inference of the existence of an episode of 
AKI. For example, consider a patient who is seen for an 
annual internist visit. The patient’s serum creatinine is 
found to be twice the level observed the year before and 
they describe a severe ‘flu-like’ illness 2 months prior that 
lasted a week but eventually resolved without medical 
attention. We would suggest that treating this situation 
as a likely case of AKD — for example, by requesting that 
the patient avoids unnecessary nephrotoxins, requesting 
follow‑up serum creatinine measurements, and screening
for CKD risk factors — would be reasonable.
Follow-up care
As the evidence linking AKI with loss of kidney func￾tion45–47,77–80, hypertension81,82, cardiovascular dis￾ease49,50,83, and death46,83–87 accumulates, determining 
the optimal care for this growing population is critical. 
The American Society of Nephrology AKI Advisory 
Group has highlighted the transition of care as a poten￾tial opportunity to reduce the long-term impact of AKI88, 
and hence, AKD. However, a paucity of data exists to 
indicate which interventions can reduce morbidity and 
mortality in AKI/AKD survivors.

Intensity of kidney function monitoring
A first step in developing effective care strategies 
is to understand how care during follow‑up associates 
with long-term outcomes. One element that has been 
examined is which physicians care for patients with AKI 
following hospital discharge. Studies indicate that most 
survivors of AKI are not cared for by nephrologists89–92. 
Although data derived largely from observational 
cohort studies suggest that referral to nephrology care 
is associated with improved survival93, causality remains 
to be proven and the elements of care that drive this 
potential benefit have not been identified. Identifying 
the driver(s) of beneficial outcomes is of critical rele￾vance as rapid growth in the incidence of AKD means 
that most survivors will be cared for initially by primary 
care physicians.
One potential process of care that might confer 
benefit during follow‑up is close monitoring of kidney 
function. Currently, a lack of evidence exists to guide 
the timing, frequency, and methods to evaluate kidney 
function among patients following an episode of AKI. 
Current KDIGO guidelines recommend that patients are 
evaluated “3 months after AKI for resolution, new onset, 
or worsening of pre-existing CKD”. Data from Medicare 
claims and the Veterans Affairs database indicate that 
only 50–69% of patients have a serum creatinine level 
measured within 3 months of an episode of AKI and 
that assessment of proteinuria occurs even more infre￾quently94,95. We recommend that the intensity of sur￾veillance should be proportionate to the risk of future 
outcomes (FIG. 5). For example, patients who have more 
severe or persistent AKD11,96, those with premorbid con￾ditions that increase the risk of future CKD progression 
(for example, those with evidence of pre-existing CKD, 
diabetes and/or proteinuria), and those with recurrent 
disease or non-recovery (for example, those with con￾gestive heart failure, cirrhosis, and/or malignancy with 
or without chemotherapy) might achieve greater benefit 
from earlier or more frequent surveillance than patients 
with a lower risk of future CKD97,98. This hypothesis is 
supported by data showing that rates of re‑hospitaliza￾tion and recurrent AKI are high among patients with 
similar risk factors95,98–104.
We propose a conceptual ‘layered’ approach to the 
follow‑up care of patients with AKD whereby the intensity 
of care rises in proportion to the risk of intermediate and 
long-term morbidity and mortality (FIGS 5,6). Improving 
patient awareness of AKD and conditions or symptoms 
that might require evaluation of kidney function (such as 
oedema and volume-depleting illness), documenting that 
AKI and/or AKD has occurred particularly if moderate 
to severe or persistent, and processes of care including 
medication reconciliation to facilitate appropriate dosing 
and nephrotoxin avoidance, might help to alert future care 
providers to the risk of AKD, reduce the risk of adverse 
events including recurrent AKI, and potentially improve 
the probability of recovery88,105–107 (BOX 4). Many of these 
elements of care are being examined and tested in pro￾spective studies using ‘post-AKI’ care clinics that might 
better characterize which specific elements of care are 
most beneficial, which patients are most likely to benefit 
from different interventions, and the overall impact and 
cost of specialized care for patients with AKD108.
RRT recommendations for patients with CKD
The decision of when to initiate RRT is not standard￾ized between countries, institutions or even between 
individual physicians within a group practice. Although 
initiation of RRT is usually associated with serious renal 
dysfunction corresponding to stage 3 AKI as defined 
by KDIGO, some instances exist in which RRT is initi￾ated in the setting of non-severe renal dysfunction, for 
example, in the setting of electrolyte disturbances, fluid 
overload, toxic ingestions or poisoning. Thus, database 
studies that use RRT as an indicator of severe AKI might 
also include a small proportion of patients with less 
severe AKI. Nonetheless, the approach of using RRT as 
a marker of AKI severity has yielded consistent findings 
across more than 1 million patients assessed worldwide 
and remains an excellent surrogate for severe AKI in 
database studies5
.
Assessing recovery from RRT dependence
Although current definitions for the recovery of patients 
from dialysis-dependent AKI are diverse and subjective, 
a unifying characteristic is sustained independence from 
RRT87,109,110. We suggest that organ (kidney) recovery in 
patients who have received acute RRT be defined as 
sustained independence from RRT for a minimum of 
14 days (BOX 5). This definition is not to say that inde￾pendence from RRT cannot be assessed before 14 days 
and we appreciate that researchers might use various 
means to adjudicate independence from RRT before 
hospital discharge. However for individual patient care, 
we recommend close follow‑up after hospital discharge to 
ensure that independence from RRT is indeed sustained.
In order to assess recovery from dialysis-dependent 
AKD, we suggest that laboratory and clinical evaluation 
after cessation of acute RRT should occur within 3 days 
(and no later than 7 days) after the last RRT session, 
and be followed by regular and frequent assessments 
Figure 5 | A layered approach to the follow‑up of patients with acute kidney disease 
(AKD). The severity of AKD should determine the frequency and intensity of follow‑up 
care. Patients with more severe AKD should receive nephrology follow‑up if feasible. Key 
modifiers that should prompt more frequent follow‑up and assessment of kidney function 
are the presence of pre-existing chronic kidney disease, congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, 
and/or malignancy. Modified from Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative 16; www.adqi.org.

thereafter. The interval for subsequent assessments 
should be based upon clinical judgment. We suggest that 
issues such as maintenance of dialysis access, medication 
reconciliation and evaluation of the appropriateness of 
medications and their dosing should be addressed at 
each clinical assessment. The patient’s outpatient record 
should clearly state that the patient had RRT-requiring 
AKI and include a plan for outpatient care that includes 
measurement and documentation of kidney function. 
Furthermore, continued follow‑up with a nephrologist 
is recommended.
For patients who are discharged while still receiving 
RRT, frequent review and documentation of kidney 
function should occur to assess the continued need 
for RRT. At a minimum, these reviews should include 
a weekly assessment of serial pre-dialysis serum creati￾nine values and regular assessment of residual kidney 
function using a 24h urine collection to assess volume 
of urine output as well as creatinine and urea clearance. 
Careful consideration should be given to the temporary 
acute vascular access site, with avoidance of subclavian 
veins and the internal jugular vein on the side of a future 
potential arteriovenous fistula. Importantly, if the patient 
is discharged from the hospital to a chronic dialysis facil￾ity, the treating team should be informed that a person￾alized approach that maximizes the likelihood of renal 
recovery should be utilized. Specifically, avoidance of 
excessive fluid removal and hypotension are critical 
to prevent re-injury to the kidney and to enhance the 
likelihood of renal recovery.
We contend that the therapeutic goal for patients 
recovering from an episode of RRT-requiring AKI 
should be recovery of functional status to pre-morbid
levels. Assessment of kidney function in patients who 
received RRT and recovered to RRT independence 
must take into account loss of muscle mass and its 
impact on standard markers of GFR such as serum 
creatinine29. The use of alternative markers of GFR 
that are not sensitive to muscle mass (for example, 
cystatin C) or the direct quantification of GFR (with 
iohexol clearance, for instance), should be considered 
in selected cases37.
Predicting outcomes
We suggest that novel biomarkers and approaches to the
direct measurement of GFR might be valuable for 
the evaluation of kidney recovery among patients receiv￾ing RRT (BOXES 5,6). Pending the development of such 
tools, the utility of available markers, such as urine

when to change the dose, discontinue, and potentially re‑introduce medications that are 
affected by kidney function and/or that are nephrotoxic. Assessment of renal function 
with use of biomarkers, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) measurement, and imaging should 
be performed across all stages of AKD as clinically indicated. Different possible scenarios 
are illustrated as follows: AKD begins to improve early in the clinical course (1); AKD is 
more entrenched, and kidney function improves only after a considerable decline in 
kidney function (2); AKD takes a severe course with kidney function recovery occurring 
after an extended decline in kidney function (3); severe AKD with progression to renal 
replacement therapy (4). Modified from Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative 16; www.adqi.org.

output, timed creatinine and/or urea clearances, to aid 
the prediction of successful RRT cessation should be 
studied further.
Data on the effect of patient characteristics on 
outcomes and on how to use these factors to influ￾ence decision making are currently limited (BOX 5). 
Observational studies have identified several risk 
factors for non-recovery 48,111–117 (see Supplementary 
information S5 (table)). Novel modalities that might 
enhance the prediction of non-recovery, including 
urine and plasma biomarkers, histopathologic markers 
on kidney biopsy specimens and imaging tools, should 
be carefully studied (BOX 6). Regardless of the markers 
that are chosen, all assessments for non-recovery of 
kidney function must be analysed, while accounting 
for the competing risk of death.
It is possible that the operational characteristics of 
RRT might influence renal and patient recovery. Only 
limited high quality data exist on the effects of opera￾tional characteristics of RRT on recovery of kidney func￾tion among patients with RRT-dependent AKD87,118–123
(BOX 5; TABLE 2). Findings from a single randomized trial 
suggest that utilization of strict guidelines to improve 
therapy tolerance and metabolic control renders inter￾mittent RRT comparable to continuous RRT123. We fur￾ther acknowledge that numerous other factors involved 
in the process of care might influence renal recovery 
among patients with dialysis-dependent AKD73,124
(see Supplementary information S6 (table)).
Drug dosing during AKD
The selection and dosing of drugs in patients with AKD 
requires multiple and dynamic assessments, in which 
understanding of the phases of AKD, including the 
timing of the initial insult, and the likelihood of AKD 
reversal, persistence, recovery and/or progression to 
CKD should prompt clinical review of prescribed medi￾cations (BOX 7; FIGS 5,6). Assessment of the medication 
regimen comprises several components (TABLE 3). The 
disposition and effects of drugs administered to patients 
with AKD are modulated by a number of factors, includ￾ing changes in drug clearance (which is dependent on 
glomerular and tubular function, and non-renal drug 
metabolism), and altered pharmacokinetic parameters 
due to decreased kidney function (for example, vol￾ume overload and metabolic acidosis). In addition, the 
mechanism of nephrotoxicity, whether from direct 
tubular toxicity (such as caused by aminoglycosides), reno￾vasoconstriction (such as caused by NSAIDs and radio￾contrast media), interstitial nephritis (such as caused by
NSAIDs and β‑lactams) or crystallization (as caused 
by acyclovir), should be considered in the context of 
the functional phase of AKD. For example, withholding 
NSAIDs might make sense while a patient is in the per￾sistent or recovery phase of AKD whereas careful dosing 
and monitoring of aminoglycosides to prevent re‑injury 
in the recovery phase of AKI might be warranted.
Factors that must be taken into account when select￾ing a treatment regimen include considerations as to the
mode of drug excretion (renal versus non-renal); 
the potential for nephrotoxicity; the effect of AKD on drug 
metabolites and/or the effect of AKD on the non-renal 
metabolism of drugs; the strength of indications and/or
urgency for their use; and the availability of suitable 
alternatives (BOX 7).
The relevance of each of these considerations for a 
particular drug is likely to vary, and once again, should 
be taken in the context of the AKD stage, with reas￾sessment as patients transition from one AKD stage to 
another, including the identification of patients who 
are at risk of nephrotoxicity before exposure to the 
toxic agent. For instance, avoidance of nephrotoxic 
medications such as aminoglycosides or NSAIDs 
in a patient at risk of AKI (such as in patients with 
CKD, a previous history of AKI, or in those who are 
already taking multiple nephrotoxic medications), 
who is admitted to the ICU would make sense, unless 
that medication is clearly superior in terms of effi￾cacy and no suitable alternative exists. Early in the 
AKI course when GFR is starting to fall, a systematic 
reassessment of drug dosing, surveillance of drug con￾centrations when available, and avoidance of nephro￾toxic medications or drugs with a renovascular effect 
should be undertaken. Various factors relating to drug 
avoidance or the reintroduction of drugs in various 
AKD stages need to be considered (BOX 8; TABLES 3,4). 
Below, we discuss considerations relevant to 
angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and 
Box 6 | Research recommendations for the study of patients with RRT-requiring AKI
Consensus Statement 3F:
• Future research should aim to determine the optimal time to define sustained independence from renal replacement 
therapy (RRT) and to develop and validate functional assessment tools for this population.
• Strategies to accurately assess endogenous kidney function among patients receiving acute RRT are urgently needed. 
Candidate biomarkers and real-time assessment of glomerular filtration rate should be evaluated for this purpose.
• Derivation and validation of a clinical risk score to predict RRT dependence at 90 days (and possibly at subsequent 
time points) would be a valuable tool for patients and clinicians. A search for potentially modifiable risk factors should 
be prioritized as these might represent therapeutic targets for the preservation of kidney function following 
RRT-requiring AKI.
• Future studies involving RRT interventions should focus on kidney recovery as an important outcome measure. Clinical 
trials in which kidney recovery is an end point should follow patients for a minimum of 90 days. Interventions that focus 
on ultrafiltration intensity, fluid balance, cardiovascular stability and optimal antibiotic dosage have the most plausible 
likelihood of influencing renal recovery and should be prioritized.

angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs), two nearly 
ubiquitously prescribed medications with renovascular
effects.
ACE inhibitors and ARBs
At present the armamentarium available for facili￾tating the transition from AKI to recovery is limited 
and the decision to restrict therapies might reflect the 
nephrotoxic potential of some drugs. Perhaps the most 
relevant examples are ACE inhibitors and ARBs, which 
are associated with functional AKI, particularly in the 
setting of acute hypovolaemia5,125–127. These agents are 
frequently prescribed, particularly in the elderly 128. 
A 2013 study from the UK that used routinely collected 
national hospital administrative data showed that a 16% 
increase in ACE inhibitor and ARB prescribing between 
2007 and 2011 corresponded with a 50% increase in the 
number of hospital admissions complicated by AKI in 
Box 7 | Recommendations for the dosing of drugs among patients with AKD
Consensus Statement 4A:
Drug selection, dosing and monitoring among patients with acute kidney disease (AKD) should be guided by the 
functional phase, trajectory, and stage of AKD as informed by available pertinent data, with the aim to personalize clinical 
decision-making (evidence grade: level 5).
Consensus Statement 4B:
• The decision to discontinue, introduce and/or reintroduce medications in patients with AKD should be individualized 
(evidence grade: level 5).
• Considerations in selecting a treatment regimen include:
- Renal versus non-renal excretion
- Potential for nephrotoxicity
- Effect of AKD on metabolites and/or the effect of AKD on the non-renal metabolism of drugs
- The strength of indications and/or urgency for use of the drug
- The availability of suitable alternatives.
Consensus statement 4C:
Ideally, nephrotoxic medications or combinations should be avoided in patients with AKD. When nephrotoxic 
medications are needed for clinically compelling reasons, efforts should be made to mitigate their nephrotoxic effects 
with special attention placed on avoiding administering multiple nephrotoxic medications concomitantly when possible 
(evidence grade: level 5).

the same time period129. Although ACE inhibitors and 
ARBs have benefits, the risk–benefit ratio in patients 
with AKD might not reflect that observed in routine 
clinical practice. Whether stopping these drugs during 
periods of AKI and/or AKD results in better outcomes, 
or how often and at what stage they should be restarted 
following recovery from AKI and/or AKD is not known.
Despite recommendations that ACE inhibitors and 
ARBs are routinely stopped during any intercurrent 
illness130, sparse evidence exists to support these recom￾mendations131. Two studies in which these agents were 
not re‑started in patients after surgery demonstrated an 
increase in 30 day mortality, possibly from hypertensive 
rebound leading to acute cardiac decompensation132,133. 
Re‑introduction of ACE inhibitors and ARBs in acute 
illness is usually considered when GFR has stabilized and 
volume status is optimized. Hypotension and decreased 
filtration fraction are recognized as common adverse 
effects associated with ACE inhibitor and ARB use 
that can cause or exacerbate AKI, and the risk–benefit
ratio for their use in patients with AKD must be care￾fully considered and therapy personalized according 
to the individual risks of the patient. Although chronic 
tolerance to reversible decrements in filtration fraction 
and GFR caused by ACE inhibitors and ARBs might 
be desirable in patients with chronic heart failure and 
CKD, such effects might not be tolerable and are with￾out proven benefit in patients with AKD. Similarly,

Box 8 | Considerations for nephrotoxin management in patients with AKD
When to avoid starting a nephrotoxin
• Patient has known risk factors for kidney injury (that is, advanced age, previous acute kidney injury (AKI) episode, 
chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, proteinuria or hypertension).
• A suitable and less nephrotoxic drug is available.
• The nephrotoxin is considered non-essential.
• The patient is already receiving a nephrotoxic drug and concern exists regarding a pharmacokinetic or 
pharmacodynamic drug interaction.
• Intended duration of the drug therapy is chronic and initiation of the drug can be delayed until after the acute kidney 
disease (AKD) episode has resolved. 
• Concern exists for a lack of appropriate follow‑up of serum creatinine level and/or therapeutic drug concentration 
monitoring.
When to discontinue a nephrotoxin
• An evaluation of causal relationship indicates that the nephrotoxin is the potential cause of AKI and/or AKD.
• A suitable and less nephrotoxic drug is available.
• The nephrotoxin is considered non-essential.
Other considerations for nephrotoxin management
• Regular monitoring of functional status while on a nephrotoxin is needed.
• The duration and dose of nephrotoxin exposure should be minimized, if possible.
• Evidence-based dosing guidelines should be followed.

effective drugs in patients with AKD (particularly in 
the recovery phase), such therapeutic failure is rarely 
recorded134.
Effect of AKI and AKD on drug metabolism
The effects of CKD on drug metabolism and subsequent 
dosing regimens are well established but little is known 
about the effects of AKI or AKD on drug metabolism135. 
Extrapolation of data from patients with CKD is not 
ideal given that the time course of disease progression 
is different. Organ crosstalk, particularly involving the 
liver and the kidney, can influence drug metabolism135, 
which could reflect the impact of AKI on hepatic blood 
flow, the consequences of metabolic acidosis or changes 
in protein binding 136 on drug distribution, and the 
increasingly recognized effects of AKI on cytochrome 
P450 activity; overall, the impact of AKI on hepatic drug 
metabolism seems to be clinically relevant. Impairment 
of cytochrome P450 activity, as well as effects on 
drug transporters, could also account for some of the 
pharmacodynamic effects of AKI.
Nephrotoxin management during AKD
In developed countries, drugs account for 20% of 
community-acquired AKI episodes that result in hospi￾talization137,138. Drug-associated AKI (DA‑AKI) occurs 
in approximately 25% of critically ill patients, making 
drugs a common cause of AKI in the ICU28,139,140. The 
consequences of DA‑AKI are severe, with rates of dialy￾sis dependence and/or risk of mortality similar to those 
of AKI resulting from other aetiologies (40–50%)140. 
Early reversal of AKI from other aetiologies leads to 
improved survival compared to that of patients with 
persistent AKI or new-onset AKI, suggesting that 
early reversal of DA‑AKI might also be associated with 
improved outcomes14.
Evaluation of nephrotoxins as a plausible cause of AKI 
is the first consideration in the management of medi￾cations for patients with AKI. Determining nephrotoxic 
causality involves assessment of the temporal sequence 
between administration and the onset of injury, other 
possible causes, response to the removal of a drug, and 
in some cases the effects of restarting the drug141. In 
all phases of AKD, selection of a less nephrotoxic drug 
and/or avoidance of a nephrotoxin should be the goal. 
This approach is supported by the fact that each nephro￾toxin administration presents a 53% greater odds of 
developing AKI142, and is compounded when patients 
receive more than one nephrotoxin143. Combining 
nephrotoxins can result in pharmacodynamic drug 
interactions, such as the ‘triple whammy’ of NSAIDs, 
diuretics and ACE inhibitors or ARBs125. In the non-ICU 
setting, escalating the burden of nephrotoxic medica￾tions from two to three medications more than doubles 
the risk of developing AKI, and 25% of non-critically ill 
patients who receive three or more nephrotoxins develop 
AKI88,144. Pharmacokinetic drug interactions arising 
from the administration of some macrolide antibiotics 
(such as clarithromycin or erythromycin) together with a 
3‑hydroxy‑3‑methylglutaryl-coenzyme‑A (HMG-CoA) 
reductase inhibitor (statin) result in a greater number 
of hospitalizations for AKI from rhabdomyolysis, than 
those arising from administration of azithromycin 
(a macrolide that does not powerfully inhibit 
cytochrome p450 enzyme CYP 3A4 and therefore impair 
statin clearance)145.
An evaluation of the appropriate timing to admin￾ister a drug assumes that a nephrotoxin is essential 
for the patient. The treatment of an infection with an 
antibiotic that is necessary for survival should begin 
immediately, and might prevent or ameliorate AKI. 
Determining whether nephrotoxins are a possible

cause or contributor to AKI requires thorough eval￾uation146,147. The persistent phase of AKD necessitates 
the continued consideration of nephrotoxin avoidance. 
During the recovery phase of AKD, caution should 
still be applied to nephrotoxin initiation, to prevent 
re‑injury.
A general statement cannot be made about a func￾tional threshold at which to avoid or discontinue 
nephrotoxins. The recommendations provided in 
package inserts or guidelines specific to a drug or drug 
class might offer guidance. For example, combination 
trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole treatment is not 
recommended if creatinine clearance is <15 ml/min. 
The revised Beers criteria for potentially inappropriate 
medication use in older adults indicate moderate evi￾dence to support NSAID avoidance in elderly patients 
with creatinine clearance <30ml/min (REF. 148).
Detection and management of nephrotoxins at the 
initiation of AKI146,147,149–151 and during CKD152,153 have 
been well described but fewer data exist for nephro￾toxin management during AKD. Two groups reported 
together on a multicomponent medical management 
approach to patients following an episode of AKI, 
including the management of drugs. Patients are edu￾cated to avoid taking NSAIDs (or any new medications) 
without consulting their nephrologist, and to use ACE 
inhibitors, decongestants, antivirals, antibiotics and 
herbal products with caution108.
Conclusions
AKD represents an important transition period for patients 
who have suffered an episode of AKI. Considerable 
advances have been made in our collective understand￾ing of AKI and CKD; however, the relationship between 
these two conditions is vitally important because these two 
syndromes are interconnected. One of the most significant 
risk factors for AKI is pre-existing CKD, and AKI is a sig￾nificant risk factor for the development of CKD as well as 
the progression of pre-existing CKD4
. A critical period of 
vulnerability for patients who develop AKI is in the imme￾diate period following development of AKI — a period 
previously labelled AKD. In this manuscript, the ADQI 
workgroup offers a series of proposed definitions and rec￾ommendations that aim to increase awareness of AKD and 
encourage research that will guide future understanding of 
the epidemiology, mechanisms and management of AKD.
As we have proposed new definitions, provided guid￾ance for clinical practice and put forth a large agenda 
for future research, it will be incumbent on the AKI 
clinical research community to test our recommenda￾tions. Importantly, as many patients with AKI present 
to the hospital with ongoing AKI, a critical intervention 
point to facilitate recovery and minimize continuing 
damage will occur during AKD. As such, the ADQI 16 
workgroup advocates a sense of urgency behind both 
the adoption of our clinical recommendations and the 
execution of the proposed research agenda.
