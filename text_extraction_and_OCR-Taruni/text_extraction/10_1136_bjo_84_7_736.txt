Abstract
BACKGROUND/AIMS Simultaneous pancreas and kidney
transplantation (SPK) has become an important option in selected


IDDM patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD). Successful SPK
transplants are associated with long term normoglycaemic control
and improved quality of life. However, debate still continues on the
benefit to patients in terms of stabilisation or amelioration of
diabetic retinopathy. The progression of diabetic retinopathy (DR)
in a cohort of 20 SPK transplant patients is reported.
METHODS All patients were reviewed postoperatively with
corrected visual acuity, slit lamp examination, and fundal
biomicroscopy. Preoperative data were collected retrospectively and
DR was considered unstable if there had been a drop in Snellen
acuity greater than three lines or a need for laser photocoagulation
or vitrectomy in the 2 years preoperatively.
RESULTS 20 patients who received SPK transplants between March
1983 and April 1994 were reviewed (mean age 35.1 years; mean
duration of IDDM = 24.6 years). 17 patients still had functioning
grafts at a mean follow up of 5.1 years. Nine of these patients had
unstable DR before transplantation. Of these, 89% (8/9) had
stabilised DR following transplantation with only a single case
requiring laser photocoagulation. Of the eight patients that had
stable DR before transplantation all had stable DR following
transplantation. 41% of cases (7/17) required cataract surgery
during the follow up period.
CONCLUSIONS Advanced diabetic retinopathy is present in a high
proportion of cases managed with SPK transplant as a consequence
of the duration of IDDM and the presence of ESRD. More than 90%
of cases have stable DR following transplant.
