Abstract
Objective: To describe aspects of the natural history and
pathophysiology of giant low pressure pulmonary artery aneurysms
and to propose potential surgical strategies.
Design: Cross sectional retrospective review.
Setting: Supraregional tertiary referral centre.
Patients: All adult patients referred for assessment of giant
pulmonary artery aneurysm retrospectively identified from the
Mayo Adult Congenital Heart Disease Clinic database.
Methods: Patient data were reviewed from hospital records,
including echocardiograms, magnetic resonance images,
radiographs, and histology slides.
Results: Four patients were identified with a median age of 52
years (range 37–64 years). Presenting symptoms were effort related
dyspnoea, chest discomfort, and hoarseness in one patient. All
patients had pulmonary regurgitation and clinical evidence of right
ventricular enlargement in association with a pulsatile mass at the
upper left sternal edge. Transthoracic echocardiography showed the
giant pulmonary artery aneurysm involving the main pulmonary
artery and proximal branches, and confirmed severe pulmonary
regurgitation in all patients. None of the patients had intimal
tearing, medial dissection, or pulmonary arterial rupture. The
pulmonary valve was replaced to relieve symptoms and preserve
right ventricular function. Pulmonary arterial histology showed
medial degeneration of elastic fibres with accumulation of
basophilic ground substance.
Conclusions: Rupture or dissection of these low pressure
aneurysms is rare. The timing of surgical intervention should be
determined by changes in right ventricular size and function
resulting from pulmonary regurgitation or pulmonary stenosis, and
not the size of the aneurysm.
