Background: Hypercholesterolaemia often occurs in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) as a result of chronic
cholestasis, but whether these patients are exposed to greater cardiovascular risk is unknown.
Aim: To establish whether hypercholesterolaemia is associated with subclinical atherosclerosis in PBC.
Patients: 103 consecutive patients with PBC (37 with total cholesterol >6.21 mmol/l) and 37 controls with
hypercholesterolaemia, and 141 matched controls with normocholesterolaemia.
Methods: Ultrasound imaging of carotid artery to determine intima–media thickness (IMT) and stenosis.
Results: Controls with hypercholesterolaemia had higher IMT and prevalence of carotid stenosis compared
with patients with hypercholesterolaemic PBC (mean (SD) 0.850 (0.292) mm v 0.616 (0.137) mm,
pc,0.001; 43% v 19%, pc = 0.129) who, in turn, were similar to the 66 patients with normocholester￾olaemic PBC (0.600 (0.136) mm; 5%). Compared with subjects with normocholesterolaemia, controls with
hypercholesterolaemia, but not patients with hypercholesterolaemic PBC, had an increased risk of raised
IMT (odds ratio (OR) 5.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.5 to 11.9, p,0.001; and 0.7, 0.3 to 2.0,
p = 0.543) or carotid stenosis (8.2, 3.4 to 20, p,0.001; and 2.5, 0.9 to 6.9, p = 0.075). In PBC,
compared with younger patients without hypertension, the risk of increased IMT was OR (CI) 3.1 (0.6 to
17; p = 0.192) in patients with hypertension or old age, but not hypercholesterolaemia, and 4.6 (0.8 to
27; p = 0.096) in patients who also had hypercholesterolaemia. The corresponding figures for risk of
stenosis were 3.6 (0.4 to 36; p = 0.277) and 15.8 (1.8 to 141; p = 0.014).
Conclusions: Hypercholesterolaemia is not consistently associated with subclinical atherosclerosis in PBC,
but should be treated if other risk factors for cardiovascular disease are also present. The search for factors
that may protect patients with hypercholesterolaemic PBC against atherosclerosis should be encouraged.
P
rimary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is a chronic cholestatic
disease characterised by immune-mediated, progressive
damage of intrahepatic bile ducts.1 2 With our advancing
awareness of the disease, most patients are being recognised
with increasing frequency at an earlier stage than in the past,
and survive several decades after the diagnosis.3
As a result of chronic cholestasis, hypercholesterolaemia is
a common finding in patients with PBC, but it is still unclear
whether longstanding lipoprotein elevation entails increased
cardiovascular risk in this disease and, therefore, should be
treated.4–7 In the past, a few studies have investigated
mortality from cardiovascular disease in patients with PBC,
suggesting that the frequency of fatal cardiovascular events
may not be increased.6 8 We have recently evaluated the
incidence of clinically relevant, both fatal and non-fatal,
cardiovascular events in PBC showing that the hypercholes￾terolaemia in these patients is not associated with an excess
risk.7 However, we also pointed out that in a chronic,
longlasting but ultimately fatal disease such as PBC, studies
based on such outcome measures are subject to bias due to
selective removal of patients dying from liver-related causes.
In the presence of competing causes of death, the use of early
markers of cardiovascular disease as surrogate end points for
atherosclerosis seems necessary to ascertain the clinical effect
of hypercholesterolaemia in PBC.
Measurement of the intima–media thickness (IMT) of the
carotid artery by B-mode ultrasound imaging has emerged as
a safe, non-invasive and relatively inexpensive means of
assessing subclinical atherosclerosis.9–12 IMT of the carotid
artery was shown to be associated with the presence of
cardiovascular risk factors and with the prevalence and
incidence of cardiovascular disease.
By using ultrasound imaging of the carotid artery, we
sought to determine whether in PBC, hypercholesterolaemia
is associated with a substantial risk of cardiovascular disease
by assessing the presence of initial atherosclerotic lesions.
METHODS
Study populations
We studied 103 patients with PBC who consecutively
presented to the School of Medicine Ospedale San Paolo,
University of Milan, Milan, Italy, for follow-up evaluation, or
first visited between September 2001 and September 2003.
PBC was diagnosed on the basis of the usual biochemical,
serological, clinical and histological criteria.13
We selected 101 healthy subjects matched for age and sex
with the patients with PBC. Subjects were excluded if they
had a family history of premature cardiovascular disease
(coronary heart disease, peripheral arterial disease, abdom￾inal aortic aneurysm or symptomatic carotid artery disease in
male first-degree relatives before the age of 55 years, or in
female first-degree relatives before the age of 65 years), a
smoking habit of .10 cigarettes/day, cardiovascular disease,
hypertension (blood pressure of >140/90 mm Hg, or current
use of drugs for hypertension), diabetes mellitus (fasting
serum glucose concentration >7.0 mmol/l, non-fasting glu￾cose concentration >11.1 mmol/l or current use of drugs
for diabetes), hypercholesterolaemia (serum cholesterol
concentration >6.21 mmol/l, or currently receiving choles￾terol-lowering treatment), a history of anticoagulant or

antiaggregant use, anaemia (haemoglobin ,110 g/l in
women or ,120 g/l in men), thrombocytosis (platelet count
of .5006109
/l), vasculitis, a serum creatinine concentration
.133 mmol/l, alcohol or drug dependence, or substantial
coexisting medical conditions.
We also enrolled 40 patients with chronic hepatitis C who
attended the School of Medicine Ospedale San Paolo,
University of Milan, Milan, Italy, during the same period.
They were matched for age, sex and stage of liver disease
with the PBC group. Patients were excluded according to the
same criteria used for the group of controls. As serum lipid
levels and ultrasound imaging measurements were remark￾ably similar in controls and patients with chronic hepatitis C,
the 141 subjects from the two groups were considered as a
single control group.
Finally, we studied 37 patients with hypercholesterolaemia
(serum cholesterol >6.21 mmol/l) who presented as out￾patients to the Centre for Hyperlipidaemic Disease, School of
Medicine Ospedale San Paolo, University of Milan, Milan,
Italy, during the same period. These patients were matched
for age, sex and serum levels of total cholesterol with the
subgroup of patients with PBC showing total serum
cholesterol >6.21 mmol/l. The controls with hypercholestero￾laemia were excluded from the study if they had liver disease,
alcohol or drug dependence, or substantial coexisting medical
conditions.
We analysed the lipid profile in more detail in two groups
of 30 controls and 45 patients with PBC selected from the
overall study population by a random sampling, balanced
procedure to include the same proportion of people with
hypercholesterolaemia (20 patients in the control group and
30 in the PBC group).
Sample size calculations
In a group of 52 women undergoing statin treatment for
hypercholesterolaemia, who had been assessed by ultrasono￾graphy of the common carotid artery for a different study
carried out at the School of Medicine Ospedale San Paolo,
University of Milan, Milan, Italy, we found a mean (standard
deviation (SD)) IMT value of 0.9 (0.25) mm. Assuming a risk
of type I error of 0.05 (two-sided), we calculated that to
attain a power of 0.9 in detecting in patients with
hypercholesterolaemic PBC a difference equal to at least
20% of the IMT value expected in patients with hypercho￾lesterolaemia and no liver disease (ie, if the IMT values were
0.72 and 0.9 mm in the two groups, respectively, with SD
0.25 mm in both), we would need to allocate 41 subjects to
each group. On the basis of estimates from our previous
study discussing cardiovascular risk in PBC,7 in which the
prevalence of hypercholesterolaemia (total serum cholesterol
>6.21 mmol/l) was 41% in the patients enrolled after
1990, we deemed that screening 100 consecutive outpatients
with PBC was needed to yield about 40 patients with
hypercholesterolaemia.
Measurements
Complete clinical history was obtained and physical exam￾ination was carried out in all subjects. Body mass index
(BMI) was computed from weight and height measurements.
The circumference of the waist was taken at the umbilical
level. Blood pressure was measured three times using a
random-zero sphygmomanometer, and the mean value of the
last two measurements was used for analysis. Blood was
taken from fasting patients with PBC and chronic hepatitis C.
Plasma total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-
cholesterol and triglyceride levels were determined by routine
laboratory methods at the time of enrolment and after
2 months. The mean value of the two measurements
was used in the study analyses and for matching purposes.
Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) values were calculated as
usual by subtracting the sum of the triglyceride values
divided by five and HDL-cholesterol from the total choles￾terol. However, this measure was not used in the overall
evaluations involving patients with PBC, because calculations
are influenced by the presence of high levels of abnormal
lipoproteins in their sera. Instead, we used direct measure￾ments of serum LDL-cholesterol for a detailed analysis of the
lipid profile.
A detailed study of the lipid profile was carried out on
serum samples collected after a 12-h fast. Gas chromato￾graphy–mass spectrometry analysis was used to measure free
and esterified serum cholesterol according to a previously
described method.14 Apolipoprotein (Apo) B and Apo A-1
were assessed by an immunoturbidimetric assay calibrated
against World Health Organization International Reference
Materials (Sentinel CH, Milan, Italy). LDL-cholesterol was
measured by using a direct colorimetric assay (elimination
technique) in homogeneous phase without precipitation
(Sentinel CH).
To measure carotid artery IMT, ultrasonography of the
common carotid artery, carotid bifurcation and internal
carotid artery (left and right arteries) was carried out with
a 7.5-MHz linear-array transducer. The interfaces of the distal
common carotid artery were marked across a length of
10 mm. The beginning of the dilation of the distal common
carotid artery served as a reference point for the start of
measurement. On a longitudinal, two-dimensional ultra￾sound image of the carotid artery, the anterior (near) and
posterior (far) walls of the carotid artery are displayed as two
bright white lines separated by a hypoechogenic space. The
distance between the leading edge of the first bright line of
the far wall (lumen–intima interface) and the leading edge of
the second bright line (media–adventitia interface) indicates
the IMT. Measurements at the far wall are true representa￾tives of the IMT, with a mean agreement between different
readers of 0.02 mm.15 Common carotid artery IMT was the
average of three IMT measurements. For each subject, the
common carotid artery IMT was determined as the average of
far-wall measurements of both the left and right arteries. The
common carotid artery, the carotid bifurcation and the
internal carotid artery were also evaluated for the presence
of atherosclerotic lesions. Plaques were defined as a focal
widening relative to adjacent segments, with protrusion into
the lumen composed either of only calcified deposits or a
combination of calcified and non-calcified material. Carotid
stenosis was quantified by measuring the distance from the
near media–adventitia interface to the far media–adventitia
interface and the distance from the near intimal surface to
the far intimal surface at the most stenotic point of the artery
according to Kagawa et al.16 The degree of stenosis was
defined in terms of the categories based on the North
American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial cri￾teria.17 All of the examinations were carried out by a single
trained doctor blinded to all clinical information. Subjects
were examined in the supine position on a comfortable bed.
The study was approved by the local ethics committee.
Written consent to undergo study investigations was
obtained from each subject after full information on the
study design and purpose.
Data analysis
Continuous variables are summarised as mean (SD) values.
Study data were visually displayed using the box plot
method.18 The significance of differences in means was
assessed using the Mann–Whitney test to compare two
groups, and the Kruskal–Wallis test, a non-parametric
analysis of variance, to compare more than two groups. If

was beyond the significance level (p = 0.05), a set of pairwise
comparisons was carried out using Mann–Whitney tests to
assess which group differed from the others. For each
comparison, the significance value was then multiplied for
the number of comparisons made, according to the
Bonferroni inequality method, to control for multiple testing.
If the main interest of the analysis of variance was to assess
the presence of a gradient in the continuous variable across
ordered groups, a non-parametric test for trend was used.
Differences in proportions were tested using Fisher’s exact
test or x2 statistics.
Carotid artery IMT values in the highest quintile of the
distribution of IMT measures obtained in the subjects
included in the study were defined as increased IMT values
(cut-off value for the quintile with highest thick￾ness = 0.808 mm). To compare the frequency of detection
of increased carotid artery IMT or of carotid stenosis in
different patient groups, ORs, 95% confidence intervals (CIs)
and p values were calculated with logistic regression analysis.
To evaluate relationships with the serum lipid profile within
the framework of multivariable analysis, carotid artery IMT
was also studied as a continuous variable and multiple
regression was used in addition to logistic regression.
All the statistical analyses were two-sided and carried out
using Stata Statistical Software V.8.0.
RESULTS
Table 1 reports the main characteristics of the 103 patients
with PBC. Compared with the 141 subjects in the control
group (101 healthy subjects and 40 patients with chronic
hepatitis C), patients with PBC had higher concentrations of
total cholesterol (mean (SD), 5.87 (1.29) v 5.25 (1.06) mmol/l;
p,0.001), and similar levels of HDL-cholesterol (1.76 (0.49) v
1.66 (0.39) mmol/l; p = 0.290) and triglycerides (1.16.(0.44) v
1.10 (0.53) mmol/l; p = 0.106). As a result of the matching
procedures, age (60 (12) v 59 (11) years) and sex (92% women)
of patients were equally distributed between the two groups.
In the PBC population, 66 patients had serum concentra￾tions of total cholesterol ,6.21 mmol/l (mean (SD) 5.15
(0.83) mmol/l; range 2.43–6.18 mmol/l) and 37 had concen￾trations >6.21 mmol/l (7.19 (0.83) mmol/l; range 6.28–
9.67 mmol/l) (table 1). The 37 patients had significantly
higher serum triglyceride levels and BMI. None of the
patients with PBC from either subset had a history of
excessive alcohol consumption (daily alcohol intake exceed￾ing 80 g in male or 50 g in female patients), and all of them
had stopped alcohol consumption since the time of PBC
diagnosis. The proportion of patients who had never smoked
was similar in patients with PBC, with or without hyper￾cholesterolaemia (61% v 59%). At the time of enrolment, 28
patients (76%) with hypercholesterolaemia and 52 (79%;
p = 0.806) without it were receiving ursodeoxycholic acid for
treatment of liver disease. The mean (SD) duration of
treatment lasting for at least 6 months was 7.2 (4.4) and
6.5 (4.4) years, respectively (p = 0.348).
There was a significant relationship between disease stage
and serum cholesterol levels. Prevalence of liver cirrhosis or
fibrosis was significantly lower in the hypercholesterolaemic
group (table 1), and patients with increasing severity of liver
disease (without liver cirrhosis, n = 58; with uncomplicated
cirrhosis, n = 36; with cirrhosis and major complications of
portal hypertension, n = 9) showed decreasing levels of both
total cholesterol (6.23 (1.03), 5.66 (1.32) and 4.53
(1.50) mmol/l, respectively; p,0.001 for trend) and HDL￾cholesterol (1.84 (0.44) mmol/l, 1.78 (0.52) mmol/l and 1.16
(0.26) mmol/l, respectively; p,0.001 for trend). Severity of
liver disease was not associated with age (58 (12), 62 (12)
and 60 (9) years, respectively; p = 0.430).
On average, the whole population of patients with PBC did
not show increased carotid artery IMT values, which were
actually lower compared with the control group (0.606
(0.136) v 0.653 (0.161) mm; p = 0.027). The proportion of
subjects with increased carotid artery IMT—that is, with an
IMT value in the highest quintile of the distribution of the
measures obtained in the study populations—was 11% in the
patients with PBC and 18% in the controls (p = 0.146).
Carotid artery stenosis was detected in 45% and 55% of the
subjects from the two groups (p = 0.822). Figure 1 shows the

distribution of carotid artery IMT values in patients with
PBC, with or without hypercholesterolaemia, and in subjects
with hyperlipidaemia, without liver disease. Frequency of
increased carotid artery IMT was significantly (pc,0.001)
lower in both PBC groups (14% and 9%, respectively) than in
controls with hyperlipidaemia (54%). Table 2 further analyses
carotid artery measurements in the different study popula￾tions.
Study of the relationship between ultrasonographic find￾ings and the most prevalent cardiovascular risk factors
besides hypercholesterolaemia in the PBC population—that
is, age >61 years and arterial hypertension—showed higher
carotid artery IMT values in elderly patients with PBC than in
their younger counterparts (mean (SD) 0.651 (0.127) v 0.558
(0.129) mm, p,0.001), and no significant difference
between patients with PBC, with or without arterial
hypertension (0.626 (0.131) v 0.597 (0.138) mm;
p = 0.292). Table 3 shows the association between such risk
factors and ultrasonographic findings at the carotid level.
To further characterise the association between cardiovas￾cular risk factors and ultrasound findings at the carotid level
in PBC, we identified the subset of patients with PBC
presenting with arterial hypertension or old age, but did not
have hypercholesterolaemia (n = 38), and the subset pre￾senting with the same risks in addition to hypercholester￾olaemia (n = 22). The 43 patients with PBC who had neither
hypertension nor old age, regardless of their cholesterol
status, were considered the reference group. Mean (SD)
carotid artery IMT values were 0.555 (0.130) mm in the
reference group, and 0.644 (129) and 0.639 (0.130) mm,
respectively, in the two groups presenting hypertension or old
age without hypercholesterolaemia or in addition to it
(pc = 0.005 and pc = 0.029, respectively, v reference group).
Logistic regression analysis showed that, compared with the
reference group, the risk of having a higher value of carotid
artery IMT was 3.1 times greater (95% CI 0.6 to 17; p = 0.192)
in the patients presenting hypertension or old age but no
hypercholesterolaemia, and 4.6 times greater (0.8 to 27;
p = 0.096) in those who also had hypercholesterolaemia. The
corresponding figures relative to the risk of carotid stenosis
were 3.6 (0.4 to 36; p = 0.277) and 15.8 (1.8 to 141;
p = 0.014), respectively.
Detailed lipid profile was studied in two subgroups of 45
patients with PBC and 30 controls that included the same
proportion of subjects with hypercholesterolaemia (30 and 20
patients, respectively). Free:esterified serum cholesterol ratio
was 0.13 (0.06) in the PBC and 0.10 (0.05) in the control
subgroup (p = 0.293). Both HDL-cholesterol and LDL-choles￾terol concentrations were significantly higher in PBC (1.86
(0.44) v 1.45 (0.36) mmol/l, p,0.001; and 4.11 (0.96) v 3.10
(1.37) mmol/l; p = 0.001). Apo A-I was 1.05 (0.70) g/l in the
PBC group and 2.20 (1.09) g/l in the control group
(p,0.001), whereas Apo B did not differ between them
(1.73 (0.76) v 1.67 (0.56) g/l, respectively; p = 0.473).
Multivariable analysis failed to reveal any significant
relationship between lipid profile and higher value of carotid
artery IMT or carotid stenosis. Use of IMT as a continuous
variable gave similar results.
DISCUSSION
This study was designed to clarify the clinical significance of
hypercholesterolaemia in PBC. We used ultrasound imaging
of the carotid artery as a non-invasive indicator of subclinical
atherosclerosis to compare patients with PBC with normo￾cholesterolaemic subjects without any known cardiovascular
risk factors and subjects with hypercholesterolaemia. We
found increased IMT values and high prevalence of carotid
stenosis in controls with hypercholesterolaemia but not in
patients with PBC with corresponding levels of serum
cholesterol. Rather, results of ultrasonographic examination
in the patients who had hypercholesterolaemia with PBC
were remarkably similar to normocholesterolaemic patients
with PBC and controls.
Early atherosclerotic lesions of the carotid artery are
expected to be detectable in PBC well before a distorted
collection of patients remains as a result of patient removal
by liver-related mortality. Therefore, our findings offer strong
support for the contention that hypercholesterolaemia
associated with chronic cholestatic conditions is not athero￾genic, and agree with results of earlier retrospective studies
on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in PBC.6 8 The
available evidence invites consideration of some unknown
factors protecting patients with PBC from the atherogenic
effects of longlasting hypercholesterolaemia. Among these
factors, the particular lipoprotein pattern characteristic of
patients with PBC, with raised HDL-cholesterol levels and the
presence of lipoprotein-X, has been the object of interest and
warrants further investigation.19 20 Complex interactions
between atherogenic lipoproteins and macrophages beyond
cholesteryl ester accumulation and foam cell formation have
been described.21 Although detailed analysis of serum lipid
profiles in a subset of our patients did not show any
relationship with carotid artery IMT or stenosis specific to
PBC, in these patients we found higher HDL-cholesterol and
LDL-cholesterol and lower Apo A-1 levels than in controls.
This picture resembles, at least partly, the altered lipid profile
described by Crippin et al6 in an uncontrolled study on PBC.
Lower Apo A-1 content, despite higher cholesterol content, of
HDL in our patients with PBC compared with controls may be
secondary to initial impairment of protein synthesis. A
thorough lipid analysis, however, was beyond the scope of

this study, and we could not examine the hypothesis that
different types of HDL, less rich in Apo A-1, or altered LDL
contribute to a less atherogenic profile in PBC.
Ursodeoxycholic acid, the only approved medical treatment
for PBC, has been reported to improve hyperlipidaemia in this
condition, probably as the result of general improvement of
cholestatic features.22 However, the magnitude of changes
induced by this bile acid in the lipid pattern of patients with
PBC is negligible compared with cholesterol-lowering
agents.23–25 Moreover, atherosclerosis requires several decades
to develop, a period of time that is much longer than the
average duration of bile acid treatment in the present PBC
series. Finally, it should be noted that in this study each
patient with hypercholesterolaemic PBC was matched with a
control with hypercholesterolaemia according to a set of
criteria that included serum total cholesterol value measured
at the time of enrolment.
Showing that serum cholesterol levels may offer inaccurate
prediction of cardiovascular risk has substantial implications
for the management of patients with PBC. In view of the high
prevalence of hyperlipidaemia in the general population,
many patients with PBC should be expected to present raised
cholesterol levels as the expression of a genetically deter￾mined trait conditioning increased risk of cardiovascular
disease. In recent years, it has become increasingly apparent
that PBC is coming to medical attention more often, showing
a less severe clinical spectrum than in the past.1 2 Although
progression to the latest disease stages is still to be expected
even in presymptomatic patients, survival has improved and
non-liver-related deaths are being recognised as an important
issue.3 Our data show that in the subset of patients with PBC
with hypertension or old age, hypercholesterolaemia may be
associated with increased IMT and frequency of stenosis at
the carotid level. Therefore, this patient subset deserves closer
follow-up, with an active approach for prevention of
cardiovascular disease and therapeutic intervention, includ￾ing the use of inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl
coenzyme A to lower serum cholesterol.4
In conclusion, this study shows that hypercholesterolaemia
associated with PBC does not condition, in itself, the
development of subclinical atherosclerosis as evidenced by
ultrasound imaging of carotid arteries. Cholesterol-lowering
treatment should be undertaken in those patients with
hypercholesterolaemia who also present other risk factors for
cardiovascular disease. Further research on the possible
antiatherogenic properties of lipoprotein patterns specific
for chronic cholestatic conditions, or of other factors that may
result in protection at the endothelial surface, should be
encouraged.

EDITOR’S QUIZ: GI SNAPSHOT ..................................................................
Answer
From question on page 1759.
The excised fleshy mucinous mass (fig 1) was histologically
diagnosed as pseudomyxoma peritonei, which is a rare and
slowly progressive condition. It literally means ‘‘false
mucinous tumour of the peritoneum’’, which is characterised
by secretion of copious amounts of mucoid fluid and tumour
that fill the peritoneal cavity.1 The exact pathogenesis is
unknown, but it is believed to originate from a mucinous
adenoma of the appendix, a mucus-producing gastrointest￾inal adenocarcinoma, or a primary ovarian mucinous
tumour.2
Pseudomyxoma peritonei is diagnosed by combining the
clinical findings of ‘‘jelly belly’’ and the histological features.
Current management of this disease is by cytoreductive
surgery with curative intent. This consists of a peritonectomy
procedure that involves excision of all the affected parietal
and visceral peritonea combined with preoperative intraper￾itoneal chemotherapy (mitomycin C and 5-fluorouracil).3 The
long-term survival of affected people remains poor.4
Although pseudomyxoma peritonei has an indolent course,
complete cure is seldom achieved despite repeated cytoreduc￾tions, and the disease-free intervals between surgical inter￾ventions become progressively shortened. Eventually, surgery
becomes impossible owing to extensive tumour entrapment
of the bowel and patients ultimately die of bowel obstruction
and cachexia.5
