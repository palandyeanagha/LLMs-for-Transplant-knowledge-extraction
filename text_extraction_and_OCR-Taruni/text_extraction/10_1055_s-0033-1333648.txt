Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common
cancer and the third leading cause of cancer-related death
worldwide.1 Unlike most solid cancers, future incidence and
mortality rates for HCC are projected to largely increase in
several regions around the world over the next 20 years,
mostly as a result of the dissemination of hepatitis C virus
infection.2,3 Despite the widespread implementation of sur￾veillance programs of at-risk populations, most patients with
HCC are diagnosed late when curative treatments cannot be
applied.4 In addition, in a high proportion of cases the disease
recurs after attempts at curative therapy.4
Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the
current standard of care for patients with large or multi￾nodular HCC and relatively preserved liver function, absence
of cancer-related symptoms, and no evidence of vascular
invasion or extrahepatic spread (i.e., those classified as

Abstract Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the current standard of care for patients with
intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and relatively preserved liver
function. In a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing conventional
TACE regimens—including the administration of an anticancer-in-oil emulsion followed
by embolic agents—versus best supportive care, TACE was shown to improve median
survival from 16 to 20 months. Various strategies to improve outcomes for this patient
group have become the subject of much ongoing clinical research. The introduction of
an embolic drug-eluting bead (DEB) has been shown to substantially improve the
pharmacokinetic profile of TACE, providing levels of consistency and repeatability not
available with conventional regimens while concomitantly significantly diminishing
systemic drug exposure. In randomized trials, DEB-TACE significantly reduced liver
toxicity and drug-related adverse events compared with conventional TACE. In this
article, technique, indications and contraindications, and clinical outcomes of conven￾tional and DEB-TACE in the management of HCC are reviewed. In addition, scientific
background and early clinical experience with the use of combination regimens
including TACE and systemically active molecular-targeted agents with antiangiogenic
properties are discussed. The combination of DEB-TACE and antiangiogenic therapy
represents a potentially powerful approach that is currently undergoing clinical
investigation in a phase 3 setting.

intermediate stage according to the Barcelona Clinic Liver
Cancer (BCLC) staging system).5–7 Although the administra￾tion of an anticancer-in-oil emulsion followed by embolic
agents has been the most popular TACE technique, the
introduction of an embolic drug-eluting bead (DEB) has
provided an attractive alternative to conventional regimens.8
Clinical studies have shown that DEB loaded with doxorubicin
has a safe pharmacokinetic profile with lower systemic drug
exposure and significantly reduced liver toxicity compared
with conventional TACE.9–11
Despite these advances and technical refinements, the
long-term survival of patients managed with TACE are not
fully satisfactory, mainly as a result of the high rates of tumor
recurrence. TACE exerts therapeutic effects only in the treated
territory; thus other HCC undetected at the time of the
procedure may progress or new tumors may develop. More￾over, by interrupting blood flow to the tumor, TACE induces
necrosis at the site of disease but may create conditions that
permit or even encourage angiogenesis.12 Surrogate markers
of tissue hypoxia that increase after TACE include hypoxia
inducible factor 1 α and both plasma and hepatic vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Thus the combination of
TACE with antiangiogenic agents is appealing because the
systemically active drug might curtail the post-TACE rise in
VEGF-mediated signaling and at the same time target any
tumor foci distant from the site of treatment.12
In this article, technique, indications and contraindica￾tions, and clinical outcomes of conventional and DEB-TACE in
the management of HCC are reviewed. In addition, early
clinical experiences with the combination of TACE and anti￾angiogenic therapies are discussed.
Technique
The rationale for conventional TACE is that the intra-arterial
injection of a viscous emulsion, made by a chemotherapeutic
drug such as doxorubicin or cisplatin mixed with iodized oil,
followed by embolization of the blood vessel with gelatin
sponge particles or other embolic agents, will result in a
strong cytotoxic effect enhanced by ischemia13 (►Fig. 1). An
important limitation of conventional TACE has been the
inconsistency in the technique and the treatment schedules.
This limitation has hampered the acceptance of TACE as a
standard oncologic treatment. DEB-TACE provides levels of
consistency and repeatability not available with conventional
TACE, and it offers the opportunity to implement a more
standardized approach to HCC treatment.14
Pretreatment Imaging
Obtaining triple-phase computed tomography (CT) or mag￾netic resonance imaging (MRI) of the liver is mandatory to
integrate clinical and laboratory data in evaluating the ap￾propriateness of TACE by the local multidisciplinary liver
tumor board. Additional imaging examinations to rule out
extrahepatic disease should be performed as appropriate.
Periprocedural Medication
Pain medication should be given according to standard
hospital protocols. Antibiotic prophylaxis and gastric protec￾tion should be administered at the physician’s discretion.
Choice and Dose of Chemotherapeutic Agent
There is no consensus on the optimal chemotherapeutic
agent(s) to use in conventional TACE. Worldwide, the most
popular anticancer drug for TACE of HCC is doxorubicin. In
conventional TACE, the dose of doxorubicin typically ranges
from 30 to 75/m2
, to a maximum of 150 mg. The drug is
usually mixed with 5 to 20 mL of lipiodol. In DEB-TACE,
different approaches have been recommended for patients
with limited disease (defined as HCC within the Milan criteria
for liver transplantation: single tumor 5 cm, or multiple
tumors (up to three, 3 cm each), or more advanced dis￾ease.14 These distinct populations are as follows:
1. Patients within the Milan criteria: As a general rule, each
single treatment should include a planned dose of 50 to
75 mg doxorubicin loaded into one vial containing 2 mL of
Figure 1 Conventional transcatheter arterial chemoembolization. (A) Following superselective catheterization of the hepatic arterial branch

DC Beads (loading dose, 25 to 37.5 mg doxorubicin/mL of
beads).
2. Patients beyond the Milan criteria: As a general rule, each
single treatment should include a planned dose of up to
150 mg doxorubicin loaded into two vials of DC Beads. In
huge or bilobar tumors, treatment typically includes sep￾arate sessions 4 weeks apart, in the absence of compli￾cations that would require a longer time interval between
the two sessions. Obtaining confirmation that the liver
enzymes have returned to baseline before performing the
second treatment session is recommended.
Choice of Embolic Material and Embolization End Point
In conventional TACE, the administration of the anticancer￾in-oil emulsion is followed by mechanical embolization with
either a spherical or a nonspherical embolic agent. The
embolization end point is usually defined as stasis in the
second- or third-order branches of the lobar hepatic artery. In
DEB-TACE, use of 100- to 300-μm beads is recommended for a
standard procedure. This choice is based on the demonstra￾tion that such small particles are delivered inside the tumor
or in close proximity to the tumor margin, and thus they are
ideal for drug delivery or precise embolization.14 However,
individual patient and tumor characteristics, particularly the
identification of arteriovenous shunting, should be taken into
account when the safety of the treatment and the choice of
bead size are determined. In the case of significant arterio￾portal or hepatic venous shunting, embolization of the shunt
with Gelfoam pledgets or large particles is recommended
before proceeding with DEB administration. Angiographic
confirmation that the shunt is no longer present must be
obtained before DEB injection can be performed, and a larger
bead size may be preferred.
Loaded DC Beads should be mixed with a nonionic contrast
medium. At least 5 to 10 mL of nonionic contrast should be
used per 1 mL of DC Bead (i.e., 10 to 20 mL are required to dilute
one vial of DC Bead) prior to injection. A good suspension of DC
Beads in the contrast should be ensured before delivery. The
injection must be very slow: The authors recommend an
injection rate of 1 mL of the contrast agent/DC Bead suspension
per minute. Care should be taken to avoid sedimentation of the
beads in the syringe by rotating the syringes or using a three￾way stopcock to gently suspend the beads in the solution.14
Injection of DEB should be continued until near stasis is
observed in the artery directly feeding the tumor (i.e., the
contrast column should clear within 2 to 5 heartbeats). At that
point, injection must be stopped regardless of the amount of
beads that have been actually administered, to avoid reflux of
embolic material. Once the embolization end point has been
achieved, no additional embolic material should be injected.
If the “near stasis” end point is not obtained after injection of
the scheduled volume of loaded beads, two different options
are possible. One option is to inject additional unloaded beads
until the embolization end point has been reached. Another
option is not to inject additional unloaded beads and to
schedule the patient for a repeat course of treatment as
needed after imaging follow-up. There are no sufficient
data to mandate one strategy over the other.14
Catheter Positioning
A superselective (i.e., segmental or subsegmental) approach
should be used whenever possible by using a microcatheter
(►Fig. 2). Use of three-dimensional images obtained from C￾arm rotational angiography with a flat-panel detector system
(cone-beam CT) is recommended, if available, to improve the
accuracy in identifying tumor-feeding arteries.15–17 In addi￾tion, repeat cone-beam CT is recommended after delivery to
confirm adequate targeting and saturation of the tumor(s).
Response Assessment
Assessment of tumor response is of utmost importance in
patients undergoing TACE. Unfortunately, conventional
methods for response assessment, such as Response Evalua￾tion Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), have no predictive
value in HCC patients treated with TACE.18 These criteria only
rely on tumor shrinkage as a measure of antitumor activity, an
assumption that is only valid with cytotoxic drugs. TACE
induces direct tumor necrosis, and its anticancer efficacy is
not paralleled by a reduction in overall tumor load but rather
by a reduction in viable tumor, as identified by contrast￾enhanced radiologic imaging. A modification of the RECIST
criteria, named modified RECIST (mRECIST), for HCC is based

on the fact that diameter of the target lesions with viable
tumor should guide all measurements (►Figs. 3 and 4). In
addition, specific modifications of the original criteria re￾garding assessment of vascular invasion, lymph nodes, asci￾tes, pleural effusion, and new lesions have been introduced.19
Tumor response measured by mRECIST after TACE has been
shown to correlate with survival outcomes.20,21 The recent
Clinical Practice Guidelines jointly issued by the European
Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) and the European
Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)
state that assessment of response in HCC should be based on
mRECIST criteria by performing contrast-enhanced CT or MRI
4 weeks after initial treatment.7
Treatment Schedule
No randomized trials have been designed to evaluate the
optimal frequency of therapy. TACE has been performed both
at regular predefined time intervals and “on demand,” ac￾cording to tumor response as observed on imaging. When an
“on-demand” strategy is followed, further TACE treatment is
usually scheduled in patients with residual viable tumor—
including partial response, stable disease, and progressive
disease according to mRECIST—8 weeks after the initial
treatment, in the absence of contraindications requiring a
longer time interval. Obtaining confirmation that the liver
enzymes have returned to baseline before repeating treat￾ment is recommended. In contrast, in patients with no
evidence of residual viable disease (i.e., with complete re￾sponse according to mRECIST), imaging follow-up should be
scheduled every 2 to 3 months.
TACE Discontinuation
TACE should be discontinued, even if technically feasible, in
patients presenting with untreatable progression.14 Untreat￾able progression is defined by at least one of the following:
1. Failure to achieve an objective response in the targeted
tumor after at least two treatments. Of importance, the
emergence of new intrahepatic tumor foci remote from
the treated territory, although clearly representing tumor
progression according to mRECIST for HCC, does not
contraindicate further treatment with TACE.
2. Clinical or functional deterioration. Treatment should be
discontinued in patients showing clinical progression to

regimens have been initiated.
Indications and Contraindications
The best candidates for TACE are patients with asymptomatic
multinodular tumors without vascular invasion or extrahe￾patic spread.7 TACE is also offered to patients with early-stage
HCC when surgical options or percutaneous ablation are
precluded, following the concept of treatment stage migra￾tion described in the EASL-EORTC Clinical Practice Guidelines
(►Fig. 5).7 Liver functional reserve is a critical component for
careful patient selection. Patients should present with rela￾tively well-preserved liver function (mostly Child-Pugh A or
B7 without ascites); those with liver decompensation or more
advanced liver failure should be excluded because the ische￾mic insult can lead to severe adverse events. ►Table 1

Clinical Outcomes
Conventional TACE
The survival benefit of conventional TACE has been the
subject of a limited number of randomized controlled trials
that provided contradictory results.13 A cumulative meta￾analysis of the studies, however, has clearly shown that 2-year
survival of patients with HCC not suitable for radical therapies
who are treated with arterial embolization or chemoembo￾lization is improved compared with conservative manage￾ment.23 Sensitivity analysis in this study showed a significant
benefit of chemoembolization with cisplatin or doxorubicin
assessing by 323 patients in four studies but no benefit with
embolization alone by assessing 215 patients in three
studies.23
In a recent Cochrane meta-analysis, the evidence support￾ing the benefits of TACE was questioned.24 The authors of the
Cochrane review state that, contrary to current clinical prac￾tice, there is absence of evidence of TACE having a beneficial
effect on survival in participants with unresectable HCC.24
However, several experts have questioned such conclusions
and expressed concern over this Cochrane review.25,26 It has
been pointed out that the analysis included an randomized
controlled trial (RCT) undertaken in patients with early HCC—
in whom transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) (not TACE)
was assessed in combination with local ablation—and that, on
the other hand, it excluded two major trials that found

improved survival because of the risk of bias according to
Cochrane criteria.25,26
The outcome of TACE appears to depend on careful patient
selection. In a RCT that recruited patients with compensated
cirrhosis (70% in Child-Pugh A), absence of cancer-related
symptoms (81% with ECOG performance status of 0), and
large or multinodular HCC with neither vascular invasion nor
extrahepatic spread, 2-year survival after conventional TACE
reached 63%, compared with 27% of the untreated control arm
(p ¼ 0.009).27 In contrast, in another RCT, the use of broader
enrollment criteria with inclusion of patients with symptoms
or limited portal vein invasion resulted in a 2-year survival of
only 31%.28 This figure was still superior to the one of the
untreated control group (2-year survival, 11%; p ¼ 0.002). In
this study, no survival benefit was identified in the subgroup
analysis restricted to patients presenting with portal vein
invasion.28
DEB-TACE
The clinical value of DEB-TACE has been demonstrated by
RCTs. In a multicenter phase 2 randomized trial including 201
European patients (PRECISION V), the use of doxorubicin￾eluting beads resulted in a marked reduction in liver toxicity
and drug-related adverse events compared with conventional
TACE with doxorubicin.10,11 The mean maximum aspartate
aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase increase in
the DC Bead group were 50% and 41% less than in the
conventional TACE group (p < 0.001). Owing to the improved
safety and tolerability profile, high-dose doxorubicin treat￾ment could be applied according to the planned schedule in
the whole drug-eluting bead group, resulting in consistently
high rates of objective response and disease control in all
subgroup analyses. Contrary to the observation in the DEB
arm, the objective response rate (ORR) and the disease control
rate (DCR) for conventional TACE in the subgroups of patients
with more advanced disease were significantly reduced
(p ¼ 0.038 for ORR; p ¼ 0.026 for DCR), although the differ￾ences were not statistically significant in the overall patient
population (ORR: 52% versus 44%; DCR: 63% versus 52%). A
recent case-control study conducted in Asian patients with
HCC confirmed higher ORR for DEB-TACE as compared with
conventional TACE.29
The added value of chemotherapeutic agent over bland
embolic microspheres has been demonstrated by a random￾ized trial comparing beads loaded with doxorubicin versus
bland embolization performed with an embolic microsphere
with similar characteristics. The rate of tumor progression at
12 months was significantly lower in the DEB arm than in the
bland embolization arm (46% versus 78%, p ¼ 0.002), and
time to progression (TTP) increased from 36.2  9.0 weeks to
42.4  9.5 weeks (p ¼ 0.008).30 Another investigation as￾sessed the degree of necrosis in explanted livers after

chemoembolization with epirubicin-loaded DEB versus bland
embolization in patients on a transplant waiting list: DEB￾TACE achieved complete necrosis in 77% of lesions, whereas
bland embolization achieved complete necrosis in only 27% of
lesions (p ¼ 0.043).31
Despite the absence of phase 3 trials comparing DEB-TACE
versus conventional regimens, DEB-TACE has been increas￾ingly used as the first-line transcatheter treatment for HCC.
DEB-TACE provides levels of consistency and repeatability not
available with conventional TACE, and it offers the opportu￾nity to implement a standardized approach to HCC treatment.
A recent publication reported a median survival of 48 months
in a cohort of 104 HCC Western patients treated with DEB￾TACE, a figure that appears to be far superior with respect to
those reported for conventional TACE.32
Synergies and Combination Strategies
An important limitation of all TACE regimens is the high rate
of tumor recurrence. In RCTs, a sustained response lasting >3
to 6 months was observed in only 28 to 35% of patients who
received conventional TACE, and in nonresponders no sur￾vival benefit was identified compared with best supportive
care.27,28 Even in those patients in whom initial response was
achieved, the 3-year cumulative rate of intrahepatic recur￾rence reaches 65%, with recurrent tumor showing significant￾ly shorter median doubling time.33 As a result, the 3-year
survival rate of TACE-treated patients did not exceed 26 to
29% in RCTs.27,28
Increased understanding of the molecular signaling path￾ways involved in HCC has led to the development of molecular￾targeted therapies aimed at inhibiting tumor cell proliferation
and angiogenesis. Sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor with
antiangiogenic and antiproliferative properties, has been
shown to prolong median overall survival and median time
to radiologic progression compared with placebo in RCTs, and it
has become the current standard of care for patients with
advanced-stage tumors not suitable for surgical or locoregional
therapies.34,35
Tumor recurrence following TACE is characterized by
increased VEGF production and subsequent angiogenesis.
Moreover, TACE increases VEGF expression in the residual
surviving cancerous tissue36 and induces expression of other
proangiogenic factors, such as hypoxia inducible factor 1 α.
37
Based on these findings, a combination of TACE with agents
with antiangiogenic properties would appear to be a rational
approach.
The availability of DEB that minimizes the systemic che￾motherapy exposure at the time of TACE is appealing for
combination regimens, based on mechanisms that are theo￾retically synergistic. DEB-TACE has been shown to be safe and
effective, with significantly reduced systemic drug exposure
compared with conventional TACE regimens. Sorafenib has
demonstrated efficacy and safety in patients with advanced
HCC, with activity on both tumor cells and endothelial cells. In
a prospective single-center phase 2 study, safety and re￾sponse of a combined protocol involving sorafenib 400 mg
twice per day and DEB-TACE were assessed in 35 patients.38
Although most patients experienced at least one grade 3 to 4
toxicity, most toxicities were minor (grade 1 to 2, 83% versus
grade 3 to 4, 17%), and preliminary efficacy data were
promising.
The phase 2 randomized double-blind placebo-controlled
SPACE study (Sorafenib or Placebo in Combination with DEB￾TACE for Intermediate-Stage HCC) was the first global trial on
the use of TACE in the treatment of HCC.39 The objective of the
study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sorafenib in
combination with DEB-TACE in patients with intermediate￾stage HCC. The study was conducted at 85 sites across Europe,
North America, and the Asia-Pacific region. Patients were
eligible if they had asymptomatic unresectable multinodular
tumors without vascular invasion or extrahepatic spread,
Child-Pugh A liver functional status, and ECOG performance
status 0.39 Patients were randomized to receive sorafenib
400 mg twice daily or matching placebo continuously until
progression. All patients received DEB-TACE (150 mg doxo￾rubicin) 3 to 7 days after the first dose of the study drug, and
then on day 1 (  4 days) of cycles 3, 7, and 13, and every six
cycles thereafter. Patients were allowed optional DEB-TACE
sessions between cycles 7 and 13 and cycles 13 and 19, if
deemed necessary by the investigator.
Of 452 patients screened, 307 were randomized to sor￾afenib (n ¼ 154) or placebo (n ¼ 153). The study met its
primary end point of improving TTP; the TTP for DEB-TACE
plus sorafenib was longer than the one for DEB-TACE plus
placebo. The hazard ratio for TTP was 0.797 (95% confidence
interval, 0.588 to 1.080; p ¼ 0.072; one-sided α: 0.15). The
combination was well tolerated, and no new safety findings
that would preclude use of the combination were observed.
Nevertheless, the encouraging efficacy signal requires confir￾mation with data from ongoing phase 3 trials. In fact, several
questions remain as investigators attempt to improve treat￾ment outcomes in HCC patients. The pathophysiologic com￾plexity of HCC, balanced with a goal of providing effective
tumor therapy with preservation of organ function, makes
optimal treatment choice a clinical challenge. An understand￾ing of exactly which features of HCC and patient health may
predict the clinical outcome of combination regimens is
essential for prescribing individualized evidence-based ther￾apeutic strategies.40
