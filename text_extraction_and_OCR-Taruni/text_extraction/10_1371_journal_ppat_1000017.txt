Abstract
Interferons (IFN) exert antiviral, immunomodulatory and cytostatic activities. IFN-a/b (type I IFN) and IFN-l (type III IFN) bind
distinct receptors, but regulate similar sets of genes and exhibit strikingly similar biological activities. We analyzed to what
extent the IFN-a/b and IFN-l systems overlap in vivo in terms of expression and response. We observed a certain degree of
tissue specificity in the production of IFN-l. In the brain, IFN-a/b was readily produced after infection with various RNA
viruses, whereas expression of IFN-l was low in this organ. In the liver, virus infection induced the expression of both IFN-a/
b and IFN-l genes. Plasmid electrotransfer-mediated in vivo expression of individual IFN genes allowed the tissue and cell
specificities of the responses to systemic IFN-a/b and IFN-l to be compared. The response to IFN-l correlated with
expression of the a subunit of the IFN-l receptor (IL-28Ra). The IFN-l response was prominent in the stomach, intestine and
lungs, but very low in the central nervous system and spleen. At the cellular level, the response to IFN-l in kidney and brain
was restricted to epithelial cells. In contrast, the response to IFN-a/b was observed in various cell types in these organs, and
was most prominent in endothelial cells. Thus, the IFN-l system probably evolved to specifically protect epithelia. IFN-l
might contribute to the prevention of viral invasion through skin and mucosal surfaces.

Introduction
Type I interferon (IFN), also called IFN-a/b, was originally
discovered owing to its potent antiviral activity [1]. Type I IFN
was later shown to display pleiotropic activities. It modulates
innate and acquired immune responses, cell growth and apoptosis
[2].
Type I IFN forms a vast multigenic family [3]. Human and
mouse genomes carry 13 or 14 genes coding for closely related
IFN-a subtypes [4,5]. In addition, they contain genes coding for
IFN-b, IFN-k [6], IFN-e/t [7] and IFN-v (human) or limitin/
IFN-f (mouse) [8]. MuIFN-a subtypes share about 90% amino
acid sequence identity with each other and approximately 30%
sequence identity with other type I IFN subtypes. Some of these
IFNs are glycosylated while others are not [4,5,9,10]. In spite of
this remarkable variability, all type I IFN subtypes appear to bind
the same heterodimeric receptor [11], raising the question of the
reason for type I IFN gene multiplicity. Some data suggest that
various IFN subtypes might exhibit different affinities for each of
the receptor subunits and hence, generate signals that could vary
in nature, duration, or intensity. For instance, Jaitin and his
collaborators reported that IFN-a/b subtypes differ in their affinity
for IFNAR1 and that this receptor subunit is the limiting factor for
ternary complex formation [12]. Binding to the IFNAR1 subunit
would favor signaling pathways leading to antiproliferative activity
whereas binding to the IFNAR2 subunit would favor signaling
pathways leading to antiviral responses [13]. Such subtle binding
differences could explain the few qualitative differences observed
in the activity of different IFN subtypes. Alternatively, the
multigenic nature of the IFN family could allow individual IFN
subtypes to be expressed in a tissue or in a cell-specific fashion.
Intriguingly, the multigenic type I IFN system cohabits with the
seemingly redundant type III IFN system discovered more
recently. Type III IFN (also called IFN-l or IL-28/29) is
structurally and genetically close to the members of the IL-10
family of cytokines but displays type I IFN-like activity [14,15]. In
humans, 3 genes code for the 3 members of this new family: IFN￾l1, IFN-l2 and IFN-l3. Among these molecules, only HuIFN-l1
is glycosylated [14,15]. In the mouse, the IFN-l1 gene is a
pseudogene. IFN-l2 and IFN-l3 genes encode glycosylated
proteins [16].
IFN-l expression has been shown to depend on the same
triggers (viral infection, TLR ligands) [17,18] and signal
transduction pathways [19–21] as those inducing type I IFN
expression. Type I and type III IFNs bind unrelated heterodimeric
receptors. The type I IFN receptor is made of the ubiquitously
expressed IFNAR1 and IFNAR2c subunits [22]. The type III IFN
receptor is made of the IL-10Rb subunit which is widely expressed
and shared by other IL-10 related cytokines, and of the IL-28Ra
subunit which is specific to IFN-l and responsible for signal
transduction [14–16,23]. Although type I and type III IFN
receptors are unrelated, they trigger strikingly similar responses,

mostly through the activation of STAT-1 and STAT-2, and, to a
lesser extent, of STAT-3 [14,16,24–26]. Association of phosphor￾ylated STAT-1 and -2 with IRF-9/p48 yields the ISGF3 complex
which induces the transcription of hundreds of genes, the so-called
‘‘interferon stimulated genes’’ (ISGs). These ISGs encode proteins
such as Mx1, OAS or IFIT, which mediate the antiviral effects of
IFN [27]. IFN-a/b and IFN-l were also reported to activate the
MAP kinase pathway through JNK and p38 phosphorylation.
ISGs activated by type I and type III IFNs were found to be
similar [25,26]. Accordingly, type III IFN was shown to display
antiviral [23,24,28,29], antiproliferative [16,30], and immuno￾modulatory properties [31,32], similar to those of type I IFN.
It has been shown that, in vitro, cell responses to IFN-l closely
depend on the expression of the IL-28Ra receptor subunit [18,26].
Overexpression of IL-28Ra in non-responding cells restored the
response of these cells to IFN-l [26]. IL-28Ra expression has been
detected in primary keratinocytes and colonic cells, but not in
splenocytes, fibroblasts and endothelial cells, indicating that the
IFN-l receptor can be expressed in a cell-specific fashion [16,24].
These data suggest that, in vivo, distinct cells or tissues might be
targeted by IFN-a/b and IFN-l. However, few data are available
about production of IFN-l and about the tissue and cell specificity
of the response to this IFN in vivo.
To examine possible tissue specificity of IFN-l expression, we
compared the expression of type I and type III IFNs in the brain
and in the liver, using various viral infection models. To compare
the responsiveness of different tissues and cells to type I and type
III IFNs, we used a strategy based on in vivo expression of cloned
IFN genes. We observed some tissue specificity in the production
of type III IFN and a clear tissue specificity in the response to type
III IFN. At the cellular level, the response to IFN-l showed a
marked specificity for epithelial cells, thus clearly differing from
the response to IFN-a.
Results
Tissue dependency of type III IFN gene expression
Currently available in vitro data do not reveal differential
expression of type I and type III IFN genes. To test whether some
tissue specificity exists in the production of type III versus type I
IFN in vivo, we compared IFN-a, IFN-b and IFN-l expression in
the brain and in the liver of mice infected with various RNA
viruses: Theiler’s virus (TMEV, the neurovirulent strain GDVII or
the persistent strain DA1), LACVdelNSs (La Crosse virus mutant
lacking the IFN-antagonist protein NSs), Mouse Hepatitis virus
(MHV, strain A59) or Lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus
(LDV).
For detection of mouse IFN-l, we designed new primers that
amplify both IFN-l2 and IFN-l3 transcripts, but not putative
transcripts from the IFN-l1 pseudogene. For detection of mouse
IFN-a, we designed primers that are specific for IFN-a5 (Table 1).
This IFN subtype has been shown to be among the most
prominently induced IFN-a subtypes in the brain, after both
LACV and TMEV infections [33]. Using the RT-PCR-cloning￾sequencing strategy used in the former study [33], we observed
that IFN-a5 was also among the most prominently expressed IFN￾a subtypes (20.4%) in the liver of MHV-infected mice (Figure 1).
Thus, IFN-a5 expression appears to be a good marker to follow
global IFN-a expression in both infected livers and brains.
We first analyzed IFN production in mice infected intracere￾brally (i.c.) with MHV-A59 or intraperitoneally (i.p.) with LDV
(Table 2). Following i.c. injection, MHV-A59 can spread within
the central nervous system (CNS), by the hematogenous and
neuronal routes. The virus can also enter the bloodstream via the
disrupted blood-brain-barrier at the inoculation site and reach the
liver where it replicates. MHV-A59 strain is known to target a
large range of cells including hepatocytes, macrophages (including
Kupffer cells and microglial cells), endothelial cells, glial cells and
neurons [34]. LDV injected i.p. rapidly infects a population of
LDV-permissive macrophages in the mouse [35]. One day post￾infection, which corresponds to the peak of viremia, LDV antigen￾positive cells have been detected in most organs, including the liver
and the leptomeninges of the brain. Subsequently, the virus
establishes a persistent infection that is limited by the number of
available target cells [36,37]. Thus, groups of C57BL/6 mice were
infected either i.c. with MHV-A59 or i.p. with LDV, since these
infection models allow to compare the IFN responses in the brain
and the liver of the same animals. Mice infected with MHV-A59
were sacrificed at 72h post infection, when clinical signs of
encephalitis were prominent. LDV-infected mice were sacrificed at
24 hours post infection, which corresponds to the peak of viremia
and of IFN expression [36,38].

MHV-A59 infected livers. IFN-a coding sequences were amplified by
RT-PCR using a primer mixture designed to amplify equally the different
murine IFN-a subtypes [33]. PCR products were then cloned and
individual clones were sequenced. The histogram shows the percent￾age of sequences from 2 mice (50 and 53 sequences) corresponding to
each IFN-a subtype.

Author Summary
Virus-infected cells can secrete interferons (IFNs), cytokines
that induce an infection-resistant state in neighboring
cells. IFNs are critical to slow down early multiplication of
pathogens in the body. Two IFN families exhibiting
strikingly similar properties were described: type I IFNs
(or IFN-a/b) and type III IFNs (or IFN-l). Our work addressed
the question of the redundancy of these two IFN systems
in vivo. First, we found that the relative expression of IFN-l
over that of IFN-a/b exhibited some extent of tissue
specificity and was low in the brain. Next, we used a
strategy based on in vivo expression of cloned IFN genes
to compare the responses of different tissues to IFN-a and
IFN-l. As was suggested by previous in vitro work,
response to IFN-l appeared to be restricted to epithelial
cells, unlike response to IFN-a which occurred in most cell
types. Tissues with a high epithelial content such as
intestine, skin or lungs were the most responsive to IFN-l
and expressed the higher amounts of IFN-l receptor. Our
data suggest that the IFN-l system evolved as a specific
protection of epithelia and that it might contribute to
prevent viral invasion through skin and mucosal surfaces.
Type I and Type III IFNs In Vivo

In mice infected with LDV (Figure 2A), we noticed a striking
difference in the relative expression of IFN-l in the brain and in
the liver. IFN-l mRNA was readily detected in the liver but was
hardly detectable in the brain (1 out of 9 mice had detectable
amounts of IFN-l mRNA in the brain). In contrast, IFN-a and
IFN-b mRNAs were clearly detected in both the liver and the
brain of these mice. The expression of IFN-l, relative to that of
type I IFN was significantly lower in the brain than in the liver
(Table 3). In mice infected with MHV-A59 (Figure 2B), the same
trend was observed. The differences were less extensive, yet
statistically significant (Table 3).
We then examined, in diverse experimental infection conditions
(see Table 2), whether the same trend of lower relative expression
of IFN-l in the brain than in the liver existed. IFN production was
examined in the brain of mice infected with neurotropic viruses
(TMEV-DA1, TMEV-GDVII, LACVdelNSs). At the time point
analyzed (Table 2), both TMEV strains inoculated intracerebrally
primarily infect neurons, as do LACVdelNSs inoculated intraper￾itoneally [39–41]. In the brain of mice infected with these viruses,
IFN-l expression was either non-detectable (TMEV-DA1) or very
low, compared to that of IFN-a or IFN-b (TMEV-GDVII and
LACVdelNSs) (Figure 2C, 2D, 2E, 2F). In contrast, in the liver of

Type I and Type III IFNs In Vivo

mice infected i.p. with MHV-A59, although variation existed
between experimental groups, IFN-l expression was close to or
higher than that of IFN-a (Figure 2G, 2H). Taken together, our
data suggest that IFN-l expression (relative to that of IFN-a/b) is
restricted in the brain as compared to the liver.
In vivo expression of IFN genes by electrotransfer
We next analyzed whether the response to specific IFNs also
exhibited some degree of tissue specificity in vivo. To this end, we
chose to compare ISGs expression in peripheral organs and in the
CNS, after in vivo expression of cloned IFN genes. IFN was
expressed in vivo from expression vectors that were electroinjected
in the tibialis anterior muscle [42]. An advantage of this technique
over the administration of recombinant IFN is that gene products
are expected to carry native post-translational modifications like
glycosylation.
We tested the efficacy of the procedure by following plasmid￾driven expression of luciferase, using in vivo imaging. As shown in
Figure 3, luciferase expression was readily detectable in the tibialis
muscle after 2 days, and lasted up to 3 or 4 months after a single

plasmid electroinjection. Then, to test whether IFN could be
expressed in vivo, in this experimental setting, mice were
electroinjected in the tibialis anterior muscle, with plasmid DNA
coding for MuIFN-a6T (accession AY220465) or for a mutant of
this IFN carrying a glycosylation site (D68N mutation). PCR
analysis and sequencing of PCR products confirmed that the IFN
subtype expressed in the muscle corresponded to the subtype
expressed by the injected plasmid (data not shown). Two days and
seven days after electroinjection, both glycosylated and non￾glycosylated forms of circulating IFN-a6T, expressed from tibialis
muscles, induced the expression of various ISGs (OASl2, Mx1,
IRF7 and Ifit1) in the injected muscle but also in liver, spleen and
kidney. ISGs were also upregulated, but to a lesser level, in the
brain and in the spinal cord (Figures 4 and 5, Tables 4 and 5, and
data not shown). When the empty vector was electroinjected,
upregulation of ISG expression was detectable in the injected
muscle but hardly, if at all, in other tissues. Experiments conducted
in IFNAR1-KO mice failed to reveal transcriptional upregulation
of ISGs by IFN-a6T (Figure 5, Tables 4 and 5), showing that the
induction of ISGs, observed in mice carrying the type I IFN
receptor gene, was indeed type-I IFN-dependent.
Thus, electrotransfer of plasmid DNA in vivo allows the
expression of circulating IFN which activates ISG expression in
the tissues examined. In this experimental setting, no significant
difference was detected between the activities of glycosylated and
non-glycosylated forms of IFN-a6T.
Response to systemic type III IFN
We used this in vivo expression strategy to compare the tissue
specificities of the responses to type I and type III IFNs. Seven
days after electrotransfer, we measured, by real-time RT-PCR,
ISG expression in the organs of mice that received plasmids coding
for either IFN-a6T or IFN-l3 (Figures 4 and 5 and Tables 4 and
5). Interestingly, although IFN-a6T induced bona fide ISG
expression in all organs tested, response to IFN-l3 exhibited
some tissue specificity. In response to IFN-l3, expression of OASl2
(Figure 4), Mx1 (Figure 5), and IFIT1 (not shown) was close to
background in the brain, spinal cord, spleen, liver, and muscle but
was detected in the kidney. In different experimental settings
(Table 4), induction of OASl2 expression by IFN-l3 was
#3.160.7 in the brain but ranged from 660.9 to 2765.2 in the
kidney. Accordingly, induction of Mx1 expression in mice carrying
functional Mx1 alleles was #2.360.4 in the brain but ranged from
8.462.4 to 2960.6 in the kidney. Experiments performed in
IFNAR1-KO mice (Figure 5 and Table 5) indicated that the
induction of ISG expression observed with IFN-l3 did not depend
on the activation of the type I IFN system.
Tissue specificity of IL-28Ra expression
In cell lines, the response to type III IFN was shown to be
related to the expression level of the a subunit of the IL-28
receptor. Differential expression of IL-28Ra could thus explain the
tissue selectivity of IFN-l responses in vivo. We used real-time RT￾PCR to compare the expression levels of IL-28Ra and of the
ubiquitously expressed IFNAR1 subunit of the type I IFN
receptor, in the brain, liver and kidney. Expression of IFNAR1
and IL-28Ra were influenced neither by IFN-a nor by IFN-l
expression (Figure 6). In the kidney, which showed good
responsiveness to type III IFN, IL-28Ra expression was clearly
higher than in brain and liver (Figure 6).
IFN-l induces ISG expression in epithelial cells but not in
endothelial cells
In order to identify the cells responding to type I and type III
IFNs in vivo, we performed immunohistofluorescence using Mx1
as a marker of the IFN response. On one hand, we studied the IFN
response in the kidney which was found to respond readily to both
IFN-a and IFN-l (see Figure 4). On the other hand, we examined
the IFN response in the brain. In contrast to the kidney, this organ
readily responded to type I IFN but hardly responded to type III
IFN.
In the kidney, IFN-a-induced Mx1 expression was widespread
(Figures 7C, 7E, 7G, and 8A). Mx1 labeling was prominent in
endothelial cells (Figures 7C, 7E, 7G) but Mx1-positive cells also

included epithelial cells of the tubules and of the urinary
epithelium (not shown). The neighboring adipose tissue was also
strongly responsive to IFN-a6T (Figure 8A). In contrast, Mx1
expression in response to IFN-l was strikingly restricted to
epithelial cells (Figures 7D, 7F). Labeling of the urinary epithelium
was prominent (Figure 7H) (much stronger than in response to
IFN-a expression). Glomeruli were negative (Figure 7D). In the
cortex and medulla, only epithelial cells were positive. Adipose
tissue showed background-like labeling (Figure 8B).
In the brain, very few cells responded to IFN-l, as expected
from the very low expression of ISGs in this organ. These cells
appeared to correspond to rare epithelial cells of the meninges and
to cells of the choroid plexus. In the choroid plexus, the
comparison between Mx1 expression in response to IFN-a and
to IFN-l was exemplar (Figure 8C–F). IFN-a induced mostly Mx1
expression in the endothelial cells of the vessels comprised between
the two monolayers of cuboidal epithelial cells (Figure 8C and 8E).
Some epithelial cells were also Mx1-positive. In response to IFN-l,
Mx1 expression was prominent in epithelial cells but absent from
endothelial cells (Figure 8D and 8F).
In view of the striking restriction of the IFN-l response to
epithelial cells in the brain and in the kidney, we tested whether
the responsiveness of different tissues to IFN-l would parallel their
epithelial nature. Thus, we used real-time RT-PCR to compare, in
different tissues, i) ISG induction in response to systemically
expressed IFN-l versus IFN-a (Figure 9A), and ii) IL-28Ra versus
IFNAR1 expression (Figure 9B). Response of the tissues to IFN-l
(over IFN-a) nicely paralleled IL-28Ra (over IFNAR1) expression.
Interestingly, tissues like stomach, intestine, skin, and lung, which
have an important epithelium component showed the highest
IFN-l over IFN-a responsiveness. The small apparent differences
seen between relative expressions of IL-28Ra (over that of
IFNAR1) in tissues of gastro-intestinal tract and in lungs or skin
were not significant. Also, these differences did not appear when
considering IL-28Ra expression alone (data not shown). In
contrast, nervous tissues and spleen responded very poorly to

IFN-l and expressed small amounts of IL-28Ra. Surprisingly, the
liver responded poorly to IFN-l and expressed low amounts of IL￾28Ra, in spite of the epithelial nature of the hepatocytes. In
contrast, the response of the heart was surprisingly high.
Discussion
Tissue specificity of IFN-l expression
Many data converge to show that type I IFN can be expressed
by virtually all nucleated cells, including some neurons. In
contrast, little is known about the specificity of IFN-l expression.
Upregulation of IFN-l transcription has been shown to depend on
the same stimuli, sensors, and signal transduction pathways as
those involved in type I IFN production [17–21,28]. IFN-l
expression has been mainly described in vitro, in MD-DCs, pDCs,
macrophages, and in numerous lymphoid, myeloid and epithelial
cancer cell lines [18,28]. In these studies, IFN-a/b and IFN-l have
been shown to be expressed simultaneously. In MD-DCs and in
pDCs, upon influenza A or Sendai virus infection, IFN-a/b and
IFN-l were expressed at the same order of magnitude and with
similar kinetics [43].
Our data show that expression of IFN-l in the central nervous
system is minimal, even under conditions of strong IFN-a and
IFN-b expression, as those observed after infection by LACV￾delNSs or TMEV-GDVII. In contrast, in the liver, IFN-l was
readily expressed after both LDV and MHV-A59 infections. The

Type I and Type III IFNs In Vivo

difference between relative type III and type I IFN expression
levels detected in the liver and in the brain was highly significant in
the case of C57BL/6 mice infected i.p. with LDV or infected i.c.
with MHV-A59. A similar trend of low relative expression of IFN￾l in the brain was observed with the other infection models
(different viruses and different mouse strains). However, our study
does not exclude a possible influence of the mouse genetic
background in the relative expression of type I and type III IFN
genes.
Nevertheless, our results show that some differential tissue
specificity exists in the production of type I and type III IFNs. This
suggests that the molecular pathways leading to type I and type III
IFN gene expression vary either qualitatively (some specific factors
required for IFN-l gene induction) or quantitatively (different
thresholds of sensors, signal transduction or transcription factors
required for the activation of type I and type III IFNs). The tissue
specificity of IFN-l production observed in this work probably
results from cell type specificity. In vitro, IFN-l was shown to be
notably produced by MD-DCs and pDCs [43]. If these cells are
also important IFN-l producers in vivo, the paucity of DCs, in
particular of pDCs, in the CNS might be the reason for the low
expression of type III IFN in this organ.
Tissue and cell specificity of the IFN-l response
In cell lines, IFN-l responses have been shown to correlate with
expression of IL-28Ra. On the basis of IL-28Ra expression and of
IFN-l responsiveness of cell lines and primary cells, it was
suggested that IFN-l could be primarily expressed by cells of
epithelial origin. Accordingly, in vivo, IFN-l proved to be effective
against some viruses known to infect epithelial cells such as Herpes
simplex virus-2 [17]. Indirect evidence also comes from the fact
that Yaba-like disease virus, a virus with tropism for the dermis
was found to produce a type III IFN antagonist protein [11].
However, until now, no direct in vivo data identified the cells
responding to IFN-l.
Here, we show, by immunohistochemistry, that the response to
IFN-l involves primarily epithelial cells, at least in the kidney and

in the CNS. In the kidney, Mx1 expression in response to IFN-l
was notably prominent in cells of the pluristratifiated urinary
epithelium. In contrast, endothelial cells which responded nicely to
IFN-a failed to respond to IFN-l. In the choroid plexus of the
brain, response to IFN-a was most prominent in endothelial cells
and detectable in cuboidal epithelial cells. In contrast, response to
IFN-l was only detectable in cuboidal epithelial cells. At the tissue
level, responsiveness to IFN-l, as measured by ISG induction,
correlated with IL-28Ra over IFNAR1 expression. Again,
epithelium-rich tissues such as stomach, intestine, skin or lung
were responsive to IFN-l. It is not clear, however, why the liver
was not more responsive and why the heart appeared to be as
responsive as the lung.
IFN-l was reported to share, with type I IFN, immunomod￾ulatory activities. For instance, IFN-l was found to modulate the
Th1/Th2 balance of the immune responses [32]. However, in
agreement with previous studies, our data show that neither
endothelial cells nor spleen cells, two important components of
homing and activation of immune cells, responded detectably to
IFN-l, though the response of a small cell population could easily
have been undetected. It will be of interest to identify the target
cells that mediate the immunomodulatory function of IFN-l.
Lack of IFN-l response in the central nervous system
Type I IFN turned out to have much impact on CNS
pathologies. On one hand, type I IFN was shown to be
instrumental in the resistance of humans and mice to neurotropic
viral infections [44,45]. On the other hand, type I IFN proved to
be beneficial against autoimmune disorders like multiple sclerosis
[46,47] and the murine experimental autoimmune encephalitis
[48]. IFN-b was shown to decrease the relapse rate and disease
activity in relapsing-remitting MS [49]. However, exposure to type
I IFN can also cause adverse effects. IFN treatment often triggers
flu-like symptoms. When prolonged, for instance in the case of
hepatitis C treatment, type I IFN treatment can lead to
neurological or neuropsychiatric adverse effects like depression
[50,51].
IFN-l could represent an interesting alternative to type I IFN.
Indeed, IFN-l appears to activate the same set of genes as type I
IFN and most biological functions of type I IFN appear to be
shared by type III IFN. We observed that the CNS is both a poor
IFN-l producer and a poor responder to this cytokine. In the
CNS, the blood-brain barrier is mostly made of the tight junctions
that bridge the endothelial cells and thus prevent the diffusion of
metabolites from the blood to the CNS parenchyma. The lack of
responsiveness of endothelial cells to circulating IFN-l could thus
explain the global absence of response to IFN-l in the CNS. In the
choroid plexus, however, endothelial cells are fenestrated. In this
structure, the blood-brain barrier is formed by the tight junctions
occurring between the cuboidal epithelial cells (Figure 8G).
Response of these cells to IFN-l suggests that they express the
IFN-l receptor on their basolateral membrane which is accessible

to factors diffusing from the bloodstream. The low responsiveness
of the CNS to IFN-l does not appear to result solely from the
combination of the blood-brain barrier and lack of endothelial cell
responsiveness. Our RT-PCR data show that expression of the IL￾28Ra receptor chain is very low in the entire brain. This suggests
that, even in inflammatory conditions (such as in MS or during
viral infection) known to affect the integrity of the blood-brain
barrier, the CNS would be expected to respond poorly to IFN-l.
This fits with the observation that IFNAR1-KO mice (which have
an intact IFN-l system) exhibit extreme susceptibility to many
neurotropic viral infections [45]. It will be of interest to test
whether, owing to the low responsiveness of the CNS, IFN-l
would exhibit less toxicity than IFN-a/b. This might be of interest
if the effective targets of the IFN treatment are in the periphery
and, of course, responsive to IFN-l.
Redundancy of type I and type III IFN systems and
relevance to viral pathogenesis
Although type I and type III IFNs signal through different
receptors, these two IFN families share common features.
Production of both IFN types can be triggered by the same
stimuli and responses of cells to type I and type III IFNs involves
the upregulation of the same set of genes. Why these two
seemingly redundant systems co-evolved is not fully clear. Previous
data based on cell lines and primary cells responsiveness to IFN-l
suggested that a key difference between the type I and type III IFN
systems could be the cell specificity of IFN-l receptor expression
[18,26]. Our work confirms that, in vivo, a major difference
between the type I and type III IFN systems is the cell type￾restricted nature of responses to IFN-l. Type III IFN appears to
have evolved primarily as a protection of epithelial cells. However,
type I IFN also acts on these cells, leaving open the question of
redundancy.
On one hand, IFN-l could be viewed as a leftover of an
ancestral antiviral protection system that arose to protect simple
organisms. In the evolution, type III IFN-like genes, which occur
in the genome of the fish, appear to have preceded type I IFN
genes that emerged with the development of birds and tetrapods
[52]. Type I IFN would have evolved faster to become the primary
antiviral protection system, active in many cell types. In this
hypothesis, IFN-l would only play the role of a back-up system.
On the other hand, the co-existence of two systems with
overlapping specificities might have been selected because both
systems contribute to the protection against live-threatening and/
or widespread pathogenic viruses or microorganisms. Our data
suggest that the primary function of IFN-l would be the protection
of epithelial structures. Many viruses use epithelial cells as primary
replication sites. These include viruses like poxviruses, herpesvi￾ruses and influenza virus that could have had enough impact on
species populations to drive some evolution of the genomes. The
effect of IFN-l against vaginal infection by HSV-2 [17], the
inverse correlation between rhinovirus-induced IFN-l expression
and viral load in infected volunteers [53], and the antagonistic
activity of Yaba-like virus against IFN-l [11], support an active
role for this IFN. IFN-l is thus also expected to contribute to the
defense of respiratory epithelia, against influenza virus. Accord￾ingly, recent findings suggest that IFN-l contributes to the
protection of airways against influenza A virus, through induction
of Mx gene expression (Markus Mordstein and Peter Staeheli,
unpublished observations). IFN-l might also be instrumental in
the early defense of the intestinal mucosa against very common
pathogens such as rotaviruses or possibly against bacteria. Further
studies are needed to confirm that, in these tissues, the primary
targets of IFN-l activity are also the epithelial cells, and to evaluate
how much protection is added by the IFN-l system to the very
potent IFN-a/b system. The notion that some differential
regulation exists in the production of type I and type III IFNs
might also broaden the range of the response or accelerate the
reactivity of the body to some specific pathogens.
Materials and Methods
Mice
3–4 week-old female FVB/N, 129/Sv, C57BL/6 mice (infection
experiments) and 7–8 week-old female or male FVB/N mice
(electroinjection experiments) were obtained from Charles River
Laboratories or from the animal facility of the Univ. of Louvain,
Belgium. Congenic mice carrying a functional Mx1 gene were
from the breeding colony of the Univ. of Freiburg, Germany.
These mice were BALB.A2G-Mx1 and B6.A2G-Mx1 (designated
Mx1/WT) [54] as well as B6.A2G-Mx1 mice lacking a functional
type I IFN receptor (designated Mx1/IFNAR1-KO) [55].
Handling of mice and experimental procedures were conducted
in accordance with national and institutional guidelines for animal
care and use (Agreement ref. UCL/MD/2006/034).
Viruses and infection
Viruses used in this study were: Theiler’s murine encephalo￾myelitis virus (TMEV) persistent strain DA (DA1 molecular clone),
and neurovirulent strain GDVII [40], La Crosse virus deleted
from the NSs gene (LACVdelNSs) [56], mouse hepatitis virus,
strain A59 (MHV-A59) [57] and lactate dehydrogenase-elevating
virus of the Riley strain (LDV) [58].
Intracerebral infections (i.c.) were done by injection of
40 microliters of serum-free medium containing 103 PFU of
TMEV(GDVII), 105 PFU of TMEV(DA), or 26104 TCID50 of
MHV-A59. Control mice were injected with 40 microliters of
serum-free culture medium. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) infections were
performed by injection of 250 microliters of serum-free medium
containing 104 PFU of LACVdelNSs, 26107 ID50 of LDV, or 1 or
26104 TCID50 of MHV-A59.
RNA extraction and real-time reverse transcription (RT)-
PCR
Mice were anesthetized and perfused with PBS before organs
harvest. RNA was isolated from organs using the technique
described by Chomczynski and Sacchi [59] and reverse-tran￾scribed as previously described [60]. Real-time RT-PCR was
performed, as described previously [60], using SybrGreen and the
iCycler or the MyIQTM apparatus (Biorad). Standards consisted of
10-fold dilutions of known concentrations of murine genomic
DNA, of plasmids carrying the PCR fragment of interest (pCR4-
Topo, Invitrogen) or plasmid pcDNA3-IFN-a5 [10] or pEF-IFN￾l3 [16] (kindly provided by S. Kotenko). Primers sequences and
PCR conditions used are presented in Table 1. The IFN-subtype
specificity of primers for IFN-a5 was confirmed. No PCR product
was detected when plasmids encoding the other IFN-a subtypes
were used as templates. Moreover, when genomic DNA was used
as template, the IFN-a5 gene segment was specifically amplified, as
confirmed by sequencing of the PCR products.
Plasmids
The firefly luciferase gene was cloned from pGL3 (Promega) in
pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) using HindIII-XbaI restriction sites, to yield
pCS41. Plasmid pcDNA3-muIFNa6T [10] was subjected to site
directed mutagenesis [61] with oligonucleotide TM439 (59 GGA
GGG TTG CAT TCC AAG CAG CAG A 39) to generate the
Asp to Asn78 mutant (D78N) that carries a N-glycosylation site.
Type I and Type III IFNs In Vivo
PLoS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 10 2008 | Volume 4 | Issue 3 | e1000017

The mutated IFN-a6T region was recloned in pcDNA3 and
sequenced to make sure that no unexpected mutation occurred
during the mutagenesis procedure.
MuIFN-l3, was cloned from pEF-2-mIFN-l3 [16] into
pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) using Asp718-EcoRI restriction sites. The
human IFNGR2 signal sequence and the N-terminal FLAG
coding sequences present in pEF-2-mIFN-l3 were replaced by a
sequence encoding the wild-type murine IFN-l3 signal sequence.
To this end, the 39 complementary primers TM723 (59 AAA GGT
ACC GCC ACC ATG CTC CTC CTG CTG TTG CCT CTG
CTG CTG GCC GCA 39) and TM724 (59 AAA GGA TCC
GCT TGG GTT CTT GCT AGC ACT GCG GCC AGC AGC
AGA GGC AA 39) were used for PCR and the resulting fragment
was cloned in the recombinant plasmid using the Asp718 and
BamHI restriction sites. The muIFN-l3 region was sequenced to
make sure that no unexpected mutation occurred during PCR and
subcloning steps. The plasmid obtained, pcDNA3-IFN-l3,
encodes a wild-type muIFN-l3 with a wild-type signal sequence.
A similar procedure was followed to obtain pcDNA3-IFN-l2 from
pEF-2-mIFN-l2 [16].
DNA electroinjection
Mice were anesthetized with 200 ml of a mix of Medetomidin
hydrochlorid 100 mg/ml (Domitor) and Ketamine 500 mg/ml
(Anesketin) given i.m. Before DNA injection, mice were shaved
locally, using depilatory cream. 10 mg of endotoxin free plasmid
DNA (Qiagen endofree) in 25 ml of PBS were injected in the left
and right tibialis anterior muscles of the mice. Electric pulses (80 V
per 4 mm, 8 pulses, 20 msec/pulse, pause: 480 msec) were then
administered using a Cliniporator system (Cliniporator, IGEA,
Carpi, Italy) equipped with 4 mm electrode plates [62]. For all
experiments, conductive gel was used to ensure electrical contact
with the skin (EKO-GEL, ultrasound transmission gel, Egna,
Italy). Mice were then woken up by i.m. injection of 250 ml of
Atipamezol 500 mg/ml (Antisedan).
In vivo imaging
Mice were anesthetized as for DNA electroinjection and given
3 mg of Luciferin (Xenogen) in 100 ml of PBS, intraperitoneally.
10 min after luciferin injection, luciferase activity was monitored
in vivo using a CCD camera (IVIS 50, Xenogen) [63]. Mice were
then woken up, as described above.
Immunohistochemistry
Mice were anesthetized before being euthanized for organs
harvest. They were perfused with PBS. Freshly collected brains
and kidneys were immersed in buffered formaldehyde 4% for 24h
at room temperature and then embedded in paraffin. Tissue
sections of 8 mm in thickness were cut, placed on SuperFrost Plus
slides, dried at 37uC overnight, and processed by standard
methods for immunohistochemistry. Briefly, sections were depar￾affinized, permeabilized for 5 min in phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) containing 0.1% Triton X-100, and washed in PBS.
Sections were then treated for 90 min at 97uC in sodium citrate
buffer 0.01 M - pH 5.8, to unmask antigens. Blocking was
performed by incubating sections for 1 hour with normal goat
Serum (Sigma) diluted 1/50 in PBS. Then, immunolabeling was
done in blocking solution containing the antibodies. Mx1 protein
was detected with rabbit polyclonal antibody AP5 [64] that
recognizes the C-terminal 16 amino acids of Mx1. It was used at a
dilution of 1/150. For immunofluorescent labeling, the secondary
antibody (at 1/800) was a goat anti-rabbit antibody coupled to
Alexa 488 (Molecular Probes).
