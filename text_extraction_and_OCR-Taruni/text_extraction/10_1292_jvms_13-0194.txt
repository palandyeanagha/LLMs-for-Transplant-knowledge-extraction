ABSTRACT. An 8-year-old male mongrel dog that had undergone renal transplantation was presented 25 days later with an acute cough, 
anorexia and exercise intolerance. During the investigation, neutrophilic leukocytosis was noted, and thoracic radiographs revealed caudal 
lung lobe infiltration. While being treated with two broad-spectrum antibiotics, clinical signs worsened. Pneumonia due to infection with 
multidrug-resistant (MDR) Pseudomonas (P.) aeruginosa, sensitive only to imipenem and amikacin, was confirmed by bacteria isolation. 
After treatment with imipenem-cilastatin without reducing the immunosuppressant dose, clinical signs completely resolved. During the 
2-year follow-up period, no recurrence was observed. To the best of authors’ knowledge, this is the first report of pneumonia caused by 
MDR P. aeruginosa in a renal recipient dog and successful management of this disease.

Infectious pneumonia is a severe complication at the 
early stage of kidney transplantation and is associated with 
significant mortality in recipients not only in human clinics 
but also in veterinary medicine [11, 12, 22]. However, no 
standard guidelines for managing infectious complications 
after transplantation have been set in veterinary medicine. 
Potent immunosuppressants given to prevent host rejection 
could increase opportunities for microorganism infection 
and lead to difficulties with treatment [6]. Previous reports 
in humans have suggested that significantly reducing immu￾nosuppressant doses are extremely important to treat bacte￾rial pneumonia in kidney transplant recipients [19]. Unlike 
human and feline renal transplant patients, canine recipients 
require highly aggressive immunosuppressive therapy, 
because of the intense host response these animals mount 
against the graft [9]. A previous veterinary report has shown 
that the death of canine patients can occur due to graft rejec￾tion when immunosuppressive drug doses are decreased to 
control infectious pneumonia [11]. Therefore, it is difficult 
for veterinarians to decide whether the doses of immunosup￾pressant reagents should be reduced to treat an infection in 
a transplant recipient. In this report, we describe a case of 
pneumonia due to infection with MDR P. aeruginosa in a 
kidney recipient dog during the high-risk period of acute al￾lorejection and the successful treatment of this case without 
reducing the immunosuppressive medication dose.
An 8-year-old, 6.3 kg, male mongrel dog was referred 
to Kangwon National University Veterinary Hospital for 
treatment of end-stage chronic kidney disease. The dog un￾derwent heterotrophic renal transplantation in the iliac fossa 
with a kidney from a healthy dog leukocyte antigen cross￾matched littermate donor. To assess whether a littermate dog 
is compatible as a kidney donor, blood typing, erythrocyte 
cross-match and complement-dependent cytotoxic cross￾match tests were performed [14]. The transplant recipient 
also underwent bilateral native nephrectomy and had been 
given 20 mg/kg microemulsified cyclosporine (Implanta, 
PO, q24h; Hanmi, Seoul, Korea), 1 mg/kg predinisolone 
(Solondo, PO, q24h; Yuhanmedica, Ochang, Korea) and 
5 mg/kg azathioprine (Immuthera, PO, q48h; Celltrion, 
Incheon, Korea) as immunosuppressive therapy 2 days prior 
to transplantation according to a previously described proto￾col [14]. The cyclosporine trough concentration was main￾tained approximately 400–700 ng/ml for the first 6 months 
after surgery, and then the dosage was reduced to maintain 
a trough concentration of 250–350 ng/ml as measured by 
high-performed liquid chromatography [3]. Prednisolone 
dose was gradually reduced 1 month after surgery and dis￾continued after 3 months [14]. We administered 22 mg/kg 
cefazolin (Cefazolin, IV, q12h; Chong Kun Dang Pharm, 
Seoul, Korea) for 5 days after surgery as prophylaxis. The 
dog showed good postoperative recovery. Laboratory evalu￾ation results including complete blood count (CBC), serum 
biochemistry, urinalysis and ultrasonography were also nor￾mal 18 days after transplantation.
Twenty-five days after surgery, the dog was readmitted to 
the hospital due to acute onset anorexia, frequent coughing 
and exercise intolerance. Physical examination revealed a 
body condition score of 4/9, mild exertional dyspnea, in￾creased respiratory rate (36 breaths/min) and fever (39.8°C). 
Slight crackling lung sounds were also heard during inspi￾ration, but a cardiac murmur was not detected. Laboratory

examination including serum chemistry analysis, blood gas 
analysis, pulse oxymetry, urine examination, excretory 
urography and ultrasonography did not produce any atypical 
findings. Lung lobe infiltration and air bronchogram signs 
with a generalized increase in lung opacity in both the left 
and right side caudal lobes were viewed on ventrodorsal and 
right lateral thoracic radiographs (Fig. 1a and 1b). CBC test 
results (Fig. 2) were indicative of neutrophilic leukocytosis 
(37.0 × 103/µl, reference range 4 to 15.5 × 103/µl) with a 
mild left shift (band neutrophils 1.0 × 103/µl, reference range 
0 to 0.3 × 103/µl). Results of a canine distemper polymerase 
chain reaction (PCR) test (Neodin Vetlab, Seoul, Korea) and 
heartworm antigen kit test (SNAP® Heartworm RT Test, 
IDEXX Laboratories Inc., Westbrook, ME, U.S.A.) were 
negative (data not shown). There was no clinical evidence of 
renal graft failure or rejection based on the results of CBC, 
serum chemistry and urinalysis.
We made a provisional diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia 
based on radiography, CBC and physical examination find￾ings. Empirical treatments were started with a combination 
of two broad-spectrum antibiotics [10 mg/kg enrofloxacine 
(Baytril, SQ, q24h; Bayer Korea, Seoul, Korea) and 22 mg/
kg ampicillin-sulbactam (Ucillin, IV, q12h; Dongkoo, Seoul, 
Korea)], fluids, nebulizer treatment combined with genta￾mycin (Gentamycin sulfate, Kukje, Seongnam, Korea) and 
coupage for 5 days until the final diagnosis was made. We 
continued immunosuppressive therapy without any dosage 
reduction due to concerns about the high risk for acute rejec￾tion during the early stage of kidney allograft.
A microorganism culture test was performed with tra￾cheal wash fluid, blood and urine from the recipient dog as 
well as blood and urine from the donor animal. To obtain a 
tracheal wash specimen, the canine was anesthetized with 5 
mg/kg propofol (Provive, Myungmoon, Seoul, Korea). We 
subsequently inserted an endotracheal tube with a rubber 
catheter into the trachea, pushed in 5 ml of warm saline and 
immediately withdrew the liquid to collect a sample. Bacte￾rial pneumonia caused by P. aeruginosa was confirmed by 
a microorganism isolation test carried out according to a 
previous protocol [18]. Test results revealed that the bacte￾rial infection was localized in the respiratory tract. Bacterial 
cultures of urine and blood from both the recipient and donor 
were both aerobically and anaerobically negative. Despite 
administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics (enrofloxacine 
and ampicillin-sulbactam) for 5 days, clinical symptoms of 
the recipient dog did not improve.

The P. aeruginosa strain isolated from the tracheal wash￾ing was sensitive to only imipenem and amikacin, had inter￾mediate susceptibility to gentamycine and polymixinB; and 
was resistant to ceftazidime, piperacillin and ciprofloxacine. 
The patient was started on 5 mg/kg imipenem-cilastatin 
(Imipenem-cilastatin, IV over 30 min, q8h; Yungjin, Goy￾ang, Korea). After 10 days of treatment, the cough and nasal 
discharge had markedly diminished, and neutrophil counts 
were in the normal range (Fig. 2). Lung lesions observed 
on thoracic radiographs had clearly improved. (Fig. 1c and 
1d). Blood urea nitrogen (17–25 mg/dl, reference range 5–30 
mg/dl) and serum creatinine (0.9–1.3 mg/dl, reference range 
0.7–1.8 mg/dl) concentrations were maintained within the 
reference range during the entire post-transplantation period 
(Fig. 3a and 3b). Blood cyclosporine levels did not show 
any marked changes during the course of anti-pneumonia 
therapy (Fig. 3c). The antibiotic therapy was continued for 
1 week, after all symptoms had subsided to prevent recur￾rent pneumonia. No complications or disease recurrence was 
observed during the 2-year follow-up period.
Reports of renal transplantation in canines have been 
sporadically published in veterinary literature [11]. Most of 
these studies have focused on the effectiveness of immuno￾suppression protocols, surgical techniques and the survival 
of the animal recipients [4, 9, 17]. Although some reports 
have briefly described successful recovery from bacterial 
complications that were not due to MDR strains, others have 
presented cases in which the infections did not respond 
well to treatment with antimicrobials [9, 11]. Infection with 
multidrug-resistant (MDR) Pseudomonas (P.) aeruginosa in 
kidney transplant recipients leads to life-threatening compli￾cation in humans [16]. This condition is difficult to manage 
due to the limited susceptibility of MDR P. aeruginosa to 
antibiotics [7, 15]. To the best of our knowledge, several case 
reports on this topic have been published in human medicine, 
but no report has appeared in veterinary medical literature 
and no standard guidelines for diagnosis or treatment have 
been established for animal recipients [15, 16, 20, 23].
We performed a tracheal wash to obtain a sample to 
identify the best antibiotics for the bacteria isolated from 
the trachea. Cultivation of sputum or blood is not specific 
and sensitive method to distinguish real pathogen. On the 
other hand, transbronchial or open lung biopsy is effective 
for diagnosis, but is associated with high morbidity [19]. In 
our protocol, the recovery of a patient from anesthesia and 
tracheal wash procedure was relatively fast, and no compli￾cation has occurred. Tracheal wash would be a necessary 
protocol for early diagnosis of pulmonary infection in the 
canine transplant patients.
The strong immunosuppressants that are administered to 
prevent host rejection can increase the risk of bacterial infec￾tion, because these reagents impair cell-mediated immunity 
while reducing T cell and immunoglobulin function. More￾over, neutrophils and alveolar macrophages also become 
unresponsive to chemoattractants and their phagocytotic ac￾tivities decrease [5]. In the case presented in this report, we 
did not reduce the immunosuppressant drug dosage, because 
sufficient immunosupression is necessary to prevent organ 
rejection during the early stage of transplantation and reduc￾ing the medication dosage could lead to irreversible acute 
organ rejection and eventual failure.
It is unclear how MDR P. aeruginosa pneumonia occurred. 
We speculate that the MDR P. aeruginosa infection in this 
case was opportunistic or acquired in the hospital. P. aerugi￾nosa is an opportunistic human and animal pathogen that can 
be isolated from the ear canal, skin, nasal cavity and mouth 
of healthy dogs [18]. This bacterial strain is the second most 
common (17%) cause of nosocomial pneumonia in human 
clinics [7]. However, no surveillance data are available for 
veterinary patients to determine which microorganism is the 
most common cause of pulmonary infections.
P. aeruginosa is notorious for its MDR characteristics 
and causes concern among clinicians, because it can induce 
a life-threatening disease in immunocompromised patients 
[18]. In the present case, we used erofloxacin and ampi￾cillin-sulbactam for the initial treatment protocol. These 
antibiotics are recommended for ameliorating severe and 
community-acquired cases of pneumonia [10, 21]. However, 
the reagents we administered were ineffective against the 
MDR P. aeruginosa infection in this case. P. aeruginosa is 
often resistant to ampicillin, cephalosporin, chloramphenicol 
and sulphonamides [1]. The traditionally preferred antibiot￾ics include ciprofloxacine, ceftazidime, aminoglycosides 
and carbapenem [2, 7, 18]. In human medicine, new anti￾pseudomonal antibiotics including doripenem, ceftobiprole 
and sitafloxacine have been dispensed due to the increased 
resistance rate of P. aeruginosa against traditionally pre￾ferred antibiotics [7]. A more recent study reported that the 
resistance rates of P. aeruginosa isolated from dogs and 
cats against enrofloxacine, ciprofloxacine and cefotaxime 
were 31.5, 20.5 and 17.8%, respectively [8]. Another report 
showed that large numbers of P. aeruginosa isolated from 
canine otitis externae are resistant to enrofloxacine (51.9%) 
and gentamycin (43.3%) [13].
In the present study, we showed that tracheal washing was 
a safe and effective approach for making an early diagnosis 
of pneumonia during the initial stage of renal transplanta￾tion in canines. We demonstrated that localized pneumonia 
caused by MDR P. aeruginosa infection after renal trans￾plantation in a dog could be treated using appropriate anti￾biotics according to the results of an antibiotic susceptibility 
test. We suggest that small animal clinicians do not need to 
consider reducing the dosage of immunosuppressants to treat 
MDR P. aeruginosa pneumonia during the early stage of 
renal transplantation in canines. However, effective manage￾ment protocols for systemic MDR P. aeruginosa-associated 
complications, such as bacteremia, neutropenia and vascular 
dehiscence, in canine renal transplant patients should be de￾scribed in future studies. Our case report provides beneficial 
data for establishing standardized diagnostic and therapeutic 
guidelines to manage MDR bacterial pneumonia in canine 
renal transplant patients.
