Abstract
Background and aims: Acid gastro-oesophageal reflux is one of the
most important causes of chronic cough. The response to acid
suppression in these patients is not as good as in patients with
heartburn but improvement with antireflux surgery has been
reported, suggesting the involvement of a non-acidic gastric
component in the refluxate. Less acidic reflux may produce
symptoms such as regurgitation or chest pain. We investigated
whether chronic cough might be associated with weakly acidic
reflux.
Methods: We studied 28 patients with chronic cough using 24 hour
ambulatory pressure-pH-impedance monitoring. Manometry was
used for precise recognition of cough and impedance-pHmetry to
detect acid (pH <4), weakly acidic (pH 7–4), and weakly alkaline
(impedance drops, pH ⩾7) reflux. A symptom association
probability (SAP) analysis was performed for each type of reflux.
Results: Analysis was completed in 22 patients with 24 cough
events (5–92)/patient. The majority of cough events (69.4%) were
considered “independent” of reflux whereas 30.6% occurred within
two minutes of a reflux episode. Half of these (49%) were “reflux
cough” sequences, involving acid (65%), weakly acidic (29%), and
weakly alkaline (6%) reflux. Ten patients (45%) had a positive SAP
between reflux and cough: five with acid, two with acid and weakly
acidic, and three only with weakly acidic reflux.
Conclusions: Ambulatory pressure-pH-impedance monitoring with
SAP analysis allowed precise determination of the temporal
association between cough and gastro-oesophageal reflux (acid,
weakly acidic, and weakly alkaline) and identification of a
subgroup of patients with chronic cough clearly associated with
weakly acidic gastro-oesophageal reflux.
