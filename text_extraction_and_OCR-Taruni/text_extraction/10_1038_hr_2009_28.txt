Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, alternatively known as stress cardiomyopathy, is an increasingly recognized clinical syndrome
characterized by acute reversible apical ventricular dysfunction. To elucidate the mechanism, we tried to make a new model
of takotsubo-like cardiomyopathy in non-human primates. Echocardiography revealed that repeated intravenous infusion of
epinephrine overdose in cynomolgus monkeys induced takotsubo-like cardiomyopathy, which is characterized by progressive
left ventricle and depressed systolic function with severe hypokinesis in apical regions and hyperkinesis in the basal region.
Although this cardiac dysfunction almost normalized after a month even without any treatment, metoprolol, a b-blocker,
improved the decreased ejection fraction earlier than in the control. Luxol fast blue staining, which is useful for estimating
myocytolysis, showed that increased myocytolysis was observed in the apical ventricle of the epinephrine-infused heart.
Metoprolol diminished epinephrine-induced cardiomyocytolysis. To explain the mechanism of takotsubo myopathy and the effect
of metoprolol, gene expressions in apical or basal ventricle were compared. Heart failure-related genes, such as brain natriuretic
peptide, connective tissue growth factor and osteopontin; calcium signaling-related genes, such as ryanodine receptor 2,
sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase 2A2 and adenylate cyclase 7; renin–angiotensin system-related genes, such as
angiotensinogen, angiotensin II receptor, type 1 and type 2; and mitochondria-related genes, such as peroxisome proliferator￾activated receptor-c co-activator-1a, cytochrome c and transcription factor A mitochondrial, were significantly changed at the
apical ventricle rather than at the basal ventricle. The changes of some genes improved with metoprolol treatment. These results
indicate that this model is valuable in understanding the pathogenesis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy and the effectivity of b-blockers.

INTRODUCTION
A new cardiac disease characterized by extensive akinesia with balloon￾ing, without significant coronary artery lesion, has recently been
reported.1–6 Clinically, it is characterized by acute onset of chest pain
and is associated with ECG changes such as ST elevation, ST depression
or deep T-wave inversion. It has been named takotsubo cardiomyopathy
because of the shape taken by the left ventricle. The following triggering
factors were observed: sudden psychological or physical stress,1,7–9
severe physiological and emotional stress in a setting of a large
catastrophic event such as an earthquake10 and accidental iatrogenic
epinephrine overdose.11,12 Although all these cases revealed transient left
ventricular (LV) dysfunction with severe chest pain and ECG changes
that precipitate in acute myocardial infarction, LV function recovered
within 2–4 weeks of presentation. Nevertheless, the pathophysiological
mechanism underlying the transient LV apical ballooning is unclear.
Interestingly, there have been several reports about the relationship
between takotsubo cardiomyopathy and hypertension. For example, a
takotsubo-like cardiomyopathy has been associated with a pheochro￾mocytoma which is one of the causes of secondary hypertension.13,14
Ionescu reported a case of takotsubo cardiomyaopathy in a female
patient with a history of poorly controlled hypertension.15 She had
dynamic obstruction of the outflow tract and moderate secondary
mitral regurgitation. Furthermore, patients without myocardial ische￾mia developed LV apical or basal akinesis as a result of hypertensive
response during exercise stress.16 These reports suggest that takotsubo
cardiomyopathy can be one of the potential causes of secondary
hypertension.
Cardiotoxic effects of excessive catecholamine blood level have been
documented for several decades in experimental models and in the
human heart.17–19 It is known that excessive doses of catecholamines

produce diffuse myocardial destruction with myocyte loss and necro￾sis, as well as extensive fibrosis. Rat,20 rabbit21 and canine22 have been
used as experimental models of heart failure using excessive dosing of
catecholamine. However, earlier high-dose catecholamine infusion
models are used to investigate the mechanism of chronic or acute
heart failure. Various mechanisms of epinephrine-induced cardiotoxi￾city have been postulated to be involved in the pathogenesis of
cardiomyopathy. Catecholamine-induced myocardial cell damage
and fibrosis result from a reduction in intracellular glutathione level
with an accumulation of reactive oxygen radicals.23 Catecholamine￾induced coronary vasoconstriction with radical generation resulting
from ischemia produces characteristic myocardial lesions that include
focal myofiber necrosis and degeneration and mononuclear leukocytic
infiltration.18,19 Catecholamine-induced increase in myocardial Ca2+
content results in over-stimulation of myofilaments, increase in
contractile force and oxygen requirement, as well as excessive ATP
breakdown, contributing to cardiac muscle cell injury. However, an
impaired cardiac performance in many animal models is irreversible.
Recently, we reported that real-time three-dimensional echocardio￾graphy provides not only the three-dimensional LV shape in motion
but also accurately estimates LV volume and function in cynomolgus
monkeys.24,25 Our preliminary data have shown that the acute effect of
excess epinephrine-induced LV dysfunction in cynomolgus monkeys
can be measured using echocardiographic parameters, and this model
has the characteristic syndrome, namely, extensive akinesia of the
apical and mid portions of the left ventricle. Accordingly, the main
purpose of this study is to determine if acutely excessive epinephrine
in a non-human primate is associated with takotsubo-like LV dysfunc￾tion. Furthermore, to address the therapy of LV dysfunction in this
model, metoprolol, a b-blocker, was administered.
METHODS
Animals
All procedures involving animals were approved by the animal care and use
committee of Shin Nippon Biomedical Laboratories and Osaka City University,
and were performed in accordance with standards published by the National
Research Council (Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, NIH
OACU) and the National Institutes of Health Policy on Human Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals.
Male cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis, purpose-bred) aged 4–6
years, originally imported from China, were used in this study. After a 1-month
international quarantine, the animals were acclimated to the test facility’s stock
colony until use. The monkeys were housed singly in stainless-steeled cages
63 cm wide by 76 cm high by 76 cm deep (conforming to NIH requirements) in
a test room maintained at a temperature of 26±2 1C and 50±10% humidity
with artificial lighting from 0600 to 1800 hours and with air changes 10 times
per hour. The animals were fed Teklad Global 25% Protein Primate Diet
(Harlan Sprague Dawley Inc., Indianapolis, IN, USA) and water (on-site well)
was provided ad libitum. On the day of the experiments, the animals weighed
between 4.0 and 6.0 kg.
Experimental protocol
On the day of experiment, the animals were anesthetized with inhalation of
isoflurane (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL, USA), and orotracheal
intubation was performed without any muscle relaxant using a 3.0 mm
endotracheal tube (107-030, Mallinckrodt Medical Ltd, Hazelwood, MO,
USA). The animals were maintained under anesthesia with 1.0% isoflurane
and mechanically ventilated through an endotracheal tube. The animals were
placed in the left lateral position, and heart rate was maintained at
130±10 b.p.m. for real-time three-dimensional echocardiographic measure￾ment. The opened circuit anesthetic system was supplied with a fresh gas flow
of 3 l min1 of 20–40% oxygen monitored at the common gas outlet and the
balance of nitrogen. Body temperature was kept between 36.5 and 38.0 1C by
use of a water flow warming system (MICROTEMP II, Japan Medical Dynamic
Marketing Inc., Tokyo, Japan).
Echocardiographic (real-time three-dimensional) measurements were per￾formed, as described earlier.24,25 Baseline measurements of all the animals were
performed, and epinephrine (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) was infused intra￾venously. Acute cardiomyopathy, namely, acute LV dysfunction, was induced in
25 cynomolgus monkeys by two repetitive epinephrine infusions at a rate of
10 mg kg1 min1. However, after measuring the echocardiographic parameters
on day 3, animals with an ejection fraction (EF) value less than 40 were selected
as the acute cardiomyopathy model animals.
In the first experiment, cardiomyopathy monkeys were randomly divided
into two groups as follows: saline group (n¼6) or metoprolol group (n¼4).
After measuring the baseline values of echocardiographic parameters in each
animal, saline or metoprolol (0.3 mg kg1 min1) was infused intravenously for
10 min. The parameters were recorded 10 min after starting the infusion,
and 30 and 120 min, and 1, 10 and 30 days after the end of infusion. For
intravenous administration, metoprolol was dissolved in saline.
In the second experiment, the cardiomyopathy monkeys were killed on day 1
after saline (n¼5) or metoprolol (n¼4) infusion for histological evaluation
and RNA analysis. Normal monkeys without epinephrine (n¼5) were used as
control.
Assessment of LV function in real-time three-dimensional
echocardiography
Acquisition of one full volume took 5–8 s. The pyramidal data set obtained
from the apical four-chamber view contained the whole heart structure. Data
analysis was performed using the Tom Tec 4D Cardio-View RT. Eight long￾itudinal levels at intervals of 451 were selected around this rotation axis. After
planimetering the eight levels, LV volume (end-diastolic value and end-systolic
value) was calculated using the measuring algorithm. A number of parameters
were then calculated.
Histological evaluation
Tissue slices from each heart were embedded in paraffin. To determine
myocytolysis in myocardial tissue, Luxol fast blue staining (Kluver–Barrera’s
stain) was performed, as described earlier.26 Deparaffinized and hydrated
sections were stained for 24 h with the Luxol fast blue solution (0.1% Solvent
Blue 38, 0.5% acetic acid in alcohol) at a 58 1C. Differentiation was performed
with 0.05% lithium carbonate solution for 15 s and with 70% ethanol for
3 min. After differentiation, the tissues were stained in a cresyl violet solution
for 7 min at 37 1C and were then dehydrated.
RNA analysis
RNA from the basal and apical portions of the left ventricles was isolated using
ISOGEN (Nippon Gene, Toyama, Japan) and purified with the RNeasy Fibrous
Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA). To elucidate the gene expression
levels, we subjected the RNA samples to quantitative real-time RT-PCR (ABI
Prism 7700, Perkin Elmer Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). One-step
quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR reactions were performed
using 100 ng of total RNA per reaction. TaqMan primers and probes were
designed using Primer 3 (v. 0.4.0); see Table 1. For normalization, transcript
levels were compared with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.
Statistical analysis
All data are presented as mean±s.e.m. Comparisons among the groups were
made by one-way analysis of variance. For differences between two groups,
Student’s t-test was used when appropriate. Differences were considered
statistically significant at a value of Po0.05.
RESULTS
Acute experimental cardiomyopathy
Nine of the 25 cynomolgus monkeys died suddenly during or shortly
after the first or second epinephrine infusion. In the ECG, ventricular
fibrillation was induced after bundle branch type premature ventri￾cular contraction, tachycardia (VT) and polymorphic VT after the end

of the first epinephrine infusion (Figure 1). Suddenly, massive
hemorrhage through tracheal cannula was observed in all monkeys
that died, and pulmonary edema and pulmonary hemorrhage were
found at autopsy.
Effects of metoprolol on acute experimental cardiomyopathy
Echocardiographic examinations showed that infusion of epinephrine
induced cardiomyopathy (EFo40%) with takotsubo-like apical aki￾nesia, a form of LV systolic dysfunction characterized by extensive
apical akinesia with normal or hypercontractile baseline segments in a
three-dimensional echocardiogram. Epinephrine infusion produced a
marked increase in systolic and diastolic pressures with transient reflex
bradycardia immediately after starting the infusion. However, heart
rate increased severely thereafter, and tachycardia lasted throughout
the epinephrine infusion (Figure 2a). Changes in blood pressure and
heart rate during the second epinephrine infusion were similar to
those seen during the first infusion (Figure 2b).
Figure 3 shows the time course of EF. Metoprolol significantly
improved LV dysfunction, including the decreased EF and abnormal
wall motion of the apical portion, at 10 min (40.5±1.3%) and 24 h
after the end of infusion. Although metoprolol tended to show
improvement in EF from 10 to 30 days after the end of infusion,
cardiac dysfunction by the epinephrine injection almost normalized
after a month even without any treatment.

Effects of metoprolol on myocytolysis
In the second set of experiments, after echocardiography, left ventricles
were excised and a part embedded in paraffin at 24 h after metoprolol
infusion. As reproducible results, metoprolol significantly improved
the decrease in EF by epinephrine (Figure 4a). Next, to elucidate
myocytolysis in the monkey heart, Luxol fast blue staining was
performed. Increased myocytolysis was observed in the apical region
of the epinephrine-infused heart. Metoprolol diminished cardiomyo￾cytolysis caused by epinephrine (Figure 4b).
Effects of metoprolol on gene expression in the acute
cardiomyopathy model
To explain the effect of epinephrine and metoprolol on gene expres￾sion in each portion of the heart, quantitative real-time reverse
transcriptase-PCR was performed using RNA samples isolated from
the apical or basal portions of the left ventricle of each group. We
investigated the expression levels involved in heart failure-, calcium
signaling-, renin–angiotensin system-, mitochondria- and adrenalin￾related genes.
As shown in Figure 5a, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP)/natriuretic
peptide precursor B (NPPB), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF)
and osteopontin (OPN) in apical myocardium were remarkably
increased by epinephrine. BNP expression was also increased in
basal myocardium, but CTGF was not affected by epinephrine. OPN
tended to decrease rather in the basal region. The apical CTGF
expression level was similar to that in the basal level in control
monkeys, whereas apical BNP and OPN levels were 1.6-fold and
2.6-fold higher, respectively, than those in basal regions. The ratio of

the apical to basal portions regarding these expressions was signifi￾cantly increased by epinephrine and tended to be normalized by
metoprolol (data not shown).
The mRNA abundance of ryanodine receptor-2 (RYR2) and sarco￾endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase-2A2 (SERCA2) was significantly
decreased by epinephrine injection at the apical portion. Furthermore,
the expression of adenylate cyclase-7 (ADCY7) was significantly
increased at the same portion by epinephrine. These changes tended
to improve by metoprolol treatment. On the other hand, these
expression changes at the basal portion were smaller or the opposite
(Figure 5b). There was no significant difference in these gene expres￾sions between basal and apical hearts of control monkeys.
We next examined the effect of renin–angiotensin system. At
only the apical portion, were angiotensinogen (AGT) and angiotensin
II receptor type-2 (AGTR2) significantly upregulated, whereas
angiotensin II receptor type-1 (AGTR1) was downregulated by
epinephrine (Figure 5c). These changes were not much improved by
metoprolol.
Mitochondria-related genes such as peroxisome proliferator-acti￾vated receptor-g co-activator-1a (PGC-1a), cytochrome c (CYCS) and
transcription factor A mitochondrial (TFAM) at the apical portion
were significantly reduced by epinephrine, and some of them were
improved with metoprolol treatment (Figure 5d). Apical PGC-1a level
was 2.4-fold higher than that of the basal in control hearts.
Finally, we checked the expressions of adorenoceptor-related genes
such as adrenergic receptor, b2 (ADRB2), adrenergic receptor, a2c
(ADRA2C) and monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) (Figure 5e). These
genes were not significantly changed by epinephrine infusion. In
control hearts, apical ADBR2 level was 1.5-fold higher than that of
the basal. On the other hand, apical MAOA was half in comparison
with that of the basal.
DISCUSSION
In this study, echocardiographic measurements revealed that repeated
intravenous infusion with epinephrine in cynomolgus monkeys
induced LV dysfunction with apical ballooning and wall motion
abnormalities. To our knowledge, this is the first animal model
showing that repetitive injection of epinephrine overdose in a non￾human primate produced acute and reversible LV dysfunction,
namely, acute cardiomyopathy, which mimics that of takotsubo
cardiomyopathy in clinical cases. A form of LV systolic dysfunction
is characterized by extensive apical akinesia with normal or hypercon￾tractile baseline segments. Furthermore, EF fell below 40% in all the
cases. The dysfunction in this model exhibits both apical akinesis and
basal hypokinesis in the left ventricle in the acute phase, and
normalizes within 30 days after treatment with b-blockers or saline.
In other words, this LV dysfunction model was acute and reversible
cardiac disease. With regard to patients with takotsubo cardiomyo￾pathy, the following were reported:7–9,27,28 a reversible wall motion
abnormality, transient ST segment abnormalities on the ECG, minimal
evidence of epicardial coronary artery stenosis, vasospasm, distur￾bance of microcirculation, physical or emotional stress as a triggering
factor and minimal pathological evidence of acute myocarditis. Earlier
research has pointed to the direct toxic effect of catecholamine as a
possible cause of these cardiac diseases. The fact that takotsubo
cardiomyopathy is frequently preceded by physical or emotional stress
implies that activation of the sympathetic nervous system may some￾times be involved in the pathology of this disease.5,29 These clinical
features of takotsubo cardiomyopathy are closely similar to our model.
In this study, we measured only ECG by lead II and showed ECG
changes such as an increased T wave in the early stages after starting
epinephrine infusion, an elevated ST segment with a hyper act T wave,
an atrioventricular block and premature ventricular contraction, VT

results, VT and polymorphic VT, which are two of the most malignant
forms of ventricular arrhythmias, were observed in some cases unlike
clinical reports of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Sumitomo et al.

suddenly during or shortly after the first or second epinephrine
infusion. Some animals have been used as experimental models of
heart failure using excessive dosing of catecholamine. Two-week
subcutaneous epinephrine at 7.5 mg kg1 min1 infusion to a rat
resulted in cardiac injury such as left and right ventricle ischemic
lesion and fibrosis.20 Three repetitive applications (at 16-day intervals)
of high-dose epinephrine (4–5 mg kg1 min1) for 60 min induced
progressive LV dilatation and hypertrophy with a depressed LV systolic
function.21 Excess norepinephrine (4 mg kg1 min1) for 90 min
increased LV wall stress.22 Similar to these, earlier high-dose
catecholamine infusion models are only used to investigate the
mechanism of chronic or acute heart failure. Furthermore, impaired
cardiac performance in many animal models is irreversible. Therefore,
we conclude that this primate cardiac disease model is similar
to the model presenting takotsubo cardiomyopathy, although further
studies are needed to explain why mammals, with the exception of
primates, do not raise takotsubo-like cardiomyopathy by excess
catecholamine.
The mechanism underlying the association between takotsubo
cardiomyopathy and sympathetic stimulation is still unknown. Witt￾stein et al.
9 suggested that the cause of myocardial stunning (takotsubo
cardiomyopathy) from sudden emotional stress was because of ische￾mia resulting from epicardial coronary arterial spasm induced by an
increased sympathetic tone from mental stress. Furthermore, electro￾cardiographic findings such as ST-segment elevation have often been
presented in support of this conclusion. Kono et al.
31 reported that
clinical features in transient LV apical ballooning after subarachnoid
hemorrhage included increased local norepinephrine release in the
heart, and was mediated by the direct toxic effect of norepinephrine.
However, the reason for contractile abnormalities of the apex and
midportion of the left ventricle with relative sparing of the basal
segment still remains unclear.
As a part of the clinical treatment of takotsubo cardiomyopathy,
b-blocker,8,28,32 nitroglycerine,8,33,34 verapamil,33 aspirin8,32 and
heparin 8,33 were used. Several investigators35,36 reported that propra￾nolol, a b-blocker, may be very effective in patients who showed a
significant intraventricular pressure gradient because of the activation
of the sympathetic nerve. The efficacy of b-blockers may be attributed
to the improvement of b-adrenergic signaling and to protection from
catecholamine myocyte toxicity in the heart because of a severe
increase in plasma catecholamine and the activation of the sympa￾thetic nerve. In our results, metoprolol rapidly improved the decreased
contractile force of the left ventricle in spite of the single dose (Figures
3 and 4a). These results are consistent with the analysis of myocyto￾lysis by Luxol fast blue staining (Figure 4b). Marechaux et al.
37
reported on the case of a woman presenting with takotsubo-like
cardiomyopathy, subarachnoid hemorrhage and brain death. Histolo￾gical analysis of the heart confirmed the absence of myocardial
infarction and revealed only sparse foci of myocyte necrosis with
contraction bands in the akinetic areas. In this assay, no significant
change was observed among the three groups with regard to myo￾cytolysis at the basal portion. Epinephrine induced myocytolysis
randomly at the apical portion, which was ameliorated with meto￾prolol. Thus, a change in myocytolysis may contribute to a significant
improvement of the LV function.
The mechanism whereby epinephrine caused takotsubo-like
LV dysfunction and the manner in which b-blockers ameliorated
LV dysfunction in this study remain unclear. Therefore, we investi￾gated the effect of epinephrine and metoprolol in several gene
expression levels at the apical and basal portions. CTGF and OPN,
as well as ANP and BNP/NPPB are common diagnostic markers of
heart failure.38,39 In this study, epinephrine significantly increased
CTGF and OPN expressions at the apical portion, whereas
these expressions were not changed by epinephrine at the basal
portion (Figure 4a), indicating that epinephrine genes at the apical
portion may be more susceptible than those at the basal. Metoprolol
reduced the OPN expression, but did not affect CTGF.
Calcium malfunction plays a central role in heart failure. b-adreno￾ceptors increase intracellular cAMP levels and decrease the activity of
protein kinase A (PKA) by ADCY7.40 The downstream effect of
reduced PKA activity includes a reversal of desensitization and
internalization of b-adrenoceptors. Renin–angiotensin system plays a
crucial role in the development of cardiac hypertrophy and heart
failure under excessive b-adrenergic stimulation.41 In addition,
b-adrenoceptor blockers may improve energy balance in a failing
heart. Here, we investigated the effect of epinephrine and metoprolol
on calcium signaling-, renin–angiotensin system- and mitochondria￾related genes. Predictably, epinephrine significantly decreased RYR2
and SERCA2 expressions at the apical portion, and increased the
ADCY7 expression. These changes tended to improve with metopro￾lol. To compensate for the apical portion, SERCA2 expression at the
basal portion may be increased by epinephrine. At the apical portion,
AGTR1 mRNA was significantly reduced by epinephrine, whereas
AGTR2 was remarkably increased. Earlier data showed that LV AT1
and AT2 mRNAs were decreased in human heart failure,42,43 suggest￾ing that our study may be suitable as a heart failure model. Expres￾sions of PGC-1a, CYCS and TFAM, which are mitochondria-related
genes, were significantly repressed by epinephrine at the apical por￾tion. These data show that excess epinephrine reduces metabolic
energy because deterioration of these genes precipitated mitochondrial
abnormalities, myocyte apoptosis and heart failure.44 Taken together
with the earlier data showing that canine heart has a higher concen￾tration of b-adrenoceptors in the apical myocardium, with the
concentration gradient decreasing from apex to base,45 the apex
might be more sensitive than the basal myocardium to circulating
catecholamines.
In conclusion, repeated intravenous infusion of epinephrine over￾dose in anesthetized cynomolgus monkeys induced acute cardiomyo￾pathy, which is characterized by progressive left ventricle and
depressed systolic function, with severe hypokinesis in the apical
region and hyperkinesis in the basal region. Metoprolol improved
the decreased EF. Furthermore, epinephrine-induced changes of heart

failure-related gene expressions at the apical region were similar to
those in human heart failure. These results indicate that this model is
valuable in understanding the pathogenesis of takotsubo cardiomyo￾pathy associated with a hypersympathomimetic condition in a rele￾vant non-human primate model. Moreover, b-blockers may improve
cardiac contractile dysfunction in subjects with takotsubo cardiomyo￾pathy.
