Hepatitis E Virus in 
Pork Food Chain, 
United Kingdom, 
2009–2010
Alessandra Berto, Francesca Martelli, 
Sylvia Grierson, and Malcolm Banks
We investigated contamination by hepatitis E virus 
(HEV) in the pork production chain in the United Kingdom. 
We detected HEV in pig liver samples in a slaughterhouse, 
in surface samples from a processing plant, and in pork 
sausages and surface samples at point of sale. Our fi nd￾ings provide evidence for possible foodborne transmission 
of HEV during pork production.
During the past 10 years, hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection 
acquired in industrialized regions worldwide in the 
apparent absence of contaminated drinking water for fecal–
oral transmission has been reported (1). In Japan, foodborne 
transmission of HEV through ingestion of contaminated 
Sika deer, wild boar, and pig meat has been demonstrated 
(2) and, in France, after ingestion of pig liver sausage (3). 
Detection of HEV in pig liver sold in retail locations has been 
reported from Japan, the United States, and the Netherlands 
in 1.9%, 14.0%, and 6.5%, respectively (4,5). PCR indicated 
that 1 (1.3%) of 76 pig livers collected at retail outlets in 
southwestern England was positive for HEV (6).
The European Commission Framework Program 7 
project, Integrated Monitoring and Control of Foodborne 
Viruses in European Food Supply Chains, aimed to gather 
data on virus contamination of food and environmental 
sources for quantitative viral risk assessment and development 
of virus-specifi c guidance for food supply chain operators. 
The UK Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency 
investigated the pork food chain for HEV from slaughterhouse 
to point of sale. We investigated fecal contamination of pork 
and work surfaces during this study.
The Study
During September 2009–October 2010, we collected 
samples from slaughtered pigs, human hands, and 
the environment at perceived critical points for virus 
contamination in a pig slaughterhouse, a processing plant, 
and 3 points of retail sale. Food safety fact-fi nding visits 
were made to the premises during which, through direct 
observations of conditions and practices, more points 
were identifi ed where contamination with viruses possibly 
could occur and from where ad hoc surface samples were 
collected by using sterile gauze swabs and placed in in 
phosphate-buffered saline plus antimicrobial drugs.
We tested all samples collected by using real-time 
reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR) (7) for HEV. In 
addition, samples were tested for porcine adenovirus 
(PAdV) and human adenovirus by PCR as indicators of 
porcine and human fecal contamination, respectively. 
Nucleic acid extraction and rRT-PCR were performed 
according to standardized Integrated Monitoring and 
Control of Foodborne Viruses in European Food Supply 
Chains protocols. An extraction control virus, murine 
norovirus (MNoV), was placed in all samples before the 
lysis step of the extraction (8) to demonstrate the extraction 
of amplifi able nucleic acid. We performed all rRT-PCRs 
with an internal amplifi cation control (8).
At the slaughterhouse, 40 carcasses were selected. Ten 
carcasses were randomly selected from each of 4 groups 
of pigs slaughtered that day; each group corresponded to 
a different farm of origin. From each carcass, the visceral 
pack was removed and 2–3 g of liver and 8–10 g of feces 
were collected. Also, 10 swab samples were collected from 
the handlers and environment (Table 1).
At the processing plant, 10, 18, and 14 carcasses from 
3 slaughterhouses, representing 12 farms of origin, were 
randomly selected. The set of 14 carcasses came from the 
slaughterhouse we had visited, but for logistical reasons the 
carcasses were not the same as those that we sampled at 
the slaughterhouse. We collected 5 g of muscle from the 
ventral abdomen of each carcass. The extraction control 
MNoV was not detected in 2 of the samples, which we 
therefore excluded from the study, leaving 40 samples. 
Also, 10 surface swab samples were collected (Table 1).
At points of retail sale, 75 sausages were collected in 
11 batches from 3 locations representing 2 types of retail 
outlet (2 UK supermarket chains and 1 butcher). Sausages 
were collected on different days to ensure that they were 
from different batches of pigs. MNoV was not detected in 
12 of the samples, leaving 63 sausages for investigation. 
Eight surface swab samples were collected at point of sale 
(Table 1).
HEV RNA was detected at each of 3 sites in the 
pork food supply chain (Table 2). At the slaughterhouse, 
5 (13%) of 40 fecal samples, 1 (3%) of 40 livers, and 1 
(25%) of 4 swabs of workers’ hands were HEV positive. 
At the processing plant, each of 40 pig muscle samples was 
negative for HEV, and a surface swab from a metal point 
used to hook the carcasses was HEV positive. At points 
of sale, 6 (10%) of 63 sausages and 2 (25%) of 8 surface 
samples (knife and slicer swabs) were HEV positive. Five 
of the 6 positive sausages were in 1 of the 11 batches

collected. Control results showed no evidence of cross￾contamination in the laboratory.
The indicator of pig fecal contamination, PAdV, was 
detected at 2 of 3 sites (Table 2). Of 40 fecal samples, 39 
(98%) from the slaughterhouse were PAdV positive , as 
were 6 (15%) of 40 livers and 4 (40%) of 10 swab samples 
(knife swab immediately after evisceration, 2 hand swabs, 
and fl oor swab from area under which pigs were hung). At 
the processing plant, PAdV was not detected in any of the 40 
pig muscle samples or the 10 swab samples tested. At points 
of sale, PAdV was not detected in any of the 63 sausages 
tested, but 1 (13%) of the 8 swab samples from the door 
handle of the cold room was PAdV positive. This fi nding 
could have resulted from transfer from a contaminated pig 
carcass, but the in-test controls and method of sampling 
exclude this contamination as a source of the HEV in the 
sausage meat. Human adenovirus was not detected in any 
samples from any of the locations.
Conclusions
In industrialized regions, although the incidence of 
clinical hepatitis E in humans is low, the seroprevalence 
of antibodies against HEV is relatively high (9), 
indicating a high proportion of subclinical disease and/or 
underdiagnosis (10). A small proportion of this exposure 
to HEV is likely to result from travel to regions to which 
the virus is endemic or migration from such regions (11). 
However, a substantial level of exposure to HEV seems to 
have an indigenous source.
Pork products are eaten in several industrialized 
regions, including the United Kingdom (2,12,13). A recent 
cluster of illnesses in southern France was associated with 
ingestion of fi gatelli, a pig liver sausage mainly eaten raw 
(3). Foodborne illness has been associated with ingestion of 
pig liver and pig muscle tissue (14,15). Our study showed 
that in the United Kingdom, pork products with high￾volume nationwide consumption might be contaminated 
with HEV. We chose sausages as the type of point-of￾sale pork product investigated for HEV because they are 
widely eaten throughout the United Kingdom (>212,746 
tons in Great Britain during February 2011–February 2012, 
BPEX, Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board, 
UK), unlike pig liver, and a 10% HEV detection rate in 
pork sausages at point of sale could be a cause for concern.
In terms of the potential for virus transmission, the 
surface swabs provided evidence that PAdV and HEV 
contamination occurs in the slaughterhouse and at point of 
sale. From the processing plant, HEV was detected on 1 
surface swab. The 98% positive rate recorded for pig feces 
with the PAdV indicator validates this approach to detecting 
fecal contamination of porcine origin. No evidence of 
human fecal contamination was detected at any point in the 
chain, indicating that personal hygiene standards were high 
and that the HEV detected was unlikely to have come from 
human contamination of the samples.
Because the numbers of samples tested for viral 
contamination in this study were relatively small, these 
results should be taken as indicators only. For greater

In addition, we will assess the viability and genotype of 
HEV by further work of in vitro culture and nucleotide 
sequencing, respectively.
