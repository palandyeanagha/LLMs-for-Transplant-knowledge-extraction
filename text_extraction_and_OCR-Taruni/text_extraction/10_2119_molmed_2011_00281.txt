INTRODUCTION
Despite the great improvements in the
immunosuppression regimens used to
avoid allograft rejection (1–3), chronic re￾jection remains a major drawback for
long-term organ transplantation. In addi￾tion, the lifelong use of nonspecific im￾munosuppressants leads to high suscep￾tibility to infections (4), malignancies
(5,6) and cardio- (7) and nephrotoxicity
(8), which highly impairs the quality of
life in transplanted individuals. Thus, the
induction of immunological tolerance to
the allograft is desirable in the transplan￾tation field.
In recent years, researchers succeeded
in inducing allograft tolerance in several
experimental models (1,9–11); however,
little has been translated in benefits to
transplanted patients. Therefore, the de￾velopment of new approaches to trans￾late basic research in tolerance to the
clinic is required. Nevertheless, trans￾plantation tolerance does occur in the
clinic. A rare group of transplanted indi￾viduals manage to develop a state called
operational tolerance (OT), maintaining
normal graft function and an immuno￾competent immune system, after the
complete withdrawal of immunosup￾pressive drugs (12). The study of individ￾uals in OT may help to both understand
the mechanisms involved in human allo￾graft tolerance and determine biomark￾ers to discriminate this state among
transplanted individuals. Indeed, some
research groups, including ours, have
been evaluating a variety of immuno￾logic parameters in OT, mostly related to
T-cell activity (13–18).
Despite the importance of B-cell–
 mediated immunity in the context of
transplantation, there is limited informa￾tion on the profile of the B-cell compart￾ment in OT. It was reported that kidney￾transplanted OT individuals present
preserved numbers of total (19,20), naive
(20) and memory B cells (19,20) compared
with healthy individuals and a B-cell gene

Transplanted individuals in operational tolerance (OT) maintain long-term stable graft function after completely stopping im￾munosuppression. Understanding the mechanisms involved in OT can provide valuable information about pathways to human
transplantation tolerance. Here we report that operationally tolerant individuals display quantitative and functional preservation
of the B-cell compartment in renal transplantation. OT exhibited normal numbers of circulating total B cells, naive, memory and
regulatory B cells (Bregs) as well as preserved B-cell receptor repertoire, similar to healthy individuals. In addition, OT also displayed
conserved capacity to activate the cluster of differentiation 40 (CD40)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)
signaling pathway in Bregs, in contrast, with chronic rejection. Rather than expansion or higher activation, we show that the preser￾vation of the B-cell compartment favors OT.

higher expression of IGKV4-1, IGLLA and
IGKV1D-13 genes (20). However, the
functional implication of this B-cell gene
expression signature is unclear because
these genes, which code for immunoglob￾ulin light chains, have unknown im￾munoregulatory functions. Thus, despite
the current enthusiasm about the role of
B cells in OT, it is still unclear whether
they comprise relevant functional players
in this homeostatic state.
B cells are classically defined as
 antibody-producing cells; however, it is
well established that these cells display
several other functions, such as antigen
presentation and cytokine production
(21–25). Recently, some groups described,
in experimental models, B-cell subsets
that downregulate effector immune re￾sponses and help to control the develop￾ment of autoimmune disorders (26–29).
The suppressive activity of the so-called
suppressive regulatory B cells (Bregs) was
mostly related to the production of inter￾leukin (IL)-10 (29,30) and to direct contact
with CD4+ T cells in mice (27,28). In hu￾mans, there are two reports on B-cell sub￾populations displaying in vitro suppres￾sive activity (31,32). It should be pointed
that the immune phenotypic features of
Bregs in humans are still controversial,
and they are likely to be diverse, similarly
to regulatory T cells (33). One group of in￾vestigators calls them B10 cells, highlight￾ing their IL-10– dependent capacity to
suppress monocyte proinflammatory cy￾tokines (31). Another group defined a
human Breg subpopulation with the
CD19+
CD24hiCD38hi phenotype, bearing
suppressive activity also mediated by the
production of IL-10, by activation of the
cluster of differentiation 40 (CD40)/sig￾nal transducer and activator of transcrip￾tion 3 (STAT3) signaling pathway and by
engaging CD80 and CD86 (32). The im￾munoregulatory importance of the
CD40/STAT3 signaling pathway was
highlighted in the context of systemic
lupus erythematosus, where Bregs pre￾sented impaired suppressive function.
This impairment is probably related to the
inadequate IL-10 production on CD40 ac￾tivation, which is associated with low lev￾els of STAT3 phosphorylation (32).
Considering the variety of immuno -
regulatory pathways to homeostasis, we
hypothesized that the B-cell compart￾ment and regulatory B cells are func￾tional players in the state of OT. We
found that tolerant individuals displayed
a global preservation of the B-cell com￾partment and of the Breg activation sta￾tus, whereas chronic rejection individu￾als displayed a significant impairment of
Breg activation and B-cell numbers. We
conclude that, rather than overactivation,
the preservation of a healthy B-cell
 profile favors the development/ mainte￾nance of the homeostasis in OT.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Experimental Design
We compared the B-cell compartment
(circulating B-cell phenotypic characteri￾zation, B-cell receptor repertoire diver￾sity and the activation status of the
CD40/ STAT3 signaling pathway) in
(a) operational tolerance (OT, n = 5);
(b) stable graft function and standard im￾munosupression (Sta, n = 19); (c) chronic
rejection (CR, n = 13); and (d) healthy in￾dividuals (HI, n = 11). We also compared
the B-cell parameters globally among
groups.
Study Groups
The kidney graft recipients and
healthy kidney donors enrolled in this
study were followed at the Transplanta￾tion Unit of the Hospital das Clínicas,
Universidade de São Paulo, and the
Nephrology Unit of the Pontifícia Uni￾versidade Católica do Rio Grande do Sul,
both part of the Brazilian Multicenter
Study on Operational Tolerance, coordi￾nated at the Heart Institute, School of
Medicine, Universidade de São Paulo.
Blind analyses were performed for all
 experiments. The ethics committee of
both institutions approved this study
(CAPPESQ [Comissão de Ética para Pro￾jetos de Pesquisa] 0476/08). All study
subjects were recruited after obtaining
informed consent.
The individuals were grouped accord￾ing to the following classification: (a) OT:
Transplanted individuals with stable
graft function, in the absence of immuno￾suppression for at least 1 year (range
1.5–8 years); we have no biopsies of
these individuals because they had nor￾mal and stable graft function, and this
procedure is only clinically indicated
when deterioration of graft function
and/or proteinuria are observed (mean
serum creatinine level: 1.2 mg/dL);
(b) Stable graft function under conven￾tional immunosuppression: Trans￾planted individuals with stable graft
function, under standard immunosup￾pression (Azathioprine or mycopheno￾late mofetil/ sodium and/or steroids
and/or calcineurin inhibitor) and with￾out clinical and laboratory features sug￾gestive of rejection (mean serum creati￾nine level: 1.1 mg/dL); (c) Chronic
rejection: Transplanted individuals
under conventional immunosuppression
with high serum creatinine concentra￾tion and progressive renal function dete￾rioration. In all cases, chronic rejection
was confirmed by biopsy according to
Banff criteria (34,35) (mean serum creati￾nine level: 1.7 mg/ dL). Three individu￾als presented C4d intragraft deposition,
two of whom had circulating anti-human
leukocyte antigen (anti-HLA) non–donor￾specific antibodies. Two other individu￾als had anti-HLA antibodies without
C4d intragraft deposition, one of whom
presenting donor-specific HLA antibod￾734 | SILVA ET AL. | MOL MED 18:733-743, 2012

ies. The remaining five individuals were
classified as displaying cellular-medi￾ated rejection according to Banff criteria
(34,35); and (d) Healthy individuals:
healthy kidney donors with normal kid￾ney function (mean serum creatinine
level: 1.1 mg/dL).
Chronic rejection individuals dis￾played impaired renal function, assessed
by higher serum creatinine (Figure 1).
The demographic/clinical features of
subjects in the study groups are shown
in Table 1. We compared clinical parame￾ters among all study groups to check for
confounding factors and observed no
clear association of clinical/demographic
data (time after transplantation, age, sex
and so on) with the allograft outcome
and the immunologic results observed in
the different study groups (Fisher exact
test). We did not find statistical differ￾ences in the HLA sensitization among
the study groups; 3 of 5 OT, 4 of 10 CR,
7 of 19 Sta, and 5 of 10 HI had detectable
anti-HLA antibodies. Only two individu￾als (from Sta and CR groups) presented
donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies.
Selection Criteria
All transplanted individuals included
in this study had more than 1 year of
transplantation. Renal function was eval￾uated by the estimated glomerular filtra￾tion rate (eGFR) by using the Cockroft￾Gault formula (36), serum creatinine and
proteinuria. We considered “conserved”
or “stable” renal function when individ￾uals presented an eGFR ≥40 mL/min
and serum creatinine variation of ≤10%,
during the last 6 months before study
 enrollment.
Blood Samples and Peripheral Blood
Mononuclear Cell Isolation
Venous blood samples were collected
in heparinized vacutainers. Human pe￾ripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMCs) were isolated from blood by
 Ficoll-Hypaque (Pharmacia Biotech,
 Uppsala, Sweden) gradient centrifuga￾tion and then cryopreserved in a solution
of 90% fetal calf serum/10% dimethyl
sulfoxide in liquid nitrogen. For the sig￾naling experiments, PBMCs were de￾frosted in RPMI medium supplemented
with 10% of fetal calf serum (FCS). Cell
viability was routinely ≥85%.
B-Cell and B-Cell Subpopulation Flow
Cytometry Analysis
The PBMCs from renal transplanted
individuals and healthy volunteers were
incubated with allophycocyanin or phy￾coerythrin-cyanine dye 7 (PE-Cy7)-
 labeled anti-human CD19 (BD Bio￾sciences, San Jose, CA, USA), fluorescein
isothiocyanate–labeled anti-human CD24
(BD Biosciences) and phycoerythrin-
 cyanine dye 5 (PE-Cy5)-labeled anti￾human CD38 (BD Biosciences). The
FACS CantoIITM analyzer and DIVA soft￾ware (BD Biosciences) were used for cell
acquisition. At least 300,000 events were
acquired in the lymphocyte gate. The
data analysis was performed using the

FlowJo software 9.1 (Tree Star, Ashland,
OR, USA). We used the following classi￾fication to analyze the B-cell subpopu -
lations: CD19+ for total B cells, CD19+
CD24intCD38int for naive B cells,
CD19+
CD24hiCD38– for memory B cells
(37,38) and CD19+
CD24hiCD38hi for Bregs
(32). The absolute numbers of B cells and
subpopulations were calculated on the
basis of the total blood cell counts ob￾tained at the moment of blood collection
for this study.
B-Cell Receptor Repertoire Analysis
RNA was isolated from 5 × 106 PBMCs
using Trizol according to manufacturer’s
protocol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).
Total RNA was reverse-transcribed with
Superscript II reverse-transcriptase, using
oligo(dT)12–18 primers and random
primers (Invitrogen) in a final volume of
20 μL. cDNA was amplified in a standard
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) reaction
for 40 cycles with primers specific for the
seven variable heavy chain (VH) im￾munoglobulin (Ig) families (Table 2) and
with fluorescent reverse primers for the
IgM and IgG isotypes (Table 2). Some of
the primers were previously described in
the literature (39,40). The denatured PCR
products were then subjected to fragment
analysis on a 3730xl DNA Analyzer (Ap￾plied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).
CDR3 length profiles were obtained after
analysis with GeneMapper software (Ap￾plied Biosystems). The data was extracted
with GeneMapper software and submit￾ted to analysis at the ISEApeaks® soft￾ware, as described in the literature
(41,42). To calculate the representative￾ness of each CDR3 length in relation to
the total repertoire by using the ISEA￾peaks® software (42), for each VH ana￾lyzed, the software compared the area of
each peak with the sum of the areas of all
peaks expressed by each individual. We
calculated the relative index of stimula￾tion (43) by comparing the representa￾tiveness of each CDR3 length with the
mean representativeness obtained in the
HI group. We considered higher repre￾sentativeness of a CDR3 length when the
levels were ≥2 and lower representative￾ness when the levels were ≤0.5, in rela￾tion to levels observed in healthy individ￾uals. Taking the reported correlation
between the surface area of the peak and
the number of transcripts for the respec￾tive CDR3 length (39,44,45), we corre￾lated the expression levels of each CDR3
length with the peak area exhibited and
evaluated the occurrence of expansions
or decreases/deletions in the expression
of specific CDR3 lengths among groups.
B-Cell STAT3 Signaling After CD40
Stimulation
The activation of the CD40/STAT3 sig￾naling pathway was assessed as de￾scribed before (32). PBMCs were thawed
as mentioned above and allowed to rest
for 1 h in RPMI/10% FCS. Subsequently,
cells were washed with ice-cold PBS/1%
FCS and then centrifuged for 5 min at
500g in a prechilled centrifuge. Cells
were seeded in a 96-well round-bottom
plate at a concentration of 5 × 105 cells/
well. Cells were incubated on ice with 
5 μg/mL purified stimulatory mouse
anti-human CD40 monoclonal antibody
(mAb) (clone-5C3; BD Biosciences)
(0.5 μg CD40 mAb/106 cells) for 30 min
in the dark. Cells were then washed, as
described, and incubated with 10 μg/mL
goat anti-mouse Ig (BD Biosciences) for
30 min at 4°C. Cells were then stained
with appropriate antibodies for 30 min in
ice-cold PBS/1% FCS on ice. For stimula￾tion, cells were washed and resuspended
in 37°C warmed PBS/1% FCS and kept
at 37°C for 5 min. The reaction was
stopped by the addition of 37°C warmed
Cytofix™ (BD Biosciences). Cells were
left to fix and permeabilize in Cytofix™
for 30 min at 37°C. Cells were washed by
the addition of 50 μL Permwash™ (BD
Biosciences) and incubated with 200 μL
Permwash™ for 30 min on ice in the
dark. Cells were then centrifuged and in￾cubated with anti–pSTAT3-PE mAb
Phosflow antibody (pY705; BD Bio￾sciences) in Permwash™ for 30 min at
4°C in the dark. Cells were then washed
twice with Permwash™ and once with
PBS/2% FCS, and pSTAT3 expression
was measured by flow cytometry. The
fold of increase of STAT3 phosphoryla￾tion was calculated on the basis of the
ratio between the median fluorescence
intensity detected for stimulated and
nonstimulated PBMCs. The fold increase
in the number of pSTAT3-positive cells
was calculated by the ratio between the
percentages of pSTAT3-positive cells
after anti-CD40 stimulation and before it.
Analysis of Intracellular IL-10
Production by B Cells
For intracellular IL-10 analysis, B cells
were isolated from PBMCs of four
healthy individuals by magnetic separa￾tion (B-cell isolation kit II; Miltenyi
Biotec, Gladbach, Germany) (purity was
on average ≥90%). Purified B cells (4 ×
105
) were cultured in 96-well flat-bottom
plates in 0.2 mL medium (RPMI/10%
FCS) for 48 h. B cells were stimulated by

RESULTS
Operational Tolerance Displays
Preserved Numbers of B Cells, Naive
B cells and Bregs
We analyzed total B-cell numbers and
their subpopulations using the follow￾ing classification: CD19+ for total B cells
(Figure 2), CD19+
CD24intCD38int for
naive B cells, CD19+
CD24hiCD38– for
memory B cells and CD19+
CD24hiCD38hi
for Bregs, as described in Materials and
Methods (Figure 3A). CR individuals
presented a decrease in the percentage
and absolute numbers of circulating
B cells in relation to HI (p < 0.05) (Fig￾ures 2A, B), whereas OT individuals
presented preserved numbers of B cells
(see Figures 2A, B). The reduction in the
percentage of B cells in CR was fre￾quently accompanied by decreased fre￾quency of the Breg subpopulation,
whereas the other subpopulations re￾mained unchanged (Figures 3B, D, F).
Absolute numbers of B cells were also
lower in CR individuals who exhibited
lower numbers of circulating memory
B cells in relation to HI (p < 0.01) and
Bregs in relation to OT and HI (p < 0.05)
(Figures 3C, E, G).
OT Displays Preserved B-Cell Receptor
Diversity and Expansion of Specific
CDR3 Lengths
To analyze if the OT group exhibits
preferential use of the B-cell receptor
(BCR) repertoire, we used the immuno￾scope methodology, as described in the
literature (39). As shown in representa￾tive graphs for the IgM isotype (Fig￾ure 4A), the BCR repertoire was diverse
for the majority of the families for all
study groups. We first evaluated the di￾versity of the BCR repertoire by assess￾ing the number of different CDR3
lengths expressed in each of the 7 VH
immunoglobulin families (VH1–VH7),
for the IgM and IgG isotypes, for each
individual. The number of different
CDR3 lengths found for each individual
gives the complexity score (46). The
more diverse the BCR repertoire, the
higher the complexity score. CR dis￾played a lower BCR diversity for the
IgM isotype in relation to HI (p < 0.05)
(Figure 4B) and in relation to Sta and HI
for the IgG isotype (p < 0.01) (Figure 4C).
OT individuals showed BCR diversity
with no significant difference in relation
to both HI and Sta.
Looking for potential deletion or ex￾pansion of B-cell populations using
 specific CDR3 lengths, we used the
ISEApeaks® software (42) to calculate the
representativeness of each CDR3 length
of the whole repertoire. The OT group
displayed two CDR3 lengths differen￾tially expressed in relation to all study
groups. In the IgM isotype, the OT group
exhibited an overrepresentation of the
16–amino acid (aa) CDR3 length, in 
the VH3 Ig family, when compared with
CR (p < 0.01) and Sta/HI (p < 0.05) (Fig￾ure 4D). In addition, in the IgG isotype,
the OT group exhibited an overrepresen￾RESEARCH ARTICLE

tation of the 5-aa CDR3 length, in the
VH1 Ig family, when compared with 
all other study groups (p < 0.001) (Fig￾ure 4E). For all other CDR3 sizes, we de￾tected no statistical differences among
the groups.
Activation of CD40/STAT3 Signaling
Pathway in Bregs Is Preserved in OT
We evaluated whether the different
study groups displayed differences in the
IL-10 activation pathway by analyzing
the pattern of STAT3 phosphorylation
(pSTAT3) and the capacity to activate
this signaling pathway in the Bregs and
naive and memory B-cell subpopulations
upon CD40 engagement. In Figure 5A,
we illustrate representative histograms of
these analyses.
We performed two types of analysis.
In the first (Figures 5B–D), we evaluated
the intensity of STAT3 phosphorylation
poststimulus by calculating the increase
in the pSTAT3 fluorescence intensity
(median of fluorescence intensity). In the
second one, (Figures 5E–G), we analyzed
the capacity to activate the CD40/STAT3
pathway, by observing the capacity of
pSTAT3-negative cells to become positive
following anti-CD40 stimulation. This is
shown by the fold increase in the num￾ber of pSTAT3 after stimulus.
The CD40/STAT3 pathway activation
with the agonistic CD40 mAb in vitro ex￾hibited conserved and similar levels of
STAT3 phosphorylation for all study
groups, in all B-cell subpopulations (Fig￾ures 5B–D). Nevertheless, OT individuals
exhibited a higher capacity to generate
Bregs positive for pSTAT3 in relation to
CR (p < 0.05) and similar to HI individu￾als (Figure 5E). We did not observe any
differences among all groups in the fold
increase of pSTAT3+ after stimulation, for
the naive and memory B-cell subpopula￾tions (Figures 5F, G).
Finally, to confirm if Bregs present a
higher predisposition to produce IL-10,
as reported in the literature (32), we
stimulated purified B cells, in vitro, from
four healthy individuals with plate￾bound anti-CD40 plus sCD40L for 48 h
and evaluated intracellular IL-10 pro￾duction. Bregs displayed a higher per￾centage of IL-10–producing cells when
compared with memory and naive
B cells (Figures 5H, I).
DISCUSSION
In the recent years, a lot of effort has
been put forth to better understand the
multiple immunoregulatory pathways
potentially involved in the state of OT in
human transplantation. Although some
attention has been directed to the poten￾tial importance of the B-cell compart￾ment in the state of OT, the functional
implication of B cells for OT is not so
clear. We have attempted to tackle this
question using a global quantitative and
functional B-cell analysis. Kidney trans￾planted individuals in OT presented a
global preservation of the B-cell com￾partment parameters, regarding the per￾centage and the absolute numbers of
B cells, naive B cells and Bregs; the B-cell
receptor diversity; and the Breg activa￾tion status, all similar to the one ob￾served in healthy individuals. In addi￾tion, the OT group presented higher Ig
transcript levels or expansions of B cells

bearing B-cell receptors with 16 aa in the
VH3 Ig family (for the IgM isotype) and
5 aa in the VH1 Ig family (for the IgG
isotype), differentiating this group in re￾lation to all other study groups, includ￾ing healthy individuals. In contrast, the
CR group exhibited major quantitative
and qualitative alterations in the B-cell
compartment. These data allow us to
conclude that rather than inducing an
overactivation or augmentation of
B cells, the state of OT essentially in￾volves the capacity to preserve a healthy
B-cell compartment profile.
Our quantitative data corroborate pre￾vious works in which OT presented simi￾lar percentage and absolute numbers of
circulating B cells to HI individuals
(13,19,20), although the authors often
refer to the OT group as displaying in￾creased numbers of circulating B cells
(19). The state of OT does not seem to in￾duce a global expansion of total circulat￾ing B cells or any of their subpopula￾tions, but rather involves the quantitative
maintenance of B cells similar to that ob￾served in HI. This result could favor the
control of the inflammatory process di￾rected to the allograft or even just reflect
the achieved homeostatic state. In con￾trast, the drop in the numbers of circulat￾ing B cells could reflect the uncontrolled
ongoing inflammatory process in CR
 individuals.
One possible explanation for the de￾creased numbers of B cells in CR is the
recruitment of circulating B cells to the
graft. Indeed, it was reported that during
rejection, the kidney allografts express
chemokines (C-X-C motif chemokine 13
[CXCL13]) (47–49) and integrins (vascu￾lar cell adhesion molecule [VCAM] and
intracellular adhesion molecule [ICAM]-
1) (50), which could favor the recruit￾ment of circulating B cells to the graft
and induce a reduction of circulating
B cells, as we observed in CR. It could
also be argued that the immunosuppres￾sive drugs could affect the number of
B cells in the periphery. Although this re￾sult cannot be completely excluded, it
does not seem to be the case because the
Sta group, which is also under the same
immunosuppressive regimen, did not
show B-cell quantitative differences in re￾lation to the other groups. This scenario
suggests that other active processes are
likely to be involved in the reduction of
circulating B cells in CR.
Another interesting observation is that
the OT and HI groups exhibited similar
numbers of circulating B cells with the
regulatory phenotype CD19+
CD24hiCD38hi,
previously described in the literature
(32), whereas CR displayed an expressive
reduction of these cells. Thus, we may
interpret that the Breg population may
be an important regulator of the anti￾donor inflammatory immune response
and that Breg deficiency could be in￾volved in the process of chronic allograft
rejection.
In experimental models, Bregs have
been associated with the control of exac￾erbation/perpetuation of a variety of in￾flammatory responses (26–28,51). In hu￾mans, it was observed that these cells
suppress Th1 responses in vitro (32).
Nevertheless, there is still some contro￾versy in the scientific community as to
whether to consider these cells as “bona

fide” Bregs. Indeed, cells displaying the
CD19+
CD24hiCD38hi phenotype are not a
homogeneous subpopulation and may
include more than one type of B cell,
such as transitional B cells, as previously
described in the literature (38). In addi￾tion, other investigators have proposed
IL-10 production as the best phenotypic
marker for human Bregs, because of 
the difficulty in determining specific sur￾face markers for this B-cell subpopula￾tion (31). It should be mentioned that 
the IL-10–producing B cells, described 
in the cited work, exhibited some 
phenotypic differences in relation to

the CD19+ CD24hiCD38hi Bregs, such as
the expression of CD27, which is absent
in CD19+
CD24hiCD38hi Bregs (32,52).
This result suggests the existence of dif￾ferent suppressive B-cell subpopulations,
as well the establishment of regulatory
T cells (33). It is not presently known
whether different Breg subpopulations in
fact exist and if they could eventually
play differential roles in OT. Neverthe￾less, given our data, we suggest that the
state of OT has a systemic repercussion
and the maintenance of the Breg subpop￾ulation displaying the CD19+
CD24hiCD38hi
phenotype may, indeed, have an impor￾tant role in this homeostatic state.
In addition to the data on the numbers
of circulating B cells, we observed that
the CR group also exhibited reduced
B-cell receptor repertoire diversity in
PBMCs, whereas OT, Sta and HI pre￾sented similar BCR repertoire diversity.
These data reinforce the idea that an im￾balance in the B-cell compartment may,
indeed, be related to an impaired capac￾ity to control inflammation, favoring the
development of chronic rejection. In ad￾dition, the higher Ig transcript levels or
expansions of B cells expressing specific
BCR CDR3 lengths (16 aa in the VH3 Ig
family [IgM isotype] and 5 aa in the VH1
Ig family [IgG isotype]), in the OT group,
differentiated this state from all other
study groups, including HI individuals.
This result indicates that besides the
global quantitative preservation of the
B-cell compartment, the achievement
and/or maintenance of the OT involves a
differential expansion of particular B-cell
clones, bearing specific CDR3 lengths,
which could eventually contribute to tol￾erance. However, we do not have any
functional information on these cells ex￾pressing specific CDR3 lengths.
To evaluate whether the specific CDR3
lengths expanded in OT were contained
within the Breg population, we sorted
CD19+
CD24hiCD38hi and analyzed the
B-cell receptor repertoire (data not
shown). The B-cell receptor repertoire of
CD19+
CD24hiCD38hi cells was diverse and
included the CDR3 lengths expanded in
OT. However, the CD19+ CD24hiCD38hi
phenotype apparently showed no CDR3
length expansion (data not shown).
Therefore, we can say that the CDR3
lengths found to be expanded in OT are
indeed part of the CD19+ CD24hiCD38hi
Breg population. Unfortunately, there are
no VH family–specific antibodies avail￾able that could be used to purify these
cells and test their functional activity.
Nevertheless, we favor that the differen￾tial expression of these specific BCR
CDR3 lengths has a potential to be used
as biomarkers for OT, if confirmed in an￾other cohort of patients.
Another important observation is that
the Sta group exhibited individuals with
B-cell profiles similar to either CR or OT.
This result is noteworthy because this
group of individuals is a clinically rele￾vant target to search for potential OT in￾dividuals who could benefit from im￾munosuppression minimization. Thus,
the identification of individuals in the
Sta group with a B-cell profile similar to
OT could indicate a potential evolution
to OT, whereas a B-cell profile similar to
CR could suggest progression to chronic
rejection and loss of allograft function.
Looking for possible B-cell signaling
pathways involved in OT, we analyzed
the STAT3 phosphorylation pathway
upon CD40 engagement. We observed
that the OT and HI groups exhibited a
similar capacity to activate the Breg
STAT3 phosphorylation, whereas the CR
group displayed an impaired capacity to
activate this pathway. This Breg func￾tional alteration, together with the de￾creased numbers of circulating Bregs
seems to create a favorable context for
the development to chronic rejection. In
contrast, the preservation of a healthy
B-cell compartment profile, including
Breg numbers and functional activity, 
in OT, together with maintenance of
other immune system parameters de￾scribed in the literature, such as regula￾tory T cell (Treg) numbers (53,54), Toll￾like receptor 4 expression (55) and CD4
and CD8 T-cell numbers (13), probably
act synergically to compose a favorable
context for the development of trans￾plantation tolerance. We believe that the
experimental design we used, which in￾cluded a comparative analysis of OT
with its opposite clinical outcome
(chronic rejection), was critical for our
data interpretation.
One question that emerges from our
data on CD40/STAT3 signaling pathway
is whether OT individuals display a dif￾ferential profile for IL-10 production by
Bregs in relation to CR. Unfortunately,
because of technical problems involving
the appropriate CD40 stimulus for a pro￾longed culture experiment (48 h) and
limited biological material from OT indi￾viduals, we were unable to answer this
question. Nevertheless, we did find a
higher percentage of IL-10–producing
cells within the Breg population (see Fig￾ures 5H, I) in comparison to naive and
memory phenotypes in healthy individu￾als. However, only small percentages
(10–15%) of Bregs are IL-10 producers,
indicating that other mechanisms should
be involved in their suppressive activity.
Indeed, it was also reported that the reg￾ulatory activity mediated by these cells
also depends on cell contact mediated by
CD80/86 interactions (32). These are im￾portant issues to be investigated in the
context of OT.
We believe it is time to reexamine and
integrate all relevant immunologic data
available in the literature on OT at this
point. This step will allow us to have an
integrated global view of the various
mechanisms potentially involved in OT,
which may be relevant for the develop￾ment of new immunoregulatory strate￾gies. We propose that the B-cell profile
found in chronic rejection, combined
with other immunologic features ob￾served in this state, should be tested for
their predictive value regarding the pro￾gression to chronic rejection. If confirmed
to be predictive, they could be used as a
tool to identify potential chronic rejection
progressors that could benefit from addi￾tional immunosuppression and/or im￾munoregulatory stimuli.
CONCLUSION
It is important to highlight that OT in￾dividuals are quite rare worldwide. De￾RESEARCH ARTICLE

spite the limited numbers of OT individ￾uals in the present study, we clearly de￾fined a differential B-cell profile in rela￾tion to the CR group. We conclude that
OT induces a significant systemic reper￾cussion and that, rather than inducing ex￾pansion or higher activation, the preser￾vation of the B-cell compartment seems
to favor the achievement and/or mainte￾nance of transplantation homeostasis.
