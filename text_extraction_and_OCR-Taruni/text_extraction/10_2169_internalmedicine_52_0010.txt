Abstract
Objective Early diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is critical in the management of patients with
primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), since the prognosis of PBC has improved. The aim of this study was to in￾vestigate whether HCC development affects the prognosis of PBC and to identify the risk factors for HCC in
Japanese patients with PBC.
Methods We compared the survival rates between patients with HCC and those without and analyzed the
risk factors for HCC development in 210 patients with PBC who were followed up for a median period of
8.5 years.
Results HCC developed during follow-up in 11 patients (5.2%) and was diagnosed simultaneously at the
time of diagnosis of PBC in five patients (2.4%) who were excluded from the analysis. A Kaplan-Meier
analysis showed a significant difference in overall survival between the patients who did and did not develop
HCC (p<0.001). A multivariate analysis revealed age (OR: 1.08, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03-1.13, p=
0.001), the albumin level (OR: 0.24, 95% CI: 0.10-0.56, p=0.001), the total bilirubin level (OR: 1.60, 95%
CI: 1.09-2.36, p=0.017) and HCC development (OR: 2.97, 95% CI: 1.24-7.15, p=0.015) to be significant
prognostic factors and identified only an advanced histological stage (Scheuer’s classification III or IV, OR:
6.27, 95% CI: 1.80-21.83, p=0.004) to be a risk factor associated with HCC.
Conclusion HCC development significantly affects the survival of patients with PBC, and an advanced his￾tological stage is the only risk factor associated with HCC development. These results highlight the important
role of liver fibrosis in hepatocarcinogenesis in patients with PBC.

Introduction
Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is a progressive chole￾static liver disease characterized by the presence of highly
specific antimitochondrial antibodies, portal inflammation
and lymphocyte-dominated destruction of the intralobular
bile ducts that eventually leads to cirrhosis (1). The inci￾dence of PBC has increased over recent decades, possibly
attributable to augmented testing of liver biochemistry rather
than a rise in disease incidence. The routine use of bio￾chemical screening has also made it possible to diagnose
PBC at an earlier stage (2). In addition to early diagnosis,
the high prevalence of treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid
(UDCA) makes it possible for patients with PBC to live
longer. However, the natural history of PBC is still debated
and depends on several variables and symptoms of liver dis￾ease (3). In general, the risk of cancer development in￾creases as humans live longer, and the development of hepa￾tocellular carcinoma (HCC) is no exception.

Patients with PBC are considered to be at low risk for the
development of HCC (4), although several reports have re￾vealed that PBC is associated with an increased risk of
HCC (5-8). Additionally, whether the development of HCC
affects the overall survival of patients with PBC remains
controversial (5, 7, 9, 10). This matter and the identification
of risk factors for HCC development are of importance for
improving the prognosis of patients with PBC. There are,
however, few studies reporting the risk factors for HCC
among patients with PBC (5-7, 9, 11). The age at diagno￾sis (7, 11), male sex (5, 7, 10, 11), a history of blood trans￾fusions (7, 11), cigarette smoking (6), portal hyperten￾sion (11), a more advanced histologic stage of dis￾ease (9, 10) and superinfection with hepatitis C virus
(HCV) (6) have been reported to be risk factors for HCC in
patients with PBC. Such risk factors remain a matter of de￾bate due to recent changes in the nutritional environment
and/or lifestyle. For instance, previous studies did not in￾clude obesity or diabetes mellitus as clinical parameters for
assessing risk factors related to the development of HCC in
patients with PBC, even though these parameters have been
recognized to be risk factors for the development of
HCC (12, 13).
The aim of this study was to determine whether HCC de￾velopment affects the prognosis of PBC and to identify the
risk factors for HCC development in Japanese patients with
PBC based on recent clinical evidence.
Materials and Methods
This study was conducted among three series of patients
from three different liver disease centers who were treated
for a diagnosis of PBC between May 1984 and May 2010.
A total of 245 patients were recruited, including 116 pa￾tients from Kawasaki Medical School affiliated hospital, 72
patients from Yamaguchi Grand Medical Center and 57 pa￾tients from Kawasaki Hospital. The diagnosis of PBC was
established when the patient fulfilled at least one of the fol￾lowing criteria defined by the Intractable Hepato-Biliary
Disease Study Group of Japan: (i) laboratory abnormalities
consistent with chronic cholestatic liver disease and the
presence of chronic nonsuppurative destructive cholangitis,
(ii) positive antimitochondrial antibodies and a liver histol￾ogy compatible with PBC, (iii) a medical history and labo￾ratory abnormalities consistent with chronic cholestatic liver
disease and positive antimitochondrial antibodies. The histo￾logical stage was classified according to Scheuer’s classifi￾cation (14). The following 35 patients were excluded from
the analysis due to confounding risk factors for HCC or in￾complete clinical parameters: hepatitis B surface antigen
(HBsAg) positivity in two patients, anti-HCV antibody (anti￾HCV) positivity in five patients, a history of excessive alco￾hol consumption (>40 g/day) in four patients, a lack of
follow-up for more than 0.3 years in 12 patients and a lack
of pathological diagnosis in 12 patients (Fig. 1).
The diagnosis of diabetes mellitus was made based on a
history of antidiabetic medication use, including oral hypo￾glycemic agents and insulin, since the diagnostic criteria for
diabetes mellitus proposed by the Japan Diabetes Society
were not applied to all patients due to the lack of several
biochemical parameters. The diagnosis of portal hyperten￾sion was made based on the presence of esophageal or gas￾tric varices, ascites or splenomegaly. The clinical character￾istics at diagnosis of PBC are shown in Table 1. The pa￾tients were regularly assessed with biochemical tests every
one to four months and followed for a median period of 8.5
(range, 0.3-25.8) years. To determine the presence of HCC,
abdominal ultrasonography was performed in all patients
without HCC at intervals of four to 12 months. HCC was
diagnosed based on the findings of abdominal ultrasonogra￾phy and confirmed based on the findings of computed to￾mography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging, hepatic arteri-

Overall survival was defined as the period from the day
of PBC diagnosis until death, liver transplantation or the last
medical examination and compared between the patients
who did and did not develop HCC. Laboratory parameters
measured at the time of PBC diagnosis were compared to
those measured at the time of HCC diagnosis in patients
who developed HCC during the follow-up period. The study
protocol conformed to the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki
Declaration and was approved by the ethics committees of
the involved institutions.
Statistical analysis
Baseline continuous variables are expressed as the mean ±
SD. Comparisons between groups were made using the
Mann-Whitney test for continuous variables and the χ2 test
with Yates correction or Fisher’s exact test for categorical
variables. Cumulative survival was calculated using the
Kaplan-Meier method, and the differences among the groups
were analyzed with the log-rank test. Univariate and multi￾variate analyses of predictors of survival were performed us￾ing the Cox proportional hazards model. A multivariate
analysis of predictors for the development of HCC was per￾formed using the logistic regression test. A p value of less
than 0.05 was considered to be significant. All analyses de￾scribed above were performed using the SPSS software
package (version 11, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).
Results
Development of HCC in patients with PBC
Sixteen (7.6%) of the 210 patients with PBC developed
HCC. A diagnosis of HCC was made in 11 patients (5.2%)
during follow-up, whereas HCC and PBC were almost si￾multaneously diagnosed in the remaining five patients
(2.4%) who had diabetes mellitus and advanced histological
stages, except for a man aged 84 who was potentially at
high risk for HCC due to his age. These five patients (three
men and two women) were thereafter excluded from the
analysis. The clinical and histological features of the 11 pa￾tients who developed HCC during follow-up are summarized
in Table 2. The HCC incidence according to gender was
3.6% (1/28) in men and 5.6% (10/177) in women. The
mean interval between the diagnosis of PBC and the devel￾opment of HCC was 11.4±5.7 years. Antibodies to hepatitis
B core antigens (anti-HBc) were positive in two patients
(18.2%), negative in five patients (45.4%) and unknown in
four patients (36.4%), respectively. Six patients (54.5%) and
one patient (9.1%) had advanced histological stages (III) and
diabetes mellitus at the diagnosis of PBC, respectively. It
should be noted that the follow-up period until the develop￾ment of HCC was significantly longer in the patients with
mild histological stages (I or II) (14.8±4.1 years) than in
those with advanced histological stages (III) (8.5±5.5 years),
suggesting a potential risk for HCC development after a
long period of time even in patients with a mild histological
stage of PBC. Six patients had solitary tumors whose size
was less than 30 mm, except for one. These tumors were
treated with local ablation, such as percutaneous microwave
coagulation therapy, percutaneous ethanol injection or ra￾diofrequency ablation, transarterial chemoembolization
(TACE), combination of local ablation and TACE or liver
transplantation, in all patients, except one (case 9 in Ta￾ble 2) who could not be treated due to rupture of HCC.
To determine whether HCC develops as liver damage pro￾gresses, laboratory parameters (platelet count, alanine
aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST],
alkaline phosphatase, γ-glutamyltransferase, total bilirubin,
albumin and prothrombin time) were compared between the
two time points of PBC diagnosis and HCC diagnosis in the
11 patients. The serum albumin level, prothrombin activity
and platelet count were significantly lower at the time of
HCC diagnosis than at the time of PBC diagnosis, suggest￾ing that the development of HCC largely depends on the
progression of liver disease (Fig. 2). Patients with PBC who
developed HCC had significantly lower cumulative survival
rates than those who did not. The 5-, 10-, 15- and 20-year
cumulative survival rates of the PBC patients with HCC and
those without HCC were 91/98%, 61/87%, 51/83% and 10/
80%, respectively (p<0.001, Fig. 3).
Factors associated with survival in patients with
PBC
We next investigated the factors associated with survival
in patients with PBC in order to determine whether HCC
development actually affects the prognosis. In addition to
the baseline characteristics of the patients at the time of
PBC diagnosis, treatment with UDCA and the development
of HCC were incorporated into the parameters used to ana-

lyze the factors associated with the survival of patients with
PBC. However, we did not incorporate the response to treat￾ment with UDCA into these parameters due to a lack of es￾tablished biochemical criteria for the response to UDCA al￾lowing for prediction of the prognosis. Treatment with
UDCA (600 mg daily) was started within six months from
diagnosis of PBC in 186 patients (91%). The reason why
UDCA was not administered in the remaining 19 patients
was unknown. The duration of UDCA treatment was almost
the same as the follow-up period, since almost all of the pa￾tients continued taking UDCA due to a lack of moderate to
severe adverse effects.
A univariate analysis identified age, portal hypertension,
platelet count, AST, the total bilirubin and albumin levels,
prothrombin activity, advanced histological stage (Scheuer
criteria III or IV) and HCC development to be significant
predictors of survival in patients with PBC (Table 3).
Among these predictors, a multivariate analysis revealed age
(OR: 1.08, 95% CI: 1.03-1.13, p=0.001), the total bilirubin
(OR: 1.60, 95% CI: 1.09-2.36, p=0.017) and albumin levels
(OR: 0.24, 95% CI: 0.10-0.56, p=0.001) and HCC develop￾ment (OR: 2.97, 95% CI: 1.24-7.15, p=0.015) to be signifi￾cant factors associated with survival in patients with PBC
(Table 3).

Factors associated with the development of HCC in
patients with PBC
As the development of HCC has been demonstrated to be
significantly associated with survival in patients with PBC,
it is important to determine screening targets for HCC to
improve the prognosis for patients with PBC. In this study,
the patients with PBC who developed HCC had lower plate￾let counts (p=0.008), lower albumin levels ((p=0.02) and
more advanced histological stages of disease (Scheuer crite￾ria III or IV) (p=0.005) at the time of PBC diagnosis than
those who did not (Table 4). A multivariate analysis identi￾fied only an advanced histological stage (Scheuer criteria III
or IV) (OR: 6.27, 95% CI: 1.80-21.83, p=0.004) as being a
predictor of the development of HCC in patients with PBC
(Table 5).
Discussion
The frequency of HCC development in patients with PBC
is estimated to be around 3% (0.7-3.6%) according to recent
and relatively large cohort studies conducted in European
countries, the United States and Japan, although this fre￾quency increases as the histological stage pro￾gresses (5-10, 15, 16). In this study 5.2% of the patients
with PBC developed HCC during follow-up and 2.4% of the
patients had HCC simultaneously at the time of PBC diag￾nosis. The incidence of HCC was slightly higher in the pre￾sent study than that reported in previous studies; however, it
is unknown whether this difference is significant. The higher
incidence of HCC observed in the present study may be ex￾plained by the relatively longer period of follow-up in a re￾stricted number of institutions. Such situations potentially
include less drop out patients during the follow-up period.
HCC was demonstrated to develop as liver damage pro￾gressed in the patients with PBC, as indicated by significant
decreases in the serum albumin levels, prothrombin activity
and platelet counts at the time of HCC development. These
results are consistent with a previous observation of a Japa￾nese study group in which all patients had progressed to an
advanced histological stage (Scheuer criteria III or IV) by
the time of HCC development (7). We also found that HCC
development is a significant risk factor for survival in pa￾tients with PBC. Because the PBC patients had already pro￾gressed to an advanced histological stage at the time of
HCC diagnosis, these results appear to be reasonable and
are consistent with those of a study from Spain and Italy (9)
and a recent Japanese report based on a nationwide sur￾vey (10). In fact, the six PBC patients with HCC (6/9, 67%)
evaluated in the present study died of hepatic failure (Ta￾ble 2). In some of the patients with HCC, it was difficult to
determine whether the cause of death was hepatic failure or
HCC. Therefore, deaths resulting from progressive hepatic
failure related to portal venous invasion or rupture of HCC
were defined as deaths caused by HCC. Deaths resulting
from progressive hepatic failure during the course of treat￾ment for HCC without portal venous invasion were defined
as deaths caused by hepatic failure.
In contrast to PBC, HCC development (n=19) was not
found to be a significant risk factor for survival in patients
with alcoholic liver cirrhosis (n=103) who were followed
during almost the same period as those followed in this
study and who developed hepatic failure within a relatively
short period of time unless they stopped drinking alcohol
(unpublished data). The long-term clinical course of PBC
may also account for the association between HCC develop￾ment and a poor prognosis in patients with PBC. In addition
to HCC development, age, the albumin level and the total
bilirubin level at onset of PBC were selected as significant
prognostic factors in patients with PBC in the present study.
These results are in part consistent and in part inconsistent
with those of previous studies (7, 17), most likely due to the
different backgrounds of the patients studied.
That the majority (90%) of patients were treated with
UDCA may account for why we did not find any differ￾ences in survival between the treated patients and the un￾treated patients. However, a limitation of this study is that
the response to treatment with UDCA could not be incorpo￾rated into the analytic factors for survival. The response to
UDCA has been reported to be associated with a better
prognosis among PBC patients with moderately advanced
disease compared with patients with mild disease (18), who
accounted for the majority (80%) of the patients in the pres￾ent study. Recent biochemical criteria for predicting the out￾comes of patients with early PBC at low risk for long-term
development of liver cirrhosis (19) may be useful for assess￾ing whether the response to UDCA treatment affected the

hepatitis B or alcoholic cirrhosis (20, 21). However, these
previous studies did not include diabetes mellitus as a clini￾cal parameter for assessing risk factors related to the devel￾opment of HCC in patients with PBC (5-7, 9-11). We did
not find any associations between diabetes mellitus and the
development of HCC, although the proportion of patients
with diabetes mellitus (9%) in this study was relatively
small. Although a link between insulin resistance and meta￾bolic hepatocarcinogenesis has been reported (22), the con￾tribution of diabetes mellitus to the development of HCC in
patients with chronic liver diseases may vary according to
the etiology of liver disease.
We did not identify male sex to be a significant factor as￾sociated with HCC development in patients with PBC,
which is inconsistent with the results of some previous stud￾ies (5, 7, 10, 11). In particular, the discrepancy between the
present study and a recent Japanese nationwide study (10)
may be explained by at least three factors. First, the patient
sample size was much smaller in this study than in the na￾tionwide survey. Second, the present study included more
patients with an advanced histological stage of disease
(Scheuer criteria III or IV) (18%) than the nationwide sur￾vey (12%), although other clinical parameters, such as age,
gender and the frequency of treatment with UDCA, were
similar between the two studies. Third, the exclusion crite￾rion regarding a history of excessive alcohol consumption
(>40 g/day) employed in this study may be associated with
this discrepancy since the nationwide survey did not clearly

exclude patients with a history of excessive alcohol con￾sumption. As shown in a previous study (9), we also found
only an advanced histological stage (Scheuer’s classification
III or IV) to be a risk factor associated with the develop￾ment of HCC in patients with PBC. Considering that cho￾langiocytes, not hepatocytes, are primarily affected and liver
fibrosis progresses as the histological stage advances in
PBC, these results indeed highlight the important role of
liver fibrosis in hepatocarcinogenesis in patients with PBC.
In addition, it should be noted that the follow-up period un￾til the development of HCC was significantly longer in the
patients with a mild histological stage (I or II) than in those
with an advanced histological stage (III or IV). These results
suggest a potential risk for HCC development after a long
period of time, even in PBC patients with a mild histologi￾cal stage of disease at the time of diagnosis.
In conclusion, the development of HCC has been demon￾strated to affect the survival of Japanese patients with PBC.
Considering that the prognosis of PBC has improved in gen￾eral as a result of early diagnosis and the use of UDCA, the
early diagnosis of HCC is also crucial for obtaining a better
prognosis for patients with PBC. Therefore, strict surveil￾lance for HCC is necessary among patients with PBC who
are in the advanced stage of disease.
