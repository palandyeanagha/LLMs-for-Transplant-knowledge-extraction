Abstract
The full guideline for the management of non-tuberculous 
mycobacterial pulmonary disease is published in Thorax. 
The following is a summary of the recommendations 
and good practice points. The sections referred to in the 
summary refer to the full guideline. 
Introduction
The full guideline for the management of 
non-tuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary 
disease (NTM-PD) is published in Thorax.
1
 The 
key features of the guideline are highlighted in 
a short article published to accompany the full 
guideline.2
 The following is a summary of the 
recommendations and good practice points. 
The sections referred to in the summary refer 
to the full guideline.
Background
Since the publication of the British Thoracic 
Society (BTS) Guideline on the ‘Management 
of opportunistic mycobacterial infections’3
 in 
2000, our understanding of the epidemiology, 
microbiology and management of NTM-PD 
has advanced. The incidence and prevalence 
of NTM-PD is increasing and is most likely 
explained by improved clinician awareness 
and enhanced detection methods, as well as a 
variety of changing environmental, mycobacte￾rial and host factors. Technological advances 
in molecular microbiology have revolutionised 
our understanding of NTM taxonomy and it is 
now appreciated that species and subspecies 
often differ in their pathogenicity and treat￾ment response. While there remains a dearth 
of contemporary randomised controlled trial 
data to inform practice, the Guideline Devel￾opment Group have sought to combine the 
best available evidence with clinical experience 
to create a pragmatic management guideline.
Target audience for the guideline
This guideline is aimed at healthcare practi￾tioners who are involved in the care of individ￾uals with NTM-PD, which will include hospital 
specialists in respiratory medicine, infectious 
diseases, paediatrics, microbiology, immu￾nology and radiology.
Groups covered within the guideline 
include: (a) individuals without pre-existing 
lung disease (de novo NTM infection); (b) 
individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease and other chronic inflammatory lung 
diseases; (c) individuals with bronchiectasis; 
(d) individuals with cystic fibrosis; (e) individ￾uals with a primary or secondary immunode￾ficiency; (f) individuals being considered for 
and following lung transplantation. Groups 
not covered within the guideline are patients 
with extrapulmonary NTM disease, neonates 
(birth to 28 days), infants (1–12 months), and 
patients with HIV infection.
Scope of the guideline
1. Epidemiology—incidence, prevalence 
and risk factors
2. Microbiology—types of samples, detection 
and speciation
3. Definition of NTM-PD and indications for 
treatment
4. Antibiotic treatment regimens for specific 
NTM species
5. Role of drug susceptibility testing
6. Non-antibiotic treatment—interfer￾on-gamma, Mycobacterium vaccae

Methodology
This guideline is based on the best available evidence. The 
methodology used to write the guideline adheres strictly to 
the criteria as set by the AGREE (Appraisal of Guidelines 
for Research and Evaluation) collaboration, which is avail￾able online www.agreetrust.org/resource-centre/agree-ii/. 
The BTS Standards of Care Committee guideline produc￾tion manual is available at http://www.brit-thoracic.org.
uk/guidelines-and-quality-standards/.
Clinical questions, literature search and appraisal of the 
literature
Clinical questions were structured in the Population,
Intervention, Comparison, Outcome format (see online 
appendix 1 in the full guideline), to define the scope of 
the guideline and inform the literature search.
The searches were first run in November 2012 and 
updated in June 2015 (see full guideline online appendix 
1).
Appraisal was performed to be compliant with the 
AGREE collaboration. Please see the full guideline for 
further details.
Considered judgement and grading of evidence
The Guideline Development Group used the evidence 
tables (see full guideline online appendix 2) to judge 
the body of evidence and grade recommendations for 
this guideline (tables 1 and 2). Where evidence was 
lacking to answer the formulated clinical questions, 
expert opinions were obtained through consensus. 
The following were considered in grading of the 
recommendations:
► The available volume of the body of evidence.
Table 1 Key to evidence statements
Grade Evidence
1++ High-quality meta-analyses, systematic reviews of RCTs or RCTs with a very low risk of bias
1+ Well-conducted meta-analyses, systematic reviews of RCTs or RCTs with a low risk of bias

► How applicable the obtained evidence was in making 
recommendations for the defined target audience of 
this guideline.
► Whether the evidence was generalisable to the target 
population for the guideline.
► Whether there was a clear consistency in the evidence 
obtained to support recommendations.
► What the implications of recommendations would be 
on clinical practice in terms of resources and skilled 
expertise.
► Cost-effectiveness was not reviewed in detail as in￾depth economic analysis of recommendations falls 
beyond the scope of this guideline.
Recommendations were graded from A to D as indicated 
by the strength of the evidence as shown in table 2. In line 
with the Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network (SIGN) 
guidance, ‘minus’ evidence was considered in context 
but in the absence of other ‘plus’ supporting evidence, it 
was discussed among the Guideline Development Group 
regarding that point and any recommendation hence 
made was grade D. Important practical points lacking any 
research evidence, nor likely to be research evidence in the 
future were highlighted as ‘good practice points’.
Drafting the guideline
The Guideline Development Group corresponded regu￾larly by email and meetings of the full group were held in 
May and July 2012, July and September 2013, January, April 
and November 2014 and June 2015 as well as a number of 
teleconferences. The Guideline Development Group were 
asked if they agreed or disagreed with the draft recommen￾dations and good practice points in an anonymous elec￾tronic survey administered by the BTS project co-ordinator 
in Spring 2016. The Guideline Development Group had 
agreed at the start of the guideline development process 
that 80% or more agreement would be the threshold 
for acceptance. Although not always unanimous, 80% or 
greater agreement was achieved for all recommendations 
and good practice points in the first round of voting.
The BTS Standards of Care Committee (SOCC) 
reviewed the draft guideline in November 2016. The 
draft guideline was made available online in February 
2017 for public consultation and circulated to all the 
relevant stakeholders. The BTS SOCC rereviewed the 
revised draft guideline in June 2017 and final SOCC 
approval for publication was granted in July 2017.
This BTS Guideline will be reviewed within 5 years 
from publication date.
Summary of recommendations and good practice 
points
Section 4: What is the evidence for transmission of NTM 
between individuals?
Recommendation
► Adequate infection control policies need to be im￾plemented in both inpatient and outpatient settings 
to minimise risks of person-to-person transmission of 
Mycobacterium abscessus in individuals with cystic fibro￾sis (grade B).
Section 5: How should the lung disease attributable to NTM 
infection be defined?
Recommendation
► In the absence of robust evidence to support an alter￾native definition and due to the clinical and research 
benefits of having a uniform definition, use of the 
American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Soci￾ety of America (ATS/IDSA) 2007 definition of NTM￾PD is recommended (box 1) (grade D).
Good practice point
✔ The management of coexisting lung conditions/in￾fectionsshould be optimised before ascribing clinical 
decline to NTM-PD.
Section 6: What samples should be used to detect pulmonary 
non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection?
Recommendations
► Sputum, induced sputum, bronchial washings, bron￾choalveolar lavage or transbronchial biopsy samples 
can be used to evaluate individuals suspected to have 
NTM-PD (grade D).
Box 1 Clinical and microbiological criteria for diagnosing 
non-tuberculous mycobacterial lung disease (modified with 
permission from reference 4
)
Clinical (both required)
1. Pulmonary symptoms, nodular or cavitary opacities on chest 
radiograph, or a high-resolution computed tomography scan that 
shows multifocal bronchiectasis with multiple small nodules. 
and
2. Appropriate exclusion of other diagnoses.
Microbiological
1. Positive culture results from at least two separate expectorated 
sputum samples. If the results are non-diagnostic, consider repeat 
sputum AFB smears and cultures. 
or
2. Positive culture result from at least one bronchial wash or lavage. 
or
3. Transbronchial or other lung biopsy with mycobacterial 
histopathological features (granulomatous inflammation or AFB) 
and positive culture for NTM or biopsy showing mycobacterial 
histopathologic features (granulomatous inflammation or AFB) 
and one or more sputum or bronchial washings that are culture 
positive for NTM.
AFB, acid-fast bacilli; NTM, non-tuberculous mycobacteria.

Open Access
► Whenever possible, less invasive sampling should be 
attempted first to minimise procedural risks (grade 
D).
► Respiratory samples should be processed within 
24hours of collection (or refrigerated at 4°C if delays 
are anticipated) (grade D).
► Oropharyngeal swab culture or serology testing 
should not be used to diagnose NTM-PD (grade D).
Good practice points
✔ Respiratory specimens should be collected with ap￾propriate infection control precautions, including 
personal protective equipment, given the frequent 
differential diagnosis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in￾fection.
✔ If sputum cultures are negative but clinical suspicion 
of NTM infection is high, consider performing CT-di￾rected bronchial washings to obtain targeted samples.
✔ If individuals undergoing diagnostic evaluation for 
NTM infection are taking antibiotics that may impair 
NTM growth (such as aminoglycosides, macrolides, 
tetracyclines, cotrimoxazole, linezolid), consider dis￾continuing these antibiotics 2weeks prior to collect￾ing samples.
Section 7: What microbiological tests should be used to 
detect NTM in respiratory samples?
Recommendations
► A validated rapid method should be used to detect 
NTM in respiratory samples (grade D).
► All respiratory samples should be stained using au￾ramine-phenol after liquefaction and concentration 
and then examined by microscopy (grade B).
► Respiratory tract samples should be cultured (follow￾ing decontamination) on solid and liquid media in a 
ISO15189 accredited clinical laboratory for 8 weeks 
extending to 12 weeks if necessary (grade D).
► Routine use of non-culture-based detection methods 
is not recommended at the present time (grade D).
Good practice point
✔ If there is high clinical suspicion of NTM infection 
but negative sample cultures, consider discussing 
with a mycobacterial reference laboratory about 
(i) the possibility of culture on alternative media, 
at different temperatures, and/or for extended 
durations or (ii) the utility of molecular detection 
methods.
Section 8: What microbiological tests should be used to 
speciate and type NTM from respiratory samples?
Recommendations
► All NTM isolates from respiratory samples should be 
identified to at least species level using validated mo￾lecular or mass spectrometry techniques (grade B).
► Isolates of M. abscessus should be subspeciated using 
appropriate molecular techniques (grade C).
► If person-to-person transmission of M. abscessus is 
suspected, isolates should be typed, preferably using 
whole genome sequencing (grade C).
Section 9: Does in vitro drug susceptibility testing predict 
response to antibiotic treatment in people with NTM 
pulmonary infection?
Recommendations
► Drug susceptibility testing and reporting should fol￾low the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute guide￾lines (grade D).
► For Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), clarithro￾mycin and amikacin susceptibility testing should be 
performed on an isolate taken prior to initiation of 
treatment and on subsequent isolates if the patient 
fails to respond to treatment or recultures MAC after 
culture conversion (grade C).
► Macrolide-resistant MAC isolates should be tested 
against a wider panel of antibiotics to guide, but not 
dictate, treatment regimens (grade D).
► For Mycobacterium kansasii, rifampicin susceptibility 
testing should be performed on an isolate prior to 
initiation of treatment and on subsequent isolates if 
the patient fails to respond to treatment or recultures 
M. kansasii after culture conversion (grade D).
► Rifampicin-resistant M. kansasii isolates should be 
tested against a wider panel of antibiotics to guide, 
but not dictate, treatment regimens (grade D).
► Susceptibility testing for M. abscessus should include 
at least clarithromycin, cefoxitin and amikacin (and 
preferably also tigecycline, imipenem, minocycline, 
doxycycline, moxifloxacin, linezolid, cotrimoxazole 
and clofazimine if a validated method is available) to 
guide, but not dictate, treatment regimens (grade D).
Good practice points
✔ Susceptibility testing should only be carried out on 
isolates where there is clinical suspicion of disease 
(to avoid unnecessary cost and conserve laboratory 
resources).
✔ Reporting of minimum inhibitory concentration 
(MIC) and critical concentration rather than suscep￾tible or resistant may be more appropriate in the be￾lief that a drug that has a very high MIC is unlikely 
to be active in vivo, whereas one just above a putative 
‘critical concentration’ may have some activity, espe￾cially if combined with additive or synergistic agents.
Section 10: What investigations should be performed in 
patients suspected of having NTM-PD? (see figure 1)
Respiratory tract cultures
Recommendations
► A minimum of two sputum samples collected on sep￾arate days should be sent for mycobacterial culture 
when investigating an individual suspected of having 
NTM-PD (grade D) (see figure 1).

Figure 1 A suggested algorithm for the investigation of individuals with clinical suspicion of NTM-PD. AFB, acid-fast bacilli; 
HRCT, high-resolution CT; NTM-PD, non-tuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease.
► Individuals suspected of having NTM-PD whose 
sputum samples are consistently culture negative 
for mycobacteria should have CT-directed bron￾chial washings sent for mycobacterial culture 
(grade D).
► Individuals suspected of having NTM-PD who are un￾able to expectorate sputum should have CT-directed 
bronchial washings sent for mycobacterial culture 
(grade D).
► Transbronchial biopsies should not be performed 
routinely in individuals suspected of having NTM-PD 
(grade D).
Good practice points
✔ Sputum induction resulting in a positive culture may 
avoid the need for CT-directed bronchial washings in 
individuals who are unable to spontaneously expecto￾rate sputum.
✔ Sputum induction should be considered in individ￾uals suspected of having NTM-PD who are unable 
to spontaneously expectorate sputum and in whom 
CT-directed bronchial washings are considered inap￾propriate
Radiology
Recommendations
► A chest X-ray should be performed in individuals sus￾pected of having NTM-PD (grade D).
► A CT scan should be performed in individuals sus￾pected of having NTM-PD (grade D).
Other investigations
Recommendations
► There is insufficient evidence to recommend 
the routine use of serological testing for diagno￾sis and monitoring of individuals with NTM-PD 
(grade D).
► Positron emission scanning, skin testing and interfer￾on-gamma release assays should not be used in the 
evaluation of individuals suspected of having NTM￾PD (grade D).
Section 11: What factors influence when NTM treatment 
should be started?
Recommendations
► The decision to start treatment should be influenced 
by the severity of NTM-PD, the risk of progressive

NTM-PD, the presence of comorbidity and the goals 
of treatment (grade D).
► Individuals may require a period of longitudinal as￾sessment (symptoms, radiological change and myco￾bacterial culture results) to inform NTM treatment 
decisions (grade D).
Good practice point
✔ The views of the affected individual should be sought 
on the potential risks and benefits of starting NTM

Section 12a: What antibiotic regimen should be used to treat 
MAC-PD?
Recommendations
► Clarithromycin-sensitive MAC-PD should be treated 
with rifampicin, ethambutol and clarithromycin or

► An injectable aminoglycoside (amikacin or strepto￾mycin) should be considered in individuals with se￾vere MAC-PD (as defined in table 3) (grade D).
► Clarithromycin-resistant MAC-PD should be treat￾ed with rifampicin, ethambutol and isoniazid or a 
quinolone, and consider an injectable aminoglyco￾side (amikacin or streptomycin) (grade D).
► Nebulised amikacin may be considered in place of 
an injectable aminoglycoside when intravenous/in￾tramuscular administration is impractical, contrain￾dicated or long-term treatment with an aminoglyco￾side is required for the treatment of MAC-PD (grade 
D).
► Macrolide monotherapy or macrolide/quinolonedual 
therapy regimens should not be used for the treat￾ment of MAC-PD (grade D).
► Antibiotic treatment for MAC-PD should continue 
for a minimum of 12 months after culture conversion 
(grade D).
Good practice points
✔ Individuals with clarithromycin-resistant MAC-PD 
should be managed in collaboration with a physician 
experienced in managing NTM-PD.
✔ Individuals with a history of treatment intolerance or 
treatment failure should be managed in collaboration 
with a physician experienced in managing NTM-PD.

with a three-drug regimen guided, but not dictated 
by, drug susceptibility test results using a daily oral 
regimen (grade D).
► Antibiotic treatment for M. kansasii-PD should con￾tinue for a minimum of 12 months after culture con￾version (grade D).
Good practice points
✔ Individuals with rifampicin-resistant M. kansasii-PD 
should be managed in collaboration with a physician 
experienced in managing NTM-PD.
✔ Individuals with a history of treatment intolerance 
or treatment failure should be managed in collab￾oration with a physician experienced in managing 
NTM-PD.
Section 12c: What antibiotic regimen should be used to treat 
Mycobacterium malmoense-PD?
Recommendations
► M.malmoense-PD should be treated with rifampicin, 
ethambutol and a macrolide (clarithromycin or azith￾romycin) using a daily oral regimen (grade D). (see 
Table 5)
► An injectable aminoglycoside (amikacin or strep￾tomycin) should be considered in individuals with 
severe M. malmoense-PD (ie, AFB smear positive res￾piratory tract samples, radiological evidence of lung 
cavitation/severe infection or severe symptoms/signs 
of systemic illness) (grade D).
► Nebulised amikacin may be considered in place of an

► Antibiotic treatment for M. malmoense-PD should con￾tinue for a minimum of 12 months after culture con￾version (grade D).
Good practice points
✔ Individuals with a history of treatment intolerance 
or treatment failure should be managed in collab￾oration with a physician experienced in managing 
NTM-PD.
Section 12d: What antibiotic regimen should be used to treat 
M. xenopi-PD?
Recommendations
► M. xenopi-PD should be treated with a four-drug reg￾imen (where tolerated) comprising rifampicin, eth￾ambutol and a macrolide (clarithromycin or azith￾romycin), with either a quinolone (ciprofloxacin or 
moxifloxacin) or isoniazid (grade D) (see table 6) .
► An injectable aminoglycoside (amikacin or strep￾tomycin) should be considered in individuals with 
severe M. xenopi-PD (ie, AFB smear positive respira￾tory tract samples, radiological evidence of lung cav￾itation/severeinfection or severe symptoms/signs of 
systemic illness) (grade D).
► Nebulised amikacin may be considered in place of an 
injectable aminoglycoside when intravenous/intra￾muscular administration is impractical, contraindicat￾ed or long-term treatment with an aminoglycoside is 
required in the treatment of M. xenopi-PD (grade D).
► Antibiotic treatment for M. xenopi-PD should contin￾ue for a minimum of 12 months after culture conver￾sion (grade D).
Good practice points
✔ Individuals with a history of treatment intolerance or 
treatment failure should be managed in collaboration 
with a physician experienced in managing NTM-PD.
Section 12e: What antibiotic regimen should be used to treat 
M. abscessus-PD?
Recommendations
► M. abscessus-PD treatment should comprise an initial 
phase antibiotic regimen (including intravenous and 
oral antibiotics) followed by a continuation phase an￾tibiotic regimen (including inhaled and/ororal anti￾biotics) (grade D).
Initial phase
► For individuals with M. abscessus isolates that are clar￾ithromycin sensitive or demonstrate inducible mac￾rolide resistance (see tables 7 and 8), the initial phase 
antibiotic regimen should include at least a 4-week 
course of intravenous amikacin, intravenous tigecy￾cline and (where tolerated) intravenous imipenem, 
and (where tolerated) oral clarithromycin or oral 
azithromycin (grade D).
► For individuals with M. abscessus complex isolates that 
demonstrate constitutive macrolide resistance (see 
tables 7 and 8), the initial phase antibiotic regimen 
should include a minimum 4-week course of intrave￾nous amikacin, intravenous tigecycline and (where 
tolerated) intravenous imipenem (grade D).
► The duration of intravenous treatment should be 
influenced by the severity of infection, treatment re￾sponse and tolerance of the regimen (grade D).

*Due to the poorer response rates in patients with inducible or constitutive macrolide-resistant isolates and the greater efficacy of antibiotics 
administered through the intravenous route, -extending the duration of intravenous antibiotic therapy to 3–6 months in those that can tolerate 
it may be the most appropriate treatment strategy in this subgroup of patients.
†Substitute intravenous/nebulisedamikacin with an alternative antibiotic if the M. abscessus is resistant to amikacin (ie, MIC >64mg/L or 
known to have a 16S rRNA gene mutation conferring constitutive amikacin resistance).

Box 2 Definitions for microbiological outcomes
► Culture conversion: three consecutive negative mycobacterial 
sputum cultures collected over a minimum of 3months, with the 
time of conversion being the date of the first of the three negative 
mycobacterial cultures. In patients unable to expectorate sputum, 
a single negative mycobacterial culture of a CT-directed bronchial 
wash is indicative of culture conversion.
► Recurrence: two positive mycobacterial cultures following culture 
conversion. If available, genotyping may help distinguish relapse 
from reinfection.
► Refractory disease: failure to culture convert after 12 months of 
non-tuberculous mycobacterial treatment.
ment with an aminoglycoside is required in individu￾als with M. abscessus-PD (grade D).
► In the context of amikacin-resistant M. abscessus (ie, 
MIC >64mg/L or the isolate is known to have a 16S 
rRNA gene mutation conferring constitutive ami￾kacin resistance), intravenous/nebulisedamikacin 
should be substituted with an alternative intrave￾nous/oral antibiotic (grade D).
Continuation phase
► For individuals with M. abscessus isolates that are clar￾ithromycin sensitive or demonstrate inducible mac￾rolide resistance (see tables 7 and 8), the continua￾tion phase antibiotic regimen should include nebu￾lised amikacin and a macrolide (oral azithromycin or 
clarithromycin), in combination with one to three of 
the following oral antibiotics guided by drug suscep￾tibility and patient tolerance: clofazimine, linezolid, 
minocycline or doxycycline, moxifloxacin or cipro￾floxacin and cotrimoxazole (grade D).
► For individuals with M. abscessus complex isolates that 
demonstrate constitutive macrolide resistance (see 
tables 7 and 8), the continuation phase antibiotic reg￾imen should include nebulised amikacin in combina￾tion with two to four of the following oral antibiotics 
guided by drug susceptibility and patient tolerance: 
clofazimine, linezolid, minocycline or doxycycline, 
moxifloxacin or ciprofloxacin and cotrimoxazole 
(grade D).
► In the context of amikacin-resistant M. abscessus (ie, 
MIC >64mg/L or the isolate is known to have a 16S 
rRNA gene mutation conferring constitutive amika￾cin resistance), nebulised amikacin should be substi￾tuted with an alternative oral antibiotic (grade D).
► Antibiotic treatment for M. abscessus-PD should con￾tinue for a minimum of 12 months after culture 
conversion. However, individuals who fail to culture 
convert may benefit from a long-term suppressive an￾tibiotic regimen (grade D).
Good practice point
✔ Individuals with M. abscessus-PD should be managed 
in collaboration with a physician experienced in man￾aging NTM-PD.
Section 13: Is there a role for adjuvant therapies in the 
management of NTM-PD?
Recommendations
► Interferon-gamma is not recommended as adjuvant 
therapy in individuals with NTM-PD without a de￾fined immunodeficiency affecting intrinsic interfer￾on-gamma signalling (grade D).
► M. vaccae is not recommended as adjuvant therapy in 
individuals with NTM-PD (grade D).
Section 14: What investigations should be performed during 
treatment or following treatment for NTM-PD?
Microbiological outcomes
Recommendations
► Sputum samples should be sent for mycobacterial cul￾ture every 4–12 weeks during treatment and for 12 
months after completing treatment to assess the mi￾crobiological response (grade D) (see box 2).
► If there is doubt about persisting NTM infection de￾spite negative sputum cultures, a CT-directed bron￾chial wash should be performed to assess the microbi￾ological response to treatment (grade D).
► In individuals who are unable to expectorate sputum, 
a CT scan followed by a CT-directed bronchial wash 
after 6 and 12 months treatment can be used to assess 
the microbiological response to treatment (grade D).
Good practice point
✔ In individuals who are unable to spontaneously ex￾pectorate sputum and in whom CT-directed bronchi￾al washings are not feasible, induced sputum samples 
should be sent for mycobacterial culture every 4–12 
weeks during treatment and for 12 months after com￾pleting treatment to assess the microbiological re￾sponse.
Radiological outcomes
Recommendation
► A CT scan should be performed shortly before start￾ing NTM treatment and at the end of NTM treatment 
to document the radiological response to treatment 
(grade D).
Good practice point
✔ During the course of treatment for NTM-PD, more 
frequent radiological monitoring may be indicated in 
selected individuals.
Clinical outcomes
Recommendation
► A detailed assessment of pulmonary and systemic 
symptoms should be recorded at each clinical review 
(grade D).

Good practice point
✔ A more detailed clinical assessment may include 
measurements of body weight, spirometry and sys￾temic inflammatory markers (ESR and CRP).
Therapeutic drug monitoring
Recommendations
► Therapeutic drug monitoring (other than for amino￾glycosides) should not be performed routinely in in￾dividuals’ prescribed antibiotic therapy for NTM-PD 
(grade D).
► When aminoglycosides are administered, serum lev￾els and the serum creatinine must be monitored and 
aminoglycoside dosing adjusted according to local 
policies (grade D).
Good practice point
✔ Therapeutic drug monitoring can be considered in 
individuals in whom gastrointestinal malabsorption, 
drug-drug interactions or suboptimal adherence may 
be adversely affecting treatment response.
Monitoring for drug toxicity
Recommendations
► When aminoglycosides are administered, serum lev￾els and the serum creatinine must be monitored and 
aminoglycoside dosing adjusted according to local 
policies (grade D).
► Audiometry should be considered before starting 
aminoglycosides and intermittently during treatment 
(frequency according to perceived risk and symp￾toms). Patients should be informed to stop aminogly￾coside treatment immediately and to inform the pre￾scriber if they develop tinnitus, vestibular disturbance 
or hearing loss (grade D).
► Assess visual acuity and colour vision before starting 
ethambutol and advise patients to stop treatment 
immediately and inform the prescriber if changes in 
visual acuity or colour vision occur (grade D).
► Serum ethambutol levels should be measured in pa￾tients with renal dysfunction (grade D).
Good practice points
✔ The frequency/type of toxicity monitoring required 
during NTM treatment is dependent on the drug 
regimen. Treatment-related adverse events and sug￾gested toxicity monitoring protocols are outlined in 
the NTM antibiotic treatment monograph (section 
18).
✔ Audiometry should be considered before starting 
azithromycin or clarithromycin and intermittently 
during treatment (frequency according to perceived 
risk and symptoms) and advise individuals to stop 
treatment immediately and inform the prescriber if 
they develop tinnitus, vestibular disturbance or hear￾ing loss.
✔ Perform an ECG before, and 2 weeks after, starting 
drugs (such as azithromycin or clarithromycin) that 
are known to prolong the QT interval.
Section 15: Are there differences in outcome between 
patients with NTM-PD treated in specialist versus non￾specialist care settings?
Recommendation
► Individuals with NTM-PD should be managed in col￾laboration with a physician experienced in managing 
NTM-PD (grade D).
Section 16: What is the role of surgery in the treatment of 
NTM-PD?
Recommendations
► The role of lung resection surgery in the manage￾ment of NTM-PD should be considered at the time 
of diagnosis and revisited in individuals who develop 
refractory disease (grade D).
► Lung resection surgery for NTM-PD may be indicat￾ed in individuals with localised areas of severe disease 
(grade D).
► Lung resection surgery for NTM-PD should only be 
performed following expert multidisciplinary assess￾ment in a centre experienced in managing individu￾als with NTM-PD (grade D).
► Individuals with NTM-PD should be established on 
antibiotic treatment prior to lung resection surgery 
and should continue treatment for 12 months after 
culture conversion (grade D).
► Following resection of a solitary NTM nodule in an in￾dividual with no other features of NTM-PD, antibiotic 
treatment is not usually required (grade D).
Good practice points
✔ Individuals with NTM-PD in whom lung resection sur￾gery is being considered should have a comprehen￾sive assessment of cardiopulmonary status in line with 
current guidance for lung cancer resection.
✔ Nutritional status should be optimised prior to lung 
resection surgery.
Section 17: Does NTM infection affect an individual’s 
suitability for lung transplantation?
Recommendations
► Individuals being considered for lung transplanta￾tion referral should be assessed for evidence of NTM￾PD(grade D).
► Isolation of NTM organisms including M. abscessus in 
potential lung transplant candidates should not pre￾clude referral and assessment for lung transplanta￾tion (grade D).
► Potential lung transplant candidates with evidence of 
NTM-PD should be treated whenever possible prior 
to listing to either eradicate the organism or lower 
bacterial load (grade D).
► Individuals with previous or current M. abscessus in￾fection or disease who are listed for lung transplan￾BMJ Open Respiratory Research: first published as 10.1136/bmjresp-2017-000242 on 19 October 2017.

tation should be counselled about the high postop￾erative risk of developing invasive and disseminated 
NTM disease which causes significant morbidity and 
necessitates prolonged treatment with a multidrug 
antibiotic regimen (grade D).
Good practice points
✔ Individuals with NTM-PD should demonstrate an 
ability to tolerate optimal antibiotic therapy before 
listing for lung transplantation.
✔ Progressive NTM-PD despite optimal antibiotic thera￾py is likely to be a contraindication to listing for lung 
transplantation.
Section 18: NTM drug monograph
The treatment of NTM-PD involves complex drug regi￾mens that are commonly associated with intolerance and 
toxicity. The purpose of this monograph is to facilitate anti￾biotic prescribing in people with NTM-PD, but it should 
only be used in conjunction with, and not as a substitute 
for, local/national prescribing formularies. The mono￾graph also provides guidance on the type and frequency of 
monitoring for drug toxicity which must, however, be deter￾mined on a case-by-case basis, informed by patient symp￾toms at each clinical encounter, and adjusted according to 
existing comorbidities. The information in this section of 
the guideline is provided as an aid to monitoring adverse 
effects and is correct at the time of publication. Readers are 
advised to confirm the latest information with their phar￾macy colleagues.
The NTM drug monograph can be found as section 18 
of the full guideline and also on the BTS website at: www.
