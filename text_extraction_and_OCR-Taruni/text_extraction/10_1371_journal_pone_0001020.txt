microRNAs have recently emerged as master regulators of gene expression during development and cell differentiation.
Although profound changes in gene expression also occur during antigen-induced T cell differentiation, the role of miRNAs in
the process is not known. We compared the miRNA expression profiles between antigen-specific naı¨ve, effector and memory
CD8+ T cells using 3 different methods-small RNA cloning, miRNA microarray analysis and real-time PCR. Although many
miRNAs were expressed in all the T cell subsets, the frequency of 7 miRNAs (miR-16, miR-21, miR-142-3p, miR-142-5p, miR-150,
miR-15b and let-7f) alone accounted for ,60% of all miRNAs, and their expression was several fold higher than the other
expressed miRNAs. Global downregulation of miRNAs (including 6/7 dominantly expressed miRNAs) was observed in effector T
cells compared to naı¨ve cells and the miRNA expression levels tended to come back up in memory T cells. However, a few
miRNAs, notably miR-21 were higher in effector and memory T cells compared to naı¨ve T cells. These results suggest that
concomitant with profound changes in gene expression, miRNA profile also changes dynamically during T cell differentiation.
Sequence analysis of the cloned mature miRNAs revealed an extensive degree of end polymorphism. While 39end
polymorphisms dominated, heterogeneity at both ends, resembling drosha/dicer processing shift was also seen in miR-142,
suggesting a possible novel mechanism to generate new miRNA and/or to diversify miRNA target selection. Overall, our results
suggest that dynamic changes in the expression of miRNAs may be important for the regulation of gene expression during
antigen-induced T cell differentiation. Our study also suggests possible novel mechanisms for miRNA biogenesis and function.

INTRODUCTION
During an immune response, antigen-specific naı¨ve T cells
proliferate enormously and develop into effector T cells capable
of immediate effector functions such as cytotoxicity and cytokine
production[1,2]. After clearance of antigen, most of the effector T
cells are eliminated by activation-induced cell death, but some
antigen experienced cells differentiate into relatively quiescent
memory T cells which persist over long periods of time and mount
a rapid and augmented response upon rechallenge with the
antigen[3,4,5]. While naı¨ve and memory T cells are quiescent and
express molecules needed for trafficking from blood to lymphoid
organs, effector cells are actively dividing, produce various effector
cytokines and cytotoxic molecules, and express molecules needed for
trafficking into tissue sites of infection[6,7]. Thus, major changes in
gene expression characterize these differentiation states, with gene
expression getting enormously upregulated in effector T cells, but
decreasing in memory T cells[8]. Although transcriptional regulation
of gene expression has been well studied, the role of microRNAs in
the process of T cell differentiation is unclear.
RNA interference mediated by microRNAs has emerged as an
important mechanism for global regulation of gene expression in
plants and animals, including humans (reviewed in ref[9,10]).
miRNAs are small RNAs that regulate gene expression by
translational repression and/or mRNA degradation[9,11]. miR￾NAs are genomically encoded and are transcribed in the nucleus
as long primary miRNAs, which are then processed by drosha￾DGCR8 into ,70 bp pre miRNA[12,13,14]. The pre-miRNA is
exported out of the nucleus by exportin 5[15,16] and is further
processed in the cytoplasm by the enzyme dicer into ,22 nt
double stranded mature miRNA[17,18,19]. One strand of the
miRNA associates with RNA induced silencing complex (RISC) to
mediate gene silencing[20]. Generally the miRNA is imperfectly
complementary to the 39UTR sequence of the target mRNA and
forms a bulge upon binding[21]. The 59 2–7 nt of the miRNA strand
is perfectly complementary (seed region) and defines the target
specificity of the miRNA[22,23,24]. A single miRNA can regulate
many target mRNAs containing binding sites for that miRNA [25].
A number of miRNA profiling studies have shown that the
expression of miRNA changes during hematopoietic development
and carcinogenesis, suggesting that miRNAs might be important
players in these processes[26,27,28,29]. Although the exact functional
consequence of expression of a given miRNA is largely unknown,
recent studies have clearly demonstrated the importance of individual
miRNAs in hematopoietic cell development and function. For
instance, miR-181a has been shown to regulate T and B cell
development when ectopically expressed in hematopoietic progenitor
cells[26]. A more recent paper has further demonstrated that miR￾181a could modulate T cell sensitivity to antigen stimulation[30].
Another study showed that miR-150 could block B cell development
when expressed prematurely[31]. Similarly, miR-155 has been
shown to regulate germinal center reaction as well as helper T cell

response[32,33]. Although these studies suggest that miRNAs have
important roles in immune cell development and function,
a comprehensive analysis of miRNA expression during antigen￾specific T cell differentiation is still lacking. Thus in this study, we
analyzed the miRNA expression profile in antigen-specific naı¨ve,
effector and memory CD8 T cells using the method we have
described earlier to derive these cell types[34]. We report that a few
miRNAs are dominantly expressed and that their expression pattern
changes during the differentiation process. We also note a high degree
of heterogeneity in the mature miRNA ends in the T cell subsets.
RESULTS
Dynamic regulation of miRNAs during antigen￾induced CD8 T cell differentiation
To determine if the expression profile of microRNAs changes
during T cell differentiation, small RNAs were cloned and
sequenced from pure populations of antigen-specific naı¨ve, effector
and memory CD8 T cells, generated as described earlier[34]. In
total, 1498 small RNAs were cloned and their length ranged from
15 to 35 nucleotides, with a peak at 21 to 23 nucleotides. The
cloned sequences were queried using BLASTN against miRBase
(v.10.0). With respect to the annotated sequence of a particular
miRNA, one single nucleotide internal mismatch and up to 3
nucleotide mismatch at the 39 end were allowed to designate the
sequence as the miRNA. Up to 3 nucleotide addition or deletion at
both ends were also allowed, as long as these nucleotides
completely matched the miRNA genomic sequence. Of 1498
cloned sequences, 837 (343 in naı¨ve, 240 in effector and 254 in
memory T cells) clones corresponded to previously annotated
miRNAs. Many of the miRNAs were cloned multiple times and
the total number of individual microRNAs cloned in naı¨ve,
effector and memory T cells constituted 69, 51 and 54 respectively.
The distribution of various microRNAs, the number of clones
isolated for each miRNA (miRNA frequency) as well as their
representation as a percent of total miRNA pool for each of the
different T cell subsets are depicted in Supplemental Table S1.
Although a total of 94 known miRNAs were cloned at varying
frequencies, some miRNAs dominated in all subsets. Strikingly,
clones from seven miRNAs (miR-16, miR-21, miR-142-3p, miR￾142-5p, miR-150, miR-15b and let-7f) constituted nearly 60% of
the total clones and of these, 3 miRNAs (miR-16, miR-142-3p and
miR-21) alone accounted for ,40% of all clones (Table S1 and
Fig 1), suggesting that these are the dominantly expressed miRNAs
in CD8 T cells.
Among the 7 highest expressed miRNAs, 6 showed dramatically
reduced frequencies in effector T cells compared to naı¨ve T cells,
and the expression of these miRNAs tended to increase back in
memory T cells (Fig. 1, left panel). However miR-21 was an
exception, showing reverse kinetics with highest frequency in

effector T cells followed by memory T cells and lowest expression
in naı¨ve T cells (Fig. 1, right panel).
Although direct cloning has been widely used to profile the
miRNA expression level, it may not be a good method for the
relative quantitation of low frequency miRNAs, particularly when
small-scale sequencing is used as done in this study. Moreover,
although it is a good method to determine the relative expression
level of miRNAs within a given sample, it may not be ideal for
comparison of expression levels between different samples because
it is hard to normalize the data between samples. Therefore, we
also used a miRNA microarray to further analyze the expression
profiles in the different T cell subsets. RNAs from T cell subsets
generated in 2 independent experiments were profiled with LNA
(locked nucleotide acid)-based miRNA microarray. Essentially
similar results were seen in both sets attesting to the reproducibility
of the results (Fig. 2).
Analysis of the expression levels in the microarray confirmed
that the 6 (out of 7) miRNAs (miR-16, miR-142-3p, miR-142-5p,
miR-150, miR-15b and let-7f) that showed the highest frequency
in direct cloning, were significantly down regulated in effector cells
compared to naı¨ve T cells and the expression tended to increase
back in memory T cells (Fig 2) as observed in direct cloning
method. Moreover, this pattern of differences was also evident for
most of the low frequency miRNAs—around 80% of miRNAs had
the same pattern (Fig 2 and Table S2). In fact, although the same
amount of total RNA was used for each sample (so that all the
microarray data are actually normalized to total RNA amount),
the total miRNA hybridization signal in naı¨ve T cells was 2.98 fold
higher than in effector T cells and 1.45 fold higher than in
memory T cells (Table S2), suggesting that the total amount of
miRNAs in effector T cells is only ,33% of that in naı¨ve T cells,
and the miRNA expression increased in memory T cells to
constitute ,69% of that in naı¨ve T cells.
Because it is hard to normalize the data between samples in
direct cloning, to more rigorously reanalyze the direct cloning
data, the cloning data was normalized according to total
hybridization signal from the array (by dividing the cloning
frequency in effector and memory cells by 2.98 and 1.45
respectively, Table S3). When examined in this way, the
expression level in both assays showed a good degree of correlation
(Fig 3 A, B). Taken together, our results suggest that except for
a few miRNAs such as miR-21 and miR-31, most miRNAs are
down regulated in effector T cells compared to naı¨ve T cell and
tend to increase back in memory T cells.
We also confirmed the T cell subset-specific differences in
miRNA expression in a real-time PCR assay. Because the
extensive 39 end heterogeneity that we noted in miRNAs cloned
from T cells (discussed later) might affect detection by ABI
Taqman microRNA assay, we used a 39RACE RT-PCR based
real-time PCR. The PCR results for the 6 highly expressed
miRNAs correlated well with both the array data and the
normalized cloning data (Fig 3 A, B and C). However, examina￾tion of let-7f (one of the 7 highest expressed miRNAs) was
excluded in this assay because of the difficulty in designing primers
that can distinguish the different let-7 family members without
ambiguity. We also performed real-time PCR for another 14
miRNAs that were expressed at lower levels (Fig S1). We
arbitrarily determined the correlation according to their move￾ment in the same direction among the 3 methods. The venn
diagram (Fig 4) depicts the extent of correlation among the 3
methods for all 20 miRNAs tested by real-time PCR. Differential
expression of 9 miRNAs in naı¨ve, effector and memory T cells
could be confirmed by all 3 methods (overlap in the diagram). The
expression levels of 9 other miRNAs correlated in 2 assays and
only 2 miRNAs did not correlate in any 2 methods. Overall, our
results clearly show that miRNA expression is dynamically
regulated during antigen-specific T cell differentiation.
Changes in miRNA expression such as downregulation of miR￾150 and upregulation of miR-155 has been reported previously
following a brief stimulation of T cells with aCD3[35,36].
However, we found a striking global downregulation of miRNA
in antigen stimulated T cell that had fully differentiated into
effector T cells, seven days after stimulation. It is of interest to

further examine the temporal pattern of miRNA changes at
different times after antigen stimulation.
Identification of a novel miRNA—miR669d in T cells
We also cloned what appears to be a novel miRNA, not annotated
in the latest version of miRBase (v.10.0). A sequence (ACUUGU￾GUGUGCAUGUAUAUGU) that appears to be a homologue of
miR-699a (AGUUGUGUGUGCAUGUUCAUGU) was cloned
once in both naı¨ve and memory T cells. Interestingly, this
sequence was found to perfectly match two regions in the of
murine chromosome 2: nt 10386237-10386258(+) and nt
10389511-10389532(+), which is located in intron 10 of gene
sfmbt2 (Scm-like with four mbt domains 2). The sequence forms
a typical stem loop structure that appears to be the precursor of
miRNA (Fig. 5 A, B). Its expression in murine T cells was also
confirmed by real-time PCR (Fig. 5 C). Therefore, we have
designated the novel miRNA as mmu-miR-669d.
Heterogeneity in the mature microRNA sequences
A detailed analysis of the cloning data revealed that compared to
the mature miRNA sequences annotated in the miRBase, the
miRNAs in T cells exhibit an extensive degree of polymorphism at
the ends. Although some clones in each miRNA contained the
exact match for the annotated mature miRNA sequence, the
majority of the clones within a given miRNA did not match
the sequence in the miRBase (release 10.0). For example, the most
prevalent sequence for miR-21 we found was UAGCUUAUCA￾GACUGAUGUUGAC, while in the miRBase it is UAGCUU￾AUCAGACUGAUGUUGA. Similarly, the prevalent sequence
for miR-142-3p was GUAGUGUUUCCUACUUUAUGGA
while in the miRBase it is UGUAGUGUUUCCUACUUUAU￾GGA and for miR-142-5p, it was CCCAUAAAGUAGAAAG￾CACUAC in our study, while in the miRBase it is CAUAAA￾GUAGAAAGCACUACU. Also the most prevalent sequence
varied between different T cell subsets. For example, the most

prevalent sequence for miR-21 in naı¨ve T cells was UAG￾CUUAUCAGACUGAUGUUGA (57% of total), while in effector
and memory cells it is UAGCUUAUCAGACUGAUGUUGAC
(64% of total, Table 1).
Overall, most of the mature miRNAs that were cloned in
high frequency had more than 3 variations, with the extreme
example of miR-142-3p, which had 20 variations (Tables 1 and
S4). The polymorphisms included: 39 end deletion (,36% of
total); 39 end extensions (,15% of total, with preferential
incorporation of A or U residues), majority of which were
untemplated; and 59 end variation (,4% of total, Tables 1 and
S4). Such variations have also been noted previously [29,37,38].
However, the polymorphism that we observed appears to be
more dramatic than previously reported in C. elegans: we observed
39 end heterogeneity in 51% of the 834 annotated miRNA
sequences cloned in our study (Table S4) as opposed to the 15%
reported for C. elegans [38]. Similarly, we found 4% heterogeneity
at the 59 end (Table S4) compared to 0.5% reported in C.
elegans[38]. And for most miRNAs cloned with high frequency,
we found two or more dominant variants (Tables 1 and S4), while
the majority of the miRNAs contain a single dominant sequence in
C. elegans[38].
Compared to 39 ends, the 59 ends were more homogenous.
However, we did observe variations in 4% of total clones at the 59
end. An interesting 59 end variation that we observed appeared to
be 59 end degradation product—3 or more nucleotides were
deleted in the 59 end while the 39 end remained intact (examples
can be seen in miR-21, miR-15b, miR-26a and let-7f in Table S4).
This may imply that degradation of these mature miRNAs starts
from the 59 end, which might be an efficient way to eliminate
miRNA activity quickly, since the 59 end is the seed sequence that
determines target gene selection[24].
Of particular interest was the variations observed in miR-142,
which appeared to be the result of a shift in drosha/dicer processing:
1, 2 or 3 nucleotide deletions in the 59 end associated with
a corresponding increase in the number of templated nucleotides at
the 39 end. This pattern of variation was seen in both miR-142-5p
and miR-142-3p at a high frequency (Table 1). Since changes at the
59 seed sequence (nt 2–7) is thought to affect the miRNA target
specificity[39], a shift in drosha/dicer processing might represent
a novel mechanism to generate new miRNAs.
Taken together, our results suggest that a given miRNA hairpin
may generate more than one product, and therefore designation of
a particular sequence for a given mature miRNA may not sufficiently
describe all the miRNA forms present inside the cell. Although the
relative biological significance of each species within a given miRNA
remains to be determined, such variations might possibly affect the
stability/subcellular localization, functional efficacy or miRNA
target-specificity (particularly with changes in the 59 end affecting
the miRNA ‘‘seed’’ region). However, we cannot rule out the
possibility that some of the variations noted may represent cloning
artifacts, although this appears unlikely (see Discussion)

miRNA polymorphism can affect detection by
real-time PCR employing stem-loop primer
mediated RT-PCR
As mentioned earlier, the miRNA variation at the 39 end appears to
be more frequent than previously thought. This may affect
determination of miRNA expression by some assays that depend
on the exact match of the 39 terminus as the basis for high efficiency
detection. The real-time PCR employing stem-loop primers that
match the 39 end of miRNA to improve the reverse transcription
efficiency is one of the most popular assays to profile and detect
miRNA expression[40]. To test if the 39 end variation affects the
detection efficacy, we used miR-16, miR-16+1(one nucleotide
extension at 39 end) and miR-16-1 (one nucleotide deletion at 39
end) oligonucleotides as templates in the stem-loop primer-based real
time PCR developed by ABI (Applied Biosystems, US). Since the
exact match of 39 terminal of miRNA is the basis for high efficiency
of this method, 39end variations should negatively affect detection by
this method. Indeed, the efficacy of stem-loop based real time PCR
was decreased by 2 cycles in one nucleotide deletion variation,
showing that it is only 25% efficient compared to the correctly
matched template. Surprisingly however, the efficacy did not change
with one nucleotide template extension (Fig. 6).
DISCUSSION
This is the first report that comprehensively analyzes the miRNA
expression profile during antigen-specific T cell differentiation.
Our results indicate that only a few miRNAs are dominantly
expressed in CD8 T cells and that their expression is dynamically
regulated during the differentiation process. Moreover, the level of
miRNA expression appears to inversely correlate with the
activation status of the cells. For example the level of miRNA
expression was highest in the non-replicating and functionally
quiescent naı¨ve T cells, but was dramatically reduced in the
actively dividing and functionally competent effector T cells and
their expression once again increased when the antigen-stimulated
T cells were converted into the relatively quiescent memory T
cells. Theses results suggest that miRNAs may modulate the
differentiation status of antigen-stimulated T cells.
Recent studies in conditional dicer-deficient mice and mice
deficient for individual miRNAs have highlighted the importance
of miRNAs in regulating T cell development, homeostasis and
function[32,41]. However, a comprehensive study of miRNA
profiles during antigen-specific T cell differentiation has not been
reported. Our direct cloning results show that although over 90
known miRNAs were cloned from CD8 T cells, only 7 miRNAs
were dominantly expressed and constituted ,60% of the total
miRNA pool. This is also consistent with previous studies showing
that some miRNAs are dominantly expressed in specific cell types
and tissues [29,37,42]. Since the miRNA-mediated repression of
gene expression is dependent on the miRNA amounts as well as
the target mRNA levels[24], the dominantly expressed miRNAs
may control the abundantly expressed genes in CD8 T cells.
However, we are not suggesting that the other miRNAs expressed
at low frequencies are functionally unimportant.
A recent study has shown that regulation of miRNA expression
characterizes the stage-specific development of thymocytes[29].
We also found that the miRNA expression levels dynamically
change between naı¨ve, effector and memory T cell subsets. A
striking global downregulation of miRNA was seen in effector T
cells. This trend was evident in all 3 methods examined: direct
cloning, microarray profiling as well as RT-PCR. According to
total microarray hybridization signal, the total miRNA level is
down regulated 2.98 fold in effector compared to naive T cells.
Interestingly, the changes in miRNA expression we observed
appear to inversely correlate with the degree of cellular activation.
Antigen stimulation of naı¨ve T cells results in a massive upregula￾tion of gene expression that is needed for effector T cells to divide
actively, gain functional competence and change migratory
properties[6,8], and effector T cell is the cell type where we
found the least overall miRNA. Since the upregulation of gene
expression occurs at both the protein and mRNA levels, while the
miRNA-mediated effect is largely thought to be mediated by
translational repression, it is possible that the abundantly
expressed miRNAs may primarily control the key transcription
factors involved in T cell activation. Massive downregulation of
miRNA expression has also been reported in cancer cells [43,44].
Although the global decrease in miRNA level has been hypothe￾sized to reflect the dedifferentiated status of cancer cells [44], our
results suggest that it may indeed reflect the quantum of protein
synthesis needed for cellular activity because effector cells are more
differentiated compared to naı¨ve T cells. In contrast to the general
trend for downregulation in effector T cells, a few miRNAs were
higher in effector T cells compared to naı¨ve T cells. Indeed several
genes, including those associated with lymph node trafficking,
expressed in naı¨ve T cells are silenced in effector T cells[7,8].
Further functional studies are needed to test if miRNAs

miRNAs in CD8 T Cell Subsets

upregulated in effector T cells suppress the expression of naı¨ve T
cell-specific genes in effector cells.
Two recent studies have also profiled miRNA in CD8 T
cells[29,45] and our results are consistent with both the studies.
For example, cloning miRNAs from single positive thymic CD8 T
cells, Nelson et al[29] also found that a few miRNAs prevailed in
frequency. In fact, the highly expressed miRNAs were also similar
to this study, in that 7 miRNAs appeared in both studies among
the 10 highest expressed miRNAs, with miR-142-3p showing the
highest frequency in both. However, compared to their study,
miR-181a and miR-24 were lower in frequency and miR-29a and
miR-142-5p were higher in our study. Landgraf et al [45] profiling
miRNA expression in human peripheral blood CD8 T cells also
found miR-142 to be the highest expressed miRNA. Similarly,
they also found high level expression of miR-15a family (including
miR-15a, miR-15b and miR-16), miR-21, miR-98 family (in￾cluding all the let-7), miR-150 and miR-26a.
Although many methods can be used to profile miRNA
expression, direct small RNA cloning is the only method that
provides actual visualization of mature miRNAs. In our study,
direct cloning revealed that mature miRNAs exhibit an extensive
degree of end polymorphism in mouse T cells. Although we can
not rule out the possibility that some of the observed poly￾morphism may reflect artifacts of the cloning procedure, this
appears to be unlikely because many variant sequences were
cloned multiple times and a high frequency of 59 end variation was
only seen in miR-142, while the majority of miRNAs had identical
59 end. Moreover, although not described in detail except for
a study by Ruby et al in C elegans[38], miRNA end polymorphism
has also been observed by others using small RNA cloning
approach[29,37] and also other methods like RNA-primed Array￾based Klenow Extension (RAKE)[46]. Our data show that the
ends of mature miRNAs are much more polymorphic than
reported in C. elegans. We found 2 or more main variations for
most mature miRNAs in the mouse T cells while one dominant
sequence characterizes most mature miRNAs in C. elegans.
Although not alluded to by the authors, a careful examination of
northern blot results of some published reports also reveal multiple
bands for one miRNA[26,31]. One convincing example in C.
elegans is miR-84. As shown in Fig. 3 in the paper by Lau and
coworkers[47], miR-84 is the only miRNA (out of 15 that were
tested) that shows 3 clearly visible bands in northern blots,
indicating that miR-84 has 3 main variations. Similarly, an
examination of the deep sequencing data depicted in Table S1 in
the report by Ruby and coworkers [38] also shows that miR-84
has 3 main variations. Thus, some miRNAs in C. elegans also have
more than 1 dominant variation, suggesting that multiple
dominant sequences for one miRNA is a conserved phenomenon,
although it happens to a lower extent in C. elegans.
Clearly, the changes in the 59 end seed sequence can affect
target selection[39]. However, the biological significance of the 39
end polymorphism we observed is not immediately apparent,
although the extent of their occurrence suggests that it could be
important in miRNA biology. For example, it may possibly affect
the stability/subcellular localization and/or miRNA functional
efficacy. It has been reported in plants that untemplated 39 end
extension appears to be a signal for mature miRNA degrada￾tion[48]. It is possible that it might be the same in mammals.
Whatever the significance, our study shows that designation of one
sequence for a give miRNA may not be accurate to describe all
miRNA species in a cell. Moreover as we have shown, the 39 end
variation can affect the detection efficiency of real-time PCR assay
employing stem-loop primer and thus should be taken into
consideration when designing a detection method for miRNAs.
The method RAKE that requires the exact match of the 39 end
also appears to be affected [46,49]. Additionally, the real picture of
mature miRNA sequence might help generate more accurate
models in bioinformatic calculations such as target prediction.
It is intriguing how the end polymorphism is generated. Since
a majority of mature miRNAs have identical 59 ends, irrespective
of whether they are derived from the 59 or 39 chains of the hairpin,
it appears that both drosha and dicer can set a precise 59 end.
Thus, the majority of end polymorphisms is likely generated
downstream of drosha/dicer processing. It is reasonable to predict
that there are enzymes with end modification activity that could
generate mature miRNA end polymorphism.

miRNAs in CD8 T Cell Subsets
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 8 October 2007 | Issue 10 | e1020

End polymorphism in miR-142 was very different compared to
other miRNAs—both miR-142-5p and miR-142-3p were the only
miRNAs that showed a high frequency of 59 end changes. This
polymorphism appears to result from a shift in the drosha/dicer
processing, in that 1-3 nucleotide deletions at the 59 end were
associated with a corresponding number of templated nucleotide
extensions at the 39 end. It has recently been proposed that the
distance from the stem-flanking ssRNA junction determines the
drosha cleavage site and the cleavage occurs approximately 11bp
from the junction. Dicer then measures from the terminal set by
drosha for further processing[14]. Although most miRNA 59 ends
were intact, suggesting that drosha/dicer processing is precise, the
changes observed in miR-142 suggest that a shift in drosha/dicer
processing can sometimes occur at a relatively high frequency.
Since 59 end changes can alter target specificity[39], this may also
represent a novel mechanism to generate additional miRNAs.
Further studies are needed to verify this hypothesis. Although how
a shift in drosha/dicer processing occurs is not known, A to I
editing may be involved. It has been reported that pri-miR-142 is
under heavy A to I editing by ADAR. miR-142 expression level
increased significantly after ADAR was mutated and this change
appears to be miR-142-specific and not a result of a general effect
on the level of miRNA in ADAR mutant mice[50]. Thus, it is
possible that the A to I editing may change the stem loop structure
or affect the ability of drosha-DGCR8 to cleave precisely.
Interestingly, 2 (out of 34) instances of A to I editing could be
seen in miR-142-5p, while it was barely detected in other miRNAs
in this study (Tables 1 and S4).
In summary, our study documents the changes in miRNA
expression during T cell differentiation and points to the extensive
degree of polymorphism in mature miRNA ends. Further studies
on the differentially expressed miRNAs should aid in the under￾standing of T cell differentiation process and may ultimately pave
the way to manipulate the process of adaptive immunity.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Mice and T cell subsets
TCR-LCMV-P14/TCR transgenic (specific for LCMV gp33-41)
mice were purchased from the Taconic Farms, Germantown, NY.
Naı¨ve CD8 T cells were purified from splenocytes of mice by
negative selection using the murine T cell CD8 subset isolation kit
(R&D systems, Minneapolis, MN) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The isolated cells were .90% pure, and 95% of them
were CD62L+, CD69- (not shown). The method to generate
effector and memory T cell has been described[34] . Briefly,
splenocytes from P14 mice were stimulated with 10 mg/ml of gp33-
41 peptide (KAVYNFATC, synthesized at BioSource Internation￾al) for 1 hour and cultured in RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS.
Two days later, the cells were washed and cultured in fresh medium
supplemented with 20 ng/ml of either rIL-2 or rIL-15 (R&D
Systems) and cultured for 7 days. The cells were then harvested
and viable T cells were recovered by Histopaque (Sigma) gradient
centrifugation. Almost all viable cells after 7 days of culture were
CD8+ and those cultured in IL-2 were CD62L-, CD25+ and those
cultured in IL-15 were CD62L+, CD25- (not shown).
Small RNA cloning
Total RNA and small RNA fractions were isolated using Qiagen
miRNeasy kit according to the manufacturer’s instruction. The
cloning method has been described previously[29]. Briefly, small
RNAs were ligated to 39 adenylated linker (59-rAppCTGGTAT￾CTGTGTAT GGddC-39) in a buffer without ATP, followed by 59
linker (59-ACCACAGAGAAACC GrCrArG-39) ligation prior to
gel purification. The ligated short RNAs were then separated on
15% urea polyacrylamide gels and purified. After reverse tran￾scription and amplification using 59-GACTAGCTTGGTGCCA￾TACACAGATACCAG-39 oligo as forward primer and 59-GAG￾CCAACAGGCACCACAGAGAAACCGCAG-39 oligo as re￾verse primer, the cDNAs were digested with PvuII to eliminate
linker contamination. The amplified cDNAs were concatamerized
and cloned into T vector and sequenced at Functional Bioscience.
Bioinformatic analysis of individual short RNA clones from the
sequencing results has been described previously[51].
LNA-based miRNA microarray
miRNA profiling in RNAs from naı¨ve, effector and memory T cell
were performed using LNA mercuryTM microarray at Exiqon
(Denmark). The quality of the total RNA was verified by an
Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer profile. A mixture of equal amount of
total RNA from naı¨ve, effector and memory T cell were made as
reference. 2 mg total RNA from sample and reference pool were
labeled with Hy3TM and Hy5TM fluorescent label, respec￾tively, using the miRCURYTM LNA Array labeling kit (Exiqon,
Denmark). The Hy3TM-labeled samples and a Hy5TM-labeled
reference pool RNA samples were mixed pair-wise and hybridized
to the miRCURYTM LNA array version 8.0 (Exiqon, Denmark),
which contains capture probes targeting all human, mouse and rat
miRNA listed in the miRBASE version 8.0. The hybridization was
performed according to the miRCURYTM LNA array manual
using a Tecan HS4800 hybridization station (Tecan, Austria) and
the slides were scanned by a ScanArray 4000 XL scanner (Packard
Biochip Technologies, USA). Image analysis was carried out using
the ImaGene 6.1.0 software (BioDiscovery, Inc., USA). The
quantified signals were normalized using the global Lowess
(LOcally WEighted Scatterplot Smoothing) regression algorithm.
39RACE RT-PCR based real-time PCR
39RACE RT-PCR based real-time PCR is modified from
previously described methods [52,53]. Briefly, 300 ng small RNA
fraction was polyadenylated with poly(A) tailing kit (Epicentre
Biotechnologies, US) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The reaction was extracted with phenol/chloroform, and pre￾cipitated with ethanol. The poly(A) tailed small RNAs were
annealed with an anchored oligo dT—miR RT oligo dT and
transcribed with Superscript III first chain synthesis kit (Invitrogen)

according to manufacturer’s instruction. cDNAs were amplified
with SYBR green 2x mix (Takara) in a icycler system (Bio-rad)
with 15 seconds at 95uC and 30 seconds at 60uC for 45 cycles,
followed by a thermal denaturing step to generate the melting
