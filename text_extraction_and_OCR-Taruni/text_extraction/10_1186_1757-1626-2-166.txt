Abstract
Introduction: Gallbladder perforation is a rare but life threatening event. We describe a case of
gallbladder perforation encountered at initial presentation.
Case presentation: A 51 years old male, without any known medical co-morbidity, presented
with a 1-day history of sudden-onset abdominal pain and abdominal distension. On examination,
his abdomen was distended with generalized tenderness on palpation. Abdominal x-ray showed no
signs of intestinal obstruction or pneumoperitoneum. Computed tomography scan of the abdomen
showed appearance suggestive of gallbladder perforation. The patient was taken to the operating
room and a diagnostic laparoscopy was performed revealing yellowish green fluid in the
peritoneum. Difficulty in visualization of the anatomy led to conversion of the procedure to an open
laparotomy. Intra-operative findings included a perforation near the neck of the gall bladder in
association with a 2 × 1 cm gall stone. Near-total cholecystectomy was performed and a single large
gall stone was retrieved. The peritoneal cavity was washed with normal saline and a drain was
placed. The rectus sheath was closed but the wound was kept open for healing by delayed primary
closure. The patient's hospital course was uneventful and he was discharged from the hospital on
the 3rd post-operative day. He returned to the clinic after one week whereby his drain was
removed and his wound closed.
Conclusion: Gallbladder perforation is an unusual initial presentation of gallbladder disease. Early
diagnosis of gallbladder perforation and immediate surgical intervention are of prime importance
in decreasing morbidity and mortality associated with this condition.
Introduction
Empyema, gallstone ileus, cholecystoenteric fistula,
emphysematous cholecystitis, gallbladder perforation
and biliary peritonitis are among the severe complications
of acute calculous cholecystitis. These complications are
associated with increased morbidity and mortality [1],
and can develop at a high rate if the condition is left
untreated.
According to one study, 12 (3.3%) cases of acute cholecys￾titis were complicated by gall bladder perforation out of a
total of 386 patients [1], while another study has reported
the incidence of gall bladder perforation complicating
acute cholecystitis in 5.9% of 31 patients [2]. Gall bladder
perforation has also been reported in literature with acute
acalculous cholecystitis but at a lower rate [3].

We report here the case of a 51 years old gentleman who
presented with acute free perforation of the gall bladder
and associated biliary peritonitis in the absence of any
previous clinical episodes of acute cholecystitis.
Case presentation
A 51-years-old Pakistani male, without any known medi￾cal co-morbidity, presented to the emergency department
at our institution with a 1 day history of sudden-onset and
severe abdominal pain along with abdominal distension.
The pain had started after a long drive of 12 - 14 hours. It
was initially localized to the right upper quadrant and
right lumbar region but had evolved to a more generalized
distribution over time. The pain was aggravated on move￾ment and relieved by rest. There were no other associated
symptoms. His past surgical history was significant for a
repaired left sided inguinal hernia 10 years back.
The patient was in obvious anxiety and distress when first
encountered in the emergency room. His vital signs were
stable except for an increased pulse of 105 beats per
minute. Examination of his respiratory system revealed
vesicular breathing with decreased intensity of breath
sounds in the right lung base as well as dullness on per￾cussion on the right side of the chest. His abdomen was
distended with generalized tenderness on palpation and
minimal movement with respiration. No organomegaly
was appreciated on the physical examination. His bowel
sounds were sluggish.
The laboratory tests done at the time of admission are
shown in table 1. The patient had mild anemia, mildly
reduced hematocrit, leukocytosis with neutrophilia and
hyponatremia. His serum amylase, lipase and random
blood sugar levels were all within normal limits. His
abdominal x-ray showed sub-optimal inspiration with
minimal right sided pleural effusion. However, there were
no signs of intestinal obstruction or pneumoperitoneum
noted. Subsequently, computed tomography (CT) scan of
the abdomen was done. Gallbladder margins were not
very clearly identifiable; there was significant perichole￾cystic fat stranding with pericholecystic fluid. A circular
high density focus in the proximity of gallbladder was
identified which was thought to be representing a gall￾stone. Mild ascites was also present. These features were
collectively suggestive f gallbladder perforation. (Figures 1
and 2)
The patient's emergent management included nothing per
oral status, regular vitals and input/output charting, inser￾tion of nasogastric tube, administration of intravenous
fluids, narcotic analgesics, proton pump inhibitors, meto￾chlopramide, ceftriaxone, metronidazole, and ampicillin.
The patient was then taken to the operating room and a
diagnostic laparoscopy was performed. It revealed free
yellowish green fluid, most likely bilious, in the perito￾neum. As the triangle of Calot could not be identified on
laparoscopy, the procedure was converted to an open
laparotomy. Intra-operative findings included presence of
frank bile in the abdomen and a thick walled gall bladder.
Dense adhesions of the gall bladder with surrounding
structures were observed. A small perforation was visible
near the neck of gall bladder in association with a large
gall stone. The anatomy of the Calot's triangle was still
obscure. A near-total or partial cholecystectomy including
the perforated area was performed and a single large gall
stone measuring around 2 × 1 cm was retrieved. The peri￾toneal cavity was washed with copious amounts of nor￾mal saline and a drain was placed. The rectus sheath was
closed with loop polydioxanon (PDS) but the wound was
kept open for healing by delayed primary closure.
Histopathology of the specimen showed full thickness
gallbladder wall lined by mucosa with focal ulceration.
Rokitansky aschoff sinuses were also seen. A pathological
diagnosis of acute on chronic cholecystitis was made.
The patient's hospital course was uneventful. His symp￾toms significantly improved and he was discharged from
the hospital on the third post-operative day. He returned
to the clinic after one week when his drain was removed
and his wound closed.
Discussion
Gallbladder perforation is a rare but life threatening event
[4]. Broadly speaking, gallbladder perforations can be
traumatic, iatrogenic, or idiopathic. Conditions such as
cholelithiasis, infections, malignancy, steroid therapy,
diabetes mellitus and atherosclerotic heart disease are all
predisposing factors for gallbladder perforation [5].
Niemeier in 1934 classified free gallbladder perforation
into 3 types. Type 1 (acute) is associated with generalized
biliary peritonitis, type 2 (subacute) consists of localiza￾tion of fluid at the site of perforation, pericholecystic
abscess and localized peritonitis while type 3 (chronic)
comprises formation of internal or external fistulae [6].
Recent studies have cited higher rates of subacute or Type
2 perforations as compared to other types [7,8]. Our
patient had a type 1 gallbladder perforation because of
associated generalized biliary peritonitis.
In a study reporting the features of gall bladder perfora￾tion in 19 patients with acute cholecystitis, the mean age
of the patients was 69 years with a female: male ratio of
3:2. It was also seen in this study that most of the patients
had a history suggestive of gallbladder disease and had
medical co-morbidities such as cardiac, pulmonary, renal,

nutritional or metabolic diseases. The perforation
occurred in most of these patients within 72 hours [9].
According to other reports, perforation of the gallbladder
can occur as early as 2 days after the onset of acute chole￾cystitis, or after a few weeks [5,10].
Our case is unusual because our patient was younger in
comparison, had no prior history suggestive of gallblad￾der disease and had no known medical co-morbidity. His￾topathological examination of the specimen showed
features of acute-on-chronic cholecystitis leading to the
derivation that the prior episodes of cholecystitis in this
patient were clinically silent. Per-operatively our patient's
gallbladder showed dense adhesions with the surround￾ing structures and no signs of gangrene of the rest of the
gallbladder. This further strengthens the possibility of
clinically covert episodes of acute cholecystitis in the past
due to the adhesions noted; however the patient denied
any past history of abdominal pain. The gallbladder per￾foration in our case presumably occurred within the first
12-18 hours of the onset of symptoms. In addition, the
perforation occurred at the neck of the gallbladder which
is an uncommonly reported site for such an event. The
most common sites for the perforation of the gallbladder
are the fundus and the body of the gallbladder due to

poorer vascular supply of these areas as compared to the
neck of the gallbladder [11].
We initially performed an x-ray of the abdomen in this
patient. When no signs of pneumoperitoneum or intesti￾nal obstruction were demonstrated, a CT scan of the abdo￾men was performed. In a series of 17 patients with
gallbladder perforation who presented with an acute
abdomen, CT scan was the preliminary radiological inves￾tigation [7]. Sensitivity of CT in the detection of gallblad￾der perforation and biliary calculi has been reported to be
88% and 89%; these figures are higher than those
reported for ultrasonographic examination [7].
Early surgical intervention is an important step in the
management of gallbladder perforation. It is important to
be mindful that increased morbidity and mortality is asso￾ciated with this condition because of delay in diagnosis
and initiation of treatment.
Conclusion
Early diagnosis of gallbladder perforation and immediate
surgical intervention are of prime importance in decreas￾ing morbidity and mortality associated with this condi￾tion. The presence of risk factors certainly warrants an
aggressively oriented investigation stratagem to rule out
this serious complication. However, it is also important to
consider this condition as an important differential in
patients without any prior features or history of gallstone
disease but whose acute presentation may be indicative of
biliary pathology as was the case in this patient.
