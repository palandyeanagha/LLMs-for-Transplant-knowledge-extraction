Introduction
Ischemic acute renal failure (ARF) is the most com￾mon cause of intrinsic ARF in adults (1). In native kid￾neys, it is associated with an overall mortality rate of
up to 50% (2). Despite developments in dialysis treat￾ment, this mortality rate has not improved in the last
30 years (3). In transplant kidneys, ischemic injury
increases length of hospitalization and leads to
increased allograft loss (4).
Recently, leukocytes have been implicated in the
pathogenesis of renal ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI);
most of the work has focused on the role of the neu￾trophil (5). Evidence from several studies suggests,
however, that T cells could also be important leukocyte
mediators of renal IRI. Lymphocytes have been found
in postischemic human (6, 7) and rat (8) kidneys, par￾ticularly in the outer medulla. We recently found that
genetically engineered mice deficient in both CD4+ and
CD8+ lymphocytes had substantially less kidney dys￾function after renal ischemia than did wild-type con￾trol mice with renal IRI (9). T cells have also been found
to be important in the pathogenesis of IRI in other
organs (10). Importantly, the study of T cells in ARF is
a novel approach in this area of investigation, and
opens the potential of harnessing developments in 
T cell biology for novel ARF therapies.
We hypothesized that the T cell has an important role
in the pathogenesis of renal IRI, and sought to directly
identify which T cell subset might be more important.
The hypothesis was investigated with a redundant
approach using distinct strains of T cell–deficient mice
and adoptive transfer techniques. T cell–deficient
(nu/nu) mice were found to be protected from postis￾chemic renal injury, while nu/nu mice reconstituted
with wild-type T cells were found to have postischemic
renal injury similar to that in wild-type mice. To eluci￾date the primary T cell subset that is important in renal
IRI, mice deficient in CD4+ T cells alone or CD8+ T cells
alone were subjected to renal IRI. The CD4-deficient
mice had significantly improved recovery of renal func￾tion after ischemia compared with CD8-deficient mice
and wild-type control mice. Furthermore, CD4-defi￾cient mice reconstituted with CD4+ T cells had a
restoration of the postischemic injury phenotype. To
identify possible mechanisms involved in the protec￾tion from renal injury seen in the T cell–deficient mice,
we studied nu/nu mice that had been adoptively trans￾ferred with an enriched CD4+ T cell population
obtained from mice that were deficient in either CD28
(accessory molecule mediated pathway) or IFN-γ (to
distinguish between a possible Th1 versus a Th2
response). We found that both CD28 and IFN-γ are
important components of CD4+ T cell–mediated renal
injury following IRI, as neither defective CD4+ popula￾tion restored the postischemic injury phenotype.

Leukocytes have been implicated in the pathogenesis of ischemic acute renal failure (ARF), but the
roles of the individual cell types involved are largely unknown. Recent indirect evidence suggests that
T cells may play an important role in a murine model of ARF. In the current study, we found that mice
deficient in T cells (nu/nu mice) are both functionally and structurally protected from postischemic
renal injury. Reconstitution of nu/nu mice with wild-type T cells restored postischemic injury. We
then analyzed the contribution of the individual T cell subsets to postischemic injury and found that
mice deficient in CD4+ T cells, but not mice deficient in CD8+ T cells, were significantly protected
from ARF. Direct evidence for a pathophysiologic role of the CD4+ T cell was obtained when recon￾stitution of CD4-deficient mice with wild-type CD4+ T cells restored postischemic injury. In addition,
adoptive transfers of CD4+ T cells lacking either the costimulatory molecule CD28 or the ability to
produce IFN-γ were inadequate to restore injury phenotype. These results demonstrate that the CD4+
T cell is an important mediator of ischemic ARF, and targeting this cell may yield novel therapies.

mice homozygous for the nu/nu spontaneous mutation
(Foxn1nu, formerly Hfh11nu) are abnormal hair growth
and defective development of the thymic epithelium.
nu/nu mice are therefore athymic due to a developmen￾tal failure of the thymus. Consequently, homozygous
nu/nu mice lack T cells and cell-mediated immunity.
CD4-deficient mice (B6.129S2-Cd4tm1Mak), CD8-deficient
mice (B6.129S2-Cd8atm1Mak), CD28-deficient mice
(B6.129S2-Cd28tm1Mak), IFN-γ–deficient mice (B6.129S7-
Ifngtm1Ts), and wild-type littermates were also purchased
from The Jackson Laboratory. Mice were housed under
pathogen-free conditions, according to NIH guidelines.
To confirm knockout and adoptive transfer status,
spleens and lymph nodes from each group of mice were
collected upon sacrifice and analyzed for CD4+ and
CD8+ cells using flow cytometric analysis.
Renal ischemia reperfusion model. An established model
of renal IRI was used (9). Animals were anesthetized
with 75 mg/kg intraperitoneal sodium pentobarbital.
Abdominal incisions were made and the renal pedicles
were bluntly dissected. A microvascular clamp was
placed on both renal pedicles for 30 minutes. (An
ischemia time of 30 minutes was chosen because it pro￾duces a sublethal kidney injury with many similarities
to that seen in human IRI with acute tubular necrosis.)
During the procedure, animals were kept well hydrat￾ed with saline, and were kept at a constant temperature
(∼37°C). After the clamps were removed, the wounds
were sutured and the animals were allowed to recover.
Assessment of postischemic renal function. Blood samples
were obtained from the tail vein at 0, 24, 48, and 72
hours after ischemia. Serum creatinine (SCr) (mg/dl)
was measured on a Roche Cobas Fara automated sys￾tem (Roche, Nutley, New Jersey, USA) using a Creatinine
557 kit (Sigma Diagnostics, St. Louis, Missouri, USA).
Tissue histological examination. At 24 or 72 hours after
ischemia, kidneys were dissected from mice, and coro￾nal tissue slices were fixed in 10% formalin and
processed for histologic examination using standard
techniques. Formalin tissue was embedded in paraffin
and 4-µm sections were cut. Basement membranes and
other oxidizable structures containing 1,2-diol were
visualized using periodic acid–Schiff reagent. These
sections were examined in a blinded fashion by a
nephrologist and a pathologist to evaluate the degree
of tubular necrosis.
Immunohistochemistry. Tissue sections were prepared as
described above for routine histology. Sections (4 µm)
were prepared on a cryostat and mounted on Fisher
Superfrost Plus slides, fixed in ice-cold acetone for 1–2
minutes, and allowed to air dry. Sections were then
blocked with 1:100 normal rabbit serum in PBS con￾taining Vector Avidin DH (Vector Laboratories Inc.,
Burlingame, California, USA). The following primary
antibodies were then added to the sections: GK 1.5 (rat
anti-mouse CD4; American Type Culture Collection,
Manassas, Virginia, USA), GD 2.43 (rat anti-mouse
CD8; American Type Culture Collection), M1/70 (rat
anti-mouse MAC-1; Caltag Laboratories Inc.,
Burlingame, California, USA), and 7/4 (rat anti-mouse
neutrophil; Accurate Chemical & Scientific Corp., West￾bury, New York, USA). Sections were then incubated for
1 hour at room temperature. An isotype control pri￾mary antibody was used as a background staining con￾trol. Sections were then rinsed in PBS and treated with
3% hydrogen peroxide in biotin (10 µg/l PBS) to block
the biotin binding sites. After three washes in PBS, the

T cell–deficient mice are functionally protected from postischemic
renal injury. SCr was significantly reduced at 24 and 48 hours (*P <
0.05) after IRI in nu/nu mice (circles) compared with SCr in wild-type
control mice with IRI (squares). The injury phenotype was restored
when nu/nu mice were adoptively transferred with wild-type T cells (tri￾angles). Reconstituted nu/nu mice show a significantly higher SCr at 24
and 48 hours after ischemia (#P < 0.05) compared with nu/nu mice. In
all experiments, SCr (mg/dl) was measured from tail blood samples
obtained from animals at 0 (preischemia), 24, 48, and 72 hours after
moderate ischemia (30 minutes of bilateral clamping). T cell–trans￾ferred mice received 15 × 106 purified T cells (obtained from wild-type
control mice) intraperitoneally 3 weeks prior to ischemic injury.

slides were incubated with a biotin-conjugated rabbit
anti-rat IgG secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories
Inc.) for 35 minutes at room temperature. Sections were
once again washed, and were then incubated for 45 min￾utes in Vector Elite ABC (Vector Laboratories Inc.). Sec￾tions were washed and developed with 3-amino-9-ethyl￾carbazole, counterstained with hematoxylin, and
mounted using Glycergel (DAKO Corp., Carpinteria,
California, USA). After the entire kidney section was
viewed, ten high-powered (×40) fields were counted in
the area of the corticomedullary junction, and total
numbers of cells were quantified in a blinded fashion.
T cell adoptive transfer. Spleens and lymph nodes were
collected from C57BL/6 wild-type littermates, CD28-
deficient mice, and IFN-γ–deficient mice. Splenic cells
were collected by centrifugation, and the red blood cells
were removed by lysis in NH4Cl for 5 minutes. T cell
enrichment was performed using nylon wool column
chromatography. Briefly, sterile nylon wool–packed
columns were equilibrated in RPMI with 5% FCS, and
cells were incubated on the column for 1 hour at 37°C in
5% CO2. Nonadherent cells (predominantly T cells) were
then eluted in 15 ml of RPMI and collected by centrifu￾gation. The percentages of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were
assessed by flow cytometry before and after nylon wool
T cell–enrichment. Enriched T cells were then washed
three times in HBSS to remove serum from the prepara￾tion. Approximately 15 × 106 enriched T cells were inject￾ed intraperitoneally into each nu/nu mouse. IRI was
induced in the mice 3 weeks after transfer. The 3-week
timepoint was based on our preliminary studies in which
earlier timepoints had less efficient reconstitution.
Purified populations of CD4+ T cells were obtained
by negative selection of CD8+ T cells and B cells on an
immunoaffinity column according to the manufactur￾er’s specifications (cellect-plus kits; Cytovax Biotech￾nologies Inc., Alberta, Canada). Enriched CD4+ T cells
were eluted from each column, and approximately
5–10 × 106 cells were injected intraperitoneally. FACS
analysis was performed before and after column purifi￾cation to determine percentages of CD4+ and CD8+
cells in cell preparations. IRI was performed on the
mice 3 weeks after transfer.
FACS analysis. Postischemic spleens and/or lymph
nodes were crushed in 5 ml HBSS-2 using five strokes in
a glass homogenizer. Cells were collected by centrifuga￾tion at 250 g for 10 minutes. They were then resus￾pended in ammonium chloride/potassium buffer for 5
minutes to remove red blood cells. Cells were washed
three times with ice-cold HBSS-2 and filtered through
a 70-µm nylon screen to remove debris. For each analy￾sis, 106 cells were treated with an Fc block for 5 minutes,
and then stained with 0.5 µg R-PE rat anti-mouse CD4
(H129.19) antibody and FITC-conjugated anti-mouse
CD8b.2 (53-5.8) antibody or isotype controls (PharMin￾gen, San Diego, California, USA) for 1 hour on ice. Cells
were then washed twice, fixed in 1% formalin, and ana￾lyzed on a Epics XL flow cytometer using System II soft￾ware (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, California, USA).
Statistical analysis. Data are expressed as mean ± SE. Com￾parisons of group means were performed using 1-way
ANOVA with the Student-Newman-Keuls multiple group
comparison test. P < 0.05 was considered significant.

(black bars), and T cell–reconstituted nu/nu mice (gray bars). n = 6

T cell–reconstituted nu/nu mice (Figure 1b), the absence
of CD4+ cells in CD4-deficient mice (Figure 1c), and the
presence of CD4+ T cells in CD4-deficient mice that
were reconstituted with CD4+ cells (Figure 1d). CD4+
cells that were taken from mice deficient in either CD28
or IFN-γ were equivalent to wild-type cells in their abil￾ity to reconstitute after adoptive transfer. FACS analy￾sis was also used to determine the enrichment of T cells
in the adoptive transfer experiments. Nylon wool was
used to obtain an enriched population of T cells from a
lymphocyte cell preparation. FACS analysis performed
before enrichment on nylon wool showed CD4+ stain￾ing of 11.4%, and CD8+ staining of 7.75%. Following
nylon wool enrichment, these values were increased to
36.2% CD4+ stained cells and 39.7% CD8+ stained cells.
For the CD4+ adoptive transfer experiment, the cell
preparation before CD4+ column enrichment consisted
of 19.1% CD4+ cells. Column FACS analysis after CD4+
enrichment showed an increase of CD4+ cells to 71.8%.
T cell–deficient mice show a return of the injury phenotype
when adoptively transferred with an enriched T cell popula￾tion. To demonstrate the effect of T cell deficiency on
early renal dysfunction following IRI, we first evaluat￾ed postischemic renal function in nu/nu mice. These
mice underwent moderate renal ischemia (30 minutes
of renal artery clamping) and were monitored for 72
hours afterward. Postischemic renal function in nu/nu
mice and wild-type control mice is shown in Figure 2.
SCr was significantly reduced in the nu/nu mice com￾pared with wild-type control mice with IRI, both 24
hours (n = 8, 1.73 ± 0.19 vs. 2.86 ± 0.13, P < 0.05) and 48
hours (n = 8, 1.67 ± 0.15 vs. 2.7 ± 0.09, P < 0.05) after
ischemia. These data demonstrate that T cell–deficient
nu/nu mice had less renal dysfunction following IRI
than did wild-type control mice.
nu/nu mice are genetically mutant mice, and thus
may differ from wild-type control mice in ways other
than lack of T cells. To confirm that reduced ischemic
injury in nu/nu mice was due to the deficiency in T cells,
we investigated whether reconstituting nu/nu mice
with T cells from wild-type mice would return the renal
IRI phenotype. An adoptive transfer technique was
used to reconstitute the nu/nu mice with wild-type 
T cells. Postischemic renal function in the T cell–recon￾stituted nu/nu mice is also shown in Figure 2. A return
of the renal IRI phenotype is evident: SCr was signifi￾cantly elevated when compared with the nu/nu mice at
24 hours (n = 8, 1.73 ± 0.19 vs. 2.59 ± 0.24, P < 0.05) and
48 hours (n = 8, 1.67 ± 0.15 vs. 2.27 ± 0.25, P < 0.05)
after ischemia. Moreover, SCr in T cell–reconstituted
nu/nu mice with IRI was comparable to that in wild￾type control mice with renal IRI.
To investigate the extent of tubular necrosis in nu/nu
mice, we histologically examined kidney tissue at 24
and 72 hours after ischemia. nu/nu mice at 24 hours
after ischemia showed minimal tubular injury (data
not shown). We therefore compared 72-hour postis￾chemic tissue. Representative photomicrographs are
shown in Figure 3. Normal kidney (no IRI) is repre￾sented in Figure 3a. Kidneys from wild-type mice at 72
hours after ischemia (Figure 3b) exhibited significant
tubular injury, characterized by extensive tubular
epithelial necrosis and sloughing of epithelial cells into
the tubular lumen. Many of the tubules were dilated.
Tubules also contained proteinaceous casts. Kidneys
from nu/nu mice (Figure 3c) had less tubular injury
than did kidneys from wild-type control mice (Figure
3b) at 72 hours. In nu/nu mice, a few tubules showed
dilation with proteinaceous material in the lumen.
nu/nu mice that were reconstituted with T cells (Figure
3d) had more severe tubular injury at 72 hours, similar
to that seen in wild-type mice, with many tubules
exhibiting dilation and congestion with proteinaceous
material, as well as a loss of epithelial cell structure.

between wild-type mice (white bars), nu/nu mice (black bars), and 
T cell–reconstituted nu/nu mice (gray bars). n = 6 per group.

argued otherwise (5). We quantified the infiltrating neu￾trophils with a specific antibody at 24 and 72 hours after
ischemia in wild-type control, nu/nu, and T cell–recon￾stituted nu/nu mice; the results are represented in Figure
4. Our results show significant neutrophil infiltration in
both wild-type, nu/nu, and T cell–reconstituted nu/nu
mice. Thus in the current study, it does not appear that
neutrophil infiltration into the kidney is correlated with
T cell–mediated renal injury. We also analyzed the infil￾tration of macrophages into the postischemic kidney.
Macrophage infiltration, prominent after ischemia, was
also not significantly different between the T cell–defi￾cient nu/nu mice and wild-type controls (Figure 5).
CD4-deficient mice are functionally and structurally pro￾tected from IRI. After demonstrating a direct role for T
cells in our model of renal IRI, we focused on identify￾ing the important T cell subset involved in the patho￾genesis of renal IRI. Mice deficient in either CD4+ T
cells alone or CD8+ T cells alone were subjected to renal
IRI, and postischemic structure and function were ana￾lyzed. SCr values at 24, 48, and 72 hours after ischemia
are shown in Figure 6. CD4-deficient mice had signifi￾cantly decreased SCr compared with wild-type control
mice at each timepoint after ischemia (n = 8, P < 0.05).
CD4-deficient mice also had significantly decreased
SCr compared with CD8-deficient mice at 24 hours 
(n = 8, 2.67 ± 0.12 vs. 3.48 ± 0.14, P < 0.05) and 48 hours
(2.3 ± 0.1 vs. 2.89 ± 0.19, P < 0.05) after ischemia. In con￾trast, CD8-deficient mice did not show significant
improvement in renal function after ischemia com￾pared with wild-type control mice. CD4-deficient mice
were also significantly protected from mortality fol￾lowing renal IRI. CD4-deficient mice showed 88% sur￾vival compared with 20% in wild-type controls at 72
hours after ischemia (P < 0.05) (data not shown). Taken
together, these results demonstrate that it is the CD4+
T cell that is an important T cell subset involved in the
pathogenesis of renal injury following IRI.
To verify that the lack of CD4+ T cells was responsible
for protection from renal IRI, we adoptively transferred
CD4+ T cells from wild-type control littermates into
CD4-deficient mice. SCr values for these mice are shown
in Figure 7. CD4-deficient mice were significantly pro￾tected compared with wild-type mice at each timepoint
(n = 8, P < 0.05). The transfer of CD4+ T cells into CD4-
deficient mice restored the IRI phenotype, with a sig￾nificant increase in SCr at 72 hours after ischemia com￾pared with that in CD4-deficient mice (n = 8, 1.06 ± 0.07
vs. 1.95 ± 0.25, P < 0.05).
Histological assessment of tubular necrosis demon￾strated that the CD4-deficient mice had reduced renal
structural injury. Figure 8a shows a wild-type (no IRI)
kidney. At 24 hours after ischemia there was already
distinct protection from structural injury seen in CD4-
deficient mouse kidneys (Figure 8c) compared with
wild-type control mouse kidneys (Figure 8b). In con￾trast, the CD8-deficient mouse kidneys at 24 hours
after ischemia (Figure 8d) showed injury similar to that
in the wild-type control mice.
Leukocyte infiltration into the postischemic kidney of CD4-

were similar to those obtained for the T cell–deficient
nu/nu mouse experiments, demonstrating no signifi￾cant difference in the amount of infiltrating neu￾trophils and macrophages between these groups.

5–10 × 106 purified T cells (obtained from wild-type control mice)
intraperitoneally 3 weeks prior to ischemic injury.

T cell in influencing the course of renal IRI, we stained
postischemic kidney tissue to evaluate a potential infil￾tration of CD4+ T cells. CD4+ T cell staining is abundant
in spleens (Figure 11a), and is represented by a brown
stained ring around positive cells. Figure 11b shows a
normal (no IRI) wild-type kidney showing no positive
staining for CD4+ T cells. Neither the CD4-deficient nor
nu/nu mice showed any positive staining for CD4+ T
cells in postischemic kidney. However, the wild-type kid￾ney 24 hours after ischemia (Figure 11c) did show a
small number of CD4+ T cells in the outer medulla.
The role of CD28 and IFN-γ in T cell–mediated renal IRI.
To begin to explore the mechanism of how CD4+ T cells
mediate renal IRI, we studied nu/nu mice that had been
adoptively transferred with an enriched CD4+ T cell
population obtained from mice that were deficient in
either CD28 (accessory molecule mediated pathway) or
IFN-γ (to distinguish between a possible Th1 versus a
Th2 response). Figure 12 demonstrates the successful
adoptive transfer of nu/nu mice with CD4+ T cells from
CD28-deficient mice (Figure 12b) and IFN-γ–deficient
mice (Figure 12c). Numbers of CD4+ cells and CD8+
cells in wild-type mice are shown in Figure 12a. Postis￾chemic renal function in nu/nu mice adoptively trans￾ferred with CD4+ T cells from CD28- and IFN-γ–defi￾cient mice is represented in Figure 13. Wild-type mice
show an increase in SCr, as previously demonstrated.
Also as previously found, nu/nu mice had a significant
reduction in SCr compared with wild-type mice. Adop￾tive transfer of nu/nu mice with CD4+ T cells from
either CD28-deficient mice or IFN-γ–deficient mice
caused no increase in SCr compared with nu/nu mice.
Thus, adoptive transfer of T cells from either CD28-
deficient or IFN-γ–deficient mice did not produce a
return of the injury phenotype.
Discussion
The current study provides direct evidence that T cells
are mediators of renal IRI in mice, and that the CD4+ T
cell is the major T cell subset responsible for renal
injury following ischemia. Furthermore, the patho￾physiologic role of the CD4+ T cell is dependent on
CD28 and IFN-γ. These results, though novel in the
kidney, are consistent with emerging studies in other
organ systems. CD4+ T cells have been shown to medi￾ate murine liver ischemic injury in studies of T
cell–deficient mice (10). A recent study in a model of
gut ischemia reperfusion showed that reconstitution
of T cell–deficient mice with T cell–enriched spleno￾1288 The Journal of Clinical Investigation | November 2001 | Volume 108 | Number 9

cytes allowed mice to respond to gut ischemia reperfu￾sion in a manner similar to that seen in wild-type mice
(11). Using techniques similar to those used in our
study, a recent study in a liver model of cold ischemia
reperfusion showed that tissue injury was reduced by
51% in nu/nu mice, and that injury was restored by T
cell transfer into nu/nu mice (12).
A potential limitation in the use of mutant mice is
that physiologic and structural changes observed in IRI
could be due to abnormalities independent of the one
being studied. To confirm that T cell deficiency was
responsible for reduced renal IRI, we used an adoptive
transfer technique to reconstitute both the T cell–defi￾cient mice and the CD4-deficient mice with their respec￾tive T cell populations. An important and intriguing
finding of the present study was that a return of the
injury phenotype in T cell–deficient mice was accom￾plished with a small degree of T cell reconstitution.
Indeed, a splenic reconstitution of T cells of just 2–6%
was sufficient to restore renal dysfunction and damage.
All T cell–transferred populations were verified by FACS
analysis both prior to cell transfer and at the conclusion
of the experiment to ensure a minimal effect of con￾taminating cells. We cannot completely exclude the pos￾sibility that contaminating cells may have been involved
in the restoration of the injury phenotype; however, the
inability of CD4+ T cell transfers from CD28- and IFN￾γ–deficient mice to restore the injury phenotype make
it unlikely that contaminating cells are playing a signif￾icant role. While our results indicate that CD4+ T cells
are important to the pathogenesis of ischemic ARF, they
do not exclude the possible contribution of other T cells
(e.g., CD8+ cells) to the development of IRI. The present
results, however, indicate that these cells are probably
not the main mediators of early IRI.
The mechanism by which CD4+ T cells might induce
postischemic renal injury is not known; two potential
pathways were studied. CD4+ T cells from CD28-defi￾cient mice were adoptively transferred into nu/nu mice
to determine whether accessory molecule expression
was important in T cell–mediated renal IRI. Our results
suggest that CD28 is important in the pathogenesis of
renal IRI: our experiments showed that adoptive trans￾fer of nu/nu mice with CD4+ T cells deficient in CD28
was unable to restore injury. A potential role for CD28
was hypothesized by Takada et al., who demonstrated
that use of CTLA4Ig, which can block CD28 binding to
CD80, is protective in a rat model of cold renal IRI (13).
We also examined the effects of reconstituting nu/nu
mice with CD4+ T cells from IFN-γ–deficient mice. This
experiment was designed to determine whether CD4+
T cell–mediated renal IRI was associated primarily with
a Th1 or a Th2 response. We found that IFN-γ–defi￾cient CD4+ T cells did not restore injury in nu/nu mice.
This suggests that the Th1 polarization of CD4+ cells
might be more important in mediating renal IRI. It also
suggests that IFN-γ may play an important role in the
regulation of the early injury response to IRI.
T cell activation in renal IRI would not be conven￾tionally expected. Classically, T cell activation is
thought to require foreign antigens bound to self￾MHC molecules, together with costimulatory signals
by antigen-presenting cells. Nonetheless, T cell activa￾tion and the production of associated cytokines have
been described in experimental renal IRI (5, 8, 14). The
absence of foreign antigens in renal IRI leads us to
speculate that alloantigen-independent T cell activa￾tion may be involved in renal IRI. In this regard, hypox￾ia itself might be sufficient for T cell activation. CD4+

tion (15). Recently, it has also been suggested that
increased adhesion of infiltrating T cells to renal tubu￾lar epithelial cells under hypoxic conditions may pro￾vide a potential mechanism underlying postischemic
tubular dysfunction (9). The danger signals activated
in renal IRI could thus activate the CD4+ T cell and lead
it to function in more of an innate manner, rather than
in its classical adaptive immunologic role. (16, 17).
Localization of T cells in the kidney would help eluci￾date the mechanism of T cell–induced renal dysfunc￾tion. However, immunohistochemistry with specific
antibodies to CD4+ T cells demonstrated a paucity of T
cell infiltration into the postischemic kidney. It may be
possible that only a small number of infiltrating T cells,
relative to the amount of neutrophil or macrophage
infiltration, is sufficient to exert an effect. Alternative￾ly, the T cells could be orchestrating an effect on renal
injury from a distant site, possibly via soluble cytokines.
In view of previous work suggesting an important
role of neutrophils in renal IRI (18, 19), we investigat￾ed in this study the effect of T cell manipulation on
neutrophil infiltration. We have previously used meth￾ods such as Leder staining and myeloperoxidase assays
to identify neutrophils (20, 21). A recent study, howev￾er, has shown that these techniques also detect
macrophages, and are nonspecific (22). Therefore, in
the current study, we used a specific monoclonal anti￾body to neutrophils to detect their infiltration into
postischemic kidney tissue. Brisk neutrophil infiltra￾tion to the corticomedullary junction after ischemia
was observed in both wild-type mice with full expres￾sion of renal injury, and in T cell–manipulated mice
that were protected. Similarly, we found significant
macrophage infiltration after ischemia, with little dif￾ference between wild-type and T cell–deficient groups.
Therefore we cannot clearly identify regulation of neu￾trophil or macrophage infiltration as the mechanism
by which T cells participate in this model. This finding,
however, does not exclude a possible effect of neu￾trophils or macrophages, independent of mere tissue
infiltration, in renal IRI. In a previous study that eval￾uated leukocyte migration in experimental asthma, we
found that leukocyte blockade can protect tissue struc￾ture and function despite not attenuating leukocyte
migration and infiltration (23, 24).
This study demonstrates the important role for CD4+T
cells in renal IRI, using redundant approaches including
the use of spontaneous T cell–deficient mice, targeted T
cell–deficient mice, mice with targeted T cell dysfunction,
and adoptive transfer techniques. Although many under￾lying mechanisms still need to be elucidated, our current
data support studies in humans targeting CD4+T cells in
renal IRI, particularly in the transplant patient.
