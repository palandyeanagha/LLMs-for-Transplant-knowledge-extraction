Abstract
Specific mutations in the UL97 region of human cytomegalo￾virus (HCMV) have been found to confer resistance to labo￾ratory-adapted strains subjected to ganciclovir selection. In
this study, mutations in the UL97 region of HCMV isolates
obtained from patients receiving ganciclovir therapy were
examined to determine whether they would confer gan￾ciclovir resistance, and if these mutations could be detected
directly in the plasma of AIDS patients with progressive
HCMV disease despite ganciclovir treatment. A single nucle￾otide change within a conserved region of UL97 was found
in five resistant isolates, resulting in an amino acid substitu￾tion in residue 595: from leucine to phenylalanine in one,
and from leucine to serine in four resistant isolates. A sixth
resistant isolate demonstrated a single nucleotide change,
leading to a threonine to isoleucine substitution in residue
659. The role of the 595 amino acid substitution in confer￾ring ganciclovir resistance was confirmed by marker trans￾fer experiments. In further studies, direct sequencing of
HCMV DNA present in plasma obtained from persons with
resistant viruses revealed the identical amino acid substitu￾tions in plasma as those present in the cultured viruses.
These findings indicate that clinical resistance to ganciclovir
can result from specific point mutations in the UL97 gene,
and that the emergence of the resistant genotype can be
detected directly in patient plasma. (J. Clin. Invest. 1995.

Introduction
The management of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV)' disease
in persons with AIDS often requires continuous lifelong treat￾ment with ganciclovir. However, prolonged therapy may lead
to the development of clinical resistance to ganciclovir, mani￾fested by disease progression and associated with the recovery

of in vitro resistant strains ( 1, 2). Resistance in clinical isolates
has been phenotypically associated with impaired ganciclovir
phosphorylation in infected cells (3). However, the genotypic
basis for clinical ganciclovir resistance has not been resolved.
Recently, it has been shown that ganciclovir phosphorylation
in infected cells is controlled by the product of the HCMV UL97
open reading frame, a protein kinase homologue by sequence
analysis (4, 5). Regions in the predicted product corresponding
to conserved catalytic subdomains implicated in nucleotide
binding, phosphotransfer, and substrate recognition have been
identified on the basis of sequence homology (6, 7), and a
mutation conferring resistance to ganciclovir has been mapped
to the UL97 gene in a laboratory-derived strain (5). However,
the development of mutations within the UL97 region have not
been demonstrated to occur in HCMV strains isolated from
persons receiving ganciclovir therapy. Thus, the initial objective
of this study was to characterize the genotypes of clinical
HCMV isolates associated with ganciclovir resistance.
Having established that mutations within conserved sites of
the UL97 gene confer clinical ganciclovir resistance, the pres￾ence of these specific mutations in clinical specimens was exam￾ined. Because we have recently demonstrated that HCMV DNA
is present in the plasma of immunocompromised patients with
active infection and disease (8-10), we sought to determine if
UL97 gene mutations could be detected directly in the plasma
of persons with clinically resistant HCMV retinitis. Our findings
demonstrate that the identical resistant genotypes are present in
plasma, and that plasma can be used as an easily accessible
clinical specimen for the determination of HCMV mutations
known to confer phenotypic ganciclovir resistance.
Methods
Study patients and clinical specimens. Persons with AIDS and HCMV
retinitis who were treated at the University of California, San Diego
(UCSD) Treatment Center were followed with physical examination
and ophthalmologic evaluation for a minimum of 6 mo or until death.
Buffy-coat and urine cultures for HCMV were performed before initia￾tion of ganciclovir therapy and at least monthly during therapy. Sequen￾tial plasma samples were separated from the same heparinized blood
specimens obtained for culture. 10 epidemiologically unrelated patients
(patients 1-10) were selected on the basis of clinical resistance to
ganciclovir therapy. The patients received an initial induction course of
intravenous ganciclovir (5 mg/kg twice daily) followed by maintenance
therapy of intravenous ganciclovir (5 mg/kg daily). Clinical resistance
was defined as the presence of new HCMV disease activity or progres￾sion of retinitis despite administration of ganciclovir at induction doses
for at least 8 wk, as previously described (11 ). Excluded were patients
with poor compliance or with acute HIV-related concurrent opportunis￾tic disease. Two persons, patient 1 and patient 8, had their therapy
changed to foscarnet after 7 and 8 mo, respectively.
Cells and viruses. Human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF) were used
for propagation of wild-type and clinical isolates, and for transfection
experiments. Cell monolayers were grown in DME supplemented with

HCMV strains AD169 and Towne were obtained from the American
Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Virus stocks were main￾tained at -70'C as cell-free virus with 1% DMSO. Urine and buffy￾coat specimens for culture were processed as previously described ( 12,
13) by the UCSD Medical Center Viral Diagnostic Laboratory. HCMV
clinical isolates were further propagated in HFF cells, and maintained
as low passage cell-associated stocks in liquid nitrogen with 20% fetal
bovine serum and 10% DMSO. Late therapy isolates were recovered
from patients 1-3, 6, 9, and 10 after 4-10 mo of ganciclovir therapy.
For two of the patients, pretherapy isolates were available. For patient
8, an isolate recovered 6 mo after cessation of ganciclovir treatment
was available for study.
Seven additional clinical isolates were evaluated from patients who
responded to therapy. In addition, two previously characterized late￾therapy ganciclovir resistant strains ( 1), designated as resistant isolates
(RI) 4 and 5, which demonstrated impaired phosphorylation in vitro
(3), were originally isolated by Erice et al. (1) and obtained from K.
Biron (Burroughs Wellcome Co., Research Triangle Park, NC). These
viruses were sequenced as reference viruses. Low passage isolates of
interest were further plaque purified using cell-free virus supernatant to
yield genetically pure strains. Recombinant viruses were maintained
both as cell-free and cell-associated virus.
Antiviral drug susceptibility assays. Ganciclovir was obtained from
Syntex Research (Palo Alto, CA) and foscarnet was obtained from
Astra Pharmaceutical Products Inc. (Westborough, MA). Drugs were
stored as a 10,000 pM stock solution at -20'C. In vitro sensitivity
phenotypes were determined by the plaque reduction assay and/or by the
Hybriwixtm DNA-DNA probe hybridization assay (Diagnostic Hybrids
Inc., Athens, OH) in 24-well plates, as previously described (14, 15).
The laboratory-adapted HCMV strain, AD169, was included as a sensi￾tive control with each assay. Assays were performed simultaneously for
sets of isolates recovered from patients who either responded to gan￾ciclovir or who were clinically unresponsive to ganciclovir treatment.
Sensitivity assays were repeated two or more times for each isolate
and expressed as mean values of ED50 (14, 15). HCMV strains were
considered sensitive to ganciclovir if the ED50 was c 6 pLM, and resistant
if the ED50 was 12 pM.
Amplification and sequencing of the UL97 catalytic domain in viral
isolates and in plasma. DNA was extracted from 75-cm2 flasks of HFF
infected with each virus when 50% cytopathic effect was observed,
using the IsoQuick nucleic acid extraction kit (Microprobe Corp., Gar￾den Grove, CA). 1 pg of total cellular DNA was used as a template

for each PCR. Plasma samples obtained from heparinized blood were
maintained at -20OC until assayed. 10 ,uI of 1:10 plasma dilution (total
of 1 pl of plasma per reaction) was freeze-thawed three times, dissolved
in 1 x PCR buffer (50 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, [pH 8.3], and 2
mM MgCl2), and incubated with proteinase K (120 pg/ml; Sigma
Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) at 600C for 1 h. Samples were then
heated at 950C for 10 min, centrifuged for 5 min at 12,000 g, and
directly amplified by PCR.
To sequence the catalytic domain homologous region (nucleotides
812-2148), the region was divided into seven overlapping DNA seg￾ments ranging from 238 to 284 base pairs, which were amplified by PCR.
A schematic diagram showing the location of the amplified fragments in
relation to the catalytic subdomains corresponding regions is shown in
Fig. 1. The primers defining the fragments were designed using the
published AD169 sequence (6). The sequences of the primers, and the
fragments amplified are shown in Table I.
To amplify each fragment, the template was combined with the
appropriate primer pair (50 pmol each), deoxyribonucleoside triphos￾phates (200 pM each, Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology Inc., Piscataway,
NJ), and Taq polymerase (2.5 U; Perkin-Elmer Corp., Norwalk, CT)
in a total of 100 p1 1 x PCR buffer, and amplified by 35 cycles of
denaturation at 940C for 15 s, annealing at 550C for 15 s, and extension
at 72°C for 1 min in the Gene Amp PCR system 9600 (Perkin-Elmer
Corp.). To avoid false positive signals all reactions were performed
under stringent conditions (9). Buffer controls and control samples were
run along with test samples in each reaction. When a positive signal
was detected, PCR products were resolved by gel electrophoresis and
purified from low melting point agarose gel using the magic PCR preps
DNA purification system (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). From the
PCR product, 1-5 ng were subjected to direct PCR sequencing ac￾cording to the Sanger dideoxy termination method (16), using the fmol
DNA sequencing system (Promega Corp.). The same primers designed
to amplify the fragments were end-labeled with 33P (Dupont-NEN, Bos￾ton, MA) and used to sequence the sense and antisense strands. Cycle
parameters for the sequencing reaction were chosen according to the
manufacturer's specifications. Sequence changes were confirmed by se￾quencing both strands of at least two independent PCR products for
each fragment. Under the conditions of this assay, 10-50 genome copies
in the sample were sufficient to yield a clear sequence within 48 h.
Marker transfer experiments. To prepare infectious Towne strain
DNA, HFF were infected with Towne strain at a multiplicity of infection
of 0.01. Once a generalized cytopathic effect was observed, cells were
scraped into the medium, pelleted by low speed centrifugation for 15
min at 4°C, and resuspended in 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 10 mM EDTA,
followed by incubation with 1% SDS and 250 pg/ml proteinase K
(Sigma Chemical Co.) at 37°C for S h. DNA was extracted twice with
phenol chloroform:isoamyl alcohol, once with ether, isopropanol precip￾itated, gently removed from solution, and resuspended in 10 mM Tris,
10 mM EDTA.
Low passage HFF cells (passage 5-10) in 6-well plates were
cotransfected with 1 pg Towne strain infectious DNA (5 PFUI/pg) and
with PCR-derived fragments containing the indicated mutations, which
were prepared as described above, and used in 5-10-fold molar excess
relative to the homologous sequence found in Towne strain DNA. Con￾258 D. G. Wolf L. L. Smith, D. J. Lee, W. R. Freeman, M. Flores-Aguilar, and S. A. Spector

trol wells were transfected with Towne strain DNA alone. The DNA
was combined with 10 jig lipofectin reagent (GIBCO BRL, Gaithers￾burg, MD) in Opti-MEM I reduced serum media as specified by the
manufacturer. Cells were incubated with the transfection mixture for 18
h, after which the media was changed to regular maintenance media.
Cells were examined daily for the appearance of plaques. Once a gener￾alized cytopathic effect was achieved, cells and supernatant progeny
virus were harvested. The titer of the progeny virus was determined in
the absence of drug and in the presence of 1, 5, 10, 25, and 50 jM
ganciclovir. For selection of recombinant viruses, progeny virus was
propagated in the presence of 20 AM ganciclovir. Supernatant virus was
then plaque purified twice and further propagated without drug selection.
Results
Antiviral drug susceptibility profiles of clinical isolates. ED50s
for antiviral drugs, as determined by the plaque reduction assay
and by the DNA-DNA probe hybridization assay, maintained
similar absolute values. Ganciclovir ED,,s for the pretherapy
sensitive isolates, recovered from seven patients who responded
to ganciclovir therapy, designated as Sen. 1 1-7, ranged be￾tween 2 and 6 AM. ED,,s for the resistant late therapy isolates,
designated RI 1-6, ranged between 19 and 34 MM. For patient
3 and patient 6, pretherapy isolates were available for assay
with ED5o's of 2 and 6 MM, respectively. Late-therapy isolates
from patient 9 and patient 10 were ganciclovir sensitive. All
the clinical isolates examined remained foscarnet sensitive with
ED50s ranging between 70 and 400 AM, except for one isolate,
RI-l, which demonstrated a foscarnet ED50 of 1,100 MM and
was, therefore, considered resistant to both drugs.
Sequence analysis in the clinical isolates. To identify muta￾tions conferring resistance to ganciclovir, we determined the
nucleotide sequence of the UL97 catalytic domain homologous
region in AD169 and Towne laboratory strains, and in 13 clini￾cal isolates. Sequence analysis revealed a limited sequence di￾versity among clinical isolates with a closer sequence pattern
between the Towne strain and the clinical isolates, as compared
with the AD169 strain. When compared to the AD169 strain
sequence, the Towne strain and the clinical isolates demon￾strated a number of common silent nucleotide substitutions: at
position 972 (T to C substitution) in Towne strain and 13
clinical isolates, at position 1167 (C to T) in Towne strain, at
position 1368 (C to T) in 5 clinical isolates, at position 1509
(T to C) in Towne strain and in 9 clinical isolates, at position
1575 (C to T) in 2 clinical isolates, at position 1657 (C to T)
in 6 clinical isolates, at position 1737 (C to T) in 7 clinical
isolates, at position 1794 (T to C) in Towne strain and 13
clinical isolates, at position 1902 (G to A) in 7 clinical isolates,
at position 2064 (C to T) in 2 clinical isolates and at position
2106 (C to T) in 6 clinical isolates.
In addition to the above changes, which did not result in
amino acid substitutions, a single nucleotide change was found
in each of five resistant isolates (Fig. 2 a): a G to T substitution
at position 1785 in one resistant isolate, RI-i, and a T to C
substitution at position 1784 in four resistant isolates, RI 2-5.
The two adjacent nucleotide changes both resulted in an amino
acid substitution at position 595 (position 643 according to the
aligned sequence published by M. Chee et al. [6]): from leucine
to phenylalanine in RI-1, and from leucine to serine in RI 2-
5 (Table II). Amino acid 595 is located within a conserved
region, corresponding to catalytic subdomain IX (6, 7). A pre￾therapy ganciclovir-sensitive isolate, available for comparison
with RI-3, did not contain the 595 residue substitution.
RI-3 demonstrated a sequence mixture containing an addi￾tional C to T substitution at position 1781. This change resulted
in an alanine to valine substitution at position 594. In two
resistant isolates, two single nucleotide changes were found
further downstream (Fig. 2 b): a G to A substitution at position

1993 in RI-4, resulting in a valine to isoleucine substitution at
position 665, and a C to T substitution at position 1976 in RI￾6, resulting in a threonine to isoleucine substitution at position
659 (Table II). These substituted amino acids are located in
a region corresponding to catalytic subdomain XI. A mixed
pretherapy sensitive isolate (sen I), available for comparison
with RI-6, did not contain the 659 residue substitution. How￾ever, a sensitive plaque-purified strain obtained from the mixed
pretherapy isolate did contain the 659 residue substitution, sug￾gesting that this mutation did not play a role in the development
of ganciclovir resistance.
To further distinguish mutations associated with resistance
from interstrain viral polymorphism, we sequenced seven addi￾tional ganciclovir-sensitive isolates. While none of these pa￾tients' isolates demonstrated the 595 residue mutation, two (sen
I-1 and sen 1-2) contained nucleotide changes at position 1781
(C to T) and at position 1809 (C to G), which resulted in an
alanine to valine substitution at position 594 and in cysteine to
tryptophan substitution at position 603, respectively (Fig. 2 c
and Table II). These changes, which did not confer resistance
in vitro, may indicate the specificity of the substrate recognition
process.
Marker transfer of the mutation to wild-type strain. To ex￾amine the role of the 595 residue mutations in conferring gan￾ciclovir resistance, marker transfer experiments were per￾formed. Low passage fibroblasts were cotransfected with infec￾tious Towne strain DNA and with PCR-derived fragments
containing the 595 residue mutations (prepared as described
in Methods). Plaques appeared after 7-14 d, and supernatant
progeny virus was harvested when generalized cytopathic effect
was observed. Ganciclovir susceptibility assays of progeny vi￾rus recovered from cells cotransfected with the 595 leucine to
serine substitution-containing fragment, and from cells cotrans￾fected with the 595 leucine to phenylalanine substitution-con￾taining fragment, revealed a 3-6-fold increase in ganciclovir
ED50 relative to progeny virus recovered from cells transfected
with Towne strain DNA alone (Fig. 3). The increase in gan￾ciclovir ED50 suggested an efficient transfer of ganciclovir resis￾tance by the fragments containing both 595 residue mutations.
A recombinant virus was subsequently selected in the presence
of ganciclovir and further plaque purified twice in the absence
of drug. Sequence analysis of the recombinant confirmed the
presence of the G to T substitution at position 1785, causing a
leucine to phenylalanine substitution at position 595. Gan￾ciclovir susceptibility assay of the recombinant virus revealed
an ED50 of 33 MM, a value comparable to that of the parental

to phenylalanine substitution in conferring clinical ganciclovir
resistance was confirmed. Whereas RI-1 was cross-resistant to
foscarnet, the recombinant virus remained foscarnet sensitive.
Sequence analysis in plasma. The nucleotide sequence of
the UL97 catalytic domain was determined by direct PCR se￾quencing in sequential plasma specimens obtained from 10 per￾sons with AIDS and clinically resistant HCMV retinitis. To
examine the utility of direct genotypic analysis in plasma for
determining drug resistance, the findings were correlated with
the nucleotide sequence and the in vitro drug susceptibility
phenotypes of the corresponding viral isolates. Plasma obtained
from patient 1, patient 2, and patient 3 after 7, 5, and 4 mo of
therapy, respectively, contained the same nucleotide changes
found in the corresponding ganciclovir-resistant viral isolates
(Fig. 4) resulting in a substitution of the leucine residue at
position 595 by phenylalanine or serine (Table III). Patient
3 demonstrated a sequence mixture leading to an additional
substitution at position 594, also detected in the viral isolate.
Pretherapy specimens of patient 2 and patient 3, who initially
excreted ganciclovir-sensitive virus, contained wild-type se￾quences. In patient 4, a mixture of wild-type sequences and an
alanine to valine substitution at position 594 was detected after
7 mo of ganciclovir therapy. Patient 5 had one plasma sample
available for assay, obtained after 37 mo of ganciclovir treat￾ment; this specimen demonstrated a C to T substitution at posi￾tion 1772 with an alanine to valine substitution at residue 591.
Patient 6 plasma contained the same 659-threonine to isoleucine
substitution demonstrated in the viral isolate. Patient 7 and pa￾tient 8 each had plasma that contained a single nucleotide substi￾tution in subdomain VI corresponding region, within the pro￾posed nucleotide binding site: a G to A change at position 1380
and an A to G change at position 1378, resulting in a substitution
of the methionine residue at position 460 by isoleucine and
valine, respectively (see Table III). Patient 9 and patient 10,

the course of therapy, maintained wild-type UL97 sequences
within their plasma and the corresponding viral isolates.
In two persons, patient 1 and patient 8, the clinical decision
was made to discontinue ganciclovir and to institute foscarnet
therapy. A plasma sample obtained 6 mo after cessation of
ganciclovir therapy in patient 8, while still receiving foscamet,
contained HCMV DNA which demonstrated apparent complete
reversion of the mutation back to wild type. An isolate from a
leukocyte culture obtained concomitantly was ganciclovir sensi￾tive (Table III). In contrast, patient 1 had persistence of the
595 mutation in plasma 9 mo after cessation of ganciclovir
therapy, suggesting a potential for stability of resistant variants
in vivo despite the absence of selective pressure. In patient 1
and patient 3, mutations appeared in plasma in conjunction with
culture isolation of resistant viral isolate. In patient 2, the 595
mutation was detected in plasma 1 mo before resistant virus
could be cultured from the patient (Table III).
Discussion
HCMV resistance to ganciclovir has been estimated to occur in
8% of persons with AIDS receiving maintenance therapy for
more than 3 mo (2). With the improved survival of HIV-in￾fected people with CD4+ lymphocyte counts below 50/mm3
and HCMV retinitis, prolonged ganciclovir therapy with the
emergence of ganciclovir resistance is likely to become increas￾ingly common. Current studies of clinical gancoclovir resistance
rely on in vitro drug susceptibility testing of viral isolates recov￾ered from patients during therapy. In this study we have deter￾mined the nucleotide sequence of the UL97 catalytic domain
homologous region in ganciclovir-resistant and ganciclovir-sen￾sitive clinical isolates, and employed marker transfer experi￾ments to resolve the molecular basis of clinical ganciclovir
resistance. The in vitro appearance of UL97 mutations associ￾ated with ganciclovir resistance was then directly examined
in plasma from patients exhibiting disease progression during
therapy. Sequence analysis revealed a single nucleotide change
at adjacent positions in each of five epidemiologically unrelated
resistant isolates (Fig. 2). The two adjacent base changes both
resulted in amino acid substitution at position 595: from leucine
to phenylalanine in one resistant isolate and from leucine to
serine in four resistant isolates. The 595 leucine, conserved in
herpes simplex virus type I and varicella-zoster virus, lies within
a putative substrate recognition and binding site (5, 6, 17-20).
A role for this hydrophobic epitope in substrate recognition in
HCMV has been suggested by the mapping of a ganciclovir
resistance mutation to a deletion of residues 590-593 in a labo￾ratory-derived strain (5).
To examine the role of the 595 leucine substitution in the
development of clinical resistance, marker transfer experiments
were performed. Both 595 substitutions efficiently transferred
ganciclovir resistance to a wild-type strain. A recombinant virus
containing the leucine to phenylalanine substitution displayed
the same ganciclovir resistance profile as the parental isolate.
While the parental isolate demonstrated cross-resistance to fos￾carnet, suggesting an additional mutation in the viral DNA poly￾merase, the recombinant virus maintained the wild-type foscar￾net susceptibility profile, thus confirming the role of the 595
substitution in conferring clinical ganciclovir resistance, and
separating the molecular basis of resistance to ganciclovir and
foscarnet in the parental isolate. Direct sequence analysis of the
viral DNA in plasma from patients whose HCMV strains were
ganciclovir resistant revealed the same amino acid substitutions
at position 595, appearing after 4-7 mo of ganciclovir therapy.
An adjacent alanine to valine substitution at position 594 was
detected in one patient's plasma and appeared during the course
of therapy in another, in conjunction with the 595 leucine substi￾tution. However, the contribution of the 594 alanine substitution
by itself to the development of resistance remained unclear,
because the ED50 for the corresponding mixed isolate containing
the two substitutions was comparable to that of isolates con￾taining the single 595 substitution (Table III). Moreover, the
594 alanine substitution was subsequently detected in one of
the sensitive isolates (sen-I-1). The finding of adjacent muta￾tions which give rise to different susceptibility phenotypes
might indicate the specificity of the requirement for the catalytic
function and for the interaction with the substrate. This interac￾tion might involve direct binding or constraints imposed on the
tertiary structure of the binding site.
In one patient an alanine to valine substitution at position
591 was found in the plasma. Interestingly, the 591 alanine is
conserved in the UL97 homologue encoded by human herpesvi￾rus type 6 (6), and is one of four amino acids found deleted
in a HCMV resistant laboratory strain (5). Recently, Alain et
al. (21 ) have demonstrated by dot-blot hybridization that some
ganciclovir resistant HCMV isolates have mutations within the
same four amino acid sequence. Thus, a role for the alanine to
valine amino acid substitution is suggested in the development
of phenotypic ganciclovir resistance. Experiments are currently
underway to examine the impact of the 594- and 591-amino
acid substitutions directly by marker transfer. Two late-therapy
plasma specimens from different patients contained a substitu￾tion of valine or isoleucine for the methionine at position 460.
The 460-methionine, also conserved in human herpesvirus type￾Mutations in HCMV UL97 Gene Confer Clinical Resistance to Ganciclovir 261

6 is located in a region which by sequence homology has been
implicated in ATP binding (6). The direct role of the 460-
methionine substitution in conferring phenotypic ganciclovir
resistance has been recently demonstrated in a laboratory strain
(22). These findings support a conserved function for residues
in the proposed substrate recognition and nucleotide binding
sites in the clinical setting. Although the role of the UL97 gene
in HCMV replication has not been characterized, specific kinase
functions have been associated with homologous protein kinases
in herpes simplex virus type-1 and varicella-zoster virus (23-
25). The limited diversity we found in the predicted product
sequence among 13 clinical isolates and two laboratory strains,
in view of the greater sequence variability of other studied
HCMV genes (26, 27), suggests an essential role for UL97 in
the viral life cycle, which is dependent on conserved structure￾function relationship. However, the substitution of a conserved
residue within a conserved region did not affect the viability of
the virus. The mutated product may, therefore, retain its affinity
towards a yet unknown original substrate while selectively un￾able to phosphorylate ganciclovir. The clustering of ganciclovir
resistance mutations to the same UL97 sites in epidemiologi￾cally unrelated patients suggests that direct molecular analysis
of these sites will be useful for identification of drug resistance.
Sequence analysis of DNA from plasma of patients receiv￾ing treatment with ganciclovir revealed the same nucleotide
sequences found in the corresponding viral isolates grown in
tissue culture. However, while in vitro susceptibility assays re￾quired prolonged propagation of the virus, yielding mostly retro￾spective information, PCR sequencing of plasma allowed rapid
detection of mutations associated with resistance. Moreover,
detection in plasma has been previously shown to precede cul￾ture isolation and disease development (9). In fact, in one study
patient the emergence of a resistant strain was identified in
plasma 1 mo before HCMV could be grown from clinical speci￾mens. The persistence of wild-type sequences in plasma in two
clinically resistant patients was associated with a drug-sensitive
phenotype as determined by assaying of the corresponding viral
isolates. Thus, genotypic analysis of HCMV DNA in plasma
was able to distinguish viral drug resistance from host factors
involved in disease progression during therapy. However, de￾termining ganciclovir resistance by direct detection of specific
mutations in plasma should be performed with caution, because
other as yet unidentified mutations may contribute to the devel￾opment of resistance. Indeed, for one patient who excreted resis￾tant virus (patient 6), we could not identify a resistance-confer￾ring mutation in the UL97 gene. The lack of ganciclovir resis￾tance mutation in the UL97 catalytic domain in this patient
could indicate the presence of a DNA polymerase mutation.
Mutations in the DNA polymerase gene have already been de￾tected in laboratory derived ganciclovir-resistant HCMV strains
(28, 29).
The clinical course of patients infected with ganciclovir￾resistant strains indicates that resistant viruses retain their ability
to cause severe disease. However, little is known of the in vivo
replicative capacity of resistant strains, and their potential to
establish latency. These issues are of great relevance for the
management of HCMV disease. Sequence analysis of plasma
in two patients followed after discontinuation of ganciclovir
therapy revealed reversion of the mutation after 6 mo in one
patient, and persistence of the mutation 9 mo after cessation of
the drug in the other. These findings may reflect a variable
potential for resistant variants to persist in mixed virus popula￾tions in the absence of selective pressure, or a replicative advan￾tage of one strain over the other. Additionally, patients treated
with foscarnet may develop DNA polymerase mutations that
could result in resistance to both foscarnet and ganciclovir.
Further in vivo studies are needed to evaluate the effect of
alternative therapeutic regimens on the emergence and persis￾tence of resistant strains.
In summary, we have shown that point mutations in the
proposed ATP binding and substrate recognition subdomains of
the HCMV UL97 gene confer clinical resistance to ganciclovir.
These mutations can be detected directly in plasma. Direct geno￾typic analysis in plasma can permit early monitoring of patients
for the emergence and persistence of resistant HCMV strains,
and can provide the basis for guiding therapeutic decisions for
the treatment of HCMV disease.
