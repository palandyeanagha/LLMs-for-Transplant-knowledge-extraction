Abstract
Introduction: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and serious complication in intensive care unit (ICU) patients and also
often part of a multiple organ failure syndrome. The sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score is an excellent tool for
assessing the extent of organ dysfunction in critically ill patients. This study aimed to evaluate the outcome prediction
ability of SOFA and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) III score in ICU patients with AKI.
Methods: A total of 543 critically ill patients were admitted to the medical ICU of a tertiary-care hospital from July 2007 to
June 2008. Demographic, clinical and laboratory variables were prospectively recorded for post hoc analysis as predictors of
survival on the first day of ICU admission.
Results: One hundred and eighty-seven (34.4%) patients presented with AKI on the first day of ICU admission based on the
risk of renal failure, injury to kidney, failure of kidney function, loss of kidney function, and end-stage renal failure (RIFLE)
classification. Major causes of the ICU admissions involved respiratory failure (58%). Overall in-ICU mortality was 37.9% and
the hospital mortality was 44.7%. The predictive accuracy for ICU mortality of SOFA (areas under the receiver operating
characteristic curves: 0.81560.032) was as good as APACHE III in the AKI group. However, cumulative survival rates at 6-
month follow-up following hospital discharge differed significantly (p,0.001) for SOFA score #10 vs. $11 in these ICU
patients with AKI.
Conclusions: For patients coexisting with AKI admitted to ICU, this work recommends application of SOFA by physicians to
assess ICU mortality because of its practicality and low cost. A SOFA score of $ ‘‘11’’ on ICU day 1 should be considered an
indicator of negative short-term outcome.

Introduction
Although there are currently numerous co-existing clinical
scores for critically ill patients [sequential organ failure assessment
(SOFA) [1], Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) [2,3],
Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) [4–
6]], none of them has sufficient accuracy to predict outcome.
Raising the sensitivity and specificity and increasing the number of
parameters in order to enhance statistical power reduce the
simplicity and cost effectiveness for clinical use. Given the aging
population and numerous cases of co-morbidity in intensive care
unit (ICU) setting today, acute kidney injury (AKI) remains a
common and serious complication [7–9]. Pathophysiological
factors associated with AKI are also incriminated in the failure
of other organs, indicating that AKI is often part of a multiple
organ failure syndrome. The occurrence of individual organ
system failures varies among patients admitted to the ICU with
AKI, with different degrees of association existing between
individual organ system failures and ICU mortality. From this
viewpoint, the SOFA score is an excellent tool for assessing the
extent of organ dysfunction in critically ill patients with AKI
[10,11]. However, there is no extant literature comparing these
scoring systems in the setting of AKI defined by the risk of renal
failure, injury to kidney, failure of kidney function, loss of kidney
function, and end-stage renal failure (RIFLE) classification in
critically ill patients [12].
We hypothesized that the discriminative power of the SOFA
score in predicting ICU mortality is further enhanced for patients
with AKI compared to those without. Therefore, we undertook a
post hoc analysis of a prospectively accumulated database, to
explore 3 ICU mortality scoring systems (SOFA and APACHE II
& III) in critically ill patients with/without AKI and to compare

the scores in these heterogeneous groups in three ICU admission
settings.
Materials and Methods
Study participants and data collection
This investigation was carried out at three ICUs of one tertiary￾care referral center between July 2007 and June 2008. These ICUs
included two medical ICUs and one coronary care unit (CCU).
The Chang Gung Memorial Hospital Institutional Review Board
approved the study and waived the need of informed consent
because there was no breach of privacy and the study did not
interfere with clinical decisions related to patient care (approval
No. 101-3059B). The patient information was anonymized and
de-identified prior to analysis. There were 885 admissions during
this period; final diagnosis and admission duration were reviewed
first. Patients were excluded if they stayed in the ICU for less than
1 day (n = 89) or had repeated ICU admission (n = 56). Patients
under 18 years of age, with organ transplant and end-stage renal
disease (ESRD) with long-term dialysis were excluded (n = 154).
To determine the ICU outcomes, we also excluded patients
admitted to the ICU for observation after invasive procedures
(n = 43).
Finally, a total of 543 cases were enrolled in this study. Post hoc
analysis of a prospectively accumulated database examined the

demographics and clinical characteristics recorded on the first day
of ICU admission.
Definitions
Pertinent medical history included respiratory failure (need for
mechanical ventilation), AKI (based on the RIFLE classification),
severe upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding (defined as massive GI
bleeding combined with shock or need of ventilator assistance for
procedure), congestive heart failure (CHF, based on Framingham
criteria and defined as New York Heart Association functional
class IV), hepatic encephalopathy grade II (according to World
Congresses of Gastroenterology), shock (defined as hypotension
with systolic arterial blood pressure of 90 mm Hg despite adequate
fluid resuscitation), severe sepsis (defined as presence of 2 or more
systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria, proven or
suspected infection) and associated organ dysfunction (according
to modified American College of Chest Physicians and Society of
Critical Care Medicine consensus criteria), acute myocardial
infarction (AMI, defined according to the 2007 Expert Consensus
Document of Circulation from the European Heart Journal), acute
respiratory distress syndrome (based on the American-European
Consensus Conference), hepatic carcinoma rupture (diagnosed by
image and ascites puncture), arrhythmia (defined as ventricular
tachycardia, ventricular filtrations, 2- or 3-degree AV block) [12–
16]. The worst physiological and biochemical values on the first
day of ICU admission were recorded. Neurological scoring was
not performed in patients who were paralyzed or sedated since
their conditions were not classified as neurological failure. The
best verbal response for in-patients who had been intubated but
not sedated was determined according to clinical judgment. Illness
severity was assessed by the following scoring systems: APACHE
II, III and SOFA [1,4,5,17]. The RIFLE was also evaluated at the
time of ICU admission. Baseline serum creatinine (SCr) was the
first value measured during hospitalization. The modification of
diet in renal disease (MDRD) formula was used to estimate the
baseline SCr levels in 45 patients because these patients had been
admitted directly to the ICU and their previous SCr levels were
unknown [12].

Statistical analysis
Continuous variables were summarized by mean and standard
error unless otherwise stated. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was
used to determine the normal distribution for each variable.
Student’s t-test was used to compare the means of continuous
variables and normally distributed data; otherwise, the Mann￾Whitney U test was used. Categorical data were tested using the
Chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test. Furthermore, the Hosmer￾Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test was used for calibration when
evaluating the number of observed and predicted deaths in risk
groups for the entire range of death probabilities. Discrimination
was assessed using the area under a receiver operating character￾istic curve (AUROC), which was compared by a nonparametric
approach. The AUROC analysis calculated cutoff values,
sensitivity, specificity, and overall correctness. Finally, cutoff points
were calculated with acquiring the best Youden index. The index
is defined as sensitivity+specificity 21, where sensitivity and
specificity are calculated as proportions. Youden index has
minimum and maximum values of 21 and +1, respectively, with
a value of +1 representing the optimal value for an algorithm.
Cumulative survival curves as a function of time were generated
by the Kaplan-Meier approach and compared with a log rank test.
All statistical tests were two-tailed; a value of p,0.05 was
considered statistically significant.
Results
Subject characteristics
Five hundred and forty-three critically ill patients admitted to
medical ICUs were enrolled. Table 1 shows demographic data,
clinical characteristics and illness severity of patients with AKI and
non-AKI. The median patient age was 62 years. Three hundred and
ninety (71.8%) patients were males and 153 (28.2%) were females.
Among these patients, one hundred and eighty-seven (34.4%)
patients had AKI at ICU admission as determined by the RIFLE
classification. Compared to non-AKI patients, the AKI group had a
longer ICU stay, low hemoglobin (Hb) (p,0.001), less serum
albumin (p,0.001), as well as more hospital and ICU mortality.
Table 2 shows the demographic data and scoring systems of
ICU survivors and non-survivors. In the non-survival group of the
total population, these patients had longer ICU stays but fewer
hospital days. In addition, low Hb (p,0.001) and serum albumin

(p,0.001) were also noted in these patients. Moreover, the non￾AKI ICU non-survival patients still had a significantly longer ICU
stay but fewer hospital days. They also had very significantly lower
Hb (p,0.001) and serum albumin (p,0.001) on ICU day 1. After
adjusting the SOFA score in the multivariate analysis, the Hb and
serum albumin still reached a significant difference (p,0.05) for
those non-AKI patients. Furthermore, the AKI ICU non-survival
patients had significantly fewer hospital days but not significantly
shorter ICU stay. They also tended to have low Hb (p = 0.022) and
serum albumin (p = 0.014) on the first day of ICU admission.
However, the Hb and serum albumin were not found to be
significantly different for these AKI patients after adjusting the
SOFA score in the multiple logistic regression.
The reasons for admission to the ICU are listed in Table 3. The
major causes of ICU admission were respiratory failure (58%) and
severe UGI bleeding (21.7%). The causes of AKI are listed in
Table 4. The major causes of AKI are sepsis (34.2%), acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (17.1%) and hypovolemic
shock (12.8%).
Hospital mortality, short-term prognosis and results of
the scoring systems
Overall ICU mortality was 37.9% and the hospital mortality
was 44.7%. As for the assessment of calibration, Table 5 lists
goodness-of-fit, as measured by the Hosmer-Lemeshow analysis of
predicted ICU mortality risk and the predictive accuracy of the
APACHE III and SOFA scores in the different groups. In
predicting the ICU mortality, the accuracy of SOFA was as good
as that of APACHE III in the AKI group (AUROC:
0.81560.032). In the non-AKI group, APACHE III was superior
to SOFA (AUROC: 0.79160.027 vs. 0.75660.028). To assess the
values of selected cutoff points for predicting ICU mortality, the
sensitivity, specificity and overall correctness of prediction were
determined (Table 6). The APACHE III scores revealed the best
Youden index and highest overall correctness of prediction in both
groups. In the AKI group, ICU mortality rates differed
significantly (p,0.001) below and above cutoffs for 93 APACHE
III points and 10 SOFA points. Cumulative survival rates at 6-
month follow-up following hospital discharge differed significantly
(p,0.001) for non-AKI vs. AKI groups (Fig. 1). Figure 2 shows
the cumulative rates of survival for patients with coexisting AKI
admitted to ICU were dichotomized at 10 SOFA points or less,
and more than 11 SOFA points (p,0.001). To evaluate the
correlation among APACHE II, APACHE III, SOFA score and
various severity of AKI, we compared the means between groups
according to the RIFLE classification by using ANOVA. The chi￾square for trends revealed that the APACHE II, APACHE III,

Discussion
This post hoc analysis of a prospectively accumulated database
study included 543 heterogeneous patients with critical illnesses.
The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 44.7%, which is
consistent with figures obtained by previous studies indicating
poor prognosis of ICU patients with septic shock, ARDS, AKI or
hepatic cirrhosis. The occurrence of AKI in this work was 34.4%
(187/543) and is in agreement with previous report indicating that
the incidence was 35.8% of AKI (defined by the RIFLE
classification) in a mixed ICU. The overall AKI group ICU
mortality rate observed in this study was 62% (116/187), which
was high compared to other studies [7–10,18]. The high mortality
may have been attributed to the inclusion of two hundred and
fifty-two patients (46.4%) with underlying cirrhosis and ninety-one
patients (16.8%) with ARDS, both of which are positively
associated with mortality in AKI patients [19–23]. In this study,
we demonstrated that SOFA score at ICU day 1 has a comparable
predictive ability for ICU mortality to APACHE III in the AKI
group (AUROC 0.815 vs. 0.815). On the other hand, the
APACHE III was superior to the SOFA score in the non-AKI
group (AUROC 0.791 vs.0.756).
Renal failure is common in critically ill patients, and its
occurrence is associated with an extremely high mortality rate
[10,12,24,25]. Therefore, outcome prediction for short-term
prognosis is needed to identify patients with high mortality risk
from AKI. Since ICU patients with AKI is a syndrome and often is
precipitated by and co-existing with other organ failure, the SOFA
scores performance in evaluating the function of multi-organ
systems was found to be as good as those of APACHE III in this
work. Beyond the AKI, the mortality in an ICU setting is often
related to age and co-existing co-morbidity, thus making the
APACHE III score more accurate. When facing AKI patients,
assessing the function of other organs is important [10]. We can
simply use the six parameters to predict the outcomes and apply
this score to help clinicians to focus their attention on more severe
patients. Given that the SOFA score ignores diagnosis, age and co￾morbid conditions, this score probably reflects the unique
characteristics of the present patient group, whose prognosis can
be predicted without considering the factors of age and diagnosis.
The influence of age on outcome has been demonstrated to
decrease with an increase in disease severity [26,27]. This can, at
least partially, explain why age did not substantially influence the
probability of mortality. The mortality rates greatly increased
when SOFA scores of 11 or above were recorded in our study,
which means that integrating the RIFLE classification and SOFA
score, where $4 failed/dysfunction organs (including AKI), has
fairly poor prognosis. Furthermore, researchers have come a long
way in the study of the factors contributing to outcome in AKI
patients. At present, the measure of AKI severity can be done
using both ICU and specific AKI scores [11,28–31]. Among the
current general ICU scores, APACHE III and SOFA scores

promise to be very useful. However, because the number and
categorization of the variables considered in the APACHE III
score is greater, it gains in statistical power but loses in simplicity,
and thus the use of APACHE III entails extra cost [32].
In the non-AKI critically ill patients group, the discriminatory
power of the APACHE III for predicting ICU mortality is superior
to that of SOFA score. The non-AKI population in this study
admitted to ICU was composed of a high proportion of subjects
with AMI, CHF and cirrhosis. Anemia at baseline in patients with
AMI undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention is
common, and is strongly associated with adverse outcomes and
increased mortality [33–35]. In CHF patients, low Hb values
directly relate to poor peak oxygen consumption, disabling
symptoms, and impaired survival [36,37]. Das et al. retrospec￾tively evaluated the outcomes of 138 ICU cirrhotic patients and
identified the independent risk factors for in hospital mortality as
age, albuminemia, international normalized ratio and the SOFA
score computed after discarding points for hematologic failure
[38]. As responses to chronic disease, causes cachexia and
malnutrition (low Hb and albumin) as well as a systemic
inflammation. A lack of Hb and serum albumin prognostic factors
in the SOFA score may account for its discriminative inferiority to
APACHE III.
Despite the promising analytical results of this study, several
important limitations should be recognized. First, this study was
conducted at a single institution; consequently, the results may not
be directly extrapolated to other patient populations. Second,
scoring was performed only on the first day of ICU admission.
Sequential application of these scoring systems (for example, daily
or weekly) may reflect the dynamic aspects of clinical diseases and
thus provide more complete data for mortality risk. Third, the
patient population was heterogeneous and contained a high
proportion of AMI, CHF, ARDS and cirrhotic patients, and may
be viewed as a special subgroup of critically ill patients. Further
validation in other cohorts with a multicenter study may be
required in the future research. Finally, use of the prognostic
instruments in patients already admitted to ICUs rather than as a
preadmission screening tool may have skewed measurement
results.
Various novel biomarkers such as NGAL (Neutrophil gelati￾nase-associated lipocalin), KIM-1 (Kidney Injury Molecule-1),
interleukin-18 and cystatin C have been developed to assist early
diagnosis, differential diagnosis and prognostic prediction in
patients with AKI [39,40]. Combination of biomarkers and
traditional scoring systems may further improve the sensitivity,
specificity of clinical diagnosis and prognostic prediction, and
remained to be clarified in the future.
Conclusions
In conclusion, this investigation demonstrated that the prognosis
for AKI patients admitted to ICU is poor. The analytic data also
highlighted the good discriminative power of the SOFA score in
predicting ICU mortality of critically ill patients with AKI defined

by RIFLE classification. Considering the economy and ease of
implementation, we suggest that SOFA score can increase the
accuracy of short-term prognosis in this heterogeneous group of
patients.
