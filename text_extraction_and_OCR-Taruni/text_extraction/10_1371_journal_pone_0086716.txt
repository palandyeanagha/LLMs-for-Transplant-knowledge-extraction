Abstract
Background: Histology is a key element for the multidisciplinary diagnosis of fibrotic diffuse parenchymal lung diseases (f￾DPLD) when the clinical-radiological picture is nondiagnostic. Transbronchial lung cryobiopsy (TBLC) have been shown to
be useful for obtaining large and well-preserved biopsies of lung parenchyma, but experience with TBLC in f-DPLD is
limited.
Objectives: To evaluate safety, feasibility and diagnostic yield of TBLC in f-DPLD.
Method: Prospective study of 69 cases of TBLC using flexible cryoprobe in the clinical-radiological setting of f-DPLD with
nondiagnostic high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) features.
Results: Safety: pneumothorax occurred in 19 patients (28%). One patient (1.4%) died of acute exacerbation. Feasibility:
adequate cryobiopsies were obtained in 68 cases (99%). The median size of cryobiopsies was 43.11 mm2 (range, 11.94–
76.25). Diagnostic yield: among adequate TBLC the pathologists were confident (‘‘high confidence’’) that histopathologic
criteria sufficient to define a specific pattern in 52 patients (76%), including 36 of 47 with UIP (77%) and 9 nonspecific
interstitial pneumonia (6 fibrosing and 3 cellular), 2 desquamative interstitial pneumonia/respiratory bronchiolitis–interstitial
lung disease, 1 organizing pneumonia, 1 eosinophilic pneumonia, 1 diffuse alveolar damage, 1 hypersensitivity pneumonitis
and 1 follicular bronchiolitis. In 11 diagnoses of UIP the pathologists were less confident (‘‘low confidence’’). Agreement
between pathologists in the detection of UIP was very good with a Kappa coefficient of 0.83 (95% CI, 0.69–0.97). Using the
current consensus guidelines for clinical-radiologic-pathologic correlation 32% (20/63) of cases were classified as Idiopathic
Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF), 30% (19/63) as possible IPF, 25% (16/63) as other f-DPLDs and 13% (8/63) were unclassifiable.
Conclusions: TBLC in the diagnosis of f-DPLD appears safe and feasible. TBLC has a good diagnostic yield in the clinical￾radiological setting of f-DPLD without diagnostic HRCT features of usual interstitial pneumonia. Future studies should
consider TBLC as a potential alternative to SLBx in f-DPLD.

Introduction
Histology is a key element for the multidisciplinary diagnosis
(MDD) of fibrotic diffuse parenchymal lung diseases (f-DPLD)
when the clinical-radiological picture is nondiagnostic. Among f￾DPLDs, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is the most common
and lethal form [1]. IPF is defined by the presence of usual
interstitial pneumonia pattern (UIP) in the appropriate clinical
context. In a half of patients, UIP pattern is detected radiologically
(by high resolution computed tomography [HRCT]), in the
remaining half of cases the diagnosis rests on histology obtained by
surgical lung biopsy (SLBx) [2]. There are other conditions that
may result in chronic interstitial fibrosis, including nonspecific
interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), advanced sarcoidosis, chronic
hypersensitivity pneumonia (HP), and fibrotic pulmonary Langer￾hans cell histiocytosis [3]. It is important to correctly diagnose
these latter entities since they have a more favorable prognosis and

response to treatment. SLBx is the most reliable method to
histologically distinguish UIP from other forms of idiopathic
interstitial pneumonias and other processes that may mimic IPF
[1,2]. However SLBx has appreciable costs and risks (including
mortality: 2–6% within 90 days of the procedure) [4–7]. This
provides a strong rationale to find alternative diagnostic tools for
histopathologic diagnosis in this clinical-radiologic context of f￾DPLD.
Recent studies have focused attention on the potential role of
transbronchial biopsy (TBB) [8,9]. In a retrospective controlled
study [10] we reported a specificity and positive predictive value
for TBB with regular forceps in the diagnosis of UIP of 96% and
93%, respectively. However the sensitivity and negative predictive
value were low (30% and 50% respectively), in line with previous
reports [8,9]. The limited negative predictive value of TBB is
related to a high proportion of inadequate and nondiagnostic
fragments, mostly due to the small size of specimens, and
associated artifacts (especially ‘‘crush’’ artifact) [8,9,11,12]. To
overcome these obstacles we have previously tested the use of
larger forceps (Jumbo forceps) through the rigid bronchoscope
under general anesthesia [13]. We learned how to control bleeding
using the Fogarty catheter, and obtained more and larger
specimens compared to conventional TBB, but still not compa￾rable with the surgical samples. In recent years, a newer
bronchoscopic biopsy method, the cryobiopsy, has demonstrated
a superior diagnostic yield in comparison to conventional forceps
biopsy [14,15,16]. The advantage of the cryoprobe is that larger
pieces of tissue can be extracted with the freeze-thaw cycle.
Preliminary data showed that this technique is safe and the
occurrence of pneumothorax and bleeding are comparable to
regular forceps biopsies. We hypothesized that TBLC may have
an important role in the diagnostic evaluation of f-DPLD.
Currently there are no studies addressing the feasibility and
diagnostic yield of TBLC in this setting. Therefore, we designed
this study in order to test the potential role of TBLC in the
diagnosis of f-DPLD with nondiagnostic HRCT findings.
Materials and Methods
This prospective study was approved by the Area Vasta
Romagna Ethical Committee (Prot 2607/2010). Written informed
consent for participation in the study was obtained from each
patient before any study procedure. To prevent the risk of an
unnecessary lung biopsy was finally decided to suggest surgical
lung biopsy to the patients only when pathologists were not able to
identify any sufficiently informative pathological pattern on
TBLC. Seventy-three patients were enrolled into the study and
sixty-three underwent TBLC between April 2011 and September
2012 at the Pulmonology Unit of GB Morgagni Hospital, Forlı`,
Italy. These patients had clinical and radiologic features of
idiopathic f-DPLD, but insufficient elements to achieve a specific
diagnosis of IPF or other ILDs according to current international
consensus criteria [1,2].
Clinical assessment
We collected clinical data at the time of the first visit at our
Institution. We extracted the following data: age, gender, past
medical history, medications, smoking history, environmental
exposure history, physical examination findings, laboratory results,
and pulmonary function data. Patients had to be at least 18 years
old, with a forced vital capacity (FVC) higher than 50% of
predicted normal value, a diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide
(DLco) higher than 35% of predicted normal value, and a
pulmonary systolic arterial pressure estimated by echocardiogra￾phy less than 40 mm Hg. Exclusion criteria included coagulopathy
(platelet count ,70,0006109
/L, prothrombin time international
normalized ratio .1.5), FEV1 ,0.8 L, diffuse bullous disease,
hemodynamic instability and severe hypoxemia (PaO2 , 55 mm
Hg on room air).
Radiological assessment
HRCT images of 69 patients performed within 1 month prior to
bronchoscopy were reviewed by the radiologist (SP). 1 or 1.5-mm
collimation section were obtained at 10-mm intervals or volumet￾rically on multi-detector CT scanners with 0.6- or 1-mm
collimation and 1-mm reconstruction. All images were reviewed
at window settings optimized for lung parenchyma (width, 1500–
1600 HU; level, 2500 to 2600 HU). All patients included in this
study had a HRCT pattern of f-DPLD defined as ‘‘possible’’ UIP
or ‘‘inconsistent’’ with UIP according to current guidelines (2).
The radiologic pattern was also inconsistent with sarcoidosis,
Langerhans cell histiocytosis or other patterns of cystic or nodular
diseases.
The procedure
A flexible cryoprobe measuring 90 cm in length and 2.4 mm in
diameter was used (ERBE, Germany). The probe was cooled with
carbon dioxide (CO2) which allowed the temperature in the
probe’s tip to decrease to 275uC within several seconds. The
patients were deeply sedated with intravenous propofol and
remifentanil and intubated with a rigid tracheoscope. The biopsies
were obtained under fluoroscopic guidance using the flexible
bronchoscope inserted through the rigid tube into the selected
bronchus. Particular caution was given to the position of the
biopsy: the cryoprobe was placed perpendicular to the chest wall
to assure an accurate evaluation of the distance from the thoracic
wall by fluoroscopy. A distance of approximately 10 mm from the
thoracic wall was considered optimal. The biopsy site was decided
by the bronchoscopist taking into consideration the HRCT scan
appearance of each case. Once brought into position, the probe
was cooled for approximately 5–6 s, then it was retracted with the
frozen lung tissue being attached on the probe’s tip. The frozen
specimen was thawed in saline and then transferred to formalin for
fixation. To minimize the consequence of hemorrhage, we
performed each biopsy with a non-inflated Fogarty balloon placed
in the lobar bronchus near the biopsy segment. The Fogarty
balloon was always inflated after biopsy, then immediately deflated
in case of absence of hemorrhage. In case of bleeding the Fogarty
was deflated only after bleeding cessation, then we continued to
perform additional biopsies. Within 3 h after the procedure, a
chest X-ray was obtained to exclude pneumothorax. Oxygen was
administered continuously through the rigid bronchoscope and
spontaneous breathing was maintained during the procedure.
Oxygen saturation, blood pressure, and ECG were monitored
continuously.
Pathologic assessment
Hematoxylin-eosin–stained slides from TBLC were de-identi￾fied and sent to 2 pathologists (AC, TVC). The pathologists
examined the specimens independently and in a blinded fashion;
pathologic interpretations were made using the same features/
criteria as identified on surgical biopsies and pathologists assigned
a level of confidence (‘‘high’’ or ‘‘low’’) to their interpretations
relative to confidence for similar diagnoses on SLBx. Divergent
opinions were discussed and a consensus final diagnosis was
reached in all cases. For analysis of the TBLC data the following
parameters were recorded: the site where TBLC was performed,
the number and surface area of TBLC pieces, the presence of

pleural tissue and the presence of artifacts related to the procedure
(‘‘crush’’ artifacts and artifactual acute lung injury). At least one
fragment of alveolated lung parenchyma was required to classify
the biopsy as adequate. TBLC was considered nondiagnostic when
histopathologic criteria sufficient to define a characteristic
histopathologic pattern were lacking. Pathologic diagnosis of
UIP was made according to current guidelines criteria [2] (Fig.1).
All cases that exhibited pathological findings suggestive, or
definitive for, an alternative diagnosis were considered non-UIP
and classified according to the characteristic pathologic features,
i.e. nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) (Fig. 2), desquama￾tive interstitial pneumonia (DIP), respiratory bronchiolitis-intersti￾tial lung disease (RB-ILD), organizing pneumonia (OP), diffuse
alveolar damage (DAD), hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP),
follicular bronchiolitis (FB), and eosinophilic pneumonia (EP).
Statistical methods
Data were collected and analyzed after the final visit of the last
patient enrolled. To evaluate the feasibility and diagnostic yield of
TBLC in the diagnosis of f-DPLD we measured the yield of
adequate biopsies and the yield of diagnostic biopsies. We
evaluated TBLC in the detection of specific histopathologic
features of f-DPLD including the histopathologic features of UIP
and non-UIP patterns (i.e. NSIP, OP, DIP, RB-ILD, EP, DAD,
HP, FB). The interobserver agreement for the final diagnosis
between 2 pathologists was measured by K statistic and relative
95% confidence interval (95% CI). Safety analysis consisted in the
evaluation of the incidence of severe (requiring medical interven￾tion or hospitalization) and/or life threatening adverse events.
Statistical analyses were carried out using SAS Statistical.
Results
Safety
None of the patients needed intervention to control bleeding,
such as intubation with a double-lumen endotracheal tube or
surgery. Despite the preventive use of Fogarty we observed
prolonged bleeding in one case (1,4%). Pneumothorax occurred in
19 patients (28%) after the cryobiopsy procedure; and 14 (20% of
total) required chest tube drainage. Median time of hospitalization
after biopsy was 3 days (range, 0–9). In-hospital stay differs
significantly between cases with and without pneumothorax, 6
days (range 1–9) and 1 day (range 0–1), respectively. The risk of
pneumothorax was increased when fragments of pleura were
present in the biopsy, but did not correlate with number or size of
specimens (Table 1). One patient died (1.4% of the cases) seven
days after biopsy of acute exacerbation of IPF, the coexistence of
diffuse alveolar damage and UIP was confirmed at autopsy. The
patient was HIV-positive and the procedure was complicated by
massive pneumothorax which required the placement of drainage
tube and treatment with high flow oxygen, which may have
triggered the acute exacerbation.
Four patients were screened and enrolled in the study but did
not undergo TBLC. The reasons were desaturation during the
bronchoscopy in three cases and intercurrent atrial fibrillation
before bronchoscopy in one case. It should be noted that all three
patients that desaturated during rigid bronchoscopy were obese
(BMI.30 Kg/m2). In these four cases only BAL was performed.
Biopsy specimen characteristics
67 (95%) TBLC were obtained in the lower lobes in only one
segment. Median number of fragments was 3 (range, 1–6). Median
size of fragments obtained for single patient was 43.11 mm2
(range, 11.94–76.25). All but one case demonstrated at least one
fragment with alveolated lung parenchyma. Six biopsies were
nondiagnostic; mean number of fragments was 2.6 (range 1–5).
Between diagnostic and nondiagnostic biopsies there was not a
statistically significant difference in terms of mean number of
fragments, 3.1960.96 and 2.6761.37 respectively, p = 0.151.
Interestingly, the area of fragments strongly correlates with the
diagnostic yield, mean area was 41,99614.73 mm2 for diagnostic
cases and 28.43611.66 mm2 for non-diagnostic cases, p = 0.038.
Pleural tissue was detected in 23 biopsies (33%). Crush artifacts
were not seen and the alveoli were not compressed (Fig. 1 and 2).
Artifactual acute lung injury, probably related to tissue damage
from cold and consisting of edema, intra-alveolar fibrin and blood,
was detected in 40 (58%) cases. These artifacts were considered
minimal in 25 cases (36%) while appeared more extensive in 15
(22%) cases (Fig. 3).
Adequacy and diagnostic yield
Description of pathologic interpretations is reported in Fig. 4.
Adequate cryobiopsies were obtained in 68 (99%) cases. Among
adequate TBLC, the pathologists identified histopathologic criteria
sufficient to define a characteristic pattern in 63 patients (93%),
including 47 UIP (36 with high confidence and 11 with low
confidence, Fig. 1), 9 NSIP (6 fibrosing and 3 cellular, Fig 2), 2
desquamative interstitial pneumonia/respiratory bronchiolitis–
interstitial lung disease (DIP/RB-ILD), 1 organizing pneumonia
(OP), 1 eosinophilic pneumonia (EP), 1 diffuse alveolar damage
(DAD), 1 hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) and 1 follicular
bronchiolitis (FB).
Cases of UIP showing a combination of well defined patchy
fibrosis and fibroblastic foci, with or without honeycombing (Fig.1)
typically were assigned a ‘‘high’’ confidence for the diagnosis; ie.
all the features as seen in SLBx could be appreciated. Those cases
of ‘‘UIP with low confidence’’ tended to show the following:
patchy fibrosis + honeycombing (without fibroblastic foci),
fibroblastic foci + honeycombing (without patchy fibrosis), or just
one of the three main features of UIP (patchy fibrosis or

fibroblastic foci or honeycombing); in most of these cases with low
confidence of histologic diagnosis, the amount of tissue to evaluate
(in comparison to SLBx) was the main problem. A detailed
analysis of pathologic interpretations in UIP cases is reported in
Table 2.
Controls: surgical biopsy and autopsy findings
Six diagnoses were confirmed by surgery or autopsy. Five
diagnosis of UIP were confirmed by SLBx in three, autopsy in one
case and lobectomy in one case (for coexistent lung cancer). One
diagnosis of f-NSIP was confirmed by SLBx.
Interobserver agreement between pathologists in the
diagnosis of UIP
Interobserver agreement between the two pathologists for the
recognition of UIP on TBLC was very good, with a Kappa
coefficient of 0.83 (95% CI 0.69–0.97). Weighted Kappa
coefficient of agreement for the identification of UIP with high
or low confidence was good at 0,70 (95% CI 0,57–0,83). Analyzing
the pathologic features of UIP separately, it appears that the
agreement between the two pathologists is good with a Kappa
coefficient of 0.64 (95% CI 0.43–0.87) for the recognition of
honeycombing, 0.51 (95% CI 0.31–0.71) for fibroblast foci and
0.62 (95% CI 0.43–0.80) for patchy fibrosis.
The interobserver agreement between the two pathologists in
the recognition of non-UIP patterns on TBLC was not measurable
due to the limited number and different categories of other DPLDs
evaluated in the study. In 11 (16%) cases the blind pathologic
impressions were discordant and pathologists reached a final
consensus diagnosis after discussion of cases. A description of
discordant cases is reported in Table 3.
Patient characteristics and IPF diagnosis
Patient characteristics are reported in Table 4. Using the
criteria in current consensus guidelines (2), among 47 cases in
which pathologists detected some or all features of UIP, 20 were
classifiable as IPF and 19 as possible IPF, while the remaining 8
cases were unclassifiable (Fig. 5).
Discussion
TBLC in the diagnosis of f-DPLD appears safe and feasible.
TBLC has a good diagnostic yield in fibrosing interstitial
pneumonia in the clinical-radiological setting of f-DPLD when
high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) features diagnostic
of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) are not present. Pathologists
are generally confident in their ability to make diagnoses using
essentially the same criteria as for SLBx.
Safety is one important concern. Rigid bronchoscopy under
deep sedation was feasible in 94,5% of screened patients. Obesity
(BMI . 30 Kg/m2) was related to oxygen desaturation during
deep sedation, excluding the possibility to perform TBLC in 4% of
cases. Our pilot study, for safety concerns, was designed to
hospitalize and carefully observe all patients, thus probably over￾estimates the hospital length of stay. However even under this
unfavorable scenario our data shows that the time of hospitaliza￾tion is shorter than length of stay in our institution after SLBx, that
is 4.8 days (range,3–9). Reported median time of hospitalization
after SLBx procedure for any cause ranges between 4 to 8 days
[17–18], but elderly patients with ILDs are at higher risk of
prolonged hospitalization (more than 7 days) [19]. Given our
preliminary results future studies might reasonably propose TBLC
in an outpatient setting with hospitalization only of selected cases,
particularly when complications occur. Bleeding and pneumotho￾rax represent the most frequent complications of transbronchial
biopsy. The preventive use of Fogarty does not allow us to quantify
the true incidence of bleeding complications, but prolonged
bleeding occurred in one case (1,4%). Based on our experience we
recommend the preventive use of Fogarty catheter in all cases. We
screened patients by echocardiography to exclude cases with
pulmonary hypertension, this might have helped in preventing
severe bleeding. However, whether the routinely use of echocar￾diography before TBLC should be recommended is beyond the
objective of this study and remains to be addressed in future trials.
Previous studies of TBLC reported the occurrence of pneumo￾thorax in 5% of cases, comparable to regular forceps biopsies or
even lower in a subset of patients under surveillance for lung
transplant [14–16]. In our study pneumothorax occurred in one￾third of cases and the presence of pleura in the biopsy was
associated with increased risk. We did not find a correlation
between the incidence of pneumothorax and the number or size of
the biopsies. The higher incidence of pneumothorax may be
explained by the characteristics of our study population limited to
fibrosing DPLD. This hypothesis is in line with our previous results

showing that the percentage of pneumothorax by TBB in f-DPLD
was higher than for other DPLDs (8% of cases) [10]. The striking
incidence of pneumothorax is mainly related to the necessity of
biopsy the subpleural areas in this selected group of patients with
fibrotic ILDs. HRCT is essential to choose the site to biopsy in
these diseases, but the use of HRCT does not lower the incidence
of pneumothorax. The decision of taking peripheral subpleural
biopsies in this setting is forced by the exigency of obtaining
diagnostic samples that cannot be obtained with more central
biopsies. Acute exacerbation of IPF caused the death of one
patient 7 days after the procedure. This is the first report of a case
of death after cryobiopsy in DPLD. Death from acute exacerba￾tion after transbronchial biopsy can occur, but is infrequent, 0.3%
among 320 patients evaluated for IPF in our center (unpublished
data). Reported mortality for surgical lung biopsy is higher (2–6%)
[4–7], and in our Institution is 3,9% (unpublished data). These
preliminary results, show that the technique appears to be safer
than surgical lung biopsy, but not harmless. Among 113 cases
collected to date at our centre, one died (0,9%) and this lead us to
the conclusion that before this tool is widely adopted we need to
test its safety in larger multicentric trials.
The lung specimens collected in this study were large and well
preserved. Almost all specimens were adequate and the quantity of
tissue sampled was sufficient in the majority of cases to reach a
pathologic interpretation of cases. Pathologists were able to reach

a diagnosis even in cases with only one fragment. The number of
biopsies does not correlate with the diagnostic yield, but the size of
specimen does. We observed a higher diagnostic yield in cases with
larger total area of fragments. Crush artifacts were not observed
with cryobiopsy, whereas they are nearly always present in
specimens obtained by forceps biopsy [20–24]. In cryobiopsies,
acute lung injury changes (probably procedure-related) were
frequently present, but they were generally recognized as artifacts
and did not significantly interfere with pathologists’ interpreta￾tions. Comparing the data of this study to our previously published
results on regular forceps TBB in UIP, performed on a similar
population (f-DPLD with non diagnostic clinical/radiological
findings) and evaluated by the same 2 pathologists [10], it appears
that the proportion of diagnostic biopsies is dramatically increased,
from 30% for TBB to 93% for TBLC. TBLC significantly improve
the diagnostic yield of TBB for detection of UIP. Our results show
that TBLC in patients with f-DPLD can identify UIP with high
confidence level in 52% of cases and with low confidence level in
16% of cases. In our previous study we reported that TBB in UIP
cases detected all three features of UIP in only 0–2.5% of cases,
two features in 10–22.5% of cases and one feature in 5–20% [10].
Although this study was not specifically designed to evaluate the
impact of TBLC in the MDD of cases, TBLC yields a diagnosis of
definite IPF in one third of cases, and possible IPF in another third
of cases using the diagnostic criteria of current consensus
guidelines. The current IPF guidelines provide a framework for
assessing radiologic and pathologic features in suspected cases of
IPF. The terms ‘‘definite, probable, possible, and not UIP’’ are
used for the pathologic findings. While it is tempting to apply those
terms to cases in our series, we do not think it is appropriate since
those terms refer to features in SLBx. Our subjective assessment of
confidence of pathologic interpretation of TBLC should in no way
be equated with those terms.The agreement between pathologists
for the recognition of UIP pattern was very good and significantly
higher compared to what we previously reported for TBB (kappa
0.83 for TBLC compared to 0.61 for TBB). Previous studies
documented similar coefficient of agreement between pathologists
in the diagnosis of UIP also for SLBx [25,26,10]. However we
acknowledge that this study was not compared to surgical lung
biopsy and we cannot exclude the possibility that the impressive
agreement between pathologists reflects a bias related to the
smaller quantity of material and pathologic findings of cryobiopsy
in which we might miss important ancillary information. Against
this criticism the fact that in all 6 cases in which patients gave their
consent, we had a surgical confirmation of diagnosis. Compared to
regular forceps biopsy, cryobiopsy improves pathologists’ agree￾ment for the detection of patchy fibrosis (Kappa 0.62 for TBLC
compared to 0.29 for TBB), whereas no change in the agreement
on the recognition of honeycombing (Kappa 0.64 for both TBLC
and TBB) and fibroblast foci (Kappa 0.50 for TBLC compared to
0.51 for TBB) was observed. Nicholson et al. [25] reported levels
of agreement between pathologists for individual histological
criteria of UIP in SLBx to be higher than TBLC (mean K 0.75 for
fibroblast foci and 0.76 for honeycombing). Documenting the
presence of patchy fibrosis with regular forceps TBB is difficult for
the small size of samples and for the presence of crushing artefacts.
It is not surprising that with TBLC and SLBx this specific feature
of UIP is better recognized by pathologists compared to TBB.
A potential bias in this study is the fact that most cases had UIP
and the usefulness of TBLC in other forms of ILD may not be
generalizable. The three most challenging differential diagnoses
were NSIP, UIP and chronic HP, representing the majority of
discordant pathologic diagnosis in the blind analysis. Also for

Cryobiopsy in Interstitial Lung Diseases

SLBx, distinguish UIP from other diseases such as DIP, NSIP,
chronic HP can be rather challenging [25–27]. Nevertheless SLBx
performed in two lobes can detect cases in which different pattern
coexist and we recognize in the single lobe biopsies performed in
this study and in the lack of reliable controls (SLBx) two relevant
limitations.
We acknowledge that the absence of SLBx limited the possibility
to compare the accuracy of TBLC in terms of sensitivity and
specificity to SLBx for the diagnosis of f-DPLD. However, we
believe that a prospective randomized trial of cryobiopsy versus
SLBx is not ethical and practical in this era. Moreover, the blinded
pathologic review of the single lobe biopsy used for the purpose of
this study does not allow us to know how TBLC behaves when two
lobes may be biopsied and clinical-radiological and bronchoalve￾olar lavage (BAL) data are discussed with the pathologists [25,28].
For future studies, we propose to assess the role of cryobiopsy as a
potential replacement for SLBx in the MDD process. However,
given the lack of data on safety and feasibility of this technique in f￾DPLD, we think that these preliminary results provide cardinal
insights. Based on these results, larger and multi-center trials
evaluating the impact of TBLC on the final MDD of f-DPLD are
advisable for the future.
In summary, we conclude that TBLC in the diagnosis of
fibrosing interstitial pneumonia in the clinical-radiological setting
of f-DPLD with nondiagnostic high resolution computed tomog￾raphy (HRCT) features appears safe, feasible and has a good
diagnostic yield. Future studies should consider the use of TBLC
as a potential alternative to SLBx in f-DPLD.
