Abstract
BACKGROUND
Since the beginning of the pandemic, coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) in
children has shown milder cases and a better prognosis than adults. Although the
respiratory tract is the primary target for severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), cardiovascular involvement is emerging as one of
the most significant and life-threatening complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection in
adults.
AIM
To summarize the current knowledge about the potential cardiovascular
involvement in pediatric COVID-19 in order to give a perspective on how to take
care of them during the current pandemic emergency.
METHODS
Multiple searches in MEDLINE, PubMed were performed using the search terms
“COVID-19” or “SARS-CoV-2" were used in combination with “myocardial
injury” or "arrhythmia" or “cardiovascular involvement” or "heart disease" or
"congenital heart disease" or “pulmonary hypertension” or "long QT" or

language from January 1st, 2020 until July 31st, 2020. The websites of World
Health Organization, Centers for Disease control and Prevention, and the Johns
Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center were reviewed to provide up to date
numbers and infection control recommendations. Reference lists from the articles
were reviewed to identify additional pertinent articles. Retrieved manuscripts
concerning the subject were reviewed by the authors, and the data were extracted
using a standardized collection tool. Data were subsequently analyzed with
descriptive statistics. For Pediatric multisystemic inflammatory syndrome
temporally associated with COVID-19 (PMIS), multiple meta-analyses were
conducted to summarize the pooled mean proportion of different cardiovascular
variables in this population in pseudo-cohorts of observed patients.
RESULTS
A total of 193 articles were included. Most publications used in this review were
single case reports, small case series, and observational small-sized studies or
literature reviews. The meta-analysis of 16 studies with size > 10 patients and with
complete data about cardiovascular involvement in children with PMIS showed
that PMIS affects mostly previously healthy school-aged children and adolescents
presenting with Kawasaki disease-like features and multiple organ failure with a
focus on the heart, accounting for most cases of pediatric COVID-19 mortality.
They frequently presented cardiogenic shock (53%), ECG alterations (27%),
myocardial dysfunction (52%), and coronary artery dilation (15%). Most cases
required PICU admission (75%) and inotropic support (57%), with the rare need
for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (4%). Almost all of these children
wholly recovered in a few days, although rare deaths have been reported (2%).
Out of PMIS cases we identified 10 articles reporting sporadic cases of
myocarditis, pulmonary hypertension and cardiac arrythmias in previously
healthy children. We also found another 10 studies reporting patients with pre￾existing heart diseases. Most cases consisted in children with severe COVID-19
infection with full recovery after intensive care support, but cases of death were
also identified. The management of different cardiac conditions are provided
based on current guidelines and expert panel recommendations.
CONCLUSION
There is still scarce data about the role of cardiovascular involvement in COVID￾19 in children. Based on our review, children (previously healthy or with pre￾existing heart disease) with acute COVID-19 requiring hospital admission should
undergo a cardiac workup and close cardiovascular monitoring to identify and
treat timely life-threatening cardiac complications.

Core Tip: Cardiovascular involvement has emerged as a remarkable risk-factor for poor
outcomes of primary respiratory diseases such as coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID￾19). Nevertheless, the body of evidence of cardiac complications in pediatric COVID￾19 is still scarce to extract definitive conclusions about the adequate management for
these patients. This review establishes a perspective on how COVID-19 impacts on the
heart of both previously healthy children and those with pre-existing heart diseases,
and how to take care of them during the current pandemic emergency.

INTRODUCTION
The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) was first discovered in a cluster of patients
with severe respiratory symptoms in Hubei Province, China, in December 2019[1,2]
. By
early January 2020, analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid from infected
patients revealed that COVID-19 is caused by the novel coronavirus strain, named the
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)[3]
, a single-stranded
RNA virus belonging to the beta genus coronavirus in the coronaviridae family.
COVID-19 rapidly swept China and spread worldwide, becoming a global pandemic
causing significant mortality and morbidity[4]
. The current count of confirmed cases
and deaths from COVID-19 worldwide can be found at the website of the Johns
Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center. At the time of this review (July 31, 2020),
COVID-19 has caused more than 18 million cases and an estimate of more than 700000
associated deaths[5]
.
Since the beginning of the pandemic, COVID-19 in children has shown milder cases
and a better prognosis than adults[6]
. Children have worldwide so far accounted for
approximately 2%-5% of diagnosed COVID-19 cases[7-14]
. A review of 72314 patients by
the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention showed that only 1% of
COVID-19 cases were in children younger than 10 years old[15]
. Epidemiological
studies have consistently demonstrated across the world that children are at a lower
risk of developing severe symptoms or critical illness compared with adults. Dong
et al[16]
reported, in the most extensive pediatric study in China, that only 5.2% had
severe disease, while 0.6% had a critical illness, with a low case-fatality rate of less
than 0.1%. In North America, data from the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) as of March 2020 found that 2% to 3% of pediatric patients with
positive SARS-CoV-2 testing required hospitalization, with hospitalization rates for
children of 0.3/100000 in patients aged 0 to 4 years and 0.1/100000 in patients aged 5
to 17 years. At the time of this publication, there had been relatively few reported cases
of pediatric deaths attributed to COVID-19. In the United States the CDC reported a
total of 121/391814 (0.03%) deaths associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection among
persons aged < 21 years from February to July 2020. This supposed 121/190000
(0.06%) of all reported death associated with COVID-19 in the same period. The
median age of death in this age group was 16 years, with 30% of deaths occurring in
children younger than 10 years old[17-21]
. DeBiasi et al[22]
reported that 9/177 (5%) cases
of confirmed COVID-19 required pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission (no
mortality) in Washington, DC Metropolitan region. Chao et al[23] observed in New York
City that 13/67 (28%) of pediatric COVID-19 cases required PICU admission with a
mortality rate of 1.5%. Shekerdemian et al[24]
reported that only 48 pediatric cases
required PICU admission between March 14 and April 3, 2020, in 46 North American
PICUs, with a mortality rate of 4%. Götzinger et al[25]
in a multicenter (82 hospitals)
cohort study, including 582 individuals with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection
across 25 European countries, found that 363 (62%) individuals were admitted to
hospital and 48 (8%) individuals required PICU admission. Only four children died
(case-fatality rate 0.69%) suggesting that the case-fatality rate of COVID-19 in children
is substantially lower than in older adult patients. The mechanism by which children
seem less susceptible to severe infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 has yet to be
elucidated (Table 1)
[26-31]
.
Clinical manifestations of COVID-19 in children overlap with many other pediatric
viral infections. Most commonly, children presented with a mild flu-like state that can
progress to potentially lethal acute respiratory distress syndrome, fulminant
pneumonia, and multi-organ failure[10,32-35]
. Although the respiratory tract is the
primary target for SARS-CoV-2, the virus may interact with the cardiovascular system
producing myocardial injury through different mechanisms (Table 2)
[36-40]
, increasing
morbidity in both, previously healthy patients and those with underlying
cardiovascular conditions. Thus, cardiovascular involvement is emerging as one of the
most significant and life-threatening complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection in
adults[41,42]
.
Given the smaller numbers of pediatric cases of COVID-19 regarding adults, there is
still scarce data about the role of cardiovascular involvement in COVID-19 in children.
Of note, up to 34% of children with COVID admitted to the PICU in Spain presented
with signs of heart dysfunction[43]
. Besides, there is a suggestion that, as with other

Table 1 Hypothesized mechanism for the lower susceptibility of children to coronavirus disease-2019
Factor
involved Explanation
ACE2 receptor The ACE2 receptor is necessary for the entry of the COVID-19 into the cells. It is postulated that in children the development, function,
or activity of this protein could be lower. Also, ACE2 receptors are up-regulated in those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
or hypertension, which may partially explain more serious disease in those with comorbid conditions.
Reduced
exposures
Children may have fewer opportunities than adults to be exposed to the virus or to those with COVID-19. Children have fewer outdoor
activities and make fewer international trips, making infection less likely. Compared to adults, children have had less lifetime exposure
to toxins such as cigarette smoke and air pollution, factors which may affect the health of an individual’s epithelium.
Comorbidities Compared to adults, children have a low rate of comorbidities and most children with COVID-19 infection are young and previously
healthy.
Other viruses Children are susceptible to a wide variety of viral illnesses. The presence of other viruses may limit COVID-19 infection by competitive
mechanism. In addition, cross-reactive antibodies generated by exposure to other viruses may cause a partial protective response.
Inflammatory
response
Children have fewer pro-inflammatory cytokines secretion than adults. This may mean that adults experience a more pronounced
inflammatory response than children with a similar exposure to SARS-CoV-2.
Immune
response
Children have a more active innate immune response than adults. The innate immune system, which acts earlier than the adaptive
immune response, is more active in children, and may prevent more serious illness. Natural involution of the thymus over time leads
to a decline in circulating naïve T cells. Due to this normal process, immune systems in adults are less able to be adaptive than those of
children.

Table 2 Hypothesized pathophysiological mechanisms for cardiac injury in coronavirus disease-2019
Mechanism Explanation
COVID-19–related
myocarditis
SARS-CoV-2 may directly cause myocardial damage by entering cardiomyocytes using the ACE2 receptor, a human cell
receptor with a strong binding affinity to the virus spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (highly expressed in the heart). The virus is
also capable of active CD8+ T lymphocytes migrate to the cardiomyocytes and cause myocardial inflammation through cell￾mediated cytotoxicity. There is evidence demonstrating that SARS-CoV-2 infects the myocardial tissue.
Deregulated immune
response & cytokine
storm
SARS-CoV-2 infection may lead to deregulated immune response with higher neutrophil-lymphocyte-ratio, lower levels of
both T helper and T suppressor cells, and higher expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IFN-γ, TNF, IL-1, IL-6 and IL-18),
which are released into the circulation. This cytokine storm syndrome has a role in cardiovascular system injury, causing multi￾system inflammation and multi-organ failure with direct cardiotoxicity and rapid onset of severe cardiac dysfunction,
hemodynamically instability and vascular leakage with peripheral and pulmonary edema.
Oxygen supply and
demand imbalance
Myocardial injury may result from the imbalance between oxygen supply and demand due to a severe acute respiratory
distress syndrome and systemic hypotension with myocardial hypo-perfusion in association with increased cardio metabolic
demand in the myocardial tissue. This can result in myocytes hypoxia and necrosis.
Thromboembolic events The systemic inflammation secondary to the cytokine storm also causes endothelial dysfunction and increases the procoagulant
activity of the blood, which can further contribute to the formation of multi-organ micro thrombi and also occlusive thrombi
over a ruptured coronary plaque.
Cardiotoxicity of drugs
used against SARS-CoV￾2
Off-label drugs available for COVID-19 treatment can produce myocardial dysfunction, severe systemic hypotension, QT
prolongation with ventricular arrhythmia and AV block
Deleterious effects of
inotropes and
mechanical ventilation
Mechanical ventilation in critically ill children is another possible cause of cardiovascular adverse effects, such as a decrease in
cardiac output due to decreased venous return to the right heart, right ventricular dysfunction, and impaired left ventricular
elastics. Increased right ventricular after-load due to the pulmonary infection can be worsened by mechanical ventilation with
high PEEP, leading to right ventricular failure and subsequent myocardial injury. Inotropes can provoke an increased cardio
metabolic demand during an hypoxemic condition,
Pre-existing Heart
diseases
Patients with pre-existing heart diseases have increased morbidity and mortality related to viral infection It is reasonable to
assume that patients with underlying heart diseases with low cardiopulmonary reserve are susceptible to cardiac injury, and
once such patients are infected with COVID-19, myocardial ischemia or infarction, and left ventricular systolic dysfunction or
ventricular arrhythmia are more likely to occur, ultimately leading to a sudden deterioration.

viral illnesses such as respiratory syncytial virus or influenza, children with
underlying cardiac conditions are also at greater risk of cardiac complications or
develop a more severe SARS-CoV-2 infection[21]
. Furthermore, from April 2020,
increasing cases of previously healthy children showing a hyper-inflammatory state
and features similar to Kawasaki-Shock disease are being reported in Europe and

. Remarkably, initial reports suggest many of these patients have
myocardial dysfunction and coronary artery involvement with high requirements of
PICU admission, hemodynamic, and respiratory support. All the above brings out that
cardiovascular involvement could be a significant risk factor for severe COVID-19 in
children. Thus, all health care providers must be aware of the potential impact of
COVID-19 on children.
In this article, we aimed to summarize the current knowledge about the potential
cardiovascular involvement in pediatric COVID-19 to give a perspective on how to
take care of them during the current pandemic emergency.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
A literature search was conducted by all the authors using PubMed and MEDLINE.
Also, the websites of the health organizations including World Health Organization
and CDC and the website of the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center were
reviewed to provide up to date numbers and infection control recommendations.
Multiple searches were performed during the writing of this article, as the COVID-19
pandemic is still evolving. Search terms “COVID-19” or “SARS-CoV-2" were used in
combination with “myocardial injury” or "arrhythmia" or “cardiovascular
involvement” or "heart disease" or "congenital heart disease" or “pulmonary
hypertension” or "long QT" or “cardiomyopathies” or “channelopathies” or
"Multisystem inflammatory system" or "PMIS" or “MIS-C” or ”Pediatric multisystem
inflammatory syndrome" or "myocarditis" or "thromboembolism to identify
publications from January 1st, 2020 until July 31st, 2020. Reference lists of the articles
identified by this search strategy were reviewed to capture additional studies. No
randomized trials neither interventional studies were available at the time this article
was written; hence, observational studies, long-term prospective cohort studies, case￾control, cross-sectional studies, case series, or case reports were also included in this
review. Few additional articles before our search time period were included if they
were referenced in existing articles and included pertinent essential data for this
present article. Only articles published in the English language were included in this
review. After the initial search, the authors separately screened all abstracts based on
the eligibility criteria. Any abstracts or articles for which there was disagreement or
uncertainty were reviewed again and discussed until consensus was reached. We
finally included 193 articles. The included studies were categorized by whether the
study involved previously healthy patients or patients with pre-existing cardiac
conditions. As the vast majority of cases reported of pediatric cardiovascular
involvement are patients with pediatric multisystemic inflammatory syndrome
temporally (PMIS) associated with COVID-19, multiple meta-analyses were conducted
to summarize the pooled mean proportion of different cardiovascular variables in this
population. All the statistical analyses were performed using the STATA 14.0
(StataCorp. College Station, TX, United States).
RESULTS
Most publications used in this review were single case reports, small case series, and
observational small-sized studies or literature reviews. The most relevant articles were
16 studies with size > 10 patients and with complete data about cardiovascular
involvement in children with PMIS, 10 articles reporting sporadic cases of myocarditis,
pulmonary hypertension and cardiac arrythmias in previously healthy children, and
another 10 studies reporting patients with pre-existing heart diseases. Most cases
consisted in children with severe COVID-19 infection with full recovery after intensive
care support, but cases of death were also identified. The management of the different
cardiac conditions was extracted from the correspondent clinical guidelines or expert
panel recommendations.
Cardiovascular involvement in children with COVID-19 but without a pre-existing
heart disease
Pediatric multisystemic inflammatory syndrome temporally associated with
COVID-19: The incidence of severe COVID-19 in children is lower than in adults;
however, Pediatric multisystemic inflammatory syndrome temporally associated with
COVID-19 (PMIS) has been recognized worldwide over the past few months, changing

the paradigm that children are not severely affected by SARS-CoV-2. Since April 2020,
various alerts were issued in Italy, United Kingdom, and Spain about a local increase
in the number of these cases[44-46]
. After these reports, the first cases in North America
were reported in May 2020[47,48]
. Recently, cases of PMIS are currently also diagnosed in
Latinamerica[49]
. In May 2020, case definitions for PMIS have been produced by the
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.K.’s Royal College of
Paediatrics and Child Health, as well as by the World Health Organization
(Table 3)
[50-52]
. Following these case definitions, 570 cases of PMIS have been notified to
the CDC from March to July 2020[53]
. Taking into account that on July 29th there were
4.5 million cases of COVID-19 and that children account for 2%-5% of these cases, the
estimated incidence PMIS accounts for approximately 0.2%-0.6% of pediatric SARS￾CoV-2 infections. The case definition is nonspecific, and confirmatory laboratory
testing does not exist. Therefore, it might be challenging to distinguish PMIS from
other conditions with overlapping clinical manifestations such as severe acute COVID￾19 and Kawasaki disease (KD), making challenging to know the exact incidence of the
disease.
As the COVID-19 pandemic has evolved, case reports have appeared describing
school-aged children and adolescents presenting with persistent high fever and
systemic hyper-inflammation, reflected in a constellation of symptoms involving
multiple organ systems[54-89]
. They frequently manifested abdominal pain and
gastrointestinal symptoms, KD-like features, myocardial dysfunction, coronary artery
dilation, and cardiogenic shock. Most cases required PICU admission and inotropic
support, with the rare need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
Almost all of these children wholly recovered in a few days, although rare deaths have
been reported. These patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection either by
nasopharyngeal reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay or by
antibody testing. Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that higher regional
incidences of PMIS are associated with the larger COVID-19 outbreaks in the countries
mentioned above, with most PMIS diagnoses occurring approximately four weeks
after COVID-19 diagnoses peaks[80,83]
. This temporal and spatial association suggests a
causal link between SARS-CoV-2 and PMIS.
If PMIS is indeed related to infection with SARS-CoV-2, the pathophysiological
mechanism of disease is unclear. PMIS is presumed to reflect a post-infectious
cytokine-mediated hyper-inflammatory process, triggered by COVID-19 infection[89-95]
.
Of note, there are striking similarities between the overall clinical picture of children
affected by PMIS and the late phase of adult COVID-19 infection, characterized by
cytokine storm, hyper-inflammation, and multi-organ damage[96-98]
. Thus, they had
laboratory findings associated with the cytokine storm described in adults, including
high serum C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR),
procalcitonin, ferritin, Dimer-D, interleukin (IL)-6, Troponin and pro B-type natriuretic
peptide (proBNP) levels. These findings suggest similar pathogenesis and a spectrum
of illness from children to adults, leading to the hypothesis that PMIS is due to a post￾infectious inflammatory state that occurs several weeks after a primary infection with
SARS-CoV-2. Accordingly, most of the patients with PIMS were positive for IgG
antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 (which typically appears 2-4 wk after primary infection)
when the hyper-inflammatory symptoms appeared. Proposed mechanisms include
direct triggering of auto-inflammatory response and deregulation of immune
responses after COVID-19 infection, which could result in other environmental insults
triggering a hyper-inflammatory pathology in predisposed patients[89-98]
. One
hypothesis for the marked cytokine storm experienced by children with PMIS derives
from the ability of coronaviruses to block type I and type III interferon responses,
which can lead to an uncontrolled viral replication in those with initially high SARS￾CoV-2 viral load[99]
. Myocarditis has been demonstrated by late gadolinium
enhancement on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging in various children with
PMIS[77]
. Recently, the presence of viral particles of SARS-CoV-2 in different cell types
of cardiac tissue in the autopsy of a PMIS case has been demonstrated[72]
. This finding
points out that SARS-CoV-2 could also produce a direct myocyte injury similar to
other viral myocarditis as the mechanism of myocardial injury and heart failure
during the PMIS course. Both the virus-induced damage and the local inflammatory
response to cell injury could lead to necrosis of cardiomyocytes. The finding of viral
particles in neutrophils within the myocardium supports the idea of local virus￾induced inflammation. Of note, infection of endothelial cells in the endocardium could
result in the hematogenous spread of SARS-CoV-2 to other organs and tissues,
facilitating the typical multisystem failure.
Currently, available data so far suggests that PMIS shares a common
pathophysiological pathway and overlapping symptoms with that described in

3 of these criteria.
KD[100-106]
. However, clinical, laboratory, and epidemiological characteristics of PMIS
appear to be different from those of KD, raising the question if they are the same
entities. As the outcomes are distinct and PMIS seems to be more aggressive, it is
critical to make the subtle distinction between classical KD and PMIS. The absence of
cases in Asia, the predisposition of Afro-Caribbean people, the older age of the
patients, the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms in almost patients, the presence of
lymphopenia/Leucopenia, the abnormal coagulation indexes, the higher levels of
ferritin, D-dimer, inflammatory and cardiac markers, the higher rates of cardiogenic
shock, myocardial dysfunction, PICU admission, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)
resistance, the requirement of advanced respiratory or circulatory support and
mortality could be the main differences (Table 4)
[100-106]
.
For this review we selected only those studies that included at least 10 patients with
PMIS and with complete data about cardiovascular involvement (cardiogenic shock,
cardiac biomarkers, ECG, echocardiography), treatment (inotropes, mechanical
ventilation, ECMO support, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory) and
outcomes[45-48,54,56,60-62,65,66,68,70,76,78,86]
. We excluded those articles with suspected overlapping
of patients due to multiple communications of the same patients in different papers. In
our review, we found a total of 688 PMIS cases (56.8% male sex; mean age of 9 years)
reported by 16 different authors from April to July 2020 across Europe and North
America (Table 5, Figure 1). Of note, the vast majority of patients were previously
healthy (74.4%), and the most common associated comorbidities observed were
asthma and obesity, with a minimal prevalence of previous cardiac diseases. Since the
first cases were reported, it was noticed that PMIS could be a severe acute condition,

especially focusing on the cardiovascular system. Thus, the cardiac troponin and
natriuretic peptides [N-terminal (NT)-proBNP or proBNP] were increased in most
cases of PMIS (73.6% and 86.8% respectively). ECG alterations were not infrequent
(27.6%), overall in the form of unspecific ST segment and T wave alterations,
prolonged QT interval, and very few ventricular arrhythmia or AV blocks. However,
there have also been reported cases of sustained arrhythmias leading to hemodynamic
collapse and the need for ECMO support. Most important, as myocardial dysfunction
and heart failure have been observed in up to 52%-53% of cases, PMIS must be bear in
mind as a cause of new-onset heart failure in children during the pandemic. Also, and
similar to KD, PMIS can lead to the development of coronary artery alterations (15%).
Although infrequent, most of the cases of PMIS require hospitalization and intense
clinical management because of the severity of the disease. Two recent multicenter
studies in Spain reported that up to 31/252 (12%) of hospitalized children with
COVID-19 and that 27/50 (54%) of cases that required PICU admission were
diagnosed as PMIS[43,86]
.
In our review, we found that a PICU admission rate of 75.6%, with up to 56.4% of
cases presenting with shock requiring inotropic support, and 4.3% requiring ECMO
support. Conversely, only 22% of patients required mechanical ventilation, suggesting
that the primary pulmonary involvement could not be a significant issue in PMIS

cases. Despite prolonged PICU admissions (mean PICU stay 4-7 d), the reported
clinical outcomes for pediatric patients with PMIS appear favorable. Almost all
patients (93.7%) presented a rapid full recovery within the first week of the disease.
Most patients recovered when the severe inflammatory state associated with the
SARS-CoV-2 infection is resolved. For this purpose, a high proportion of patients
diagnosed as PMIS have been treated initially with IVIG (77.8%) and steroids (58%) in
a similar way to KD[100-106]
. However, to resolve this severe inflammatory state
associated is challenging, as these patients exhibit an increased resistance rate to these
anti-inflammatory therapies regarding those rates reported for KD. Hence, biologic
therapy blocking IL-1 (anakinra) and IL-6 (tocilizumab) receptors have been used in
up to 14.5% of PMIS cases. COVID-19 prothrombotic effects are concerning in
adults[107-110]
, increased use of anticoagulation (33.2%; mainly low weighted enoxaparin)
and antiplatelet agents (12.5%; primarily aspirin) have been observed in these patients.
Children with PMIS are at risk of thrombotic complications from multiple causes,
including hypercoagulable state, possible endothelial injury, stasis from
immobilization, ventricular dysfunction, and coronary artery aneurysms[111]
. Therefore,
antiplatelet and anticoagulation are recommended[112,113]
. The low-rate of aspirin use
could be explained by its prescription, especially in patients with KD-like clinical
presentations (20%-25%), or in those with evidence of coronary involvement (15%).
Cardiac sequelae in the form of mild myocardial dysfunction or coronary artery
alterations were present in up to 5.5% of cases. Furthermore, although the case-fatality
rate is known to be minimal in pediatric COVID-19, PMIS account for 15/121 (12%) of
SARS-CoV-2 associated deaths among persons aged < 21 years in the United States
from February 12th 2020 to July 31st 2020. Thus, we found a mortality rate of 1.8% in
this review, which is higher than the 0.1%-0.6% mortality rate for pediatric COVID-19
reported before the emergence of PMIS.
As the prognosis is excellent after treatment, the early diagnosis of PMIS and
prompt initiation of anti-inflammatory therapy is crucial for a successful, rapid, and
full recovery and preventing end-organ damage and mortality. For this purpose, a
high index of clinical suspicion is needed. As cardiovascular involvement is present in

Figure 1 Forest plot that summarizes the pooled mean proportion of the cardiovascular characteristics of children with pediatric
multisystem inflammatory syndrome associated with coronavirus disease-2019. Multiple separate meta-analyses were conducted. Considering the
high likelihood of between study variance, a random effects model was used. Continuity correction for total zero events studies was performed to include these in the
meta-analysis as recommended. Pooled data were presented with 95%CI and displayed using forest plots. Heterogeneity within studies was assessed using I

any form in almost patients with PMIS, the screening of cardiac alterations through
cardiac biomarkers, ECG, or echocardiography could be useful for the early
identification of PMIS cases. Data from this review indicate that PMIS cases have
similar manifestations and outcomes from different studies across the world.
Therefore, there are arguments to consider PMIS a new syndrome with a strong link
with SARS-CoV-2 infection. As fundamental aspects of PIMS remain unknown, future
studies will improve prospects for the prevention and treatment of this severe
pediatric condition. Until them, a close multidisciplinary collaboration among various
disciplines including pediatrics, intensive care, rheumatology, cardiology, and
immunology is warranted for the adequate management of these patients.
Cardiovascular involvement in previously healthy children out of PMIS: There is
also evidence of cardiac manifestation in previously healthy children out of the setting
of PMIS in children. Since the beginning of the pandemic, a few cases have been
reported with cardiovascular involvement similar to adults, in the form of
myocarditis, pericarditis, heart failure, cardiogenic shock, cardiac arrhythmia, and
pulmonary hypertension (PH) (Table 6)
[114-124]
. Although infrequent, these cases are
usually reported as severe or critically ill patients, pointing out the relevance of the
cardiac involvement also in previously healthy children with COVID-19.
Myocardial dysfunction and heart failure: Myocarditis is an inflammatory disease of
the myocardium, diagnosed by established histological, immunological, and immune￾histochemical criteria, caused mostly by infectious, immune-mediated or toxic
agents[125]
. Remarkably, SARS-CoV-2 may represent another viral etiology of
myocarditis. Acute myocardial injury by SARS-CoV-2 may be due to the coincidence

of various mechanisms including a direct viral myocardial injury, a secondary
inflammatory response in the form of cytokine storm, the severe hypoxemia due to
pneumonia, and the side-effects of therapy against SARS-CoV-2 infection (Table 1 and

To date, sporadic cases of myocarditis have been reported in pediatric COVID-19
patients as the first clinical presentation of the disease, alone or in the clinical context
of pneumonia. Dong et al[16]
found myocardial injury and heart failure occurring in up
to 0.6% (13/2135) of pediatric patients with COVID-19 reported to the Chinese Center
for Control and Prevention. In the following months, more sporadic cases have been
reported around the world[115-124,130,131]
. The myocardial injury affected all age ranges,
from neonates to adolescents, and a not low number of these children presented in an

unexpected form of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection with increased morbidity (PICU
admission, inotropic support, mechanical ventilation…) and mortality, including cases
of sudden cardiac death. Of note, the presence of viral particles of SARS-CoV-2 in the
myocardium of children with sudden cardiac death reinforces the direct viral damage
as one of the main mechanisms of myocardial injury in healthy children[72]
. Based on
the few published data, SARS-CoV-2 may represent a potential novel etiology of
fulminant myocarditis, which it should be suspected in COVID-19 patients with acute￾onset chest pain, ST-segment changes, cardiac arrhythmias and hemodynamic
unstability[131,132]
. Also, left ventricular dilatation, left ventricular hypo-contractility (on
echocardiography), and a significant increase in cardiac troponin and proBNP levels
could also be present. Myocarditis seems to be a rare event in pediatric COVID-19, but
when occurred, appears early in patients’ clinical history and could lead to sudden
cardiac death. However, as few studies described myocardial injuries in these COVID￾19 patients, the impact on clinical prognosis needs to be clarified in this population.
Pulmonary hypertension secondary to the primary pulmonary infection or PTE:
Right heart failure with increased pulmonary vascular resistance and PH should also
be considered as a possible cardiac manifestation in previously healthy children,
especially in the context of moderate-severe pneumonia with acute respiratory distress
syndrome and hypoxemia[132]
. PH is a well-known complication of pulmonary viral
infections leading to adverse outcomes when present, also in the COVID-19
scenario[114,133-136]
. Interestingly, nonetheless, concomitant pneumonia, PH has not been
reported as one of the main characteristic of the disease in children. Thus, we only
found one case of severe PH and right ventricular failure secondary to a severe
pulmonary infection in our literature review[114]
. In this case, the increased levels of
cardiac troponin and proBNP prompted an echocardiogram realization that diagnosed
severe PH. Previous cases reported of severe pulmonary hypertension in adults were
secondary to pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE), but no cases of massive PTE have
been demonstrated in children[137-139]
. Therefore, it has been hypothesized that the
pulmonary endothelial cell damage leading to the endothelium, the activation of
coagulation pathways, and deregulated inflammatory cell infiltration with cytokine
storm could be the primary physiopathological mechanism of the severe PH observed
in these patients[88-91,140]
. Small segmental pulmonary emboli (PE) have been observed in
some pediatric patients affected by PMIS supporting this theory[141-143]
, but the clinical
significance of these findings is still unclear. Finally, pulmonary artery
vasoconstriction due to severe hypoxemia and respiratory acidosis may act as a
coadjuvant factor for the development of PH[144,145]
.
Cardiac arrhythmia in healthy children: There are little data about the occurrence of
arrhythmias in the context of pediatric COVID-19. Data from 2 small-sized studies
showed that hospitalized pediatric COVID-19 cases could present a rate of cardiac
arrhythmia as high as 16%-20%[120,121]
. Initial data from Chinese observations suggest
that contrary to adult patients, whose myocardial involvement is sometimes correlated
with the appearance of life-threatening arrhythmias, children with COVID-19 share
less harmful rhythm troubles, such as supraventricular tachycardia, premature atrial
and ventricular complexes, first-degree atrioventricular blocks, and incomplete right
bundle branch block[16,36,121]
. Recently, Samuel et al[120] observed non-sustained
ventricular tachycardia in 5/6 patients that developed cardiac arrhythmia in a case
series of 36 children. Although all were self-resolving episodes, up to 50% of cases
required the initiation of antiarrhythmic drugs. Based on these few data, arrhythmias
represent a not rare clinical presentation of COVID-19, which could complicate the
clinical course of disease during hospitalization and worsen the prognosis of infected
patients. For this reason, careful electrocardiographic monitoring should be performed
in COVID19 patients to early detect paroxysmal arrhythmia that does not match the
disease status and might be a red flag of worsening disease.
Ventricular arrhythmias seem to be directly correlated to the COVID-19 induced
myocardial injury. Accordingly, a higher incidence of ventricular arrhythmia was
reported in adult patients with elevated troponin-T levels[37-42]
. Notably, 4 of 5 of the
cases of ventricular arrhythmia reported by Samuel et al[120]
, presented abnormal
echocardiograms with mild dilation/dysfunction of the left ventricle. Furthermore,
ventricular fibrillation has been documented in some cases of fulminant myocarditis
and sudden cardiac death in children[117-119,122]
. Therefore, the direct myocardial injury
seems to be a determinant factor for arrhythmia also in children. Hypoxemia and
electrolyte unbalance are not rare in the acute phase of severe COVID-19 and can also
trigger cardiac arrhythmias[146]
. The potential role of pharmacological treatments such
as hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin in enhancing the susceptibility to QT-

related life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, particularly Torsades de pointes
(TdP), is increasingly recognized in adults[147-149]
. Nevertheless, pediatric observations
have shown that these drugs are safe in previously healthy children[150]
.
The characteristic hyper-inflammatory systemic state of COVID-19 has been
proposed as a potentially crucial pro-arrhythmic factor. This fact is supported by the
occurrence of arrhythmic events in PMIS cases mentioned above. Strong evidence
from basic and clinical studies points to pro-inflammatory cytokines, mainly IL-6, as a
novel and essential risk factor for long QT-syndrome and TdP[151-153]
. Systemic
inflammation might additionally predispose to long QT-syndrome/Td as a result of
indirect mechanisms, such as the induction of cardiac sympathetic system hyper￾activation and the inhibition of cytochrome p450, particularly CYP3A4, leading to an
increased bioavailability of several medications, including QT-prolonging drugs.
The coexistence of myocardial injury and cardiac arrhythmias with COVID-19
makes it challenging the diagnosis and management of this entity. The early
recognition of cardiac symptoms and their timely treatment may be of pivotal
importance to improve the prognosis of pediatric patients, overall in those with severe
disease.
COVID-19 in children with pre-existing heart disease
Congenital heart diseases: Congenital heart diseases (CHD) affects approximately up
to 8/1000 (0.8%) newborns and remains the leading cause of infant mortality due to
congenital malformations[154]
. Currently, there are no reliable data with regards to the
burden of infected children with CHD and the COVID-19 related morbidity and
mortality in this setting. Few studies are focusing on children with CHD and COVID￾19, mainly limited to sporadic case reports or small case series (Table 7)
[155-162]
. These
children seem to be a vulnerable population to a potential clinical deterioration in the
presence of bilateral pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by
SARS-CoV-2, especially those with non-corrected complex cardiac defects and
decreased cardiopulmonary functional reserve. Furthermore, even patients with
corrected CHD can present with relevant residual lesions such as residual valvular or
shunt lesions, ventricular dysfunction, heart failure, arrhythmias, pulmonary vascular
disease, or cyanosis. Apart from the hemodynamic burden, some of these children
might have associated comorbidities such as lung disease, liver impairment, renal
failure, neurological sequelae, and impaired immunity associated with possible
concomitant syndromes (Down syndrome, DiGeorge syndrome, heterotaxy
syndromes with asplenia). Due to the documented myocardial involvement of SARS￾CoV-2 infection in both adults and children, and the increased mortality observed in
adult patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease and pediatric CHD with other
viral infections (Influenza and respiratory syncytial virus)[163-166]
, there is a possibility
that SARS-CoV-2 infection may produce new-onset of cardiac complications or a
worsening of the basal status in this vulnerable population. It is essential to bear in
mind that, as in other viral respiratory infections, it can be challenging to differentiate
pneumonia from cardiac complications in these children due to an overlapping
presentation. For example, children with non-cyanotic CHD with increased
pulmonary blood flow have higher than standard resting respiratory rates even in a
basal state, and some signs of respiratory distress can be secondary to heart failure.
Children with cyanotic CHD have low baseline saturation (< 92%) and cyanosis due to
their cardiac pathology. Due to these reasons, delayed diagnosis and treatment of
critical cardiac complications could also increase morbidity and mortality.
Children with underlying medical conditions represent 25% of the total pediatric
COVID-19 cases and 80% of those hospitalized. Hoang et al[167]
, in an early systematic
review including 7780 pediatric COVID-19 cases form 26 different countries, found
that a pre-existing cardiovascular condition was present in up to 14% of patients. In
the United States the CDC established on 6 April 2020 that chronic lung disease
(including asthma) is the most prevalent preexisting condition (50%), followed by
cardiovascular disease (31%; including obesity) and immunosuppression (12.5%).
Regarding the mortality rate associated with pre-existing conditions, the
CDC reported 121 deaths among persons younger than 21 years old in the United
States from February to July 2020. Of them, only 25% were previously healthy people.
The most frequently reported medical underlying conditions were chronic lung
disease (28% including asthma), obesity (27%), neurologic conditions (22%) and
cardiovascular conditions (18%). However, these reports did not analyze the
association with outcomes. To date, only one multicenter observational study that only
included 2 pediatric cases has focused on the clinical characteristics and outcomes in
patients with CHD infected by SARS-CoV-2. The authors found that of the 76 patients
included, cardiovascular complications were mainly found in the CHD-COVID-19

group, but they did not observe the worst outcome in this population[167]
. An early
systematic review by Sanna et al[36]
, including only the Chinese experience, concluded
that the presence of CHD is a high-risk factor for severe COVID 19 in children.
Götzinger et al[25]
, in a multicenter cohort study that involved 25 European countries
and included 582 children, found that 25% of pediatric COVID-19 cases presented pre￾existing medical conditions, which resulted in an independent risk factor for PICU
admission (OR, 5.06, 95%CI: 1.72–14.87; P = 0.0035) in multivariate analysis. Of note, a
total of 25 (4%) children had a previously known CHD as comorbidity, and they
present a higher risk for PICU admission (OR, 2.9, 95%CI: 1.0-8.4; P = 0.029) in the
univariate analysis. DeBiasi et al[22]
reported a cohort of 177 children with COVID-19 in
the United States. Of them, 3% presented a pre-existing cardiac condition, and these
patients were more common in hospitalized as a non-hospitalized group (9% vs 1%; P
= 0.004). However, when comparing the SARS-CoV-2 infected non-critically ill and
critically ill hospitalized patients, there were no significant differences in the presence
of underlying cardiac conditions (22% vs 6%; P = 0.180).
From these data, we can state that although plausible, there is not yet enough
evidence currently to support the association of CHD and severe COVID-19 in
children. It is necessary to bear in mind that these data could instead be a reflection of
the overprotective management that is usually given to these patients, with preventive
hospitalizations for monitoring even though they do not require treatment, nor do
they have severe clinical affectations. Hence, using recommended clinical criteria for
hospital admission in children with CHD might lead to many of these being
hospitalized, who could otherwise have been managed at home[12]
. Remarkably, the

Rodriguez-Gonzalez M et al. Cardiovascular involvement in pediatric COVID-19
WJCC https://www.wjgnet.com 5265 November 6, 2020 Volume 8 Issue 21
admission of these high-risk patients must be overweighted with the risk for SARS￾CoV-2 nosocomial infection, and the presence of CHD should not be used in isolation
for hospitalization. CHD constitutes a very heterogeneous group of patients and not
all the CHD have the same risk for adverse outcomes during viral infections.
Therefore, the identification of vulnerable CHD cases is crucial to improve the
efficiency of the management of this population, avoiding unnecessary
hospitalizations and also the late recognition of life-threatening complications in this
population. In the absence of strong pediatric evidence, risk stratification, and further
recommendations are currently performed based on the adult CHD anatomic and
physiological classification (Table 8)
[168]
. In summary, any child with a CHD requiring
medication for heart failure or arrhythmia may experience a worsening of their clinical
status because of the hemodynamic impact of the lung involvement and the
myocardial injury of SARS-CoV-2 infection. On the other hand, children with complete
and successful surgical correction of the CHD and without the need for cardiac
medications could be managed as healthy children. This approach requires individual
assessment and adjustment for consistency with current local recommendations. The
specialized evaluation by the pediatric cardiology team could be essential for the
adequate selection of cases that will benefit from hospitalization and more therapies
than supplemental oxygen, such as heart failure drugs.
In addition to the increased risk for severe infection, CHD patients are facing the
tremendous impact of the pandemic on outpatient visits and surgical programs
around the world[169-172]
. To minimize SARS-CoV-2 spread, extensive preventive
measures are essential for these patients. Similar to the general population, children
with CHD and their careers must adopt physical and social distancing measures,
meticulous hygiene with frequent hand washing, and use appropriately of facemasks.
Nevertheless, social distancing can be particularly challenging for pediatric CHD
patients, especially newborns and infants, who are a fragile population in need of
immediate and continuing care. Due to the declared lockout to restrict physical
contact, the many sick leaves for healthcare professionals, and the reallocation of CHD
specialists to general care facilities to deal with these sick leaves, the volume of CHD
outpatient visits may have to be reduced to essential visits only. Likewise, a profound
reorganization with prioritization of emergent and urgent procedures, and the
cessation of all-elective surgical activity has been adopted (Table 9). Therefore, there is
an expanding increase of the waiting lists, leading to a delay of the diagnosis and
adequate management of CHD complications and a delay of the optimal timings for
corrections of some stable CHD, with a potential direct effect on morbidity and
mortality. This problem is particularly significant in newborns and infants, who are a
fragile population in need of close and continuing care and often require surgery
during a narrow window of time to avoid death and provide for optimal outcomes. To
avoid preventable complications due to canceled visits and diagnostic or therapeutic
procedures, pediatric cardiology specialists should review outpatient appointments
and ensure that high-risk patients are prioritized. For most patients listed on class IA,
scheduled clinic visits should be converted to telehealth visits whenever possible, to
maintain social distancing to avoid disease spread[173,174]
. However, pediatric cardiology
teleservices could be not enough for complex chronic conditions. In these patients, the
risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure must be weighed against the needful in-person visits
case-by-case. It is still unclear the real impact of this reorganization in terms of
increased morbidity and mortality in this population. Of note, it would be essential to
catching up with all surgical interventions and outpatient visits deferred during the
pandemic at the same time that timely diagnosis and surgical corrections of all new
patients are being carried out.
Genetic heart diseases: Genetic heart diseases (GHD) represent a very heterogeneous
group of congenital disorders affecting the heart muscle (cardiomyopathies) or the
electrical system (channelopathies). Of them, the most prevalent conditions in children
are long QT syndrome (LQTS), catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia
(CPVT), Brugada syndrome, dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), and hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy (HCM)[175]
. These rare conditions are often the underlying cause of
life-threatening arrhythmias, myocardial dysfunction, heart failure, and sudden
cardiac death in children and adolescents. The role of SARS-CoV-2 infection in these
diseases is still not well known. The experience with COVID-19 in these patients is
even scarcer than the existent of CHD patients. To date, we only have found 1 case
report of a 5-mo-old infant with a personal history of DCM that presented a worsening
of his cardiac status during SARS-CoV-2 infection, leading to cardiac arrest and death
(Table 7)
[162]
. Also, a case of Brugada syndrome uncovered by fever has been reported
in the adult population[176]

1Patients with congenital heart diseases and complex anatomy are always at high-risk for poor outcomes independent of the physiological stage: Double￾outlet ventricle, truncus arteriosus, transposition of the great arteries, pulmonary atresia, mitral atresia, interrupted aortic arch, fontan procedure, single
ventricle, other abnormalities of atrioventricular and ventriculoarterial connection (crisscross heart, isomerism…), cyanotic heart defects (excluding fully
repaired defects).
As mentioned above, SARS-CoV-2 infection can produce myocardial dysfunction
and ventricular arrhythmia through direct myocardial damage and hyper￾inflammatory state. Also, as a viral infection, COVID-19 can provoke situations that
can act as triggers for myocardial dysfunction and ventricular arrhythmias such as
fever, hyper-adrenergic states, increased energetic and oxygen consumption,
dehydration, ion alterations (especially potassium, calcium, and magnesium),
metabolic crises with lactic acidosis… Finally, some drugs used against SARS-CoV-2
(hydroxychloroquine, Remdesivir, azithromycin, tocilizumab) could be
deleterious[177-180]
. Therefore, patients with genetic heart diseases may be at an increased
risk in the setting of COVID-19, necessitating additional precautions, and specialized
management. As a very heterogeneous group, disease-specific recommendations and
precautions should be employed. In the absence of enough evidence,
recommendations for the management of these rare diseases are based on previous
experience with other viral infections and following expert panel recommendations
(Table 10)
[181,182]
. For example, fever must be managed aggressively in Brugada
syndrome; potassium levels must be higher than expected in the case of LQTS.
Situations of dehydration can be dangerous in the context of hypertrophic

cardiomyopathy. In the case of DCM, there is an increased risk of metabolic
decompensation or lactic acidosis with associated severe myocardial dysfunction. The
increased adrenergic tone may be harmful in almost all cases, overall HCM, LQTS, and
CPVT. Finally, Covid-19 infection in patients with cardiomyopathies represents a
substantial risk of worsening patient clinical status, particularly in those who
experienced previous heart failure, arrhythmic events, or myocardial dysfunction on
echocardiography requiring medications.
Patients with GHD are suitable for multiple outpatient clinic visits, hospitalizations,
and surgical or electrophysiological interventions to have the reasonable control of the
disease. During the pandemic, similarly to those patients with CHD, only urgent

Table 10 Recommendations for the management of pediatric cases of genetic heart diseases during coronavirus disease-2019
pandemic
Disease Recommendations for management during COVID-19 pandemic
General
recommendations
Preventive measures to minimize SARS-CoV-2 infection: Social distancing, hand-washing, facial mask. Limit outpatient clinic visits
and electrophysiological and surgical procedures to life-threatening arrhythmias requiring immediate treatment, non-deferrable
treatments and urgent diagnostic devices. Rule-out the presence of ventricular arrhythmia or heart failure when common
overlapping COVID-19 symptoms appear: Dyspnea, syncope, cough, fatigue. Aggressive management of fever, diarrhoea and
adrenergic stress as the main triggers for cardiac complications. Balance fluid and electrolyte intake according to clinical status.
Influenza, pneumococcal and respiratory syncytial virus vaccination are recommended to reduce the possibility of co-infection of
COVID-19. Consider at home management as first option whenever possible. Consider initial hospitalization for closely monitoring
and intensive treatment in high-risk patients for heart failure or sudden cardiac death episodes. Pediatric cardiologist evaluation is
highly advised when hospitalization is required. Careful use of specific COVID-19 treatment (antivirals and immunomodulatory
drugs). Not discontinue usual cardiac basal.
LQTS Avoid hyper-adrenergic states as triggers of Ventricular Tachycardia and Torsade de Pointes. Fever is not a main issue in LQTS.
Aggressive control of fever is only recommended for LQTS type-2 cases. Beta-blocker therapy must be continued. QT prolonging
drugs should be avoided. Flecainide can interact with antivirals but must not be discontinued. Avoid and correct dehydration states
with ion alterations, overall potassium). Check serum electrolyte levels (especially potassium) in case of vomiting and diarrhoea.
Keep potassium level above 4mEq/l with potassium supplements. Consider hospitalization in high-risk patients: Previous syncope.
High-risk mutation. Infants younger than 1 year-old. Whenever an in-hospital admission is needed, a careful QT monitoring and a
telemetric system should be used. Specific therapies for COVID-19 that are known to prolong the QT interval, specially
hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and ritonavir, should be avoided or used with caution.
Brugada Aggressive management of Fever is the main issue. All patients should self-treat with paracetamol immediately if they develop signs
of fever and stay at home. Consider hospitalization in high-risk patients: Children without an ICD and with previous syncope,
spontaneous Brugada type-1 pattern on ECG, persistent fever despite paracetamol treatment at home, presence of palpitations or
syncope. Management in the hospital should include monitoring of ECG abnormalities and arrhythmia as well as efforts to reduce
the body temperature. If an ECG shows the type 1 Brugada ECG pattern, then the patient will need to be observed until fever and/or
the ECG pattern resolves. If all ECGs show no sign of the type 1 Brugada ECG pattern, then they can go home. Specific drugs for
COVID-19 do not influence on Brugada syndrome patients.
CPVT At present, there are no data suggesting that patients with CPVT are at increased risk of infection with COVID-19. Avoid hyper￾adrenergic states as triggers of Ventricular Tachycardia. Whenever possible, avoid the use of adrenaline in situations of ventricular
tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation (VT/VF). Adrenaline is contraindicated in the event of cardiac arrest. Beta-blocker therapy must
be continued. QT prolonging drugs should be avoided. Flecainide can interact with antivirals but must not be discontinued. An
increased heart rate alone (pacing-induced), as an important symptom of fever or stressful circumstances, does not appear to be
sufficient for the induction of ventricular arrhythmias. The antiviral or immunomodulatory therapy proposed for COVID-19 is not
expected to influence on CPVT patients.
Cardiomyopathies Avoid hyper-adrenergic and dehydration states that can provoke or increase left ventricular outflow obstruction leading to syncope
and sudden cardiac death in HCM. Avoid hyper-adrenergic states with increased energetic and oxygen consumption leading to a
worsening the myocardial function and decompensated heart failure in DCM. Consider hospitalization in high risk patients: Basal
left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, end stage cardiomyopathies, decompensated HF with no response to intensification of oral
treatment at home, syncope Hospital management include balance fluid and electrolyte intake according to the clinical status.
Predisposition to Pulmonary edema. Negative hydric balance in case of pulmonary edema in DCM. Positive hydric balance in case of
LVOTO in HCM. ECG monitoring watching for VA. QT monitoring, especially in patients on disopyramide and COVID-19
therapies). Echocardiography is mandatory to assess LVOTO and myocardial function.

surgical procedures and electrophysiological studies are performed, delaying all
elective procedures (Table 9) following expert panel recommendations[181,182]
. When
possible, most patients should at first be offered telehealth consultation, outpatient
clinic visits must be warranted for all the new patients with a history likely of a life￾threatening condition and the follow-up of patients with known genetic heart disease
when treatment cannot be optimized remotely. Patients with high-risk GHD and
SARS-CoV-2 infection could benefit from hospitalization for close monitoring and
management of cardiovascular complications. Again, expert evaluation of a pediatric
cardiologist may be essential in determining how best to minimize the risk of cardiac
events during hospitalization.
Issues with cardiac medication during SARS-CoV-2 infection: Many children with
underlying heart diseases are under treatment with cardiac medications during the
pandemic. Concern exists about the potential risks of deleterious effects of these drugs
when they are administered during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Anti-inflammatory drugs
(Aspirin, Ibuprofen, colchicine, steroids) are used in cases of pericarditis and
KD[102, 183, 184]
. They have been widely used in a safe and effective way in the treatment of
PMIS cases. Beta-blockers are commonly used in pediatric cardiology, mainly as a
treatment for heart failure in CHD or DCM, minimizing left ventricular outflow tract
obstruction in HCM patients, and preventing VT in LQTS and CPVT. Amiodarone,
sotalol, and flecainide do have interactions with other QT interval-prolonging drugs
such as ritonavir/Lopinavir and chloroquine but is an important enough therapy not

Rodriguez-Gonzalez M et al. Cardiovascular involvement in pediatric COVID-19
WJCC https://www.wjgnet.com 5269 November 6, 2020 Volume 8 Issue 21
to discontinue in these particularly stressful circumstances where paroxysms of
tachycardia could occur[185]
. Digoxin and diuretics should be used cautiously. Digoxin
action depends on potassium/calcium levels and toxicity may occur in case of
vomiting or diarrhea during COVID-19. Diuretics can provoke alterations on the
electrolyte imbalance and dehydration with deleterious effects for some patients[186]
. As
there is no evidence for the harmful effects of most of these drugs in the setting of
COVID-19, the general recommendation is to continue on these medications unless
contraindications or side effects appear.
Only the safety of Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors has been
questioned early after the beginning of the pandemic. RAAS is widely used in children
with CHD and heart failure as an agent to minimize afterload and avoid the abnormal
myocardial remodulation[185,186]
. It has been argued that RAAS inhibitors and
angiotensin receptor blockers may up-regulate of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2
(ACE2), hereby increasing susceptibility to the virus and hence may cause a more
severe infection[40-42,187]
. Anyway, treatment with RAAS inhibitors may down-regulate
the expression of ACE2, but it seems not to have a significant effect on its activity.
Thus, the data is currently insufficient to provide any definitive recommendation to
discontinue these medications in children taking them for indications for which the
agents are known to be beneficial. Therefore, the leading international cardiovascular
scientific societies recommend maintaining or initiating the ACEIs/ARB's treatment in
patients with heart diseases when indicated, irrespective of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Cardiovascular effects of drugs used for COVID-19 treatment: Once a patient with
underlying cardiac disease is diagnosed with COVID-19, the management of the
infection is similar to the general population, with a particular focus in the surveillance
of clinical signs of heart failure and ventricular arrhythmia. Currently, the primary
treatment for COVID-19 disease is supportive care, ensuring adequate oxygenation,
symptomatic relief with antipyretics, and nutritional support for the patient[12,188,189]
.
Most children can be managed conservatively and do not require specific treatment. In
the case of cardiovascular complications, the management should be done following
current guidelines and local protocols for each manifestation. In severe cases of
COVID-19, specific treatment with antiviral drugs (lopinavir/ritonavir,
chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine) to control viral replication at early stages or
immunomodulatory drugs (steroids or tocilizumab) to control the hyper-inflammatory
response at later stages of the disease may be considered[190]
. However, these drugs are
not considered the standard of care at this point. They are mostly off-label and
investigational drugs with only positive pre-clinical data. Of note, many specific
COVID-19 therapies have potential cardiovascular side effects, which can further
increase the risk of myocardial dysfunction and arrhythmias associated with SARS￾CoV-2 infection (Table 11).
Early in the pandemic, concerns have appeared about the potential of pro￾arrhythmic events due to the use of prolonging-qt drugs that have raised, particularly
the combined use of chloroquine (CQ), HCQ and azithromycin[147-149,191,192]
. The authors
of a small single-center, the retrospective study found no risk of QT prolongation or
TdP in children with COVID-19 under treatment with HCQ[150]
. However, the patients
included were not severely affected by the disease, and none of them required
intensive care, had cardiovascular comorbidity, and were taking corrected QT￾prolonging medications, nor had ionic alterations. Therefore, caution must be used
when applying them to patients with pre-existing heart disease. In the absence of clear
benefit and safety data, therapies associated with greater QT prolongation and
arrhythmic risk should be avoided, particularly if they are administered in
combination with CYP3A4-inhibiting drugs. If they are considered to be beneficial, a
step-by-step approach with the specialized supervision of the pediatric cardiology
team must be made to minimize the occurrence of cardiac toxicity (Table 12)
[193]
.
DISCUSSION
In this review, we have summarized the actual evidence about the cardiovascular
involvement in children with COVID-19. Although respiratory illness is the dominant
clinical manifestation of COVID-19, cardiovascular issues are emerging as one of the
most significant complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pediatric patients. As
described above, patients with pre-existing cardiovascular diseases and
with PMIS accounted respectively for 18% and 12% of pediatric deaths associated with
COVID-19. Remarkably, PMIS has approximately a ten-fold mortality rate regarding

used during coronavirus disease-2019 pandemic
Step-by-step approach to administer prolonging-etc drugs during SARS-CoV-2 infection
1 QTc intervals should be monitored at baseline and at 4 h after the administration of any QTc-prolonging drug.
2 QTc interval monitoring previously to combine any drugs prolonging the QTc interval or CYP3A4-inhibiting drugs.
3 QTc interval monitoring in patients with Known LQTS, acquired QT prolongation, or conditions associated with acquired QT prolongation (e.g, use of
other QT-prolonging drugs, underlying heart disease, bradycardia, liver and renal disease electrolyte alterations…)
4 Serum potassium, calcium and magnesium should be evaluated at baseline and monitored and optimized daily.
5 Avoiding hypokalaemia is not enough. Patients with acquired LQTS or patients using a combination of QT-prolonging drugs should have a high
serum potassium level (5 mEq/L).
If QTc increases by > 60 milliseconds or absolute QTc > 500 milliseconds (or > 530-550 milliseconds if QRS > 120 milliseconds) is observed

the rest of pediatric COVID-19 cases. These data indicate that prognosis is worse when
the cardiovascular system is impaired during SARS-CoV-2 infection in children.
Those patients with underlying heart diseases seem to be a vulnerable population at
high risk if they contract COVID-19. Both, the new-onset acute cardiac complications
and worsening of the basal state in patients with a low basal cardiopulmonary reserve
or high-risk pro-arrhythmic profile, can occur in these children. Of note, not all
patients with pre-existing heart diseases have the same risk for complications, and
therefore, the hospital admission and anti-COVID drugs administration must be
overweighed with the risk of nosocomial infections and side effects through a case by
case approach. Furthermore, the delay of timely elective procedures and the radical
decrease of in-person visits for the adequate follow-up at outpatient clinics may
provoke those not-expected complications before the pandemic occur. To avoid
preventable complications due to canceled visits and diagnostic or therapeutic

Rodriguez-Gonzalez M et al. Cardiovascular involvement in pediatric COVID-19

procedures, pediatric cardiology specialists should review outpatient appointments
and ensure that high-risk patients are prioritized.
Remarkably, a not negligible number of previously healthy infected children have
experienced severe cardiovascular acute events in the form of the new PMIS,
arrhythmia, pulmonary hypertension, heart failure, and even fulminant myocarditis.
The commonest complication in this population was PMIS, which affects mostly
previously healthy school-aged children and adolescents presenting with Kawasaki
disease-like features and multiple organ failure with a focus on the heart. They
frequently presented cardiogenic shock (53%), ECG alterations (27%), myocardial
dysfunction (52%), and coronary artery dilation (15%). Most cases required PICU
admission (75%) and inotropic support (57%), with the rare need for extracorporeal
membrane oxygenation (4%). Almost all of these children wholly recovered in a few
days, although rare deaths have been reported (2%). These observations point out that,
although infrequent, no child is free of the occurrence of cardiovascular events during
the SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Failure to accurately identify and timely manage cardiovascular complications
could lead to increased morbidity and mortality of these patients. Therefore, we
recommend that those pediatric COVID-19 cases who are ill enough to require
hospitalization should undergo a workup to the screening of cardiovascular issues
(Figure 2). Also, close cardiovascular monitoring during hospitalization to avoid
misdiagnosing these life-threatening entities should be warranted. The pediatric
cardiology team should be involved in the management of any children with a pre￾existing cardiac condition and any previously healthy children with abnormalities on
the screening workup. In absence of enough evidence, the management of cardiac
complications once they are identified should be based on the current guidelines, local
protocols and the physician´s experience for each individual condition[194]
.
CONCLUSION
There is still scarce data about the role of cardiovascular involvement in COVID-19 in
children. Based on our review, the cardiovascular involvement seems to be a relevant
factor of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children. Patients with pre-existing heart diseases
constitute a high-risk population for development of a severe acute COVID-19 and for
decompensation of cardiac conditions. In previously healthy children, PMIS has
emerged as a novel and severe condition during the pandemic. Furthermore, COVID￾19 can also produce fulminant myocarditis, ventricular arrhythmias and pulmonary
hypertension in previously healthy children. Data suggest that prognosis is worse
when the cardiovascular system is impaired during pediatric SARS-CoV-2 infection,
and that the vast majority of cardiac complications present a full recovery with a
timely support. As the early identification and treatment of this entities is crucial, the
performance of a cardiac workup and close cardiovascular monitoring of children with
severe SARS-CoV-2 infection is highly recommended.

ARTICLE HIGHLIGHTS
Research background
Since the beginning of the pandemic, coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) in children
has shown milder cases and a better prognosis than adults. Cardiovascular
involvement is emerging as one of the most significant and life-threatening
complications of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
infection in adults.
Research motivation
To investigate if cardiovascular involvement could be a significant risk factor for
severe COVID-19 in children.
Research objectives
We aimed to summarize the current knowledge about the potential cardiovascular
involvement in pediatric COVID-19, in order to give a perspective on how to take care
of them during the current pandemic emergency.
Research methods
A literature search to identify publications from January 1st, 2020 until July 31st, 2020.
was conducted using PubMed and MEDLINE. Also, the websites of the health
organizations including World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention and the website of the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center
were reviewed to provide up to date numbers and infection control recommendations.
The included studies were categorized by whether the study involved previously
healthy patients or patients with pre-existing cardiac conditions. For pediatric
multisystemic inflammatory syndrome (PMIS) temporally associated with COVID-19,
multiple meta-analyses were conducted to summarize the pooled mean proportion of
different cardiovascular variables in this population in pseudo-cohorts of observed
patients. All the statistical analyses were performed using the STATA 14.0 (StataCorp.
College Station, TX, United States).
Research results
We included a total of 193 articles in this review. The most relevant articles were 16
studies with size > 10 patients and with complete data about cardiovascular
involvement in children with PMIS, 10 articles reporting sporadic cases of myocarditis,

pulmonary hypertension and cardiac arrythmias in previously healthy children, and
another 10 studies reporting patients with pre-existing heart diseases. The meta￾analysis of 16 studies with size > 10 patients and with complete data about
cardiovascular involvement in children with PMIS showed that PMIS affects mostly
previously healthy school-aged children and adolescents presenting with Kawasaki
disease-like features and multiple organ failure with a focus on the heart, accounting
for most cases of pediatric COVID-19 mortality. Out of PMIS cases we identified 10
articles reporting sporadic cases of myocarditis, pulmonary hypertension and cardiac
arrythmias in previously healthy children. We also found another 10 studies reporting
patients with pre-existing heart diseases. Most cases consisted in children with severe
COVID-19 infection with full recovery after intensive care support, but cases of death
were also identified. There is an increasing concern about the delay of the diagnosis
and adequate management of congenital heart diseases (CHD) complications and a
delay of the optimal timings for corrections of some stable CHD due to the pandemic,
with a potential direct effect on morbidity and mortality.
Research conclusions
There is still scarce data about the role of cardiovascular involvement in COVID-19 in
children. Based on our review, all children (previously healthy or with pre-existing
heart disease) with acute COVID-19 requiring hospital admission should undergo a
cardiac workup and close cardiovascular monitoring to identify and treat timely life￾threatening cardiac complications. The management of the different cardiac conditions
should be based on the correspondent clinical guidelines, expert panel
recommendations and physician´s experience.
Research perspectives
Although cardiovascular involvement seems to be a crucial risk factor associated with
severe pediatric SARS-CoV-2 infection, more evidence in the form of multicenter
collaborative studies is necessary to elucidate this association.
