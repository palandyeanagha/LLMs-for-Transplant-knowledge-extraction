Obesity-induced inflammation engenders insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus
(T2DM) but the inflammatory effectors linking obesity to insulin resistance are incompletely
understood. Here, we show that hepatic expression of Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase
Receptor Gamma (PTPR-γ) is stimulated by inflammation in obese/T2DM mice and posi￾tively correlates with indices of inflammation and insulin resistance in humans. NF-κB binds
to the promoter of Ptprg and is required for inflammation-induced PTPR-γ expression. PTPR-γ
loss-of-function lowers glycemia and insulinemia by enhancing insulin-stimulated suppres￾sion of endogenous glucose production. These phenotypes are rescued by re-expression of
Ptprg only in liver of mice lacking Ptprg globally. Hepatic PTPR-γ overexpression that mimics
levels found in obesity is sufficient to cause severe hepatic and systemic insulin resistance.
We propose hepatic PTPR-γ as a link between obesity-induced inflammation and insulin
resistance and as potential target for treatment of T2DM.

Obesity has reached epidemic proportions as 1.9 billion
people are currently obese or overweight1. One of the
most serious complications of obesity is T2DM2.
Inflammation has been suggested as a mechanistic link between
increased adiposity and T2DM3. For example, several circulating
inflammatory cues increased in obesity have been shown to
obstruct insulin action; these include leukotriene B44, galectin-35,
interleukin 1-beta6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α)
7.
These molecules trigger NF-κB activity which contribute to the
development of cellular insulin resistance3. Also, JNK, p38, and
inflammasome have been suggested to link inflammation to
insulin resistance8–10. While pharmacological approaches aimed
at targeting the aforementioned mechanisms have had encoura￾ging outcomes there is still an unmet need for new, broad, and
effective tools for translation into the clinic11–17. We reasoned
that unmasking the identity of inflammatory mediators linking
obesity to insulin resistance could provide new targets for
improved T2DM treatment. Here, we show that the expression of
hepatic Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase Receptor Gamma (PTPR-γ)
is induced by inflammatory signaling and is increased in the
context of obesity. While PTPR-γ deletion enhances hepatic
insulin sensitivity PTPR-γ overexpression in liver is sufficient to
cause hepatic insulin resistance. Thus, our data unveil PTPR-γ as
an important link between metabolic inflammation and insulin
resistance and a new putative target for anti-T2DM therapy.
Results
Hepatic PTPR-γ level correlates with inflammation. PTPR-γ is
upregulated during inflammation18. As its role in metabolism is
unknown, we first monitored PTPR-γ expression in metabolically
relevant tissues of mice either fed on a high-caloric-diet (HCD; an
established model of obesity/T2DM)19, 20 or treated with lipopo￾lysaccharides (LPS; an established model of inflammation/insulin
resistance)21. Ptprg mRNA level was increased nearly by a factor of
two in liver, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue (AT) of HCD-fed
and LPS-treated mice compared to their standard diet (STD)-fed
or saline-treated controls, respectively (Fig. 1a, b). In humans, we
found that hepatic PTPRG mRNA contents increase proportion￾ally to the severity of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD); a
condition associated with increased inflammation and insulin
resistance22, 23. Indeed, subjects affected by non-alcoholic steato￾hepatitis (NASH; the most severe form of NAFLD) display the
highest while subjects affected by NAFL an intermediate level of
increased PTPRG mRNA content compared to healthy individuals
(Fig. 1c). In the same cohort hepatic PTPRG expression correlated
with the expression of the NF-κB targets IkBA, IL6, BLIMP-1, and
CCL2824 (Fig. 1d, e and Supplementary Fig. 1a, b). We also
directly measured PTPRG expression in liver biopsies from
another human cohort and found a strong positive correlation
between PTPRG expression and the expression of NF-κB targets
IkBA, MnSOD, and IL624 (Supplementary Fig. 1c–e) and subjects’
homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR;
an index of insulin resistance), and circulating insulin and glucose
levels (Fig. 1f–h). These data demonstrate that in the context of
obesity and inflammation PTPR-γ is upregulated in metabolic
relevant tissues and suggest that it could play a causative role in
insulin resistance in humans.
PTPR-γ antagonizes hepatic insulin action. To directly assess
the metabolic relevance of PTPR-γ we conducted loss-of-function
studies. Mice lacking PTPR-γ (Ptprg−/− mice)25 and their wild￾type littermates (Ptprg+/+ mice) were either fed on a HCD or a
STD. Chronic feeding on a HCD caused obesity in Ptprg−/− and
Ptprg+/+ mice as their body weight, fat mass, and circulating level
of the adipocytes-secreted hormone leptin were all significantly
higher compared to their genetically-matched STD-fed controls;

of note, in both feeding conditions lack of PTPR-γ did not alter
these parameters (Supplementary Fig. 2a–c). Caloric intake,
energy expenditure, O2 consumption, and CO2 production of
Ptprg−/− mice were normal (Supplementary Fig. 2d–g). Also,
adipocyte morphology and size distribution and the number of
UCP1-expressing brown-like/beige adipocytes and mRNA con￾tents of several brown/beige fat markers were normal in AT of
both STD- and HCD-fed Ptprg−/− mice (Supplementary
Fig. 2h–j). Thus, PTPR-γ is not required for normal body weight
homeostasis.
On the other hand, PTPR-γ deficiency profoundly affected
glucose and insulin balance. Chronic feeding on a HCD caused
insulin resistance in control mice as glycemia and insulinemia
were higher in HCD- compared with STD-fed Ptprg+/+ mice;
noteworthy, in both feeding contexts circulating glucose and
insulin levels were significantly reduced in Ptprg−/− compared
with Ptprg+/+ mice (Fig. 2a, b). Importantly, the level of
circulating glucose in HCD-fed mice lacking PTPR-γ was
comparable to the one seen in STD-fed normal mice hence
indicating a strong protective role of PTPR-γ deficiency
against development of hyperglycemia (Fig. 2a). Ptprg−/−
mice displayed improved glucose tolerance (Supplementary
Fig. 3a, b) suggesting that lack of PTPR-γ enhances insulin
action. To directly measure insulin sensitivity, we performed
hyperinsulinemic/euglycemic clamp and biochemical studies.
In keeping with our previous results (Fig. 2a), basal circulating
glucose was reduced in Ptprg−/− mice (Supplementary Fig. 3c).
During the clamp, circulating insulin levels were experimentally
increased and kept similar between groups (Supplementary
Fig. 3d). Improved insulin sensitivity was revealed by a higher
glucose infusion rate (Fig. 2c) needed to clamp euglycemia
(Supplementary Fig. 3e) in Ptprg−/− mice. Although insulin￾induced glucose disposal was normal (Fig. 2d), during the
clamp the amount of exogenously administered radiolabeled
glucose analog 2[14 C]deoxyglucose was increased in AT and
skeletal muscle of Ptprg−/− mice (Fig. 2e). To test whether
increased glucose disposal in these tissues is associated with
changes in insulin action at these sites we performed glucose
tracing analysis also in basal condition. Despite the fact that
Ptprg−/− mice have reduced circulating insulin level (Fig. 2b), the

amounts of radiolabeled 2[14 C]deoxyglucose in AT and skeletal
muscle of Ptprg−/− mice was increased also in basal condition
(Fig. 2f). Next, to independently assess insulin sensitivity in
these tissues we measured the statuses of phosphorylated
insulin receptor (IR) and AKT (which have been widely used as
measures of insulin action)26. Insulin administration increased
phosphorylation status of IR and AKT in AT and soleus skeletal
muscle of control mice (Supplementary Fig. 3f, g). In keeping
with the basal glucose tracing results (Fig. 2f) and the fact that
whole-body insulin-induced glucose disposal was normal
(Fig. 2d), insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of IR and AKT in
AT and soleus skeletal muscle of Ptprg−/− mice was similar to
Ptprg+/+ mice (Supplementary Fig. 3f, g). These data suggest that
the enhanced glucose uptake in AT and skeletal muscle of mice
lacking PTPR-γ is independent to changes in insulin sensitivity at
these sites.
Remarkably, the ability of insulin to suppress endogenous
glucose production (EGP) was prominently augmented in
Ptprg−/− mice as during the clamp this parameter was ~98%
lower in mice lacking PTPR-γ compared with controls (Fig. 2g).
As the liver largely contributes to EGP27, we independently
assessed hepatic insulin sensitivity. Insulin administration
increased phosphorylation status of IR and AKT in liver of
control mice (Fig. 2h and Supplementary Fig. 3h). In accordance
with the clamp results (Fig. 2g), insulin-stimulated phosphoryla￾tion of IR and AKT was enhanced in liver of STD-fed Ptprg−/−
compared with Ptprg+/+ mice (Fig. 2h). Similarly, we found
increased hepatic insulin signaling in Ptprg−/− mice in the context

of HCD feeding (Supplementary Fig. 4a). Also, insulin-stimulated
phosphorylation of these proteins was increased in primary
hepatocytes obtained from Ptprg−/− compared to Ptprg+/+ mice
(Supplementary Fig. 4b) suggesting a cell-autonomous effect of
PTPR-γ in antagonizing insulin action in hepatocytes. To gain
more mechanistic insights into the function of PTPR-γ, we
measured the activity of phosphatases/kinases in lysates obtained
from liver samples of mice lacking PTPR-γ and their controls. By
using arrays with immobilized tyrosine peptide substrates we
were able to identify known (e.g., JAK2)28 and putative new
targets of PTPR-γ. Our new results shown in Fig. 2i and
Supplementary Table 1 combined with our previous data shown
in Fig. 2g, h and Supplementary Fig. 3a indicate that PTPR-γ
affects hepatic insulin signaling and glucose metabolism by
altering phosphorylation status of proteins whose metabolic role
is known (e.g., IR, P85A, AKT) and also of others whose function
on hepatic insulin signaling and glucose metabolism is inade￾quately understood (e.g., LAT, PGFRB, EPHB1, ANXA1, FGFR3,
JAK2, FES, VGFR2, LCK, and JAK1). Together, our data
demonstrate that lack of PTPR-γ greatly improves glucose
homeostasis at least in part by enhancing hepatic insulin
sensitivity in a body-weight-independent manner.
Hepatic PTPR-γ overexpression causes insulin resistance. To
determine the tissue underlying the glucoregulatory action of
PTPR-γ we re-expressed PTPR-γ in liver of Ptprg−/− mice. To this
end, we generated recombinant adenoviruses with high degree of
hepatotropism (serotype 5) expressing either PTPR-γ and GFP
concomitantly (Ad-Ptprg-IRES-GFP, henceforward referred to as
Ad-Ptprg) or only GFP (Ad-GFP). As expected, GFP mRNA was
detected in liver but not in AT and skeletal muscle of Ad-Ptprg￾and Ad-GFP-injected mice (Supplementary Fig. 5a). While
hepatic Ptprg mRNA was undetectable in Ad-GFP Ptprg−/− mice
it was expressed in Ad-Ptprg Ptprg−/− mice (Fig. 3a). In keeping
with our previous results, Ad-GFP Ptprg−/− mice had reduced
glycemia and insulinemia (and normal body weight); however,

these phenotypes were rescued by expression of PTPR-γ only in
the liver as Ad-Ptprg Ptprg−/− mice displayed normal glycemia
and insulinemia (and body weight) (Fig. 3b–d).
Next, we set out to determine whether the pathological
overexpression of PTPR-γ in the liver of LPS-treated or HCD￾fed rodents (Fig. 1a, b) and humans (Fig. 1c–g) contributes to their
insulin resistance. To this end, we delivered Ad-Ptprg or Ad-GFP
in wild-type mice and generated a model overexpressing hepatic
PTPR-γ at levels similar to the ones seen in insulin resistance.
Indeed, Ad-Ptprg mice displayed hepatic Ptprg mRNA content
increased by a factor of two compared to Ad-GFP controls
(Fig. 3e); this level of overexpression resembles to the one
observed in HCD-fed obese and T2DM mice (Fig. 1a). Ad-Ptprg
mice had a tendency to hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and
reduced responsiveness to the glucose-lowering action of injected
insulin (Fig. 3f–h) suggesting that pathophysiological overexpres￾sion of hepatic PTPR-γ is sufficient to cause insulin resistance. To
directly measure insulin sensitivity, we performed hyperinsuline￾mic/euglycemic clamp and biochemical studies. During the clamp,
circulating insulin levels were experimentally increased and kept
similar between groups (Fig. 3g). Remarkable impairment in
insulin sensitivity was revealed by a 4-fold reduction in glucose
infusion rate (Fig. 3i) needed to clamp euglycemia (Fig. 3f) in Ad￾Ptprg mice. Insulin-induced glucose disposal was decreased in Ad￾Ptprg mice (Fig. 3j). To determine the tissue(s) underlying this
defect we measured the amounts of exogenously administered
radiolabeled 2[14 C]deoxyglucose. While glucose uptake in
skeletal muscle was normal it was reduced in AT of Ad-Ptprg
mice (Supplementary Fig. 5b). The test whether decreased glucose
disposal in AT is dependent to changes insulin action in this tissue
we assessed insulin sensitivity biochemically. Insulin administra￾tion increased phosphorylation status of IR and AKT similarly in
AT of Ad-Ptprg and control mice (Supplementary Fig. 5c). These
data suggest that in mice overexpressing hepatic PTPR-γ the
diminished glucose uptake in AT is independent of changes in
insulin signaling at this site.
While PTPR-γ deficiency greatly enhanced the ability of insulin
to suppress EGP (Fig. 2g) hepatic PTPR-γ overexpression
significantly impaired insulin action on the liver (Fig. 3k). In
line with the clamp data, insulin-induced phosphorylation of IR
and AKT was reduced in liver of Ad-Ptprg mice (Supplementary
Fig. 5d). The impaired insulin sensitivity caused by hepatic
PTPR-γ overexpression was not due to changes in body weight as
this parameter was normal in Ad-Ptprg mice (Supplementary
Fig. 5e). Collectively, these data demonstrate that hepatic PTPR-γ
overexpression at a level similar to one observed in obesity is
sufficient to cause hepatic insulin resistance.
Ptprg expression is induced by NF-κB and suppressed by
SIRT1
Our results demonstrate that hepatic Ptprg expression is induced
in the context of obesity/T2DM and inflammation and that it
greatly contributes to the development of insulin resistance.
Therefore, understanding the regulatory mechanism of Ptprg
expression is of pathophysiological relevance. Obesity and T2DM
are characterized by low-grade inflammation7, 29. Indeed, the
circulating levels of pro-inflammatory cues TNF-α and IL-6,
as well as the mRNA levels of the NF-κB target IκBα in liver,
skeletal muscle, and AT were all increased in HCD-fed Ptprg−/−
and Ptprg+/+ mice compared to their genetically matched STD￾fed controls (Supplementary Fig. 6a, b). Of note, in both feeding
conditions lack of PTPR-γ did not alter these parameters (Sup￾plementary Fig. 6a, b). The levels of several inflammation markers
in plasma, liver, skeletal muscle, and AT were also similar
betweeen Ad-Ptprg and Ad-GFP mice (Supplementary Fig. 6c–e).
These data suggest that the insulin sensitizing or inhibiting action
of PTPR-γ deficiency or overexpression, respectively, is not due to
changes in pro-inflammatory inputs.
To directly determine whether increased PTPR-γ expression in
HCD-fed or LPS-treated mice is due to inflammation or sec￾ondary to the many systemic changes brought about by HCD
feeding or LPS treatment we performed in vitro experiments. In
two unrelated cell lines (i.e., hepatic HepG2 and muscle C2C12
cells) treatment with the inflammatory cues LPS, TNF-α, or
interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1α) stimulated expression of MnSOD
(Supplementary Fig. 6f) and also of Ptprg (Fig. 4a, b); thus,
inflammation promotes Ptprg expression directly. To identify the
mechanism(s) underlying inflammation-driven Ptprg expression
we focused on NF-κB because we observed a κB binding site in
the promoter of Ptprg (Supplementary Fig. 6g). Thus, by per￾forming chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays we
investigated whether NF-κB occupies the promoter region of
Ptprg and whether enhanced inflammatory signaling augments
this occupancy. Our data indicate that NF-κB occupies the pro￾moter region of Ptprg and that this occupancy is increased by LPS
treatment in vitro (Fig. 4c) and in vivo (Fig. 4d). Also NF-κB
occupancy of Ptprg promoter is increased by HCD feeding
in vivo. (Fig. 4e). To determine whether NF-κB is required for
inflammation-induced Ptprg expression we inhibited NF-κB
activity by expressing an established mutant super-repressor
allele of IκBα30. In hepatic HepG2 and muscle C2C12 cells,
expression of mutant IκBα (IκBα DN) abolished LPS-, TNF-α-,
or IL-1α-induced overexpression of MnSOD (Supplementary
Fig. 6f) and also of Ptprg (Fig. 4a, b). Thus, inflammation is
sufficient to induce expression of Ptprg and NF-κB is required for
this effect in vitro. To determine whether Ptprg promoter region
is sufficient for inflammation-induced gene expression, we cloned
this region containing the κB recognition site upstream of a
luciferase reporter cassette and generated a reporter vector
(Supplementary Fig. 6h). This promoter sequence was sufficient
for LPS- or TNF-α-induced gene expression as treatment with
these cues enhanced luciferase mRNA content in cells trans￾formed with the reporter vector (Fig. 4f). Also, we mutated this
vector as such the κB recognition site is changed from
5′-GGGATCTCTCC-3′ to 5′-TGTATCTCTCC-3′ (Supplemen￾tary Fig. 6h); this mutation is known to abolish NF-κB binding31.
Of note, LPS or TNF-α treatment was no longer able to enhance
luciferase mRNA content in cells transformed with the mutant
vector (Fig. 4g). Collectively these results demonstrate that Ptprg
expression is induced by inflammation via activation of NF-κB.
SIRT1 is a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)
-dependent protein deacetylase32 that has been reported to pro￾tect against development of metabolic imbalance and to mediate,
at least in part, the metabolic beneficial effects of resveratrol
administration33–38. Because SIRT1 inhibits NF-κB activity39, we
tested whether SIRT1 antagonizes the action of NF-κB on Ptprg
expression. First, we found that SIRT1 down-regulation is suffi￾cient to cause increased Ptprg expression in vitro and in vivo
(Fig. 4h, i and Supplementary Fig. 6i). Second, our results indicate
that treatment with the SIRT1 activator resveratrol dampens the
stimulatory action of LPS on the expression of IKβα and Ptprg
(Fig. 4j, k). Moreover, hypercaloric-fed mice treated with the
NAD+ precursor and SIRT1 activator nicotinamide riboside40
displayed reduced expression of hepatic IKβα, MnSOD, and Ptprg
compared to their untreated controls (Supplementary Fig. 6j).
These results suggest that Ptprg expression is induced by
inflammation via activation of NF-κB and indicate that this effect
might be antagonized by SIRT1 activation.
To further test whether PTPR-γ is required for inflammation￾induced insulin resistance we compared the effect of LPS treatment
on insulin sensitivity in mice lacking PTPR-γ and their intact

controls. LPS treatment led to similar increases in expression level
of hepatic IKβα and MnSOD and plasma content of TNF-α and
IL-6 between Ptprg−/− and Ptprg+/+ mice (Supplementary
Fig. 6k–n). As previously described41, LPS treatment caused insulin
resistance; however, Ptprg−/− mice were protected from LPS￾induced insulin resistance (Fig. 4i). Thus, our data indicate that
LPS-induced insulin resistance requires, at least in part, PTPR-γ.
Discussion
Here we show that PTPR-γ is a negative regulator of hepatic
insulin signaling in both physiological and obesity/inflammation
contexts. Importantly, our results suggest a model in which
PTPR-γ links hepatic inflammation with insulin resistance and
glucose imbalance associated with obesity. Because PTPR-γ loss￾or gain-of-function does not alter body weight we suggest that
PTPR-γ regulates insulin signaling directly. Our results indicate
that the liver is a major site for the glucoregulatory action of
PTPR-γ and provide a mechanistic explanation for previous
findings showing that genetically-mediated induction of hepatic
NF-κB activity in lean mice causes insulin resistance20, while
hepatic-specific inactivation of NF-κB prevents insulin resis￾tance41. As an NF-κB target whose overexpression in liver is
sufficient to cause insulin resistance in lean mice and whose
hepatic level correlates with indices of inflammation and insulin
resistance in humans, our data also indicate that hepatic PTPR-γ
is an important molecular component of inflammation-driven
insulin resistance in rodents and humans.
Several questions arise from the current study. For example, in
mice lacking PTPR-γ insulin action in AT and skeletal muscle is
normal (Supplementary Fig. 3f, g); yet, glucose uptake in these
tissues is elevated (Fig. 2e, f). These results suggest that PTPR-γ in
extra-hepatic tissues may also be metabolically relevant. This issue
could be tackled by future studies in mice lacking PTPR-γ in a
tissue-specific manner. Also, does PTPR-γ regulate hepatic glucose
metabolism by targeting IR and/or other substrates? Interestingly,
IR42 and JAK228 have been shown to be dephosphorylated by
PTPR-γ and our data are in line with these results (Fig. 2h and
Supplementary Figs. 3h and 4b). Also, we identified other putative
PTPR-γ targets (Fig. 2i and Supplementary Table 1). Experiments
aimed at testing their role in mediating the effects of PTPR-γ on
glucose metabolism in vivo are warranted. Furthermore, are the
beneficial effects of SIRT1 activators (e.g., resveratrol, nicotina￾mide riboside) mediated by suppression of hepatic PTPRγ? While
our in vitro and in vivo data shown in Fig. 4h–k and Supple￾mentary Fig. 6i, j would suggest that this may be the case future
experiments in resveratrol- or nicotinamide-riboside-treated dia￾betic mice with our without PTPRγ are needed.
Our data suggest that means aimed at decreasing hepatic
PTPR-γ expression/activity should improve T2DM. This goal
could be achieved by development of specific PTPR-γ inhibitors.
For example, the improved insulin action shown in mice lacking
Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) propelled efforts
aimed at generating PTP1B inhibitors43, 44. Because glucose/
insulin phenotypes displayed by mice lacking PTPR-γ are com￾parable, or even superior, to the ones of PTP1B null mice43 it is
possible that our results trigger interests for developing PTPR-γ
inhibitors. Also, based on the available PTPR-γ crystal structure
data another approach could be pursued. PTPR-γ is thought to
exist in two conformations: the active monomer and the inactive
homodimer brought about by PTPR-γ binding to its endogenous
ligand(s)42. Several members of the contactin family have been
suggested as endogenous PTPR-γ ligands45, 46. Hence, experi￾ments aimed at testing whether these ligands inhibit PTPR-γ42, 47
and improve T2DM are warranted.
In summary, our results indicate that the increased hepatic
PTPR-γ level observed in obesity is sufficient to cause insulin
resistance and hence unveil PTPR-γ as a new target for anti￾T2DM therapy.
Methods
Animal studies. The Ptprg null allele was generated, as previously described25. By
breeding Ptprg−/+ males with Ptprg−/+ females we obtained Ptprg null (Ptprg−/−)
males and females and their wild-type (Ptprg+/+) controls. Only male littermates
were randomly assigned to experimental groups and compared with each other.
Recombinant adenoviruses serotype 5 expressing either PTPR-γ and GFP con￾comitantly (Ad-Ptprg) or only GFP (Ad-GFP) were generated by VectorBiolabs
(USA). Ptprg−/− mice re-expressing PTPR-γ in liver and their controls were gen￾erated as follows: 10-week-old Ptprg−/− and Ptprg+/+ mice were injected with 109
PFU into tail vein in 200 µL of saline. Hepatic PTPR-γ overexpression was achieved
by injecting 109 PFU into tail vein of 10-week-old FVB mice in 200 µL of saline.
Mice were housed in groups of 3–5 with food, either a standard chow rodent diet
(RM3, SDS, Essex, UK, Kcal content: 3.61 Kcal/g) or a high-fat diet (HCD; D12331
from Research Diets, New Brunswick, NJ, USA. Kcal content: 5.56 Kcal/g), and
water available ad libitum in light- and temperature-controlled environments
unless otherwise specified. HCD-fed mice were fed on a standard chow diet up to
8 weeks of age and then switched and maintained on a HCD diet. LPS and saline￾treated mice were generated as follows: 8-week-old C57BL/6 J males were admi￾nistered with either saline or LPS (300 μg/kg/day, Lipopolysaccharides from
Escherichia coli 0127:B8, L3129, Sigma-Aldrich) for 28 days using osmotic pumps
(model 2004; Alzet) inserted subcutaneously into the back of animals. Care of mice
at University of Geneva was within the procedures approved by animal care and
experimentation authorities of the Canton of Geneva, Switzerland (animal protocol
numbers GE/22/15, GE/28/13, GE/120/15). The number of mice used in each
experiment is mentioned in the corresponding figure legends.
Human studies. For this retrospective analysis, we included RNA extracted from
liver biopsy samples taken for diagnostic purposes from 20 male and 13 female
patients who were 25–69 years old (average age was 44-year-old) with histologically
confirmed chronic hepatitis C who were seen at the Division of Gastroenterology
and Hepatology of the University Hospital of Geneva. In total, 18 of these samples
were obtained from a multicenter treatment trial48 and 15 were obtained from a
study evaluating molecular correlates of steatosis. Both studies were approved by
the institutional review board of the Hospital University of Geneva (HUG) (ethical
approval obtained by HUG: reference number #02-070) and a written informed
consent was obtained from all patients. Total RNA from liver samples was
extracted using the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen). The quality of the RNA
was assessed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyser (Agilent Technologies). For all
patients, histological (e.g., steatosis and activity scores) and biochemical data
(plasma glucose and serum insulin) were gathered. The homeostasis model
assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was calculated as fasting insulin
(mIU L−1)×fasting glucose (mmol L−1)/22.5.
Cell lines and primary cultures. HepG2 and C2C12 cells lines were cultured
accordingly to the repository specifications (ATCC) and treated as follows. Spe￾cifically, C2C12 and HepG2 were maintained in DMEM (4.5 g/L glucose, 110 mg/L
pyruvate, 4 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/mL Pen/Strep) supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (PanBiotech). Experiments were done in 6 well-plate with 50,000
cells plated and cells were treated for 1 day with 0.1 ng TNF alpha (Thermofisher),
1 µg LPS (Sigma) or 1 h with 0.1 ng IL-1 alpha (Thermofisher). Primary hepato￾cytes from age-matched Ptprg−/− and Ptprg+/+ mice were established and cultured
following an established protocol. Briefly, KREBS-EGTA buffer was perfused in the
portal vein and cavea vein incised to evacuate washing buffer for 10 min. Liver was
digested with KREBS containing liberase (Roche) for 10 supplementary minutes.
Liver was removed and hepatocytes carefully isolated by centrifugation and plated
on collagen treated 6 well-plate with a density of 1,000,000 cells/well. They were
maintained 16 h in Williams’ E Medium (2 g/L glucose, 25 mg/L pyruvate, 2 mM L￾glutamine, 100 U/mL Pen/Strep) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and
serum starvation was carried out for 3 h in Williams’ E Medium without FBS and
Pen/Strep. Primary hepatocytes were treated with insulin (Sigma) for 10 min and
proteins were quickly extracted with RIPA buffer. All cells were cultured in a
humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2. All in vitro experiments were repeated
three times.
Assessment of mRNA and protein content. Mice were sacrificed, tissues quickly
removed, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and subsequently stored at –80 °C. RNAs
were extracted using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). Complementary DNA was gen￾erated by Superscript II (Invitrogen) and used with SYBR Green PCR master mix
(Applied Biosystem, Foster City, CA, USA) for quantitative real time PCR
(q-RTPCR) analysis. mRNA contents were normalized to 18s mRNA levels. All
assays were performed using an Applied Biosystems QuantStudio® 5 Real-Time
PCR System. For each mRNA assessment, q-RTPCR analyses were repeated at least
three times. Proteins were extracted by homogenizing samples in lysis buffer (Tris
20 mM, EDTA 5 mM, NP40 1% (v/v), protease inhibitors (P2714-1BTL from
Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), then resolved by SDS–PAGE and finally transferred to
a nitrocellulose membrane by electroblotting. Insulin-induced phosphorylation of

proteins and basal proteins levels were assessed by using commercially available
antisera as previously described49, 50. Briefly, nitrocellulose membranes were
blocked with Odissey blocking buffer (Li-Cor Biosciences) 1 h at room temperature
and successively incubated 12 h at 4 degrees Celsius with the specific primary
antibodies diluited 1:1000 in PBS-T buffer. PBS-T buffer is PBS buffer (27.6 g
Sodium Phosphate, dibasic + 160 g Sodium Chloride in 20 L distilled H2O at pH
7.4) and 0.5% Tween-20. Detection was obtained by using near-infrared secondary
antibodies diluted 1:5000 in PBS-T (IRDye 800CW and IRDye600RD; Li-Cor
Biosciences) and a Clx Odissey infrared scanner (Li-Cor Biosciences). The list of
antibodies and the primer sequences used for q-RTPCR analyses are shown in
Supplementary Table 2.
Blood chemistry. Fed hormones/metabolites levels were determined by collecting
tail blood from mice that were without food for 3 h. Fasted hormones/metabolites
levels were assessed in mice provided only with water ad libitum and without food
for the indicated period. Time at day at which blood was collected was the same
between groups. Tail vein blood was assayed for glucose levels using a standard
glucometer (Nova Biomedical). Plasma was collected by centrifugation in EDTA￾coated tubes (Kent Scientific) and assayed for leptin (Crystal Chem. Inc., Downers
Grove, IL), insulin (Crystal Chem. Inc.), TNF-α (Biovision) and IL-6 (Biovision)
levels using the indicated commercially available kits.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. ChIP assays were performed as pre￾viously described51 with a few modifications. Cross-linking was obtained with 1%
paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. The reaction was quenched for
10 min at room temperature by adding 0.125 M glycine. After three washes with 1×
PBS, cells were lysed with lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mM EDTA pH 8, 50 mM Tris￾HCl pH 8) supplemented with protease and deacetylase (TSA) inhibitors. Lysates
were sonicated on ice using a Bioruptor sonicator (2 pulses of 10 min, 0.5 min
sonication). Size of fragments obtained (between 200 and 1200 bp) was confirmed
by electrophoresis. Soluble chromatin was collected after centrifugation at 14,000
rpm at 4 °C for 10 min. Soluble chromatin was precleared with 100 μg/mL of
salmon sperm DNA (Amersham Biosciences), 2.5 μg/mL of unspecific IgGs, and
protein-A-Sepharose at 50% overnight at 4 °C in rotation. After centrifugation
(3000 rpm, 3 min at 4 °C), supernatants were collected and specific antibody was
added. The antibody used was 5 μL anti-NF-κB p65 (Cell Signaling #8242). A
control was performed with unspecific IgGs (AbCam). Also, 1–5% of soluble pre￾cleared chromatin was kept at −20 °C as Inputs. Mixtures were incubated at 4 °C
for 6 h in rotation and then incubated overnight at 4 °C in rotation with protein-A￾Sepharose at 50% (Roche). Beads were collected and washed sequentially at 4 °C for
10 min with TSE I (150 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mM EDTA, and
20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.1)), TSE II (500 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2
mM EDTA, and 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.1)), and buffer III (0.25 LiCl, 1% Nonidet
P−40, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA, and 10 mM Tris–Hcl (pH 8.1)). Beads were
washed once with 1× PBS by pipetting and immunoprecipitates were eluted two
times (20-min incubation) with elution buffer (0.1 M NaHCO3 and 1% SDS).
Reversion of cross-linking was performed overnight by heating samples and input
controls at 65 °C, and DNA was purified using the QIAquick spin kit (Qiagen).
Real time PCR was performed, as described above. Data were normalized to values
obtained with unspecific IgGs (Abcam). The primer sequences used for ChIP
analysis are shown in Supplementary Table 2.
Assessment of energy homeostasis. Body fat and lean mass were determined
using the EchoMRI-700 system and caloric intake, energy expenditure, O2 con￾sumption, and CO2 production were measured using the TSE labmaster system
available in the core facility of the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Geneva
(http://www.unige.ch/medecine/en/recherche/corefacilities/).
Immunohistochemistry analyses. Hematoxylin and eosin staining and UCP1
immunohistochemistry were performed using paraffin-embedded adipose tissue
sections as previously described52. Briefly, 6 μm-thick sections were mounted on
glass slides and treated for paraffin removal by serial passages (each of them 5′) in
xylene and then PBS containig decreasing concentration of ethanol (100%, 70%,
50%, and 0%). All steps were performed at room temperature on an orbital shaker
at ~50 rpm. Sections stored in PBS were first washed in PBS three times for 10 min
each. Sections were then incubated in 0.3% H2O2 for 30 min to block the endo￾genous peroxidase activity and subsequently rinsed in PBS three times for 10 min
each. All sections were then placed in blocking solution of 3% bovine serum
albumin in PBT-Azide (2.5 mL of Triton X-100 in 1000 mL of PBS-Azide) for 2 h.
The sections were then transferred into 1:5000 primary antisera (see Supplemen￾tary Table 2) with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBT-Azide overnight. The sections
were then rinsed with PBS six times for 10 min each. Next, sections were trans￾ferred into 1:1000 biotin-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antisera (Jack￾son Immuno Research) with 3% normal donkey serum in PBT for 2 h and
subsequently rinsed in PBS three times for 10 min each. Avidin Biotin Complex
(Vectastain Elite PK-6100 ABC kit, Vector Laboratories) solution was prepared
(1:500 in PBS) 30 min prior to incubating the sections in it for 1 h and subsequently
rinsed in PBS two times for 10 min each. The sections were then incubated in
0.04% 3,3′-Diaminobenzidine and 0.01% H2O2 in PBS for 8 min. Finally, the
sections were washed in PBS two times for 10 min each and mounted on gelatin
coated glass slides for visualization. Adjacent sections were used for hematoxylin
and eosin (H&E) staining.
Assessment of glucose homeostasis. Hyperinsulinemic-euglyclemic clamps
were performed in age-matched conscious unrestrained catheterized mice as pre￾viously described53. Briefly, catheters were surgically implanted 7 days prior to the
experiment, in the right jugular vein and exteriorized above the neck using vascular
access button (Instech Laboratories Inc., Plymouth Meeting, PA). Mice were fasted
for 3 h, followed by a 2-h infusion of [3-3H] glucose (0.05 μCi/min) (Perkin Elmer,
Walthman, MA). Continuous insulin infusion (1.5 mIU/kg body weight/min,
Umuline®, Lilly France, Neuilly-sur-Seine, France) was used for the induction of
hyperinsulinemia. At reached steady state, in vivo insulin-stimulated glucose
uptake in tissues was determined by a 10 μCi bolus injection of 2-[14C] deox￾yglucose. After 30 min, mice were rapidly killed by cervical dislocation and tissues
removed and stored at −80 °C until use. Glucose concentration was measured using
the glucose oxidase method (GLU, Roche Diagnostics, Rotkreuz, Switzerland) and
insulin using an ELISA commercial kit (CrystalChem Inc., Downers Grove, IL).
Insulin tolerance test (ITT) was performed, as previously described53. Briefly,
glycemia was monitored in mice after an intraperitoneal bolus of insulin as indi￾cated in the legend of figures representing ITT experiments.
LPS treatment. Eight-week-old male mice were treated with saline or LPS (300 μg/
kg/day, Lipopolysaccharides from Escherichia coli 0127:B8, ref. L3129, Sigma￾Aldrich) administered for 28 days using osmotic delivery pumps (model 2004;
Alzet) inserted subcutaneously into the backs of animals.
Kinase activity profiling. Protein Tyrosine Kinase (PTK) activity profiling was
performed using “Pamgene Station”. A total of 5 µg of protein extracted from liver
(10-week-old Ptprg−/− and Ptprg +/
+ fed on a standard diet) using RIPA buffer and
processed with PamChip4 microarray chips, provided by PamGene (PamGene
International, the Netherlands) and printed at their facilities.
Statistical analysis. Data sets were analyzed for statistical significance using
PRISM (GraphPad, San Diego, CA) for a two-tail unpaired Student’s t test when
two groups were compared or one-way ANOVA (Tukey’s post test) when three or
more groups were compared.
