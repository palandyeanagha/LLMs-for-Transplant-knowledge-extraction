Health status decline in α-1 antitrypsin
deficiency: a feasible outcome for disease
modifying therapies?

Abstract
Background: Trials of disease modifying therapies in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) provide
challenges for detecting physiological and patient centred outcomes. The purpose of the current study was to
monitor decline in health status in Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) and determine its’ relationship to
conventional physiology.
Methods: Patients recruited to the UK-AATD database with a median follow up of 7 years (IQR 5–10) were studied
to determine annual change in St George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), FEV1, gas transfer and their feasibility
of use in future trials.
Results: Annual decline in SGRQ had a wide range, was greater for patients with established COPD and correlated
with decline in FEV1 (p < 0.0001). Total score decline was greater (p < 0.05) for those with accelerated FEV1 decline
(median = 1.07 points/year) compared to those without (median = 0.51). Power calculations indicated effective
intervention would not achieve MCID for the SGRQ unless the timeframe was extended for up to 8 years. More
than 5000 patients/arm would be required for a statistically significant modest effect over 3 years even in those
with rapid FEV1 decline.
Conclusion: Despite AATD being a rapidly declining form of COPD, deterioration in SGRQ was slow consistent with
ageing and the chronic nature of disease progression. Power calculations indicate the numbers needed to detect a
difference with disease modifying therapies would be prohibitive especially in this rare cause of COPD. These data
have important implications for future study design of disease modifying therapies even in COPD not associated
with AATD.

Background
Unlike interventions that have short or medium term
effects in COPD (improvement in FEV1, health status or
reduction in exacerbations), therapies that modify disease
progression present greater challenges to objective and
subjective measures of efficacy. Physiological progression
has classically been characterised by FEV1 decline although
recent COPD studies indicated that not all patients decline
[1] leading to attempts to identify “rapid decliners” for
study enrichment by patient characteristics such as
Emphysema [2] biomarkers such as CC16 [3] or neu￾trophilic proteinase footprints [4].
Health related outcomes relate to both FEV1 [5] and
exacerbations [6]. A mean clinically important difference
(MCID) is defined for the Saint George’s Respiratory
Questionnaire (SGRQ), and is a preferred secondary and
co-primary outcome by the US Food and Drug Adminis￾tration (FDA) recognising its clinical relevance [7, 8].
However entry into clinical trials alone improves both
compliance and health status (HS) and clinical impact
has to be judged above this placebo effect.
Large COPD trials provide some evidence of disease
modification (slowing FEV1 decline) in post hoc analysis
of TORCH [9] and prospective analysis of SUMMIT

studies [10]. However in rarer conditions predisposing
to COPD, like Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD),
where treatments such as augmentation therapy might be
expected to modify disease progression, it is impractical to
deliver powered studies with conventional outcomes. The
number needed to determine the effect on FEV1 decline
is deemed prohibitive [11] so a more direct measure of
the pathology (emphysema progression) by Computed
Tomography has been accepted as a surrogate outcome
by the FDA [12]. Nevertheless despite consistent double
blind studies of disease modification [13–15] there remains
uncertainty about whether augmentation improves other
outcomes, such as HS, although there is observational
evidence that mortality is reduced [16].
Disease modification in COPD is becoming an important
pharmaceutical objective and several anti-inflammatory
and anti proteinase strategies are being developed and
undergoing phase1/2 testing. The delivery of phase 3
clinical trials needs to address the use of SGRQ in trial
design as outlined by the FDA [7, 8]. The purpose of
the current study was to determine whether HS defined
by the SGRQ could be employed as part of future AATD
trials to provide clearer evidence of patient benefit and
how the decline of lung physiology influences the SGRQ
decline in a cohort of closely monitored patients with
AATD never treated with antitrypsin augmentation
therapy.
Methods
The UK AATD registry collects extensive annual demo￾graphic data including post bronchodilator lung function
(to ERS /ARTP standard) and SGRQ as described [17].
All PiZZ patients (n = 454) where SGRQ was available
for at least 4 consecutive annual visits, were analysed.
The decline in SGRQ total score and the domains were
assessed by linear regression analysis to determine
change/year. Data was compared between GOLD stages
[18] and subgroups defined as non and rapid decliners
(≥1% predicted decline per year) for FEV1 and Kco as
described previously [19]. Lung function was normalised
for age, sex, height and ethnicity using the normal
ranges described [20]. All patients gave written consent
and the study had ethical approval (South Birmingham
LREC 3359a).
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis used STATA 14 (StataCorp LLC,
Texas, USA). A significance level of p < 0.05 was used
with single tailed tests. Data was not normally distrib￾uted, hence is expressed as median and interquartile
range. Correlations between baseline and longitudinal
SGRQ and pulmonary physiology were determined by
linear mixed modelling and differences between groups
assessed by Mann-Whitney two sample statistic (two
independent variables) and Kruskal Wallis (group wise
comparisons). Missing data underwent a case deletion if
greater than 5%.
Sample size calculations for a study with SGRQ as the
primary outcome together with potential physiological
outcomes were based upon a two group parallel compari￾son, using the formula n =1+2C (S/D)2 where D was the
smallest difference to be detected (a 25% change in SGRQ
decline was used as an arbitrary effect size for illustrative
purposes) and s represented the standard deviation of
the observations. C = 10.51 to provide a 90% power of
detecting a change in SGRQ at the 5% level of signifi￾cance. As the deterioration in HS was determined by
slope analysis over at least 4 annual assessments, power
would be relevant for a 3 year study.
Results
Patient cohort
Data was collected from 454 patients with AATD (PiZZ)
with median follow up of 7 years (IQR 5–10). Demo￾graphics of patients with and without airflow obstruction
(FEV1 /FVC ratio greater or less than 0.7) [18] are
shown in Table 1. The majority with airflow obstruction
were male (64%) and 89% were index cases diagnosed
due to respiratory symptoms. The majority were ex
smokers (81%):- no current smokers were included in
the analysis as there were too few to analyse meaning￾fully. Patients without COPD were mainly female (61%),
non index cases, never smokers and younger (Table 1).
There was a wide range of pulmonary function from
normal to very severe COPD (GOLD stage 4) also
reflected in the gas transfer results and SGRQ scores
for the groups with and without COPD.
Relationship between SGRQ and physiological parameters
The baseline SGRQ score for the whole group showed a
statistically significant (p < 0.0001) correlation with baseline
FEV1 although the r2 value of 0.34 indicated that only 34%
of the variability in the group was explained by FEV1 alone
(Fig. 1). The correlations for those with and without COPD
were also statistically significant (p < 0.0001) although
the variance for each group was less (r
2 = 0.20 and 0.15
respectively). Similar statistically significant correlations
were found between SGRQ total score and gas transfer
for the whole group (r
2 = 0.105; p < 0.0001) and those
with COPD (r
2 = 0.015; p = 0.008) but not those without
COPD (r
2 = 0.002; p = 0.35).
There was a wide range of FEV1 and Kco decline (%
predicted/year). Generally the SGRQ scores increased
yearly for the groups with and without COPD, although
again a wide range was seen (Table 1). The symptom
and activity score was stable for the non COPD group
even though the median total score showed gradual
deterioration (+ 0.21 units /year). The group with COPD
Stockley et al. Respiratory Research (2018) 19:137 Page 2 of 9

showed a worsening of symptoms and activity with time
and an overall median increase in total score of +
0.66 units/year although only the activity and total score
deteriorated more rapidly than for those without COPD
(p = 0.001 and p = 0.025 respectively). Figure 2 shows the
annual change in SGRQ and its domains in patients with
and without COPD, divided according to no or rapid
decline in FEV1 [19]. Summary data and demographics of
patients in each of these groups is provided in Additional
file 1: Tables S1 and S2. In addition the FEV1 and Kco
decline is summarised in Additional file 1: Tables S3a,
b and c for comparison with previous literature that
did not account for age sex and height.
There was no difference in the rate of gas transfer
decline between those with and without COPD (p = 0.125).
There was no relationship between SGRQ decline and gas
transfer decline (Additional file 1: Tables S4 and S5). The
decline in FEV1 was statistically related to the increase in
SGRQ total score for the whole group (Fig. 3; p < 0.0001),
although the relationship (r2 0.04) indicated only 4% of the
decline in HS was explained by the decline in FEV1 alone.
The decline in HS was greater in COPD patient with rapid
decline in FEV1 (%predicted) compared to those with
no decline although only for the total score and activity
domain (p < 0.05) as shown in supplementary e-Table 2.
The decline in SGRQ total score did not differ between
GOLD stages (Fig. 4).
Relationship between change in SGRQ and COPD
treatment
Forty eight % of patients without COPD and 2% of those
with COPD were not receiving long acting inhaled therapy.
The proportion receiving LABA, LAMA or ICS alone were
similar for those without and those with COPD (11% vs
19%: 9% vs 9%: and 4% vs 7% respectively). However, only
9% of those without COPD were on triple therapy
(LAMA/LABA/ICS) compared to 61% of those with
COPD. The high proportion of those without spirometric
COPD at the time of referral who were on regular inhaled
therapy largely reflects clinical practice at the time of

critical data on the effect of AATD on annual HS deteri￾oration over a period of 3 or more years in patients not
receiving augmentation therapy, thus reflecting the natural
history of the disease. It demonstrates that change in HS
relates poorly to physiological progression and that it
would not be feasible to establish a trial of disease modify￾ing therapy with SGRQ as a primary outcome. In addition
SGRQ is unlikely to provide direct clinical support as
a secondary outcome because the numbers required,
especially in this rare disease, are prohibitive.
Patterns of change in health status
Patients were divided into those with and without airflow
obstruction and all SGRQ domains and total score showed
a wide range of values though significantly worse for those
with COPD. However, even in those without COPD the
total score and especially the symptom domain score was
higher than expected in a healthy population [22]. This
likely reflects the proportion of patients in our study who
were “index” cases and hence diagnosed after presenting
with symptoms. Whereas these patients did not have
COPD by spirometric criteria we have shown previously
that in AATD the gas transfer can be reduced even in
subjects with normal spirometry and likely leads to refer￾ral and assessment [21]. This concept is consistent with
the lower scores in the non index Swedish birth cohort
who have been followed for up to 40 years where HS is
maintained and only a small number of current smokers
show HS or gas transfer impairment [23].
Changes in HS were greater in those with established
COPD, especially the activity score which increased
almost + 1.2 units/year, whilst total score change was
lower (+ 0.66/year) reflecting the lesser changes in
symptom and impact domains. The relationship to
GOLD stage indicated those with mild and moderate
COPD had the greatest median deterioration in total
SGRQ score although there was no statistical difference
across groups. Our previous studies had shown little
change in average SGRQ scores over 3 years [24] which
was at variance with a Dutch AATD study which
showed a major decline in total score (+ 6.5 units) over
30 months [25]. The difference likely reflects a combin￾ation of the centralisation of patient care and the degree of
monitoring carried out at our centre as well as potential
improvements in patient care over the intervening 14 years.
More recently a study from Germany [26] also docu￾mented a slow decline in SGRQ in AATD (+ 1.2 units for
total score) which weakly reflected annual exacerbation
rates [26]. However, that data was self-reported and

included unquantified patients with the SZ phenotype
and a significant proportion on augmentation therapy,
which may have influenced the results.
The SGRQ domains and total score showed little
change in patients with no airflow obstruction. However
there was a relationship to the FEV1 decline (% predicted):
those with rapid decline showed a greater median increase
in all domains and total score although the range was wide
and only significantly different for the symptom domain.
There were differences in the activity domain and total
scores when the COPD patients were divided into those
with no or rapid decline in FEV1. However, when divided
into those with rapid or no decline in gas transfer,
although the activity domains rose by median values of +
0.18 and + 1.17 units/year respectively, neither achieved
statistical significance (Additional file 1: Tables S4 and S5)
suggesting the rate of FEV1 decline has the more
noticeable effect on HS. Although there was an overall
(significant) correlation between FEV1 decline and SGRQ
deterioration, the relationship was weak (Fig. 3).
Relevance to clinical trial design
These data have important implications for clinical trials
of disease modifying therapies in AATD and non deficient
COPD. Age itself (without COPD) has an effect on HS
[22] although clearly from a lower baseline than in COPD.
AATD is considered a more rapidly progressive type of
COPD but even those with established COPD stratified
for rapid FEV1 decline had an overall median annual
increase in total SGRQ score that was only + 0.5 points
higher than those with no age corrected FEV1 decline.
Indeed even when stratified into moderate and severe
COPD (typical of patients currently included in clinical
trials) the differences remained small and statistically
insignificant.
Our data was generated from a specialised research
programme with annual follow up, which conceivably
has a similar placebo effect on HS to that seen in clinical
trials [27] and may reflect changes in patient expectations
as well as close monitoring and better adherence to back￾ground therapy [28]. Despite similar close monitoring,
many interventional trials in COPD demonstrate a greater
treatment effect on HS parameters (≥ MCID of 4 points
for SGRQ total score) which may reflect the nature of the
trials aimed at both short term improvement in lung func￾tion and modification of exacerbations (e.g. [29, 30]).
However, in trials of augmentation therapy in AATD to
date no signal has been detected either statistically or
close to the MCID [13–15] leading to scepticism about
efficacy despite significant effects on emphysema pro￾gression [31]. This failure may reflect both the size of
the studies in this rare condition and the lack of any
immediate improvement in lung function (and hence a
noticeable clinical signal) for disease modifying treatments
like augmentation.
We observed a slow deterioration in SGRQ scores in
patients not receiving augmentation therapy, indicating
that detection of slowing of HS decline in clinical trials
aimed at disease modification is likely to require very
large numbers for adequate power. If augmentation
stopped all HS decline it would still require at least a
4 year study in rapid FEV1 decliners to achieve the
MCID for total SGRQ score. Our data shows that even
those with stable FEV1 have an annual deterioration in

HS which is half that of the rapid FEV1 decliners indicating
that a study to find a median 4 point effect of treatment
that stopped the physiological related decline would take
about 8 years.
In the current study we calculated the number needed
to confirm a 25% reduction in SGRQ total score decline
which, even in pre-identified rapid decliners with COPD
(5039 / arm) is prohibitive for a “rare” disease, especially
when most identified patients are already on widely
accepted AAT augmentation therapy. To detect an SGRQ
decline reduced to that seen in COPD patients with a
stable age related decline (50% reduction) would still
require 1260/arm if treatment were totally effective. Using
slope analysis allows projections of the longer term benefit
on HS decline, but would still require at least 3 years for
decline to be documented and would still not reduce
patients required in such a trial to a feasible number.
Slope analysis of health status was preferred to endpoint
analysis to overcome any potential regression to the mean
resulting in an apparent improvement in scores overtime
[32] and at the same time allow more robust longitudinal
projection of the changes to determine time to MCID.
Since SGRQ appeared prohibitive as a primary or
secondary outcome we also conducted power calculations
for a prospective study using both FEV1 and Kco as the
outcome. Again the numbers appear prohibitive for
unselected patients with AATD and COPD. However, the
numbers become more feasible if patients were chosen by
known rate of rapid physiological decline (Table 2) i.e.
enriching the study population for the outcome being
assessed. This approach could be considered for both a
pragmatic clinical trial and, in the interim, as a criterion
for assessing treatment response [19]. Interestingly the
power calculations form a rank order consistent with
previously published data on the sensitivity of these 3
parameters to change [33].
Potential strengths and weaknesses
The current study has a potential weakness. It represents
a cohort of patients referred to a specialist centre for
annual long term follow up as a research programme.
Thus it will not represent “usual” clinical care and a
degree of selection bias cannot be discounted. However,
this is also a strength as the patients and their manage￾ment likely represent those who would be suitable for,
and included in, clinical trials. The results therefore
represent what impact a focussed clinical service has on
HS and its deterioration and are therefore relevant to the
design of trials of disease modifying therapies in AATD
where placebo arms should achieve similar results.
Equivalent data will also be important in non AATD
COPD as use of disease modifying therapies expand to
this patient group.
As we were studying HS decline we only included
patients in whom this had been documented on at least
4 annual visits. Some patients may not have had this
recorded and some may not have returned on at least 4
occasions either because they had become reassured of
their physiological “normality” of a combination of
distance travelled with and without increased morbidity
with time. Nevertheless this selections criterion did not
differ with disease severity suggesting it is generally
reflective of the patient groups.
The insensitivities of both group physiological data and
HS, to change [33] has been an important driving force in
the development and validation of CT densitometry as the
outcome of choice in emphysema trials especially in
AATD. Although lung densitometry relates to both FEV1
and SGRQ cross-sectionally and remains the best pre￾dictor of Mortality [34] only the decline in FEV1 has been
shown to relate to the decline in lung Density [35].
Whether density decline shows a similar relationship to
SGRQ deterioration has not been assessed but such
studies may provide indirect evidence of any putative,
clinically apparent, benefit that would not be detected
by current trial design and power.
Conclusion
Although HS relates to baseline lung physiology and its
decline, the changes are minimal with time even in those
with documented rapid physiological decline. These data
support the role of close patient supervision and moni￾toring in a specialist clinic and provides fuel for debate
about trial designs to assess therapeutic efficacy of
COPD disease modification with HS as an outcome.
