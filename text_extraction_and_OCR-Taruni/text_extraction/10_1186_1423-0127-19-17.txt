Abstract
Background: Naturally occurring pre-S deletion mutants have been identified in hepatitis B carriers and shown to
be associated with the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. The phenotypes of these pre-S deletion
genomes remain unclear, and they were investigated in this study.
Methods: The pre-S deletion genomes: (1) pre-S1 deletion, (2) deletion spanning pre-S1 and pre-S2, (3) pre-S2 N￾terminal deletion, and (4) pre-S2 internal deletion were constructed and analyzed by transfection into Huh-7 cells.
Results: Functional analyses reveal that these mutants were divided into two groups: S promoter deletion and
non-S promoter deletion variants. Compared with the wild-type genome, S promoter deletion variants led to an
inverse ratio of pre-S1 mRNA and pre-S2/S mRNA, and intracellular accumulation of surface proteins. An interesting
finding is that a small amount of L proteins was detected in the medium from S promoter deletion variant￾transfected cells. Non-S promoter deletion variants conversely displayed a wild-type like mRNA and protein pattern.
The secretion of surface proteins from non-S promoter deletion variants was inhibited less than from S promoter
deletion variant. Immunofluorescence analysis showed mutant surface proteins colocalized with ER and exhibited
an atypical distribution: granular staining pattern in the S-promoter deletion variants and perinuclear staining
pattern in the non-S promoter deletion variants.
Conclusion: This study shows that these pre-S deletion genomes exhibit two different phenotypes in mRNA
transcription, surface protein expression and secretion. This diversity seems to result from the deletion of S
promoter rather than result from the deletion of pre-S1 or pre-S2.

Background
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a small, enveloped DNA virus
that causes acute and chronic liver diseases. The major￾ity of acute HBV infections are usually self-limited,
whereas patients with chronic HBV infection usually
pursue a life-long course. The clinical consequences of
chronic HBV infection include chronic carrier state,
chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carci￾noma (HCC) [1,2]. Host, viral factors and their interac￾tions contribute to the progression of liver disease.
HBV has four open reading frames that encode ×
protein, DNA polymerase, core, and surface protein.
The viral surface proteins compose of three different,
yet structurally related surface proteins from a single
open reading frame, named large (L), middle (M), and
small (S) protein. The S protein is 226 amino acids
(aa) in length, and the M and L protein are assembled
by amino-terminal extension of 55 aa of the pre-S2
domain and of 163 to 174 aa (depending on the strain)
of the pre-S (pre-S1 and pe-S2) domain, respectively
[3]. The functions of the pre-S region have been stu￾died previously and summarized in Figure 1A. The
pre-S domain of L surface protein plays vital roles in
the viral life cycle by e-pre-S (external in secreted
envelope) to mediate the attachment of HBV to liver

cells, by i-pre-S (internal in the secreted envelope) to
perform a matrix-like function in nucleocapsid envel￾opment, and by exerting various regulatory functions
[4-13]. Conversely, the M protein has been demon￾strated to be functionally nonessential for viral assem￾bly or DNA replication. The pre-S2 domain of M
protein could bind to polymerized human serum albu￾min (pHSA) (aa 3-16), but the significance of this
binding is unknown [13].
Due to the spontaneous error rate of viral polymerase,
HBV genome evolves during the course of infection
under the antiviral pressure of the host immunity or
specific therapy [14]. Previously, it was reported that
patients with progressive liver diseases including HCC
had a higher frequency of pre-S deletions [15]. Sequen￾cing analysis found the deletions happened more fre￾quently in 3’ terminus of pre-S1 and 5’-terminus of pre￾S2 regions. Functional mapping of these pre-S deletion
Figure 1 Map of HBV pre-S region and viral genomes. (A) Functional domains within the HBV pre-S region. The pre-S region consists of the
pre-S1 and pre-S2 domains. The pre-S1 domain contains 119 amino acids (used in this study) and is further divided into two parts, N half (aa 1
to 57) and C half (aa 58 to 119). The pre-S2 domain contains 55 amino acids. The pre-S domain contains multiple functions as shown. N-half of
pre-S1 contains hepatocyte binding site essential for infection. C-half of pre-S1 contains a site important for dual topology of L proteins and a
nucleocapsid binding site for virion morphogenesis. C-half of pre-S1 also contains S-promoter necessary for expression of S gene. Pre-S2 domain

sequences showed most of deletion mutants lost one or
more of functional sites (shown in Figure 1A), such as
pHSA site, nucleocapsid binding site, site for dual topol￾ogy, S-promoter, and the start codon of M protein.
Until now, only a few naturally occurring HBV pre-S1
or pre-S2 internal deletion mutants were cloned and
characterized functionally in full-length genome [16-20].
Studies of pre-S1 deletion genomes showed a decrease
of pre-S2/S transcripts and an inverse increase of pre-S1
transcripts [16-18]. The impacts of pre-S1 deletion on
virion secretion are controversial; two groups showed
release virion particles [16,17], but not the other group
[18]. Conversely, pre-S2 internal deletion mutants have
no effect in RNA transcription, DNA replication, or vir￾ion secretion [19]. Furthermore, both pre-S1 and pre-S2
internal deletion mutants have been reported to cause
the accumulation of large surface protein in the endo￾plasmic reticulum (ER), and lead to ER stress [19,21,22].
It was suggested that large amounts of reactive oxygen
species are generated through ER stress, and they cause
oxidative DNA damage, induce mutagenesis in the gen￾ome, and ultimately result in HCC [23].
So far, the functional analysis were restricted in pre-S1
deletion and pre-S2 internal deletion, but the extensive
functional studies of full-length genomes with N term￾inal pre-S2 deletion or pre-S deletion spanning pre-S1
and pre-S2 are absent. In this study, four different types
of pre-S deletion mutants (Figure 1B) associated with
development of hepatocellular carcinoma: (1) pre-S1
deletion (dpS1), (2) deletion spanning pre-S1 and pre-S2
(dpS12a and dpS12b), (3) pre-S2 N-terminal deletion
(dpS2a), and (4) pre-S2 internal deletion (dpS2b) were
selected to investigate their impacts on HBV RNA tran￾scription, viral protein expression, surface protein secre￾tion, and intracellular location of surface proteins.
Methods
Pre-S deletion subgenomes
The pre-S deletion subgenomes (genotype Ba) derived
from five sera of patients with HCC infected with HBV
were investigated [15]. The pre-S deletion subgenomes
were amplified, cloned into T&A vector (Real Biotech
Co., Taipei County, Taiwan), and sequenced as
described previously [15,24]. These mutants were
divided into four types based on the region deleted (Fig￾ure 1B). Type I, the dpS1 mutant has a deletion in the
C terminus of pre-S1 region (61 amino acids, aa 58-
118). Type II, the dpS12a and dpS12b have a deletion
spanning pre-S1 and pre-S2 region. Type III (dpS2a)
deletes the N-terminal 12 amino acids of pre-S2. Type
IV (dpS2b) is a pre-S2 internal deletion. Based on func￾tional mapping of sequences, two (dpS1 and dpS12a)
losing the S promoter were classified as S promoter (SP)
deletion variant; the other three (dpS12b, dpS2a, and
dpS2b) still having S promoter were classified as non-S
promoter (Non-SP) deletion variant. In addition, three
(dpS12a, dpS12b, and dpS2a) deleted the start codon of
M surface protein.
Cloning of wild-type and pre-S deletion genomes
Plasmid of wild-type HBV replication-competent gen￾ome containing a 1.2-mer HBV genome unit lengths
was constructed from a wild-type genotype Ba plasmid
(B8w, a generous gift from Dr. Chun-Jen Liu, containing
full length HBV genome). Briefly, wild-type genome was
constructed by tri-mer ligation. BamHI-XbaI (nt 1394-
204) and XbaI-BglII (nt 204-1989) HBV fragments were
cloned into BamHI-PstI double digested pGEM-4z vec￾tor. Five different pre-S deletion replication-competent
HBV genomes were made by insertion of the Bbs I frag￾ment with a pre-S deletion into the wild-type genome
following digestion with the BbsI restriction enzymes,
respectively. All of restriction enzymes were provided
from New England Biolabs.
Cell culture and transfection
Huh-7 cells were grown at 37°C under 5% CO2 in Dul￾becco’s modified Eagle medium, supplemented with 10%
FCS (Gibco Invitrogen Corporation, USA) and 2% L￾glutamine. The cells were plated at a density of 1 × 106
cells per 60-mm dish or 5 × 105 cells per well in 6-well
plates 24 hours prior to transfection. Transfection of
cells was performed with lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen
Life Technologies, CA) following the user guidelines.
Cotransfections with enhanced green fluorescent protein
(EGFP) reporter plasmid were performed, and the
amount of EGFP synthesized was quantified using fluo￾rometer to normalize the transfection efficiency. Cells
were harvested at day 3 post-transfection. Calculation of
transfection efficiency was performed as follows: equiva￾lent number of viable cells was taken and lysed, and
then intracellular EGFP fluorescence was measured. The
EGFP in cell culture medium was also measured to
examine the possibility of cell lysis. The relative volume
of medium from equivalent number of live cells was
taken and used to determine the EGFP fluorescence.
The presence of cell lysis was calculated by extracellular
fluorescence divided by intracellular fluorescence.
Western-blot analysis of intracellular HBV surface and
core proteins
Proteins of transfected cells were harvested, separated
in 12% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to PVDF
membranes. The membrane was incubated with the
primary antibody, and then was incubated with the
second antibody, which was conjugated with horserad￾ish peroxidase. The proteins were detected by using
ECL chemiluminescence kit (Perkin-Elmer Life

Science, Boston, MA). Loading of equal protein
amounts was controlled with an anti-actin antibody
(Millipore, USA). The primary antibodies used for
Western-blot were as follows: anti-HBs; anti-pre-S1,
MA18/7, a generous gift from Dr. Gerlich; anti-HBV
core, kindly provided by Dr. Hui-Lin Wu (Hepatitis
Research Center, National Taiwan University Hospital,
Taiwan). Since the anti-HBc was raised by recombi￾nant HBV core protein, it could detect HBV core
(MW = 21 kDa) and HBeAg (MW = 15-18 kDa).
When the culture supernatant was analyzed, the anti￾HBc recognizes the HBeAg more efficiently.
Extracellular secretion of HBV surface and e proteins in
culture supernatants
The amounts of HBV surface proteins (HBsAg) and e
protein (HBeAg) in culture supernatants were quantified
by using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) kit (SURASE b-96 and EASE BN-96 kit, Gen￾eral Biologicals CORP., HSIN-CHU, Taiwan). The
supernatants were diluted to keep the amount of HBsAg
and HBeAg within the linear range of the assay. All
transfections and quantitations were repeated indepen￾dently at least three times.
The surface proteins and HBeAg in the culture super￾natant were concentrated by Amicon Ultra-4 centrifugal
filter devices (Millipore, USA) and performed the Wes￾tern-blot analysis as described above.
Northern blot analysis
Total RNA was extracted from transfected cells with
TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, USA) following the manu￾facturer’s instructions. Five μg RNA were separated by
electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel and transferred to a
nylon membrane. The blot was probed with a DIG￾labeled full-length DNA HBV probe. The probe was
generated with a PCR DIG Probe Synthesis kit (Roche
Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). Detection
was done using the DIG luminescent detection kit
(Roche), and bands were quantitatively analyzed with
the Image J software.
Immunofluorescence studies
The transfected cells were grown on chamber slides,
washed two times in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at
4°C, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. After a block￾ing reaction with 3% BSA, cells were incubated with pri￾mary antibodies against pre-S1, S and endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) membrane: anti-Calnexin antibody (Cell
Signaling technology, Inc., USA) prior to incubation
with secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 488-labeled anti￾mouse IgG and Alexa Fluor 594-labeled anti-rabbit
IgG). The nuclei of the cells were counterstained with 1
μg/ml of Hoechst 33258 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Images
were examined under an Olympus fluorescent
microscope.
Results
Viral mRNA levels
To determine the effect of pre-S deletions on HBV tran￾scripts, the HBV RNA levels were analyzed by North￾ern-blot hybridization of total cellular RNA. A
representative blot is shown in Figure 2; all five variants
showed similar levels of 3.5 kb pg/preC RNA compared
with the control wild-type genome.
As expected, in S promoter (SP) deletion variants
(dpS1 and dpS12a), the levels of pre-S2/S mRNA were
decreased and the amounts of pre-S1 mRNA were
increased compared with the wild-type genome. Non-S
promoter (Non-SP) deletion mutants (dpS12b, dpS2a,
and dpS2b) conversely showed almost equal levels of
total pre-S1 and pre-S2/S mRNAs, pre-S1 mRNA, and
pre-S2/S mRNA when compared with the wild-type
genome.
Viral protein expression: intracellular retention of surface
proteins
Based on the results of ELISA, a reduced secretion of
surface proteins (HBsAg) was reproducibly found from
pre-S deletion mutants compared with the wild-type
virus, especially from SP deletion mutants (Figure 3A).
However, the secretion of another HBV antigen, HBeAg,
was less affected (Figure 3A). Since ELISA detects all
three (L, M, and S) HBV surface proteins, in order to
gain a better resolution, the Western blot analysis using
specific antibodies to identify each individual surface
protein was performed.
Two monoclonal antibodies were used: (1) anti-HBs
is S-specific, and it detects all three (L, M, and S) pro￾teins; (2) anti-pre-S1 is specific for the L protein; the
blot was first detected with anti-HBs, stripped, and
reprobed with anti-preS1. As shown in Figure 3B,
compared with wild-type genome, the SP deletion
mutants showed a significantly decreased amount of S
protein but similar (dpS1) or lower (dpS12a) level of
intracellular L protein (Figure 3B-C). In addition, the
secretions of L proteins were remarkably low. Conver￾sely, the Non-SP deletion mutants showed slightly
higher levels of intracellular S and L proteins and a
slightly decreased amount of extracellular S proteins
(Figure 3B-C). Most surprisingly, the extracellular L
proteins for Non-SP deletion mutants looked less
abundant than wild-type L proteins in the anti-HBs
blot, but not in the anti-pre-S1 blot (Figure 3B, anti￾HBs and anti-pre-S1 panels). The lack of recognition
of mutant L proteins by the anti-HBs was probably

due to the alteration of immunogenicity of S domain.
Another surprise was that the intracellular mutant L
proteins exhibited a more heterogeneous and had addi￾tional L proteins with a higher molecular weight than
expected, which might be di-, and tri-glycosylated L
proteins (Figure 3B, anti-pre-S1 panel). As an internal
control, intracellular core proteins or extracellular
HBeAg were measured and found to be similar
between wild-type HBV and pre-S deletion mutants
(Figure 3B, core and HBeAg panels).

Intracellular localization of HBV surface proteins in pre-S
deletion mutant’s transfected cells
To investigate the intracellular location of the surface pro￾teins, double-immunofluorescence staining with cellular
proteins of ER compartment was performed (Figure 4).
Cells transfected with wild-type constructs showed a dif￾fuse and homogenous staining pattern of surface proteins.
In contrast, a granular staining of surface proteins was
observed for SP deletion variant-transfected cells (dpS1
and dpS12a). The results for Non-SP deletion variants
(dpS12b, dpS2a, and dpS2b) were different from those of
wild-type and SP deletion constructs. The distribution of
surface proteins showed a perinuclear staining pattern. The
staining patterns of calnexin (ER) seemed to be changed by
transfecting with different pre-S deletion mutants. It is not
surprising since previous study showed that the L proteins
colocalized with and bind to calnexin [25], the distribution
of calnexin would be changed by mutant L proteins.
Discussion
Recently many studies demonstrated the association of
pre-S deletion with the development of progressive liver
disease [15,22,26-28]; however, most of molecular char￾acteristics of these pre-S deletion genomes remain
unknown. In this study, we analyzed the phenotype of
five naturally occurring pre-S deletion mutants: one
(dpS1) is pre-S1 deletion mutant; two (dpS12a and
dpS12b) delete the border between pre-S1 and pre-S2;
one is pre-S2 N terminal deletion mutant (dpS2a); one
is pre-S2 internal deletion mutant (dpS2b). Based on
functional mapping of pre-S sequences, they are also
divided into two groups: two (dpS1 and dpS12a) are S
promoter (SP) deletion variants, and three (dpS12b,
dpS2a, and dpS2b) are non-S promoter (Non-SP) dele￾tion variants. The Northern blot experiments showed
that all pre-S deletion genomes produced comparable
amounts of pregenomic RNA as found for the wt HBV
construct. However, an altered transcription with
reduced levels of pre-S2/S mRNA was found in S pro￾moter deletion variants. It is known that the surface
gene of HBV is controlled by 2 different promoters: the
pre-S1 and the S promoter, which regulate the tran￾scription of 2.4-kb pre-S1 mRNA and 2.1-kb pre-S2/S
mRNA, respectively. The pre-S1 promoter is located 5’

Huh-7 cells were first seeded on the chamber slide and incubated at 37°C overnight. After transient transfection of wild-type and pre-S deletion
mutants, the slides were stained with monoclonal antibodies against pre-S1, anti-pre-S1 and S, anti-HBs. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of the
cells was double-immunostained with anti-calnexin antibody. The nuclei of the cells were counterstained with Hoechst. Images were examined
under an Olympus fluorescent microscope (original magnifications x200).

of the first in-frame ATG of the L surface protein and
regulated by at least two liver-enriched transcription fac￾tors, HNF-1 and HNF-3. The S promoter is a TATA￾less promoter and found within the coding region of the
pre-S1 region. It is reported that a CCAAT element in
the S promoter and its 3’ terminus are essential for
high-level expression of 2.1-kb pre-S2/S mRNA [29].
Furthermore, previous study demonstrated that this
CCAAT element could not only increase the amount of
pre-S2/S transcripts, but also decrease the amount of
pre-S1 transcripts [30]. Therefore, deletion of this ele￾ment would decrease the amount of pre-S2/S transcript,
increase the amount of pre-S1 transcript, and cause an
inverse ratio of pre-S1 mRNA to pre-S2/S mRNA.
Indeed, two S promoter deletion variants (dpS1 and
dpS12a) caused a decrease of pre-S2/S transcripts and
an inverse ratio of pre-S1 mRNA to pre-S2/S mRNA, as
expected. Conversely, when non-S promoter deletion
variants (dpS12b, dpS2a, and dpS2b) were transfected,
the ratio of pre-S1 mRNA to pre-S2/S mRNA was simi￾lar between wt genome and variants.
Synthesis and secretion of surface proteins also
showed two different patterns. The phenotype of the
non-S promoter deletion mutants (dpS12b, dpS2a, and
dpS2b) did not appear to differ significantly from wild￾type with respect to intracellular and extracellular abun￾dance of S and L protein (Figure 3A and 3B, lane 5-7
vs. lane 2). Conversely, in S promoter deletion variant￾transfected cells, Western-blot analysis showed that the
synthesis of S proteins was relatively lower, the M pro￾teins were undetectable, and intracellular accumulation
of mutant L proteins were serious (Figure 3B, lane 3-4
vs. lane 2 and Figure 3C). This phenomenon is expected
and similar to previous studies [16-18,21]. Intracellular
accumulation of L surface proteins results from the fact
that the L surface protein cannot be secreted by itself. It
needs to complex with S and M proteins to form sub￾viral particles or mature virions for secretion [31]. The
behavior of L proteins depends on the relative amounts
of the various surface proteins: a small relative amount
of L surface protein results in secretion, while a large
amount results in retention. Therefore, low level of S
protein and absence of M protein would lead to intra￾cellular retention of mutant L proteins.
It is surprising that a small amount of mutant L pro￾teins could be detected in the medium from S promoter
deletion variant-transfected cells by Western blotting
using anti-pre-S1 antibody. The simplest explanation is
that the extracellular mutant L proteins were due to cell
lysis rather than secretion of enveloped viral particles.
To examine this possibility, cells were cotransfected
with a plasmid that expresses a nonsecretable EGFP
(enhanced green fluorescent protein) protein, and then
the amount of EGFP released from cells was quantified
by a fluorometer. Very little EGFP was released into the
medium from S promoter deletion variant-transfected
cells (less than 0.05% of the amount within the cells),
and the amount was identical to the amount found in
the medium from wild-type HBV and vector-transfected
cells. These results indicated that the extracellular L
proteins would not come from cell lysis. Furthermore,
similar mutants with S promoter deletion were shown
to secrete viral particles by immunoprecipitation and
Southern blotting analysis of the culture supernatants
[16,17]. Therefore, the extracellular L proteins may be
derived from extracellular mature virion. Another sur￾prise is that the S promoter deletion mutants (dpS1 and
dpS12a) showed increased pre-S1 mRNA (Figure 2A
and 2C), but no increase in intracellular mutant L pro￾teins in Figure 3B (lane 3-4 vs. lane 2). The reason for
this difference is probably due to the posttranscriptional
regulation. One possible explanation for the decrease in
mutant L proteins is that these mutant proteins were
transported to proteasomal degradation. Simsek et al.
showed that the failure to process N-glycan caused the
glycosylated and unglycosylated L and M surface pro￾teins to aggregate and get degraded by proteasomal
degradation pathways [32]. Indeed, Western-blot analy￾sis showed that intracellular mutant L proteins exhibited
a more heterogeneous and had additional L proteins
with a higher molecular weight than expected, which
might be di-, and tri-glycosylated L proteins (Figure 3B,
anti-pre-S1 panel). The reduction of intracellular mutant
L proteins might be resulted from the proteasomal
degradation of misfolded unglycosylated and glycosy￾lated L proteins.
Immunofluorescence analysis showed that mutant sur￾face proteins colocalized with the ER and revealed an
atypical distribution: a granular staining in the S-promo￾ter deletion variants and a perinuclear staining pattern
in the non-S promoter deletion variants. Previously,
Wang et al. identified two types of ground glass hepato￾cytes (GGHs) and found that type I GGHs consistently
harbored mutants with deletion over the pre-S1 region
(Δ1), whereas type II GGHs contained mutants with
deletions over the pre-S2 region (Δ2) [33]. They cloned
these pre-S subgenomes and found that these deletion
mutants accumulated the surface proteins in endoplas￾mic reticulum (ER) resulting in strong ER stress. They
suggested that large amounts of reactive oxygen species
are generated through ER stress, and they cause oxida￾tive DNA damage, induce mutagenesis in genome, and
ultimately result in HCC [23]. The morphology of the S
promoter and non-S promoter deletion variants is simi￾lar to that observed in Δ1 and Δ2 mutants respectively.
To examine whether ER stress was induced in our pre-S
deletion mutant-transfected cells, the synthesis of ER￾stress signal proteins (grp78, IRE1a, and grp94) was
Lin et al. Journal of Biomedical Science 2012, 19:17

analyzed by Western-blot analysis. The results showed
that wt HBV genome and pre-S deletion mutants had
an enhanced expression level of ER stress signal proteins
compared with negative control-vector transfected cells
(data not shown). Therefore, these HCC-associated pre￾S deletion mutants might behave like the Δ1 and Δ2
subgenomes, causing the mutated surface proteins accu￾mulated in ER, resulting in the ground glass morphology
and inducing physiological stress, which may lead to
cancer formation finally.
The biological significance of pre-S deletion mutants
been explored and suggested that different type of pre-S
deletion mutants may exhibit differential biological
activities [22]. Su et al. proposed that pre-S deletion
mutants can induce ER stress signals, which may result
in oxidative stress and DNA damage, and lead to geno￾mic instability. These pre-S deletion mutants may also
activate two signal pathways to prevent the hepatocytes
from apoptosis, one involving NF-B to upregulate
cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and the other using VEGF to
activate Akt/mammalian target of Rapamycin (mTOR)
signaling [34]. Pre-S2 internal deletion mutant can addi￾tionally induce an ER stress-independent c-Jun activa￾tion domain binding protein 1 (JAB1)/p27/
retinoblastoma (Rb)/adenovirus E2 promoter binding
factor/cyclin A signal to initiate cell cycle progression.
Besides, pre-S deletion often occurred in B-cell and
HLA-restricted cytotoxic T cell epitopes. These dele￾tions might cause alteration of immune target sites, lead
to escape from immune surveillance or reduced binding
affinity by MHC I-mediated presentation of modified
oligopeptides on the cell surface of hepatocytes, and
result in persistent infection.
Conclusions
This study demonstrates that these pre-S deletion
mutants exhibit two altered phenotype, and the diversity
seems to result from deletion of the S promoter. Func￾tional analysis of full-length pre-S deletion genomes
would not only promote the progress in viral knowledge
and pathogenesis, but also help us to battle this enemy.
However, definitive answers regarding the role of these
mutants in hepatocarcinogenesis await further experi￾ments in the primary hepatocytes or animal models.
