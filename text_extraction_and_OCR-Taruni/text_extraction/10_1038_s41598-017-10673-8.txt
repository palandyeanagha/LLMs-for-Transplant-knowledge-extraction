Mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake has a key role in cellular Ca2+ homeostasis. Excessive matrix Ca2+
concentrations, especially when coincident with oxidative stress, precipitate opening of an inner 
mitochondrial membrane, high-conductance channel: the mitochondrial permeability transition 
pore (mPTP). mPTP opening has been implicated as a final cell death pathway in numerous diseases 
and therefore understanding conditions dictating mPTP opening is crucial for developing targeted 
therapies. Here, we have investigated the impact of mitochondrial metabolic state on the probability 
and consequences of mPTP opening. Isolated mitochondria were energised using NADH- or FADH2-
linked substrates. The functional consequences of Ca2+-induced mPTP opening were assessed by 
Ca2+ retention capacity, using fluorescence-based analysis, and simultaneous measurements of 
mitochondrial Ca2+ handling, membrane potential, respiratory rate and production of reactive oxygen 
species (ROS). Succinate-induced, membrane potential-dependent reverse electron transfer sensitised 
mitochondria to mPTP opening. mPTP-induced depolarisation under succinate subsequently inhibited 
reverse electron transfer. Complex I-driven respiration was reduced after mPTP opening but sustained 
in the presence of complex II-linked substrates, consistent with inhibition of complex I-supported 
respiration by leakage of matrix NADH. Additionally, ROS generated at complex III did not sensitise 
mitochondria to mPTP opening. Thus, cellular metabolic fluxes and metabolic environment dictate 
mitochondrial functional response to Ca2+ overload.
Mitochondria are capable of oxidising numerous substrates based on availability and metabolic demand. The 
delivery of energetic substrates to mitochondria provides reducing equivalents required for serial reduction of 
electron transport chain (ETC) redox centres. These redox reactions are coupled to expulsion of protons from the 
matrix into the intermembrane space (IMS)1
. The resulting proton electrochemical gradient (Δp), comprising a 
membrane potential (ΔΨm) and pH gradient, is necessary for the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) 
and metabolite transport through the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM)2, 3
.
The functions of mitochondria extend beyond that of cellular ATP biosynthesis. Indeed, mitochondria partic￾ipate in multiple regulatory signalling pathways stimulated in response to both physiological and pathophysio￾logical stimuli. As key regulators of cell death pathways, mitochondria also play a critical role in determining cell 
fate4, 5
. Thorough understanding of the (patho)physiological conditions mediating these homeostatic outcomes 
is important to help develop new therapeutic agents for a number of diseases including Parkinson’s Disease and 
stroke6–8

Mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake plays an important role in cellular homeostasis, being driven by the maintenance 
of ΔΨm
5, 9
. The mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) is a presumed proteinaceous entity in the 
IMM. Pore opening has generally been attributed to a structural change in a protein embedded within the mem￾brane, which, under other conditions, seems to usually perform a physiological role10, 11. The precise molecular 
composition and identity of the mPTP is highly controversial but candidates include the adenine nucleotide 
translocase (ANT), the voltage dependent anion channel (VDAC), spastic paraplegia 7 (SPG7), phosphate carrier 
(PiC) and components of the ATP synthase12–17. Recent observations have further complicated structural under￾standing of the mPTP complex in that He el al., challenging previous claims15, 18 recently demonstrated intact 
permeability transition in the absence of membrane and C-ring subunits of the ATP synthase19.
To date, the only unequivocally identified component of the pore complex is cyclophilin D (CypD), a matrix 
cyclophilin that regulates pore opening, conferring sensitivity of the pore to inhibition by cyclosporin A (CsA)20, 21. 
Failure of cellular Ca2+ homeostasis and consequent mitochondrial Ca2+ overload is the principal trigger for 
mitochondrial mPTP opening22. High-conductance mPTP opening is associated with osmotic swelling, loss of 
IMM potential, uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation and metabolic collapse4, 22–25.
As mPTP opening is a determinant of cell death in an ever-growing list of diseases, it is important for clinical 
benefit to understand pathways culminating in pore opening to identify effective interventions preventing or 
limiting pore opening26–29. To explore the impact of different metabolic conditions on the probability of pore 
opening, fluorescence-based analysis coupled to high-resolution respirometry was used to simultaneously meas￾ure mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, ΔΨm, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and respiration. The threshold 
of mPTP opening was assessed under distinct metabolic conditions by measuring the Ca2+ buffering capacity of 
isolated mitochondria. Characterisation of the relationship between substrate utilisation, oxygen consumption 
and sensitivity to pore opening will reveal events that precede and follow mPTP opening. Here, we report vari￾ation in mitochondrial sensitivity to Ca2+-induced mPTP opening based on the source of electron flux through 
the respiratory chain, as driven by different metabolic substrates, identifying mechanisms by which energetic state 
determines the mitochondrial response to Ca2+ overload.
Results
Influence of mitochondrial metabolic substrate availability on mPTP opening. Mitochondria 
are capable of metabolising several different metabolic substrates. To understand how substrate availability deter￾mines the probability of mPTP opening, a Ca2+ retention capacity protocol adapted to simultaneously monitor 
multiple parameters was established using the FLIPRTETRA high content kinetic assay system. Using this assay, 
mPTP opening was identified as the release of mitochondrially sequestered Ca2+, the failure of mitochondrial 
Ca2+ uptake (measured using the low affinity calcium indicator Fluo-4FF) and the collapse of the mitochondrial 
membrane potential (measured using TMRM).
Mitochondrial suspensions were energised using mechanistically distinct substrate combinations: (1) gluta￾mate/malate, (2) succinate or (3) succinate/rotenone. Under all metabolic conditions, initial aliquots of added 
Ca2+ (10 µM) were effectively removed from the extra-mitochondrial solution by mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake 
(Fig. 1a: insert 1) with no measurable effect on ΔΨm (Fig. 1b). Greater Ca2+ loads (concentrations above a thresh￾old) caused mPTP opening and simultaneous collapse of ΔΨm under all metabolic conditions (Fig. 1a: insert 2 
and Fig. 1b). However, strikingly, mitochondria oxidising glutamate/malate tolerated significantly greater Ca2+
loads, compared to those oxidising succinate and succinate/rotenone (Fig. 1a and c) which began to deviate 
from the glutamate/malate condition following 3–4 injections of calcium (Fig. 1e). A decrease of ΔΨm occurred 
significantly earlier in mitochondria energised with glutamate/malate compared to those metabolising succinate 
(Fig. 1b and d): deviation from the succinate condition occurred following just 1–2 calcium additions and prior 
to overt mPTP opening (as judged by Ca2+ retention assay; Fig. 1f). Addition of the complex I inhibitor rotenone 
to succinate-energised mitochondria significantly delayed mPTP opening over controls (Fig. 1c). Cyclosporin 
A (CsA) is a potent inhibitor of cyclophilin D (CypD), the well-established blocker of mPTP opening30. Under 
all metabolic conditions tested, mPTP opening was delayed by CsA and ΔΨm was maintained (Fig. 1a,b, 
Supplementary Figure 1). Independent of the metabolic substrate employed, CsA caused a dose-dependent delay 
in mPTP opening. IC50 values for CsA between substrates ranged from 86–92 nM (Table 1 and Supplementary 
Figure 1). Together, these data suggest that mitochondrial substrate utilisation influences the threshold required 
for Ca2+ to induce mPTP opening and has no effect of CsA potency of action.
Effect of metabolic substrate availability on bioenergetic consequences of mPTP opening. We 
next aimed to understand the consequences of the loss of mitochondrial inner membrane integrity on respiratory 
chain electron flow and to explore how metabolic substrate selectivity influences the bioenergetic consequences of 
mPTP opening. Simultaneous recordings of respiration, ΔΨm and Ca2+ uptake were performed in isolated mito￾chondria in response to Ca2+ overload, using the Oroboros Oxygraph 2K high resolution respirometry system 
coupled with a fluorescence detection unit.
Independent of respiratory substrate, additions of sub-threshold Ca2+ concentrations resulted in complete 
mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake (Green traces; Fig. 2a: insert-1, Fig. 2c,e). Prior to mPTP opening, additions of 
Ca2+induced an increase in respiration in mitochondria oxidising any of the substrates (Blue traces; Fig. 2a–
f). Importantly, upon mPTP opening (i.e. the point at which Fluo-4FF fluorescence failed to return to base￾line, (Fig. 2a: insert-2), the respiratory rate supported by NADH-linked substrates glutamate/malate decreased 
(Fig. 2a,b), while FADH2-driven mitochondrial respiration remained at an elevated plateau (Fig. 2c–f).
TMRM was used to assess changes in ΔΨm in parallel to measurement of respiration. In glutamate/malate 
energised mitochondria, transmembrane depolarisation in response to Ca2+ additions coincided with decreased 
respiration (Fig. 2b). Inhibition at cytochrome bc1 of mitochondrial complex III using antimycin A had no 
further effect on the TMRM signal, suggesting that the membrane was already completely depolarised (Red

trace; Fig. 2b). In contrast, using the FADH2-linked substrate succinate (±rotenone), ΔΨm loss occurred after a 
Ca2+-induced increase in respiration, remaining sustained at an elevated respiratory rate under these conditions 
(see above, Fig. 2c–f). Together, these data suggest that the mitochondrial respiratory response and the kinetics of 
ΔΨm loss in response to mPTP opening alter depending on metabolic substrate availability. Transient stimulation 
of respiration was followed by decreased respiration using NADH-linked substrates while, in contrast, oxidation 
of FADH2-linked substrates resulted in a large Ca2+-induced increase in mitochondrial oxygen consumption, 
sustained during mPTP opening and consistent with both an uncoupling response and a slower rate of mitochon￾drial depolarisation.
Respiratory consequences of mitochondrial Ca2+ load are primarily driven by mPTP. To inves￾tigate whether the effects of increasing mitochondrial Ca2+ load on mitochondrial respiration were triggered 
directly by Ca2+ or indirectly by mPTP opening, we used either ruthenium red (RuR) or CsA to, respectively, 
block mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake or delay mPTP opening. Mitochondria were incubated with glutamate/malate 
and subjected to a Ca2+ retention capacity assay. Consistent with published data31–33, we observed a small but 
significant decrease in State 3 respiration using both CsA and RuR (Fig. 3a). Acute incubation with CsA delayed

mPTP opening, mitochondria tolerated greater Ca2+ loads (Fig. 3b) and both the associated decline in respiration 
and collapse of ΔΨm were prevented (Fig. 3b,c). Importantly, inhibition of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake by RuR 
had the same effect on both respiration and ΔΨm (Fig. 3d,e), confirming the dependence of mPTP opening on 
mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake. Also, the Ca2+-induced increase in respiration prior to mPTP opening was com￾pletely prevented not only by blocking mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake (RuR) but also by preventing mPTP open￾ing via CypD inhibition (CsA; Fig. 3b–e). This suggested the increase in respiration was due to Ca2+-induced, 
CsA-sensitive inner membrane uncoupling which could, however, at least to the point of mPTP opening, be 
compensated for through increased respiration.
Loss of complex I-driven respiration after mPTP opening can be rescued through addition of 
exogenous NADH or succinate. Next we explored the mechanism behind the respiratory deficit after 
mPTP opening in NADH-driven respiration. Addition of exogenous succinate following mPTP opening in gluta￾mate/malate energised mitochondria caused a rapid increase in antimycin A-sensitive respiration without affect￾ing TMRM or extra-mitochondrial [Ca2+] (Fig. 4a). Addition of exogenous NADH also significantly increased 
the respiratory rate (Fig. 4b). Together, these data suggest that either feeding electrons into complex II (bypassing 
complex I) or adding saturating concentrations of NADH support respiration following mPTP opening. These 
findings confirm the respiratory deficits are a consequence of the loss of soluble, diffusible reducing equivalents 
- primarily NADH, from the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle via mPTP opening, while the provision of reducing 
equivalents at complex II, or addition of exogenous NADH are sufficient to maintain respiratory capacity.
Substrate selectively dictates rates of free radical generation both before and after mPTP 
opening. Mitochondria are an important source of cellular ROS, also implicated in sensitising mPTP for￾mation to Ca2+ 10, 34. Thus in order to dissect the relationship between metabolic substrates, ROS generation, 
respiratory chain activity, mitochondrial Ca2+ load and mPTP opening, we measured ROS generation before and 
after Ca2+ induced mPTP opening. The primary radical species generated by mitochondria is superoxide35–37. 
Although superoxide cannot cross membranes, it is rapidly converted to H2O2 by matrix-localised superoxide

dismutase (MnSOD) or spontaneously dismutates at a high rate. Additionally, H2O2 can be directly produced 
by some mitochondrial sites (i.e. flavins38). Therefore, we measured H2O2 generated by isolated mitochondria to 
assess overall rates of mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) generation.
Extra-mitochondrial Ca2+ concentration (Fluo-4FF) and H2O2 production (Amplex Red; AmpR) were meas￾ured simultaneously in a Ca2+ retention assay protocol. The rate of baseline H2O2 production by mitochondria 
energised using glutamate/malate was significantly higher than that generated by succinate alone (Fig. 5a). 
Rotenone significantly decreased succinate-driven mtROS production, suggesting that H2O2 production in the 
presence of succinate originates from superoxide generated by reverse electron transfer (RET) from complex II 
to complex I39–41. Overall, however, the contribution of RET to the total AmpR signal was low (~10%), and the 
resulting feed forward rates of mtROS flux in succinate/rotenone-driven respiration were significantly lower than 
in mitochondria energised by glutamate/malate (Fig. 5a), indicating that NADH-driven forward electron flow 
through complexes I and III are significant sources of mtROS generation. Importantly, no relationship between 
rates of mtROS production and Ca2+ sensitivity of mPTP opening was observed when supported by complex 
I-linked substrates, as higher rates of mtROS generation supported by glutamate/malate-driven respiration 
(Fig. 5a) were not associated with a higher probability of Ca2+ induced mPTP opening (see Fig. 1a). However, in 
contrast, the reduction in baseline mtROS production by the addition of rotenone under succinate-driven respi￾ration (Fig. 5a) reduced the probability of mPTP opening (see Fig. 1a). These results suggest that reverse electron 
flow through complex I contributes significantly to sensitisation of mPTP opening, while forward electron flow 
through complexes I and III does not affect the process.
In both glutamate/malate- and succinate/rotenone-energised mitochondria, mPTP opening was preceded by 
a Ca2+-induced increase in H2O2 production (Fig. 5b). This accompanied the Ca2+-dependent increased respi￾ration (forward electron flow) which was attributed to Ca2+-mediated, CsA-sensitive transient uncoupling (see 
above). In contrast, although a Ca2+-induced sustained increase in respiratory rate was supported by succinate 
(see Fig. 1c,d), this was accompanied by only a short transient increase in H2O2 production which preceded 
mPTP opening (Fig. 5b). Importantly, CsA and RuR inhibited mtROS production in a dose-dependent manner 
with glutamate/malate and succinate/rotenone as substrates, while both inhibitors increased rates of mtROS pro￾duction when mitochondria were respiring only on succinate (Fig. 5c,d,e and Supplementary Figure 2). These 
data suggest that the loss of ΔΨm due to mPTP opening has a differential impact on the forward (glutamate/
malate and succinate/rotenone) and reverse (succinate alone) electron flows. Indeed, in healthy mitochondria 
(before mPTP opening), the rate of H2O2 production following uncoupling with FCCP was: (i) dose-dependently 
reduced when mitochondria were respiring on succinate alone and; (ii) dose-dependently increased when using 
glutamate/malate as substrates (Fig. 5f), confirming the differential ΔΨm dependence of mtROS production.
To further establish the relationship between mtROS production and respiration, the rates of oxygen con￾sumption, Ca2+ uptake and H2O2 production were measured simultaneously using NADH-linked substrates. The 
Ca2+-induced transient increase in respiratory rate preceding permeability transition correlated with an increased 
AmpR fluorescence (Fig. 5g and h), and both CsA and RuR prevented the Ca2+-induced respiratory changes, 
maintaining the rates of H2O2 production at baseline levels (Fig. 5g and h).
Finally, in order to verify the sites of mtROS production by the respiratory chain, the rates of H2O2 production 
were compared across conditions following mPTP opening (i.e. after 10 sequential CaCl2 additions) and complex 
III inhibition on the FLIPRTETRA high content kinetic assay system. Antimycin A stimulated a large CsA- and 
RuR-sensitive increase in H2O2 production across all substrates (Fig. 6a–c). These responses were greater than 
those observed in control mitochondria (without Ca2+ stimulation), suggesting that rates of mtROS production 
from complex III are augmented by mPTP opening (Supplementary Figure 2). In contrast, rotenone did not 
increase H2O2 production in the presence of any tested substrate in this study (Fig. 6a–c), arguing against sig￾nificant mtROS generation by forward flow through complex I. Taken together, these data show that respiratory 
substrates, by sustaining reverse or forward electron flow, determine the consequences of Ca2+-induced changes 
in mtROS production and the relationship between ΔΨm and respiratory rate ultimately determines the rate of 
mtROS generation.

Discussion
We have investigated the effects of mitochondrial substrate availability on the probability of Ca2+-induced mPTP 
opening and its consequences. We observed different changes in mitochondrial respiration, membrane potential 
and free radical generation as a function of Ca2+ loading and mPTP opening under distinct metabolic conditions. 
In particular, the simultaneous measurements of combinations of respiratory rate, Ca2+ uptake, IMM potential 
and mtROS generation have generated new insights into the specific relationships between thee variables. Our 
key findings were: (i) the probability of mPTP opening is increased when respiration is supported by succinate 
compared to glutamate and malate, a phenomenon reduced by the presence of rotenone; (ii) the efficiency of suc￾cinate to induce mPTP opening correlates with succinate-induced RET through complex I and associated mtROS 
production, (iii) mPTP-induced depolarisation inhibits RET from succinate energised mitochondria; (iv) in the 
presence of succinate, respiration is maintained following mPTP opening and loss of mitochondrial membrane 
potential; (v) when respiration is supported by glutamate/malate, mPTP opening causes a transient increase in 
respiration followed by a decrease that can be restored by addition of NADH or succinate, consistent with res￾piratory inhibition due to the loss of matrix NADH; and (vi) although ROS are generated from complex III in the 
presence of both glutamate/malate and succinate/rotenone, this does not sensitise mPTP opening.
Previously, Huang et al. demonstrated that mPTP opening and subsequent cytochrome c release are more 
sensitive to Ca2+ when mitochondria are oxidising FADH2-linked rather than NADH-linked substrates42. We 
have added to these observations to understand metabolic consequence of Ca2+-induced mPTP opening, inves￾tigating bioenergetic changes, mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, ΔΨm and mtROS generation. We have confirmed that 
respiration supported by succinate sensitises mitochondria to Ca2+-induced mPTP opening. Inhibition of elec￾tron flux from complex I to ubiquinone (UQ) by rotenone decreased both baseline mtROS production and the 
efficiency of succinate-energised mitochondria to undergo mPTP opening. This suggests that ROS generation 
through complex I may define the sensitivity of mitochondria to Ca2+-induced mPTP opening under these con￾ditions. It is noteworthy that reperfusion following ischemia (high ΔΨm, reduced UQ), has been associated with 
succinate accumulation and increased ROS generation by RET39, 40, 43. Prevention of Ca2+-induced RET using 
rotenone reduces oxidative stress in succinate-energised mitochondria, likely being responsible for the decreased 
mitochondrial sensitivity to Ca2+-induced mPTP opening. In agreement with Chouchani et al. reverse flow of 
electrons through complex I contribute to mPTP opening43. Additionally, we have also determined that ROS pro￾duction through reverse flow is membrane potential-dependent and thus must precede mPTP opening.
We observed only a transient increase in Ca2+-induced mtROS production in succinate-energised mitochon￾dria. Since high ΔΨm is necessary to drive RET and the reduction of NAD+, the observed Ca2+-induced decrease 
in mtROS production following mPTP opening and membrane depolarisation is likely due to the cessation of 
RET41, 44–46. Consistent with these observations, addition of the ETC uncoupler, FCCP to intact/healthy mito￾chondria also dose-dependently decreased mtROS production in mitochondria energised by succinate alone. In 
succinate-energised mitochondria, the FCCP-mediated decrease in mtROS production was observed at concen￾trations consistent with membrane depolarisation and increased oxygen consumption47, responses analogous 
to mPTP opening. Additionally, inhibition of mPTP opening, using CsA and RuR, prevented the Ca2+-induced 
decrease in mtROS, suggesting that mPTP opening following Ca2+ uptake contributes to decreased oxidative 
stress in mitochondria metabolising succinate alone. mPTP-induced depolarisation therefore inhibits RET and 
mtROS generation from succinate (similar to FCCP), correlating with a transient increase in ROS in ‘succinate 
only’-energised condition and suggesting a transient peak in ROS can be efficient in pre-sensitising mPTP to 
Ca2+.
Despite Complex I-linked substrates generating higher mtROS at baseline, no increased sensitivity to Ca2+
-induced mPTP opening was observed. However, addition of rotenone under succinate-driven respiration 
reduced the probability of mPTP opening, suggesting that RET through complex I sensitises to mPTP opening, 
while forward electron flow through Complexes I and III does not affect the process. As expected, we observed 
an antimycin A-dependent increase in baseline mtROS production. Electron carriers upstream of the point of 
antimycin A-sensitive inhibition become reduced causing a large increase in baseline H2O2 production in mito￾chondria metabolising all substrates48. The antimycin A-dependent increase in H2O2 production is both greater 
after mPTP opening and sensitive to CsA and RuR, suggesting mPTP opening mediates the augmented mtROS 
production. Together, these observations suggest that complex III appears the major source of mtROS production 
following mPTP opening and, although glutamate/malate and succinate/rotenone produce ROS on complex III, 
it is not a sensitising factor for stimulating mPTP opening. ROS may have differential effects when generated at 
the inner or outer face of the mitochondrial inner membrane. Superoxide generation from complex I is directed 
towards the matrix and complex III to both the matrix and IMS, suggesting that complex I is the most significant 
source of superoxide generation towards the mitochondrial matrix49, 50. As superoxide does not cross membranes 
and is extremely reactive, it will initially react with components that are exposed in the environment next to the 
Representative oxygen flux recording using closed-chamber, high-resolution respirometry. Mitochondria (1mg 
protein ml−1
) were maintained in the presence of glutamate/malate (10mM/2mM) under constant stirring. 
Sequential additions of CaCl2 (2.5μM) were added as indicated to induce mPTP opening. Oxygen consumption 
(blue trace) and H2O2 production (AmpR; red trace) were recorded in parallel using the Oxygraph 2K equipped 
with fluorimeter and fluorescent control unit (Oroboros Instruments, Innsbruck, Austria), in the presence of 
(g) CsA (0.5μM) and (h) RuR (0.5μM; dashed traces) to inhibit mPTP opening and Ca2+ uptake respectively.

site of generation51, 52. Microdomains therefore are highly relevant for ROS species as they have a limited diffusion 
range due to their high, localised reactivity.
Under all metabolic conditions, rates of mitochondrial oxygen consumption increased following initial addi￾tions of Ca2+ preceding mPTP opening. Ca2+-induced stimulation of respiration has been proposed to occur 
through different mechanisms. Increased NADH production by Ca2+ sensitive dehydrogenases (pyruvate and 
oxoglutarate) of the TCA cycle53, Ca2+-mediated stimulation of succinate dehydrogenase54, or dissipation of the 
H+ gradient by futile Ca2+ cycling could augment electron flow through the respiratory chain55. However, under 
our conditions the Ca2+-induced respiratory increase was fully blocked both by CsA and RuR. Thus, we hypoth￾esise that low-conductance, reversible mPTP opening, may be responsible for the respiratory increase observed 
following sub-threshold Ca2+ uptake56, 57. Given the absence of effect of low concentration Ca2+ on ΔΨm, it is 
likely that these mild uncoupling events can be compensated for through increased respiration, as observed pre￾viously using FCCP at low concentration47. The lack of effect of Ca2+ on NADH provision to complex I may reflect 
that principal sites of NADH production using glutamate/malate are the Ca2+-insensitive glutamate and malate 
dehydrogenases and, additionally, that succinate dehydrogenase under these conditions has been shown to be 
inactivated by oxaloacetate58, 59.
High-conductance mPTP opening is consistent with mitochondrial inner membrane uncoupling and loss 
of ΔΨm. In contrast to succinate-energised mitochondria, where respiration is maintained following mPTP 
opening, in glutamate/malate-energised mitochondria, respiratory rates decreased following Ca2+-induced 
high-conductance mPTP opening. Soluble NAD+/NADH is lost through the mPTP to the extra-mitochondrial 
space, limiting electron flux from UQ to complex III60. mPTP opening and respiratory decline were prevented by 
CsA and RuR as soluble reducing equivalent are preserved within the matrix. Intriguingly, addition of exogenous 
NADH or succinate following complete mPTP opening and inner membrane depolarisation is able to recover and 
increase respiration. These observations are consistent with those following Ca2+ overload and mPTP opening in 
succinate-driven respiration. The flavoprotein pool, via which electrons pass from succinate, is inner membrane 
bound, therefore facilitating maintenance of respiration as succinate saturates the pool and respiratory rate hits 
maximum. In contrast to respiration driven by glutamate/malate at complex I, where soluble respiratory interme￾diate NADH is lost from the matrix. Previously, Hawkins et al. observed that supplementation by succinate could 
prevent rotenone/oligomycin- and hypoxia-induced mitochondrial depolarisation. In agreement with the data 
presented here, succinate failed to maintain ΔΨm following mPTP opening61.
In summary, we investigated the role of substrate selectivity and utilisation in determining propensity for 
Ca2+-induced mPTP opening. We have characterised key modulatory factors, including mitochondrial energetic

status and Ca2+ concentration in both regulating propensity for mPTP opening and determining consequence of 
pore opening. Together, these data further add to understanding the patho(physiological) effects of pore opening. 
For decades, mPTP opening has been recognised as a critical factor in cellular death across numerous diseases. 
Therefore, understanding the precipitating factors, the pathways culminating in pore opening and the down￾stream metabolic consequences will aid the rational design and development of therapeutics, with potential utility 
in treating multiple difficult-to-treat disease states.
Materials and Methods
Materials. All chemicals and compounds were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO), unless oth￾erwise specified. Fluorescent probes (tetramethylrhodamine methylester perchlorate; TMRM, Fluo-4FF, Amplex 
Red™; AmpR) were from Life Technologies (Eugene, OR).
Animals. Female Sprague Dawley rats (250–300 g) were from Charles River (Wilmington, MA) and allowed 
to acclimatise to conditions for four days. Animals were euthanised by cervical dislocation followed by imme￾diate removal of livers. Animal care and procedures were performed in accordance with UK Animals (Scientific 
Procedures) Act, 1986. Procedures were carried under a UK Home Office licence and studies were approved by 
Eisai’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
Isolation and storage of mitochondria. Mitochondria were isolated in accordance with published pro￾tocols62. Briefly, fresh rat livers were washed and finely minced in ice-cold wash buffer (250mM sucrose, 10mM 
KCl, 1mM EGTA, 1mM EDTA, 25mM HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.5 using NaOH). Tissue was homogenised using 
10 strokes of a glass/Teflon potter and drill, set to 1600 rpm, in 5x tissue volume of complete homogenisation 
buffer (300mM trehalose dihydrate, 25mM HEPES, 1mM EGTA, 1mM EDTA, 10mM potassium chloride, 0.1% 
essentially fatty acid free bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Sigma, A3803), cOmplete Protease Inhibitor™ (Roche 
Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany), adjusted to pH 7.5). Homogenates were centrifuged at 800 g for 10minutes 
at 4 °C, supernatants transferred to a clean tube and then centrifuged further at 10,300 g at 4 °C for 10 minutes. 
Mitochondrial pellets were surface-washed using complete homogenisation buffer and the final centrifugation 
step repeated. The pellets were re-suspended in complete homogenisation buffer and protein concentration deter￾mined by bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA) (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). Mitochondrial suspensions (50mg 
protein ml−1
) were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until use. All mitochondrial preparations 
were maintained at −80 °C for up to 7 months. Prior to activity assays, frozen mitochondria were thawed by 
briefly placing vials in a 37 °C water bath and then kept on ice until required.
Ca2+ retention capacity (CRC) assay using FLIPRTETRA. Assessment of Ca2+ retention capacity was 
used to assess in vitro sensitivity to Ca2+ of isolated mitochondrial preparations. Mitochondria were washed in 
ice-cold mitochondrial assay buffer (MAB; 75mM mannitol, 25mM sucrose, 5mM potassium phosphate mono￾basic, 20mM Tris base, 100mM potassium chloride, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, adjusted to pH 7.4) to remove 
residual EDTA and re-suspended (2 mg protein ml−1
, final assay concentration (FAC)=1 mg protein ml−1
) in 
complete MAB. To remove any contaminating Ca2+, MAB was pre-treated with Chelex 100 resin (Sigma-Aldrich, 
St. Louis, MO) and resin removed through filtration.
Complete MAB containing 2x Fluo-4FF penta-potassium salt (0.7 μM, FAC=0.35 μM) was supplemented 
with either: (1) 20 mM L-glutamic acid, monosodium salt, FAC = 10 mM; 4 mM L-malic acid sodium salt, 
FAC=2 mM, (2) 20 mM L-glutamic acid monosodium salt, FAC =10 mM; 4 mM L-malic acid sodium salt, 
FAC=2mM; 6mM NADH, FAC=3mM, (3) 20mM succinate disodium salt, FAC=10mM or (4) 20mM suc￾cinate disodium salt, FAC=10mM; 2μM rotenone, FAC=1μM). Final pH of the solutions was confirmed to be 
7.4 and adjusted where necessary using NaOH.
Mitochondrial suspensions (2x concentration; 20 μl) and supplemented Fluo-4FF containing MAB (2x con￾centration; 20 μl) were dispensed into a clear-bottom, black-walled 384 well plate containing compound using 
a Multidrop Combi Reagent Dispenser (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) and incubated for 10 mins at room 
temperature. Extra-mitochondrial fluorescence (ex. 470–495/em. 515–575) was measured at 6second intervals 
(FLIPRTETRA, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) over 35minutes at room temperature. CaCl2 (10μM final con￾centration per addition) in MAB (2.5μl additions to 40μl) was repeatedly added at 3minute intervals.
Ca2+-induced mitochondrial membrane depolarisation using FLIPRTETRA. Mitochondrial ΔΨm was 
measured using tetramethylrhodamine methylester (TMRM), a voltage-sensitive cationic lipophilic dye, parti￾tioning and accumulating in the mitochondrial matrix based upon the Nernst equation. When TMRM is loaded 
at relatively high concentrations (>100nM63), fluorescence within the mitochondria is auto-quenched. Any dis￾ruption to mitochondrial function (e.g. membrane uncoupling or electron transport inhibition) dissipates ΔΨm
with TMRM redistribution yielding an increase in fluorescence upon relief of auto-quenching.
To remove residual EDTA, mitochondria were centrifuged at 10,300 g at 4 °C for 10minutes and re-suspended 
in ice-cold complete MAB to a final concentration of 2mg protein ml−1
 (final assay concentration (FAC)=1mg 
protein ml−1
). MAB was pre-treated with Chelex 100 resin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) to remove any 
contaminating Ca2+, and resin removed through filtration. MAB containing TMRM (2 μM, final assay con￾centration=1 μM) was supplemented as for CRC assay. Mitochondrial suspension (2x concentration; 20 μl) 
and supplemented TMRM containing MAB (2x concentration; 20 μl) were dispensed into a clear-bottom, 
black-walled 384 well plate containing the compounds using a Multidrop Combi Reagent Dispenser (Thermo 
Scientific, Rockford, IL) and incubated with the compounds for 10mins at room temperature to allow TMRM 
equilibration. Fluorescence (ex. 510–545/em. 565–625) was measured at 6 second intervals (FLIPRTETRA,

Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) over 35minutes at room temperature. CaCl2 (10μM final concentration per 
addition) in MAB (2.5μl additions to 40μl) was repeatedly added at 3minute intervals.
Measurements of hydrogen peroxide generation using FLIPRTETRA. H2O2 production was deter￾mined using Amplex Red (AmpR), a dye reacting with 1:1 stoichiometry with H2O2 in a peroxidase-catalysed 
reaction to produce the highly fluorescent resorufin. Mitochondria were washed in ice-cold MAB to remove 
residual EDTA and re-suspended (2 mg protein ml−1
, final assay concentration (FAC)=1 mg protein ml−1
) in 
complete MAB. MAB was pre-treated with Chelex 100 resin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) to remove any con￾taminating Ca2+, and resin removed through filtration.
MAB containing 2x AmpR (20μM) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP; 2 U ml−1
) was supplemented as above 
for CRC assay. Mitochondrial suspension (2x concentration; 20 μl) and supplemented AmpR/HRP containing 
MAB (2x concentration; 20 μl) were dispensed into a clear-bottom, black-walled 384 well plate containing com￾pound using a Multidrop Combi Reagent Dispenser (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) and incubated with com￾pound for 10 mins at room temperature. Fluorescence (ex. 510–545/em. 565–625) was measured at 6 second 
intervals (FLIPRTETRA, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) over 35minutes at room temperature. CaCl2 (10 μM 
final concentration per addition) in MAB (2.5μl additions to 40μl) was repeatedly added at 3minute intervals.
High-resolution respirometry and parallel fluorescence measurements. Mitochondrial oxygen 
consumption was measured using the Oxygraph 2K (Oroboros Instruments, Innsbruck, Austria). Mitochondria 
were washed in ice-cold MAB, to remove residual EDTA. Mitochondria were re-suspended (1mg protein ml−1
) 
in MAB supplemented with either: (1) 10 mM L-glutamic acid, monosodium salt; 2 mM L-malic acid sodium 
salt, (2) 10 mM succinate disodium salt or (3) 10 mM succinate disodium salt; 1 μM rotenone. Mitochondrial 
suspensions were added to each chamber, maintained at 25 °C under constant stirring (250 rpm), Oxygraph 2K 
calibrated using oxygen solubility factor 0.92 and respiration allowed to stabilise.
The Oxygraph 2 K was equipped with an O2K fluorimeter and fluorescence control unit (Oroboros 
Instruments, Innsbruck, Austria) and TMRM (2μM), Fluo-4FF (1μM) and Amplex Red/HRP (10μM/1 U ml−1
) 
were added to chambers for parallel measurement of ΔΨm, extracellular Ca2+ and H2O2 respectively. A sequen￾tial titration protocol, including additions of 10 mM succinate disodium salt, 1 μM rotenone, 2.5 μM antimy￾cin A, 0.5 μM carbonyl cyanide p-[trifluoromethoxy]-phenyl-hydrazone (FCCP) and 3 mM NADH disodium 
salt, 0.5 μM CsA and 0.5 μM RuR were added, as indicated in results. Extra-mitochondrial Ca2+ fluorescence 
(fluorescence-sensor blue; LED ex. 465), ΔΨm and H2O2 (both fluorescence-sensor green; LED ex. 525) were 
measured in parallel to respiration at 3second intervals over the assay duration. CaCl2 (2.5μM final concentration 
per addition) in MAB (2μl additions to 2ml) was repeatedly added at 1.5minute intervals.
Experimental design, data analysis and statistical procedures. Data are presented as mean±stand￾ard deviation (s.d.). Normalisation of data allowed for control of inter-assay variability. AUC was calculated using 
ScreenWorks (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Curve fitting used GraphPad Prism version 7.02 for Windows 
(La Jolla, California, USA). Statistical significance tests performed are indicated in figure legends. Statistical sig￾nificance was determined as P<0.05.
