For many years investigators have been aware
of the association of hyperkalemia with acidosis
and hypokalemia with alkalosis. The early in
vitro work of Fenn and Cobb (1) suggested that
there might be a cause and effect relationship.
However, it was not until recently that satisfac￾tory in vivo data were obtained (2-7) which per￾mitted the formulation of the hypothesis that
changes in extracellular pH altered the extracel￾lular potassium concentration independently of
changes in total body potassium 3 (7). Thus, in
animals, acidosis increases and alkalosis decreases
the serum potassium concentration independently
of changes in total body potassium. The present
study demonstrates similar interrelationships in
humans.
EXPERIMENTAL PLAN AND METHODS
Five patients were selected for study because of al￾terations of extracellular pH of either metabolic or re￾spiratory origin. During the nine periods of study (five
in the same patient) an attempt was made to change ex￾tracellular pH rapidly and observe the effect of this
change on the serum potassium concentration. Extra￾cellular pH was changed by appropriate therapy which
included infusions of isotonic mixtures of NaCl, HCl,
NH4C1, NaHCO, and sodium lactate. In one patient
eight per cent CO2 inhalation was used in combination
with HCl infusion. In order to control the effect of
changes in total body potassium on the serum potassium
concentration experimental periods were short and an at￾tempt was made to change potassium balance only slightly

3 The effect of alterations of extracellular pH on the
relationship between extracellular and intracellular po￾tassium is probably related to intracellular buffering and
therefore ultimately dependent upon intracellular pH
change. However, since the latter cannot be measured, the
relationship must be studied in terms of extracellular pH.
and in the direction opposite to the anticipated change in
the serum potassium concentration. Because the caloric
needs of none of the patients had been met during the pe￾riods antecedent to the experimental period, it was pre￾sumed that glycogen stores were depleted. During the
experimental periods caloric needs were not met in order
that potassium not be deposited with glycogen.
During the period of pH change sodium, potassium,
chloride and nitrogen balances were determined in the
usual manner. All patients were parenterally fed and
none had stools during the period of study.
Femoral venous blood samples were considered to re￾flect more accurately than would arterial blood samples
the pH of the extracellular space. Whole blood pH was
determined anaerobically within ten minutes at 38° centi￾grade using a Cambridge pH meter with a glass elec￾trode. Duplicate determinations, bracketed by stand￾ards, agreed within 0.02 pH unit. Sodium and potas￾sium concentrations were determined by Baird internal
standard flame photometry. Duplicate potassium deter￾minations agreed within 0.1 mEq. per L. Chloride was
determined by a modification of the Schales' mercury
titration method (8). Plasma bicarbonate was deter￾mined by a modification of the Van Slyke titration (9).
Serum and urine non-protein nitrogen was determined
by the method of Koch and McMeekin (10).

RESULTS
The effect of extracellular pH change on the
serum potassium concentration is illustrated (Fig￾ure 1) by the course of events in patient H. M.
This patient had at the outset respiratory alkalo￾sis associated wvith hepatic comia. Extracellular
pH was altered by a combination of CO, inhala￾tion and HCI infusion. No potassiuim was ad￾ministered during the period of study and the cum￾ulative potassium balance in excess of nitrogen at
the end of four days was minus 63 mEq. The
reciprocal relationship between extracellular pH
and the serum potassium concentration is ap￾parent. Also when the pH was normal the serum

potassium concentration was normal both before
and after a loss of about 50 mEq. of potassium in
excess of nitrogen. This observation is in agree￾ment with the opinion that changes of less than
100 nmEq. in potassium balance have a small effect
per se on the serum potassium concentration ( 11 ).
The changes in serum electrolytes and electro￾lvte balances dutring the nine periods of study in
five patients are presented in Table I anid the imi￾portant changes are summarized in Table II. In
each instance a change in extracellular pH was
associated with an inverse change in serumii potas￾sium concentration: Changes in intracellular po￾tassium were small and in all but one instance op￾posite in direction to the change in seruml potas￾sium concentration. In the last column of Table
II the change in serum potassium concentration
per 0.1 tunit change in extracellular pH has been
calculated for each period of study. The range
for four periods of correction of acidosis was 0.50
miiEq. per L. to 1.20 mEq. per L. change per 0.1
pH change. The mean was 0.68 mEq. per L.
change per 0.1 pH change. For correction of alka￾losis the range was from 0.40 mEq. per L. to 1
1lmEq. per L. change pH 0.1 unit pH change. The

DISCUSSION
There are several problems inherent in attempts
to quantitate the relationship between extracellular
pH change and change in the serum potassium
concentration. First, metabolic as compared with
respiratory pH alterations may involve different
intracellular buffering mechanisms and thus be
quantitatively different. In these studies no ef￾fort was made to separate metabolic and respira￾tory disorders of extracellular pH. Second,
changes in the serum potassium concentration in￾duced by changes in total body potassium or
changes in glycogen stores introduce additional
variables. Difficulty in control of these variables
may account for the wide range of pH induced
change in the serum potassium concentration re￾ported here.
In these studies changes in intracellular potas￾sium in excess of nitrogen were in the opposite di￾rection as the change in serum potassium concen￾tration. Thus, the change in serum potassium
concentration attributed to change in extracellular
pH in most instances might be slightly greater
than that recorded.
The results demonstrate consistently that acido￾sis increases and alkalosis decreases the serum po￾tassium concentration independently of changes in
total body potassium. As discussed elsewhere
(7), the human muscle analyses of Mudge and
Vislocky (12) offer further support for the va￾lidity of this interrelationship.
Demonstration of this interrelationship between
the serum potassium concentration and extracel￾lular pH has several important clinical implica￾tions:
1) If the effect of pH is considered when in￾terpreting the serum potassium concentra￾tion as an index of potassium need, this con￾centration becomes a more accurate guide
to potassium therapy ( 11 ).
2) Extracellular pH must be controlled during
experimental evaluation of other factors con￾sidered to influence the serum potassium
concentration.
3 ) In the management of acute renal failure
correction of acidosis and production of alka￾losis will lower the serum potassium concen￾tration and may facilitate prevention of po￾tassium intoxication (cases H. P. and J. N.).
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
1. The effect of extracellular pH change on the
relationship between the serum potassium concen￾tration and intracellular potassium has been stud￾ied in 5 patients. A total of 9 experimental periods
is described.
2. The results confirm the hypothesis that aci￾dosis increases and alkalosis decreases the sertlm
potassium concentration independently of changes
in intracellular potassium. For every 0.1 unit
change in extracellular pH there was an average
inverse change of 0.6 mEq. per L. in the serum
potassium concentration.
