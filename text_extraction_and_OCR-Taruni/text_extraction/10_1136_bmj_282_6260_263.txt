PAPERS AND SHORT REPORTS
A 20-year prospective study of cirrhosis

Abstract
A total of 512 people from a defined population in west
Birmingham served by a district general hospital were
found to have cirrhosis in the period 1959-76. The annual
incidence rose from 5 6 per 100 000 to a peak of 15 3 per
100 000 in 1974. This was due to an increase in the
incidence of alcoholic cirrhosis, which in the last six
years accounted for two-thirds of cases. The proportion
of patients with decompensated cirrhosis when first seen
(65%) did not alter during the 18 years. This was reflected
in a death rate of 78% among the 468 patients traced up
to the end of 1978. Liver failure, hepatoma, and gastro￾intestinal haemorrhage accounted for almost three￾quarters of the deaths. The proportion of patients who
survived for five years was 36% for alcoholic cirrhosis,
14% for cryptogenic cirrhosis, and 60% for chronic active
hepatitis, and these figures too remained constant
throughout the 18 years. Modern methods of treatment
for decompensated cirrhosis did not improve prognosis
and only abstention in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis
had a beneficial effect on survival.
Since alcoholic cirrhosis is now the most common form
of the disease it is important to recognise those at risk
and to encourage abstinence; also, more efforts are
needed to identify the causes of cryptogenic cirrhosis.
Whatever the cause, cirrhosis needs to be diagnosed
before decompensation occurs, if treatment is to have
any effect.

Introduction
Cirrhosis of the liver is a major cause of death in many parts of
the world, and although still relatively uncommon in Britain,
there has been a steady increase in mortality over the last 25
years.1 2 We have been studying the causes and natural history
of cirrhosis in west Birmingham since 1959, and our results
represent information obtained over 18 years. Because two
previous reports have appeared3 4 we have divided our findings
into three six-year periods for purposes of comparison.
Patients and methods
From 1959 to 1976 465 adults with cirrhosis, resident in west
Birmingham, were admitted to Dudley Road Hospital, the district
general hospital. Thirty-two patients in the corresponding geriatric
and psychiatric hospitals were found to have cirrhosis, and a further
15 cases were discovered as a result of coroner's necropsies.
To ensure as complete ascertainment as possible, we asked colleagues
to notify us of any patient with cirrhosis under their care. Each year
hospital diagnostic indexes and (from 1968) computer diagnostic
print-outs prepared by the regional health authority, as well as
necropsy files kept by the pathology laboratory, were checked. All
death certificates and postmortem reports held at the Birmingham
Coroner's Court were examined. Inquiries were made of local general
practitioners who used the hospitals for patients with known cirrhosis
on their lists, but no patient who satisfied our diagnostic criteria had
been diagnosed by them without referral to hospital.
All patients were seen personally, except those who died suddenly
or in whom cirrhosis was an incidental finding at necropsy. Patients
under the age of 15 and those who lived outside the catchment area of
the hospitals were excluded, as were those previously diagnosed at
other hospitals. Efforts were made to follow all patients until death
or to 31 December 1978, when the study was terminated; 91% of
patients were finally traced. Details of alcohol consumption were
recorded at each visit, and confirmed by relatives if possible; in later
years blood alcohol concentrations and y-glutamyltransferase activity
were also measured.
To calculate the annual incidence of cirrhosis yearly figures for the
population served by the hospitals were obtained from hospital
management committee reports and the regional health authority's
Hospital Activity Analysis. The age structure of the population was
derived from census figures supplied by the City of Birmingham
statistics division.
The diagnosis of cirrhosis was based on liver biopsy appearances
in 270 patients and on postmortem findings in a further 185 (89% in
all). The remaining 57 were accepted on the basis of clinical evidence

and biochemical findings. Alcoholic cirrhosis was diagnosed if
patients admitted habitually drinking more than 80 g alcohol daily
(equivalent to five pints of beer, a bottle of wine, two-thirds of a bottle
of sherry, or a third of a bottle of spirits), if there was corroboration
from relatives, and if the histological appearances were compatible.
Post-hepatitic cirrhosis was diagnosed in 15 patients who had had a
previous attack of viral hepatitis. Other causes of cirrhosis were
confirmed by standard investigations, including immunological tests
and, in later years, tests for hepatitis-associated antigen. Patients were
labelled as having "cryptogenic cirrhosis" if no causal factor could be
found, or if no information about previous illness or drinking habits
was available.
Data were analysed using subprogrammes of the Statistical Package
for the Social Sciences.5 The x2 test, with Yates's correction where
appropriate, was used to assess statistical significance for cross￾tabulation analysis. Survival was calculated by the "survival analysis
computer programme" based on the method described by Peto et al,6
which allows survival rates to be compared by the Mantel logrank
test.

FIG 1-Annual incidence of alcoholic, cryptogenic, and other
types of cirrhosis in West Birmingham 1959-76.
BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL VOLUME 282 24 JANUARY 1981
CAUSES
Alcoholic cirrhosis was diagnosed in 242 of the district hospital
patients (52%), but the proportions in each of the three six-year
periods rose from 33-5% to 55-4% to 66-4%. Alcohol intake varied
from 80 g to 402 g daily; the mean intake in men was 152 g (mostly
as beer) and in women 112 g, more commonly as spirits or sherry.
Cryptogenic cirrhosis was the next most common category,
diagnosed in 162 (35%) patients. No history of alcohol consumption
was obtained in 66, either because the question was not asked (40) or
because cirrhosis was an incidental finding after death. The remaining
patients were either teetotal (49) or had a mean alcohol intake of less
than 80 g a day (47). Other recognised causes of cirrhosis accounted
for only 61 (12-3%) of the total. The largest group (26) had chronic
active hepatitis, while 15 patients had post-hepatitic cirrhosis and in
three others serological tests for hepatitis B surface antigen were
positive. There were only eight patients with primary biliary cirrhosis
and seven with haemochromatosis.
Of the 47 patients diagnosed outside the district hospital only 17
(36.2%) were known to be alcoholics. Twenty-eight (59.6%) were
labelled cryptogenic; little was known of their drinking habits.
AGE AND SEX DISTRIBUTION
The mean age of men with alcoholic cirrhosis was 53 years and of
women 55-2 years. Increasing numbers of patients, particularly
women, under the age of 40 were encountered in the later years of the
study, and mean age fell by eight years for women from the first to the
last six-year period but by only one year for men. The overall ratio
of men to women fell from 4:1 in the first six years to 2:1 in 1971-6
(p < 0-05).
Cryptogenic cirrhosis was most commonly diagnosed in elderly
patients: the mean age was 61-6 years for men and 68-0 years for
women. The male:female ratio was 1 1:1. These figures did not alter
significantly during the course of the study. Post-hepatitic cirrhosis
was most common in middle-aged men, seven of whom had had
hepatitis while in the Army during the 1939-45 war and died of
complicating hepatoma during the 1960s.
PRESENTING FEATURES
In 58 (11-3%) of the 512 patients cirrhosis was an incidental finding
at postmortem examination. Of those diagnosed during life about
two-thirds had signs of decompensated liver disease-ascites, jaundice
(serum bilirubin >50 ,umol/l (2-92 mg/100 ml)), encephalopathy, or
gastrointestinal haemorrhage-when first seen. Jaundice was more
common in alcoholic (36%) than in cryptogenic cirrhosis (15%) while
gastrointestinal haemorrhage was seen more frequently in the crypto￾genic group. Non-specific abdominal pain and dyspepsia were the
most common symptoms in patients with compensated cirrhosis; only
12 were referred because of hepatomegaly and none because of
abnormal liver function.
Over the 18 years little change in presenting features took place, the

were aged over 15. The annual incidence of cirrhosis increased from
5-6/100 000 in 1959 to a peak of 15-3/100 000 in 1974 and then fell
slightly. With a yearly admission rate to the district hospital of about
15 000 patients, cirrhosis accounted for about 0-3% of admissions.
The incidence ofalcoholic cirrhosis rose from an average of2-3/100 000
in the first three years of the study to reach 9-5/100 000 in the last
three years (fig 1). In contrast there was a slight fall in the incidence
of cryptogenic cirrhosis from 4-2/100 000 to 3-1/100 000, while the
combined incidence of all other types of cirrhosis remained fairly
constant at 1-2/100 000.
proportion of patients with compensated cirrhosis remaining at about
35 %. In those with alcoholic cirrhosis jaundice became more common
(p < 0.05) and gastrointestinal bleeding somewhat less so (table I).
CAUSES OF DEATH
Four hundred and one patients (78%) had died by the end of 1978,
67 were known to be alive, and 44 could not be traced. Liver failure
accounted for 126 (36.7%) deaths and hepatoma or gastrointestinal

bleeding for a further 122 (35-6) (table II). Other less common causes
included renal failure and intercurrent infections. All except nine of
the 69 hepatomas occurred in men, and half the deaths in patients with
post-hepatitic cirrhosis were due to hepatoma. The relative frequency
of hepatoma tended to decrease over the period of the study, with the
decrease in the male :female ratio. Minor differences in causes of death
were found in the different groups, death from liver failure being
more common in alcoholic cirrhosis, but there were no important
trends over the 18 years.

SURVIVAL
Mortality in the first year among patients with alcoholic, crypto￾genic, and post-hepatitic cirrhosis was high (fig 2) and five-year
survival was only 36%, 14% and 14% respectively. As expected,
patients with chronic active hepatitis, of whom 22 were treated with
corticosteroids, had a better outlook, and half those with primary
biliary cirrhosis survived five years. The death rate in patients with
decompensated liver disease was especially high (fig 3), particularly in
those with hepatic encephalopathy and variceal haemorrhage, whatever
the cause of the cirrhosis, who seldom survived five years.
No significant improvement in prognosis of any type of cirrhosis
occurred in the 18 years, and there was no sign of a better outlook for
patients with ascites, variceal bleeding, or hepatic encephalopathy.
Only complete abstention from alcohol affected survival: if this could
be achieved in patients with compensated alcoholic cirrhosis five-year
survival more than doubled, and even in patients with decompensated
disease the outlook after the first year was greatly improved (fig 4).
Discussion
The increasing incidence of cirrhosis in west Birmingham in
the last 18 years was due to a fourfold rise in the incidence of

alcoholic cirrhosis. During this time per caput intake of alcohol
in Britain nearly doubled' and nationally deaths from cirrhosis
increased by more than half.1I2At least two-thirds of patients
now attending hospital with cirrhosis are, by our definition,
alcoholic and the true figure may be higher, as we had no
information about the alcohol intake in 41% of patients with
cryptogenic cirrhosis. We chose 80 g as the lower limit for a
diagnosis of alcoholic cirrhosis, but the possibility that some
people, especially women,8 may be sensitive to smaller quantities
should be kept in mind.
Fortunately cirrhosis is still an uncommon disease in Britain,
but most patients need hospital admission for decompensated
liver disease and treatment is often heroic and expensive. During
the 18 years of our study we found no indication that cirrhosis
was being diagnosed earlier, before decompensation. The long￾term outlook for patients with complications did not improve
with advances in treatment, such as improved diuretic treatment,
more potent antibiotics, and surgical control of variceal haemor-

rhage (performed in most patients by one specialist surgeon).
Indeed, comparison with the report of Ratnoff and Patek9
showed that in patients with ascites there has been virtually no
change in mortality in the last 50 years.
There are several explanations for the poor life expectancy of
patients with cirrhosis. The proportion for whom there was any
form of "specific" treatment, such as corticosteroids, penicilla￾mine, or venesection, barely exceeded 5 %. Most patients already
had decompensated liver disease when first seen and died of
progressive liver failure or hepatoma, a tumour which has
proved particularly resistant to treatment. Fewer succumbed to
gastrointestinal haemorrhage, nearly always as a result of hepato￾renal failure rather than exsanguination. Lastly, the proportion
of patients with alcoholic cirrhosis who abstained after discharge
averaged only 19% over the 18 years.
Because alcoholic cirrhosis is emerging as the most common
form of the disease, ways must be found to detect alcoholics at
risk of developing liver damage and treatment programmes
devised which will lead to successful abstinence. The causes of
cryptogenic cirrhosis, which still accounts for a significant
proportion of patients, also need to be identified. Diagnosis
must be made before decompensation has occurred, otherwise
we shall continue to waste resources in unsuccessful treatment
of patients with irreversible liver disease.
We are grateful to our medical colleagues and records staff for
invaluable help in identifying patients; Mr P G Bevan for expert
surgical care; Dr R M Whittington, HM Coroner for Birmingham,
for permission to inspect records; and Inspector C J Clarke for help
in obtaining files.

How dangerous are falls in old people at home?
DEIDRE WILD, U S L NAYAK, B ISAACS
Abstract
From a survey in six general practices information was
obtained on 125 people aged 65 and over who fell in their
own homes. Three fractured their femurs and 15 had
other fractures; most of the rest suffered only trivial
injuries. Twenty lay on the floor for more than one
hour; none were known to have suffered hypothermia.
One-quarter of these patients died within one year of
the fall, five times as many as in an age- and sex-matched
control group; while of those who lay on the floor for
more than one hour, half died within six months of the
fall. Factors associated with mortality from falls were
impaired mobility, abnormal balance, and a disturbed
pattern of gait.
Falls at home in old age are often indicative of the
presence of severe ill health.

over at home do not break any bones.3 Some studies have been
made,4 5 but little is known about the causes of these falls,
what can be done to prevent them, what resources are devoted
to those who fall, and what happens to them.
In an attempt to find answers to these questions we organised
a survey of falls at home in people aged 65 and over in the
Birmingham area. A group of persons reporting falls were
matched for age and sex with a control group, and both were
followed for one year after the fall.
Material and methods
Six general practices in and near Birmingham kindly agreed to
take part and to notify a research nurse of all falls occurring in people
aged 65 and over that came to their attention during an observation
period of one year. Falls were defined as "untoward events which
resulted in the subject involuntarily coming to rest on the ground."
This excluded episodes of staggering against the wall or falling into
a chair or on to a bed. In a few instances consciousness was lost
and there was a suspicion of an epileptic fit; and in two cases the fall
represented the onset of a stroke. The location included the house
and its immediate surroundings, the front and back steps, the court￾yard, and the garden but excluded falls in the street. Most of the
participating doctors looked after some patients in local authority
residential homes, and any of those who fell were included in the
survey.
Information about falls was sought from the general practitioners
themselves, their receptionists, community nurses, home helps, staff
of residential homes, police, and other informants. Most falls were
reported by the practitioner himself and were accompanied by at
least a minor injury. Falls were reported at a rate of 20 falls per
