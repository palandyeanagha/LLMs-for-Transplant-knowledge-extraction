Abstract
Background: Liver represents the main organ subject to metastases from colorectal tumors. Resections of liver
metastases from colorectal cancer have a well-considered therapeutic role underlined by survival of 5 years by
approximately 50-60% of surgical cases as is deduced from an analysis of the most recent literature. The objective
of surgery is to eradicate the metastases present and obtain a margin free from neoplastic impact of amplitude of
approximately 1 cm with residual liver quantity at the end of the intervention that allows the patient to survive.
Currently the dimensions and the number of colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) do not limit the hepatectomy.
Purpose of this work is to evaluate the survival, according to our case studies of patients treated only with the
wedge resection (atypical resection) approximately 1 cm from the margins of metastases.
Methods: In “A. Rizzoli” Lacco Ameno Hospital (Ischia), from 2005 to 2010, 12 liver resections were performed for
metastases from colorectal carcinoma with atypical resection. Synchronous surgical treatment with resection of the
colorectal carcinoma and metastases was performed in 6 patients, 2 female and 4 male (Group 1). Surgical liver
metastasectomy post-colectomy was performed on 6 patients, 3 female and 3 male (Group 2).
Results: No patient was treated with chemotherapy. The mortality rate of intraoperative and perioperative
infection was in both cases of 0%. Survival:11 patients treated surgically from 2005-2010 with synchronous surgery
resection (Group 1) and liver metastasectomy (Group 2) are currently living. One 77-years-old patient died three
years after surgery for BPCO.
Conclusions: This result was able to be obtained due to the wedge resection technique routinely used in our
Hospital, associated with the indispensable use of intraoperatory ultrasound (IOUS). Significant differences between
the synchronous and non-synchronous intervention emerged only regarding the number of days of hospital stay,
higher in the first case.
Introduction
Colorectal cancer is third in incidence in the western
countries, only preceded of prostate and lung cancer in
men and breast and lung cancer in women. The combi￾nation of molecular events that lead to colorectal adeno￾carcinoma is very varied and includes genetic and
epigenetic anomalies. Were described at least two differ￾ent genetic pathways. These are the APC/beta catenine
pathway associated with WNT and the classic adenoma￾carcinoma sequence (which represents up to 80% of
sporadic colon tumors); and the pathway of the micro
satellite instability, associated with defects in the system
for repairing the DNA mismatch. There is, then, a third
group of colon tumors presenting an increase in the
methylation of the CpG island without micro satellite
instability; many of these tumors hide Kras mutations.

Many causes work together to determine the colorectal
tumor; among them were identified some associated
with lifestyle, others genetic and others of non-hereditary
type. Lifestyle and family history have long been identi￾fied as factors increasing the risk of occurrence of these
lesions: nutritional factors (diet with a large amount of
animal fats and refined sugars and low in fiber), obesity,
low physical activity, smoking and excess alcohol [1].
There are many hereditary pathologies, such as genetic
factors, that predispose onset of colorectal carcinoma,
among these the syndromes characterized by the occur￾rence of polyps (most of the colorectal carcinomas,
approximately 80%, originated from precancerous lesions
such as adenomatous polyps with dysplastic component),
familial adenomatous polyps (FAP), Polyps Associated
with MYH gene (MAP), Gardner’s syndrome, Turcot’s
syndrome; and those without polyps such as Lynch’s syn￾drome or Hereditary Non Polyposis Colorectal Carsinosis
(HNPCC)[2-4]. The probability that a polyp of the colon
may evolve toward an invasive form of cancer depends
on the dimensions of the polyp itself: is low (less than
2%) for dimensions lower than 1.5 cm; intermediate
(2% - 10%) for dimensions between 1.5 - 2.5 cm; signifi￾cant (more than 10%) for lesions of dimensions greater
than 2.5 cm.[5]. Additional risk conditions that are
included among non-hereditary factors consist of chronic
inflammatory intestinal illnesses such as Crohn’s disease
and ulcerous rectal colitis [6]. Age also is among the risk
factors; the occurrence is 10 times higher among people
between the ages of 60 and 65 compared to those from
40 to 45. Colorectal tumor is located, in half of the cases,
in the sigma and in the rectum; in one case in four (25%)
of patients, the ascending colon is affected, while the
location of the illness in the transverse and descending
colon is verified in approximately one case in five (20%).
Most frequent istotype of large intestine tumor is repre￾sented by adenocarcinoma, in 90-95% of all colon
tumors. Metastasis at the hepatic level represents one of
the most frequent forms of neoplastic progressions the
large intestine, followed by lungs, encephalon and skele￾ton [7]. It is estimated that the 25% of patients with col￾orectal carcinoma presenting liver metastases have
already been diagnosed with this. Surgical resection of
colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) is currently the only
therapeutic option able to significantly improve long￾term survival, offering possibility of potential cure. The
5-year survival rate in patients treated surgically exceeds
58%, while 10 years of survival exceeds 25% [8]. In con￾trast, patients who are not candidates for hepatectomy
present average survival lower than 12 months and at 5
years the survival rate is equal to 0.9% [9]. In this article,
we wish to emphasize the aspect of the average survival
of the patients undergoing resection of liver metastases,
presenting case studies for patients operated on in our
center between the years 2005-2010 and thus demon￾strate the major role of surgery in liver metastases from
colorectal cancer. First we must identify criteria indicat￾ing surgical resection. Our objective surgery is to eradi￾cate all liver metastases and create the conditions for at
least a centimeter of healthy tissue is left around the
lesion removed according to the “wedge resection”
approach. In reality, these limits were discussed by Cady
and Kokudo, who in their studies affirm the possibility of
holding the margins of resection in healthy tissue also at
less than 1 cm, when technically not avoidable, without
modifying survival and radicalism of the operation[10].
Current approach indicates that the resection may be
performed, as long there remains a sufficient amount of
liver that allows to patient survive during regeneration
phase [11]. It is seen, from literature, that after the resec￾tion, at least two contiguous liver segments must be pre￾sent. The remaining segments must present a branch of
portal vein, a branch of the hepatic artery, and a bile duct.
Furthermore, liver remaining must represent 20-25% of
total functioning hepatic volume [12]. This hepatic volume
is calculated based on preoperatory axial imaging and is
called a future liver remnant, FLR, and must be without
illnesses as cirrhosis, steatosis and steatopathy associated
with chemotherapy (CASH). In the past patients with
more than three metastases or with extrahepatic diseases,
were not eligible for surgery, today introduction of preo￾peratory chemotherapy and new chemotherapy drugs as
well as the progress of modern surgical technique, ampli￾fied the outcome of eligible patients. Currently size and
number of liver metastases from colorectal carcinoma
(CRLM) do not limit hepatectomy, thus making possible
the removal of all metastases present with negative mar￾gins, maintaining adequate functionality of remaining
liver. As an example we can report a case treated by us in
2009, included in group 2, of a female patient of about
60 years subject to surgical treatment to remove seven
liver metastases from colorectal carcinoma. The patient, is
in good health, is regularly subject to monitoring and has
not presented relapse. The presence of extrahepatic dis￾ease does not automatically exclude the patient from sur￾gery. Cases of long-term survival have been reported in a
significant number of patients who underwent a complete
resection of extrahepatic lesions, especially in the case of
pulmonary metastases. Decision-making in these cases is
strictly related to the experience of the medical and surgi￾cal team, the prognostic clinical factors (performance sta￾tus, synchronous and metachronous metastases, time to
appearance, serological tumour marker levels) and the
patient’s life expectancy [13]. The optimal surgical strategy
for patients with synchronous colorectal liver metastases is
not yet well-considered. Traditionally, the standard therapy
for most patients with colorectal cancer and synchronous
colorectal liver metastases consists of colorectal resection

first to prevent bleeding, perforation or obstruction,
followed 6 weeks later by staged liver resection [14]. Alter￾natively patients may be subject simultaneously to colorec￾tal and liver resection. A further therapeutic option for
patients with synchronous colorectal liver metastases
(CLM) consists of the “liver-first approach"- firstly starting
with chemotherapy, secondly doing the liver surgery and
lastly, performing the colorectal resection. The rationale of
this approach is the reflection that, in patients with
advanced or technically doubtful resectable synchronous
liver metastases from colorectal cancer, CLM might pro￾gress during treatment of the primary, precluding curative
treatment in a second stage. Since the curability of liver
metastases in this situation but not the primary tumor
decides the prognosis of the patient, resection of the
primary should be postponed. Initial chemotherapy would
control and would reduce the dimensions of liver metas￾tases and would be contextual to radiotherapy for the
primary tumor [15]. In our experience, the optimal surgical
strategy for the patients that present metastases and
primary tumors is the synchronous removal of the primi￾tive tumor and liver metastases. Patients, therefore, may
undergo simultaneous colorectal and liver resection. In
patients with inoperable liver metastases, neoadjuvant
chemotherapy may reduce their capacity, resizing them
and thus making the patient a candidate for surgical inter￾vention. According to the literature, the use of Folfox
(5-fluorouracil infusion + oxaliplatin), Folfiri (5-fluorouracil,
leucovorin, irinotecan) or Folfirinox (oxaliplatino, irinotecan,
5-fluorouracil and leucovorin) combined with biological
agents such as cetuximab (better prognosis in the cases of
mCRC with Kras wild type), may improve the rates of
response and make the 20% of patients considered ino￾perable, possible candidates for surgical treatment [16].
Standard chemotherapies have systemic toxicities and
different efficacy [17-19]. Conversely, there is no hint of a
remodeling of the Ca2+ toolkit, that has been observed in
other malignancies, including renal cellular carcinoma
[20,21], and prostate cancer[22], and has been put forward
as alternative target for selective molecular therapies [19].
In this cancer main consequences of neoadjuvant che￾motherapy, however, may be: liver toxicity, steatosis, com￾plications of the biliary tract and susceptibility to infection.
To minimize the complications, surgical intervention
should be performed approximately one month after the
end of chemotherapy.
Materials and methods
Purpose of this work is to evaluate survival, regarding
our case studies of all patients under our observation
and treated only with the surgical technique of wedge
resection (atypical resection) in order to obtain a margin
of at least 1 cm free from metastatic involvement. This
includes evaluating mortality differences and in peri- and
post-operatory complications among the patients under￾going synchronous and non-synchronous resection inter￾ventions. Liver resection is considered typical when it is
conducted on an anatomic fissure plan architecturally
distinct in the vascular structures, especially based on the
portal system. In contrast, liver resection is considered
atypical, the extension of the pathological process is
considered rather than the vascular architecture of the liver.
In “A. Rizzoli” Lacco Ameno Hospital (Ischia), from
2005 to 2010, 12 liver resections were performed for
colorectal carcinoma metastases with atypical resection.
Patients were retrospectively divided in two groups:
Group 1: six patients, two female and four male, subject
to synchronous surgical treatment with resection of the
colorectal carcinoma and metastases;
Group 2: six patients, three female and three male,
subject to surgical treatment of post-colectomy liver
metastasectomy.
An interesting fact is that none of the patients in our
study was subjected to preoperative or postoperative
chemotherapy. The average age of the patients was 60
years (range 43 - 77), with prevalence for men (7 cases
compared with 5), but this is considering the fact that
the colorectal neoplasias are most frequent in these latter.
Selection criteria for our patients were the following:
1. General operability of the patient in consideration
of concomitant diseases;
2. Adequate FLR (future liver remnant);
3. At least two remaining contiguous hepatic sectors
after the resection that present adequate blood flow
[23]. The clinical risk score (CRS) was useful to select
eligible patients and estimate an initial prognostic preo￾peratory value. It assigns one point to each of the fol￾lowing criteria:
1. Lymph nodes condition;
2. Disease-free interval from the primary to discovery
of the liver metastases of < 12 months;
3. Number of tumors > 1;
4. Preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level
> 200 ng/ml;
5. Size of the largest tumor > 5 cm.
The 5 year survival rate for patients with 0 points was
60%, whereas that for patients with 5 points
was 14%. Fong et al. concluded that patients with a CRS
of 0, 1, 2, have a highly favorable outcome and surgical
resection is undoubtedly rational therapy for such patients.
Patients with CRS of 3 or 4 have worst prognosis and they
should be preventively treated with adjuvant therapy [24].
Liver anatomy
Liver anatomy was not widely understood until the mid￾dle twentieth century. In the most anatomical text￾books, the liver appears little more than a box into which
vessels enter and leave but without any internal anatomy.

Claude Couinaud et al in France first described the seg￾mental anatomy of the liver, which is essential to modern
liver surgery. In substance the liver has 4 sectors and 8
segments. Every segment has a portal vein, hepatic artery,
and bile duct and hepatic vein branches. This means they
can all be resected separately leaving for the most part
the other segments of the liver uncompromised [25].
Even today liver segmentation is inspired by Couinaud
and divides the liver into 8 segments, each independent
regarding the arterial and venous contribution as well as
the vein flow (Figure 1). Main fissure demarcates the line
between the gallbladder and lower caval vein and the plane
of the medial-suprahepatic vein. Spigelian caudate lobe is
placed dorsally and represents segment I; Left lobe
is divided into segments II, III, IV; Right lobe in the
segments V, VI, VII, VIII. Suprahepatic veins delimit
the internal segments of the liver:Right suprahepatic veins
separates the VI and the VII segment from V and from
VIII; Medial suprahepatic veins separates the V and the
VIII segment from IV.
Preoperative assessment
Medical history conducted in patients with neoplastic
disease showed weight loss, low-grade fever and pain.
Laboratory exams showed leukopenia, increased transa￾minases, alkaline phosphatase, as well as hyperbilirubi￾nemia and hypoalbuminemia. Instrumental methods
used were the ultrasound, MRI, CT scan with cytology
and sometimes angiography. Furthermore, in all patients
was observed an increase in some tumoral markers,
including CEA, alpha-fetoprotein and TPA.
Surgical procedure
Now we illustrate the main points of the phases of surgi￾cal resection of liver metastases in a patient of 52 years,
treated in our hospital in 2006 (Group 2) (Figure 2
and 3). In 2004, Sahani et al. reported advantages of the
IOUS hepatospecific regarding the MRI with contrast
media. The sensitivity of IOUS and MRI was respectively
94.3% and 86.7% [26].
Multiple liver metastases (Group2)
Other interesting element emerged evaluating the patient
60 years already described, belonging to group 2, wich
were removed well seven liver metastases. The important
aspect is determined by the mini-invasive surgical treat￾ment of hepatic metastasis because the resection was
performed with margins from 0.5 cm to 1 cm., under strict
control intraoperative ultrasound and documented in
various phases (Figure 4). The patient is alive today and
has no metastatic relapse in routine follow-up.

Liver metastasis and colorectal carcinoma (synchronous
surgery resection) (Group1)
We illustrate the case of a patient of 67 years operated
in our hospital in 2005, belonging to group1, submitted
to surgical treatment of simultaneous resection of adeno￾carcinoma of the ascending colon and liver metastasis.
The patient is currently undergoing periodic monitoring
(Figure 5). Finally we examine the case of another patient
71 years of age treated by us in 2007, which is also
subjected to surgical treatment of synchronous resection
of adenocarcinoma of the left colon and liver metastastasi
two large 6x4 and 7x5 cm. (Group1) (Figure 6).
Results
Twelve patients affected by colorectal carcinoma and
liver metastasis were treated surgically at the Hospital in
Ischia through:
1) Synchronous surgical treatment with resection of
colorectal carcinoma and metastasis, performed in 6
patients, 2 female and 4 male (Group 1).
2) Surgical treatment of liver metastasectomy post￾colectomy performed in 6 patients, of which 3 female
and 3 male (Group 2).
Mortality
The mortality rate of intraoperative and perioperative
infection was in both cases of 0%. Postoperatory
complications
A patient treated in our hospital of liver metastasis
(Group 2), with a broncopnemopatia chronic obstructive
(BPCO) history, reported a right pleural effusion after six
days, he was quickly treated. This 77 years-old patient
died three years after intervention for BPCO. Another
female patient, 65 years of age with metastasis in the liver
segments VII and VIII infiltrating the diaphragm, pneu￾mothorax reported in the sixth day, treated with aspiration
and medication (Group 2).

Hospital stay
The average hospital stay is of 15 days after the syn￾chronous surgical treatment of colorectal carcinoma and
liver metastasis (Group 1), while the average stay is 9
days after the liver metastasis (Group 2) (Figure 7).
Survival
Eleven patients treated surgically from 2005-2010 with
synchronous surgery resection (Group 1) and liver
metastasectomy (Group 2) are currently living. One 77-
years-old patient died three years after surgery for
BPCO.
Monitoring hemostasis
In no case was it necessary to perform transfusions on
the surgically-treated patients.
Conclusion
Cancer and other chronic disease have an increased
incidence in old age induced by oxidative stress
mechanisms [27,28]. Oxidant overproduction occurs in
response to several stressors like drugs, chemicals,
hypercaloric diet and physical exercise [29]. Colorectal
cancer is third in incidence in the western countries and
median age of occurrence is in the sixth and seventh
decades. Surgery for colorectal liver metastasis is now
well established, it has produced very significant benefits
for patients. According to our experience, it is useful to
surgically treat all patients with liver metastasis remova￾bles and you need to resect as much as possible metastases
as long as you manage to get a free margin of at least 1 cm
without neoplastic disease. Outcome was obtained in 11
patients treated with the exception of female patient, 60
years of Group 2, who had seven liver metastasis removed,
leaving, however, a free margin from the lesion equal to
0.5 cm of free tissue. This result was able to be obtained,
in our opinion, due to the wedge resection technique rou￾tinely used in our center, associated with the indispensable
use of intraoperatory ultrasound (IOUS). The confirma￾tion of the resectionability of the secondary effects on the
liver and the safety of the surgical strategy to adopt,
including the delimitation of the resection margin, only
takes place on the operating table after bimanual palpation
and intraoperatory ultrasound. This may in fact indicate
foci of the disease smaller than 3 mm not shown in the
investigations, evaluate the anatomic relationship between
the tumor and the vascular peduncle and guide the exci￾sion of lesions. The occurrence of operatory mortality and
infection was equal to 0% for both groups. No significant
difference emerged in mortality between patients subject

to synchronous and non-synchronous resection; The times
of stay regarding synchronous intervention were higher
compared with metastasectomy. Since 2011 we have surgi￾cally treated other cases that we do not include in our
work for brief follow-up.
