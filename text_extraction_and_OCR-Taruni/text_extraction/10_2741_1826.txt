1. ABSTRACT
Hepatolithiasis is prevalent in East Asia,
including Japan, but occurs much less frequently in
Western countries. Hepatolithiasis appears mostly as brown
pigment stones (calcium bilirubinate stones). The disease is
characterized by its intractable nature and frequent
recurrence, requiring multiple endoscopic or operative
interventions, in distinct contrast to gallbladder cholesterol
or black pigment stones. In view of the lack of information
on the pathogenesis, a multidisciplinary approach has been
carried out through the Hepatolithiasis Research Group
organized by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare of
Japan. In this review, the up-to-date data on the molecular
pathogenesis of hepatolithiasis with special reference to a
defect in phospholipid metabolism are introduced and
discussed. Furthermore, a potential medical treatment
targeting hepatic phospholipid transporters is proposed as a
future therapeutic option for the disease.
2. PATHOGENESIS OF HEPATOLITHIASIS
Gallstones in hepatolithiasis consist of two
groups; i.e., brown pigment stones (calcium bilirubinate
stones) and cholesterol stones—the former predominating
(1-3). It should be stressed that intrahepatic brown pigment
stones contain less bilirubin and bile acid and more
cholesterol than those either in the common bile duct or in
the gallbladder (2,4,5). The presence of brown pigment
with a wider range of cholesterol contents as well as
cholesterol stones among hepatolithiasis suggests that the
complex nature of the pathogenesis should be considered; e.g.,
not only the formation and precipitation of calcium bilirubinate
but also the solubility of cholesterol in hepatic bile.
In searching for any metabolic defects underlying
the formation of cholesterol-rich brown pigment stones, a
recent study has suggested hepatic transport and secretion
defects of phospholipids (phosphatidylcholines) in the liver
of patients with hepatolithiasis (6). This review discusses
the role of hepatic transport and secretion defects of
phospholipids in the pathogenesis of the disease.
2.1. Role of phospholipids in bile
Phosphatidylcholine (PC), the major class of biliary
phospholipids, cholesterol, and bile acids form mixed micelles
in bile (Figure 1). This protects the biliary epithelium from
detergent action of hydrophobic bile acids (7), which are
present at high concentrations in the biliary tree (8,9).
The PC translocating activity of ATP binding
cassette protein B4 (Abcb4) formerly known as the multidrug￾resistance 2 P-glycoprotein (mdr2), murine homologue of
human ABCB4 (MDR3), in the canalicular membranes of
hepatocytes is considered the rate-limiting step in biliary
phospholipid secretion in vivo (10-12). Evidence in support of
Abcb4 as a PC translocator has been provided using
membranes of yeast secretory vesicles (13,14).
In mice, the phospholipid-deficiency due to
homozygous disruption of Abcb4 results in liver injury
associated with chronic nonsuppurative destructive
cholangitis (15), as well as spontaneous cholesterol
cholecysto- and hepatolithiasis (16). Decreased or even
absent expression of ABCB4 has been observed in several
clinical forms of cholestasis, such as progressive familial
intrahepatic cholestasis type 3 (PFIC-3) (17), intrahepatic
cholestasis during pregnancy (18), primary hepatolithiasis
(intrahepatic bile duct stones) (6,19) and low phospholipid
associated cholelithiasis (20) (Figure 1). These genetic
abnormalities provide an important link between defective
canalicular transport of phospholipids and the development
of hepatocholangiopathies and indicate that ABCB4 may
be a target for novel therapeutic strategies.
2.2. Abnormal lipid composition in hepatic bile of
patients with hepatolithiasis
Phospholipid concentrations were significantly
decreased in the bile specimens from both the stone￾containing hepatic ducts and the unaffected ducts for
patients with intrahepatic brown pigment stones, and in the
specimens from both the affected ducts and the unaffected
ducts for patients with intrahepatic cholesterol stones,
compared to the specimens from hepatic ducts of control

Figure 1. Role of phospholipids in bile. (A) Under normal conditions, phosphatidylcholine (PC) in bile protects cholangiocytes
from bile acid toxicity by forming mixed micelles. Also, proper proportions of bile acids to PC in bile are necessary to maintain
solubility of cholesterol. (B) ABCB4 deficiency, e.g. progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 3 (PFIC3), results in
decreased biliary PC level and high bile acid to PC ratio and causes bile duct injury (cholangitis and ductular proliferation). (C)
ABCB4 deficiency results in decreased biliary PC level and high cholesterol to PC ratio, leading to a high biliary cholesterol
saturation index (CSI). This will promote lithogenicity of bile with crystallization of cholesterol, which could favor small bile
duct obstruction (Adapted with permission from the reference (21)).
subjects and patients with gallbladder cholesterol stones
(Table 1) (6).
Cholesterol/phospholipid (Ch/PL) ratios in bile
were significantly higher in patients with intrahepatic
calculi, in both affected and unaffected sides, than in
control subjects and patients with gallbladder cholesterol
stones. In contrast, phospholipid/bile acid (PL/BA) ratios in
bile were significantly lower in patients with intrahepatic
brown pigment stones, in both affected and unaffected
sides, than in control subjects and patients with gallbladder
cholesterol stones. Cholesterol saturation indices were
significantly higher in patients with intrahepatic calculi, for
the specimens from both affected and unaffected ducts,
than in control subjects and patients with gallbladder
cholesterol stones.
Under these conditions of the decreased
formation of mixed micelles in the bile, the presence of
hydrophobic bile acids in the bile ducts could solubilize the
plasma membrane of the biliary epithelia. Hyposecretion of
phospholipids, coupled with hydrophobic bile acid (e.g.,
chenodeoxycholate) secretion, may thus contribute to
intracterable and long-standing cholangitis in patients with
hepatolithiasis (termed chronic proliferative cholangitis)
(22,23).
2.3. ABCB4 expression in livers of patients with
hepatolithiasis
Phospholipid concentrations are significantly
decreased in the hepatic bile issuing from both affected and
unaffected bile ducts of hepatolithiasis patients in this
study, irrespective of stone category (6). This is supported
by the decrease in both affected and unaffected hepatic
segments of mRNA and protein levels of ABCB4 (Figures
2 and 3), which is rate-limiting for phospholipid secretion
into bile (10-12).
To elucidate whether the decreased ABCB4
mRNA and protein expression in hepatolithiasis patients is
associated with the gene mutations, a mutation analysis on
the cDNA of the ABCB4 gene with special reference to the
coding region was performed using the liver specimens of
hepatolithiasis patients (24).
By sequence analysis of the gene (Figure 4), a
77-bp deletion at nucleotides 537–613 in exon 7 in
transmembrane domain (TMD) 3, which results in a
frameshift at codon 179 and an early stop codon predicting
a truncated protein, was found as a heterozygous mutation
in 2 of the 16 patients. A 1-bp deletion at nucleotide 1015
in exon 10 in TMD 6 was found as a heterozygous
mutation in one of those 2 patients, and a 242-bp deletion at
nucleotides 2683–2924 in exons 22–23 in TMD 11 was
found as a heterozygous mutation in the same patient. No
other mutations were found in the other 14 patients. In real￾time PCR, no significant difference was found between the
mRNA levels of ABCB4 in the 2 HL patients with mutations
nor in the other 14 patients without mutations (Figure 4).
The immunostaining of ABCB4 outlined the
canalicular membrane domain but was less defined and
focally absent in the liver of patients with hepatolithiasis,
especially in affected segments (6). In the hepatolithiasis
we studied here, histology of biopsied liver specimens
showed minor changes associated with cholestasis in the

GAPDH.

affected segments but almost no changes in the unaffected
segments. It can therefore be assumed that decreased
expression of ABCB4 is primary rather than secondary to
stone-associated biliary obstruction.
It is quite important to determine whether the amount
of canalicular ABCB4 protein is altered in hepatolithiasis
patients with the ABCB4 gene mutations. Immunostaining
of ABCB4 protein was found in the bile canaliculi of liver
sections from the two patients with mutations (Figure 4).
The results suggest that in primary hepatolithiasis the
decreased transcription levels of ABCB4 in the liver are not
due to the mutations detected in the coding region of the
gene, and that either unknown mutations in the promotor
region of the ABCB4 gene or a possible involvement of
unknown genes possibly regulating ABCB4 transcription
and/or trafficking in the liver.
In hepatolithiasis, the observed biochemical/metabolic
defects in the liver may be interpreted as the consequence
of primary events, since these changes are specific to
patients with hepatolithiasis and observed in both affected
and unaffected segments of the liver, irrespective of
whether the stones are brown pigment or cholesterol.
However, specified factors initiating the defects in the liver,
e.g., food and environmental issues stated before, or even
gene mutations, have not been well elucidated yet.
2.4. Intracellular transporter expressions in livers of
patients with hepatolithiasis
The intracellular transporters SCP2, PCTP, and
HBAB for cholesterol, phospholipid, and bile acid,
respectively, in the liver were determined by RT-PCR
(Figure 5) (6). Levels of PCTP mRNA were significantly
decreased, in both hepatic segments affected by stones and
unaffected segments of patients with intrahepatic brown
pigment stones, and in both affected segments and unaffected
segments of patients with intrahepatic pure cholesterol stones,
irrespective of stone category, compared to the levels of
control subjects, gallbladder stone patients, and patients with
obstructive cholestasis. However, levels of SCP2 and HBAB
mRNAs in the liver of intrahepatic stone patients, in both
affected and unaffected segments, were not significantly
different from the levels of control subjects, gallbladder stone
patients, and patients with obstructive cholestasis.
3. Potential therapies for hepatolithiasis
Our studies (6,24) and studies from other groups
(19,20) suggest that the decreased hepatic transport and
biliary secretion of phospholipids is involved in the
etiological process of hepatolithiasis. Therefore, future

Immunostaining of ABCB4 shows a diffuse and linear pattern outlining the canalicular membrane domain of the liver section
from a control subject (A: original magnification x 100). However, in sections of the livers from a hepatolithiasis patient with
ABCB4 gene mutations (B: original magnification x 100) and a hepatolithiasis patient without mutations (C: original
magnification x 100), the staining pattern of ABCB4 outlines the canalicular membrane domain but is less defined and focally
absent. No significant difference was found between hepatic localization of ABCB4 in the hepatolithiasis patients with and those
without ABCB4 gene mutations.
medical treatments with some drugs and agents which
target the molecules important for the pathogenesis of the
disease should be proposed.
Fibrates are antihyperlipidemic drugs, which up￾regulate the expression of Abcb4 through gene
transcription and promote biliary phospholipid secretion
(25). Biliary PC secretion is limited by the amount of
ABCB4 present in the canalicular membrane of the
hepatocytes (11,17,26,27). Clinically, treatment with
bezafibrate (BF) improves the elevated serum levels of biliary
enzymes in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (28,29), a
chronic cholestatic liver disease characterized by progressive
inflammatory destruction of the intrahepatic bile ducts. The
beneficial therapeutic effects of BF in patients with primary
biliary cirrhosis suggest the possibility that the drug promotes
the PC translocating function of ABCB4 through increasing
the protein amount in the bile canaliculi and improves the bile
duct injury through protecting the cholangiocytes from
hydrophobic bile acid toxicity by forming mixed micelles with
the increased biliary PC.
Importantly, the expression and function of Abcb4 is
regulated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor
alpha (PPARalpha) in mice (30) and BF, acting as a ligand
for PPARalpha (31), up-regulates the transcriptional level
of PPARalpha (31). When we explored whether BF￾induced changes in ABCB4 expression and function are
mediated by PPARalpha, BF may enhance the capacity of
human hepatocytes to transport PC into bile canaliculi by
promoting insertion of ABCB4 molecules into the
canalicular membrane via PPARalpha-mediated mechanism
(Figure 6) (32). These observations provide a rationale for the
use of BF to restore canalicular ABCB4 expression and

a novel mechanism through the stimulation of exocytosis and insertion of ABCB4 into the bile canaliculi. By treatment with BF,
the vesicular targeting of ABCB4 into the bile canaliculi may be enhanced through the PPARalpha-mediated mechanism. These
provide a rational for the beneficial role of BF in stimulation and restoration of defective ABCB4 expression and function in
various types of cholestatic hepatobiliary diseases.

diseases, including hepatolithiasis.
In therapeutic aspects for hepatolithiasis,
adjuvant treatment with BF after surgical or endoscopic
stone removals, which target the ABCB4 gene product,
should be introduced in future clinical practice, especially
for the intractable cases.
