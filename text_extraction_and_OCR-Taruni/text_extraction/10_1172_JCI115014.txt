Abstract
Nitric oxide (an endothelium-derived relaxing factor) induces
smooth muscle relaxation and is an important mediator in the
regulation of vascular tone. Advanced glycosylation end prod￾ucts, the glucose-derived moieties that form noncnzymatically
and accumulate on long-lived tissue proteins, have been impli￾cated in many of the complications of diabetes and normal ag￾ing. We demonstrate that advanced glycosylation products
quench nitric oxide activity in vitro and in vivo. Acceleration of
the advanced glycosylation process in vivo results in a time-de￾pendent impairment in endothelium-dependent relaxation. Inhi￾bition of advanced glycosylation with aminoguanidine prevents
nitric oxide quenching, and ameliorates the vasodilatory im￾pairment. These results implicate advanced glycosylation prod￾ucts as important modulators of nitric oxide activity and endo￾thelium-dependent relaxation. (J. Clin. Invest. 1991. 87:432-

Introduction
An important mediator of smooth muscle responsiveness and
resting vascular tone is endothelium-derived relaxing factor
(1). Produced by endothelial cells in response to diverse hu￾moral stimuli, this factor traverses the subendothelial space
and activates smooth muscle cell guanylate cyclase. Intracellu￾lar cyclic guanosine monophosphate levels increase, leading to
smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilatation. The active con￾stituent of endothelium-derived relaxing factor recently has
been identified to be the free radical species nitric oxide (NO)'
(2, 3).
Interposed in the anatomic pathway ofnitric oxide action is
a layer of subendothelial collagen that separates the intimal
endothelial cells from the smooth muscle cells of the media.
Recent studies have demonstrated that vascular collagen accu￾mulates in situ, through covalent, posttranslational modifica￾tion, the products of advanced glycosylation (Fig. 1) (4, 5).

acid; NO, nitric oxide.
These products represent the terminal adducts ofthe nonenzy￾matic glycation reaction between glucose and the amino
groups of protein (6, 7). Because matrix collagen turns over
very slowly, advanced glycosylation end products accumulate
with age, and form at an accelerated rate when plasma glucose
is elevated (as in diabetes mellitus) (5, 8, 9).
Examination ofthe structures ofmodel advanced glycosyla￾tion products (10-12) and ofthose compounds that have been
isolated directly from tissue ( 13) led us to consider the possibil￾ity that these protein-bound moieties might react with and
quench nitric oxide. Such an interaction would prevent endo￾thelial cell-derived nitric oxide from activating smooth muscle
relaxation. Interest in this possibility was motivated by obser￾vations that defective endothelium-dependent relaxation is a
prominent feature in situations where high levels of advanced
glycosylation end products occur, such as in diabetes (14-16)
and in aging (17, 18).
In this study, we demonstrate that advanced glycosylation
products inactivate nitric oxide via a rapid chemical reaction.
The participation of advanced glycosylation products in nitric
oxide quenching in vivo was examined in a rat model ofexperi￾mentally induced diabetes. Chronic hyperglycemia accelerates
the advanced glycosylation reaction and the deposition of ad￾vanced glycosylation end products (5, 8, 9). Diabetic rats dis￾played a time-dependent impairment in vasodilatory responses
to nitric oxide generating agents that was not reversed by insu￾lin administration. The selective pharmacological inhibition of
advanced glycosylation slowed the development ofthe vasodi￾latory impairment. These studies indicate that advanced glyco￾sylation products are important modulators of endothelium￾dependent relaxation, and that nitric oxide quenching is likely
to play an important role in the evolution of vasodilatory de￾fects in vivo.
Methods
Preparation ofadvancedglycosylation endproducts. Lysine-derived ad￾vanced glycosylation products were prepared by incubating 1 M glu￾cose-6-phosphate with 50 mM L-lysine in 0.2 M sodium phosphate
buffer, pH 7.4, for 10 d. All incubations were performed sterilely, an￾aerobically, in the dark, and at 370C. Final products were observed to
have an A35o of 0.68 mM-' lysine equivalent. Albumin-derived ad￾vanced glycosylation products were prepared by incubating 50 mg/ml
human serum albumin (type V; Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO)
with 0.5 M glucose-6-phosphate or 1 M glucose in 0.1 M sodium phos￾phate buffer (pH 7.45) for 8 wk at 37°C. Unreacted carbohydrate was
removed before assay by extensive dialysis against PBS. Final derivi￾tized products yielded an A350 of45.9 mM-' albumin. Collagen type IV
(human placental; Sigma Chemical Co.) was incubated with glucose as
above except that the final protein concentration was 5 mg/ml. For the
time course studies (Fig. 6), test solutions were assayed without further
dilution.
Albumin-derived advanced glycosylation products were reduced
with sodium borohydride (NaBH4) by adding a 200-fold molar excess

of borohydride to albumin (19). The mixture was incubated at room
temperature for 10 min, on ice for 50 min, and then dialyzed exten￾sively. Aminoguanidine hydrochloride (Aldrich Chemical Co., Mil￾waukee, WI) was added at the initiation of the advanced glycosylation
reactions. I -Deoxy- I -morpholino-D-fructose was obtained from Sigma
and I -deoxy- I -propylamino-D-fructose was prepared from a-D-glucose
and n-propylamine following the method of Michel and Hagemann
(20). The model advanced glycosylation product 4-furanyl-2-furoyl￾1H-imidazole-1-hexanoic acid (FFI-HA) was synthesized from an
aqueous mixture of furylglyoxal and 6-aminohexanoic acid and puri￾fied by medium pressure chromatography on silica gel as described
previously (21). Glucose-derived I -alkyl-2-formyl-3,4-diglycosyl￾pyrrole (AFGP) was prepared by incubating glucose with 6-aminohex￾anoic acid and sodium sulfite for 26 dat 370C followed by chromatogra￾phy on Dowex AG I x 4 anion exchange resin and FPLC (I 1). Struc￾tures and purity of synthesized compounds were confirmed by proton
nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (10, 11).
Nitric oxide assay. Nitric oxide activity was measured chemically
following the modifications (2) of a procedure described by Bell et al.
(22). This method relies on the diazotization of sulfanilic acid by nitric
oxide at acid pH and subsequent coupling to N- I -naphthyl)-ethylene￾diamine. Colored product at an OD of 540 nm forms quantitatively in
the presence of nitric oxide or compounds that spontaneously release
nitric oxide. For these studies, a saturated solution ( 1-2 mM) ofauthen￾tic nitric oxide solution was prepared by bubbling nitric oxide gas
(Matheson Gas Products, Inc., Bridgeport, NJ) for 2 min into ice-cold,
deoxygenated H20 under anaerobic conditions in sealed, gas-tight vials
(2). Although the diazotization reaction is specific for nitric oxide
(NO), nitrite (NOj), an oxidation product of nitric oxide is detected at
a many-fold lower sensitivity (2, 22). This was confirmed in our study
by observing a marked diminution in absorbance after aeration of the
nitric oxide standard solution. Nitric oxide quenching was determined
by incubating anaerobically an aliquot (50 ,d) of nitric oxide solution
(yielding a final concentration of 5 ,uM) with the test solution (0.2 ml)
for 5 min. At the end of this time, 0.1 ml of a solution of 3.75 M HCI
and 18.75 M sulfanilic acid was added, followed by the addition of0.05
ml of 12.5 M ethylenediamine. Absorbance values were recorded after
an additional 10 min ofincubation at room temperature. The addition
ofglycosylation products to the test assay in any other sequence did not
affect the measurement of nitric oxide, indicating that the quenching
effect of these compounds was due to reaction with nitric oxide, and
not the result of interference in the assay for nitric oxide. Quenching
values were calculated after subtraction of reagent blanks (without ni￾tric oxide addition) and represent duplicate measurements of at least
two experiments.
Animalstudies. Male Lewis rats (Charles River Breeding Laborato￾ries, Inc., Wilmington, MA) aged 10 wk were used in these studies
which were conducted in accordance with The Rockefeller University
Laboratory Animal Research Center guidelines. After a I -wk adapta￾tion period, diabetes was induced in rats by rapid intravenous injection
of streptozotocin (65 mg/kg) (Sigma Chemical Co.) and confirmed by
measurement of serum glucose at 2 wk (480±42 mg%) and at 4 wk.
Urinary ketones were measured with Ketostix (Miles Ames Div., Miles
Laboratories, Inc., Elkhart, IN).
For blood pressure studies, rats were anesthetized with 50 mg/kg
i.p. Nembutal and the common carotid artery surgically exposed and
cannulated with polyethylene tubing (PE 50). Blood pressure, heart
rate, and respiratory rate were monitored continuously with a pressure
transducer and a model 7702B recorder (Hewlett-Packard Co., Palo
Alto, CA). Dose-response curves for acetylcholine and nitroglycerin
were generated by injecting drugs through a three-way stopcock di￾rectly into the ascending aorta. Drugs were diluted in sterile H20 to
produce a constant injectable volume of I ml kg-' animal weight. The
hypotensive response was measured at 1 min postinjection and the
percent change in mean arterial pressure calculated. Increasing doses of
drugs were then injected in each animal after at least a 4 t1/2 washout
from the prior injection. Baseline blood pressure and heart rate were
not observed to vary significantly among the different experimental
groups. Duplicate measurements for each drug dose were obtained for
each experimental animal. Animals were not reused poststudy. In addi￾tion, one group of diabetic animals (n = 4, duration of diabetes 2 mo)
was administered subcutaneous insulin for 96 h (2 U NPH insulin/100
mg body weight bidaily).
The aminoguanidine-treated, diabetic group was administered 250
mg/kg aminoguanidine hydrochloride (dissolved in sterile H20) by sin￾gle daily oral dose, beginning 7 d before the induction ofdiabetes. Both
treated and untreated diabetic groups manifested similar levels of hy￾perglycemia (diabetic group: 480±42 mg%, aminoguanidine treated
group: 468±43 mg%). In separate experiments, control (nondiabetic)
rats (n = 4) also were administered aminoguanidine and studied for
blood pressure responses.
Results
Advancedglycosylation products inactivate nitric oxide in vitro.
We initially observed the quenching of nitric oxide by ad￾vanced glycosylation products in the following experimental
system. Model advanced glycosylation products were prepared
by incubating lysine with glucose-6-phosphate for 10 d at 37°C.
Glucose-6-phosphate was chosen as a model sugar because its
rate ofanomerization favors the open-chain form. This acceler￾ates the initial condensation reaction between the sugar and
primary amino groups (23). High concentrations of sugar also
accelerate advanced- glycosylation. These incubation condi￾tions yield fluorescent, glucose-derived lysine adducts that pos￾sess the physicochemical and spectral properties of advanced
glycosylation products that are bound to protein in vivo (24).
As shown in Fig. 2 (top) the addition of increasing amounts of
lysine-derived advanced glycosylation products to nitric oxide
results in a first-order inactivation curve for nitric oxide. A
control experiment in which lysine and glucose-6-phosphate
were allowed to incubate alone, followed by mixing and incu￾bation with nitric oxide, did not yield products with quenching
activity. Time course studies showed that the quenching reac￾tion occurred rapidly (< 5 s to completion, data not shown).
Advanced glycosylation products that are bound to protein
also quench nitric oxide. Fig. 1 (bottom) shows the nitric oxide￾quenching effect of human serum albumin that had been incu￾bated with glucose-6-phosphate and then dialyzed to remove
unbound products. Similar first-order quenching kinetics were
observed. Unmodified albumin (incubated under the same
conditions, but without sugar) showed no measurable quench￾ing activity.

Advanced glycosylation products prepared by the incuba￾tion ofsugars with either lysine or albumin consist ofa mixture
of products that represent many intermediates in the advanced
glycosylation pathway (7, 25). To acquire some information
about the structural requirements of quenching activity, lysine
and albumin-derived advanced glycosylation products were
subjected to chemical modification and reassayed for quench￾ing activity (Fig. 3). Reduction with sodium borohydride did
not affect nitric oxide quenching, suggesting that the quench￾ing species was not an early glycosyl adduct, such as a Schiff
base, or the Amadori product (7, 25). It is significant that the
addition of aminoguanidine (400 mM) to the albumin/glu￾cose-6-phosphate incubation inhibited the formation of the
quenching species. Aminoguanidine is a hydrazine-like com￾pound that inhibits the progression of advanced glycosylation
both in vitro and in vivo (26, 27).

activity. The compound FFI-HA (10, 21) did not quench nitric
oxide within the concentration range tested. AFGP is believed
to represent an intermediate in the advanced glycosylation
pathway because it was isolated under conditions in which the
terminal steps of advanced glycosylation were inhibited (1 1).

quenching product formation did not precisely parallel the for￾mation of the characteristic absorbance changes of advanced
glycosylation. Quenching activity formed rapidly during days
2-6, whereas advanced glycosylation was linear during this pe￾riod. It appears that the quenching product forms after the
Amadori product, but still relatively early in the advanced gly￾cosylation pathway. Although quenching activity may result
from the interaction of nitric oxide with AFGP or a related
product, a radical-mediated inactivation reaction may also oc￾cur. Electron spin resonance studies have shown that free radi￾cal species form during the early phase of advanced glycosyla￾tion (28). Fig. 5 also demonstrates that the inhibitory effect of
aminoguanidine is concentration dependent, i.e., addition of
increasing amounts ofaminoguanidine inhibits both advanced
glycosylation and quenching product formation to an increas￾ing degree.
The time-dependent modification of human serum albu￾min and collagen by glucose also led to the time-dependent
formation ofa nitric oxide-quenching species (Fig. 6). Amino￾guanidine inhibited both advanced glycosylation and nitric ox￾ide quenching. The increased rate of advanced glycosylation

Advanced glycosylation products inhibit nitric oxide-me￾diated vasodilatation. Wereasoned that the advanced glycosyla￾tion products that form in vivo might alter the vascular re￾sponse to pharmacological agents that act via a nitric oxide
intermediate. To examine this possibility, we studied the blood
pressure responses of experimental rats to the vasodilating
agents acetylcholine and nitroglycerin. Acetylcholine is an en￾dothelium-dependent agent that stimulates the endothelial cell
to produce nitric oxide via a receptor-mediated mechanism
(29), whereas nitroglycerin is an endothelium-independent
agent that generates nitric oxide directly and nonenzymatically
(30). Since long-term hyperglycemia accelerates protein glyca￾tion and the subsequent accumulation of advanced glycosyla￾tion products on matrix and vascular wall collagen (5, 8, 9),
one group of animals was subjected to chronic hyperglycemia
by inducing the diabetic state with streptozotocin. At various
time intervals after the induction ofdiabetes, intraarterial can￾nulas were inserted and the vasodilatory response to increasing
doses of acetylcholine and nitroglycerin measured. The hy￾perglycemic animals were found to have an impaired endothe￾lium-dependent (acetylcholine) relaxation response that in￾creased with the duration of hyperglycemia (Fig. 7, top). Peak
impairment occurred at 2 mo, and equaled the degree of im￾pairment that was observed in animals made diabetic 1 yr
previously. A similar time-dependent impairment in vasodila￾tation was observed with the endothelium-independent agent
nitroglycerin (Fig. 7, bottom). The observation that impaired
vasodilatation occurred in response to both endothelial cell￾derived nitric oxide and to chemically generated nitric oxide
suggested that the vasodilatory defect in these animals must be
a postendothelial cell phenomenon.
To assess the contribution of hyperglycemic physiology to
vascular dilatation, one group of animals (n = 4, duration of
diabetes 2 mo) was administered subcutaneous insulin for 4 d
and then studied for impaired vasodilatation. As expected,
within 72 h these animals were found to have blood glucose in
the 120-180 mg% range and to have had a reversal in ketogene￾sis (assessed by the absence of urinary ketones). Dose-response
curves for acetylcholine and nitroglycerin demonstrated only a
minor improvement in the vasodilatory response; with the
dose-response curve for the insulin treated group falling be￾tween the 2 mo and the 1-mo diabetes duration group (data not
shown).
Taken together, these observations suggest that the im￾paired vasodilatatory response in experimental diabetes is the
result of a long-term, postendothelial cell effect. This is consis￾tent with the excessive accumulation ofadvanced glycosylation
products within the subendothelial collagen. To address di￾rectly the role of advanced glycosylation in nitric oxide
quenching, one group of hyperglycemic rats was administered
the advanced glycosylation inhibitor, aminoguanidine.
Previous studies in experimentally induced diabetes have dem￾onstrated that aminoguanidine significantly prevents the accu￾mulation ofadvanced glycosylation end products both in vascu￾lar wall collagen and in long-lived basement membrane pro￾teins (26, 27). A control study of vasodilatation in normal rats
(n = 4) revealed that aminoguanidine administration does not
affect baseline vascular responses when these animals were

compared with an age-matched, untreated group (data not
shown). Fig. 8 illustrates that when administered to diabetic
rats, aminoguanidine had a significant sparing effect in the pro￾gression ofthe vasodilatory impairment. This effect was appar￾ent at 1 mo and became more pronounced after 2 mo of dia￾betes. The observation that the protective effect of aminogua￾nidine occurred in the case of both endothelium-dependent
(acetylcholine) and endothelium-independent (nitroglycerin)
agents is consistent with nitric oxide quenching at the subendo￾thelial level. In an additional study, rats were administered
aminoguanidine after diabetes had been established for 1 mo
(when defective vasodilatation appears [Fig. 7]). In this case,
after 2 mo of treatment with aminoguanidine, the vasodilatory
responses of these animals (n = 4) did not differ significantly
from the untreated diabetic group. This result further suggests
that the action of aminoguanidine is to prevent the formation
of glycosylation products that can quench nitric oxide. Once
quenching intermediates form, i.e., after 1 mo of experimen￾tally induced diabetes, aminoguanidine is ineffective in ame￾liorating the vasodilatory defect that occurs as a result of
chronic hyperglycemia.

Discussion
The identification ofnitric oxide as a mediator ofendothelium￾dependent relaxation has opened new avenues of investigation
into both normal and abnormal vascular physiology (29). De￾fective endothelium-dependent relaxation characterizes many
pathophysiological states, including diabetes (14-16), aging
(17, 18), atherosclerosis (31, 32), and some forms of hyperten￾sion (33, 34). This study demonstrates that nitric oxide activity
is modulated in part by acquired protein modifications that
occur within the vascular wall. Advanced glycosylation is a
posttranslational modification process that results in the for￾mation of glucose-derived heterocycles with diverse chemical
structures (6, 7, 25). This process occurs ubiquitously on extra￾cellular matrix proteins and advanced glycosylation products
accumulate progressively with age. This study demonstrates
that relatively early in the advanced glycosylation pathway,
reactive intermediate(s) form that can react with and quench
nitric oxide. Quenching occurs rapidly (< 5 s) and appears to
result from a direct reaction between the nitric oxide radical
and the advanced glycosylation product(s). Time course and
borohydride reduction studies indicate that the quenching
product occurs after Amadori product formation. In vitro, for￾mation of the quenching product plateaus while the character￾istic absorbance and fluorescence changes ofadvanced glycosyl￾ation continue at a rapid rate. Presumably, as reactive, oxidiz￾ing moieties form within advanced glycosylation products,
they become available for reaction with nitric oxide. It is signifi￾cant that the time course of quenching product formation is
similar to that which has been observed for the formation of
free radicals during the advanced glycosylation reaction (28).
Thus, a direct free radical reaction may also contribute to nitric
oxide inactivation. Of two synthetic advanced glycosylation
products that were tested for quenching activity, the com￾pound AFGP, which represents an advanced glycosylation in￾termediate, was found to quench nitric oxide in vitro. Whether

in vivo quenching activity is due to AFGP alone, or to other
advanced glycosylation intermediates, must await further in￾vestigation.
Experimental rats with chronic hyperglycemia and acceler￾ated advanced glycosylation end product deposition demon￾strate a slow, time-dependent decrease in nitric oxide respon￾siveness. This vasodilatory impairment was not corrected by
insulin administration and normalization ofmetabolic parame￾ters such as blood glucose and ketones. The observation that
defective vasodilatation occurred in response to both endothe￾lium-dependent and endothelium-independent agents is con￾sistent with nitric oxide inactivation by advanced glycosylation
products within the subendothelial space. The role ofadvanced
glycosylation in nitric oxide inactivation in vivo was confirmed
by administering the advanced glycosylation inhibitor amino￾guanidine to diabetic animals. In these animals a significant
amelioration in the vasodilatory impairment was observed.
The impairment in the vasodilatory response was found to
plateau at 2 mo, and equaled the magnitude ofthe defect pres￾ent after I yr of diabetes (Fig. 7). The time course of vasodila￾tory impairment is consistent with the formation of post-Ama￾dori glycosylation products that form over a period of several
weeks in experimental diabetes (26). Structural studies ofcolla￾gen modification have demonstrated that in both normal and
diabetic individuals, advanced glycosylation end products con￾tinue to accumulate over many years (5, 8, 9). Thus the
"plateauing" of vasodilatory impairment may be due to addi￾tional factors that limit the progression of the vasodilatory de￾fect. Other hemodynamic controls, such as prostaglandin (35),
catecholamine (36), or electrolyte (37) mediated pathways may
supervene and prevent further impairment in vasodilatation.
An alternative explanation for the plateauing effect would be
that formation of the nitric oxide quenching moiety becomes
saturated after 2 mo ofhyperglycemia. This is supported by the
in vitro quenching data (Fig. 5) that indicate that the formation
of the quenching intermediate plateaus while advanced glyco￾sylation continues at a rapid rate. In vivo this situation would
be analogous to the accumulation of the fructosyl-lysine Ama￾dori product on long-lived structural proteins. Tissue measure￾ments, in agreement with calculated equilibrium constraints,
have demonstrated that Amadori product formation always
plateaus at a level that is 3-3.5-fold higher than normal, irre￾spective of the absolute duration of hyperglycemia (38, 39).
Defective endothelium-dependent relaxation is a feature of
both experimental and human diabetes (14-16). The results of
recent animal (40, 41) and human studies (42) indicate that
nitric oxide is produced tonically by endothelial cells, implicat￾ing it as an important mediator ofnormal resting vascular tone.
The time-dependent inactivation of nitric oxide by advanced
glycosylation end products may represent an important mecha￾nism in the evolution ofdiabetes and age-related hypertension.
The existence ofanimal models for accelerated advanced glyco￾sylation, as well as specific pharmacological inhibitors of both
advanced glycosylation and nitric oxide production, will facili￾tate the future study of this process.
Recent studies have expanded the role of nitric oxide from
endothelium-dependent relaxation to that of an intercellular
messenger between neurons (43), hepatic cells (44), and within
the kidney mesangium (45). Advanced glycosylation products
form ubiquitously on extracellular matrix proteins and have
been implicated in many ofthe physicochemical abnormalities
that characterize diabetic and aged proteins (9, 46). including
increases in cross-linking and decreases in chemical and pro￾teolytic digestibility. This study indicates that advanced glyco￾sylation products also play a role in the modulation of cellular
communication, suggesting that nitric oxide quenching may
contribute to the hyperglycemic and age-associated changes
that occur on the multicellular and organismal level.
