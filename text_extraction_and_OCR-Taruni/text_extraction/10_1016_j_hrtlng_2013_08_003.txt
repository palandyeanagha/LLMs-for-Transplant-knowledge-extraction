Abstract
Background
Psychosocial factors and physical health are associated with increased psychological 
distress post-heart transplant. Integrating findings from qualitative studies could
highlight mechanisms for how these factors contribute to psychological well-being, 
thus aiding the development of interventions. 
Objective
To integrate qualitative findings regarding adult heart transplant recipients 
experiences, such as their emotions, perceptions and attitudes. 
Methods
A systematic review and meta-summary were conducted. Data from seven studies
were categorized into 16 abstracted findings.
Results
The most prominent finding across the studies related to recipients’ perceptions of 
the importance of social support. Other prominent findings related to factors that 
promoted psychological well-being, such as faith, optimism and sense of control.
Conclusions
Psychological well-being may be improved by enhancing perceived control over 
health and daily life, promoting an optimistic outlook by facilitating access to social
support from other heart transplant recipients and ensuring post-transplant recipient￾caregiver partnerships adequately support the transition back to independence.

Introduction
Heart transplant (HT) is associated with greater long-term survival than alternative
end-stage heart failure treatments, including ventricular assist devices and the total 
artificial heart.
1, 2 On average, HT also yields dramatic improvements in functional 
status and overall quality of life.
3 However, psychological disorders and high levels of 
psychological distress are common after transplant.
4-7 In a comprehensive review of
post-transplant psychological outcomes, investigators concluded that depressive
disorders, anxiety-related disorders and associated distress were the most common.4
Yet, there is a paucity of evidence regarding the effectiveness of interventions
designed to improve psychological outcomes for HT recipients.8 This lack of 
evidence led the Psychosocial Outcomes Workgroup of the Nursing and Social 
Sciences Council of the International Society for Heart and Lund Transplantation to
recommend that trials of interventions to maximize psychosocial outcomes must be 
conducted.9 Of note, they also recommended that “novel interventions could be 
designed based directly on the existing psychosocial outcomes literature in 
cardiothoracic recipients” (p.721).9
Reviews of HT outcomes literature have already been conducted.4, 9 Both 
psychosocial factors as well as physical health were found to be associated with 
increased psychological distress. Psychosocial factors included hope, reliance on 
passive coping strategies, lack of social support and low sense of control.
4 Physical 
health status indicators of increased risk for psychological distress include poor 
functional status, medication side effects, physical symptom frequency, comorbidities 
and sleep abnormalities.4
Numerous qualitative studies have investigated how recipients perceive their 
transplant experiences. The qualitative nature of these studies facilitated in-depth 

5
exploration of recipients’ perceptions of the factors that contributed to their past and 
present emotions.
10 Recipients were also presented with the opportunity to elaborate 
on their perceptions of what and how particular aspects of the transplant impacted on 
their sense of well-being.
11, 12 Qualitative studies have also explored how recipients’
coped with the many challenges associated with transplantation, including 
management of the side effects of the post-transplant treatment regimen.
13 Data 
regarding the experiences of HT recipients from these qualitative studies are rich in 
detail. For this reason, they have the potential to inform the complexity of poor 
psychological outcomes after HT in far more depth than has previously been 
available in quantitative studies and reviews.14 However, to the authors’ knowledge, 
the findings from these qualitative studies have not been considered in any previous 
review of post-HT psychological outcomes.4, 9
Integrating findings from the numerous qualitative studies that have been published 
might help to highlight potential mechanisms for how the complex interplay of 
physical health and psychosocial factors, such as emotions, coping ability and social 
support, ultimately contributes to psychological distress and the development of 
psychological disorders. Thus, the aim was to integrate published qualitative 
research findings regarding the experiences of adult HT recipients. We defined 
qualitative findings, which included yet were not limited to emotions, perceptions and 
attitudes, as ‘experiences’. The knowledge derived from an integration of the 
findings from qualitative studies could ultimately aid practice by informing the 
development of novel interventions focused on improving post-transplant 
psychological outcomes.

6
Methods
A systematic review and meta-summary of qualitative findings guided by the
methods described by Sandelowski and Barroso were conducted.15 A meta-summary 
is the integration of qualitative findings based on quantitative logic, in that the
frequency of findings is used as the indicator of validity.
16
Meta-summary is one particular approach of many that can be used to integrate 
qualitative findings from more than one research study. It can be performed either in 
isolation or as preliminary work that is conducted prior to performing a meta￾synthesis. Meta-summary is most often performed in isolation when the qualitative 
findings to be included in the research integration study are judged by the reviewers 
to be in the form of what Sandelowski and Barroso described as, ‘summaries’ of 
qualitative data as opposed to interpretive syntheses.
17 Sandelowski and Barroso 
posited that only qualitative findings of synthesized data should be subjected to 
meta-synthesis.18 As such, in circumstances in which the majority of findings are 
judged to be ‘summaries’ of qualitative data instead of ‘syntheses’, the meta￾summary method is appropriate.
18
Literature search
Studies were identified by searching the Medline, CINAHL, EMBASE and PsycINFO
databases from 1995-end 2012. Keywords relevant to the population (heart 
transplant recipients) and the type of study (qualitative) were used. The search 
strategy used for the MEDLINE database is presented in a Supplementary File. 
Reference lists of potentially relevant studies and the forward citation search capacity 
of Google Scholar were also used to identify potentially relevant articles.

7
Study Selection
Titles and abstracts were screened to identify primary research studies, which 
presented qualitative findings related to the experiences of HT recipients. This review 
did not focus on a particular post-transplant time period because studies have 
identified that psychological distress is present both early and long-term post￾transplant.
19, 20 This review included studies that focused on the experiences of
adults, rather than paediatric and adolescent HT recipients because of differences in 
the aetiology of heart failure between these two distinct subsets of the population.
21
Furthermore, paediatric and adolescent HT recipients have unique experiences, such 
as struggling with independence from parents.22 Studies that examined the 
perspectives of caregivers or families of adult HT recipients were excluded. 
Research designs that involved techniques for data collection, analysis and 
interpretation that are commonly viewed as qualitative research methods, such as 
open-ended interview questions, face-to-face or focus group interviews and thematic 
or content analysis, were included. Studies that involved a mix of quantitative and 
qualitative methods were also included. Only studies published in full text after 1995
were considered eligible for inclusion in this review. This decision was based on the 
fact that there had been considerable improvement in outcomes as well as changes 
in treatment for HT recipients in recent years, mostly related to the advances in 
immunosuppression regimens. 4, 7, 23 Only studies published in English were 
considered for inclusion. However, in order to determine the extent to which this 
constraint might impact the results, we did not limit the search strategy to return only 
articles published in the English language. The full text version of all articles 
identified as being potentially relevant to the inclusion criteria outlined above was 
retrieved and read by two reviewers for a final determination of study inclusion. 

8
Difference of opinion regarding study inclusion between the two reviewers was 
resolved through discussion and consultation with a content expert if required.
Data extraction
A standardized form was used to evaluate and extract data related to 14 different 
aspects of each study judged to have met the inclusion criteria, such as the research 
problem, methods, findings and discussion.
24 This form was developed specifically 
for reports of qualitative studies included in research integration studies.
24
Statements of findings, which were relevant to the experiences of HT recipients,
were extracted into one section of the reading form. A finding was defined as a 
statement, which was intended by the authors of the study to represent a recurring 
event or element across either an entire sample or specified portion of the sample.15
Where studies used mixed methods we extracted only the qualitative findings. No 
studies were excluded based on poor quality, as research has shown that appraisal 
of qualitative studies is highly idiosyncratic.
15, 25 As such, the omission of findings 
from a qualitative research integration study based on a reviewer’s judgement of
inadequate reporting or methodological mistakes could lead to the exclusion of 
findings with important implications for practice.18 Instead, similar to previously 
conducted meta-summaries, and also in accordance with guidance from 
Sandelowski and Barroso’s typology of what does and does not constitute a finding 
in qualitative research, only selected findings from included studies for which there 
was no evidence of how a set of qualitative data was transformed into a finding were 
excluded.
17
Integration of findings
Three important general characteristics of the studies included in the review were 
identified during the data extraction process. First, it was evident that a number of 

9
different qualitative methods, such as grounded theory and phenomenology, had 
been used. Second, some studies did not state that a particular qualitative method 
was used. Instead, the authors described that data were analysed using ‘content 
analysis’. Third, many studies reported summaries of qualitative data organized into 
general topics or ‘themes’ as opposed to interpretive syntheses.17 For these reasons, 
and in accordance with the guidance for qualitative research integration from 
Sandelowski and Barroso, we decided that the integration of findings from these 
studies would be more suited to an aggregative rather than interpretive approach.18
As such, we did not proceed to perform meta-synthesis. 
In this regard, a list of abstracted findings, which was intended to accurately capture 
the content and meaning of all the extracted findings as well as to eliminate 
redundancies, was produced.
15 This was achieved by reading and re-reading the list 
of extracted findings until each statement was listed beneath a corresponding 
abstracted finding. The completed list was checked by a second reviewer to ensure 
extracted findings were categorized into a representative abstracted finding. 
Difference of opinion regarding abstraction of findings between the two reviewers 
was resolved through discussion. Frequency effect sizes were then calculated in 
order to quantify the strength of the abstracted findings, thus ensuring the importance 
of these findings was not under or over-emphasized.
15 The frequency effect size of 
each abstracted finding was calculated by dividing the number of studies with a 
selected abstracted finding by the total number of studies from which findings were 
extracted to be included in the meta-summary.15
Results
Results of the search strategy are presented in Figure 1. From 17 potentially relevant 
studies, eight were judged to have met the inclusion criteria. Table 1 presents a 

10
summary of these studies. Two of the studies reported analyses undertaken using 
the same dataset.12, 13 The research designs differed considerably across all the 
studies. One study reported using mixed methods,11 two studies reported that 
grounded theory was used,12, 26 two studies reported using phenomenology10, 27 and 
three reported using exploratory or interpretive descriptive research designs.13, 28, 29
Sample sizes ranged from three to 42. In total, there were 154 HT recipients included 
in our review. Apart from one study that enrolled exclusively female participants,
11 in 
all other included studies, more men than women participated. The setting of the 
studies varied, with three studies each conducted in North America and the UK, while 
one study was conducted in Brazil and a further study in Taiwan. All studies involved 
face-to-face interviews.
Of note, due to the fact that it was reported that a ‘qualitative design’ and ‘in-depth 
interviews’ were used, the study by Lin et al.28 met the inclusion criteria set for this 
review. However, the report of findings in this study was not supported with data from 
the participants. Instead, the findings presented were a list of the frequency with 
which various topics were reported by the participants in the interviews that were 
conducted. For this reason, this study’s findings were judged to be consistent with 
what Sandelowski and Barroso described in their typology as a ‘topical survey’, 
which is not defined by these authors as qualitative research.17 As such, no findings 
were extracted from this study to be included in our meta-summary.17
A total of 131 findings regarding the psychological impact of HT were extracted from 
the qualitative studies included in this review. These extracted findings were 
summarized into 16 abstracted findings, which are presented according to their effect 
size in Table 2. 

11
A complex array of experiences were identified across the qualitative studies 
included in this review. Some of the experiences (effect size 57%) were positive, 
such as having a sense of gratitude and pride.11, 27 In addition, HT recipients 
experienced a strong sense of altruism post-transplant.10, 11, 27 Others were negative
experiences (effect size 57%), though, such as feeling fearful, being depressed, 
experiencing a sense of guilt and even feeling the need to grieve.
10-13, 26 Even though 
they were not known to the recipient, a sense of grief was expressed for the loss of 
the donor’s life as well as for the recipient’s own heart that had needed to be 
transplanted.10, 12
The most prominent finding across the studies related to the support that was 
received by the HT recipients (effect size 71%). Having adequate support from a 
variety of sources, including family, friends, previous HT recipients and the transplant 
healthcare team, was considered to be essential throughout the HT experience. 
However, too much support from family members at a time when the HT recipient 
was trying to readjust back to normal life was noted as an impedance to recovery 
and even a source of potential conflict within family dynamics.
26 Receiving support 
from others who had previously undergone HT was considered particularly beneficial 
as HT was viewed by recipients as a unique experience (effect size 29%).10, 29
Other prominent findings related to factors that recipients considered helpful to their 
recovery and psychological well-being. One such factor was having faith. This finding 
was quite common across the studies (effect size 57%).
10, 11, 13, 27 Accepting that life 
post-transplant involves continued challenges, such as the threat of rejection, was 
another common finding (effect size 29%).11, 13 Being optimistic was another method 
by which HT recipients dealt with the challenges associated with life after transplant
(effect size 57%).
11, 13, 26, 27 For example, recipients compared themselves with 
someone whom they considered to be in situations that were worse than their own.13

12
Using active coping strategies was identified as a way to aid recovery (effect size 
14%).
27
Perceived control over health and daily living was noted to be an important driver of 
HT recipients’ psychological well-being (effect size 29%).11, 26 However, many 
experiences influenced HT recipients’ ability to maintain control. Examples include 
sudden deteriorations in health that required hospitalisation, which required 
recipients to cede control to others (i.e. caregivers and healthcare providers).
26 
Heart transplantation also gives recipients a sense of hope for their future (effect size 
29%). As such, recipients are able to set new goals and priorities for their life post￾transplant (effect size 57%). They set about regaining a sense of normality in their 
lives (effect size 43%) and gaining independence to care for their own health (effect 
size 43%). 
Findings regarding the phenomenon of denial post-HT, both as a psychological 
experience that could be beneficial12 and detrimental13, were reported in the studies
(effect size 43%). Denial was used by HT recipients as a strategy to deal with 
negative emotions about the donor.12 Others were in denial about the challenges that 
they would necessarily face in the future, as evidenced by the avoidance of
interactions with other HT recipients.13
Discussion
The most prominent finding across the studies indicated that social support is 
important for recipients’ psychological well-being.
10, 13, 29 Moreover, it seems that the 
importance of social support during recovery from HT may not be culturally-specific, 
as the studies were conducted across a variety of regions including the US, Canada, 
Brazil and the UK. This finding is consistent with results of many quantitative studies.
Self-perceived family support predicted quality of life in a study of 150 HT recipients 

13
in Taiwan.30 Dew et al., found that HT recipients with lower social supports are at 
increased cumulative risk for psychological disorders.31 Evidence also indicates 
social support is an important contributor to long-term post-transplant health. At both 
five and 10 years after HT, satisfaction with social support predicted HRQOL (r2 = 
0.59, P < .0001; r2 = 0.66, P < .0001 respectively).32 Our meta-summary extends 
these quantitative findings by providing insight into the role of healthcare provider
and family caregiver support as perceived by transplant recipients. Findings
highlighted the importance of support transitioning to an appropriate level that 
permits the recipient to gradually take back responsibility for their care. Such an 
approach may promote recipients’ sense of independence and instill a strong sense 
of perceived control over health and daily life. Further research is required to 
explicate how best to promote a post-transplant recipient-caregiver partnership to 
healthcare decision-making that is different from the pre-transplant caregiver￾recipient relationship and supports the transplant recipient’s transition back to 
independence. 
On a related note, findings indicate that HT recipients experience the sense of losing 
control over their health and daily lives during periods of sudden deterioration in 
health that require hospitalisation, which was detrimental for their psychological well￾being.
11 This finding is also consistent with other research, which found that
perceived control was associated with emotional adjustment after HT.
33 A further 
study reported a statistically significant (p<.05) positive correlation between personal 
control and well-being (r=0.52).34 Therefore, during hospitalisations for investigation 
and treatment of, for example, acute allograft rejection or infection, healthcare 
providers should consider it a priority to provide the HT recipient with as many 
opportunities to care for themselves as possible. Other interventions, which have 
been shown to increase perceived control in cardiac populations, include reframing 

14
techniques in which an acute event is view not as something that is uncontrollable, 
but as an isolated exacerbation of a chronic condition that can be controlled with 
adherence to prescribed medications and lifestyle modifications.
35 Interventions to 
improve perceived control have not been tested specifically in the HT population.
Thus, this is an area of research that should be considered for investigations in the 
future.
The uniqueness of the HT experience was another prominent finding across the 
qualitative studies. We also identified that HT recipients experience a strong sense of 
altruism post-transplant. Together, these findings suggest that peer-support 
programs for HT recipients may be a “win-win” strategy. They would give new 
recipients access to others who share their unique experience, and they would 
provide experienced recipients a means to act on their sense of altruism.11, 27
Because evidence of the impact of support group interventions on psychological 
outcomes for HT recipients is equivocal, further study is needed.
9, 36 One mechanism 
by which support group interventions may promote post-transplant psychological 
well-being is by helping their peers to maintain an optimistic outlook. Findings from 
qualitative studies indicated that being optimistic aids coping with their illness and 
recovery (effect size 57%).11, 13, 26, 27 A quantitative study has reported similar 
positive associations between optimism and psychological well-being. At three 
months post-transplant, positive expectations were significantly associated with good 
mood (r=-0.64; p<0.05), and quality of life (r=0.66; p<0.01).
37
The finding that HT recipients’ engagement in their faith was important to the 
maintenance of their psychological well-being and overall health was noted in several 
studies.
10, 11, 13, 27 Evidence from a small quantitative study corroborates these 
findings. It was found that heart transplant recipients with strong beliefs who 
participated in religious activities had better physical and emotional well-being, fewer 

15
health worries and greater medical compliance.38 Translation of this finding into
clinical practice will require further inquiry, but merits consideration because of its 
prevalence across qualitative studies.
Deficiencies in the literature and corresponding implications for research
In this review, we have identified that only one qualitative study’s specific aim was to 
investigate post-transplant psychological problems. However, this study recruited a 
convenience sample of participants as opposed to purposefully selecting participants 
who had displayed objective evidence of psychological problems or disorders.12
While the stated aim in the mixed methods study by Evangelista et al.11 was to 
explore the experiences of HT recipients as opposed to psychological problems 
specifically, it was reported that the mean value for psychological distress among the 
33 female HT recipients was in the moderate to high category. Findings from the 
group of participants who did exhibit high levels of distress could not be separated 
out though. Therefore, no qualitative studies have investigated the experiences of HT 
recipients who have been diagnosed with psychological disorders. This is an area 
that will require further research, as increased understanding of how the symptoms
emerge and evolve over time in HT recipients who meet the criteria for diagnosable 
psychological disorder could help to inform the development of targeted interventions
for prevention and treatment.
17
Also of note, quantitative studies have reported gender differences in risk for 
psychological distress. Female gender was identified as a factor that increased 
cumulative risk for psychiatric disorder post-transplant.39 A recently identified 
potentially contributing factor for this increased risk is that women perceived worse 
distress associated with post-transplant physical symptoms than men.40 Interestingly 
though, substantial differences in post-transplant experiences between genders were 

16
not reported in the qualitative studies included in this review. This could be due to the
fact that most studies included a majority of male participants. Yet, effect sizes 
presented in Table 2 clearly demonstrate that all the abstracted findings present in
the study which enrolled a sample that consisted entirely of women were also 
present in at least one other study included in the review (Table 2).11 Further 
qualitative research specifically investigating gender differences would be beneficial, 
as this review of existent qualitative findings was unable to identify any gender￾specific issues that might explain differences in post-transplant psychological 
outcomes between male and female HT recipients. 
As noted throughout the discussion above, when the findings from the qualitative 
studies are considered within the context of previous evidence derived from patient 
outcome studies, there is support for the conduct of research into the effectiveness of 
numerous interventions to improve psychological outcomes. These include
interventions which improve perceived control, support group interventions and 
caregiver-focused interventions to promote a post-transplant recipient-caregiver 
partnership that supports the transition back to independence.
Limitations
A limitation to be noted is that only studies published in English language were 
included. However, only one potentially relevant study published in another language 
was uncovered in our search of the literature. A further limitation was that only 
published literature was included in our review. Also, while the study reported by 
Sadala et al.10 met the inclusion criteria, because it did not focus specifically on 
paediatric or adolescent HT, it should be noted that 4 of the 26 HT recipients were 
less than 18 years of age at the time of transplant. However, none of the findings 
presented by the authors were noted to be exclusive to these recipients.10 Therefore, 

17
it is unlikely that including this study in the review impacted on the conclusions drawn 
about adult HT recipients. 
Conclusion
This review is the first integration of qualitative findings regarding the experiences of 
adult HT recipients. Prominent findings were that: HT gives rise to a complex set of 
both positive and negative experiences and HT recipients perceive that social 
support, having faith, being optimistic and maintaining a sense of control over one’s 
health and daily life promotes psychological well-being. Interestingly, findings related 
to sense of control and social supports are consistent with results of quantitative 
studies. Yet, the qualitative findings increased understanding of these phenomena by 
providing insight into the particular circumstances in which HT recipients experience 
the sense of losing control and the specific sources of social support they perceive to 
be the most important. As such, these findings could ultimately aid practice by 
informing the development of novel interventions focused on improving post￾transplant psychological outcomes. Specific recommendations for such
investigations were outlined. Other post-transplant experiences deemed by recipients 
to promote psychological well-being were identified that had not been articulated in 
the previous reviews of quantitative studies. In response to these findings, we 
presented recommendations for further inquiry.
