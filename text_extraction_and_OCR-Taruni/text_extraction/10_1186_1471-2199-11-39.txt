Abstract
Background: Given the epidemic proportions of obesity worldwide and the concurrent prevalence of metabolic 
syndrome, there is an urgent need for better understanding the underlying mechanisms of metabolic syndrome, in 
particular, the gene expression differences which may participate in obesity, insulin resistance and the associated series 
of chronic liver conditions. Real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) is the standard method for studying changes in relative gene 
expression in different tissues and experimental conditions. However, variations in amount of starting material, 
enzymatic efficiency and presence of inhibitors can lead to quantification errors. Hence the need for accurate data 
normalization is vital. Among several known strategies for data normalization, the use of reference genes as an internal 
control is the most common approach. Recent studies have shown that both obesity and presence of insulin resistance 
influence an expression of commonly used reference genes in omental fat. In this study we validated candidate 
reference genes suitable for qRT-PCR profiling experiments using visceral adipose samples from obese and lean 
individuals.
Results: Cross-validation of expression stability of eight selected reference genes using three popular algorithms, 
GeNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper found ACTB and RPII as most stable reference genes.
Conclusions: We recommend ACTB and RPII as stable reference genes most suitable for gene expression studies of 
human visceral adipose tissue. The use of these genes as a reference pair may further enhance the robustness of qRT￾PCR in this model system.
Background
The increasing prevalence of obesity worldwide has
drawn research on adipose tissue into the spotlight. Adi￾pose tissue is a complex and highly active tissue with
important metabolic and endocrine functions. It not only
plays a central role in energy balance but also functions as
an endocrine organ secreting various adipokines and
cytokines [1,2]. On the basis of its distribution, adipose
tissue is divided into three main regions: subcutaneous,
intramuscular and visceral fat [3,1].
Accumulation of excessive visceral fat (visceral obesity)
is associated with an array of metabolic perturbations
including type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, non-alco￾holic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), non-alcoholic steato￾hepatitis (NASH), cardiovascular disease, hypertension
and hyperlipidemia together referred to as "metabolic
syndrome" [4,5]. However, the role of visceral obesity in
metabolic syndrome is yet to be fully elucidated [6]. Fur￾thermore, a causal relationship between insulin resis￾tance and metabolic syndrome has not been shown
conclusively; Obesity seemingly causes insulin resistance,
on the other hand insulin resistance appears to aggravate
and propagate the adverse effects of obesity [7]. This
somewhat co-dependent and circular relationship is diffi￾cult to untangle and has generated a multitude of clinical
and research publications.
Another area of disagreement involves NAFLD, a com￾mon condition affecting about 70% of obese and over￾weight individuals and increasingly being recognized as a

major cause of liver-related morbidity and mortality [8].
The pathological picture of NAFLD encompasses a spec￾trum of liver injury ranging from simple hepatic steatosis
to more severe manifestations, including NASH, which
can progress to fibrosis, cirrhosis, and liver failure [9,10].
Studies have reported frequent association of metabolic
syndrome and diabetes in patients with NASH, which can
progress to NAFLD [9,11,12]. It has even been suggested
that hepatic steatosis itself may be the primary cause of
insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome in obesity
[13]. However, it is still unclear whether NAFLD is a
cause or a consequence of insulin resistance [14] and if
metabolic syndrome precedes NAFLD or is a result of
NAFLD [8]. Many NAFLD centered studies involve the
profiling of adipose samples for the production of various
soluble mediators of inflammation produced by compo￾nents of the visceral fat and released in circulation.
Real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) is the standard method for
studying changes in relative gene expression in different
tissues and experimental conditions. The popularity of
this technique is attributed to its high sensitivity and
specificity [15]. However, variations in amount of starting
material, enzymatic efficiency and presence of inhibitors
can lead to quantification errors. Hence the need for
accurate data normalization is vital [16]. Among several
known strategies for data normalization [17], the use of
reference genes as an internal control is the most com￾mon approach [15].
An ideal reference gene is one which is consistently
expressed at the same level in all samples under investiga￾tion regardless of tissue type, disease state, medication or
experimental conditions, and exhibits expression levels
comparable to that of the target gene [18]. 18S, β-Actin
(ACTB), Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH), Beta-2-microglobulin (B2M), RNA poly￾merase II (RPII or POLR2A), Tyrosine-3 monooxygenase/
Tryptophan-5 monooxygenase activation protein, zeta
polypeptide (YWHAZ), Ubiquitin C (UBC) and Hypox￾anthine phosphoribosyl transferase 1 (HPRT1) are some
of the most commonly used reference genes in RT-PCR
studies [2,19,15]. However, numerous studies have shown
that expression of these common reference genes vary
with tissue type as well as physiological state [20,19]. This
variation can potentially explain the often encountered
divergence between studies and more seriously, may ulti￾mately result in misinterpretation of data [18]. The suit￾ability of a particular reference gene thus depends on the
system being investigated and the inherent experimental
conditions [21,19,18].
Recent studies have shown differences in reference
gene expression in omental fat tissue between lean and
obese patients. In addition there is strong evidence to
suggest that obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D)
exert a detectable influence on reference gene expression
in subcutaneous and visceral fat depot [1,2]. In light of
these findings, it is crucial for studies involving visceral
adipose tissues to validate the stability of the reference
genes being used.
Increasing concerns about normalization using ideal
reference genes have led to the development of several
mathematical algorithms aimed at determining the stabil￾ity of reference genes [22]. In 2002, Vandesompele et al.
have developed the software GeNorm that addresses the
critical issues of reference gene validation and ranks can￾didate reference genes according to their expression sta￾bility using raw, non-normalized expression levels. Pfaffl
et al. have developed similar software, BestKeeper that
takes into account Ct values of candidate reference genes
instead of relative quantities. This software employs a sta￾tistical algorithm wherein the Pearson correlation coeffi￾cient for each candidate reference gene pair is calculated
along with the probability of correlation significance of
the pair. Andersen et al. used a model-based evaluation
strategy which ranks candidate genes with minimal inter
and intra-group variation and developed the software
NormFinder [23]. In all three softwares, the top ranked
genes are recommended for further use in the similar
experimental systems as endogenous controls.
In this study we used GeNorm [16]. NormFinder [23]
and BestKeeper [24] to validate candidate reference genes
suitable for qRT-PCR profiling experiments using visceral
adipose samples from obese and lean individuals with
and without diabetes.
Results
To determine the expression stability of eight selected
reference genes, RNA expression levels were measured in
19 visceral adipose tissue samples (10 obese visceral adi￾pose tissues and 9 lean visceral adipose tissue samples)
and cross-validated using three popular algorithms
GeNorm v3.4 [16], NormFinder [23] and BestKeeper [24].
Genes encoding for 18S, beta-actin (ACTB), glyceralde￾hyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), beta-2-
microglobulin (B2M), hypoxanthine guanine phosphori￾bosyl transferase1 (HPRT1), tyrosine 3-monooxygensae/
tryptophane 5- monooxygenase activation protein, zeta
polypeptide (YWHAZ), ubiquitin C (UBC) and RNA
polymerase II (RPII, or POLR2A) were selected according
to previously published studies that relied on these genes
as reference controls [2,19,11]. For each tissue sample,
expression stability of each gene was calculated using the
mean Ct values. The input data for BestKeeper algorithm
was raw Ct values, while the analysis using GeNorm and

NormFinder converted raw Ct values to relative quanti￾ties using the comparative Ct method [16].
GeNorm Analysis
Investigation of raw non-normalized data of 5 obese and
4 lean visceral adipose tissue samples (n = 9) allowed
sorting of genes ranked on the basis of their expression
stability (M) from least stable to most stable (18S T
YWHAZ T UBC T B2M T GAPDH T HPRT1 T RPII and
ACTB). The respective individual M values compared to
the other candidate genes were 0.581, 0.501, 0.446, 0.421,
0.377, 0.295, 0.24 and 0.24 (Figure 1a). Successive elimi￾nation of the least stable genes based on the highest M
values led to the identification of ACTB and RPII as the
two most stable reference genes. To determine the effect
of sample size on the analysis, analysis was done with
additional 5 obese and 5 lean visceral adipose tissue sam￾ples (n = 19). Yet again ACTB and RPII were found to be
the most stable genes. However the ranking of the least
stable and intermediate genes was slightly changed. Sort￾ing of genes from least stable to the most stable revealed
UBC as the least stable (UBC T 18S T B2M T YWHAZ T
HPRT1 T GAPDH T RPII and ACTB). The respective
individual M values compared to the other candidate
genes were 1.43, 1.17, 0.88, 0.69, 0.59, 0.56, 0.44 and 0.44
(Figure 1b). Thus increasing sample size did not alter the
ranking of the most stable genes indicating the robust￾ness of GeNorm.
Pair-wise variation calculated between two sequential
normalization factors (NFn and NFn+1) for all genes indi￾cates the sufficiency of these two reference genes for
accurate normalization (Figure 2a, b).
NormFinder
Analysis of the gene expression of candidate reference
genes in the two subgroups: 5 obese visceral fat and 4 lean
visceral fat tissue samples, found HPRT1 and GAPDH as
the two genes with the lowest stability values (Table 1).
Further manual inspection for genes with lowest inter
group variations showed that although UBC ranked third
it had the highest intra-group variation after 18S. The
next two genes in the stability ranking, B2M and ACTB
had similar inter-group variation but B2M had slightly
higher intra-group variation. RPII was ranked below
B2M, and was found to have a slightly higher inter-group
variation and minimal intra-group variation. Thus, using
assistance of the process of elimination, GAPDH, HPRT1,
ACTB, B2M and RPII were considered as the best candi￾date reference genes (Figure 3a). To assess the robustness
of this model, sample size was increased to include addi￾tional 5 obese and 5 lean visceral adipose tissue samples

(n = 19). The ranking, however led to a different set of
stable genes. Genes were now ranked similar to GeNorm
with RPII and ACTB as the most stable (Table 2). Sorting
the remaining genes on basis of inter and intra group
variability showed GAPDH, YWHAZ, HPRT1 as the next
most stable genes (Figure 3b). Thus NormFinder results
varied with increase in sample size and with larger sample
set the results are in agreement with GeNorm analysis.
BestKeeper Analysis
Unlike GeNorm and NormFinder, input data for analysis
by BestKeeper was raw Ct values of each gene. Initial anal￾ysis of the data with 9 samples calculated variations (SD
(± Ct) and CV (%Ct)) for all the candidate reference genes
in the samples, and showed the overall stability in gene
expression. None of the candidate reference genes under
study showed a SD value higher than 1 indicating that all
of the genes under study were suitable to be considered
for selection as reference genes.
However, further data processing using pairwise corre￾lation and regression analysis assessed the inter-gene
relations and eliminated 18S, as the gene with the highest
variation (CV = 4.36) and least correlation (r = 0.434).
The lowest variation was seen for the gene YWHAZ (CV
= 0.96). However, YWHAZ demonstrated only a weak
correlation to BestKeeper index compared to other candi￾dates (r = 0.653). Therefore, both 18S and YWHAZ were
excluded from further analysis. Subsequent elimination
singled out UBC and B2M as genes with low correlation
with the BestKeeper index. The analysis of the remaining
four genes (HPRT1, ACTB, GAPDH and RPII) showed a
strong and significant correlation (0.914 < r < 0.960)
between their expression levels and the BestKeeper index
(p < 0.001).
To further assess the consistency and reliability of the
BestKeeper index, sample integrity of all four tightly cor￾related genes was investigated. The InVar values of all
samples were found to have low CP variation as well as
low x-fold expression regulation. Ranking the four tightly
correlated genes on the basis of variation from the most
stable to the least stable was as follows: GAPDH T HPRT1
T ACTB T RPII, and yielded the best genes for defining a
robust standardizing index. Amongst these four genes
ACTB and RPII were the most highly correlated (0.975 < r
< 0.981) to the BestKeeper index (Table 3).
In order to determine the influence of sample size on
robustness of this algorithm, additional 5 obese and 5
lean visceral adipose tissue samples (n = 19) were

included in the analysis. Further data processing using
pairwise correlation and regression analysis assessed the
inter-gene relations and eliminated UBC, as the gene with
the highest variation (CV = 10.93) and least correlation (r
= 0.350). 18S gene showed similarly a high variation (CV
= 12.99). Therefore, both UBC and 18S were excluded
from further analysis. Subsequent sequential elimination
based on low coefficient of correlation singled out B2M
and HPRT1 as genes with low correlation with the Best￾Keeper index. The analysis of the remaining four genes
(YWHAZ, GAPDH, ACTB and RPII) showed a strong and
significant correlation (0.831 < r < 0.904) between their
expression levels and the BestKeeper index (p < 0.001)
(Table 4).
Ranking the four tightly correlated genes on the basis of
variation from the most stable to the least stable was as
follows: YWHAZ T GAPDH T ACTB T RPII, and yielded
the best genes for defining a robust standardizing index.
Amongst these four genes ACTB and RPII were the most
highly correlated (0.975 < r < 0.981) to the BestKeeper
index (Table 2).
Discussion and Conclusions
To eliminate non-biological variation, gene expression
analysis involving qRT-PCR requires stringent normal￾ization strategies. Among the several approaches pro￾posed, use of reference genes is currently the preferred
way of normalization [22]. However, the use of improper
reference genes is known to lead to erroneous results
[25]. Importantly, the studies of the expression levels for
the reference gene themselves, particularly, for GADPH
and ACTB [20], showed considerable variation in differ￾ent tissues and experimental conditions. Specifically in
omental and subcutaneous fat depots, a variation in
expression of these reference genes was found to be
dependent on the presence of obesity and type 2 diabetes
mellitus (T2D) [2]. These findings necessitate the need to
validate reference genes for studies of human visceral adi￾pose samples.
Scientifically, the validation of reference genes presents
a circular problem: assessing stability of expression of a
given gene cannot be achieved without using another
gene as a reference. Several algorithms have been pro￾posed to address this conundrum [22]. GeNorm software
[16] is one of the most popular algorithms for validating
candidate reference genes with low variability. It utilizes
two parameters to quantify the reference gene expression
stability: M (average expression stability) and V (pairwise
variation). A low M value is indicative of a more stable
expression, hence, increasing the suitability of a particu￾lar gene as a reference gene. Another feature of GeNorm
is that it does not require a normal distribution of data.
However, co-regulation of candidate genes does seem to
influence the efficiency of this algorithm due to the use of
pair-wise comparisons. To minimize this risk, the eight
candidate reference genes selected for this analysis were
chosen on the basis of the difference in their physiological
functions-cytoskeleton (ACTB), carbohydrate metabo￾lism (GAPDH), signaling pathways (YWHAZ), transcrip￾tion (RPII or POLR2A), metabolic salvaging of
nucleotides (HPRT1), protein synthesis (18S) and protein
degradation (UBC).
The GeNorm algorithm determines expression stability
(M) via a pair-wise comparison of one candidate refer￾ence gene and all other candidate genes independent of
the level of gene expression for each sample. An identical

expression ratio of two reference genes in all samples is
used as an indicator of expression stability. Thus GeNorm
analysis is independent of variation in amount of starting
material between samples. According to this analysis,
ACTB and RPII represented the best combination of ref￾erence genes for visceral adipose tissue among lean and
obese patients (Figure 1a), while HPRT1 and GAPDH
were ranked third and fourth, respectively. After comple￾tion of this step, a pairwise variation (V) was calculated
between two sequential normalization factors (NFn and
NFn+1) for all genes. A large variation indicates that the
added gene has a significant effect and should be
included for calculation for a reliable normalization fac￾tor. Figure 2a, b show that further inclusion of additional
reference genes did not significantly increase the pair￾wise variation and that the use of two reference genes is
sufficient for accurate normalization. An advantage to the
GeNorm algorithm is that it is minimally affected by
expression intensity of the candidate genes. In addition,
since the approach is based on multiple pair-wise com￾parisons, the need for large sample size is mitigated. This
was reinforced by the observation that increase in sample
size did not dramatically alter the final results. On
increasing sample size from 9 to 19, ACTB and RPII were
again found to be the most stable genes with GAPDH and
HPRT1 being ranked the next two best genes (Figure 1b).
Housekeeping genes, in addition to their basic func￾tions, exert pleiotropic effects on other cellular systems,
decreasing the value of the function-based predictions of
co-regulation. To overcome this problem Anderson et al.,
proposed a model based approach incorporated into the
software NormFinder. This algorithm ranks candidate
reference genes according to the least estimated intra and
inter group variation, which serves as an effective method
to overcome the influence of co-regulation. Although
NormFinder takes into account the heterogeneity in the
tested samples, and attempts to distinguish between sta￾bility and bias, this model-based approach is self￾restricted by the importance it places on overall expres￾sion intensity of each candidate gene. A close inspection
of the analysis of the results produced by NormFinder
showed that it biased towards candidate reference genes
that have overall similar expression values (in terms of
Ct). Consequently, the robustness of this method is linked
to the sample size.
The ultimate objective of NormFinder is to identify
candidate reference genes(s) with an inter group variation
as close to zero as possible, while at the same time having
small intra-group variation. When the genes were ranked
solely by their stability values, GAPDH and HPRT1
appeared to be the best combination of endogenous con￾trols (Table 1). Further examination of the results reveals
that although UBC was ranked third, its intra-group vari￾ation was large (Figure 3a), therefore, UBC gene was
eliminated from further consideration leaving the next
most stable reference genes: ACTB, B2M and RPII.
The same genes, GAPDH, HPRT1, ACTB and RPII,
were ranked as the most stable both by GeNorm and
NormFinder softwares. However, the best combinations
of two genes proposed by these two algorithms were dif￾ferent. This variation was expected based on the vastly
different approaches used by each of the analysis soft￾wares and dependence of robustness of NormFinder on
sample size. In GeNorm, gene expression stability (M)
based on the expression ratio of the two genes (pairwise
comparison) is the most important criteria for evaluating
a reference gene, while NormFinder focuses on genes
with the least intra and inter group variations. Thus, in
cases when two genes show high expression variation
while their ratio (M) remains unchanged, there will be
discordance in ranking by the two algorithms.
Further, NormFinder gains in robustness as the number
of samples is increased. This was confirmed by increasing
sample size to 19. Ranking of genes from most stable to
least stable revealed - ACTB and RPII as the best combi￾nation of genes and this was in accordance with with
GeNorm results (Figure 3b).
In contrast to the previous study by Catalan et al., in
visceral adipose tissue samples both the algorithms high￾lighted 18S as one of the least stable gene. This was not
unexpected, as several arguments against the use of
rRNA as reference genes have been previously put forth.
The strongest argument against its use in real time RT￾PCR data analysis is its high abundance compared to
other target mRNA which hinders accurate subtraction
from the baseline value [16].

BestKeeper calculates the stability measure for each candidate gene and then ranks them from the most to the least stable (SD [± x-fold]). The 
coefficient of correlation (r) and the p-value measure the correlation between each gene and the BestKeeper index. Genes that ranked the 
best are highlighted.

In order to compare the GeNorm and NormFinder
results with an independent ranking method, the data
was also analyzed with the BestKeeper tool [24]. In this
approach, ideal reference genes are expected to have sta￾ble expression, indicated by low variation in the tissue
under consideration [24]. With BestKeeper, stability (SD)
and relationship to the BestKeeper index (r and p values)
are the two most important criteria for evaluating the sta￾bility of reference genes. This algorithm uses a pair-wise
correlation analysis for all pairs of candidate genes based
on the raw Ct values and calculates the geometric mean
of the best suited ones. Based on low CV and high coeffi￾cient of correlation (r) to the BestKeeper index, ACTB and
RPII followed by GAPDH and HPRT1 were ranked as the
top four genes (Table 3). High correlation coefficient is an
indicator of stable expression of the reference genes in
visceral adipose tissue. Again, 18S was ranked as the least
stable and excluded from further analysis. Robustness of
the algorithm was assessed by increasing sample size (n =
19). Sample size was found to have minimal effect on the
results. The same two genes ACTB and RPII were identi￾fied as the most stable followed by YWHAZ and GAPDH
(Table 4).
Overall, the BestKeeper results were in line with the
NormFinder data, and with minor differences, the
GeNorm data, indicating the reliability of the validation
for reference genes in the present study (Table 2). Regard￾less of the algorithm used, all three software ranked the
same set of genes as the most stable.
In conclusion, we recommend ACTB and RPII as stable
reference genes most suitable for gene expression studies
of human visceral adipose tissue. The use of these genes
as a reference pair may further enhance the robustness of
qRT-PCR in this model system.
Methods
Samples
Visceral adipose tissue samples were obtained from 10
patients diagnosed with morbid obesity and one of the
NAFLD spectrum diseases (n = 10) and nine lean patients
with normal liver biopsies (n = 9). Samples were collected
at the time of bariatric or other intra abdominal surgery.
Samples were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored in
-80°C. The samples were de-identified in compliance with
HIPAA regulations and this study was approved by Inova
IRB.
Selection of reference genes
Candidate reference genes previously reported as house￾keeping genes in adipose tissue were selected as follows:
18S, beta-actin (ACTB), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (GAPDH), beta-2-microglobulin (B2M),
hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase1
(HPRT1), tyrosine 3-monooxygensae/tryptophane 5-
monooxygenase activation protein, zeta polypeptide
(YWHAZ), ubiquitin C (UBC) and RNA polymerase II
(RPII, or POLR2A).
ACTB, GAPDH, B2M and HPRT1 were obtained from
Real Time Primers (Real Time Primers, USA). 18S was
synthesized as described previously [26]. Primers for the
remaining three genes, RPII, YWHAZ and UBC, were
custom designed to span intron-exon boundaries using
Oligo Perfect Designer software (Invitrogen, USA) and
synthesized commercially (Invitrogen, USA). All primers
were confirmed using the NCBI Blast tool against all
available mRNA sequences to ensure specificity. Gene
accession numbers as well as primer sequences are listed
in Table 5.
RNA extraction and reverse transcription
Total RNA was extracted from visceral adipose tissues (n
= 19) using mirVana RNA extraction kit (Ambion, USA)
according to manufacturers protocol. Purity of total RNA
was determined as 260 nm/280 nm absorbance ratio with
expected values between 1.8 - 2.00 by the
GeneQuant1300 spectrophotometer (GE Healthcare,
USA). RNA integrity was confirmed by gel electrophore￾sis using 1% agarose with ethidium bromide [Additional
file 1]. 112 ng of extracted total RNA was reverse tran￾scribed using RT2 first strand kit (SABiosciences, USA).
According to manufacturer's protocol, total RNA was
treated to eliminate genomic DNA and random hexamers
and oligo-dT primers were used to prime reverse tran￾scription.
Quantitative real-time analysis
Quantitative real-time PCR was performed in a 96 well
format in the Bio-rad CFX96 Real Time System (BioRad
Laboratories, USA). The real-time PCR mixtures con￾sisted of 5 μL cDNA corresponding to ~600 ng total
RNA, 0.1 uM of Real-Time primers or 0.2 nM of Invitro￾gen primer and 1× Sso Fast Evagreen Supermix ( BioRad,
USA ) in a final volume of 15 μL. The assay included no
template and RT minus controls to detect reagent con￾tamination and presence of genomic DNA. The thermal
profile of the RT-PCR procedure repeated for 50 cycles
was: 1) 95°C for 10 min; 2)10 s denaturation at 95°C, 40 s
annealing at 55°C for Real Time primers and 60°C for
Invitrogen primers (amplification data collected at the
end of each amplification step); 3) dissociation curve con￾sisting of 10 s incubation at 95°C, 5 s incubation at 65°C, a
ramp up to 95°C. (Bio-rad CFX96 Real Time System,
USA). Melting curves were used to validate product spec￾ificity. All samples were amplified in triplicates from the
same total RNA preparation and the mean value was used
for further analysis.

Determination of reference gene expression stability
To assess stability of expression of candidate reference
genes across all samples three different statistical algo￾rithms - GeNorm, v3.4, NormFinder v0.953 and Best￾Keeper v1, were used according to developer's
recommendations.
qRT-PCR GeNorm Analysis
The GeNorm tool was used to calculate candidate refer￾ence gene stability values (M) using raw non-normalized
expression values. For each pair of genes, GeNorm calcu￾lates a pairwise variation in terms of the standard devia￾tion (Vjk) of each gene' logarithmically transformed
expression ratios (aij) for each tissue sample (m), for any
combination of two internal control genes (j or k):
(?j, k 8 [1, n] and j ≠ k) [22]:
Expression stability measure (Mj
) is calculated as the
mean of pairwise variation of a gene compared to that of
all other genes [22].
In iterative steps of exclusion, genes with the lowest
expression stability (i.e. the highest Mj value) are
removed. This procedure is repeated until only the genes
with the lowest Mj values and most stable expression
remain. The minimum number of genes for which the
pair-wise variation Vjk/Vjk+1, is smaller than 0.15, is used
to define the optimal number of reference genes. The
normalization factor is calculated based on the geometric
mean of the final optimal set of reference genes.
qRT-PCR NormFinder Analysis
The NormFinder Excel plug-in was used as an alternative
algorithm to the GeNorm algorithm for determining suit￾able reference genes in adipose tissue. GeNorm, unlike
NormFinder, uses a model based approach to determine
expression stability of control genes. Normfinder uses raw
non-normalized data in the form of expression values
generated using the comparative Ct - method. The Norm￾Finder algorithm estimates the overall expression varia￾tion of the candidate genes and the variation between
sample subgroups using the following model-based
approach [23]:
The three components of the model being: the general
expression level for candidate gene i within group g (αig),
the amount of mRNA in the sample j (βgj) and the ran￾dom variation caused by biological and experimental fac￾tors (εigj). The objective is to find the two genes with the
least intra- and inter-group expression variation. Confi￾dence intervals on the inter-group variances are indicated
by averages of intra-group variances and represented as

error bars on inter-group variances. The program algo￾rithm combines the intra-group (σ2
ig) and inter-group (zig
- θg, g = 1,...,G) variation and expresses it as a stability
value (ρig) for each investigated gene where γ2 is the vari￾ance of expression levels (αig) [23]:
This expression effectively combines multiple sources
of variation, and indicates the overall systemic error per
gene. Therefore the top ranked gene (which has the
smallest stability value, hence the smallest combined vari￾ation) is the candidate reference gene most stably
expressed in the sample set being investigated. However,
since the systemic error value (ρig) is calculated with the
null assumption that expression levels of each gene will
be group independent, further manual inspection of inter
and intra-group variability was performed. As can be
derived from the mathematical expression of the model,
this approach gains in robustness as the number of sam￾ples is increased.
qRT-PCR BestKeeper Analysis
BestKeeper calculates the gene expression variation for all
individual housekeeping genes based on crossing points
(CP), as defined by the number of cycles necessary to
reach the selected threshold fluorescence [27]. Initial
analysis of the data, based on the inspection of raw CP
values calculates standard deviation (SD (± CP) and coef￾ficient of variance CV (% CP) for all the reference genes
in all of the samples and is used to determine the stability
of gene expression. According to the variability observed,
reference genes are ranked from the most stable expres￾sion: exhibiting lowest variation, to the least stable one
with the highest variation. All stably expressed reference
genes are combined into an index (BestKeeper index) for
the respective sample using the geometric mean of each
candidate gene's CP values [24].
BestKeeper calculates the relationship between each
gene by pair-wise correlation analyses, assigning each
combination a Pearson correlation coefficient (r) and a
probability (p) value. The highly correlated genes are
combined into an index and used to calculate the rela￾tionship between each candidate reference gene and the
index. This serves as an estimate of inter-gene relations
and indicates the degree of contribution for each refer￾ence gene. Since occurrences of outliers among samples
can interfere with the accuracy of the analysis, BestKeeper
analyses sample integrity (InVar) for differences in
respective CP values (n) and for the average CP value of
each reference gene (m) [24].
BestKeeper then tests each reference gene sample integ￾rity value by subjecting it to the following analysis [24]:
Samples with efficiency corrected intrinsic variation
within 3 fold over or under expression are considered
acceptable. Hence the BestKeeper software seeks to elimi￾nate outliers and thereby increases the reliability and con￾sistency of the BestKeeper index.
