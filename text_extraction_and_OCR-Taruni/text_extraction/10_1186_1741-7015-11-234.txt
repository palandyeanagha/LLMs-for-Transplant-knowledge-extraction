Managing HIV/hepatitis C co-infection in the era
of direct acting antivirals
Jürgen K Rockstroh1* and Sanjay Bhagani2,3
Abstract
Morbidity and mortality from co-morbid hepatitis C (HCV) infection in HIV co-infected patients are increasing;
hence, the management of hepatitis co-infection in HIV is now one of the most important clinical challenges.
Therefore, the development of direct acting antivirals (DAAs) for treatment of HCV has been eagerly awaited to
hopefully improve HCV treatment outcome in co-infected individuals. Indeed, the availability of the first HCV
protease inhibitors (PI) boceprevir and telaprevir for HCV genotype 1 patients has changed the gold standard of
treating hepatitis C allowing for substantially improved HCV cure rates under triple HCV-PI/pegylated interferon/
ribavirin therapy. Moreover, numerous other new DAAs are currently being studied in co-infected patient
populations, also exploring shorter treatment durations and interferon-free treatment approaches promising much
easier and better tolerated treatment regimens in the near future. Nevertheless, numerous challenges remain,
including choice of patients to treat, potential for drug-drug interactions and overlapping toxicities between HIV
and HCV therapy. The dramatically improved rates of HCV cure under new triple therapy, however, warrant
evaluation of these new treatment options for all co-infected patients.

Introduction
The introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy
(HAART) in 1996 and the resultant sustained control of
HIV replication and consequent immune reconstitution,
has decreased HIV associated morbidity and mortality
dramatically. Consequently, liver disease, mostly as a re￾sult of chronic viral hepatitis co-infection, has emerged
as one of the most important causes of non-AIDS
associated morbidity and mortality in HIV infected
patients [1]. HIV and hepatitis C viruses share similar
rules of transmission leading to a high rate of hepa￾titis C co-infection among patients with HIV. Overall
it is estimated that around 25% of all European HIV
patients have concomitant hepatitis C virus (HCV)
co-infection [2,3]).
In the natural course of hepatitis C in HIV, in the
absence of antiretroviral therapy, a faster progression of
hepatic fibrosis has been observed. This is particularly
true in patients who develop CD4 counts below 200
cells/mm3 or develop AIDS [4]. This enhanced fibrosis
progression may be a result of the direct fibrogenetic ef￾fect of HIV in the liver and a likely consequence of HIV
induced impairment of the innate and adaptive immune
system leading to more inflammation, apoptosis and fi￾brosis [5]). Importantly, successful anti-HIV therapy can
slow down the accelerated cause of fibrosis progression
in HIV/HCV co-infected patients, emphasizing the im￾portance of maintaining high CD4 counts in these pa￾tients [6]). However, despite attenuation of faster fibrosis
progression with successful HAART, some patients con￾tinue to develop hepatocellular carcinoma and advanced
liver disease. Therefore, the treatment of HCV is of the
utmost clinical importance. Although the introduction
of pegylated interferon (pegIFN) and ribavirin (RBV)
combination therapy simplified HCV treatment and was
associated with improved response rates, the outcome of
treatment remained unsatisfying particular for genotype
1 and 4 patients where cure rates defined as sustained
virological response (negative HCV PCR 24 weeks after
stopping therapy) (SVR) was not higher than 22 to
35% [7-9]. The development of direct acting antivirals
(DAAs) against HCV promising higher cure rates in this

challenging patient population have led to substantial
hope that better treatment options have finally arrived.
In 2011, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) ap￾proved the use of the first two DAAs, boceprevir and
telaprevir, for the treatment of HCV genotype 1 infection
in mono-infected patients. Subsequently, the first pilot
trials with the use of these compounds in HCV treat￾ment naïve as well as HCV treatment experienced HIV/
HCV co-infected patients have been presented. To date,
the results of the studies suggest excellent treatment re￾sponse rates with SVRs in the range of 60 to 80% and an
increase in SVRs by 29 to 35% when pegIFN and RBV
were used as comparators [10-13]. Despite this, treat￾ment of HCV in HIV remains complex with multiple
challenges, including high pill burden, higher rates of ad￾verse events (AEs) and difficult drug-drug-interactions
commonly seen between HIV drugs and HCV protease
inhibitors that need to be addressed. From a clinician’s
perspective this calls for practical clinical algorithms
which could help in the day-to-day management of these
patients. This review aims at summarizing the currently
available data on treatment of chronic HCV with DAA￾based therapy and to provide guidance and whom to
treat now and where to wait for improved options in the
near future. Management of acute HCV is outside the
scope of this article.
Pegylated interferon and ribavirn therapy in HIV/HCV
co-infection
Until recently, dual therapy with pegIFN and RBV has
been the gold standard for HCV therapy in HIV co￾infected individuals. Overall SVR rates have been bet￾ween 25 to 50%, with cure rates approaching 70 to 80%
in HCV genotype 2 or 3 infection and considerably
lower at between 18 to 38% in HCV genotype 1 and 4
patients [14]. Treatment uptake, however, was very low,
mostly due to the fear of high adverse event rates (in
particular, central nervous system (CNS) toxicity) associ￾ated with pegIFN/RBV combination therapy, a high rate
of comorbid medical and psychiatric conditions repre￾senting a contraindication for dual HCV therapy cou￾pled with high cost of therapy and a high proportion of
genotype 1 infections with low SVR rates. Indeed, data
from the EuroSIDA cohort suggest that not more than
25% of all European HIV/HCV co-infected patients have
ever received anti-HCV therapy [15]). However, it needs
to be emphasized that cohort studies evaluating the clin￾ical outcome of HCV therapy have demonstrated that
achieving SVR is associated with a significant decline in
risk of liver-specific and all-cause mortality in patients
with HCV mono-infection as well as in HIV/HCV co￾infection. In the Veterans Affairs HCV mono-infection
population, SVR was associated with a marked reduction
in all-cause mortality [16]). Similarly, in the Spanish
GESIDA HCV/HIV cohort, SVR was accompanied by a
significant decrease in liver-related complications and
mortality as well as non-liver-related mortality [17,18].
Interestingly, in more recent analyses, HIV/HCV co￾infected patients with end-of-treatment response but re￾lapse after stopping dual HCV therapy developed less
liver-related mortality, decompensations and liver stiffness
progression than treatment non-responders, suggesting a
benefit from successful HCV viremia suppression to the
end of a finite treatment course, even if a cure was not
achieved [19]. Therefore, for HIV patients with genotype
2,3 and 4 where no licensed DAAs are currently available,
dual HCV therapy with pegIFN and RBV remains the gold
standard. The current treatment algorithm for these HCV
genotypes is summarized in Figure 1.
Direct Acting Antivirals (DAA) in HIV/HCV co-infection
Resolution of the three-dimensional structures of several
HCV proteins, together with the development of replica￾tive cell culture systems, has led to the identification of a
number of potential targets for DAAs [20]. Numerous
families of drugs that potently inhibit the HCV life cycle
in vitro have been identified, and many of these mole￾cules have reached early to late clinical development.
Two NS3-4A protease inhibitors, telaprevir and bocepre￾vir, were the first DAAs to become approved in Europe
and the United States in 2011 in combination with
pegIFN-α and RBV for the treatment of HCV genotype 1
infection. Numerous other DAAs are at the clinical deve￾lopmental stage in combination with pegIFN and RBV or
with other DAAs in IFN-free regimens, with or without
ribavirin. They include first-generation, second-wave and
second-generation NS3-4A protease inhibitors, NS5B
polymerase inhibitors, inhibitors of non-structural protein
5A and host-targeted agents, such as cyclophilin A inhibi￾tors and microRNA-122 antagonists.
Currently licensed DAAs for HCV therapy in treatment-na
ïve HIV/HCV patients
Recently, two pilot studies, one with boceprevir- and
one with telaprevir-based HCV therapy, have been pub￾lished with full SVR24 results in treatment-naïve HIV/
HCV co-infected patients and are briefly summarized
below [10,11].
A phase IIa, double-blind study in 98 HCV/HIV co￾infected patients investigated the safety and efficacy of
boceprevir in combination with PegIFN-α-2b and weight￾based dose ribavirin [10]. Patients were randomly allo￾cated (1:2) according to a computer generated sequence,
stratified by Metavir score and baseline HCV RNA level,
to receive pegIFN-alpha-2b 1.5 μg/kg per week with
weight-based RBV (600 to 1,400 mg per day) for four
weeks, followed by pegIFN/RBV plus either placebo
(control group) or 800 mg boceprevir three times per

day (boceprevir group) for 44 weeks. All patients were
HCV-treatment naïve and had genotype 1 HCV infection.
The majority of patients included in the study were male
(69%), Caucasian (82%), non-cirrhotic (95%) and had a
HCV viral-load >800,000 IU/ml (88%). In addition, they
were mostly on HAART, with an undetectable HIV viral
load and CD4 cell count >500 cells/mm3
. The antire￾troviral therapeutic combinations used in the study were
predominately based on boosted protease inhibitor (PI)
(>90%). Non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors,
zidovudine and didanosine were not permitted. A total of
40 (63%) of 64 patients in the boceprevir group had an
SVR at follow-up Week 24, compared with 10 (29%) of 34
control patients (difference 33.1%, 95% CI 13.7 to 52.5;
P = 0.0008). Adverse events were more common in pa￾tients who received boceprevir than in control patients:
26 (41%) versus 9 (26%) had anemia, 23 (36%) versus 7
(21%) pyrexia, 22 (34%) versus 6 (18%) had decreased ap￾petite, 18 (28%) versus 5 (15%) dysgeusia, 18 (28%) versus
5 (15%) vomiting, and 12 (19%) versus 2 (6%) neutropenia.
Three patients who received boceprevir plus pegIFN/RBV
and four controls had HIV virological breakthrough.
A phase IIa, randomized, double-blind, placebo￾controlled study in 62 HCV/HIV co-infected patients
investigated the safety and efficacy of telaprevir in com￾bination with PegIFN-α-2a and 800 mg RBV (US) and
weight-based dose RBV in France and Germany [11]). A
total of 62 patients with HCV genotype 1 infection and
HIV-1 infection who were HCV treatment-naive were
enrolled in the study. Patients were required to be re￾ceiving no antiretrovirals (part A) or one of two specified
antiretroviral regimens (part B), including either efavir￾enz or ritonavir boosted atazanavir. Patients in part A
were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio and patients in
part B were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive
telaprevir or placebo, both in combination with PEG￾IFN-α-2a and ribavirin for 12 weeks, plus 36 weeks of
PEG-IFN-α-2a and ribavirin. Analyses of all patients
from the different treatment arms showed that SVR oc￾curred in 74% (28 in 38) of patients receiving telaprevir
plus PEG-IFN-α2a/RBV and 45% (10 in 22) of patients
receiving placebo plus PEG-IFN-α-2a/RBV. Rapid HCV
suppression was seen with telaprevir plus PEG-IFN￾α-2a + ribavirin (68% (26 in 38 patients) vs. 0% (0 in 22
patients) undetectable HCV RNA levels by Week 4).
Two patients had on-treatment HCV breakthrough with
telaprevir-resistant variants. Patients treated with antire￾troviral drugs had no HIV breakthroughs; antiretroviral
exposure was not substantially modified by telaprevir.
Pruritus, headache, nausea, rash and dizziness were
higher with telaprevir plus pegIFN-α2a/RBV during the
first 12 weeks. During this period, serious adverse events
occurred in 5% (2 in 38) of those receiving telaprevir
plus pegIFN-α-2a in combination with RBV and 0%
(0 in 22) of those receiving placebo plus pegIFN-α-2a
and RBV; the same number in both groups disconti￾nued treatment due to adverse events.
In summary, both pilot trials in naïve HIV/HCV co￾infected patients have demonstrated statistically super￾ior treatment outcome responses in patients receiving
DAA-based HCV therapy over dual therapy with pegIFN/
RBV alone. Therefore, within the European AIDS Cli￾nical Society (EACS) hepatitis co-infection guidelines
(please also see http://www.europeanaidsclinicalsociety.
org/), HCV treatment in HCV genotype 1 patients is re￾commended with triple therapy, including either of the
HCV protease inhibitors boceprevir or telaprevir in com￾bination with pegIFN and RBV where available.

First licensed DAAs in HCV treatment experienced
HIV/HCV patients
At the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic
Infections (CROI) 2013 meeting in Atlanta, first re￾sults were presented from two Agence Nationale de
Recherche sur la SIDA (ANRS) studies which looked at
the efficacy and safety of triple HCV therapy (either with
telaprevir or boceprevir) in previous non-responders to
dual pegIFN/RBV therapy [12,13]. Patients with previous
null-response and cirrhosis were excluded because of
the overall low probability of treatment response. Both
studies were presented as pre-planned interim analyses
at Week 16 of therapy. In the telaprevir ANRS HC26
study at the interim analyses, 69 patients who received
at least one dosage were included [12]. Background HIV
therapy contained atazanavir (ATV), ritonavir-boosted
atazanavir (ATV/r), efavirenz (EFV), raltegravir (RAL),
tenofovir (TDF), emtricitabine (FTC) or lamivudine
(3TC). Patients started with a four-week lead-in of
pegIFN/RBV. This approach, which is outside the label￾ing of telaprevir, was chosen so the investigators could
compare the results to the boceprevir study, which had a
lead-in period of four weeks and because data from tela￾previr studies in HCV mono-infection in treatment ex￾perienced patients had potentially promised some
benefit for this approach. After Week 4, telaprevir was
added for12 weeks. Patients who achieved a complete
rapid virological response at Week 8 (RVR8) defined as
HCV-RNA <15 IU/mL received 32 weeks of pegIFN/
RBV after stopping telaprevir at Week 16 following12
weeks of triple therapy (full treatment: 48 weeks).
Whereas patients who only obtained a partial RVR8
(15 IU/mL < HCV-RNA <1,000 IU/mL) received an ad￾ditional 56 weeks of pegIFN/RBV (full treatment: 72
weeks). Telaprevir was administered as 750 mg q8h
(1,125 mg q8h with EFV) and pegIFN α-2a as 180 μg sc/
week. Ribavirin was dosed as 1,000 mg/day (≤75 kg) and
1,200 mg/day (>75 kg). Futility rules for telaprevir were
HCV-RNA >1,000 IU/mL at Week 8 or Week 12 or
virological breakthrough at any time. For study inclusion
patients needed to have CD4 ≥200 cells/mm3 and ≥15%,
as well as plasma HIV-RNA levels <50 copies/mL. At
baseline, the median CD4-count was 630 cells/mm3
(range 459 to 736) and HIV-RNA was below 50 c/ml
in 99% of patients. Eleven (18%) patients had Metavir
F3 fibrosis and 16 (23%) had F4 fibrosis at inclusion
into the study. A total of 39% of patients were previ￾ous relapsers to dual therapy, 9% had previous viral
breakthrough, 22% were partial responders and 30% null￾responders. With 88% achieving an undetectable HCV￾RNA at Week 16 in this patient population comprising of
30% previous null-responders and 40% with F3/F4 fibrosis,
this study has achieved surprising high early efficacy
results. Most interestingly, efficacy remained high
independent of a previous response to dual HCV therapy
(early virological response at Week 16 (EVR16) was 86% in
relapsers versus 86% in previous null-responders) or base￾line fibrosis stage (EVR16 was 92% in F1 and 94% in F4
patients). Concomitant antiretroviral therapy (ART) also
had no impact on early virological response. Adverse
events were frequent (99% of patients developed an AE)
but were mostly related to pegIFN side effects. A total of
4% (n = 3) of patients discontinued study drugs because of
psychiatric adverse events and cutaneous adverse events,
respectively. Noteworthy, in contrast to the pilot trial in
HCV treatment-naïve patients where no telaprevir discon￾tinuation because of rash was recorded, a few discontinua￾tions because of rash did occur in this study. Grade 3 to 4
anemia, erythropoietin (EPO) use, transfusion or RBV
dose reduction was recorded in 61% of patients.
The second ANRSstudy looked at the efficacy and safety
of a boceprevir containing triple therapy in 64 previous
IFN/RBV non-responders [13]. Following a lead-in with
dual therapy, boceprevir was added at Week 4. Boceprevir
was discontinued in all patients with a HCV viral load
above 1,000 IU/ml at Week 8 and/or at Week 12. All
HCV drugs were discontinued if HCV viral load was
>1,000 IU/ml at Week 16 or still detectable at Week 28 or
in case of virological breakthrough. Patients who achieved
a complete rapid virological response at Week 8 (RVR8)
defined as HCV-RNA <15 IU/mL received another 40
weeks of triple therapy. Patients who at Week 8 had an
HCV viral load >15 IU/mL but <1,000 IU/mL triple ther￾apy continued for four more weeks. If their HCV viral load
at Week 12 was again >15 IU/mL but <1,000 IU/mL, they
received an additional 36 weeks of triple therapy followed
by a further 12 weeks of pegIFN/RBV. Patients recruited
for the trial had to be on stable ART for at least three
months, with at least three molecules among ATV (rito￾navir boosted or not), RAL, TDF, ABC, FTC or 3TC.
Again, only previous non-responders to dual therapy with
HCV genotype 1 infection were included. Overall, 17% of
patients had Metavir F4 fibrosis at baseline and 33% were
previous null-responders. Overall, 63% achieved undetect￾ability at Week 16, which was slightly higher in the RAL￾treated patients than in patients on other ART regi￾mens. Response rates at Week 16 were best for previ￾ous relapsers (with 90% <15 IU/ml) versus patients
with previous breakthrough (60% <15 IU/ml), partial
responders (60% <15 IU/ml) and null-responders (38% <15
IU/ml), respectively. Response rates according to fibrosis at
baseline in contrast were comparable between the different
fibrosis stages (62% <15 IU/ml at Week 16 with F1, 67%
for F2, 50% for F3 and 73% for F4). Anemia occurred in
42% of patients but only 5% developed grade 3 to 4 anemia.
A total of 42% of the patients received concomitant EPO.
Both of these studies show very impressive early treat￾ment response rates independent of baseline fibrosis

stage (please note that patients with prior null-response
and F4 fibrosis, however, were excluded from the trial).
Whether the good early response rates can be main￾tained and translate into good SVR rates remains to be
seen, as at this time these studies are still ongoing. It is
noteworthy, however, that triple therapy studies in HCV
treatment-experienced patients (see the ANRS CO20-
CUPIC trial) also showed good early treatment response
rates, which, however, did not translate to high SVR
rates after the end of therapy [21]. Moreover, similar to
CUPIC, significant hematological toxicity was observed
in these studies despite proactive management of
anemia. However, significant drop-out rates as a result
of SAEs were not seen by Week 16. Moreover, in the
CUPIC trial, there was a considerable incidence of se￾vere complications and death, especially in patients with
low platelet counts and low albumin. This has not as yet
been reported in the early results from the ANRS co￾infection trials but needs to be borne in mind with respect
to treating patients with advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis with
currently available triple therapy. These patients should be
managed withincenters with experience in looking after
co-infected patients with advanced liver disease.
Trial results with new DAAs in HIV/HCV co-infected
individuals
At present, several other HCV trials are currently taking
place in the HIV/HCV co-infected patient population
and early treatment response rates from these studies
have already been presented at conferences. Among the
DAA anti-HCV drugs, the three most likely to be licensed
in 2014 is the once-daily nucleotide analogue HCV poly￾merase inhibitor sofosbuvir, as well as the second￾wave, once-daily HCV protease inhibitors simeprevir
and faldaprevir. For both HCV protease inhibitors, data
from co-infection trials are available and summarized
below [22,23].
STARTVerso4 is an open-label, sponsor-blinded stu￾dy in HCV/HIV co-infected patients who were HCV
treatment-naïve (TN) or relapsed after previous HCV
therapy to assess the efficacy and safety of faldaprevir q.
d. plus pegIFN/RBV, and to evaluate 24-week treatment
duration in HIV/HCV co-infected patients [22]. Patients
in arm A were treated with faldaprevir at 120 mg/pegIFN/
RBV for 24 weeks; Arm B: faldaprevir at 240 mg/PegIFN/
RBV for 12 weeks then re-randomization at Week 12 to a
further 12 weeksof faldaprevir/pegIFN/RBV or pegIFN/
RBV alone. For response-guided therapy, early treatment
success (ETS) was defined as a HCV RNA below the limit
of quantitation at Week 4 and below the limit of detection
at Week 8. At Week 24, ETS were re-randomized to stop
treatment at Week 24 or continue pegIFN/RBV through
Week 48. Patients without ETS received pegIFN/RBV
through Week 48. Patients on HIV protease-based ART
or efavirenz were allocated to faldaprevir 120 mg or 240
mg q.d., respectively; those receiving other allowed ART
(raltegravir or maraviroc) or no ART were randomized to
either dose. The primary endpoint of the study is SVR12.
Overall, 304 (239 treatment naïve and 69 relapsers) pa￾tients were included, making this the largest co-infection
DAA study so far. Importantly, 17% of the patients in￾cluded had F4 fibrosis, 78% GT1a and baseline HCV RNA
was ≥800,000 IU/mL in 80% of patients.
Early virological treatment response up to Week 12
was excellent in naïve as well as in previous relapsers.
ETS was observed in 80% of patients with half of these
patients being able to stop treatment at Week 24. This
study will provide very interesting data on potentially
shorter treatment durations in HIV/HCV co-infected
subjects for the first time in the near future. The adverse
event profile was comparable to adverse events observed
with faldaprevir and pegIFN/RBV in HCV mono-infected
patients [23]. A total of 18% of patients developed anemia
and 18% a rash. Two rashes were documented as SAEs.
The other second wave HCV protease inhibitor study
evaluated efficacy and safety of simeprevir based triple
therapy in HIV/HCV co-infection in study C212. C212
is a phase III, open-label, single-arm, international trial
assessing simeprevir (150 mg q.d.) plus pegIFN/RBV in
treatment-naive and -experienced patients (N = 106) co￾infected with genotype-1 HCV and HIV-1 [24]. Patients
who were treatment-naïve and non-cirrhotic (n = 50) or
prior relapsers (n = 14) received a response-guided treat￾ment (RGT) regimen of simeprevir (150 mg once daily)
for 12 weeks plus pegIFN/RBV for 24 or 48 weeks. Prior
partial (n = 10) or null (n = 28) responders and patients
with cirrhosis (three treatment-naïve patients and one
relapser) received treatment for 48 weeks. The primary
endpoint of the study was again SVR12, as well as safety
and tolerability. Combination HCV therapy with sime￾previr 150 mg q.d. + pegIFN/RBV led to high virologic
response rates in co-infected patients, regardless of prior
response (SVR12 77% in treatment-naïve and prior re￾lapsers). Relapse occurred only in patients infected
with HCV genotype-1a: 5/31 overall population; 3/22
treatment-naive; 2/9 prior relapsers. A total of 64% of
all prior null responders had not experienced failure
at the time of the interim analysis. Of the 88% of pa￾tients who met RVR, 75% achieved SVR 12; 30% of
patients developed grade 3 or 4 events. A rash was
reported for 17% of the patients. Hyperbilirubinemia
(a known side effect of simeprevir) was noted in 5%
of study subjects. However, only 4% of patients dis￾continued simeprevir because of adverse events. Over￾all, simeprevir was well tolerated, with a safety profile
similar to that in HCV mono-infected patients.
In summary, these trials suggest that simplified DAA￾based HCV therapy will become available very shortly,
Rockstroh and Bhagani BMC Medicine 2013, 11:234 Page 5 of 9

promising for a smaller tablet burden, with at least equal
efficacy compared to the current triple therapy regimens
but with better tolerability. Further co-infection studies
include studies with daclatasvir, a NS5A inhibitor, as well
as the first interferon-free studies with sofosbuvir. No in￾terim results from these studies, however, have been
publically presented to date.
Who to treat now, where to wait?
With the rapid advances in HCV therapy making simpli￾fied and better tolerated HCV therapy with higher cure
rates a realistic vision within the next two years, current
treatment algorithms need to balance the need for pre￾venting liver disease progression and occurrence of he￾patocellular carcinoma against the side effects of current
therapies and improved treatment options in the near
future. Therefore, the first essential step in HCV treat￾ment decision-making is fibrosis stage assessment, as
the current fibrosis stage of a patient reliably predicts
subsequent clinical risk of developing relevant liver dis￾ease. In patients with low fibrosis stages, treatment can
be safely deferred as risk of liver disease progression,
particularly in the setting of controlled HIV replication,
is low and, therefore, patients could wait for newer treat￾ment options. Patients with more advanced liver fibrosis
stages, however, are at risk of developing more severe
liver disease associated complications and can be poten￾tially cured now with the currently available DAA-based
treatment regimens. Figure 2 shows the management al￾gorithm of persons with newly diagnosed HCV infection,
which is adapted from the EACS guidelines [25]). Be￾sides the fibrosis stage, previous response to interferon￾and ribavirin-based dual HCV therapy is also important
information in the decision making process. All studies
to date have shown that relapsers, in particular, are most
likely to benefit from DAA-based HCV re-treatment
and, therefore, are preferred candidates, whereas patients
with previous null-response (defined as less than 2 log
drop in HCV-RNA levels under pegIFNIFN/RBV) ther￾apy are much less likely to respond. Waiting for more
potent DAA combinations is probably the best strategy for
this group if fibrosis stage allows this (see Figure 3). It is im￾portant to bear in mind that if this is the case, careful moni￾toring of fibrosis progression would be essential.
While a number of new DAA-based therapies and
IFN-free therapies, including combinations within fixed￾drug combination tablets are in phase 2 and phase 3
clinical trials for mono-infected patients, there are an in￾creasing number of studies underway or in the planning
stage for co-infected patients. These include the IFN￾free combination of sofosbuvir and ribavirin for G1, 2, 3
and 4 patients, a combination of Peg-IFN-lamda (a po￾tentially better tolerated IFN) with ribavirin and the
NS5a inhibitor daclatasvir also for G1, 2, 3 and 4 in￾fections and ABT-450/r, a ritonavir-boosted protease
inhibitor together with NS5a inhibitor ABT-267, non￾nucleoside polymerase inhibitor ABT-333 combined
with ribavirin for G1 patients. There is no doubt that
better-tolerated, more efficacious and potentially IFN￾free regimens are on the horizon for co-infected patients.
Practical recommendations: CD4-count level and
drug-drug interactions
Cure rates of HCV therapy in HIV co-infection have
been demonstrated to increase with higher CD4 relative
percentage above 25%, and undetectable HIV-RNA has
been suggested to be independently associated with im￾proved SVR rates ([26]. Therefore, in patients with a
CD4-count <500 cells/mm3 early ART initiation is re￾commended to optimize HCV treatment outcome. Only
a Metavir fibrosis score: F0 = no fibrosis; F1 = portal fibrosis, no septae; F2 = portal fibrosis, few septae; F3 = 
bridging fibrosis; F4 = cirrhosis; Peg, pegylated interferon; RBV, ribavirin

in patients with a CD4-count above 500/μl without HIV
therapy should HCV treatment in the absence of HIV
therapy be considered. This strategy offers the advantage
of decreased pill burden, lack of overlapping toxicities bet￾ween HIV and HCV drugs and no drug-drug interactions.
As HCV protease inhibitors, as well as HIV protease
inhibitors and NNRTIs, are all metabolized by the cyto￾chrome p450 pathway, multiple complex drug-drug in￾teractions exist between HCV and HIV drugs. Table 1
summarizes the corresponding drug interactions. Telapre￾vir can currently only be safely combined with boosted
atazanavir, raltegravir, maraviroc, rilpivirine, etravirine or
efavirenz (with EFV, telaprevir doses need to be increased
to 1,125 mg every eight hours) in combination with teno￾fovir or abacavir and FTC or 3TC (please also check www.
hep-druginteractions.com). Due to drug-drug interactions,
boceprevir can only be currently safely combined with
raltegravir, rilpivirine or etravirine in combination with
tenofovir or abacavir and FTC or 3TC. The European
Medicines Agency (EMEA) has also suggested considering
boceprevir in combination with boosted atazanavir in pa￾tients with no previous HIV treatment failure and no drug
resistance who have suppressed HIV-RNA when starting
HCV therapy as boceprevir exposure is not impacted by
concomitant boosted atazanavir, whereas atazanavir area
under the curve (AUC) decreased significantly but trough
levels remained above the recommended IC90 in all pa￾tients. It is not possible to co-administer simeprevir with
HIV protease inhibitors. Faldaprevir can be combined
with ritonavir boosted darunavir but the dose needs to be
reduced to 120 mg once a day. So far, first results from
interaction studies with sofosbuvir, which is not metabo￾lized by the cytochrome p450 pathway, indicate that this
compound can be combined with darunavir/r, atazanavir/
r or efavirenz [27], thereby apparently offering more HIV
treatment choices along with HCV therapy.
Taking into consideration all the complex issues sur￾rounding anti-HCV treatment in this group of patients, par￾ticularly drug-drug interactions and side-effects, it is
important that these patients are managed in centers with
experience in managing HCV/HIV co-infected patients.
Many physicians may want to start HCV/HIV co-infected
patients on cART therapies that will have the least potential
for drug-drug interactions, although it would be possible to
switch cART during the period of DAA-based therapy. It is
important to ensure that all co-medications, and not just
cART components, that patients are on are documented
and scrutinized for potential drug-drug interactions with the

new DAAs. It is also imperative that as many patients as
possible are included in the forthcoming clinical trials.
Conclusion
HCV therapy has also dramatically changed with the advent
of the first DAAs in the HIV/HCV co-infected population
with the promise of much higher cure rates and potentially
shortened treatment durations. Nevertheless, complex drug
interactions as well as significant additional toxicities and
challenging overall management issues have limited the up￾take of these new treatment strategies to date. With easier
to take, better tolerated and optimally interferon-free HCV
treatment approaches on the horizon in the very near future,
HCV treatment initiation can be delayed in all patients with
low fibrosis stages. For patients with more advanced fibrosis,
however, the new treatment modalities should at least be
discussed in order not to miss out on further liver disease
progression and HCC development.
