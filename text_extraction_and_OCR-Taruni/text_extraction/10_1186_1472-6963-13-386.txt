Abstract
Background: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a significant global health problem, especially in China. Chronic
liver disease affects health related quality of life (HRQOL). The intervention method to improve HRQOL in patients
with hepatitis B has been one-dimensional with inconsistent results. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the
effect of comprehensive intervention on health-related quality of life and provide guidance on improving HRQOL
for patients with chronic hepatitis B.
Methods: Patients with chronic hepatitis B eligible for our study were randomly selected in three model regions of
Jiangsu Province in June 2010. 272 patients were invited and 254 took part, with a refusal rate of 6.62%.
Comprehensive intervention included government support, technical guidance from the Chinese Centre for Disease
Control and Prevention, standardised medical care, and community involvement. HRQOL before and 1 year after
intervention was measured with the Short Form 36 and HBV-specific health surveys. Chi-square test, t-test and
multiple linear regressive analyses were used.
Results: After comprehensive intervention, the HRQOL in patients with chronic hepatitis B showed significantly
improvements in bodily pain, vitality, social functioning, and mental, as well as physical and mental component
score (p < 0.05). Family and social support increased, and financial concerns decreased (p < 0.05). Marital status,
duration of illness-related absence from work, education level, family financial status, and health insurance type
were important factors affecting HRQOL change between the baseline and final assessment in patients with
chronic hepatitis B.
Conclusion: The comprehensive intervention was effective in improving the HRQOL of patients with chronic hepatitis B.

Background
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a significant global
health problem. An estimated two billion people world￾wide have been infected with the hepatitis B virus and
more than 240 million have chronic liver infections.
About 600000 people die every year due to the acute or
chronic consequences of hepatitis B [1]. The prevalence
in China is high and includes an estimated 120 million
asymptomatic carriers and 6.9 million people infected
with HBV, with a prevalence as high as 7.9% [2,3].
Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) increased the risk of liver fail￾ure and hepatocellular carcinoma. It imposes consider￾able economic burden on a family [4]. The incidence
rate of hepatitis B ranks first, and the mortality rate
ranks third, among all infectious diseases. In 2005, viral
hepatitis, AIDS, tuberculosis, and schistosomiasis were
listed as the four most important infectious diseases for
prevention and control in China [5]. For successful dis￾ease control, comprehensive intervention is essential. In
2010, the Ministry of Science and Technology in China

launched a major project in the model regions for infec￾tious disease prevention and control [6]. This compre￾hensive intervention to improve HRQOL for chronic
hepatitis B patients was one of the most important
study areas for this project.
Recently, increased attention has been given to the pa￾tients’ opinions regarding their health status in measures
such as health-related quality of life (HRQOL), which is a
subjective indicator for evaluation of physiological, psycho￾logical and social dimensions. HRQOL has been measured
widely in clinical and health service management [7,8]. Cer￾tain studies have shown that chronic liver disease affects
HRQOL [9-12]. However, few studies have evaluated
HRQOL for patients with hepatitis B, and the results from
these studies have not been consistent [13-17]. Some stud￾ies on HRQOL and related impact factors in patients with
hepatitis B patients have been conducted in China [18-22].
These studies have primarily focused on the impact of
drug therapy on HRQOL [23,24]. In recent years, some re￾searchers have begun to study the effect of psychological
intervention and self-management on HRQOL in patients
with chronic liver disease [25,26]. However, there has not
been any government-led study in the model regions about
the effects of comprehensive intervention on HRQOL and
related impact factors in patients with hepatitis B. The
prevalence of hepatitis B is high in China and the control
measures in some regions are not standardised, with poor
effective management and inadequate policy support.
Therefore, a multidimensional approach is considered to be
important in the treatment and management of these pa￾tients. However, few studies have evaluated this in a system￾atic approach.
The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects
of comprehensive intervention through comparing the
changes in patients with chronic hepatitis B patients before
and 1 year after comprehensive intervention. We also ana￾lyzed the main factors that affect HRQOL. These results
would provide guidance on improving HRQOL and com￾prehensive management of chronic hepatitis B patient.
Methods
Study design
This study was conducted in major model regions for in￾fectious disease prevention and control in Jiangsu Prov￾ince, China from June 2010 to May 2011. The Jiangsu
Provincial Centre for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) initiated and assigned this programme. Patients
with chronic hepatitis B eligible for our study were ran￾domly selected in June 2010. The patients were recruited
by doctors under the instruction of research assistants.
Comprehensive intervention was performed for 1 year.
The study had obtained study the approval of the Ethics
Committee of the Jiangsu Provincial Centre for Disease
Control and Prevention.
Study participants
Two hundred seventy-two patients were invited and two
hundred fifty-four took apart in the end, the refused rate
6.62%. Two hundred fifty-four patients with hepatitis B
were involved before intervention, and two hundred
twenty-eight patients remained 1 year after intervention
began, while twenty-six patients dropped out during inter￾vention with at a rate of 11.4%. The primary reasons for
leaving the programme included relocation and patient
drop-out during intervention. The study objectives and de￾sign were explained to all patients. Afterwards they signed
the informed consent.
Criteria for the inclusion of participants were: According
to the 2010 Manual of Prevention and Management of Viral
Hepatitis in China [27], we included patients with various
types’ acute and chronic hepatitis B, liver cirrhosis; liver can￾cer, and liver transplantation, however, only chronic hepatitis
B patients were included in the study. Patients were ex￾cluded if they were acute hepatitis B, liver cirrhosis, liver
transplantation, liver cancer and other liver diseases not
caused by HBV.
Kendall suggested that the sample size of Health-related
quality of life was 10 times of the variable number. Our
sample size was calculated by it. The variable number is
about twenty, so the sample size is about two hundred.
Two surveys were conducted in June 2010 (pre-intervention)
and in May 2011 (post-intervention) by the trained inves￾tigators using the questionnaires. Flow diagram of partici￾pants’ progress in the trial is showed in Figure 1.

(Figure 2). According to the requirements of the Minis￾try of Science and Technology for projects on infectious
disease prevention in the model regions, the compre￾hensive intervention from June 2010 to May 2011 in￾cluded the following: government policy support from a
programme funded by the Ministry of Science and
Technology in China that supports major and specific
projects through increasing health insurance funds and
establishing a special leadership group, as well as par￾tially free treatments and examinations; technical guid￾ance from the CDC for hepatitis B patients through
establishment of a standardised medical care manage￾ment system and electronic health records with disease
information; the technique offer for the community;
implementing standardised medical care through train￾ing doctors; regular medical examination(Including the
more patients in antiviral medication), with monthly
follow-up by telephone or home or clinic visit; and
community involvement, such as lectures and films that
provide information on hepatitis B, disseminating health
education aimed at enhancing patient knowledge and
improving HRQOL, as well as gaining family and social
support. Therefore, comprehensive intervention involv￾ing multiple departments in physiological, psychological
and social aspects of care was implemented for chronic
hepatitis B patients. The project was performed by the
CDC, university and hospitals.
HRQOL and measurement instruments
HRQOL was measured at months 0 and 12 using two
questionnaires: the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item
Short-Form Survey (SF-36) Chinese Mainland version 1
[28] and a HBV-specific health survey.
SF-36 consisted of eight dimensions: physical function￾ing (PF), physical role functioning (RP), bodily pain (BP),
general health (GH), vitality (VT), social functioning
(SF), emotional role functioning (RE), and mental health
(MH). Each scale contained 2–10 items, totalling 36
items, which could be reduced to two summary scores:
a physical component score (PCS) and a mental com￾ponent score (MCS). The PCS included the PF, RP, BP
and GH scales, and the MCS included the VT, SF, RE
and MH scales. For each question, the raw score was
transformed into a scale from 0 (worst possible health
state) to 100 (best possible health state). Each scale and
total score were calculated in accordance with the cor￾responding formula [29].
In addition, we designed a HBV-specific health survey
to assess HRQOL according to the characteristics of pa￾tients with hepatitis B and other related studies. The sur￾vey consisted of six scales, including concerns for health
and responsibility, family and social support, a psycho￾logical tendency toward hostility, concerns over eco￾nomic status, doctor support, and the sense of being
discriminated against. The choices for each item ranged
from “all the time” to “none of the time”. For the first
four scales, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 indicated all of the time,
most of the time, some of the time, a little of the time,
and none of the time, respectively. For the latter two
scales, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 indicated none of the time, a little
of the time, some of the time, most of the time, and all
of the time, respectively. The score from each scale was

transformed into a 0–100 score, and higher scores indi￾cated better HRQOL.
The patients completed the questionnaires in outpatient
clinics by face-to-face interviewer. Before the investiga￾tion, a pilot study was conducted in some patients and the
questionnaire was modified according to the results of the
pilot study. The reliability and validity of SF-36 are well
documented in a range of language versions, including
Chinese. Cronbach’s α coefficient of internal consistency
for each scale was 0.70–0.90. They all reached the stand￾ard of 0.70, which demonstrated the good reliability of the
questionnaire. Structural validity of the questionnaire was
reflected by factor analysis of principal component ana￾lysis and varimax orthogonal rotation, and KMO index
was 0.855. Bartlett statistic was χ2 = 1142.6, p < 0.001. Fac￾tor cumulative contribution of variance was 72.29%. Fur￾thermore, intercommunity of all indexes was >0.5, which
indicated good structural validity of the questionnaire. For
the surface validity and content validity, relevant experts
were invited to discuss the designed questionnaire. They
modified the items of inappropriate expression for ensur￾ing its surface and content validity.
Statistical analysis
The survey data were double-entered by two different
people with Epidata 3.1 software (http://www.epidata.dk/).
Epidata software was used to check for consistency between
the two sets of data entries for quality assurance. Any dis￾crepancies between two people were resolved such that the
data entered were a true reflection of that recorded. The
quality of data was ensured by setting up logic constraining
conditions and valid value ranges of relevant variables. Cat￾egorical variables were analysed using χ2 test, the measure￾ment data were analysed using t test, and a paired t test
was used to compare the related scales for HRQOL in pa￾tients with chronic hepatitis B at baseline and after the final
intervention. Multiple linear regression analyses were used
to analyse the factors that affected HRQOL. All analyses
were performed in SPSS17.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA),
with 0.05 set as the required level of significance.
Results
Patients’ socio-demographic characteristics
The socio-demographic characteristics of the patients
were shown in Table 1. Overall, they had a mean age of
43.1 years (range: 13–78), and were mostly male (72.9%).
They were mainly middle school or higher (82.8%). 85.4%
reported the family economic status fair.
SF-36 HRQOl scores
Using the differences in the scores before and after inter￾vention (score after intervention subtracted from the score
before) as an index, we compared the changes in HRQOL
for each scale in patients with chronic hepatitis B by the
paired t test (Table 2). After 1 year intervention, the scores
for PF, RP, GH, and RE were not significantly improved,
but the scores for BP, VT, SF, and MH, as well as PCS and
MCS scores were significantly improved (p < 0.05).
HBV-specific health survey scores
The scores of HBV-specific health survey were showed
in Table 3. The scores for family support and concerns
over economic status were significantly improved after
intervention (p < 0.05). However, there were no signifi￾cant changes in scores for concerns over health and re￾sponsibility, psychological trends toward hostility, doctor
support, and the sense of being discriminated against.
Factors that affect HRQOL
Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to
identify the effect of age, sex, marital status, education
level, family economic status, type of medical insurance,
chronic disease, years of infection, free treatment status,
duration of illness-related absence from work, educa￾tional material and activities (first column in Table 4) on
the change in the PCS, MCS of SF-36, and HBV-specific
health survey for HRQOL (first line in Table 4) between

the baseline and final assessment. The following factors
affected PCS: marital status, duration of illness-related
absence from work, whether educational material was
helpful, and educational level. The factors that affected
MCS included duration of illness-related absence from
work, and marital status. The factors that affected con￾cerns over health and responsibility included duration of
illness-related, absence from work and family economic
status. The factors that affected the family and social
support scale included marital status, whether to partici￾pate in publicity educational activities for HBV, and
whether the educational materials were helpful. The fac￾tors that affected psychological trends in the hostility
scale included duration of illness-related absence from
work, whether to participate in publicity educational ac￾tivities for HBV, medical insurance type, and whether
the patient had chronic disease. The factor that affected
concerns over economic status was duration of illness￾related absence from work. The factors that affected the
doctor support scale included duration of illness-related
absence from work, whether to participate in publicity
educational activities for HBV, and whether the educa￾tional materials were helpful. The factors that affected the
sense of being discriminated against included duration of
illness-related, absence from work and whether to partici￾pate in publicity educational activities for HBV.
Discussion
There is a shift in focus from specific clinical outcomes
to generic ones, such as quality of life which an import￾ant means of assessing the results of therapeutic and
other interventions. Quality of life is a subjective indica￾tor for evaluations in the physiology, psychology and so￾cial dimensions which is widely applied in clinical and
health service management [7,11]. The aim of our study
was to evaluate the effect of comprehensive intervention
on HRQOL in patients with chronic hepatitis B. After
the implementation of the comprehensive intervention
in the major model regions for infectious disease preven￾tion and control in Jiangsu Province, China, for 1 year,
there were improvements in HRQOL. Although the SF￾36 scores for PF, RP, GH, and RE did not improved sig￾nificantly, the scores for BP, VT, SF, MH, PCS and MCS
improved significantly after intervention. In the HBV￾specific health survey, family and social support was in￾creased, and concerns over economic status were signifi￾cantly reduced after intervention. However, the concerns
over health and responsibility, doctor support, sense of
being discriminated against, and psychological trends to￾ward hostility did not change. Therefore, we should fur￾ther strengthen the support provided by family, society
and doctors; supply more care; and reduce social dis￾crimination for patients with chronic hepatitis B.
We compared our results with other studies. Our study
showed that at baseline, the scores of patients with chronic
hepatitis B for PF, RP, BP, GH, VT, RE, SF, MH were signifi￾cantly worse that of the general population from the Pan'
study [30]. The results from the studies about HRQOL for
patients with hepatitis B have not been consistent [13,17,26].
Bondini et al. showed that patients with hepatitis B had
similar HRQOL scores as the healthy individuals [13]. When
compared with Hong Kong patients, our patients had better
scores for BP, GH, and VT scales [31], but they had worse
scores for physical health, RP, SF, RE, and psychological
functioning scales. The intervention greatly improved both
SF and MH in patients with chronic hepatitis B. The scores
for the eight HRQOL scales in our patients with chronic
hepatitis B were significantly higher than those for patients

in Hebei at baseline and after intervention [21]. The patient
may develop negative psychological thoughts, as well as
physical and social symptoms, because of HBV infection
[9]. Certain studies have suggested that proper use of anti￾viral medications (such as entecavir and lamivudine) could
improve health status, prolong lifespan, and improve QOL
[9,32]. However, these studies have primarily focused on
using drug treatment to reduce clinical complications in pa￾tients with hepatitis B. Sharif et al. have studied the impact
of psychological intervention on QOL in patients with
chronic liver diseases, and have shown that psychological
intervention improves scores for the psychological scales
[26]. These studies only used a single intervention method
(either medication or psychological treatment). The preva￾lence of hepatitis B is high in China and the control mea￾sures in some regions are not standardised, with poor
effective management and inadequate policy support. In
order to solve these problems, we used comprehensive
intervention that included combination of government sup￾port, technical guidance from the CDC, standardised med￾ical care, and community involvement, which clearly differs
from previous studies regarding the methods applied.
Our study analyzed the factors that affect HRQOL.
Marital status affected change in HRQOL between base￾line and final assessment. Changes in the scores for PCS
and MCS among married patients were larger. However,
the changes in family and social support were smaller
for married patients, while for widowed/divorced and
unmarried patients these changes were larger (β = 0.392,
p < 0.05; 0: married, 1: widowed/divorced and unmar￾ried). This may be that the family and social support of
widowed/divorced and unmarried patients were less
than the married patients and comprehensive interven￾tion could improve the support. For the patients who
could not work for illness-related reasons over a longer
duration, they had lower changes in the scores for the
PCS and MCS; concerns over health and responsibility;
and psychological trends toward hostility. When the dur￾ation of the illness-related absence from work was ≤3
days, the intervention-mediated positive changes in con￾cerns over economic status, doctor support, and the
sense of being discriminated against were larger com￾pared with patients who were absent from work for ≥11
days (β = −0.31, –0.290, –0.405; p < 0.05; 0: ≤3 days, 1:
4–10 days, 2: ≥11 day). A duration of 4–10 days resulted
in minimal changes. The patients who believed that edu￾cational material was helpful had larger changes in their
family, social and doctor support. Patients with higher
education levels had greater changes in the scores for
the PCS. Higher family economic status resulted in a
smaller change for concerns over health and responsibility.
Patients with urban employee/resident basic medical insur￾ance had the largest changes in psychological trends to￾ward hostility, which was followed by those with new rural
cooperative medical care. Those who pay their own ex￾penses had the smallest changes. Patients without chronic
diseases had larger changes in psychological trends toward
hostility than those with chronic diseases. To the best of
our knowledge, there was little evidence in analyzing the
factors influencing the intervention on the change of
HRQOL. Based on our analysis, the comprehensive inter￾vention used in this study could reduce psychological
trends toward hostility for patients with chronic hepatitis B,
as well as improve their family, social and doctor support.
In addition, we found that for patients who could not work
because of illness, the intervention was more effective for
those who were out of work for a shorter duration. There￾fore, intervention in chronic hepatitis B patients as soon as
possible is recommended and the support for the widowed/
divorced and unmarried patients should pay more. Ng et al.
showed that information and support they receive at the
early stage of the disease determine their adherence to fol￾low up and treatment [33], so it was important to educate
doctors on how to communicate the diagnosis and manage￾ment to patients accurately and sensitively. Some studies
have shown that older people have poorer QOL [17,31].
However, Lam et al. and others have shown that younger
female patients have lower QOL [31,32,34,35]. Our results
did not show an impact of age or sex on the comprehensive
intervention for chronic hepatitis B.
Miri et al. showed that the primary vertical route—
mothers—has shifted to horizontal routes of HBV trans￾mission [36]. Only the vaccine could not solve the HBV
infection problem. Nwokediuko suggested that numerous
challenges exist for effective management of chronic
HBV infection, particularly in resource-limited regions,
such as China, health education was a important method
[37]. In order to control the HBV infection, the compre￾hensive intervention should be considered. Our study
evaluated the effects of comprehensive intervention.
Several limitations of the current study should be
highlighted. Firstly, the focus of this study was to evaluate
the impact of comprehensive intervention on HRQOL in
patients with chronic hepatitis B patients in major model re￾gions. We did not evaluate a single intervention method,
such as the impact of standardised medical care or commu￾nity health education. Clearly, this feature of the study repre￾sents a possible limitation to future investigations. Secondly,
the study did not select other non-model regions as a
randomised control group. Thirdly, we did not compare
clinical parameters with patients with or without improve￾ment of life quality. The comparations of clinical parameters
between before and after intervention were done, there were
no significant changes. The reason was that the subjects we
studied were chronic hepatitis B, quality of life could change
in short time after intervention, but the changes of clinical
parameters need a long time. In the future, we will analyze
the change and effect of clinical parameters.

Conclusion
Our study suggest that a comprehensive intervention com￾bining government support, technical guidance from the
CDC, standardised medical care and community involve￾ment could be effective for improving the HRQOL of pa￾tients with chronic hepatitis B. The results showed that
physical pain, VT, SF, MH, PCS and MCS were significantly
improved after comprehensive intervention; levels of family
and social support were increased; and concerns over eco￾nomic status were decreased. The impact factors that af￾fected HRQOL for chronic hepatitis B patients included
marital status, duration of illness-related absence from
work, education level, family economic status, and type of
medical insurance. These would provide guidance on im￾proving HRQOL of chronic hepatitis B patient. Further
study may better demonstrate potential effect of the com￾prehensive intervention and impact factors.
