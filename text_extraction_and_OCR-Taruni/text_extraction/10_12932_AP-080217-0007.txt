Abstract
Background: Food allergy (FA) prevalence is increasing in pediatric liver transplantation (LT). However, the clinical course 
is still limited.
Objective: This retrospective cohort study aimed to identify the prevalence, risk factors, and the natural history of de novo
FA in children post LT.
Methods: Medical records of pediatric LT recipients from Jan 2001 - Dec 2014 were reviewed. De novo FA was diagnosed 
by symptoms after exposure to culprit food occurring after LT, and improvement after diet elimination. FA was confirmed 
if reproduced symptoms after re-challenge or documented sensitization or indicated gastrointestinal eosinophilia.
Results: Among 46 post LT children, 54.3% developed de novo FA at a median time of 12.2 months [Interquartile range
(IQR) 6.2, 21.3 months] post LT. The confirmed FA was 39.1%. Gastrointestinal symptom was the most common 
manifestation followed by skin, anaphylaxis, and others. Culprit foods were cow’s milk, shellfish, egg, wheat, soybean, 
peanut, coconut, fish and monosodium glutamate. The risk factors of FA were transplantation during age below 2 years 
[hazard ratio (HR), 2.62; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.04 - 6.59; p = 0.03), atopic history in family (HR, 5.67; 95% CI, 
1.33 - 24.12; p = 0.01), and Epstein-Barr (EBV) viremia (HR, 2.39; 95% CI, 1.02 - 5.63; p = 0.04).
Conclusions: de novo FA in pediatric LT is not uncommon. Age at LT younger than 2 years, family history of atopy, and 
EBV viremia are associated with developing FA. Development of tolerance after elimination culprit diets for 3 years is 
similar to general population.

Introduction
Food allergy (FA) is defined as an immune-mediated 
adverse reaction to food, divided by immunopathology to 
IgE-mediated, non IgE-mediated, and mixed type.1
 Over 
the past 2 decades, the prevalence of FA was doubled and its 
phenotypic expression increased in Westernized societies.2
In the US 28% of 480 children from birth cohort study 
reported adverse reactions to foods, but in only 8% of these 
reactions were reproduced.3
 In Thailand, the prevalence of 
adverse food reactions by questionnaire in school children 
under age of 7 years ranged from 6.25% to 13.1% and the 
prevalence of confirmed IgE-mediated FA by food challenge 
were 0.45% to 1.11%.4,5 However, the prevalence of FA are 
highlighted in some special conditions particularly the patients 
undergo solid organ transplantation.6
Presently, liver transplant (LT) is the treatment of choice 
in liver failure and provides an excellent outcome and survival
rate.7
 The quality of life and long term health aspects are 
increasingly concerned. Interestingly, the incidence of novel 
FA or de novo FA following LT has been reported to be 5 to 
57% in various populations but the pathogenesis remains 

Methods
Study design
Retrospective cohort study
Patients and Samples
Patients who underwent LT between Jan 2001 and Dec 
2014 were reviewed using patient’s records and telephone 
interviewing by one researcher. The patients who had survived
after LT at least 30 months were included in this study. 
Demographic data including gender, underlying diseases, 
indication for LT, age at LT, follow-up period, immunosuppres￾sive drug regimen, and atopic history such as allergic rhinitis 
(AR), asthma, atopic dermatitis (AD) and FA were collected. 
The FA history focusing on the onset, symptoms, treatment, 
and reaction after re-consumption either by incidence or 
intention were gathered. The evidence of sensitization was 
identified by skin prick test and specific IgE (sIgE). The 
patients were routinely followed-up by the gastroenterologists 
(ST and CL). Patients with suspected FA were evaluated and 
diagnosed by the allergists (RS and WM). De novo FA was 
defined as symptoms and/or signs of FA developed after LT. 
We classified FA into 2 groups which were confirmed and 
probable FA as the following criteria;14,15
Confirmed FA was defined as the symptoms and/or signs 
of FA that resolved after food elimination, combined with 
either reproducible symptoms and/or signs when reintroducing 
the culprit foods or the evidence of food sensitization (SPT or 
sIgE) or evidence of gastrointestinal eosinophilia without other 
specific causes.
Probable FA was diagnosed from a history of symptoms 
and/or signs of FA that improved after avoidance without the 
re-challenge of culprit foods, nor laboratory tests to confirm 
the food reactions. The other causes that mimic FA such as 
infection, drug adverse effects were excluded.
IgE-mediated FA included urticaria, angioedema, acute 
onset gastrointestinal or respiratory symptoms, and anaphy￾laxis. The reaction occurred within 2 hours after ingestion of 
the culprit foods.14 The evidence of food sensitization was used 
to support the IgE-mediated reaction.
Non IgE-mediated FA included subacute or delayed 
onset of gastrointestinal symptoms (> 2 hours after taking the 
culprit foods). They were food protein-induced proctocolitis, 
food protein-induced enterocolitis, and food protein-induced 
enteropathy.14
Asian Pac J Allergy Immunol DOI 10.12932/AP-080217-0007
Mixed IgE- and non-IgE mediated FA included moderate
to severe AD and eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders 
(EGIDs). In order to diagnose EGIDs, esophagogastroduo￾denoscopy and endoscopic biopsies were performed and the 
diagnosis was based on the abnormal numbers or distribution
of eosinophils in tissue histopathology.15
Evidence of food sensitization was determined by SPT 
or prick to prick (PTP) or sIgE. In SPT and PTP, histamine 
chloride and sodium chloride (0.9%) were used as positive 
and negative controls, respectively. Skin test applicator of 
Duotip-test (Lincoln Diagnostics, Illinois, USA) was performed 
on the skin at forearm for either the SPT or PTP. The standard 
food allergenic extracts (ALK Abelló, Port Washington, NY, 
USA) of cow’s milk, soy, wheat, egg yolk, egg white, and mixed 
shellfish were applied for SPT. The selected cooked and/or 
fresh foods were performed for prick-to-prick skin test (PTP) 
in cases of unavailable commercial standard allergen. The 
sIgE was measured by the ImmunoCAP assay (Thermo Fisher 
Scientific, Uppsala, Sweden). The wheal size > 3 mm larger than 
negative control in SPT and PTP or sIgE > 0.35 IU/mL were 
considered the positive result.
Outgrowing of FA was defined as the ability to re-consume 
the culprit foods without any reaction for more than 1 month.
Study protocol was approved by the Research Ethical 
Committee of the Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital.
Informed consent was obtained from a caregiver before 
enrollment in the study. 
Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed using the statistics package SPSS 17.0 
and Stata software version 12.0. A descriptive analysis was 
performed on all study variables, using median with quartile 
for numeric variables. The differences of baseline characteristic
were assessed by Chi-square and Mann-Whitney U test. 
Risk factors for de novo FA post LT were determined by the 
univariate analysis of log-rank test and presented as Hazard 
Ratio. Probability of having de novo FA post LT was described 
by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. The differences with a P
value less than 0.05 are considered statistically significant. The 
Log-rank test comparing two survival rates was calculated to 
determine the statistical power. 
elucidate.6,8-11 While the incidence of this condition was 
increasing, several risk factors such as tacrolimus use, EBV 
viremia and younger age at transplantation have been reported
but these remain inconclusive.8,9,12,13 Furthermore, the natural
history is also unclear leading to the reluctance of health 
care providers and child caregivers for dietary management. 
Therefore, this study aimed to 1) determine the prevalence of 
de novo FA, 2) identify risk factors of de novo FA, and 3) 
demonstrate the natural history of de novo FA in post LT 
children.
Results
Patient demographics
Between January 1, 2001 and Dec 30, 2014, a total of 52 
pediatric patients underwent LT at Ramathibodi Hospital. 
Forty-six patients survived and were eligible for including in the 
study. Twenty-five patients (54.3%) had de novo FA and 18 of 
them (39.1%) had confirmed FA (Figure 1). The demographic
data are described in Table 1 that the baseline characteristics 
were not different between de novo FA and non de novo FA 
except family history of atopy (p = 0.031). There were eight 
donors who reported the symptoms of allergic rhinitis and 
only one of shellfish allergy. Standard immunosuppression 
regimen was composed of tacrolimus starting within 24 hours

Among 85 items of allergic food items in 25 de novo FA 
patients, IgE-mediated FA was the most common reaction 
(49.4%), follow by mixed (29.4%), and non IgE-mediated 
reaction (21.2%). The major culprit foods were milk, soy, 
shellfish, hen’s egg and others (Table 2).
The presenting symptoms were gastrointestinal symptoms
(52%), followed by skin (urticaria/angioedema, eczema), 
anaphylaxis, anemia and respiratory (stridor) as described in 
Table 3. One case of multiple food allergy post LT has identical 
twins and his twin was healthy with no clinical of any atopic 
diseases.
Risk factors for de novo FA post LT 
Risk factors for de novo FA post LT were the age at LT of 
less than 2 years [hazard ratio (HR), 2.62; 95% confidence 
interval (CI), 1.04 - 6.59; p = 0.03), Epstein-Barr (EBV) viremia of 
more than 100 copies prior to developing FA (HR, 2.39; 95% CI,

fever, AD, FA, AR, and/or asthma (HR, 5.67; 95% CI, 1.33 - 24.12; 
p = 0.01) (Figure 2a-c). CMV viremia was found in 68% of de 
novo FA but none in non de novo FA group. The small number of 
patients in each group led to an insufficient statistical power to 
provide a conclusive analysis of risk factors for CMV, hepatitis
B, and herpes simplex virus infection in this population. 
Other factors including predisposing individual atopic history 
before LT, severity of end-stage liver disease that measured 
by Pediatric End-Stage Liver Disease (PELD) score, are not 
statistically different. Log-rank test comparing two survival 
rates of Ha = 0.76, Hazards ratio 2.39 (lowest HR in our study). 
The statistical power is enough at power of 80, total n = 48. 
The sub-group analysis of the biliary atresia participants were 
found the similar trend of the risk factors of FH of atopy (HR 
3.12;95%CI, 1.32-7.36; p = 0.009) and EBV viremia (HR 1.80; 
95%CI, 0.76-4.24; p = 0.182). However, the factor of age at LT < 
2 years was not enough to calculate.
Outgrowing of food allergy
Among 25 de novo FA patients, 19% develops tolerance to 
at least 1 food allergen after 3 years of elimination diet. Due to 
many patients had multiple FA, the outgrowing rate within 3 
years after food elimination was determined by numbers of food 
items. Of the total 85 items of culprit food, 35 (41.2%) items 
were reported of tolerance after re-challenge. The most common
outgrown food allergen were cow’s milk and wheat occurring in 
66.7%, followed by shellfish, egg, soy, and fish (Table 2).

LT. It was clearly higher than that of global and Thai children
but similar to previous reports of FA in pediatric LT. The 
prevalence of FA in normal population is approximately 1%
to 10.8% in westernized countries by food challenges and 3% 
to 35% by self-reported allergy.2
 In Thailand, the nationwide
survey of the FA has not been reported. However, two studies
of questionnaire survey and oral food challenge (OFC) in 
Bangkok (2005) and northern Thailand (2011) have shown 
the prevalence of FA of 13.1% (positive OFC 1.1%) in Thai 
preschool children and 6.25% (OFC 0.45%) in school children.4,5
Our study demonstrated the same prevalence as the several
worldwide reports of FA after LT which range from 6% to 
57%.9
 The prevalence rate of de novo FA in this study was high 
compared to other reports, possibly due to the selective criteria
of FA that we included all types of food allergic reactions; 
IgE-, non IgE-, and mixed types.
The pattern of FA presentation, types of reaction, food 
allergens, and outgrowing rate in LT children were mostly 
similar to those of normal children population. Our study 
demonstrated that gastrointestinal and skin manifestations 
were common presentations, and the most common reaction 
was IgE-mediated (49.4%). EGIDs were found in 4 cases or 
8.7% of survived LT which was relatively high when compared 
to the report of 4 in 10,000 in healthy children, however, this 
was similar to the previous reports of 3-26% in post-LT 
children.16-19
The significant culprit foods were cow’s milk, hen’s egg, 
shellfish, fish, wheat, and soy. Reactions to these ‘‘major 
allergens’’ are similar to those occurring in Thai children 
population.4,5 In addition, these are not different from previous
reports of de novo FA or food sensitization in children after 
LT.9
 Considering the common food allergens among Asian 
countries, cow’s milk protein was the most common in our study
Discussion
This retrospective study highlighted the high prevalence 
of de novo FA (54.3%) in the 46 survived children underwent 

Asian Pac J Allergy Immunol DOI 10.12932/AP-080217-0007
while Shoda et al. reported that wheat was the most common 
in de novo FA in Japan.20 Our finding of multiple food allergies, 
occurring approximately 2/3 (65.4%) of de novo FA patients, 
supported the consistence of published literature of de novo FA
in pediatric LT.6,8,21,22 Furthermore, they lead to multiple food 
avoidance causing the huge negative impact on the nutritional 
achievement and quality of life post LT.
Although, the prevalence of food allergy was high in our 
LT patients, the accumulative outgrowing rate during 3 years 
after food elimination reached 19%, particularly cow’s milk, 
soy, wheat, and egg allergies. These findings were similar to 
childhood FA in normal population for cow’s milk, hen’s egg, 
soy, and wheat which typically resolves by 3 years of age.2
 In 
addition, other studies have supported that de novo FA after 
LT is a transient condition and can be outgrown after food 
elimination for several years.21,23,24 Interestingly, our data 
presented a high rate of outgrowing of IgE-mediated shellfish 
allergy up to 2/3 which was contrast to the natural history in 
normal population showing a low chance to develop tolerance.25
The pathogenesis of de novo FA is unknown. Potential 
mechanism related to chronic tacrolimus use and imbalance
immunological function in liver themselves, have been 
hypothesized base on the reports in LT children both in 
retrospective, prospective, case-controlled, and in vitro 
studies.6,9,11,12,26,27 Chronic exposure to oral tacrolimus, the 
calcineurin inhibitor, might skew the Th2 response and alter 
gastrointestinal barrier, and eventually increases a risk of FA 
development due to the improper allergen exposure.28
However, the present study showed that outgrowing of de novo
FA patients did not related to a change in immunosuppressive 
protocol. Therefore, we speculate the potential etiologies of 
de novo FA are multifactorial rather than from long-term 
tacrolimus use only. More studies are required to identify the 
exact mechanism of de novo FA after LT.
Potential risk factors associated with de novo FA are 
controversial. Our study identified family history of atopy, 
young age at LT, particularly less than 2 years old, and EBV 
viremia as the risk factors. Several studies support our finding
that LT at young age contributes to de novo FA.11,16,27,29 The 
potential mechanism of young age and risk for de novo FA 
probably due to the immature immune tolerance mechanism 
in gastrointestinal and hepatic themselves.2,9 Other reported 
potential risk factors included high PELD score prior to LT, 
underlying liver diseases, immunosuppressive regimens and 
donor’s allergy.20,27,29 However, we could not demonstrate the 
association of these factors with de novo FA. The discrepancy 
of these results among studies could be due to a difference in 
study design, the definition of FA and outcome measurement of 
FA. Moreover, most of our LT patients were biliary atresia with 
the same level of severity of liver failure before LT and received 
the homogeneous immunosuppressive regimen.
EBV is a herpes virus with contagious and suspected
to be associated with several allergic diseases in normal 
population.30,31 Currently, the role of EBV infection in 
FA is controversial due to inconsistent results from both 
epidemiological and in vitro studies. It has been suspected to 
be either a risk or protective factor for FA.30,32 Contributing
factors for the variable results include the variety of EBV 
detection methods, the range of age group, co-infection with
cytomegalovirus (CMV), and the different endpoint outcomes 
(sensitization or allergy).8,30,33 Most of the study evaluated the
seroprevalence that may be inadequate to represent the viral
activity. EBV, particularly primary infection, may related
to atopic diseases due to it induces B cell proliferation and 
polyclonal antibody proliferation.31,32 In addition, it may 
transform human B cells, resulting in enhance interleukin-5 
production, and eventually may induce a chronic eosinophilic
inflammation and produce interleukin-4, which has an 
important role in promoting the production of the IgE 
antibodies.32,34 Therefore, we hypothesized that the EBV 
viremia which represents the reactivated EBV infection or 
viral replication, might exaggerate or precipitate the 
presentation of FA through activated IgE producing B cell 
proliferation and Th2 response. However, we did not examine
the IgE producing B cell during EBV viremia in our patients 
to prove our hypothesis which beyond the scope of this 
retrospective study. Whether EBV viremia is the co-incidence 
finding or causal association with de novo FA requires further 
investigations.
Sidorchuk et al. reported the interaction of CMV and EBV 
infection on allergic diseases (asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopic 
dermatitis, but not include food allergy) and sensitization in 
the birth cohort survey. They found that the sensitization to 
common airborne or food allergens tended to be more prevalent 
in children with CMV-seropositive particularly when combined 
with EBV-seronegative.35 In contrast, the present study detected 
both EBV and CMV viremia in patients with de novo FA with 
the CMV reactivation rate of 68% but none in those without 
FA, however, there was insufficient statistical assessment due to 
inadequate sample of CMV viremia in the latter group. The 
large cohort studies are helpful to clarify this association in de 
novo FA post LT.
To our knowledge, this study possibly be the first report 
of de novo FA after LT in Southeast Asia that could be our 
strength. In addition, we provided data of long-term follow-up 
that was enough to discover the long-term outcome of these 
allergic diseases. FA was also diagnosed by the same allergists 
and gastroenterologists with the standard supportive evidence 
of sensitization and tissue biopsy. However, the study had 
some limitations due to the nature of retrospective research, 
therefore, recall bias could occur such as uncertainty of timing
to develop or outgrowing of FA. The overestimation of the 
prevalence rate of de novo FA was also the concerned issue, 
nevertheless, we tried to diminish this issue by classifying the 
diagnosis of de novo FA to be confirmed and probable FA. The 
confirmed de novo FA was 39.1% which was still higher than 
normal children population. In addition, the patients who 
suspected de novo FA post LT had not designed to regularly 
re-challenge to evaluate the outgrown, thus, the precise timing 
of outgrown was difficult to clarify from this study.
In conclusion, de novo FA after LT in pediatric patients is 
not uncommon. It suggests that children after LT, carry a high 
risk for the development of new onset FA. Age at transplantation
less than 2 years, family history of atopy, and EBV viremia 
associated with the developing FA. Nevertheless, the natural
history of this de novo FA is similar to general pediatric 
population with food allergy with 19% of the patients develop
tolerance after 3 years of food elimination. The diagnosis is

challenging, therefore, high index of suspicion of FA should 
be considered in post-LT children. In addition, the larger
cohort study should be further conducted to enhance the 
understanding of de novo FA in post-LT children.
