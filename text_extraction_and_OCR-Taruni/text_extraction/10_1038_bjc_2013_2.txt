Background: Uterine sarcomas are characterised by early age at diagnosis, poor prognosis, and higher incidence among Black compared with
White women, but their aetiology is poorly understood. Therefore, we performed a pooled analysis of data collected in the Epidemiology of
Endometrial Cancer Consortium. We also examined risk factor associations for malignant mixed mullerian tumours (MMMTs) and endometrioid
endometrial carcinomas (EECs) for comparison purposes.
Methods: We pooled data on 229 uterine sarcomas, 244 MMMTs, 7623 EEC cases, and 28 829 controls. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence
intervals (CIs) for risk factors associated with uterine sarcoma, MMMT, and EEC were estimated with polytomous logistic regression. We also
examined associations between epidemiological factors and histological subtypes of uterine sarcoma.
Results: Significant risk factors for uterine sarcoma included obesity (body mass index (BMI)X30 vs BMIo25 kg m 2 (OR: 1.73, 95% CI: 1.22–2.46),
P-trend ¼ 0.008) and history of diabetes (OR: 2.33, 95% CI: 1.41–3.83). Older age at menarche was inversely associated with uterine sarcoma risk
(X15 years vs o11 years (OR: 0.70, 95% CI: 0.34–1.44), P-trend: 0.04). BMI was significantly, but less strongly related to uterine sarcomas compared
with EECs (OR: 3.03, 95% CI: 2.82–3.26) or MMMTs (OR: 2.25, 95% CI: 1.60–3.15, P-heterogeneity ¼ 0.01).
Conclusion: In the largest aetiological study of uterine sarcomas, associations between menstrual, hormonal, and anthropometric risk factors and
uterine sarcoma were similar to those identified for EEC. Further exploration of factors that might explain patterns of age- and race-specific
incidence rates for uterine sarcoma are needed.

Uterine sarcoma is a rare form of uterine cancer that arises from
the myometrium or connective tissue of the uterus and accounts
for 3–7% of all uterine cancer diagnoses in the United States
(D’Angelo and Prat, 2010). Unlike the most common uterine
cancer histological type, endometrioid endometrial carcinoma
(EEC), uterine sarcomas are highly aggressive, with 5-year overall
survival rates ranging between 17 and 55% (Prat, 2009). The peak
incidence of uterine sarcoma occurs at a younger age than EEC and
several studies reported higher incidence rates of uterine sarcoma
among Black compared with White women (Harlow et al, 1986;
Schwartz et al, 1996; Brooks et al, 2004), the opposite of overall
endometrial carcinoma trends (Sherman and Devesa, 2003).
Owing to the low incidence of this disease, the aetiology of
uterine sarcomas has been investigated in only a few small case–
control studies (Kvale et al, 1988; Schwartz and Thomas, 1989;
Schwartz and Weiss, 1990; Schwartz et al, 1991, 1996; Lavie et al,
2008; Jaakkola et al, 2011). Obesity, menopausal use of oestrogen
plus progestin, oral contraceptives (OC), and tamoxifen use are
associated with increased risks of uterine sarcoma, whereas
cigarette smoking and parity are associated with a reduced risk.
Recently, there was an important change in the classification of
uterine sarcoma; malignant mixed mullerian tumours (MMMTs),
which previously accounted for 40% of all uterine sarcomas, are
now classified as metaplastic endometrial carcinomas given their
similarities in aetiology and metastatic patterns (McCluggage,
2002; Prat, 2009). Consequently, previous risk factor associations
may have been affected by the inclusion of the MMMT subtype.
Here, we examine relationships between epidemiological risk
factors and uterine sarcoma, overall and by histological subtype, in
a large pooled analysis using the updated histological classification
for uterine sarcoma. Furthermore, we examine risk factor
associations for MMMTs and EECs to evaluate potential aetiologic
heterogeneity across a spectrum of uterine cancer diagnoses.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study population. The Epidemiology of Endometrial Cancer
Consortium (E2C2), sponsored in part by the National Cancer
Institute, was designed to combine data from cohort and case–
control studies to elucidate the aetiology of uterine cancer (Olson
et al, 2009). Any study that included at least one uterine sarcoma
case was eligible for the current analysis. The 10 cohort and five
case–control studies that contributed data to this analysis are
summarised in Table 1. For the cohort studies that contributed
data to E2C2 (other than the California Teachers Study (CTS)), a
nested case–control study design was employed, with inclusion of
up to four controls (women with an intact uterus and no uterine
cancer diagnosis) randomly selected from the risk set and matched
to the corresponding uterine cancer case on year of birth, date of
entry (within 6 months), and any additional matching criteria as
appropriate in the individual study. For the CTS, data came from a
previous nested case–control study in which two controls per case
were identified and matching was based on 5-year age group, race/
ethnicity, and broad geographic area within California. Cases in the
cohort studies were identified through annual linkage to state or
national cancer registries (Multiethnic Cohort Study, NIH-AARP
Diet and Health Study (NIH-AARP), Iowa Women’s Health Study
(IWHS), Netherlands Cohort Study (NLCS), Canadian National
Breast Screening Study (NBSS), and CTS) or by self-report on
follow-up questionnaires and confirmed through medical record
review, linkage to cancer registries, or the National Death Index
(Cancer Prevention Study II Nutrition Cohort, Breast Cancer
Detection Demonstration Project (BCDDP), Nurses’ Health Study
(NHS), and Black Women’s Health Study (BWHS)).
In the case–control studies, population-based controls were
frequency-matched to cases except in the US Case–Control Study
(US) where individual 1 : 1 matching was employed. Eligible
controls were those women with an intact uterus and no history of
uterine cancer. Methods to select controls within each source
population included random digit dialling (US, Bay Area Womens
Health Study (BAWHS), Endometrial Cancer and Physical Activity
Study (ECPA)) and random selection from data registrars of all
citizens (Polish Endometrial Cancer Study (PECS) and Shanghai
Endometrial Cancer Study (SECS)). All studies were approved by
the institutional review boards (IRBs) of their parent institutions,
and written informed consent was obtained from all participants.
In addition, Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Centre has IRB
approval as the data coordinating centre for E2C2.
Data collection. De-identified data from the participating studies
were centrally collected and harmonised at Memorial Sloan–
Kettering Cancer Centre. We made an effort to collect a core set of
standardized variables, but not all variables were collected by each
study. Some studies did not provide information on menopausal
oestrogen plus progestin use (NBSS, ECPA, NLCS, IWHS,
BCDDP), menopausal oestrogen-alone use (NBSS, ECPA, IWHS),
diabetes (BAWHS and NBSS), parity (NLCS), or smoking status
(BAWHS). As the number of live births was not reported by the
NLCS, we used the number of pregnancies lasting X7 months as a
surrogate for parity among NLCS cases and controls.
Case definitions. Women with an incident, histologically con￾firmed diagnosis of uterine sarcoma, MMMT, or EEC were
included as case patients in the current study. Although the
emphasis of this study is on uterine sarcomas, women with
MMMTs or EECs were included for comparison purposes. Uterine
sarcoma cases with the following International Classification of
Diseases for Oncology (ICD)-O-3 morphology codes were
included: sarcoma, not otherwise specified (NOS) 8800–8806,
fibromatous neoplasms 8810–8815, myomatous neoplasms 8890–
8896 (includes leiomyosarcoma), rhabdomyosarcoma 8900–8902,
embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma 8910–8912, and endometrial
stromal sarcoma 8930–8934. Four studies (PECS, SECS, BWHS,
and NHS) did not have ICD-O-3 codes and instead supplied a
summary histology variable for each case (i.e., sarcoma, EEC,
MMMT, etc). The ICD-O-3 codes 8950–8982 or summary
variable ‘MMMT’ were used to define MMMT, while
ICD-O-3 codes 8380–8383 and summary variable ‘endometrioid’
identified EECs. EEC cases from the NHS could not be
distinguished from adenocarcinoma, NOS cases and were excluded
from analysis.
Statistical methods. Categories for exposure variables were
created including age (p54, 55–59, 60–64, 65–69, X70 years),
race (White, Black, Asian, other), BMI (o25, 25–30,
X30 kg m 2
), age at menarche (o11, 11–12, 13–14, X15 years),
menopausal status (premenopausal, peri-menopausal, postmeno￾pausal), parity (no live births, 1 or more live births), number of live
births among parous women (1, 2, 3–4, X5 live births), smoking
status (never, former, current), menopausal hormone use (never,
ever), menopausal oestrogen use (never, ever), menopausal
oestrogen plus progestin use (never, ever), OC use (never, ever),
and history of diabetes (no, yes). Given the importance of these
variables in the aetiology of common endometrial carcinoma
subtypes, we included all exposure variables simultaneously in an
unconditional polytomous logistic regression model to estimate the
magnitude of association (odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence
intervals (CIs)) between risk factors and case groups. Polytomous
logistic regression was used when the outcome variable is nominal
with more than two levels (Hosmer, 2000). When a study did not
report values for a particular variable, that study was excluded
from the specific risk factor analysis. Missing values were coded as
a separate category for each variable; when excluding subjects with
missing values the results did not appreciably change.

All models were adjusted for age and race; however, we do not
present effect estimates for these variables given their use as
matching criteria in all studies. Tests for linear trend were
performed for BMI, age at menarche, and number of live births
among parous women by including the ordinal form of each
variable in the model. We also examined risk factors for
endometrial stromal sarcoma and leiomyosarcoma, the two main
histological subtypes of uterine sarcoma, compared with controls.
Differences in ORs between case groups were quantified using
case-only logistic regression models. A P-heterogeneity o0.05
indicated the magnitude of effect for a particular risk factor was
significantly different between case groups. Between-study
heterogeneity of effect estimates was examined by creating a
multiplicative interaction term between study site (fixed effect
covariate) and each risk factor and performing a likelihood ratio
test comparing models with and without the risk factor-study site
interaction terms.
Using the distribution of risk factors in our sample, a binary
outcome (control vs uterine sarcoma), power of 80% and
a two-sided a of 0.05, we calculated minimum detectable ORs for
each risk factor, which ranged from 1.45–1.89 for factors associated
with increased risk and 0.35–0.67 for protective factors. All tests of
statistical significance were two-sided. Analyses were performed
using SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).

RESULTS
A total of 229 uterine sarcomas, 244 MMMTs, 7623 EECs, and
28 829 controls were available for this pooled analysis. Black race
was more prevalent among MMMTs compared with uterine
sarcoma and EEC cases (17.2%, 11.3%, and 2.6%, respectively, data
not tabled), and median age at diagnosis was oldest among
MMMT cases compared with uterine sarcoma and EEC cases
(67.0, 61.4, and 64.3 years, respectively, data not tabled).
Distributions of risk factors, ORs, and 95% CIs are shown in
Table 2. Significantly increased risk of uterine sarcoma was
observed for obese compared to normal BMI (OR: 1.73, 95% CI:
1.22–2.46) and a history of diabetes compared with no diabetes
(OR: 2.33, 95% CI: 1.41–3.83), whereas older age at menarche (age
at menarche X15 compared with age at menarche o11 years OR:
0.70, 95% CI: 0.34–1.44, p-trend ¼ 0.04) was associated with a
lower risk of uterine sarcoma. Any live births, postmenopausal
status, OC use, and current or former smoking were inversely but
not statistically significantly associated with uterine sarcoma risk.
BMI was significantly, but less strongly related to uterine sarcoma
than to EECs (OR: 3.03, 95% CI: 2.82–3.26) or MMMTs (OR: 2.25,
95% CI: 1.60–3.15) for the heaviest compared with the leanest
women (P-heterogeneity ¼ 0.01).
In exploratory analyses, we examined risks associated with the
most prevalent histological subtypes of uterine sarcoma: endome￾trial stromal sarcoma (n ¼ 98) and leiomyosarcoma (n ¼ 82)
(Table 3). Black race was more prevalent among leiomyosarcoma
compared with endometrial stromal sarcoma cases (20.7% vs 6.1%,
data not tabled), whereas median age at diagnosis was similar (61.8
and 63.6 years, respectively, data not tabled). The direction of most
associations for the histological subtypes was similar to patterns
observed for uterine sarcoma overall. Obesity (OR: 1.74, 95% CI:
1.03–2.93) and a history of diabetes (OR: 2.28, 95% CI: 1.02–5.12)
were associated with significantly higher risks of endometrial
stromal sarcoma, whereas reduced risk of leiomyosarcoma was
observed for postmenopausal compared with premenopausal
women (OR: 0.35, 95% CI: 0.16–0.75). Compared with the overall
associations, less consistency in histological subtype associations
was noted for age at menarche and former or current smoking.
However, no significant heterogeneity of effects between these two
histological subtypes was observed (P-heterogeneity 40.10).
DISCUSSION
The present pooled analysis examined the association between
previously identified endometrial carcinoma risk factors—
including reproductive, hormonal, and anthropometric factors—
and uterine sarcoma, a rare yet fatal uterine cancer subtype. Our
data suggest that uterine sarcoma shares certain risk factors with
EECs but less so with MMMTs. Similar to EEC, obesity and history
of diabetes were linked with an increased risk of uterine sarcoma,
while older age at menarche was associated with decreased risk.
Subtype analyses of endometrial stromal sarcoma and leiomyo￾sarcoma generally revealed risk factor associations similar to those
observed for all uterine sarcomas combined.
Uterine sarcomas fall under the broad category of soft tissue
sarcomas, which are extremely rare regardless of the site of origin.
Previously documented risk factors for this heterogeneous group of
tumours include ionising radiation, exposure to certain chemicals,
and genetic syndromes, such as neurofibromatosis type 1 and
Li-Fraumeni syndrome (Skubitz and D’Adamo, 2007). Uterine
sarcomas have been particularly difficult to examine owing to changes
in classification over time, histological diversity, and low incidence
rates. In 2009, the International Federation of Gynaecology and
Obstetrics reclassified MMMTs, which at the time was the most
common uterine sarcoma histology subtype (40%), as a metaplastic
endometrial carcinoma. Moreover, the remaining uterine sarcoma
subtypes—leiomyosarcoma, endometrial stromal sarcoma, adenosar￾coma, and undifferentiated sarcoma—are a heterogeneous group,
which complicates the study of their aetiology. The two most common
subtypes now, leiomyosarcoma and endometrial stromal sarcoma, can
be distinguished by their sarcomatous appearance during histology
examination. However, expert pathologists are needed for the correct
classification of these subtypes (Chu et al, 2001).
Our results support findings from some previous studies on risk
factors for specific histological subtypes of uterine sarcoma. In a
case–control study (167 cases, 208 controls), Schwartz et al (1991,
1996) reported on uterine sarcoma subtype risks associated with
exogenous hormone use, obesity, smoking, and menstrual and
reproductive characteristics. As in our study, high BMI was
associated with increased risks of endometrial stromal sarcoma
(n ¼ 26), while the risk of leiomyosarcoma (n ¼ 56) was lower
among cigarette smokers than never smokers. Although we
observed inverse associations with current smoking status for
uterine sarcoma overall (OR: 0.88) and for leiomyosarcoma (OR:
0.75), these associations did not achieve statistical significance.
Prior reports also suggest decreased uterine sarcoma risk associated
with older age at menarche (Kvale et al, 1988; Schwartz et al, 1991),
which was apparent in our study for uterine sarcoma risk overall
and of the endometrial stromal sarcoma subtype. Parity was
associated with decreased uterine sarcoma risk in a prior study
(Kvale et al, 1988); however, our results concur with two other
reports that did not observe clear associations with any live births,
the number of live births, and uterine sarcoma risk (Schwartz and
Thomas, 1989; Schwartz et al, 1991).
In contrast to prior reports, we observed statistically non￾significant inverse associations between OC use and uterine sarcoma
risk overall, as well as risk of both histological subtypes, whereas
Schwartz et al. (1996) reported positive, albeit, statistically non￾significant associations. Given the absence of statistical significance
and information on the formulation and duration of OC use in ours
and the previous study, these findings should be interpreted
cautiously. Furthermore, we did not observe an association between
menopausal oestrogen plus progestin use and uterine sarcoma risk,
which has been observed previously. In a recent Finnish cohort study,
menopausal estradiol and progestin treatment was associated with
increased risks of leiomyosarcoma and endometrial stromal sarcoma,
especially among women with longer exposures (Jaakkola et al,
2011). Finally, the relationship between a history of diabetes and
uterine sarcoma risk has been explored in one previous study
(Brinton et al, 2005). Of 137 uterine sarcoma cases, only 2 had a
history of diabetes resulting in a null association. We noted strong
risks associated with a history of diabetes for uterine sarcoma overall
and both histological subtypes, which is consistent with aetiologic
studies of endometrial carcinoma (Weiderpass et al, 2000; Rosato
et al, 2011). Obesity and diabetes are associated with metabolic
disturbances and our finding of a stronger association with diabetes
for uterine sarcoma compared with EEC raises questions about the
possibility of a more central role of insulin in their aetiology.
Similarities in risk factor associations for uterine sarcoma and
EECs suggest overlap in the biological mechanisms associated with
development of these tumours. Commonly described mechanisms
relating menstrual, reproductive, and anthropometric factors to
EEC risk include imbalances in multiple pathways, including sex
hormones (oestrogen and progesterone), insulin and insulin-like
growth factors (IGFs), and inflammatory markers such as
interleukins. Higher expression of oestrogen, IGFs, and inter￾leukins is associated with increased risk of EECs (Calle and Kaaks,
2004; Oh et al, 2004; Dossus et al, 2010; Audet-Walsh et al, 2011;
Wang et al, 2011). Key cytogenetic and molecular events observed
in endometrial stromal sarcomas include chromosomal rearrange￾ments, loss of heterozygosity of tumour suppressor genes, and

deregulation of the Wnt signalling pathway (Chiang and Oliva,
2011), while leiomyosarcomas are characterised by chromosome 1
deletion. The relationship between aetiologic risk factors and these
molecular data is lacking, but this information would allow for a
better understanding of uterine sarcoma tumour biology.
Our pooled analysis has several strengths, including the largest
sample size of uterine sarcomas examined in the literature to date
and availability of data on important risk factors and confounders.
Several limitations of the current analysis should be noted.
Although our sample size was large relative to previous studies,
the histological subtype analyses were affected by small numbers as
evidenced by large CIs. The ascertainment of exposure variables
differed across studies, potentially introducing misclassification
bias. Because of these differences, some variables were classified
using crude categories to harmonise across studies. Importantly,
we did not observe between-study statistical heterogeneity
for any variable under consideration. We had insufficient data
from the studies in the pooled analysis on other risk factors of
interest, including infertility history, tamoxifen use, history of
uterine fibroids, and previous cancer diagnoses. Other novel risk
factors, including occupational exposures (Koivisto-Korander et al,
2012) and in vitro fertilisation (Venn et al, 2001), have been
examined infrequently and should be studied in appropriate
epidemiological settings. Disease misclassification is another
possible bias given the potential for differential diagnosis of
uterine cancer across diagnosis years, regions, and countries
represented by the individual studies. Although MMMTs have
recently been excluded from the uterine sarcoma classification, we
expect a small proportion of these tumours to be misclassified as
primary uterine sarcomas. Finally, this pooled analysis included
cases and controls from diverse geographic regions, potentially
introducing clinical heterogeneity in our study design. In
conclusion, we provide evidence of common aetiologic pathways
for EEC and uterine sarcoma. Further exploration of factors that
might explain patterns of age- and race-specific incidence rates for
uterine sarcoma are needed.
