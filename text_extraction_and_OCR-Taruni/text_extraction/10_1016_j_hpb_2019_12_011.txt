Abstract
Background: Optimal treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) beyond the Milan criteria (MC) is
debated. The aim of the study was to assess overall-survival (OS) and disease-free-survival (DFS) for
HCC beyond MC when treated by trans-arterial-chemoembolization (TACE) or surgical resection (SR).
Method: between 2005 and 2015, all patients with a first diagnosis of HCC beyond MC(1 nodule>5 cm,
or 3 nodules>3 cm without macrovascular invasion) were evaluated. Analyses were carried out through
Kaplan–Meier, Cox models and the inverse probability weighting (IPW) method to reduce allocation bias.
Sub-analyses have been performed for multinodular and single large tumors compared with a MC-IN
cohort.
Results: 226 consecutive patients were evaluated: 118 in SR group and 108 in TACE group. After IPW,
the two pseudo-populations were comparable for tumor burden and liver function. In the SR group, 1–5
years OS rates were 72.3% and 35% respectively and 92.7% and 39.3% for TACE (p = 0.500). The
median DFS was 8 months (95%CI:8–9) for TACE, and 11 months (95%CI:9–12) for SR (p < 0.001).
TACE was an independent predictor for recurrence (HR 1.5; 95%CI: 1.1–2.1; p = 0.015). Solitary tumors
> 5 cm and multinodular disease had comparable OS and DFS as Milan-IN group (p > 0.05).
Conclusion: Surgery allowed a better control than TACE in patient bearing HCC beyond MC. This
translated into a significant benefit in terms of DFS but not OS.

Introduction
Patients bearing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and exceeding
the Milan criteria (MC)1 (single tumor < 5 cm or multinodular
disease up to 3 lesions, each < 3 cm in diameter) have a poor
long-term prognosis with a median survival of nearly 2 years
and a 5-year survival rate of 14–25%.2–4 Given for granted that
those patients received the best available treatment, this statistic
is significantly worse if compared with that of patients who are
fitting the MC.5,6 According to the 2018 guidelines for the
management of HCC by the European Association for the Study
of the Liver (EASL),7 MC-out patients, in the absence of
macrovascular invasion, belong prevalently to the intermediate
stage as per the BCLC staging system. The recommended gold￾standard management for this class was established to be the
trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE) of the tumor. How￾ever, there is a not negligible body of evidence8,9 suggesting that
This study was presented at the HCC Summit 2019 (Lisbon, 14–16
February 2019) and has been awarded the Young Investigator Award (full
bursary). Another oral presentation has been given during the 13th
congress of the European-African Hepato-pancreato-biliary association (E￾AHPBA) meeting 2019 (Amsterdam, 2–5 June 2019).

in selected patients, surgical resection (SR) can offer significant
survival benefits when compared with palliative treatments as
TACE. While within the MC the surgical approach is well
accepted, the real impact of curative rather than palliative
therapies beyond MC are still debated.The primary aim of our
study was to compare overall survival (OS) of patients treated
with SR or TACE for HCC beyond MC. Disease-free survival
(DFS) was the secondary endpoint. Given the predictable dif￾ference between the two groups we adopted the inverse prob￾ability weighting approach to minimize the potential selection
bias in analysing the association between treatments and out￾comes. Furthermore, to better understand the impact of sur￾gery, the surgical MC-Out cohort was compared with a cohort
of MC-In patients, in which the operation represents the
standard of care.
Methods
Study overview and treatments
This retrospective study evaluated patient data collected pro￾spectively in two Italian centers (ASST - San Gerardo Hospital,
Monza, and ASST - Grande Ospedale Metropolitano Niguarda,
Milan) and anonymized prior to the retrospective analysis. The
study protocol followed the ethical guidelines of the 1975
Declaration of Helsinki (as revised in Brazil 2013). The local
Ethical Committee review of the protocol deemed that formal
approval was not required owing to the retrospective, observa￾tional and anonymous nature of this study. Results are reported
according to principles of Strengthening the Reporting of
Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE).11 Data
collection was performed using an electronic database system in
both centers. The submitted data were then checked centrally, at
San Gerardo Hospital and, when missing data were identified,
the local investigator was contacted and asked to complete the
records. Once examined, the record was accepted into the dataset
for analysis.
Details on the surgical technique have been previously
described.12,13 TACE was performed as follows: a vascular cath￾eter was inserted through the femoral artery using the Seldinger
technique to the hepatic artery, and hepatic angiography was
carried out. Hepatic arteriography was performed to identify the
feeding artery of the liver tumor. The catheter, usually a 4F or 5F
RH catheter (either Simmons [Cook, Bloomington, Ind] or
Cobra [Terumo Medical, Somerset, NJ] catheters were used) was
inserted into the tumor feeding artery as close as possible to the
tumor. Microcatheters (Progreat, Terumo Co, Kanagawa, Japan)
were used to catheterize in a superselective way the feeding artery
if needed. Once the operator selected the final catheter position
for TACE, intra-arterial chemotherapy was performed by injec￾tion of 10–12 mL of iodized oil (Lipiodol Ultra Fluide; Labo￾ratoire Guerbet, Roissy, France) mixed with an emulsion of
50 mg of doxorubicin hydrochloride into the feeding artery.
Embolization was performed by means of a mixture of iobitridol
(Xenetix 350; Guerbet, Aulnay, France) and 1-mm-diameter
absorbable gelatin sponge particles (Spongostan; Ferrosan,
Søborg, Denmark). The regimen of chemoembolization was
adjusted according to liver function and peripheral leukocyte or
platelet levels. Gelatin was administered afterward for additional
embolization. The radiologic response was evaluated 4–6 weeks
thereafter by contrast-enhanced multidetector computed to￾mography or magnetic resonance.
Patient selection and study design
All consecutive adult patients (age  18 years) with histologically
or radiologically proven HCC who underwent SR or TACE at the
two institutions from January 2005 to December 2015 were
evaluated for this study. Inclusion criteria were: (i) first diagnosis
of HCC without any previous disease treatment; (ii) Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 or
1. Exclusion criteria were (i) macrovascular tumor invasion; (ii)
Child-Pugh class C; (iii) patients on a waiting list for trans￾plantation or receiving any bridge treatment to transplant. Pa￾tients were then divided according to MC criteria (IN or OUT).
Finally, patients were analysed according to the treatment allo￾cation: SR or TACE.
The indication to surgery or TACE was assessed during multi￾disciplinary meetings involving surgeons, hepatologists, oncol￾ogists, radiologists, interventional radiologists, infectiologists.
Patient-tailored treatment allocation was based on patient
comorbidities, previous abdominal operations, underlying liver
damage and presence of bilobar disease.
The primary analysis encompassed MC-Out patients who
underwent surgery or TACE.
In a secondary analysis, we compared MC-out patients with a
reference group (MC-in) in which surgery is the recognized
standard of care. This was done to better understand whether
surgery may be considered an acceptable treatment option also in
MC-out. We further stratify this cohort in single large tumors
(SR-SN) and multinodular tumors (SR-MN), and we compared
these subgroups with MC-IN patients with similar characteris￾tics. The decision flow chart summarizing the different group
comparisons is depicted in Fig. 1.
Outcomes
The primary endpoint was to compare the overall-survival (OS)
in patients undergoing surgery or TACE in a MC-OUT cohort.
The secondary endpoint was disease-free-survival (DFS). Risk
factors for OS and DFS were also evaluated.
As a subgroup analysis, we also evaluated the survival outcomes
of surgery and TACE in patients stratified as per the Bolondi et al.

Variables
Age, sex, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) perfor￾mance status14 and liver function at presentation were recorded
and evaluated at the first visit. In particular, the presence of
cirrhosis and its severity was evaluated by expert hepatologists
during the disease work-up. BCLC grade was estimated after
radiological evaluation. Model for end-stage liver disease (MELD)
score, Child-Pugh score, were calculated on the basis of preop￾erative serum biochemical values and clinical examination. Serum
alpha-fetoprotein (a-FP) was also part of preoperative evaluation.
The number and diameter of nodules were assessed through
preoperative radiologic imaging and confirmed by intraoperative
ultrasound.
Follow-up
All patients were followed using a local protocol including
measurement of serum a-fetoprotein, abdominal ultrasound,
contrast computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI), and office visits as previously described.15
Briefly, each patient was followed up every 3 months for the
first two years and then every six months. OS was defined as the
time interval in months from surgery or first TACE to death; if
alive, patient data were censored at the last visit available. DFS
was defined as the time interval in months from surgery or TACE
to recurrence or death. In case of no recurrence or death, data
were censored at the date of the last available follow-up. Patient
surveillance was closed at the end of March 2018.

Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics are expressed as median and interquartile
range (IQR) for continuous variables and as number and pro￾portion for categorical variables. The distribution of baseline
factors was compared between treatments (SR vs. TACE) using
Mann–Whitney or Fisher test as appropriate. The probability of
OS over time was estimated using the Kaplan–Meier method.
Stratified curves and the log-rank test were used to evaluate the
association of prognostic factors with OS. Moreover, uni- and
multivariate Cox regression models were fitted to the data on
factual population. The inverse probability weighting (IPW)
approach was applied to minimize potential selection bias in
analysing the association between treatment and OS, as follows:
logistic regression was carried out to estimate the probability of
receiving SR of TACE depending on patient and tumor charac￾teristics. These were chosen among factors associated to both
treatment and OS at the univariate analysis or based on clinical
knowledge. Subsequently, the outcome of each patient was
weighted by the inverse of the probability of the treatment
actually received creating a pseudo-population of doubled size
that resembles the counterfactual situation were all patients
receive both treatments. In the weighted sample, measured
confounders should be balanced between treatment groups. As a
consequence, the standardized difference between groups of all
variables included in the predictive model for treatment was
negligible on the weighted sample compared to the standardized
difference on the original sample. Finally, treatment-specific
Kaplan–Meier curves of OS were estimated on the weighted
sample data. Analogous analyses were performed on the DFS
end-point. All statistical tests were two tailed and a 5% signifi￾cance level was considered. All the analysis was carried out using
R software version 3.5.1.
Results
From 2005 to 2015, 609 patients were evaluated during multi￾disciplinary meetings. Of them, 226 patients were outside the
MC, while 233 were classified as within MC. The other 150 were
excluded according to the criteria of the study. Within the cohort
of MC-out patients, 118 received SR and 108 TACE. All patients
in the MC-IN group underwent surgical resection.
SR and TACE in the MC-out cohort were different for several
variables at univariate analysis: surgical group was more
frequently female (26.3% vs 14.8%, p:0.048) and with a minor
incidence of diabetes (20.3% vs 35.4%, p: 0.023). Moreover, the
TACE group had an higher rate of cirrhotic patients (90.7% vs.
74.6% in surgery group, p = 0.002), a higher median MELD
score (9 [IQR 8–11] versus 8 [6–10], p < 0.001), a median INR
(1.17 [IQR 1.08–1.25] vs. 1.08 [IQR 1.00–1.18]), a higher fre￾quency of HCV infections (61.1% vs 38.1%, p: 0.001) and also
had a higher median number of nodules (3 [IQR 2–4] versus 1
[IQR 1–2] than in the surgery group, p < 0.001). Moreover, the
TACE group had a higher rate of bilobar disease (46.7% vs
19.3%, p < 0.001). Conversely, the surgery group had an higher
rate of tumors > 5 cm (72.9% vs 27.4% in the TACE group,
p < 0.001). Data are summarized in Table 1.
To understand the impact of each significantly different vari￾ables on survival and treatment allocation, we performed a Cox
univariate regression. Part of these variables, which may be
associated to the tumor burden as well as estimators of worse
underlying liver damage, where identified as factors with

increased risk of selection bias. The IPW method was used to
weight the following confounders: presence of cirrhosis, MELD
score, bilirubin, INR, number of nodules >1, tumor size > 5 cm.
By this statistical approach we obtained two pseudo-populations
(210.62 and 204.87 patients for SR and TACE respectively) with a
reasonable certainty to compare the treatment effect on survival
without being affected by liver or tumor related differences at the
baseline, as measured by the reduction of the standard difference
before and after weighting (Table 2). Supplementary Fig. 1(a and
b) shows the distribution of the probabilities of TACE estimated
by the logistic regression model and the distribution of the in￾verse probability of treatment weights, respectively, in the two
factual treatment groups. The mean of the weights was close to
ideal value 2 (1.84 and 2.15 in the surgery and TACE group,
respectively).
Among the observed population, the median OS was 42
months (95%CI: 28–64) and 34 months (95%CI: 27–41) for SR
and TACE respectively (p = 0.200). The median DFS for SR was
12 months (95%CI: 9–17) and 8 months (95%CI: 8–9) for
TACE (p < 0.001). After IPW the results were similar. In the SR
group, 1-3-5 year OS rates were 72.3%, 46.7% and 35%
respectively and 92.7%, 59.4% and 39.3% for TACE (log-rank
test = 0.500). In terms of DFS, 1-3-5 year survival rates were
44%, 19.8% and 15.3% for SR and 36.5%, 0.5% and 0.2% for
TACE respectively (p < 0.001). Kaplan–Meier survival curves
before and after IPW are depicted in Fig. 2.
Prognostic factors for OS and DFS
Table 3 shows the estimates of uni- and multivariate Cox models,
fitted on factual population, to evaluate the impact of potential
risk factors on mortality and recurrence. According to the results
of the adjusted analysis, Child-B (HR 2.219; 95%CI: 1.379; 3.572;
p = 0.001) and age (HR per one-year increase 1.172; 95%CI:
1.000; 1.373; p = 0.050) were significant predictors of OS. A poor
liver function, (Child-B) (HR 1.822; 95%CI: 1.182; 2.808;
p = 0.007), and TACE treatment (HR 1.535; 95%CI: 1.085; 2.171;
p = 0.015) were significant predictors of worse DFS.
Surgery versus TACE after stratification according to
the Bolondi classification
Survival curves stratified by the Bolondi et al. classification are
depicted in Supplementary figure 2. B1 patients had a median OS
of 32 months (95%CI: 27–43) after surgery and a median of 43
months (95%CI: 41–70) after TACE (log-rank test p = 0.70).
The median OS for B2 was 39 months (95%CI: 27–54) and 34
months (95%CI: 25–41) for SR and TACE respectively
(p = 0.30); while it was 25 months (95%CI: 9–43) for SR and 30
months (95%CI: 21–50) for TACE within B3-4 group. The
median DFS was significantly different in the B1 subgroup: 13
months (95%CI: 8–17) for SR and 11 months (95%CI: 9–13)
for TACE (p < 0.001). The B2 and B3-4 patients showed no
significant difference between groups for DFS.
Secondary analysis: single HCC > 5 cm versus MC-IN
tumors
To better understand the impact of surgery in the MC-Out cohort,
we analysed as a secondary analysis, the OS by comparing MC￾Out patients with MC-In patients in which surgery is the stan￾dard treatment. The baseline characteristics of the two cohorts are
summarized in the Supplementary table 1. Seventy-four patients
beyond MC had single nodule larger than 5 cm in size. Of them, 64
were treated by surgery (SR-SN). The median OS for SR-SN was
50.6 months (95%CI: 19.9–81.3), while it was 61.8 months (95%
CI: 48.2–75.1) for the MC-IN group. At log-rank test, survival
time was comparable between SR-SN and MC-IN group
(p = 0.190). The median DFS was 18.8 months (95%CI:
10.3–27.3), 22.7 months (95%CI: 26.7–28.5) for SR-SN and MC￾IN respectively. At comparison, SR-SN survival was similar to
MC-IN (p = 0.954). Comparisons are depicted in Fig. 3.
Secondary analysis: multinodular HCC beyond MC
versus MC-IN tumors
One-hundred and fifty patients had a multinodular disease
beyond MC (>1 nodule >3 cm in size). Of them, 53 received
surgery (SR-MN). They were first compared with the MC-IN

group (n = 238). The median OS for SR-MN was 34.3 months
(95%CI: 21.3–47.3) and 62 months (95%CI: 49.5–74.4) for
MC-IN group. Significant differences were found between SR￾MN versus MC-IN (p = 0.001). Surgically resected patients
and beyond MC had a median DFS of 8.2 months (95%CI: 4.4-
1.02), while MC-IN patients had a median DFS of 23.0 months
(95%CI: 17.9–28.1; p < 0.001).
The SR-MN group was compared with the multinodular MC￾IN proportion (MC-IN-MN; 2–3 nodules less than 3 cm without
macrovascular invasion, n = 39). The median number of nodules
for SR-MN was 2 (IQR: 2–3) with a median size of 5 cm (IQR:
4–6). The median number of nodules for MC-IN-MN was 2
(IQR: 2-2) with a median size of 2.2 cm (IQR 1.7–2.6). The
median OS was 34.3 months (95%CI: 21.3–47.3) and 51.8
months (95%CI: 39.4–64.2) for SR-MN and MC-IN-MN
respectively (p = 0.072). The median DFS was 8.2 months
(95%CI: 4.4–12) for SR-MN and 18.2 months (95%CI: 3.3–33)
for MC-IN-MN (p = 0.111). Comparison and overall results are
depicted in Fig. 3.
Discussion
The present findings suggest that, in patients suffering from HCC
beyond MC, the rate and median long-term survival were not
significantly different between the two treatments, while a poten￾tially more radical approach to the disease, such as the surgical
resection, offers, in selected patients, some benefits in terms of
disease-free survival when compared to chemoembolization.

As expected, the two treatment groups were not comparable
for baseline characteristics. In particular, patients receiving TACE
had more frequently a bilobar disease, a more deteriorated un￾derling liver function, a multinodular presentation, and smaller
nodules than patients who received surgery. In contrast, this
latter group had a slide, but significant, poorer performance
status and a higher rate of comorbid conditions. Overall, our
treatment allocation mirrored other reports available in litera￾ture,2,16 and it represents an evident confounder in the
endeavour of comparing the two treatments for patients outside
the Milan criteria. Noteworthy insights on the optimal approach
for this cohort can be obtained only by randomized trials, but
statistical methods such as the inverse probability weighting can
lessen the role of confounders, as liver function and tumor
burden, on long-term outcomes. After weighting, the two
pseudo-populations were comparable for tumor burden and
underlying liver function, but the estimates of overall survival
rates did not substantially change. In addition, the results of the
multivariate analysis confirmed that the type of treatment did
not significantly affect the overall survival, but the underlying
liver function, as measured by the Child classification, was an
important variable in adjusting the risk of death. Therefore, we
may speculate that, in most of the cases, the tumor was not the
primary cause of decease even though we did not collect tumor￾specific survival data. Age was another risk factors for overall
survival. This result was somehow predictable since life expec￾tancy decreases with age progression but it may also reflect the
impact of age-related frailty in rescuing from long-term side
effects of therapies,17 since age-related decline in physiological
reserve and functional capacity are inevitable and may negatively
affect cure tolerance. The present results endorse previous
memorandum on the key role of ageing in determining treat￾ment long-term outcomes18,19 and should motivate a more
careful selection among elderly subjects.
Despite our findings are consistent with some reports,20 and
dissimilar from others in terms of overall survival,21–25 the
appraisal is challenging to achieve because of the different clas￾sification systems used. All the above publications used the BCLC
staging system and compared the effect of treatments in patients
classified as intermediate stage B which suffers high heteroge￾neity.10 Moreover, high inconsistency in outcome mea￾sures22,26–28 were reported when different managements were
compared for the cure of single large tumors (>5 cm) or
multinodular disease at presentation. Single large tumors are
considered a borderline population, with conflicting results on
prognosis. This observation induced to classify these patients as
at intermediate stage,29 or at least between early and intermediate
stage (AB stage).30 The present results fully support the latest
EASL recommendation7 stating that surgical resection is an
appropriate option for single HCC of any size when hepatic
function is preserved, and sufficient remnant liver volume is
guaranteed postoperatively. In fact, we observed a similar median
survival when the SR group with a single large tumor beyond the
Milan criteria was compared to the early-stage (MC-IN) group.

However, it should be acknowledged that the criteria for a safe
operation (technical or general health conditions) may suffer
from subjective judgement and local policies.
By analysing the population with multinodular disease, we
observed that the surgical group, as compared with the early
stage group (MC-IN), had a significant poorer median survival..
However, when surgical patients beyond MC and having a
multinodular disease were compared with patients having a
multinodular disease and classified as Milan-IN (2–3 nodules
less than 3 cm in size), there was no significant difference in
terms of survival. A RCT4 investigating the role of surgery versus
chemo-embolization, showed a survival benefit in patients who
underwent surgery for multinodular HCC beyond MC. Our
results are in line, since surgery allows a comparable survival rate
with a reference population (MC-In patients) in which surgery is
the standard of care. According to these results, surgery might be
reconsidered as a treatment option also in multinodular disease
and in cases of MC-out patients. However, these results should
be considered with caution for the risk of type II error due to the
small number of patients.
To better stratify diseases with a more aggressive behaviour
from the ones with favourable prognosis, Bolondi et al.10 pro￾posed a sub-classification that takes into account the tumor
burden along with the underlying liver function. By adopting this
proposal, we found that surgery provided significant benefits in
terms of disease-free survival over TACE but only for patients
belonging to the B1 cluster. This subgroup comprises patients
with high tumor burden but adequate liver function. The
advantage of surgical resection may be due to the risk reduction
of local and metastatic relapse but also to the lower risk of de￾novo recurrence associated to advance liver dysfunction.
In general, the present findings suggest that surgical resection
offered a significant benefit on disease-free survival. This gain was
seen in both the observed and weighted cohorts. When an oper￾ation is feasible, liver resection appeared to guarantee a better
disease control than TACE, even in neoplasm with more aggressive
features than the tumors which are considered in an early stage
presentation. In fact, our results showed that chemoembolization
doubles the risk of tumor relapse than surgery, probably because
of the reduced ability to control the intra-hepatic disease extension
and so increasing the risk of metastatic recurrence.
Disease-free survival is an end-point for an increasing number
of clinical studies of cancer treatment and can be considered both
as a surrogate end-point and as an end-point in itself.31 The
period of time without relapse directly translates into more time
that patients experience without cancer and cancer directed
therapy. If a treatment would not make a person live any longer
overall, but would make him live longer without documented
disease, this may be an intrinsic added value of a treatment on
quality of life. Moreover, disease relapse carries considerable
health-associated and social costs for the time and medical re￾sources required for recurrence treatments.
Several study limitations should be acknowledged. The major
drawback is treatment allocation. This was an inevitable conse￾quence of a subjective clinical decision based on tumor and
patient characteristics. To limit this intrinsic bias of all retro￾spective studies, we adopted the inverse probability weighting
approach to minimize the potential selection bias in analysing
the association between treatments and outcomes. Second,
excessive subgrouping could have produced type-II errors
generating unreliable results. Third, tumor-specific survival
could have been a more appropriate outcome measure to weigh
the effect of treatments.

Conclusion
Surgical resection allowed a better control than TACE in patient
bearing HCC beyond MC without macrovascular invasion. This
translated into a significant benefit in terms of disease-free sur￾vival but not overall survival. Underlying liver function seemed
the more important risk factor affecting overall survival. When
the aggressiveness of an HCC is evaluated according to the tumor
burden (as per the MC criteria), surgical resection is an appro￾priate option for single HCC of any size when hepatic function is
preserved, while additional research is needed to address the best
therapeutic options for multinodular disease exceeding the MC
criteria, because the actual guideline indication may not be the
best option for these patients.
