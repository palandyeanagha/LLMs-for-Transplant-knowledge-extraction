Rituximab therapy in nephrotic syndrome: 
implications for patients’ management
Aditi Sinha and Arvind Bagga
Abstract | Rituximab offers an alternative to current immunosuppressive therapies for difficult-to-treat 
nephrotic syndrome. The best outcomes are seen in patients with steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome 
who have failed to respond to multiple therapies. By contrast, the benefits of rituximab therapy are limited in 
patients with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome, particularly those with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis 
(FSGS). Therapy with plasma exchange and one or two doses of rituximab has shown success in patients with 
recurrent FSGS. Young patients and those with normal serum albumin at recurrence of nephrotic syndrome 
are most likely to respond to rituximab therapy. A substantial proportion of rituximab-treated patients with 
idiopathic membranous nephropathy show complete or partial remission of proteinuria, and reduced levels 
of phospholipase A2 receptor autoantibodies, which are implicated in the pathogenesis of this disorder. 
Successful rituximab therapy induces prolonged remission and enables discontinuation of other medications 
without substantially increasing the risk of infections and other serious adverse events. However, the available 
evidence of efficacy of rituximab therapy is derived chiefly from small case series and requires confirmation in 
prospective, randomized, controlled studies that define the indications for use and predictors of response to 
this therapy.

Introduction
Rituximab is a chimaeric monoclonal antibody against 
CD20, an antigen expressed during most stages of B‑cell 
development. Binding of rituximab to CD20 causes rapid 
depletion of B‑cell populations and has been used for 
the treatment of a number of autoimmune disorders.1
This agent is approved for therapy in non-Hodgkin lym‑
phoma, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, vasculitis and 
rheumatoid arthritis.2,3 In addition, rituximab has been 
tested in clinical trials for the treatment of systemic lupus 
erythematosus, and is used off-label for post-­transplant 
lymphoproliferative disease.2
 Rituximab has also 
been used in the treatment of patients with nephrotic 
syndrome, including those with steroid-dependent 
nephrotic syndrome or steroid-resistant nephrotic syn‑
drome, recurrent focal segmental glomerulosclerosis 
(FSGS) and membranous nephropathy (Box 1).4–7
This Review provides an overview of the available 
data on the safety and efficacy of rituximab in the treat‑
ment of paediatric and adult patients with nephrotic 
syndrome. Most reports are anecdotal or limited to 
case series, as limited data on the efficacy and safety of 
this treatment are available from prospective controlled 
trials. Owing to the retrospective nature of these reports, 
the indications for rituximab administration to patients 
are unclear and definitions of response are hetero￾geneous. Accordingly, we have reviewed studies on the 
efficacy of rituximab in patients with steroid-resistant 
nephrotic syndrome, recurrent FSGS or membranous 
nephropathy, in which achievement of complete or 
partial remission is reported on the basis of standard 
definitions, or by the authors of individual studies.8–10
For patients with steroid-­dependent nephrotic syn‑
drome, we have reviewed studies in which the frequency 
of relapses, the use of corticosteroids and other immuno￾suppressive agents and the need for re-treatment 
with rituximab was reported.
Mechanisms of action
CD20 is a calcium-channel protein expressed in B cells 
during maturation, in precursor B cells and mature 
B cells, but not in plasma cells.11 Although the function 
of CD20 is not clear, binding of rituximab or other anti￾CD20 monoclonal antibodies to this ligand in vitro acti‑
vates apoptosis via complement-dependent cytotoxicity 
and antibody-dependent cytotoxicity, which leads to 
rapid depletion of B cells.11,12 After binding to rituximab, 
CD20 is translocated into lipid rafts, where signalling 
through tyrosine kinases, mitogen-activated protein 
kinases and phospholipase Cγ mediates inhibition 
of B‑cell growth or leads to apoptosis.12–14
The mechanisms by which rituximab induces remis‑
sion in patients with nephrotic syndrome are unclear 
(Figure 1). Proteinuria in patients with minimal change 
disease and FSGS might be mediated by unrecognized 
permeability factor(s), perhaps a T‑cell cytokine.15 Since 
B cells activate T‑helper cells through antigen presenta‑
tion, depletion of B cells might alter T‑cell function or

subpopulation expansion.16 Alternatively, the beneficial 
effects of rituximab therapy in patients with nephrotic 
syndrome might be mediated through restoration of 
T‑regulatory (TREG) cell populations and/or upregula‑
tion of their functions, similar to changes seen in patients 
with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, systemic 
lupus erythematosus and cryoglobulinaemic vascu‑
litis.17–22 Another study showed that the proportion of 
B‑regulatory (BREG) cells was increased during B‑cell 
recovery in mice with autoimmune diabetes when they 
were given rituximab. Rituximab therapy may there‑
fore induce TREG and BREG cell populations that restore 
immune tolerance.23
Several authors suggest that patients with nephrotic 
syndrome have deficient TREG cell function.24–28 In the 
‘two-hit’ hypothesis of minimal change disease, protein￾uria is initiated by podocyte expression of CD80, a 
T‑cell co-stimulatory molecule.29 Persistent protein￾uria might result from faulty cessation of CD80 expres‑
sion, owing to impaired podocyte autoregulation or 
impaired production of soluble CTLA4 by circulating 
TREG cells. After rituximab treatment, patients with 
membranous nephropathy have transiently increased 
numbers of CD3+ and CD4+ T cells, and a persistently 
increased number of natural killer cells, but no change 
in the number of TREG cells.30 However, two reports, cur‑
rently published as abstracts, indicate that therapy with 
rituximab produces an absolute or relative increase in the 
number of TREG cells.31,32
The rapidity with which rituximab reduces protein￾uria in patients with idiopathic or recurrent FSGS 
suggests that this treatment has direct actions on the 
podocyte (Figure 1). The CD20-binding region of 
rituximab crossreacts with an amino acid sequence 
within acid sphingomyelinase-like phosphodiesterase 3b 
(SMPDL3b).33 CD20 engagement by rituximab upregu‑
lates sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase (also known as 
acid sphingomyelinase) activity in B cells.34 The number 
of SMPDL3b+ podocytes was lower in patients who 
developed recurrent FSGS after renal transplantation 
than in those who did not.35 Normal human podocytes 
incubated with sera from patients with recurrent FSGS 
showed downregulation of SMPDL3b, the presence of 
actin stress fibres and disruption of the cytoskeleton. 
These findings were attenuated or reversed in the pres‑
ence of rituximab.35 Interestingly, in a podocyte model 
of HIV nephropathy, an altered actin cytoskeleton and 
diminished podocyte attachment were associated with 
decreased sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase activity.36
However, the role of this enzyme in the pathogenesis of 
FSGS requires confirmation in further studies.
Finally, patients with recurrent FSGS have high levels 
of soluble urokinase plasminogen activator surface 
receptor (uPAR) in serum.37 Experiments using trans‑
genic mice and podocyte cultures show that sera from 
such patients activates podocyte uPAR and integrin￾linked protein kinase, leading to foot process effacement, 
proteinuria and FSGS. Moreover, elevated serum levels 
of soluble uPAR are associated with a decrease in the 
number of TREG cells.38 The effect of rituximab on serum 
Key points
■ Therapy with rituximab induces and maintains remission effectively in 
patients with difficult-to-treat, steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome; 
sustained remission enables the reduction of steroid doses and withdrawal 
of calcineurin inhibitors
■ In patients with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome who fail to respond to 
treatment with calcineurin inhibitors, the response to rituximab therapy is 
less efficacious 
■ Rituximab dose(s), the rate of B‑cell recovery and clinical response are not 
closely correlated
■ Combined therapy with rituximab and plasma exchange might be useful to 
prevent or treat recurrence of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis
■ Therapy with rituximab should be considered in patients with idiopathic 
membranous nephropathy who fail to respond to treatment with 
cyclophosphamide or calcineurin inhibitors
■ Acute infusion reactions are frequent but transient in patients who receive 
rituximab; serious adverse effects, including an increased risk of infections, 
are uncommon

grin is being examined in patients with FSGS.39 These 
findings need confirmation in large studies and across 
different populations.
Determinants of treatment efficacy 
CD20 is internalized after binding to rituximab. 
Consequently, CD19 (another B‑cell surface antigen) 
is used as a marker for reliable monitoring of B-cell 
numbers in rituximab-treated patients.40 Pharmaco￾kinetic studies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis 
show that rituximab follows a two-compartment model 
with a terminal half-life of 19–22 days.41,42 The terminal

half-life of rituximab is 2.7-fold longer after the fourth 
dose than after the first dose.43 Patients given four 
doses of rituximab also have a twofold higher serum 
level and prolonged serum half-life of the medication 
compared with patients who received a single dose.44–46
Prospective studies in patients with nephrotic syn‑
drome show that one dose of rituximab results in pro‑
found B‑cell depletion (<1% of leukocytes, or 0–5 cells/
mm3
) in 83.3–90.0% of patients, and that B‑cell deple‑
tion lasts for 4–6 months after a single dose of rituxi‑
mab.44,47 However, the relationships between the number 
of doses of rituximab and time to B‑cell recovery, and 
between B‑cell recovery and the occurrence of relapse of 
nephrotic syndrome have not been established.48,49 After 
maximal B‑cell depletion, which occurs by 2 weeks after 
therapy with two doses of rituximab, B cells start to reap‑
pear from week 16 onwards.42 In one study, all 19 patients 
who responded to rituximab therapy were in remission 
during B‑cell depletion, and the patients who relapsed 
showed recovery of B cells to 3–7% of leukocytes.48
Although the above finding has been confirmed in other 
studies,44,47 an equally important observation is that some 
patients have sustained remission despite B‑cell recov‑
ery.44 In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, the timing 
of B‑cell recovery bears no relation to the recurrence of 
symptoms.42 Similarly, in a nationwide survey of rituxi‑
mab treatment for childhood-onset, difficult-­to-treat 
nephrotic syndrome conducted in Japan, the time to 
B‑cell recovery was similar in patients who relapsed 
compared with those in remission.50
The timing of re-treatment with rituximab is based 
on either the extent of B‑cell recovery or the occurrence 
of one or more relapses. In one study, doses of rituxi‑
mab were repeated in 12 of 19 patients who showed 
recovery of B cells after the initial clinical response.48
Others have used multiple courses of rituximab to 
achieve sustained B‑cell depletion for 15–18 months in 
patients with steroid-­dependent nephrotic syndrome.49,51
Prolonged B‑cell depletion was associated with sus‑
tained remission for 2 years in two-thirds of patients, 
despite B‑cell recovery, and without the use of additional 
immunosuppressive agents.51 Other research groups 
have successfully used re-treatment with rituximab to 
treat relapses.44,52,53
It is speculated that proteinuria in the nephrotic range 
might attenuate the biological effects of rituximab by 
causing increased urinary loss of the drug.48 Serum levels 
of rituximab were lower in patients with membranous 
nephropathy with substantial proteinuria than in those 
given rituximab during remission, or in patients with 
rheumatoid arthritis.30,45 Decreased efficacy of rituxi‑
mab in patients with proteinuria in the nephrotic range 
has been proposed in other studies,48,53 which suggests 
that rituximab should be administered during remission. 
Although reduction of proteinuria by maximal inhibition 
of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone axis might poten‑
tially reduce urinary losses of rituximab and increase its 
efficacy, this strategy requires prospective confirmation.
Most studies of patients with nephrotic syndrome 
have used a rituximab dose of 375 mg/m2
 once a week 
for 1–4 weeks, which is adapted from the standard 
regimen for lymphoma. Serum levels of rituximab are 
similar irrespective of whether it is administered to chil‑
dren or adults, and whether doses of 375mg/m2
 or 1g/m2
are used.45 Evidence from case series suggests that 
remission is prolonged after therapy with 2–4 doses of 
rituximab;52,54,55 therefore, we propose that patients with 
nephrotic syndrome should receive two or more doses of 
this agent. Prospective studies are, however, required to 
examine the relationship between the number of rituxi‑
mab doses and the chronology of B‑cell recovery, and 
how this relationship affects the clinical response.
Steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome
Approximately 40–60% of children with idiopathic 
nephrotic syndrome have frequent relapses or are 
dependent on steroid treatment.56 Although medications 
such as cyclophosphamide, levamisole and mycopheno‑
late mofetil reduce the frequency of relapses in most 
patients,57,58 the clinical management of some patients is 
difficult. Treatment with calcineurin inhibitors is effec‑
tive, but is associated with considerable toxic effects

syndrome. B‑cell depletion affects antigen presentation and activation of T cells 
through interaction with the T-cell receptor (circled in green), as well as inhibiting 
the production of cytokine(s) that might increase glomerular permeability. The role 
of rituximab in suppressing other permeability factors (for example, soluble uPAR, 
VEGF and ANGPTL4) is unclear. In an alternative model of minimal change disease, 
proteinuria is initiated by an increase in the expression of CD80 in podocytes. 
Production of CTLA4 by TREG cells, potentially enhanced by rituximab, might inhibit 
CD80 activation and reduce proteinuria. The role of BREG cells in mediating these 
effects is speculative. Finally, downregulation of SMPDL3b expression and loss of 
ASMase activity might lead to the formation of actin stress fibres, cytoskeletal 
disorganization and proteinuria, as shown in models of focal segmental 
glomerulosclerosis. Therapy with rituximab might reverse these changes.

such as nephrotoxicity, hyperglycaemia, headaches and 
dyslipidaemia.57–59 Therapies that enable steroid sparing 
without substantially increased adverse effects are, 
therefore, needed.
Rituximab was first reported to induce remission 
of nephrotic syndrome in a boy aged 16 years who 
was treated for co-existing idiopathic thrombocyto‑
penic purpura.60 Since then, other studies have shown 
the efficacy of this agent in patients with difficult-￾to-treat steroid-­dependent nephrotic syndrome 
(Table 1).44,47–55,61–63 Patients in these studies received 
rituximab as ‘rescue therapy’, several years after the onset 
of disease; previous therapies included three or more 
immunosuppressive agents in 30–100% of patients and 
calcineurin inhibitors in 42–100% of patients.
Clinical responses to therapy
Encouraging results have been reported for patients 
treated with rituximab for severe steroid-dependent or 
ciclosporin-dependent nephrotic syndrome. In a pro‑
spective, multicentre study, 19 of 22 patients treated with 
2–4 doses of rituximab had a satisfactory response 
with sustained remission and successful withdrawal 
of one or more immunosuppressive agents.48 Four 
patients (18.2%) relapsed at 7–17 months. A question‑

Nephrology Association (IPNA) provided data on 
28 patients given 1–4 doses of rituximab.54 23 patients 
(82.1%) had a favourable response, which was sustained 
in 10 patients for a median of 4.5 months. In a study 
of 24 patients given two doses of rituximab (375 mg/m2
once a week) at our centre, 20 patients (83.3%) were in 
remission at 1 year and 17 (71%) patients were in remis‑
sion at 17 months.52 These findings were confirmed 
in a large cohort that included 40 patients, of whom 
more than two-thirds were in sustained remission at 
12 months.64 A nationwide survey conducted in Japan 
showed the efficacy of rituximab in 55 patients with fre‑
quently relapsing or steroid-dependent nephrotic syn‑
drome.50 After a mean of 1.8 ± 1.4 doses of this agent, 
49.1% of patients were in remission at 7–31 months, and 
immunosuppressive therapy was discontinued in the 
majority of patients.50
Data on relapse rates are limited. In three studies 
including a total of 46 children, therapy with rituximab 
reduced the frequency of relapses by 62–95%.44,47,52 The 
proportion of patients who achieved sustained remission 
depended on the dosing strategy and duration of follow￾up (Table 1). In patients who received one dose of rituxi‑
mab (375 mg/m2
), 25–40% were in sustained remission 
at 12–17 months.44,47 Among patients who received 
2–4 doses of rituximab, >70% were in sustained remis‑
sion at 6–38 months.49,52,55,62 Another study reported 
a significantly longer time to relapse in 11 patients 
given four doses of rituximab than in 16 patients who 
received one or two doses (23.3 ± 18.7 months versus 
10.3±3.5 months, respectively).55 However, a correlation 
between the response to treatment and the number of 
doses was not seen in the IPNA questionnaire study.54
Treatment with rituximab enables considerable steroid 
sparing, with a substantial reduction in the steroid dose 
and discontinuation of other immunosuppressive 
therapies (see Table 1). Since most patients who receive 
rituximab have long-standing steroid-dependent disease 
with adverse effects related to therapy, the ability to 
discontinue steroid therapy is important.
Comparative studies
Few studies have compared the efficacy and safety of 
rituximab with that of other immunosuppressive agents 
(Table 2).65,66 The results of a randomized controlled trial 
in 54 patients with difficult-to-treat, steroid-dependent 
nephrotic syndrome showed that the combination of 
rituximab, calcineurin inhibitors and prednisone was not 
inferior to standard therapy with calcineurin inhibitors 
and prednisone in maintaining short-term remission.65

Compared with standard therapy, the additional use of 
rituximab produced a significant decline in proteinuria, 
relapse rates and steroid doses. However, the duration of 
follow-up was short and the implications of these findings 
for long-term management are unclear.
Another research group compared therapeutic out‑
comes at 1 year in nine patients who received combina‑
tion therapy consisting of a single dose of rituximab and 
oral mycophenolate mofetil, and seven patients given 
rituximab alone.67 The combined therapy resulted in a 
higher proportion of patients who achieved sustained 
remission and a longer time to first relapse than did 
single-dose rituximab. This finding was confirmed in a 
survey of patients in Japan, which showed relapses in 
15 of 40 (37.5%) rituximab-treated patients who con‑
tinued to receive ciclosporin, mycophenolate mofetil 
or mizoribine, compared with 13 of 15 (86.7%) patients 
treated with rituximab alone, usually in a single dose.50
However, another study did not show similar benefit 
in patients who continued to receive maintenance 
immunosuppression with ciclosporin after one or 
more doses of rituximab.55 Further studies are neces‑
sary to examine whether the number of rituximab doses 
might determine the need for subsequent therapy with 
immunosuppressive agents. Our research group has 
retrospectively compared the outcomes of 23 patients 
with difficult-to-treat, steroid-dependent nephrotic 
syndrome who received either rituximab (two or three 
doses of 375 mg/m2
 once a week) or oral tacrolimus 
(0.1–0.2 mg/kg per day for 12 months) in combination 
with prednisolone.68 At 12 months, the two treatments 
had similar efficacy: the reductions in the frequency of 
relapses, the proportion of patients in sustained remis‑
sion and decline in the steroid dose received were com‑
parable.68 The results from a prospective, multicentre, 
open-label trial (as yet published only as an abstract), 
show that therapy with one or two doses of rituximab 
leads to a significant decline in the relapse rate; 14 of 24 
(58.3%) patients with steroid-dependent or frequently 
relapsing nephrotic syndrome achieved remission despite 
withdrawal of all immunosuppressive medications.69
Treatment recommendations 
Treatment with rituximab seems to be a promising 
approach for patients with difficult-to-treat, steroid￾dependent nephrotic syndrome, but these positive 
results require confirmation in prospective studies. A 
double-blind placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of four doses of rituximab in patients 
with childhood-­onset, frequently relapsing, steroid￾dependent nephrotic syndrome is currently underway.4,70
Another trial is underway to examine the efficacy of two 
doses of rituximab in maintaining remission in patients 
who are calcineurin-inhibitor dependent.71
While awaiting the results of these and future studies 
(Supplementary Box 1 online), we propose that rituxi‑
mab should be used as rescue therapy in patients who 
have failed to respond to multiple immunosuppressive 
agents or in patients with calcineurin inhibitor toxicity. 
Treatment with rituximab might also be considered 
as an alternative to calcineurin inhibitors in patients 
with severe steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome. 
Rituximab should be given during remission, at a dose 
of 375 mg/m2
 once a week for two or more doses, to 
achieve CD19 levels below 1% of leukocytes. Although 
additional therapy with mycophenolate mofetil for 
up to 12 months might enable patients to achieve sus‑
tained remission, the indications for its use need to be 
defined. Re-treatment with rituximab with or without 
mycophenolate mofetil is an option in patients who show 
recurrence of frequent relapses.
Steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome
The efficacy of rituximab therapy in patients with 
difficult-­to-treat, steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome 
was first investigated in five patients (three of whom had 
FSGS) who received four doses of rituximab, adminis‑
tered once weekly.72 Four patients achieved complete 
remission and one had partial remission. Subsequently, 
other studies have shown success with rituximab treat‑
ment in a proportion of patients with minimal change 
disease or FSGS refractory to treatment with steroids 
and calcineurin inhibitors.73–75 Table 3 summarizes 
the current experience with rituximab in patients with 
steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome.50,52,54,61–63,76–79 All 
patients in these studies had nephrotic syndrome of 
long-standing duration and had received prior therapy 
with two or more agents, including corticosteroids, 
cyclophosphamide or calcineurin inhibitors.
Response to therapy
The four largest case series that evaluated the efficacy 
of rituximab included a total of 87 patients (11 of whom 
were adults, Table 3).50,52,54,77 The participants comprised 
almost equal proportions of patients with minimal 
change disease and FSGS.50,52,54,77 The indication for 
treatment was immediate or delayed unresponsiveness 
to calcineurin inhibitors, with or without overt toxic 
effects. Complete remission was seen in 0–27.3% of 
patients and partial remission in 21.2–37.5% of patients, 
for an overall remission rate of 45.6% patients.50,52,54,77
The timing of remission was variable, usually occurring 
within 4–6 weeks from completion of therapy, and was 
sustained for 6–24 months. In the patients who achieved 
remission, treatment with immunosuppressive agents 
could be tapered or discontinued.50,52,54,77
One study reported complete or partial remission 
of proteinuria in 10 of 11 adults treated with rituxi‑
mab; however, information on the efficacy of therapy 
was not provided separately for patients with steroid￾dependent nephrotic syndrome or steroid-resistant 
nephrotic syndrome.79 Other reports indicate satisfac‑
tory remission rates with rituximab therapy in patients 
with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome, although 
their small sample sizes, limited follow-up periods and 
the confounding effects of concomitant therapies make 
it difficult to define the efficacy of this intervention. A 
randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and 
safety of rituximab has been carried out in 31 children 
(aged 2–16 years) with nephrotic syndrome who had

not responded to treatment with calcineurin inhibitors 
and prednisone.66 All patients continued their existing 
medications, and one group was randomly assigned to 
receive additional therapy consisting of two doses of 
rituximab. Although depletion of B cells and adequate 
serum levels of rituximab were achieved, this therapy 
did not induce remission or reduce proteinuria in these 
patients (Table 2).
Factors affecting response to therapy
Steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome is a hetero￾geneous disease and the response of patients to immuno￾suppressive agents is influenced by multiple factors, 
including the presence of minimal change disease 
or FSGS, duration of illness and previous therapies. 
Approximately 20–35% of patients respond to treat‑
ment with alkylating agents, and 60–70% respond to 
treatment with calcineurin inhibitors. Rituximab therapy 
has been used chiefly in patients who do not respond to 
the above agents. However, the published studies have 
not identified any clinical or biochemical predictors of 
response to rituximab, or any relationship between the 
number of doses and the response to this treatment.54,77
Furthermore, many patients in these studies continued to 
receive one or more immunosuppressive agents, includ‑
ing calcineurin inhibitors, which might confound the 
effect of therapy with rituximab.61,63,77
Our experience suggests that findings on renal histo￾logy can help to predict the response of patients to 
treatment with rituximab: remission occurred in 64.7% 
of patients with minimal change disease, compared to 
31.3% of patients with FSGS.52 Collation of data from 
other case series suggests that patients with minimal 
change disease are significantly more likely to respond 
to treatment than those with FSGS (Figure 2).50,54,61–63,76–79
Treatment recommendations
Almost 60–70% of patients with steroid-resistant 
nephrotic syndrome treated with calcineurin inhibitors 
achieve complete or partial remission,9
 and at present 
no alternative agent shows superior efficacy. However, 
therapy with rituximab might be useful in two instances. 
First, in patients who respond to calcineurin inhibitors, 
treatment with 2–4 doses of rituximab might be used to 
maintain remission and enable withdrawal of calcineurin 
inhibitors, especially in the presence of drug-related toxic 
effects. Second, the results of retrospective case series 
suggest that treatment with rituximab might be effective

in some patients with nephrotic syndrome resistant 
to corticosteroid and calcineurin inhibitor therapy. 
However, the results of a randomized controlled trial 
that examined the efficacy of rituximab in such patients 
were not encouraging.66 Adequately powered studies 
with long-term follow-up of groups of patients stratified 
for renal histology are required to clarify the benefits of 
these treatment strategies.
Recurrent FSGS
Patients with idiopathic FSGS and persistent proteinuria 
in the nephrotic range are at risk of developing kidney 
failure that requires renal transplantation. Approximately 
30% of such patients develop recurrence of FSGS after 
the first allograft.80,81 Features associated with FSGS 
recurrence include onset of nephrotic syndrome below 
the age of 15 years, rapid progression to end-stage renal 
disease (within 3 years from onset), mesangial prolifera‑
tion on renal histopathology, white ethnicity and non‑
genetic (immune) forms of FSGS.82,83 The increased risk 
of FSGS recurrence in children who receive renal grafts 
from living donors84 is balanced by the reduced risk of 
rejection and decreased need for immunosuppression.85
Recurrence of FSGS usually occurs within hours to days 
after the transplant procedure, and is characterized 
by proteinuria in the nephrotic range and progressive 
hypoalbuminaemia.6
 These patients are at increased 
risk of allograft failure (5-year kidney graft survival 
is 57% in patients with recurrent FSGS versus 82% in 
patients without recurrence).86,87 After the loss of the first 
allograft, the risk of recurrence of FSGS in subsequent 
kidney transplants is 80–100%.88
Strategies for the management of patients with 
recurrent FSGS include the use of plasma exchange or 
immunoadsorption in combination with high-dose 
ciclosporin and cyclophosphamide. By using these 
strategies, 70% of children and 63% of adults with recur‑
rent FSGS achieve complete or partial remission.89 In 
one case report, a decline in proteinuria was observed 
after rituximab therapy in a boy aged 12 years with 
recurrent FSGS treated for post-transplant lympho￾proliferative disorder.90 Subsequently, some researchers 
have reported remission of proteinuria with the use of 
rituximab (2–6 doses of 375 mg/m2
, administered once 
every 1–2 weeks) in conjunction with plasma exchange 
and post-­transplantation immunosuppression.
Experience with rituximab therapy in patients with 
recurrent FSGS has been summarized in a system‑
atic review6
 and a multicentre report (Table 4).54 The 
review included data on 39 patients with recurrent 
FSGS. Proteinuria in the nephrotic range and hypo￾albuminaemia were present in 74.3% of patients within 
1 month of kidney transplantation.6
 Combined therapy 
with plasmapheresis and rituximab resulted in complete 
or partial remission of proteinuria in 64.1% of patients. 
The median time to best clinical response was 2 months 
(range 0.6–12.0 months). On univariate analysis, a young 
age at transplantation, normal serum albumin level at 
recurrence of FSGS and the need for fewer rituximab 
infusions was associated with an improved response 
to treatment. Response was not related to the kidney 
donor type (living or deceased), the use of pretransplant 
or post-transplant plasmapheresis, other immuno￾suppressive therapy or the post-transplant severity of 
proteinuria. On stepwise regression analysis, normal 
serum albumin level at recurrence (which implies mild 
FSGS) and young age predicted a favourable response to 
rituximab therapy.6
 The IPNA study showed that therapy 
with 1–4 doses of rituximab in combination with plasma‑
pheresis resulted in complete or partial remission in nine 
of 15 (60%) patients (Table 4).54 Five of the seven patients 
treated with B‑cell depletion showed complete or partial 
remission; two patients (one with and one without 
B‑cell depletion) were nonresponders.54 In a review of 
data from 25 patients with recurrent FSGS treated with 
rituximab infusions and plasma exchange, the 12 patients 
who achieved remission had received rituximab infu‑
sions significantly earlier than the 13 patients who did 
not respond (mean 100.5 ± 95.4 days from the onset of 
recurrence versus 468.1 ± 379.8 days, respectively).91
In another report, six of eight patients with recur‑
rent FSGS refractory to plasmapheresis achieved com‑
plete or partial remission with 1–4 doses of rituximab.92
Furthermore, patients who had relapses of proteinuria 
responded to re-treatment with rituximab. Treatment 
with plasmapheresis and two doses of rituximab induced 
complete or partial remission in four adults with recur‑
rent FSGS (Table 4).93 Other reports indicate similar 
findings that rituximab is effective in sustaining remis‑
sion in patients who either do not respond to or who 
are dependent on plasmapheresis.94–96 Although the

to plasmapheresis cannot be excluded, the timing of 
response correlated with that of rituximab therapy.
Prevention of recurrent FSGS
Combined therapy with rituximab and pretransplant 
plasmapheresis is useful in kidney transplant recipients 
at high risk of recurrence of FSGS. Therapy with 1–2 
doses of rituximab and multiple sessions of plasma￾pheresis prevented recurrent FSGS in recipients of a 
second kidney transplant who were followed up for 
12–54 months.97 In a report, a girl aged 7.9 years with 
a history of recurrent FSGS was successfully managed 
using four sessions of plasmapheresis and a single dose 
of rituximab (375 mg/m2
) 21 days before transplanta‑
tion.98 In another report, administration of rituximab 
within 24h after transplantation prevented recurrence of 
FSGS (Table 2).35 Recurrent FSGS was noted in 25.9% 
of 27 patients treated with rituximab, compared with 
64.3% of 14 patients who did not receive the medica‑
tion.35 However, the overall incidence of FSGS recur‑
rence in this study was considerably higher than that 
reported in the literature; the recurrence rate in patients 
receiving rituximab was close to that cited elsewhere for 
untreated patients.
Treatment recommendations 
All patients with FSGS who are about to undergo renal 
transplantation should be advised about the possibil‑
ity of recurrence of this disease. Pre-emptive plasma 
exchange should be planned in advance of living-donor 
transplantation.99 Early and aggressive therapy with 
immunosuppression and plasma exchange should be 
initiated if proteinuria develops after transplantation.
The efficacy of rituximab in patients with recurrent 
FSGS is difficult to estimate owing to confounding effects 
from other concomitant therapies. Combination therapy 
with plasma exchange and rituximab has shown promise 
in the prevention and treatment of recurrent FSGS, but 
the efficacy of this approach needs to be examined in 
prospective controlled studies.82 Rituximab is cleared 
from the body by plasma exchange;100 we suggest, there‑
fore, an interval of 36–48h between rituximab infusion 
and plasmapheresis.
Idiopathic membranous glomerulonephritis
Membranous nephropathy is the principal cause of 
nephrotic syndrome in adults,101,102 among whom 
idiopathic membranous nephropathy accounts for 
32–80% of diagnoses. Secondary causes of membranous 
nephropathy include systemic lupus erythematosus, 
chronic infections (especially hepatitis B), medications 
or malignancy.103,104 Spontaneous remission occurs in 
30–40% of patients within 12–24 months.105 Current 
therapies include inhibitors of the renin–angiotensin–
aldosterone system, and combinations of corticosteroids 
with alkylating agents or calcineurin inhibitors.106 The 
results of randomized trials indicate that therapy with 
the above-mentioned agents can induce remission in 
59–90% of patients; however, relapse rates are high and 
patients with proteinuria in the nephrotic range can 
develop progressive renal failure.107,108 The efficacy of 
rituximab was initially reported in eight patients with

been used in the treatment of both idiopathic and secon￾dary forms of the disease, as first-line therapy and after 
patients fail to respond to standard therapy.
Pathogenesis of membranous glomerulonephritis 
Membranous glomerulonephritis is thought to result 
from an immune response in which podocyte antigens 
are targeted by circulating IgG4 antibodies. Subepithelial 
deposition of these immune complexes results in podo‑
cyte injury and loss of the filtration barrier. Of particular 
interest is an autoantibody against the M‑type isoform of 
the phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R).110 Support for a 
pathogenetic role of this autoantibody comes from find‑
ings of associations between titres of this antibody and 
nephrotic range proteinuria or post-transplant recur‑
rence of idiopathic membranous nephropathy.111–113
Positive staining for PLA2R was found in immune 
deposits in kidney biopsy samples from patients with 
membranous nephropathy.114 Patients with membra‑
nous nephropathy and autoantibodies against PLA2R 
often also have elevated levels of antibodies against 
other antigens, including neutral endopeptidase, aldose 
reductase, superoxide dismutase 2 and α‑enolase.115
Although rituximab therapy does not remove circulating 
autoantibodies, treated patients show a decline in the 
titre of anti-PLA2R antibodies and remission of protein￾uria.45,111,114,116 Table 5 and Supplementary Figure 1 online 
show the clinical response of patients with membranous 
nephropathy to rituximab.30,61,114,116–121 However, hetero‑
geneity in previous therapies, dosing schedules of rituxi‑
mab and definitions of response (Box 1) make it difficult 
to collate data from these studies.
The efficacy of rituximab therapy has been assessed 
in a systematic review of data from 21 studies, includ‑
ing 69 patients with idiopathic membranous nephro￾pathy.117 The complete response rate was 15–20% and the 
partial response rate was 35–40%. Although these figures 
are inferior to those reported for treatment with alky￾lating agents and calcineurin inhibitors, many patients 
in these studies had previously failed to respond to the 
above therapies.117 In a prospective cohort study of 100 
consecutive patients with membranous nephropathy 
who were followed up for 2.5 years after treatment with 
1–4 doses of rituximab, complete and partial remission 
occurred in 27 and 38 patients, respectively, at a median

of 7.1 months (range 3.2–12.0 months).121 One-third of 
patients in this cohort had failed to respond to previous 
therapy with other medications. Remission was seen in 
47 of 68 (69.1%) patients given rituximab as the primary 
immunosuppressive agent, and in 18 of 32 (56.3%) 
patients who received rituximab after the failure of an 
alternative immunosuppressive agent. Remission rates 
were similar in a prospective cohort of patients treated 
with rituximab as first-line therapy and a retrospective 
cohort of patients who received this agent as second￾line therapy and were matched for age, sex and severity 
of proteinuria.120 Three separate reports provide infor‑
mation on the efficacy of rituximab in the treatment of 
patients with post-transplantation recurrence of mem‑
branous nephropathy.117,119,122 Therapy with 1–8 doses of 
rituximab stabilized renal function and induced com‑
plete or partial remission in 13 of 14 patients,117,119,122
including those who required re-treatment.122
A prospective study indicates that the proportion of 
patients with membranous nephropathy who achieve 
complete and partial remission increases over time, 
indicating a delayed response.121 Other studies have also 
reported increasing rates of remission during extended 
follow-up30,114,120 and that remission is sustained after 
B‑cell recovery. These observations might reflect gradual 
clearance of glomerular immune deposits, correction of 
pathological abnormalities and/or resolution of protein‑
uria. Although these patients might relapse, re-treatment 
with rituximab is effective in inducing further remis‑
sion.114,116,118–121 Most studies do not provide information 
on the effect of rituximab therapy on kidney function; 
however, in one study, the glomerular filtration rate 
(GFR) increased in patients with complete remission, but 
progressively declined in those who did not respond to 
therapy.121 Other studies confirm that remission of mem‑
branous nephropathy improves30,118 or stabilizes114,119,120
renal function. 
Predictors of a lack of response to rituximab therapy 
in patients with membranous nephropathy include a 
high tubulointerstitial score, tubular atrophy and inter‑
stitial fibrosis in kidney biopsy samples,123 and impaired 
renal function at baseline (estimated GFR <45 ml/
min/1.73 m2
).114 By contrast, in another case series, no 
relationship was noted between the response to therapy 
and histological findings.30 In one study, urinary excre‑
tion of α1 microglobulin, retinol-binding protein, 
albumin and IgG at baseline correlated well with the 
rate of response to rituximab at 12 months but not at 
24 months.124
Reports demonstrate that anti-PLA2R antibody 
titres decline after therapy with rituximab. Antibodies 
to PLA2R were detected at baseline in 10 of 28 patients 
treated with rituximab, and were absent in all five 
patients tested for these antibodies after complete or 
partial remission.114 In a case series, a decline in anti￾PLA2R antibody titre was associated with a reduction in 
proteinuria in two patients, whereas the three patients 
in whom anti-PLA2R antibody titres increased did 
not enter remission.115 These findings were confirmed 
in another study, which showed that patients with 
decreasing anti-PLA2R antibody levels after rituximab 
treatment had increased rates of remission at 12 and 
24 months.108
Treatment recommendations 
The 2012 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes 
guidelines recommend that immunosuppressive therapy 
should be initiated in patients with idiopathic membra￾nous nephropathy who have nephrotic syndrome, 
proteinuria of ≥4 g per day and estimated GFR ≥30 ml/
min/1.73 m2
 who fail to respond to 6 months of treat‑
ment with antihypertensive and antiproteinuric agents.107
An initial immunosuppressive regimen that combines 
corticosteroids and an alkylating agent is recommended, 
if that fails calcineurin inhibitors should be used. 
Therapy with 2–4 doses of rituximab is likely to result 
in complete remission in 20–33% of patients and partial 
remission in 20–60% of patients who fail to respond to 
treatment with cyclophosphamide or calcineurin inhibi‑
tors.7
 The results of ongoing prospective studies are 
expected to clarify the benefits of this medication.125,126
Adverse effects of rituximab
Therapy with rituximab is well tolerated in most 
patients; however, a number of adverse affects have been 
documented (Table 6).4,52,55,62,76,77,127
Infusion reactions
Acute reactions can occur within the first 30–120min of 
an infusion,5,117 with an incidence that ranges from 9.1% 
to 56.3%.30,47,48,50,51,54,67,79,114,121 Commonly reported reac‑
tions include flu-like symptoms, chills, fever, headache, 
myalgia, itching, erythematous rash,30,44,47,48,54,55,66,68,117,120,121
cough, sore throat, nasal congestion, tachycardia,44,48 and 
hypotension44,48,121 or hypertension.44,76 These symptoms 
can be minimized by pretreatment with antihistamines 
and/or corticosteroids. The intensity of symptoms 
declines on stopping the infusion and they rarely recur. 
Anaphylaxis54,128 and/or bronchospasm44,48,65,66,117,121
are rarely reported in association with rituximab infu‑
sions. In view of the risk of infusion reactions, cautious 
administration is advised, beginning with a slow infu‑
sion rate and increasing the rate at 30 min intervals. In 
adult oncology practice, the first dose of rituximab is 
infused over 6 h and subsequent doses are given over a 
4h period.129
Risk of infections
Patients receiving rituximab are at increased risk of 
infections with usual or unusual organisms, includ‑
ing pyogenic infections, tuberculosis and cytomegalo￾virus.51,117,130 The risk of infections is also increased by 
concomitant use of other immunosuppressive agents 
and the underlying disorder. Since CD20 is not present 
on plasma cells, immunoglobulin production is not 
altered and the risk of hypogammaglobulinaemia is 
low (Table 6).44,47,48,54,61,118,131,132 However, low serum 
levels of immunoglobulins have been noted in a few 
patients receiving maintenance rituximab after haemato￾poietic stem cell transplantation,133 malignancies134

or autoimmune cytopenias.135 A meta-analysis of data 
from three placebo-controlled randomized trials (includ‑
ing 938 patients) of rituximab therapy in patients with 
rheumatoid arthritis showed no increase in the incidence 
of infections.136 Systematic reviews of rituximab therapy 
in patients with lymphomas show that this treatment is 
associated with a twofold increase in the risk of neutro￾penia and infections137–139 compared with standard 
therapy, perhaps as a result of the increased dosage of 
rituximab and the underlying disease The dose speci‑
fied is higher than usually used for nephrotic syndrome. 
Patients with nephrotic syndrome treated with rituximab 
may show transient leukopenia associated with bacte‑
rial sepsis or pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis jiroveci 
(formerly known as P. carinii),48,51,52,54,76,140 similar to that 
reported in patients with haematologic malignancies or 
rheumatoid arthritis.141 Therefore, the use of cotrimoxa‑
zole prophylaxis should be considered in patients with 
nephrotic syndrome who are receiving rituximab therapy 
and concomitant immunosuppression. A report on 19 
patients with difficult-to-treat systemic lupus erythema‑
tosus who were given two doses of rituximab showed 
exacerbation of herpes zoster infection in five patients.142
Another study reported increased infection-related 
mortality in 77 kidney transplant recipients treated with 
rituximab.143 By contrast, infection rates were similar in 
170 highly sensitized kidney transplant recipients treated 
with rituximab and intravenous immunoglobulin and 
in 191 nonsensitized patients who did not receive this 
combination therapy.144
Patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma and colla‑
gen vascular disorders treated with rituximab are at 
risk of reactivation of hepatitis B infection, resulting in 
fulminant liver failure.145 The use of rituximab should, 
therefore, be avoided in patients who are positive for 
hepatitis B antigens.146
Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy
Evidence indicates a possible association between long￾term rituximab therapy and progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy (PML), an encephalitis caused 
by JC polyomavirus.147 Multiple case reports describe 
PML in rituximab-treated patients with haematologi‑
cal malignancies, systemic lupus erythematosus and 
rheumatoid arthritis, which have prompted modification 
of current prescribing information (including a ‘black 
box’ warning).148 Patients with PML show a gradual onset 
of cognitive impairment, motor weakness, speech prob‑
lems and deterioration of vision. The diagnosis is made 
on the basis of these clinical features, MRI findings and 
demonstration of polyomavirus in brain biopsy samples 
or cerebrospinal fluid.
PML has not been reported in patients with nephrotic 
syndrome treated with rituximab. Screening of blood and 
urine specimens from 11 children with nephrotic syn‑
drome treated with rituximab and eight controls showed 
the presence of JC virus in the urine of one patient and 
one control.149 BK virus was found in the urine of seven 
patients and two controls, and in blood samples from 
four patients.149 The above findings suggest the need 
for increased awareness regarding these infections in 
immunocompromised patients.

in adults treated for B‑cell lymphoma150 and other dis‑
orders.151 Two systematic reviews on rituximab-induced

lung disease (in 121151 and 30152 patients, respectively) 
suggest a mortality rate of 14.9–29.0%. Pulmonary symp‑
toms usually occur after a mean of four (range 1–12) 
doses of rituximab, 1–3 months after the last infusion. 
Clinical features include dyspnoea, fever, nonproductive 
cough and hypoxaemia, with bilateral lung infiltrates, 
reduced diffusion capacity and a restrictive ventilatory 
pattern. Rarely, patients have hypoxaemia and respira‑
tory insufficiency after the first infusion.153 Pathological 
findings include bronchiolitis obliterans organizing 
pneumonia, interstitial pneumonitis, acute respiratory 
distress syndrome and hypersensitivity pneumonitis.154
Acute lung injury with thrombotic microangiopathy, 
multiorgan dysfunction and death was reported in one 
patient treated with rituximab for recurrent FSGS.92
Rituximab should be used cautiously in patients with 
underlying lung disease, and a diagnosis of rituximab￾related lung injury should be considered in any patient 
who develops respiratory symptoms or new radiographic 
changes after therapy. Affected patients are treated with 
supportive care and corticosteroids, although the efficacy 
of steroids is not proven.152
Human antichimaeric antibodies
Repeated use of rituximab in patients with systemic 
lupus erythematosus and lymphoma is associated with 
the formation of human antichimaeric antibodies.155,156
The presence of host antibodies to the murine peptide 
sequences in rituximab might cause an anaphylactic 
reaction in some patients or, by increasing rituximab 
clearance, reduce its efficacy.73,157,158 The presence of 
human antichimaeric antibodies in six of 14 patients 
with idiopathic membranous nephropathy did not 
affect the response to rituximab.30 Development of 
human antichimaeric antibodies is thought to be linked 
to the rituximab dosing schedule, since they are more 
common in patients who received one rather than four 
doses of this agent.2,158,159 The development of human 
antichimaeric antibodies might be minimized with 
the use of new humanized or fully human monoclonal 
antibodies against CD20.160
Conclusions
Rituximab has mild to moderate efficacy and a favour‑
able safety profile in patients with difficult-to-treat 
nephrotic syndrome. However, the current literature on 
its efficacy in this setting is based chiefly on case series 
and data from very few randomized controlled trials. 
For this reason, firm recommendations cannot yet be 
presented for its use in clinical practice. Despite the 
limitations of the available evidence, satisfactory results 
have been obtained with rituximab therapy in patients 
with refractory steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome, 
recurrent FSGS and membranous nephropathy. By 
contrast, this treatment has limited benefits in patients 
with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome. Prospective, 
randomized controlled studies with adequate sample 
sizes and appropriate follow-up are necessary to define 
the indications for therapy with rituximab therapy, and 
to determine outcomes and predictors of response.
Review criteria
We searched PubMed and EMBASE for full-text articles 
mainly in the English language published from January 
2002 to October 2012, using the following terms: 
“nephrotic syndrome”, “rituximab”, “CD20”, “minimal 
change”, “focal segmental glomerulosclerosis”, 
“recurrent FSGS”, “membranous glomerulonephritis” 
and “membranous nephropathy”. The reference lists of 
selected publications were reviewed to identify additional 
relevant articles. To reduce publication bias, we included 
data from systematic reviews and studies including four 
or more patients, except in the case of papers relating 
to recurrent focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and 
adverse effects, for which even single case reports were 
considered. Studies by the same group of authors were 
scrutinized to avoid overlap in the reporting of findings 
derived from the same patients.
