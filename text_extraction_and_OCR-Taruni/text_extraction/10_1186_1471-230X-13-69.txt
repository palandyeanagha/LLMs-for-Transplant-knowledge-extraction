Abstract
Background: Intestinal ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) can occur in clinical scenarios such as organ transplantation,
trauma and cardio-pulmonary bypass, as well as in neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis or persistent ductus arteriosus.
Pharmacological protection by pretreating (“preconditioning”) with opioids attenuates IRI in a number of organs.
Remifentanil appears particularly attractive for this purpose because of its ultra-short duration of action and
favorable safety profile. To date, little is known about opioid preconditioning of the intestine.
Methods: Young adult C57BL/6J mice were randomly assigned to receive tail vein injections of 1 μg/kg of
remifentanil or normal saline and underwent either ischemia-reperfusion of the intestine or a sham laparotomy.
Under isoflurane anesthesia, the mice were subjected to intestinal ischemia-reperfusion by occlusion (clamping) of
the superior mesenteric artery for 30 min, followed by unclamping and 60 min of reperfusion. After completion of
this protocol, tissue injury and lipid peroxidation in jejunum and ileum were analyzed by histology and
malondialdehyde (MDA), respectively. Systemic interleukin (IL)-6 was determined in the plasma by ELISA.
Results: Pretreatment with remifentanil markedly reduced intestinal IRI (P < 0.001): In the ileum, we observed a
more than 8-fold decrease in injured villi (4% vs 34% in saline-pretreated animals). In fact, the mucosa in the
remifentanil group was as healthy as that of sham-operated animals. This protective effect was not as pronounced
in the jejunum, but the percentage of damaged villi was still reduced considerably (18% vs 42%). There was up to
3-fold more tissue MDA after intestinal ischemia-reperfusion than after sham laparotomy, but this increase in lipid
peroxidation was prevented by preconditioning with remifentanil (P < 0.05). The systemic inflammatory response
triggered by intestinal IRI was significantly attenuated in mice pretreated with remifentanil (159 vs 805 pg/ml of IL-6
after saline pretreatment, with 92 pg/ml in the sham groups). After sham operations, no difference was detected
between the saline- and remifentanil-pretreatments in any of the parameters investigated.
Conclusion: Preconditioning with remifentanil attenuates intestinal IRI and the subsequent systemic inflammatory
response in mice. We therefore suggest that prophylaxis with this ultra-short-acting opioid may be advantageous in
various clinical scenarios of human IRI.

Background
Interruption of blood supply to an organ rapidly leads to
cellular dysfunction and cell death [1]. Although subse￾quent reperfusion can salvage affected tissues after
sustained ischemia, the reperfusion itself induces further
injury. Ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) can be attributed
to many factors such as the release of free oxygen radicals
and consecutive lipid peroxidation, cell death by apoptosis
or necrosis, inflammatory cytokines, and damage to the
microvasculature [1-4].
Preconditioning refers to application of a protective inter￾vention prior to ischemia. This can be mechanical (brief ep￾isodes of ischemia and reperfusion) or pharmacological.
Ischemic preconditioning was first proposed as a possible
therapeutic strategy in 1986, where it was shown to reduce
infarct sizes in rat hearts by up to 75% [5]. Since then, is￾chemic preconditioning has been tested and demonstrated
to attenuate IRI in other organs such as the lung [6], kidney
[7], liver [8], brain [9], spinal cord [10], and intestine [11].
However, the application of mechanical preconditioning
is often difficult or, particularly in the human, impossible.
Therefore, interest in pharmacological preconditioning has
increased, and opioids were among the first drugs shown to
trigger the cascades of preconditioning. In fact, it is inter￾esting to note that the primary use of several of the drugs
capable of preconditioning is in perioperative anesthesia
(opioids and volatile sedatives [12-16]). Other examples of
agents include nitric oxide and glutamine supplementation
as well as the use of antioxidants and leptin [1,17].
IRI of the intestine can occur in many medical and
surgical situations such as cardiopulmonary bypass,
trauma, organ transplantation, as well as in neonatal
diseases, including necrotizing enterocolitis and per￾sistent ductus arteriosus [18,19]. Ischemia-reperfusion
to the intestine is detrimental not only for nutrient
absorption by the mucosa but also compromises barrier
integrity, leading to possible bacterial translocation
across the gut wall, peritonitis and subsequently sys￾temic sepsis [18].
Remifentanil is an ultra-short acting, synthetic μ-opioid
analgesic with an onset of action of only 1 minute. Its
half-life is also very short (3 to 5 minutes) as it is rapidly
degraded by tissue and blood esterases. These unique
pharmacokinetic properties of remifentanil make it an
easily manageable preconditioning agent. Studies into the
benefits of remifentanil-induced preconditioning have to
date been limited to the heart, liver and kidney [20-25].
Here, we set out to investigate the possible protective
effects of remifentanil on intestinal IRI. Using an adult
mouse model of intestinal IRI, we assessed the protective
properties of remifentanil by analyzing the degree of injury
and oxidative stress by histology and malondialdehyde
(MDA) assays, as well as the systemic effects by measuring
interleukin 6 (IL-6).
Methods
Animals
Young male adult (8–12 weeks) C57BL/6J mice weighing
24 to 30 g were used for this study. Mice were obtained
from the Monash Medical Centre Animal Facility
(Monash Medical Centre, Melbourne, Australia) and
reared at room temperature on a 12 h/12 h light–dark
cycle in specific pathogen-free housing prior to experi￾mentation. They were fed standard rodent diet with free
access to water. All animal work conformed with the
guidelines established by the National Health and
Medical Research Council of Australia and had the
approval of the Standing Committee in Ethics in Animal
Experimentation of Monash University.
Ischemia-reperfusion model
Mice were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane (balance O2)
by inhalation through a gas mask. All animals were
secured in a supine position onto a heating pad to main￾tain normal body temperature during the procedure.
Mice were first randomly separated into a sham and an
ischemia-reperfusion group. Within each group, the
animals were then again randomly allocated into two
groups to receive a 300 μl slow (1 min) tail vein injection of
either: (1) vehicle control (normal saline) or (2) 1 μg/kg
remifentanil (Ultiva; GlaxoSmithKline Limited, Melbourne,
Australia). Five minutes after injection, a lower midline
laparotomy was performed, the superior mesenteric artery
(SMA) identified and clamped with a non-crushing clamp
for 30 minutes. Thereafter, the SMA was unclamped, by
which a 60 minute period of reperfusion commenced.
During the ischemia-reperfusion period, the mice continu￾ously received 1% isoflurane in O2. At the end of the reper￾fusion period, blood was collected via cardiac puncture. All
animals were humanely killed via cervical dislocation.
Histological analysis
The small intestine was collected and flushed with
ice-cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to remove
intraluminal contents. Tissue was evenly divided into
two proximal (P1 and P2) and two distal (D1 and D2)
sections, with the proximal sections approximately
corresponding to the jejunum and the distal ones to the
ileum. P2 and D2 were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde
overnight and subsequently embedded in paraffin.
Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of 4 μm thick
sections were evaluated microscopically using a 0–5
grading system published previously [26], which is
shown in Figure 1 and described in the Results section.
Using ImageScope (Aperio, Vista, USA), five random
fields of view (100 × magnification) were taken and each
individual villus was graded (~50 total villi per intestinal
region). The assessor was blinded to the treatment
groups.

Malondialdehyde (MDA) assay
The P1 and D1 sections of the intestines were collected
post-reperfusion and flushed with ice-cold PBS before
being snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C.
For the assay, tissue was mechanically homogenized
and processed using an Ultra-Turrax disperser (IKA,
Guangzhou, China). An OxiSelect Thiobarbituric Acid
Reactive Substances (TBARS) Assay Kit (Cell Biolabs Inc,
San Diego, USA) was used to determine the MDA content
in the supernatants of the homogenates via colorimetric
quantification (532 nm) of the MDA-thiobarbituric acid
reaction. Total protein concentration (t.p.) was deter￾mined using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay (Bio-Rad,
Hercules, USA). Absolute MDA values were normalized
to their respective individual total protein concentrations
by dividing absolute MDA value by total protein concen￾tration. Results are expressed as nmol MDA/mg total
protein.
Determination of cytokines
After reperfusion, blood was collected into heparinized
tubes and plasma isolated via centrifugation (300 × g for
10 min). Plasma was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and
stored at −20°C until assayed. Plasma IL-6 was measured
by ELISA using the mouse IL-6 ELISA Set (BD Biosci￾ences, San Diego, USA).
Statistical analysis
Data analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 5.0
(GraphPad Software, San Diego, USA). The difference in
frequency of histopathological grades between treatment
groups was analyzed by chi-square test. All other
comparisons between groups were calculated using the
Mann–Whitney rank sum U-test (one tailed). Differ￾ences were considered to be statistically significant if the
P value was less than 0.05. All data are presented as
means ± standard error of the mean (s.e.m.).
Results
Animals preconditioned with remifentanil exhibit
significantly reduced mucosal damage
Using the scoring system published by Chiu et al. [26],
we evaluated the severity of mucosal injury to the intes￾tines after IRI using a numerical grading score of 0 to 5
as shown in Figure 1. Grade 0 represents normal villi
and grades 1–5 indicate increments of severity of injury
from mild (1), identified by development of subepithelial
Gruenhagen’s spaces (Figure 1, black arrow), to progres￾sive lifting of the epithelial layer from the lamina propria
(moderate - grade 2, severe - grade 3). Completely
denuded villi (grade 4) and disintegration of the lamina
propria (grade 5) is characteristic of the severe end of
the spectrum of intestinal IRI.
Figure 2 depicts representative images of intestines
from mice of the different treatment groups, with the
sections of the jejunum (proximal intestine) in the left
column (panels A, C, E) and the ileum (distal intestine)
in the right column (panels B, D, F). Mice in the
remifentanil preconditioning (RPC) group (Figure 2E, F)
displayed improved preservation of healthy gut mucosa
after reperfusion compared to saline-pretreatment
(Figure 2C, D). No histological differences were observed

lifting of epithelial layer from lamina propria; 3, marked epithelial lifting down the sides of the villi, a few tips may be denuded; 4, denuded villi

lamina propria, hemorrhage and ulceration. Magnification 200 ×; scale bars indicate 50 μm.

between the treatment groups (RPC or saline) in the
sham-operated animals (Figure 2A, B). As expected, the
overall health of the intestinal mucosa was nearly
unaffected in this sham control group.
As illustrated in Figure 3A, significant injury as a re￾sult of IRI in the jejunum was evident by the increase in
percentage of injured villi in saline-pretreated mice in
comparison to the two sham-operated groups (percent￾age for grades 1-5: 42% for IR-saline vs 12% for sham-sa￾line and 8% for sham-RPC). On the other hand, the
percentage of injured villi in the RPC group was com￾parable to that in the sham-operated groups (18% grade
1-5). Among the sham groups, no differences were ob￾served in any of the parameters we investigated.
Using chi-square analysis on the distribution of histo￾logical injury grades (Figure 3 insets), we observed that
there was a significant difference in the degree of injury bet￾ween RPC and saline-pretreated mice post-IRI (P < 0.001).
In the saline-pretreated group post-IRI, grade 3 (12%) and
4 (13%) mucosal injury was the most common finding,
whereas in the RPC animals, the pattern of injury we
observed was milder, with the majority of villi falling into
grades 1–3 (16%).
Although this trend towards amelioration of IRI by
remifentanil in the jejunum did not reach statistical
significance (P=0.12), it was consistent with the
impressive findings we obtained from samples of the
ileum (Figure 3B). The ileum of RPC animals post-IRI
exhibited an almost completely healthy mucosa, unlike
that of saline-pretreated animals (96% vs 66% grade 0).
Among the remaining 4% of injured mucosa in the RPC
group, nearly all villi were scored grade 1, whereas villi
from saline-pretreated animals were scored across the
entire spectrum of severity (grades 1–5, Figure 3B inset).
The ileal mucosa in the RPC group after IRI was identi￾cal to that in sham-operated animals (91% and 94%

grade 0 for RPC and saline), both on the overall level
(Figure 3B) and the individual grades of injury (exclu￾sively grade 1 in the sham groups, which are not shown
in the insets).
Preconditioning with remifentanil reduces oxidative stress
in intestinal ischemia-reperfusion injury
Homogenates of the jejunum and the ileum were
assayed for MDA as a marker of oxidative stress [27].
The abundance of MDA in the ileum (Figure 4) was sig￾nificantly elevated in saline-pretreated mice after IR in
comparison with the sham-operated groups (0.47 nmol/
mg t.p. in IR-saline vs 0.14 and 0.19 nmol/mg t.p. in
sham-saline and -RPC). Consistent with the histological
findings, RPC protected the ileal tissue from this in￾crease in lipid peroxidation (MDA at 0.25 nmol/mg t.p.
after IR and remifentanil, i.e. nearly at steady state
levels).
However, this pattern was different in the jejunum,
where we measured considerably more MDA under
sham conditions (0.47 ± 0.05 and 0.40 ± 0.09 nmol/mg
t.p. for saline and RPC). As in each of the other parame￾ters of IRI, there was no difference between RPC and
saline pretreatment; however, the difference between the
jejunum and the ileum was significant (P < 0.01 for both
sham groups in the jejunum vs both sham groups in the
ileum). In mice that had undergone intestinal IRI and sa￾line pretreatment, the jejunal abundance of MDA was
similar (0.41 ± 0.04 nmol/mg t.p.) and RPC also did not

significantly change lipid peroxidation in this section of
the intestine (0.36 ± 0.07 nmol/mg t.p.).
The induction of IL-6 is attenuated by pretreatment with
remifentanil
As expected, the abundance of IL-6 in the plasma of
sham-operated mice was low and there was no differ￾ence between the pretreatment groups (Figure 5). IRI
induced a marked, approximately 8-fold increase of
plasma IL-6 (to 805 pg/ml), which was reduced to 159
pg/ml, i.e. nearly to the level of the sham groups, by
preconditioning with remifentanil.
Discussion
We have shown that preconditioning with remifentanil
powerfully counteracts the injury to the intestinal
mucosa caused by a period of ischemia and subsequent
reperfusion. A marked amelioration of mucosal injury in
remifentanil-treated mice was accompanied by a reduc￾tion of oxidative stress locally and inflammation system￾ically, as evidenced by decreased concentrations of gut
tissue MDA and plasma IL-6. Although morphine has
been shown to precondition the rat intestine, our study
is first to demonstrate that remifentanil conveys a simi￾lar protective effect, possibly through an attenuation of
systemic inflammation in addition to triggering the
preconditioning cascade [28]. This has important poten￾tial clinical implications because, unlike morphine,
remifentanil can be given in high doses intraoperatively
without the risk of residual postoperative adverse
effects such as respiratory depression and gut
dysmotility [29].
Remifentanil is administered to patients as a bolus or as
a continuous intravenous infusion. Both a preconditioning
bolus as well as a continuous infusion has been found to
reduce myocardial infarction to a similar extent [20].
However, the preconditioning bolus was observed to be
better at preserving myocardial function, suggesting that
bolus administration may be superior to continuous
infusion. A single bolus injection can be easily managed
and allows for higher doses and thus higher peak levels,
which likely boost protective effects. Indeed, in myocardial
models of IRI, an increased RPC dosage has been shown to
reduce infarct size and the abundance of pro-inflammatory
mediators such as IL-6 in a dose-dependent manner [30].
Both the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS),
as well as increased apoptosis contribute significantly to
epithelial damage in intestinal IRI [3,31]. Mechanically￾induced ischemic preconditioning of the heart [32] and
intestine [33] has been shown to increase expression of
Bcl-2, which has an anti-apoptotic as well as anti￾oxidant property. Similarly, in remifentanil-induced
heart preconditioning, the expression of Bcl-2 is also
reported to increase. Moreover, the expression of Bax, a
promoter of ROS production as well as apoptosis, is re￾duced [23,34]. Therefore, the prevention of the IRI￾induced increase in lipid peroxidation and thus MDA by
remifentanil may in part be due to increased Bcl-2 or re￾duced Bax activity, which in turn may contribute to the
reduction of tissue injury and apoptosis.
Interestingly, remifentanil pretreatment significantly
decreased ischemia-reperfusion-induced oxidative stress
in the ileum, but not in the jejunum. This difference in
the pattern of MDA distribution between the proximal
and the distal sections of the gut suggests that jejunum
and ileum are not identical with regard to lipid peroxida￾tion and in their response to oxidative stress. Indeed,
such differences have been observed by others. For
instance, in a study of LPS-induced intestinal injury,
lipid peroxidation increased only in the ileum, not in the
jejunum [35]. Another study that investigated pharmaco￾logical preconditioning with isoflurane in intestinal IRI
also reported protection only of the ileum, not the
jejunum, thus concurring with our findings [36]. On the
other hand, in our opinion, it is rather unlikely that
there was no difference in oxidative stress at any time,
as IRI was histologically similar between the jejunum
and ileum (i.e. comparing the sham groups with the
IR-saline groups in both sections of the gut). It is

possible that the timepoint at which we sampled the gut
was not optimal to show differences that may occur at
an earlier or later time.
Inflammation is another important contributor to the
aggravation of IRI [19,37], and we measured IL-6 as a
marker of the inflammatory response [18,38]. The ability
of remifentanil to reduce IL-6 has been previously
reported in coronary artery bypass graft surgery and
open cholecystectomy [39,40]; however, reports on this
effect in the context of IRI are not abundant. One study
demonstrated that RPC reduced systemic IL-6 in IRI of
the heart [41], which is consistent with the data we re￾port here. The observation that RPC reduces systemic
IL-6 after intestinal IRI is remarkable, as the single-dose
RPC strategy protected not only the organ affected by
the ischemic insult, but also blunted the systemic in￾flammatory response. RPC may thus confer a potential
benefit regarding the systemic consequences of intestinal
injury, which are often severe and can include sepsis,
multi-organ failure and even death [42-45].
Opioids have been used as analgesics for centuries but it is
only in the last decade or so that they have been discovered
to also play a significant role in immunomodulation.
Although the immunomodulatory effects of remifentanil are
not as well studied as those of morphine and fentanyl,
current data suggest that its receptor-mediated effects are
not different from other μ-opioid agonists [46]. Immune cells
express functionally active opioid receptors on their surface,
and opioids have been shown to exert their effect directly via
these receptors [47,48]. Such effects include the inhibition of
the activity of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB), the prototyp￾ical upstream facilitator of IL-6 production [49]. For ex￾ample, chronic morphine treatment significantly impaired
the translocation of the NF-κB p65 and p50 transcription fac￾tors into the nuclear compartment of a variety of cells in a
model of lung infection [50]. Moreover, the opioid-induced
preconditioning signaling cascade has been reported to acti￾vate the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/Akt and the three
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways c-Jun
N-terminal kinase (JNK), p38 MAPK, and extracellular
signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2. Activation of these
signaling cascades in preconditioning has been linked
to pro-survival and anti-apoptotic effects [51-57]. Fur￾thermore, it is possible that such mild stimulation of
inflammatory pathways induces counter-regulatory
mechanisms such as the release of anti-inflammatory
cytokines and preconditions cells to reduce the impact
of a stronger consecutive stimulus. Such conditioning
cascades have been described for low doses of LPS that
protect against subsequent IRI [58,59].
Conclusion
Intestinal IRI is an important source of morbidity in a
number of clinical situations such as cardiac surgery,
vascular surgery, organ transplantation as well as
neonatal diseases such as necrotizing enterocolitis and
persistent ductus arteriosus. Our study has demon￾strated that a single bolus of remifentanil given before
tissue ischemia protects against IRI in the small intes￾tine, allowing us to bypass the inherent adverse effects
of conventional μ-opiods such as persistent inhibition of
gastrointestinal motility and respiratory drive. Based on
these findings, remifentanil is worthy of further mecha￾nistic and clinical investigation as a potential novel
pharmacological intervention strategy in ischemia￾reperfusion of the intestine and other organs.
