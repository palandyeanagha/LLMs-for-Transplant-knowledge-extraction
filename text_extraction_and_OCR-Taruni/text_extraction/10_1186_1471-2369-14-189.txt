Do higher dialysate calcium concentrations
increase vascular stiffness in haemodialysis
patients as measured by aortic pulse wave
velocity?
Evangelia Charitaki and Andrew Davenport*
Abstract
Background: Haemodialysis patients have an increased prevalence of hypertension and risk of cardiovascular
mortality and stroke. Higher dialysate calcium concentrations have been reported to cause both an acute and
chronic increase in arterial stiffness. We therefore looked at changes in arterial stiffness in established haemodialysis
patients to determine whether there was a threshold effect of dialysate calcium concentration linked to change in
arterial stiffness.
Methods: We performed pulse wave velocity measurements six months apart in patients dialysing with calcium
concentrations of 1.0, 1.25, 1.35 and ≥1.5 mmol/l.
Results: 289 patients, 62.2% male, mean age 65.5 ± 15.7 years, weight body mass index 25.8 ± 5.4 kg/m2 ,47.9%
diabetic were studied. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was 148.4 ± 28.6 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) 80.2 ±
15.5 mmHg. Mean pulse wave velocity increased over time (9.66 ± 2.0 vs 10.13 ± 2.16 m/s; p < 0.001), but there was no
change in aortic augmentation index (38.7 ± 16.3 vs 39.8 ± 15.6%) or central aortic pressure (149.6 ± 33.3 vs 150.4 ±
31.9 mmHg).
Pulse wave velocity did not differ between the four groups either at start or end of the study, but increased both in
the groups dialysing with a calcium concentration of 1.0 mmol/l (9.64 ± 1.94 vs 10.45 ± 1.98 m/s, p = 0.0028) and also
with 1.35 mmol/l (9.75 ± 1.96 vs 10.21 ± 2.18 m/s, p = 0.02).
Conclusions: Pulse wave velocity increased over the six months study. As pulse wave velocity increased in the group
dialysing using the lowest dialysate calcium, it is likely that factors, other than simple net calcium influx and efflux
during dialysis according to dialysate calcium concentration are involved with vascular stiffening.

Background
Although haemodialysis is an established outpatient treat￾ment for patients with chronic kidney disease, mortality, in
particular cardiovascular mortality, remains high. Whereas
atheromatous coronary artery disease is the predominant
cardiovascular risk factor for the general population, arterio￾sclerosis is more commonly found in the haemodialysis pa￾tient, leading to increased risk of sudden cardiac arrhythmic
death, heart failure and stroke [1].
Vascular calcification, in particular medial calcification, is
more common in haemodialysis patients, and although the
pathogenesis of soft tissue calcification is multifactorial, it
has been suggested that repeated episodes of hypercalcaemia
can increase the risk of vascular calcification [2].
Calcification of major arteries increases arterial stiffness
and pulse wave velocity. Increased aortic stiffness and the
associated elevated pulse pressure in central arteries has
been shown to be a strong and independent predictor of
cardiovascular events in both the general population and
also patients with chronic kidney disease [3]. Several small
studies have reported that pulse wave velocity can increase

following a single haemodialysis treatment when using a
higher dialysate calcium concentration compared to a
lower concentration [4,5]. Dialysing against higher dialys￾ate calcium concentrations leads to greater prevalence of
hypercalcaemia [6], and other small studies have reported
that pulse wave velocity increases over time in both
haemodialysis [7-9] and peritoneal dialysis patients [10]
dialysed using higher dialysate calcium concentrations
than lower. Currently there is no consensus on the
optimum dialysate calcium concentration [11], and we
reviewed pulse wave velocity changes in a cohort of
chronic haemodialysis patients dialysed with various cal￾cium concentrations to determine whether there were any
discernible changes over time.
Methods
289 adult patients who had pulse wave velocity (PWV)
measurements predialysis 6 months apart and had contin￾ued to dialyse with the same dialysate calcium concentra￾tion were reviewed. Aortic-brachial pulse wave velocity was
measured using the Tensio Clinic Ateriograph (TensioMed
Kft., Budapest, Hungary) an applanation oscillometric de￾vice which has been validated against direct invasive mea￾surements [12]. The distance between jugular notch and
symphysis pubis was measured with either the patient
standing upright, or lying flat using a specially designed and
adjustable calibrated caliper. Pulse wave velocity measure￾ments were subsequently made in the recumbent position
in the non-fistula arm after patients had rested for a mini￾mum of 10 minutes, using the appropriate sized cuff for
the patients’s arm . Patients were advised not to take ni￾trates prior to measurement of pulse wave velocity. PWV
measurements were not able to be recorded in patients
with atrial fibrillation, other arrhythmias, those with fistulae
in both arms, and patients with no recordable upper arm
blood pressure recordings. Augmentation indices (AXi)
were calculated for the aorta (AoAXi) and brachial arteries
(BrAXi) as the difference between the amplitudes of the late
(backward) systolic wave (P2) and the early (forward) sys￾tolic wave (P1) over the pulse pressure (PP) and multiplied
with 100. AXi = (P2-P1)/PP x100, and adjusted for heart
rate. Diastolic relaxation area (DRA), a measure of diastolic
filling of the left coronary artery was measured and then
adjusted for heart rate. Three inflations of the brachial ar￾terial cuff were recorded, and if the pulse wave velocity dif￾fered by >0.5 m/s, the reading was repeated, and mean
value recorded.
Patients were dialysed thrice weekly, targeted to
achieve an on-line clearance of ≥1.4 (Fresenius 4008/
5008, Fresenius Bad Homberg, Germany, Dialog+, B
Braun Medical Inc, Melsungen, Germany), mean session
time 3.96 ± 0.38 hours, using polysulfone dialyzers (Nipro,
Osaka, Japan) [13] with ultrapure quality dialysate, and
anticoagulated with tinzaparin (Leo Laboratories, Market
Harborough, UK) [14]. 77.4% of patients dialysed using an
arterio-venous fistula.
Biochemical investigations were performed using stand￾ard automated multichannel analyser, with albumin mea￾sured by the bromcresol green method (Roche Integra,
Roche diagnostics, Lewes, UK). Hypotensive episodes dur￾ing dialysis requiring changing ultrafiltration rates and
intravenous fluid administration were recorded. Standard
2 dimensional echocardiograms were performed on a
non-dialysis day (Philips IE33, Philips Medical Systems,
Eindhoven, Netherlands).
This retrospective audit complied with the UK NHS
guidelines for audit and clinical service development. Meas￾urement of pulse wave velocity was introduced into clinical
practice in 2011 and measured as part of an audit of blood
pressure control in haemodialysis patients. Echocardio￾grams were performed as part of transplant assessment.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis used paired students’ t test and Wilcoxon
rank sum pair tests for analysis of the whole study cohort
(GraphPad Prism version 6.0, San Diego, USA), and by Chi
square and one way anova with Tukey post hoc analysis
correction, for intergroup analysis (SPSS version 17.0, SPSS
Inc, Univ Chicago, Illinois, USA). Data are expressed as
mean ± standard deviation, median and inter-quartile range,
or percentages. Statistical significance was taken at or below
the 5% level.
Results
Data was available on 289 patients, 62.2% male, mean age
65.5 ± 15.7 years, weight 71.4 ± 16.7 kg, body mass index
25.8 ± 5.4 kg/m2 and 47.9% diabetic. 79.5% had a past
medical history of hypertension, 29.2% ischaemic heart
disease, 19.1% peripheral vascular disease, 14.1% cerebro￾vascular disease and 5.6% had previous parathyroidec￾tomy. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) 148.4 ± 28.6 mmHg,
diastolic blood pressure (DBP) 80.2 ± 15.5 mmHg, with
28.6% prescribed angiotensin converting enzyme inhibi￾tors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs),
27.2% beta-blockers and 20.9% calcium channel blockers.
Serum albumin was 39.7 ± 3.9 g/l, calcium 2.27 ±
0.17 mmol/l, corrected calcium 2.44 ± 0.16 mmol/l,
phosphate 1.48 ± 0.48 mmol/l, alkaline phosphatase 97
(72–135) Iu/l and parathyroid hormone (PTH) 26.8
(13.9-53.5) pmol/l. Median weekly dose of calcitriol pre￾scribed was 2 (0.75-4.5) ug, with 52.9% prescribed cal￾cium containing phosphate binders, 15.6% sevelamer,
13.9% lanthanum carbonate and 7.6% cinacalcet. Serum
total cholesterol (TChol) was 3.97 ± 1.1 mmol/l, high
density lipoprotein (HDL) 1.27 ± 0.48, low density lipo￾protein (LDL) 2.0 ± 0.9 mmol/l and triglycerides 1.3
(0.9-1.9) mmol/l, with 58.2% prescribed HMG CoA 3
reductase inhibitors (statin).

Mean pulse wave velocity increased over time (9.66 ± 2.0
vs 10.13 ± 2.16 m/s ,p < 0.001), but there was no change in
aortic augmentation index (38.7 ± 16.3 vs 39.8 ± 15.6%), or
central aortic pressure (149.6 ± 33.3 vs 150.4 ± 31.9 mmHg).
As this an audit of clinical practice and not a prospect￾ive trial a range of dialysate calcium concentrations were
used with different numbers of patients using each of the
diaysates, with 18.8% patients using a dialysate calcium
concentration of 1.0 mmol/l, 20.9% 1.25 mmol/l, 53%
1.35 mmol/l, 5.9% 1.5 mmol/l and 1.4% 1.75 mmol/l re￾spectively. The groups were well matched for demograph￾ics and serum biochemistries (Tables 1 and 2), although
more of the cohort dialysing with the lowest calcium dialys￾ate concentration had a history or previous hypertension,
higher serum phosphate and parathyroid levels, and were
prescribed more oral calcium based phosphate binders and
sevelamer hydrochloride, compared to those dialysing
against the highest dialysate calcium concentrations.
Peripheral and central blood pressure measurements
were not different between the calcium dialysate cohorts, at
baseline or after six months, there were no differences in
antihypertensive medication prescription, and similarly no
significant differences were observed on follow up after
6 months (Table 3). In addition, there were no differences
at baseline or on follow up of pulse wave velocity, or pulse
wave velocity derived parameters, augmentation indices, or
diastolic relaxation index between the groups. Simple
paired t testing showed significant increases in pulse wave
velocity for the 1.0 mmol/l calcium dialysate (9.64 ± 1.94 vs
10.45 ± 1.98 m/s, p = 0.028) and 1.35 mmol/l calcium
dialysate (9.75 ± 1.96 vs 10.21 ± 2.18 m/s, p = 0.02)
groups, but not for the other two groups (Figure 1).
Echocardiograms were available for review from 31 pa￾tients dialysing with calcium dialysate 1.0 mmol/l, 34
using 1.25 mmol/l, 106 using 1.35 mmol/l, and 16 dia￾lysing with calcium ≥1.75 mmol/l. There were no differ￾ences in echocardiogram derived ejection fraction, left
ventricular end diastolic diameter, intra-ventricular sep￾tal wall thickness, or left ventricular posterior wall
thickness between the subsets of patients (Table 3).
Recorded episodes of symptomatic intradialytic hypo￾tension were greater on follow up for those dialysing
against the lowest calcium dialysate, but there were no
differences when episodes were averaged between the
two pulse wave velocity measurements (Table 3).
Discussion
Over the last decade there has been increased recognition
of the clinical importance of vascular stiffness in dialysis
patients due to both the high prevalence of hypertension
in the dialysis patient with increased risk of stroke on one
hand [15], and episodes of intradialytic hypotension [16],
potentially compromising cardiac [17] and cerebral perfu￾sion [18] on the other. Many studies have reported an as￾sociation between vascular calcification and vascular
stiffness in dialysis patients and increasing mortality [2].
In our cohort there was a small but statistically significant
increase in pulse wave velocity over the six month period,
but no change in blood pressure, augmentation index, or
other derived parameters.

Previous small series comparing dialysate calcium
concentrations of 1.0, 1.25 and 1.5 mmol/l, have sug￾gested that using higher dialysate calcium concentra￾tion for a single haemodialysis session, can increase
vascular stiffness measured by pulse wave velocity with
a reduction in augmentation index [4]. This was sup￾ported by another study reporting increased pulse
wave velocity using a 1.75 mmol/l dialysate calcium
compared to 1.25 mmol/l [5]. The question arises as to
whether these effects are simply due to temporary
changes in calcium flux during dialysis affecting vascular
reactivity, since higher dialysate calcium concentrations
lead to a net influx of calcium during dialysis [19], and so
reduce the incidence of intradialytic hypotension com￾pared to lower concentrations [20]. In addition, other
studies have reported changes in pulse wave velocity over
six months when using higher dialysate calcium concen￾trations, both in peritoneal [10] and haemodialysis pa￾tients [8]. It is generally accepted that dialysate calcium
concentrations of 1.25 mmol/l or less will usually lead to
a net loss of calcium during a dialysis session, and those
equal to greater than 1.5 mmol/l to a net gain [11], al￾though it has been argued that even at 1.25 mmol/l there
may theoretically be a calcium gain, and even calcium di￾alysate concentrations as low as 1.0 mmol/l may have
neutral calcium balance [19]. Nevertheless, it is likely
that repeated exposure to increased calcium gains may
lead to increased microcrystal formation with resultant
vascular calcification and aortic stiffness [20]. As such,
we reviewed patients who had pulse wave velocity mea￾surements six months apart using a device which has
been validated against direct invasive measurements
[12], and measuring the time between the first-direct and
second-reflected wave, the time required for the wave to
travel from the aortic root to the bifurcation and return
and the distance travelled. This device does not overesti￾mate pulse wave velocity as found with some carotid￾femoral pulse wave velocity devices due to the effects of
changes in velocity in muscular arteries.
Pulse wave velocity is well known to be affected by
systolic hypertension, age, sex, body mass index and co￾morbid conditions including type 2 diabetes. As this
was an audit of clinical practice, a range of dialysate cal￾cium concentrations were used by differing numbers of
patients. However despite this, our groups were well
matched for those demographic factors which affect
pulse wave velocity and baseline blood pressure. Unlike
the previous reports, typically of 30 patients or fewer,
we studied almost 290 patients, divided into 4 groups
according to dialysate calcium concentrations. Whereas
previous reports have observed increases in aortic stiff￾ness comparing calcium dialysates of 1.0, 1.25 and

1.50 mmol/l [8]; 1.25 and 1.75 [5]; 1.5 and 1.75 [7]; and
a reduction in pulse wave velocity following a reduction
in dialysate calcium from 1.75 to 1.5 mmol/l [9], we
were unable to demonstrate any differences between pa￾tients dialysing with calcium dialysate concentrations
1.0, 1.25, 1.35 and ≥1.5 mmol/l. There was a trend for
pulse wave velocity to increase over time, which was sta￾tistically significant for those patients dialysing against a
calcium dialysate of 1.0 mmol/l, and 1.35 mmol/l, but
not the highest dialysate calcium concentrations. This
may have simply been due to the relatively small num￾ber of patients dialysing with the highest dialysate cal￾cium concentrations. Compared to previous reports the
difference with our findings may have been due to the
smaller numbers studied in earlier reports, coupled with
selection bias and differences in pulse wave velocity
measuring devices, particularly when the femoral artery
was used. On the other hand our findings are in keeping
with previous studies which observed no differences in
central pulse pressure, carotid-radial pulse wave vel￾ocity, central or brachial augmentation indices [8]. Simi￾larly others have not shown any change in aortic
stiffness or pulse wave velocity with different dialysate
calcium concentrations during a single dialysis session,
with changes in blood pressure ascribed to changes in
stroke volume [21].
As with other reports, patients dialysing against
lower dialysate calcium had higher serum phosphate

and parathyroid concentrations compared to those using
higher dialysate calcium concentrations [22]. Although pa￾tients dialysing against the highest dialysate calcium concen￾trations were prescribed more calcium based phosphate
binders, those dialysing against the lowest were prescribed
more active vitamin D analogues, and more likely to be pre￾scribed cinacalcet. We have no formal dietary information
as to dietary calcium intakes, or assessment of patient com￾pliance with prescribed phosphate binders and cinacalcet, al￾though active vitamin D analogues were administered with
dialysis sessions. As all patients were given the same stand￾ard dietary advice and dieticians working to achieve the
same standards [23], it is likely that dietary calcium intake
was similar, and certainly not greater in the lower dialysate
calcium groups, such that any effect of dialysate calcium
concentration would have been obscured by corresponding
changes in dietary calcium. In addition as the group dialys￾ing against the lowest dialysate calcium concentration were
prescribed less calcium based phosphate binders, and more
likely to be prescribed a non-calcium containing phosphate
binder it supports our findings that the choice of dialysate
calcium concentration does not affect pulse wave velocity in
the short term.
In this study although there was a small but significant
increase in pulse wave velocity for the whole cohort, we
were unable to demonstrate any major difference in blood
pressure, pulse wave velocity or derived indices according
to calcium containing dialysates over a six month period.
As our report is an audit of clinical practice, rather than a
prospective trial, it was not designed to identify which fac￾tors were responsible for the increase observed. Although
calcium containing microparticles are key to the initiation
of soft tissue vascular calcification, the propensity for
vascular calcification is somewhat more complex than
simply reflecting changes in calcium influx and efflux
during a dialysis session at the macro level. We were
unable to demonstrate any differences in pulse wave
velocity over 6 months associated with different dialys￾ate calcium concentrations.
Conclusions
Our findings however, do not imply that higher dialysate
calcium concentrations cannot result in changes in vascu￾lar stiffness in the longer term as we investigated changes
for only six months, and the differences in pulse wave vel￾ocity were small. Although our study may have been too
short a period to demonstrate any measurable differences
of different calcium dialysates, the increase in pulse wave
velocity observed over time with the lowest calcium di￾alysate group does suggest that factors other than dialysate
calcium may be more important in determining vascular
stiffness in haemodialysis patients.
