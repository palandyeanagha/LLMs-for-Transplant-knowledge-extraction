P
rognosis in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) depends critically
on early diagnosis and timely treatment with immune
modulating drugs. As a consequence, early referral and
access of patients with suspected RA to rheumatologists is
mandatory for the establishment of diagnosis and initiation
of treatment.
Measurement of antibodies to cyclic citrullinated peptide
(CCP) is a new and highly specific test for the diagnosis of
RA. Detection of anti-CCP antibodies—in particular, if the
second generation of anti-CCP2 tests is used—has been
shown to be of prognostic significance and to be helpful in
early diagnosis of RA.1–9
The goal of this work was to investigate whether the
measurement of anti-CCP antibodies alone or in combination
with easily determinable parameters of a patient’s complaints
and routine laboratory tests might help to identify prospec￾tively patients with a high probability for RA.
For this study 102 patients from a routine rheumatology
clinic were examined. All were referred by general practi￾tioners, orthopaedic surgeons, or other non-rheumatological
subspecialties because of suspected RA. In all patients the
value of the anti-CCP antibody (second generation anti￾CCP2-test; Euroimmun, Lu¨beck, Germany), IgM rheumatoid
factor (RF, as determined by nephelometry; Beckman
Coulter, Krefeld, Germany), C reactive protein (CRP), and
erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were measured, and
physical, laboratory, and radiological examinations were
performed. RA was diagnosed according to the American
College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria revised in 1987.10 All
patients were questioned about the presence of morning
stiffness of the joints and or muscles and about the presence
of polyarticular pain, which was interpreted as positive if at
least four tender joints were reported.
Sensitivity and specificity and—to obtain better informa￾tion about the diagnostic value with a low pretest prob￾ability—the positive and negative predictive values (PPV and
NPV) of the tests were calculated. For the latter, the
following formulae were used:
PPV = a/(a+b); NPV = d/(c+d)
where a = test positive, disease positive; b = test positive,
disease negative; c = test negative, disease positive; d = test
negative, disease negative.
Moreover, the relative risk of fulfilling the ACR criteria for
RA, whether or not the test criteria were present, was
determined.
Twenty eight of the 102 patients fulfilled the diagnosis of
RA according to the ACR criteria (pretest probability of
27%).10 The other patients were classified as having unclassi￾fied monarthritis, polyarthritis, or oligoarthritis (n = 21),
arthralgias of unknown origin (n = 20), osteoarthritis of the
fingers (n = 20), psoriatic arthritis (n = 4), fibromyalgia
(n = 3), polymyalgia rheumatica (n = 2), cervicobrachialgia
(n = 2), periostitis (n = 1), and reactive arthritis (n = 1).
If a patient was positive for anti-CCP, the PPV, or in other
words the probability of fulfilling the ACR criteria for RA,
increased to 55% (table 1).
This relatively low predictive value of the anti-CCP test was
increased when it was combined with easily obtainable

combination with different laboratory parameters and patient’s complaints for the

RF plus morning stiffness 30 97 80 78 3.7 2.2 to 6.0
The results of the positive predictive value (PPV) are highlighted. The patient group tested comprised 102 patients
with suspected RA who were referred to a rheumatologist. Twenty eight of them fulfilled the ACR criteria for RA
(pretest probability of 27%).
PPV, positive predictive value; NPV, negative predictive value; RR, relative risk; 95% CI, 95% confidence interval for
relative risk; anti-CCP, anti-CCP values above normal (,2 U/l); RF, rheumatoid factor above normal (,10 U/l);
CRP, C reactive protein value above normal (,5 mg/l), ESR, erythrocyte sedimentation rate .20 mm/1st h;
morning stiffness, morning stiffness of at least 60 minutes; polyarticular pain, pain in at least four joints or muscular
regions.

information about the patient’s complaints: if a patient had a
positive anti-CCP test and at the same time morning stiffness
of at least 60 min the PPV was 89%. In fact, the only patient
who was positive for both measures without fulfilling the
ACR criteria for RA was thought by the examining
rheumatologist to have early RA. Polyarticular pain is a
symptom which was present in all patients with RA and,
additionally, in the patients with arthralgias, undifferen￾tiated polyarthritis, fibromyalgia and polymyalgia rheuma￾tica. If anti-CCP positive patients had polyarticular pain, a
PPV of 78% and a NPV of 81% was obtained. In contrast, the
combination of anti-CCP and RF, as was suggested by other
reports,2 9 did not result in a similar increase of the PPV or
NPV (59% and 79%, respectively). The rather low sensitivity
and specificity of the anti-CCP test (table 1) was in
accordance with other reports with similar results obtained
in unselected rheumatological patients who were not sub￾jected to a prolonged follow up.11
In conclusion, if information about morning stiffness of
the joints or polyarticular pain is added, anti-CCP gives us a
tool which more accurately predicts the presence of RA. This
tool might be important to identify patients with early RA
and facilitate a more precise selection of patients for rapid
access to rheumatologists.

Safety of 15-deoxyspergualin in the treatment of
glomerulonephritis associated with active systemic lupus
erythematosus

Optimal treatment for patients with relapsing lupus
nephritis remains unclear. The ability of 15-deoxy￾spergualin (gusperimus; 15-DSG) to suppress sys￾temic lupus erythematosus (SLE)-like diseases has been
demonstrated in animals and humans.1–4 15-DSG exerted no
nephrotoxicity or hepatotoxicity but reversibly induced
leucocytopenia.5 6
In this study we aimed at evaluating the safety of 15-DSG
in the treatment of glomerulonephritis associated with SLE.
CASE REPORTS
Table 1 shows the patient characteristics.
15-DSG was provided by Nippon Kayaku Co Ltd, Tokyo,
Japan. Patients gave their informed consent, and 15-DSG
0.5 mg/kg normal body weight (height in cm minus 100)/day
was self administered subcutaneously for 14 days, followed
by a break of 7 days ( = 1 cycle). The dose was adjusted
(dependent on efficacy or safety, or both) after cycles 4 and 6
to 0.35 mg/kg and 0.25 mg/kg, or 0.7 mg/kg and 1.0 mg/kg.
Patient 1
After a bolus, daily corticosteroids could be decreased to 5 mg
after 9 weeks. The patient received six cycles of 15-DSG
without major problems. Leucocyte counts were always
.46109 cells/l, no infection was seen, no (serious) adverse
events and occurred with the exception of parageusia. GN
resolved and her SLE associated activity measures improved
(table 1, fig 1). After the sixth cycle the patient was switched
from 15-DSG to a combination of ciclosporin A (CSA) and
azathioprine, and later azathioprine alone. Renal function
was normal at the end of the trial, SELENA-SLEDAI (Safety
of Oestrogens in Lupus Erythematosus National Assessment￾SLE Disease Activity Index) decreased from 12 to 0, and the
corticosteroid dosage was reduced to 5 mg/day.

Patient 2
Oral corticosteroids were increased to 40 mg/day and tapered
to 5 mg/day within 9 weeks. Proteinuria decreased to 700–
750 mg/day (fig 1; table 1). During the second cycle, she had
herpes zoster exanthema (which completely disappeared
after treatment with antiviral agents). The white blood cell
count was always .56109 cells/l. Because dsDNA antibody
titres remained high, the 15-DSG dosage was increased to
0.75 mg/kg/day for cycles 5 and 6, to 1.0 mg/kg/day for cycles
7–9. During cycle 5 she experienced bacterial bronchitis
without fever. At the end of cycle 6 her anaemia worsened
(possibly 15-DSG-related?).7 Within the ninth cycle, for the
first time during treatment with 15-DSG, the urine sediment
indicated a flare of GN. At this time, proteinuria was 890 mg/
day (fig 1); creatinine was always normal. SELENA-SLEDAI
decreased from 12 to 4 (end of cycle 8). The corticosteroid
dosage was 5 mg/day at the end of the study.
Treatment was switched to 150 mg oral cyclophosphamide.
During her last visit to our clinic the anaemia had improved
(115 g/l), proteinuria was stable (1100 mg/day), and ery￾throcyturia was present without signs of active GN.
Patient 3
After a bolus, corticosteroids could be tapered to 5 mg/day
(end of cycle 3). Maximum proteinuria was 10 300 mg/day at
entry into 15-DSG treatment (fig 1; table 1). By the end of
cycle 3, proteinuria had decreased to ,1000 mg/day (fig 1).
Within cycles 3 and 4 she had a prolonged urogenital
infection, possibly related to leucocytopenia (3.96109 cells/l
at the end of cycle 3, 1.76109 cells/l at the end of cycle 4). She
now experienced a flare of her GN (increased proteinuria up
to 7100 mg/day at the end of cycle 5; fig 1). We increased the
corticosteroids to 60 mg/day, continued 15-DSG as previous
success was excellent, but decreased the dosage to 0.35 mg/
kg/day because of (possibly 15-DSG-related?) leucocytopenia
and the infectious episodes. In addition, we prescribed low
dose CSA (2.5 mg/kg/day) as 15-DSG had been successfully
used together with CSA.8 Subsequently, corticosteroids could
be tapered to 5 mg/day within 7 weeks. Proteinuria
decreased to 780 mg/day (cycle 9; fig 1); creatinine was
always normal. No infections were reported during the 15-
DSG + CSA treatment. She is now receiving CSA alone.
SELENA-SLEDAI decreased from 14 to 6; the corticosteroid
dosage was reduced to 5 mg/day at the end of the study.
CONCLUSION
As far as we know, this is the first report on safety of 15-DSG
in the treatment of active SLE-GN. Two of the three patients
had non-severe infectious episodes, but otherwise 15-DSG
was well tolerated. We are currently conducting a phase I/II
trial with 15-DSG in patients with SLE and active GN which
will also focus on efficacy measurement.
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
We thank our patients for their collaboration and help in performing
this trial.

Autoimmune hepatitis associated with infliximab in a patient
with psoriatic arthritis
V Germano, A Picchianti Diamanti, G Baccano, E Natale, A Onetti Muda, R Priori, G Valesini
...............................................................................................................................
Ann Rheum Dis 2005;64:1519–1520. doi: 10.1136/ard.2004.032821
We read with interest the debate about liver toxicity of
infliximab in psoriatic arthritis (PsA).1 2 We describe
the case of a 53 year old woman with a 4 year
history of refractory PsA who developed transaminasitis
during infliximab treatment.
CASE REPORT
Despite combination treatment (ciclosporin 300 mg/day,
fluocortolone 10 mg/day, and methotrexate (MTX)15 mg/
week intramuscularly), disease activity was still high, and
intravenous infliximab at 3 mg/kg was administered initially
at weeks 0, 2, 6, 14 and then every 6 weeks. Ciclosporin was
withdrawn.
Within 3 weeks she improved, fluocortolone was gradually
stopped while methotrexate (MTX) 20 mg/week intramuscu￾larly, was continued. After the sixth infusion, she developed a
mild transaminasitis and MTX, initially tapered, was stopped.
After the eighth infusion transaminases continued to rise and
in the absence of any other plausible cause, infliximab was
withdrawn.
She was admitted to our department with persistently high
values of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine amino￾transferase and a flare of PsA.
The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 30 mm/1st h, C
reactive protein 170 mg/l, aspartate aminotransferase 143 IU
(normal 5–40), alanine aminotransferase 234 IU (normal 5–
55), anti-parietal cell antibodies and liver and kidney
microsomal antigen were absent, and serology for hepatitis
viruses, cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus, was
negative. The new appearance of anti-dsDNA (IgG) 1/20
(indirect immunofluorescence on Crithidia luciliae), anti￾smooth muscle antibodies (ASMA) 1/640 was observed,
while the titre of antinuclear antibodies (ANA), previously
present at a serum dilution of 1/80, increased to 1/160. Liver
ultrasonography showed steatosis. A liver biopsy revealed
intense and diffuse portal lymphoplasmacytic, granulocytic
inflammatory infiltration and severe interface hepatitis. Mild
periportal fibrosis was also evident (figs 1A and B).
Fluocortolone 20 mg daily was started and the joints
improved. Within a few months, transaminases declined
and finally normalised; ANA remained positive, while anti￾dsDNA and ASMA disappeared.
DISCUSSION
Feletar et al found a high incidence of liver toxicity in patients
with PsA treated with infliximab,1 even if, as Provenzano
pointed out,2 in some cases this association was debatable
because of the concomitant use of MTX and the lack of
exclusion of viral infections. In one of the largest studies on
the use of infliximab in rheumatoid arthritis (RA),3 no liver
disease was recorded, but recently two possible cases of liver
disease associated with infliximab use have been observed in
Crohn’s disease and PsA.4 5 In our patient the chronological
relationship between transaminasitis and treatment (fig 2),
linked to the peculiar histology, is suggestive of autoimmune
hepatitis induced by infliximab. The high titre of ASMA,
notoriously associated with autoimmune hepatitis,6 supports
this hypothesis.
Our patient was concomitantly treated with MTX for
almost 30 weeks. MTX can produce steatosis, fibrosis and,
ultimately, cirrhosis; its hepatotoxicity in psoriasis is well
known. A 2.5–5.0-fold increase in liver damage for psoriasis
compared with RA has been reported.7
Moreover, patients with PsA seem more prone to liver
toxicity during infliximab treatment than those with RA.1 A
dissimilar toxicity profile for disease modifying antirheu￾matic drugs in various diseases has been linked to differences
in pathophysiology, genetic background, drinking behaviour,
and age.

However, our patient had received less than a third
(900 mg in the past 4 years) of the cumulative dose known
to be a risk for hepatic toxicity.8 In this case, infliximab might
have led to the acute damage—that is, severe portal
inflammation and initial neoductulogenesis, whereas MTX
might have been responsible for the chronic hepatic injury—
that is, mild fibrosis and steatosis. The introduction of
corticosteroids probably hastened liver recovery with sub￾sequent normalisation of transaminases.
The appearance of autoantibodies, occasionally associated
with mild and transitory autoimmune diseases, during anti￾tumour necrosis factor a treatment has been documented1 9
and reflects the complex relationship between tumour
necrosis factor a blockage and autoimmunity. This report
confirms the need to monitor liver enzymes carefully and
perform liver biopsy, if necessary, not only in patients with
PsA using combination treatment with MTX and infliximab
but also for those using infliximab alone, especially in the
presence of pre-existent serological signs of autoimmunity
such as ANA. Such signs might be a risk factor for further
development of clinical autoimmunity during infliximab
treatment.

Alleviation of polyarticular syndrome in multicentric
reticulohistiocytosis with intravenous zoledronate
C P Mavragani, K Batziou, K Aroni, D Pikazis, M N Manoussakis
...............................................................................................................................
Ann Rheum Dis 2005;64:1521–1522. doi: 10.1136/ard.2004.032433
A67 year old previously healthy women presented with
a 12 month history of generalised symmetric arthral￾gias and bilateral hand contractures. Her past medical
history was unremarkable, except for heavy smoking.
On physical examination, she had tight incapacitating
flexion contractures of both hands, and small cutaneous non￾tender well circumscribed nodules (3–6 mm diameter) on the
dorsum of the fingers and over the proximal and distal
interphalangeal joints (fig 1). A symmetric polyarthritis
affecting the shoulders, elbows, proximal and distal inter￾phalangeal joints, and the knees was prominent. Blood
counts, biochemical profile and inflammatory markers, anti￾nuclear antibodies, and rheumatoid factor were within
normal limits. A hand x ray examination showed erosive
deforming arthropathy of the styloid processes. Biopsy
samples of a skin nodule and of synovial membrane disclosed
infiltrates of multinucleated giant cells and histiocytes,
indicative of multicentric reticulohistiocytosis (MRH). The
infiltrating histiocytes were macrophages, as illustrated by
positive staining for CD68 marker and negative staining for
S-100 (Langerhans’ dendritic cell marker) and HHF-35 actin
(fibroblast marker).
The well described association of MRH with malignan￾cies1 2 had prompted the screening for underlying malig￾nancies, which disclosed a 10-fold increase of CA-125. A
pelvic computed tomographic scan was normal; however,
magnetic resonance imaging showed the presence of a small
well circumscribed mass at the left parametrial space, which
was subsequently removed by laparotomy and diagnosed as
poorly differentiated ovarian adenocarcinoma without meta￾static spread. The patient was given intravenous combination
treatment of carbaplatine and cyclophosphamide.
Three months later, the cutaneous nodules resolved, but
the polyarthritis persisted and the patient gradually devel￾oped a generalised painful stiffness of the trunk and
extremities, which required the use of narcotic analgesics
and confined her to bed. Intravenous methylprednisolone
pulses were also administered, without response. Based on
the recently reported effectiveness of intravenous alendro￾nate for MRH,3 zoledronate (4 mg) was given intravenously,
because alendronate was unavailable locally. Two weeks
later, the stiffness and arthralgias were dramatically reduced.
The patient is now completely free of pain and ambulatory.
DISCUSSION
MRH is a rare disorder of unknown cause, characterised by
destructive symmetric arthritis associated with cutaneous
papulonodular lesions. In about one third of patients,
musculoskeletal symptoms may precede or follow an under￾lying malignancy (such as breast and ovarian cancer,
melanoma or mesothelioma).2 MRH should be differentiated
from fibroblastic rheumatism, which is also rare.4 Although
strict differentiating histological criteria are lacking, multi￾nucleated foreign body-type giant cells appear to denote
MRH, whereas the predominance of myofibroblasts and
excessive collagen production characterises fibroblastic rheu￾matism.5 The inclusion of fibroblastic rheumatism in the
broader spectrum of non-Langerhans’ cell histiocytosis has
been recently proposed.6
To date, the decision for systemic therapeutic intervention
in MRH remains largely empirical. Treatment with steroids
and various cytotoxic agents is of questionable efficacy,2 and
in our patient it resulted only in resolution of the cutaneous
nodules. Recently, the beneficial role of tumour necrosis
factor blockers has been suggested7
; however, these are
contraindicated in patients with concomitant neoplasia.
Intravenous alendronate has been also advocated in the
management of MRH.4 In our patient, the administration of
the parenteral bisphosphonate zoledronate, so far used for
the treatment of osteoporosis8 and of hypercalcaemia of
malignancy,9 dramatically alleviated the incapacitating joint
symptoms.
The precise mechanism of bisphosphonate action on MRH
is unclear. However, after intravenous injection, bisphos￾phonates have been previously shown to deposit in the
reticuloendothelial system,10 to inhibit the metalloprotease
activity and matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression of infil￾trating macrophages,11 and to induce apoptosis of macro￾phage-like cells.12 Therefore, one may speculate that their
favourable effect in MRH is due to the inhibition of tissue
infiltration by histiocytes, possibly through induction of
apoptosis.

Acetaminophen may act through b endorphin
H Sprott, H Shen, S Gay, A Aeschlimann
...............................................................................................................................
Ann Rheum Dis 2005;64:1522. doi: 10.1136/ard.2004.033712
Acetaminophen, also known as paracetamol, is a non￾steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with potent
antipyretic and analgesic actions but with very weak
anti-inflammatory activity. The mechanism of action of
acetaminophen is still not clearly understood. It has no
known endogenous high affinity binding sites. In addition,
acetaminophen does not appear to share with NSAIDs the
ability to inhibit peripheral cyclo-oxygenase (COX) activity.1
Although various biochemical studies point to inhibition of
central COX-2 activity, the existence of a COX activity that is
selectively susceptible to acetaminophen (COX-3?) is an
alternative hypothesis.2 However, this may hold true only for
the dog. Database analysis of human COX-1 showed a frame
shift induced by intron 1, possibly showing COX-3 to be a
virtual protein in humans.3
Our studies in osteoarthritis provide evidence of a clear
effect of acetaminophen on b endorphin levels in plasma
(fig 1) compared with rofecoxib 25 mg/day.4 Plasma b
endorphin levels decreased in 10 patients with osteoarthritis
after 1 month of treatment with up to 4 g/day acetamino￾phen orally (p = 0.017) as well as after 3 months of
treatment (p = 0.028). Whereas, there were no changes in
the rofecoxib group after 1 month (p = 0.73) and 3 months
(p = 1.00), respectively.
Acetaminophen may play a part in the delivery of
peripheral b endorphin to their receptors and thereby relieve
pain.

Refractory adult onset Still’s disease and
hypersensitivity to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs and cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors: are
biological agents the solution?
E H J G Aarntzen, P L C M van Riel, P Barrera
...............................................................................................................................
Ann Rheum Dis 2005;64:1523–1524. doi: 10.1136/ard.2005.042945
Adult onset Still’s disease (AOSD) is an autoimmune
disorder characterised by periodic high fever, arthritis,
and typical evanescent rashes. Non-steroidal anti￾inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the preferred treatment.
In severe cases several disease modifying antirheumatic
drugs, thalidomide, and intravenous immunoglobulin have
been used. More recently, successful treatment with tumour
necrosis factor a (TNFa) blocking agents1 2 and interleukin
(IL) 1 neutralisation3 has also been reported.
Hypersensitivity to NSAIDs, often characterised by urti￾caria, angio-oedema, and asthma, has been well documented,
and several studies indicate that anaphylactic reactions are
related to the inhibition of cyclo-oxygenase-1 (COX-1)
enzyme4–6 and that selective COX-2 inhibitors can be safe in
these patients. Here we report a case of AOSD complicated by
coexisting hypersensitivity to acetaminophen (paracetamol),
aspirin, NSAIDs, and also to selective COX-2 inhibitors. TNFa
neutralisation controlled the fever, but not the AOSD related
rashes and polyarthritis or the anaphylactic reactions to
NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors. Treatment with IL1 receptor
antagonist led to full remission of the AOSD.
CASE REPORT
A patient, with known AOSD for 22 years, was admitted to
our centre with a 3 week history of spiking high fever, chills,
skin rash, cough, and a sore throat. Physical examination
disclosed a typical AOSD related rash, polyarthritis, and
enlarged inguinal lymph nodes without hepatosplenomegaly.
Laboratory examination showed an increased acute phase
reaction and a normochromic normocytic anaemia; white
blood cell count, platelet count, and liver function tests were
normal. Serological tests for viral infections, toxoplasma,
Bartonella, blood and urine culture rheumatoid factor, and
antinuclear antibodies were all negative.
In the past the AOSD had followed a polycyclic course, which
had been successfully treated with several NSAIDs alone or in
combination with acetaminophen for 10 years. In 1993, she
developed an allergic reaction with angio-oedema to naproxen
(fig 1), and later also to acetaminophen and sodium salicylate.
Methotrexate was used for the next 10 years, but frequently
corticosteroids were needed to treat the AOSD exacerbations. To
avoid chronic use of corticosteroids, etanercept was started in
May 2003 and the corticosteroids were tapered. This led to
exacerbations of a mild polyarthritis and worsening of the rash
but no fever. Because selective COX-2 inhibitors may be safe in
patients with intolerance to NSAIDs,4 5 rofecoxib was success￾fully added to etanercept without intolerance. However, a
second challenge with rofecoxib resulted in severe angio￾oedema and urticarial rash and the same occurred after
challenges with celecoxib and etoricoxib. IL1 receptor antago￾nist was started in December 2004, leading to a full remission of
all AOSD related symptoms despite the withdrawal of long term
steroid treatment.
DISCUSSION
Our case illustrates that TNFa blocking agents are only
partially effective in the treatment of refractory AOSD. Partial
or limited efficacy of these agents has also been also observed
in patients with systemic onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis.7 8
Our case and several other reports suggest that it is not TNFa

but IL1 which has a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of AOSD3
and systemic onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis.9 In these
diseases and in other rare disorders with a single amino acid
mutation in the NALP-3 gene which results in increased IL1
secretion, IL1 blockade seems to be the preferred treatment.10
Furthermore, our case suggests that hypersensitivity to
NSAIDs is not exclusively mediated by COX-1 blockade, but
can also be provoked by selective COX-2 inhibitors that can
function as haptens, resulting in anaphylaxis upon next
exposure.5 Our case shows that these reactions are not
mediated by TNFa and not altered by TNFa neutralisation.

Distal degeneration of sensory and autonomic cutaneous
nerve fibres in systemic sclerosis

...............................................................................................................................
Ann Rheum Dis 2005;64:1524–1526. doi: 10.1136/ard.2005.038935
We studied innervation and dermal vasculature in
affected and apparently normal skin of sclerodermic
patients to evaluate the involvement of different
nerve fibre groups and to determine a possible correlation
with vascular damage in this disease. Immunohistochemical
analysis and confocal microscopic examination of skin biopsy
samples were used.
METHODS AND RESULTS
We obtained 3 mm punch skin biopsy samples from the
distal thigh and distal leg in 11 consecutive 34–70 year old
female patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc), identified by
the American College of Rheumatology classification criteria.1
We excluded patients who had been exposed to potentially
neurotoxic exogenous or endogenous conditions. The skin
appeared sclerotic in 4/11 patients in the leg and in 3/11 in
the thigh (table 1). In four patients a further skin sample
from fingertip was taken to evaluate myelinated fibres. None
of the patients complained of sensory disturbances, and
neurological and neurophysiological evaluations were normal
except in two patients, in whom a conduction velocity study
showed the presence of an entrapment syndrome. Patient
morphological findings were compared with data from a
group of 16 healthy volunteers (nine male, seven female, age
range 34–65 years).
Skin biopsy specimens were processed according to
previously published procedures.2 Floating sections were
immunostained using a panel of primary antibodies, includ￾ing the pan-neuronal marker anti-protein gene product
(PGP) 9.5, anti-myelin basic protein for myelinated fibres,
anti-vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) to mark autonomic
nerve fibres, and anti-collagen IV to visualise basement
membrane and blood vessels.
We quantified, as previously described, epidermal nerve
fibres (ENFs) per linear millimetre,3 Meissner corpuscles
(MCs), and myelinated papillary endings per square milli￾metre4 on confocal images using image analysis software
(Neurolucida, Microbrightfield Inc, Colchester VT, USA;
ScionImage, Scion Corporation, Frederick, MD, USA). On
the same images used to quantify ENF density, we measured
blood vessel density in mm2
/100 mm2 of dermal tissue within
250 mm below the basement membrane.
We found a significant loss of ENFs in sclerodermic
patients in all the examined sites (table 1) without a distal￾proximal gradient, a poor subepidermal neural plexus, and a
reduced innervation of sweat glands, blood vessels, and
arrector pilorum muscles compared with controls. These
findings, evident in apparently unaffected areas (figs 1E and
F compared with 1A and B), were more severe in clinically
involved skin (figs 1C and D compared with 1A and B) and
affected both sensory and autonomic unmyelinated nerve
fibres as demonstrated by PGP and VIP immunostainings.
The mean (SD) density of blood vessels measured in mm2
/
100 mm2 of dermal tissue, was 6.4 (2.9) and 8.7 (4.7),
respectively, in the thigh and leg of patients with SSc. These
values significantly correlated with the density of epidermal
nerve fibres in both sites (r
2 = 0.51; p,0.05 at the thigh and
r
2 = 0.58; p,0.05 at the leg). In glabrous skin we found a
significant reduction of MC density compared with controls,
with a number of intrapapillary myelinated fibres still within
the normal range. Moreover, evident structural abnormalities
of the surviving mechanoreceptors and predegenerative

aspects of myelinated fibres, such as swellings or vacuolisa￾tion, were present.
DISCUSSION
Our data indicate that the cutaneous nerves in SSc are
impaired. This mainly involves the unmyelinated sensory and
autonomic nerve fibres, but does not completely spare the
large fibres. The observation that the loss of ENFs was more
significant in subjects with an evident reduction of vascular
bed suggests that ischaemia may have a role in determining
the neuropathic process. However, we cannot rule out the
possibility that early biohumoral changes, demonstrated in
apparently unaffected skin,5 6 may induce both neural and
vascular damage. We speculate that the abnormalities of
terminal innervation seen in the skin may be present in
multiple organs in SSc. This neuropathic process, affecting

endothelium and epidermis (ULEX Europaeus in blue). Sweat gland images in a healthy subject (B) and in sclerodermic patients from affected (D) and
apparently normal (F) skin, are double stained to visualise nerve fibres (rPGP in yellow-green) and vessels (mColIV in red). A derangement of dermal
architecture, of subepidermal neural plexus, and a marked reduction of ENF density are evident in affected and, although to a lesser extent, in
apparently normal skin of patients with SSc (C and E compared with A). A loss of nerve fibres innervating dermal annexes such as arrector pilorum
muscles (E compared with A) and sweat glands (D and F compared with B) in skin from sclerodermic patients is also evident. Bar = 50 mm. E,
epidermis; ENFs, epidermal nerve fibres; BM, basement membrane; V, blood vessels; SNP, subepidermal neural plexus; APM, arrector pilorum muscle.
