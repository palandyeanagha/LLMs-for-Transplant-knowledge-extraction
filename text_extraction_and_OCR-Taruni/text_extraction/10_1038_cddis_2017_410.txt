Doxorubicin (DOX) is a highly effective antineoplastic anthracycline drug; however, the adverse effect of the cardiotoxicity has
limited its widespread application. Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), as a well-known regulator of glucose and lipid metabolism,
was recently shown to exert cardioprotective effects. The aim of this study was to investigate the possible protective effects of
FGF21 against DOX-induced cardiomyopathy. We preliminarily established DOX-induced cardiotoxicity models in H9c2 cells, adult
mouse cardiomyocytes, and 129S1/SyImJ mice, which clearly showed cardiac dysfunction and myocardial collagen accumulation
accompanying by inflammatory, oxidative stress, and apoptotic damage. Treatment with FGF21 obviously attenuated the DOX￾induced cardiac dysfunction and pathological changes. Its effective anti-inflammatory activity was revealed by downregulation of
inflammatory factors (tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6) via the IKK/IκBα/nuclear factor-κB pathway. The anti-oxidative
stress activity of FGF21 was achieved via reduced generation of reactive oxygen species through regulation of nuclear
transcription factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 transcription. Its anti-apoptotic activity was shown by reductions in the number of
TUNEL-positive cells and DNA fragments along with a decreased ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 expression. In a further mechanistic study,
FGF21 enhanced sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) binding to liver kinase B1 (LKB1) and then decreased LKB1 acetylation, subsequently inducing
AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation, which improved the cardiac inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. These
alterations were significantly prohibited by SIRT1 RNAi. The present work demonstrates for the first time that FGF21 obviously
prevented DOX-induced cardiotoxicity via the suppression of oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis through the SIRT1/
LKB1/AMPK signaling pathway.

With advances in cancer treatments, the numbers of cancer
survivors increased quickly.1 However, a medical survey of
1807 cancer survivors followed for 7 years showed that 33%
died of heart diseases.2 Despite doxorubicin (DOX) effective￾ness against cancer, dose-dependent cardiotoxicity restricts
its long-term application in chemotherapy, as it diminishes the
quality of life of cancer patients.3,4 For example, one case
report described DOX-related congestive heart failure in a
patient who had received a 400 mg/m2 cumulative dose of
DOX.5 The onset of cardiac complications can occur during
treatment with DOX or up to 10 years after cessation of DOX
therapy.6 In fact, cardiovascular-related disease derived from
the adverse effects of cancer treatments has become the
leading noncancer-related cause of morbidity and mortality in
long-term cancer survivors.6
Despite great achievements gained over the past several
decades, the precise mechanisms implicated in DOX-induced
cardiomyopathy remain unclear. Oxidative stress, inflamma￾tion, and apoptosis have been proposed as the mechanisms
of the DOX-induced cardiotoxicity, which at least could result in
cardiac remodeling and dysfunction.7 To date, no targeted
strategies are available for preventing DOX-induced cardio￾toxicity. Some chemicals and functional factors have been
evaluated for their ability to moderate DOX-induced
cardiotoxicity, but little success was reported.8–10 Currently,
dexrazoxane is the only agent approved by the United States
Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines
Agency for the prevention of long-term cardiotoxicity caused
by DOX. Nevertheless, dexrazoxane may interfere with the
anticancer activity of DOX and lead to a higher latent risk for
acute myeloid leukemia in pediatric patients.11 Thus, a more
specific drug or strategy needs to be developed to protect
against DOX cardiotoxicity.
Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), as an effective
metabolic factor on glucose and lipid metabolism, was
predominantly found in adipose and liver tissue. However,
based on our and other’s studies, FGF21 is expressed in other
tissues such as the myocardium.12–14 Numerous studies have
demonstrated that FGF21 displays anti-inflammatory and anti￾oxidative stress activities,15,16 and thus has a critical role in
protecting against tissue injury from acute toxicity.17,18 In
addition, the anti-apoptotic activity of FGF21 in islet β-cells and
endothelial cells also was reported.19,20 More recently, studies
demonstrated FGF21-mediated protection against cardiac
ischemia and reperfusion injury21 and isoprenaline-induced
myocardial hypertrophy.22 Still, the exact effect of FGF21 and
the detailed underlying mechanism on the cardiac system
remain largely unclear. Our previous research demonstrated

that FGF21 interacts with its receptors to stimulate sirtuin 1
(SIRT1)-dependent autophagy, which prevents diabetic
cardiomyopathy.13,14 Nevertheless, no study was yet explored
the effect of FGF21 on DOX-induced cardiac injury.
In the present study, we first examined the protective ability
of FGF21 against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. Furthermore,
the mechanisms of FGF21’s cardioprotective activity were
analyzed using cardiomyoblasts (H9c2 cells), adult mouse
cardiomyocytes, and a wild-type mouse model (129S1/
SvImJ). The results of these experiments demonstrated that
the cytotoxicity of DOX to H9c2 cells, adult mouse cardio￾myocytes, and the heart of 129S1/SvImJ mice can be
attenuated by FGF21. Further mechanistic studies showed
that FGF21 obviously prevented the DOX-induced cardiotoxi￾city via the suppression of oxidative stress, inflammation, and
apoptosis through activating the SIRT1/liver kinase B1
(LKB1)/AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling path￾way both in vitro and in vivo. Our findings indicate that FGF21
could be considered as a therapeutic target for the clinical
treatment and prevention for DOX-induced cardiac injury.
Results
FGF21 prevented DOX-induced cardiac remodeling and
dysfunction. After administration of FGF21 to the DOX
(5 mg/ml)- or PBS-treated 129S1/SvImJ mice, cardiac fibro￾sis was preliminary analyzed with Sirius red staining.
Compared with the PBS control treatment, DOX treatment
clearly caused collagen accumulation (red staining) in the
cardiac slides (Figure 1a), indicating the induction of cardiac
fibrosis. Pre-treatment with FGF21 significantly reduced the
degree of collagen deposition induced by DOX. This result
was continuously confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR
(qRT-PCR) for collagen I mRNA expression (Figure 1b) and
found that DOX-induced collagen I increase was obviously
blocked by pre-administration of FGF21.
Furthermore, DOX-induced cardiac fibrosis was verified by
increased expression of pro-fibrotic mediators, connective
tissue growth factor (CTGF) and transforming growth factor β
(TGF-β) (Figures 1c and d), and these elevations were almost
completely prevented by FGF21 pre-treatment.
Next, we performed a cardiac functional analysis by
echocardiography in the indicated treatment groups. DOX
treatment significantly increased the left ventricular (LV)
internal systolic diameter, the LV internal diastolic diameter,
the LV end diastolic volume, and the LVend systolic volume, but
decreased the ejection fraction (EF) and fractional shortening
(FS; Table 1). Overall, pretreatment with FGF21 considerably
recovered the alteration induced by DOX (Table 1).
Inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis are reported to
participate in DOX-induced cardiotoxicity;23 therefore, we
subsequently investigated the protective activity of FGF21
against DOX-induced inflammation, oxidative stress, and
apoptosis in the H9c2 cell line and adult mouse
cardiomyocytes.
FGF21 attenuated the upregulation of inflammatory
cytokines and NF-κB p65 activation in DOX-treated
H9c2 cells and adult cardiomyocytes. As shown in
Figures 2a–c and Supplementary Figure 2A, DOX signifi￾cantly increased the mRNA levels of tumor necrosis factor-α
(TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), but not IL-1β compared with
levels in the control, which were remarkably inhibited by
pretreatment with FGF21. NF-κB p65 is regarded as a major
controller of the transcription and expression of several
inflammatory cytokines (such as TNF-α and IL-6),24 and
IKK/IκBα mediates the activation and nuclear translocation of
NF-κB p65. Therefore, we detected the effect of FGF21 on
phosphorylated IKK (p-IKK) and IκBα protein (p-IκBα) expres￾sion by western blotting (Figures 2d and e). Interestingly, DOX
treatment significantly increased both p-IKK and p-IκBα
expression, and these alterations were obviously attenuated
by pretreatment with FGF21. Continuously, the sub-cellular
distribution of NF-κB p65 was analyzed by western blotting to
observe whether the alteration in IKK and IκBα affects NF-κB
p65 nuclear translocation. Clearly, DOX significantly
increased the nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65 from the
cytosol and this effect was abolished by pre-treatment with
FGF21 (Figure 2f and Supplementary Figure 2B).
FGF21 efficiently prevented the DOX-induced generation
of ROS and oxidative stress. To determine whether FGF21
can prevent the DOX-induced generation of reactive oxygen
species (ROS), we measured the ROS levels in different
groups. In a dihydrogen ethidium (DHE) staining study
(Figure 3a), FGF21 significantly prevented the DOX-induced
ROS formation in H9c2 cells. In addition, levels of the
oxidative stress marker proteins 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) and
4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE) (Figures 3c and d, and
Supplementary Figures 3A and B), and malondialdehyde
(Figure 3b and Supplementary Figure 3C) were significantly
increased in the DOX group, and these increases were
obviously reduced by FGF21 in the FGF21/DOX groups in
both H9c2 and adult cardiomyocytes. Nuclear transcription
factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), as an antioxidant
sensor, can translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, to
interact with the antioxidant defense system and mediate
the transcription of target genes. According to western blot
analysis (Figure 3e and Supplementary Figure 3D),
nuclear Nrf2 accumulation and activity via quantification
of its downstream gene such as NADPH quinone
oxidoreductase-1 (NQO-1), catalase (CAT), and heme
oxygenase 1 (HO-1) (Figure 3f and Supplementary
Figure 3E) in the DOX group was significantly less than that
in the controls, and this effect also was prevented by
pre-treatment with FGF21 in both H9c2 cells and adult
cardiomyocytes. Taken together, our results indicate that
FGF21 attenuated DOX-induced oxidative stress, likely
through restoration of a Nrf2-regulated antioxidant capacity.
FGF21 attenuated DOX-induced cardiac apoptosis
through the mitochondrial cell death pathway. The anti￾apoptotic activity of FGF21 was further examined in the DOX￾induced cardiac injury model. Consistent with a previous
study,7 DOX notably induced apoptosis in H9c2 cells and
adult cardiomyocytes as detected by TUNEL staining, DNA
fragmentation, and caspase-3 and (ADP-ribose) polymerase
(PARP) cleavage (Figures 4a–c and Supplementary Figures
4A and B) compared with those levels in control cells.

Noticeably, FGF21 completely attenuated these pro-apoptotic
activities of DOX.
Accumulating evidence indicates that mitochondrial death
pathways have a key role in multiple programmed cell death
processes. FGF21 was reported to be involved in mitochon￾drial cell death pathways in diabetes-induced testicular cell
death.25 Here we analyzed the mechanism of the anti￾apoptotic activity of FGF21 in DOX-treated H9c2 cells and
adult cardiomyocytes. We did not observe any significant
differences in the levels of cleaved caspase-8 among the
groups treated with DOX (Figure 4d). Therefore, we focused
on the mitochondrial cell death pathways in our subsequent
research. Western blot analysis revealed a significant
increase in the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio (Figure 4e and
Supplementary Figure 4C), an index of the mitochondrial
cell death pathway,26 in the DOX group, and this change
was significantly normalized by FGF21 in the FGF21/
DOX group.
Figure 2 FGF21 attenuated the upregulation of inflammatory cytokines and NF-kB p65 activation induced by DOX in H9c2 cells. The mRNA levels of TNF-α (a), IL-6 (b), and
IL-1β (c) were examined by qRT-PCR, the phosphorylated (P-) and total proteins (T-) of the IKK (d) and IκBα (e) were detected by western blot, and the NF-κB p65 protein was
detected in isolated nuclear and cytosol fractions by western blot using histone H3 and GAPDH as loading controls (f) in H9c2 cells treated with the indicated chemicals. Data are

FGF21 prohibited interaction of SIRT1 with LKB1 in DOX￾treated H9c2 cells and adult cardiomyocytes. Our pre￾vious research demonstrated that FGF21 interacts with its
receptors to prevent diabetic cardiomyopathy.14 Thus, the
mRNA expression of both FGFR1c and β-Klotho receptors,
which are reported as two major receptors for FGF21,27 as

well as FGFR2, FGFR3, and FGFR4 were examined by qRT￾PCR in DOX-treated H9c2 cells and adult cardiomyocytes.
The results demonstrated that only FGFR1 and β-Klotho
receptors (Figures 5a and b, and Supplementary Figure 5A),
but not the other receptors, were significantly upregulated in
the FGF21 and FGF21/DOX groups, and slightly decreased
(but without statistical significance) in the DOX group. The
phosphorylation of the signaling molecules downstream of
FGF receptors were analyzed as well following FGF21
stimulation, which demonstrated that FGF21 treatment could
significantly trigger the FRS2 and ERK1/2 activation in the
FGF21 and FGF21/DOX groups (Figure 5c and
Supplementary Figure 5B).
To investigate whether FGF21 upregulates deacetylase
activity in the DOX-induced cardiac injury, we detected
expression of the major nuclear histone deacetylases
(HDACs), including SIRT1, SIRT6, and HDAC1. The results
showed that FGF21 significantly upregulated either SIRT1 or
SIRT6 activities in the FGF21 group. Conversely, DOX
obviously decreased the expression of SIRT1 and SIRT6
compared with levels in the control group and these effects
could be abolished by FGF21 in the FGF21/DOX group. In
addition, HDAC1 expression did not significantly change
among all groups (Figure 5d and Supplementary Figure 5C).
In a signaling transduction investigation, we found that
FGF21 treatment significantly increased phosphorylation of
AMPK in DOX-treated H9c2 cells and adult cardiomyocytes
(Figure 5e and Supplementary Figure 5D). LKB1 has been
verified to be the major upstream kinase of AMPK in a majority
of tissues.28 The deacetylation status of LKB1 directly
influences its intracellular localization and AMPK-regulating
activity.29 To determine whether FGF21 mediates SIRT1/
SIRT6-regulated LKB1 deacetylation, the acetylation level of
LKB1 was analyzed by immunoprecipitation (IP)/western
blotting. The results shown in Figure 5f and Supplementary
Figure 5E indicate that FGF21 significantly decreased DOX￾induced LKB1 acetylation and subsequently increased AMPK
activation in the FGF21/DOX group. To explore which HDAC
(s) interacts with LKB1, the nuclear extracts of the indicated
H9c2 cells and adult cardiomyocytes were subjected to IP
assays with SIRT1 or SIRT6 antibody as probes in LKB1-
precipitated samples. Clearly, the IP tests showed that DOX
prohibited the interaction of SIRT1 with LKB1 (left panel of
Figure 5g and Supplementary Figure 5F), and FGF21 could
notably restore this interaction of SIRT1 and LKB1 in the
FGF21/DOX group. In contrast, no SIRT6-LKB1 interaction
was detected among all groups (right panel of Figure 5g).
Anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, and anti-apoptotic
activities of FGF21 in DOX-stimulated 129S1/SvImJ mice
cardiac samples in vivo. To confirm the above findings
in vivo in 129S1/SvImJ mice, as shown in the left panel of
Figure 6a, we found that administration of FGF21 significantly
attenuated the upregulation of TNF-α and IL-6 mRNA
expression induced by DOX in mice by qRT-PCR. Western
blot analysis revealed that the DOX-upregulated nuclear NF￾κB p65 protein was obviously reduced by FGF21 (right panels
of Figure 6a) as well. These results verified the anti-cardiac
inflammatory activity of FGF21 in vivo.
Continuously, the anti-oxidative stress and anti-apoptotic
activities of FGF21 were detected in vivo using DOX-treated
mice heart samples. In DHE and TUNEL staining analysis,
treatment with FGF21 resulted in clear reductions in numbers
of DHE-stained (Figure 6b) and TUNEL-positive (Figure 6c)
cells induced by DOX. In addition, the DOX-upregulated
cleaved caspase-3 (Figure 6d) was returned to normal levels
after FGF21 administration, according to western blot
analyses.
The signaling pathway for the ability of FGF21 to protect
against DOX-induced cardiac toxicity was examined in vivo as
well. Consistent with our previous results in vitro, the
expression of SIRT1 and the acetylated LKB1 and phos￾phorylated AMPK were almost normalized by FGF21 in DOX￾treated cardiac samples (Figures 6e and f).
SIRT1 gene knockdown restricted the anti-inflammatory,
anti-oxidative, and anti-apoptotic activities of FGF21 in
DOX-stimulated H9c2 cells and adult cardiomyocytes. To
verify the critical role of SIRT1 in the deacetylation of LKB1 by
FGF21, SIRT1 RNAi was employed and efficiently knocked
down SIRT1 expression in both H9c2 cells and adult
cardiomyocytes (Figure 7a and Supplementary Figure 6A).
Interestingly, SIRT1 knockdown by RNAi almost completely
recovered the level of acetylated LKB1 (Figure 7b and
Supplementary Figure 6B) and subsequently prohibited the
AMPK activity induced by FGF21 (Figure 7a and
Supplementary Figure 6A), through which the critical role of
SIRT1 in FGF21-induced activation of LKB1 and AMPK in
DOX-treated H9c2 cells and adult cardiomyocytes was
emphasized.
Based on this finding, the anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative,
and anti-apoptotic activities of FGF21 continued to be
investigated in the SIRT1 gene knockdown H9c2 cells and
adult cardiomyocytes treated with DOX. As expected, knock￾ing down of SIRT1 by RNAi restricted the anti-inflammatory,
anti-oxidative, and anti-apoptotic activities of FGF21. Com￾pared with the siRNA control data, the capacity of FGF21 to
attenuate DOX-induced inflammatory marker protein (NF-κB
p65, in Figure 7c and Supplementary Figure 6C), apoptotic
representative protein (Caspase 3, in Figure 7c and
Supplementary Figure 6C), and ROS (Figure 7d) was
significantly restricted after transfection of H9c2 cells and
adult cardiomyocytes with SIRT1-specific siRNA.
Discussion
This study for the first time revealed that FGF21 can improve
cardiac dysfunction and pathological changes induced by
DOX. The major finding from both in vitro and in vivo
experiments was that FGF21 exerts anti-inflammatory, anti￾oxidative stress, and anti-apoptotic effects to attenuate the
cardiac injury induced by DOX via activation of the SIRT1/
LKB1/AMPK pathway.
The pathogenesis of DOX-induced cardiotoxicity involves
complex processes, of which the underlying mechanisms are
involved in the activation of various downstream
pro-inflammatory, pro-oxidative, and pro-apoptotic
processes.30 The increasing numbers of basic and clinical
studies suggest that pro-inflammatory factors, including

TNF-α and IL-6, participate in the pathogenesis of DOX￾induced heart dysfunction.31 In response to the extracellular
stimulation, IKK is converted from a neutral form to the active
form and subsequently phosphorylates IκBα to result in its
degradation. Upon IκBα degradation, NF-κB is then released
from association with the IκBα to translocate into the nucleus

where it triggers inflammatory cytokine synthesis.32 In our
DOX-induced cardiac injury model, we preliminary found that
DOX clearly elevated TNF-α and IL-6 expression along with
phosphorylation of both IKK and IκBα. Pre-treatment with
FGF21 not only obviously attenuated the DOX-induced
upregulation of TNF-α and IL-6 levels, but also decreased

the levels of phosphorylated IKK and IκBα. FGF21, in addition,
significantly blocked the DOX-induced nuclear translocation of
NF-κB p65 (Figures 2 and 6, and Supplementary Figure 2).
Taken together, these results indicate that FGF21 plays an
anti-inflammatory role in the DOX-induced cardiotoxicity, and
the mechanism may involve activation of IKK by FGF21 to
preserve the IκBα/NF-κB p65 association. The association of
IκBα/NF-κB p65 then limits NF-κB p65 translocation into
nuclei, thereby inhibiting transcription of inflammatory factors
(such as TNF-α and IL-6).
Hearts of cancer patients receiving DOX therapy are highly
sensitive to DOX-induced oxidative stress. The heart
expresses low levels of antioxidant enzymes, rendering it
particularly vulnerable to free radical damage and DOX
cardiotoxicity.33,34 In our model, multiple lines of evidence
showed that DOX induced ROS generation and oxidative
stress in cardiac tissue, and FGF21 exhibited the capacity to
alleviate the degree of oxidative stress induced by DOX. It has
been suggested that the occurrence of oxidative injury reflects
the generation of ROS, which exceeds the capacity of
antioxidant defense systems.35 Then the expression of
antioxidant proteins Nrf2, NQO-1, HO-1, and CAT was found
to be decreased in the DOX group, and these reductions were
all significantly attenuated by FGF21. These data suggest that
FGF21 possesses the free radical scavenging and antioxidant
capacity via activation of Nrf2 (Figures 3 and 6, and
Supplementary Figure 3).
The increase in myocardial cell apoptosis is another
pathogenic mechanism in the DOX-induced cardiotoxicity.36
Some researchers believed that cardiomyocyte apoptosis
could be the leading cause of cardiac dysfunction in DOX￾induced cardiomyopathy.37,38 To estimate the DOX-induced
apoptosis, we conducted a series of assays including TUNEL
staining, DNA fragmentation detection, and examination of the
Bax/Bcl2 ratio in the DOX group. The results indicated that
DOX did induce mitochondrial cell death, whereas FGF21
treatment could abolish these alterations (Figures 4 and 6, and
Supplementary Figure 4).
One of our previous studies showed that FGF21 prevents
lipid- or diabetes-induced cardiac apoptosis by activating the
AMPK pathway13 and another study demonstrated that
activating the LKB1/AMPK pathway prevents the development
of cardiomyopathy in type 2 diabetic mice by improving lipid
metabolism.39 These studies suggest that the LKB1/AMPK
axis is an attractive therapeutic target, since it participates in
multiple biological processes during cellular growth.40 Recent
studies suggest that the LKB1/AMPK axis is a highly sensitive
target of DOX-induced damage in the heart.41,42 Notably, 2 μM
DOX (the peak plasma concentration dose of DOX) decreased
LKB1/AMPK protein expression.43 The detailed mechanisms
of LKB1/AMPK inhibition are still unclear; however, the
mechanism may involve alteration of acetylation activity.
Reportedly, LKB1/AMPK signaling can be controlled
through acetylation and de-acetylation by various acetyltrans￾ferases and HDACs, respectively.44 Among the several
HDACs, SIRT1 is reported to have a critical role in controlling
the cardiac LKB1/AMPK pathway. A study with in vitro and
in vivo models has demonstrated the crucial role of SIRT1 for
the control of inflammation and apoptosis through LKB1/
AMPK-dependent pathways.45 In cultured 293 T cells, regula￾tion of the LKB1/AMPK pathway by SIRT1 was also
reported.29 In the present study, we found that FGF21
promotes interaction of LKB1 with SIRT1, then diminishes
lysine acetylation of LKB1 and concurrently increases its
activity, and subsequently activates AMPK to prevent the
DOX-induced inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis in
cardiac cells (Figures 5 and 6, and Supplementary Figure 5).
It is noteworthy that SIRT1 seems to have a critical role in
this pathway. To verify this hypothesis, we employed an SIRT1
RNAi to specifically block this pathway to see whether the
FGF21 still prevented DOX-induced cardiac cellular inflam￾mation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. Undoubtedly, the
SIRT1 RNAi not only prohibited the FGF21-induced LKB1 and
AMPK activity, but also abolished the anti-inflammatory, anti￾oxidative stress, and anti-apoptotic activities of FGF21
(Figure 7 and Supplementary Figure 6). These results verified
our supposition that SIRT1 is a critical factor in FGF21-
induced cardiac protection.
In conclusion, this study demonstrated that FGF21 can
protect against DOX-induced cardiac toxicity. The molecular
mechanism responsible for FGF21’s cardioprotective activity
may involve activation of the SIRT1/LKB1/AMPK signaling
pathway, which alleviates DOX-induced inflammation, oxida￾tive stress, and apoptosis to improve cardiac dysfunction. This
finding may provide an effective way to protect against or
reduce the cardiac adverse effects of anthracycline during
anti-cancer therapy. In addition, it delivers theoretic evidence
to support the development of some more efficient and safer
FGF21-like medicines such as LY2405319.46
Materials and Methods
Cell culture, animal care, and experimental design. The rat
cardiomyoblast line H9c2 was purchased from the American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA). For the in vitro study design, the H9c2 cells
were pretreated with FGF21 at 50 ng/ml for 2 h and then incubated with DOX at
5 μg/ml for 22 h. All the experimental procedures involving animals were approved
by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Jilin University, which
was in accordance with Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, Eighth
Edition (Library of Congress Control Number: 2010940400, revised 2011). Eight￾week-old male 129S1/SvImJ mice were divided into four groups (Control, FGF21-,
DOX-, and FGF21/DOX-treated mice) with 11 mice in each group. In the FGF21/
DOX-group, the mice were given an intraperitoneal injection of 100 μg/kg body
weight FGF21 5 days/week for 5 weeks. This regimen included 1 week of FGF21
pretreatment before DOX exposure. One week later, the mice were intraperitoneally
injected with DOX (5 mg/kg) once a week for the remaining 4 weeks. PBS injection

mRNA levels were analyzed by qRT-PCR in heart samples from different groups of 129S1/SvImJ mice (left panel of a). The NF-κB p65 protein was detected in isolated nuclear
fraction by western blotting, and histone H3 served as the loading control (right panel of a). ROS in the heart slides from different groups of 129S1/SvImJ mice were stained by
DHE (Red), and images were taken under a fluorescence microscope (scale bars, 50 μm) (b). Apoptotic cells in heart slides from the indicated groups were stained with TUNEL
(scale bars= 50 μm) (c). Western blot results showed expression of cleaved caspase 3 (d), SIRT1 (e), phosphorylated AMPK (P-AMPK, in e), and acetylated LKB1 (detected by
IP/Western blot, in F) in the heart samples from different groups. Data are presented as means± S.D. (n=11). *Po0.05 versus Ctrl group; #

served as a control treatment, and injection of FGF21 or DOX alone was applied in
the FGF21 and DOX groups, respectively.
Primary cardiomyocyte isolation and treatment. Adult mouse
cardiomyocytes were isolated and cultured as our previous description.13 The
adult cardiomyocytes were pretreated with FGF21 at 50 ng/ml for 2 h and then
incubated with DOX at 5 μg/ml for 22 h. A preliminary study was performed to
optimize the transfection efficiency with SIRT1 siRNA in adult mouse
cardiomyocytes (Supplementary Figure 1).
Sirius red staining. Collagen accumulation was analyzed with Sirius red
staining. The sections were incubated with 0.1% Sirius-red F3BA and 0.25% Fast
Green FCF and observed under a Nikon microscope. A computer-assisted image￾analysis system was applied to evaluate the sections stained for Sirius red as
described before.14 Semi-quantitative analysis was obtained by computerization of
the percentage of the positive staining from six samples in each group with two
sections for each sample and five images for each section.
Echocardiography. To assess cardiac function, transthoracic echocardiography
was performed using a Philips 7500 with a 15-MHz transducer (Sonos 7500,
Amsterdam, The Netherlands) as described before.47 Transthoracic echocardiography
at the parasternal long-axis and short-axis views were performed and recorded. Two￾dimensional and M-mode echo were employed to detect the wall motion, the chamber
dimensions, and the cardiac function. LV dimensions and wall thicknesses were
estimated with parasternal short axis M-mode images. Simultaneously, EF, FS, LV
mass, and LV end diastolic volume were calculated by Philips7500 software. The final
data represented averaged values of 10 cardiac cycles.
Quantitative real-time PCR. The mRNA levels of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β,
collagen-1, FGFR1, β-Klotho, FGFR2, FGFR3, and FGFR4 were quantified by qRT￾PCR as described previously.47,48 The primers of TNF-α (Mm00443285_m1), IL-6
(Mm00446190_m1), IL-1β (Mm00434228_m1), collagen-1 (Mm01302043), FGFR1
(Mm00438930_m1), β-Klotho (Mm00473122_m1), FGFR2 (Mm01269930_m1),
FGFR3 (Mm00433294_m1), FGFR4 (Mm01341852_m1), and β-actin
(Mm00607939) were from Applied Biosystems (Carlsbad, CA, USA). The
expression levels of the target genes were normalized to that of the housekeeping
gene β-actin.
Western blotting. To analyze the protein expression, western blot analysis was
performed as previously described.47,49 The primary antibodies to Nrf2, HDAC1,
SIRT1, SIRT6, and AMPK were purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, MA, USA).
Anti-LKB1 was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Sigma, MO, USA), anti-HO-1, anti￾NQO-1, anti-CAT, anti-IKK, anti-IκBα, anti-β-Klotho, anti-CTGF, and anti-TGF-β
were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Anti-p65, anti￾caspase-8, anti-caspase-3, anti-PARP, anti-Bax, anti-Bcl-2, anti-FGFR1, and anti￾acetylated-lysine were purchased from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA, USA). Anti-3-
NT was from Millipore (Billerica, CA, USA), and anti-4-HNE was from Alpha
Diagnostic International (San Antonio, TX, USA). After three washes with Tris￾buffered saline (pH 7.2) containing 0.05% Tween 20, the membrane was reacted
with appropriate secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, the
probed proteins were stained with enhanced chemiluminescence reagent and
visualized using the BIO-RAD ChemiDoc Touch Imaging System (BIO-RAD,
Hercules, CA, USA).
Preparation of nuclear extract proteins. Nuclear protein was extracted
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Frederick,
MD, USA). The heart tissue, H9c2 cells, or adult cardiomyocytes after different
treatments were harvested, centrifuged, and incubated in ice-cold buffer for 10 min.
The supernatant (cytoplasmic extract) was immediately transferred to a clean pre￾chilled tube and stored at −80 °C. The insoluble (pellet) fraction was resuspended
and vortexed for 15 s every 10 min for a total 40 min, and after centrifugation, the
nuclear protein was obtained and stored at −80 °C. For western blot analysis,
histone H3, and GAPDH were used as internal controls for nuclear and cytoplasmic
extracts, respectively.
DHE staining. The DHE staining method was applied to measure the
generation of ROS. The pre-treated H9c2 cells (1 × 106 cells/well) or heart tissue
sections (5 μm thick) were incubated with 5 μM/ml DHE dye (Invitrogen, Grand
Island, NY, USA) in Hank’s balanced salt solution buffer for 30 min at 37 °C without
light. Oxidative stress was examined and captured by immunofluorescence
microscopy. The DHE fluorescence intensity (red staining) was quantified using
Image Pro Plus software (Media Cybernetics Inc., Bethesda, MD, USA).
TUNEL staining. Five-micrometer-thick tissue sections were used for TUNEL
staining with ApopTag Peroxidase In Situ Apoptosis Detection Kit (Chemicon,
Temecula, CA, USA).13 Briefly, the slides were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and
treated with proteinase K (20 mg/ml) for 15 min at room temperature. The slide was
preliminarily incubated with a TUNEL reaction mixture containing terminal
deoxynucleotidyl transferase and digoxigenin-11-dUTP at room temperature for
2 h. Then hematoxylin was used for counterstaining.
The H9c2 cells (1 × 106 cells/well) were seeded on six-well chamber slides. After
different treatments, the slides were detected with the In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit,
TMR red (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). Hoechst 33342 was used for nuclear
counterstaining. TUNEL-positive cells were imaged under a fluorescence microscope
(Nikon, Tokyo, Japan), and the cell death detection ELISA kit (Roche) was used to
measure histone-bound DNA fragments as described before according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.13
IP assay. The IP assays were performed as described previously.39,49 Briefly,
H9c2 cells, adult cardiomyocytes, or heart tissue were lysed in IP buffer (25 mM
Tris, pH 7.6; 150 mM NaCl; 1 mM EDTA; 1% NP-40; protease and phosphatase
inhibitors). Then 300 μg of the lysate was immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C with
the monoclonal antibodies LKB1 (Sigma-Aldrich) and protein G-agarose (Pierce
Biotechnology Ltd., Rockford, IL, USA). The immunocomplexes were probed by
western blotting with monoclonal anti-LKB1 (Sigma-Aldrich), SIRT1 (Abcam), SIRT6
(Abcam), or acetyl-lysine antibody (Cell Signaling).
Statistical analysis. Data are presented as means±S.D. Two-way analysis of
variance for comparisons was performed for the different groups, followed by
post-hoc pairwise repetitive comparisons with Tukey’s test, using Origin 9.0 Lab data
analysis and graphing software (OriginLab Co., Northampton, MA, USA). Po0.05
was considered statistically significant.
