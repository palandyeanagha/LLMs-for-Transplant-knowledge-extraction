Abstract
With mounting data on its accuracy and prognostic value, cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is becoming
an increasingly important diagnostic tool with growing utility in clinical routine. Given its versatility and wide range
of quantitative parameters, however, agreement on specific standards for the interpretation and post-processing of
CMR studies is required to ensure consistent quality and reproducibility of CMR reports. This document addresses
this need by providing consensus recommendations developed by the Task Force for Post Processing of the
Society for Cardiovascular MR (SCMR). The aim of the task force is to recommend requirements and standards for
image interpretation and post processing enabling qualitative and quantitative evaluation of CMR images.
Furthermore, pitfalls of CMR image analysis are discussed where appropriate.

Preamble
With mounting data on its accuracy and prognostic value,
cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is becoming an
increasingly important diagnostic tool with growing utility
in clinical routine. Given its versatility and wide range of
quantitative parameters, however, agreement on specific
standards for the image interpretation and post processing
of CMR studies is required to ensure consistent quality
and reproducibility of CMR reports. This document ad￾dresses this need by providing consensus recommenda￾tions developed by the Task Force for Post Processing of
the Society for Cardiovascular MR (SCMR). The aim of
the task force is to recommend requirements and stan￾dards for image interpretation and post processing enab￾ling qualitative and quantitative evaluation of CMR
images. Furthermore, pitfalls of CMR image analysis are
discussed where appropriate.
The Task Force is aware that for many of the recommen￾dations, the body of evidence is limited. Thus, this docu￾ment represents expert consensus providing guidance based
on the best available evidence at present as endorsed by the
SCMR. As CMR undergoes rapid development, updated
recommendations for image acquisition, interpretation and
post processing are needed regularly and will be provided by
online appendices when needed and updated Task Force pa￾pers in due course.
The recommendations are considered for the appli￾cation of CMR in clinical routine. For some applica￾tions, quantification is considered as providing added
information but is not mandatory (e.g perfusion

imaging), whereas for others quantification is
required for all clinical reports (e.g. T2* assessment
in iron overload). In general the intention of this
task force is to describe, in which scenarios quantita￾tive analysis should be performed and how it is
performed.
The recommendations respect societal recommenda￾tions for structured reporting of cardiovascular
imaging studies in general (ACCF / ACR / AHA /
ASE / ASNC / HRS / NASCI / RSNA / SAIP / SCAI
/ SCCT / SCMR) [1] and in specific for CMR studies
(SCMR) [2]. These recommendations will be reviewed
and updated regularly and updates made available on
the SCMR website.
The recommendations do not supersede clinical judg￾ment regarding the contents of individual interpretation
of imaging studies.
The Task Force made every effort to avoid conflicts of
interests and, where present, to disclose potential
conflicts.
General recommendations
The recommendations listed in this section apply to the
acquisition and post processing of all CMR data. CMR
studies should be performed for recommended indica￾tions [3], respecting published appropriateness criteria
[4] and the recently published societal CMR expert con￾sensus document [5]. Any analysis should be performed
using uncompressed or lossless compressed DICOM
(Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine)
source images. Readers should have adequate training
and clinical experience. The identity and responsibility
of the reader should be appropriately documented in the
report. Data acquisition should conform to the recom￾mendations of SCMR [6].
Furthermore, the reader of clinical data is also respon￾sible for the use of adequate post processing hardware
and software. The general requirements include
– Workstation and screen of adequate specification
and resolution (as per the specifications of the post￾processing software)
– Post processing software with regulatory approval
for use in patients, ideally providing the following
tools:
– Ability to view all short-axis cines in a single
display
– Ability to perform endocardial and epicardial
contour tracings on short-axis cines
– Ability to correct for atrioventricular annular
location from the long-axis slice onto the most
basal left ventricular (LV) short-axis location in
contour tracings
– Cross references for confirmation of slice position
– Ability to compare cine, late gadolinium
enhancement (LGE) and/or perfusion images
from the same location simultaneously
– Ability to compare short- and long-axis images of
the same region simultaneously
– Ability to compare images of the approximate
same location on the current and prior study
simultaneously for longitudinal studies
– Ability to perform (semi-) quantitative signal
intensity (SI) analysis
– Ability to perform standardized segmentation of
the myocardium according to the model of the
American Heart Association (AHA) [7]
– Ability to use baseline-correction or
comparison to a phantom for flow
measurements can be helpful
– Ability to manually correct heart rate, weight,
body surface area
– Regarding evaluation of angiography the software
should provide the following tools:
– Subtraction of post-contrast from pre-contrast
3D datasets
– 3D multiplanar and maximum intensity
projection (MIP) capabilities
– Volume rendering and surface shaded
reconstructions optional for reporting but not
mandatory for quantitative analysis
– Quantitative diameter analysis based on non￾subtracted 3D-MR angiography (MRA)
– MIP reconstruction based on non-subtracted or
subtracted 3D-MRA datasets
Left ventricular chamber assessment
1. Visual analysis
a) Before analyzing the details, review all cines in cine
mode, validate observations from one plane with the
others, and check for artifacts.
b) Dynamic evaluation of global LV function:
Interpretation of both ventricular chambers, in
concert with extracardiac structures including
assessment for hemodynamic interaction between
the two chambers (e.g., shunts, evidence of
constrictive physiology).
c) Assessment of LV function from a global and
segmental perspective. Segmental wall motion is
based on segmental wall thickening during
systole. Wall motion is categorized as:
hyperkinetic, normokinetic, hypokinetic, akinetic,
dyskinetic.
d) In presence of segmental wall motion abnormalities,
use of standard LV segmentation nomenclature
corresponding to the supplying coronary artery
territories is recommended [2,7].

2. Quantitative analysis
a) General recommendations
i. Calculated parameters: LV end-diastolic volume,
LV end-systolic volume, LV ejection fraction, LV
stroke volume, cardiac output, LV mass, and
body-surface area indexed values of all except
ejection fraction. The parameters quantified may
vary depending on the clinical need.
ii. Evaluation of the stack of short axis images with
computer-aided analysis packages.
iii. Contours of endocardial and epicardial borders at
end-diastole and end-systole (Figure 1).
iv. Epicardial borders should be drawn on the
middle of the chemical shift artifact line (when
present).
v. The LV end-diastolic image should be chosen as
the image with the largest LV blood volume. For
its identification, the full image stack has to be
evaluated and one phase has to be identified as
end-diastole for all the short axis locations.
vi. The LV end-systolic image should be chosen as
the image with the smallest LV blood volume. For
its identification, the full image stack has to be
evaluated and one phase has to be identified as
end-systole for all the short axis locations.
vii. Deviations may occur and extra care should be
taken in the setting of LV dyssynchrony or severe
mitral regurgitation. Aortic valve closure defines
end-systole.
viii. Automatic contour delineation algorithms must
be checked for appropriateness by the reader.
b) LV volumes
i) Papillary muscles are myocardial tissue and thus
ideally should be included with the myocardium.
Because not all evaluation tools allow for their
inclusion without manual drawing of contours,
they are however often included in the volume in
clinical practice, which is acceptable. Reference
ranges that use the same approach should be
used and the inclusion or exclusion of papillary
muscles should be mentioned in the report
(Figure 1) [8-10].
ii) Outflow tract: The LV outflow tract is included
as part of the LV blood volume. When aortic
valve cusps are identified on the basal slice(s) the
contour is drawn to include the outflow tract to
the level of the aortic valve cusps.
Figure 1 Left ventricular (LV) chamber quantification. For LV chamber quantification, the endocardial (blue) and epicardial (yellow) contours
are delineated in diastole (top) and systole (bottom) in a stack of short axis slices that cover the whole left ventricle. a) and b) Illustrates the
approach with inclusion of the papillary muscles as part of the LV volume. c) and d) Shows the approach with exclusion of the papillary muscles
from the LV volume.
Schulz-Menger et al. Journal of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance 2013, 15:35 Page 3 of 19
http://jcmr-online.com/content/15/1/35

iii)Basal descent: As a result of systolic motion of
the mitral valve toward the apex (basal descent)
care must be taken with the one or two most
basal slices. A slice that contains blood volume at
end-diastole may include only left atrium (LA)
without LV blood volume at end-systole. The LA
can be identified when less than 50% of the blood
volume is surrounded by myocardium and the
blood volume cavity is seen to be expanding
during systole. Some software packages
automatically adjust for systolic atrioventricular
ring descent using cross-referencing from long￾axis locations.
c) LV mass
i) Calculation: difference between the total
epicardial volume (sum of epicardial cross￾sectional areas multiplied by the sum of the slice
thickness and interslice gap) minus the total
endocardial volume (sum of endocardial cross￾sectional areas multiplied by the sum of the slice
thickness and interslice gap), which is then
multiplied by the specific density of myocardium
(1.05 g/ml).
ii) Papillary muscles: Papillary muscles are myocardial
tissue and thus ideally should be included with the
myocardium, and this is particularly relevant in
diseases with LV hypertrophy. However, readers may
decide to exclude trabecular tissue and papillary
muscles from the myocardial mass. Reference ranges
that use the same approach should be used and the
inclusion / exclusion of papillary should be
specifically mentioned in the report (Figure 1) [8-10].
iii)Basal descent and apex: When the most basal
slice contains only a small crescent of basal
lateral myocardium and no discernable
ventricular blood pool, an epicardial contour for
the visible myocardium is included for LV mass
only. Similarly, when the most apical slice
contains only a circle of myocardium without
cavitary blood pool, an epicardial contour without
an endocardial contour should be drawn for LV
mass calculations.
d) Rapid quantitative analysis
i) A rapid quantitative analysis can also be
performed using rotational long axis views (e.g. 2-
and 4-chamber views). In cases without expected
significant regional variation of wall motion, this
technique allows for faster evaluation and is not
limited by problems related to basal descent.
When the area-length method is used, with either
a single long-axis view or a bi-plane approach,
specific mention of the analysis technique should
be made in the report.
ii) Calculation [11-13]:
– Single long-axis equation: LV volume = 0.85 ×
(LV-area)2
/ LV-length. This is typically
performed using a 4-chamber view with
calculations of LV volume obtained on both
end-diastolic and end-systolic phases. LV-area
is the planimetered area of the LV cavity from
an endocardial contour with the base drawn as
a straight line through the medial and lateral
aspects of the mitral annulus. LV-length is the
linear dimension from the midpoint of the
mitral annular line to the apical tip of the
endocardial contour.
– Bi-plane equation: LV volume = 0.85 × (LV￾area1 x LV-area2)/ LV-length. Here, both 4-
chamber (LV-area1) and 2-chamber [or vertical]
(LV-area2) long axis views are used to calculate
both end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes,
similar to the single long-axis equation.
e) Cavity diameter and LV wall thickness can be
obtained similar to echocardiography using two
CMR approaches [12,14]:
i) Basal short axis slice: immediately basal to the
tips of the papillary muscles;
ii) 3-chamber view: in the LV minor axis plane at
the mitral chordae level basal to the tips of the
papillary muscles.
iii)Both approaches have good reproducibility. The
3-chamber view is most comparable to data
obtained with echocardiography.
f ) Research:
i) Quantitative evaluation of LV dynamics (e.g.
strain, rotation, time-to-peak velocity) is feasible
by several imaging techniques (e.g. tagging,
DENSE, tissue phase mapping, cine) and requires
specific post-processing software. As research
applications are evolving and consensus evidence
is being accumulated, the Task Force chooses to
refrain from making a dedicated statement at this
time.
Right ventricular chamber assessment
1. Visual analysis
a) Before analyzing the details, review all cines in cine
mode, validate observations from one plane with the
others, and check for artifacts and reliability
b) Assessment of global and regional right ventricular
(RV) function (septal wall, free wall), where
appropriate. Categorization should be noted as:
hyperkinetic, normokinetic, hypokinetic, akinetic,
dyskinetic.
c) Assessment of both ventricular chambers for
hemodynamic interaction (i.e. constrictive
physiology)
Schulz-Menger et al. Journal of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance 2013, 15:35 Page 4 of 19

2. Quantitative analysis
a) General recommendations
i) Calculated parameters: RV end-diastolic volume,
RV end-systolic volume, RV ejection fraction, RV
stroke volume, cardiac output, and body-surface
area indexed values of all except ejection fraction.
Similar to the LV, the parameters quantified may
vary depending on the clinical need [15].
ii) The contiguous stack of short axis images or
transaxial cine images is evaluated with
computer-aided analysis packages (Figure 2)
[16,17].
iii)Transaxial stack of cines covering the RV enable
best identification of the tricuspid valve plane.
iv) Endocardial borders are contoured at end￾diastole and end-systole (Figure 2).
v) The RV end-diastolic image should be chosen as
the image with the largest RV blood volume. For
its identification, the full image stack has to be
evaluated and one phase has to be identified as
end-diastole for all short / transaxial locations.
vi) RV end-systolic image should be chosen as the
image with the smallest RV blood volume. For its
identification, the full image stack has to be
evaluated and one phase has to be identified as
end-systole for all short / transaxial locations.
vii) As for the LV, it may be necessary to review all
image slices in the stack to define end-systole.
viii)The pulmonary valve may be visualized, and
contours are included just up to, but not superior
to this level.
ix) Trabeculations of the RV are ignored and a
smooth endocardial border is drawn to improve
reader reproducibility.
b) RV volumes
i) Total volumes are taken as the sum of volumes
from individual 2D slices, accounting for any
interslice gap and slice thickness. RV trabeculae
and papillary muscles are typically included in RV
volumes.
c) RV mass
i) Usually not quantified in routine assessment.
d) Confirmation of results
Figure 2 Right ventricular (RV) chamber quantification. For RV volume quantification, the endocardial (red) contours are delineated in
diastole (top) and systole (bottom) in a stack of transaxial (a and b) or short-axis (c and d) slices that cover the whole RV.
Schulz-Menger et al. Journal of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance 2013, 15:35 Page 5 of 19

i) If no intra- or extracardiac shunts are present,
the RV and LV stroke volumes should be nearly
equal (small differences are seen as a result of
bronchial artery supply). Since the LV stroke
volume is more reliably determined than the RV
stroke volume, the LV data can be used to
validate RV data.
Post processing of myocardial perfusion imaging
1. Visual analysis
a) For most clinical indications, visual analysis of
myocardial perfusion CMR images is appropriate
b) Work-flow:
i) Display rest and stress perfusion images side-by
-side. If possible also display corresponding LGE
images.
ii) Adjust window and level: The aim of image
adjustment is to set a maximal window width
without “overspilling” of the LV cavity signal into
the myocardium. Ensure that myocardium before
contrast arrival is nearly black and that signal in
the RV and LV cavities is bright grey rather than
a pure white. Correct level and window settings
may require review of both pre- and peak
contrast images.
iii)Apply the same contrast, brightness and window
settings to all images of the dynamic series.
iv) Review series as cines and/or by scrolling through
individual images. Some software packages allow
the display of only dynamic images during the
first myocardial passage.
v) The key diagnostic feature is contrast arrival and
first passage through the LV myocardium.
vi) Visual analysis allows a comparison between
regions to identify relative hypoperfusion.
Comparison can be made between endocardial
and epicardial regions, between segments of the
same slice or between slices.
c) Compare rest and stress images to identify
inducible perfusion defects and artifacts. Note that
unlike nuclear perfusion methods, in CMR the
finding of a “fixed perfusion defect” on rest and
stress perfusion images is not the preferred method
to identify myocardial scar. Instead, scar should be
identified from LGE images.
d) Criteria for an inducible perfusion defect (Figure 3a):
i) Occurs first when contrast arrives in LV
myocardium
ii) Persists beyond peak myocardial enhancement
and for several RR intervals (usually >4)
iii) Is more than one pixel wide
iv) Is usually most prominent in the subendocardial
portion of the myocardium
v) Often manifests as a transmural gradient across
the wall thickness of the segment involved:
densest in the endocardium and gradually
becoming less dense towards the epicardium
vi) Over time, defect regresses towards the
subendocardium
vii) Is present at stress but not at rest
viii)Conforms to the distribution territory of one or
more coronary arteries.
e) Interpret location and extent of inducible perfusion
defect(s) using AHA segment model [2,7].
i) Estimate number of segments involved
ii) Comment on transmurality of perfusion defect
iii) Indicate extent of perfusion defect relative to scar
on LGE
f ) Pitfalls of visual analysis
i) Dark banding artifacts (Figure 3b): A common
source of false-positive reports are subendocardial
dark banding artifacts [18]. These artifacts
– typically occur first and are most prominent
when contrast arrives in the LV blood pool, i.e.
before contrast arrival in the LV myocardium,
depending on applied sequence
– lead to a reduction in signal compared with
baseline myocardial signal (whereas a true
perfusion defect will always show an increase
in signal compared with the baseline even if
this increase is small). These subtle differences
can be hard to appreciate visually. It can
therefore be helpful to draw a region of
interest (ROI) around the suspected artifact
and display its signal-intensity-time profile.
– persist only transiently before the peak
myocardial contrast enhancement, often for
less than approximately 6 RR intervals
– appear predominantly in the phase-encoding
direction
– are approximately one pixel wide
Dark banding present at stress and at rest with
no corresponding scar on LGE images is also
indicative of an artifact [19]. Note however that
differences in heart rate and baseline contrast can
change the appearance and presence of dark
banding between stress and rest perfusion images.
Absence of dark banding at rest with typical dark
banding at stress should therefore not on its own
be considered diagnostic for an inducible
perfusion defect.
ii) Multi-vessel disease: as visual analysis is a relative
assessment of perfusion within an imaged section
of the heart, the presence of balanced multi￾vessel disease can result in most or all of the
imaged section appearing hypoperfused. This can
lead to false-negative readings and needs to be
Schulz-Menger et al. Journal of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance 2013, 15:35 Page 6 of 19
http://jcmr-online.com/content/15/1/35

considered in relevant clinical circumstances. On
visual analysis, a clear endocardial to epicardial
signal gradient may be seen in multi-vessel
disease [20]. Quantitative analysis of the dynamic
perfusion data may be of further help to detect
globally reduced myocardial perfusion reserve in
multi-vessel disease.
iii)Microvascular disease: Diseases that affect the
myocardial microvasculature (e.g. diabetes
mellitus, systemic hypertension) may lead to
concentric reduction in perfusion [21-24]. This
can lead to apparent false-positive readings
relative to angiographic methods and needs to be
considered in relevant clinical circumstances.
Features suggesting microvascular disease are the
presence of concentric LV hypertrophy and a
concentric, often subendocardial perfusion defect
crossing coronary territories. Differentiation from
multi-vessel disease can be challenging.
iv)When performing a stress first-rest second
perfusion protocol, caution is needed when a
defect over a region of infarction may be
misinterpreted as reversible. Contrasting the
extent and location of reversibility by perfusion
imaging with LGE is important to avoid over￾calling of segmental ischemia [25].
v) If vasodilator stress during data acquisition was
inadequate, visual analysis may lead to false￾negative interpretation [26]. Quantitative analysis
of the dynamic perfusion data may be of further
help to detect globally reduced myocardial
perfusion reserve in case of inadequate
vasodilator stress.
vi) Signal intensity may vary depending on the
distance of myocardium from the surface coil and
may lead to misinterpretation if not considered in
the analysis. These problems are less likely if
acquisition is corrected for coil sensitivity.
2. Research tools / Quantitative analysis
a) Objective description of SI change in myocardial
perfusion CMR studies can be performed. Several
methods have been described for this purpose. In
clinical practice, these are rarely required, but they
may supplement visual analysis for example in
suspected multi-vessel disease or suspected
inadequate response to vasodilator stress.
Quantitative analysis is also frequently used in
research studies.
b) Requirements:
i) Validation and definition of a normal range with
the specific pulse sequence and contrast regime
used for data acquisition. If only a comparison
between regions of the same study is made,
establishing a normal range is less relevant.
ii) Consideration of contrast dosage at time of
acquisition (high doses are more likely to lead to
saturation effects in particular of the arterial
input function).
c) Semi-quantitative analysis:
i) Analysis methods that describe characteristics of
the SI profile of myocardial perfusion CMR
studies without estimating myocardial blood flow
are typically referred to as “semi-quantitative
analysis methods”.
ii) Work-flow:
– Select an image from the dynamic series with
good contrast between all cardiac
compartments (some post-processing tools
generate an average image of the series).
– Outline LV endocardial and epicardial
contours on this image (manual or automated)
(Figure 3c).
– Propagate contours to all other dynamic
images.
– Avoid myocardial fat in the ROI
Figure 3 Perfusion imaging. a) Perfusion defect in the inferior segments (yellow arrow). Note defect is predominantly subendocardial, has a
physiologically credible distribution (right coronary artery territory) and is more than one pixel wide. b) Dark banding artifact (yellow arrow). Note
defect is very dark, occurs already before contrast reaches the myocardium, is seen in the phase encoding direction (right-left in this case), and is
approximately one pixel wide. c) Positioning of endocardial (red) and epicardial (green) contours and a ROI in the LV blood pool (blue) for semi￾quantitative or quantitative analysis of perfusion data.
Schulz-Menger et al. Journal of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance 2013, 15:35 Page 7 of 19
http://jcmr-online.com/content/15/1/35

– Correct contour position for through-plane
motion (some analysis packages register
images prior to contours being outlined).
– Depending on the type of analysis to be
performed, place a separate ROI in the LV
blood pool. Preferably the basal slice is used.
Exclude papillary muscles from the ROI.
– Select a reference point in the LV myocardium
for segmentation
(usually the RV insertion point).
– Segment LV myocardium according to AHA
classification [7].
– Generate SI / time profiles for myocardial
segments +/- LV blood pool.
– Consider generating division into endocardial
and epicardial layers and repeat analysis.
iii) Frequently used semi-quantitative analysis methods
(see [27] for detailed review):
– Maximal upslope of the myocardial SI profile,
may be normalized to LV upslope [28]
– Time to peak SI of the myocardial SI profile [29]
– Ratio of stress/rest ratios for the above (often
referred to as “myocardial perfusion reserve
index”) [30]
– The upslope integral (area under the signal
intensity-time curve) [31].
iv) Limitations of semi-quantitative analysis methods:
– SI may vary according to distance from coil
– No absolute measurement of myocardial blood
flow derived
d) Quantitative analysis
i) Analysis methods that process the SI profile of
myocardial perfusion CMR studies to derive
estimates of myocardial blood flow are typically
referred to as “quantitative analysis methods”. See
[27] for review.
ii) Requirements:
– It is a prerequisite for reliable quantification
that data acquisition used an appropriate pulse
sequence and contrast regime.
– An “input function” for analysis of the myocardial
tissue response can be derived from the ROI in
the LV blood pool. In order to reduce saturation
effects in the blood pool, a “dual-bolus”
myocardial perfusion regime may be used, in
which the input function is derived from a
pre-bolus with a small contrast agent
concentration.
– The contrast dose and delivery need to be
chosen to minimize saturation effects also the
myocardium and typically contrast doses
required for reliable quantitative analysis are
lower than those optimized for visual analysis
in clinical routine.
– A temporal resolution of 1-2 RR intervals is
required.
iii)Work-flow:
– Typically, the same source data as for semi￾quantitative analysis are used
– Further post-processing may then take place
on the same or a separate off-line workstation.
iv) Several analysis methods have been described,
including:
– Model-based methods [32]
– Model-independent methods [33]
Post processing of late gadolinium enhancement
studies
1. Visual assessment
a) For most clinical indications, visual assessment of
LGE images is sufficient
b) Work-flow:
i) Modify image window and level so that:
– Noise is still detectable (nulled myocardium
should not be a single image intensity)
– LGE regions are not clipped (LGE regions
should not be a single image intensity)
ii) Note if normal myocardium has a faint
“etched” appearance (darkest at the border
with slightly higher image intensity centrally),
this signifies an inversion time that was set too
short and will lead to underestimation of the
true extent of LGE (Figure 4). In general, an
inversion time that is slightly too long is
preferred to one that is slightly too short [34].
c) Criteria for presence of LGE
i) High SI area that may be as bright as the LV
blood pool
ii) Rule out artifacts (see below)
d) Assess pattern of LGE
i) Coronary artery disease (CAD) type: Should
involve the subendocardium and be consistent
with a coronary artery perfusion territory
ii) Non-CAD-type: Usually spares the
subendocardium and is limited to the mid-wall or
epicardium, although non-CAD-type should be
considered if subendocardial involvement is
global [35,36].
e) Interpret location and extent using AHA 17-
segment model [7].
i) Comparison of LGE images should be made with
cine and perfusion images (if the latter are
obtained) to correctly categorize ischemia and
viability [25]
ii) Estimate average transmural extent of LGE within
each segment (0%, 1-25%, 26-50%, 51-75%, 76-
100%) [34].
Schulz-Menger et al. Journal of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance 2013, 15:35 Page 8 of 19
http://jcmr-online.com/content/15/1/35

iii) In patients with acute myocardial infarction,
include subendocardial and mid-myocardial
hypoenhanced, no-reflow zones as part of infarct
size
f ) Pitfalls
i) Check for artifacts
– Verify regions with LGE in at least one
other orthogonal plane and/or in the same
plane obtain a second image after changing
the direction of readout
– Bright ghosting artifacts can result from poor
ECG gating, poor breath-holding, and long T1
species in the imaging plane (e.g. cerebrospinal
fluid, pleural effusion, gastric fluid, etc.) [37]
ii) On non-PSIR (phase sensitive inversion recovery)
images, tissue with long T1 (regions below the
zero-crossing) may appear enhanced [34,38].
iii)Occasionally, it can be difficult to distinguish no￾reflow zones or mural thrombus from viable
myocardium. Post-contrast cine imaging may be
helpful in this regard.
iv) In case of reduced contrast, the interpretation of
additional sequences may be necessary.
2. Quantitative analysis
a) Quantitative analysis is primarily performed to
measure LGE extent and/or “grey-zone” extent for
research purposes. Subjective visual assessment is
still a prerequisite to identify poor nulling,
artifacts, no-reflow zones, etc, and to draw
endocardial and epicardial borders.
b) Multiple different methods of delineating LGE
extent are described in the literature, including:
manual planimetry, the “n”-SD technique, and the
full width half maximum (FWHM) technique
(see 3) [39-42].

for quantitative assessment
3. Research tools / Quantitative analysis
a) Quantification of LGE extent:
i) Manual planimetry:
– Outline endocardial and epicardial borders
– Manual planimetry of LGE regions in each
slice
– Summation of LGE areas
– Multiplication of total LGE area with slice
thickness plus interslice gap as well as specific
gravity of myocardium provides the
approximate LGE weight, which can be used
to calculate the ratio of LGE to normal
myocardium
– considered subjective
ii) The “n”-SD technique:
– Outlining of endocardial and epicardial
borders for the myocardial ROI.
– Selection of a normal “remote” (dark) region
ROI within the myocardium to define the
reference SI (mean and standard deviation,
SD). This subjective approach can affect
measurements.
– Is susceptible to spatial variations in surface
coil sensitivity.
Figure 4 Late enhancement imaging. Role of inversion time in late enhancement imaging: On the left panel, normal myocardium has a faint
“etched” appearance (darkest at the border with higher image intensity centrally) signifying an inversion time that was set too short and which
will lead to underestimation of LGE. On the right panel, the image was repeated with a longer inversion time and demonstrates a larger LGE
zone in the inferior wall. Always use the longest inversion time possible that still nulls normal myocardium.
Schulz-Menger et al. Journal of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance 2013, 15:35 Page 9 of 19
http://jcmr-online.com/content/15/1/35

– Selection of a threshold between normal
myocardium and LGE. The relative SNR of
scar tissue versus normal myocardium can
vary dependent on contrast agent type, dose
and time after injection, field strength, type of
sequence and other variables including the
underlying injury itself. As such, there is no
cutoff value, which works for all situations and
usually manual tracing is performed as the
standard of truth. But (semi-)automated
thresholding may improve reproducibility after
adequate standardization. As a starting point
for semiautomatic thresholding we
recommend n+5SD for infarction and n+3SD
for myocarditis.
– The presence of LGE within the myocardium
is then determined automatically
– requires manual corrections to include
no-reflow zones and to exclude artifacts and
LV blood pool (errors in the endocardial
contour)
iii) FWHM technique:
– Outlining of endocardial and epicardial
borders for the myocardial ROI
– Uses the full width of the myocardial ROI SI
histogram at half the maximal signal within
the scar as the threshold between normal
myocardium and LGE
– Determination whether LGE is present or not,
and, if LGE is present, selection of a ROI that
includes the “maximum” signal. This subjective
selection can affect measurements.
– Is also susceptible to spatial variations in
surface coil sensitivity, albeit perhaps less so
than the “n”-SD technique [40].
– Considered more reproducible than the n-SD
technique [42].
– Since technique assumes a bright LGE core,
may be less accurate than the “n”-SD
technique if LGE is patchy or grey [43]
– Requires manual corrections to include
no-reflow zones and to exclude artifacts
and LV blood pool (errors in the
endocardial contour)
b) Peri-infarct" zone: [44,45]
– multiple methods of quantifying the extent of
grey zones are reported.
– The Task Force is not able to provide a dedicated
statement at this time due to a lack of consensus
available from the published literature.
– can account for spatial variations in coil sensitivity
c) T1 mapping: [46-49]
– may be helpful in identifying diffuse myocardial
fibrosis
– may provide a quantitative assessment of the
extent of fibrosis
– multiple sequences and imaging protocols are
described in the literature
– as the research application(s) are evolving and
consensus evidence is being accumulated, the
Task Force chooses to refrain from making a
specific recommendation at this time
Post processing of T2-weighted imaging
1. Visual analysis
a) The visual analysis should aim for detecting or
excluding regions with significant SI increase,
indicating increased free water content.
b) Qualitative, visual analysis of myocardial SI may be
sufficient for diseases with regional injury to the
myocardium such as acute coronary syndromes/
infarction (Figure 5), early stages of myocarditis and
sarcoidosis.
c) Work-flow:
i) Identify and display appropriate image(s)
ii) Modify image contrast and brightness to minimize
SI in a background noise area (noise should still be
detectable) and to reduce the maximal SI displayed
to an area with the highest SI without allowing for
“over-shining” with erroneous display of pixels as
white
iii)Check for artifacts
d) Criteria for edema:
i) Clearly detectable high SI area
ii) Respecting anatomical borders
iii) Following an expected regional distribution pattern
(mainly subendocardial, transmural, mainly
subepicardial, focal)
iv) Verifiable in two perpendicular views
e) High SI areas suggestive of myocardial edema
should be compared to
i) regional function
ii) other tissue pathology such as irreversible injury:
scar/fibrosis, infiltration
f ) Pitfalls of visual analysis:
i) Surface coil reception field inhomogeneity: The
uneven distribution of the sensitivity of the
receiver in surface coil may lead to false low SI in
segments most distant to the coil surface or false
high SI in segments closest to the coil surface,
especially in dark-blood triple-inversion recovery
spin echo (STIR, TIRM) images. Therefore, the
body coil or a reliable and accurate correction
algorithm should be used to ensure a
homogeneous signal reception.
ii) Low SI artifacts: Arrhythmia or through-plane
motion of myocardium may cause artifacts, making
Schulz-Menger et al. Journal of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance 2013, 15:35 Page 10 of 19
http://jcmr-online.com/content/15/1/35

large areas appear with false low SI, especially in
dark-blood triple-inversion recovery spin echo
images.
iii)High SI artifacts: In dark-blood triple-inversion
recovery spin echo images, slow flowing blood may
lead to insufficient flow suppression and results in
high SI, which may be confused with myocardial
edema.
2. Semi-quantitative analysis
a) Because low SI artifacts can lead to SI distribution
patterns similar to extensive myocardial edema, a
mere visual analysis may lead to incorrect results. SI
quantification with reference regions is much less
sensitive to these errors and therefore is
recommended.
b) Requirements:
i) Tested normal values for SI values or ratios.
c) Work-flow
i) Global SI analysis:
– Outline LV endocardial and epicardial
contours.
– For the T2 SI ratio, draw the contour for a
ROI in a large area of the skeletal muscle
closest to the heart and to the center of the
reception field of the coil (for short axis views
preferably in the M. serratus anterior).
ii) Regional SI analysis:
– Draw the contour for a ROI in the affected
area and divide the SI by that of the skeletal
muscle.
iii)While a cut-off of 1.9 can be used for dark￾blood triple-inversion recovery spin echo [50],
a locally established value is recommended,
because SI and ratio values may vary between
sequence settings (especially echo time (TE)) and
scanner models. For these images, a color-coded
map, based on the parametric calculation and
display of myocardial pixels with a SI ratio of 2 or
higher, can also be used.
3. Quantitative analysis
a) Research areas / advanced imaging
i) T2 mapping [51]:
– can account for spatial variations in coil
sensitivity
– multiple sequences and imaging protocols are
described in the literature
– may provide quantitative measurements of
edema
– as research application(s) are evolving and
consensus evidence is being accumulated, the
Task Force chooses to refrain from making a
dedicated statement at this time
Post processing of T2* imaging
1. Visual analysis
T2* imaging always requires a quantitative analysis. Visual
analysis is used to ensure optimal image quality, which is
the most important factor in the accuracy of data analysis.
2. Quantitative analysis
a) Evaluation of T2* always requires a quantitative
analysis using software with regulatory approval for
T2* evaluation in patients
b) Full thickness ROI defined of the ventricular septum
i) Take care to avoid blood pool and proximal blood
vessels
ii) Septal ROI avoids susceptibility artifact from
tissue interfaces

T2-weighted image (short-tau inversion recovery, STIR) in a midventricular short axis view with increased SI in the affected segments. Right: LGE
image in the same orientation.
Schulz-Menger et al. Journal of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance 2013, 15:35 Page 11 of 19
http://jcmr-online.com/content/15/1/35

c) Mean myocardial SI from the ROI is plotted against
TE (Figure 6)
i) SI falls with increasing TE
ii) A mono-exponential curve is fitted to the data
iii)The time for the decay of SI falls (shorter T2*)
with increasing iron burden
iv) In heavily iron overloaded patients, SI for higher
TEs may fall below background noise causing the
curve to plateau and underestimating T2*.
v) This can be compensated for by:
– Truncating the curve by removing later echo
times (Figure 6e) [52,53]
– This issue is not significant when using the
double inversion recovery (black blood)
sequence [54]
d) Cut-off values (at 1.5 Tesla):
i) Normal cardiac T2* is 40ms [55]
ii) T2* < 20 ms = cardiac iron overload [56]
iii)T2* <10ms indicates increased risk of
development of heart failure [57]
e) CMR assessment of T2* at 3T for assessment of iron
overload cardiomyopathy cannot be recommended at
this time. T2* shortens with increasing field strength
making assessment of severe iron overload more
problematic, and there is a lack of clinical verification.
Flow image interpretation and post processing
1. Visual analysis
a) Appropriately aligned acquisitions of cines and
stacks of cines can give valuable information on flow
in relation to adjacent structures, notably on the
directions, time courses and approximate
dimensions of jets resulting from valve regurgitation,
stenoses or shunts. Such information can be
important in assessing the credibility of
Figure 6 T2* imaging to assess myocardial iron overload. a) T2* scan of a normal heart showing slow signal loss with increasing TE.
b) Decay curve for normal heart. T2* = 33.3ms. c) Heavily iron overloaded heart. Note there is substantial signal loss at TE = 9.09. d) Decay curve
for heavily iron overloaded heart showing rapid signal loss with increasing TE. The curve plateaus as myocardial SI falls below background noise.
e) Values for higher TEs are removed (truncation method) resulting in a better curve fit and a lower T2* value.
Schulz-Menger et al. Journal of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance 2013, 15:35 Page 12 of 19
http://jcmr-online.com/content/15/1/35

measurements of flow, which may be subject to
several possible sources of error. Gradient echo
cines differ somewhat from SSFP in terms of degrees
of signal augmentation or reduction attributable to
flow effects. Of note, SSFP can provide clear
delineation between the relatively bright signal from
voxels aligned within the coherent core of a jet, and
low signal from the shear layer that bounds such a
jet core. In- or through-plane phase contrast flow
velocity acquisitions can also provide visual
information on the directions, dimensions and time
courses of flow; it can also image morphology,
which can yield a clue to the etiology of an
abnormal jet (e.g. imaging accelerated flow jet of a
coarctation or of valve insufficiency, or flow
direction across an atrial septal defect or Fontan
fenestration (Figure 7)) [58,59].
b) Pitfalls:
i) Flow appearances on both cine and phase
encoded acquisitions are highly dependent on
image location and orientation, especially in the
case of jet flow
ii) If the range of velocity encoding (VENC) is set
too high, visualization of the jet may not be
obtained. If it is set too low, a mosaic pattern on
the images will be visualized [60].
iii) If slice thickness is too large on in-plane velocity
mapping, the higher velocities will be “averaged
out” with the lower velocities and stationary tissue;
jets and flow may not be visualized correctly.
iv) If the annulus of valves is very dynamic or the
imaging plane is not set correctly, the valve
morphology may not be visualized.
v) If imaging in the presence of metal containing
devices, signal loss may be present as artifact and
interpretation must proceed with caution.
vi) The TE should be as low as possible for increased
accuracy, especially with high velocity turbulent
jets; this should be kept to 3.5 ms or lower [61].
2. Quantitative analysis
a) Work-flow:
i) Load phase and magnitude images into software.
Window the magnitude and phase images to the
appropriate brightness and contrast so that the
borders of the ROI are sharp.
ii) Examine the images to ensure the quality is
sufficient and that the VENC was not exceeded, or
there was little contrast (ie the VENC was too
high).
iii)Trace the borders of the vessel of interest on
each phase and magnitude image so that only the
cavity of the vessel is included (Figure 8); make
sure the noise outside the vessel is not included.
Check that this is performed correctly on the
Figure 7 Flow imaging in congenital heart disease. Visualizing flow across a fenestration in a single ventricle after Fontan. Upper left is the
magnitude image, upper right is the gradient echo image with a saturation band and lower left image is an inplane velocity map in the

Schulz-Menger et al. Journal of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance 2013, 15:35 Page 13 of 19
http://jcmr-online.com/content/15/1/35

magnitude images always keeping in mind that it
is the phase images that contain the encoded
information.
iv) Baseline-correction or comparison to a phantom
for flow measurements may be considered
[62,63].
v) Directly calculated parameters include: antegrade
volume, retrograde volume, peak velocity and
mean velocity
vi) Derived parameters include:
– Net volume [ml| = antegrade volume -
retrograde volume
– Regurgitant fraction [%] = ( retrograde volume
/ antegrade volume) * 100
– Cardiac output (liters/min = (net volume [ml]
x heart rate [beats/minute])/1000) and cardiac
index (cardiac output/BSA) when integrating
heart rate and body surface area
– Regional flow to both lungs by measuring
cardiac output in each branch pulmonary
artery (eg percentage of flow to the right lung
= (right pulmonary artery flow / right
pulmonary artery flow + left pulmonary artery
flow) × 100).
– Regurgitant volumes of the atrioventricular
valves may be obtained by either of 2
methods: A) direct measurement of diastolic
flow across the valve and subtraction of
systolic forward flow across the associated
semilunar valve or B) measurement of
stroke volume using cine CMR and
subtraction of forward flow across the
associated semilunar valve.
b) Pitfalls:
i) On the phase images, the area of flow may be
slightly larger than the area of the magnitude
images.
ii) If the VENC is exceeded, most software
packages allow for moving/changing the
“dynamic range” of the images so that the
VENC is not exceeded. For example, if the peak
velocity in the aorta is 175 cm/s and the VENC
was set at 150 cm/s, the dynamic range is
between -150 cm/s and +150 cm/s (i.e. 300 cm/s).
This may be moved to -100 cm/s and +200 cm/s to
account for this accelerated velocity. This will be
demonstrated on the graph of the velocity where
the phase in which the VENC is exceeded does not
“clip” (appears to go the wrong way) after
correction.
iii) In general, the area that exceeds the VENC in the
ROI is in the center of the vessel and not at the
Figure 8 Quantification of blood flow. (top) Contours were drawn delineating the aortic lumen at the sinotubular level during all 20 phases of
the cardiac cycle to assess aortic flow. (bottom) Flow curves from measurements in the ascending aorta and in the pulmonary artery in a patient

http://jcmr-online.com/content/15/1/35

edges; if at the edges, it is usually (but not always)
outside the vessel.
iv) If imaging in the presence of devices, signal loss
may be present as artifact and interpretation
must proceed with caution.
v) When measuring peak velocity, some software
packages will determine the peak velocity in one
pixel in the ROI whereas others may take the peak
velocity of the average of a few adjacent pixels in the
ROI. By reporting the peak velocity in a single pixel,
noise may make this measurement inaccurate. By
reporting this as an average of a few adjacent pixels,
noise is less of an issue, however, the true “peak
velocity” may be higher than the reported value.
These factors must be kept in mind and
interpretation may need to be adapted to the
measurement technique used.
vi)When attempting to measure peak velocity
using through plane velocity mapping along a
vessel, interpretation should be tempered by
the notion that this parameter may be an
underestimate as the true peak velocity lies
somewhere along the vena contracta; the
through plane velocity map may not have been
obtained at the level of the true peak velocity.
If the vena contracta is itself narrow or ill
defined, jet velocity mapping is unlikely to be
possible
vii) Peak velocity is only minimally affected by small
background phase offsets, while volume
measurements can be dramatically affected by even a
small background phase offset due to the cumulative
aspect of integration overspace (within the ROI) and
time (over the cardiac cycle). Dilatation of a great
vessel tends to increase error of this type [64].
viii)Orientation of the image plane perpendicular
to flow direction can have a significant impact
on peak velocity measurement, while not
significantly affecting volume flow [65].
3. Research tools
a) 4D flow: The utility of this approach is the subject of
ongoing research.
b) Real time velocity mapping: The utility and post
processing algorithm best applied to this approach is
the subject of ongoing research.
Post processing of angiography of thoracic aorta,
pulmonary arteries and veins
1. Visual analysis
a) Maximum intensity projections (MIP) for first
review of 3D data and for demonstration purposes
(Figure 9A). Volume rendered (VR) techniques may
be used for demonstration purposes, but not for
detailed analysis.
b) Aorta [67]:
i) Wall thickness: Review balanced steady state free
precession (bSSFP) or turbo spin echo images.
ii) Wall irregularities: Review 3D-MRA source
images and bSSFP or turbo spin echo.
c) Pulmonary arteries [68]:
i) Multiplanar double oblique and targeted MIP
reconstructions for assessment of wall adherent
thrombi, wall irregularities and abrupt diameter
changes.
d) Pulmonary veins [69]:
i) Screen for atypical insertion and small accessory
veins.

propagating into the left subclavian artery (arrowhead) with perfusion of both lumina.

http://jcmr-online.com/content/15/1/35

e) Coronary arteries:
i) Coronary MRA may play a role in assessment of
congenital anomalies but not usually in the
context of ischemic heart disease. The course of
coronary arteries is best assessed on source
images, multiplanar reconstructions (MPR) or
targeted MIP reconstructions.
2. Quantitative analysis
a) Aorta:
i) Multilevel measurements of aortic diameters on
double oblique multiplanar images perpendicular
to blood flow at standardized levels (Figure 10)
[66]. Measurements should be obtained at
diastole if possible.
ii) Inner diameter (lumen width). In the presence of
wall thickening (e.g. thrombus or intramural
hematoma) outer diameter including vessel walls
should also be reported.
iii)Diameters of sinuses or sinotubular junction may
not be measured on ungated images since motion
artifacts can lead to blurring and may result in
diameter under- or overestimation. These require
ECG gated acquisitions, either from 3-dimensional
SSFP acquired in late diastole, or from a
contiguous stack of cines aligned to transect the
axis of the aortic root. Consistent methods of
acquisition and measurement are essential for the
evaluation of any change over time, for example by
the measurement in late diastole, of all three sinus￾commissure dimensions of the aortic root, which
may dilate asymmetrically.
iv) Standardized report including table of diameters.
b) Pulmonary artery:
i) The widest inner diameter is measured
perpendicular to the long axis of the main
pulmonary artery at the level of the pulmonary
bifurcation in transaxial slices
c) Pulmonary veins:
i) MPR of pulmonary veins perpendicular to blood
flow for diameter measurements.
