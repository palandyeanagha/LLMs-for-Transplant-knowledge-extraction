Background and aim: In acute liver failure (ALF), the brain is exposed to high levels of ammonia. Human
studies defining the clinical significance of ammonia in ALF are lacking. This prospective study evaluated
the relationship of arterial ammonia levels at admission to complications and survival among patients with
ALF.
Methods: Eighty consecutive ALF patients admitted from March 2001 to December 2003 were followed up
until death or complete recovery. All had arterial ammonia estimation at admission (enzymatic method).
Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of mortality.
Results: Forty two (52.5%) patients died. Non-survivors had significantly higher median ammonia levels
than survivors (174.7 v 105.0 mmol/l; p,0.001). An arterial ammonia level of > 124 mmol/l was found
to predict mortality with 78.6% sensitivity and 76.3% specificity, and had 77.5% diagnostic accuracy.
Patients with higher ammonia levels also developed more complications, including deeper encephalopathy
(p = 0.055), cerebral oedema (p = 0.020), need for ventilation (p,0.001), and seizures (p = 0.006).
Logistic regression analysis showed that pH, presence of cerebral oedema, and arterial ammonia at
admission were independent predictors of mortality (odds ratios 6.6, 12.6, and 10.9, respectively).
Incorporating these variables, a score predicting mortality risk at admission was derived: 2.53 + 2.91
ammonia + 2.41 oedema + 1.40 pH, where ammonia is scored as 0 (if ,124 mmol/l) or 1 (if
>124 mmol/l); oedema is scored as 0 (absent) or 1(present); and pH is scored as 1 (if (7.40) or 0 (if
.7.40). Levels of partial pressure of ammonia were equally correlated with outcome.
Conclusion: Arterial ammonia at presentation is predictive of outcome and can be used for risk
stratification. Ammonia lowering therapies in patients with ALF should be evaluated.
Ammonia neurotoxicity is an important component of
cerebral dysfunction in patients with liver failure.1–4
Higher ammonia levels are found in patients with
acute liver failure (ALF) compared with those with compen￾sated and decompensated cirrhosis.5 The brain is exposed to
high ammonia concentration in ALF, and unidirectional
brain ammonia uptake has been well documented.1
Ammonia exposure induces multiple cellular abnormalities
in the brain such as impaired bioenergetics and neurotrans￾mission, astrocyte swelling, excitotoxicity, oxidative and
nitrosative stress, and increased neuro-steroid biosyn￾thesis.2–4
ALF has a high mortality with most non-survivors
succumbing soon after admission. The natural course of the
disease is often interrupted by liver transplantation and liver
replacement therapies. Therefore, dissecting out the role of
any single factor such as ammonia is difficult. Despite
impressive progress at the molecular level, it is still not
known if ammonia levels are related to cerebral dysfunction
or patient outcome. To date, only one human study has
reported that high ammonia levels among ALF patients are
associated with subsequent cerebral herniation.5 If these
observations are validated, use of ammonia lowering
therapies in such patients would have a rational basis.
Ammonia predominantly exists in an ionised form (NH4
+
)
in the blood. Only a small pH dependent fraction, reflected by
the partial pressure of ammonia (pNH3), exists in a diffusible
form.6 No data comparing total ammonia levels and pNH3
exist for ALF patients.
We therefore studied 80 conservatively managed ALF
patients until recovery or demise, to determine the relation￾ship between ammonia levels and patient outcome. We also
created a mortality risk score by incorporating ammonia
levels at admission, and compared the prognostic value of
simultaneously estimated total ammonia levels and pNH3
levels.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patients
A total of 103 consecutive patients with ALF admitted to the
gastroenterology ward of the All India Institute of Medical
Sciences, New Delhi, during March 2001 to December 2003,
were evaluated for inclusion. ALF was diagnosed according to
the criteria laid down by the International Association for the
Study of Liver.7 Twenty three patients were excluded because
of diagnostic uncertainty at presentation or because of prior
administration of ammonia lowering therapies, sedative
drugs, or enteral alimentation. Hence a total of 80 patients
with ALF were included in the study. In nine patients,
arterial pH and ammonia levels could not be estimated in the
same sample, and hence pNH3 levels were available for 71
ALF patients.
Study variables
ALF was defined by the occurrence of encephalopathy within
four weeks of onset of symptoms in the absence of pre￾existing liver disease.7–9 The diagnosis was confirmed by the
presence of submassive or massive necrosis in the post
mortem liver biopsy specimen of patients who died.
Pre-encephalopathy and icterus encephalopathy periods
were defined as the interval from the onset of prodrome and
jaundice, respectively, to the onset of hepatic encephalopathy.8 9

Admission to death interval was defined as the time interval
from admission to death among non-survivors. Awake time
was defined as the period between admission and improvement
to grade 0 encephalopathy.
Grading of encephalopathy8 10 was done as follows:
N Grade 1: loss of sleep rhythm, drowsiness, confusion, and
flapping tremors.
N Grade 2: features of grade 1 encephalopathy with loss of
sphincter control in addition.
N Grade 3: unconsciousness with no response to oral
commands but responding to painful stimuli.
N Grade 4: deep unconscious state with no response to pain.
Cerebral oedema was defined clinically by the presence of
spontaneous or inducible decerebrate posturing or by the
presence of any two of the following: hypertension (blood
pressure .150/90 mm Hg), bradycardia, pupillary changes,
or neurogenic hyperventilation.8 9
Infection was diagnosed by the presence of pyrexia
(temperature .101˚F) or hypothermia (temperature ,98˚F)
and neutrophil leucocytosis (total leucocyte count .15 000/
mm3
, with >80% polymorphs), and one or more of the
following: positive blood culture, positive urine culture, or
radiological evidence of pneumonitis.8 9
Renal failure was diagnosed if patients developed
decreased urine output (,400 ml in 24 hours), with serum
creatinine .1.5 mg/dl and blood urea .40 mg/dl, despite
hydration, objectively assessed by central venous pressure of
10 cm of saline or more.
Methods
All patients were admitted to the gastroenterology intensive
care unit and a uniform management protocol was followed.
History was obtained from the attendants of the patient and
a detailed clinical examination was performed at admission.
All patients were subsequently evaluated every two hours.
Each patient had continuous non-invasive cardiac oxygen
saturation and blood pressure monitoring. Blood glucose was
monitored two hourly. Neurological assessment was done
once daily and on any sign of deterioration. The parameters
noted were: grade of encephalopathy, presence of spontan￾eous or induced decerebration, pupillary size and reaction,
and presence of any focal neurological deficit. Complete
blood counts, biochemistry, and body fluid surveillance
cultures were obtained daily.
Each patient was treated with prophylactic parenteral
antibiotics (cefotaxime and cloxacillin), stress ulcer prophy￾laxis, and inotropic support, with the aim of maintaining
mean arterial pressure at more than 60 mm Hg. Elective
ventilation was used for all patients in grade 4 encephalo￾pathy and those in grade 3 encephalopathy with evidence of
cerebral oedema. Sedation or long acting muscle paralysing
agents were not used in any patient. Cerebral oedema was
managed conservatively by mannitol given in standard doses.
Seizures were initially treated with diazepam and an
additional mannitol bolus, followed by phenytoin.
Lactulose or other ammonia lowering therapies were not
used in any case. Enteral feeding was not initiated in the
initial three days in any patient. Liver transplantation and
liver replacement therapies were unavailable and all patients
were followed up until recovery or demise.
Viral markers
Serum samples from each patient were tested for hepatitis B
surface antigen, IgM antibody against hepatitis B core
antigen, and IgM antibody against hepatitis A virus using
commercial immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test kits
(Organon, Teknika, Netherlands). IgM antibody to ORF-1,
ORF-2, and ORF-3 of hepatitis E virus, and hepatitis E virus
RNA were tested by methods developed at our institute.11 12
Anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody was tested by using a
third generation commercial ELISA (Xcyton, Bangalore,
India) method. HCV-RNA was tested by reverse transcription
nested polymerase chain reaction, using primers from the 59
non-translated region, if appropriate, by methods described
previously.11 12
Estimation of ammonia
Arterial ammonia was estimated within 24 hours of admis￾sion by an enzymatic method (Randox Lab Ltd, UK) in
heparinised plasma. The assay was based on the reaction of
ammonia with a-oxoglutarate in the presence of glutamate
dehydrogenase to yield glutamate and NAD+
. The normal
ammonia value for the assay used was 10–47 mmol/l. Samples
were obtained before the next dose of mannitol if possible,
and with the ventilator settings unaltered for a minimum of
one hour. The site of sampling was the radial artery in all
cases. pH and bicarbonate levels were also obtained from the
same sample. All samples were transported in ice and
processed within 15 minutes.
Estimation of partial pressure (pNH3) of ammonia 13
Combining the mass balance equation and Henry’s law, the
formula for p[NH3] can be derived as:
(p[NH3]=KH 6[NH3]T) / (1 + [H+
]/Ka)
where [NH3]T = total blood ammonia, KH for ammonia =
1.7561025
, Ka = 9.8 6 10210, and [H+
] is derived from the
pH values, as antilog (2pH).
Data analysis and statistics
Skewness of data distribution was checked before analysis.
Median values and range are provided for skewed data.
Survivors and non-survivors were compared using the Mann￾Whitney U test for continuous variables and the x2 or Fishers
test for discrete variables, wherever applicable. The level of

significance was set at p = 0.05. A receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curve was made using the outcome
variable as death and admission arterial ammonia levels as
the independent variable to find out an appropriate cut off
ammonia value for predicting mortality.14 Sensitivity, speci￾ficity, and odds ratio (OR) for the cut off value were also
derived.
Univariate analysis of all relevant clinical and biochemical
variables that may influence mortality was carried out. The
significant variables were dichotomised using discriminant
values derived by constructing ROC curves for each variable,
and tested using forward stepwise logistic regression analysis
taking a probability of 0.15 to enter the covariates into the
model and 0.10 to exclude the covariate from the model. OR
with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) and diagnostic
accuracy for each predictor was calculated.
The predicted probability of outcome (mortality) was
derived from the variables found to be significant on logistic
regression analysis using the equation15:
PX = 1/(1+e2Z
)
where PX = probability of outcome (mortality),
Z = a + b1X1 + b2X2 + b3X3 ………. bnXn,
where a is the constant, b is an unknown parameter, and X
(12n) is the covariate.
An ROC curve for the predicted probability of death was
made to derive area under the curve.
The 22 log likelihood ratios function for total ammonia
and pNH3 were estimated from multivariate analysis of
patients with available simultaneous estimations. The differ￾ence between the ratios was compared as the x2 value at two
degrees of freedom for the significance level. Statistical
software SPSS (version 10; SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA)
and STATA (version 8.0) were used for statistical analysis.
RESULTS
Baseline clinical and biochemical characteristics of the
patients, and aetiology of ALF are summarised in table 1.
Over 80% of cases had a viral aetiology. Acute hepatitis E
infection, either alone or as dual infection, was the most
common cause (53.5% cases).
Forty two (52.5%) patients died. Median time from
admission to death was 4.0 days (range 1–17). Awake time
among survivors was 4.0 days (range 1–12 days). Infection
occurred in 47 (58.8%) patients. Mechanical ventilation was
required in 40 (50.0%) cases. Raised blood urea levels
(.40 mg/dl) were present in 17 patients at admission. Of
them, 12 normalised their renal parameters with hydration
alone and five had renal failure. Overall, renal failure
occurred in 11 (14.1%) patients during the course of their
illness, all of whom died. Ongoing uncontrolled infection was
present in 10 of these patients.
Ammonia levels at admission
Median arterial ammonia level at admission was 128.6 mmol/l
(range 9.3–735.0). Fifteen (18.8%) patients had ammonia levels
within the normal range (,47 mmol/l) at admission.
Prognostic value of ammonia levels
Median ammonia levels were significantly higher among
non-survivors than survivors (174.7 v 105.0 mmol/l;
p,0.001), as shown in fig 1. An ROC curve with ammonia
levels of each patient as the independent variable and
mortality as the outcome variable was made (fig 2). The
area under the ROC curve was 0.76 (95% CI 0.65–0.87). An
arterial ammonia level of >124 mmol/l was found to be 78.6%
sensitive and 76.3% specific for predicting mortality, with a
diagnostic accuracy of 77.5%. Thirty three (78.6%) of 42 non￾survivors and only nine (23.7%) of 38 survivors had ammonia
levels .124 mmol/l at initial presentation (p,0.001).
Ammonia levels and complications
Patients with ammonia levels above the derived cut off value
of 124 mmol/l had a higher frequency of cerebral oedema
(p = 0.020) and deeper encephalopathy grades at admission
(p = 0.055). These patients also developed other complica￾tions such as need for ventilation (p = ,0.001), seizures
(p = 0.006), and renal failure (p = 0.009) more often com￾pared with patients with lower ammonia levels (table 2).
Ammonia levels and cerebral dysfunction
At presentation, patients with grade 3 or 4 encephalopathy
had higher median ammonia levels than patients with grade
1 or 2 encephalopathy (148.3 v 105.0 mmol/l, respectively;
p = 0.021). Similarly, patients with clinical cerebral oedema
at presentation had higher median ammonia levels than
patients without overt cerebral oedema, although the
difference did not reach statistical significance (156.0 v
119.0 mmol/l; p = 0.064).
Ammonia levels and biochemical parameters
No correlation was found between ammonia levels and
aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, pro￾thrombin time prolongation, pH, bicarbonate, urea levels, or
albumin. Only bilirubin levels were found to correlate with
ammonia levels (Pearson’s correlation coefficient 0.29,
p = 0.01).

non-survivors). Seizures in these patients were recalcitrant to

standard antiseizure medications and were uniformly fatal.
All patients had features of cerebral oedema when seizures
occurred, and no contributing metabolic factor was found.
Patients admitted with higher ammonia levels had a
significantly higher seizure incidence (table 2). Fifteen of
43 (35%) patients with ammonia levels >124 mmol/l devel￾oped seizures compared with three of 37(8%) patients with
ammonia levels ,124 mmol/l (p = 0.006).
Ammonia levels and time to death
Ammonia levels were not correlated with time to death
among the non-survivors (Pearson’s correlation coefficient
0.013, p = 0.936). The 23 patients who died early (within four
days) and the 19 patients who died later had similar median
ammonia levels at admission (172.9 v 186.0 mmol/l;
p = 0.723).
Comparison of survivors and non-survivors
Thirteen clinical and biochemical variables were found to
significantly influence outcome on univariate analysis
(table 3). Of these 13 variables, infection, need for ventilation,
and renal failure developed in most patients subsequent to
admission. Hence these three factors were excluded, and only
those variables were included in the multivariate analysis that
would be available at the initial evaluation. Additionally, since
development of seizures was universally predictive of mortality,
it could not be used as a covariate. A total of nine remaining
variables were analysed using forward stepwise logistic regres￾sion analysis, taking death as the dependent variable (survi￾val = 0, death = 1). These variables were dichotomised for best
discrimination between survivors and non-survivors using cut
off values derived by the construction of individual ROC curves
(table 3). Three variables, arterial pH (7.40, presence of clinical
cerebral oedema, and arterial ammonia levels >124 mmol/l
were found to be significantly predictive of death on multi￾variate analysis. The adjusted OR and diagnostic accuracy of
these three variables are given in table 3.
Predicted probability of death
Using the formula for Z values given earlier and the results of
logistic regression, the derived value for Z was found to be:
22.53 + 2.91 ammonia + 2.41 oedema + 1.40 pH

where ammonia was scored as 1 if it was >124 mmol/l and 0
if it was ,124 mmol/l, oedema was scored as 1 if present and
0 if absent, and pH was scored as 1 if (7.40 and 0 if .7.40.
The Z value was calculated for each case and the predicted
probability of death was derived using the equation:
PX = 1/(1+e2Z
)
as described earlier. An ROC curve was made from the
individual derived probability scores as the independent
variable and mortality as the dependent variable. The area
under the ROC curve was found to be 0.93 (fig 3).
Comparative prognostic value of total ammonia and
pNH3
The prognostic value of pNH3 levels and total ammonia levels
at admission was compared in 71 patients in whom
simultaneous estimations were available. In common with
total ammonia, median pNH3 levels were significantly higher
among non- survivors compared with survivors (9.0061025 v
4.7361025 mm Hg; p,0.001). From the ROC curves con￾structed with mortality as outcome variable, it was found
that the area under the curve for both total ammonia and
pNH3 levels were similar (fig 4). Additionally, by using
multivariate logistic regression analysis the 22 log likelihood
ratios for total ammonia and pNH3 were found to be 46.7 and
49.8, respectively, which were not significantly different at
two degrees of freedom.
DISCUSSION
We have defined the clinical utility of ammonia levels among
patients with ALF. The advantage of our study cohort was its
homogenous aetiology, with viral hepatitis as the cause in
over 80% of cases (table 1), similar to previously reported
studies from our centre.8 16 In Western series, the aetiological
profile of patients was heterogeneous.17–19 Drug induced and
non A–E hepatitis induced ALF have been repeatedly
associated with a poorer prognosis.20 21 In addition, a uniform
treatment protocol was followed in all cases. No patient was
given enteral feedings for the initial 72 hours, or ammonia
lowering therapies, which would have confounded inter￾pretation of ammonia levels. In the only published human
study relating ammonia to outcome, all patients were already
on lactulose when ammonia levels were estimated, and a
subgroup was being treated with N-acetyl cysteine.5 Liver
transplantation was not available at our centre at the time of
study, and all patients were followed up to survival or
demise. Such studies would not be ethically possible at
Western centres.
We found that ammonia levels at admission were
significantly higher among non-survivors than survivors
(fig 1, table 3). The majority of the patients were stratified
for mortality risk by a cut off ammonia level of 124 mmol/l
(fig 2). This observation was further supported by the fact
that those patients whose ammonia levels were above
124 mmol/l within 24 hours of hospitalisation had advanced
encephalopathy, a higher frequency of overt cerebral oedema,
renal failure, infection, and seizures. Each of these complica￾tions was associated with higher mortality among ALF
patients (table 2). Clemmesen et al had reported higher
ammonia levels in 14 patients with ALF related to acetamino￾phen toxicity, who later died from cerebral herniation, than
in 30 patients who survived. They found ammonia levels of
>146 mmol/l to be predictive of subsequent cerebral hernia￾tion.5 This was an arbitrary level which was chosen because
all patients who developed cerebral herniation had ammonia
levels higher than this level. No estimates of predictive
accuracy were provided. Furthermore, their time of ammonia
estimation was within 24 hours of developing grade 3
encephalopathy.5 While the time trends in ammonia levels
among ALF patients remain undefined, we found that
ammonia levels at admission itself can be used to predict
subsequent outcome. From a clinical viewpoint, it is
encouraging that single arterial ammonia estimations can
be so informative. However, multiple factors can influence
ammonia values, and a wide range of ammonia levels were
found. In the present study, 18.8% of patients had ammonia
levels within normal limits at presentation. Thus a single
normal ammonia value may not rule out the diagnosis of
ALF, or portend a favourable prognosis. More frequent
ammonia estimations may further refine the conclusions
determined in the present study.
Using logistic regression analysis, arterial pH, presence of
cerebral oedema, and arterial ammonia levels at admission
were predictive of mortality (table 3). We excluded infection,
need for ventilation, and renal failure because these factors
were absent at the time of hospitalisation, and any mortality
estimate incorporating these three variables would require
following the entire clinical course of the patient. Such risk
estimates would lack any practical utility. In our patients,
initial presentation with renal failure or sepsis was infre￾quent, and these complications usually developed later.
The adjusted OR for mortality attributable to ammonia was
10.9, which was similar to the OR of overt cerebral oedema in
the present study (table 3). The latter complication in ALF
has been documented as the major cause of death.5 8 18–22
Therefore, arterial ammonia levels may be used to identify
high risk patients for mortality during the early course of the
illness. From the multivariable analysis, a quantitative

estimate of mortality risk was derived, and was found to
adequately differentiate non-survivors from survivors. This is
depicted in fig 3, which illustrates the fit of the model.
However, the predictive ability of any score is expected to be
high when validated on the dataset used to generate the
score. Thus our prognostic model must be validated
prospectively in an external dataset. Another limitation of
our study was the small sample size available for analysis.
This means that our study had reduced power to detect
effects of a moderate size.
Prognostic criteria for ALF have been reported from both
the East and West.22 Both King’s College and Clichy criteria
had a positive predictive value of 0.89 and negative predictive
values of 0.47 and 0.36, respectively, when assessed in non￾transplanted patients with non-paracetamol induced ALF.23
No prognostic model to date has incorporated ammonia
levels. Any refinement of mortality estimate of ALF patients
would be of immense utility to allocate expensive treatment
options, such as liver transplantation. This model also
illustrates the fundamental conclusion drawn from this
study, that higher ammonia levels confer higher mortality
risk (table 2, fig 1).
Prolongation of prothrombin time has been identified as
one of the important prognostic variables among patients
with ALF in many studies. However, in the present study,
multivariate analysis did not find it to be an independent
predictor of mortality. It is possible that due to the smaller
sample size of the present study compared with previous
reports8 19–21 the association of prothrombin time prolonga￾tion with outcome was not evident. Furthermore, none of the
previous studies included ammonia as a covariate of
mortality. Arterial ammonia may have a stronger association
with outcome than prothrombin time, and may have masked
the influence of the latter factor, particularly when the
sample size was small in which only robust influencing
factors of prognosis are likely to be identified.
It has been stated that a relationship between biological
toxicity of ammonia and pH of the milieu is ‘‘universal
throughout nature from onion to man’’.6 However, pNH3 was
not superior to total arterial ammonia levels for prognostic
purposes among our ALF patients. As estimation of the
former is more cumbersome, total ammonia levels may
suffice for the purpose of risk stratification.
Despite the extensive supporting experimental literature,
the uncertain role of ammonia is reflected by the fact that
hepatology textbooks still state that therapies to lower
ammonia are of no use in ALF.24–27 While targeting the gut
to lower ammonia production by lactulose or antibiotics may
be too slow to influence the outcome in ALF, increasing
peripheral utilisation of ammonia by ornithine aspartate or
sodium benzoate may be useful. Rose et al reported that
ornithine aspartate infusion resulted in normalisation of
plasma ammonia and a significant decrease in brain water
content in rats with ALF.28 No comparable human data exist.
There is significant unidirectional blood to brain transfer of
ammonia in ALF, with brain-blood ammonia ratios increased
fourfold or more.29 Measures such as hypothermia, which
reduces this cerebral uptake of ammonia, have been
documented to decrease cerebral oedema and improve
encephalopathy.1 30 Therefore, higher ammonia levels may
lead to a greater degree of cerebral dysfunction in ALF. We
found significantly higher ammonia levels among patients
with deeper encephalopathy, as expected. While seizures
have been commonly reported in congenital hyperammonae￾mic syndromes, they are rarely reported in ALF.31–33 We do
not routinely paralyse or sedate ALF patients, and have
observed a high frequency of seizures among our ALF
patients.9 In this study, patients with ammonia levels
>124 mmol/l at admission had increased seizure frequency
(table 2). It is likely that this cut off value of ammonia
identified patients with advanced cerebral dysfunction. More
direct evidence is required to link ammonia levels and
seizures in patients with ALF.
In summary, we have demonstrated that high arterial
ammonia levels, measured within 24 hours of patient
presentation, are associated with a worse outcome among
patients with ALF. Our findings encourage viewing ALF as a
‘‘hyperammonaemic state’’, and provide a rational back￾ground for the use of ammonia lowering therapies.

EDITOR’S QUIZ: GI SNAPSHOT ..................................................................
Robin Spiller, editor Gastrointestinal bleeding: don’t overlook the role of the pancreas
Clinical presentation
A 59 year old man was admitted with a three day history of
haematemesis and malaena. He was known to suffer from
hyperlipidaemia and type II diabetes. He had a history of
acute gall stone pancreatitis complicated by pseudocyst
formation and treated with an open cystgastrostomy in
1996. He drank less than 20 units of alcohol/week and was a
non-smoker. His medication included aspirin, metformin,
and simvastatin. On admission he was hypotensive
(90/70 mm Hg) and tachycardic. There were no clinical signs
of stigmata of chronic liver disease. Abdominal examination
was unremarkable. On admission, haemoglobin was 4.4 g/dl,
international normalised ratio 1.4, urea 21.2 mmol/l, and
glucose 30.4 mmol/l. The patient was resuscitated with blood
and intravenous crystalloid and underwent an urgent upper
gastrointestinal endoscopy followed by an abdominal com￾puted tomography (CT) scan.
Question
What does the duodenal endoscopic image (fig 1) demon￾strate? What is shown on the abdominal CT scans (figs 2, 3)?
