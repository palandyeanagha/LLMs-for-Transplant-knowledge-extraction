on liver dysfunction
Zeng‑hong Wu and Dong‑liang Yang*
Abstract
Background: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by the severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is leading to a worldwide pandemic. Except representative manifestation of 
pneumonia and acute respiratory symptoms, COVID-19 patients have also shown different levels of liver injury or liver 
dysfunction. The aim of our study was to explore the probable clinical severity and mortality of COVID-19 patients and 
their liver dysfunction.
Method: A combination of computer and manual retrieval was used to search in Medline through PubMed, EMBASE 
and Web of Science. Review Manager 5.3 software was used to examine the heterogeneity among the studies and to 
calculate the combined effect value (OR, 95CI). Subgroup analysis, sensitivity analysis, and publication bias test were 
also performed.
Results: We found a significant connection between liver dysfunction and mortality of COVID-19 patients with a 
pooled OR of 1.98 (95% CI 1.39–2.82; P=0.0002). There was a significant association between AST and severity of 
COVID-19 with a pooled OR of 4.48 (95% CI 3.24–7.21; P<0.001), and a pooled WMD of 3.35 (95% CI, 2.07 to 4.64; 
P<0.001). In addition, there was a significant difference between TBIL and severity of COVID-19, with a pooled OR of 
1.91 (95% CI 1.40–2.60; P<0.001), and with a pooled WMD of 1.18 (95% CI, 0.78 to 1.58; P<0.001).
Conclusion: The mortality and severity of COVID-19 patients are significantly associated with liver dysfunction. 
The non-survivors and severe COVID-19 patients have elevated serum AST levels than the survivors and non￾severe COVID-19 patients. The results of this study form a basis for better clinical liver management of patients with 
COVID-19.

Background
Coronavirus (CoV) is an enveloped positive single￾stranded RNA virus. It is widely distributed in humans 
and animals. It is known to cause human respira￾tory infections [1]. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic 
caused by the new severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is rapidly developing 
[2]. COVID-19 is caused by a virus, SARS-COV-2, 
and its major symptoms are fever, cough, and dysp￾nea, and minor symptoms are alteration of the smell 
and taste, gastrointestinal symptoms, headache, and 
cutaneous manifestations [3–5]. SARS-CoV-2 enters 
cells through the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 
(ACE2) which is its intended receptor [6]. Currently, 
there are no specific/targeted drugs or vaccines for 
SARS-CoV-2. In many parts of the world, the number 
of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients are increasing expo￾nentially. As of 18th April, 2020, there were 2,251,633 
positive cases and 154,329 deaths worldwide. This 
suggested that the total death rate of COVID-19 was 
6.85%. Clinical symptoms of COVID-19 are pneumonia

and acute respiratory symptoms. However, COVID￾19 patients also have varying levels of liver injuries or 
liver dysfunction though the results are controversial. 
Yang et  al. reported that there were no differences in 
liver function among survivors and non-survivors of 
COVID-19 [7]. A recent study reported that 318 out 
of the 417 COVID-19 patients tested during hospitali￾zation had aberrant liver test results while 90 patients 
had liver injury. The use of ritonavir/lopinavir also 
increased the occurrence of liver injury [8]. Chen et al.
reported that there were liver enzyme abnormalities 
in 99 COVID-19 patients in Wuhan. Among the 99, 
43 (43.4%) had elevated aspartate aminotransferase 
(AST) and serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) [9]. 
However, in a cohort of 548 COVID-19 patients from 
mainland China, there were no significant differences 
in ALT levels between non-severe (n=279) and severe 
(n=269) patients (P=0.683) [10]. Similarly, Wan et al.
retrospectively studied 135 hospitalized COVID-19 
patients and reported that there were no significant 
differences in ALT (P =0.73) and total bilirubin (TBIL, 
P=0.07) between mild cases (n=95) and severe cases 
(n=40) [11]. These contradicting reports have now 
attracted widespread attention. As such, this meta￾analysis aimed to explore the probable clinical sever￾ity and mortality of COVID-19 patients and their liver 
dysfunction. The study further analyzed the likelihood 
of COVID-19 patients to have bad liver injuries. The 
results of this study will help researchers and clinicians 
in formulating stronger prevention guidelines as well as 
have effective responses to COVID-19. Ultimately, this 
will contribute to effective management and treatment 
of liver injuries.
Methods
Search summary
Studies involving SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 or liver 
injury/dysfunction were included. In order to find rel￾evant original articles, we conducted a comprehensive 
search in the database, involving Medline through Pub￾Med, EMBASE and Web of Science, and using the follow￾ing words: "COVID-19", "SARS-CoV-2", "Wuhan virus", 
"Chinese virus", "novel coronavirus 2019", "2019 nCoV", 
"Wuhan coronavirus", ``2019 Coronavirus", "Characteris￾tics", "Characteristics" and "Liver". As of April 17, 2020, 
the papers have been searched in the language range. We 
also refer to the recognized literature to find other quali￾fied research subjects. We first screened the article title 
and abstract, as well as publications that may involve 
data on COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 and liver injury/
dysfunction.
Inclusion and exclusion standard
This study had no national restrictions. All studies 
reporting on COVID-19 non-survivors/survivors, non￾severe/severe and laboratory confirmed COVID-19 
patient data were included in the study. Moreover, the 
studies had to be limited to humans, include raw data, 
be published in English and be in either abstract form or 
full text. Repeated studies, letters, case reports, abstracts, 
and comments were excluded from the study. Data col￾lected from each study included the year of publication, 
name of first author, sample size, and age of COVID-19 
patients.
Statistical analysis
The quality of each study was evaluated using the Newcas￾tle–Ottawa scale while the meta-analysis was conducted 
through the Review Manager 5.3 software. Heterogene￾ity was evaluated by calculating the I
2
 index. I
2
values less 
than 25%, 25–50%, 50–75% and 75–100% were homoge￾neous, or had low, medium, and high heterogeneity levels, 
respectively. The random effect model (REM) was applied 
if the I
2
 value is>50% while the fixed effect model (FEM) 
was applied if the I
2
 value is<50%. The combined odds 
ratio (OR) and weighted mean difference (WMD) of dif￾ferent studies with corresponding 95% confidence inter￾vals (CI) were used to assess the relationship between liver 
dysfunction and COVID-19. The sensitivity analysis was 
repeated to evaluate the impact of each study in the analy￾sis by subsequently excluding different individual studies 
each time. Based on the method of Hozo et al. [12], the 
mean and standard deviation were inferred from the sam￾ple size, median and interquartile range (IQR) when the 
continuous variables were not available.
Results
Study processing
Five hundred and eighty-five relevant articles and one 
from the reference list were identified. Exclusion of dupli￾cates brought down the number to 326 studies. The 326 
studies were further screened if they meet the inclusion 
criteria. This resulted in the exclusion of 270 studies. 
Forty-three more studies were excluded after scanning 
of the entire body text of the 56 remaining studies. The 
remaining 13 articles meet the eligibility criteria [7, 8, 10, 
11, 13–21]. The steps of document retrieval are shown in 
Fig.  1. Similarly, the study characteristics are shown in 
Tables  1 and 2. The meta-analysis involved 3,722 cases 
(285 dead vs 748 alive; 1968 non-severe vs 721 severe). 
All studies were conducted and published in 2020. One 
of the studies (Reference 4) was conducted in an ICU 

Wu and Yang Eur J Med Res (2020) 25:54 Page 3 of 9
setting while the remaining were conducted in isolation 
wards. In the same line, there was one study (Reference 
5) that had categorized patients based on abnormal liver 
test (Group A) and liver injury (Group B). All articles had 
a NOS score of six and above. This meant that they were 
all of high quality.

of COVID-19 patients with a pooled OR of 1.98 (95% CI 
1.39–2.82; P=0.0002). The pooled data were calculated 
under the FEM as a low heterogeneity within the studies. 
Pooled results of five studies revealed that AST was sig￾nificantly lower in COVID-19 survivors (WMD 3.72; 95% 
CI 2.74 to 4.71; P<0.001) (Fig. 2c). However, there were 
no significant differences in ALT levels between COVID￾19 survivors and non-survivors (WMD 1.34; 95% CI 
-0.47 to 3.16; P=0.15) (Fig. 2b).
Non‑severe vs severe based on ALT, AST and TBIL
Dichotomous and continuous analysis revealed that 
there was no significant association between ALT and 
severity of COVID-19 with a pooled OR of 1.38 (95% 
CI 0.84–2.27; P=21). However, ALT was significantly 
lower in patients with non-severe COVID-19 (WMD 
2.56; 95% CI 1.34 to 3.78; P<0.001) (Fig. 3). In the same 
line, there was a significant association between AST and 
severity of COVID-19 with a pooled OR of 4.48 (95% CI 
3.24–7.21; P<0.001), and a pooled WMD of 3.35 (95% 
CI, 2.07 to 4.64; P<0.001) (Fig.  4). Similarly, there was 
a significant association between TBIL and severity of 
COVID-19 with a pooled OR of 1.91 (95% CI 1.40–2.60; 
P<0.001), and a pooled WMD of 1.18 (95% CI 0.78 to 
1.58; P<0.001) (Fig. 5).
Subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis
Subgroup analysis was used to reveal the sources of het￾erogeneity. Age and the number of non-severe patients 
were found to be potential sources of heterogene￾ity (Table 3). However, the impact of age stratification 
should be verified further using bigger data sets because 
this study had a small data set. The overall mortality of 
COVID-19 had low heterogeneity (I
2=36%). However, 
when either Chen’s or Wang’s study was eliminated, 
the results significantly affect the pooled outcomes (I
2
dropped from 36 to 25%). Similarly, when Chen’s study 
was removed from the AST group, the I
2
 dropped from 
93 to 70%. In the same line, the severity of COVID-19 
in AST (events) had moderate heterogeneity (I
2=61%). 
However, when Li’s study was eliminated, the I
2
dropped from 61 to 49%. Similarly, when Zhang’s study 
was removed in the AST (levels) group, the I
2
 dropped 
from 97 to 79%. When Zhang’s study was removed in

the AST (events) group, the I
2
 dropped from 71 to 28%. 
In the TBIL (levels) group, removal of Zheng’s study 
led to reduction of the I
2
 from 71 to 67%. Cognizant of 
this, it was hypothesized that the studies of Zhang et al.
2020 and Zheng et al. 2020 were the sources of hetero￾geneity in this meta-analysis. The Egger’
s regression 
test (P > 0.05) further revealed that the meta-analysis 
had no significant publication bias.
Discussion
Herein, the abnormal liver function was associated 
with mortality and severity of COVID-19. Subgroup 
analysis conducted to identify sources of heterogeneity 
further revealed that the overall outcome was accept￾able. Similarly, sensitivity analysis revealed that when 
any study was excluded or REM was converted to FEM, 
the overall outcome was acceptable. These results

strongly suggested that there in a correlation between 
liver injury and COVID-19.
Although it has been observed that the most severe 
and fatal cases of COVID-19 occur in the elderly indi￾viduals with liver injury, the relevant pathophysiology 
is still unclear. Xu et  al [22] reported the pathological 
characteristics of the liver of a 50-year-old man who 
died from critical COVID-19. His liver had moder￾ate microvascular steatosis as well as mild lobular and 
portal activity. However, no histological features of 
liver failure and bile duct injuries have been observed 
until now. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to SARS-CoV 
by virtue of both sharing the same receptor (ACE2). 
However, there is no relevant study that has explored 
the role of ACE2 in liver injury especially in COVID￾19 patients given that majority of them usually have 
elevated serum aminotransferase. The over-activated 
immune response caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection and 
systemic inflammation associated with cytokine storms 
may lead to organ (liver) damage [23]. Qin et  al. [24] 
reported that most severe COVID-19 patients had ele￾vated biomarkers associated with infection, increased 
inflammatory cytokine levels, and decreased number of 
T cells. In addition, stress (such as shock, ARDS, and 
septic) or drug toxicity-induced liver injury might be 
associated with hypoxia reoxygenation, oxidative stress, 
and imbalance of acid–base. This also contributes to 
very high aminotransferase concentrations. None￾theless, studies have reported varying levels of ami￾notransferase. This meta-analysis revealed that there is 
a significant correlation between COVID-19 and liver 
dysfunction which provides a basis for better clinical 
management of COVID-19 and liver disease patients.
Patients aged above 65 years have higher comorbidities, 
more severe symptoms, and are more prone to multiple 
organ involvement and death compared to the younger 
patients [13]. For example, Feng et al. 2020 reported that 
the survival rate of patients aged above 75 years was sig￾nificantly lower than that of young patients [25]. Factors 
leading to poor health outcomes include physiological 
changes in aging and various age-related complications. 
Moreover, older people’s suspicion and detection thresh￾olds for SARS-2 such as temperature, decreased function 
of cough, and shortness of breath are lower [26]. Cogni￾zant of this, more attention should be paid to COVID-19 
patients with a history of liver disease (especially elderly 
patients) by constantly observing liver changes, and care￾fully determining the cause of liver abnormalities. Age 
subgroup analysis revealed that the age≥70 or age≥60 
subgroup is of great significance. However, further stud￾ies should be conducted on the effect of age stratification 
on the mortality and severity of patients with COVID-19 
combined with liver injury.
Previous studies quantify the effects of COVID-19 on 
the digestive system and chronic liver disease [27, 28]. 
While this meta-analysis to prove that there is an asso￾ciation between severity and mortality of COVID-19 
patients, and liver dysfunction. Nevertheless, this study 
was limited by several factors. Additional information 
such as liver disease types, drug use, nutritional lev￾els, and other indicators to assess liver function was not 
present. As such, stratifying the risk in subgroup analy￾sis of liver injury patient populations was not possible. 
In the same line, only the information regarding the age 
and gender of COVID-19 patients was collected. Other 
factors such as BMI, measurement methods and instru￾ments for detecting SARS-CoV-2, and sample size could 
have as well affected the accuracy of the results. Moreo￾ver, patients diagnosed with COVID-19 could have had 
multiple chronic diseases such as intestinal diseases and 
pre-existing liver disease that could have affected the 
accuracy of the results. As such, large-scale prospective 
studies should be conducted to verify these results.
Conclusion
The mortality and severity of COVID-19 patients are 
significantly associated with liver dysfunction. The non￾survivors and severe COVID-19 patients have elevated 
serum AST levels than the survivors and non-severe 
COVID-19 patients. The results of this study form a 
basis for better clinical liver management of patients with 
COVID-19.
