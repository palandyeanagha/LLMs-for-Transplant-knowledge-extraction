Abstract
The molecular and cellular basis of long-term T cell mem￾ory against viral antigens is still largely undefined. To char￾acterize anti-viral protection by memory T cells against
non-cytopathic viruses able to cause acute self-limited and
chronic infections, such as the hepatitis B virus (HBV), we
studied HLA class II restricted responses against HBV struc￾tural antigens in 17 patients with acute hepatitis B, during the
acute stage of infection and 2.2 to 13 yr after clinical resolu￾tion of disease. Results indicate that: (a) significant T cell
proliferative responses to HBV nucleocapsid antigens were
detectable in all patients during the acute phase of infection
and in 14/17 also 2–13 yr after clinical resolution of disease;
b) long-lasting T cell responses were sustained by CD45RO1T
cells, predominantly expressing the phenotype of recently
activated cells; c) limiting dilution analysis showed that in
some patients the frequency of HBV-specific T cells was
comparable to that observed in the acute stage of infection
and, usually, higher than in patients with chronic HBV in￾fection; d) the same amino acid sequences were recognized
by T cells in the acute and recovery phases of infection; and
e) HBV-DNA was detectable by nested-PCR in approxi￾mately half of the subjects.
In conclusion, our results show that vigorous anti-viral T
cell responses are detectable in vitro several years after clin￾ical recovery from acute hepatitis B. Detection of minute
amounts of virus in some recovered subjects suggests that
long-term maintenance of an active anti-viral T cell re￾sponse could be important not only for protection against
reinfection but also for keeping the persisting virus under
tight control. (J. Clin. Invest. 1996. 98:1185–1194.) Key

Introduction
An important property of the immune system is to remember
past infections; in this way it can afford a state of protection
against the pathogen eventually lasting after resolution of in￾fection (1–3). This property resides into the capacity of mem￾ory T cells to mount fast and vigorous secondary responses
upon re-exposure to the antigen. Accelerated and enhanced
memory responses are likely due not only to an intrinsic capac￾ity of memory cells to respond faster and more efficiently than
naive cells, but also to an increased frequency of antigen-reac￾tive cells with a less stringent dependence on costimuli for acti￾vation (2, 4, 5). Protection induced by natural infections or
vaccines is based on these mechanisms; in most instances, pro￾tection can last for years or even a lifetime, but immunity to
some pathogens or vaccines can be shorter (2, 5). Memory
functions at the B and T cell level are governed by different
rules and may have a different duration (2, 6, 7). Whether
long-term T cell memory following viral infections is main￾tained by long-lived T cell clones (8–10) or whether periodic
stimulation with antigen is required to induce division of spe￾cific T cells and to maintain their clonal progeny (11, 12) is still
debated.
After resolution of acute hepatitis B virus (HBV)1
 infec￾tion, humoral anti-viral responses can last for a lifetime, while
little is known about memory T cell responses against HBV
antigens. Previous studies indicated that traces of virus can
persist indefinitely following clinical recovery from hepatitis B
(13, 14). This suggests that clinical resolution does not neces￾sarily correspond to eradication of HBV and raises the possi￾bility that long-lasting T cell memory can be maintained by
chronic production of minute (and serologically undetectable)
amounts of antigen. If HBV persistence in recovered hosts is a
common event, even in the face of an immune response lead￾ing to disease resolution (15), life-long maintainance of an ac￾tive anti-viral T cell response could be important not only for
protection against reinfection but also for keeping the virus
under a tight and efficient control.
In this study we have followed viremia and HBV-specific T
cell responses several years after resolution of acute hepatitis
B. Results show that a memory T cell response against HBV
nucleocapsid antigen can last in most patients for years and
even decades although viremia becomes undetectable in some
of them.
Methods
Patients. 17 subjects (6 females and 11 males; mean age 41.5 yr) who
recovered from an episode of acute self-limited hepatitis B (mean time
from clinical onset, 5.362.2 yr) were studied (Table I). Diagnosis of
acute hepatitis was based on elevated serum glutamic pyruvic transam￾inase activity, detection of IgM anti-hepatitis B core antigen (anti￾Address correspondence to Carlo Ferrari, M.D., Cattedra Malattie

HBc) antibodies in the serum and the recent onset of jaundice and
other typical symptoms. All patients were negative for antibodies to
hepatitis C virus and to HIV-1, 2 with the exception of patient seven
(Table I) who was anti-hepatitis C virus positive. HBV infection was
probably related to sexual exposure at risk in five cases, two patients
were partners of chronic HBV carriers, one was infected during acute
hepatitis of the partner, one patient had surgery and blood transfusion,
two were health care workers, one was a drug abuser. For the remain￾ing five patients no clear cause of infection was established. All patients
normalized their transaminase levels within 12 wk and became nega￾tive for hepatitis B surface (HBsAg) and “e” (HBeAg) antigens.
10 healthy subjects (five males and five females; mean age
33.165.8) without evidence of exposure to HBV (i.e., negative for
HBsAg and anti-HBc antibodies) were selected as controls. T cell re￾sponses observed in subjects recovered from hepatitis B were also
compared with T cell responses to HBV envelope antigens and teta￾nus toxoid expressed by 15 anti-HBV and 17 anti-tetanus vaccine re￾cipients (4 females and 13 males; mean age 38.266 yr) (mean time
from the last vaccine dose, 5.762.9 yr and 8.866.3, respectively).
HBV antigens and synthetic peptides. A recombinant preparation
of hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) was obtained as described previ￾ously (16). Purity was . 95% as determined by scanning densitom￾etry of Coomassie blue stained SDS–polyacrylamide gel.
A HBcAg deletion mutant lacking the carboxyl-terminal 39-
amino acid residues of the core molecule was provided by Biogen
(Cambridge, MA) (17). Its purity was 99.8% and it is herein desig￾nated as HBeAg.
A purified preparation of HBV envelope antigens containing the
S, preS1, and preS2 region encoded determinants was provided by
Sorin Biomedica (Saluggia, Italy) (18). Tetanus toxoid was purchased
from Connaught Laboratories Limited (Toronto, Canada). 22 pep￾tides, 10–20-amino acids long, corresponding to the complete se￾quence of the core and pre-core region encoded polypeptides (sub￾type ayw), were purchased from Multiple Peptide System (San
Diego, CA) and Chiron Mimotopes (Clayton, Victoria, Australia).
Isolation of PBMC and T cell subsets. PBMC were isolated from
fresh heparinized blood by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifu￾gation. T cells and non-T cells were separated by rosetting PBMC
with 2-aminoethylisothiuronium bromide (AET; Sigma Chemical
Co., St. Louis, MO) treated sheep erythrocytes (19). The E-rosette–
forming T cells were separated from the non-rosetting (non-T) cells
by Ficoll-Hypaque gradient. The T cell–enriched population con￾tained . 95% CD31cells, whereas the non-rosetting fraction con￾tained , 3% of CD31cells.
CD41 and CD81 T cells were purified by immunomagnetic sep￾aration using Dynabeads (Dynal A.S., Oslo, Norway), according to
manufacturer’s instructions.
For negative and positive selection of CD45-RO cells, T cells
were first incubated with a mAb specific for CD45RO (0.1 mg/106
cells; Ancell Corporation, Bayport, MN), washed, and then incubated
with goat anti–mouse Ig conjugated magnetic beads (Dynal A.S.,
Oslo, Norway). After depletion, residual CD45RO cells ranged from
15 to 1.5% (mean 7%). Purity of positively selected CD45RO cells
was always around 95%. For depletion of activated T cells, a mixture
of anti–HLA-DR, CD69 and CD25-IL2 receptor mAbs (0.1 mg/106
cells; Immunotech, Marseille, France) was used. The percentage of
residual activated T cells after depletion ranged between 0 and 1.5%.
The purity of T cell preparations was tested with FITC or phycoer￾itrin (PE) conjugated mAbs (CD4/CD8, CD3/19, HLA-DR, IL2-rec;
Becton Dickinson Monoclonal Center, Inc. Mountain View, CA)
(CD45RO; Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) (CD69; Immuno￾tech, Marseille, France) on a FACSort flow cytometer (Becton Dick￾inson Immunocytometry Systems, Inc., Mountain View, CA).
Cell populations were resuspended at 1 3 106
 cells/ml in RPMI
1640 supplemented with 25 mM Hepes, 2 mM L-glutamine, 50 mg/ml
gentamycin, and 8% human serum (complete medium).
Production of antigen-specific polyclonal T cell lines. PBMC were
cultured in 24-well plates (2,5-3 3 106
 cells/1,5 ml) in complete me￾dium, in the presence of HBeAg or HBcAg (0.5 mg/ml). After 5 d, ac￾tivated T cells were expanded by adding recombinant IL-2 (30 U/ml;
Cetus Corporation, Emeryville, CA). On day 14, lines were tested for antigen
specificity and fine specificity with synthetic peptides and were restim￾ulated with antigen in the presence of irradiated (4,000 rads) autolo￾gous PBMC (5 3 105
/ml) in medium supplemented with IL-2. T cell
lines were then restimulated every 10–14 d and provided with IL-2 to
maintain the cell concentration between 3 3 105
 and 1 3 106
 (20).
Proliferation assays. Unfractionated PBMC (0.2 3 106
/well) were
incubated for 7 d at 378C in the presence of HBV nucleocapsid (0.5

mg/ml) or envelope (1 mg/ml) antigens, synthetic peptides (2.5 mg/ml)
or tetanus toxoid (0.5 mg/ml). In selected experiments, 0.1 3 106
 un￾fractionated T cells or T cell subsets were cultured with autologous ir￾radiated PBMC (0.1 3 106
) or non-T cells (2 3 104
) as antigen pre￾senting cells (APC) in the presence or absence of antigens. For the
study of polyclonal T cell lines, T cells were washed extensively to re￾move IL-2 and cultured (3 3 104
/well) for 3 d with autologous irradi￾ated PBMC as APC (0.1 3 106
/well) in the presence or absence of an￾tigens or peptides. All proliferation assays were performed in
triplicate in 96-well plates and [3H]thymidine (3H-TdR; 0.5 mCi /well;
specific activity, 2.0 Ci/mmol/L; Amersham International, Bucking￾hamshire, UK) was added 6 h before harvesting. Results are ex￾pressed as stimulation index (SI) which represents the ratio between
the mean cpm obtained in the presence and absence of antigen. SI
values above four were regarded as positive (at least two standard de￾viations above the mean of all SI values obtained with each individual
HBV protein or peptide in normal controls).
HLA-restriction of antigen recognition. Monoclonal antibodies rec￾ognizing monomorphic determinants of HLA DR (D1-12; IgG2a),
DQ1 (BT3/4; IgG1), DQ2 (XIII358/4; IgG2a), DQ3 (XIV466;
IgG2b), DP (B7/21; IgG2a) and a mAb specific for HLA A,B,C, anti￾gens (W6/32; IgG2a) were a gift from Dr. R.S. Accolla (University of
Genova, Genova, Italy) (20). Anti-HLA class II mAbs were used at a
final dilution of ascitic fluid 1:500; purified W6/32 was used at 1 mg/
ml. Autologous irradiated APC were incubated first with mAbs for 1 h
at 378C, then with synthetic peptides (0.5 mg/ml, 1 h, 378C) or with
HBV antigens (0.5 mg/ml, 4–6 h, 378C) and finally washed before ad￾dition to responder T cell lines.
Limiting dilution analysis. HBV nucleocapsid-specific T cell fre￾quency was determined by liming dilution analysis. Varying numbers
of purified T cells (1 3 105
, 6 3 104
, 3 3 104
, 1 3 104
, 3 3 103
, 1 3 103
,
3 3 102
, 1 3 102
) were cocultured in individual wells with a constant
number of irradiated autologous non-T cells (2 3 104
) in the presence
or absence of 0.5 mg/ml HBeAg. 32 replicate wells were seeded for
each concentration of responder T cells. 3H-TdR incorporation was
measured after 7 d. Individual cultures stimulated with antigen, show￾ing 3H-TdR incorporation higher than the arithmetic mean plus three
standard deviations of that shown by cultures incubated in the ab￾sence of antigen were scored as positive, and the fraction of nonre￾sponder cultures was calculated for each concentration of seeded T
cells. Poisson analysis was applied for the calculation of T cell fre￾quency (21) using the ELIDA computer program (22).
Lymphokine production and quantitation. T cells from antigen
specific lines were extensively washed and incubated at 1 3 106
/ml
with an equal number of autologous irradiated APC in the presence
of antigen or peptides. After 40–48 h, supernatants were collected
and stored in aliquots at 2708C until used. IFN-g and IL-4 were
quantitated by commercial ELISA assays (BioSource International,
Camarillo, CA and Quantikine R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, re￾spectively), as previously described (23). For the measurement of
IL5, the murine LyH7.B13 cell line was used as a source of indicator
cells (23). Values of cytokines 5 SD over those of control superna￾tants derived from irradiated APC alone were regarded as positive.
DNA preparation from serum. For the amplification of circulat￾ing HBV-DNA genomes, 100 ml of serum were incubated at 428C for
3 h with proteinase K (50 mg/tube) in 200 ml lysis buffer (10 mM Tris￾HCI, pH 8.0, 10 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.5% SDS) and
DNA was extracted by the phenol chloroform method, precipitated
with sodium acetate–ethanol, washed with 70% ethanol, and dis￾solved in 20 ml TE buffer.
DNA extraction from PBMC. PBMC were washed three times,
and the final cell wash was saved as a control for contamination of cells
with blood derived HBV-DNA. After digesting 10 3 106
 PBMC with
proteinase K in one ml lysis buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 9.0, 10 mM EDTA,
10 mM NaCl, 0.5% SDS) at 378C overnight, DNA was extracted by the
phenol-chloroform method, precipitated with sodium acetate–ethanol
and dissolved in 200 ml TE buffer. Approximately 1 mg of DNA de￾rived from each preparation was used for PCR amplification.
PCR protocol. 10 ml of serum DNA sample and 1 mg of PBMC
genomic DNA were amplified in a reaction buffer containing 10 mM
Tris-HCI, pH 8.3, 50 mM KCI, 1.5 mM MgCI2
 in a programmable
thermal cycler. A nested PCR was carried out using primers derived
from the core region of the HBV genome: for the first round of am￾plification 40 cycles were performed at 948C for 45 s, 558C for 45 s,
and 728C for 45 s with the external antisense primer core 4B 59GTA
ACA TTG AGA TTC CCG A39 and the external sense primer core 0
59 CTG GGA GGA GTT GGG GGA39. For the second round the
same conditions were adopted using primer sense core 1 59ACT
AGG AGC CTG TAG GCA TAA ATT GGT CT39 and primer anti￾sense core 2 59GCA GTA TGG TGA GGT GAA CA39. The ex￾pected size of the product from the second amplification was 289-bp
long. PCR products were visualized by ethidium bromide staining on
2% agarose gels. Our nested PCR method allowed to detect consis￾tently between 10 and 100 copies of HBV-DNA per sample, as assayed
using serial dilutions of the pFC80 plasmid, containing four copies of
HBV-DNA cloned into a pBR322 vector (sensitivity limit 5 ng 3
1028
).
Results
PBMC responses to HBV antigens and tetanus toxoid. The pro￾liferative T cell response to HBV nucleocapsid antigens and
peptides observed during the acute phase of HBV infection in
a group of 17 patients was compared to the response expressed
by the same individuals several years (mean 5.362.2 yr; range
2.2–13 yr; Table I) after resolution of hepatitis (recovery
phase). In the acute phase of disease all tested patients (patient
13 was not tested in the acute phase) showed significant T cell
proliferation to HBV nucleocapsid proteins and 14 out of 17
(82%) were still able to express significant responses several
years later. 11 patients were tested more than once a few
months apart during the recovery phase and 4 of them
switched their T cell response from negative to positive, sug￾gesting that the frequency of circulating antigen-specific T cells
can fluctuate over time. For example, patient 1 was tested five
times and his T cell response to the HBV nucleoprotein was
negative in 2 instances; patients 6 and 8 were tested four times
and in both the response was positive in three separate experi￾ments; patient five was tested twice and showed one positive
and one negative response. Therefore, persistence of HBV￾specific memory T cells in the three non-responsive patients
(patients 15, 16, and 17; Table I) cannot be totally excluded be￾cause their responsiveness to HBV antigens was tested only
once.
To assess whether maintenance of T cell responses in the
recovery phase was associated with viral persistence, HBV￾DNA was tested by nested PCR in serum and PBMC. At least
two PCR assays were performed in each patient. In seven sub￾jects two different DNA extractions of two different time
points were analyzed, for a total of four PCR determinations.
HBV-DNA was detected at least once in the serum of 9 out of
the 17 subjects (Table I), while PBMC were PCR negative, in￾dicating either absence of HBV-DNA or the presence of less
than 10 copies of HBV-DNA per haploid genome. All these
results suggest a very low level of HBV viremia in these pa￾tients, near the sensitivity limit of our method.
The behavior of the T cell response to HBV envelope anti￾gens was apparently similar to that against HBV nucleocapsid
antigens because the percentage of significant proliferative re￾sponses after recovery (20%) was equivalent to that detected
in the acute phase of hepatitis (24%). Whether this finding is

1188 Penna et al.
biologically relevant remains however unclear because the
proliferative responses to HBV envelope antigens were only
slightly above background, irrespective of the stage of infec￾tion (Table II and data not shown). For this reason, further
phenotypic and functional characterization was focused on
“memory” responses to HBV nucleocapsid proteins.
T cell responses to HBV antigens after recovery were com￾pared to T cell responses against tetanus toxoid and HBV en￾velope antigens in 15 anti-HBV and 17 anti-tetanus vaccine re￾cipients immunized an average of 5.7 and 8.8 yr earlier,
respectively. Significant levels of T cell responses were detect￾able in 47% of anti-HBV and 76% of anti-tetanus toxoid vac￾cine recipients (Table II). Responses to HBV envelope anti￾gen by vaccine recipients were significantly stronger (P , 0.03
by Student’s t test) than those detected in naturally immunized
subjects recovered from hepatitis.
Hierarchy of HBV nucleocapsid epitopes recognized by T cells
during acute infection and after clinical recovery. In general, pep￾tides able to recall significant responses in the acute phase of in￾fection were still recognized by PBMC isolated several years
later (Fig. 1). In addition, an amplification of peripheral blood T
cell responses was observed during the recovery phase of hepati￾tis. In fact, when responses to the peptides used at both time
points were compared, a statistically significant difference was
observed (P 5 0.0001 by Student’s t-test for paired values) be￾tween the number of peptides able to induce T cell proliferation
in the acute versus the recovery phase of disease.
To compare the hierarchy of immunodominance of the dif￾ferent epitopes identified by direct PBMC stimulation with
synthetic peptides at different stages of infection, polyclonal T
cell lines were produced from PBMC derived from acute infec￾tion and from the recovery phase by stimulation with HBV nu￾cleocapsid antigen in the presence of IL2. The capacity of the
polyclonal T cell lines to recognize the same peptides that were
stimulatory for parental PBMC was tested. As illustrated in
Fig. 2, T cell lines derived from the same patient at different
time points showed similar patterns of fine specificity, indicat￾ing that the hierarchy of nucleocapsid epitopes generated by
the intracellular processing of the whole protein was main￾tained unchanged throughout the years.
HLA restriction of responder T cells. HBV nucleocapsid-spe￾cific T cell responses were in general HLA class II restricted, be￾cause in most experiments proliferation of T cell lines induced by
HBV nucleoprotein stimulation was inhibited by anti-HLA class
II, but not anti-class I mAbs (Fig. 3). Proliferative responses were
generally inhibited by more than one anti-HLA class II mAb
(Fig. 3, top) as a result of the multispecificity of the T cell lines
which were able to recognize multiple epitopes in association
with different HLA molecules. For example, the region spanning
residues 1–27 contains at least 2 distinct HLA class II restricted
epitopes that can be recognized in association with DR, DQ and
DP molecules, as shown by anti-HLA antibody inhibition of the
peptide-induced proliferative response of polyclonal T cell lines
produced by stimulation with HBV nucleocapsid antigens
(Fig. 3, bottom). Interestingly, the nucleocapsid sequence 18–27
that was previously shown to be an important HLA-A0201–
restricted CTL epitope, can also be recognized in association
with HLA DP molecules (subject 6; Fig. 3, bottom).

Inhibition by anti-HLA class I antibodies was sporadic and
partial (Fig. 3, top) suggesting the presence of a minor popula￾tion of HLA class I restricted T–cells proliferating in response
to exogenous antigen.
Phenotypic features of HBV nucleocapsid-specific memory
T cells. In line with HLA restriction results, synthetic peptides
were recognized by CD41 and CD81T cells purified from
PBMC, but most of them preferentially induced proliferation
of CD41T cells (Fig. 4). Also a CD8 proliferative response
was stimulated by recombinant HBV nucleocapsid antigens
(subjects 4 and 6; Fig. 4). Since the absolute number of con￾taminant CD4 cells within the purified CD8 cells seeded in
each well was 0.8 for patient four and 0.05 for patient six (cal￾culation based on the frequency of specific T cells that was
1:3,600 in patient four and 1:2,000 in patient six; see below), it
is unlikely that the proliferative response by the purified
CD81 cells was due to residual CD41T cells.
Depletion experiments were carried out to assess whether
T cells responsive to HBV nucleocapsid belonged to the
CD45-RO1 subset and whether proliferative reponses were
sustained by activated or resting T cells.
In all patients tested, T cell responses to HBV nucleocapsid
were sustained by CD45-RO1 cells since proliferation was ab￾rogated by depletion of CD45-RO1 cells but it was detectable

subjects, results were compared with those observed in a group
of randomly selected patients with chronic HBV infection (Fig. 8
A) and in other patients with self-limited hepatitis B during the
acute phase of disease (Fig. 8 B). While most chronic patients
had T cell frequencies close to the sensitivity threshold of the
method (mean T cell frequency, 1:329,000), as a reflection of the
fact that most of them are hyporesponsive at the T cell level to
HBV nucleocapsid antigens (15), most recovered subjects
showed T cell frequencies (mean T cell frequency, 1:35,757) sim￾ilar to those detectable during the acute phase of infection, as il￾lustrated in figure 8 B by two representative patients followed se￾quentially during the course of acute hepatitis B.
No correlation was found in recovered subjects between
frequency of HBV circulating nucleocapsid-specific T cells and
detection of HBV viremia or time elapsed from clinical recovery.
Discussion
HBV can cause either acute self-limited or chronic infections
with possible integration of viral DNA into the host’s genome.
Chronic persistence of HBV is generally associated with weak
HLA class I and class II restricted T cell responses to struc￾tural and non structural HBV antigens (14, 24–27). These re￾sponses are frequently undetectable in the peripheral blood,
despite antigen persistence. The molecular basis of this hypo￾responsiveness is still largely undefined. In contrast, resolution of
acute hepatitis is associated with the production of neutralizing
anti-envelope antibodies and the development of anti-viral T
cell responses (14, 24–27).

T cell lines were produced from each patient by HBV nucleo￾capsid antigen stimulation of PBMC derived from the acute (black bars) or the recovery phase (gray bars) of infection at the same time points il￾lustrated in Fig. 1.

in CD45-RO1-enriched populations (Fig. 5). Identical results
were obtained in control experiments carried out in two recov￾ered subjects who were sensitized to tetanus toxoid (Fig. 5).
The role of T cells expressing surface activation markers
(HLA-DR, CD69, and CD25) in the recognition of nucleocapsid
antigens was then investigated. In four out of eight experiments
(S3, S4, and S8; Fig. 6 A), depletion of activated T cells abrogated
the HBV nucleocapsid specific T cell response and in one case
(S9; Fig. 6 A) a partial decrease was observed. Only in two exper￾iments performed in vaccinated subjects a partial inhibition of
HBV envelope (C2; Fig. 6 B) or tetanus toxoid (C1; Fig. 6 B) rec￾ognition was observed upon depletion of activated T cells.
Cytokine secretion by HBV nucleocapsid-specific T cells dur￾ing acute infection and following clinical recovery. A total of 34
HBV nucleocapsid-specific polyclonal T cell lines produced by
antigen stimulation of PBMC from the acute (15 T cell lines
from 9 patients) or recovery (19 T cell lines from 6 patients)
phase were tested for their production of IFN-g, IL4, and IL5
upon antigen or peptide stimulation. 67% of the T cell lines
generated during the acute phase showed a Th1 and 33% a
Th0 cytokine profile. In contrast, T cell lines generated during
the recovery phase showed an opposite profile with a preva￾lence of Th0- (74%) over Th1-type lines (21%) (Fig. 7).

T cells. The frequency of circulating HBV nucleocapsid-specific
T lymphocytes was evaluated in 10 of the 14 recovered subjects
whose T cells were responsive to HBV nucleoprotein (Fig. 8 A).

the acute phase of infection was not available in this group of

T Cell Memory to Hepatitis Virus 1191
The concept that disease resolution corresponds to eradica￾tion of infection has recently been challenged by the observa￾tion that trace amounts of virus detectable by PCR can persist
in serum and PBMC of at least some patients long after clinical
recovery (13, 14). This is consistent with the hypothesis that in￾tegration or infection of immunologically privileged sites may
allow the virus to escape complete elimination even in the
presence of an immune response able to terminate disease. Ex￾tensive but incomplete viral clearance may save a source of an￾tigen able to boost periodically specific responses, thus main￾taining the pool of anti-viral T cells, perhaps for the lifetime.
Apparently at variance with this prediction, CD4-mediated
responses to HBV nucleocapsid antigens (the most powerful
immunogens for HLA class II–restricted T cells in the acute
phase of infection) have been observed to decrease and wane
in some acutely infected patients concurrent with, or shortly
after, recovery (20, 24). This may reflect removal of effector
cells that have become redundant and superfluous at the end
of a successful immune response (3, 28).
To investigate the behavior of HBV-specific T cell re￾sponses long after resolution of acute hepatitis B and possible
correlations with persistence of trace amounts of virus as a po￾Figure 4. Proliferative response to HBV nucleocapsid antigen and

tential stimulus for maintenance of T cell memory, we ana￾lyzed in parallel viremia by PCR and T cell responses to HBV
antigens during the acute phase of hepatitis B and several
years following resolution of disease. Our study shows that the
majority (82%) of the patients spontaneously recovered from
acute hepatitis B were still able to mount vigorous T cell prolif￾eration to HBV nucleocapsid antigens several years later. Al￾though proliferative responses were generally sustained by
HLA class II–restricted CD41 T–cells, CD8-mediated, HLA
class I–restricted responses were also observed. The relevance
of this finding is supported by the analysis of the anti-viral cy￾tolytic function of CD81 T cells reported elsewhere (Reher￾mann, B., C. Ferrari, and F.V. Chisari, manuscript submitted
for publication), showing that also HLA class I–restricted re￾sponses to the viral envelope, nucleocapsid and polymerase
antigens can last for decades following resolution of acute
HBV infection. In contrast, significant T cell responses to
HBV envelope antigens were detectable only in a minority of
recovered subjects and their levels were always low. This is not

IL-4 and/or IL-5, but not IFN-g, were defined as Th2; T cell lines able 
to produce IFN-g plus IL-4 and/or IL-5 were defined as Th0.

surprising because these responses are very weak or undetect￾able even in the acute phase of infection, when high titers of
neutralizing anti-envelope antibodies are produced (24).
HBV-DNA was detected in 64% of the subjects with long￾lasting T cell responses but in none of the three non-responder
subjects (Table I), suggesting an association between virus per￾sistence and long-term maintenance of T cell “memory” to
HBV nucleoprotein. Viremia, however, was not repeatedly de￾tectable in all determinations, consistent with the presence of
very minute amounts of circulating virus, close to the threshold
sensitivity of the PCR method, but probably still able to pro￾vide periodic stimulation to HBV-specific T cells.
No difference between long-term responders and non￾responders to HBV antigens at the T cell level was observed
with respect to the time elapsed between clinical recovery and
analysis of T cell responses in vitro.
Significant T cell responses were induced not only by re￾combinant proteins but also by synthetic peptides. The same
antigenic sequences were identified by both direct PBMC
stimulation with synthetic peptides and fine specificity analysis
of polyclonal T cell lines induced by whole HBV nucleocapsid
antigens. Moreover, the same hierarchy of dominant and sub￾dominant responses detected in the acute phase of infection
was maintained after recovery. All these results, together with
the lack of significant T cell responses to recombinant HBV
proteins in control subjects, make very unlikely the possibility
that our findings are due to a primary T cell induction in vitro.
This is further supported by the observation that prolifera￾tive responses to HBV nucleocapsid antigens were sustained
by T cell subsets expressing the low molecular weight isoform
of the CD45 molecule (CD45-RO), a marker for the majority
of memory T cells (1, 29, 30). CD45-RO is acquired rapidly
upon T cell activation (1) and CD45-RO1T cells respond
more vigorously to recall antigens and provide more effective
help to B cells than their naive CD45-RA1 precursors (1).
Also the cytokine pattern of CD45-RO1 cells seems to differ
from that of CD45-RA1 cells, the former secreting multiple
cytokines and thus exhibiting a Th0-like phenotype, the latter
producing mainly IL2 (1, 31). Interestingly, long-lasting re￾sponses to HBV nucleocapsid antigens were dominated by Th0
cells able to produce IFN-g, IL4 and IL5, whereas effector T
cells derived from the acute stage of infection were mostly Th1.
It is still unclear whether the difference in the cytokine profile
of responsive T cells in the acute or recovery phase may result
from changes of the microenvironment (e.g., cytokines and co￾stimuli) where viral antigens are presented to specific T–cells.
In most of our patients maintenance of T cell responses seems
to reflect recent activation in vivo because proliferation could be
abrogated by depletion of DR/CD69/IL2-R positive (i.e., acti￾vated) T cells. This may suggest that T–cell memory to HBV does
not reside in individual cells with a long lifespan but rather in
their clonal progeny maintained by periodic restimulation with
antigen. Indeed, the effect of activated T cell depletion may be
consistent with the hypothesis of a recent exposure to antigen,
but cannot distinguish whether antigen is newly synthesized or
stored in the past by follicular dendritic cells (1, 2, 32, 33).
Antigen store by dendritic cells is however expected to
gradually run out and memory T cell responses to eventually
wane (1) if the host is not periodically re-exposed to antigen,
given the estimated T cell life span of z 2 yr (34).
While reinfection with HBV seems to be a quite unlikely
mechanism to boost T cell responses in those patients who do
not belong to groups at risk, detection of HBV-DNA in a pro￾portion of our patients suggests that chronic subclinical infec￾tions persisting after resolution of acute disease may represent
a source of antigen. HBV could survive despite a vigorous
anti-viral response either through infection of immunologically
privileged sites or through latency (as non-replicating episomal
forms of viral DNA) in liver cells or PBMC (35, 36). In alter￾native, a source of viral antigens may be represented by viral
sequences integrated in the host genome (37). Transmission of
HBV infection after transplantation of livers and kidneys de￾rived from HBsAg and HBV-DNA negative but anti-HBV an￾tibody positive donors (38–40) supports these possibilities.
In this scenario, viral replication may be suppressed by the
immune response until the frequency of antigen-specific T
cells falls below a critical threshold. This may create conditions
allowing the virus to reactivate, to synthesize antigen and to
eventually boost memory responses, that in turn would neu￾tralize the virus and suppress again its replication. Consistent
with this possibility are the variations of virus-specific T cell
frequencies observed in recovered patients, as well as their
fluctuations in individual subjects. Also consistent is the obser￾vation that T cell responses were sustained by activated cells in
most but not in all experiments. This may reflect the different
lapse of time between last encounter with antigen and testing
of the T cell response in vitro. If this interpretation is correct,
responses to HBV antigens measured in recovered subjects
should be more properly defined as “ongoing effector” rather
than “memory” T cell responses.
An alternative source of stimuli able to reactivate memory
T cell responses may reside in cross-reactive recognition of ei￾ther self or environmental antigens (41–43) as well as in cyto￾kines secreted after exposure to unrelated antigens (44). These
mechanisms may be particularly important for long-lasting re￾sponses to tetanus toxoid that are not maintained by persis￾tence of the pathogen but are detectable in vaccine recipients
with a frequency and a duration similar to those of the re￾sponses to HBV nucleocapsid antigens in hepatitis B recov￾ered subjects.
If the degree of cross-reactive specificity for environmental
antigens can influence the strength and duration of T cell mem￾ory to a given antigen (42), it is tempting to speculate that also
the different vigor of memory responses to HBV nucleocapsid
and envelope antigens may be influenced by different levels of
cross-reactivity with the environment. The situation in vivo
must be however much more complicated, as suggested by the
intriguing observation that memory T cell responses to HBV
envelope antigens are more easily detectable and the frequency
of memory T cells is significantly higher (data not shown) in the
peripheral blood of HBsAg vaccine recipients than in the blood
of subjects recovered from acute hepatitis B. The molecular
and cellular basis of this difference remains undefined.
Though all of the foregoing mechanisms could maintain
long-term T cell memory to HBV nucleocapsid antigens fol￾lowing self-limited hepatitis B, we favor the hypothesis that
long-lasting responses are maintained by viral antigen encoded
by HBV gene sequences persisting within the host even after
complete clinical resolution. The observations that (i) T cell
responses can be sustained by recently activated T cells circu￾lating at high frequency in the blood of recovered patients, (b)
long-lasting T cell responses are mediated not only by HLA
class II but also by HLA class I restricted T cells, (c) half of the
recovered subjects are serum HBV-DNA positive by PCR and

1194 Penna et al.
(d) hepatitis can recur upon immunosuppression of anti-HBV
antibody positive subjects (38, 39, 45–47), may be all consistent
with our hypothesis that long-lasting T cell immunity to HBV
antigens does not simply reflect long-term T cell memory but
rather active effector T cell responses continuously restimu￾lated by their interplay with the virus.
