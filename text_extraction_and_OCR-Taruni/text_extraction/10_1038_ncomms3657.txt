Although it has long been known that patients with sepsis often have thrombocytopenia
and that septic patients with severe thrombocytopenia have a poor prognosis and higher
mortality, the role of platelets in the pathogenesis of sepsis is poorly understood. Here we
report a protective role of platelets in septic shock. We show that experimental thrombo￾cytopenia induced by intraperitoneal injection of an anti-glycoprotein Iba monoclonal anti￾body increases mortality and aggravates organ failure, whereas transfusion of platelets
reduces mortality in lipopolysaccharide-induced endotoxemia and a bacterial infusion mouse
sepsis model. Plasma concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines TNF-a and IL-6 are ele￾vated by thrombocytopenia and decreased by platelet transfusion in septic mice. Further￾more, we identify that platelets protect from septic shock by inhibiting macrophage￾dependent inflammation via the COX1/PGE2/EP4-dependent pathway. Thus, these findings
demonstrate a previously unappreciated role for platelets in septic shock and suggest that
platelet transfusion may be effective in treating severely septic patients.

Platelets have a central role in physiological haemostasis by
preventing excess bleeding, but are also involved in
pathologic arterial thrombosis. Emerging evidence suggests
that platelets are also critical components of the immune
system1,2. Platelets are activated in patients with systemic
inflammation and sepsis, resulting in their sequestration within
microcirculation and thrombocytopenia3,4. Severe thrombo￾cytopenia in septic patients is associated with adverse outcome
and high mortality5–7. Platelets regulate inflammation and
sepsis through multiple mechanisms. Platelets express a lipo￾polysaccharide (LPS) receptor, Toll-like receptor-4, which contri￾butes to thrombocytopenia through a neutrophil-dependent
pulmonary sequestration in response to LPS8–10. Platelets
also interact with other leukocytes, including monocytes11,12.
Interaction of activated platelets with monocytes induces nuclear
translocation of nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) and expression of
NF-kB-dependent inflammatory genes13–15. In addition to direct
interactions with leukocytes, platelets contribute to inflammation
and immune progression by releasing cytokines and mediators
stored in alpha and dense granules upon stimulation16,17.
In the present study, we used LPS-induced endotoxemia model
and a bacterial infusion sepsis model through intraperitoneal
(i.p.) injection of LPS or an Escherichia coli strain ATCC 25922,
respectively, into mice to investigate the effects of experimental
thrombocytopenia and platelet transfusion on septic shock. LPS
or endotoxin, a component of the outer membrane of Gram￾negative bacteria, has an essential role in the pathogenesis of
sepsis. LPS administration into mice has become a standard
inflammation model and is widely used in sepsis research18.
Human sepsis is often caused by a single pathogen. The bacterial
infusion model introduces a single pathogen into mice in a
controlled manner, allowing reproducible infection, which has
also been translated to larger animals for the study of systemic
and organ-specific haemodynamics. We demonstrate that
experimental thrombocytopenia increases mortality and
aggravates organ failure, whereas transfusion of platelets
reduces mortality in LPS-induced endotoxemia and E. coli
ATCC 25922-induced sepsis. Our data reveal an important new
role for platelets in sepsis and define a mechanism by which
platelets protect from septic shock.
Results
Thrombocytopenia exacerbates septic shock and organ failure.
To establish a role of platelets in sepsis-associated inflammation,
we induced thrombocytopenia in mice by i.p. injection of a rat
antimouse GPIba monoclonal antibody. Four hours after injec￾tion of the antibody, platelet counts were decreased by 90%
(Fig. 1a). Platelet counts were not altered by injection of an iso￾type-matched rat IgG control. We then compared survival rates
between the IgG-treated and thrombocytopenic mice after LPS
challenge. Unexpectedly, thrombocytopenic mice had a sig￾nificantly greater mortality rate than the mice administered with
control IgG (Fig. 1b). All thrombocytopenic mice died within 36 h
after LPS challenge. In contrast, none of the mice treated with
control IgG died within 36 h after challenge by LPS. Lethality in
sepsis is associated with organ failure. Thus, we examined the
effects of thrombocytopenia on liver function in mice challenged
with LPS. Plasma concentrations of liver enzymes, alanine ami￾notransferase and aspartate aminotransferase that are released
into the circulation on injury and death of liver cells, respectively,
were significantly higher in plasma from antimouse GPIba
monoclonal antibody-treated mice than those that received con￾trol IgG (Fig. 1c,d). Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is an enzyme
found in many tissues, including the liver and heart, and may be
released into plasma with hepatic and myocardial damage.
Accordingly, plasma LDH concentration was higher in the
thrombocytopenic mice than that of control mice (Fig. 1e).
Creatine kinase (CK), an enzyme expressed by various tissues and
cell types, can be elevated in plasma as a consequence of muscle
injury or renal failure due to reduced clearance. Plasma CK
concentrations were much higher in thrombocytopenic mice than
in IgG-treated mice (Fig. 1f). Together, these results demonstrate
that thrombocytopenia exacerbates tissue injury associated with
sepsis.
Thrombocytopenia does not cause inflammatory haemorrhage.
Previous studies reported that inflammation caused life-threa￾tening haemorrhage during thrombocytopenia19,20. In those
studies, the anti-GPIba monoclonal antibody was injected
intravenously or retro-orbitally, which resulted in a lowering of
platelet count to o2.5% of that of control mice. However, no
detectable haemorrhage occurred in the lungs (Fig. 1g,h) from
mice in which thrombocytopenia was induced by i.p. injection of
the anti-GPIba antibody. In addition, red blood cell counts and
haemoglobin concentrations were not significantly different
between IgG-treated mice and the anti-GPIba antibody-treated
mice after LPS injection. Thus, inflammatory haemorrhage did
not appear to account for the higher mortality rates with LPS
in mice rendered thrombocytopenic by i.p. injection of the
anti-GPIba antibody.
Thrombocytopenia aggravates inflammatory response to LPS.
Endotoxemia increases production of endogenous cytokines,
including tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) and interleukin (IL)-
6, which have important roles in the development of disseminated
intravascular coagulation, acute respiratory distress syndrome
and septic shock21–24. Therefore, we investigated whether
platelets protect from endotoxemia by altering expression of
these cytokines. Indeed, LPS elevated plasma levels of TNF-a and
IL-6, and the effect was amplified in thrombocytopenic mice
(Fig. 2a,b). These results suggest that platelets normally inhibit
endotoxemia-induced cytokine production. Macrophages are a
major source of TNF-a in vivo22,25,26. Therefore, we hypothesize
that platelets protect from septic shock by attenuating
macrophage-dependent inflammatory response, thereby
decreasing concentrations of these proinflammatory cytokines
in plasma. We further hypothesize that platelet depletion
increases TNF-a and IL-6 production by reducing a
macrophage inhibitor factor(s). If these hypotheses are correct,
then thrombocytopenia should have no effect on LPS-induced
increases in plasma TNF-a and IL-6 levels in the mice lacking
macrophages. Macrophages were depleted by retro-orbital
injection of liposomal clodronate. Macrophage depletion was
confirmed by detecting peripheral monocyte concentration by
flow cytometry with an Alexa Fluor 488-labelled anti-CD115
monoclonal antibody. Monocyte concentration was reduced
by495% (Fig. 2c,d). As expected, plasma TNF-a concentra￾tions were significantly decreased in macrophage-depleted mice
challenged with LPS compared with the mice injected with con￾trol liposomes (Fig. 2e). The increase in plasma TNF-a observed
in thrombocytopenic mice was absent when macrophages were
predepleted.
Macrophages do not appear to be a major source of IL-6
production early after LPS challenge, because depletion of
macrophages did not alter plasma IL-6 concentrations until
more than 4 h after injection of LPS (Fig. 2f). At 8 h after injection
of LPS, depletion of macrophages decreased plasma IL-6
concentrations, suggesting that macrophages contribute to
plasma IL-6 production at later stages of endotoxemia. Throm￾bocytopenia increased plasma IL-6 concentrations in control

mice administrated liposomes but had no effect in mice
predepleted with macrophages (Fig. 2f). These results demon￾strate that platelets inhibit macrophage-derived IL-6 but have no
effect on IL-6 production derived from other cells.
Thrombocytopenia exacerbates bacterial sepsis. We further
investigated the role of platelets in septic shock using a bacterial
infusion sepsis model. C57BL/6J mice were injected with the anti￾GPIba monoclonal antibody to deplete platelets. Four hours after
injection of the antibody, the mice received i.p. 0.2 ml saline
containing 2  107 colony-forming unit of E. coli ATCC 25922
per mouse. Thrombocytopenic mice had dramatically higher
plasma levels of TNF-a and IL-6 (Fig. 3a,b), and a greater
mortality rate compared with the mice administered control IgG
(Fig. 3c).
Platelet transfusion protects against septic shock. As platelets
inhibited macrophage-derived TNF-a and IL-6 production,
platelet transfusion may reduce in vivo inflammatory response
during sepsis, thereby protecting from septic shock. C57BL/6J
mice were injected retro-orbitally with washed platelets from the
same background (1  109 per mouse) immediately after injection

of LPS (i.p). Injection of 1  109 platelet per mouse increased
platelet counts by B25% (Fig. 4a). Plasma TNF-a and IL-6
concentrations following LPS were significantly lower in mice
injected with platelets versus saline (Fig. 4b,c). Platelet transfusion
also attenuated thrombocytopenia during endotoxemia (Fig. 4a).
Platelet transfusion increased the survival rate from 16.0% to
41.7% (Fig. 4d) and 6.7% to 40.0% (Fig. 4e), respectively, in LPS￾induced endotoxemia model and bacterial infusion sepsis model.
Protection against sepsis by platelets depends on macrophages.
To determine whether the protective effect of platelet transfusion
on sepsis depends on inhibition of macrophage function, mac￾rophages were depleted by retro-orbital injection of liposomal
clodronate. As injection of control liposome increased mortality
rate in the LPS-challenged mice, a lower dose of LPS was applied.
Depletion of macrophage increased survival rate from 8.33% to
50.0% in response to LPS challenge (Fig. 4f). Transfusion of
platelets did not significantly increase the survival rate in the
macrophage-depleted mice. These results suggest that the pro￾tective effect of platelet transfusion on endotoxemia depends on
macrophages.
Platelets inhibit macrophage-derived TNF-a and IL-6. Next,
in-vitro experiments were performed to address whether platelets
directly inhibit macrophage-derived cytokines in response to
LPS. Mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were
stimulated with LPS in the presence or absence of washed mouse
platelets. Although addition of platelets increased TNF-a pro￾duction from macrophages in response to a low-dose LPS
(Fig. 5a), TNF-a production elicited by higher concentrations of
LPS was dramatically reduced by addition of platelets (Fig. 5a).
Similarly, IL-6 production induced by LPS was reduced by

addition of platelets (Fig. 5a). As LPS at 100 ng ml  1 induced
maximal TNF-a and IL-6 production from macrophages, this
concentration of LPS was chosen to investigate the mechanism
whereby platelets inhibit macrophage-derived TNF-a in the
following experiments.
Platelets express the LPS receptor, Toll-like receptor-4. To
exclude the possibility that inhibition of LPS-induced TNF-a
production is due to platelet sequestration of LPS, platelets were
incubated with H3-labelled LPS for 2 h and the amount of
radioactivity associated with platelets was measured. Despite the
presence of LPS receptor on platelets, radioactivity remained in
the supernatant rather than with platelets (Fig. 5b).
Platelet releasates inhibit TNF-a and IL-6 production. To
determine whether platelets inhibit macrophage-derived cyto￾kines through direct interaction between platelets and macro￾phages or by releasing inhibitory factors, platelets were incubated
with LPS for 30 min and then centrifuged. The resulting super￾natant containing LPS was added to macrophages. LPS in
the presence of platelet releasate elicited less TNF-a and IL-6
production than did LPS alone (Fig. 5c).
The coagulation system is activated during sepsis, resulting
in thrombin generation27,28, a physiological platelet agonist.
Therefore, during sepsis, platelets are activated not only by LPS
but also by physiological agonists such as thrombin. To determine
whether platelet activation induced by a physiological agonist has
an effect on macrophages, platelets from C57BL/6 mice were
stimulated with thrombin and stirred in an aggregometer at 37 C
for 5 min. Supernatant from the thrombin-stimulated platelets
markedly inhibited LPS-induced TNF-a and IL-6 production by
macrophages (Fig. 5c). Thrombin-induced platelet activation and
secretion requires Gq signalling29. As expected, supernatant of
thrombin-stimulated wild-type platelets, but not Gq-deficient
platelets, inhibited LPS-induced TNF-a production (Fig. 5d).
Taken together, these results demonstrate an inhibitory role
of platelet activation in LPS-induced TNF-a production by
macrophages.
We next examined the effects of platelet releasate on TNF-a
production from macrophages induced by serum amyloid A to
determine whether platelet activation has a common role in the
regulation of macrophage response to inflammatory challenge.
Addition of supernatant of thrombin-stimulated platelets reduced
serum amyloid A-stimulated TNF-a production by macrophages
(Fig. 5e).
The effect of platelet secretion on TNF-a production. Platelets
contain two major types of granules: a-granules containing
soluble and membrane-associated proteins and dense granules
containing small molecules such as nucleotides30. In response
to agonist activation, including LPS, platelets secrete granule
contents31–33. We therefore investigated whether granule
releasate contributes to the inhibitory effects of platelets on
macrophages. Most components secreted from a-granules are
proteins16 that are sensitive to heating or proteinase K treatment.
However, neither heating (Supplementary Fig. S1a) nor protei￾nase K (Supplementary Fig. S1b) treatment blunted the inhibitor
effects of activated platelet supernatant on TNF-a production by
macrophages.
ADP secreted from dense granules has an essential role in
platelet activation through its receptor P2Y12 and P2Y1 (ref. 34).
The addition of the ADP scavenger apyrase did not block the
inhibitory effect of platelet releasate on LPS-induced TNF-a
production by macrophages (Supplementary Fig. S2a). Further￾more, platelet releasate inhibited LPS-induced TNF-a from
macrophages lacking the ADP receptor P2Y12 (Supplementary
Fig. S2b), indicating that ADP is not required for the inhibition of
macrophages by platelets. Munc13-4 is critical for cargo release
from both a- and dense granules of platelets35. Platelet releasates
from Unc13dJinx mice that lack Munc13-4 inhibited LPS-induced
TNF-a by macrophages (Supplementary Fig. S2c). Taken
together, these results suggest that inhibition of macrophage￾derived TNF-a by platelets is independent of granule cargo
release from platelets.
Platelets inhibit TNF-a through the COX1-dependent pathway.
Synthesis of TXA2 from cyclooxygenase 1 (COX1) signalling is an
important positive feedback mechanism for platelet activation. To
determine whether COX1 is involved in platelet inhibition of
macrophages, we examined whether aspirin, a COX1 inhibitor,
could reverse the inhibitory effect of platelets on macrophages.
Pretreatment of platelets with aspirin markedly reversed inhibi￾tion of LPS-induced TNF-a production from macrophages by
platelet releasates (Fig. 6a). Accordingly, supernatant from
thrombin-activated COX1-deficient platelets had less effect than
that of wild-type platelets on inhibiting macrophage-derived
TNF-a (Fig. 6b). Considering the importance of TXA2 in reg￾ulating platelet activation, we asked whether TXA2 synthesized
from COX1 signalling is responsible for platelet inhibition on
macrophages. Addition of a stable TXA2 analogue, U46619, failed
to inhibit LPS-induced TNF-a production by macrophages
(Supplementary Fig. S3a). Supernatant from thrombin-stimulated
wild-type platelets inhibited LPS-induced TNF-a production by

macrophages lacking the TXA2 receptor, TP (Supplementary
Fig. S3b). Thus, platelet inhibition of macrophage function is
likely to be independent of TXA2.
COX1 activation results in the production of many types of
prostaglandins. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) modulates macrophage
function and decreases TNF-a and IL-6 production via its
receptors EP1–4 (refs 36,37). LPS and thrombin stimulated PGE2
production in platelets (Fig. 6c), and PGE2 or heated PGE2
inhibited LPS-induced TNF-a production in macrophages
(Supplementary Fig. S3c). To determine whether PGE2 is
required for platelet inhibition of LPS-induced TNF-a production
by macrophages, macrophages were pre-incubated with antago￾nists of EP1–4. EP4 antagonist, GW62, but not the antagonists for
EP1-3, reversed the inhibitory effect of platelet releasates on LPS￾induced TNF-a production from macrophages (Fig. 6d), indicat￾ing that platelet inhibition of macrophage function involves the
PGE2/EP4 pathway.
In agreement with the in-vitro observations, plasma TNF-a
and IL-6 levels were higher in LPS-treated C57BL/6 mice injected
with COX1-deficient platelets than with platelets from wild-type
littermates (Fig. 7a,b). Injection of COX1-deficient platelets failed
to protect from LPS-induced septic shock (Fig. 7c). Next, we
investigated the role of aspirin on sepsis. We first determined the
effective dose of aspirin in inhibiting platelet COX1 activity
in vivo. Thrombin-induced TXA2 production was completely
abolished in the platelets isolated from mice administrated with

10 or 25 mg kg  1 of aspirin (Fig. 7d). Aspirin (25 mg kg  1)
pretreated mice had significantly higher plasma TNF-a and IL-6
concentrations than control mice (Fig. 7e,f). Aspirin pretreatment
also reduced survival rate in the LPS-induced sepsis model
(Fig. 7g). Taken together, these results demonstrate that platelet
inhibition of inflammatory responses and LPS-induced TNF-a
production from macrophages is dependent on platelet COX1
activity.
Discussion
Growing evidence indicates that platelets are key effectors in
many inflammatory diseases. In sepsis, thrombocytopenia is a
frequent complication and closely associates with increased
mortality6,7. Whether thrombocytopenia is a marker for more
disseminated disease or a contributor to poor outcomes is not
known. In the present study, we demonstrate that antibody￾induced thrombocytopenia in mice increases mortality in a

LPS-induced endotoxemia and in a bacterial infusion sepsis
model. Depletion of platelets worsened organ injury during septic
shock, whereas transfusion of platelets significantly reduced
mortality. These findings imply that platelets have a beneficial
role in sepsis and protect against septic shock.
TNF-a has a key role in sepsis pathogenesis21,22,25. Platelets
potentiate macrophage-derived TNF-a production in response to
low-dose LPS (r100 pg ml  1) under conditions where TNF-a
increased only several fold over the baseline level38,39. Platelets
also potentiate TNF-a production and inflammation in the mice
injected with low-dose LPS40,41. Although we observed that
platelets enhanced low-dose LPS (1 ng ml  1)-elicited TNF-a
production, our findings demonstrate that platelets dramatically
inhibit high-dose LPS (Z10 ng ml  1)-induced TNF-a and
IL-6 production by macrophages. Platelets also inhibited
human macrophage-derived TNF-a production (Supplementary
Fig. S4). Therefore, platelets appear to serve as a switch for the
inflammatory response during sepsis in that they may promote
inflammation at early stage of infection, but inhibit macrophage￾dependent inflammation when plasma concentrations of LPS
are high. Plasma LPS concentration, which can reach several
ng ml  1 to over 100 mg ml  1, in severe sepsis carries prognostic
significance. High LPS concentrations are associated with
increased adverse outcome and higher mortality rate42,43.
Plasma IL-6 also predicts mortality in sepsis24,44. Although
antibiotics decrease the overall mortality of septic mice, all
animals with IL-6 levels in plasma 414.0 ng ml  1 die, regardless
of whether they receive antibiotics24, suggesting that uncontrolled
inflammation is an important cause of mortality. Interestingly, in
the bacterial infusion sepsis model, we observed 100% mortality
in control mice (injected with IgG) that had plasma IL-6
concentrations 414.0 ng ml  1, whereas all of the mice with
plasma IL-6 concentrations o14.0 ng ml  1 survived. Plasma
IL-6 levels in thrombocytopenic mice increased 10- and 29-fold
over control animals (463 and 176 ng ml  1, respectively) at
4 and 8 h after injection of bacteria. TNF-a concentrations in
thrombocytopenic mice increased 77-fold over controls at 2 h
after injection of bacteria. These data indicate that platelets have
an essential role in modulating inflammation during sepsis, and
that thrombocytopenia, which often occurs in severe septic
patients, may be an important cause for the uncontrolled
inflammation and death.
A previous study reported lethal lung haemorrhage in
thrombocytopenic mice challenged with LPS19. In that study,
the anti-GPIba monoclonal antibody was injected intravenously,
which resulted in a lowering of platelet count to o2.5% of that of
control mice. They then performed platelet transfusion studies to
determine the minimal concentration of platelets that was
required for preventing inflammatory bleeding. Platelets from
IL4Ra/GPIba transgenic mice, which were resistant to the anti￾GPIba antibody, were injected into the inflamed mice. It was
found that 10–15% of normal platelet counts was sufficient to
prevent inflammatory bleeding19. In our study, thrombo￾cytopenia was elicited by i.p. injection of an anti-GPIba

monoclonal antibody, which lowered platelet counts to B10% of
control. Consistent with previous studies, which reported that
platelet counts of 10–15% normal were sufficient to prevent
inflammatory bleeding19,45, no significant haemorrhage was
observed in the lungs and brains from the thrombocytopenic
mice. Therefore, in the present study, the increased mortality
from sepsis in thrombocytopenic mice does not appear to be due
to inflammatory haemorrhage, but rather to an exacerbated
inflammatory response. To reconcile previous findings19,20 with
our data, we induced thrombocytopenia in mice by retro-orbital
injection of the anti-GPIba antibody. In agreement with the
previous studies, retro-orbital injection of the anti-GPIba
antibody induced much severe thrombocytopenia (platelet
counts were reduced to o5% of that of control mice) and
injection of LPS caused severe lung haemorrhage (Supplementary
Fig. S5).
Our in-vitro and in vivo data suggest that the beneficial effect of
platelets is likely to be due to COX1-dependent generation of
PGE2 that acts on macrophage EP4 receptors. PGE2 is a key
macrophage modulator36,46–48. LPS stimulates COX2 expression
and PGE2 production in many cells by upregulating COX2
transcription through NF-kB-dependent pathways37,49,50.
However, COX1 is the dominant isoform in platelets. Previous
studies reported that pretreatment with non-steroidal anti￾inflammatory drugs enhances endotoxin-induced production of
TNF-a, IL-6 and IL-8 concentrations in the blood of human
volunteers51,52. Consistent with these findings, aspirin pretreated
mice had significantly higher plasma TNF-a and IL-6
concentrations and reduced survival rate than that of control
mice in the LPS-induced sepsis model. COX metabolizes
arachidonic acid to many biologically active eicosanoids such as
prostaglandins, prostacyclins and thromboxane, and both COX1
and COX2 are activated during sepsis. However, they appear to
have distinct roles in septic shock. Although aspirin reduced the
survival rate in LPS-challenged mice, a COX2-specific inhibitor
NS-398 increased the survival rate in LPS-induced
endotoxemia53, suggesting that in contrast to COX1, COX2-
derived products aggravate sepsis. Platelet-specific deletion of
COX1 or the PGE2 synthase may be helpful in further evaluating
the protective role of platelets in septic shock. Our data do suggest
that other pathways may also be involved in platelet inhibition of
macrophage function, because aspirin or COX1 deficiency only
partially reversed platelet inhibition of LPS-induced TNF-a
production by macrophages (Fig. 6a,b). In fact, following
injection of COX1-deficient platelets, plasma TNF-a concentra￾tions were lower, although to a lesser degree than that observed
after injection of wild-type platelets (Fig. 7a). In this regard, a
previous study showed that platelet-derived microparticles
reduced the release of TNF-a by macrophages activated with
LPS54.
Platelet transfusion has been recommended in septic patients
with severe thrombocytopenia, in particular in patients with
bleeding or in patients at risk for bleeding55. Historically, the
purpose of platelet transfusion in sepsis is to halt or prevent
bleeding. Our results suggest a potential beneficial effect of
platelet transfusion in modulating immune response in sepsis,
especially in the severe septic patients. Further studies of platelet
transfusion in high-risk sepsis patients may be warranted.
Methods
Mice. Mice deficient in Gaq (ref. 29), P2Y12 (ref. 56), TP57, Munc 13-4 (Unc13dJinx
mice)35, COX1 (ref. 58) and wild-type littermates from heterozygous breeding were
used in this study. C57BL/6J mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories. Mice
were bred and maintained in the University of Kentucky Animal Care Facility,
following institutional and National Institutes of Health guidelines after approval
by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Eight- to 12-week-old males
with a variety of genetic manipulations were used in most experiments.
Preparation of mouse platelets. Blood was collected from the abdominal aortas
of isoflurane-anaesthetized mice (8–10 weeks) using 1/7 volume of ACD (85 mM
trisodium citrate, 83 mM dextrose and 21 mM citric acid) as the anticoagulant59.
Platelets were then washed once with CGS (0.12 M sodium chloride, 0.0129 M
trisodium citrate and 0.03 MD-glucose, pH 6.5), resuspended in saline at 5  109
per ml for in vivo experiments or in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 mM
HEPES at 3  108 per ml for in-vitro experiments and incubated for 1 h at 22 C
before use.
Survival studies. LPS endotoxemia model: male mice (8–10 weeks old) were
injected i.p. with 10 mg kg  1 LPS (0111:B4, purchased from Sigma) in a volume of
200 ml that was diluted in saline. Survival after LPS challenge was assessed every
12 h for 3 days. All survived mice were killed at the end of the third day.
Bacterial infusion sepsis model: E. coli ATCC 25922 was grown in Luria broth
medium overnight. After washing once with sterile saline, the bacteria were
resuspended and diluted in sterile saline. Male mice (8–10 weeks old) were injected
i.p. with bacteria in a volume of 200 ml saline. Survival after injection of bacteria
was assessed every 4 h for 3 days. All survived mice were killed at the end of the
third day.
Platelet depletion and transfusion. Mice were injected i.p. with a commercially
available rat antimouse GPIba monoclonal antibody (Emfret Analytics, Wurzburg,
Germany, 4 mg g  1 body weight) for platelet depletion. Mice were injected with
same amount of isotype-matched rat IgG as controls. For platelet counts, mice were
bled from the retro-orbital plexus under isoflurane anaesthesia (IsoFlo; Abbott
Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL). Blood was collected into a heparin-containing tube
and added with 10 mM (final concentration) EDTA as an anticoagulant.
Platelet counts in whole blood were analysed with a HEMAVET HV950FS
multispecies haematology analyser. For platelet transfusion, 1  109 washed
platelets resuspended in 0.2 ml saline were injected into the retro-orbital plexus for
each recipient mouse.
Macrophage depletion. Mice were injected retro-orbitally with 40 mg kg  1 of
liposomal clodronate (L-a-Phosphatidyl-choline/cholesterol clodronate; Encapsula
NanoSciences, Nashville, TN) at 24 and 4 h, respectively, before being challenged
with LPS. The same amount of plain liposomes were injected as control. This
method is specific for depletion of monocytes and macrophages, which undergo
apoptosis following phagocytosis of the liposomal clodronate. Depletion of
monocytes/macrophages was confirmed by flow cytometry analysis. EDTA antic￾oagulated blood was subjected to red blood cell lysis. White blood cells were
resuspended in flow buffer (Hank’s balanced salt solution with 0.1% BSA and
5 mM EDTA) and incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-labelled anti-CD115 and APC￾Cy7-labelled anti-CD45 antibodies.
Isolation of macrophages. Macrophages were isolated from mouse bone marrow
and plated in a plastic flask60. Bone marrow macrophages were cultured for
7 days in the presence of 15% conditional medium from L929 cells.
Blood chemistry and cytokine measurements. Aspartate aminotransferase,
alanine aminotransferase, CK and LDH were measured by Comparative Clinical
Pathology Services (Columbia, MO). TNF-a and IL-6 were measured by ELISA
assay (eBioscience, San Diego, CA). To observe the effects of platelets on TNF-a
and IL-6 production in macrophages, washed platelets or medium were incubated
with LPS (100 ng ml  1) for 30 min and added to 2  105 macrophages precoated
in 96-well plates. To observe the effects of platelet releasates on TNF-a and IL-6
production in macrophages, washed platelets were incubated with LPS
(100 ng ml  1) at room temperature for 30 min or thrombin (0.1 U ml  1) in an
aggregometer with stirring at 1,000 r.p.m. at 37 C for 5 min and then centrifuged at
2,500 r.p.m. at 22 C for 3 min. Supernatants from LPS- or thrombin-stimulated
platelets were added with LPS to 96-well plates precoated with 2  105 macro￾phages per well and incubated at 37 C for 6 h.
Histologic examination. Mice were injected i.p. with an antimouse GPIba
monoclonal antibody or control IgG. After 4 h, LPS (10 mg kg  1) was injected i.p.
Mice were anaesthetized and the lungs and brains were isolated at 15 h after
injection of LPS. The lungs and brains were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in
0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) for 2 days at 4 C and then processed to paraffin
embedding. Sections were cut at 5 mm and stained by haematoxylin and eosin.
Images were captured with a Leica DM IRB microscope using  20 objective (Leica
Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany).
Statistical analyses. The survival assay was analysed by Wald’s test in a discrete
time hazard model using version 9.2 of SAS software. Significance in experiments
comparing two groups was examined by unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test.
Values are reported as the mean±s.d. A value of Po0.05 was considered
significant.
