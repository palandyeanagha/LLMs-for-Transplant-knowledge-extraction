Echocardiographic estimation of mean pulmonary
artery pressure in critically ill patients
Russell D Laver1*, Ubbo F Wiersema1 and Andrew D Bersten1,2
Abstract
Background: Indirect assessment of mean pulmonary arterial pressure (MPAP) may assist management of critically
ill patients with pulmonary hypertension and right heart dysfunction. MPAP can be estimated as the sum of
echocardiographically derived mean right ventricular to right atrial systolic pressure gradient and right atrial
pressure; however, this has not been validated in critically ill patients.
Methods: This prospective validation study was conducted in patients undergoing pulmonary artery catheterisation
during intensive care admission. Pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) measurements of MPAP were contemporaneously
compared to MPAP estimated utilising transthoracic echocardiography (TTE)-derived mean right ventricular to right
atrial systolic pressure gradient added to invasively measured right atrial pressure.
Results: Of 53 patients assessed, 23 had estimable MPAP using TTE. The mean difference between TTE- and
PAC-derived MPAP was 1.9 mmHg (SD 5.0), with upper and lower limits of agreement of 11.6 and −7.9 mmHg,
respectively. The median absolute percentage difference between TTE- and PAC-derived MPAP was 7.5%. Inter-rater
reliability assessment was performed for 15 patients, giving an intra-class correlation coefficient of 0.96 (95%
confidence intervals, 0.89 to 0.99).
Conclusions: This echocardiographic method of estimating MPAP in critically ill patients was not equivalent to
invasively measured MPAP, based on our predefined clinically acceptable range (±5 mmHg). The accuracy of this
method in critically ill patients was similar to the results obtained in ambulatory patients and compared favourably
with regard to the accuracy with echocardiographic estimation of systolic pulmonary arterial pressure. The utility of
this technique is limited by frequent inability to obtain an adequate tricuspid regurgitant time-velocity integral in
critically ill patients.

Background
Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a common problem in
critically ill patients and is associated with right heart
dysfunction and increased morbidity and mortality [1].
Historically, the intensive care physician has used the
pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) to measure pulmonary
pressures. Although still considered the reference standard
for diagnosis and quantification of PH in the critically ill
[2,3], growing concerns regarding the risk of complica￾tions and lack of demonstrated outcome benefit with
PAC-guided haemodynamic monitoring have led to a
reduction in PAC use over recent years [4].
The increased availability of point-of-care ultrasound
machines in the intensive care unit (ICU) has facilitated
the use of echocardiography as an alternative to the PAC
for the evaluation of the haemodynamically unstable pa￾tient. Estimation of systolic pulmonary arterial pressure
(SPAP) from the peak tricuspid regurgitant velocity is
the most widely used echocardiographic measure of PH
severity and has been validated in a broad range of clin￾ical situations, although concerns about accuracy remain
[5]. Mean pulmonary arterial pressure (MPAP), however,
is the preferred measure to diagnose, assess severity and
determine response to therapy in PH [6]. Previous echo￾cardiographic methods of estimating MPAP require the
presence of pulmonary regurgitation and precise time
interval measurements or are based on empiric formulas

extrapolated from SPAP estimates, making them poorly
suited to the ICU environment [5,7-10].
Recently, Aduen and colleagues described a new, sim￾pler echocardiographic method of estimating MPAP cal￾culated as mean right ventricular to right atrial (RV-RA)
systolic pressure gradient plus right atrial pressure (RAP)
[6]. Mean RV-RA gradient was estimated from the tricus￾pid regurgitant time-velocity integral, obtained from the
continuous wave Doppler interrogation of the tricuspid
regurgitant jet. RAP was estimated echocardiographically.
The study demonstrated satisfactory correlation between
the echocardiographic estimate and PAC data but was
confined to ambulatory patients. Critically ill patients may
differ due to acute changes in pulmonary pressures, effects
of positive intra-thoracic pressure (mechanical ventilation)
and difficulties in obtaining acoustic windows.
Our aim in the present study was to establish the accur￾acy of this new echocardiographic method of MPAP esti￾mation in a critically ill patient population. Furthermore,
we attempted to increase the accuracy of our results by
direct measurement of RAP, rather than echocardio￾graphic estimation with its associated inaccuracies [5,11].
Methods
Setting
This prospective validation study was conducted at
Flinders Medical Centre Intensive and Critical Care
Unit, South Australia, a large metropolitan tertiary
ICU, between February 2011 and February 2012. The
study was approved by the Flinders Clinical Research
Ethics Committee, Southern Adelaide Health Service
(450.10). Informed consent was gained from all patients or
next of kin where appropriate.
Patients
Consecutive patients aged 18 years and over admitted to
the ICU who had a PAC in situ were assessed for eligi￾bility. Exclusion criteria were patient refusal, inability to
obtain informed consent or patient factors making trans￾thoracic echocardiography (TTE) assessment impossible.
Patient demographics were recorded.
Echocardiographic examination
A Sonosite M-Turbo® ultrasound machine with phased
array (1 to 5 MHz) transducer was used for echocardio￾graphic assessments. Patients were assessed in the supine
or semi-recumbent position. Limited TTE was performed
to estimate MPAP and SPAP from the tricuspid regurgi￾tant jet. The view providing the most complete enve￾lope, with the highest-velocity regurgitant jet, was used
for measurements.
The average of three each of peak and mean RV-RA sys￾tolic gradients was calculated and recorded. Peak RV-RA
gradient was estimated using the modified Bernoulli
equation [5]. Mean RV-RA systolic gradient was esti￾mated using the method described by Aduen and col￾leagues [6]. SPAP and MPAP were calculated by adding
the PAC-derived RAP to peak and mean RV-RA gradi￾ents, respectively. All measurements were obtained at
end expiration (Figure 1).
All assessments were performed by the same echocar￾diographer (RL, an advanced trainee in intensive care
medicine). When available, a second echocardiographer
(UW, a consultant intensivist) performed an assessment
immediately afterwards, allowing an estimation of inter￾rater reliability. The primary echocardiographer was blinded
to PAC measurements. The second echocardiographer

was blinded to the primary echocardiographer's TTE
measurements.
Pulmonary artery catheter
The decision to utilise a PAC to guide patient manage￾ment was determined independently by the treating inten￾sivist. PAC data was recorded during or immediately after
echocardiographic assessment. The transducer was zeroed
and levelled to the level of the right atrium, taken as 5 cm
vertically below the manubriosternal junction, thus mini￾mising the effect of differences in patient position or an￾teroposterior (AP) chest wall diameter [12].
Measurements obtained from the PAC included SPAP,
diastolic pulmonary arterial pressure (DPAP), RAP and
pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (PAOP). MPAP was
calculated as (SPAP − DPAP) / 3 + DPAP [13]. An average
of three measurements was taken at end expiration, with
the patient supine or semi-recumbent (unchanged from
TTE assessment).
Cardiac index was calculated as cardiac output (most
recent measurement, assessed by thermodilution) divided
by body surface area [14]. Other measurements recorded
included heart rate, rhythm and systemic mean arterial
pressure (MAP).
Statistical analysis
Utilising the concept of equivalence [15], it was estimated
that an adequately powered trial would consist of 25
patients with 95% confidence intervals for a clinically
acceptable difference of ±5 mmHg between the gold
standard (PAC) and TTE-determined MPAP.
The mean and standard deviation (SD) of the differ￾ences between PAC- and TTE-derived measurements of
MPAP is reported. Upper and lower limits of agreement
(i.e. 2SD) were calculated using Bland-Altman analysis
[16], assuming normal distribution of differences between
PAC- and TTE-derived measurements. A priori subgroup
analysis was performed for mechanically ventilated and
spontaneously ventilating patients. Absolute percentage
differences were calculated as the absolute value of the dif￾ference between TTE- and PAC-derived measurements
divided by the PAC-derived measurement and expressed
as a percentage.
Data are expressed as number (percentage) for cat￾egorical variables and mean (±SD) for continuous vari￾ables where appropriate. Independent samples t tests
were used to determine the relationship between con￾tinuous and categorical variables. Chi-squared test for
independence was used to determine the relationship
between categorical variables (Fisher's exact test used
when values in any cell are <5). Inter-rater reliability
was assessed using intra-class correlation analysis, utilising
a two-way mixed model (single measures) with absolute
agreement for measurements. SPSS version 19.0 was used
for all statistical analysis.
Results
A total of 55 patients were screened for study eligibility.
Two patients declined participation, leaving 53 patients
who were assessed echocardiographically. A further 30
patients were excluded due to inability to obtain a measur￾able tricuspid regurgitation (TR) envelope. Of those with
unmeasurable TR, 13 patients had no detectable TR (43%),
9 had a poor-quality regurgitant envelope (30%) and 8 had
poor acoustic windows (27%). The final 23 patients
underwent TTE examination to determine MPAP, SPAP
and RAP echocardiographically (Figure 2).
Patient demographics for the 53 patients who underwent
TTE assessment are shown in Table 1. Characteristics sig￾nificantly associated with unmeasurable TR envelope were
increased chest wall diameter, male gender and mechanical
ventilation. Haemodynamic variables measured from the
53 patients who underwent TTE assessment are shown in
Table 2. Haemodynamic variables significantly associated
with unmeasurable TR envelope were lower SPAP and
PAOP and higher MAP.
In patients with a measurable TR envelope, the apical
4-chamber was the most frequently obtained acoustic
window to demonstrate TR and was most commonly used
for measurements. The subcostal 4-chamber was the least

frequently obtained and least commonly used for mea￾surements (Table 3).
For the primary echocardiographer, the bias between
TTE- and PAC-derived MPAP was 1.9 mmHg (SD 5.0),
with upper and lower limits of agreement of 11.6 and
−7.9 mmHg, respectively (Figure 3). The median absolute
percentage difference between TTE- and PAC-derived
MPAP was 7.5%. For mechanically ventilated patients, the
bias between TTE- and PAC-derived MPAP was 2.4 mmHg
(SD 4.1), with upper and lower limits of agreement of 10.4
and −5.6 mmHg, respectively. For spontaneously ventilating
patients, the bias between TTE- and PAC-derived MPAP
was 1.5 mmHg (SD 5.6), with upper and lower limits of
agreement of 12.4 and −9.4 mmHg, respectively.
The bias between TTE- and PAC-derived SPAP
was −1.7 mmHg (SD 8.1), with upper and lower limits
of agreement of 14.2 and −17.5 mmHg, respectively
(Figure 4). The median absolute percentage difference
between TTE- and PAC-derived SPAP was 1.9%.
For the 15 patients examined by both echocardiog￾raphers, inter-rater reliability assessment was performed,
giving an intra-class correlation coefficient of 0.96 (95%
confidence intervals, 0.89 to 0.99).
Discussion
Echocardiographic estimation of MPAP was not equiva￾lent to invasively measured MPAP according to our

between TTE- and PAC-derived MPAP was small at
1.9 mmHg; however, upper and lower limits of agree￾ment (11.6 and −7.9 mmHg) lay outside our clinically
acceptable range. The limits of agreement between TTE￾and PAC-derived MPAP were similar for mechanically
ventilated and spontaneously ventilating patients, but the
study was underpowered to detect a significant difference
between these two groups.
Our results were similar to those reported by Aduen
and colleagues (bias between TTE-estimated and PAC￾measured MPAP of −1.6 mmHg, with upper and lower
limits of agreement of −16.6 to 13.7 mmHg, respect￾ively) [6]. The improved accuracy of MPAP estimation
in our study, as suggested by narrower limits of agree￾ment, may be attributed to the use of invasively mea￾sured RAP.
Inter-rater reliability for the 15 patients who were exam￾ined by both echocardiographers was excellent (intra-class
correlation coefficient of 0.96); however, only the primary
echocardiographer was blinded to PAC measurements,
limiting interpretation of this result.
Major strengths of this study included contemporan￾eous TTE and PAC assessments in a heterogenous
group of critically unwell patients and direct measure￾ment of RAP. Invasively measured RAP minimised the
effect of any error in phlebostatic axis determination on
MPAP measurement. The original trial by Aduen and
coworkers used mid-thorax level as the phlebostatic axis,
which may have affected the measurements obtained.
The PAC was used as the reference standard. Dynamic
response and reproducibility of the pulmonary arterial
waveform are known to vary considerably with PAC [17].
Ideally dynamic calibration would have been undertaken
prior to measurements, but this would have increased
the complexity of the study substantially and mean
pressure is a relatively robust measure, less affected by
dynamic response.
Heart rate was not shown to affect accuracy of MPAP
estimation. In patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), it was
noted that there was large beat-to-beat variability in the
magnitude of the tricuspid regurgitant jet and pulmonary
arterial pressure trace. Eight of 23 patients (35%) were in
AF at the time of echocardiographic assessment. When
subjects were analysed according to their underlying heart
rhythm, the groups were not dissimilar, although the study
was underpowered to detect significant differences. Deter￾mining the accuracy of this method of MPAP estimation
in patients with AF would require averaging measure￾ments over a larger number of cardiac cycles or ideally
simultaneous TTE and PAC analysis for a single cardiac
cycle.
A significant limitation of the study was the inability
to estimate MPAP echocardiographically in the major￾ity of patients screened. Only 23 of 53 patients (43%)
assessed echocardiographically had adequately visua￾lised TR to allow estimation of MPAP, leaving the study
underpowered. A previous study by Bouhemad and col￾leagues observed the presence of TR in 85% of hypoxemic
mechanically ventilated critically ill patients [10]. It is
likely that satisfactory imaging could have been obtained
in more patients had they been optimally positioned and a
higher-end echocardiography machine used. However, the

point-of-care device used was representative of the tech￾nology available in the ICU for repeated TTE assessments
by clinicians at the bedside. Agitated saline may have im￾proved the quality of the TR envelope to allow estimation
of MPAP in selected cases. Agitated saline was not used in
our study as it was not demonstrated to improve MPAP
estimation in the original trial [6]; however, it has been
shown to improve accuracy of SPAP measurement [18].
Transesophageal echocardiography may also have a role,
given the difficulties in obtaining acoustic windows in crit￾ically ill patients utilising TTE.
Increased AP chest wall diameter, mechanical venti￾lation and male gender were associated with reduced
ability to obtain MPAP estimates. Difficulty obtaining
MPAP estimates in men may be secondary to increased
AP chest wall diameter (mean male AP chest wall
diameter was 23.3 vs 18.5 cm for females). It was ex￾pected that TTE assessment would be more accessible
in medical patients, as opposed to post-cardiothoracic
surgical patients [19-21]. Post-cardiothoracic surgery
patients were no less likely to have measurable TR than
other diagnostic groups. However, only patients in the
cardiothoracic surgical group had unmeasurable TR
due to poor acoustic windows (8 of 20 cardiothoracic
surgical patients assessed, 40%).
Haemodynamic variables associated with inability to es￾timate MPAP included lower SPAP and PAOP and higher
MAP. Lower SPAP was predictably associated with re￾duced ability to measure TR, as increased SPAP is known
to be associated with increased severity of TR [22]. There
was a non-significant trend towards reduced ability to esti￾mate MPAP at lower measured MPAP. Higher PAOP may
also increase TR secondary to elevations in pulmonary ar￾terial pressure and right ventricular afterload.
This method of echocardiographic estimation of MPAP
has not, at this time, entered into routine clinical practice.
Subsequent study has demonstrated similar accuracy
and precision to formulas deriving MPAP from SPAP
[23]. As stated in the original trial by Aduen and co￾workers, this alternative estimate of MPAP was compar￾able in reliability and accuracy with traditional SPAP
estimation. TTE-estimated SPAP compared to estimated
MPAP had a similar bias (−1.7 vs 1.9 mmHg) and smaller
median absolute percentage difference between invasive
measures (1.9% vs 7.5%), but as expected (due to higher
absolute numbers), limits of agreement were wider for
SPAP estimation. Given the comparable accuracy of TTE￾estimated SPAP and MPAP, there may be a role for echo￾cardiographic estimation of MPAP using this technique as
part of a comprehensive right heart assessment, rather
than as a stand-alone measure.
Conclusions
Transthoracic echocardiographically estimated mean pul￾monary artery pressure utilising mean right ventricular to
right atrial systolic pressure gradient added to invasively
measured right atrial pressure in critically ill patients was
not equivalent to invasively measured mean pulmonary ar￾terial pressure from right heart catheterisation based on a
predefined clinically acceptable range of ±5 mmHg. The
accuracy of this method in critically ill patients was com￾parable to results obtained in ambulatory patients [6] and
compared favourably with regard to accuracy with echo￾cardiographic estimation of systolic pulmonary arterial
pressure. Requirement for the presence of tricuspid regur￾gitation and an acceptable Doppler signal may limit appli￾cation of this technique.
