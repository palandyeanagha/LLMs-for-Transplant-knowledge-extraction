Abstract
Background: Kidneys derived from brain dead donors have lower graft survival and higher graft-function loss
compared to their living donor counterpart. Heat Shock Proteins (HSP) are a large family of stress proteins involved
in maintaining cell homeostasis. We studied the role of stress-inducible genes Heme Oxygenase-1 (HO-1), HSP27,
HSP40, and HSP70 in the kidney following a 4 hour period of brain death.
Methods: Brain death was induced in rats (n=6) by inflating a balloon catheter in the epidural space. Kidneys were
analysed for HSPs using RT-PCR, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry.
Results: RT-PCR data showed a significant increase in gene expression for HO-1 and HSP70 in kidneys of brain
dead rats. Western blotting revealed a massive increase in HO-1 protein in brain dead rat kidneys.
Immunohistochemistry confirmed these findings, showing extensive HO-1 protein expression in the renal cortical
tubules of brain dead rats. HSP70 protein was predominantly increased in renal distal tubules of brain dead rats
treated for hypotension.
Conclusion: Renal stress caused by brain death induces expression of the cytoprotective genes HO-1 and HSP70,
but not of HSP27 and HSP40. The upregulation of these cytoprotective genes indicate that renal damage occurs
during brain death, and could be part of a protective or recuperative mechanism induced by brain
death-associated stress.

Background
Renal transplantation leads to a significantly improved
prognosis for the majority of patients with end-stage renal
disease. Most kidneys used for renal transplantation are
derived from brain dead donors. These kidneys, however,
are known to have inferior organ quality and survival
compared to kidneys from living related donors [1,2]. The
knowledge on the (patho)-physiological processes initiated
by brain death that are responsible for this observation are
not fully elucidated. Previous studies indicated that the
brain death causes marked inflammatory changes in per￾ipheral organs [3] and incites various (patho)-physiological
processes, like hemodynamic instability [4] and hormone
dysregulation [5]. The inflammatory changes in liver and
kidney, as evidenced by an increase in CD45+ leukocytes,
coincide with upregulation of cell adhesion molecule ex￾pression (ICAM-1, VCAM-1, E-selectin) and apoptosis
[6–9]. The hemodynamic instability, displayed by a short
hypertensive phase at the onset of brain death followed by
a decline in blood pressure to normal tension or
hypotension, could cause poor organ perfusion and thereby
an inadequate oxygen delivery to the peripheral tissues,
resulting in organ damage.
Heat-shock proteins (HSP) are a diverse group of pro￾teins involved in cellular homeostasis and display cyto￾protective effects in different forms of stress, mostly
ascribed to their role as molecular chaperones. HSPs act
in, for example, protein folding, protein assembly, protein
aggregation, intracellular transport, and degradation of
damaged substances (for review, see references [10,11]). It
has been shown that heat-shock proteins, which are num￾bered according to their approximate molecular mass in

kDa, have a protective role in ischemia/reperfusion injury
by repairing damaged proteins and thereby removing the
stimulus for apoptosis [10,12–20]. Upregulation of HSP70
prior to transplantation improves graft survival and func￾tion [19–22]. Selective upregulation of heme oxygenase-1
(HO-1, also known as HSP32) has shown similar graft￾protective effects in the kidney, heart and liver [23–27].
Furthermore, HO-1 has immunosuppressive characteris￾tics [25,28,29], that are likely mediated in part by produc￾tion of carbon monoxide (CO) during heme degradation,
which possibly induces vasodilatation and attenuates pro￾inflammatory processes during brain death.
There is only very limited knowledge about the effects
of brain death on the expression of HSPs in the kidney.
To evaluate possible renal recuperative and/or protective
mechanisms induced during brain death, we studied kid￾neys from rats exposed to a 4 hour period of brain death
for presence of HSP27, HSP40, HSP70, and HO-1
protein and mRNA.
Methods
Animals
Adult male Fisher F344 rats weighing 278–310 grams
were used (Harlan, Horst, The Netherlands) in this
study. Average weight was 285±18 grams. The rats were
housed in a light- and temperature-controlled environ￾ment and had free access to food and water. All animals
received care in compliance with the guidelines of the
local animal ethics committee according to Experiments
on Animals Act (1996) issued by the Ministry of Public
Health, Welfare and Sports of the Netherlands.
Brain death induction
Rats were anesthetized using isoflurane with a mixture
of NO2 and O2 during brain death induction. They were
intubated via a tracheostomy by a blunt-tipped cannula
and mechanically respirated. The animals were venti￾lated on a small rodent ventilator (Zoovent, Triumph
Technical Services Ltd, UK) with 4 liter/min O2 in air
for 30 min (stroke rate: 46 per min, inspiration/expir￾ation: 1/2, peak inspiratory pressure: 16 mmHg, mean
inspiratory pressure: 6 mmHg, and a positive end expira￾tory pressure: 0 mmHg). After that, they were ventilated
with 0.5 liter/min O2 in air until the end of the brain
death period.
Brain death induction was performed by drilling a
1×1 mm hole through the frontomedial part of the
skull, just lateral of the central vein. A no.4 Fogarty
catheter (Edwards Life Sciences Co., Irvine, CA, USA)
was inserted in the epidural space with the tip pointing
caudally. To simulate an epidural haematoma leading
to brain death, intracranial pressure was increased
gradually by slow inflation of the balloon (16 μl saline
per min) using a syringe pump (Terufusion, Termo
Co., Tokyo, Japan). Inflation of the balloon was
stopped after approximately 25 min, when the blood
pressure reached normal levels after an initial phase of
hypotension. During balloon inflation, the sharp rise of
blood pressure that is typical in brain death develop￾ment was seen. Brain death was verified 30 minutes
after the start of balloon inflation by an apnoea test,
confirmation of dilated and fixed pupils and the ab￾sence of corneal reflexes. The average balloon volume
that consistently induced brain death was (420±20 μl).
The balloon was kept inflated during the entire experi￾ment. Blood pressure was monitored via a PE cannula
(0.40×0.80 mm) implanted in the left femoral artery.
Blood pressure above 80 mmHg was considered
normotensive. When blood pressure dropped beneath
80 mmHg, rats were infused with 10% hydroxyethyl
starch (HAES) until normotension was reached. Body
temperature, measured with a rectal thermoprobe
(Mon-a-therm 6510, Mallinckrodt Medical, Inc.,
St. Louis, MO, USA), was maintained at 37°C by means
of a heating pad and lamp.
After 4 hours of brain death, isoflurane 0.5% anaesthe￾sia with a mixture of NO2 and O2 was used 10 minutes
before the end of the brain death period to achieve full
muscle relaxation in order to allow abdominal surgery.
Left kidneys were removed after perfusion with cold sa￾line and cut in two sections, one part was snap frozen in
liquid nitrogen, the other part was fixated in 4%
paraformaldehyde.
RNA isolation and semi quantitative RT-PCR
Total RNA was isolated from snap frozen renal tissue
using the SV Total RNA Isolation System (Promega,
Madison, Wisconsin, USA) according to the manufac￾turer’s protocol. Briefly, cDNA synthesis from total RNA
included an initial step in which 1 μg of RNA is
incubated with T11VN oligo’s (0.5 μg) for 10 minutes at
70°C. Subsequently, buffer, dNTP’s (final conc. 1 mM),
DTT (final conc. 10 mM), 200 U M-MLV Reverse
Transcriptase and 20 U RNaseOUT™ Recombinant
Ribonuclease Inhibitor (all from Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
California, USA) were added and incubated for 50 min
at 37°C, after which the reaction was inactivated by a
15 min incubation at 70°C. Two μl of cDNA was ampli￾fied by PCR in a buffer consisting of 0.2 mM dNTP’s,
1.5 mM MgCl2, 1x PCR buffer and 1 U Taq DNA poly￾merase (all from Invitrogen). Gene-specific primer pairs
(0.5 μM each) were added directly, after which they were
heated for 3 min at 94°C. PCR was performed on a T1
Thermocycler (Biometra) and cycles consisted of 94°C
for 40 s, a primer annealing temperature at 56°C for 40 s
and a polymerization step at 72°C for 40 s. The numbers

of cycles were selected to allow amplification within the
linear range.
The primer sequences, the number of cycles and their
respective PCR fragment lengths were:
HO-1: 5’-ACTTTCAGAAGGGTCAGGTGTCC-3’,
5’-TTGAGCAGGAAGGCGGTCTTAG-3’,
28 cycles, 523 bp;
HSP27: 5’-AAGGCTTCTACTTGGCTCCAG-3’,
5’-ACATGGCTACATCTCTCGGTG-3’,
26 cycles, 226 bp;
HSP40, 5’-GAAACTGCAACCACAGAGAGC-3’,
5’-GGATGGAAATCCCTGACTAGC-3’,
40 cycles, 275 bp;
HSP70, 5’-CTGACAAGAAGAAGGTGCTGG-3’,
5’-AGCAGCCATCAAGAGTCTGTC-3’,
25 cycles, 302 bp.
Primer pairs were developed using Primer3 (http://bio￾informatics.weizmann.ac.il/cgi-bin/primer/primer3.cgi).
Ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels were scanned on
Image MasterW VDS (Amersham Biosciences, UK) using
LISCAP software. PCR product abundance was quantified
using Imagemaster 1D Elite (Amersham) and normalized
for the abundance of the β-actin signal from the same
cDNA.
Western blotting
Per sample, three 20 μm cryostat sections were lysed in 200
μL RIPA buffer (1% NP40, 0.1% SDS, 10 mM β-mercap￾toethanol) containing protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche).
Samples were lysed on ice, centrifuged for 15 min at 16000g
(4°C) and supernatants collected. Protein concentrations
were measured using the Lowry Protein assay (BioRad). 7.5
μg of total protein was separated by SDS-PAGE (Sodium
Dodecyl Sulphate PolyAcrylamide Gel Electrophoresis) on
10% polyacrylamide gels using the BioRad electrophoresis
system. Proteins were electroblotted (BioRad blotting
system) onto PVDF membranes (Hybond, Amersham) after
which immune detection was performed. Briefly, mem￾branes were blocked in PBS (6.5 mM Na2HPO4, 1.5 mM
KH2PO4, 2.7 mM KCl and 150 mM NaCl; pH 7.2) with
0.05% Tween (PBST) containing 5% SKIM, overnight.
Incubation with primary antibodies directed to HSP27
(SPA-801), HSP40 (SPA-400), HSP70 (SPA-810) and HO-1
(OSA-111, all by StressGen, Victoria, BC, Canada) for 2
hours was followed by 1 hr incubation with an appropriate
secondary antibody conjugated to peroxidase in blocking
buffer at 1:2000 dilution. After each incubation step, mem￾branes were washed 5 times in PBST. Bound antibodies
were detected with ECL Western blotting detection system
(Amersham, UK) according to the manufacturer’s protocols.
Detected signal was quantified and normalized for the
GAPDH signal on the same blot.
Immunohistochemistry
For localization of HSP40, HSP70 and HO-1, paraffin sec￾tions (4 μm) were de-waxed, rehydrated and subjected to
heat-induced antigen retrieval by microwave heating in 10
mM citrate buffer (pH=6.0, HSP40), 1 mM EDTA
(pH=8.0, HSP70), or by overnight incubation in 0.1 M
Tris/HCl buffer at 80°C (pH=9.0, HO-1). Endogenous per￾oxidase was blocked with 0.03% H2O2 in phosphate￾buffered saline (PBS) for 30 minutes. Primary antibodies
used were identical to those used in Western blotting. In￾cubation lasted for 60 min at RT and binding of the anti￾body was detected by sequential incubation with
appropriate peroxidase-labelled secondary and tertiary anti￾bodies (Dakopatts, Glostrup, Denmark) for 30 min.
Antibody dilutions were made in phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA)
and 1% normal rat serum. The peroxidase activity was
visualised using 3,3’-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride
(DAB+, cat. no. K3468; DAKO). Finally, sections were
counterstained with haematoxylin.
For HSP27 staining, cryostat sections (4 μm) were
fixed in acetone for 10 min. Subsequently, they were
dried and incubated with the primary antibody (SPA￾801, StressGen) for 60 min at RT. Endogenous peroxid￾ase was blocked with 0.0075% H2O2 in PBS for 30 min.
Detection of binding was performed as described above.
Peroxidase activity was visualised using 3-amino-9-ethyl￾carbazole (AEC) for 15 min. Sections were counter￾stained with haematoxylin.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using the two-sided
Students T test, a p value <0.05 was considered signifi￾cant. Correlations between variables were assessed with
one-way ANOVA. Statistical analyses were performed
using SPSS version 18.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, US).
Results
Semi-quantitative RT-PCR
Renal expression of genes coding for HO-1 and HSP70
was significantly increased in kidneys of brain dead rats
compared to living controls (Figure 1). For HO-1 the in￾crease was 3.7 fold compared to controls (p<0.05),
HSP70 was increased 2.4 fold (p<0.05). Differences in
the expression of HSP27 and HSP40 were not observed
(Figure 1). Rats treated with substantial volumes of
hydroxyethyl starch (1.0-5.75 mL, n=3) for blood
pressure regulation showed a 3.8 fold (p<0.05) increased
expression of HSP70 compared to control rats. Rats
treated with scant volumes of hydroxyethyl starch (0–0.6
mL, n=3) showed a 1.7 fold increase, which was not sig￾nificant (p=0.25).

Figure 1 qPCR results showed a massive increase in renal HO-1 mRNA levels of brain dead rats. A significant increase in HSP70 expression
was also seen. qPCR for HSP27 and HSP40 did not reveal differences in mRNA expression between control and brain dead groups.

Figure 2 Western blotting showed a great increase in HO-1 protein levels. However, the increase in HSP70 mRNA did not lead to
measurable differences in protein levels at this time point. Protein levels of HSP27 and HSP40 did not differ between control and brain
dead groups.

Western blotting
A 4.6 fold increase (p<0.001) in HO-1 protein was
observed in brain dead rat kidneys compared to living
controls (Figure 2). Quantities of HSP70 protein did not
differ in the brain dead group (Figure 2), and no differ￾ences were detected between the normotensive and
hypotensive groups of brain dead rats. Levels of HSP27
and HSP40 protein showed no variation between brain
dead and control groups (Figure 2), confirming data
from immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, we found
significant positive correlations between the protein ex￾pression of HSP70 and the protein expressions of HSP40
(p<0.05, R2
=0.38) and HSP27 (p<0.05, R2
=0.94)
(Figure 3).
Immunohistochemistry
In control rats, weak cytoplasmatic HO-1 staining of some
proximal tubules of the renal cortex was observed
(Figure 4A). Glomeruli and arteries were negative, as well
as the collecting ducts and loops of Henle. In brain dead
rat kidneys at 4 hours after induction, HO-1 was massively
upregulated in the cortical proximal tubules (Figure 4B).
Also, some solitary tubular cells showed very intense stain￾ing compared to adjacent cells (Figure 4D), which was not
seen in controls (Figure 4C). Glomeruli were negative,
with the exception of some solitary cells, which could be
CD68-positive macrophages.
HSP70 staining was found in some single distal tubular
cells. Glomeruli were stained negative for HSP70
(Figure 5A). Upregulation of HSP70 was predominantly
seen in the renal distal tubules of the hypotensive rats
treated with hydroxyethyl starch as a volume replace￾ment, showing an increase in the number of positively
stained single cells (Figure 5B). In rats that remained
normotensive during brain death and thus were not
treated with hydroxyethyl starch, no difference in stain￾ing of HSP70 compared to controls was detected.
HSP27 was present in vascular smooth muscle cells of
renal arteries. Tubular staining was not detected, but
some glomerular staining was evident.
HSP40 was detected in the glomeruli, with visceral
and parietal epithelium stained positive. Also, some dis￾tal tubular and collecting duct staining was detected.
No detectable differences were found for HSP27 and
HSP40 between the brain dead and control group, con￾firming Western blot results.
Discussion
The major finding of the present study is that systemic
stress associated with brain death induces enhanced ex￾pression of protective genes in the donor kidney. These
data are in line with previous micro-array data showing
marked upregulation of various protective genes during
experimental brain death [30]. Since HO-1 is known to
attenuate damage in various stress models, such as is￾chemia/reperfusion and experimental transplantation,
we consider the significant increase of HO-1 protein and
mRNA in renal proximal tubules from brain dead rats a
recuperative mechanism in response to the injury caused
by the systemic effects of extensive brain injury.
Brain death induction can cause significant detrimental
effects on various donor organs. The “autonomic storm”,
an immediate release of massive amounts of catechola￾mines into the blood stream, occurs directly after the
onset of brain death. The hemodynamic changes cause
altered perfusion of the kidneys, possibly resulting in is￾chemic damage [4,31]. As a result of brain death and its
systemic effects increased pro-inflammatory reactivity in
donor organs takes place, as evidenced by upregulation of
cell adhesion molecules such as ICAM and selectins. The
increments in adhesion molecules are associated with
increased influx of inflammatory cells such as T-cells,
macrophages and polymorphonuclear neutrophils. These
early pro-inflammatory changes further progress to renal
Figure 3 Renal Western blot results from living and brain dead rats for HSP70 protein expression was found to correlate significantly
(R2

=0.94) with HSP27
protein expression.

fibrotic damage, a decrease in renal function, and inferior
graft survival [7,32,33].
Using immunohistochemistry in control rat kidneys, we
noted weak HO-1 staining in the proximal tubules, indi￾cating a physiological role for HO-1 in the kidney. Basal
expression of HO-1 in the normal human kidney, al￾though weak, is also found in the renal proximal tubules
[34] and in some CD68+ macrophages as is described by
Takano et al. [35]. In human renal disease, proximal tubu￾lar induction of HO-1 is found in patients with focal
segmental glomerulosclerosis and rapidly progressing
glomerulonephritis [34]. Also, massive renal upregulation
of HO-1 mRNA is seen after ischemic acute renal failure
in rats [36], as well as in a model of acute renal allograft
rejection [37]. Although the mechanism of HO-1 induc￾tion was not studied here, these data point to defensive
tubular adaptations that are induced in response to the in￾duction of brain death.
In the normal rat kidney, HSP70 protein is found follow￾ing a pattern resembling the corticopapillary concentra￾tion gradient, showing more HSP70 expression in the
hyperosmotic medulla of the kidney compared to the
Figure 4 HO-1 immunohistochemistry staining on renal tissue from living (A,C) and brain dead rats (B,D) showed a significant increase
in HO-1 protein in renal cortical tubules of the 4 h brain dead group (B, 100x) compared to the living group (A 100x). At a
magnification of 400x (C,D) it is apparent that there is an increase in HO-1 protein in a number of singular tubular cells of brain dead rats. Also,
several positive cells can be observed in the glomerulus (D, Arrowheads) which could be CD68+ macrophages.
Figure 5 HSP70 immunohistochemistry staining on renal tissue from living (A) and brain dead rats (B) at 100x magnification shows a
slight increase in staining in the renal cortical tubules of the brain dead rats. (B) Control kidneys showed only occasional positively stained
singular cells in tubular structures.

isosmotic cortex [38]. Enhanced expression of HSP70
was also induced during brain death. However, the
increased expression of HSP70 on protein level was
small as observed by immunohistochemistry, and could
not be reproduced by Western blotting. This could be
the result of the relatively small amount of HSP70 indu￾cing cells. The increase in HSP70 expression was pre￾dominantly noted in animals which were treated with
hydroxyethyl starch for hemodynamic instability during
brain death. Hydroxyethyl starch infusion can cause
renal tubule lesions [39], is an independent risk factor
for acute renal failure during severe sepsis [40] and has
a negative effect on the outcome of renal transplant￾ation if administered to brain dead patients before graft
retrieval [39]. Therefore, we can not be sure if the in￾duction of HSP70 is attributable to effects of brain
death, brain death induced hemodynamic instability, the
infusion of hydroxyethyl starch or any combination of
these factors. However, in other studies, brain death
induced HSP70 mRNA expression in the heart [41] and
kidney [30].
In previous studies HSP27 in the human kidney showed
a weak expression pattern in the cortical collecting ducts,
and strong expression in the medullary collecting ducts.
This pattern, similar to the expression pattern of HSP70,
suggests the influence of the osmotic gradient on the ex￾pression of HSP27 [42]. HSP70, HSP40 and HSP27 are
HSF-1-regulated proteins [43], and the correlations found
between HSP70 and HSP40 protein expressions, and
HSP70 and HSP27 protein expressions indicate that the
increased HSP70 expression measured with RT-PCR and
IHC is HSF-1 mediated. However, brain death induction
did not have any effect on mRNA and protein expression
of HSP40 or HSP27, these unchanged expression patterns
of HSP40 and HSP27 suggest that these proteins are not
upregulated fast enough to be involved in the recuperative
cascade initiated during brain death.
The HSP family of proteins is upregulated in concert
during heat-shock. We therefore investigated expression
of multiple HSPs in our experimental brain death model.
However, only HO-1 and HSP70 were found to be upre￾gulated. The dissociation in induction of HSP in the vari￾ous models suggests that different pathways are involved
in the upregulation of these genes and depend on the ini￾tial stimulus. Yet, the effects of the increase in expression
of HO-1 and HSP70 appear insufficient to counteract the
detrimental effects of brain death to the donor kidney.
The products of heme degradation probably mediate the
protective effects of HO-1. Carbon monoxide, biliverdin
and iron all have various cytoprotective effects in vitro
and in vivo [44]. Part of the protection could be caused by
CO mediated vasodilatation, anti-apoptosis or anti-inflam￾mation. The other products of heme breakdown, iron and
biliverdin, also have cytoprotective properties.
Pharmacological intervention boosting the expression
of HO-1 and other HSPs prior to graft harvest could
therefore be a valuable procedure to increase the per￾formance of kidneys derived from brain dead donors.
The immunoregulatory function of HO-1 has an import￾ant role in cardiac xenograft survival [45]. Induction of
HO-1 during brain death could reduce the inflammatory
processes initiated in the kidney. In fact, upregulation of
HO-1 in brain dead rats using cobalt protoporphyrin
(CoPP) in a model of experimental renal transplantation
improved allograft survival to levels comparable to the
living donor [46]. Interestingly, recent observations have
shown that a longer duration of brain death influences
kidney graft function and survival in a positive way [47].
Kidneys derived from donors that were subjected to a
longer period of brain death showed a significant in￾crease in graft survival, possibly reflecting a renal recu￾perative mechanism that may be mediated by the
delayed induction of HSPs. Further study is needed to
evaluate the role of protective and recuperative pathways
during brain death, and their influence on renal trans￾plant outcome.
Conclusion
Renal stress caused by brain death induces expression of
the cytoprotective genes HO-1 and HSP70, but not of
HSP27 and HSP40. The up-regulation of these cytopro￾tective genes could be part of a recuperative mechanism
induced by stress associated with brain death.
