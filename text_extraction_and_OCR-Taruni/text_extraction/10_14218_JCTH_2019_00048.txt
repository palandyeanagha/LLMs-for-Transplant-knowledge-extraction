Abstract
Annually, 10% of cirrhotic patients with ascites develop
refractory ascites for which large-volume paracentesis (LVP)
is a frequently used therapeutic procedure. LVP, although a
safe method, is associated with circulatory dysfunction in a
significant percentage of patients, which is termed para￾centesis-induced circulatory dysfunction (PICD). PICD results
in faster reaccumulation of ascites, hyponatremia, renal
impairment, and shorter survival. PICD is diagnosed through
laboratory results, with increases of >50% of baseline plasma
renin activity to a value $4 ng/mL/h on the fifth to sixth day
after paracentesis. In this review, we discuss the pathophysi￾ology and prevention of PICD.

Introduction
Ascites is a major complication of liver cirrhosis, with an annual
incidence of 5–10% in compensated cirrhosis.1 Dietary sodium
restriction and oral diuretics are the first treatment choices for
uncomplicated ascites.2,3 Annually, 10% of cirrhotic patients
with ascites develop refractory ascites, which is associated
with a poor prognosis that reduces transplant-free survival to
50% per year.4 In refractory ascites, transjugular intrahepatic
portosystemic shunt (TIPS), increased doses of diuretics, or
large-volume paracentesis (LVP) are the few effective meas￾ures apart from liver transplant in routine practice. Of these,
LVP is the preferred treatment of choice as it is faster, more
effective, and associated with fewer side effects.5 TIPS,4
although effective in a selected group of patients, may be asso￾ciated with ascites recurrence and hepatic encephalopathy. In
addition, its high cost and lack of availability at some places
make it a less desirable option. Therapeutic paracentesis in
patients with cirrhosis and tense ascites leads to circulatory
dysfunction, which is termed paracentesis-induced circulatory
dysfunction or post paracentesis circulatory dysfunction.6,7
PICD usually occurs following LVP (>5–6 L) and results in
faster reaccumulation of ascites, hyponatremia, renal impair￾ment, and shorter survival.7
Epidemiology
The incidence of PICD is estimated to be 80% among patients
not receiving any plasma volume expander, 33% to 38% in
patients receiving polygeline/saline solution/dextran 70, and
11% to 20% among patients receiving albumin.8,9
The definition of PICD
Gines et al.8 first defined PICD as an increase in plasma renin
activity (PRA) on the sixth day after paracentesis of more than
50% of the pretreatment value to a level > 4 ng/ml/h. The
value of 4 ng/mL/h was determined based on 36 healthy vol￾unteers who were on a 50 mmol/day sodium diet for 7 days.
The mean value in healthy volunteers was 1.35 ± 0.94 ng/
mL/h (range, 0.1–4.0). Whether this value of 4 ng/mL/h
holds for patients with cirrhosis and refractory ascites who
have a hyperactive renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is
still unclear. In the same study, 280 cirrhotic patients with
ascites had documented PRA value at baseline. The baseline
value in those who developed PICD (n = 85) was 8.0 ± 7.3
ng/ml/h, which was similar to those who did not (n = 195),
i.e., 9.3 ± 11.5 ng/ml/h. The landmark study by Wilkinson
et al.10 showed that cirrhosis with refractory ascites would
invariably have high PRA due to reduced renal blood flow
with the highest value being 21.77 nmol/L/h and mean
value of 9.5 nmol/L/h, while those with ascites would have
a value double that of the healthy controls (3.99 nmol/L/h
and 1.82 nmol/L/h, respectively). This indicates that the
PRA needs to rise by >50% on day 6 in patients with cirrhosis
and refractory ascites to be called PICD. The diagnosis of
PICD is primarily based on the laboratory value of PRA and
can be diagnosed only after 5 to 6 days of paracentesis.
Although it is a valid objective measure, the difficulties of
measuring PRA due to the technical requirements (blood
sample should be taken after overnight fasting and at least
1 h of bed rest), cost, and questionable benefit in patients
with refractory ascites who undergo repeated paracentesis,
makes it a less favored option for clinicians. The PRA is
dependent on age11,12 (PRA and plasma aldosterone levels

are highest in newborns and lowest in the elderly population),
gender (more in men),12 race (more in whites),12 sodium
intake (increased sodium intake suppresses renin activity),13
diurnal variation (sleep inhibits renin activity),14 posture
(upright posture for 120 m increases renin activity),15 drugs
such as diuretics (chronic treatment with diuretics increases
the PRA),16,17 and beta-blockers (beta-blockers profoundly
suppress renin activity).17 Measuring aldosterone concentra￾tion has no significant role in diagnosing PICD.
Pathophysiology of PICD
LVP causes mechanical decompression of the splanchnic vascu￾lar bed leading to splanchnic vasodilation, a further decrease in
the arterial filling, and activation of neurohormonal systems.
This results in free water and sodium retention. As a conse￾quence, patients develop rapid reaccumulation of ascites, hypo￾natremia, renal injury, and encephalopathy (Fig. 1). Maintaining
the intraabdominal pressure by pneumatic girdle prevents the
circulatory disturbance occurring after paracentesis.18 This was
the argument of peritoneovenous shunt proponents that ascites
will have unidirectional flow from the abdomen into the systemic
circulation leading to the expansion of effective arterial blood
volume, increase in cardiac output, renal blood flow, right atrial
pressure, and atrial natriuretic peptide concentration and
decrease in renin and aldosterone concentrations.19,20 This pro￾cedure has not been widely accepted due to several complica￾tions, including sepsis, coagulopathies, and pulmonary edema,
and is currently extinct.21
The degree of activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldoster￾one system and sympathetic nervous system 6 days after
paracentesis correlates inversely with changes in systemic
vascular resistance (SVR).22 Within 60 m of paracentesis (<5
L), a significant increase in cardiac output, together with a
reduction in mean arterial pressure (MAP), and consequently,
calculated SVR experiences a significant decrease.23 The flow
rate of ascites has no relationship to the development of PICD.24
There is increased cardiac output and PRA and decreased
central venous and wedge pressure 24 h after LVP.25 Whether
edematous or not, all patients undergoing LVP have reduced
creatinine clearance from 77 to 60 mL/m after 48 h.16
Prevention of PICD
Albumin8,26–28 Albumin is an essential plasma protein pro￾duced by hepatocytes. It accounts for 75% of the plasma

colloid oncotic pressure and has a half-life of 15–21 days.
With a molecular weight of 67 kDa and 607 amino acids,
albumin is an asset for physicians. The free cysteine (Cys￾34) residue accounts for the single free redox-active thiol
(-SH) moiety, which accounts for ;80% of extracellular anti￾oxidant properties through nitrosylation, oxidation, and thio￾lation. Patients with ascites usually have hypoalbuminemia.
The causes of hypoalbuminemia are i) reduced hepatic syn￾thesis and secretion, ii) dilution by increased intravascular
and interstitial volume, and iii) loss in the ascitic fluid. The
combination of hypoalbuminemia and impaired albumin func￾tion leads to marked disturbance in the transport, metabo￾lism, and excretion of many endogenous and exogenous
substances. Infusion of exogenous albumin in ascites patients
may serve the dual purpose of replenishing the levels of cir￾culating albumin and the functional activity of the albumin
pool. These are effects specific to albumin not shared by
other plasma volume expanders and may contribute to supe￾rior effectiveness. Albumin is available in preparations of 5%,
20%, and 25% solutions, with a sodium content equivalent to
that of serum. The studies on PICD have involved only 20%
albumin in either 8 g/L of ascitic fluid tapped or 4 g/L of ascitic
fluid removed.
The first study was conducted by Pere Gines,29 who eval￾uated 105 patients with daily paracentesis of 4–6 L until the
disappearance of ascites. Fifty-two patients received
albumin (40 g with each tap), and the other group received
no volume expander. The number of complications (acute
kidney injury [AKI] and hyponatremia) was significantly
higher in patients who had no albumin infusion. However,
the authors reported no mortality benefit with albumin infu￾sion. This landmark study paved the path for further studies
on albumin.
In 1996, Gines et al. compared albumin with dextran 70
and polygeline for the prevention of PICD.8 A total of 289
patients undergoing paracentesis were enrolled, and it was
reported that albumin decreased the incidence of PICD to
18.5% compared to 34.4% in the dextran 70 group and
37.8% in the polygeline group. The mean PRA was 9.2 ±
10.3 ng/ml/h in the albumin arm, 9.5 ± 11.7 in dextran
70, and 8.6 ± 9.8 in the polygeline group, indicating that
the upper limit (i.e., two standard deviations) was about 30 ng/
ml/h in some patients. PICD was associated with a shorter time to
readmission and shorter survival. This was the first randomized
study to demonstrate the superiority of albumin.
A randomized study comparing saline versus albumin in
2003 also showed significant benefits with albumin.30
Seventy-two patients were enrolled (35 in the saline group
and 37 in the albumin group). The baseline heart rate and
MAP in the saline group were 83.1 ± 8.6/m and 81.5 ± 12.2
mmHg and 82.4 ± 10.6/m and 83.1 ± 11.7 mmHg in the
albumin group, respectively. The serum albumin was also
comparable with 2.67 ± 0.48 g/dL in the saline group and
2.56 ± 0.65 g/dL in the albumin group. The baseline PRA
value in the saline group was 5.4 ± 5.4, and in the albumin
group was 5.2 ± 4.5 ng/mL/h. The volume of ascites
removed was comparable in both groups (>6 L) over a
mean duration of ;90 min. The amount of albumin given
was 260 ± 115.1 mL (20% albumin at 8 g/L ascites), and
saline was 1075 ± 365 mL (170 mL of 3.5% saline solution
per L ascites removed at 999 mL/h). There were 10 patients
with complications in the saline group compared to only 6 in
the albumin group. The incidence of PICD (based on PRA
rise) was 33.3% in the saline group and only 11.4% in the
albumin group (p = 0.03). When <6 L was tapped, the inci￾dence of PICD was similar in both groups (6.7% in saline vs.
5.6% in the albumin group; p = 0.9). MAP, hemoglobin, and
potassium levels at baseline were predictors of PICD. The
type of plasma expander was found to have a significant
preventive effect on PICD by both univariate and multivari￾ate analysis. Albumin was a better alternative when >6 L
was tapped.
A pilot study by Richard Moreau et al.,
31 conducted in
2000 (published in 2006) comparing synthetic colloid
(3.5% polygeline) with albumin, concluded that albumin
was more effective in preventing liver-related complications.
The study was prematurely discontinued because of safety
concerns about bovine-derived products. A total of 68
patients were enrolled: 30 in the albumin group and 38 in
the polygeline group. One unit of the study colloid (blinded)
provided either 20 g albumin or 17.5 g polygeline. The
amount transfused was fixed as 1 U if below 4 L, 2U if
between 4 L and below 6 L, 3U if between 6 L and below 8
L, and 4 U if 8 L or more. The patients were followed up for 6
months, and the number of taps and complications due to
liver disease was assessed. The polygeline group had a 1.6-
fold higher risk of developing liver-related complications
than the albumin group.
An open-label randomized study comparing half the dose
of albumin (4 g/L of ascites tapped) with the conventional
dose (8 g/L ascites) concluded that half the dose was
effective and economical for preventing the complications
(PICD) of LVP.32
Terlipressin33 Terlipressin (N-a-triglycyl-8-L-lysine-vas￾opressin) (formula: C52H74N16O15S2) is a vasopressin 1 (V1)
receptor agonist with a molecular weight of 1227.4. It is a
cyclic dodecapeptide that exists as a white freeze-dried fluffy
powder, with a distribution half-life of ;8 m. Terlipressin
plasma concentrations decline exponentially following intra￾venous IV administration, with an elimination half-life of
approximately 1 h and plasma clearance of approximately
9 ml/kg/min. Terlipressin, a prodrug, is cleaved by endopep￾tidases, resulting in slow release of lysine vasopressin, the
active metabolite. Measurable concentrations of vasopressin
appear in the plasma from about 20–30 m post-dose,
peaking at 1–2 h post-dose. Although terlipressin is used in
PICD, its short half-life requires it to be given for prolonged
periods to achieve a sustained MAP rise. Terlipressin
increases systemic vascular resistance, reduces the portal
pressure, and has been used for variceal bleed,34 hepatore￾nal syndrome (HRS),35 septic shock,36,37 and prevention of
PICD.38
A pilot study comparing the efficacy of terlipressin versus
albumin showed that terlipressin is as effective as albumin in
maintaining the arterial volume post paracentesis.38 The
authors randomly allotted 11 patients to terlipressin and 13
to the albumin arm. A total of 3 mg terlipressin was given,
1 mg at the onset of paracentesis, and then 1 mg at 8 h and
16 h. Albumin was given at a dose of 8 g/L ascites removed.
Fifty percent within 2 h and 50% after 6 h of paracentesis.
After completion, only 10 in each arm were included for anal￾ysis. The volume of ascites removed was similar in both
groups. They measured the plasma renin concentrations
(not the PRA). The number of patients (three in each arm)
who had decreased arterial blood volume (based on >50%
decrease in plasma renin concentrations on day 6) did not
differ between the two groups. Only one patient in each
group developed hyponatremia. There were no adverse

events noted in either group. The authors concluded that ter￾lipressin is as efficacious in maintaining the arterial blood
volume post paracentesis by splanchnic vasoconstriction.
Another pilot study of 40 patients comparing terlipressin
with albumin showed that terlipressin is as efficacious as
albumin in the prevention of PICD.39 The baseline PRA was
similar in both the treatment group with 19.15 ± 12.17 ng/
mL/h in the albumin group vs. 20.11 ± 10.60 ng/mL/h in the
terlipressin group. There were no side effects reported in the
study; neither there was any difference in the occurrence of
PICD. There was an insignificant decline in sodium levels 6
days after paracentesis, which was also similar in both
groups. The authors concluded that terlipressin is equivalent
to albumin.
Midodrine40 Midodrine is an a1-agonist whose active
metabolite is desglymidodrine. It acts on the alpha-adrener￾gic receptors of the arteriolar and venous vasculature, pro￾ducing an increase in vascular tone and elevation of blood
pressure. It is rapidly absorbed orally. The bioavailability of
midodrine is similar, whether given intravenously or orally.
Plasma levels of the prodrug peak after about 0.5 h and
decline with a half-life of approximately 25 m. Blood concen￾trations of desglymidodrine peak at 1 to 2 h after a dose of
midodrine and has a half-life of about 3 to 4 h. The absolute
oral bioavailability is 93% and is unaffected by food. Neither
midodrine nor desglymidodrine is bound significantly to
plasma proteins, and 80% of the drug is eliminated via the
renal route by active secretion. An increase in PRA after short￾term noradrenaline infusion (also an alpha-adrenergic
agonist) has been demonstrated in patients with hepatorenal
syndrome, suggesting a vasoconstrictive effect on the renal
artery.41 It is unknown whether midodrine also exerts similar
effects. Midodrine has been used for refractory ascites,42
HRS,35 and prevention of PICD.43
Two small pilot studies done on midodrine had conflicting
results. One pilot study with 40 patients concluded that
midodrine is as effective as albumin.43 Midodrine was
administered at a dose of 5–10 mg (mean 8.62 ± 1.51mg)
three times per day to maintain a MAP at 10mmhg higher
than baseline. Albumin was given at a dose of 8 g/L ascitic
fluid removed (mean 48.4 ± 12.1 g). PRA at baseline and 6
days post paracentesis did not differ among the two groups.
Alcohol was the most common etiology of liver disease in
both groups. Other causes of liver disease were hepatitis B
virus, hepatitis C virus, autoimmune, and idiopathic. Most
interestingly, even with such a high Child’s score (;10),
patients had preserved serum albumin levels of 3.2 ± 0.54
g/dL in the albumin group and 3.17 ± 0.49 g/dL in the mido￾drine group. Two patients had an increase in PRA by >50%
from baseline in the albumin group, but none in the mido￾drine group had significant PRA elevation. None developed
AKI or hyponatremia, although there was a significant
decrease in serum sodium levels on day 6 in both groups.
A significant increase in 24-h urine volume and urine sodium
excretion was observed in the midodrine group. One patient
in the albumin group developed a febrile reaction, and one
patient in the midodrine group developed headaches and
pruritis. Only three patients (two in the albumin group and
one in the midodrine group) required repeat paracentesis
within 3 months of the treatment. This was a randomized
trial with a follow-up of 3 months and also reported
adverse events.
A pilot study by Appenrodt et al.44 evaluating the role of
midodrine in prevention PICD after LVP42 concluded that
midodrine in a fixed short-term dose is ineffective compared
to albumin. A total of 24 patients with 13 in the albumin arm
and 11 in the midodrine arm were included. Midodrine was
given at a dose of 12.5 mg three times a day for 2 days post
paracentesis and albumin at a dose of 8 g per L ascites
removed. The causes of liver cirrhosis in the study were
alcohol, hepatitis (the cause of hepatitis was not mentioned
in the article), and idiopathic. The median volume of ascites
removed was 6.3 L. A total of 4 patients (2 in each arm)
recruited were in Child’s class B, and 20 were Child C cir￾rhotic (11 in the albumin and 9 in the midodrine groups).
PICD developed in six patients in the midodrine group
(60%) and four patients (31%) in the albumin group. None
of the patients in the albumin group developed AKI com￾pared to two in the midodrine arm. Hyponatremia was
noted in seven patients in the albumin group compared to
four in the midodrine group. Plasma renin concentration
increased from 677.5 to 1337.5 mU/mL in the midodrine
arm, whereas in the albumin arm, it increased from 385 to
402 mU/mL on day 6. There were no side effects, even with
37.5 mg midodrine/day.
Noradrenaline45 Noradrenaline is the principal neuro￾transmitter of the sympathetic nervous system produced by
the adrenal medulla. Noradrenaline is preferred over adrena￾line in shock as it causes global vasoconstriction, while adre￾naline leads to venoconstriction and promotes venous return
to the heart. Noradrenaline is a potent alpha agonist.
Although noradrenaline is an economical choice, its benefits
in the prevention of PICD are not well known. As the duration
of action is only 1–2 m, it needs to be given by slow infusion.
Noradrenaline infusion can cause severe peripheral and vis￾ceral vasoconstriction leading to a decrease in renal blood
flow by 20% and cerebral blood flow by 10% without affecting
the skeletal muscle and liver blood flow.46 Post paracentesis,
cirrhotics develop hypovolemia, and the systemic effects can
be worsened by noradrenaline infusion. Moreover, cirrhotics
with ascites have higher levels of norepinephrine, but the
receptors are desensitized; hence, norepinephrine infusion
is less effective in cirrhotics.47 Norepinephrine has been
used in shock,37 HRS,48 and PICD.49
A small pilot study comparing noradrenaline with albumin
reported that noradrenaline is an economical and efficacious
choice over albumin.49 Noradrenaline was started in a contin￾uous infusion at an initial dose of 0.5 mg/h with a maximum
dose given up to 3 mg/h. The infusion rate was titrated in
steps of 0.125 mg/h to maintain the MAP at 10 mmHg
above the baseline. The MAP was maintained at that level
for the next 72 h with close monitoring. Effective arterial
blood volume, as indicated by PRA before and 6 days after
paracentesis, did not differ in the two groups (mean ;20
ng/mL/h). All patients underwent LVP. Two patients in the
noradrenaline group and one in the albumin group had a
rise in PRA by >50% on the sixth day. None of the patients
developed renal impairment or hyponatremia. Only one
patient receiving noradrenaline complained of restlessness.
Further, one patient in each arm developed spontaneous bac￾terial peritonitis (SBP) on follow-up.
Contraindications to LVP: LVP leads to an accentuation of
the arteriolar vasodilation, which is already present in cir￾rhotic patients with ascites. Therefore, LVP should be deferred
in patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP),
hepatorenal syndrome, and variceal bleed.

Combination therapies
A large trial of 150 patients (presented as an abstract at a
major conference) on combination therapy of vasoconstric￾tor and albumin showed a significant decrease in the number
of complications in patients receiving midodrine with
albumin.50 The benefit was lacking when terlipressin was
used with albumin. However, terlipressin was given for only
1 day, whereas midodrine was given for 3 days. Complica￾tions such as pain abdomen, headache, and bradycardia
were common in the terlipressin arm and whereas patients
receiving midodrine experienced urinary retention, head￾ache, hypertension, and anxiety. The combination therapy
should be further explored for the prevention and treatment
of PICD.
Meta-analysis
A meta-analysis by Bernardi et al. in 2012, which compared
albumin with other therapies such as colloids or vasocon￾strictors, showed that albumin remains the best choice for
patients undergoing LVP.9 Seventeen randomized controlled
trials, reported from 1988 to 2010 with a total of 1,225
patients, met all selection criteria and were included
(Table 1). The mean age of the study population ranged
from 46.9 to 61.4 years. Seventy-four percent were males
(range, 60.0-90.0%) with mean baseline serum albumin
ranging from 26 to 29 g/L, and the mean Child-Pugh score
ranged from 8.8 to 11.0. The mean volume of ascitic fluid
removed ranged from 5.5 to 15.9 L. The dose of albumin
varied from 5–10 g/L of fluid tapped. The vasoconstrictors
were terlipressin, midodrine, and noradrenaline. Compared
to no treatment, albumin reduced the odds of PICD by 93%,
61% when compared to another volume expander, and 30%
when compared to a vasoconstrictor. Compared to untreated
control patients in whom 16.5% developed hyponatremia,
only ;4% developed hyponatremia in the albumin group.
In total, albumin reduced the odds of developing PICD by
66%, hyponatremia by 42%, and death by 36%.
Another meta-analysis51 that included 16 trials on
albumin concluded that albumin use significantly reduced
the risk of paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction,
but there was a nonsignificant difference in complications
and mortality. The authors also noted that there was a sig￾nificant reduction in mortality and renal impairment when
albumin was used in cirrhosis with infection.
A recent Cochrane review,52 which included 27 random￾ized trials, concluded that there was neither any benefit nor
any adverse effect in using any plasma expander, including
albumin, polygeline, dextrans, hydroxyethyl starch, intra￾venous infusion of ascitic fluid, and crystalloids in patients
undergoing paracentesis. The data on albumin/volume
expanders originated from a few, small, short-term trials
that were at high risk of systemic errors, selection bias,
and random errors. They also suggested that more exten￾sive trials with adherence to CONSORT and SPIRIT guide￾lines are required to assess the role of plasma expanders,
including albumin, in paracentesis. The review did not con￾sider trials comparing vasoconstrictors with volume
expanders. The advantages and disadvantages of the
drugs that have been used for PICD prevention are shown
in Table 2.

patients in the meta-analysis, compared
with 13% each for trials with no

Albumin remains superior to other

Differential diagnosis
The complications of PICD are usually attributed to cirrhosis
of the liver and are thought to be a complication of the disease
(cirrhosis). The usual differentials, which are considered in
practice while missing the history of LVP, are shown in Table 3.
Treatment of PICD
Volume expansion with albumin infusion is the mainstay of
treatment. The use of vasoconstrictors can also help in
treatment but needs to be evaluated. However, avoiding
paracentesis and withholding diuretics/beta-blockers during
PICD prevents the worsening of hemodynamics and
encephalopathy.
Conclusions
PICD is a dreaded complication of paracentesis and is
associated with a high incidence of morbidity and mortality.
It is often overlooked and is a commonly missed diagnosis.
The differentials in any patient presenting with worsening of
complications of cirrhosis should include PICD. The diagnosis
is clinical, and the measurement of PRA may or may not aid in
diagnosis. PICD should be redefined as any complication
(kidney injury, hyponatremia, encephalopathy, variceal
bleed) developing after paracentesis with or without a con￾current rise in PRA.
Way forward
More extensive randomized trials involving a larger sample
size on the prevention of PICD with vasoconstrictors (with or
without volume expanders) with clinical endpoints other than
laboratory-based are suggested.
