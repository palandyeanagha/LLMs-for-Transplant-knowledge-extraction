Abstract
The genetic basis of hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) remains unknown, and the lack of animal models to
reconstitute the cardiac maldevelopment has hampered the study of this disease. This study investigated the altered control
of transcriptional and epigenetic programs that may affect the development of HLHS by using disease-specific induced
pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. Cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) were isolated from patients with congenital heart diseases to
generate patient-specific iPS cells. Comparative gene expression analysis of HLHS- and biventricle (BV) heart-derived iPS
cells was performed to dissect the complex genetic circuits that may promote the disease phenotype. Both HLHS- and BV
heart-derived CPCs were reprogrammed to generate disease-specific iPS cells, which showed characteristic human
embryonic stem cell signatures, expressed pluripotency markers, and could give rise to cardiomyocytes. However, HLHS-iPS
cells exhibited lower cardiomyogenic differentiation potential than BV-iPS cells. Quantitative gene expression analysis
demonstrated that HLHS-derived iPS cells showed transcriptional repression of NKX2-5, reduced levels of TBX2 and NOTCH/
HEY signaling, and inhibited HAND1/2 transcripts compared with control cells. Although both HLHS-derived CPCs and iPS
cells showed reduced SRE and TNNT2 transcriptional activation compared with BV-derived cells, co-transfection of NKX2-5,
HAND1, and NOTCH1 into HLHS-derived cells resulted in synergistic restoration of these promoters activation. Notably,
gain- and loss-of-function studies revealed that NKX2-5 had a predominant impact on NPPA transcriptional activation.
Moreover, differentiated HLHS-derived iPS cells showed reduced H3K4 dimethylation as well as histone H3 acetylation but
increased H3K27 trimethylation to inhibit transcriptional activation on the NKX2-5 promoter. These findings suggest that
patient-specific iPS cells may provide molecular insights into complex transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms, at least in
part, through combinatorial expression of NKX2-5, HAND1, and NOTCH1 that coordinately contribute to cardiac
malformations in HLHS.

Introduction
Single ventricle (SV) physiology including hypoplastic left heart
syndrome (HLHS) is characterized by obstruction of the left
ventricle (LV) in association with absence or underdevelopment of
the left ventricular chamber morphogenesis that is not capable of
supporting systemic cardiac output. Infants with SV physiology
theoretically undergo two major medical treatments: cardiac
transplantation and three-stage palliative reconstruction [1,2].
However, their long-term survival has been shown to be
remarkably lower than that of patients with all other congenital
heart diseases [3].
Embryonic development in the heart is controlled by a core set
of essential cardiac transcription factors that regulate progenitor
cell migration and expansion, morphogenesis of cardiac chambers,
and maturation of structural proteins. Genetically, HLHS has
been associated with chromosome anomalies, but no single genetic
basis has been found to be specifically linked to this syndrome [4].
Although the majority of cases are sporadic, rare patients who
inherited multiple gene variants suggest that HLHS may be

pathophysiologically heterogeneous and caused by cumulative
effects that are poorly understood [5].
Obviously, most of the disease-causing genes for HLHS remain
to be identified; however, the rarity of kindred with familial
recurrences of HLHS with viable penetrance and phenotype has
made linkage studies difficult. Patient-derived cardiac progenitor
cells (CPCs) may allow researchers to investigate early cardiac
development programs that have already acquired the disease
phenotypes. A simultaneous tractable system, reported here, may
facilitate the identification of crucial determinants in HLHS by
modeling the disease with reprogramming technology that enables
comprehensive analysis of patient-specific genetic disorders prior
to disease onset.
iPS cells, which closely resemble embryonic stem (ES) cells, can
be derived from human somatic tissues from a variety of diseases
to recapitulate complex physiological phenotypes. Patient-specific
iPS cells may provide an additional tool for studying human heart
disease [6]. Here, to identify the key elements responsible for
hypoplasia of left heart development, we generated disease-specific
iPS cells in patients with congenital heart malformation, identified
unique genes differentially expressed in HLHS, and explored the
responsible regulatory network involved in myocardial patterning
and morphogenesis during cardiac development with respect to
LV hypoplasia in humans.
Materials and Methods
Ethics Statement
Written informed consent was obtained from the parents of the
patients before the collection of tissue samples. The study protocols
using human tissue samples and animals were approved by the
Research Ethics Committee of Okayama University. As control
RNA of human embryonic stem cells, khESC-1-derived RNA was
isolated and provided by Keio University as previously reported
[7].
Tissue Sample and Cell Culture
Myocardial tissues were obtained from right atria during open￾heart surgery shortly after cardiopulmonary bypass. Cardiac
specimens were digested using 0.4% type II collagenase and
0.01% DNAse and minced to produce a single-cell suspension.
The cells were seeded at 20 cells/ml in ultra-low culture dishes to
generate cardiospheres with growth medium containing DMEM/
F12 (Invitrogen), 10% fetal bovine serum, 20 ng/ml recombinant
human epidermal growth factor (EGF; Wako), 40 ng/ml recom￾binant human basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF; Wako), 50 U/
ml penicillin, and 50 mg/ml streptomycin as previously described
[8,9]. Cardiospheres were mechanically harvested, digested, and
cultured on poly-D-lysine-coated dishes to obtain CPCs.
Generation and Differentiation of Patient-Specific iPS
Cells
For iPS cell generation, CPCs were infected with concentrated
retroviruses pseudotyped with vesicular stomatitis virus surface
protein (VSV-G; Cell Biolabs, Inc.) encoding the human
transcription factors OCT4, KLF4, SOX2, and MYC (Addgene)
as previously described [10]. Transfected CPCs were maintained
on mouse SNL feeders for 7 days post-infection and then cultured
in DMEM/F12 containing 20% Knockout Serum Replacement,
2 mM L-glutamine, 0.1 mM nonessential amino acid (NEAA),
0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME), 50 U/mL penicillin, 50 mg/
ml streptomycin (all from Invitrogen), and 4 ng/mL recombinant
human bFGF until iPS colonies appeared. Control human iPS
cells (201B7; HPS0063) were purchased from RIKEN Bioresource
Center.
Cardiac differentiation was induced on Matrigel-coated culture
dishes in feeder-free conditions. The medium was replaced with
serum-free medium (RPMI1640, Invitrogen) containing B27
(RPMI/B27, Invitrogen) and supplemented with 100 ng/ml
human recombinant activin A for 24 h, followed by incubation
with 10 ng/ml human recombinant bone morphogenetic protein
(BMP) 4 for an additional 4 days (all from R&D Systems).
Immunofluorescence
Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min and
stained in blocking buffer with primary antibodies against
NANOG (R&D Systems), SSEA-3 (BD Biosciences), OCT4,
SSEA-4, TRA-1-60, and TRA-1-81 (all from Millipore), followed
by incubation with Alexa Fluor 488/546/594 secondary antibod￾ies (Molecular Probes). To evaluate cardiomyocyte differentiation,
fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 30 min
and incubated with primary antibodies directed against cardiac
troponin-T (Abcam). Cells were counterstained with DAPI
(Molecular Probes) and visualized using a confocal laser scanning
microscope (FV-1000, Olympus, Tokyo). Alkaline phosphatase
staining was performed using Alkaline Phosphatase Detection kit
(Millipore) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Bisulfite Sequencing and Karyotype Analysis
Genomic DNA (1 mg) was extracted (QIAGEN) from patient￾derived undifferentiated CPCs or iPS cells and processed for
bisulfite conversion by using a Methylamp DNA modification kit
(Epigentek). The promoter regions of OCT4 and NANOG were
then amplified by PCR using primers as previously described
(Table S2 in File S1) [11]. The PCR products were subcloned into
pCRII-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and analyzed using ABI 3700
DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Chromosomal analysis was
performed using the standard G-banding chromosome detection
method (SRL).
Teratoma Formation
Disease-specific iPS cells (0.6–16106 cells) were directly injected
into the testes of NOD/SCID mice. At 10 to 12 weeks after
transplantation, teratomas were dissected and processed for
paraffin embedding and hematoxylin and eosin staining.
Real-Time RT-PCR and Global Gene Expression Analysis
Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invtrogen) and
cDNA was synthesized using Reverse Transcription Kit (QIA￾GEN). Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using FastStart
Universal Probe Master (Roche) analyzed with the 7300 real-time
PCR system (Applied Biosystems) and primers. All experiments
were conducted more than five times with three different clonal
derivatives. PCR was carried out using Ex Taq (Takara). All data
were normalized using b2-microglobulin (B2M) and human heart
tissue for comparisons. Primer sequences are shown in Table S2
in File S1. To assess the transcriptional profile, cyanine-labeled
antisense RNA was amplified and hybridized with a Whole
Human Genome Microarray (Agilent). Data were analyzed using
GeneSpring GX10.0 software and gene expression levels were
normalized using Robust Multi-array Average algorithm.
ChIP Assay
The experiments of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
were performed using ChIP-IT Express Enzymatic Magnetic
Chromatin Immunoprecipitation kit (Active Motif). Briefly, 16106

CPCs, undifferentiated iPS cells, and differentiated iPS cells were
cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde solution for 5 min at room
temperature. The cells were harvested and nuclei were extracted,
lysed, and enzymatically sheared to obtain chromatin. Immuno￾precipitation was performed on an end-to-end rotation overnight
at 4uC using the following antibodies: IgG (Upstate, Millipore 12-
370), H3K4me2 (Upstate, Millipore 07-030), H3K27me3 (Up￾state, Millipore 07-449), and acH3 (Upstate, Millipore 06-599).
Crosslinking between DNA and proteins was reversed. DNA was
purified after proteinase K digestion using Chromatin IP DNA
Purification Kit (Active Motif). All precipitated DNA samples were
amplified and quantitated by real-time PCR with SYBR Premix
Ex Taq II (TaKaRa) and NKX2-5 ChIP primers (Table S2 in File
S1). Signals corresponding to each antibody were normalized by
respective input.
Promoter Assays
The TNNT2 (HPRM12846-PG04) and NPPA (natriuretic
peptide A; HPRM23486-PG04) promoter activities were mea￾sured using a Dual Luminescence Assay Kit with a dual reporter
construct containing Gaussia luciferase (GLuc) and secreted
alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) side by side from a single sample
(all from GeneCopoeia, Inc.). Each promoter is placed upstream of
the GLuc reporter gene and contains a specific cardiac transcrip￾tion factor as an insert. A secondary reporter gene SEAP was used
to monitor the transfection efficiency for normalization. To detect
serum response element (SRE) promoter activities, both SRE
fragment (pGL4.33 [luc2P/SRE/Hygro], Promega) and pGL4.74
(hRluc/TK, Promega) were co-transfected into human cells by
using X-tremeGene HP reagent (Roche). The relative expression
of SRE (luc2P) construct was normalized using a control vector
(hRluc) introduced into the same cells. Human cells were
transfected with human NKX2-5 cDNA (SC122678), human
NKX2-5 shRNA (short hairpin RNA; TR311165B), human

Results
Generation of Disease-Specific iPS Cells Using
Patient-Derived CPCs
CPCs were isolated from the right atria of patients with
congenital heart diseases undergoing cardiac surgery (Figure 1A).
Individual cardiosphere-derived CPCs were isolated and infected
with a combination of retroviruses encoding the transcription
factors OCT4, KLF4, SOX2, and MYC as previously reported
(Figure 1B) [11]. Among the iPS clones generated, five HLHS-iPS
clones (iPS30, iPS46, iPS59, iPS68, and iPS72) and one BV-iPS
clone (iPS65), obtained from a total anomalous pulmonary venous
connection (TAPVC) patient, could propagate robustly when
maintained on SNL feeder cells. We then used the iPS clones
(iPS30-, iPS46-, and iPS72-HLHS) and the iPS65 clone (iPS-BV)
for further evaluation in this study. Genomic integration of viral
transgene was confirmed by RT-PCR. The reactivation of
endogenous genes OCT4 and NANOG led to higher levels in
patient-specific iPS cells than in parental CPCs (Figure 1C). We
also examined the expression of viral transgenes; RT-PCR showed
that four factors (transgenes) were efficiently silenced in the
established iPS cell lines; they were maintained for more than 15
passages and examined at 3 months post-infection (Figure 1D).
Characterization of Patient-Derived iPS Cells
The two types of disease-specific iPS cell grew at similar rates
and uniformly expressed stringent pluripotent markers such as
Figure 3. Patient-specific CPCs were fully reprogrammed. (A) Representative images of alkaline phosphatase staining are shown for iPS cells

OCT4, SSEA-3, SSEA-4, TRA-1-60, TRA-1-81, and NANOG,
as determined by immunofluorescence (Figures 2A and B). We
next sought to confirm the epigenetic reprogramming in individual
iPS cells. Bisulfite sequencing analysis was performed to verify the
degree of DNA methylation of the OCT4 and NANOG promoters
(Figures 2C and D). CpG dinucleotides in both promoter regions
were highly demethylated in both patient-derived iPS cells relative
to parental CPCs. Consistent with their ES-like morphology, both
HLHS- and BV-derived iPS cells were positive for alkaline
phosphatase staining (Figure 3A) and could maintain a normal
karyotype for at least 10 weeks (Figure 3B).
Molecular Signatures of Patient-Derived CPCs and iPS
Cells
We next performed global gene expression analysis on patient￾specific iPS cells and parental CPCs using oligonucleotide
microarray (Figure 3C). The heat map image showed that the
expression profiles of both iPS cells were similar to those in control
human iPS cells (clone 201B7) and human embryonic stem cells
(clone khESC-1), but different from that in parental CPCs.
Consistent with this, hierarchical clustering analysis demonstrated
that disease-specific iPS cells closely resembled control human iPS
cells, but were distinct from parental CPCs. Of particular note,
pluripotency-associated genes represented by NANOG, POU5F1
(OCT4), and TDGF1 were expressed at remarkable levels in iPS
cells compared with the levels in parental CPCs analyzed using
three-independent CPC lines (Table S1 in File S1). Patient-derived
CPCs significantly expressed typical gene transcripts indispensable
for progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation, including
IL1B, GREM1, LIF, TGFBR2, and IFGBP7 [12–15], and also
showed a vascular-lineage-committed phenotype by expressing
EDN1, LMO2, and VEGFC (Table S1 in File S1).
To assess the in vivo pluripotency, iPS cells generated from
patients were injected into NOD/SCID mice. Ten to twelve weeks
after transplantation, both iPS cells gave rise to teratomas
originating from all three embryonic layers, including gut-like
epithelia (endoderm), cartilage and adipose tissue (mesoderm), and
neuroectodermal tissue (ectoderm) (Figure 4).
Cardiomyocyte Differentiation Potential of
Disease-Specific iPS Cells
Upon cardiac differentiation, both HLHS- and BV-derived iPS
cells generated cells that expressed typical cardiac structural
proteins, cardiac troponin-T (TNNT2) verified by immunostain￾ing, suggesting that HLHS-derived iPS cells are capable of
generating cardiomyocytes in vitro (Figure 5A). Quantitative RT￾PCR revealed that TNNT2 expression was significantly upregu￾lated at 3 weeks after differentiation compared with that at
baseline in both types of iPS-derived cardiomyocyte; however,
HLHS-derived iPS cells showed reduced cardiomyogenic potential
than those from control and BV heart (Fig. 5B).
Reduced Transcriptional Regulatory Programs During
Cardiac Differentiation in HLHS-Derived iPS Cells
To determine whether HLHS-derived iPS cells have a distinct
cardiac differentiation program, quantitative RT-PCR was
performed. We found that cardiac transcriptional factors such as
NKX2-5 and HAND1, known to drive cardiac growth and
morphogenesis through primary heart field development, were
significantly downregulated in HLHS-derived iPS cells at 2 to 3
weeks after differentiation compared with their levels in control
201B7 iPS- and BV-iPS-derived cardiomyocytes (Fig. 6) [16].
HAND2 gene expression, which is known to preferentially control
right heart morphogenesis but has a partially cumulative role with
HAND1 in ventricular chamber formation, was also suppressed
[17]. T-box transcription factor TBX2, a particularly important
regulator for outflow tract cushion development and atrioventric￾ular canal formation as myocardial patterning, was significantly
reduced in differentiated HLHS-derived iPS cells [18]. In
addition, reduced expression of NOTCH/HEY signaling was
found. The decreased transcripts of these genes may be associated
with obstruction in the inflow and outflow tracts seen in patients
with HLHS due to the developmental defects in the regions of
atrioventricular and outflow tract myocardium [19]. These data
suggest that HLHS-derived iPS cells have the ability to give rise to
cardiomyocytes; however, these cells had suppressed levels of
indispensable genes involved in progenitor cell expansion and
differentiation to initiate cardiogenesis, atrioventricular canal
formation, and left ventricular outflow tract development to
achieve functional ventricular growth.
NKX2-5, HAND1, and NOTCH1 Are Indispensable to
Restore the Activation of Cardiac-Specific Promoters in
HLHS-Derived Cells
Next, we sought to determine whether NKX2-5, HAND1, and
NOTCH1 genes might be involved in the control of cardiac￾specific promoter activities during the development of HLHS.
Three possible targets of cardiac-related promoters, namely, SRE,
TNNT2, and NPPA, were examined. To demonstrate that the
generated shRNAs were specific for NKX2-5, HAND1, and
NOTCH1, we performed transient transfection experiments to
verify the inhibitory effects of respective gene expressions (Figure
S1 in File S1). Four sets of shRNA for each gene were generated
and transfected into HLHS-derived CPCs with either the full￾length cDNA of interest or combined corresponding shRNA and
cultured for 48 hours. Real-time RT-PCR analyses were per￾formed to determine the appropriate ones for subsequent
experiments. The inhibitory effects of selected shRNAs were
confirmed by using additional clones of HLHS- and BV-derived
CPCs (Figure S1 in File S1).
To investigate whether NKX2-5, HAND1, and NOTCH1
might be the crucial transcriptional activators during cardiomy￾ocyte differentiation, we performed co-transfection studies using
the luciferase reporters driven by SRE, TNNT2, and NPPA
promoters, respectively. As shown in Figures 7A and B, both
HLHS-derived CPCs and iPS cells demonstrated a significant
decrease in SRE transcriptional activation that was synergistically
increased when NKX2-5, HAND1, and NOTCH1 were co￾transfected into the cells, which was equivalent to the level in BV￾derived cells without exogenous gene induction. To address
whether these transcriptional factors are capable of suppressing
endogenous SRE activation, we transfected shRNAs into BV￾derived CPCs and found that either single shRNA or combina￾Figure 6. HLHS-iPS cell-derived cardiomyocytes showed decreased cardiac transcripts. mRNA expressions in control 201B7 iPS cells and

human heart tissue for comparisons. *, p,0.05 vs. differentiated 201B7 and BV-derived iPS cells at corresponding time points. {, p,0.05 vs. 201B7 at

torial treatment had the potential to suppress SRE promoter
activities (Figure 7G). We therefore hypothesized that these
transcriptional factors may also participate in cardiomyocyte
maturation. A TNNT2 promoter-driven luciferase reporter was
used in patient-derived CPCs and iPS cells with or without
exogenous gene transfection. We found that BV-derived CPCs
and iPS cells showed prominent TNNT2 promoter activity
compared with those in two independent HLHS-derived cells
(Figures 7C and D). Induction of NKX2-5, HAND1, and
NOTCH1 synergistically restored the reduced TNNT2 transcrip￾tional activation in both HLHS-derived CPCs and iPS cells. Loss￾of-function studies using shRNAs showed that combinatorial
inhibition of three genes, except for shHAND1 alone, could
markedly suppress the TNNT2 promoter activities (Figure 7H).
NPPA promoter-driven luciferase assays demonstrated a striking
finding that either NKX2-5 alone or combinatorial gene
transfection containing NKX2-5 could fully restore the NPPA
transcriptional activation in both HLHS-derived cell types
(Figures 7E and F). This great impact of NKX2-5 on the NPPA
promoter was confirmed by shRNA experiments that demonstrat￾ed that inhibition of NKX2-5 alone resulted in significant
reduction of NPPA transcriptional activation in BV-derived CPCs
(Figure 7I).
Histone Modification on NKX2-5 Promoter in
HLHS-Derived iPS cells
To investigate further whether epigenetic modifications, such as
histone H3 methylation and acetylation, could be involved in
transcriptional regulation in HLHS-derived iPS cells during
cardiac-lineage induction, ChIP assay was performed using CPCs,
undifferentiated iPS cells, and differentiated iPS cells. Although
there were no differences in methylation or acetylation modifica￾tion at histone H3 in CPCs and undifferentiated iPS cells derived
from HLHS and BV patients, a marked decrease in dimethylated
histone H3-lysine 4 (H3K4me2) and acetylated histone H3 (acH3)
was found within the NKX2-5 promoter regions in differentiated
HLHS-derived iPS cells compared with those from a BV patient.
We also identified significantly increased trimethylated H3-lysine
27 (H3K27me3) in the differentiated HLHS-derived iPS cells
(Figure 8).
Discussion
Congenital heart disease involves abnormalities in cardiac
structure or function that arise before birth. Although a number of
studies have uncovered that heterozygous mutations in cardiac
regulatory genes caused congenital heart defects in humans, the
identified genetic variants may not be directly correlated with
biological insights that potentially contribute to disease develop￾ment [20]. In lower vertebrates, the key regulatory mechanisms
involved in early heart morphogenesis have been investigated
extensively, but our understanding of the causal genes responsible
for the development of such complex disease is still limited in
humans [16]. Recent progress in stem cell biology has revealed a
previously unappreciated aspect of cardiac morphogenesis that is
genetically controlled by a series of lineage-restriction steps of
common progenitor cells that arise from the primary cardiac
crescent during development [21]. In this study, we employed an
integrated approach by using patient-derived iPS cells to study the
pathogenesis of HLHS in order to uncover the molecular
fingerprints that may control progenitor cell fate during early
cardiac development.
Endogenous CPCs from adult mammalian heart were identified
a decade ago [22,23]. Although human CPCs can also be used in
cell culture to dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying
congenital heart defects, investigation of inductive signals associ￾ated with early cardiogenesis by using postnatal cells, obtained
after the onset of the disease of interest, may not be appropriate for
the definitive identification of genes responsible for early
developmental defects. In addition, it may not be possible to
recapitulate the phenotypes by CPCs as in vitro sources because
the pathogenesis of these complex diseases may require multiple
cell types to initiate disease development. Reprogramming
technology may facilitate disease investigation by assessing a wide
variety of pluripotent stem cell differentiation pathways, including
cardiomyogenic commitment, rather than by tracking the lineage￾restricted progenitor cell fate. In this regard, patient-specific iPS
cells may represent a promising cell source to study disease
mechanisms.
There are several limitations in this study. The generation of
patient-derived iPS cells remains technically demanding and
clonal variation within patients or clones from other patients
could be seen among studies; as such, their pathogenetic
heterogeneity should not be ruled out. The lack of patients and
control samples needs to be further emphasized and acknowledged
could be a major limitation in this study. Whether the in vitro
observations at 3 weeks after iPS cell differentiation could be used
as a compatible model of embryonic heart development in humans
remain unclear, so the obtained results may need to be interpreted
with caution. Ethical concerns have limited the use of human
CPCs isolated from healthy individuals due to the safety issues that
must be considered during cardiac biopsy procedures. Our
approach of using myocardial tissue specimens obtained during
cardiac surgery in children was absolutely safe without any
appearance of defects compared with the common skin biopsy
procedures. With respect to a control, 201B7 iPS cells were used
for comparative analysis in this study. We have also isolated
disease-derived CPCs from a TAPVC patient in whom the
pulmonary veins fail to enter the left atrium but supply the blood
flow into the right atrium. Besides the malpositioned pulmonary
vessels in this case, four-chamber morphogenesis and outflow tract
developed normally in the presence of patent foramen ovale to
support oxygenation.
In this study, we found a series of transcriptional repression
during the directed differentiation of HLHS-derived iPS cells,
which are implicated in the development of HLHS (Figure 9A)
and mutually controlled by a core-transcriptional regulatory
network, including NKX2-5 and HAND [16]. These results are
consistent with a previous mouse study demonstrating that the
Nkx2-5-Hand1 transcriptional pathway plays an essential role in

Figure 9. Orchestrated gene regulatory network in the development of HLHS. (A) Core transcriptional factors expressed in cardiac
progenitor cells serve as targets in response to inductive signals to initiate cardiogenesis. NKX2-5 is predominantly expressed in the primary heart
field and controls progenitor cell proliferation. Genes regulate atrioventricular (AV) canal and valve development. Reduced expression may contribute
to mitral- and aortic-valve stenosis/atresia often seen in HLHS. NOCTH modulates left heart outflow tract development and the resultant obstruction
may cause secondary ventricle hypoplasia. HAND1/2 specify left and right ventricular chamber morphogenesis, and the absence of these genes may
lead to a hypoplastic ventricle. (B–D) Schematic diagrams of SRE, TNNT2, and NPPA transcriptional activation. HLHS-derived CPCs and iPS cells showed

left ventricular formation during cardiogenesis [24]. Of particular
note, potential NKX2-5 mutations were found in patients with
HLHS [25,26] and a frameshift mutation in HAND1 was reported
[27]. The epigenetic signature of NKX2-5 transcripts in iPS cells
during differentiation is unknown [28]. In general, undifferenti￾ated stem cells show hypomethylation of specific gene promoters
to allow their rapid activation during the processes of differenti￾ation. Methylation at H3K4 is associated with transcriptional
activation, whereas H3K27me3 represents a suppressive mark of
condensed chromatin status. The results of ChIP assay suggest that
reduced H3K4me2 and increased H3K27me3 on the NKX2-5
promoter might be the alternative epigenetic mechanism to
interpret the impaired transcriptional expression found in the
differentiation processes of HLHS-derived iPS cells.
The atrioventricular canal is located between atrial and
ventricular chamber regions and is an essential source to complete
endocardial cushion and valve development. Decreased inflow
dynamics may lead to mitral stenosis/atresia as seen in HLHS.
Although we did not observe significant changes in BOP1, which
is a signaling control of secondary heart field development,
combinatorial contributions by the NOTCH/HEY and TBX2
axes from both heart fields might specify this process in HLHS
(Figure 9A) [18,29,30].
HLHS generally involves a predisposition to obstructed left
ventricular outflow, which is commonly associated with aortic
atresia [31]. The pathogenesis of HLHS may originate as a
primary defect in valve development that leads to secondary LV
hypoplasia (Figure 9A). NOTCH1 mutations have been identified
in HLHS individuals and aortic valve anomalies [32,33]. Recent
study related to NOTCH1 mutations in humans suggests a direct
function of activated NOTCH and NOTCH ligand JAGGED
complex in controlling myocardial growth through NKX2-5
activation [34,35]. The most prominent NOTCH effectors are
basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors, HEY1/2. Endocardial
NOTCH/HEY signal integration during endocardial to mesen￾chymal transition has been shown to be critical in the generation
of cardiac valve as a specialized structure [36]. Finally, HAND1
and HAND2 are preferentially expressed in primary and
secondary heart fields to develop left and right chamber
morphogenesis [37,38]. Although the role of Hand2 is generally
essential in the secondary heart field [39], it was reported that the
decreased expression of Hand2 in mice could influence formation
of the LV and the aortic arch system [24], suggesting some
implications in the phenotype of HLHS.
In this study, HLHS-derived iPS cells demonstrated lower
capability of differentiating into cardiomyocytes (Figure 5B), which
is consistent with a recent report showing that iPS cells generated
from HLHS patients had impaired sarcomeric organization as well
as altered calcium transient patterning and responses to b￾adrenergic antagonist during differentiation when compared with
control iPS and human ES cells [40]. These observations indicate
that HLHS-derived cells may have critical defects of transcrip￾tional activation that are required for cardiac differentiation and
organ morphogenesis of the heart. Among the genes analyzed in
this study, NKX2-5, HAND1, and NOTCH1 were identified to be
the essential transcripts to activate a subset of cardiac lineage￾specific gene transcription. In contrast, the transcripts of GATA4
and TBX5 have been shown to be cooperatively involved in
directing early cardiac transcriptional activation in vitro and in
vivo; indeed, we only observed comparable expression of these
genes between HLHS- and BV-derived cells during cardiac
differentiation (data not shown) [41,42]. Novel insights have come
from the gain- and loss-of-function experiments that demonstrated
that these three transcription factors synergistically regulated SRE,
TNNT2, and NPPA transcriptional activation (Figure 9B–D).
Although the chromatin states of tissue-specific stem cells have
been shown to be intermediate between pluripotent and differen￾tiated cells [43], we found that HLHS-iPS-derived cardiomyocytes
but not undifferentiated CPCs failed to acquire active histone
marks at the NKX2-5 promoter region to achieve full cardiac￾lineage induction compared with BV-derived iPS cells (Figure 9E).
These results suggest that epigenetic pre-patterning during
development may also contribute to reduced cardiac-lineage
specification and impaired heart morphogenesis in HLHS.
In conclusion, patient-derived CPCs can be efficiently repro￾grammed into disease-specific iPS cells for modeling congenital
heart malformations. This integrated technology offers an
unprecedented opportunity to reveal the genes differentially
expressed between iPS cells with and without ventricular chamber
defects and might enable correction of the gene variants for
therapeutic purposes in HLHS. With knowledge of early cardiac
development, the molecular regulatory networks that mediate
myocardial growth and morphogenesis can be more informatively
dissected by using patient-derived iPS cells.

NOTCH1, proposed core transcriptional factors, could synergistically restore the transcriptional activation in these reporters equivalent to the levels in
BV-derived cells. (E) Major chromatin features in differentiated HLHS- and BV-derived iPS cells are shown. Upon cardiomyocyte differentiation, HLHS￾derived iPS cells failed to enrich the active histone marks such as H3K4me2 and acH3, whereas repressive histone marks such as H3K27me3 increased,
resulting in compact chromatin that lost enhancer marks and gained repressor marks on the NKX2-5 promoter.
