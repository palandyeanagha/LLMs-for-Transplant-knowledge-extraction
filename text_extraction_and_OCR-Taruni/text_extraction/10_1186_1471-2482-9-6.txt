Abstract
Background: Incisional hernia after abdominal surgery is a well-known complication. Controversy
still exists with respect to the choice of hernia repair technique. The objective of this study was to
evaluate the long-term recurrence rate as well as surgical complications in a consecutive group of
patients undergoing open repair using an onlay mesh technique.
Methods: Consecutive patients undergoing open incisional hernia repair with onlay-technique
between 01/05/1995 and 01/09/2007 at a single institution were included in the study. For follow￾up patients were contacted by telephone, and answered a questionnaire containing questions
related to the primary operation, the hernia and general risk factors. Patients were examined by a
consultant surgeon in the outpatient clinic or in the patient's home if there was suspicion of an
incisional hernia recurrence.
Results: The study included 56 patients with 100% follow-up. The median follow-up was 35
months (range 4–151). Recurrent incisional hernia was found in 8 of 56 patients (15%, 95% CI: 6–
24). The overall complication rate was 13% (95% CI, 4–22). All complications were minor and
needed no hospital admission.
Conclusion: This study with a long follow-up showed low recurrence and complication rates in
patients undergoing incisional hernia repair with the open onlay technique.
Background
Incisional hernia is a well-known complication after
abdominal surgery, with incidence rates of approximately
3% and 15% after laparoscopic and open surgery, respec￾tively [1]. Hernias are associated with reduced quality of
life and high socioeconomic costs [2]. The treatment of
incisional hernias have changed radically over the last
decade, however controversy still exists concerning mesh
type [3], mesh positioning [4] and operation method,
with laparoscopic repair as an increasingly preferred alter￾native to open surgery [5]. In the present study we evalu￾ated the long-term recurrence and complication rates after
incisional hernia repair with open onlay technique in a
consecutive series of patients.
Methods
The study included consecutive patients who underwent
open hernia repair with onlay technique between May

1995 and September 2007 (see figure 1). All hernias dis￾regarding size were operated by the same technique which
included closure of the hernia defect with non-absorbable
sutures (typically Prolene 2-0) followed by an onlay poly￾propylene mesh (figure 1). Thus, the mesh was placed
superficial to the external fascia also using non-absorba￾ble sutures. Repair operations were carried out by four
senior surgeons at a single institution.
Each patient was contacted by telephone and underwent
a structured interview. The interview contained questions
concerning previous operations for incisional hernia, sus￾pected or diagnosed incisional hernia, and other types of
hernia (e.g. inguinal). All patients were interviewed
between January 2008 and August 2008. A recurrence was
"suspected" if the patient was not sure if he/she had a her￾nia or not. A hernia was "diagnosed" if the primary care
physician or a surgical specialist had examined the patient
and established the diagnosis. In the interview, hernias
were described regarding reducibility, aggravating factors,
cosmetic inconvenience, and mental stress related to the
hernia. Wound length, localisation of the incision, wound
complications and type of treatment were registered as
well as patient related risk factors such as co-morbidity,
use of systemic corticosteroids, and use of alcohol or
tobacco. If the patient had a suspected hernia or a diag￾nosed hernia he was examined by a single consultant sur￾geon in the outpatient clinic or in the patient's home.
Data are reported as frequencies (CI – 95% confidence
intervals) and median (range) unless stated otherwise. For
analysis of categorical and continuous data, Fishers exact
test and Mann Whitney's test were used. P < 0.05 was con￾sidered statistically significant. The study was approved by
the local ethics committee.
Results
A total of 92 patients had an incisional hernia repair with
open onlay technique during the inclusion period. How￾ever, 36 patients could not participate in the study for var￾ious reasons (Figure 2). Thus, the study included 56
patients with 100% follow-up.
Demographics (age, gender, weight, alcohol, tobacco),
risk factors (prostate hypertrophy, diabetes mellitus,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the number of self
reported co-morbidities), the length of the follow-up
period, and hernia related data are presented in table 1.
All demographic data are at the time of follow-up.
The median observation time was 35 months (range 4–
151). In our follow-up we found by clinical examination
that 4 of the 56 patients had developed a hernia. Another
4 patients had undergone a repair operation for a recur￾rent incisional hernia in the follow-up period before the
interview making the total number of recurrences 8 of 56
patients (15%, 95% CI: 6–24).
An overall complication rate of 13% (95% CI, 4–22) was
found. Three patients were treated for seroma or hae￾matoma with evacuation of fluid. One patient was treated
for wound infection with antibiotics. One patient had a
secondary closure of the wound due to exudation, and
one patient had a minor complication, but was unable to
remember the specific treatment at follow up. None of
these patients had a recurrent hernia on follow-up. One
patient was diagnosed with seroma/hematoma but
received no treatment, however, this patient later devel￾oped a hernia. None of these complications required hos￾pital admission, thus there were no serious complications
after the hernia repair.
Discussion
In this study we have shown a low long-term recurrence
rate of 15% and an overall rate of non-serious complica￾tions of 13% after open hernia repair using the onlay
mesh technique in a single institution.
The surgical treatment of incisional hernia has changed
rapidly during the last decade with the increasing use of
mesh technique and the introduction of laparoscopy.
However, many questions concerning mesh type, mesh
positioning, fixation method and operation type still
remain unanswered [3,4]. Patients with incisional hernia
are a heterogeneous population with patient-specific co￾morbidity and innate differences (e.g. collagen formation
quality) [6]. This makes the choice of technique most suit￾able for each patient even more difficult.

A recent retrospective study including 161 patients com￾paring open suture technique with open onlay technique
found recurrence rates of 31% versus 11%(p < 0.05) [7].
The onlay technique was superior with respect to return to
physical activity. Patients operated with the onlay tech￾nique had a significantly higher complication rate
(seroma 42% vs. 8%, suppuration 16% vs. 10%) and
longer hospitalization time (mean 13 vs. 9 days). The con￾clusions of the study were limited by a patient number of
only 28 in the onlay group.
In a randomized clinical trial by Korenkov et al. compar￾ing suture repair, onlay mesh technique and autodermal
graft, the authors found that onlay technique was associ￾ated with a higher serious infection risk and significantly
higher pain scores [4]. The study was ended prematurely
because of the rate of serious complications. The higher
infection rate could not be explained by the authors.
A retrospective study by de Vries Reilingh et al. compared
mesh repair with inlay, onlay and sublay technique, and
concluded that sublay was superior to the other tech￾niques [8]. Onlay technique had a significantly higher
wound complication rate (69%) compared to the inlay
(13%) and sublay (12%) technique. Three patients in the
onlay group developed reherniation (23%). This study
only included 13 patients with onlay technique and had a
mean follow-up of only 19 months.
Kingsnorth et al. found a recurrence rate of 3.4% after a
15.2 month follow up period using the onlay technique
[9]. Post operatively 11 patients (9.5%) developed seroma
and 2 patients (1.7%) had a deep wound infection. The
study was a prospective audit including 116 patients.
Our study included 56 consecutive patients in a single
institution with a median follow-up period of 35 months
(range 4–151). In accordance with previous studies we
chose to combine a structured interview with a clinical
examination [1,10-13]. This method proved to be effec￾tive with a clinical examination of all eligible patients sus￾pected of hernia. Our study group showed no significant
differences with respect to distribution of known risk fac￾tor between patients with or without recurrent hernia.
The onlay technique is a simple and effective repair oper￾ation with a short learning period for the surgeon. For
open incisional hernia repair the choice between inlay,
onlay and sublay technique is often based on tradition
and the individual surgeon's expertise rather than scien￾tific evidence. It has been routine to perform all incisional
hernias by the onlay technique at the institution involved
in the present study, and we therefore don't have any
patients who had been operated by other open tech￾niques. Our study shows that the onlay technique seems
to be safe in terms of complication and recurrence rates
for the patient. In addition this technique requires little
tissue dissection with an easy access to the hernia repair.
These advantages should be taken into consideration
when choosing between laparoscopic and open technique
and when choosing between different open technique.

The laparoscopic approach is generally associated with at
longer learning curve.
The present study has several limitations. It is retrospec￾tive and has a limited number of patients. Twenty oper￾ated patients did not participate, and 16 patients had died
before follow-up. This is a consequence of the long fol￾low-up period. In addition many of the patients lived out￾side the country and could not be contacted to participate
in the follow-up.
The introduction of laparoscopic technique is an increas￾ingly used alternative to open surgery. A prospective ran￾domized study by Olmi et al. compared the short-term
outcome of laparoscopic versus open repair technique
[14]. The authors found significantly shorter operative
time, shorter hospitalization, lower complication rate and
faster return to work when using laparoscopic technique.
There was a total complication rate of 16% among
patients undergoing laparoscopic repair, and 29% among
patient undergoing open surgery. The study included 170
patients and patients were followed for a median of 24
months. The hernia recurrence rate was 2.3% and 1.1% in
the laparoscopic and open group, respectively.
In a recent systematic review by Müller-Riemenschneider
et al., evaluating the long term prognosis, a trend towards
lower recurrence rates, shorter hospital stay, lower com￾plication rates, and lower pain scores after laparoscopic
approach was found, but with a higher frequency of intes￾tinal perforation [5]. However, all identified studies suf￾fered from significant methological limitations such as
different baseline characteristics among patients, short
follow-up periods or small patient numbers, and long￾term results after laparoscopic repair still remains
unknown. Our results, although from a single institution,
show very low and clinical insignificant complication
rates and a very low long-term recurrence rate making the
open onlay mesh technique a serious alternative to lapar￾oscopic repair in selected patients. Future large scale rand￾omized studies should clarify indications for laparoscopic
versus open onlay technique.
Conclusion
We found low long term recurrence and complication
rates after open hernia repair with onlay mesh technique.
These results require confirmation by randomized clinical
trials.
