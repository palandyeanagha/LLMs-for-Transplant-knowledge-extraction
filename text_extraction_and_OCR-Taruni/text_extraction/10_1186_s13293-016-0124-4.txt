Abstract
Background: There is inconclusive evidence about the role of sex as a risk factor for doxorubicin (DOX)-induced
cardiotoxicity. Recent experimental studies have shown that adult female rats are protected against DOX-induced
cardiotoxicity. However, the mechanisms of this sexual dimorphism are not fully elucidated. We have previously
demonstrated that DOX alters the expression of several cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes in the hearts of male rats.
Nevertheless, the sex-dependent effect of DOX on the expression of CYP enzymes is still not known. Therefore, in
the present study, we determined the effect of acute DOX exposure on the expression of CYP genes in the hearts
of both male and female C57Bl/6 mice.
Methods: Acute DOX cardiotoxicity was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of 20 mg/kg DOX in male and
female adult C57Bl/6 mice. Cardiac function was assessed 5 days after DOX exposure by trans-thoracic echocardiography.
Mice were euthanized 1 day or 6 days after DOX or saline injection. Thereafter, the hearts were harvested and weighed.
Heart sections were evaluated for pathological lesions. Total RNA was extracted and expression of natriuretic peptides,
inflammatory and apoptotic markers, and CYP genes was measured by real-time PCR.
Results: Adult female C57Bl/6 mice were protected from acute DOX-induced cardiotoxicity as they show milder
pathological lesions, less inflammation, and faster recovery from DOX-induced apoptosis and DOX-mediated
inhibition of beta-type natriuretic peptide. Acute DOX exposure altered the gene expression of multiple CYP
genes in a sex-dependent manner. In 24 h, DOX exposure caused male-specific induction of Cyp1b1 and
female-specific induction of Cyp2c29 and Cyp2e1.
Conclusions: Acute DOX exposure causes sex-dependent alteration of cardiac CYP gene expression. Since
cardiac CYP enzymes metabolize several endogenous compounds to biologically active metabolites, sex-dependent
alteration of CYP genes may play a role in the sexual dimorphism of acute DOX-induced cardiotoxicity.

Background
Doxorubicin (DOX) is a very effective chemotherapeutic
agent commonly used to treat both hematological malig￾nancies and solid tumors [1]. Nevertheless, the clinical
use of this highly effective agent is limited by dose￾dependent cardiotoxicity that can progress to cardiac
dysfunction and heart failure [2]. The exact mechanism
of DOX-induced cardiotoxicity is not fully elucidated;
however, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction,
derailed molecular signaling, inflammation, and apop￾totic cell death are believed to be important players [3].
Since cardiac dysfunction does not occur in every DOX￾treated cancer patient, there is a growing interest in
identifying risk factors that predispose some patients to
DOX-induced cardiotoxicity [4, 5]. Several factors have
been shown to increase the risk of DOX-induced cardio￾toxicity including total cumulative dose, pre-existing car￾diovascular disease, and combination treatment with
other cardiotoxic chemotherapeutic agents such as
trastuzumab [5]. However, there is inconclusive and

conflicting evidence for the role of sex as a risk factor for
DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. It is widely accepted that fe￾male sex is a risk factor for DOX-induced cardiotoxicity in
pediatric cancer patients [6, 7]; nevertheless, adult female
patients have been shown to be less sensitive to DOX￾induced cardiac adverse effects in some studies [1, 8, 9].
Female patients in this age group are likely to have high
levels of sex hormones, suggesting a key role of sex hor￾mones in mediating the protective effect of female sex
against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. In accordance with
this notion, sex has not been shown to be a significant risk
factor for DOX-induced cardiotoxicity in elderly cancer pa￾tients [10], implying a diminishing protective effect of
female sex with the decline of sex hormone levels in the
elderly. In more controlled experimental studies, we and
others have shown that adult female rodents are protected
against chronic DOX-induced cardiotoxicity [11–16].
Several mechanisms have been postulated to explain sexual
dimorphism of chronic DOX-induced cardiotoxicity includ￾ing differences in myocardial energy metabolism, mast cell
activation, and cardiolipin remodeling [11, 12, 14]. Since
the mechanisms of acute DOX-induced cardiotoxicity may
be different from those of chronic cardiotoxicity [17], it is
important to investigate the mechanisms of sex-related dif￾ferences in acute DOX-induced cardiotoxicity.
We have demonstrated that acute DOX-induced cardio￾toxicity alters the expression of several cytochrome P450
(CYP) enzymes in the H9c2 cardiomyoblasts in vitro [18]
and in the hearts of male Sprague Dawley rats in vivo [19].
DOX-induced alteration of CYP enzymes may have im￾portant toxicological implications, due to the role of CYP
enzymes in the metabolism of several biologically active
endogenous compounds including arachidonic acid and
sex steroids [20]. Sex-divergent expression of CYP genes
has been well studied in the liver; however, a few studies
have also reported sex-divergent expression of CYP genes
in other organs [21]. Of interest, a recent study has dem￾onstrated sex-dependent expression of some CYP genes in
the rodent heart [22]. Nevertheless, the sex-dependent
effect of DOX on CYP gene expression is still not known.
Therefore, in the present study, we determined the effect
of acute DOX exposure on the gene expression of CYP
enzymes in the hearts of both male and female C57Bl/6
mice to determine the interaction between sex and DOX
exposure in regulating CYP gene expression. We demon￾strate for the first time that DOX-induced alteration of
CYP gene expression is sex-dependent which may explain,
at least in part, the sex-related differences of DOX￾induced cardiotoxicity.
Methods
Animals
All experimental procedures involving animals have
been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee (IACUC) at the University of Minnesota. All
animals were housed under environmentally controlled
conditions in an Association for Assessment and
Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC)
accredited facility according to the National Institutes of
Health (NIH) guidelines and had free access to food and
water during the study period. Twelve-week-old male
(n = 31) and female (n = 26) C57Bl/6 mice were pur￾chased from Charles River Laboratories (Raleigh, NC).
After a 1 week acclimation period, mice were ran￾domized to receive either 20 mg/kg DOX by intraper￾itoneal (IP) injection (DOX group) or equivalent
volume of sterile normal saline (control group).
Twenty-four hours after the DOX or saline injection,
a cohort of mice (8 male-control, 8 male-DOX, 8
female-control, and 8 female-DOX) were humanely
euthanized. The hearts were collected, washed in ice￾cold phosphate buffered saline solution, flash frozen
in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until further
analysis. Another cohort of mice (6 male-control, 9
male-DOX, 5 female-control, and 5 female-DOX)
were followed up daily for 6 days. Mortality was ob￾served only in the male-DOX group. By the 5th day
after the DOX injection, 4 male mice had been found
dead in their cages. On the 5th day, echocardiography
was performed on the surviving mice (6 male-control,
5 male-DOX, 5 female-control, and 5 female-DOX).
Another DOX-treated male mouse died just after the
echocardiography. Although we performed daily checks
on these mice to humanely euthanize any mouse showing
marked morbidity, it seems that the mice’ health deterio￾rated rapidly within a 24-h period (between our daily
checks). The surviving mice (6 male-control, 4 male￾DOX, 5 female-control, and 5 female-DOX) were hu￾manely euthanized and their hearts were collected,
washed in ice-cold phosphate buffered saline, a section
from the left ventricle was cut for histopathology analysis,
and the remaining tissue was flash frozen in liquid nitro￾gen, and stored at −80 °C until further analysis.
Echocardiography
On the fifth day following DOX administration, echocar￾diography was performed using a Vevo® 2100 system
(VisualSonics, Inc., Toronto, Ontario, Canada). Mice
were anesthetized in a chamber with 5% isoflurane and
100% oxygen, and anesthesia was maintained with
1–1.5% isoflurane while the mouse was securely placed
in a supine position for the procedure. The total time
for each procedure was approximately 10–20 min. The
following measures were obtained: diastolic and systolic
areas and their volumes, stroke volume, cardiac output,
ejection fraction, fractional shortening, and left ventricu￾lar wall thickness.

Histopathology
Tissue sections were collected at the same level of the
left ventricle, fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin,
processed, and embedded in paraffin using standard
methods. Thereafter, four-micron tissue sections were
cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) or
trichome stain. Histopathologic evaluation was per￾formed by a board certified veterinary pathologist who
was blinded to the sex and the received treatment. The
cardiac lesions were analyzed using a modified version
of a myocardial biopsy scoring system [23]. Each stained
section was examined for (a) myocyte vacuolization, (b)
myocyte necrosis, (c) myocyte loss, and (d) interstitial
cellularity (e.g., fibrosis or inflammation). For myocyte
vacuolization, sections were principally scored based
upon the number of cardiomyocytes with cytoplasmic
vacuoles as follows: 0, no vacuolization observed; 1, few
(<25%) cells with vacuoles; 2, occasional (26–50%) cells
with vacuoles; 3, moderate numbers (51–75%) of cells
with vacuoles; and 4, many cells (>76%) with vacuoles.
For any section in which individual severely vacuolated
cardiomyocytes (i.e., Adria cells) were identified, the
score was elevated 1 point. For myocyte necrosis and
loss, sections were scored based upon the number of
affected cells as follows: 0, no necrosis or loss observed;
1, rare (1–5%) cells affected; 2, few (6–10%) cells
affected; 3, modest number (11–15%) of cells affected;
and 4, many (≥16%) cells affected. Interstitial cellularity,
which comprised inflammation or fibrosis, was assessed
as follows: 0, absent; 1, minimal interstitial infiltration; 2,
mild interstitial infiltration; 3, moderate interstitial infil￾tration; and 4, marked interstitial infiltration.
RNA extraction
Total RNA from the frozen tissues was isolated using
TRIzol® reagent (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and quan￾tified by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm using a
Nanodrop 8000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Wilmington, DE). The quality of the extracted
RNA was determined by measuring the RNA integrity
number (RIN) values (Additional file 1 shows a repre￾sentative figure of RIN measurements) using an Agilent
2100 Bioanalyzer (Santa Clara, CA). Thereafter, first￾strand cDNA was synthesized by using the High-Capacity
cDNA reverse transcription kit (Life Technologies,
Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer’s in￾structions. In brief, 1.5 μg of total RNA from each
sample was added to a mix of 1.0 μl MultiScribe™ re￾verse transcriptase (RT), 2.0 μl 10X RT buffer, 0.8 μl
25X dNTP mix (100 mM), 2.0 μl 10X RT random
primers, and 4.2 μl nuclease-free water. The final
reaction mix was kept at 25 °C for 10 min, heated to
37 °C for 120 min, heated for 85 °C for 5 min, and
finally cooled to 4 °C in a Tetrad 2 thermal cycler
(Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA).
Real-time PCR
Quantitative analysis of specific mRNA expression was
performed by real time-polymerase chain reaction
(PCR), by subjecting the resulting cDNA to PCR amplifi￾cation using 384-well optical reaction plates in the ABI
7900HT instrument (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
CA). The 20-μl reaction mix contained 1 μl of cDNA
sample, 10 μl of SYBR Green Universal Mastermix (Life
Technologies, Carlsbad, CA), 0.025 μl of 30 μM forward
primer and 0.025 μl of 30 μM reverse primer (40 nM
final concentration of each primer), and 8.95 μl of
nuclease-free water. We assessed acute DOX-induced
cardiotoxicity by measuring the gene expression of atrial
natriuretic peptide (ANP) and B-type natriuretic peptide
(BNP) as markers of cardiac stress [19], cyclooxygenase￾2 (COX-2) as an inflammatory marker [24], and Bcl-2
associated X protein/B-cell lymphoma-2 (BAX/Bcl-2) as
an apoptotic marker [24]. Since we previously reported
changes of certain CYP genes by acute DOX exposure in
male rats [19], the mouse orthologs of those rat CYP
genes were selected for the current study. We used
β-actin as a house-keeping gene, and its expression was
not significantly different between sexes or between
treatments. To confirm that the observed changes were
due to actual changes in the genes of interest, some ana￾lyses were repeated using 18S as a housekeeping gene,
and similar results were obtained. The primers used in
the current study were chosen from previously published
studies [25–30], checked with the Primer-BLAST on￾line tool [31], and are listed in Additional file 2. After
sealing the plate with an optical adhesive cover, ther￾mocycling was initiated at 95 °C for 10 min, followed
by 40 PCR cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 15 s,
and annealing/extension at 60 °C for 1 min. Melting
curve was performed by the end of each cycle to con￾firm the specificity of the primers and the purity of
the final PCR product.
Real time-PCR Data analysis
The analysis of real time-PCR data was performed using
the relative gene expression i.e., (ΔΔCT) method as
described in Applied Biosystems User Bulletin No.2 and
explained further by Livak et al. [32]. In brief, the data in
all groups are presented as the fold change in gene ex￾pression normalized to the endogenous reference gene
(β-actin) and relative to male control animals of the
same time point.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using the GraphPad
Prism software (version 7.01, 12 June 2016, La Jolla, CA).

Results are presented as mean ± SEM. Comparisons
among different sex and treatment groups were done by
2-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), followed by Tukey’s
multiple comparison test as a post-hoc analysis. To cor￾rect for multiple comparisons, a false discovery rate of 5%
was applied for p values of DOX effect, sex effect, and
interaction effect on CYP gene expressions by the Two￾stage linear step-up procedure of Benjamini, Krieger, and
Yekutieli. Histopathologic grading of lesions is presented
as median with 95% confidence interval of the median.
Statistical analysis for histopathologic grading was per￾formed using Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric test. p or q
values of <0.05 were considered statistically significant.
Results
Female mice are less sensitive to DOX-induced cardiotoxicity
than males
To document sex-related differences of DOX-induced
cardiotoxicity in C57Bl/6 mice, acute DOX cardiotoxi￾city was induced by a single IP injection of 20 mg/kg
DOX in male and female mice. In contrast to the female
mice, all of which survived until the 6th day after DOX
injection, there was a significantly increased mortality (5/9,
55%) in male mice (Additional file 3). Acute DOX-induced
toxicity resulted in a significant 7 and 11% reduction in
body weight 1 day after DOX injection; and 19 and 18% re￾duction in body weight 6 days after DOX injection, in male
and female mice, respectively (Fig. 1a). Acute DOX expos￾ure also caused a significant 6 and 7% reduction of heart
weight to tibial length ratio 1 day after DOX administra￾tion, and 20 and 21% reduction of heart weight to tibial
length ratio 6 days after DOX administration in male and
female mice, respectively (Fig. 1b). The cardiac function of
female mice and surviving male mice was assessed by
trans-thoracic echocardiography on the 5th day after DOX
injection. There was a trend toward lower stroke volume
(Fig. 1c) in the surviving DOX-treated male mice; however,
it did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.41). There was
no significant difference in the left ventricular ejection frac￾tion or fractional shortening between control and DOX￾treated mice in either male or female mice (data not
shown). Nevertheless, acute DOX cardiotoxicity caused
more pronounced histopathological changes in the hearts
of male than female mice (Fig. 2 and Table 1).
Effect of acute DOX-induced cardiotoxicity on ANP and BNP
In order to further characterize the sexual dimorphism of
acute DOX-mediated cardiotoxicity in C57Bl/6 mice, we
determined the sex-dependent effect of DOX on the gene
expression of the natriuretic peptides, ANP and BNP.
Acute DOX-mediated cardiotoxicity did not significantly
change the gene expression of ANP in either male or fe￾male animals (Fig. 3a). In contrast, DOX caused a marked
inhibition of BNP expression in both sexes (Fig. 3b). At
24 h after DOX administration, gene expression of BNP
was lower by 87 and 83% than sex-matched controls in the
male and female mice, respectively (Fig. 3b). Of interest,
6 days after DOX administration, BNP was still inhibited by

after DOX or saline administration in male or female mice (n = 5–6 per
group). Values are expressed as mean ± SEM. *p < 0.05, compared to

84% in male mice, but it had returned to a control value in
female mice (Fig. 3b), indicating a recovery from DOX￾mediated inhibition of BNP in hearts of female mice.
Effect of acute DOX-induced cardiotoxicity on inflammatory
and apoptotic markers
Since inflammation and apoptosis play important roles in
the pathogenesis of acute DOX cardiotoxicity [24, 33, 34],
we determined the effect of DOX on the cardiac expres￾sion of the inflammatory marker COX-2 and the apoptotic
marker BAX/Bcl-2 in both male and female mice. Acute
DOX exposure caused a significant 2.3-fold induction of
the inflammatory marker COX-2 gene expression in the
hearts of male mice 24 h after DOX administration. In a
sex-dependent manner, acute DOX exposure did not
cause a significant difference in COX-2 gene expression in

female mice (Fig. 4a). Six days following DOX administra￾tion, there was a trend toward an increased COX-2 ex￾pression in the hearts of male mice (p = 0.06), but the
increase did not reach statistical significance (Fig. 4a).
While acute DOX exposure caused a significant 3.4- and
4.5-fold induction of BAX/Bcl-2 gene expression in the
hearts of male and female mice, respectively, 24 h after
DOX administration, BAX/Bcl-2 was still induced in
hearts of male mice by 3.8-fold, but it returned to a con￾trol value in the hearts of female mice 6 days after DOX
administration (Fig. 4b), indicating a recovery from DOX￾induced apoptosis in the hearts of female mice.
Acute DOX exposure results in sexually dimorphic alterations
in CYP expression
Cyp1 family
One day following DOX injection, a greater than 80% re￾duction in the expression of Cyp1a1 in the heart was ob￾served in both male and female mice (p value = 0.05 in
males). Cyp1a1 gene expression returned to a control
value in females, but not in males, 6 days post-DOX
(Fig. 5a), demonstrating a significant sex effect (Table 2 and
Additional file 5). In contrast to Cyp1a1, acute DOX
exposure caused a significant twofold induction of
Cyp1b1 gene expression in the hearts of male mice
1 day after DOX injection. A further increase (fourfold)
was observed 6 days after DOX injection. Of interest,
DOX toxicity did not alter Cyp1b1 gene expression in the
female heart (Fig. 5b) as there was a significant interaction
between sex and DOX exposure 1 day post-DOX and a
significant sex effect 6 days post-DOX (Table 2 and
Additional files 4 and 5).
Cyp2 family
Expression of Cyp2c29 and Cyp2c44 was increased by
twofold and eightfold, respectively, by DOX in the hearts
of female animals 1 day after treatment. While there was
no significant change in Cyp2c29 gene expression in the
hearts of male mice at 24 h or 6 days after DOX admin￾istration, acute DOX exposure caused a non-significant
fourfold induction of Cyp2c44 in hearts of male mice
24 h after DOX administration (p = 0.54) (Fig. 6a, b).
Additionally, there was a significant interaction between
sex and DOX exposure in Cyp2c29 gene expression 24 h
post-DOX (Table 2 and Additional file 4). A greater than

eightfold induction of Cyp2e1 gene expression was
observed in the hearts of female mice 1 day post-DOX,
which returned to a control value 6 days after treatment
(Fig. 7a). A non-significant 3.4-fold induction in Cyp2e1
gene expression was observed in the heart of male mice
(p = 0.35), demonstrating a significant interaction between
sex and DOX exposure 24 h post-DOX (Table 2 and
Additional file 4). Acute DOX exposure caused a signifi￾cant twofold and threefold induction of Cyp2j9 gene
expression 1 day following DOX treatment in the heart of
male and female mice, respectively. In both sexes, there
was no significant difference in Cyp2j9 gene expression
between control and DOX-treated animals 6 days after
DOX administration (Fig. 7b).
Cyp4 family
Acute exposure to DOX significantly increased Cyp4a10
mRNA levels in hearts of both male and female mice
(twofold and sixfold induction, respectively) 1 day after
DOX administration. This was reversed in both sexes
6 days after treatment (Fig. 8). Interestingly, Cyp4a10
gene expression was lower in the hearts of female con￾trol mice than in male control mice in the 24 hour co￾hort (Fig. 8) with a significant effect of sex on Cyp4a10
expression (Table 2 and Additional file 4). While the
Cyp4a10 gene expression was lower in the hearts of
female control mice than in male control mice in the
6 days cohort as well, the difference was not statistically
significant (p = 0.6).
Discussion
Sex-related differences in DOX-induced cardiotoxicity
have been well documented in several rat species, in￾cluding Wistar rats [12, 14], spontaneously hypertensive
rats (SHR) [11], and spontaneously hypertensive heart
failure-prone rats (SHHF) [15]. Recently, sexual di￾morphism of chronic DOX-induced cardiotoxicity has
also been reported in B6C3F1 mice [16]. However, sex￾ual dimorphism of acute DOX-induced cardiotoxicity
has never been shown in mice, despite the ubiquitous
use of mice as a model for acute DOX-induced cardio￾toxicity [35–37]. Therefore, in the current work, we
demonstrate for the first time a significant sexual di￾morphism of acute DOX-induced cardiotoxicity in one
of the most commonly used mouse strains, the C57Bl/6

mouse. Acute cardiotoxicity in adult mice was induced by
a single IP injection of 20 mg/kg DOX. This dose has been
previously used to induce acute cardiotoxicity in adult
male mice in several studies [35, 37]. Similar to these pre￾vious studies, DOX administration caused significant tox￾icity in male mice in our study as demonstrated by
significant mortality, a decrease in heart and body weights,
and cardiac histopathological lesions. Similar to previous
studies, female mice are protected against several features
of DOX-induced toxicity [11, 12, 14–16]. Indeed, there
was no mortality and milder histopathological lesions in
female mice. However, a decrease in body and heart
weights was observed in both male and female mice.
These results corroborate the findings of a previous study
where chronic DOX treatment caused a significant weight
loss in both male and female Wistar rats, with 50% mor￾tality only in male rats [12]. It is important to mention
that the observed mortality in male mice can also be at￾tributed to acute DOX-induced multi-organ toxicity in￾cluding bone marrow toxicity, gastrointestinal toxicity,
nephrotoxicity, and/or hepatotoxicity [38–40]. Determining
sex-related differences of acute DOX-induced toxicity in
these organs warrants further research.

To further document the observed sexual dimorphism,
we measured the gene expression of the natriuretic pep￾tides, ANP and BNP, the inflammatory marker, COX-2,
and the apoptotic marker, BAX/Bcl-2, in the hearts of
male and female mice. In the current study, acute DOX￾induced cardiotoxicity caused a marked inhibition in the
expression of BNP, but not ANP, 24 h following DOX
administration in both male and female mice. In agree￾ment with our findings, DOX selectively inhibited BNP
versus ANP in cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes
[41]. Similarly, we have previously shown that acute
DOX cardiotoxicity caused an earlier and a more pro￾nounced inhibition of BNP as compared to ANP in the
hearts of male Sprague Dawley rats [19]. The inhibition
of BNP by acute DOX cardiotoxicity can be attributed to
the DOX suppression of GATA-4 [42] which is known
to regulate BNP expression [43]. Of importance, a
marked sex-dependent difference in BNP gene expres￾sion was found 6 days after DOX administration. The
gene expression of BNP is markedly inhibited in the
hearts of DOX-treated male mice, but not in DOX￾treated female mice. Since apoptosis is known to play an
important role in mediating acute DOX-induced cardio￾toxicity [24], we measured the gene expression of the
apoptotic marker, BAX/Bcl-2. Acute DOX cardiotoxicity
has been previously demonstrated to induce BAX/Bcl-2
gene expression in the hearts of male mice [44]. In our
current work, we also demonstrate that acute DOX
exposure caused a significant induction of BAX/Bcl-2
gene expression in the hearts of both male and female
mice 24 h after DOX administration. However, in a sex￾dependent manner, BAX/Bcl-2 gene expression returned
to control values 6 days after DOX injection in the
hearts of female, but not male mice. The early marked
inhibition of BNP and induction of BAX/Bcl-2 in both
male and female mice may imply that both sexes had
been exposed to equal DOX-induced early injury, but
the females have certain compensatory mechanisms that
allowed them to recover from this initial injury and re￾lieve both DOX-mediated inhibition of BNP and DOX￾induced apoptosis 6 days later. The recovery from
DOX-mediated inhibition of BNP in the hearts of female
mice may indicate a relief from DOX-induced suppres￾sion of GATA-4. In contrast to BNP and BAX/Bcl2,
DOX-mediated cardiotoxicity increased the expression
of COX-2 in the hearts of male, but not female mice
24 h after DOX administration, indicating a potential
role of inflammation in mediating the early pathology of
acute DOX-induced cardiotoxicity in male mice.
A few mechanisms have been previously proposed to
explain the sexual dimorphism of DOX-induced cardio￾toxicity, including sex-related differences in cardiac
energy metabolism [12], cardiolipin remodeling [14], and
mast cell activity [11]. Several investigators attributed
this sexual dimorphism to the cardioprotection conferred
by estrogen in female experimental animals [11, 13, 45].
Intriguingly, another study showed that the expression of
carbonyl reductase, a major DOX-metabolizing enzyme, is
higher in the kidney and liver of female than in male mice
[46]. The authors suggested that higher expression of car￾bonyl reductase may make female mice more sensitive to
DOX-induced toxicity; however, DOX-induced cardiotoxi￾city was not actually assessed in their study [46]. There￾fore, the underlying mechanisms of sexual dimorphism in
DOX-induced toxicity are still poorly understood. A grow￾ing body of evidence suggests an important role of CYP
enzymes in the pathogenesis of DOX-induced cardiotoxi￾city [19, 47, 48]. CYP enzymes play important roles in me￾tabolizing sex steroids and other endogenous compounds,
such as arachidonic acid that have significant biological
effects on the cardiovascular system [20]. Interestingly,
there is a significant sex-divergent expression of several
CYP enzymes in both humans and experimental animals
[49]. Therefore, we hypothesized that DOX alters CYP
enzymes in a sex-dependent manner to mediate sexual
dimorphism of DOX-induced cardiotoxicity.
In the current study, acute DOX exposure caused a
marked inhibition of Cyp1a1 gene expression in the
hearts of male and female mice 1 day after DOX injec￾tion. In contrast to this finding, we have previously
reported that acute DOX-induced cardiotoxicity caused
significant induction of CYP1A1 in the hearts of male
Sprague Dawley rats [19]. Similarly, a single 10 mg/kg
DOX injection caused significant induction of Cyp1a1 in
the hearts of 8-week-old male C57Bl/6 mice [50]. In
order to confirm our current finding, we used three dif￾ferent sets of Cyp1a1 primers selected from three differ￾ent studies (Additional file 2). The three different
experiments resulted in the same finding, confirming the
inhibition of Cyp1a1 gene expression in this study.
Therefore, the discrepancy may be due to the difference
in the dose of DOX and/or the age of mice. DOX￾mediated inhibition of Cyp1a1 may be attributed to
DOX-induced inflammation, since inflammation has
been shown to downregulate Cyp1a1 in the hearts of
male C57Bl/6 mice [51]. However, this notion cannot ex￾plain the inhibition of Cyp1a1 in the hearts of female
mice, since they had minimal inflammation. Of interest,
the gene expression of Cyp1a1 returned to a control
value 6 days after DOX administration in female, but
not in male mice, indicating the recovery of the female
hearts from the early DOX-induced injury.
DOX administration caused a significant induction of
Cyp1b1 in the hearts of male mice 24 h and 6 days after
DOX injection, but not in the hearts of female mice. In
agreement with this finding, we have previously reported
DOX-mediated induction of CYP1B1 in the heart of
male SD rats [19], and in the cardiac-derived H9c2 cells
Grant et al. Biology of Sex Differences (2017) 8:1 Page 9 of 13

[18]. The male-specific induction of Cyp1b1 by DOX
may play an important role in mediating the sexual di￾morphism of DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. In male ro￾dents, Cyp1b1 has been shown to mediate DOX-induced
cardiotoxicity via the metabolism of arachidonic acid to
the cardiotoxic mid-chain hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid
metabolites [48], and hypertension-associated cardiomy￾opathy via the metabolism of testosterone to the more
cardiotoxic metabolite, 6β-hydroxytestosterone [52].
Inhibition of CYP1B1 in the two previous studies con￾ferred significant protection against both DOX-induced
cardiotoxicity and hypertension-associated cardiomyop￾athy [48, 52].
We have previously shown that acute DOX-induced
cardiotoxicity causes significant induction of CYP2C11
in the hearts of male Sprague Dawley rats [19]. In the
present study, DOX administration caused a modest
non-statistically significant induction of Cyp2c44 24 h
after DOX injection in the hearts of male mice. On the
other hand, acute DOX exposure caused a marked in￾duction of Cyp2c29 and Cyp2c44 gene expression in the
heart of female mice 24 h after DOX administration.
Cyp2c enzymes are important epoxygenases which may
play a role in protecting the female heart by producing
cardioprotective metabolites such as the epoxyeicosatrie￾noic acids [53]. Sun et al. have found that shear stress
upregulated Cyp2c29 expression and increased the
protective epoxyeicosatrienoic acids in female mice by
an estrogen-dependent mechanism [54]. Interestingly,
ovariectomized female rats have been shown to be as
sensitive as male rats to DOX-induced cardiotoxicity
[11], which further confirms the protective role of estro￾gen against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity.
Similar to Cyp2c29, acute DOX-induced cardiotoxicity
induced the gene expression of Cyp2e1 only in the
hearts of female mice 24 h following DOX administra￾tion. In agreement with our current findings in male
mice, we have previously demonstrated that acute DOX
cardiotoxicity did not change CYP2E1 expression in the
hearts of male Sprague Dawley rats [19]. However, DOX
induced CYP2E1 in a concentration-dependent manner
in H9c2 cardiomyoblasts in vitro [18]. Despite the
well-documented role of hepatic Cyp2e1 in mediating
alcohol-induced hepatotoxicity [55], the role of cardiac
Cyp2e1 is not well studied. Pharmacological inhibition
and genetic knock down of Cyp2e1 have been shown to
confer cardioprotection in a DOX-induced dilated car￾diomyopathy mouse model by inhibiting oxidative stress
and apoptosis [56]. Nevertheless, Cyp2e1 metabolizes
arachidonic acid to 19-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid
which has cardioprotective properties [57]. Therefore,
further research is needed to confirm whether cardiac
Cyp2e1 is protective or detrimental to the heart. Similar
to our previous studies in male Sprague Dawley rats [19]
and H9c2 cardiomyoblasts [18], acute DOX cardiotoxicity
increased Cyp2j9 gene expression in the hearts of both
male and female mice. Cyp2j9 is an omega-1 hydroxylase
enzyme that metabolizes arachidonic acid to the presum￾ably cardioprotective 19-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid
[58]. Therefore, induction of Cyp2j9 by DOX can be an
adaptive mechanism to protect the heart from further
DOX-induced toxicity.
Fig. 9 Sex-dependent alteration of cardiac cytochrome CYP gene expression by doxorubicin. Doxorubicin causes male-specific induction of
Cyp1b1 gene expression. Cyp1b1 enzyme is known to generate cardiotoxic metabolites such as mid-chain hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs)
and/or 6β-hydroxytestosterone. On the other hand, DOX causes female-specific induction of Cyp2c29 and Cyp2e1 gene expression. Cyp2c29 and
Cyp2e1 enzymes are known to generate cardioprotective metabolites such as epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) and 19-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic
acid (19-HETE)

Several studies have investigated the sexual divergence
of Cyp4a10 expression in the kidney and liver of differ￾ent strains of mice. In one study, there was no sex￾dependent difference in the expression of Cyp4a10 in
the kidney of C57Bl/6 mice [59]. In another study,
Cyp4a10 was expressed at a higher level in the liver and
kidney of female than in male C57Bl/6 mice [21]. To the
best of our knowledge, there is no information about
sex-related differences in Cyp4a10 expression in the
mouse heart. In the current study, we found that the ex￾pression of Cyp4a10 was significantly lower in the hearts
of control female than in control male mice in the 24-h
cohort, suggesting organ-specific sexual divergence in
Cyp4a10 expression. Although the expression of
Cyp4a10 in the hearts of female mice was 60% of its
expression in male mice in the 6-day cohort, this differ￾ence was not statistically significant. There are three
possibilities that may explain this controversy: first, con￾trol mice are not “naïve” control mice i.e., they were
administered an IP injection of sterile saline in equal
volumes to DOX injections. These injections with the
associated stress may modulate the sex effect at the two
different time points (24 h and 6 days after the saline in￾jection). Second, the 6-day mice had undergone echocar￾diography under isoflurane anesthesia which may have
also modulated this sex effect. Finally, this difference
may just be due to different statistical power, since the
number of animals in the 24-h cohort was higher than
that of the 6-day cohort allowing for more power to
detect differences. Lower expression of cardiac Cyp4a10
may contribute to the overall protection of females
against heart disease as Cyp4a10 has been shown to
metabolize arachidonic acid to the cardiotoxic metabol￾ite 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid [59]. Despite a lower
constitutive expression of Cyp4a10 in the female hearts,
acute DOX-induced cardiotoxicity caused a marked
induction of Cyp4a10 in the hearts of both male and
female mice, suggesting that this enzyme may not
play an important role in the sexual dimorphism of
DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. In agreement with previ￾ous studies [60, 61], the mRNA levels of Cyp4a12
and Cyp4a14 were below the levels of detection in
the hearts of both male and female mice in the
current study (data not shown).
Conclusions
In conclusion, we have identified significant sex-related
differences in acute DOX-induced cardiotoxicity in adult
C57Bl/6 mice. These findings corroborate previous stud￾ies that demonstrated marked sexual dimorphism of
acute and chronic DOX-induced cardiotoxicity in several
rat strains. Since the C57Bl/6 mouse is a popular model
in studies of acute DOX-induced cardiotoxicity, charac￾terizing these sex-related differences is very important to
guide researchers to properly interpret the results
obtained from female mouse models of acute DOX￾induced cardiotoxicity. In addition, we have demon￾strated for the first time that acute DOX exposure
alters CYP gene expression in a sex-dependent man￾ner. As illustrated in Fig. 9, significant male-specific
induction of Cyp1b1 and female-specific induction of
Cyp2c29 and Cyp2e1 may play important roles in me￾diating sex-related differences of DOX-induced cardi￾otoxicity. A limitation to this study, however, is that
we only measured the gene expression of these
enzymes. Therefore, the protein expression and activ￾ity toward metabolism of different substrates are to
be confirmed in future studies.
