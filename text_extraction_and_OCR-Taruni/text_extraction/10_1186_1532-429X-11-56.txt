Abstract
Background: T2-Weighted (T2W) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) pulse sequences have been
used to detect edema in patients with acute myocardial infarction and differentiate acute from
chronic infarction. T2W sequences have suffered from several problems including (i) signal intensity
variability caused by phased array coils, (ii) high signal from slow moving ventricular chamber blood
that can mimic and mask elevated T2 in sub-endocardial myocardium, (iii) motion artifacts, and (iv)
the subjective nature of T2W image interpretation. In this work we demonstrate the advantages
of a quantitative T2 mapping technique to accurately and reliably detect regions of edematous
myocardial tissue without the limitations of qualitative T2W imaging.
Methods: Methods of T2 mapping were evaluated on phantoms; the best of these protocols was
then optimized for in vivo imaging. The optimized protocol was used to study the spatial, view￾dependent, and inter-subject variability and motion sensitivity in healthy subjects. Using the insights
gained from this, the utility of T2 mapping was demonstrated in a porcine model of acute
myocardial infarction (AMI) and in three patients with AMI.
Results: T2-prepared SSFP demonstrated greater accuracy in estimating the T2 of phantoms than
multi-echo turbo spin echo. The T2 of human myocardium was found to be 52.18 ± 3.4 ms (range:
48.96 ms to 55.67 ms), with variability between subjects unrelated to heart rate. Unlike T2W
images, T2 maps did not show any signal variation due to the variable sensitivity of phased array
coils and were insensitive to cardiac motion. In the three pigs and three patients with AMI, the T2
of the infarcted region was significantly higher than that of remote myocardium.
Conclusion: Quantitative T2 mapping addresses the well-known problems associated with T2W
imaging of the heart and offers the potential for increased accuracy in the detection of myocardial
edema.

Background
Many pathologic conditions alter the myocardial tissue
water content, which in turn alters the T2 relaxation time.
Higgins et al. [1] showed in 1983 a direct relation between
T2 relaxation time and myocardial water content in a
canine model of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). More
recently, studies on animals [2-4] and patients [5-7] have
demonstrated that increased myocardial T2 may be asso￾ciated not only with AMI, but also with severe transient
myocardial ischemia. Elevated myocardial T2 is also
known to accompany myocarditis [8] and cardiac allo￾graft rejection [9]. These and other studies using T2 to
characterize pathological changes in myocardium have
relied on T2-Weighted (T2W) imaging with a dark blood
turbo spin echo technique [10]. Recent review [11] and
editorials [12,13] have acknowledged a set of challenges
that continue to limit the widespread clinical acceptance
of T2W imaging. These limitations include: i) phased￾array coils cause regional myocardial signal variation that
can lead to inaccurate interpretation and diagnosis; ii)
high signal from stagnant blood makes it difficult to dif￾ferentiate edema from sub-endocardial blood; iii) myo￾cardial signal loss caused by through-plane motion; and
iv) the qualitative nature of T2W imaging where interpre￾tation depends on regional differences in myocardial sig￾nal intensity, which may vary depending on sequence
parameters (echo times, slice thickness etc.). Two recently
introduced techniques [14,15] address several of these
listed deficiencies, but these new methods are also quali￾tative and still depend on subjective interpretation of T2W
images and relative regional differences in myocardial sig￾nal intensity.
An alternative approach to T2W imaging is to directly
quantify the T2 of the myocardium. Using quantitative
T2-mapping, the artifacts associated with T2W imaging
may be minimized, image contrast dependency on user￾defined parameters and subjective interpretation can be
reduced, and subtle T2 differences between tissues may be
more easily detected. Over the past 25 years a number of
in vivo studies have measured the T2 of healthy human
myocardium (Table 1), primarily using techniques based
on spin echo acquisitions. These methods are time-con￾suming and prone to the same motion sensitivity that has
plagued T2W imaging of the heart. Myocardial T2-map￾ping techniques using T2-prepared steady-state free pre￾cession (T2p-SSFP) have been described recently by
Huang et al. [16] for BOLD imaging, and as a combined
T1 and T2 mapping method by Blume et al. [17] for differ￾entiation of acute from chronic myocardial infarction.
While these were promising initial studies, neither inves￾tigated the potential for T2-mapping to address the
known limitations of T2W imaging caused by residual
blood signal, surface coil intensity variation, and myocar￾dial motion artifact.
The objectives of the present work were to i) demonstrate
a practical T2-mapping method based on T2p-SSFP that
minimizes the problems of current T2W imaging meth￾ods; ii) report a comprehensive analysis of T2 computed
over the entire myocardium vis-à-vis variation across slice
positions and orientations, subjects, and myocardial seg￾ments; iii) demonstrate this technique in a porcine model
of AMI, and in patients with AMI. We hypothesize that
quantitative T2-mapping addresses the limitations of
qualitative T2W imaging and provides a practical and
accurate method of assessing myocardial edema associ￾ated with acute ischemia, infarction, and other pathologi￾cal conditions affecting myocardial water content.
Materials and methods
The T2-mapping pulse sequence was developed on a 1.5 T
MR system (Avanto, Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Ger￾many); the T2-map calculation algorithm was imple￾mented in MATLAB (The Mathworks Inc., Natick, MA,
USA.). In all hypotheses testing, a p-value < 0.05 was con￾Table 1: Previously published in-vivo human myocardial T2 values.

sidered statistically significant. All analyses were per￾formed using MINITAB statistical software package
(Minitab Inc., State College PA, USA.).
T2-prepared SSFP pulse sequence
A T2-prepared steady-state free precession sequence [15]
was used to generate three T2W images, one each with dif￾ferent T2 preparation times (TET2P = 0 ms, 24 ms, 55 ms).
Table 2 lists the imaging parameters. Because these images
are acquired in the transient state of single-shot SSFP
immediately after the T2 preparation pulse, the primary
source of contrast is the T2 relaxation time. Thus, the sig￾nal in each image represents a different echo time along
the T2 decay curve.
The T2-prepared single-shot SSFP sequence was similar to
that described by Huang et al. [16]. The T2 preparation
scheme (T2p) was identical to that described in an earlier
work [18]. The design incorporates non-selective compos￾ite pulses for insensitivity to motion and B0 and B1 inho￾mogeneities. The SSFP readout module was applied
immediately after the T2p to sample the magnetization
prior to reaching the SSFP steady state. Prior work [19,20]
has suggested steady-state preparation schemes to reduce
the oscillations that occur in the transient state of SSFP
due to off-resonance, and the linear flip angle (LFA)
approach was shown to have a superior performance in
the presence of large off-resonance frequencies [19]. We
thus chose the LFA scheme with 10 steps to stabilize the
transient oscillations. Both linear and centric ordered
acquisitions of k-space data were evaluated.
T2 maps were generated by fitting the following two￾parameter equation to corresponding pixels from each of
the three images:
where S(x, y) is signal intensity, M0(x, y) is a lumped
parameter that includes the equilibrium magnetization
and local receiver coil gain, and TET2P is the T2 preparation
time. The above equation was fit using a linear 2-parame￾ter model after logarithmic transformation. To minimize
breath-hold duration (and thus patient discomfort), we
limited the number of TET2P times to three, the minimum
required for a linear least-squares fit. A wait time of 2 RR
intervals was inserted between images to allow for suffi￾cient relaxation; thus, a total of 7 RR intervals were
required to acquire the three T2p images. The sequence
timing was adjusted for each T2p time to ensure that the
SSFP readout was always timed to the same phase of the
cardiac cycle. The entire scheme (image acquisition + T2
map generation) is depicted in Figure 1.
The TET2P times (0 ms, 24 ms, and 55 ms) were chosen
based on the expected range of T2 values in the myocar￾dium. Recent work (see Table 1) has shown that the T2 for
normal myocardium is approximately 55 ms; accordingly,
we chose the longest TET2P to be 55 ms because longer
TET2P would cause significant signal loss. The recent paper
by Blume et al. [17] showed that myocardial T2 estima￾tion was improved by including an image without T2
preparation (TET2P = 0 ms). TET2P = 24 ms was the mini￾mum time permitted by the preparation scheme and was
chosen as an intermediate point on the curve to support a
least-squares fit.
Phantom study
Phantom studies were performed to evaluate the accuracy
of the T2p-SSFP method. Phantoms were prepared using
two different mixtures of NiCl2 and agar [21] to approxi￾mate the T1 and T2 values of normal (T1/T2 = 1081/51
ms) and edematous (T1/T2 = 1223/62 ms) myocardium
[14]. The T1 values were verified using an inversion recov￾ery spin echo sequence with eighteen TI times ranging
from 22 to 3000 ms; the T2 values were verified using a S x y M x y exp TE T x y T P ( , ) ( , ) ( / ( , )) = − 0 2 2

spin echo sequence with thirteen TE times ranging from
11 to 143 ms. Both spin echo protocols used a TR of 10
seconds to allow for complete recovery of longitudinal
magnetization and the scan time per image was approxi￾mately 17 minutes. Both T1 and T2 were fit using Leven￾berg-Marquardt non-linear least squares method. T2p￾SSFP was run using both linear and centric k-space order￾ing to evaluate the performance of each. All phantom
studies were performed with a simulated heart rate of 60
beats per min (bpm). Different wait times (2 through 5
RR) between TET2P images were compared to evaluate the
influence of T1 recovery on the accuracy of the T2 maps.
The phantom T2's were also measured using a conven￾tional multi-echo turbo spin echo (MESE) approach to
compare it's accuracy with T2p-SSFP. Two MESE protocols
were used: 2 echoes (TE = 4.4, 53 ms) and 3 echoes (TE =
4.4, 44, 84 ms) (see Table 2 for imaging parameters).
In-vivo Measurements
With the insights gained from phantom studies, six
healthy volunteers were studied first to evaluate the differ￾ences between linear and centric ordering of the T2p-SSFP
acquisition. Thereafter, the chosen k-space ordering
scheme was used to investigate the in-vivo T2 of human
myocardium in seventeen healthy subjects. Three pigs
with verified acute myocardial infarction and three
patients, also with acute myocardial infarction, were
scanned to investigate the ability of the T2p-SSFP tech￾nique to detect myocardial edema. All twenty three
healthy subjects (18-33 years old) and three patients
(ages: 55, 66, 79 years) gave written informed consent to
participate in this HIPAA-compliant study approved by
the institution's Human Subjects Committee; the animal
study was approved by the Institutional Laboratory Ani￾mal Care and Use Committee.

Healthy Subjects
Linear and centric k-space ordering were compared in six
healthy subjects. A mid-ventricular short-axis (SAX) slice
was scanned in each subject using both k-space orderings.
The resulting mean T2 values and mean spatial T2 varia￾tion were compared. Coefficient of variation was used as
a measure of spatial variation.
In fourteen additional normal subjects the following
slices were imaged: 3 SAX at basal, mid and apical levels
of left ventricle, horizontal long axis (HLA) and vertical
long axis (VLA). The imaging parameters are described in
Table 2; linear ordering of k-space was used. The images
were segmented into 16 standard myocardial sectors [22]
(6 basal sectors, 6 mid-ventricular, and 4 apical) for quan￾titative T2 analysis. Apical sectors from HLA and VLA
views were used in four cases in which partial volume
effects made it difficult to mark the myocardial borders in
the apical SAX slice.
Using these data (n = 224 segments, 16 for each of the 14
subjects), inter-subject and spatial variability were
assessed as described in following paragraphs.
ANOVA was performed to test inter-subject T2 variability.
To test for spatial variability of T2 in the short-axis images
from the 14 subjects (16 segments per subject, total n =
224 segments), the data was first adjusted against inter￾subject variability by subtracting the mean T2 of the sub￾ject from the segment T2 values; variance of T2 across sub￾jects was assumed to be equal. ANOVA was performed to
test the hypothesis of equal mean among the 16 segments.
Coefficient of variation was used as a measure of variabil￾ity. Additionally, a simple linear regression was per￾formed to check for correlation between T2 and RR
interval to investigate the influence of heart rate on T2
measurement. To test for differences in T2 calculated from
short-axis or long-axis views, the four mid-ventricular seg￾ments that are represented in short-axis, HLA (inferosep￾tal and anterolateral), and VLA (anterior and inferior)
views were used. Paired t-test was performed to assess dif￾ferences. Additionally, to provide a measure of variability
at pixel level, spatial variation of T2 was computed across
all pixels in the mid-ventricular slice for each subject.
To study the effect of spatially-variant coil sensitivity on
T2 maps, we separately acquired T2p-SSFP images for a
single mid-ventricular SAX slice in each subject and gener￾ated T2 maps for comparison with T2W images acquired
using the triple inversion recovery STIR sequence [10].
Only anterior coil elements were used to create a signifi￾cant signal gradient from anterior to posterior myocardial
regions. In each T2W image and T2 map, the six standard
myocardial segments were evaluated for spatial variability
after normalization by the segment with the minimum
value. Coefficient of variation in these normalized seg￾ments was used as a measure of spatial variation.
To compare the motion sensitivity of T2W and T2 map￾ping techniques, a short axis slice was imaged close to the
base in six of the subjects (three of the previous fourteen
subjects + three new subjects). Two scans were run for
each technique to acquire images at two cardiac phases:
(i) 400 ms after the R-wave and (ii) mid-diastole; matched
ROIs were drawn in the lateral wall of the four images thus
acquired. Paired t-test was used to test the hypothesis of
no difference in signal intensity (T2W) or T2 (T2 Map)
between the images acquired at two different points in the
cardiac cycle.
Animals
Acute myocardial infarction was induced in three pigs to
determine whether significant changes in measured T2
could be detected. The animals were anesthetized with
ketamine (7.5 mg/lb) and acepromazine (0.25 mg/lb). A
catheter was then guided under x-ray fluoroscopy via the
femoral artery. Thereafter, a balloon occluder was guided
through the catheter to the left anterior descending (LAD)
coronary artery just distal to the first diagonal branch.
Once in place, the occluder was inflated to produce total
LAD occlusion to induce ischemia. The occlusion was
maintained for 90 minutes to induce infarction following
which the balloon was deflated. MRI was performed 3
days after reperfusion. During the scan, anesthesia was
maintained using isoflurane in oxygen (1-3%) and
mechanical ventilation (20 mmHg). ECG, blood pressure
and pulse oximetry were monitored throughout the exper￾imental period.
T2 maps were acquired in each animal in one mid-ven￾tricular short-axis slice that included the affected LAD ter￾ritory. This was followed by an injection of gadolinium￾diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA, Magnev￾ist, Bayer Health Care Pharmaceuticals) and Late Gadolin￾ium Enhancement (LGE) imaging [23] to evaluate the
extent of myocardial infarction. One-sided t-test was used
to assess whether the T2 in the anterior segment (LAD ter￾ritory) was significantly higher than that in the remote
inferior segment.
Patients
Three adult patients with acute myocardial infarction
(AMI) were studied to gain insights into the potential clin￾ical applications of this technique. Since the purpose of
this study was only intended to evaluate the feasibility of
myocardial T2 mapping, the inclusion criteria were
restricted to patients with documented cases of AMI based
on electrocardiography, x-ray coronary angiography, and
cardiac biomarkers. Table 3 describes the clinical charac￾teristic of each patient. MRI was performed on day 2 fol-

lowing the onset of symptoms. For edema imaging, both
STIR and T2 maps were acquired. Edematous myocardial
segments were defined from the results of coronary angi￾ography and were compared with remote segments in
both STIR images and T2 maps.
Results
Phantom study
Tables 4 and 5 summarize the results from the phantom
study. All sequences overestimated T2, although MESE
resulted in the largest and T2p-SSFP with centric k-space
ordering in the least overestimation (Table 4).
Table 5 lists the results from the second phantom experi￾ment to study the effect of the time interval between TET2P
image acquisitions.
Volunteer Results
Images acquired using centric reordering demonstrated
artifacts in the blood pool and myocardium (Figure 2).
These artifacts may be due to the initial transient oscilla￾tions caused by off-resonance frequencies affecting the
central lines of k-space. Figure 2 shows images and T2
maps from one subject; the artifacts in centric reordered
images caused regional heterogeneity in measured T2 val￾ues that could compromise diagnostic accuracy. Images
acquired using linear ordering did not demonstrate such
artifacts and the corresponding T2 maps were quite
homogenous. The mean T2 values across these six subjects
using the two methods were: 50.7 ± 2.4 ms for linear and
46.1 ± 3.5 ms for centric. The mean spatial variation with
linear ordering was 4.2%, whereas that with centric order￾ing was 6.3%. In light of the better image quality and less
variation of T2 maps, linear ordering was used for all sub￾sequent studies in human subjects and in the animal
model.
The mean T2 value averaged across all 16 segments and
among all 14 healthy subjects was found to be 52.18 ± 3.4
ms (range: 48.96 ms to 55.67 ms). ANOVA test for inter￾subject variability of T2 values revealed statistically signif￾icant differences (p-value < 0.001). This variability
showed no linear correlation with heart rate (R2 = 0.018).
The average coefficient of variation of T2 across subjects
was 5.3%. Figure 3 shows the 95% CI for each of the 16
segments, suggesting that most of the variability was com￾ing from the apical regions. ANOVA test for the basal and
mid-ventricular segments showed no variation among
these 12 segments results (p-value = 0.239). The mean
spatial T2 variation for this subset of 12 segments was
3.8%. The T2 values computed from short-axis versus
long-axis views in mid-ventricular segments did not show
any significant variation (p-value = 0.319).
For the mid-ventricular SAX slice from fourteen subjects,
the mean spatial variation expressed as coefficient of vari￾ation of the pixels was 8.7% ± 1.1%; the average number
pixels per slice was 113.
Figure 4A depicts the spatial variation in the 6 mid-ven￾tricular myocardial segments for T2 maps and T2W
images acquired in both cases using only anterior coil ele￾ments (averaged among 14 subjects). T2W images consist￾ently showed higher signal for the anterior segment as
compared to the inferior segment (p-value < 0.001; paired
t-test). T2 maps did not show any such trend (p-value =
0.414; paired t-test), providing uniform signal in all myo￾cardial segments. Figure 4-B summarizes the coefficient of
variation for all the subjects. The mean coefficient of vari￾ation was 27.7% for T2W and 4.25% for T2 Maps.

T2W and T2 Map. Note the near complete dropout of

myocardial signal due to through-plane motion in T2W
imaging when the image was acquired 400 ms after the R￾wave; T2 Map, on the other hand, showed consistent
results at each cardiac phase. In the six subjects, T2W
imaging showed statistically significant difference in sig￾nal intensity (p-value = 0.002) in the lateral wall of images
acquired at different cardiac phases whereas T2 map did
not show any difference in T2 values (p-value = 0.86).
Animal Results
The T2 maps in all animals showed a significantly higher
T2 in the anterior segment associated with the occluded
LAD segment compared with a remote inferior wall seg￾ment (for each animal, p-value < 0.001; one-sided t-test).
In two pigs the necrotic tissue as shown by LGE matched
the regions of T2 enhancement. The third animal died just
before the injection of contrast agent and hence the LGE
images were not available. Figure 6 and Table 6 summa￾rize the results from the pig studies. While histological
data was not available for these animals, 90 minutes of
LAD occlusion is sufficient to cause infarction [24], as ver￾ified in two of the three animals by LGE.
Patient Results

The T2 measured in the basal inferior regions in both
views was significantly higher than the remote (basal
anterior) region. This increased T2 in inferior region was
undetectable in the STIR image, its contrast possibly com￾promised by the surface coil sensitivity inhomogeneity.

Note also in the STIR VLA images the high signal from
stagnant blood pool that makes it difficult to mark the
endocardial border. These artifacts were not an issue in T2
maps. The LGE images confirm the localization of infarct.
Discussion
The sensitivity of T2W imaging to myocardial edema was
first reported by Higgins [1] over 25 years ago, and several
improvements on the original gated T2W spin echo
sequence have been made since that time [10,14,15,25].
However, a variety of technical limitations including sensi￾tivity to myocardial motion, surface coil intensity variation,
high sub-endocardial signal from static blood, and the sub￾jective nature of image interpretation have restricted the abil￾ity to confidently discern true myocardial T2 hyper-intensity
with T2W imaging. This study demonstrated a rapid and
practical technique for quantitative T2 mapping that
addresses these limitations associated with conventional
T2W imaging, and offers a potentially more reliable method
for detection of myocardial edema.
Motion Sensitivity
The sensitivity of myocardial signal to motion has been an
inherent limitation of techniques such as T2W TSE and

STIR imaging where cardiac motion can result in reduced
myocardial signal (Figure 5); this problem is often
observed in the highly mobile basal short axis plane [26].
The T2 preparation used in this work is non-selective, ren￾dering this technique less sensitive to myocardial signal
wash-out than turbo spin echo based methods. This was
shown in normal volunteers where T2 values were unaf￾fected by the location of the acquisition window in car￾diac cycle, while myocardial signal in T2W STIR was
significantly affected. Additionally, the single-shot SSFP
readout is much less sensitive to artifacts induced by car￾diac arrhythmias or imperfect breath-hold than seg￾mented k-space methods.
Surface Coil Intensity Variation
Variability in myocardial signal in T2W imaging can also
result from surface coil intensity inhomogeneity, another
important factor limiting the applicability of myocardial
edema imaging. Results obtained under conditions of
severe surface coil signal inhomogeneity showed that T2
mapping reduced the mean coefficient of variation among
myocardial segments from 27.7% with T2W STIR, to
4.25% in the T2 maps (Figures 4A and 4B); the same level
of variation is observed in T2 maps acquired using com￾bined anterior and posterior elements. Attempts have
been made [7,27] to compensate for surface coil inhomo￾geneities by using a large, single-element body-coil
receiver; however, this approach comes with a SNR pen￾alty [11] and an increase in scan time as parallel acquisi￾tion techniques cannot be used. Alternatively, coil
intensity correction algorithms have been proposed
[14,15] but have not yet been evaluated in clinical studies.
T2 mapping solves this critical problem that will gain sig￾nificance as the number of array coil elements increases to
facilitate faster imaging.
Stagnant Blood
Another significant problem recognized even in the first
papers on in-vivo T2W imaging of the human heart
[28,29] is sub-endocardial bright signal artifact caused by
stagnant blood. Direct quantification of T2 easily distin￾guishes blood from myocardium [29], within the spatial
resolution limits of the sequence. While a formal study of
this artifact was not possible, we noted in the patient
images the presence of high signal in endocardial blood
(Figure 6). This was not observed in the T2 maps,
although as mentioned earlier, partial volume effects in
short-axis apical slices can artificially elevate the T2 in
those segments.
Advantages of Quantification
Yet another advantage of T2 mapping over T2W imaging
is that it is a quantitative method. Most clinical studies
using T2W imaging to date have relied on subjective visual
assessment to detect regions of relative T2 signal hyperin￾tensity [6,7]. Such an approach is purely qualitative and
image interpretation can be challenging, particularly in
the presence of the aforementioned artifacts and signal
variability. The broad range of historical T2 values (Table
1) suggests that T2 estimation depends on methodology;

In each animal, T2 in the infarcted segment was significantly higher (p-value < 0.001) than the T2 of the remote viable segment.

with a near complete myocardial signal dropout. T2 map 
(bottom row) showed consistent results in both cardiac 
phases and demonstrated insensitivity to cardiac motion. 
Note that these images are from a more mobile basal slice 
and the images in left column were deliberately acquired in a 
highly dynamic cardiac phase to demonstrate insensitivity of 
T2 Maps to motion.

however, defining the expected range of myocardial T2
values in normal subjects for a given technique enables it
to be used to quantitatively asses abnormalities [9]. While
our preliminary results in a small sample population did
indicate significant inter-subject myocardial T2 variabil￾ity, this was not correlated with heart rate, indicating that
variable relaxation of magnetization between acquisitions
was not the cause. Indeed, the phantom study demon￾strated the robustness of the protocol over a range of wait
times between TET2P images (two through five RR inter￾vals). There is evidence that myocardial T2 may vary
depending on the recent health status of the individual. A
recent study in high-endurance athletes suffering from
common cold virus [30] showed evidence of myocardial
edema and inflammation, both of which increased at four
week follow-up. Although the normal subjects that partic￾ipated in our study were healthy and free from any history
of cardiovascular disease, we did not record information
regarding ongoing or recent medical conditions such as
recent infections. In addition, studies on skeletal muscle
[31,32] have suggested activity-dependent changes in T2.
Although similar changes have not been demonstrated in
myocardium, the possibility of this effect cannot be ruled
out.
Quantification of T2 offers a distinct advantage over T2W
imaging in the detection of global changes in myocar￾dium as may be expected to occur in myocarditis [27] or
cardiac allograft rejection [9]. A recent published white
paper [8] recommends the use of a CMR protocol that
includes T2W imaging as part of a comprehensive diag￾nostic approach in patients with suspected myocarditis. In
such cases, T2W techniques that rely on regional differ￾ences in myocardial signal may fail, whereas T2 mapping
will facilitate detection of global or diffuse changes in
myocardium. Additionally, T2 mapping will enable accu￾rate monitoring of the treatment and/or progression of
disease.
Limitations
While our human myocardial T2 results concurred with
previously published work (Table 1), phantom results
showed an overestimation of T2 values; we identified two
probable causes of this inaccuracy.
First, the k-space ordering chosen for SSFP readout was
linear instead of centric despite the higher T2 accuracy in
phantoms provided by the latter. However, as shown in
Figure 2, centric ordering gave rise to artifacts in the in vivo
images, possibly due to the oscillatory approach to steady￾state having a stronger effect on the central k-space lines.
Images and T2 maps acquired using linear ordering did
not show this artifact and demonstrated significantly less
spatial variation in calculated T2. The overestimation in
T2 with linear ordering was likely caused by the acquisi￾tion of central k-space lines after the T2p magnetization
has been perturbed by a number of RF excitation pulses
and the signal has begun to approach SSFP steady-state.

A second probable cause of T2 overestimation may be the
number of echo times and fitting method used. Given that
our mono-exponential model has two parameters (Mo
and T2) we chose to use three images for the T2 calcula￾tion as the minimum required for a least-squares linear￾regression fitting of the logarithmically transformed data
to minimize breath-hold times. A recent work by Sparrow
et al. [33] demonstrated the feasibility of this approach.
The effect of noise and its propagation into the T2 map
through the linear least-squares fitting process has not
been analyzed in this study, but the procedure would be
similar to the one described by MacFall et al. [34]. While
the use of additional echoes may provide robustness to a
non-linear fit, it would increase the breath-hold time and
patient discomfort. The single shot SSFP readout and use
of only three TET2P times ensures the breath-hold time
(7RR) is within the capabilities of most of the patients.
There is still the potential for mis-registration between
images causing error in the T2 maps. If breath-holding is
not feasible, the sequence could be combined with respi￾ratory triggering and/or image registration methods could
be applied prior to T2-map calculation. Although a
recently described T2W imaging technique [15] used a
motion correction algorithm prior to averaging to
enhance SNR, this was accomplished using rigid-body
registration of multiple images of identical contrast. In
this study the T2p times, and hence the contrasts, of the
three images were different; consequently it is unknown
how this or other motion correction algorithms would
perform.
The analyses of T2 variability between myocardial seg￾ments showed no statistically significant differences
among the twelve basal and mid-ventricular segments;
however, our results suggest a consistent overestimation
of T2 in the four apical segments (Figure 3). One potential
reason for this effect could be the inclusion of cavity
blood in apical segments due to partial volume effects
caused by the tissue geometry, although this theory was
not explored in detail. Excluding the apical sectors
reduced the mean spatial T2 variation from 5.3% to 3.8%.
To reduce partial volume effects, one may either use thin￾ner slices, or HLA and VLA views to measure T2 in the api￾cal segments. The feasibility of this second approach is
supported by the results showing that T2 maps from mid￾ventricular short-axis and long-axis views demonstrated
no significant difference.
Conclusions
Detection of myocardial edema is not possible by other
cardiac imaging modalities, and the lack of a robust CMR

approach has limited broad application of this potentially
important measure of myocardial status. This work has
demonstrated an accurate, fast, quantitative approach to
detect the elevated T2 associated with myocardial edema
that successfully addresses the well-known limitations of
T2W imaging. Further studies are warranted to evaluate
the clinical applicability of this technique in the range of
conditions that are known to globally or regionally affect
myocardial water content.
