Abstract
Objectives To assess the impact on clinical management of
introducing 18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) positron
emission tomography (PET)-computed tomography (CT) in
to the work-up of patients with primary and recurrent biliary
malignancy.
Methods Consecutive patients with primary biliary tumours
undergoing FDG PET-CT at a single large tertiary referral
centre between November 2007 and September 2010 were
retrospectively analysed. Findings on FDG PET-CT com￾pared with CT/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and im￾pact on subsequent patient management were evaluated.
Impact was divided into: (1) major—detection of occult
disease or characterisation of indeterminate lesion(s) on
CT/MRI; (2) minor—confirmation of suspected metastases
seen on CT/MRI; (3) no impact.
Results One hundred and eleven patients underwent 118
FDG PET-CT scans, including 30 with suspected gallbladder
carcinoma and 81 with cholangiocarcinoma. Eighty-nine
scans were performed for initial staging, five for restaging
following neoadjuvant chemotherapy and 24 for suspected
disease recurrence. In 33 cases (28 %), FDG PET-CT had a
major impact on subsequent patient management (39 % gall￾bladder carcinoma, 26 % intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma
and 21 % extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma). FDG PET-CT
had a minor impact in 20 cases (17 %) and no impact in 65
cases (55 %).
Conclusions By detecting occult metastatic disease and
characterising indeterminate lesions, FDG PET-CT can have
a major influence on clinical decision-making in primary and
recurrent biliary malignancy.

Introduction
Primary neoplasms of the biliary system are a heterogeneous
group largely comprising of gallbladder carcinoma and chol￾angiocarcinoma with a few other much rarer tumours. Tra￾ditionally these tumours have a high mortality rate, with
surgical excision being the mainstay of long-term survival
[1]. Advances in surgery have increased the likelihood of
achieving local disease control and now limited distant
spread may also be considered for resection. Accurate stag￾ing is critical for this to occur, not only to aid surgical
planning but also to prevent unnecessary surgical interven￾tion in those with advanced disease.
Despite pre-operative assessment with traditional cross￾sectional imaging techniques, up to a third of patients with
primary biliary malignancy still undergo unnecessary

laparotomy [2]. The main contraindications to resectability
found at surgery are occult peritoneal and liver metastases,
and, less commonly, vascular and lymph node invasion [3, 4].
These may not be detected due to inability of conventional
imaging modalities (computed tomography [CT]/magnetic
resonance imaging [MRI]) to accurately distinguish between
benign and malignant processes based on size or anatomical
criteria alone or when prior intervention distorts normal anat￾omy. Gallbladder carcinoma in particular is associated with
more frequent early dissemination, whereas cholangiocarci￾noma is likely to be locally invasive and has a slightly longer
survival [2].
18F-Fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) integrated positron
emission tomography (PET)-computed tomography (CT) is
a non-invasive imaging technique that allows in vivo assess￾ment of the metabolic processes underlying malignant disease.
It has been shown to be more accurate than CT/MRI in the
assessment of several primary and recurrent tumours, includ￾ing colorectal, lung and oesophageal cancer [5–7]. Moreover,
it is reported to have a consistent impact on intended manage￾ment that is not restricted to cancer type [8]. By providing
additional functional information and in the correct setting,
FDG PET-CT can allow earlier detection of tumours, identifi￾cation of occult metastatic disease, characterisation of indeter￾minate lesions, assessment of therapeutic response and overall
more accurate staging for potential resection.
Several previous studies have assessed the ability of FDG
PET-CT to detect primary biliary tumours; however, few
report its overall efficacy in the management pathway of
patients with primary biliary malignancy. The aim of this
study was to assess the impact on clinical management of
introducing FDG PET-CT in to the work-up of patients with
potentially resectable primary biliary malignancy and in those
undergoing FDG PET-CT for response assessment following
chemotherapy or with suspected disease recurrence.
Materials and methods
Patients
Consecutive patients with primary biliary tumours undergoing
FDG PET-CT at a single large tertiary referral centre over a
35-month period were retrospectively analysed (November
2007 to September 2010). Formal ethics committee approval
was not required at our institution for a case review of this
kind. Data were accessed from the institutional radiology
information system (CRIS; Healthcare Software Systems,
Banbury, UK) and Patient Pathway Manager (PPM, Leeds,
UK; an electronic patient record system). Referral for FDG
PET-CTwas made on a case-by-case basis after discussion at a
specialist multidisciplinary team (MDT) meeting. The main
indication for performing FDG PET-CT was for initial staging
to determine suitability for surgical resection where there was
some ambiguity on initial conventional imaging. The other
indications were for restaging following neoadjuvant chemo￾therapy and for suspected disease recurrence. Patients with
locally advanced disease or distant metastatic disease that was
deemed unresectable on conventional imaging were referred
for palliative chemotherapy where appropriate.
Imaging
Imaging was retrospectively reviewed independently by two
experienced radiologists. Both readers are dual trained in
Radiology and Nuclear Medicine and respectively have
13/11 years of experience in CT and MRI and 9/7 years of
experience in PET-CT. Prior radiology reports were subse￾quently reviewed but not at the time of image analysis.
Imaging, particularly that performed externally, was validat￾ed and accepted as consistent for diagnosis at time of MDT
review. If imaging was deemed suboptimal for diagnosis,
then it was repeated at our institution. Any discrepancies
were discussed in order to reach a consensus view.
Imaging for each patient was retrieved from the institu￾tional picture archiving and communications system (PACS)
(IMPAX; AGFA Healthcare, Mortsel, Belgium). Contrast￾enhanced CT (CECT) thorax/abdomen/pelvis was per￾formed in 76 cases. The mean time between the previous
CECT and the PET-CT was 38 days (range 1–125 days,
lower quartile 22 days and upper quartile 46 days). Most
cases were scanned within a 90-day period with only four, all
cholangiocarcinomas, scanned outside this time. CECT was
performed at our institution (n=57) after referral from the
regional oncology team on either a 16- or 64-slice scanner
(Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany) using a contigu￾ous 3-mm reconstruction and following a bolus of 100 ml
iodinated contrast medium (Omnipaque 300 mg I/ml; GE
Healthcare, Oslo, Norway). The remaining CTs had been
acquired at one of several referring hospitals on a range of
different scanner types using similar acquisition parameters
(n=18).
Liver MRI was performed in 72 cases. The mean time
between the previous MRI and the PET-CT was 15 days
(range 1–88 days, lower quartile 3 days and upper quartile
21 days). MRI was performed at our institution in 67 of the 72
cases on a 1.5-T system (Symphony/Avanto; Siemens
Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany) using a body phased array
coil and a breath-holding technique. T1/T2/T2*-weighted se￾quences were obtained with the use of intravenous gadolinium
(Gadovist; Bayer Healthcare Pharmaceuticals, Berlin, Germa￾ny) and, where appropriate, liver-specific contrast agents
(Resovist prior to its withdrawal in 2009 and Primovist there￾after; Bayer Healthcare Pharmaceuticals, Berlin, Germany).
Diffusion-weighted imaging was also performed for each case
with b values of 50, 200, 500 and 750 s/mm2
.

PET-CT scans were performed prior to 1st June 2010 on a
16-slice Discovery STE PET-CT scanner (GE Healthcare,
Amersham, UK), and thereafter on a 64-slice Philips Gemini
TF64 scanner (Philips Healthcare, Amsterdam, Netherlands),
60 min following a 400-MBq dose of intravenous FDG.
Images were acquired from the skull base to upper thigh.
The CT component of the PET-CT was performed according
to a standardised protocol with the following settings: 140 kV;
80 mAs; tube rotation time 0.5 s per rotation; pitch 6; section
thickness 3.75 mm (to match PET section thickness). Patients
were asked to maintain normal shallow respiration during CT
acquisition. No iodinated contrast material was administered.
Imaging was reviewed on specialised PET-CT workstations
(XD3; Mirada Medical, Oxford, UK).
Analysis of clinical impact
The clinical impact of FDG PET-CT on the management of
patients was evaluated using the institutional oncological elec￾tronic patient record system (Patient Pathway Manager),
which prospectively documents MDT decisions based on
discussion between medical and radiation oncologists, sur￾geons, radiologists and pathologists. Information was also
obtained from the institution’s radiology information system
(CRIS). Follow-up information was obtained for a minimum
12-month period subsequent to the date of the PET-CT scan.
All PET-CT findings were correlated with the results of histo￾logical, radiological and clinical follow-up. A hypermetabolic
FDG lesion was considered truly positive for involvement if
malignancy was proven by histological analysis or if the lesion
progressed on follow-up imaging or resolved after therapy. An
FDG-negative lesion was considered truly negative if its size
remained stable on imaging follow-up.
The impact of FDG PET-CT in addition to CT/MRI find￾ings on the management of patients was assessed with re￾spect to potential change of management by either the iden￾tification of distant unresectable disease or confirmation of
its absence. Three categories of impact were considered:
Major impact:
& Evidence of unresectable metastatic disease on FDG
PET-CT, which was either indeterminate or evaded de￾tection on prior CT/MRI.
& Additional FDG PET-CT findings that would extend the
surgical field.
& FDG PET-CT characterisation of indeterminate lesions on
CT/MRI as benign, allowing curative resection to be
attempted.
Minor impact:
& FDG PET-CT confirmation of suspicious unresectable
findings on CT/MRI.
No impact:
& No additional findings on FDG PET-CT compared with
CT/MRI.
& Indeterminate findings on FDG PET-CT which did not
alter the status of the patient with regards to resectability.
If findings on FDG PET-CT fell into both a minor impact
and a major impact category then overall the impact was
considered as major.
Results
In total, 111 patients underwent 118 FDG PET-CT scans (45
men, 66 women). Mean patient age was 65 years (range 24–
87, lower quartile 58 and upper quartile 73). There were 30
patients with suspected gallbladder carcinoma and 81 with
cholangiocarcinoma (47 intra-hepatic, 34 extra-hepatic).
Eighty-nine scans were performed for initial staging (Table 1),
five scans for restaging following chemotherapy prior to con￾sideration of radical surgery and 24 scans for assessment of
suspected disease recurrence (Table 2).
The majority of patients underwent initial staging with
CECT thorax/abdomen/pelvis with or without MRI. A mi￾nority only underwent MRI of the upper abdomen prior to
PET-CT; however, in none of these patients did PET-CT
have an impact by finding disease outside of the imaging
field performed for MRI.
Overall, FDG PET-CT had a major impact on subsequent
patient management in 33 cases (28 %). This consisted of
39 % (n=12) of gallbladder carcinomas, 26 % (n=14) of
intra-hepatic cholangiocarcinomas and 21 % (n=7) of extra￾hepatic cholangiocarcinomas. Eleven of these patients had
occult metastatic disease: sites included liver (n=4), perito￾neum (n=6) and bone (n=1). There were seven cases of
unsuspected lymph node involvement; four unsuspected
lymph node involvement and peritoneal disease; two
unsuspected liver metastases and lymph node involvement;
two were found to have unsuspected synchronous primary
cancers. In a further seven patients, FDG PET-CT clarified
indeterminate lesions seen on cross-sectional imaging as
either malignant (n=2) or benign (n=5). FDG PET-CT had
a minor impact in 17 % of cases (20/118) and no impact in
55 % of cases (65/118). These results are summarised in
Table 3, with a breakdown of the impact of FDG PET-CT
performed for initial staging versus suspected disease
recurrence.
Gallbladder carcinoma
Thirty patients with suspected gallbladder carcinoma underwent
a total of 31 FDG PET-CT scans. Twenty-seven were performed
for initial staging and four for suspected disease recurrence.
Insights Imaging (2013) 4:691–700 693

FDG PET-CT had a major impact on patient management
in 39 % of cases (12/31), including finding disease recurrence
in two, characterising indeterminate peritoneal nodules as
benign in one, and finding new disease sites in seven (retro￾peritoneal lymph node involvement n=1; lymph node and
liver/peritoneal metastases n=2 (Fig. 1); liver/peritoneal me￾tastases n=4). Synchronous primary cancers were found inci￾dentally in two patients (gastric and rectal). Overall, FDG
PET-CT upstaged 26 % (7/27) of the scans performed for
initial staging and downstaged a further 4 % (1/27).
FDG PET-CT had a minor impact on patient management
in 6 % of cases (2/31) by confirming the presence of suspicious
unresectable peritoneal disease in one case and liver metastases
in the other, as suspected on CT/MRI. FDG PET-CT had no
impact on patient management in the remaining 55 % of cases
(17/31).
FDG PET-CT was falsely negative in three cases for peri￾toneal involvement that was later found at surgery.
FDG PET-CT was falsely positive in one patient with a
suspected malignant gallbladder mass, where the final his￾tology showed xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis only.
Of the 26 confirmed gallbladder carcinomas, only 15
remained in situ at time of PET-CT. All showed uptake of
FDG (SUV mean 15.2, range 4.0–38.4; sensitivity 100 %).
Cholangiocarcinoma
Eighty-one patients with suspected cholangiocarcinoma (47
intra-hepatic, 34 extra-hepatic) underwent a total of 87 FDG
PET-CT scans. Sixty-two scans were performed for initial
staging (39 intra-hepatic, 23 extra-hepatic), 20 for suspected
disease recurrence (9 intra-hepatic, 11 extra-hepatic) and 5
for restaging following chemotherapy prior to consideration
of radical surgery (4 intra-hepatic, 1 extra-hepatic).
FDG PET-CT had a major impact on patient management
in 24 % of cases (21/87). Of these, 26 % were intra-hepatic

(14/54) and 21 % extra-hepatic (7/33). FDG PET-CT found
disease recurrence at sites not suspected on CT/MRI (n=5)
and characterised four indeterminate lesions as malignant
(pulmonary nodule n=1) or benign (pulmonary nodule
n=1; peritoneal nodule n=1; peritoneal haziness/lymph node
enlargement in a case of suspected recurrence n=1). FDG
PET-CT confirmed response to chemotherapy in a patient
with a large intra-hepatic cholangiocarcinoma and a bone
metastasis that was unsuspected on CT/MRI (Fig. 2). FDG
PET-CT found new disease sites in 11 (lymph node involve￾ment n=6; liver and lymph node involvement n=1; perito￾neal disease n=2; lymph node involvement and peritoneal
disease n=1 [Fig 3]; bone metastasis n=1). Overall, FDG
PET-CT upstaged 19 % (12/62) and downstaged 3 % (2/62)
of the scans performed for initial staging (downstaged one
peritoneal deposit and one pulmonary nodule, both in intra￾hepatic cholangiocarcinomas).
FDG PET-CT had a minor impact on patient management
in 21 % of cases (18/87) by confirming suspicious
unresectable findings seen on CT/MRI (9/54 of intra-hepatic
and 9/33 of extra-hepatic cholangiocarcinomas). FDG PET￾CT had no impact on patient management in the remaining
55 % of cases (48/87).
FDG PET-CT was falsely negative in five cases. The first
was a patient with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and a
suspicious right liver mass on surveillance MRI, later con￾firmed to be a well-differentiated cholangiocarcinoma (no
mucinous differentiation on histology). FDG PET-CT was
also falsely negative in another PSC patient where CECT
showed a filling defect in the distal CBD associated with
biliary dilatation; surgery was undertaken based on the CECT
findings and post-operative histology confirmed two small
foci of cholangiocarcinoma measuring 8 mm and 13 mm.
FDG PET-CT was falsely negative for peritoneal disease in a
patient with an FDG-avid intra-hepatic cholangiocarcinoma
and in two patients with extra-hepatic cholangiocarcinomas
(both primary tumours were also FDG negative).
FDG PET-CT was falsely positive in one patient found to
have a hilar mass on MRI. FDG PET-CT showed uptake in
the liver, mesenteric nodes and peritoneal deposits thought to

represent disseminated malignancy. However, the patient
had cholangitis with bile leak at the time of FDG PET-CT,
as confirmed on subsequent staging laparoscopy.
FDG PET-CT was indeterminate in two cases, one with
several enlarged lymph nodes showing low grade uptake and
the other with mild FDG activity in a trace of pelvic free fluid.
Fourteen of the 62 confirmed primary cholangiocarcinomas
were FDG negative on PET-CT, with an overall sensitivity of
77 %. Three of 39 intra-hepatic cholangiocarcinomas (SUV
mean 14.4, range 3.7–45.8) and 11 of 23 extra-hepatic chol￾angiocarcinoma (SUV mean 6.9, range 4.4–18.5) were FDG
negative, giving sensitivities of 92 % and 52 % respectively.
With regards to tumour morphology, 15 of the 62 con￾firmed primary cholangiocarcinomas were of the infiltrative
type (6 of which were FDG negative giving a sensitivity of
60 %), whilst 47 were mass forming (8 of which were FDG
negative giving a sensitivity of 83 %).
Discussion
Most previous studies examining the role of FDG PET-CT in
biliary malignancy have focused on the effectiveness of FDG
PET-CT in assessing the primary tumour and extent of any
spread, with few considering its overall impact on patient
management. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of
FDG PET-CT on the management pathway of patients with
primary biliary malignancy and to help define its role in the
work-up of these tumours.
FDG PET-CT was concordant with findings on CT/MRI
in 74 cases (63 %)—44 with no distant disease on FDG PET￾CT or CT/MRI, 1 with indeterminate findings on both FDG
PET-CT and CT/MRI and 29 with suspected distant disease
on both FDG PET-CT and CT/MRI. Overall, FDG PET-CT
had a major impact in 28 % of cases (33/118). It detected
occult sites of disease in 24 patients, helped to characterise 7
indeterminate lesions on cross-sectional imaging and detect￾ed 2 incidental synchronous primary cancers.
FDG PET-CT had the biggest influence in the gallbladder
carcinoma group, having a major impact in 39 % of cases
(12/31), including upstaging 27 % of the scans performed for
initial staging (7/26). FDG PET-CT changed management
mainly by identifying occult sites of disease not detected by
CT/MRI (in nine patients) and finding unsuspected sites of
disease recurrence (in two patients). Few published studies
describe rates of impact of FDG PET-CT in gallbladder can￾cer; however, our rate is somewhat higher than that reported
previously. In a recent study by Corvera et al. [9], FDG-PET
(without CT) altered management in 20 % (25/126) of patients
with biliary cancer, including 23 % (7/31) of patients with
gallbladder carcinoma. Similarly, Petrwosky et al. [10] in a
study that included 14 patients with gallbladder carcinoma
report a change of management in 17 %, whilst Lee et al. [11]
in a study of 16 patients report a change of management in

9.8 % of patients who were deemed resectable after standard
staging; however both these studies also included patients with
cholangiocarcinoma with no subgroup data. A possible expla￾nation for the discrepancy in the rates of impact may be due to
the process of patient selection. All patients in our study were
individually selected for FDG PET-CT following discussion at a
specialised MDT, where specific indications for performing the
test were considered on a case-by-case basis. FDG PET-CT was
not deemed necessary in some patients if conventional imaging
with CT/MRI was thought to be clear-cut. Other published
studies were less selective and included all patients with a
suspected diagnosis of gallbladder carcinoma. The time lag to
FDG PET-CT following conventional imaging may also have
contributed to some patients with very aggressive tumours de￾veloping new sites of disease, which were then detected on FDG
PET-CT. However, the vast majority of cases were scanned
within a 90-day period with a mean time to PET-CT of 38 days.
The other studies described did not report a time-frame for
performing PET-CT and hence a comparison cannot be made.
Gallbladder carcinoma is associated with a rate of perito￾neal metastasis as high as 30–75 %, and the risk of metastasis
strongly correlates with the presenting T stage [12]. While
FDG PET-CT can detect occult sites of disease not seen on
conventional imaging, it may still fail to identify carcinoma￾tosis due to reduced sensitivity in detection of sub-centimetre
lesions (a recognised limitation of PET) and, in particular,
small volume peritoneal disease. Three of the gallbladder
cancers in our group thought resectable after FDG PET-CT
were found to have unresectable peritoneal disease at lapa￾rotomy, with similar findings reported by others. In the study
by Corvera et al. [9], five of the gallbladder cancers deemed
resectable on PET were found to be unresectable at surgical
exploration, three having locally advanced disease and two
small volume peritoneal disease. Anderson et al. [13] in a
study of 14 patients with gallbladder carcinoma detected
peritoneal carcinomatosis in only three of six affected pa￾tients, attributing the results to the small size of the lesions.
One false-positive occurred in a patient with xantho￾granulomatous cholecystitis (Fig. 4), a finding also reported
by Wakabayashi et al. [14] and Koh et al. [15] both in eight
patients with gallbladder carcinoma. Anderson et al. [13]
described a false-positive in a patient studied 1 month after
cholecystectomy with FDG uptake in residual post-surgical
inflammatory change, thought to represent metastatic dis￾ease. Although this was not our experience, it does highlight
the importance of considering the time interval between

surgery and performing FDG PET-CT in order to minimise
uptake in inflammatory tissue, especially when the gallblad￾der carcinoma is incidental and post-surgical staging is
performed. In our experience, it is advisable to wait a min￾imum of 4 weeks and preferably at least 6 weeks following
surgery to avoid false-positive uptake in post-surgical
inflammation.
FDG PET-CT identified 100 % of the 15 primary gallblad￾der carcinomas left in situ. This is consistent with previous
published studies, which report sensitivity rates of 87.5-100 %
for FDG PET-CT [10, 11] and 75-86 % for PET alone [9, 13,
15, 16].
The overall sensitivity of FDG PET-CT for the detection of
primary cholangiocarcinoma was generally lower at 77 %
(48/62), with a much higher sensitivity for intra-hepatic than
for extra-hepatic cholangiocarcinoma (92 %, 36/39 versus
52 %, 12/23). Similar findings have been reported by
Petrowsky et al. [10] with FDG PET-CT sensitivity of 93 %
for intra-hepatic (n=19) versus 55 % for extra-hepatic chol￾angiocarcinoma (n=36). Kim et al. [17] in a study of 123
patients with suspected cholangiocarcinoma also reported
higher sensitivity of FDG PET-CT for intra-hepatic cholan￾giocarcinoma with PET-CT being falsely negative for the
primary tumour in 15 patients (14 of which were extra￾hepatic cholangiocarcinomas).
As well as its location, the morphological characteristics of
the primary tumour may also influence its detection rate.
Similar to our results, Anderson et al. [13] in a study of 36
patients with suspected extra-hepatic cholangiocarcinoma re￾ported a sensitivity of FDG-PET of 85 % for nodular mor￾phology (mass >1 cm) versus only 18 % for infiltrating
morphology. The difference has been attributed to infiltrating
tumours having lower cellular density and causing little struc￾tural abnormality. Also, intra-hepatic cholangiocarcinomas

tend to be much larger at presentation. FDG PET-CT is known
to have low sensitivity for mucinous tumours and hence may
miss mucinous types of cholangiocarcinoma [18].
Whilst PET-CT may have little diagnostic advantage over
traditional imaging modalities in detecting the primary chol￾angiocarcinoma [19], it has been shown to be substantially
sensitive and specific for the detection and characterisation of
metastases [20]. In this series, FDG PET-CT had a major
impact on patient management in 24 % (21/87) of
cholangiocarcinomas, 26 % (14/54) of intra-hepatic and
21 % (7/33) of extra-hepatic tumours, finding occult sites of
disease in 16 (including 5 cases of recurrence) and character￾izing indeterminate lesions in another 5. Overall, FDG PET￾CT upstaged 19 % (12/62) and downstaged 3 % (2/62) of the
scans performed for initial staging. This rate of impact is
similar to that reported previously. In the study by Anderson
et al. [13], FDG-PET led to a change in surgical management
in 30 % (11/36) of patients with suspected extra-hepatic
cholangiocarcinoma due to detection of unsuspected metasta￾ses. Kim et al. [17] also reported about 94/123 patients who
went on to have a final histological diagnosis of cholangio￾carcinoma, for whom FDG PET-CT findings changed man￾agement in 15 (15.9 %), upgrading from resectable to
unresectable in 7 patients (7.4 %) and downgrading a further
8 (8.5 %). Moon et al. [19], in a series of 54 patients, reported
that FDG-PET (without CT) detected nine metastatic lesions
not found by other imaging studies, stopping two patients
from undergoing unnecessary laparotomy.
FDG PET-CT was falsely negative in two out of three
patients with PSC, failing to detect the primary cholangiocar￾cinoma in both. One was a very small extra-hepatic tumour,
which may have been below the size threshold for detection
by PET. The lack of FDG uptake in the second tumour, a large
well-differentiated intra-hepatic cholangiocarcinoma, is less
clear. There are limited published data regarding the efficacy
of FDG PET-CT in patients with PSC. Prytz et al. [21]
performed FDG-PET on 24 patients with PSC awaiting liver
transplantation with no evidence of malignancy on CT, MRI
or ultrasound. Three patients had cholangiocarcinoma that
was correctly identified by PET and the authors concluded
that FDG-PET may be useful in screening for cholangiocar￾cinoma in patients with PSC. However, this did not prove to
be the case in our experience or of others [22].
Similar to the gallbladder carcinoma group, FDG PET-CT
was also falsely negative in three cholangiocarcinomas with
unsuspected peritoneal disease found at laparotomy. In the
study by Kim et al. [17], FDG PET-CT also failed to detect
distant metastases in five patients, including four with peri￾toneal disease. We found a single false-positive in a patient
with suspected peritoneal disease due to disseminated FDG
uptake, however staging laparotomy was negative and ap￾pearances had been secondary to cholangitis and bile leak at
the time of PET-CT. False-positive FDG uptake due to
benign inflammatory causes is well recognised and a degree
of caution has to be observed to avoid misinterpretation [23].
There are several limitations to this study which should be
acknowledged. The referral mechanism for FDG PET-CT was
determined on a case-by-case basis via a specialist MDT
meeting, with each patient specifically chosen for the test to
help answer a clinical or radiological ambiguity and therefore
creating a selection bias. The time lag between studies also
causes a potential bias for PET-CT superiority in patients with
rapidly progressive disease. Another limitation is that data
were collected retrospectively at a large tertiary referral centre,
receiving patients from a wide geographical area. Consequent￾ly, a proportion of imaging studies were performed at referring
regional hospitals using different equipment and acquisition
protocols, possibly biasing image interpretation. The injection
rate and volume of contrast medium were not patient tailored,
which may also affect diagnostic accuracy. Assessment of
impact was determined following a comprehensive review
of all clinical and imaging data; however, such an assessment
may be imperfect in a retrospective study.
Despite these issues, we found FDG PET-CT to be reliable
in characterising indeterminate lesions and discriminating be￾tween benign and malignant disease with few false-positive
results. The majority of false-negative findings were due to
small volume peritoneal disease, which is a limitation for all
imaging studies at present. FDG PET-CT was particularly
effective at detecting metastatic disease that was unsuspected
or equivocal on cross-sectional imaging studies, changing the
stage of disease and influencing management in a significant
number of patients. The rate of impact was higher in gallblad￾der carcinomas than in cholangiocarcinomas.
Conclusion
By detecting occult metastatic disease and characterizing
indeterminate lesions, FDG PET-CT can have a major influ￾ence on clinical decision making in primary biliary malig￾nancy both as part of initial work-up and for identifying
recurrent disease, overall helping triage patients to the most
appropriate treatment.
