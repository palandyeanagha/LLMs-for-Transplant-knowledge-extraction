SUMMARY
Epstein-Barr virus infection is common in children,
usually presenting as infectious mononucleosis, including
fever, tonsillitis and lymphadenopathy associated with
self-resolving increase in transaminases. Cholestasis is
rare in children with only a few cases reported but it
was described in up to 55% of the adult population
affected. We present a case of a 6-year-old boy with
fever, vomiting and choluria. The physical examination
showed hepatomegaly and jaundice and was otherwise
unremarkable. The laboratory studies revealed increased
transaminases (aspartate aminotransferase 97 U/L,
alanine aminotransferase 166 U/L), hyperbilirubinaemia
(total bilirubin 3.2 mg/dL, direct bilirubin 2.89 mg/dL)
and increased γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (114 mg/dL).
Urine urobilinogen was increased. The abdominal
ultrasound showed hepatomegaly. Epstein-Barr viral
capsid antibody IgM was positive and IgG was negative.
Serological studies for other viruses were negative. We
underline the need to consider Epstein-Barr virus in the
cholestatic hepatitis differential diagnosis, in order to
avoid unnecessary investigations.
BACKGROUND
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infections are subclinical in
80–90% of cases, particularly among children,
causing asymptomatic increases in hepatic transami￾nases.1 2 They can also be associated with infectious
mononucleosis in adolescents and young adults (30–
50%), presenting with fever, pharyngotonsillitis,
lymphadenopathy and fatigue, often associated with
self-limited increase in transaminase values.3–5
Cholestatic EBV hepatitis is a rare presentation and
severe cholestasis is seen in 5% of cases.3 4
CASE PRESENTATION
A 6-year old previously healthy boy presented at
the emergency department with fever (axillar tem￾perature of 39.8°C every 4 h), vomiting, fatigue
and choluria from past 3 days. He had been medi￾cated with paracetamol 15 mg/kg/dose to a
maximum of four times/day during the previous
3 days. No other medication had been carried out.
On admission he was slightly pale, with jaun￾diced sclerae and had hepatomegaly (2 cm below
the right costal margin). No significant lymphaden￾opathy or splenomegaly was palpable and the oro￾pharynx had a normal appearance.
INVESTIGATIONS
Laboratory studies revealed: 14 200/μL leucocytes
(4500–11 000/μL), 63% lymphocytes, haemoglobin
11.8 g/dL (11–13.5 g/dL), platelet count 268 000/μL
(150 000–400 000/μL), aspartate aminotransferase
97 U/L (8–20 U/L), alanine aminotransferase 166 U/L
(8–20 U/L), total bilirubin 3.2 mg/dL (0.1–1 mg/dL),
direct bilirubin 2.89 mg/dL (0–0.3 mg/dL),
γ-glutamyl transpeptidase 114 mg/dL (11–50 U/L)
and increased urine urobilinogen.
The abdominal ultrasound showed hepatomegaly
and was otherwise normal.
Epstein-Barr viral capsid antibody IgM was posi￾tive and IgG was negative. Serological studies for
cytomegalovirus, hepatitis A, B and C virus, HIV,
parvovirus B19, Brucella, Mycoplasma pneumo￾niae, Leptospira and Legionella pneumophila were
not compatible with acute infection.
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
The patient presented with confirmed clinical and
laboratory cholestatic hepatitis associated to an acute
EBV infection. Other serological studies for common
pathogens involved in such presentations were nega￾tive. The patient was medicated with paracetamol,
which could cause drug-induced hepatitis, although
this hypothesis was remote, since the duration of
treatment was short, the dosage was correct and the
outcome was favourable.
OUTCOME AND FOLLOW-UP
The patient evolved favourably, remaining afebrile
from the third day of admission and showing com￾plete clinical and analytical remission 2 months
after presentation.
DISCUSSION
EBV is a very common infectious agent during
childhood, affecting 345–671/100 000 people aged
15–19 years/year, with decreasing incidence in
older ages (2–4/100 000/year in the population
over 34 years of age).6 It is usually associated with
mild and self-limited hepatitis but there are reports
of incidence as high as 55% of severe cholestatic
hepatitis in adults.7
Atypical manifestations have been increasingly
recognised. EBV infection should be considered
when facing increased transaminase values and a
self-limited cholestatic pattern, even in the absence
of other typical symptomatology.7 8
Jaundice during EBV infections can be caused by
autoimmune haemolytic anaemia or cholestasis (due
to acalculous cholecystitis, biliary duct obstruction
due to abdominal lymphadenopathy and cholestatic
hepatitis).9–16 Jaundice is more frequent in people
aged 35 or older (30%) than in people aged less than
35 years (3%).12 Increased bilirubin levels have been
reported in up to 35% of patients with infectious
mononucleosis but is rarely described without
splenomegaly, exanthema or tonsillitis.13
The severity of the symptomatology is related to
the immunological response, which explains why

EBV infection is frequently subclinical during childhood and
frankly symptomatic in adults.14
Our patient presented with a pattern of cholestatic hepa￾titis, with increased direct bilirubin and γ-glutamyl transpep￾tidase. The abdominal ultrasound showed the absence of
cholecystitis or biliary obstruction. Serological results were
suggestive of acute EBV infection and the other frequent
infectious causes were excluded. No significant medication
was carried out that would cause acute drug-induced hepa￾titis, since acetaminophen toxicity is a predictable intrinsic
reaction and our patient had been medicated with a correct
dosage.15
The mechanism of liver cell damage that leads to cholestasis
has not been cleared yet, given the fact that EBV does not
cause direct cytotoxic effects on hepatocytes. Cholestasis is
possibly related to lipid peroxidation and consequent free
radical production, which can explain our patient’s clinical
presentation.16
Although cholestatic hepatitis has been reported mainly in
adults,17 there are reports of atypical presentation of EBV infec￾tion associated with cholestasis among children.11 This case
illustrates the importance of considering EBV as an aetiological
agent, also in children.11–13
Learning points
▸ Atypical presentations of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection
are more common with increasing age but can also be seen
in young children.
▸ Jaundice may be caused by haemolytic anaemia or
cholestasis, which makes laboratory studies and ultrasound
valuable tools to identify its origin.
▸ Cholestatic hepatitis, although more commonly caused by
pathogens such as hepatitis A, must elicit the hypothesis of
infection by EBV.
▸ Considering EBV is important to avoid unnecessary
investigations.
