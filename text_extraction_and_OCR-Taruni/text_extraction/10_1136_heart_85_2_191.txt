Abstract
OBJECTIVE To examine cardiopulmonary values, static lung
function, and ejection fraction in adult patients with congenitally
corrected transposition of the great arteries (CCTGA).
PATIENTS AND METHODS 41 patients who had undergone static
lung function testing and cardiopulmonary exercise tests with
measurements of ejection fraction were identified at the Toronto
Congenital Cardiac Centre for Adults.
RESULTS Aerobic capacity in patients with CCTGA was severely
diminished, varying from 30–50% of the results achieved by
healthy subjects. Normal values of right ventricular and left
ventricular ejection fraction were found. However, the systemic
right ventricular ejection fraction increased by 2% from rest to
exercise, as opposed to the expected > 5% increase in a healthy
population. The pulmonary left ventricular ejection fraction
decreased by 2% at peak exercise.
CONCLUSION Diminished values of heart rate, forced expiratory
volume in one second (FEV1), forced vital capacity, and systolic
blood pressure compared to the predicted values may contribute to
the reduced maximal oxygen uptake (Vo 2max) found in patients
with CCTGA. In addition, a limited increase in systolic right
ventricular ejection fraction and a decrease in pulmonary left
ventricle contractility suggest a dysfunction of both ventricles.
