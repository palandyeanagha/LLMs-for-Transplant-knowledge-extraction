1. Introduction
Dystrophinopathies are X-linked muscle disorders 
caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene, located 
at Xp21, that encodes for the sarcolemmal protein 
dystrophin, virtually present in all tissues, but most 
abundant in skeletal muscle cells and heart (1-3). 
Dystrophin provides the connection between a large 
complex of glycoproteins called the dystrophin￾associated glycoprotein complex (DAG) on the muscle 
cell membrane and the intracellular actin filaments, 
that transmit forces generated by the sarcomere 
contraction to the extracellular matrix (4,5). Absence, 
reduced levels or abnormal structure of dystrophin 
lead to membrane fragility, making muscle fibres 
more prone to injury during contraction (6). As muscle 
disease progresses, muscle repair cannot adequately 
compensate for damage, leading to necrosis of skeletal 
and cardiac myocytes and the progressive replacement 
by fibro-fatty tissue (7-15). Dystrophinopathies 
include four different clinical presentations: Duchenne 
muscular dystrophy (DMD), the more severe form, 
Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD), the more benign 
Summary Cardiomyopathy associated with dystrophinopathies [Duchenne muscular dystrophy 
(DMD), Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD), X-linked dilated cardiomyopathy (XL-dCM) 
and cardiomyopathy of Duchenne/Becker (DMD/BMD) carriers] is an increasing recognized 
manifestation of these neuromuscular disorders and notably contributes to their morbidity 
and mortality. Dystrophinopathic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is the result of the dystrophin 
protein deficiency at the myocardium level, parallel to the deficiency occurring at the 
skeletal muscle level. It begins as a "presymptomatic" stage in the first decade of life and 
evolves in a stepwise manner toward pictures of overt cardiomyopathy (hypertrophic stage, 
arrhythmogenic stage and dilated cardiomyopathy). The final stage caused by the extensive 
loss of cardiomyocytes results in an irreversible cardiac failure, characterized by frequent 
episodes of acute congestive heart failure (CHF), despite a correct pharmacological treatment. 
The picture of a severe dilated cardiomyopathy with intractable heart failure is typical of 
BMD, XL-dCM and cardiomyopathy of DMD/BMD carriers, while it is less frequently 
observed in patients with DMD. Heart transplantation (HT) is the only curative therapy for 
patients with dystrophinopathic end-stage heart failure who remain symptomatic despite 
an optimal medical therapy. However, no definitive figures exist in literature concerning 
the number of patients with DCM transplanted, and their outcome. This overview is to 
summarize the clinical outcomes so far published on the topic, to report the personal series 
of dystrophinopathic patients receiving heart transplantation and finally to provide evidence 
that heart transplantation is a safe and effective treatment for selected patients with end-stage 
DCM.

form, the X-linked dilated cardiomyopathy (XL-dCM) 
(8) and the cardiomyopathy of DMD/BMD carriers.
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD, OMIM 
310200) is the most common muscle disorder in infancy, 
affecting 1 in 3.500 male newborns (9). It is the most 
severe form of dystrophinopathy, caused by the complete 
absence of the dystrophin protein at both skeletal and 
cardiac muscle level. Becker muscular dystrophy 
(BMD, OMIM 300376) is the milder dystrophinopathy 
affecting 1 in 18.450 males (9). Symptoms typically 
begin between ages 3 and 21, with a mean age of onset 
of 11 years. The disease is usually caused by "in frame" 
mutations able to produce a certain amount of dystrophin 
(16). BMD, unlike Duchenne-type muscular dystrophy, is 
characterized by a slow progression of muscle weakness 
so that in many patients the independent activity is 
maintained until late adulthood. 
XL-dCM, first described in 1993 by Towbin (17), 
is a rare cardiomyopathy caused by mutations in the 
5' end of the dystrophin gene that lead to the absence 
of the M-isoform of dystrophin only in the heart (17). 
The preserved skeletal muscle strength increases 
cardiac demands, leading to dilated cardiomyopathy 
(18). The clinical picture is characterized by the onset 
of congestive heart failure (CHF) in young men with a 
mean age of 15-30, with a rapid fatal evolution within 
2 years from the onset, although older patients can also 
be affected. 
The majority of DMD and BMD female carriers 
are asymptomatic; however, few of them may show 
muscle symptoms (8,16) such as mild muscle weakness 
and elevated serum CK, while a larger part present 
cardiomyopathy (20-25). The onset of symptoms in 
DMD/BMD carriers may have several causes, the most 
frequent of them represented by a skewed X-chromosome 
inactivation (XCI) (26-28). 
The above mentioned clinical presentations arise from 
different pathogenic conditions with consequent variable 
degrees of skeletal muscle and cardiac involvement. 
Cardiac death usually occurs from ventricular 
dysfunction and dilated cardiomyopathy, that represents 
the end-stage of dystrophinopathic cardiomyopathy 
(DCM) (10-11,29-30). DCM is constantly progressive 
and evolves in a stage-wise manner, passing from a 
presymptomatic condition to dilated cardiomyopathy 
through a number of pathophysiologically distinct stages 
(10,11) (Figure 1). 
In brief, the presymptomatic stage is followed by 
a stage in which the myocardial fibrosis is limited to 
few foci (spotty or focal fibrosis), often inducing a 
compensatory hypertrophy of the surrounding areas 
still expressing dystrophin, with consequent regional 
heterogeneity of repolarization that can favor the 
onset of arrhythmias. Later, the confluence of these 
areas determines a widespread diffuse fibrosis leading 
to dilated cardiomyopathy, a stage characterized by 
ventricle enlargement, tinning of ventricular walls, and 
reduced left ejection fraction. Dilated cardiomyopathy 
in turn evolves toward the stage of heart failure (HF). 
The first episodes of HF are usually responsive to 
pharmacological treatment; subsequently, HF evolves 
towards the stage of intractable HF not amenable 
to adequate drug treatment. Therefore heart failure 
represents an important contributor to mortality in 
these patients (9,10) for which the heart transplantation 
(HT) remains the ultimate intervention to preserve 
life. However, despite the high incidence of end-stage 
DCM in patients with dystrophinopathies, there is a 
reluctance to perform heart transplantation in these 
patients due to the paucity of donors and the concerns 
that the accompanying myopathy will limit the benefits 
obtained through the HT.
Furthermore no definitive figures exist in literature 
about the number of patients with DCM transplanted 
and their outcome, nor clear indications in the current 
guidelines considering heart transplantation as an 
option for dystrophinopathic patients with end-stage 
heart failure.
This overview aims to i) report the so far published 
frequencies of heart transplantation in patients with 
DCM and related clinical outcomes; ii) report the 
personal series of dystrophinopathic patients who

institutional registry of 29 transplant centres in the 
United States, in the period 1990-2005. In their review 
- the largest study describing the long-term outcomes 
of cardiac transplantation in patients with BMD with 
a follow-up period extending more than 10 years - the 
post-transplant cardiac outcomes of 15 BMD patients 
were compared with those of 275 non-muscular 
dystrophy patients with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, 
matched for age, body mass index, gender, and race. 
The survival rate in BMD patients was similar to 
that of controls at 1 year (89% vs. 91%; p = 0.5) and 
5 years (83% vs. 78%; p = 0.5). The differences in 
rates of cumulative infection, rejection, or allograft 
vasculopathy between the 2 groups were not significant 
(p = 0.5 for all comparisons). 
Ruiz-Cano et al. (35) described a Spanish single￾centre experience with HT in 3 BMD patients with 
a mean follow-up duration of 57.4 months. Both 
intra-operative and post-operative course of these 
individuals did not show higher complication rates than 
other patients. All recipients experienced successful 
rehabilitation; no evidence of graft dysfunction was 
detected during the follow-up. All patients were alive 
at the time of the study, and in good performance. The 
AA concluded that HT for patients with BMD end-stage 
cardiomyopathy is not associated with a poorer prognosis 
when there is a mild degree of muscular impairment. 
Casazza et al. (36), reported the case of a successful 
cardiac transplantation because of a severe and rapidly 
progressive dilated cardiomyopathy complicated by 
terminal heart failure in a BMD patient with a mild 
muscle impairment. Unfortunately, no data about the 
long-term prognosis of this patient have been reported. 
Patanè et al. (37) described a 27-year-old BMD 
patient with end-stage dilated cardiomyopathy and 
CHF who was fairly well, one year after a successful 
transplantation. Melacini et al. (38) reported the 
case of a 24-years-old BMD patient, with end-stage 
dilated cardiomyopathy and moderate myopathy, who 
successfully underwent heart transplantation. The 
patient received triple immunosuppressive therapy 
consisting of azathioprine, cyclosporineA (CyA) and 
prednisone in the post-operative period. 
Steger et al. (39) extrapolated 4 patients (1.19 %) 
affected by end-stage cardiomyopathy related to 
inherited myopathies from a large cohort of 335 patients 
undergoing HT at the Innsbruck Medical University, 
between January 1994 and December 2011. Three of 
them had BMD, and 1- female- was affected by limb￾girdle muscular dystrophy; the mean age of patients 
was 38.5 years (range 16-56) and the post-operative 
follow-up period was on average 68.5 months (range 
16-139). All patients had an uneventful immediate post￾operative course. One of them (BMD) died 16 months 
after the HT because of pulmonary embolism and right 
heart failure, and one 11 years after HT because of 
myocardial and cerebral infarction following tricuspid 
received HT and iii) provide evidence that HT is a safe 
and effective treatment for selected patients with end￾stage DCM.
2. Heart transplantation in patients with dystro￾phinopathic cardiomyopathy
2.1. Review of the literature
Inherited myopathies in patients with secondary end￾stage cardiomyopathies have always been considered 
a relative contraindication for cardiac transplantation. 
High operative risk related to muscle impairment and 
potential graft involvement secondary to the underlying 
myopathy have been the two main reasons implicated in 
the poor prognosis. For these reasons, HT has not been 
considered an appropriate treatment option for DMD 
patients with drug-resistant dilated cardiomyopathy, 
because of pulmonary function and skeletal muscles 
impairment (31). The literature contains only two 
isolated reports of successful heart transplantation in 
these patients (31,32). Cripe et al. (31) reported the 
case of a 14-year-old DMD patient with severe dilated 
cardiomyopathy, but preserved pulmonary function 
who underwent a successful cardiac transplantation 
surviving four years later. Rees et al. (32) described 
HT in 3 patients with DMD with a mean duration 
of follow-up of 40 months. All the patients tolerated 
immunosuppression, had no complications in post￾operative intubation and were able to be rehabilitated, 
suggesting that cardiac transplantation can be 
successfully performed in DMD patients presenting a 
severe cardiomyopathy, preserved pulmonary function, 
and a discrete muscle function. Recently, Amodeo 
et al. (33) explored at the Bambino Gesù Children's 
Hospital in Rome, the use of left ventricular assist 
devices (LVAD-Jarvik 2000) as destination therapy in 7 
DMD patients, as an alternative treatment for selected 
end-stage heart failure in DMD. All patients survived 
to hospital discharge and resumed previous activities; 
however data about their long-term outcomes remain 
limited.
Likewise, few cases of HT in patients with Becker 
muscular dystrophy have been so far reported in 
literature (34-39), though heart failure is the most 
frequent cause of death in these patients. In fact 
patients with BMD seem to pay the advantage of a 
prolonged ambulation with a higher occurrence of heart 
involvement and dilated cardiomyopathy, that represents 
the major cause of their morbidity and mortality (19,40-
43). Some dystrophin mutations have been correlated to 
an increased incidence of severe cardiomyopathy (3) in 
these patients in which the presence of cardiomyopathy 
dramatically reduces the life expectancy, otherwise only 
slightly limited compared to normal subjects (44). Wu 
et al. (34) reported the results of a retrospective review 
of the Cardiac Transplant Research Database, a multi-

valve replacement. The remaining 2 patients were in 
good general condition without progression of the 
muscle disease, for the entire period of the study. The 
AA concluded that HT may increase the quality of life 
and life expectancy in selected patients suffering from 
end-stage heart failure due to inherited benign muscular 
dystrophies. These data seem to disclaim the long￾held belief that patients with muscular dystrophy and 
advanced stages of cardiomyopathy may have worse 
outcomes after HT compared with patients without it. 
To date there is only one report on HT in patients 
with XL-dCM (45). Out of 4 patients (mean age 24, 
4 years; range 16-31) who were heart transplanted 
in the period August 1989 - January 2000, only one 
died suddenly at 66 months of follow-up. At the time 
of heart transplantation all patients were in NYHA 
functional class IV. After 44 months of FU on average 
(range 22-66) all the patients were fine and in NYHA 
functional class I, stressing the concept that HT should 
be the first choice option for patients with XL-dCM 
and preserved muscle function, for whom myocardial 
end-stage disease and serious rhythm disturbances are 
severely disabling and life-threatening (46).
Very few cardiac transplantation case reports have 
been so far reported in cardiological manifesting DMD 
carriers (47,48) for whom once again the only hope 
for survival remains heart transplantation. Melacini 
et al. (47) reported the first case of successful HT 
in a symptomatic DMD carrier, with severe dilated 
cardiomyopathy, showing a deletion of exons 50-
52. Davies et al. (48) reported the case of a 25-year￾old DMD carrier who during the third trimester of 
her pregnancy developed a severe cardiac failure and 
performed successful heart transplantation, after 311 
days of mechanical circulatory support.
2.2. Personal series
Among 55 patients affected by dystrophin related end￾stage cardiomyopathy followed in our division in 
the last 15 years, 4 of them (7.2%) underwent heart 
transplantation. Three of them had Becker's muscular 
dystrophy and the fourth was affected by XL-dCM. The 
clinical characteristics of the patients are summarised in 
Table 1. 
After transplantation, all patients received triple 
drug immunosuppressive therapy with cyclosporine, 
everolimus and steroids. High-dose steroid therapy 
was withdrawn within 12 months following HT in all 
patients. 
Becker Cases: Cases 1 and 2 were diagnosed as 
BMD at the age of 15 and 17 years respectively, when 
they complained of mild muscle weakness, associated 
with increased serum creatin-kinase (CK) levels 
(mean values 6.3 times the maximum normal values). 
Molecular investigation confirmed the diagnosis, 
showing a deletion of exons 45-49 in dystrophin gene 
in both cases.
At the age of 31 years, both developed dilated 
cardiomyopathy that required orthotopic HT in the 
following few years, performed at the age of 34 years in 
case 1, and at the age of 33 years in case 2 (Figure 2A). 
At the time of transplant pre-evaluation, both 
patients had very mild muscular impairment and 
no respiratory involvement. The intra-operative 
and early post-operative courses did not reveal any 
complications; mechanical ventilation was withdrawn 
within 10 hours following surgery. Both patients had 
a successful functional rehabilitation reaching a good 
performance status. Case 1, nine months following 
HT, experienced mild signs of laboratory rejection, 
promptly resolved by the immunosuppressive therapy 
optimization. Case 2 showed, in the last 2 years, a 
slight progressive worsening of kidney function related 
to immunosuppressive therapy (serum creatinine value 
of 2.6 mg/dL; CrCl 40.96 mL/min; stage III of renal 
failure), which required cyclosporine dose reduction. 
To date, more than 10 years following HT, no evidence 
of graft dysfunction was detected (Figure 2B), while 
a very slow progression of the pre-existing muscular 
impairment was observed. Both patients continue to 
have a good quality of life. 
Case 3 was initially diagnosed as idiopathic dilated 
cardiomyopathy, complicated by terminal heart failure. 
He required 2 years later an orthotopic HT. The early 
post-surgical period was uneventful. Two years after 
HT, the patient was addressed to our division for muscle 
weakness at lower limbs and increased serum CK values. 
Based on clinical evaluation and molecular investigation 
(presence of a deletion of exons 3 and 4 in dystrophin 
gene), a diagnosis of BMD was made. Seven years after 
HT, the patient showed clinical and echocardiographic

evidence of acute graft dysfunction, and a reduction 
(< 35%) of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). 
The replacement of everolimus with mycophenolate 
mofetil produced a progressive improvement of patient's 
condition and of echocardiographic parameters (LVEF: 
50%). Twelve years later, he developed an acute 
complete (3rd degree) atrio-ventricular block requiring 
a pacemaker implantation; after two years a new heart 
transplant was indicated, for evidence of clinical and 
echocardiographic graft rejection (LVEF 25%). However, 
the transplant was not performed as the patient died 
suddenly during sleep, before performing it.
Case 4: The patient was addressed to our department 
for signs and symptoms of low cardiac output, history 
of reduced exercise tolerance and exertional dyspnea. 
At the first examination, no muscle and respiratory 
weakness were noted, while CK values were increased. 
The patient underwent both muscle and endomyocardial 
biopsies, who showed the absence of the dystrophin 
staining with the antibody anti-NH2 terminal domain 
only at the cardiac level, not in the muscle. The 
dystrophin staining was instead normal at both cardiac 
and muscle level with the antibodies anti-ROD and 
anti-COOH domains. A diagnosis of X-linked dilated 
cardiomyopathy was made and the patient treated 
accordingly. 
During the following years an intractable 
congestive heart failure required HT, performed at the 
age of 27 years. The early post-operative course was 
uncomplicated; mechanical ventilation was withdrawn 
within the following 24 hours. The patient returned to 
work and till now he continues to have a good exercise 
tolerance and quality of life.
3. Discussion
The long-term clinical outcomes of cardiac 
transplantation in patients with dystrophinopathic 
cardiomyopathy properly selected, seem to be similar to 
that of a matched cohort of patients undergoing HT for 
idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, by analysing the few 
evidence available in literature. 
However, special care and consideration are 
necessary during the peri-operative and post-operative 
period to avoid life-threatening complications and 
the progression of the primary disease. Among 
them, an intensive neuromyological observation is 
necessary in order to i) adequately adapt the dosage of 
immunosuppressants to avoid the onset of a secondary 
myopathy and the occurrence of rhabdomyolysis due

to the toxic affect of cyclosporine and ii) to limit the 
post-operative complications and the progression of the 
primary muscle disease. In fact the combined use of 
cyclosporine and lipid-lowering agent, such as statins 
and gemfibrozil, could be toxic for muscle cells (49). 
Also in our experience, HT remains the treatment 
of choice for patients with advanced DCM and poor 
muscle impairment. No other treatment option such as 
medical therapy or electrical and/or mechanical devices, 
can compete with HT long-term results, particularly 
when compared with the natural course of end-stage 
heart failure. Even the fear of a possible heart rejection 
is limited - at least for patients suffering from BMD, 
XL-dCM and relative carriers - because the presence of 
some dystrophin makes it very unlikely the production 
of antibodies against the dystrophin-deleted-region. As 
a consequence, a more favourable prognosis may be 
expected in these subjects.
Given for that a special attention should be given 
to the extent of skeletal myopathy, respiratory muscle 
involvement and survival in these patients, however 
it's time that cardiac surgeons overcome the reluctance 
to heart transplant patients with dystrophinopathic 
cardiomyopathy, due to the supposed reduced life 
expectancy. The long-term prognosis in these patients in 
fact is closely related to the possibility to be transplanted.
