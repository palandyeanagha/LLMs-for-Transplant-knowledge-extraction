Abstract
Background: Cerebrovascular complications are severe events following orthotopic liver
transplantation (OLT). This study aimed to observe the clinical and neuroimaging features and
possible risk factors of in-hospital cerebrovascular complications in the patients who underwent
OLT.
Patients and methods: We retrospectively reviewed 337 consecutive patients who underwent
358 OLTs. Cerebrovascular complications were determined by clinical and neuroimaging
manifestations, and the possible risk factors were analyzed in the patients with intracranial
hemorrhage.
Results: Ten of 337 (3.0%) patients developed in-hospital cerebrovascular complications (8 cases
experienced intracranial hemorrhage and 2 cases had cerebral infarction), and 6 of them died. The
clinical presentations were similar to common stroke, but with rapid deterioration at early stage.
The hematomas on brain CT scan were massive, irregular, multifocal and diffuse, and most of them
were located at brain lobes and might enlarge or rebleed. Infarcts presented lacunar and multifocal
lesions in basal gangliar but with possible hemorrhagic transformation. The patients with
intracranial hemorrhage had older age and a more frequency of systemic infection than non￾intracranial hemorrhage patients. (P = 0.011 and 0.029, respectively).
Conclusion: Posttransplant cerebrovascular complications have severe impact on outcome of the
patients who received OLT. Older age and systemic infection may be the possible risk factors of
in-hospital intracranial hemorrhage following OLT.
Background
With the rapid development of transplant technique and
immunosuppressive therapy, orthotopic liver transplanta￾tion (OLT) has been carried out all over the world and
accepted as one of the most effective treatments for the
patients with end-stage liver diseases. However, postoper￾ative complications are still the most important causes
resulting in death of patients undergoing OLT. The inci￾dences of posttransplant cerebrovascular complications or
intracranial hemorrhage were 2.2%–3.9% in United

States [1-3], 3.3% in United Kingdom[4], 3.7% in
Chile[5], 6% in Spain[6], 6.5% in Hong Kong[7] clini￾cally, and 32.7% in post-mortem patients after OLT in
United States[8]. But cerebrovascular complications fol￾lowing OLT in patients of mainland China have not been
reported. In the present study, we reported the incidence,
mortality and clinical and neuroimaging features, then
analyzed the possible risk factors of in-hospital cerebrov￾ascular complications in patients following OLT at a
center in southern China.
Methods
Patients
We retrospectively reviewed 337 consecutive patients who
underwent 358 OLTs in which 19 patients had a second
transplant, and one had a third transplant, at an organ
transplant center in southern China from Janurary
1st,1996 to June 30th, 2005. The mean age was 47 ± 11.5
years (3 months to 75 years), and 288 of 337 patients
were males. The primary liver diseases before OLT are
listed in Table 1.
Management
All patients underwent OLT using Piggyback technique
and were managed in an intensive care unit before being
transferred to a general ward following surgery. FK506,
cyclosporine A or corticosteroids were used as immuno￾suppressives and their serum level was measured daily
postoperativly. Blood tests such as blood platelet counts,
prothrombin time (PT), activated partial prothrombin
time (APPT), the function of the liver and kidney and
other necessary tests were measured routinely. Brain com￾puted tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) was performed in patients when neurological
symptoms occurred after OLT.
We focused on the clinical and neuroimaging features of
the patients with in-hospital cerebrovascular complica￾tions following OLT, and analyzed the possible risk fac￾tors in the patients with intracranial hemorrhage.
The research protocol was approved by the local ethical
committee for clinical research and all procedures involv￾ing the participant were conducted according to institu￾tional guidelines in compliance with the regulations. Both
oral and written informed consents were obtained from
the patients or their families.
Statistical analysis
All statistical calculations were performed on microcom￾puter using SPSS13.0 (SPSS Inc). Continuous variables
were compared using two tails student's t-test, and cate￾gorical variables analyzed by a chisquare analysis or
Fisher's exact test. A p value less than 0.05 was considered
significantly.
Results
In all 10 patients (6 males, 4 females) aged 56 ± 8.4 years
(40 to 67 years) developed in-hospital cerebrovascular
complications following OLT, resulting in an incidence of
3.0% in 337 patients. The mean in-hospital time were 39
± 21.7 days (8 to 70 days). All patients with cerebrovascu￾lar complications had brain CT scan. Among them, eight
patients (8/337, 2.4%) experienced intracranial hemor￾rhage, including 5 with lobe hematomas, 2 with subdural
hematomas, and 1 with lobe and subarachnoid hemor￾rhage, and 7 of 8 intracranial hemorrhages occurred
within posttransplant 1 month. The clinical presenta￾tions, such as unconsciousness, headache, aphasia, hemi￾paresis, seizures, were similar to common hemorrhagic
stroke, but with rapid deterioration at early stage. Five of
8 patients with intracranial hemorrhage deteriorated clin￾ically and then died within two weeks after onset, includ￾ing two patients with enlargement of hematoma and
intraventricular mass, and a marked midline shift on
repeated CT. Two of 337 (0.6%) patients had lacunar cer￾Table 1: The primary liver diseases before orthotopic liver transplantation

ebral infarctions on the 6th and the 58th postoperative
day respectively. One patient's lesions located in basal
ganglia and cerebellum, the other patient with generalized
seizures at the oneset had a lacunar infarction at left basal
ganglia. Although the seizure stopped soon after antiepi￾leptic therapy, the aptient became apathia and reactive￾less, then persistent coma. Neurological examination
showed bilateral unclear papilla opticas with left papilla
optica retinal vein bleeding and stiff neck. It's a pity that
the repeat CT scan was not done due to the severe condi￾tions. The patient died of multiple organ failure on the
11th days after OLT. All clinical and laboratory data, as
well as brain CT findings of patients with cerebrovascular
complications following OLT are shown in an Additional
Table (see additional file 1).
Among the 8 patients with intracranial hemorrhage, two
of them received decompressive craniectomy and evacua￾tion of intracranial hematoma, but both died of brain her￾niation soon after the surgery. Other 6 patients received
medical treatement, and 3 of them survived. One of 2
patients with cerebral infarction died. Altogether, six of 10
patients with in-hospital cerebrovascular complications
died following OLT.
To analyze the possible risk factors and outcome of intrac￾ranial hemorrhage following OLT, we compared the clin￾ical and laboratory data between the patients with and
without intracranial hemorrhage (Table 2). In our series,
the patients with intracranial hemorrhage had older age
and a more frequency of systemic infection than non￾intracranial hemorrhage patients (56.3 ± 8.7 vs 46.7 ±
11.7 years old,p = 0.011; 7/8 vs152/329, p = 0.029, respec￾tively). The patients over 55 years were prone to have
intracranial hemorrhage than those less than 55 years (5/
75 vs 3/262, p = 0.015). Additionly, seven of 8 patients
with systemic bacterial or fungal infection experienced
intracranial hemorrhage, which had a more frequency
than those without infection (7/155 vs 1/182, p = 0.026).
The patients over 55 years with systemic infection had
more frequency of intracranial hemorrhage than those
less than 55 years and without systemic infection (5/37 vs
1/52,p = 0.043). Seven of 8 patients with intracranial
hemorrhage had infection, including 4 patients experi￾enced bacterial pneumonia, one had an aspergillus pneu￾monia, an aspergillus combinded Candida tropicalis
pneumonia and a bacterial pneumonia combinded uri￾nary tract infection respectively. The patients with intrac￾ranial hemorrhage had a higher mortality rate than those
without intracranial hemorrhage (5/8 vs 74/329, p =
0.019).
Discussion
Incidence and mortality rate
In the past 20 years, more and more patients with various
end-stage diseases have benefited from organ transplanta￾tion. But cerebrovascular events, especially intracranial
hemorrhage, have been concerned as severe neurological
complications after transplantation. The reported clinical
incidences of cerebrovascular complications were 1.7%–
6.5% [1-7], and the mortality rate of cerebrovascular com￾plications or intracranial hemorrhage were 57%–100%
following OLT[1,3,7]. Moreover, the incidence was 32.7%
in autopsy cases of patients who underwent OLT[8]. Cer￾ebrovascular complications are also common in other
transplantation patients. It has been reported that the

incidence of ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes was 6.8%
after kidney transplantation[9], 2.9% after bone marrow
transplantation[10], 0.9% after reduced-intensity stem
cell transplantation[11] and 2% in pediatric patients after
cardiac transplantation[12]. Our study showed that the
incidence of cerebrovascular complications in patients of
southern China who underwent OLT was 3.0%, and 6 of
10 died, which was similar to the previous international
reports [1-7]. These data indicate cerebrovascular events,
especially intracranial hemorrhage, are severe posttrans￾plant complications which deserve more attention for the
neurologists, neuro-intensivists and surgeons for organ
transplantion, and more endeavours should be done pro￾spectively to identify or aviod such complications in clin￾ical practice.
Clinical and neuroimaging features
In our study, the intracranial hemorrhage patients pre￾sented with unconsciousness, headache, aphasia, hemi￾paresis, seizures, which was consistent with the findings
of previous report[2]. These presentations were similar to
common stroke, but with more urgent onset, progressing
clinical course and rapid deterioration at early stage. In
our experience, sudden conscious disturbance (or loss of
consciousness) after OLT was strongly associated with
intracranial hemorrhage. In the present of coagulopathy,
metabolic disturbance or multiple organ failure in early
postoperative time, liver transplantation recipients were
prone to developed massive intracranial hematomas.
Moreover, these hematomas were not prone to cease
spontaneously and might enlarge gradually or rebleed,
even with a tendency to form cerebral herniation, which
results in the death. It is important to examine the con￾sciousness and pupils in patients after OLT. Brain CT scan
shoud be performed promptly to identify whether intrac￾ranial hemorrhage occurs once the patient has sudden
conscious disturbance or loss of consciousness following
OLT. Additionally, liver transplantation recipients may
occurr ischemic infarction due to the haemodynamic
change and coagulopathy, and then develop hemorrhagic
infarction, then deteriorated rapidly.
Possible risk factors
Most liver transplantation recipients are in the end-stage
of liver diseases, preoperative liver dysfunction even liver
failure results in thrombocytopenia and absence of coag￾ulation factors. Moreover, liver function may not return to
normal level in the postoperative early stage. All these
could result in coagulopathy, which can trigger intracra￾nial hemorrhage after OLT[2]. But in our series, no signif￾icant differences were found in the incidence of
thrombocytopenia, PT, or APPT between the patients with
and without intracranial hemorrhage, which suggests that
the causes of intracranial hemorrhage after OLT are multi￾ple and complex, except for coagulopathy, there may be
other factors responsible for this complication. In our
study, we found that intracranial hemorrhage patients
were older than non-intracranial hemorrhage patients,
moreover, the patients over 55 years had a more frequency
of intracranial hemorrhage than those less than 55 years
old. Additionly, the patients with systemic infection had a
more frequency of intracranial hemorrhage than those
without infection. The results indicate that older age and
systemic infection might be important risk factors of
intracranial hemorrhage following OLT. Cox and col￾leagues[13] reported that an 11-year-old boy who had
cystic fibrosis died of an intraventricular and intracerebral
hemorrhage caused by an aspergillus brain abscess on the
48th day after OLT. Wijdicks and colleagues[2] reported
that in the group of 8 patients with intracranial hemor￾rhage after OLT, one had a Candida-associated mycotic
aneurysm demonstrated by autopsy and another had dis￾seminated aspergillosis. Generally, it is presumed that
under the condition of systemic infection related to
immunosuppresion following OLT, aspergillus, toxo￾plasma and any virulent bacterial organism may lead to
inflammation of the arterial wall and formation of an
aneurysm[2,14-16]. In our series, seven of the 8 patients
with intracranial hemorrhage had systemic bacterial or
fungal infection, and all that them had pneumonia,
including 4 with bacterial pneumonia, one with aspergil￾lus pneumonia, one with aspergillus combinded Candida
tropicalis pneumonia and one with bacterial pneumonia
combinded urinary tract infection respectively. But it was
very pitiful that no evidence to support bacterial or fungal
infection is the direct cause of intracranial hemorrhage
due to no vascular image or post-mortem exams in the
present study. A published study showed that patients
with introperative hypotension were prone to develop cer￾ebral infarction after OLT[7]. In the present study, one
patient over 60 years old with cerebral infarction indeed
had introperative hypotension, indicating introperative
hypotension may be a potential risk factor of cerebral inf￾arction after OLT.
Conclusion
Although posttransplant cerebrovascular complications
are not common, they have severe impact on outcome of
the patients who received OLT. Age and systemic infection
may be the possible risk factors of in-hospital intracranial
hemorrhage following OLT. More effctive measures
should be taken to prevent posttransplant infection, such
as improvement of patient's systemic condition, bacterio￾logic surveillance and infection control measures. It is
urgent to early diagnosis and take more prompt systemic
antibiotic/antifungal therapy once infection occurs, espe￾cially in old patients. Further prospective study is neces￾sary to explore the risk factors and optimize the preventive
and therapeutic regimen of intracranial hemorrhage fol￾lowing OLT.
