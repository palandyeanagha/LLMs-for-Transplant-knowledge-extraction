Prevalence of liver disease in cystic fibrosis
R Scott-Jupp, M Lama, M S Tanner
Abstract
To assess the prevalence, demography, and
clinical features of liver disease among
patients with cystic fibrosis the case notes of
524 patients of ali ages who were attending the
cystic fibrosis clinic were studied. Computer
databases were used to establish the condition
of the liver in a further 576 such patients. The
overall prevalence of overt liver disease indi￾cated by the presence of an enlarged liver or
spleen (or both) was 4-2%. The age related
prevalence rose to a peak in adolescence, and
then feli in patients over 20 years old. The
implied increase in mortality among those
with liver disease was not explained by deaths
from liver disease, which were rare. Male
patients were significantly more affected than
female, the ratio being 3:1 among adoles￾cents. Increasing prevalence of liver disease
in patients with cystic fibrosis is, therefore,
not just a result of longevity.

Liver cirrhosis was recognised as a complication
of cystic fibrosis in Andersen's original descrip￾tion in 1938, but until recently the importance
of subclinical liver disease has been eclipsed by
the more obvious respiratory and pancreatic
signs and symptoms.' More effective manage￾ment of these has resulted in greatly improved
survival, and so liver disease has become impor￾tant to a larger number of patients.
The aetiology of focal biliary cirrhosis in
cystic fibrosis is uncertain,3 but poor nutrition,4
inspissated bile,5 autoimmunity,6 and biliary
tract obstruction7 8 have all been suggested.
Previous estimates of prevalence varied
depending on the diagnostic criteria used.9 1o If
cross sectional necropsy data are combined it
looks as if prevalence rises steadily with
age.5 12 There has been no study of clinically
important liver disease in a large group of
patients with cystic fibrosis spanning the entire
age range.
A number of authors have shown that liver
function tests are disordered in a high propor￾tion of patients with cystic fibrosis and liver
impairment, but that the degree of abnormality
does not correlate with the extent of
cirrhosis.5 13-16 Some patients with obvious
liver disease have normal test results, and there
is a large number whose results are abnormal
and whose true liver condition is uncertain.9 10
Patients and methods
The casenotes of all 524 patients attending adult
and paediatric specialist cystic fibrosis clinics in
four midlands centres (Birmingham, Notting￾ham, Peterborough, and Leicester) were
reviewed. Subsequently the computer records
of 576 patients with cystic fibrosis who were
attending clinics in three northern centres
(Manchester, Liverpool, and Leeds) were sur￾veyed. All those with possible clinical evidence
of liver disease were identified, and their case￾notes were then examined. All the patients had
undergone repeated abdominal examinations by
physicians experienced in treating cystic fibrosis
during routine visits to the clinic. From the
records the presence of an enlarged liver or
spleen (or both) was noted. If a spleen was
described as 'palpable' it was considered to be
enlarged. The liver was regarded as enlarged
when it protruded 3 cm or more below the cos￾tal margin and was not apparently pushed down
by hyperinflation of the lung. Radiological and
ultrasound findings were not considered.
For the 524 patients in the first four centres
only, those patients who had raised serum acti￾vities of aspartate transaminase, alanine amino￾transferase, or y-glutamyl transpeptidase at any
time, but excluding transient increases in the
activity of a single enzyme, were noted. These
data were incomplete because only 388 (74%) of
the group had ever had their liver function tests
done.
Evidence of symptomatic biliary disease was
sought, but was considered only when symp￾toms of biliary colic were accompanied by
radiographic or ultrasonographic evidence of
gall stones. Policies for investigating asymp￾tomatic biliary disease varied among clinics, so
the true prevalence of 'silent' biliary disease
could not be estimated.
Data about age at diagnosis of liver disease,
mode of presentation, history of prolonged
neonatal jaundice, family history, presence of
oesophageal varices, and liver function tests
were gathered. Where available, the age at
death and mode of death of patients attending
each of the four initial clinics were noted during
the 10 years preceding the study.
The prevalence point was 1 June 1988. The x2
test was used to assess the significance of differ￾ences among groups.
Results
There were similar trends in the prevalence of
clinically apparent disease in the data derived
from casenotes in the midlands and those
derived from databases in the northern survey.
The data have therefore been combined to give
a study population of 1100 patients with cystic

fibrosis. Of these, 46 (4-2%) had clinical liver
disease. Eleven (1-0%) had an enlarged liver
only, three (0-3%) had an enlarged spleen only,
and 32 (2 9%) had enlargement of both liver and
spleen. Cutaneous signs of liver disease were
recorded in only two.
Oesophageal varices had been sought in 34/46
with clinical disease, and were detected in 11.
Of these, all had enlarged spleens, and six had
bled at least once. There was no variceal bleed￾ing in patients who did not have enlarged
spleens. Six of 46 in the combined clinical group
(13-0%) had liver enzyme activities within the
reference ranges, and four also had enlarged
spleens.
No patient had jaundice or ascites at the time
of the study.
The prevalence of abnormal liver enzyme
activities in the absence of clinical disease could
be estimated only for the midlands group of
524: 50 were identified (9-5%). These repre￾sented 12 9% of those who had had liver
enzymes measured.
Clinically apparent and radiologically proved
biliary disease was rare and restricted to the
older age groups. Only six patients out of 1100
(0-55%) were found: one of 183 (0-5%) in the
16-20 age band, three of 107 (2 8%) in the
21-25 band, and two of 38 (4-6%) aged over 25
years.
AGE RELATED PREVALENCE (table 1)
There was a progressive rise in the prevalence of
clinically apparent liver disease from 0-3% in
the 0-5 age group to a peak of 8-7% among
those aged 16-20. Thereafter, instead of the
expected progressive rise, there was a fall to
only 4- 1% among 145 patients over 20 years of
age. The same trend was seen when only those
with splenomegaly were considered, or when
those who had neither an enlarged spleen nor
abnormal liver function tests were excluded.
The group with portal hypertension as indi￾cated by an enlarged spleen had a mean age of
15-3 years (range 7-27), and those with
oesophageal varices had a mean age of 17-3
years (range 9-27).
Biochemical abnormalities without clinical
signs were more prevalent than overt disease
(table 2), and showed a similar although less
pronounced peak, rising to 16-0% in the 16-20
age group, and falling to 11-5% over 20.
SEX RELATED PREVALENCE
Significantly more male patients were affected
by clinical disease, both in the midlands and in
the combined populations; 33/605 (5-4%) were
affected overall compared with 13/495 (2-6%) of
female patients, (p<005). The difference was
seen at all ages over 5 years, and was most pro￾nounced in the 11-15 age group, in which three
times as many boys as girls were affected. There
were no significant differences between the
sexes in the group with biochemical abnormali￾ties only, but prevalence data for this group was
incomplete.
AGE AT PRESENTATION OF LIVER DISEASE
Reliable information about the age at which
liver disease first became clinically apparent was
available for 39 of the 46 with clinical disease.
(table 3). The mean age at presentation was 9-8
years (median 10-5).
MODE OF PRESENTATION OF LIVER DISEASE
Of the 46 with clinical disease, it presented in 43
as an incidental finding on abdominal examina￾tion: 11 had enlarged liver only, three had
enlarged spleen only, and in 29 both organs
were enlarged. Two presented with abnormal
liver enzyme activities and later progressed to
overt disease; one presented with biliary pain.
None of the patients presented with prolonged
neonatal jaundice. Two presented with hepatos￾plenomegaly before the diagnosis of cystic fibro￾sis was made.
SIBLINGS
There were no sibling pairs within the total
group of 46 patients with clinical liver disease,
although nine of the 46 had one or more siblings
with cystic fibrosis. Two, however, had siblings
who had died and were known to have had liver
disease. At least two had siblings with abnormal
liver enzyme activities.

CAUSE OF DEATH
The causes of death among those attending the
midlands clinics over the past 10 years were reli￾ably ascertained in 80%. For the others records
were unavailable, or death had occurred at
home and the precise mode had not been
recorded. There were 77 deaths during this
period (31 male, 46 female), and their mean age
was 13-9 years. Only two patients died from
acute variceal haemorrhage, and only four from
acute liver failure. The mean age at death of
these six (three male, three female) was 10-8
years. The remainder died primarily from
respiratory causes, but at least six of these had
some degree of liver disease.
Discussion
There have been no previous systematic
attempts to assess the clinical prevalence of liver
disease among patients with cystic fibrosis
across the entire age range in a substantial popu￾lation. Feigelson et al, using a variety of criteria,
found evidence of cirrhosis in nine of 50
patients with cystic fibrosis between 1 and 20
years old.'6 Stern et al described 15 cases with
symptomatic liver disease in a population of
693 (2-2%). 14 Schwarz et al reported nine cases
of overt liver disease among 204 patients all
less than 13 years old (4-4%). 17 More recently,
Nagel et al reported either biochemical or overt
liver disease in 57 of 233 patients over 15 years
old (24.5%). 18
Necropsy studies have shown overall rates of
abnormal histological appeareances of the liver
of 12%,19 22%,5 and 29 5%." The latter series
(n= 146) suggested an increasing prevalence
with age from 10-8% at less than 3 months to
26-8% at over 1 year. Vawter and Schwachman
found focal biliary changes in 21 of 29 patients
who died after the age of 24 years (72%). 12 Nec￾ropsy data may not reflect the true age related
prevalence as the presence of liver disease may
have contributed to death. None of the pub￾lished necropsy studies relate the histopatholo￾gical findings to clinical condition, or to radiolo￾gical or biochemical abnormalities.
Varying estimates of the prevalence of abnor￾malities shown on ultrasound scanning have
also been reported. Willi et al performed scans
in 24 unselected patients and found abnormali￾ties in 22 (92%), of whom 10 had specific liver
abnormalities.20 Graham et al (in an adult series)
found hepatomegaly in 23 of 35 (66%) and
abnormal echogenicity in 11 of 35 (31%),21 and
Wilson-Sharp et al found hepatic abnormalities
in 23% of children.22
Data on the results of examination of liver
biopsy specimens in patients with cystic fibrosis
are scarce, although Dietzsch et al found histo￾logical evidence of liver disease in 15 of 84 chil￾dren who underwent needle biopsy (18%).15
Not all those whose biopsy specimens were
abnormal had either clinical or biochemical evi￾dence of liver disease. Trying to identify subcli￾nical liver disease by biopsy is impossible to jus￾tify in the absence of any treatment, except in
assessment for transplantation.
Thus the assumption of a rising prevalence of
liver disease with age in cystic fibrosis is based
23
mainly on necropsy series. In the present
study the prevalence of clinically overt disease
in 1100 patients with cystic fibrosis was 4-4%,
similar to some quoted estimates.'0 23 This is
likely to be an underestimate of the true preva￾lence of focal biliary cirrhosis, as the histopatho￾logical changes may precede enlargement of the
liver or the development of portal hypertension.
The presence of an enlarged liver in isolation,
with no other evidence of liver disease, should
be interpreted with caution because this may be
the result of depression of a normal liver below
the costal margin by hyperinflated lungs, rather
than true enlargement. Measuring the liver span
by percussion is difficult in patients with cystic
fibrosis because the chest is frequently hyper￾resonant throughout. In our series, however,
only four patients had isolated liver enlargement
with neither splenomegaly nor abnormal liver
function tests, and when these were excluded
the same trends in age and sex prevalence were
seen.
Liver disease was relatively uncommon
before the age of 10 years. Some of the younger
patients may have had hepatic steatosis related
to poor nutrition rather than cirrhosis.24 There￾after, instead of the expected progressive rise
into adult life, there was a peak during adolesc￾ence followed by a fall in prevalence over the
age of 20 years.
There are two possible explanations for this
observation. Firstly, it may be an unexplained
cohort effect, and further longitudinal studies
would show whether the prevalence peak shifts
into adult life. Alternatively, because liver
disease in cystic fibrosis is irreversible, this
trend can be explained by an increase in mortal￾ity in the teenage years among those with liver
disease. Our review of mortality records for the
preceding 10 years showed that only 7-8% of
deaths could be attributed directly to liver
disease, either hepatocellular failure or portal
hypertension. It may therefore be that the pre￾sence of liver disease increases the likelihood of
premature respiratory death in teenage patients
with cystic fibrosis. The rarity of hepatocellular
failure as a cause of death may be explained by
the histopathology of focal biliary cirrhosis, in
which the hepatic parenchyma is left largely
intact.3 4
The sex distribution of overt disease showed
an unexpected preponderance of male patients.
No other manifestation of cystic fibrosis shows
such a sex difference. It cannot be attributed to
the action of sex hormones, as the onset was
usually prepubertal. Recently, Becker et al
showed that female patients with cystic fibrosis
had significantly more cholesterol saturation of
bile than male patients, but this difference was
seen only after puberty. There is reported to be
a higher mortality from cystic fibrosis among
female compared with male patients in the
United Kingdom as a whole,2 and it is possible
that increased mortality among girls with liver
disease explains our findings.
Although these data are derived from patients
attending specialist cystic fibrosis clinics, and
may thus be somewhat selected, they include
most of the patients with cystic fibrosis living in
the areas served by the clinics. No patients were

Prevalence ofliver disease in cystic fibrosis 701
referred specifically because of liver disease.
There is no reason to suppose that the observed
trends should be any different for patients who
were not attending the clinics.
The findings in the 'biochemical' group,
derived from the smaller midlands population
only, should be interpreted with caution as
there was no consistent policy of monitoring
liver enzyme activities among the clinics. Some
patients had never had liver function tests done,
and in others, increased activities may have
been the result of causes other than developing
cirrhosis. Liver function tests were carried out
more often in older patients. Despite the in￾complete data the same age prevalence trend
was seen as in patients with overt disease.
Like other authors, we found an inconsistent
relationship between hepatosplenomegaly and
abnormal liver enzyme activities. Kattwinkel et
al in their study of liver enzyme activities in
patients with cystic fibrosis compared with age
matched controls found that 15/40 (38%) had.
raised alkaline phosphatase liver isoenzyme
activity.13 They also found raised y-glutamyl
transpeptidase, aspartate aminotransferase, and
alanine aminotransferase activities in a simi￾lar proportion of patients, but only six of 11
patients with palpable livers had abnormal tests,
while 11/38 whose livers were not palpable had
abnormal tests. We therefore doubt the value of
routine monitoring of liver enzyme activities in
patients with cystic fibrosis. No evidence has
been published to establish the value of other
biochemical or haematological tests, including
dynamic tests of liver function such as caffeine
clearance, in predicting the later occurrence of
overt disease.
Subclinical biliary disease is thought to be
common among adults with cystic fibrosis. In
one study 17 of 23 adults with abnormal liver
enzyme activities had abnormalities on biliary
imaging,'8 and this was suggested to be the
primary hepatobiliary lesion in cystic fibrosis.7
We found symptoms of biliary disease to be
rare.
The mode of presentation of liver disease was
by routine abdominal examination in most
patients, and in only two of 46 of the clinical
group (4%) was the development of overt dis￾ease predicted by abnormal liver function tests.
We found no strong evidence of familial con￾cordance as reported by Schuster et al.26
As expected, 20% of those with overt disease
had oesophageal varices although, because not
all patients had been recently investigated, the
true incidence may have been higher. Enlarge￾ment of the spleen seems to predict those at risk
from haemorrhage.
In conclusion, these data suggest that the pre￾valence of liver disease in cystic fibrosis peaks
during adolescence, affects male more than
female patients, and seems to be associated with
earlier death. Those with liver disease may thus
form an identifiable group with a worse prog￾nosis who warrant more aggressive treatment.
Poor nutritional state associated with liver dis￾ease may contribute to the shorter life span, but
data are lacking. Clinical signs are probably a
late sign of liver disease, but results of liver
function tests are unreliable. The cause, future
changes in prevalence, and the prognosis of
liver disease in cystic fibrosis demand further
study.

study. We also thank colleagues in the cystic fibrosis clinics in
Leicester, Nottingham, Birmingham,. Peterborough, Leeds,
