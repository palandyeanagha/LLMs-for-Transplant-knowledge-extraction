The crucial role of macrophages 
in lymphangiogenesis
Dontscho Kerjaschki

Lymphangiogenesis is associated with pathological processes such as the met￾astatic spread of carcinoma cells and organization of immunologically active
lymphocytic infiltrates following organ transplantation. It has not yet been
established whether expansion ofthe lymphatic vascular meshwork is driven
by incorporation of progenitor cells or by local endothelial cell division. In
this issue ofthe JCI,Maruyama et al. provide evidence that after mouse corne￾altransplant,CD11b+ macrophages infiltrate the corneal stroma and transdif￾ferentiate into lymphatic endothelial cell clusters thatjoin existing lymphatic
vessels (see the related article beginning on page 2363). In complementary
in vitro experiments, murine peritoneal macrophages expressed lymphatic
endothelial markers and formed vessel-like protrusions. These findings add
yet another facetto the plasticity of macrophages, which are already known to
transform from naive monocytes intoVEGF-C–producing cells.Thus, macro￾phages support lymphangiogenesis in 2 different ways, either by transdiffer￾entiating and directly incorporating into the endothelial layer or by stimulat￾ing division of preexistent local lymphatic endothelial cells.
Themolecularbiology andpathologyoflym￾phatic vessels and their endothelial cells has
been one of the most rapidly growing fields
of vascular biology in recent years. Histori￾cally, ancient anatomists visually recognized
the larger vessels of the lymphatic system by
their ability to collectintradermally injected
tracers. About 40 years ago, the pioneering
work of Leak and Burke established mor￾phological differences between lymphatic
and blood vessels, and the first attempts
were made to culture lymphatic endothelial
cells(1). However, as no specific marker pro￾teinsthat were exclusively expressed by lym￾phatic endothelial cells had been discovered,
characterization and tissue localization of
lymphatics remained elusive. Some of the
earliest landmark findings in this field are
considered to be the discovery of the lym￾phatic endothelial cell–specific growth fac￾tor VEGF-C and its tyrosine kinase recep￾tor, VEGFR-3 (2), which was followed by
the discovery of podoplanin, a membrane
mucoprotein expressed abundantly in lym￾phatic endothelial cells (3); the CD44-relat￾ed hyaluronic acid receptor LYVE-1 (4); and
the transcription factor PROX-1 (5), which
presumably serves as a masterswitch forthe
lymphatic phenotype of endothelial cells
(6, 7). With this knowledge it was possible
to isolate pure lymphatic endothelial cells
and grow them in tissue culture (8, 9) and
to precisely localize lymphatics in tissues in
health and disease.
Our rapidly evolving understanding of
the basic aspects of lymphatic endothelial
cell biology has prompted examination
of the mechanisms of pathological lym￾phangiogenesis. In this issue of the JCI,
Maruyama et al. (10) provide what is
believed to be the first direct evidence that,
following mouse corneal transplantation,
CD11b+ macrophages are able to transdif￾ferentiate into lymphatic endothelial cells.
Thisfinding represents an important mile￾stone in our understanding of the contri￾bution of cells of the innate immune sys￾tem to pathological lymphangiogenesis.
How do lymphatic vessels grow?
Extension of vessels occurs by 2 alternative
mechanisms: mitosis of endothelial cells
and vascular sprouting or appositional
growth involving integration of endothelial
progenitor cells at sites of extension. In the
blood vasculature, evidence for the occur￾rence of bothmechanismswas establishedin
animal experiments; however, a major caveat
against generalization of these results has
been the lack of relevance of these findings
to human diseases. While a more realistic
picture of the mechanisms of angiogenesis
is now slowly emerging from cumbersome
studies on human tissues (11), very little is
known by comparison about the mecha￾nisms of lymphangiogenesis. Previously, de
novo lymphangiogenesis has been observed
in mature mouse models following trans￾genic overexpression of VEGF-C in mouse
basal keratinocytes(2) orin pancreatic islets
(12, 13) and was also found to occur in and
around human squamous epithelial carci￾nomas(14). An especially favorable location
in which to study lymphangiogenesis by
direct microscopy is the cornea (reviewed in
ref. 15). While the normal cornea is devoid
of blood and lymphatic vessels, both vessel
types invade the cornea following corneal
disease and surgery or transplant. In the
context of the Maruyama et al. study (10),
itisimportantto note thatlymphangiogen￾esis occurs in the inflammatory setting of
corneal transplantation, and the results of
this study have now provided the first clue
to my knowledge regarding the direct par￾ticipation of macrophagesin this process.
Macrophage transdifferentiation: the 
missing link in lymphangiogenesis
A cardinal question in adult lymphangio￾genesis is whether endothelial cells in new
vessels are derived from circulating progeni￾tors or from local preexisting vessels by cell
division and sprouting. The firstindications
of a role for local endothelial cell sprouting
in lymphangiogenesiswere derived from ele￾gant experimentsinwhichsublethally irradi￾ated mice were grafted with GFP-expressing
bone marrow(16).Afterinduction of dermal
lymphatic vessel proliferation, it was found
that not a single lymphatic endothelial cell
was derived from the donor’s bone marrow.
By contrast, there are also some indications
of the existence of circulating lymphatic
endothelial progenitor cells,which constitu￾tively express VEGFR-3 on theirsurface and
express lymphatic endothelial cell–specific
proteinsin culture. One potential lymphatic
progenitor lineage was isolated as a minor
subtraction from human hemangioblast
preparations (17). Remarkably, however,

a major proportion of human circulating
CD14+ naive monocytes also constitutively
expressed VEGFR-3, and it was speculated
that these cells are the source of VEGF-C–
expressing tissue macrophagesin the tumor
stroma (14) and in inflammatory infiltrates
in transplanted kidney and cornea (18, 19).
In their present study (10), Maruyama and
colleagues provide the first evidence to my
knowledge that macrophages transdiffer￾entiate in a stepwise fashion into lymphatic
endothelial cells, initially forming cell aggre￾gatesthat presumably develop into morula￾like vesicles and then integrate into sprout￾ing lymphatic vessels. This was confirmed
by the authors’ finding that ablation of
macrophages by treatment with clodronate
liposomes completely abolished corneal

lymphangiogenesis. Moreover, under appro￾priate in vitro culture conditions, activated
murine peritoneal CD11b+ macrophages
formed tube-like structures and expressed
some lymphatic endothelial cell–specific
markers. Taken together, these data provide
strong evidence that CD11b+ macrophages
possess the capacity to transdifferentiate
into lymphatic endothelial cells.
However, macrophages appear to also
play an alternative role in lymphangiogen￾esis, in that a subpopulation of these cells is
reprogrammed to produce large amounts of
VEGF-C and thus induce local sprouting of
preexisting lymphatic endothelial cells. The
first suggestion of such a mechanism fol￾lowed the observation that activated murine
macrophages express VEGFR-3 and are che￾motactically attracted by VEGF-C in vitro
(20), which was then followed by the obser￾vation that a subset of peritumoral-activated
macrophages express VEGF-C and presum￾ably contribute toperitumorallymphatic ves￾sel expansion (14). Subsequently, VEGF-C–
producing macrophages were found to par￾ticipate in lymphangiogenesis in human
renal transplant rejection (19) and in the
mouse trachea after induction of inflam￾mation by inoculation with tubercle bacte￾ria (21). It remains to be established which
factors determine the fate and regulate the
differentiation of tissue macrophages, be
they involved in the induction of preexisting
endothelial cell sprouting or transdifferen￾tiation into lymphatic endothelial cells.
Lymphatic vessel function revisited
Given all the efforts in the last few years
to gain further insight into lymphatic
endothelial biology and to better understand
the molecular mechanisms of lymphan￾giogenesis, the question arises as to whether
these investments are justified in view of
recent insights into lymphatic vessel func￾tion. The traditionally acknowledged func￾tions of lymphatic vessels include collection
of interstitial tissue fluid and cells, drainage
to the next lymph node for “immunological
inspection,” and recirculation to the venous
blood system via the thoracic duct. Recent
data suggest that these functions are not
caused by a passive process butinvolve rapid
and highly efficient transport (22). For a
long time, it has been known that interrup￾tion of lymphatic fluid transport either by
vascular malformations or surgical inter￾ventionsresulted in lymphedema. Although
lymphatic endothelial cells are endowedwith
caveolae and other cellular organelles that
mediate endo- and/or transcytosis (8, 23),
the traditional view persists that fluid and
solutes enter the lymphatic lumen passively
via the paracellular pathway through leaky
intercellular junctions that differ in their
molecular composition from those of blood
vascular endothelial cells (8). Recently, evi￾dencewas provided thatthistransport path￾way for solutes is of paramount importance
not only for fluid homeostasis in normal
tissues, but also for metastatic dissemina￾tion oftumors. Apparently, metastasis-com￾petent primary tumors produce and secrete
lymphoendotheliotrophic factors, which
are collected by regional lymphatics and
drained into the sentinel lymph node. Here
they cause transformation ofsinuses and/or
genuine intranodal lymphangiogenesis as a
prelude for adhesion of metastasizing tumor
cells, thussubstantiating the “seed and soil”
hypothesis of tumor dissemination (24).
Of interest is the interaction of inflamma￾tory cells with lymphatic endothelium. This
is obviously important in the migration of
antigen-loaded dendritic cells ortumor cells
that find their way to the next lymphatic
vessel and transmigrate into the vascular
lumen. The molecular mechanisms govern￾ing these processes are currently underinves￾tigation because targeted disruption of this
pathway could be of therapeutic use. In the
unique situation of lymphangiogenesis in
renaltransplants and the association oflym￾phatics with active lymphocytic infiltrates,
a potential mechanism was delineated that
involves secretion of the chemokines SLC/
CCL21 by lymphatic endothelial cells and
consequent attraction of CCR7+ lympho￾cytes and dendritic cells(19). Thus, it is pos￾sible thatlymphatic endothelial cells orches￾trate the formation of (tertiary) lymphatic
organs. These selected examples highlight
unanticipated, yet important, functions of
lymphatic vesselsthat can now be unraveled
with newly available molecularinstruments,
and itissafe to predictthatsurprises are still
ahead of us.
Perspective
In summary, the novel data reported by
Maruyama et al. (10) indicate that macro￾phages apparently play 2 different roles in
lymphangiogenesis (Figure 1). They may
serve as a source of VEGF-C and thus trig￾ger growth or hyperplasia of lymphatic ves￾sels through the sprouting of preexistent
lymphatics. Alternatively, macrophages
may transdifferentiate into lymphatic
endothelial cells.
A hallmark of good research is that it
opens a door to a new room with many
other doors. In describing a novel role for
tissue macrophagesin lymphangiogenesis,
Maruyama et al. (10) have done just that.
One obvious emerging question prompted
by this research is whether the concept of
appositional growth of lymphatics and
involvement of circulation-derived precur￾sors is a general phenomenon or whether
it is context-dependent and occurs, for
example, only when rapid lymphangiogen￾esis takes place, as is the case with inflam￾mation in the transplanted cornea. Also,
the relation ofthese chameleon-like macro￾phages to circulating precursors such as
CD14+ monocytes needs to be explored.
Finally, as the ultimate goal of biomedical
research is to learn about the pathogenesis
of human diseases and to develop pre￾cisely targeted therapies, the contribution
of macrophages to pathologic lymphan￾giogenesis needs to also be established
in humans. As in many other instances,
the elegant experiments performed here
in mice (10) will undoubtedly provide an
important landmark in the journey into
the essentially uncharted territory of lym￾phatic vessel function in human disease.

Searching for transcriptional regulators 
of Ang II–induced vascular pathology

Ang II plays a key role in cardiovascular regulation and participates in
vascular pathobiology, including inflammation and remodeling. Whether
these tissue effects are mediated by direct Ang II actions or indirectly as a
result ofits influence on hemodynamics is being debated.In vitro data have
shown that Ang II induces vascular cellular transcriptional activation and
gene expression, but the mechanisms explaining its long-term tissue effects
in vivo are relatively unknown. Do the multiple in vivo vascular activities
elicited by Ang II (such as inflammation, fibrosis, and vascular cell hyper￾trophy/proliferation) occur via independent pathways, or do common tran￾scription mechanisms mediate these multiple effects? In this issue, Zhan
et al. identify Ets-1 as a critical downstream transcriptional mediator of
vascular inflammation and remodeling in vivo; their data suggest that Ets-1
may be a common denominator of a complex process that involves multi￾ple pathways previously considered to be mechanistically independent (see
the related article beginning on page 2508). Characterization of the critical
transcription programs activated by Ang IIin vivo and determination ofthe
hierarchy of responses are vital to the understanding of the mechanism of
vascular disease and to the development of therapies targeted at inhibiting
the common transcription effectors of vascular pathology.
Inflammation and structural remodeling
are essential processes mediating vascular
responses to humoral and hemodynamic
stimuli and have been shown to be involved
in the mechanism of vascular disease. Over
the past several years, experimental and
clinical evidence has demonstrated a key
role of Ang II in these processes and that
blockade of the renin-angiotensin system
(RAS) inhibits vascular inflammation and
remodeling and reduces clinical vascu￾lar complications. However, an ongoing
debate exists with respect to the cardio￾vascular actions of Ang II and prompts the
following questions: (a) Does Ang II have
direct in vivo vascular actions indepen￾dent of its effects on blood pressure? (b)
How does Ang II exert its long-term effects
in tissue? and (c) Are the multiple Ang
II–induced vascular pathologic processes
(i.e., inflammation, fibrosis, and prolifera￾tion) mediated by common downstream
transcription factor(s)?
Certainly, it has been difficult to dis￾sect, in either in vivo or in vitro studies,
the direct effect of Ang II on tissue from
the indirect effects resulting from its
influence on hemodynamics. Clarifying
how the effects of Ang II are mediated will
be of great clinical relevance, particularly
with respect to the question of whether
drugs that block RAS (e.g., angiotensin￾converting enzyme inhibitors and Ang II
receptor blockers) will have any added
value beyond their traditional role as
blood pressure–lowering agents. Although
many in vitro studies have shown that
Ang II activates signal transduction path￾ways, transcriptional activation, and gene
expression, these studies have focused on
acute experimental conditions, and data
explaining the long-term cardiovascular
actions of Ang II are lacking. The mecha￾Nonstandard abbreviations used: KLF5, Krüppel-like
