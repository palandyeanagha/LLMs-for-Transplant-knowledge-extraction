Abstract
Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) and primary sclerosing cholangitis 
(PSC) are both autoimmune cholestatic liver disease and the as￾sociation of these two conditions in the same patient is very rare. 
We report the case of a female patient presenting with a choles￾tatic liver disease and a panel of autoantibodies specific for PBC, 
including antibodies to mitochondrial E2-pyruvate dehydrogenase, 
gp-210 and Sp-100. Beside these findings, the liver biopsy revealed 
concentric fibrosis of small biliary ducts and the magnetic reso￾nance cholangiography presented no abnormal findings. Diagnosis 
of small duct PSC/PBC overlapping was done. No description of 
this association was found in the literature. Clinical and serological 
features of this unusual finding are discussed.

Introduction
Although the etiology of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), 
primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and autoimmune hepa￾titis (AIH) remains unknown, there are several case reports 
of association of these hepatic autoimmune conditions in the 
same patient [1-4]. The expression “overlapping syndrome” 
has been used to describe forms of auto-immune disease, 
generally AIH/PBC or AIH/PSC, that present typical char￾acteristics of more than one condition in the same patient, 
occurring simultaneously or sequentially, and sometimes mi￾grating from one to another clinical presentation [3-6]. How￾ever, overlapping between PBC/PSC is much less described.
PBC is mostly prevalent among women, causing de￾struction of biliary ducts, resulting in progressive ductope￾nia and cirrhosis. AMA is considered a specific biomarker of 
PBC and some authors describe it as the serologic signature 
of the disease [7, 8]. PSC, in its turn, is also a chronic cho￾lestatic liver disease of unknown etiology, typically marked 
by progressive inflammation and concentric fibrosis of intra￾or extra-hepatic biliary ducts, causing cirrhosis, liver failure 
and high incidence of cholangiocarcinoma [9-11]. So far, 
there are no specific serological markers for PSC and AMA 
is virtually absent in PSC patients [12-14].
To our knowledge, there are only five PBC/PSC over￾lapping cases reported in the literature, none of them cor￾responding to small biliary duct PSC [15-18].
Here we describe a patient with clinical, biochemical 
and serological markers of PBC, whose biopsy was compat￾ible with small duct PSC.
Case Report
A 48-year-old woman was referred to the hepatologist in or￾der to investigate elevated levels of liver enzymes. Except 
for a treated systemic hypertension, mild obesity and a ten￾year irregular use of amfepramone, she had no remarkable 
medical history. She also had no familiar history of liver dis￾ease or alcohol consumption. Physical examination revealed 
only mild hepatomegaly.
Laboratory tests are summarized in Table 1. She present￾ed a positive antinuclear antibody (ANA) test (titer > 1/640) 
with a rim-like membranous and cytoplasmic speckled pat￾tern, suggestive of anti-mitochondrial positivity (Fig. 1). 
These ANA patterns are known to be associated to antibod￾ies to gp210 and mitocondrial antigens, respectively. Indirect 
immunofluorescence (IIF) tests for anti-smooth muscle anti￾bodies (SMA), anti-liver/kidney microsome 1 (LKM-1), and 
neutrophil cytoplasm antigens (ANCA) were negative. IIF￾Manuscript accepted for publication July 20, 2012

AMA on in-house rodent tissue preparations was performed 
as previously described [19] and was positive at 1/160. 
Anti-pyruvate dehydrogenase antibodies (anti-M2 fraction) 
were positive and detected by enzyme immunosorbent as￾say (ELISA-Orgentec, Mainz, Germany). There was also 
reactivity for anti-M2-E3 BPO, anti-gp210 and anti-Sp-100 
(Euroline profile, Euroimmun, Lubeck, Germany).
Liver biopsy revealed bridging portal fibrosis, lympho￾mononuclear infiltrate with lymphocytic interface hepatitis 
and marginal ductular reaction. Surprisingly, some of the 
portal tracts revealed small biliary ducts with concentric fi￾brosis (“onion skin” type) with duct obliteration (Fig. 2, 3). 
Magnetic resonance cholangiography was then performed, 
with normal findings. Diagnosis of small duct PSC was done, 
and she was treated with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) with 
progressive normalization of liver enzymes within 4 months.
Discussion
The classically described overlapping syndrome is charac￾terized by diagnosis of more than one form of autoimmune 
liver disease in the same patient [1-5]. If not correctly di￾agnosed and appropriately treated, its course can be more 
aggressive as compared to isolated forms [20, 21]. It is a 
matter of discussion if overlapping syndromes are isolated 
entities or different manifestations of a unique autoimmune 
liver disease [1, 2, 6].
Overlapping between PBC/AIH, AMA-negative PBC/
AIH, and PSC/AIH, have been related in different series [3, 
5, 22-24]. However, few cases of overlapping between PBC/
PSC have been reported [15-18]. As both PBC and PSC are 
cholestatic diseases presenting with increased AP and GGT, 
overlapping of these two conditions could occasionally not 
be perceived.
The patient herein reported presented an unremarkable 
clinical picture represented by the incidental finding of bio￾chemical evidence of cholestatic disease, which might be 
suitable to both PBC and PSC. The serologic investigation 
initially performed was vigorously suggestive of PBC, with 
a positive a panel of autoantibodies specific for this disease, 
including antibodies to mitochondrial E2-pyruvate dehydro￾genase (AMA M2), gp-210 and Sp-100.
AMA may be considered one of the most useful param￾eters for the diagnosis of cholestatic liver diseases, since 
AMA is virtually absent in PSC patients compared to over 
95% prevalence in PBC [7, 12-14, 25]. Other autoantibodies, 
such as anti-gp-210 and anti-Sp-100, are also specifically as￾sociated with PBC [26]. Anti-gp-210 has been associated to 
a more aggressive course of the disease [27, 28] whereas an￾ti-Sp-100 is considered highly specific (specificity of 95%), 
despite its low sensitivity (around 30%) [27-29]. These 
PBC-associated autoantibodies elicit peculiar ANA patterns, 
such as the cytoplasmic reticule-like speckled pattern (asso￾ciated with AMA) [30], the multiple nuclear dots pattern (as￾sociated to anti-Sp100 antibodies), the rim-like membranous 
pattern (linked to positivity to anti-gp210 antibodies), and 
the centromeric pattern [26-28].
Despite all these evidences for the diagnosis of PBC in 
the present case, the histological examination was not char￾Figure 1. Indirect immunofluorescence on HEp-2 cells (Bion

acteristic of the disease; instead, it showed typical onion-skin 
lesions in biliary ducts, with concentric fibrosis, compatible 
with PSC, a non-expected finding in face of the serological 
findings.
The diagnosis of PSC is confirmed by the demonstration 
of typical lesions of the biliary tree, either by histological 
analysis or by imaging techniques (endoscopic cholangiog￾raphy or MRI) [31, 32]. Patients who present with clinical, 
biochemical and histological features compatible with PSC, 
but have a normal cholangiogram, are classified as small 
duct PSC [31, 33]. The histological hallmark of PSC is rep￾resented by concentric fibrosis of bile ducts; however, this 
finding is detected in only 30 to 40% of patients with PSC 
[31, 34-36]. Onion-skin fibrosis can also be found in second￾ary sclerosing cholangitis, but the patient reported here had 
no identified cause to this condition [31].
Autoantibodies are often found in PSC patients, but 
none of them have enough sensitivity and/or specificity to 
be considered a diagnostic maker. Autoantibodies regularly 
described in PSC include ANA (8-77%), SMA (0-83%), and 
pANCA (26-94%), usually in low titers [12-14, 37].
Description of overlapping between PBC and PSC is 
very uncommon. After revision of literature, only five re￾ports of PBC/PSC overlapping syndromes were identified 
[15-18]. MRI was normal in the present patient, leading to 
the diagnosis of small duct PSC/PBC overlapping. To the 
best of our knowledge, this is the first report of small duct 
PSC overlapping with PBC. As she presented positivity to 
gp210, prognosis is a matter of awareness, even in the pres￾ence of small duct PSC, a condition with better prognosis 
than large duct PSC [38, 39]. We have not enough follow 
up for evaluating prognosis in this case. After five years, re￾sponse to treatment has been satisfactory.
In conclusion, we describe a female patient with features 
of PBC and small duct PSC, a diagnosis that would remain 
undiscovered if histology was not performed. This finding 
has important and controversial clinical implications, such 
as the management of treatment and the need of screening 
for cholangiocarcinoma [32]. This case is emblematic of 
how complex diagnosis of liver autoimmune diseases can 
be, and reinforces the impression that these are polymorphic 
entities that can express different patterns of autoantibodies 
and histological findings, making the diagnosis of these con￾ditions particularly challenging.
