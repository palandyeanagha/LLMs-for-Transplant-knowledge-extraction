Abstract
The 4T1 murine mammary carcinoma is an experimental model widely used in assessing and better understanding 
of tumor biology. It is a highly tumorigenic cell line and invasive, where metastases are observed in various organs. This 
study aims to describe morphological and immunophenotipical aspects of 4T1 mammary carcinoma in mice Balb/c with the 
aid of the immunohistochemistry. Tissues were fixed in formalin and processed using the routine paraffin inclusion 
technique. Histologic sections (4 µm) were stained through Hematoxylin-Eosin techniques for morphologic assessments. 
For immunohistochemical study, we used a panel of 9 (nine) antibodies: hormone receptors, receptors for cell proliferation, 
cytokeratins, vimentin, growth factor receptor and markers of blood vessels. Morphologically, the 4T1 murine mammary 
carcinoma shows malignant epithelial proliferation in solid arrangement, with pleomorphic cells and high mitotic index. In 
immunohistochemical analysis was determined a positivity for hormone receptors, cytokeratin AE1/AE3, receptors of cell 
proliferation and markers of blood vessels. There was a negative for vimentin, cytokeratin 5/6, cytokeratin 34βE12 and 
growth factor receptor.The results show that the characteristics observed in this model are similar to some types of breast 
cancers found in women like poorly differentiated invasive ductal carcinoma. Thus, the immunophenotypic characterization 
of mammary carcinoma 4T1 allows a better understanding of the model to the study of new anticancer therapies. 
Key words: mouse, mammary gland, 4T1 cells and immunohistochemistry.
Introduction
The experimental transplantable tumors have been 
used in different studies of carcinogenesis (11,27). These 
tumors are considered appropriate models, and valid in the 
study of the progression and cancer therapy in different 
studies (31).
In addition, animals used as a study model have 
similarities in their physiology, biochemistry, metabolism 
and genetics in relation to humans, which ensures their use 
in research contributing to the discovery of new 
treatments.
Among the various experimental tumors used in 
research, we highlight the 4T1 murine mammary 
carcinoma. 4T1 is a highly tumorigenic cell line, little 
immunogenic with characteristics of growth and metastasis 
of tumor cells similar to human mammary gland in stage 
IV (31). Morphologically, the 4T1 mammary carcinoma 
shows malignant epithelial growth in solid arrangement, 
characterized by the proliferation of pleomorphic cells and 
high mitotic index.
Previous studies with the 4T1 tumor demonstrate 
possibilities for its use as a model in experimental cancer 
therapy (20, 37). However, research is needed to establish

appropriate proposals for oncological evaluation of this 
model.
In humans some immunohistochemical markers 
are known to assist in the characterization of breast cancer, 
contributing to the predictive and prognostic evaluation of
these tumors. These markers include estrogen receptor 
(ER) (7, 23), progesterone receptor (PR) (7, 23), 
cytokeratin 5/6 (41), cytokeratin 34βE12 (15), HER-2 (28), 
MIB-I (38), CD31 (8).
At present, immunohistochemistry is accepted as 
standard evaluation method worldwide. The 
immunohistochemistry detects protein products in tissue 
sections. It enables us to observe protein expression at the 
individual cell level in the tumor mass (40). With the 
advent of this tool, the immunophenotypic profile may be 
useful in understanding the biological character of tumors. 
In this sense, to our knowledge, this is the first work that 
describes the morphological and immunophenotypic 
characteristics of the 4T1 murine mammary carcinoma.
Therefore, this paper aims to describe the 
immunophenotypic profile of 4T1 murine mammary 
carcinoma by immunohistochemical technique. 
Materials and Methods
4T1 cells (American Type Culture Collection, 
Manasssas, VA) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium 
(Hyclone, Logan, UT) containing 10% FBS, at 37oC in a 
humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2.
Five female Balb/c mice (6 Weeks, 20g weight) 
were provided by the Animal Facility Center – Institute of 
Biological Science – Federal University of Minas Gerais; 
Belo Horizonte -Brazil. Housing, anesthesia and care were 
provided according to guidelines established by local 
Institutional Animal Welfare Committee.
4T1 cells in log phase of growth were harvested 
and suspended in PBS at a density of 2.5 x 106 cells/mL. 
100 µl of the suspension was injected in the right posterior 
flank of all animals, to obtain a solid tumor.
After 28 days, necropsy was performed with 
removal of tumor for histopathological analysis. Tissues 
were fixed in formalin (10% w/v in phosphate-buffered 
saline – PBS pH 7.4), processed using the routine paraffin 
inclusion technique (30). Histologic sections (4 µm) were 
stained through Hematoxylin-Eosin techniques for 
morphologic assessments.
Furthermore, sections (4 µm) were obtained and 
mounted on silanized slides for immunohistochemical 
study. A panel of antibodies was used (Table 1). Heat￾induced epitope retrieval using Dako antigen retrieval 
solution, pH 6.0 (Dako, Carpenteria, CA, USA), was 
performed before dipping the sections in a water bath (20 
minutes). The slides were then cooled at room temperature 
for 20 minutes in the antigen retrieval buffer. The sections 
were incubated at room temperature in 3% (vol/vol) H2O2 
for 15 min, in primary antibodies for 16 h at 4ºC or for 1h 
at room temperature (Table 1), in a reagent containing 
secondary antibodies (Advance HRP link, Dako, 
Carpenteria, CA, USA) for 30 min and a polymer reagent 
(Advance HRP enzyme, Dako, Carpenteria, CA, USA) for 
30 minutes. Between incubations, the slides were washed 
for 2 × 5 minutes in 10% phosphate-buffered saline 
solution. The immunoreactivity was visualised using 
diaminobenzidine (DAB substrate chromogen system, 
Dako, Carpenteria, CA, USA). The slides were then 
counterstained with Harris haematoxylin.

For determining of the expression of ER and PR 
was used American Society of Clinical Oncology / College 
of American Pathology (ASCO / CAP) (16), the evaluation 
of CDC47 was used orientation Souza et al. (36) and 
CD31 was evaluated according Maeda et al. (24). 
Evaluation of cytokeratin 34βE12 was performed 
according to Ferreira et al. (10). Vimentin and cytokeratin 
AE1/AE3 antibody was used orientation adapted of Bettini 
et al. (5). For determining the expression of HER-2 was 
used the American Society of Clinical Oncology / College 
of American Pathology (ASCO / CAP) (42).
Positive and negative control slides were included 
in each batch. As a positive control we used mouse 
mammary gland known to express of antibody (except 
HER-2). As positive control for this antibody was used a 
human mammary carcinoma with overexpression 
previously known for HER-2. Negative controls were 
assessed using normal serum (Ultra V Block, Laboratory 
Vision) as the primary antibody.

Results
All tissue sections were composed of proliferation 
of the epithelial cells organized in a solid arrangement, 
with the formation of cords, sheets or clusters surrounded 
by a fine fibrilar collagenous stroma (Figure 1A). The 
tumor cells exhibit moderate pleomorfism and have large, 
round or ovoid, often vesicular nuclei with single or 
multiple prominent nucleolus, abundant cytoplasm 
eosinophilic and indistinct cell borders. The mitotic rate 
ranged from two to three mitoses per 400x field and 
atypical mitoses were found. Tumors smaller than 0.5cm 
were central necrotic areas and inflammatory infiltrated 
composed of neutrophils and lymphocytes. 
The immunohistochemical results for ER, PR, 
HER-2, CK34βE12, CKAE1/AE3, CK5/6 and vimentin 
staining are shown in Table 2. All of the cases evaluated 
showed cytoplasmic staining for CKAE1/AE3 (Figure 1B), 
but were stained negative for cytokeratin 5/6 (5/5), 
cytokeratin 34βE12 (5/5) and vimentin (5/5). The tumors 
cells showed nuclear expression of hormonal receptors, ER 
(5/5) (Figure 1C) and PR (5/5). Negative staining for HER￾2 was observed in all of the cases. The proliferation index 
determined from the amount of nuclear staining for 
CDC47 ranged from 33.8% to 61.2% (mean 47.8%) 
(Figure 1D). The assessment of the vascularization of the 
tumors performed by determining the number of vessels in 
sections (five animals) staining for CD31 was of 13.96 
vessels/field.
Discussion
Numerous models have been developed for breast 
cancer research. All of these models to address key 
elements in the biology of breast cancer development and 
progression (18). The 4T1 murine mammary carcinoma is 
a widely used experimental model for characterization of 
cellular and molecular events during neoplasic progression 
(20,37). However, in literature there are few data on the 
morphological and immunophenotypical characteristics of 
4T1 murine mammary carcinoma.
Morphologically, the 4T1 mammary carcinoma 
shows malignant epithelial growth in solid arrangement, 
characterized by the proliferation of pleomorphic cells and 
high mitotic index. Our results show that the 
characteristics observed in this model are similar to some 
types of breast cancers found in women like poorly 
differentiated invasive ductal carcinoma (32).
Some factors determine the histogenesis and the 
biologic behavior of neoplasms as hormone receptors, 
receptors for cell proliferation, cytokeratins, vimentin, 
growth factor receptor and markers of blood vessels 
(7,8,28,38). In this study, we evaluated the 
immunohistochemical expression of several marker 
proteins.
Staining positive for cytokeratin AE1 / AE3 
confirm the epithelial origin of neoplasia. Cytokeratin 5/6 
and cytokeratin 34βE12 stain the basal layer of normal 
breast ductal epithelium (15,41) . CK 34βE12 is a widely 
used robust monoclonal antibody that identifies a number 
of high-molecular-weight keratins. CK 34βE12 recognizes 
basal keratins, including CK1, CK5, CK10 and CK14. 
CK5 and CK14 are widely used markers of basal

phenotype (25). In present study, the immunostaining for 
cytokeratin 5/6 and cytokeratin 34βE12 was negative. 
Metha et al. (25) showed that expression of 
34βE12 predicts disease-free and overall survival in 
patients with triple-negative tumors (negative 
immunostaining for estrogen, progesterone and HER-2 
receptors). Furthermore, it was observed that women with 
triple negative tumors that expressed cytokeratin 34βE12 
were associated with good prognosis.
Estrogen and progesterone have a role in normal 
mammary gland development and these hormones are 
implicated in the development of mammary tumors (23). 
In present study the tumors cells showed expression of 
hormonal receptors, ER and PR. Pervez et al. (29) 
described that expression these receptors relate to the 
degree of differentiation, the presence of metastases and 
response to hormonal therapy. Women with positive 
estrogen and receptor progesterone breast cancer has better 
prognosis than women with breast cancer negative 
estrogen and progesterone (3). 
Immunostaining of MIB-1 is widely used to 
assess tumor proliferation, and is an established prognostic 
factor in breast cancer. However, the evaluation of cell 
proliferation in an animal model most frequently used 
protein CDC47. Immunohistochemical expression of 
intranuclear CDC47 protein has been widely studied, and 
is associated with the stimulation of gene duplication 
necessary for cell division (9,26). The expression of this 
receptor is related with cells that are cycling 
(predominantly G1 and S phases) (19). Our results 
demonstrated a high proliferation index. In human 
medicine, Spyratos et al. (38) described that breast cancers 
expressing high levels of MIB-1 are associated with worse 
outcome.

Another important marker CD31 was assessed. 
The CD31 antibody widely used in the evaluation of 
vascularization in both normal and neoplastic tissues.
Reaction with protein (antigen) localized in the cytoplasm, 
have clinical applicability as a prognostic factor in several 
carcinomas, as well as being appropriate in the analysis of 
angiogenesis in breast tumors (12), colorectal cancer (39) 
and lung cancer (13). In murine mammary carcinoma 4T1 
was observed expression significant of vessels. These 
results are consistent with human medicine that correlates 
more angiogenic tumors are more aggressive and worse 
prognosis (8,12).
Changes in the structure and expression of proto￾oncogenes are involved in the origin and progression of 
tumors. One mechanism is the amplification and 
overexpression of members of the protein kinase gene 
family (33). Several tyrosine kinase genes, including HER￾2 are amplified in human breast cancer (34). In this study, 
the immunostaining for HER-2 was negative. These 
findings are similar to results reported by Heisig et al. (17). 
These authors used the 4T1 cell line as a negative control 
for models of stable transfection of her-2 gene. The degree 
of HER-2 amplification appears to have an effect on 
survival, with greater copy number being associated with a 
worse prognosis (34).
Therefore, the results suggest that the 
immunohistochemical murine mammary carcinoma 4T1 
resembles a luminal subtype, as described in humans ( 6). 
These authors used immunohistochemistry following 
definition: basal-like (ER−, PR−, HER-2−, cytokeratin 
5/6+, and/or HER-1+), HER-2+/ER− subtype (HER-2+, 
ER−, PR−), luminal A (ER+and/or PR+, HER-2−), and 
luminal B (ER+ and/or PR+, HER-2+). These human 
breast cancer subtypes predict distinct clinical outcomes 
(35). Thus, the results of this study may also corroborate 
studies using the 4T1 tumor as a comparative model for the 
investigation of treatment of breast cancer receptor￾positive ER (14, 43).
Curiously, these results were different of the 
immunohistochemical profile of the primary tumor and 
metastasis 4T1 as described by Bao et al. (4) and Kau et al. 
(21), respectively. These authors demonstrated that the 
metastasis and 4T1 cell line was negative for ER and PR 
and did not overexpress HER-2 (triple-negative). A 
possible explanation for this discrepant result may be the 
fact that they performed their assessment in 4T1 cell lines 
culture. Furthermore, the assessment of markers used was 
based on flow cytometry and Western blot analysis. Some 
authors describe that hormone receptor (ER and PR) status 
and HER-2 score are differently expressed between the 
primary tumor and corresponding metastases (1,2), 
therefore it is reasonable to assume that in vivo and in vitro 
tumors may present different protein expressions.
Another interesting fact is related with to 
similarity of immunophenotypic profile of 4T1 tumor with 
lobular carcinoma. Lakhani et al. (22) describe that the 
lobular carcinoma are frequently positive for ER and PR 
and rarely overexpress HER-2. Furthermore, in contrast to 
the majority of ductal lesions, lobular neoplasia is negative 
for E-cadherin in about 80-90% of cases. Approximately 
10-16% of cases will express E-cadherin, although this is 
usually aberrant and this pattern should not be used to 
make a diagnosis of ductal carcinoma. 
The results show that the characteristics observed 
in this model are similar to some types of breast cancers 
found in women like poorly differentiated invasive ductal 
carcinoma. Thus, the immunophenotypic characterization 
of mammary carcinoma 4T1 allows a better understanding 
of the model to the study of new anticancer therapies.
Conclusion
Based on the presented data, we may conclude 
that the morphological analysis of the 4T1 murine 
mammary carcinoma demonstrated characteristics of a 
poorly differentiated carcinoma. Similar characteristics can 
be observed in many cases of women breast cancer. Thus, 
morphological and immunophenotypical characterization 
of the 4T1 mammary carcinoma promotes a better 
understanding of the murine model for women breast 
cancer and enables tumoral behavior and new anticancer 
therapy studies.
