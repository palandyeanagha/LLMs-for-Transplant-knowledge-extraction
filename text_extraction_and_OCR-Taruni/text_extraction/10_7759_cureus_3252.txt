Abstract
Central pontine myelinolysis is a rare condition arising from the myelinolysis of white matter
tracts in the pons, most commonly in response to iatrogenic hypertonic stress caused by the
rapid correction of hyponatremia. Here, we present an interesting case of central pontine
myelinolysis subsequent to normal saline infusion despite strict adherence to the guideline
protocol.

Introduction
Central pontine myelinolysis (CPM) is a rare condition arising from the myelinolysis of white
matter tracts in the pons, most commonly in response to iatrogenic hypertonic stress caused by
the rapid correction of hyponatremia [1]; however, the disorder has also infrequently arisen in
other clinical settings [2]. The classic clinical course is biphasic, with a patient developing the
complications of hyponatremia (e.g. seizures, encephalopathy) that subside quickly after
rectifying serum sodium levels only to degenerate two to eight days later [3]. Here, we present
an even more uncommon case where CPM occurred despite strict adherence to the guideline
protocol.
Case Presentation
A 50-year-old male with a known history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, and
alcohol abuse was brought into the emergency department (ED) in an obtunded state by
emergency medical services. En route to the hospital, he had an episode of a generalized tonic￾clonic seizure (GTCS), which subsided with the administration of intravenous (IV) midazolam.
Initial presentation to the ED revealed a patient with fluctuating consciousness and a Glasgow
Coma Scale (GCS) score of 11/15. Vitals included a temperature of 36.6 C, a blood pressure of
178/107 mm Hg, a heart rate of 92 beats per minute, oxygen saturation of 90%, and a
respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute. The physical examination was unremarkable while a
neurologic exam was limited due to sedation. Cough and gag reflexes were intact.
Initial laboratory investigations are presented in Table 1.

Considering a low serum osmolality of 231 mEq/L, a low random urine osmolality of 161
mOsm/kilogram of water, and a lack of prior medications that could be attributed to the
decreasing levels of serum sodium, his hypovolemic hyponatremia was attributed to
psychogenic polydipsia and/or poor oral solute intake. The patient was initially treated with an
infusion of two liters of normal saline (NS) and 200 mL of hypertonic saline. The serum sodium
rose to 112 mEq/L with this infusion in the first 24 hours. An appropriate rise in serum sodium
was observed in the ensuing four days, at a rate of 8 mEq per 24 hours. During the course of his
medical intensive care unit (MICU) stay, the patient remained somnolent and visibly
encephalopathic, which led to a self-extubation on the fifth day of his admission. He
maintained a near-normal oxygen saturation on room air and was, therefore, continued on
oxygen via a nasal cannula.
The patient’s altered mentation was initially attributed to multifactorial etiologies, which
included intensive care unit (ICU) delirium, acute hypoxic encephalopathy, and electrolyte
abnormalities. An appropriate sodium correction and a lack of hypoxic episodes prior to or after
self-extubation ruled out the differentials, explaining his altered mentation. Despite adequate
treatment, a persistent somnolence prompted a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
whose findings were consistent with osmotic pontine demyelination. Imaging revealed edema
and swelling in the pons, which was consistent with a subacute injury related to osmotic

demyelination. Edema involving the internal/external capsules, thalamus, and amygdala as
well as enhancement involving the subcortical white matter in the temporal lobes were also
observed and attributed to a likely related subacute osmotic injury (Figure 1).

The patient continued to have difficulty in efficiently managing his oral secretions secondary to
his neurological deficits and eventually aspirated with resultant findings of aspiration
pneumonia in the ICU setting. He was treated with ampicillin-sulbactam for the duration of
this predicament, five liters of oxygen via nasal cannula and frequent oral/pharyngeal suction.
A subsequent neurology and palliative care consult concluded that the best approach moving
forward was for the patient to undergo aggressive physical, occupational, and speech therapies
over the next eight weeks and to observe for signs of improvement. The patient is currently
followed in the outpatient department (OPD) with frequent follow-ups while further decisions
regarding goals of care will be made after the resolution of these intensive therapeutic
strategies.
Discussion
Osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS) is an acute neurological disorder caused by damage to
the myelin sheath of neurons [1]. Due to the greater susceptibility of the pons, the central
pontine myelinolysis (CPM) subtype is the classical presentation. CPM was initially described
in 1959 as a new disorder in a report of four patients who were chronic alcoholics and
malnourished [2]. Early authors concentrated on alcoholism and it was not until the late 1970s
that the connection with electrolyte abnormalities was established [3].

Although the precise pathogenesis remains unclear, the most frequent trigger of myelinolysis
in clinical practice is the rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia [2]. Osmotic demyelination
has also been observed in other settings in the absence of rapid serum correction, such as
hyperosmolar hyperglycemia, hyperammonemia, hypoxia, severe liver disease, and chronic
alcoholism [4]. It is postulated that the brain adapts to chronically low levels of the intracellular
osmolyte, and the subsequent iatrogenic hypertonic stress owing to rapid correction of
hyponatremia causes the ions and water to quickly re-enter the intracellular space. As this
occurs, the intracellular sodium and chloride levels rise to a higher than normal value, resulting
in cellular dehydration [5].
Recent guidelines from the United States suggest that correction rates for hyponatremia not
exceed 8 mEq/L for any 24-hour period in patients who carry a high risk for osmotic
demyelination (e.g., serum sodium <=105 mEq/L, hypokalemia, malnutrition, or liver disease).
European guidelines propose limiting correction to <=10 mEq/L in the first 24 hours and <=8
mEq/L for any 24-hour period thereafter [6]. However, there have been cases such as ours,
although rare, where CPM occurred despite the fact that guideline instructions were
implemented absolutely. The current standard method for the diagnosis of CPM is brain
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). T1-weighted images will show the symmetric hypointense
lesions; meanwhile, T2-weighted images have symmetric hyperintense lesions [7-8].
In literature, several treatment modalities, such as thyrotropin-releasing hormone,
plasmapheresis, steroids, and immunoglobulins have been proposed for CPM but due to a lack
of randomized controlled trials, they have not been included in the treatment guidelines. To
date, the most prominent approach to CPM is supportive management and preventing
secondary life-threatening complications [9].
The prognosis of CPM varies widely from almost complete recovery to partial or no recovery at
all. Although previously thought to be almost consistently fatal or severely debilitating, CPM is
actually compatible with good recovery in the majority of cases [2]. The prompt diagnosis of
CPM with MRI and the prompt initiation of treatment could explain this decline in overall
mortality [5]. Some of the favorable outcomes for CPM include in the presence of higher
Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores, better scores on functional scales used in hospitals at
admission, discharge and last follow-up, less severe hyponatremia, and absence of superadded
hypokalaemia [10].
Conclusions
Central pontine myelinolysis (CPM) is a neurological disorder infrequently encountered in the
clinical setting. Most commonly, it is precipitated by iatrogenic hypertonic stress from rapid
infusion, leading to the myelinolysis of white matter tracts in the pons. Although rare, patients
with a slow correction of hyponatremia may also develop CPM. Contrary to previously held
beliefs, patients with CPM often achieve favorable recovery but a paucity of randomized control
trials means that the treatment of CPM is restricted to providing supportive care and
preventing further complications.
