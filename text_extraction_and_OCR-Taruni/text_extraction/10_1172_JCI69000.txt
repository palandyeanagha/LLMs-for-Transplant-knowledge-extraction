Identification of single-gene causes of steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) has furthered the under￾standing of the pathogenesis of this disease. Here, using a combination of homozygosity mapping and whole 
human exome resequencing, we identified mutations in the aarF domain containing kinase 4 (ADCK4) gene 
in 15 individuals with SRNS from 8 unrelated families. ADCK4 was highly similar to ADCK3, which has been 
shown to participate in coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) biosynthesis. Mutations in ADCK4 resulted in reduced CoQ10
levels and reduced mitochondrial respiratory enzyme activity in cells isolated from individuals with SRNS 
and transformed lymphoblasts. Knockdown of adck4 in zebrafish and Drosophila recapitulated nephrotic 
syndrome-associated phenotypes. Furthermore, ADCK4 was expressed in glomerular podocytes and par￾tially localized to podocyte mitochondria and foot processes in rat kidneys and cultured human podocytes. 
In human podocytes, ADCK4 interacted with members of the CoQ10 biosynthesis pathway, including COQ6, 
which has been linked with SRNS and COQ7. Knockdown of ADCK4 in podocytes resulted in decreased 
migration, which was reversed by CoQ10 addition. Interestingly, a patient with SRNS with a homozygous 
ADCK4 frameshift mutation had partial remission following CoQ10 treatment. These data indicate that indi￾viduals with SRNS with mutations in ADCK4 or other genes that participate in CoQ10 biosynthesis may be 
treatable with CoQ10.
Introduction
Nephrotic syndrome (NS) is a chronic kidney disease that is 
defined by significant proteinuria (>40 mg/m2/h), with resulting 
hypoalbuminemia, which causes edema (1). NS constitutes the 
second most frequent cause of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD)

in children (2, 3). While most children with NS have steroid-sen￾sitive NS, approximately 10%–20% of children and 40% of adults 
with NS do not achieve sustained remission after glucocorticoid 
therapy and additional immunosuppressive therapy and enter into 
ESKD (1). These cases of steroid-resistant NS (SRNS) manifest his￾tologically as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) (4).
Recent discoveries of the single-gene causes of NS have signifi￾cantly increased our understanding of glomerular filtration bar￾rier physiology and of pathogenic mechanisms of NS (1). To date, 
more than 9 recessive genes that cause NS if mutated have been 
identified (5, 6). Overall, these genes account for up to approxi￾mately 66% of NS that starts within the first year of life (2). 
However, monogenic causes of a significant proportion of child￾hood- or adult-onset NS are still molecularly unsolved. Moreover, 
recently identified genes are very rare, being mutated in only one 
family out of hundreds (7). To overcome the limitations posed by 
the rarity of genes when identifying genes associated with NS, we 
established a strategy of combining homozygosity mapping (HM) 
with whole-exome resequencing (WER) (8, 9). Here, we applied this 
approach to sibling cases of childhood-onset NS and thereby iden￾tified mutations of aarF domain containing kinase 4 (ADCK4) as a 
single-gene cause of SRNS.
Results
Mutations in ADCK4 cause SRNS. To identify further single-gene 
causes of SRNS, we performed HM followed by WER in a group of 
individuals with histology that revealed FSGS (Figure 1, A and B). 
In a family (A2338) of Arab origin, 2 siblings had early-onset SRNS 
and renal histology that revealed glomerulosclerosis (Figure 1A). 
HM in both affected siblings yielded 5 regions of homozygosity 
by descent with a cumulative genomic length of approximately 
115 Mb, none of which coincided with any of 7 common recessive 
causes of SRNS (Figure 1C). The presence of homozygosity strong￾ly suggested a recessive causative gene, and the lack of overlap with 
known NS gene loci suggested that the gene to be identified in 
this family would be novel. By WER in one of the affected siblings 
from family A2338, we detected a homozygous missense mutation 
(c.532C>T;p.R178W) in ADCK4 (NM_024876.3) on chromosome 
19, encoding ADCK4. This variant was the only homozygous vari￾ant remaining from the variant filtering process (Supplemental 
Table 1; supplemental material available online with this article; 
doi:10.1172/JCI69000DS1). The mutation (p.R178W) alters 
an amino acid residue conserved throughout evolution from 
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. It segregated with the affected status in 
this family and was absent from >190 ethnically matched healthy 
control individuals and from >8,600 European controls in the 
Exome Variant Server (http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/).
WER in an addtional 6 different families with SRNS also yielded 
9 additional mutations in ADCK4 (3 families with homozygous 
mutations and 3 families with compound heterozygous muta￾tions) (Figure 1, D–G, and Table 1). WER of one affected individ￾ual in family 386 identified compound heterozygous mutations: 
c.101G>A;p.W34* and c.954_956dup;p.T319dup. We identified 
compound heterozygous mutations (c.645delT;p.F215Lfs*14 and 
c.4130G>A;p.R477Q in ADCK4) in 2 affected siblings from family 
231 from Algeria (Figure 1F and Table 1). The missense mutation 
(p.R477Q) altered an amino acid residue that was continually con￾served from C. reinhardtii to humans (Figure 1G). In a family (A5170) 
of 3 affected siblings, WER revealed compound heterozygous 
mutations: c.857A>G;p.D286G and c.1447G>T;p.E483* in ADCK4
(Figure 1F and Table 1). This missense mutation (p.D286G) altered 
an amino acid residue that is continually conserved from C. rein￾hardtii to humans (Figure 1G). One of the homozygous mutations 
(p.R320W) in ADCK4 was found in 2 affected siblings from the ABD 
family from Tunisia in an amino acid residue continually conserved 
throughout evolution from C. reinhardtii (Figure 1, F and G, and 
Table 1). In another family (Mek) from Morocco, we discovered a 
missense mutation c.1027C>T;p.R343W in this gene in 2 affected 
siblings (Figure 1F and Table 1). The amino acid residue R343 has 
been conserved from C. reinhardtii to humans (Figure 1G). The other 
homozygous mutation was an out-of-frame deletion of 7 bases 
(p.Q452Hfs) in exon 15 of ADCK4 in 2 affected siblings from a 
family from India, with renal histology showing collapsing FSGS 
(cFSGS) (Figure 1F and Table 1).
To discover additional mutations in ADCK4, we then performed 
multiplex barcoded array-based PCR amplification and next-gen￾eration sequencing in an additional 400 individuals with SRNS 
(10). In an individual with SRNS (A4169-21), we detected a homo￾zygous insertion of an “A” (H400Nfs*11) in exon 13 of ADCK4
(Figure 1F and Table 1). Sequences of primers used to amplify 
exons and exon-intron boundaries of ADCK4 are listed in Supple￾mental Table 2. All 15 affected individuals of the 8 families with 
recessive mutations in ADCK4 had SRNS. Renal biopsy revealed 
FSGS in most cases. Interestingly, in 3 affected individuals (1146, 
Pt5497, and Pt5497), renal histology showed cFSGS (Figure 1B 
and Table 1). Moreover, the individual A4169-21, who has a homo￾zygous truncating allele, showed the earliest onset of SRNS and 
also presented with developmental delay (Table 1).
ADCK4 spans 12 kb on chromosome 19q13.1. Up to 17 differ￾ent putative alternatively spliced ADCK4 transcripts encoding dif￾ferent proteins have been proposed (AceView; http://www.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/ieb/research/acembly/index.html). The longest tran￾script of ADCK4 (NM_024876.3) has 14 coding exons (Figure 1D) 
and encodes a 60.1-kDa protein (NP_079152.3, isoform a, 544

amino acids) (Figure 1E). Analysis of the ADCK4 amino acid 
sequence yielded a helical domain and an ABC1 domain and a 
kinase domain (Figure 1E). ADCK4 has high sequence similar￾ity to Abc1/Coq8 and is evolutionarily conserved to Ciona intes￾tinalis (sea squirt) (XP_002126787.1), Drosophila melanogaster
(NP_572836.1), Caenorhabditis elegans (NP_498014.2), C. reinhardtii
(XP_001702520.1), and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (NP_011396.1), 
suggesting a conserved function of the domain assembly.
Knockdown of adck4 in animal models recapitulates the nephrosis phe￾notype. To further validate the causative role of ADCK4 for the 
SRNS phenotype, we performed knockdown of the ADCK4 ortho￾log in zebrafish. For zebrafish gene knockdown experiments, we 
used a p53 morpholino oligonucleotide (MO) as a negative con￾trol to minimize nonspecific apoptotic MO effects (11). p53 MO 
injection into fertilized zebrafish eggs at the 1- to 4-cell stage did 
not produce any phenotype through 168 hours postfertilization 
(hpf) (Figure 2A). However, coinjection of the p53 control MO 
with an MO targeting the translation initiation site of zebrafish 
adck4 caused the nephrosis phenotype of periorbital and total 
body edema, reminiscent of signs of NS in humans, in 54.1% of 
embryos at 120 hpf (Figure 2B). Similar results were obtained 
with 2 MOs targeting the splice donor site (e2i2 MO and e3i3 
MO) (Figure 2C; Supplemental Figure 1, A–D; and Supplemental 
Table 3). The summary of edema phenotype observed in adck4
morphants is displayed in Supplemental Figure 1E. The protein￾uric effect of the adck4 MO was confirmed using an established 
zebrafish proteinuria assay (12) by ELISA against a fusion protein 
of vitamin D–binding protein and GFP in l-fabp::VDBP-GFP trans￾genic zebrafish (Figure 2D). We then performed transmission 
electron microscopy imaging of zebrafish to permit a more direct 
evaluation of glomerular structures of morphants. When com￾pared with the control (Figure 2E), we observed upon knockdown 
of adck4 characteristic alterations of nephrosis (Figure 2E). These 
included podocyte foot process effacement and disorganization, 
rarefaction of slit membranes, and disorganization of the glo￾merular basement membranes in zebrafish glomeruli (Figure 2E, 
black arrowheads in right panel), as previously described in plce1
knockdown (13).
In addition, we performed knockdown of Drosophila coq8 (dcoq8) 
in Drosophila pericardial nephrocytes, which share remarkable 
similarities to the glomerular podocytes (14). The protein uptake 
assay showed that knockdown of dcoq8 in nephrocytes reduced 
the uptake ability of a secreted fusion protein of rat atrial natri￾uretic factor (ANF) and GFP, suggesting that dcoq8 is required for 
nephrocyte function in Drosophila (Supplemental Figure 2, A and 
B). The amino acid of dCoq8 has 53% sequence identity to both 
ADCK3 and ADCK4 Drosophila (Supplemental Figure 2C).
ADCK4 localizes to the mitochondria and foot processes in podocytes. Since 
most gene products that are defective in SRNS are located in glomeru￾lar podocytes, we examined the subcellular localization of ADCK4 in 
adult rat kidney by immunofluorescence (IF). Podocytes, as identi￾fied by expression of nuclear WT1, expressed ADCK4 at high levels 
in cell bodies and primary processes (Figure 3A). ADCK4 also par￾tially colocalized with cytochrome oxidase subunit VI (COXIV) and 
mitochondrially encoded cytochrome c oxidase 1 (MTCO1), 2 known 
mitochondrial marker proteins, suggesting that ADCK4 partly local￾izes to the mitochondria in renal glomeruli (Figure 3, B and C). In 
addition, ADCK4 is detected in proximal tubules and collecting ducts 
(Supplemental Figure 3, A and B). To further investigate the localiza￾tion of ADCK4, we performed immunogold electron microscopy in 
adult rat kidneys. In podocytes, ADCK4 was predominantly detected 
at foot processes (Figure 3D). The specificity of the anti-ADCK4 anti￾body used in the IF and immunogold electron microscopy studies 
is demonstrated in Supplemental Figure 4. We also examined the

expression of ADCK4 in cultured podocytes by IF. The overexpressed 
ADCK4–red fluorescent protein (ADCK4-RFP) partially colocalized 
to mitochondria, and we also noticed that ADCK4-RFP localized to 
ruffles (Figure 3E) of podocytes, the equivalents of foot processes 
(Figure 3E and Supplemental Figure 3, C and D). Consistent with data 
from the cellular fractionation of cultured podocytes, these findings 
showed that ADCK4 is endogenously present in both the cytosolic 
and mitochondrial fractions (Figure 3F). Thus, in addition to its role 
in the mitochondrial respiratory chain, ADCK4 seems to have a very 
localized function at ruffles and foot processes of podocytes.
ADCK4 is enriched in podocytes and interacts with COQ6 and COQ7. 
By quantitative real-time PCR, we showed that, although ADCK3 
expression exceeds that of ADCK4 in most human tissues (Supple￾mental Figure 5), ADCK4 is enriched in both differentiated and 
undifferentiated human podocytes (Figure 4A).
Furthermore, we performed coimmunoprecipita￾tion studies in cultured podocytes to examine whether 
ADCK4 interacts with other proteins like COQ6 and 
COQ7 that are involved in the coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) 
biosynthesis pathway. COQ6 was overexpressed in 
podocytes, and coimmunoprecipitation was performed. 
Interestingly, the protein complex precipitated by COQ6 
included COQ7 and ADCK4 (Figure 4B). We also con￾firmed that ADCK4 and COQ6 interact endogenously in 
lysates from differentiated podocytes (Figure 4C).
Levels of CoQ10 are decreased in individuals with ADCK4 
mutations. To investigate whether the defect in ADCK4
has any effect on CoQ10 biosynthesis, we measured the 
total CoQ10 contents in EBV-transformed lymphoblasts 
or cultured skin fibroblasts derived from individuals 
from the A2338, A4169, and Pt5496/Pt5497 families, 
in which ADCK4 mutations were detected. In the case 
of the A2338 and A4169 families, the total CoQ10 was 
found to be strongly reduced in the affected siblings, 
A2338-21 (81.92 ± 18.45 pmol/mg protein) and A2338-22 
(75.99 ± 34.60 pmol/mg protein), who have a homozy￾gous missense mutation (p.R178W), and in an affected individual, 
A4169-21 (59.12 ± 9.57 pmol/mg protein), who has a homozygous 
frameshift mutation (p.H400Nfs*11) (Figure 5A). In contrast, the 
unaffected individuals, A2338-26 and A2338-27, who have both 
wild-type alleles, had 784.40 ± 164.10 and 758.00 ± 286.60 pmol/mg 
protein of total CoQ10, respectively (Figure 5A).
Likewise, in the case of Pt5496 and Pt5497, we confirmed similar 
results and found that the total CoQ10 was reduced in fibroblasts 
(20.11 ± 3.41 pmol/mg protein for #50552 and 19.75 ± 4.63 pmol/mg 
protein for #50553) from these individuals, who have a homozy￾gous frameshift mutation (p.Q452Hfs), and normal in fibroblasts 
(64.33 ± 11.92 pmol/mg protein for #50551 and 83.04 ± 20.64 pmol/mg 
protein for #50550) from the unaffected parents (Figure 5B).
In addition, we examined mitochondrial respiratory enzyme 
activity in fibroblasts by measuring maximal uncoupled oxygen

consumption rate (OCR), which shows the CoQ10 transfer of elec￾trons from mitochondrial complex I and complex II to complex III. 
Maximal OCR was significantly reduced in fibroblasts from 
Pt5496 and Pt5497 compared with that in fibroblasts from con￾trols or their healthy parents (Figure 5C).
Loss of ADCK4 does not induce proliferation or apoptosis in fibroblasts or 
cultured podocytes. We had previously reported that knockdown of 
COQ6 can cause apoptosis in podocytes (7). Since ADCK4 inter￾acts with COQ6, we investigated the effect of loss of ADCK4 on cell 
proliferation and apoptosis in fibroblasts from individuals with a 
homozygous frameshift ADCK4 mutation (Pt5496 and Pt5497) and 
their healthy parents as well as in cultured podocytes. We found that 
fibroblasts (#50552 and #50553) from affected individuals did not 
show any difference in cell proliferation or apoptosis induced by 
hydrogen peroxide compared to parental fibroblasts (#50550 and 
#50551) (Supplemental Figure 6, A and B). Furthermore, in contrast 
to COQ6, knockdown of ADCK4 in podocytes did not affect prolif￾eration or apoptosis (Supplemental Figure 6, C and D).
ADCK4 knockdown reduces podocyte migration, which is reversed 
by the addition of CoQ10. We next examined the effect of ADCK4 
knockdown on podocyte migration using the xCELLigence sys￾tem, which monitors cell migration in real-time (Figure 6). We 
found that migration of podocytes was reduced by knockdown 
of ADCK4 (Figure 6A). Because CoQ10 treatment had resulted in 
improvement of the NS phenotype in an individual with a muta￾tion in ADCK4, we tested the effect of the addition of CoQ10 on 
podocyte migration. Interestingly, we found that the addition 
of CoQ10 reversed the decreased migratory phenotype caused 
by ADCK4 knockdown (Figure 6, A and B). Similar results were 
obtained when 2 additional siRNAs were used for knockdown of 
ADCK4 in cultured human podocytes (ADCK4 siRNAs #5 and #6) 
(Figure 6, C and D). We further found that decreased migration, 
which was caused by an ADCK4 siRNA (ADCK4 siRNA #6), was 
reversed when wild-type mouse ADCK4 was transfected into podo￾cytes (Figure 6C). This result also confirmed that the effect on 
podocyte migration was caused by ADCK4 loss of function.
Discussion
Here, we describe the discovery of mutations in ADCK4 as causes 
of SRNS. We have shown that ADCK4 is expressed in podocytes 
and localizes to mitochondria and foot processes and interacts 
with COQ6 endogenously. Knockdown of ADCK4 in podocytes 
reduced their migration phenotype, which could be reversed by 
overexpression of siRNA-resistant ADCK4 or, most importantly, 
by the addition of CoQ10. By knockdown of adck4 in zebrafish, we 
clearly demonstrated that the function of this gene is necessary to 
avoid the NS disease phenotype. The fact that ADCK4 has high 
sequence similarity with ADCK3, which was previously reported 
to be associated with CoQ10 deficiency (15), and the fact that cells 
from affected individuals with ADCK4 mutations (families A2338, 
A4169, and Pt5496/Pt5497) had reduced total CoQ10 content sug￾gests that ADCK4 is also involved in CoQ10 biosynthesis.
CoQ10, also known as ubiquinone, is a lipid-soluble compo￾nent of virtually all cell membranes, in which it is thought to 
play an important antioxidant role as well as to transport elec￾trons from complexes I and II to complex III in the respiratory 
chain of the mitochondrial inner membrane (16). The biochemi￾cal pathway of CoQ10 biosynthesis is complex and has not been 
completely elucidated. Primary CoQ10 deficiencies due to muta￾tions in ubiquinone biosynthetic genes (COQ2, COQ4, COQ6, 
PDSS1, PDSS2, and ADCK3) have been identified (7, 15, 17–26). 
Clinical manifestations of CoQ10 deficiency are variable. For 
example, individuals with COQ2 mutations present with pheno￾types ranging from isolated NS to catastrophic neonatal multi￾system disorder with encephalomyopathy and renal involvement 
to a recently described multiple-system atrophy (20, 23–27). In

Coimmunoprecipitation was performed using an anti-V5 antibody and then blotting was performed with antibodies for ADCK4, COQ6, and COQ7. 
Note that the protein complex precipitated by COQ6 includes COQ7 and ADCK4. (C) Interaction of endogenous ADCK4 and COQ6 in differenti￾ated podocytes. Podocyte lysates were precipitated with an anti-ADCK4 antibody or a control rabbit IgG. The precipitated proteins were separated 
by SDS-PAGE and blotted with an anti-COQ6 antibody.

addition, COQ6 (7) and PDSS2 (19) have also been implicated in 
the cause of SRNS.
We as well as Montini et al. have shown previously that the indi￾viduals affected with SRNS due to mutations in CoQ10 biosyn￾thesis pathway genes like COQ2 and COQ6 can be treated with the 
innocuous food supplement CoQ10 (7, 28). CoQ10 deficiency in 
individuals with ADCK4 mutations thus raises the possibility of 
supplementation therapy. So far, only one individual (A4169-21) 
with ADCK4 mutation has been treated with CoQ10 (15 mg/kg/d) 
for over 4 years. He was first treated with intravenous methylpred￾nisolone followed by 2 mg/kg/d prednisolone over 10 weeks with￾out achieving remission of NS. Subsequently, he was treated with 
2 mg/kg/d cyclophosphamide for 3 months. The treatment result￾ed in partial remission, but treatment had to be stopped because 
of infections. Treatment with CoQ10 was commenced at 1 year of 
age, giving 100 mg/d CoQ10 orally together with 5 mg of pred￾nisolone every other day. Then, the edema disappeared and pro￾teinuria decreased significantly. The individual is currently being 
treated with CoQ10 (15 mg/kg/d) with captopril (12.5 mg/d). Even 
though the effectiveness of CoQ10 treatment cannot be generalized 
for individuals with ADCK4 mutations at the moment based on 
this single case, we still think that the identification of molecular 
defects of CoQ10 biosynthesis is important because they may repre￾sent forms of SRNS that are treatable by administration of CoQ10.
ADCK3 and ADCK4 are highly similar members of an ancient 
atypical kinase family and appear to result from gene duplication 
in vertebrates (15). The yeast Coq8/Abc1 is required for CoQ bio￾synthesis (29) and is essential for the organization of high-molec￾ular-mass Coq polypeptide complex and for phosphorylated forms 
of the Coq3, Coq5, and Coq7 polypeptides that perform methyla￾tion and hydroxylation steps in CoQ biosynthesis (30, 31). Con￾sidering their similarity, it is interesting that mutations in ADCK3
result in cerebellar ataxia and seizures without renal involvement 
(15, 21), whereas mutations in ADCK4 cause SRNS mostly without 
neurological symptoms. Currently, there is no clear explanation 
for this; however, this may be partially due to their differential 
tissue expression (Figure 4A and Supplemental Figure 5). Xie et 
al. previously showed that ADCK3 can rescue yeast coq8 mutants 
and restore phosphorylated forms of yeast Coq polypeptides (30), 
but the same group observed that expression of ADCK4 failed to 
rescue coq8 mutants (data not shown). On the other hand, knock￾down of Dcoq8, which has 53% amino acid identity to both ADCK3 
and ADCK4, caused defects in nephrocyte function (Supplemental 
Figure 2). Overall, these results suggest that ADCK3 and ADCK4 
are independently required for synthesis of CoQ, yet retain distinct 
functions, a difference that may have evolved in vertebrates, and 
that ADCK3 may be closer to yeast Coq8.
cFSGS is defined morphologically by the presence of hyper￾plastic and hypertropic podocytes overlying collapsed capillary 
loops within glomerular tufts (32). Interestingly, the histology 
of affected individuals (1146, Pt5496, and Pt5497) with ADCK4
mutations showed cFSGS. In addition, mutant kd/kd mice, 
which have a missense mutation in Pdss2 and present with iso￾lated nephropathy, have features of cFSGS (33). Therefore, it will 
be important to investigate whether nephropathy resulting from 
CoQ10 deficiency results in cFSGS, because this may be a phe￾notypic criterion with which to choose individuals with SRNS 
that should be screened for genes involved in CoQ10 biosynthesis, 
such as COQ2, COQ6, PDSS2, and ADCK4. To answer this, it is 
necessary to investigate more SRNS cases resulting from CoQ10
deficiency. In addition, knockout animal models for Coq2, Coq6, 
and Adck4 will be helpful.

In conclusion, we identified recessive mutations in ADCK4 as 
novel single-gene causes of SRNS. Early recognition of this new 
genetic entity of SRNS will be important because it may repre￾sent a form of SRNS that can potentially be treated by CoQ10
supplementation.
Methods
Subjects. Following informed consent, we obtained clinical data and blood 
samples from individuals with SRNS or steroid-sensitive NS from world￾wide sources. The diagnosis of NS was made by (pediatric) nephrologists 
based on standardized clinical and renal histological criteria (34). Renal 
biopsies were evaluated by renal pathologists. Clinical data were obtained 
using a standardized questionnaire (http://www.renalgenes.org).
HM, WER, and mutation calling. For the A2338 family, HM, WER, and 
mutation calling were performed as described previously (35). HM in 
the 231 and ABD families was performed using Human Mapping 250k 
NspI Array (Affymetrix), and parametric logarithm of odds (LOD) scores 
were calculated with MERLIN (36). For WER of the 231, ABD, and Mek 
families, DNA was processed using All Exon 50Mb V3 (Agilent SureSelect) 
to enrich for exonic sequences and a SOLiD 5500XL high-throughput 
sequencing machine (Applied Biosystems) (paired-end reads: 50 bases for￾ward, 25 bases reverse). Obtained sequences were aligned to the human 
genome (NCBI build 37/hg19) using Lifescope suite from Lifetech. Sub￾stitution and variation calls were made with the GATK pipeline (mpileup, 
bfctools, vcfuitil). Variants were then annotated with an in-house software 
(Polyweb), which allows users to set up bioinformatic filters in order to 
identify the putative mutation.
Plasmids, cell culture, and transfection. A human ADCK4 clone was purchased 
from Open Biosystems (clone accession BC013114.1). The mutant clones of 
ADCK4 were generated by a PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis method. 
The COQ6 clones were described previously (7). The immortalized human 
podocytes (37) were maintained in RPMI plus GlutaMAX-I (Gibco) sup￾plemented with 10% FBS, penicillin (50 IU/ml)/streptomycin (50 μg/ml), 
and Insulin-Transferrin-Selenium-X (Invitrogen). Plasmids and siRNA 
were transfected into podocytes using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). 
The ADCK4-specific and control scrambled siRNAs were purchased from 
Dharmacon or Sigma-Aldrich. Lymphoblasts were purified from blood 
samples using Ficoll-Paque PLUS (GE Healthcare) according to the manu￾facturer’s instructions. The isolated lymphoblasts were transformed by 
EBV and immortalized as described previously (38). Human fibroblasts 
were grown in DMEM supplemented with 15% FBS, penicillin (50 IU/ml)/
streptomycin (50 μg/ml), and nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen).
Immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation, and IF staining. These experiments were 
performed as described previously (13). Anti-ADCK4 (LSBio), anti-MTCO1 
(Abcam), anti-COXIV (Abcam), anti-COQ6 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.), 
anti-COQ7 (Proteintech), and anti-V5 (Invitrogen) were used. Fluorescent 
images were obtained with a Leica SP5X laser scanning microscope.
Immunogold electron microscopy. Rat renal cortex samples were dissected 
and trimmed into 1-mm-thick blocks, which were fixed by immersion in 4% 
formaldehyde and 0.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, 
and processed for embedment in LR White. Semithin sections (700 nm) 
were first obtained to locate areas that contained glomeruli. Subsequently, 
ultrathin sections (70 nm) were obtained from those areas and collected 
on formvar-coated nickel grids and etched with saturated sodium peri￾odate for 15 minutes. Sections were blocked with 0.1 M phosphate buf￾fer, pH 7.4, containing 1% BSA, 3% goat serum, and 0.05% Tween-20 for 
1 hour at room temperature and incubated with a rabbit anti-ADCK4 anti￾body (LSBio) in buffer overnight at 4°C. Sections were then washed and 
incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to 18 nm gold (Jackson 
ImmunoResearch Laboratories) and stained with uranyl acetate. Sections 
in which the primary antibody was omitted during the overnight incuba￾tion were used as negative control. Sections were observed on a Zeiss 910 
transmission electron microscope.
Mitochondrial fractionation. The mitochondrial fractionation of podo￾cytes was done using Mitochondrial Isolation Kit for Cultured Cells 
(Thermo Scientific), Mitochondrial/Cytosol Fractionation Kit (Abcam), 
and Mitochondrial Fractionation Kit (Active Motif) according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions.

Knockdown of ADCK4 decreases the migratory 
phenotype of podocytes. (A) The effect of ADCK4 
knockdown on podocyte migration. Podocytes trans￾fected with ADCK4 siRNA (red) exhibited decreased 
migration compared with podocytes transfected with 
scrambled siRNA (black). The decrease in podocyte 
migration was partially reversed by the addition of 
50 μM CoQ10 (green). Error bars are shown in only 
one direction for clarity and indicate SDs from 3 inde￾pendent experiments. (B) The efficiency of ADCK4
siRNA used in A was confirmed by immunoblotting 
with an anti-ADCK4 antibody and an anti–β-actin 
antibody. (C) Transfection of podocytes with 2 addi￾tional ADCK4-specific siRNAs (siRNA #5 and #6) 
confirmed the result from A that ADCK4 knockdown 
in human podocytes reduces migration (red dotted 
and solid lines) compared with podocytes transfect￾ed with the scrambled siRNA (black). The decrease 
in podocyte migration by ADCK4 knockdown using 
ADCK4 siRNA #6 was rescued by transfection of 
mouse Adck4 construct (green). Mouse ADCK4 has 
5 mismatches from the siRNA target sequences. 
Error bars indicate SDs of 3 independent experi￾ments. (D) The efficiency of ADCK4 siRNAs used in 
C was confirmed by immunoblotting. 100 nM of each 
siRNA was transfected into podocytes.

and UAS-RNAi transgenes (14, 41). Nephrocyte function was measured by 
the amount of secreted red fluorescent proteins accumulated in nephro￾cytes at the second instar larvae stage (14, 41). Hand-GFP (42) was used to 
label the cardiac nephrocytes.
Statistics. Results are presented as mean ± SEM or SD for the number of 
experiments indicated in the figure legends. Statistical analysis of con￾tinuous data was performed with 2-tailed Student’s t test or multiple com￾parison, as appropriate. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Study approval. Approval for research in human subjects was obtained 
from the IRBs of the University of Michigan, Boston Children’s Hospital, 
Université Paris Descartes, University of Toronto, Yale University, and Beth 
Israel Deaconess Medical Center.

Podocyte migration and proliferation assay. Real-time migration assays 
were performed using the xCELLIgence system (ACEA Biosciences) 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For migration assays, 
24 hours after transfection, 4 × 104 cells were plated with serum-free 
media in the upper chamber of the CIM-plate 16 (ACEA Biosciences). 
The lower chambers were filled with 10% FBS for chemoattraction or 
with serum-free media. For proliferation assays, 4 × 104 cells were plated 
with serum-free media in the E-plate 16 (ACEA Biosciences). The data 
obtained were analyzed with RTCA software. Results are presented as 
the time versus cell index curve.
Zebrafish studies. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) were maintained and reared as 
described previously (12). Approval for zebrafish research was obtained 
from the University of Michigan and the Boston Children’s Hospital 
Committees on the Use and Care of Animals. MOs were injected into the 
AB* wild-type strain for phenotype analysis of morphants and transmis￾sion electron microscopy. The proteinuria assays were performed using 
l-fabp::VDBP-GFP transgenic fish and the GFP ELISA Kit (Cell Biolabs) as 
described previously (12).
CoQ10 measurements. Cells (approximately 0.1 g) were thawed on ice and 
resuspended in 1.5 ml phosphate-buffered saline (0.14 M NaCl, 12.0 mM 
NaH2PO4, 8.1 mM Na2HPO4, pH 7.4), followed by homogenization with 
a polytron (Kinematica PT 2500E) for 1 minute at 15,300 g on ice. Lipid 
extracts were prepared by addition of 1.2 ml methanol, followed by 1.8 ml 
petroleum ether. Diethoxy-CoQ10 served as an internal standard (39). A typ￾ical standard curve contains 5 standards with 7.2 pmol, 20 pmol, 72 pmol, 
140 pmol, and 400 pmol of CoQ10, respectively. Standard curve samples 
and experimental samples shared identical extractions. Each of the extrac￾tion tubes were vortexed for 45 seconds. The upper layer was removed, 
and the lower aqueous phase was reextracted with 1.8 ml petroleum ether. 
Nitrogen gas dried the combined organic phase, and 200 μl ethanol dis￾solved the dried lipids (USP, Apaer Alcohol and Chemical Co.). A binary 
HPLC solvent delivery system with a Luna Phenyl-Hexyl column (particle 
size 3 μm, 50 × 2.00 mm; Phenomenex) coupled with an Applied Biosys￾tems 4000 QTRAP linear MS/MS spectrometer determined the total CoQ10
content. The mobile phase consisted of solvent A (methanol/isopropanol, 
95:5, with 2.5 mM ammonium formate) and solvent B (isopropanol, with 
2.5 mM ammonium formate). The percentage of solvent B started at 0% 
for the first 1.5 minutes, increased linearly to 15% by 2 minutes, remained 
constant for the next 1 minute, and decreased linearly back to 0% by 
4 minutes. The flow rate remained constant at 600 μl/min. Data acqui￾sition and processing required Analyst software (version 1.4.2). Multiple￾reaction monitoring mode detected quinone content, with the following 
transitions: mass-to-charge [m/z] ratio 880.7:197.0 (CoQ10 with ammo￾nium adduct); m/z 882.7:197.0 (Q10H2 with ammonium adduct); m/z
908.7:225.1 (diethoxy-Q10 with ammonium adduct), and m/z 910.7:225.1 
(diethoxy-Q10H2 with ammonium adduct).
Mitochondrial respiratory enzyme activity measurement. Fibroblasts derived 
from controls (NHDF-neo, Bio-Rad), healthy parents, or 2 affected indi￾viduals (Pt5496 and Pt5497) were seeded at 20,000 cells per well in 80 ml 
DMEM and incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 24 hours. In vivo maximal 
uncoupled OCR over the whole respiratory chain, including the CoQ10
transfer of electrons from mitochondrial complex I and complex II to 
complex III, was measured using the XF96 Extracellular Flux Analyzer 
(Seahorse Bioscience) (40). Mitochondria membrane potential was uncou￾pled by the addition of carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy) phenylhy￾drazone (FCCP, 0.4 μM). Nonmitochondrial respiration was determined 
after the addition of 2.5 μM rotenone/5 μM antimycin A.
RNAi-based Drosophila nephrocyte functional assay. The MHC-ANF-RFP 
transgenic flies were generated in previous studies (14, 41). Nephrocyte￾specific gene knockdown was achieved by using nephrocyte-specific Gal4
