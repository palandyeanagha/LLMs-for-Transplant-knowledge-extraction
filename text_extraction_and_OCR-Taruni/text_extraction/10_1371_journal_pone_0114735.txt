Abstract
Background: Graft-versus-host Disease (GvHD) prophylaxis after allogeneic
hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) is an ongoing effort but relative
effects of different policies are not systematically explored.
Methods: We systematically reviewed 30-year evidence on GvHD prophylaxis and
quantified the relative effect of different policies using a network meta-analysis. We
searched PubMed and the Cochrane Library for randomized studies on the topic.
The primary outcome of interest was grade II-IV acute GvHD over 0 or I (with odds
ratio OR ,1 denoting benefit).
Findings: Thirty-three eligible studies that enrolled 3,440 patients (published up to
June 2014), provided data on seven immunosuppressive drugs namely cyclosporin
A (CsA), methotrexate (MTX), anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG), mycophenolate
mofetil (MMF), tacrolimus, sirolimus or corticosteroids and their combinations to
calculate 14 direct and 21 indirect effects. The majority of trials (32/33) referred to
myeloablative conditioning and sibling transplants (25/33). Tacrolimus/MTX (OR
0.44; 95% 0.27–0.70, number needed to treat to benefit, i.e. to avert a case of II-IV
GvHD, NNTB55) and ATG/CsA/MTX (OR 0.45; 95%CI 0.26–0.78; NNTB55) were
superior over CsA/MTX. ATG/CsA/MTX did not differ from tacrolimus/MTX (indirect
evidence). Sirolimus-based prophylaxis outperformed CsA/MTX (OR 0.10; 95%CI
0.02–0.49, NNTB54) and marginally outperformed tacrolimus/MTX (OR 0.22;
95%CI 0.05–1.11). Add-on corticosteroids had no benefit over CsA/MTX.
Conclusions: Tacrolimus/MTX and ATG/CsA/MTX were the outperformers over
CsA/MTX, but sirolimus-based regimens showed also potential. More randomized
data are needed for reduced-intensity conditioning, as well as for MMF and
sirolimus-containing regimens.

Introduction
The progress in the field of hematopoietic stem transplantation (HSCT) has
resulted in a substantial rise in eligible patients and expanded therapeutic
indications of HSCT. In 2010 only, over 12,000 patients received allogeneic
transplant across Europe and approximately 7,000 in the US, figures reported by
the European Group of Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) [1] and the
Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) [2],
respectively. Despite the documented progress, graft versus host disease (GvHD)
still remains an important constraint in allogeneic HSCT that partially hampers
ongoing efforts to expand the pool of eligible candidates. Acute GvHD correlates
inversely with both overall survival and treatment related mortality, and II-IV
grade represents a clear cut-off in prognosis [3, 4].
Morbidity remains high, treatment is difficult and prevention strategies are far
away from being considered optimal [5]. It was not until recently that the
European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation and the European
LeukemiaNet working group (EBMT-ELN) have published pertinent recom￾mendations for GvHD, aiming to standardize prevention and treatment policies
[5]. Optimization of prevention for GvHD remains an ongoing effort, as
retrospective data analysis – even for data derived from randomized studies –
suffers from substantial clinical heterogeneity between studies and inconsistencies
of assigned pharmacologic interventions. In that context, we systematically
reviewed pertinent randomized data, in order to summarize the relative effects of
assigned protocols on GvHD prophylaxis using a network meta-analysis of direct
and indirect comparisons.
Methods
We searched PubMed and The Cochrane Library databases for pertinent
randomized trials. Last access was on June 13, 2014. The search terms were:
‘‘(GvHD OR graft versus host) AND (randomized OR randomised)’’. We further
scrutinized bibliography of eligible articles for additional studies on the topic. We
complemented our search to include the American Society of Hematology (2004-
2013) and the European Hematology Association (2006-2014) proceedings for
additional randomized trials on the topic. Language restriction was not imposed.
We followed the PRISMA guidelines (S1 Checklist in S1 Appendix).
A randomized trial on HSCT was deemed eligible provided that it met all the
following conditions: (1) it randomized prophylactic schemes for GvHD, (2)
reported acute GvHD as an outcome of interest, and, (3) randomized
immunosuppressive drugs or drug combinations that are included in the recent
EBMT-ELN working group consensus for a standardized practice in HSCT [5]. A
trial was excluded from analysis if it had no extractable data on acute GvHD after
prophylaxis, compared different dosing or formulations of the same pharmaco￾logic agent, or used post hoc or historical arms for comparison. In case of follow￾up, extension or overlapping studies, only the first published article was included.

Studies outside the prophylactic setting, such as upfront or salvage therapies for
acute GvHD were not considered.
Three reviewers (PDZ, IMZ and FNZ) screened titles and abstracts for relevance
to the topic. All potentially relevant publications were independently evaluated in
full text by the same authors. The following information was sought: first author,
publication year, country of origin, sample size, median age, underlying
condition, donor type, setting (myeloablative or reduced-intensity conditioning,
RIC), conditioning regimens, total body irradiation, GvHD prophylaxis
stratification and risk of acute GvHD. The primary outcome of interest was acute
GvHD to day +100, dichotomized as II-IV grade over 0-I grading. We chose II-IV
over 0-I because this stratification represents a clear-cut off in prognosis [3, 4] and
the clinical cut-off to initiate GvHD treatment [5]. For completeness of the
analysis we added III-IV as a secondary outcome.
The quality of individual studies was graded using the Cochrane
Collaboration’s tool for assessing the risk of bias, with the use of 5 pertinent items:
random sequence generation and allocation concealment (for selection bias),
blinding of participants and personnel (for performance bias), incomplete
outcome (attrition bias), and selective reporting (for selection bias) [6].
The evidence synthesis is a network of comparisons, consisting of (a) pairwise
direct effects of the prophylactic regimens, and, (b) indirect effects between two
treatments against a common comparator [7]. For direct comparisons, the
random-effects pooled Odds Ratio (OR), according to DerSimonian and Laird,
was calculated and 95% precision estimates were reported [8]. We quantified
statistical heterogeneity using the Cochran’s Q test and I2 metric [9]. Evidence for
small study effects was sought using the Harbord-Egger test [10].
We applied the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and
Evaluation (GRADE) classification criteria (accessible at: http://www.
gradeworkinggroup.org/publications/JCE_series.htm) as previously described
[11], to validate the quality of evidence regarding the risk of acute GvHD. The
GRADE rating aims to explore the magnitude of confidence we have regarding
our effect estimations, ranking them in descending order as high, moderate, low
and very low [12]. In this context, when evidence is deemed as ‘‘high’’ quality, the
authors are very confident that the estimates represent the true effect, as opposed
to ‘‘very low’’ which implies that the true effect may actually differ from our
estimates. The effects derived from randomized trials are initially ranked as ‘‘high’’
but may be downgraded in the presence of up to five limitations, namely the risk
of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision and publication bias [13]. When
treatments were not compared directly, effects were calculated using an indirect
approach. Two competing strategies, A and B, are indirectly compared using the
equation ln(ORAB)5ln(ORAC)2ln(ORBC), where C is an intermediate strategy
with which both A and B are directly compared (the common comparator) [14–
16]. The corresponding 95% CIs are computed assuming asymptotic normality
and lack of covariance as described previously [14–17] Also, we reported the
number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) i.e. to avert a case of II-IV GvHD, and
number needed to treat to harm (NNTH) i.e. to develop II-IV GvHD [18, 19].

Stata v13 (College Station, TX, USA) was used for data analysis and graphs of
direct comparisons.
Results
Initial search yielded 769 citations from PubMed and 694 citations from the
Cochrane Library. After title and abstract screening of 1,028 non-duplicate
publications, 975 were excluded on the basis of relevance and a total of 53 articles
were retrieved for full-text evaluation. Twenty one were not deemed eligible
because they presented extension/overlapping data (n512), randomized drugs not
advocated by the EBMT-ELN working group (n54) [5], or evaluated different
dose/schedule of the same drug (n54). Also, one study was a matched-pair
analysis (not truly randomized). No additional studies were found from
conference proceedings.
Thirty two articles [20–51] remained eligible for final analysis on acute GvHD
prevention, providing data 3,440 patients from 33 randomized studies (S1 Flow￾Chart in S1 Appendix). The majority of studies (25/33, 76%) referred to sibling
donors and myeloablative setting (32/33, 97%). Four studies (12%) presented
data on both unrelated and sibling donors, and 4 studies (12%) on unrelated
donors solely. Of note is that one study had 40% of patients receiving RIC and no
study had randomized solely RIC transplants [25]. Bone marrow transplants were
used in 26 studies, peripheral blood stem-cells in 2, and 5 enrolled patients
receiving bone marrow or peripheral blood stem-cells.
The randomized interventions included the calcineurin inhibitors cyclosporine
A (CsA) and tacrolimus, the antimetabolite methotrexate (MTX), the mTOR
inhibitor sirolimus, the inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase inhibitor
mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) as well as anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) and
corticosteroids. Systemic corticosteroids (Pse) referred to methylprednisolone,
prednisolone and/or prednisone. Beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) was
examined separately due to the lack of systemic effects [22]. Study demographics,
setting, randomized interventions and outcomes are summarized in Table 1 and
the detailed study characteristics are shown on S1 Table S1 Appendix.
Quality Assessment
The quality assessment of individual studies is shown on S2 Table in S1 Appendix,
stratified for the pairwise comparisons. All randomized studies were deemed of
adequate quality (low or unclear risk of bias) to be included in the analysis. Across
each stratum, the majority of studies had also low or unclear risk of bias, and all
but one direct comparisons were considered free of serious limitation to warrant
downgrading the level of evidence (S3 and S4 Tables in S1 Appendix).

CsA/MTX or Pse/CsA/MTX; CsA monotherapy was compared over MMF/CsA,
MP/CsA or MTX monotherapy; ATG/MTX and Pse/ATG/MTX were compared
over MTX monotherapy; Pse/CsA/MTX over Pse/CsA; tacrolimus/MTX was
compared over tacrolimus/sirolimus (¡MTX), tacrolimus/MMF or beclo￾methasone (BPD)/tacrolimus/MTX. The relative effects are shown in Fig. 2, and
their grading of evidence on S3 and S4 Tables in S1 Appendix.
The use of MTX over CsA monotherapy [40, 42, 44–46] had no significant
impact on II-IV GvHD risk (OR 0.85; 95%CI 0.40–1.82; I2
555.2%), an effect
derived exclusively from studies in the myeloablative setting with sibling donors
and bone marrow transplants. The estimates did not alter (OR 0.76; 95%CI 0.29–
2.03) after excluding the sole study exclusively on chronic myelogenous leukemia.
MTX was inferior to CsA/MTX combination (OR 7.8; 95% CI 1.79–34.07,
NNH53) in a single trial exclusively in aplastic anemia [41].
The use of tacrolimus/MTX over CsA/MTX [30, 32, 35] was associated with
significant reduction of acute II-IV GvHD (OR 0.44; 95%CI 0.27–0.70, NNTB55;
I
2
545.1%), with high quality of evidence. All contributing studies used
myeloablative conditioning, but differed in donor type. The association persisted
(OR 0.35; 95%CI 0.19–0.63) after exclusion of [35] that showed imbalance in
baseline disease characteristics (advanced or non-advanced malignancy) that
potentially affected survival. The use of CSA monotherapy over CsA/MTX
combination [28, 33, 36, 43, 47] significantly increased the risk of II-IV GvHD

(OR 2.03; 95%CI 1.31–3.15, NNTH56), an effect consistent across studies
(I2
50). The effect was derived from studies with comparable setting (myeloa￾blative conditioning, bone marrow allografts and sibling donors), with the
exception of one study that randomized solely aplastic anemia transplants [33].
A total of six studies examined the use of add-on corticosteroids to prophylaxis
regimens, four as add-on to CsA/MTX combination [31, 34, 48, 49], one [22] as
add-on to tacrolimus/MTX combination, and one as add-on to CsA [37]. Add-on
corticosteroids to CsA/MTX (OR 0.73, 95%CI 0.34–1.57; I2
563%) showed no
benefit regarding II-IV GvHD. The pooled effect was derived from four studies in
myeloablative setting, using bone marrow transplants from sibling donors. One
study enrolled exclusively adult patients [31] and the remaining three enrolled
both pediatric and adult patients. After excluding [31], the effect remained
insignificant (OR 1.11; 95%CI 0.69–1.78) and was consistent across studies
(I2
50). Add-on corticosteroids to tacrolimus/MTX (OR 0.95;0.45–2.02) or to
CsA monotherapy (OR 0.53; 95% 0.24–1.15) had no benefit regarding II-IV
GvHD. It should be noted that one study [22] used oral beclomethasone
propionate (BDP), which is regarded as having minimal systemic effects.
Six articles examined the use of add-on ATG to prophylaxis, four as add-on to
CSA/MTX combination [24–26, 29] and the remaining two [50, 51] as add-on to
MTX monotherapy. ATG add-on to CSA/MTX prevented acute GvHD (OR 0.45;
95%CI 0.26–0.78; NNB55; I2
530.1%), an association of high quality evidence
(effect derived from four studies). Three out of 4 studies used rabbit ATG. The
association did not alter after excluding the single study using equine ATG [26]
(OR 0.41; 95%CI 0.19–0.89; I2
50%). ATG add-on to MTX monotherapy had no
effect (OR 1.61; 95% CI 0.64–4.07), with the two consisting trials using equine
ATG. Also, two trials on sirolimus/tacrolimus combinations for acute GvHD
prophylaxis over tacrolimus/MTX [20, 21] suggested protection (OR 0.22; 95%CI
0.05–1.11, NNTB55, effect of marginal significance).
MMF-based combinations were not pooled to calculate direct effects [23, 27],
as they were deemed highly heterogeneous with regard to donor type, donor
source and assigned prophylaxis. MMF/tacrolimus was comparable to tacrolimus/
MTX (OR 0.99; 95%CI 0.36–2.74) [23]; MMF/CsA was also comparable to CsA/
MTX (OR 1.56;95%CI 0.44–5.53) [27]. The triple combination Pse/CsA/MTX was
superior over Pse/CsA (OR 0.35; 0.13–0.89, NNTB57) [38] and Pse/ATG/MTX
was superior to MTX monotherapy (OR 0.23; 95% CI 0.06–0.90, NNTB55) [39],
both effects derived from single trials.
Direct effects for the secondary outcome (III-IV GvHD) are presented in Fig. 3.
The tacrolimus/MTX regimen was superior to CsA/MTX (OR 0.62; 95%CI 0.41–
0.95; NNTB512), an effect consistent across studies (I2
50). ATG add-on to CsA/
MTX prevented III-IV GVHD (OR 0.39; 95%CI 0.17–0.88;I2
558%), an effect
derived solely from studies using rabbit ATG. In subgroup analysis, this effect was

more pronounced across the two studies that used $15 mg/kg total dose of ATG
(OR 0.26; 95%CI 0.09–0.74). MTX was inferior to CsA/MTX while MMF/
tacrolimus may have resulted in increased III-IV GvHD over tacrolimus/MTX.
The remaining comparisons were not statistically significant (Fig. 3).
Indirect Effects
A total of 21 indirect comparisons were available for the primary outcome. The
network of indirect comparisons is shown in Fig. 1 (dashed lines) and the relative
effects are presented in Table 2. Nine treatment comparisons yielded a significant
association. The bulk of indirect evidence highlights the inferiority of
monotherapies (CsA or MTX) over double or triple combination regimens
(Table 2). Moreover, substitution of CsA for ATG was inferior to CsA/MTX (OR
12.4;95%CI 2.19–70, NNTH52) and addition of Pse to ATG/MTX was superior
to ATG/MTX (OR 0.14; 95% CI 0.03–0.74, NNTB53). Finally combining
sirolimus/tacrolimus with or without MTX was superior over CsA/MTX
combination (OR 0.10; 95% CI 0.02–0.49, NNTB54). ATG add-on to CsA/MTX
was comparable to tacrolimus/MTX (OR 1.02; 95% CI 0.49–2.12).
Discussion
We performed a meta-analysis of randomized trials to quantify the effect of
different preventive policies in acute GvHD prophylaxis after HSCT. Direct and
indirect evidence further underscored the inferiority of CsA or MTX
monotherapies over combined prophylaxis. Monotherapies represent outdated
practices and are of no significance in clinical practice. However, their inclusion in
this analysis is mandated for reason of completeness and integrity of the analysis.
The CsA/MTX combination was the most widely adopted prophylaxis used and
was considered the standard of care. There was substantial direct evidence derived
from the myeloablative setting, that CsA/MTX outperforms CsA monotherapy.
The evidence was deemed to be of high quality and supported the
recommendation of CsA/MTX as the standard prophylaxis in myeloablative
setting by the EBMT-ELN working group [5].
Interestingly, we found direct evidence on the superiority of tacrolimus/MTX
over the standard CsA/MTX regimen. In the context of these findings, tacrolimus/
MTX should also be another preferred strategy. However, tacrolimus is not widely
used over CsA across Europe and clinical experience is limited [52]. For example,
across the 72 centers that responded to a recent survey tacrolimus/MTX was
ranked fourth (used merely in 5% of centers that responded to the survey), well
below CsA/MTX (87%), CsA-MMF (11%) and CsA monotherapy (7%) [52]. The
EBMT-ELN working group noted that the lack of experience in Europe precludes
a firm recommendation; nevertheless tacrolimus/MTX is considered as equivalent
alternative to CsA/MTX. A recent registry data analysis further supports the
preferential use of tacrolimus/MTX over CsA/MTX-based regimens for siblings

(adjusted OR 0.65;95%CI 0.53–0.80) or unrelated donors (adjusted OR 0.79;95%
0.67–0.94) [53]. It appears that European centers, most of which have extensive
experience in using CsA-based prophylaxis, are reluctant to substitute CsA with
tacrolimus. However, within the context of available evidence that change of
policy may be warranted.
We also found high quality evidence that ATG add-on to CsA/MTX
prophylaxis significantly reduced the risk of GvHD grade II-IV and may further
justify the inclusion of ATG for unrelated donor transplantation [5]. A previous
Cochrane review [54] has also demonstrated a significant decline in II-IV GvHD
(risk ratio 0.68; 95% CI 0.55 to 0.85) after pooling all the pertinent studies, but no
subgrouping was performed on the referent prophylaxis (MTX or CsA/MTX). As
our data show, ATG has significant benefit as add-on to CsA/MTX, but no effect
as add-on to MTX monotherapy. ATG add-on to CsA/MTX and tacrolimus/MTX
(over the standard CsA/MTX) also demonstrated significant benefit regarding III￾IV GvHD prevention. Moreover, indirect evidence suggested that ATG add-on to
CsA/MTX is comparable to tacrolimus/MTX. Consequently, ATG/CsA/MTX
should be regarded as equivalent to tacrolimus/MTX in terms of GvHD
prevention. ATG use, as opposed to tacrolimus use, is popular across European
centers [52] but was not widely adopted across American centers [55]. If ATG

add-on is selected, caution on the policy of a center regarding CMV prevention is
warranted, as ATG is an independent risk factor for CMV reactivation [56].
Of note is that sirolimus plus tacrolimus combination may outperform
tacrolimus/MTX (direct evidence) and CsA/MTX (indirect evidence). However,
the risk of post-transplant thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) and sinusoidal
obstruction syndrome [57, 58] are a concern and sirolimus dosage adjustment is
strongly warranted [57]. The risk of sinusoidal obstruction syndrome further
increases with busulfan-based conditioning regimens [58]. Nevertheless, siroli￾mus/tacrolimus combinations arise as potential alternatives to standard regimens,
provided that the potential harms are taken into account.
Importantly, direct effects did not support the inclusion of add-on
corticosteroids to the prophylaxis regimen, with overall effect pointing to
insignificant decline. Corticosteroids are the mainstay of care for established acute
GvHD, and early initiation is warranted at a dose of 2 mg/kg methylprednisolone
upon clinical symptoms and signs (grade II or higher) by both randomized data
[59] and the expert opinion [5]. However, it should be emphasized that the
individual studies are clinically heterogeneous with respect to timing of
corticosteroid administration, CsA dose and folinic acid rescue [31, 34, 48].
Moreover, corticosteroid add-on has resulted in late occurrence of acute GvHD
[31, 48] and intensification of immunosuppression may lead to increased risk of
relapse as shown in previous studies [60, 61]. The risks of corticosteroid treatment
that include hypertension, infections or avascular bones necrosis may outweigh
any potential benefits, and EBMT registry data have shown that such an aggressive
approach may result in more deaths from infection and graft failures and reduced
overall survival [62]. The lack of significant effects in preventing GvHD coupled
with the risks of untoward effects and toxicities underscore that systemic
corticosteroids should be not considered as part of the initial regimen for GvHD
prophylaxis.
The effectiveness of MMF-based regimens remains an unresolved issue given
that few randomized studies have compared MMF-based regimens in myeloa￾blative allo-HSCT. The individual study data suggested the non-inferiority these
MMF-based regimens but treatment comparators and donors differed across
studies and data could not be pooled [23],[27]. We had no randomized trials on
MMF-based prophylaxis in the RIC setting, but it should be noted that recent
non-randomized data found no difference in II-IV aGVHD rates after RIC,
between patients receiving MMF/CsA (38%) compared to CsA/MTX prophylaxis
(33%, p50.5) [63]. The use of MMF/CsA is the most accepted prophylaxis in RIC
across Europe, given the sustained complete chimerism and prolonged remission
achieved after RIC [64].
Our findings are consistent with previous meta-analyses on the topic. More
specifically, Ram et al. [65] documented the superiority of tacrolimus/MTX over
CsA/MTX and the inferiority of CsA monotherapy over CsA/MTX. The authors
found no effect from adding corticosteroids to prophylaxis. Also, Theurich et al.
[54] noted a significant reduction of II-IV when ATG was added for GvHD
prophylaxis, as we did. The consistency of our associations with previous studies

strengthens the validity of our data. Moreover, our analysis provides some
additional insights by finely stratifying the referent arms (this analysis permits
relative effects to be derived for single agents and combinations) and provides
relative effects for treatments that are not examined directly (indirect
comparisons). In this context, our analysis is a comprehensive network of
comparisons that provides –within the limits of the methodology- the best
available evidence.
Our analysis did not address longitudinal outcomes, including relapse rates,
non-relapse mortality and overall survival. Variability in the duration of follow￾up, censored observations, lack of uniform reporting and between-study clinical
heterogeneity (with regard to conditioning regimens, the use of TBI, BM/PBSCT
transplantation and underlying conditions- all of which affect these outcomes
[53, 66–69]), preclude a robust comparison of long-term effects.
A number of limitations should be noted. Clinical heterogeneity remains an
important constraint. Meta-analysis cannot account for confounding variables
and the reported relative effects are unadjusted for potentially influential
covariates. Consequently, adjusting the effects for age, different conditioning
regimens, the use of TBI, different dosing and way of administration of the same
drug is not feasible. Additionally, the impact of differences in supportive therapy
could not be addressed. Second, performance bias is a concern since, in most
studies, arm assignment was not blinded to investigators, physicians or patients.
Third, outcomes may alter depending on if GvHD was a primary or a secondary
outcome in a contributing study. Fourth, the analysis refers to a single aspect of
immunosuppressive regimen selection, that is the risk of GvHD. Other aspects
that may influence the choice of immunosuppressive drugs such as age, donor
type, degree of matching, and preparative regimens could not be accounted for.
For example, T-cell depletion limits the problem of GvHD at the expense of
relapse, whereas more effective regimens may have high mortality from infection
negating the benefit of reduced GvHD. Fifth, III-IV GvHD was an under-reported
outcome across studies, as 27% of trials did not report the pertinent data. The
field of transplant medicine is moving towards individualizing treatment and this
study adds to our knowledge, providing a framework of relative effects for
regimens directly compared (direct effects) as well for those that were never
compared in a randomized trial (indirect effects). This matrix of effects can serve
as a basis for further research on the topic.
In summary, we systematically assessed the effects of GvHD prevention policies
after transplantation. The direct and indirect evidence accumulated from
randomized control trials ranked tacrolimus/MTX and ATG/CsA/MTX as
outperformers of prevention policies, noted the potency of tacrolimus/sirolimus
combination, verified the inferiority of monotherapies and highlighted the paucity
of randomized data in specific settings, including non-myeloablative transplant
recipients.
