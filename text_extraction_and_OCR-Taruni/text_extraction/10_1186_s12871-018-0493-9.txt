Abstract
Background: The discrepancy between demand and supply for liver transplants (LT) has led to an increased
transplantation of organs from extended criteria donors (ECD).
Methods: In this single center retrospective analysis of 122 cadaveric LT recipients, we investigated predictors
of postreperfusion syndrome (PRS) including transplant liver quality categorized by both histological assessment
of steatosis and subjective visual assessment by the transplanting surgeon using multivariable regression analysis.
Furthermore, we describe the relevance of PRS during the intraoperative and postoperative course of LT recipients.
Results: 53.3% (n = 65) of the patients suffered from PRS. Risk factors for PRS were visually assessed organ quality of the
liver grafts (acceptable: OR 12.2 [95% CI 2.43–61.59], P = 0.002; poor: OR 13.4 [95% CI 1.48–121.1], P = 0.02) as well
as intraoperative norepinephrine dosage before reperfusion (OR 2.2 [95% CI 1.26–3.86] per 0.1 μg kg− 1 min− 1
, P = 0.01).
In contrast, histological assessment of the graft was not associated with PRS. LT recipients suffering from PRS
were hemodynamically more instable after reperfusion compared to recipients not suffering from PRS. They
had lower mean arterial pressures until the end of surgery (P < 0.001), received more epinephrine and norepinephrine
before reperfusion (P = 0.02 and P < 0.001, respectively) as well as higher rates of continuous infusion of norepinephrine
(P < 0.001) and vasopressin (P = 0.02) after reperfusion. Postoperative peak AST was significantly higher (P = 0.001) in LT
recipients with PRS. LT recipients with intraoperative PRS had more postoperative adverse cardiac events (P = 0.05) and
suffered more often from postoperative delirium (P = 0.04).
Conclusions: Patients receiving ECD liver grafts are especially prone to PRS. Anesthesiologists should keep these newly
described risk factors in mind when preparing for reperfusion in patients receiving high-risk organs.

Background
According to the Organ Procurement and Transplant￾ation Network of the United States (US) Department of
Health and Human Services, the numbers of liver trans￾plantations (LT) in the US have constantly been rising
since the beginning of LT [1]: In 2016, a total of 7841
LTs were performed in the US. By contrast, the numbers
of LTs in Germany and in the Eurotransplant region
have been decreasing since a peak in 2010 [2, 3]. The de￾creasing organ donations combined with the persisting
high morbidity and mortality of patients on the waiting
list has led to a discrepancy between organ supply and
demand [2, 4] and therefore to the more frequent ac￾ceptance extended criteria donors (ECD) to the pool of
eligible donors [5, 6].
The most critical intraoperative moment for the
anesthesiologist during LT is the reperfusion of the liver
graft. An immediate and severe complication following
reperfusion is hemodynamic instability, the so called post￾reperfusion syndrome (PRS). PRS is defined as a decrease
of mean arterial pressure (MAP) of more than 30% during
the first 5 min after reperfusion and continuing for at least
1 min [7–12]. PRS occurs in around 10–60% of LT recipi￾ents [8, 9, 13]. Several risk factors for PRS have been de￾scribed: Older donor age, higher donor risk index, longer
cold ischemic time (CIT), severity of the recipient’s liver
disease, operation time and technique, hemodynamics
at time of reperfusion, and steatosis of the graft organ
[8, 13–20]. The mechanisms of PRS appear to be com￾plex and not fully understood [10, 21, 22]. In addition,
the transplantation of ECD livers has led to a decrease
in mortality for LT recipients on the wait lists at the
cost of increased perioperative complication [23]. Both
these factors have made it difficult to predict PRS. In
particular, the quality of the donor organ and its role as
risk factor for the occurrence of PRS as well as its asso￾ciations with patients’ outcome have been neglected in
the past.
Methods
Aim, design and setting of the study
We therefore conducted a retrospective analysis of all
LTs performed at our center. Primary aim of this study
was to identify predictors of PRS including transplant
liver quality assessed by both subjective visual assess￾ment by the transplanting surgeon and histological as￾sessment of steatosis. Secondary aim of this study was to
describe the relevance of PRS during the intraoperative
and postoperative course of LT recipients.
Patients and management
All patients receiving cadaveric liver transplantation from
the beginning of our center’s newly established liver trans￾plantation program in May 2010 until January 1st, 2014
were considered eligible for inclusion. Patients were ex￾cluded in case histological donor data or intraoperative
data were incomplete or in case of intraoperative severe
adverse events prior to reperfusion. Liver transplantation
was performed using an extracorporeal venovenous/portal
venous bypass. Anesthesiological management, bypass
and surgical procedures, as well as the immune suppres￾sion regimen have already been described by Moosdorf
and colleagues [24]. Anesthesiologists did not follow a
specific coagulation or transfusion management protocol:
Patient received at maximum 1 Liter of balanced electro￾lyte solution and volume replacement was subsequently
conducted with FFP in order to anticipate the coagulation
disorder. Transfusion triggers for RBCs were tailored to
the patient’s comorbidities and provided at the discretion
of the providing anesthesiologist. Our department’s stand￾ard operating procedure (SOP) for LT includes a TEM
after induction, 15–30 and 45–60 min after reperfusion,
seeking to keep normal coagulation parameters [25].
Data
Donor data
The following data were abstracted from the covering
letter of the donor organ: donor age, donor body mass
index, donor blood sodium concentration, donor alanine
transaminase (ALT) blood concentration, donor aspartate
transaminase (AST) blood concentration, donor bilirubin
blood concentration, as well as warm ischemia time (WIT)
and cold ischemia time (CIT).
Donor organ assessment
Donor livers were macroscopically assessed regarding their
fat content by the implanting surgeon before the recipient
operation on the preserved cold graft. Organs were cat￾egorized as either good, acceptable or poor, according
to EuroTransplant criteria. In addition, histological assess￾ment of the donor organ was conducted by the explanting
center (or if missing by the in-house pathology depart￾ment). Organs were categorized in three categories
depending on macrovesicular fat content (≥ one intra￾cellular vacuole displacing organelles): Grade 1 – fat
content 0–29%, grade 2 – fat content 30–59%, grade 3 –
fat content ≥60% [26, 27].
Recipient data
The following data were abstracted from the patient’s
medical chart, as recorded at the time of evaluation for
being listed for transplantation: Recipient age, recipient
diagnosis leading to transplantation, portal hypertension
(PoHT; defined by either esophageal varices, thrombopenia
or splenomegaly), laboratory model of end stage liver
disease score (labMELD; 10 x (0,957 x In(serum cre￾atinine) + 0,37 x In(serum creatinine) + 1,12 x In (inter￾national normalized ratio[INR]) + 0,643)) [28], and the

need for renal replacement therapy. From the electronic
patient data management system, concentrations of serum
bilirubin, serum AST, serum ALT, serum creatinine, inter￾national normalized ratio (INR) as well as renal replace￾ment therapy were abstracted after admission closest to
the beginning of surgery (preoperatively), at ICU admis￾sion immediately after surgery (postoperatively) and on
postoperative day (POD) 1,3,7 and 14.
The following data were abstracted from the paper-based
anesthesia protocol: Heart rate, mean blood pressure (arter￾ial line), boli of norepinephrine and epinephrine at time of
reperfusion, infusion rate of norepinephrine, infusion rate
of epinephrine, infusion rate of vasopressin. These values
were abstracted at induction of anesthesia, skin incision,
beginning of the anhepatic phase, and at 5, 10, 15, 30 and
60 min after reperfusion as well as at the end of the surgery.
Furthermore, the number of intraoperatively administered
red blood cell concentrates (RBCs), platelet concentrates
(PCs), fresh frozen plasmas (FFPs), the amount of intraop￾eratively administered fibrinogen, prothrombin complex
concentrate (PCC), the occurrence of hyperfibrinolysis
(by thrombelastometry [TEM]), asystole and cerebral
edema (temporary mydriasis after reperfusion) were ex￾tracted from the anesthesia protocol.
From the patients chart we abstracted the following
data from the postoperative period: primary nonfunction
(PND; re-transplantation or death within 7 days), early
allograft dysfunction (bilirubin ≥10 mg/dl on post-operative
day (POD) 7 and/or INR ≥1.6 on POD 7 and/or AST or
ALT > 2000 IU/L within the first 7 days), acute rejec￾tion (clinical diagnosis), surgical revisions, retransplan￾tation, sepsis, need for renal replacement therapy (RRT),
adverse cardiovascular events (asystole, resuscitation, non
ST elevation myocardial infarction, heart failure), adverse
central nervous events (delirium, intracranial hemorrhage,
seizures), duration of mechanical ventilation, intensive care
unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS), hospital LOS, and death.
Postreperfusion syndrome
PRS was defined as fulfillment of at least one of the follow￾ing criteria: (1) Decrease in mean arterial pressure (MAP)
of at least 30% at time of reperfusion, (2) administration of
an intravenous bolus of norepinephrine > 2 μg kg body
weight (BW) -1, (3) increase of continuous norepinephrine
infusion of ≥0.1 μg kg BW− 1 within 5 to 30 min after reper￾fusion, or (4) initiation of continuous vasopressin infusion
after reperfusion. According to our department’s SOP,
PRS was treated as follows: (i) 0.5 mg atropine before
reperfusion if heart rate < 80, (ii) NE boli and NE infu￾sion to maintain MAP, (iii) epinephrine boli and infu￾sion in case of significant bradycardia with hypotension
and decrease of SVO2 during reperfusion, (iv) infusion
of vasopressin if high doses of NA are necessary or NA
therapy ineffective.
Statistics
Categorical data with two categories each were tested
using Fisher’s exact test, with more than three categories
with the Chi squared test with Yates correction. Since
the sample size was > 100, central limit theorem applies
and normal distribution of continuous variables was as￾sumed without testing. Groupwise comparison of continu￾ous variables were therefore conducted using the t-test for
independent samples. Changes of continuous variables over
time were compared using a repeated measures ANOVA
test. If a time/variable-interaction was detected by the
ANOVA, a post-hoc t-test was conducted for each time
point. Survival analysis were conducted plotting Kaplan￾Meier curves and these were compared using the Log
Rank test. Agreement between visual organ assessment by
the surgeon and histopathological steatosis grading was
quantified by calculating an unweighted Cohen’s kappa.
Binary logistic regression analysis was used to determine
independent factors predicting postreperfusion syndrome.
Variables reaching a level of significance (P ≤ 0.05) when
univariably tested, were introduced into the multivariable
logistic regression model. Statistical analyses were con￾ducted using IBM SPSS 22, figures were created using
GraphPad Prism 6.0. A two-sided p-value ≤0.05 was con￾sidered statistically significant.
Results
Patients
A total of 172 patients received a liver transplantation
during the study period. 50 patients were excluded due
to incomplete histological data (n = 46), incomplete intra￾operative documentation (n = 3) or due to severe adverse
events prior to reperfusion (n = 1; need for cardiopulmo￾nary bypass due to laceration of the inferior caval vein). A
total of 122 patients were analyzed (Fig. 1).
Clinical characteristics of the study population are
depicted in Table 1. Recipients of LT had a mean age of
55 (54.9 ± 9.8) and a mean labMELD of 20 (19.8 ± 10.3).
The most frequent reason for transplantation was cir￾rhosis (57 of 122; 46.7%) followed by tumor (25 of 122;
20.5%). Organ donors had a mean age of 55 (55.2 ± 16.2),
were 46.7% female, had a mean BMI of 29 (28.8 ± 7.2),
and serum sodium, ALT, AST, bilirubin within the refer￾ence range. The mean CIT of the donor organs was 8 h
(8.3 ± 2.3), mean WIT was 44 min (43.7 ± 7.5).
Postreperfusion syndrome
Of the 122 liver transplant recipients, 65 (53.3%) devel￾oped PRS (Table 1). Patients developing PRS received an
organ more often due to acute liver failure (10 of 65 vs.
2 of 57, 15.4% vs. 3.5%, P = 0.03) and less often due to
cirrhosis (20 of 65 vs. 37 of 57, 30.8% vs. 64.9%, P <
0.001) compared to recipients not developing PRS and
suffered more often from PoHT (52 of 65 vs. 33 of 57,
Kork et al. BMC Anesthesiology (2018) 18:29 Page 3 of 11

80.0% vs. 57.9%, P = 0.01). Organ donors for recipients
developing PRS had a higher BMI (31.1 ± 8.2 vs. 26.4 ±
4.8, P < 0.001) and a higher serum sodium concentration
(149.1 ± 7.8 vs. 146.1 ± 8.4, p = 0.04) compared to organ
donors for recipients not developing PRS. Donor organs
for patients who developed PRS had longer mean CITs
(8.7 ± 2.3 vs. 7.8 ± 2.3 h, p = 0.04) and more often had an
extreme CIT of ≥10 h (17 of 65 vs. 6 of 57, 26.2% vs.
10.5%, p = 0.02).
Predictors of postreperfusion syndrome
In order to identify predictors of PRS we conducted a
binary logistic regression analysis with PRS as dependent
variable introducing known risk factors for PRS in the
model (Table 2). Only visually assessed acceptable (OR
12.2 [95% CI 2.43–61.59], P = 0.002) or poor (OR 13.4
[95% CI 1.48–121.1], P = 0.02) quality of the donor
organ and norepinephrine dosage before reperfusion
(OR 2.2 [95% CI 1.26–3.86] per 0.1 μg kg− 1 min− 1
, P =
0.01) predicted the occurrence of PRS. Interestingly, the
histological assessment of donor organ’s steatosis was
not a good predictor for PRS. This was not due to collin￾earity of the variables: the visual and histological assess￾ment differed significantly (p < 0.001) and agreed poorly
(cohen’s kappa 0.31, Table 3). For example, 21 of 122
donor organs were staged as acceptable or poor by visual
inspection but classified as stage 1 steatosis by histo￾logical assessment.
Postreperfusion syndrome and the intraoperative course
after reperfusion
LT recipients with PRS were hemodynamically more un￾stable after reperfusion until the end of surgery compared
to patients without PRS (Fig. 2): Recipients with PRS had
lower MAPs after reperfusion (P < 0.001; Fig. 2a) and
accordingly received higher infusion of continuous
norepinephrine (P < 0.001, Fig. 2b) and vasopressin (P <
0.001; Fig. 2c) compared to patients without PRS. Heart
rate and continuous epinephrine infusion after reperfu￾sion did not differ in LT recipients with and without
PRS (Fig. 2d and e). At the time of reperfusion of the
liver transplant, recipients with PRS received higher boli
of norepinephrine (1.5 ± 1.6 vs. 0.3 ± 0.4 μg kg− 1
, P = <
0.001) and epinephrine (0.3 ± 0.5 vs. 0.1 ± 0.2 μg kg− 1
; P =
0.01; Fig. 2f).
Furthermore, LT recipients with PRS received more
extensive hemotherapy intraoperatively: Compared to
patients without PRS, LT recipients with PRS received
more platelet concentrates (1.6 ± 1.8 vs. 1.1 ± 1.5 units;
P = 0.04; more fibrinogen (3.0 ± 3.2 vs. 1.7 ± 1.2 g; P =
0.01) and more PCC (1313 ± 1610 vs. 579 ± 1133 IU; P =
0.01; Table 4). There was no significant difference in the
amount of RBC and FFP administered as well as in other
intraoperative postreperfusion adverse events (Table 4).
Postreperfusion syndrome and the postoperative course
after transplantation
LT recipients with PRS demonstrated a more severe organ
damage after transplantation: During the first three postop￾erative days, AST was higher in patients with PRS (P = 0.02;
Fig. 3a), as was ALT, but without statistical significance
(P = 0.40; Fig. 3b). LT recipients with and without PRS
did not differ in bile retention, as postoperative serum
bilirubin concentrations were similar (Fig. 3c). Recipients
with PRS postoperatively had poorer organ function as
hemostasis was poorer compared to recipients without
PRS (P = 0.01; Fig. 3d). The inflammation marker procalci￾tonin as well as the kidney function marker serum creatin￾ine did not differ in LT recipients with and without
PRS (Fig. 3e and f).
Regarding postoperative adverse events, LT recipients
with PRS suffered more often from postoperative delirium

(8/65 vs. 1/57, 12.3% vs. 1.8%; P = 0.04) and major cardio￾vascular events (11/65 vs. 3/57, 16.9% vs. 5.3%; P = 0.05;
Table 5). LT recipients with PRS also tended to have a lon￾ger ICU LOS (11.7 ± 17.0 vs. 9.7 ± 15.7; P = 0.09; Table 5).
A Kaplan-Meier survival analysis for LT recipient survival
(Fig. 4a) and graft survival (Fig. 4b) did not show signifi￾cant differences.
Discussion
In this single center retrospective analysis of 122 LT recip￾ients, we found that approximately half of the patients suf￾fered from PRS (53.3%). Multivariable regression analysis
identified two predictors of PRS: Only visually assessed ac￾ceptable (OR 12.2, P = 0.002) and poor (OR 13.4, P = 0.02)
donor organ quality by the transplanting surgeon and
intraoperative norepinephrine infusion rate before reperfu￾sion of the liver transplant (OR 2.2 per 0.1 μg/kg/min, p =
0.01) were associated with the occurrence of PRS. LT
recipients suffering from PRS were hemodynamically
more instable after reperfusion compared to recipients
not suffering from PRS. They had lower MAPs from re￾perfusion until the end of surgery (P < 0.001). Hence,
they received more epinephrine and norepinephrine
before reperfusion (P < 0.001 and P = 0.01, respectively)
and higher rates of continuous infusion of norepineph￾rine (P < 0.001) and vasopressin (P = 0.02) after reperfu￾sion of the transplant. Moreover, LT recipients with
intraoperative PRS had a more complicated postopera￾tive course compared to recipients without intraopera￾tive PRS: They had more adverse cardiac events (P =

0.05) and suffered more often from postoperative delir￾ium (P = 0.04).
All 122 LT recipients were operated at the same
center with the same technique (venovenous/portalve￾nous bypass) and with uniform anesthesiologic man￾agement, guided by a SOP that included instructions
for the management of PRS. No changes in operating
technique or anesthesiologic management were made
during the study period, leading to a homogenous single
center study sample. Nevertheless, this study has several
weaknesses. Due to the retrospective design of the analyses,
data quality could be impaired. Histological data for our
analyses was limited to steatosis assessment. Analyses of
hemodynamics from hand-written anesthesia protocols are
often suspected to present “sugar-coated” hemodynamic
values. Although we cannot rule out that this was the
case, our data present clinically and empirically plausible
hemodynamics. At worst, hemodynamic stability is overes￾timated and the effects shown are even more pronounced.
The fact that this was a single center analysis combined
with the uncommon but consistent use of intraoperative
venovenous/portalvenous bypass limits the external validity
of our results.
Although rather on the top end of the range, PRS inci￾dence of 53% in our sample concurs with several other
studies [8, 10, 12, 17, 19]. The pathophysiology of PRS is
complex and not entirely understood. The abrupt influx
of cold, hyperkalemic and acidic blood into the circula￾tion, air or thrombotic embolization and the release of
vasoactive substances from the graft liver contribute to
PRS [29–31]. The rationale for using a venovenous/por￾talvenous bypass during the anhepatic phase at our cen￾ter is to ensure maximum safety of the procedure [24].

bypass reduces lower limb and mesenterial congestion
and therefore reduces the abrupt influx of hyperkalemic
and acidic blood into systemic circulation at the time of
reperfusion. Nevertheless, the use of a bypass during LT
surgery remains controversial [13, 32, 33]. The PRS effect
seen in our study is therefore likely to be predominantly
caused by vasoactive substances released from the graft.
With that in mind, PRS incidence does appear rather high.
A possible explanation for this contradiction may be
the fact that we used an extended definition for PRS.
PRS is commonly defined as a decrease in MAP of more
than 30% from the baseline value for more than one minute
during the first five minutes after reperfusion [7, 8, 10–12].
We extended the definition for PRS for mainly two reasons.
First, the treatment of PRS seeks to preserve hemodynamic
stability. At the time of reperfusion, anesthesiologists
expect a certain degree of hemodynamic instability and pre￾emptively treat a (soon to be) falling MAP with catechol￾amines [11], either as bolus or by increasing continuous
infusion of the very same. Since this preemptive treatment
conceals the occurrence of by-definition-PRS, we added (i)
the administration of an intravenous bolus of norepineph￾rine > 2 μg kg (BW) -1 as well as (ii) the increase of continu￾ous norepinephrine infusion of ≥0.1 μg kg BW− 1 within
the first 5 min after reperfusion as new criteria to the defin￾ition. Second, our clinical empiricism and the literature
have presented cases of prolonged vasodilation after re￾perfusion [34–36]. We thus included (iii) an increase of
continuous norepinephrine infusion up to 30 min after
reperfusion and (iv) the initiation of continuous vasopressin

Mean arterial pressure after reperfusion was lower (a), accordingly, norepinephrine (b) and vasopressin infusion (c) were higher in LT recipients
with PRS compared to recipients without PRS. Heart rate (d) and epinephrine infusion (e) did not differ. At the time of reperfusion, LT recipients with
PRS received greater boli of norepinephrine and epinephrine (f). P-values: repeated measures ANOVA; *: post-hoc t-test; mean and standard deviation

infusion after reperfusion as additional criteria for PRS.
This altered definition impedes comparability with other
studies and may overestimate PRS incidence compared to
the commonly used definition. However, our data ap￾pear clinically plausible and concur with description of
hemodynamic recovery after PRS by other authors [17].
In this study, multivariable regression modelling identi￾fied one donor related and one recipient related predictor
of PRS: graft quality – visually assessed by the transplanting
surgeon – and cumulative intraoperative norepinephrine
dosage before reperfusion of the liver graft. The variety of
risk factors and risk prediction models described in differ￾ent studies suggests that PRS may occur in an unpredict￾able manner or may be highly subjective to center-specific
effects [8, 13–20, 22]. The most frequent reported risk fac￾tors for PRS are longer CIT [15, 16, 18, 20] and intraopera￾tive hemodynamics prior to reperfusion [14, 15, 17, 20],
followed by graft steatosis [8, 16], operation time and tech￾nique [15, 18], severity of recipient’s liver disease [8, 19],
and donor age [13, 17]. One single center study retrospect￾ive analysis was unable to identify even a single risk factor
in a retrospective analysis of a sample of 261 LT
recipients [37]. Our findings that graft quality and hemo￾dymic impairment prior to reperfusion are risk factors for
PRS concur with several similar studies. However, it re￾mains cryptic why the multitude of these observational
studies generate such a diversity of findings when it comes
to predicting postreperfusion syndrome. Prospective multi￾center trials, the creation of an LT register or meta-analyses
investigating the prediction of PRS could help to shed light
on this matter in the future.
The increasing number of liver transplantations has led
to an increased demand of donor organs [1] and to the
growing use of organs from extended criteria donors (ECD)
[23]. A common quality marker for organs is fatty change,
or steatosis. Steatosis has indeed been linked to the occur￾rence of PRS [8, 16]. Studies have shown that transplant￾ation of liver grafts with moderate to severe steatosis can
very well be conducted without sacrificing recipient survival
but in particular, that increased efforts are needed when
dealing with these organs [26, 38]. However, macroscopic
assessment of the organ may not be qualified to assess
steatosis: Rey and colleagues have examined 36 livers of
organ donors which were explanted but not allocated.
Fig. 3 Clinical chemistry. Postoperative clinical chemistry of 122 liver transplant (LT) recipients, 65 with postreperfusion syndrome (PRS, black
circles), 57 without postoperative PRS (white circles). LT recipients with PRS suffered from greater postoperative transplant damage and poorer
transplant function during the postoperative course: Aspartat transferase blood concentration was higher (a) and blood hemostasis was poorer
(d) compared to LT recipients without postreperfusion syndrome (alanine transferase was higher but did not reach significance, (b) LT recipients
with and without PRS did not differ in gall retention (c). Inflammation marker procalcitonin (e) and kidney function marker creatinine (f) were
peaking higher during the postoperative course in LT recipients with PRS compared to recipients without PRS but did not reach statistical
significance. P-values: repeated measures ANOVA; *: post-hoc t-test; mean and standard deviation
Kork et al. BMC Anesthesiology (2018) 18:29 Page 8 of 11

The authors found that macroscopic appearance and col￾oring compared to histopathologic evaluation for steatosis
unveiled discrepancies: Most of the graft livers with histo￾pathologically confirmed mild degree of steatosis macro￾scopically appeared yellow, thus of false poor quality and
could have been transplanted. In our analyses, micro￾scopic steatosis evaluation was a worse predictor for PRS
than the visual evaluation of the transplanting surgeon.
This may be the case because surgeons likely assess the
organ not only by its color, but also by general appearance,
organ consistency, and size. It may even be the case that
information of the recipient’s medical history and the
knowledge that the organ was already rejected once by an￾other center or had a long CIT additionally influenced the
assessment. Therefore, the multitude of information may
have enabled the surgeon to predict PRS better than any
single variable (recipient status, CIT, steatosis, etc.).
We also found intraoperative norepinephrine infusion rate
before reperfusion to be a predictor of PRS. This also con￾curs with other studies that have identified markers of
hemodynamic instability prior to reperfusion as predictors
of PRS. One possible explanation for norepinephrine infu￾sion or hemodynamic instability is hypovolemia. This would
also concur with other studies that have shown lower central
venous pressure at time of dissection [14] or at time of re￾perfusion [17] as well as a higher requirement for transfu￾sion units [15] to be predictors of PRS. A second possible
explanation is vasodilatation or vasplegia which has been
linked to end stage liver disease [39, 40]. Case reports have
described vasoplegic syndrome to occur during liver trans￾plantation [31, 41]. However, differentiation between the
two can sometimes be complicated as both appear alike
[34]. A third possible explanation may be that these patients
already had a compromised cardiac function. E.g., Xu and
colleagues could link left ventricular diastolic dysfunction to
the occurrence of PRS in a cohort of 330 Chinese LT recipi￾ents [20]. Unfortunately, our data did not contain systematic
and detailed cardiac function assessment of the recipients
and the literature lacks systematic investigation of its impact
on the occurrence of PRS. Moreover, it has been suggested
by several authors that PRS could be only a sign of an
underlying problem. It could be that anhepatic hypovolemia,
vasoplegia and/or impaired cardiac function demask as PRS
intraoperatively. On top of it, patients receiving a LT
from ECD appear especially susceptible to severe PRS.

In this light, these patients should especially be opti￾mized regarding hemodynamics and acid-base balance
when awaiting reperfusion.
Similar to the prediction of PRS, data on the effect of
PRS on LT recipients’ outcome is inconclusive. In par￾ticular, the impact of PRS on hard clinical endpoints
such as primary graft nonfunction with requirement for
retransplantation and mortality is unresolved. E.g., some
studies show an effect of PRS on mortality [15, 18–20]
and others did not [13, 17]. In fact, we were not able to
show a significant association of PRS with primary non￾function (4.6 vs. 1.8%) and mortality (15.4% vs. 12.3%) in
this study population. This is most likely due to the
small sample size, again underscoring the need for mul￾ticenter registries. Regarding post-transplantation mor￾bidity, we could demonstrate in our sample that the
occurrence of PRS was associated with a higher fre￾quency of postoperative delirium (12.3% vs. 1.8%) and
major cardiovascular events (16.9% vs. 5.3%). While
other studies have demonstrated early allograft dysfunc￾tion [42, 43], ICU length of stay [43] and the need for
postoperative renal dysfunction [19, 20] we could not
substantiate these associations in our study sample.
Conclusions
The data of this study demonstrated that both the visual
assessment of the liver graft by the transplanting surgeon
as well as the intraoperative recipients need for catechol￾amines before reperfusion of the graft were predictors for
PRS at our center. Besides the known risk factors for PRS,
anesthesiologists should keep these newly described
risk factors in mind when preparing for reperfusion.
As the impact of PRS on short- and long-term hard
clinical endpoint remains inconclusive, further investi￾gations and possibly multicenter prospective registries
could ultimately resolve the impact of PRS on LT re￾cipients’ outcome.
