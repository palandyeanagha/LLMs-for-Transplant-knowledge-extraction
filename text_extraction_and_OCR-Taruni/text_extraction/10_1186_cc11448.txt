Current practice of perioperative fl uid 
administration – more questions than answers
Th e importance of optimal fl uid administration in the 
peri operative period is well recognized, since adminis tering 
insuffi cient fl uids or administering too much may both 
result in bad outcome. Th is challenge is further 
compounded by the fact that fl uid requirements vary 
greatly among patients. One of the recommended 
strategies is that of fl uid restriction, with the aim of 
preventing interstitial edema and postoperative weight 
gain that may lead to severe complications [1]. However, 
restrictive regimes of fl uid management have been using 
fi xed formulas based on body weight and have not, in 
general, individualized fl uid administration according to 
the real needs of the patient.
Another prevalent strategy is that of goal-directed 
therapy (GDT), which has been repeatedly shown to 
signi fi cantly improve both short-term and long-term 
outcome [2,3]. Th e GDT approach is centered upon the 
maximization (optimization) of cardiac output (CO) by 
incremental fl uid administration. According to a com￾monly used protocol, fl uid boluses should be repeatedly 
given as long as the resulting increase of the stroke 
volume (SV) exceeds 10% or when the SV decreases by 
more than 10% [4]. However, a reduction in SV >10% has 
been found to have very low sensitivity in justifying fl uid 
administration and may partially account for the fact that 
GDT is usually associated with the administration of 
larger amounts of fl uids compared with standard care 
[6,7]. Th e administration of large amounts of fl uids is a 
potential source of worry since these fl uids, especially 
crystalloids, do not stay in the intravascular space for a 
long period of time [8]. Moreover, a forgiving attitude 
towards aggressive fl uid administration may encourage 
practitioners with inadequate training to overload their 
patients with fl uid without appropriate monitoring.
Inadequacy of commonly used parameters in 
guiding fl uid administration
Th e most common parameters being used to guide peri￾operative fl uid management include clinical experience, 
urine output, mean arterial pressure and central venous 
pressure (CVP) [9,10]. Although these para meters are all 
important components of hemodynamic assessment, 
none of them has been shown to be a good predictor of 
Abstract
The administration of a fl uid bolus is done frequently in 
the perioperative period to increase the cardiac output. 
Yet fl uid loading fails to increase the cardiac output in 
more than 50% of critically ill and surgical patients. The 
assessment of fl uid responsiveness (the slope of the left 
ventricular function curve) prior to fl uid administration 
may thus not only help in detecting patients in need 
of fl uids but may also prevent unnecessary and 
harmful fl uid overload. Unfortunately, commonly used 
hemodynamic parameters, including the cardiac output 
itself, are poor predictors of fl uid responsiveness, which 
is best assessed by functional hemodynamic parameters. 
These dynamic parameters refl ect the response of 
cardiac output to a preload-modifying maneuver (for 
example, a mechanical breath or passive leg-raising), 
thus providing information about fl uid responsiveness 
without the actual administration of fl uids. All dynamic 
parameters, which include the respiratory variations in 
systolic blood pressure, pulse pressure, stroke volume 
and plethysmographic waveform, have been repeatedly 
shown to be superior to commonly used static 
preload parameters in predicting the response to fl uid 
loading. Within their respective limitations, functional 
hemodynamic parameters should be used to guide fl uid 
therapy as part of or independently of goal-directed 
therapy strategies in the perioperative period.

the response of CO to fl uid administration. Th is is true 
not only for the CVP [11,12], but also for more reliable 
preload parameters such as the left ventricular (LV) end￾diastolic area and the global end-diastolic volume [13-15] 
(Figure 1). Th is inadequacy is further refl ected in the fact 
that only one-half of critically ill and high-risk surgical 
patients, in whom fl uid loading seems to be indicated, do 
indeed increase their CO in response to fl uid loading 
(responders), while the other half (nonresponders) is 
loaded with fl uids unnecessarily [16]. Th e inadequacy of 
commonly used hemodynamic parameters as predictors 
of the response to fl uids stems from the fact that this 
response depends not only on the preload status, but also 
on the contractile state of the heart [17]. In making a 
decision about fl uid adminis tration it would therefore 
serve us best to rely on a measure of the slope of the LV 
function curve. Th is dynamic para meter is termed fl uid 
responsiveness, and is a measure of the change in CO in 
response to a change in preload [18].
In clinical practice, fl uid responsiveness is very often 
assessed by a fl uid challenge. Th is common clinical 
approach, which constitutes the fi rst step in most optimi￾zation protocols, has some inherent fl aws. Detecting the 
expected increase in CO is not a trivial task, because 
relying on changes in blood pressure alone may lead to 
many false negative results [19]. More reliable methods 
for the accurate assessment of the eff ect of a fl uid 
challenge include detection of a change in the CVP of at 
least 2  mmHg [20] or, preferably, a change in the con￾tinuously measured CO itself [21]. However, relying on a 
fl uid challenge to determine fl uid responsiveness may 
eventually result in detrimental fl uid overload in view of 
the large proportion of non-responders [16] and the need 
to determine fl uid responsiveness repeatedly in some 
cases.
We hope the reader is by now convinced that having 
parameters which can predict fl uid responsiveness 
accurately without the actual administration of fl uids is 
of great clinical importance. Th ese parameters, which we 
defi ne in this context as functional hemodynamic 
parameters (FHP) or dynamic parameters, are able to 
refl ect the response of the CO to a preload-modifying 
maneuver, to predict fl uid responsiveness, and to obviate 
the need for time-consuming, potentially damaging, 
repeated fl uid challenges.
Functional hemodynamic parameters based on the 
hemodynamic eff ects of a mechanical breath
To better understand this category of dynamic para￾meters, we need to briefl y revise the physiological 
principles of heart–lung interaction during mechanical 
ventilation [22-25]. Th e main hemodynamic eff ect of the 
increase in intrathoracic pressure during a mechanical 
breath is a transient decrease in venous return. Th is 
decrease in venous return causes a decrease in the right 
ventricular stroke output, and, after a few beats, in the LV 
stroke output. It is important to note that the fi rst and 
immediate eff ect of the rise in intrathoracic pressure is 
normally an aug mentation of the LV SV, which is mainly 
due to the inspiratory squeezing of the pulmonary blood 
volume, an important reservoir of LV preload, and due to 
the decrease in the transmural aortic pressure that is 
equiva lent to an eff ective decrease in LV afterload 
[22,26,27]. A mechanical breath will thus normally 
induce a cyclical biphasic change in LV ejection, which is 
composed of an early inspiratory augmentation followed 
by a decrease. Th is latter transient decrease in CO is a 
refl ection of fl uid responsiveness and becomes more 
pronounced in the presence of hypovolemia. Th ese 
changes in the CO are refl ected in the arterial pressure 
waveform, which may therefore provide readily measurable 
parameters of fl uid responsiveness (Figures 2 and 3).
Systolic pressure variation
Systolic pressure variation (SPV) is the diff erence 
between the maximal and minimal values of systolic 
arterial pressure during one mechanical breath (Figure 3). 
Th e SPV is composed of an early inspiratory increase in 
the systolic blood pressure, termed delta up (dUp), which 
refl ects the inspiratory augmentation of the CO, and a 
later decrease in systolic blood pressure, termed delta 
down, which refl ects the decreased CO due to the 
decrease in venous return (Figure 3) [18,28]. Th e SPV has 
been repeatedly shown, both experimentally and 
clinically, to accu rately refl ect fl uid responsiveness, and 
to do so better than commonly used hemodynamic 
parameters [13,14,28]. Th e SPV has been validated and 
used to guide fl uid therapy in a variety of surgical 
patients, including those undergoing major abdominal 
surgery [29], neuro surgical operations [30], vascular 
surgery [13], cardiac surgery [15] and scoliosis surgery 
[31,32].
Although the SPV has been found to be somewhat less 
accurate than pulse pressure variation (PPV) [15,16,33], 
its accuracy in predicting fl uid responsiveness is similar 
to that of stroke volume variation (SVV) [15,16] 
(Figure  1). When PPV and SVV are not measured 
automatically, SPV has a distinct practical advantage over 
the other two parameters in that it can easily and 
accurately be estimated from visual examination of the 
arterial waveform tracing [34], while eyeballing the PPV 
is much less accurate [35].
Pulse pressure variation
PPV refl ects the respiratory-induced changes in pulse 
pressure, and is calculated as the diff erence between the 
maximum and minimum pulse pressure values during 
one mechanical breath divided by their mean [33,36] 
Perel et al. Critical Care 2013, 17:203

(Figure 3). PPV is somewhat more accurate than SPV 
since, under constant conditions, the SV is proportional 
to the pulse pressure, and since the changes in the systolic 
blood pressure may be infl uenced by some degree of 
transmission of airway pressure [16]. A less appreciated 
charac ter istic of PPV is that when hypovolemia develops 
and the fi lling of the aorta is greatly decreased, the 
changing relation of the SV to the pulse pressure causes 
the associated increase in PPV to be much greater than 
the simultaneous increase in SPV and SVV [37].
Numerous studies have repeatedly shown that PPV is 
an accurate predictor of fl uid responsiveness with 
threshold values of 11 to 13% [17,25,38]. PPV has been 
validated and used to guide fl uid therapy in a variety of 
surgical patients, which include those undergoing major 
abdominal procedures [39], liver transplantation [40], 
cardiac surgery [15,41-43] and scoliosis surgery [44]. 
Additionally, a high PPV value was associated with higher 
infl ammatory response and lower organ yield in brain￾dead organ donors [45]. According to a recent report, 
PPV in the range 9 to 13% could not reliably predict fl uid 
responsiveness in 25% of anesthetized patients [46]. Th e 
possible reasons for this fi nding will be discussed later in 
Limitations of functional hemodynamic parameters. 
Automatic measurement of PPV is available in most 
monitors that use pulse contour analysis for the measure￾ment of continuous CO, and also in some standard 
monitors.
Stroke volume variation
SVV is the diff erence between the maximum and 
minimum SV during one mechanical breath divided by 
the mean SV (Figure 3). A threshold value of 10% was 
origi nally described in neurosurgical patients as diff er en￾tiating responders from nonresponders [47]. Continuous 
measure ment of this parameter has become possible with 
the introduction of pulse contour methods for the 
continuous measurement of CO. SVV has been validated 
and used to guide fl uid therapy in a variety of surgical 
patients, including patients undergoing cardiac surgery 
[15,48-51], major abdominal surgery [52,53] and liver 
transplantation [54]. Although from a pure physiological 
viewpoint SVV should refl ect best fl uid responsiveness, 
the inherent limitations of pulse contour methods make 
SVV somewhat less accurate than PPV [16]. In addition, 
because of diff erent nonstandardized proprietary algor￾ithms, SVV values measured by one monitor cannot be 
used interchangeably with those measured by another 
monitor without great caution [55].
Plethysmographic waveform variation
Since pulse oximetry is a standard non-invasive intra￾operative monitor, respiratory plethysmographic wave￾form variation (PWV) is the most commonly available 
dynamic parameter in mechanically ventilated anesthe￾tized patients [56]. PWV can be calculated as the diff er￾ence between the maximal and minimal plethysmo graphic

signal amplitudes divided by the amplitude of the signal 
during apnea or by the mean of the two values [57]. 
However, there are other variables and terms that are 
used to describe and measure PWV that may diff er from 
each other [55]. In the absence of an automated 
measurement [58], the variations in the plethysmographic 
signal should be simply eyeballed, although there are no 
data regarding the sensitivity and accuracy of such obser￾va tion. PWV has been shown to accurately refl ect changes 
in circu lating blood volume intraoperatively [31,57] and 
in fl uid responsiveness in patients undergoing major 
abdominal surgery [5,59] and cardiac surgery [58,60].
Th e major problem with the clinical use of PWV is the 
signifi cant impact of vasoconstriction (for example, 
during hypo tension or hypothermia) on the plethys mo￾graphic waveform. An increase in PWV may be the fi rst 
sign for development of a still-occult hypovolemia and 
should prompt the anesthesiologist to consider the 
immediate administration of fl uids.
Other functional hemodynamic parameters
A detailed description of the dynamic parameters that 
are based on echocardiographic assessment in critically 
ill patients is beyond the scope of this article. Th ese 
parameters include the collapsibility index of the superior 
vena cava [26], and respiratory variations in the diameter 
of the inferior vena cava, in aortic blood fl ow velocity 
(also measured by esophageal Doppler) and in the aortic 
velocity–time integral.
A dynamic parameter of major interest is the response 
of the CO to passive leg-raising [61], a maneuver that can 
theoretically be used in the many anesthetized patients in 
whom pressure-derived FHP cannot be used [56]. In 
contrast to a mechanical breath that normally reduces 
CO, passive leg-raising causes an endogenous fl uid 
challenge that will increase CO in responders. Th e execu￾tion of passive leg-raising necessitates a major positional 
change, which makes it impractical intraoperatively. 
Th ere are instances in the operating room, however, 
where postural changes may induce a hemodynamic 
response that might serve as a diagnostic maneuver of 
fl uid responsiveness. Such response is best evaluated 
when a continuously measured CO is available and in the 
absence of pain or discomfort caused by the positional 
change itself.
A recently described dynamic parameter that may be of 
potential interest intraoperatively is the response to a 
15-second end-expiratory occlusion, which may act like a 
fl uid challenge due to the temporary absence of the cyclic 
impediment in venous return [62]. More recently, passive 
leg-raising and the end-expiratory occlusion were shown 
to perform better than PPV in patients with low 
respiratory system compliance [63], but their value in the 
operating room still needs to be defi ned.
Limitations of functional hemodynamic parameters
To properly measure and interpret FHP it is imperative 
that their many limitations be well recognized. Th e fact 
that any dynamic parameter is composed of a stimulus and 
a response [64] makes the process vulnerable to many con￾founding factors, which limit the number of anesthetized 
patients in which these parameters can be used [56].

Spontaneous breathing
Th e hemodynamic eff ects of a spontaneous breath are 
physiologically diff erent from those of a mechanical one 
and are greatly aff ected by the inspiratory eff ort. Dynamic 
parameters, especially when automatically measured, can 
therefore be very misleading in the presence of spon￾taneous or assisted ventilation. Th is is a major limitation 
of FHP and is responsible for the large number of 
anesthetized patients (for example, those under regional 
anesthesia) in whom these parameters cannot be used [56].
Nonstandardized tidal volume
High tidal volumes may exaggerate the size of dynamic 
parameters at similar preload conditions [65,66]. Similarly, 
low tidal volume may produce an inadequate change in 
CO and considerably reduce the reliability of dynamic 
parameters. It is accepted that such reliability can be 
achieved only with tidal volume ≥8 ml/kg [67] or ≥7 ml/kg 
[68]. Attempts at standardizing the respiratory stimulus 
have been suggested [15] but have not been clinically 
implemented.
Nonstandardized airway pressure/respiratory rate
Other instances where the airway pressure may be 
inappropriately elevated or decreased may complicate 
the interpretation of observed dynamic parameters. 
Similarly, a very high respiratory rate was shown to 
reduce the respiratory variations in SV and its derivates, 
whereas respiratory variations in the superior vena cava 
diameter were unaltered [69].
Reduced chest wall compliance (for example, severe 
burns or severe edema of the chest wall, circular bandages 
or morbid obesity) may exaggerate the hemodynamic 
impact of the mechanical breath and cause inappro pri￾ately high values of dynamic parameters.
Prone positioning has been shown to signifi cantly 
increase PPV and SVV, although it did not alter their 
ability to predict fl uid responsiveness [44].
Increased intra-abdominal pressure may also increase 
dynamic variables signifi cantly even in the absence of 
fl uid responsiveness [70,71].
Air-trapping and positive end-expiratory pressure may 
result in high values of dynamic parameters denoting a 
real com promise of venous return and CO. High baseline 
values of dynamic variables may alert one to the possible 
detrimental hemodynamic eff ects of positive end￾expiratory pressure before its application [36].
Decreased lung compliance is usually not a limitation of 
FHP as long as the tidal volume remains adequate. 
However, although some of the key clinical studies on FHP 
have been carried out in patients who were in respiratory 
failure [36], recent evidence suggests that low compliance 
of the respiratory system reduces the accuracy of PPV [63].
Open-chest conditions may aff ect the ability of 
respiratory variations in the arterial pressure to predict 
fl uid responsiveness and have been the subject of some 
debate [22,72-75]. Since during open-chest conditions 
there is no inspiratory impediment to venous return, we 
believe that these variations are entirely due to aug￾mentation of CO (dUp) following inspiratory squeezing 
of the pulmonary blood volume, that they refl ect LV fl uid 
responsiveness, and that their absence should be a cause 
for concern [22].
Pediatric patients are characterized by higher chest/
lung compliance and higher vascular compliance, which 
may account for the mixed reported results for the use of 
dynamic parameters in this patient population [76].
Nonsinus rhythm
Since the respiratory-induced dynamic parameters rely 
on the individually measured maximal and minimal SV 
(or its surrogates), any arrhythmias may cause signifi cant 
inaccuracies. Nodal rhythm, however, may increase the 
size of respiratory-induced dynamic parameters by 
eff ect ively decreasing preload due to the loss of the atrial 
kick.

A neglected dUp
Th is early augmentation of LV ejection, which may 
become the dominant and only variation during 
hypervolemia and congestive heart failure [13,14,77], has 
little volume sensitivity [22,26-28]. Since this augmen￾tation refl ects the maximal SV and hence impacts the 
calculation of SPV, SVV and PPV, it may reduce their 
accuracy in predicting fl uid responsiveness, especially 
when their values are in mid-range. Th e presence of a 
signifi cant dUp may explain, in part at least, the recently 
reported inability of PPV values between 9 and 13% to 
accurately predict fl uid responsiveness (gray zone) [46].
Th e identifi cation of a dominant dUp, although rare, may 
suggest that the patient is not fl uid responsive and that 
the mechanical breath is in fact assisting LV ejection.
Right heart failure
Th e inspiratory increase in right ventricular afterload may 
cause falsely elevated SPV, PPV or SVV in the presence of 
right ventricular failure, which should be suspected when a 
patient has large variations but does not respond to fl uids.
Why should functional hemodynamics be used in 
all surgical patients?
Although dynamic parameters off er unique value in 
predicting fl uid responsiveness in mechanically venti￾lated patients, their penetration into mainstream clinical 
practice has been exceedingly slow [23]. A recent survey 
has shown that the management of high-risk surgical 
patients rarely includes the actual measurement of 
dynamic parameters although they seem to be frequently 
eyeballed [10]. Similarly, very few GDT studies have 
included any of the dynamic parameters in their 
protocols [2,3]. Th e few studies that have used dynamic 
parameters in the context of GDT have reported 
nonuniform results that deserve closer examination.
Using PPV >10% as an indication for fl uid loading in a 
small group of high-risk surgical patients resulted in a 
much higher fl uid administration and better outcome [39]. 
Th e very positive results of this study have to be 
interpreted with caution, however, as the patients of the 
control group seemed to receive a surprisingly small 
amount of fl uids that may account for their reported worse 
outcome [39]. More recently, an SVV (>10%)-guided 
approach led to the administration of more colloids, less 
hypotensive episodes and a lower incidence of 
postoperative compli cations [78]. In another study, where 
SVV >12% was part of a GDT protocol in high-risk surgical 
patients, the protocol group received more colloids and 
less crystalloids and had a reduced length of hospital stay 
and a lower incidence of complications than controls [52].
Other studies have found diff erent results. In patients 
undergoing major abdominal surgery, fl uid management 
guided by a goal of SPV <10% was also associated with 
slightly increased fl uid administration although organ 
perfusion and function were not aff ected [79]. Similarly, 
the administration of a fl uid bolus whenever the 
respiratory variation in peak aortic fl ow velocity was 
≥13% did not prevent the occurrence of hypovolemia and 
increased the incidence of postoperative complications 
when a background excessive fl uid restriction strategy 
was applied [80]. In contrast to all of the abovementioned 
studies, the use of the plethysmographic variation index 
to guide fl uid administration resulted in a signifi cantly 
lower amount of total volume infused intraoperatively 
and in lower lactate levels [81]. In summary, the current 
literature does not provide a robust evidence-base for the 
intraoperative use of FHP, one of the main reasons being 
the highly variable way in which the standard care group 
was managed during these studies.
When making individual decisions about perioperative 
fl uid management, however, it would seem physio logi￾cally and clinically irrational to disregard the obvious 
insights that are off ered by dynamic parameters 
[23-25,38]. Th ese parameters may on one hand off er an 
early, and sometimes the only, sign of occult 
hypovolemia, and on the other may indicate when to 
withhold fl uids since their administration may not be of 
benefi t. Th is may be especially important in patients with 
a known impaired LV function, one-half of whom have 
been found to be fl uid-responsive in spite of this 
diagnosis [15,49]. It is important to realize, however, that 
the presence of fl uid-responsiveness is not an absolute 
indication to give fl uids, and the fi nal decision has to be 
supported by the apparent need for hemodynamic 
improvement and by the lack of associated risk. When 
encountering values that are within the gray zone (for 
example, PPV 9 to 13%), decisions about fl uid adminis￾tration should be dictated by additional tools and by the 
risk–benefi t ratio of fl uid administration at that moment 
[46]. Last but not least, dynamic parameters may be of 
great help during GDT since they may indicate if and 
when CO can be further maximized by fl uids, identify 
when the fl at portion of the cardiac function curve has 
been reached (signifying the end of the optimization 
process), and prevent unnecessary fl uid loading.
Conclusion
FHP off er unique information about fl uid responsiveness, 
which may help detect fl uid needs and avoid unnecessary 
fl uid loading. Despite their limitations and confounding 
factors, these parameters should be used to guide fl uid 
therapy in all surgical patients in whom their use is 
appropriate, as part of, or independently of, GDT 
strategies.
