Objectives: On completion of this article, the reader should
have an understanding of the current perioperative manage￾ment of patients on long-term steroid therapy and of the
evidence guiding these recommendations.
Historical Context
In 1949, the glucocorticoid cortisone was developed, giving
physicians the ability to effectively treat adrenal insufficien￾cy.1 That same year Hench and colleagues discovered that it
was possible to use oral glucocorticoids for the treatment of
chronic rheumatoid arthritis, marking the beginning of the
use of these agents for immunosuppression and numerous
other chronic inflammatory conditions.2 Shortly thereafter, a
single case report in 1952 by Fraser et al described a 34-year￾old man with rheumatoid arthritis undergoing hip arthro￾plasty who developed hemodynamic collapse immediately
following his operation. He had been treated with cortisone
for 8 months with dosing at 25 mg twice daily for the
2 months prior to surgery; this had been discontinued
2 days before the operation. Autopsy showed bilateral adrenal
atrophy, leading the authors to suggest that his death could be
attributed to acute adrenal insufficiency.3 A case presented by
Lewis et al in 1953 described a 20-year-old woman with
rheumatoid arthritis undergoing knee surgery, who had
developed hemodynamic instability progressing to death
just 5 hours after surgery. Similar to the other case, she had
been on cortisone for 5 months preoperatively, which had
been discontinued the day prior to surgery. Autopsy showed
bilateral adrenal atrophy and hemorrhage.4 This case led to
the recommendation that patients on chronic oral steroids
should receive perioperative supraphysiologic “stress-dose”
corticosteroids (up to four times baseline dose) to avoid the
precipitation of adrenal crisis.2,4
Although it is well known that both medical and surgical
stress cause increases in cortisol production, the response
and cortisol requirements of patients with hypothalamic–
pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis suppression due to exogenous
steroid administration during stress are poorly understood.1
There is a lack of consensus regarding perioperative steroid
dosing for these patients. Furthermore, there is little histori￾cal data available regarding the true incidence of periopera￾tive adrenal insufficiency. The majority of studies base the
definition of adrenal insufficiency on hypotension and non￾specific symptoms (tachycardia, fever, lethargy, arthralgias,
myalgias, nausea, emesis, mental status changes), without
laboratory evaluation of the HPA axis. A review in 1976 by
Kehlet found that only 3 of 57 cases of hypotension suspected
to be due to adrenal insufficiency could be confirmed
biochemically.5

Abstract Supraphysiologic corticosteroid doses have routinely been considered the perioperative
standard of care over the past six decades for patients on long-term steroid therapy.
However, the accumulation of data over this period is beginning to suggest that such a
practice may not be necessary. The majority of these studies are retrospective reviews or
small prospective cohorts, but there are two small prospective, randomized placebo￾controlled trials, one prospective primate trial, and several systematic reviews address￾ing the issue. Based on this developing evidence, patients on long-term exogenous
steroids do not require high-dose perioperative corticosteroids and should instead
remain on their baseline maintenance dose, with the understanding that secondary
adrenal insufficiency should be considered for unexplained perioperative hypotension in
these patients.

Despite the lack of supportive evidence in the past 60 years,
supraphysiologic corticosteroid doses have been routinely
used in the perioperative period for patients on long-term
steroid therapy. However, numerous small studies and re￾views are beginning to question this practice. Given that
colorectal surgeons are commonly faced with the challenge
of operating on patients with inflammatory bowel disease
(IBD) who are on chronic steroids, as well as patients on
chronic steroids for a litany of medical issues, an understand￾ing of the history and debate surrounding perioperative
stress-dose steroids is critical in caring for this population.
Pathophysiology
The adrenal glands are responsible for producing a variety of
regulatory steroid hormones and catecholamines.6 The adre￾nal cortex’s zona fasciculata produces glucocorticoids, mainly
cortisol, and is stimulated by adrenocorticotropic hormone
(ACTH) from the anterior pituitary gland. ACTH is stimulated
by corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH), which is secret￾ed by the hypothalamus. Cortisol acts in cell cytoplasm and
has a role in metabolism, homeostasis, wound healing, car￾diovascular system maintenance, catecholamine production,
and self-regulation via a negative feedback loop to decrease
secretion of CRH and ACTH.1 The adrenal gland produces an
estimated 5.7 mg/m2 of cortisol daily (with levels peaking at
4–8 AM), which can increase 5- to 10-fold during times of
stress.1,7 Prolonged elevation of cortisol either endogenously
or exogenously can lead to side effects such as hyperglycemia,
immunosuppression, hypertension, delayed wound healing,
volume overload, and psychosis.1
Primary adrenal insufficiency occurs with destruction of
more than 90% of the adrenal glands by infection, inflamma￾tion, tumor, or hemorrhage, and results in decreased gluco￾corticoid and mineralocorticoid production.1 Secondary
adrenal insufficiency is far more common and is most often
caused by prolonged administration of exogenous steroids.
The resulting suppression of ACTH and CRH secretion causes a
decrease in endogenous glucocorticoid production and even￾tual adrenal atrophy.6 Patients with a normal HPA axis who
are exposed to increased levels of stress will secrete increased
amounts of cortisol, while patients exposed to chronic exog￾enous steroids exhibit blunted responses and have tradition￾ally been considered at risk for adrenal crisis during these
periods.8 The original recommendation of 200 to 300 mg of
hydrocortisone as a supraphysiologic dose stemmed from the
idea that this would be the amount of cortisol produced by a
maximally stimulated adrenal gland.7 There is widespread
disagreement about the amount, duration, and total exposure
of exogenous steroids required to cause HPA-axis dysfunction
and how long the glands take to fully recover function after
discontinuation of therapy.1
Existing Evidence
Over the past five decades, several studies have evaluated the
utility of giving supraphysiologic corticosteroids during the
perioperative period to patients on chronic steroids. The
evidence is lacking, however, because the majority of these
studies are retrospective reviews or small prospective
cohorts.9–18 There are currently two small prospective, ran￾domized placebo-controlled trials and one prospective pri￾mate trial addressing the subject.19–21
Although many of the studies on supraphysiologic periop￾erative steroids have their limitations, following their results
over time allows us to trace the current understanding,
dilemmas, and evolution of this topic. The earliest studies
examined adrenal insufficiency in patients whose steroids
were stopped preoperatively. In 1962, Solem and Lund de￾scribed a group of 30 patients who were followed after the
discontinuation of their chronic steroids 4 weeks prior to
surgery. They noted that no corticosteroid coverage was
required in the perioperative period to prevent hypoten￾sion.8,9 Six years later, Jasini et al studied a group of 41
patients with rheumatoid arthritis undergoing anterior syn￾ovectomy. They looked at 21 patients who were taking
chronic oral steroids stopped 18 hours prior to surgery,
compared with 20 control patients not on steroids. They
followed several biochemical markers of the HPA axis, includ￾ing plasma 11-hydroxycorticosteroid levels. Although both
groups showed an increase in 11-hydroxycorticosteroid in
response to surgical stress, the steroid group had overall
lower levels than the control group. However, this did not
manifest clinically. Interestingly, the one patient off steroids
for 48 hours preoperatively developed the only noted episode
of intraoperative hypotension, which was managed success￾fully with fluid resuscitation and hydrocortisone.10,22
In 1973, Kehlet and Binder prospectively followed 73
patients receiving long-term oral prednisone (5–80 mg/d)
that was discontinued 36 hours prior to surgery and
resumed 72 hours postoperatively. They measured plasma
cortisol levels at multiple time points and followed the
patients clinically. Seven of 18 cases of perioperative hypo￾tension could not be explained by sepsis or bleeding, but
only three of these seven patients had low cortisol levels
recorded and were considered as having true adrenal
insufficiency.7,11
A larger retrospective study in 1981 by Knudsen et al
examined 250 patients with inflammatory bowel disease
taking an average 40 mg of prednisone daily. One group
received supraphysiologic steroids in the perioperative peri￾od and the other group did not. Hypotension occurred in 22%
of the group receiving steroids versus 9% in the nonsteroid
group, but only 2 of 18 cases of hypotension were attributed
to adrenal insufficiency.7,8,12 The same year Lloyd prospec￾tively followed 61 patients on long-term corticosteroid ther￾apy for rheumatoid arthritis undergoing various orthopedic
procedures. He found no statistical differences in supplemen￾tal steroid requirement between the group who received
100 mg of hydrocortisone preoperatively and the other group
who did not receive perioperative steroids.13 His study
highlighted the idea that patients could receive “rescue”
doses of steroids when adrenal insufficiency was known to
be in the differential for perioperative hypotension.8
During the 1980s, researchers began exploring the idea
that patients may not need to be taken off of their baseline

steroid doses preoperatively and that perhaps supraphysio￾logic corticosteroid doses did not have to be as high as initially
hypothesized. In 1981, Symreng et al followed a prospective
cohort of 14 patients who underwent preoperative ACTH
stimulation tests. Patients with a normal test did not receive
additional perioperative steroids, while those with an abnor￾mal test were supplemented with 25 mg of hydrocortisone at
incision, followed by 100 mg hydrocortisone over the first 24
hours. Neither group demonstrated clinical evidence of adre￾nal insufficiency, suggesting that lower stress doses may be
adequate.8
In 1986, Udelsman et al developed a primate model to
more closely examine adrenal insufficiency and the dosing of
perioperative steroids. Thirty cynomolgus monkeys were
divided into four groups. Three quarters of the monkeys
underwent bilateral adrenalectomy and one quarter under￾went a sham adrenalectomy. In the 4 months of recovery
time, the adrenalectomized monkeys received glucocorticoid
and mineralocorticoid replacement and the sham monkeys
received normal saline. At the end of this period, for 4 days
prior to cholecystectomy, one group received subphysiologic
hydrocortisone, a second group received physiologic hydro￾cortisone, a third group received supraphysiologic hydrocor￾tisone, and the fourth sham group received no steroids.
Following cholecystectomy, the monkeys’ hemodynamics
and clinical outcomes were monitored closely. The group
receiving subphysiologic steroid replacement had significant￾ly higher mortality and cardiovascular instability. Both the
physiologic and supraphysiologic groups had similar out￾comes with no differences in wound healing, suggesting
that while physiologic doses were adequate and supraphy￾siologic doses were not particularly harmful, subphysiologic
doses had significant negative clinical consequences.21
With this information, subsequent studies explored leav￾ing patients on perioperative doses equivalent to their base￾line exogenous steroid requirements. Shapiro et al noted that
6 of 13 patients on corticosteroids following allograft neph￾rectomy showed evidence of HPA axis suppression on an
ACTH stimulation test, but had no clinical evidence of adrenal
suppression when continued on their maintenance predni￾sone perioperatively.15,22 Similarly, Bromberg et al examined
a prospective case series of 40 renal transplant patients on
long-term steroids and immunosuppressants undergoing
additional operations, and found that 63% had abnormal
ACTH stimulation tests, but 97% had normal or increased
urinary cortisol levels sufficient for stress. All were main￾tained on their baseline steroid dosing without clinical evi￾dence of adrenal insufficiency.2,16 In 1995, Friedman et al
followed 28 patients on chronic prednisone (1–20 mg/d) who
were kept on only their equivalent baseline dose while
undergoing an orthopedic procedure. There was no clinical
evidence of adrenal insufficiency in this prospective series.
Urinary cortisol measurements perioperatively and several
weeks later were not significantly different or predictive of
clinical outcomes.17
By the late 1990s, there was a wealth of observational data
collected regarding perioperative supraphysiologic steroid
dosing, but no randomized clinical trials. In 1997, Glowniak
and Loriaux performed a randomized double-blinded trial on
18 men undergoing surgery who had received at least
2 months of daily prednisone. An ACTH stimulation test
showing inadequate response was necessary for inclusion.
All patients received their baseline prednisone dose. In
addition, one group of six patients received 100 mg of
hydrocortisone before surgery, then 25 mg every 6 hours
for 2 days, and 25 mg every 12 hours for one day. The other
group of 12 patients received normal saline in the same
dosing schedule. There was no statistical difference in hypo￾tension and heart rate before, during, or after the procedure.
The authors asserted that supplemental stress-dose steroids
do not prevent perioperative hypotension, although their
study may not have been powered to detect a statistical
difference.19
A second randomized double-blind crossover study was
performed in 1999 by Thomason et al. They examined renal
and cardiac patients on prednisone (5–10 mg/d) and other
immunosuppressive medications requiring gingival surgery
in at least 2-month quadrants. Twenty patients were included
and randomly received either 100 mg hydrocortisone or
placebo on their first surgery and the opposite on their
second surgery. A postprocedure ACTH level was drawn
and blood pressure was monitored closely. The authors found
no clinical manifestation of adrenal insufficiency despite
some patients exhibiting HPA suppression based on ACTH
levels, and concluded that stress-dose steroids were not
required.20
Most recently, Zaghiran et al studied patients with inflam￾matory bowel disease. In their retrospective review of 38
patients who were not on steroids at the time of major
colorectal procedure, but had taken at least 5 mg prednisone
for greater than 1 week in the past year, they compared a
group receiving supraphysiologic hydrocortisone (100 mg
every 8 h for 24 h, tapered to 20 mg daily over 3 d) with a
group not receiving perioperative steroids. They noted an
increase in heart rate in the steroid group, but otherwise no
difference in hemodynamic stability or need for rescue
steroids. They concluded that IBD patients could be safely
managed without stress-dose steroids.23 Zaghiran’s group
went on to study 32 IBD patients undergoing major colorectal
surgery. Patients on steroids at the time of surgery were given
intravenous (IV) hydrocortisone (one-third equivalence of
baseline at incision tapering to one-sixth equivalence of
baseline every 12 hours on postoperative day 3) and patients
not currently on steroids (but with a history of steroid use in
the last year) were given no extra therapy. Hypotensive
events were similar between groups and the authors sug￾gested that their new, low-dose perioperative regimen could
be appropriate for this population.24
Several systematic reviews, including a Cochrane Re￾view, have summarized the available evidence regarding
perioperative supraphysiologic corticosteroid administra￾tion over the past 20 years; however, recommendations
have not remained consistent during this period.1,2,8,22,25
They do agree that the doses in the range of 200 to 300 mg
of hydrocortisone once recommended are probably too
high and put patients at risk for steroid-induced side

effects. In 1994, Salem et al felt that patients receiving
greater than 20 to 30 mg of prednisone per day were at a
reasonable risk of HPA-axis suppression and should have
biochemical testing of the HPA axis if possible. If this was
not available or there was clinical evidence of adrenal
insufficiency, then perioperative steroids should be given
and adjusted based on the estimated surgical stress. Pa￾tients on chronic steroids who undergo minor procedures
(hernia repair, colonoscopy) should get a single dose of
25 mg hydrocortisone, moderate procedures (open chole￾cystectomy, colon resection, hysterectomy, joint replace￾ment) should get 50 to 75 mg hydrocortisone for 1 to
2 days, and major procedures (abdominoperineal resec￾tion, pancreaticoduodenectomy) should get 100 to 150 mg
hydrocortisone for 2 to 3 days.2 These recommendations
remained similar in a 2001 Journal of the American Medical
Association review by Coursin and Wood, which stated that
patients should get their baseline oral steroid in IV form and
a stress dose based on the surgical procedure. Dosing was
identical to Salem et al’s recommendation except Coursin
and Wood recommended a steroid taper on postoperative
day 1 and 2 for both moderate and major procedures.1
A 2008 systemic review by Marik and Varon included
nine studies and 315 patients. Meta-analysis was not
possible due to varied outcome measures. Their conclusion
reflects a changing paradigm, emphasizing that many
biochemical tests are too sensitive and do not translate
into clinical outcomes. For most patients, continuing the
baseline steroid dose is appropriate and recommended—
with the awareness that stress-dose steroids could be
administered in patients with hypotension unresponsive
to standard measures.22 Yong et al echo this change in their
Cochrane Review, which includes only 37 patients from the
randomized controlled trials. These trials suggest that
supraphysiologic corticosteroid dosing is not necessary
preoperatively to prevent adrenal insufficiency, but that
current evidence is not adequate to fully support or refute
this claim.25
Conclusion
In the 60 years since Fraser reported the first case of periop￾erative adrenal crisis in a patient on exogenous steroids, very
little progress has been made regarding recommendations for
these patients. The numerous retrospective or small-scale
studies and the inherent low incidence of perioperative
adrenal insufficiency highlight the need for a large, prospec￾tive, randomized controlled trial. In specialties like colorectal
surgery that commonly treat patients on long-term steroids,
adrenal insufficiency should remain on the differential diag￾nosis of perioperative hypotension, but it is far less common
than hemorrhage or sepsis. Modern biochemical tests have
the ability to detect changes in cortisol and ACTH levels, but
these are not always proven to be clinically significant. Based
on the existing evidence, it is recommended that patients on
long-term exogenous steroids do not require the high-dose
corticosteroids that were once the standard of care. Rather,
patients should remain on their baseline maintenance doses
throughout the perioperative period and be treated for
hypotension that is otherwise unresponsive or unexplained
with a rescue dose of steroids.
