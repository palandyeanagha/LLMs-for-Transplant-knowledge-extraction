Abstract
The European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) guidelines recommend the Royal Free Hospital-Nutritional Prioritizing Tool
(RFH-NPT) to identify malnutrition risk in patients with liver disease. However, little is known about the application of the RFH-NPT to screen for
the risk of malnutrition in China, where patients primarily suffer from hepatitis virus-related cirrhosis. A total of 155 cirrhosis patients without liver
cancer or uncontrolled co-morbid illness were enrolled in this prospective study. We administered the Nutritional Risk Screening 2002 (NRS￾2002), RFH-NPT, Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST) and Liver Disease Undernutrition Screening Tool (LDUST) to the patients within
24 h after admission and performed follow-up observations for 1·5 years. The RFH-NPT and NRS-2002 had higher sensitivities (64·8 and 52·4 %)
and specificities (60 and 70 %) than the other tools with regard to screening for malnutrition risk in cirrhotic patients. The prevalence of nutritional
risk was higher under the use of the RFH-NPT against the NRS-2002 (63 v. 51 %). The RFH-NPT tended more easily to detect malnutrition risk in
patients with advanced Child–Pugh classes (B and C) and lower Model for End-stage Liver Disease scores (<15) compared with NRS-2002. RFH￾NPT score was an independent predictive factor for mortality. Patients identified as being at high malnutrition risk with the RFH-NPT had a higher
mortality rate than those at low risk; the same result was not obtained with the NRS-2002. Therefore, we suggest that using
the RFH-NPT improves the ability of clinicians to predict malnutrition risk in patients with cirrhosis primarily caused by hepatitis virus infection
at an earlier stage.

Prognostic value
Malnutrition is a very common and serious complication of cir￾rhosis, with a prevalence ranging from 60 to 85 %(1–4)
. The onset
and/or severity of malnutrition proceeds from a compromised
nutritional state to an obvious loss of weight and finally to a lean
body mass. It is not only associated with the progression of liver
dysfunction(5) but is also related to complications of liver cirrho￾sis, such as infections, hepatic encephalopathy and ascites(6,7)
.
Early nutritional intervention is essential to reduce the length
of hospital stay and healthcare-associated costs, improve quality
of life and decrease the mortality rate(8,9)
. However, nutritional
intervention is usually delayed owing to the failure to assess
the risk of malnutrition and the differences in the accuracy of
screening tools(10)
.
Nutritional risk is defined as the ‘chances of a better or
worse outcome from disease or surgery according to actual or
potential nutritional and metabolic status’
(11)
. Several nutrition
screening tools have been developed to predict the potential or
existing risk of disease-related malnutrition. In particular, the

Nutritional Risk Screening 2002 (NRS-2002) and Royal Free
Hospital-Nutritional Prioritizing Tool (RFH-NPT) are validated
screening tools for hospitalised patients that are recommended
by the European Society of Parenteral Enteral Nutrition
guidelines(12)
. The RFH-NPT was first developed in a multicentre
trial in the UK to detect nutritional status in patients with chronic
liver disease(13)
. It is easily applied in the clinical setting, which
enables even non-specialist staff to efficiently utilise the tool, sav￾ing time. Patients are separated into low-, medium- or high-risk
categories according to five measurements, including BMI,
unplanned weight loss, dietary intake, the severity of hepatitis
and interference with food intake by current complications
(e.g. ascites, general fluid overload). The NRS-2002 is another
simple tool primarily based on the indications for nutritional
support in 2002(14)
. It combines several variables, including
the percentage of weight loss, BMI, a reduction in food intake
and the presence of disease and its severity(14,15)
. A comparison
suggested that the RFH-NPT was more sensitive than the
NRS-2002 for the identification of liver patients at risk for
malnutrition(16,17)
. However, the studies regarding the use of
the RFH-NPT to assess the risk of malnutrition in patients with
liver disease were mainly performed in Europe(16,17)
, where alco￾holic liver disease is the primary aetiology of liver cirrhosis and
there is a higher prevalence of malnutrition. In contrast, most
cases of liver cirrhosis are due to viral hepatitis in China, render￾ing the evaluation of alcohol consumption in the RFH-NPT
irrelevant in Chinese populations. Therefore, we investigated
whether the assessment of the risk of malnutrition by the
RFH-NPT was still superior to assessment with the NRS-2002
in China by comparing them with the results obtained with
the Royal Free Hospital-Global Assessment (RFH-GA).
Patients and methods
Patients
We conducted a prospective study with eligible adult patients
who were seen in the Department of Infectious Diseases and
Hepatopathy at the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi’an Jiaotong
University between October 2015 and May 2017. We screened
258 patients who had been diagnosed with cirrhosis based on
clinical, biochemical, histological, radiological (ultrasound or
computed tomography showing a lobulated liver or/and
unequivocal signs of portal hypertension) and/or elastographic
(defined as liver stiffness >14 kPa) criteria and advanced disease.
Patients were subsequently excluded if they also had liver cancer
or if they had any uncontrolled co-morbid illness, such as uncon￾trolled diabetes mellitus, tuberculosis, AIDS, chronic renal
failure, muscle disease, rheumatological disease, disease of
the digestive tract, parasitic disease or active drug abuse.
Patients with uncontrolled joint disease and neuropathy were
also excluded. Finally, a total of 155 cirrhosis patients were
enrolled in the present day and were followed up until the date
of death or for 1·5 years. After receiving informed consent from
each patient, blood samples, which were used for biochemistry
assessments, and anthropometric parameters were collected.
The nutritional risk screening assessments were administered
according to the respective protocols within 24 h after the
admission of each patient to the department(4)
. This project
was approved by the ethics committee at Xi’an Jiaotong
University.
Nutrition status assessment
In liver cirrhosis patients, nutritional status can be assessed using
the RFH-GA(18)
. The RFH-GA incorporates both subjective and
objective variables to assess nutrition, including BMI, mid-arm
muscle circumference and dietary intake. In the case of fluid
retention, BMI needs to be corrected for the patient’s dry weight,
commonly estimated by the postparacentesis body weight or the
weight recorded before fluid retention if available, or by sub￾tracting a percentage of the weight based upon the severity of
the ascites (mild 5 %; moderate 10 % and severe 15 %), with
an additional 5 % subtracted if bilateral pedal oedema is present,
as described in several studies. Then, the dry-weight BMI is cal￾culated by dividing the patient’s estimated dry weight (kg) by the
square of the patient’s height (m). The triceps skinfold thickness
(TSF, mm) and mid-arm circumference (MAC, cm) were mea￾sured using Holtain/Tanner-Whitehouse skinfold calipers.
These two measurements are used to calculate the mid-arm
muscle circumference: MAMC (cm) = MAC (cm) – (3·14 ×
TSF(cm)). Measures of the mid-arm muscle circumference
below the 5th percentile are indicative of a risk of malnutrition.
With acknowledgement of the European Association for the
Study of the Liver (EASL) as an optimal one for dietary assess￾ment in patients with cirrhosis(19)
, the random 2-d 24-h dietary
recall is an easy and rapid method to conduct(20,21)
. As described
previously(20,21)
, the food and beverage consumption of the par￾ticipants was collected over 2 d (one weekday and one weekend
day) by our experienced dietitian. The individual intakes of
energy and nutrients relating to metabolic diseases on each
day were calculated according to the China Food
Composition(20)
. The dietary intake was estimated and categor￾ised as adequate if it met the requirements calculated by
Schofield’s modification of the Harris–Benedict equation, inad￾equate if it failed to meet the estimated requirements but
exceeded 2092 kJ/d (500 kcal/d) and negligible if it provided
<2092 kJ/d (<500 kcal/d)(18)
.
Nutritional risk screening tools
NRS-2002: The NRS-2002 is a nutrition screening tool recom￾mended by the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and
Metabolism guidelines(14)
. It includes three components: the
nutritional score (BMI, weight loss and dietary intake), the dis￾ease severity score and the age score (age > 70 years)(15)
.
Patients are classified as having no or low risk when they have
a total score <3 or as having a moderate or high risk when they
have a total score ≥3.
RFH-NPT: As described previously, the RFH-NPT is a novel
nutrition screening tool developed in the UK(13)
. It includes three
major steps: (1) those who have alcoholic hepatitis or are under￾going tube feeding are immediately evaluated as high risk with￾out proceeding to the next step; (2) those who do not have
alcoholic hepatitis and are not undergoing tube feeding are
assessed for fluid overload and its impact on food intake and
weight loss and (3) those who do not have fluid overload are
1294 Y. Wu et al.
https://doi.org/10.1017/S0007114520002366 Published online by Cambridge University Press

assessed for nutritional status (BMI, unplanned weight loss and
daily dietary intake). Patients are stratified as being at low risk if
they have a score of 0, moderate risk if they have a score of 1 and
high risk if they have a score of 2–7.
Malnutrition Universal Screening (MUST): The MUST
includes three categories: current BMI, unintentional weight loss
and the presence of any acute disease that could compromise
nutritional intake for >5 d.
Liver Disease Undernutrition Screening Tool (LDUST): The
LDUST assesses the six factors that were identified as having
the strongest associations with malnutrition in patients with a
chronic disease(22)
. It consists of six questions addressing these
factors, namely, nutrient intake, weight loss, loss of subcutane￾ous fat, loss of muscle mass, fluid accumulation and a decline in
functional status. The three potential patient responses are
labelled column A, column B and column C, indicating no
signs of undernutrition, ‘mild to moderate’ undernutrition and
‘moderate to severe’ undernutrition.
Medical assessment
Anthropometric measurements, such as BMI (kg/m2
), MAC (cm)
and TSF (mm), were obtained by specialist staff in our depart￾ment. The measurements of BMI, MAC and TSF were described
previously(2)
.
Laboratory parameters associated with malnutrition, such as
the total serum protein level (g/l), albumin level (g/l) and total
lymphocyte count, were obtained from routine clinical laboratory
measurements (RCLM) in the Department of Clinical Laboratory of
First Affiliated Hospital of Xi’an Jiaotong University.
Based on biochemical data collected from medical records,
the Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) and Child–
Pugh scores were calculated to estimate disease severity.
Sample size estimation
The sample size was estimated based on the malnutrition rates in
patients with cirrhosis of 44·6 % assessed by the NRS-2002 and
50·7 % assessed by the RFH-NPT(16)
. The reported sensitivity
and specificity of nutritional risk screening by the NRS-2002 vary
widely, with values of 50–86 and 21–93 %, respectively(23)
. The
calculated minimum sample size was 96, with a sensitivity and
specificity of 50 %, an α of 0·05 and a power of 85 %(24)
.
Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 23.0. The con￾tinuous variables are described as mean values and standard
deviations or as medians with ranges. The differences between
means were analysed using independent Student’s t tests.
Nominal variables are described as numbers or percentages,
and their differences were analysed with Pearson’s χ2 test,
Fisher’s exact test or the McNemar test. Observations were col￾lected until a mean of 1·5 years from admission. The sensitivity
and specificity were calculated for the various screening tools
compared with the RFH-GA. Receiver operating characteristic
curve analysis was performed using the RFH-GA as the refer￾ence. Cox regression analysis, Kaplan–Meier analysis and χ2 tests
were conducted for the prediction and comparison of survival in
patients with NRS-2002 scores <3 v. those with NRS-2002 scores
≥3 and those with RFH-NPT scores <2 v. those with RFH-NPT
scores ≥2 at admission. Survival curves were generated using
GraphPad Prism 5. Differences were considered significant at
P < 0·1 for the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis
and P < 0·05 for the other analyses.
Results
General characteristics of patients
The main patient characteristics are presented in Table 1. A total
of 155 patients were ultimately enrolled (females 61, 39·4 %;
males 94, 60·6 %) in the analysis. The mean age was 49·40 (SD
5·30) (median 56, range 33–61) years. The majority of patients
(139/155, 90 %) had hepatitis virus-related cirrhosis; 1 %
(2/155) of the patients were affected by alcohol-related cirrhosis
and the remaining 9 % (14/155) of the patients had other
aetiologies. Among those with hepatitis virus-related cirrhosis,
59·4 % (92/155) of the patients were infected with hepatitis B
virus (HBV), and 30·3 % (47/155) were infected with hepatitis
C virus (HCV). All hepatitis virus-infected patients received anti￾viral treatment in our study (data not shown). The mean patient
MELD score was 6·80 (SD 3·02). Fifty-nine (38 %) patients had
Child–Pugh class C cirrhosis. A total of 31·6 % (49/155) of the
patients were diagnosed with compensated cirrhosis, and
68·4 % (106/155) had decompensated cirrhosis. A total of
9·7 % (15/155) and 46·5 % (72/155) of the patients presented
with hepatic encephalopathy and ascites, respectively. All
patients with encephalopathy received treatment with
branched-chain amino acids, and all patients with ascites
received treatment with diuretics (data not shown). The overall
median BMI, MAC and TSF were 26·17 (20·42–27·41) kg/m2
, 29·0
(25·5–32·0) cm and 23·0 (9·0–36·0) mm, respectively. Twenty￾five (16·1 %) patients died during follow-up, and 16 (10·3 %)
were lost to follow-up due to incorrect contact information. In
addition, no patients died from drinking alcohol.
The basic clinical parameters in patients with or without
decompensated cirrhosis are shown in online Supplementary
Table S1. The sex and age distributions did not differ between
the groups with and without decompensated cirrhosis. The com￾pensated and decompensated cirrhosis groups had no signifi￾cant differences in BMI or the levels of serum creatinine,
blood urea nitrogen and ferroprotein. The other remaining clini￾cal parameters were significantly lower in the decompensated
cirrhosis group than in the group without decompensated cirrho￾sis. Decompensated cirrhosis patients had relatively higher
Child–Pugh class cirrhosis and MELD, NRS-2002 and RFH-NPT
scores than compensated cirrhosis patients. Among the 106
decompensated cirrhosis patients, 14·2 % (15/106) and 70 %
(71/106) presented with hepatic encephalopathy and ascites,
respectively. In summary, patients diagnosed with decompen￾sated cirrhosis had worse anthropometric measurements and
laboratory parameters than patients with compensated cirrhosis.
Effectiveness of nutrition risk screening tools compared
with the Royal Free Hospital-Global Assessment
The RFH-GA is a subjective index for nutritional assessment. To
determine which screening tools accurately detected nutritional

risk, we analysed the effectiveness of each tool by comparing its
performance with that of the RFH-GA. The LDUST had the high￾est sensitivity and lowest specificity of the screening tools (69
and 10 %, respectively); the MUST had the lowest sensitivity
(38·6 %) and the RFH-NPT had a higher sensitivity than the
NRS-2002 (sensitivity 64·8 and 52·4 %, respectively) (Table 2).
According to the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis
(Fig. 1), the RFH-NPT and NRS-2002 were able to predict nutri￾tional risk in patients with liver cirrhosis (AUC 0·647 and 0·612,
respectively). We thus selected the RFH-NPT and NRS-2002 for
more detailed analyses.

Association of malnutrition risk identified by the NRS￾2002 or the Royal Free Hospital-Nutritional Prioritizing
Tool with poor clinical parameters
No statistically significant difference in sex distribution was
shown between patients with low malnutrition risk and those
with moderate to high risk (online Supplementary Table S2).
The patients with low malnutrition risk according to the NRS￾2002 were older than those in the moderate- and high-risk group,
but there was no difference in the age distributions when the risk
of malnutrition was assessed by the RFH-NPT. Compared with
the low-risk group identified by the RFH-NPT, the levels of total
serum protein and albumin and the total lymphocyte count were
all significantly lower in the high-risk group; the same result was
not obtained when the risk of malnutrition was assessed with the
NRS-2002. Other clinical parameters were poor in patients with a
moderate to high risk of malnutrition defined both by the NRS￾2002 and RFH-NPT.
Royal Free Hospital-Nutritional Prioritizing Tool was
superior for the detection of the risk of malnutrition in
patients with cirrhosis
To determine the advantages of one assessment over the other,
we performed χ2 tests for detailed comparisons. A higher per￾centage of patients was identified as having moderate or high
malnutrition risk scores by the RFH-NPT (98/155 or 63 %) than
by the NRS-2002 (79/155 or 51 %; P = 0·001; Table 3). Patients
with cirrhosis were stratified into compensated and decompen￾sated groups, and nutritional risk was assessed in each group
with the NRS-2002 and RFH-NPT. The same results were
obtained with the NRS-2002 and RFH-NPT among compensated
patients (11/49 or 22·4 % v. 11/49 or 22·4 %, P = 1; online
Supplementary Table S3). However, the RFH-NPT identified
more patients at risk for malnutrition in the decompensated
group than the NRS-2002 (89/106 or 84 % v. 68/106 or 64 %,
P < 0·001; online Supplementary Table S4).
Royal Free Hospital-Nutritional Prioritizing Tool identified
the risk of malnutrition related to cirrhosis severity
We evaluated the relationship of the NRS-2002 and RFH-NPT
assessments with the severity of cirrhosis as defined by the
following: (1) Child–Pugh class, (2) MELD score, with or without,
(3) hepatic encephalopathy and (4) ascites. First, ability of the
RFH-NPT was not significantly different from that of the NRS￾2002 with regard to identifying patients with Child–Pugh class
A cirrhosis who were at moderate to high risk for malnutrition
(Table 4, P = 1), although there was a non-significant difference
between the two assessments in patients with Child–Pugh class B
cirrhosis (Table 4, 34/52 or 65·4 % v. 27/52 or 51·9 %, P = 0·065,
respectively). However, the RFH-NPT identified 22 % (13/59)
more Child–Pugh class C patients who were at risk for malnutri￾tion compared with the NRS-2002 (55/59 or 93·2 % v. 42/59 or
71·2 %, P = 0·002, Table 4). Second, the RFH-NPT, compared
with the NRS-2002, was better able to detect patients at moderate
and high risk for malnutrition (64/118 or 54·2 % v. 52/118 or
44·1 %, P = 0·012, Table 5) in the group of patients with MELD
scores <15. For patients with MELD scores >15, there was no sig￾nificant difference in the numbers of patients identified as being
at risk for malnutrition by the RFH-NPT and the NRS-2002. Third,
among patients with ascites, 27·8 % (20/72) were still categorised
as having a low risk of malnutrition by the NRS-2002, but none
was classified as having a low risk of malnutrition by the RFH￾NPT (online Supplementary Table S5). Finally, we evaluated
nutritional risk in patients with hepatic encephalopathy.

The RFH-NPT was better able to identify potential malnutrition in
patients without hepatic encephalopathy when compared with
the NRS-2002 (84/140 or 60 % v. 66/140 or 47·1 %, P = 0·001,

found between the two tools in patients with hepatic encepha￾lopathy (online Supplementary Table S6).

Kaplan–Meier curves were used to estimate the prognostic value
of each nutrition screening tool. The analysis was run from the
day after hospital admission to the date of death or a median of
1·5 years. The moderate to high risk of malnutrition identified by
the RFH-NPT was significantly associated with poor survival (Fig.
2, P = 0·019). Patients evaluated as having a moderate to high
risk of malnutrition by the NRS-2002 did not differ in survival
from those at low risk (Fig. 3, P = 0·50). Furthermore, we
assessed the predictive power of the two tools for patient mortal￾ity in subgroups of patients with compensated and decompen￾sated cirrhosis. No patients died in the compensated group in our
study. However, the RFH-NPT was better able than the NRS-2002
to detect the risk of malnutrition in living patients with decom￾pensated cirrhosis (55/70 or 78·6 % v. 45/70 or 64·3 %,
P = 0·031, online Supplementary Table S8). Among the patients
who died due to decompensation, 28 % (7/25) were misclassi￾fied as having a low risk of malnutrition by the NRS-2002 but
were deemed to be at moderate or high risk of malnutrition
by the RFH-NPT (21/25 or 84 % v. 14/25 or 56 %, P = 0·016;
online Supplementary Table S8). Multivariate Cox regression
analysis showed that the RFH-NPT but not the NRS-2002 was
an independent factor predicting the survival of cirrhosis
patients, with an OR of 2·041 (95 % CI 1·12, 3·73, P = 0·02)
(Table 6).

Discussion
The liver plays an important role in the metabolism of carbohy￾drates, proteins and fat(25,26)
. Dysfunction of the liver contributes
to malnutrition, which can develop occultly in the early stage of
chronic liver disease and can ultimately lead to protein-energy
malnutrition(6,7)
. The identification of patients at risk of malnutri￾tion in a hospital setting with an effective and simple nutrition
risk screening tool is essential; such a tool would enable earlier
nutrition assessment and more timely interventions, leading to
reductions in morbidity and mortality in patients with cirrhosis(6)
.
Previous European studies suggested that the RFH-NPT was
more sensitive than the NRS-2002 for the assessment of the risk
of malnutrition and the prediction of disease progression and
outcomes in patients with chronic liver disease based on regres￾sion analysis(11,12,16,17)
. Although the RFH-NPT is recommended
as a screening tool for malnutrition in liver disease patients, there
are few data from Asia. With a relatively large population of
patients with liver disease in China, we directly compared the
RFH-NPT and NRS-2002 with regard to the assessment of malnu￾trition in patients stratified by liver function, disease severity and
survival status. In Europe, alcohol consumption is the primary
cause of liver cirrhosis. A European study found that malnutrition
is more prevalent in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis than in
those with viral cirrhosis(17)
. The RFH-NPT specially takes
alcohol-related variables into consideration. Therefore, cirrhosis
patients tend to be predicted to have a higher risk of malnutrition
when the RFH-NPT is used than when general nutrition screen￾ing tools are used. However, many cases of liver cirrhosis in Asia
are caused by viral hepatitis, which does not require the evalu￾ation of alcohol consumption. We investigated whether the
RFH-NPT is still more effective than other scores for nutrition
screening in China. In addition, the NRS-2002 includes variables
of disease severity and complications. The NRS-2002 is consid￾ered helpful for identifying malnourished liver cirrhosis patients
with hepatocellular carcinoma(12)
. Our study excluded factors
such as hepatocellular carcinoma or uncontrolled co-morbid ill￾ness and made a direct and clear comparison of the scores in
patients whose nutritional risk status was primarily affected by
liver cirrhosis.
Our findings demonstrate that the RFH-NPT is more sensitive
than the NRS-2002 for the identification of patients at risk for
malnutrition in the early stage of liver disease. The overall prev￾alences of malnutrition obtained by the RFH-NPT and NRS-2002
were 63 % (98/155) and 51 % (79/155) in patients with cirrhosis,
respectively. Our study showed a similar prevalence of malnu￾trition to those reported in other studies, which varied from
55 to 70 % as assessed by the RFH-NPT(3) and from 31 to 45 %
as assessed by the NRS-2002(27,28)
.
Malnutrition is prevalent in all forms of liver disease, ranging
from 20 % in compensated liver disease to >80 % in patients with
decompensated liver disease(29–31)
. The presented results sug￾gested that the prevalence of malnutrition identified by the
RFH-NPT varied from 22·4 % in patients with compensated cir￾rhosis to 84·0 % in patients with decompensated cirrhosis; the
prevalences of malnutrition identified by the NRS-2002 were
22·4 and 64·2 % in patients with compensated and decompen￾sated cirrhosis, respectively. The high level of agreement with
regard to the prevalence of malnutrition in patients with com￾pensated cirrhosis supports the validity of the RFH-NPT.
Malnutrition in patients with cirrhosis usually contributes to
an increased rate of the development of ascites(32)
. The NRS￾2002, developed by Kondrup et al. and the European Society
for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism, was validated based on
a meta-analysis of 128 trials(15)
. Subsequent studies have sug￾gested that the ability and sensitivity of the NRS-2002 with regard
to the identification of patients at risk of malnutrition are highly
variable among disease populations and age groups(33)
. A high
false-negative rate of 36–38 % with the NRS-2002 was detected in
hospitalised patients(34)
, indicating that more than one-third of
patients at risk for malnutrition would be misclassified. As fluid
collections (ascites, peripheral oedema) conceal weight loss
occurring from muscle or fat loss, inaccurate weight and BMI
measurements result in the underestimation of the risk of malnu￾trition at the first screening of patients with cirrhosis, especially
decompensated cirrhosis, with the NRS-2002. The RFH-NPT was
validated against the RFH-GA as an easy and quick assessment in
a UK multicentre trial(13,35)
, only taking about 3 min to finish. It
takes into account objective symptoms and subjective feelings.
It is based on fluid overload, weight loss and oral intake and
eliminates the need assess muscle or fat loss and functional sta￾tus. Moreover, the RFH-NPT also takes into consideration sub￾clinical fluid retention. These findings contribute to RFH-NPT
having a better ability to identify the risk of malnutrition.
One study found the RFH-NPT to be a useful predictor of dis￾ease progression and outcome in patients with chronic liver
disease; the NRS-2002 was also found to be a successful predic￾tor of mortality based on nutritional risk status in patients with
liver cirrhosis(16)
. Another study showed that the risk of
malnutrition according to the RFH-NPT and not that assessed
with other methods tended to be associated with mortality(10)
.
Our study shows that the RFH-NPT is an independent predictive
factor for survival and is superior to the NRS-2002 for the predic￾tion of survival based on nutritional risk in liver cirrhosis patients.
Here, our results show that >28 % (7/28, online Supplementary
Table S7) more of the non-surviving patients with decompen￾sated cirrhosis were identified as being at risk of malnutrition
by the RFH-NPT than by the NRS-2002.
Several other tools that are available to predict the risk of mal￾nutrition were also assessed, such as the RFH-GA, MUST and
LDUST. A previous study showed that MUST scores were rela￾tively better correlated with the European Society for Clinical
Nutrition and Metabolism criteria for the definition of malnutri￾tion; however, the MUST is intended to be used as a general
nutritional risk screening tool and is not specific to liver
cirrhosis(12,36)
. The LDUST is a liver disease-specific tool(11)
.
The LDUST consists of a series of six patient-directed questions
covering the domains of nutrient intake, weight loss, subcutane￾ous fat loss, muscle mass loss, fluid accumulation and decline in
functional status to determine whether undernutrition is present
or absent. This tool may have limitations because it relies on the
patient’s subjective judgement of each of the measured param￾eters. Preliminary data suggest that the LDUST has a high positive
predictive but a low negative predictive value in patients
with cirrhosis, leading to the conclusion that it is a negative
screening tool is unable to reliably rule out undernutrition.
Nutrition risk screening tools in liver cirrhosis 1299
https://doi.org/10.1017/S0007114520002366 Published online by Cambridge University Press

When compared with the RFH-GA in our study, the LDUST had
the highest sensitivity and lowest specificity (69 and 10 %,
respectively), and the MUST had the lowest sensitivity
(38·6 %). In addition, the present study showed that the
RFH-NPT was better able than the LDUST to predict the risk
of malnutrition associated with increased mortality(17)
.
Therefore, we did not consider the LDUST and MUST in the sub￾sequent analyses, instead focusing on the NRS-2002, which is rel￾atively more widely used in clinical practice in China, and the
RFH-NPT. However, a higher quality controlled study should
be conducted in a large population of liver cirrhosis patients
to determine the best tool for the identification of nutritional risk.
The various conventional parameters, such as BMI, MAC and
TSF, reflect malnutrition and the severity of liver disease to a
certain extent(37)
, but they are insufficient for the evaluation of
the risk of malnutrition(3,25,38)
. BMI has been found to be inaccu￾rate in patients with ascites(39,40)
. The MAC and TSF have variable
results and have not been found to be strong predictors of
malnutrition(40,41)
. The serum level of albumin is a traditional
marker that is thought to reflect liver synthetic function rather
than nutritional status(42)
, and the use of the level of prealbumin
is controversial with regard to screening for patients at risk of
malnutrition and predicting mortality(43)
. It has been suggested
that the TLC decreases with increasing levels of malnutrition
and correlates with morbidity and mortality in hospitalised
patients(44)
. In our study, both the NRS-2002 and RFH-NPT were
related to disease severity.
Nutritional status is associated with disease deterioration. The
Child–Pugh class reflects the severity of liver disease. We inves￾tigated whether the RFH-NPT or the NRS-2002 was more sensi￾tive for the identification of the risk of malnutrition risk at a
relatively early stage of liver cirrhosis according to the Child–
Pugh class. The RFH-NPT and the NRS-2002 were equivalent
with regard to their ability to identify the risk of malnutrition
in patients with Child–Pugh class A liver cirrhosis. The
RFH-NPT identified a larger proportion of patients with Child–
Pugh class B liver cirrhosis as being at risk for malnutrition than
did the NRS-2002; however, the difference was NS, and the result
needs to be confirmed in a larger sample of patients. However,
the RFH-NPT identified 22 % (13/59) more patients with Child–
Pugh class C disease who were at risk of malnutrition than did the
NRS-2002. In practice, two simple criteria can be used immedi￾ately in patients at high risk of malnutrition, and one is having
advanced decompensated cirrhosis (Child–Pugh class C).
Patients with Child–Pugh class C disease are at very high risk
of malnutrition; these patients do not need to be screened for
malnutrition and instead can proceed directly to a nutritional
assessment.
Here, we found that the RFH-NPT is better able to identify the
risk of malnutrition (55/59 or 93·2 %) in patients with Child–Pugh
class C disease, confirming the abovementioned proposition.
The patients with Child–Pugh class B and C disease should
receive nutritional interventions as soon as possible before
any clinical sign of malnutrition is detectable, while patients with
Child–Pugh class A disease should undergo more rigorous
assessments to enable the provision of support in a timely
manner(34)
. Therefore, it is easy and quick for clinical staff to
use the RFH-NPT to identify patient who are at risk of
malnutrition instead of waiting for the evaluation of the Child–
Pugh class before performing a detailed nutrition assessment.
Sarcopenia is a syndrome characterised by skeletal muscle
loss that occurs with ageing, which is a major feature of
malnutrition, particularly in patients with less severe hepatic
dysfunction(45)
. Previous studies have noted that the impact of
sarcopenia was significant in patients with low MELD scores
(<15) but not in patients with high MELD scores (≥15)(46)
. Our
results suggest that the RFH-NPT is more sensitive than the
NRS-2002 for the identification of patients with a moderate
to high risk of malnutrition among those with a MELD
score <15.
Our study has limitations because it was performed with data
from a single centre. First, we enrolled a small amount of patients
in the evaluation of the sensitivity and specificity of the NRS-2002
and RFH-NPT, and therefore, more prospective studies are
required. However, the incorporation of anthropometric and
biochemical parameters reflecting different aspects of malnutri￾tion increased our ability to differentiate between these tools.
Second, some data were subjective assessments made by the
patients and clinical staff, leading to potential recall bias and
observer bias.
Conclusion
This prospective study evaluated the efficacy of screening for
nutritional risk with the RFH-NPT compared with the NRS￾2002 in patients with cirrhosis primarily caused by hepatitis virus
infection in China. The RFH-NPT was better able to predict the
risk of malnutrition in patients with cirrhosis and had a superior
prognostic value. Fewer patients at risk for malnutrition in the
early stage of cirrhosis were misclassified by the RFH-NPT; there￾fore, the RFH-NPT can aid in identifying patients who need nutri￾tional interventions in a timely manner to reduce complications.
Future studies are needed to test the prognostic power of the
RFH-NPT in larger populations.
