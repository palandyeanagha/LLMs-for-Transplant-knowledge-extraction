Ischemia causes kidney tubular cell damage and abnormal renal function. The kidney is capable of morpho￾logical restoration of tubules and recovery of function. Recently, it has been suggested that cells repopulating
the ischemically injured tubule derive from bone marrow stem cells. We studied kidney repair in chimeric mice
expressing GFPor bacterial β-gal orharboring the maleYchromosome exclusively inbone marrow-derived cells.
In GFP chimeras, some interstitial cells but not tubular cells expressed GFP after ischemic injury. More than
99% of those GFP interstitial cells were leukocytes. In female mice with male bone marrow, occasional tubular
cells (0.06%) appeared to be positive for the Y chromosome, but deconvolution microscopy revealed these to be
artifactual. In β-gal chimeras, some tubular cells also appeared to express β-gal as assessed by X-gal staining,
butfollowing suppression of endogenous (mammalian) β-gal, no tubular cells could be found that stained with
X-gal after ischemic injury. Whereas there was an absence of bone marrow–derived tubular cells, many tubular
cells expressed proliferating cell nuclear antigen, which is reflective of a high proliferative rate of endogenous
surviving tubular cells. Upon i.v. injection of bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells, postischemic functional
renal impairment was reduced, but there was no evidence of differentiation of these cells into tubular cells of
the kidney. Thus, our data indicate that bone marrow–derived cells do not make a significant contribution to
the restoration of epithelial integrity after an ischemic insult. It is likely that intrinsic tubular cell proliferation
accounts for functionally significant replenishment ofthe tubular epithelium after ischemia.
Introduction
Acute renal failure (ARF) is a common disease. Many disparate
etiologies, including various nephrotoxins, can lead to ARF via a
mechanism involving reduced total or segmental renal blood flow
with resultant ischemic injury. The mortality associated with this
syndrome is high and has not changed significantly overthe last 50
years. To date, there are few therapies of proven benefit in the treat￾ment of active disease or as prophylaxis(1).Ischemia causes changes
in tubular cell polarity; loss of integrity ofthe tubular epithelial bar￾rier, necrotic and apoptotic cell death; loss of both viable and nonvi￾able cells, which lift off the basement membrane; and expression of
genes characteristic ofthe embryonic kidney mesenchyme (1, 2).The
damaged kidney epithelium, however, in contrast to heart or brain,
can be completely restored in structure and function, although
repair often does not occur in a timely fashion in humans.
The kidney possesses a remarkable regenerative capacity after
acute ischemic and/or toxic injury. This regenerative capacity
manifests itself by proliferation and migration of poorly differ￾entiated cells along the denuded basement membrane of injured
tubular segments within a few days after ischemic insult (3). In
animal models of repair following ischemic injury, proliferation
is observed to be maximal in the straight segment of the proximal
tubule located in the outer medulla, where damage is most appar￾ent. The damaged areas of the nephron are repopulated initially
by poorly differentiated proliferating cells that have features of
epithelial precursors, such as a less well-developed brush border;
downregulation of the transcription factor kid-1 (4); and expres￾sion of the intermediate filament protein vimentin, which is nor￾mally undetectable in the adult proximal tubule epithelium but is
expressed in the embryonic metanephric mesenchyme (3). There
are several possibilities for the origin of these regenerating epithe￾lial cells: (a) epithelial cells may dedifferentiate, proliferate, then
redifferentiate into mature tubular cells, as a survival response
to injury; (b) bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) may home to the
injured epithelium, where local cues trigger differentiation; or
(c) a population of renal mesenchymal stem cells exists that may
replenish the epithelial cell population after injury.
In addition to tubular cell injury, the peritubular vasculature
undergoes changes in response to ischemia. These changes range
from activation of inflammatory genes, cell swelling, and disrup￾tion of endothelial junctions to detachment of live and dead cells
from the basement membrane (5). These endothelial changes,

together with persistent, inappropriate vasoconstriction, lead to
reduction of peritubular blood flow, which contributes to exten￾sion of the initial ischemic insult (6). Although replacement of the
lost tubular cells is essential for nephron regeneration, the return
of blood flow, which is dependent upon endothelial cell integrity,
is also essential for recovery.
Recently there have been reports of far more plasticity than pre￾viously believed in the differentiated state of many different adult
cell types. Adult BMSCs, both mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs)
and HSCs, have been reported to have the capacity to differenti￾ate into or fuse with organ-specific cell types (7–12). In 1 study in
hepatic tissues, it was concluded that these cells can play an impor￾tant role in regeneration and repair (13). Several studies claim a
role for adult BMSCsin repopulation of tubules of the injured kid￾ney (14–16). One study identified these cells as HSCs(15), another
as MSCs (17). Given the poor prognosis of ARF, the promise of
stem cell therapy to aid regeneration and organ recovery seems a
very attractive approach to disease management.
Using 3 different markers of bone marrow–derived cells in chi￾meric mice, we now report that following induction of ischemic
injury in the mouse, when large numbers of new tubular cells are
produced, BMSCs do not localize in the tubules. This indicates
that repair of the tubule is a property intrinsic to the kidney itself.
Identification of bone marrow markersin the interstitium, howev￾er, isindicative of a bone marrow cell origin of not only leukocytes
but also a small number of cells lacking the leukocyte common
antigen and expressing markers of endothelial cells.
Results
Ischemic injury results in severe tubular damage followed by repair. Kid￾ney ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) results in disruption of the actin
cytoskeleton in damaged tubular cells, which is reversible if the
cellsurvivesthe insult (3). The actin cytoskeleton wasidentified by
staining with phalloidin conjugated to the cyanine dye Cy3 (phal￾loidin-Cy3). Two daysfollowing unilateral ischemia, there wasloss
of the brush border of proximal tubular cells of the S3 segment in
the postischemic kidney but not in the contralateral control kid￾ney (Figure 1A). Extensive loss of epithelial cells could be seen in
some tubules after ischemia. Seven days following injury, many
of the tubules had recovered an apical actin cytoskeletal staining
pattern, indicative of restoration of the brush border, and 3 weeks
following I/R injury, the lost tubular cells had been almost com￾pletely replaced by new cells (Figure 1A).
I/Rinjury resulted in characteristic necrotic and apoptotic chang￾esin the tubules ofthe outer medulla,followed by intense prolifera￾tion and recovery oftubularintegrity (Figure 1B)(3, 18).In addition

to identifying mitotic nuclei, we stained sections for nuclei
expressing the protein proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA),
in order to label and quantify proliferating cells (Figure 1C).
Tubular cell proliferation was greatly increased (63.7% ± 4.7%
PCNA-positive nuclei) in the outer medulla of the recovering kid￾ney compared with the sham-operated control kidney (0 hours)
(Figure 1D). Tubular cell proliferation also remained elevated
(8.1% ± 1.3%) at 7 days. Bilateral ischemic injury resulted in a rise
in plasma creatinine levels from baseline of 0.1 mg/dl to a peak of
1.7 mg/dl at 48 hours (n = 4 per time point), followed by complete
recovery to baseline at 7 days (Figure 1E).
Enhanced GFP is not detected in tubular cells of enhanced GFP chimeric 
mice following I/R injury. We generated chimeric mice with donor
bone marrow expressing enhanced GFP (EGFP). In the donor,
the EGFP gene was driven by the chicken β-actin promoter and
was expressed in all tubular cells (19). I/R injury was induced in
male mice 6 weeks following bone marrow transplantation. Bone
marrow cells and buffy coat leukocytes in the recipients were
analyzed by flow cytometry and compared with cells from the
donor mice (Figure 2A). The proportion of bone marrow cells of
recipients with increased fluorescence from EGFP (57.6% ± 3.1%;
n = 12) was comparable to that of donor mice bone marrow
cell expression (59.6% ± 4.2%; n = 3). The proportion of total
blood leukocytes with EGFP fluorescence was somewhat high￾er in both chimeras and donor mice (73.5% ± 3.5%, n = 12; and
77.4% ± 4.7%, n = 3, respectively). The fact that the number of
fluorescent cells in bone marrow was not an even higher per￾centage of total cells likely reflects the previously reported lack
of expression of EGFP in cells of the erythroid lineage (19).
Myeloid leukocytes (77.7% ± 3.3%) and circulating lymphocytes
(74.0% ± 2.5%) in the chimeras also expressed EGFP, which
confirmed that chimerism was not restricted to 1 leukocyte lin￾eage (Figure 2B). In addition, when tissue sections of spleen and
thymus from the chimeric mice were analyzed, nearly all cells
expressed EGFP (Figure 2C). These data indicate that multipo￾tent hematopoietic stem cell progenitors were transplanted and
engrafted into the bone marrow.
In an attempt to detect cells within the tubule that expressed
EGFP in these chimeric mice, we examined sections from the
ipsilateral and contralateral kidneys of mice at 2 days (n = 4) and 7
days(n = 4) afterischemia at high power(magnification, ×400). We
found no examples of tubular cells expressing EGFP at these time
points (Figure 3). By contrast, analysis of kidney sections from
donor EGFP mice confirmed that tubular cells strongly expressed
EGFP (Figure 3C), and, therefore, tubular cells in the chimeric
mice would be expected to be clearly visible if they were derived
from BMSCs from the donor mouse.
Following I/R injury, EGFP is detected in peritubular cells coexpress￾ing leukocyte markers and a small population of cells lacking CD45 
and expressing endothelial markers. The postischemic kidneys of
EGFP chimeras had an increased number of fluorescent cells
(Figure 3B). In order to determine the phenotype of these cells,
we immunolabeled tissue sections for leukocyte markers (B220,
CD11b, and CD45) and markers of endothelial cells (vWF and
CD31), then examined them by confocal microscopy. Not sur￾prisingly, most EGFP-positive cells stained positively for leu￾kocyte markers. Nevertheless, small numbers of EGFP-posi￾tive cells (0.5% ± 0.6%) did not express the leukocyte common
antigen CD45 (Figure 4A) 7 days following I/R injury. In areas,
particularly in the outer medulla, where extensive tubule repair
had occurred by 7 days following I/R injury, some EGFP cells
also expressed CD31, a marker of endothelial cells (Figure 4B).

We examined sections by confocal microscopy to confirm colocal￾ization (Figure 4B). In sections examined by confocal microsco￾py, vWF, another marker of endothelial cells, was also found to be
coexpressed in a small subset of EGFP-positive cells (Figure 4C).
EGFP-positive endothelial cells were found only in peritubular
capillaries. Neither capillary loops of glomeruli nor arterioles
showed any evidence for EGFP positivity. Importantly, in the
contralateral kidneys, very few endothelial cells expressing EGFP
could be seen (data not shown). In order to determine the pro￾portion of endothelial cells expressing EGFP, serial high-power
fields (HPFs) in the cortex were scored for green fluorescent
cells that also expressed either vWF or CD31 (Figure 4, B and C).
As quantitated in Figure 4D, 0.3% ± 0.3% of endothelial cells
in contralateral kidneys and 1.6% ± 0.4% in 7-day postischemic
kidneys coexpressed vWF and EGFP. Similar observations were
made for CD31-positive cells (Figure 4D). Together, these data
suggest that endothelial cell replacement by BMSCs or fusion
with bone marrow–derived cells occurs at a low level in response
to the vascular injury resulting from ischemia. Sections were also
labeled with the fibroblast marker α-SMA. Despite an expanded
population of α-SMA–positive cells, we found no evidence by
confocal microscopy for EGFP-expressing fibroblasts in post￾ischemic kidneys (data not shown).
The Y chromosome is found in postischemic kidney peritubular but not 
tubular cells in sex-mismatched chimeras when assessed by deconvolution 
microscopy. Female mice with marrow transplants from male mice
were subjected to bilateral and unilateral ischemic injury. At both
7 and 15 days after injury, in situ hybridization was used to assess
harvested tissue forthe presence of Y chromosome–bearing cells.As
expected,the majority of cellsin the spleen (Figure 5B) and thymus
(data not shown) had a nuclear Y chromosome, which confirmed
chimerism. In male postischemic kidneys, the Y chromosome
was clearly visible by epifluorescent microscopy in 57.6% ± 6.9%
of tubular cells (data not shown).
Postischemic kidneys from 13 chimeric mice were analyzed at
days 7 and 15 by in situ hybridization. In each case, chimerism

was confirmed by simultaneous assessment of hematopoietic
organs (Figure 5B). To enhance proximal tubular staining, we
also counterstained sections with lotus lectin (Figure 5A). We
observed occasional Y chromosome–positive tubular cells in
the contralateral, sham-operated, and postischemic kidneys by
epifluorescence. The frequency of positive tubular cells in the
15-day postischemic kidneys was 3.54 ± 0.59 per 40 HPFs. The
frequency was also measured as a percentage of all tubular cells
and found to be 0.06% ± 0.01%. This frequency was no different
from that of positive tubular cells seen in sham-operated and
contralateral kidneys and in kidneys from nonchimeric female
mice. The same sections were scrutinized further by deconvolu￾tion microscopy. This provided not only exceptional 3D detail
of the apparently positive tubular cells, but also a 3D compos￾ite for detailed analysis of overlying cells and enhanced ability
to determine whether the Y chromosome was within the con￾fines of the nucleus (Figure 5, C and D). We examined 16 appar￾ently positive tubular cells in postischemic kidneys of chimeric
mice and 5 kidneys from female, nonchimeric mice. In all but
1 case, the positive tubular cell was clearly an artifact, due to a
rare overlying leukocyte or intratubular monocyte or, most fre￾quently, nonspecific aggregates of fluorescent probe (Figure 5,
C and D). In the 1 example where tubular cell labeling could
not be excluded, it was unclear whether this was a leukocyte or
a tubular cell. In the 15-day postischemic kidneys, there was
only approximately a 2-fold increase in the level of interstitial
leukocytes compared with controls. Since the apparently posi￾tive tubule cells were artifacts, sometimes due to leukocytes,
one might have expected an increase in the frequency of arti￾fact in postischemic kidneys. However, at such a low frequency,
at a time when there was only a 2-fold increase in the level of
interstitial leukocytes, this small increase in leukocyte levels was
not reflected by an apparent increase in Y chromosome–positive
tubular cells in 15-day postischemic compared with sham-oper￾ated or contralateral kidneys.
To determine in these chimeras whether any peritubular cells
of bone marrow origin might be peritubular endothelial cells, we
counterstained hybridized sections with the endothelial mark￾er vWF. As was found in the GFP chimeras, small numbers of
endothelial cells had the Y chromosome (Figure 5E). These results
were confirmed by deconvolution microscopy (Figure 5F).
Bacterial β-gal is not detected in tubular cells of β-gal chimeras following 
I/R injury. Priorstudies assessing the contribution of bone marrow
derived cells to I/R injury and repair have reported high levels of
engraftment into tubule cells when β-gal–expressing bone marrow
cells were used (15, 16). Using a similar approach, we tested the
I/R model at 6 weeks after bone marrow transplantation. We con￾firmed chimerism of irradiated mice transfused with bone mar￾row from mice expressing the LacZ gene by staining buffy coat leu￾kocytes with X-gal. Nearly all (91% ± 7%) leukocytes stained blue
compared with 0% ± 0% of wild-type C57BL/6J blood leukocytes.
In addition, when kidneys were harvested for analysis, bone mar￾row was also stained with X-gal and was found to be nearly com￾pletely reconstituted with X-gal–stained cells (Figure 6, A and B).
Tissue sections of hematopoietic organs,spleen, and thymus(n = 5
per time point) from the chimeric mice also exhibited widespread
positive staining with X-gal, which confirmed chimerism in the
organs of the mice, as did peritoneal macrophages and lung alveo￾lar macrophages(Figure 6C). For example, upon analysis of HPFs,
94% ± 8% of peritoneal cells (Figure 6C) and 79% ± 15% of spleen
cells from chimeric mice (n = 10) stained blue with X-gal, whereas
0% ± 0% of peritoneal cells and 0% ± 0% of spleen cells from wild￾type C57BL/6J animals stained blue with X-gal (data not shown).
X-gal staining was elevated in ipsilateral and contralateral kid￾neys of mice at 2, 7 (n = 9), and 21 days (n = 5) following unilateral
I/R injury induced 6 weeks after bone marrow transplantation.
Viewing HPFs (magnification, ×400), we detected X-gal staining
in a small number of tubular cells. These X-gal–positive tubules
colabeled with the proximal tubular cell marker gp330 (Figure 7A).
This degree ofstaining, however, did not differ markedly from that
seen in the contralateral kidneys and represented far fewer cells
(Figure 7B) than would be expected based on the percentage of
PCNA-positive cells (Figure 1C).
Given that the kidney expresses endogenous β-gal (20, 21), the
staining in chimeric micewas compared toX-galstaining in kidney

sections from nonchimeric wild-type C57BL/6J mice after unilat￾eral I/R injury. Sections taken from these nonchimeric mice also
had small numbers of tubular cells that stained blue with X-gal
solution prepared as described in Methods (Figure 7B). These
data suggested that X-gal staining in chimeras might be detect￾ing endogenous β-gal activity. Frozen sections from 48-hour and
7-day postischemic tissue were immunolabeled with antibacte￾rial β-gal antibody. By this method, spleen cells labeled strongly
for β-gal in chimeric mice (Figure 7C), but the antibody did not
detect β-gal in the postischemic tubular cells (Figure 7C). To
clarify further whether the β-gal activity detected by X-gal stain￾ing was endogenous or bacterial, we used a commercially pro￾duced β-gal staining set (Roche Diagnostics Corp.) designed to
minimize staining from mammalian β-gal. With these reagents,
bone marrow, spleen (Figure 7D), and thymic tissue in chimeric
mice stained to a level equal to that seen when the X-gal solution
prepared in our laboratory was used as a positive control. By con￾trast, however, when this commercial X-gal solution was used,
tubular cells did not stain for β-gal either following I/R injury
or in contralateral kidneys in chimeric mice (Figure 7D). Care￾ful review of all the ipsilateral and contralateral kidney sections
from chimeric mice, taken 2, 7, and 21 days after ischemia, that
were stained by this method revealed only 1 positive tubular cell
in a contralateral kidney. Tubular cells did not stain positively
for β-gal in control C57BL/6J mice (data not shown).
What might account for occasional positive staining with one
X-gal solution and not another? A reduction in pH of the X-gal
staining solution has been reported to result in staining of the
mammalian form of β-gal (21). Using the commercial X-gal solu￾tion, which has a pH of 7.5, we evaluated whether tubules of post￾ischemic nonchimeric mice were more likely to stain positively
if we lowered the pH. When pH was lowered to 6.5, we could
detect positively stained tubular cells in wild-type C57BL/6J
kidney sections (but not spleen sections; Figure 7D). Therefore,
when X-gal staining solution has a pH less than 7.5, there is sig￾nificant staining of endogenous β-gal activity in kidney sections.
Careful adjustment of pH can minimize this unwanted staining.
These findings are exemplified by the staining of 0.2-mm tissue
sections of normal wild-type C57BL/6J kidneys that had been
perfusion-fixed with PLP (2% paraformaldehyde [PFA], 75 mM
l-lysine, and 10 mM sodium periodate) (Figure 7E). The com￾mercial staining set (pH 7.5; Roche Diagnostics Corp.) detected
a minimal level of endogenous β-gal. Much stronger detection
was seen when the pH was reduced to 6.5. These images indicate
that endogenous β-gal was detected in the kidney tubule at pH
6.5. When detection in thick tissue sections (0.2 mm) was mini￾mized (at pH 7.5), tubule staining was attenuated but could still
be seen faintly in the outer medulla, precisely the segment of
nephron most susceptible to injury from ischemia (Figure 7E).
Thick tissue sections (0.2 mm) of wild-type C57BL/6J kidneys 2
days after ischemia, stained at pH 7.5, also showed a weak dif￾fuse cortical staining pattern, and at pH 6.5, there was much
stronger staining in cortical tubules (data not shown). Note that
kidney sections from donor LacZ mice had strong kidney tubule
staining with X-gal at pH 7.5 (Figure 7F).
After I/R injury, the LacZ chimeric mouse kidneys did not show
evidence for endothelial cell replacement, although there were
positively stained leukocytes in the interstitium. We reviewed tis￾sue sectionsfrom the LacZ donor mice and found that endothelial
cells did notstain with the X-galsolution, which suggeststhat bac￾terial β-gal was only weakly expressed in the endothelium. Bone
marrow–derived endothelial cells would therefore not be expected
to be identified in this chimeric mouse.
Intravenous therapy for I/R injury with bone marrow MSCs ame￾liorates injury without differentiation into renal structures. Although
our data indicated that bone marrow stem cells make only a
minor direct contribution to replenishment of postischemic
renal structures, we wondered whether direct infusion of bone
marrow–derived MSCs might promote stem cell differentiation
into renal structures, in particular endothelial cells. Bone mar￾row MSCs have multipotentiality, as evidenced by their ability
to differentiate into a variety of mesenchymal cell types (22). We
purified MSCs from EGFP mice (23). These cells did not express
lineage markers, or c-kit, but expressed CD34 and Sca-1 when
assessed by flow cytometry (Figure 8A). Importantly, in addi￾tion to c-kit (which is expressed by endothelial cells), they did
not express other endothelial cell markers, including CD31. The
MSCs were highly fluorescent with EGFP and could be induced

in vitro to differentiate into endothelial-like structures and adi￾pocytes (Figure 8, B and C), which confirmed the multilineage
potential of the MSCs. In the case of endothelial-like structures,
these labeled strongly with anti-CD31 antibody (Figure 8B). As
quantitated by flow cytometry, 1.8% ± 0.5% of MSCs exhibited
a 100- to 1,000-fold increase in expression of CD31 when cul￾tured on Matrigel (data not shown), which provides further evi￾dence that MSCs have the capacity to develop an endothelial
phenotype. MSCs were cultured on tissue culture grade plastic.
Mice were subjected to bilateral I/R injury, followed by i.v. injec￾tions of MSCs (0.5 × 106 cells per injection) immediately after
surgery and at 24 hours after ischemia. In our initial studies,
peak plasma creatinine levels at 24 hours were no different in
mice receiving MSCs or an injection of control medium (PBS)
(Figure 8E). Organs examined by fluorescent microscopy at 24
and 48 hours provided no evidence for implantation of MSCs.
The experiments were repeated using MSCs that had been cul￾tured on Matrigel. A control cell type, embryonic fibroblasts, was
prepared identically. Injection of MSCs reduced the severity of
ARF as measured by the creatinine level at 24 hours (Figure 8E).
This effect was, however, also seen when embryonic fibroblasts,
grown on Matrigel, were injected (Figure 8F). We examined these
kidneys by fluorescence microscopy 24 hours, 48 hours, 7 days,
and 15 days after I/R injury. There was no evidence of MSCs in
the kidney parenchyma. We did not find 1 example of EGFP￾expressing cells in any of these kidneys. Furthermore, we exam￾ined other organs, in particular lung and spleen, where there was
also no evidence for MSCs implantation. Analysis of bone mar￾row at 15 days by flow cytometry revealed a small population of
EGFP-fluorescent cells (less than 1%), which suggests that MSCs
had homed to the marrow cavities.
We further explored the potential of MSCs to become renal
structures by direct intrarenal parenchymal injection of MSCsfol￾lowing ischemic injury. Two hours following injection of MSCs
(0.5 × 106) into the cortex of the normal or postischemic kidney,
viable MSCs could be identified by microscopy (Figure 8D). How￾ever, 24 hours later, there was no evidence of EGFP cells in the
kidney. These results are comparable to those of an earlierstudy, in

which the fate of MSCs was traced in irradiated mice (22). In this
study, MSCs homed to the bone marrow only. Our data indicate
that, while an injection of cells i.v. can have a therapeutic effect
on the course of functional impairment due to I/R when cells are
grown under specific conditions, this effect is independent of
implantation and differentiation into renal structures.
Hematopoietic lineage–negative leukocytes. Althoughwe found no evi￾dence for differentiation of bone marrow–derived cells into tubu￾lar cells, we did find evidence for differentiation into endothelial
cells in the injured kidney. It was important therefore to determine
whether renal injury mobilized stem cellsfrom the bone marrow to
the blood, as has been suggested in otherreports(15, 24). Bone mar￾row–derived HSCs and MSCslack lineage markers, but the identity
of cell surface markers of endothelial precursors remains ambigu￾ous.In some studies, endothelial precursors have also been shown to
lack lineage markers(24, 25).Blood leukocytes purified from healthy
mice or mice 24 and 48 hoursfollowing ischemic injurywere labeled
with antibodies to lineage markers and analyzed by flow cytometry
(Figure 9). In healthy mice, a small population of leukocytes (less
than 1%) was hematopoietic lineage–negative (lin–). We found no
evidence for an increase in this negative population at 24 hours
(data notshown) or at 48 hours(Figure 9) following injury.
Discussion
Our studies focused on the importance of BMSCs in a model of
severe ischemic injury of the kidney, which is characterized by
organ failure with subsequent recovery. In this model, many tubu￾lar cells of the outer medulla die by necrosis and apoptosis (26),
and in surviving cells, there is widespread cytoskeletal disruption.
Injury is followed by cytoskeletal reorganization and intense tubu￾lar cell proliferation during the recovery phase. We used 3 different
reportersto identify bone marrow–derived cellsto evaluatewhether
these cells contribute directly to the repair of the epithelium after
injury. The use of 1 reporter, EGFP, provided no evidence for direct
BMSC involvementin tubular cellregeneration. Bone marrow cells
did, however, make a small contribution to repopulation of the
injured vascular endothelium and could indirectly affect tubule
regeneration. These results were supported by examination of
sex-mismatched chimeras. There was a low level of false positive
results when in situ hybridization was used to detect the Y chro￾mosome. This false positivity was eliminated when deconvolution
microscopy was used to define better the 3D tissue relationship of
tubule cellsto leukocytes and otherinterstitial cells(27). The use of
another reporter, β-gal, suggested a small contribution from bone
marrow–derived cells to tubular cell replacement. Closer examina￾Figure 8

tion of this reporter model indicated that endogenous β-gal in the
tubular cells of the inflamed postischemic kidney could account
for all of the β-gal–positive tubular cells.
Our I/R model resulted in disruption of the actin cytoskeleton
in most of the intact tubular cells in the outer stripe of the outer
medulla 48 hours afterischemia asreflected by phalloidin staining
(18). Three weeks afterischemia, the disrupted tubules had almost
completely returned to normal. We and others have demonstrated
that spreading, dedifferentiation, and then proliferation of viable
cells occur during recovery from renal I/R injury (3). In our previ￾ous study (3) and our current study, tubular cell proliferation was
demonstrated to be prominent. In the absence of BMSCs differen￾tiating into tubular cells, it is probable that regenerating tubular
cells derive from dedifferentiated cells of tubular origin that have
survived the initial ischemic insult, divide, and are able to redif￾ferentiate into the mature tubular cell phenotype.
Recent reports suggest that there is significant plasticity in
the developmental potential of many different adult cell types,
although adult stem cells appear to be more limited than their
embryonic counterparts in proliferative capacity and pluripoten￾tiality (8, 28). Recently, some studies have provided evidence that
adult bone marrow cells can give rise to or fuse with cells outside
their tissue of origin, including heart, brain, and liver (29–31).
Several reports also indicate that cells of bone marrow origin can
become functioning endothelial cells and that this population
is important in revascularization following injury (32–37). Our
findings are consistent with such observations on the endothe￾lium and focus attention on the renal vasculature as an important
site for repair. Although frequently overlooked, evidence for the
importance of vascular repair in the injured kidney was provided
in recent studies in which direct administration of endothelial
cells into postischemic kidney circulation was reported to hasten
recovery (37, 38) and longer-term studies showing that the post￾ischemic kidney is characterized by loss of capillaries in the outer
medulla that are not fully regenerated (39). Bone marrow–derived
endothelial cells may possess a greater capacity to proliferate and
as such are likely important contributors to vascular recovery
from injury (40). The fact that many fewer endothelial cells in
contralateral kidneys are replaced by cells originating from the
bone marrow suggeststhat bone marrow cell differentiation in the
mouse kidney contributes more to replenishing the endothelial
cells lost due to injury than to the replenishing of endothelial
cells during normal cell turnover. Compared with the contribu￾tion of bone marrow–derived endothelial cells to vascularization
of other organs including hind limb and tumorigenesis (34, 41),
the contribution of bone marrow cells to revascularization in our
model of kidney repair appears only to be minor, and it is unlike￾ly, therefore, that bone marrow cells contribute significantly to
regeneration. Whether this finding reflects impaired revascular￾ization in the regenerating kidney, as has been suggested in other
studies (39), remains to be explored.
Previous investigation of the role of BMSCs in the injured kid￾ney has focused on tubular cell regeneration. Bone marrow cells
have been reported to contribute to both normal turnover of
renal epithelium in mice (5% of tubular cells after 13 weeks of
chimerism) and regeneration in human renal transplantation
(up to 6.8% after 3 months) (14). These provocative observa￾tions have been pursued by others who suggest in 1 study that,
7 days following ischemic injury, 20% of all tubules in the outer
medulla are replaced by bone marrow–derived cells (15, 16).
In another study of mild ischemic injury, which was not com￾pletely characterized, 80% of all tubules were reported to con￾tain differentiated tubular cells of bone marrow origin only 24
hours following ischemia (16). Both these studies, which were
performed in the same mouse strain we used, relied heavily on
staining for β-gal activity with X-gal. Furthermore, in 1 report,
replacement with bone marrow cells appeared to occur at a time
when cell death and cell sloughing predominate (16). It is our
contention that the tubular cell β-gal staining reported previ￾ously may reflect endogenous β-gal. Our study indicates that
native mouse kidney tubules have high levels of endogenous
β-gal, which, following mild fixation, stains strongly with X-gal
if the pH is lower than 7.5. Even at high pH, after mild fixa￾tion of thick (0.2 mm) sections, endogenous β-gal activity can
be detected weakly in the outer medulla of normal kidneys and
diffusely in the cortex in postischemic kidneys. It is possible,
therefore, that endogenous β-gal is more easily stained in the
postischemic kidney, and this staining can easily be interpreted
as bacterial β-gal activity derived from donor cells in this model.
When we minimized detection of endogenous but not bacterial
β-gal activity, tubular epithelial cells in 5-µm sections did not
exhibit β-gal activity. Furthermore, bacterial β-gal–specific anti￾body did not locate antigen in tubular cells. In our opinion, the
LacZ chimeric mouse expressing bacterial β-gal in bone marrow
cells is an unreliable model for tracking bone marrow–derived
cells in the adult kidney. When we used sex-mismatched chi￾meras to identify cells of bone marrow origin, we found very
small numbers of tubular cell nuclei that stained for the Y chro￾mosome. The same few apparently positive cells were analyzed
by deconvolution microscopy. When this technique was used,
it became apparent that aggregates of fluorescent probe were

located outside of the nucleus, which indicates that these cells
did not have true nuclear Y chromosome positivity. Recently, in a
detailed study of epithelial cells in enteric human biopsies from
human sex-mismatched bone marrow transplants, it was point￾ed out that conventional microscopy markedly overestimated
the number of bone marrow–derived epithelial cells (27). There￾fore, detailed 3D microscopy of tissue is required for definitive
scoring of Y chromosome–positive nuclei. Because tissues from
EGFP chimeric mice require no fixation and mice do not endog￾enously express GFP, we have found the EGFP chimeric model
to give superior results, with greater sensitivity and specificity
over other approaches. In addition, colocalization studies can
be performed using 1-step antibody procedures on these tissues,
which further enhances the specificity of findings.
The precise phenotype of BMSC precursors that differentiate
into endothelial cells is currently unclear. Contrasting reports
showthat bone marrowstromal cells, c-kit+ BMSCs, lin–c-Kit+Sca1+
BMSCs, or monocytes have the potential to become endothelial
cells (42–45). Nevertheless, bone marrow stromal cells have been
reported to differentiate into endothelial cells in vitro and assist
in tumor vascularization in vivo (44). We therefore injected bone
marrow stromal cells i.v. and found that they did not home to
the injured kidney, even following differentiation into capillary
structures in vitro. Interestingly, they could not be found in other
organs(lung, heart,spleen, liver) 2 weeks afterinjection, butsmall
numbers homed to the bone marrow, which was in keeping with
previous observations (46). Although MSCs did not differenti￾ate into renal structures in vivo, they had the capacity to reduce
the severity of ARF following I/R injury. This protective capacity
was not restricted to MSCs, since fibroblasts grown under identi￾cal conditions had the same efficacy. By contrast, MSCs grown
on plastic had no such protective effect. Further work will be
required to determine the cause of this protective effect. Some
possibilities include cytokine release by injected cells, inadver￾tent injection of cell substrate, the release of antiinflammatory
cytokines such as IL-10 following apoptotic cell death of injected
cells, or the immunomodulatory effects of clearance of circulat￾ing cells by splenic phagocytes (47, 48).
Although we were unable to positively identify MSCs as the
stem cells responsible for replacement of endothelial cells in
the postischemic kidney, it remains possible that HSCs were
mobilized from the bone marrow, as reported by others, or that
they derive from a subset of circulating monocytes (15, 16). We
searched carefully for an increased population of circulating leu￾kocytes lacking lineage markers CD11b, GR-1, CD4, CD8, B220,
Ter-119 at 24 and 48 hours following induction of injury in our
model. We have failed repeatedly to see a mobilized, distinctly
lin– population of circulating leukocytes. Although there is no
mobilized population of lin– cells in the circulation, up to 1% of
peripheral leukocytes are lin– in both healthy and diseased mice
and therefore represent a large enough pool to account for the
cell replacement we have observed.
Recently, controversy over the importance of BMSCs in solid
organ repair has been generated by findings that cardiomyocyte
replacement following infarction and pancreas β cell regeneration
can both proceed without the involvement of stem cells (49–51).
Ourfindingsin the kidney reinforce our hypothesisthatthe tubule
has an enormous capacity to repair itself as a result of dedifferen￾tiation of proximal tubule epithelial cells followed by prolifera￾tion and reestablishment of a differentiated phenotype (52). Our
findings that bone marrow–derived cells can differentiate into
kidney endothelial cells or fuse with these cells suggests that the
recovering kidney may benefit from circulating endothelial cell
precursors. In the injured pancreas, liver, and heart, studies point
to progressive replacement with BMSC-derived endothelial cells
over a number of weeks (32, 53). It is possible therefore that fur￾therrepair of peritubular capillaries by BMSCsin the postischemic
kidney occurs in ensuing weeks.
Our studies do not definitively exclude a role for kidney￾derived mesenchymal stem cells in repopulation of the ischemi￾cally injured renal tubule. The identification of a population of
cells within the kidney that has the capacity to differentiate into
tubular cells has remained elusive (54), although there is a recent
report of multipotent stem cells in the renal papilla (55). In our
studies, very early after injury, a large number of proliferating
cells could be seen at diverse sites in the regenerating tubules. In
order for large numbers of proliferating cells to be derived from
endogenous kidney stem cells, a large population of stem cells
would have to be present and adjacent to or within proximal
tubules, and the intrinsic low proliferation rate of such stem cells
would have to be enhanced dramatically. Our findings that bone
marrow–derived cells differentiate into or fuse with peritubular
vascular endothelial cells suggests possible therapeutic strategies
focused on enhancing this process.
We conclude that bone marrow–derived cells do not make a
significant contribution to the restoration of epithelial integ￾rity after an ischemic insult and that epithelial cells that restore
tubular integrity in the postischemic kidney primarily originate
in resident surviving epithelial cells that undergo a phenotypic
transition resulting in dedifferentiation, proliferation, and subse￾quent differentiation of the parent and daughter cellsinto mature
polar epithelial cells. It is hoped that understanding the factors
regulating this behavior of the kidney epithelial cell will lead to
insight into therapeutic approachesto activate and potentiate this
response in patients where it seems to be impaired.
Methods
Chimeric mice. Bacterial β-gal–transgenic mice expressing the LacZ gene
(B6.129S7-Gtrosa26), EGFP [C57BL/6-TgN(ACTbEGFP)10sb] mice, and
wild-type C57BL/6J mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory.
Wild-type isogenic recipient mice (aged 8–12 weeks) were lethally irradiat￾ed using 137Csirradiator(single dose of 1,000 rads over 30 minutes). Whole
bone marrow was collected from limb bones of male C57BL/6J, β-gal–, and
EGFP-transgenic mice. Ten million cellsin 200 µl of PBS were injected into
the lateral tail vein ofrecipients 2 hourslater, in accordance with a protocol
approved by the Harvard Center for Animal Resources and Comparative
Medicine. Recipients were housed in sterile conditions, and chimerism was
confirmed at 5 weeks by either flow cytometry (GFP chimeras) or X-gal
staining (LacZ chimeras) of buffy coat cells.
I/R injury models. Six weeks following bone marrow injections (see
above), mice (β-gal, n = 9 per group; EGFP, n = 4 per group; sex mis￾matched, n = 4 per group) were anesthetized with pentobarbital (65 µg/g
body weight) and subjected to 30 minutes (male) or 45 minutes (female)
of left unilateral kidney ischemia. Male mice are more susceptible to
injury than females, and these time differences give equivalent func￾tional injury (56). The contralateral kidney was exposed to sham surgery.
Kidneys were exposed through flank incisions. Ischemia was induced by
clamping of renal pedicles with nontraumatic microaneurysm clamps
(Roboz Surgical Instruments Co.). The incisions were temporarily closed
during ischemia or sham surgery and body temperature maintained at

36.5–37.3°C. After the clamps were removed, reperfusion of the kidneys
was confirmed visually. Mice were hydrated with 1-ml aliquots of saline
administered i.p. Kidneys were harvested 2, 7, 15, or 21 days after the
surgery. In all cases, tissues were flushed, via intracardiac catheter, with
ice-cold PBS or fixative to remove blood-borne leukocytes and erythro￾cytes. In addition, bone marrow, blood leukocytes, peritoneal leukocytes,
spleen, thymus, and lung were also harvested for analysis. In wild-type
nonchimeric (C57BL/6J) mice (n = 4 per group), unilateral ischemia was
also performed in a manner identical to that described above. In sex￾mismatched chimeric (n = 4 per group) and wild-type C57BL/6J male
mice (n = 4 per group), bilateral ischemic injury was induced as previ￾ously described (57). In brief, animals were anesthetized and prepared as
described above. Immediately following clamping of the left renal pedi￾cle, the right pedicle was also clamped. Both kidneys were clamped for 30
minutes precisely and both treated identically. Tail bleeds were taken 7
days prior to surgery and 2 and 7 days after ischemia and plasma assessed
for creatinine levels (Creatinine Analyzer II; Beckman Coulter).
Culture and differentiation of bone marrow MSCs. MSCs were purified
from whole bone marrow of EGFP mice as previously described (23).
Cultured MSCs were used between passage 1 and 6 for all experiments.
Cells were cultured in Iscove’s modified DMEM supplemented with
FCS and horse serum and maintained at low cell density (23). Cells were
differentiated into adipocytes as previously described (23). To promote
differentiation into endothelial cells, we prepared Matrigel-coated (BD)
plates. Into wells of 3.5-cm diameter, 0.5 × 106 MSCs were plated in
endothelial growth medium (EGM-2; Cambrex). Medium was changed
every 48 hours. After 2 days, cells formed interconnecting tubes with
branches, reminiscent of capillaries. EGFP-fluorescent MSCs cultured
on Matrigel for 5 days were separated from the gel using cell recovery
solution (BD Biosciences), followed by trypsin (0.25%) and EDTA (0.1%)
to yield a single-cell preparation. Two hours following I/R injury, mice
received 0.5 × 106 MSCs by lateral tail vein injection in 200 µl PBS. In
some experiments, the MSCs were cultured on tissue culture plastic,
and in others, MSCs had been cultured on Matrigel as described above.
Control mice received aliquots of PBS by the same route or an injec￾tion of primary embryonic fibroblasts from C57BL/6J mice prepared
as previously described (58) and grown under identical conditions on
Matrigel. In some experiments, these cells were labeled with a cell track￾er, BCECF (2 µM; Invitrogen Corp.), in order that they could be traced
in vivo. In some experiments, organs were assessed at 24 hours. In other
experiments, a second injection was given at 24 or 48 hours and organs
assessed at 48 hours or 7 days, respectively (n = 4 per group). In addi￾tional experiments, mice received injections of MSCs (n = 6 per group) at
2 hours, 24 hours, 5 days, and 7 days following I/R injury. Organs were
then assessed at 15 days. In still other experiments, 2 hours following I/R
injury, kidneys received a total of 0.5 × 106 MSCs injected intracortically
in 3 separate locations in the sagittal mid-line. Organs were assessed at 2
hours, 2 days, or 7 days following injection (n = 4 per time point).
Immunocytochemistry and β-gal staining. Tissues were snap frozen in OCT
or fixed with PLP fixative. After 2 hours, fixed tissues were transferred
to PBS containing 18% sucrose overnight (4°C), then stored at –80°C.
For sex-mismatched mice, tissues were fixed in 10% formalin or methyl
Carnoy fixative for 12 hours, then were dehydrated through 70–100%
ethanol, transferred to xylene, and paraffin blocked. Three-microm￾eter sections were cut. For β-gal chimeras, 5-µm cryotome cut sections
were dried, washed in PBS for 10 minutes, incubated in blocking buffer
(1 mM MgCl2, 0.01% Na-deoxycholate, 0.02% IGEPAL-CA630, and 5 mM
EGTAinPBS)for20minutesatroomtemperature,andincubatedintheX-gal
mixture [1 mM MgCl2, 0.01% Na-deoxycholate, 0.02% IGEPAL-CA630,
5 mM EGTA, 5 mM K3Fe(CN)6, 5 mM K4Fe(CN)6.3H2O, and 1 µg X-gal;
all from Sigma-Aldrich] for 16 hours at 37°C. Alternatively, dried,
washed sections were incubated for 16 hours with a commercially avail￾able β-gal staining set, specifically designed to minimize staining from
endogenous β-gal (Roche Diagnostics Corp.). Following staining, sec￾tions were washed, then mounted with VECTASHIELD (Vector Labo￾ratories). To immunolabel bacterial β-gal, air-dried 5-µm sections from
snap frozen tissues were treated with avidin, then biotin (Vector Labo￾ratories) to block endogenous biotin, then pre-blocked with Fc Block
(BD Biosciences — Pharmingen) in 10% rabbit serum. Sections were
incubated with biotinylated anti–β-gal antibody (1:200; Sigma-Aldrich)
followed by streptavidin, Alexa Fluor 594 conjugate (1:2,000; Invitrogen
Corp.), then mounted as above.
For EGFP chimeras, tissues were prepared as described above. PLP￾fixed and snap-frozen unfixed, cryotome-cut 5-µm sections were mount￾ed in VECTASHIELD (Vector Laboratories) and viewed directly. For
examination of tissues following injection of EGFP fluorescent MSCs,
snap-frozen unfixed 5-µm sections were mounted and viewed directly.
In addition, sections were blocked with donkey serum and labeled with
rabbit anti-GFP antibodies (1:200; Invitrogen Corp.) or chicken anti￾GFP antibodies (1:500; Aves Laboratories), followed by anti–rabbit-Cy3
or anti–chicken-Cy2 (Jackson Laboratory) to exclude the presence of
MSCs expressing low levels of EGFP in the kidney.
Proximal tubules in β-gal chimeric tissue were identified by the expres￾sion of gp330 (59). To stain for gp330, sections were preblocked (2%
BSA in PBS), then incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-gp330 antibody
(1:500) in donkey serum for 60 minutes. Washing was followed by incu￾bation with FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (1:300) for 30 minutes
at room temperature (Jackson Laboratory), and sections were mounted
in VECTASHIELD (Vector Laboratories). To visualize the actin cytoskel￾eton, we stained tissues with phalloidin-Cy3 as previously described (57).
To quantify the proliferation of cells in the tubules, 40 HPFs in the outer
medullary regions of PAS-stained sections were examined for mitotic cells
adherent to basement membrane within tubules. Tubular cell prolifera￾tion was also assessed by labeling for PCNA as previously described (18).
Briefly, sections were boiled in 10 mM citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for 10 min￾utes, equilibrated in PBS, then labeled with anti-PCNA antibody (1:200;
DakoCytomation) in 10% goat serum followed by goat anti-mouse FITC
(1:200; Sigma-Aldrich). Sections were mounted as above, counterstained
with DAPI, then visualized by fluorescence microscopy for tubular cell
nuclei containing green fluorescence. Forty HPFs of the outer medullary
region were scored for PCNA-positive cells in normal kidney and at 2
days and 7 days after ischemia. For confocal microscopy, sections were
preblocked with Fc Block (BD Biosciences — Pharmingen), then labeled
with anti–α-SMA–Cy3 (1:200; Sigma-Aldrich), anti–CD11b-PE (1:200),
anti–B220-PE (BD Biosciences — Pharmingen), anti–CD45-PE (eBiosci￾ence), or goat anti-vWF (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) followed
by donkey anti-goat Alexa Fluor 594 (1:1,800; Invitrogen Corp.) or rat
anti-mouse CD31 (1:200; eBioscience) followed by preabsorbed goat
anti-rat Cy3 (1:400; Jackson Laboratory). Sections were mounted with
VECTASHIELD and analyzed with a PerkinElmer spinning disk confocal
microscope using laser light at 488 and 568 nm. Sex-mismatched tissues
were dewaxed and labeled with either biotinylated lotus lectin (1:500;
Vector Laboratories) or rabbit anti-vWF (1:400; Chemicon Internation￾al), followed by biotinylated goat anti-rabbit antibodies (1:400; Vector
Laboratories). Staining was achieved using the VECTASTAIN ABC-AP
kit followed by the fluorescent Vector Red stain.
Fluorescent in situ hybridization. Paraffin sections were dewaxed and
rehydrated. Immunolabeling was performed (see above). Once stained,
sections were incubated with 1 M sodium thiocyanate at 80°C for 10

15 minutes, then 0.1 M HCl at 37°C for 10 minutes. After postfixation
with 4% PFA, sections were dehydrated and air-dried. STAR-FISH mouse
Y chromosome–specific probe (Cambio) was added in the manufactur￾er’s buffer, and sections were sealed with a coverslip and rubber cement.
Slides were heated to 80°C for 10 minutes and then incubated over￾night at 37°C. After the coverslip was removed, sections were stringently
washed at 37°C as follows: with ×2 SSC for 5 minutes, formamide/SSC
(50% wt/vol) for 5 minutes (repeated), ×2 SSC for 5 minutes (repeated),
×4 SSC/0.05% Tween for 5 minutes, ×1 SSC for 5 minutes, and ×0.5
SSC for 5 minute. Slides were then mounted with VECTASHIELD/DAPI
(Vector Laboratories) and sealed before viewing. Deconvolution was per￾formed using software from AutoQuant Imaging Inc.
FACS analysis. Bone marrow was harvested from the femurs of EGFP
chimeras or transgenic EGFP mice as previously described (60). Citrated
blood (0.38% final concentration) was centrifuged (1,500 gfor 10 minutes)
and leukocytes separated from erythrocytes by removal of the buffy coat.
Residual erythrocytes were removed from leukocytes by red cell lysis using
ammonium chloride, potassium (ACK) lysis buffer. Leukocytes and bone
marrow were washed in PBS, then fixed with 1% PFA, prior to analysis
for the proportion of cells with green fluorescence. In some experiments,
leukocytes were also labeled with antibodies to lineage markers (CD11b,
Gr-1, B220, CD4, CD8, Ter-119) (eBioscience) using methods previously
described (61). In brief, 2.5 ×105 leukocytes were resuspended in FACS buf￾fer(100 µl) containing anti–CD11b-PE antibodies(monocytes and neutro￾phils), a combination of anti–B220-PE, anti–CD4-PE, anti–CD8-PE anti￾bodies(lymphocytes), or a combination of all lineage markers(as described
above). Cultured EGFP-fluorescent MSCs were labeled with anti–CD34-PE
antibodies(BD Biosciences — Pharmingen) or anti-CD31, anti–c-Kit, anti–
Sca-1 (eBioscience), followed by anti-rat PE antibodies (Vector Laborato￾ries). In each case, we determined nonspecific binding by labeling cells with
an equal concentration of IgG-PE or IgG control antibody (eBioscience).
After washing, cells were fixed with 1% PFA prior to analysis.
Statistics. All data showing value with assessment of error are expressed
as mean ± SEM. Differences among groups were assessed by analysis of
variance and between groups by Mann-Whitney rank-sum test.
