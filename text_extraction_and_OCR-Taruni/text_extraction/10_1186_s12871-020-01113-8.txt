Abstract
Background: Our study aimed to test the hypothesis that the addition of intrathecal morphine (ITM) results in reduced
postoperative opioid use and enhanced postoperative analgesia in patients undergoing open liver resection using a
standardized enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocol with multimodal analgesia.
Methods: A retrospective analysis of 216 adult patients undergoing open liver resection between June 2010 and July 2017
at a university teaching hospital was conducted. The primary outcome was the cumulative oral morphine equivalent daily
dose (oMEDD) on postoperative day (POD) 1. Secondary outcomes included postoperative pain scores, opioid related
complications, and length of hospital stay. We also performed a cost analysis evaluating the economic benefits of ITM.
Results: One hundred twenty-five patients received ITM (ITM group) and 91 patients received usual care (UC group). Patient
characteristics were similar between the groups. The primary outcome - cumulative oMEDD on POD1 - was significantly
reduced in the ITM group. Postoperative pain scores up to 24 h post-surgery were significantly reduced in the ITM group.
There was no statistically significant difference in complications or hospital stay between the two study groups. Total hospital
costs were significantly higher in the ITM group.
Conclusion: In patients undergoing open liver resection, ITM in addition to conventional multimodal analgesic strategies
reduced postoperative opioid requirements and improved analgesia for 24 h after surgery, without any statistically significant
differences in opioid-related complications, and length of hospital stay. Hospital costs were significantly higher in patients
receiving ITM, reflective of a longer mandatory stay in intensive care.

Background
Perioperative analgesia is critical for maximising patient satis￾faction and recovery outcomes in surgery. The optimal post￾operative analgesic technique for patients undergoing open
liver resection is controversial. Continuous thoracic epidural
analgesia has been considered the cornerstone analgesic mo￾dality, however limitations of its use in this setting include
risk of epidural haematoma (in the context of coagulopathy
associated with postoperative hepatic insufficiency), pro￾longed motor block limiting mobilisation, urinary retention,
and hypotension [1–3]. Epidural analgesia is furthermore a
labor intensive and more technically complicated interven￾tion. Indeed, a large international and multicenter landmark
randomized controlled trial (RCT) found that most adverse
morbid outcomes in high-risk patients undergoing major ab￾dominal surgery are not reduced by the use of epidural anal￾gesia [4]. The Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS)
Society guidelines now strongly advocate that routine
thoracic epidural analgesia cannot be recommended in open
liver surgery for ERAS patients and that intrathecal opiates
can be good alternatives when combined with multimodal
analgesia [5].
Single shot intrathecal morphine (ITM) has recently
emerged as a promising alternative practice yielding bet￾ter patient outcomes [6–8]. Intrathecal anaesthesia is a
simpler and quicker alternative neuraxial technique with
a lower rate of technical failure [7]. Similar to epidural
analgesia, intrathecal morphine has been demonstrated
to improve postoperative pain scores and reduce postop￾erative rescue analgesia requirements compared to intra￾venous opioid analgesia [8]. As such, a growing number
of hospitals worldwide have adopted ITM as a preferred
choice for perioperative analgesia for major open
hepato-pancreatic-biliary surgery [6]. However, the ben￾efits of ITM compared to conventional multimodal anal￾gesic strategies for major open liver surgery remain
unclear. Therefore, we conducted a retrospective obser￾vational study to determine if patients undergoing open
liver resection who receive ITM in additional to receiv￾ing a standardized ERAS protocol have better postopera￾tive analgesia compared to patients receiving ERAS
alone. We hypothesize that for patients undergoing open
liver resection using a standardized enhanced recovery
after surgery protocol with multimodal analgesia, the
addition of ITM results in less postoperative opioid use
and enhanced postoperative analgesia.
Methods
Following prospective ethics approval by the Austin
Health Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC no:
LNR/18/Austin/79), we conducted a retrospective ana￾lysis of adult patients who underwent major open liver
resection between July 2010 and June 2017 using a stan￾dardized ERAS protocol. All patients underwent surgery
at the Austin Hospital, a university hospital in Mel￾bourne, Australia with a dedicated high volume hepato￾pancreatic-biliary and liver transplant centre. Eligible pa￾tients were identified by International Statistical Classifi￾cation of Diseases (ICD) codes that included the
following surgical categories: i.) excision of lesion of
liver, ii.) segmental resection of liver, iii.) lobectomy of
liver, iv.) trisegmental resection of liver, and v.) segmen￾tal resection of liver for trauma. In order to ensure a
homogeneous patient cohort, we excluded patients
receiving epidural analgesia, patients undergoing laparo￾scopic liver resection, and patients undergoing deroofing
of liver cyst or liver biopsy. We also excluded patients
with a history of chronic opioid use (defined as near￾daily use of > 60 mg oral morphine equivalent) for 8
weeks or longer. A team of experienced high-volume
surgeons (n = 5) and anaesthetists (n = 6) provided peri￾operative care based on a standardized liver enhanced
recovery after surgery programme. As part of this proto￾col, all patients received an opioid based patient￾controlled analgesia device for postoperative analgesia.
Key outcomes
The primary outcome was cumulative oral morphine
equivalent daily dose in milligrams (oMEDD) on POD 1,
adjusted for the following priori chosen variables: major
resection, patient age, Charlson Comorbidity Index
(CCI), duration of surgery, intraoperative oMEDD use,
adjunct intrathecal clonidine, adjunct intrathecal bupiva￾caine, intraoperative ketamine and postoperative keta￾mine. These factors were chosen due to their potential
influence on total morphine requirements after surgery.
Secondary outcomes included average and maximum
pain at rest and on movement over the first 24 postoper￾ative hours, oMEDD use and postoperative pain scores
in the PACU and on postoperative days 0, 2 and 3. We
measured opioid related side effects, length of hospital
stay, and performed a costs analysis (including readmis￾sions within 30 postoperative days) for both groups of
patients.
Definitions
oMEDD amounts were calculated using the Opioid Dose
Equivalence document endorsed by the Faculty of Pain
Medicine, Australian and New Zealand College of
Anaesthetists [9]. Length of hospital stay was determined
by the period from completion of surgery to discharge.
Time to full ward diet was defined as the period from
completion of surgery to the first mention of tolerating
full ward diet in the patient medical records. Time to
first oral opioid use was defined as the period from com￾pletion of surgery to the first administration of oral opi￾oid after surgery. Daily postoperative pain scores were
measured and recorded by a dedicated Acute Pain

Service using the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS). The
NRS is a single 11-point numeric scale in which a re￾spondent selects a whole number (integers from 0 to 10)
that best reflects the intensity of their pain. A score of 0
indicates no pain, whereas a score of 10 indicates ex￾treme or the worst pain imaginable [10]. Duration of
surgery was defined from skin incision until the final
stitch for wound closure. Major resection was defined as
4 segments or greater; minor resection was defined as 3
segments or less.
Complications were defined as any deviation from the
normal postoperative course, guided by the European
Perioperative Clinical Outcome definitions [11]. Compli￾cations were recorded by two independent clinicians, and
then graded using Clavien-Dindo Classification - a widely
used and validated approach to surgical outcome assess￾ment that assigns severity grades to surgical complications
[12]. In case of disagreement on grading by the two asses￾sors, the case was discussed with a third author.
Costs related to the index hospital admission and any
consequent readmission within 30 postoperative days
were included. Costs related to the preoperative and peri￾operative course were not considered. Allocation of costs
was done based on service volume, and costs were calcu￾lated using an activity-based costing methodology. Raw
costing data was obtained from the hospital’s business in￾telligent unit, and then allocated into categories based on
individual itemisation codes for costs incurred during ad￾mission. These categories included ‘intensive care unit’,
‘medical’ (for example medical consults, allied health,
pathology, blood products, and radiology), ‘pharmacy’, and
‘ward’ costs. For detailed cost analysis of complication in￾cidence and severity, cost centres were further separated
into ‘allied health’ (for example physiotherapy, speech
pathology, dietician), ‘blood products’ (for example
albumin, packed red cells), ‘intensive care unit’, ‘pathology’
(for example tissue diagnosis, blood testing), ‘pharmacy’
(drug dispensing), ‘radiology’ (for example scans, radio￾logical procedures), and ‘ward’ (for example hospital bed,
nursing, catering). Only in-hospital costs were considered,
with both direct and indirect costs assessed to produce a
total cost for each patient. Costs are displayed as medians
and interquartile ranges to more accurately reflect the
economic burden placed upon healthcare providers by
catering for outliers. Costs were inflated to 2018 dollars
based upon the average Australian Consumer Price Index
from 2010 to 2017 inclusive, as reported by the Reserve
Bank of Australia [13]. The average Consumer Price Index
was applied pro rata to each patient based on the number
of days between the admission date and the 1st of January
2018, to ensure all costs were inflated as accurately as pos￾sible reducing error in comparison. Conversion to the
United States Dollar was completed using the market rate
on the 1st of January 2018.
Data collection
Data was extracted from the patient’s electronic medical
records and the Hospital’s computerized laboratory re￾sults. Austin Health utilizes Cerner® electronic health re￾cords that allows comprehensive electronic data capture
and access to patient health information in the peri￾operative setting.
Preoperative data collected included gender, age, body
mass index, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA)
class, principle diagnosis, surgical procedure, segments
resected, and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). The
ASA score provides a simple categorisation of a patient’s
physiological status before surgery and is useful in predict￾ing perioperative morbidity and mortality [14]. The CCI is
a validated method for classifying comorbid conditions
and subsequently estimating the risk of mortality from
comorbid diseases [15]. We additionally collected infor￾mation on whether the patient had smoked in the 1 year
prior to the operation, preoperative biochemistry, liver
function test and full blood examination results.
Intraoperative data collected included duration of sur￾gery, type of resection, and whether the resection was
“major” or “minor”. We collected the dose of intrathecal
morphine administered just prior to the commencement
of the surgery, type and amount of intraoperative anal￾gesia delivered, and types and amounts of fluids and
blood products used intraoperatively.
Postoperative data collected included length of stay,
duration of PCA use, time to full ward diet, time to first
oral opioid use, and time in the intensive care unit
(ICU). We also collected data on postoperative analgesia
agents and anti-emetics administered in the post￾anaesthesia care unit (PACU), on postoperative day 0
(day of surgery) and postoperative days 1 to 3. The num￾ber and severity of postoperative complications, worst
sedation scores and pain scores at rest and on move￾ment in the PACU and POD 0–3 were also collected
from the patient’s electronic medical records.
Statistical methodology
For the primary and the key secondary outcomes, we
used quantile regression modelling adjusted for the fol￾lowing a-priori defined covariates: major resection, pa￾tient age, Charlson Comorbidity Index, duration of
surgery, intraoperative oMEDD use, adjunct intrathecal
clonidine, adjunct intrathecal bupivacaine, intraoperative
ketamine and postoperative ketamine. Quantile regres￾sion models were used due to the violation of the nor￾mality of residuals assumption required for standard
linear regression and lack of suitable transformations to
satisfy these assumptions. Quantile regression models
the association between a set of input variables and spe￾cific percentiles (or quantiles) of the outcome variable
and estimates differences in the quantiles of the outcome

variable between standard care and ITM groups. For ex￾ample, a median (50th percentile) regression of cumula￾tive oMEDD use at 24 h on ITM use estimates the
difference in the median oMEDD use at 24 h between
standard care and ITM groups adjusted for the selected
covariates. For each outcome, we included three quantile
regression models: the 25th percentile, the 50th percent￾ile (median), and the 75th percentile. Standard assess￾ment of collinearity was conducted using variance
inflation factors (VIF) and condition number. For all
other outcomes, continuous data was summarized as
medians and interquartile range (IQR) and compared
using the Mann-Whitney U test. Categorical variables
were summarized as counts (proportions) and compared
using the chi-squared test or Fisher’s Exact test, as ap￾propriate. Statistical analysis was performed using statis￾tical software RStudio (Boston, MA, USA). Figures were
constructed using Prism 6.0 GraphPad software (La Jolla,
CA, USA).
Results
Three hundred thirty-five patients underwent liver resec￾tion at the Austin Hospital between July 2010 and June
2017. Two hundred sixteen patients satisfied the inclusion
criteria. Of these, 91 patients received usual care (Usual
care group) and 125 patients received ITM in addition to
usual care (ITM group). Data collection was complete for
216 (100%) patients. Reason for patients not satisfying in￾clusion criteria included: epidural analgesia (n = 4), laparo￾scopic liver resection (n = 106), deroofing of a liver cyst
(n = 5), and liver biopsy whilst staging pancreatic cancer
without sufficient parenchymal resection (n = 4).
The median (IQR) patient age was 60 (51:67) years.
There were 125 (58%) males and 91 (42%) females. Me￾dian (IQR) body mass index (BMI), ASA score and CCI
were 26.15 (23.1:30.4) kg/m2
, 3 (2:3), and 7 (4:8) respect￾ively. The principal diagnosis and indication for resec￾tion was benign in 33 (15%) patients and malignant in
183 (85%) patients. 32 (15%) patients received chemo￾therapy within 3 months before surgery. 153 (71%) pa￾tients underwent a ‘minor’ (defined as 3 segments or
less) liver resection, and the remaining 63 (29%) patients
underwent a ‘major’ (defined as 4 segments or more)
liver resection. The range of procedures performed in￾cluded 35 (16%) right hepatectomies, 17 (8%) left hepa￾tectomies, 2 (1%) central hepatectomies, 137 (63%)
segmental resections (3 segments or less), and 25 (12%)
extended left or right hepatectomies (5 segments or
more). Baseline patient characteristics between the ITM
and usual care groups is summarized in Table 1.
Key outcomes
The median (IQR) cumulative oMEDD use on postoper￾ative day 1 was 126.7 (53:268) mg in the ITM group vs.
176.3 (105:270) mg in the usual care group (p = 0.04).
Whilst patients in the ITM group required less mor￾phine compared to the control group, the effect size of
this difference depended on their distribution quartile.
Patients in the 25th percentile required 55.7 mg less
morphine (95% CI: 25.6 to 88.4; p = 0.00025); 50th per￾centile 53.3 mg less morphine (95% CI:-22.1 to 98.0; p =
0.058), and 75th percentile 13.9 mg more morphine
(95% CI: − 53.1 to 42.4; p = 0.65). A boxplot of the cu￾mulative oMEDD consumptions on postoperative day 1
is presented in Fig. 1.
Patients in the ITM group reported lower pain scores
at rest and on movement over the first 24 postoperative
hours (see Table 2). Pain scores at rest and in the 25th
percentile showed the most statistically significant bene￾fit from ITM.
Intraoperative outcomes
For patients receiving ITM, the minimum, median (IQR),
and maximum dose of intrathecal morphine delivered
were 150 μg, 300 μg (250:400), and 500 μg, respectively.
To enhance or lengthen the duration of intrathecal anal￾gesia, intrathecal bupivacaine and clonidine were adminis￾tered with the ITM in 26 (21%) and 13 (10%) patients
respectively. The median (IQR) doses of intrathecal cloni￾dine and bupivacaine were 50 μg (30:15) and 10 mg (2:15),
respectively. All patients received additional intraoperative
systemic opioids (Table 3). The median (IQR) IV mor￾phine equivalent of intraoperative opioid received was
29.8 mg (20.0:38.0). No statistically significant difference
between the ITM group and the usual care group in total
operative time or perioperative fluid use and blood prod￾uct administration were identified. Patients in the ITM
group received less intraoperative opioid compared to pa￾tients in the usual care group: median (IQR) 26.7 mg
(20.0:33.3) vs. 33.3 mg (20.0:46.7) IV morphine equivalent,
p = 0.001. The ITM group received less intraoperative
ketamine: median (IQR) 36 mg (20:62.5) vs. 62.5 mg (38.8:
89.5) in the usual care group, p = 0.003. A higher number
of patients in the ITM group required intraoperative
ondansetron (51% vs. 32%, p = 0.005).
Postoperative opioid requirements
In the post anaesthesia care unit, the median (IQR) cu￾mulative oMEDD requirement was lower in the ITM
group: 0 mg (0:10.5) compared to the usual care group 6
mg (0:21), p = 0.001. Postoperative opioid requirements
were lower in the ITM group on postoperative Days 0 to
1. No statistically significant differences were observed
in cumulative oMEDD requirements between the ITM
group and the usual group on postoperative days 2 and
3. For patients receiving ITM, there were no significant
differences observed between the dose of ITM adminis￾tered and the incidence of nausea and vomiting

in ITM patients who were administered other analgesic
adjuncts compared to those who received ITM alone.
The median (IQR) postoperative ketamine require￾ment was lower in the ITM group on postoperative day
0: 30 mg (19.5:48) vs. 64 mg (35.8:96) in the usual care
group, p = 0.006. No statistically significant differences in
postoperative ketamine requirements were identified at
other timepoints. A detailed overview of intraoperative
outcomes and postoperative opioid and ketamine re￾quirements is presented in Table 3.
Postoperative analgesia
In the PACU, the median (IQR) pain score at rest was 1
(0:3) in the ITM group compared to 4 (0:7) in the usual
care group, p = 0.001. On postoperative day 0, median
(IQR) pain scores at rest in the ITM group were 3 (0:5)
vs. 5 (3:7) in the usual care group, p = 0.003. No statisti￾cally significant difference in pain scores at rest on post￾operative days 1–3 were observed. Median (IQR) pain
scores on movement on postoperative day 0 was 3 (1:5)
in the ITM group vs. 4 (3:6) in the usual care group, p =
0.007. No statistically significant differences in pain
scores on postoperative days 2 and 3 between the groups
were identified. For patients receiving ITM, there were
no significant differences in pain scores on movement or
at rest between patients receiving 150-200 μg, 300 μg or
400-500 μg of ITM.
Postoperative outcomes and complications
No statistically significant differences were identified be￾tween the ITM group and usual care group in time to
full ward diet, time to first oral opioid use, complica￾tions, length of stay and 30-day readmission. Patients in
the ITM group had a longer median (IQR) stay in the
ICU: 17 h (12:21.5) vs. 10 h (0:18), p = 0.0001. Patients in
the usual care group had a greater incidence of severe
sedation on postoperative day 0 (42.4% vs 28.8%, p =
0.04). A detailed overview of postoperative and compli￾cation outcomes for each study group is presented in
Table 4. For patients receiving ITM, there were no sig￾nificant differences observed in the severity or number
of complications between patients receiving 150-200 μg,
300 μg or 400-500 μg of ITM. No significant changes
were observed in the length of hospital stay over time
period 2011 to 2017 (P = 0.153 Kruskal-Wallis).
Postoperative cost analysis
Median (IQR) total hospital costs for all patients were
US$11,183 (8458:17,331). Costs relating to blood prod￾ucts, medical complications, MET calls, pharmacy,

radiology and ward were similar between the ITM and
the usual care group. Costs relating to allied health, ICU
and pathology were higher in the ITM group. The me￾dian (IQR) costs for allied health in US$ were $454
(362.7:933.8) in the ITM group vs. $366.6 (116.5:907.8)
in the usual care group, p = 0.002; Median (IQR) total

Discussion
Key findings
We performed a single-centre observational study evalu￾ating the opioid sparing and analgesic effects of ITM on
adult patients undergoing open liver. As hypothesized,
for patients undergoing open liver resection using a
standardized enhanced recovery after surgery protocol
with multimodal analgesia, the addition of ITM resulted
in less postoperative opioid use and enhanced postoper￾ative analgesia. Further, we found no statistically signifi￾cant differences in opioid-related complications, time to
mobilisation, and length of hospital stay. Hospital costs
were significantly higher in patients receiving ITM, re￾flective of a longer mandatory stay in ICU. Our findings
support the use of single shot intrathecal morphine as
an efficacious analgesic technique in patients undergoing
open hepatic resection.
Our findings of reduced oMEDD use at 24 h after sur￾gery in the ITM group are congruent with other studies
reporting that ITM reduces postoperative opioid re￾quirements compared to conventional analgesia strat￾egies for up to 24 h after surgery, but not beyond [8, 16,
17]. Thus ITM use provided statistically significant opi￾oid sparing and analgesic benefits without any increase
in opioid related side effects such as sedation and
delayed respiratory depression, findings previously re￾ported with high-doses of systematically administered
opioids [18]. Interestingly, our findings revealed that
ITM use significantly reduced postoperative opioid con￾sumption at 24 h postoperatively in the 25th and 50th
quartiles, implying the greatest benefit in this cohort of
patients. Identifying these patients preoperatively re￾mains challenging in the present time, however with
modern computational functional genomics being rap￾idly developed, it may be possible to exploit genetic in￾formation from increasingly available data sets for
patients with complex diseases, such as pain and liver
cancer patients, that in turn may offer a new insight into
which patients may benefit most from ITM therapy as
part of complementary patient and surgery centric
approaches.
Interestingly, postoperative pain scores shared the
same temporal pattern as oMEDD use at 24 h after sur￾gery, and pain was significantly reduced by ITM up to
24 h after surgery, but not beyond. The medical litera￾ture evaluating ITM analgesia in open liver resection, as
well as in other procedures including thoracotomy and
caesarian section, mirror our findings of ITM enhancing
analgesia up to 24 h post operation [8, 16, 17, 19]. It is
well-known that the analgesic effect of ITM can last up
to 24 h post operation with a concomitant decrease in
supplementary opioid requirement during this period
[20, 21].
With respect to other postoperative outcomes, our
findings reflect the array of studies which have univer￾sally reported that ITM causes no statistically significant
difference in length of stay in open liver resection com￾pared to other analgesic modalities [8, 16, 17, 19]. Simi￾larly our findings were congruent with others reporting
no differences in complication rate and complication se￾verity between ITM and other analgesic modalities [8,

16, 17, 19]. No neurological sequelae of intrathecal ad￾ministration were observed in our study. Concerns that
intrathecal opioid use is associated with a higher inci￾dence of opioid-related side effects such as sedation and
respiratory depression were unfounded by our results.
Among these side effects, respiratory depression is the
most feared. Our findings are further supported by a
meta-analysis of 28 studies for a range of surgical

procedures, which found that there was no increased
risk of respiratory depression with low-dose ITM
(≤400 μg) compared to systemic opioids [22]. Nonethe￾less, ITM does need to be used with caution in elderly
patients (> 80 years of age), patients with chronic respira￾tory and renal impairment, and patients with obstructive
sleep apnoea [23]. As an additional safety precaution
against delayed-onset respiratory depression, our hos￾pital protocol mandates a 24-h stay in the ICU following
surgery involving ITM analgesia to monitor for respira￾tory depression via the ETCO2, PaO2, PaCO2, respira￾tory rate and oxygen saturation measurements [17, 23].
Reflective of this mandatory ICU stay, we showed that
total postoperative hospital costs were increased in the
ITM group.
Strengths and limitations
There are several strengths and limitations of this study.
To date this is the largest review of ITM use in the con￾text of open hepatic resection. A previous study asses￾sing ITM in open liver resection was conducted by
Sakowska et al. and involved 161 participants - less than
half the size of our study [6]. Furthermore, our study
collected comprehensive data detailing intraoperative
and postoperative analgesia requirements, postoperative
pain scores, and postoperative complications. Previous

studies have been limited by failing to comprehensively
report major outcomes, rather focusing on minor post￾operative complications such as nausea, vomiting and
sedation [8, 16, 23, 24]. In comparison, we have also de￾tailed the incidence of all major systemic complications.
Finally, to our knowledge, no other study has examined
the costs of ITM in open liver resection compared to
conventional analgesic modalities.
This is a single-centre study performed in a high￾volume hepatobiliary unit within a tertiary healthcare
centre, partly limiting the external validity of our findings.
However, our hospital has all the typical characteristics of
many tertiary institutions’ hepatobiliary units, and the sur￾gical and anaesthesia perioperative protocols adopted by
our centre are aligned with those in many other tertiary
centres. All patients were adults who underwent open
hepatic resection, which also limits the generalisability of
our findings to paediatric liver resections, and to adult pa￾tients undergoing other types of surgeries. Given the
retrospective nature of the study, we cannot establish a
causal relationship between ITM and the change in the
perioperative variables we assessed.
Another significant limitation of our findings is that
given the retrospective nature of our study, the collec￾tion of data may have been subject to human error in
the interpretation and recording of data. However, we
consider this an unlikely source of error given the com￾prehensive cross-checks required for data entry at our
institution and the use of electronic medical records.
Additionally, the data collection was conducted by a
clinician not involved in postoperative patient care,
thereby minimising the likelihood of detection bias. Be￾ing a retrospective observational study with no possibil￾ity of randomisation or subject blinding, our study lacks
in validity compared to a randomized controlled trial.
Nonetheless the large sample size, in addition to the
congruence of our results with the existing medical
literature, lends significant strength to our study. Our
findings are hypothesis generating and may provide valu￾able data for power calculations for future studies on
evaluating the effects of ITM on perioperative oMEDD
use, analgesia, and various adverse outcomes. Finally,
validation of our findings with a large multi-centre RCT,
similar in design to the Multicenter Australian Study of
Epidural Anesthesia Trial which involved 25 hospitals in
Australia and South-East Asia, can be justified [4].
Conclusion
In patients undergoing open liver resection, ITM in
addition to conventional multimodal analgesic strategies
reduced postoperative opioid requirements and improved
analgesia for 24 h after surgery, without any statistically
significant differences in opioid-related complications,
time to mobilisation, and length of hospital stay. Hospital
costs were significantly higher in patients receiving ITM,
reflective of a longer mandatory stay in ICU. Our findings
support the use of single shot intrathecal morphine as an
efficacious analgesic technique in patients undergoing
open hepatic resection. A RCT evaluating the effects of
ITM in addition to conventional multimodal analgesic is
justified.
