Abstract
Background: Recipient NK cells may detect the lack of recipient’s (i.e., self) HLA antigens on donor renal tissue by means of
their killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs). KIR genes are differently distributed in individuals, possibly
contributing to differences in response to allogeneic graft.
Methodology/Principal Findings: We compared frequencies of 10 KIR genes by PCR-SSP in 93 kidney graft recipients
rejecting allogeneic renal transplants with those in 190 recipients accepting grafts and 690 healthy control individuals. HLA
matching results were drawn from medical records. We observed associations of both a full-length KIR2DS4 gene and its
variant with 22-bp deletion with kidney graft rejection. This effect was modulated by the HLA-B,-DR matching, particularly in
recipients who did not have glomerulonephritis but had both forms of KIR2DS4 gene. In contrast, in recipients with
glomerulonephritis, HLA compatibility seemed to be much less important for graft rejection than the presence of KIR2DS4
gene. Simultaneous presence of both KIR2DS4 variants strongly increased the probability of rejection. Interestingly, KIR2DS5
seemed to protect the graft in the presence of KIR2DS4fl but in the absence of KIR2DS4del.
Conclusions/Significance: Our results suggest a protective role of KIR2DS5 in graft rejection and an association of KIR2DS4
with kidney rejection, particularly in recipients with glomerulonephritis.

Introduction
Acute or chronic rejection of solid organ grafts such as kidney is
mediated by alloreactive T lymphocytes recognizing major (HLA)
and minor histocompatibility antigens by means of antigen-specific
T cell receptors (TCR) [1,2]. However, a contribution of natural
killer (NK) cells has also been postulated. Thus, infiltration of renal
allografts by NK cells [3–5], increased numbers of NK cells in
peripheral blood of patients acutely rejecting kidney graft [6], and
increased cytotoxicity of recipient NK cells against donor
peripheral blood cells in vitro were described [7].
NK cells recognize the presence of HLA class I (HLA I)
molecules on the surface of potential target cells using several types
of the receptors, among them polymorphic killer cell immuno￾globulin-like receptors (KIRs). Normal cells of an individual are
spared by his or her NK cells because they express normal level of
cell surface HLA I molecules detected by NK cell inhibitory
receptors. However, virus-infected or neoplastic cells tend to lose
HLA I expression, and may be eliminated by NK cells [8].
Due to HLA and KIR polymorphism, in some combinations of
the graft donor and recipient, recipient NK cell’s inhibitory KIRs
may not bind HLA I molecules present on donor cells, leading to
NK cell alloreactivity against the transplanted organ, similarly to
the reaction in opposite direction in hematopoietic cell transplan￾tation [9–11]. In addition, KIRs are expressed also on some T
lymphocytes, particularly on special subpopulation of
CD4+CD282 cytotoxic T cells involved in autoimmune vasculitis
[12–14], potentially influencing their activity in graft rejection.

Human KIRs are encoded by genes located in the chromosomal
region 19q14. KIR genetics is characterized by both allelic (up to
more than 50 alleles for some KIRs) and haplotypic (i.e., different
numbers of inhibitory and activating genes on individual
chromosomes) polymorphism [8,15]. As a result, above 97% of
unrelated persons differ by their KIR genotype [16–17]. Two
categories of KIR haplotypes were described: A-type haplotypes
containing mostly inhibitory KIRs, and only KIR2DS4 and
KIR2DL4 as activating ones, and B-type haplotypes, characterized
by one or more of other activating KIRs in addition to inhibitory
ones. For this reason, people may differ substantially in their NK
and T cell responses, depending on KIR genotype. We have
recently published results showing a contribution of KIR2DS5 gene
to a tolerance of kidney graft as well as to other clinical situations
[18]. Here, we focused on kidney graft rejection and compared
frequencies of 10 KIR genes in recipients rejecting the allogeneic
renal transplant with those in recipients accepting such a graft.
Our study is the first report on different HLA and KIR genetic
associations of kidney graft acute rejection in recipients whose pre￾transplant renal failure resulted from glomerulonephritis versus
those whose renal failure was a result of other disease.
Materials and Methods
Kidney graft recipients and controls
All individuals, including kidney graft recipients, donors, and
healthy controls, were Polish Caucasians. Two hundred eighty￾three kidney patients (clinical data presented in Table 1)
underwent first transplantation and received deceased donor
kidney between 1989 and 2008 (166 patients after 2000). All
patients were treated with triple-therapy (Figure 1) as initial
immunosuppression that incorporated cyclosporine (n = 219) or
tacrolimus (n = 64, beginning in 2000) in combination with
azathioprine (n = 129) or mycofenolate mofetil (n = 154, since
1998) (Figure 2) and steroids. No induction with antibodies was
used. During the follow up (mean time was 7 years) there were 246
(87%) patients who were treated with the same calcineurin
inhibitor. Among 29 patients who changed the type of calcineurin
inhibitor, 20 patients were converted from CsA to tacrolimus after
an episode of rejection treated with methylprednisolone. Calci￾neurin inhibitor was withdrawn in 8 individuals. There were 233
patients who received the same type of purine metabolism
inhibitor during follow up: azathioprine (n = 84) and mycofenolate
mofetil (n = 149). Azathioprine was replaced by mycofenolate
mofetil in 33 patients (in 20 patients after an episode of acute
rejection) or stopped in 12 patients. The frequency of a change in
treatment regimen was almost 2-fold higher in patients who
suffered a rejection (refers to 38% and 21% of patients with and
without rejection, respectively, p = 0.0063).
93 recipients exhibited symptoms of acute graft rejection based
on clinical criteria (an increase in serum creatinine level of at least
20% above the baseline measurements not attributable to another
cause) confirmed by histopathological examination according to
Banff criteria [19]. Apart from three patients, all had a biopsy￾confirmed acute rejection episode. Remaining 190 recipients
experienced stable graft function during long-term follow-up. 31
(33%) patients who suffered acute rejection subsequently lost their
grafts in comparison to 22 (12%) patients without an episode of
rejection. During the follow-up, 5 out of 93 (5.4%) patients with
AGR and 13 out of 190 (6.8%) patients without AGR died for
different reasons.
Six hundred and ninety unrelated healthy volunteers, consti￾tuting a basic control group in KIR studies performed in our
laboratory, were recruited in the years 2001–2008 by the Regional
Center of Blood Transfusion, Wroc3
aw, as well as by clinics of the
Wroc3
aw Medical University, the Medical University of Warsaw,
and the Pomeranian Medical University, Szczecin.
The same cohorts of patients and controls have already been
used to describe a protective effect of KIR2DS5 gene on kidney
graft rejection and some other clinical situations [18].
The Bioethics Committee of the Wroc3
aw Medical University
specifically approved this study. Signed written informed consent
was given by all participants.
DNA isolation and KIR typing
DNA was isolated from venal blood as described [20,21]. The
presence or absence of KIR genes was detected by either individual
[20–22] or multiplex [23] polymerase chain reactions (PCR)
which, when tested on the same samples, gave virtually identical
results. Our KIR typing has been validated three times per year by
the International KIR Exchange program organized by the
Immunogenetics Center of the University of California at Los
Angeles.
HLA-A, -B, and -DR typing of donors and recipients has been
routinely done before transplantation either in Non-Public Tissue
Typing Facility at our Institute or in other transplant centers in
Poland, and it was drawn from the clinical histories of the patients.
Tissue samples were available for only 42 donors, therefore their
HLA-C typing was possible only in these instances, had statistically
insufficient power, and therefore its results are not presented here.
Recipient HLA-C variants encoding C1 and C2 epitopes were
described and discussed earlier [18].
Statistical analysis
General linear model (GLM) with binomial errors was used to
investigate relationship between clinical and genetic variables and
probability of rejecting the transplanted kidney (Table 2).
Frequencies of KIR genes in recipients and HLA matching between
donors and recipients were explanatory variables. Clinical
characteristics (age, sex, creatinine, course of transplantation and
time of observation) was concomitant variables. Akaike’s informa￾tion criterion (AIC) was used as a measure of fit of models. Bootstrap
approach was employed to estimate model’s coefficients and 95%
confidence intervals. Chi-squared test with Yates’ continuity
correction was used to test hypothesis that rejection and type of
genotype were independent. To test differences in KIR’s distribu￾tion among patients and control, a group permutation test was
employed. This procedure was based on Mahalanobis distance
(DM) between two groups and test performed in 10 000
permutations. Odds ratio (OR) was computed as a measure of
effect size. Probability that graft is not rejected at a given time, S(t),
was computed according to the Kaplan-Meier method, comparing
KIR genotypes. Haplotype frequencies (HFs) among two KIRs:
2DS4 (full-length or deletion variant) and 2DS5 were estimated
with maximum likelihood function [24].
Measures for the estimation of linkage disequilibrium (LD) were
the correlation of two alleles frequencies, r, global squared
correlation between two loci, R2 and Kullback-Leibler divergency
two loci from LE [24,25]. For two loci 2DS4 and 2DS5, r and R2

Results
HLA and KIR2DS4 gene effects on acute kidney graft
rejection
Frequencies of KIR genes were not different between patients
and controls (Table 3). However, there were some differences
between patients with acute graft rejection (AGR) (determined by
Banff criteria) and patients without AGR. First, the frequency of
the KIR2DS5 gene in patients with AGR was two times lower than
in control individuals (p = 0.0056). This protective effect of
KIR2DS5 gene on kidney graft rejection has already been
published recently on the same cohorts of patients and controls
[18]. Multivariate analysis indicated significant protective effect of
HLA-B,-DR matching (Table 2) but HLA-A did not affect graft
fate (data not shown). We also observed that the presence of both
KIR2DS4 full-length (KIR2DS4fl) and 22-base pair deletion variant
(KIR2DS4del) gene was increasing a probability of rejection at least
twofold (Table 2). This effect was amplified to a great extent by
the HLA-B,-DR mismatching (matching = 0, Figure 3).
Effects of KIR2DS4 gene variants and KIR2DS5 gene on
the probability of graft rejection
Probability that graft was not rejected at a given time, S(t), was
computed for the presence or absence of KIR2DS4fl, KIR2DS4del
or both (Figure 4). Simultaneous presence of both gene variants
strongly increased the probability of graft rejection, whereas the
presence of only KIR2DS4fl, only KIR2DS4del, or none of them
gave much lower probability of rejection. Interestingly, the two
variants of KIR2DS4 gene had opposite influence on the effect of
KIR2DS5 gene: KIR2DS5 seemed to protect the graft stronger in
the presence of KIR2DS4fl than in its absence (Figure 5), but
stronger in the absence than presence of KIR2DS4del (Figure 6).
Combinations of KIR genes gave 133 different genotypes
present in patients and/or controls (data not shown). These
genotypes were divided into AA and BX genotypes, containing
two A haplotypes or at least one B haplotype, respectively (for a
definition of A and B haplotypes, see Introduction). Two
individual AA genotypes were distributed significantly differently
between patient subgroups: among patients with the genotype
No. 1 acute graft rejection (AGR) was nearly four times less
frequent than lack of AGR (21.9% vs 78.1%), whereas in those
with the genotype No. 2 the ratio of AGR and non-AGR was 1:1
(Table 4). Interestingly, these two genotypes differed only by the
absence of full-length KIR2DS4 gene in the genotype No. 1 and its
presence in the genotype No. 2, and both were devoid of KIR2DS5
by definition, as AA genotypes. An additional AA genotype
containing KIR2DS4fl but no KIR2DS4del gene was extremely rare

(one individual among patients and 8 in controls), therefore it
could not play any role in rejection and was omitted from our
calculations. Within BX (i.e., non-AA) genotype group, fraction of
patients with AGR was nearly two times less frequent than these
without AGR. These differences between genotype groups were
not accidental (x2= 6.675, df = 2, p = 0.035).
KIR2DS4 and KIR2DS5 are in negative linkage disequilibrium
(LD) in all populations tested so far [28]. Table 5 shows that they
are in negative LD also in our population. KIR2DS4/KIR2DS5
haplotype frequencies for non-rejectors and controls were very
similar, and these two groups were combined in the following
calculations. Likelihood ratio statistics (LRS) for patients with
AGR versus combined group of patients without AGR and
controls was high, which suggests that haplotype frequencies in the
former were different from those in the latter (p = 0.05). We see,
for example, that a haplotype KIR2DS42/KIR2DS5+ (2/2DS5)
was three times less frequent in patients with AGR than in other
groups. This seems to confirm a protective role of KIR2DS5 in
graft rejection shown above.
Difference between patients with glomerulonephritis
and those with other kidney diseases in association of
acute graft rejection with KIR2DS4 and HLA genotype
Multivariate analysis revealed also a difference between patients
whose end stage renal failure was caused by glomerulonephritis
and those with other nephropathies. Namely, in the non￾glomerulonephritis group, HLA-B,-DR matching seemed to be
much more important for acute graft rejection than the presence
or absence of KIR2DS4 gene variants (Figure 7, right panel).
Thus, in the case of perfect HLA-B,-DR matching (matching = 4),
the presence or absence of KIR2DS4fl and KIR2DS4del genes only
very weakly influenced graft fate. Recipients of completely HLA￾B,-DR incompatible grafts (matching = 0) possessing both forms of
KIR2DS4 gene had only 6 times higher chance of kidney rejection
than recipients of similarly HLA-B,-DR-incompatible grafts nega￾tive for KIR2DS4 (Figure 7, right panel).
In contrast, in recipient group with glomerulonephritis, HLA
incompatibility seemed to be much less important than KIR2DS4
for graft rejection. For example, completely HLA-mismatched
KIR2DS4-negative recipients had only about 1.4 times higher
chance of acute rejection than perfectly HLA-matched KIR2DS4-
negative recipients (Figure 7, left panel). On the other hand, the
presence of both forms of KIR2DS4 gene had strong effect on graft
rejection in glomerulonephritis group, as even perfect HLA
matching did not reduce a chance of rejection below odds ratio
of 85 (Figure 7, left panel). Individuals from the glomerulone￾phritis group possessing both variants of KIR2DS4 and perfect
HLA-B,-DR matching had about 15 times higher chance of
rejection than analogous persons from the non-glomerulonephritis
group (see Figure 7, both panels).

Discussion
We compared the distribution of KIR genes in patients rejecting
and non-rejecting kidney graft as well as in healthy controls.
Among individual KIR genes, only KIR2DS4 (both full-length and
deletion variants) was remarkably more frequent in patients with
AGR than in patients with stable graft function and controls.
Moreover, this effect was particularly strong in the absence of
KIR2DS5 gene which exerted opposite effect, i.e., its presence
decreased the chance of graft rejection as published already on the
same cohorts of patients and controls [18]. It is interesting in this
context that KIR2DS4 molecule was expressed on remarkable
proportion of CD4+CD282 T cell clones isolated from an acute
coronary syndrome patient [29]. Also, dialyzed patients exhibited
an increased number of circulating CD4+CD282 T cells [30]. In
addition, CMV positivity is universal in our transplant population
(data not shown), and the association of CMV infection and the
presence of CD4+CD282 cells is well documented (ref.30 and
references therein). CD4+CD282 T cells, virtually absent from
peripheral blood of healthy individuals but present in acute
coronary syndrome and rheumatoid vasculitis [29], multiple
sclerosis [14] and, most important here, in end-stage renal disease
[30,31], were found to be resistant to immunoregulation [14] and
therefore postulated to play a role in autoimmune diseases and
aging [12]. KIR2DS4fl encodes an activating receptor which might
possibly be involved in stimulation of effector cells (e.g.,
CD4+CD282 T cells) contributing to transplant rejection,
whereas KIR2DS4del potentially codes for a soluble molecule
[32]. It might be that, in kidney graft recipients, this soluble
KIR2DS4 molecule is masking a ligand for membrane-bound
KIR2DS4 or another receptor of some regulatory cells (T, NK, or
other). The ligand for KIR2DS5 receptor is not known, however it
has been observed that the simultaneous presence of KIR2DS5
gene and HLA-C-encoded epitopes for both KIR2DL1 and
KIR2DL2/3 receptors significantly decreased leukemia-free sur￾vival of hematopoietic stem cell-transplanted patients [33], which
could suggest KIR2DS5 interaction with HLA-C. Thus, in the
case of renal transplant recipients, soluble KIR2DS4 might block
interaction of KIR2DS5 with its ligand which otherwise would
protect a graft from rejection. In recipients negative for
KIR2DS4del gene the presence of KIR2DS5 seems to favor the

acceptance of the graft, particularly in the presence of KIR2DS4fl
gene. The reason for the latter effect is not clear; either both
KIR2DS5 and KIR2DS4fl act in the same direction, e.g.
expressed on the same or on two different regulatory cells, or,
alternatively, the presence of KIR2DS4fl gene, by excluding the
presence of its allele, KIR2DS4del, from the same chromosome,
decreases its frequency in KIR2DS4fl-positive patient population.
KIR2DS4 molecule differs from KIR2DS1 and KIR2DS2/3 by
weaker interaction with HLA-C and by binding to HLA-A*11
[34]. As mentioned in Material and Methods section, blood,
lymphoid tissue or DNA samples of majority of donors were not
available for our study, and their HLA-C typing was not possible
here. However, in a recent study, Hanvesakul and coworkers [35]
have not detected any association between donor HLA-C￾encoded KIR ligand and acute rejection of kidney allograft. On
the other hand, these authors have reported an effect of recipient
HLA-C on the kidney graft rejection, i.e., a protective effect of C2
on allograft survival. They observed donor-derived NK cells in the
allograft at the time of transplantation. These NK cells could
stimulate maturation of dendritic cells which would then be
capable of indirect stimulation of adaptive immune system for
alloreactivity. In vitro studies of Hanvesakul et al. [35] have shown
that donor-derived, interleukin-15-activated NK cells promoted
efficiently the maturation of recipient dendritic cells only when
these were C2-negative. They propose that, after kidney trans￾plantation, donor NK cells interacting with recipient C2-positive
dendritic cells do not stimulate them for maturation as efficiently
as in C2-negative recipients, and this is beneficial for graft survival.
In our earlier study, we have not observed such an effect of
recipient C2 on graft survival; on the contrary, we have rather
seen some, albeit weak and non-significant, association of C2 with
kidney rejection [18]. The reason for this discrepancy may lie in
numbers: our sample (283 patients) was 2.7 times less numerous
than that of the British group (760 individuals). Alternatively, the

KIR and HLA Genotypes in Kidney Graft Rejection
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 7 September 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 9 | e44718

British and our patients might have differed in a cause of renal
failure: we have found a substantial genetic difference between
recipients with glomerulonephritis and those with other condi￾tions, whereas Hanvesakul et al. [35] did not show a clinical status
of their patients before transplantation.
HLA-A*11 allele (a KIR2DS4 ligand, see above) frequency in
the Polish population is 6.239%, as established by Schmidt and
colleagues [36]; therefore, its effect on kidney graft survival, if any,
could not be strong. Nevertheless, we have noticed that a majority
of HLA-A11-positive graft-rejecting recipients (4 out of 5) possessed
KIR2DS4fl gene, whereas only one fifth of A11-positive patients
with stable graft function (4 out of 20) typed positive for KIR2DS4fl
(p = 0.02). However, the numbers were far too small for any
conclusion. No difference between distribution of KIR2DS4del
variant in A11-positive patients with and without AGR was seen
(data not shown).
So far, only few publications dealt with KIR gene associations
with kidney graft rejection. Tran et al. [37] studied an effect of
KIR ligand (i.e., C1, C2, and Bw4) matching on graft survival in
1416 recipients of cadaver kidney (both first grafts and regrafts)
from all inhabited continents, but did not detect any effect.
Similarly negative result was obtained by Kreijveld et al. [38] who
tested not only KIR ligands, but also KIR genes themselves as well
as combinations of both in Dutch population. On the other hand,
upon testing a KIR polymorphism in HLA-identical recipient￾donor pairs from U.S.A., Cirocco et al. [39] obtained a result
suggesting protective effect of KIR2DL2 and KIR2DS2 genes;
however, their study was based on extremely low number of
individuals (only 12 recipient-donor pairs). Nevertheless, this
finding was confirmed by Kunert et al. [40] on 105 graft recipients
and 119 controls in Germany. Finally, van Bergen et al. [41]
observed an effect of KIR-KIR ligand mismatch between recipient
and donor in Dutch population, but only in HLA-A,-B,-DR￾compatible donor-recipient pairs, i.e., when HLA-identical part￾ners differed in their KIR gene repertoire, resulting in lack of a
ligand in donor for a KIR present in recipient. Notably, the effect
of KIRs in HLA-matched pairs was as strong as that of HLA-A,-B
mismatch in pairs matched only for HLA-DR [41,42]. In our study,
we observed a strong effect of KIR2DS4 variants in patients with
glomerulonephritis, where HLA-B,-DR mismatch exerted much
weaker influence on the graft fate, whereas in recipients without
glomerulonephritis the effect of HLA-mismatch was predominant.
The striking finding of this study was the stronger association of
KIR2DS4 polymorphism than HLA incompatibility in GN patients.
We can speculate that engagement of KIRs in inflammatory
pathway activation defined by their polymorphism may represent
a common link between autoimune and alloimmune response.
The possibility that KIR-ligand interaction may aggravate both
the natural history of glomerulonephritis sustaining immune injury
leading to end-stage renal disease and influence alloimmune

response causing acute rejection cannot be ruled out. In this
setting, KIR2DS4 polymorphism can provoke the immune
response as it can modulate autoimmunity. We can hypothesize
that GN and non-GN patients may differ in KIR2D receptor
expression on NK and T cells, particularly in those rejecting vs.
non-rejecting the graft, as it has recently been shown in liver
transplantation [43].
In summary, our results suggest that typing of the recipient for
KIR2DS4 and KIR2DS5 genes may help to predict the outcome of
renal transplantation. We show here, for the first time, that the
effect of KIR genotype on the fate of kidney graft in recipients with
glomerulonephritis seems to be stronger than that of HLA
matching, whereas opposite is true for patients with other causes
of end-stage renal disease. The lack of strong association of graft
rejection with HLA-B,-DR mismatching in recipients with glomer￾ulonephritis could not have been observed in earlier studies done
without stratification for the presence or absence of KIR2DS4 gene.
However, a small number of data that was collected over a long
time period is a limitation to the reliability of our findings.
Therefore, more definitive studies would require data input from
much higher number of patients and, preferably, from more than
one institution.
