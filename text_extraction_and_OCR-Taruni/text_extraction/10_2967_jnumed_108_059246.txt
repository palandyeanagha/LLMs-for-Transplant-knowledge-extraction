Molecular imaging holds the promise of becoming a key diag￾nostic modality in cardiovascular medicine by allowing visualiza￾tion of specific targets and pathways that precede or underlie
changes in morphology, physiology, and function. As such, mo￾lecular imaging aims at detecting precursors or early stages of
cardiovascular disease and at monitoring and guiding novel, in￾creasingly specific and versatile cardiovascular therapies. Imag￾ing of myocardial metabolism and autonomic innervation are
already used in current practice, and a wide variety of other tar￾gets and probes is on the horizon. This focused review provides
an overview of the opportunities and challenges that molecular
imaging faces to fulfill its promises in clinical cardiovascular
medicine.

The field of clinical cardiovascular imaging is changing.
On the one hand, novel high-resolution techniques such as
multislice CT or MRI provide ever-improving images of
cardiac and coronary morphology. On the other hand, it
becomes clear that the increasing variety and specificity
of cardiovascular therapies require increasingly specific
diagnostic information and that interrogation of morphol￾ogy and pathophysiology may not suffice for this purpose
(1–3).
Furthermore, whereas myocardial perfusion imaging is still
the mainstay of cardiovascular radionuclide applications for
the diagnostic and prognostic workup of coronary artery
disease, several alternative imaging methodologies for non￾invasive assessment of perfusion are emerging. At the same
time, nuclear imaging technology has progressed signifi￾cantly toward higher sensitivity and resolution, and an
increasing number of molecule-targeted radiotracers is being
introduced. These developments indicate an evolution of
clinical nuclear imaging beyond the assessment of myocar￾dial perfusion, toward characterization of molecular events on
the tissue level. It is hoped that radiotracer techniques, with
their unique translational potential and their superior detec￾tion sensitivity, will take a leading role in the emerging
paradigm of personalized cardiovascular medicine, where
therapeutic or preventive strategies are based on individual
disease biology that is defined by molecular imaging
tests (4).
CURRENT TRENDS IN CARDIOVASCULAR MEDICINE
Modern cardiovascular medicine on the one hand is
continuously seeking to improve algorithms to prevent
disease and disease complications. On the other hand,
treatment of disease is becoming increasingly versatile and
is being tailored to individual needs. The promise of car￾diovascular molecular imaging is to expedite this trend by
allowing visualization of specific targets and pathways that
precede or underlie changes in morphology, physiology,
and function, so that clinical decision making can occur at
earlier stages of the disease process (Fig. 1). Rapidly ad￾vancing basic cardiovascular sciences, together with an
increasingly successful convergence of preclinical research
and imaging, have facilitated the introduction of novel
therapeutic approaches to prevent and treat cardiovascular
disease. The traditional options of pharmacotherapy, per￾cutaneous intervention, or open-heart surgery are now aug￾mented by various implantable devices, new pharmacologic
agents, new surgical approaches, and targeted delivery of
proteins, genes, cells, or tissue patches to diseased areas of
the heart. Although these new therapeutic options are
promising, selection of the most suitable candidates for a
given approach requires diagnostic tests in order to opti￾mize efficacy and cost-effectiveness and ultimately achieve
broad clinical acceptance (5,6).
Given the increasing specificity of these novel therapies,
it is likely that more specific imaging tests that interrogate
cellular or subcellular target mechanisms will be needed.
Decades ago, it was learned that assessment of left ven￾tricular function and myocardial perfusion is not sufficient
to select those patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy who
will benefit from surgical revascularization. Assessment of
myocardial metabolism, a tissue-specific biologic signal,

has been found to be superior in this regard and gave rise to
an entire new diagnostic field—that of myocardial viability
imaging (7). It is the vision of cardiovascular molecular
imaging professionals that, in a similar manner, several
molecular imaging tests will emerge in the future as key
diagnostic procedures for other novel clinical cardiovascu￾lar therapies.
CLINICAL CARDIOVASCULAR MOLECULAR IMAGING
TECHNOLOGY
In the preclinical setting, molecular imaging of the
cardiovascular system uses multiple modalities, including
optical, nuclear, MR, CT, and ultrasound imaging (1,2), but
clinical application in humans has been limited mostly to
nuclear techniques. In addition to methodologic issues with
the other techniques (optical imaging, for example, is
confined to small animals because of limited penetration of
light), the advantage of radionuclide techniques in humans
is explained mostly by their superior sensitivity in detecting
labeled molecules within the human body (2).
The roots of cardiovascular molecular imaging lie in the
assessment of myocardial metabolism and myocardial auto￾nomic innervation (Fig. 2). These areas have also emerged
as its first true clinical applications. The Food and Drug
Administration–approved glucose analog 18F-FDG is not
used only for myocardial viability assessment. More re￾cently, 18F-FDG has proven to be versatile and has suc￾cessfully been used for imaging of atherosclerotic plaque
inflammation (8) and labeling of stem cells for tracking
after transplantation (6). Another 18F-FDG application may
be ischemic memory imaging, in which fatty acid analogs
such as 123I-b-methyl-iodophenylpentadecanoic acid have
more recently also been introduced (9). For innervation
imaging, the integrity of presynaptic sympathetic nerve
terminals is measured using catecholamine analogs such as
the recently Food and Drug Administration–approved 123I￾metaiodobenzylguanidine or several available PET com￾pounds (10). Risk stratification in heart failure has emerged
as a promising application for innervation imaging, in
which the degree of impaired innervation may provide
more accurate information than conventional markers (11).
Other molecular mechanisms that have been explored in
small human studies using multiple novel compounds in￾clude cell death (12), neurohumoral receptors (13), cell–
matrix interaction (14,15), and stem cell tracking (Fig. 3)
(6). The major purpose of these compounds can be
described either as the detection of early disease stages
that precede physiologic or morphologic abnormalities or
as the guidance of therapy by more specific selection of
suitable candidates and earlier response detection.
DETECTION OF EARLY DISEASE AND
DISEASE PRECURSORS
For earlier detection of disease, molecular imaging
techniques are primarily focusing on 2 areas: the vulnerable
plaque, which precedes myocardial infarction, and left
ventricular remodeling, which precedes heart failure.
Clinical observations that acute coronary events often
result from rupture of atherosclerotic plaques at sites with
no or minor luminal narrowing have stimulated the search
for techniques to identify vulnerable, rupture-prone lesions
(8). These may show characteristic morphologic features

but may still differ in their biology and their activity,
ultimately leading to rupture. Molecule-targeted ap￾proaches aim at plaque inflammation, apoptosis, extracel￾lular matrix activation, or platelet binding. But many of the
approaches are still at the preclinical or early clinical level,
suggesting that this field remains a work in progress.
Challenges related to the best targeting approach, to
translation of animal model results to the clinical setting,
to adequate imaging methodology for visualization of cor￾onary artery biology, and to a suitable target patient
population need to be overcome. The final goal of these
efforts is improved clinical risk assessment through in vivo
assessment of vascular biology.
Interestingly, many of the molecular mechanisms thought
to play a role in plaque vulnerability also play a role in the
development of left ventricular remodeling. These mecha￾nisms include inflammation, apoptosis, matrix-metallopro￾teinase activation, and integrin expression (12,14,15).
Activation of the renin-angiotensin system, impairment of
autonomic innervation, and changes in substrate use are
other relevant pathways that can be targeted for this purpose
(10,13,16). Remodeling is defined as the continuous
increase in left ventricular chamber size after a triggering
event (mostly myocardial infarction), which ultimately
leads to clinically overt contractile dysfunction and heart
failure. Because of increasing survival rates for myocardial
infarction, remodeling is an increasing health care problem
if the substantial costs for treatment of heart failure are
considered. A technique for predicting who is at high risk
for remodeling and heart failure would therefore be of
considerable value. Molecular imaging of the aforemen￾tioned targets holds the promise of better identifying
individuals at risk, by identifying key biologic mechanisms
that trigger the process. But despite the variety of available
targets and tracers, conclusive evidence of clinical useful￾ness has not yet been obtained for these approaches.
However, the goal may be somewhat easier to achieve in a
clinical setting than through molecular identification of
vulnerable plaques, because the myocardium is a larger
target that can be imaged more robustly.
GUIDANCE AND MONITORING OF THERAPY
Although the use of clinical molecular imaging to detect
earlier stages of disease and to guide algorithms to prevent
disease progression is promising, it remains a vision and
requires continuing preclinical, translational, and clinical
research. Another major area in which molecular imaging
has already been clinically successful is the monitoring of
therapy. Characterization of novel approaches, selection of
the most useful candidates, guidance of therapeutic deci￾sion making, and monitoring of the effects of therapy have
all been accomplished in human studies.
Ideally, the characterization of a molecular disease
mechanism by imaging is directly translated into a ther￾apeutic strategy aiming at correction of the molecular
abnormality. A practical example is the alteration of
myocardial substrate use in heart failure. Metabolic imag￾ing has suggested that a substrate switch from glucose to
fatty acids contributes to impaired efficiency and promotes
heart failure development (16). More recently, similar
metabolic imaging techniques have demonstrated the
beneficial effects of a metabolic modulator, trimetazidine.
The agent improved ejection fraction and reversed meta￾bolic impairments by lowering fatty acid use (17).
Heart failure has also emerged as a primary target for
sympathetic neuronal imaging. Global downregulation of
myocardial catecholamine uptake predicts deterioration
because it seems to be involved in a vicious circle whereby
impaired function leads to a hyperadrenergic state, which in

turn leads to further impairment of function (10,11). Also,
importantly, after myocardial infarction there seems to be a
poorly innervated border zone of viable myocardium that
results in electrophysiologic abnormalities and may be a
substrate for life-threatening arrhythmia (18,19). This
regional pattern could be used to better guide therapy
directed at prevention of sudden cardiac death in the future.
Finally, some novel molecular and cellular interventions
have been moving rapidly from preclinical to clinical settings
and encountered difficulties in reproducing the success
observed in animals when applied in the human setting.
These difficulties have triggered the development of specific
molecular imaging techniques to further elucidate the
mechanisms and efficacy of these therapies. Key examples
are cardiac gene therapy, for which reporter gene imaging
methodology has been introduced (3,5,20), and cardiac stem
cell therapy, for which multiple techniques for cell labeling to
track their retention and engraftment have been introduced
(6,21,22). Thus, although the specificity of novel cardiovas￾cular therapies is continuously increasing, it is becoming
increasingly obvious that a therapy targeting tissue-specific
biologic pathways will also benefit from more specific
diagnostic tests that allow for visualization of these pathways.
TRANSLATION OF NOVEL APPROACHES
Thus, there are significant opportunities and promises for
molecular imaging in the practice of cardiovascular medi￾cine. Although clinical application is currently limited
mostly to imaging of metabolism and innervation, the chal￾lenge of translating preclinical compounds into the clinical
arena must be overcome in order to broaden the clinical
cardiovascular molecular imaging toolbox. This move into
the clinic requires further research, facilitation of regulatory
steps, and recruitment of funding. Importantly, the specificity
of molecule-targeted approaches may limit their clinical
application to specific situations and may narrow scientific
and commercial interest in a new approach. It is therefore
important to emphasize that many molecular mechanisms
relevant to cardiac disease are also relevant to vascular
disease and tumor biology, thus increasing the applicability
of a targeted compound. Ultimately, the further translation,
broadening application, and clinical success of cardiovascu￾lar molecular imaging will require a sustained, concerted
effort by basic scientists, imagers, clinical cardiologists,
professional societies, and industry.
CONCLUSION
Molecular imaging has great potential to contribute to
clinical cardiovascular medicine by improving the under￾standing of disease processes and therapeutic mecha￾nisms. It is hoped that this potential will result in
algorithms for earlier disease detection and in improved
therapeutic decision making. Metabolic imaging tech￾niques already play a clinical role, and imaging of the
autonomic nervous system is about to reach clinical
acceptance. Finally, there is a plethora of other innovative
tracers directed against molecular targets that are highly
relevant to cardiovascular medicine. Translational progress is
therefore highly relevant to broadening the clinical role.
