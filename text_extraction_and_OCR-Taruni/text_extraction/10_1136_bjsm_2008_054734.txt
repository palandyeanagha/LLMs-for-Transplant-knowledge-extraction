ABSTRACT
Congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) affects an estimated
1 in 2500 people and typically presents with syncope,
seizures or sudden death. Whereas someone exhibiting
marked prolongation of the QT interval with QTc
exceeding 500 ms who was just externally defibrillated
from torsades de pointes while swimming poses
negligible diagnostic challenge as to the unequivocal
probability of LQTS, the certainty is considerably less for
the otherwise asymptomatic person who happens to host
a QTc value coined ‘‘borderline’’ (QTc >440 ms).
Although a normal QT interval imparts a much lower risk
of life-threatening events, it does not preclude a patient
from nevertheless harbouring a potentially lethal LQTS￾causing genetic mutation. Indeed, genetic testing exerts
significant diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic impli￾cations. However, the 12-lead ECG remains the universal
initial diagnostic test in the evaluation of LQTS and is
subject to miscalculation, misinterpretation and mis￾handling. This review discusses the components of
accurate QTc measurement and diagnosis, re-examines
what is known about factors affecting QT interval
measurement, and clarifies current recommendations
regarding diagnosis of so-called ‘‘borderline’’ QT interval
prolongation. The current guideline recommendations for
the athlete with LQTS are also summarised.
Congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) was first
described clinically as Jervell and Lange-Nielsen
syndrome and Romano Ward syndrome in the late
1950s and early 1960s.1–3 The trademark event for
the symptomatic LQTS patient is the potentially
lethal ventricular dysrhythmia called torsades de
pointes.4 Torsades de pointes can precipitate
syncope, seizures or sudden death, depending on
whether the heart rhythm spontaneously reverts
to normal rhythm or if the patient is defibrillated
to normal rhythm before death occurs.5 6
LQTS affects an estimated 1 in 2500 people4 and
is understood to be a collection of genetically
distinct arrhythmogenic disorders resulting from
genetic mutations in (primarily) cardiac potassium
and sodium ion channels, termed ‘‘cardiac channe￾lopathies’’.7 Mutations in proteins associated with
ion channels but not part of the channels
themselves can also cause LQTS.8 9 Overall, 12
LQTS-susceptibility genes have been discovered
thus far. Mutations in the potassium channel genes
KCNQ1 (LQT1) and KCNH2 (LQT2) as well as the
sodium channel gene SCN5A (LQT3) account for
,75% of all cases of clinically definite LQTS and
comprise over 95% of genetically identifiable
LQTS.10–13
DIAGNOSING LQTS: THE CHALLENGE
The diagnosis of LQTS continues to be difficult.
Some physicians continue to use a published
clinical diagnostic assessment score (table 1) that
incorporates personal and family history as well as
ECG findings to compute ‘‘low’’, ‘‘intermediate’’
and ‘‘high’’ probabilities for the diagnosis of
LQTS.14 Here, points are given for specific history
components and findings on a 12-lead ECG, with a
total score >4 conveying a high probability of
LQTS diagnosis. Points are awarded for QTc values
exceeding 450 ms in males and 460 ms in females.
A QTc value greater than 480 ms is worth 3
points.14
Unfortunately, this simple tool conceals the
inherent difficulties with diagnosing this disease
where, for example, the clinical presentation can
masquerade as epilepsy. Further, a significant
component of the score, namely the ECG index
of cardiac repolarisation known as the QTc, can be
computed erroneously by the ECG system or
miscalculated by the physician performing his/her
independent calculation. In fact, Viskin et al15
demonstrated that the QTc was calculated incor￾rectly (when compared with LQTS experts) by
one-third of heart rhythm specialists and by nearly
three-quarters of cardiologists.
Even when the correct QTc value has been
obtained, its diagnostic significance can be mis￾interpreted, particularly when the value triggers
the infamous designation of ‘‘borderline QT
prolongation’’ (ie, QTc >440 ms). At present,
nearly half of the patients seen at our institution
for a second opinion of a previously rendered
diagnosis of LQTS are departing without such a
diagnosis.16 Here, the majority of diagnostic rever￾sals stem from miscalculated QTc values or the
premature assignment of an LQTS diagnosis in the
setting of low clinical probability scenarios (nega￾tive personal and family history) but with a
‘‘borderline’’ QTc.16 17
Although the diagnosis may be relatively simple
and readily apparent in a patient with a QTc
persistently greater than 500 ms (especially if
accompanied by typical LQTS-triggered cardiac
events), primary care physicians and cardiologists
are often confronted with patients diagnosed with
‘‘borderline’’ LQTS. These patients may or may
not have an LQTS-specific history or complaint
and have received an ECG for a variety of
indications including screening pre-participation
ECGs. The diagnosis of ‘‘borderline’’ QT prolonga￾tion or even ‘‘borderline LQTS’’ is commonly given
when a patient has a QTc value between 440 and
470 ms.18 Within this range, however, there exists a
significant ‘‘overlap zone’’, an area in which it is
not possible to decipher whether or not a patient
truly has LQTS simply on the basis of an ECG
(fig 1). Indeed, fully 15% of the general population
may have a QTc in the ‘‘borderline range’’.16 On
the other hand, however, 25–35% of patients

harbouring an LQTS-causing mutation have a QTc ,440 ms
and have been termed ‘‘silent carriers’’ or ‘‘concealed LQTS’’.19–21
From this significant overlap, it is easy to appreciate why LQTS
can be both overdiagnosed and underdiagnosed.
MEASUREMENT OF QTC: PITFALLS AND POINTERS
As mentioned above, central to the assessment of a 12-lead ECG
is the ability to accurately measure the QTc. Computer-derived
measurements are fraught with errors, particularly in patients
with complex T-wave and U-wave arrangements.16 22 As such,
physicians-in-training should be taught that the computer’s
QTc cannot be relied upon when a diagnosis of LQTS is in
question and, must be verified manually. Complicating this
recommendation, however, is the sobering observation from
Viskin et al15 on the ability of cardiologists to accurately conduct
this independent verification.
The QT interval is defined as the time duration between the
onset of the QRS complex and the end of the T wave as it
returns to baseline (fig 2), ideally measured using either lead II
or lead V5 of the 12-lead ECG. There are no standards for
interpreting prolonged QT intervals from Holter or 24/48 h
ambulatory monitoring records; the ‘‘normal’’ QTc distribution
at 2:30 am, for example, is not known, and thus QTc assessment
by ambulatory monitoring is not recommended at present to
invoke a diagnosis of LQTS.16 Regarding the 12-lead ECG,
‘‘normal’’ QTc values are generally considered to be between
350 and 440 ms,18 23 but, as will be discussed in the next section,
this consideration of QTc .440 ms as indicative of ‘‘borderline
QT prolongation’’ has probably been responsible for the
greatest number of premature LQTS diagnostic renderings
than the intrinsic fragility in the computation of the QTc in
the first place.
Numerous methodologies for correcting QT intervals for
heart rate have been proposed,24–26 but the most universally
utilised method is that described by Bazett in 1920.27 Bazett
calculated the QTc as the QT interval divided by the square root
of the preceding RR interval. At normal heart rates, this formula
is clinically useful, but begins to underestimate and over￾estimate the duration of cardiac repolarisation at extreme low
and high heart rates, respectively.17 In the presence of sinus
arrhythmia, the interpreting physician should calculate an
average QTc from analysis of the entire 12-lead ECG rhythm
strip.28 Although Martin et al29 have proposed an alternative
method in which the interpreter would apply Bazett’s formula
to the QT interval following the shortest available RR interval,
this is strongly discouraged as it will result in a marked
inflation/overestimation of the QTc and lead to overdiagnosis.
In contrast, using only the longest RR interval may under￾estimate the repolarisation index.
The U wave is a common ECG finding, especially among
adolescents, that is often a source of consternation for
physicians reading ECGs. Most LQTS specialists recommend
that a U wave distinctly separate from and much smaller than
the preceding T wave must be excluded from the QT interval
measurement.23 Inclusion of such U waves can easily ‘‘inflate’’

the QTc by 80–200 ms and unnecessarily precipitate a diagnosis
of LQTS.16
To avoid mistakes in measurement of atypical T waves, many
specialists recommend a method where the end of the T wave is
considered to be the intersection of the tangent to the steepest
slope of the last limb of the T wave and the baseline (fig 3).22 30
This ‘‘teach-the-tangent’’, or as we refer to it ‘‘avoid-the-tail’’
method, was taught to a cohort of 151 medical students, who
achieved higher accuracy of diagnosis (77%) than previously
described cohorts of non-cardiologists (21%), cardiologists (22%)
and even electrophysiologists (62%).15 22 Importantly, the accuracy
of diagnosis was 96% for cardiologists specialising in LQTS.15 22
Finally, one must keep in mind that the QTc is not the only
finding available on the 12-lead ECG. Specific T-wave and ST￾segment findings can give clues to the astute clinician as to the
presence of pathological disease, particularly the presence of T￾wave alternans or diffuse T-wave notching (fig 4).31 As such, the
ECG must be examined critically for not only the length of the
QT interval but also the look of the T-wave and T/U-wave
morphologies.
CONFOUNDERS
The QT interval is a fluid measurement that is influenced by the
physiological and metabolic state of the patient at the time of
the ECG. Owing to multiple variables interacting at any given
time, patients may have different QT intervals during sub￾sequent ECG examinations. The full extent of personal
variability of the QT interval is currently unknown. For these
reasons, use of specific QT interval cut-off values must be
interpreted in the context of specific clinical information. For
example, among the diagnostic reversals that we have encoun￾tered to date, 10% involved patients who had been referred after
presenting to an emergency department with an episode of pre￾syncope or syncope (typically vasovagal in description) where
their first ever ECG demonstrated a ‘‘borderline’’ QT interval.
In addition, structural heart disease can play a significant role
in altering the QT interval.18 Obtaining an exact measurement is
particularly difficult in patients with left or right bundle branch
block, found commonly in patients with a surgical history of
congenital heart disease.32 Left ventricular hypertrophy may
prolong the QT interval in the absence of known ion channel
disease.33 The presence of infarction or ischaemia in adults may
also prolong the QT interval independently.34 Electrolyte abnorm￾alities such as hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia and hypocalcae￾mia can lengthen the QT interval, whereas hypercalcaemia may
shorten the QT interval.35 Prolonged QT intervals have been found
in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis and are associated with the
level of ketosis, even in the absence of electrolyte abnormalities.36
Patients with anorexia nervosa have longer QT intervals than
controls with normal body weight.37 Finally, the QTc of normal
subjects has been shown to demonstrate diurnal variation (longer
during sleep and during REM sleep in particular),38 39 and the QTc
in otherwise healthy men is significantly longer in winter months
than summer months.40
Numerous drugs have been well documented to prolong the
QT interval as an unwanted side effect.41 The presence of these
drugs must be ruled out during the workup for LQTS, and they
should be avoided as a rule when a diagnosis of LQTS is
considered. An up-to-date list of these drugs is available at
http://www.qtdrugs.org.
QT INTERVALS IN ATHLETES
The prevalence of QT interval prolongation in asymptomatic
elite athletes was recently reported as 0.4%, or 1 in 286
patients.30 Of the positive patients in this study, only the three
with QT intervals over 500 ms had either a positive provocation
test or positive genetic test, and were thus excluded from
participating in their sport. Four other patients with QTc values
between 460 and 500 ms were studied further, but not
disqualified from their sport because of negative family histories
and negative provocative testing. A 2006 publication on the
Italian pre-participation screening programme reported disqua￾lification of 2% of all athletes on the basis of screening, with
only five athletes out of 42 386 ultimately diagnosed with
LQTS.42 The majority of disqualifications in the Italian cohort
were for cardiomyopathy, hypertension, valvular disease and
non-LQTS rhythm abnormalities.42 In each of these studies, the
European guideline cut-off values for diagnosing prolonged QT
were used: 440 ms for males and 460 ms for females.43
The 36th Bethesda Conference guidelines were published in
2005 and established recommendations for athletic activity
restrictions in patients with LQTS.44 A near-all-encompassing
competitive sports disqualification was advised for any patient
with a history of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest or LQTS-related
syncopal episode, regardless of underlying genotype or QTc. For
asymptomatic patients, a QTc of >470 ms in males or >480 ms
in females was the recommended limitation to only class IA
sports of billiards, bowling, cricket, curling, golf and riflery, with
further liberalisation possible if the asymptomatic patient had
the LQT3 genotype. A loosening of the competitive sports
disqualifications was deemed reasonable for asymptomatic
genotype-positive LQTS patients with QTc values in the
overlapping/borderline range, except for competitive swimming
in athletes with concealed LQT1.44
The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) in 2006 also
published a set of athletic activity guidelines for patients with
LQTS.45 Patients were recommended to be completely restricted
from participating in competitive sports if they were sympto￾matic, had a prolonged QT interval (over 440–470 ms in men,
over 460–480 ms in women), or were carriers of a known

genetic mutation (regardless of their QTc). Patients considered
at low risk of sudden death were allowed to participate in light
to moderate leisure activity. Any sports involving sudden bursts
of activity or genotype-specific triggers were absolutely contra￾indicated in patients with LQTS. Again, in contrast with the
Bethesda guidelines, the recommendation for competitive sports
restriction was unchanged for genotype-positive patients with
normal or borderline QT values.45
As is evident, there are profound implications of hosting QTc
values that are awarded 1, 2 or 3 points in the LQTS diagnostic
score card and consequently convey ‘‘intermediate’’ probability
for LQTS (table 1). However, what truly is the predictive utility
of say a QTc of 450 ms in an otherwise healthy man or a QTc of
470 ms, or dare we say, 480 ms or even 490 ms, in a healthy
woman? As we shall see, clinical context and pretest probability
mean everything.
HOW LONG IS TOO LONG?
As seen in fig 1, there is substantial overlap in the distribution of
QTc between otherwise healthy subjects and patients with
genetically confirmed LQTS. Among patients seen with
genetically proven LQTS at the Mayo Clinic, the mean (SD)
QTc is 482 (50) ms and, at present, ranges from 365 ms as the
lowest value in a patient with genetically definite LQT1 to a
high of 800 ms. Consistent with the published literature, 40% of
our genotyped LQTS population exhibit QTc values ,460 ms.
However, this prevalence of concealed or normal QT interval￾LQTS must be juxtaposed carefully with the normal distribu￾tion of QTc values, including the prevalence of normal people
who simply exhibit ‘‘upper limit of normal’’ QTc values. In
other words, there are a lot more normal people with high
normal, upper limit of normal, borderline QT prolongation than
there are people with a 1 in 2500 condition known as LQTS
where half of them have a QTc ,480 ms. This important
subtlety appears to have been overlooked given the current
mini-epidemic of overdiagnosed LQTS.16 In fact, when the
original LQTS diagnostic criteria were published in 1985, a
diagnostic cut-off QTc value of 440 ms was used, regardless of
patient age or gender.46 The criteria were updated in 1993 to
now award 1 point to a male with a QTc of 450 ms and 2 points
to both males and females when a QTc of 460 ms is reached.14
This gender differentiation was added after adult women were
found to have longer QTc values than men by ,10 ms.47
Nevertheless, any person with a QTc >460 ms receives 2 points
in the LQTS diagnostic score card, which is translated as
‘‘intermediate probability’’ for LQTS. As we will see, this
clinical assignment of ‘‘intermediate probability’’ is only valid if
one accepts a 2% chance of LQTS as indicative of ‘‘intermediate
probability’’.
Several recent reviews have proposed an ‘‘upper limit’’ of
460 ms in patients ,15 years of age, 470 ms for adult females,
and 450 ms for adult males.17 23 In this algorithm, any QTc value
within 20 ms of these designated upper limits is considered
‘‘borderline’’.23 Consequently, an adult male with a QTc of
431 ms is considered by these criteria to exhibit ‘‘borderline’’
QT prolongation. Others have proposed that any patient with a
QTc between 440 and 470 ms be labelled ‘‘borderline.’’18 A 2005
European protocol proposed the use of a QTc value greater than
440 ms in males and 460 ms in females as a definition of a
‘‘prolonged’’ QTc.30 43 Even the latest 2009 AHA/ACCF/HRS
Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation
of the Electrocardiogram states that a QTc >450 ms (males)
and >460 ms (females) ‘‘be considered a prolonged QT
interval’’.48
With respect to ‘‘borderline’’, although the literature cites the
‘‘normal range’’ as being 350–440 ms, it is often not recognised
that 10–20% of otherwise healthy postpubertal individuals have
QTc values beyond this so-called ‘‘normal range’’ (fig 1). In
Figure 5 Effect of clinical setting on the relative probability of having long QT syndrome (LQTS). Note the relatively low predictive value of a QTc
.440 ms in any asymptomatic patient compared with the patient with personal symptoms or a family history suggestive of LQTS. TdP, torsades

other words, 10–20% of the human population has ‘‘borderline
QT prolongation’’ per any of the aforementioned definitions,
guidelines or cut-offs. As shown in fig 1, 0.5–1% of men and
women in the adult human population receive at least 2 points
and a clinical diagnostic score indicative of ‘‘intermediate
probability’’ LQTS.
Figure 5 depicts the critical importance of context in the
determination of when ‘‘long is too long’’. There would be little
debate as to the near-100% pretest probability of LQTS for
someone with documented torsades de pointes while swimming
and a QTc of 500 ms. On the other hand, there would be
tremendous debate as to the probability of LQTS in an
asymptomatic, postpubertal female with a QTc of 481 ms. By
the LQTS diagnostic score card, 3 points and ‘‘intermediate
probability’’ would be assigned. By the ESC 2006 position
statement, she would be disqualified from all sports regardless
of symptomatic state. However, if such a QTc value represents
the 99–99.5th centile among women, this stand-alone value
confers a positive predictive value for LQTS of ,5%. If such a
QTc cut-off value (480 ms) were adopted as part of a universal
screen for females (470 ms for males), 20–25 people could be
prematurely and incorrectly diagnosed with LQTS for every
single person where this screening ECG exposed LQTS in an
otherwise asymptomatic host. Again, everything is context
dependent, as these same cut-off values applied to universal
screening of infants instead of postpubertal adults might have
positive predictive values approaching 50%.49 50
Now consider the 440 ms threshold that is still held in some
circles as worthy of receiving ‘‘borderline QT prolongation’’,
which unfortunately is almost always incorrectly and quickly
translated as ‘‘borderline LQTS’’. As shown in figs 1 and 5, this
value is achieved or exceeded by 2.5% of 4-day-old infants51 and
by 10–20% of postpubertal adults. Accordingly, an adult
woman with no personal or family history suggestive of
LQTS has ,0.1% probability of LQTS simply because her
screening ECG registered a QTc of 443 ms. In sharp contrast, an
equally asymptomatic teenage athlete with the same QTc who
is the offspring of a mother with A341V-KCNQ1-mediated
LQT1 has a 50% chance (not ,0.1% chance) of inheriting her
mother’s LQT1-susceptibility mutation and may have LQTS.
CONCLUSIONS
Primary care physicians and cardiologists are often confronted
with patients who exhibit ‘‘upper limit of normal’’ or ‘‘border￾line QT prolongation’’ and then give the diagnosis of ‘‘possible/
borderline’’ LQTS. The extreme overlap in this index of cardiac
repolarisation between patients with genetically established
LQTS and otherwise healthy subjects emphasises the critical
importance of considering the whole clinical picture and the
various diagnostic modalities besides the 12-lead ECG to
distinguish the person who has a highly treatable, potentially
life-threatening condition known as LQTS from the one whose
QTc is just ‘‘borderline’’ just because.
Authors’ recommendations
1. If an ECG is ordered to ‘‘rule out’’ LQTS, the computer￾derived QTc must be manually verified. If the manually
derived QT interval is within 10 ms of the computer’s QT
interval by either the ‘‘tangential’’ or ‘‘avoid-the-tail’’ method,
one can be confident that the computer knows how to
compute the average RR interval, use the heart rate
correction formula, and generate an accurate QTc.
2. All manually measured QTc values must be interpreted in
the context of the patient’s personal and family history.
3. A ‘‘borderline’’ QTc value is not sufficient evidence for a
diagnosis of LQTS or even borderline/possible LQTS.
4. In a patient with a personal or family history suspicious for
LQTS (exercise-induced syncope/seizures for example),
further work-up for LQTS including treadmill exercise stress
testing and/or epinephrine QT stress testing, and genetic
testing should be considered even if the QTc is ‘‘borderline’’
or possibly even normal. In other words, the story should
drive the depth and aggressiveness of the evaluation not the
12-lead ECG. However, exercise-induced syncope in the
context of a QTc ,460 ms is far more likely to stem from
catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia than
from concealed type 1 LQTS.
5. As a potentially lethal, highly treatable condition affecting 1
in 2500 people, LQTS certainly warrants consideration of
not only pre-participation athlete screening but also
universal screening. From a screening perspective, a QTc
value >470 ms for a 2–4-week-old infant screening
programme or a QTc >500 ms in adolescents/adults may
represent far more optimal ‘‘penalty box’’ screening values
with an estimated positive predictive value .50%. Such a
screen would produce far fewer subsequent evaluations
needed to distinguish the true positives from the false
positives while capturing the subpopulation of LQTS most at
risk of a future LQTS-precipitated cardiac event.
Furthermore, subsequent genetic testing of these positively
screened index cases would identify their LQTS￾susceptibility mutation over 75% of the time, thereby
permitting genetic testing of appropriate family members,
which would enable a large proportion of the subpopulation
of lower risk, normal QT interval/borderline QT interval/
concealed LQTS to be essentially ‘‘back-filled.’’
What is already known on this topic
c Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a potentially lethal yet highly
treatable genetic heart rhythm disorder (‘‘cardiac
channelopathy’’) that affects an estimated 1 in 2500 people.
c Investigators have searched for simple non-invasive methods
to aid in the diagnostic elucidation and risk stratification of
patients with suspected LQTS.
c Despite significant advances in our understanding of its
pathogenic underpinnings, genotype–phenotype relationships
and therapeutic strategies, LQTS still remains both
underdiagnosed and overdiagnosed.
What this study adds
c Whereas many authors have attempted to pick a specific ‘‘cut￾off’’ QTc value for athletic disqualification and risk
stratification, this study emphasises that all QTc
measurements should be interpreted in the context of the
patient’s personal and family history.
c More importantly, the age-dependent and sex-dependent
normal distribution of this particular index of repolarisation
(QTc) in both health and disease must be kept in sharp focus.
