Iron deficiency is the most common form of nutrient deficiency worldwide. It is highly
prevalent due to the limited availability of high quality food in developing countries and
poor dietary habits in industrialized countries. According to the World Health Organization,
it affects nearly 2 billion people and up to 50% of women who are pregnant. Maternal
anemia during pregnancy is especially burdensome to healthy neurodevelopment in the
fetus because iron is needed for proper neurogenesis, development, and myelination.
Maternal anemia also increases the risk of low birth weight, either due to premature birth
or fetal growth restriction, which is associated with delayed neurocognitive development
and even psychiatric illness. As rapid neurodevelopment continues after birth infants
that received sufficient iron in utero, but that receive a low iron diet after 6 months of
age, also show deficits in neurocognitive development, including impairments in learning
and memory. Unfortunately, the neurocognitive complications of iron deficiency during
critical pre- and postnatal periods of brain development are difficult to remedy, persisting
into adulthood. Thus, preventing iron deficiency in the pre- and postnatal periods is
critical as is devising new means to recapture cognitive function in individuals who
experienced early iron deficiency. This review will discuss the prevalence of pre- and
postnatal iron deficiency, the mechanism, and effects of iron deficiency on brain and
cognitive development.

INTRODUCTION
Iron deficiency is the primary cause of anemia, which affects
roughly one-quarter of the world’s population (McLean et al.,
2009). As the most prevalent micronutrient deficiency in the
world, iron deficiency affects all age groups, with the most
common being children between the ages of 0 and 5 years
(McLean et al., 2009). It was previously thought that neonates
were protected from iron deficiency, in all but the most
severe cases of maternal anemia, due to mobilization of iron
stores accumulated in utero (Allen, 2000). However, it is now
documented that even mild iron deficiency in the mother reduces
iron stores in the fetus, resulting in a neonatal iron-deficient
condition (Rao and Georgieff, 2002). Neonatal iron deficiency is
also greater in infants born prematurely or of a diabetic mother
(Lozoff et al., 2006). As the incidence of both these conditions
is increasing worldwide (Beck et al., 2010; Martin et al., 2010;
Danaei et al., 2011), it is likely that iron deficiency in infants will
become an even greater concern in the future.
The impact of perinatal iron deficiency on human brain and
cognitive development is of particular interest because the brain
growth spurt that begins in the last one-third of pregnancy
continues the first 2 years after birth due to dendritic growth,
synaptogenesis, and glial cell proliferation (Courchesne et al.,
2000; Gogtay et al., 2006). Neurogenesis in the hippocampal
dentate gyrus also persists in the neonatal period (and throughout
adulthood), and recent evidence indicates lingering neurogenesis
in different cortical regions, including the prefrontal cortex in
human infants (Sanai et al., 2011; Feliciano and Bordey, 2012).
Total brain volume doubles the first year and reaches 80–90% of
adult volume by age two (Knickmeyer et al., 2008). This phase of
rapid growth represents a sensitive period, wherein environmen￾tal insults alter neurodevelopment (McEwen, 1999).
One such insult is iron deficiency. The hippocampus, a brain
area important in learning, memory, and cognition, is highly
susceptible to iron deficiency during the late fetal and early
neonatal time period. For example, iron deficiency in the perinatal
period is associated with altered expression of genes critical for
hippocampal development and function (Carlson et al., 2007).
Moreover, early iron deficiency causes neurocognitive dysfunction
both during deficiency and after repletion (Beard and Connor,
2003; Jorgenson et al., 2005). Thus, preventing iron deficiency in
the perinatal period is critical as is devising new means to recap￾ture cognitive function in individuals who experienced early iron
deficiency. Although iron deficiency is a major concern across the
lifespan, this review will focus on the prevalence of pre- and post￾natal iron deficiency, perinatal iron homeostasis, and the effects
of perinatal iron deficiency on brain and cognitive development.
PREVALENCE OF IRON DEFICIENCY AND IRON DEFICIENCY
ANEMIA
Of all micronutrient deficiencies, iron deficiency is most prevalent
worldwide. It affects all age groups and demographics; however,

Radlowski and Johnson Perinatal iron deficiency and neurocognitive development
prevalence is higher in pubescent women, pregnant women,
infants and preschool-age children. Rates of anemia in non￾pregnant women of childbearing age reach approximately 40%
in developing countries and 20% in industrialized countries
(McLean et al., 2009). The incidence of iron deficiency anemia
increases further during pregnancy, with rates in developing and
industrialized countries reaching 59% and 24%, respectively. The
large increase in iron deficiency in pregnant women in developing
countries may be due to poor nutrition education and lack of
iron supplements (Pasricha et al., 2013).
Infants born full term with an appropriate weight for gestation
have iron stores that are adequate for about 6 months. This is
vital because the neonatal gut is developmentally immature and
infants are unable to regulate iron absorption until 6–9 months
of age (Domellöf et al., 2002). Furthermore, iron content of
breast milk is very low (approximately 35–40 µg/dL). Although
information on iron deficiency in infants less than 1 year of age
is lacking, the Pediatric Nutrition Surveillance System (PedNSS)
reported hemoglobin in a national sample of infants from families
participating in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program
for Women, Infants, and Children (i.e., Supplemental Nutrition
Assistance Program (SNAP; Polhamus et al., 2004)). In 2003,
16.2% of infants aged 6–11 months, and 15% of children aged 12–
17 months qualified as having iron deficiency anemia (Polhamus
et al., 2004). In a Brazilian community, iron deficiency anemia
in infants (average age 11.6 months) reached nearly 26% (Kon￾stantyner et al., 2012); and in Canada, the rate of iron deficiency
anemia in Cree Indian infants (average age 9 months) was nearly
32% (Willows et al., 2000). Sadly, in most countries including the
U.S., the occurrence of iron deficiency worsens in preschool-aged
children (CDC, 2011; see Table 1).
MATERNAL IRON DEFICIENCY AND IRON DEFICIENCY ANEMIA:
EFFECTS ON NEONATAL IRON STATUS
As iron is concerned, the developing fetus was once considered
a “perfect parasite,” able to acquire sufficient iron from the
mother even when she was iron deficient (Young et al., 2012).
This notion has fallen by the wayside, however, and it is now
clear that neonatal iron stores can be compromised when the
mother is iron deficient or anemic. For example, under steady￾state conditions serum ferritin concentration correlates with total
body iron stores. New born infants from iron deficient mothers
with low serum ferritin levels also had low serum ferritin indi￾cating there is a limited capacity for the fetus to accumulate iron
from low maternal stores (Jaime-Perez et al., 2005). Gestational
iron deficiency also appears to have a programming effect on
the physiologic mechanisms responsible for iron homeostasis
resulting in offspring that are more likely to develop iron defi￾ciency in the future regardless of adequate nutrition (De Pee et al.,
2002; Georgieff et al., 2002; Emamghorashi and Heidari, 2004.
Multiple studies have shown that iron status in infants born to
iron deficient mothers is still abnormally low 9 months after birth
despite being provided adequate dietary iron (Georgieff et al.,
2002; Geltman et al., 2004).
The timing of iron deficiency during pregnancy is critical.
First, there is an important need for iron early in pregnancy
for neural development. In a recent study in rats, four dietary￾feeding regimens were used to render the developing fetuses iron
deficient at different stages of gestation. Maternal iron restriction
beginning prior to conception and during the first one-third of
pregnancy was associated with embryonic iron deficiency, postna￾tal anemia, reduced iron levels in the central nervous system, and
decreased neural conduction velocities in an auditory brainstem
response test conducted at postnatal day 45 (Mihaila et al., 2011).
Importantly, the functional neural impairments were not induced
when maternal iron restriction was initiated at the beginning
of the last one-third of pregnancy. It’s also noteworthy that in
this study, the mothers were not anemic; indicating poorly timed
iron deficiency is sufficient to disrupt neural development and
function. Second, as the fetal liver continues to grow, most (>
66%) of the infants total body iron is acquired during the third
trimester of pregnancy (Allen, 2000). Hence, infants born preterm
and/or low birth weight have poorer iron stores and are a high risk
population for iron deficiency (Scholl, 2011).
IRON HOMEOSTASIS IN THE BRAIN OF INFANTS
After 6 months of age, the blood-brain barrier is a major control
point for the entry of iron into the brain, although the choroid
plexus (the vasculature responsible for producing cerebrospinal
fluid) is also a location of regulation for iron entry (Beard and
Connor, 2003). The blood-brain barrier is important, as it pre￾vents the brain from having direct access to the iron in the blood
plasma, allowing for greater regulation (Piñero and Connor,
2000). Transferrin (Tf) receptors are present on the endothelial
cells that make up the blood-brain barrier to allow for the binding
and endocytosis of transferrin-bound iron into the brain (Beard,
2001). The rate of iron entry into the brain is increased during
iron deficiency (Taylor et al., 1991), which is due to an increased
amount of Tf receptors present on the cells of the blood-brain
barrier (van Gelder et al., 1998), as well as a possible role for
regulation by astrocytes (Beard and Connor, 2003).

Radlowski and Johnson Perinatal iron deficiency and neurocognitive development
In the newborn infant, the story is a bit different. At birth, the
blood-brain barrier is incompletely developed: it prevents iron
transport proteins from diffusing into the brain but it lacks the
ability to transfer iron from the blood into the brain parenchyma
(Collard, 2009). Studies done in rat pups showed that iron reg￾ulatory proteins, which are involved with the regulation of Tf
receptor, were not readily expressed until post-natal day 15, when
peak myelination occurs in the rat (Siddappa et al., 2002). It is
not known for human infants when the blood-brain barrier fully
matures, but it has been estimated to occur by 6 months of age
(Rice and Barone, 2000). During prenatal development iron accu￾mulates in the brain so levels are highest immediately after birth
(Siddappa et al., 2003). Due to poor bioavailability and low levels
of iron in human breast milk, infant brain iron concentration
decreases the first 6 months after birth, until the gastrointestinal
tract and blood-brain barrier mature and are able to absorb
dietary iron and regulate its entry into the brain, respectively. This
coincides with the onset of myelination and an increase in trans￾ferring mRNA levels in brain (Connor et al., 1987; Connor and
Menzies, 1996; Roncagliolo et al., 1998). Since oligodendrocytes
synthesize Tf, the brain is the only organ in which Tf mRNA
increases post-natally (Bloch et al., 1985). The developmental
timeline for mechanisms responsible for iron homeostasis under￾score the importance of maternal iron status during pregnancy.
Once iron penetrates the blood-brain barrier, much less is
known about how it is distributed to different brain regions. Most
likely Tf (secreted by the choroid plexus, which is another point
of regulation) is the primary method for the distribution of iron
in the brain (Beard, 2001); however, it is also possible for iron to
be transported by binding to ferritin (Piñero and Connor, 2000).
The iron can then be taken up by cells in various brain regions
that express receptors for Tf and/or ferritin, with the expression
of these receptors as the mechanism of regulation (Beard and
Connor, 2003). This leads to an uneven distribution of iron
between the various brain regions, which changes throughout
the lifetime (Beard, 2001). In general, the globus pallidus, red
nucleus, substantia nigra, and caudate putamen have higher iron
concentrations throughout life, and the brain tends to accumulate
iron with age (Piñero and Connor, 2000).
NEUROCOGNITIVE DEFICITS RESULTING FROM PERINATAL IRON
DEFICIENCY
One of the first studies to look at the effect of iron deficiency on
cognition in humans used the Bayley Scales of Infant Develop￾ment, which assess motor, language, and cognitive development
in infants and toddlers, and compared 9–26 month old infants
who were given iron supplements to those given a placebo. Each
group was tested and then re-tested within 8 days of the initial
exam. The results showed an improved scores within the Mental
Development Index for the iron supplemented group (Oski and
Honig, 1978), which resulted in a surge of interest in this topic
(Yehuda et al., 2010). Many different studies have looked at iron
deficiency during various times of development; however, the
most sensitive period (and the period that can cause the most
irreversible damage) is the neonatal period, which is between 0
and 24 months of age (Pollitt, 1993). Although supplementation
with iron has been shown to correct some of the cognitive deficits
during this period, lower I.Q. and achievement test scores have
still been found after treatment (Lozoff, 1989).
Many studies have investigated the impact of neonatal iron
status at various times during this critical period and the effects
that decreased iron levels have on cognition. In Papua New
Guinea, infants who were given an iron dextran shot at 2 months
of age had longer attention spans at 1 year of age when compared
to control (Heywood et al., 1989). A study done in Costa Rica
found that infants who had lower iron levels scored lower in the
Bayley Scales of Infant Development tests in both cognitive and
motor skill tests (Lozoff, 1989). In Guatemala, researchers found
that an intramuscular injection of iron dextran improved Bayley
Scales of Infant Development test scores in babies 6–24 months
old after just one week, while oral supplementation did not show
an effect within the week studied (Lozoff et al., 1982). In Chile,
infants 3 months of age, were given either iron fortified formula or
control diet for 12 months (Walter et al., 1983). At the conclusion
of the diet intervention, Bayley Scales of Infant Development were
administered. After the initial test, all infants received a trial of
orally administered ferrous sulfate daily and then retested within
15 days (Walter et al., 1983). A similar relationship between low
iron levels and lower Bayley Scales of Infant Development scores
was found (Walter et al., 1983). Studies in Indonesia found that 8
weeks of oral supplementation of iron in anemic preschool aged
children reduced deficits in visual attention and concept acquisi￾tion compared to children who were not given supplementation
(Soewondo et al., 1989). Also in Indonesia, when 12–18 month
old infants that were diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia
were given an oral iron intervention, Bayley Scales of Infant
Development scores significantly improved compared to those
given a placebo, even after only 4 months of supplementation
(Idjradinata and Pollitt, 1993). Nine and twelve month old infants
were tested for their ability to discriminate a highly familiar
stimulus, their mother’s face, from a stranger’s face using an elec￾troencephalogram (Burden et al., 2007). At 9 months infants that
were iron sufficient showed greater attentional response to the
mother’s face and greater updating of memory to the stranger’s
face, while iron deficient infants did not show this response until
12 months of age, suggesting a delay in cognitive development
(Burden et al., 2007). It has also been demonstrated that infants
with low serum ferritin concentrations have abnormal auditory
recognition memory (Siddappa et al., 2004). The infants in this
study did not discriminate a familiar stimulus (mother’s voice)
from a novel stimulus (stranger’s voice) with the same vehemence
as an iron sufficient infant (Siddappa et al., 2004). These findings
suggest abnormalities in structures that mediate recognition and
memory function, including the hippocampus (Georgieff, 2008).
Being iron deficient at birth seems to cause long term deficits as
well. Five year old children, who were born either iron deficient,
scored lower on tests of language ability, fine-motor skills, and
tractability, when compared to children who were iron sufficient
at birth (Tamura et al., 2002). In Israel, it was found that children
who were born premature and had low ferritin levels at birth
performed significantly worse on tests involving spatial cognition
and processing of auditory signals when tested at 9 to 10 years of
age, even though their hemoglobin levels had returned to normal
(Armony-Sivan et al., 2004; Yehuda and Yehuda, 2006). Another

Radlowski and Johnson Perinatal iron deficiency and neurocognitive development
study showed similar results in that Costa Rican teens that were
severely iron deficient during infancy, despite resolution of ane￾mia while an infant, showed deficits when given neurocognitive
tests (Trail Making test, Intra-Extra-dimensional Shift, Stockings
of Cambridge, Spatial Working Memory, Rapid Visual Informa￾tion Processing, Pattern Recognition Memory, and Spatial Recog￾nition Memory) at the age of 19 years old, when compared to
teens that were iron sufficient during infancy (Lukowski et al.,
2010).
Of course, studies in animals have greatly advanced the knowl￾edge of iron deficiency and its effects on cognitive performance.
The fact that the avoidance response is affected by iron deficiency
was one of the first cognitive aspects studied in rodents. Rats
placed on an iron deficient diet at an early age showed deficits
in both passive avoidance, where the rat had to inhibit its activity
(i.e., not leave a platform and enter a chamber) in order to avoid
shock, and active avoidance (i.e., where rats had to move into
another chamber of the testing area in order to avoid shock)
(Weinberg et al., 1979, 1981). Fear conditioning (as measured by
heart rate deceleration in a cage where the rat had been shocked
previously, as well as exposure to a tone that was played during
the shock in a novel cage) was also impaired in iron deficient rats
(McEchron et al., 2005).
Iron deficient diets also resulted in cognitive deficits in the
Morris Water Maze, a hippocampal-dependent task which
requires the rat to develop a spatial map of the area surrounding
the pool in order to reach a hidden platform (Yehuda and
Youdim, 1989). Similar deficits were observed in a water Y-maze
(where the rat had two choices and a dry platform was placed at
the end of the arm of the correct choice as a reward), including
increased incorrect arm entries and a longer time to reach the
platform (Yehuda et al., 1986), both of which indicate cognitive
deficits. A recent study with piglets also demonstrated the effects
of early-life iron deficiency on hippocampal-dependent learning
(Rytych et al., 2012). Neonatal piglets placed on liquid diets of
varying iron content (adequate, mildly deficient, and a severely
deficient) 2 days after birth underwent repeated cognitive testing
beginning about 2-weeks later using a T-maze task to measure
spatial learning and memory. Severely iron deficient piglets were
not able to successfully learn the task, while mildly deficient
piglets took longer to learn compared to controls. In addition
to poor performance, both sets of iron deficient piglets had less
iron present in the hippocampus compared to controls (Rytych
et al., 2012). These rodent and piglet studies confirmed that the
magnitude of the cognitive effects observed correlated with the
duration and severity of the iron deficiency.
The timing of iron deficiency during the perinatal period can
also affect learning and memory. A pre-natal, post-natal, and
pre+post-natal iron deficiency paradigm was used with mice pups
to examine the effects of iron deficiency on learning and memory
(Ranade et al., 2013). Mice pups that were pre-natal iron deficient
or pre+ post-natal iron deficient performed poorly in a radial
arm maze task; performance was better for pups in the post-natal
deficient group, although their performance did not match that
of pups provided adequate iron in both the pre- and postnatal
periods. Even when pre-natal iron deficient pups became iron suf￾ficient after birth, they still exhibited a poor ability to utilize refer￾ence memory, suggesting the hippocampus is highly vulnerable to
iron deficiency in the pre-natal period (Ranade et al., 2013). How￾ever, the fact that performance of the post-natal iron deficient
group was intermediate to the other iron deficient groups and
control confirms that the window of vulnerability to iron defi￾ciency for the hippocampus does not close immediately at birth.
Iron deficiency decreases brain iron concentration, which leads
to numerous behavioral symptoms, such as irritability, apathy,
reduced ability to concentrate, and other cognitive deficits (Piñero
and Connor, 2000) (Table 2). Other important behavioral prob￾lems have been reported in association with iron deficiency as
well. For example, children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity
Disorder (ADHD) were found to have lower levels of serum
ferritin, an indication of reduced iron storage (Konofal et al.,
2004). Iron-deficient animals develop ADHD-like behavior that
has been linked to the dopaminergic system (Lahat et al., 2011).
Deficits in motor development are also a symptom of iron defi￾ciency in the neonate. In addition to cognitive development, the
Bayley Scales of Infant Development also assesses fine and gross
motor skills. Numerous studies (Lozoff et al., 1982; Walter et al.,
1983; Lozoff, 1989; Idjradinata and Pollitt, 1993) indicate iron
deficiency is associated with poorer scores in the motor function
assessment within of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development.
Further, anemic infants had low Mental and Psychomotor Devel￾opment Index scores, even after 3 months of iron therapy. The
anemic infants also showed deficits in language capability and
coordination (Walter et al., 1989). In rodents, iron deficiency is
associated with delayed development of surface righting, bar hold,
forelimb placing, and negative geotaxis (Beard et al., 2006).
IRON UTILIZATION WITHIN THE BRAIN
So what are some potential mechanisms underlying iron
deficiency-related deficits in cognition? Iron is important
for erythropoiesis, formation of hemoglobin and myoglobin,
gene transcription, cellular enzyme reactions, and important
oxidation-reduction actions (Lieu et al., 2001). All of these, of
course, are important for proper brain function, so it is not
surprising that iron deficiency results in behavioral disorders
and deficits in learning and memory (Rao and Georgieff, 2007).
In humans, the hippocampus matures most rapidly over a
short period of time: from late gestation to 2–3 years of age.
During this period, there is an increase in iron uptake and
utilization as well as neurogenesis, dendrite growth, myelination,
synaptogenesis, and neurotransmitter synthesis (Fretham et al.,
2011). Hippocampal-dependent memory appears and matures
between 3–18 months of age (Nelson, 1995). Because infants are
unable to fully regulate iron transport across the blood-brain
barrier the first 6 months after birth, it is paramount that infants
have adequate iron stores at birth.
Although hippocampal neurogenesis continues into
adulthood, it occurs at a much greater rate prenatally and
in the early postnatal period (Figure 1). The newborn neurons
integrate into the developing neural circuitry and are thought
to be important for learning and memory. Thus, in critical
developmental periods environmental insults that inhibit
neurogenesis or alter neuron maturation will likely affect present
and future behavior. Iron deficiency has been shown to inhibit

mothers were fed an iron-deficient diet and who were born with
iron deficiency, showed decreased brain-derived neurotrophic
factor (BDNF) levels, down-regulation of BDNF target genes,
and altered neuronal differentiation (Tran et al., 2008). Another
study was carried out to investigate the effects of perinatal iron
deficiency on hippocampal development in mice (Ranade et al.,
2013). Iron deficiency in the pre- or postnatal period reduced
BDNF and neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus of
pups. The impact of iron deficiency persisted, as the numbers
of hippocampal pyramidal and granule cells were reduced in
adults. Moreover, the structural and molecular defects in the pups
were correlated with performance in hippocampal-dependent
behavioral tasks, with pups from dams that were iron deficient
throughout pregnancy and lactation displaying a broad array
of defects, while pups from dams that were iron deficient only
during pregnancy or during lactation displaying subsets of
defects. These findings suggest that iron homeostasis is critical
for the expression of neurotrophic factors that support brain
development and provide a molecular basis for behavioral deficits
related to perinatal iron deficiency (Lozoff et al., 2006).
Iron deficiency can cause changes to neuronal morphology.
Neuronal shape is directly related to the computations performed
by the cell and is crucial to information processing. Two key
morphological features of neurons are dendritic arbor structure
and spine density and geometry (Spruston, 2008). The developing
arbor requires external inputs to stimulate and support branching
morphogenesis. The arbor relies on external cues BDNF that
signal via their respective transmembrane proteins. These in turn
modulate factors that facilitate elongation and branching by pro￾moting or reducing actin polymerization (Ackermann and Matus,
2003; Sekino et al., 2007). This process is not restricted to early
developmental periods because it is also necessary for reshaping
neural circuitry during experience-dependent learning through￾out life (i.e., synaptic plasticity; Figure 1; Bagot et al., 2009). Like
dendritic arbor structure, a spine’s morphology can impact its
function (Spruston, 2008). At post-natal day 15, CA1 pyramidal
neurons in rats that underwent a period of iron deficiency in
utero showed reduced dendritic branching and smaller spine
head diameters (Brunette et al., 2010). Smaller spine heads could
reduce conduction velocity resulting in less coordinated input to
the soma as well as represent smaller post-synaptic density which
could also affect signal transmission (Hodgkin, 1954).
Consistent with the structural changes noted above, iron defi￾ciency also impacts synaptic plasticity in the developing hip￾pocampus of rats (Jorgenson et al., 2005). For example, prena￾tal iron deficiency disrupted synaptic plasticity in the develop￾ing CA1 region of the hippocampus, but these differences were
also apparent in adulthood, after iron repletion. When iron was
replete, rat pups demonstrated no developmental increase in
synaptic strength, as seen in control animals. It is hypothesized
that major developmental events related to proper dendrite out￾growth and synaptogenesis were thwarted due to the unavailabil￾ity of adequate iron (Jorgenson et al., 2005). This certainly may
contribute to the lasting effects of iron deficiency on hippocam￾pal structure and function.
In addition to marked changes in dendrite out growth and
synaptogenesis, hypomyelination occurs when iron availability is
limited. Proper myelination is important for rapid impulse trans￾mission along axons. Myelination begins in the third trimester of
the fetal period and progresses rapidly through infancy (Figure 1;
Nakagawa et al., 1998). In the central nervous system, oligoden￾drocytes are responsible for myelination of axons. As mentioned
before, oligodendrocytes synthesize Tf to mobilize needed iron,
assuming it is readily available. Studies in humans and rats have
demonstrated that iron deficiency can severely affect myelination.
Increased latency of auditory brain stem potentials and visual
evoked potentials (indirect markers of myelination) has been
reported in iron deficient children (Roncagliolo et al., 1998;
Algarín et al., 2003). Oligodendrocytes synthesize fatty acids and

cholesterol for myelin (Mackler et al., 1979; McKay et al., 1983).
In a rat model, restriction of dietary iron during gestation and
the early post-natal period resulted in significantly less myelin
proteins, lipids, and cholesterol in the spinal cord, brain stem,
and cerebellar white matter (Yu et al., 1986; Ortiz et al., 2004).
Additionally, rats that were iron deficient in the perinatal period
displayed deficits in myelinogenesis at adulthood, even though
iron stores were replete (Ortiz et al., 2004). Finally, placing rats on
an iron-deficient diet post-weaning lead to a significant decrease
in myelination indices in the hindbrain and cerebrum (Beard and
Connor, 2003). This suggests that the need and usage of iron by
oligodendrocytes does not end during the perinatal period and
that the adult brain still requires adequate iron.
Iron is also essential for a number of enzymes involved in neu￾rotransmitter synthesis, including tryptophan hydroxylase used
to produce serotonin, and tyrosine hydroxylase used to synthe￾size norepinephrine and dopamine. Neurotransmitter synthesis
begins during embryogenesis (Figure 1; Herlenius and Lager￾crantz, 2001). Dopamine is important for regulating cognition
and emotion, reward and pleasure, movement, and hormone
release (Dunnett et al., 2005). Striatal networks, with dopamine
as the major neurotransmitter, relate to higher order cognitive
and emotional processes, motivated behavior, positive affect, and
reward-related processing, as well as motor function (Dunnett
et al., 2005). Studies in humans have shown that young adults,
who were iron deficient while an infant, tended to perform more
poorly on tasks that involved inhibitory control, set-shifting, and
planning, all of which are classified as executive functions that
utilize striatal networks that rely on dopamine (Lukowski et al.,
2010). Studies in rodents have determined that dopaminergic
neurons co-localize with iron throughout the brain, that extra￾cellular dopamine and norepinephrine are elevated in brains of
iron-deficient rats, and that the density of dopamine receptors
are altered in iron deficiency. These alterations are tightly con￾nected to the extent of iron loss in each brain region (Beard
and Connor, 2003). Other studies demonstrate that serotonin
transporter (SERT) and norepinephrine transporter densities are
also altered by iron deficiency (Burhans et al., 2005). Serotonin
is particularly important for proper wiring of neural circuits and
is highly implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders, such as
autism, anxiety, or depression (Calabrese et al., 2013). The SERT,
which is responsible for re-uptake of serotonin within the brain,
is the predominant mechanism controlling strength and duration
of serotonergic neurotransmission (Gaspar et al., 2003). SERT is
expressed more during development than in adulthood (Daws
and Gould, 2011). Iron deficiency leads to decreased expression
of SERT which in turn exacerbates the decreased expression of
BDNF. As previously noted, a reduction in BDNF can have serious
consequences for hippocampal structure and function leading to
deficits in learning and memory.
CONCLUSION
Iron deficiency is the leading micronutrient deficiency in the
world. It affects people of all ages, but is most detrimental to
infants and children. In developing countries, approximately 12%
of children under 5 will die from a micronutrient deficiency
(Ahmed et al., 2012). Children who survive will likely be iron
deficient, if not anemic. In industrialized countries like the United
States, the incidence of iron deficiency is increasing, probably
due in part to the increase in the number of children and adults
who are overweight or obese (inflammation disrupts iron home￾ostasis) (Del Giudice et al., 2009). As iron deficiency inhibits
learning as well as motor and emotional development, individ￾uals exposed to perinatal iron deficiency are at high risk for
failing to reach educational milestones later in life. Moreover,
as adults they are more likely to bear children who also expe￾rience iron deficiency. Hence, iron deficiency in one generation
can beget iron deficiency in the next generation, and so on.
Given the consequences of developmental delays in neurocog￾nitive function, such as decreased motor development, lower
IQ, difficulties with learning and memory (refer to Table 2 for
more evidence), strategies to prevent perinatal iron deficiencies
and to promote neural plasticity in individuals exposed to poor
iron status during key developmental periods, warrants more
attention.
