Introduction
ET-1, ET-2, and ET-3 are members of a peptide family that
has been the subject of much interest in the past decade.
Our laboratory and that of Highsmith identified this peptide
vasoconstrictor secreted from endothelial cells [1–3] that
was subsequently isolated, sequenced, cloned, and named
by Yanagisawa in 1988 [4]. The many diverse and overlap￾ping functions of these peptides have since implicated
endothelins in both homeostatic mechanisms as well as dis￾eases of the lungs. This review will focus on the role of
endothelins (particularly ET-1), emphasizing the need to
better understand endothelin biology and function in a wide
variety of disorders including diseases of the airways and
pulmonary vasculature, lung tumors, the acute respiratory
distress syndrome, and fibrotic diseases (Table 1).
Endothelin biochemistry
The endothelins are a family of 21 amino acid peptides, of
which there are three distinct isoforms (ET-1, ET-2, and ET￾3). The isoforms ET-2 and ET-3 differ from ET-1 by two and
six amino acids, respectively, and share significant homol￾ogy, especially at the carboxy terminus with sarafotoxins
a–e (Fig. 1). Endothelin-1 is the most abundant isoform and
has been best characterized. The lung has the highest
levels of ET-1 secreted by endothelium, smooth muscle,
airway epithelium, and a variety of other cells (Table 2).
ET-1 also circulates in the plasma. In the normal lung, ET-1
mainly localizes to vascular endothelium, airway and vascu￾lar smooth muscle cells and, to a lesser degree, the epithe￾lium. ET-2 has similar biologic functions as ET-1 and is
found in the myocardium, kidney and placental tissues.
ET-3 also circulates in plasma and is found in the central
nervous system, gastrointestinal tract, lung, and kidney
although the cellular source is not clear. The gene for ET-1
is located on chromosome 6, that for ET-2 on chromosome
1, and the gene for ET-3 on chromosome 20 [5].
All three endothelins are synthesized as preprohormones
and post-translationally processed to active peptides.
ET-1 processing has been best characterized and begins
with the 212 amino acid peptide (preproET-1), which is
then proteolytically cleaved by endopeptidases to big ET-1

Abstract
Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a 21 amino acid peptide with diverse biological activity that has been
implicated in numerous diseases. ET-1 is a potent mitogen regulator of smooth muscle tone, and
inflammatory mediator that may play a key role in diseases of the airways, pulmonary circulation, and
inflammatory lung diseases, both acute and chronic. This review will focus on the biology of ET-1 and
its role in lung disease.

(proET-1). The 39 amino acid proET-1 has 1% of the
biologic activity of ET-1, and is cleaved by the metallo￾endoprotease endothelin converting enzyme (ECE), result￾ing in the 21 amino acid protein with potent biologic
functions [6,7] (Fig. 1). ECE is found in many cell types in
the lung including endothelium, epithelium and alveolar
macrophages [8]. ET-1 is not stored in the cell [9,10], but
is processed and transported through the cell in vesicles,
resulting in directional secretion (80%) of ET-1 toward the
interstitium and smooth muscle and away from the luminal
surface of the airway or vessel [11–13]. Directional secre￾tion allows ET-1 to act in a paracrine or autocrine manner
whereas secretion into the circulation allows ET-1 to act
as a hormone.
There are currently two distinct human endothelin recep￾tors known, endothelin A (ETA) and endothelin B (ETB)
receptors, which are members of the seven transmem￾brane, G protein-coupled rhodopsin superfamily [14,15].
The ETA and ETB receptor genes are located on chromo￾somes 4 and 13, respectively. ETA has a higher affinity for
ET-1 and ET-2 than ET-3, but all three have equal affinity
for ETB receptors. A third receptor subtype (endothelin C)
with high affinity for ET-3 has been isolated and cloned

from Xenopus laevis [16]. ETA receptors in normal lung
are found in greatest abundance on vascular and airway
smooth muscle, whereas ETB receptors are most often
found on the endothelium. Clearance of ET-1 from the cir￾culation is mediated by the ETB receptor primarily in the
lung, but also in the kidney and liver [17].
Activation of both ETA and ETB receptors on smooth
muscle cells leads to vasoconstriction whereas ETB
receptor activation leads to bronchoconstriction. Activa￾tion of ETB receptors located on endothelial cells leads to
vasodilation by increasing nitric oxide (NO) production.
The mitogenic and inflammatory modulator functions of
ET-1 are primarily mediated by ETA receptor activity.
Binding of the ligand to its receptor results in coupling of
cell-specific G proteins that activate or inhibit adenylate
cyclase, stimulate phosphatidyl-inositol-specific phosholi￾pase, open voltage gated calcium and potassium chan￾nels, and so on. The varied effects of ET-1 receptor
activation thus depend on the G protein and signal trans￾duction pathways active in the cell of interest [18]. A
growing number of receptor antagonists exist with variable
selectivity for one or both receptor subtypes.
Regulation of ET-1 is at the level of transcription, with
stimuli including shear stress, hypoxia, cytokines (IL-2,
IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor α, IFN-β, etc), lipopolysaccha￾rides, and many growth factors (transforming growth
factor-β, platelet-derived growth factor, epidermal growth
factor, etc) inducing transcription of ET-1 mRNA and
secretion of protein [18]. ET-1 acting in an autocrine
fashion may also increase ET-1 expression [19]. ET-1
expression is decreased by NO [20]. Some stimuli may
additionally enhance preproET-1 mRNA stability, leading
to increased and sustained ET-1 expression. The number
of ETA and ETB receptors is also cell specific and regu￾lated by a variety of growth factors [18]. Because ET-1
and receptor expression is influenced by many diverse
physical and biochemical mechanisms, the role of ET-1 in
pathologic states has been difficult to define, and these
are addressed in subsequent parts of this article.
Airway diseases
In the airway, ET-1 is localized primarily to the bronchial
smooth muscle with low expression in the epithelium. Cel￾lular subsets of the epithelium that secrete ET-1 include
mucous cells, serous cells, and Clara cells [21]. ET
binding sites are found on bronchial smooth muscle, alve￾olar septae, endothelial cells, and parasympathetic ganglia
[22,23]. ET-1 expression in the airways, as previously
noted, is regulated by inflammatory mediators.
Eosinophilic airway inflammation, as may be seen in
severe asthma, is associated with increased ET-1 levels in
the lung [24]. ET-1 secretion may also act in an autocrine
or paracrine fashion, via the ETA receptor, leading to
increased transepithelial potential difference and ciliary
beat frequency, and to exerting mitogenic effects on
airway epithelium and smooth muscle cells [25–28].
All three endothelins cause bronchoconstriction in intact
airways, with ET-1 being the most potent. Denuded
bronchi constrict equally to all three endothelins, suggest￾ing considerable modulation of ET-1 effects by the epithe￾lium [29]. The vast majority of ET-1 binding sites on
bronchial smooth muscle are ETB receptors, and
bronchoconstriction in human bronchi is not inhibited by
ETA antagonists but augmented by ETB receptor agonists
[30–32]. Since cultured airway epithelium secretes equal
amounts of ET-1 and ET-3, which have equivalent affinity
for the ETB receptor, bronchoconstriction could be medi￾ated by both endothelins [33].
While ET-1 stimulates release of multiple cytokines impor￾tant in airway inflammation, it does not enhance secretion of
histamine or leukotrienes. ET-1 does increase prostaglandin
release [32]. Inhibition of cyclo-oxygenase, however, has no
effect on bronchoconstriction suggesting that, despite the
release of multiple mediators, ET-1 mediated bronchocon￾striction is a direct effect of activation of the ETB receptor
[32]. ETA mediated bronchoconstriction may also be impor￾tant following ETB receptor desensitization or denudation of
the airway epithelium, as may occur during airway inflamma￾tion and during the late, sustained airway response to
inhaled antigens [31,34,35]. Interestingly, heterozygous ET￾1 knockout mice, with a 50% reduction in ET-1 peptide,
have airway hyperresponsiveness but not remodeling, sug￾gesting the decrease in ET-1 modulates bronchoconstric￾tion activity by a functional mechanism, possibly by
decreasing basal NO production [36,37].
Asthma is also an inflammatory airway disease character￾ized by bronchoconstriction and hyperreactivity with influx
of inflammatory cells, mucus production, edema, and
airway thickening. ET-1 may have important roles in each
of these processes. While ET-1 causes immediate bron￾choconstriction [38], it also increases bronchial reactivity
to inhaled antigens [35] as well as influx of inflammatory
cells [39,40], increased cytokine production [40], airway
edema [41], and airway remodeling [28,42,43]. Airway
inflammation also leads to increased ET-1 synthesis, pos￾sibly perpetuating the inflammation and bronchoconstric￾tion [44]. ET-1 release from cultured peripheral
mononuclear and bronchial epithelial cells from asthmatics
is also increased [45,46]. Inhibition of ETA or combined
ETA and ETB receptors additionally leads to decreased
airway inflammation in antigen-challenged animals, sug￾gesting that the proinflammatory effects of ET-1 in the
airway are mediated by ETA receptors [39,47].
Children with asthma have increased circulating levels of
ET-1 [48]. Adult asthmatics have normal levels between
attacks but, during acute attacks, have elevated serum

commentary review reports primary research
ET-1 levels that correlate inversely with airflow measure￾ments and decrease with treatment [49]. Bronchoalveolar
lavage (BAL) ET-1 in asthmatics is similarly increased to
concentrations that cause bronchoconstriction and
inversely correlates with forced expiratory volume in 1 s
(FEV1) [29,50,51]. As in cultured epithelial cells, ET-1 and
ET-3 are found in equal amounts in BAL fluid from asthmat￾ics [33,52]. There is also a relative increase in ETB versus
ETA receptor expression in asthmatic patients, which may
contribute to increased bronchoconstriction [53]. Not all
asthmatics, however, have increased ET-1 as patients with
nocturnal asthma have decreased BAL ET-1 levels [54].
Treatment of acute asthma exacerbations with steroids,
beta-adrenergic agonists or phosphodiesterase inhibitors
resulted in decreased BAL ET-1 [52,55]. Immunostaining
and in situ hybridization for ET-1 in biopsy specimens from
asthmatics have shown an increase in ET-1 in the bronchial
epithelium that correlates with asthma symptoms [46,56].
Cigarette smoking leads to increased circulating ET-1
[57] but patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, in the absence of pulmonary hypertension and
hypoxemia, do not have increased plasma ET-1 [58–60].
Increases in urinary ET-1 instead correlate with decreases
in oxygenation, possibly through hypoxic release of ET-1
from the kidney [61,62]. Smokers also have impaired ET-1
mediated vasodilation that correlates with bronchial hyper￾responsiveness and may contribute to pulmonary hyper￾tension [63,64].
ET-1 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of
bronchiectasis by its ability to promote neutrophil chemo￾taxis, adherence, and activation [65–69]. Sputum ET-1
levels are increased in patients with cystic fibrosis [59],
and sputum ET-1 correlated with Pseduomonas infection
in noncystic fibrosis related bronchiectasis [70].
ET-1 has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of
bronchiolitis obliterans (BO), which is characterized by
injury to small conducting airways resulting in formation of
proliferative, collagen rich tissue obliterating airway archi￾tecture. BO is the leading cause of late mortality from lung
transplantation, and ET-1 is increased in lung allografts
[71]. The pro-inflammatory and mitogenic properties of
ET-1 in the airways has led to speculation that ET-1 may
be involved in formation of the lesion [28]. This is further
supported by the increase in BAL ET-1 in lung allografts
[72,73]. The in vivo gene transfer of ET-1 to the airway
epithelium using the hemagglutinating virus of Japan in
rats recently resulted in pathologic changes in the distal
airways identical to those seen in human BO specimens
[74]. These changes were not due to nonspecific effects
of the hemagglutinating virus of Japan itself, but could be
attributed to the presence of the ET-1 gene, which was
localized to the airway epithelium, hyperplastic lesions,
and alveolar cells.
Pulmonary vascular disease
Pulmonary hypertension is a rare and progressive disease
characterized by increases in normally low pulmonary vas￾cular tone, pulmonary vascular remodeling, and progres￾sive right heart failure. ET-1 has been implicated as a
mediator in the changes seen in pulmonary hypertension.
In the pulmonary vasculature, ET-1 is found primarily in
endothelial cells and to a lesser extent in the vascular
smooth muscle cells. The endothelium secretes ET-1 pri￾marily to the basolateral surface of the cell. ET-1 secretion
may be increased by a variety of stimuli including
cytokines, catecholamines, and physical forces such as
shear stress, and decreased by NO, prostaglandins, and
oxidant stress [20,75–78]. Hypoxia has been reported to
increase, have no effect, or decrease ET-1 release from
endothelial cells [79–83].
Activation of the receptors for ET-1 in the pulmonary vas￾culature leads to both vasodilation and vasoconstriction,
and depends on both cell type and receptor. In the whole
lung, ETA receptors are the most abundant and are local￾ized to the medial layer of the arteries, decreasing in inten￾sity in the peripheral circulation [84,85]. ETB receptors
are also found in the media of the pulmonary vessels,
increasing in intensity in the distal circulation, while intimal
ETB receptors are localized in the larger elastic arteries
[85]. This distribution of receptors has important implica￾tions in understanding ET-1 regulation of vascular tone.
Vascular ET-1 receptors may be increased by several
factors including angiotensin and hypoxia [80,85–87].
ET-1 can act as both a vasodilator and vasoconstrictor in
the pulmonary circulation. Generation of NO or opening of
ATP-sensitive potassium channels leading to hyperpolar￾ization results in vasodilation mediated by ETB receptors
on pulmonary endothelium [88,89]. In hypertensive, chron￾ically hypoxic lungs with increased ETB receptor expres￾sion, augmented vasodilation is due to increased ETB
mediated NO release that is inhibited by hypoxic ventila￾tion, while inhibition of NO synthesis leads to increased
ET-1 mediated vasoconstriction [85,90–92]. Both ETA
and ETB receptors, conversely, acting on vascular smooth
muscle, mediate ET-1 induced vasoconstriction. In the
normal lung, ET-1 causes vasoconstriction primarily by
activation of the ETA receptors in the large, conducting
vessels of the lung [93,94]. In the smaller, resistance
vessels of the lung, ETB receptors in the media predomi￾nate and are responsible for the ET-1 induced vasocon￾striction [93]. Interestingly, preconstriction of the
pulmonary circulation resulted in a shift from primarily ETA
mediated to ETB mediated vasoconstriction [94].
The overall effect of ET-1 on vascular tone depends on
both the dose and on the pre-existing tone in the lung. ET-1
administration during acute hypoxic vasoconstriction will
result in transient pulmonary vasodilation [89]. This effect is

dose dependent, with lower doses leading to vasodilation
while higher or repetitive doses cause vasoconstriction fol￾lowing an initial, brief vasodilation [89]. The role of ET-1 in
the acute hypoxic vasoconstriction in the lung is not
certain. ETA receptor antagonism attenuates hypoxic pul￾monary vasoconstriction in several species [95], and ET-1
may be implicated in the mechanism of acute hypoxic
response by inhibition of K-ATP channels [96].
Several lines of evidence have suggested the importance
of ET-1 in chronic hypoxic pulmonary hypertension. ET-1 is
increased in plasma and lungs of rats following exposure
to hypoxia [80,97]. Treatment with either ETA or com￾bined ETA and ETB receptor antagonists additionally
attenuates the development of hypoxic pulmonary hyper￾tension [98,99]. ET-1 has also been implicated in the vas￾cular remodeling associated with chronic hypoxia through
its mitogenic effects on vascular smooth muscle cells
[98,100].
ET-1 has also been implicated in other animal models of
pulmonary hypertension. ET-1 is increased in fawn hooded
rats that develop severe pulmonary hypertension when
raised under conditions of mild hypoxia and in monocro￾taline treated rats [101,102]. The increase in ET-1 in both
of these forms of pulmonary hypertension may be
contributing to increases in vascular tone as well as in vas￾cular remodeling [103–106,114]. Interestingly, transgenic
mice overexpressing the human preproET-1 gene, with
modestly increased lung ET-1 levels (35–50%), do not
develop pulmonary hypertension under normoxic condi￾tions or an exaggerated response to chronic hypoxia [107].
Human pulmonary hypertension is classified as primary, or
unexplained, or secondary to other cardiopulmonary dis￾eases or connective tissue diseases (ie scleroderma).
Hallmarks of the disease include progressive increases in
pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary vascular
remodeling, with thickening of the medial layer small pul￾monary arterioles and formation of the complex plexiform
lesion [108]. Circulating ET-1 is increased in humans with
pulmonary hypertension, either primary or due to other car￾diopulmonary disease [109]. Levels are highest in patients
with primary pulmonary hypertension. Since the lung is the
major source for clearance of ET-1 from the circulation,
increased arterio-venous ratios as seen in primary pul￾monary hypertension suggest either decreased clearance
or increased production in the lung [17,109]. ET-1 is also
increased in lungs of patients with pulmonary hyperten￾sion, with the greatest increase seen in the small resis￾tance arteries and the plexiform lesions [110], and may
correlate with pulmonary vascular resistance [111]. Inter￾estingly, treatment with continuous infusion of prostacyclin
resulted in clinical improvement and a decrease in the
arterio-venous ratio of ET-1 [112], possibly by decreasing
ET-1 synthesis from endothelial cells [76]. Studies using
ET-1 receptor antagonists in the treatment of primary pul￾monary hypertension are underway and may offer hope to
patients with this disease by inhibiting this pluripotent
peptide’s effects on vascular tone and remodeling.
Lung transplantation and rejection
Several lines of evidence suggest the importance of ET-1
in lung allograft survival and rejection. The peptide has
been implicated as an important factor in ischemia-reper￾fusion injury at the time of transplant as well as in acute
and chronic rejection of the allograft.
Circulating ET-1 is increased in humans undergoing lung
transplant immediately following perfusion of the allograft.
Plasma ET-1 increased threefold within minutes, remained
high for 12 hours following transplantation, and declined
to near normal levels within 24 hours [113]. This increase
in ET-1 correlated with the increase in pulmonary vascular
resistance occurring about 6 hours post-transplantation,
suggesting that the release of ET-1 in the circulation may
have mediated this event. ET-1 in BAL fluid from recipients
of lung allografts is similarly increased several fold and
remains elevated up to 2 years post-transplant [72,73]. In
recipients of single lung transplants, ET-1 was increased
10-fold in BAL fluid from the transplanted lung compared
with the native lung, suggesting that the increase in ET-1
was due to the graft and not the underlying disease requir￾ing transplant [72]. ET-1 in BAL fluid did not, however,
correlate with episodes of infection or rejection.
The cellular source of ET-1 in lung allografts is unknown.
The expression of ET-1 in nontransplanted human lungs is
low and found primarily in the vascular endothelium [114].
Transbronchial biopsy specimens obtained either for sur￾veillance or for clinical suspicion of infection or rejection
following transplantation revealed the presence of ET-1 in
the airway epithelium and in alveolar macrophages [115].
ET-1 was occasionally seen in lymphocytes but not in the
endothelium or pneumocytes. ET-1 localization was no dif￾ferent in surveillance specimens compared with infected
or rejecting lungs, or changed over time from transplanta￾tion. This study suggests that the source of the increased
BAL ET-1 in transplanted lungs is due to the increased
number of alveolar inflammatory cells and de novo expres￾sion in the airway epithelium. The biologic importance of
the ET-1 from inflammatory cells is supported by the
observation that peripheral mononuclear cells from dogs
with mild to moderate lung allograft rejection cause vaso￾constriction in pulmonary arterial rings, which is attenu￾ated by the ETA blocker BQ123 [116].
Analysis of ET-1 binding activity in failed transplanted
human lungs suggested that ET-1 binding activity was not
different compared with normal lung in the lung
parenchyma, bronchial smooth muscle, or perivascular
infiltrates. ET-1 binding was, however, decreased in small
Respiratory Research Vol 2 No 2 Fagan et al

muscular arteries (pulmonary arteries and bronchial arter￾ies) in the failed transplants, suggesting a role for ET-1 in
impaired vasoregulation of transplanted lungs [117].
Ischemia-reperfusion injury is the leading cause of early
post-operative graft failure and death. In its severest mani￾festation, increased pulmonary vascular resistance,
hypoxia, and pulmonary edema lead to cor pulmonale and
death [118]. ET-1 has been implicated as a mediator of
these events. The increase in pulmonary vascular resis￾tance observed in human recipients of lung allografts
follows an increase in circulating ET-1 and falls with
decreases in circulating ET-1 [113]. A similar pattern is
seen in dogs subjected to allotransplantation [119]. Con￾scious dogs with left pulmonary allografts demonstrate an
increase in both resting pulmonary perfusion pressure and
acute pulmonary vasoconstrictor response to hypoxia
[120]. Administration of ETA selective or combined ETA
and ETB receptor blockers did not change the resting
tone. ETB receptor mediated hypoxic pulmonary vasocon￾striction appeared, however, to be increased in allograft
recipients. In another study, administration of a mixed ETA
and ETB receptor antagonist (SB209670) to dogs before
reperfusion of the allograft resulted in a marked increase in
oxygenation, decreases in pulmonary arterial pressures
and improved survival compared with control animals
[121]. In a model of ischemia reperfusion, inhibitors of
ECE additionally attenuated the increase in circulating ET￾1 and the severity of lung injury [122]. ET-1 receptor
antagonists did not, however, completely eliminate the
ischemia-reperfusion injury, suggesting that changes in
other vasoactive mediators, such as an increase in throm￾boxane, a decrease in prostaglandins, or a decrease in
NO, may also contribute to the increased pulmonary vas￾cular resistance. Administration of NO donor (FK409) to
both donor and recipient dogs before lung transplantation
reduced pulmonary arterial pressure, lung edema, and
inflammation, and improved survival. This suggests that
reductions in NO following transplantation may be partly
responsible for early graft failure [123]. Treatment with NO
donor was also associated with a decrease in plasma
ET-1 levels.
Acute rejection is manifested by diffuse infiltrates, hypoxia,
and airflow limitation, and may lead to respiratory insuffi￾ciency and death. BAL ET-1 was increased in dogs during
episodes of acute rejection that decreased with immuno￾suppressive treatment [124]. Acute episodes of rejection
in humans, however, are not associated with further
increases in BAL ET-1 [72]. Chronic rejection of allografts,
manifested as BO, is the major cause of morbidity and
mortality in long-term lung transplant survivors [71]. The
etiology of BO following transplant is unclear but may be
related to repeated episodes of acute rejection, chronic
low-grade rejection, or organizing pneumonia [125]. As
discussed earlier, a chronic increase in ET-1, as seen in
lung allografts, may contribute to bronchospasm and pro￾liferative bronchiolitis obliterans due to the bronchocon￾strictor and smooth muscle mitogenic effects of ET-1
[28,126]. This is further supported by the increase of BAL
ET-1 in the transplanted lung, which is susceptible to BO,
but not the native lung in recipients of single lung trans￾plants [72].
Pulmonary malignancies
The mitogenic effects of ET-1 may play a role in the devel￾opment of pulmonary malignancy as well as metastasis to
the lung. Many human tumor cell lines, including prostate,
breast, gastric, ovary, colon, etc, produce ET-1. The impor￾tance of the ET-1 may lie in its mitogenic effects on tumor
growth and survival. This has been suggested by blockade
of ETA receptors resulting in a decrease in mitogenic
effects of ET-1 in a prostate cancer and colorectal cell
lines [127,128]. ET-1 receptors in tumor cells may also be
altered with increases in the ETA receptor and downregu￾lation of ETB receptors [129]. Other tumors may have an
increase in ETB receptors, however, and blockade of ETB
results in a decrease in tumor growth [130,131]. Tumor
cells may, as a result of this altered balance, lose the
ability to respond to regulatory signals from their environ￾ment. ET-1 may additionally protect against Fas-ligand
mediated apoptosis [132].
ET-1 has been detected using immunohistochemistry and
in situ hybridization in pulmonary adenocarcinomas and
squamous cell tumors and, to a lesser extent, small cell
and carcinoid tumors [133]. In situ hybridization also
demonstrated a similar pattern of ET-1 mRNA expression
in non-neuroendocrine tumors. ET-1 receptors have also
been found in a variety of pulmonary tumor cell lines. ETA
receptors were found in small cell tumors, adenocarcino￾mas and large cell tumors, while ETB receptors were
expressed primarily in adenocarcinomas and small cell
tumors [134]. ECE, which converts big ET-1 to ET-1, the
committed step in ET-1 biosynthesis, was also found in
human lung tumors but not in adjacent normal lung [135].
These findings, combined with the presence of ET-1 in
lung tumors, suggest a possible autocrine loop that sus￾tains and supports the growth of lung tumors. A recent
study, however, suggested that, while ETA and ECE-1
were detectable in lung tumors, these genes were down￾regulated compared with normal bronchial epithelial cell
lines [136]. It was proposed that the role of ET-1 in lung
tumors is not that of an autocrine factor, but that of a
paracrine growth factor to the stroma and vasculature sur￾rounding the tumor allowing angiogenesis.
Tumor angiogenesis is necessary for continued growth of
the tumor beyond the limits of oxygen diffusion. The
growth of vessels into the tumor is also important to
metastatic potential of the tumor. ET-1 may play an impor￾tant role in angiogenesis and tumor growth and survival

through induction of vascular endothelial growth factor
expression and sprouting of new vessels into the tumor
and surrounding tissue [137,138]. ET-1 binding activity
was found in blood vessels and vascular stroma surround￾ing lung tumors at the time of resection, most markedly
surrounding squamous cell tumors [139]. ET-1 production
may be further augmented by the hypoxic environment
found within large solid tumors [140]. Since metastasis is
dependent on neo-vascularization, ET-1 may also be an
important mediator of this phenomenon. ET-1 receptor
antagonists may have a useful role in the treatment of neo￾plastic disease by inhibiting growth as well as metastatic
potential of human tumors.
Acute respiratory distress syndrome
Experimental lung injury of many different types results in
increased circulating ET-1, BAL ET-1, and lung tissue
ET-1 [18]. ET-1 levels in humans are also increased in
sepsis, burns, disseminated intravascular coagulation,
acute lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome
(ARDS) [141–147]. ET-1 increases also correlate with a
poorer outcome with multiple organ failure, increased pul￾monary arterial pressure, increased airway pressure and
decreased PiO2/FiO2, while clinical improvement corre￾lates with decreased ET-1 levels [144,145,147]. The
arterio-venous ratio for ET-1 is increased in patients with
ARDS but it is not clear whether this is due to increased
secretion of ET-1 in the lungs or decreased clearance
[142,144]. In patients who succumbed to ARDS, there
was also a marked increase in tissue ET-1 immunostaining
in vascular endothelium, alveolar macrophages, smooth
muscle, and airway epithelium compared with lungs of
patients who died without ARDS. Interestingly, these
same patients also had a decrease in immunostaining for
both endothelial nitric oxide synthase and inducible nitric
oxide synthase in the lung [148].
ARDS is also characterized by the presence of inflamma￾tory cells in the lung. Since ET-1 may act as an immune
modulator, an increase in ET-1 may contribute to lung
injury by inducing expression of cytokines including tumor
necrosis factor and IL-6 and IL-8 [149]. These cytokines
may in turn stimulate the production of many inflammatory
mediators, leading to lung injury. ET-1 additionally acti￾vated neutrophils, and increased neutrophil migration and
trapping in the lung [65–69].
Another hallmark of ARDS is disruption and dysfunction of
the pulmonary vascular endothelium leading to accumula￾tion of lung water. The role of endothelin in formation of
pulmonary edema is uncertain. Infusion of ET-1 raises pul￾monary vascular pressure, but it is uncertain whether ET-1
by itself increased pulmonary protein or fluid transport in
the lung [150–152]. ET-1 may rather be acting synergisti￾cally with other mediators to lead to pulmonary edema
[153,154].
Pulmonary fibrosis
Pulmonary fibrosis is the final outcome for a variety of inju￾rious processes involving the lung parenchyma. The final
common pathway in response to injury to the alveolar wall
involves recruitment of inflammatory cells, release of
inflammatory mediators, and resolution. The reparative
phase occasionally becomes disordered, resulting in pro￾gressive fibrosis.
ET-1 in the lung may be important in the initial events in
lung injury by activating neutrophils to aggregate and
release elastase and oxygen radicals, increasing neu￾trophil adherence, activating mast cells, and inducing
cytokine production from monocytes [65–69,149,155].
Among the many cytokines induced by ET-1 that are
important in mediating pulmonary fibrosis are transform￾ing growth factor-β and tumor necrosis factor α
[156,157]. ET-1 is also profibrotic by stimulating fibrob￾last replication, migration, contraction, and collagen syn￾thesis and secretion while decreasing collagen
degradation [158–162]. ET-1 additionally enhances the
conversion of fibroblasts into contractile myelofibroblasts
[43,163]. ET-1 also increases fibronectin production by
bronchial epithelial cells [164]. Finally, ET-1 has mito￾genic effects on vascular and airway smooth muscle
[126,28]. ET-1 may thus play an important role in the
initial injury and eventual fibrotic reparative process of
many inflammatory events in the lung.
Several lines of evidence regarding the importance of
ET-1 in pulmonary fibrosis are available. Plasma and BAL
ET-1 levels are increased in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
[50,165]. Lung biopsies from patients with idiopathic
pulmonary fibrosis have additionally increased ET-1
immunostaining in airway epithelial cells and type II
pneumocytes, which correlates with disease activity
[166]. Scleroderma is commonly associated with pul￾monary hypertension and pulmonary fibrosis. Plasma and
BAL ET-1 is increased in these patients [160,167,168],
but it is unclear whether the presence of either pul￾monary hypertension or pulmonary fibrosis increases
these levels further [167]. BAL fluid from patients with
scleroderma increased proliferation of cultured lung
fibroblasts, which was inhibited by ETA receptor antago￾nist. This suggests that the ET-1 in the airspace may be
contributing significantly to the fibrotic response [160].
An increase in ET-1 binding has also been reported in
lung tissue from patients with scleroderma associated
pulmonary fibrosis [169]. Pulmonary inflammatory cells
also appear to be primed for ET-1 production because
cultured alveolar macrophages from patients with sclero￾derma and lung involvement secrete increased amounts
of ET-1 in response to stimulation with lipopolysaccha￾ride [170]. These observations collectively suggest that
augmented ET-1 release may contribute to and perpetu￾ate the inflammatory process.

commentary review reports primary research
Bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in animals is asso￾ciated with increased ET-1 expression in alveolar
macrophages and epithelium [171]. The increase in ET-1
proceeds the development of pulmonary fibrosis. The use
of ET-1 receptor antagonists has produced mixed results
in limiting the development of bleomycin-induced fibrosis.
A decrease in fibroblast replication and secretion of extra￾cellular matrix proteins in vitro but not a decrease in lung
collagen content in vivo has been shown using ETA or
combined ETA and ETB receptor antagonists after
bleomycin [172]. Another group did, however, observe a
decrease in fibrotic area in lungs of rats following
bleomycin that were treated with a mixed ETA and ETB
receptor antagonist [173].
While ET-1 seems to correlate with pulmonary fibrosis, it
remains uncertain whether the increase in ET-1 is a cause
or consequence of the lung disease. Pulmonary fibrosis was
recently reported in mice that constitutively overexpress
human ET-1 [107]. These mice were known to develop pro￾gressive nephrosclerosis in the absence of systemic hyper￾tension [174]. The transgene was localized throughout the
lung, with the strongest expression in the bronchial wall. In
the lung, the mice developed age-dependent accumulation
of collagen and accumulation of CD4+ lymphocytes in the
perivascular space. This observation suggests that an
increase in lung ET-1 alone may play a causative role in the
development of pulmonary fibrosis [107,175].
Conclusion
Since its discovery 12 years ago, much evidence has
accumulated regarding the biologic activity and potential
role of ET-1 in a variety of diseases of the respiratory track.
As compelling as much of this evidence is, the causal rela￾tionship between ET-1 activity and disease is not com￾plete. The increasing use of ECE and endothelin receptor
antagonists in experimental and human respiratory disor￾ders will help to clarify the role of this pluripotent peptide
in health and disease.
