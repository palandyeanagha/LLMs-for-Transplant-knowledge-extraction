Echocardiography plays a key role in the diagnosis of infective endocar￾ditis (IE) but can be inconclusive in patients in whom prosthetic valve
endocarditis (PVE) is suspected. The incremental diagnostic value
of 18F-FDG PET and radiolabeled leukocyte scintigraphy in IE pa￾tients has already been reported. The aim of this study was to com￾pare the respective performance of 18F-FDG PET and leukocyte
scintigraphy for the diagnosis of PVE in 39 patients. Methods: 18F-FDG PET and leukocyte scintigraphy were performed on 39 con￾secutive patients admitted because of clinically suspected PVE and
inconclusive echocardiography results. The results of 18F-FDG PET
and leukocyte scintigraphy were analyzed separately and retro￾spectively by experienced physicians masked to the results of the
other imaging technique and to patient outcome. The final Duke–Li
IE classification was made after a 3-mo follow-up. Results: Of the 39
patients, 14 were classified as having definite IE, 4 as having possible
IE, and 21 as not having IE. The average interval between 18F-FDG
PET and leukocyte scintigraphy was 7 ± 7 d. Sensitivity, specificity,
positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy
were 93%, 71%, 68%, 94%, and 80%, respectively, for 18F-FDG
PET and 64%, 100%, 100%, 81%, and 86%, respectively, for leu￾kocyte scintigraphy. Discrepancies between the results of 18F-FDG
PET and leukocyte scintigraphy occurred in 12 patients (31%). In
patients with definite IE, 5 had true-positive 18F-FDG PET results but
false-negative leukocyte scintigraphy results. Of these 5 patients, 3
had nonpyogenic microorganism IE (Coxiella or Candida). Of patients
for whom endocarditis had been excluded, 6 had true-negative
leukocyte scintigraphy results but false-positive 18F-FDG PET results.
These 6 patients had been imaged in the first 2 mo after the last
cardiac surgery. The last patient with a discrepancy between 18F￾FDG PET and leukocyte scintigraphy was classified as having pos￾sible endocarditis and had positive 18F-FDG PET results and nega￾tive leukocyte scintigraphy results. Conclusion: 18F-FDG PET offers
high sensitivity for the detection of active infection in patients with
suspected PVE and inconclusive echocardiography results. Leukocyte
scintigraphy offers a higher specificity, however, than 18F-FDG PET
for diagnosis of IE and should be considered in cases of inconclu￾sive 18F-FDG PET findings or in the first 2 mo after cardiac surgery.

Infective endocarditis (IE) is a serious complication of valve replace￾ment and has been reported in 1%–6% of patients with a valve pros￾thesis (1). Despite improvement in medical treatment and surgery, pros￾thetic valve endocarditis (PVE) remains associated with a high mortality
rate (2,3). Early identification of PVE is of paramount importance,
because these patients have a high mortality rate in the absence of
antibiotherapy (4). When abscess or extensive perivalvular infection is
present, cardiac surgery is usually recommended (5). Echocardiography
plays a key role in the diagnosis of PVE, but the presence of endocar￾ditis can be difficult to confirm in patients with cardiac prosthetic
material, in particular during the early stages of the infectious process.
Recently, 2 different imaging techniques have demonstrated
their incremental value over echocardiography for the diagnosis of
endocarditis: 18F-FDG-PET (6,7) and radiolabeled leukocyte scin￾tigraphy (8,9). Each of these techniques presents specific advan￾tages and drawbacks for the detection of infection in patients with
suspected PVE. On the one hand, 18F-FDG PET has the advantage
of relatively short acquisition times and high sensitivity for the
detection of cells with high metabolic activity. 18F-FDG PET does
not, however, allow for discrimination between infective and in￾flammatory processes. In addition, analysis of 18F-FDG uptake in
cardiac valves can be hampered by physiologic uptake in the neigh￾boring myocardium. On the other hand, leukocyte scintigraphy
offers high specificity for the presence of acute infection when
radiolabeled leukocytes accumulate in tissues. However, in vitro
radiolabeling of leukocytes requires special equipment, is time￾consuming, and involves direct handling of blood products. In
addition, imaging with leukocyte scintigraphy is performed over
24 h and has a lower signal than 18F-FDG PET. The precise role of
each of these 2 imaging techniques in the diagnosis of PVE still
needs to be defined. The aim of this study was to compare the re￾spective performance of 18F-FDG PET and leukocyte scintigraphy
for the diagnosis of PVE in a cohort of 39 consecutive patients
who underwent both imaging modalities for clinical indications.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Characteristics
Between May 2010 and July 2013, 39 consecutive patients with a
valve prosthesis, patch, or aortic tube implanted by open-chest cardiac
surgery admitted to Bichat University Hospital because of suspected
PVE underwent both 18F-FDG PET imaging and leukocyte scintigraphy.
During this time, 382 patients, including 67 with a cardiac prosthesis,
underwent 18F-FDG PET imaging in our institution because of suspected
endocarditis, and 50 patients underwent leukocyte scintigraphy because
of suspected PVE. Patients were excluded from this study if they had
only an implanted stimulation device, a vascular prosthesis, or a left
ventricular assist device or if they had complicated PVE requiring
immediate surgery. In addition, patients for whom more than 1 mo
had passed between 18F-FDG PET and leukocyte scintigraphy imaging
were excluded from the study. Clinical characteristics, Duke–Li criteria
for the diagnosis of endocarditis (10), and the results of leukocyte scin￾tigraphy and 18F-FDG PET were collected for each patient. All patients
underwent initial transesophageal echocardiography with a multiplanar
probe by an expert echocardiographer. Abnormal findings on cardiac
echocardiography were classified as previously described (8). The Insti￾tutional Review Board of Bichat University Hospital approved this study,
and all subjects gave written informed consent for review of their records.
18F-FDG PET/CT
Imaging Protocol. Patients received a low-carbohydrate, high-fat
meal the evening before 18F-FDG PET imaging and were then asked
to fast for least 12 h to limit physiologic myocardial 18F-FDG uptake.
Imaging was performed only if the fasting glucose level was lower than
7.7 mmol/L before 18F-FDG injection. 18F-FDG was injected intrave￾nously at a dose of 4 MBq/kg (average total injected dose, 300 MBq).
PET and CT were performed with a PET/CT hybrid system (Discovery
690; GE Healthcare). Imaging started 60 min after 18F-FDG injection
with a nonenhanced, low-dose CT scan (120 kV, 80 mA), which was
followed by a whole-body PET acquisition in 3-dimensional mode
with an acquisition time of 4 min per bed position. Transverse PET
slices were reconstructed into a 256 · 256 matrix with an iterative
3-dimensional reconstruction algorithm of the system software. Low￾dose CT was used for attenuation correction of PET images and for
localization of prosthetic and tissue structures. The radiation dose for
this acquisition protocol was estimated to be 10 mSv.
Interpretation Criteria. 18F-FDG PET acquisitions were interpreted
using the Advantage Workstation of the PET/CT system (GE Healthcare)
by an experienced nuclear medicine physician masked to the results of
leukocyte scintigraphy and to patient outcome. Image analysis was
based on visual interpretation and semiquantitative measurement of
18F-FDG uptake using the following previously described criteria (6).
On visual analysis, hypermetabolic activity in the prosthetic or
periprosthetic areas was considered abnormal. Increased 18F-FDG up￾take in these areas had to be confirmed on non–attenuation-corrected
PET images. Visual analysis defined whether PET/CT results were
classified as positive or negative. Septic emboli were defined as
extracardiac abnormal 18F-FDG uptake in tissue. In addition, the pat￾tern of 18F-FDG uptake in the myocardium was divided into 3 groups:
diffuse uptake, focal uptake, and no significant uptake.
In the semiquantitative analysis, the mean standardized uptake
value (SUVmean) of the prosthetic area was calculated as the average
maximal SUV adjusted for patient weight measured on 3 adjacent
axial slices in the prosthetic area with the highest 18F-FDG uptake.
SUVmean of blood was calculated as the average SUVmean in 3 adjacent
axial slices within the right atrium in areas devoid of significant spillover
activity from adjacent tissues. Prosthetic-valve–to–background ratio was
calculated by dividing the SUVmean of the prosthetic area by the
SUVmean of blood measured in the right atria.
Leukocyte Scintigraphy
Granulocyte Radiolabeling. Leukocytes were labeled with 99mTc
using the recommended method (11). Briefly, 50 mL of whole blood
were withdrawn from the patient into a syringe containing 10 mL of
acid-citrate-dextrose anticoagulant solution. Granulocytes were iso￾lated by sequential blood centrifugation. For granulocyte radiolabel￾ing, hexamethyl propylene amine oxime (Ceretec; GE Healthcare)
was labeled with freshly eluted 99mTc (800 MBq) and incubated for
15 min with granulocytes. Radiolabeled granulocytes were separated
from hexamethyl propylene amine oxime by a first centrifugation in
the presence of platelet-rich plasma at 4,000 rpm for 10 min and
a second centrifugation in the presence of plasma at 2,000 rpm for
5 min. Labeling efficiency was measured as a percentage by dividing
the radioactivity of the pellet by the radioactivity of the pellet plus
supernatant. Labeling efficiency was considered adequate if more than
40%. The cells were then resuspended in plasma and injected directly
and slowly into a vein of the patient. The total activity injected ranged
from 400 to 500 MBq.
Imaging Protocol. Scintigraphy was performed 4 and 24 h after
radiolabeled-leukocyte injection. All images were acquired using
a SPECT/CT system (Symbia T2; Siemens). Anteroposterior and
oblique planar acquisitions over the chest were obtained at 4 and 24 h
after injection of radiolabeled leukocytes (low-energy high-resolution
collimators; matrix size, 256 · 256; energy window centered on the
140-keV photopeak of 99mTc using a width of 20%; acquisition time
for each planar acquisition, 900 s at 4 h and 1,200 s at 24 h). SPECT/CT
was performed over the thorax at 4 and 24 h after injection. A 2-slice
CT scan was first acquired over the thorax with a tube current of 110 kV
and an intensity of 40–60 mA and was followed by a dual-head SPECT
acquisition (matrix size, 128 · 128; 32 projections per detector; 60 s
per projection). Images were reconstructed using an ordered-subset
expectation maximization algorithm with a Butterworth filter, a cutoff
frequency of 1.35 cycles/cm, and 8 iterations without and with atten￾uation correction based on low-dose CT acquisitions. Transverse, sag￾ittal, and coronal slices of SPECT data were merged with CT using
a dedicated workstation (Syngo; Siemens). The radiation dose asso￾ciated with this imaging protocol was 8 mSv.
Interpretation Criteria. Planar and SPECT/CT acquisitions were
analyzed using the Xeleris workstation (GE Healthcare) by an ex￾perienced nuclear medicine physician masked to the results of 18F￾FDG PET and to patient outcome. Scintigraphy results were classified
as positive when foci of labeled leukocyte uptake greater than back￾ground activity were detected in the cardiac area and when contrast
between these foci and background signal increased over time. Foci of
nonphysiologic abnormal uptake that decreased after 24 h were con￾sidered nonspecific.
Diagnosis of PVE
The final diagnosis was made by experienced cardiologists accord￾ing to the clinical and echocardiographic evolution of the patient
during a 3-mo follow-up after admission, as well as the presence of an
alternate diagnosis explaining the initial infectious syndrome, and was
based on the clinical or pathologic modified Duke–Li criteria (10). For
patients who underwent surgery after imaging, any visual observations
of the cardiac surgeon during the intervention were included in his
final report and collected.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using MedCalc software. Com￾parisons of values measured in 2 different groups were 2-sided and
performed with the Student t test when the number of values
was more than 25 and with the Wilcoxon test when the number of
values was less than 25. A P value of less than 0.05 was considered
significant.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Thirty-nine patients (17 women and 22 men) aged 62 6 17 y
underwent leukocyte scintigraphy and 18F-FDG PET imaging. Patient
characteristics are detailed in Tables 1 and 2. The patients were
imaged on average 45 mo (range, 14 d to 24 y) after open-chest cardiac
surgery. The average time between 18F-FDG PET and leukocyte
scintigraphy acquisitions was 7 6 7 d. Of the 39 patients, 14 were
classified before imaging as having definite IE, 19 as having possible
IE, and 6 as not having IE based on the modified Duke–Li clas￾sification. Antibiotherapy had been started in 28 patients (72%)
before imaging. In these patients, the median duration of antibiotic
therapy before 18F-FDG PET imaging and leukocyte scintigraphy
was not statistically different (15 d [range, 3–326 d] vs. 18 d
[range, 3–308 d], P 5 0.98). After 3 mo of follow-up, 14 patients
were classified as having definite IE, 4 as having possible IE, and
21 as not having IE based on the modified Duke–Li classification.
Performance of 18F-FDG PET Imaging
Among the 39 consecutive patients who underwent 18F-FDG
PET, 21 (54%) were considered to have positive results. Sensitiv￾ity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value,
and accuracy for the diagnosis of PVE were 93%, 71%, 68%, 94%,
and 80%, respectively. Myocardial 18F-FDG uptake was graded as
elevated, mild, or low in 10 patients (26%), 11 patients (28%), and
18 patients (46%), respectively.
Among the 21 patients with positive 18F-FDG PET results, the
final classification at 3 mo was definite IE for 13, possible IE for 2,
and no IE for 6. SUVmean at the site of suspected endocarditis was
6.5 (range, 3.9–14.7) in patients with definite IE, 4.4 (range, 4.0–4.8)
in patients with possible IE, and 4.9 (range, 3.3–6.2) in patients
with no IE (P 5 0.08 for the comparison of SUV in patients with
definite vs. no IE). Prosthetic-valve–to–background ratios at the
site of suspected endocarditis were 4.1 (range, 2.3–7.8) in patients
with definite IE, 2.5 (range, 2.3–2.7) in patients with possible IE,
and 3.4 (range, 2.4–4.4) in patients with no IE (P 5 0.24 for the
comparison of prosthetic-valve–to–background ratio in patients
with definite vs. no IE). All patients with an SUVmean greater than
6.2 and a prosthetic-valve–to–background ratio greater than 4.4 in
the area of suspected endocarditis were classified as having defi￾nite PVE. Septic emboli were identified in 5 patients (24%) with
positive 18F-FDG PET results. Among the 6 patients with positive 18F-FDG PET results who underwent surgery, PVE was confirmed
in 5 patients by positive cultures of cardiac material; the remaining
patient had valve dehiscence 1 mo after the initial surgery without
evidence of infection. All patients in whom 18F-FDG PET results

were positive and endocarditis was excluded (n 5 6) were imaged
in the first 2 mo after cardiac surgery (median, 33 d; range, 14–47 d).
Among the 18 patients with negative 18F-FDG PET results, the
final classification at 3 mo was no IE for 15, possible IE for 2, and
definite IE for 1. Three patients with negative results underwent sur￾gery, and PVE was excluded. The only patient with confirmed IE and
negative 18F-FDG PET results was infected with Lactobacillus sp.
Performance of Leukocyte Scintigraphy
Among the 39 consecutive patients who underwent leukocyte
scintigraphy, 9 (23%) were considered to have positive results. Sen￾sitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive
value, and accuracy for the diagnosis of PVE were 64%, 100%,
100%, 81%, and 86%, respectively.
The 9 patients with positive results on leukocyte scintigraphy
were classified as having definite IE. Among the 3 patients with
positive results who underwent surgery, all were confirmed to have
PVE and an abscess.
Among the 30 patients with negative results on leukocyte scintig￾raphy, the final classification at 3 mo was no IE for 21, possible IE
for 4, and definite IE for 5. Six patients with negative results
underwent surgery: PVE was excluded in 4 but was definite in 2.
These 2 patients had PVE with nonpyogenic germs (Coxiella burnetti
and Candida).
Comparison of 18F-FDG PET and Leukocyte Scintigraphy
The results of 18F-FDG PET and leukocyte scintigraphy were
discrepant in 12 patients (31%). Of patients with definite IE, 5 had
results that were true-positive on 18F-FDG PET but false-negative
on leukocyte scintigraphy (Fig. 1). Of these 5 patients, 3 had IE
with nonpyogenic microorganisms (Coxiella or Candida). The 2
remaining patients showed no signs of abscess on transesophageal
echocardiography and had a favorable outcome under antibiother￾apy. Of the patients in whom endocarditis had been excluded,
6 had results that were true-negative on leukocyte scintigraphy
but false-positive on 18F-FDG PET (Fig. 2). These 6 patients had
been imaged in the first 2 mo after the last cardiac surgery. When
patients imaged in the first 2 mo after cardiac surgery (n 5 9) were
excluded from the analysis, sensitivity, specificity, positive pre￾dictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy for the di￾agnosis of PVE were 57%, 100%, 100%, 67%, and 77%, respec￾tively, for leukocyte scintigraphy and 92%, 100%, 100%, 93%,
and 96%, respectively, for 18F-FDG PET. The last patient with a
discrepancy between 18F-FDG PET and leukocyte scintigraphy
was classified as having possible endocarditis and was positive
on 18F-FDG PET and negative on leukocyte scintigraphy.
Among patients classified with definite PVE caused by pyogenic
germs, patients with positive leukocyte scintigraphy results had
a nonstatistically significant higher 18F-FDG uptake in the valvular
area (Fig. 3) than did patients with negative leukocyte scintigraphy
results (SUVmean, 7.1 [range, 4.1–14.7] vs. 5.9 [range, 4.0–9.3];
prosthetic-valve–to–background ratio, 4.7 [range, 2.4 27.8] vs.
2.9 [range, 2.3–4.1], P 5 0.21 and 0.17, respectively).
The performance of an imaging strategy consisting of perform￾ing leukocyte scintigraphy in patients with positive 18F-FDG PET
results in the first 2 mo after cardiac surgery was evaluated in this
cohort of patients. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value,
negative predictive value, and accuracy for the diagnosis of PVE
based on this imaging strategy were 93%, 100%, 100%, 95%, and
97%, respectively. After 18F-FDG PET and leukocyte scintigraphy,
18 patients (46%) were correctly reclassified in the modified Duke–Li
classification (Table 3).
DISCUSSION
In the present study, the performance of 18F-FDG PET and leu￾kocyte scintigraphy for the diagnosis of PVE was evaluated in patients
who underwent the 2 imaging modalities for clinical indications.
This study confirmed the high sensitivity of 18F-FDG PET for the
FIGURE 1. Representative example of patient with true-positive 18F￾FDG PET findings and false-negative leukocyte scintigraphy findings. A
37-y-old woman was admitted for ischemic stroke. She had a history of
rheumatoid valve disease with mitral valve replacement by mechanical
prosthesis 1 y earlier. Transesophageal echocardiography revealed 10-
mm-long mobile mass appended to mitral valve and new mild perivalvular
mitral regurgitation. No criterion for endocarditis was present in blood
cultures or serologies. Intense 18F-FDG uptake was detected on attenuation￾corrected PET images (arrowhead) and in prosthetic mitral valve on axial
PET/CT images. In same patient, no significant accumulation of radio￾labeled leukocytes was detected in cardiac region on axial reconstructed
SPECT images (arrow), in particular in the mitral valve area located using
SPECT/CT. Patient underwent repeated surgery with excision of all
material because of progression of partial valve dehiscence. Bacteriology
of prosthetic valve confirmed active infection with Coxiella burneti.

and large vegetations and underwent urgent repeated surgery. Trans￾esophageal echocardiography performed 40 d after intervention revealed
presence of mild perivalvular regurgitation. No criterion for endocarditis
was present in blood cultures under antibiotherapy. Moderate 18F-FDG
uptake was detected on attenuation-corrected PET images (arrowhead)
and around prosthetic aortic valve on axial PET/CT images. In same patient,
no significant accumulation of radiolabeled leukocytes was detected in
cardiac region on axial reconstructed SPECT images (arrow), in particular
in the aortic valve area located using SPECT/CT. Patient remained
asymptomatic and did not have any recurrent endocarditis 6 mo later.

diagnosis of endocarditis in patients with suspected PVE. False￾positive 18F-FDG PET results were, however, identified in the first
2 mo after open-chest cardiac surgery, probably as a consequence of
inflammatory reactions taking place in the early stages after implantation
of foreign material. In comparison to 18F-FDG PET, leukocyte scintig￾raphy demonstrated lower sensitivity but higher specificity for the
detection of PVE. This imaging technique therefore seems particularly
interesting for evaluating patients with suspected PVE in the first 2 mo
after cardiac surgery or in cases of inconclusive 18F-FDG PET results.
Performance of 18F-FDG PET Imaging for Detection of PVE
18F-FDG PET imaging presents several advantages for the eval￾uation of patients with suspected PVE. First, PET acquisitions are
performed only 1 h after the injection of 18F-FDG. This translates
into high activities in tissues, good image quality, and short acquisition
times. Second, 18F-FDG PET has become widely available. Third,
whole-body 18F-FDG PET acquisitions can help to identify the
origin of the infection and the presence of septic emboli. However,
18F-FDG PET presents certain limitations for the evaluation of patients
with suspected PVE. The presence of intense myocardial uptake
can hamper analysis of the contours of a valvular prosthesis, par￾ticularly in the mitral position. In the current study, suppression of
physiologic 18F-FDG uptake was obtained by 12 h of fasting and
preparation with a low-carbohydrate, high-fat meal before imaging.
Myocardial 18F-FDG uptake was classified as low or mild in 75% of
the patients using this protocol and did not represent an important
limitation for the PET evaluation of cardiac valves. Furthermore,
18F-FDG uptake is often present in noninfected grafts or material
wherein chronic aseptic inflammation is taking place and can be
difficult to discriminate from an infectious process (12). In this study, 18F-FDG uptake caused by inflammatory reactions in prostheses rep￾resented an important issue especially in patients imaged in the first
2 mo after open-chest cardiac surgery, because the intensity of the
radiotracer uptake in inflammatory tissues during this period can be
high and similar to that in infected tissues. Later after the surgery,
the intensity of inflammation around prostheses tends to decrease and
can therefore be more easily discriminated from infective processes.
Performance of Leukocyte Scintigraphy for Detection of PVE
In previous work (8,9), leukocyte scintigraphy demonstrated an
excellent specificity for the detection of perivalvular infection and
abscesses in patients with suspected PVE. In addition, the intensity
of perivalvular radiolabeled leukocyte accumulation on scintigraphy
allows for the evaluation of local and extended infectious activity
and therefore represents an interesting prognostic marker in patients
with PVE (8). However, leukocyte scintigraphy has some important
limitations for the evaluation of patients with suspected PVE. First,
radiolabeling of leukocytes involves direct handling of blood products.
FIGURE 3. Representative example of patient with true-positive 18F￾FDG PET findings and true-positive leukocyte scintigraphy findings. A
60-y-old man was admitted for fever associated with Staphylococcus
aureus septicemia. He had a history of aortic aneurysm of ascending
thoracic aorta treated 2 y earlier by aortic valve replacement with bi￾ologic prosthesis and replacement of ascending aorta. Transesopha￾geal echocardiography did not show any criteria for endocarditis. In￾tense 18F-FDG uptake was detected on attenuation-corrected PET
images (arrowhead) and around aortic tube on axial PET/CT images.
In same patient, diffuse accumulation of radiolabeled leukocytes was
detected on axial reconstructed SPECT images (arrow) and along aortic
tube on SPECT/CT images, corresponding to area identified on 18F￾FDG PET images. On basis of results of both types of scintigraphy,
patient underwent repeated surgery with excision of all material. Intra￾operative analysis confirmed presence of pus around aortic tube, and
valve culture was positive for Staphylococcus aureus.

Second, leukocyte scintigraphy, as compared with 18F-FDG PET, offers
a lower sensitivity for the detection of PVE, which can be explained
by several factors: the spatial resolution and sensitivity are intrinsically
lower in single-photon g cameras than in PET systems; the signal
detected with leukocyte scintigraphy is weak because acquisitions
are performed 24 h after injection of 99mTc-radiolabeled leukocytes;
accumulation of leukocytes is high in active abscesses but weak in
vegetations or drained abscesses; and only granulocytes were radio￾labeled for leukocyte scintigraphy in the present study. Patients with
Q fever or Candida endocarditis show, on histologic examination,
an infiltration consisting mostly of lymphocytes and monocytes in
the cardiac valves (13,14), possibly explaining why leukocyte scintigraphy
was falsely negative in the 3 patients with nonpyogenic germs (2
patients infected with Coxiella burnetii and 1 patient with Candida).
Imaging Strategy in Patients with Suspected PVE and
Inconclusive Echocardiography Results
Because of its high sensitivity, 18F-FDG PET is well suited as
the first-line imaging technique in patients with suspected PVE and
inconclusive echocardiography results. In patients with negative
18F-FDG PET results, the probability of PVE is low. In patients
showing intense 18F-FDG uptake in the cardiac valves on PET
(prosthetic-valve–to–background ratio . 4.4 in this study), the
probability of infection is high. In the presence of mild, diffuse
18F-FDG uptake around cardiac prostheses, the diagnosis of in￾fection can be difficult, particularly in patients imaged early after
cardiac surgery. In these cases, leukocyte scintigraphy seems to
represent a useful imaging technique to discriminate between in￾fective and inflammatory processes in the cardiac valves. Indeed,
the specificity for the identification of PVE increased in this study
from 71% when only 18F-FDG PET imaging was considered to
100% when a combination of the 2 imaging techniques was used.
Even though this point was not evaluated in the current study, in
our experience PET images can also be useful for the analysis of
leukocyte scintigraphy: identification of regions with high 18F-FDG
uptake on PET helped to localize the cardiac areas that should be
evaluated on corresponding leukocyte scintigraphy images.
Limitations of the Study
This study had some limitations. First, the study was mono￾centric, and the diagnostic performance of leukocyte scintigraphy
and 18F-FDG PET was measured using physicians trained to eval￾uate PVE with scintigraphy. In our experience, integrating clinical
history with echocardiography and scintigraphy results is the key
to improving the accuracy of these imaging techniques. Second,
patients evaluated in this study represented only a selection pre￾senting with suspected PVE. Only patients who benefited from both
18F-FDG PET imaging and leukocyte scintigraphy for clinical in￾dications were included in this study. The diagnostic performance
of each imaging modality in this study was, however, similar to
previous findings (6,9), except for the sensitivity of radiolabeled
leukocyte scintigraphy for the diagnosis of endocarditis, which was
lower in this study (64%) than in the study of Erba et al. (90%) (9). 18F-FDG PET was performed on all patients in this study and has
been shown to dramatically improve sensitivity for the diagnosis
of PVE (6). The fact that additional patients were diagnosed with
PVE because of 18F-FDG PET imaging could explain the lower
sensitivity of leukocyte scintigraphy in this study. Third, the pres￾ence of PVE in patients with positive 18F-FDG PET results in the
first 2 mo after cardiac surgery cannot be formally excluded on the
basis of the modified Duke–Li probability score. Early PVE is, how￾ever, often associated with poor outcome. The good clinical evo￾lution of these 6 patients during follow-up represents an additional
clue against the presence of infection. Finally, the performance of
a sequential strategy consisting of 18F-FDG PET as first-line imaging
and leukocyte scintigraphy as second-line imaging for the diagnosis
of PVE has been extracted from a relatively small, selected group of
patients. This approach, though promising, needs to be validated
prospectively in a larger group of patients with suspected PVE.
CONCLUSION
In summary, 18F-FDG PET offers high sensitivity for the detection
of active infection in patients with suspected PVE and inconclusive
echocardiography findings and represents a useful first-line imaging
technique in this situation. Leukocyte scintigraphy, however, offers
higher specificity than 18F-FDG PET for the diagnosis of PVE. In
this study, a sequential strategy consisting of performing 18F-FDG
PET imaging initially and following it with leukocyte scintigraphy
when the former was inconclusive or when patients had positive
18F-FDG PET results in the first 2 mo after cardiac surgery strongly
improved the diagnosis of PVE. The validity of this imaging strat￾egy in patients with suspected PVE will need to be confirmed in a
prospective clinical study with a larger number of patients.
