SUMMARY
Mucormycosis is a rare angioinvasive fungal infection,
more commonly seen in immunosuppressed patients,
with reported mortality rates of 95% in disseminated
disease. We present a case report of a patient with T-cell
acute lymphoblastic leukaemia who developed
disseminated infection with mucormycosis (involving the
pancreas, left occipital lobe, right lower lobe of lung,
appendix and right kidney) after having completed
induction and consolidation chemotherapy. Growth of
Lichtheimia corymbifera was initially isolated following a
right pleural tap with fungal elements identified
repeatedly on subsequent pathology specimens.
Following radical surgical debridement and concurrent
treatment with combination antifungal therapy, the
patient survived. This case demonstrates that aggressive
multisite surgical de-bulking of disseminated fungal foci,
in conjunction with combination antifungal therapy and
reversal of immunosuppression, can result in survival
despite the grave prognosis associated with disseminated
mucormycosis.
BACKGROUND
Mucormycosis is a disease caused by the filament￾ous fungi of the Mucorales order (class of
Zygomycetes) and are not usually pathogenic to
human beings unless host defences are compro￾mised.1–5 The fungal sporangiospores, which exist
universally in the soil and decaying organic matter,
are typically inhaled or directly inoculated into dis￾rupted skin or mucosa and can germinate in the
immunocompromised host.1–7 Mucormycosis is
associated with extensive angioinvasion, throm￾bosis, tissue infarction and necrosis, followed by
haematogenous dissemination of the fungi.1–5 7
Dissemination occurs in up to 40% of patients with
haematological malignancies8 and it has been
reported that dissemination increases the risk of
death by sevenfold.9
We present a case of disseminated mucormycosis
infection in an immunosuppressed child following
intensive chemotherapy for T-cell acute lympho￾blastic leukaemia (T-ALL). This is the first known
published case of a patient to survive disseminated
mucormycosis with infection in five sites (right
lower lobe (RLL) of lung, appendix, pancreas, left
occipital lobe and right kidney) in response to
prompt reversal of immunosuppression, combin￾ation antifungal therapy and aggressive multisite
surgical de-bulking.
CASE PRESENTATION
An 11-year-old girl was diagnosed with T-ALL in
October 2011. She had completed induction and
consolidation chemotherapy without severe infect￾ive complications. Partway through receiving
delayed intensification chemotherapy (vincristine,
dexamethasone, doxorubicin, polyethylene glycol
asparaginase, intrathecal methotrexate), she devel￾oped severe central abdominal pain (day 0). On
presentation, her neutrophil count was 0.03×109
/L
with raised C reactive protein of 270 mg/L. Lipase
was normal. Urine microscopy and culture were
negative. Serial CT scans (days 1 and 2) revealed
consolidation and ground glass opacification of the
RLL with associated pulmonary artery and vein
thrombosis (figures 1 and 2), a hypodense lesion in
the uncinate process of the pancreas, a lesion in the
left occipital lobe (figure 3) and a lesion within the
upper medial pole of the right kidney (figure 4).
Acute appendicitis was confirmed on day 5
(abdominal ultrasound) and she underwent a laparo￾scopic appendectomy on day 6. An MRI was per￾formed on day 8 to investigate persistent abdominal
pain radiating to the back. This demonstrated an
increase in the size of the lesion in the uncinate
process of the pancreas, with compression of the
inferior vena cava and dilatation of the common bile
duct (CBD) and the major pancreatic duct. She subse￾quently developed acute cholangitis and a well￾defined collection behind the head of pancreas, which
was highly suggestive of a ruptured distal CBD.
INVESTIGATIONS
Pleural fluid aspirate on day 4 from the right
hemithorax grew Lichtheimia corymbifera.
Histopathology of her RLL (resected on day 9) was

consistent with angioinvasive mucor infection, confirming
growth of L corymbifera.
Histopathology of the appendix identified fungal elements
consistent with the appearance of mucormycosis; however, the
culture grew Candida and Rhodotorula species. This was neither
thought to be clinically significant nor was it associated with the
disseminated invasive fungal infection.
Subsequent histopathology specimens (from the left occipital
abscess, right kidney, pancreatic abscess and biliary stent)
demonstrated invasive fungal hyphae with features characteristic
of mucormycosis (table 1, figures 5 and 6).
TREATMENT
Delayed intensification chemotherapy was ceased mid-cycle to
avoid further myelosuppression. She responded well with her
neutrophil count increasing to 1.70×109
/L by day 6.
Given her excellent premorbid functional status and prompt
recovery of the neutrophil count, a decision was made to treat
this disseminated mucormycosis aggressively—utilising combin￾ation antifungal therapy and targeted surgical debridement of
fungal foci.
Antifungal therapy with intravenous liposomal amphotericin
B (L-AMB) was increased from a dose of 5 to10 mg/kg/day.
Caspofungin (70 mg/m2 loading dose then 50 mg/m2
/day) was
also started for its synergistic effect with L-AMB.
Caspofungin was ceased on day 68 and L-AMB therapy was
reduced to a daily regimen of 5 mg/kg/day on day 82. Oral
posaconazole was also introduced at this time; but was discon￾tinued after 3 months due to failure to achieve satisfactory
therapeutic levels. Absorption and resultant bioavailability of
posaconazole is best achieved when taken with a high fat
meal.10 This has not been possible due to erratic oral nutritional
intake secondary to on-going recurrent abdominal pain.
Surgical management has involved: (1) right lower lobectomy,
(2) craniotomy for drainage of her left occipital abscess, (3) left
superior turbinectomy and sphenoidotomy, (4) right nephrec￾tomy (attempted laparoscopic partial nephrectomy converted to
open total nephrectomy), (5) percutaneous drainage of her pan￾creatic abscess plus multiple endoscopic retrograde cholangio￾pancreatography with sphincterotomy and pancreatobiliary
stenting, (6) emergency stenting of (presumed mycotic) superior
mesenteric artery (SMA) aneurysm presenting with sudden
onset of haemodynamic instability and frank haemorrhage
through her peripancreatic drain (day 34) and (7) laparotomy,
cholecystectomy and hepaticoduodenostomy for persistent
biliary leakage from the disrupted distal CBD (day 46).
OUTCOME AND FOLLOW-UP
The patient is currently in remission with no signs of mucormy￾cosis. Her most significant on-going problem is recurrent
abdominal pain that is unexplained. The SMA stent has been
proven to be patent on serial Doppler sonographic scanning.
Multiple replacements of the pancreatic stent have made no dif￾ference to her symptoms. A pancreatic secretin stimulation test
demonstrated normal pancreatic function and did not stimulate
her abdominal pain. At present her abdominal pain is being
managed by the chronic pain service.
DISCUSSION
The true incidence of mucormycosis is unknown, as most epi￾demiological studies are retrospective and therefore limited.1 11
Patients known to be at risk of developing mucormycosis include
those with haematological malignancies, haematopoietic stem
cell transplant recipients, solid organ malignancies, solid organ
transplantation recipients, graft versus host disease, autoimmune
disorders, diabetes mellitus, major trauma, neonatal prematurity
and users of illicit drugs.12457 Mucormycosis infection has
been reported with increasing frequency in immunocomprom￾ised patients with haematological malignancies (8/100 000 in

1989–1993 to 17/100 000 in 1994–1998),1 possibly due to
more aggressive treatments resulting in more severe and pro￾longed postchemotherapeutic neutropenia.1 2 5 8 11–13 The diag￾nosis of mucormycosis is often made at autopsy, representing
8.3–13% of all fungal infections in high-risk patients and has an
incidence of 0.4–0.9% on patients with haematological malig￾nancies.1 3 4 11 The outcome in disseminated infection is dismal,
with up to 95% of all patients not surviving the infection irre￾spective of the antifungal treatment administered.1 2 7 12
Early diagnosis is critical to early therapeutic intervention to
prevent progressive angioinvasion and dissemination, reduce the
extent of surgical resection and improve outcome and sur￾vival.124–6 11 14 Definitive diagnosis must be established by
biopsy and cultures.4 6 Cultures of fresh tissue more frequently
yield a positive result than body fluids or necrotic tissue.2 5
Histology characteristically demonstrates wide non-septate
hyphae that branch at right angles and look empty when stained
withH&E.2 7 11 CT findings may be suggestive of fungal infec￾tion, yet are often non-specific and cannot be distinguished
from other infective causes.4 14
Treating a patient’s underlying medical condition and reso￾lution of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia are also essential
to therapy.5 6 8 11 14 In vitro studies have demonstrated synergis￾tic activity of neutrophils and L-AMB against Mucorales.14 In
our patient’s case, prompt recovery of her neutropenia early in
the course of her disease appeared to play a critical role for her
survival. Granulocyte transfusions can offer support for persist￾ently neutropenic patients until recovery from neutropenia.14
Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor or interferon-γ may help
to further augment the host response and antifungal effect in
non-neutropenic patients with refractory disease.14
Several in vitro studies have proved excellent activity of
amphotericin B against Mucorales and is thus recommended as
first-line therapy.6 8 12 13 The lipid formulation of amphotericin
B is preferred as it is associated with less nephrotoxicity and can
therefore be administered at higher doses for longer periods and
is associated with higher cure rates in central nervous system
(CNS) mucormycosis.6 14 15 The optimal daily dose and length
of treatment of amphotericin B are undefined and it is not clear
whether higher doses lead to improved outcomes.6 13 14

Current guidelines based on pharmacokinetic data recommend
dosing of L-AMB at 5 mg/kg/day, which can be increased to
10 mg/kg/day in patients with CNS involvement.14
There is limited evidence for combination antifungal therapy
of L-AMB with caspofungin (an echinocandin). Its synergistic
activity has been demonstrated in murine models with dissemi￾nated mucormycosis, when compared with monotherapy or
placebo.6 14 16 Superior outcomes have also been suggested in
retrospective clinical studies with combination caspofungin and
L-AMB therapy for rhino-orbital-cerebral mucormycosis.14 The
new extended-spectrum triazole antifungal agent, posaconazole,
has shown to have significant activity against mucormycosis and
may have the potential for clinical development in the treatment
of mucormycosis.5 7 9 15 Overall success rates of 60–70% (com￾plete plus partial response) have been reported from retrospect￾ive case series when used as salvage therapy in combination
with amphotericin B for mucormycosis.9 14 Guidelines from the
Third European Conference on Infections in Leukaemia (ECIL
3) recommend that L-AMB in conjunction with posaconazole is
reserved as second-line therapy for patients with mucormycosis
who are refractory or intolerant to L-AMB (level B II
evidence).6
Surgery, independent of concurrent L-AMB therapy, has been
demonstrated to improve survival.6 8 13 The most comprehen￾sive systematic review by ECIL 3, examining 929 published
cases between 1885 and 2005, found that patients treated with
antifungal therapy and surgery had significantly improved mor￾tality rates than those treated with L-AMB alone (70% vs 57%,
respectively).6 This agrees with the findings of a review of 255
cases of pulmonary mucormycosis published by Tedder et al2
who reported that the mortality rate was significantly lower for
patients who underwent surgery than for those who received
medical treatment only (9.4% vs 50%, p=0.01). 11 This is
further supported by a systematic review by Zaoutis et al9 who
found that antifungal therapy combined with surgery signifi￾cantly reduced the risk of death by 84%. It is also noteworthy
that those patients treated aggressively with L-AMB combined
with surgical debridement were able to tolerate further intensive
chemotherapies without relapse of infection.11 ECIL 3 recom￾mends the timely maximal debridement of infected tissue, par￾ticularly in rhino-cerebral, skin and soft tissue disease (level A II
evidence), to reduce the fungal load and prevent extension,
angioinvasion and dissemination of mucormycosis.6
In conclusion, we believe the factors contributing to the
effective treatment of disseminated mucormycosis and survival
of our patient were: (1) a high index of clinical suspicion of dis￾seminated fungal infection, therefore prompting vigorous micro￾biological isolation and diagnosis; (2) early intensive
combination antifungal therapy with high-dose parenteral
L-AMB and caspofungin; (3) radical surgical debridement of
fungal foci and (4) prompt resolution of her neutropenia follow￾ing the suspension of myelosuppressive agents. This agrees with
the consensus upon review of the literature.6 13

Learning points
▸ Mucormycosis is a rare fungal infection predominantly seen
in immunocompromised patients with high mortality rates of
up to 95% in disseminated disease.
▸ Improved prognosis can be achieved with early diagnosis
based on a high clinical index of suspicion and
microbiological isolation of mucormycosis infection, recovery
of underlying immunosuppression and prompt intensive
treatment.
▸ Early intensive treatment with combination antifungal
therapy with high-dose parenteral liposomal amphotericin B
and caspofungin, aggressive surgical resection of fungal foci
and reversal of immunosuppression are imperative to
improve chances of survival.
