Abstract
Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate a lot of physiological and pathological processes, including myocardial
ischemia/reperfusion. Recent studies reported that knockdown of miR-92a could attenuate ischemia/reperfusion-induced
myocardial injury. In the present study, we examined the potential anti-apoptotic effects of miR-92a in a rat myocardiocyte
cell line, and the possible role of Smad7 in such actions.
Methodology and Results: In a preliminary bioinformatic analysis, we identified SMAD family member 7 (Smad7) as a
potential target for miR-92a. A luciferase reporter assay indeed demonstrated that miR-92a could inhibit Smad7 expression.
Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion was simulated in rat H9c2 cells with 24-h hypoxia followed by 12-h reoxygenation. Prior to
hypoxia/reoxygenation, cells were transfected by miR-92a inhibitor. In some experiments, cells were co-transfected with
siRNA-Smad7. The miR-92a inhibitor dramatically reduced the release of lactate dehydrogenase and malonaldehyde, and
attenuated cardiomyocyte apoptosis. The miR-92a inhibitor increased SMAD7 protein level and decreased nuclear NF-kB
p65 protein. Effects of the miR-92a inhibitor were attenuated by co-transfection with siRNA-Smad7.
Conclusion: Inhibiting miR-92a can attenuate myocardiocyte apoptosis induced by hypoxia/reoxygenation by targeting
Smad7.

Introduction
Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury contributes to the
damage after ischemic events in patients with coronary heart
disease (CHD) [1,2]. I/R injury is also implicated in cardiac
procedures that require cardio-pulmonary bypass, and in CHD
patients receiving percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary
artery bypass surgery. I/R injury is mediated by a variety of
factors, including oxidative stress, intracellular Ca2+ overload,
rapid restoration of physiological pH upon reperfusion, the
mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP), and exagger￾ated inflammation [3].
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of endogenous, small non￾coding single-stranded RNAs, typically 18–24 nucleotides in
length, that negatively regulate gene expression through binding
to the 39-untranslated region (UTR) of target mRNAs [4].
MiRNAs play critical roles in a variety of heart diseases, including
cardiac hypertrophy [5], heart failure [6], arrhythmia [7],
myocardial infarction [8] and I/R injury [9]. Growing evidence
also supports a pivotal role for miR-92a in multiple processes,
including tumorigenesis and metastasis [10], cell proliferation and
apoptosis [11]. In the study, we found that transfection with miR￾92a inhibitor could attenuate myocardial injury and apoptosis
induced by hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) in cultured rat H9c2
myocardiocytes cells. A preliminary bioinformatics analysis
identified Smad7 as a target for miR-92a. Accordingly, we also
examined the possible involvement of Smad7 in the protective
action of miR-92a.
Materials and Methods
Cell Culture
The H9c2 cells (ventricular myocardiocyte, rat in origin; Cell
Bank of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China) were
seeded at a density of 26104 cells/cm2 in 6-well plates and
cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, Sigma,
St. Louis, MO, USA) containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum
(FBS, HyClone, Logan, UT, USA) in a humidified atmosphere of
95% air and 5% CO2 at 37uC.

Transient Transfection with Oligonucleotides
Transfection was carried out using Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The ratio of oligonucleotide
vs. the Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent was 1:5. MiR-92a
mimic, inhibitor and matched negative control (NC) were
synthesized by GenePharma, Shanghai, China. For RNA inter￾ference, cells were transiently transfected with a siRNA specific for
Smad7 or NC (GenePharma). All transfections were carried out
after 12-h serum starvation, and lasted for 48-h prior to the H/R
experiments.
H/R in H9c2 Cardiomyocytes
Hypoxia was induced by exposing the cells to 1% O2, 94% N2,
and 5% CO2 for 24 h using a modular incubator (Model 3131,
Forma Scientific, Marietta, OH, USA). Reoxygenation (95% air,
5% CO2, 37uC) lasted for 12 h. Cells under normoxia throughout
the experiments were included as a control. All experiments were
repeated three times.
Quantitative Real-time Polymerase Chain reaction (qRT￾PCR)
Total RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen).
Bulge-loop miRNA qRT-PCR primer sets (one RT primer and a
pair of qRT-PCR primers for each set) specific for miR-17, miR￾18a, miR-19a, miR-20a, miR-19b and miR-92a were designed by
RiboBio (Guangzhou, China). MiRNAs were reverse transcribed
using the stem-loop RT primer. The primers for Smad7 were also
designed by RiboBio. qRT-PCR was carried out to examine the
expression of specific miRNAs or mRNA on a Rotor-Gene 3,000
real-time DNA detection system (Corbett Research, Sydney,
Australia) using SYBR Green (Qiagen, Shanghai, China). All
samples were analyzed in triplicate. Gene expression was
determined by comparing the data against the standard curve,
and normalized against U6.
Determination of Cell Injury and Apoptosis
Structural integrity of cultured H9c2 cardiomyocytes was
evaluated by measuring the concentration of lactate dehydroge￾nase (LDH) and malonaldehyde (MDA) in the culture media by
ELISA using an automatic biochemical analyzer (Model 7150,
Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). Apoptosis was detected by annexinV￾FITC/propidium iodide (AV/PI) dual staining (Bender MedSys￾tems, Burlingame, CA, USA).
DNA Constructs and Reporter Gene Assays
To examine whether miR-92a regulates the expression of
Smad7, we used a dual luciferase psiCheck-2 reporter plasmid
(Promega, Madison, WI, USA) to generate a reporter plasmid
harboring the Smad7 39-UTR. For luciferase reporter experiments,
the 39UTR of the Smad7 gene was amplified by PCR from rat
genomic DNA and cloned into psiCHECK-2 (Promega) between
the Not1 and Sgf1 sites. The construct with a mutated targeting
fragment (TATACCG) in the 39-UTR of Smad7 lacking the
putative miR-92a binding sequence was used as a mutated control.
293T cells were co-transfected with psiCheck2 containing the
Smad7 39-UTR and the miR-92a mimic using Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen). Co-transfection with non-targeting negative control
RNA was performed as a control. The cells were harvested 24 h
after transfection for luciferase activity using a dual luciferase
reporter assay kit (Promega) on a luminometer (Lumat LB9507).
Immunocytochemistry
Cultured H9c2 cardiomyocytes were fixed in 4% paraformal￾dehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton. Cells were blocked
with 3% BSA and incubated with 1000-fold diluted primary
antibody against SMAD7 (ab90085; Abcam; Cambridge, MA,
USA) overnight, and then stained with fluorochrome- conjugated
secondary antibody for another 60 min. Cells were mounted in
Vectashield mounting medium containing 49,69-diamidino-2-
phenylindole (DAPI) to visualize nuclei. Images were captured
using a fluorescence laser scanning confocal microscope (FV1000,
Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).
Western Blotting Assays
Cells were harvested in RIPA lysis buffer (Bioteke Co, Beijing,
China) containing 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and
centrifuged at 12,0006g for 15 min at 4uC. Whole cell lysate
was used for SMAD7 detection. Cytosolic and nuclear fractions
were prepared using standard nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction
reagents (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA). Protein
concentration was measured using the Bio-Rad method. Samples
(20 mg protein) were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and trans￾ferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were
blocked with 5% non-fat milk in TBST buffer (100 mM NaCl,
10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1% Tween-20) for 1 h prior to
incubation with a primary antibody against SMAD7 (1:1000;
ab90085; Abcam), NF-kB p65 (1:1000; ab7970; Abcam), GAPDH
(1:2500; ab7970; Abcam) or lamin B1 (1:1000; #13435; Cell
Signaling Technology; Boston, MA, USA) at 4uC overnight,
followed by incubation with an appropriate peroxidase-conjugated
secondary antibody (1:1000 dilution). Signal was visualized by
chemiluminescence (Odyssey Li-COR) using GAPDH as a
control. In the case of nuclear NF-kB p65, lamin B1 was
employed as the loading control. Band intensity was assessed using
Quantity one 4.6.2 software.
Statistics and Data Analysis
All data are expressed as the mean6SEM. Comparisons
between groups were made by one-way analysis of variance or
two-tailed student’s t-test. Differences were considered statistically
significant at P,0.05. SPSS software version 19.0 (SPSS, Chicago,
IL, USA) was used for data analysis. All experiments were
performed at least three times.

Results
MiR-17-92 Expression Profiles in H/R H9c2
Cardiomyocytes
In our previous study [12], we found that miR-17, miR-19a,
miR-20a, miR-19b and miR-92a, but not miR-18a, were highly
expressed in the heart of C57BL/6 mice. In the current study, the
expression of the miR-17-92 cluster was up-regulated in H/R
H9c2 cardiomyocytes: the expression of miR-92a was significantly
up-regulated by 2.78-fold over the control (P,0.01 vs. control)
(Figure 1). Based on the most remarkable change in response to
hypoxia/reoxygenation as reflected by qRT-PCR, miR-92a was
selected for subsequent experiments.

transfected with miR-92a inhibitor or siRNA-Smad7 with Lipofectamine2000 for 2 days. The cells were then harvested for measurement. Mock
transfection (transfection agent without RNA) and non-targeting negative control were used as controls. The expression levels of miR-92a and Smad7
mRNA were determined using qRT-PCR, normalized to U6, and expressed as the fold change relative to the control (**P,0.01 vs. control).

Efficiency of RNA Interference
Transfection of miR-92a inhibitor significantly decreased the
level of miR-92a in cultured H9c2 cells under normoxic
conditions, respectively (Figure 2A). At 50 nM, the miR-92a
inhibitor significantly down-regulated miR-92a by 2.4360.06-fold
(P,0.01 vs. control). Neither mock nor NC RNA transfection
affected miR-92a expression under normoxic cultures. Based on
such preliminary experiments, 50 nM was chosen for subsequent
experiments. At 100 nM, siRNA-Smad7 significantly decreased
Smad7 expression by 3.3260.13-fold (P,0.01 vs. control)
(Figure 2B).
Inhibition of miR-92a Protects against H/R-induced Injury
and Apoptosis
H/R treatment increased LDH in the culture media
(16.3660.74 vs. 8.1660.47 ng/mL in normoxic condition, P,
0.01) (Figure 3A). The miR-92a inhibitor significantly decreased
LDH release in response to H/R (10.9361.35 ng/mL, P,0.01 vs.
the H/R group). Co-transfection with siRNA-Smad7 attenuated
the effects of the miR-92a inhibitor.
H/R treatment increased MDA release (38.8363.70 vs.
20.3362.05 ng/mL in normoxic condition, P,0.01) (Figure 3B).
The H/R-induced MDA release was significantly decreased by the
miR-92a inhibitor (26.9361.59 ng/mL, P,0.01 vs. the H/R
group). The observed effects of the miR-92a inhibitor were also
attenuated by co-transfection with siRNA-Smad7.

The AV/PI dual staining (Figure 4A) revealed increased
apoptosis upon H/R (27.8061.77% vs. 7.2360.40% under
normoxic condition, P,0.01) (Figure 4B). Transfection with
miR-92a inhibitor significantly decreased the percentage of
apoptosis induced by H/R (18.5662.08%, P,0.01 vs. the H/R
group). The effects of miR-92a inhibitor were attenuated by co￾transfection with siRNA-Smad7.
H/R treatment also significantly increased the percentage of
necrotic cells (8.5661.10 vs. 1.5660.25% in the control; P,0.01)
(Figure 4C). Transfection with miR-92a inhibitor significantly
decreased the percentage of necrosis induced by H/R
(6.1660.35%, P,0.05 vs. the H/R group). The effects of miR￾92a inhibitor were also attenuated by co-transfection with siRNA￾Smad7.
Smad7 is a Target of miR-92a
Bioinformatic analysis using MiRanda, miRDB, miRwalk and
TargetScan suggested Smad7 as a target of miR-92a. Specifically,

the 39-UTR of the Smad7 mRNA contains one binding site for
miR-92a (Figure 5A).
In comparison with the mutated control, the miR-92a mimic
reduced the activity of the luciferase reporter fused with the Smad7
39-UTR by 41% (Figure 5B). Inmunocytofluorescent staining
(Figure 6) revealed very low level of SMAD7 in cells exposed to the
H/R treatment. The protein level of SMAD7 was increased by the
miR-92a inhibitor.
The miR-92a inhibitor did not affect the level of Smad7 mRNA
(Figure 7A). Co-transfection with siRNA-Smad7 significantly
decreased the level of Smad7 mRNA (P,0.01). Western blotting
(Figure 7B) revealed increased level of SMAD7 by the miR-92a
inhibitor (in comparison to H/R alone, P,0.05). The effects of
miR-92a inhibitor were attenuated by co-transfection with siRNA￾Smad7.
Cytosolic NF-kB p65 was not affected by transfection with miR￾92a inhibitor, or co-transfection with miR-92a inhibitor and
siRNA-Smad7 (Figure 7C). Nuclear NF-kB p65 was significantly
decreased by the miR-92a inhibitor (in comparison with H/R
alone, P,0.05). The effects of the miR-92a inhibitor on nuclear
NF-kB p65 were attenuated by co-transfection with siRNA-Smad7
(Figure 7D).
Discussion
Apoptosis plays a crucial role in myocardial I/R injury [13,14].
A number of miRNAs, including miR-1 [15], miR-15b [16], miR￾21 [17] and miR-145 [18], have been implicated in myocardial I/
R injury due to their effects on key genes associated with apoptosis.
MiR-92a has been implicated in myocardial I/R injury in variety
of experimental models. Bonauer et al. demonstrated that the
expression level of miR-92a was up-regulated 24 h after coronary
artery ligation in mice [19]. They also showed that injection of
antagomir-92a after permanent coronary artery ligation in mice
improved left ventricular function, reduced myocardial infarction
size and apoptosis, and increased the number of new blood vessels,
especially in the border areas of the infarction. Hinkel and
colleagues demonstrated that inhibiting miR-92a protects against
myocardial I/R injury in a porcine model [20].
Studies of miRNAs in various models of myocardial I/R injury
[21–24] indicated varying changes of miRNA expression across
different species, indicating the complexity of miRNA responses,
as well as the complexity of miRNA functions. For example,
Hinkel et al demonstrated that inhibition of miR-92a significantly
reduced I/R-induced cell apoptosis and necrosis in HL-1 cells
[20]. Conversely, Bonauer et al. reported antagomir-92a did not
affect cell apoptosis induced by I/R in cultured neonatal
ventricular cardiomyocytes from Wistar rats [19]. Zhang et al.
demonstrated that both overexpression and down-regulation of
miR-92a could have pro-angiogenic effects in human umbilical
endothelial cells (HUVEC) [25].
In the current study, cultured H9c2 cardiomyocytes were
subjected to 24-h hypoxia followed by 12-h reoxygenation. qRT￾PCR analysis revealed increased expression of all miRNAs in the
miR-17-92 cluster upon H/R treatment. Increased expression of
miR-92a was the most prominent at 2.78-fold.
The present study showed that the inhibition of miR-92a could
significantly reduce H/R-induced myocardiocyte injury and
apoptosis. Based on bioinformatic analyses, Smad7 was identified
as a target of miR-92a. Such a prediction was confirmed by a dual
luciferase reporter assay.
Through imperfect sequence-specific binding to the 39-UTR of
target mRNAs, miRNAs down-regulate gene expression by
degrading target mRNAs [26,27] and/or inhibiting translation
[28]. The present study demonstrated that inhibition of miR-92a
significantly increased protein levels of SMAD7, but did not affect
Smad7 mRNA levels, indicating that miR-92a inhibits the protein
translation at the post-transcriptional level, but does not promote
Smad7 mRNA degradation.
SMAD7 is an important transcriptional factor that regulates the
expression of apoptosis-related genes involved in myocardial I/R
injury [29,30]. SMAD7 protects against apoptosis through
inhibiting the NF-kB signaling pathway [31,32]. Put together,
our findings suggest that apoptosis in myocardial I/R injury, is
mediated, at least partly, through the miR-92a/Smad7/NF-kB
p65 pathway.
Despite of our findings, whether Smad7 is the most important
target of miR-92a in cardiomyocytes (and thus the therapeutic
potentials) remains unknown. Other potential candidates included
(but not limited to) Pten and MKK4 [33,34] Also, the current
study did not provide direct evidence for the interaction between
Smad7 and NF-kB p65. Another limitation of the current study is
the use of myocardiocytes from a single species (rats), without the
presence of endothelial and inflammatory cells. Based on the
Hinkel et al. study that demonstrated reduced I/R-induced cell
apoptosis and necrosis in HL-1 cells upon miR-92a inhibition in a
murine myocyte-like cell line [20], we boldly speculate that our
findings may be generalized to other species although such a
generalization clearly needs to be verified.
Taken together, the current study indicated that inhibition of
miR-92a can attenuate cardiomyocyte apoptosis induced by H/R
via the up-regulation of SMAD7 and down-regulation of nuclear
NF-kB p65.
