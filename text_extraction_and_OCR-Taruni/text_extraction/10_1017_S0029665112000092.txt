Obesity shares with most chronic diseases the presence of an inflammatory component, which
accounts for the development of metabolic disease and other associated health alterations. This
inflammatory state is reflected in increased circulating levels of pro-inflammatory proteins, and
it occurs not only in adults but also in adolescents and children. The chronic inflammatory
response has its origin in the links existing between the adipose tissue and the immune system.
Obesity, like other states of malnutrition, is known to impair the immune function, altering
leucocyte counts as well as cell-mediated immune responses. In addition, evidence has arisen
that an altered immune function contributes to the pathogenesis of obesity. This review
attempts to briefly comment on the various plausible explanations that have been proposed for
the phenomenon: (1) the obesity-associated increase in the production of leptin (pro-inflam￾matory) and the reduction in adiponectin (anti-inflammatory) seem to affect the activation of
immune cells; (2) NEFA can induce inflammation through various mechanisms (such as
modulation of adipokine production or activation of Toll-like receptors); (3) nutrient excess and
adipocyte expansion trigger endoplasmic reticulum stress; and (4) hypoxia occurring in
hypertrophied adipose tissue stimulates the expression of inflammatory genes and activates
immune cells. Interestingly, data suggest a greater impact of visceral adipose tissue and central
obesity, rather than total body fat, on the inflammatory process. In summary, there is a positive
feedback loop between local inflammation in adipose tissue and altered immune response in
obesity, both contributing to the development of related metabolic complications.
Obesity: Inflammation: Immune response: Adipose tissue: Immunonutrition
Back in February 2004, the magazine Time dedicated its
cover to inflammation and named it ‘The Secret Killer’.
The authors aimed at highlighting the importance of
inflammation in relation to the modern world’s greatest
health concerns, i.e. chronic diseases. The article echoed
scientific observations linking inflammation to pathologies,
such as Alzheimer’s disease, heart attacks or cancers(1). In
the last few years, research keeps confirming how an in￾appropriate inflammatory response – be it a result of a
disproportionate activation, an insufficient resolution, or
both – actually plays a crucial role in the onset, progression
and severity of many chronic conditions, if not all of them.
Obesity is one of the most prevalent non-communicable
diseases and a major concern for public health worldwide,
mainly due to its well-established relationship with
alterations, such as insulin resistance and diabetes,
atherosclerosis, hypertension, or some types of cancer,
among others. Obesity, like those chronic diseases men￾tioned earlier, presents an inflammatory component.
Indeed, it is now widely agreed that obesity is also a state
of low-grade chronic inflammation(2,3). This relationship
was suggested by earlier observations of higher circulating
levels of inflammatory proteins in obese individuals, but it
is currently believed that inflammation originates locally in
adipose tissue as a consequence of excessive fat deposi￾tion, and that it later reaches the systemic circulation.
Inflammatory markers in obesity
Altered circulating levels of inflammatory cytokines, such
as TNFa, IL-6, or C-reactive protein (CRP), have been

reported in overweight and obese adults(4–6) (see Table 1),
and this event has been linked to the concomitant devel￾opment of insulin resistance, metabolic disorders and
the increased cardiovascular risk seen in obesity(2). More
specifically, measures of body fat have been shown to
positively correlate with serum levels of inflammatory
proteins, and it is interesting to note that markers of
abdominal obesity (e.g. waist circumference) seem to be
more strongly associated with inflammatory markers than
the BMI or total body fat(4,5), which indicates a greater
impact of central obesity on inflammation. Furthermore,
these relationships have been described for healthy indivi￾duals as well. For instance, Hermsdorff et al. analysed
the associations between pro-inflammatory markers and
proxies for total and central fat, and observed that indices
of abdominal fat accumulation (waist circumference and
waist:hip ratio) were associated with CRP, complement
factor C3, IL-6 and retinol binding protein 4 concentra￾tions, while total body fat percentage was correlated only
with IL-6(7). Similarly, Lapice et al. showed a positive
association between CRP and abdominal fat in healthy
non-obese subjects(8). These observations are in agreement
with the more detrimental nature attributed to visceral
adipose tissue over subcutaneous adipose tissue on the
health disturbances associated with obesity(3,9), as will be
briefly discussed at the end of the review.
Is this chronic inflammation a consequence of
advancing age?
Actually, it is not. Although it is true that inflammatory
processes and inflammation-related diseases are more pre￾valent in older individuals, special attention must be paid
to the fact that these relationships do not occur only in
adults, but instead they are also being observed in adoles￾cents and children. More and more frequently, children are
being identified with obesity-associated metabolic pro￾blems, previously described only in adults(10). In the last
few years, large-scale population-based studies have
reported significant associations for CRP, a very sensitive
marker of inflammation, and proxies for body fat (i.e. BMI
and skin-fold thickness) in apparently healthy children and
adolescents(11). In overweight pediatric populations, higher
circulating levels have been found for several inflamma￾tion-related proteins, such as CRP, IL-6, or TNFa(12–18)
(Table 1). Other inflammatory markers less extensively
studied appear to be related to obesity as well. Results
from our own group following the AVENA (in Spanish,
‘Food and Nutritional Assessment in Adolescents’) study
showed associations between measures of body fat and the
complement system factors C3 and C4(19). Moreover, C3
was also shown to be associated with waist circumference,
independently of total body fat. In this same study, cer￾uloplasmin levels correlated with total body fat, although
only in girls(19). These observations were reproduced in the
most recent AFINOS (Physical Activity as a Preventive
Agent of the Development of Overweight/Obesity, Infec￾tions, Allergies and Factors of Cardiovascular Risk in
Adolescents) study, in which CRP, C3 and C4 were
again positively associated with total body fat(20). In the
European Youth Heart Study, similar results were obtained
in younger children for CRP, C3 and body fat(21).
Lifestyle-aimed interventions seem to be useful to
improve the inflammatory condition. Environmental fac￾tors, for example physical activity, may counteract the
consequences of excessive body fat. Indeed, the AFINOS
study revealed that serum levels of CRP, C3 and C4 were
not only positively associated with body fat but also
inversely associated with cardio-respiratory fitness(20). In
line with this, our group participated in the design and
implementation of an intervention programme for over￾weight and obese adolescents, with the aim to promote a
healthy lifestyle to help lose weight, the EVASYON
(Integral Education on Nutrition and Physical Activity for
Overweight/Obese Adolescents) study. This programme
resulted in decreased serum levels of leptin and other

seemed to depend on the degree of physical activity and

Obesity: an immune disease?
The interactions between nutrition and nutritional status
and the immune function have been the object of research
for some time now, and it is known that undernutrition, or
more generally, malnutrition, leads to defective immune
function and impaired immunocompetence, so that the
body is more vulnerable to illness and infections. Obesity,
which is a state of malnutrition by excess, has been related
to immune dysfunction as well, after observations of
higher rates of infections and impaired wound healing in
obese subjects(23). Excess body fat is accompanied by
changes in leucocyte counts, with elevated leucocyte,
neutrophil, monocyte and lymphocyte counts, but lower
T- and B-cell mitogen-induced proliferation(23). In addi￾tion, other studies have shown that the production of anti￾bodies after vaccination is diminished in obese
patients(23,24). Even in children evidence was obtained of
impaired cell-mediated immune responses with obesity(23).
Considering all this, it seems clear that obesity, like other
situations of malnutrition, impairs immune function.
Could it be also said that an altered immune system
underlies the onset of obesity? This affirmation would be
perhaps too speculative or not sufficiently founded at the
moment, but what does seem plausible is that, at least,
immune system dysfunction is a major contributor to the
development of obesity-associated alterations, especially to
inflammation and insulin resistance.
But how is obesity linked with the immune system?
The link seems to be adipose tissue itself. There are several
connections indeed between adipose tissue and the immune
system. For a start, macrophages and lymphocytes can be
normally found in the non-adipose fraction of the tissue(25).
Moreover, white adipocytes have been suggested to share
embryonic origin with immune cells, while characteris￾ation of adipose tissue-resident lymphocytes led to the
notion that this tissue was an ancestral immune organ(25,26).
And more recently, immature haematopoietic cells have
been found in adipose tissue, hence it has been proposed as
a site for formation and maturation of immune cell pre￾cursors(27).
In the early 2000s, histological studies in mice showed
that macrophage infiltration in adipose tissue was greater
in obese than in lean animals(28). The macrophages
appeared as crown-shaped aggregates, similar to those
observed in other known inflammatory conditions, such as
rheumatoid arthritis, and grew larger with increasing
degrees of obesity. This finding led to the idea that mac￾rophage aggregates could partially explain the obesity￾related inflammatory state(28). In support of this hypothesis,
two different phenotypes for adipose tissue-resident mac￾rophages were later described: one that acts as pro￾inflammatory (known as M1 or ‘classically activated’), and
another that acts as anti-inflammatory (M2 or ‘alternatively
activated’). Interestingly, obesity has been associated
with a switch from the M2 to the M1 phenotype; that is, to
a more pro-inflammatory profile(29). Furthermore, the
absence of the M2 phenotype has been associated with a
higher susceptibility to obesity, inflammation and insulin
resistance(30).
The enhanced macrophage infiltration in the obese adi￾pose tissue explains in part, but not completely, the
increased production of cytokines and chemokines. These
molecules are mainly produced by immune cells, e.g.
monocytes, macrophages and T-lymphocytes, and also by
other cells such as mast cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells,
neurons, or adipocytes themselves. Fat cells secrete, among
others, TNFa, IL-6, monocyte chemotactic protein 1,
transforming growth factor b, or acute phase proteins(31).
Consequently, alteration of adipocyte function plays a
crucial role in the development of obesity-associated
inflammation.
Why does an inflammatory response initiate in the
adipose tissue?
This is still a complicated question to address. Cytokines
are chemical messengers that are released to regulate gene
expression in a specific organ or cell type, and which
interact in a complex way, mutually inducing or inhibiting
their production and effects. What is the purpose or use￾fulness of the enhanced cytokine production in obesity?
We can only speculate in this respect so far, but the
answers can be searched in the enlarged, lipid-loaded adi￾pocyte. In a situation of excessive nutrient inflow and sto￾rage, there must be mechanisms operating within and from
the cell in order to maintain or restore energy homo￾eostasis. Certain cytokines, e.g. IL-6 and TNFa, are known
to induce insulin resistance(2,3), so their local production
could constitute a regulatory mechanism to stop the
hypertrophied adipocyte from storing lipids. Or, macro￾phage infiltration in response to adipocyte-derived chemo￾kines, such as monocyte chemotactic protein 1 or
macrophage migration inhibitory factor, may respond to
the need for clearing the adipose tissue of dysfunctional
and necrotic fat cells, such as phagocytes normally do, for
instance, during an acute inflammatory response in the
context of an infection. The problem arises when, as a
result of sustained obesity, the inflammatory response does
not achieve its goal and it is not resolved, thus turning
from a local reaction to a systemic chronic state.
How does this response start? What is the trigger
for the initial inflammatory signal?
The mechanisms linking obesity and chronic low-grade
systemic inflammation are yet not entirely understood, but
different plausible explanations have been proposed. They
will be now commented on briefly in an attempt to offer a
clear and likely picture of the situation. It is important,
however, to keep in mind that these processes are not
mutually exclusive, but instead they might all operate in an
orchestrated synergistic fashion (see Fig. 1).

The mechanisms for adipose tissue inflammation: all
roads lead to Rome
Adipokines modulate the production and release
of inflammatory cytokines
Adipose tissue in general and adipocytes in particular
secrete a great number of bioactive molecules of different
nature, collectively termed adipokines, many of which
have immuno-modulatory actions(31). This is the case for
leptin and adiponectin, to mention only the two most
paradigmatic adipokines.
Leptin, the first adipokine to be discovered, regulates
immune function on various levels: stimulating monocyte
proliferation and differentiation into macrophages, mod￾ulating the activation of natural killer lymphocytes, or
inducing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines
such as TNFa, IL-6, or IL-12(23,32). In animal models, the
absence of leptin or leptin action has been associated with
defective immune function. For instance, ob/ob mice,
which are leptin-deficient, present lymphoid organ atrophy,
reduced thymus proportion, lower lymphocyte and natural
killer cell numbers, decreased cytotoxic activity and lower
expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. These mice as
well as the db/db mice (which lack leptin receptors) are
less efficient in fighting infections. Zucker rats, which
are also leptin receptor-deficient, show lymphopenia and
a lower phagocytic capacity(23). Leptin is a sensor of
the state of energy stores in the body, and when these
stores enlarge, leptin acts on the central nervous system
stimulating satiety and energy expenditure. Therefore,
circulating leptin levels increase in parallel with body fat
mass. However, it is well known that, in most cases,
human obesity is accompanied by a blunt central response
to leptin action, and this leads to a situation of leptin
resistance and compensatory hyperleptinaemia, with pos￾sible consequences on the activation of immune cells.
Adiponectin, an anti-inflammatory and insulin-sensitizing
hormone, exerts opposite immune-modulatory actions to
leptin. It inhibits the phagocytic activity and the production
of TNFa in macrophages, the differentiation of monocyte
precursors, the synthesis of endothelial adhesion molecules
and the formation of foam cells(33). In addition, it stimulates
the release of anti-inflammatory IL, such as IL-10 or IL-1
receptor agonist(32). And it is known that, unlike those of
leptin, adiponectin concentrations correlate inversely with
body weight.
Therefore, changes in the levels of the two main adipo￾kines may contribute to the onset and maintenance of the
systemic inflammation along with insulin resistance pre￾sent in obesity.
Fatty acids can induce inflammation
Abnormally elevated blood lipid levels, including NEFA,
are a common feature in obesity. There are different
explanations for this increase; one is known as the ‘adipose
tissue expandability’ hypothesis(34). According to this
hypothesis, the adipose tissue as a whole has limited
capacity to expand and to store energy. Exceeding this
limit leads to enhanced lipolysis within the adipocyte and
the subsequent release of NEFA into the blood stream.
NEFA reach other tissues and organs, and exert toxic
effects on them, e.g. resistance to insulin action; a phe￾nomenon known as lipotoxicity.
The chemical nature of fatty acids is relevant to
triggering the inflammatory response. Studies on weight￾discordant twins have shown that obese individuals exhib￾ited signs of insulin resistance and stimulated inflammatory
and immune response pathways in adipose tissue when
compared to their lean twins. These alterations paralleled
considerable differences in adipose tissue fatty acid com￾position, which resulted in diminished proportions of
stearic (18:0), linoleic (18:2n-6) and a-linolenic (18:
3n-3) acids, and elevated levels of palmitoleic (16:1n-7)
and arachidonic (20:4n-6) acids in obese twins(35). SFA
appear to be especially important in this regard, as they
may stimulate TNFa and IL-6 production in adipocytes(36).
In addition, there seems to be a positive feedback loop
involving SFA from adipocytes and cytokines from mac￾rophages: SFA can increase the production of TNFa in
macrophages, and in turn the immune cells induce lipolysis
in adipocytes (Fig. 1). These events accelerate the inflam￾matory change in the adipose tissue in obesity(37).
How can fatty acids elicit an inflammatory response? In
the first place, they have been suggested to modulate adi￾pokine production and/or secretion. As an example, adi￾ponectin levels have been associated with fatty acids, this
correlation being negative with SFA, palmitoleic (16:1n-7)
or g-linolenic (18:3n-6) fatty acids and positive with oleic
acid and total n-6 and n-3 PUFA(38,39).

Alternatively, NEFA may directly induce inflammatory
pathways through activation of cell receptors. For instance,
they are natural ligands for the PPAR. These transcription
factors regulate cell metabolism and adipocyte differenti￾ation, and can also suppress the activity of the NF-kB,
another transcription factor crucial in the initiation of the
inflammatory response. In addition, PPAR seem to be
involved in the aforementioned phenotypic switch of adi￾pose tissue macrophages (from M2 or anti-inflammatory to
M1 or pro-inflammatory)(40). On the other hand, recent
evidence has suggested that fatty acids, especially SFA,
may also act through binding to Toll-like receptors, the
activation of which induces the synthesis of inflammatory
markers in macrophages and aggravates insulin resis￾tance(41) (Fig. 1).
In turn, pro-inflammatory cytokines increase NEFA
levels(42), and chronic systemic inflammation stimulates
lipolysis and decreases lipogenesis in adipose tissue, while
having the opposite effects on lipid synthesis in skeletal
muscle and liver(43), and in consequence the situation is
aggravated.
Too many nutrients mean cellular stress
The excessive adipose tissue growth has further con￾sequences at the cellular and subcellular levels, and a role
has been suggested for endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress
in the origin of adipocyte dysfunction in obesity(44).
Briefly, the ER is a primary site for protein synthesis and
TAG droplet formation. Under conditions of cellular stress
of various natures, ER function becomes progressively
impaired and this triggers a security mechanism known as
the ‘unfolded protein response’ (UPR). The UPR is linked
to: (1) the production of reactive oxygen species, and
therefore greater oxidative stress and (2) the activation
of inflammatory pathways, with increased expression of
cytokines, such as IL-8, IL-6, monocyte chemotactic pro￾tein 1 and TNFa.
The state of nutrient excess and cell expansion in obesity
implies a higher demand for protein and TAG droplet for￾mation, and this may as well induce ER stress and the
UPR. Additionally, nutrients themselves may serve as sig￾nals leading to ER stress. For example, and in relation to
the previous section, NEFA have been shown to induce the
UPR in various cell types. Paradoxically, glucose depri￾vation might also contribute to ER stress in obesity; this
could happen as a result of insulin resistance eventually
developing within the adipose tissue.
Finally, and closing a positive feed-back loop, the
inflammatory condition in the obese adipose tissue induces
the UPR and enhances ER stress(44).
The obese adipocyte needs oxygen
We have already commented on how the obese adipocyte
receives a greater nutrient supply that it transforms into
TAG droplets, becoming larger and larger. The capacity of
adipose tissue to change its size surpasses that of other
organs and tissues. In consequence, adipose tissue expan￾sion in obesity eventually reaches a point where the
development of local vasculature is insufficient, and cannot
meet the oxygen demands of distant enlarged adipocytes. It
was hypothesized that hypoxic adipocytes would then
produce inflammatory signals in order to stimulate angio￾genesis(31), and later studies in animal and culture models
have confirmed this hypothesis(45). The key element in the
initiation of the cellular response to hypoxia is the
hypoxia-inducible factor 1, a transcription factor highly
unstable under normoxic conditions, but which becomes
stabilized when oxygen availability is low. Once stabilized,
hypoxia-inducible factor 1 regulates the expression of a
great number of genes involved in different functions that
include angiogenesis, inflammation and energy metabo￾lism. Some of these genes are leptin, plasminogen activator
inhibitor 1 or macrophage migration inhibitory factor, all
of which become up-regulated, and adiponectin, which
becomes down-regulated(45).
Hypoxia has important consequences for adipocyte
metabolism, as it forces the cell to switch from aerobic to
anaerobic glycolysis, in order to obtain energy from glu￾cose. This results in increased production and release of
lactate from adipocytes(46). Lactate has been shown to sti￾mulate inflammatory pathways in macrophages(47) and it
also appears to enhance the lipopolysaccharide-induced
inflammatory response in pre-adipocytes(48).
However, adipocytes are not the only cells responsive to
hypoxia within adipose tissue. Resident macrophages tend
to accumulate around hypoxic areas, probably recruited by
chemotactic signals released from affected adipocytes, and
they respond to the lack of oxygen in a similar manner to
adipocytes, by producing pro-inflammatory cytokines. Pre￾adipocytes are also sensitive to hypoxia, although their
response is milder than that of mature adipocytes(45).
It is apparent that the hypoxia response fails to achieve
the expected effect of increasing adipose tissue vascular￾ization, but instead it leads to a situation of local fibrosis,
which contributes to adipose tissue dysfunction(49). In line
with this, hypoxia has been found to induce the UPR
(see earlier) in cultured adipocytes(44).
Visceral fat v. total fat: what difference does it make?
As mentioned earlier in this review, most characteristics of
adipose tissue vary according to its anatomical localisation,
and these differences render the visceral fat more clinically
relevant than the subcutaneous fat, with regard to the
development of metabolic disturbances, insulin resistance
or cardiovascular risk(3,9). As far as inflammation is con￾cerned, there are several features that suggest that visceral
fat accumulation is again more detrimental than sub￾cutaneous fat. Firstly, infiltration of macrophages in obe￾sity seems to be greater in visceral than in subcutaneous
adipose tissue(50). On the contrary, the gene expression of
the anti-inflammatory adipokine adiponectin was found to
be lower in the visceral than in the subcutaneous depot(51).
More recently, it has been observed in obese subjects that
endothelial cells isolated from visceral fat show a higher
expression of genes related to angiogenesis and inflamma￾tion than endothelial cells from subcutaneous adipose
tissue(52). In addition, the expression of hypoxia-related
genes also seems to be greater in the visceral adipose
tissue, although vascularisation is not poorer there when

compared with the subcutaneous depot. And finally, the
cells from visceral fat show more evident signs of cellular
senescence than those from subcutaneous fat(52).
Conclusions
In summary, inflammation and an altered immune response
are important components of obesity and contribute greatly
to the development of related metabolic complications,
especially of insulin resistance. The explanation lies in the
close interrelationship between the adipose tissue and the
immune system. As a matter of fact, obesity-associated
chronic systemic inflammation has its origin in a dysfunc￾tion of the adipose tissue. Various plausible explanations
have been proposed for the phenomenon, such as changes
in adipokine secretion, fatty acid-induced inflammation,
oxidative stress, ER stress, or adipose tissue hypoxia, and
they are likely to act in a synergistic manner. However,
more research is still needed to understand the precise
mechanisms for adipose tissue inflammatory response and
how it leads to metabolic alterations.
