INTRODUCTION
A lymphocele is a lymphatic collection around the renal graft 
and urinary bladder. It can arise from either the lymph that 
drains through the lymphatic vessels in the sinus of the transplanted 
kidney or the lymphatic vessels surrounding the iliac vessels of 
the recipient.(1,2) The reported incidence of lymphoceles ranges 
widely, from 1%–2% to as high as 20%.(1,2) Factors associated with 
the aetiology of lymphoceles include acute rejection, length of 
surgery, extent of dissection and use of immunosuppressants.(1,2)
Small lymphoceles might be asymptomatic, but large ones 
can cause compression of the pelvicalyceal system, resulting 
in hydronephrosis and worsening renal function.(3) The most 
common symptoms of lymphoceles are abdominal pain, lower 
limb oedema and urinary retention in the transplanted kidney, 
resulting in impaired graft function. Ultrasonography is 
the most common diagnostic tool used in the visualisation 
of lymphoceles. The aim of this study was to review the 
epidemiology, presentation, treatment and outcome of patients 
who underwent renal transplantation at our institute and 
subsequently developed lymphoceles.
METHODS
Between January 2005 and November 2008, 154 renal 
transplantations were performed at the Singapore General 
Hospital, Singapore. Although these procedures were performed 
by various surgeons at our institution, the surgical techniques 
used were the same. The renal graft was placed in the iliac fossa, 
vessels were anastomosed to the iliac vessels and the ureter 
was implanted into the bladder. All lymphatic channels of the 
recipient’s iliac arteries and veins encountered during dissection 
were ligated with small titanium clips or diathermised, 
depending on the individual surgeon’s preference. A double J 
stent was routinely inserted in the implanted ureter. A surgical 
drain was also inserted.
Baseline ultrasonography of the transplanted kidney was 
performed postoperatively and repeated whenever indicated. 
Patients with lymphoceles were managed conservatively if they 
were asymptomatic. However, intervention was considered 
necessary if the patient presented with hydronephrosis and 
worsening renal function. Intervention included percutaneous 
drainage of the collection, surgical drainage via laparoscopy, or 
open drainage. Percutaneous drainage was routinely performed 
under ultrasonographic guidance by an interventional radiologist. 
The lymphatic collection was aspirated until dry, and no 
sclerosant injections were used for any of the patients. In patients 
who underwent laparoscopic drainage, the omentum was 
inserted into the peritoneal window to prevent closure, whereas 
this was not necessary in those who underwent open surgical 
drainage, as the peritoneal window was large. The fluid aspirated 
from the collection was routinely sent for measurement of 
creatinine level to exclude the possibility of urinoma.

INTRODUCTION The incidence of lymphoceles – lymphatic collections around a transplanted kidney – can be as high as 
20%. We aimed to review the presentation, treatment and outcome of patients with lymphoceles.
METHODS We reviewed a prospective database of 154 patients who underwent renal transplantation at our hospital 
from January 2005 to November 2008.
RESULTS The mean age of the patients in our cohort was 46 (range 34–58) years. The incidence of lymphoceles in our 
series was 5.8% (n = 9). The median onset was 19 (range 6–28) days post-transplantation, while the median size of the 
lymphoceles was 5 (range 1.5–8) cm. Lymphoceles were most commonly found at the lower pole of the transplanted 
kidney. Eight patients with lymphoceles had received cadaveric transplants. While a majority of these patients did not 
have hydronephrosis on presentation, four had markedly elevated creatinine. Of the nine patients with lymphoceles, six 
were on macrolides (tacrolimus, sirolimus or everolimus), two were successfully managed conservatively, three were 
managed percutaneously and four required surgical drainage via either laparoscopic marsupialisation (n = 1) or open 
drainage (n = 3). There was no graft loss.
CONCLUSION It remains unknown whether the choice of immunosuppressants increases the risk of lymphocele 
formation. Intervention is necessary in the case of impaired drainage of the pelvicalyceal system in these patients. 
Minimally invasive intervention, while effective in treating lymphoceles, does not provide definitive treatment. Surgical 
intervention should be considered early for the treatment of post-transplantation patients with lymphoceles, so as to 
shorten hospital stay and prevent further complications.

RESULTS
Out of the 154 patients who underwent renal transplantations, 
lymphoceles occurred in 9 (5.8%) patients. The median onset of 
occurrence was 19 (range 6–28) days after surgery. The median 
age of patients diagnosed with lymphocele was 46 (range 34–58) 
years. The median operative time was 180 mins. The median 
maximum diameter of the lymphoceles was 5 (range 1.5–8.0) cm. 
Diagnosis of lymphocele was made by ultrasonography, and 
no aspiration of the lymphocele was performed in the patients. 
The site of occurrence of lymphoceles included the inferior 
(n = 5), lateral (n = 2), upper (n = 1) and medial (n = 1) poles 
of the transplanted kidneys. Eight out of the nine patients 
(88.9%) diagnosed with lymphocele had received cadaveric 
transplants, while 1 (11.1%) patient received a living transplant 
from a relative. Out of these nine patients, 7 (77.8%) had no 
hydronephrosis at presentation. Postoperatively, 2 (22.2%) 
patients developed clinically significant hydronephrosis, 4 
(44.4%) had clinically elevated creatinine levels (Table I), and 6 
(66.7%) were on macrolides such as tacrolimus, sirolimus and 
everolimus. Although there were no delayed graft functions, 
there was one case of acute graft rejection.
Of the nine patients with lymphoceles, five were initially 
treated conservatively (Fig. 1). Among these five patients, 
three required subsequent intervention in the form of either 
percutaneous drainage or surgical intervention – two were 
managed successfully using percutaneous drainage, and one 
required repeated percutaneous drainage. The four patients 
who did not receive conservative treatment initially were treated 
with percutaneous drainage from the onset; however, due to 
failure of percutaneous drainage, two of these four patients 
had to undergo surgical treatment. In all, four patients were 
surgically treated because of failed percutaneous drainage, with 
drainage via the open method performed in three patients and 
laparoscopic drainage in one patient. Fluid culture was positive for 
Klebsiella spp. in only one out of seven patients who required 
intervention. Among the three patients who eventually 
underwent open drainage, two each had a sizeable lymphocele 
measuring > 4 cm, and one had significant hydronephrosis and 
positive culture. In patients for whom conservative treatment 
failed, indications for intervention were an enlarging lymphocele 
size leading to worsening of renal function. There was no graft 
loss in any of the nine patients with lymphoceles. There was also 
no recurrence documented among any of the patients during the 
follow-up period (median 40 [range 38–84] months).
DISCUSSION
The reported incidence of symptomatic lymphoceles in the 
literature is 0.6%–18.0%.(1) The incidence of lymphoceles in our 
study was 5.8% (n = 9), which is comparable to that reported 
in the literature. Although lymphoceles can be harmless and 
asymptomatic in many patients, they can also seriously affect 
renal function and may necessitate surgical intervention. 
Although asymptomatic lymphoceles do not require therapy, it 
is important that regular ultrasonographic monitoring continues 
until the collection is resolved. In the case of a large or 
symptomatic collection, therapy aims to efficiently and 
completely remove the collection. However, there is no gold 
standard of treatment for lymphoceles.
Percutaneous aspiration of the collection is associated with 
a high incidence (50%–100%) of recurrence.(2) Some authors 
have recommended laparoscopic marsupialisation as the first￾line treatment of lymphoceles,(2,3) while others have suggested 
initial percutaneous aspiration under ultrasonographic guidance, 
followed by sclerotherapy to prevent reaccumulation of 
fluid.(4-6) Percutaneous aspiration of lymphoceles has been shown

to reduce the risk of recurrence (range 13%–33%),(7-9) as has 
additional sclerotherapy (range 6%–25%).(2,4,7) Common sclerosing 
agents used in sclerotherapy are doxycycline and ethanol.(5)
Other sclerosing agents include povidone-iodine, talc and 
bleomycin. The use of sclerosing agents is generally considered 
safe and highly successful, although some reports have suggested 
that they have toxic effects on graft functions and may even cause 
graft loss.(10,11) Surgical interventions for lymphoceles include 
marsupialisation, or external drainage via open or laparoscopic 
technique. The recurrence rates of lymphoceles following 
laparoscopic marsupialisation (range 6%–12%)(2,7) and open 
drainage (range 6.7%–13%)(3,7) are comparable. Laparoscopic 
marsupialisation is the recommended surgical intervention for 
lymphoceles, as it is less invasive, and has shorter operative 
time and hospital stay, as well as better cosmesis.
In our study, conservative and less invasive treatment, such 
as percutaneous drainage, was successful in 55.5% of patients. 
Among the four patients who had surgical intervention, one 
underwent laparoscopic marsupialisation and three underwent 
open drainage. Consistent with the results from other centres,(12)
three of these patients had larger sized lymphoceles (> 6 cm in 
diameter). We opted to perform open drainage in three patients 
under surgical intervention, as two of them had a history of 
previous abdominal surgery and one patient’s collection was 
close to the hilum. There was no recurrence of lymphocele in any 
of our patients, regardless of the kind of treatment (percutaneous 
or surgical) used.
Although the surgical management of lymphoceles has 
remained largely unchanged, it remains unclear whether the 
introduction of newer immunosuppressants, such as tacrolimus, 
sirolimus and everolimus, has contributed to the increasing 
numbers of patients developing lymphoceles after renal 
transplantation. While studies have shown that sirolimus is a 
powerful immunosuppressant for renal transplant recipients,(13,14)
its use has been associated with a higher frequency of lymphocele 
formation.(13) According to Srivastava et al, the incidence of 
lymphocele in patients treated with sirolimus is slightly higher 
than in those receiving mycophenolate mofetil.(15) Even though 
the exact reasons for the development of lymphocele are still 
uncertain, avoiding the use of sirolimus in renal transplant 
recipients at the early postoperative period may help to reduce 
the incidence of lymphocele in these patients. Based on the results 
obtained from our local setting, we have developed an algorithm 
for the management of post-transplantation lymphoceles (Fig. 2).
The initial decision on whether a post-transplantation 
patient with lymphocele should be treated conservatively would 
depend on factors such as the size of the lymphocele, the 
symptoms observed, as well as the presence of hydronephrosis, 
impaired renal function or concomitant infection. If treatment is 
warranted, percutaneous drainage should be offered to patients. 
However, for patients with a collection > 6 cm in diameter, 
surgical options should be considered. In the event of a failed 
percutaneous intervention, surgical drainage should be offered 
to the patient. Laparoscopic drainage may also be offered, unless 
contraindicated due to small volume (< 100 mL) of fluid, previous 
abdominal surgery, suspicion of infection, as well as location of 
lymphocele near the bladder, ureter or renal hilum.
In summary, the incidence of lymphocele was 5.8% in 
our series. Even though surgical techniques have remained 
unchanged for the most part, it is still unclear whether the 
introduction of newer immunosuppressants has contributed to 
the higher incidence of lymphoceles in post-renal transplantation 
patients. Intervention is required if the lymphocele causes an 
impairment in the drainage of the pelvicalyceal system. We found 
that although minimally invasive intervention was effective in 
treating lymphoceles, it did not provide a definitive treatment. 
Percutaneous drainage was found to be consistently associated 
with a higher recurrence rate, prolonged hospital stay, higher 
costs and more complications. Surgical intervention should be 
considered earlier in the treatment of patients with post￾transplantation lymphoceles so as to shorten hospital stay and 
prevent further complications.
