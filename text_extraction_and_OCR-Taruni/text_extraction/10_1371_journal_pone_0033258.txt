Abstract
Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) caused by ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) during renal transplantation delays allograft function.
Identification of factors that mediate protection and/or epithelium recovery could help to improve graft outcome. We
studied the expression, regulation and role of hypoxia inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1 a), using in vitro and in vivo
experimental models of I/R as well as human post-transplant renal biopsies. We found that HIF-1 a is stabilized in proximal
tubule cells during ischemia and unexpectedly in late reperfusion, when oxygen tension is normal. Both inductions lead to
gene expression in vitro and in vivo. In vitro interference of HIF-1 a promoted cell death and in vivo interference exacerbated
tissue damage and renal dysfunction. In pos-transplant human biopsies, HIF-1 a was expressed only in proximal tubules
which exhibited normal renal structure with a significant negative correlation with ATN grade. In summary, using
experimental models and human biopsies, we identified a novel HIF-1 a induction during reperfusion with a potential
critical role in renal transplant.

Introduction
Ischemia is one of the most frequent causes of acute renal failure
[1], chronic kidney disease and also occurs during kidney
transplantation. Indeed, development of ATN significantly
contributes to renal allograft function delay [2]. In spite of the
advances in the immunosuppressive therapy, there is little
improvement in ATN recovery during renal transplant.
HIF-1 a is the master regulator of cell response to hypoxia since
it leads to the expression of several genes involved in adaptation to
decreased oxygen availability [3]. HIF is a heterodimeric protein
including an oxygen-regulated alpha subunit and a constitutive
expressed beta subunit. Alpha subunits are degraded during
normoxia mainly through a proteasome-dependent pathway after
hydroxylation of two proline residues by prolyl-hydroxilases
(PHDs). During hypoxia, PHDs are inhibited and HIF-1 a
subunit accumulates, dimerizes with HIF-1b and drive expression
of HIF target genes which include genes involved in angiogenesis
and tissue repair such as vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF) or erythropoietin (EPO) and prolilhydroxilases (PHDs)
genes, among others.
Knowledge about mechanisms involved in normoxic HIF-1 a
induction is just beginning to emerge. It has been shown that HIF￾1 a can be up-regulated through the PI3k/Akt-mTOR pathway in
response to growth factors [4,5]. Impairment in HIF-1 a
degradation can also contribute to the induction of this factor in
normoxia [6]. Evidence regarding the critical role of HIF-1 a in
the cell response to stimuli independently of oxygen restriction is
increasing [7].
A reno-protective role of HIF against ischemic injury in I/R
models [8] and toxic nephropathies has been already described
[9]. Moreover, the use of PHDs inhibitors such as iron-chelators in
renal transplant models indicates that HIF induction protects
tubular cells from ischemic injury [10]. These investigations prove

the beneficial role of HIF-1 a stabilization before or during
ischemia. However, data describing non-oxygen regulated HIF-1
a expression during reperfusion after ischemia and its potential
implications in renal injury outcome are scarce.
In this work, using an in vitro model of oxygen and nutrient
alterations in the human proximal epithelial cell line HK-2 [12],
an in vivo model of I/R [11] in rats and a set of human allograft
biopsies exhibiting ATN, we have studied the expression,
regulation and the potential role of HIF-1 a in the tubular
response during I/R. Our results identify HIF-1 a accumulated
during reperfusion as a putative target for intervention to
accelerate ATN recovery after renal transplants.
Results
HIF-1 a is bi-phasically induced during hypoxia/
reoxygenation in proximal tubule cells
We had established and characterized in our laboratory an in
vitro model of oxygen and nutrient deprivation/replenishment [11]
in the human proximal epithelial cells HK-2 called hypoxia/
reoxygenation (H/R) (figure 1A), which closely reproduce the
stimuli and the effects of renal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) in
proximal epithelial tubule cells. Using this model, we determined
HIF-1 a expression by inmunoblot (figure 1B). HIF-1 a has a
biphasic pattern of induction: after hypoxia and during reox￾ygenation (1–3 h).
To assess whether these HIF-1 a inductions are the result of
protein stabilization, qRT-PCR to estimate HIF-1 a mRNA levels
was performed. No significant changes in HIF-1 a mRNA were
observed (fig. 1C), indicating that in our model, HIF-1 a is
regulated mainly at protein level.
These results indicate that HIF-1 a is accumulated during
hypoxia but unexpectedly also during reperfusion.
Akt/mTOR signalling is responsible for HIF-1 a
accumulation during reoxygenation
Although Akt/mTOR signalling pathway is not required for
hypoxia-induced HIF-1 a [13,14], activation of Akt/mTOR
pathway has been proposed as one of the mechanisms responsible
for HIF-1 a stabilization in normoxia.
Therefore, we determined pAkt (Ser437) levels, by immunoblot,
finding that Akt is not activated during hypoxia but is transiently
activated during reoxygenation (15 min-3 h), when HIF-1 a
induction is observed (figure 1D). Moreover, the use of PI3K
specific inhibitor LY 294002 during reoxygenation efficiently
reduced HIF-1 a expression (figure 1E), indicating that Akt
activation is responsible for HIF-1 a stabilization during this
period. Conversely, the use of LY did not affect HIF-1 a induction
during hypoxia. LY294002 exhibited high efficiency inhibiting Akt
phosphorylation (figure 1F).
Additionally, the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin was used during
reoxygenation to assess mTOR implication in HIF-1 a induction
(figure 1G). Inhibition of mTOR prevents HIF-1 a stabilization.
These findings demonstrate that the Akt/mTOR signalling
pathway activation is responsible for HIF-1 a induction during
reoxygenation, among others.
To determine whether HIF-1 a could accumulate indepen￾dently of low oxygen levels, we set up a new protocol including
changes in nutrients but not in oxygen tension, called depletion/
replenishment (D/R) (figure 2A). This protocol leads exclusively to
the second HIF-1 a induction although it accumulates earlier
(figure 2B). Importantly Akt is also activated during D/R protocol
(figure 2C). Both results demonstrate that HIF-1 a induction
during reoxygenation is not due to low oxygen tension, but rather
involves Akt activation.
Both HIF-1 a inductions promote gene expression
To study whether HIF-1 a accumulations resulted in an
increased activity of this factor we evaluated HIF-1 a -dependent
gene expression in HK2 cells during H/R.
We first determined the transcriptional activity of both HIF-1 a
inductions by performing luciferase assays in transiently transfect￾ed HK-2 cells with the 9xHRE-luc reporter [15] (figure 3A). Both
HIF-1 a inductions increase luciferase activity compared to
control cells, indicating that both HIF-1 a inductions promote
gene expression. D/R protocol also induced 9xHRE-luc activity,
demonstrating that the normoxic HIF-1 a induction by itself
promotes gene expression.
Next, we estimated the expression of HIF-1 a target genes such
as EPO, VEGF and PHD3, by qRT-PCR (figure 3B). PHD3 and
VEGF were markedly induced during hypoxia and both mRNAs
remained elevated during reoxygenation. In contrast, EPO
mRNA was expressed mainly during reoxygenation, when the
second HIF-1 a induction was taking place. Interestingly and
correlating with the luciferase assay results, EPO, VEGF and
PHD3 mRNA were also up-regulated during D/R protocol,
demonstrating that the normoxic HIF-1 a stabilization also led to
gene expression.
HIF-1 a is induced after ischemia and during reperfusion
in vivo
To study HIF-1 a in vivo, we have characterized the expression
pattern and activity of HIF-1 a in a model of I/R in Sprague
Dawley (SD) rats. We have also assessed the oxygen availability
during I/R in renal tissue using pimonidazole.
Immunohistochemistry in renal tissue demonstrated HIF-1 a
expression in the nucleus of proximal tubule cells after ischemia,
and, unexpectedly during reperfusion, between days 3 and 7
(figure 4A). As expected, pimonidazole staining revealed tissue
hypoxia after ischemia, but it was negative at 5 days of reperfusion,
indicating that tissue oxygen levels are not compromised at this
moment even though HIF-1 a accumulates (figure 4B).
To determine the functionality of both HIF-1 a inductions in
vivo, we measured the mRNA of HIF-1 a target genes including
PHD3, VEGF and EPO (figure 5). All these genes are induced
after ischemia and also during reperfusion. Notably, EPO mRNA
is the most up-regulated during reperfusion.
These results demonstrated that HIF-1 a accumulates in vivo
during reperfusion after renal ischemia and promotes gene
expression, correlating with in vitro findings. The HIF-1 a
induction observed during reperfusion is not due to low oxygen
levels in the renal parenchyma.
HIF-1 a mediates proximal tubule cells survival and
recovery in response to I/R in vitro and in vivo
Next, we investigated the biological significance of both HIF-1 a
inductions using, in vitro, siRNAs for HIF-1 a and YC-1, a
pharmacological inhibitor of HIF-1 a. By PI staining and flow
cytometry, H/R and D/R protocol did not induce cell death. The
use of HIF-1 Æ siRNA (figure 6A) or YC-1 (figure 6B) in both
protocols provoked significant cell death at 24 h.
Both approaches efficiently reduced HIF-1 a levels in our model
(Figure 6C, 6D, 6E). YC-1 was used because siRNA does not
prevent each HIF-1 a inductions separately. Notably, neither
siRNA for HIF-1 a nor YC-1 affected Akt activation during
reperfusion (Figure 6F).

HIF-1a Promotes Tubule Repair after I/R
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 March 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 3 | e33258

These results demonstrated that HIF-1 a promotes proximal
tubule epithelial cell survival during I/R-mimicking conditions.
Outstandingly, HIF-1 a induction during reoxygenation is also
critical for avoiding cell death.
Next, the I/R model was used to elucidate the role of HIF-1 a
during I/R in vivo by means of HIF-1 a interference. The protocol
and interference efficiency in vivo are shown by measuring HIF-1 a
mRNA levels in total renal lysates in figure 7. HIF-1 a interference
in rats and analysis of renal histology by PAS staining and renal
function by urea and creatinine levels in serum are shown in
figure 8A and 8B.
HIF-1 a interference during reperfusion dramatically increases
proximal tubule damage after 3 to 5 days, compared to scramble.
Tubular alterations, mainly dilation and epithelial denudation are
more evident in the interfered animals. Accordingly, renal function
is worsened in interfered animals at 3 days of reperfusion.
However, renal function is almost similar between scramble and
interfered conditions later during reperfusion (5 days), correlating
with the well known dichotomy between recovery of renal
structure and creatinine/urea levels in this model.
These results demonstrate that HIF-1 a induction during
reperfusion is an essential requirement for proximal tubule cell
survival and consequently earlier recovery after renal ischemia.
HIF-1 a expression in proximal tubules of human renal
allograft correlates with less extended ATN
Our data from the experimental in vitro and in vivo models
strongly suggested that HIF-1 a has a protective role against
ischemic injury. Therefore we have used post-transplant human
biopsies were ischemic damage is observed to confirm this
observation.
Thus, we have assessed HIF-1 a expression in a set of 15 human
renal biopsies with different ischemic ATN severity, obtained
mostly between days 7 to 15 after transplantation. The
characteristics of the biopsies are presented in table 1.
Representative images of PAS staining and HIF-1 a immuno￾staining are presented in figure 9A. Biopsies number 6 and 14
exhibited extensive ATN development with marked alterations in
proximal tubules: loss of microvilli, loss of epithelium integrity and
tubule denudation. Both expressed HIF-1 a. Biopsy number 4
exhibits less ATN with normal epithelium structure and
morphology, presence of microvilli and proximal cell proliferation
(for repair of denudated tubules). Interestingly, this biopsy showed
strong HIF-1 a expression. ATN development vs recovery
estimation following histopathological criteria as well as quantifi￾cation of HIF-1 a expression in the biopsies is shown in table 2.
Additionally, significant negative correlation by Rho Spearman
analysis was found between HIF expression and ATN severity
(figure 9B).
All these findings demonstrate that HIF-1 a is expressed during
the post-transplant period in proximal tubules which exhibit minor
ATN and recovered morphology, strongly suggesting that HIF-1 a
stabilized during reperfusion is required for proximal tubule
survival and repair after ischemic damage.
Discussion
We demonstrate that HIF-1 a is accumulated after renal
ischemia and unexpectedly, also in reperfusion. This induction is
observed in human proximal tubule cells after H/R, in rat kidneys
after I/R and in human biopsies post-transplant. HIF-1 a
induction during reperfusion is crucial for proximal tubule
epithelial cell survival and recovery after I/R as the interference
approaches in vitro and in vivo demonstrated. Indeed, HIF-1 a
drives target genes expression, including genes involved in tissue
repair such as EPO or VEGF. Our data in human biopsies
strongly suggested that HIF-1 a is essential in ATN recovery and
might play a critical role in allograft outcome. In vivo and in vitro
approaches demonstrated that this HIF-1 a accumulation is not
related to low oxygen tension, but rather to Akt/mTOR pathway
activation.
HIF-1 a induction during renal ischemia has been extensively
studied [16]. However, HIF-1 a induction during in vivo
reperfusion has not been previously described although stabiliza￾tion of this factor during reoxygenation in endothelial cells has
been reported [17]. In humans, HIF-1 a expression in renal
allograft several weeks after transplantation was suggested to be
probably related to a chronic hypoxia caused by hyperfiltration,
hyperthrophy, calcineurin inhibitor-induced toxicity or combina￾tion of them [18]. Our results using pimonidazole in rats strongly
support that HIF-1 a induction during reperfusion is not the
consequence of low oxygen tension in the renal parenchyma.
Accordingly, using an in vitro model which mimics the proximal
tubule damage and repair induced by I/R in vivo [12] we
demonstrate that HIF-1 a is induced also during the reoxygena￾Figure 2. In vitro, HIF-1 a induction during reoxygenation is not due to low oxygen levels. (a) Scheme of in vitro protocol of Depletion/

tion period. Moreover, an in vitro protocol of depletion/
replenishment of nutrients, where oxygen tension is not modified,
also reproduced the second HIF-1 a induction, confirming that
HIF-1 a is also induced during reperfusion/reoxygenation in an
O2-independent manner.
HIF-1 a protein is significantly accumulated during reperfusion
as the result of protein synthesis, since mRNA levels did not
change significantly. HIF-1 a can be detected in normoxia in
response to growth factors, hormones or cytokines [19]. Activation
of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signalling pathways leading to increase in
protein translation has been described as the main mechanism of
normoxic-HIF-1 a accumulation [5]. Our findings demonstrate
that Akt is activated early during reoxygenation followed by HIF-1
a induction. Moreover, LY 292004 and rapamycin prevents HIF￾1 a induction during reoxygenation, suggesting that, in our system,
the Akt/mTOR pathway might affect HIF-1 a levels by
promoting protein translation as previously described [20]. We
also observed Akt activation in the in vitro protocol of D/R,
correlating with HIF-1 a protein induction. Moreover, previous
works of our laboratory demonstrated that Akt is activated during
reperfusion in our model of I/R [11].
Akt activation by I/R in several organs including kidney has
been already reported [21]. In vitro, in a model of H/R which did
not include nutrient alterations Kwon et al., 2006 [22] described
PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2 activation during reoxygenation. In our
H/R protocol, Akt is probably activated through growth factors
and might involve Ras, which is also activated in our H/R
protocol, as previous works of our laboratory reported [23]. It is
well established that Ras activation might lead to p70S6K
phosphorylation through ERK, contributing also to promote
translation [20]. On the other hand, it has been recently reported
that metabolic changes underlying cell adaptation to deprivation/
replenishement of nutrients can lead also to HIF-1 a stabilization,
by specific inhibition of PHDs [24]. Thus, alterations in metabolic
intermediaries could also contribute to the normoxic HIF-1 a
induction reported here.
Outstandingly, in human biopsies, HIF-1 a was exclusively
detected in proximal tubule cells which did not exhibit marked
ischemic damage or show regeneration features. Moreover, the
strongest expression of HIF-1 a was observed in the biopsies which
clearly exhibited tubule regeneration (biopsy nu4). Additionally, in
the in vivo I/R rat model, HIF-1 a is induced during reperfusion
when tubule repair is taking place and renal function is being
restored [25,9], strongly suggesting that HIF-1 a mediates
proximal cell survival/regeneration during I/R. Proving this
hypothesis, our in vitro findings show that both HIF-1 a inductions
are critical for HK2 cells survival during H/R. Indeed, inhibition
of both HIF-1 a inductions by specific siRNA or YC-1, lead to cell
death. Notably, neither siRNA nor YC-1 affects Akt activation
during reoxygenation.
HIF-1 a mediates proximal tubule cell survival in response to
hypoxia as the result of cell adaptation to low oxygen tension.

HIF-1a Promotes Tubule Repair after I/R
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 6 March 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 3 | e33258

Indeed, promotion of HIF-1 a previous to hypoxia/ischemia in in
vivo models inhibited proximal tubule cell death and reduced renal
damage [10]. By contrast, the lack of HIF-1 a stabilization
promoted cell death after ischemia [9,26]. Hypoxia-induced HIF￾1 a is also at the base of the beneficial effects of ischemic
preconditioning [27]. Until now, no research has considered HIF￾1 a induction during reperfusion as a crucial factor for proximal
epithelial cell regeneration during I/R, which our results strongly
suggest.
Both HIF-1 a protein inductions lead to target gene expression
as luciferase assays showed which most probably mediates HIF-1 a
effects. PHD3 induction was the most prominent induced gene
during hypoxia as previously demonstrated [28]. Both PHD3 and
VEGF remained elevated during reoxygenation might be due to
second HIF-1 a induction, as the D/R protocol suggested.
Maintained PHD3 levels until 3–6 h of reoxygenation could
contribute to further degradation of the normoxic HIF-1 a
stabilization. Notably, EPO mRNA expression showed a robust
induction at 3 h of reoxygenation suggesting a main regulation of
this gene during reperfusion. Thus it is conceivable that the two
HIF-1 a inductions might result in differential gene expression
related to different roles of HIF-1 a in the proximal tubule cell
response to I/R. Indeed, the first HIF-1 a induction might control
the cell adaptation response to hypoxia and the second induction
during reperfusion might mediate proximal tubule repair.
The HIF-1 a target genes EPO and VEGF, which were
markedly expressed during reoxygenation in vitro, would be
involved in proximal tubule regeneration in vivo as previously
suggested [29,30,31]. This hypothesis is supported by our qRT￾PCR findings in rats. Related to this, we demonstrated a
significant negative correlation between HIF-1 a expression and
ATN development. Accordingly, it was proposed that the
expression of HIF-1 a in human allograft biopsies could
contribute to ameliorate renal damage associated with re-flow
and improve renal allograft outcome [18]. On the other hand, it
is important to note that the long sustained expression of HIF-1 a
and VEGF has been also related with immunological renal
allograft rejection as well as fibrosis development [32]. Therefore,
further studies on long term human allograft biopsies are required
to assess this issue.
Remarkably in our work and consistent with the human
biopsies, interference of reperfusion-induced HIF-1 a in rats
aggravates renal damage in structure and function, demonstrating
that this normoxic HIF-1 a induction by itself is crucial for renal
outcome after I/R. Although creatinine and urea return to normal
levels in both scramble and siRNA rats, kidney structure is
impaired for longer in interfered rats. It is well known that even if
creatinine and urea normalize, renal function, in terms of ions re￾absorption and volume regulation could be still affected [33,34].
Thus, HIF-1 a induction during reperfusion would be a
requirement for renal structure and function recovery after
ischemic damage. In this regard, our laboratory recently
demonstrated that BN rats which recover faster from I/R-induced
renal damage, present higher levels of HIF-1 a and some of its
target genes [11]. Moreover, current studies of our lab indicate
that HIF-1a could contribute to renal tissue repair after I/R by
regulating the inflammatory response, including IL-1b expression,
among other mechanisms.
In summary, we are reporting here a novel HIF-1 a induction in
reperfusion after renal ischemia. This accumulation is critical for
epithelial cell survival and repair, promoting tissue repair genes
expression. Interventions based on HIF-1 a during reperfusion in
the post-transplant period could be an efficient therapy strategy to
improve renal allograft outcome.

study. Samples were fixed in formaldehyde, included in paraffin
and 4 mm slides were used for periodic acid-Schiff staining or for
immunohistochemistry. For biopsies, histopathologic evaluation
was performed in a blinded fashion by two independent observers.
Tissue sections were rated from (2) to (++++), scoring morpho￾logical alterations in proximal tubule cells, brush border loss,
detached and necrotic cells in proximal tubules and presence of
intraluminal casts and infiltrating cells.
Immunostaining was performed as previously described [23],
using as primary antibodies anti-HIF-1 a (Santa Cruz) 1:25. Slides
were observed with Nikon Eclipse 200T microscopy.
I/R model in rat: Ethics Statement. Pimonidazole
treatment and immunohistochemistry
Male Sprague-Dawley rats (180–200 g) from our own colony
were divided in groups of 5–7 animals for each condition. Animals
were treated according to the Spanish guidelines (RD 1201/2005)
that are in compliance with the EU Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals. The experimental protocol was approved by
the Internal Committee for Animal Ethics of Hospital Universi￾tario Ramo´n y Cajal. Rats were anesthetized with an inhaled
anesthesia mixture of 2% isoflurane (Abbott Laboratories Ltd.,
Queenborough, Kent, England) and 1 l/min oxygen and placed
on a temperature-regulated table (37uC). Renal ischemia was
performed by clamping both renal pedicles during 45 min. Sham￾operated group underwent the same surgical procedure without
clamping. Animals were sacrificed at different times of reperfusion
and kidneys were harvested.
In the case of ischemia condition, 60 mg/Kg of pimonidazole
(Hydroxyprobe TM-1) was injected intraperitonealy 60 minutes
before clamping and animal were sacrificed after ischemia. In the
case of 5 days of reperfusion (R-5d), the same pimonidazole
concentration was injected 60 minutes before sacrifice.
Immunohistochemistry for HIF-1 a in kidney rat sections was
performed as described above for human biopsies. For pimonida￾zole staining Hydroxyprobe TM-1 Mab1 (monoclonal antibody
HRP conjugated) at 1:50 was used.
Cell culture, H/R and D/R in vitro protocol. Cell
treatments
HK-2 cells (ATCC) were cultured in DMEM/F12 containing
10% FBS, 1 g/l insulin, 0.55 g/l transferrin, 0.67 mg/l selenium
(Invitrogen), 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 mg/
ml streptomycin (Invitrogen), in a humidified atmosphere with 5%
CO2 at 37uC. Cells were cultured until confluence and then they
were serum deprived for 24 hours. Monolayers were cultured for
6 hours in HBSS (Invitrogen), in a hypoxic atmosphere containing
1% O2, 94% N2, 5% CO2 (Air Liquide). After hypoxia, cells were
maintained in complete medium and 21% O2 for reoxygenation
[12]. Serum-starved cells following 6 h in HBSS were used as
Control. For depletion/replenishment (D/R) protocol, cells were
subjected to all changes of media described above, but maintaining
standard 21% O2 (Figure 2A).
We used 10 mM YC-1 (3-(59-hydroxymethyl-29-furyl)-1-benzy￾lindazole) (Alexis Corporation), for HIF-1 a inhibition, 50 mM LY
294002 (Calbiochem) for Akt inhibition and 20 nM rapamycin
(Calbiochem) for mTOR inhibition.
Western blotting: Tissue and cell lysates
Western blotting in tissue and cells were performed as
previously described [11]. We used 1/250 for anti-human anti￾HIF-1 a (BD Transduction Laboratories); 1/1000 for p-AKT (Cell
Signalling), for total Akt (Cell Signalling) and for total actin (Santa
Cruz); 1/500 for p-S6Kp70 (Cell Signalling).
HIF-1 a siRNA transfection in vitro and in vivo
HK2 at 70% of confluence were transfected with 100 nM of
4 different HIF-1 a siRNAs (Customized Silencer Select
siRNAs: S225214, S225215, S225216 Ambion; siRNA sc￾44225, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) and scramble siRNA (sc￾Table 1. Human postransplant Renal Biopsies features.

37007, Sta Cruz Biotechnologies), using Lipofectamine 2000
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Transfected cells
were subjected to H/R after 48 h of transfection. siRNA sc￾44225 (Sta. Cruz) was selected for the in vitro experiments due
to its high efficiency.
In vivo, siRNA sc-44225 containing 3 sequences against 3
different HIF-1 a exons, was used for HIF-1 a inhibition. 75 mg/
kg body weight of siRNA mixed with Jetpei (Polyplus, Genycell)
following manufacturer’s instructions was injected to animals, by
the tail vein, 48 h or 72 h before sacrifice, as detailed in figure 7.

Cell death quantification
For each sample supernatants containing detached and death
cells were collected and attached cells were trypsinized. Cell
suspensions were stained with 50 mg/ml propidium iodide (PI) in
PBS containing 0.1% NP40.
Cell cycle distribution was determined using a Beckton
Dickinson FACScan flow cytometer, analysing 20.000 cells per
sample. The percentage of cells in sub-G1 phase (apoptotic cells)
was estimated using Modfit 2.0 software (Beckton Dickinson).
Quantitative RT-PCR
Cells or renal tissue were lysed into 1 ml of Tri-Reagent
(Ambion). Total RNA was extracted and quantified. cDNA was
obtained from 1 mg of total RNA from each sample (Improm-II
reverse transcriptase, Promega) and 1 ml of cDNA sample was
used as template for PCR with LC Fast Start DNA master SYBR
Green I kit (Roche Applied Science) following the manufacturer’s
instructions. PCR were carried out in Lightcycler 480 equipment
(Roche). For each sample and experiment, triplicates were made
and normalized by 28S mRNA levels. Primer pairs used are shown
in table 3.
Luciferase assays
HK-2 cells seeded on 24-well plates were transiently transfected
with 9xHRE-luc-PGLN3 (prolactin minimum promoter) [15]
(800 ng/well) and renillaluc-pSRLV40 (0,4 ng/well) using Lipo￾fectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After 24 h of transfection, cells were
subjected to H/R. Cells were lysed and luciferase activity was
estimated using Promega Dual Luciferase Kit (Promega). Results
were expressed as the ratio firefly luciferase/renilla luciferase
counts. All data are expressed as mean 6 SEM.
Statistical analysis
Data are presented as mean 6 SEM. After the Levene test of
homogeneity of variance, the Kruskal-Wallis test was used for
group comparison. A p,0.05 was considered significant. In case of
significant differences, intergroup differences were analyzed by
post-hoc Mann-Whitney U tests with the Bonferroni correction.
Spearman Rho correlation coefficient was used for analysis in
human biopsies. Statistical analysis was carried out with Statistical
Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 15.0.
