Abstract
Background: Phlebotomy induces regression of liver fibrosis in ge￾netic hemochromatosis. We assessed the histologic changes in pre￾phlebotomy and post-phlebotomy liver biopsies from patients with 
HFE mutation as a model to study regression of fibrosis. We aimed to 
show that phlebotomy-induced histologic lesions overlap with porto￾sinusoidal vascular disease (PSVD, also known as idiopathic non￾cirrhotic portal hypertension), histologically.
Methods: A total of 51 biopsies (22 pre-phlebotomy and 29 post￾phlebotomy) were reviewed, and three variables were studied: iron 
index indicative of the amount of accumulated iron (range 0 to 18), 
the combined score of vascular changes reflecting the presence of his￾tological lesions that are described in PSVD (range 0 to 9) and the 
high-grade shunt vessel by calculating the proportion of portal tracts 
with shunt vessels, with a cutoff of 50%. Two-tailed Student’s t-test 
and Fisher’s exact test were performed to compare the means of two 
variables and frequencies of the histologic lesions in two groups, re￾spectively. A P-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results: The iron index was higher in the pre-phlebotomy compared 
to post-phlebotomy group (P = 0.01). Compared to the pre-phlebotomy 
group, the combined score was higher in the post-phlebotomy group 
when the cases of advanced fibrosis were excluded (P = 0.023) and 
remained higher when patients with risk factors for PSVD were further 
excluded (P = 0.034). The high-grade shunt vessel tended to be more 
common in the post-phlebotomy group when advanced fibrosis was ex￾cluded; however, the statistical significance was marginal (P = 0.056).
Conclusions: Phlebotomy reduces hepatic iron load and induces his￾tologic lesions of PSVD in patients with HFE mutation. Our data sup￾port a postulation that some of the histologic lesions of PSVD represent 
vascular remodeling following a regression of fibrosis and may not be 
reflective of risk factors or etiopathogenesis of PSVD. Regressed fibro￾sis and PSVD may not be reliably distinguished in a limited sample, 
therefore warranting cautious interpretation in the right clinical context.

Introduction
Progression of hepatic fibrosis is a result of continuous re￾modeling in response to chronic insult to the liver. In the past, 
cirrhosis was considered an irreversible end stage of hepatic 
injury [1]. However, recent studies have shown that advanced 
fibrosis and cirrhosis is reversible when the underlying liver 
condition causing the injury is treated. Examples include re￾versal of liver fibrosis in chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) and 
hepatitis C virus (HCV)-induced hepatitis following treatment 
with interferon and/or nucleoside analogues and antivirals 
[2-6], and down-staging of fibrosis of autoimmune hepatitis 
following immunosuppressive treatment [7]. Similarly, serial 
liver biopsies from genetic hemochromatosis patients showed 
regression of fibrosis following phlebotomy treatment [8].
Idiopathic non-cirrhotic portal hypertension (INCPH) is a 
clinicopathologic entity in which liver samples from patients 
with clinical evidence of portal hypertension fail to show cir￾rhosis in the absence of other causes of portal hypertension 
[9-13]. Recently, the Vascular Liver Disease Interest Group 
(VALDIG) proposed a novel terminology “porto-sinusoidal 
vascular disease (PSVD)” in order to broaden the definition 
of INCPH and capture the earlier phase of the disease preced￾ing portal hypertension [14]. Histologically, PSVD shows sub￾tle vascular changes and associated histologic findings such 
as obliterative portal venopathy, nodular regenerative hyper￾plasia, incomplete septal fibrosis, portal tract abnormalities, 
architectural disturbance, non-zonal sinusoidal dilatation and 
mild perisinusoidal fibrosis, in the absence of cirrhosis [14]. 
Common risk factors include infectious etiology, hypercoagu￾lability, rheumatologic and immunologic conditions, exposure 
to toxin/drug and genetic predisposition [9-14].
Compared to the description of subtle and variable histo￾logic lesions of PSVD, histologic overlap between regressed 
fibrosis and PSVD in liver biopsy is less well documented in 
the literature. Dr. Wanless and other authors postulated that in￾Manuscript submitted October 19, 2019, accepted November 12, 2019

complete septal cirrhosis, a histologic lesion of PSVD [15, 16], 
represents a form of regressed fibrosis [17, 18].
Therefore, regression of fibrosis may pose a diagnostic 
challenge to clinicians and pathologists when a pertinent clini￾cal history of chronic hepatitis, advanced fibrosis and treat￾ment is unavailable, or when the histologic overlap between 
regressed fibrosis and PSVD is not recognized. Some of these 
biopsies may be interpreted as featuring histologic lesions of 
PSVD, which may lead to an unnecessary search for risk fac￾tors of PSVD, while underlying chronic hepatitis and possible 
regression of fibrosis are overlooked.
We recently encountered a liver biopsy from a patient 
with a past history of genetic hemochromatosis and cirrhosis. 
The biopsy showed neither parenchymal iron deposits nor fi￾brosis. The biopsy was remarkable for variable histologic le￾sions of PSVD, including an increased number of portal ve￾nous branches in portal tracts, obliterative portal venopathy, 
sinusoidal dilatation and nodular regeneration of the lobules. 
Further clinical history of regular phlebotomy was noted, and 
these histologic changes were attributed to regression of fibro￾sis following phlebotomy.
We hypothesize that review of pre-phlebotomy and post￾phlebotomy liver samples of genetic hemochromatosis patients 
may provide direct histologic evidence of regressed fibrosis 
that is within the spectrum of PSVD. While the optimal study 
material would consist of sequential pre-phlebotomy and post￾phlebotomy liver biopsies from a hemochromatosis patient co￾hort, such a cohort is unavailable at our institutions. Therefore, 
as an alternative, we studied liver biopsies from patients with 
known HFE gene mutation and compared pre-phlebotomy and 
post-phlebotomy biopsies. The goal of the study was to com￾pare pre-phlebotomy and post-phlebotomy liver samples from 
HFE mutation cohort and evaluate histologic changes that can 
be seen in PSVD.
Unfortunately, there is no standardized method to quantify 
the degree or amount of individual histologic lesions pertaining 
to PSVD that correlates with clinical signs of portal hyperten￾sion [14, 19]. Also, it is unknown how many of these individual 
histologic features or any combination thereof, is required to 
make a histologic diagnosis of PSVD or predict portal hyperten￾sion. Therefore, as previously devised and utilized [10, 11], the 
individual histologic lesions of PSVD were evaluated for the 
absence (score 0) or presence (score 1) of the lesions, and the 
combined score (CS) of the individual lesions was assessed.
Materials and Methods
The study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards 
at the Albany Medical Center and Cleveland Clinic, respec￾tively. This study was conducted in compliance with the ethi￾cal standards of the responsible institution on human subjects 
as well as with the Helsinki Declaration. A random search for 
patients who underwent liver biopsy or resection while car￾rying a diagnosis of hemochromatosis was performed, using 
International Classification of Diseases, Ninth and Tenth Revi￾sion (ICD-9 and -10). For outpatients, the Current Procedural 
Terminology (CPT) code was used.
Mutational status of C282Y and H63D, demographics and 
phlebotomy history were obtained from the electronic medical 
records. Cases of secondary/acquired siderosis without genetic 
abnormality were excluded. All available liver biopsies and re￾sections from the patients were retrieved.
Archived hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), trichrome, Prus￾sian blue and periodic acid-Schiff-diastase (PAS/D) stained 
slides prepared from the formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tis￾sue blocks at the time of the diagnoses were reviewed by two 
(TEJ and HL) pathologists, blinded to the phlebotomy history.
The number of portal tracts was counted and the degree 
of iron accumulation (see iron index below) and METAVIR 
fibrosis stage were evaluated. The individual histologic lesions 
of PSVD were evaluated for the absence or presence of the 
lesions, as previously devised [10, 11] (Table 1 [10, 20]) (Fig. 
1). The degree of shunt vessel (SV) was further quantified by 
enumerating the number of portal tracts with SVs in a given 
biopsy (see high-grade SV below). Due to overlapping his￾tologic features between fatty liver disease (FLD) and PSVD 
[10], histologic features of FLD were evaluated when present.
The above data were used to generate three quantifiable 
variables for the pre-phlebotomy and post-phlebotomy group: 
the CS of vascular changes, the iron index and the frequency 
of high-grade SV. Two-tailed Student’s t-test was performed 
when comparing the means of two groups. Fisher’s exact test 
was performed when comparing the frequencies of specific 
histologic features in two groups. A P value of less than 0.05 
was considered statistically significant.
CS of vascular changes
A score of 0 or 1 was assigned for the absence or presence 
of P3, P4, P5, P6, L1, L2, L5, L6 and L8. A CS ranging from 
0 to 9 was generated by summing the score of the histologic 
features for each biopsy, as previously used [10] (Table 1). The 
mean of those scores was calculated for both the pre-phleboto￾my and post-phlebotomy groups.
Iron index
This index was devised to assign a quantitative value for iron 
accumulation. An iron granularity (G) score of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 
6 was assigned when the iron granules were seen at × 40, × 
20, × 10, × 4, × 2, or grossly on the glass slide by the naked 
eye, respectively. An iron zonation (Z) score of 1, 2 and 3 was 
assigned when the iron granules were seen in hepatic zone 1, 
zones 1 and 2, and zones 1 to 3, respectively. In the absence 
of iron, both G and Z scores are 0. The iron index was defined 
as the G score multiplied by the Z score (G × Z). The mean of 
iron indices was calculated for both pre-phlebotomy and post￾phlebotomy groups.
High-grade SV
A biopsy was considered to have high-grade SV when ≥ 50%

of its portal tracts exhibited SVs. The percentage of pre-phle￾botomy and post-phlebotomy biopsies with high-grade SV 
was calculated.
Results
Demographics and hemochromatosis gene mutation
A total of 41 patients who met the study criteria were included 
in the analysis. There were 28 males and 13 females, with a 
mean age of 54 years, ranging from 17 to 83 years. Twenty￾nine patients were homozygotes for C282Y mutation, nine 
were homozygotes for H63D mutation, two were C282Y/
H63D heterozygotes and one was a C282Y carrier. Twelve 
patients had one or more potential risk factors of PSVD, in￾cluding immunologic dysregulation, rheumatologic disease, 
chronic venous outflow obstruction, malignancy, infection and 
exposure to drug. No patient had portal hypertension at the 
time of liver biopsy or resection.
Pre-phlebotomy and post-phlebotomy groups
Fifteen of 29 C282Y homozygotes, three of nine H63D ho￾mozygotes, both two C282Y/H63D heterozygotes and the 
C282Y carrier had undergone phlebotomy at the time of first 
liver biopsy. A set of pre-phlebotomy and post-phlebotomy bi￾opsy was available in five patients. In two additional patients, 
two or more serial post-phlebotomy biopsies were available 
for review. In total, 51 biopsies and resections were available 
for review, of which 22 were pre-phlebotomy and 29 were 
post-phlebotomy specimens.
In the pre-phlebotomy group, the biopsy was performed 
at the time of genetic hemochromatosis diagnosis in 11 cases, 
within 1 - 2 months of diagnosis in seven cases, and at 10 
years in one case. One patient had a liver biopsy 4.5 years 
prior to the diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis. The 
time of biopsy in relation to diagnosis was unknown in two 
patients.
In the post-phlebotomy group, the biopsy was done within 
1 year of diagnosis in four cases, 3 years in two cases, 5 - 10 
years in nine cases, 10 - 20 years in seven cases and > 20 years 
in three cases. The time of biopsy in relation to diagnosis was 
unknown in four cases. In this group, phlebotomy was per￾formed at variable frequencies, ranging from weekly to every 
6 months. Some patients underwent regular phlebotomies, 
whereas the rest did not.
Eight out of 22 (36%) cases in the pre-phlebotomy group 
and eight out of 29 cases (28%) in the post-phlebotomy group 
demonstrated advanced fibrosis (METAVIR F3 and F4); fre￾Table 1. Histological Features of Liver Biopsies and Definition [10, 20]

quencies of advanced fibrosis did not statistically differ be￾tween these two groups. Co-existing FLD was noted in 14 
out of 22 (64%) pre-phlebotomy and 14 out of 29 (48%) post￾phlebotomy specimens; frequencies of FLD were not statis￾tically different between these two groups. Three out of 22 
(14%) pre-phlebotomy and 10 of 29 (34%) post-phlebotomy 
cases showed incomplete fibrous septa (L5) on trichrome stain. 
The difference in the frequencies of incomplete fibrous septa 
was statistically insignificant. Incomplete fibrous septa with￾out centrizonal perisinusoidal fibrosis were seen only in two 
post-phlebotomy biopsies.
CS of vascular changes
The CS of vascular changes was not statistically different be￾tween pre-phlebotomy (n = 22) and post-phlebotomy (n = 29) 
groups (3.4 (pre-phlebotomy) vs. 3.9 (post-phlebotomy); P = 
0.160). However, exclusion of the cases with advanced fibro￾sis (METAVIR F3, F4) in both groups led to a remarkable in￾Figure 1. Representative images of histologic features evaluated. (a) Shunt vessels (*) herniating into the liver parenchyma

crease of the CS in the post-phlebotomy group compared to 
the pre-phlebotomy group (3.6 (pre-phlebotomy, n = 14) ver￾sus 4.8 (post-phlebotomy, n = 21); P = 0.023) with a statisti￾cal significance. When patients with potential risk factors for 
PSVD were further excluded, the CS in both groups remained 
unchanged, and statistical significance was maintained (3.6 
(pre-phlebotomy, n = 9) versus 4.8 (post-phlebotomy, n = 18); 
P = 0.034).
Iron index
This index was higher in the pre-phlebotomy group when com￾pared to the post-phlebotomy group (8.3 versus 4.3) with a 
statistical significance (P = 0.01).
High-grade SV
After cases with advanced fibrosis (METAVIR F3, F4) were 
excluded, only one of 14 (7%) pre-phlebotomy group cases 
showed high-grade SV, whereas it was present in eight of 21 
(38%) post-phlebotomy group cases. However, statistical sig￾nificance was marginal with a P value of 0.056 (Table 2).
Serial liver biopsies
Five sets of pre-phlebotomy and post-phlebotomy biopsies 
from five patients, and two sets of serial post-phlebotomy bi￾opsies from two patients were available. Among these, two pa￾tients that developed hepatocellular carcinoma in the second 
biopsies, one patient that had a progression of severe FLD and 
one that had persistent FLD were excluded from evaluation. 
Therefore, three sets of pre-phlebotomy and post-phlebotomy 
biopsies from three patients without confounding factors were 
finally evaluated. The duration of phlebotomy was 4 years and 
9 months, 1 year, and 3 years and 2 months, respectively.
In these three patients, compared to pre-phlebotomy bi￾opsies, post-phlebotomy biopsies showed reduction of META￾VIR fibrosis stage (F2 to F0, F3 to F2, and F2 to F0), and 
increased CS of vascular changes (3 to 7, 5 to 7, and 3 to 8). 
High-grade SV was present only in one post-phlebotomy bi￾opsy in the third patient.
Discussion
PSVD is a clinicopathologic entity of the liver comprised of 
subtle vascular lesions and associated histologic changes with￾out histologic evidence of cirrhosis [14]. These vascular and 
associated histologic changes are relatively well documented 
in PSVD with portal hypertension (previously known as IN￾CPH). However, their significance in the absence of clinical 
portal hypertension - PSVD without portal hypertension - re￾mains unclear. This may encompass heterogeneous entities 
with differing etiopathogenesis [10, 11, 14, 21]. The histologic 
lesions of PSVD were described in patients with and without 
risk factors for PSVD, in pediatric patients, in FLD, in autopsy 
liver, in liver biopsies obtained intraoperatively during chol￾ecystectomies and gastric bypasses, and in trauma patients 
without portal hypertension [10, 11, 21-25]. Regardless of 
their clinical annotation, histologic lesions of PSVD appear to 
represent a transient phase or an end result of heterogeneous 
perfusion, in association with obliterative portal venopathy, re￾generation and remodeling of the liver [10, 11, 22].
It has also been recognized that regression of liver fibrosis 
induces vascular changes that can be seen in PSVD. Wanless 
et al carried out a meticulous morphometric evaluation of re￾gression of fibrosis in liver samples from serial biopsies and 52 
liver explants, and showed that regression of fibrosis from mi￾cro- and macronodular cirrhosis to incomplete septal cirrhosis 
results in variable histologic changes such as thin fibrous sep￾ta, rudimentary portal tracts, regenerative nodules and aberrant 
arrangement of hepatic veins [17]. Schinoni et al described re￾generative nodules, hypoplastic portal tracts, periportal fibro￾sis, altered lobular architecture, phlebosclerosis and SVs (de￾scribed as dilated thin-walled vessels in the interface between 
the portal tract and parenchyma) in their study of incomplete 
septal cirrhosis [18]. These histologic lesions are well docu￾mented in PSVD [9, 12-14]. Likewise, Sciot et al documented 
similarities in histologic features between incomplete septal

cirrhosis and PSVD suggesting a common etiopathogenesis, 
while the authors considered incomplete septal cirrhosis as a 
subtype of cirrhosis [15].
We chose an HFE mutation cohort to study histologic 
changes related to regression of fibrosis due to phlebotomy’s 
known role in the regression of fibrosis in genetic hemochro￾matosis [8], and because hepatic iron accumulation is a quanti￾fiable histologic variable that can be used to confirm the effect 
of phlebotomy. As anticipated, the iron index was higher in 
the pre-phlebotomy group than in the post-phlebotomy group. 
This confirms that the effect of phlebotomy represented by 
a lower iron index is evident in the post-phlebotomy group, 
while the frequencies of advanced fibrosis and FLD are not 
statistically different from those in the pre-phlebotomy group, 
and validates our study design.
We have shown that histologic lesions that can be seen in 
PSVD are more pronounced in the post-phlebotomy group than 
in the pre-phlebotomy group, especially when confounding fac￾tors such as advanced fibrosis are excluded. Similarly, although 
the P value was marginal, the frequency of high-grade SV in the 
post-phlebotomy group tended to be higher than that of the pre￾phlebotomy group. These results support the notion that phle￾botomy leads to vascular and histologic changes that resemble 
PSVD in patients with hemochromatosis gene mutation.
Falize et al looked at the METAVIR fibrosis stage of 
pre-phlebotomy and post-phlebotomy biopsies from genetic 
hemochromatosis patients. The authors showed that among 36 
patients with pre-phlebotomy stage of F3 or F4, 21 patients 
demonstrated reduction in fibrosis following phlebotomy, of 
which 14 patients showed minimal fibrosis (F0 to F1) in post￾phlebotomy biopsies. Interestingly, one patient in their study 
showed cirrhosis (METAVIR F4) in the initial biopsy and no 
fibrosis (F0) in the post-phlebotomy biopsy [8]. While the 
authors did not evaluate histologic features of PSVD in their 
study, and despite having only three patients with serial biop￾sies without significant confounding factors in our study, the 
post-phlebotomy biopsies in our study showed down-staging 
of the METAVIR fibrosis score and higher combined vascular 
scores than those in the pre-phlebotomy biopsies. These obser￾vations further support the notion that regression and resorp￾tion of fibrosis may be associated with PSVD-like histologic 
changes in liver biopsy.
Given the overlapping histologic features between re￾gressed fibrosis and PSVD, from a histologic standpoint, dis￾tinguishing between these two would be extremely challeng￾ing unless pertinent histories and clinical contexts are provided 
and the histologic overlap is recognized. Even so, recognition 
of regressed fibrosis or incomplete septal cirrhosis appears to 
be difficult especially in biopsy samples [15]. In Wanless et 
al’s study regarding regression of fibrosis, the samples were 
mainly from explant specimens except from one patient with 
serial core needle biopsies [17]. Likewise, Ibarrola et al suc￾cessfully identified one case of incomplete septal cirrhosis out 
of nine PSVD cases. However, the specimens from this study 
were from autopsies and liver resections [16]. Incomplete sep￾tal cirrhosis associated with Wegener’s granulomatosis was 
also diagnosed on autopsy [26]. As the presence of incomplete 
fibrous septa with no perisinusoidal fibrosis appeared specific 
for incomplete septal cirrhosis in Ibarrola’s study, we looked 
at the frequency of incomplete fibrous septa (L5) in our cases. 
There was a trend of increased frequency of incomplete fibrous 
septa in the post-phlebotomy group. However, statistical sig￾nificance was not reached, and most of these cases had co￾existing perisinusoidal fibrosis due to superimposed FLD.
We agree with previous postulations that regression of 
fibrosis appears to represent a transient phase of a dynamic 
process consisting of repeated injury, scarring and resorption 
of fibrosis. This continuous remodeling appears to be associ￾ated with, or conducive to heterogeneous perfusion of the liver 
and obliterative portal venopathy. Any type of chronic hepati￾tis would undergo this continuous remodeling process. In his 
original definition of incomplete septal cirrhosis, Dr. Popper 
noticed that this is frequently associated with alcoholic and 
viral hepatitis [27]. Subsequently, incomplete septal cirrhosis 
was reported in HBV hepatitis, HCV hepatitis, alcoholic hepa￾titis, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, Wegener’s granulomato￾sis, following high-dose methylprednisolone and as idiopathic 
[17, 26, 28]. Similarly, Schinoni et al performed a histomor￾phologic study of eight incomplete septal cirrhosis cases and 
reported that five of eight patients had known chronic hepa￾titis due to autoimmune disease, alcohol and HCV. The sam￾ples showed varying stages of progression and regression of 
inflammation and fibrosis, suggesting that incomplete septal 
cirrhosis is an intermediate stage of the remodeling process 
[18]. Our observation in this study that phlebotomy induces 
PSVD-like histologic lesions, likely by resorption of fibrosis 
and remodeling, further supports this postulation.
The limitations of our study include a relatively low case 
number after exclusion of METAVIR F3 and F4 cases, and 
frequent co-existence with FLD that confounded histologic 
evaluation. However, despite the low case number, statistical 
significance was maintained before and after excluding cases 
with risk factors for PSVD in CS calculation. Also, the degree 
of iron overload and baseline liver injury was uneven. For ex￾ample, a relatively young patient (17-year-old) and six patients 
with H63D homozygosity were included in the pre-phleboto￾my group. However, the iron index was lower in the post-phle￾botomy group compared to that in the pre-phlebotomy group, 
and there were three patients with H63D homozygosity in the 
post-phlebotomy group. Moreover, a minor subset of patients 
with H63D mutation may manifest clinically significant iron 
overload [29]. Therefore, we believe that the study design was 
adequate in addressing the study goal. Lastly, whether hepa￾tocellular anisocytosis can be used as a surrogate for nodular 
regeneration or not is to be validated.
There are no standardized histopathologic diagnostic cri￾teria to render a diagnosis of PSVD in a liver biopsy. Some 
authors devised grading schemes or arbitrary histologic crite￾ria for their studies and applied them to cases of PSVD with 
portal hypertension; however, the grading schemes and pro￾posed diagnostic criteria did not correlate with clinical out￾come including signs of portal hypertension, hemodynamic 
status and coagulability [19, 30]. The diagnosis of PSVD is 
further compounded by high interobserver variability [31, 32]. 
The scoring scheme we devised and used for the previous stud￾ies and current study is our attempt to address the subtle and 
somewhat subjective histologic changes of PSVD in a simple 
and systemic manner [10, 11].

Conclusion
Liver biopsy interpretation plays a crucial role in rendering a 
diagnosis of PSVD. When subtle histologic features of PSVD 
are encountered in liver biopsies without portal hypertension 
in patients with any form of chronic hepatitis or liver injury, 
ongoing remodeling process may account for the histologic le￾sions. When these features are seen in the absence of known 
chronic hepatitis, liver injury or signs of portal hypertension, 
some of them would fulfill the recently proposed diagnostic 
criteria for “PSVD without portal hypertension”, with risk fac￾tors for PSVD in a subset [11, 14]. When there is a clinical 
history of portal hypertension in biopsies featuring histologic 
lesions of PSVD without cirrhosis, a diagnosis of “PSVD with 
portal hypertension” would be justified, however, with a ca￾veat that some of these biopsies may represent regressed cir￾rhosis and may be unrelated to risk factors of PSVD.
