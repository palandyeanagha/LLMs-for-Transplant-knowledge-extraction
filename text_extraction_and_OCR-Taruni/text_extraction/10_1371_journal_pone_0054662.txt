Abstract
Background: Patients with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) are particularly vulnerable to development of Diabetic nephropathy (DN)
leading to End Stage Renal Disease. Hence a better understanding of the factors affecting kidney disease progression in T1D
is urgently needed. In recent years microRNAs have emerged as important post-transcriptional regulators of gene
expression in many different health conditions. We hypothesized that urinary microRNA profile of patients will differ in the
different stages of diabetic renal disease.
Methods and Findings: We studied urine microRNA profiles with qPCR in 40 T1D with .20 year follow up 10 who never
developed renal disease (N) matched against 10 patients who went on to develop overt nephropathy (DN), 10 patients with
intermittent microalbuminuria (IMA) matched against 10 patients with persistent (PMA) microalbuminuria. A Bayesian
procedure was used to normalize and convert raw signals to expression ratios. We applied formal statistical techniques to
translate fold changes to profiles of microRNA targets which were then used to make inferences about biological pathways
in the Gene Ontology and REACTOME structured vocabularies. A total of 27 microRNAs were found to be present at
significantly different levels in different stages of untreated nephropathy. These microRNAs mapped to overlapping
pathways pertaining to growth factor signaling and renal fibrosis known to be targeted in diabetic kidney disease.
Conclusions: Urinary microRNA profiles differ across the different stages of diabetic nephropathy. Previous work using
experimental, clinical chemistry or biopsy samples has demonstrated differential expression of many of these microRNAs in
a variety of chronic renal conditions and diabetes. Combining expression ratios of microRNAs with formal inferences about
their predicted mRNA targets and associated biological pathways may yield useful markers for early diagnosis and risk
stratification of DN in T1D by inferring the alteration of renal molecular processes.

Introduction
Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is the leading cause of End Stage
Renal Disease (ESRD) in the Western world, accounting for more
than 40% of cases. Patients with either type 1 (T1D) or 2 (T2D)
diabetes are at risk of DN, but the disease burden is higher in the
former group [1]. Hence a better understanding of the factors
affecting disease progression(2) from hyperfiltration to microalbu￾minuria(MA), dipstick positive macroalbuminuria, impaired filtra￾tion and ESRD in patients with T1D is urgently needed. The
molecular pathophysiology [2] of diabetic nephropathy is multi￾factorial, involving hemodynamic factors (Vascular Endothelial
Growth Factor, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and endothelin
systems), proinflammatory (e.g. Interleykin IL-1, 6,18) and
profibrotic cytokines (such as Transforming Growth Factor beta,
TGFb) as well as other biochemical derangements (polyol, Protein
Kinase C). Nevertheless, the manner in which these diverse
molecular processes are regulated, resulting in distinct clinical
courses of individual patients remains poorly defined.
In recent years microRNAs (miRNAs), a family of short
(average of 22nt long), naturally occurring, small antisense non￾coding RNAs have emerged as important post-transcriptional
regulators of gene expression (see review [3]). First described in C.
elegans [4], they have since been discovered to be widely
distributed, endogenous controllers of gene and protein expression
by binding to the 39-untranslated region of specific mRNAs and

interfering with protein synthesis by inducing mRNA degradation
or repressing translation [5,6]. A number of these miRNAs have
also been identified in the extracellular environment. As they may
regulate a significant portion of the transcriptome and proteome,
considerable attention has focused on miRNAs as mediators or
biomarkers of illness. Previous work in diabetic renal disease (see
reviews [7–10]) performed in cell cultures, animal models or
formalin fixed human biopsy material has linked a number of
miRNAs to the development of nephropathy. Nevertheless, there
have been no comprehensive studies examining miRNA signatures
in human urine in relation to either longitudinal clinical outcomes
and/or the level of urinary albumin, which is the current gold
standard for detecting and staging diabetic nephropathy in the
clinic. The goal of this pilot study is to identify the differences on
urinary miRNA profiles in patients with long standing T1D who
were either free from diabetic nephropathy or had developed
variable degrees of albuminuria after long follow-up. In addition,
by integrating experimentally verified alterations on urinary
miRNAs with miRNA target prediction databases, we translated
the changes of miRNAs into hypotheses about signalling pathways
associated with nephropathy induced by diabetes.
Materials and Methods
Patients and Samples
Urine samples from participants in the Pittsburgh Epidemiology
of Diabetes Complications (EDC) study were examined. The EDC
study is a historical prospective cohort which recruited patients
from Children’s University Hospital of Pittsburgh Registry of all
cases of T1D, diagnosed or seen within a year of diagnosis between
January 1st 1950 and May 31st 1980. Participants were followed
thereafter with repeat exams biennially for 10 years and again at
18 years. Follow up of all participants in the EDC was censored for
this analysis on December 31st 2000.
In the EDC, diabetic renal disease was characterized in terms of
its progression from a normoalbuminuric urine examination to
progressively higher amounts of albumin in the urine (microalbu￾minuria) to overt nephropathy. Microalbuminuria was defined as
20–200 mg/min in at least two of three timed urines (24hr,
overnight, and 4 hr clinic visit) and was further classified as
intermittent(IMA) or persistent (PMA) on the basis of subsequently
reverting to normoalbuminuria or persisting at least to microal￾buminuria level throughout further follow up respectively. Diabetic
nephropathy was defined as an albumin excretion rate .200 mg/min
in at least two of three timed urine collections (24-h, overnight,
and post-clinic). In the absence of urine, a serum creatinine
.2 mg/dl or renal failure was accepted as an alternative
diagnostic criterion for overt nephropathy. For the purpose of
this report we analyzed urine from matched samples of a) diabetic
patients who never developed microalbuminuria or nephropathy
after prolonged (25 year) follow – up vs. those with DN and b)
patients who developed IMA matched against EDC participants
who developed PMA. In the case of the N v DN group we
collected a single urine sample, while two samples were analyzed
from patients who developed microalbuminuria : a (baseline)urine
sample from the last visit which tested negative for albumin and
the subsequent (follow-up, albuminuric) sample which was
collected 2 years after the first. Matching in the 2 sample sets
was independently carried out on the basis of age, sex, duration of
disease and levels of Hemoglobin A1c (HBA1c) to account for
unmeasured confounders.
RNA Isolation
The RNA from urine was isolated using the miRNeasy kit
(Qiagen, Germantown, MD). In brief, 700 ml of QIAzol reagent
was added to 200 ml of urine sample. The sample was mixed in a
tube followed by adding 140 ml of chloroform. After mixing
vigorously for 15 seconds, the sample was then centrifuged at
12,0006g for 15 minutes at 4uC. The upper aqueous phase was
carefully transferred to a new collection tube, and 1.5 volume of
ethanol containing binding buffer from the kit was added and
mixed. The sample was then applied directly to a silica
membrane containing column and the RNA was retained and
cleaned by using buffers provided in the kit. The immobilized
cleaned RNA was then eluted from the membrane into a
collection tube with a low salt elution buffer or water. The quality
and quantity of the RNA was evaluated by 260/280 ratio and
Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara
CA).
miRNA Profiling
In brief, the cDNA was generated from 20 ml of RNA using
buffer and enzyme provide in the Qiagen kit. After incubating the
cDNA synthesis reaction at 42uC for 60 minutes, the cDNA was
diluted to 8 ml with SYBR containing PCR reagents from
Exiqon and water. The plates were then loaded onto ABI
7900HT real-time PCR system and the threshold cycle (Ct) was
measured with standard methods. Exiqon miRNA qPCR panels
1 and 2 (Version 1) were used, that included probes for 748
unique miRNA. Each miRNA species was assayed once per panel
with the exception of miR-423-5p, miR-103, miR-191 and the
three non-coding RNA species U6, SNORD38B and
SNORD39A for which duplicate reactions was set up as per
panel manufacturer instructions. Although suggested as reference
genes (biological controls) by the panel manufacturer the 6
microRNAs/small nuclear RNAs were not used as referents
during normalization. Nevertheless their presence in multiple
technical replicates in any given panel, allowed us to derive panel
specific normalization factors which were applied to the raw
expression levels of all microRNAs. A single inter-plate calibrator
spiked in control (UniSP3) was run 6 times per plate and was used
to normalize the expression levels of all miRNAs included in each
of the qPCR panels. A second spiked in control (UniSP6) was
included in some but not all urine reactions as a dual positive –
negative control and was thus not considered in subsequent
analyses (including normalization). We also included a no￾template negative control in all assays (nine replicates per assay)
as per manufacture guidelines. To resolve discrepancies in the
nomenclature of miRNA species, we mapped names of miRNAs
present in the Exiqon plates to the most current ones in miRBase
(version 18, November 2011) and the associated MIMAT
accession numbers (Table S1).

visualization, signal analysis and normalization. In order
to classify individual patient samples and visualize the resemblance
in the corresponding profiles we applied Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) to the corrected Cq values obtained from the raw
Cq measurements after subtracting the quantification cycle
number of the spiked-in control. To handle missing data in the
expression of miRNAs across samples we applied a specific variety
of PCA, i.e. Probabilistic PCA (PPCA) [11] that combines the
Expectation Maximization (EM) with PCA to simultaneous
estimate missing expression values and the principal components
in the dataset. Results of PPCA were plotted as bivariate

scatterplots, in which each principal component is plotted against
all others. PPCA calculations were performed with the ‘‘pca￾Methods’’ package [12] in bioconductor [13].
To analyze the difference in miRNA expression within patient
groups, we quantified the relative expression level of each miRNA,
its normalized threshold cycle difference (DCq) i.e. the difference
Figure 1. Schematic representation of the normalization procedure and estimation of relative fold changes adopted in the
manuscript. Replicate qPCR reactions were analyzed with a hierarchical linear mixed model in order to estimate panel specific correction factors
that were subtracted from the raw Cq signals of unreplicated reactions (first step), while simultaneously estimating the difference (DCq) between an
experimental and referent state. In the second step, the DCq of the spiked in control was subtracted from the non-control DCq values to calibrate the
relative fold changes according to the Delta-Delta method. Both steps of the normalization procedure acknowledged the uncertainty implicit in
estimating the DCq of both control and non-control signals (shown as a density plot at the bottom part of the figure), by performing this subtraction
probabilistically i.e. by Monte Carlo methods.

between the quantification cycle in the experimental (E) and the
reference (R) state : DCq= Cq(E) – Cq(R), with positive DCq values
indicating lower concentrations. To ensure a sufficient amount of
data for downstream analyses, only those miRNAs that were
detected in at least 2/3 of patient samples in each comparison
were analyzed.
A mixed effects model was used simultaneously accounting for
matching patients within pairs while normalizing DCq values for
PCR related factors. Normalization of quantification cycle signals
occurred in two steps (Figure 1): first, we developed a regression
model that utilized the multiple replicates in the qPCR panels to
decompose the corresponding measurements into signal and
(panel/PCR) specific noise factors. Secondly, the difference in
the expression level of the spiked in (UniSp3) control was used to
calibrate relative fold changes (FC) by the Delta-Delta method [14,15]
as: FC = 22DDCq, where DDCq= DCq(miRNA) – DCq(UniSp3).
The parameters of the regression model were estimated from a
Bayesian probabilistic viewpoint, a decision justified by the
exploratory, hypothesis generating [16] nature of this work and
the amenability of the complex mixed models utilized to Bayesian
computational methods. In this study we used ‘‘objective’’,
likelihood-dominated, non-informative priors [17] due to the lack
of previous information that could be used to specify prior beliefs
for the levels of the miRNAs examined.
Bayesian models were programmed in the BUGS language
(Text S1 sections Bayesian Computations and WinBUGS code)
[18]. Statistics (means, standard errors) of posterior probability
MCMC samples were used to summarize inferences about
individual DCq values, while the degree to which each estimated
DCq differs from zero was quantitated by means of symmetric
pseudocontour probabilities which can be viewed as Bayesian analogs
of p-values [19]. 95% Posterior Density Credible (symmetric)
Intervals (CrI) were used to provide a range of values in which the
estimated DCq lie with a probability of 95%.
miRNA target functional profiling. To infer putative
targets of differentially expressed miRNAs we utilized three
different algorithms: miRanda (release August 2010) [20],
TargetSCan (release 6, November 2011) [21] and miRDB (version
4.0, January 2012) [22]. In order to declare a specific mRNA as a
target of a given miRNA species, we required that at least 2 of the
3 databases predict the latter to bind to the former. To leverage
the quantitative urinary expression profiles and miRNA target
database information into more concrete predictions we appealed
to a biochemical argument based on Hill plots. In this
approximation for the interaction between miRNA and mRNA,
the fraction of the bound sites (h) is related to the free ligand
concentration (L) and the dissociation constant (Kd) by the logistic
equation:
A change in the ligand concentration between an experimental
state (LE) and the reference (LR) is related to a change in the
fraction of bound sites which can be expressed in terms of the
relative fold change . Hence, by the above expression:
To the extent that miRNAs function as negative regulators of
mRNA translation a positive log-odds ratio (larger bound fraction)
would imply a propensity for the target mRNA expression to be
reduced in the experimental state.
To synthesize the evidence from multiple DDCt values of
miRNAs targeting a specific gene we used the means and standard
errors from the MCMC simulations as input to random effects meta￾analyses. Such techniques, allow one to test the hypotheses that a
given sample of DDCq’s (‘‘treatment effects’’) follows a distribution
with a mean that departs from zero. In such a case, one would
expect the mRNA profile to deviate to a direction opposite to the

miRNA distributional mean (under-expressed miRNA implies
overexpression of the cognate mRNA and vice versa). Hence, by
considering the log-odds ratios for all putative miRNA-mRNA
pairs we estimated functional expression profiles for the miRNA
targets for post hoc exploration (enriched term analysis) in the
REACTOME [23] and Gene Ontology Project [24].
Results
Patients and Measurements
Baseline characteristics of patients included in this study are
shown in Table 1. In total we studied 40 patients with T1D: 10
who never developed diabetic renal disease (N) matched against 10
patients who went on to develop overt nephropathy (DN), 10
Figure 2. Results of Principal Component Analysis applied to all urine samples analyzed in this study. To present the results of the five
dimensional PCA, we utilized bivariate projections in which each component is plotted against all e.g. the second plot in the first row plots the first
principal component (PC1) against the second (PC2). Each individual urine sample is color and symbol coded according to the disease classification at
the time it was collected. N: patients without nephropathy, DN: patients with overt nephropathy, IMA(B): normoalbuminuric samples from patients
who had intermittent microalbuminuria, PMA(B): last normoalbuminuric samples from patients who had persistent albuminuria, IMA: micro￾albuminuric samples from patients who had intermittent micro-albuminuria, PMA: micro-albuminuric samples from patients who had persistent
microalbuminuria.

patients with intermittent microalbuminuria (IMA) matched
against 10 patients with persistent (PMA) microalbuminuria. In
general, patients were well matched within each of the two
comparison groups (IMA vs. PMA, N vs. DN) in terms of their
demographics and glycemic control (HBA1c). Roughly 50% of
patients with DN and an equivalent proportion of patients without
renal disease had at least one diabetic complication (most
commonly peripheral neuropathy). On the other hand, patients
at the microalbuminuria group were free of diabetic complications
at the time of urine collection. The majority of the patients in this
cohort were not on inhibitors of the angiotensin system (i.e.
Angiotensin Enzyme Inhibitors or Angiotensin Receptor Blockers),
with the exception of patients with overt nephropathy who were
receiving them (8/10 patients). Furthermore, these patients were
more likely to receive additional agents for blood pressure control,
paralleling the severity of their renal disease.
Due to the insufficient amount of RNA, we did not obtain good
quality mRNA measurement in 6 samples from 3 patient pairs in
the PMA sub-group and one urine sample from the IMA group.
Nevertheless, reproducibility of un-normalized Cq signals from

same symbol.

urine in the rest of the samples was high (Dataset S1 for un￾normalized Cq values). The quality of miRNA measurements was
assessed by using the detection probability of controls (Fig. S1) and
the reproducibility of un-normalized signals in replicates present in
the qPCR panels (Fig. S2). The detection probability of negative
(BLANK) and positive (UniSp6 and UniSp3) controls matched the
expected ratios (0%, 50% and 100% respectively). The corre￾sponding Cq values for the spiked controls were much less variable
than those of endogenous (miRNAs and small RNA) controls
suggested by the platform manufacturer without evidence of
substantial inter-plate variability. Hence fold changes were
computed relative to the UniSp3 RNA for all subsequent
comparisons.
Principal Component Analysis
A global view of the changes in urinary miRNA profiles
according to the clinical classification was performed with PCA
and the results for the first five principal components (PC) are
shown in Figure 2. Samples from Group A (DN vs. N) were
grouped together in some projections (e.g. see second plot in the
first row depicting PC1 v.s. PC2 ), while in other projections (PC3
vs. PC4 show in the last plot from the left, second row) samples
from both comparisons grouped together. Although patients with
DN appear to form a cluster distinct from those who never
developed nephropathy (projections PC2 v.s.PC3-5, in the second
row) there was no obvious clustering structure in the profiles of
patients with MA at either the baseline or the microalbuminuric
state).
To explore whether patients who had been matched into pairs
had similar microRNA profiles we plotted the results of the PCA
according to the pair identifier. These results which are shown in
Figure 3 show that patients within pairs have similar profiles (the
distance between points with the same plotting symbol appears
smaller than the distance of points from patients from different
pairs). Taken together these data suggest that there global changes
in the miRNA profile associated with the different stages of
diabetic nephropathy. Furthermore, the clustering of profiles with
patient pairs suggests that there are other determinants of
microRNA expression which correlate with the variables we used
to match patients during sample selection.
Comparisons between IMA and PMA
219 miRNAs yielded measurable signals in .75% of the 33
urine samples profiled for this comparison. We observed only a
few differences in the baseline samples. Relative to the IMA group,
patients with PMA demonstrate decreased miR-323b-5p levels
(Fold Change (FC) 0.13, 95% CrI: 0.03–0.67, p = 0.014) and
increased levels of: miR-122-5p (FC: 7.45, 95% CrI: 1.77–32.05,
p = 0.006), miR-429 (FC: 4.72, 95% CrI: 1.14–19.86,p = 0.034), at
baseline.
Table 2 shows the miRNAs with altered levels in the MA samples
relative to baseline. Appearance of micro-albuminuria is associat￾ed with decreased levels of miR-323b-5p and increased urine
concentration of miR-429. In Table 3 we summarize the incremental
FCs of specific miRNA levels in microalbuminuric samples
between PMA and IMA patients. Of note, two miRNAs in the
PMA patients (miR-373-5p and miR-323b-bp) exhibit concentra￾tion changes that are in the opposite direction relative to the
changes observed when both IMA/PMA patients manifest MA.
There were no further changes observed in the levels of the
remaining miRNAs found to be different in Table 2, while only a
small number of miRNAs appear to show incremental concen￾tration changes in the microalbuminuric urine from PMA patients.

summarize the miRNAs with altered expression in the urine of
patients with nephropathy. With the exception of miRNA-221-3p,
which decreased similar to the comparison of follow up and

altered expression in any of the previous comparisons. Finally,
there was a trend for miR-589 and miR-323b-5p to be increased
in the urine of patients with overt nephropathy. The correspond￾ing FCs were 2.99, (95% CrI: 0.81–9.95, p = 0.087) and 4.45,
(95% CrI: 090–29.1, p = 0.08).
miRNA Target Functional Profiling
Figure 4 summarizes the number of predicted mRNA targets
of the differentially expressed miRNAs in diabetic urine based on
the prediction databases. Analysis of enriched terms in REAC￾TOME (Table 5) suggest that the predicted miRNA targets map to
a distinct pathways involving growth factor signaling, apoptosis,
immunity, substrate metabolism, transmembrane transport and
certain non-kidney related terms. Furthermore, the identified
pathways overlapped considerably between the comparisons of
patients with overt nephropathy and normals, and follow-up v.s.
baseline samples from MA patients. In the comparisons within
baseline and follow-up MA samples we found only a few (,80)
targets mapping to annotated REACTOME pathways, thus

Discussion
In this paper we report the changes of urinary miRNA spectrum
in T1D patients with different stages of albuminuria and
nephropathy. We found concentration changes on specific
miRNAs that may involve in specific pathways known to be
altered in various forms of renal diseases. Since the kidney is the
most likely source of these urinary miRNAs, we suggest that these
miRNAs may be of biological and clinical significance in T1D.
A global Principal Component Analysis viewpoint of the
microRNA profiles analyzed in this report suggests that there
are some differences in the expression of urinary microRNA which
appear to follow the clinical classification of patients and urinary
samples with respect to albumin excretion. The apparent
clustering of profiles from patients who had been matched into
pairs, suggests that there are other factors affecting urinary
microRNA besides the clinical classification of disease. Such
factors are likely related to the variables we used in patient
matching e.g. age, sex, and duration of disease and level of
glycemic control. This observation justifies post-hoc our decision
to explore specific microRNA signatures across the spectrum of
clinical classification of patients and samples using a matched case
control design.
Our matched case-control Bayesian analyses highlight a set of
27 differentially regulated miRNAs across different clinical stages
of diabetic renal disease. Previous work using experimental,
clinical chemistry or biopsy samples has demonstrated differential
expression of many of these miRNAs in a variety of renal
conditions: hypertensive nephrosclerosis (with an increase of miR-429
levels in human renal biopsies [25]), mouse models of chronic
renal injury (increased miR-214 levels [26]) and renal senescence [27]
(increased miR-335 levels). Other miRNAs have also been
implicated in immunologically mediated renal diseases such as
lupus nephritis(miR-429 [28], miR-638,miR-373-5p and miR-92b￾5p [29]), IgA nephropathy (miR-429 correlating with the level of
proteinuria and renal function [30]), and acute T cell rejection of renal
allografts (decreased miR-323-5p, miR-638/miR-373-5p [31]).
Based on miRNA target prediction databases, miRNAs showing
concentration changes in diabetic urine may regulate genes that
play key roles in renal physiology and pathophysiology: fibronectin a
key component of the extracellular matrix that accumulates in
diabetic nephropathy [32] (miR-17-5p [33] which is also regulated
in senescence models of renal proximal tubule epithelial cells [34]),
PKD2 responsible for polycystic kidney disease (miR-17-5p
[35,36]), Sod2, superoxide dismutase, a mitochondrial antioxidant
enzyme in renal mesangial cells(miR-335 [27]), Claudin-16 a key
component of the tight junction in the thick ascending limb (has￾miR-323b-5p [37]), the tumor suppressor protein PTEN which is
decreased in DN [38] (and is directly regulated by miR-221-3p/
222-3p [39] in heterologous systems), Abcg2 (a stem cell marker
[40] regulated by miR-520h [41]), Vhl (a tumor suppressor gene
involved in renal tumours targeted by miR-92a [42]). Hence, prior
research highlights a kidney related role for a number of the
miRNAs found to be differentially expressed in our analyses,
suggesting that these miRNAs may be important mediators of
renal damage rather than simple biomarkers of an underlying
injury process without pathobiological significance.
In addition, intriguing connections in heterologous systems have
been reported for other miRNAs highlighted in this report: miR￾221-3p/222-3p (neovascularization and vascular neointimal hy￾perplasia [43], Advanced Glycosylation End product mediated
vascular damage [44]), miR-424 (regulating angiogenesis in the
setting of hypoxia by targeting Cul2 [45] as well as Vegfr2 and Fgfr1
[46]). Many of these conditions have been recognized as clinically
important vascular complications of diabetes, often presenting
simultaneously with the development of nephropathy; hence one
may conjecture that the spectrum of urine miRNAs may allow one
to stratify the risk of diabetic patients for developing extrarenal
complications.
With the samples used in this study, we could not verify the
association of miR-192 with DN. Higher miR-192 levels have
been previously linked to renal damage in the streptozocin (T1D)
and the db/db (T2D) mouse nephropathy models [47] through
TGFb –mediated production of miR-192 by mesangial cells. More
recent evidence points towards a positive feedback loop for TGFb
production involving miR-192 and miR-200b/c in mesangial cells
[48]. On the other hand, decreased miR-192 was noted in biopsy
specimens of patients with advanced diabetic nephropathy, while
miR-192 expression was positively correlated with EGFR and
negatively correlated with the degree of fibrosis suggesting a
protective role for miR-192 [49]. In that report, miR-192
expression was predominantly localized to tubular epithelial cells
and TGF exposure was found to decrease both miR-192 and E￾cadherin mRNA levels. Hence it appears that miR-192 may be

regulated differently in different renal cell populations, possibly in
a DN stage specific manner. This hypothesis is supported by
recent evidence which failed to detect alterations in miR-192
expression in microdissected glomeruli of Munich Wistar Fromter
rat model of spontaneous develop diabetic nephropathy [50].
Since the miRNAs in the urine originate from diverse cellular
sources in the kidney, the lack of a differential expression of miR￾192 in this report may reflect the cancelation of two diverging
(positive in mesangial, negative in tubular epithelial cells) signals
leading to an overall ‘‘null’’ effect.
Most of the identified miRNAs exhibited changes in one disease
state rather than showing a quantitative trend of increasing or
decreasing expression paralleling the severity of albuminuria. To
understand this pattern we examined the predicted targets of these
miRNAs and the corresponding pathways using structured
vocabularies for biological annotation. Despite the disparate
identity of the miRNAs, the mRNAs that are predicted to be
targeted by them map to pathways that have been previously
shown to be pathophysiologically relevant to DN: TGF (the
prototypical ‘‘renal-fibrosis’’ culprit [51]), PDGF (associated with
mesangial proliferation and fibrosis [52]) and FGF (clinical
predictor of progression in diabetic nephropathy [53]).
Our analyses suggest the involvement of NGF (Nerve Growth
Factor, a prototypical Central Nervous System trophic molecule)
in diabetic nephropathy. This may lead to a new direction toward
the development of T1D associated nephropathy since so far the
renal expression of NGF has been thought to reflect the level of
glycemic control [54]. Nevertheless, NGF has been recently shown
to be involved in tissue repair and fibrosis in liver, skin and lung
[55], and its involvement in non-diabetic renal disease has been
noted in a number of biopsy studies over the last 30 years [56], so
that the association of NGF with diabetic nephropathy appears
plausible.
Growth Factor as well as other pathways (e.g. cell-cell and cell￾matrix) are targeted from the microalbuminuric stage, while the
number of targeted genes in these pathways increased at the overt
nephropathy stage. Hence an ‘‘exposure-response’’ relation
appears at the target (mRNA) rather than the regulator (miRNA)
level. This relation stems from the overlapping, combinatorial,
binding specificities of miRNAs to their mRNA targets so that the
same pathways may be targeted by rather different sets of miRNAs
depending on the prevailing cellular context.
An interesting aspect of the targets associated with the miRNAs
identified in this study is the lack of an overwhelming association
between growth factor transduction pathways and the tempo of
MA. Rather, an association with tissue damage, innate immunity,
metabolic pathway and developmental program (re)-activation was
shown, suggesting that recurrent bouts of metabolic or free
oxidative stress may account for the persistency and possibly the
progression of MA to overt nephropathy. To the extent that these
statistically determined patterns are verified experimentally,
further development of miRNA target identification may have
potential clinical implications as an early diagnostic test for
diabetic renal disease or to select and or monitor response to
emerging therapies for diabetic renal disease; e.g. pentoxifylline
[57], pirfenidone [58] and bardoxolone [59] which interfere with
pathways implicated in our analyses.
The findings of our study should be interpreted in light of a
number of limitations. First, we analyzed urine samples from an
era in which current therapies for diabetic nephropathy (angio￾tensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor
blockers) were not widely used early in the disease process. Hence
most of the patients with MA were not on ACEi/ARB inhibition
even though evidence from randomized trials suggest that these
agents delay the appearance of microalbuminuria [60,61]. On the
other hand, most patients with overt nephropathy were on such
agents with persistence of their macroalbuminuric state. Hence,
our findings reflect the natural urinary miRNA phenotype of the
early stages of diabetic nephropathy, the failing treatment one in
advance disease and are not proposed to be representative of
patients undergoing optimal treatment with these agents. Although
this would appear to represent a major limitation of this study, the
data presented here are rather unique in that they provide
information on both untreated patients as well as those failing
therapy, allowing some insight into the pathways that underline
treatment resistance to the current treatment paradigm. This is
exemplified by miR-324-3p which was apparently increased in
patients with PMA not receiving an ACEi in accordance with
recent animal data suggesting that this miRNA is a promoter of
renal fibrosis and is downregulated by ACEi inhibition. At the
same time, our patients with overt nephropathy showed no
tendency of this miRNA to change relative to controls (FC was
1.06 in this dataset) suggesting that some of the discordance in
miRNA profiles may be the result of therapies preferentially
affecting certain miRNA species but not others. Since this
investigation never intended to delineate treatment induced
changes in urine miRNA profiles, future studies should examine
both responders and non-responders at different points in time to
determine miRNA correlates of therapeutic success and failure.
Second, while our experience is no different from previous studies
examining urine miRNA profiles in renal transplantation [31,62],
systemic lupus [28] and chronic kidney disease [63], many of the
urinary miRNA signals in this analysis were of low magnitude
requiring a large number of PCR cycles and careful optimization
of qPCR conditions [64] to be detected. Third, we inferred the
renal origin of urine miRNAs yet the possibility that the latter
derive from other sources such as plasma cannot be ruled out. As
the approximate molecular weight of miRNAs (,6.2–7.2 kDa) is
below the permselectivity threshold of the glomerular filtration
barrier (, 60 kDa) it is possible that a substantial portion of
circulating plasma miRNAs is ultrafiltered in the urine. Never￾theless, a recent study in chronic kidney disease found a
dissociation between plasma and urine miRNA spectrum [63]
suggesting a substantial non-plasma source for urine miRNA. To
resolve these issues, simultaneous profiling of plasma and urine
should be undertaken, a task which was not possible in this report
due to the unavailability of plasma samples. Fourth, some of the
miRNAs identified as differentially regulated have been found to
play a role in non-diabetic renal disease, so that the reported
associations may lack disease specificity. We tried to overcome this
limitation by combining the changes in miRNA concentrations
with the simultaneous predictions of miRNA targets. Most of the
pathways identified have been linked to the development of
diabetic nephropathy among different animal models and clinical
studies which suggests the combination of using specific miRNA
levels and its interacting mRNA targets as a general approach to
enhance interpretability and specificity of miRNA profiles.
Furthermore, the use of panels of markers will be much more
informative and can potentially distinguish pathologies that
produce overlapping sets of markers.
In summary, a set of 27 differentially miRNAs were identified in
matched urine samples from T1D patients with different stages of
diabetic nephropathy, whose renal outcomes had been ascertained
after prolonged follow up. These miRNAs map to pathways of
known relevance to the development of diabetic renal disease,
strongly suggesting the renal source of the miRNAs. Our results
suggest that a number of miRNAs in urine may serve not only as
molecular signatures of distinct clinical phenotypes in diabetic

nephropathy but also as early indicators of alterations in specific
biological processes in the kidney which can be of importance in
individualizing emergent therapies for diabetic kidney disease.
Further studies are needed to extend these observations in the
setting of T2D and clarify the potential utility of these miRNAs in
early diagnosis, risk stratification for progression and treatment
selection or monitoring.
