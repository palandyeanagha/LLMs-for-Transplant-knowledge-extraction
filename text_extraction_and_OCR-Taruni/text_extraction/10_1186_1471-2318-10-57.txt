Abstract
Background: A frailty paradigm would be useful in primary care to identify older people at risk, but appropriate
metrics at that level are lacking. We created and validated a simple instrument for frailty screening in Europeans
aged ≥50. Our study is based on the first wave of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE,
http://www.share-project.org), a large population-based survey conducted in 2004-2005 in twelve European
countries.
Methods: Subjects: SHARE Wave 1 respondents (17,304 females and 13,811 males). Measures: five SHARE variables
approximating Fried’s frailty definition. Analyses (for each gender): 1) estimation of a discreet factor (DFactor) model
based on the frailty variables using LatentGOLD®. A single DFactor with three ordered levels or latent classes (i.e.
non-frail, pre-frail and frail) was modelled; 2) the latent classes were characterised against a biopsychosocial range
of Wave 1 variables; 3) the prospective mortality risk (unadjusted and age-adjusted) for each frailty class was
established on those subjects with known mortality status at Wave 2 (2007-2008) (11,384 females and 9,163 males);
4) two web-based calculators were created for easy retrieval of a subject’s frailty class given any five measurements.
Results: Females: the DFactor model included 15,578 cases (standard R2 = 0.61). All five frailty indicators
discriminated well (p < 0.001) between the three classes: non-frail (N = 10,420; 66.9%), pre-frail (N = 4,025; 25.8%),
and frail (N = 1,133; 7.3%). Relative to the non-frail class, the age-adjusted Odds Ratio (with 95% Confidence
Interval) for mortality at Wave 2 was 2.1 (1.4 - 3.0) in the pre-frail and 4.8 (3.1 - 7.4) in the frail. Males: 12,783 cases
(standard R2 = 0.61, all frailty indicators had p < 0.001): non-frail (N = 10,517; 82.3%), pre-frail (N = 1,871; 14.6%), and
frail (N = 395; 3.1%); age-adjusted OR (95% CI) for mortality: 3.0 (2.3 - 4.0) in the pre-frail, 6.9 (4.7 - 10.2) in the frail.
Conclusions: The SHARE Frailty Instrument has sufficient construct and predictive validity, and is readily and freely
accessible via web calculators. To our knowledge, SHARE-FI represents the first European research effort towards a
common frailty language at the community level.
Background
Frailty is an emerging geriatric syndrome [1], and its
associations include falls, disability, morbidity, mortality
and excess healthcare costs from consultations, poly￾pharmacy, hospitalisations and institutionalisations [2-5].
Frailty confers loss of independence, vulnerability and
impairs the quality of life and psychological well-being
of many older people; it also poses an enormous chal￾lenge on families, carers and other structures of social
care and social support. The prevalence of frailty in
community-dwelling older Europeans (65 years and
older) varies between 5.8% and 27.3%; in addition,
between 34.6% and 50.9% are classified as ‘pre-frail’ [6].
In the face of the rapid population ageing occurring in
Western societies, frailty is set to reach epidemic pro￾portions over the next few decades.
Frailty is an entity recognised by clinicians, with multi￾ple manifestations and with no single symptom being
sufficient or essential in its presentation [7]. In part due
to its syndromic nature, and despite considerable
research efforts in the field, an operational definition of
frailty that meets international consensus is still lacking

[8-13]. Defining frailty requires a complex systems
approach [2] and, in general, it is accepted that a good
definition should not only capture the biological, but
also the psychosocial correlates of frailty [14]. In addi￾tion, it has been suggested that frailty could have a gen￾dered dimension and manifest differently in males and
females [15].
Numerous frailty definitions and assessment tools
have been developed in clinical practice and research,
and this has been the focus of many reviews and com￾parative studies [3,16-20]. In particular, Fried et al.’s
frailty phenotype [21,22] has achieved international
reputation. The method has been extensively validated
in the research literature [23-25]; however, a criticism is
that it is not readily applicable in routine primary care
practice.
The main advantage of Fried’s method is that it
requires the measurement of only five variables, namely
weight loss, exhaustion, grip strength, walking speed and
physical activity [21]. Whilst this is affordable from a
primary care point of view, the problem arises with the
construction of the measure. In Fried’s definition, frailty
is defined in terms of three categories, each of which is
defined by the sum of the number of individual criteria
present (0: non-frail, 1 or 2: pre-frail, and 3, 4 or 5:
frail). The dichotomisation of individual criteria that are
measured on a continuous scale (i.e. grip strength, walk￾ing speed and physical activity) is done retrospectively
according to the lowest twentieth percentile rule, and
there are further stratifications. This requires consider￾able statistical expertise and also a reference sample,
both of which are not always available to primary care
practitioners.
With the ageing of the population in Western societies
and the rising costs of health and social care, many coun￾tries are refocusing health policy on health promotion
and disability prevention among older people. It has been
argued that efforts aimed at identifying at-risk groups of
older people in order to provide early intervention and/
or multidisciplinary case management should be done at
the level of general practice via adoption of a clinical
paradigm based on the concept of frailty, which fits well
with the biopsychosocial model of primary care [26].
However, this ideal has exposed the lack of frailty metrics
that are appropriate for primary care. Indeed, family phy￾sicians and community practitioners are still in need of
easy instruments for frailty [27].
Recently, Santos-Eggimann et al. employed an
approach to Fried’s method in the first wave of the Sur￾vey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe
(SHARE), in order to establish the prevalence of frailty
in middle-aged and older community-dwelling Eur￾opeans living in ten countries [6]. Since SHARE did not
collect Fried’s criteria according to their original
definition, Santos-Eggimann et al. selected the five
SHARE variables that in their view were the closest to
Fried’s variables. Although their selection was not with￾out significant departures from Fried’s theoretical
model, their effort represented the first-time attempt to
operationalise Fried’s frailty phenotype in a very large
European population-based sample.
Building upon Santos-Eggimann et al.’s work, and
using methodology previously described by Bandeen￾Roche et al. on Fried’s original variables [22], the aims
of this study were to assess whether those five SHARE
variables approaching Fried’s frailty phenotype had
internal validity on their own and could be statistically
summarised in a single factor with three underlying
latent classes (i.e. non-frail, pre-frail and frail), with
appropriate biopsychosocial correlates and predictive
validity.
Rather than replicating Fried’s paradigm, our aim was
to offer a valid related alternative to it in the European
context, whist taking advantage of the unparalleled data
resource made available by SHARE. The ultimate goal
was to provide European community practitioners with
a simple and valid instrument that offers a pre-calcu￾lated, population-representative and gender-specific
frailty class, once the five measurements are entered.
The SHARE Frailty Instrument (SHARE-FI) is intended
to facilitate the rapid assessment of frailty in primary
care and enhance the communication between the var￾ious agencies managing middle-aged and older people in
the community.
Methods
An overview of the validation strategy is presented in
Figure 1.
Subjects
17,304 females and 13,811 males included in the first
wave of the Survey of Health, Aging and Retirement in
Europe (SHARE, release 2.3.0 of November 13th, 2009),
corresponding to nationally representative samples of
12 European countries (Austria, Germany, Sweden,
Netherlands, Spain, Italy, France, Denmark, Greece,
Switzerland, Belgium and Israel).
SHARE aimed at extracting from each country prob￾ability samples that would allow inferring from the sam￾ple to the finite population of Europeans aged 50 and
over. The target population of individuals was defined as
all individuals born in 1954 or earlier, speaking the offi￾cial language of the country and not living abroad or in
an institution such as a prison (or institution for older
people) during the duration of the field work, and their
spouses/partners independent of age [28]. For the total
pooled sample (N = 31,115), country-specific individual
response rates ranged between 73.7% and 93.3%, with

an average of 85.3% (http://www.share-project.org/t3/
share/index.php?id=97, last accessed: August 18th, 2010).
Wave 1 data were collected between 2004 and 2006.
The mean age (standard deviation) of the females was
63.6 (11.1), and that of males was 64.1 (9.9). Complete
data for assessing frailty according to the approach by
Santos-Eggimann et al. [6] were available for 15,578
females and 12,783 males.
For the prospective validation of SHARE-FI, we used a
subset of Wave 1 subjects (11,384 females and 9,163
males) for whom mortality data at Wave 2 (2006 - 2007)
were available. Since a considerable proportion (34%) of
baseline subjects had missing information on mortality
and SHARE could not ascertain the causes of non￾response for all respondents [29], we compared (for each
gender) subjects with mortality data available vs. unavail￾able, to assess the representativity of the subsamples used
for the prospective validation. In addition, we imputed
missing mortality data and conducted a sensitivity analy￾sis to assess the impact of missing mortality data on the
mortality prediction of SHARE-FI. The mean follow up
period between Wave 1 and Wave 2 was 2.4 years.
Frailty definition
All questionnaires, full variable definitions and original
variable codes can be found in the SHARE methodology
book, which is available online [30].
For the frailty definition, we used the SHARE variables
previously selected by Santos-Eggimann et al. [6]:
• Exhaustion was identified as a positive response to
the question: “In the last month, have you had too little
energy to do the things you wanted to do?”. A positive
answer (Yes) was re-coded as 1, and No was re-coded
as 0.
• The weight loss criterion was fulfilled by reporting a
“Diminution in desire for food” in response to the ques￾tion: “What has your appetite been like?” or, in the case
of a non-specific or uncodeable response to this ques￾tion, by responding “Less” to the question: “So, have you
been eating more or less than usual?”. The presence of
the criterion was coded as 1 and its absence as 0.
• Weakness was assessed by handgrip strength (Kg)
using a dynamometer. Two consecutive measurements
were taken from the left and right hands. The highest of
the four was selected. This variable was kept continuous.
• Slowness was defined as a positive answer to either
of the following two items: “Because of a health pro￾blem, do you have difficulty [expected to last more than
3 months] walking 100 metres?” or “... climbing one
flight of stairs without resting?”. One or two positive
answers received the score of 1, and two negative
answers received the score of 0.
• The low activity criterion was assessed by the ques￾tion: “How often do you engage in activities that require

a low or moderate level of energy such as gardening,
cleaning the car, or doing a walk?”. This variable was
kept ordinal: 1 = “More than once a week”;2= “Once a
week”; 3 = One to three times a month” and 4 =
“Hardly ever or never”.
We agree with Santos-Eggimann et al. [6] that, among
all the items available in SHARE for the total sample,
the above choice of variables is the closest possible vis￾à-vis the original variables in Fried’s phenotype [21].
However, we acknowledge two significant departures
from Fried’s theoretical framework, namely as regards
‘weight loss’ (replaced by appetite) and ‘slowness’ (mea￾sured by questions on functional limitation). Therefore,
the aim was not to validate SHARE-FI vis-à-vis Fried’s
phenotype, but to establish the validity of SHARE-FI on
its own, whilst acknowledging its sources.
Measures for cross-sectional correlations

• Age (years). It was obtained by subtracting the year
of birth from 2004.
• Years of education.
Physical domain
• Self-rated health: excellent (1), very good (2), good
(3), fair (4), or poor (5).
• Number of chronic diseases: calculated as the sum
of affirmative self-reports to the following conditions
(if diagnosed by a doctor): 1. Heart attack or myo￾cardial infarction or coronary thrombosis or any
other heart problem including congestive heart fail￾ure; 2. High blood pressure or hypertension; 3. High
blood cholesterol; 4. Stroke or cerebral vascular dis￾ease; 5. Diabetes or high blood sugar; 6. Chronic
lung disease such as chronic bronchitis or emphy￾sema; 7. Asthma; 8. Arthritis, including osteoarthri￾tis, or rheumatism; 9. Osteoporosis; 10. Cancer or
malignant tumour, including leukaemia or lym￾phoma, but excluding minor skin cancers; 11. Sto￾mach or duodenal ulcer, peptic ulcer; 12. Parkinson
disease; 13. Cataracts; 14. Hip fracture or femoral
fracture; 15. Other fractures; 16. Alzheimer’s disease,
dementia or senility; 17. Benign tumour and 18.
Other conditions.
• Number of medical symptoms present for at least
the past six months.
• Number of contacts with a medical doctor in the
past 12 months.
• Admitted to hospital in the past 12 months (yes or
no).
Functional domain
• Number of limitations with activities of daily living.
• Number of limitations with instrumental activities
of daily living.
• Received home care for personal or nursing care in
the last 12 months: yes or no.
• Received home care for domestic tasks in the last
12 months: yes or no.
Psychological and cognitive domains
• EURO-D depression scale [31].
• Verbal fluency test score: maximum number of dif￾ferent animals that the respondent is able to name
in 60 seconds.
• Delayed word recall: maximum number of words
(out of a list of 10) that the respondent is able to
recall after an initial recall followed by the verbal
fluency and numeracy tests.
Mortality measures (for prospective validation)
The release 2.3.0 of Wave 1 contains a variable that
informs whether Wave 1 respondents were still alive in
Wave 2, deceased between Wave 1 and Wave 2, or with
mortality information unavailable. Information was
available for 11,384 females and 9,163 males (66% of the
baseline sample).
Statistical analyses
Univariate descriptives
Individual variable descriptives were given as mean and
standard deviation (SD) or proportion (percentage) as
appropriate.
Level of significance
It was set at 0.01 throughout.
Estimation of a discreet factor (DFactor) model
For each gender, a DFactor model was estimated based
on the five SHARE frailty variables using the Latent￾GOLD® package (version 4.5.0) http://www.statisticalin￾novations.com. A single DFactor with three ordered
levels or latent classes (non-frail, pre-frail and frail) was
requested. To assess the extent to which the frailty vari￾ables discriminated between the classes independently of
age, each DFactor model was repeated with age as
covariate.
In the context of this study, DFactor analysis is prefer￾able to traditional Factor Analysis (FA) because in DFac￾tor analysis the observed variables may be of mixed
scale types including nominal (i.e. exhaustion, weight
loss and slowness), ordinal (i.e. low activity) and continu￾ous (i.e. weakness). The latent variables are not continu￾ous but discrete, in our case containing 3 ordered
categories (levels). Importantly, in DFactor analysis the
model is not linear.
For each gender, the non age-adjusted DFactor model
classification was saved in SPSS 16.0 format and merged
with SHARE Wave 1 data to allow for correlations
between the classes and various biopsychosocial vari￾ables, as well as with the mortality at Wave 2 variable.

Correlations of the latent classes against SHARE Wave 1
variables
The two-tailed Spearman’s rank correlation (rho) coeffi￾cient was used to correlate the (ordinal) latent class
membership variable against continuous and ordinal
variables; the SPSS partial correlations procedure was
used to control for the effects of age in these correla￾tions. The Chi-squared for trend was used to test the
association between the latent class membership variable
and dichotomous variables; to control for the effects of
age, ordinal regression (with latent class as dependent
variable) was used.
Prospective validation of the DFactor
Binary logistic regression was conducted to assess
whether the DFactor classes at Wave 1 significantly pre￾dicted whether or not a subject was dead by Wave 2. In
the model, the latent class membership variable was
entered as a categorical predictor, using the non-frail
class as reference category, and simple contrasts were
requested. The dependent variable (i.e. dead at Wave 2,
coded 0 = no and 1 = yes) included non-missing data
only. The odds ratio (OR) for mortality was indicated by
the Exp(B) statistic in the binary logistic regression
model. Ninety-five percent confidence intervals for ORs
were requested. Age-adjusted models were also
computed.
Sensitivity analysis for the prospective validation
For each gender, comparisons between mortality-avail￾able and mortality-unavailable groups were conducted
with the Chi-squared test (for dichotomous variables) or
the Mann-Whitney U test (for continuous or ordinal
variables).
For the sensitivity analysis, the imputation of missing
mortality data was conducted, for each gender and
frailty class, as follows: we counted the number of cases
who were not lost to follow up (B), and then we estab￾lished the number cases who died (A). The unadjusted
mortality rate (A/B%) was defined as the expected mor￾tality rate for the missing cases and was randomly
applied to them. The rest of the missing cases were
coded as alive.
Construction of the SHARE-FI calculators
For each gender, this involved the following steps: 1) use
of the individual variable loadings on the DFactor to
derivate a linear formula for the calculation of the pre￾dicted DFactor score; 2) use of SPSS curve estimation
procedures to understand the non-linear relationship
between predicted and empirical DFactor scores; 3)
identification of the two latent class cut-off scores on
the non-linear fitted curve, and 4) incorporation of the
predicted DFactor score formula and class cut-off values
into a web-based interface that, following entry of the
five frailty measurements, automatically calculates the
score and adjudicates its class.
The formula for the predicted DFactor score is
obtained by considering the coefficients of the individual
variables on the DFactor (as shown in LatentGOLD® out￾put). In order to construct the raw score, the tool uses a
linear combination of the standardised variables that
have been entered in the calculator. The raw frailty score
for a new individual, i, can be expressed as follows:
DFactor score(i) z w (i) z w (i) z w (i)
z
=+ + fat fat loss loss grip grip
+ fdiff fdiff act act w (i) z w (i), +
where FAT is fatigue, LOSS is loss of appetite, GRIP is
grip strength, FDIFF is functional difficulties and ACT is
physical activity, as defined in the above frailty defini￾tion. The value zfat(i) represents the standardised score
on the fatigue measure for the individual i, and similarly
for the other standardised scores. The wfat is the weight￾ing associated with that measure on the DFactor and is
obtained from the LatentGOLD® output.
Once the predicted DFactor score formula and class
cut-off values were obtained, an interface was designed
using Microsoft Office Excel 2007. The spreadsheet was
then converted to a webpage using the commercially
available SpreadsheetConverter to HTML/JavaScript®
version 4.5.2 (Framtidsforum I & M AB, Uppsala
Sweden, http://www.spreadsheetconverter.com).
Results
Table 1 summarises the SHARE-FI validation results.
Estimation of the DFactor models
DFactor for females
The DFactor model included 15,578 cases. Fifteen para￾meters were estimated, standard R2 = 0.61, entropy R2 =
0.43. All five frailty indicators discriminated well (p <
0.001) between the three classes: non-frail (N = 10,420;
66.9%), pre-frail (N = 4,025; 25.8%), and frail (N = 1,133;
7.3%). The DFactor loadings (with R2 representing the
communality of the indicator) were:
• Fatigue = 0.4088 (R2 = 0.1671)
• Loss of appetite = 0.3325 (R2 = 0.1246)
• Grip strength = -0.4910 (R2 = 0.2411)
• Functional difficulties = 0.6012 (R2 = 0.4109)
• Physical activity = 0.4818 (R2 = 0.2445)
The conditional probabilities (given class membership)
for the non-continuous indicators and the mean grip
strength for each latent class are shown in Table 1.
Entering age as a covariate in the DFactor model did
not significantly change the results (standard R2 = 0.67,
entropy R2 = 0.52, all indicators with p < 0.001). The
age-adjusted R2 communalities were: Fatigue = 0.1057,
Loss of appetite = 0.0818, Grip strength = 0.4159, Func￾tional difficulties = 0.3444 and Physical activity =
0.1731.

DFactor for males
The DFactor model included 12,783 cases. Fifteen para￾meters were estimated, standard R2 = 0.61, entropy R2 =
0.47. All five frailty indicators discriminated well (p <
0.001) between the three classes: non-frail (N = 10,517;
82.3%), pre-frail (N = 1,871; 14.6%), and frail (N = 395;
3.1%). The DFactor loadings were:
• Fatigue = 0.3762 (R2 = 0.1415)
• Loss of appetite = 0.3130 (R2 = 0.1133)
• Grip strength = -0.4653 (R2 = 0.2165)
• Functional difficulties = 0.6146 (R2 = 0.4075)
• Physical activity = 0.4680 (R2 = 0.2244)
The conditional probabilities (given class membership)
for the non-continuous indicators and the mean grip
strength for each latent class are shown in Table 1.
Entering age as a covariate in the DFactor model did
not significantly change the results (standard R2 = 0.70,
entropy R2 = 0.57, all indicators with p < 0.001). The
age-adjusted R2 communalities were: Fatigue = 0.0627,
Loss of appetite = 0.0501, Grip strength = 0.5342, Func￾tional difficulties = 0.2206 and Physical activity =
0.0874.
Bivariate correlations
As Table 1 shows, all the correlations (unadjusted and
age-adjusted) were statistically significant (p < 0.001),
and of moderate effect size [32]. For example, in
females, the unadjusted/age-adjusted correlation coeffi￾cients were: 0.46/0.41 for self-rated health, 0.38/0.32 for
chronic diseases, 0.40/0.40 for symptoms, 0.32/0.28 for
visits to the doctor, 0.35/0.34 for ADL limitations, 0.42/
0.41 for IADL limitations, and 0.45/0.48 for EURO-D.
In males, the unadjusted/age-adjusted correlation
coefficients were: 0.40/0.37 for self-rated health, 0.28/
0.24 for chronic diseases, 0.32/0.36 for symptoms, 0.28/
0.26 for visits to the doctor, 0.31/0.36 for ADL limita￾tions, 0.39/0.41 for IADL limitations, and 0.36/0.44 for
EURO-D.
Predictive validity of SHARE-FI
Table 1 shows, for females and males, the unadjusted
and age-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for mortality at
Wave 2 (with 95% confidence intervals, CIs) given the
frailty class in Wave 1.
In females, relative to the non-frail class, the unad￾justed OR was 3.7 (2.5-5.3) in the pre-frail and 14.2
(9.7-20.8) in the frail. The age-adjusted OR was 2.1
(1.4 - 3.0) in the pre-frail and 4.8 (3.1 - 7.4) in the frail.
In males, relative to the non-frail class, the unadjusted
OR was 4.8 (3.7 - 6.2) in the pre-frail and 14.6 (10.3 -
20.7) in the frail. The age-adjusted OR was 3.0 (2.3 -
4.0) in the pre-frail and 6.9 (4.7 - 10.2) in the frail.
Tables 2 and 3 show the comparisons between mor￾tality-available and mortality-unavailable subgroups.
In females, the subgroup with missing mortality data
(N = 5,920) had significantly higher levels of frailty in
all but one (i.e. exhaustion) frailty parameters; they
were more likely to be pre-frail and frail and less likely
to be non-frail; they had worse self-rated health, higher
number of contacts with the doctor in the past year,
more limitations with IADLs and a worse cognitive
profile (Table 2).
In males, the subgroup with missing mortality data
(N = 4,648) had significantly higher levels of frailty in all
frailty parameters; they were more likely to be pre-frail
and frail and less likely to be non-frail; they had worse
self-rated health, higher number of contacts with the
doctor in the past year, more hospital admissions in the
last year, more limitations with ADLs and IADLs, and a
worse psychological and cognitive profile (Table 3).
Sensitivity analysis
Table 4 shows the cross-tabulation for the imputation of
missing mortality status, by frailty class and gender.
Based on this, for females and males, we recalculated
the unadjusted and age-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for
mortality at Wave 2 (with 95% confidence intervals, CIs)
given the frailty class in Wave 1:
In females, relative to the non-frail class, the unad￾justed OR was 3.7 (2.7 - 5.0) in the pre-frail and 14.1
(10.4 - 19.2) in the frail. The age-adjusted OR was 2.5
(1.9 - 3.5) in the pre-frail and 6.9 (4.9 - 9.7) in the frail.
In males, relative to the non-frail class, the unadjusted
OR was 4.8 (3.9 - 5.9) in the pre-frail and 14.4 (11.0 -
18.9) in the frail. The age-adjusted OR was 3.8 (3.1 -
4.8) in the pre-frail and 10.0 (7.4 - 13.4) in the frail.
Frailty calculators
Using the procedure described above, two SHARE-FI
calculators (one for females and one for males) were
produced and converted to HTML format. The calcula￾tors are attached to this manuscript as Additional file 1
(females) and Additional file 2 (males).

latent class membership variable revealed that the empiri￾cal cut-offs for the frailty classes were 0.25 and 0.75. Extra￾polation of these cut-offs to the predicted DFS provided
the following cut-offs for the SHARE-FI calculators:

• If predicted DFS < 2.1301121973, PRE-FRAIL
• If predicted DFS < 6, FRAIL

• If predicted DFS < 3.0052612772, PRE-FRAIL
• If predicted DFS < 7, FRAIL
Discussion
The aim of this study was to provide European commu￾nity practitioners with a valid and simple tool to mea￾sure the level of frailty in individuals aged ≥50 years
given five quick measurements, leading to the obtention
of a frailty class relative to a large population-based
sample (Wave 1 of SHARE).
In this study, a gendered approach to frailty was
adopted and psychosocial correlates of frailty were
explored. Two frailty calculators, one for males and one
for females, were created and the correlations of the
frailty classes against a range of SHARE variables were
presented to demonstrate the concurrent criterion valid￾ity of SHARE-FI. We also explored the prospective

validity of SHARE-FI as a predictor of mortality over a
mean follow up of 2.4 years.
The frailty definition used in this study is related (but
not equivalent) to the one by Fried et al. [21], and was
first used by Santos-Eggimann et al. [6]. Our aim was
not to compare the construct validity of this definition
vis-à-vis Fried’s construct, but to offer a valid related
alternative to it in the European context, whist taking
advantage of the unparalleled data resource made avail￾able by SHARE.
Both in females and males, SHARE-FI was proven to
conform to a discreet, 3-level ordinal latent construct
with decreasing population prevalence. The overall pre￾valence of pre-frailty was 25.8% in females and 14.6% in

males; and the prevalence of frailty was 7.3% in females
and 3.1% in males. This is highly consistent with the ori￾ginal Cardiovascular Health Study by Fried et al. [21],
which showed a prevalence of frailty in the original
cohort (1989-1990) of 7.3% in females and 4.9% in males.
In addition to its ability to predict mortality, SHARE￾FI had concurrent criterion validity against a range of
measures, as shown by the medium-sized correlations
with indices of both subjective (self-rated) and objective
(e.g. number of chronic diseases) health, and also with
health care utilisation (e.g. number of contacts with a
doctor). This would make SHARE-FI not only appealing
to family physicians/general practitioners, but also to
public health practitioners and health policy makers.
To our knowledge, SHARE-FI represents the first Eur￾opean research effort to facilitate a common language
for frailty in the community and the adoption of the
clinical frailty paradigm in primary care, both of which
were overdue [26,27]. As it currently stands, the main
potential use of SHARE-FI is the screening and moni￾toring of frailty in the community or primary care set￾ting in order to help decide who would benefit from
secondary care referrals and/or early multidisciplinary
case management. To that effect, the advantages of
SHARE-FI are that it can be easily administered in the
community by non-physicians (e.g. nurse, health visitor
or other allied health professionals), and it is a brief
instrument. In view of the prospective mortality results,
pre-frail, as well as frail, subjects should be considered,
regardless of age, for further assessment.
A limitation of our prospective validation was the sig￾nificant proportion of missing mortality data in the
baseline SHARE Wave 1 sample. The results of the
comparison between mortality-available and mortality￾unavailable subgroups (Tables 2 and 3) suggest that
there was a higher burden of frailty at baseline in those
for whom mortality information could not be obtained
at follow-up. However, our sensitivity analysis suggested
that this could have resulted in underestimation of the
age-adjusted mortality odds ratios. To assess the extent
of this underestimation, further prospective validation of
SHARE-FI in other samples is desirable.
Given that SHARE represents the non-institutionalised
population aged 50 and older, we recommend using
SHARE-FI from the age of 50 onwards. Although the
seminal study by Fried et al. only included participants
aged 65 and older [21], international consensus does not
exist on a fixed age cut-off for the definition of frailty,
perhaps in recognition that frailty is more about the bio￾logical age than the chronological age of individuals [33].
In any case, all our correlations were significant inde￾pendently of age (Table 1).
Given its population reference, SHARE-FI would not
be appropriate for the screening of frailty in non-com￾munity settings (e.g. hospitals or geriatric residential set￾tings), as not only SHARE did not target this
population, but the average level of frailty in those set￾tings could make some of the items inapplicable and/or
inappropriate. Even in the community, another potential
limitation of SHARE-FI is its considerable reliance on
self-report, which forms the basis for four out of five
items (i.e. all except handgrip strength). In dementia
cases, proxy report could be of help, but the answers to
the fatigue and appetite items may still be unreliable. In

this light, it is not surprising that the latter two items
had the lowest communalities in the DFactor models.
Cultural influences in the interpretation of these subjec￾tive items may also be responsible for the variable pre￾valences of frailty between European countries
previously reported by Santos-Eggimann et al. [6]. The
methodology described in this paper may be applied to
the construction of country-specific SHARE-FI calcula￾tors, although this approach has the risk of underpower.
Conclusions
We created and validated the SHARE Frailty Instrument,
a simple frailty screening instrument for primary care
based on the first Wave of the Survey of Health, Ageing
and Retirement in Europe. SHARE-FI has sufficient con￾struct and predictive validity, and is readily and freely
accessible via web calculators (see Additional file 1 and
Additional file 2). To our knowledge, SHARE-FI repre￾sents the first European research effort towards a com￾mon frailty language at the community level. The
Survey for Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe, in
its completed and future waves, is providing, and will
continue to provide, excellent opportunities for the
scientific study of frailty in Europe.
